fathers sword He fought with it in many battles Its seen much blood The gods are proud of our weapons and so are we My brother earned this saving our village Saving it from what beast beast with teeth as long as your arms And eyes as red as fire was away on a voyage Only Frithjof saw the beast How far behind are they Not far enough Can you talk with them Explain about your brother cannot go back was to stay on the shore and wait for my father to return But looked around was the one who found the enemy soldiers m the reason why men are dead Its my fault that Frithjof is dead How could look at my father Besides hes not a man to reason with We could fight them Hmm One kill and you think youre a warrior These men have destroyed countries There are songs sung about these men to warn off evil

heir who will unite nations She knows something We must find that girl Sven will not hesitate Both my sons are dead Giants mountain is mentioned in this book Remember my father would tell us stories

your things We must make leave Were doing very well on our own And were very thankful for your help but will take things from here think we should go with her do not like her Come mean you no harm m a friend Friend Friends do not hide in the shadows had to be sure that you were the one What one The markings on your back How did you find us Cadoc was able to get message to us that you were still alive and on your journey Yeah was supposed to meet Cadoc He was butchered We lost track of you so each night scoured these lands searching for you dont understand long time ago a prophecy was made speaking of a Princess who would bring about change and unite the kingdoms Your path has been set Where does it lead All in good time know When was younger Christians invaded our village They took our scrolls and they killed my people You make it sound like a pillaging It was a necessary evil for the greater good The scrolls along with six other texts were retrieved and placed in my fathers possession Typical Christian You think you have the power to rule the world You think you can take what you want You think we all should bow down to you Actually the texts arent meant for us Orlaith it was your bloodline that was chosen to one day unite all countries under one king But cannot be king No but you can be queen And more importantly mother to the king So who is supposed to be the father Thats been taken care of too All in good time Necessary evil These are dangerous times and were to protect the kingdom How well can you use it Well enough We should rest We have another day of traveling tomorrow Sister Kale What is the marking for Ink lives longer than memories my child You were very young when that was burned to you Oh you cried so much You must have hated us at the time dont remember Thats what mean Burning the ink into your skin is the only way we could tell who you are dont understand why Finian didnt tell me He was protecting you and most likely teaching you humility and strength Very important qualities Finian played a far greater part than he would have liked But it will not be in vain Sister Kale you made it back Sir Callaway you look very comfortable Yes its um fit for a king you might say Cyneric is inside And you must be the Princess Oh was not informed of your beauty What a great honor this is This must be your guard This is Sven Shall we step inside We have much to discuss Come Could you stay out here Allow me to introduce Cyneric son of Redda heir to the one true throne Finally you two meet It is a momentous occasion Weve waited so long for this day will ensure you have everything you need Thank you sister Kale Sir Callaway has everything covered You must be Orlaith Orlaith name as beautiful as its owner Can someone tell me what is going on You have not been told You see Cyneric is your betrothed You are to be the new rulers You are to unite all kingdoms under one king You cant just stroll into my life and throw me into a marriage Where is my say in all of this This is what your parents would have wanted But my parents arent here Where were you ten years ago can see you need some time to think Let us give you some peace Please excuse us Cyneric Orlaith cannot tell you what to do But trust me when say that this is what your parents would have wanted know things have changed but it saw them leave Take some time to think things over Would you accompany me please Sven You know you cannot stay with her And why is that You are Norse She is Christian Youre from different worlds You are to unite the countries That is what you said Under the right king yes Ah you think will take the throne for myself think you could stand in her way yes What are you going to do about it will give you the opportunity to walk away now would never What about your father will take care of my father He has no interest in uniting countries Does Orlaith have to be involved in your feud He doesnt just come for me he comes for the scrolls If fail he will come for you too We will be stronger together Look you stand in the way of Orlaiths future Her destiny She was chosen just like Cyneric for her bloodlines man does not become who he is because of his name It must be proven through what he does in life m not saying that you are not a good man But you are no king Dont worry Sister Kale will convince her Were so close to getting the texts You dont think they suspected anything do you Why would they They dont know who Cyneric is Theyve never met him before As long as you dont mess up m sorry master Stop calling me that Youre royalty now remember ve been waiting so long for this moment What moment For this unity of course Were you looking for us No was just talking to Sven He was in front of me He mustve walked back to camp Then we should probably do the same We should not trust that animal alone with the Princess Orlaith ve gone with this for long enough Wheres Sven Were not staying It looks as if your guard has left you Sven Sven Hes no doubt left you my lady No doubt raping and pillaging as we speak m here Well as long as were all here shall we go back inside heard them in the forest Theyre not who they say they are They want the scrolls too We cannot trust them We could go now Sister Kale could be in danger cant Sven Then we fight have a better idea Nice of you to join us Orlaith Please have a seat So sister how far is it to travel now Not far And the ceremony Please sir Callaway Patience is a virtue Forgive me sister Kale My curiosity gets the better of me By the time we reach Saint Augustines father Edwin will have prepared the text that will allow them to be joined in marriage before the eyes of god He will wish to proceed without delay Hmm What are those maps for over there Yes well we needed to find you What is this Are you trying to poison me Orlaith what are you doing This is his doing No think you should leave Orlaith whats gotten into you These men are not who they say they are do not hope this is not a sign of things to come should think a little more respect is in order Wait If he is the true heir then you will have a symbol as do correct Of course You do have the markings dont you Of course he does but it would be inappropriate for him to disrobe in front of women should think given the circumstances it would be highly appropriate He does not have to prove himself to you He is the heir to the throne Sven was right Tell us who you really are You meddling bitch m surprised you dont remember me Sven Big brave hero returns You leave her Drop your weapon Good boy Now how do find the texts Is that what youre after know all about your little plan ve searched for those texts for years and ve killed so many to find them Those scrolls belong to the rightful heir The rightful heir Do you think the world will just bow down to you simply because you have their holy texts No you need a strong fearless leader Someone who know how to use those texts And you are fearless have had just about enough of you Well see how fearless you are with a sword through your sk Stay back ll do it Stay back Stay back No no No more please Have mercy on me please Have mercy Shall we leave Why have we stopped here These mountains are in the book They are coming From where do not know We wait m sorry doubted you Sven Youre a good man What happens now Well meet with father and see what he says Theres a council awaiting the new king and queen This is going to be an interesting one to explain There told you We will follow them Looks like they have company The scrolls must be close Perhaps the gods smile on us after all Who is it It is father Weve returned Ah Father this is Orlaith She is the daughter of Fedelmid Ah it is an honor You must be Cyneric Sir Callaway has told me all about you My name is Sven The man you speak of is dead Is that so Then we have much to discuss m sorry to hear about Finian my dear But lets not dwell We have cause for celebration No thank you Nonsense Here Yeah see Good mead My own recipe So what about this prince Cyneric We may have a complication there Well what about this strong looking fellow here Thats the complication Are you of noble descent my boy Father is king He left our lands to find the scroll that was taken from us He wont leave without it But hes Norse father Is that so Well then we do have a problem So this is my destiny It doesnt seem so wonderful We could leave now Sven You dont have to go along with this Its not that You could have left me You could have not trusted me You stayed with me want to stay with you What are you saying What is the difference Between my gods and yours What help have they been You cant give up on your beliefs Its who you are ve never known who am until now Youve proven yourself enough What you believe in shouldnt matter Your path is laid out for you do not know mine except to be with you will forsake anything for that Do you renounce all faiths except the one true faith Arise today with a mighty strength the invocation of the Trinity through a confession of the oneness of the creator of creations This was mine and d like you to wear it All that fighting for this Every warrior needs a sword It looks good on you She is right It does suit you Sven Its my father You are dressed like a dog You turned your back on your people on your family All ever wanted was a good name and youve tried to end that Well Now m going to end you like the dog you are What do you want from me father wanted a good son wanted my name remembered want Frithjof back Frithjof didnt
