a love interest for Rashanna To experience for the duration of this campaign And really like the idea of her falling in love with your character And ve already created a backstory How she lost her husband to a freak white dragon accident And is now in tremendous mental turmoil Because of her sudden rebound So shes very vulnerable And she needs somebody to protect her But Magmald went celibate We can work around that Handwritten resum Never seen one in calligraphy Thanks You realize this job requires you to move to our headquarters in Seattle m not at liberty to tell you too much about the project Other than its an Alternative Reality Game blend of online and offline gaming Epic The game director position is not gonna be an easy one You are gonna have to manage a team of over people And m not seeing anything on your resum Look m uh m the leader of a of a guild My main character actually has a full set Of fifth tier heroic level Yeah ve also spent more than hours Look ve seen over people for this position And theyre all saying the same thing over and over again Tier five If you want this job You need to stand out and prove to me that youre the complete package Gamer Yeah Leader can lead people sir Look m not gonna make a decision for another week Can you put together something in the next day or two That will prove to me that you can lead people Yeah look forward to seeing what you bring back Me too Why cant do that It doesnt make any sense Why cant go through the high plains pass Voss its your brother You were supposed to be here minutes ago Where are you If you are not here in five minutes swear to you am doubling your rent And if see you will choke you out It wasnt snowing What the hell are you talkin about You said it was fall not winter Well lets see The turtlebuds havent bloomed yet All the rabbits have gone south ss well as the plains wolves Which is the only food source for the Beast Lord So that would make it think Uh yeah Winter Its bullcrap Bullcrap Right Right Am right Hi Right Right Yeah Come on fantasy pants what are you gonna change now m incredibly unsatisfied with the particular inconsistencies of this game m just sayin have a vote d like to bring before the guild have a lot of friends that would like to join this game But unfortunately it sucks three things Turkey balls troll and ass would like to propose that become the new game master And manage the rest of this campaign can promise you by next friday Well have at least a dozen new people involved That includes healers Who agrees Its settled then ll run the guild this week This is my campaign No its not We took a vote Voss Its the rolePlaying My characters a barbarian Has some control issues Thanks Well think could give it a go under one condition That you Destroy the Beast Lord Bring it weak sauce And if you lose Magmald dies Never to be resurrected And you have to leave the guild forever Dont do it Dont do it Dont do it Lets do it Fine Do it cast righteous indignation Thats a Foot barrier of protection against projectiles ll also be drinking my potion of bull strength Dont forget fire Resistance to fire come down from the astral plane Which was never in Ah ah Ah And raise my sword to heronius Adding plusThree to my hit and damage Yes yes yes Well Thats pretty hot stuff Why dont you roll a saving throw Against the Beast Lords psyonic death stare while youre at it Come on man When did the Beast Lord get psyonics When he was a baby Beast Lord Whatever Lets do this critical failure Unless you roll something greater than eight you will die Thank you Five five five five five Well the dice dont lie Its just a game What your pegasus get ringworm Have to be put down Shut up Heronius Ahh Ahhhhhh Aaaaaahhh was born in the wrong universe Phhht That Was

Hoping for the day When shall again see you faceToFace My darling little sushi roll Our love shall be Like a disgraced samurai yes What Impaled with his own sword Oh Well Everyone out Off the stage Lets go Hmm Of all the invitations ve given you For what reason do you grace this pleasant stage After we find the brain juice What if Rashanna goes to the hills of monyar And finds a rod of resurrection to bring Magmald back That would divert too much attention from the narrative More important than Vosss tattered ego Is that youve come to see my play Its an unlikely love story About a woman Who loves a man Is there Is there anything that the guild can do for Voss The only ointment for someone feeling sorry for themselves my darling Is to help them realize that they suck Morning sunshine What happened with that interview Its really close between me and one other guy got you set up monday morning Taco shop Be there Its Marsha Sorry Hey Marsha Would you like to come over for breakfast chicken Hello made you something Its a cape and uh it has flannel on the inside So it can double as a blanket and keep you warm Oh Thank you Marsha Absolutely Oh wow Clancy Hes total Hes

wicked hobgoblin king Enslaves a village of eggLaying gnomes Forcing them to hard labor and into the swamps mean could see our combined sacrifice to save them As being just shy of legendary And also the Love interest idea which mentioned the other day Between Magmald and Rashanna Could easily be folded into this plot line Which think is necessary dont get what a surfaceDwelling hobgoblin has to do with the svirfneblin m glad you said something think Clancys just trying to say that You cant up and willyNilly a campaign together know mean right guess was just thinking That the entire guild would abandon Shadow Hawk if If they knew that you were creating your own new guild mean theyve always trusted your leadership in the game so why wouldnt they trust you in real life But thats stupid Its for monkey brains and unless What Do you need the Heimlich Magmald Yeah UhHuh yeah Yeah Okay Explain figured out how m gonna get the job at warlock m gonna create a land of magic and wonder m

and her lover head down to the party With the head rollin right behind Lets roll to the party like we roll them polyhedral dice Lets roll a d not once not times but thrice Lets roll with the punches from our mortal enemies and foes Lets roll creatures lets roll Meet the beastly hes the Beast Lord Hes shootin laser beams like oh my word So retaliate with my psyonic death stare But ricocheted through the floor So entice that dude with some turtlebuds And the shining glitter tassels on my luscious duds He falls into my trance and we begin to dance Now we rockin this mortals club Lets roll to the party like we roll them polyhedral dice Lets roll a d not once not times but thrice Lets roll with the punches from our mortal enemies and foes Lets roll creatures lets roll We gotta roll down to the area where all the cool kids go We gotta get there get there real fast Cause were rollin were rollin the dice Polyhedral dice baby yeah
