Gladio case is still open They claim that the organization is now unmasked and that this decision is a mistake Some lawyers say that unless all members of Gladio are not brought to daylight the organization can never be destroyed The future will show whos right One thing is for sure Gladio will stay on Turkeys agenda for a long time
