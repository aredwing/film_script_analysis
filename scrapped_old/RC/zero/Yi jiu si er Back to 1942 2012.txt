Greetings to our compatriots around China and overseas Today is the st New Years Day since the founding of the Republic of China and the fifth New Years Day that we have spent at war Since our declaration of war against Japan and the Axis powers on December of last year our war of resistance has entered a new phase and Chinas war with Japan has become a world war The duty of China is now all the greater and the burden of our people and our army is all the weightier We must renew and redouble our efforts On this first day of the new year will discuss with the public the past present and future of this war Over the past halfyear and particularly the past month our war of resistance has changed utterly Before ours was a solitary struggle within our own country against the Japanese invaders Today we have joined Great Britain the United States and Soviet Union and other friendly nations in fighting side by side to rid the world of our common enemies Our burden is the responsibility of the Republic of China to world civilization and morality As long as the Japanese invaders and the Axis powers remain on this earth as long as world civilization and morality remain under threat we shall continue to shoulder this heavy burden The outcome of this war will determine not only the survival of our nation but the future of all mankind Victory for China will lay a strong foundation for generations to come Defeat will push our people past the point of no return My fellow countrymen From the winter of to the spring of a terrible drought starved my home province

can you spare a moment Sure Thanks a lot There is a lot of talk in Chungking about the severity of the drought in Henan ve heard that many people are starving to death every day And there are many refugees fleeing to Shaanxi This is true But starvation is primarily a problem in the occupied areas The war has made this natural disaster even worse large battle is imminent If people are moving west it is also to avoid the war From the perspective of the Chinese people they can only have enough to eat if the Japanese are wiped out Do agree Shuanzhu Master Fan Xialu Youre running too Is the whole village leaving Everyone Lets go together Well look after each other Lets go We can take care of each other Lets go The drought cant be all bad if its making the Fans poor too Poor maybe Still

Please Theres no need for all the courtesy Governor Lets get straight to the point What can do for you Henan experienced a devastating drought this year We also had locusts The land is barren and the corpses of those who have starved are everywhere is more than the province can give Please general cancel the request The people are suffering You are quite right governor agree Thank you commander for your kindness The children of Henan will never forget your compassion But you need to do two things for me Only two ll do twenty First go to the Japanese and talk them out of attacking Henan Second go to the Generalissimo and get him to move my troops back west to Shaanxi Do that and we wont eat a single kernel of your grain Commander its not like that Famine years are different There are millions of people starving to death Governor Li there are tens of millions of men marching to the front Who knows how many of them will live to next month If its a matter of choosing who will starve a dead refugee wont lose the war for us soldier starving to death is another matter entirely Good day Commander Thats not right All gone Well starve if we keep going Theres people going hungry and youre feeding a cat m giving her my share just wont eat later all right Youre eating for two You can have more later Master Fan The donkey has the runs Should feed it If we can get through this in a

the hellish fate of starvation This is all my fault just got back from Guangxi yesterday This Wang Yunsheng hes the editor of Ta Kung Pao Yes Poisoning peoples minds Shut his paper down Shut his paper down But Wang Yunsheng has been invited by the Office of Strategic Services He will leave for America in a few days At this dont think he should go Even more people are talking about the war in Henan Theyre say were abandoning Henan and leaving the refugees to the Japanese Its an open secret When did we say we were giving up on Henan Set the record straight with an editorial Set the record straight with an editorial in the Central Daily News Yes sir Right away The Generalissimo will see Mr Wilkie off at the airport You only have fifteen minutes You understand Chinese right Yes Then wont have to translate for you But am going to have to speak English okay Okay Generalissimo This is Mr White Mr White ve heard of you Nice to see you Honorable Generalissimo It grieves me to report to you that thirty million people in Henan dont have enough food to eat Each day an increasing number of refugees are starving to death He is reporting on the situation in Henan He says many people are starving Its been explained to me by some officials it is because there is a war going on but was there and it appears as if the Japanese havent started an attack on Henan He says the government must not know whats happening Officials say its because of the war but the Japanese havent started attacking Henan There is indeed a famine but its not as severe as you say With all due respect Generalissimo ve heard that people are now resorted to eating each other He heard theres been cannibalism Impossible Something like that could never happen in China ve seen dogs eating people ve seen it ve seen it Sir He saw it himself ve seen it Sir Please never imagined things could be so bad If the famine is indeed as severe as you say then the government will surely take action These selfsatisfied Americans Theyre nothing but trouble If those pictures get published theyll call me the Generalissimo who sat by while his people suffered heartless despot Farewell Farewell Farewell Farewell Whites article about the Henan famine has been published in Time Should confiscate all the copies of Time in China No Buy as many copies as possible Have the Foreign Ministry translate it into Chinese Send a copy to every minister and provincial governor Add Li Peijis reports at the end We need to send relief as soon as the Japanese leave Otherwise what will the rest of the world think Wed be as corrupt as they say we are Contact Yan Xishan Have them immediately send supplies to the disaster area Then tell Zhang Lisheng to mobilize all of China to raise relief funds for the refugees There are times when miss the old Northern Expedition days All had to do was give the order and my men would leap into action had no burdens keeping me from standing with the people How is she She lost a lot of blood and with the cold her pulse is very weak Youve got to do something If you save her ll give you two acres of land when this is over Master Fan the cure is very simple Just give her some food If you want to know my mother and my grandchildren died of hunger on the road these past two days m so hungry cant walk straight Master Fan Master Fan hurry What is it She stopped breathing She was a good daughterinlaw dont know what ll tell her family letting her die like this What are you doing Give the baby some milk while her body is still warm My god What She hasnt eaten in five days She is as thin as a stick How can she have milk Gentlemen After urgent appeals from the provincial government the central government has started providing relief aid to Henan Starting this month the central government will provide million pounds of grain from the military provisions Gentlemen Governor Lis deep concern for the public welfare and fearless dedication have finally paid off He not only went to Chungking but he also submitted six reports Future generations of Henanese will remember Governor Lis kindness Lets discuss the matter of delivering the relief grain Yes Sir How can we have this meeting The heads of the grain and account departments are both absent Thats not right Mr Lu and Mr Peng have gone to Luoyang to inspect the disaster We cant delay relief efforts by another moment After all our begging theyre only offering million pounds When there was a famine in Hubei last year the government gave more than million pounds Do we sell ourselves so cheaply in Henan Is million pounds enough We have million people Each person only gets two and half pounds Thats enough for three days What happens after that Mr Fang getting million pounds is better than having to give million pounds After we get this we can ask for more take care of the emergency It may even save a few hundred thousand people Am right Today the main task is to define the disaster areas Define the disaster areas The entire province is a disaster area Mr Fang It is precisely because there is not enough to go around that we cant distribute grain at random We have to focus on the worst areas agree that we should focus our efforts But in the past weve concentrated on rural areas and neglected the cities And its in the cities that we see the problems m not saying this just because cities are my jurisdiction But remember when the Yellow River flooded and the provincial government was attacked When choosing our focus We should consider certain professions m not saying this because m in charge of education but education is our future The Generalissimo has always said so We mustnt focus on the refugees at the expense of other groups If our teachers and students starve to death well have no future to save So far as focus goes as the captain of police need to speak up for the hundreds of thousands of police who are also frightened Because theyre busy in our areas of focus Wherever theres trouble theyre there to keep order dare say if it werent for the thousands of police braving hunger and enforcing law and order we would already have had a revolution in Henan enough for anything The police are among the refugees What are you arguing for What are you arguing for Before we got this aid you were constantly complaining about it Now that weve got it youre tearing each other to pieces over it If d known never would have asked Its still not too late to send the grain back Gentlemen Each department is focused on its own problems You all have good reasons As for how we define whos a refugee And who isnt we can discuss that later must emphasize that in distributing this relief grain we cannot be selfish We must act under the leadership of the provincial government If thats how it is why bother having this meeting Cant the two of you just decide between yourselves Fang what are you trying to say Telegram Mr Governor Whats going on today Governor What now Does the government want to take it back The government doesnt want it back Weve been ambushed by Jiang Dingwen Remember the million pounds of grain he wanted Hes detained the head of the grain department Lao Lu and the head of the accounts department Lao Peng They are both with Jiang Hell release them in exchange for grain You all like arguing so much Why dont you go argue with Jiang Dingwen In a famine year giving Jiang Dingwen a gift like this m no better than the rest of them Jiang Dingwen will take bribes gift of million pounds of grain will not only get us our hostages back but it might even change his mind about the million pounds That would be in Henans best interests too Governor Li When exchanged gold bars bought an extra pounds of grain What Why didnt you tell me You were at the meeting No one will think youre right if you allocate all of the grain as planned Itll only cause more problems Old Fang is always making trouble at meetings dont know what he wants He headed up the civil affairs department for a long time Before you came he was the top choice to be governor Then Generalissimo Chiang changed his mind can contact Generalissimo Chiang immediately and resign He can take over He can go speak to Jiang Dingwen If you want the central government to give you more then dont you need to pay visits to others cant stay on as an official should retire and go home Governor Li If wed retired wed probably be refugees now too This is a broadcast from the first military districts political department and the Luoyang municipal government To support the war effort and safeguard military supplies and to keep out traitors and maintain civic order only residents of Luoyang will be permitted into the city Those who willfully disobey will be prosecuted under Section Nine Article Three of the Wartime City Management Regulations Go You want to die Sir Isnt the government providing relief aid Where can we get food The government has identified two disaster areas northern and southern Henan Now that youre in Luoyang youre no longer considered a refugee Then how can become a refugee Turn around and walk a few hundred miles North or south it doesnt matter Mom Mom Morn Dad What Whats wrong with Mom Mom Morn Dead Morn Dead is good No more suffering She can move on to her next life In your next life dont come back here Our commander is deeply concerned for the common people so he is allocating some military grain to be sold to refugees at a low price to help them with their difficulties give this responsibility to you Act prudently whatever you do The countrys fate hangs in the balance You must not act out of selfinterest Trust me sir may be a businessman but ve got more of a heart than those corrupt officials If were you d take your share and use it to buy
