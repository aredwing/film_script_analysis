They think its about Gods wrath and anger They love it when God gets angry What is the story about then The ark Well think its a love story about believing in each other You know the animals showed up in pairs They stood by each other side by side just like Noah and his family Everybody entered the ark side by side But my husband says God told him to do it What do you do with that Sounds like an opportunity Let me ask you something If someone prays for patience you think God gives them patience Or does he give them the opportunity to be patient If they pray for courage does God give them courage or does he give them opportunities to be courageous If someone prayed for their family to be closer you think God zaps them with warm fuzzy feelings Or does he give them opportunities to love each other Well got to run lot of people to serve Enjoy Guess this comes as no surprise to those who remember his campaign promise will lower taxes go crazy and build a gigantic ark Oh my gosh Evan

approval to build a dam and then passed out the surrounding lands to a group of private investors Now the locals fought this thing for years They said Long and his developer buddies were cutting corners like skipping important building code checkpoints And with the land use bill hes gonna do the same thing with the national parks So you stand by and shake your pompoms while Long and his buddies get rich What can we do m suspended Go back to the Hill and show them that you can and will fight this bill You guys m sorry cant do that have to get back to the ark The ark All right Okay God
