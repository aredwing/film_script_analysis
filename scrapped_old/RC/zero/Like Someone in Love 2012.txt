used to teach here You were a teacher here What did you teach What you are studying So you know this book by heart More or less will wait for you here might be a bit late have time can take you wherever you want We can you to eat You didnt eat anything this morning What is your name Watanabe Takashi Excuse me do you have light Thank you Excuse me but who are you Do have to answer Just wondering could ask you the same Who are you Can come in m Higuchi Noriaki Hi Watanabe Takashi Nice to meet you What relationship do you have with Akiko What do you think Her grandpa Definitely not her father thought her grandma was here Nice to meet you And you What is your relationship with her m her fiance have asked her many times to introduce me to her family She told me you are not okay Is your knee any better Yes thank you So can come to introduce myself to you officially You mean to marry her Yes Nowadays people get married without consent of the family For me however its important What is your job What did you study have a small business left school when was know that some people prefer to lose time in college wanted to work When my buddies are in need they come find me What is your business about car repair shop When things get hard do other things Work its something important but you are both very young to marry You lack the experience You think so have been with several and girls dont need experience before marriage think its the right moment Seeing you together earlier things didnt seem to be so great We have our disagreements but its nothing serious You shouldnt hesitate about the issue of marriage As my grandfather used to say When you meet your better half marry her Dont let her go You dont have to overanalyse everything understand what you are saying though Its difficult to understand women If loose her wont find another like her Why would you lose her if its so good between you Yes that is true will be honest How to say it For example when people have problems they often discuss them We however we dont She says Who do you think you are Youre not my husband And indeed m not Her phone was off all night No explanation She told me something about the battery She didnt give me a clear answer Isnt it weird Indeed it is So you understand Thats why want to marry her That way she wont have a choice She knows nothing about life You should also know we live in a jungle She tells me know m studying sociology What do they teach them in here As if the dusty books will open their eyes This city is merciless and dangerous worry for her So will marry her That way will be able to protect her To reassure the family Last night she turned off her phone at We were talking and she hung up and now shes playing it hard understand On the other hand even if you get married she might still leave your questions unanswered What will you do then If we get married she will be obliged to answer me Ideally yes Thats why tell you that you lack experience Not at all Experience means to accept the lies To accept everything When you know you will be lied to its better not to ask Thats what experience teaches us What are you implying say forget the marriage Why love her Who told you not to love her m telling you not to marry her And not to ask her many questions or to accept her answers no matter what they are When you understand this then you are mature enough to marry This also applies to women m not sure The only thing you care about is to defend your granddaughter As much as she is my granddaughter also are you m her grandfather as much as m yours m just telling you how things are You can either accept it or reject it told you my opinion Your only goal is to discourage me Did Akiko talk to you about me You told Noriaki that your grandma was
