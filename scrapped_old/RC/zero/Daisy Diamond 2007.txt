no turning back Afraid of the responsibility Afraid of being tied down Afraid of losing the theater afraid of the pain of dying Afraid of your swelling body But you keep playing the part The part of a happy young expectant mother Everyone said Shes so beautiful More beautiful than ever before You tried several times to procure an abortion but in vain When you realized it was irrevocable you hated the child You wished for it to be stillborn You wished your baby would die at birth You wanted a stillborn child It was a long and complicated birth that dragged out for several days They had to deliver the child by forceps You regarded the disfigured child with revulsion and whispered Please die soon Please die But he survived The boy cried day and night and you hated him You were scared You were plagued by guilt Finally relatives and a nanny took care of the baby And you could rise and return to the theater It wont do if you dont remember your lines m sorry but my daughter was sick all night Well your daughter isnt auditioning for the part is she But your troubles werent over The little boy developed an intense love for his mother You tried to avoid it because you felt you couldnt

they rung false told him to revise the dialogue or didnt want to be in his film More wine Or something else Wine is fine Your scene turned out great It did It worked well with you and Sofie You have a great way with actors You think so Its a relief to meet a competent director who doesnt have to assert himself all the time Cheers Youve chosen a tough racket but think youre going to make it You do wouldnt say it otherwise Youve got presence and an interesting face Youve got selfdiscipline You have to be passionate about your work If its just a fad you might as well forget it ve always wanted to be an actress Like when you were a kid and dressed up way of escape Want to make me happy know Its a lot to ask but need your help Its no big deal just want you to talk to me Not about anything in particular Anything you like What were having for dinner or if the seas cold after the storm Can ask you something Yes How would you like to go back to my place and have sex Think of it as a casting Itll make it easier for me to recommend you to other directors always thought great artists sympathized with others thought their art sprung from a need to help others How stupid of me Talk to me

Thomas said you spoke fluent Danish Rapunzel is Danish and doesnt talk Swedish Well have to replace you How about dinner sometime Youre incredibly beautiful Let me give you my phone number love being a director Know what love even more That special chemistry between two people whove only just met and who dont have a flying fuck in common Are you married Is that something you need to know before the rest of the night unfolds Think you have to take off your panties in order to play Rapunzel No If choose to fuck you tonight it doesnt affect my marriage Youre gone tomorrow If youre a good lay and remember you you get to play Rapunzel next time Does that answer your question sense youre a real actress Free of any real pain Nothing really hurts you If it hurts you use it in a scene envy you that Your superficiality Everything rolls off on you know what mean Know what love actresses Particularly when they get too old Like youll be someday That pain Not because its a meaningless warridden violent evil world no youre in pain because no one wants to look at you anymore You have too many wrinkles Your charms lost its charm Your ass is saggy your boobs are droopy Thats when it comes creeping in the pain But its a gift for you because itll make a real actress out of you Just a shame its too late That pain is the only thing that will ever be real to you To hell with the world The tragedy of the world is that no one sees you Suddenly theres nothing left of you and what you thought was your life Nothing but the empty shell craving attention That desperate folly for some reason respect that You dont feel hurt do you Why do you think m here What do you mean If didnt think could fuck my way to a part wouldnt waste an entire evening on a jerk like you would Dont be miffed Give me a smile dont want to Thats more like it just wrote a script with a female lead Its Joan of Arc as an animated film About a woman who really believes in something Whos got conviction principles
