staying right where m supposed to You do that Good morning sheriff Hello Burdette Been expecting you want to see my brother You can come in But that doesnt mean the rest of you Hes not your brother Go on across the street with the others Do as he says Whatre all those people doing in town didnt ask Didnt ask them to come or ask them why theyre here But think theyre watching to see what youre gonna do You dont like that do you Too many witnesses Now do you wanna keep talking to me or see your brother See my brother Were coming in Stumpy Well come ahead Dont wait for me to carry you All right Stumpy open up Whats the password Come on Oh m coming wouldnt miss this Just want him to see how were set up Well look whos here Place is getting all cluttered up with Burdettes Come right in Mr Burdette That fellow round the corner with a bangedup face is your brother Nathan Well Joe Looks like they gave you a goingover Our friend here Why He didnt take too kindly to being arrested for murder It wasnt murder If he says it wasnt murder why do you say it was Man gets shot thats got a gun theres room for reasonable doubt Man gets shot that hasnt got a gun what would you call it But you knew that already otherwise you wouldnt have set things up the way you did Just what have done Youre a rich man Burdette Big ranch Pay a lot of people to do what you want them to do And you got a brother Hes no good but hes your brother If he committed murders youd try and see he didnt hang for them dont like that kind of talk Youre accusing me Lets get this straight You dont like dont like a lot of things dont like your men sitting on the road bottling up this town dont like your men watching us trying to catch us with our backs turned And dont like it when a friend of mine offers to help and minutes later hes dead And dont like you Burdette because you set it up Whatre you gonna do about it thought youd get around to that m gonna sit here with your brother in my lap until the United States marshal gets here Thatll be about six days He may ask a few questions about that busted wheel But think youre too smart to have stopped that stage completely Now m running out of breath You talk if you want to He talks awful big for a man thats all alone except for a barfly and a cripple You can get me out of here any Shut up Joe Youre not as smart as your brother Joe He sees Stumpy here sitting around the corner looked in with you And if that isnt plain enough ll tell you why If any trouble starts around this jail before anybody can get to you youre gonna get accidentally shot can practical guarantee that see you still have a little grudge against us Four hundred and sixty acres might be little to you Nathan But it was a lot of country to me Dont take no chances Nathan He looks just crazy enough to shoot me Hes smarter than thought You know a court might just call that murder too Oh hell whats the difference Wed all be dead by then You got anything else you wanna say Burdette Just one thing Joe has friends You cant hold Joe or me responsible for them what you say theyve done or what they might do want to make that clear Well ll help you make it clear dont think Joes got a friend in the world And he wont have any unless somebody buys them for him at a head Like the fellow that shot Wheeler You made it clear All right Stumpy Nathan Just sit tight Joe Send me a bottle before you leave town You do that because part of my job is to see that it aint poisoned Now sometimes it takes quite a spell to find out He didnt have much to say did he No Whatd you leave him go for You had plenty to hold him on Anything theyre gonna do is planned already or he wouldnt have come in here Throwing him in with Joe would give him an alibi for whatever happens never thought of that What do you think happen dont know You can think cant you Any man can think told you to get back in there and stay with that door locked Careful how you talk to me You hear what Joe said Youre alone except for a barfly and an old cripple Calling me an old cripple like hearing you say that Joe gotta fix your supper for you tonight Seor Chance Seor Chance Its me Carlos Come on in What do you want wanna talk to you Did the girl get What happened to your eye You told me to put the lady on the stage Oh she did that What did you do She did not do it thought you said she did say You tell me to

Burdette He wanted to talk to his brother Whatd he have to say Nothing You mean he didnt say anything Why are you so interested Because hes talking now Hear that music He told the man to play it What is it They call it The Deguello The Cutthroat Song The Mexicans played it for those Texas boys when they had them bottled up in the Alamo Played it day and night till it was all over Now do you know what he means by it No quarter No mercy for the losers Youll be hearing a lot of it guess we made him talk after all Just thought youd like to know sheriff Stumpy What They dont need any help with that tune Whats the matter is it getting through to you By the way the stage got off all right watched it clear through the valley In about six days the marshal will get here Thats what figured Oh the girl wasnt on the stage know that Tell her she could stay No she Yes did What about it Nothing nothing at all You were going to say something remembered in time remembered another girl came through on a stage that stopped over remember you told me she was no good didnt believe you but you were right So naturally figured youre an expert And you know just what youre doing all the time just hope you
