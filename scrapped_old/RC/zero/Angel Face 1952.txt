day gather that was when you told her about your plans for this garage Yes thats right We got to talking see It doesnt really make any difference but did you or she suggest the possibility of my investing in it Mrs Tremayne when we talked about my shop had no thought of coming here to work ve been saving my own money and So it was Dianes suggestion Well with her interest in sports cars Of course Well thank you Frank ll call my lawyer today Oh dont want you to feel that youre a prisoner here In the evening mean Surely you have a girl Yes shes working the late shift at the hospital this

Oh hes a very nice young man ll send the papers over to you Or better still Oh see Well then when you come back from San Francisco Call me Goodbye Arthur Now that ve completed the timeworn gesture you expect me to ask the usual favor Do At this precise moment you are with the speed of a mechanical brain weighing and computing an infinite number of possibilities Such as Well one hes spent this months allowance Two hes borrowed against next months allowance Three hes charged something at a store which he promised word of honor hed never do again And four hes just kissed you because hes very sorry and he loves you very much And are you guilty on all four counts All especially the fourth Oh m terribly sorry darling but the moment saw that dress knew there was only one person in the world

it to the police No Frank We mustnt do that Why not Shed deny it and we have no proof The police couldnt do anything They didnt before Now ve been thinking about that too If shes trying to kill you

We got a call from up there one night Yeah know got the report right here Asphyxiation case Mrs Tremayne probably accidental Sure makes you wonder dont it What do you mean She claimed somebody tried

This morning when took it out of the garage You notice anything wrong with it Not a thing Well do you remember whether you left it in gear In reverse maybe No No d say not With me its automatic to shift into neutral before cut a motor Yeah Oh Is that so All right bring it in Getting back to the stepdaughter You say she had no boyfriends huh Well not that know of You and the girl werent planning to run off together now were you No Then how do you account for her suitcase in your room Well that is the suit Hold it If were in your spot Frank d hire myself a lawyer You can imagine what a shock it was d known Catherine for years Her father was one of my first clients Did you draw up the will Two years ago Tremayne was to get a fixed income as long as he lived He wasnt very practical about money The bulk of the estate was to go to Diane The district attorney will use that against us Hello Kelly Oh hello Mr Barrett Were here to see Miss Diane Tremayne Come in Youre looking good boy Thanks This is Mr Barrett Sergeant Hello Sergeant And Arthur Vance Good morning Good morning Sergeant wish you wouldnt speak too much about her father Todays the first day that shes gone without sedatives She idolized the man Fred Its no wonder her nerves have cracked Teresa Hello Teresa Hello Right over there Legal eagle Barrett That Tremayne dame really must be in trouble Quiet Warner Thats no way to talk Tremayne Miss Tremayne your lawyers are here Diane this is Fred Barrett Hes going to handle your defense Fred is just about the best trial man in the country and we were very lucky to get him But dont want anyone to defend me know just how you feel Its the most natural reaction in the world would want my daughter to feel the same Shes just about your age But Diane a girl of has her whole life ahead of her You must not permit your grief understandable as it may be But did it You mustnt say such things Thats all right Let her talk Go ahead did it all by myself Not Frank Youre a very sick girl You know that dont you Otherwise you wouldnt be here know what m saying Sure But the doctor doesnt want you to make any statement Thats why he hasnt permitted the district attorney to question you yet But Frank is innocent The law says youre both innocent until proved guilty Both do you understand Now want you to listen Diane very carefully Everything the district attorney has all the evidence links you and Frank together The motive the means the opportunity It wouldnt do either one of you any good to shoulder the blame or to pass it on It would only convince a jury youre both lying both guilty But m telling the truth The truth is what the jury decides not you not me not Frank If you quit hes through too But if you want to fight he has a chance think a pretty good chance dont have to cooperate Mr Barrett and already have my own attorney Youll keep your own lawyer Mr Lewis is not going to leave the case Of course not But dont think we should disregard Mr Barretts offer To be very blunt Mr Jessup m not particularly interested in saving your neck My only concern is with my client Diane Tremayne Yeah thats what figured But the point is you have a much better chance together than separately And the evidence actually points much more to you than it does to her The fact that an automobile was involved If she thinks she can get away with that shes lost her mind No ones trying to get away with anything But in cases like this you cant overlook the personal equation Shell get a lot of sympathy pretty girl deeply devoted to her father on the best of terms with her stepmother who was a kind and generous woman as you well know Oh do The family lawyer told me she was planning to set you up in a garage business Thats not what Diane said Somebodys lying Probably a misunderstanding but its not important What want to know is whether youre willing to follow our strategy Frank you ought to bear in mind Mr Barretts record Hes never lost a case yet Lets not say never Suppose you tell us what you have in mind Mr Barrett Your client and mine are getting married Were what Just a moment dont quite follow you on this marriage idea Its very simple All the world loves a lover Juries are no exception No Mr Barrett nothing doing The is going to make a lot of that suitcase in his room Hell accuse them of having an affair Well make a virtue of it Certainly they were lovers and not ashamed to admit it But a tragic accident and the intervention of the police prevented their elopement But even prison bars cannot change their love or halt the marriage But wouldnt the district attorney block it He wouldnt dare stand in the path of true love with an election coming up in November Think it over Mr Jessup Let me know his decision as soon as possible now pronounce you man and wife Congratulations Youre married now You may kiss the bride May take just one No pictures please Never let it be said this wedding was arranged with any thought of publicity Congratulations All the happiness in the world Sorry we cant stay to the party We thought youd like a cake so the girls chipped in There aint much we can say but kids we sure hope you beat the rap Have you reached any decision about the plea Not guilty Isnt that too much of a gamble Well what happens if we plead insanity They turn her over to the s psychiatrists You know what that means Questions answers No we wouldnt want that And what if they did find she was off That wouldnt help the man would it Insanitys not contagious at least we cant prove it Besides it would tie up the estate Will you please continue Mr Miller So that rod connected to the gearshift lever on the steering post comes down here and is coupled to the bell crank here by a cotter pin Will you demonstrate just how that operates Mr Miller Yes sir If someone will be good enough to shift in reverse for me Well ll try Thank you Just a moment All right now You see the bell crank moves forward in drive back But if were to remove this cotter pin and uncouple this shifting rod a very simple operation as you can see then no matter what you do with the shift lever the bell crank remains as it was in drive neutral or reverse wherever it may happen to be Thank you You made it quite clear Now Mr Miller will you point out the throttle retractor spring and explain its purpose Yes sir Now this is the throttle retractor spring Its function is to control the amount of gasoline released when youve stepped on the accelerator Was this spring found in the wrecked car No sir This part ladies and gentlemen of the jury was missing from the wrecked Tremayne car Now will you explain what happens if this spring is removed Well a person stepping down on the accelerator opens it wide like putting the gas pedal right to the floor In other words giving the motor full throttle Yes sir Thank you Now this motor was removed from the wrecked Tremayne car under your supervision Yes sir And what did you find in connection with the gearshift rod That there was no connection It had been disconnected and the cotter pin had been removed May the answer be stricken The witness cannot know that the pin or any other part was removed or that anything had been disconnected Motion granted But the cotter pin was missing That is correct And so was the throttle retractor spring It was off too And in what position was the bell crank In neutral in drive or reverse It was in reverse And will you tell the jury in what position was the shift lever on the steering wheel It was pointed at drive Now Mr Miller would you say that in your opinion the Tremayne car had been tampered with Objection As a qualified expert the witness is permitted to express his opinion as to the result of his investigation Exception Well Mr Miller Yes sir would say that it had been tampered with You may crossexamine Mr Barrett Mr Miller it has been testified that the Tremayne automobile fell a total distance of feet hitting and bouncing off rocks in its descent And now you say that strangely enough certain parts of this motor are missing or damaged As look at this heap of metal before me cant help but wonder that any part of it escaped undamaged And as for missing parts do you see a carburetor for instance No sir It was either unrecognizable or couldnt be found but there wasnt as much damage done to the shift mechanism Couldnt the throttle spring have been dislodged by the impact of the crash The very fact that it was a spring with play in it would make me be inclined to think Forgetting your inclinations for the moment Mr Miller Isnt it a possibility Well yes d have to say that You testified the lever on the steering wheel was found pointing to drive while the car was actually in reverse Now ask whether in your opinion this lever could not have been jarred from one position to the other during the course of the drop It might but And this missing connection couldnt that have broken off when the car struck on the rocks No sir Not in my opinion If it had youd expect to see a part of the shearedoff cotter pin in one of the holes or scratches or marks or some bending to show where it had pulled out There wasnt a sign Excuse me but could ask the witness a question By all means Is it improper to ask if maybe this cotter pin mightnt have been defective only ask because had one bust off when was fixing my kids express wagon last week Thats a very good question sir Mr Miller will you answer the juror He asks Might not the cotter pin have been defective Maybe one in a million might be but Mr Miller would you be willing to stake your life on there being only one defective cotter pin in a million Think carefully now Remember our juror came across one just last week Well maybe not a million but Maybe one in a thousand Maybe one in a hundred Your Honor the question is argumentative object to counsel badgering the witness over this relatively minor point No point is minor when the lives of two innocent people Now gentlemen lets have no bickering Defense counsel is quite within his rights Mr Judson Overruled Thank you Your Honor Could ask another question now You certainly may Well what d like to know from Mr Miller is whether rigging a car like he says is a very complicated thing or could anyone do it Even a woman Tell the juror Mr Miller Well as said before its a very simple mechanical operation once it had been explained m sure you could do it yourself sir in a matter of minutes Thank you Thank you Mr Miller you live in Detroit do you not Yes sir Then will you please tell the jury who brought you out here from Detroit and employed you to make this investigation Objection Counsel has no right to question the integrity of the witness Your Honor since Mr Miller is employed by the same insurance companies who wrote the Tremayne policies and stand to save in excess of if murder rather than a simple accident can be proved If Your Honor please counsels remarks are out of order and prejudicial Sustained Jurors are instructed to disregard counsels statement With his knowledge of mechanics and her familiarity with the victims habits they plotted this murder Premeditated coldblooded murder But the plot did not stop there They planned every detail even beyond the crime itself Her breakdown when taken to the morgue to identify the bodies of Charles and Catherine Tremayne was a calculated bid for public sympathy However they made one seemingly insignificant mistake Diane Tremaynes suitcase was found in the garage apartment of Frank Jessup And then in desperation when confronted with the growing chain of evidence they sought to remedy the situation by getting married and playing the part of the two young lovers for the benefit of every tabloid scandal sheet in the country say the word love is profaned when applied to their unhealthy shameless passion And their marriage under these circumstances is a travesty could have stopped it ladies and gentlemen of the jury but did not Because in the last analysis knew it would damn them as utterly in your eyes as it did in mine must admit had a few anxious moments under the spell of the district attorneys brilliant eloquence For a while he almost had me believing the prosecution had a case Until you strip away the opulent phrases and get down to facts and then you discover he has no case He argues that Frank Jessups mechanical skill and knowledge was necessary to transform the automobile into a murder weapon Yet his own witness in answer to a question put by one of you ladies and gentlemen clearly stated that anyone without any special technical skill could have rigged that car in a few minutes in the way the district attorney imagines it was rigged But why linger on details when the district attorney has not presented one bit of conclusive evidence that the car ever was tampered with And here must remind you the burden of proof is on the prosecution If theres the slightest bit of doubt left in your minds then your verdict must be not guilty But the district attorney asked you to send these two young people to the gas chamber for yet another reason because theyre in love Ladies and gentlemen was shocked and surprised to hear Mr Judson blacken the characters of a man and woman whose only offense to society is that they happened to fall in love young girl wanted to leave a luxurious home elope with a hardworking ambitious war veteran and build a simple life together Is this profane and shameless leave the answer to you ladies and gentlemen If love is a crime Diane and Frank Jessup are guilty But this is the only crime that can be or has been proved against them Ladies and gentlemen of the jury have you reached a verdict We have Your Honor The clerk will please read the verdict People of the State of California v Frank Jessup and Diane Tremayne Jessup number We the jury in the above entitled action find the defendants not guilty Quiet please Order in the court Well we deserve a little

Yes Miss Diane Has he come in m sorry but Mr Barrett hasnt called in yet There must be some way of reaching him Its like told you this morning Mrs Jessup When he left yesterday he warned us not to expect him He was tired Now know he isnt at home and ve tried all the other numbers dare try Hello Shirley Mr Barrett Diane what brings you here thought youd seen enough of me to last a lifetime didnt know you were waiting Would you like a drink Perhaps a little sherry No thank you want to make a statement want someone to copy it down And want to sign it in the presence of witnesses Well mind telling me first what the statements about want it taken down just as say it You want to sign it and have it witnessed Very well Will you send someone in Shirley Anything to please a client especially such a lovely client Miss Preston Mrs Jessup would like to make a statement Will you take it down please Go ahead want to say that it was and alone who killed my stepmother Catherine Tremayne and Hold on now Never mind Miss Preston Just forget that Please stay here want it taken down every word Diane why go all through that again Youve been tried youve been acquitted Theres only one thing to do forget it Put it out of your mind completely as though it never happened You wouldnt listen before You wouldnt believe me But now you must listen Frank has been freed and can tell the truth Now may tell it and will she please take it down All right If you insist killed them both and Frank knew nothing about it That is he knew hated Catherine at least did then and he suspected me let him think that hed talked me out of it And then one day when he was working on her car got him to explain how the automatic transmission worked So he did show you how to fix the car No No But know how to get things out of people ask a lot of questions Its a habit of mine And people are so accustomed to it they answer without even thinking why want to know And you actually did it all by yourself On that Thursday Frank left right after Ito and Chiyo And then before Catherine came down It only took a few minutes just as that Mr Miller described at the trial At last a technical expert who knows his stuff Well do you feel better now that its off your conscience and It will never be off my conscience Mr Barrett But now that Frank has left me ve got nothing to live for cant believe hes really serious about leaving you No young man in his right mind is going to run away from a girl like you and a halfmillion dollar inheritance Hes gone to the girl he loved before he met me Shes taken him back think He didnt come home last night So now may please sign that and will you take me to the district attorneys Listen Diane once youve been tried for a crime and acquitted you can never be tried again or punished for it But m guilty It doesnt matter The law calls it double jeopardy You could sign that statement a dozen times in front of a dozen witnesses you could shout it from the housetops read it over the radio and there isnt a thing anyone can do about it No ll take that back There is one thing Theyd probably put you in an insane asylum Do you want that Keep it And so the Tremayne tragedy came to a happy ending after all With her acquittal Diane gets full control of the Tremayne estate and it is expected that she and her chauffeur husband will take a belated honeymoon trip abroad None of the principals was available to confirm this rumor However Well you win your bet Here Thanks for the use of the car You neednt have packed Ito could have brought your things over To
