Hello there Hello Have you already found a famous director for this Yes ve spoken to various people Big names Well Why do you ask No reason You like it right Yes Can you describe it to me in two words Its a story about a woman story about a girl Who Good day Hello dear Through a series of events Whats he want Whats with him today series of obscene events You dont dare tell me what she becomes prostitute naturally Were dealing with actual problems the Merlin law So the laws an excuse for her being a prostitute And you think shes right for it If we want Clara to do serious cinema then m behind her But on a serious level For example big film An art film film that would go abroad Clara ve thought about our discussion last night and weve hundreds of scripts in the drawer But ve thought of something really serious Really important Whats the subject Guess Joan of Arc What Dont tell me its a new idea theres about three versions How many Othellos and Juliet and Romeos have there been Theyre always good theyre classics It depends how you do it If you said The Lady of the Camellias it would be better its romantic Dont talk to me about prostitutes Joan of Arc is an enormous figure What do you want me to say cant see it we need another subject We need a love story For me the formula is sex politics and religion All together Unless Religions in there and politics too Do you know if in Joan of Arcs life well she was a woman too Youre a butcher How can you speak of Joan of Arc like that Shes such a noble character Who also died very young and well do the first part of her youth So no battles no trials and no formulas ve already got a director the film will get to Venice understand may be a butcher but know what say Youre both crazy To do a story like that you need a brain that neither nor you nor she has Sorry Clara but its the truth know my limits You just speculate you just want Clara to work without doing anything for her ll make her an actress wholl make people tremble Tremble Right Tremble So make your film and ll come and applaud But wont give you my money for it Goodbye But cant we find something else Leave it ll do it all on my own ll find the finance Good luck No wait Why cant we ever Clara Do you want to make films or pornography Well stop now Why do you say such things Because you make me say them offer you a unique opportunity One no other actress has film made for you Made by me With my own blood Thats what fear dont want you to get into a mess because of me Dont want what Dont you trust me ll do it all on my own m even tempted to direct it With you feel could If theres something better to do what do you suggest Lets go to the movies if we get bored we can go for a swim In this rain Its great d rather go to the movies Whoever loves me will follow me Whos making you go to the Lido Theyve got good films in the afternoon too Sure Small film sometimes can have notable actors Michele we made Nardo come over for the festival and now it seem shes obsessed with cinema know You must be if you want to see la Manni in Joan of Arc ve never seen her on the screen and this is her first serious film m going m going to the projection room To check on the screening m nervous wont wish anything for your husband But for you Clara hope for the best Thank you Seltzer sir Yes Here you are Dont tell me to be quiet Go Joan What a bore Lets go for a swim Yes Come Marisa Et voila Well done You will leave with three soldiers free Orleans from the English siege The Dolphin will be King Shall we go Its no good want to see it all theres

you can tell Its not true knew her After Falconetti and Bergman how can she The presumption The presumption didnt like it Good evening Have you seen Clara She left during the film That was a while ago Thank you San Marco No It was a brave attempt Not good but brave You think the same as the others If youd listened to my advice Your advice would be in a mess No you wouldnt d already seen it but seeing it again it was worse Thank you for not talking about the film started crying like that in front of you who hardly know didnt say anything because didnt know what to say m not from your world and dont know what this means for you Now therell be the reviews the discussions You left halfway through too eh That means nothing You can go to a movie even if youre not interested in cinema went to the film just for you Actually m in Venice exclusively for you At least ve made you smile When can see you again leave immediately tonight In Rome then dont know m in such despair dont understand anything Thanks anyway Excuse me What pigs All of them If get my hands on them You were wrong we should have stayed in Venice Please dont understand m going crazy Why do you take it so hard Why cant you see beyond a single projection ve seen more than beyond Ah yes Who knows what you saw We got it all wrong Gianni Your fault my fault dont know Certainly more mine than yours For months weve been working on this adventure You hurled me into it without giving me time to reflect Thats how you work So so here we are Like two strangers Worse Because ones often more sincere with a stranger ve always let you persuade me When you told me to come to Rome when you married me when you made me do this film ve always done everything you wanted Everything What are you saying Maybe never thought about the consequences Or ignored them to avoid being scared As m scared every time see myself on screen have to repeat to myself ten times a minute Its me me Come on You know were talking about us Gianni Also when think of you have to repeat to myself Its me me Why did you marry me You knew didnt love you even if never had the courage to tell you Why are you saying these things wish they werent true but they are Youve always known it And dont know how you can be happy about it Like youre happy about the film which went badly This way cant work anymore and have to stay home all day waiting for you But my love why do we have to say stupid degrading things to each other Youve had a big disappointment and suddenly everything seems a failure Our love too Youve been happy with me No Gianni no Come in Mineral water sir Is the director here Hes in the hall Should call him No ll go Whats this story about you changing the programme tomorrow cant afford to ruin myself with your film in high season Sorry signor Franchi m not cheating you Youre not changing the film have to d be better off paying a fine d be better off showing anything else dont you see Well see m going to the ministry Remember bills worth And another million on the th Dont worry renew them m not worried at all m just telling you wont renew them Why not was happy to help you and d be happy to stay in the affair if there was an affair But it doesnt seem a question of recuperating the money with delay The question now is that the money wont be recuperated at all You must understand that cant continue Wait why worry Theres the second run What second run Youve got a curious way of thinking Why Its only two hours to Monte Carlo we can eat there need to go home for lunch You think those who work in cinema live a completely different life Maybe all together in Cinecitta Maybe m ruining all your plans single man always travelling going to Rome for a while Whats better than an adventure with a film person You cant think much of me Quite the opposite If asked you to stop its because its a place like a lot place where if two people were talking here theyd end up understanding each other And instead Since Venice ve thought only of you But you havent thought about me Thats exactly why said you have a curious idea Do you think a situation like this is easy for me ve never been in this situation before And now were both in it why hide it Remember the day we met in Venice Just a touch of hands in the middle of a crowd and between us something happened Dont deny it Clara Can you deny it Dont ruin everything told you you dont understand Let go of me So lets go back to the city Where do you want me to take you dont know Anywhere The centre Fine Did you send those flowers Were sending them now

wont be waking up for at least hours right doctor Yes Anyway Clara well take care of the rest Listen Clara you heard the doctor Gianni is out of danger Lets not think about it anymore Lets just say

you leave wouldnt want to compromise you See you Clara Farewell Anything new lady came Should still be here Thank you Clara Good evening Sorry for coming at this time needed to talk to someone not be alone and youre the only person Whats happened This morning was the happiest woman in the world and now finally had the courage to leave that house where never found myself Where everything felt false where felt false Gianni and got married like in the movies It was all a mistake But with Nardo for the first time in a long time fooled myself into feeling alive in flesh and bone kidded myself When he realized for me it was serious you cant imagine Lodi saw in his face a fear that was tender If it hadnt been so horrible it wouldve been ridiculous who thought of eternal love and he who only wanted an adventure with an actress And he had it So here am thought about leaving for Milan with my mother But ll tell her to go alone m not myself anymore with my family Last time went home it was a disaster Whens that merchandise arriving It left on the th Postpaid Of course already have too many expenses Isnt that the actress In the movies Whats her name dont know dont know her The packaging cant be like last time Of course Lodi m desperate ve nothing now at At times like this you need courage to throw yourself into work Clara Have you some project some film in view Its about this that wanted to talk to you Are you sure cinema is the work for me Frankly wouldnt know Would you like anything Thank you This will sound strange but youve had things too easy You succeeded almost without working Probably its not your fault You had mediocre directors unsuitable stories you learned nothing Youve never seen the better aspects of Italian cinema Clara youre beautiful and till now theyve done nothing but photograph your beauty Maybe you cant do more than that or maybe you can discover as an actress the meaning of your life but you havent tried yet neither for others or yourself How does one try Have you ever thought about what being a serious actress means Have you ever asked yourself what makes great actors successful Do you know all the suffering theyve had to overcome Long years of study often obscure the hopes and disappointments Up until now cinema has given you a superficial fame Its put you in a false world where you say you feel empty One can say you havent even started becoming an actress So you advise me to begin studying to become an actress a serious actress Its worth a try for somebody like me Its always worth a try What took you so long The undersecretary kept me So youre going to Paris with the Commission Any news Nothings been decided yet Look Isnt that la Manni Listen didnt you tell me she left Did you know What That she was back If
