cold world and laid in the filth of a manger when King Herod massacred infants Christmas has some bad memories too To truly appreciate the beauty of Christmas you must understand its ugliness Sin is the beating heart of Christmas pain and war Fear and sickness death and famine American ldol and internet pornography Thomas Guthrie wrote Who is the murderess that takes his life Sin Who is the sorceress that first deceives and then damns his soul Sin Who is it that brings old men grey hair with sorrow to the grave Sin Sin is the reason that our Savior Jesus Christ was born wont say a word
