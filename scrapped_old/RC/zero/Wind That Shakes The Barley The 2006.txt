Irish Delegates who signed the treaty The new state will remain within the British Empire as a dominion As a dominion Members of the new Parliament will swear an oath of allegiance to You see this Splendid news says the King What kind of peace can you have with a king Theyre in the wrong dont have any fecking king Feck off What No way No way Is this what we fought for is it Is this what we fought for is it betrayal of Look at this boy Its all true Lmmediate and terrible war Those were the exact words The threat promised by the British Cabinet if we didnt ratify this treaty Lloyd George Churchill Chamberlain Birkenhead Hamar Greenwood bunch of more vicious bastards in the one room you cant imagine They have just watched million men women and children die in the Great War You think theyll give a damn about a few thousand dead Republicans Bluffing Theyre in a dirty war and they cant win Oh see Fair enough agree Theyre not going to lose face in America And the rest of the world Theyre not going to risk that Its costing them a day Theyve a lot more after that dont you worry Lads youre not hearing what Teddys saying Lmmediate and terrible war Think about it Weve rifles in the country Hows that going to work for us Huh Lads we have freedom within our grasp Were that close Its just one inch but its still out of reach And if we stop now we will never again regain the power that can feel in this room can sense it in this room today And if we stop short now never in our lifetime will we see that energy again Ever So m begging each and every one of you to just go that inch We cannot stop until weve complete freedom from Britain Remember this Remember this Each one of us swore an oath of allegiance to the Irish Parliament of This treaty flies in the face of it It insults it by asking us to swear another oath to the King that were trying to get out An oath And maybe if was a politician like yourselves could say whatever want but m not m a Republican And the only question want you to answer is are you men of your word Do you expect me to answer that Are you a Republican Of course m a Republican need to say something in answer Bloody liar Absent faces But theyre still present in here Its Kevin Johnny Colum murdered in the barracks Theres Benny shot in the back while cutting turf Aidan tortured and then hung Micheail Jesus could go on all day but we cant forget Micheail He was beaten to a pulp in front of his mother And cannot will not spit on the graves of our dead martyrs by swearing an oath of allegiance to the British Crown If you really want to desecrate the graves of those boys if you want to insult their memories you go ahead and reject this treaty Because this is what they died for And because a lot of you are too stubborn Youre too stubborn Youre too stubborn to Talk about Michael Collins Michael Collins is a hero He went down there to London He was seduced by the wining and dining He did not negotiate a proper treaty Bloody surrender More of a surrender than what the British are doing Think of the concessions theyve made Lloyd George is in a coalition with diehard Tories As far as theyre concerned Ireland is this tiny dot in a much bigger picture Do you seriously think theyd let him give the green light to nationalists in India and in Africa and the whole fucking empire by giving us complete independence It was never going to happen that way and you all know it If we ratify this treaty we will destroy the two most precious gifts that we won with this last election One being a mandate for complete freedom not a compromised freedom The second being a Democratic programme in which is enshrined the priority the public welfare over private welfare This treaty will copperfasten the hold of the powerful over the poor because there will be a governor general wholl have our puppet parliament on a leash Itll be business as usual with workers tied to a shift at a factory and fellas begging for jobs Its the partition of the country The alienation the abandonment of our brothers in the top of this country You say the Brits are leaving Theyre going miles up the road Men women and children being burned out of their homes Its true boy Its true My cousins are on the streets of Belfast Burned from their homes by Loyalists Theres refugees all over Dublin You know what this treaty means for them Instead of sectarian gangs theyll now face those same thugs armed and uniformed by the British state Read the treaty Sinead Theres no certainty Well have a divided Ireland There is certainty Read the treaty Read the treaty There is certainty Dan My dad was a nawy He worked in London digging holes for tuppence hapenny until it killed him had two sisters never got to know because they died in infancy for want of a doctor Now what signed up to when got involved in this was part Here have a piece of paper here Its from the Democratic Programme of the First Dail Its a short quote wont keep you m going to read this out to you The nations sovereignty extends not only to all the men and women of the nation but to all its material possessions the nations soil and all its resources All the wealth and all the wealthproducing processes within the nation That means all of us in this country own every bit of this country And thats what we all signed up to when we voted for the Dail Right If we pursue this every child in this country will have an equal chance If we dont they wont have a chance in hell If we ratify this treaty all were changing is the accents of the powerful and the colour of the flag Thats not true Thats not true Thanks be to God it was a great day to see the back of them Jesus Christ thought d never see the day You can say that again Not before time Exactly Good riddance to them Oneway ticket now lads Have a safe journey and God bless all of you Bugger off Paddy And ll see you in hell Eyes to your front soldier Look at them Not a gun between them Handed them all over to the

live in London will be seized and divided up against landless workers and small farmers All industry and agriculture will be controlled by the state for the workers and farmers benefit Not content with stealing your savings theyll be nationalising the apostles next Dear brethren we have an opportunity for the first time in generations in this country for peace and prosperity We have that opportunity without English soldiers marching in our streets and outside our churches on a Sunday morning We have that opportunity because we have signed a treaty treaty of peace Quiet Let me remind those of you who have forgotten of the pastoral letter signed by Cardinal Logue and other bishops AntiTreatyite irregulars have and quote Wrecked Ireland from end to end And all those who participate in such crimes are guilty of the gravest sins and may not be absolved in confession nor admitted to Holy Communion In other words excommunication This opinion of the treaty is not just the opinion of the Catholic Church it is the opinion of other churches And it is the opinion of every newspaper up and down and the length and breadth of this country But most importantly this treaty was ratified overwhelmingly ratified by the people in their democratic expression in the June election Can you tell me how can there be a fair election in this country when the most powerful country in the world threatens war This is not the will of the people It is the fear of the people How dare you talk to me in the house of God Silence Damien Donovan you are a disgrace to the memory of your parents Go The Free State Constitution was only printed the morning of the election so nobody had time to read it This is not the marketplace Sit down shut up or get out And once again the Catholic Church with honourable exception sides with the rich Get out Get out thought those days were done Damien Damien Please Come on boy want a word What are you doing Youre fighting with the priest Is it not bad

shame of it What has our father got to do with this Theres one in four people out of work in this country have seen children and families starving Do we expect them to head off to New York and London
