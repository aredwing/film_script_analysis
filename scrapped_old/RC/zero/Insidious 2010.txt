Renai is real ve seen it for myself came today because last night had a dream about this place was in this house but it was late at night was afraid went into your bedroom but you were both asleep knew was asleep in the dream but could feel that someone was awake in the house went into Daltons room There was something in there with him It was standing there in the corner asked it Who are you And it said it was a visitor said What do you want It Said Dalton can still hear that voice What What its here What Jesus Oh my God Okay Hes okay Please Please help him Please know someone who can help if youre willing to ask m Specs This is Tucker m Renai Hi Hi You must be Josh Yeah Hi That wasnt psychic Elise already told me your name so Where is Elise She sent us ahead to do some preliminary tests Helps weed out the nut jobs What is that Its a Trifield meter Measures fields and the natural electromagnetic environment Yeah sometimes old wiring can leak into the atmosphere It causes hallucinations changes in energy Its a little more important than that but whatever The tech stuffs not really relevant to you guys anyway Its all very relevant actually What Starfleet Series One Its hard to find Should have kept it in its box This device measures changes in light make all this equipment myself you know Its impressive Thanks Its not that hard if you know what youre doing Yeah that ones basically a modified toy m gonna need some time alone to concentrate This field is Look the body is made up of energy Where does that energy go when we die We can call Elise Now wasnt sure the doorbell was working m sorry Thats fine Come on in Thank you Mrs Rainier No Mrs Rainier is my mother Just call me Elise m Josh knew that Youve grown since last saw you Since you last saw me Your mother and have been friends a long time Well hello This is my wife Renai How do you do Hi thank you for coming Thank you for having me Can we get you anything Elise No m fine thank you so much We took Trifield and readings of the whole house all the wiring alarm clocks radios toasters record player fuse box nothing went off the charts except for the And the previous home Tucker hadnt monitored that yet You know what Dont even sweat it ll make myself available ll get on that this afternoon Yeah but ll have to come too because whos going to operate the equipment Well strictly could do it without Yeah but need to oversee Yeah but its not Thats fine gentlemen dont think bad wiring is the problem here May walk through the house Sure of course Thank you Your other children are with Lorraine right Yeah they are Steven do you have your sketchbook Yes Yes do Good Cause were gonna need it What do you need that for She tells me what she sees and draw it Its the most important part of her process Thats debatable its not debatable It is but whatever Leave the light off Hey Dalton You are a very handsome boy Your mom and dad are here so dont you worry What What The face What Blood red face Black Black arms Black legs Black body Slow down His feet are black His legs are black Slow down What is it Oh my God And pitch black eyes Theyre like two dark holes He has hooves for feet What And long spidery fingernails Elise whats Hey what is that m not sure if youre ready to hear this yet but unfortunately cant waste any time easing you into it want you to know this is what believe and it may contradict a previous medical diagnosis but You called me here and m taking that as an acceptance of my readings Yes Yes go on Your son isnt in a coma Falling off a ladder had nothing to do with this His physical bodys here But his spiritual body is not And the reason these disturbances they followed you to a new home is because its not the house thats haunted Its your son dont understand Have you ever heard of astral projection Yes Its out of body experience or something like to call them travelers You see these are people with the ability to leave their physical body and to travel to different places in astral form Now Dalton he is a very accomplished astral projector Hes been doing it in his sleep for a long time He has been since he was very young And hes unafraid because he thinks theyre dreams And its that very lack of fear that has led him to travel too far And to become lost Lost Lost where In a place that call the Further What What does that mean The Further is a world far beyond our own yet its all around us a place without time as we know it Its a dark realm filled with the tortured souls of the dead a place not meant for the living Thats where Dalton is And the problem is that with his astral body gone hes just left us with a physical body an empty vessel And there are entities that know this because they can smell it Thats why theyre gathered around him Are these the things that ve been seeing Theyre all trying to get inside of his physical body simply because they They crave life the chance to live again But there are other entities who are malevolent and have a more insidious agenda And then theres this demon who seeks Daltons body for one reason to cause pain to others He is so desperate to possess Dalton and hes the closest of all the entities to getting inside of him What do you mean the closest Because these entities they cant just walk into the bodies of the living anytime they please To cross over from their realm it takes time It takes energy But the longer that Daltons astral body is kept away from his physical body the weaker the link gets The easier it is to possess him Is there anything we can do to bring Dalton back Theres something we could try Its a little unorthodox But would need your complete trust No no no m sorry this has gone too far What No please Josh You said you would give her a chance have given her a chance honey but cant have somebody coming into our home and telling us the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul has floated off somewhere in another dimension Were gonna bring her all the way here and not even consider what shes saying did this to make sure you could feel at ease And if it helped great ve listened to the dog and pony show have seen the drawings But to bring Dalton into it no But why is our son still in a coma Why cant the doctors tell us what is wrong with him How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here Dont you see Renai You want to believe Anybody would You dont believe me You dont believe me moved houses for you What do you mean dont believe you m on your side here But this this is dangerous and exploitative You guys come into the home of a seriously ill child and you make some tenuous connection between him and the images my wife is seeing and voil Tears validate your power and thank you very much that will be please Thank you for coming Please Please Thank you No really understand Please Thank you for your hospitality Good luck Oh Jesus Sorry to waste your time Where are you buddy Did you go somewhere No No youre right here You are right here Can you hear me know you can hear me but you gotta show me okay buddy You gotta show me that you can hear me Okay Whats most important is that you realize no two attempts are the same m going to be completely honest with you about the results If theres no dialogue established m gonna tell you These still cameras are rigged to pick up any changes in the atmosphere both electrical or temperaturewise Dont be alarmed if they go off Youre gonna see a lot of confusing things things you dont understand But do not question them and do not speak in any way want you to know whatever say when m in tune is going to be at a very low volume You wont hear any of it But Stevens gonna write it down Hes going repeat it for you Okay Dim the lights please We are calling out to you Dalton Tell us youre safe Tell us where you are Tell us youre safe Tell us where you are Dalton Can you hear us Answer us Whos there Dalton its your mother and father Weve been searching for you Where

cameras Around the clock We got nothing But did find this on the video Take a look Take a look You see that went through it Frame by frame by frame Oh my God Whos that ll get it Hi Lorraine Mom what are you doing here asked your mother to come over called her immediately after the session Why Theres something we must talk about Lorraine have a seat Go on Tell him Tell me what Mom The reason knew to call Elise in this situation the reason know her so well is because called her myself once years ago to help you What are you talking about Mom Its no accident that your son is a gifted traveler The ability was handed down to him By his father Me No dont do cant do that When you were about eight you suffered night terrors these awful fits of pure fear You were terrified of an old woman you said used to come visit you at night dismissed your stories told you to grow up And then saw her for myself At first thought it was a camera problem And then saw her again In each photo she got closer and closer and closer to you Finally was so frightened found Elise Do you remember any of this honey do you No dont Suppressing your memory and your ability to astral project was the only way to stop her from getting into you But in the back of your mind youre still afraid to have your picture taken arent you kept those photos hidden from you ever since advised Lorraine to hide them to stop taking your picture to just let you forget Who is she parasite She befriended your astral body and then drew you out into the Further just as Dalton has been drawn out m so sorry Josh didnt want to make you remember all this do it for the sake of your son Your son is out there And you are the only one that can bring him back And with what we saw tonight would say he doesnt have much time left to wait for you Okay Youve always been stronger than me You can do this love you love you Please come back Remember why youre traveling and keep one foot in this world Do not draw attention to yourself If they realize you are not one of them they will come for your physical body in this world Ready Yeah dont know what m ready for but Okay Close your eyes Josh take a deep breath and relax With each breath let the life around you fade into the background Just listen to the ticking of the metronome Focus on the spot in the center of your forehead The universe is deathless It is deathless because having no finite self it stays infinite sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead of himself Its useless have no idea what m doing Now youre outside Let my voice be your guide Keep a steady stride Into the Further you go Dalton Hes in Dalton Hello Hello Wait Hello Hello Hello m looking for my son Dalton Dalton Dalton Wheres my son Tell me where my son is Please Whats happening to him
