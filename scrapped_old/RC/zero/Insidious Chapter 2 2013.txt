have to Make him forget One morning Dalton just wouldnt wake up We took him to the best doctors we could find but none of them had any idea Eventually we just took him home still in his coma Then things started happening around the house Unexplained things got so freaked out we moved But they kept happening And you believe that there was some sort of supernatural force at work When did you hire the services of the deceased Elise Rainier When we ran out of places to go It says in your statement Mrs Lambert that last night at approximately pm Elise put your husband into a state of hypnosis She did this as part of a ritual that she believed would allow him to project his unconscious into a Uh m sorry cant read my own handwriting Into a spirit realm where he could locate your son and bring him back to consciousness Now did you really believe that would help had to Whatever she did it worked Dalton woke up And what happened after your son woke up Josh Josh where are you Josh Renai m right here Renai What Oh no no no Elise Elise Mom get Dalton out of here Call an ambulance No no no Elise Oh no No no What Why are you looking at me like that You think did this Did you
