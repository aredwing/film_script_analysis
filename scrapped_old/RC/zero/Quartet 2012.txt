voice and mean that sincerely dont think you realise it Reggie but people still talk about your Celeste Aida four years ago and your Ave Maria two years ago For what its worth when heard you sing Nessun Dorma at the gala last year all thought was Eat your heart out Pavarotti Reggie know you dont think much of me but with this one concert we could get enough money to keep this place going for the rest of the year Or possibly even the next Its true You could help save Beecham House Reginald But have an important meeting now Do excuse me Titwillow Oh shut up For sakes shut up And you could persuade Jean to sing Its only one gala Reggie Why dont the three of us ask her out to dinner Well done Reggie Oh Reggie Thank you Excellent No ll uh ll write her a little note Cissy and perhaps you will be good enough to deliver it Yes Sorry Just two favours Exactly what do you propose The Swan restaurant Just the four of us Cissy Reggie and me If we could convince Jean to sing at the gala were
