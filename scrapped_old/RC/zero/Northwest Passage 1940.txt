sloops are anchored ahead just beyond the point Now with their lookouts we wont get by unnoticed We can wipe them out Give us a chance No no Somebody would be sure to get away and announce our coming

world as great warriors Theyve come a long journey from their homes in the mohawk valley and we their friends thought they had come to raise their hatchets for the great king their father We trusted them to find the frenchs hiding place They returned saying theyd seen nothing yet three french war boats were in the way enough to kill us all It is impossible to make war if you are dead Tell them that Speaking mohawk Speaking mohawk He say their father sir william johnson understand there is time make war and time not make war This is not time make war Ohh Well now we understand why sir william johnson sent our brothers the mohawks to join us He sent them to drink our rum eat our food and do nothing Since they wont obey orders they must return to crown point If they tell the real reason they came back general amherst might have them shot so theyll say they became sick It may seem remarkable that all of the mohawks became sick They may be called old women for doing so Better to be called old women than to be shot They will return at once by land Les move Get their belongings from the boat m going to see what those sloops are doing Them mohawks had pelts half as good as a weasel theyd be worth shooting d burn them alive Injuns is peculiar people You cant judge them like white folks Those mohawks are snakes Hey put that down Whas going on here Captain you cant do that Cant What cant i These red skunks stole the powder out of the boat Blow his head off Step aside Let this indian through wont back down for that dirty skunk Follow orders Go jump in the lake You cant throw us orders Weve got more brains than you You dirty provincial Dirty provincials Thas what you think You and your highlanders and your black irish You aint rangers Your brassbutton soldiers filled up with poisoned skunk water and sawdust Major we needed that powder If captain williams hadnt interfered none of this wouldve happened You cant take liberties with an indian No matter how these indians behave youve got to keep them friendly Weve got enough unfriendly ones But thas beside the point You didnt maintain discipline The moment disciplines gone everythings gone Major i thought captain butterfield youre going back Report to general amherst that you got sick too Youre sick and so is every man with a powder burn who goes back with you Captain williams captain williams im putting you in charge of all these sick men Youll start back at once Major id like to say a word Say it Counting the mohawks youre sending back men Thas of your command You cant afford to lose that many major Couldnt you reconsider those orders can still see out of one eye Captain williams youre going back because youre in no condition to go on but most of you are going back because you cant maintain discipline d make this expedition with men Yes with men d do more with those than i could with who didnt obey orders All the men in this detachment are rangers Do you understand Theyre not englishmen or highlanders or irishmen Theyre rangers And if i find two men leading together as americans or englishmen by heavens ill send them back if were within feet of where were going Dismissed Injured men fall in there The rest of us will push on We cant risk being bottled up in a little stream Fall in Follow me to the boats Any orders sir Have them cover the boats well Yes sir Well captain

where we wanted to go major dont have to tell you who the abanochis are Most of you have lost folks and friends in indian raids since Youll find their scalps at st Francis Some of you men fought in the battle on snowshoes last year Ask joe turner He was there Hell tell you They captured lieutenants crofton and phillips and other rangers Lieutenant croftons brother is here He can tell you what happened to them Yes major can tell you Phillips had a strip of skin torn upward from his stomach They hung him from a tree while still alive They chopped his men up with hatchets and threw the pieces into the pine They tore my brothers arms out of him They chopped the ends of his ribs away from his backbone and pried them out through his skin one by one Thas what happened to crofton and phillips But they were soldiers Tey had to take their chances But your folks on the border farms they werent fighting anybody They were clearing woods and plowing and raising children trying to make a home of it And then one night abanochi tomahawks at the door If it was over quick they were lucky Now if theres any man here who doesnt want to follow me against these indians he can step out now Destroy that

your idea Well sir its pretty hard to drive hungry men but i think wed be better off if we stick together Men jeer Now wait a minute agree with ogden Were all pretty hungry but a hungry man can go on
