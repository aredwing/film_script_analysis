just like they rode in the pioneer days Its unbelievable Sir Jellystone is special Okay Its turning years old this very year Why its a landmark would never let it be closed down Well uh you actually

Yogi do regret calling it that now know m always saying Stay away from the campers This is different Jellystone is in real trouble If dont raise in a week this parks getting rezoned Rezoned What does that mean It means the park wont be a park anymore The city will use this land for something else So we have got to do everything we can to help save it Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy But they do leave here happy Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special People come here for that Its like catching a foul ball at a baseball game Nope Its like getting your food stolen at a baseball game Come on Yogi Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear You know to forage for food to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little or a lot If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldnt have given me such a good thoughtcooker sir cant help it if my melon is full of smart juice Yogi your melon is hurting this park There are repercussions to stealing peoples picnic baskets Not in my experience sir On the other hand Ranger Smith mind if borrow the dilla Its an emergency Somebody parked without parking decals Jones would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead Let me deal with the visitors until youve had more experience Sorry sir Guess thats just the Eagle Scout in me you know Always wanting to be in control be a leader Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies right merit badge in first aid is the only supply need sir Right

Great You know this really is a peaceful place Its something isnt it pretty much grew up here My father was a ranger when was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state mean it was a park you know Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams hiked on the trails It was really something This is really good Anyway dont know Maybe its my fault spent so many years learning everything could about the park so d be a better ranger Maybe instead should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here You know change the name to Extreme

of entertainment Got a little of everything Music stunts magic And jump over Boo Boo at the end No you dont want to try it dont care hate to interrupt but youre not gonna waterski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers okay If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low stay away from people Think you can do that for me You have my word Mr Ranger will be seen but not heard Or seen Fine Huh You guys done with that Spam Get out of here Okay Sheesh Hey Whats this Seasons pass applications Unfortunately not a lot of takers on those Fifty bucks for an entire year Including camping fees Thats a bargain If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year Maybe Yogi was on to something You said the park was turning right Right Well a big event could really pull people in Yeah youre right We could have like a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase Or Fireworks Yes Exactly Why didnt think of that We could host a big centennial festival People always show up for fireworks If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open Right Lets get the word out think can help with that That is great How did we pay for it We didnt It was some fastfood restaurant but rearranged the letters right before the plane took off Youre very cool Rachel Johnson Youre pretty cool yourself do have my own kind

dues Excuse me What He has to pay his dues Ha Ha ha Nobody pays dues anymore You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything Thats what ve been saying Yeah Buddy if it was up to me you

me with that Make sure it doesnt succeed Wait you mean like sabotage it No Oh no no no No want you to be head ranger It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival But
