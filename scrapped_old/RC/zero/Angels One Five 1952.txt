whether you get shot down or not All m interested in is the efficiency of the squadrons under my command The squadron is a team Each member must have complete confidence in every other in attack or defense It takes quite a time to build such a team And m not going to jeopardize one of the finest squadrons in fighter command just so that you can poop off your guns Is that clear Yes sir Good Now suggest that you get along and report to the Operations Room If youve got any sense and you keep your eyes and ears open you could learn a lot If had my way all pilots would do a spell in there Thank

hour of the night but its the only time can be sure of getting all my squadron commanders on the ground together Oh well thats quite all right sir Well gentlemen was over at Group this afternoon and thought perhaps you might like to know what the had to say about the way things are going and are likely to go Oh thank you sir Yes well you keep your thanks until after youve heard what hes said Richard Very briefly intelligence believes that the Jerries have just been probing so far Testing our defenses At any moment now the real shenanigan may start ve often wondered why the muchboosted Luftwaffe hasnt put up a better show For the old reason Bill The strong always underestimate the weak But were not as weak as all that sir Do you know how many squadrons there are in Fighter Command John About Yes to defend the whole country On the same basis the Jerries have squadrons of bombers and of fighters from Brest and Amsterdam alone Makes you think doesnt it It makes me pray Yes well youll be wasting your prayers but for things Weve got better aircraft better pilots and perhaps most important of all we have radio location and ground control Thats where Peter and his boys in the Hole come in Hear hear Any idea what the next move of the Jerry will be sir Yes m coming to that You can bet your shirts that hes got all our Ops Rooms and Sector Stations neatly ringed on his maps If he can flatten our fighter defences then all the rest of it is a piece of cake to him invasion and all So youd better get your Emergency Ops Room on the top line right away Soss Yes sir Meaning that we can expect some unwelcome visitors any time now Exactly Peter Oh yes And talking of visitors much as regret it think we shall have to curtail our social activities here dont like risking wives

clear and precise conclusions about things All good doctors need to do that Yes know but you wouldnt be so good as a Indeed Why not There you go Quite relentless arent you dont know why just have a feeling youd be a bit too determined if you know what mean No bedside manner Yes if you like Anyway its much more comfortable to be a specialist Who wants to be dragged out of bed at all hours of the night Is that some more of your immoral advice Very wicked arent dont think so Oh Betty Yes Would you come out with me one evening Of course would d love to Alone mean Darling old Septic dont go around chained to a chaperone you know We could go over to Maidstone and have dinner just the two of us Oh d adore that When Well not just for a bit maybe Oh Why not Well you see ll need to settle

over your face Did you report to intelligence m sorry sir In the excitement must have forgotten This is an operational squadron not a flying circus Weve no time for personal jamborees Weve got a job to do realise that sir Perhaps you also realise that you left your radio on transmit the whole time you were in the air did sir Yes you the textbook pilot who knows all the answers You jammed the channel so that Operations couldnt speak to any pilot on your frequency Pilots returning from a grueling action shot up short of juice not even knowing that their base had been bombed How did you know it was me sir Cause your aircraft was the only one in practice flight with a serviceable radio Thank God those that got back landed safely Otherwise d run you off the station with my own hands Lets face it Baird You may know the training manuals backwards by heart But until youve had operational experience you arent worth your rations to this squadron It shant happen again sir Once is too often
