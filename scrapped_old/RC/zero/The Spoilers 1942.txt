glennister doesnt know what happened to the safe Tell the lovely lady that were quite aware of whats going on Roy has worked out what consider a very sensible plan How does Mr glennister look when hes acting brilliant Little bubbles come out of my mouth and smoke You oughta know that Before we start the shooting war we should wait for the court case If Stillman doesnt restore the mine its up to me to go to Seattle to a higher court Thatll cost money Ten thousand more d say Well manage to raise it You dont think theyll let you take money from the safe Possibly But we cant say yes or no till after the hearing in court My guess is theyll toss it all into the bay And what floats is yours Come on Oex Well if you ask me that Judge Stillmans alright Flapjack got his claim back quickly It sure surprised me If we want our seats we better get in before court takes up again So the judge says m givin this mine back to who it belongs to And thats me Hes a judge that is a judge The old boy aimed

line our pokes Itll be months before Wheaton gets back Whats funny about that baby Nothing My were a jolly crew arent we Careful now Helen Its so much more fun making money the way we do instead of slaving for it like miners m not sure like your attitude Youve got a distorted viewpoint Brought about by what is know as the miracle of love Tell us about what a nice community it was before we came and spoiled it Make it sound as sloppy as you want But thats what we are a cheap lot of spoilers Now thats enough Helen No more of this sentimental taffy But suppose the miners do revolt They blew out the front of the bank They could do the same to the jail and free glennister before the trial Perhaps you wont have to bring him to trial What do you mean Thatd be carrying things a bit too far Weve never had to resort to anything like like murder What do you want here Picking a nice time to leave town Why shouldnt go now have things want to get in Seattle You paid Captain Toombs triple fare for passage on a leaky old freighter Who told you that Most men who patronize my place are my friends Captain Toombs is one of them Ooes that tell you anything fail to see why it should If wanted him to
