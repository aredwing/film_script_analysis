right to choose your own medical care but that is interpreted as medical care that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration Regarding the the court is highly disturbed by its bullying tactics and direct interference with a drug whose own agency has found to be nontoxic The was formed to protect people not prevent them from getting help The law doesnt seem to make much common sense sometimes And if a person has been found to be terminally ill they ought to be able to take just about anything they feel will help but thats not the law Mr Woodroof m moved to compassion by your
