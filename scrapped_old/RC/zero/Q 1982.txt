Aztecs identified flayed skin with the new garments Young vegetation Let me get this straight Youre talking about human sacrifice now Willing sacrifice They give themselves to the God willingly ritual was performed using various objects to indicate cosmic events Collimating in blood sacrifice to strengthen the forces of nature Performed by the high priest And the victims you might call them a skin after theyre skinned the high priest puts the skin upon himself wearing it as like a garment Of course were talking about the ancient Aztecs civilization not this north American culture we see here understand Mexico The gods they prayed to One God Quetzalcoatl the feathered flying serpent can give you some interesting books on that subject Well good need something to put me to sleep at night Now if you think thats what happened here then this case wasnt murder What do you call it Suicide possibly Oh your Mr Polly mightve been coerced in one way or another But you must remember blood must be giving willingly for the God to appreciate it He must giveth himself otherwise the ritual is meaningless Well they came to this museum think thats very certain He met someone He was engaged in conversation Maybe they had a couple of drinks And they went back to his hotel room and they did the deed find it difficult to phantom why a guy with a wife and two kids and tenure at a university would suddenly decide to give up his life without even a chance to think about it You see gave himself a chance Why else did he come to the city Was there any other reason he should be here Well thats what were trying to determine You know thats an interesting angle No vacation No research Just some guy flies thousand of Miles to New York City to give his life on a sacrificial alter Maybe should take those books of yours m not going to be able to sleep either if you keep looking at those horrible pictures You dont think anything like that serpent ever really existed do you Sure it did And the Aztecs killed for it Wouldnt be the first time in history that a monster was mistaken for a God And you have to figure out which it was monster or a God Some detective You dont believe in any of this stuff do you Why dont you turn off the lights In a minute Guess thats why have to kill it If can kill its not a God Its a good old fashion monster better take my birth control pill God Maybe its a bird huh Joanie Yes Come on open up Oh okay Lock it Mustve been some wild party So where were you all night What happened Did you get mugged Well hope you didnt go on the job appointment looking like

two The human sacrifice theory huh Well listen The donors heart is ritually removed be presented to the gods Sure sounds like it doesnt it Luckily all we have to do nowadays is take the wafer and drink the wine Thats what call being civilized Personally trust that curator or anybody else we talked to over there think theyre all a bunch of freaks And one of those freaks is probably the person

particularly interested in is anyone who has any medical background You know someone with some expertise with surgical tools Okay captain Yeah we all love you Shepard So you dont think its a lot of baloney No think there was basis in fact See there was some kind of giant bird creature And it would appear again in nature But doubt if new yorkers would mistaken it as a God Why not If they come to fear it enough What else is God but an invisible force that we fear For centuries weve tried to make it into our image Give God two legs pair of hands lips eyes Perhaps its only our vanity mean were only living in one small second of time in history of man kind Look at the tablets of ancient Egypt The Babylonians go all the way back The figure of that serpent keeps turning up all the time The flying serpent in places as far away as Egypt Mexico and deep in the interior of China You know perhaps at one time the whole world was covered with these kinds of birds And then they became extinct
