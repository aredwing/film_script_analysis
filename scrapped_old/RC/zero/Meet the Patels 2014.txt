Do you want me to hold this so you No thats fine But we both need to talk into it so maybe put it in the middle of us Wait not with your headphones because youre going to be yelling otherwise Oh right You got your headphones on and you got this thing in your hand and youre like ll hold this How do we uh how do we wanna do this Do you wanna should just Just just start at the beginning of the story Right so So you know when think about our extended family always felt like growing up was the odd man out Mmmhmm But now think its all relative Like you know my entire life got made fun of for having a big nose People called me Gonzo So always thought this nose was kind of my obstacle to greatness And then recently was getting fitted for a hat as an actor Mmmhmm And the guy goes You have an unusually small head After all these years find out that my nose was perfect It was my head that was small Wait how did See what m saying So like you know like in terms of the family maybe m not the one whos out of place maybe it was an analogy Rav can you just get Start the story So start start it with the trip to India Right So story starts two years ago Here in had just broken up with Audrey and was miserable Wed been together for two years and had never told Mom and Dad about her in fact they were freaking out because you know here was almost thirty never married which in our culture is like Code red Code red And to make things worse two weeks after this breakup had to go on our annual family trip to India My dear when are you going to get married You know the later you show up to a restaurant the more limited the menu My prince youre killing us Zone two No Do you want us to die without the grandchildren You know Champa dont even think he wants to get married Dont do what Geeta did to us You and your sister cant live together forever If he wanted to get married He would be married You know that girl in Eat Pray Love you know she goes through a breakup goes on the existential journey to India to get over depression find out what she really wanted in life was that girl Except my family was with me the entire time The entire time Lets go Geeta Geets come on Ahhh Oh you have to buy one now the guys been working Four five Hey look too sexy for this And behind the camera was you sister Yeah Documentary filmmaker but by no means a cinematographer Thats why for the next hour and a half we will be treated to footage that is out of focus poorly framed and often has a microphone in the upper right hand corner We are having a great time with the family Next time we are going to come with the grandchildren Heres the thing In Mom and Dads eyes had never had a girlfriend and had no idea how to get a girlfriend Right So in their mind its like Hey were going to India its our last chance and maybe we can get him to get married the way we did Why do our marriages survive at a higher rate than the American marriage when you say have to be falling in love and it has to click Where you know the girl for a year or two the way Americans do and still of the marriages fail the reason is compatibility value the belief Yeah Like we got married me and Mom only talked to her minutes Does that mean you think that works for me as well Absolutely Absolutely If you ask me believe Yeah from the bottom of the heart not even a doubt Everything affects our thinking and liking whether you are going to put up with the person or not if your if her food habits are different Food habits is the first reason No no m giving you a reason at random You want to focus on a girl who has same value in the life and have been raised same way you have and especially keeping in mind the religion is same Now were not saying every Indian family is good for you That is why we select You had to check the family and the background because you only get minutes to meet the person Whereas m saying you date the person You get a better sense of who a person is No no no by spending time with that person than by finding out who their family is Thats why theres a matchmaking Aha If this girl is good with that boy but that boy is good with this girl so everybody is good everybody gets married at the end All the girls and all the boys get married What would be the downside of me marrying a white girl white girl a white girl Lets say American lets say a white American girl Heres where it gets a little tricky have a huge family all last name Patel And heres the thing theyre all married to Patels See these are the rules of being a Patel youre supposed to marry someone whos also named Patel Now its not incest Its its like a caste thing It means uh that theyre from this small little region of India Where we come from actually our hometowns probably want to say Eighty to Patel is Patels The story starts shes from Anand am from Dharmaj My brother got married to her sister was only she was We decided that both families you know liked each other And then we were told that we are going to meet each other at this persons house and our parents were waiting outside and we went in the room and given five minutes to take care of it We had a guy in the middle of us so theres no hankypanky In India the girls dont have much of a say in those days Girls have to get married to who their parents say so said No thats not fair said If you have anything in your mind you want to marry someone else let me know and will say no So that way you dont have to say no went back and told my family said This is the girl want to marry It took five minutes though Right We never said anything just hi hello and thats it Lets get married And lets get married Right Right And m supposed to get a girl from where Ideally Its a triangle That would be ideal for Patel Uhhuh So if found a girl from this Kapadvanj in Kheda Hmm Oh youre shaking your head already thats way too far How far apart do they have to be for it to be justified Well usually there should be no relation Because everyone is probably still a lot of these people are probably still related way down the road m pretty sure they are at some point but dont know that much history of it Before we go any further let me just take you back Take it from the top one two three India Dad entered the world Twentytwo years later Dads entire village pooled their money to send him to America You know came to America with eight dollars in my pocket Thats all thats all had Look at me now Dad enrolled at Michigan Tech He and six other guys from India shared one room and one bank account You know had to look up every word in the dictionary every word Having a weak English lexicon left me feeling lugubrious acrimonious cantankerous m sorry am being superfluous Look at me now Dads dad called him and told him Its time to get married Dad flew to India got an arranged marriage came back with Mom You know some people they date then they get married We did it opposite Look at me now dont know how they fell in love but they are the happiest couple ve ever seen you were born Yup Three years later was born had a very happy childhood but the older got the more lived a double life At home was Indian Ravi spoke Gujarati hung out with Indians watched Indian movies Outside the house was American Ravi Hi Ma spoke English hung out with Americans watched American movies My my dating history is short Growing up dating wasnt allowed In fact if a girl ever called the house there was an interrogation afterwards Right The expectations were clear was gonna have a perfect Indian wife Shed be a wonderful mother a great cook that was the plan So was shocked when the first girl really fell for was Hey were on hayride redhead from Connecticut Doe a dear a female deer Audrey was my first and only girlfriend ever Okay look a little weird because um m on night vision Were gonna get in trouble Youre really high up You know we were pretty serious Um Madonna Snoop Doggy Dog oh hes a hes a painter hes a computer guy What She has so many amazing qualities mean just that she could dance at a drop of a hat for no reason She has a lot of sensibilities that most yearold mothers have She loves a good howto book Any puppy videos Aww If theres a video online where people are crying shes watching it and shes crying too mean we were together for two years and it definitely felt like Okay its time to tell Mom and Dad that she exists That was good right But somehow there was still something else inside me like in my gut that just didnt sit well and didnt really know what it was Is there a term for it the Indian Problem said Look just cant live this double life anymore You know cant hide this relationship from my parents its not fair to you or them And dont know just couldnt do it anymore So We broke up Its not the idea of marrying a girl thats a problem would get married You know m want to be married but for me specifically dont want to You know doing it like a job interview In a bestcase scenario think could marry a girl six months after meeting her Hey that was different though man No no no no know the process No no no no Right It gets me stressed out just thinking about it think just never questioned that would find the girl want and would find her in kind of a normal American way like in the movies Ray Excuse me In the middle of nowhere Can help you it would be romantic You complete me You had me at hello And wouldnt need my parents to do it for me cause its pathetic mean theyre setting up the dates Right In my case theyre probably texting me in the middle of it And then youre waiting to find out whether you get a second date not from her but from Mom and Dad From Mom and Dad Its like its like exactly the relationship have with my acting agents Like theyll call me up and be like My prince my prince darling baby good news Talked to Seemas parents looks like they want to bring you in for a callback Vasant coffee So heres the deal its going to be Friday night youre going to take her to Chinese Now listen they love you Dont do anything new Same stuff Nothing tricky were hearing its between you and two guys named Raj All right Oh and hey Ravi good luck dont blow it Hit the girls So the next stop was Dads village Right Theres literally a pile of crap everywhere you go they need to figure out how to pottytrain the cows right Dads village is like the belly of the beast Right cause we are related to everybody Yeah and they all immediately had one question Imagine the most annoying person in your family whos kinda always in your business asking all sorts of questions and youre trying to just get out of the situation Now imagine an entire village filled with that person Like in The Matrix you know where that bad guy is like multiplying over and over again Dads one of the most respected people know but Mom might be an even bigger deal because she is known as a matchmaker So its a huge failure in Moms eyes that her own kids arent married and shes the best in the business Decembers actually wedding season in India meaning Indians from all over the world come to India not just to meet each other but To marry Yeah To marry each other Everyone except for us No No Wow When too many people like us are telling you that my prince this thing works at least you need to close your eyes one day for hours and think all these people are telling you And think that there could be some truth The whole world cannot be wrong Yeah the whole world cannot be wrong my prince remember sitting there and m looking at Mom and Dad on stage and you know this charity that And this whole event which is put on just because of their own efforts and you know it reminded me just how much love our family and how much love our culture Where were from Yeah you know when have kids kinda wanted them to have the same feeling the same experience And grow up the way we did Yeah and go on trips like like these Yeah And thats when it all became clear to me that you know maybe thats why had broken up with Audrey because you know wanted this So what happened What changed your mind guess had this realization that whenever in my head imagined who it was that was gonna marry it was this Indian girl Yet here was almost and hadnt found one yet and started doing the math mean when we were in India it was like looking around theres Indians everywhere those guys have it easy But live in America and here am looking for an Indian girl whos Gujarati and Patel more specifically And single And female by the way and all these other normal things that people look for cute smart funny And she has to love you She has to love me have to love her we have to find each other mean theres a lot of odds stacked against me Right And then here Dad was saying Trust me this is gonna work and was like ya know what Maybe maybe m being closeminded Right This system has worked for so many people People that are like me m so happy Little punk Dashing through the snow In a onehorse open sleigh er the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight National Lampoon Comedy Radio back in the studio uh people arent normally invited back so quickly but love him do uh Ravi Patel welcome back have missed you so Youre first generation m first generation you know its a generally strict culture specifically the kind of Indian that am which is Gujarati d say about of the Indians that you meet in America are Gujarati Patels Patels a very com There are know a lot of Patels Yeah Patels very common like my name Ravi Patel is like John Smith Right Patels are hardcore and theres so many of you Theyre useless vegetarians youre physically small humans The first word that came to mind was cheap Patels own motels or own hotels or you know Elevens If pay to stay somewhere its purely as a result of me not making enough phone calls You know its really like Gujarati people in America are often the working class in India that came over came to America actually in December When our children came to a marriage age there was a need for some kind of matchmaking girl to a boy This book gives the names and addresses of all the villages And these are all Patels All Patels Oh yeah All Patels Problem is all the Patels who came they are spread all over states in America How do you still follow the same system that was workable back home in the small area but not workable here because of the geographic you know the distance So what happened What happened is they invented the biodata The biodata is a sheet of paper like a resume that the parents pass around to help them make an informed decision when theyre making matches Nobody writes their own biodata Its done by committee and its a very rosy picture of yourself that really isnt you never gave my mom an actual physical biodata refused was like m not going to resume myself out on a piece of paper and shes like Give me a resume and so sent her my work resume ve never seen mine ve never cause just dont want to know go to a wedding and run into this lady Shes like Oh my God come sit down next to me you are just youre so wonderful and gosh you know had your dad sent a better picture of you you could have been my daughterinlaw And m like Heres whats on my biodata date of birth height weight occupation education hobbies and then theres stuff have no interest in like parents location and work history sibling location and work history horoscope caste skin complexion theres wheatish brown think ve seen almond brown Its like the lighter you are the more attractive you are They talk about the homely wheatish complexion girl mean its a running joke Well one the word homely is used wrong Hey Hasmukh whats up Listen got your daughters biodata oh great job mean Ph Really Okay see heres the thing Um Raj is more of a wheatish brown hes just yeah hes just had a good life and weve kept him out of the sun on purpose So good to talk to you and good luck with that dark daughter of yours Congrats again on the Ph great job So after gave Mom and Dad my biodata they could officially release it into the marketplace Within weeks my biodata was in the hands of uncles aunts family friends and complete strangers Now while my biodata was circulating out there in the marketplace Mom and Dad were simultaneously receiving other peoples biodatas Then what they do is filter them based on what type of women they think would be a good fit for me Looks good so m going to forward this to Ravi okay And by the end of January got my first batch of biodatas Dad sent me biodatas so basically pictures and resumes of matrimonial candidates which is totally normal Right This is the one like the most shes shes pounds Is she getting one of these of you would imagine yeah And can she also veto or give the thumbsup Yeah this is her preferences oh they have a preferences section at the bottom Ooh Hindu Gujarati speaking must have moderate family and religious values Preferences Academic or professional career dont know how got this Now phonecall phase is its straight up coldcalling Hey my name is Ravi my mother Champa gave me your biodata which was given to her by Kokilabhen who was given to her by Mahendrabhai who happens to be your uncle think love that get to watch this This is so weird mean wait so when m talking to you during the date at some point m gonna talk to you right No why would you talk to me during the date Just pretend youre not there the whole time Yeah What Ravi Thats how this is done m supposed to pretend like youre not there Youre just having a date m just filming This whole Thats not just anything thats weird Thats just weird m a little nervous this is like uh really weird m nervous too okay youre not the only one Okay good Do you want a drink by the way Are you gonna get one Yeah Like ve played a doctor like times Really Typical Yeah Yeah know its the next best thing for my parents have a lot of um Asian friends Okay so well go like dinner karaoke Its so much fun Wait hold on time out why do you have so many Asian friends Well started off as a computer science major love chocolate but what girl doesnt m a big m a big chocolate fan You like chocolate too My parents love talking about blood pressure forever theyve always been talking whats your Yeah So whatd you think of her think shes really cool dont know well see dont know whatd you think You were there whatd you think guess thats the upside afterwards can be like So what did you think Should we uh should we call her back dont know Geeta what do you think dont know if shes for us So theres this one time were on this family trip driving through Tennessee in the station wagon we had to stop somewhere for the night Of course were Patels were cheap we always stayed in motels Then we get to the motel Of course its owned by a Patel That was every trip Dad looks back at me with this grin cause he knows hes hit the jackpot Somehow this is going to save us money He goes in he goes Hey you know we need a room for the night The guy looks up Patel Patel Next thing know were having dinner with them remember m like laying on the carpet like changing channels on the like its my place Dad is talking to this uncle who we just met And its like theyve known each other forever Moms in the kitchen cooking you know making samosas It was like a family reunion It was almost as if we had made the trip just to see them And of course the next day we leave And dont know that we ever talked to them again dont think we did Thats what love about being Patel They dont keep score they dont count favors You are unconditionally a part of the biggest family in the world Hey Dad m good Hey so listen theres a lot of girls from other parts of the country theres a lot of girls from Toronto Yeah thats the problem like what m supposed to like Pretty impressive Yeah that was Would have been more impressive if you Met the woman of your dreams Yeah mean didnt come out of that trip feeling like Oh just met the one But came out of that trip feeling like Okay think will And uh by the way felt accomplished just having gone on dates around the country Thats crazy Yeah right but for them was a huge number mean Dad found Mom after women Yeah but hes clearly better at this than am ve probably been on to What Yeah ve been doing this since was And how many of those resulted in second dates None Well we should be talking about you then mean why are you failing So they were like trying to pressure me into like getting an arranged marriage and m like no dont want to do it they were like lets put an ad in the paper cause thats what a lot of people do is they go there they put an ad in the classifieds In the matrimonial section The classified is labeled matrimonial Its like Seeking an alliance for our daughter Thats like Victorian England The fact that the term alliance is used Alliance is the right word Alliance is the right word yeah Homely and comely whoever knows what that means Homely and comely wheatish complexion From my perspective that sounds incredibly racist or odd you know Yeah but like right It does doesnt it They sell a lotion in India called Fair And Lovely and people like lather it onto their skin Its a skinbleaching lotion skinbleaching lotion No way to try and get lighter They have a male version now thats called Fair And Handsome Oh Fair skin is a big deal Like right now if my mom saw me in the sun right now shed be like Ahh your marriage value is plummeting got to tell you like based on what ve gone through with my parents so far like hope it does work really do You really do You hope it does Absolutely like look if the end is that end up with a girl that think is amazing and want to be with

you know that Well see dont even know dating that well havent done it that much okay really havent like dont date right went through this like fouryear period decided mean would even tell my friends about this that decided that wanted to date an Indian girl and if the only way could do that is if literally cut myself off from everything else that was starving so bad for a woman and knowing that that was the only way That would go after it that much harder And it didnt work When was this Right before Audrey thought it would help me get closer to finding an Indian did the same thing You did the same thing Even though was born here and considered American it wasnt like ever really considered myself American ve never seen my parents kiss like intimacy wasnt something did you guys have that saw my dad kiss my mom on the cheek one time and was like Whoa You know theyd put me to sleep wed rattle off all the different Hindu God names at the end theyd say Okay study hard no boys no blacks no Muslims good night My grandmother is probably the most racist human being ve ever met but shes like the most lovable human being They just look in a tunnel and they cant kind of see outside of that wasnt allowed to date girls werent allowed to call the house When got to college there was a ton of Indian people right most of the girls they called them Snapback girls those were the ones that always went after didnt date anyone till They were never allowed to date in high school right or their whole lives so when they got to college the freedom oh my God And was in a fraternity dont know how to really talk to men in order to let them know that would be interested in them or how to like play the game and like you know have them hunt me or whatever theyre supposed to do Yeah Mom come sit lets do cheers love that were celebrating your anniversary in sweatpants Okay cheers Happy anniversary Happy anniversary Thank you Happy anniversary to us My kids are the lovely kids go upstairs Shes sitting in a chair or a stool or something Probably a little intimidated because this guy is from America was the one who asked the questions And she never asked me any question Which was a big setup because she never opened her mouth there but she never shut up after the marriage But let me tell you when talked to him we only talked maybe minutes And even then And he made me laugh Like crazy asked her one of the questions was and this is true How far have you traveled She said traveled all the way to Pavagadh Now Pavagadh is only miles away So she thought that was far To her that was a big accomplishment guess Vasant thats not true mean you know how can disappoint her in life when shes happy with mile travel But you know what the bottom line is Ravi still believe when you are ready you will find a girl Just like a guru they said in the Bhagavad Gita Bhagavad Gita says When you are ready for a guru you dont ever look for a guru Guru will come to you know that know that at the end of all these failed dates you guys just see failure But what see is that its helped me figure out what want see progress see that oh ve figured out that you know what But you know what m learning m learning Now know what kind of girl want Oh got a ticket God Oh God Do you have to do it this way Ready Okay ready Okay Hey can talk to you for a sec Not really So what do you think Notice anything different Hair color trying to age myself up Youre anticipating a little bit am little bit Ready Yeah please All right here What are you doing m taking it off Youre taking it off m taking it right off Did tell you Audrey made me a goodluck cake Whats going on This is like the unhealthiest relationship Its the unhealthiest nonrelationship And then came home and she was there came to your house and she was there Why did you not tell me that you guys were hanging out Well wasnt trying to like hide it from you mean was trying to hide it from you but it just wasnt a big deal mean we ran into each other one day and the next thing you know were like laughing about how miserable dating can be And it was good to just be friends But there are rules like when you break up there are rules that you have to follow that About how the breakup goes Yeah but we spent time apart We were both dating other people so its not like we werent You know its not like we were trying to get back together or anything we were just hanging out You guys were barely dating other people it hadnt been that long We were best friends got this girl here in Boston and when were going to the wedding there theres a girl named Seema that really want him to meet her Did you tell him already No m gonna call him and let him know but just wanted to let you know But think since we are going to be there anyway it would be nice to meet with her remember Mom calls me up and she goes My prince big wedding season My prince hit the girls Beginning of wedding season If the sky that we look upon Should tumble and fall And the mountains should crumble to the sea But how are we going to set it up lets talk about it Its not going to happen automatically Yeah No no no do not do that thats where you guys go too far m telling you m gonna take care of it dont want you guys jumping in and getting all these other people involved thats when it becomes embarrassing Were not going to do anything you dont want us to do Okay Its given Okay just then relax then Were done When you talk to her she may not know why you are talking to her Dont be shy talk to her man Well support you my dear dont worry Well support you You are my son m telling you you guys are treating me like m like socially retarded m m very good socially Ravi you are socially good except when it comes to marriage Marriage right Dont just look at her and say Oh dont like her dont do that You guys think do that but you just youre so desperate for me to like someone that you dont trust when make my own choices and give everyone a fair chance To like somebody youve got to get to know somebody m saying at least talk to the person Why do you love Mom and Dad Because youve been with them for all these years So if you Take a little interest Okay and you know what will happen if nothing lets say you do not like you may say that Oh my friend might be right for her Ah Introduce to a friend This is the most unnecessary pep speech ve ever gotten in my life Yeah Okay lets go Geeta are we done my dear Yeah did dont like her What do you mean how do you know you just know dont like her So put your camera away Was that Mom told Mom and Dad m like Hey shes great like shes a really great person but m not really into her Mmmhmm You know in that way By no fault of her own m just Yeah You know and uh theyre like Well just just talk to her And m like okay but mean ll talk to her But like its just weird Mmmhmm Like m supposed to call her now on Friday and its just like ugh am so afraid of hurting other peoples feelings Me too Like feel really bad like shes like a great girl and dont want her to think that m rejecting her Because thats not really what it is Yeah You guys have it harder because you have to actually approach the women Or you know culturally thats Its easy for women women just have to be You just have to be And Then ugh You know what realized its not easy because thought we just had to be but think thats why m single because didnt know this whole eye contact thing like you have to actually allow someone Whats the eye contact thing Well dont really never did eye contact growing up like you have We have to give you guys a signal that Yeah were interested Or like Yeah at least acknowledge that you exist If a girls looking around you have to look right at her which is really scary Well whats the difference between that and staring Cause know how to stare m excited because Ravi promised me five grandkids You appear to be not promising but sort of leaning towards three Which makes it a potential eight Ravi gave me one fiveyear time period Guaranteed almost You are noncommittal But assume same time period Hey listen Its been easy sailing until now Life is a commitment So you have to make some commitments Mmm Hello Hello Whats up Someone didnt come home last night Yeah Youre an idiot What What Were you at Audreys We didnt do nothing we just fell asleep Well she cooked me we like made dinner then we watched a movie and fell asleep Okay So So are you going to get back together with her Audrey and met when we both worked in the same bar and we had been friends for a few years But all of a sudden we started hanging out a lot and then one night she came over to watch a movie and that was when things you know started to get a little weird You know towards as the movie went on wed slowly kinda cuddle a little bit but in very noncommittal cuddling so our toes like think our feet started getting closer together and then next thing you know our legs was so nervous that was like remember was stuttering a lot Um Do do you think we should um like we should uh like this is like this is weird right And she was looking at me and then she just goes And of course to me the burytheheadinthepillow was like a bad sign because thats the only way m willing to interpret any situation with a girl is like rejection She was really nervous too was like should we start dating or something or And she was like Yeah guess and then walked her to her car and m saying bye and like this is the first time its been this kind of a bye was like Well should we kiss She goes like Yeah guess and then we go in and its like a kiss and it is the worst kiss in the history of kisses Like it was disgusting you know because it was so forced and uncomfortable and we were friends Any man would have handled that better than me think And so there was a lot of just selfloathing Right And at the same time dont remember ever feeling that level of exhilaration in terms of happiness and just excitement that this was happening Even though you had a bad kiss too But the second one was incredible My sister has her son living with her and she has three kids grandkids and dont know how to tell you its very rewarding peaceful tell you they are just simply call them they are happy happy happy family you know But what can say America is different And thats the only thing regret about myself that wish didnt come that early because my kids would have been maybe somewhat different and could have had a similar life to what my family has Familywise staying together and all that Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah because they came later on in the life so their beliefs are different When came to United States there were not Indians so you know we had to compromise the life and we did and uh and when you compromise you pay the price for it you know And that is the price we are paying for it right now think Were happy though Were happy And we are gonna be happy we are gonna be just as happy as them We are happy We are different but we are happy yeah Hey Ma Yeah theres serious interest send it to me Okay Ma ah Mom Mom do you guys remember the conversation we had about you guys sending me girls that are that are American Okay okay okay Shes from India shes overweight and shes an engineer Yeah Thats not the best pitch If the biodata thing doesnt work if the Internet dating doesnt work if youre still not able to meet her at a wedding or say a motel owners expo theres still one last shot at meeting the perfect Patel girl The Patel convention People get together for two or three days and purpose was to bring their boy and a girl children together and they have programs and dance and speeches and all that basically to see if you can find Just like a business expo We have a sheet and youre going to go to people of the opposite sex and youre gonna go introduce yourself and go see if they can fill out a box Okay Theres already one marriage out of it somebody that met last year is already married and theres another couple thats almost there to Icebreakers Three and a half hours of icebreakers cant think of a more efficient way to meet women though rarely meet Indian girls that like talking to m getting in the practice of like pursuing women which unfortunately m almost years old and really genuinely feel like m bad at it Well youre Indian youre not going to be good So if a girl has Georgia and a boy has Atlanta you guys match up okay hope you guys know your states and capitals dont like how look My hair look ridiculous Geeta this is fine right Mmmhmm It is right Why doesnt anyone tell me how stupid look Did you see any guys down there you like Geets No bunch of Indians in business casual they probably just thought its like an engineering conference Theyve got to think its absolutely fascinating m sure theyre all just in there making faces Yeah theyre white they dont get it We have to kind of do one of these They dont get it Its like required Theyre white they dont get it Hey m Ravi Yeah Anisha Hey m Ravi Hey m Ravi Hey m Ravi Hey m Ravi Hey m Ravi try to stay away from Canada as much as possible Why My mom and dad keep on calling me over and over again This is exhausting isnt it animal sounds Is that what you do You just find other people making your noise Meow Meow Oh yeah Hey m Ravi Anisha Nice to meet you Are you good at this No Hey m Ravi oh wait we already met Nice to meet you too Nice to meet you too This is fun Its weird and fun at the same time yeah Yeah think we should do this all the time This is great wait whats next um mean emailed him and he didnt email me back Its that simple What are you going through Mom but thats not true Ravi this is my first problem our friendship isnt based on friendship anymore wish it were Our friendship is based at least on my part in my hope that we will work out will be honest with you dont have an interest in just being your friend have an interest in being your partner have an interest in making sure youre happy and healthy and moving forward in your life but have an interest in doing that by your side m not trying to be dramatic or emotional just practical wish more than anything that we could be just friends but think at this point its impossible need to remove you from my life Its too difficult for me to move forward if you are around ll always be grateful for the friendship and love we were able to have Oh man dont know how could handle like not being friends with her thats the toughest part for me know its immature on my part but like you know like think could really think could could could not be with her and be okay You know Did you love her think so dont really have anything else to But yeah mean like Like whats love dont know what love is thats why mean dont know know that you know know that know that care a lot about her and she cares a lot about me and we know each other inside out and she makes me a better person in so many ways That weekend we went and visited a bunch of family in Iowa and theyre all you know vintage Patels They all live under the same roof as their parents with their kids Yeah You know in fact our cousins represent what Mom and Dad wanted us to be For both of you its time to get married It said in the Scriptures that you should marry early so your mind is fixated on a certain individual before it starts fluttering away was looking around and our extended family represents a version of life that always thought would have and for the first time was starting to doubt whether or not thats what d end up with But then was also scared of in the pursuit of all these things ending up alone think first thing we should talk about is how much do you respect this process that parents or whoever can screen and can do it have a ton of respect for the process in fact Are you giving that respect when we say Meet this girl No because dont And if you dont meet if that respect is not understood by the children and children casually throw Oh dont like this dont click That is when tell Mom say You know what forget it we are not going to do this Because they think we found these online somewhere at random that we dont know anything about this and that we throw them because we want to get them married in hurry and we dont care who they get married with really believe my prince you are not being fair to yourself You are not giving yourself enough chance you are not giving your life a fair chance It is a mindset We dont have the same mindset you do and honestly dont even have the same mindset That is why Geeta you are not married and m telling you the reasoning If you are ready to know that why Geeta is not married why other people are getting married then m going to tell you the differences my dear that the other girls are in the mindset to get married they dont want to just reject right away They want to get to know people they meet second time they talk to them on the phone they just dont go on and on rejecting like you No no no not this My point is not getting married and staying single is the biggest loser you can be said yes to him but when did say yes didnt say yes said Yes guess when he asked me Yeah guess you said You didnt say yes Hes like Will you marry me and m like You said m gonna throw up and then you said Yeah guess But did marry him twice One Catholic wedding and one Sikh wedding Yeah we did two weddings So we that was the beginning of our compromise Like walked down the aisle wearing a white dress to Here Comes the Bride like literally laughing the whole time because thought it was so absurd came down a street on a horse wearing a turban carrying a sword Petes Catholic so we said that our kids will be baptized And negotiated the communion but couldnt get confirmation Confirmation She said that was brainwashing Its dont know if said brainwashing You said brainwashing you really did Oh okay And quite honestly m still hoping we can open up that conversation and continue the negotiation down the road Honestly dont know much about Catholicism got you Catholicism For Dummies got it know havent finished reading my Catholicism For Dummies We dont thank Jesus we thank God We thank God because we both share God Cause Jesus isnt God really You have Guru Nanak have Jesus But see theyre gurus both Jesus and Guru Nanak Theyre both gurus theyre not Gods Dude you cant call Jesus a guru think hes Hes not a guru Have yourself a merry little Christmas You have no messages Let your heart be light From now on Our troubles will be out of sight Isnt this a cute picture Ravi Have you guys ever considered getting a clothesline Why do you think we can afford a million dollar house Because we dont waste money love this picture This is like the closest an Indian picture ever gets to kissing This would be considered obscene by some people Geeta Hey this is Geeta And this is Geeta And this is Geeta waited until you left for the gym because knew we could not do this on camera and didnt want to run the risk of you being around So Mom and Dad were both in the kitchen Mom was cooking Dad was reading at a table And just sat down and said Hey need to tell you guys something And dont know any other way to say this but before we went to India had been dating this girl for two years And never told you about her and m sorry about that But we broke up just before the trip Then Dad looks up and asks Well wait so all this biodata stuff this was a lie told him No we broke up but every time went on a date think was comparing them to Audrey Mom was just staring at the floor And then she goes Well do you still love her And just said dont know And then thats when you came home Dad hows your trip going Turn around Trip is going terrific We are having great time Geeta Very good time Mom hows your trip going Mom the way look at the way youre handling this right now is consider the way youre handling this Put that camera down right now Theres a mature way know your mom And you know how great a person she is She is emotionally just Taken away and she is very emotional And shell come around really trust both of you guys for the decisions may disagree may do different things but who are we that we always know what is right you know We dont know always what is right After told them about Audrey they were In shock You know Dad was coping with it we were communicating but with Mom it got really bad She barely spoke with you during that time Her and couldnt seem to communicate and dont mean dont think it was coincidental mean we just started fighting About everything like little things and was home one day and just kind of sat her down and was like What is this whats happening was like dont understand like feel like cant make you happy with anything do and just dont feel like m your son anymore She says You know its not that you might not marry an Indian girl Its that you lied to me for so long That you could do that And just said was sorry and that wont lie to you again Okay All right Okay Okay used to think that the way was feeling my struggle was because of them And then one day they came to visit me and started crying was just like you know dont even date any guys dont do anything and feel so Like my hands are tied said feel like have to marry an Indian Dad stopped me and he said want you to know that no matter what you do we love you and well accept it And he said Nothing matters more to me than you being happy thought that would feel different thought that would feel like the weight had been lifted And when drove home the weight was still there And realized that it wasnt them it was me was scared that if married a white guy even if it was okay with them that somehow would be letting myself down Dont give me too much food Mom Okay You want vaal my prince You want chole Mom youre like a traveling Youre like a food truck Like world hunger progr Ten minutes okay You want tuvaro Mmm Yeah Tuvaro Okay You want samosas No m okay right now Youre okay so m giving you samosas then Give her some okay Because know she will like it Ravi This whole year You met different girls from all over and really want to know what have you learned You know when we were doing this you know it was very much about finding that Patel girl but honestly like dont after doing all this the one thing feel like ve learned is that dont dont need that You know mean still want that but dont need What do you mean Well like dont need her to be Indian Yeah dont need her to be Indian Mom what would you think Mom what would you think if ended up with a girl who wasnt Indian but shes Indian in every way that you want She has a beautiful family and shes a familyoriented person and she loves me and she loves you guys If she learns how to cook Indian food with you and you love hanging out with her Are you cool with it Are you cool with her just not being Indian would just love whoever you fall in love with my dear would be just happy would be happy the one you find And mean it too So Ravi just want you to get married now Seriously Bottom line is go and get married Make a decision Time is running by Let me tell you one thing with the girl you get married you will never know her enough Never know enough Even after years of marriage He still doesnt know me Its still a discovery So if you think want to know her enough thats an impo thats why you get married and thats the fun of getting married because you keep discovering Yeah You know after years we tell each other Oh you dont understand me Now after years dont understand her Youre gonna know somebody in two years do tell him that What do you say Mom And you know what Ravi After years She goes do tell him that Ravi after years Shes still trying to change me And keep telling her And you too Lets not have one way here Okay So Thank you Every day You should have done that and You should be not doing this and he should be doing this should not be doing this And how do you handle this And m like Go to sleep Thats right is for the way you look at me is for the only one see is very very extraordinary Let me catch you up to speed In December broke up with Audrey He needs therapy then went to India then back to America then did some biodating Dont do anything sneaky with the camera Internet dating marriage conventions Meow and weddings Dont be shy talk to her man The next December told my parents the truth In March started yet another dating system The Ravi dates whoever makes him happy kind of like a normal person system Um think part of the problem was was carrying this picture around in my head of who was going to marry when really thats just not how it works It was time to just allow the world to put that picture together for me And it worked found the girl that really really liked and for the first time could see what really wanted liked her and had to beg her to like me back You really begged Well it was the only option Like you really begged Yeah we get it Okay You really begged Do you want me to say something It was great was starting a relationship truthfully for the first time And just letting it be whatever it was going to be That said Mom and Dad still didnt understand the concept of dating Okay Geeta Can you stop the camera now Geeta Yeah turn that off please It just Yeah Geeta theres no reason for it now Oh my God How did it go Just be yourself Whats the big deal Its just a camera How does it make you feel Dad tell me how does it make you feel that Geeta just went on a date Geeta tell me what is love
