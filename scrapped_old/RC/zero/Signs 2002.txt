what it is An outoftown woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didnt have her favourite cigarettes at the vending machine She scared a couple of the customers No ones seen her since And my point is we dont know anything about the person you saw and we should just keep all possibilities available Dad wheres the remote dont know baby Why dont you check in the sofa cushions Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night what else might be a possibility m not done asking questions and dont appreciate sarcasm Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you maybe aa church member who who might not have liked the fact that you left the church dont think so Okay was out of line with the whole female ScandinavianOlympian thing Its just m pretty strong and m pretty fast And was running as fast as could and this guy he was he was just toying with us Theres only food under the sofa Baby why dont you just change the channel on the television did And Same shows on every station Every station Bo turn up the volume Crop signs first emerged in the late s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life They died out by the early s dismissed as hoaxes This new resurgence is wholly different The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries There are only a limited number of explanations Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created or basically its for real Extraterrestrials What in Gods name is going on did some research after saw your crops Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes Really Thats how these things have been done in the past But there are so many now How could so many people be in on it cant think straight m m gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgars coffee and and try to think clear And after that ll might make some calls But ll tell you something what said in there it still goes Your your family has been through a lot And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world Now take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things hmm Good medicine Thats good advice And you take care of yourself Graham The footage youre watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a yearold local cameraman in Bangalore a southern city of India Its the th reported crop sign found in that

But it wasnt working Morgan this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their lives Theyre like and they work up little codes together and they analyse Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in They do stupid crap like this to feel special Its a scam Nerds were doing it years ago and new nerds are doing it again Its just static Morgan alright Turn it up See Its a code Why cant they get girlfriends Can see that please Its noise Its broken Morgan Its just gonna keep doing this Maybe some new batteries We might lose the signal This is exactly what the nerds want m getting out now Nobody move Voices Did you hear that Not English though You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill heard them Morgan Probably

clearer the higher you hold it got it Bo honey dont want you climbing on the car Come here Stop Theres two of them talking Isabel youre gonna feel very silly when this turns out to be all just makebelieve Youre wasting your time here m not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or or anybody Youre not going to get famous Okay Lets turn on the It first appeared minutes ago Mexico City officials as well as Officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either governments air force The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico en route from Mazatlan to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space They were not detected by radar by either country The nerds were right We have to tape this My ballet recital Listen Bo this is very important Everything people have written about in science books is going to change The history of the worlds future is on the right now We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there For your children Bo My ballet recital Dad Find another tape Uncle Merrill m using your tape You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here in Mexico City This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way What youre seeing is real Its unbelievable Everything they wrote in science books is about to change told you Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world Thats true Do you think it could be Yes How can you say that That wasnt the answer you wanted Couldnt you pretend to be like you used to be Give me some comfort People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky Group number one sees it as more than luck more than coincidence They see it as a sign evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them Group number two sees it as just pure luck a happy turn of chance m sure the people in group number two are looking at those lights in a very suspicious way For them the situation isnt Could be bad could be good But deep down they feel that whatever happens theyre on their own And that fills them with fear Yeah there are those people But theres a whole lot of people in the group number one When they see those lights theyre looking at a miracle And deep down they feel that whatevers going to happen therell be someone there to help them And that fills them with hope See what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you Are you the kind who sees signs sees miracles Or do you believe that people just get lucky Or look at the question this way is it possible that there are no coincidences was at this party once m on the couch with Randa McKinney She was just sitting there looking beautiful staring at me go to lean in and kiss her and realise have gum in my mouth So turn take out the gum stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa and turn around Randa McKinney throws up all over herself knew the second it happened it was a miracle could have been kissing her when she threw up That would have scarred me for life may never have recovered m a miracle man Those lights are a miracle There you go So which type are you Do you feel comforted Yeah do Then what does it matter never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die She said See Then her eyes glazed a bit And then she said Swing away You know why she said that Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head There is no one watching out for us Merrill We are all on our own What do you know Well there was an accident drunk driving they werent sure He wasnt drunk Ray fell asleep at the wheel Is he okay Yeah That was the first thing Colleen asked too Shes talking What ambulance is she in Shes not in an ambulance Father For the kids protection All they were doing was watching from am felt like they were getting obsessed like you said They should be playing furry furry rabbit or tea party or something Whats furry furry rabbit Its a game isnt it Anyways they closed the schools And theres been some interesting developments What time is it am Theyre gone but theyre not really gone We just cant see them Early this morning a bird flew into the area where the lights were hovering last night It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down They caught it on tape Theyve been playing it all morning The footage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky They found the bird His his head was crushed in They think they have some kind of invisibleshield thing going llike an optical illusion Theyre still there hovering Some people think theres more of them now all over the place over us even Theres a theory about the c the crop circles They could be some kind of some kind of landmark visual mapping system so they could navigate coordinate makes sense Want to hear a story Is it true So the aliens cant read our minds Oh Oh of course They tell you everything in this book It says theyre probably very small like my height because as their brains develop there was no use for physical development It also says theyre probably vegetarians because they would have realised the benefits of such a diet Who wrote this book Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs That means theyre unemployed If youre gonna make fun of it then forget it This is serious dont know what got into me There are pictures Dr Bimbu one of the authors of the book Bimbu Dad just asked his name You had a tone He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe or the other reason theyre hostile Theyve used up all the resources on their planet and theyre looking to harvest our planet next Here Looks a little like our house doesnt it Same windows Thats weird Yeah oh yeah Thats enough from Dr Bimbu for now Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something Hello Father Hello Hello m going out for a few minutes No one leaves this house no one Where you going Ray Reddys house Why think he just called here You dont think something bad will happen do you Morgan Why You have one of your feelings again Is it bad wont let anything bad happen to you dont want you to die Who said was gonna die Who said was gonna die Hello Ray What happened wrote your number down to call you Its been sitting next to the phone for months When knew it was inside the house couldnt think of any other number to call panicked Thank you for coming Father Youre welcome Ray worked so long that night ve never fallen asleep driving before never since Dont Most of the ride home there wasnt a car in sight in either direction If d have fallen asleep then would have ended up in a ditch with a headache And it had to be at that right moment that seconds when passed her walking It was like it was meant to be guess if this is the end of the world m screwed right People who kill reverends wives arent exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven Wh Where are you going Ray To the lake The way see it these places marked in crops and such none of them are really near water dont think they like water Cant be any worse than here Did you see something Ray know what ve done to you made you question your faith m truly sorry for what ve done to you and yours Alright And dont open my pantry Father found one of them in there and locked him in The startling footage were about to show you was photographed by a yearold Romero Valadarez This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his sons th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo Brazil It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago All initial opinions are this is genuine What youre about to see may disturb you Move children Vamanos Oh Hello The police are here am with them am a police officer just want to talk with you We know all about the hoax We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy waggon Just tell us your name and why you did it and well give you the same deal we gave the others Dont throw your life away son Oh Ah Oh Their skin changes colours Thats why we couldnt see them that night Tell me something Morgan Uh in this book of yours did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile Yes It said they would probably invade They would use ground tactics handtohand combat They wouldnt use our technology or fight an airborne battle cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons Then the planet would be useless to them How could anyone possibly know that information Its ridiculous What else did it say They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion One they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds maybe even thousands of years later Whats two They win m sorry what what book is this Is this really happening heard a theory that uh they dont like places near water Maybe wed be safe from them near a lake or something Sounds madeup saw one of them at Ray Reddys house cant be sure but got the distinct feeling he wanted to harm me So we can choose to believe this lake idea pack up and go or we can stay here hide inside our home wait it out We might be overreacting but m willing to live with that Either way at least well be together All those in favour of the lake idea raise your hand Yeah All those in favour of home raise your hand Okay My vote counts as two Thats bullshit Youre cheating Morgan calm down get two votes because represent two parents here We dont know anything yet Well be safe here anyway dont want to leave home This is where we lived with Mom Thats got nothing to do with this change my vote You cant change your vote All those in favour of home raise your hand This is ridiculous You lose Were going to board up every window in this house How do we know boards will do anything Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors The information were receiving comes from our affiliates across the world Dad Uncle Merrill Amman joins Nairobi Beijing and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights There are lights in over cities They think itll be within the hour Theyre appearing at or within one mile of crop signs They were for navigation They made a map Theyre gonna be within a mile of us Dad
