Brother My Lord Beothric He is mortally wounded Brother youre a king now Rule well as Father would have wished Eirick Brother Everybody has a story to tell about their lives My story begins the day die There is in nature an irregular occurrence when the sun burns red as the moon crosses its path This is the Blood Eclipse a time when a pathway could be opened between Heaven Earth and Hel which the Vikings called Valhalla Mittgard and Helheim The Viking Gods used holy relics as keys to unlock the gates to reign over man But over time the tale faded into myth Men abandoned the Viking Gods and embraced the new Christian God and his son Yet one God the God of Thunder did not forget He resolved to take on human form find the keys and reestablish the Viking Gods for all eternity Huh Row Jesus

most wise Warick the Wise Theres a fine name for a Viking Welcome back Did you decide What Am brave or a fool Both have to blow this horn in the face of Thor Tell me what should do He will be at Trondheim at the Henge of Stones For the Blood Eclipse Yes but you will have the gathered armies of the Trondelag to face We have an army Its been a very long time Mm You think your brothers gonna be glad to see you No So Eirick the Bloodletter has became Eirick the Harrower of Hell But my story is far from over now have to make a journey to the place dread most Home With the horn and protection of Lord Frey and Frejya believe all would be well and the Jomsberg would fight with me once more But nothing prepared me for the biggest betrayal that is yet to come Sven drop the anchor Look Jomsberg

Zealand Eirick Is that you It is Welcome home My Lord Good to see you old friend Hardly a moon goes by when our swords dont wet the ground with some poor bastards claret We only fight for gold now Not

this hall again Jorgen If you dont like it then give back your share and go My Lord Beothric and great captains of Jomsberg present Eirick son of Alfred Let my brother step forward Beothric Brother Eirick never thought d see you in this hall again never thought to come But now that have it feels good But have to say your hospitality leaves a little bit to be desired Youve not offered us even a sip of water let alone a drop of the hard stuff We drink mead in this hall to celebrate and to mourn Your being here is cause for neither We were warned youd come Come here to take back the throne of our father Brother no But then look around you brother See the poor trappings of our fathers era No No you do not gold coins m paid by the Byzantine emperor for a squadron of our warriors Arthur of the Angles pays me in silver so that may keep his throne safe For the younger and lesser brother sits on this throne and our kingdom is rich And now you come Youre mistaken brother did not return for the crown Instead ve been asked by the Gods to take on a battle with impossible odds With whom The God Thor Thor Just because he came back from the dead he thinks he can take on the God of Thunder came here to ask for your help not to be mocked Lets go No brother cannot allow you to leave listening ear for all who despise my reign a figurehead for those who would overthrow me Forgive me brother Take them away Search them and bring whatever you find to me m sorry Sorry sorry sorry Why dont you just give Lord Beothric what he wants Then we dont have to do this Someones approaching and its not one of us You are friends of My Lord Eirick We are Then know this He has been betrayed He and his fellows are in the dungeon might get you into the keep but by oath cannot raise a sword against my brothers But you might get him out get him back to the boat Eirick needs us Eirick need Yang Yes These Jomsberg are no brawlers my lass Theyre the finest warriors on earth Good Arrogant men fall easiest Well not pass that courtyard unseen wouldnt be so glum good Yorik Alcuin hurry up Go will join you in due time This leads straight to the dungeons Your friends are down there The king is sending us north with a slave for barter Do you hear that Shh Brynna Good Yes Yang m fine You m fine Come Open the gate Fuck you whore Open the door Open the door Whatever you say my lady Hey its the little man Yang good No Yang youre fucking brilliant Wheres Eirick Next cell Oh By Odins blind eye what have they done to you Brynna wheres the horn With Alcuin Where is he The druid and the horn where are they Cut them down d stay still if were you My Lord See how he betrays his brother May he not treat you the same What did Thor offer you to betray me Why all of the Angle Isles to rule as see fit You see brother youre not the only one with the counsel of the Gods You can keep your Angle Isles and the throne But understand this When have subdued Thor will come back for you and we will have our reckoning It is you who does not understand brother The horn itself commands the highest price Without it youre worthless King of Jomsberg Would this be what you seek You bastard Traitor My my This is a fine thing You see brother the message was very simple Your brothers coming and he carries the Horn of Helheim Retrieve it and capture him And with the help of your friend here have So now its time for my reckoning with you Take him away Treat him as befits a royal Use a sword Throw the rest of a cliff Druid come Drink with me thought there was a traitor amongst us Its Alcuin the wizard He owes us his life How could he do that In return for Beothrics gold My Lord we are with you We will take you away from this place and give you shelter We will also gather our group of men to join you to fight the Trondelag What about the other captains For them its treason That looks like it hurts Let me If this quest goes on too much longer there wont be much of you left Weve lost the horn The odds are against us Could we not fight without it The horn is the only thing that can stop Thor Maybe have no right to ask the men to go on Or you know you said you would ask no more of me than any man but what if wanted to give you what only a woman can Brynna promised my heart to another many years ago wondered how ever loved such a human fool Freyja No Be still there Dont turn around We are far from one another right now but through this can speak barter myself with the Gods so that you might live again But your life came with a condition that you and can never experience love again But at least you lived d rather be dead than live my life without you You must brought you back so that you should live We can no longer be Eirick stop living in memories If a man spends his life looking backwards hell miss whats right in front of him And what is right in front of me Hope chance for joy happiness chance for the one thing that mortals have that the Gods desire love Its no shame to love again For what little time is left Thor has Then fight for your right to tomorrow Fight so that your name is whistled down the ages as a name for goodness for worth and for light m m sorry didnt mean to If you take me m yours ll think about it My Lord know that look on a mans face Amazing what a good nights sleep can do More like a night not sleeping Theres your army My Lord You do your men and Jomsberg proud This will be a great battle Theyll sing songs about the few that went to Trondheim and smashed the armies of the God Men we leave soon before Beothric finds out Forgive us sire We have traitors in our midst Some of our brothers have sided with your brother sire The king is dead The druid What are they to do with only a few hundred men They are the Jomsberg Who knows what theyll do care little Tomorrow shall have the horn and no army in this middle kingdom will be able to stop me The Gates of Valhalla Mittgard and Helheim will swing wide My Lord what is this plan What are you saying shall open the pathway to open the gates of Heaven and Hell It will wreak havoc upon our world care little for your world Thousands of our people will die These people fell our fields build our ships Surely you cannot be unaware of the havoc that this will cause Fool Of course am aware Only by my forging mayhem upon the world can the Christian God be destroyed forever This is not about our Viking quests or extending our realm Its about you and the Gods at the expense of mortals What care have for mortals am a God You may care little My Lord but ll not you lead us into our own destruction You forgot one thing Only those with the blood of Gods can use the weapons of the Gods You Wolfred suffer from a lack of vision Kings of the North prepare your men The battle for the middle kingdom starts at sunrise Captain name you King of Nordland in place of Wolfred So many Your men probe the shield wall right to left and throw our full weight on the left flank once the wall has broke And if we break it Then we push through And if Thor shows up before then ll shall call him out and well fight to the death The eclipse It will begin soon Men we camp here for the night Men of Jomsberg Vikings brothers across the ridge is the army of the north more than a thousand strong We are but a few Five to one If you wish ll ride to their captains and ask for an extra day so they can gather more men It only seems fair Some of you know me Some of you have bled with me Some of you have heard tall tales of battles won of Gods and Goddesses This is me Eirick of Jomsberg and my song is not yet finished The measure of a man is not measured in his battles won the dead by his swords or the gold he has stored away man is measured by his courage his devotion to family his willingness to grab his destiny If we do not fight this day there will be a generation of terror and the Gods will unleash horrors of the old age Today you do not fight for yourself Today you fight for your wives your sons your daughters If you should die this day die with the faith that you have stood shield to shield with your brothers And die as a Viking should with honor Come Follow me Now thats more like it They dont stand a chance against our mighty army Take position To the wall Fire Take cover First wave form a new line Retreat Retreat Come on you bastards Come on Weve broken down the wall Captain but weve lost many of our men We have to win this Well fight to the very end Another captain comes My Lord your brother is dead We pledge ourselves to you in your noble cause Come let us join the fight Sire Speak man Theyve broken to the left Theyve reinforced Lets ride Gregor Were broken Who will tell Thor To hell with him ride to my ships and beyond Stay if you wish Save yourself if you can Youre not Vikings To hell with you too King of Nordland Back to the fortress Retreat Retreat Theres none left for us Fine with me didnt come here to be a casual observer wont let you do it So what now Eirick You cannot stop me Did you come just to see me open the Gates of Helheim may not have the horn but do you see me running ve come to face you Thor and die if must Ah yes The horn By blowing this here you thought to send me back to Valhalla will try You cannot stand against me my son Your father did not know the truth He took after his form to lay with your mother did not need such artifices She was a willing whore to my desires Did you truly believe a mortal man could rise from the dead could drink from a cup of Frey without dying Could lay with the Goddess of Love without being driven insane by desire The blood of the Gods is in your veins My blood is in your veins Yield to me and together we shall rule the world with our fist and we shall drive the one God and his son from the face of the earth will not let you destroy the middle kingdom Then fight No Eirick Your weapon holds no fear for me have the blood of the Gods in me have the blood of the Gods May have the Horn of Helheim Lord Frey Poor Thane of Jomsberg You can blow this until the sea freeze is over but it was never meant to blow Thor away No it was meant for another higher purpose But you said Yes told you only an undead could enter Hell Being Gods both Thor and needed you to obtain this horn You see three relics are needed to open the gates of Heaven Earth and Hell The necklace of Mary Magdalene from Mittgard the Hammer of Thor from Valhalla and the Gilded Horn of Helheim You poor fool The horn is the final key and youve brought it to us Why are you doing this Men Are ungrateful We have protected you for ages then you abandon us for some new God It is time for man to pay the price My son together we could have ruled the world The horns breaking Somethings wrong Why is this happening Because its a fake gave a false horn to Beothric listened to what the earth told me knew your plans Frey And learned you would betray us Nature will always tell the story of a traitor No one God or mortal should rule the earth Brynna Its a good death It shouldve been me No one chooses their fate Youre not responsible for my life or anyone elses Only your own m at peace have a glorious death Send me back to sea Behold Brynna the Fair You see your mother awaiting you in paradise Behold Gregor the Formidable Do you see our kinsmen Behold Warick the Wise Do you see your rest awaiting you in paradise Behold Bernard the Viking His paradise is his honor and family And there see my friends surrounded by those who have gone before For when my time comes shall join them there gladly Such marks the passing of the old Gods from middle kingdom Mankind is now free to choose their Gods their friends their enemies became known as Eirick Thorson My men and have become the guardians of the holy relics Not many know of our existence so our song our song is not yet sung
