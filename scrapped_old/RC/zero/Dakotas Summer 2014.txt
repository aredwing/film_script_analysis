cowgirl with a whole lot of spunk Nice fall Dakota Am missing something Or isnt the rider supposed to stay on the horse Truth is the only reason shes on the Sweethearts is because shes Austin Roses granddaughter Oops not anymore You little troll How dare you What happened to you You used to be so nice and now youre the Wicked Witch of the West It doesnt make any sense You better watch your back Dakota m not afraid of you Come on Shes not worth it What has gotten into you know it was wrong but she deserved it You cant just stoop to her level Dakota You gotta take the high road cant Dakota We feel that you need to take some time off from the Sweethearts to think about whats really important to you Its not fair Dakota we do believe in you You know you say that but feel like you guys dont feel like everyones against me Honey you cant just leave Then what am supposed to do This is all your fault because you lied to me Where exactly are you gonna go The middle of nowhere sounds pretty

help it You like that one OneFoot Flyaway almost did it once Did you Yep Thats a challenging trick You got all your weight supported by just one leg The other leg straight back your arm forward Going miles an hour on a horse ups the degree of difficulty considerably My daddy always said a OneFoot Flyaway took the grace of a ballerina and the strength of a steer wrestler always wondered why wasnt a better trick rider considering was your granddaughter and all But now that m not guess it makes sense Well my daddy was just about the most uncoordinated man in the world He couldnt dance He could barely get up on a horse But oh how he could sing When he opened his mouth and sang you wouldve thought an angel himself had come down to the world to entertain us Beautiful And as for me Well cannot sing a lick And your point is You tell me Well obviously it doesnt matter what your parents did as far as what you can do Its not about blood Its about heart Oh and Dakota Yeah will always be your grandfather Miniature horses are exactly like normal horses just smaller Miniature horses have been bred over the last years Small horses and ponies had been used to work in coal mines in England and

take the baby she would leave the baby on the courthouse steps So took you drove over to Richard and Claras house and carried you inside You were babbling and cooing like you didnt have a care in the world When asked Richard and Clara if theyd be interested in raising you well they didnt hesitate They committed that night to love you and to take care of you forever Now Annie and your father they
