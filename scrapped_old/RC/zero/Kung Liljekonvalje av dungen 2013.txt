Why is that suspicious The shops are located next door Its closed on Sundays Lucky you were here then dont know anything about Anneli Hassels death Who says shes dead The whole towns talking about it

married Youll understand when you get married Your health Dagmar the meatballs were fabulous Did you write this What brides murder solved Journalists already knew wanted to put a stop to the rumours

want to marry me now Why do you say that What is it There are too many whys Why did Anneli say yes to Joakim if she loved Norrgrd He couldnt do anything He was married It doesnt matter They loved each

so quickly Its tragic Unfortunately some things remain unclear Were you in the forest last Friday Lets see now You were actually at home You had a meeting with Egon Power This way must have mixed up the days Anneli was seen running away crying then There must be a connection But why didnt she come to visit What were you and Egon doing Nothing weird We run a small lumber business together him and me Did you speak about something that might have upset her No Not that can recall Anything else No not at the moment can take them dont give mail to third parties No Did you know Anneli Hassel Yes we

Wait Ouch thought itd be easier when the killer was found but No You and Sebastian discussed the lumber business together You had a business meeting on Friday Friday Thats what Sebastian said Was it Well thats enough Between and Anneli was there She heard your conversation and ran away crying away What were you talking about If she heard anything dont think shed understand it Is the lumber business so difficult to understand d say so Youre certainly nice Christer but this is starting to sound like an interrogation Is it Sorry its an occupational hazard So was it Norrgrd Egon Someone called and said the autopsy was finished We can bury Anneli Maybe its better to do it now because we have so many pastries Honey well do exactly what you want Associate Professor Ahlgren Its Christer Wijk heard Anneli Hassels autopsy was finished see Can you say anything about Mats Norrgrd now What did the pathologist say Eavesdropping No you were talking and overheard Yes Norrgrd was probably

too hard on Sebastian His wife of course Gossip spreads like weeds Poor Sebastian First Anneli and then his bad business Didnt he celebrate a deal when he came to the shop on Friday It was thwarted rich man like Joakim Kruse shouldnt bother with business in the middle of grief Is Joakim involved in Sebastians business Want to help Another time Inspector But dear children Come Come and sit How are you Its Eje Hell never forgive me Its clear hell forgive you He deserves someone better Nonsense have rarely seen two people so right for each other What if you kept painting instead of getting married But it was never a sacrifice for me But it is for me Why must choose What are you doing here Its over Huh Puck What She doesnt love me So shes free for now Yes yes go Theres no other woman for me Do you understand what that means Do you understand what it means to love someone Yes do Do you Talk to me about anything but not about her All right Egon and Sebastian run a lumber business together Joakim went into debt with a large sum of money But now hes pulled through again ferreted it out They bought and sold a forest that doesnt exist really ugly business Does Puck own a business What kind of a question is that Youre my best friend And youre mine Do you want another beer Two All right Can have four beers Eje He went in advance Did he Yes Let him be little ve never seen him so angry yesterday He was probably more sad than angry would have been How do you know youre making the right choice Anneli didnt make the right choice She did at the last moment Eje isnt here m sorry Excuse me may ask about your business with Sebastian Pettersson His finances are certainly dodgey dont think so Were in the same business but my income is small potatoes in comparison If youll excuse me Good day Looking for Leo Berggren Christer Wijk then Its very important Now what Theres coffee at Egon and Gretels Welcome cant find Elvira But where is she Shell probably turn up soon Dont worry Gretel Puck and can serve for a while You guys are angels Welcome m sorry Have you seen Elvira Hansson They dont know where she is Thank you Shes looking for you and me It was important When did she call During the funeral got the analysis of the towel from the laundry It contained blood Helena dont understand why Elvira put on this table cloth Its not even ironed No one will notice it It looks terrible ll straighten out some questions around Annelis death But Christer this is Annelis commemoration Lets remember her Anneli was on the way to give you the keys Tell what you and Egon were talking about or ll report you for shady transactions Everything will come out If it werent for Anneli Joakim would never have invested And then it would have gone to hell for us About the forest It went like that anyway She met her old lover who she was just about to forget But this spring a letter came from the guy in question Fortunately collected the mail that day Then another letter came intercepted it If Anneli read the letter shed never say yes to Joakim Kruse She was going to marry for me To save me Did you know she said yes to save her stepfathers finances No Did you know Mats Norrgrd knew she had an unfortunate love affair but she didnt talk about it She associated him with lilies of the valley So the bridal bouquet was a sort of test You didnt know she received a letter from Mats Norrgrd No But knew it when saw lilies of the valley in her bag You saw her on Saturday morning when you were out walking She lay there She lay there so still and beautiful And peaceful And then you put the flowers in her hands Yes it was my way of saying goodbye What was Anneli doing the last time you saw her Did you discover someone betrayed you Not anyone but someone you cared for When found out everything just snapped Besides Joakim there was also Dina Egon and Gretel Anneli went home to make up with all of you Could She confronted you You didnt plan to kill her though Are you crazy Do you understand what youre saying You had to remove the body before Gretel woke up You were afraid someone would see you so you left the corpse on the ground and got a clean knife from the laundry Sure Then went out into the woods and hung Norrgrd up in a tree Yes You saw the chance of blaming him You stole LarsOves car keys and Fannys clothesline and went to Hammarby Forest Then it was Elviras turn What Elvira She didnt get hold of us before she bumped into you Egon need to talk to the gentleman What happened Elvira Elvira m looking right at her Going to the laundry looking for another table cloth The blood stains came from your clothes when you hastily hid them in the linen closet You should just as well confess It would probably suit you just fine But you have no proof for your falsehoods How could have killed Anneli loved Anneli But not like a father Thats why you took the letters It hadnt anything to do with business Suddenly she was just there Why did you take my letter Where were you told him You comforted me trusted you protected you was the one who protected you was willing to marry a man didnt love to save you Because you love me just like love you You disgust me wont come back as long as you live here What are you doing Get off me Calm down No m so sorry Eje But cant marry you cant give up my dreams and my studies want to finish my Ph and hate washing cooking and ironing dont even know if want children love you But dont want to live as a housewife Do you love me Of course just cant give up so many important things But then we do something

because love you Everything else well solve Well solve it together Moreover do you think d let you loose in our kitchen d rather go out to eat every night Hows it going Its fine Have you got puncture
