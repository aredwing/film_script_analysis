rooftop It suggested a connection The last time Bourne came back he exposed the Black Briar program It compromised active operations The asset was in Syria under cover He was captured tortured And took two damn years to get him out So you think thats why Bourne wants the files To go public again have no idea why he came back But whatever hes doing he wants to destroy us We cant let that happen So please give me a call soon as you hear anything Yes sir Treadstone IronHand Richard Webb Involved Under surveillance And now the founder and chairman of Aaron Kalloor Ahh you all know why youre here We will be unveiling a new platform We think it is a bold new step to allow us to serve our community better Were a community right now thats trascending national boundaries and think were at Billion users You know we have an ecosystem of hundreds of thousands of apps at this point And what this new platform will do is to integrate Users data and preferences And use that information to enrich and tailormake Each unique user experience in a way that is frankly Unprecedented Now can see some journalists pens twitching ready to ask about privacy This is a concern of many people and so it should be This is something that matters to us and let me just say understand nobody wants to feel like theyre being watched So let just tell you when you come to when you use our service Noone will be watching you Enjoy your meal Thank you Congratulations hear you stockholders were very happy with the new platform And heard you got hacked Were dealing with it This changes everything Theres too much risk m out Hey You are an extraordinarily gifted and perceptive young man And you agreed to help us its because you understood the very grave threats Do you have idea the shitstorm on our hands if this arrangement goes public already took a hit with Snowden and you want more Our enemies have become much more sophisticated Gathering metadata is no longer adequate We need a backdoor into your new platform and a way Past the encryptions When thats not enough you want something new You you dont get it do you Privacy is is freedom believe thats something you should think about defending You little prick you didnt believe in privacy or freedom when When we funded your start up and turned you into a billionaire have paid you back many many many times over And was never comfortable with any of this m out m done selling out our customers Yet you would sell out your country The truth is we wouldnt be having this conversation if you didnt feel Personally at risk You talk about a free internet you tell yourself youre saving the world All youre doing is making it a much more dangerous place And you sure as hell Making this country much more difficult to defend And youre sure as hell accountable for that Oi everything on the table Open it Sure Bournes surfaced In Berlin Get the Berlin team out Where is she She is dead She knew the risks warned her She made a choice You exploited her Blue Team is mobile What do we have on the location Its an address linked to Christian Dassault Anything on Bourne Nothing yet m accessing now Sir ve been thinking Maybe we got this wrong What if hes not coming for us What if its something else You dont have any idea of who youre dealing with We should work together more We both want the same thing right You exposed the Black Briar program We both want to take down the corrupt institutions that control society m not on your side feed is online Hes on a computer We have to stop this He puts those files online Operations will be compromised and people will die Yes sir At least when youre done leave me the files These programs have to be exposed People have a right to know proposal by Richard Web We need that computer Theres a phone in

the old Treadstone files Were you tracing you history know youre looking for something Let me help you find it Give me that phone Yes sir Jason this is Robert Dewey Do you remember me Jason your Dad was a patriot He could see the threats Americas facing and like you He chose to serve his country out of a profound sense of duty He would not want to see you harm the Agency You have to stop this And you have to stop it now You We lost him sir Malcom Smith contractonly based out of London Ran all of Tradestones surveillance in the late s when Bourne was recruited Is he still active Hes private security now Contact the asset and tell him want him on the ground and loaded in hours think that could be a mistake sir mitake why Theres an argument for catching Bourne instead of killing him Alright lets hear it Bournes been off the grid for a long time Hes been hiding in the shadows Hes seen things He knows things that could help us Bringing him back in is the smart move And how are we going to do that Albert Herchtz did an evaluation on Bourne when he left the program He concluded Bourne is still a patriot at heart And that leaving the program could come back to haunt him And whatre you suggesting watched Bourne with those files Desperately looking into his past and think hes had a If can get face to face with him think can bring him back in One attempt And if it fails You do what you have to Well it makes sense to me What do you think Bob Lets give it a shot Alright do it Bring Bourne in Or tie it off This ends now Thank you sir Sir m sorry No no dont Better get some
