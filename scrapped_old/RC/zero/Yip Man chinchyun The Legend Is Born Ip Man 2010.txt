a drug store kid Which is better to treat bruises powder or ointment What Hes injured What happened fight What else Who beat him did thought he was your friend Thats how we became friends Why did you beat him Boss why dont you Why dont you bring him here Here to receive treatment Treatment Bring him here so can beat him too Make sure he wont call us Chinese pigs again Where did you learn about that From your friends You and your name are known to everybody on this street now Ip Man Youre popular kid So youre studying Wing Chun Authentic Wing Chun The name was inherited from the school taught by Master Leung Jan from Foshan So you must be one of Chins Nickname of Chan Wah Shun Disciples Correct Authentic my foot So much so that you made me believe you learned directly from Master Ng Mui How long have you studied it Finished the lower body strength training yet What about targeted finger Youre in Wing Chun too boss First told you m not the boss m the manager here Second am practicing Wing Chun but dont know if its considered authentic Do you want to try it out Next time might be too busy next time If you want to try me try me now Better not if there is any injury Are you looking down on old folks like me Come on Mr Manager Hasn t your master taught you that when practicing with the others you reserve only the strength applied not the skill What despise me mean business then Are you alright kid m fine Well again Watch my medicine Be careful with the ThreePrick Wine Wait You call this Wing Chun Whatever comes from my fist is Wing Chun They are not Wing Chun My Master said Wing Chun strategic movements are from the hands attacking an opponents lower body Your master wasnt wrong The traditional focus is on the use of the hands But that doesnt mean it forbids changes Changes allow more flexibility Movements can be adapted in multiple ways such as leg movements in a form of wrestling and they all work May know your name please m Leung Bik from Foshan People call me Sir Bik Master Leung Jan was my father Youre my senior So is my Wing Chun authentic Youre funny Come back the day after tomorrow kid Come here the day after tomorrow Dont you want lessons Of course do But cant afford to pay you Did ask you to pay Customs inspection Open the crates officers Hold it Inspection is not authorized The medicine was purchased from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce by the British Embassy Mr Kitano said you cant open this as it was purchased from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce by the British Embassy dont understand English How dare a lowranking customs officer display public contempt for the Japanese business bureau Should any damage be incurred who will be held responsible How dare a lowranking customs officer like you display public contempt for the Japanese business bureau Should any damage be incurred who will be held responsible If smuggling is going on who will be held responsible then Officers open the crates Mr Kitano said you cant open this Stop What do you think youre doing Do you know who this gentleman is Do you know how much Mr Kitano donates to Foshan every year My apologies Mr Kitano You may take the goods Whatre you standing here for Clear the way Of course welcome donations But if they are from the Japanese will definitely decline Why did you make such a comment Chairman Japans evil intentions became apparent after the RussoJapanese War they annexed our territory and built the Manchurian Railway aiming at economic invasion Look at what they did in the NorthEast their ambitions are obvious think understand how the Chairman feels But the thing is the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Foshan did not participate in the NorthEastern affair Mr Kitano came here only to do business not much different from other foreign investors So think we should treat his donation the same way as others dont believe the Japanese would make a donation without a personal agenda Well after hes done business for so long in Foshan this could probably be his gesture of retuning a favor Dont be suspicious Youre in business too Tin Chi Why dont you tell us what you think as a newcomer tend to agree with what Chairman Lee suggested After all ourAssociation is on very sound financial ground and is not urgently in need of donations Tin Chi m going back to the school See you later Try to talk Chairman Lee out of being so stubborn Tin Chi Mr Mayor we are all educated people Why should we allow the uneducated to upset us You are right Goodbye Take care Bye The improved version of Wing Chun is the good use ofdistant fist near elbow close wrestling incorporating long and short distance movements Wing Chun wrestling uses the reverse joint principle no need to hold on to your opponent Your Master concentrated on the long stretch and low kick My improved version of Wing Chun incorporates the short stretch and high kick Wing Chun should not be described as authentic or nonauthentic anymore To me Wing Chun is one big family there is no distinction between you me and him Goodbye Man Ip Our surname goes first Reverend Ip Man all the best Same to you goodbye Goodbye Lets go Bye Bye Goodbye Bye Thank you Thank you You should have told me you were coming back Ip Man Mei Wai Ip Mans back everybody You brought back so many things Only this one is mine the rest are presents for you all We know Ip Man is good to us This is for you For me How am supposed to finish all these toffees Dont eat them all some are for my brother to sell Man Tin Chis back Brother There you are Yes Long time no see Youre still stout Keeping up with martial arts practice Do you want to try me Sure Give it to me One point for Man Great Another point for you Man What style is this Wing Chun The high kick doesnt exist in Wing Chun where did you pick that up Try me more first Good One point for Tin Chi Excellent Good Dont tell me this is Wing Chun Man This is fantastic Show me Ip Man Its wonderful Teach me too Me too Me first One at a time Mei Wai watch out Is this necessary Man m all right Take it easy next time Take a rest Mei Wai Lets learn it together To reward your enthusiasm Come on Alright Amazing This focuses on the reverse joint principle Its a different approach like Japanese Judo theres no need to hold on to your opponent Its amazing want to learn too Me too Count me in Brother Chung So Brother Chung So Let me help you Such a fat chicken let me take care of it Remember what Master Chan said to you Man Time to go home Lets go ask you Whose style is authentic our Master Chans or Leung Biks Leung Bik Brother Chung So Mr Leung and our Master are from the same school his style shouldnt be considered deviant from authenticity Also Leung Bik is Grand Master Leung Jans son he practiced with him since he was a child But he never got along with the Grand Master nor with his brothers Leung Bik is conceited Perhaps he held different views Despite a difference in views he shouldnt have created tension in the family remember after the Grand Master passed away Biks brother immendiately put up a wall to partition the two families you can see how badly he was received by the others Hes a bit strange but we cant assume that his art is not competent People often thought that Wing Chun seldom uses wrestling moves But he believes that by applying the targeted finger style or darting hand movements opponents can be overpowered ve tried it and its very effective Comparing Biks with the tradional moves his allow more flexibility Let me tell you the Wing Chun Leung Bik has learned only accounts for a fraction of his fathers Most of his movements are made up How can one improve without deconstructing the old You are greedy to aspire for more before you can manage the basic Wing Chun principles Youll end up gaining nothing m fed up Enjoy your meal Dont get upset Brother Chung So Man just got back give him a chance Fine He has his chance now Show me the sort of deviance youve picked up Get up up Brother Chung So Brother Chung So Ip Man Brother Chung So Stay away What happened to the things Leung Bik taught you Brother Chung So Man Ip man should be feeling sorry by now Brother Chung So thats enough Was it Wing Chun that he just demonstrated Does our school have high kick like that Or elbow as low as his Now demand you all go on your knees in front of our master and vow that you will never again learn anything that deviates from our school tradition They have nothing to do with this Brother Chung So It was me who wanted to try things out They never said they wanted to learn it from me m the only one who deserves punishment for this have taught you all know Man Thank you Master Stop calling me master Why Your master is Chan Wah Shun you have to show due respect When was young was too emotional to try to think from anothers perspective And my family was too conservative to accept my innovative ideas thus causing a lot of misunderstanding and friction In order to aviod conflict decided to leave Foshan Ip Man is gifted but hes such an ungrateful brat Do you think should expel him Please give me instruction Master If you think should please show the head when toss the coin Master Ip Man is young and restless hes doomed to make some mistakes And perhaps its not entirely his fault might not be competent enough as an instructor Why dont we do it three times to decide on the result Thanks Master Thanks Master thanks a great deal You are We heard that your Association has a reputation for the vision of promoting martial arts on the grounds of abolishing segregation of schools So were here to join the Association m glad that you share the same vision How may address you Before we enroll d like to see whether the Association is qualified to teach us dont quite understand what you mean You need to show a sample when you sell goods So wed like to check out how competent the masters are first This is not how our Association operates Dont make things difficult All right then If you dont want to demonstate well be happy to take over You just came to create trouble Hold it Wait a minute Father Chairman Kitano what do you want from us Not much only want to say hello dont think so its more like picking a fight This is a place to learn martial arts dont see why not Chairman Lee allow me Good Good fight

here now Tin Chi Tin Chi beg your forgiveness Master ve failed as a teacher and a leader Yiu Choi Yiu Choi Master Ip Tin Chi you traitor Thats no way to treat your fellow disciples Watch out Man will Kill him Clear the way beat you up not in revenge for being framed But to defend Lee Man Ho the Master and Dads reputation Why did you turn traitor when you were so loved and respected by us m not a traitor m a Japanese sergeant Tanaka Eiketsu left my parents when was twelve to become a spy in China miss my country want to go home couldnt even see my mother when she died have yet to be able to pay my respects at her grave It might not be a bad idea to die now so everything can be ended m a soldier which leaves me no choice m relieved now as ve finally carried out my mission dont need to hurt the people love any more Its been a pleasure to be adopted by the Ip family and be your brother have no regrets as Mei Wai has been my wife Wheres Mei Wai now Ip Man The essence of Wing Chun is to follow ones shadow not his hand Focus on what you feel rather than what you see Wheres Tin Chi feel guilty wasnt able to keep his son Captain these crates have just arrived They are all Kitanos Open them for inspection Where am Who are you want to go home Theres one over here too Help him out Over here too Any water Give them some Will do Easy get him out Dad a beggar is unconscious outside Dont be afraid Leave Give them some water At the critical moment he arrived in a hurry with a long rod in hand beating the hell out of the Japanese with the authentic Wing Chun halfpast six rod style However his rod was slashed into two halves by your Uncle Tin Chis Japanese sword Yet Tin Chi didnt let go he pressed even harder by attacking Ip Man with Karate and Judo How did my Dad react He was very alert he immediately used the two half rods like a pair of wingshaped swords and brandished them frantically at times mixing in some unknown styles styles difficult to identify to beat his opponent These mixed movements regardless of their authenticity were not only powerful enough to win but also good enough to save my life From then on stopped believing that martial arts schools should be segregated to maintain their own authentic styles My eyes were opened and saw a broader horizon dont understand how Uncle Tin Chi picked up Japanese Kung Fu Yeah Why Why As a matter of fact your Uncle Tin Chi Why stop practicing Dad Go and do more training and practice Hurry Hurry Lets go and practice Telling stories again Brother Chung So Youve gone over them thousands of times The thing is every time its a new story to them Youre right Children should know about their past Pay full attention when you practice You are not allowed to eat before youre done Dinners ready Jun Stop
