our ideas agitating the workers against us You must talk about it to Woeste You do it There he is Have you read it Mr Chairman m aware my friends will bring reason to that little printer Its going too far Aalst is getting more dangerous by the day They insult and loot us and threaten our women They terrorise the country and this newspaper Dont exaggerate Druw Do Lets not waste our time That paper can handle These workers shouldnt bite the hands that feed them The church should take care of that As an employer you take care of their of salvation too You dont know these workers They have the same worries as us directors How many factories will survive the crisis in Aalst If the government wont subsidize me will close down There will be no subvention But you promised My colleagues in the government dont want state intervention The recommend the English method Limit production costs to enable competition Lower the wages Thats impossible Its not pay them franc for hours work Cumont pays franc for hours And hes still complaining hes going to go down If we all draw the line they even will accept franc While a loaf of bread costs centimes and a bag of coal Pay them with potatoes Why not The money goes to booze anyway They wont survive They also wont survive if the factories closes Poverty is not the problem agree with that But to me its dangerous to lower the wages now People are already upset We could implement the Scottish system Three workers to four machines And if we only let the women work we safe half You cant mean that Its an interesting idea The Scots still do it as well Three female worker to four machines Are there not enough accidents already How many fatal accidents have you got And you Antoine And you lot Safe us your demagogy In every war there will be casualties You are monsters The lot of you We liberals stand up for our workers who live in total poverty No aid from you and Aalst loses its industry and you your constituents m sorry to interrupt Mr

meal In the name of the Father and the son and the Holy Ghost Amen potato Father Or a cup of coffee Thanks Theyre Polders Nora is a good cook Enjoy yourself Now that youre here Father may ask you something What would you do For years you work for a director through thick and thin Shut up All these years you walk in his beautiful procession his procession for St Ursula And then suddenly he says Get out What would you do Father Youd still go to his procession Not me No Father not me Provided his sermon is decent and deals with higher ideas nothing actually opposes a priest to share with a large audience But Father Daens sermon is of shocking triviality and regret to say is revealing a shameful demagogy Quite right Mr Woeste quite right But after all this subject is only inspired on Rerum Novarum and on paternal preoccupations of his holiness Leon for the condition of the workers This encyclical doesnt mention the stirring of the workers against those who feed them Now Daens has created such suspicion that the government considers to send an investigation committee to Aalst What a triumph for our enemies On the contrary Mr Woeste If as you say we are talking about slander an inquest will prove that Father Daens is wrong word from you would suffice to reduce him to silence Father Daens is careless Mr Woeste Buthe has a brilliant mind and in that case m not sure that a remonstration is enough Monseigneur you have other means than a mere remonstration to ensure his obedience When a priest uses his cloth to spread hostilities it can be taken away Mr Woeste m afraid that only the ecclesiastic authorities are capable to judge this Of course Monseigneur But you must understand me came in everybodys interest to avoid this matter from going beyond this diocese and leading us to appeal to higher instances An energetic cure at the right moment can prevent complications Dont you agree understand you perfectly my son An investigation committee in the factories of Aalst An investigation committee in the factories of Aalst Read The Worker Read Father Daens new article Read The Worker The paper of good Catholics Read Forwards The real paper for the worker Large

and his magical salts constipation is a thing of the past Thats not what it says No Who can read You or me Then read us Daens article Here is your article Common sense has prevailed The government has decided that a committee of honourable personalities will investigate the factories of Aalst They will be able to interrogate the workers directly Surely you dont believe what the priest says that theyll listen Theyre all the directors friends If you want respect from them you must change the government Hence the parliament first But since we dont have a say in parliament we need voting rights first Who are you to criticize Daens There is no one like him in Ghent Your priest says the same as we do But we did it first So loud that we didnt hear it Besides Daens is in our paper and not in yours you red cabbage This committee only comes to eat No potatoes but fat steaks What That Daens is a saint He will change the factories Priests are sly and change nothing You dont know what a committee is We socialists demanded francs for hours So what Daens asked francs for hours You wise ass The riddle has been solved by a great catholic Put all your children to work Theyll never get ill

Officer What do you want We want to see the committee Gentlemen please come these way You can come along if you like They have a dead child commander Take it from them But Execution Yes commander Charge Oh no Where is Milleke Its coming from Mijlenbeeck Hey no Stop Look what youve done Fool Look what youve done Get out of here Get lost Get out suggested to Stillemans that you give a sermon on Rerum Novarum but he insisted that do it Have you read my sermon Yes What do you think Very bad The gospel we just heard is telling us about the multiplication of the bread and fish Lots of them hundreds thousands of them women and children rich and poor had followed Christ and had been listening to Him When the evening came the apostles asked him to send the crowd home or to the surrounded villages to find food and shelter And he said Why dont you feed them They told him there was barely enough for themselves He looked reproachfully at them asked the people to sit looked towards heaven blessed the loaves of bread and the fish and had his disciples share them There were people They all ate They all had their fill Dearly beloved if Christ teaches us that it is our duty to share without prejudice of rank or class if he gives away the little food he has to perfect strangers then why shouldnt this be the duty of the Belgian bourgeois class toward the poor who they know Who work for them Or do these people who claim to be faithful servants of the pope think that the gospel is not meant for French ears because it is written in Latin People scream Were hungry Loud and clear And these words should not be thrown to the wind It is time the voices of the poor were heard in this country Besides my dear friends how come the voice of the rich is always much louder than a poor mans Why is a poor mans vote worth less than a rich mans Who has a right to say you are good and you are bad you can vote and you cannot Unbelievable He preaches universal suffrage Gentlemen directors What does the pope whom you like to quote so much what does he say in his encyclical Rerum Novarum We are convinced that we should improve the fate of the lower class because a large part of them live in undeserved misery My dear friends it is clear that our Holy Father Pope Leo and Christ are speaking the same language and that an end should be put to this organised established injustice And remember my friends you dont have anything It is not you who have to share but those who have just left this church How can you be so clumsy Thanks to your brutality Daens has all the trumps Be more clever with you workers Give them soup knit them scarves That will make us popular The pope wants more charity Thats the right policy m not sure thats enough The situation is too serious They demand the universal suffrage Theyll never have it m sorry but a lot of people think otherwise Half of the factories are striking for the universal suffrage The agitation is such that it would be a miracle if Aalst escapes this revolution Mr Woeste the strikers find support everywhere even within our own party Father Daens runs a campaign for the universal suffrage within our party Throw him out Him his brother and the others No thats not enough That would turn him into a martyr Theres only one way to finish him unfrock him In civil clothes this priest will be a nobody ll go all the way to the Vatican Not in that thing you wont Very funny We must be aware that many workers will turn their back on the Church More so the reason not to hesitate and to be firm to Daens d love to but wont be degraded to Mr Woestes errand boy Send Daens to the Congo Theyre short of missionaries Then Daens will choose for the blacks and everyone will return know Daens Hurry up Willem have work to do Sorry Monseigneur the only solution here might be a prayer Arise ye wretched of the earth Monseigneur This is the result of your reckless talk Father Daens You are a priest to spread Gods word not the socialists If there is inequality on earth it is because God wants it wouldnt say that You reason like Woeste He turns God into a Belgian and bars everyone who doesnt belong to his Belgian heaven Quiet Daens havent asked you here to discuss politics Once more you embarrass me with your difficult character Instead of visiting pubs in your robe dont you think you should look at yourself and try to find out whether all this popularity doesnt stem from the pursuit of pure vanity You dont listen to anybody because you want them to listen to you That is not the issue The seriousness of the situation in Aalst escapes you You and are facing hard times Flanders is lost if Aalst becomes red Thats what catholic workers think You are stumbling over your own brains To give you a chance to do penance for this you will temporarily celebrate the mass in solitude forbid you to preach in SintMartinus church again Dont do that Monseigneur beg you Kneel so that can bless you More No or therell be nothing left for the little ones Let them work if they want to eat m on strike Lazy Ask Louis Louis is a rat Dont speak about him like that You dont work either Dont talk to father like that You shut up too youre on strike Give it back you cant do that Its for Jannes Give that potato back Enough If thats how it is theres free soup at the factory Sit down you We only eat what we work for That soup is for the poor We are poor Dad Worker or striker dont work Go away work Why dont they get anything You only get soup if you work Do you think m crazy Do you think we feed the reds That soup is poison Belgium strikes We must join them Do you want them to laugh at us That soup is to break the strike We the socialist are giving soup to everybody Real good Aalst onion soup for everyone Dont believe them Who wants some Dont eat it Its pagan soup Dont believe them Lets all strike Strike for the universal suffrage think hes right We must carry on the strike Theyll think youre red too dont care m hungry Who else m sure Daens supports the strike He should say so But hes gone Youll never see him again believe me Where is Daens Father priest is like a soldier He goes where God needs him want to know where Daens is Youre hiding him Ridiculous Then were is Daens Now now friends Leave the Father alone want to know where Daens is Where is Daens Schmitt no more soup No soup for strikers Louis Have you gone made Leave that kid alone you idiot Wheres the soup But Elizabeth Wasnt that soup for everyone Long live the strike And the universal suffrage Not enough salt One million more votes Thats preposterous You insult the people Gentlemen little dignity please The vote is closed ll read to you the result of the vote on the law proposal from Mr Nyssens on the introduction in Belgium of plural suffrage Have voted in favour Have voted against Abstentions The proposal has been accepted Adolf Something wrong m looking for a nice Christian Peoples Party Program Here before youre covered with ink How many will we print Thirty thousand To start with And one for Woeste In gold Well be the biggest party in Aalst Theres room on Woeste You fought for the highest right of man on this earth The right to speak freely And you won From now on you too will decide what your and your kids future will look like The socialists Go on Father Its good folk that come to listen Friends know your children are starving that you hardly ever eat meat that they pay you with wet coals But does that surprise us No because for years the catholic party has oppressed the workers and pushed them into misery deaf to their cries of despair Comrades shall we once and for all throw off the catholic yoke and finally have our own say Yes Comrades For that unfortunately we are not yet strong enough Friends We the liberals are not strong enough either Therefore we propose to join us and vote for Daens Against the Catholics Long live Father Daens And the socialists And the liberals Friends From today you wont have to fear You wont have to fear that your voice wont be heard If injustice is guaranteed by the law then the people must rise and with a swift kick throw over all this crap and injustice Its every workmans duty to support each other in the struggle for a decent life Sorry for this building site Mr Woeste but a king must continually built his kingdom mustnt he hope your family is well Very well Your Majesty It seems the universal suffrage was inevitable So be it What do you propose as a remedy stronger catholic unity sire and more firmness from the priests Eventually the red demagogy might endanger your throne To fight their influence we have the church but it doesnt support us enough Cardinal Goossens has arrived Let him in What a coincidence We talk about Churchs problems and Goossens asks for an audience Should we see him Its up to you Your Majesty Very well Come in Monseigneur We were just discussing Mr Woeste and me a subject that concerns you Father Daens suppose understand that Mr Woeste feels very strongly about that priest becoming elected take the opportunity to answer him that nothing in the canon law permits us to forbid a priest to run for election Of course but as recall a priest must obey his bishop if he forbids him to present himself That may be but its up to the bishop and only him Come now could a little priest present such a danger No Sire will solve this problem somehow Great One two three four five You must count five letters Not six just five Otherwise you vote for Woeste Or do you vote for the directors So count five letters as many as the fingers of one hand Six Mr Woeste himself honours you with his presence warm applause for him and his great sausages Good evening Long live Woeste our voice in parliament Who wants this gorgeous sausage With a nice glass of beer Drinks are on us Theyre good sausages Thank you Mr Woeste Can have a sausage Sausage Saucisse Of course Give him one Here cant vote anyway Yes very well on the th of September in they climbed in Wolverhampton in their balloon to a height of metres where they measured Today is election day for the Belgian parliament All Belgians older than must vote Dont forget Voting for Daens is a morale sin Youll go to hell if you do The catholic party protects faith So remember to vote for Mr Woeste God bless you Voting for Daens is against God It leads you straight to the devil Scholliers Voting for Daens is a mortal sin The catholic party protects our faith So remember its Mr Woeste who deserves your vote Bless you my child Whos that Dont believe what he says Are you voting for the rich Are you deaf Voting for Daens is a mortal sin They say hes not a real priest They say he has a wife Who says so Louis Theyre all lies Dont you believe that slander Vote for Daens Otherwise nothing will change Heres my salary How many letters in Daens Six Five letters Dad Invalid Invalid Yes Just as we thought Adolf We checked everything There are hundreds of forms too many That bastard Woeste let all the dead of Aalst vote We were able to reject the Daens brothers objections concerning your campaign for now Mr Woeste The charges of corruption or violence werent withheld But we cant ignore the figures They cant be published There were far too many bulletins in the ballot boxes Because of this blunder well have to start the vote all over again Believe me Mr Woeste we dont have a choice Daenshas been elected Daenshas been elected What Daenshas been elected Daenshas been elected Really Anna give them to mama Thank you Now go and tell them in parliament that we are good people Yes and tell them were hungry Tell them who theyre dealing with Long live Daens So Father you finally found a parish My dear friend its a pleasure to have you as my parishioner Father Daens the delegate of Aalst will now speak Well lets hear him ll speak in French because understand Mr Woeste is not yet advanced enough in the Flemish language to understand my statement Mr Woeste is accusing me of lying concerning the poor of Aalst According to him there are only and this honourable member who is always afraid of being too indulgent calls even this figure exaggerated Dont put words in my mouth You quote me incompletely Two lines written by a man can hang him Oh but there are more lines They come from official documents We know this kind of documents Theyre secret documents only for the use of Mr Woeste and friends Thats not true Please enough Sit down m only beginning Yes go on Mr Woeste have here the real official documents from the Public Administration according to which the register of the poor contains needy Its still more optimistic than reality want to explain Mr President Calm down Mr Woeste You also must explain why d be lying about the workers wages said they were making francs a week you questioned that You were right they dont make francs but only nine And if should believe a letter from Ninove they only make to francs But Mr Woeste doesnt know all this because he has never set foot in a workers home in Aalst He prefers to stay on the balcony of the town hall with the workers at his feet hoping for a sausage or a beer Finally allow me to tell you this was walking along the Dender when a woman came up to me She asked me for alms Her husband was out of work She had four children a year old girl being the eldest who had finally found work in a cotton factory where she had to work underfed from am till pm in an unhealthy atmosphere Barefoot in tepid water Welldo you know how much this young girl who in these winter temperatures must be literally frozen takes home Fifty centimes per day Per day Well ask you gentlemen knowing that at the age of this girl will be worn out because of this slave labour when in turn shell be a mother herself wont she curse her fate Wont she curse the society and the civilization we are so proud of Unity my friends Unity The Holy Father who represent here believes that the greatest danger menacing the catholic world now is disunion Unfortunately have to admit that Father Daens is succeeding is creating dissensions even amongst you And who is the guiltiest of these dissensions Mr Nuncio Father Daens who suggested an alliance or Mr Woeste who has rejected it The Church is cautious It owes a lot to Mr Woeste Within the actual disorder and the growing threat of socialism men like Mr Woeste have to be spared This attitude is hard to conciliate with the evolutionary thoughts of Rerum Novarum Rerum Novarum is a general guideline aiming to promote the evolution of spirits on a long term basis By using it as a weapon against the catholic party Father Daens is using it without consideration That is what tried to make him understand Monseigneur Now fear it may be too late Father Daens is a political man now and every initiative against him taken by the Belgian episcopate could be misinterpreted Let us not underestimate his popularity Youre right agree with you But in that case who could decide The Holy Father himself Youre sure If the Holy Father penalizes Daens we will lose all the catholic workers But if he receives Daens without penalizing him what a publicity for Daens Well gentlemen let the Holy Father decide all this for himself No Your turn Monseigneur Its done The Belgian episcopate passed on the decision to the Holy Father Good Its been a long time since requested his Holiness blessing Father For you they just brought it in Well have to go to Rome immediately What The pope wishes to see you Adolf This is our chance Hey hadnt you better take the train to Rome or dont you know Daens has taken off with Nette Having coffee with the pope Are you wearing this posh suit for Sunday mass brought you something Youll see that our bread is at least as good as in Aalst suppose you need something You dont have to blush thought thought we might get married That is if you want to They certainly move fast in Ghent Or is there something else No or yes that too We could live in Ghent and you wouldnt have to work in the factory see would be marrying a socialist would agree with the church if Daens performs the mass and the Forwards band plays for us My father plays for St Cecilia Could be nice with the two bands Come on lets go One beer Thats mine You cant afford it Oh yes can You have no job have a job No more All swines that voted for Daens are fired Fool cant vote m too young Doesnt matter ll tell Daens You wont see Daens anymore Hes stuck in Rome In a prison for crazy priests Make yourself comfortable Thanks Reverend Daens His Holiness cant see you today Come back tomorrow same time m sorry but understood that my convocation was urgent Is there no mistake am sorry Even with

right All right m gone Damn it For ever And forget about my wages She can walk the streets like all Daens women Go to bed you What happened Was it Schmitt Father Daens please Monseigneur His Holiness sends you this dont understand Yet you understand Latin Excuse me You must do everything to promote piety slant your speeches towards justice love and cautiousness Your dignity and honour as a priest must prevail Dont mix with those who want to overthrow society and avoid to cause any dissension within the catholic party Thats clear enough isnt it understood but this is wrong What do you mean wrong The Church is telling you keep away from the socialists Or else it will abandon you must see his Holiness must speak to him about our workers m sure he doesnt know their real situation in my country must explain it to him Adolf Send them home wont see anyone Youre crazy They come for you Pieter The pope didnt see me Father what did the pope say Dear friends am grateful for your affection In Rome have accomplished important things We will fight on together and achieve the ideas expressed in the encyclical of the pope But unity should go along with justice One cant occur without the other You can always rely on me in life and death ve been told the workers should go to school What for What do they really got out of it To be able to read papers like that one for instance Papers that confirm that a certain priest had an audience by the pope Whilst in the first place this priest was summoned to Rome for disciplinary reasons and secondly according to trustworthy sources at the Vatican has never had the honour of being personally admonished by the pope And these very same liars want to teach us a lesson in morals whilst acting as if they were upholding virtue and religion Mr President wish to speak Ask the pope Let him talk Respect your priests Mister Daens you have seen who your friends are My dear parishioners it is our great regret that we have to ban the writings by the Daens brothers for all of you Or we will lose our eternal soul Dear parishioners let us pray that this ban imposed by our dear bishop may lead our lost sheep back to the right trail Nette is ill We need money urgently Adolf Your allowance is enough for food but it cant support a party Well have to get organized like the socialists with our own bakery own weaving mill and even a savings bank so people get paid even when ill Pieter thats not the problem now got orders The pope wants me to resign Thats impossible All these people fought for you and voted for you These people fought for a cause like you and not for a person My superiors force me to silence but that doesnt ruin the cause Without you it will you know it Pier want some more Friends just met the socialists Their
