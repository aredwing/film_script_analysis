On a night he said that it was enough eight deliveries and still no elixir You lied You have no secret no elixir Noting You are evil itself More need more No It is enough need more That night he told

himself in the mask loses his soul Open up have to talk to you sir What are you doing here Etienne Boisset Biograph of Vidocq m investigating his death That is the best Get that man Tell us what you are doing here My men talked about someone like you man who walked on the street Sir look What did i told you Vidocq researched the alchemyest Damned He exist It is no legend ll explain It is clear verry clear Vidocq chased the alchemyest and the alchemyest pushed him in the pit maybe What ells Laten we de zaken nog eens op een rij zetten Imagine that the alchemyest is the one behind the lightning And that the alchemyest is Vidocq himself dont understand it The lightning the murders the mask Didnt somebody else commited that before And that also explains these instruments and the mask here not And Vidocq himself fell in the pit Listen Or he setted up his own dead Whe only found a pile of ashes It is a bautifull end for a manipulating villan Allow me sir but that sounds to complicated Listen Listen Vidocq and the alchemyest are two different persons ve got prove It seems he knows his case well Which prove Let me go Vidocq battled with the alchemyest when Laffite died have a witness And all those instruments Vidocq is a scientist He worked on a paper formula And that ls that for the decoration Who says the alchemyest is one person You are crazy There can be two thiefs behind the mask Vidocq and the other monster Nimier for example You are crazy No nevermind Its alright Do you take prove Take it easy okay And calm down now what does this has to mean Where do you come from He carries a mirror Doesnt he On the place of his face there is a mirror How did you escaped How What did he do What does he do with de girls What does he do Where is his lab Where is his lab What dirty tricks Bastard know the secret of the monster The mirror is alive The mask is an energiereceptor Some kind of pump The alchemyest steals the souls on the moment that he Killes his fictem He locks them up trough his mask and he feeds himself with it so he doent get older The achemyest uses the virginity blood for the glass of the mirror It is the pureness of the blood that gives him life If im right i know where he is The killer doesnt make the mask himself only the material Hij has an accomplice glasscraftsman know where he is In the glassblazery of the arsenal And asshole
