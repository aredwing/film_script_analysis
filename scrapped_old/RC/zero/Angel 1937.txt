his mind Do you know where he met her At this Grand Duchesss salon Remember the novel An Afternoon In Paris Yes Its undoubtedly the same kind of place Oh see And thats where he met the woman Gives you

Believe me a man shouldnt go out of his way to create handicaps for himself imagine thats what Brutus told Caesar when Caesar said Brutus ve just met a little Egyptian girl by the name of Cleopatra Shes driving me crazy If remember my history correctly Caesar got over it Right But my dear man Cleopatra wasnt Angel If Caesar had ever met Angel it would have changed the history of the Roman Empire It would have collapsed years earlier Well what are years in history pages But one hour with Angel minutes seconds Well give up Its always ridiculous to reason with a man in love And m afraid you are a man in love dont know It may be more than love or less than love Well man make up your mind What is it Its Its a certain feeling Its a secret that belongs to two people and to those two people alone Something you cant Good heavens havent you ever lost your head over a woman Havent you ever felt that at last you can stop searching Youve found it Yes have And youre going to meet her Halton m afraid you and expect different things from love Probably from life dont measure in terms of seconds but of years How about a gin and tonic Not a bad idea Its a charming place you have here Like it say thats

Cigarette Thank you Thank you dear hope didnt come down too soon Of course not Reunion of two old friends Are you sure didnt interrupt Wed just finished a most interesting discussion The newest subject in the world Love Oh Love But we disagreed completely Really Yes we see the same thing but with entirely different eyes Its amazing Its like two men looking at the same lamp One says the shade is blue The other one swears its green You forget Barker Frederick Oh m sorry Frederick We both could be right you know Perhaps the lamp shade is blue But when you light it up it may be the greenest green in the world Dont you think so Lady Barker Gentlemen the sun is shining so brightly Dont you think its rather early in the day to be talking about lamps d rather talk about you Mr Halton You have been in India Yes Are you going to stay in England Hes going back to Paris in a day or so Oh Well may have to change my plans Thats interesting When did this happen Oh as a matter of fact today Yes may have to stay a little longer How fortunate for you to be here at the best part of the year Theres so much going on Theres the ballet and next week therell be the Wimbledon tennis Oh darling am afraid we are going to miss the matches Frederick and are taking a little trip Oh Did you make up your mind dear where you want to go Mmm ve several very interesting ideas m dying to hear them And now shall we have lunch Mr Wilton what do you think of this fellow Halton Oh nice fellow but should say a trifle dull He talks about Paris Paris Paris and again Paris Give me the crumb tray What is it The crumbs at her Ladyships place She seems to be playing with the bread Her Ladyship seems to be a bit nervous No merely bored And how this Halton brags He knows a man who knows every stone in Notre Dame Would you call that an accomplishment And who cares how high the Eiffel Tower is Do you Mr Wilton were used to such brilliant conversation in this house that sometimes wonder if were not a little spoiled Yes quite true Theres always the danger of ones becoming blas Sir Frederick told a delightful joke The Scotchman who wanted to buy a piano And ended up by humming Good He tells it superbly Things seem to be brightening up m glad They must be finished Hello Oh its you Emma Well were at luncheon m pretty busy just now Yes am angry Frankly m furious Unless you can explain where you learned the rumba m through Goodbye Whose plate is this Her Ladyships Hardly touched Can there be anything wrong with the meat hardly think so Mr Wilton Perhaps she just had a late breakfast Whose plate is this Mr Haltons But he hasnt eaten either Its obvious that he tried Maybe there is something wrong Lets see Sir Fredericks plate No its not the meat tell you Mr Halton talked so much Or maybe he doesnt like veal Thats quite possible At any rate make a note If Mr Halton should come again no veal Very well Mr Wilton Splendid Dont you think so darling Yes beautiful Thank you The fact like it doesnt mean anything But Maria shes a composer Frederick She composed the loveliest song Please Play it darling Why dont you Dont make us coax you All right Now let me see how does it go You know think ve forgotten it Oh thats too bad It really was very nice Now how did it go heard a delightful tune in Paris wonder if remember it Gentlemen youre both working too hard insist that you relax please ll play you something even better Oh Frederick went out Its a lovely waltz isnt it First time heard it was dancing with Frederick Takes me right back to Vienna It was our first dance together think it has a beautiful melodic quality dont you Hello Angel beg your pardon Angel What do you mean Mr Halton It seems incredible What seems incredible That should find you here in this house His wife Its like a dream still dont understand you Mr Halton dont understand you Were alone Angel Darling how long are you going to keep this up Mr Halton youre obviously confusing me with another woman Oh no m not There cant possibly be two of you m afraid there must be havent been in Paris for Oh for the last six months You havent been in Paris for six months told you so That should satisfy you It seems to be a terrific coincidence The lady with whom you had your adventure Wasnt it more than that Maybe it was At least thought so Maybe the lady thought so too But its impossible for me to read the mind of a woman never saw nor heard of In other words to you it was Just an adventure Now Mr Halton insist that we settle this once and for all Look at me Look at me carefully And m sure that you will realise as clearly as do that am Lady Barker and nobody else The resemblance is amazing could have sworn it was you You have exactly her hair Her eyes Her skin Her lips But when listen to you begin to see the difference Youre not Angel am greatly relieved Will you forgive me Naturally You know Mr Halton this resemblance will always create embarrassment between us Its unfortunate but for my own comfort and peace and certainly for yours dont you think you might find some excuse not to come here any more You have a lovely home Lady Barker Its in exquisite taste suppose this is the kind of house every woman dreams of having And youre the wife of a charming and famous man You must be very happy Lady Barker am Dont be afraid wont play it shall never play it hope never hear it again Thank you Maria told you in Paris never to look for me never to recognise me wherever you find me The whole thing must be forgotten told you d never keep such a promise All know is that love you and ll never let you out of my life will fight with everything at my command if you should try to destroy my home Why did you ever come to Paris Tell me why Why did you leave me and go back to London It doesnt seem to make sense None whatsoever But its the privilege of a woman not to make sense Men who expect women to be logical are failures in love Have you ever been in love Not with you never told you loved you Never Cant you remember what said Every word Every syllable You said you had grey eyes Brown hair Charming smile Great attraction You still have Thats why want you to go Oh go Please go Every moment you are here my home is in danger Go beg you tell you Maria Angel Come in Wilton will you find Sir Frederick Yes mlady At the present moment am definitely against it Is Hamilton with you Come in Has he sent the papers over Good No m not disturbed but d rather worry now than later Right thank you Goodbye beg pardon sir Just a moment What is it Her Ladyship is asking for you sir Oh all

the telephone Do you really have to go Well dont know How about another drink tried to persuade Mr Halton to stay But m a complete failure Failure Lady Barker really had an engagement but now must stay long enough to turn failure into success Good would like to have a drink too You Whisky darling Just a little Just enough to drink to our friend Mr Halton Thank you dear Heres to you Mr Halton And to Angel Mr Halton told me the most amazing thing that happened to him in Paris Everything told you Do you mind Not at all Always good to get a womans point of view Its a thrilling story and listened to every word with great suspense Mr Halton you described every detail with such love and care Yet you omitted the most important part You failed to describe the woman Yes what does she look like Its difficult to find the exact words to Now think you are being unfair You cant leave us like the daily instalment of a newspaper serial To be continued You have aroused our interest Frederick and are entitled to know a lot more about the lady Now insist Mr Halton What did she look like She was radiant Exciting These are generalities Youre talking like a poet see You want the matteroffact

Barker Thank you Well must be going Thank you for a lovely afternoon Goodbye Lady Barker Mr Halton since ve had the privilege of enjoying your confidence may indulge in a little advice Do Mr Hamilton on the telephone Yes sir Yes Hamilton Yes will you read it to me You wanted to give me some advice Lady Barker m afraid Angel is far from blameless But think you should forget her and perhaps even

refresh your memory Really have an excellent memory but dont seem to remember that name at all Perhaps this might help Your Highness would contribute generously to any charitable institution you might

moment Not at all Hello Frederick Hello Maria Strange place to meet you isnt it Rather strange May ask what you are doing here Curiosity The lady known as Angel caught my imagination You mean you stayed in Paris You actually missed the conference in Geneva Merely to find out if Angel is a brunette Well Frederick thats marvellous can hardly believe it You let all Europe wait just to find out if a woman is a brunette Or a blonde As a matter of fact she is a blonde You remember Mr Halton described the lady Yes he seemed rather uncomfortable Shall tell you why Before you came in he described her differently Would you like to know what he said Very much He said she had blonde hair blue eyes my figure and a slight foreign accent Sounds like a description of you It does doesnt it It annoyed me that there should be another woman who looks exactly like me It disturbed my vanity You know how women are So came here to find out Did you see her Oh yes As a matter of fact shes in the next room
