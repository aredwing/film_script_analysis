Before he died was holding his hand and requested him to come back as a reincarnation GesheLa replied that it all depends on your alls prayers know that GesheLa dont like me to cry but just could not stop And GesheLa said Dont worry dont cry have done everything in my life am totally satisfied with my life Dont cry But still cant stop Look pearl relics Oh here here Tenzin Zopa use both hands Be careful the ashes will fall in Oh look here pattern in the sand Now you can see it clearly What does it look like footprint Here here It points to the east in this direction Dear Tenzin we know you were especially trusted by GesheLa There was an unshakeable bond between you and since you were little he took care of and nurtured you right up until his death We must find his unmistaken reincarnation someone who will continue his kind deeds and help all living beings Right Therefore you should take responsibility for finding his reincarnation As you may know we checked the smoke direction during the cremation and the sand pattern under the cremation pyre We were also told that many pearl relics were found These are significant signs personally informed the Dalai Lama and he said If there are such clear signs we can start looking for the reincarnation was mean totally confused There is joy hearing that GesheLa would definitely return His Holiness already confirmed But when hear that have to be the main person dont want just cannot trust my feelings m not Buddha If something is a visible object of course you can see it but this is something that you need to see its inner quality whether this is the same mind of Lama Konchog or not But to know that only Buddhas know within Buddhas ordinary cannot judge higher than your state Last night had a very interesting dream Its Geshe Lama Konchogs holy body the dead body is lying outside And from Geshe Lama Konchogs dead body one little boy came out And hes like quite fattyfatty and quite small you know So then he called my name Tenzin Zopa Tenzin Zopa give me your hand So then passed my hand You know the feeling in the dream was so joyous and suddenly with that joy was waken up Swambhu Shrine This is east from Kopan Towards India Its here This mountain is the Snow Minister Ganesh Himal Now the astrological check will be done Should send it to Taiwan Yes today For us your disciples born from your holy teachings there is no other refuge than you How could you possibly forsake us Come in your unmistaken reincarnation to guide us In one moment after GesheLa passed away got this very very lost feeling Almost like want to give up many things just dont know what to do and like Because never planned for my life you see Everything was planned by GesheLa You are going to do this youll do that So always say yes just follow and didnt think at all about what is going to happen next Heruka Center Yes in Taiwan Oh Lobsang Jamyang Yes You see What it means My astrology check pointed to three options but one of them is much more significant than the others checked for the reincarnations birthplace and the fathers name What came out with a probability of is that the fathers name begins with the letter You have to search for a father whose name starts with As for the reincarnations birthplace the syllable came out As you know GesheLa meditated for years in Tsum Valley Most probably the child was born in that area Tsum Valley is my birthplace where was born During that time GesheLa already moved to his third cave which is about an hour from my village up in the mountains Always hes always like this you see always Huge and you know long ears laughing Yeah used to be with him like this truly believe that his reincarnation has come However there is a possibility of finding a mistaken one if the disciples lack merits Therefore you should be careful and meticulous You dont have the power to say This is the true reincarnation or not So dont trust everything people say dont take everything as true as people will tell you many unusual stories If someone is labeled as the reincarnation and turns out to be a strange character then all becomes strange and such things have happened Please Tenzin Zopa You dont need to offer me Please accept this No need give to the others Oh thank you Good to see you again How kind of you thank you very much Hello how are you Hello Oh thank you Have

virtues In general liberation including the highest virtue of omniscience is a possibility When you recite In order to benefit sentient beings you are not aspiring to become a Buddha or to have happiness with a selfish motive In fact you are praying to become a source for everyone to have inexhaustible wellbeing and happiness Zopa Rinpoche will go and then we will go together Welcome welcome

Lama Ngodrup Your father is calling you Slowly slowly This is the letter of confirmation from the Dalai Lama recognizing your son Tenzin Ngodrup as the unmistaken reincarnation of Lama Konchog His Holiness not only sent this letter but also did his haircutting ceremony and gave him a new name Tenzin Phuntsok Rinpoche As a Rinpoche he has to go to Kopan or Sera Monastery Right Will get to see him am not sure if will ever get to see him When someone is a Lama he has to be taken away to a monastery He is taken away even though he is a family member We dont know when he will return home think it would be difficult for him to return It would be difficult even to see him So how do you two father and mother feel about your child your child being taken away to the monastery How do you feel about that So what do you feel dont feel You dont If he was an ordinary boy he would marry and work in the fields But he is a reincarnated master who was revered all over the world and had many students Your son Tenzin Ngodrup should assume those responsibilities So do you think you can give the child up Yes can It seems Ahpe is not ready to give If he works for the benefit of sentient beings then can give my child up Otherwise who could give up his child for nothing Thank you Oh my How fortunate we are Where is Mochung Oh my Mochung We had no information We did not know One piece
