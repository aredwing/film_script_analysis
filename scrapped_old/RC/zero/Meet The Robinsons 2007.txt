villainous lair where Doris spun a tale of deception and woe Apparently you invented her to be a Helping Hat a slave to humankind but Doris knew she was capable of so much more However you didnt see her true potential Got it So you shut her down or so you thought We both had a score to settle with you and while my plan for revenge was brilliant Doris was Well we went with Doris but made a very very important contribution Together we made the perfect team Wilbur Make sure you shut that door tight or else the alarm wont engage Yeah Mom went to your house snuck in the garage and stole the time
