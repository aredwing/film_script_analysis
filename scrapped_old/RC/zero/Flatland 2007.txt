line Look closer see like shadings Thats the ether The Fog It dims the light the further away you are Its everywhere so to children and the uneducated its nowhere invisible Thats why they have to feel their way around touching people in order to figure out who or what they are Feelers are sticksville Thats right thats right Now suppose two individuals are approaching triangle and a pentagon Which is which Ah ah ah No touching If that were a real triangle you could hurt yourself on his sharp angles Why cant just walk around it That way could see the shading easier Now thats not done in polite company Sometimes when there are a lot of people you can wiggle back and forth to triangulate but you dont want to go all the way around someone So you figure it out by standing right where you are Urgh But how do do it Infer the shape through the shading See Square How are you Not bad not bad Is my brother in cant do it Am stupid must be a feeler Sight recognition isnt easy know but itll come

the border So did you review my plan Yes sir Problems No sir Good And the speech Brilliant sir Absolutely brilliant Good Whats wrong with Hex He doesnt seem interested in his lessons One of his older brothers told him that he was reconfigured What Hex was making fun of them taunting them Low class Low Sided think Pentagon just wanted to make him shut up Now why did go and do that Hex was being pretty nasty Theres no shame in reconfiguration It was a small genetic defect We should make Hex proud that hes Hexagon The first in the family Some humility would help to temper that pride Go talk to him will Find the physician Yes sir Mister President right away So Square Is everything in place Yes sir No doubt its just year madness Color cant make us all equal Its morally repugnant Mr President

skipped a side when was born Few are as manysided as you son Fewer still are certified Prist Circles And wouldnt be so impressed by them either They arent true circles They arent No of course not Circles simply have lots and lots of sides Some have some have Now those are the ones that are the closest to the divine circularity that we all aspire to but none of us will ever be able to achieve

defense when she she You couldnt stop her What was supposed to do She was a line She couldve killed me There was nothing could do Nothing Nothing All attorneys should be sliced into little pieces and fed to the irregulars Oh ve seen a lot of things ve rounded the cape and watched the burning of Glenhaussen ve seen compatriots split in two by the thousands and ve killed just as many of the enemy in my time But in all my years have never seen such a sniveling coward as you Get out of my sight Come on man ll show you out m going to inform the bar association about this He didnt mean what he said Yes he did And hes right This is a bad time Big things at the Senate today d get home as soon as possible if were you All the units in the city are mobilizing Mobilizing Thats all can say Citizens This is a crucial moment in world history Conflict looms between our Republic and our Northern neighbors Even now the engines of war are building at the border understand the need for reunification For too long families have been torn apart by the political divide For too long weve watched our poor brothers across the border crushed by the tyranny of the Northern Monarch Citizens has it been so long since weve cast away the cruelty of kings that weve forgotten how precious freedom is The Northern Kingdom preaches equality but practices Chromatism They allow Irregular children to avoid reconfiguration Some years ago we followed suit and allowed reconfiguration to become optional And what happened friends We blurred the lines of freedom perhaps forever Ah interesting trinkets arent they cant take my eye off them What are they Uh umm dont really know What is the ah the purpose of the glowing No clue Are they alive Naw Maybe Naw What are they made of Rocks Minerals Crystals or something Dont know really Where are they from distant territory in the Northern Kingdom The North But you cant sell those here can you Thats illegal They change the law every other day cant keep up You wont turn me in will you Well m an attorney That makes me an officer of the court guess that entitles you to a little discount hmm What do you call them Glow Points Do they do anything else except glow like that Well that depends On what On your mood Here hold one Careful theyre delicate And be careful what they touch they can go dead in a heartbeat All right How much Oh they aint cheap Tough to get all the way through the border you know Especially in these times Of course of course Senator Chromatistes does have his points Of course reunification under our own terms is desirable But under Chromatistic terms thief could color himself to resemble a priest rapist could color himself to resemble an attorney Under Chromatism the whole science of Sight Recognition perishes Citizens how are we to protect our daughters and wives under The Senators scheme Oo hoo hoo hoo Let me through let me through Wherever possible our Prist Circles seek equality for everyone Thats why we have the Hospital of Reconfiguration Yes we lose some children but in every case case the parent knows the risk What is civilization based on if not Regularity and Equality of Angles It is nothing Do any of us seriously believe that there is no connection between geometrical and moral Irregularity Citizens There is good and evil Let me through let me through Civilization as we know it would end We would relapse into barbarism Let me through You cant go on repressing the lessersided forever Color is equality We can find a third way Let us consider compromise with the Northern Kingdom Citizens Look what happened when we relaxed our standards and allowed our elected officials to include citizens of any shape We now have an Irregular as a Senator who introduces this Color Bill to our body Bill that if voted into law would allow our citizens to color themselves as they see fit If we adopt the Color Bill our friends to the North could that we mean them no harm They would reduce their arms freely They would make peace with us Appeaser The Northern Kingdom will see this as weakness and enslave us all Lies Lies The Northern Kingdom is not evil They simply feel threatened by us just as we feel threatened by them Senator you dont that You are hoping that am not willing to gamble away our very survival on your Youve already put the future of the Republic at stake At any moment the North might attack and its your fault No no no Stop it Oh stop it Oh that hurts Wait a minute No no no Oh put that down Oh Hey now m warning you m peaceful but oh Oh no no Oh my goodness Oh He interrupted

Argh Two eyes am perfection am Sphere of Messiah Inc what Where did you come from From space where else But arent you already in space What do you know of space Space is length and width No There is a third dimension of length width and height Please your circular Lordship what direction is this third dimension Up Down North and south Nothing of the kind direction in which you cannot look because you have no eye in your side But have an eye Its on my northwest side In order to see in space youd need an eye not on your outside but on your inside looking up or down An eye in my stomach Please sir this is New Years Eve there were horrible riots yesterday my only brother may be dead have family obligations This is no time for jokes didnt come to joke am from the Land of Three Dimensions looked down and saw the plane on which you live can see into your churches your ministries your banks your houses Even your insides and stomachs Everything open and exposed to my view saw your five sons fighting each other with rubber swords And your other son the hexagonal one was sulking off in his room Likes to color himself How do you think knew that We have a name for people like you Yes Perverts There are laws sir There are am what say am You must have drilled through the walls Holes Holes What holes tell you came from three dimensional space You could have filled them back in Difficult little creature Holes m not difficult m a lawyer Lets start over When you see your wife what do you see mean in geometrical terms If you think ll say a onedimensional line youre wrong Every educated person knows that women are very thin rectangles possessing complete twodimensionality length and width just like No no no You also see her height If a line were just width and length it wouldnt occupy space It would be invisible What When we see a line we see length and width and brightness Is brightness a dimension No Height is a dimension like length only in a different direction In your world height is just very very small Point out this direction otherwise leave me alone Listen To you Flatland is your whole world To me its a flat plane on top of which you move around You call me a circle No m an infinite number of circles Sphere a solid When enter your world you see a circle For instance Last night saw your dream about Lineland What As clear as a movie on your brain Movie Nevermind Look The King of Lineland saw you not as a square but a point Its the same for me in Flatland Youre seeing only a slice of me Watch m going to rise up and down in space Watch See Up down Up down And now m going to rise out of your world altogether Where did you go Where are you Here Here Am still dreaming Convinced No its a Chromatist trick Idiot Its no trick thought was dealing with an adult Youre a spy from the Northern Kingdom know it Politics hate politics War is merely an extension of politics my friends just as murder is an extension of business am pleased to announce that our generals have reported back we have successfully crushed the Chromatist rebellion Good job sir Great work At last we have safety Now lets kill the irregulars Ah Square My friends we have Square to thank for orchestrating the maneuver Square you have saved our great Republic Good show old boy what a hero never seen anything like it hes fantastic at logistics But m afraid our job isnt finished my friends There is even now a greater threat that will emerge This very evening Greater threat It will rock the very foundations of our civilization We must be ready Square ll be depending upon you for logistics support Cant you understand anything Look If a point moves north and leaves a luminous wake what name would you give that wake a straight line And how many points would it have Two Now lets move that line parallel to itself distance equal to its length What would you call its wake square And how many sides does a square have How many angles Points Four sides four angles four points Now imagine a square moving parallel to itself Upward What do you mean Northward upward Pass every point in a square so that no point passes through any position previously occupied Each point draws a line on its own You are hurting my brain Look we began with a single point One point produces a line with two points One line produces a square with four points One two four Whats next Eight Yes It produces a Something which you do not know the name for but which we call acube With eight points This cube has sides Yes but what you call sides we call faces of a solid in the world How many sides point has zero sides line has two sides square has four sides Zero two four Get it And now the next number would be Six Yes You see it now dont you Youre a monster You Devil You Die You Die What is wrong with your species see a brain but when it comes to imagination all you try and do is kill something come for an apostle of the Three Dimensions and find a fool instead m no fool Were only allowed to appear in your world every thousand years Youve been chosen cant go change directions and find someone else now There isnt any time m just an attorney Not an apostle Okay then how would you convince me if our roles were reversed How would you convince a jury would have to show them Directly show them Of course Action not words Listen can see from here your study On the wall is a hidden safe inside of which is hidden a little glowing thing Its called a Glow Point No Wait Leave that alone m entering the safe now Grabbing the glowing thingie Notice that the door does not move Now am in the safe and m taking the glowing thingie uh whups What What It stopped glowing Well never mind Ah Heres your thingie The door to the safe is closed Tadah Get it Spaceland Flatland look down upon you all youve proven is that you are a a skillful thief And a vandal You fix my Glow Point You people certainly like your shiny things dont you Ok listen The higher go the further away from Flatland go the more can see though of course see it on a smaller scale For example now can see your neighbors house and your five Pentagonal Sons banging against its sides told them to stay inside Now m going far far up Buildings buildings buildings now see the border between your country and the Northern Kingdom Uh oh Looks busy Mostly Soldier Triangles Looks like theyre getting ready for something Oh anyone can listen to the radio Fine fine fine How about if touch you Touch me Sure Just a little touch gently here In your stomach Ow Stop Ow Stop Help Help Ow Dad Whats happening dad Why are you stuck in the corner Wheres the priest Go back to your rooms both of you Should use my peace cry Just go Go Theres only one other thing to do Its never been done before but suppose ll have to do it Do what Murder me Youve done everything else Nothing of the sort It will be painful and could get in trouble But ve got no choice if the Gospel of Three Dimensions is to be revealed Hang on apostle One two three out of Flatland we go m mad m insane What have you done to me Lifted you out of Flatland into reality Steady There can you stand Rest on your bottom hairs for a moment What is this pressure Its pushing me southward My south hairs hurt Oh that Youll get used to that Thats just gravity something we all have to contend with in Spaceland Nothing to worry about Now that see you all of you youre youre so so perfect Your circularity is beyond circularity Everywhere youre circular divine Perfect divine ideal of loveliness and wisdom Feel free to worship me at any time But first lets take a look at where youve been Look Look a Flatlander You can see their insides see see take it that my experiment worked hope my ends will justify my means Care to see yourself Myself How can see myself am inside of myself In you can have reflections Light can bounce off an object which you can use to see yourself Here Thats me No its your reflection Thank you Thank you for showing me this see now see everything Everything understand it all can see Whats that glowing sphere in the sky The sun Best not to look at it for too long it could blind you How does it stay up there in the sky Just does Our scientists say it is immeasurably huge Larger than anything else in the entire world But its smaller than you No thats just perspective The further away something is the smaller it looks But no its very very large Makes me puny by comparison That cant be Youre a perfect circle divine in all respects Yes yes cant argue with you there But still some of us even worship it ow wondrous a world that gods would have even greater gods to worship guess theres always something smaller and always something larger than you wonder what does this sun worship Are there beings even greater than this glorious sun Alright thats enough Lets not get silly now What is that Oh And look at those Glow Points That is the moon Another Sphere of great proportions And those arent Glow Points Those are stars If only could show this to my wife And my son Hex Its rather expensive to pull someone out of Flatland m afraid this production really cant really afford anyone but you Sorry There is so much to understand For instance am in Spaceland and can see the insides of myself and can see the insides of all my fellow Flatlanders yet see no brain lungs or heart inside of you Of course you cant see in my insides Spacelanders are of a greater order than Flatlanders am a being of many circles the Many in the One What we in Spaceland call Sphere Dont worry The mysteries of the world of Spaceland will become plain to you after a while We can fly anywhere you like and view your world in detail Lets start with your house and work our way out Eeee eeee eeee Is someone there Its me m here outside the world Cant see you cant hear you Eeeee eeee eeee can see everything Youve given me the eyes the eyes of God You can see what any fool in the world of can see The Great Hall Now that m in Spaceland can get past the soldiers to see if my brother is inside Now youre thinking in ve got business there too Lets go Oh There he is Hey Shh Looks like your elite priests are gathering for their millennial

could expect this You people cant write Write Writing Recording words visually Its what we do to pass information down through the generations dont understand Your people worked around it You memorize

Chromatic insurrection assure you this one will be even simpler The secret memories have predicted everything we have seen The circle who claims hes from another world all this was as our forefathers foresaw The priestly circles alone remember how the same occurrence happened on the last two millennial commencements How can you people be so smart and yet so stupid Just look at this You are all required to say nothing of these trifles outside this Cabinet Call for the Praetorian Guards These Soldier Triangles must be put to death right away All of them There thats done No trace no harm These

Gravitational forces will kill it if it stays too long What If you ladies will see that m not disturbed for the next hour After that want to meet with Marketing Yes sir Solids Thats the first lesson and the last Solids Thats what we are and youre not Youre not solid not really because solid implies thickness Your thickness is microscopic Lets begin First a cube is made up of a number of square planes like yourself Now heres a pack of cards put one down Now a second now a third See m building a solid by a multitude of squares parallel to one another And now the solid is complete being as high as it is long and broad We call this solid a cube It hurts my brain m sure it does Light shadow perspective youre not used to it Yes sir Send in a cube Which one Anyone Yes sir m going to let you feel a cube Thatll help you understand solids Let this Flatlander touch you Dont worry it wont hurt And there wont be any side effects that we know of Dean in Sending isnt it Carlton in Receiving Of

forever you know Thank you Carlson Carlton Now lesson two Your pardon Great Sphere of but might be granted a look at your insides My what Your stomach brain heart What the devil are you talking about When was feeling the cube a light overwhelmed me and saw more and farther than ve ever seen before Uh huh What saw or sensed or felt Was that a dimension greater than yours existed Just as am to you so you must be to someone else If your dimension is greater and purer than mine then there must be a fourth dimension even greater and purer than yours Good friend philosopher priest dont you see what youve taught me Some more spacious space some more dimensionable dimension lies beyond this one Times short Weve got a lot to do before youre fit to proclaim the Three Dimensions Please sir let me see your insides In the first place your request makes no sense In the second place cant turn myself inside out But you showed me the insides of Flatland by taking me from the land of two dimensions into the land of three Please take me into a fourth dimension so that we can look onto the land of and see the secrets of solids And where is this land of four dimensions supposed to be Doubtless you great Teacher of dimensionality greater than mine surely you know where it is Damned if do There is no such place The very idea Inconceivable Well you taught me that when see a line in Flatland and infer a plane in reality see a third dimension Not the same as brightness but one called height So it follows that in Spaceland when see a plane and infer a solid really see a fourth unrecognized dimension Just as the monarch of Lineland couldnt turn right or left or see Flatland so couldnt see Spaceland even though it was all around me So there must be a fourth dimension outside Spaceland Tell me has anyone seen any you know visitors here in Spaceland few madmen The usual visions delusions brainstorms Nothing worth writing about Tell me did any of these delusions appear and vanish suddenly Well thats how the story sometimes goes a story written by deluded mentally sick brains Maybe they come from thought told you not to disturb me m sorry sir The Board of Directors are here Weve got a problem What Your ecomm was leaked to the public What When just submitted it Public opinion is against us They think youve made a terrible mistake Theres a hearing in the Senate Chambers going on

much yes and no answers Be as boolean and binary as you can be No pressure but the Zeroes in the Senate may have enough votes to win The Zeroes Political faction Theyve gotten momentum because brought you out of Flatland They think Flatland is an abomination that should be wiped out What It disturbs them that there are creatures such as yourselves They think we shouldnt be trying to teach you the Gospel of They think we should be putting you out of your misery Misery Just dont say anything stupid Do you mean to tell me Mister Sphere Just call me Sphere Senator ll call you what like boy Do you mean to tell me that you took it upon yourself to bring this disgusting creature into our world without any oversight Hmm It was a splitsecond decision Senator Our company had done research on what such an action would mean of course Wed run computer simulations and Computer simulations And these simulations made you certain that there would be no unintended consequences That there would be no danger to Spaceland Of course Senator But you werent percent certain were you Were still here Senator Is a computer simulation of no danger No Senator of course not computer simulation is only a simulation It isnt real We simply had a good idea of what You scientists never consider the possibility that you could be wrong that your science could one day be the end of the entire world you look at your computer simulations and take great risks with the public good without oversight without any If youd relinquish the floor d like to interview the Flatlander Senator Were here to decide if we should perform euthanasia on Flatland or not After all the scientists are not the ones on trial here Not yet Of course of course yield the floor to my distinguished Cubic Colleague Now Mr Square Youve

him up please Answer the question Flatlander Why should Flatland have a continued existence Because In order to turn a circle into Sphere we rotate ninety degrees the circle along its vertical axis
