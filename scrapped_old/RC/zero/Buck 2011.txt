Wind howling Rustic acoustic guitar music How you doing there buddy See that feels good doesnt it huh All right well m off to the office To start off are there any of you that have any particular problems youd like to tell me about Dont be bashful Youre among friends Whoa whoa whoa Let him be cause hes learning how to kind of settle in with you lot of times rather than helping people with horse problems m helping horses with people problems And for a lot of people they want it all to be fuzzy and warm and cosmic but it is no different with a horse than with a kid You cant always be the kids best friend First you have to be the parent horse like this isnt any different than a kid that takes everybodys milk money on the way to school beats up old people Maybe it isnt the kids fault Maybe the parent ought to be in jail Boy do you feel like a fool and kind of like a failure You know Aw its all right People bring a lot of baggage to the table when they come to these Sometimes theyre here for a different reason other than just getting to where they can ride their horse a little bit better If you find a way to fit this thing right here itll make you better Itll make you better in areas that you didnt think related to horses Good job buddy Horses are my life and because of some of the things ve been through as a kid found some safety and some companionship in the horses was just looking for kind of a peaceful place to be where wasnt threatened where my life wasnt threatened So have an empathy for horses that when something is scared for their life understand that Hes a pretty nice horse six years old Making some good progress anyway Just a youngster just telling him want him to be aware of me If slow down want him to slow down See if go like this have to practice my old man walk So when m really old it might take me an hour to get over there He ought to be able to just go with me as slow as want to go and not crowd me Might be a little slower than what hed like to go If stop he ought to stop If go back he ought to go back and ought not to have to beg him Right now walk at a little faster pace but m always testing him to see if hes with me When first seen him thought What kind of voodoo stuff is this you know How are you getting this done you know He walks into a round pen In five minutes hes got a horse following him around like a dog He and go together Most of us have a bag of tricks and Buck has an arsenal Hey boys Morning Hello how you doing Good Good Colt starting is always interesting because most of the youngsters have never been saddled never had anyone on their back or a bit in their mouth So there is a lot of fear in both the horse and the human The way do these colt classes you guys youll have to get them exposed to a lot of things that seem perfectly normal to you but it doesnt seem normal to the horse You walk up to them smelling like a Big Mac you know or something horse neighing Your diet is gonna make you smell different to the horse and then youre gonna tell the horse Dont worry want to crawl on you laughter In a similar posture to how a lion would attack and kill a horse They jump right up in the middle of them and they reach their front claws around and as theyre biting down on their spine theyre cutting their throat with their claws Youre asking the horse to let you be in that posture and crawl on him And then about the time he says All right maybe and then you say Oh oh one more thing want to strap some hides of other dead animals around you before crawl on you You damn sure have to have some trust Hes got to believe in you to let you do that and amazingly enough theyll let you do it Now the first thing that m gonna show you is leading the horse by Step in here Extend the front over like that Then hell go on forward around me This takes some practice to get good at Your horse might be afraid to move Its a real trust thing between the two of you Whats your name dear Martha Okay Martha you want to go the other way You got your horse leading by good just the wrong direction Thats all right Tap her Dont be afraid of tapping her with that flag You arent gonna hurt her It would be like you getting spanked with a sock There yeah Dave lead with the right hand Yeah its in your left hand The other left Walk to the hip No walk to the hip Youre at the head Thats the eating end This is always a hard one for folks Horse neighs Pam that walking on you Now your horse is kind of naughty You guys make a big old circle around me This horse it knows to get away cause shes pretty fearful No you wont get away She said thought had the angle on you there See that head slinging to the outside Thats unacceptable But she doesnt know the difference She said Well up to this point ve had some pretty damn good luck with that technique See there where she went to run me over That means shes trying to protect herself But when get done will not have to close my hand on the end of this rope Now d touch her here on the neck d say You find out this flag wont hurt you Nobodys here to hurt you One of the things that really struck me was that you always grow up hearing about breaking horses or breaking broncos or something Theres a whole element of abuse really of its man is stronger than this big animal We can break them down almost like Parris Island and a drill instructor and think it first clicked for me with Buck at the whole concept of starting My early exposure to horses was severe Tying horses to posts with an inner tube tire so that when the horse pulled back they would slam back into the post It was really brutal really truly brutal It was heartbreaking didnt know any different was a child But remember crying a lot felt very very bad for the animals So when met Buck was the instant convert You cant be a good guy when you leave the barn and a bad guy when you get to the barn And if treat animals this way do treat people that way too We all know the answer to that met Buck probably at his first clinic that he gave If wasnt at his first clinic was probably at his second There was a nice change And the first time saw was amazing to me l it just blew my mind It just blew my mind that it could be done in a way that the horse would cooperate like the people and not be scarred up and afraid for life couldnt believe what that man could do with a horse without anything on it mean he could load horses in a horse trailer without touching them mean it the horse has never been in a trailer Thats phenomenal Why let an animal live in fear Why not fix it Thats pretty good You notice how dont have to have a death grip on the doggone lead rope now In this particular discipline if you want to be great you have to be a sensitive person That vulnerability that sensitivity to feel the subtle change is what makes you great Thats why so many of the folks that are really good at this are you know sometimes theyre tortured souls you know Horse neighs ve seen some kind of dark things in my life but everybody has a bit of a burden to bear of some sort so its all relative Its all ever wanted to be was a cowboy grew up as a trick roper That wasnt necessarily by choice but the first thing is we were entertainers my brother and started doing rope tricks when was three years old You wouldnt think that a threeyearold could be doing rope tricks but was doing rope tricks turned professional when was six And as far as know we are still the youngest kids to ever get a card which it was the in those days Rodeo Cowboy Association And we went to fairs and rodeos and performed all over But we really enjoyed the attention of the crowds We were kind of childhood celebrities you know We were the Kelloggs Sugar Pops kids You know fancy roping takes hard work plenty of sleep and good nutrition every day Heres a good hardworking breakfast Oh it must have been right around in there It was just before my mom passed away That was quite a thing And all remember about that commercial it should have been real fun cause it was a big thrill to all the kids in school that we were on national television doing these commercials All really remember about that is that my dad beat us unmercifully for not putting on a perfect performance and then he drove us home and heck he couldnt even wait till we got home He stopped and knocked on us a little bit more remember my mom would drop us off at school The last couple of years she was alive she was working as a waitress in Ennis Montana and would beg her not to leave and every day would cry Every day she would cry because was just terrified of the fact that was gonna be five or six hours alone with our dad when we got home from school before my mom would get home cause things always went better when she was around But then when my mom died knew my life was over as knew it and no longer had my protector Well after my mom passed away my dad really fell apart and night after night after night he would come yank us out of the bed in the middle of the night and make us sit at this kitchen table this oak table could draw the grain in that table for you to this day cause youd just stare down at the table because even to just look at my dad when he was ranting and raving in a drunken stupor he would take that as an aggressive expression And one night just said m not gonna get beat up again tonight m just cant do it And made a mad dash outside and not thinking about the fact that wasnt very welldressed for being outside in the middle of the winter cause it was cold It was somewhere between below zero Well damn then was really stuck because knew if went back inside he was gonna beat me half to death and just couldnt go back in just couldnt We had a dog and his name was Duke and loved that dog It sounds real trailer park know but he lived in a gallon barrel with straw in it for his bed and crawled in that gallon barrel with that bloodhound It wasnt warm but it kept me from freezing and finally after two or three hours went back in the house and he just looked at me like Where you been Reata cant believe you answered your phone Where are you speaking indistinctly Oh cool What are you doing speaking indistinctly For your mom or for school For school All right well ll call her back and then ll talk to you tomorrow huh Okay sounds good Okay love you buddy Bye was watching Oprah dont know if should admit to that But was watching Oprah and she said that the greatest aphrodisiac there was for a man was to have a vacuum and to actually run it in the presence of his wife So she knows quite a bit so thought Well ll it cant hurt You know you never know where youre gonna get some information Hey you Gonna put the smaller one in the back Theres not quite as much room We got years in now Yeah years get to where dont even worry about what day it is All know is its just all in fourday intervals for me dont know you get in a rhythm by doing this and you oh after just a few days of being somewhere youre kind of ready to go to the next one Hey Mary its just me Good What are you doing Got the clinic done here Didnt make anybody cry Chuckles Talk to you later on All right Mary miss you do this weeks out of the year For the rest of the year you could say Where are you gonna be on such and such a day And could tell you exactly where m gonna be till about Thanksgiving Walkertown North Carolina Huntsville Alabama Limerick Maine Bay Harbor Michigan Cedar Rapids Iowa Longmont Colorado Thermopolis Wyoming Bend Oregon Bozeman Montana Libby Montana Yeah theres some loneliness You know its truck stops and driving late at night and just trying to get to your next spot and youre alone you know Thats when you really miss your family and you want to be home and you think of what it would be like just walking barefoot across the living room and going to bed But there is no way thats ever gonna be anything other than what it is How are you Hey how are you Indistinct chatter Shes gonna make me a Manhattan And can make more than one if somebody wants one Theyre in the back Were you at that clinic in Ellensburg when it was so cold when Bob Blackwell Yeah that was years ago That was my first clinic with you And they brought them in these horses in in stock trailers literally They opened up the door and they went into the round pen and there was and he roped every one of them mutual friend invited me and was pretty skeptical about the clinic and the approach And went pretty convinced that wasnt gonna appreciate anything that saw And then he started working with all these babies And was blown away mean couldnt believe what saw and the rapport that he had with them You know it just kind of stopped me in my tracks My whole life has been encompassed around Arabian and halfArabian show horses from the time was a little girl was showing horses and thinking that everything was cool the way was doing things and the way saw things being done and m proud of a lot of those prizes that won but m equally ashamed of a lot of them too Horses are put into forced positions that theyre neither mentally or physically prepared to handle and these practices arent used nearly as much now as they were years ago but the horses would be put into hock hobbles that would go from the hocks up through the snaffle and back down so that every time he took a step with his hocks you know itd take ahold of his face to teach him to stay into that real infixed position But theres no connection for the horse Theres no understanding of that except for it hurts So theyre gonna stay away from those pressures and learn to infix themselves into those positions because through intimidation And just thought that thats the way you did it And thats what the horses had to do to be show horses and you dont realize how unjust it is until you until someone shows you a different path Come on Lets say the horse needed you to be firm Theres a difference between firm and hard Lets say needed to take ahold of the horse with pounds The way go about getting to pounds is gonna have a lot to do with whether youre successful or not Hold on to that m gonna pull on you some so dont let me get it away from you Okay so close your hand on that or its gonna come away from you and dont give to me Lets say needed to pull on this horse about that hard The way took ahold of you wasnt really offensive wouldnt make you afraid But lets say was abrupt and had hands like a butcher and took ahold of the horse like that Now m pulling about like what said but its how got there Be ready Its how got there that could be rude to the horse Now watch Robert closely m just riding with bad hands Oh you braced didnt hit you Whyd you do that Hes protecting himself Once ve done this a few times with him hell brace all the time like that See him brace You cant help yourself And m even telling you youre gonna do it and you still cant help it But if took ahold like this you might give to me and then d give to you But its the way go about it and whenever youre ready maybe youd give to me see Otherwise ll just wait here Nobodys gonna get any lunch today When you started to soften so did and you both feel together If you were real sensitive to me when feel of you here youd already be giving see That means something to my horse Thats what a soft feel thats what do to get a soft feel right there And want you to get at least a mental picture of what a horse operating on a feel is to where hopefully it looks good to you that youll want that that youll strive for that So this is one example of a feel see could even take on this rope right here like this see Thats operating on a feel see could do this and say Get back And could do this and say Get over Without touching him your energy moves the horse Most people think of a feel as when you touch something or someone and what it feels like to your fingers but a feel can have a thousand different definitions Sometimes feel is a mental thing Sometimes feel can happen clear across the arena Thats what m looking for there Sort of an invitation from the horse to come to you Its not always physical Sometimes its mental When you have the physical working for you when youre younger you ride with physical and mental But if you could learn how to use mental and physical youd be better off m looking for the horse to learn how to follow a feel Its supposed to take that much Little bit more There Left right left right left right Everything is a dance Everything you do with a horse is a dance Now ll open him up a little bit here Problem is when a lot of folks cant get a horse to operate on a feel theyll get a little more bridle get a little more shank on it drive a spur through the horses shoulder then tie his head down then get a bicycle chain over his nose mean it doesnt stop It becomes medieval Now m gonna tip the life up in him here Were moving on a feel You know a horse is pretty sensitive horse can feel a mosquito land on their butt in a windstorm Every movement you make on a horse there is a perfect position of balance that takes no energy from the horse He doesnt feel like he is pushing you along with him or dragging you along with him Hes built to fit a horse you know God had him in mind when he made a cowboy you know ve never actually seen him whisper a horse but guess if theres a horse whisperer out there its Buck Brannaman dont know you know Originally got connected to The Horse Whisperer through Nick Evans and he said m researching some characters for my book and m trying to find a way to bring this character to life And was doing a clinic in California and kind of a hippielooking guy came up and he said m a movie producer He said was wondering if you could meet with me and Bob said Bob In my business artificiality is part of the business You look for authentic people And so when met Buck my first thought was Well what the hell is this Guy walks into an office in Santa Monica Hes got a big hat on Hes got his vest and so forth He looks like hes got a costume on and thought Oh my God you know whats And his compatriot who was with him the same outfit and thought Oh jeez what have gotten into here And then the etiquette the politeness the humanity that kind of came off real quick kind of erased that and then we sat in the office for about an hour and a half and talked about things that were authentic and so realized that was really dealing with what would call the real deal Nononsense guy nononsense you know whether with the animal or people He was an advisor that brought on that slowly worked his way into the core of the filmmaking because he just knew more So Buck contributed everything as a model and also as a player used him as a double So he was a huge part of the fabric of the film and he was able to do things that the hired trainer could not do There was a scene that Scarlett was supposed to go into the stall with the horse and it was her first time being near the horse since the accident and the action for the horse was he was supposed to sort of paw the ground and show a little aggression and then come to her and respond to her and more or less put his head in her arms and it was an Aw gee a real touching scene and they couldnt get the shot because the horse was a trick horse and they are trained to not take their eyes off the trainer The horse nuzzled the wood The horse nuzzled the frame The horse nuzzled the boots of the trainer but wouldnt nuzzle Scarlett The meter was ticking and you know time is money and all that stuff So was going into a panic They said What are we gonna do said What do you mean what are you gonna do He said Well we never got that shot said Yeah we sure spent a long time at it too He said Yeah eight hours You got any ideas said Yeah why dont we use my horse Pet And at first everybody said Well you know you dont understand Buck You know we use Hollywood trick horses for this because theyre performers and they can do things on the mark so we can pull a focus on a certain place and you just dont understand that We dont not downplaying your thing Buck but its like but Pet he doesnt know how to work on a mark Hes not an actor said No hes a horse said What do you have to lose So dinked around with my horse and got him where could lead him by front foot with a rope on him and got him where could jiggle that rope and hed paw the ground on the mark So he came up and he just put his head right in her chest and she wrapped her arms around that horse laid her head on his forehead and everybody was crying God within So Buck played a greater role than a lot of people realize He contributed everything There was a humanity and a kind of gentleness of spirit that adopted for that character because of Buck When saw the finished product he looked good told him There is some potential there Bob if this movie thing doesnt work out for you think could probably get you to where you could make a living doing this Laughs This one you want me to take right here Yeah Okay Reata might have you check on Charro and see if hes eaten Okay ve been traveling with Dad during the summers usually from end of June till end of August Its been two months since ve seen my dad My dads on the road nine months out of the year and its tough but m kind of used to it now mean ve been doing it since was well forever so Heads up Weve got a few sacks of feed to schlep across here Reata you and Nevada need to go wrap up all the sound Yeah Nevadas going with me My partner in crime just started traveling with them last year spent a month with them think were helpful to a point Sometimes maybe were in the way cause he has like a way of doing things you know What are you doing Bringing you breakfast What is it Sticky buns might just have one dont want the Thatll do me Thanks mate So guess you got a lot of songs transferred for me on my iPod Traveling with Dad it can get pretty stressful sometimes just because he is like a travel Nazi Make sure you plug that little deal give me that Cause he has his own way of how he does everything and we kind of mess up the process sometimes Aw Reata Aw you put the top on backwards But then when it comes to like cleaning pens and saddling his horses and stuff like that think he kind of appreciates us Howd you do Nasty Hey Reata Yeah Bring me back a sack for trash when you after you feed Sure ride every summer usually take one of my horses Step up in here and get a dally on and stop my horse get a lot learn a lot on it Every clinic that we go to during the summer is different The horses are different different people There you followed by feel The horse world can be pretty cliquey Well we dont go for cliques around here There are probably some people here that its just pittance pocket change for them to come and some of them save all year long just to be able to go to this clinic Put on my Madonna microphone How we fixed here Maggie You getting his chin down a little bit You want to release as quick as you can Hes gonna give in a second There there Pet him Thats the way My daughter she had a hard time releasing d say Reata your arms and shed go like that Spread your hands a little more Get them a little lower There you go Nice You want that horse to be an extension of you but then you dont control your legs You think youre just gonna control this part of the body This is a body The whole thing is a body If all of you didnt have a horse here and was trying to talk to you wouldnt that be weird if you said Hey dont have control of my legs All of a sudden they just tear off and youre like Oh jeez sorry Waiting on the coffee Hes got to have his coffee Black m sure that comes as a big surprise He has the coffee and then he lets down and it kind of smooths out Going to Sheridan Montana Sheridan Montana is there and were up here probably seven hours Not too long Yeah its a great bunch of folks at this clinic Good to see you Good to see you Welcome to Montana lot of them ve known since was a kid Some of them went to school with Some of them went to school with their parents Its like its coming home for me here Its gonna be a busy week cause Moms gonna be in Sheridan Hi How are you m good How are you havent seen Mary for a couple of months Hi Dally Hi buddy So its been an awful long run Mary she doesnt like to travel as much but d sure like her to go with me a little bit more and she may go with me a little bit more once Reata goes off to college So this is Twyla Rudy This is Dally Oh Dally Hey Rudy Rudys grown a little bit since left dont know how many dogs you need before you have enough dogs They worked their way up the food chain past me but my wife loves them and love my wife so if it makes her happy makes me happy actually do like traveling on the road Its fun Its really fun mean you get to meet a lot of different people and see a lot of different beautiful places Like this place is amazing But like staying home too though Okay are there any of you that have any real problems with them that youd like to kind of mention He runs me over He runs you over Okay lovely Well a baby like that theyre not trying to be pushy They might be sort of crowding you just a little bit because they still might be scared They kind of think that maybe if they get real close to you theyll get some comfort And the big thing you guys is dont be overly critical of them cause theyre just babies If he feels like youre angry at him at all he will shut down dont know where Buck draws his real personal strength from because hes lived through a lot mean it He came out of such dire straits and you know was virtually think plucked from his home in the middle of the night sort of a thing Its a real hard story to tell cause you know you see him now and you know dont even think about that Ace was real hard on those boys You knew there was something wrong there maybe but you werent for sure what You know he kept it hid pretty well guess until the point when Coach Cleverly You know seen his back Ah thats a hard story to think about Bob Cleverly was a typical football coach that you loved but feared too you know and hed actually made Buck shower in and when he didnt want to shower you know and he told him to you know get undressed and get in the shower you know as soon as Buck started taking his shirt off he seen the whip marks and the thing of it is is you know he just basically told him he said Your dad will never beat you again ll make sure of that you know And then thats when Johnny France kind of started the ball rolling to get Buck and Smokie to a safe place was present when the boys were forced to disrobe and on their legs and their little buttocks were these big whip marks where their dad had beat them When looked at these little boys said No well have none of that took them to the Shirleys They were two frightened little boys but it wasnt too long before the two boys were just they just turned into Shirleys My mom had had just died And she was very loving wasnt she Yeah She was a very loving lady So she became my new mom and boy that was something really needed Sleep good did They have a wonderful relationship and shes a guiding force May God bless you and watch over you Theres no sense that Okay youre raised Youre gone mean shes their mother Shes truly their mother and think Betsy raised something like foster sons mean all boys all boys When our kids were little it was like a zoo and it was every man for himself and survival of the fittest My motto thats stood me in good stead is Blessed are the flexible for they shall not get bent out of shape Laughs My foster dad taught me how to shoe horses was years old When first went to live with them he told me Kid you might not ever amount to much but you better learn how to ride a colt and shoe a horse And then youll always be able to eat Even if you cant get much of a job youll always be able to eat So he taught me how to shoe a horse over a period of time There were so many things that learned while was with my foster parents When first got dropped off at the Shirley ranch was so terrified of men and my fosterdadtobe he pulled in in the truck and gee he was tall just looked like he was made out of rawhide and barbwire But he walked right up to me and he said You must be Buck and shook his hand but couldnt even speak Its real you can be so scared that you cant say anything No words come out just sat there and my little knees were just about knocking together was a little guy And then he spun around walked back to the truck and opened the door and my heart just stopped Because its almost like a colt thats had some trouble You dont have to do too much to make them suspicious just even move in a little bit of a way that they dont understand or cant comprehend and that quick they they think they need to save themselves So when he went back to that truck and opened the door didnt know what to do Scared me to death He came back and he threw me a pair of buckskin gloves He said Here He said Youre gonna need them and gee they were just beautiful and they fit me perfect was so proud of them And he looked over at the ranch truck and he said Get in So we got in and he always had fencing tools in the truck So we took off and we built fence all afternoon pounding steel posts into rocks and pulling wire but wouldnt wear those gloves There was just that that token act of kindness just giving me something like that Oh gee it meant so much didnt want to get them all tore up so kept them in my pocket and just worked with the barbwire with my bare hands And he realized that didnt need someone to just pity me for what d been through He knew just needed something to do needed a job to do And thats when things started to head in the right direction for me So learned that about the horses years later thought Oh yeah Thats kind of what Forrest did with me come to think of it Horse neighs You see the expression on that horse It moves but hes crabby Flagging the tail its annoyed Its like asking your kid to go take the garbage out They take the garbage out but they flip you the bird on the way out of the room Its without respect and respect isnt fear Its acceptance He bucks whenever saddle him not when saddle him but when get him to go through transitions ve never started a colt ever in my life ve always been around really wellbroke ones So this is my first shot at it And hes got a little bit of Buck in him So you must be Bill am Bill Thats why asked Bill Seaton to ride him cause Chief needs a confident rider for that first ride bought Chief about a year and a half ago He was one He had never had any human contact Born out in the field wasnt touched handled nothing Its just a rodeo and disaster waiting to happen Its not his fault Hes like a kid that just didnt have any good parenting He just doesnt know whats to be expected of him want to check your horse out If youre gonna do anything shocking d rather you did the shocking stuff right here than when youre on their back Right here Step over He says Well prefer you beg me Not a chance Theres the good deal offered Theres not so good a deal Thats the thing with a horse You cant just love on them and buy lots of carrots Bribery doesnt work with horses No different than trying to bribe a kid All it does is make a contemptuous spoiled horse But you dont want them afraid of you You can be strict but you dont need to be unfair and like say its not personal dont feel any different about him than do my own horse just stepped off Were not mad at you One of the biggest challenges of a horseman is is to be able to control your emotions because a person might be quick to get all mad There you go Thats better Lets go this way said that way You allow a horse to make mistakes The horse will learn from mistakes no different than the human But you cant get him to where he dreads making mistakes for fear of whats gonna happen after he does Sometimes ll just move this flag around and dont want him to be afraid of it m saying just live with that Now well start again Theres a change Attaboy Buck says when you start handling horses your own personal issues start coming out And was so anxious to see the saddle on Chief rushed him to it and now ve built feel like ve built this fear and this insecurity in him But see m an insecure person so they horses they mirror you They cant lie There Good boy Horsemanship fine horsemanship becomes a way of life Its not about controlling the horses It becomes how you treat your spouse how you treat strangers Will you give people a chance just like you give the horses a chance It becomes how you discipline your children You know you can discipline and discourage or you can discipline and encourage You can say see you tried that What do you think you should try instead Tentative but he tried and d pet him with this You can just leave him be for a little while Just kind of hang with him and let that soak in Thats a more building sort of approach than Thats wrong Thats wrong Thats wrong All right its time Go on out that end Go into the round corral Were gonna go for a little ride here How you getting along Bill Great Looks pretty good Sure does doesnt it See if you can get on a lope Good Well done Coming through There you go Way to go That should have felt pretty good to you Bill It did Kind of where you end up your ride on a horse is so important you guys Its a little bit like when you guys were younger and you were dating That last two minutes of the date can be a real deal breaker With these horses its the same thing you know You got to quit on a good note That was a good day All right ll see you guys tomorrow Raspberry and peach cobbler which would you like Going for raspberry Oh that one Hey Buck why dont you do some rope tricks This is kind of a tricky one here This is the move used to always do for Mary when was trying to trap her Laughter Dog barking People cheering He was just a very ordinary boy didnt show signs of early genius Laughs Thanks Mom There was one point he thought maybe his trick roping would be his avenue to success but when he first saw Ray Hunt doing his thing he was so fascinated he focused on that Cheers and applause Pretty much anybody thats been involved in the horse world knows Ray Hunt and Ray brought this style of horsemanship to the world Tom Dorrance was sort of the godfather of all of this Tom Dorrance taught Ray Hunt Ray Hunt taught Buck Brannaman Thats kind of the lineage as it were met Ray right after got out of high school One of my teachers told me about this guy that could start a horse and get on him in just a few minutes and ride him around with no bridle on and thought Right d grown up on a ranch was pretty punchy Rode a lot of colts and a pretty fair bronc rider for a kid thought Yeah another songanddance man some horse show dude had an opportunity to go get this cowboying job at a place called Madison River Cattle Company They said Well in order for you to get hired youre gonna have to go talk to the manager and hes at a Ray Hunt clinic And thought Aw great Heres this Ray Hunt guy again So go into the fairgrounds Sat about as far away as could so that could show that was not interested in this And then in come Ray Hunt saw him do more things with a horse in a couple of minutes than d ever figured anybody could do with a horse He worked with a colt that was pretty touchy and had been around enough to know what a touchy horse looked like You could tell the horse truly understood what he was expecting of her He could take those feet anywhere he wanted They were his feet It was just an extension of him It was like a beautiful dance took right to it as soon as saw it thought dont even know what it is but whatever it is need this So that was the beginning for me went to Rays clinics if not every week every other week for the next four or five years was right down in the arena hanging over the round corral watching this guy lift a rein or move a foot might not have known all what he was doing but was seeing it We got to be very close and even though he said it wasnt that important that pleased him or that people pleased him looked for his approval you know the same way you would a father figure And later on when Ray passed away shed way more tears for him than ever did my dad Now you guys dont have to ride like Ray Hunt or Tom Dorrance but thats the choice made First clinic ever did probably wasnt you know a real effective teacher was a pretty decent hand by then could get a little bit of stuff done with a horse But m sure just sounded like was parodying Ray Hunt didnt have anything original of my own to really talk about and was so introverted at the time and felt so uncomfortable committed right then that was gonna do enough little local clinics to conquer that Buck has worked so hard to overcome his shyness The clinics were so small when he first started he would offer to haul the horses for free just to get em to go to his clinic And he couldnt have eye contact with you mean he was very shy and to see him work that hard to overcome that and think it amazes him to this day that people want to even listen to what he has to say Ray used to say that he thought horsemen were born but an average person can be extraordinary at this But if you dont have any guts if you dont have any try youd be damn lucky to be ordinary Cows mooing Youre gonna find out what its like to actually use a horse and how nice they can be when they get used To work a horse properly on a cow thats the coolest feeling there is Let the games begin want you to be able to learn things and do things in real life if you were on a ranch where you had a job to do Its one turn and then a race One turn and then a race Give him a job Figure out how to build on the horses pride Make him feel good about himself And wasnt just talking about the horse Reata thats good Nice nice Mary As long as you can stay between your cow and the herd youre in charge Dang out m out See what happens when youre married to him Britt youre up Go move that cow Theres really nothing more fun than chasing cows at top speed and just trying to react Thats crazy fun but thats not really what youre supposed to do So its this constant battle to bring it back to some place thats controlled Stop See you turned without stopping You know thats the other half of why this is a really interesting thing cause it carries over into every other aspect of your life and think its made me a more resourceful and balanced human being on top of just less likely to get killed on a horse love working cattle with my dressage horses think its fabulous for them because dressage is a sport where there are really fine ballettype movements that youre asking the horse to do It gives meaning and purpose to the dressage work and then when you take that purpose back into the dressage ring the horse says m practicing working cows and it makes sense to the horse and then he will do it with a greater joy because it has meaning to him Its not simply an exercise And think that dressage work gives the cow horse skills that even cowboys could use Cattle mooing There you go Horses get discouraged by riders who shut the doors and Bucks really good at opening doors And you get to artwork or anything else that you do you start to look at it for the open doors and then you learn how to walk through those You guys want to throw a few heel shots knew that Buck was really a special guy and because of his background which learned about and the abuse that he had suffered as a kid it was even more impressive that he could come through that abuse and rather than repeating it that he went the other way and decided m not gonna have that in my life Bill ll start with you first Whats your stage name Smokie Brannaman Smokie Brannaman And how about you Dan Whats your stage name They call me Buckshot and m seven years old Well who taught you to perform Our father did And thats Ace Brannaman right Did he ever do this type of thing Was he did he ever do The way my dad treated me when was little the way he approached us as kids Weve arranged a short demonstration right fellas wouldnt attribute any of my positive virtues to my dad in any way whatsoever know youre not supposed to hate anybody but the hurt that he caused me never really got over it So live in the moment like to live in the moment You worry about yesterday or last week or years ago its not gonna work out too good for you You cant live in two places at once You know mean you never forget but you dont have to keep living in the past mean theres a whole bunch of things learned from all the dark stuff that happened to me Theres a hell of a lot of things learned Now wouldnt necessarily recommend it to anybody but it made me what am Yeah it got a little warm there for a while today didnt it Thank goodness my daughter shes never gone through anything like that and now shes almost grown up so You can just saddle them inside the round corral think if a kid is living in an environment like was when was little sometimes the way you protect yourself is you just really dont communicate with anybody and you try your best not to be noticed and you just sort of withdraw and youll see a horse sometimes that theyve been mashed on by somebody to where you just look in their eyes and they look like theyre dead Yet thats the time when you try to encourage your kid to be outgoing and gregarious and be able to talk to not only other kids but adults Then just see if you can lope him right out of his tracks cause thats what you might have to do if youre gonna jump out of your tracks on a cow or something You know what mean There Laughs He got it He kind of got it done in spite of you didnt he Dang it Well make a cowgirl out of you yet Youre only doing this so you can laugh Laughs Reata and are an awful lot alike Thank goodness she kind of has her mothers looks Mentally shes a lot like am You know Maryll say sometimes in frustration Shes just like you and think Whats the downside to that Laughs But she may not be seeing it just that way at the time And look at her and the way shes developed and think probably could have been that way when was her age That was in there all the while Do it again There That was a little better Yeah could feel it Buck either before you get settled or when you get settled you signed these books last year and need a translation Its Spanish or Latin Latin Solvitur en modo Firmitur en ray Gentle in what you do firm in how you do it Yep Good words How are you Charlene Nice to see you Its good to see you wanted to tell you was all signed up to ride with you and a couple of weeks before the clinic found out m having a baby Well all right Good for you always learn even when m watching Good all right Okay you guys can come on over near the round corral here where you can get a good chance to see ll work with this one first here Evidently hes a little naughty guess you can see a little disrespect there huh He had to come up and stick his nose right in my face So ll work with him and well see the same things on about all the colts but Dan This guys a paint and he was an orphan as a baby and he was oxygendeprived apparently Dan do you want to which way do you guys want to bring him in m gonna talk to Buck see if he wants him or not He may want to cause that horse might hold up the whole progress of the whole class So wait until noon So he might want to wait until yeah when its convenient for Buck Maybe even after the whole deal dont know think we have a problem child we have to work yet All right you can bring that one on in Dan They make it sound like theyre bringing in a Siberian tiger Was he hard to catch even in the trailer Dan He just kind of wanted to be a little aggressive in there Bite maybe Uhhuh Just a lot of threatening you know How old is he Hes three Uhhuh how much have you worked with him got my back broken in two places So he has not been handled So he was more or less raised like an orphan Yeah Those can be the worst kind The orphans are always the worst cause they dont learn anything about respect that they would have learned from their mother or from other horses They dont respect anything or anybody You know people thought should put him down They thought maybe he had some brain damage Hes extremely dangerous and he attacks cars m sure youre anxious to get that one in here Dan Dont get hit Step in behind him there When he was an orphan didnt have a barn cause my house burned down and my barn burned down So raised him It was cool so raised him in the house It was cold and l so bottlefed him every couple of hours And l how do you say it pottytrained him It started out a good relationship Its just somebody else has to come in and help me Hes different And hes a stud too Yeah d do that the sooner the better mean it looks to me like the last thing you need is a damn stud If youre gonna have one a lot of you guys you just as well get you a grizzly bear an orangutan ve known Buck for over years and ve seen one other horse besides Kelly a stallion that stands out but ve never ever witnessed anything quite like that that dangerous and unpredictable Is somebody planning on trimming his feet someday Yeah Any shoers here Come on you cowards You want to shoe him right now or would you rather got him a little better Youre booked Cause Dans gonna saddle him and ride him around here in a minute lot of you that dont understand much about a rope youll find out can stop him and thats gonna come in handy for you Dan When youre on him youre gonna be real glad that can stop him once you understand how much more control have by hind foot than would by a halter on his head You already know you cant control him with a halter on his head cause hes been chewing on people and has already been aggressive and wanting to attack people Hey want you guys to understand You cant hold it against him for kind of how his life has been Little bit hell lead soft Okay Dan you can come on in Were just gonna kind of love on him for right now You just kind of ease up beside him and just pet him Come on over with your blanket Youll just go up and rub him Yeah good Good Go get your saddle And you kind of while his frame of mind is kind of humble like that you can cuddle him and kind of love on him too so just pet him on the hind leg Now just see if you can just gently pick up the hoof Thats the way There you go You can go around the front Rub him on his face there when hes being a good guy Watch him though Block him when he wants to bite you block block Thats the biggest thing is nobodys ever blocked him We had to put up a sign that says attack horse because if somebody did walk into the pasture he would have taken em out One time some people started teasing him and went up to him about feet away in this golf cart thinking that would bring him away from the fence and instead he looked back at me pinned his ears ducked his head and did that aggressive horse behavior and came right at me Going striking feet everything and he pretty much came up over the golf cart and nailed me Now go for a little walk with him Now were gonna stop him Pet him Youre the good cop there Dan You just love on him Rub him down that hind leg Looks good Just get on him like hes Grandmas horse All right Pick your lead rope up so its not dragging there So you can kind of bend him if you need to to the left Pet him You just rub him all over like youre just totally in love There you go Okay walk off again Yeah go ahead just say Come on Lets go Yeller There you go Pet him Pet him when he goes see You got to remember that Now maybe we can lope him You got an opportunity There Go ahead Go on Pet him Pet him Rub him on the butt We dont want him to think every time he feels anything back there hes just gonna get whacked Good job m gonna stop you now Okay you can step off him nice and clean This isnt open for discussion At this point Dan is the only one permitted to lead this horse anywhere and then later on maybe a little short evening session you can work him on the end of your lead rope in here when its just you and him by yourself was really embarrassed because he said nobody should have a stud horse and m thinking God if he only knew had a whole pasture full at home that have and then he said not letting him get his head over so he can bite well its healed up pretty well but m gonna have that the rest of my life yeah You know have thousands of horses under my belt and lots of experience And hell the safest place around this son of a bitch is on him You felt fine when you were on him But around him on the ground hes treacherous cause of what hes you know gotten to be And he could hurt Dan or me or you or anybody else just in being spoiled and he doesnt want to be that way but he doesnt know any other way to be Hes as close to having been turned into a predator as youre gonna find Horse whinnying Cause hes hes been wrecked d want to give the older horses a chance to get him some manners Hes run with some studs and they take Youre nuts for having that many studs running together lady m telling you that Most people dont need studs and for Gods sake they dont need of them dont know what youre trying to prove And if you got a lot going on in your life probably a lot of its a lot bigger story than this horse Yeah You ought to be a team member or something as much risk as you like to take Why dont you learn how to enjoy your life Lifes too damn short This horse tells me quite a bit about you So this is just an amplified situation of what is Maybe there maybe there are some things for you to learn about you that maybe the horses is gonna be the only damn way youre gonna learn it cause you might not listen to somebody else Well thats all right Sometimes dont either and should Ask my wife love the horses but have a responsibility to my fellow human too you know if think maybe you might do something to get yourself hurt and you dont even see it coming if see it coming l you know have a moral obligation to say youre in big trouble here Sound fair Okay Hes right mean hes right you know Hes right and m not Its not just the horse Hes hes right about my life Yeah Horse whinnies So Dan if you feel safer just roping him can you rope him need to get my horse kind of warmed up a little bit Dan Dan Dan Watch out Hey hey hey hey hey Hes a psychopath Get out Youre bleeding really bad He got you in the head Get out Thats it Youre done You got it Here Dan Hop down Just hop down Well need to stay here know know know m sorry m sorry Dan youve got a huge hole You need sutures Its a huge hole Thats pretty bad and you always carry something with you just in case m gonna have to put him down You want a ride in and throw some stitches on No no Not your chin Oh look what he did to my hat He bit you He bit you in the head Holy shit Then he knocked me over Okay go sit down in my moms car right there Why Cause m taking you to get stitches Its deep You could see the bone in the Big fuss they make about it just get it cleaned and closed Mr Brannaman you need to talk a little sense into Dan and figure youre probably the only one that can do it Dang About the third time got that saddle blanket up over his back boy didnt even see him man He hit me with his teeth boy and knocked me flat Get it stitched up What you gonna do Were gonna have to put him down wont give him off to somebody whos gonna beat him to a pulp with a x Its not something you do and he hes dangerous m gonna put him down and thats the most humane thing to do for him Yeah Get out of there Dan Dan Dan Dan Hey Yeah do not get close to him Step back away from him Is Buck coming Yeah Please step back away from him was just backing up to get the shot Horse whinnies How are they gonna get him in that trailer Come on Kel Buck clears throat Come on Kel Come on Just sit still Just wait Sighs Come on Kel Come on Kel Come on Up Sit still Just sit still Just sit still Just dont do anything Gate clattering Okay well see if you have any questions here Well ll talk to you right now The colt when it was born was not breathing when they got to it and they didnt know for how long So the vet even figured that the horse had been oxygendeprived for quite a long period of time but he still could have made it in spite of his handicap that he was born with He could have made it If you just would treat this as if that horse because of the oxygen deprivation had some sort of a learning disability Well number one they should have worked with him like you might work with a disabled child and said Look you might need a little bit of extra education because of where youre coming from So you could have taken that disabled child and turned him into something of value to himself and everyone else and he may have ended up just a kind nice little horse that didnt have a lot to offer mentally but was just kind of okay with people and he might have packed someone around He might have been the absolute opposite of what he is But you know damn good and well she would go home and she would either get hurt get killed or someone else would get hurt that was totally innocent The human failed that horse The human is that factor That horse is a mirror All your horses are a mirror to your soul And sometimes you might not like what you see in the mirror Sometimes you will What were you thinking when you were just being so kind and patient with that horse to get him in there instead of just Youre no good shut the door and go To have contempt for the horse never would even occur to me Thats not Maybe maybe years ago it would have maybe One of the biggest challenges of a horseman is is to be able to control your emotions and its a you know probably more of a challenge for me has been you know not so much now but it has been because my dad had a violent temper He was a terrifying person So that kind of followed me around a little bit thinking Am gonna be just like that old fart you know No No you got a choice You can make choices You cant blame the whole damn thing on somebody else And you know cant help but think that all you guys here when you have a youngster that youre gonna be thinking Hoo hoo hoo ve got some responsibility m gonna take care of things and try to make this as good a life for him as can and not let things get out of hand and teach him something hope hope Engine revving So were headed from Chico to Red Bluff to the stock horse and ranch roping contest there The Californios is the deal every year in Red Bluff Buckaroo vaquerostyle roping this is it Reatas doing the kids class They call it the heritage class Shes really looking forward to that and thisll be her last year to do the kids class Then shell be too old The Californios is one of the highlights of my dads season cause hes been on the road traveling living in his horse trailer meeting a bunch of new people having to memorize their names So think it is definitely one of his highlights She won this event last year Reata Brannaman and shes showing a lot of these guys how to throw that thing Thats about the most fun for me is out there roping with my daughter She wants to be She emulates everything her dad does She wants to be just like him Shes her fathers daughter We did teach her how to ride but it was already in her She could ride from the very beginning mean the very first time ever watched her rope thought Whos been teaching you Okay were good to go Reata Brannaman and her lovely assistant Yes lovely assistant The way this works is theyve got seven minutes to do this Cheers and applause Yeah Yeah Gee shes a handy kid Outropes most men now Therell come a time when shell be beating me and thatll be fine Itll be time to turn it over to her Then ll just sit around in the grandstands and talk about all the stuff used to be But hopefully thatll be about another years People say theyre too old when theyre like and you think Shut up Too old Bill Dorrance was roping when he was Thats how want to be when grow up if ever do Oh its always neat to see them after ve been gone for a long time yeah But its always hard to leave too You know once youre around them for a few days kind of start getting used to being around them Then you go back to your life of solitude So m still on the move m getting better because m still studying still want to be a better horseman ve learned so many things and thought originally was just gonna be there to figure out how to get a colt started and figure out how to be a little better cowboy Thats what thought it was about Come to find out that wasnt what it was about at all Out of a group like this there might be some who become artists where you become creative and you use your imagination Now that was a thing of beauty You look like one mind and one body If you got a taste of it if you got a taste of what m talking about you couldnt get enough of it Youd rather do that than eat You may spend your whole life chasing that and thats possible but its a good thing to chase This is Bucks favorite joke Its a pirate scene and the guy up in the crows nest says One enemy ship coming on the horizon And the captain says Quick bring me my red shirt because if get wounded in battle the blood wont show and my men will fight on So they had the battle and after a bit the guy in the crows nest says Ten enemy ships on the horizon And the captain says Quick bring me my brown pants Laughter Cheers and applause Soft acoustic guitar music Yes understand that every life must end Uhhuh As we sit alone know someday we must go Uhhuh Oh m a lucky man to count on both hands The ones love Some folks just have one Yeah others they got none Uhhuh Stay with me Lets just breathe Practiced on our sins Never gonna let me win Uhhuh Under everything just another human being Uhhuh Yeah
