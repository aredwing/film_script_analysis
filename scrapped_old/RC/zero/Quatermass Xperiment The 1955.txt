danger Members of the public however are warned to stay away from the area will repeat that The Home Office stresses that there is no immediate danger Do you realize what youll have to face if this turns out to be a disaster Quatermass How much further miles sir Quatermass m talking to you For the last miles ve been painfully aware of that Well that answered that How did it happen What went wrong For the first time in the history of the world man has sent a rocket miles into space You cant expect such an experiment to be perfect Well you must have had some ideas m a scientist not a fortuneteller who predicts what will happen Well you had instrument radio contact We lost it for over hours sir Poor old Glooseman dont even know how far its been It had no further contact even when it return to the orbit Yet you brought it down by your own control Well thats something to tell your ministry Create a mess set it up and he brought it back Please Oh please Couldnt you pick some other time for this m sorry Mrs Carroon happened to be concerned with the Ministry of Defense And m not a civil servant m a doctor And happened to be concerned with men The men who are in that rocket Oakley Green this is it Certainly no secret Sorry no ones allowed past this point Ministry of Defense Oh yes sir Alright there open up Sorry Miss you will have to keep back Hoi Miss Hey you have to

of Defense ll get the inspector Try and get through to them Marsh Right sir Get the temperature reading Why dont you go and wait in the car Judith Its funny It looks exactly the same Yet its been who knows how far There isnt a word Hello hello This is Marsh Hello Carroon Green Reichenheim You receive me Over Keep trying Mr Blake m Quatermass ll be in charge from here on inspector Cant say m sorry

four hours suppose youd like me to open it up right now huh One blast of air in against that heat will incinerate them Sir reporters have arrived Theyd like some facts Theyll get some later Theyll get some now Bring them on Major Dont you think we ought to find out a few more ourselves first Bring them on Major Are you hearing me Are you hearing me This is Marsh calling over You know if ever gave them all the facts youd find one or two of them difficult to explain Dont try and drag me through the mud Blake you might splash a little bit on yourself you and your committee You deliberately launched that rocket without waiting for official sanction If the whole world waited for official sanction it would be standing still You took too long made my own decision To gamble with mens lives Every experiment is a gamble The unknown is always a risk They should know that Did she know that That woman over there waiting hoping and praying It dropped another degrees since we arrived We still got a long way to go Lets hope that insulation lining doesnt crack up Yes lets hope it didnt Because if it did Quatermass and those men in there are dead Dead or alive theyll be heroes Let me tell you something Blake Theyll fire the imagination so that therell be a men begging for the same privilege when we launch the second rocket You cant stop it now You mean cant stop you now Thats right This is Marsh calling Do you hear me Over Theres nothing sir Nothing Quatermass You know what youve done launched it and brought it back thats quite an achievement think And those men Quiet What is it Marsh

bring him out dead Door control set sir Hold it Wheres that fire chief Get an ambulance move in You want me sir Yes Round up every man and piece of machinery youve got Move it in there as close as

find out Go bring the camera down Do you think the door opened and they were swept away If the door had opened itd be registered here No that door has not been opened till now What are you just trying

Reichenheim What happened Please not now Quatermass He is in no condition to talk Hes in truth still in a state of shock He must be treated Hes got to talk first Hes got to tell me what happened Gordon What is it Victor What is it He said help me Thats all he said Help me You get it Yes sir Good Alright so hes just making any but he got a lump state with the wife Any special reason Uh huh my favourite day of the month Payday Oh m a big man on payday Yes sir See the papers Quatermass Still to get up for the police How dare he take fingerprints from a sick man Theres nothing else they could do He couldnt talk couldnt answer any questions Thought it would be might as well get his prints You never know No you never know Hes a weird one alright Skin it just like shaking hands with a piece of ice Sergeant thats no way to talk about a public hero Come in Mr Quatermass to see you sir Well speaking of public heroes Alright bring him in Yes sir Quatermass heh This is whats known as penetrating into enemy territory Inspector Lomax m Lomax This is Sergeant Best Wont you sit down ll come direct to the point Inspector will not have your men coming into my research center and treating Victor Carroon as though he were a pathological criminal No he Hes a sick man Inspector Hes been through an ordeal that very few man could survive Two men didnt survive it did they Mr Quatermass What exactly do you mean by that wish youd sit down If sit and you stand m being rude m longing to sit down You see Mr Quatermass m an oldfashion sort of chap dont know much about rockets or travelling in space dont read science fiction m a plain simple bible man have a routine mind and have to do routine things Such as fingerprinting an unconscious man When men take off in a rocket and only one comes back in our reckoning that leaves minus And minus puts us in an embarrassing position having to investigate plus Now whether he is conscious unconscious or a gibbering idiot Fine guess that can save you a lot of time Inspector with your so called investigation have here the particulars on all members of the crew Charles Green Ludwig Reichenheim Victor Carroon Youll find everything there Inspector Medical histories personal descriptions academic achievements professional activities politics and even fingerprints Well that is very thoughtful of you There is only one investigation likely to serve any good purpose in this situation Inspector Thats the scientific one m sure even you will agree that between us am the best qualified for that assignment Good day Inspector Sergeant Well we might all well say weve been given a ride Yes sir Its absolutely unbelievable It just isnt clinically possible that his heart should just pump like this Pulse blood pressure the same Impossibly low He shouldnt be alive but he is Cant you do something to increase the metabolic rate Tried everything No effect never knew pressure effects to last this long Well these arent just pressure effects Take a look at his face take a look at the skin Anyway here on the shoulder Feel it Swollen coarsened Yes and thats not all either Look at the contour of the face You mean the bone structure Yes it could be rather limp but not about the shape of the bones Theres been a change m convinced of that Is he any better Hes coming along fine If only hed say something Give us a sign that hes thinking that he knows were here He knows Judith He knows were trying to help him What is happening to him Well thats what were trying to find out Shouldnt he be in a hospital Thats exactly where he should be Briscoe cant take this responsibility any longer havent got the proper equipment here to do the right tests He belongs in a hospital Well suppose youre right suppose youre both right He does belong in a hospital But can a hospital do more than you can do Would a hospital know what goes on out there in space On the other side of the earth its a whole new would out there wilderness uncharted And hes been there and come back Hes got the map Unlock his mind for me Briscoe and find it know you can do it It isnt just the know the strain and tension youve been under But to stop now when were so close On the brink of something tremendous The very fringe of some great discovery We cant stop now Briscoe Besides its our only chance to learn what happened to the others At the hospital you have almost Does the hospital know how to deal with a man whos been exposed to rocket radiation It is that she knows that Or the effects of pressure at miles up During flight training it took times the force of gravity without even a headache We know that But would a hospital know it Well ll try another transfusion see if that will help Thanks Youll stay with him wont you Judith He needs you Victor am going to move him into the office We can make him more comfortable in there Would you help me please Of course Thank you for all youre doing Gordon Aye only wish could do more The solution is elementary my dear Inspector Victor Carroon killed the two men removed their pressure suits pushed their bodies out into space and then linked the suits together again Now what do you want Two things Number want to return these files Green Reichenheim Carroon Very interesting Carroon Number Well want you to give me your solemn word Well Inspector m a very busy man Now look sir nobody ever wins a cold war One of us must come over to the other side You dont want to come over to mine m not proud ll come over to yours Solemn word about what That these were Carroons fingerprints Of course they were Everybody in gets fingerprinted What are you getting at Ahh to be quite honest dont quite know sir Nothing unusual about these These are the fingerprints we took off Carroon last night What about them Compare them Is this a joke This is no joke sir The man who took those had his training in the fingerprint section second nature to him But these prints arent even human Yes Yeah You found what ll be right there Well wherever youre going might as well keep you company mightnt Thank you Very nice of you Mr Lionel has checked the specification of the wiring Right there Can you get at it No Its right in a crevice Hand me the samples spoon in that box Any more of it Yes sir lots On the left by the rivet there Mind if we have a sample for our people Sure well give you a sample Briscoe what do you think it is do not know a thing m not sure ve been in this thing all night smell theres such thing around the whole town Can have that lamp You got the same bright thoughts that have Something happened in here Something beyond our understanding at the moment If only knew where to begin Maybe the film will help Film Guess the lab should have developed it by now thought you told me the camera was smashed It was rather damaged but managed to get the film out Why didnt you tell me The lab said they didnt know if they could develop it or not Theyve got to develop it You get right down to that laboratory and tell them theyve got to develop that film Yes sir And ll have no delays or excuses Tell them to get the best process man in the company Tell them to get anybody they want but ve got to have that film Right sir This is one frankly dont want to miss Well Its harmless its organic its jelly End of analysis No definite identification It might conceivably represent the dead remnants of cell tissue What sort of cell tissue Could be animal could be human Human Could have been Do you know what youre saying know what m thinking Are you sure its not some sort of plant cell Positive You mean to say that youre asking me to believe that that is the remains of two human beings m not asking you to believe anything You asked a question answered it Does she know No its the best sleep shes had in nights What about the police analyst What do they say No report through yet But dont doubt it will be the same Its almost beyond human understanding Some fantastic invisible force converted two men into jelly Is that the slide Thats the slide m about to call it a day Quatermass Beyond this m a Gordon Alright get him up No wait a minute His hand another change Get him back to bed Look whats happening to his skin in just the last few moments ll go and get him a sedative Youve done it to him Hed been better off if hed been killed and stayed out there Judith Youve destroyed him like you destroyed everything else youve touched Destroyed him ve brought him back ve saved him Saved him for what For further experiments can help him more than you or anyone else can Theres no room for personal feelings in science Judith Some of us have a mission You should be very proud to have a husband whos willing to risk his life for the betterment of the whole world What world Your world The world of Quatermass have sent for an ambulance Hes going to the Central Clinic Alright Briscoe Send them to the clinic But want them to have complete isolation you understand Complete isolation No one is to see them No one until say so Weve tried three different grade of stock developed each one to its higher gamma as possible and still its made no difference Look at this Its grainy and dark All want is a print Well we dont like any print that isnt up to standard Is there a picture of it Oh theres a picture alright But you can see how dull and grainy dont care how dull and grainy it is must have this now It could be altitude or an extreme change of temperature or penetration of cosmic rays Fine fine ll tell him that Well dont know what the old man will say Listen you tell your old man that our old man says if he didnt get this print hed dynamite the building cant tell the Ministry this Theyll think lost my senses Thats exactly why you must tell them nothing Now you see why must have absolute authority to isolate Carroon But every newspaper in town has got a story on him being admitted into the clinic Theyll want to know why and whats happened to him on whats happened to the others Alright do you want to tell him But not telling them wont stop the panic What they dont know wont start a panic Inspector what about the police analysis The same Mr Blake Well whats the next move Oh weve agreed to isolation There isnt anything we can do until we know more Yeah The film is ready See that Marsh it works Yes sir What works Automatic prism It touch on the panel reading What Is that all Once in the observation zone the cameras geared to cut out at regular intervals This will be at That must be where we lost them What the hell could have happened Look at
