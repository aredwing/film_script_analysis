do it alone While it lives no one is safe My son What are you about to do Would you destroy that which your father dedicated his life to creating must The monster you created is in itself destruction Nevertheless was near to solving a problem that has baffled man since the beginning of time the secret of life artificially created But it has brought death to everything that its touched That is because unknowingly gave it a criminal brain With your knowledge of science you can cure that Its beyond my cure Its a malignant brain What if it had another brain Another brain Bohmer Dr Bohmer What is it Doctor Youve changed your mind Yes Attach the highfrequency leads to the terminal electrodes Yes sir Frankenstein Come in Ygor may need your assistance You have agreed You are going to help him Doctor You are giving him life Yes but not for the purpose that you think Ygor m giving him strength so that an operation may be successful An operation Yes m giving him another brain You must explain

that is good No You cannot take my friend away from me Hes all that have nothing else Youre going to make him your friend and will be alone It will be as say or he must be destroyed He cannot be destroyed There is one way By dissection No Not that Doctor Ygors bodys no good His neck is broken crippled and distorted lame and sick from the bullets your brother fired into me You can put my brain in his body Your brain You can make us one Well be together always my brain and his body together Youre a cunning fellow Ygor Do you think that d put your sly and sinister brain into the body of a giant That would be a monster indeed Youll do as tell you or ll not be responsible for the consequences Ironic isnt it Doctor Yes the monsters victim shall inherit his body And everlasting life Build up the voltage potential to its maximum It all seems so weird and ghastly cant stand it any longer tell you Elsa And you Father somethings happened to you It seems as if a great cloud has come over you You dont seem like my father at all You must trust me my dear You must realise my problem One thing can assure you The monster will never trouble anyone again Good morning was wondering Doctor

see He is the first time happy in his life Good Take good care of him today shall operate tonight All right No Not now Tonight So youre going to let Frankenstein do this operation to put the brain of his friend into our friend Our friend Yeah You the great Dr Bohmer who taught Frankenstein everything he knows How would you like to be the leader of your profession in this state The head of the medical commission The regent of the university You weave a pretty fairy tale crooked neck How could that be accomplished You will see to it that the brain of Kettering does not go into the head of the monster But why My brain will go into it You fool youd die Die will live again Only this crooked body will die will live forever My brain in that body would make me a leader of men We would rule the state and even the whole country Youll do as say and you will have everything you want Good evening Doctor Good evening Good evening Erik Good evening Were awfully sorry to disturb you Weve called regarding the escaped maniac Well The countrysides been combed Every barn and haystacks been searched and the neighbouring villages have been notified But he and his companion have disappeared completely It seems that youve done all that is possible creature like that couldnt pass long unnoticed Obviously someones offering him refuge What are you trying to insinuate Erik Perhaps you would care to search the estate warn you if you contemplate such presumption you will not be welcome here in the future as my guest That wont be necessary If youll permit me to have a few words with Dr Kettering Unfortunately Dr Kettering has had to leave suddenly owing to illness in his family He was here yesterday evening saw him Quite so He left early this morning You were at the station to watch the morning train Dr Kettering was not on the morning train ll have to risk your displeasure Doctor We will search the premises Very well This is my laboratory gentlemen Inspect the walls and flooring for secret passageways Very good Mr Ernst Will you guide us Doctor believe that leads to an old dungeon Why certainly Whats that room Doctor An auxiliary operating room maintained at a very low temperature Its not in use now Will you lead us Doctor It would seem that this room has been recently occupied Doctor Youre familiar with my work keep this room ready at all times for the more violently insane You can see that it is not occupied now Yes My apologies Doctor warned you that you might regret this action Are you mad Why did you let him get away Let him You think had any idea what he was going to do Or that could stop him The police have searched the place for him Then its good that we were gone Frankensteins been half insane He wants to operate tonight The child complicates matters Leave that to me He will have to be told Ygor will explain to him No you do not understand It will kill her You wouldnt want to kill your little friend But Ygor has a better idea You will see You will have the brain of your friend Ygor Tonight my brain will be your brain Tonight Ygor will die for you Help Elsa Where are you going m going out to find Erik In this storm Yes Father cant Father what does he want m going to operate to give him a new brain He wants the brain of that child Take me home Please take me home Father Surely youre not going to Take the child in there quickly How did the patient react to the anaesthetic Surprisingly well particularly the spinal think can safely say everything is ready Dr Bohmer our respective operations must be timed with the utmost precision Any delay in the transfer will mean failure Exactly sir Shall proceed Yes must warn you this operation may not be successful This may be the end of everything Better death than a life like this now that have seen the promise of a life forever Ketterings brain What will he think when he resumes life in that body Will he thank us for giving him a new lease on life Or will he object to finding his ego living in that human junk heap Theres no sign of returning consciousness yet Doctor anticipated this Let me know immediately if theres a change in his condition Certainly sir Dr Bohmer can never thank you sufficiently for your assistance and skill This may bring you the recognition which has long been due to you Thats very nice of you sir None of us will be safe Whos he going to get next Fellow townsmen its two weeks since my little daughter disappeared Its the common belief that she perished when my house was burned down But a search was made of the ashes and no bones were found She was stolen stolen by the fiend who murdered Carl and Josef Weve searched the hills the mountains and the forests and he cant be found Why cant he be found Why cant the police find him Theres a very good reason Hes being harboured protected by someone Theres only one person that would protect a maniac like that Who Dr Frankenstein Lets go to Frankenstein and choke the truth out of him Mr Ernst Theyre on their way to Dr Frankenstein Stop Stop right where you are When did you decide to take the law into your own hands When we found out we couldnt get any help from you Two men have been murdered and we want that maniac My little child has been stolen The law in Vasaria has done everything in its power to apprehend this monster Maybe Dr Frankenstein can tell us where he is Nothings to be gained by hasty action Nothings to be gained by waiting either when the prosecutors in love with Frankensteins daughter That has nothing to do with my duty Let me have a few moments alone with Dr Frankenstein If hes concealing this monster he must be made to give him up If he refuses you can take any action you want to Does that sound fair to you men d like to see Dr Frankenstein He isnt seeing anyone Hell have to see me Erik What are those people doing at the gates Theyre demanding to see your father Why What do they want with him They think he knows something about the monsters disappearance What can we do ve got to see him before they do or cant be responsible for the consequences What is it you want The villagers are getting out of hand If you expect the protection of my office youll have to be frank There are certain matters which must be clarified What do you mean The case of Dr Kettering He did not return home He wasnt even expected there He did not leave Vasaria by train as you intimated Your servants say his clothes are still in his room which is locked by your orders think the times come for a showdown Doctor Perhaps youre right Erik Come with me May have a word with you Yes sir It is imperative that we see the patient What is his condition His recuperative powers have proved tremendous He appears to have complete control of all his faculties Why did you deny that you were concealing the monster Doctor It was necessary for a while You see Erik the monster as you know was a homicidal maniac He killed Dr Kettering but Dr Kettering lives again His brain is now inside the skull of the monster have replaced an evil brain with a good one have made amends for the great tragedy that my father and brother unintentionally brought to this community ve restored the good name of Frankenstein Let me show you Hes been in there long enough We may be losing valuable time All right men hes had his chance Now its our turn Come on Do you recognise me Tell me who am You are Dr Frankenstein And you are You are Dr Kettering am not Dr Kettering am Ygor What have done am Ygor have the strength of a hundred men cannot die cannot be destroyed Ygor will live forever ve created a hundred times the monster that my father made Bohmer This is your work Dont touch him Frankenstein Hes my friend should kill you Frankenstein But after all your father gave me life and you gave me a brain Its the townspeople cant offer you protection now Bohmer turn on the gas Fill the house with it Well kill all of them Get back You may all be killed Theyre turning on the gas Bohmer You must be mad Leave him alone My dear told you it was Dr Frankenstein Find him Get out of the house Hurry But what about Father ll go back for him Bohmer cant see Bohmer Where are you Here am cant see you Your dream of power is over Bohmer You didnt realise his blood is the same type as Ketterings but not the same as Ygors It will not feed the sensory nerves Bohmer You played me a trick What good is a brain without eyes to see What good is a brain without eyes
