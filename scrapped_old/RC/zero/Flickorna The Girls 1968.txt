gloves yet The cloakroom is closed for another know we all want to go home have a bite and go to bed but arent there things more important than food and sleep mean this is something that concerns us all Is it possible to change people and the world we live in You tell me Can we change ourselves Thats why Aristophanes wrote this play To get things moving to make people care and to make us to stop us sitting around believing we can do nothing There are things we can do Above all he wants us to stop thinking that were so marvellous Youre sitting here now completely satisfied with yourselves What youve just seen was a trifle comedy nothing to take seriously real classic scholarly and nice but nothing you give athought You sit as if you were made of wood Say something Dont you see We have to talk Stop being so embarrassed and critical People have to be able to talk Dont you understand that its we who make the world what it is What Another revolt among the women What happened was it planned Are you going on like this The press conference is in there What did you say to stop her What Another revolt among the women Theyre always fussing dissatisfied wanting to change everything Theyve got nothing to complain about think you should askher Theyre out of their minds They yelled poured water on us It looked as if wed wet ourselves came as a government official to collect money

Wheres the police Arrest her Touch me and therell be one less public servant to serve the public Scared now Grab her men Tie herup What were you trying to say wanted to change things a bit What things wanted to get people to talk Any reaction No Did you expect them to talk d hoped Was it just to make contact with the audience or Do you really believe in Lysistratas method Its one way dont know if its the right one Didnt you reach them during the play Yes And thought they might talk The world situation worries you Yes More precisely Vietnam South Africa or what Is there any political involvement behind it Of course one cares what happens to people and about world peace m not a politician but since m in this play now and shestrying to do something How do you see it What do we do What do you ask of an audience that wants a nice evening at the theater hoped it wasnt just nice to have a nice time thought it might be nice to talk about ones reactions sometimes Didnt you get it across in the play Wasnt that enough You expected them to answer Whereareyou girls All you aunts and grannies sisters and sweethearts Knock them Sock them Kick them Fix them Do your worst What do you want me to say What do you want me to do Do you demonstrate otherwise too Yes Do you sign petitions Now and then But why tonight Thats not the point Why did you react tonight is it something personal Has anything special happened No But of course its personal m personally involved in this Politically involved want people to get on and stop fighting Are you politically involved Yes but not well informed Dont you like the play as it is Its wonderful Your part you mean No the play But you want to change it No its myself want to chamge Thats my wife Dont you understand Whats got into her Get them girls Stop it Thats enough Dont go too far even if its fun My men are defeated Extremely embarrassing Dont you think women like success too You gasbag Youre supposed to be a leader Why talk to idiotic women Whatdid Liz actually do to cause all that fuss in the papers She began taking things seriously Seriously Almost ve never had anything against women No but they obviously have a lot against us Liz really knows how to cause a commotion Marianne always wanted chamge You dont say Gunilla was never content Her too Do you know what think dont think women ever existed At least weve always behaved as if they didnt Whats the matter with you loved her Nonsense Didnt Of course not Well in that case Gentlemen After todays joyful ceremony we are once again free men At some point in history neednt bother you with details we put women in their place They gave up and henceforth did as they were told We thought that was it but we had nurtured an adder at our breast We thought they were tamed but they started to revolt again They started to speak and have opinions But now gentlemen weve put an end to all that What you now see are the remains a beautiful corpse So you are now at liberty to behave as you wish Without their nagging and interfering You may fight whenever and wherever you like You may kill betray cheat exploit and destroy As much as you want Silence You gasbag Youre supposed to be a leader Why talk to idiotic women What are you proposing to do Take over the treasury You Look after the treasury Whats funny about that manage the housekeeping money Its not the same thing Whats the difference The money is for military purposes Thats just our point We dont want any more wars Then how do we defend the city Well defend you You Thats right Monstrous Whether you
