Your first recital was a sensation Then you disappeared went into the army But afterward Afterward preferred the fresh air of carnivals preferred the dear faces of little children with runny noses Hmm Youve hit on a great idea No thank you combining the live figure with the puppets Where did you find the girl We cant make up our minds whether shes a superb actress or youre a svengali Neither Noshes like a little bell that gives off a pure sound no matter how you strike it because she is in herself so good and true and pure She lives each show loves it Those moments with the puppets are her happiest ll venture to say ll venture to agree Weveweve worked out a basic formula Jacquot Paul and within that framework we try and develop a new show every day Paul could you come back with me to the tent please UhMy associate Jacquot Monsieur Tonit m sorry We like your act Thank you If you can hold these carnival audiences you can hold any The Folies de Paris will be easy Sure Well try it

But we know now m sorry We have to talk about this By all means What do we have to talk over But dont dismiss this offer too lightly The act is nothing without the girl agree Shes enchanting But this one the creativeness is his He has a talent for improvisation that ve never seen before Its close to genius Youve hit on a new career Berthalet thatll outstrip anything you couldve done as a dancer But you must know this or you wouldnt have given up your dancing for it didnt give up anything became a puppeteer because it was the only way could earn enough to feed myself You see a dancer grows conscious of his body When itll no longer do what he wants it to do he grows to hate it So hid mine behind the curtain of a puppet stage m sorry We didnt know Weve been tactless m afraid No Youve done the greatest thing for me you couldve done Tell me again what you said You mean that think youve chosen a new career thatll outstrip anything you mightve done as a dancer But you said that before you knew was lame You meant it meant it and more ll underwrite your new career Thank you Thank you Tomorrow What was that nonsense about letting them know You think to get more money out of them by saying were unwilling said it because m not sure you have an act to sell Lili is leaving What did you do to her Stopped her from making a fool of herself Leaving That childs an idiot Shes not an idiot And she isnt a child any longer Shes beginning to realize the fact that theres cruelty in the world and shes starting to protect herself from it Wellwhat do we do now Youll figure it out Youre the genius

living in a dream just like a little girl without seeing what didnt want to see but you want to know something Marc We sometimes outgrow feelings and ideas just like a little girl outgrows her dresses but somehow it turns out that theres a right time for everything in the right order Theres a time for going to school time for losing our parents and a time for falling in love with a beautiful magician But theres a time for waking up You are a wise girlLili Where did you learn all this We dont learn We just get older and we know Goodbye Marc Goodbye Thank you for your patience Forgive me

fool Melting and sniveling over Reynardo and Carrot Top must be crazy Theyve become so very dear to me forget forget every time that its only you Or is it you Is it Whwhat are you Are you just a monster without any feeling Why cant you ever say a kind word Why do you hide behind those puppets am the puppets m Carrot Top Confident clever capable of running his life and yours and everybody elses And m Golo the Giant Cowardly stupid longing to be loved clumsy and in need of comforting And m Marguerite too Vain jealous obsessed with self looking at my face in the mirror Are my teeth nice Is my hair growing thin And m Reynardo the thief the opportunist full of compromise and lies Like any other man have in me all these things all of these and as many more again Must make a new puppet for the small part of me youve managed to see The monster The angry man The frustrated dancer clumping along with a leg anchored to the ground and a heart anchored to but you dont have to understand me or even like me This is business Not anymore
