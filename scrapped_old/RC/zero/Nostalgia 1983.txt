Nikolayevich ve been in Italy years very important ones both for my profession and for my everyday life Last night had a bad dream had to stage an opera in the theater of My Lord the Count The first act was set in a park full of statues but they were naked men forced to stand motionless And was a statue too knew would be harshly punished if moved because our lord and master was watching us could feel the cold rising from my marble pedestal as the autumn leaves settled on my upraised arm Yet stood still But when sensed could resist no longer awoke was afraid For knew it had been no dream but my reality Yet would die if never returned to Russia if never again saw my homeland the birches the air of my childhood An affectionate greeting from your abandoned friend Pavel Sosnovsky Maria Andrei As a child fell ill from hunger and fear tear shreds of skin from my lips In my memory lick traces of salt of freshness And still walk sit on a doorstep looking for warmth stagger deliriously as to the pipers tune was hot opened my collar and lay down The trumpets sounded light pierced my eyelids High above the pavement mother flies beckons with her hand and flies away Now beneath the appletrees dream of a white hospital As a child fell ill must go and see Dad ve a jacket in the wardrobe Its been there three years ll wear it again when m home in Moscow never go anywhere never see anyone What are you doing here Dont be afraid Dont be afraid of me Its who should be afraid of you You could shoot me Everyone shoots in Italy And there are too many Italian shoes Dreadful Why does everyone buy them These are years old Its not important All right You know of great romances no kisses nothing at all Very pure Hence great Feelings unspoken feelings are unforgettable Here its like in Russia dont know why You know dont speak Italian well Heres a story man saves another who was sinking into a slimy pond thereby risking his own life Now they are both lying on the edge of the pound out of breath exhausted The rescued man says Idiot why did you do that live in there He was offended Whats your name Angela good girl Are you glad About what About life Yes Good girl Sight grows dim my strength is two occult adamantine darts Hearing weavers for my fathers house breathes distant thunder The tissues of hard muscles weaken like hoary oxen at the plough and no longer when night falls do two wings gleam behind me During the party like a candle wasted away Gather up at dawn my melted wax and read in it whom to mourn what to be proud of How by donating the last portion of joy to die lightly and in the shelter of a makeshift roof to light up posthumously like a word Why must think of this have enough worries My God why did do it Theyre my children my family my own flesh and blood How could Years without seeing the sun fearing the light of day Why Why this tragedy Lord do you see how hes asking Say something to him But what would happen if He heard my voice Let Him feel your presence always do but Hes not aware of it ll bring the car around in minutes Mr Gorchakov phone call for you For me Please wait Hello Its Eugenia How are you Fine Guess why called Your Domenico is here the lunatic from Bagno Vignoni No know hes not mad It was so youd understand Hes here in Rome for a demonstration Hes been making speeches for days Come and say goodbye to him m leaving immediately He keeps asking if youve done what you were supposed to do Of course ll tell him right away Thank you m glad we could say goodbye m going away with Vittorio Well probably go to India Vittorios my man hes from a distinguished family in Orvieto Good Eugenia wish you all the best Same to you Say hello to Moscow for me How are you keeping Hows your heart dont know ve reached the limit m bored want to go home Hello Vittorio m going to buy some cigarettes want to change my ticket m leaving in days time Whats happened Nothing Can you drive me to Bagno Vignoni When Now ll have to let Italy know wait right Right Trust him not to leave today What ancestor speaks in me cant leave simultaneously in my head and in my body Thats why cant be just one person can feel myself countless things at once There are no great masters left Thats the real evil of our time The hearts path is covered in shadow We must listen to the voices that seem useless In brains full of long sewage pipes of school wall tarmac and welfare papers the buzzing of insects must enter We must fill the eyes and ears of all of us with things that are the beginning of a great dream Someone must shout that well build the pyramids It doesnt matter if we dont We must fuel that wish and stretch the corners of the soul like an endless sheet If you want the world to go forward we must hold hands We must mix the socalled healthy with the socalled sick You healthy ones What does your health mean The eyes of all mankind are looking at the pit into which we are plunging Freedom is useless if you dont have the courage to look us in the eye to eat drink and sleep with us Its the socalled healthy who have brought the world to the verge of ruin Man listen In you water fire and then ashes And the bones in the ashes The bones and the ashes Wait for me in the car Hello Where am when m not in reality or in my imagination Heres my new pact it must be sunny at night and snowy in August Great things end small things endure Society must become united again instead of so disjointed Just look at nature and youll see that life is simple We must go back to where we were to the point where you took the wrong turn We must go back to the main foundations of life without dirtying the water What kind of world is this if a madman tells you you must be ashamed of yourselves Music now Music forgot this mother The air is that light thing that moves around your head and becomes clearer when you laugh The music doesnt work Zoe Zoe To the memory of my mother
