we have our prisoners and our guards Good afternoon gentlemen am Dr Phil Zimbardo professor of psychology here at Stanford University Welcome to orientation Youre gonna be very pleased to know that you all have been chosen to be the prison guards in this study And that choice was made based upon the exemplary qualities that you all demonstrated during your interviews So good for you This experiment will be an extension of my research into the effects prisons can have on human behavior And being that its summer and the schools almost empty we should have near complete privacy for this study And as youll soon see we have cleared out some of the teachers offices and converted them into prison cells and the hallway will serve as the prison yard But remember just as you are watching the prisoners my graduate staff and will be watching you So under no circumstances whatsoever are you to hit or physically assault the prisoners in any way Now youll all be given sunglasses and uniforms to give the prisoners a sense of a unified singular authority Once a prisoner is jailed he will not be able to leave except under established procedures And from this point forward you should never refer to this as a study or an experiment again lot of these books dont even know where got them The perils of moving in together What are you thinking about The experiment No experiments routine You know m gonna be away for two weeks and then And then you are gonna be starting your new job You make it sound like its in a different state Berkeley is an hour up the road Oh that know Its

himself and m the superintendent of this facility make that decision Nobody else It was late Everything was escalating really quickly Kyle We Did you even stop to think for one second if just like Jesse said yesterday was bullshitting you He wanted a lawyer What is it with these lawyers Oh my God see see Well then why did lose it What did we miss in the screening process mean we missed something We were all there We all screened him He was only in there for two days Yeah but without any sunlight and sleep your sense of time has been totally altered His only weakness was that he resisted He didnt bend so he broke No he broke because he couldnt control the other prisoners just wanted control Even as a prisoner with essentially no rights No Jesses right about that was fine while other people were serving him So what You think if the other prisoners had stuck with him then what John Wayne would have lost Man John Wayne cant lose He served the system served himself m sorry dont buy any of this No dont imagine you would This is bullshit Youre basing your conclusions off your own experience on real felons in a real prison So this is not a prison This is a simulated prison This is college boys whos never been punched in the fucking face Thats what this is think you guys are both missing the point He missing the point m not missing anything You missing something No heres the point The only thing that separates those two was a coin flip All right what steps are being taken to replace Well none as of yet We got Kyle come on Start notifying the alternates immediately okay Okay And find out which ones can start tomorrow Got it Until then what do you want me to tell the prisoners Tell them has been taken to maximum security Get some more fear into them

Hey Hey Youre not even a prisoner at all And thats not a prison Its a hallway With a bunch of empty offices in the basement of Jordan Hall Youre free to go Okay All you have to do is sign a couple of release papers All right Jesus Phil why did you do that Hey he was a lost cause had to say something All this talk about lawyers cant afford any more liabilities m not letting anything get in the way of the progress that we made know understand that And will you make sure that he takes him to Student Health and gets him checked out Yeah Hey did you find a replacement for m trying Its not that easy Theres not that many people left on campus Well get on it Phil Oh ah Hi Hi Oh Oh m so glad you came So this is it Well its quiet right now but it it has been truly extraordinary the way these boys have adapted Its significant Itll get better later tonight Well youre gonna have me around for a while heard about Kyle So m volunteering to take his place on the parole board Thats fantastic Now youll get to see what its really like Like a chimp And then the chimp raped the woman And she had a baby that Youre a liar man No no swear swear Literally every story you tell is a bullshit lie m fucking serious And the baby was half chimp and half human It had like sideburns and shit like those m fucking serious Hey lets go new guy eat up No thank you Mr Correctional Officer Well that is not an option Well m sorry you think that sir Youre sorry Bring me his plate How about you pick up those sausages boy Now you will not leave this closet until those sausages are in your belly Got me believe the correctional staff has convinced me of my many weaknesses Despite my horrible disrespect for them the staff has treated me well now know that every member of the correctional staff is only interested in the wellbeing of the prisoners And believe that because of their goodness have been rehabilitated and transformed into a better human being On a personal note the prisoner adds will turn on Monday This being my last year at Stanford would like to be paroled so that may spend one more birthday with my old friends Sincerely From your request it sounds like youre very happy with your setup here Why do you want parole Well as stated in the request its my rd birthday on Dont you think the prison staff is capable of giving you a birthday party Yes But for sentimental reasons would rather spend You should have thought about that before you broke the law Sir Why are you in prison was charged with assault with a deadly weapon How do you plead Not guilty Not guilty Not guilty So youre saying that the police officers who arrested you didnt know what they were doing that they that there was a mistake that there was some confusion that there No sir m not done speaking Theyre lying is that what your saying Theyre lying Well havent seen any evidence but m sure its probably good if they picked me up for it Then you admit there is some merit to the charges against you Yes There probably is some merit in what theyre saying Yes You do recognize that prisons are for people who break rules and you put your freedom in jeopardy doing exactly which you did Yes and realize that now and find it hard to take the word of a young man with such a checkered history with the law What kind of citizen do you think you can be with these kinds of charges dont understand the question sir m sorry Oh you dont understand you were picked up and later released on suspicion of car theft you were picked up and later released for lack of evidence at a place where narcotics were found you were arrested for passing bad checks Now you tell us that you can make it out there but your behavior dont reflect it nor do your behavior reflect it here Now think that youre destined to be prison scum understand that sir You believe in God Yes sir do Why is that Well because thats just what was taught and You were also taught that assault is against the law Or do you think its legitimate to go around hurting people No sir do not But you stated in your own handwriting My horrible disrespect for them Horrible disrespect Thats hurtful is it not is it not Yes sir it is And what do you think would happen if everybody in this nation disrespected everyone elses person huh dont know really dont know You sicken me you sicken me And to be honest wouldnt parole you if you were the last man here You are the least likely candidate for parole that weve seen Now how do you feel about that Well think that youre entitled to your opinion Well my opinion means something in this particular place think weve heard enough You can take him away have one more question for you Since youve been here youve been performing your duties and accruing a certain salary Tell me would you forfeit your pay in exchange for parole Yes maam would without a doubt Do we let anyone go Well looks ready to break Yeah but is that a reason to parole a man If we let somebody go theyre all gonna think they can just talk their way out of here Am right Jesse was just trying to do it exactly how was treated Completely reenact what they did their feelings their attitudes their indifference They What are Jesse wait Hey where you going You know what It was an experiment and went along with it but really hate myself right now You did nothing wrong That was just protocol Protocol Back in that room became everything ve hated for so long and let it happen And enjoyed it You cant possibly understand how it makes me feel Hey No need you to stay Parole for me please Sure Thank you Phil Oh no no Dont dont What is happening here Mike Is this thing over We have become part of this experiment whether we like it or not and frankly dont even think that we can call this an experiment anymore Its a demonstration and part of me thinks that we already have the results that we were looking for Mike No wanted to say that to you the last day or two but was afraid to question you You know suppose that if didnt admire you so much um dont know And now After seeing what this place has done to us to to to Jesse now realize that you have to see this through think uh This could be great Yeah had no idea it would turn out this way But This is important To me But the results are important They are Parole him Good evening gentlemen How about we make this one a night to remember You mean to tell me that you spent all day long in that stinking hole because you wouldnt eat two lousy little sausages God damn boy Well maybe you want us to take them sausages and cram em up your ass huh Bet you like that

terminated from this point on You The Stanford County Jail is now closed Youre all free to leave So does this mean were not getting paid for the full two weeks said to myself at the beginning of the first day This could be a very long very boring experiment Uh it wasnt conceivable There was just no strong sense of precedent for how far this thing could go Its easy for you to say Oh wouldnt have acted that way But you dont know Thats thats the truth You dont know And now know what m capable of and it hurts That dont know dont know how else to say it but it does hurt me to know that You know and knew right away it was wrong and was the only one that could see it You know anyone could see it except for these guys You know you give them the uniform with the glasses and the nightstick and they simply cant be the same person as if they wore street clothes Meanwhile m just a number in a dress Thats the thing wasnt a prisoner in an experiment was their prisoner really felt that was losing my identity that this person that call Tom was disappearing And it was a prison to me It still is a prison to me You know dont look at it as an experiment or a simulation at all It was a prison that was run by psychologists instead of by the state The consensus is that they did suffer But think that they also learned a great deal about themselves and about human nature And think most of them would say that in hindsight it was a very valuable experience This whole experience harms me and mean harms in the present tense It harms me How did it harm you Or how does it harm you Is it just to think that people can be like that Yeah And know youre a nice guy You know Well you dont know that No do do know that youre a nice guy Then why do you hate me Because know what you can turn into If you were in my position what would you have done dont know dont know cant tell you that wasnt Hmm dont think would have been as uh dont believe would have been as inventive as you dont think would have applied as much imagination to what was doing You understand Yes understand would have been a guard dont think it would have been such a masterpiece Personally dont see where it was really harmful It was degrading but that was part of my particular little experiment that Oh your particular little experiments Well why Yeah Yeah Why dont you tell us about those Yes was running experiments of my own Well tell me about these little experiments m curious Okay wanted to see just what kind of verbal abuse people can take before they start objecting before they start lashing back And it really surprised It really surprised me that nobody said anything to stop me Nobody said Come on man You You cant say those things to me Those things are sick Nobody said that And nobody questioned my authority at all And it really shocked me started to get started to abuse people so much started to get so profane And still people didnt say anything
