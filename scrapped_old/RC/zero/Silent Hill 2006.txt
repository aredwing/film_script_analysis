Get her up boys Get her up now There were good people in the town people like you Rose People who like to help Alessa was so lonely and hurt and scared They should have known better than to hurt her so badly When youre hurt and scared for so long your fear and pain turn to hate and the hate starts to change the world Alessas hate grew and grew burning inside her Her hate got so strong she even hurt someone who was only curious Thats when came told her it was their turn promised they would all fall into her darkest dream Now Rose we must talk Dont be afraid She wont hurt you She needs your help Who is she She is Alessa Then who are you have many names Right now m the dark part of Alessa Wheres my child Shes not your child Shes hers The little girl is whats left of her goodness We hid her in safety in the world outside this hell Now the dream of this life must end and so too must the dreamers within it For over years theyve lied to their own souls For years theyve denied their own fate But now is the end of days and am the reaper What do you want All we ask for is satisfaction Satisfaction Revenge Why me You chose You chose Sharon Christabella will find Sharon She plans to purify her Oh God no Their blind conviction repels me from their church cannot enter while they deny their fate but you can Just tell me what need to do Tell them the truth The child is mine Mine Shes
