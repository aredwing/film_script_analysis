hard getting up Didnt you have a good night No had a sprung mattress My back hurt it was damp on the ground spent the night as best could But the pure morning air makes it all worthwhile Here breathing is a real pleasure think theyve all left this place havent they Most of them were killed in the earthquake and the survivors moved away to live along the side of the highway in tiny houses They preferred the highway to the pure air here guess so They were right poor things After the quake help couldnt reach them The roads were blocked and many of them died The survivors left Besides you cant live on nothing but fresh air You need other things too and you find them along the highway And from there they can always move elsewhere Thats why Lets stop churning out cliches d like to tell you something about this place If you greet the souls of the inhabitants of this place they answer you Their souls Yes Hello If you say it that way only can answer Say it a lot louder so they can hear Hello Did you hear Youre having me on Why Its obvious its an echo If you think its an echo say something else Then youll see if they reply What can say Pouya Pouya Yes dad Nothing wasnt talking to you

of others but inhabitants of dead Poshteh are a lot friendlier than little Miss Tahereh What do you mean When you greeted them this morning at least they replied Thats true greeted her three times yesterday She never replied once Usually you only say hello once If theres no reply you never say hello again Its your fault Youre the one who asked me told you to say it just once thought that by
