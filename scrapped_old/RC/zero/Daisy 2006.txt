who built the bridge for me because after that somebody began sending me daisies Flowers am looking outside the window hoping to see the deliveryman But there is no one there So painted him as a

used you during an investigation and got you injured felt so guilty that didnt have the courage to see you But think its time for me to apologize to you formally am truly sorry She lost her voice and lost her ve found some clues about the guy who shot you But thought all we know is that he is Asian There were no fingerprints in the apartment The bullets subsonic with a silencer So thats why we didnt hear the sound of gunfire Thats right Hes a professional killer Hes probably behind the killings at the hotel and the theater over the last few weeks He probably belongs to a group of professional killers for hire ve asked some guys to look into how these killers are contracted And What do you mean and We can hire him Well wait for him and catch him Where do we get the money The boss wont approve it m not proud of this but won some money at the slots recently ll never get promoted if dont catch this guy Detective Jang Are you out of your mind So for this plan to work you need to hire the assassin What if he succeeds It might be okay if you put a contract on yourself You must be kidding have a family to look after Then you can hire him to kill me thatll solve everything What the Want some coffee Hye Young This is for me told a friend d come here Please get in Hes a cop Its not an easy assignment but the client specifically asked for you Were in a business where we must never say No to a client Dont worry will always be there to back you up heard youve been seeing someone lately You need money for the girl just like need you for the job Suspect approaching suspect approaching Its okay Hes a friend What Hello Hello What a place to meet you Yes May talk to you Sure hop in Why dont you have lunch ll be back right away Hey Where you going Jeong Woo just need a few minutes No its dangerous to stay there Hye Young told me a lot about you Really feel so bad about Hye Young can be quite careless sometimes didnt really mean it knew you were sincere The music is too loud Can we listen to something else Sure How did he know it was me from behind the car If youre the assassin what will happen to Hye Young You could have just shot me wonder how you recognized me Am not your target Do you think wont shoot you dont know if youll shoot me or not But know can Try it dont have to try Neither do Did you forget who you are Youre the good guy m the bad guy You are not here to kill me Why For Hye Young Not for yourself shouldve stayed out of her sight in the first place Youre the daisy guy She doesnt know it yet Do you know how long shes waited for you Only before you came along You should be going to the exhibition today How about you Unless you arrest me ll disappear Hye Young Whats going on Jeong Woo has been killed in the line of duty In Memory of Jeong Woo feel sorry about it but draw whenever think of Jeong Woo It makes me less lonely She sketches me probably only because she feels sorry But still there am within her reach This part

Can you really read my lips Is that what you said Hes not lonely at all He must be glad that you are here Its been a year but still dont know what has happened Before he was murdered he told me he met a friend and they left together My only clue was his car stereo it was playing classical music Jeong Woo never listened to that kind of stuff That means his friend changed it And hes missing Weve also learned that the killers received black tulips when they are contracted Do you like classical music Its been a year How have you been m fine Your position has been compromised That Interpol detective Jang is on to you Didnt tell you falling for a woman is like pointing a gun at yourself Forget about the mistake you made a year ago This is your last chance Your girlfriend suspects you This is a
