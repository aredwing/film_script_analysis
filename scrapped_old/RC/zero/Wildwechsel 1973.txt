at me Did he wait for you You just have to tell me Then ll slowly get up and go straight to the police Then hell serve out the rest of his time and perhaps a bit more But it wasnt like that We really did meet by chance You should have walked on without a glance back Well when you havent seen each other for months Youre shameless It was nothing He said Do see you again said Youve seen me now We didnt stop longer than a minute Then we said goodbye for ever Like ordinary people You arent ordinary didnt know that Now you know Anyway just because we met doesnt mean we are seeing each other Keep it that way If hear of such a thing again ll report him straight to the police and youll get to know me What did you cook for him What you said but he didnt eat much because he was angry Why Somebody told him d seen Franz Is it true You didnt tell me What was there to tell What did father say told him we met by chance He believed that Yes but if we meet again hell turn Franz in Have you been intimate What do you think love him m sorry we decided to have a child We could have had a nice life You should have thought of that earlier Hold your tongue Thats gratitude after all thats been done to you If father said hell turn him in hell do it Do you want Franz to suffer You know what he gets when you get caught years You wont see him before youre twenty It would be for the best anyway But dad believed me dont see what he has against Franz He ought to keep his hands off and not interfere with you He doesnt interfere love him At your age theres no love except for your parents But m still love him Wait for two or three years til school is finished Whats it to do with school Youre still a child Time passes quickly if youre patient Youd think differently if you had parents like mine When was young well about seventeen bought silk stockings with my own money Twentytwo Mark they cost wore them on a sunday and my father clothed me and ripped them to bits wouldnt have stood for that Things were different then he would have taught you What a business It wouldve been allright if no one had seen it But whats done is done So why worry Your parents worry But cant live without Franz wont give him up because of father d rather kill myself That would be the limit involving us in all that Well its true What have we done to deserve this Other peoples children are different For heavens sake dont get pregnant thats most important Were careful You wont tell father what ve said will you If you do wont trust you and wont tell you anything dont want to know another thing Hes not going to like it everything is beginning all over again want a simple family life like other people Father is neglecting things he shouldnt have to worry about you so much He should be putting his mind to other things Mama why are you crying Why shouldnt cry If they pick Bermeier up then well have peace Why did they release him before his time was up Every lout gets parole today Under Hitler he would have had a lesson in a concentration camp Why do you go on about the Nazis He was released for good conduct Because there are no women in prison They should be castrated cut it away And thats that But now we havent a regime we have a government They cant even protect children The Nazis had their faults too They gassed the Jews that was wrong but rather gassed Jews than pig mugging about with my daughter We neednt blame ourselves Johansser has three sons and a daughter how do they manage Compared with them Hanni lives like a princess Yet they are decent Dont get worked up its no use Our own flesh and blood ruining us Shes got no decent morals Well am expecting It may be late told you ve had a test am pregnant It costs ten Mark Well get an abortion By whom Well find a doctor just take a morning off school d have to take a note Its that or a child Have you got a thousand Mark Why thousand heard it costs a thousand Six hundred can raise that The trouble is youre so young look older You dont You look fourteen You said yourself that looked older doctor can tell how old you are Hell have you taken home by the police Shut up then if its impossible We neednt argue over it Something must happen before its noticeable When father sees hell kill us know We must think of something Undressing Why not it doesnt matter now We must make the most of our time will think of something Dont throw my coat on the floor That coat will have to be returned Its not yours gift is a gift Its Herr Bermeiers We dont need his presents Because you envy me That coat is whores pay Such language before the child dont want that coat here Keep it and its all you leave with You own nothing here Youre behaving badly Hanni She made her bed and she must lie in it pay for everything here But not the coat Thats mean Go to your room its time to go to sleep wont get rid of the coat Shes still a child Its not my idea of a child Thats your upbringing Why didnt you take it away from her What a bloody mess We need somewhere to live Come down to earth Forget it cant do a thing because of my parents and the child m edgy Its no wonder This is no way to live No because the child will arrive before long How long has it been Cant you count up to three It doesnt show Just be patient But it autumn youll be back in prison Shut up about that And you are stupid If would have a revolver or a rifle d go up to him and say Stop interfering with our love or else Would you say that He would agree then go straight around to the police Then youll see what they do when theyve got you trapped havent a gun anyway Thats no problem you can buy one You need a licence Not always You need to be twentyone You neednt Nonsense promise get you a gun You wont manage it Do you know what he is An unskilled worker His father cuts peat for a farmer at Dachau Just as thought He hasnt got a room of his own he sleeps in lodgings havent invested fourteen years of money in the kid for that If it was a decent young man from a family like ours d say Hanni is still a child but the future is to come We were young ourselves once but without money theres no love and without a trade there is no wive Especially when its my daughter We have bad luck First he does time Then when he comes out he acted though nothing had happened Thats fanaticism he must be doing it deliberately Or he is sick dont understand it couldnt do such a thing Thats the youth of today And what were we We had no youth They called us up in On my birthday we were in retreat Nothing to eat no proper clothes couple of lousy antitank weapons degrees of frost At night we hurdled up in winteraid blankets but shivered as though we were naked We werent youths we were soldiers Are you asleep Yes but m listening Better go to sleep Those times were different theres no comparison Still we are decent civilians Times have changed According to the papers they print all sorts of glums on All you need is money and havent got it If Hanni goes on like this the future looks black to me It would be no problem for a film star But an unskilled workman cant cope with it on his money Thats how it is always think times have changed when cant make things out But we wont live to see different times Neither will Hanni We must think things out Hanni wont grow up like other people In five years shell blame us for everything that she has no normal future At the moment shes not interested in a thing But thatll change Do you think shell stick to him It is not love its nothing but sexuality We have to bridle it and see its kept in proportion Where did you get it bought it You stole it Bought it said Give it to me What will you do with it Nothing Thats not why bought it What did you buy it for Nothing Give it when your father finds it hell hit you like over the coat Hell never find it hide it Whats it for To shoot a dog Why a dog No dog is hurting me What then Nobody What are you on about then What did say You talk nonsense give it to me Take it Look at it or are you afraid want you to screw me With my parents in the next room m longing for it You know what my mom said my father had said You should be castrated

frog Itll all be over in a month got red streaks on my feet Thats normal in pregnancy But its ugly You get a child as reward Are you glad about it If it wasnt for the kid wouldnt be in prison Its your own doing Maybe The stupid kid is the cause of everything The child is not to blame You must understand that What is it Nothing Why Because its dead It died two minutes after it was born Died It wasnt right it was deformed boy or a girl It would have been a boy Dreadful weather today is it You can say that It died Two minutes after it was born Did you see it Tell me glimpse after it died All deformed you couldnt make a head or tail of it The doctor said it was caused by the business about father In your belly Where else The accused are strictly forbidden to conversate Leave them be theyre just some poor devils m not stopping them but it is strictly forbidden If wed known before that it would die If the thing with father hadnt happened then it probably wouldnt have died the doctor said Now they are both dead Thats fate Stupid it is Now nothings left between us Its over It wasnt real love It was purely physical Thats what told the court agree it wasnt real love Come on in its about to start Did you had a name for the boy thought of Michael That would have been nice Cashier
