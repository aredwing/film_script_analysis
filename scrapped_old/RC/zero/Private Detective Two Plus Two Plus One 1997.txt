real gentleman He had no vices no shortcomings One flaw though He wasnt straightforward In other words he loved to lie Trivial lies reflexive unintentional Not for cheating anyone neither meant ill will nor goodwill He was weary of his own behavior The line between truth and lies ceased to exist Truth and falsehood are only a hairs breadth apart It was as if he had a transparent tongue Initially it was fun but eventually it became a habit mean the game went out of his hands It made him dance like a puppet Stop it Raj Then To cover up one lie he had to lie again and again Soon he lost count of the lies he told He couldnt remember them Gradually he failed to give continuity to his lies He just wouldnt remember where he left last time He was left helpless like a spider incurable It was a foolish disease yet dangerous and hopeless He was distraught yet incurable Poor guy Falsehood mirrored the truth What are you getting at My friend was inimitable a master in his art could do anything He could destroy even kill But he lost his stand He wandered ran hid few months after his wedding his wife deserted him Thats very bad He was aggrieved He loved her dearly He still loves her he said He said time will heal him but time wont snatch his memories away What about his wife She escaped However she realized her mistake As it happens in a story she pitied herself For all he said she read otherwise For all his dreams she realized something else She finally panicked found this lying down For my friends lies his wife screamed out the truth Now hurry up and tell what happened finally Raj you are dragging it too far And finally one day it all came to an end He killed himself When we broke the door and entered he was suffering fighting with death The gun was lying by his side He had lost a great deal of blood He was dying but he had not changed He had five different stories to describe his death First he said he shot himself then he invented a thief then a girl a friend vengeance

car She has taken it She has taken the car No need to worry Shell be all right wherever she is few days ago we saw her at a mountain There was this huge stoned structure lying in ruins There was no one around till far and wide There was a stillness in the skies There wasnt even a bird in sight All that cut through the mountains was the silence of the rocks It appeared as if she was undergoing a punishment Her face was a picture of sadness She looked worried terrified She moved forward to caress the rocky slopes It was as if a rhapsody had broken the stillness of silence And then appeared in the mountain a wedge and then it fell divided in two pieces Take me home want to go home And then saw the soil assuming the color of the rocks And like blood that has dried up there appeared a dark stain As if a flowing river had come to a halt Hurry up Quick Congratulations on your freedom Looks like your wifes departure has brought back your sleep If youre bored to sleep all alone after some days do let me know also run a modest marriage bureau Its meant for cripples but theres no harm in expansion Your partnership is good for my business What makes you run away with your tongue suddenly Did anyone see you coming You dont leave that to chance When got here your wife was all dressed and decked up Only thing is the redness of her dot had spread to her temple When looked in her eyes saw your picture in it got the feeling that she was about to break into a smile And then came Harish looking for your wife When the door wouldnt open he left in disgust You say amusing things Where did you leave her Shes happy without you wherever she is But we have a great partnership Isnt it Your cooperation has made my job easy But my fee is going to remain the same Let me have the money Where is

Inspector whatever happens this killer ought to be have the same objective as yours She wasnt murdered at home Her body was dumped in the car And the car was abandoned in a deserted place outside the city dont think theyll be able to catch up with him Who Whom The killer Its impossible She was in a hurry tearing hurry d say She made the booking over the phone and came personally the next day to collect the ticket Calcutta In a hurry she even forgot to cross the cheque Madam didnt come that day Or else shed surely have paid a visit to the factory When called her residence in the afternoon nobody answered it We were facing a financial crunch for quite a few days payments were getting delayed had some outstandings too But what can be done sir Such things happen in a factory No she was happygolucky Jovial Very clear about what she wanted An enemy She didnt wish anyone harm The last time When she came to the hospital With Raj Meghna had taken ill My wife Shes okay now Calcutta Its surprising that no one knows anything about it wasnt at work that day sir dont know what transpired Maybe the master arrived in a white jeep that day saw nothing else sir m sure didnt sir No sir no saw nothing more considered her to be my elder sister In fact she was even dearer There was something biting her for about a month Although she didnt tell me sensed it It could even have been her financial problems wish she had told me She wouldve been alive today for all you know What harm had the poor woman done to anyone What did anyone gain from her death And look at the police Theyre out to malign her name Theyre looking for evidence of her infidelity Harish you were very close to her Although shes no more you can tell me Could she ever have cheated on me Raj Amrita was in love with you Only you They make so many stories at a womans death Do you know why she was going to Calcutta No Now that shes dead think ve gotten closer to you can share my grief with you loved her very dearly

punishment is being held up because of me Dont be afraid Harish Raj Theyve taken Harish away In handcuffs Oh yes know whose doing this is There was this scoundrel who was harassing Amrita He was threatening her Blackmail He must be the one How long could she ask you for money How long would she keep paying him She must have turned him down What else could she do She used to be very scared of getting a bad name Hes the one who took her life He mustve killed her He has killed her And we must catch him Why Harish Harish hasnt done it No photos m from the press Which newspaper Midday They used to come in the afternoon The afternoon It was never in the night It was always in the afternoon want to adorn my hair with flowers ought to have known Amrita come come out Come Leave her alone

please carry a gift for me What The price to discover the secret All right And beware Come all alone knew it all along But what could do could only pray that everything would one day be all right That he would return to me But all that doesnt happen was dying slowly waiting for it to happen And when could take it no more took her life There was no other way With someone else couldnt even imagine d die without Harish Please have him released Its who committed the murder not him was mad out of jealousy You will have your Harish promise have nothing against him couldnt take it Harish is innocent m the one who committed the murder Have your juice What would Harish get out of killing Amrita anyway wanted Harish for myself couldnt share him with anyone It was my selfishness m the one who killed her not him When have said that he did So who did Who could it be Would you have a match No wanted just a matchstick Was it the man who threatened to tarnish her image Could it be the blackmailer who was tormenting her You just said you did it m mad Youre just the one had yet to meet That wish is fulfilled too Each one is worse than the other m sure the killer is the man who was blackmailing her This girl is talking any nonsense What a farce hes enacting Hats off to him Whatever happens ll find him Dont do anything without giving it proper thought Get a hold on yourself Meghna Everything will be all right Lets go ll drop you home Looks like your informant isnt showing up So tell me what am to do wonder how Harish is sleeping on the floor and what hes eating For all you know they might beat him up and get him to admit to the crime What will do then Lets get out of this place cant sit idly like this m sure he will phone again will meet him and save Harish Its dangerous for you to roam around freely What will you take to get lost Harishs release What else What reason for the sympathy cant bear to see the poor woman being widowed In any case dont quit halfway through So why dont you turn yourself over to the law Youve had a part to play in this episode too In fact your share is far bigger than mine cant betray you Have you gone mad Meghnas looking out for you deal with her could
