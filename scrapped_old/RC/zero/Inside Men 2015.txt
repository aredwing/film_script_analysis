Want to change the lead He does whatever he wants instead of following our direction Imagine what he would demand once he gets there But will Jang go quietly Nothing serious to have one more actor You want to proceed with two tops rather than one Hell realize when the film ends that he was only playing the supporting role Editor do you realize how much ve already invested in him And youre saying

that son of a bitch Lee Its your call What do you want How will people remember me How do you want to be remembered gangster who loved No stood by justice Dont smirk Damn should go to the beauty salon and get a new suit too nice one got this from Moon Ilseok former accountant at Mirae Motors It shows Mirae made a slush fund with billion from Hangyul Bank and gave million to Congressman Jang for his election campaign Today the prosecution raided Mirae Motors and Hangyul Bank According to a source Ahn who unveiled Mirae Motors slush fund was arrested and imprisoned in Seoul Detention Center Ahn is accused of abduction imprisonment and extortion Ahn claims he only followed the orders of Chairman Oh and Congressman Jang The prosecution will conduct a crossexamination Today at a press conference Congressman Jang said he will defy the prosecutions summons My conscience is clear before the people of this country have never received money or favors from Mirae Motors can stake my political life on it In the evening today Oh Chairman of Mirae Motors was suddenly hospitalized for a chronic disease Oh s attorney requested the prosecution to postpone the summons Its been reported that Mr Jo at Mirae Motors has left the country His actions has raised doubts that he left in order to escape However Mirae Motors announced that this was scheduled for months And that Mr Jo will voluntarily appear at the Prosecutions Office Lord shed me some insights Strong memories lack judgement Then shall we begin the show The water tastes okay Sorry so many cases to handle Hope you feel comfortable here My ass hurts after sitting for so long Thank you for the article Which article Prosecutions forced interrogation caused Seoks suicide think it was here Yes Whyd you kill him know you killed him by scratching a pen with your right hand didnt you Youre out of line Please ask questions based on facts only Enough fiction Only facts then No time anyway Are you happy to live kissing the asses of Jang and Oh Fuck who kisses whose ass Or not whatever saw you were quite active in the democratic movement before Even went to prison How come youre here now And you Why are you here Whyd you come here stringing along that idiot Ahn guess its the same reason Were both here because of what we desire But at least am not as dirty as you Whatever You introduced Ahn to Jang and Oh didnt you No didnt Why would a conglomerate head and a politician need to meet a thug Doesnt make sense No Then let me see Errand men were hired to suppress the strike of Mirae Motors in then for the campaign of New Party in s general election and for Mirae Motors purchase of a factory site in Now does it make sense People often use the phrase Its hard to see it as They write this often in interrogation dossiers and in newspaper articles But do you realize its nothing but wordplay Its hard to see it as preplanned Hard to see it as intentional Hard to see it as related And Hard to see it as a request But how would that be applied to a gangster like Ahn Its possible to see it as preplanned Its possible to see it as intentional Its possible to see it as related Its possible to see it as a request Or we might even say highly possible What the fuck are you trying to say m saying what is hard to see it as for one person can be highly possible to see it as for someone else Words are power What kind of crazy fuck would believe a thugs words Its already time for the morning paper Can read it Ahn Sanggoo who revealed Mirae Motors slush fund hired a hit man in to assassinate a member of a rival gang killer named Choi who was hired for the job is currently in Daejeon Prison This was revealed in testimony by a man named Park who used to be the manager of Ahns gang In addition the suicide of popular dance group member Min Jia in was allegedly sparked by repetitive sexual assaults by Ahn who was her agent at that time Members of the group are quoted as sources Fucking assholes told you the truth Nothing but the truth Its not the truth that matters Now no one believes what you say We need evidence or witnesses to make people to believe you Now tell me Did you or didnt you hire the killer did not You go to Daejeon and ask Choi And the sexual assault Min Jia had severe depression then Ask fellow group member Joo Eunhye Shell tell you the truth did everything you told me to You said you wanted to get Jang and did everything As disclosed at the prosecutors never introduced Ahn to Oh and Jang met Ahn several times when was doing research Are you saying Ahn lied Ahns past record of contract killing and sexual assaults on his talent is revealed m beyond appalled that the reputations of a respected businessman a politician and me as a journalist who has always fought for freedom and fairness of speech have been tarnished by the word of a thug Shes been dead for a couple days Seems she killed herself by carbon monoxide poisoning And went to see Choi he said he was hired by Ahn to kill Kim It is possible to see this as political manipulation by a certain group which incited Ahn to cause controversy just before the presidential election Let me modify one sentence Instead of possible write it as highly possible Moon exaccounting manager of Mirae Motors now living in Canada said in a recent press interview that hes never met Ahn and the slush fund that Ahn describes never existed in the first place If Moon is telling the truth it seems Ahns claims related to Mirae Motors slush fund have all been proven false Therefore its difficult to see how Oh and Jang might be related to the recent allegations Damn little punks Now all eyes have turned to who is behind Ahns false disclosure Joo Eunhye from the same dance group as the late Min Jia whose suicide was caused by Ahns sexual assault was found dead today Police see the cause of death as suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning and plan to investigate Ahns possible connection to the case Take care Mr Chairman Is there any way to save Ahn Why didnt you check his record That record was fabricated to get Ahn None of that is true The truth doesnt matter anymore m also losing ground within the party Accepting your proposal has completely ruined me Damn it need to look out for myself Politics is the survival of the country and the people And also my survival Sure Now understand what it means Then you should also look our for yourself Hello this is Woo This is Editor Lee Are you well Yeah just got a tipoff and am concerned if should write about it or not What is it now You know Jo president of Joyang Mirae Development
