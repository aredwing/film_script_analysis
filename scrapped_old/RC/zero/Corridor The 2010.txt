And did not recognize you have seen you in various states of madness How high your highest of heights How low are your lows How high your highest of heights How low are your lows am sorry had nothing left for you My mind was willing And my spirit was strong My lips were tired And tightened from singing along My eyelids are heavy as anchors thrown over How high your highest of heights How low are your lows How high your highest of heights How low are your lows have seen you in the eyes Of a hundred thousand other stranger faces have seen you in unlikely and unfamiliar places have seen you be reckless in matters of love have seen by degrees The boiling point come and go How high your highest of heights How low are your lows How high your highest of heights How low are your lows What lies at the end Of this long and dark twisted road How high your highest of heights How low are your lows have seen you in various stages of undress have seen you through various states of madness
