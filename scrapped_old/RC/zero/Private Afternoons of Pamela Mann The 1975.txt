For instance as soon as she wakes up she does her morning exercises She tells me its to start her heart Then the makeup Then theres breakfast And the day begins to take shape Do you think the welfare

Mr Mann free This is Ms Mann No m sorry Hes in conference Oh no Dont disturb him Tell him if he wants to reach me ll be at the Plaza at a political party Certainly Have a minute Sure Do you feel that the emergence of Bourgeois and often corrupt administrations in the recently liberated selfgoverning states of Africa can be explained by reexamining the circumstances of foreign domination which precipitated the process of colonial disentanglement certainly do Thank you Thank you Pamelas going to that fundraising cocktail party at the Plaza The contact and sublime joy in the arms and finger of a woman would indicate an insecurity with members of the opposite sex sense of inadequacy Has she seemed inadequate Oh You know this case is beginning to intrigue me Usually m quite detached But Pamela your wife is quite a challenge just cant quite isolate and put my finger on that common denominator Theres a fascination Well dont be discouraged Like said Pamela is going to this fundraising cocktail party My advice is to hide in an empty room Political speeches always bore Pamela Political speeches always bore Pamela She usually slips off somewhere Check political speech in background but first want to thank all of the committee members who worked so very hard to make today a success Particularly must single out Sally Rosencrantz and Charlene Guildenstern for the work theyve clone And of course Pamela Mann who perhaps put out more than anybody Now as most of you know we are all getting pretty tired of the deplorable state into which our social and moral structure has fallen Moral decay among the lower social classes is reaching new depths every year Weve all read the statistics Now something has to be done And it has to be done now And it has to be done by people like ourselves We must join in the action against the prurient permissiveness that has overcome society We must take action as a group and action as individuals We are very lucky to have with us today an individual who knows how to take action Action against degeneracy And action against depravity And thats why we are supporting him for political office We of the national society for the ecological preservation of natural stripmines have ourselves a winner How can you judge the qualifications of a political candidate Not by his good looks Richard Nixon proved that No we can judge the qualifications of a political candidate by what he himself believes in The goals he has set himself The way he tackles a job But most important how he is committed to ridding us of excessive nudity Free love Dope Pornography m coming Abortionists And vitaminaddicts This is our kind of candidate And should like at this time to call upon him to explain to you personally his feelings and the kind of corrective legislation he would propose if he is elected May introduce to oh Oh dear Now where did he go Oh Hello Hello Hello out there where m coming Well m sure hes in the room somewhere Oh there There he is As said it gives me great pleasure to introduce a moral beacon in our fog of immorality Arent people friendly when they dont know each other Youre right Listen since youve been following
