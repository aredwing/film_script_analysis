candle to the cellar for the professor and you fancy a bottle of his fine old brandy just throw the candle to one side Accidentally on purpose of course Anything can happen in the dark Presto Now ll just wipe this off and you can take it to Dr Parry Helen Come into the den want to talk to you Mrs Warrens asleep Professor Warrens with her now ve been thinking things over And Mrs Warrens right You should come with me tonight You can stay at my mothers place until we can make arrangements to go to Boston My mother will like you dont wanna frighten you but you heard Mrs Warren a while ago Her minds growing steadily worse and m afraid she may become violent She seems obsessed by the idea that you get out of this house And there may be something back of it Youll go with me tonight There are doctors in Boston wholl know all about your case want to take you there Helen When left you this afternoon dropped in at the Fabers They have a guest visiting them from your hometown Mrs Lindstrom You know her Well she told me a story about a girl girl who was on her way home from school one day She had good news for her parents When she wasnt far from her home she heard a fire engine rushing down the street She started to run and when she turned the corner she saw that it was her home that was in flames There was a crowd outside She wanted to scream herself but somehow she couldnt She tried to rush into the house but was held back because it was hopeless So without being able to do one thing to help she saw her mother and father burn to death m sorry Helen but had to do it Its only because wanted to help you Go over everything that happened that day Have the courage to see it all again And by not blocking it out of your mind you may find your voice again dont like being an outsider and you shouldnt either know what m talking about because m an outsider here myself lot of people dont want me They want me to quit But wont because theres at least one person who wants me here and thats good enough for me And theres one person who wants you to talk and that ought to be good enough for you Look at me Look at me Remember how wonderful it was when you had a voice When you could say hello or thank you When you could yell back at someone picking at you do it all the time You look at me as though you dont believe it but know m right Try to talk Try it Try it Excuse me My mother is asking for you Helen ll speak to Professor Warren about your leaving What is this about Helen leaving ll discuss it with your brother Is it something you cant discuss with me Why is she leaving Where is she going Well ve been doing a great deal of thinking about Helen know her condition is due to shock m sure a new mental therapy can restore her voice d like to take her to Boston Arent you taking a tremendous responsibility Building up her hopes Making her think theres some miracle in store for her Its up to her not you What youre doing is cruel and foolish That girl is adjusted to her affliction think you should let it go at that Suppose you let me mind my own business It so happens dont think much of your business Dr Parry If there is a solution to her problem it ought to be in the hands of someone other than a hick doctor The thing that keeps me from cracking you in the jaw is the almost certain possibility that it would break your neck Whats the trouble doctor The good country doctor having lost his wits was about to resort to his fists Professor Warren know youre interested in Helens welfare ve told you what ve learned ve decided its for her best interest that she leave here tonight Tonight She can stay at my mothers until we can take her to Boston for the examination first thing in the morning Doctor you know that agree with you about the element of hope that you have for Helen but whats your reason for suddenly making her leave tonight Well Mrs Warren feels that shes in danger here Surely you dont take the ramblings of a sick woman seriously take most things seriously But doctor there are many other considerations Helen needs this position Its her only means of support No family It wont be easy ve thought of all those things professor intend to take care of her Oh see Well m very glad for you and for her Youre a sentimentalist doctor Are your humanitarian instincts restricted only to people with serious afflictions Youre very insolent Dr Parry Excuse me Hello Yes he is Just a moment Its for you doctor Thank you Hello Helen the Wilson boy is sick have to go over there Now heres their phone number You can pack while m gone If you need anything before get back have Mrs Oates call me ll be back as soon as can Be sure and bar the door behind me And dont let anyone in but me Wilt thou obey him serve him Iove honor and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all others keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall live Signify by saying do Say do Say do Say do Say do Say do Say do Say do Say do Say do Whats the matter Helen Dont you feel well understand youre going to leave us Well dont know whether Dr Parry is right or wrong but agree that you should have that chance to go to Boston And want you to understand if things dont work out satisfactorily that youre always welcome to come here Now you run along like to see women cry Men like to see women cry It makes them feel superior Oh Steve m very unhappy and upset You dramatize everything Blanche Weve been very happy At least have dont like your attitude at all m sorry Its just m m making trouble between you and your stepbrother dont like to hide anything feel And you know how feel about you Thats very sweet of you Blanche But are you sure youre telling me the truth Truth about what Just that think youre uncomfortable because of your past

and if you were Oh its you You scared the life out of me told you not to touch me Get out ll get out Mrs Warren Not only out of here but out of this house Good riddance But before go youre going to hear a few things m tired of being a target for an evil old woman Nobodys asking you to stay If you got down on your knees wouldnt stay dont need this job Why dont you go You need a keeper not a nurse dont care if you never walk again You can stay in that bed for the rest of your life ve taken everything but ll not put up with this m leaving this house tonight ll soon clear them out hate nurses Always fussing Always washing your face Helen Did you know there was a girl murdered here a long time ago saw it Upstairs from the window It was getting dark thought it was a tree in the garden Stood so still and waited Then when the poor simpleminded creature came near the house the tree moved threw her into the well was too late couldnt find the rope You were that girl Helen Come here Come here You must go away Leave this house Go with Nurse Barker tonight Dont wait for Dr Parry Dont wait for anyone If you wont you must do what tell you You must get under the bed Do you understand You must hide under the bed Why wont you do what tell you to Why wont you listen to me Why wont anyone listen to me Would you mind letting me have a wagon ll leave it in the village for Oates to pick up Very well ll go out with you and hitch up the wagon Youre very kind professor ve been walking In this rain Yes In this rain wonder if youd mind doing something for me Stephen What Nurse Barker is leaving

before today watched you You had no mouth then Just as you have none now Look at yourself Look And theres no room in the whole world for imperfection The only person who could have prevented you from achieving the quiet that can give you was Stephen And you locked him up downstairs Were quiet now Helen m glad waited Everyones out of the way Mrs Oates is drunk because purposely let her steal a bottle of brandy And Oates hes gone to look for ether because made sure there was no ether And Blanche whom loved didnt love me so she had to die Shes dead and at peace And Stephen you took care of him for me Stephen is weak as once was What a pity my father didnt live to see me become strong To see me dispose of the weak and imperfects of the world whom he detested He would have admired me for what m going to do Who is it Its me the constable met Dr Parry in town He said he wont be able to pick Helen up tonight The boy is very sick and he has to stay there Oh m sorry to hear that ll tell her constable Well ll be on my way then Good night Helen Helen Helen Helen Helen Murderer Helen You killed them You killed them all The servant girl in the well The others in the town Today the
