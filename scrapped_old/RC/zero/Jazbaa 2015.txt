her so brutally Victim must have seen the killer And the killer couldnt tolerate that You meanthe killer and victim knew each other Bu spent all my life investigating crime scenes doctor The killer was either cynical or he was exacting some kind of revenge from the victim Normally such murders are either well planned or they are impulsive when things get out of hand This case is a mixture of both The wounds are unplanned and random But work after that is the job of a professional And before disposing the body he first cleaned it with alcohol so that theres no evidence left But the murder weapon sculpting knife was used as a saw Like a saw Imagine this is the sculpting knife and this is Siyas body Something like Enough doctor dont demonstrate it You were going to tell us something more Yes we found traces of a drug in Siyas mouth Phencyclidine Phencyclidine is Angel Dust It creates hallucinations Quite popular among the younger generation these days Known as the Angel drug Hello How

after getting rapedSiya tried to save herself She was alive until she got here After that her assailant came up behind her And killed her here The incident began in the bedroom but there were no signs of forced entry That meansSiya knew her murderer But what can be the connection between Siya and Niyaz mean Why would she let Niyaz in her bedroom Anu this is our job We will never frame an innocent man Especially in such cases Niyaz is guilty No one can be sure in such cases How can you be dont get this There are fingerprints scattered all over the place as well as his footprints Yeah The murderer was clever to clean Siyas body with alcohol so theres no for evidence Whether its a race or caseyou never give up You said something Nonothing Coffee How do you live in this mess dont only

murder To steal And slipped on Siyas blood which was already there He was scared He panicked Hence the footprints This means someone was there We must find out who that was Its surprising that you didnt find Siyas car We found her killer why would we need her car Find it as soon as possible Anu being a workaholic is one thing but what youre doing is an obsession Give me one solid reason why

said that its okay can stop this No its okay After Siyas demise felt a void around me And to fill that void kept everything in a way so to feel that Siyas still here saw thatmost of Siyas artwork were incomplete Why Siya was very impatient She would start her next sculpture or painting before finishing the previous one She would get bored easily Was she same with her relationships Maybe Like her papa Why did you two part ways Thats the irony His habits which attracted me towards him later became the reason of our separation His creativityhis attitude and hiscarelessness Any other reason Dhananjays affairs didnt tell Siya about her papas affairs Becauseit would shatter the image of an ideal man that existed in her heart So stayed quiet and Siya drifted away Do you think the court will change Niyazs death sentence to life imprisonment Orhell get bail Nothing is impossible for his lawyer am sorry ve to take this phone call Excuse me so sorry Ram Welcome sir Welcome Call your boss Sir

problem And the most decorated officer of the city is helping you in this Mr Yohaan if you werent suspended then you wouldve received another medal for this good deed You arrested Niyaz didnt you And now youre helping her to get him acquitted What about your honesty inspector Did you sell it Garima life doesnt give everyone the luxury of preserving their honesty Or the liberty to choose between right and wrong Life often brings you at crossroads where its difficult to choose whether to save our life or honor What difficulty has life thrown at you which compelled you to save that monster cannot answer this question now But willwhen the time is right Lets go Ms Verma am not fighting for my daughter alone But for all the daughters whose mother are still waiting for justice Come Did you

told you dont call me Mr Sunny Singh whats your line of profession Wellwere in the business of lock and key We make keysand open locks You must remember that two days ago asked you to pick the lock of apartment no Yes Could you No Why not told you then and therethats the latest lock from Germany And your honor even my father whos in this business for years cannot pick that lock You meanwhen you couldnt pick that lock then a clever thief wouldve failed too Right Right Dr Satish did you perform the autopsy on Siyas body Yes What did you find in the autopsy There were traces of a chemical in her blood Which chemical Its a kind of chemical which is called Phencyclidine Youngsters also call it Angel Dust Drugs to youngsters The one they use to get high Yes Your daughter Siya lived with you No she lived alone Strange you were a single mother Yet your daughter lived alone Not always Since she turned Why Did you two have an argument Or was your family breakup the reason Objection your honor What is advocate Verma trying to prove My motive was to draw the courts attention to the fact that when girls in a broken family feel lonely they tread down the wrong path in search of love and support Siya wasnt like that Then how was she Ms Garima My daughter was the most brilliant student of School of Arts But all the artwork in her studio are mostly incomplete Was there a void in her life too Theres a void in everyones life No one gets a complete world Advocate Verma Can you tell us how your daughter filled the void in her life Like most youngsters do these days With their friends Objection your honor This case is about Siyas murder not her personal life Your honor the conditions under which Siya was murdered her lifestyle had a big role to play in it Please continue Thank you your honor Did your daughter have friends Who doesnt She had dozens of friends Boyfriends Yes She had male friends as well How was Siyas relation with her boyfriend Objection your honor This is just an attempt to humiliate Siya disagree your honor To find the real murderer its important to find out who Siyas friends were what they did who did she go around with And how did she party if she did Will you hang up or not Joe Yes sir Its a kidnapping case Send backup Right sir Did Siya have relations with a lot of men ll repeat my question Did Siya have relations with a lot of men Mrs Garima hope you understand what m trying to get at clearly understand what youre trying to say You want to prove that my daughter was shameless On what basis Because she had a few male friends Advocate Verma my daughter was clever beautiful emotional Men would hover around her so what Is that a crime Are you one of thosewho always think that its always the women whore at fault People who blame the girl and not the rapist after shes been raped They blame her sense of dressing They blame her independent thinking They blame the very fact that shes a girl Ms Garima am sorry to hurt your feelings No Advocate Verma Youre not sorry At this time you are just a lawyer who wants to win her case at any cost If you had any humanity or sympathy then you wouldve understood my pain dream about my daughter every night where she says Mama save me want to live Help me Mama Back when she was a kid even a small hiccup would give me sleepless nights Imagine my condition when her scream resonates in my ears every night Your honor seriously object to these kind of questioning My questions are relevant your honor Did you know that your daughter took drugs Yes Your honor please note Siya was a young girl She lived alone She had lot of male friends and she also took drugs And that night the lock of Siyas apartment was impossible to pick from outside So obviouslySiya opened it herself from the inside And Siyas killer who came into her apartment that night must have been one of Siyas male friends whom Siya must have invited over herself And not some petty thief who went there to steal some money for his mothers medicine That will be all your honor Recess The trial will continue after an hour Ms Verma what Niyaz did with my daughter behind closed doors you just did that to her character in the open Whats the difference between you and Niyaz Nothing Maam ll find out Madamyoure very good And that Garimashes such a good actor What a performance she gave in the court You have no idea what a mother has to go through Your case is being defendedby a mother Not a lawyer understand Your name Nazia Nazia Qureshi Youre Niyazs wife Legally married Yes Thank you ll come straight to the point Did Niyaz know Siya Yes Please tell us more clearlyhow How did Niyaz know Siya He supplied drugs to Siya What kind of drugs Every kind of drugs Ecstasy Marijuana What did he say that night before he left Like where hes going Did he say anything He saidhes going to Siyas house for recovery To get the money Your honor the witness statement clearly indicates that the accused knew Siya meanNiyaz knew Siya before she was murdered Thats all your honor Wait Hold on Why didnt you tell me that you knew Siya Was it important decide whats important and whats not Understand told you to tell me everything Didnt LookSiya promised that she will return my money went there to get the money but when got there she was already dead swear Was she really dead got in the mood wanted to her right there but then she started fighting back And then raped her had to kill her Because knew Siya wouldnt keep quiet Thats all Happy Seven million Yes After the old woman dies Niyaz will get seven million of the policy How can a drugsupplier get a seven million policy for his mother Its a really old insurance bought in Bought by some Sheikh Abdul Rehman of Dubai Oh so this insurance is a gift from his mothers old love And what if Niyaz is dead The money goes to the wifeNazia Nazia Yes Ohthats a new twist in the story Advocate Verma fights to win and winning has become her habit She can do anything she wants sir But Niyaz will be sentenced to death And anyway dont like losing after getting this far True Heres the file sirthe one you asked for yesterday Exactly the way you wanted Abbasis a midlevel goon Neither

understand He came home in the morning high In his girlfriend Siyas carwith her body Are you crazy What have you done What have you done Its really unfortunate and sad that the murderer is someone else mean Niyaz Right nowSam seems more like the murderer This is the reason came here at this late hour Drugs has put my son in a really bad condition and the morning that Siya died my son believed that had murdered Siya Thats why that fool even went to Siyas funeral And when found out put him in rehab with backdate papers What are you doing Stop it Please dont do this What are you doing Maybe

the girl Wheres the girl You will never find the girl Never Anuradha Verma is alive apologize guess my boys are out of shape Its alright Some get better with age while some get worse This is my son Sam want you to keep him safe for some time There can be no room for any more mistakes this time Dont worry your son is now my secret ll be free Where do we meet Done Done Done m going to be a free bird The footprints and fingerprints from Siyas studio and the fingerprints from her wallet These are all firm evidence that leave no room for any doubt that Niyaz murdered Siya And his old records which include rape and exploitation of women for his own lust these records are enough to prove his motive Thats all your honor Your honor as the prosecution admits Siyas murderer could be this Niyaz Silence Defense please continue Like said even according to my investigation Niyaz can be Siyas killer For the courts information Niyaz used to supply drugs to Siya But those drugs were for Siyas boyfriend Sam And that night Niyaz went to meet Sam You Sam asked for some stuff want money Wait Which means another person was present there during the murder What are you doing here Here you go Thank you Leave Its new stuff want to taste it No thank you Leave Its good Sam Sam Sam Wake up Sam Sam please wake up Defense council is only making assumptions your honor Theres no evidence suggesting that Sam was present on the night of the murder Absolutely right your honor There is no evidence And its also true that whatever just said are just assumptions And have no firm evidence But does the prosecution have any firm evidence against my client meanthe murder weapon That so called sculpting knifewhich has my clients fingerprints where is it Its the prosecutions responsibility to prove my client guilty The prosecution has already admitted Niyazs fingerprints and footprints found at the spot of the crime Footprints and fingerprints cannot be accepted as firm evidence your honor As long as the prosecution doesnt present the murder weapon with the defendants fingerprints on it Until then the defendant cannot be proven guilty And Sam was present there too that night Anyone can be the murderer Just because Niyaz is a drugdealer its convenient for the law to suspect him But Samis the son of a rich father who has connections well into the system Thats whythe police didnt feel the need to investigate him Even if we believe for a while that Sam murdered Siya then the question arises that why Sam killed his girlfriend whom he loved so dearly What was the motive Watching Siya and Niyaz in a compromising position Sam got out of control And maybehe killed Siya in a fit of rage Maybe he was already highbeing a drug addict At least Niyazs fingerprints were found at the murder spot Does the defense council have any evidence suggesting that Sam was present there that night Oneevidence advocate Verma Weve evidence your honor apologize but would like to request the court to hear him out for delivering justice Please Your honor please The night Siya was murdered were you there Were you there Yes Did you kill Siya Nowhen got up she was dead Someone killed her and left her there So what did you do took her body home And then your father Mahesh Maklai cleaned the body with alcohol and threw it in the ocean to get rid of it Answer me Sam Yes Thats it your honor This means the murderer can be Niyaz or Sam But the real murderer can be identified only when the murder weapon is found which has the murderers fingerprints But Sam and his millionaire father Mahesh Maklai are guilty of all the crimes committed after the murder Moving the body from the murder spot Cleaning it with alcohol and then throwing it in the sea to get rid of it This clearly proves Sam and Mahesh Maklais crimes request the court to reopen the case And to release my client Niyaz on bail until the real murderer is not found Niyaz has paid a big compensation for his poverty and past crimes dont say that he should be acquitted but bail is his legal right and he should get it Thank you your honor Court orders Mahesh Maklai and Sam Maklai to be taken into police custody Defendant Niyaz is granted bail Mrs Verma told you Abbas might have many traits but he always repays his debts Goodbye Sorry Maklai sir Some people dont change with time they get worse Niyaz where are you am out of jail
