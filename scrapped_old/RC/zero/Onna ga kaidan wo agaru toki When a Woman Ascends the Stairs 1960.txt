hard time when you get married had it hard at first At first Oh when you got married ve always wanted to ask What was your husband like Handsome Theres a photograph in the family shrine May Isnt he goodIooking Hes kind of chubby m disappointed He wasnt really handsome but he was so kind Maybe because he was ten years older was just out of high school caused him such grief with my selfishness He died so soon wish d been nicer But he looked so healthy Was it illness No he got hit by a truck Poor man Its hard to forget someone you lose so unexpectedly Mama is it true you put a love letter in his urn Who told you that Mr Komatsu said you told him once when you were drunk Its a beautiful romantic thing to do When heard that respected you so much Silly girl Its not true Thats Komatsu for you It was in a novel read novel What a letdown But my husband was such a good person Is that why nobody else can win your heart Its not that It just seems so dirty Its not my way If a woman does such things her charm disappears Arent you Ionely sometimes Sure But have a brandy and go to sleep That kind of fever soon passes You really have some selfcontrol clench my teeth so hard they hurt Honest Youre so gullible Oh you woman shouldnt be loose Thats one rule ve followed m not a prude but if let go once itd be too hard to stop Maybe m just a coward Dont sit there thinking Your foods getting

the money but wouldnt hand it over ll go see him tomorrow The usual inn at Tsukiji Wont he try to seduce you They try all the time but it can only work if let them Famous last words Youve heard of Nobuko at Club She wouldnt even give in to a cabinet member But then she fell in love with some downandout guitarist Now shes a maid in a love hotel started as a busboy in the Ginza ten years ago ve seen a lot like her Whats your point Just sharing my experience Good marmalade Thanks for coming Yesterday had to take five kimonos over to Yuris place Five Her business must be booming Care to buy any yourself just finished paying for my last one Pay whenever you can trust you Men are so strange You always rush off afterwards Its bad manners especially the first time Cant you stay another hour Dont get lipstick on me Youre like a politician You dont keep your word The girls in my care are precious goods not to be touched That only applies to women like Mama Oh thats nice Fooling around with me while going on about her There arent many like her in the Ginza Oh see What You did to me what you couldnt do to her Nonsense Hurry and get ready Hand it over What The money You said you liked me m a pro charge the men like too It pays better than a normal job but have to spend so much on myself Its a vicious circle It makes no sense The owner takes it all anyway How old are you Dont ask Old enough Thirty Thats the turning point in a womans life The time to decide whether to marry or open your own bar Tell me would you like your own place Youre joking ll consider it if thats what you want couldnt Yes you could You could make it work How much would it take Give me a figure Even tiny bars in the Ginza cost over a million Then its no problem Some money lent out came back before it was due An honest fellow See In cash Just a little windfall My wife will grab it if take it home And the banks only pay If youre serious about setting up shop take it Youd lend it to me Well maybe even give it to you come to Tokyo several times a month Its a waste staying all alone in a big room like this Maybe we could reach an understanding dont want to force you into anything Think it over Ask yourself if you want to spend your life working for others Mama come closer Will you dine now No thank you m just leaving should be going ll have an answer next time see you Hello Komatsu d like your advice Its not a bad proposition You approve Thats irrelevant So youll finally get a place of your own You were a cashier when recruited you five years ago Time flies Now its either marriage or my own bar No respectable man would marry me now ve made up my mind So youre giving in to the old man after holding out for five years Whats so funny If was going to do it that way there are better men than Mr Goda ll solicit subscriptions If ten men put up yen each that would make a million ll deduct their drinks from what owe them Now approve Being a kept woman is stupid ll chip in too You will Thanks But dont want to burden you Mr Sonoda Mr Ito and Mr Matsubara theyre good for yen each Thats The rest are small spenders But Fujisakis a banker He could put up No not him Why not No special reason You feel awkward asking him Something like that know a good bar for sale Where Shall show you Please The down payment is cheap Just one drawback You share the restroom with the sushi place downstairs No pressure but ve got two other interested parties Well talk it over ll be eating downstairs Well It needs some fixing up but its a good place to start ll be your bartender Youre too expensive Not at first But sharing the restroom with a cheap sushi place would my customers come Theyll come to see you Lets do a test run Order something dry martini Coming right up Komatsu your secrets out The lipstick on your shirt Lipstick Cant avoid an occasional smudge with so many women around So what do you say Well We cant quite decide ve got nicer places What a surprise Long time no see d like to talk to you How about some tea Are you still angry at me Angry at you About what want to apologize for taking your customers m sorry It was the only way to keep my place going Dont worry about it Minobe still comes Yes Maybe its this light but you look thinner Just between us m deep in debt Its taking its toll You must be joking heard you bought five kimonos for Christmas dont have them anymore bought them on credit then pawned them for cash Clever huh Isnt that risky sold my car and put away my golf clubs borrowed so much to get started that now m in a pinch Dont laugh Whatll you do ve decided to die Isnt that a great idea They say sleeping pills work quite well Yuri Just kidding Itll be a staged suicide wont actually die ll just fake it to hold off creditors Shocked Not shocked Impressed thought with your place doing so well your view of the world might be a little too rosy But youve tasted struggle too respect that Youre embarrassing me What a strange conversation Whatever happens dont give up By the way m going to open my own bar Really Thats wonderful Lets drink to that Women working in the Ginza fought desperately for survival It was a battle couldnt afford to lose On my days off took my pledge book from one company to the next Some men promised more than expected some less But didnt want to discuss money with the man really cared about pledge book Well well Your money will be repaid little by little in the form of your bar tab So we have to come drink to get repaid Smart idea m not trying to coerce anyone Joking aside d like to help especially since its you but a bank cant lend without collateral However can put up may be branch manager but its other peoples money May speak to you sir Excuse me shouldnt have come Collecting on bills Depressed dont feel down My client didnt pay but at least ran into you How about some tea What a nice fragrance Whats your perfume Black Narcissus Must cost a lot Its stronger here than at the bar Really So youre opening your own place Has everyone contributed Nothing but promises so far m counting on you too Youre putting me in a spot Why Well No d better not Come on Tell me All right bar is no place for you d be happier seeing you marry a good man Youre the first to say that Everyone else encouraged me Its not the money But always feel sorry seeing you with drunks dont know how you got into this line of work but you belong in a nice home Dont be offended Its just my opinion Put me down for yen Christmas time again How depressing have to buy new clothes sell tickets Well well Long time no see Kiyomi How are you m fine but the Lilac is going under Did you hear Yuri did a terrible thing know You do She committed suicide No she was just faking Can she fake being dead Dead Yes just got back from paying my respects She put sleeping pills in brandy Not too many but with that much alcohol m sorry she was so much trouble to you Not at all just came to offer my condolences only sold her a slip and some panties You can pay me in due course ll discuss it with my relatives If m not paid soon ll be fired Well do what we can Please m very sorry should have stopped her No it was just her bad luck One way or another it would have come to this Forgive me for saying so but told her from the start not to work as a hostess Besides she was too young to own her own place Even a man who works his whole life cant be sure of success How much harder for a woman on her own Stretch yourself too far and youre bound to fail Excuse me ve come on behalf of Mr Minobe m Yuris mother apologize for all the trouble she caused you m deeply sorry for your loss Its very difficult to have to say this but selling the bar only covers part of the million that Yuri owed Mr Minobe He requests that you pay the remaining yen have the papers with me We need your seal Must do it today Her funerals not even over yet m merely Mr Minobes employee Why do you think she died You kept pressing her for money She thought a suicide attempt could hold you off But instead she really died What do you need Never mind that Can you get it Ask the owner can make a lot on the deal Its a managers duty to help If you get the money we can go to the hot springs together Forget it Youre in love with Mama arent you dont normally tell strangers fortunes but since you know the lingerie shop owner see the word sake in the back of your mind Is there some connection with your work Yes work in a bar That explains it What do you want to know Its about starting a bar of my own Pick a card Not for a couple of years Youd be rowing a boat against the current Time solves everything Wait patiently Youll soon receive a marriage proposal proposal came to work and forgot about everything Welcome Dont you have the wrong place Youre terrible hiding out here and not even calling me This is Mr Horiuchi Hes with Asahi Steel Pleased to meet you My pleasure Even more beautiful than was told Hes a big shot in steel thought you two should meet m indebted to him see Youd better be careful Hes no good Dont go telling him the truth Poor Yuri Yes She should have told me about her debts It was only a million or so could have helped You sold her place Squeezing her mother for That should be your condolence gift Whats your problem Tomoko get me a drink Straight Dont worry ll pay for it You really cant hold your liquor Mama the manager wants to see you What Dont be so nasty to Mr Minobe You want me to flatter him Forget it Customers pay for a good said forget it quit the Lilac because of him Who is he anyway He drives Yuri to desperation then comes here like nothings happened hate him He makes me sick Not tonight can still smell the incense from Yuris funeral Just being next to him is an insult to her memory There are limits even in business Stop being so emotional This is a bar People pay to have a good time So what Listen to me You get paid to show men a good time If you dont like it take off that kimono and work in an office and starve Shut up Komatsu Mamas throwing up blood Blood Mama are you all right Call a doctor Get a cab Sorry to bother you It was a small ulcer Four weeks passed spent both

perfumes it all serves that purpose Men wouldnt be interested if they knew lived in a place like this Somehow it would show no matter what did Isnt it a shame youre stuck with us Why even come home Go to some expensive hospital Mother Isnt it the truth That would suit your silk kimono better Mother how many times must tell you Kimonos arent a luxury for me know its business Thats right Looking good means good customers In the Ginza appearance is everything You wouldnt understand m actually quite frugal Flashy kimonos would get more attention but cant wear them in the daytime so buy plain ones
