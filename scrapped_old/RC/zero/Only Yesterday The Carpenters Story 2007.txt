Karen and Richard Carpenter looked like wellscrubbed youngsters from middle America whove come up with a sound the public likes lightning striking a fortunate pair Dont you remember you told me you loved me baby There was something magical about the way Richard and Karen worked together Thats the beginning Sharing horizons that are new to us Karen Carpenter could sing the phonebook and it would sound good Her voice was like a piece of silk Patsy Cline was the closest to me Both of them shared the same emotion And it was struggle and depression m on the top of the world When she was forced out from behind the drums to the front she didnt enjoy it at all can find think that Richard and Karen both could have extremely viable careers today had some different decisions been reached then Every All of our success came from the records You dont forget the records and go touring around the world She was the most truthful person think ve ever met But she lied like a trooper about the anorexia situation Only yesterday Every now and then we throw that word around it That person has it Well she had the it whatever the it is She had it And its the way Only yesterday The story began in New Haven Connecticut with Richard and Karen being born into a typical suburban middleclass family was born with an interest in music By the time was twoandahalf or three was interested in the records that my dad was playing He had quite an extensive and eclectic collection of s which wanted to get at Heres what a world Is waiting for this summer Les Paul and Mary Ford probably had the biggest impact on me well with anybody because of the overdubbed sound With these four switches can take Marys voice and multiply it And with this switch right here can take the one guitar and multiply it into an orchestra Right there by the time was four years old left such an impression on me And couldnt figure knew it was Mary Ford Marys voice All alone Two voices Of you m dreaming So asked my mother How do you do that Whats my mother going to say Nobody knew except at that time Les and Mary and a couple of people in the business So it was like how do you get to Carnegie Hall Practice My mother said She practises All night long So m going around the house at four or five years old going Mmmmmm trying to get all these voices to come out And later learned All night long Karen when think back on it would be downstairs and shed sing it And boy did we take to it Karen and The whole multitrack thing And all the stars there never were Are parking cars and pumping gas My mom wanted me to have piano lessons and just didnt like it So after a year it was mutually agreed between my folks and the teacher He really doesnt seem to have much talent or interest in But several years later all of a sudden m picking things up by ear and found could do this kind of stuff all on my own and play by ear And so by now my parents said We need to find him another teacher think Agnes was a great mom think she knew what she wanted for her children think she had insight for Richard And think she loved her children dearly During the summer the windows are open everybodys outside playing in the street and Richard would be playing his musical scales up and down the piano At that time really didnt have any ideas of where was going But he had always wanted to be exactly where he is He had ideas but didnt know could do anything think Richards parents Agnes and Harold were beginning to feel that Richard really had talent and theres two places you should go if you have musical talent either New York or California If everybody had an ocean across the So in the Carpenter family took off in search of the American dream California to a land that was fast becoming a place of free spirits open hearts and a vibrant music scene Their parents brought them to California years ago to have them near the centre of show business There they saw it in him like youd imagine but Cos didnt do anything Till she got to California two years after we got there The story is that they moved here to further my career but the number one reason was my Dad wanted to get the hell out of the cold And was right with him Everybodys gone surfin We never regretted making this move but Karen wasnt so happy She had a bunch of friends back there It turned out there was a heatwave the first Christmas so she didnt like that But she got over it Richard soon established himself as a local talent and joined the college choir playing piano It was in my first year of college that d gotten to know a fella named Wes Jacobs who turns out to be a tuba major but found out he could play upright bass was just taken immediately by his talent And we got together shortly after that me with my bass and Richard on the piano And we experimented to see what we could do together Karen was fascinated with the drumming cos said You can get out of physed if youre in the marching band Karen did not want to be in physed And wanted also to get out of geometry cos just dont get it And when got into marching band immediately fell in love with the drums Richard mentioned that his sister who was still in high school at the time was learning to play the drums and perhaps we could form a trio The Carpenter Trio The Richard Carpenter Trio went on to win the prestigious Battle Of The Bands Contest at the Hollywood Bowl And an talent scout intrigued by their rocktuba sound offered them a record deal was a budding man myself and knew damn well rock tuba was going nowhere And we cut the four sides and a committee you know a committee listened to them and of course said Erhhh And that was it for our deal with Well be in Denver Dancin in the street Every now and again d ask Karen to sing And shed do it almost under duress Oh it doesnt matter what you wear Just as long as you are there Karen was a little hesitant actually about singing and think for some period of time she really wanted to play the drums The breakthrough in a way this is the key wrote it in was one called Youll Love Me The melody was They say were too young to ever know a love It happens to be right And out came that sound And ll know youll stayayay And know youll love me And heard it Oh Theres something here There is something here Karen started singing by then And we added some people we had met at college and started this group called Spectrum Spectrums lineup included Richards college friend John Bettis And a creative partnership soon developed Richard was so noticeable because of his talent for one thing He was an amazing pianist then as he is now So everybody knew who Richard was Yesterday thought youd stay Karen was having a whale of a good time It was really playtime in a way lot of hard work but we were all together there was a lot of laughs a lot of fun a lot of music Renowned West Coast musician Joe Osborne had long supported Richard and Karen letting them record in his garage studio and helping them refine their sound He was also a very important studio bass player and also close friends with The Mamas Papas All the leaves are brown All the leaves are brown And the sky is grey And so he for some reason had access to The Mamas Papas equipment And we got a possibility to do an audition for a private club in Los Angeles called The Factory And so we were very excited and we didnt really have proper equipment So Joe allowed us to borrow The Mamas Papas equipment It had whitestencilled on it Mamas Papas Mamas Papas Mamas Papas So we were on stage doing our best to stand in front of it And who walked in but Cass Elliot We were so busted California dreamin By mid a string of rejections had taken their toll on Spectrum And tensions started to build mean the guys quit because we couldnt get a recording contract We went around for about a year trying to get someplace And zero so everybody went their own way So Richard formed The Carpenters with sister Karen Dont be afraid to love and get loved In mid we made this demo It ended up on Herb Alperts desk And he heard the potential and that was it We signed with in April It knows how to make you sing Usually just close my eyes when listening to a new tape and did on this occasion and all of a sudden this amazing voice came out of my speakers And it seemed like it was sitting next to me on the couch It was a real special Godgiven you know instrument that had never heard quite like that before You need cooling baby m not fooling You have to understand that at that time the world was turning into serious rocknroll And here were these amazing kids doing this incredible pop material Some say think you kids are out of sync with your time with the soft sound Oh sure the rock noises were at their highest Yeah yeah We were in the era of Stones Zeppelin Pink Floyd whatever That was the problem We had a whole bunch of people who were hairy rock fans And if their mum liked The Carpenters then you werent going to like them Most of the people at didnt want us there And they were trying to talk Herb into cutting his losses and just letting them go But always felt that they had that special ingredient because they were so unique in what they were doing They were so honest about what they were doing thought it was just a matter of time before before the audience would catch up to them was and Karen was And we were given carte blanche think m gonna be sad think its today The first album yielded the ballad version of Ticket To Ride which is mighty good and got on the charts at least was going through a rough period in probably the worst year in their history Hes got a ticket to ride It sold substantially enough and got enough airplay that it definitely deserved another shot Hes got a ticket to ride And he dont care What they obviously needed was a great song and an arrangement a production that would really present them in a great way The search was on for the next song and Herb Alpert turned to song writer Burt Bacharach for that crucial charttopping hit Herbie said have a record but dont want you to hear it dont want anything to influence your arrangement except after the first bridge there are two quintuplets piano One octave and then down an octave So in our key which turned out to be it would be Why do birds suddenly appear Every time you are near Just like me they long to be Close to you This thing took shape And we started adding things to it People were doing what they werent supposed to do studio protocol and etiquette and all of that you were not supposed to push open a door and walk in the recording studio But people were theyd push open the door and say What is this ve never heard anything like this This is sensational On the day that you were born The angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moondust in your hair Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue When its done Herb plays it down the phone to Burt andwell smash all around Just like me They long to be close to you It came in at Then it stayed there for a month It was just one of those things you hear and you say What did do to deserve this Wahahhaah Close to you When the wah came on they went that works Wahahhaah was driving along on a street in Connecticut had the radio on and heard them singing Close To You their first big hit almost hit the telephone pole Wow thats Karen and Richard Oh its beautiful The nominees are Simon and Garfunkel for Bridge Over Troubled Water Carpenters for Close To You The Beatles for Let It Be Its all of your dreams coming true You cant put it into words Its so exciting Its Close To You ErWe still cant believe we even had a record out You go from having time on your hands to not having enough time in the day Wait wait wait Thats enough These days with The Carpenters nobody can afford the overtime Looking for a followup to Close To You Richard knew of an writing team Roger Nichols and Paul Williams whom he particularly admired Paul would drop by and sing with us when we were rehearsing in the sound stage so was well aware of his voice Weve only just begun To live This really good commercial comes on knew it was Paul immediately which means its a NicholsWilliams song And m thinking This sounds like a hit record to me bank commercial fell out of television set Weve only just begun Richard just heard it and he was on the phone probably before the programme went back on saying Is that a whole song Please tell me thats a whole song So saw Paul and said This song Weve Only Just Begun does it have a bridge in the third verse Yes it does We start our walking and learn to run mean Oh cant wait to get this out This is a hit Weve only just begun To live White lace and promises kiss for luck and were on our way Weve only begun Before the rising sun we fly That was the skydiving moment for Richard That was like when he got When he caught that it was like Great Because that was a gift from the gods to have Weve Only Just Begun laying there And yes weve just begun Well as soon as Close To You was on its way down Begun And that became the wedding song for a generation As the records continued to sell struggled with marketing the wholesome brotherandsister duo Richard always said he liked the phrase Goodyfourshoes Not goodytwoshoes even though it was indeed making fun of how squeaky clean their image was They did wear sweaters they did have schoolboy haircuts they did sing nice songs And she did do needlepoint you know It aint very rocknroll And records not to their credit played that up even more with the artwork and the album covers They just didnt know how to package us really put up a fuss over the Close To You one because it was a rushjob And management said nothing about it and to this day that thing is still in print thankfully because its a good album but it is one crappy cover Their image on the album covers was not the only problem They realised Karens own presentation needed some work Love look at the two of us Strangers in many ways Richard and tried desperately to get her away from the drums And thats something early on we had to work on because she wanted to drum and sing People did not want to see her behind the drums She was only she had this huge drum kit and it was tough to see her Aaaaahhhhhh She was very very happy being Richards sister and not being the star of the group She had no desire to stand up and be out in front Very shy and she found her ground literally behind that drum set And when they finally said Youre gonna go out front and hold that microphone think she was terrified the first few times knew you well For only time So made a deal with her For the ballads she would stand up And love may grow for all we know You sat at the drums all the time now youre standing more Do you miss sitting back Yeah they finally got the message across to me that they wanted me to get up was the only girl in the group so they were looking at me ve never felt it was a coincidence that Karen played the drums So when she was forced out from behind the drums to the front she didnt enjoy it at all But it was a must She couldnt she to be out front thats where people wanted to see her This was the voice Talking to myself and feeling old Sometimes d like to quit Theres so many singers that you turn to one another and say Was that so and so Karen Carpenter sang two notes and you knew exactly who it was Rainy days and Mondays always get me down Shed be rehearsing a song in the car and you could barely hear her voice What ve got they used to call the blues But then youd do into the studio and youd hear her sing it on a microphone and the microphone loved Karen Carpenters voice It was like velvet It was like something ve never ever heard before Rainy days and Mondays always get me down She had an incredible tone in her voice it was rich and full and it was barely a whisper but it sounded really strong Long ago And oh so far away You cannot touch that emotion today Theres no way Theres nobody Theres nobody out there thats touching that Patsy Cline was the closest To me both of them shared the same emotion And it was struggle and depression Your guitar You saw this fabulous girl out front singing the songs with such emotion but again through her vulnerability she really felt those lyrics And so to watch The Carpenters thats what you were getting the most incredible interpretation of wonderful songs Dont you remember you told me you loved me baby You said youd be coming back this way again baby Baby baby baby baby Oh baby love you really do cant sit here after all these years and tell you she actually lost herself in it Karen could walk in and sing a lot of these things just in one take feel that there was something bigger going on that we probably will never know what was going on because that voice had too much soul too much heartbreak too much pain in it to be just an insecurity Loneliness Is such a sad affair Karen and were at a restaurant in Los Angeles and Karen and were walking out having had dinner and John Lennon was walking in and as he drew up to us he stopped and just looked at her and said wanna tell you love youve got a fabulous voice and just walked on She was absolutely incredulous about it She couldnt believe it He couldnt have meant it Did he mean it said Well of course he meant it This was Lennon Why on Earth would he stop to tell you youve got a great voice if he didnt think so But she had a problem believing it she really did We would ask her to come and sing at a charity event a cappella She was never comfortable doing that and thats because she wanted Richards arrangements and Richard there and feel like dont think she knew just what a raw beautiful melodic voice she possessed She wanted to have it surrounded by the expertise of her brother For all the beauty of Karens voice ultimately Richard was the key behind The Carpenters unique sound After long enough of being alone There are many songs that they did that thought were quite amazing think it comes down to the way they were arranged Richard had a lot to do with the way the orchestration worked The pain was going through Richard was and is an astonishing instrumentalist great tunewriter Richard had this magic gift of not only great songs but knowing where to find great songs and how to pick them out Maybe you cant see how much you mean to me Richard kind of ranks right up there with Brian Wilson to me He had the same kind of perfectionism and really did some interesting things with the productions and the arrangements he put together And when hold you baby baby feels like maybe things will be all right Are the songs technically Can sit down and play them Yes they are easybreezy But could you match it and beat them Absolutely not Only yesterday when was sad and was lonely As the hits kept coming the demand for new material was high and Richard asked Records to find his old college friend and music partner whom hed not seen since the Spectrum days knew d see them again you know what mean was very proud of and for them and just had this instinct that we would do lots of stuff together The first single and a hit that he and put together was Goodbye To love When you hear a real hepcat Late at night we were home from the studio and they were running an old Bing Crosby film and Bing played a ghostwriter to the successful Basil Rathbone who was going through a dry spell Nothing will ever quite come up to Goodbye To Love Ah wrote that myself mean er That really came from my heart Rathbones most famous song is called Goodbye To Love You never hear it they just refer to it Oh he wrote Goodbye To Love Its no use Willy havent been able to write a good song on my own since Goodbye To Love And heard that title and pictured the opening ll say goodbye to love noone should ever care if live or die Thats all the lyrics came up with but like the And all know of love is how to live without it just cant seem to find it So ve made my mind up must live my life alone Constructing the arrangement to Goodbye To Love er pictured something that was a little off the beaten path two things that ordinarily dont go together which would be a melodic fuzz guitar solo didnt think it was a good idea but what do know Its a soft ballad and nobody had ever put rocknroll guitars on a ballad We heard it on the radio and we were all up in Richards room listening and then the said And theres The Carpenters doing a Jimi Hendrix song They just had to make cracks about it The Js couldnt help themselves cos it was so odd Richard actually got hate mail based on the fact that hed sullied The Carpenters by using a fuzz tone electric guitar We actually wrote Goodbye To Love on one day and Top Of The World on the other It was a good twoday period On top of the world looking down It was and The Carpenters were on top of the world while America was in turmoil with troops being pulled out of Vietnam and President Nixon was on the road to impeachment Your loves put me at the top of the world Being asked to perform at the White House is not only a thrill but indeed an honour Their success was not only domestic They were now truly international superstars To come to a foreign country its really hard for you to think that somebody whos never seen you ever can automatically spot you you know But with the strain of being in the spotlight and a relentless schedule the cracks were beginning to show She definitely as she was a little older began to worry about the weight thing can remember Karen reading and being hurt by quotes dont know if they said Cherubic plump said Why does that bother you And she said But it never leaves me And it became a real monument for her Karen stayed so basic She wanted the white picket fence She just wanted to get married have children be cooking Thanksgiving dinners and that was her real goal in life But then she got into this early success and then youre driven and you want more success and you have to perform and you have to keep on the merrygoround and think that took its toll on her eventually Youre on the road a lot You work what six out of seven days most of the time Just about yeah When we go out on tour its seven days a week The amount of touring in was nuts It wasnt only all of Vegas and Tahoe it was also the and it was Japan and it was nutty When the hell you gonna make an album Richard think to this day feels like he toured too much Test one two test Richard Carpenter Somebody listen to me think it was partly their own desire to realise upon this great opportunity that they had Theyd been working towards this for so many years We had been so laserfocused on success and once it came we knew that you could not let it go And er our personal lives were kinda over there and that left a huge hole They had a manager and an agent who frankly profited greatly from booking them It wasnt very smart All of our success sprang from the records so you dont forget the records and go touring around the world dont think he was ever truly happy on the road because once there was an audience the audience obviously loved and adored Karen There was tremendous love and respect between the two of them but think Richard was jealous Ladies and gentlemen Mr Richard Carpenter You couldnt go and explain to the thousands of people every night who were sitting out in the audience wrote this produced it What they came and they saw is Shes singing it He looks like a piano player back there even though we had lights on him and all of that Learning all the latest records From the radio by ear And was dreaming d be famous when the big surprise appeared She was a five foot four tornado pair of drumsticks in her hand think it bothered Richard that his contribution wasnt recognised as much as it should have been Because he really was the force They did go around the roses at times but think the relationship was really sweet It was tender think they admired each other You never saw such support in your life between artist and producer back and forth as you did with those two And it paid off Stop Oh yes Wait a minute Mr Postman Wait Wait a minute Mr Postman Please Mr Postman Look and see Where earlier said was tripping over the songs wasnt tripping over them so much any more It was getting harder and harder to find really good ones There must be some word today From my boyfriend so far away To be honest Richard procrastinated writing Hed have ideas but wouldnt force himself to sit down and flesh them out didnt feel comfortable saying Weve gotta write a song If theres a letter in your bag for me And of course we were human and the bloom was off the rose It wasnt as exciting as it was when it all first happened It wouldnt be for anybody By the constant touring and studio work had taken their toll on Karens health with visible effect hadnt seen them in a while was away for the summer and when got back to the States went to Las Vegas to go see them and was quite appalled at what her appearance was She had lost considerable weight She was normally loaded with energy and in Vegas she was having to have a lie down between shows which is not like her and of course she was too thin and shed come out in what she thought she looked great in and the audience would gasp Its The Carpenters Stop Oh yes wait a minute Mr Postman Wait Waiaiaiait Mr Postman Mr Postman look and see Oh yeah Usually it was Richard or Richard mostly who would convince her not to go out without putting on a jacket because she had gotten so thin there were truthfully people who came up to me and were convinced that she had cancer If theres a letter letter for me We just thought she was being compulsive in her dieting and in her exercising We would always encourage her to eat and if we were all out to dinner she would have a habit of saying This is delicious Taste this And shed put it on your plate Before you knew it she had put food on other peoples plates and she wasnt eating very much Stop We all knew that something was wrong but we just didnt know what we were dealing with They were supposed to then go immediately to Japan and really didnt see how she could even survive such a trip you know Literally it was bad She was rather gaunt Our secretary of many a year Evelyn Wallace happened to read an article on eating disorders It mentioned anorexia nervosa She brought it to our attention we looked at it and said This looks like it Theres a kind of hush All over the world tonight All over the world You can hear the sound of lovers in love You know what mean Just the two of us You had two people in The Carpenters Karen Carpenter who was killing herself with anorexia that noone in her family would recognise or do anything about and Richard Carpenter falling further and further into a world of Quaaludes Whisper in your ear love you There was a sleeping pill at the time Not being a party animal didnt know it was being used recreationally It was prescribed by my doctor and taken properly it was damn good but it had a side effect of making you a little bit high is what it did and kind of enjoyed that at the end of the day and it got out of hand after a few years certainly by was in trouble It isnt a dream The only sound that you will hear Is when whisper in your ear love you It didnt help that that was going on at the same time Karen was experiencing her problems That meant both of them in their own way were chaotic Instead of getting a little bit annoyed that somebody did this thing youd be raging because somebody did that thing Things came to a head between Richard and his manager while on tour You can shout Were all brothers And even pretend They were playing in Las Vegas Neil Sedaka was the opening act The Carpenters came on afterward And Tom Jones had come from the hotel he was working in to see the show For love is surrender You must surrender if you care When theres a big entertainer who comes to the show the headliner in this case The Carpenters would introduce them Well stupidly Neil Sedaka the opening act introduced Tom Jones Because of that m fired he fired Neil Sedaka that night and subsequently Neil Sedaka fired me for putting him together with The Carpenters In need of a new manager The Carpenters turned to impresario Jerry Weintraub Jerrys plan was to take the duo in a different direction with their own television special People are always asking why Karen plays the drums can answer that in two words why not But Richard still wasnt happy Mentally wasnt in the mood to be doing these things once we finally got one And well have fun fun fun Now that daddy took the Bird away And secondly didnt want anything with skits didnt want canned laughter hate that Karen on the other hand just loved all of this stuff and so she took to them By this point in time when it came to the specials they really should have been Karen specials because what do you do with me m a behindthescenes guy He was so nice about it Richard was It didnt bother him how much screen time gave her because he knew by that time that she was the star As was walking to my car in the parking lot after the show Mrs Carpenter sidled up to me and said Bob wasnt Richard wonderful had to stop a minute because for two cents worth that show would be remembered for Karen Carpenters vocalising Are we really happy With this lonely game we play Looking for the right words to say think Richard had been the favourite or the golden boy while they were growing up and as a result she developed these feelings of low selfesteem and selfdoubt My funny valentine Despite Karens insecurities the shows were a huge success But for Richard the sleeping tablets were causing serious problems was getting to a point couldnt even sign my name couldnt play the piano worth a damn It was do something or die is what it was So with great support from family and friends went off to a rehab January th How is he Well hes coming along talked to him last night He feels a little better What actually happened seriously two days before we were going to come over he caught himself a real nice case of the flu said to her Karen dont know why all of this has happened and it doesnt much matter But m here taking care of my problem its time you face up to yours And remember saying We can go into the s the same way we went into the s We have our talent our record contractyou know we can set the world on fire again Ignoring Richards pleas Karen would not be deterred from her plan to record a solo album When she called she wanted my blessing cant go do this unless know that youre behind it said Other than the fact that dont think youre well enough to do ityou certainly have my blessing know this is something you want Not that its any of my business but do me one favour do not do disco Disco was hot You are not cut out to do disco This is not you Top New York record producer Phil Ramone took on the challenge of producing Karens solo album It was an interesting challenge did not want to go down the road of having an outside Carpenter producer which would be ridiculous for her and for me and tackle things that she really was too comfortable in My body keeps changing my mind Keeps changing my heart Well they played it for the powers that be in Both Gerry Moss and Herb Alpert and Richard were in the control room And it was quite silent the end of like three or four cuts and shes looking at me and m ready to bite my nails and m not sure whats going on It was rather negative shall we say We didnt think it would get a really great reaction and we didnt want to have Karen go through that Its been reported through the years that put the stake through it or our mother came in and said Absolutely not Its all poppycock It was all up to Karen and she listened to all the people whose opinions she respected and it was her decisionand she said Were not putting it out And that was the end of that If there was this lack of support and it wasnt the right move she would rather be known as The Carpenters and it was easier to put on the shelf Work finally began on the next Carpenters album But for Karen a new distraction was just around the corner As a child was known for Well wed hardly gotten started on that in when she meetsthis fellow Tom Burris Like a child He was a dashing real estate man and he had lots of personality and she was so happy Finding answers to my prayer never dreamed that two months later theyd be married It was a whirlwind romance and they got married on August st of Its a new day for those good old dreams And its all because of you She was very anxious to be married but she picked the wrong guy It was the first time d been attracted on the first date Usually you open the door and you go Argh But from then on it Degenerated was worried about it and discussed with her the fact that there was some issues but she was determined know that Karens mom Agnes and Harold tried to counsel her that you know you do have to be careful when you are in the arena that youre in that you marry someone thats not just after money or fame He had a jet plane and he had a boat and er lived lavishly At the end of the day there was really nothing of financial substance left Even like the influence that her family had or that had And he didnt treat her too well Ultimately think he reached the conclusion that the marriage was not successful and wanted it terminated And she agreed with that It was obviously a tough time for her because with the marriage not working out and her being painfully thin she had to know by this time that something was wrong Such a feelings coming over me Richard talked to her about it She went to New York to be in the care of a selfstyled doctor Steven Levenkron treated Karen Carpenter for anorexia He said For all you know in so many words when we get to the bottom of what this is Karen may find out that she doesnt even enjoy being a singer And m thinking Bullshit Is the love that ve found Ever since youve been around Your loves put me at the top of the world think the idea that she would never sing again was an exaggeration The sentiment was that she would like to be able to choose what she does But she probably would have loved to sing to some extent she just needed more say in who she was and how it all happened Play us a song we can slow dance on We wanna hold each other She came back out in April for a visit mean so thin She wanted to cut a few songs She sounded marvellous it didnt matter what shape she was in Touch me when were dancing You know youve got that loving touch Karen headed back to New York but her condition deteriorated and she was admitted to hospital weighing just stone Here she is and m saying Karen this is crap Dont you understand Youre going about this all the wrong way This guy isnt getting anything accomplished cos youre in the hospital When you dont know whats wrong with someone you love usually your reaction is to become afraid and when we get afraid we quite often cover it with anger Unfortunately putting her on the defensive would not have helped It doesnt usually help obsessionals There were rumours that you were suffering from anorexia nervosa No was just pooped was tired out She was the most truthful person ve ever met about almost everything But she lied like a trooper about the anorexia situation You went down to about six stone in weight didnt you have no idea what six stone in weight is Its very difficult to work out About lb No No No The doctors said to be more physical grab Karen and tell her you love her Maybe you know she needs to hear that more And her mother was very hurt by that She loved Karen very deeply and it just was very hurtful to hear doctors say Show her love By Thanksgiving shes decided she wants to of she wants to come home We were just so glad to have her back but we didnt feel that she was in any way a lot better We really differed with the doctor guess on that point She had marvellous eyes The eyes are the window to the soul could see in her eyes that she was not well reported this to our longterm financial advisor who is still with me today and it got back to Karen who found out where was shopping one particular evening When walked out of the department store heres my Jaguar and heres her Jaguar Ohoh This is trouble If she sought out where am then theres trouble And oh she read me the riot act supported you and you should support me And so on said Karen d support you through anything if felt you were doing the right thing but can look right into your eyes and tell that you are not well The only reason that am raising red flags to the folks is because believe you are still sick and love you And am glad said that Within weeks she was dead The last time saw her it was actually two days before she died she had come to my office to review her divorce agreement from her husband And er it had to be revised in a couple of respects so we made a date to sign it on Friday which was the day she died Karen Carpenter died today of cardiac arrest She was just years old spokesman for the family said that Miss Carpenter had battled anorexia nervosa for years Anorexics are compulsive dieters sometimes to the point of starvation Noone actually dies from anorexia nervosa its complications due to But it doesnt much matter in my book She wasnt treated properly and thats all there is to it An autopsy failed to determine the cause of death of Karen Carpenter She died in California today at the age of of cardiac arrest coroner says it could take weeks to find out why she died dont think well ever know what killed Karen do agree with everything ve read that she didnt want to die She wanted to stop the way things were and think she desperately wanted time for herself to think about what she wanted out of her life She felt she didnt have what she wanted But do wish Karen had been here now because we know so much more now It wasnt that she had bad treatment there wasnt enough knowledge When was young d listen to the radio Waiting for my favourite song She was and will always be well loved and well remembered will always love her voice Her legacy is going to be around for a long long time Those were such happy times And not so long ago How wondered was picking up a gift this morning at the mall and heard a song that she was recording while we were dating and just just got goosebumps Its still difficult after all this time Every shalalala Every wohohoh Still shines To me nobody can touch Karen Carpenters emotion That was from another that was another place another time Starting to sing This is a very sad day and at the
