Edward Perrimont Cole died in May It was a Sunday afternoon and there wasnt a cloud in the sky Its difficult to understand the sum of a persons life Some people would tell you its measured by the ones

him again How did she react Called me names you wouldnt believe and worse She said was dead to her m not proud of everything did But m pretty sure ll do it all again so If they wont let me in the Egyptian heaven because my daughter hates me Well then guess thats just the way it goes However you answer your two questions How do we get down from this tomb The emperors wife was Chad Tehan the th

it falls under the category Too Good To Be True In the Sumatra village where the beans are grown Lives a bread of wild tree cats These cats eat the beans digest them And then defecate The villagers then collect and process the stools It is the combination of beans and the gastric ion juices of the tree cats That gives Kopi Luwak its unique flavor and aroma Youre shitting me The cats made me do it You got a pen Give me a pen Laugh Until You Cry Its not finished Its not a one man deal m afraid it will have to be Were ready ll be here when you get back That sounds good to me Dear Edward ve gone back and forth in the last few days trying to deceit whether or not should even write this In the end realized would regretted if didnt So here it goes know the last time we saw each other we werent exactly hitting the sweetest notes It certainly wasnt the way wanted our trip to end suppose m responsible and for that m sorry But in all honesty if had the chance d do it again Virginia said left as a stranger and came back a husband owe that to you Theres no way can repay you for all youve done for me So rather than try just want to ask you to do something else for me Find the joy in your life You ones said youre not like everyone Well thats true youre certainly not everyone But everyone is everyone My pastor always says our lives are streams Flowing in to the same river Towards whatever heaven leys In the mist beyond the falls Hello sweetie Find the joy in your life Edward Kiss The Most Beautiful Girl In The World My dear friend close your eyes And let the waters take you home Good afternoon my name is Edward Cole do not know what most people say on these occasions In all honesty ve tried to avoid them The simplest thing is loved him And miss him Carter and saw the world together It is amazing When you think that only three months ago we were complete strangers Help Complete Stranger For The Good hope it doesnt sound selfish of me But the last months of his life Were the best months of mine He saved my life and he knew it before did m deeply proud That this man found it worth is while to know me In the end think its safe to say that we brought some joy to one anothers lifes So one day When go to some final resting place And happen to wake up next to a certain wall with a gate hope that Carter is there To vouch for me And show me the ropes on the other side Edward Perrimont Cole died in May It was on a Sunday afternoon And there wasnt a cloud in the sky He was years old Witness Something Majestic Even now cant claim to understand the measure of a life But can tell you this know that when he died His eyes were closed And his heart was open And m pretty sure he was happy with his final resting place Because he was buried on a mountain And that was against the law
