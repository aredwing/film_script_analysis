This is a tremendous moment The war is over cry a little think of my dearest friends of those men fighting in the services ve known Piccadilly was already a seething mass of people The hoarding around Eros was crowded with young people mainly from the Forces People were everywhere On shop fronts up lamp standards singing and shouting can remember my father taking me to school one day There was a house absolutely flat on the floor and a woman standing outside and saying only washed my windows yesterday The nurses home was hit in Then again in the whole hospital was hit and it was completely destroyed The main surgeon Mr Grey he was killed and quite a few of the doctors and nurses And two wards of maternity with about babies and mothers and other casualties as well always Every rd of May could go over it again When we go strolling in the park at night All the darkness is a boon Who cam if were without a light They cant black out the moon see you smiling in the cigarette glow Though the picture fades too soon But see all Kiss me once Then kiss me twice Then kiss me once again Its been a long long time Havent felt like this my dear Since cant remember when Its been along Underlying our joy and thankfulness there is one uneasy question What about the future What will happen now Will we the people who have won the war drive home our victory against fascism By defeating our prewar enemies of poverty and unemployment think the expectation was We are not going back to the Britain of the s Were It was never again It wasnt only never again about war It was never again about that kind of peace where everything was run by rich people for rich people The mood among the people that was with was that basically it was them and us The officers were on one side of the barrier and we were on the other side of the barrier People were all very much afraid that what happened after the First World War would happen after the second which was enormous poverty and adversity mean worked with people in the last war who basically between the wars had gone long periods without any jobs at all dont think people were greedy for a lot of things those days They just wanted to live peaceful have a job have children and have a home life think just everybody wanted a good home life with their families you know was born years ago in the slums of Liverpool off Great Homer Street a street called Mellor Street was one of eight children And we slept five in a bed In my bed there was three lads and two girls We got into bed of a night with a bed full of vermin When say full of vermin mean the bugs The fleas were in hundreds in the beds And we got in the beds There was nothing we could do about it because they were in the building behind the wallpaper in the skirting boards And we just got in that bed and lived with them And next morning when we went to school we would have the cane for having dirty knees Every Monday morning we were meant to take the bundles up to the pawn shops which were in the city area And d get on the trams and the tram conductor would say Dalgleish is the next stop Browns ll be at Browns giving a good price today ladies And when it got to the terminus hed say All away Poverty Park And it really was a poverty park The s for me can remember quite vividly was no shoes on my feet Having spoonfuls of malt this horrible malt when we went into school to try and stop the rickets And coming home from school and you could smell some food coming from somewhere Then all we used to have was a bowl of com flakes or something like that Coming home in the evening youd probably have a big big plate full of swedes and potatoes with no meat They didnt have a carpet on the floor And when we used to visit theyd scrubbed the floorboards And if theyd just scrubbed the floorboards they actually literally had paper down on the floor My grandfathers suit had to go into the pawn shop on the Monday in order that they had some money not only to live but also for the youngest son vino had a kidney complaint to pay for his doctors fees Then theyd get it out again when he got his money on a Friday so that he could wear his suit to go to the pub Bread and jam was the usual thing they had They talk about bread and dripping You had to have beef to make dripping so the chances of having dripping were remote It was more often than not bread and jam In our house there was three children died between the ages of two and four Two died at the same time And can recall putting two coffins across our knees in a onehorse coach and the onehorse coach taking us to the cemetery And as recall them two coffins went on top of other coffins at the cemetery The other thing can remember about the s was the long periods when because of the militancy they closed the pit down altogether and we had to go picking coal off the tips My grandfather and my father when they heard the steam engine the steam train passing they would come out to the back of the house to count the number of trucks that were going up to the colliery because with that knowledge they would know then whether they had work for a day or two or for the week They used to call it the umbrella pit because it was constantly opening and closing My father took me down to see the dole queue in Liverpool and then he walked me the full length of it Then he walked me back so could see all their faces And he said Now remember that Remember that and dont let it happen in your day And was ten We went to all the meetings in those days They were mostly out in parks or street corners And got quite used to it so was really pretty well educated as regards politics What really matters is who controls industry and the result of industry Hear hear This rubbish about the banking system is the greatest Hear hear You dont make money you dont make wealth by passing bits of paper to one another Close up the ranks Fall in Join the great army of the children of the night marching to the conquest of the future Marching to build Jerusalem in Englands green and pleasant land was years of age when read my first book The RaggedTrousered Philanthropists It just completely changed my life couldnt sleep after reading The RaggedTrousered Philanthropists just thought what fools everyone are How weve all been taken in and were still being taken in Were just sucked into a false life of what its all about When we were living in the slums off Great Homer Street we were the greatest empire in the world We had India Africa Canada Australia The greatest empire in the world We were living in the worst slums in Europe My dad used to take an orange box round to the docks and urge the dockers to join a union to band together with all the other Youll never get anywhere if you dont Youve got to be solid You know was quite proud to go with him could hear the men saying Its Johnny and the kid So was quite proud to be the kid with Johnny Well ve been thinking about the gaps between the houses What comes down has to go up again you know Not like it used to be hope Not with all those slums and tenements Thats just the point Weve got to see that the jobs done decently this time Ya but how Do you think we can do anything about it Well why not If we can work together now to look after the lives of the people here dont see why we couldnt work together afterwards to clear up the mess and help build a better world in which these things cant possibly happen ll second that Its people like us that have been doing the work of the war and its people like us that are going to do the work of the peace My mind goes back to a meeting we had in a troop ship Then one lad got up He said In the s we had mass unemployment He said We dont have unemployment in wartime He said if you can have full employment killing Germans why cant you have full employment building homes building houses building schools recruiting teachers recruiting nurses recruiting doctors And that argument registered Were starting something called Were going to have an hours discussion every week on current affairs And its going to come out of working time If there is injustice inequality ifs our fault for allowing it Why not write to your about it Yes thats just it Weve got a parliament and its up to us to say who goes there and to make sure they do their job when they get there am more and more suspicious of the way this lecturingto and education of the forces racket is run maintain most strongly that any of these subjects which tend towards politics are wrong For the love of life do do something about it unless you want to have the creatures coming back all pansy pink The experience of the war taught people that when the stale needs you lo be organised collectively in fact theyll force you into the army to be organised collectively and you can be incredibly powerful You can defeat fascism And they came back imbued with that spirit of saying anything is possible Beveridge a Liberal had been given the task of looking at the world after the war and he identified five giants Poverty unemployment illness and so on Want must not be known again There must be no mass unemployment the giant evil of only yesterday Ignorance said Sir William no democracy can nowadays afford The evil of disease must be overthrown The voluntary hospital and the expensive nursing home are not enough to maintain this nation in good health We are not fighting to preserve slums which breed our own diseases just as swamps breed malaria No more generations must be stunted in squalor The Beveridge Report shows how to begin overthrowing the five giant evils It spurs us all to greater effort If we can produce so much for war much can be done for peace Youve got to realise there was only years between two wars And most of the electorate were well aware of the fact that after the First World War we had men out of work we had men standing on street corners in blue uniforms with no leg or no arm something wrong and there was no jobs for them dont think anybody wanted to ever see that again Put Labour in Vote Conservative Socialism must win Vote Liberal m for Churchill Attlees the man Posters to the right of them posters to the left of them volley and thunder On July th the Partly the Tory Party was broken in its core because of its attachment to appeasement So the coalition government Churchill who comes to head in the war is actually a Labour administration at its core At its core meaning the ministries in charge of industry and employment and so forth are under Labour ministers Churchills at the head of this Having come through the s where there was mass unemployment coming through the war years where there was you know rationing and lack of food and where the housing standard was very poor right across the country people whod fought in the war people whod supported the economy in the war effort they were looking for some son of if you like it was like a war or peace dividend Those were the key things that they were looking for And thats what the Labour Party Manifesto really addresses mean people looked back at the years of the s the s saw the mass unemployment the wars the revolutions the appearance of the dictators the misery that was caused and said you know Theres something about the system as it worked then which was almost inescapable Weve got to change it My father was not an active trade unionist or anything He got a map of the world and he put it on the table and he said Look He said They grow wheat here you get rubber from here you get oil from here and you get fruit from here What were looking for is an integrated world system where everybody has what they need and everything is developed for everybody thought that was absolutely amazing He said to me Its called socialism And you know as a kid of ten thought it was absolutely amazing and still do All for one one for all Well ifs not greed No greed and selfishness Labour puts first things first Security from war food houses clothing employment leisure and social security for all must come before the claims of the few for more rent interest and profit We have shown that we can organise the resources of the country to win the war We can do the same in peace Churchill and the Tories went so far as to print tens of thousands of copies of Friedrich von Hayeks The Road to Serfdom which is a book that basically says if you start off interfering with the economy just a little bit if the government just does just a little bit you set off down the road towards totalitarianism You end up with Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia just by introducing a little bit of welfare spending or maybe nationalising the odd industry The Tories printed this What a shame it would be and what a folly to add to our load the bitter quarrels with which the extreme socialists are eager to convulse and exploit these critical years For the sake of the country and of your own happiness call upon you to march with me under the banner of freedom towards the beacon lights of national prosperity and honour which must ever be our guide The election was fantastic During the war wed always sat and listened to Winston Churchill on the radio Everybody did Everybody sat round the radio and listened to Winston Churchill And as a kid mean that was it to me He was the leader This was you know incredible And say this is no time to mince about to mince measures and fool around with weak governments Therefore say if you do not give a strong vote to the National and Conservative government which And then suddenly my family started talking about something quite different We sat round and my father said they were going to vote Labour And asked well what did that mean He explained and said Why arent you voting for Winston Churchill And he said He got the guns out to the Tonypandy miners can only tell you that an enormous mass of work And we campaigned Number Downing Street So we went there and the whole domestic staff were turned out It was like Upstairs Downstairs And the butler said Were all Conservative in this house The maid at the back with the little bonnet said And wed lose our jobs if we werent Labour will now have a majority over all parties in a House of It was sensational Three weeks ago or more when you recorded your votes very few of you would have prophesied a working majority for Labour much less one of about seats Newspapers carried the astonishing news to an amazed public Labour landslide On the polling day went to Transport House into the little room where we were watching the results On the epidiascope we saw all the Conservative seats falling And it was obviously a landslide Then the door opened Out of the bright sunshine into the dark room came Clem Attlee man said Will you say Three cheers for the Prime Minister And was too shy to do that Then that evening went to Central Hall Westminster Attlee had just formed the government and he brought them onto the stage was up in the gallery And so it was a very very exciting period This is the first time in the history of this country that a Labour movement with a socialist policy have this evening accepted His Majestys permission to form ask from you all support that we shall need to carry us through triumphantly through difficult years to the great era which is opening before us It was a real triumphant day Everybody was joyous We had a little street party where we were living It was a signal that things were going to be different One wasnt going to be ruled by old principles There used to be messages coming down on top of the empty drams saying Labour seats here We won four seats All of a sudden he come out and said Labour won a landslide victory And these hardened miners And they were a hard kin They were rough and they were tough you know what mean They would take anything that the boss ever ever threw at them but the tears were coming down their cheeks because said to my miner said Well whats the matter He said At last We are going to take control of our own lives he said This new government will make a change he said There was no wild optimism at least not in the higher ranks of the civil service and the government because everyone knew that we faced an almost impossible economic situation The country had sold all its foreign investments It had lost most of its ships it had entirely run out of dollars and industry was about threequarters engaged in producing munitions of war which you no longer wanted The economy had to grow very very rapidly at the end of the Second World War If you could imagine that only Britain and the United States it was only those countries industrial capacity that survived to any extent The rest had been razed to the ground or had been dismantled by the Nazis primarily So the world actually needed a lot of manufactured goods to be made But Britain had gone through a tenyear period of depression So at the end of the war Britain had a very key role to basically fill this gap in products around the world And British industry was very very weak So the government decided that the key if you like inputs and infrastructure that industry required had to be nationalised on a very large scale to be able to step up that production We said we would bring the pits into public ownership the railways into public ownership we would build up the National Health Service we would build up industry generally and presented it in terms of this list of objectives you might have in wartime This is what youve got to do and well do it And it was credible for that reason Of course for the Labour Party the natural language for trade unionists and for people struggling together is that we should own things together Its not Lets fight each other to see who can get on top of the other one and benefit The Peasants Revolt You have John Ball who is a you know hedge priest a priest whos been basically expelled from the state Church but is continuing to preach to the commonality He says that nothing will go well in England until all things are held in common It reoccurs in the th century in the English Revolution with the diggers who take over St Georges Hill in Surrey and begin to till the land as common land It reoccurs in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution when the utopian socialists like Robert Owen set up factories He was himself a factory owner but he sets up a kind of model community with the idea that it will have all things held in common that there will be some degree of control in it So all the way through human history in one guise or another this thought is constantly being reiterated suppressed goes underground explodes again in a different form In all their many jobs they are Britain Public services Manual workers Cleaners Caterers Street sellers Government workers Distributive trades Women workers Miners Transport drivers Steel men For seven years we the people of Britain fought a war for mankind Today we fight for our own survival This battle also we shall win cant recall properly how we got medical attention think there was a place we went to a dispensary It was a huge place and there was always a queue there every time you went dispensary of some sort And you got some son of medicines there But obviously it wasnt working because funerals were always going about Well before the health service money was the prime mover or lack of it think a farm worker got six shillings a week He would probably pay a shilling rent on that That left him very very little and most had large families The money was not there so they turned to folk remedies Oh my grandma knows what to do with that type thing For instance tonsillitis theyd get someone that had got sweaty socks and something out of the sweat theyd put round their neck and that was supposed to cure them but quite often it resulted in ear infection For the working man or the working woman there was National Health insurance cover The panel You got onto the doctors list Your family did not Your family might be covered by some son of little insurance scheme The Hospital Saturday Fund or sixpence or a shilling a week that you paid for each in the hope that if anything did happen youd be able to get some son of cover for care You had to pay And My mother was quite sick at the time My father was having to go to work in agony needing surgery but because they didnt pay sick pay This was before the railways were nationalised They didnt pay sick pay so he was going to work in agony to pay five shillings for the doctor to put his foot on that doormat That was before you got any help you know advice on what was wrong with you or anything But the soandso knew my mother was dying so kept coming back for his five shillings The doctors were private people They used to come and visit you Theyd charge you maybe half a crown a visit Then theyd probably charge you half a crown for a bottle of medicine or something of that kind And very often youd got say three or four in a family that wanted treatment at the same time well the doctor would do it on credit and then he would often double up as a credit collector We used to have collectors who used to come on a Friday at half past three ready to get out on the streets by four oclock The secret was to get the collector into the patients home before the insurance agent arrived because if they paid the insurance agent first there was never any money left for the doctors collector So you would occasionally go to a house walk up to the door You could hear life going on behind the door And as soon as you knocked at the door dead silence Dead silence and you thought m sure heard somebody Knock again still dead silence On one occasion a little girl eventually came to the door and said My mum says shes not in My mother was on her tenth child and she sent me up to get the nurse run up and get the nurse because every child had to be born at home She came down and could just hear mumbling and going on up there heard the baby crying Then the next thing see my mother being carried downstairs on a stretcher And my brothers was crying Optimistic said Our mam is going to be alright Dont worry about Mam Mam is good And as she went past she just squeezed my hand Somehow knew things werent right and she came home from school that day and my cousin had come round to me He put his arm round me and he said Ray Mam is dead And of course cried my eyes out And what really set the fire going inside me was when my father was also crying The doctor put his hand out and he said George he said Winnie died he said for the want of a pint of blood And he said Winnie died for a hospital bed He said Winnie died for the want of an abortion ran up to the mountain with my mothers bonnet and said to that God up there Because we all went to chapel We were strong chapel If youre a decent God up there said my mam was the most wonderful woman in the world My brothers and sisters have just been dragged off to the orphanage Give us our mam back Give me my family back genuinely believed when went to bed that night that my mam would come back the next morning From that point on was an atheist because realised that the only thing the only persons that could improve the situation was ourselves This leaflet is coming through your letterbox one day soon or maybe youve already had your copy Read it carefully It tells you what the new National Health Service is and how you can use what it offers Hospitals and specialist services medicines drugs and appliances care of the teeth care of the eyes maternity services home health services The grand ambition really was to provide healthcare as necessary to the public at large It was very exciting you know One knew that there wasnt very much stuff around to do it with We had old stock the hospitals we had very maldistributed medical services across the country There were some areas which were very poorly supplied with hospital services Bevan was an extraordinary man He nationalised the whole damn lot Everything that claimed to be a hospital was nationalised which was not at all what the Labour Party had expected or voted for They had all expected for the hospitals to be owned and run by local authorities by local government He made a lot of enemies that way But you the public are interested in health no less than doctors and in health services too We all want better health services and better health but in organising them lets make sure that your doctor doesnt become the states doctor Nye Bevan was demonised as m sure youre well aware The British media have a way of picking on somebody and turning them into a demon They were aided and abetted in that by the who regarded him as evil incarnate Its obviously quite a job sending out the plebiscite to doctors asking them roughly speaking whether they approve of Mr Bevans scheme Lord Moran as president of the Royal College of Physicians did the deal with Nye Bevan which brought the into existence He managed to persuade Bevan to drop the notion of a salaried service for general practitioners That sort of killed a lot of the fear amongst general practitioners But he also got the agreement to allow private practice to continue for the consultants and also for merit awards and various other things which as you may recall enabled Nye Bevan to say shortly afterwards when asked how hed done it stuffed their mouths with gold Well this is the birth of the National Health Service This is Nye Bevan and the matron Anne Dolan walking from the main building down towards a gate They said this was handing over the key of the hospital There wasnt a key handed over It was just That was just the way they said the health service was born The thing that stands out it sounds so petty this but we had jam scones for tea Do you remember that Each and every one of us Food was still rationed We had jam scones for tea and oh dear God that was marvellous never met the man myself but do realise that he was a visionary He was very very passionate about this vision of his admire anyone who can take and drive through a scheme that big countrywide People dont have to worry about being ill When they are ill they know that they will get the best possible impartial treatment because theres no commercial element to the relationship between a doctor and a patient So if you go to your doctor you know the advice that you get will be based on whats best for you clinically It wont be about selling you care if you can afford it or withholding care from you if you cant afford it d been to see a family in which there was a child that was coughing pretty sick So left a bottle of medicine as one did in those days came back the next day and the mother met me at the door said Hows little Johnny And she said Oh hes fine heard a lot of coughing and spluttering at the top of the stairs said He doesnt sound terribly good Would you like me to go up and see him She said Well Doctor no its not Johnny ifs Bill his brother ve given him some of the medicine that you left for Johnny said Well let me go up and see him She said m sorry Doctor We cant afford it And said Today July th itll cost you nothing And was able to go up and ve never forgotten that moment in my life Dentures Of course dentistry was free under the initially It jolly well aint now as know it But think that was it There was this huge surge People got spectacles for the first time in their lives actually know one old man who carried it around with him It was the bottom of a bottle a glass bottle He used to use that as a spyglass to read with He got his first pair of specs when he was about Julian Tudor Hart is an extraordinary He works in a small mining village in the Welsh valleys called Glynncorrwg There he revolutionised the way Ps provide care for their patients They identified all those people who they knew needed looking after The people with high blood pressure So they made a register and they called them in Instead of saying Come back when you feel sick they said m going to see you regularly and sort your blood pressure out By so doing they reduced the deaths by complications by nearly percent Ever since then weve had proactive healthcare think we can use the health service as a model for socialism think we can learn how to be socialist in the health service think the health service a free service where we pool the risks so that everybody feels responsible for everybody else we are our brothers keepers and our sisters keepers Hiya Tom Good morning Doc How are you think my chest is worse than usual think caught a cold m full up Feeling comfortable with being your brothers and your sisters keeper is very very important It means you are a more civilised country am very proud that our country produced the National Health Service If were an American would be ashamed that live in such a rich country that still cant afford to have generous ideas Well thered been a debate going on for almost years about the benefits of nationalisation of the railways They saw the waste and the duplication of railway lines and the bureaucracy of the private companies and said that society would benefit from public ownership It formed a sort of unstoppable argument to say that the railways had to be nationalised for the public interest and also in order to rebuild the country It was a queer system of working because we could have a train leave Exeter Central going say down to North Devon and he could go down the bank and stay there minutes for a pathway through Exeter St Davids because the signalmen on the Great Western were told to give preference to the Great Western You were working against each other The whole history of the railways in Britain is an example of why railways are a natural monopoly Numerous railway lines were built often connecting the same cities together Subsequently the companies that owned them went bankrupt The clear lesson of that is that the railways are a natural monopoly in the same way that providing drinking water or providing electricity or gas or any other utility item In by Act of Parliament Britain set up the British Transport Commission Its task To make all transport work as one Dont forget it wasnt the nationalisation of the railways It was public ownership of all forms of transport which was road haulage it was airways it was you know everything that and the canals everything One of the first dramatic steps was to get rid of something in Euston called the clearing house which was a huge office full of about clerks whose job was to pass chitties from one to another representing charges from one private railway company on another private railway company for use of their engines their wagons their rolling stock their signal boxes whatever it might be So there was a sort of a paper economy to represent the charges and the notional costs between the different private railway companies which employed hundreds and hundreds of clerks in essentially a completely unnecessary task In with the creation of the British Railways Board that clearing house was abolished and those clerks went to do other jobs productive socially useful jobs in the railway industry The advertising department seemed to have a heyday because they recruited more staff and they had ladders and buckets of paste and so forth They were altering everything Wages increased under nationalisation Eventually in the s it brought about probably the most important industrial agreement in Britain ever negotiated by trade unions which was an agreement which effectively meant no compulsory redundancies for railway workers Without rhythm train could never go without rhythm troop could never roll without rhythm The day would never go because rhythm Is the thing that makes the world go round Without rhythm poet couldnt rhyme without rhythm Could never tell the time without rhythm Wouldnt hear the chime because rhythm Is the thing that makes the clock go round In the s first of all there was a tremendous depression in the coalface The mines were run by private enterprise They were opened and closed at the drop of a hat Markets determined whether miners worked or did not work and it was a really really bad period On the onset of war obviously the government couldnt allow these coal owners to run the mines in the fashion theyd run them before not only opening and shutting but a lack of investment which showed tremendously up the inadequacies of the industry The coal industry was vital during the war Thats why the government the National government had to take over the control of the coalmines The priority was coal The priority was always coal You got paid for the number of drams coal tubs that you filled per day You didnt get paid for putting props up to keep the roof up And was working with my miner and he was a lovely guy was looking at the top and could see that we hadnt got any posts up We should have put the posts up but then the horse come up with an empty tub They said if you can fill this quick well give you another one So bugger the post bugger the props smash into the coal And then all of a sudden down came the roof Down came the roof Now was on the far end of it and got covered But when looked up could see Fred could see Fred He was under this huge rock and his feet were kicking And screamed and run down got the big big wedge which we put in front of the drams in case it runs away ran up and was screaming Fred Fred Fred tried to knock this was screaming all the time it happened and the other miners were all coming down Eventually we picked it up but Fred was dead And why did he die He died because the priority was coal And the least priority of all was safely Theres only one word to describe the coal owners They were tyrants They were tyrants who not only owned the mines they thought they owned the people who worked in the mines And to a degree they did mans sons had been stealing apples off a tree in the coal owners grounds The man was dismissed and thrown out of his house That was the type of people that were running the mining industry in Durham Some were related to the royal family of all people The BowesLyons were big coal owners in Durham Lord Lambton was a big coal owner in Durham Lord Londonderry was a big coal owner in Durham These people were there for only one thing Profit They made sure they got profit and anyone who stood in their way was treated very very harshly When you look at Denaby and Cadeby what happened there They evicted all the miners for withdrawing their labour The miners and their families Threw em out of their homes just because they withdrew their labour to increase the wages Them sort of people are despicable That is the right word isnt it One of the ceremonies marking the transfer of the ownership of British coalmines took place on the roof of Lansdowne House in London where Lord Hyndley the chairman hoisted the National Coal Board flag And so the mines passed into national ownership on the first day of the New Year Though nationalisation is of course a longterm policy January st was undoubtedly the day the miners had been waiting for We had these fantastic speeches and the cheers were going up At last were going to have safety in the mine Were going to have water infusion in the colliery Safety is going to be the key priority We have won And thought What a wonderful day And everybody was cheering laughing crying dancing Even the wives were up there as well At High Blantyre Lanarkshire is Andrew McNulty veteran fighter for miners rights and contemporary of Bob Smillie and William Small Above Dickson Pit where his father and grandfather victims of two great disasters lie buried McNulty unfurls the flag of the National Coal Board The ceremonies mark the taking over of the mines by the nation When was the youngest member in they unveiled a plaque They just sent for us down there Never got nowt like You had to still do the same shift My father had to come up with us My father thought d done something wrong He said What have you been doing now says havent done owt wrong They took us up and unveiled the plaque They had the youngest member was the youngest member and the oldest member somebody called Ford The atmosphere wasnt quite the same this year For the first time the management was invited This was the first Durham rally since the pits were handed to the people Coal Board representatives took part in the celebrations The mines were now owned by the people and run for and on behalf of the people The elderly miners obviously it was their utopia Theyd been promised this since The whole country is watching to see how this great new organisation this new adventure this new experiment comes out The great experiment of socialism in a democracy depends on you The way nationalisation was done was on a centralized system top down The chairman of the National Coal Board ran all the pits in the way the private owner used to m not saying it wasnt a better system because it was But at the same time the idea that people vino worked in industry had any say in how the industry was run was a completely foreign idea got myself well annoyed ll tell you for why leopard cannot change its spots We had officials at this colliery that still had that in their mind you know that they would not pull their weight the same as they would under private enterprise In fact at a meeting of the consultative committee accused them of indirect sabotage of production since the mines were nationalised And say the best thing we could have done when the mines was nationalised put them into a boat with a false bottom and put them into North Sea and let them swim back Thats what they should have done Now the first humiliation ever got was our own agent and manager m going to quote his name on this incident He was called Major Brookes He was publicly denounced as a tyrant by our own lodge officials in the branch because of his attitude towards the men tyrant And yet that man was made chairman of the Regional Coal Board That was the first humiliation You can understand how felt Whos put him there This was the Labour government Now the second incident m standing against Manny Shinwell at Durham He was Ministry of Fuel and Power He gets up and he says take great pride in being the man responsible for appointing Lord Hyndley as chairman of the National Coal Board Lord Hyndley spoke against nationalisation didnt believe in it says What sort of a nationalisation have we got The same old hand back in power think the rest of the communities the welfares the libraries the reading rooms the miners homes that was improved under nationalisation Dramatically improved under nationalisation But in the pits it was still the same old struggle Our safety improved tremendously Safety committees were set up Investment went in which meant safety was more important It must have felt like it was the beginning of a new world It succeeded because you had central planning The capital cost of building power stations and transmission systems across the whole of the in currentday costings youre talking tens of billions of pounds so you needed central control to be able to fund such an operation Most of the gas water and electricity was part of the local authority councilrun services There was no national structure to it Gas electricity water They tend to form natural monopolies They tend to be things that can only be done efficiently on a very very large scale Theres not much point building two separate distribution systems of water in a city You have one and everybody uses it because its the same stuff that comes out of the tap If you allow private competition to be that one supplier all the advantages that are claimed for private enterprise suddenly disappear So you take it into public ownership and that way you can set the prices you can set longterm investment for the utility you can start to control and manage how the things distributed At the end of the war we had two problems We had the inherited slums from the s and we had the war damage We had millions of people coming home from the war wanting to get married set up home and there was an acute housing shortage So what the Labour government did was to authorise local authorities to build houses for rent rather than for sale think its very hard on the young people out of the forces newly married who dont stand a chance at all should be really very happy when my husband comes home and have a house for him to come to from Singapore Well only want to say put my application in in and m still waiting for a house Why With repeated applications renewed Well ve been married six years now Two children and in one room only One room for four think its a shame Its about time something was done used to go queue up at the council offices every Monday morning and thered be a queue about a mile long all the women grumbling of course Everybody trying to get in there One particular morning this lady came out in a fur coat and held up a key ve got one she said let him lock the door and have what he wanted So said Well if thats the way m going to get one ll go without Well they told us wed have to have another points at least before we stood a chance of having a place Wed always planned to have four children So said to Ben Well lets have another baby Well get a house then So after a lot of persuasion we decided We had another baby We got down there and they said Were very sorry Mrs Adams but about other couples did the same as you that night And we were back to square one in a worse position really with another baby on the way and you know no place to put it We had to find out everything about this great city we were planning to rebuild Everything about its history and its geography its people and the way they live We had to find out how much of it had been totally destroyed and how much of it was in such a bad state that it would have to be rebuilt anyway And that didnt just mean the bombed buildings The housebuilding programme is enormous Target of homes a year constructed after the end of the war This is an economy that is absolutely battered as a result of six years of total warfare So the scale of the ambition of what was being achieved is really quite unbelievable First lets look at one of the neighbourhoods and see how thats arranged Here near the centre is the junior school The people would live in streets or squares of terraced houses each with its own private garden So its not an inhuman plan at all but one that is designed to make life better and pleasanter for all of us And so we started in with great expectations with great enthusiasm to try and build the new London to make good all the devastation of wartime to really provide a new London for the people who deserved it trying to give them a better kind of environment than theyd ever had before It was Bevan He was the Minister for Health and Housing He very much saw the need for housing in terms of the knockon effects poor housing was having on health The need at the present time is to build houses for poor people am not prepared to associate myself with a policy where welltodo people can afford to build luxury homes and poor people go without homes His attitude was Nothing but the best is good enough for the working class We are going to have really good houses And he built really good houses The Labour government not only housed people they housed them well The broadest objective was human welfare Human welfare in terms of health so that everybody could be healthy everybody could have a reasonable diet everybody could have a reasonable space to live in There would be no illnesses consequent on bad housing so obviously housing was the most important priority He insisted on certain minimum standards which many at that time thought were probably too good for ordinary workingclass people shall never forget the uproar that occurred when he proposed to put upstairs and downstairs loos in order that the kids didnt have to go upstairs every time they came in from the garden Planning is absolutely important mean if you look at all the most successful housing developments where there are libraries and parks and even a swimming pool and all sorts of facilities provided as part of the development or whether its the new towns The schools were being planned alongside the housing and the doctors surgeries and the employment So it was just perfect for young families The new house had French windows We laid in this room on these mattresses When we woke up in the morning there was all this light There were stairs and a bathroom You know like that So yes it were brilliant Me and my dad we set about building a garden You loved to get rocks and make rockeries and do all that So yes it were brilliant moved into a council house not long after got married It was the best thing that ever happened in my life To see a house with a bathroom in it and a back garden was completely taken in And the council houses for people in them days was the bat thing that ever happened for them My grandfather started to hear about the newtown proposals after the election So they applied for a council house He was offered work building the houses This arrived in April only a year after Stevenage was designated as a new town Dear sir am now able to inform you that the house will be ready for your occupation about th of April The rent will be until further notice shillings and four pence per week including rates and water charges Yours faithfully Clerk of the Council Ah gosh And this is some photographs of him with his workmates building various things in the new town Thats the bandstand that he built You say he carried this round with him Yes he carried it in his wallet for the rest of his life There were only a few things he carried in his wallet The telegram he received when he was working in the West Country to say my mother had been born and the letter of commendation hed got from the Festival of Britain So it was up there in the sort of great events of his life think think the achievements of that government rank alongside the achievements of any other government thats ever been anywhere in the world think that took British people from real real poverty where they didnt have any hope It brought full employment it brought housing it brought many many opportunities The people who got that through should be looked upon as workingclass heroes They lifted us from an era when poverty was rife when illness was rife and it allowed everybody to have healthcare from the cradle to the grave And anybody vino tampers with that people should attack them in as many ways as possible Life is just a bowl of cherries So live and laugh at it all would just like to remember some words of St Francis of Assisi which think are really just particularly apt at the moment Where there is discord may we bring harmony Where there is error may we bring truth Where there is doubt may we bring faith And where there is despair may we bring hope Along came Thatcher and suddenly it was all about the individual You know the important thing was lets get rich and its all about me And the public services really suffered under this British industry had become uncompetitive because of a lack of investment The second factor was that there was a mass overcapacity in the worlds you know production bases And suddenly it all came to a crashing halt in the mid s and then again at the end of the s And Britain and the world was faced with trying to reduce the industrial capacity But also in Britain in particular they tried to increase the rate of profit And theres a real intellectual assault on the ideas of Keynesianism of nationalisation of state intervention which Margaret Thatcher starts to carry through Buys into it wholesale So rather than the state being seen in its traditional reformist role as something which controls industry and is a partial barrier between the working population and the free market it becomes something which facilitates the influence of the free market in privatising and deregulating the economy and in generating the dismantling of the welfare state It was driven really by people like Milton Friedman and the Chicago School who developed a model of capitalism which said that capitalism should be completely uncontrolled that it should be let rip in every direction every form of control removed and that it would find its own solutions under its own momentum It meant actually taking on the working class to reduce their wages but also you know for the redundancies that we saw in steel in shipbuilding in the coal industry And it was a necessity of if you like the private economy And that means they have to break the unions It means they have to have the ability to hire and fire It means they have to have the ability to reduce wages and welfare These treble lines of blue that escort the scabs through the gates where the pickets cannot picket They cannot talk to them They cannot get to them They cannot get anywhere near Now the police are not neutral That is very important The police have been shown to the British people that theyre not neutral when the working class decided to fight for their rights This is the thing you want to be filming Its a police state You saw yourselves There was men just standing on the car park The police came in inciting pushing men about If thats not police incitement dont know what is There are slanderous tongues Always ready to wrong And murder the fine reputation Of the lads with big feet Who by pounding the beat Are protecting the peace of the nation They got me on the floor spreadeagled me a copper on each arm one on each leg Then they started to hit my arms and legs with a truncheon methodically until had no power or grip left in my arms Then they just proceeded to twist them straight up my back think he wanted to take it home for a souvenir Now why do police go in with such venom They seem to enjoy inflicting pain and suffering on the working man Why Who tells them to go beat a pickets head Who tells them to inflict pain try to kill him Because thats what theyre doing You stand there in the push and all you feel all of a sudden a fell a at the side of you collapses in a pile on the floor Whats up with you Hes just been kneed in the groin ve seen police do it ve no skin left on my shins where theyve run their boots down your shin But if you look at him the wrong way youre nicked want to know who gives them the power to do this Who tells them to beat me a working man with a stick Who is it want to know think it was a betrayal of the British people because the mines were owned since by the government for and on behalf of the British people Theres no work whatsoever in these communities No industry is being brought in none whatsoever Without work you cannot have dignity and you cannot have respect At least in mining it was rough and it was tumble but you got the comradeship You got discipline lot of it was selfdiscipline that you taught yourself You were reliant upon each other You were making sure that anybody working with you learnt how to do the job properly because it could be your life at risk and not only theirs Communities are full of drugs theyre full of problems of all sorts of types that were never there when the mines were working What that government done destroyed all them structures that you had all your nationalised industries and although they always gave her fantastic credit for giving working men and women ownership of their own homes thought one of the biggest disasters was the selling off of council houses We all lived in crofts and avenues Nice houses all you know close to where you were working on top of the docks in Birkenhead where lived But they were good houses good houses And the people there were decent people good people good neighbourhoods Were looking after the people in Liverpool now Everyone else has deserted us so well look after our own We are disgusted over it that that union is throwing the towel in and were not Were not going to throw the towel in yet until we get a proper deal Theres no such thing as registered dockers now Anyone goes on them docks now theyre just going there doing a job and then getting chased So thats it Its souldestroying The situation we have now youve got maybe two generations in the family whove never never been in employment Because of the nature of the trade union Labour leadership theyve virtually capitulated Theres been no serious opposition The miners were left in isolation The dockers were left in isolation when they fought their last struggle in the s And the trade union laws prevent the trade unions organising collectively against political decisions Now as far as m concerned the should say Well were not interested in your laws Lets organise and defeat these people That hasnt happened When you start a debate Will we be able to build the next stage of massive power stations dont believe that the current companies one can afford it and have got the ability to actually coordinate and plan it They are all competing with each other across the whole country They cant sit down and actually say We need one power station in Scotland or We need a supplementary power station in the east coast of Britain think thats where the historical planning of one body that was responsible for the production of electricity planning could deliver Within three or four years that had developed into an absolute farce and then a tragedy with repeated fatalities largescale loss of life in a number of different train crashes Effectively in the government was forced to step in and take the infrastructure company Railtrack back into administration because it had gone bust Theres this huge and complex web of financial debate argument and blame and recrimination that goes round and round and round every week of every year under the privatised railway in this country and its a nonsense People were proud to be a railwayman Very very proud to be a railwayman There was a publicservice ethos which was passed on to new people who started in the industry Now what happened after privatisation is that a deliberate and concerted attempt has been made to erase that history within the railway workers So for example somebody recruited to work on the railway today isnt even taught to think of themselves as a railway worker Were losing an industry that we invented in this country and which people love and which young people need mean weve got a million young people unemployed in Britain today million young people unemployed They should be being employed some of them at least learning how lo do railway engineering skills railway operational skills to deliver the kind of services that this country needs in order to develop a new green public transport system In the market was liberalised Other companies could come in and collect mail from businesses who are posting it sort it then pass it on to Royal Mail to deliver What that has done is its undermined Royal Mails capacity to provide a universal service which is subsidised by business postings The cost of the universal service for everybody is no longer supported to that degree by what businesses do In simple terms people used to get their mail earlier Now they get it later They used to have two deliveries Now they get one per day The reform of the health service is of course to bring it back into the marketplace and degrade it back again into making healthcare a commodity So its not reform at all It started when Margaret Thatcher started contracting out domestics and porters and laundry services Again just the process of administering asking people to bid for contracts costs money in and of itself to write the contract for what you want rather than just have domestics doing the cleaning But then to win the contract you have to put the cheapest bid in So the ward worked on at the time we had two fulltime cleaners on in the morning and a parttime cleaner on in the evening When finished at the hospital they had a half a cleaner on in the morning and then one between about ten wards in the evening It wasnt cheaper when people get and infections which then might cost the whole of what youve saved on the contract on one person if theyre in intensive care mean there was a real feeling of ownership about the when it started People felt they were doing it themselves that it was their possession And theyve lost that So the cost of running the health service the admin cost was about six percent before that started Then they moved up to about percent Now theyre heading in the direction of American costs for running the health service anything between percent You can see the politicians have chosen to waste a huge amount of money on marketising the service ve got a big picture of Aneurin Bevan looked at every day think Where are the people And What he says is All the time the people have got the faith to fight for it Weve been out on the streets and people said Theyll never privatise the Why are you getting so up the wall They wont do that And people just didnt believe they would do it It seems to me theres a sort of blindness to the enormous advances that have been made in British medicine as a result of the mean there are many things that have taught the rest of the world so far as the was concerned This was a very inventive organisation with lots of new initiatives do hope we dont go down the American system whereby the first thing you met as you come in with broken legs or whatever is someone with a clipboard who says Are you insured When theres money there the private sector is happy to be there taking the cash thank you and paying its shareholders When the money isnt there as we saw locally after only a couple of years of involvement in primary care they were off People are ready to defend the National Health Service They do know about it They do know the rewards of it They do know about the care and the treatment they get Theyre all going there every day You can see it can see it more than ever ve got a lot to be thankful for and so has my wife on the National Health Service think it will happen think they will understand the situation on the That is the one institution from that needs to be defended Weve lost most of the others if not all the others but the National Health Service if they attack the right Tories Lib Dems attack the National Health Service if we dont understand that weve got to do everything up to and including breaking the law to defend the National Health Service then were finished We were defending a flawed project This is the worm in the apple of This wasnt workers control This wasnt popular engagement with the control This wasnt controlled from the base up There werent committees in every locality managing the council housing There werent shop stewards running the steel industry or the coal industry This was a set of state bureaucrats replacing a set of corporate bureaucrats Whereas socialists are talking about the transformation of the economy into a different type of economy thats not driven by the market but driven by the common needs of society think thats the big difference that were seeing If theres a need and theres no profit in it the need goes unanswered caring capitalism Miliband is talking about this socially responsible capitalism Its a bit like the Arabian phoenix isnt it Everyones heard about it Nobodys ever seen one We have to face up to the fact that again its the market Its the system that says that profit is the most important thing that makes the world go round that we have to that we have to take on Its a hard struggle but this system what we live under is absolutely rotten and corrupt as far as m concerned From top to bottom its rotten And the quicker it goes the better In the face of the failure of the right if you like the neoliberals and their assault on the public services their failure terrible financial global failure at the moment of the market we still are trying to make the case that actually we should go back to working together for the greater good And think the has been a terrific example of that as have many things in this country Education and the welfare state Whats so shocking is the people who are dismantling this at the moment are the people who grew up and benefited from that system The idea of socialism is weak in this country and the idea of capitalism is very strong Capitalism itself is not strong its falling apart but the idea of capitalism is very strong The paradox in the situation is that the ideas which come together and which have traditionally been called socialism exist in a sort of atomised way right across the political spectrum When you see the Occupy people say that they are anticapitalist antifree market the corollary of that is that youre in favour of some kind of planning even if thats not an articulated view They want some kind of democratic control over the economy Thai is the essence of the socialist idea whether or not you choose to call it socialist and whatever colour you paint it Well think we were hijacked The workingclass organisations were hijacked by the middle class Thats my opinion Especially the Labour Party The Labour Party was a workingclass organisation at one time In no way shape or form can you call the Labour Party a workingclass organisation any more The working class havent got any big organisations that can take the establishment on They dont realise that strength theyve got do they They dont realise that power theyve got The working class can change the whole history As quick as as quick as that They just dont realise They havent grasped it One day think the dream that those miners had underground before the war will become a reality We will be able to take real control of our own lives We will have a manufacturing industry The day when you see our kids walking the streets of Caerphilly and walking the streets of Abercynon years of age and theyve got their Es and theyve got their hands in their pockets and their head down and they seem as if theyve got no future and their eyes are dull think those days will one day come to an end coming out of the dream that those miners had so many years ago am absolutely convinced that the older generation rather than being a burden on society has got an absolute duty to come forward and join with young people and talk to them and explain say to pensioners turn off the television take their plugs out of their ears and start talking about what was the vision in What did we want How did we see it progressing What did it mean from the cradle to the grave What did it mean to have common ownership and for sharing and communities What does it mean Start to rebuild that understanding of what sort of life we want think weve got a real chance to do that Now friends this is the first time in the history of this country that a Labour movement with a socialist policy ask from you all support that we shall need to carry us through triumphantly through difficult years to the great era which is opening before us Blue skies around the corner Walk round the corner with me Just round the comer youll see Those blue skies Blue skies theres nothing wanner Wont you feel happy to be Sharing the sunshine with me Under those blue skies Trouble may come but troubles will go Dont you ever worry any more Look at those skies Theyre not telling Ya Thats what they were put there for Blue skies around the corner Everythings gonna be right never a cloud in those bright blue skies Without rhythm train could never go without rhythm troop could never roll without rhythm The day would never go because rhythm Is the thing that makes the world go round Without rhythm poet couldnt rhyme without rhythm Could never tell the time without rhythm Wouldnt hear the chime because rhythm Is the thing that makes the clock go round Without drums When we go strolling in the park at night All the darkness is a boon Who cam if were without a light They cant black out the moon see you smiling in the cigarette glow Though the picture fades too soon But see all want to know They cant black out the moon
