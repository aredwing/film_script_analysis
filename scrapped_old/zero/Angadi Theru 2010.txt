You blabbered last night. That's why I told her. No Kani, I didn't tell anything. -He came and told you as his wish. -Hey.. -You only told last night. -No Kani, I didn't tell anything. Kani, please listen. Listen. -what..? -Nothing sir! -Nothing sir! -what? -what? -Nothing! Do you know what is happening here? Sir ordered us to dismiss, if anybody misbehave with anyone.

Do you know why Selvarani has committed suicide? She didn't worry about the job and the boss. Soundarapandi has told that he didn't love her.. She lost her life when he said that. It was her body that has fallen down. I was worried about my family. That was true. -But..! -You have thought to leave me, right? Don't talk and get lost. If you stay here, I will beat you and kill you. Go..! Go away..! why do you yell out? I am asking you.. what is the sound..? -why are you shouting..? -Bandicoot sir! I have hit it.

Is nothingness erasing the love? My plight is killing me! How can you leave me alone? How will I survive, if you kill me with your word? what dear? Is there any test going on? when will it get over? -what test..? -The street dog used to do like this only. The female dog used to roam the streets. The male dog would chase and catch it. That is called love. You too are doing that, right? Are you playing? You only are playing. You're testing his love too much. I will take care of it! You go and do your work. I just informed you. You have too much of self-respect. I am behaving with dignity at least with this guy in this world. Buddy, I will take leave. I won't disturb you any more. I came here for you only. I didn't listen even my dad's words. You aren't talking with me. why should I be here? I will take leave. But one thing. Everytime I pray God I pray for your welfare!

Didn't those live in the streets? Come let's go. -Listen to me, Lingu! -Come let's go. why do you feel scared? You have thrown the stones on me.. Then, why are you be afraid? Come let's go! Oh gosh! Lingu..! If anybody see this.. -Call.. let them come. Call them. -Oh gosh! If they see us, It will be a big issue. -Go and call her too. -oh gosh! Please.. -whoever is it... -oh gosh! Oh gosh! -Go..! -why did you push me inside? why did you push me inside and have locked the door? You saved me because I shouldn't get caught. I too have the same thought. For that you named me as.. ..eunuch, coward and Soundarapandi. I didn't have any wealth to save you, if we get caught.. Your dad too didn't have any wealth to give.. ..Rs.1,00,000 as a gift money to the groom. what did you say..? You tried to leave me once, right? Are you a millionaire's daughter for that? That's why I have thought about your wealth. The people like us should think for our life long. I thought not to leave our families. was it wrong? I have loved the one who didn't even understand this. But now only I realiZe that it was wrong. You too like that Selvarani the one who died without understanding Soundarapandi If I follow you again, beat me with snapped slipper. -Did you talk with her? -Yes, I have. Superb, buddy.

No one told about this to me. -Tractor is the mode of transport -Yes, believe me. I have to go walking only. I was looking pretty in my childhood. Sofi, bags are looking good, isn't it? It is looking good but it won't give the life. -Sofi..! -what..? -Go, man! -oh gosh..! Sofi.. Hair piece, Sofi.. I bought this for you with great desire. That damn Anthony has disgraced me by pulling my hair. I didn't use the hair piece from that day. Nobody will present this type of things to the lovers. Go and think something new. Let me see afterwards. Something new..? New means.. Bring a greeting card, poem.. -Not a poem.. Donkey only will come.. -what..? I will write the poems too.. You go! I wouldn't come to Chennai and get the beat from my father.. ..If I knew to write the poems. Poem..! Sofia, oh gosh..! -Brother..! -Tell me! -I have searched you only.. -what?

Those days I have teased him as dirty mouth.. First, I have to go and ask the pardon from Jesus, tomorrow. See, he wrote very well. He wrote that like fire. I was stunned when I read that. You are like the sky and the earth.. You are like the wind and the light.. You are like the food and my soul.. -Kamalam, come here! -what..? we have read this poem somewhere, right? Like the sky, earth, wind and the light.. when we are in 9th standard we studied this as memory poem. He wrote Sofia here instead of the god. Yes..! I wondered about his intelligence. I was fooled by believing this as love poem. I will see him, tomorrow. You dirty mouth! I will finish off you. Let him come! I will take care him. Look there. Your poet looks agonized. Today, he will write 10th standard memory poem and give it to you. Tell me the result. You are going without caring me. Go you damn fellow. why are you behaving like this? Don't you get the rope to commit the suicide? You are the only person who gave the memory poem instead of a love letter. Nobody will love you even if you die. -Sofi..! -Go man..! I will write my own poem and give it to you. Go man! -Go I said. -I won't need your friendship! Leave me! Marimutthu Sofia. Lingu, get up! -Get up, man! -what..? She has come to meet you. -who..? -Kani only. She was staring. I don't know what is the problem. Go! what? Didn't I tell that my sister Nagamma is doing.. ..house keeping work in madhavaram? -Yes..! -Her madam called me and told. what happened? ..that she is not well. She asked me to take her immediately. She is suffering with fits even in her childhood days. I don't know what to do. I feel scared. Inform you are on leave and wait in T.Nagar bus stop. -I too will inform the leave and come. -ok! How old is your sister? 13 years old! I know why you are looking. You are asking why she goes for job at this young age. I didn't have mother. My father used to sell palm fruits in the temple street. He slipped and fell down when he climbed tree. Six months.. we sold our property and got loans.. ..and saved him. Lot of debts are over. My sister and me work here and repaying the loans. My father is on house arrest at my aunt's house. Debtors are not allowing him to go out from there. Madam..! -who is it? -I am Nagamma's sister. The dog is being tied. Come inside. Madam, what happened to my sister? -Didn't she inform you? -No..! She has become matured. Look..! There is lot of customs in my house. He is doing the prayers. I made your sister sit in the garden. Take her with you. Look..! Allow her to bath and do the customs and bring back here. I don't have any others to work in her place. Dear, Nagu.. Get up, Nagu. Sister..! -Sister..! -Nagu..! -Sister..! -Dear..! -Dear, Nagu.. -Sister..! Did you stay here for the whole night? She told not to come inside. Sinners! Are they human beings? Kani, let's go! Here, take this 50 rupees. No need, madam. Don't you want? Then go. I don't know where I should go and what to do.. Sister..! I made a matured girl to stand in the road. Sister, don't cry. Oh my God..! Don't cry, sister. I didn't allow her to walk and do the work when I am in my native. I don't know how I am going to conduct the ceremony. I am like a beggar that who doesn't have any relations.. Don't cry, sister. No need to celebrate the function, sister. Don't cry, Kani. To the temple..? She should not go to the temple. That is condemnable. Human beings only see the customs. God won't see that. -No Lingu.. -wait I will go and ask. My sister became matured. I don't know what to do. Don't worry! There are no restrictions in this temple. You go and ask her to come. Go..! Fall down on her feet and get the blessings. Be prosperous. Thanks a lot, madam. Don't cry, dear. She told that she didn't sleep the whole night. That's why she went to sleep very soon. Ok, I will take leave. what Ganesa..? I heard that your wife begot the child.
