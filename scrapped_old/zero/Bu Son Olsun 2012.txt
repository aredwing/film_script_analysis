Apo, everything set fortonight? All set. Don't worry. Let's set these down. - ls that all? - What the hell? Why couldn't you get more? We've been to 4 protests since morning. We're pooped out. Apublic service We're saving the forests. What's with the coins?! Show us some notes. Count 'em out Now that's more like it. Hand it over. l'll keep it safe Don't get yourhands dirty. Good luck! Come on, Cowboy. Get going. All the nights spent in front of yourhouse. # Barely escaping with my life when yourfathershowed up. How l've suffered formy love, abused by one and all. Don't pick on this poorwretch #...this shabby toad. # Don't chase away this pauper. lt's not red enough. Thanks brother We needed some thinner. Have a good one. Chicky-chicky, bah-bah. We ran out of booze again. Sleep overthere. Tomorrow's Friday. Let's do some shopping before wintercomes. Tatar, l sent my brother-in-law round yesterday. But you said there's no oil What gives? What's that supposed to mean! There's plenty of oil and gas forthose who pay, Mslman! l'll send my boy round this evening. But he'll pay in marks, not lira. What am l supposed to do with marks? Shame on you. You know l'll give you a good exchange rate. Hajji, what's your line of work? What on earth have we here? You'll stoop to anything but then you put on airs with us! My prayer beads! - Brother, can he keep them for a bit - Sure, sure. nallahe meassabirin... Shame on you! What'd he say? Allahuekber. Grab the boots What good are those? l got me a pairof money changershoes. Not bad, huh? Ali! Hey, Cowboy Ali! He's hung up on something again Go on, Yaar. We'll catch up. Okay, but don't dawdle. What are you looking at? - Where'd they write the reward? - What reward? Don't they give a reward to whoever catches them? Wanted: Cowboy Ali. $10,000. l'd be the first to turn you in if there was something like that. What would you do with dollars? We just made friends with a money changer. lf he couldn't remember me l'd show him his shoes. Come on. We still have to go to the market. Come on! ''Mara Massacre'' Hey, midget Cevat! Drop those cukes. Sit down We're going to play a game. lt's real simple. There are 2 red cards and a black one. l'm going to shuffle them Find the black one. lmbecile! Just pick one. Why botherwith you. What you looking at, artiste! Cowboy Ali Sideways. How many years has it been since you came to lstanbul to find... - ...Ylmaz Gney and be a movie star? - Eight. His costume's rotted on him. He came to find his fellow townsman but ended up finding me. That Gney's always making trouble. Like you aren't! When l got here he went to prison He got out only to go back in. He'll get out, don't worry Enough about him. You're good at sniffing out news Are there any protests tomorrow? There's nothing this week. But if someone gets shot there might be a small protest. There's no market tomorrow How are we going to eat? lt's time to take an interest in current events! Whose turn is it now? We dropped by Gltekin' s. They weren't in, so we went to Sinan's. Then tomorrow we go to Gltekin' s And Sinan's the next day. Who says politics doesn't fill your belly! Enjoyed it, brother Erturul? More? Since you insist, l'll have another, brother Rt. - ln the name of God.. - ln the name of God... You're not meeting with those degenerates are you? Who? You mean Sinan's group? We haven't seen them forweeks For all we know they're dead. lt's true, chief. l saw them leaving the mosque the otherday. Good for you So you've started doing your prayers. My head's glued to my prayerrug. l pray 8 or9 times a day. l do it 20, 25 times. They're making up fortime You know what it's like. You know betterthan me. Hmm, l see. Tell me you've given up wine too. Sure we have We only drink mare's milk. Rt, give me another one. Hey, get yourpaws off my soup! Thanks, sister. We haven't had a bite to eat for a week. lf you get hungry, come here. There's always a pot of soup. No money forfood, but you've got plenty forwine and fun. Some of our guys saw you the other night. Singing and carrying on by the waterfront. That's a big, fat lie. Yourfriends must have mixed us up with someone else. There are lots of winos like us in Balat. Could you get me some water? Wno's just a figure of speech lt's not like we can scrounge any. - Especially with these price hikes - Prices are breaking ourbacks. l don't get it. A bottle of wine was 43 lira last month. Now the same bottle's 48 lira Same bottle, same wine. lf there was more wine l wouldn't say anything. But why does that bastard grocerkeep hiking the price? Thanks. - lt's not the grocer's fault - lt's not? lt's not something he decides lt's government policies. See, Apo. You gave the groceran earful for nothing. We'll track down that ''gubmint'', whoeverthe pimp is. l wonderwhich mosques he goes to. - Ah, that explains the new shoes - From the doorstep. Don't do that again. lsn't stealing beneath you? You said you were going to take from the rich and give to the poor. We just got a head start to save you some of the trouble. Do you think thieving and revolution are one and the same? We aim to take power. Okay, you take power, and we'll take shoes. So you stole shoes Are your problems finished? You went hungry fora week Now your bellies are full. Winter's coming. You haven't even got a roof over your heads. You're right, Sinan. lf only we had a warm place to spend the winter. You soon will. Very soon. When we seize power all of yourproblems will be over. We're on the brink of revolution. All this talk about revolution Why won't he just let us stay here? What's that, Erturul? Revolution's the only way! Are you going to give us a house when the revolution happens? Not just you, Yaar. Everybody. There aren't enough houses in the whole country forthat. There's enough to go around for everyone. Could l have some more? Chief! Are you okay? Red Kit wannabe! Where'd those Muscovites go? My sixth sense tells me they took a left. You haven't got any sense, let alone a sixth one. What's with the moustache? What are you bums doing here at this hour? Where'd those anarchists go? The ones painting everything? Have you seen those troublemaking fascists? Where'd they go? Same thing every night, Yaar. We need some new excitement. REVOLUTlON'S THE ONLY WAY FASClSM You're up here like a night owl again. Why are... Why'd we come up here? Aren't you going to tell me? Something important. Look underthat loose brick overthere. Sinan, what's this? What happened to the paint? They almost used it up. l didn't feel like carrying it. l wish you had We'd have painted those boards. Did you look around? Some must be left. l swearthere wasn't any They painted the whole wall. Whatever. Sleep tight, Apo. You too. MAHlR lZ A FASHlS AL SCREWED HlM BUT GOOD. APO FROM BALA What're you doing! We're hungry. So what! Am l yourfather? l'm hungry too. But l was fast asleep. Go to Sinan's place and get some food. We were just there. We can't go again so soon. Sinan said, come anytime you're hungry. lt's shameful not to go. Halt! Go home There's a general curfew. Are you kidding me? You're saying we can't go out in the street? Haven't you heard? The government's been overthrown! What! Overthrown? There's been a revolution! Go home and don't make trouble. Are you serious! Arevolution? Allah! Yaar, Apo, Cevat... Get up. Sinan's group's done a revolution. Oh, get up, quick. Let's get to his place before anyone else We'll get all the best stuff. Don't worry, Yaar. They've a ready taken measures. There's a curfew. Come on! Wait for me! Didn't l always tell you. Sinan would be a great man? Look, they've got a whole squad here to protect him. There's a general curfew Haven't you heard the news? We heard. We've come to wish them the best. Best of luck... Are you out of your minds? Go home! l hope we... - We'd better go home - Where's our house? Let's go back. l'll explain. Best of luck to you. lf Sinan's group didn't do it, Gltekin' s did. Who else is there! Screw Gltekin. They couldn't herd sheep, let alone do a revolution. Hey, Apo! What do you mean talking about my brothers like that? We found stacks of magazines and newspapers. - lllegal materials? - Life, Show Biz... Anything about workers and peasants? No, but something about Blent Ersoy's sex change. - Take them in to headquarters - Yes, sir! We've learned that ''Apo from Balat'' and his comrades left home early. l wanted to write something too. Hey you! Apprehend them! Come here! Don't worry, it's us Jump in quick. Don't worry. We'll be in Greece tomorrow. Why should a fire be forbidden? Lighting one's like saying, 'Come and arrest us'. That's enough! Let's just get through the night. We'll see how things pan out tomorrow. Then we'll figure out what to do. Hey, get up! Stand up. Get up, get up. Round them up Have them form a line. What are you doing? Don't you know you're forbidden to go out on the street today? Commander, this is our home. We live on the street and eat what we can. Shut up! An order's an order You're not allowed on the street. Everyone's supposed to stay at home. lf you haven't got a home, find one or build one. You must have misunderstood We live on the street. This is ourhome, and since it's ourhome... What are you talking about? You some kind of troublemaker? What kind of home is this? A home has a roof, walls, windows and a door. ls a wall and a roof enough to make a home? Even without windows? Get yourselves a roof, then you can rig up the rest. Ok. See, l'm at home Here's a wall, there's a roof. l'm inside. l'm outside lnside, outside. Leader Of 12 May Coup Convicted ofTorture What's that! Amest those communists! But we're anti-communists. Anti or not, take them away. l wonderwhat happened to Erturul. He's saved his skin somehow Be sure of that. l was listening to Comrade Stalin on Warsaw radio once. He said, the nation's real problem is... ...a lack of shelterand food. Comrade, that's it in a nutshell. By lack of shelter, you mean no home. Lack of food, means no land to till. Right. l'm honored to be in the same boat with you, comrade. l'm sure comrade Asaf agrees with me. l do, comrade Cengiz. Ournew comrade's transformed this little fishing boat... ...into a revolutionary school. Just give me another cig and see all the things l'll tell you. Haven't you got American ones? l've been smoking Bafra all day lt's killing my lungs. - Whatever, l'll make do fornow - Did Stalin speak any Turkish? Left, left; left, right, left. What are we doing here? Pipe down. Keep marching! l said, left! Prison life's nothing like life on the outside. Watch what the others do and do the same. Strip so you can be searched. Human dignity will vanquish torture! Attack! They smashed us up good. We listened to you, Yaar, and look at us now. Things'll get better. They were going to beat us anyway. At least we kept ourclothes on At least we did that. Move along, move along. - Didn't they beat you? - No, why'd they beat you? They told us to strip. And you refused. Everything that's happened to us is because of you extremists. l'd rather be an extremist than run around bare-assed. Face forward. What's an 'extremist'? - Screw the whole lot of you... - Apo, calm down. Wow... this is great. lt's a palace. Amazing. Things turned out just fine We'll spend the winter here. We might stay even longer. We're here by mistake They'll realize in a few months. - lt's more complicated than that. - How's that? l confessed we were members of an illegal organization. As for you, Yaar, you'll get to stay longerthan us. Why's that? - They asked who my leaderwas - What'd you tell them? l couldn't say Cevat Of course l said you. We were depending on Sinan, but we ended up in a bed and breakfast. l'm hungry What time is lunch? Hey, what time's lunch? He asked you a question Answer him. Which faction are you with? We're called 'extremists' round these parts. Welcome extremists. - Ask Friar Kenan about mealtimes - Who's that? The cook? Ah, speak of the devil They were just asking about you. Tayfun, tell yourfriends to get up against the wall for a search. What's all this searching? Do you think you'll find gold? Tayfun, don't cause any trouble Sooner or later, you'll get searched. Don't you ever give up, Friar Kenan? Okay, bring it on! As you wish. Tell everyone to remove theirglasses. Director, do you want some biscuits with yourtea? No, now scram. Welcome, Commander, welcome Have a seat. Welcome. What are you looking at? Go get the Commandersome tea. l can't teach them a thing. Anything the matter? You look a little stressed. l'm fine, just fine. We haven't even been able to get the searches on track. The state put in heating so the prisoners wouldn't get cold. But they use it to communicate theirseparatist activities. l don't give them that much credit. But they don't realize who they're up against. Those impertinent idiots don't realize a thing. They'll realize soon enough! We've broken our billy clubs But we haven't broken them. l don't know what to say, Commander. You're absolutely right. The clubs break before you can break the skulls of those blockheads. Don't they realize they're damaging valuable state property? lf they cared we wouldn't need to be here, would we? Ah, l can't believe my ears. Without you, where would this nation and its people be? How many sugars, Commander? Three. lt's none of my business,... ...but you won't get anywhere by beating them. You can break in a donkey but you'll never break them in. - You've got to find anotherway - Like what? Beat them forthree days, and they'll beg formore on the fourth. And as forthe anarchists! They never get theirfill. So are we supposed to just fatten them up and neverbeat them? Not all of them. Just a few. l don't understand? What's there to understand? We need to identify the weak prisoners and separate them. lf we treat them nice, they'll feed us information. And when the others see how good they've got it... ...they'll come to us on their own and sit right in ourlaps. The legendary Captain Kenan will have... ...brought the prison to heel. The new Commanderof Penitentiaries: General Kenan. Ah, did l say 'general'? God must have made me say it. - Some biscuits with yourtea? - No thanks. - Maybe some crackers? - l'm good. Ah, remember Crazy dris? You're so gullible, zgr. - How could you have trusted him? - Well, l did. Tell us. What was dris' harebrained scheme this time? A real doozey. Hunting at the zoo. That's just like dris. What did you hunt? That was the problem. What are we supposed to hunt at the zoo? We decided on swans. Would you believe we used ourties as lassos? And? Ourties ended up on the necks of the swans. We were afraid the guards would see ourties. So we jumped into the lake to get ourties back. That's when they caught us. The worst thing is, they hadn't even noticed the ties. Ourextremists have turned out to be crybabies. lt's still early days, and they've already withdrawn into theirshells. What kind of extremists are you? You're more like a pussycat. Screw you. - Calm down, Apo - Watch yourstep. Let me go, Yaar. We came here to rest and look at how we're treated. Are you into pain orwhat? Are you a bunch of masochists? No, we're Stalinists. Everything is because of you. - Who do you think you are? - Cool it. What's it to you? Who put you in charge? lf l want, l'll let them search me lf l want, l'll bend right over. lt's up to you. Nobody's telling you what to do. But if you buckle after a beating ortwo how'll you live with yourself? lf we let them search us today they'll demand more tomorrow. This fascist junta won't stop at anything. So Erturul was right! The fascists are behind the revolution. Gltekin' s a junta What's a junta, anyway? l'll explain... Mix it up and make peace! Go on! What are you doing here, cousin? They said you were a junta. What are you talking about? They said the fascists did the revolution. We guessed it was you. Chief, how could you do a revolution and not tell us. You broke ourhearts, chief. Who'd have thought it, chief. Tell those soldiers to let us go There's been a mistake. Shut up, idiots... lf Sinan's group didn't do it, and neither did Gltekin' s... ...who did the revolution? We were promised a house Who's going to give it to us? You'd better go to the director He'll set you straight. - Give us money, not advice - Ora house. Watch your mouth! - Who are those weird ones? - Which ones, director? Those vagrants... Ah, them. They confessed they were with an organization. But you know what it's like these days. We jail someone forstealing bread, it turns out he's head of a faction. They've been hanging out fortwo months. - Their leader's the old one - That weasel-faced one. - Bring him to me - Yes, sir, director. Cigarette? Go on. lt's American. Here. Amemento of my father. So, are you happy here, Yaar Efendi? - As happy as ournation - Oh, good. What's wrong with our country? Everything's fine other than a handful of anarchists. They said you were an anarchist but l didn't believe it. l told the commanderthere must have been a mistake. They're not the type, l said But he wouldn't listen. lt breaks my heart to beat you along with those anarchists, day and night. l'm terrified you'll grow to like it like they have. Talk won't change a thing. You've got to prove yourself. Prove what? You've got to show yourdevotion to ournation and its people. - How are you going to show it? - How? Are you dense? Have you been listening? Do l have to spell it out? You'll cozy up to the anarchists in yourcell. Anarchists don't get cozy, but you'll find a way. Do it, and l'll make life easier for yourfriends too. You can work in the laundry and the kitchen. Hold on, l gave the kitchen to Glteki l'll fire him. What is it, Tom Mix Texas? Are they going to keep us here forever? What's the matter? Don't you like us? Where'd the pasha like to go? mral island would be nice. Ah, someone misses the sea air. Cowboy, if you want to see the sea,... ...turn yourface to the sky. lt looks just like the sea. What's up, Yaar? Why'd the director call for you? What does he want? Nothing. l've got a toy for you. We can write a petition. lf you can't write, dictate it to me. Really, Cihan? l can write, but a letterwould be too much for me. Sinan? Yaar, what are you guys doing here? You wouldn't believe me l wouldn't know where to begin. Things have got so weird l'd believe anything. Wow, look at me! Send Hzrin. - What are you doing, you scoundrel? - Director! You think you own the place? The chair broke, director l was fixing it. Don't even try it! Get out of here! Hi there. Hello, Cafer Bey. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Not so well - My condolences. What is it this time? l've got a pain. Right here Can l take this off? Go right ahead. Atightness just here And a warm tingling sensation. Right around my heart. You've got gas lt's perfectly normal. Drink some carbonate and you'll be fine. l feel betterwhen l see you. People often feel sick in hospitals and clinics. But if you need an examination, see the doctor. Try to understand, Nurse Nimet lt's you l'm sick for... Niyazi Bey's come. What is it, Nimet? Cafer Bey's not feeling well He wants to see you. - What is it? - lt's nothing to do with you! He's even crazierthan Director Hzr! God help him. - Are the reports ready? - Yes, sir. This won't do. What's this! Are you trying to ruin my retirement? - What's this? - What is it? ''Jaw broken as a result of a heavy blow.'' - How could you write that? - lt's true, isn't it? Soldiers are a bit heavy-handed You know that. But you went and wrote ''a blow''. Okay, l'll do it myself Orderme a tea. So, he was talking behind yourback... Enough about that. What's that bastard Hzr really up to? He's pulling a fast one. Rememberthose fourbums who came two month ago... Yeah? He's handed overthe prison to them. He's made the old one his aide. Has he lost his mind? How can you turn a prison overto the inmates? He's not crazy. Just between us, he's gone a little senile. He's ready forretirement. What this prison needs is a young, dynamic director... Come in! ls this a bad time? Come in, doctor Caferwas just leaving. See you later... Are you ready? What's he up to. ls Niyazi angling formy post? l was just getting to the heart of the matter. Damn it. ln he comes with a backgammon board. Fato Hanm? Get a load of that. l'lljust go play with myself then. Don't spit on the meat. Since we're not eating it l'll spit all l want. They get meat, we get potatoes. And he eats half of them. Don't eat them raw You'll get a stomach ache. lt looks great. Careful. What are you doing? Make sure mine's well done. And cut yourfingernails, would you? Go on, beat it Harder! What are you doing? He's gnawing potatoes like a rat. Go on, eat up. l've got a headache. We haven't had a drop of wine for months now. What are you doing? Why are you wasting soap? l'm not wasting it. l'm transforming one substance into another. Ah, good for you. Look, l'm making these. Are you an inventor? No, l'm just trying to turn things into something else. Let me ask you something. l'm wondering how to change something into something else. How do they change grapes into wine? We use to drink all the time l always wondered about it. You gather grapes, then you crush them... Who everheard of such a thing! Making wine in prison! lf they'd managed it wouldn't be so bad. But wasting all those grapes? ldiots! Director! The commanderwants to see you. See? Now we're done for l'm not through with you lot yet. Niyazi, grab the backgammon board lt might mellow him. Come on, Cafer! Have you got something forasthma? First you have to see the prison doctor. Then it has to be approved by the director and the commander. That Doctor? Hide them. lf you get caught, don't mention me. Thanks. Thanks a lot. All we did was chase aftera couple of students. Now they're going to hang me. lf only we'd shot the prosecutor. Don't say that, chief. What'll we do without you? He's right, chief. You're all grown up. You'll look after yourselves. Take care of this big lug l entrust him to you. - Chief! - Cut it out... Don't leave me! Hey, stop it! Let me go! - Stop it, chief - Calm down. Let me go! You big cub! Just look at him. A brute of a man. But know yourown strength. Maybe they won't hang you lt could be a fake out. They hung some lefties, so now they have to say they're... ...hanging someone from ourside too. You know what? That's the first smart thing you eversaid. They're going to screw me over just to make things look fair. Come in. Commander, have you got a minute? Of course, come in. l've got a great idea. Guess what l found in the storeroom? Bailiff! Bring in the suspect. Why am l always the bailiff? Why can't Niyazi do it foronce! Bring him in... ldiot! That's not the way to do it. l wrote it down forhim. Gltekin, son of Hikmet... Prosecutor, read the indictment. Even though a full moon visible to the naked eye was... ... spotted last night, on the 20th of the month, suspect... ...Gltekin Akncbey failed to execute his duty... ...thus betraying his cause and fellow Grey Wolves. And what was his duty? Not only did he fail to howl at the moon, he snored all night. Why didn't you howl? Didn't we tell you to do what you're told? You heard the prosecutor Speak now orforever hold your peace. Naturally, you're speechless After all that talk of nation and honor. Then you shirk yourduty Ah, what's our country coming to? The court has decided. According to article 146/1, the defendant is found guilty of... ...the crime of inciting the overthrow... ...of the constitutional order... ...and condemned to death. What kind of court is this? What's going on? You're in luck. The ruling's been overturned by a peels court. A peels court? Wasn't it peels? Hold on lt's on the tip of my tongue. - Now what was it, Cafer? - Appeals. Appeals. Ah, it's been appealed Lower him. You got off, you scoundrel. Now stand on one leg and sing the national anthem backwards. Yes, sir. Yes, sir You're right, sir We might beat them, but we don't kill them. Well, not most of the time, sir. Sir? We're not overdoing it. What are three orfour? They keep dying on us. Well said, commander These anarchists can't take a joke. They die right on the spot. We'll be more careful, sir. Thank you, sir. lt's good to know you've got ourbacks. Good day, sir. The reports. The autopsies. l need to say Niyazi right away. Hzr... Hzr Pasha. My condolences. Nobody's long of this world. And neitherwas Tayfun. He hanged himself in his cell last night. May God have mercy on him. Shut the door. Mobs have attacked Greek neighborhoods, homes and churches... ...lynching local Greeks and looting theirbusinesses. Long live the revolution! The otherday l saw Lale in the clinic. - How was she? - The same as our country. Don't worry Lale's a strong girl. lt might sting a bit. Were you about to say something? How's Sinan? l have no idea how she's doing on the otherside of that wall. Just two months ago, they killed Tayfun. lf l could see herjust once. lf she could just me tell she was well. l can't do that l can't bring you together. Believe me, l wish l could But my hands are tied here. l know how you feel l know only too well. l was about your age. My fatherwas a huge admirer of PM Menderes. He really believed that the streets of lstanbul were paved with gold. So he sent me to lstanbul to learn a trade. He planned to help me start a business one day. Just before l left, he arranged forme to get engaged... ...with the daughterof a family friend. l had a lot of suitors back then They showed up every day. But l didn't fall in love with any of them. When a small town boy like me saw the lights of Pera... ...all my father's plans were forgotten. l went out to a different tavern every day. One night l ended up at Yorgo's tavern. That's the night l met the woman who would change my life. Luksandra. They brought Koray to the hospital He'd been hit in the head. He spent the night in intensive care. l tended him all night long. lt was love at first sight. Like the world was turn just forthe two of us. At least for a while. He nevercompromised his beliefs. Even if he was less active, he continued to help his friends. l got a telegraph one day. My fatherwas on death's door. l went straight home. l thought he'd get better, soften, and give his blessings... ... for me to marry Luksandra. lt was 1955, September. l heard the news... lt was 12 March... As he was escaping,... ...the police shot him in the back. They'd burned down Luksandra's shop, and her house. The last time l saw him was... ...in the morgue of the hospital where l worked. l spent weeks trying to find her Then l went back home. This time my fatherwas in his grave. His dying wish was that l stay at home... ...make peace with my fiance and get married. l wanted to honor his wishes l really did. But l couldn't. l couldn't marry another man while l was still mourning... ...the man l loved, just to please my father. l couldn't. l was burn with rage. Because... The ember burns where it lands. Nobody understood my suffering. They thought l'd forget him. But it still hurts and l've neverforgotten him. l ended up in the streets. For years, l had fantasies of seeing her again. Finally, l realized something. The six months we'd spent togetherwere worth a lifetime. Knowing, orat least hoping, that she was alive and well... ...even if she was far away, made life worthwhile for me. l really wish l could help you. But how can l? At least you know where the otherone is. All that separates you is a wall. Write Lale a letter. What if l did? The wardens won't give it to her. You're not going to give it to the wardens. Life's like water, Sinan. lt flows and flows. And as it does, people talk of 'fate ''when they encounter... ...the unexpected. lf life's a river, fate is water. There's no damming it lt always finds its way. The water also knows how to tear down dams. Having a good chat, are you? What are you up to, Sinan? Saving the country again? Hold it. lt's time we put out the fire. The ones who started it. Huh? Are you talking in code? Are you going to try to burn down the prison? Look at you. What's this? Where's the map? - l burned it, chief - Calm down, chief. To light the stove. l've got a good sense of direction Just like my sixth sense. - Let's wait a while longer - Let' wait. lf they don't hang Chief within five months orso... ...they'll let us out anyway. We've served our nation well. They wouldn't hang us lf you ask me. Anyway, if they hang anyone it'll be Chief. Come. Where's the acid? l cleaned the toilet with it. Alright, calm down! What are you doing, wolf cubs? We're counting heads. This time, chief's truly pissed off. Stretch it tighter, soldier. Don't forget, the nation depends on you. - Good for you, son - Thank you, commander. Oops, l dropped it. Friar Kenan's at his wit's end First pipe duty, now sheet duty. Send the messengermouse off. l hope he doesn't mobilize the whole army to follow the mouse. What are we going to do with the earth we dig up? We'll give it to the landless peasants. What can we do? We'll shake it from ourcuffs in the exercise yard. So, Yaar Efendi? l thought we'd become such good friends. You only visit me when l ask for you. l've taken offence. So tell me, what are our good-for-nothings up to? Nothing much There's been no change. What do you expect from anarchists? All theirtalk of change, but they never change at all. l don't know to put this the problem isn't the cellblock. What is it then? l'm not sure l should mention this l don't want to come between you. Has somebody got their eyes on my position? lt's Cafer, isn't it? l wouldn't put anything past that bastard. - No, it's not Cafer - Who is it then? - Niyazi - Niyazi? l was playing backgammon with Niyazi the otherday. Kenan came and said something about making Niyazi director. l might have misunderstood Maybe he meant something else. - l'm done for, done for. - Calm down. There's no need to panic. What do you mean? Let's install Cevat in the infirmary He'll keep an eye on Niyazi. Wait a second. Which Cevat? That midget, idiot friend of yours? He's as cunning as they come He knows how to play the idiot. Really? Fine then. Cevat, hand me those gauze bandages. Not that, gauze. Cevat, gauze. What's that? Give it to me. Who gave you this? Now give me those bandages. Reis, heads up! Calm down. - Should we go left, orright? - Right, of course, chief. We tried the otherside too. Then we'll dig towards Malta. lt's taken us six months. lf we dig towards Malta it'll take at least another year. We're getting out of here one way or another. Whetherit takes one year orfive. #When I lie in my bunk at night l imagine moments that might have been. I dream of the things we were neverable to do and may neverbe able to do. Forinstance, we neverwent to the cinema. There were neverdays in which we walked hand-in-hand,... ...not caring that we were getting soaked in the rain. We were always either on the run or hurrying to get somewhere. We neverhad a moment just forus. Hand-in-hand, l wish you and I wandered aII across the city too,... ...into strange new pIaces. How couId l not have wanted that? We'd have tossed bread to the seaguIIs orsung songs together. But sweetheart, my darling, now's the time forpatience. It's no time to think about such things, to daydream about what might have been. It's time to focus on the here and now. We might neversee each other again... ...but we share a common dream that will bind us forever. That's why we'll nevertruly be apart. Come on, boys. We're almost there. Cowboy, yourletter's been returned. Gney's escaped. lf l don't escape through that hole l found, my name's not Cowboy Ali. ln the men's and the women's wards, they're digging tunnels everywhere! They're like a bunch of moles. The prison will end up collapsing on our heads. Good for you. You finally did some good. That bastard Kenan's not around, so this is my chance. Cafer! No, he can't be trusted. Who can? The staff sergeant? So, Cafer. l see you're back. - Yes, director - Don't ''director'' me! - From now on, you'll call me ''pasha'' - Pasha? Gatherall the prisoners in the courtyard. - Pasha? - What? l don't want to interfere, but the most secure place is the kitchen. The most secure spot, huh? What happened to you today? Yourbrain's working overtime. Once we get past this l promise to make you my deputy. Gatherall the prisoners in the kitchen. Soldiers, go to the courtyard Go on, hurry! - Shall we inform the captain? - There's no need. The rest of you, go straight to the wards. March! Get going. Who needs the captain? The pasha's in charge Hzr Pasha. Everyone out in the corridor We're doing a search. Come on everyone, let's go Let them search in peace. When l'm done here, Sinan, l'm going to meet with you in private. We'll meet. We'll all meet one day forthe last time. Move it! Hurry up! Sinan. Glteki l'm terribly hurt. You broke my heart. lf we hadn't noticed, you were all going to leave on me. How could you leave without saying goodbye to yourpasha? Today was our kismet. Don't worry, Sinan. We've still got a lot of unfinished business. - Come on, Cafer - Coming, Director. You lowlifes! Are you the ones who squealed on us? Watch yourmouth,jackal You're the squealers. Hey, cut it out! What are you doing? What are you doing? You're going to ruin everything. Cevat, go on. Run. What the hell have we here! Hurry up and do this before Hzrcomes back. Move along. Go on. Step on it. Yaar, aren't you coming? l don't want to miss the expression on Hzr's face. You bunch of worms ls that all the digging you managed? Hzr, you got back just in time. We just ran out of cigarettes. Pull out some of those American smokes and give us a puff. - Director! - Start searching! Get out! Get them out of here! You're really asking for it. So, Hzr, did you find the tunnels? Just wait. You'll see what l found. l'll tell you what you found What you did... What did l do? l did you nothing but good. l turned this place into a paradise for you. One man's paradise is anotherman's hell, Hzr. That's right, it's been paradise forme. But it's been hell forthe others. Many years ago l saw the darkness and the hell that is this place. l know only too well how people like you can make life hell. Just you wait... l'll show you what hell can be! lt's always darkest just before dawn. l'll show you the dawn Here's yourdawn! You can't do a thing. How are you going to explain that yourown aide, me,... ...was behind that tunnel, and that you led the prisoners right to it? How are you going to explain that? You see, Hzr Efendi, sooner or laterthe day of reckoning comes. Yaar, we're dying of hunger. Everything's ready. Prison Fugitives Killed During Capture Magnificent Turk Erturul Named Businessman ofThe Year ln Germany May it never happen again Let's drink to Sinan! #You're very young, my dear Life is full of hope and joy #You're promised happiness forthe rest of yourlife #May you never be saddened by loneliness and lies At birth, people cry May it neverhappen again
