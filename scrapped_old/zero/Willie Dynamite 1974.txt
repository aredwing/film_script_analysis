Baby, are you runnin' these chicks or not? Now, I told you to keep an eye on her! Damn, Willie! I ain't got but two pair of everything. What you want me to do? I thought you want what I wanted. Honey, you know- Now, we got something together or not? You know it, Willie. Maybe you're gettin' too old for the responsibility... of bein' my bottom lady; maybe it's too heavy. Oh, oh, Willie. Oh, shit. You know that ain't it. Then what's happenin'? - Where is the bitch? - I'll get her. I'll get her. Where've you been? Get your ass in there before Willie breaks somethin'. This ain't shit!

I got this down, baby. Seven girls out there. Every 10 minutes, one comes off the production line. Like that. Dig it? Willie! Ten minutes! Dig it? This is a business, baby. A production line. And just like G.M., Ford, Chrysler... Willie's comin' through. These threads. Hmm? Silk. Satin. Why? Because Willie's sellin' an idea. You makin' these chumps believe they're gettin' the thrill of their lives. You're not only burnin' the chump's body, you're settin' fire to his brain. He's in the big town, on big business. You gotta make him feel like he's ballin' the Statue of Liberty. Remember the dream that you and Willie's got. This ain't gonna take us where we want to go. Remember... I ain't playin'. This may be the number two spot in the entire city, but dig it. I aim to be number one. Later. First, bring me some scratch. That's the seventh. Virtue C to Applejack. Bill Daddy. Hey, Bill. Hey, huh? Yeah, my bitch? She's on her way back to the house. Willie, yeah! Hey, man! How ya doin', baby? What's goin'on? What's happenin'? Go on. It's the best. Try this. Give me the rest of the money, woman. Oh, that hurts so good, man! That's the shit you remember when you forget everything else! I'm cool. Whoo! But I don't know how you do it! Don't know how you do it, man. I mean, dudes gettin'burned everywhere today. I mean, since the hearing, cops want double sugar. Why, you can't find an honest one for shit! Oh, man. And the bitches. Ooh, man! Them bitches is so freaky, they don't know what they want to do next! I mean, look. Two-tone Afros and- and leather jump suits. Hey, you know what one of them bitches said to me? She said, " Ah, would you pay for my silicone?" Shit! I don't know what they want from me, man! I feed 'em and I clothe 'em and I rejuvenate 'em! - That's inflation, baby! - Yeah! You jiver! Trouble is them pussies you runnin',Jack. Hey, they get any older, you're gonna be takin' down their social security. Hey, now, do I have to stand around here... and listen to them insulting my wives? I want to deal with a bigger insult, man. The heat. It's comin' down hard. We got to get our shit together! Now, we always been loose. Dealin' off the turf like it was never gonna run dry. That ain't no business. No other game is run so disorganized. Look around. Everything that is taking care of business is together, dig it? Tight! And together. - Except us. - Right. And now we're feelin' the heat. And the action's gonna get scarce and the turf is gonna get hard. What're you sayin', Bell? Now, we've seen these times before. - Never so heavy as now. - Well, I don't see any other way other than to ride it out. There is a way. We organize. Each of us gets his own turf. That way,you can cool all those strange freelance bitches. And when the heat comes down, all you do is cool it for a while. Meanwhile, business is still goin' on elsewhere, dig? Which takes care of you. The johns don't panic... and we don't jam up on each other. How's it sit with you, Cyrus? - I'm with you, Bell. - Top? Milky Way? Sugar? Sweet. Baylor? Yeah. Willie? I can dig it. The idea's fine. But, one thing. Who's gonna do the dividin'? Willie. Willie. The organization votes. Man, I thought we was all capitalists. Free enterprise, you dig? Now, this organization would kind of close that off. I mean, in all respect to your idea, Bell. Some dudes got big stables. Does that mean they get more turf? The organization will see that everyone is satisfied. Then there's another problem. - My bitches. - You sayin' you can't control your bitches? What I'm sayin' is... they deserve any area they can control. Well, I respect your ambition, Willie, but you got to have vision. Now, I run every kind of bitch, every kind of place, and I know one thing- When it comes down on you, you either collectivize... or you run... like a solitary rat. Maybe. Let me lay it on you, Willie. Alone,you always gonna have to take the risk... your bitches will be pulled, the man will never put his hand in. You'll be crowded and jammed up from every turn. I like the competition. And I can deal with any heat. Also, you dig, the bitches I run are selected to win. I mean, I'm controllin' some tough, aggressive, mean-lookin' animals. Now, can I tell them that they can only run in one part of the jungle? I gotta split. Be cool, men. Hey, what is it, Willie? Hey, what's happenin', fellas? Y'all got it. What's happenin', man? Hey, damn! Gotta get me one of them. Then you better start stealin' your mama's milk money. All right, then! Hey, Willie, I saved your spot for you. Yeah, hey. You be extra careful watchin' it tonight. Anyone come messin' with it, you tell Willie. Shit. Hello? Willie? It's Pashen. She's been busted. Damn! When? Hour ago. Okay. Yeah, shit. I'll be right down. Okay, okay. You just sit tight. Just stay out there and keep doin' business. Okay. They towed it, Willie! The cops come and towed it away. And it's not even a tow-away zone. And I was watchin' and lookin' and it was sittin' right here - Shit! Just lookin', and it went right on away. And I don't know what happened to it, but all I know is it left. Police Pier. Let's swing to more rhythm and blues on the early morning music station. Have a good day, huh? Oh, my God. What are you doin'? Come on. Come on, now. It's time for the most beautiful assistant D.A. in the city of New York... to get his ass out of the sack. No. Damn it, Cora! You are merciless! Ten lousy more minutes. Nope. No, no. I want you to get back to your apartment... so you can shower and shave... Yeah. and spray on some sexy deodorant... and then start paintin' them double-breasted pin stripes... all over your fine black body. Why don't you move in with me, hmm? What? Live in sin? So you can get 10 more minutes of sleep? All right. Let's play another game. It's called, um, "Let's Get Married. " And then move in with me. Oh, sure, Bob. Anything you say. Can't you see me being introduced to your father? Hmm. The first black supreme court judge of Philadelphia. "How'd you meet her, son?" "Well, uh, uh, Dad, um, "she was up on two counts of possession and loitering for the purposes of prostitution... and I was prosecuting her. " Come on, Cora. You were also a model before you decided to save the world. Listen, I'm not tryin' to save the world. I'm just tryin' to help a few girls. Mm-hmm. - How about helping me? - Try and understand this. Right now, I'm believable. I mean, they know I've been through everything they've been through. The streets, the pimps, the whole number. Married to you, I'm fuzz. I'm just another social worker trying to reform the world from 9:00 to 5:00. You can understand that. Right now, all I can understand is this. Come on, Bob. Come on. Come on, now. Stop it. Are you crazy? Mm-mmm. I said, stop it. Mmm, baby. Stop it now! Stop! Hello there, baby. How ya doin', Connie? It's doin'. What can I tell ya? I can dig it. Hey. What you into, honey? Coke? Meth? Skag? You don't see no holes in me. No, not yet. What are you, a cop? No. I'm not a cop. One of them social workers come to rehabilitate my nasty ass? Well, I got someone to take care of me. You watch your own ass. Well, unless he gets here real soon, you're gonna be inside the Women's House of Detention for a spell. And they just love 'em young and pretty in there. You're gonna be very popular. You're so young, and you'll have so many girlfriends to keep you company. All right, girls. Ah, it's gettin' late. What happens now? You'll be arraigned. If no one's out there to post bond, you'll go inside until your trial. Maybe you'll stay six months, maybe you'll stay longer. Listen, bitch, what is your game? Game? I'm not into any game. You want action? I can get it for you. No splits with anyone. What you mean? You're young. You've got style. You could model. You mean, sell my body and pay taxes on it? Listen to me! You're gettin' a choice! You're clean! You could have a real life without busts and horror-show johns. There're no strings. I can keep you goin' until you get settled. If you need help, you call me. If I can help, fine. If I can't, I will find someone who can. Now, that's the whole deal. You think about it. Maybe you'll have the time. ...with these any day. I must be doin'somethin' wrong with these boobies. I'll be outside... just in case no one shows up. Four seven nine seven three. Violation of Article 240... of the Criminal Code of the State of New York. Loitering with intent to commit prostitution. How do you plead? Your Honor, I plead- That depends. Just a moment. - How do you plead? - That depends, Your Honor. - What? - This isn't her first offense, is it? No, sir. The accused has been convicted 43 times. Is she represented by counsel? I can't afford no counsel. What do you think I should do? I beg your pardon? I ain't got no money for no bail or nothin' like them other times. I'm freelancin' now. Well, I can't spend any more time on this case. Either you will enter a plea immediately, or I will hold you in contempt. Guilty. What was that? That was " Guilty," Your Honor. All right. You may strike the rest. Let me see the record. In the light of the defendant's past record, I can only marvel at her incredible stamina. $250 dollars and five days. All y'all can kiss my big black ass- Get that woman out of here before I cite her for contempt! One seven eight six four. Violation of Article 240 of the Criminal Code of the State of New York. Loitering with intent to commit prostitution. How do you plead? - Psst. - Is the accused represented? May I have permission to speak to Your Honor in the accused's behalf? All right, Miss Williams. You have permission. Your Honor. I have been informed that this is a first offense. Therefore, on the entering of a plea of" Guilty," I shall parole the accused... into the custody of Miss Williams for the period of one year. What is the plea? - One moment, Your Honor! Ah, Your Honor, I represent the accused. I am entering a plea of" Not Guilty. " - So says the accused? - Yes. Very well. This case will be held over to Part Five. Bail is set in the amount of $2,000. Ah, thank you, Your Honor. Oh, my God, Willie. I never would have - I thought I was gone for sure. Oh, Willie, I was so scared! Oh, Willie. It's okay, baby. You're cool. Do what you want. I give you your release. You're free. Lookin' for work? What does a pimp know about work? Hmm? Ouch! Right in the heart with a silver bullet. Oh! That's round one. Who do I score it to? You ain't seen nothin' yet. She cost you 2,000 bucks! Figure it out. She was busted at 1:30. That's prime time. Now, you gotta make that production up. And I gotta add it to the overhead! They were just there, Willie. It never happened to me before. - Where were you? - In the prone position, where I was supposed to be. I ain't no baby-sitter. Besides, weren't supposed to be no cops there. I'll take care of that, bitch! You just do your job. What am I runnin' here? I give you prime protected territory! I set you down in a gold mine and you blow it! You put heat in that hotel and you'll be back walkin' 8th Avenue for nickels. See this? This is what you put your heads into. That's all. This is the jive-ass fantasy these clucks spend their lives droolin' over. Study the way they do their number and you got the edge. Was my man here with the clothes? Let's see it. Who are you? I ain't the Avon lady, honey. Honey! Ah, cool it. Cool it. I'm not a cop. - Well, who are you? Tell it quick. - I'm a friend of Pashen's. No, she was at the court. I told you, I'm not a cop! Uhh! Okay, now. Now, why doesn't everybody sit? Ladies? I said, sit! Hey, watch it! That's a $40 bag! You must be jokin'. It's worth 20. - How much? - Twelve a cap. Six on 4th and Columbus. How much you pay for that? Hmm? Don't tell her nothin'. Why not? Willie's man sold it to us at cost. Forty-five bills. I got one like it last year for 22.50. And the wig? Thirty-five. 9.50, Gimbles. Check it out. What are you tryin' to prove? Nothin', except you are the saddest ripped-off bitches I have ever known. Get it together! I mean, you wear out your back. You bring in the bread. You feed Willie, dress him like a king. He's wearin' mink, and you get rabbit. He gets more than 90 percent to protect you, but he can't keep the heat away from himself. You are bein' ripped off on everything. Now, baby, I mean, do what you wanna do. I'm no preacher. But do it for yourselves! Organize! You don't need Willie. Didn't you know? We liberated now! Maybe we should form a union. - And why not? - We're not $10 prossies. Our man is number one in New York. Well, you face it, Honey. He may be number one, but, to him, you will always be... number two. We must all get together... and do this again... sometime. Come on, Willie. Let's go. Move it. Get out. Come on. Get over there. Get up against the car. Spread the legs! All right. Get in the car, Willie! Take that car down to the precinct. Get in! Hey! Hey,you want a lawsuit? - Name? - I want to know the charge. - Name? - I want to call my lawyer. - Name? - I was not advised of my right to keep silent. Name? I was not advised of my right to counsel. - Name? - This is unconstitutional. I demand to know the charge- Now then, give us 10. I'll give you 20. Name! Spell it! W- I-L-L-I-E. D- Y-N... A- M-I-T... E- E-E-E! - The charge? - Suspicion of armed robbery. Armed robbery? It's a felony. $100 from a Puerto Rican grocer. $100? Have you flipped or somethin'? $100? - You fit the description. - I fit the description? A man in a brown coat. A brown coat? This is lamb! I paid over a grand for it! Okay, he's been booked. He's in the bull pen. Call me when you're ready. You read the paper? There's an article here on the Muslims. What do you want, Celli? Me? All I want to do is retire. I'm thinkin' about you. Naturally. What is it? Are you Orthodox or what? Or what? Well, what I mean is that, according to this... you're either gonna have to leave the force or be- Excommunicated? Is that what you're talkin' about? Tell me, Celli. You're a good Catholic. You know, turn the other cheek, do unto others. All men are brothers. All that stuff. Well- When are they gonna excommunicate you? We're ready for you. Do you think this new evidence will have enough bearing on the case? All right. Turn right. Lamb! This is lamb! It was parked in front of the precinct. It's a tow-away zone. Shit. How's tricks, Willie? I hope you got a warrant, 'cause what you're doin' is unconstitutional. C'mon, now. Don't get excited, Willie. You know we can search if we got a reasonable suspicion... that you're carrying something that could get you into trouble. You had my car towed here? Then you made the search? How's that gonna look? I want to call my lawyer. Up! Get 'em up! Spread and lean! Don't forget to measure my inseam. Ooh. Hey, go easy on Willie. He's tender. You know, he works with women all day. You know how it is. The ones you can eat with a spoon. Hey, come on. Take it easy. Take it easy. Willie's got to answer some questions. We don't want to harm his sexy voice. Okay, Willie. You recognize her? She O.D.'d last night. You killed her. Scum. Not my style. You hooked her good and used her. Then you dropped her for the stable you got now. Never hooked her on anything. Am I responsible for what happens when they leave me? I told you. Not Willie's style. I operate with class. You used her! Body, mind and soul! Pimp! And left a dead hulk where a woman used to be. Why all the concern over a used-up junkie? She your sister? Yeah, Willie. She's my sister. She's your sister too. What do you want, cops? All I wanna do is retire! What's this heat gonna cost me? What did you have in mind? Charge me. Nothing. It's all right, son. "Son"? Watch it. That's slander. Now, that's search without a warrant, unlawful detention, false arrest, threat and use of force, police brutality... and I'm a minority group. Wait'll I call the N.A.A.C.P. That Willie's a clever boy, Pointer. Son of a bitch memorized every one of those statutes. I just watch Ironside. It's Pashen. They busted her again. When? She wasn't even workin'! She went down for cigarettes and theyjust took her off the street. They busted the bitch again. Get her out. I don't care if it is Saturday. Get her out! How much? Why, you son of a bitch! I ought to report you to the Bar Association. Willie, some of the girls are worried. They saw cops in the building. Nobody worries. There's nothin' to worry about. Did you ever have to sweat the cops? Not only cops, but there was a woman here. What woman? She said she was a friend of Pashen's. I don't know if she was a cop or someone else. But she told the girls they were bein' ripped off, they were payin' over on everything... and the split was too small. You get the girls to work. I'll be there later, same as always. And I'll crack the first one who panics. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let him in. Then call the police. Listen here, bitch! Mr. Dynamite. Surprise. I catch you messin' around with my women, I'll cut you down. Oh, you have such a charming way of rapping. What kind of shit is this, anyway? Just say I'm a kind of a consumer protection agency. A sort of a Ralph Nader for hookers. So you listen to me, Mr. Willie Dynamite. I'm declarin' war on you. You dig it? I'm gonna make you number one minus one, which equals zero. Now, you got 30 seconds to get out of here. Bullshit. You got the police on the line? - Mm-hmm. - Good. Tell them he's armed and preparin' to rape us. Rape you? You think the cops'll buy that? I'd rather rape a watermelon. Ten seconds and I start screamin'. You on notice, bitch. Dig it? Notice. I met her in here about a year ago. Now, she's makin' 20,000 a year. It's nice. I can make five times that. I know. She's up for her first movie. It's funny. What's funny? I think you're prettier. Ooh, that's a nice ring. Who gave that to you? Willie. When you have somethin' with a man, you don't play. Twenty grand a year? We can make that in one month! We produce! Like that! Every 10 minutes, you dig? When you are out there- I mean, really out there, your head is on top, flyin'. Maybe five hundred bills of leather on my body. And being dug. I mean, really dug! I swear to you, I feel like I'm somethin' else! Somethin' no $10 flatback ho ever dreams of. I'm somethin' else, dig it? You can't touch it. And when they touch you, how do you handle that, hmm? I can make it. It's just getting past that one second. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, you can make it. Ain't nothin' to it, right? How would you know? How would you know anything? Listen, I had somethin' bigger and worse to carry around than Willie. I had somethin' to feed in me makes Willie look like a gospel singin' angel. My guts were on fire, 24 hours a day. I sold everything I owned, everyone I knew, loved, ever cared for. I mean, there was nothin' I wouldn't sell. There was nothin' I wouldn't do for that. Leave me alone. Yeah, sure. I'll leave you alone! I'll leave you all alone. Say, you got a smoke? Oh, you ain't stuff. You just a ho... like the rest of us in here. I'll leave the magazine... just in case you want something to read. Willie! Hey. You got trouble. Aunt Emma is inside, along with Uncle Ford. Uh-oh. I got trouble. Time to face the dinosaurs. Mama! Willie brought you somethin'. Well, say somethin'. Oh, it's a beauty. Mama, give Willie a kiss for it. That boy don't need no kisses from me. Well, aren't you gonna try it on, Mama? I'll try it on later. Now, will you finish so we can all get to dinner? A man in Willie's position should be donatin' 10 percent of his incomes to the church. Charity is a commandment of the Lord. What the Lord want with Willie's money? He's got all those rich white folks to get to first. You can't be neglectin' the church and be doin' right. Ambition can destroy a man. Bear witness. Bein'in business for yourself ain't easy. Things ain't always steady, are they, Willie? Steady? No. Up and down. Oh, my goodness! Oh, really? Didn't you say something about an album they was recording? An album? Oh, sure. The album. As their agent, you get 10 percent? Then you should give 10 percent to the Lord. Well, I for one would like to see them in action. Ooh ooh Willie, do they ever do benefits? Ah- Well, I'm sure they perform every chance they get. Don't they, Willie? They better. Who is it? Room service. We didn't order anything. Compliments of the manager, sir. Oh, did you see that? Exposing himself right out here in the hall! Put me down! Some say his business is cold and a crime Willie D. Willie D. He's operating to cop your mind - Good morning, Willie. - W illie D. Willie D. Silk and satin if you pay his price Yeah, Willie He'll set you up in his little paradise How can you lose Morning, Willie. The streets are so alive With so much sadness He's got to survive Willie Oh, Willie D. Oh, Willie Willie Oh, Willie D. Willie Oh, Willie Willie Bob? I went to Willie's apartment. Was it fun? Well, he didn't exactly invite me. You mean, I'm gonna have to have you indicted for breaking and entering? I found bank books and a payment ledger. - I copied most of the numbers and the names of the banks. - Mm. What can I do with it? You can't indict someone for having money in the bank. But it's from illegal sources, isn't it? Prove it. I don't understand. Willie has no other source of income except the money he gets from those girls. Couldn't we prove that? It would be almost impossible to connect it. Well, then there's nothing we can do. I didn't say that. I have a friend who probably would... find this very interesting. I want to see him finished, wiped out. My feeling is you are not the only one. All right, he's clean. You're a hard man to reach, Willie Dynamite. I wanna rap. Go right ahead. The heat is irresistible, Willie. It's hittin' the fan right and left. I'm talkin' about your survival now, Willie. That's mighty decent of you, Bell, 'cause I'm always thinking about your survival too. You're wastin' prime time, Willie. You can't hold what you claim. It'll cool out. I don't think so, Willie. No, I don't think so. Take a rest, Willie. You can always come back. Sure, Bell. I could always come back. Better still, Willie, I wanna show you a new area you can work while you're lyin' low. Start up, Willie. Where we goin'? You know the Bronx, don't you, Willie? You, get out! Lie down in the gutter. Pray I don't run you over. Now, Bell, climb over like when you was a kid. Nice and slow. Now, get down, Bell. Down! That's it, Bell. This way, now if we have an accident, you don't get no whiplash. Shut the door! Laces. Welcome... to the Bronx. Willie! Willie! Willie! Willie! If you don't like it, why don't you kick my ass... like Willie kicks yours every time you- You dirty bitch! Don't get up on my account. Crawl! Out! He wanted us to go with Bell. Good. Here you go, baby. Come on. That's it. Get in the flow. Right. Feel it. Yes, that's it! Ha-ha! That's all right! Come on. Stick with it. That's it! Oh, beautiful! Here you go. I hope we can sell you. Willie's here, baby. It's all right. All right. They can't touch me. It's okay, baby. Everything's gonna be all right. Ain't nobody gonna hurt you. No more, Willie. I don't want it anymore. What's the matter, baby? I want out of the life, Willie. I don't want it anymore. That bitch been rappin' to you. I knew it! Listen to me. What happened to us? To our plan together? You're Willie's woman. No one else. No, Willie. No more. I can't do it anymore. Listen to me, baby. Ain't Willie been good to you? Didn't Willie buy you everything you ever wanted? Willie, please! Please, don't make me do it anymore. Remember the way it was before, baby, when Willie found you? Remember the stink in the halls? Remember the roaches? Willie, please! Remember the junkies? What they did to you. How they wanted to do you. Please listen to me. Remember how Willie took you out of it... Please. and brought you to live here. Listen to me! Remember Willie's dream, how Willie's gonna be number one. And all of you are gonna share in it. Willie needs you now, baby, like you needed him before, remember? Willie needs you. You're his woman, not like the others. You know that. You know how special Willie thinks you are. You're Willie's woman. Willie's woman? My woman. Oh, Willie. Make it right. Please make it right. Fantastic. Go get Willie. What is this jive time shit? I beg your pardon? Eve. Split, dog. You don't own nothin'. This is our property. Uh... I- I beg your pardon. You are walking on Willie's territory. He ain't shit. I beg your pardons. I think we've changed our minds. I said walk, chick! I don't take orders from nobody but my old man. See you later, girls. We're not in the mood now anyway. Get back here, you faggot. Shit! Bitch! God damn you! Damn it! Let me outta here! This way, Officer. Over there. What's wrong? I'm sorry, but your accounts have been frozen. What did you say? Weren't you notified? You're under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service... for income tax evasion. No. I don't want no witnesses. Whoa! Watch out! Watch out! Look out! What the fuck is goin' on? Catch you later. The tenement. The tenement next to the alley on St. Mark's. Maybe I should've shot you. They call it mercy killing. Ain't but one other apartment still got anybody living in it. Rodriguez on the top floor and one young guy that hardly comes here. He's right above me. Stop, or I'll shoot! Since no bail has been posted in the directed amount, I remand those arraigned to the Women's House of Detention pending trial. All rise. Just do what we say, baby, and you won't get hurt. Where the hell you goin' with that shit? She doesn't want you. Where you think you're taking her? Nobody cuts out on Willie Dynamite. Look, you bastard. Look. Get me something. I need something. Sure, Willie. Anything you say. I got just what you need right now, Willie. Good-bye, Willie. Dynamite? I found a little coke in your place, Willie. You won't need this. Look what I found, Willie. Who would want to hurt you, Willie? And why didn't you report it to us? You know we're interested in your welfare. Over. Unzip. Slow! Very slow. At this range, I get two birds with one stone. Looks like some friends got here before we did, Willie. Willie, was that real mink? That's a shame. My ex-wife would've dug that. Where have we got him? Possession, use of narcotic implements, carrying a concealed weapon. Three counts. It won't stick. No way. Oh, Willie. I know it doesn't sound like much, but, you see, Pointer here... is gonna find something better sooner or later. Ow! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, man, what- Hey, that's my car, man! What you doin', huh? Cut that shit out! Hey, man, that's some jive shit! Why don't you stop them, man? See what they're doin'to my car? Make them cut that shit out! Why don't you cut that shit out? You're gonna need this. Boston's cold at night, and my friend Celia's a fresh-air freak. Always leaving the bedroom windows wide open. Husband's always catching pneumonia at the weirdest places. You want something to drink? Coke? Beer? Hold on. Guess who's up for arraignment tomorrow. An old friend of yours. What you want from me? I'll call you back. I thought you wanted to see him destroyed. Don't you want to be in at the kill? I thought you hated him. Yes, I wanted to destroy what he was. But hate him? No. I don't hate him. Really? Is this the Cora Williams we all love and admire? You sound like... you're sorry. This is the low-life pimp we are talking about, remember? The scum we wanted to bring down! We should be out celebrating! I gotta go back inside. Does that mean you won't be there? We're gonna fix it. You wait and see. We're gonna fix it. You're gonna be just as beautiful as you ever were.

You know so much. Isn't there something you can do? I don't know- Mama- Ma. Call an ambulance. This moment Seems like it will never end Never end You can't face the day When did this pain begin Pain begin King Midas Your own memory You can't trust When everything you touch Turns to dust Things never last my friend Oh, never No matter the cost If you had one more wish One more wish You'd never regain The things you lost Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh Bell!

I guess I was wild from the start. You know the kind? Had to try it all before I was 15. I was turnin' on before I was 20. No one could hold me. We know the life, don't we, Willie? How do you make someone who hasn't been there know it? Better, how do you keep someone who has from going back? Is that what you're afraid of? I don't know. Yeah, sure I'm afraid of it. I live in fear of it every day of my life. I feel like... I'm walking on the edge of something. Any second, I could fall over. Hmm. And you want me to live like that? No. No, we're different. You're ambitious. You'd get what you want. Am I being reformed, social worker? I got a few cuts and bruises. But remember, everything heals. Even Pashen? And Honey? Willie. Willie, please don't hate me for what I've done to you. That's over. This is for Pashen. I want you to see she's like before. Make it right. Hey, mister, that your car they're towin'? No. Not anymore. When darkness sends shadows round your feet And your motion ends in stumblin' And the moonlight shows only half the face Of the sign that spells "Dead End" And autumn has peeled the green away And left your soul brown and crumbling Left your soul brown and crumbling Don't you know you gotta keep on movin'on Keep on movin'on Keep on keepin'on When nothing can ease your mind And you've got no place to hide Got no place to hide And the wind whistles fears you've never heard Tearing at your pride And all your dreams are made of sand You better wipe the dust from your eyes Wipe the dust from your eyes Don't you know you gotta keep on movin'on Keep on movin'on Keep on keepin'on You gotta keep on movin'on Keep on movin'on You gotta keep on keepin'on
