 

                        we're told that names of your party members figure in the Jain diaries. So what's new? Let the other diary be opened... and see the names popping out. what?! Are we going to have another scandalous diary? lt's not the diary. lt's politics; Politicians have all been exposed. All politicians will be imprisoned now for the bribes they've taken. Then what are we to do about it? Let's form a Corporation; Everybody else is doing it, too. That will even help your unaccounted money be effectively invested. Let's make movies and TV-serials... we can always find good stories. Never mind that... Let's wrap up this story first, Godbole. l'm prepared, Sir... l'm only waiting for the violence to begin. we will not given in... we will have our land! - what is your name? - Sachdev... l've met you 1 3 times in the last 3 months! And you have asked me my name each of those times! You always managed to remember my name during your election campaigns. You have forgotten everything now... including our problems! l remember your problem. You want possession of a land somewhere that... Not a land ''somewhere'' , Mr. Patel... l'm only talking of Gol Chowk! The place where we have earned our livelihood for the last 1 0 years. lt feeds no less than a hundred and fifty families! And what was the place earlier? Dumping ground of the city's refuse! where snakes and scorpions bred! People were even scared to venture out there. we have toiled to give it the respectability of a marketplace. we have ourselves cleaned the place of the dirt and refuse! - He's right! - And now... ...we're being uprooted from there and driven out! Only because Katiya can make a huge shopping-complex there?! why can't you understand the problem? The Government will have do make inquiries. So what's wrong? And what do you wish to inquire about?! lf you're really so keen... ...go and take a look in our homes; we haven't cooked for days! we survive on our daily-earnings, Mr. Patel. And our shops have been closed for 20 days now! Katiya's thugs flex their muscles in broad-daylight... ...making it difficult for our kids and womenfolk to move about freely! Had we helped you win the elections and voted you to power... ...only to face the police's caning, without even being heard? Do you want us to remain silent when your people pelt stones... lt was your goons, and not our people who pelted the stones! Understand?! Now wait... calm down! They're all with Katiya! They have a share in the shopping mall Katiya will build there! - Come to your senses... - lt's you... ...who has to be brought to your senses, lnspector! Listen carefully, Mr. Patel... we have our roots deep in that place. You just can't evict us from Gol Chowk! ln your very presence, we shall go on a hunger-strike... ...with our wives and children. lf death is what we're destined to get, we will choose how we die! The rest is for the Lord to decide. we have a problem indeed. we must meet Katiya soon. who the hell is Katiya to decide our destiny? we own the shops, the land,... and slog on them! Then why must we grovel before anyone? where's the question of groveling? You simply don't understand this! l suggest we settle this without a fight, if that's possible. lt's because of your attitude that we've reached this stage! when Katiya's brother first came here to collect protection money... ...l was against it even then! l had strongly advised them against paying up. But they said then, that it was a question of only two Rupees... ...and it was better to settle it peacefully. But it wasn't just a question of 2 Rupees. lt had to do with acknowledging Katiya's authority! we were bowing to his might...and that is what eventually happened! Their demands for money continued to increase. So much so... ...that he now wants to uproot us from our dwellings! But, do you think a hunger-strike will serve the purpose? we're not political leaders... ...who'll be offered lime-juice to end the agitation. - He's right! - we'll only rot here... - ...and eventually die. - So, go ahead and die! we must prove to them that we are prepared to die! That they cannot scare us with threats of impending death! we will not vacate this place, come what may! l think we must.. That's a special ''soldier'' from Katiya's force. Stopping getting scared... it's here only to escort us to Katiya. The man's fond of many such things. How can l tell you of everything? This way... there's a special program underway in there. lls it a cabaret? Or is it a notch-girl's dance? You're lucky, the soldier didn't hear that. Or he'd have mauled you. The fights and thrills of movies and videos just don't excite Katiya. Then what does? He gets a kick out of seeing death... from handing it out to a live person! He sets man against man; animal against animal... And sometimes, an animal against man, too! He gets a kick out of seeing blood being shed. He rewards those who emerge victorious... ...and enrolls them in his gang. what about the ones who lose? This thug of yours has lost to me, Katiya! Do you still have someone strong enough to challenge me? Hold it! Haven't l often told you... ...not to use these weapons of the cowards... ...to call yourself lion-hearted. Have you seen for yourself the might of my brothers? They're lions... all my six brothers are lions! You have dared to challenge me in my den and lose a duel. Have him thrown in the panther's cage. As for you... You have surrendered to the enemy inspite of being my own man. You have considered your life to be more precious than my honor. And l have no use for such a meaningless life. lt'd be terribly difficult, should they really go on a hunger-strike. They've always stayed there, Mr. Katiya. But if l am pressurized any further, l'll be helpless, too. we have used threats and intimidation... ...but Sachdev doesn't seem to buckle under the pressure. You've had a stroke of paralysis, brother-in-law. - what nonsense are you talking?! - That's not nonsense! lt's true... The Law and the politicians have always been his strong-arms. when they both refuse to work, doesn't it mean he's paralyzed... Stop him, please! what's the rot he's wishing for?! He stays with us, for one. And then acts smart, too. Had we the good sense to throw you out when your sister died... ...we wouldn't have had to put up with your nonsense! l'll kick him out this very moment and throw a party to celebrate it! Brother-in-law! l won't leave my brother-in-law alone... My sister told me before she died, to always serve my brother-in-law... ...and to find my place at his feet. - won't you get lost then?! - Stop it... that's enough. what did you say his name is? why must you alone take the lead in this matter? what's wrong now? we'll face the same fate as others do. why must you try and be the leader? l'm not trying to be the leader; but someone will have to bear the mantle. - we'll have to speak up. - l don't like this. Do you just ''don't like it'' or are you afraid for me? l'm afraid, too. - lf one has to live in the world... - l'm not bothered about the world. All l know is that my world revolves around you alone. And l'm always worried about you. And the Lord above worries about everyone. Don't worry... do you think He'd spare them, should something happen? He'll make them account for their deeds. As for me... l'm only doing my duty, Malti. Let's leave the rest to the Almighty. Hurry up and drop the stuff home; they must've already started it. And make sure to have lots of water before you come. This is no ceremonial fast; it's a hunger-strike. ''we will not vacate this land'' ''we own this land; it belongs to us'' No! No..! Don't! No! This can't be! Save him, somebody...! He's dying! Hear me! Listen to me, please! lt's like this...l don't think my medicines are working on him now. But you can rush him to Mumbai at the earliest... ...and admit him in some big hospital. He'll recover immediately. And, fact is, your brother Shiv stays in Mumbai too, doesn't he? You've said what you have say; let's face it! But don't you know how Dad hates modern medicine? He claims to be brave; but he's scared of a mere syringe! Besides, who'd drill the sense into him? - You can do that, of course! - l ?! Not me... you can do it instead! - lt can only be you! - l?! He's your Dad, after all... and you look after him so well, don't you? lt's settled then; talk to your Dad. l've got to go and see a patient. - That's the truth of the matter! - Mr. Physician! Now you're telling me, are you? Just dressing in clean clothes does not amount to hygiene. You have to maintain a clean neighborhood, too. lf each one of us maintains cleanliness in our area... ...we'd easily have a clean city. ln the cleanliness drive undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi... ...l've joined him in cleaning the filthiest of places. And you folks... ...if you think that's below your dignity,... ...l'll personally sweep this place tomorrow. - That's not necessary, Sir... - we'll do it on our own! - How about the lane, Sir? - That lane leading to the school... ...must be completed at the earliest. Meet the new officer at the Municipality. You must tell him everything about me. l've taken part in the freedom struggle with Mahatma Gandhi. l've even received a letter of acknowledgement. See how quickly the work gets done, when you use my name. Did you see my father around, Radhe? He came this way, didn't he? Oh, sure. He gave us a piece of his mind just now. He's gone to repeat the act a little farther away! You rascal! You're always playing... why don't you go to school? - where's your father? - Good-morning, Sir. why doesn't your son go to the school, Hariya? l drop him at the school everyday; but he runs away from there. l'm now thinking of making him help me out in the fields. Do you want to make an animal out of him in those fields?! Don't you know that Mr. Shastri... ...swam across the river, with his books on his head, to reach school? And, eventually, he became the Prime Minister of our country! But why must this boy swim across the river? His school is nearby. Shut up, you idiot! Now look; a man without education is nothing short of an animal! Just watch out, if your son doesn't attend school from tomorrow! You've been scolding me, Sir... l wish you'd say something to this boy, too. Straighten up! what are you wearing that silly grin for?! The physician has made it clear... ...that you'll have to go to Bombay for your cure. which physician is that? '' Let's face it,'' eh? l was the one who treated him when he himself fell sick. There's no need... l'll grind some herbs for myself. This is a question of your health, father. lt's no social-service. - God forbid, if something... - Shut up! You're getting to be very smart, aren't you? - l know why you refuse to go. - why is that? - l won't tell you. - Go on... tell me! - l won't! - Tell me, or you get a punch! - You're terrified of the syringe. - what?! Listen carefully to what l say... l will, when you set my ear free! well, okay... l will not leave my work behind and go to Bombay! And if you ask me to go ever again, l'll give you a punch! Keep it up, Kashi! Keep it up... Get him...! Get him by the feet! Get up, my son! lt's a question of my honor, mind you! Bravo! Keep it up! Bravo! He's won! Glory to the Lord! Father! Sit down, father... Go on. You're coughing blood, father! Never mind... it's nothing! You did a great job! Bravo! - Listen, Kashi... - what is it? where were you all day? - You haven't even had your food. - l won't have it. why? Are you angry with me? - Yes, l am. - But what's wrong? l understand everything now... l get it all! You'd have left immediately for Bombay, had Shiv asked you to. Didn't you see how seriously ill you were today? You even bled! You don't listen to me because l'm not your own son. Because you found me at the river! Don't you dare say such a thing ever again! - l'll throw you in the Ganges! - l'll swim back to the shores. - l'll throw you back again! - And l'll swim back again... Or who'd look after you? who'd give you a leg-massage? And who'd listen to your scolding? That's enough! You speak any nonsense that comes to your mind! You've begun talking a lot of nonsense, of late. Very well. l'll go to Bombay. But don't you dare say such a thing again! By the way, where will we stay in Bombay? - with Brother Shiv, of course! - No way! Certainly not there! He's an ass, of the first order! lt's 7 years since he's left for Bombay! He's married and even has a kid... but he just doesn't return! - He's become an ass! - Shall l go and wire him? First have your food. And you can send the cable later. - l'll send the wire first... - You must eat first! - l'll send the wire first, Dad! - Listen... Kashi! This chap's become an ass, too! l've heard a lot about your bravery. The nation needs honest and courageous officers like you! l'm only following your teachings, Sir. l pray to God for your recovery and for your safe return. l'll return soon. Actually, l wasn't even prepared to go to Bombay. lt's the physician who forced me to go to Bombay for a cure. l did that only to help you recover quickly, Mr. Shambhu Nath. - Let's face it, eh? - That's right! Let's go, Father. The train's about to leave. You idiot! Can the train ever leave without me?! Come on, father... Very well then, gentlemen... Glory to the Lord! wait, Kashi... l've dropped my cap! lt's okay... l've found it. The holy water... we've even left the city far behind! You've been driving away for the last one hour, driver... You know your way around, don't you? Can't you hear me? l hope you know where we are headed, driver! l know it! l know everything! How am l to blame for the fact that the city is spread out so much?! Am l at fault, just because your son stays far away? l'll take you the right address... But just keep quiet! Okay? - Just talk to him, Mister... - That's okay! Just shut up now, okay? we'd have made it to Mogal Sarai from Benaras in so much of time. l'm a smart man; l've been received a letter acknowledging my achievements. l've even spent some time with Gandhi. Don't try to fool me, okay? l can see your meter ticking away rapidly! why are you picking my brains?! l don't even want any money from you! l'll pay you the equivalent of the fare instead! l'll think l've been on a pilgrimage; that l've had a holy bath! How can you wash away your sins just like that? You'd have to come to Benaras for that and take a dip in the Ganges. But you must come there. l'll arrange a bath and a prayer for you in the Harishchandra shrine. Oh, sure... ...l'll come there; l'll bathe and even shave my head bald! But l will not drive any further! Not anymore! Listen, driver...! Listen... l hope you've sent the telegram to the right address. we've been walking away like mad-men! There isn't a human-being in sight. Have the people here been scared away by the snakes? Real fools you have here in Bombay. The bloody cabby dropped us midway. These guys don't even recognize a person for what he's worth! As for Shiv...! Let me get my hands on him... ...l'll straighten him out by the ears! Take a look at that, father! Our shop... He's named the shop after you. My name, my foot! He's mis-spelt my name! He's clubbed Shambhu and Nath together... ...whereas, they should have been written separately. But we've at least found the shop, haven't we? You don't want to pray before a closed shop, do you?! we wouldn't have had to go about in the hot Sun, if Shiv had received us. The hot Sun is sometimes good for health, Father. l could punch you for that! The whole of the market is shut... there's not a betel-vendor in sight. - Go and find out. - The betel-leaf vendor, eh? Go and find the house, you idiot! You're a fool! You're absolutely good-for-nothing! And where are you taking that box? Keep it here... lt has our money, Dad. who are you? Has Mahadev ( the Lord ) sent you? - No. - You will die! You will die, too... They're all dead! You will also die! There's no one now... they're all gone! who are you? l wonder what the ass has gone and done! what are you doing outside during a curfew? Don't move... okay? what are you doing?! Go and sit down there! l just can't figure out what to do! And all this had to happen today. How will l go to the station? - Open the door! - who's that? - The cops? who?! - Open up! They claim to be your father and brother. Do you know them? - Recognize me, you idiot! - Father! welcome... l wonder where they all come from, to die in Bombay! To die in Bombay?! May you always lead a happy married life. Here you are, dear... it's the holy water from the Ganges. - How was the journey, father? - lt was rotten! why didn't you come to the station to receive us? l was actually about to come. But, then... That's enough! Come to me, my son... Hello! Kashi! Do you know who l am? l'm your grandfather. And l'm the uncle. - Allow me to touch your feet. - Oh no! Don't do that! No formalities. Sheila doesn't care about these. The city-bred hardly have any regard for our customs. Sheila! why must you keep your threads and needles lying about? She was stitching, you see... So you left home to live in this hovel! - How's your work going on? - Fine. By the way... l've already taken an appointment from the doctor. An appointment with the doctor? Yes. lt's for the pain in your throat. You had written about it. Oh yes. l did write to you. But, l've only just arrived. Let me relax for a few days. The doctor comes later. This is your house. You can live here for as long as you wish. - where's the toilet? - Over there. The toilet! Right beside the kitchen?! - l'm scared! - Are you scared of cats? The cat comes to your house and scares you! You must chase it away. - Let's shoo the cat away. - we did it! Sent the cat scurrying! Now open your mouth... wide. wider. wider, please. l'm not a buffalo. l can't open my mouth any wider. - well, all right. - want to see anything more? - No. That'll be enough. - Go on, if you want to. No. l needn't see any more. You see... - May l get up? - Yes. You may. l'm prescribing some medicines. - May l put on my shirt? - Yes. You may. He had thrown up blood in a coughing fit. wait a moment... l'll ask him about everything. ls everything all right? Seems so. But he must be admitted in a hospital for some examinations. Admitted to a hospital?! ls something serious? l could say for sure only after l get a report. He must go through these tests right away. The test first. And then a report. And then comes the treatment. The medicine-man in the village is better. He could tell it all by the pulse. Please do not mind him. How long will he take to recover? l can't say. You must have him admitted to a hospital. The deity is over there. You've brought me to sin! lt was a rotten coconut! The Lord will burn me alive! And He won't spare you either! The Lord is merciful. But incite His anger, and He'll burn you alive. He doesn't spare anyone then. He even burnt his spouse Parvati. But, pray to Him, and He will even give you back your life. Forgive Her, Lord. For she does not know. watch it! This is sub-judice. The court has ruled that the shops may continue... ...to do business till the case is decided. we can carry on business. - Yes! That's right! - You can't do this! But the papers surely show that you are the owner. The papers mean nothing. That which Katiya wants, is going to happen. why? ls he the Collector? Please eat your food. But who is Katiya? The local don. He's a dangerous fellow. He's trying to evict us. They are 7 brothers. Every man a scoundrel. No one can touch them. who said so? For 200 years, the English lorded over this country. And everyone said that no one can touch them. Then came Gandhi. l was with him. we fought for freedom and won it. what a drubbing we gave the English! My friend Sachdev used to say things like that. And look at what happened to him! He was killed like a dog. His wife, the poor girl, lost her mind after that. He kills people like flies! Nitwit! Must you speak so before a child? Now what's the matter with the brave boy? Katiya will kill all of us! To hell with Katiya! Lord Rama killed the 1 0-headed demon. Our brave little boy will kill the one-headed Katiya. won't you, dear? - won't you kill him? - Yes! lt's you! Greetings! l had heard that people get lost in this city. Nice meeting again. - l'm new to this city. - l see. Just came in from Benaras. - Do you live here? - Yes. l thought so. - You seem to be working. - Yes. l'm a nurse in a hospital. - l'm in a hospital too. - what?! l mean to say that l take my father to the hospital every other day. He's suffering from an ailing throat. we're here for his medical treatment. How haven't l seen you in the hospital? ls there only one hospital in Bombay? - Are you going to the hospital? - No. l'm after the city sights. l had asked my brother to take me out to town. But he apologized saying '' Kashi....'' l'm Kashi Nath. People call me Kashi. He gave me a list of the bus-routes and told me... - what's your name? - Gauri; people call me that. well... that's how l'm supposed to go about the city. Bus no. 80 to Bandra. No. 84 Ltd. to Haji Ali. Goodness! l must try out the fruit juices at Haji Ali! why are you laughing? Let me give you a tour of the city. - Really?! - Sure. That'd be fun! won't you wait till the bus arrives? Sure! That's the film star, Amitabh Bachchan's house. - You wanted to see it, didn't you? - This is great, l say! - would brother be in now? - Brother?! Brother Amit ( Amitabh Bachan, the film star) lt's like this; he's actually from Allahabad and l'm from Benaras. Both hail from towns on the banks of the Ganges. Aren't we brothers then? Oh sure... you're brothers indeed. would you like to convey something to your fans? Only that religion and caste be prevented from... ...leading to the division of this great country. Actually, this nation is a home for all of us. we must try to live together like a family. we must care for the whole house... ...and not just our own rooms. Our rooms will remain intact, only if the house itself is secure. Looks like '' brother'' has recognized you. why not? we're brothers, after all! But it was fun, really! - Don't look there! Please! - why not? what a shame! Thief! Thief... Catch him! Catch him, someone! The swine was running away with the purse! - Your aim is amazing! - what's so amazing? That's how l knocked off a ripe mango, amongst raw ones, as a child. - with such a little stone. - l see! l had a coconut today... and the idiot's head was even bigger! - l had to find my mark! - lt's really been fun! You're right! lt's really been fun... - lt's over. - Yes. All the water in that coconut is over! - That's okay. - Shall we move then? Katiya's expecting us, isn't he? Yes. l had sent word. l'm told that anyone who comes to Katiya with a grievance... ...is buried alive in these pillars. That's right! No one has ever been seen walking out alive. - Cut the nonsense! Just shut up! - And where are you going? The truth is that such people are dangerous for the crooks... ...but they're straight with decent folks. we have nothing to fear. lt's only that the pillars reminded me. Or l wouldn't... Shut up! You always remember the wrong things! Don't move! Freeze! lt's a soldier who's come to fetch you. Just follow it quietly. - lt's been tamed... Come along. - Are we so easily dispensable? what is it? These people wish to say something. Actually... some thugs had come to our shops, the other day. what l mean is that some folks came to our shops. Decent folks, actually... Our shops don't run now... lt's very difficult because... ...they've piled up building material before our shops... - lt's an obstacle, you see... - lf that were removed, we could... Talk to him about the legal angle, Gopal... Go on... speak! what are you afraid of? - Not me, please! - what he wants to say is that... ...even the Courts have ruled that... The soldier hates someone talking loudly to my brother-in-law. what l wanted to say is that even the Courts have ruled... Never mind that... The Court has its own place. we've been earning a livelihood in your ''empire'' for 2 5 to 30 years. Our shops are giving us our bread and butter. Anything that you decide... The soldier also hates anyone raising a finger at brother-in-law! we will abide by any decision that you make. - He's right! Anything you say... - Please consider our plight... How many days had l given you to have Gol Chowk vacated? l was to have it vacated in a month. lt's already a month, isn't it? Cut-off one of your fingers then. Running errands? People give doctors the status of God. But l'd place the nurse in the same category, too. How much you care for the patients! ln fact, l think you nurses ought to receive an award. Let's skip this thing about me; tell me about yourself. what would you find in my story? l was an infant when father found me on the banks of the Ganges. He was the one who brought me up. ln fact, he loves me even more than he loves his own son. Brother Shiv would never agree with me... ...but he loves me a lot, too. They all love me. Father even wanted me to study medicine or engineering. But l was never really cut out for studies. And l now work in an iron-products' factory. Come to think of it, l'm very '' qualified'' and ''elegant'' . You mean, ''qualified'' and '' intelligent'' , don't you? But Dad doesn't understand... He always calls me dumb-headed. Do l look dumb to you? Ripper - Naveen @ -=DrC=- lt's a shame that you take so much of time... ...to open the lock of your own house! A burglar would open it faster, without a key! That can't be, father... lt's an old lock. which is why the key gets stuck. Gets stuck, my foot! Kashi's a strange chap... l wonder where he disappears. Didn't your wife know we're returning from the hospital?! She should've been here! She's gone to fetch the kid from school. She must've been caught in a traffic-jam. Caught, indeed... Get me a glass of water! - well, okay. Please sit down... - Go on! what a strange city, this Bombay! You have people getting caught in buses and local-trains! The deadly diseases would kill a man only later... ...but the crowds and the pollution will get to him first! They just don't consider you to be human. They push a man in the crowded local trains, against his wishes... ...and shove him out without his will, too! Father?! You're returned very quickly from the hospital. l'll give you a blow! Have l returned early or have you returned late, you idiot?! - where had you been? - l was held up, Dad... - Not you, too?! - l'd actually been to meet someone. - who's that you went to meet? - Gauri... she's a nurse. l was making friends with her; she could be of help. You're back, are you? And could you see the sights? Actually, l'd asked him to go and see the sights in the city. ldiot! ls he here to see the sights or have me treated?! l'm fed of making the trip everyday. Either have me admitted in the hospital... ...or send me away to Benaras... Have some water, father... Really?! That's wonderful news, my friend! My father's terribly ill, Mister. Please let us have a room. l've already told you so many times... ...that there's no room for any more patients in the hospital. l'll join you, too! There isn't much work here. lt can always be taken care of. - The doctor has sent a note. - Sent a note, eh? Then have the patient admitted in the doctor's house! what can l do, when there's no room? l can't possibly have him lying on my head, can l?! - Have you got an admission? - No; he says there's no room. Couldn't you manage it then? Didn't you tell him who l am? l've fought the war for freedom with Mr. Gandhi! where's Shiv? He's gone to talk to someone, too. Talk! Big deal! Can't you do anything else, but talk?! lf you happen to know a ward-boy or a maid in the hospital... ...you could manage to wrap this up quickly. well, never mind... Take this... and go and show it to him! Let me see how he still refuses me an admission! Go on... Hurry up! - Mister... Mister! - what is it? - Take a look at this. - what is that? lt's a certificate of honor. And what's this certificate supposed to mean? My father got this for the services he rendered to the country. lt's for him that we need the room. Yes, Sir? ... Very well, Sir... l'll be on my way! My father had joined Mr. Gandhi in the battle for the nation's lndependence. why did he fight for lndependence? what have we got out of it? Those days of slavery were better than these times of freedom! The entire system has rotted! And they bring certificates of honor to the hospitals! They should've sold it in scrap instead! Haven't l told you there's no room? Please leave me alone! There's no point in running from pillar to post. Bring a thousand Rupees and l could pull a few strings. lf it's okay with you, come to the rear-entrance. You've got admission, haven't you? which room is it? Answer me... which room could you get? Couldn't you manage it? Useless chaps, you both are! Didn't you show him this certificate? l did! l did show him the certificate! And he asked him to fling it in the garbage can! why did you ever have to fight for our lndependence?! what has our lndependence given us? when they don't care for the Gandhi they pretend to revere, who are you? Please calm down, Mister... we have a man dying here... ...and that chap is busy chatting away on telephone! He's reading a novel! And that pimp of his... ...asks for a thousand Rupees for the admission! - Sit down... please. - Are we here for fun?! ls this a pleasure-trip?! They just can't understand a poor man's dilemma. They treat us like animals! They've made a slaughter-house out of this bloody hospital! The poor will die here, on a bench like this... ...but they still wouldn't be concerned. Hey, Kashi... what's up? Calm down... l've got the admission for Dad... Let's go... Come on. Come along... Tell Mr. Bharat that his work will be taken care of. But the supply of currency-notes mustn't stop, okay? Here's Laxmi ( the Goddess of wealth ), Savitri. Laxmi? where is she? lt's the Goddess of wealth... the money, l'm talking about! How often have l told you not to give me the money you get in bribes? l can very well manage in the salary you earn. - Get on with it, Pinky... - There you go again! l'm not earning it for myself, am l? lt's only for my darling, Pinky... ...so that she can have all the comforts and luxuries in life. But you don't ever stop nagging me! That's because l always have a fear in my mind... ...that your ill-gotten wealth could shatter the happiness of our family. Stop it now! what brings you here? That's because some hooligans ransacked Mishra's shop yesterday. As for the police complaint, we have already lodged it. But this morning, a couple of thugs beat up his son very severely. lt was a brutal beating, Sir... They've broken his hand... ...and even cracked his skull. Please do something, Sir... when we took his son to the hospital, the doctor said... ...it's a police case; that we should lodge a complaint. Since it all happened because of the complaint he lodged yesterday... ...we don't know whether we should lodge another complaint or not... That's not really the problem. But l can't engage a constable for every person's security, can l? - You're right, Sir. - well, suppose... ...l post some constables on duty at the square. The thugs would return and bash him up, the minute the police leave. Actually it's that piece of land which is causing problems. Vacate the place as soon as possible and hand it over to Katiya... ...your problem will be solved. The land and the shops belong to these gentlemen, lnspector. why don't you imprison those thugs, instead of throwing these people out? who's this man? This is Kashi; he's come in from Benaras. He's Shiva's younger brother. Shiv took his father to the hospital, and his brother joined us instead. lt's always better to come in groups, isn't it? - Greet the lnspector. - Now this is another problem! what's happened to you, dear? You're bleeding! The cursed blade! why don't you use the pencil-sharpener! And what are you asking silly questions for?! Look! She's bleeding... Don't just stand and watch! Call the doctor... Call him up and tell him that we're coming there... Don't worry, dear... lt'll be alright. - She's hurt her finger. - Must've bled a lot. what will happen of my son? we'll see about that later... Shall we leave? Here we are at last! Hey, you! You'll get a punch! They're terribly rash drivers. This is our shop... but is today a holiday? what holiday? All shops on that side are open. But brother had told me that we'd meet here. And all shops on this side are closed, too. - where could they have gone? - They're all dead! They're all dead! Come closer... come on! They're all dead... l'm the only one alive. You must've been sent here by the Lord, right? This shop here belongs to Sachdev. lt's our shop, you know! what are you looking for? what do you want? You get everything here... care for some bridal-wear? The lady's a nut! Running away, eh?! You're a nut... And so is your whole family! You're going to die, too, you rascal! l can't say why, but l always feel as if l've heard her voice earlier. This woman and her husband have paid a price for living with dignity. They're staring their construction from today. How about our business?! what will happen to our shops... what business are you talking about? we keep our shops open for not more than a week in a month, in any case. - So? There was at least something... - when will the buildings come up? This builder has a great reputation; his buildings come up overnight! - what?! - l heard that being said... He's going to die! The scoundrel's going to die! He's even digging a grave for himself! - Sawant! Take her away... - You'll die a miserable death! Curse be on you, you swine! - You'll die... you surely will! - Take her away! You'll die thirsting for water! Your sins will run their course! There won't be a soul to sympathize with your clan, you scum! You have killed my husband... ...and l will kill you! l will kill you! There! The pitcher's broken even before your funeral... ...l mean, even before you can complete the ceremony! You're going to die! You will be wiped out! - Father! - How long have you taken to come! l can't help it. l have to change three buses to get here. The nurse said that we'd have to leave the hospital. - why is that? - How would l know?! - Go and ask the doctor... - Very well. And tell him that my problem is getting worse. How are we going to manage? Go and talk to him... - Go on, will you?! - l'm off, Dad... here l go. Have you asked my father to go home, doctor? That's right, Kashi. Your father is now in the last stages of cancer. l'm sorry, but it's too late... Nothing can be done about it. Can't we do anything about it? with such a renowned hospital and its qualified doctors... Please take another look at him... we have come to you with great hopes. You don't have to worry about the costs, doctor. we'd even sell everything we own! But save my father... Please! Please save my father Your father has just another month or two. which is why l felt that he must spend the rest of his days... ...with his family. Take him home. You will have to be brave, Kashi. who'd look after him, if you were to break up like this? Get a hold on yourself. what did the doctor say? The doctor says that you'll recover with the medicines at home. He says there's no need for you to stay here anymore. But didn't you tell him that the pain is getting worse? He's prescribed a medicine for that; that will help you recover. lf l stay here, l'd have the nurses and doctors should l need something. You'd recover faster at home, with your own people around. That is right, too. Very well then... we'll return to Benaras in that case. Let's take Shiv and his wife along, too. The kid's thread-ceremony is yet to be performed... Besides, that road we're laying to the temple in Benaras... ...l've also got to obtain a sanction for that. l've got to have the school inaugurated. l can accomplish all this in a matter of a few months in Benaras. My son... Listen, son... ...death is a reality, just as life is. One has to accept it. Be brave, my son... l have already lived my life... ...and want to spend the rest of my days with dignity. That's all l ask God to grant me. You mustn't let this shake you... You're my brave boy, aren't you? Let's go... Come on. Don't, my son... Stop crying...! Let's go... Come on, my son. Let's go... Get up. Come on... And look; don't tell anyone at home about this, okay? They'll be terribly worried. Let's not tell anyone, okay? Let's leave then... Come on. Stand up... let's take our things and leave... Get up,... Come on. You dare insult Katiya, eh! That man... that rascal is hitting me! He's hitting me! Listen, fellow... Just get lost! Scram! No! l don't want anyone of you to interfere! Let's get away, Kashi... that's Katiya's thug; a vicious character. Get him! They're all dead... And you will also not escape! You're being funny, brother! Our guys get beaten up and you laugh at it! what else can l do, but laugh? Just imagine... ...one man, all alone, beats up 1 0 of my boys in the marketplace. - what a sight it must've been! - Must've been a terrific sight! l wish we could all see it, too. Shut up! The day l strip you in the marketplace... ...everyone will have a sight to behold! Let me have some chicken... the leg-portion. So, tell me now... what am l supposed to do with you? Just give me one more opportunity, Sir... l could even give up my life for you. He'd even give up his life for me, he says. Very well then... l'll take your life. Throw him the lion's cage. Kashi...! Come on! Hurry up! Let's go... leave that alone! - Let's go! Hurry! - what's wrong? Have you had a fight with someone? - wear this! Quick! - But what's up? l'll tell you later... Just don't open the door for anyone. what's going on, Shiva... where are you taking Kashi to... The chaps you've beaten up belong to Katiya's mob! He hacks people to pieces in a crowded marketplace! - This is not your home-town. - l know that! This is a city of eunuchs! They beat up a woman and humiliate her in broad-daylight... ...and all you do is to watch the fun! Anyone who helps her is a fool! An ass! And what have you achieved out of it?! what's the big deal?! You've saved her today... alright. But what happens when they beat her up again? l'll give him a thrashing again! l'll beat them up all over again! lf something like this happens in my presence, l'll beat them up again! l just can't bear to watch it silently! lf someone were to misbehave with your wife in public... ...would you still be giving me the same advise? what's all this?! who are you?! - where's he?! where's Kashi? - He's not around. Flexing your muscles, eh? Encouraging thugs, are you? - where's Kashi? we want him! - But what has he done? Shut up... or you'll be cut to pieces! lf you want the kid back, bring Kashi to us and take the kid away. Or we'll make mincemeat out of the kid! My son... ! Oh, get lost! what can they do at most? Kill me, isn't it? l'd even die, but l'd never leave father alone! You don't know about this, brother. But the doctor says father is... Are you his own flesh and blood then? l'm his own son! l care for him, too! Try to understand this, Kashi! Your presence here will endanger our lives, too! They are capable of doing anything! And just don't worry about Dad... l'll take care of him! Here's what you must do... Keep this money. There's a train leaving from here at dawn tomorrow. Take the train; it's not safe for you to stay here anymore! l must leave now. Even after knowing that Kashi's life is in danger... ...you still left him there, all alone?! That too, in a city where he knows no one?! Had you gone mad? You bloody coward! So what if he's not your own brother... ...he means much more than what brothers really are! He'd give his life for you! He's turned out to be a better person than you are! when you left for the city to achieve something in life... ...he was the one who cared for me in the village. He did everything a son should do! Kashi has a heart of gold... My son, Kashi, is a real gem! l will not stay here anymore. l will return to my son. l'll even breathe my last there. And l don't need people to carry my bier to the cremation ground! Kashi alone is enough to do that for me! For how long will you sit there like a bloody statue? who will bring back your son? They've said that they want Kashi in return for your son. And since Kashi is not here now, how will your son return? what will you do, if something happens to your son?! O Lord! You've always been merciful towards us... - where can l find Katiya? - why do you want Katiya at this hour? l want him... Let's go and find him! - But what's happened? - They've taken my nephew away! They want me... they'll get me! Let's go and find Katiya. - But Katiya... - l'll tear the scoundrel apart... ...if my nephew suffers as much as a scratch! Relax, Kashi... the kid will be okay; God will protect him. Besides, you just can't walk in on Katiya like this. lt's difficult to tell the movements of even his brothers. But you can meet his brother Antya tomorrow. He visits the City light Club every evening to collect the spoils. This is where you will find him, Kashi. - l'll find Antya here, won't l? - of course; he comes here everyday. Two tickets, please. Don't let the joint mislead you. lt isn't what it appears to be. Let's go inside... the real fun lies there. Leave me alone, Chandru... Else, he'll go away! Easy come, easy go, baby... Nothing comes out of it! - what's wrong with you? - Nothing. Do you know that girl? - That isn't the same Gauri, is she? - No. Here you are, Sir... Today's collection. So little? Have you been stealing the dough or are the collections really low? Anrway... go and deal with Gauri. And you keep the money. How will we manage if you continue like this, Gauri? The bosses at the Club will throw us out... ...and without the money, how will l be able to treat your sister? what'll l do? Nothing... And there are so many more tests that have to be carried out. Tell me now, whether this is true or not... A lame-horse is always shot dead, isn't it? what do we do with the humans? Nothing? Aren't you ashamed to speak like this about your wife? Not at all. Okay. You'll get the kid. But you'd have to fight Akram Khan Paqhtuni for that. To get my nephew back, l'd fight anyone. Uncle! Uncle! That's a terrible character! He kills a man and then plucks his heart out! That's what they say about him. He'd need a real heart to pluck out mine. - My son! - Uncle! lt's good that you've stopped him. Or you'd have been six brothers instead of seven! l'm happy to have witnessed your acts of bravery. You will also be happy to know... ...that you shall henceforth work for my gang. This is a laborer's hand, Katiya... ...which can even mould raw iron. This is strength l've earned from money earned with toil and sweat. l don't need to live on the crumbs somebody throws to me. Rather than live the life of scum in the filthy streets... ...you should rather live among real men; like a tiger. Even a caged-tiger is nothing more than a mere dog, Katiya! You want me to be a mere dog at your feet, do you? A dog which barks and bites at your will?! You could say that... So what's wrong? Should you work for me, you'll soon be famous. You'll receive handsome rewards. Besides earning a lot of money... ...you'll be a widely respected man... ...and people will be terrified of you. Only cowards, who have water flowing in their veins, terrorize people! lf you're really fond of flaunting your manliness... ...stop depending on your dogs, Katiya! He walks into our den and humiliates us! That's enough! l'll now have to plan a death for him. - Yes, sister? - what's wrong? You seem to be lost in your thoughts these days. what's up? Had a tiff with Kashi, did you? Not at all. There's nothing of the sort, sister. Didn't you tell me that Kashi's going to visit us? when is he coming over? He'll never come here now, sister... Never. But why? - He saw me at the club. - So? l hadn't told him that l dance at the club... And why didn't you tell him? You should've told him... ...that it's not out of your will... ...but to save your sister that you dance at the club! l knew something of the sort would happen one day. And you...! Hadn't l already warned you? why are you spoiling your life for my sake? l wish l'd die... Don't say that, sister... lt's still not late... Tell Kashi the truth... l'm sure he'd understand. l'm sure he'd never desert you. Please hear me out, Kashi... what else can l now listen to? Haven't l already seen enough? Try and con the Almighty now... He's innocent; He'll believe your tale. But it is you l want to explain the truth to! we had to go through all this because of Chandru. l wanted to tell you everything on several occasions... But for fear of losing you, l just couldn't... l'll leave now, Kashi. l'm taking my father back to Benaras tomorrow. The doctor has given up hopes. He wants my father to spend the rest of his days in peace. But l will return to take you away. You will accompany me to Benaras, won't you? l'd have been happy, had you too accompanied us, Shiv. This thing about the land is yet to be sorted out. Besides, my son has his school too. l can't come over just yet. well then, brother... Forgive me for any mistake l must've made. why must you say that?! You'll see that l'll call you back the moment this thing is sorted out. And you... why did you have to take Katiya on again? - Couldn't you keep quiet? - And do what? Be a slave to him? - Lick his feet?! - There you go again... l hate this habit of yours! Just forget the past. You must never fight when you set out on a journey. Take good care of your wife and your son, okay? You'll come to me at Benaras, won't you Munna? Bless you. what are you guys up to?! Let him go! Leave him alone! what has he done, after all?! Leave him alone! Listen! Please listen to me! Listen! Please! The window! Use the window! Hurry up! Let him go! Someone save my brother,...! Help! Don't hit him! Let him go! Please don't hit him! Please save Kashi! Let Kashi go, Katiya... Please spare him! Please don't hit him! Please let my son go! No...! Please don't! Please set my son free! Your father's a bloody dog! Do you see that, Kashi Nath?! You had claimed that you didn't want to be a dog at my feet. But look at this... ...your father is wagging his tail before me, as a dog would! He's even licking my boots! And a dog's offspring can only be a dog; never a lion! Your father's a dog; and you're a son-of-bitch! You're a dog, no less! l could have killed you the other day, if l so wished. But granting you death then... ...would have been a reward for your bravery... ...and not a punishment! This... this is your punishment! Just look at his state... this is what your punishment is! You will curse yourself every time you take a breath, hereafter! Your life will seem to be a burden and you will long for death! when you've had enough, come to my doorstep... Should l feel charitable then, l'll grant you death, too! Go on, you filthy dog... Go to your puppy! - Father... - My son! Father! How's your father now? - Look, Kashi... - what's going on over here?! what are you both doing here, so late in the night? Nothing; we were only sitting here. Let's go, Kashi... How can you do this? Don't you respect the law? we stay in the neighborhood and so... This girl? She's the one who dances in the seedy joint. Dances, eh? Lock her up then... Don't! Please, don't! Please don't hit me! Stop it, Kashi...! Let him go! Leave him alone, Kashi! Please! And what will these guys do? Kill me, eh?! They can only hang me, isn't it? l'm rather die...but l can't live the life of a coward! l can't be impotent! How can l tolerate anyone touching you in my presence? l'd hack them to pieces! where were they, when those swines made a dog out of my father?! ls it a sin to wish to live with honor and dignity? All we want is to lead a life of respect! we had only come here to have my father treated. And they made a dog out of him! They revere him, back there in Benaras; they salute him! And what happens here? Out here,... No, Kashi... Don't cry. He's a very nice man, lnspector... Please let him go. Let him go is not the problem. The problem is that when you're in love with him... ...why didn't you drill some sense into him? why did he have to mess with Katiya at all? This is what he gets out of messing with Katiya, right? Had he worked for Katiya, he could have quietly enjoyed himself. Quietly? Like you, isn't it? Shedding all his shame in the process, right? Great! You dance in a seedy joint... and talk of respect?! Of course l dance... that too, in a club. l earn my money with sheer hard work... ...and don't earn my livelihood from sin, like you do! You earn your bread and butter from the Government... ...but you're a slave to Katiya! Just you wait...! Now where is my register? Once l file charges against him, he'll be thrown in for 7 years! Very well then... go ahead and file the charges! Just you open that register and start writing. Go on! The constables attached to your station, held my held! Your constables got drunk and misbehaved with me! They not only grabbed my hand... they even tore my clothes! Look! They even ripped open my clothes! write that! Open your register and record my statement! You will record it... You certainly will! l'll assemble some women here who will stand witness! File the charges...! Go on! what are you staring at me for?! There's no problem there... l'm the one with problems. Hey... let him go. we've even tamed that muscleman you got from Benaras. we publicly made a dog out of this chap's father! lnspite of all this, your shops are still open and business goes on! - But the Courts... - what Katiya says is the law! My brother had his special man's finger cut, all because of you. Could you still dare do this? lt's not a question of daring; it's our necessity... Cut the dialogue! - Tell us your name. - Ambikaprasad Satyanarayan Tiwari. - How much does your shop measure? - lt's 1 0 feet by 1 2. - Pay him 50,000. - But it has stuff worth 1 ,50,000! lt's 40,000 then. Quietly take whatever Katiya is giving you and just get lost! Don't worry, boss... l'm keeping a watch on them. Anyone who opens the shutters of his shop... ...will have to lose his life! You don't wish to be a dog at my feet! But look; your father is very much a dog for me! He's even licking my boots! Your father is a dog for me! Your father's a dog for me! He's licking my feet! Your father's wagging his tail before me! He's licking my feet! Learn to contain your temper, my son. You came to see whether l was still alive, right? So that, after l'm dead... ...you can finish Katiya and go to prison. But you must learn to nurture your temper. when Gandhi was thrown out of a train in South Africa... ...he didn't waste his fury on the Ticket Collector. ln fact, he preserved all his rage... ...and turned into the foundation of his struggle for lndia's freedom. He eventually won lndependence for his nation. That is exactly what you will have to do, Kashi. Killing Katiya is not the solution to our problems. Because Katiya is not our enemy. lt is actually the terror he strikes in people's hearts... ...which is even more lethal than the cancer that has struck me. lt is fear that has stifled all voices. lt's rendered them hollow! You will have to instill confidence in the people... ...and make them so brave... ...that even a child may take on Katiya, when the need arises! Katiya will die on his own... ...and we'll never have another bully again. Just learn to contain your anger, my son... what are you doing here at this hour? Are you drunk? Lock the shutters. - Have you had liquor, brother? - Sure! l've had liquor indeed! After ages, l've done something l felt like doing l've made up my mind, Kashi. l'll give up everything here and return to Benaras. Give up everything? This shop... this land of yours? Everything? Do you still think everything here belongs to me? lt's gone... l've lost everything, brother. lt's all over for me. l'll now manage in the piece of land l have in Benaras. Land? You have no land there. we have fields in Benaras, don't we? A coward can't ever own any land, brother. what nonsense are you talking? You're running away from this land because of Katiya today. There'll be another bully tomorrow. How will you protect your land? Stop lecturing me! You're preaching to me, eh?! l've personally seen terror in that square there! l have even borne it! Okay... l can't indulge in hooliganism like you do! Fighting for one's rights is not hooliganism! Rights, my foot! which rights are you talking about?! Even our documents have begun to gather dust! lt's sheer nonsense! All that talk about rights and justice is nothing but nonsense! There's only one law that prevails out here... might is right! That's it! '' Might is Right'' ! You're lucky that Katiya should have had his eye on your shop. Had he eyed your wife, you'd have deserted her, too. Aren't you ashamed to talk like that? She's my wife...! The honor of our home... - She's your sister-in-law! - And this land is our Mother! will you abandon the land that gave you your bread and better? The land, because of which you got married... ...and which helped you bring up your son... ...could you ever desert such a piece of land?! lt's not a piece of mere land... lt's your honor itself! lt's your self-respect, brother! And there's nothing more precious Nothing! l've made a vow. l'll die, but l won't leave my shop! But no one has taken your shop. lf you open your shop, all the... other shops will be in trouble! Hey!...who's opening their shop? His shop. -Yes it's me who opened... -what will you do about it? -Come in the middle. -Start counting. One...two....three...four! -You hit first! -No one will interfere! Today it will be you! l said no one will interfere! Hit me....l said hit me. l'll take a lade. -Hey he's about to come. -Close the shop. Nothing will happen. -where is he?....There he is! -The rascal! He's come....see! See! You're for real! -Look Shiva. we understand. -we understand everything. But tell us one thing. Us shopkeepers...will we run our... business....or fight those thugs? Do you have other strong people... in Benares Kashish? Bring 1 0-1 2 of them here. we'll give them what they want. Yes we'll give them a place to stay. we'll raise them. First you'll raise them... Then when they become thugs? You'll raise thugs! we have to do what needs to be done! Nothing will go wrong for you. Your brother is a strong man. l don't even have a brother. Shiva...you fight. Your shop will go. Dama Kaka...for us its no go. why won't you listen... all of us will go together. -ls the shop running? -Their all closed! we can't fight those thugs! -And the police won't listen to us! -They will listen. The police will listen to you. They will have to listen. what will he do now? Yes l've sent the picture. Also have sent all the details. why won't you people understand... she's my daughter! She's missing since noon.. no news as of yet! Barricade the city! Put the whole police force on this... if needed! But l need my daughter back! what?...forget the commissioner... l'll even talk to the minister! -what did they say? -Keep calm. Nothing will happen to her...nothing. l'm really scared. This is all your fault! -lf anything happens to my daughter... -Nothing will happen to her! She has died! -She's been murdered. -what? The police does nothing without proof... Here take this. when did it happen? How did it happen? who did it? Make an inquiry. -Have to make a case. -we'll lnspector? who knows how many kids have... died on the streets. who never had a case. And the ones who had a case... Their file never got opened. You're kneeling after finding out.. your daughter's been murdered? The person you have made angry... is the one who killed her. -But why kill her? -why kill Pinky? what did she ever do to anyone! why?. The hand was cut off... ...from the person who only... wanted his right...why? His wife was killed at your police station... She turned mad. then got no justice. why? A person is treated like a dog. made to.. look like a fool...why? People ask for their rights... kneel before the authorities... ...pay you bribes...they can't even eat.. why?. why? No telling how many people have suffered.. why?...why? why?...because the law and justice... sit enslaved! And while all this happens... this is the way it will be! You are responsible for this murder. An office as yourself make life difficult... for a man. Your daughter has paid for you're... misdeeds. why didn't l die before seeing.. all this! The death you want because of this... this is how we live day to day. Pinky...take care of your father. wait Kashi. You did the right thing. This was the way to convince me. l'll fight with you. whether l keep my job or not. -whether l die or not... -l promise you... Katiya cannot remove you from the land. Hey...look at him. Greetings. lnspector...as you know... yes its Shiv Rath. Yes it is Shiv Rath...but we are... going crazy because of the shops. This is all because of the lnspector. lt's not because of me... but because of Bhole-Nath. He has sent Kashi as our savior. Sir, tomorrow we are starting our... business. -lt will be calm won't it? -Of course it will. within 2-3 days a new police station... will open here. This is why l'm going to Delhi. And l promise you, Katiya and all... his men will be arrested. Now you will have to take blessing's. At night we have planned a religious... function. l want you to come for sure. we will a lot of fun and play. A religious function with fun and play? Here take this. Here are some passes that were forgotten... at the police station. A new club is opening...Go there... and have fun and frolic! OK l'm going. Goodbye. -wow...That was fun. -The dance was great! where did they go? Hey Dhamoo-Kaka...come here! Everything will be OK. Be calm...all will be fine. what happened is terrible. Katiya is very hurt because of this. Because of this, he has come... to meet you himself. People will talk... ...that Katiya has done this deed. But everyone knows, that whatever... Katiya does... ...he does it openly. He does in front of everyone. And does in broad daylight. This is a fatal incident... Dead people will get RS.20,000... ...and injured people...Rs 1 0,000. l give right now. Not 2 years later as the government does. And another thing... you never know when death may grip you. This know one knows. Those who are living... should remember this! That this incident could happen to... them as well. Let's go. Let me go! -Let me go! -Bastard! You dare lay your hands on Katiya! Lay my hands?...l'll pull your heart... out you bastard! You dare lay your hands on my brother! l'll bash you over and over! l'll bash you over and over! l'll tear you apart you bastard! l swear, by tomorrow sunrise... forget tomorrow...l'll burn now! You'll burn me alive? -Come on..Let's go... -Let the bastard go! lf all 7 of you are of one father... l swear upon the Ganges... l will kill you in your own house! l'll kill all 7 of you...all 7! -Stop! -l made your father a dog! You also... -Here... -wash your face brother in law. The dirt will come off from... this hot water. But the disgrace that's on your face... -The disgrace will be washed by blood! -Kashi's blood! l need his blood!....His blood! No telling which mole Kashi... is hiding in. Looks like he ran back to Benares. we'll look here. what happened? who did all this? After l swore to kill all 7 of you... together... ...all 7 of you started wandering... separately. Not wandering separately... ...but looking for you as your death! Death is awaiting you here. Talk...want to die alone... or with your brothers? Tear him apart! why are you all ashamed? Drink! This is Anthes party. He loves throwing a party. He loves wining and dining people. Go ahead and drink. lf you won't drink...Anthe will... not like it. Drink! Hey Anthe, everyone is at your party... but no one is wining and dining. You tell them. They will listen to you. Just like you listen to me. He's a good brother. A very good brother. He respects me very much. Listens to me. Does not do anything... ...without asking me. But today! But today...he's died without... asking me. Died like a dog. Now what do l do with you? Burn! -This is what was your fate! -Burn! Didn't you think of me before dying? Didn't you think of how l would feel? You should have asked me! l wouldn't have let you die! Katiya has said... if anyone helps in lifting this... dead body... his whole family won't be spared. Call the municipality to lift his body. 4 men please step forward... lt's time to give shoulder to... the body. Please 4 people step up, it's time... to lift the body. Panditji, according to the rituals... four men are needed. There are no men left here. There are no men left here! They have all died! No one can do anything! You will have to do this alone. All alone. l don't need four men! Kashi is sufficient to lift my body! Boss, Kashinath will seek police... protection when he spreads the ashes. lf you say so... Take the handcuffs off Kashi! Hey...Kill the bastard! Look...lssue an arrest warrant on Katya... and all his brothers. Him, all his thugs, immediately! Not the police... Not the police... lf you want to help.... don't interfere. Keep away from this fight. Kashi, those people have gone mad! They kidnapped the boy by hiding in.. your house! l don't know... All they can do is kill him! Let him die! But Kashi... They will kill the shopkeepers... Let them die as well. But now l don't need the police. The one who will survive... will be the one who is self sufficient. Not by the crutches of the police... ln this either we will win... ...or we will have a clear loss. Those who have guts... will be the victors. He will live who deserves too. where's the boy? Uncle! Uncle! Don't beat my uncle! You didn't do good Kashinath. Not right. The day l gained conscience... l never cried. But now you've made me cry. First you hurt me, then you put... salt on my wounds. You didn't do right. Takes a long time... to put fear into a person. My life has now gone... ...but not you! we were seven brothers. All of us lions. Out of which you killed four. Not four but five. wait! what are you doing? lf you kill him, they will make... a statue of him. People will worship him! Kill those who revere him! So people will once again fear you! Keep quite kid!.... Quite! This is the first time you've talked... sensible. You will receive peace in your soul soon. And my vow will soon come true. The vow your brother took upon... your death. That while l don't take care... of your murderer Katya... l will stay here... on their scraps! ln shame. with this naked body! But sister... the day has come to cover it! Because l have the destruction of... Katya in Kashi's eyes. Katiya's destruction! Come outside! Look your master has come...your master! Come and see your master! Katya came to give your land back... on that same land he crawls like an ant! Your prophet is asking for water! ls there anyone to give him water? l made his father a dog! ...and him a bull. He fought alone for you... is there a supporter of him left? who will give him water? Anyone? Look Kashinath...Your supporter has... brought you water. Let her go. He asked me for land! He asked for this space! we will kill him on this land! How will you kill him....how? -You're dead yourself! -You'll kill him? Alone...alone he destroyed your empire! -what do you have left? -All your thugs have left you! He killed all your brothers! l'll make you dance on this very spot... in front of all to see! Make you dance now! Let go! How will you make me dance? Making a man of yourself by tying... him up? He will get up...he will! He'll make a cabaret of you! And you will dance! Hit him...Hit him! Hit him!...Hit him! Get them...get them! Hit that bastard!..Hit him! Bark!...Bark you dog! Leave me alone...l'll beat his rascal... he will bark! No one will interfere!...l'll kill... them all! Leave me alone! Bark!....Bark!...Get up! Get up!....Bark! Bark!....You dog you will bark! Go son, tell your uncle... we have to spread grandpa's ashes. Go. -Bark...Bark! -Uncle... Grandpa's ashes.
