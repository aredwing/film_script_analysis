 

                        Woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof! Nice try, fleabag. Zeus! Get outta here! Blcch, Dog germs! Do I smell some dinner?! Breakfast. I knew that. You've been up all night again, huh? Sorry, it's just that I've been working on this Melody And it's somewhere in there. I just can't find it. What's this? Breakfast burrito. Cool, thanks. Let me see your face. Excellent, b+. So, what's in this burrito? Eggs, refried beans, onions, jalapeos, Peanut butter, mozzarella cheese, pineapple chunks. Oh, yeah, and lettuce. So it's nutritionally balanced. Oh, shoot! My burrito! Ugh! Zeus, psst. C'mon, c'mon. Good boy, eat it up. Thank you, thank you. Oh, good, you finished yours. I'll go get you another one. Woof! And you two stay At the enrichment program all day, okay? you-are-understood-mother. Ditto. I'm not in the mood for the principal calling me Telling me that you two- What is that? Lovely. Jordan, cow bone! Woof, woof, woof! Hey! Ahh! Cow bone. Cow bone, cow bone! Zeus, cow bone! Zeus! Zeus, cow bone! Zeus, cow bone! Cow bone! C'mon, go on! Go on! Pfft... I'm so sorry. Let me help. No, that's okay. Oh, jeez. Here, let me help. Just how do you propose to do that? I'll put your flowers back in the ground here. Wait, wait, no. Actually, I have a very particular way of doing this. I like to put the roots in the ground. Oh... Very... You new in the neighborhood? Yeah. Just renting for the week? Actually we'll be here 'till the end of July. Great! I'm Terry Barnett. Mary Beth... Dunhill. Mary Beth. Right. I'd love to stay and chat in my present state But I'm late for work. That's okay, I'll just replant your flowers. Oh, no, that's alright. Is there anything I can do? Uh, no. How 'bout your laundry? I'm a great ironer. If you can just restrain that... Zeus. Yes! Thank you. Me, Terry, you? Judith. You? Nora. You're late. I've been frantic, don't ask. What if Roxannes not there? We've never been late before. What if she gets eaten by a shark Sitting there waiting for us? What if I'm sorry, Becky, I had a rough morning? Oh, yeah? Well, it's about to get rougher. We've been rejected by the Pason Foundation, And the manheim, And the delphi. Great! That leaves the Rockland Grant. If I don't get that, I'll be- Stocking goldfish at the local store. Very funny, Claude. I wasn't joking. Perhaps we should strive for that grant together. "the sum of the parts being greater than the whole." I don't think so. Somehow I think our research philosophies are slightly different. Oh, I didn't know I ever had one. Let me know if you change your mind. He should be working with sharks. He'd feel more at home. If I don't get major funding soon Roxanne's gonna be in a pool Doing sound recognition tests for the rest of her life, Probably for him. Good morning, guys. Hey, Phil. Let's play the sounds of the other dolphins for Roxanne And see if she runs away. Okay, Roxanne, I'm comin', sweetheart. We'll do a body check, check for rake marks. We'll see if she's been playing with other dolphins. These are from our last session, right? Right. Burritos? Do you smell burritos? Yeah. You. You're so cute! No, this dog is not cute. This dog is the hound from hell. C'mon, you Zeus, whatever your name is. Get up here, sit down, sit! Sit, stay. Stay. Zeus! Yo, Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! I think I got Roxanne. Great! I'm cursed. He's so cute. He's not cute. You stay right there Or you're gonna get a free swimming lesson! He's giving me a face like that. Zeus! We've got her. Roxanne, sorry I'm late. C'mon, that's a girl. Good morning to you too, Roxanne. How are you? C'mon. Very good. Woof, woof! Thanks a lot, Zeus! Maybe if we give him some food he'll calm down. Maybe if he becomes food he'll calm down. She did not mean that. Yes, I did. we're outta here. Zeus, where are you? C'mon, Zeus! Zeus! Zeus? Zeus? Lost the dog. Great. My new neighbor's gonna think I've shanghaied his dog and fed him to the sharks. Zeus?! Zeus?! C'mon. Oh, my gosh. C'mere! Get the camera. I got it. 7:10, 2:15, Off location six. We have a canine Zeus, we have Roxanne. Woof, woof, woof! What are they doing? Talking to each other. They're communicating. They are talkin'. I think... We're witnessing Inter-species communication. Mary Beth. What? You're gonna get that Rockland Grant. Yes! I love this dog. I've always loved this dog From the minute I saw that dog. Linda, what have you got? Mother and calf. Mother and calf. Yes. Let's separate these two for the next 24 hours. Begin the sonar recognition test series And increase the volume of the masking sounds Until mother and calf can no longer communicate. The baby needs to feed. "the baby needs to feed." The sacrifice is for the good for all mankind. For science. Yeah, for Dr. Claude carver. Swing it around. You got it? Hold it steady. great submersible. Look at that. I could really use something like that. How'd you get it? Oh, I pulled a few strings. Perhaps you'd like to take her down sometime. Oh, yeah, sure! Solo. I keep telling you Two keen scientific minds are better than one. Yes, but neither are any good Without the essential ingredient. What might that be? Heart. Sure. Hey, hey! I'll drop kick you from here to Miami! no, you will not. C'mon, Zeus, let's get outta here. Phil, get my bag, will you? There you go. You deserve it. let's go! Great. Okay, so let me get this straight. You don't want us to have any fun over the Summer. I don't want you hanging out with borderlines. Craig isn't borderline, mom. And ditching your enrichment classes. Well, we're just- We were just- Rescheduling. Yes, right. Grounded. This block, one week. Oh, no, mom. Zeus! Zeus. Where'd you guys find him? Actually he found me, and you are? I'm Jordan Barnett. I'm with him. I see you and Zeus have become friends. Well, miracles sometimes happen. What's that? Some photos I took this morning. What? I can't believe- Oh, my God! charming. Looking good, mom! Working on two weeks. Here. Your house has a satellite dish, doesn't it? Yeah. Mom? Okay, but not all the channels. C'mon, Zeus! Your dog was on the boat with me all day. Really? I'm sorry, I won't let that happen again. No, actually it sort of seemed to suit him. Really. I'd like to take him out again if - Sure, you can take him on a cruise to Antarctica, But he's Jordan's dog. Would you mind If I just ask him something? Go right ahead. Gimme that! Can I just watch this for a minute? Girls, girls, time out. Where's Jordan? In there. What are you watching? hello. Oh, hi. Hi, can I come in? Yeah, sure. "braveheart". Wow! Did you do all these? Yeah. That one's gonna be the cover for my dad's opera score. Your dad writes opera? It's a rock opera. Most of the time he does music For commercials and really tall elevators. It's only to pay the bills. we have now brought the psychic friends network... Love that satellite dish, huh? This is gonna sound really lame, But we don't even have one TV in our house. We're like a media impaired family. Oh. Hey, is this your mom? Yeah... She died. Sorry to hear that. You must miss her a lot. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. I think Zeus is a very special dog. What do you mean? Well... I think that Zeus is capable of- Inter-species communication. What's the big deal? I talk to Zeus all the time. Ah, But Zeus is talking with my dolphin. You own a dolphin? I don't own her, Roxanne lives in the bay, But I kinda take care of her. She used to live in a tank. We're reintroducing her into the ocean. Now the problem is, That she doesn't really take to other dolphins. But she seems to like your Zeus. So I was thinking, It might be really interesting To get the two together, Zeus and Roxanne, And just see how things go from there. What do you think? Well, this has to be Zeus' decision. Alright. So, Zeus, would you like to go out with Roxanne? Woof, woof! Is that a "yes"? Woof! Yeah. Great. You like our mom? Yeah, sure I do. Enough to go out with her? How 'bout Saturday? Alright. It's okay. Okay, new behavior. That's it. What is she doing out there with that dog? Havin' fun. No. I'll tell you what she's doing. She's trying to steal my grant. That's just not gonna happen. No, sir! Hey, watch where you're going! I was and I am. You're driving too fast. There are kids around. Oh, I'm sorry. I was in a hurry to visit with Miss Dunhill. Apparently so were you, And failed to look both ways before crossing the street. Thank God for anti-lock brakes. What are you doing here? These are the manuals for the submersible. It's yours whenever you want it. Really? invite me in, I'll go over them with you. Alright. Terry, did you need something? Oh, no, it's not important. Alright. Never is. So, this is a surprise. It is? Bye, mom. We're goin' for a test ride. I thought you two were grounded. Just around the block. With Zeus and Jordan. Please, mom? Come on mom! One block. I love you! Thank you, mommy. Bye, mom! You should think about boarding school for those two. Now, where were we? The catch. No catch. Boy. This is it? This is it. I don't know about this. Woof, woof! Hey, get out of there! This is definitely getting out of hand. Okay, hold it right there. Judith? What's going on? Judith and Nora are getting busted. This is probably their first offense. I can probably get them off with a stern warning. Mm-hmm. C'mon. So, am I to believe That cute little dog and your dolphin Are actually talking? Incessantly. Wow. I have all this communication skills data on file. Perhaps you might wanna reconsider About pooling our research And applying for that Rockland Mammal Grant together? The catch! What, what catch? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I already applied for my grant. But thanks for the mini sub. It was very unselfish of you. Hey, thanks for talking deputy dog Out of serious jail time. You're welcome, youngster. What's the catch? Probably a lecture, right, Jordan? No, he's not too good at those. But, I'm gonna try. that's it, all off who are gettin' off! Just around the block? Do you two girls even know what time it is? Yeah. It's time for the marlins-reds game. Huh? On your satellite dish. It's been real! did I miss something? Tell me they weren't robbing a bank? They weren't robbing a bank. Thank you. They're still talking? Probably busting us. Not Terry. Give me those! I can read lips. "live to ride." "ride to live." A way of life. "a way of life"? That's just a logo they use to sell the bike. Who cares about reading lips? I'm reading body language. And they are talking a mile a minute. Oh, yeah. What are they saying? She's asking him out. no way. Way. Woof, woof! Whoa. Okay. You can- Right. it was a teen-age wedding and the old folks wished them well we could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle Wow. Killer. Cool, mom. See, mom? You can look good when you try. Dad. Yes. Terrence Barnett. It won't bite. c'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell they had a hi-fi phono Put your feet on. If you'd like, you can hang onto the back Or you can put your hands around my waist. Okay. Whatever you like. Jordy, you listen to Mrs. Rice, okay?! Yes, father, sir! You okay? Woof, woof! We are good. c'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell we think you spend too much time alone, Jordan. We've gotta do something about it. Oh, he put it- I don't know how to play poker. That's okay, Jordan, we'll teach you. The main thing you need to know Is you have to bet something. But I don't have any money. That's okay, too. I'm sure we can think of something. Maybe we can bet chores? Chores! What kind of chores? Stuff your parents make you do around the house So they feel you're useful. You know, chores. I do all the chores around here. You won't have to. If you win, that is. Deal. This Claude guy- Do you see him? Every day. Oh, really? Really and unfortunately. He's the head honcho at the institute. I used to be his assistant, But we had a parting of the ways. Oh. Would it be tactless to ask over what? Third party. Oh, I apologize, never mind- A dolphin. "a dolphin." I happened to think that the dolphin Was more important than his career. I agree. hey, c'mon, join us! C'mon! You have three of a kind. That's excellent. Yeah, but I have the two of clubs. Two of clubs beats anything. Sorry, man. Gonna have to clean my room for a month. sorry. Whoa! Let's see, Jordan, you've got tens and jacks. That's two pair. That's real good- But, I have a three, a five, A seven, a Jack and a Queen. Cutthroat straight. That beats you, sorry. You're gonna have to water our plants for... Two weeks. We better get going. We will... Eventually. You said that dolphins are telepathic. How about people? Some people. Your bet. Double or nothing. I'm your slave for the rest of the Summer Or we're back to even. You sure? I like to live on the edge. Well, you just crashed and burned. I have a straight flush. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. And you know what? This is the two of clubs. No. How'd you do that? It's all in the wrist. I had a great time. You sound surprised. I am. I mean, no, no, no, Please, I don't mean That I'm surprised that I had a good time. I'm... For... She's really into it. give him a break, he's a little Rusty. More than a little. Yes! Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof! Hey! Shh! Shut up! Get outta here! You get, get! Get out! Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it! Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof! Zeus! Zeus? Damn. Okay, here I come. Zeus. What are you doing? Okay, You're a weird dog. It's the creature from the black lagoon. Yeah, dressed like Dr. Carver. Get me a towel! Creature, sir! I think they hear you. That's where Roxanne should be. With them. Cool fish. I think you've got yourself a band. Good job, mates! Rehearsal tomorrow, same place, same time! Everybody sober! You know dolphins. Yeah. I don't wanna lose you, Terry. I don't wanna lose me either. When are you leaving? I gotta go to Boca Raton... For a week, mix my tracks, Then it's off to Boston And a regular job, Jordan's in school. How 'bout you? I'm here through the Summer if I get my grant. And if you don't get the grant? Minnesota aquarium tour guide. Ugh! Mary Beth won't share, will she? Neither will I! Inter-species communication. I'll show her inter-species communication! Let's start with her. She looks sickeningly cute enough. See ya. See ya. I'd like to thank you. Really, for what? 'cause we're going down in the sub? I should be thanking you. No, I mean thanks for helping Terry. He hasn't been able to write in a long time. Roxannes so graceful. oh, cool. uh-oh, drift nets. They kill thousands of dolphins every year. Where do they come from? Illegal fishermen. C'mon, let's lead Roxanne outta here. we're gonna have to leave next week. There's a new family moving in. You could stay at our house. What about my dad? we have two extra rooms. Perfect. Hey girls, what brings you here? You've burned the school down. Then, why are you here? Thank you. Thank you. This looks good. Thank you. Okay, why are you two eating salads? You always eat salad, mom. Why can can't we eat salad? I'm sorry, no satellite dish. They're too expensive, we can't afford it- No, mom, it's not a satellite dish. It's really that Terry and Jordan Need a place to live for a while. We want them at our house. We have two extra rooms. Yeah, c'mon, mom. Whoa, whoa. Why do you think they're even interested in staying at our house? Well, Jordan does. And so does Terry. Says who? Jordan told us. He told us lots of stuff. Curious to know, mom? What exactly did they say? Okay, well- It started out... The rest of the Summer? You sure this was Mary Beths idea? And where are my Twinkies?! I made you a fruit salad. It's in the refrigerator. And of course, it was her idea. You're sure. Absolutely. And dad, use a spoon? Mm-hmm. Right here, I knew that. Now, before we do this, There's a few things you gotta know about me. Uh-oh. You one of these guys that howls at the full Moon? I'm afraid so. Oh, dear. It's a little late to be reticent now. After all, this was your idea. My idea? Mm-hmm. Jordan said it was- Jordan said it was your idea for- No, the girls told me that you said- No, I- We've been set up. By world-class professionals. Well? What are we gonna do, professor? Well... I suppose... If you stayed that I could continue my work with Zeus. Mm-hmm, and... I could finish my second act. So, I guess we'll just have to Make the best of it. Man, we're good. Woof, woof! Should I take this stuff next door now? Just put it outside first. Why? 'cause I said so. Jeesh! Lemonade? No, thank you. What happened? Nothing. What didn't happen? Jordan? It's gone south. What are we doing this for? Are we doing this for us? Are we doing this for the Rockland foundation? Are we doing it for the kids? What? All of the above. I don't know. I don't know. It's okay, just- Take as much time as you need. it's time to go, Zeus. I don't understand. If a dog and a dolphin can get along Why can't our mom and his dad? Woof, woof! Zeus, please. I feel badly enough. Then why don't you turn around? I wish I could. I don't see anyone else driving. Jordan! Hey, good morning, boss. Hey, you alright? What's wrong? They're gone. So is Zeus. They're just gone. Men and dogs, huh? C'mere. It's okay. Oh. I could almost cry. Tears of Joy. That dolphin is fair game now, Track her. C'mon, Zeus. Zeus, c'mon. Zeus. C'mon. What is she doing? I don't know. She's running away. She won't let us near her anymore. So much for inter-species communication. That's what happens When you work with these animals in the wild. They can walk out on you whenever they want to. If we can bring Roxanne back into the lab- Dr. Carver, It's illegal to catch a dolphin in the open sea. Excuse me, Phil. You know he's right. I'll replace Roxanne with one of the simpletons, Perhaps even two. As scientists we have to circumvent These ridiculous bureaucratic regulations. Girls, dinner! Feeding time at the enrichment program. I resent that. Why do you treat us like your little Einsteins? What do you mean? Did your parents ever send you To an enrichment program? No. C'mon, mom, it's the Summer. Enjoy it! You're right. I guess I'm just trying to rush everything too much. I'm trying to rush you into being little adults, I'm rushing Roxanne back to the wild. Probably rushing Terry into I don't know what. Oh, no, mom, We'll take Some of the blame for Terry. Actually, mom... We'll take most of the blame. alright, all of the blame. I was so close. I was so close To reintroducing Roxanne into a pod. And then- What happened to Roxanne? She's gone. She'll be back, don't worry. No, she won't. She misses Zeus too much. Mom. Zeus! Zeus! Hello? It's me. Yes? I see. anything? Nope, nothing. I just know he's trying to go back. That is unbelievable. That's like scary. I think it's time to take Jurassic measures. I agree. What do we have to lose? Alright, who is that? Hi. Can you please hold on a second? Dad. It's for you, mom. Who is it? It's Jane freeman From the record company. It's somebody selling cemetery plots. Mom, get the phone. Hello? Hello, gorgeous. I had a dream about you last night. You did? Oh, yeah. We went all the way, positively platinum. Oh. I had a dream about you too last night And we went resoundingly tin. Hello, Terry. They don't give up too easily, do they? No, they do not. I heard about Zeus. I heard about Roxanne. She's pretty hurt. So is he. I mean, I think she'll get over it. Maybe... We can give it a little more time. We'll talk. Yeah. Tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow would be great. Alright. Okay. Bye. Hello? Hello? Goodbye. Okay, bye. Hello. Alright, you hang up first. Mm-mm. How 'bout we hang up together? I'll say bye And on one, two, three, we hang up. Okay, bye. One, two, Three. Hello? She hung up on me. Breakfast. Jordy! I woke up and I wanna smell the coffee! Jordy? hi, dad, it's me. I've gone to look for Zeus. Hi, dad, it's me. I've gone to look for Zeus. the white zone is for Loading and unloading of passengers... Oh, shoot. Hello. Mary Beth, it's Becky. I know it's Sunday but I thought you should know about this. Know what? I came to the office to check up on a few things and- And what, Becky? Claude carver was just in. He said they found a dolphin caught in drift nets... Dead. It's not Roxanne. I've gotta find her, Becky. Right. No more Mr. Nice guy. Look who's back. Now Roxanne is ours. No, Dr. Carver. Yours. We quit. No, you don't. You're fired! We got a date with a dolphin. Excuse me, sir! How would you like to be part of scientific history?! Can I interest you in a case of rum? Enjoy your flight. Next in line. do you have standby? What? Do you have standby? And do you have a good reason for being here? Uh-oh. Take us to 0-3-5 full throttle! This mongrel is the perfect bait! Roxanne will come to us! Yes! We got her! Ah, my foot! You know, Jordy, We're gonna do everything we can to find Zeus But it's extremely unlikely he made it down here. Dad, Zeus is an extremely extreme dog. That he is. he's also in love. an extreme emotion. Why don't you try it sometime, dad? It's okay. Jordan! Jordan! C'mon! Cab's waiting. Let's go. Mind if I tag along? C'mon! Becky. There's something you should know. It's about Dr. Carver. Hey, girls, Terry, What are you guys doing here? Where's my mom? Her boat's gone. She's out looking for Roxanne. C'mon, Roxanne. Ready the net. Ready... Now! You missed, you idiot! Get it back up! Get it up, fool! C'mon, move, move! Get me out! You stupid dog. Mom? Mom! mom! Mom! flags up, she's down in the sub. How long can she stay down there? 45 minutes I think. Roxanne. yes, Roxanne. I think she wants you to follow her. Get me a knife! You okay? Roxanne. c'mon! good dog, yes, yes, That's a good dog. No! you mongrel! Stay, stay. What are you doing? No, no, no! Officer, arrest this dog! Oh, we will. Free Dr. Carver, and then arrest him. I confess, it was all him! What are you talking about, you idiot?! I'll kill you! Atta boy, Zeus. I'm waiting! How do you like your new neighbors? I liked the old ones better. I'm gonna take a shower. I'm gonna make some coffee. Don't do that again, okay? We believe that with all that's happened It's clearly established that You do like our mom. Of course I do. Enough to marry her? How 'bout next Sunday? Where do you keep the coffee? At this point, if there's anyone here That has any reason that this marriage Between Mary Beth Dunhill and Terrence Paul Barnett Shall not take place, Speak now or forever hold your peace. wait! Wait! Sorry, they told me to bring this down here right away. Better offer? It's the grant! good going, Mary Beth- I mean mom. Now I suppose you can kiss the bride. What's going on? I think... He's telling her it's time. Go on, girl. It's your turn.
