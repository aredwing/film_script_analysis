Who am I? Standing on a rock Staring at the sun Saying who am I My, my, my, my, yeah I had a dream What does it mean? Why do I dream at all? I'm looking back Stop, heart attack Catch me before I fall Who am I? And who am I? Standing on a rock staring at the sun Saying who am I My, my, my, my My, my, my, my, my yeah And here's Dakota Rose! She will now move into a series of vaults. There's one and back on board! Let's give her a hand, folks! Oh, that's a hard fall, folks! Let's hope she's okay. Now how about some energy? Let's help her up! My name is Dakota Rose. You'd think that my being the granddaughter of rodeo legend Austin Rose... Would make me a great trick rider myself. But so far, that's clearly not working out. Yep, times were challenging for the Sweethearts, and I wasn't exactly helping. I lost my foothold. That's all. I told you to make that foothold looser. - Why didn't you listen to me? - Because you're my sister, not my coach. Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a big welcome to the Lone Stars... Captain Dawn Morton and Julia Reneau. There she is, God's gift to the rodeo world. Be nice, Miss Madison. I am being nice. Broken tactics Gettin' out the fact sheets I've done statistics Blink And you'll miss it Boom-boom, boom Don't mind knowing the score But I can't deal with this no more I'm gonna have to lay down the law - She never makes a mistake. - Well, she's pretty good. You can't watch sport round my place no more Y'all see that? That is how you trick ride. You obviously haven't heard of a concept called modesty. I say if you got it, you might as well flaunt it. I say the next time we ride against each other... you're going down. Good luck with that, princess. You've been eating my dust since grade school. I owned you then, and I own you now. Forget about her. - So what's with them? - It's so stupid. They used to be best friends in fourth grade, and then Dakota booked the lead in the school play. She got to play a princess and Dawn... played a frog. Dawn never really got over it. Well, she would make a good frog. Relax. Come on. You're ready for this. Are we ready to show 'em what we got, girls? Put your hands together and welcome the Sweethearts of the Rodeo! Right there, wouldn't it be easier for the girls to do a Triple Wedding Ring? If they did the Triple, they wouldn't be able to do the Four Leaf Clover. Everybody knows that's the stronger trick. I doubt everyone knows that, actually. What do you know? You're just a bull rider with 10 cracked ribs. I got the best of that bull. Don't you worry about me. The way I look at it, we owe that bull, 'cause we got some cheap part-time help. All right, folks, I wanna remind you to join us in a few months... for the Buttercup Challenge Finals. A lot of the young ladies you saw riding here in today's trial competition... will be there for the big one. And as we lead into the second day of competition tomorrow, it looks like the Lone Stars are in first place. Congratulations, ladies. And way to go, Stars! They are not better than us. Well, these are just the prelims. We've got two months before the finals. Come on. Let's pack it up. - You need to check Silver's right front shoe. - I know that. I'm just looking out for you 'cause you're my little sister. Maybe it's time to face the fact that you and I are both very different. Yeah. You don't know the half of that. Hey. Any news from Nicole? Not for a couple weeks now. - But she's real busy. - Yeah. Well, I guess you're just gonna have to hang in there. That's what I'm doing. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Nice and early. Yes, ma'am. What does that mean, what you said back there? What? I said we're different. You said, "You don't know the half of it." - I don't remember saying that. - Trust me, you did. Does it have to do with the fact... - that we don't look like each other? - We look like each other. Blake, do we look like each other? - Not even close. - See? A lot of sisters don't look like each other. Not in the way that we don't look like each other. Just let it go, okay? You're hiding something from me. I can feel it. Kristen! What do you want me to say? I want you to say the truth, whatever it is. All right. Mom and Dad and I should have told you this a long time ago. You're adopted. What? Why didn't you guys tell me this? It happened when you were a baby. Grandpa had something to do with it. But other than that, I don't know anything else. Dakota! Hi, sweetie. You okay? Honey, you were a beautiful little baby. Three weeks old when we got you. It was an amazing day. When you got here, we knew you belonged with us. - We wanted to tell you a long time ago- - We did. But the years went by and... we didn't have the head... or the courage. You were our miracle. You know, we just never wanted you to feel any different. I know tons of people who are adopted... and it's no big deal. But you guys have lied to me my whole life. - Dakota! - Dakota, honey. Come on, now. Come on. Let's go. Let me help you. You take it easy out there today. Just a couple of basic tricks, all right? Ladies and gentlemen, give a big round of applause... to Dakota Rose. Ladies and gentlemen, give a big round of applause to Dakota Rose. There is a little cowgirl with a whole lot of spunk. - Nice fall, Dakota. - Am I missing something? Or isn't the rider supposed to stay on the horse? Truth is, the only reason she's on the Sweethearts... is because she's Austin Rose's granddaughter. Oops, not anymore. You little troll! - How dare you! - What happened to you? You used to be so nice, and now you're the Wicked Witch of the West. - It doesn't make any sense. - You better watch your back, Dakota. I'm not afraid of you. Come on. She's not worth it. What has gotten into you? I know it was wrong, but she deserved it. You can't just stoop to her level, Dakota. You gotta take the high road. I can't! Dakota. We feel that you need to take some time off from the Sweethearts... to think about what's really important to you. It's not fair. Dakota, we do believe in you. You know, you say that, but I feel like you guys don't. I feel like everyone's against me. - Honey, you can't just leave. - Then what am I supposed to do? This is all your fault because you lied to me. Where exactly are you gonna go? The middle of nowhere sounds pretty good to me. Why don't you visit your grandparents? They're not even my real grandparents anymore! Your grandfather needs help running the ranch. Honey! That's the last place on earth where I wanna go... but this is the last place where I want to be. Why are you Crying? Because you're my baby girl. - We'll see you soon. - Yeah. You have fun. - See ya. - Bye. I'll be traveling far from home But I won't be looking for to roam I'll be crossing o'er the great divide In a better home soon I will reside Hallelujah Hallelujah Oh, Dakota! Look at you! Oh. Oh, we're so glad you're here. We've got all kinds of good things planned. Hey. - How was your trip? - It was fine. F.Y.I., just so we don't have to pretend, I know you guys aren't my real grandparents. We know you know. And we want you to know it doesn't make any difference to us. You guys started raising miniature horses? Cute, aren't they? Home again, home again. I put some white chicken chili in the slow cooker, and I'm gonna make some biscuits. And I did some peach cobbler for dessert. Sounds good to me. Do you know who my real parents are? Oh, sweetie. Perhaps it's best if you just get on with your life. We're just saying that some doors are better left unopened. You need to be fair with me. That's all I'm asking. So what am I supposed to do here? Well, you'll be helping out with the minis, and, uh, there'll be chores around the ranch. And when we have visitors, you can help out with them. Visitors? Yeah. A couple of times a week we have some troubled kids come over. It helps for them to spend time around the horses. Troubled kids? Yeah. The last thing I wanna do right now is baby-sit some messed-up kid. I know exactly how you feel. Here. You can take Jupiter out to that paddock. Take him to that young man out there. Yeah, bring her on out here. Howdy. I'm Bryce Tucker. - Do you have a name? - Yes, I do. - Well, I reckon I'll see you around then. - Not if I can help it. You like that one? One-Foot Flyaway? I almost did it once. - Did you? - Yep. That's a challenging trick. You got all your weight supported by just one leg. The other leg straight back, your arm forward. Going 40 miles an hour on a horse ups the degree of difficulty considerably. My daddy always said a One-Foot Flyaway took the grace of a ballerina... and the strength of a steer wrestler. I always wondered why I wasn't a better trick rider... considering I was your granddaughter and all. But now that I'm not, I guess it makes sense. Well... my daddy was just about the most uncoordinated man in the world. He couldn't dance. He could barely get up on a horse. But, oh, how he could sing. When he opened his mouth and sang... you would've thought an angel himself had come down to the world to entertain us. Beautiful. And as for me? Well, I cannot sing a lick. And your point is? You tell me. Well, obviously, it doesn't matter what your parents did... as far as what you can do. It's not about blood. It's about heart. - Oh, and Dakota? - Yeah? F.Y.I... I will always be your grandfather. "Miniature horses are exactly like normal horses, just smaller. Miniature horses have been bred over the last 500 years. Small horses and ponies had been used to work in coal mines... in England and Holland. Some of these were brought to the United States in the 19th century." Yes? It sounds like you don't even like miniature horses. I do like them. Seems like you're just phoning it in. Just sayin'. - What's your name? - Summer. Okay, Summer. When I want your little opinion, I'll ask for it, okay? Okay. Okay, let's go to the pens. All right, so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take the halter, you're gonna put it around the neck like this... and then you click it on, all right? So everybody's gonna grab a halter, go in the pen and find a mini. Let's have some fun! Don't be afraid, guys. Talk to 'em. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't chase 'em. Don't chase 'em. Walk slow, walk slow. Yeah, wrap it around, clip it. Hey, come back here. There you go. Hey, buddy. How you doing? There you go! Way to go, Summer! - What's this one's name? - Oh, his name's Jupiter. Oh, I like him. Hi, buddy. Cute, huh? - Good job, guys. Come on! - We got new friends. - Thank you, Austin. - Our pleasure, Ms. Judd. - We'll see you in a few days. - All right. Bye, Dakota. That little girl is such a brat. Did you hear her? "Sounds like you don't even like miniature horses." Oh, I wouldn't be so quick to judge her. Sometimes, underneath a bratty exterior there beats a heart of gold. I know you're talking about me when you say that. You think so? So why are you "troubled"? Well, obviously, I'm not troubled. I just live in a foster home. Why do you live in a foster home? Well, if you really wanna know, my parents are overseas in Africa, working with the Peace Corps. Really? I know it doesn't make sense... and they're not perfect... but they really do love me. What about you? What are your parents like? My parents? Hey, what are you doing? Uh, nothing. Have a nice day. Okay. You too. - Can I help you? - Yes. I'm looking for James Tilman. Can I ask what this is regarding? - I'm a relative. - Okay. Please just have a seat over there. Hi, there's a girl out here who's asking to see James Tilman. Okay. Thank you. I'm so sorry, but Mr. Tilman passed away three years ago. Oh. Are you all right? Is there anything I can do for you? - Did you know him? - I did. - Was he a nice man? - He was. Everybody really liked him. Thank you, sir. Watch out! Man, didn't anyone ever teach you to look both ways before you cross the street? What are you doing here? Are you stalking me? No. I ain't stalking you. I just-I thought you might need some help. - I'm fine. - Really? Yeah. You look like you've just seen a ghost. What happened? I thought it'd be good to know who my real parents are... because that would tell me something about myself, right? But if that man truly is my father, then I'm three years too late. Well, I believe everything happens for a reason. Even if it doesn't seem so at the time. Yeah, well, I guess maybe some doors are Better left unopened. You like the rodeo? It's okay, I guess. I was thinking maybe we could go to the rodeo... since the Sweethearts are gonna be performing. If you want to. Not a bad idea. Maybe we could have a barbecue afterwards for everyone. She smiles. And a pretty one at that. Well, don't think I'm happy or anything, because I'm not. Okay, I won't. I have an old friend I want you to meet. Come on. - This is Jessie. - Hi, Jessie. Jessie here is a champion trick-riding horse. Hey, boy. How are you? He's basically retired, but... there's still a little something left in the tank, so... I was thinking maybe you'd like to ride him. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. You and I were made for each other Like stars and night - Go, Dakota! - Dakota! - Yeah. - Yeah. - That's good! - Nice! When I looked at you Saw my whole life before me Right then I knew we'd trade in the small town for something new Take my hand leave the rest in the Buy and Sell You make me want to run like hell and never look back I was hanging on the top of the horse, and they were running everywhere! You might just fall off, but it's okay! Go, go! You make me wanna run Whoo! - Right out the gate - Faster! Kickin' at dirt 'cause we couldn't wait Jump in, let's head for the interstate - Whoo, yeah! - With you by my side - I've got all I'll ever need, baby - Good. Good. You make me wanna run like hell and never look back - Whoo! - Attagirl! You and Jessie go good together, I gotta say. Yeah. You know, I really don't know anything about you. There's not much to know. Tell me something I should know about you. I like rhubarb pie. - You like rhubarb pie? - Uh-huh. A la mode. That is so uninteresting. - You're a dork. - Oh, thank you. I think this is her. I called this number earlier. Who? Hello? Hi. Yeah, I can meet tomorrow. Okay. Bye. I think I'm gonna meet my mom tomorrow. That's great. Thanks for the lift. No problem. Just let me know when you wanna be picked up. Well, wish me luck. You'll be fine. Hello, I'm Annie. Dakota. - This is weird. - This is so weird. - Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you too. Well, you're so skinny I should feed you. Come on. - Here we are, ladies. - Thank you. My birthday's November 26, '96. If you are Austin Rose's granddaughter and you know you were adopted... I think you have to be her. Seems like it. Yeah. Wow. I didn't always make the best choices with my life, but I have tried to learn from my mistakes. I don't seem to learn from my mistakes. It seems like the older I get, the more I make. Oh, don't worry. You'll get the hang of it. I do feel like I'm getting a new start to my life, though. So much has changed in the past three weeks, it feels like three months. I just love that feeling of getting a fresh start, you know, like you can just fly over the horizon... and find new friends, adventures. It's never too late to reinvent yourself. That's what I always say. - I really like your necklace. - You do? I'm obsessed with turquoise. Me too. It's my favorite stone. - Really? - See? Yeah. Well, then why don't you take this? - Are you sure? - Sure. I'd like for you to have it. - Thank you. - Oh, it looks beautiful. Oh, shoot! You know, I don't have much time today. Can we meet up again soon, continue getting to know each other? Yeah. I'd like that. Me too. Okay. What an amazing day... to meet my daughter as a grown-up, beautiful young woman. Oh. Thank you, Annie. All right, sweetheart, you be good. Yeah, you've been eating a lot of this, haven't you? You're so cute. You want some? I'm going to the market. You wanna come? Sure. Okay. I actually met my birth mom yesterday. - Really? - Yeah. - What's she like? - She was nice. She took me to a really fancy restaurant for lunch, and... gave me a necklace. Cool. What's the deal with your parents? Beats me. I mean, I haven't seen 'em in three years. - Because they're overseas? - Because they're M.I.A. I thought you said they were in the Peace Corps. I said that they could be in the Peace Corps. But it doesn't matter. They don't care about me... and they probably have pets that they love more than me. Do you wanna go to a rodeo with me this weekend? Sure. Sounds like fun. - Hey! - Hi, sis. Austin! How's my friend? I'm doing fine. It's good to see you. It's good to see all of you. - Hey, darling. - Hi, Grandpa. - What's this? - Just a little something from all of us... to let you know we missed you. That's really sweet, you guys. Okay. Stop. If this is how you show you guys miss me, I'd rather you not miss me. What are you doing out here all by yourself? What's up? Well, I just got a text from Nicole. Oh, yeah? What's she up to? She met someone. She did? Yeah. Some guy on her tour. Hmm. Well, I don't know what to say... except she's an idiot. She did it over text? That's cold. I've just never been dumped before. Well, I've been dumped more times than I can count. Is that why you're so grumpy? I'm not grumpy. Well. Anyway, getting dumped will teach you humility, build character, and... it'll remind you that even though you're so attractive... you gotta have other stuff going on. You know, which you do. Thanks, I think. Cowboy, you just gotta get back in the saddle. There's plenty of other fillies in the sea. I think you mean "fish." Whatever. Fish, fillies, you know what I mean. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Bluebonnet Rodeo. Please make them welcome, the Sweethearts of the Rodeo drill team! Step on the gas Step on the gas I gotta be somewhere I'm runnin' up It's goin' good They can do nothin' but stop and stare I'm in a rush, rush I'm livin' so fast Maybe I ain't got time for tryin' They must think that I am crazy My foot is to the floor My ambition's out the door I'm goin' at full steam I thought you were retired. No. I'm just up here training with my grandfather. - Why don't you just face the fact that- - Just stop. Okay? Instead of just dissing each other, which you have to admit is getting pretty old... how about we just settle this in the arena? - Go on. - Well, the next time we compete, if you win, I have to wear a Stars T-shirt every day for a month. It can say anything you want on it. And in the very unlikely scenario that you win? We have to put all this behind us... and become friends again. Wait, like "hang out, go to the movies, text each other all the time" kind of friends? Okay. You've got a deal. What size T-shirt do you wear? And here's Dawn Morton, who's over the neck. How do you like that as she makes her way around? Here's Julia Reneau... with the Full-Shoulder Stand! It's gonna be Dawn Morton with the Back Breaker! How do you like that? Hold her up by her knee, with her hands dragging the ground. Put your hands together for the Lone Stars! And here's Kristen Rose. Come on, Kristen! With the Stroud Layout!

I don't know, I guess he is. Come on. He's cute. Almost like I never left at all I brought you some lemonade. Look at you, all dolled up. Heck, yeah. It's a party. - No sulking. - Okay. To the next chapter. The next chapter. Where the door is open wide Oh. - What? - Annie's here. I invited her. - Who's Annie? - She's my birth mom. You found your birth mom and you invited her here to Grandpa's ranch? Yeah. It's home Small town and big hearts You're never too far - Everyone, this is my birth mom, Annie. - Hi. - That is what I call you, right? - Yeah, sure, whatever you want. This is my sister, Kristen. - It's nice to meet you, Kristen. - Nice to meet you too. - This is Summer. - Hi. Look at you! Who feels like dancing? Here's a little song called "Cotton-Eyed Joe." Oh, "Cotton-Eyed Joe." - Wanna dance? - Absolutely! I need a dance partner. Come on. If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd have been married a long time ago Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd have been married a long time ago Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? Whoo! He rode into town and made me believe He'd spent half his life just a-lookin' for me I thought he loved me But boy, I was wrong 'Cause he had his fun then we were over and done Keep on dancin' I'll tell you the tale About a tall, dark fiddler with eyes so pale With a look he hooked every girl in town Makin' any other man just another rebound I heard the story Thought it couldn't be true Till he rode through here back in '02 He broke my heart, and he stole my soul Makin' me another victim of Cotton-Eyed Joe If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd have been married a long time ago Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd have been married a long time ago Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? Cotton-Eyed Joe Where did you go? Cotton-Eyed Joe Cotton-Eyed Joe Sweetheart, I'll be right back, okay? Austin. - What are you doing here? - Dancing. It's a nice band. You can't just come waltzing into her life after 17 years. I was invited. She doesn't know anything about you. I do. That's all in the past, old man. I've moved on with my life. Obviously, you haven't. And you can't control me, or her. If we want to have a relationship, you got no say. Just like we had no say the night you dumped her- Stop it. I don't want you guys to argue. All right, we're done arguing. 'Cause I'm leaving. We'll talk soon. Dakota. Leave me alone. I'm sorry that happened. But there are some things you don't understand, some things you don't know about. Then why don't you just tell me? Okay. Back before you were born, I knew Annie... because she had worked for me on and off over the years. Annie is good-hearted but irresponsible. I hadn't seen her for a while, but... I had heard she was pregnant. Then one rainy night, I got a call from her. She wanted me to meet her in a parking lot. She had a tiny baby with her and she begged me to take the baby. She said she couldn't care for her. She said if I couldn't take the baby, she would leave the baby on the courthouse steps. So I took you. I drove over to Richard and Clara's house, and I carried you inside. You were babbling and cooing like you didn't have a care in the world. When I asked Richard and Clara... if they'd be interested in raising you... well, they didn't hesitate. They committed that night... to love you and to take care of you forever. Now. Annie and your father, they officially gave up all of their parenting rights, and she agreed to stay away. But people can change. Annie could be a different person now. I do believe that people can change. And I hope that we all can. But sometimes people don't. Now, you have every right to find your birth mother... and to have a relationship with her. I just want you to be careful. Thank you for taking care of me that night. And for all the time since. It has been my great pleasure. - Looks like you'll be staying here a while. - Yeah, just for a bit. - I love you. I love you too. - I'll miss you. - Have fun. - Thanks. - See you later, Bryce. All right. - You drive safe, now. - Okay, Cheryl. You got it. - You got everything? Good to go. You sure you don't wanna follow us home? - Hey, we could use a coach. - I'm retired. Last thing you need is an old dinosaur like me. Actually, I was thinking that an old dinosaur might be exactly what we need. - Isaac, are you trying to sweet-talk me? - Would I do that? All right, y'all! Let's get on the road. Hey, you wanna take the lead? I ain't going with y'all. Why not? I'm gonna take a detour and see if Nicole wants to talk about things. Oh. You sure you want to do that? Right now, it feels like I have to. Besides, my ribs are feeling better. It's almost time for me to rejoin the circuit. Okay, well... - I guess we'll see you when we see you. - Yeah. I'll look out for you always I'm gonna miss you. I'll look out for you always All right then. Like the moon shines in the dark I'll look out for you always - See you, Austin. - Bye-bye. What the hell are you kids doing? You're such a good boy. I brought you a treat. You like that little horse, don't you? More than anything, sir. He likes you too. You're such a good boy, aren't you? I love coming here. It's like going to a magical world, where everyone is kind... and everything's fun. I wish I wasn't graduating tomorrow. Well, after you graduate, we would be happy for you to come back and visit us anytime you want. Of course, Ms. Judd says it's best to not get used to this kind of life, 'cause we're never gonna live on a big ranch and raise minis... and have a lot of money and everything. Oh? And how does she know that? 'Cause no one wants older kids. That's pretty much common knowledge. - Hello? - Hey there, sweetie. I'm running some errands and I thought you might wanna hang out for a bit. Um, yeah, yeah. I guess I can. I have a couple of hours until the ceremony. Um, I'll meet you out on the road, okay? - Great. - Okay. Bye. - Hey! - Hey! All right. Girls' getaway! Whoo! - I'm excited! - Yeah, I know. Me too, honey. Get that corner. Tell me how you want these. Let's put 'em out on the table. - Here? - Yeah, that looks good. - Here we go. - We should do some over here too. You have to dry-clean silk. You cannot hand wash it. Even when they say you can on the Internet, it's... - Hey, can you just... - What's up? A hair appointment just opened up for me if we can get there in five minutes. - I thought we were hanging out. - We are hanging out. - I have to be back in one hour. - Don't worry. She's fast. Come on, smile. Don't be a sourpuss. All right, y'all. Ready for your big day? - Yeah! - This is gonna be fun. I have got to get a manicure. Yay! Okay, Annie. Sorry for the wait. I will be right back. Ella! - Where is she? - I don't know. She won't return my texts. Where's Dakota? - She'll be here. - She will. You know, she won't miss this for anything. I love it! I love it, I love it! Oh, my God. It's so chic! You look so good. And next up is Grant. - There you go, cowboy. - Thank you. And next is Summer. Way to go, Summer! Good job, Summer. Hey. You were an important part of the camp. And next up is Eric. Come on, Eric! - Oh, no. - "Oh, no," what? I forgot to fill this stupid thing up. You forgot to fill this thing up? How am I supposed to get to the ceremony? I don't know. It's not my fault. It's not your fault? I let someone important down today because of you and you don't even care. All you can say is, "It's not my fault." Like that lets you off the hook for being thoughtless and irresponsible, which by the way, seems to be a recurring pattern in your life! You can't speak to me that way, young lady. I am your mama! Biologically, yes. But in every other way... no. Just great. - I messed up. - You think so? She wouldn't let me go. I tried. Summer was counting on you being here. I know that. You don't need to lecture me. - You need to know. - You need to know that you're a jerk! You're a selfish jerk! Hey, you two. Jupiter's missing. So is one of the buggies. Bryce, you come with me. Summer, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm okay. I guess I'm quick to think that people are deserting me. I'm not deserting you. Okay? I won't. I'm counting on you to come visit me when I get home, okay? Okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. - Hi. - Hey. Where are you going? I have an opportunity in Arkansas, so I thought I'd go check that out. You weren't gonna say good-bye? After yesterday, I didn't think it was necessary. Look, sweetie. It's no secret I'm not the best mom material. I guess I've always known that. That's why I put you up for adoption. You put me up for adoption? Yeah, of course I did. Went down to the county courthouse and filled out all that paperwork. You know, uh, I think I've lived my whole life... thinking the grass is always greener just over the next hilltop, and you know what? What? It's not. Never was, never will be. But I... I can't seem to figure that out, no matter how hard I try. So I just keep running for the next hilltop... like some stupid wind-up toy. If I was gonna give you any piece of motherly advice, it would be to... Don't be that way. Okay. All right, well, I gotta get going. And, uh... I hope we can keep in touch. Me too. Sweetheart, I found some more pictures. Aw, look at that. Oh, my goodness. You lost both your front teeth at the exact same time. They both came out. And I swear, it was six months of that beautiful, cute smile. We just... We were just doing anything to make you laugh just so that we could see that. You could not say S's. You went... - Sunshine. - Mm-hmm. You wouldn't get off Sunshine. I think it was a solid month you rode. You just rode and rode and wouldn't get off. We were like, "Sunshine needs a rest, sweetheart." But you were so cute, my gosh. We knew right then and there... you were gonna be a cowgirl. Hey. Hi. - Oh, howdy. - Well, look who's back in town. I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team. - You think you're ready? - Yeah, I do. I've been working really hard. All right. Welcome back, Dakota. Pick it up! Get your lines tight! Let's go! Pick it up, Cheryl! Don't cut the corners! I'm sorry Taylor left. No need to be sorry. He's just out following his heart, which is something we all should be doing. Madison, I know you like him. I could tell when you guys were dancing. - That obvious, huh? - Yeah. I don't know if you wanna hear it or not, but I think he kind of likes you too. Boys can be dumb. I'm just starting to realize that. Okay, watch your spacing! Hi. Hi. Come in. - What are you doing here? - You said I could come. Uh, Mom, Dad, this is the girl that I was telling you guys about... who was gonna come visit, Summer Jennings. - Nice to meet you, Summer. - Nice to meet you too. - Good to meet you. - Glad to meet you too, sir. You just get dropped off? Uh, yes, ma'am, I did. I had a ride. Well, she's just in time for dinner. Isn't she, Mom? That's right. Well, come on in. Yeah? So my daddy works for a nonprofit organization... dedicated to help wild mustangs. He also volunteers at our church a lot. And my mama, she's an aerobics instructor. Her specialty is Zumba, but she also does do Bootcamp. I have two brothers and two sisters... and we sing together, we play together... and whenever we have a disagreement, we just talk it out. - We always end up in a big group hug. - Wow. You mind if I have some more mashed potatoes, ma'am? Oh, no, not at all. Help yourself. I reckon that'll do. - What are you doing here? - Ms. Judd's on vacation. And don't worry, I'll go back before she gets back. She'll never know I was gone. You did invite me. I know, but I didn't ask you to run away. Can you at least act like you're happy to see me? I am happy to see you! All right, so I'm gonna go get my stuff from the front porch. I'll go talk to my parents. All right. That's great, Dakota. Is she gonna be all right? Yeah, I think so. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right, but it looks like Buck's leg is hurt. Is she okay? Well, Dakota's okay, but Buck's come up lame. How bad is it? He won't be doing any trick riding for a while. What are we gonna do, Isaac? We'll figure something out. We always do. We can't catch a break. Howdy, this is Austin Rose. Leave a message, and I'll call you back. Hello. I'm a friend, and I just wanted to let you know... that Dakota's horse went lame and Taylor left, so the Sweethearts could sure use your help right now. And seeing as how you're a former champion trick rider and everything, I was wondering if you might wanna come and help them out. Like right away, sir. Bye, now. Nice, Rose. Get that leg up! You're too tense. Your leg has to be a shock absorber, Dakota. If you're tense, you can't absorb all the bumps. Thanks, Grandpa. Come on. Well, to what do we owe the honor of you being here? Well, retirement ain't all it's cracked up to be. And I figured this is where we need to be. "We"? I didn't think I'd see you again. I'm sorry for being so hard on you. I shouldn't have called you selfish. Actually, you called me a selfish jerk. But that's okay. I know I can be sometimes. I'm working on it. Come on. Come on. Is that Summer I see back there? Thanks for the phone call, Summer. You're welcome, sir. Okay. I know that you are a talented bunch of ladies, but winning takes more than talent. It takes dedication, hard work... and the will to be the best that you can possibly be... and the resolve to work harder and dig deeper than maybe you ever have... so that you know when you go out in that arena, you're gonna leave it all out there. - So are you ready for this? - Yeah! All right, let's go. Mount up, girls. Didn't your mama ever teach you how to crochet? No, I guess she never really had the time. A Half-Shoulder Stand, the hand is inverted, the left leg does the momentum. Now come back down into a Saddle Spin... and a Scissors. Attagirl. I'm just a blue jean girl pigtails and flip-flops Right? I didn't even put it in. Wait. Hey. I'm just a blue jean girl Whoa, a blue jean girl - There you go. - Whoo. What else could I possibly need? I'm just a blue jean girl pigtails and flip-flops Running around in cutoffs and tank tops It don't take much to fit into my world I'm just a blue jean girl pigtails and flip-flops Running around in cutoffs and tank tops That's right, nice and straight. Make sure you lock that knee. You want that leg as straight as you can get it. And keep it centered over the back of the horse. I'm just a blue jean girl Whoa, a blue jean girl I'm just a blue jean girl Whoa, a blue jean girl - You're back. - Yeah. Well, how'd everything go? Good. Did you get to talk to Nicole? Talk some sense into her? Well, I drove in that direction... but just kept driving. Did a lot of thinking. Thinking's always good. You ever think about how random life is? If that bull hadn't cracked my ribs, I wouldn't be standing here with you now. That's probably true. Then I thought... life's not random at all. It's not? No. The road leads you where you're always meant to be. For me, that's here with the Sweethearts... and you. You better not be messing with me. I never told you, but... the two guys that dumped me before ended up in the hospital. I wouldn't dare mess with you, Miss Madison. I'll look out for you always Seek out in my heart I'll look out for you always - She'll be comin' around the mountain when she comes - Toot, toot! She'll be comin' 'round the mountain... Uh-oh. What's going on? That's Ms. Judd's car. Summer. Summer. Wait. Wait, wait. I can get away! Please! We can go right now. If we leave right now, we can run away together, and we'll never have to go and they'll never know I was here. - Please! - No. We can't. - I can't go back there. - You have to be strong and face this. Hi. You didn't tell us that Summer ran away. You didn't ask. And Summer, all that about your family, all that was made up? Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry for lying to you. Come on, Summer. We have a long drive ahead. - I'm sorry for your trouble. - It's no trouble. It's all right. - But I don't wanna go. - I'm sorry, but we have to. Let's go. Come on. It's all right. - You just come on. - I don't wanna go. I know, I know. - But you have to. You can't run off... - Wait. Thank you for everything you've done for me, Dakota. - I'll never forget you. - No, this isn't the end. We're-We're gonna talk and e-mail. And I'll come visit you, okay? Okay. Come on. Ms. Judd. What if we raise her? Is that possible? Are you serious? - We're very serious, Ms. Judd. - It's true. They adopted me when I was three weeks old, and... they're the best parents in the world. You're talking a mountain of paperwork. Interviews, months and months of government bureaucracy. But the short answer is... it is possible. Go on. Oh, my goodness. The gate's open. Out he comes! There you are. Dawn wanted me to give you this... so you could wear it right after the competition. "I worship Dawn Morton, greatest trick rider in the world." And on the back: "Dawn Morton owns Dakota Rose." - There you go. - Thank you. See you in the arena. Wow. - I'll catch up with you. - All right. Hi. I hope it's okay that I came. Yeah, I'm glad you're here. What happened with that opportunity? Oh, it didn't pan out. Big surprise. You're wearing the necklace. Of course I am. Look, sweetie. I didn't like how we left things... how I left things the other day. So, I... I just wanted to come wish you luck riding today. Thank you, Annie. I know I did the right thing giving you up all those years ago... but... that doesn't mean that I don't love you... or that I can't love you. So, uh, I was kind of hoping we could be friends. I'd like that. Yeah, me too. - Mom! - Hey, honey. Hi. This is my mom, Clara. And this is Annie. You have raised a fine young daughter. And you gave birth to a beautiful little baby. Ladies and gentlemen, the trick-riding championships are up next. We've got the Sweethearts of the Rodeo! Would you like to come sit with us? No, I just stopped by for a minute. - It's real nice to meet you. - Yeah, it's nice to meet you. I'll let you two say good-bye. You go out there and win today. I feel like I already have. All right. Well, go get 'em! Good luck, Dakota! Come on, girl. You got some riding to do. It feels like I'm standing here waiting for something Feet on the edge and I'm this close to jumping I'm thinking about letting go Sink or swim 'Cause how you ever gonna know if you never begin? So just dive in Unbelievable riding by the Lone Stars! Great job, girls! Well, ladies and gentlemen, here they are, your cowgirls, the Sweethearts of the Rodeo! So reach for the sky There's no time to waste Just take my hand Let's break away It feels like I'm standing here waiting for something Feet on the edge and I'm this close to jumping I'm thinking about letting go Sink or swim 'Cause how you ever gonna know if you never begin? Come on, Dakota. You can do it! I know you can! Now Just can't stop me now. Now Hey I guess everything does happen for a reason. I'll always love my parents for raising me and loving me... and putting up with all of my bratty ways. And I'll always love my birth mother for having me... and then being wise enough to give me up. Ladies and gentlemen, this year's trick-riding championship goes to the Sweethearts of the Rodeo! Led by Isaac Benson, Madison de la Cruz with a little help from Austin Rose! Austin was right. It's not about blood, but It is about the heart. Families come in many shapes and sizes, but the one thing they all share is love and laughter... and just being there for each other forever. Well, that's my story. I'm Dakota Rose, proud member of my very own uniquely amazing... and still growing family. Friends? Friends. If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd have been married a long time ago Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd have been married a long time ago Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? He rode into town and made me believe He'd spent half his life just a-lookin' for me I thought he loved me But boy, I was wrong 'Cause he had his fun then we were over and done Keep on dancin' I'll tell you the tale About a tall, dark fiddler with eyes so pale With a look he hooked every girl in town Makin' any other man just another rebound I heard the story Thought it couldn't be true Till he rode through here back in '02 He broke my heart, and he stole my soul Makin' me another victim of Cotton-Eyed Joe If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd have been married a long time ago Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd have been married a long time ago Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? Cotton-Eyed Joe Where did you go? Cotton-Eyed Joe Cotton-Eyed Joe She plays it to the bone Gives her all Even when that barrel tips and falls Taught to always hold that head up high and tall All leads to the time they make Every step the wild horse takes It's a gamble she can handle 'Cause he's her leap of faith She keeps hangin' on To the dream she's always known For the glory damn the pain Holds it all within them reins She's country tough And there's no giving up From her boots down to her precious Laddie go Her head is a rodeo Her head is a rodeo
