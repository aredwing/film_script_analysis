A defeat that encouraged all the oppressed peoples to flght for freedom. Take care of those who have a chance to survive. What happened? They jumped on us. There were hundreds of them. And that deafening noise... It was the devil's own work. Do you really believe they had hundreds of volunteers? I promised my mother I'd be back. And you will. It wasn't the devil's work. Let us pray in honour of Juan Casellas and all those fallen in the Battle of the Bruc. With the help of the Virgin of Montserrat they defeated the French army. Where is Juan? I'll talk to that fool later. We'd better go in now. Excuse me. I didn't mean to disturb you. It's beautiful! Are you a painter? - A journalist. Henry Magne from "Moniteur". You must be the young man they're all talking about. People here like to talk. Don't take any notice of them. No one better than you could tell me what happened. How could a handful of volunteers force a whole army to retreat? It was... It was the mountain. The mountain? The mountain and the Virgin of Montserrat. There's no more to tell. Thanks for the drawing. I doubt they'll be back. But if they are, we'll beat them again. They've defeated all the armies in Europe. A small failure won't stop them. You say that because you're half-French. Miguel! Don't talk like that to the doctor. Leave him. He'll soon realise all new ideas come from France. No one can stop that. - Father... My brother will. If he did it once in the Bruc he can do it again. That's enough, Miguel. Listen to your mother. Sorry, he's a bit impulsive. I always wondered when the first defeat would be. I imagined something... More glorious. Choose! The implacable style of Pascal Baraton or the iron fists of the "Turk". Make your betsl It's your last chance. One... Two... Three! Go ahead! The flght... can begin now. It's urgent, Captain. From the Emperor's headquarters. Dear, Eric: I never thought l'd ever have to read a communique of defeat. It is at such moments of despair that I need soldiers like you. You belong to that race of brave soldiers that only France can produce. Don't let our enemies defile the French flag with impunity. I know you'll pursue that drummer till you find him, and that you'll cut off his head and show it to the World. The whole of Europe will know that those who threaten the honour of France must die. I'm counting on you. We have a winner! The implacable Pascal Baraton! Gather all the men. How many did you kill, Bruc? My name is Juan. I hate to be called Bruc, especially by my brother. Pay attention. These weapons are useless at over 15 metres. Why won't you say what happened? How many men where there? To hunt you must be patient... and quiet. It can smell us. Come. There it is. What are you waiting for? Shoot! Run! - Where to? This way. Miguel! Jump. Run! I keep thinking about it. You were very brave in the Battle of the Bruc. I was lucky. Your mother and I have some savings. Not much, but enough to get you to Barcelona to join the Military Academy. I've watched you grow, son. You're as hard as these mountains. And there's no better hunter than you in the whole region. Father, please... There is no future here, son. You'll be a coalman all your life, same as your grandfather. Same as your children if you don't change. And now is the moment to do it Believe me, son. Gloria's father is a doctor. He won't let her marry a mere coalman. Then let me have that money to start my own business. So I can stop being a mere coalman. I'm proud of you, son. We all are. Marti! - Juan! What's my godfather doing here? - I've a surprise for you. Granted by the Field Marshall. I wish I'd been with you in the Bruc. But first you should wash yourself. The Frogs will take their time. They'll never forgive us. Napoleon had never lost a battle. We'll thrash them again, llke in the Bruc. Like in the Bruc. - Long live the Bruc. Good night, sir. Stop! Load your weapons. Stop or we'll shoot! Where is he? Where are you going? Don't you dare follow me again. Do you like it? A lot. - It's for you. No it's yours. You've earned it. I want you to keep it till the day we get married That will be the only time I'll wear it. I've spoken to my father. He knows someone at Havana's General Hospital. I could get a job there. We could fulfil our dream. Here he is, the hero of the Bruc. Hunted down like a rat. It's not him. Who is he? Not the one from the Bruc? It's his younger brother. It's his brother. What shall we do, Captain? Burn it! Juan... - It's my home. What happened? - I don't know. Go and find Marti, qulck! Father! Father! Mother! Mother! Mother! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! No! Miguel! Hang in there, Juan! Marti! Attab! I want everyone out. Don't make us throw you out by force. Are you French? So am I. Henry Magne. Journalist Here. Five! Leave your homes or we'll burn the village. I want names. Fiancees, cousins, grandparents. All your relatives. Anyone related to Juan Casellas come out here immediately. Now! No! Please, stop! He's just a child. If you weren't French, you'd be dead. The next one in your head! No! Please! I'm his flancee. She's telling the truth. Look. Nouaille! How many times do I have to tell you? We must stay together. Let me see. Attab, follow him. - Don't move. Two thousand silver reales if you come with me. Is no one going to do anything? I'm offering two thousand reales! We must do something. For the love of God! They took my daughter! Take care of him. - I'm not a doctor. Never mind. - I have no instruments. Do what you can, please. Baraton! Attab! Let me see. What you have done is honourable. If the wound is infected, we'll be delayed. He is there. Let's wait for the Captain. He's here somewhere. No! Down! Captain, he's with the girl! No! - Don't movel You've had no time to reload. Run, Juan, run! Nouaille, stay with her. The others come with me! Give it to me. We don't know if he's dead. I want his head. Bring it to me. Why do you sing in English? You hate them. With all my heart. But their songs are merry. This one is very popular. "Garryowen'. I'd never heard it. It's one of my favourites. Captain Maraval taught it to me. He was my teacher at the Academy. He's like a father to me. Can you untie me a moment? Please. I cured you. Captain? Father! Drop your sabre! Drop your sabre! On your knees! - No. On your knees! - I only knee before the Emperor. And you, free my daughter. No! Father! Father! Murderersl May God punish youl Spare the journalist. He'll draw us holding the boy's head. Tie the girl! Father! Are you sure? Yes, he was here. Someone took him by mule. Drink this, it'll do you good. You're the young man from the Bruc, right? I wish I'd never been in that battle. Don't say that. They all talk about you since that battle. You symbolise the struggle against the invader. They won't stop till I'm dead. Don't let them. We need you alive. Then give me something to eat. l may be a symbol, but I'm starving. No time. They'll soon find you here. Where can I go? Come. The view from here is marvellous. Claim sanctuary, and you'll be safe. Austerlitz, Heliopolis, Eylau, Jena... You've fought in all the great battles. You studied with the Emperor. And everyone knows how highly he thinks of you. You should be in Versailles, not in these mountains. Since when have you been covering the war? Since Egypt? Jena? Since I left my regiment. I had my leg blown apart in Egypt. You like the battlefield. Me too. I don't Iike watching from afar. I like being among my men. And they know it. Like in Eylau. De la Mata, the Catalan fellow, saved my life I owe him one. Did you talk to the coalman? - Yes. How did he defeat Schwartz's column? He said it was thanks to his Virgin. And to the mountain. If you kill him, he'll become a legend. If I kill him, he won't even be a footnote in the history books. Good morning. We're looking for a young man. A coalman. There's no coalman here. Someone took him by mule. By mule? Everyone here has a mule. Do you llke chickpeas? He's deaf and dumb. He was taken prisoner in Egypt. The Mamelukes tortured hlm, but they couldn't get a word out of him. And you know what happened? They cut his tongue. Difficult to understand him. Captain! Try them! Try them! How many did you kill, Bruc? You wene very brave in the Battle of the Bruc. Are you ail right, son? Why won't you tell us wnat happened? Everyone is waiting for you. I doubt they'll be back. But if they are, we'Il beat them again. A small failure won't stop them. My brother will. If he did it once in the Bruc, he can do it again. Isn't fighting for your country a good emough reason? We could fulfil our dream. I'm proud of you, son. I love you. - We all are. Where is he? This is a sacred place. You can't come in here armed. Father, we know a coalman is hiding here. Hand him over to us, and we'll leave quietly. People here come and go at thelr own will. They claim sanctuary. The Revolution doesn't believe in God. This is the House of God! Armed men have no place here. The cowls! Remove your cowls! This is outrageous! - Get out of here! Remove your cowls! Tell me where he is, or I'll set fire to the monastery. Nothing will be left of your Virgin. Enough! Stop killing innocent people! Attab! Flnd Nouaille. Bring the girl. I'll kill you. Better still, they'll cut your girl's throat. Tell him to surrender! He says you should surrender. We have your fiancee. Surrender and she'll be spared. If you don't surrender, she'll die. We have no interest in her! Don't do it, Juan! Don't hurt her! Let her go! Next it will be her ear. Her ear! Let her go or he dies! Captain, I trust you. I owe him my life. Let him go and I'll free the girl! Let me go, he says! Let her go first! Let her go. Run, Juan! Help the girl! - What? Help her. This one, Captain! If you get in the way again, I'll klll you. Have you got a flint? I need to cauterize my wound. Gloria! Maybe you really are the devil. Gloria. My father... he also. - Gloria, I'm sorry. Sorry I got you involved in this. Don't say that. Take her down to the village. You're not coming? If I go down with you, they'll find me. And more people wlll die. I need you to go down and ask for help. Don't let them kill you, Juan. If there's hand to hand combat, look out for Maraval's boot. We should go to the village. He needs help. I'll wait for him here. You go down, if you want. He needs me. The food is good. It's your stomach that's not right. We are soldiers. We deserve to die fighting against a wall of bayonets, not in these damn mountains He's takang us to his territory. Damn mountains! He leaves no trace on the rocks. He's there - Let me go. I'll bring you his head. Each hour that goes by is like a dagger in France's heart. I want his head. It can't be! He's just a coalman. A nobody. Come out! Fight bravely! Be a man! You wanted to bring me here? Well, here I am! Come on out! Be a man! Fight! You murdered my parents! You murdered my brother! You're as hard as these mountains. But you won't come out alive. Juan! I love you so much. I'm so proud of you. Have this. You deserve it more than I do. "Ah, the Spanish War! That damn war was the onigin of the tragedy of France" Napoleon Bonaparte, 1816
