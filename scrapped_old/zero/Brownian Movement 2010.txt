 

                        It's quite spacious. The mattress is new. Back there's the bathroom. - Where're you from? - From Berlin. When he saw her human hands he said: My wife had silver hands. "Merciful God" said the queen "it caused my hands to grow again". And the angel going into the chamber... brought out the silver hands and showed them to him. Now he perceived that they were certainly his dear wife and child. and he kissed them glad and said: A heavy stone is taken from my heart. And after eating a meal together with the angel... they went home to the king's mother. Their arrival caused great rejoycing everywhere... and the king and queen celebrated their marriage again. And ever afterwards lived happily together until the end of their lifes. - One more? - No, tomorrow night. - One more. Please. - No, tomorrow. Sleep well. - Mom, can I read another chapter? - Nope. - Please. - No, it's late, Benjamin. - Good night. - Don't let the bed-bugs bite. Thank you. I have to be on the WPFD on the 23rd. Mh-hm. Can you pick Benjamin up from school today? Don't know if I can make it Of course. Can we wait with group 4010? We're not ready yet. Ah. Be right there. Thank you. Computing the investigation of the incidence risk factors... and monitory for the drugs regreations... that can be detected with a biochemical test. Such as blood induced blood disorders... and the identification of potential biomarkers for a drugs regreations. So, the objective of this research... is to investigate the value of laboratory data collected in patient care. What is it? Is it a phone? Sorry. Well, it's nice, I didn't know it had a ringtone like this. I like it. Um... yeah. Uh... now we focus on drugs induced thrombocytopenia. As an example. First we investigated.. - I'll go ahead and do it. - Thank you. I love you. I love you too. Hi. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm late. I'm sorry. - Hello. - Hello. - Hey. - Hey. - So did you start already? - No. No? Good. So, Benjamin's doing really fine. He's a smart guy. He's really interested in... reading and in stories. - Everything all right? - Yes. - You're still coming around tomorrow? - Yes. You're early. I want to look inside. See you later. Hello. Don't you recognize me? You recognize me? Slow down... Madam. Calm down. Calm down. It's time. Oh, I'm sorry. - We'll continue tomorrow. - Yes. - See you tomorrow. - Thank you. I... If I... Mm, I'm not sure... It's just... it's... it's very difficult for him. For me, too. But even worse for him of course. I understand it. He doesn't trust me anymore. And of course I... I know... I just think... I mean, if I... If... if I... How's it going with your new medication? I really don't know what I'm supposed to feel. - It takes a while. - Yes. Is he going too with Isaac tomorrow? I don't know for sure if he'll be coming. - I did asked him to. - Well, we'll see. - Shall we begin? - Yes. Max is a very good lover. We know each other well. It's very... familiar when we... He knows what I like. He's very warm, very tender. And... We have discovered a sort of way to... A way of... things we do. How we start. It's not that it's always the same. I mean, we don't have a certain pattern... but that is not absolut. It changes too. Whether I, or... he, or... the way it goes. And that is actually always... good. Can you tell us what the difference is between Max... and the men you invited to your room? Right. They don't have anything to do with each other. It is really something entirely different. They are... They all have something... Max is a very handsome man, and he's attractive and... I want to touch Max always. That's almost automatic. It's, uh... Do you mean you didn't really want to touch the other men? No. Yes. Yes, I mean yes. but it's, um... it's different. It's a completely... different sort of touching. It's an even entirely different feeling... But when... but when did you decide to rent a room? Was that before our vacation? Or did you already have it on Benjamin's birthday... when we had that horrible arguement? Was that actually about this? - What? Benjamin's birthday? - Then why would you rent a room there? Why didn't you just go to a hotel? How did you find that room anyway? All the preparations before you could even start. I was... lying in bed and... suddenly I saw this... hairy arm. And... it was lying on my stomach. Only then I did realize I was not alone. And you still hadn't looked at the man beside you in bed? Yeah, afterwards. He was asleep. - What did he look like? - I don't know. Huge and sweaty. - And his face? - I didn't looked at his face. I was watching the hair on his arm. You told us about the man with bitten nails. The man with the hairy body. The man with the pockmarked nose. You chose these men based on those details. Why do you think you did that? Can you give me an example? Why such a man with a pockmarked nose? What did you want from that man? What did you ask of him? I think... I think I shouldn't be saying it. I shouldn't tell at all. It only makes it worse. Madam von Ribeck? On March 4, 2009, the central medical disciplinary tribunal... has made a preliminary verdict. This serves as evidence for the final verdict... and as an indispensable expert psychiatric report... for information and advice of this case... to determine the time of the research of... Madam von Ribeck's disease or other disabilities show... that the issues... detract too much from her duties as a doctor to perform properly. The psychiatrist is the Saint-Jean de Dieu hospital in Brussels... and on behalf of it's disciplinary tribunal report published on July 8, 2009. The psychiatrist seriously doubts that Madam von Ribeck... will be able to properly fulfill her duties as a doctor in the future. The psychiatrist found that Madam von Ribeck... not at all understands what she's done. After the examination the psychiatrist says also that Mrs. Von Ribeck... shows no insight and suffers from an underdeveloped conscience. This means that Madam von Ribeck insufficiently expressed regret... about the acts she has committed during the period in question. In this case, empathy for the accused person's position... isn't justified... and the need for health allows no risk to run. The verdict of the central medical disciplinary tribunal... to remove Charlotte Gudrun von Ribeck from the medical register... should therefore be executed. The time will be about one week. - One week? - Yes. You sure? Are you sure this will done by Friday? I'm pretty damn sure. - Yeah? - I will check. - Five meters? - Yes. Let me do it, ma'am. I'll do it. - No, no, Ms. Shanti, thank you. - I can finish it by tomorrow. Yes, but, you know it keeps me busy. - Okay, ma'am. - Okay, you're very kind, thank you. Nobody's here. They're gone to another building. No-one is here. Everybody's gone, hm? They went to another building. Oh. - I have a look inside anyway, okay? - Right. - Okay, okay. - Yeah? Okay. - Thank you. - Okay. - Hi. Is she inside? - Sorry? - Charlotte, is resting? - No, sir, she's gone into town. - I brought lunch. - Thank you. Does she go into town often? Alone I mean? Yes, sir. Every morning, sir. Look at me. Can you let me in? Max? Max? Sounds okay. - Is that good? - Yeah. Come and lie down. Come. Sometimes I don't know who you are anymore. I'm the same person. I don't know if that's enough. I'm here. Now. With you. Why can't that be enough?
