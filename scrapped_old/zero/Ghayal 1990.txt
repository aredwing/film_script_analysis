 

                        1 After considering all circumstances and statements... this court considers accused Ajay Mehra as guilty under... I.P. Code 302 and sentences him for life in prison. He's been here for sometime but doesn't talk with anybody. His silence says a lot. Was it some nightmare? It is reality. We're familiar with that reality, Ajay. Our crimes are based on the same reality you just described He is Mitwa. I found myself on footpath and grew up hearing people's abuses Committed 13 murders in 20 years. What wrong did I do? Vradha Rajan. I came from Madras. Carrying burden of humanity, hard-work and honesty. Bombay city took it and gave pistol, gun and knife. Rajan Berry. Never thought hands that took degree will rob or murder. But I did that. We too have complaints with our life my friend. But we've to compromise. Gradually these fingers will learn to hold these iron rods. These walls, roof and glassier will make you forget the past... which has brought you in today's position. How can I forget the past? No. I can't forget... Everything was so good... "Darling..." "I take your oath." "I don't want to live Without you..." "Darling..." "what is life without you? "What is life without you? You are my heart. You are my life. I will always be where you are. You are my heart. You are my life. "Darling..." "I take your oath." "I don't want to live Without you..." What is life without you? I was born on this earth for you. Since I met you I have become a stranger to myself. We have been meeting like this for many lifetimes. The two of us are reflections of the same body. Where could I go leaving.. "The comfort of your love? "I don't want to live Without you..." What is life without you? "Darling..." "I take your oath." "I don't want to live Without you..." What is life without you? Your face is entrenched in my eyes. My fate is secured to your scan'. Your love is ensconced in my breath. My life is beautiful because of your love. Both my worlds are drenched in your colors. What is life without you? What is life without you? You are my heart. You are my life. I will always be where you are. You are my heart. You are my life. I will always be where you are. "Darling..." "I take your oath." "I don't want to live Without you..." "I don't want to live Without you..." Varsha, your home has come. Today, I'll go to my home. - What do you mean? It's clear. Girl's real home is her beloved's home. Sure, but after marriage. When will we get married? - Very soon. I'm waiting for our country's problems to be solved. What about our children? Their future? Their career? You make a joke of everything. Be serious sometimes. You've everything - a brother, Bhabhi [brother's wife]. Me? I've become lonely after mommy and daddy passed away. You think I don't understand. But my brother is very short-tempered. I'll take help of my Bhabhi - I'll talk to her tomorrow. You use delaying tactics. I'm going to talk myself. No Varsha, don't do that. She needs beautiful, simple and shy girl. Beautiful, simple and shy... That's what I am. Yes, that's right. - So, let's go and talk... Varsha, don't be silly. It's not that easy, I need time - I give you 24 hours. What can I do in one day. - 20 hours. Okay, 24 hours are okay. - 18 hours... 15 hours, 13... No Bhabhi, I can't see you working - let me help you. Whafre you doing - leave it. You work so much - you need someone to share your work. I've asked maid servant - she'll start from tomorrow. Not her. We need someone who helps like a family member. Do you understand? - Yes. You love somebody. You're afraid to say it to your brother and I should say to him Your brain is as beautiful as your face. You're great Bhabhi. I understand How does she look? Who? - The girl. She's beautiful, Bhabhi - very beautiful. Nothing in comparison to you. But she is okay for helping you I'm not asking her for myself. I understand everything - I'll talk with your brother. Let us go Bhabhi. - Now?. Never postpone till tomorrow what you can do today. Come. I said I'll talk! So young lord is in love. And he wants to marry. Good. It will be fine. You too recommend that. I know. Where is he now. - He's here. Should I call him. Ajay! Call him lovingly. Ajay. Didn't come! Nay Did you call me brother? I am told you've grown up. Okay. You're in love - and you want to get married. No brother, Bhabhi wanted - I mean Bhabhi was saying she needs someone to help her. I suggested maid servant's name but she said maid won't work... she wants from family and asked me to get married. She wants a daughter-in-law. - Daughter-in-law?. I said I enjoy my freedom... - Well said... But she doesn't agree. I said how Laxman can do such a thing without Ram's permission. Very good. Mrs. Ska and Mr. Laxman - stop your Ramayan. Listen carefully to what I say. What were you saying? - About love, brother. Remove the craze of love from your mind. I did. You have to become a boxing champion - win a gold medal. You'll lose everything in the craze of marriage. - Yes. You're scolding him as if he has committed an offense. What else is this? What had you done? - What had I done? You used to tease me by blowing horn in the mid of night. In the midnight! Waking whole neighborhood! I come home early And because of this craze your brother was arrested once. Oh yes. No, no... what are you talking? You went to jail. - She is lying. Lying. Gupta uncle got him released. And he said, what's in jail he can even accept hanging for me. Really, brother. - No, no. Didn't I hang by marrying you? I don't want him to do that. I don't know anything. First a daughter-in-law will come. Yes. Listen. He'll become boxing champion. First daughter-in-law... - First boxing champion... Order, order. What's going on Ashok? Good, you've come. Now you can decide. First this is not court, it's my niece's home... And here, I'm not barrister Gupta - I'm uncle Gupta. Do you understand? How are you lndu? - I'm okay. Good. Yes, AjaY- How is your practice? Exactly! - What? He is actively practicing - not boxing, but in love! Like Mughal-e-Azam. - I see. And your niece is supporting him. Look. - What does it mean lndu? My lord I request he may be granted his love. Because every successful man has a support of a woman... And that woman in Ajay's life is his beloved. She is right. I think we should see the girl. What are you saying uncle. Uncle, you too. - I too, Ashok. Leave it uncle. - But I'm talking in your favor I'll sacrifice my love for the dreams of my brother. Oh Devdas - stop this drama. - He's pretending. We want to see the Menaka who's melted my steel like brother. So you are agreeing. Really. - Yes. Really. Shake hand. Thank you, sister-in-law. Thank you, uncle. Thank you brother. Thank you. This boy is confused - Also in hurry. I seems he will derinetly married. What happened? Did brother and Bhabhi agree. Same as in Mughal-e-Azam. Brother became angry. He roared like a cloud - - I snapped like lightening. Bhabhi poured like monsoon. Brother took out the gun - I bared my chest. His gun... my chest... What happened next? - His gun...my chest... Bhabhi's tears. Gupta uncle's wailing. I said I'll give life but won't break my promise to you. Didn't I? - Yes, yes. Then what happened? - Firing. Bullet went in roof. They speak.. You mean they agreed! Ajay, that's great. that simply great. Do we go to cinema. Be serious. Have you thought about tomorrows match. What's there to think about. What? - Yes.

Varsha! - Yes. Varsha. Our wedding permit. I've been selected for the tournament. - Congratulations. We marry before the main championship. How can I explain it to you. What I'm going through. After loss in business everybody has deserted me. Friends and relatives have exposed their true face. I'd not even dreamt that I'll do this to repay my debts. Don't know whether I can be free from debts or not. Why don't you explain clearly. - What should I explain? What's going on with you? You don't let go anything. - Why shouldn't I. If you don't tell me, who else will you tell. - Brother! What's the matter? - Nothing. What do you have in hand? I've been selected for the tournament. I've to go to Bangalore for training. Well done my champion. Did you hear? - I heard. What did you hear. Our Ajay is going to become champion. Let's have an outing. - I won't go. How won't you go - we'll take you forcibly.

Nobody knows when the moment comes to separate. "Why to worry We'll face whatever comes" "Why to worry We'll face whatever comes" "Don't waste today for tomorrow Today won't come tomorrow." A human being is one who lives with a smile and song. A human being is one who lives with a smile and song. The moments of life are a gift of love. What more do we want? A human being is one who lives with a smile and song. For him a desert is an oasis and autumn is like spring.

He makes my Bhabhi weep so much Can I speak to Mr. Gupta please. Ajay here. Do you have his number. All right. Thank you. Gupta uncle has left for Delhi for 8-10 days. I've been with home for long time. He's upset for sometime. I heard Ashok and Balwant Rai started some business together. I don't know much but he let me go with 3 months salary. As I said Rai is not an ordinary man. He helps people like Ashok and forget. Still I'll remind him. For next two months he is extremely busy. Go on. That day he was very disturbed. Boss is after me.

Such policemen should be shot in the midst of the road. It's good idea. - You think I'm joking. Joke! No. I was thinking - who would fire the shots. I will. Kept me at police station for two hours.

And expanded his business in the name of Ashok's company. What kind of business? - Business of death. Drugs. Balwant Rai is a big dealer of illicit drugs. He has lakhs of goods in and around here. What are you saying? Your brother too was afraid of the truth. It is too much. I want to get out of this swamp. Moreover, I've paid back your debts. You take my advice - stop all this.

But didn't he meet you again? Yes, he met. One day he met me here again. In this place? - Yes. There was no other place to meet. This was our world. We were the king of this place. I remember clearly, I was sitting here. He was where you are sitting. You are talking nonsense. All fingers are not alike. You don't know Ajay - my brother will definitely come.

No, those papers are proof of your crimes. The mask of decency will come off your face soon. Hey, enough. If Ashok has told about the bag he would be dead by now. If he has not told, he would be hanging between life and death. Come on - take me there. - Where? To my brother. Hey son of mosquito - come over here. Let's quietly run from here. - Who is he? He's the owner of this bar. Balwant Rai's stooge. He is quite dangerous man. He was here that day. Come down. Now I'll answer your punch. Come. Nobody will intervene. Watch him dying, wherever you are. He's hot blooded, I'll freeze him. Hey, what's this? Four men on one side. I'm here too, brother. Don't make the mistake of thinking he is alone. I am coming. Leave. - Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! Arrest him. Hooliganism in public place - you aren't afraid of law. This is your law?. Show courage and arrest Balwant like this. He has kidnapped my brother. Don't allege any big man - do you have any proof? They took that man who was the proof - in your presence. You'll get the proof - his dead body. Then write your report. You'll get official medal! - Don't talk rude. Police does... Does nothing. Throw away your uniform. And wear the collar of Balwant Rai on your neck. My foot! My foot! My foot! This is lawless place. Show your manhood on poor and weak. Power of uniform. You can put handcuff only these hands! Not on Balwant Rai! Move your tail. Kiss their feet - they'll thrown bones to you. You are doing good inspector - you're doing very well. You'll get promotion and medals Why are you running. Listen me. I will drag you to the court, you bastard. You're going to pay for this. Barrister Pramod Sharan Gupta - who solves everybody's problems who handles problems of big companies, state and nation - isn't aware of his own family problems. Ashok is missing and nobody has told me. You were in Delhi, I thought... - What? Is any case more important than my kids. You could've phoned me Uncle, Bhabhi told me but... You didn't think it necessary - because you've grown up. And did you realize implication of what you did last night? If I wasn't here, how could she have bailed you out. I've explained everything... - lndu, bring some tea. Sure. Why don't you believe me. Balwant Rai is a big smuggler. Brother is in his confines - his life is in danger. We must do something quickly. - Ajay.. You're believing a drunkard you don't even know. Whereas, Ashok is always praising Balwant Rai. And he has helped Ashok many times. Help! That was a plan to trap brother. Who are you talking about? - No, nothing. I'm no less anxious about Ashok than you. He's like my son. I'll leave no stone unturned to find him. But you don't complicate the matter in haste or emotion. I've come. Everything will be resolved. He'll come soon. I've tried everybody. Nobody helps in time of need. Gupta uncle says, he has talked with the commissioner. They are looking into the matter. But no result. I'm watching this game for last one month. Don't know brother's condition or how much is he suffering. Varsha, I hear his cries. He needs me - I can't do anything... Balwant Rai. I'll see Balwant Rai right now and find out everything... No Ajay. I don't know why but I'm afraid. I think it would be wrong to go to Balwant Rai at this time. You first talk with Gupta. - I don't need anybody. I'll do whatever I must do. C'mon, Versha. Try to understand. Nothing will happen to me. I'll be careful. Ajay I'm so worried. Congrates, Mr. Rai? We're pleased you won this year too. Thank you. That's your love speaking else I truly don't deserve it. Mr. Balwant Rai - I've to talk with you. Talk with Mohile. - I've to talk with you. Come to office tomorrow. - Not tomorrow - now. Excuse me. Sure. Disturbing in party... - Where is my brother? Hasn't he returned. I'd asked Mohile to call the Commissioner Before I expose you before these respectful people... Be descent and tell me where's my brother. Waiter. Send Han. You've some misunderstanding. I've seen the devil under your high personality and cover. No Ajay. You don't know me yet. Those who clash with me, lose their life very painfully. Give these empty threats to someone else. If my brother is hurt I'll punish you so bad that you'll repent you were ever born. And these dogs who encourage you... to bark, won't be seen anywhere near you. Bastard! Let go! Let go off me! Bastard! I will drain your blood, you bastard! If my brother doesn't return by tomorrow, I'll kill you. Take away this drunken goon. I'll kill you,.. Let me go! Let go! Let me go! Sorry gentlemen. I'm sorry. Please continue. Run, police has come. Hey, where are you fleeing? Cowards! You bastards! Come here and get me. Come here. What's going on. Who were those people They were that bastard's dogs. I kill those bastards. - Behave. He's commissioner. Be polite, you're talking to the police commissioner. What's the problem. My name is Ajay. My brother is missing since last one month. I filed a report with police - but nothing has been done. When I found the person who has kidnapped, yet the police are... not ready to do anything. You tell me sir, what should I do? Who is that. What's his name? Balwant Rai. See, you're badly hurt - - These wounds won't kill me... You tell me - will you help? I'll ask ACP Bhosle to investigate thoroughly. Investigate? I've been seeing this drama of investigation since one month. My brother's life is in danger - you say they'll investigate! C'mon Commissioner, this is your job. Your job, Commissioner. Look mister" Police has to act under certain rules and regulations. We can't take action against anybody without proof. C'mon driver. If you like you meet ACP Bhosle tomorrow. This city is no longer worth living. After your brother comes, we'll settle in some peaceful place. I talked to Gupta uncle. He has met the commissioner. He assured your brother will come soon. Don't worry too much Then what should I do? Should I sit doing nothing? What has anybody lost? My brother is missing. Nobody will do anything. This is a city of blind and deaf. All are like stones. One could only break one's head over here. I've been wandering like crazy people since one month. Who knows he's alive or not? - Ajay. What should I do, sister-in-law? What should I do? Sir, we've found papers Ashok Mehra was hiding. Should I put him underground. Hello. Today I saw your anxiety to meet your brother. Balwant Rai! I appreciate your enthusiasm. If anything happens to my brother I'll kill you. You can meet your brother in Central Park. Show your enthusiasm to reach your brother. You bastard! Son of a bitch, listen to me. Hello! Hello! Ajay! Ajay! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Balwant Rai - you killed my brother. Balwant Rai! Is anybody hearing. My brother has been killed. Is everybody dead? My brother has been killed. They killed my brother uncle. Where are you calling from? - Central Park telephone booth. Uncle they killed and threw my brother. What should I do uncle? Ajay. - What should I do? Hello. Don't be afraid, Ajay. Come quickly uncle. - Yes, I'm coming. Uncle, come soon. - I am coming. Yes. Stay right there. Yes. lndu! lndu, collect yourself. Why have they arrested Ajay. Admit you murdered your brother What are you doing Sharma? Have you gone mad? Do you want to kill him? - Now he will admit. Ajay they can do anything. Say what they want. I'm with you. I'll help you in the court - you tell me. Go Bashir, join some drama company You'll earn a lot. Your acting is very good. How about this acting. Bribery and cunning have killed effect of your mother's milk. You are hollow and useless. I wish to... But now that will solve your problem. Not mine. You've to die painfully within the four walls of prison. And I'll have you punished. You'll repent very much by leaving me alive. Accused is wasting court's time All proofs, witnesses and investigative reports show that accused has murdered Ashok Mehra. He's trying to put blame on Balwant Rai to confuse the case From this box he has insulted the law and the court. I'll bring an important witness for whom we waited for 2 days. Specially, accused Ajay Mehra. Permission granted. - Present Pramod Sharan Gupta. This name doesn't need any introduction. Whose name is taken with great respected in the world of law. Who has taken law to new height - who's created good examples. Mr. Gupta, tell the Court what you know about this case. The victims wife is my niece - I'm very close to this family. Ashok and Ajay used to fight often. But I'd never thought they will result in murder. When on 7 November I received Ajay's phone saying... he has murdered Ashok - - What are you saying? Then too I didn't believe him. But when I reached there Ajay was holding Ashok's body... My Lord, Ajay wanted that I should hide his crime. He is lying! He's talking nonsense. Yes, my Lord! This is a lie. This is not true. It's a conspiracy. It is a conspiracy to frame a.. - Order! Order! Why don't you understand - Ajay is innocent. Whatever you want to say, you can say from witness box. Now you please sit down. Varsha. Whafre you saying uncle? Fear from God. Don't believe his statement. He is lying. I gave more importance to my duty than relation or emotion. So I informed the police - He is also been sold. Balwant Rai has bought him too. They are all together. Order, order. Mr. Gupta, can you throw some light on cause of this murder. I'm ashamed to say this. But no husband can tolerate his wife's affair with another man. Tell everything clearly to the Court Mr. Gupta. The accused Ajay had illicit relation with his Bhabhi. Gupta! I'll kill you, Leave me! Gupta! I'll kill you! I will kill you! Leave me! Leave me! I'll make you handicapped. C'mon, get up! Get up! After considering all circumstances and statements... this court considers accused Ajay Mehra as guilty under... I.P. Code 302 and sentences him for life in prison. Oh God, she is a worst sinner. She looks innocent, but... - Husband's brother is like son She's scar on the society. She should kill herself by drowning. 'O Ram, what has the world come to?' She should be excommunicated. She has no right to live in the society. 'Such relations with her brother-in-law?' 'Shame! A sister-in-law is akin to a mother.' 'This is a catastrophe! Such a woman should drown and die.' She is not woman, but a witch. She made brother murder brother Accused Ajay had illicit relation with his Bhabhi. She left this letter for Ajay. Ajay I'm leaving you alone in this cruel world in crucial time Forgive me. In the next life, I want you to be my son by birth. You must repay this debt. May God save you. We're with you Ajay. We'll to fight this battle with you. This is my battle. You can't fight this battle with sentiments. You can't fight with Balwant Rai alone. I'll fight alone. You call us your own and also refuse to accept us as your own Instead of breaking stones in jail it's better to help you. I can't endanger someone's life for my own goal. What life and what danger - We are already in under 302. Can be hanged anytime. Better run on first opportunity. Killing 2-4 like Balwant Rai will wash away our sins. We shall embark on a new life. And then we'll settle in our corners. Why don't you understand. - Agree with us Ajay. We've been in this hell for five years now. Good or bad, whatever we did, we did it for ourselves. Joining your battle might give some meaning to our life. Don't be obstinate Ajay. Shake hand friend. - Yes. That's more like it. Rain since last night has closed the dirt road to jail. Some jail vehicles have been caught on that road. Warden has asked me to take a few prisoners to clean road. I've given him name of the four of us. - Yes. They're getting ready to leave. Come Mitva. C'mon. Hurry up! Hurry HP! C'mon! Hurry HP! Faster! C'mon! Hurry! C'mon! Get to work. C'mon! You lazy man. Are you working or not? You scoundrel! You watch New Bombay area. You be in contact with Kwatre - I need report from all areas. You find more details. You connect me to Traffic commish. Three of them are professional criminals with many cases Fourth was in for murdering his brother. They injured five guards outside the jail. That means they would be armed. - They snatched two guns. From the guards? - Yes, from same guards. He's ACP D'Souza. I'm giving this case in his charge. What's the latest information? They've gone towards Pokhran jungle in Shaktiman truck. Jail has forwarded these pictures. Any other details. - No sir. My brother's life is in danger you say you'll investigate. 'C'mon Commissioner, this is your job! Your job, Commissioner!' Pokhran forest. As they've come so near to city it's clear they'll try to enter We should try to catch them outside the city. 'Moongra! Moongra! Moongra! I am a block of jaggery.' Come here if you want some or I shall leave, sweetheart. Come here if you want some or I shall leave, sweetheart. 'Moongra! Moongra! Moongra!' I am a block of jaggery.' 'Taste my heady flavor too since you've come my way.' Are you blind? Can't you see? What did you do? Broke my wall. Hey! Come out! You! Scoundrel, what does this mean? If you love your life - you should leave this place quickly In a few minutes everything will burn to ashes. No one move from his place. Sten gun! Problem! The bullets are over. Careful. Don't be afraid. I am Mitwa. No! Enough! Eat this. - No. I'll die. Balwant Rai's dog. Your this poison has taken innumerable innocent lives. Destroyed innumerable families. Eat this. - No. Hello! Balwant Rai. - Who's that? I've spent each day like a year behind the bars. In the next 24 hours, I'll cut you in 24 piece... and perform the last rites of each piece separately. You very well know consequence of clashing with me. Your dockyard where you kept your goods have burnt to ashes. You'll also find dead bodies of your stooges here in ashes. Don't worry - in 24 hours I'll send you and others to them. To the hell. I promise. Ajay! Ajay! Pradhan here. What? Oh no! You don't worry. We've made all arrangements. They'll be caught soon. I'm making arrangement. They've threatened to kill Mr. Rai within 24 hours. Mr. Rai? - He is a very big businessman. Threat to kill Mr. Rai is like challenging police department. What do these idiots think? They've not challenged Rai - but the police. Rest assured sir, they'll be caught very soon. 24-hours maybe short time for them but not for us. I've full trust in you. Make arrangement for Rai's security. An ordinary boy threatens at midnight to kill me in 24-hours How does it look? - We'll catch him. Our police... Shut up. Your police, your law is like you. Put some of your people at Gupta's house. Spread your net throughout the city. Dig him out wherever he may be hiding. If you can't get him alive bring his dead body. Youth is thirsty. The night is stormy. Youth is thirsty. The night is stormy. Thirsty! Thirsty! Thirsty! Night will pass. Live this moment. Enjoy yourself. There's excitement in the heart. Thunder in the chest, There are squalls in every breath. Amusement overspills from my voluptuous body. The heartbeats increase every moment. There in this ocean of beauty. Come and quench your thirst, crazy one. Come on. Youth is burning up. The night is pleasant. Youth is thirsty. The night is stormy. Thirsty! Thirsty! Thirsty! Night will pass. Live this moment. Enjoy yourself. Clink! Clink! Clink! Clink! The clouds pour. The body burns up. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! The heart beats. I cannot control myself. Poison is coursing through the veins. Now I can't find any peace. Jiggle! Jiggle! Jiggle! Jiggle! My body quivers. Will somebody embrace me? The body is also thirsty. Love is also thirsty. This occasion is truly thirsty. The body is also thirsty. Love is also thirsty. This occasion is truly thirsty. Light a fire in this weather. Put out the fire with fire. Put it out. Youth is thirsty. Youth is hot. Youth is thirsty. Youth is hot. Youth is thirsty. Youth is hot. Youth is thirsty. Youth is hot. My Lord. This is an absolute lie. This is a conspiracy. You don't understand. Ajay is innocent. Don't believe him. He is lying. - What are you saying? [The accused Ajay had illicit relation with his Bhabhi.] See, where is Kamle. He goes anywhere leaving the gate open. Laxmi! Laxmi! Wait a minute. Sir, where is Gupta. - He's Gupta. Sir, he gave 24-hour time - Deka and Gupta went in 8 hours. In the remaining 10 hours me and you will... Excuse me, Mr. Rai. He's ACP D'Souza. Pradhan has given this case to him. ACP D'Souza what's going on in this city? Four murderers break the prison and kill so many people. What's your police doing? Police is doing its job. Your security is our priority. I hope you'll help us in this matter. Support! Hello! Hello! - Hello. Mr. Pradhan. - Speaking. D'Souza here, sir. - Yes, tell me, sir. Sir, Pramod Sharan Gupta has been murdered. What? When? - Around 6:30 We found other bodies bearing foreign arms. They've not been identified. I think it's the same four behind this, sir. I feel there is another angle to these murders. Right now.. Pramod Sharan Gupta and foreign arms. Give importance to their arrest and security of Balwant Rai. Yes, sir. When are you coming to office? - I'm not coming today. I'm not too well. - What happened. No. It's not necessary for you to come. Hello. Just a minute, Keep me informed on phone about Balwant Rai's program. Yes, sir. I tell you again - don't play with the law. Law?. The law goes to bed with bastards like Balwant Rai. Brokers like Gupta have sold it And the guardians of law like you have enjoyed this show. I was going from pillar to post for my brother in this city. Knocking at the door of law. I met you too. Remember? Remember rainy night when I was begging for my brother's life. And one day Balwant Rai threw my brothers body on the road. And your law punished me by proving me his murderer. Law my foot! Mr. D'Souza.. I wanted to ask something. ls Ajay Mehra a good shot. Not really. Why? That means his bullet can go left or right. Because you are either left or right of Balwant Rai. Yes. Take care. God bless you. What? God bless me. Left. Right. Or at me. No. Ramu, keep the windows locked. What could be better than the fact that we are together? Smile a little. Sing a little. This is called life. What could be better than the fact that we are together? Nobody knows when the moment comes to separate. Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! You'd have called me there, I'd have come to Commish's house. Police is searching you every place. Why did you come out? Why did you take the risk of coming here. I came to meet brother and Bhabhi. They are here. They are in everything here. How happy were we in this home? I understand your pain Ajay. It isn't pain Varsha - it's fire. Rai who's responsible for this ruin is still alive. But he won't see the sun tomorrow. I'll kill him. Today. And, if something happened to you? Have you ever thought about me? No Ajay. I don't want to lose you again. What will you get from this fight? Will all that come back? Will this become a home again? Varsha, it's not only about me or this home. Who knows how many families he has destroyed? How many innocent lives he has taken? I agree this can't be the same home again. But many homes will be saved from destruction. Keep an eye on them. You don't understand. Mr. D'Souza has prohibited you from going out. All right. I'll speak with you later. What's the sense of all this? Do you want me to hide for the fear of that boy? That murderer Ajay Mehra would be freely moving. And in the name of security you've put me in house arrest. There is limit of stupidity. Look Mr. Rai.. Listen, this meeting is very important for me. If you can't arrange my security, I'll make my own. Barrister Gupta too made his own security arrangement. With foreign arms. You've seen its result. What do you want to say? Ajay Mehra's purpose in running from jail is to kill you. Even now he must be trying to reach you. He knows attacking you is like committing suicide. Mr. Rai, the man who has lost fear of death can do anything. Yet if going to meeting is so important to risk your life... ...then you must act in accordance with our plans. Ashok Pradhan speaking. How are you now commissioner? - I'm okay now. It's not okay here. I don't understand security arrangement you've done for me. I've to go to an important meeting but your Mr. D'Souza insists that I should go with him in a taxi. And someone else will go in my car. He wants to take me through slums. What should I do? Mr. D'Souza is the only person who can save you from death. Do whatever he says. Okay sir. Take care of him till we come. It was your plan Mr. D'Souza. See, what's happening. Go out and clear the traffic. - Please, come back quickly. Now what are you doing? Sit quietly. I was closing window. 24-hour notice has not yet ended. Will he attack you in bazaar. Not me sir, but you... - Shut up! Move out of the way! Ajay. Ajay! Leave! - Mitwa! You cover from behind. Mitwa! Listen Ajay, you go from here. Go... Go away from here. Leave. - Give me your hand, Mitwa. Why did you shoot him. We could have got him alive. S", Ajay.. - Shut up! Let go! Let go off me! Mitwa. Mitwa. - C'mon! Security! Plans! Bullshit! In broad day light, in bazaar. This city isn't worth living. Arrange for me to go to London. I'm asking you Mohile. What are you doing? I was closing the window - so bullets won't come... Shut up! I warned you. You all will meet the same fate as your companion You are playing with death. It's not fight, it's suicide. This is my advice to you as an elder, not as commissioner. Surrender while you still have time. I'll help you. Take out sympathy from brain, or I'll blow your brain out. No! 'An important announcement.' Four prisoners absconding from jail have created terror. One of the four prisoners was killed in encounter with police Police has intensified their effort to arrest them. Police posts have been set up on all roads going out of city. Police is also patrolling all city areas. They have threatened to kill Balwant Rai in 24 hours. While police is protecting Mr. Balwant Rai... a prominent newspaper has described him as a smuggler. Balwant Rai exposed! Balwant Rai exposed! He's being called a smuggler. Balwant Rai exposed! I'm being called a smuggler. And that jail-breaker murderer is fighting war of justice. Only God knows what'll happen of this country. I don't want to live here one more day. Where's London ticket What are you doing there? - I'm locking this door... Do you think Ajay will walk in and kill me in my home? Maybe he can. Our police are... I'll see everybody... And I'll sue Varsha in court for defamation. Won't leave her Leave it. Such a case might prove harmful for your fame. Think about your life first. You can sue if you're alive! Only you, me and your men knew the route we were taking. Whereas Ajay was already waiting for you there. Whole city is terror-stricken and you publish this article! Ajay Mehra is a murderer and cause of this bloodshed in city And you've made such vicious man hero of your story. It isn't story, it's real and police is responsible for this. Which compels ordinary man to become a criminal. Ajay. What do you know about Ajay? Just that - he is a murder! He murdered his brother! Had illicit relation with his Bhabhi! I'm sorry, Mr. Varsha. It wasn't my intention to hurt your feelings. I was... You wanted to know howl know... Not only I know Ajay, I fully understand him. I went to seem him in jail on 19 December. And I met him today. I didn't write this article in emotion, but responsibly. I don't have personal enmity with Ajay Mehra. In away I'll be helping him by arresting. Because you too know the consequence of path he is going If you meet him again you should ask him to surrender. He might obey you, because you know and understand him. Thank you. Varsha, who wrote that article is Ajay's beloved. She met him today. Don't know why D'Souza left her. If I were in his place I'd arrest her on remand.. ...and in two minutes I'd get her to cough up everything. Idiot. You don't understand this simple thing. We can use the card thrown by D'Souza. We needed exactly this card to declare our game. Hello. - Hello Varsha.. I'm Joe D'Souza speaking. - Yes, what's it? Police was chasing a car with three persons in it. The car met an accident and all three were killed. Police suspects, one of them was Ajay Mehra. No! No! Hello! Hello! Trace the number she's dialing. She dialed commissioner's home. - Commissioner! Hello! Hello! Can I talk to Ajay? Hello. Yes Varsha! Varsha! Speak up, Varsha! Varsha. Hello. - AjayQ What's the matter, Varsha? - Ajay, I.. Just now I received a call that you.. O my God! Hello! Hello! - Ajay! Ajay! Could she be in some trouble? Come on! Ask all nearby police stations to surround commissioner's home I'm going there. There should be no lapse of any kind. Nobody should fire. Still time to surrender. If you think we're committing a crime by killing Balwant Rai... then open the door after we leave, else wait till sunset. We'll wait till sunset son. Varsha told us everything. My and all mothers' blessings are with you. Hurry HP! Hurry UP- Run! Run! Ajay you go. He's alright. Catch him. Don't move! Nothing will happen. I say surrender or you'll be killed. You and all those who're with Balwant Rai will be killed. No inspector, I'm not animal like Balwant. I'm not murderer. I can't take anybody's life without reason. I can't If you've been wronged - I'll get you justice. Your whole system is under his foot - they're his slaves. Do you know whose life you're guarding? What he is? Playing with people's lives is his profession. You forget about me and use all police force to save his life. But he won't survive - I'll kill him. I'll kill him today. Be careful. Varsha. Varsha! Come Mr. Ajay. We knew you'll come here. Varsha is in our custody. It's a game. Sometime you win, sometime we. I'd told you Sharma. If you leave me alive, you'll repent. Tell me where's Varsha? Yari road. Old fort. Rajan.. There's mourning in the streets. - The killers are rulers! There's mourning in the streets. - The killers are rulers! There's mourning in the streets. - The killers are rulers! There's mourning in the streets. - The killers are rulers! Move! Inspector Sharma! No! I've written everything about Balwant Rai. But, you'll save me. - Police is with you. I don't want to die inspector. - Don't worry. Sign it. You've no shame. He gunned down an officer, you couldn't arrest Now we should get special force for our own security, isn't it? Today he killed inspector Sharma and tomorrow... Don't call him inspector sir, Sharma was a criminal. What do you want to say? Sir, this is the statement of Balwant Rai's secretary. This is the record of their illegal dealings. This is the ugly face of that great personality. Our inspector Sharma was working for Balwant Rai. And instead of arresting we're trying to protect him. Why haven't police acted against him sir. Enough! D'Souza. Truth is bitter. And it's also true that I know everything. It's not that I haven't tried. Whenever I tried, I'd to bow before big powers. His reach is up to the top. Don't forget e aren't the whole system - we're its small part. Our rights are just a facade. Nothing is in our control... That means Ajay Mehra is not the culprit. We are! And our rotten legal system is the culprit. Ajay Mehra is the outcome of dysfunctional legal system. If he had got the justice - all this would not have happened. And we can't put an end to this by capturing and killing Ajay. Whenever law murders justice - a new Ajay will be borne. Excuse me sir, but instead of helping such law... I prefer to take off my uniform and support Ajay. No D'Souza. This department needs your kind of officers. And I'm grateful for awakening my sleepy conscious. We'll act against Balwant Rai. We'll have him punished - but according to the law. Before that we must stop Ajay from committing another crime. I promise to do my best for Ajay in the court. Promise. I don't know... How many times will you ask? I don't know where Ajay is. And if I knew, I would not have told you. In fact I was in search of his special weakness. I've his most beautiful weakness in my hands. Now I don't need to find him. He'll come on his own. Whetherl reach him, or he reaches me - result is the same His death. He'll come. He'll surely come. And he'll bring such an storm... which will destroy your death factory like a house of sand. You too know this. Because I see fear of death in your eyes. Come out Balwant Rai. You enjoy seeing others die. And you're hiding when your death is standing before you. Come on out, you dog! You beast! Balwant Rai! Ajay, stop! Ajay, stop! Ajay! Fire. Hey, this is Balwant Rai. He is a big smuggler. - He was mentioned in today's newspaper. Fire! Stop there. Nobody will move. Move! - No! Move! Leave my child. - Move, else I'll shoot him. Ajay. Come out. I'll shoot this child. I'll shoot everybody. I'll count up to three. One! - Leave me. Two! Three! Move! Move out of the way! Leave him! Leave him! - Ajay! No! Leave him! Ajay! Ajay, leave him! Ajay, leave him. Ajay! Ajay! Listen to me, Ajay! Ajay, leave him! Let go of him. What are you doing? Leave him. Ajay. ' No! Ajay, let him die at the hands of the law. Ajay! Ajay, don't be a fool. Take him away. Take him away. Hurry! Ajay. Get aside. Leave him. Ajay! Leave him. Don't hit him. Ajay! Move back. Ajay! No! Get aside from the way, I say. Move.
