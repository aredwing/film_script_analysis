I just love Christopher Wilde. 'Cause you're in the top spot And nothing can stop ya And nothing can stop ya Jessica! Oh, I'm sorry, Sara. Am I blocking your view of what's his name? Move it or lose it, sister. Sara, Jessica. Suitcases. Come pick out your clothes and get packed. We're leaving for the airport right after school tomorrow. In less than 24 hours, I'll be in Los Angeles where Christopher lives. What if he picks me up at the airport? Why would he do that? I'm an original member of his fan club. I follow his minute-by-minute blog posts, and I text him every day. Trust me, he wants to meet me. Is it too late for me to be an only child? - Yes. - Then can I please stay home? - No. - Why not? Because your grandmother hasn't seen you in two years. Plus, you're a minor and it's illegal. Everybody... There's more about Christopher. The fabulous Christopher Wilde picked up six Music Association Awards last night, just in time for his new CD, Real Wilde, to drop, wow, double platinum. I caught up with our favourite pop star on the red carpet. Well, first I'd love to say thank you so much for buying the records and coming to my concerts. You're the reason I love what I do. You guys are the best fans in the world. Thank you. He is such an amazing person. He's definitely not amazing. He is amazing. And if you knew him like I know him, you wouldn't say that. Hello? We live in Michigan. You don't know him. But I do. I know everything about him. I know where he works, eats, shops, surfs, and parties. - You ready to party? - Absolutely. Well, let's do it! You know, out of all of your cars, Angelina's my favourite. - Angelina? - Yeah. I mean, look at her. Hey, does that new valet look a little shifty to you? - No. Not really. - He looks a little shifty to me. Come on, Stubby. Let's find you a real girl. That is a real girl. Oh, wow. Look who it is. Christopher Wilde's girlfriend, the fantabulous, fabulous Alexis Bender! - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. - Stubby. - Yeah. You look beautiful tonight. I know. Wait until you see what I'm wearing tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow? My birthday? Baby, you promised you were gonna sing. Right. Hey, I'll be there. Absolutely. Okay. Wait. - Something's wrong. - Yeah, you're here. What? It's guys' night out! Where are the paparazzi? Oh, you did not blog again, did you? There he is. Let's run. That's so weird. Hi. - Look right here. - Just like that. All right, back-back up, guys. Back... Back up! Back up! Okay, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up! - Come on. - What? Calm down. You're not invited. Everybody's invited, Sara. It's an all-school dance. The operative word being "dance." Embarrassing. Don't worry. I'm just going there to cover it for the school paper. Are you bringing your camera with you to California? AJ, of course I am. Because we still need pics of Christopher Wilde! Talking, walking, singing, dancing, moving, breathing. Why are you both so hung up on this guy? "This guy"? - Now you see what I live with? - Poor you. Little sister, when we go to California, you can play shuffleboard with Grandma, but I'm going to meet Christopher Wilde. And just how are you planning to do that? Well, we've mapped out his every move for the past 18 months. I know when and where he's likely to be every second of every day. About the time we leave for Los Angeles, he'll be having his daily meeting with his managers. - He's late. - He'll be here. You need to manage him better. Hello, we both manage him. He needs to know opportunities like this don't come every day. He knows. He's not a kid. Yo. What's up? - You're late. - Sorry, Mom. How you doing, Son? Great, great. Excited. Oh, honey, honey, honey. You could have cleaned up a little bit. What? I'm... I'm totally clean. He looks like a street kid, not a movie star. He looks fine. Just be yourself, Christopher. All right. He's here. All right. This is it, bud. Your chance at what we've always wanted. - Alan, please come in. - Sherry. Daniel! - Great place you got here. - Actually it's Christopher's. We just kind of work here. - All right. Christopher Wilde. - Hey, Mr Smith. - My daughters are big fans of yours. - Oh, great. - Wow! This is great. - Please. I love this. I love this. Rock and roll! Hello, Cleveland! Awesome. Got this album at the house. Girls love this. Something Wilde. All right, now let's get right to the point. Let's get right to it. I've been watching you and I like what I see. You are a talented, talented kid. He's a talented kid. You sing, you dance. I hope you can act. Because I like you for this movie. Thank you, sir. I mean, coming from you, this would be such an honour to... I mean, to work with someone... But my people don't necessarily agree with me. See, all they see is a spoiled punk who likes to tangle with the paparazzi. Alan, you know how the tabloids are. They manipulate those photos to... Daniel, I get it. I get it. Look, all I'm saying, kid, is a chance like this comes along once in a lifetime, and I want to give you a shot, but you have to prove that you're a serious and committed actor. How do I do that? On Monday, I'm gonna meet with my people, try and sell them on you. In the meantime, you keep your face out of the tabloids. No press, good or bad. Okay? - I can do that. - In fact, stay home. - All right. - Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. You're such a dork. You brought homework? No. It's called reading. You should try it sometime. What? I read. This? It's all pictures. Don't touch that! Gladly. What's taking them so long? Just get me a car already so I can go meet Christopher Wilde. Sara. You can't drive. Yes, I can. Licence. No, you can't. Sign. "You must be at least "or rent a car from Los Angeles Car Rental"? What? How am I supposed to do what I wanna do? And what would that be? Take Jessica sightseeing. Well, I think your grandma's got a car you can borrow. Sweet. See what I mean? Mom, be careful! Here comes the cavalry. You could fall and break a hip. Oh, now, Barbara. Calm down. Howard had my back. Hi. We take care of each other. Okay then. - Grandma! - Jessica! Oh, I'm so happy to see you. - I've missed you so much. - Ditto. Sara. You can take her for a spin if you want to. Just gave her a tune-up. She runs like a top. Yeah, a super-ugly top you'd never want to be seen in. Does that mean you'll be joining us for shuffleboard? Sara out! Grandma says stop pacing. You're creating a draught. I just got a call from AJ. She just had a chat about a text quoting a blog about Christopher Wilde. He's singing tonight at Alexis Bender's birthday party. I have to go! Good luck convincing Mom and Dad of that. - Go with me. - No. They'll let me go if you go, too. How many times do I have to say this? I'm not interested in meeting a stupid celebrity. I mean, I am sick and tired of Christopher Wilde. - He's all you talk about. - I'll shut up. - What? - If you go with me, and I meet Christopher Wilde, I'll stop talking about him for the rest of the trip. How about the rest of your life? Please? What are you doing? This is a no-parking zone. When one person stays in the car, it's not parking. It's waiting. We'll get a ticket. Just get behind the wheel! - Do it! - Okay! Every boy, every girl They got your posters on their wall, yeah! I don't know about this, man. - Nah, it'll be fine. - We shouldn't even be here. I mean, we should be at home, chilling at that party your parents are throwing. Since when do you want to party with my parents? Are you kidding? The caterer's from Argentina. There's gonna be steak for dessert. Tempting, but I promised Alexis I'd sing at her birthday. - I'm not going to let her down. - You and your stupid friendship rules! Yeah, they work for you, don't they? Stay at my house for free, eat my food, drive my cars... Okay, okay. And in return, you get to hang out with myself, Albert J. Stubbins. Best friend since fourth grade. Yeah. Works for me, too, Stubs. Let's do this. He's here. Just stay here. Alexis! Baby! Happy Birthday. - Where's Christopher? - He couldn't make it. - He's at home eating steak. - Alexis, where's your boyfriend? Come on. Let's go have some fun. - Stubby! - What? I'm so sorry I'm late! Come on! - Do you know her? - Not yet. Great. I'm gonna be here forever. Thanks. Looks like we pulled it off. What would you do without me?

Just make sure her sister Sara gets home okay. Just don't tell anyone about this. I got to get some new shoes! Follow the light with your eyes. Well, I've done a thorough exam, and the CT scan was normal. Everything looks good. - So she's okay? - Out. There's no sign of head trauma, and I'm absolutely certain you don't have a concussion. How come I threw up? Maybe it was something you ate. Or maybe it was a reaction to meeting that doofus. It's a curtain, Sanjay. I can hear you. No, no, you can't. - You two know each other? - Yeah. He's my sister's husband. So I can go now? Yes, but I want you to put an ice pack on that bump until you get home. - I'll be right back. - Okay. - You gonna answer that? - Oh, right. Just... Hello, Mom? What? Who? Where? Now? Yes! Right now! We thought he wasn't coming, but he just showed up with your two biggest fans. Look, you promised him you were gonna stay home this weekend. It's up to you to fix this, Christopher. Okay. Just stall them. I will be right there. - Sherry! - Alan! Where is he? - That might be a problem. - Why? My waiting room is filled with big guys with big cameras. You... The paparazzi found me? Okay, Sanjay, what kind of car you driving? Nothing you'd be interested in. I'm still paying off six years of medical school. - Perfect. How about a trade? - No. Only happens once. Okay. Are you sure this is safe? I'm pretty sure. - I'm pretty sure it's not! - Just calm down, okay? I don't wanna calm down! I wanna go home! Okay? - What is wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? Nothing. Nothing. I'm looking forward to being grounded until I'm 30! Oh, is that why you're so crabby? - I'm not crabby! - Not crabby. Defensive. - I am not defensive. - See? You disagree with everything I say. - Do not! - Do, too! - Just take me home! - I will! First we need to make one teeny-tiny little stop. You've got to be kidding. - You live here? - Yeah, why? - Go, go. Let's go. - What are you doing? Got to go upstairs. Got to go. - Stop pulling me! - I'm sorry. I just... Where are we going? Christopher! - I'm sorry. I just don't know... - Don't know where to hide me? No, I'm not hiding you. It's just that I don't want these particular people to see you right now. And because I'm not a movie star. No! Okay, because I don't want anyone asking questions and neither do you. Who is she? Where did you meet her? Are you two dating? - Dating? - Yeah, they make stuff up. Come on. The guestroom. Be my guest. - Do I have a choice? - Not really. I'll be right back. Just stay. Woof. Good to see you.

Great. So, girls, am I the greatest Dad in the world or what? Hey! Where you going? Anywhere but here. What did I do now? You said you'd take me home. When? Just pick a car. I'll take you home. - No! - Fine, we'll walk. - Where does Grandma live again? - Hollywood. Oh, that's great. We'll get there on Tuesday. - Okay. - Okay? But here are the rules. You drive me straight there, drop me off, and then you come back to your fabulous life. What's the purpose of that? I don't get it. Why does she do this? There's something about the sunshine, baby I'm seeing you in a whole new light Really? What? I thought you'd like it. Let me guess. You thought I'd be dying to ride in a car with Christopher Wilde as he sings to one of his big hits. A fan's dream come true! There's just one problem. - Which is? - I'm not your fan. You don't... You don't like my music? No, I like your music. I'm just not crazy about you. - But you don't even know me. - Precisely. You know, I think if you... I think if you did know me, - you'd really like me. - Turn here. - Thanks for the ride. - Hey, look, Jessica. Look, I just wanna say I'm sorry. Noted. Are we done now? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess we're done. - Good. Okay, bye. Oh, great. Go away. Look, I'll give you $5,000 if you do me this favour. It's not a favour if you pay for it. So is that a yes? You know, you can help a little. No, this car wouldn't be moving if I wasn't pushing it. You'll be out of here before morning, right? Yes. Hopefully no one will ever know I was here. I'll know. - Thank you. Thanks a lot. - Yeah. Hey, is there anything up there that I can wear so when I do leave, the paparazzi won't recognise me? You can look in those. So, is all this really necessary? Yes. Clearly you don't understand. They're everywhere. Paranoid. You know what? Just forget it. Love to. Well? That was my grandpa's hat. He used to wear it when he took me fishing. Oh, wow. I'm sorry. Here. No. You keep it. It looks kind of good on you. Thanks. Anything else? No. No, I'm cool. Yeah. So cool you're sleeping in your car. Jessica. - Stop doing that! - What am I doing? Oh, you know exactly what you're doing. In fact, I bet you do it all the time. You give girls that look and expect them to fall for you. Well, it's not working with me, so get over it! Eat up. We're helping Grandma with some yard work today. - Morning, sunshine. - Hey. - Syrup, please. - I didn't see any. - Mom, got any more syrup? - Oh, sure. On the shelf in the garage. I'll get it. No. I'll get it. - How was your little cab ride? - What cab ride? What cab ride? I am this close to meeting Christopher Wilde, and I have to leave because Stubby tells me that you decided to take a cab home. Oh, that cab. Where did you go? Wait. Don't tell me. I don't wanna be that bored. I'll make it up to you. I'll help you find him. How are you going to do that? Let's go... Let's go inside and research. Mom and Dad don't even need to know. Mom and Dad don't need to know what? - Nothing. - Nothing. I don't understand you girls. - Oh, that's wonderful. - Yeah, great. Oh, Sara. They're doing a story on television about that boy you like so much. In there. Yeah. - No! - What is with you? I don't... Alexis Bender arrived at her birthday party last night without her leading man. Although no one saw him arrive at the fabulous Club Under 21, witnesses confirm that Christopher Wilde did indeed make a secret appearance to sing for the packed house of well-wishers. Partygoers say the pop star left the club immediately following his performance, only to magically reappear at his Beverly Hills mansion several hours later with a different girl. My sources tell me this mystery girl might be stealing the heart of our favourite pop star. Stop! I wanna see that! Why? It's all lies. Technically, slander. Why do you care? You don't even like him. I care about the truth. And I'm pretty sure that's not it. - Girls, knock it off. - I know what. It's a beautiful day. Here. Take the keys to my car, and go to the beach. Really? Thanks, Grandma. Take Jessica with you. Go. I thought we were going to Venice. Why are we in Malibu? Because Christopher Wilde surfs in Malibu. Today's the day. I can feel it. He's here somewhere. I doubt that. I just hope he's not with Alexis Bender, who, IMHO, is totally not cute enough for him. I wonder what his eyes look like. Up close. Blue. Really blue. Excuse me. Is this seat taken? No? Okay. What a beautiful day. Isn't it a beautiful day? Oh, I'm sorry. You were sleeping. Did I wake you? No? Oh, then you're awake. Good. Would you put some sunscreen on my back? - How did you know it was me? - The hat. Does kind of smell like fish. No, I'm pretty sure that's you. Now, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Go home. - I tried. - And? Nah, you wouldn't understand. So you think you're so special that a nobody like me couldn't possibly understand how hard it is to be you? Okay. There were about 10 paparazzi parked outside my house with their cameras. Yeah, that is tough. Not. See, you don't understand. I just need to get home in a car the paparazzi won't recognise. So what are you driving? Oh, you'd love it. It's a classic. Really vintage. Perfect. I could pay you. - I know that's kind of... - Stop that! - Stop what? - Throwing your money around. I mean, you still owe me five grand for staying at Garage de la Grandma. - Just give me your keys. - Why? Well, if you're taking our car, you can't leave us here without one. Keys. Come on. Okay, look, she's a... She's a 300 and... Three hundred and thirty-five horsepower, first generation '69 Tudor with original paint. Look, I love Cher, okay? Cher? You name your cars? Christopher, meet Petunia. You've got to be kidding me. She runs like a top. Have her back here in an hour. Down. Get down. I can't believe it. How do they know where to find me? My sister knows where to find you, and she's from Kalamazoo. All right, here. Put these on. He's probably under an umbrella. Look under an umbrella. - Now! - Okay. All right. Get in the car. He's got to be around here, all right. Okay, you really need to stop hitting me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just get in. Get in. Get in! Quick, buckle up. Put your head down. - Put your head down. Head down. - It's down. - What are you doing? - I'm looking for something. Here, put this on. - What... Why? - Do it now! - Come on. - Okay. You know what? You drive like my grandpa. And you look like my grandma. - Okay. - I need my sunglasses back. I don't know. I kind of like them. - I'll give them to you. Later. - For reals? Because my friends just won't believe that I, Jessica Olson, have an actual pair of Christopher Wilde sunglasses worn by Christopher Wilde himself. Will you autograph them for me? - Very funny. - What? No, but seriously. I really want these glasses. Give them. Come on. So, how long do I have to drive around with you this time? Only until the paparazzi leave the beach. - Hey, let's go do something. - Like what? Anything. What have you seen since you've been here? Nothing. I've been too busy following you around. - Really? - With my sister. She idolises you. I mean, I, on the other hand, couldn't care less about you or your city. Well, I know you don't like me, but don't take it out on Los Angeles. This is one of the greatest cities in the world. - Really? - In fact, I'll be your tour guide. I thought you needed to get home. Nah. Take the long way. Wake up to the blue sky Grab your shades and let's go for a ride Breakfast by the ocean We'll do lunch at Sunset and Vine - Every day's a dream in California - Every day's a dream in California - Every night the stars come out to play - Every night the stars come out to play - Wish that I could always - Wish that I could always - Feel this way - Feel this way - There's something about - There's something about - the sunshine, baby - the sunshine, baby - I'm seeing you in a whole new light - I'm seeing you in a whole new light - Outta this world for the first time, baby - Outta this world for the first time, baby - Oh, it's so right - Oh, it's so right - There's something about the sunshine - There's something about the sunshine - There's something about the sunshine - There's something about the sunshine In Hollywood, we're rockin' In Malibu, we hang out and chill It's all about the shopping From Melrose to Beverly Hills - Everywhere's a scene - Everywhere's a scene - and now we're in it - and now we're in it - I don't want to paint this town alone - I don't want to paint this town alone - When I see you smile - When I see you smile - I always feel at home - I always feel at home - There's something about - There's something about - the sunshine, baby - the sunshine, baby - I'm seeing you in a whole new light - I'm seeing you in a whole new light - LA 's a breeze - LA 's a breeze - with the palm trees swayin' - with the palm trees swayin' - Oh, it's so right - Oh, it's so right Now that you're here Now that you're here It's suddenly clear It's suddenly clear - The sun's coming through - The sun's coming through - I never knew - I never knew - Whatever I do - Whatever I do - It's better with you - It's better with you It's better with you Yeah, yeah There's something about the sunshine, baby There's something about it - I'm seeing you in a whole new light - Whole new light - Outta this world for the first time, baby - Baby - Oh, it's so right - Oh, it's so right So right - Something about the sunshine, baby - Something about the sunshine, baby - I'm seeing you in a whole new light - I'm seeing you in a whole new light - Outta this world for the first time, baby - Outta this world for the first time, baby - Oh, it's so right - Oh, it's so right There's something about the sunshine, baby I'm seeing you in a whole new light - LA 's a breeze - LA 's a breeze - with the palm trees swayin' - with the palm trees swayin' What a perfect day.

This isn't even a road any more. This is a firebreak, it has to be. Just... Just keep driving. That last sign said "Deer crossing." There are no deer. You know, you complain more than my sister. Are we on the right road or not? - Not? - Show it to me. No! Keep your eyes on the road. I'm the navigator. Is that what you call it? - What's that supposed to mean? - It means you're such a know-it-all. - A what? - A know-it-all! God, you are the queen of snap judgements. "Turn here! This is the right road! I'm sure of it!" - I was sure of it. - You're sure. You're so sure of things you couldn't possibly be sure about. - I am not. - And you're defensive. Move the car! We're not moving. Great. We'll have to get out and push. - Wait, wait, wait. Look, I'll help you. - Don't touch me. - Why are you so mad? - I don't know. This. Look, turning onto this road was not my idea. - You're blaming me? - Yeah, you're a terrible navigator! - You're a terrible driver! - Hey, I'm a great driver. Right. - Jess, we're gonna have to jump. - I'm not jumping. - You got a better idea? - Use the branch as a bridge. - It does not look stable. - It looks fine. All right. Here goes. All right. It's sinking and making noises. - Go faster. - Okay! This is my grandma's car! I understand that. Just give me your hand. You okay? Grab the branch! Grab the branch! - Excuse you. - You killed Petunia! Well... Yeah. My backpack! Don't just stand there. Help me! Here. Here. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. - Come on. - I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm gonna die, that's what's gonna happen, 'cause my parents are gonna kill me. Why did I have to get in that stupid car with you? - Answer your phone! - Okay. Sorry. - Dad? - Yeah... Son? Can you hear me? - Hello? - We are a little worried over here and... Can you hear me? Dad? There's no signal. Can you hear me? Christopher, come home, honey, okay? Or call us. Do you... Hello? Hello? Look at this! When we get out of here, you're paying for a new one. I'm paying for it right now. - Jess. - What? Where are you going? To the beach where my sister is probably freaking out right now. - Jess? - What? Beach is that way. Please. Christopher John Wilde. Come on. Am I being Punk'd? - Hey, how you doing? You okay? - Now you're concerned? You know, I've always been concerned. - Maybe you should stop. - Why are you so grumpy? I'm not grumpy or cranky or crabby! I just wanna get home to my family, explain why I disappeared, and suffer the consequences. You want to know what I want? I wanna have fun. Okay, for the first time in years, there's no reporters, there's no interviews, there's no crowds. I'm having a great time. I want you to stop complaining so I can enjoy it! Wow, so that's what it's like with you? You don't get what you want so you throw a big ol' tantrum and walk away? You know, I'll bet your friends chase after you when you do that. Christopher, I'm so sorry I hurt your delicate little feelings. Christopher, forgive me for not treating you like the big enormous star you think you are. What a brat. I'm a brat? I'm a brat? What about you, huh? - Me? - Yeah. Over the last two days, I've done nothing but think about you. Really? So when you hit me with a door twice, hid me in your house, wrecked my grandma's car and dropped me in mud, you were just being thoughtful? - I pity your friends. - You wish you were one. I'd rather go down with Petunia. You know what, I'm confused about something. What? Okay, when we were on our little photography tour, - I thought you liked me. - You thought wrong. But everyone likes me. Why is it that you don't like me? Maybe because you think everybody likes you. - It's 'cause I'm likeable. - No, because you're a star. - What does that mean? - You don't even see it, do you? Your life isn't real. You park in no-parking zones, you never have to wait in line, you buy anything you want, anytime. Your house is like a hotel. You have so many people working for you, and I'll bet you don't even know their names. - Do, too. - Name one. - Bob. - You just made that up. Well, okay, Stubby knows everybody. That's his job. See, that's not normal. Okay, your best friend is your driver, your parents are on your payroll, and your girlfriend... I mean, real people date someone because they want to be with them. Why are you with Alexis? That's all I'm saying. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Stop. What... Are you saying I'm not a real person? Because I am. I stand corrected. Well, all right. Well, what if I told you something about me that no one else knew? You collect your toenails in a peanut butter jar? - No. What... No. - Then what? Well, from the first day I met you, I just... Whoa! Christopher! - I can't swim. - No. - Gotcha! - What? You're evil. - You deserved it. - You're so evil. - You're gonna get it. - You can try. Get over here. No. Come on. - Got you. - I'm gonna get you. - This is nice, isn't it? - Man. I wish I could just stay here where no one can find me. Why? 'Cause they all want something from me. A performance, or an interview, or a photograph. - Even your parents? - That's complicated. You know, sometimes I feel like they only care about the business - of "Christopher Wilde." - I'm sure that's not true. I don't know. I feel like all we talk about right now is this movie deal. They think it's my next big career move, so... Well, what do you think? Think if I get the offer, I have to take it. - What about your tour? - What about it? Well, 30 countries, 12 weeks. One million screaming fans. I mean, I'm not an expert or anything, but it seems like a lot, the tour and the movie at the same time. I don't have a choice. Everyone has a choice. What do you wanna do? Well, I know what I don't wanna do. I don't wanna disappoint anybody. Especially my fans. I wouldn't be where I am without them, so... I just never say no. To anything. Maybe I don't understand. - What? - Your life. I mean, it's so different from mine. Everything you do and say is so big and public. Not everything. Right now, here with you, I feel like I can just be myself. Not Christopher Wilde. Not famous. Just... You know, just me. - How do you like it? - I like it a lot. Me, too. So tell me something about you. - What do you wanna know? - Everything. That could take a while. I live a very exciting life. You're doing it again. - Doing what? - That thing with your eyes. You mean this? Okay, so comedy? Not your next big career move. What? No, I'm funny. - Funny-looking. - You like me. You wish. We should go. Yeah. Come on. Stubby? Whoa. Sara? What are you doing here? That's not good. - We made it. - Yeah. Yeah. - Look, I had a really great time today. - Me, too. You're so different from any other girl I've ever known. - Different weird, different annoying? - Different surprising. In the best way. I mean, you say things to me everyone else is afraid to say, and you make me see things about myself that I can't see. - You're pretty surprising, too. - Really? How? Well, for one thing, you're a terrible driver, which is strange for a guy with six cars. I'm wounded. Do you really think I'm bossy? No. I think you're amazing. I think you're amazing, too. What are you doing? That was close. Okay. Back to the real world. You know what happens next, right? - No. - This ends here. - What does? - This. Us. You can't tell anybody about what happened today. Not even your parents. Why? They're not gonna go post it on their blog or anything. Look, if we go down there, if we get photographed together, it'll get crazy. - And I won't get this movie deal. - Why does it have to get crazy? Because I'm Christopher Wilde. You're just an ordinary girl. I have to go now. Wait, Jess! Jess! Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. What just happened? You tell me. One second I'm amazing and the next you're embarrassed to be seen with me? - Jess, I'm not embarrassed... - Really? If I was Alexis Bender, you'd rush right down there and make sure somebody took our picture. - But, no, I'm just an ordinary girl! - That is not what I meant. Look, I meant you're normal. I want you to stay that way. Right. Just leave me alone. Jess. Stop. Please. What? The pictures you took. Of us. I should probably keep them. - You want my camera? - Just in case. I wouldn't want the pictures to, you know, get out. Fine. You want my pictures? Here. There's nothing I'd wanna remember anyway. I need cab fare to get home. - I'm going to Hollywood, not Hawaii. - Just keep it. I still owe you for my stay at Garage de la Grandma. Jess, wait. I don't wanna say goodbye like this. Okay, how about this? How about we both forget this whole day ever happened? You won't talk about me and I promise I won't talk about you. Go ahead and judge me, okay, but you don't know what it'll be like. The paparazzi never go away. And once they have you in their sights, they won't quit until they get what they want. And when they finally get it, they'll turn it into something ugly. They'll ruin everything. They don't have to. You already did. I'm no superman I can't take your hand And fly you anywhere you wanna go, yeah I can't read your mind Like a billboard sign And tell you everything you wanna hear But I'll be your hero 'Cause I, I can be everything you need If you're the one for me Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable I, yeah, I believe in destiny I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul But if you're the one for me Then I'll be your hero Could you be the one Could you be the one for me? Then I'll be your hero Could you be the one Could you be the one Could you be the one for me? Then I'll be your hero Searching high and low Trying every road But if I see your face how will I know, yeah I'll put my trust in fate That you will come my way And if it's right, it's undeniable, yeah I'll be your hero I, I can be everything you need If you're the one for me Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable I, yeah, I believe in destiny I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul But if you're the one for me Then I'll be your hero Could you be the one Could you be the one Could you be the one for me? I'll be your hero Could you be the one Could you be the one Could you be the one for me? I'll be your hero So incredible Some kind of miracle That when it's meant to be I'll become a hero, oh So I'll wait, wait, wait, wait for you Yeah, I'll be your hero I, I could be everything you need If you're the one for me Like gravity, I'll be unstoppable I, yeah, I believe in destiny I may be an ordinary guy with heart and soul But if you're the one for me Then I'll be your hero Could you be the one Could you be the one Could you be the one for me? Then I'll be your hero Could you be the one Could you be the one for me? Then I'll be your hero That was great, Chris. Take five. Thanks, guys. That was great. Let's take a break. All right, man. - Good job, guys. Yeah. - Hey, wait up. Yo. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I just can't get her out of my mind. Yeah, me neither. She cacked all over my shoes. I mean, she's real, you know? She's annoyingly honest, she's smart, she's cool, she's funny, she's beautiful. Yeah. Hello, boys. Talking about me? Dude. - Look, Alexis, I can explain... - I don't want to know who she is. Is she an actress? Is she more famous than me? No. No, she's not an actress. She's not famous at all. Then I really don't understand why you would pick her. I didn't pick her. It just kind of happened. Silly. That kind of stuff only happens in the movies. This is the real world. I have a date with Zac. I have to go. Whoa. Are you breaking up with me? Okay. - Friends? - Sure. - Bye, Grandma. I love you. - Goodbye, Sara. I love you more. - You sure you're gonna be okay, Mom? - Yes, Barbara. And you mustn't believe what you read about old folks. - Howard and I are gonna be just fine. - I can see that. - Love you. - Love you. Love you. And how about you, Jess? Are you gonna be all right? Sweetheart. I know it hurts right now, but things are not always what they seem in the moment. Given some time, life has a way of working itself out for the better. - Really, Grandma? - Yup. I mean, look at me. I've been trying to get rid of that ugly old car since your grandpa died. - Honey. - I love you, Grandma. I love you, sweetheart. - Bye, Howard. - Take care, sweetheart. You, too. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Bye, everybody! Jessica Olson. - Such a nice name for a nice girl. - Where'd you get that? Where do you think I got it, Christopher? Libby Lam has had a whole fleet of photographers on you - for the past two days. - I know, but I was so careful. Now, this is exactly the kind of thing I was afraid of with you, kid. I mean, you're obviously not serious about doing this movie. I don't know, maybe you're just too young. No, sir. Look, I made a mistake. Come on, Alan. Give us a chance to fix this. All right, all right. Make the story go away. - How do we do that? - You call Libby Lam. You offer her an exclusive. You say you don't know this girl. You say she's just some fan who was following you around all day. - You want me to lie? - Christopher! This is the tabloid press, dude. This is not the Supreme Court. Say whatever you have to say, because I promise you, either this girl goes away or the movie does. Okay? Goodbye. So we're talking about this girl, Jessica Olson. - Yeah, she looks kind of familiar. - Come on, Christopher. We know you were at the beach with her. Look, lots of fans come to Malibu to watch me surf, and I try to say hi to everybody that comes up to me, but... Please. Maybe I signed an autograph for her or something. Excuse us. It's okay. According to our sources, she came all the way from Kalamazoo, Michigan, just to see you. - Coming through. Enough of that. - Wow, really? I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to meet her. Going inside. You have to talk to us, Jess. What happened out there in California? Nothing bad, I promise. I can't talk about it. Please, please, just trust me. Christopher Wilde is talking about you on Starstruck! So you're saying that you don't know this girl. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what she's saying about me, but I don't know anybody named Jessica Olson. Sorry, Libby, there's nothing more to tell. Okay. You heard it here first. I'm Libby Lam. This is Starstruck News. I can't believe they're still out there. Why don't they just go home? Because they haven't got what they came for yet. You know, you should just go talk to them. I mean, you're already all over the Internet. - I am? - Yeah! There's like a whole website devoted to what people think about Chrissica. "Chrissica"? Wow. You really shouldn't read any of these. Wait, wait, here's a good one. "That Jessica Olson chick is a real nut, dude. "She just wants to be famous. She should get a life because she..." Guys, stop. Just stop. Maybe it's the phrasing or the tempo. Something's not right. - Yo, what's up with you, man? - I don't know. You want to know what I think? Sure you do. I think you're still torn up about Jessica. No. I'm good. I'm over her. All my life people telling me just who I am They don't wanna know They don't really understand Too many people trying to tell me to be practical Only think that I am one-dimensional But I can feel it There's a fire raging underneath Burning through the pages here I am coming clean I'm sick of lying to myself Gotta live the truth Now I gotta do what I gotta do This is where I should be There ain't no other place, yeah Where my soul really speaks There ain't no other way I can feel it save me, move me, shake me Gotta go where the music takes me Let it set me free You got to believe Is it a crime to just be who I wanna be? I need some space so that I can chase all my dreams 'Cause when I hit the stage anything is possible I get lost in the song and that is magical So crank it up, feel the rush then just turn me loose I wanna feel the inspiration that is coming through And there's no other place where I feel so alive When I start to sing you just can't deny This is where I should be There ain't no other place, yeah Where my soul really speaks There ain't no other way I can feel it save me, move me, shake me Gotta go where the music takes me Let it set me free You got to believe When everybody's gone And I'm here all alone I don't gotta hide I don't have to try You got to understand That this is who I am And it's where I shine And it's where I shine, I know This is where I should be There ain't no other place, yeah Where my soul really speaks There ain't no other way I can feel it save me, move me, shake me Gotta go where the music takes me Let it set me free You got to believe This is where I should be There ain't no other place, yeah Where my soul really speaks There ain't no other way I can feel it move me Gotta go where the music takes me Let it set me free Let it set me free Let it set me free You got to believe You are definitely not over her. - Okay, they need to go now. - I thought you liked being on TV. Yeah, but I need to buy a dress for the dance, and they're blocking my car. Christopher said this would happen. He said it would get crazy. Celebrities might have to put up with this, but I don't. Jessica! Jessica. Tell us about your weekend with Christopher Wilde. We only want the truth. You don't want the truth. You want a story. You take a good, normal person and turn him into your own little reality show. You build him up into a big celebrity just so you can tear him down in public. Just so you can sell magazines and TV shows? That's really sick. And Christopher Wilde's just one example. He's talented and successful. He has all the stuff lots of kids dream of having. But thanks to you, he's had to give up some of the best things in life. Freedom. Privacy. Honesty. So, congratulations, you've created a celebrity. But you have wrecked the human being inside. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Did you get that? Jessica. Jessica, just one more question. In your opinion, who is Christopher Wilde, really? Who is he? I don't know. The Christopher Wilde you're all so obsessed with, I promise you, I never met him, and I wouldn't want to. Didn't you say you liked her because she was so honest? - Yeah. - Wow. Congratulations, Chris. You did it. You got her to lie for you. I didn't have a choice, okay? All right. - Where are you going? - To find my best friend, 'cause he's not the guy sitting here now. - Dude, what are you talking about? - "I didn't have a choice." Lately that's been your answer to everything, man. - Really? - Yeah. Your life, your choice, man. What do you want? Cut! Guys, you nailed it. Perfect, guys. That was the one. That was perfect. Let's go one more time. Circle. Great take. Great... Christopher! Buddy. Great news. You're in. Rehearsals start on Monday. - Actually, I'm not available. - Not a problem. We'll change the date. No. I came to say, you know, thanks for the offer, but if I have to lie to be in your little club, think I'll pass. Wow. Kid's got edge. Fire. I like that. And cue the rain! Okay. He's got two weeks between Oslo and London. We could make him available for the movie then. That's tight. You know, he needs some downtime. Okay. All right. How about after Tokyo, but before Melbourne? - What's going on? - Hi, honey. Hey. We're working the movie into your tour schedule. I don't want to do the movie any more. Sweetie, don't be silly. Of course you do. We're about to make the deal, bud. Well, it's too late. I've already passed. Honey, that's not your decision. Yes, it is. I'm 17 years old. I just want to have fun and make music. Okay, okay. Hey. No worries. No worries. We'll handle it. No. No. It's time that I started managing my own life. So... You know what? You're fired. Wow. I'd really like for you to just be my parents from now on. Right. Okay, come here. Turn. It's just not girly enough. But imagine it on me. Girlier, right? - Maybe. - Why don't you just try it on yourself? Stop whining. Here. We have three hours before the dance. Go change. Kids! So what was it like to have reporters on your lawn? Exciting. But I need my privacy, too. We all watched your sister on TV, and she looked wacko. - Really? - Yeah! It was so weird the way she made up that story about meeting Christopher Wilde. She is so pathetic. Do you think she heard that? - AJ. You're an idiot. - What? - Get out. - But... Go! - Jessica. - Go away. No. I actually live here. What? Go with me to the dance. I thought I was pathetic and embarrassing. Only if you actually dance. So don't. Come on. Come on. Let's make you pretty enough to be my sister. You look good. Don't slouch. You know, Sara, in a weird way, you're a good sister. Pretend you don't know me. Lame. Oh, my God! Jessica Olson? There's some things I forgot to say to you back in California. Can't blame you For thinking That you never really knew me at all I tried to Deny you But nothing ever made me feel so wrong I thought I was protecting you from everything that I go through But I know that we got lost along the way Here I am With all my heart I hope you understand I hope you understand I know I let you down But I'm never gonna make that mistake again You brought me closer to who I really am So come take my hand I want the world to see What you mean to me What you mean to me What did you think? That you could just come here and sing to me and everything would be fine? Yes. No? No. No. Well, which is it? I just came to tell you I was wrong about everything, especially about you. - Don't you think you're a little late? - Come on. Everyone here thinks I was lying. But I'm the one who lied. I lied about knowing Jessica Olson. 'Cause the truth is I know Jessica Olson. Jessica Olson's a terrible navigator and a know-it-all, but she's honest. When she makes a promise, she keeps it. She understands me like no one else does. And I'm crazy about her. Jessica, I'm so sorry. I know that I hurt you and I will never do anything like that again. Just, please, forgive me. - Go away. Now. - Okay. Get out of here. Move it. Christopher, this is my sister, Sara. Sara, this is Christopher Wilde. Sara. Do you wanna dance with me? I think I got this one, Chrissy. You didn't have to come all the way to Michigan for this. Yeah, I did. It's not cool to ask a girl out on the phone. So, will you go out with me? On a real date. - Do I have to wear a disguise? - No. - Do you? - No. Then, yeah. I'd really like that. I almost forgot. For you. You remembered. How do I look? Like a superstar. Party up Put your hands in the sky now, yeah If you wanna get fly We can do it all night now, yeah Turn the beat up high One time for the ladies, yeah And the fellas come on We gonna go crazy Till the lights come on All night, here we go now Come on and get right on the floor now Nah, nah, baby girl, don't slow down 'Cause me and you gonna have a showdown Little mama get lowdown And I'm-a rock it out like this We movin' and groovin' smooth Can't lose with a flow that is so swift So maybe when you wake up and your face still got that grin You can smile all day in a flygirl way and say, "Yeah, I'm that chick" And maybe we can get the deejay to play this track all night And when I ask how you feel out there Everybody say... - All right! - All right!
