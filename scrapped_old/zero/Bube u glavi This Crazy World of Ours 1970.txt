That these tests are made for fools, and he's sick when he needs to give answers like one. Do you feel these sentences are stupid? Yes. Are you perhaps angry at me? I'm sorry? Are you perhaps angry at me? No. You see, it's possible that you see this as an attack at you freedom. And you're right to be angry. You should get angry.

Test is very simple, right? Yes. And now tell me why is this person so sympathetic to you? He's got moustaches and beard. Does it mean something to you? A lot. I envy you all on this rapacious screwing around. I feel too old and too serious. Everything would be more normal if I felt I could do it. Don't tell crap, my dear. Hallo? Please get me 421. Vera, please. Vera, it's Dragan. When? Alright. I say, it's alright if you can't, I've got drawing class. Class. We're drawing. Yes, on Sava. Alright. Alright, I'll call you. Bye. Dragan, what are you doing here? I've no idea. Vera, come here! Are you angry? No, I'm not angry. Actually, I'm angry at myself. I was terribly surprised to see you here.
