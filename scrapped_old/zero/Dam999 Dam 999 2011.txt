 

                        ...the mystic genesis of the universe... ...cosmic influence of stars and planets on destiny... ...the dawn of vedic era, unveiling the ultimate truth. Destiny cannot be changed. It's decided by one's deeds. Karma. It's our own karma that leads to nature's fury. Ultimately she takes her turn to destroy and to bury. What more can i say? Blogging was just a hobby for me. But her inspiration made me mould my memory... ...our memories... to this novel. With your permission, allow me to invite... ...my sweetheart, the love of my life... ...who's here to handout the very first copy of our book... ...except of course for the 10000 free copies... ...we've already given away to reviewers. And if you find it boring, the blame should definitely go over there. About the central character of this novel... ...his life is an ode to lost love. Razia called it a river of love flowing towards a sea of separation. Now for the surprise. The man who sailed across the nine seas of lost love... ...in this book is here with us today. Moreover, i'll be a part of this wonderful marine city soon. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce mr. Vinay shankar. Our romantic memoir. Call it, our biographies. In our collective memory, there's a story untold. As nine characters, nine mood and a dam of emotion. A voyage to the nine forms of lost love under... ...the cosmic influences of nine planets. I'm not elaborating much, a book is to be read. I'm sure the two of you have heard that ships are safest in the harbour. But that's not where it's meant to be. - Yes, sir. Send a request to bunk at the next port. - Okay, captain. Superintendent has called again for the reports. Sir, we'll just have to manage on some variable to dry though. Really tell him to shut up and get moving. Hear this whole ship is older than my cruise officer days. Daddy. Whose ship are we going to? To dad's old friend's ship. And where are we going to? Well, far, far away, to your dad's place. You want to see my home, son? - Yes. Your grandpa's there. - But mummy told me that grandpa went to heaven. You've got another grandpa. Oh! Two grandpas? Will mummy also come there? No. No, 8 short years, mate. Where have you been? No emails, no phone-calls, nothing! We knew that you'd immigrate somewhere proper but we'd no idea where. A long story, mate. Sam. Say hello. Hello. My name is sam and this is my octopian boy. Octopian... but wow! Sam, my name is freddie and this is my octopian girl. He's just being silly. I'm razia. Come let's go. Sam, here. What's wrong? - It's time for sam's next dose. He's got diabetes. Diabetes. It's for old people. My son's got it a bit early. Juvenile diabetes. Sam, your hand. Watch it. It's paining. So sam is really not medha's son. Yeah. Apparently, he lost her. She married some yachtsman. Where is she? He really didn't want to talk about it... ...but i know that he hasn't been home in years. Can't believe it. Here, have some coffee. Darling, you make incredible coffee. Some of the best. But i told vinay that we'll be going to... ...the seaman's club tonight and have some drinks. Sam... - i'll take care of him. "I walk away from the blue light." Freddie, memories are like wine, man. Tastes better with time. You're absolutely right, vinay. But bad memories get bitter with time. Freddie man, memories come and go, we don't have a choice. You do remember your first love. First love? I remember my first drink. Well that's what my music will make. Memories are like wine. Freddy, you tell me, what's more painful... ...unexpressed love or unrequited love? If you'd expressed it on time... ...you'd would have gotten your love. But it's too late. It's time to board. I gotta go! Vinay. The surveyor has boarded, will you make sure everything's alright? I'll have a quick round. - I'll take sam. Sam, don't trouble razia. Okay? If this ship sinks, we can escape in these lifeboats. And what if the lifeboat sinks? Good question. Well lifeboat rarely sink. And even if they do, you've your life jacket to keep you afloat. But what if the life jacket sinks? Arjit! Arjit! Don't fire the boiler, oil has accumulated on the floor? Clean that out first. Reporting. I will! Daddy! Daddy. Your daddy is busy, we'll go? Okay. Hey darling, can you please come down to ccr? I think i've a job for you. Ok, i'll be right there. Don't worry, give me an hour i'll finish the calculations. But filling those tanks partially is dangerous. It's better to fill the double-bottom tanks instead. But you've some problems with your transfer lines. Crap! Is there anything? Anything at all that works fine on this 200 year old rust bucket. Great. You 2 carry on, we'll see what's going on. Go on. This is 9 victa echo echo. There's a fire onboard. Over. We'll have to release the co2, there's no other option. - Damn it! Close the other doors. Co2 released. Over. My first co2 release experience. Yeah, me too. Crap, i've gotta give sam a shot. The fire must've broken through that... we've to lower those lifeboats - have you seen sam? Sam is sleeping in my room. He's not there. - What?! He must be somewhere around. I've looked around, he's not there. Excuse me, have you seen sam? Vinay! Vinay! Over! Roger, vinay here. Over. - Is sam with you? No, over. - Then i think you'd rather bolt. Have you seen sam? - No, i've not seen him. Sam was in the engine room. - What? He came down searching for you. No, vinay, you can't go down without the oxygen mask. Go check the bridge. Check the bridge, quick! Go to the battery room and see there... nothing? Nothing! Go forward! Forward! Both of you... both of you go to the pump room and look for sam now! Wait! Wait! Take him to the cabin. Vinay! We found him! Sam! Sam! I fell asleep. I'm so sorry, vinay. - It's alright. Man, you've tried all the available options? Almost. There's one last thing left. One last hope. What's bothering you? Sam's alright. I'm just thinking about vinay and mira. I hate tragic love stories. Well then, what kind of love stories do you love? Our kind. Really? - Yes. Why is that? Doesn't the sea look romantic? It's beautiful. But is not really half as beautiful as you look right now. I love you. - Oh lady! Let's not get too carried away with this. C'mon, let's go to bed. Carry me, my captain, i'm tired. Alright. I was thinking how it'd feel... ...to have someone lying between us. Someone we could call our own. Am i so boring? That you need somebody here with us? Besides with somebody between us, how can i hold you so closely? Things like the repairs will last for months. It'd be easier to just replace the whole engine room. It's hard to get spares for a girl that old. Freddy, i need to take some time off to go home. I don't want to delay sam's treatment. Of course, are you sure you'll be going to the right place? Like i said, my last hope. Well good. It's a weekend anyway. Bye. Hey vinay! Next week, summer palace alright? Daddy, what is that thing for? That separates the seawater from the fresh water. Where's the dam? It's very far off. Beyond our home. "Why did you leave me?" "Why did you break my heart?" "Where are you?" "No matter where you go." "My heart will follow." "And when we are together again." "Will the love return again?" "Why did you leave me?" "Why did you break my heart?" "You gave me only gift." "And that's... that are your memories." "You gave me only one memory." "And that's your love." "My heart is filled." "With your love." "Even the breeze heard everything." "That i said to the clouds." "Didn't you ever..." "...know the state of my heart through them?" "Why did you leave me?" "Why did you break my heart?" It's your place... aren't you getting down? Dad... sleeping. Shall i wake him up? He was talking about your arrival today. Mira... nothing, forget it. Take a bath. I'll get the dinner ready. What's your son's name? - Sam. Samuel. Your husband... oh! You didn't dry your hair? Daddy, wake up. Wake up, daddy! Who are you? First tell me, who are you? I'm asking you, who are you? But who are you? Blow. Blow! Son. I knew you'd come back. But i thought you'd come much earlier. See, your horoscope prediction says that your wandering period is now over. I know, you don't believe in all this. Buddha's teachings have changed me a lot, son. Where's that boy? Come here. Let me see. Blow. I'm happy that my son has come home with his son. I remember you curing a case of juvenile diabetes... diabetic. Someone will be coming from the east. Maybe snake bite. Be prepared. Sire! Sire! He's been poisoned! He's been poisoned! A viper. Scared? Your tea must be cold. Let me get you another. Did father teach you astrology too? I can't even predict my own future. That is dangerous! You do that, when there is no other option! Excellent all these injections and these tablets... ...he's such a small child. All these doctor's they just prescribe medicines. God. He cures illness. I am sorry, if i could never fulfill your dreams or follow your foot steps. He decides so. We can not change our destiny! How long are you going to be here? For a few months perhaps! You actually want to leave? I haven't decided yet! And sam's mother... ...she wasn't able to come. Show me your tongue. It will take some times treatment. Let him be here. This is his home. No? Ok! Welcome to the silver palace! This is amazing! Freak man! Marvelous! This house has exceeds all my expectations. After father's death, we are the only two actually staying here. Come on, come this way! I want to show you somthing. My great grand father! He came here to india to build this dam, dumb american settled here. It was my misfortune... ...i am not destined to be some british born to a rich woman in europe. We still have time freddie! Meet my grand father. Sir william brown... he was the first to admire this place. His game was cricket not politics. My father, john brown. My father is the man, who made the city the way you see it now. He started the construction on the dam but before he finished it... ...he was killed. He is probably constructing a dam in heaven now! This is my sister, riya brown. She was the only worry in my life. Along he invested in his t-shirt detachable frederick brown didn't inherit political powers from his father. This man, riya's husband. He became the next man. I wish i could talk to her for now. Sir. What is this, sir? Drawing up a roll. - Yes, sir. You didn't get much of this in jail, didn't you? - No, sir. I told you, you'll receive a warm reception! By the dam protestor's you are now a hero! When they requested, i couldn't say no. - How is your family? Fine sir! Brother! Did you come out on parole to spend time with... ...your family or make speeches. Sir? You were not suppose to make speeches against the dam. I'm sorry sir! You will not speak against the dam anymore! I am sorry sir! Dirty dog! I thought he would get away by killing his boss. Throw him into the bushes. You're always a witness. No wonder why. I believe your brother is in town! I was wondering whether... ...i should send him also to the bushes. Please let me go! I want to see him. No. - Please. If you will go away, who will keep my secrets? He sees you. What if you do not return? How will i win my next election with out you? I need you. You are my lucky mascot! Just like him. How long will it take for the divorce? There are some formalities to take care of. What is sandra doing now? Which he always does, shooting new stories. If your father was so worried about mira's horoscope... ...how was he able to accept her marring a foreigner? How can you absolutely know nothing about? I still don't believe this story. Father, this is... - father... i know, i know, this is rasya and this is freddy. Your friends from the marine institute. I know them. Vinay told us that you know the past, present and future. Now i'm convinced. No, vinay has told me so much about you. Love birds who crossed the border to nest! I am a bit curious. Is it possible to know our future? Astrological progressions can only give you... ...an insight to opportunities and... ...trends from the cosmic angle. Tell me your date, place and time of birth. We shall see. Because i understand that indian astrology is based on the 9 planets. But pluto's no more planet. This is also based on some misunderstanding! According to the nine star's... ...only five planets are included from the solar system. So actually it is only the sun and the moon that... ...has the maximum influence on our daily life. Much more than other bodies and planets! You believe that destiny cannot be changed! Sometimes the vibrations from the hymns of the veda... they can have some effect. That is why we have the prayers. Where is mira? Mira! See who's here? Come! Hi mira! He always talked about you! Mira did this, mira did that, never spoke of another woman. He lived with your memories mira, for years. Each and every second of it every since. Why did you ditch him? - Yes, i ditched. Not him, but my dreams. Do you anything about me? Do you know anything about my love? Nothing. Have you ever experienced the pain while sacrificing your love? But i did. I have never lived for myself. It's all my faith! I don't understand! Come. This is all he left for me. I don't know when i started loving him. Happy birthday! Thank you. Father read my horoscope and discovered that marriage would hold nothing! But tragedy and sorrow for me. He performed many rituals and prayers to try cleanse me of this curse. Vinay believed in none of it... "why did you leave me and go?" "Why did you break my heart and go away?" "Where are you now?" "Where are you?" "Wherever you will be..." "...there shall be..." she was very annoyed after vinay left for his studies. "Will we ever meet again?" "Will my lost love return to me?" How they realised how they felt about each other. He checked the compatibility of our horoscopes. He was shocked to learn that we weren't destined... ...to be together even for a day. He studied every old manuscript he could find a solution. He was not able to accept a positive disaster. I'm only saying what i'm seeing. He revealed everything to me. In the beginning i could not accept it as my fate. But i knew he was never wrong in his prediction. Whenever we tried to express our love it was followed by a tragedy. I engrossed myself in learning treatment from father! And devoted more time to practice it. Then one day... mark came to treat his psoriasis. His wife had left him because of his skin condition. Mark grew closer to me. This is a... finally he asked me to marry him. Father was surprised to see the compatibility of... ...mark's horoscope with mine. He believed that the rituals and prayers have brought me... ...this luck of one in a million chance. For me it was an exit from everything. And i said yes to mark's proposal. But i didn't know how to face vinay! How dare you invite me to your wedding? Don't you know i love you? You never told me. All my life you lived with me and you didn't know? You didn't really mean it. I have made up my mind. You made this for me. "You have given me just one gift." "That is only..." "that is only your memory." Mark was cured by then. He understood everything and left very quietly. "Its all destiny..." accepting my fate, i took a break from my professional study. You could have told me everything! I am sorry this misunderstanding has been very painful. You know there are two sides of a coin. So close yet never knowing each other. You never told me what happened with you. I tried to forget. And you blame me for not telling you everything. You're right. I am sorry! I met sandra on my first voyage. She was the daughter of my captain. It was just the beginning. She is beautiful. We were like needles in a clock. You know difference of breed, different purposes. Meeting at different times. I don't even know why we even got married. I didn't want sam to grow up in an atmosphere like this. Don't worry everything will be alright! There is hope. You will soon have a child. I can see it. Do you have any faith in ayurveda? I've never tried it but i have faith in you. Ayurveda means knowledge of life. It's a 5000 years old wisdom. Nature's old cures and treatments. Unfortunately, not many people practice it as it should be. I will give you some medicine which you must take regularly without fail. Have faith and put that faith into practice. Sam, come. Come, sam. Sam, don't be a bad boy! First let me finish your treatment for today. No mira. I want to play now. If you be a good boy and listen to me, i will take you to see the damn later. Really? - Really. Ok? - Okay. Good boy. Dad, come fast. I don't feel ionely right now. But... - but? After you leave, i don't know. Sam is my only worry now. Because he needs his mother soon. No one would be a better mother to sam than you. If you say yes, i don't have to go back. Am i so lucky? Our horoscopes could not have changed over night! Our stars are still jealous of us. I am sorry i am not questioning your beliefs. But what could be worse than this? Death? It's better to die than live like this. But father? I once failed with him and you. I can't fail again. Do you remember this damn? I think it is also like us. Holding pressure but for others. Do you remember those long walks to school? Yeah, in the rain. That was fun. Atleast it was fun with you. Wow! It is drizzling! Mummy! Hey! Hey, my little man! My mummy has come. Hello vinay! Hello mira! Vinay has spoken a lot about you! How are you, my boy? I am good mummy and how are you? Father... i'm... - sandra, isn't it? I knew you'd be coming. Mummy! Mummy! Where's my gift? Hi! - Where's my gift? - One second... right here. - Thank you, mummy. Thank you. - C'mon... you naughty... you'll catch a cold, it's wet. Here. Well, i've been in many more rains before. I've always wanted to be here during the monsoon seasons. Doesn't seem to be raining much right now. See, here the climate is always changing. It's beautiful here. Excuse me. No microwave radiation. Well actually, i did need to make a call. For that you've to cross the river. So, you've come to meet your son? Yes, i have. I'm also here doing a documentary on the last colonial dam. Just started my research. Perhaps i can help you. A book on navarasas. Where did you find this? I've searched so many places for a book like this. You like it then you can have it. Thank you. This no. 9... ...you know, is the most meaningful number according to vedic mathematics. Here also it's very important and for your dam project also. Here, you keep this. You see, there's a water-sharing contract with the neighbouring state... ...for 999 years and legally it cannot be cancelled. And this fight is going on and on, for decades and decades. So tomorrow, if the world war happens, surely the cause will be water. Anymore divorce papers to sign? It took me months to track you down. Why can't you at least respond to my mails? I had to find some reason to come back. Why don't you shoot a programme on diabetic children... ...who grow up without a other's care? Look, i don't want to argue, vinay. I want my sam back and you too. Why? Has your busy schedule finally all cleared up? I know what i did. I'm sorry. Where were you all these years? But i'm here now. I came back to get what i threw away. I know i was wrong. And i understand you now. Don't make the same mistake i made. Think what this divorce would do to my child. Mummy! - Baby! Mummy, see, the head is turning. - Wow! This is so cool. Did you have fun today. You look great! Don't make me repeat my words. I am sick of denying these false allegations. Stop this nonsense! Stop this nonsense. Stop this nonsense. I... i know that we need water. And i know that we're delayed. But we will get the dam. You've durai's word for it. Meeting is over. These dams, you know, are very dangerous. You know, the largest man-made disaster... ...is not the nuclear bomb, it's the dam disaster. And more than 250,000 people... they lost their lives in that. And now if this dam bursts, then 10 times more will lose theirs. Grandpa, see, octopian boy can save you from any trouble. The family doctor can't believe sam's new diagnosis. So now your insurance agent will be very happy. You must spend more time with your son. I think right now, his grandfather is a better choice. I've to go to the temple. - Temple? Sam, your father is not feeling well today. - Why? He's going to the temple. You should go back to your family. Sam needs to be with his mother. How can you take your love back just like that? Just deny everything. Our dreams, our love? Don't be cruel. Please. The stars have decided. I don't have the right to return love to anyone in my life. I'm used to it by now. Life can be cruel. Sometimes we need to burn out for others. If the flame tries to feel the pain of the wick, it can't glow. I don't have anymore dreams for myself. Just let me go back to my old life. I realise now what i was missing. I'm waiting for your nod. This is going to be my last assignment. Everything depends on you. - I need time to think. I haven't said yes yet. You said you'd think about it. That's enough for now. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 5th party at our summer palace. This is the last party we're holding at this wonderful house. Oh! - Yes... yes... our marine city will be waiting for you soon. Next year, we'll party there. - Yeah! Yes... yes... and there's one more announcement. there's going to be a new... ...cadet coming aboard the good hip freddy. Wow! Yes... yes... thank you... thank you all very much. Now let's enjoy the party. Music please. Freddy. You forgot to invite your only brother-in-law. Razia, congratulations. You know, maria will be thrilled hearing this news. If you don't mind i'll take him away for a few minutes. I didn't come here to drink or dance. What do you want, durai? They're saying, certain people have spoken to you about running for mayor. If i wanted to enter your bloody game of politics... ...i'd have done it a long time ago. And lucky for you... ...i'd rather be amongst the honest seas than... ...greedy land-hunters like yourself. But you could get ambitious. And... you've reasons, don't you? You're awaiting the next drought. You've already done enough to harm me, durai. You separated me from my only sister. Durai is not a loser. To win... ...he can separate anything from anybody. I want you to know one thing, freddy. The rule of your dynasty is over with your father. Don't try and do anything stupid to try and regain it. That's not really enough to frighten a mariner. You know, i was elected on a sympathy wave. I just might get re-elected on another sympathy wave. After the death of my beloved wife. Any doubts? Nice music going on. Enjoy the party. C'mon! Durai said he would kill maria. I'll kill that bloody bastard before he touches her again. Did i forget i had a sister and maybe she needed me? Don't jump to conclusions, freddy. First find out what you don't know. John brown was more than a mentor to me. He was my role model. Guru. Like your god. This new dam was his dream project. But he died a martyr. I'm just a caretaker. My mission is to complete his vision. Excuse me. Hello. Okay. I'll be there. Excuse me, i need to go. Can we complete this later? - It's ok. I can wait. If you need anything, just ask for it. Excuse me. Maria. - Who are you? I'm sandra, freddy's friend. Freddy! How's my freddy? Where's he? - Freddy's alright. But he's worried. - Tell him i'm alive. We know what's going on here, ok? Be ready tonight, we'll be back. Be careful. Durai's dangerous. Don't worry, leave it to us. Let's do it, rambo. Here. You'll be safe here. Let's get this mess cleaned up. We'll be right back. - Thank you. I'll take you away from here forever. Freddy, i've to tell you something. - What? Our father wasn't murdered. - What do you mean? He committed suicide. - What?! He's doing it for us. Durai! Cheat! How dare you? This must be scrapped! Do you know how many people got killed in today's police firing? I'll not let you kill my people again. We found out about you. - To hell with your findings. What?! Isn't this your signature, mr. Mayor? Your people, the same people you're speaking of protecting... ...will soon spit on you. - I... i beg you, durai. Please don't. - Tomorrow... you've till tomorrow to close this or else... ...i'll decide what to do next. Is that what you really want? Please don't do this, durai. Please, i'm begging you... - shut up. Don't do this to my father please... - shut up! I'll not let you do it. Not while i'm alive. Why are you crying for me? Try crying for your dad. The servant lied to the police. And then again in court, to make it look like a murder. Durai easily won the election. I think she left the country. - No way. Her passport is with me. Shall we go to the police? Is police more capable than durai? Comb the entire city. Track all his calls and moves. Make sure this matter doesn't leak out. Because if it does... it will jeopardize the entire election. Can i help you, durai? - No need, you  don't use that language here, durai, this is not your party office. Go search. Did you forget something at the party? I think i did. Boss. She is not here. Did you check everywhere? Yes. Move it. And, freddy, don't ever play with durai. I know. She is in the city and i will get her. Ayurveda doesn't work on medicines only. Results really depend on your lifestyle. Dad, i've some good news for you. Tell me. The inauguration date for the new dam has been fixed. I think i could show the last sunset now. When is it? - On the 9th. Another 999. Oh my god! Mira! Mira! It's a bad omen. Disaster. Tomorrow, we'll go live as planned. I'll send you a mail. Ok, bye. Let's make a move. - Alright. When do you need to go, son? Tomorrow. If you must go then go today itself. Tomorrow is not an auspicious day. Bad times, omens... ...i can't believe you're still going on and on about all his. It's my belief, my feeling. Something terrible is going to happen. Sam will go away. He must... ...atleast he should not grow up without his mother. Sam. Hey sam! Sam. Sam. - She has given up all her dreams. I have not been able to give her anything back. Sam, c'mon. Don't be a bad boy. Sam! Sam! Honey, please take your medicines. Sorry. - Sam! My documentary is going live in the evening. Please do watch it. - I'll try. Come back before dinner, it'd be our last meal together. I'll surely do my best to make it. I'm still waiting for an answer, honey. Let's be optimistic. I'll see you in the evening. Sam, you're a healthy boy now. But don't forget to take your medicines, ok? - Okay. But mira, why are you so sad? When you reach home, will you remember me? - Yes. Come with us, mira. - I can't. Please. - Sam, i can't come. Grandpa. You've put all his medicines? - Yes. Show. Grandpa, i'm a healthy boy now. You're a strong boy. Now, don't need this. So, we'll remove it. Throw it. "Salutations, o motherland!" "Salutations, o motherland!" "Salutations, o motherland!" This urban dam has completed 100 years of existence. This is the last sunset for this colonial dam. It'd witnessed an empire on which the sun never used to set. It has witnessed its decline. Tomorrow it becomes just an underwater monument. A reminder of the long gone colonial era as dam 999. Pack up. - Ok. Hey george, thanks. - Take care. Thank you, ma'am. What happened? Hope it's not the calm before the storm. Yes, looks like a heavy rain is building up. Let's go to the new dam. We need to plan for tomorrow's coverage. It's time to say goodbye. I was so ionely. I just couldn't stop thinking of you. Late. Well, i don't believe in that crap anymore. We've a chance. Vinay, it's for you. I could never take a chance with your life. My faith won't let me. I was always afraid to come to this house. For me this place has never been complete without you. You're always with me. Close to me, in my heart. I told you, it's my fate. No, our fate. I can't leave you to fate anymore. Come, let's go inside. It's going to rain now. - No grandpa, it's not raining. C'mon... c'mon... c'mon. Where's your dad? - Inside. Busy? - Yeah. Alright. - Can i have that? It's a miracle! I can't believe it. - You should thank mira for this. All i did was obey her. Thank you so much, mira. Thank you. Thank you. See this sis, passport and the cds. Welcome to the world of menace. Sir, thank you for your support. - You're welcome. Oh damn it! I'm late. And all this rain... - what do you expect? It's going to get worse. It's been burning for the past few days in the mountains. The heaviest rainfall ever been recorded. See, there's a low pressure formation moving from east towards us. What's going on? What?! Oh my god! Damn it! Stop filling the dam. - What?! You heard it. Stop filling the dam and open the bi-valve shutter. But we need special permission for that. - Then get it. Sir, what about the inauguration? Opening the shutter would flood the axis road. Inauguration? The whole place will be under water... ...and you're talking about he inauguration? We'll have to call the mayor, sir. I said get him on the line right now. I said right now. Sir, you know he won't give us permission. This dam won't take anyone's permission to collapse. There's another way out. - What? We can close the old dam's shutters partially. - No way. Water level at the dam has already reached the maximum level. If we try to pull back anymore water, that's the end. Oh my god! The altitude of this place is around 3000 feet. If it breaks, the water will rush like... ...a bullet and sweep the city in her loods. Let me talk to the mayor. Please try to understand the situation, sir. The dam is not even tested once. - What? You're scared of a little hole. Go and check out the old dam, it has a lot of them. And it has lasted more than 100 years. But this is a concrete dam, it won't sustain. We'd decided we shall not fill it to capacity right? Let's get on with the inauguration and... ...later we shall test it or fix it... whatever. Are you crazy? Don't talk like an idiot. Shut up! You got your share, right? Right? If anyone else comes to know about it... ...do i need to tell you what will happen? If the dam collapses, 2.5 million people will be washed away. Just follow my orders. Follow my orders! The inauguration is going to happen tomorrow. The press will be there, the dignitaries will be there. And so will you be. I want you there in time. Thank you. - Hello... hello... stupid. If this dam bursts, 10 times more people will lose their lives. Oh crap! The lines are down. In the present inflow rate... ...how long will it take for the dam to collapse? We've enough time to move our families to safer places. Let's go. Come. Sir. Sir, aren't you leaving? - Just get out of this place. Don't be stupid. - Let me see what i can do. Sir, we've to save this place. We've to do it. Hey man! Think about your family. No, sir. I won't go. And you, get your crew and get out of here. You can cover a big disaster. Excuse me, but what makes you so sure that this dam will burst? The way it was constructed. It's my design. I was bribed by that bloody durai. But when i realised the danger, i informed the mayor. But before he could do something, he was killed on the same day. You said there's something left to do. - What's left? This dead phone? I've a satellite phone in the van. Inform the higher authorities. Also we've up-linking facility. Let's alert the media, we still have time. But who's going to take this small leak seriously? No one. Relax. It's not too late. Let's break the rules. - Ok, come. If we can open the bypass shutter, we've a chance. Why don't you open the shutters of this new dam? But water will take a few more hours to reach the shutter level. Lets open the bypass shutter. Before we open the shutter we need to give a lood alert to the public. You leave that to me. The main power is out. You try to reach the alert. Show on the way. - C'mon! Hurry up! Hurry up! Damn it. He's acting fast. The police doesn't want the news to leak out. Let's go. We need a vehicle. - Ok. For you. We need to get out of here right now. The new dam is going to burst and it's already started leaking. What do you mean? - It'll stay for a few more hours. Anything can happen after that. You mean the whole place will be flooded? - Exactly. Everything is captured in this. We need to play this video at the local cable tv station. If maria talks, people will believe. Well let's go then, we need to reach the sea to make all this happen. But before we do that, we need to move everyone here to a safer place. The church on the hilltop is the only option right now. We've to move the patients first. How many boats do we have? - Two. A speedboat and a houseboat. Listen, razia and mira can take dad... ...sam and the other patients in the boat. Let freddy take maria into the ship. Vinay, go with freddy, reach the cable tv station. Try to convince them. Try for repeat runs. I've to get back to the dam site. You didn't give me a reply. I guess i was a little late getting here. Don't worry about me. For me there will always be another assignment waiting. Be careful. - You too. Go with razia and mira. I'll come back soon. Ok? Take care. C'mon guys, let's move. Take care of yourself and junior, alright? I've to go. It's time to go. - Ok. I'll carry you alright? - Yeah. Call, father. Mira, let's not waste time. Call him. He is still praying. The boat is waiting for us. All of you can leave now. My prayers and blessings will always be with you. He won't come, razia. He can't. He has never crossed this river. Since his wife's death. Let's pray nothing happens to him. We should go. - I am not coming. What? - I can't come leaving him here like this. Don't talk rubbish, you have to come. The man sitting inside is my father. Sam, let's go. No, i won't. Now be a good boy. Don't be stubborn, okay. And i will come and see you. Okay? - Okay. Now give me a hug. - Come, let's go. Pray for me too. Oh no! Oh crap! - Damn it! Is there any other way? - We can go through the forest. But it'll take more time. Let's do it. - Ok. Go back. I'll do as you. Ancient form. Right now you just enjoy yourselves. Yes! Greetings. Greetings. How are you? Hey! There's a leak in the dam and the dam will burst in a matter of hours. The lives of thousands are under threat. I request you to leave to high altitudes immediately. There's a leak in the dam and the dam will burst in a matter of hours. The lives of thousands are under threat. I request you to leave to high altitudes immediately. C'mon... stop it! - Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it! Who asked you to telecast this? Where is he? - He's near the exit. Where? - Upstairs. Get him. - Ok, sir. All failed. - What do you mean? This whole place is flooding. - So what? We don't have a neumatic system to open the bypass shutters. Yeah. We should go for that. But the opening valve is under water. Can we give it a try? - Yes, we should. But it's too risky. - No, sir. If we have an option, we should try. - Ok. Look here, this is the shutter drive. This is the first valve, this is the other valve. All valves are to be simultaneously opened to get sufficient pressure. Ok, sir. Take care of the shutter. At exactly five minutes, we'll open the valve. C'mon, sandra. Daddy! Where's dad and mira? Where are they? They didn't come. - What?! Father refused to come and mira... she couldn't leave without him. Oh no! We should turn all the valves. Just turn it this way. I'll show you the other one. - Ok. Oh shit! It's totally flooded. You open the first valve, i'll take care of the other. We only have 3 minutes. - Hold on. Yeah! - Yeah! Earthquake! Watch out. - Hurry. Come fast. Oh, god! Sir! Sir! Sir! An earthquake of 6.5 magnitude was recorded on the richter scale... ...causing the over-filled century old dam to burst. In just half an hour, the entire city was washed away. No more dams exist in this place. With over 4000 similar outdated dams across the world... ...potential threat to life remains unanswered. Do we stop this or should we just wait for another disaster to happen. The most terrible incident till date. Is the nature's harsh blow or human deeds. Scared of a little hole. Go and check out the old dam. It has a lot of them and it has lasted more than 100 years. Much longer than you and i will live. Can you try? Ok. I'll do my best. - Good. Charles, this is sandra. Good evening, lovely to meet you. And vinay. - Hi, vinay. And this little man is sam. Hi, sam. - Hi! Please excuse me. Vinay. - I thought i saw mira. No, vinay. Vinay, look... vinay! Stop! Please! Mira! - Vinay, please stop! Mira! Vinay! It's your imagination. I saw her. I saw her. I saw her. Alright you two, we've a wonderful... hey sam... freddy, you think we made a mistake with the ending of the story? What do you mean? I think mira's alive out there somewhere. Well, the novel's already published but there's always room for a sequel. C'mon. There's life even after death. It's in the memory. That mira lives in vinay's memories.
