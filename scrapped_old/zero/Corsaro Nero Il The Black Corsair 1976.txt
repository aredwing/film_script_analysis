 

                        The BLACK CORSAIR Is that him? Yes my count, it's him. Unfortunately, he's not alone on board. I don't see our friends, Wan Stiller. Hauls the corpses everywhere, displayed like some hunting trophies. He should arrive in Maracaibo, in 2 hours. I hope my brothers will arrive in time. - Amedeo! - Enrico! Amedeo, my brother! Loyal Wan Stiller. And your, Carmauxi. - Where is Emilio? - He hasn't arrived yet. Strange. Your brother usually arrives first. This time, he will arrive as third. His delay worries me. I saw "La Reina", the well-armed Spanish galleon set sail. If she is to encounter the "Lightning". Emilio would likely attack. "The Lightning" Turn to larboard! If Wan Ghould is heading for Maracaibo, so must I. Carmauxi! You and Wan Stiller wait here for Emilio. Then, go to Maracaibo. - Let's go! No, Enrico! Emilio told us to meet here. It is his plan. He must tell us, what's next. I'm not staying. I go! You have to stay! Amedeo, realize I'm older than you, you must obey me. But Emilio is eldest, we must obey him. So I am right. Carmauxi, which one of us is right? You, captain. Wan Stiller, who is right? You, my count. Well then, give me a coin. Let fate decide. - Head or tails? - Tails. - I heads. - Wait. I'll take heads. Then I take tails. No, I'll take tails. Will you decide? Yes, heads. Tails! How is that possible, you always win? You cheat! Lady Luck smiles upon Enrico of Ventimiglie. I heard about your new pet. Indeed, beautiful animal, Maracaibo's finest. His highness, archduke Wan Ghould. His excellency, governor of Maracaibo. Lord Ribeira de Aguanita, and Alcantar, and Mendez... ...and Lopez and Mendoza. Enough with titles. In a moment, none will matter. How dare you? Do you know who I am? Here are my credentials, given by the king of Spain. Forgive me. This makes you the viceroy. And I will exercise my power to its fullest. Lord Ribeira, you represent Spain. The largest and most powerful empire on Earth. And what have you accomplished here? Savage natives roam about... The shipping lanes are unsafe. You should clean the seas... ...from pirates that attack our ships... ...an steal our gold. This demands firm action. These bandits should be captured... ...and hung, one by one. I gave my word to the Spanish king... ...that this would be done. And it will be done. My word! I will implement it in your stead. I heard fruits are healthy. Alfonso Hernandez de la Puente Xenovia Isabella de Leon, Marquise of Bermejo. What a creature, she would sell herself, for a slice of bread. After she married the old man... ...everybody must bow before her. She's also the governor's mistress. Count Don Rafael Lopez de Alicante. - Isabella! - Yes? Funny how we share the same name. And same title - both marquises. We seem to share many things. Perhaps one too many, my dear. So true. Alas. We were waiting for you, commander. - Where are my brothers? - In Maracaibo. And Wan Ghould? In Maracaibo. Why didn't they wait for me? You know your brothers. So much shooting, over an hour now. Sounds like a skirmish between the Spanish soldiers and natives. - You call that a skirmish? - Well... It is a massacre of unarmed people. - Should we help them, commander? - No. Tonight I must settle the score with Wan Ghould. Must proceed to Maracaibo; after all,... ...it isn't prudent to leave those two hotheads, unsupervised. What are you staring at? Haven't seen mercenaries before? - What are those? - Stop joking! We are Wan Ghould's soldiers. Oooh, I'm frightened! Oh... the little girl! - Drink for courage, little girl. - No, he can't. His doctor advised against it. Leave him to me. No way, he insulted me, you heard. - But I'm older. - Doesn't matter. - Alright, heads or tails? - Tails. Heads. Unbelievable. Still haven't won a single... Okay hero, let's test your swordsmanship. First, I'll cut off your nose! Did you say nose? Stop your fun. Crew back to the ship. We set sail at dawn. Did you hear that? Wan Ghould is preparing to leave. Must be either tonight, or never. Grab your guns... ...and say your prayers. Wan Ghould must wait. We cannot abandon those who need us most, here and now. Yes, commander. - If you say pirates are everywhere, are we safe? I will defend you. Women owe much to the hierarchy, after all,... ...the council of Nice... ...have declared justly that women have souls as well. What a relief. Albeit I admit it's not a woman's soul I appreciate the most. How lucky, as my soul is the one thing... ...I refuse to share with someone. Count Amedeo di Roccabruna... ...lord of Ventimiglie and Valpenty... ...known as Green Corsair. Count Enrico di Roccabruna... lord of Ventimiglia and Valpenty... ...known as Red Corsair. Archduke Wan Ghould, I recognize you. Archduke Wan Ghould, You betrayed our parents who regarded you as friend. Robbed and murdered them, while Spain gave you immunity. Ten years we lived for one purpose - avenge our parents. We're here for this purpose. We became corsairs. And for 10 years pursued you. Finally, we found you. I cannot express myself as well as my brother... ...but If devil has a name, it is yours. And now, defend yourself, accursed murderer! You both must be mad. How do you expect to leave here, alive? Our concern was to get in, not to get out. Our fate is not as important, your Excellency... ...as the death of this man. Which first? Or both? - He is mine. - No, mine Heads. Tails! Lady luck deserted you this time, Enrico. Stabbed in the back! Arrest him! Yet another murder! You wanted death? There you have! Come on, you wretches! Pardon me, senior. Attack. There is only three of them! Three, like the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Attack! In the name of God and Spain! Amen! - Should we go after them, commander? - No. Let's search for survivors, instead. Sometimes I am ashamed of being a white man. Who are they? Each was half of my heart. They were my brothers. Yara's heart died with them. I understand your anguish. I too, have two brothers. You saved Yara's life. Her life will now join yours. Her soul abides in you. From now on, you will hear all that Yara hears. You will see... ...all that Yara sees. Same man killed my heart, as yours. Off to Maracaibo! It's an order from the governor! Have it right here, black on white. I must examine these two corsairs corpses. It does not matter what you think. They're two pirates. An entirely different off shoot of the human race. What are you? An alchemist? No, a student of science. He is the doctor of Maracaibo. I will come for their bodies in 2 hours. See you later! Who is this? Seems crazy. Nice looking Indian. Nice, but wild. Felt lonesome, so she came seeking company. What do you want? Punish you! Who is your commander? Wan Ghould's mercenaries. Lower them down... ...or I will hang you. Friends, listen to me! I swear not rest until... ...I avenge my brothers, murdered by the traitorous archduke Wan Ghould. I swear to Satan! Mighty ruler of demons. I swear! I will forfeit my soul... ...if you help me find him. Let lightning strike my ship... ...and sink us to the depths of the ocean... ...and my brother's souls haunt me forever... ...unless I find Wan Ghould and wipe out his clan as he has mine. Into the tranquil ocean's depths. My brothers... ...wherever you are... ...if you can hear me... ...send me your final farewell. Same revenge you swore,... ...swears Yara... ...for his brothers. And I too, bid them farewell. Do you hear it too? Perhaps the wind? A ship at starboard! Stand by, to hoist the sails! It is a galleon! A Spanish one! The first gift of the devil. Ready for attack! Men, get ready. Raise sails! - Cast the hooks! - At the masthead! Prepare for battle! Fire! Open the defenses! Before blood of your men stain my saber, do you wish to fight me first, captain? By rank. You next, sub commander. Help the commander! Sailors, climb up! Surrender! The ship is ours. - Wan Stiller, take care of everything. - Yes, commander. Take ten of your men... and sail the galleon to Tortuga, behind us. Search for barrels of gunpowder... and move them aboard our "Lightning". You fought gallantly and valiantly. That saved your lives. I value honest brave men. You shall have a raft and supplies, sail where you wish. Thank you. It is my duty to inform you... ...of two other passengers on board. - Who? - A countess and her chamber maid. Did you hear that? We are in the company of a famous lady! What was all this noise? Quick, disembark all gunpowder! Couldn't get any sleep last night. Forgive us, gracious lady. Among unavoidable aspects of attacking ships, is noisy ruckus. Our ship was attacked? Yes my lady, by corsairs. Oh my Lord! And who won? The corsairs. And I'm their leader. Oh my Lord! That doesn't mean I am not a gentleman. I assure you no harm will come to you nor your chambermaid. To none. May I ask your name? They call me, the Black Corsair. The Black Corsair? Did you hear that? A worse fate. Fear not my lady. He claims to be gentleman, surely he will prove it by granting us liberty. Unfortunately, I do not decide alone, rather is up to my entire crew as well. Oh my! Will any of you dare touch me... No, no, no, calm down. I promise that I will protect both of you... ...as much as my men. But your freedom will have to be purchased... ...at the slave market in Tortuga. Our pirate island. We arrive in three days. By the way, might we know your fair name? I am Honorata Villerman, duchess of Verteldrem. And this girl is my chambermaid. Ready, let's sail! That Villerman Duchess ... from Verteldrem is here. Am glad... ...you accepted my invitation, duchess. Sit down, please. Thank you. Forgive me. I asked... ...the Princess to sit here, not you. What is the meaning? But dear lady. You are the duchess... ...and she is your maid. Do you think I did not realize it right away? Forgive me, but... ...I understand you did it... ...to protect your duchess from possible harm. I will sit at your table only because I have no choice. And, what of my pretense... ...pretending to be a gentleman... ...you are no different. You are mean, duchess. If I had a gun or a sword... ...I would be even more, so. Moko... Serve the ladies. Would you like some wine? Here Your men seem to be more of a nuisance than servants. I admit that. But when attacking a ship, they're great. Evidently. Your wine glasses and dinning utensils are exquisite. From whom did you steal them? The Spanish. I'm just taking back what they took from me. Please,... ...for a moment, forget our backgrounds. You are very beautiful. I don't recall the last time I dined in such lovely company. What happened? - Is a storm brewing? - No. That is no storm. How lucky I didn't reveal your true identity. Why consider it fortunate? Your name among pirates is the most despised. Who knows what might have been had he learned you're Wan Ghould's daughter I don't think the name Wan Ghould would affect his behavior towards me. No brother, Antonio. Not quite it. Oh it is you, archduke. In my opinion, the color of her eyes is a bit faded. Don't you think? In reality my daughter's skin is more pale. A little romance might add rosiness to her cheeks. And her nose... her nose... ...to say, a bit impertinent. Understand what I mean? I understand above all, that you love her. More than anything in the world. And still I received no news about the ship taking her to Maracaibo. We must trust in God. He should trust in me! It's in His interest to be my ally! Whose sparrows are these? Olonese's. If you like them, I'll sell them to you. - How much? - You're lucky. They'll cost little... ...on the condition that you can eat them all in one night, as I once did. Who is she? Black Corsair's. Don't you know him? Which black corsair? The count? That defender of the weak? He doesn't fit among us, he prefers to play the righteousness. He doesn't even want many dealings with us. Don't touch this lady, or else. Who is this man challenging me? Spanish count from Herbe. One of oldest Castile families. His ransom was just paid, he is free. If he's paid for, I figure I could kill him now. My dear chap, you are so stupid,... I'd love to whip some sense into you, with my foil. Unfortunately, I'm disposed of my equipment. But no matter, just lend me a sword... ...and I'll give you a free lesson. Unless you're afraid of an armed man. - Give him a sword! From now on, this man is under my protection, Olonese. Try your tricks on me. Catch! Forgive me for interfering so loudly, in such tranquil Tortuga,... ...but doesn't seem appropriate for two pirates to fight amongst themselves,... ...on a night, before a major undertaking. What are you talking about? Important? - Did you not speak with the Emir? - With Emir? Who can understand him? Try yourself if you don't believe me. More languages one speaks, further one gets. So what did he say? That perhaps you are strong as a lion, but your head is empty. You conquered his sailing ship with crew,... ...but his cargo ship, sailing behind him, headed for Maracaibo... ...with treasures, you let slip away. What did she fare? He said, approximately 400 kilos of pure gold... and 500 kilos of silver. He was overthrown, and so he was fleeing to America with the national treasure. And who are you? My name is Morgan. Never heard of you. Give me time. - What land are you from? - England, Have you heard of it? And what they call you, Milton? Morgan. No one will remember that. Maybe yes. Thank you. Your hand is no doubt the hand of aristocrat. Blue blood knows its own. I can confidently lean on it. You are mistaken, my lord. My hand is ordinary like Olonese's. It became corsair's hand for the time being. I fear, it is the only kind I have... ...to offer for support. Lean on me. Free this woman, she belongs to me. I paid for her. Jean d'Avignot, as governor of Tortuga... ...acting on behalf of the French king, I need to learn more... ...about your plan to attack Maracaibo. Before giving my assent,... ...I wish to hear views of those present. Decaiuno, speak. and 500 kilos of silver,... ...I would go after the devil... ...into the fires of hell, to retrieve it. The gold,... ...or die trying, such is my view. I have two ships and 200 hands, all can be ready... in 2 days. Montbars, and you. Won't be easy, who knows how many will lose their lives. Perhaps even you Olonese. But it's an opportunity I don't wish to waste. If you die, that'll prove... I'm the bravest among all corsairs! But I will go, with all my men. - Van Horn? - I go Under the condition Olenese will allow us... ...to work out the plan together. Martin Hoffere? Why do you ask me? Though I'm an ex-priest,... ...it won't bother me to send some Spaniards back to their Maker. If He loves them as much as I love woman... ...He will thank me forever. Count from Ventimiglie. We are not going. Me nor my men. You? Are you pirate or Spaniard? You are more on their side than ours. You don't even know what you are anymore. We must conquer Maracaibo! There's lots of gold, and I want it! I am in charge, you must obey me. You must go as well. I won't go to Maracaibo with your flotilla, Olonese. Because I will be there first. I think you are mad. Our goals differ. Yours is gold. Mine is Wan Ghould. If you attack Maracaibo and Wan Ghould is not able to repel you, he will flee. I must be there first. If I remain alive when you arrive, I will join you then. You made it to Maracaibo alone, once. Tempting fate, trying for a second time? I only need to ensure the archduke won't escape alive. Even if you make it to Maracaibo, how do you expect to find him? I will find him. I made a bargain with a potent ally. Good luck. Emilio! Aim straight. And hold firm... Excellent! Moko, bring me the man waiting outside. Which one, the one playing the flute? No, the other one. You! Come here. What manners! Why do you follow me? So that you would call for me. But why? I am just beginning my pirate's career... ...and need to be hired as a captain. I'd rather have my own command,... ...but that seems unlikely at this time. What did you say your name was? Morgan. See, even you cannot remember it. I need to do something noteworthy,... ...for people to remember my name. Back to matter at hand, what do you want from me? Take me to Maracaibo. As second-in-command. Why should I? Because we have overlapping interests... ...on which I rely, as you upon your honor. Nice speech. But not enough of an incentive. Perhaps I will think of more... Wan Ghould. I managed to find his servant among the prisoners. He mentioned certain monastery the archduke frequents, alone. Offer the chap freedom, and he will take you there. And where is this man? Waiting outside. You heard me Satan... at last! Have you ever seen a ship like "Lightning", captain... uhm... Morgan. My name is Mor-gan Yes captain. They will never remember the name. Don't give up hope. What is your name? Yara. I am Jos. Why do you hate me, Yara? Who said I hate you? I see it in your eyes. I hate all Spaniards. - Did the Spanish do something horrible? - Yes. But not all Spaniards are bad. Just as not all are good. You shouldn't hate all, just those who hurt you. Why should Yara say "These I hate, those I don't" They came from the sea,... ...from Spain to kill us. Stole our land, made us slaves. They didn't ask themselves which of us are good and which are bad. If I could, I would wipe them all off the face of the Earth. But you are already making distinctions. Because you are speaking with me,... ...shows you hate me little bit less. Sometimes we just need to talk, and no longer are we Indian or Spaniard... ...just two ordinary human beings. I'm no longer anything, anymore. Nothing. How did you get here? I asked Carmauxi and Wan Stiller to hide me. Carmauxi! Wan Stiller! Come here immediately! We must say our farewell now, Carmauxi. Seems so, Wan Stiller. Don't punish them. This is my fault. I begged them so much. - Commander? - Gentlemen. Thank you. Now go. Could you believe we weren't particularly eager to answer your call? I was thinking day and night how to say "no" to your farewell... ...how to persuade you, how to resist you. The only solution I came up with, was to disobey you. I would never demand your obedience... only ask for your love. Sailors,... ...raise the big sail... ...and let's celebrate for another attack! When I lived in Italy,... ...with my brothers and family,... ...I believed honor was based simply,... ...on what one learned, adhering to rules... ...laid down by the nobility's social duties,... ...maintaining the family honor, as old as the world. Then I discovered that's not the only way to live. In Tortuga I found new life. New rules, new sense of honor. Not always better, not always worse,... ...just different. And then you came. I discovered a new life. A totally different life. Then for a moment,... ...my determination for revenge seemed to wane. If I could only erase entire past from my memory. But cannot. I made a vow I must keep. I understand. My family, my father, ...all taught me honor is all in life,... without it, we are nothing. Had I suffered what you have,... ...I too, would vow revenge. I understand perfectly. That is why I feel closer, and love you, all the more. This is why. As God is my witness, I desire to partake in your destiny forever. Regardless, to remain with you. What is the matter? You look upon me with ever greater sadness. Why? Because... I see, what will happen. And it will be very distressing. Not through my fault I hope? This is my first officer. - Captain Morgan. - I'm very pleased. Attention! All together now! Hurrah! Holy Mother of Guadalupe! I never would have thought to see Wan Ghould's daughter on this ship. How do you know she is Wan Ghould's daughter? I saw her picture once,... ...while in duke's service. At least she resembles it. But I could be mistaken. Are you daughter of Wan Ghould? If you are, don't lie. Yes. But that is no crime? It is here. Men, listen. The night we buried my brothers at sea,... I vowed to wipe out Wan Ghould's family. I even invoked Satan for help. And he answered me. In his usual diabolical style. He delivered into my hands the daughter of Wan Ghould. The only woman I could ever love. And now my heart trembles in horror. I want to annul the terrible vow. Commander, You fought 10 years against Wan Gould,... ...with us faithfully by your side. Dozens of us have been killed. Each of us lost a friend,... or even own brother or son. You taught us to hate Wan Ghould... ...with same intensity as yours. You don't decide alone. We all want to take revenge on that accursed scoundrel. Death to Wan Ghould's clan, including her daughter! - Death! - It's decided! Death! An eye for an eye! Execute her! Death! - It's decided! - Revenge! Yes, it's decided. Honorata Van Ghould, For crimes of your father, you are sentenced to death. The execution is to be carried out immediately. If you have something to say, speak now,... ...else, forever be silent. If devil is punishing you for your vow. God is punishing me for mine. Excuse me, commander. I'm here only for a short time... ...but the only one not directly involved in your vendetta. I realize you must keep your vow, but, please let me speak. Hear me brothers. I don't wish to challenge your judgment,... ...but exercising my authority as the ship's first officer... ...I invoke the laws of the sea, recognized by all sailors and flotillas. I wish to suggest, leave the execution... ...of your judgment to fate. Al right. I agree. Agreed. According to laws of the sea! And so, it will be! So, let it be! But how will you live? Lower the life raft! Behold, even the black pirate weeps. If the accursed pirates come,... ...we are ready, to receive them. Guards were doubled. Your plan was truly ingenious, archduke Wan Ghould. We let the pirate ships approach,... ...but offer little resistance. And when in reach of our cannons, then we let them have it. - Are you even listening to me? - No. I am thinking of the news a friend... ...is to bring me anytime, now. If you wish, you can receive him here, in the palace. No, in the monastery instead. Jos, where are you? Where are we supposed to go? Dominican monastery. The archduke goes there to pray every day, by himself. He has established an alliance with the priests. But I think we should split up. Why? Our number might arouse suspicion. Would be best if the two of us would go alone. In short, you take care of Wan Ghould, and... ...I'll take care of emir's gold and the silver. Leave a little for Olonese. Yara. Goodbye Yara. Wait. We will return shortly. Why are you bidding me farewell, when I'm going with you. What? The black pirate and I made the same vow. I too, must avenge my brothers. Your eyes don't seem clear today. Because I worry about you, Yara. Don't come with us. I'd rather die than break my vow. Let's go! We're wasting time. Don't stop, Jos! Which way? Perhaps here. Why don't you say what you see in my eyes?! What is the meaning of this? That I betrayed you all. I was to lure you into a trap. Wan Ghould is waiting with his soldiers. For this you pay with your life! I am ready. Kill me. Could you take me to the duke without him suspecting? Of course! But be warned! I will never betray you again. Just try, and you die. I won't. I learned to admire you. I fell in love with the people of Tortuga. All your people, especially... Basically, all your people. Can trust him now, his eyes are clear again. Perhaps luck abandoning Wan Ghould is a good sign. Praise the Lord. Repeat. Praise the Lord We lost their trail. Wait. What is this comedy of yours? Wait, you'll see. Forgive me stranger. Uh, dear foreigner... I just... Wanted... That is... I mean... ...what the hell are you doing? Maracaibo is threatened by dangerous epidemic. If you please... How did it get here? Emir's treasure brought it... It's infected. And this is the only cure. It's from the Orient. Being the only doctor here,... ...it is in people's interest that I be saved first. Please tell me what to do. Similar incident happened years ago in Damascus... and this powder... IT IS IMPERATIVE TO SPRINKLE ENTIRE EMIR'S TREASURE... ...AND ALL WHO TOUCHED IT! 'cause when they were hiding it, someone must have touched it, understand? Don't scream if you hold life dear. Move over there. I have no intention to harm you. Don't force me. Force you? On the contrary, Please don't hurt me. Put the candlestick down. A drop of hot wax on your hand, and you might not resist a scream. And you please put aside your sword. What if I were to sneeze? Alright, but promise you won't scream. Agreed. Even if you might not believe my word, I assure you I have no intention of dying. I truly won't scream. That's better. Do you intend to stay long? Until he comes. I surmise you are very secretive, and enchanting. But I know very well who you are. You are whom they call the Black Corsair. And you wish to confront Wan Ghould? On his account I sold my soul. I tore out my heart,... ...at a time it beat the strongest, for my beloved. May the Lord have mercy on me. I saw the archduke kill your brothers. It was a cowardly murder. He killed them treacherously. I know a lot of people, very important people... ...but nobody like Wan Ghould. He is obsessed, as if consumed by unquenchable fire. I came to extinguish it, once and for all. - What is happening? - I am returning from my watch. I saw sails on the horizon. They are pirates'! At last! Give marquise a message, not to wait for me tonight. Then come to the fortress, we'll be there. - Yes, sir - Very well. First night I spent looking a man in his eyes. Might be a nice story to tell my grandchildren if I ever have some. But they would never believe me. The archduke? No! The archduke would knock more discretely. I have a message for the marquise from archduke. - Captain! - What Manolo? Moments ago I thought... ...I heard voices and footsteps,... ...in the marquise's room. We must investigate. My lady? Yes, Manolo? Captain Mannere has a message from archduke. I'm not feeling well. I have a headache Go away all of you and leave me alone. Your servants seem very obedient. Much too much I would say. Shame to have to kill some. What? Have any idea how much each one costs these days? Could you please escape in a less expensive manner? I would need your help. You have it. To start, embrace me. Gladly. I must admit I wanted to, all along. Don't shoot, he'll kill me! Allow him to pass. Prepare a coach! Quickly, the coach! Put down the guns for goodness' sake! One shot will kill me! It's the black corsair! Don't shoot! Let him escape, for her sake. It didn't move... ...all night long. It is a ploy! Feigning an attack from the sea. The real battlefield will be the fortress. That is where we wait for them. We give the order, then attack from behind. Let's go. I wish to inspect the fortress walls. If someday I will have grandchildren... I will tell them of tonight and you. Better go. The sun is rising. That is the hour when fairytales end. Archduke and his officers keep inspecting the fortress. Shall we go? Yes. After so many years, so many deaths, we finally meet face to face. Perhaps your sword is faster than mine, but surely is not faster than Shutz. He is with me and is going to show you now. Perhaps you are a honorable man,... ...but your archduke sent you to certain death, this time. They attacked! Mannere, back into the fortress! Ready all your men to fight! - Follow me! - Archduke is retreating! I will stop him! These are your final moments, mercenary Stop them! The men are ready, Olonese. Half a ton of gold waits for us on the other side of these walls. Let's take it! Attack! Let's kill the dogs! More than half our men will be killed... ...before they reach the walls. Who said so? Remember, the tiger is a successful animal because he is ruthless. I sent Hoffer to take care of something. Walk! Walk! And here he is. Why do you need all these friars? To pray for you? No, Spaniards won't dare shoot at them. Order your brothers to take the ladders... ...and raise them against the walls. Never. May the Lord have mercy on you. Carry the ladders or I'll boil you alive! Quickly! Carry the ladders! Forward! Forward! Hold your fire! Those are our Dominicans! Don't spout nonsense, captain. Open fire! Order your men to fire! Be brave! Reinforcements are due any time. Quickly, the pirates are surrounding the fort! Get ready, quickly! That's the black corsair. Come with me! Kill the dogs! Climb up! Shoot them! Where are those reinforcements? Hold it! This one is mine! No, he belongs to the archduke! Retreat, it's all lost here. To the boats! We must reach our galleon. Fight the dogs! Maracaibo is ours! Kill them! Kill them! This man's will to survive is strong. In a few days, he will be healthier than either one of us. Waiting for my recovery to execute me? Don't worry, if possible we will kill you sooner. We're waiting for archduke Wan Ghould. You're aboard his ship. May we go now doctor? In my opinion you have bad luck. Would be better for you to die sooner. Remember me? Aren't you the count of Laerma? Yes. And I was a prisoner of pirates long enough... ...never to forget to loathe them. Don't doubt I won't get even. You will spare me from agonizing death by hanging, I thank you. I did not forget I owe you for saving my life. You saved me,... unfortunately. Unfortunately? I have maybe a year to live, at best. Blood disease, they say. A sickness which afflicts aristocracy when it becomes old and tired. A sickness that is the sum of all my life's choices. New blood must replace the old. Who knows,... ...perhaps even pirate's? And you, count of Ventimiglia, known as black corsair, what blood have you? Corsair's, or count's? Perhaps only the blood of a man,... ...searching for truth. The difference between justice and injustice. Not that obvious. Pablo! Pedro! Your escape won't be comfortable... I hope you can adapt, count of Ventimiglia. I realize... ...you cannot offer me an entire ship. Correct. Will a barrel suffice? Next time we meet, I'll return the favor. No, this makes us even. I'm Spaniard, therefore your enemy. If we do meet, it will be in battle. I hope you win. Rather lose my blood quickly in battle, than drop by drop. May I say I have profound respect for you, sir. And I for you. We escaped in time. Maracaibo just fell. We are glad to see you alive. I am pleased to inform you we have a prisoner you deem highly valuable. The Black Corsair. Then it is true. Where is he? In the gallows tied up. Take me to him! I want to see him right away. You two, leave the barrel, and come with me, instead. Move!. Idiots! You captured a man I've been hunting for 10 years, all over the seas,... ...an enemy of the Spanish throne. And what did you do? You let him escape! Find him! Search everywhere! He may still be on board! These lazy Spaniards dozing at their posts! Letting him escape right under their noses! If you cannot find him on board,... ...lower the rafts and all after him! But the ship will be defenseless. What means more to you? Don't you understand the black pirate is worth 100 galleons? We'll see if the Black Corsair will be as dangerous, once hanged. Lower all rafts! Can you see him? No. Row! Head for shore! See him now? No, not yet. We must catch him before he makes it to land. We were following the archduke, and by chance found you. A raft from the "Lightning" will be waiting for us in the lagoon, quickly. - There he is! See him? - After him, hurry! Follow me. They are escaping! - There, they are! - Shoot! Won't you rather tell us where the gold is? I don't know. I don't know anything. The mercenaries hid it, ask Wan Ghould! - What are they shouting? - Morgan. - What is that? - Famous name. - No name is more famous than mine. - Look! Who would have thought Morgan would seize... ...emir's treasure with handful of dust? I bet he will become the most famous pirate in all of Tortuga. Hope he remains on our side. I would hate to have him for enemy. Hey you, who might you be? I am Jean Davidnol, L'Olonese! Olonese? Never heard the name! I'm joining him, bye Olonese. Me too. Bye. I should remind him to return to the "Lightning". The commander will need us. Do you hear anything? Nothing. Strange, I thought I heard something. Don't move, be calm. Let him be. If you're not his enemy, neither is he yours. They were ours Did you find them Finding anyone in this jungle isn't easy. Now what? Let's go the other way. Now that one, he was his enemy. See? The "Lightning" is waiting for us. My beautiful ship! It's me, my count! Wan Stiller! My trustworthy Wan Stiller! Yara! Jos! All on board! The raft is ready. That is why I was waiting here. You don't have a sword. Take mine. A dagger is enough for me. They discovered us, quickly! Commander! Fire! Excellent, Carmauxi. They were too far away for your knife, so you used a canon. That may be a good time. Still thinking of her? If my heart would beat, would do so, for Honorata. What is that? That is Wan Ghould's galleon. What is Morgan doing? Why doesn't he move? They are still out of cannons' reach. Why doesn't she head for open sea? Perhaps he's afraid to lose you. But risks to lose my ship! Sail to open sea! Away from shore! Morgan must have gone mad. Hes making human targets of them by sending them to the bow. Captain, fire another round. Fire! Carmauxi! My Lord, why aren't I dead instead. See, he moved. Complete massacre! Raise all sails! The rudder is blown to bits! My ship is lost! Their ship is crippled. Shall we go after her? No, she is unimportant. Just blow her up. Count, look! The current is floating the bodies towards the galleon. We won't even be allowed to give them a proper funeral. Soon we will join their fate. We cannot go back, soldiers are waiting on shore. I rather go to my death fighting. Perhaps I might die aboard their ship. Forward! Row! More gun powder! They don't have firearms. Use swords. Stop! I know your brave men... ...could easily defeat the wretches,.. ...but likely, by killing them. While I... ...would rather hang the black pirate alive. We are with you, commander! You pretended to be drowned! - Was Morgan's idea. - How genius! I told you count of Ventimiglia we shall meet again in battle. Please don't force me to kill you. Hope you will. It's my last chance to die in battle. - I owe you for my life. - We are even. Don't belittle me. Fight! After me, nobody! Into the sea! Yara knows the question... ...which denies your heart peace. Because now,... ...so close to death, Yara understands many things. You too, saw what I saw? Why did they restrain my hand? They only... did... what your... heart desired. Once, in you... love entered,... ...hatred departed. I think, we are close to the 7th parallel. That is the Gulf Stream. The same place we abandoned Honorata to fate. The same currents that will carry us to death. How ironic and diligent is fate. Let it carry you... and you will see,... ...what Yara now sees. what... Yara now sees. Commander, come see who made it back! I see you are alive and well, as ought be. Seems we share similar fortune. - It seems so. - Maybe the devil fears us. So he doesn't want us. Just as he didn't want you, he doesn't want our "Lightning". Here, he is not. These are fresh footsteps, leading to the beach... They took the small raft. Couldn't have gone far. Though can't see them. Why did they leave? - I think they saw the "Lightning". - Another reason to wait! Or to go. His ship "Lightning", represents a way of life... to him, which now is ended... even though is still ours, my friends. The small raft is carrying them towards a different life, a new life.
