If you are the Anderson Silva finish. - Have you seen this before? - No. - How many fights have just narrated together? - Just over a thousand. And I've never seen anything like it. That's why people criticize Anderson. From what it does now. Circulates around doing nothing. If you're Anderson Silva must be thinking: "Okay, I tried what I wanted. Let's finish this fight. " Damien Maia has And 50 seconds... Time Time I'll tell it again. If you keep running well, will lose points. Stop doing that. Next time will be 1 point less. I'm warning you. The last seconds of the decision. And they separate. The judges' decision is unanimous... and world champion the UFC middleweight... is still Anderson "Spider" Silva. Can you explain your actions tonight? People who have paid thousand dollars for entry... think made their money worth it? EMPRESRlO OF ANDERSON What do you think? I think I never felt so ashamed... PRESlDENTE THE UFC In 10-years in the business. It was the first time I left a big event... and handed the belt to fighter's manager... and asked him to put it. You are in a difficult situation. Do not like what he did. He disrespected you, the sport and the fans. You give some kind to punish him? I can only say that his next opponent... do not let him this sort of thing. Chael Sonnen will face it and I hope this does not recur. IN THE ABRlL 14, 2010 The UFC 117 Fol ANUNClADO ANDERSON HAVING SlLVA and Chael Sonnen HOW TO ATTRACT PRlNClPAL Chael Sonnen is with me now. I talked to Uncle Dana, I begged him. "Hold this cancer for more than 3 months and I'll get rid of him. " - And it will get him out of MMA? - He was. Will sign the withdrawal on August 7. BY THE TIME PRlMElRA, ANDERSON CHANGED YOUR BASE TRElNO BRASlL FOR THE U.S. TO PREPARE FOR A RECORD OF DEFENCE 7th TITLE EX-CHAMPION LIGHTWEIGH TRElNADOR MUAY THAL TRElNADOR OF JLU-JlTSU Not finished yet. Let's train more. Is that OK?" We do not see Nick Barbot be controlled so long ago. He is picking up. It has never been dominated like that... or when he fought Anderson Silva. The three judges gave 30-27... declaring the winner unanimously... Chael Sonnen! GOOD TO GREAT-VINDO LAS VEGAS, NEVADA Anderson Silva is very good in submissions. How will you respond? He got a black belt with the Nogueira brothers. For me, a black belt with the Nogueira brothers... 118. is the same as earning a toy with your lunch. I don't know. I do not understand what is it too. A is a punching bag and the other is irrelevant. You said on Twitter that Ed Smith was supposed to care... his "wild bunch of dwarfs." was referring to the Black House as a fight club... or what he meant? I say this for some time. Anderson Silva speaks English... it just does not talk to the fans. He speaks in Portuguese and English. When you hear an opponent as Chael speak this way... he is more motivated listen or not? I pity the Chael. He does this to sell the fight... and I understand why, but at the end of the day... he will fight the best in the world, it can only talk about it. He says the same others have said... but the changes in crop the octagon. I've had enough. He is a fraud. He enters the ring and wants to do reverence. He did not come from that culture. If you do this in Brazil, go hit your head... bring your wallet and quit laughing at his face. This guy is a fraud! Bye, darling. I love you. I love you too. I disagree. He will enter this fight with Chael... and we'll discuss the way it to 90 pounds. I agree 100%. I think he will knock Chael. He can knock out, it is possible. Chael will be in his face... bound to fall. I'm enjoying this fight with Chael Sonnen. ESCRITRIO OF NIKE PORTLAND, OREGON LANCE ARMSTRONG CENTER The GAIOLA, FIELD RONALDO If you have bad-blood on our side? It's a good question. Do not know what Mudblood means then it is difficult to answer. But he's not my type. Anderson Silva is a champion... who dresses and behaves as a member of a gang... - nobody will disagree with this - he wears earrings, hat, sweatpants and pink shirt. is what gangsters use. Move your foot. Ahead. I work hard... and believe in giving a good example for the next generation. There are many people watching me and that's exactly what they should do. Four stars and mortgage. You can cry at will. He does not need to go, do not need. He can hit the mat. And I think he will. And you think you have what it takes to bring it down? You said that on 5 hits will be the middleweight champion. In five attempts. So he up the leg... I'll give him a headbutt and throw it on the rope... and put it in his place. Anderson Silva was upset with the bullshit of Damien Maia... but you're taking it to another level. Do you think that is affecting his mind? Who cares? Who cares about his mind? Anderson is already history. If not for me... Anderson Silva would be in the unemployment line... sending resumes the Internet now. Ed Smith, his manager, said that no one listens to you... unless you speak Anderson Silva. Interessante, took a taxi with him two weeks ago... - It's a lie. - And revealed my philosophy... the pre-Shakespearean. And Ed said: "Wow, we were teleported to the 15th century? " I said. "No, Ed We are still in the taxi... and still did not invent it. You're kind of stupid. " Thank you for your time. - This guy is nuts. I do not know what it is teletransportation Then I discovered I had to do with "Star Trek." This guy... Seriously, he has mental problems. We thank every opportunity... Chael IN PRO MMA RADIO - And when it does not work... remember Lance Armstrong. Lance Armstrong faltered, he used drugs. If delivered to cancer. Instead of saying: "I flinched, do not do it or may have cancer "... he became a victim and earned absurdities... campaign with a victim. You see these guys and know they are frauds. It is a scam after another. From Michael Phelps be a stoner... up having to deal with these things. And I'm happy to be in this business... because I can catch them in the Octagon and give them a beating... 25 minutes. He said that all catch, Mike Tyson got up. "Anderson just not picked up yet... because the guys are afraid the headlines of it... and video highlights. " He said. "I am not a teacher mathematics from Ohio... 215. like Rich Franklin... Canadian'm not a fighter a leg like Patrick Cote. I'm a gangster Portland, Oregon. And the story will change on August 7. " That's good. OK. - You get it? Let's get well. - We're running. Lets go You're interviewing someone who has had his battles with Anderson. It's a strange situation, because I bet on him... since entering the UFC, but also blasted the media for... because he "collaborated" so to speak. I really think he is the most talented fighter in the world. Boxing, kick boxing, muay thai, MMA, pinochles... appoint any fighting style, he is the best in the world... when there is 100%, mentally. It's the kind of thing that makes Dana White crazy. I sat there put up with so far. So I got up, went to Ed, handed him the belt... and asked him to put it. I would not put. And walked away. Never done that before. Anderson and I talked... and we see the result on August 7. Anderson This is the man! The last fight of the Dandan... he will face the guy again. Dandan overthrew in one minute and a half of fighting... and will now fight again with him in Portland. PORTLAND, OREGON More here. Hence, Smile. Is that OK?" right? - Come. "Great! Sorry. - There you go. "thanks Mr. Jordan." Thank you." Okay, I'm Kim. "Hi, "Hi, - Do you smoke? - No. Masca-smoking? - No. - Alcoholic beverages? - No. After three rounds of fighting... the three judges scored Your winner, the "Irish Warrior" Jake Valdez! Did you see that guy? Where is he? Where is he now? Go get fucked! Chael Sonnen. It will take a beating. Of good. Anderson Silva is an imbecile. Chael Sonnen will finish him. Ending it. I'm from Portland, Oregon. Got it? Chael Sonnen to the end face. Chael Sonnen to the end. Come on, Bubs. Hello, thanks for participating this conference today. My question to Anderson is: Anderson, Chael made it clear... his intention in this fight. With this, this is the fight over expected for you... in his career in the UFC? No. That's it? Yes No. OK. I started training with Steven Seagal. Penny when asked the question... knew the answer would be boring... then what? - Thanks for the interview, Chael. Don't mention it. There goes Anderson Silva again. He believes that the response which gave just now. Which people are going to see the fight and nothing else. He was serious. Think you're being... more but could not be more wrong. He does not understand business? Never done anything in life? Is not that what people going to see. People do not just want see two people fighting. Want to know why are struggling. He does not understand the business. It's amazing he finds it will stay there chested... while people hit him in the back, saying: "Good job, Anderson. You have trained a lot. " Guess what, asshole? Training since 9 years... and still awake people's interest... to see me bang you on August 7. Man, we're in the business of fighting. We need to sell fights. I understand that he did not want to talk, but need to sell the fight. But now... What I'll talk to him? Countdown 10 days for fighting. What's done is done. He will not change. He is well and until he... He does not understand the concept selling the fight... or he understands and prefers not to participate. I can not say for sure. Now Dana White is calling me. Hello! All right... Him.. What the fuck, man. He said Anderson is losing the fight... he will want to cut it. "Let him learn to be good. Let's get rid of it. " Who wants to hear such a thing now? Do you nderstand? I will say one thing... this is a documentary of it, his movie is... and do not want to speak ill of him... but if he comes to "Abu Dhabi Anderson"... will not be good. It will not be good. This is the game. Hi, I'm a big fan. - Hello, nice. - Amber. Do you have Twitter? Do you have Twitter? I... Is. Yes. What's your Twitter? you know. What did you say? I asked if they know what is your Twitter. - Ah, my name? Why? - Because I want to talk to you. See here? That's how Twitter works. FLIGHTS - GATES - Hey, man? - How are you, cousin? It is a picture of you in LA. A beautiful photo. If Anderson ever been to punching someone... - this is the guy. - Is. That 'will be fun. He said he does not come a culture of respects. What if I do this in Brazil, go hit your head... and take your wallet. Worse it's true. That was good. What's up, dude? - How are you, boss? - Well. I liked the beard. And that, folks? It's good to see him. Very good! - Hazrmsnz? Yes. I think we started shortly. As always, I'll start outright. is the first time we're here and we are happy. I love being in new markets. If you've done it before, long ago... since we had a collective press so full... and the reason is the anticipation. Anderson, everyone has heard it all that Chael Sonnen has said. How do you feel about it, and how he prepared for this fight? He said that "talking about me is easy, I try to be. " Chael, repent of something you said? No, I do not apologize. Moreover, the interpretation Smith's is wrong. Anderson said: "It is easy to talk about me, I try to be." He said: "It is easy to talk to me trying to beat me. " You are not the only one here Portuguese-speaking... despite acting like one. It is easier to understand the language to understand the Latin. He said he likes pink and his wife too. I do not know if he likes, but I like it. So it was a coincidence? He said no, is not a coincidence. He wore because his wife said that would look good next to him. That 'began as a history of MMA... but it became a story the national sport... and I know that yesterday denied have talked about Lance Armstrong... just wondered if it was criticized... to have been associated to comments. No, of course not. Nobody criticizes my comments. Just get compliments. Actually, I applied for public office... and received 99.6% of the votes. It was his opponent? "Exactly. Just to know. Front. You may sign one more? Thanks, guys. Thank you." ROOM TREINO FIGHTERS ONLY - NO VISITANTES If the weight is wrong, is your fault, not the balance. So please, guys.

Hitting the champion. We went pro early the third round. - Chael pushes him again. - And they go back to the ground. Dude, look at that. He is holding the weight of Chael Sonnen... is picking up, is frustrated and is grounded. The song of Sonnen. Now in the center of the octagon. One of Silva's left. Anderson kicks. And he drops the elbow. Here comes Anderson Silva! Chael secure it, but can not control it. Anderson kicks his body again! Pro floor! Chael is on top. Inverso. We are reaching the fifth round. Another round pro Chael Sonnen punctuation. I'd give it 4-0. Do not think of anything else, only in the hands and move forward. They're standing.
