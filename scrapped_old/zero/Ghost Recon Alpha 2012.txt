Out of the truck, Dimitri. Come on! - Who's he? - He's my cousin, Lev. Why haven't you mentioned him before? Let's see what you have in the back. You stay... in the truck. Hands still. - Move on, Dimitri. - Alright. - Relax. - Keep moving. Open it. Come on, Dimitri. Come on! Don't shoot! Who are you guys? - What's he saying? - He wants to know who we are. We're fucking salesmen. Better keep moving. - I'm done. You didnt tell me. - Listen, sweetie. Either you get behind the wheel, or I do. If you do, maybe you'll get your truck back. - Get it? - Got it. Good man. Let's move it! bTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Alpha/b - Sir. - Bring it in, boys. The military base was decommissioned last year, but Sokolov is still the CEO. They're in two sets of blocking positions. Here and here. Okay... That's our "Boy". Wait a minute. There were three SUV's. Advance party is clearing.

Sick'em boy. Okay. Talk to me! - You got eyes on Sokolov? - Check. - Chevchenko? - Negative. What the hell is that? I don't know what the hell they're doing. Where is he? - He's coming. - Coming? Tangiers worked out very well for us. Everyone thinks it was the government. No one trusts anyone anymore. My assets are in place, I need the package. - He's coming. - Is he coming or not? - Yes! That's it. The deal is off! You understand? Take it back. Wait! The city has already been chosen. You have ten minutes before we clean the entire area. - Get what I want. - I always do. - On target. - Holding... holding. Chuck? What you got? Positive on Chevchenko. Fuck it! No shot. Show me my money. You can buy an army, general. I already have an army. Open it. - Shit! - Oh, man! Cut "Scout's" mic! Cut it now! Something's down there. I've got acoustic interference, there's something jamming the whole signal source. It's as strong as hell whatever it is. Let "Scout" take a peek. Here we go. Holy shit. We've got a "Bulava" war-head. Six heads, We got a loose fuckin' nuke. Okay, let's get it on. We have a deal. Traitor! Get the car! We got them both. We're out of here! Stay put. Neutralize the area, we've gotta get to that weapon. Two in the SUV. Your call. Shit. All right. We've gonna secure that nuke. - Chuck, can you neutralize that fuckin' thing? - We're gonna find out. Moving in. Hey, you! Drop your weapon. Pepper, keep an eye on the North gate. Shit! - You ever done this before? - Sure. Of course that was an American nuke, and it was a simulator. Get together! On your knees! Who else? Who else didn't come out? There's something out there. Get back! Holy shit! What the fuck is that? We get this thing away from the nuke. - Chuck... - Yes... and this is the honeypot! The PU-239! - What? - That's one. Five more to go. I got nine, ten... inbound. Cloaked and loaded. They got flankers! - Stay on that weapon. Pepper, cover him. - Roger that. Shit! This thing is slow, once it clocks you, head south. - Four to go! - Hey, Boss! This thing ain't so slow! Reloading! - 30K! Get that thing to the canal! - I'm trying! Where the fuck are you, Chief? God damn it! Where are you? - How much longer? God damn it! - Two left.
