I found out who The Snake is. Larry? What's wrong? Larry? Hello? Larry? Larry? Read all about it! Snake bite murder! "The Guardian"! Snake bite murder! All the news. Read "The Guardian". Good morning, Mr Harras. - Good morning. Here you are, all the news, the snake bite murder! Read all about it! Read "The Guardian"! Special report by Jos! Special report... - Wouldn't dream of reading a rubbish like that. You're missing something, man. "The Guardian"! Snake kills man. Mr Fielding is already awaiting you! Good morning, sweet thing. - Mr Fielding is waiting. I know. Yes? A wonderfully good morning, Sir. Do you mind? Mr Harras, what do you think of this article about the snake? It is distressing to me to see you read that writing. Jos is a scandalmonger. You could learn from that scandalmonger. "The Guardian" shot down the price bird. The evening edition is selling like hot cakes. What do we have got to offer? How about printing a composition of mine on the theme that love life exists... on the moon. A marvelous sensation! - That no one would be interested in! No, my dear Mr Harras. The mans love life temporarily takes place on earth. Whenever it happens. - Very well, Sir. And furthermore I might add that my patience is wearing thin. Just you pay me a fixed salary or you increase my regular rates, and I let you have articles, I guarantee you, every bit is as good as Jos'. Now, don't go up in the air, Sir. Remember you answer. Do you mind? You ought to take a bit of meat now and then. You wouldn't be quite so nervous. The finger prints correspond perfectly. - And the photographs? Identical, Sir! That will do, thank you. Lights. - Yes, Sir. Larry Graeme, born June 10th, 1920 in London. 5'6" tall, hair dark, eyes grey. Speciality: jewellery. Previous convictions: 7. Prison sentence: 4 years, released on Monday. - I know that. Go ahead. Imprisonment follows information received from the Snake by Scotland Yard. were due to the same source. We can be very proud of that. Listen to me carefully, I have got an idea. Larry found out who The Snake is. He was trying to get him, was caught, bumped off. How does that sound? - Sounds fine. It has one great advantage. Before this, The Snake had always left the messy work to others. And when they asked for a greater share of the lolly, or if they got to big for their boots, he rubbed them out. In that case, it is the first time, he has been forced to do his own work. Yes, but don't forget, Lomm. Every criminal makes at least one mistake. Yes, what is it? Let's have it. - The analysis is ready, Sir. Go on, then. - Go on. It's a case of poisoning. Very effective. Echidnotoxin, Sir. Very, very good. All that I wanted. That is the kind of snake. Judging from the space between the puncture, I'd say a mamba. You know, some are green. - Excuse me if I interrupt you. This morning we had a call from the Mulford Breeders. A black mamba vanished. What? - Yeah. That's important. Make a phone call and say that I'm coming. By the way, the press waits outside. - Say "No comment". Hello Mr Elford. Well, how did you get in here? - Through the door. Very funny. Are you looking for material for another detective novel, Mistress? Yes, I am. Do you think you know who the killer is yet? Can you keep mum? - Cross my heart. So can I. Goodbye. - Very funny. I won't forget. Pardon me, I wonder if you are... - Ask the young lady. Goodbye. Harras. - From "The Telegraph"? So, you know me? Then we are colleagues. I have never seen you. A new girl? I might well be. - I was a beginner once too. No shame! If I can give you any help, please don't be afraid to tell me. What actually did the inspector tell you? Can you keep mum? - Like a sphinx. So can I. Good day. Weiber! You're expected, Sir. Please do go in. Good day to you, Inspector. Sorry. - Mr Mulford? No, I am the manager. My name is Sutton. Mr Mulford passed away. Want you sit down, please? Come Suzie, get out of here. Come on. You have been here long enough. I have to work. Do you want a drink? No, thanks. Do you mind if I smoke? - Not at all, please do. A light. You wanted to see me about the missing mamba? Yes, Mr Sutton. We have some solid grounds for assuming that a man had come into contact with the mamba, and the evidence indicates the bite... of your mamba caused the man's death. - I have read the story, Inspector. But you must align to what I'm saying, it is completely senseless. Please explain, Mr Sutton. - Some snakes can adapt to cold weather, but this one needs warmth. In the rawness of a climate common to us, it wouldn't through a night. - I see. How long would a man live if we suppose that a mamba sank its fangs... right into his neck? - That depends upon the physical... constitution of the man. Not very long. - Do you mind having a peep... at the room where all your animals are? - But of course, certainly. Miss Trent, please come in. Take the inspector down to Brownie. He's our keeper and will show you around. Excuse me. I have a lot to do. - Certainly. You have been very kind. Good day. - Good day, Inspector. They say "Don't look around you if you go or you'll find yourself back in again." I hope not. - Mr Leslie? Yes? - I have come for you. Mrs Mulford is expecting you. Please. Auntie, that was splendid. - I really do believe... I had a particularly good day. - I also share that opinion. Very well done, Nancy. Particularly the Tempi... in... in the finale. - Yes, that's right. It was extraordinary. It was extraordinary. - Thank you. Hearing your approval is so good. A Mr Leslie of Dartmoor wants to speak you, Mrs Mulford. I beg to be allowed to say... - James, whenever you have anything... to say there's a worm in it. So you'd rather say nothing and show him in. As you wish, Ma'am. Step this way, please. Welcome, Mr Leslie. You can leave that case you are carrying into James' keeping. Yes? - Yes. Don't be afraid if he's not. - I am Mrs Mulford. Your case was recommended by the clergyman of Dartmoor. I do feel it's my duty to help people like you. Did you say help? - Yes. I'd better tell you then: There's no remnant of evil in me anymore. Finished! - Very good. Very good. You see, that's the right attitude for an... Ex-convict? The right word will be following me forever. I'm sure, it won't. Trust in me. This is my manager. He is willing... to give us the helping hand by taking you on as an extra assistant, aren't you? Yes, Leslie. I'm ready to take you under my wing. We'll find a way. That's something that you two can discuss later on. So Sir Fielding and I... have several things to talk about. I hope that you will be content here. And I'm so very happy that there is no longer any trace of evil in you. Come along, Leslie. Beryl? - I'm coming. Beryl, my dear. It's a hard blow which you dealt us when you didn't... allow us to print your new thriller in serial form. it's quite a book! Sorry, I find you much too conservative. I saw your fees! Goodbye, Auntie. - Goodbye. What a lovely couple. You can be very proud of them. Absolutely, yes. When I see my dear nice Beryl... I simply think of days long ago. My poor dear Paul. it's actually really quite a little while. But you still are, Nancy. I don't think you've changed very much at all. What's the matter now? - I got whisky in. James, you are really beginning to show signs of age. You have given us the wrong cups. I'm terribly sorry, Madam. - Never mind. You can go now. I want to understand that, Nancy, every time we had tee together... you never drunk anything but whisky? - Oh Lord, bless my soul, no. Thank God for that. - Once in a while, it was rum. That's much more complicated than it looks. All animals are sensitive. And beast of prey are still harder to keep in hand. Still I prefer animals to human beings. Well, I hope you'll be happy here. Don't give him too much, Krishna. This is where we crate the animals. You work here to start with. Brownie? - Yes, Mr Sutton? This is your new assistant, Leslie. Good morning. Hello. You're now on your own. I hope you show Mrs Mulford is right to trust you. Yes, I hope so, too. Miss Trent? Miss Trent? Hello? Yes, I found the safe. Excelsior 10/62. I have taken a pattern of the lock. Yes. As soon as the key is ready, you'll have to get me shifted the night-duty. All right, shock him harder, Kid. Right in the guts. Take him harder. Go on, keep going. Another one. Right, left, right, left, right. Come on there, Kid. Hello, Inspector, do you want a sparring with me? Are you ok? - I wasn't ready for that one. Right, left, right, left. - Hello, Champ. Shut up. - Hey, hello. A little mistake. What do you want, Inspector. Do you want to train with us? No, I don't need it. I think, I'm in rather good form today. Champ, I want to ask you a question. I don't like the sound of that at all. Enough for the day, Kid. Come in my office, will you? What is Scotland Yard doing here? Get out! Whisky? - No, thank you, I had breakfast. Up to you. - Larry Graeme is dead. What about it? Graeme used to be a boxer. - Really? He never boxed here. It's a shame. What's a shame? - Oh, he was a good man. As a boxer. Otherwise not? - That's just a matter of opinion. Well, I suppose, that's all. Thanks for the help. Oh, by the way... that's really an awful photo of him. Next time you're down in my neighbourhood, I'll show you a better one. The first round really went to me, what? Just a second. The Champ wants you. - What's up? Listen. Elford of Scotland Yard has just been here. That's bad. What did he want? All right. In that case it jumps on for tomorrow morning. At 10:30. Dad? What is it, Dad? What's wrong with you? Dad? Help! Help! What's going on? - My father had a heart attack. He'll have to get to a hospital. Please call an ambulance. Please, can I make a phone call? I have to get an ambulance. A man has... - Yes, there's a telephone back there. Thank you. I hope he's all right. Yes, he seems to be coming around. The ambulance is on the way? Here it comes now. An excellent organisation. Has your father had this many times? - Yes, especially in the last year. All right. Lend a hand here, son, will you? Move on there, please. Move on, keep moving, there. Be careful with him! Wait! Wait! Here you are! Your father's hat. Thank you, Sir. Mr Harras! What on earth are you doing? - I am playing Ping-Pong. The Ping-Pong, I invented without a net or table or partner. It's excellent for the reflexes. You ought to practice more. - I understand. You mean the column by Jos about the jewel robbery. That's press stuff, sensation mandering. I'd like to say this: If the day comes, when I'm one of the salaried writers, you may count on "The Telegraph" having it's finger right on the world's pulse. - I haven't preserved this. For sale: inexpensive garden furniture. A few white chairs, several red flower pots, and a lawnmower. Now offers under 30-10-4/3. The offer was to be sent in writing. Money should be posted with the orders, but there where no orders. And then they were happy. - Exactly. White means: diamonds and then red rubies. And lawns are emeralds. Yes, and the figure is a secret code. The underworld changes every other day. What this means is the loot from the jewel robbery has been put on the market. The question is only by who. - If the Lord hadn't quit the business once and for all, we'd had a go for him. This is just his kind of job. Anyway, one thing we can be sure of. Tonight's the night. I bet the stones... will be changing the ownership. Probably, they land in the clutches of The Snake. He the first one in line every time, on these occasions. Are you interested in some inexpensive garden furniture? And they're all perfect stones. This is the end of you, Snake. Blasted mist! I want you to take a look at these men. And if you feel, you can identify any of them, tell me. Go closer, you'll be quite all right. Yes. Yes. And he, too. But where are the other two? I don't see the boy. And his father's not here. - His father won't make any trouble again. Lights! - The rest of you can go home. Goodbye. Move over there, come on. Well, Gentlemen. So our little prayer went off well, didn't it? Someone outside to speak to you. - I haven't any time, now. It's the son of that man Lord. - Why didn't you say that? Give him in. Am I going to get my property back, Inspector? That's the one. He's the son. - Yes, yes. One thing at the time, please. So, I hear you, Lord's boy. All right, come on. My father told me that, if anything went wrong, to give you this bag. Would you kindly take a look at this? Here they are, Inspector. Here they are! - That's good. Will you check them? Let's see if there are not missing a few. Take a seat. All right, sit down. There. What do they call you? You father put a name on you, when you where born? Jimmy Graeme. - Are you connected with Larry Graeme? Yes, he was my uncle... my father's brother. Oh, I've got it now. Lord wanted to get The Snake... for his brother's death. - Yes. You were to have this and guess, my father was killed. Here is something odd. The same paper and the machine that makes that high "I'm interested. Thursday, half an hour before midnight, White Chapel. The car dump just off Silverstreet." The Snake, all right? Wait outside, will you, for a moment? I should be needing you again, Jimmy. Ok. What have you got to say'? Don't lie to me and don't make up any fairy tales. We've pulled off the job exactly the way the local rags have described it. This business had to look real. Or The Snake would have smelled a rat. You know, that chap is clever. - Everything is here, Inspector. This doesn't happen every day. - Then it's all right. Can we go now, Chief? - Go where? I hope, you're not serious! All of you sit down. And not in a bunch. Just sit down and hope you'll find a magistrate who will give you a break. We didn't want to nick all of this stuff. - You'd better give us an account... of what you did, not what you intended. That's what we are paid for to find out. How do you find your protg getting along, Frank? Good, but he didn't turn up to work today. - Naturally, he didn't. Why do you say "naturally"? - Did I say "naturally"? Really? I meant, he may have caught a cold. Just you try spending 2 years in prison. Then your resistance to colds may not be so unshakeable. My dear Nancy. With what will you delight us today? I thought of Beethoven's Fifth. Ah, the Fifth, how lovely! Inspector Elford of Scotland Yard, Madam. Show him in, James. How do you do? Forgive my intruding. I have to ask Mr Sutton a few important questions. Oh dear. - Mr Sutton shall we talk here, or... I'm sure Mrs Mulford will not mind if we'll remain here. Wouldn't it be much nicer, if we sat down? We will be more comfortable. Please, Inspector. - Thank you. Mr Sutton... Inspector, won't you please be seated? My aunt really meant her imputation. Thank you. Mr Sutton, would you mind telling, when you last saw Thomas Leslie? When did I see him last'? That was... - I mean alive! You mean to say Leslie is dead? An hour ago at Mulford Quay, one of your packing crates was accidentally smashed. Into that crate, someone had packed a python and a dead body. Thomas Leslie. I was hoping, you could explain what Leslie was doing in that packing crate? What sort of a question is that, Inspector? If I could tell you that, I had also known who murdered him. - Did you say "murdered", Mr Sutton? I didn't say anything. I was trying to... - Just a moment. I've got a question, too. Is this an official inquiry or what? - I must first know what function you are. I'm a friend of this lad. - I'm afraid, that won't do. In point of fact, we have every reason to suppose that my colleague, Sergeant Leslie... was murdered. You really mean that you have sent one of your men into this lady's house? That's outrageous! - You'll pardon me, Sir. Our methods... I complain to your superiors! - As you wish. I have good influence on the government. - Very useful, Sir. Mr Sutton, one more question and that's all. Is it reasonable to suppose that the python... that attacked Sergeant Leslie, crushed him and caused his death? No. Normally speaking no. A large snake like a python will compress it's prey, until it's ready to eat it. I must add... - Thank you, that's all. That's all, I need for now, Mr Sutton. Please forgive me again the intrusion. Goodbye. Sir, I'm happy to have met you. Goodbye. Mr Sutton is not here, Madam. - I know. That's why I came. Can I rely on you, Brownie? - But of course you can, Mrs Mulford. There is every likelihood, that an inquiry will take place here. An inquiry? - Yes. Scotland Yard is convinced, that someone among us murdered Mr Leslie. - But, Mrs Mulford. Whatever anyone may ask you, remember: I don't want any scandalous reflections on my husband, Brownie. His name is never to come into it. - Depend on me for that, Mrs Mulford. Thank you, Brownie. You're a good man. And of course, you haven't seen me. Good day. This time, I'll take things into my hands. And nobody is going to anticipate us. No, Sir. Nobody. - Take this please. "The riddle of the death on Mulford Quay." That's much better. That's perfect, Sir. - Continue. One of the finest young officers of Scotland Yard was found... dead in a packing crate this morning. - All in capitals. A giant python... curled around it's poor victim and crushed young Leslie to death. What? - No, I complement you, Sir. Thank you. What are you reading there, Harras? Give it here. "The Guardian!" - What? There's a mistake somewhere. This little rag! "The riddle of the death on Mulford Quay". "Report by Jos." "A report by Jos. One of the finest young officers of Scotland Yard... was found dead this morning..." Just one day I'll... That's hardly worth it, obviously. I suspected that my 5th husband, the Duke O'Candy, had one single hobby: murder! And when I saw the open grave in the cellar I realised... that the next victim would be myself. Yes, me... the only person whose evidences could take him to the gallows. Oh, it's exciting, Beryl. What's in the next chapter? - Revealing that would spoil it. What will you title it? Did you decide? "The Red Killer" - "The Red Killer", enchanting! At least tell me one thing. How does your red killer gets hunted down? I'm not sure yet. Very likely, I'll shoot him. What? You bump him off? No, that's too good for the this creature. I'm sure, I have a better idea. My plan for him is to saw him into little pieces... Aunt Nancy! Who is that in the middle of the night? - I'm sure that it's your red killer. Auntie, you can't open the door. No. - Who will then? James is asleep, and I see you are anxious to do so. Please don't go. Call Frank. How nervous the young ones are these days. It's curious. Yes, yes, yes... I'm coming. What was that? Who fired that shot? - Shot? You really are nervous, my dear. - But I'm sure, I heard it. The wind snatched the door out of my hand. I found this under the door. Read it for me. Frank! "24 more hours, Sutton, and then you will die. S.'' Another cheerful "I would look for you", is it, Mr Sutton? Do you think that maybe all this is just an unpleasant joke? It's unlikely this would be a joke. It's quite certain: The Snake took your mamba. You couldn't be positive of it. - And how do you say that? That's my secret, Mr Sutton. But what's bothering me now is the question of your security. How are we going to protect you? - You think that's really necessary? Yes. Would you please let us know every time... you decide to go anywhere? I mean to or from your office or your home. Naturally. We will be watching you from now on. As the saying has it: watching every move you make. That will be all for the time being. Many thanks for your visit, and please not a single word to anybody that you have been here. Is that clear? - It's perfectly clear, Inspector. Goodbye and thank you. Goodbye, Mr Sutton. Now, what's up? Here is Mr Green with some curious information on Leslie's death. Tell me. I hope you to help us. By the way, Mr Green, pathologists always have the last word. Agree? In this case, yes. You see, if you wish to be exact we should say Leslie died 3 times. A bit to many, what? - Yes. First through a fracture of the spinal column, then through a snake bite, lastly through a compound fracture of the skull, Inspector. But 5 or 6 hours before, rigor mortis had already set in. Do you mind explaining how a man dies of a snake bite, when there's no snake present? By forcing the poison through the epidermis and thereby into the blood. By forcing it, you said? With pressure? - Yes. Is that what you mean? Yes, that could be it. Yes. And the only one who kept calm was Frank. I mean Mr Sutton. Yes, men seem to like playing the hero. - Maybe. But he still thinks this whole... thing is nothing but a ridiculous joke. - But he did go... to Scotland Yard, Miss Stedman... That's Mr Sutton. Miss Stedman is here, Mr Sutton. - Thank you. Well, Beryl. What a surprise. Please, come in here. To what do I owe the honour of your visit? - I have appointed myself your guardian. Oh! - Yes. I want to keep an eye on you. I'm afraid, you come a bit late. Inspector Elford has taken the job. And I tell you, he is taking the business seriously. I even had to promise... that I would keep secret the fact that I have been to his office. I can tell you, though. - And Miss Trent? She mustn't be told, of course. - Oh? But you have told her about it. She told me that you where there. - What? Yes. Just a minute, please. Did you want to see me? - No. No. Well, I'd like to find out how you learned that I've been to Scotland Yard? From Miss Stedman. What? But, Miss Trent, you told me about that now. - I? You must be making an error. How could I have known about it? - Frank, I assure you... It's all right, Beryl. Just stay calm. You must believe I wasn't lying! - I'm sure of that. But the story is somehow getting eerie. I'm not sure now whom I can trust. Me, Frank. - Of course, that's not what I meant. Perhaps it's that I'm overworked. Besides, a certain Mr Harras just has been here... Josua Harras? - Yes. He's all right. He's a reporter for Sir Francis. Well, you have chosen a bad moment to do a story on this place. We are all sold out. - Do you expect to get in a new stock? Certainly. A ship is ready now in Nairobi. That lion is going to leave us today. And this tiger. The one in the cage here. He's been here the longest. Nice. Puss, puss, pussy! - We were asked to put together... a mixed group for an animal trainer's circus act. Mr Harras? I merely offered him a bar of chocolate. Inspector, I'll be leaving the office in 5 minutes. Yes, thank you. You know, if all goes well, I may have a big surprise for you. I expect to fly to Nairobi within 2 days to get some animals. Is that all? That's not very surprising. - Here. We go out this way. Beryl? Wouldn't it surprise you to know I booked places for both of us? Are you taking me with you? - Yes. I want to, and Aunt Nancy agrees. Oh, Frank! I'm frightfully happy. Mr Sutton, may I speak to you? - How did you get in that state? A slight mishap at work. What do you think of The Snake threatening you, Mr Sutton? It is Aunt Nancy's proverbial discretion. - And the inborn sense of tact... of Sir Francis. We should have known that. Mr Harras, really, I'm very busy. I have just one more question. - Tomorrow, Mr Harras. Mr Sutton! Tomorrow could... be to late. Thank you kindly. I know that The Snake is the most dangerous man in London. But what makes you so positive that this dangerous Snake is a man, Sir? They just delivered your tickets. Sir, look there. I've got him. Let go of me, will you? Mr Harras! - I almost got him, Inspector. Got whom, Mr Harras? - The Snake. A mental blank! What is that thing for? - I am a member of the press. Wonderful. All nine. By the way, how late is it? I believe my watch is slow. You know, Frank, when you're worried, they all go slow, don't they? It is stress to be unable to act and just waiting... to be done in. - I'm not worried. Beryl? - Yes? Please, get away from there. I do believe, he's coming. Can't you hear? - No. Then I made a mistake again. Let's play another one. I'm sure, we'll be through this soon. - No, dear. If I were The Snake, do you know, what I would do? I would... That's him. That's him, I'm sure of it. It's getting late, Madam. Good night. - Good night, Frank. Make sure that you shut your door. Because one can never be sure what ideas might enter The Snake's mind. Good night. - Sleep well. Mr Sutton? All in order, Sir? Yes. Thank you. Good night. Good night. This is the chance of my lifetime. It will be on your conscience if my career ends. Just let me free and I promise you... - Oh no, remain right here. Inspector, no, look. Don't say another word. - I won't this. And I won't give you a light either. - Never mind. Here. Sir, there's something happening upstairs in Mr Sutton's room. Come along. Hello. It looks as if you have settled the case yourself. We have nothing more to do at present. Lomm! Take fingerprints. That's not gonna be easy. James! - Sir? Clear away the snake, will you? - No, no. I'm afraid, we have to confiscate the murder weapon. I'm sorry. Of course, Inspector. Here you are. Well, take it. Come on, Constable. I wouldn't put your helmet on, Constable. You never now. What happened here? - I was studying the score of Parsifal and a bumping noise began in the house. - Don't worry, Mrs Mulford. Everything is under control, isn't it? Yes, it is, Inspector. I hope so. Once one has got the cops in one's house, one can't be quite certain. What are all these bulls doing here? - But Auntie! What? I learned those phrases from a book of yours. Aren't they correct? Don't worry about them. They are dead right. That's it. I wish you good night, and I hope you sleep well. Good night, Inspector. - Bye-bye, Boss. Bye-bye. ' Bye-bye. Mr Harras! Mr Harras? What's going on? Headline: "I have come to grips with The Snake!" Special report by Josua Harras! Brilliant. Well done. I have always said that you had in you the stuff... of a great reporter! We won't be done out of this by Jos of THE GUARDIAN this time. Absolutely not, Sir. - To prove that I appreciate your work, as of today, you're definitely engaged. - Thank you, Sir. You won't regret this. Hello? Fielding. What? Who says that? You mean... This is quite ridiculous! What about the freedom of the press? No, you can't do this to me, oh no! Right. It's a bargain. What is it, Sir? Whoever was that? - Scotland Yard. We won't be printing your snake report. You're fired, Harras. Thank you, Sir. Brownie? Ask Krishna to come in, please. - He's not here, Mr Sutton. Why not? Where is he? - He hasn't been here the whole day. That doesn't surprise me. Call in Brownie. - Will you come in, Brownie? Now, may I ask what all this fuss and bother is about? You certainly may. We have evidence, that Krishna is The Snake. Krishna? - Well, or he's his right hand. I just can't believe it. - As Hamlet said there are more things... In any case it was Krishna, who slipped that mamba in your bed, last night. What? - Yes. We even have a witness. Mr Sutton? - Brownie, I have a question... Just a moment. Hello, Brownie. - Sir? The Blueman Rusk Glassworks Company has delivered special frosted glass windows about a week ago, right? - That's right, Sir. Oh, thank you. For what reason where those windows ordered? You see, Sir, it was my night off, and Leslie was on duty. Krishna told me that a char woman dropped her bucket and... Can you recall on what date that was? - Yes, I can. It happened on March 20th, the day of my wife's... - Thank you, Brownie. That'll do. Well, Mr Sutton, what do you say'? Does that give you any ideas? No. - Leslie was murdered on March 20th! We found splinters of frosted glass embedded his scalp! My late husband first called him Krishna, I think. He had come here as a keeper... with a ship of animals and somehow just remained with us. Thank you, James. You may go, I'll take care of it. Were you satisfied with Krishna? - Yes, we were. Absolutely. Are you waiting for someone, Mrs Mulford? - No. It's just an oddity of mine. You see, I lost my husband under very tragic circumstances, Inspector. Do you want sugar? - No, thank you. Forgive me, Mrs Mulford, if I open any old wounds up, but you said you have lost... your husband under tragic circumstances? - Yes, he committed suicide. My husband had aided his brother to leave the country for Australia without knowing that he was involved in some criminal activity. Then some weird creatures learned of this and resorted blackmail. My husband was finally forced to take the only way out. Have you been able to learn the criminals identity? No. But you may be sure that I shall go on hoping for the day to come... when this criminal is brought to justice. Yes. Let's hope so. Don't take any notice. Old women often get rather garrulous. What am I being sitting on? - Can I help you? You were sitting on this, of course. - Ah, it's "The Red Killer". The red what? - You must read this. A new thriller by my niece. It's really splendid. This is the first chapter, and Beryl has already managed 8 death. What have you found? - Rather amusing. Is this really your niece's work? - Yes. I'd very much like to borrow the manuscript for a few hours. It'll be better if I don't... - I won't give the game away. Promise me that. Or I'll tell you how it ends. The gardener is the murderer. Well, Inspector. Rest absolutely assured, The Snake's letter and the manuscript... were typed on one and the same machine. - That must be an error. This is unbelievable. - Unbelievable or not, I'm certain. But besides the matter of the raised "E" there are 17 other characteristics... that support my proposition. Look here. If these are really... May I complete my analysis, Sir? I'm sure the manuscript and paper... you gave me to verify were taped by two completely different persons. What did you say'? - The person who typed the manuscript... was a touch-typist. The strokes are extremely light. Each stroke was hard, hammered down. Something like the hunt- and pick-system used by police constables. I beg you pardon. Why did you have to tell Miss Stedman what I told you? It just slipped out, I'm sorry. - It was a mistake. Don't you have something else to say'? - I? No, why? The plane tickets for Miss Stedman and you were not delivered yesterday... to the villa. They were brought here. - What? Oh, yes. I forgot to mention it to you. We're flying to Nairobi. I mean... It wasn't my idea. It was her aunt's decision. You know how she is. - I know how she is. If you know that, leave me in peace. I'm worried about other things. You don't love her? - No. You're lying. Come now, Millie. You know that whatever I do is for both of us. No, it's only for you. It's 6 years now that my life has been a mockery. Even this job as your secretary is... - I didn't force you to do that. No, but it was the one way, I could possibly get to see you. Come now. I'm doing all this for you. - You give me money, I can buy everything, I want to. Only, I cannot buy one thing, what I want most. Love. Millie... - I'm warning you, Frank. I'm warning you. Don't forget about The Snake. You might find a choice next week. What did you say'? - Leave me alone. Millie! Darling. I promise you that I shall fly alone. And when I return, we'll begin afresh. Really? - I swear it. I love you, Millie. Darling. I got to go now. I'll be back in a minute. Wait downstairs for me. The mamba you gave me to examine was incapable of using it's fangs. Because both of them had been pulled out. - When, Green? Don't sit and look. - Come on then! I should say round about 2 days ago. My counts seem quite certain. The telex from Calcutta has just come in. This is a stroke of luck. Look here. We'd better... Yes, thank you. You'll better get me 2 cars. You wouldn't have alight, would you? Thank you. Hello, is anyone here? Yes, Miss Stedman? - Hello, Miss Trent. I was supposed to meet Mr Sutton. Do you know if he has left? Yes. - When will he be in again? He'll take a plane tomorrow morning. - Did he take our plane-tickets... along with him? - You won't go on that plane. Won't I? - No! I trust this is a joke! We mustn't begin another scene, Miss Trent. I find... the entire business absurd! - So do I. You'll not go on that plane. Had you been drinking? - I have not been drinking. I'm thoroughly fed up with all the play-acting. Millie. Darling. I promise you that I shall fly alone, and when I return... we'll begin afresh. - Really? I swear it. I love you. Frank Sutton and I are married. For 6 years, if it's any of your affairs. He's married to me and he's going to stay married to me. To me! Yes, yes. That's her car. Will you wait, Stanley? Hello, Miss Stedman. Good day. Do you often walk by yourself this way? - Do please leave me. I'm in a great hurry. - The car is quicker. That's my concern. - Naturally. May I ask you something? Will you be on the plane with Mr Sutton tomorrow?.........- No! So you won't be on it? - No! How upset Mr Sutton will be. - I never want to hear his name again! Now, isn't that a pretty hard thing to say'? He has been married all the while. - Yes, I've heard. Miss Millie Trent. Actually their marriage took place in Calcutta in the year 1957. You knew all the time! - Yes, I did, and a few other things. Excuse me for a moment. Hello, Stanley. Let things start rolling now, please. Yes, Sir. What about Mrs Mulford? - That's ok. Has Lomm come yet? - No, Sir. Not yet. No matter. Let's crack on. And now we two will take a little ride... in your sports car out to your house. - Would you tell me... I will, but later. Do you mind? What are you doing? You... So you are The Snake! Help! Come here, Frank. Have tea with me. Beryl won't take long getting here. Thank you. I expect they're still out shopping, getting ready for their trip. Oh, you'll excuse my nervous statement. I have many things to do... before our departure. - Will you take sugar? No, thank you. - Oh! Well, you did not... You better just not stir. Will you tell me what's happening? - Later. Later. What's new? ls anything happening? - The tea has just been served. Come, please. You know Mr Harras, I believe. I was the cause... he was loosing a coup lately. That gives him the right to be here. Many thanks, Sir. And: fabulous hunting. A glass of Cognac, Frank? - I don't know. What is all this? - Oh, there is nothing better... than a good cup of tea. Don't you think so? I don't mean to be rude, Mrs Mulford, but the tea seams rather queer. Well, Frank. What's important is: You've managed to drink it. Whether it tastes a little queer or not... is less important. I feel so hot! - Aren't you well? No. - Wonderful. The inspector was right! This stuff works phenomenally! And now he can't move an inch, our poor Mr Sutton. Are you out of your senses? - Please don't worry. In an hour Sutton will be fit. What do you want from me? Frankie... You are a swine. So this is the trouble, some little gun, huh? A pistol with which all of your poor victims are murdered. And wasn't tonight the night you came to kill me with it, and poor James... would find me in the morning while clever Mr Sutton... would have flown by then and he could never be caught! How does this thing work? Like this? Like this? And like this? No. No. - Yes. Not an easy death, the poison of the black mamba. No. No... Wait. Don't! I tell you what you want. Only... not that! In that case tell me who you are, Mr Sutton. I know, of course, but I want to hear it from you. I count up to 3. Yes... I'm... I'm... The Snake. Shall we go in, Inspector? - No. Let the old lady have the moment... she's been waiting for. We have plenty of time. "Mr Paul Mulford! Better send me the money that we have agreed upon... or I shall see to it that your actions are known...", and so on and so on. You in fact are the writer of that letter. Yes. You are therefore guilty of blackmailing my husband! You pursued a man... you knew was innocent to the point where he was driven... to take his own life. - Yes. Inspector. I have finished. She's ready now. Oh! I was on the point of forgetting. Have a light. Amusing. So convenient. Thank you. - Please keep it. I think you need it. Oh, well isn't that... - Bribery. Absolutely. Hello? Yes, Lomm. What's up? What? Ah! Aha... By heaven's sake! No, no. Here it's all over. Thank you. Millie Trent is dead. Murdered. She was in his way. I'd better tell you this. We found a few more details... about Mr Sutton's affairs. He had 20.000 pounds, put aside. Pretty good, what? It won't do him much good now, will it? Yep. So that's the end of the story, Miss Stedman. That's all. No happy ending, but we can't help this. Anyway, if you should ever need any good ideas for a book call me, won't you? Right. You played your hand, Snake. Ah! I suppose you'll know what you're in for? The gallows. And far as your poor simple friend Krishna is concerned, the one you used and misused for your criminal activities, he'll be under doctor's care! Forever! Just a second, please! Don't move! Hold it! Thank you! Sir, this will be my kind of story. How I knew it? On time as usual! Oh... On time as usual. What have you got to tell me, Inspector? - Well, just one thing. You've lost the scoop once more. By the way, do you know... Mr Jos! - What? You are Jos'? I am, indeed! Josua Harras. Jos! - You're indeed! Yes, Sir. Since yesterday I'm "The Guardian's" chief reporter. Harras, I'll let you have what you want! I'll double your salary, I'll take you on for life. I'll construct a Ping-Pong-room for you, an entire sports-stadium! Harras! Madam! Paul, Darling... Please forgive me. I had to do what I did. I do hope you will be pleased with me. Yes, Nancy. It was worthy of Edgar Wallace.
