ReaIIy? What about me? You are okay. There are ghosts here. Are you kidding? It's true. Have you read the news? Swimmers often drowned to death in this pooI. Maybe I heard about it. This is the pIace. Was that a Iong time ago? Not sure. But this pooI... is haunted. Why did you want to meet me here? Don't you Iike it? WeII, it is quiet. We don't have money for moteIs. It's impossibIe at home. This is the ideaI pIace. Are you scared? No. What happened? I don't want to kiss- It hurts my Iips. You wont contract any disease from kissing. A handjob is fine too. I didn't know you Iiked this. What? This. Do your parents know you're gay? What about yours? Maybe, but I no Ionger Iive with them. I don't Iive on their money. I work at the garage. My mom knew it for a whiIe. You toId her? No. She went up to my room, and found porn movies. A horny brat you are! What happened next? Did yourfamiIy cause those bruises on yourface? No. Friends at schooI hit me. My famiIy doesn't hit me in the face. Do you know what I hate the most? I hate when they cry. It's Iike they are neverwrong and it's aIways my fauIt. Let's swim. The pooI is dirty. I wiII show you something. Let's go to the deep end. Not sure if ourfeet can touch the floor. Why shouId we go there? You'II see. Why that dumb face? What're you doing? You got water in my mouth! Whenever I feeI bad, I do this, breathe out, and go down into the water. Watch me. Try it! When you see the sky through the water, it's Iike the whoIe worId is yours. You don't need to care about anyone. Try it. You have to breathe out aII the air. Don't be scared. Breathe it aII out Iike when you're dead. Let's do it together. Hey! Who's in there? Let's get the key. Don't break the door. Who's in there? Open it! - He's there! - Get him down! Don't run! You said you wouId return the money you owed today. I'II give it back to you when I have money. You say this everytime! Search his bag! Don't you have anything!? PIease give me back my ceIIphone. - How much can we get from this? - You shouId keep it. - Leave him here. - Don't give a shit about him. - If I ever see you again you are doomed! - Remember! What happened to you? You didn't pay what you owed them, right? - My aIIowance is not enough. - Kids from otherfamiIies never compIain. Do you have a fever? Who's that man? Who is it? That photo in your computer. Your brother showed it to me. Afriend. Why do you Iie to me again? He's reaIIy my friend. Can't you change? Did I raise you badIy? You know yourfather hates this. Why? Don't you have any pity on me? Morn, pIease don't cry. I won't do that again. I Iove you. I don't want to see you cry. PIease don't cry. How do you know I Iive here? I foIIowed you. Such a bugger. Hurry, or my mom wiII see you. - Do you have to be that quick? - Come on. You are such a nag! You shouId go downstairs to open the doorfor me. Why do I have to cIimb to you? You can go ahead. Never! I'II faII! - You can try. - No! Then foIIow me. Be carefuI. Shit! Are you scared? No. I'm not used to this. It's nice up here. Why is your room on the rooftop? My dad wanted to use my oId room, so I had to move up here. You know what... They never beIieve in me. A Buddha image was Iost, and my brothertoId my mom that I stoIe it. My dad's money was missing, and they accused me ofbeing the thief. Then who took it? The money orthe Buddha image? Both. I didn't take the money, but I stoIe the Buddha image. Shit! I needed money, and to them, I am aIways wrong. So? I wanted to take revenge on my father, so I soId what he treasured. You're such a brat. Can I Iay my head on your Iap? Sorry. You know what? We are gay, and our parents can't accept us torwhat we are. PeopIe aIways say... we shouId be good to them and work hard to provide them with money. Make them know we can make them proud. If I am gay and unsuccessfuI in Iife, everyone wiII see me as an asshoIe. It's so unfair. Can I sIeep in your room tonight? No. My morn wiII see you. So what? I couIdn't care Iess. I don't dare to. Then foIIow me. Where are you going to take me? You'II see. Get off first. Where are you going? FoIIow me. What are you doing? Just heIp me. Have to hide the bike. What for? It's dangerous here. Be carefuI. I'm not sure ifthey are around. Who? WaIk carefuIIy. There's Iots ofbroken gIass. Why did you take me here? This Iand used to be my famiIy's, but they seized it from us. How come? PowerfuI peopIe here cIaimed it's their Iand. Why did it become a garbage dump? There was nothing, but one day they came here and started trading garbage. Later it became a garbage dump Iike this. I wanna pee. Wait here. - I'II go with you. - Don't. Just stay here, or I can't pee. Don't be scared. I wiII take you out anotherway. I saw something among the garbage. What did you see? I saw... a corpse... Those peopIe might use this pIace to dump bodies of peopIe they kiIIed. I'm sorry that I took you here. That's okay. I just want you to know that if we can get rid ofthem, this Iand wiII be ours. Then you and me can Iive here together. What wiII you do it you get this Iand back? I wiII burn the garbage. Burn them aII! Turn it aII to massive fire, that Iasts for many months. Orwe can seII it, and get a Iot of money. We can spend it forthe rest of our Iives. For me, I'II seII some parts, and turn some into a rentaI flat. Are there any factories around? I don't know. Or I can rent out the Iand. We'II think about it Iater. Are you scared? No. See you. Tam. Where did you go? Why didn't you caII me? I hung out with a friend. IS ii that guy? Did you see him? So you spent your night with him? Just take care of yourseIf. I'm worried about you. Yes, mom. But now, don't bring him here often. I'II taIk with yourfatherfirst. Why didn't you answer? I was sIeeping. Morn caIIed you many times. Why didn't you go downstairs? I am tired. Go see her now.

A month Iater, they found his body in the washroom. I saw when they took his body away. It decayed and stunk. PoIice say he had been dead for many weeks, but no one found him. How's that possibIe? Spirits may hide him. They wiII hide peopIe they want to take. You wiII neverfind someone they hide, untiI that person dies. Why do you bring me here? I think I shouId be fine. You're such a dick. Are you afraid? No. Then Iet's go to the washroom. No. What are you afraid of? We've fucked in there. If you don't go now, you wiII be a coward forever. Goddamn it! That's my brother. Who did this?
