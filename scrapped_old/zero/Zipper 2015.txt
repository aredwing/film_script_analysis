 

                        1 Federal prosecutor Sam Ellis is widely expected to run for higher office. - With a "not guilty" verdict. - But a resolution is expected shortly on federal charges. That Ellis plans to seek higher office... For Ellis, everything is riding on today's decision. Today's decision will either launch - his political career... - ...Presumably beginning with a run for Attorney General. Mr. Ellis? Yeah. A couple of us arranged this little drinks thing at blend. We're kind of all assuming that You'll be there. Don't we have to win first? There's no way You'll lose. All rise. Do you think sheriff Haussler should be given a lesser sentence given his record of public service? As I said at the trial, Jim, this is a black-and-white issue legally and morally. There should be no special treatment. After today's victory, do you intend to pursue corruption charges against other officials - in the mayor's administration? - No decisions on any further action have been made at this time. Any chance you're gonna run for Attorney General, Sam? Well, I have my hands full at the U.S. attorney's office right now. While Haussler is expected to appeal today's decision, all eyes will be on whether the U.S. attorney's office plans to seek charges against mayor Jonas Stiegel. So, straight on to Attorney General? I can neither confirm nor deny, counselor. Fucking liar. You didn't hear mommy say that. How's his temperature? Mm. Almost there. We were watching you on TV. Yeah? Did I look nervous? I felt like I was shaking. You looked hot. Women on the jury really loved your lady justice thing. Uh-huh. It's you they liked. Well, they did throw their undergarments at me. - Is that unusual? - Whores. My dad was watching with George Hiller. They think we should get Nigel Coaker to write you up in his "faces to watch" piece. Yeah, that'd be amazing. I have Nigel's number. I'll give him a call. He owes my dad a ton of favors, anyway. What time are you coming home? Uh, you know, they're having a little victory lap party for us. I got to put in an appearance. Lame. I'm kidding. It's fine. Proud of you, honey. Okay, I'm pulling up. I love you. Love you. To Sam Ellis. After 18 months of nonstop toil, may he enjoy his moment in the sun, 'cause tomorrow, I'm going to bury him under a pile of work. To Sam. To Sam. Do you guys not get it out of your systems freshman year? - Fuck off. - Fuck off. Okay. Jeannie must be excited, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. She's getting restless, though. Don't tell me you're not, either. You've done all you can here, especially with that fucking fossil running the show. - Easy. - All right. It's, uh... It's time, yeah? Sam Ellis for attorney fucking general. Everybody was just waiting for you to win this fucker. Put a pin in it for now. No, no. Don't leave me hanging here. There's got to be more to life than hedge funds, or I'm gonna fucking kill myself. Come on. I do have to go, though. Before the wife throws a fit. Come on. Listen, congrats again. - Yeah. - Yeah. - See ya. - See ya. I'll take another. You did not! No, I don't believe you. I'm not saying that. You did a great job. And what exactly are you saying, counselor? I am saying that you should just move around a bit before the semester's over. You don't want to go back to law school thinking that this whole office is just one boring section. What If I like your section? I still think It's a mistake. I do. You got to figure out what you believe in, what makes your righteous. Angry, even. And you have this figured out? Absolutely. Guys that I take down have no reason to break the law, yet they're these over-privileged, morally bankrupt individuals who think they can just stomp on the weak and the powerless and get away with it because they usually do. Mm. If I didn't think they deserved to go down, couldn't try the case. Don't quote me on that. These cigarettes go to my head. You're a lightweight. Yeah, I don't... I don't smoke. Just doing it to impress me? Oh, I gave up trying to impress girls like you a long time ago. Oh, boy. Yeah, this, uh... Can't do precisely that. All right. I'm sorry. - Yeah. - You're married. Oh. You know, I can keep a secret, though. I'm sure you can. I just can't be one of them. Goodnight, kiddo. I love you, Ellis. Love you, too. If you want to move on this, you better be staying here long enough to see it through, 'cause I'm not getting burned on it. Guy's committed actual crimes. If human frailty's all we got, it'll look like a moral crusade. Then let it go. It's not my job to help you chase headlines. Do you want the mayor out of office or not? Yeah. Hey, how much longer is Dalia with us? Eight weeks. Any chance we could transfer her? I'm not telling the ninth circuit judge I fired his daughter 'cause she's too damn pretty. Right. Sam. This is Ellie green. Miss green, this is Sam Ellis, - chief of our criminal division. - Sam Ellis. - Hello. - Hi. And you've already met U.S. attorney kirkland. I wanted Sam to review your file. He's tried a lot of these identity-theft cases. Knows how to work a jury on these kind of issues. Hmm. The right man for the job, then. So, what's the concern? Would you prefer to explain? I have a record as an escort. How'd you, uh... How'd you get into that? Was trying to model, and, um, I was working as a waitress at a hotel. I met this guy who suggested I could make a lot more money just going on a few dates for an agency. He was right. That how you met the defendant? No. Elite encounters only serviced very high-end clients. Politicians, prominent businessmen. I, uh, saved the lowlifes for my personal life. Would you say that your experience makes you an expert in lying? No. No, It's... It's not about that. It's about fulfilling people's fantasies while minimizing their guilt. I'd say being a lawyer is probably better training for lying. But you do have a criminal record. Not for lying. Would you tell your parents about it? It's not like I was a street Walker. You think the jury would perceive that distinction? The men will. - Wow. - Hmm. Yeah. I know I should really push the parent issue. The jury might get past it. If they see her as an abandoned kid up there. Maybe. Everyone's got a dark side you don't normally get to see. I think jurors understand that. I know a lot of guys who used her agency. Swore by it. Shouldn't we be prosecuting that? Trafficking, sure, but we got bigger problems. You said it yourself, Sam. Nobody cares about human frailty. It's still against the law. Right. Boy scout. Say "hi" to the intern for me. Night, chief. Have a great weekend. Take it easy. Oh... No. James asked If he could have a sibling. Really? Yeah. That Stiegel? Uh, no, I'm just helping Noah with a case. You think a jury would discredit testimony from an escort? I don't know. Depends on the witness, I guess. You don't think they'd find it morally reprehensible? I think they probably understand It's not quite the taboo it used to be. I mean, you got all those people watching Internet porn. What's she like? You meet her? Is she sexy? Uh... I don't know. Uh... Mm... - You tired? - Yeah. I just... I have to be up early. Can I get a hug? I think I can manage that. James, you ready? Here, no, I'll get that. I got it. - Okay. - Don't worry. Not joining us, huh, Sam? Sure you can survive a whole weekend without my daughter? I'll have to try, sir. Don't really have your sea legs, anyway. That is true. Remind me next time. I got some pills for that. Ah. So, you taking the new one? You bet. 130-footer. Stiegel keeping you on land? Yeah, mostly. Guess you pretty much dug yourself into that hole. What's your plans If you lose? Doing my best not to lose. Try not to burn the house down while we're away, hmm? - Will do. - Ah. - Hey, Jimmy. - Have fun, pal. Ready to go sailing with grandpa? How bad was he? The usual. Do you have to go? I'll be so bored without you guys. You're so sweet. It's only a couple of days. Be back Sunday night. Okay. And, uh, If you get lonely, you can always call that witness. I love you. Love you. "Is intended for companionship and modeling services only." Can I get a pre-paid phone, there? Executive privilege. Uh, hi, yes. Uh... I was, uh, looking on your site, and, uh, I'm just wondering how I could, uh, make an appointment with, uh, Christy. Christy, yeah. Great girl. She's one of our favorites. My name's Mona. I just need to ask you a few questions. Uh, what, uh, what questions? What was your name? Oh, yeah. Okay. Uh, my name is, uh, Bob fisher. And what do you do, Bob? I'm a, uh, I'm a lawyer. Okay, Bob, is there something that you can tell me about yourself that I can share with Christy? Oh, I don't know. I'm, uh, Caucasian. 6 feet, 190. What are some of your hobbies? What do you like to do, Bob? Not much of a movie guy. I...Read a lot. I like crime novels. Well, I'm sure Christy will like to dress for you. Do you have any preferences? Uh... Maybe like, uh, like a tight sweater. I don't know. But you do know what you like, yes? Yeah. Have you ever used an agency before? Uh, no. Okay, perfect. My favorite kind of client. So, once you get there, You'll leave your money in an envelope on the counter. And once we know that everybody's fine, safe, happy, and comfortable, then We'll start the hour. And If you're not happy, all you have to do is call, and We'll make sure We'll make you happy. We have plenty of girls. She'll be at the Stanwick hotel. Have you been there before? Stanwick, yeah. Yes. I know where that is. Room 209. Yeah, and If anything comes up, Bob, give me a call, and I'll do the same for you. Okay. I'll be on time. Thank you, Bob. Thank you. Shit. What floor you heading to? Uh, 2, please. Thank you. Hi there. Hi. So, you must be, uh... - Christy. - ...Christy. Your hair looks different. Oh, I love this suit. - Oh, thank you. - Don't tell me. It's Canali? Wow, that's impressive. Uh, I have the, uh... Oh, you can just leave the donation on the counter. Right. So, yeah. First time, maybe? Might be. Well, I am flattered you chose me, then. I can already tell you're my kind of guy. Sorry, I'm... I don't know how this works. Bob, do you like scotch? Why don't I fix you a drink? Uh, yeah. Okay. Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. - Yeah. That's good. - Cheers. - Cheers. I seriously love this fabric. You have really good taste. Uh, thank you. Yeah. Worked at a clothing store in college. Wound up spending most of my paycheck on clothes. And now I sound like a girl. No. No, even men need to be pampered. Yeah. I, um... I used to work as a massage therapist. So... I know how important it is to have someone around to take care of your needs. Go ahead. You must have a really stressful job. Yeah. I can feel it in your shoulders. You want to take a shower with me? I'll do it myself. You want to come join me? I can't do this. Uh... I'm sorry. It's my mistake. Well, there's no need to rush. Thank you, but I-I-I have to go. I'm... I'm sorry. Let me help you. Thank you. You married? Yeah. 13 years. 13 years. Yeah. How old are you? We were married young. I see. What? Well, I can understand why you're here. It must be hard giving your youth away to one person. It's a lot of things. She cheated on me back in school. I thought, uh... You know, It's before we were married, but I... yeah. Are there things she won't do? Things you want to try? Uh, yeah, sure. I like to try things. Is that okay? God. How are you doing? I'm good. You want to fuck me now? Fuck! So, any plans for the rest of the day? Sorry. You don't have to answer that. No. I, uh... I have no more appointments, If that's what you're asking. I might go lingerie shopping. Hey, do you always, uh, kiss on the lips? I thought that wasn't part of it. You're sweet. Well, Christy. It was nice to meet you. You know, you should make an appointment with my friend clio. She's the top girl at the agency. She only sees referrals. Maybe the three of us could have some fun together. Sorry, but this was a, uh, a one time thing. Well, I'll tell her about you in case you change your mind. Trust me, You'll definitely like her. Thank you. - Thank you. - Sure. - Dad! - Hey. Wha... what are you doing home? We got back early. Thought we'd surprise you. Where you been? Uh, we had a meeting with some of the agents on Stiegel. Weekend? That's a drag. - Yeah. - Your hair's wet. You been to the gym? Yeah, stopped on my way back. Good for you. Want to come eat? Uh, yeah. Smells amazing. With more than 800,000 federal workers standing to lose their paychecks... You nervous? I'm just wondering If It's the smart move to do this right now. He knows I can't talk about Stiegel. Nigel Coaker's on "meet the press" every other week. He's barely gonna know who Stiegel is. Which one? Your call. You know, don't over-think it. Just relax. Let him see the man underneath. Many estimates suggest a shutdown could cost the government... Nice. Just a few more. Good. So, Sam, your mother... um, you've cited her as being a source of inspiration... was arrested on a number of occasions in protests during the '70s. What does she think about you becoming a federal prosecutor? Well, she passed away before I got the job, but... I hope she'd be proud of me. Would she have supported your prosecution of, uh, medical marijuana facilities, for example? Well, Nigel, my mother taught me from an early age to fight for justice, protect those who are vulnerable. The law's the best way to do that. The U.S. attorney's office prosecutes those who break it. We don't decide what the laws are. No, but you pick the cases you pursue. So, that means there is a moral intent. Now, If 20 states have a medical exemption for it, uh, how can the issue be black-and-white? Because it is. Nigel, I want to thank you for including me in your piece. Oh, anything for Jeannie. Listen, Sam, If you're interested, I'd like to talk to the magazine about doing a longer profile on you, maybe I can trail you in the office. You know, um, do a "day in the life" kind of thing. Well, our meetings are usually confidential, but I'm sure we can arrange something. Look, I got to get James to school. You got any more questions? Yes. When are you running? Mama's gonna pick you up. Your father seems to think he'll go far. If he can handle the pressure. What do you think? I don't think he likes me. Oh, he's just sensitive about his mother, that's all. Mm, well, I think he's intimidated by the size of my reputation. Hmm? How are you two doing? Great. Things are a little crazy, but we're great. Well, I'm glad to hear it. There's a piece about the Attorney General race. Oh, yeah? I need to watch that. They mention me? No, they weren't singling anybody out. You want me to record it? Sam? Uh, yeah, that'd be great. Thanks. Is there a history of cancer in your family? Uh, my mother died from liver cancer. But, you know, she was a heavy smoker and big drinker. Have you been with any new sexual partners recently? Well, uh, I'm married. But yeah. One other one a few days ago. It was just one time, though, and I-I used a condom. Well, there is a bump, but It's probably an ingrown hair or something. In all likelihood, I think you're fine. Ladies and gentlemen, senator Edward Pollan. Thank you, Jeannie. Your exemplary work with the edible schoolyard project is an inspiration to all of us. You know, I often ask myself what we can do in Washington to help shape our children's sense of place. Sam Ellis. - George Hiller. - Yes. Glad to finally meet you in person. Absolutely, sir. That country club thing, that was a heck of a move. I understand that you're looking at Attorney General. Well, I'm not looking at any job beyond my current employment. I got something better. What'll you two ladies have? I'll take a champagne, please. - Bourbon for me. - Yes, ma'am. Who are you? Jeannie? Noah. How's the boss treating you? Oh, total slave master. He drag you in for that FBI meeting last weekend? Uh, no. Guess it must've been above my pay grade. Well, don't worry. You'll make it. You want a drink? Senator Pollan? You sure? He's gonna give up his seat? I got him to promise not to go public yet, but It's done. Now, Pollan Says he's gonna announce in a year. When he announces, we pull the trigger. You quit your job and you jump in the race. But I got to know now whether you got the balls for this. I'll have to think it over. Well, think it over. But remember, I'm the other woman here, so don't keep me waiting. Now, Nigel Coaker's already agreed to write the longer article, which will keep things alive. You just cultivate that clean image, 'cause your mythology is your best asset. Look, I know you're... Hi, there. So nice to meet you. I love your tuxedo. Is that Armani? I'm the one who gets you there. I win these things. So, why don't we pool our resources? I'll bring in my boys, and you and Jeannie bring in yours, and We'll work together and get the right team around you, and there's just no telling where this stops. You with me? Absolutely. We should definitely keep talking. It was very nice to finally meet you. You should see my friend, clio. Care for a nightcap, congressman? What, are you drunk? You're not drunk enough. Would you come to bed? We should be celebrating. Aren't you excited? We would be scrutinized under a microscope. You know that, right? We have anything to hide? Of course not. But you know these campaigns get personal. Certain level of brutality, exposure. Just want to make sure It's the right moment while James is so young. Well, James isn't like his friends. He obsesses about presidents the same way other boys obsess about dinosaurs. I mean, isn't this exactly what you always wanted? What? I just noticed how adorable you are in my shirt. I just... right now. Come here. Come back up here. No, no. Don't do that. Mnh-mnh. This way. I love you. I know all the sacrifices you've made for this. I'm just not sure about Hiller. Everybody knows he plays dirty. Well, his candidates win. I need to know you still really want this. That you're, um, the same idealistic guy I fell for... Who's gonna change the world. Maybe one with a little less hair, but yeah. Same guy, I hope. Then I'll be there. I believe in you, Sam. Just do whatever you need to do to make it happen. Executive privilege. Hi, this is, uh, Bob fisher calling back. Uh, I'd like to make an appointment with, uh, with clio. Hi, Bob. Um, yes, clio. Christy had, uh, said she'd, uh, tell her about me. Um, I'm sorry, Bob. She's out of town at the moment. Well, when will she be back? I'm not sure. Well, when will you know? I don't know, but, um, I-I can make a note to call you. Uh, okay. Is there another girl you'd be interested in? Did you look at Donna on our website? She's available. Donna, yeah. The brunette. Right. Yeah, that's fine. Sure. When? You know, I've been asking myself what possible wisdom I can impart to the bright young minds of tomorrow. And I was gonna say, "be anyone you want to be." If you want to be an attorney, be an attorney. You want to be a ballerina, be a ballerina. If you want to be a fireman, be a fireman or an astronaut or a playwright. Technology. I mean, he can talk directly... But then I realized that's ridiculous. When are we gonna talk about ethics reform and campaign finance? I can't be a ballerina, an astronaut, or a playwright. I'm just not built that way. Because really, you can only be you. Get your message across. But maybe that's what I'll impart. Be you. - Coaker's piece. - Morning, Sam. Whoever that is. Be honest about your weaknesses, but capitalize on your strengths. Get to the core of who you really are, because the sooner you figure out who that is... The sooner you can decide which grad school to blow 100 grand on. Thank you. This bother you? - No. - No? I can touch you any way I like? Uh-huh. Huh? What If some guy wanted to cum in your eye? On those pretty lashes. You're so pretty. Why do you let guys do this shit to you? I don't know. It's just what some guys are like. Well, some guys aren't supposed to be. Especially in my line of work. Doesn't make a difference, does it? That's not the point. It's just basic human engineering. Fighting that really make you a better person? The world doesn't work the way it does when you're 19. You'll see. Oh, whatever. Rules are just rules someone made up. None of my clients are 19. And most of them are married. If that makes you feel any better. I didn't say I was married. Sorry. I talk too much. Don't get mad, okay. I just don't see why pretending you're someone you're not makes you any better. That's all. Sure you're okay doing this? I mean, come on. Isn't there something better out there for you? Did you have a favorite subject in school? I like what I do. And I like you. You want to see me again? I never see the same girl twice. Oh, poor Bob. It's okay to come out and play. We knew Sam was destined for politics, but I always thought Jeannie would end up being the prosecutor. Really? Me? Wow. You're the one with the background. You could jump back in any time you wanted. Probably. I just didn't realize I'd miss James so much being in the office all day. Your charity work will look better on a first lady's rsum. Oh, God. No pressure, Sam. Who wants dessert? Sam. Come in. Pollan's calling a press conference for next week. Thought you said we had a year. It doesn't matter what I thought. I couldn't hold him off any longer. Well, what about Stiegel? Am I supposed to drop the case in somebody else's lap? Pollan's got cancer. And It's getting worse. I'm... I'm sorry about that. Look, Sam, I-I know you wanted to try that case, and I respect you for that, and I know that Kirkland's probably gonna but this field is gonna get real crowded real fast once the news gets out. This is game time. You announce, Coaker writes his piece, you're the man to beat. Okay. "Okay"? Is your head in this? Just took me by surprise, that's all. Well, this is the perfect time to get used to surprises. You ought to get yourself some bigger nuts. You got one week. Executive privilege. Yes, hello. This is Bob fisher. I need to cancel all my upcoming appointments. Things are a bit crazed right now. Oh, that's too bad, Bob. I have a note here from clio to tell you that she's in town. Just for three days, though. She knows you've been inquiring, and she's willing to meet. Clio? Her schedule's almost full, but she's free Tuesday. No, that's fine. Thank you. Constantino is running for sure. There's no way that's happening. Please give me another viable name. Bradford. Bradford? Mm-hmm. I like your pictures. Noted. She's got charisma, but she doesn't have money. She doesn't have donors. Constantino's gonna top our million in commitments by the end of this week. Constantino. Running or not running? He'll run If I don't. Oh, I like the balls on this guy. This is what I like. This is what we're selling. Confidence, hope, optimism versus a three-time loser. Success versus failure, all right? Versus corruption, actually. - Ideas? - E.J.'S right, guys. I just think we need a platform before we want to start getting the message out. I want to have the announcement on a college campus. I want him surrounded by people under 30. I want him swimming in people under 30, you understand? Hello? Hi, is this Bob? Uh, yes. Hey, It's Laci. I'm... I'm sorry to call you directly, but I might be changing agencies, and I just wanted you to have my number. Can you talk? Uh... Not exactly. I-I just wanted you to know how much I enjoyed the other day. And it'd be great to see you again. Uh... Okay, well, I-I have it now. Yeah. Sorry again. I hope I'll see you soon. Okay. Okay, bye. What phone was that? Uh, FBI phone. They heard something on the wire, needed advice. I'll see you tonight, okay? Of course. They're kind of overpriced. That's the point. It's my treat. Isn't my wife a knockout? Yeah, very flattering. She gets self-conscious. I understand. A lot of women do. - Where are you from? - Brazil Brazil? Well, never been. I think you would like it. Probably would. What's your name? - Tora. - Ah. Sam. Do you think they're too young for me? Not at all. They're stunning. We'll take them. You didn't miss anything at the conference. Your son is a model student. Good. I'm sorry, sir, but your card was declined. It was? It's probably just the machine. It happens every now and then. Would you like me to call them? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's fine. Try this one. Hm. What have you been buying lately? Everything okay? What's going on, Sam? What? I thought we were having a nice afternoon together. Yeah, I'm just not sure why you felt that I needed a $400 pair of sunglasses right at this exact moment. You know, Jeannie, I took time out of my schedule. I canceled an appointment. With whom? I jus... is this about the... the Brazilian girl at the store? No. But now that you mention it, that was fucking embarrassing. If you really are going to become a candidate... "If" I become a candidate? You're gonna have to learn to deal with flattery from girls like that. You can't just buy whatever shit they're selling. What's bothering you, Jeannie? Just say it. - Just spit it out. - Is there someone else? No. I don't believe you. I'm sorry. Well, what am I supposed to do about it? There's nobody else. Come on. Executive privilege. Yes, It's, uh, Bob fisher. Uh, does clio still have any times available? Hey, Bob. Um, yes, she does... 5:00. Yes, today. You want me to pencil you in? Okay, I'll take it. Uh, where? We have two officers that are gonna be contacts. How'd it go today? All right, I suppose. Sam's not exactly an open book, but he's good. He's very, very good at what he does. It's only 4:30. He's done already? No, I think he's got a 5:00 outside the office. Get out of the fucking way! Hi, I need to check the balance of my card. It was declined. Uh, all right, what are my options for payment? $2,000. Can I open a line of credit? Fuck! Shit! Sorry. Come on. Call 911. Are you all right? You okay? Hey, just stay down. - No. - You sure? I'm fine. Hey! No, they're not ready. Not now. Executive privilege. Hi, this is Bob fisher. I'm not gonna be able to make my appointment today, but I, uh... I-I think you may be under investigation. I don't know, I just... I think they have surveillance at Clio's hotel. I could be wrong. Can you help us? Help you? Uh, no. No, I can't. I'm sorry. Just destroy your records. Just do whatever you need to do. Just disappear. Hello. Please don't hang up, Mr. Ellis. I'm asking as a friend. Can you help us? Who is she, Sam? What happened? Why were you at the Saint regency hotel? You can interrogate me later. Just let me rest. Sure. Give you time to prep, right? Jeannie, please. This? What the fuck is this? Hmm? Hush money for your girlfriend? It's, uh... It's a donation. You don't treat me like some stupid suburban housewife, Sam. I outpaced you in every fucking law class. I was earning a higher salary than you until... fuck me. I don't understand. You're my best friend. You don't do this kind of thing. Not to me. The nurse said you fractured a rib. I wouldn't move too much. What am I supposed to do? Do I, uh... should I leave? 'Cause I won't be the victim here. You saw what that did to my parents. I'll walk before that happens. We're not your parents. Then get it together. If not for me, do it for James. He looks to you for how to behave. And whatever mess you're in, you need to dig yourself out of it now. I'm going to get our son. You're welcome. We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. Hello. Noah, It's Sam. I need you to check something out for me. Uh, sure. What's up? Nigel Coaker called three times. I don't want to talk to him. Noah's in your office with the meeting you asked for. Okay. It's been mostly FBI so far. We've handled a couple of warrants. They put in a request for a wire, but I think It's too late. The agency's rolling up fast. What do we know? Some interstate, some international activity. For the right price, a V.I.P. Client could bring a prostitute to New York or Paris. At the very least, I think we've got them on the mann act. We sure about that? Not 100%. And the agents want to move now? Who's on it? Park and Strellitz... solid guys. They don't want to see it slip away. Well, I want to come on board and help out. And I'll lead the case. Is there a reason you would need to, sir? Is there a problem? No. It's your call, of course. It's just I was hoping to try the case If it came to that. I used to volunteer at a clinic that helped prostitutes get out and get clean, and I saw a lot of girls go through there. Even at the high end, there's a pretty intense psychological toll. I think what Flynn is trying to say, sir, is that we'd like to stay on the case unless there's a compelling reason for us to switch. You sure you want to spend your time on this? You think I'm chasing headlines? Is that it? You're right, Ms. Flynn. It is an important issue, and that's why I want to be more involved. I want to make sure it stays on the right track. And If it goes to trial, you can have the case. Fair deal? All right, tell the agents we're transferring the case. I want to see them in here at their earliest convenience. Noah, hang back a sec. A buddy at the bureau slipped me the lead on this, and I don't want to burn him, so If anyone asks, I heard about it from you, okay? You got it, chief. James, honey, no. Otherwise, they're gonna keep you back in that class. You okay? Yeah. Fine. Sure. Already read it. Okay. See you tonight. Okay. Word is the FBI sent it upstairs yesterday. Why the fuck would they do that? Look, I talked to my buddy at main justice. He said they split it. They bumped the case to New York, and the rest is going to opr, which only happens. If someone in this office is implicated, right? Jesus. Any idea who that might be? You know, Noah, I'm gonna call you back. Jesus. Hey. H... I know you called. Leave a message. Detective Brixy. Ellis, how you doing, man? You gonna nail Stiegel to the wall? You are a regular fucking hero down here, man. Yeah, I know. Thanks. Couldn't have done it without some solid police work, right? I-I need you to run a number for me. I need an address. Can I help you? Uh, yes. I, uh... is Jennifer here? Just a second. Thank you. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you here. Um... It's Jennifer, right? What the fuck are you doing here? Can I come in? My mom's in there. It's really, really important. Uh, is there somewhere else we can talk, then? They already brought me in for questioning this morning. It sucked. Cops really creep me out. What did they ask you? They said I can't discuss that. Listen, you need to get a... a message to the agency. You need to tell them not to volunteer any information, okay? The FBI doesn't have a case. - Everybody's in custody. - It doesn't... no, I mean they got every single person. You have to think of a way, though. There has to be some way to get in touch with somebody. There's nothing. No, I'm serb... - what about the book? - There's nothing. - They're gone. - Can you text somebody? - One of the other girls? - What the fuck, man?! You think they're just gonna use up their one phone call - to see how Laci's doing? - Just think! - Just think! Just think! - The fuck? - There is nothing! - Just think of everybody! - They are gone! - Help me out! I never even spoke to them in person. It was all just over the phone. Fuck. I am so fucked. This is, uh... shouldn't have said anything. You don't have anything to worry about. I recognized you, you know. You're a lot better-looking in person than you are on TV. I was gonna go poli-sci before my mom got diagnosed. She has cancer, doesn't she? My mom died from cancer when I was about your age. You guys close? Yeah. She was kind of out of control. But... I just got into this to help her out. I'm all she's got. But once you're at the party... You should get out. I-I already switched agencies. These guys have been courting me for a while. They're super-discrete. It's okay. It's all good, right? You don't have to worry about anything. Everything's gonna be fine. Wait. Can't we, uh... I've got, uh... It's all I got. I can go to the bank after If you want. Right here? Yeah. Sorry I'm late. All rise. The honorable Catherine Liu presiding. Well, we're off to a roaring start. Apologize for the delay, your honor. Be seated. Not you, Mr. Ellis. You're not going to be here that long. Let's hear your motions. Right. Uh... Hey, um, there's two FBI agents that want to speak to you. I put them in your office. I hope that's okay. That's fine. Thank you, Dalia. And next Friday's my last day. I don't know If you knew that. Let us know where you land. Mm-hmm. And I wanted to apologize. I never meant to complicate your life or... or your wife's. You didn't. - Gentlemen. - Mr. Ellis. - Sam Ellis. - Agent park. I'm agent Strellitz. Agent park. Have a seat. You know why we're here? You tell me. Why this get passed up to main? How familiar are you with executive privilege? Uh, not very. I stepped in 'cause I was concerned about, uh, some of the warrants y'all asked for. How did you hear about the case? Uh, Noah, one of my a.U.S.A.S told me about it. Our investigation started with a particular elected official moving large sums of money around. We thought he might be embezzling funds. Turns out he was a client at the agency. - Hmm. - Started to build a list. High-profile public officials, mostly state. All of whom are clients and many of whom... and many of whom were social friends of a colleague of yours here. Kirkland? Mm-hmm. We think maybe they asked him to hold up the investigation. Has he ever mentioned the case to you? Uh, no. Not at all. He ever mention the agency or prostitution in general? Maybe the occasional off-color comment. We're using an escort as a witness on an unrelated identity-theft case, but... I believe she worked for a different agency. And you yourself have never had any contact with the agency or any of its employees? Not that I'm aware of. You were in the hospital on Tuesday. Is that correct? Yes, I was hit by a car crossing the street. Then you passed out four blocks from the Saint regency hotel. I'm not really sure where I passed out. The police report could clarify that. I'd be careful here, fellas. Do you have a case? 'Cause it sounds like you're fishing. That's exactly why I wanted to check the warrants. If you have any information that could assist the investigation, we'd be extremely... do you have a case? We suspect that someone tipped the agency. They started rolling up, destroyed all their records. That's why we moved in. But we think we were too late. Okay. So, you gonna charge them with something? No. Well, hopefully You'll get them next time. Y'all should've come to me first. It was nice to meet you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Are you a married man, Mr. Ellis? 13 years. I'm married 38 years myself. I've seen every kind of husband. You can imagine for every sort of indiscretion. Guys telling themselves. It's just a little vacation from reality. Or that they're some other guy when they step into that room. And I have seen grown men break down and cry when the chickens come home. Even If you're getting away with it, you only get to be one person under the eyes of God. And these guys, they got to be asking themselves at the end of the day. If you're the guy that walks through that door or If you're not. Have a good day, counselor. You know, they say that jogging is shit for the knees. So I hear. You followed me? You want to grab a coffee? We need to have a chat. How's your lovely wife? Probably sitting a lot more than I have lately. And I heard you had a visit from the FBI today. They were briefing me on a case. Mm-hmm. Is that all? That's funny, 'cause, um... My sources said it was a little bit more than that. Yeah? What did they say? I think you know. Hmm? You know they haven't got a case against you, Sam, and there's no doubt the pressure from the top will get them to drop it. And from where I stand, I still think people have the right to know the truth about their, um, assistant U.S. attorney and aspiring future congressman. You know It's really the hypocrisy that offends most people, and you're quite good at fooling everyone. But soon, people are gonna know what you really are. Then they can make up their own mind about it. Now, I want to give you the chance to tell me your own story, and maybe... maybe they will forgive you. If you make them understand. When are you running the piece? Soon. I have nothing to say at this time. Edward Pollan, the three-term senator announced today that he intends to retire at the end of the current legislative session. The unexpected decision leaves the playing field wide open given pollan's 17-year tenure in the office. Normally one of the senate's most outspoken... Yeah. Want cheese on your burger? Yeah. Yeah. Hi, mom. Here you go. Can I give Jack a lettuce leaf? Sure. Just wash your hands, okay? So, where have you been? Around. I saw the announcement. You talk to Hiller? Not yet. He wanted some photographs of your mother for the website. There's a box in my office. Back to business. Something wrong? No, sweetie. Just, um... just hungry. Thank you. Just take your time. If I talk to you, will you give me time to resign and get my affairs in order? That's a poor choice of words, but okay. Well, first, I-I want to apologize to my family. To my wife and son. And my colleagues at the U.S. attorney's office, with whom it has been a great honor and privilege to serve. There are no excuses. Why take the risk? I don't know. I don't know. It's gonna take me a long time to figure out. Jeannie thinks the world of you. Off the record. How are you gonna break it to her? Well, she already knows, I think. You think? Why do we hold public servants to a... to a higher standard when it comes to marriage and fidelity? We're flawed like everyone else. I set out to help people. I never said I was better than them. Go talk to your wife. Jeannie, we need to talk. It's over. I'm gonna resign tomorrow. What? Why? Coaker knows. Knows what? Come on, Jeannie. You already know. What is it I'm supposed to know? You want me to say it? For the past few months... I've been a client of an escort agency. "Been a client"? How would you want me to say it? You make it sound so clean. I have been so afraid that somebody would find out that now I feel I... I don't know. I feel relieved. I know that sounds horrible. When this blows over, I'll get a job on the civil side. Something with less hours and more money so I can spend more time with you and James. Maybe you can go back to practicing law, If that's something that you wanted. Jeannie, I need your help here. I'm splitting apart here. I can't imagine... just shut up! What are we talking about here? How many other girls did you fuck? 5, 10? I mean, you can tell me. Do you not think the wife has a right to know? What was it like with them? I don't know, Jeannie. You don't know? Why didn't you just have an affair, Sam? That was my worst fear all along. But that... that would've made you human. This makes you sick that you view women that way. And there isn't one person I can blame, not one bitch I can point the finger at. You didn't even give me that! Sorry. If life with us was so fucking terrible, why didn't you just fucking go? I didn't want that. I never wanted that. Then what, Sam? Help me understand. Was our routine so stifling? Was that it? Was it your crazy mama who wanted you to be the next Kennedy? Was it me? Was it my dad? I know he talks down to you, but he put a roof over our heads. He started your political career. Thank you. Thanks for reminding me. You know, I felt suffocated, too, but you know what I did? I started a fucking vegetable garden. But you... You couldn't even talk to one journalist without destroying everything we worked for. No, he already knew, Jeannie. He already knew. You think you can do any better? I'd like to see you try. Riding me is not the same as doing it yourself. Coaker never liked me. He was doing this for you and your father. This was my fault now? So, we should all feel sorry for you?! I never asked anybody to feel sorry for me. Please tell me it was worth it for that few minutes of excitement. Or is that why you did it? So you could have a secret from me. From everyone who believed in you. Well, at least it was mine. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, buddy. I suppose you'd like to come in. How'd you find out? Just because I'm old doesn't mean I'm lazy. Here you go. Attagirl. Don't write the piece. It's a matter of time before he brings himself down. That doesn't mean you have to humiliate me in front of the entire world, in front of my son. If It's not me, it'll be someone else eventually. Let it be somebody else. Why the fuck should I? 'Cause I'm asking you to. I didn't write the piece in the first place. Now It's getting interesting, and you want me to stop. Look, I realize It's your job, but is it worth destroying my family to sell a few fucking magazines? I didn't break the law. Where as you, my dear, now you just found out your husband's fucking prostitutes. Now all you can do is defend him? How many students did you fuck in exchange for better grades? I mean, is it really any different? It's not about me, right? This is about you protecting your ticket to the top. I mean, that's all you really care about. I don't think you're really bothered about any of them other women, I mean, 'cause you just like him. I mean, what does he do? Does he pull your hair? Does he talk filth to you? Or are you content to allow his young whores to do as they will with him? Just as long as you can sit on that fucking throne. Oh. You're your father's girl, yeah? Now I know I'm digging in the right place. Fuck you. Anytime, Jeannie. Since you were 16. Any fucking time. Okay. I beg your pardon? Call it an even trade. What? We both know you haven't been staring at me since I was 16, Nigel. More like 13. I'm still the same girl, so... Come on. What do you say? Coaker's not gonna run the story. What did you do? Remember everything we talked about? Remember all the goals we set for ourselves? Let's not throw that away. But what If I can't do it anymore? Bit late for that, don't you think? I didn't think you had it in you. Go to hell, Sam. Let me ask you one thing. What did they have that I don't? Nothing. Sir, you wanted to see me? Have a seat. I know the FBI asked you about me, Sam. I'm sorry about that whole mess. They were just grasping at straws. Shouldn't have happened. Listen, I know you're gonna go after pollan's seat. Well, I haven't officially decided anything yet. Just wanted you to know that I'm all for it. We need guys like you in D.C. Still see things clearly. Been at it as long as I have, everything looks gray and murky. Thank you, sir. Fucking "a." Look at that. Wow. Hmm. Better than we could've imagined. Senator? Senator? Your wife just called. She won't be able to make it on Tuesday, but she'll be coming down for the governor's ball on Saturday. All right, that's fine. Just make sure she has a pick up at the airport. Yes, sir. Do you want us to come in with you? No. We have some private business to discuss. You go have lunch. I'll call you when we're finished. Senator. George. Good to see you. Coffee? No. Kicked the habit. Everything in moderation, huh? That's right. How's the family? Your son doing all right? Can't run him for congress till he's 25. Well, We'll see. So, you liking it up here? Well, Jeannie doesn't love it, but her charity keeps her at home mostly. I like D.C. it suits me. Good. 'Cause you might be here for a long time. If I have anything to say about it. Reelection campaign headquarters are opening up next week, and I talked to the governor this morning. You can expect a formal endorsement. Glad to hear it. Sam, I do want to talk to you, though, about your... Your zipper problem. Now, it doesn't surprise me. And, uh, I don't really care what you do in your spare time. But the day you signed on for this, you put your life on probation. Your time on this planet as a human being who eats and shits and fucks like the rest of us, that's over. You got a patriotic duty to be squeaky clean for these people who would turn on you on a dime, and that is the contract. There may be some people who want the truth... In a courtroom. But outside, they want to believe that you're somehow better than they are. They need that fairy tale. It's the only thing that society has to keep it from sinking into the muck. That and wise policy. It's under control. That's all behind me now. Well, that's... that's all I wanted to hear. I suppose that, uh, If we ruled out every candidate who ever stepped out on his wife, it'd be just pussy-whipped nerds running the country. We don't want that, do we? People still need heroes. Let's give them one. Good. Now, here's the first round of donations from our friends, and that's just the beginning. And, uh, Sam, I wouldn't spend a lot of time on ethics reform right now. You don't want to make a lot of promises on that. And besides, you got a lot of other subjects that you can tackle first. Well, I don't know about you, George, but I can handle two things at once. You are a quick study, Ellis. You'll do all right.
