You know, I think you might be getting as good as me. You'll never be as good as me, but you're getting there. - You're getting close. - DAVID: I'm way better than you. MICHAEL: Perfect. What... (LAUGHS) What, are you trying to take a little bit off the top right here? - DAVID: Yeah, you need a haircut. - MICHAEL: Yeah. - Yeah. - DAVID: Watch this. Ready? MICHAEL: Yeah, go. - Nice! Nice! - DAVID: See? Ready? Wait, wait. Upside down. - Boom! - MICHAEL: Nice! Nice! (LAUGHING) Oh, man, that was great, huh? DAVID: Oh, yeah. - MICHAEL: Turbulence. Turbulence. - (LAUGHS) No. - MICHAEL: Turbulence. - DAVID: Oh, no. - MICHAEL: Turbulence! - DAVID: (LAUGHING) No, no! - MICHAEL: Turbulence! - DAVID: Whoa. Ah! - Where is it? (LAUGHS) - Turbulence. - It's over there. Where is it? - (LAUGHING) No! MICHAEL: Okay, bring her in for a landing, now, okay? DAVID: I got it. MICHAEL: Right, nose down a little bit. Oh, it's windy. It's windy. Can he do it? Can he do it? Can he do it? Can he do... Aw...(LAUGHS) Oh! Whoo! Yeah! That is a dead stick, my friend. Absolutely perfect, bring it right in to us. Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it. (ENGINE STOPS) What? Boosh! Unbelievable. Who taught you how to do that, I wonder? DAVID: I don't know. I guess I... Instinct. - Instinct? - Instinct! You know what you can do? BOTH: (IN MOCK NEW YORK ACCENT) You can shut up! (IN MOCK NEW YORK ACCENT) You can shut up. No, you can shut up! I want a milkshake. You're not getting one. You're getting buttermilk. DAVID: Dude, did you see that landing? MICHAEL: You get warm buttermilk. Thumbs out. Big smiles. This one's a looker. - Hi - Hi. Sorry, y'all, I don't usually pick up hitchhikers. Especially people as shady-looking as you are. Well, if it's the little dude you're worried about I can vouch for him. Actually, you seem kind of suspicious to me. If he looks so shady, Mom, why'd you marry? I don't know. I ask myself that every day! All right, y'all ready for some house-hunting? Haven't we hunted every house in the city? Yeah, but we haven't found one yet, Dad. And our lease is about to be up and we are gonna be out sleeping under the Congress Avenue Bridge. - That's awesome. - Not awesome. It is awesome. No. MICHAEL: Yes, it is. It's closer to the University. I can walk to school. Yeah, I'd love to see that happening! (BOTH LAUGH) I hope you brought your checkbook because this is the one! - This is it, huh? - Yeah! Right, we haven't heard that before. Oh! Hurry, come on. Before someone else snaps up this gem! Oh, this one looks cute. Ah! Rosalba. It's not done. Where are the walls? Oh, but you said, "open plan." Open plan. No, no, no, no, we need, um... - Walls? - We need a house that's done. Look. Walls! Uh? Huh. Yeah. But no windows, Rosalba. Uh, it's like a dungeon. I like this one. Hmm? (LAUGHS) Oh, yeah. - Yeah, windows! - Look at this, man. That's good. Light, natural light! Yes! This is, this is a lot more our speed. - Rosalba, how much are we talking for this one? - Uh-huh. - Yeah? - Oh. (MUMBLING) Um... This one is just a touch above your price range. - How much is a touch? - Just a smidgen. - Like, 20? - Above a hair. Forty? What? - More than 40? - Come on. Let's go. - Rosalba! - Come on, Rosalba. Ay... Did you find anything? - No. - Nothing we can afford? Nothing we can afford. (LAUGHS) It's all right. Maybe we'll find something when we get back from San Antonio. San Antonio? Uh-huh. Thanksgiving with your family. We were there last month. I know, but this month it's Thanksgiving with your family. So, now that there's a turkey on the table, it's supposed to mean more? My dad probably put the Christmas decorations up already. I did get a call from your mom yesterday. She'd really love for us to think about Christmas. Christmas, too? You know, David talks about it all the time. I got a better idea. What? Cancun. Again with Cancun? If we order the tickets now we get awesome rates and it's awesome-ly fun, come on. - I just, I know... - Think about it. Just think about it. I know Christmas is hard for you. Sunshine. Beach. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. I know what you're waiting for. What? (IN SPANISH ACCENT) Massage. No! Not in the creepy voice! - Massage. - Not in the creepy voice. Give me a massage, yeah. Without the creepy voice. Canc... Cancun. No. (LAUGHS) (IN SPANISH ACCENT) Where you get good massage. So, the ancient Greeks took the idea of hospitality quite seriously. It could mean the difference between life and death. For example... When Paris... Betrayed his host... And took Helen back to Troy... Professor Walker? MICHAEL: Mmm-hmm? - One quick question? - MICHAEL: Go ahead. So you're saying what the Greeks did is kind of like when we celebrate Christmas? (STUDENTS LAUGHING) No, I'm saying just the opposite as a matter of fact. Personal gatherings and celebrations were powerful, they were genuine. They were very spiritual for the ancient Greeks. Just like Christmas for us now. (STUDENTS LAUGH) Um... No, Christmas has become so completely over-commercialized that's it's really lost any... (ALARM BEEPING) Okay, Kylie, nice work. We've run out of time. See you Monday. Thank your friend here for, uh, no homework. All right, watch the master now. You watchin'? This is why I get paid the big bucks. Ooh! That's your "S". One more for "HORSE." We're playing "HORSERADISH." That's, like, seven more letters. Yeah, sure. Okay. If I make this one, we get to go to San Antonio for Christmas. How 'bout if you make this shot, you get to pick where we go for lunch, all right? Come on, Dad. Grandpa said that he'd put up so many lights, you could see it from outer space. (SIGHS) I don't doubt that. But we're going there for Thanksgiving and I think that's enough, all right? Go ahead, your shot. David. Okay. Wait. So, if I make this shot, we get to go to Grandpa's for Christmas? I mean even if you don't. (EXHALES) Hey, look. Grandpa put up Burp, Snort and Poot. Yeah, he probably should just leave 'em up all year round. - CLAIRE: Whoo! - LILY: Hey! Y'all made it! - THEO: Hey, hey! - Look at that beauty, I love it! - THEO: Hey, Suze. - Hey. Howdy y'all! Yoo-hoo! Travis! Oh, honey! So happy you're coming for Christmas. Yes. It's great. Good to see you! You look beautiful. - Happy Thanksgiving. Thanks for coming. - Thank you. Come on in. Hey, brother. Hey, sis. So I hear you're here for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year! - Grandpa! - MA: What did you do to your hair? David. God, you're getting so big! Hey, Pop. Michael. Wanna help me get the food inside? - See you in there. - See you in there. Here's my fruitcake! Da-dah! Oh, wow! Is that jalapenos? Close, there's jalapenos and poblanos and habaneros. So, do you want to try it? Come on. - It's really... - Um... I call it my "three peppers fruitcake." - I'm gonna have a little taste... - Just a little? ...'cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna fill up. - Well, you're gonna want more, because it's really amazing. - Mmm-hmm. Despite all these chilies, you can still taste the pickles and the pineapples and (IN SING-SONG) the prunes! Try this, it's so good! You gotta try Claire's fruitcake! It's kind of like an explosion of flavor in your mouth! I worked so hard on it. I made 12. I made a dozen. One for everybody in the family. We all get one? Oh, Claire! Hey! MAGGIE: Hey! Aunt Jocelyn! You made it! Of course we made it! Everyone, you remember Bob? He, uh... That's your second husband, right? Oh, God, no! Totally different Bob! (GIGGLING) All in. (SIGHS) You are so bluffing. When you dance, you go, cha, cha, cha And when you sing, you go La, la, la And when you laugh, you go... - Ha, ha, ha - Take it down. Yeah! Get the cards, get the cards. - ALL: Aw! - SUSAN: Suckers! Yeah, yeah! Whoo! Momma wins! David! What are you doing, man? Are you crazy? Think that's sweet enough? - Yeah. - Ahh-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh, everybody's tasting! TRICIA: Mmm. Well, I might as well do the same. (LAUGHING) I'm going to do it! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Get out of my way! Shut up! I'm doing it! What is going on? You have lost your mind! No, 'cause, see, there's a, there's a spring. - Okay. Uh-huh. - Yeah, I've... See, it's... We're good. We're good! We're good to go. I fixed it. He was just making sure it was safe. I see that. - Right, Dad? - Yeah, I got it. I did it. ALL: Yeah! (ALL CHEERING) ALL: Yeah! SUSAN: Yeah. MAGGIE: Here we go.

MAGGIE: Two purple thugs And an ostrich in a belfry - I was just checking my e-mail. - Uh-huh. Hey. CLAIRE: On the fifth day of Christmas My true love gave to me Five chili... Let's thank the Lord for this wonderful food. Happy Thanksgiving, y'all. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Thank you, Ma. So, Grandpa, when are you gonna put the Christmas lights up? (SMACKING LIPS) Oh... Maybe tonight after supper. I thought you and Travis might help me untangle all those lights. It's a big job. That sounds like a good job for y'all. MA: Uh, hmmm. Hey, Dad, when we come down for Christmas, could we stay the whole week? ALL: Oh, yeah. Yes. I like that idea. MAGGIE: Great idea. We're, we're not coming for Christmas. CLAIRE: (WHISPERING) What? Why? You're kidding. Why? It's Christmas. (SIGHS) Well, that's that then. Let's eat up here, folks, that turkey's gonna get cold. (EXHALES) (CLATTERING) Hey, son. Hey. (MICHAEL SIGHS) Years ago, when I was a kid, the whole family used to go to your great-grandpa's house for Christmas. The one by the lake? Yeah. And one Christmas in particular I remember because I was your age and Uncle David was about a year older, and all we wanted was one present for Christmas, you know. Just one. Racers. You know what that is? Ice skates. That's all we wanted. So after lunch, we snuck out of the house and went down to the lake. We were gonna race. Now, you gotta remember something about Uncle David. He... He was older than I was, you know. So he is a better skater. He's faster, he's stronger. So, one, two three, go! Flying down the ice, and guess what? I was winning this time. I was beating him. For the first time in my life, I was beating him. And I'm skating as hard as I can. I hear him calling my name. (WHISPERING) Michael, Michael! I didn't stop though 'cause I... I knew he was playing one of those tricks on me. You know, he was trying to get me to stop so he could... Skate past me. So I kept going, I kept going. I was winning, you know. I was going to beat him for the first time. And he caught up to me, and he grabbed ahold of my jacket and swung me around as hard as he could. And I fell down. And I went sliding with my face on the ice toward the shore. (SIGHS) I heard the ice cracking. I could, um... I could feel it cracking. I looked up... And, um, I didn't see him. And that's why Uncle David isn't here. Mmm. You did it. How do you feel? I'm really glad I told him. - I am too. - Michael? I'll let y'all talk. I got a favor to ask. We'd like David to stay with us here for a few days. Not for Christmas, but just a few days before when he gets out of school. Yeah, I don't... I don't know, Pop. You know, um... You and Ma kinda... We're getting old and creaky. (CHUCKLES) Maybe so. But I think we can take care of a 10-year-old for a few days. Okay. Thank you, Michael. (GUITAR PLAYING) Joy to the world the Lord is come Let Earth receive her king Let every heart prepare... Excuse me? Excuse me. I need the owner of the silver Volvo. We've got a little problem. I got it buddy. You're almost there. Straight back, straight back, buddy, yep, you're all, yep, all right. You got it, you're clear, all right. Merry Christmas! BEAT BOX GUY: Joy to the world The Lord is come Oh, no. Mmm, yes. Rosalba, do you have any idea when the new buyers want to move in? By the end of the year? This year? Come on. Oh, please tell us there's some kind of silver lining here. Of course there's a silver lining! Of course there's a silver lining! There's always a silver lining! What's the silver lining, Rosalba? (EXHALES) Oh, Rosalba! (GRUNTS) (BELLS JINGLING) (CLANKING) NICK: Hey! You're supposed to ride that bicycle. Oh, well, I... I tried riding it, but you can see how well that turned out. Well, that's life for you. You never know what's gonna jump up in the middle of the road. But you ain't the first guy I seen come dragging a bike outta them woods. I oughta start selling lemonade here. Or spare bicycle parts. NICK: Yeah, really. Listen, I, uh, I doubt I wanna know the answer, but... What are you asking? Oh, I don't know. It depends. Depends? You want the tour or not, I'm a busy man. Come on. MICHAEL: Unbelievable. NICK: Come on, I'll show you the rest of the house. Oh, man. (EXHALES) I mean, everything looks brand new. Did all the work myself, you know, I like to keep busy. Well, this is the kitchen area, you know, right in here. Cool. Cool. And this is the master bedroom. (CHUCKLES) Oh. - I don't know what to say, man, it's incredible. - NICK: Mmm-hmm. Well... I'll meet you downstairs. (EXHALES) Oh, well. Well, all right then. After you have seen the whole place here, what do you think? I gotta tell you, I think it's the most beautiful house I've ever seen. And I've completely wasted your time. Oh? This, this place is, is way outta my price range. I mean, way out of my price range. To tell you the truth, I don't have any idea what this place is worth. Uh, why don't you make me an offer? Just, uh, write it down, the old school time way. Yeah, um... Mister? - Call me Nick. - Nick, yeah, I, uh... I've looked at property for about a year around here with my wife... And, um... I have a pretty good idea what this house is worth. Mmm-hmm, so, show me. (CHUCKLES) Okay. All right, uh... Got a pen? Sure. Uh. That's a feather. - Thanks. - Mmm-hmm. This is easily twice what we can afford. So this is what you think is a fair honest price? MICHAEL: Yes, sir. Well, you're either the most honest guy I've ever met or... The dumbest. Take your pick. Either way, it don't matter. Buy you a lemonade. (CHUCKLES) Sounds great. NICK: So, my dumb, honest friend, what line of work you in? I teach at the university. History. - You married? - Yes. Kids? Yep, a boy. How old? He's 10. Piece of work? - Several pieces. - (CHUCKLES) Yeah, well. He'll get into a lot of trouble running around this big old house. Man, you're not kidding. Hmm, well, let's do it! - Excuse me? - You wanna buy the house or not? (STUTTERING) Nick, I've already told you. I can barely afford half of what this place is worth. Well, if you can afford half of what it's worth, half is what I'm gonna charge you. - What? - It's important to me that the right family wind up in this house. I'll take half. You're not serious? I'm serious as a heart attack. You trying to weasel out of the deal? No, I just might... I need an answer right now. I'm taking a huge leap of faith with you and I need us to leap together. What do you say? Yes! Yes! Yes! (NICK CLAPS) We got a deal. Oh, one condition. The people in this neighborhood take a lot of pride in it, you know. So you gotta do the right thing. It's important that you keep the lawn mowed and you can't paint the house pink. It's important that you keep up the neighborhood standards. I understand. No pink. It's very important. I get it. Absolutely. No problem. Congratulations, you got yourself a house. Oh, I... (LAUGHING) (STUTTERING) My wife's gonna... (EXHALES) Hey, Susan? (DOOR OPENS) Hey! It took you forever. Where you been? What? I bought a house. What? (LAUGHING) I think he just said that he bought a house. What do you mean "you bought a house"? I wrecked my bike. I'm walking it down the street, and on the right side of the street is this unbelievable house. Unbelievable house. There's an old man sitting on the porch, says, "You want it? You can buy it, "but you have to buy it right now. "You can't wait, you have to buy it right now." I bought a house, Susan. Hold on. You didn't sign a contract? I signed the contract. What? I tried calling you, but I got your voicemail. - Hold on. - MICHAEL: I got your voicemail. What? I'm gonna get between you and the knives. Because I don't want you to do something that you're gonna regret. You sign a contract. You bought a house without consulting me. Without consulting us. Yes. Michael. Did you get scammed? Okay, do you think I got scammed? I did not get scammed. I mean, you fall off your bike, some man walks up to you, takes you to his "mansion"? Susan, it happened so fast. Hey, Mom? After you finish killing Dad, can we go look at our house? Let's go right now. Come on! - Let's go. - SUSAN: Let's go. MICHAEL: Let's go right now. Let's see this house. Dude, you're in trouble. Hey, Nick! NICK: Hey. How are you doing? Didn't think we'd come back? NICK: Welcome back. Good to see you. You too. Got my family. This is my wife, Susan. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hi, Susan. How are you? - My son, David. - Hey, David. DAVID: Hello. NICK: Come on, let me show you the house. Hmm. Hmm. Are those crown moldings up there? - Yes, yes. - Beautiful. - I like that fireplace. - NICK: Yes, ma'am. Mmm. Eleven foot ceilings? NICK: Twelve. Twelve. Hmm. Oh, nice hardwood floors. Yes, ma'am. Ah-ha. Oh, wow. Blue ceilings, that's interesting. That keeps out the bees. - I knew that. - Mmm-hmm. It's in the almanac. I'd heard that, I had heard that. Is this a pantry? - Yes, it is. - Oh! (GASPS) I've always wanted a pantry. I don't even know what a pantry is. I know, honey. Oh, this is just gorgeous, my goodness. (SUSAN INHALES) That is a beautiful room. Thank you, yes, it is. Is this all original? This, that, the bead-board up there, you know? Uh, yes it is, every bit. (SIGHS) Oh, my goodness. (GASPS) Wow! DAVID: (LAUGHS) We have a pool? You didn't tell me there was a pool! Of course there's a pool. I'm sorry, uh, kid. The pool's not included in the deal. Wait, what? Just kidding. I still can't believe you bought a house without me. I think I'll give you a pass this time, but... (FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRCASE) I've already picked out my room, and it is awesome! Well, you know, your husband here should've checked with you before he made the deal, you know, but I... (CHUCKLES) I have to admit I kinda pushed him into it. But say the word and I'll tear the contract up right now. Oh no, no, no, no, no. (LAUGHS) Well in that case... Y'all come back tomorrow and I'll have the keys waiting for you. I just, I... I can't help but feel like we're gonna wake up from some wonderful dream or something. Yeah, this is, this is unbelievable. Y'all turn this place into a home, and we'll call it even. Okay. (SUSAN SIGHS) Could you pull up to this house every day? Oh, my gosh, my gosh. How are you gonna ask him to get his stuff out of here? Why do I have to ask him? MICHAEL: 'Cause you have to ask. It takes a long time to move all that beautiful stuff out. - Is he here? - I don't know. Hey, Nick? Hello? SUSAN: Where is everything? (READING) Oh! My gosh. Unbelievable. You're not getting tired, are you, man? - DAVID: Nope. - Get up there. Oh, good, honey, those can go right into your cabinets. DAVID: Mmm-hmm. I can't believe how big the bedroom is. You could fit five families in that bedroom. SUSAN: But we don't have to! (DOORBELL CHIMES) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey - (LAURA LAUGHS) - GRIFFIN: Welcome to the neighborhood! We're the Oswalts from right across the street. I'm Laura and this is Griffin. (BOTH LAUGH) Wow, I'm, uh, I'm Michael. Susan. David. Hi. Well, here you go! This'll get you started! - Oh! Thank you! - Get us started? Nothing fancy. Just a dozen or so strings. Crackle. Clear finish. Christmas lights. My dad loves Christmas lights. Don't you, Dad? Yeah? Didn't Nick tell you about the neighborhood tradition? No, no-no-no. What's the neighborhood tradition? - Oh! - Every year all the neighbors come caroling and bringing over their Christmas decorations for Nick. For you now! GRIFFIN: This is Live Oak Lane. The Live Oak Lane. During the holidays, we're the most famous street in Austin. The Live Oak Lane Trail of Lights. This is that Live Oak Lane? Yeah! Pretty cool, huh, Dad? GRIFFIN: Everybody decorates. Every year we all go all out. People from all over the world come here just to see our street. Oh! GRIFFIN: Nick's house, your house, is always the crown jewel. That's why we bring over so many lights every year, so that your house will be even more spectacular than the last. Thank you. Oh, yeah! And I'll be happy to give you a hand. Putting so many lights on a house this size is a big job. (CHUCKLES) Wouldn't wanna be a bother. No trouble at all, I can come over this evening. We are so busy, uh, unpacking, with the move, and there's just... Stuff. We'll definitely try to get around to it. (CHUCKLING) They'll try to get around to it! (BOTH LAUGHING) All right. Thanks a lot. Great to meet y'all, thank you so much. Nice to meet y'all. Nice to meet you! - Bye. - Bye-bye! - (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) - Well, they seem nice, don't they? (EXHALES) The Live Oak Lane Trail of Lights. Michael Walker moves into the Live Oak Lane Trail of Lights. - That's funny. - It's not funny. It's pretty funny! And I think if our neighbors are gonna be so generous as to give us all these beautiful lights, the least we could do is put them up. Yeah, come on, Dad, it's the neighborhood tradition. Don't you want our neighbors to like us? No, I wanna understand why people spend days and days putting up thousands and thousands of Christmas lights so that people can walk past their house and ooh and aah. How about hours and hours putting up hundreds and hundreds of lights? Or minutes and minutes putting up dozens and dozens? How about no time putting up no lights? I think our neighbors will understand that. And leave us alone, you know?

See you whenever I get back. (ENGINE WHIRRING) (ENGINE STOPS) Ho. Ho. Ho. You think you might think about putting up some lights this year? Just because of the new house and it'd be so fun for David. Maybe? (DOORBELL RINGS) - I'll get it. - It's for you. Howdy, Michael. What is that, Griffin? It's a ladder. You know, I got to thinking I bet I know why Michael hadn't put his lights up yet. He needs a ladder. I don't. So, you have one already? No. Michael, Christmas here on Live Oak Lane is really something special. Everybody's included. We got a Jewish family, a Muslim family, there's a family from India. Heck, they got a Santa Clause with four arms and three eyes. It'll blow your mind. That's great. Look, Michael. These lights and these decorations mean a whole lot to a whole lot of people. Last year, a family flew here all the way from Japan, just to see 'em. That's wonderful. I don't mean to poke my nose into your business... - But... - Then don't. Boy, you don't think we have enough lights up there, already? No way. Let's put them all up. You know, I haven't used these lights for a long time. (SIGHS) Maybe we better test 'em. They still work. (EXHALES) I'll bet these lights haven't been used since... Since your father, your uncle and I used them. My dad used to help you put Christmas lights up? He sure did. I remember one Christmas, when the three of us put up so many lights, the roof sagged! No, it didn't. It did. And then, your father said, we have to remember Burp, Snort, and Poot. COLONEL: So, up they went on the roof and the roof sagged even more. Till everyone had to crawl around on their hands and knees.

He told me, "Grandma, I'm not a little kid anymore!" - He's not. - (CHUCKLING) Hey, what's this? I thought I might take it with us when I drive David back up to Austin. (SIGHS) What? Give it to Michael. Just in case. Oh, honey, you think that's a good idea? I don't have any others left, darling. Hey, Grandpa, I just thought of something. Maybe we could wait a few hours before we drive back. Till after dinner. And why would we wanna do that? Well, because then we could see the lights on the house lit up before I go. Your father won't like it, David. I told him I'd have you home before dark. Yeah, but we'd only be there just a tiny bit after dark. So he'll only be a tiny bit mad. David. Please, Grandpa. DAVID: I mean... We worked so hard on the lights and... It'll be my only chance to really see them. Five minutes at dusk. Not a minute longer. Deal? Deal.

(SIGHING) But you know, truth be told, it all feels... I don't know... Unreal, somehow. I know, Ma. I want you to come and live with Susan and me. - (EXHALING) - I know Maggie is a lot closer. (LAUGHING) Well, what makes you think that I'm gonna go living with either one of you? Because, Ma, we have a big house. We have plenty of room. I know, I know, and... It's a very generous offer. I tell you what. I'll come and stay for a few weeks until David is back to himself again. - Ma. - No! You hold your breath.

What do you need, son? I thought you were finally asleep. When people die do you think they can still see you and hear you? I wish that I could tell Grandpa... That I'm sorry. Sorry for what, son? It was all my fault. I didn't wanna drive back till after dark. I just wanted to see all the lights on the house lit up. David, that's not true. It was an accident. You had absolutely nothing to do with that. You have to understand that, okay? David, welcome home, honey. Oh, how good that you're here. Come on in! You know what? We might be able to rustle up some hot chocolate for you. - How about that? - That sounds good. I think he wants some more of that hospital Jell-O, Ma. Hey, man. You're not gonna eat that mac and cheese? I know it's your favorite. I'm just not hungry. Yeah. (SIGHING) David, I want you to listen to me. You are not to blame for what happened to Grandpa. The truck that hit you... The tire blew out. You had nothing to do with that. The driver tried to keep from swerving. He couldn't. I think I'm tired now, Dad. Hey, hey. Listen to me. That highway should have had a center barrier, man. It didn't. It was an accident. Nothing was your fault. Hey, you know what this house needs? Christmas lights. How about you take a couple of bites of mac and cheese... No. Dude, we've got this big giant Christmas tree out back. - You know how great... - (SHOUTING) No. You were right, Dad. Christmas is stupid. (SIGHING) What in the world? Michael? (GRUNTING) (PANTING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (GASPING) David hates Christmas now. He blames himself for what happened to Pop. (SIGHING) - I know. - I told him it was an accident. It couldn't have been his fault. I explained it to him. I explained it to him every way I know how. Well, sometimes that just isn't enough, is it? (SIGHING) Look at me, Michael. You remember all those years ago after it happened, you remember what your father said to you? Morning, noon, and night for months on end, you remember what your father said? "Michael, it wasn't your fault." He only said that 'cause he had to. Oh, Michael. You're a smart man. Who was it who gave you and your brother those skates? Hmm? Right. (EXHALING SHARPLY) Go get some air.

I thought we had an understanding. What do you mean? You promised not to paint the house pink, remember? Paint the house pink? Christmas lights. Not a one. It's not really living up to the neighborhood standards, now. Can I ask you a question? Does this really make sense to you? People celebrating the birth of Jesus by seeing how many lights that they can cram onto their houses? Come on, man. I mean, doesn't that sound like a bunch of... Horse hockey? Yeah. Horse hockey. Maybe it is a lot of horse hockey. I guess it depends on the way you look at it. Well, how else are you gonna look at it? Um, well... What ties a family together? It's not the blood. It's not having the same last name. It's the memories. Well I have plenty of bad memories. Well there's nothing you can do about those. But you do have a say-so over the good ones. Let's eat!

I got plenty of 'em. Yeah. You got more important things to be thinking about, anyway. I'm sorry about your son. But don't forget. Memories are what ties a family together down through the generations. And memories are the greatest gift a father can give his son. The last gift my dad gave me was a box of Christmas lights. You sure about that? You better take another look. Thanks, Nick. You got it. (INAUDIBLE) (LAUGHING) Oh, come on.
