 

                        BY MY SELF MY FRIEND I couldn't be happier! I'm so happy to hear that! What about you, Lina? Where have you been all these years? I have a husband, three children and a cat called Simon. No! I have a cat! So what? We can both have cats! What about you, Vera? I am a writer. I write poems, stories and big books. I am a singer. And you, Ine? I have a wedding dress, just like my mum, and my husband is a pilot. You spend your time flying! Oh, flying wears me out sometimes! Isn't she lovely? It is not funny at all. It torments me. "It torments me. " Come on, Lina! You always say the same! It's just a game. That is precisely why! Playing the happy woman torments me! We don't play! We are happy! We're just thinking our lives ahead. Exactly! I AM VERA. I am Vera. And this is part of my life. I am 29 today. I will be 30 in a couple of days. I am a Wonder Woman fan. I like daisies, the autumn and sour cherry candies. I also like writing. I like my job and I am good at it. EVERY PETAL IS AN "I LOVE YOU". PABLO Look! Look, honey! My report is on the newspaper. Won't you read it? - I have read it about 30 times. - But it's not the same! - What time is it? - Eight fifteen. Turn the lights off. I need some more sleep. Won't you say happy birthday? I said happy birthday last night. Come on, give a kiss. You come and kiss me. It's my birthday! Thank you. - Your father? - No. My boss. Hello. How odd! Yes, I saw it! Of course I saw it. I am very happy! Just today! Fine. Ok. Fine. Can you answer the phone Pablo? I really don't know mum. I'll call you later, ok? Yes, mum, fine. I'll call you later. Bye. She's so nosy! We'll buy the curtains today. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Did you like the chocolates? I usually send flowers but. Daisies. I mean daisy-shaped chocolates. Of course. Vera, you job was excellent. It deserved to be published. So, the column is published every fortnight and we'll discuss. The content of each report in advance. So, you mean. Let's get started! Oh! And these are the contest rules you asked me this morning. Legal size paper, ok? I put my faith in you! Thank you very much! Thank you! See you tomorrow. I'm sorry, honey! You wouldn't guess what happened! - The movie started ten minutes ago. - I know. I'm sorry, honey but. When I was leaving, Tanio called me to his office. - To give you more chocolates? - Silly! I got the staff position! He also gave me an approving smile on the contest I told you about. How odd! He used to be a jerk and now he gives you chocolates. Don't be silly! What? Are you jealous? Yes you are! You are jealous! You are jealous! Will you stop it, please? - I like it when you are jealous. - Will you stop it, please? You are always trying to change the subject. It was just a joke. Don't get mad. Pablo. What? Will you be long? I need the computer. I'm using it. You're not writing anything. Because I am thinking. But I am writing. I'm not writing now, but I am writing. Do you understand? Shall we have dinner? I'm not hungry now. Would you like to have dinner right now? Yes, I'm hungry! Well. Cook something for yourself. I'll get something at the delicatessen. Why don't you order over the phone? Because I don't want to. Shall I get something for you? Can I use the computer while you are out? - What do you want? - That. - You said you were not hungry. - It was an hour ago! What's up? Are you in a bad mood? I am talking to you! - Are you in a bad mood? - Yes! I am in a bad mood. Can't you see that I am in a bad mood? I don't want to talk now. You always say you don't want to talk. You'd better talk now or. It will hurt you. Because you swallow it and then it will hurt you even more. - Are you analyzing me? - No. Are you a shrink? No. I just try to help. I'm not analyzing you. Ok. Show me what you wrote. What? Wait! Don't! I know you are upset about the novel. Come on, let's talk! - I don't want to argue. - Let's read it together. Don't read it! I said no! Don't read it! Thank you! Why? I show you everything I write. But it's not the same. I write novels, you write reports. I won't argue! You are crazy, Pablo. - I am crazy? - Yes. You are crazy! Look at you! Staring at me all the time. - Stare at what? - Stare at me! - Stare at you how? - You pester me all the time! You get up my nose! This is my place. I need tranquility! Oh! Now Zarathustra needs peace in the mountain! Screw Zarathustra! Screw Zarathustra! I live here, too. And look around. It's all a mess! You have invaded the house. There are papers all over the place! The phone rings all the time! It's you! It's always about you! I can't even have dinner peacefully. Dinner has nothing to do with it! You're speaking nonsense, Pablo! Dinner has to do with it! And who the hell prevents you from having dinner peacefully? Nobody does! But I am fed up with this dinner issue! When did you last go to the supermarket? - I don't know. - You never went! I don't have time to go to the supermarket, Pablo. I am not interested in going to the supermarket, you know! Do you understand that? Absolutely. Lady Vera is not interested in doing the shopping, cleaning, tidying. Or being quiet when others need concentration. You are only interested in you! To hell with the rest! I understand perfectly. Have you seen my pink blouse? Can you see? There are thousands of them! It's so difficult to choose! You'll find the perfect for you. You have plenty of time, In,s. Are you crazy, Vera? Time is never enough. There are so many things to consider. Everything must. Hi! Everything must match; the tablecloth, the dress, the hairstyle,. - The decoration of the place. - Hi! You're always late, Nina! Hi! Did you choose one? No. I was telling Vera about it. I want to be dazzling that day. Marcos must think I am the woman of his dreams when he sees me. - Well, choose it together. - Are you crazy? He can't have a clue about it. It's a surprise! It's tradition, Vera. - Can I show you? - Sure. Vera! Vera! What's up with you? You're acting strangely. Nothing. Just daydreaming. These are Roberto's designs. It's ten o'clock. It's my turn. Pablo, would you like some? I can't find it, mum? Please, come! How do I look, Verita? - You look wonderful, mum. - Oh, come on! - What were you telling me? - I said I can't find it, mum. Vera, just today! Do you need it right away? Well, yes. It must be in the trunk room. Perhaps your father took it in the middle of our divorce! What time is it? Nine fifteen. Oh, my God! You may check downstairs. Have you seen my purse? I bought a lipstick. What time is it? Where? I told you in the trunk room! The keys are in the kitchen. - What does he look like? - I don't know. We've never met. It all started online. He works with Susana. She introduced us. He's divorced. He is a psychiatrist. He has grown up children. What time is it? You have already asked me, mum. How strange! He said at nine. He was probably an idiot. He wasn't worth it. Sure. He was probably an idiot. It's ten thirty. I am going to Gabriel's concert. I don't know where you are. I'll be late. Bye. Pablo. Hello. Hello mum. How are you? Shit! I've broken an egg! At the supermarket, mum. Where else? I think my report will be published on the Sunday edition. No, mum. I'm not happy. I don't know if I will take part in it. I haven't even started. This is gross! Nothing, mum. Have you ever broken an egg? I'll call you later, mum. I'll clean this up. Because I don't need a maid! I'll clean it myself! I don't need a maid! I'll call you later. Bye! A double treble stitch... And half stitches on each treble stitch of the previous row. Two chain stitches and a treble stitch. Repeat three chain stitches up. Two chain stitches and repeat one half-stitch on each half stitch of the last row. We'll repeat this procedure three times. Then. Let me see, Pablo. What? Come on. Stand up. Okay. Come on. - Wait a second. - It's just a second! I want to. - What is it? - I want to see if it fits you. - What's that? A coaster? - No! It's a scarf. - It's for a dwarf! - Don't move! Stand up straight. It's too short, isn't it? - Would you like a long scarf? - I don't know. But it's itchy. Is there anything in the oven? The cake! How's the cake? Mmm! It's delicious! Who taught you? Nobody. I taught myself. In fact, I took my grandma's cookbook. Doa Petrona's recipies. I read it. It's great. It has about one thousand recipes. Look at you! You are a hard working ant now. Good! Oh! I almost forget! Tanio called. The contest was postponed for a week. He wanted you to know. I don't care anyway. You don't? I thought you did. No! I don't care! I told you I was not taking part. Why do you insist? Hey! I'm not insisting! I just thought you had though it over. And you had changed your mind. You are so. Unpredictable these days. Unpredictable? Why unpredictable? Now you have started knitting crochet and it seems you won't. Stop until you do it properly. However, I think it's all right! I think it's good. You don't understand anything at all, Pablo! You don't understand anything about the cake I made! You don't understand anything about the crochet I knitted! You didn't understand anything at all! Calm down. You're overreacting. What's wrong? Do you think I want to do this? Do you think this is what I like? No, it is not what I like doing! I don't want to make cakes! I don't want to knit crochet! Do you think I like that? What I think doesn't really matter. What you want matters! Please! It's not about me, it all about you. No! It's about us! It's about us because I understand when you say I am selfish. I understand when you feel I don't take care of you or the house! I understand all that. And. I am terrified to think our relationship may go to pot! Because. Because I am trying to be the woman you want me to be. Oh, please don't! I like the woman you are! I don't know who I am! I don't know who I am! And I'll probably never know! I'm scared! I AM LINA. I am Catalina. But people call me Lina. Like In, s, whose real name is Mara In,s. I'm an Aquarius, my ascendant is Taurus with a Cancer moon. I am 27. I feel uneasy when I think I will be 30 soon. I feel kind of. Old! I'm not from this city. And I still find it hard to find my way here. The city is too big and complicated for me because I am a simple girl. Or at least that's what I think. Although it's cloudy outside, there is something deep inside. It's the passion in your heart which is burning day and night. It's music to iron, dream and imagine. It's music to iron and feel we are together. Music to win someone's heart, to imagine, to forget or fall in love. It's music to iron. See you on the next episode, my darlings. And, as always. Sweet, romantic, dreams! Hello Elvira? Were you sleeping again? Has anyone called? Mind your own business! No one in particular is calling me! But if anyone calls, don't forget to tell me, please. - Hi! We are home. - Hi! Is everything okay, Lina? Yes, Luca. Anita fell asleep at nine. She had eaten her chicken. - Everything okay! - Shall I call you a taxi? No, thank you. I'm in a rush, Guillermo. Wait. Here is your money. Oh! Don't worry. Give it to me on Thursday. - Bye. - Bye. Lina! Good night, Elvira! Has anyone called? I'm going to kill you! You could have set fire to this boarding house and you are. Only interested in your messages! Who in their right mind would leave lit candles in the bathroom? - What happened? - The curtains caught fire! One day, I'll throw your crappy good-luck candles away! Okay. I'll buy a new one. When he kissed her lips, Sleeping Beauty opened her eyes and. Offered him a tender smile. Eventually, there was a splendorous wedding to celebrate Zarzarroza. And the Prince's marriage. And they lived happily ever after. Ine, it's me. I can't find you. I'm a bit late. Wait for me. Bye. - Hey! - Hi, Lina! You're late again! - I'm sorry! I left you a message. - I didn't hear it. Let's go. It's late! - I saw a fortune teller. - And? She's wonderful! She really sees. Sure. What did she see? When will your prince charming arrive? How can you believe in those things? It's good for me! You don't believe in them because you don't need to. You have no problems. You don't... I have no problems! Come on! You have no idea how difficult it. Is to choose a wedding dress. I'm going mad! I have an appointment with Roberto Piazza in ten minutes, and I still. - Don't know what dress I want! - Look! The dresses I told you about. What? Come on, Lina! Don't you like them? No. - I don't like them. They are awful! - How can you say that? They are not my style or Roberto's. I can't wear that. You know what? Go to Roberto's on your own! I won't go with you. Music to cry, to imagine, to sigh, to forget. To win someone's heart. Music to iron. See you soon boys and girls. Good night. And, as always. Sweet, romantic, dreams! There is nothing to worry about. The man of your dreams is near. He's quite close, opposite you. Hello. Yes, it's me! My cousin told me about you. Friday? IT'S THE FIRST TIME I DO SUCH A THING. I AM SHY, NO INTROVERTED MEET ME. I HAVE NO MONEY. I DRIVE MY FATHER'S CAR. WHERE SHALL WE GO? Hi! I'm Exequiel. So, you like Chinese food. - Yep, I like it. - I love it. I like Chinese products like perfume. Look at this! Dragons didn't exist. It's a myth. It's a traditional. Environment. Wow! 15 pesos a chop suey! How expensive! - Anything to drink? - Yes. - What would you like to drink? - I'd like a "Cocucha-Cola". I'd like mineral water, please. - She didn't get the joke. - No, she didn't. Because she's Chinese. Chicken. I think I'll take some pasties. What about you? - Yes, me too. - They must be big. Look. Just for me! I've done breadcrumb statues since I was a child. I was around seven or eight. I call myself a breadcrumb artist. Just like a balloon artist twists. Balloons or a graphic artist twists gr. Graphs. And all that. Well, I twist breadcrumbs. My mum says it is fine art. What would she say, she's my mum. She says I should take it. Seriously. And she may be right! But I'm not persevering. That's bad. Art implies perseverance. Tortoises are my specialty because it's. Just two parts; head and caparace. Hey! You are in a dream world! Come back! I was saying. I'd like to make a Tyrannosaurus Rex. It's a. Tremendous challenge! But the problem is that bread goes moldy. And working so many hours for nothing. Karaoke! I love it! I need to go to the toilet. Just a minute. You can dance to the toilet. Well. - It was good meeting you. - Sure. - If you want, we may. - I'm a bit tired. - Well, someday. - Who knows! - Ok. I'll call you. - Lf you want. - Tomorrow? - Bye Ezequiel! Good bye! It's Exequiel, with an x. Hey, Lina! You forgot the signs. Oh, thanks. I just want to tell you that I tried to be funny. That's all. Good luck. Hi, Ine. Isn't he gorgeous? You ask me who? Aren't you watching him? He's more handsome than ever. The guy was an asshole. I'll tell you later. - I'd like to dedicate this song... - we can know who is? To Mara Rita. In less than 24 hours, you'll meet the man of your dreams. You may say I'm crazy, but I'm going for him. Donati! I'm not sure. But I don't care. Ine, I have the feeling that today is the day. The fortune teller said so, you know! Okay. I can't believe it! There he is! Yes, he's with other men. But wait! They are saying goodbye. Follow that car, please! But, it's Nacho Donati's car! I know. He's my boyfriend. I'll surprise him. How much is it? Seventeen pesos. Here you are. Ine, listen! No, I can't see him. There is a crowd in here. There he is! How embarrassing! He's there with two bitches who are harassing him. Ine, I have a plan. Call me in five minutes. Bye! Did you watch my program last night? - It was great! - Did you see my assistants? They were amazing! Pineapple daiquiri or margarita? Peach daiquiri. There was no coincidence. It's a bad start! Excuse me! The same drink, please. If we try, we may get to an agreement. What sort of agreement? The sort you prefer. I am an open girl. From Barcelona? Segovia! Excuse me. Hello. Hi sweetie! I'm at a party. I can't hear you. What? Really? I might go later. But don't wait for me, uh! You never know! Bye! Was it your boyfriend? Sort of. So why are you here on your own? First, because I AM on my own! Second, because I'm looking for you. It's a joke! I'm Lina. I'm... Let me guess! Yes. How did you know? Because I'm a witch. That's my job. Really? What else can you tell me? Well. I should read you daiquiri. Go ahead! Let me see. Wow! There is something wonderful in store for you! A close encounter perhaps. What kind of close encounter? A close encounter of the third kind. You are a brave girl! Brave. I like that word. Wait! Wait! I don't know what's wrong with me. It's okay. Just relax. Easy! Slowly! Hey, be careful! Slowly! I just can't believe it! It's the first time! The first time? You've been lucky. Perhaps you are tired, aren't you? It's normal. Look. I don't know you, but you know me. This is a difficult situation. I need to trust you. What are you talking about? - Listen, Linda. - Lina! My name is Lina. Okay, Lina. I'm serious about it. I am no idiot. I know my carrier is in your hands now. So, please. I think we must forget it all. We must keep it a secret. Okay? We may reach an agreement if you want. I work in the TV studios. I know people. Are you kidding me? You are an asshole! No, no. Don't get mad, Linda. If you speak, I'll be a dead man! - You're crazy! - Please don't tell anyone about it. Please, Linda. It's the only thing I'll ask you. Please swear it to me. I don't swear! Then, promise me. It's my public image. The media is ruthless with artists! It really is, Linda! How can I make you understand? I AM MARA. I am Mara. Just Mara. I like my name. It doesn't say much. Probably that's why I like it. I like simple things. I don't think there is much to say. Important things were already said or written. Sometimes I find the words I lack in books. In order to understand the point of view of radical feminists, we. Must start with Shulamith Firestone's analysis about... The Dialectic of Sex. According to this author, the fact that women give birth is central. To women's subordination to men. Gender inequality originated in. Patriarchy forced on women through their biology. I'll read you a quotation from Carla Lonzi's essay Let's Spit on Hegel. It says; "We must not be thought responsible for human race... continuity. Let us not give birth to children for the State or men. Let's do it for ourselves. " Would you like to add something, Mara? So, read the texts and tell me your doubts and thoughts. We'll be. Opening the debate next week. See you next week. Hello Mara. I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Brutrach. We need the final. Statistics. Please call. Bye Mara. You are not at home. I'm Tom s. I just want to talk to you. Madrid is a lonely place, like me. I'll call you black. Take care! I am like the she-wolf. I broke with the pack And fled to the mountains Tired of the plain. I have a son, the outcome of love without marriage... For I couldn't be like the others, another ox. They laugh and point at me. Sheep bleat as they see the she-wolf Because they know she-wolves come from the scrub Poor tame flock of sheep! Don't fear the she-wolf For she will not hurt you. Hi, Mara. Are you there? It's me, Vera. I am like the she-wolf. I broke with the pack And fled to the mountains Tired of the plain. It's Vera again. I've been calling you. Where are you? I'm worried about you. Call me. I have to tell you something. I'm pregnant. Tom s? Then who? Artificial insemination. I had been thinking about it for a long time and. But why? Why? What do you want to know? Nothing. I don't understand why you didn't tell me before. I didn't tell anybody. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm surprised. I'm very happy about it. I'm very happy. Congratulations. People freeze in the hope of an explanation. Are you okay? They are not sincere. I can see how they react. It's crazy. Tom s! Hi. I know you don't like surprises. I wanted to tell you I was coming. But I couldn't find you anywhere. Come in! When did you arrive? This morning. Okay. I propose a toast for this city and this reunion. To tell the truth, I am doing well there. Isn't it great? I had many opportunities. Good! The university is incredible. But I miss people. You won't reject the scholarship, will you? I didn't say that. You wouldn't do such a thing, would you? What do you think of me? I thought about something else! I've been thinking about us all this time. And I realized I love you more than what I thought. Wait. Don't! Tomas, don't. It's not like that. You have a life, a scholarship. I. I have mine. What upsets you? The fact that I love you? No. It's not that. No. It's that. It's not possible now. Go away, please. May 1968 was a turning point in feminism. The fray took the road... to liberalism. Organized political parties. To liberalism. Organized political parties. Imagine... Imagine, Sartre. Congratulations, Mara. Everything is perfectly well. The worst stage is over. Now we can say your pregnancy is okay. Good luck. Doctor, if my child wants to know about his father? Forget about it, Mara. It's impossible. But, do you know who he is? Donors have no name. Nobody knows them. We spoke about it. I keep trying to imagine what the baby will look like... but I can't not even in dreams. There is a baby. I know it because I can see myself carrying him. But. But I can't see his face! Whose eyes will my baby have? His hair. What will his nose be like? His facial features, his body. Who will my baby look like? Thank you for coming. I want to tell you something I didn't tell you. I don't know why I didn't tell you about it. And you must know about it. I'm pregnant. Who's the father? I did artificial insemination three months ago. I don't regret it. I want this baby. But something has changed. I don't regret it, okay. It's not that. I don't regret it. I want you to know that. I want you to know that. I want you to know that I' ve considered your proposal. And. And I think it might work. We might try. Are you serious? You can't talk to me like that. You have no right to do so. Who do you think you are? You can't control other people's lives! Are you asking me to share your decision? I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I'm leaving for Madrid tomorrow. You were right. It would be crazy to reject the scholarship. I AM IN? S. I am In,s. Mara In, s to be more precise. Mara just like my mum, who is called Mara Rosa like my granny. That's why I am called Mara. My brother broke the run of girls. They called him Mara anyway! Jos, Mara. It's not so bad. My dream will soon come true. I can't believe it! In fact, I always knew it would come true. What's that dress? I'm a bride. You are beautiful in it! When I grow up, I'll have a real wedding dress and I'll marry. Oh! It has always been her greatest dream! It's unbelievable! Children grow up so fast! I'm sorry about the church. Would you like some more coffee? No, Mimi, thank you. We have to get up very early tomorrow. Oh! Don't forget we have the menu tasting tomorrow. - You didn't tell me about it! - Well, I can't handle everything! Tomorrow noon, Inesita? Yes, at twelve thirty. - Twelve thirty? - Yes, twelve thirty. - I won't make it. - You won't make it? - I have a meeting. - Come on! Well, I'll try to manage. I don't know if I'll make it. Don't worry Mario, we are not all going. - I must go. - Dad! I have to check the beverages. My daughter marries once in her life. Are we all going? Roberto is right! Beverages are essential! - Besides, it's a matter of men. - Absolutely! First hairstyle trial. Hire antique car. Meet with DJ. Presents. Can you help me, Marcos? Shall I include these egg cups? What cup eggs, honey? Are you silly? Cup eggs to serve soft boiled eggs! Honey, I hate soft boiled eggs! So do I. But the babies. What babies? Let's go, honey. Please! Wha's wrong with you, Marcos? Are you in a bad mood? We are choosing stuff for your house, my house, our house! Don't you care? Party favors. Carioca dance. Make up artist. Table linen. Dress trial. Oh, my God! How do I look? You look good! Don't you like it? Yes, but there is a problem with the armhole. Hello? Hello honey! Yes, I called you because we have to rehearse the waltz dance. Yes, I said rehearse. My dad wants to rehearse the waltz dance with me! Are you in a bad mood? I don't understand you! You know what? Bye! Beauty spa. Waltz instructor. Invitations. Centerpieces. Jasmines perhaps. Stop it, Marcos! You are not listening! About what? About jasmines! Concentrate on this; color and perfume. Color, white. Perfume, good. Definitely jasmines! Do you like them? - Because. - Shall we turn the lights off? - No! We have to decide this first. - Come on. Turn the lights off! It's very important. I was all day trying to decide. - Ouch, Marcos! - What? - My hair! - I'm sorry. - You're spoiling my hairstyle. - Okay, but. Flowers are important for many reasons; centerpieces, decoration. My aunt who lives in the countryside. You know what? My aunt and uncle who live in the countryside are coming on... - Thursday. Stop it, honey. - What's up? They are having dinner at home and mum wants you to go. - On Thursday? - Yes, next Thursday. - My hairstyle! - I can't on Thursday, Ine! It's my bachelor party on Thursday. Sergio arranged it. Next Thursday? Yes. And Sergio said I must take a piece of your underwear. Can you imagine what I'll take? Yes! - Where are you going? - To the toilet. Hello, Li. It's Ine. Listen. Marcos' bachelor party is on Thursday. When is mine? We forgot completely! We must organize Ine's hen party. Yes, Lina called me. We forgot. Fine. Bye. So, we'll propose a toast for In, s and Marcos. And for the triumph of love! - At least in someone's life. - In my life. Pablo said he would call before coming. Suspicious! - Wrong apartment! It was for the A. - Oh, wrong apartment! What a pity! What are you laughing at, Ine? Come on girls, I'm not silly! Who did you hire? Nobody! I don't understand. Eat something! I'm eating. It's taking long, isn't it? What? Come on, girls! I'm so nervous! I've never been with one. Ine, what are you talking about? Lina, don't get me even more nervous! I just imagine he'll. Strip naked and grab me. Wait! Wait, In, s! There is nothing like that. Nobody is coming. Nobody! We didn't think about that. We know you don't like it. You don't like this kind of things. Neither do we. Come on, In, s! Don't be sad. This is our way of celebrating. It's all right, girls. It's all right. I am a bit sensitive. There are so many expectations, the pressure of. I'm fine, believe me. I need to go to the toilet. Just a minute. - So, table number twenty. - Yes. And table nineteen also. - Hi! - Hi honey! - Good morning. - Good afternoon! It's just after ten. - We have finished with the tables. - Yes, we have. Would my baby like some milk? Mum will serve you some milk. Have the people from Mar del Plata sent their confirmation? Yep. Great! So? So what? What about last night? Fantastic! What did you do? Plenty of drinks! They dressed me up like a whore! They took me to a male strip show. The typical thing! Ali, you ordered the flowers, right? It all is so strange! What? Move our stuff; sleep in our beds for the last time. Yep, it's strange. I remember the day we met in Bariloche. Really? At Rocket! Inesita, your dad is calling you. I'm going. Marqui, I'm very nervous! Everything will be alright. Trust me. Relax. I love you. It's the best I could get. Thank you, dear. Bunny, don't move, please? Bunny? Why bunny? Am I as plump as a bunny? It's just a term of endearment! Perfect! You are right! I'm as plump as a bunny! - Oh my god! You are wonderful! - No, I'm ugly! - You are wonderful! - Ugly! - Say something boy! - You're okay. I don't know. You can give your opinion, can't you? Hi! Hi! How are you? It's twelve thirty, my son. Hurry up, please! It's too tight. What? I'm out of breath. Come on! It's just for a short while! But I can't breathe. Don't make jokes. It's late! It's no joke. I can't breathe. What's wrong with you? I feel I can't breathe. I'll get your mother. - Marcos? - He is in the room. Excuse me. I'm the hairdresser. May I come in? Sure! - Mario! - Oh, hi dad! Where is Marcos? Marcos is getting his hair done. He'll be here in a minute. You are not wearing your kippah! I told you dad. There is no religious ceremony. I have an extra one! Give it to me later. I have to find Alice. I have the feeling there will be trouble here. Don't start with that mum, please! Go, go. Have fun! Oh, my dear Mario! How are you? It's so nice to see you! You were very kind to invite us. It's been a pleasure! You two look as good as always! Honey! I'd like to introduce you to the Justice of Peace. My husband. - Carlos Arregui. - Marcos needs you. Honey! I was saying that it's very kind of him to come on Saturday. - Have you heard me? - Yes, I heard you. I was telling your wife that we must start on time because it's my, mother-in-law's birthday. We'll throw a surprise party. We hired. - Puchito. - Who? Puchito. He's a clown for adults. If I arrive late, my wife will kill me! Don't worry. We'll start in a minute. Excuse me. My son needs me. Incredible! Children always need their parents! I can't breathe! That thing you sprayed on me is paralyzing... - my head! - Of course! The windows are closed! Oh sweetie, my baby! This heat can kill anyone! Mario! What are you doing there? Get a fan for him! Are you serious? He's feeling really sick, Alice. I am serious! He is just hot! We are all hot today! Mr. Bretman! Mr. Bretman! Is there long to go? We said twelve. Thirty and it's one o'clock. You know, my mother-in-law. Yes, I know. I need a fan! Where can I get one? I don't know, sir. - It's an emergency! - I don't know, sir! That's Marcos, father, right? Yes, he is. - I can't breathe! - Could you please hurry up! Shit! I need an extension socket! What? Why on earth did I send you to examine the party place! You don't even know where the sockets are! What's up? Oh my god! I'm going to die! I'm going to die! Oh my god! Move! Lt'll do you good. Mum, In, s says she is here. Mum said they are late. You'll have to wait. Who is late? Can you be more specific! I don't know. That's what mum says. It's not my fault! Do something, Mario! Your son has gone mad. What can I do? I'm leaving. Bye! So? The same as before. He's worse actually! Oh! Please do something! You are his parents! Marquitos! Stand up, my dear. Stand up. Marcos, stand up! Marcos! Give him a slap! It's a childish behavior! Wait a minute! He's my son! I've never given him a slap! So, please mind you own business! It IS my business! It's embarrassing! And you are so inefficient! I will not allow you to insult me! Don't listen to her! Go and get Mr. Goldstein, please. Who the hell is Mr. Goldstein? Marquitos, pediatrician! You said twelve thirty! It's just a second! Lend me your phone! A phone? Here you are! And buy some chocolates to your mother-in-law! Are you drugged, Marquitos? Baby, tell mum the truth! Here is Raul. What's up? What happens? I don't know. But, it's late and they haven't arrived. Yes, at twelve thirty. What can I do? Tell Puchito to wait! Panic attack. Something common these days. Anguish attack. So, it's a disease? I can prescribe a medicine for it. I'll prescribe Rivotril. Do you know where I can get Rivotril, or something like that? Excuse me! What do you need? Just. Rivotril. Carlos may have some. He's a doctor. Carlos, do you have? - What's the name? - Rivotril! - He needs some. - Rivotril? Come on, kid, don't play with me! Put an end to this sham! It's a psychosomatic disease, madam. Don't worry him or he'll get worse. Okay. But my daughter. Can she marry him or not? That's not important now! Is it not? Is it not? There are two hundred people waiting out there! My daughter is waiting to get married! The most important day in her life! And you say it is not important! And? Mum says you still have to wait. Did you tell mum that I'm out of breath? Everyone is out of breath. That's why Marcos is with the doctor. Doctor? What doctor? What are you talking about? Your mum says we have to wait. What's going on? Here comes the bride! Give her a big clap! Everything is all right, sweetie. Come with me. There is a little problem to solve. A little one! Then we'll start the party. Marcos! Help me. I'm dying, Ine! What's wrong? You are shivering! What's up? Mum! Can you leave us alone? Alone! Well. Well, you must wonder what happens. Nothing! Everything is fine. Marquitos has had a last-minute issue. But he'll be okay. So, let's have some snacks. And, have fun! Music, please! I'm sorry! Don't worry. Everything will be okay. Relax. I feel I can't. You can't what? I can't. What is it, Marqui? Speak. I can't get married! What? I love you, Ine. But. This is not what I want. I don't know. Please forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! Difficult times followed. It took me long to get over it. It took us long to get over it. Things do not always turn up as we expect. Dreams don't always come true in the way we imagined. But it's always worth trying. Excuse me! She's beautiful, isn't she? She's gorgeous! I have something for us all. I asked Lina not to read this email until the three of you were together. From here, I imagine the moment. The midday sun filling the hospital room. The smell of Vera's daisies. And the eyes of the baby Mara is holding in her arms. Somehow I want to be there. I want to feel close to you. And share, this time, real happiness. We have a reason to be happy, don't we? I'm fine. It's been a long time since the sun last came out in this city. But, I started to like cloudy days. Marcos is sitting for exams next week. We'll find out what future holds in store for us. I spend my time looking, looking for myself. You can't imagine how much I need you! But I know you are there. In front of the computer. And that we only need to press "send" and get our messages
