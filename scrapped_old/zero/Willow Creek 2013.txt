 

                        1 Ow. Are you OK? Here, hold this. Honey, I'm, I'm driving. Just hold it. Hey, that's my jam. All right. Say something. This is not safe. That's good. Keep talking. I'm not... what do you want me to say? Just keep talking. I got to adjust these levels. One, check one. Ah, brr... Ma made me mash my M & M's. That's good. Keep going. Uh, this is... check one. My boyfriend is a big idiot. Check one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. More. And, here we go again. That's it. And, I don't feel safe driving around this mountain like this, babe. No, that's great. Keep going. Uh, it's the cradle of life, the center of civilization. Men have fought for it, even died for it. What is that? One might say it's the most powerful thing on earth, so come on, ladies, show it a little love. Cleansing Washing Cloths from Summer's Eve. Hail to the V. That's great. What, what is that from? It's a douche commercial I didn't get. You didn't get that? Yup. Oh, man. I'm surprised. That was really good. Thanks, babe. You would, you could have been the next douchiest spokesperson in the world. - You're really funny, you know that? - Thank you. You think my vagina is dirty? Is that what you're saying? Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's a dirty V. - Really? - You have a dirty V. Have I ever told you how dirty your penis is, your cock? Uh, thank you. No, baby, you have a porcelain V. Your V is spotless. That's more like it. Yup, you're welcome. Action. Are you going to, are you going to say, "Action"? Don't do, don't do that. That's going to mess me up. OK. It doesn't make any sense at all, but... Hi. I'm Jim Kessel. I'm here at the Trinity National Forest along Route 96, also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway." I'm here with my girlfriend, Kelly Monteleone, where we plan on re-tracing the famed 1967 Patterson-Gimlin footage in our search for Bigfoot. What's that face? Just, it's your thing. Just make it about you, you know, no girlfriend, my name, all that. You don't want to be in the movie and now you're, you're Stanley fucking Kubrick. That's good. Oh. Oh, OK. Hi. I'm Jim Kessel. I'm here at Trinity National Forest, along Route 96, also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway." I'm here at Bluff Creek, where I plan on re-tracing the famed 1996 Patterson-Gimlin footage in my search for Bigfoot. OK. - Are you a little nervous? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. I can see it. I can see it. You know what? I just want you to take these off. OK. - I want you to loosen up. - Yeah. - And, just be yourself. - All right. You know. It's like, "Hey, lets..." Just talk and... We're here in this beautiful place. Use it. OK. OK. Hey, what's up? I'm Jim Kessel. I'm here at the Trinity National Forest, along Route 96, also known as, "The Bigfoot Byway." I'm here at Bluff Creek, where I plan on re-tracing the famed 1967 Patterson-Gimlin footage in my search for Bigfoot. Won't you join me? - Boom. - Oh, nice. - Yeah? - That was good. - That felt good. - Yeah. - I'll buy that. - It was good. - Nice. - Good, babe. - Thank you, babe. - Yeah. Did you see the buckshot on this sign? What's that? Right here. And a bullet hole. Great. That makes me feel good. You'll be fine. You don't want to look stupid. Honey, I'm afraid of a lot of things, but I'm not afraid to admit that I don't believe in Bigfoot. I know, but just... How can you, how can you prove there isn't one? Babe, I, I said that I, I will come on this trip to, to help you with your film and it's your birthday and we're going to have a great time, but I'm not about to say that I believe in Bigfoot. You don't have to say you believe in Bigfoot. I'm just looking for, I don't know, "Maybe there is one, Jim. I'm not really sure, but maybe you're right, maybe there is something out there." OK. You want to know why I, I, I firmly believe there isn't? Why is there, has there never been a Bigfoot body that's been discovered? All this time and no one has ever found one? That's a little odd to me. Who knows? When's the last time you found anything dead in the forest? Do you know how many millions of acres there are of... Plenty of times. ...unexplored forest out... plenty of times. OK. You're seeing bones in the forest? Yes. Listen, who knows? Maybe they bury their bodies. I don't know. There's forest is so thick out here, babe. You can't see three feet in front of you. I mean, there could be a hundred Bigfoot corpses - within half a mile in here. - Yeah. Nobody would ever even know it. There could be a hundred dead leprechauns out there, too. Ha, ha, yeah. But no one, no one has found those either. - Yeah, OK. - Uh-huh. Uh, we're talking two different things here. Aren't you curious to know why for thousands of years, all right, people all over the world have reported seeing an ape-like creature walking through the woods? Not really. Well, then, why are you here? Because I like being with you. What? Oh, boy. Now, you're mad. No, I'm not mad. Honey, we can believe different things and still be a couple. It's OK. I just don't want you to think I'm crazy. Oh, I know you're crazy. I wouldn't be with you if I didn't know that. I just don't believe in Bigfoot. - Hi. - Action. Babe? I'm sorry. I'm so used to saying it. OK. Hi. I'm in Willow Creek, Mecca to the Bigfoot Community. Oh, yeah. That's it? Yeah, that's it. All right. Oh, check it out. Home of the Bigfoot Burger. And ammunition. Can't say I've ever dined in a place with both. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, you know, they hold a gun to your face if you don't order the Bigfoot Burger. Oh, God. I love the, uh, the, uh, artwork here. - It looks like Bigfoot... - Oh, yeah. ...he really likes his doughnuts and coffee. Is he toasting doughnuts? Could be bagels. Oh, and there's the other one. - Look, it's like us. - Yeah. There I am bringing you flowers and there you are making doughnuts and coffee. Making breakfast and there you are prancing over, giving me my flowers for the day. That's awesome. That girl seems pretty happy to be missing. Who is that? I should take a picture of you, of what you would look like if you went missing. So that if you ever go missing, I can... I can show what you would actually look like. OK. We'll dirty you up. Give me your missing, give me your missing photo face. - No, I don't think that's your... - No? No. How about this? Um... That's pretty good. - Yeah? - Yeah. But I do feel like they all smile. Yeah. Maybe you would be happy if missing. Why would you be happy to be missing, babe? I don't know. See that? So, lets see the Bigfoot Burger. Oh, check it out. Oh my God. Whoa. Yeah. It even has the toe marks. Look at that. Do you think this is, um, real Bigfoot meat? - No, honey. - No? - This is just a Bigfoot Burger. - Oh. It could be real Bigfoot meat. You know what would be really funny? - Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm. - Is if, um, his... Yeah? Please, finish your thought. I was going to say that it's a good thing, um, his feet are his most prominent attribute. Or else, we could be eating really big weeners right now. - That's a whole other restaurant, honey. - Hmm-hmm. - I'll take you there... - Mmm. ...some other time. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm. - How is it? - Wow, this... It's actually really good. - It's pretty sweet. - Hmm-hmm. Mmm. Mmm. - Well, look at this, babe. - Oh, yeah. What is that? What? Wow. It's a Bigfoot mural. Is that a van Gogh or what do you think it is? Yeah. He's pushing a wheelbarrow and hoeing a garden. And, very, he seems clinically.. - depressed actually. - Yeah. "Bigfoot sad. Bigfoot no want to work in garden." Why are they forcing him to do all this work? I don't know. What the fuck is this? Like, they got him as a day laborer or something. "Bigfoot help you put up house for berries." I would avoid man, too, if I had to do all of this shit. Yeah, no shit. Maybe he just doesn't want to work, - that's why they can't find him. - Yeah. "Bigfoot tired of working." All right. Let's get out of here. This is so great. Is this... so, this is the town? This is it. - Oh, there. Bigfoot. - Yeah. He's all over the place. Oh, there he is. - Hey, buddy. - Chubby guy. Oh, I got to get this. Bigfoot Avenue. This must be where he lives. Yeah. Is that where we're staying? Oh, yeah. Bigfoot Motel. Oh, great. Yeah. This place is heaven, babe. This is the great O'Mah statue carved by Jim McClarin out of one giant piece of redwood right around the same time Patterson shot his famed footage. I like his bangs. - You do? - Hmm-hmm. They have the whole flippy thing going on? Well, he didn't. He wished he could have re-carved him after he heard Albert Ostman's account. You're really making me horny. Go up there and stand next to it. Why? For a scale. Go on. How come people don't know how big I am? I could be huge. Check that out. Get closer. He's a nice-looking guy, kind of cute. Don't do that, baby. Baby, just don't do that. Seriously. May I help you? - He's lonely. - May I help you? Yeah. Do you mind if we interview you? I told you I was new at this. OK. Here we go. Hi. Are we going? Hi, I'm here with Nita Rowley, who's worked at the Willow Creek Visitor Center for the last 20 years. How are you, Nita? I'm doing well. Thank you. Well, good. I have a question for you. Do you know of anyone or do you know personally the exact site of the Patterson-Gimlin? Uh, no, I do not. And, um, has there been any recent sightings of Bigfoot or Sasquatch in the area? No, not to my knowledge. Are you a believer? Not at all. No, huh? OK. Is it safe to camp here? Uh, you have to be on the lookout, uh, for bear, mountain lions, rattle snakes, um, but it's, it's safe, I mean, you take your chances. Have you ever heard of anyone being attacked by a mountain lion or a bear out here? Uh, yes. I haven't heard the, uh, bear attacks. Uh, basically, they get into the garbage, uh, and come in to steal your food. The mountain lions, uh, will attack. What would you do if you saw Big Foot, Nita? I don't expect to see one. Um, I, I really wouldn't be surprised, um, because I just don't believe in it. We're rolling. I got really lucky. Um, we're here at Bigfoot Books with the owner, Steve Streufert. What's up, Steve? The usual thing, Bigfoot every day out here in Willow Creek. Yeah, nice. I heard you had a little, uh, you were just out there. Yeah, we were out of Bluff Creek. Yeah, Bluff Creek. Uh, it is about 29 miles north of here, you come to the bottom of Bluff Creek there. Hmm-hmm. And that was where the Patterson film was shot. Yes, of course. Also, these, uh, footprints that you, uh, may have seen before... Yeah. These were cast out in Bluff Creek in 1958. Sure. Wow. So, these are the Jerry Crew cast? That is from the same track way of... Yeah. ...the famous Jerry Crew track was taken from. That's incredible. And that's where, obviously, you know, they coined the name Bigfoot... Yeah. The contractors on the road building project out there and the loggers, um, had very strange activity going on out there. Yeah. They were cutting a new road into this virgin timber, so, um, they started finding these footprints out on the dusty plowed road and they called it, "Bigfoot." Apparently, there were some that saw it out there, so, uh, you know, the big feet were connected - with a creature that was... - I didn't realize that. ...that was also throwing a big 55 gallon fuel drums and, uh, spools of metal logging wire down into the creek, uh, vandalizing their camp, in general. So, that's where that name came from in 1958. Right. This is the model that was used by Roger Patterson. He rented this and came out here and, - you know, it's very heavy. - Yeah. He, he, this is what he used to film while running across a, - a regular gravel bar and rocks in the... - Yeah. ...in the creek. They were also used for, uh, making home movies and, uh, amateur films like pornos. Oh, that's awesome. Wow, that's so heavy. Tell me a little bit about, um, the Patterson-Gimlin site and just how to get there, man. Oh, well, um, you can take this road, I can show on the map, and you go down that road. - It's probably easier that way. - That would be great. You come down to the bottom and there's an old camp site there, you know, and, uh, when you're at that camp site, you basically just take a right. You have to bushwhack and go through the forest. - My girlfriend is OK with that. - But it's not... you won't get lost. Just follow the sound of the creek on your left and look at the hill on your right. You just keep going straight between those until you come to a big gulch and you'll see it all blasted out with rocks and log debris and, uh, - that's the bottom of the film site area. - Wow. So, you go, you're going to have to go down in the creek. Be careful not to twist your ankle, you know. Just getting to the site, is it kind of dangerous or would you...? Uh, well, there is the thing we called, "The Curse of Bluff Creek." What's that? Uh, wait, that's sort of related to The Curse of Bigfoot, but... The Curse of Bigfoot usually means that, you know, like you're going to get divorced, your friends will all think you're crazy, uh, you'll be, uh, impecunious and you'll spend all of your days searching for something that you never find. Um, that's kind of a classic thing with the old researchers, you know. Hmm-hmm. But, um, that's sort of a joke. The, the, um, the real truth of it is that you're out in the middle of nowhere, you know, so you, you don't really want to, uh, just go out there unprepared, you know. Right. There's no food and there's no water unless you want to drink the wild water and hunt the wild animals, you know. There are some berries and things, which you have to know the wild plants, so I'd say, you know, go prepared and have the tools you need to survive, right? - Yeah. - A lot of people aren't ready for that. They think there should be a, a campground there with a like porter potty or something. You know, you're not in the... It's still the wilderness. I mean, it's... Yeah. It's not technically a wilderness, but it's still pretty wild, you know, and we've seen many, many bears, uh, out there, um, so, watch out for that. We are going to go see Tom Yamarone. He's the Bob Dylan of the Bigfoot Community. Where does he live, Mordor? - No jokes around him, all right? - So, can I look him in the eye? OK. No jokes. - All right, great. - We're rolling. This is like Christmas in July, uh, because I'm here with Tom Yamarone and, uh, Tom, I know you know Bob Gimlin. I do. So, uh, why don't you tell us a little bit about, um, the Patterson-Gimlin site? Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, it's a site that's so remote and what you're going to love about it is, when you get in there, it's a steep canyon, there's a running creek, there's forest that's thick and you're going to feel how isolated they were. They were really truly in the wilderness. How do you think those guys were feeling that day when... I mean, they've been, they've been searching for a little while and to finally, to finally come across what was, you know, there by the riverbed...? Yeah. Well, you know, I'll tell you, they were bored, not bored, but they had, they had no success up to that point and, boom, they come around that log jam and there's this big hair-covered creature standing there, starts walking away from them and they knew right then they had won the prize, you know, if they could get it on film and so, Patterson scrambles, Gimlin watches him, and they, they think they got it. So, they were, couldn't have been more excited. You know, the only thing that would be better, if there was a song about it. I just so happened to have written one. Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Yamarone with, uh, "Roger and Bob." Rode Out That Day, yeah. Roger and Bob rode out that day "fill that log jam got in their way They got lucky on Bluff Creek that day Yeah, they got lucky when she walked away Roger and Bob rode out that day Roger and Bob were gone a week Just riding them forests around Bluff Creek They made maps... Sorry. Blew it. - That's all right, man. - That's OK. - That's all right. - They shot some film. They shot some film of a Bigfoot there She walked on two legs and was covered in hair Roger and Bob had quite a week Yeah. Al got a call on the telephone Roger and Bob, they stopped by his home They told him about their good luck And Roger said, "I filmed that son of a buck" Al got a call on the telephone Here we go. OK. Hi, I'm here with, uh, Shaun White Guy Sr. She's, uh, a resident of the Hopa reservation. And, Shaun, I understand you have a Sasquatch story that you'd be willing to share with us? Um, yeah, I just have a small story. It's, uh, me and my dad, uh, went on a camping or, you know, a, a Christian... cut. - It's Hoopa. - Hoopa? Yes, Hoopa. Okay, good. Thank you. Hi. I'm here with Shaun White Guy Sr., and, uh, she is a resident of the, uh, Hoopa Reservation, and I understand you'd be willing to share a Sasquatch story with us? Um, yeah. Um, when I was little, about eight years old, I, uh, wanted to go on a camping, a Christian like, camping trip with my dad... Hmm-hmm. And so, I asked to go and he said I could go and, um, we were heading towards like, Ferndale, Garberville area. I wasn't too sure, but I know I was going. And so, um, we're following my Uncle Tiny, and then, all of a sudden, um, a big black image came in-between the cars and my dad turned the steering wheel and we flipped into the like, the gutter, and we looked up and there was Sasquatch walking in front of us, up towards the, the like, field, a big huge, it was a big square open field and there was the tree range and we actually got to watch him, uh, walk in front of us and he was tall and he was like, long-haired... - Were you scared? - Uh, yeah, I was, I was scared. I couldn't believe that it, you know, I always heard rumors and everybody's talking about, that they've seen it, you know, and, and when I actually looked up and saw him, he was just big and he was hairy and he made like this weird, like snorkeling kind of sound. I, I, I'd never heard it before. And then, when he turned around and looked, all I could see is his little brown eyes with like, right here is like, skin around his eyes. There was no hair right there, just skin, and he just looked back and made this little noise and then, I just looked away and I just closed my eyes and I was like, "Oh, don't come back, don't." I just don't believe in Bigfoot. Do you know how many new species are discovered every single year? Twenty thousand species every single year. Right. OK. And, what do you think that's including? Do you think that's including animals and creatures? That's plants, plankton, uh, microscopic organisms. - Oh, yeah. - Not what we're talking about. And, and I'm talking about mammals, too. Monkeys. All right? Do you know last year, they discovered a snub-nosed monkey? That's a brand new species they never even knew existed, - but they found it. - Yeah, but... And they never even found a body, dead or alive, but they found it. Not finding a tiny monkey in a giant rainforest the size of a continent is not the same as not finding a 900-pound hairy biped roaming around a very highly populated Pacific Northwest area. That's not the same, babe. So, you're a ranger? Seventeen years. Is that cool if we, if we mentioned that or...? Oh, I don't think it's important. - I, I wouldn't. - That's cool. Uh, so, um, I'm here with Troy Andrews and, uh, you know, he's willing to share with us, uh, uh, an incredible, uh, encounter. When did this happen? Oh, a couple of years ago. I was hunting in New Orleans. That's, uh, where Bluff Creek is? Yeah. Well, near there. Sorry. Just go on. Yeah. Yeah. So, I was out in, out in the woods with my, my dog, Bella, a beautiful girl. She was a golden retriever, and, uh, well, she, she took off in the woods and, uh, and I called, called for her to stop and, uh, she didn't, you know. She just kept going and, uh, which is weird, because usually, she's very obedient. And, uh, so I went in the woods after her. I was, I was calling and calling and, uh, nothing, you know. She, uh, I kept calling and, and, and then, I started to get a little nervous because the sun was going down, it was starting to get dark, and, uh, I kept calling and all of a sudden, I heard this, this, this, this, she was growling and whimpering and, uh, and then, she cut loose with this, with this horrible growl, wail kind of. It was, it was like a scream. When I got there, it was too late. She was dead. I loved that dog. You know, it hurt bad. Uh, someone or, or something had, uh, just ripped poor Bella in half, apart. Bigfoot? Well, I don't... I wouldn't say that. I mean, there's... There's a lot of people who live back in the, in these woods and, uh, they just don't like other people into their business here. Like who? Oh, like, uh, uh, pot farmers and, river people, locals, uh, I don't know, uh, pets and people go missing all the time here. Right. But you had mentioned to me earlier, um, when you were telling me this story that you had the feeling that, that it might have been something, a Bigfoot. Well, whoever or whatever it was, I don't know, you know. I just miss my dog. Thanks, Troy. - Is that it? - Yeah, that's it, man. That was a terrible story. I know. So, what do you think killed his dog? I don't know. It could have been anything. Yeah. He was lying. He knows what killed his dog. Are you serious? You don't believe that guy, but you believe any nut job out there that says Sasquatch is real? I don't know. I think we have to re-think this whole going into the woods thing. Oh, I'm not re-thinking anything. I'll go in there myself. You can just stay here in town, if you want. Can we at least have a normal discussion about this? Does it just... right away, it's got to be either/or? Listen. I'm not going to let one guy ruin our trip, all right? There's plenty of good people up here. Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum These are your friends. October 28, 1967, Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin Got 952 frames of truth And that's all the proof I need Bum, bum, bum, bum - Are you getting this? - Yeah. Somebody wants us to "leaf." Ah. So, so, we should go. Let's go. Bye, Bigfoot Motel. We're good? Yeah, you're good. Hey, what's up? I'm standing here with Bigfoot himself and, uh, Biggie, today is the day we hike into Bluff Creek to come look for you. How, how do you feel about that? - Uh-huh? - It's not a joke. OK. - You shouldn't go there. - Thank you. Have a nice day. Sorry. - Let's do it again. - OK. So, I'm here with Bigfoot and, uh, Biggie, today is the day we're going to come look for you. Are you cool with that? "Oh, yeah, me very cool." Good. Let's go get him. All right. This is so beautiful here. I know. We could move up here tomorrow and be fine with it. Hmm, I don't know about that. I don't think I could ever live here. Really? Why not? - What would I do? - I don't know. Be a farm hand? Yeah. I don't know. I'm sure there's some pretty good regional theater up here you could do. Yeah. I think I've done all the regional theater I care, uh, to do, honey. The Entire Works of Shakespeare by Kelley Monteleone. Yeah. The Trinity National Forest Art Center. No, I love that I've done all that, but, you know, I'd like to do some more stuff. I'd like to do TV and film and that's mostly in LA. I'm probably going to have to eventually be there. - What? LA? - Yeah. Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, OK. Because I could never move to LA. Fuck that. You know, if I moved to LA, I would still be the same person and so would you. I know you would be. I'm not saying, you, I'm talking about everybody else you have to live with down there. A bunch of freeholes. The last time I was there, babe, they put fruit in their, fruit in my sushi. Who does that? Is that... what did they call that? Frushi? They called it... Yeah, that's what... that's what I'm going to call it, frushi. I like that. That says everything you need to know about LA, to a T. Again, with the leprechauns? I'm recording. Trinity National Forest. Over 2 million acres of unexplored wilderness. There could be a whole herd of Bigfoot out here. Or, leprechauns. All right. First of all, leprechauns aren't real, okay? Bigfoot... Roger and Bob, they rode out that day I'm sorry. I love that song. No, you have a really good voice for that. Thank you. Nice... And I have no cell reception. The beginning of every horror movie. Are you getting excited? Yeah. I think we're getting close. I hope so because it's been a very long drive up a very narrow road. I realize I just turned on my turn signal. I don't think you need to worry about that here. I don't think I need it either. No. Let's see. Oh. - Someone's up there. - Who's this guy? Oh, better stop. Hey, how is it going, man? Hey, is this the final pass to get to the, uh, PGF film site? No, I'm sorry. It, it got washed out a long time ago. There's nothing down there anymore. Oh, yeah. No, I've heard about that, man, but, uh, I think we're going to check it out anyway. I think what you want to do is, you want to turn this around and go back the way you came and just keep driving until you get back to town. Uh, actually, man, I was told to come this way. We've been traveling all day, so... Could you turn that camera off, please? Oh, sorry. So, I think we're just going to move on now, man. Thank you. I've already tried being nice. Now, I'm telling you, turn this thing around, drive back the way you came, keep going until you hit town, maybe you can get there and get yourselves a couple of t-shirts and maybe have a nice slice of pie at the Fuck Off Cafe? - OK. So... - All right? OK. We got it. Why don't you get the fuck out of here? - Turn that fucking thing off. - OK. I'm sorry. Let's go, Jim. Come on. - Have a nice day. - OK... I'll just run this motherfucker over right now. - Uh... - Go on. Honey, let's just get out of here. Come on. This guy is obviously not excited with us being here. Did he just fucking throw a rock? What? He did? So, what are we going to do now? Well, I didn't come all this way to get turned around by that asshole. Lucky for me, I know another way in. I don't know if that's a good idea, Jim. Just hang in there, all right? Yeah? Can you do that? Yeah, I guess so. All right. Would you like me to narrate? Yeah. Oh. Hey, what's up? Uh, this is Kelly, just, uh, driving with my boyfriend. Um, I'm not sure where we are right now, but... We are in the Trinity National Forest. Ooh. Balls deep in the Trinity National Forest? Hellz, yeah. So, babe, we did it. This is, this is the actual road... To what? What do you think to what? To the Patterson-Gimlin film site. This is it. This is bonafide, so fuck you, hillbilly. I told you I know a way in. You sure did, babe, but we're really... What do you think about that? I think it's, um, scary, this road. Oh. I mean, we're driving in the day time. Yeah. Hmm. What did they, what did they ride in on, horses or something or...? Yeah, but this is how you get to the PGF site now. Hang on. Oh, oh. Bumpity, bumpity. Last stop for the car. Ah. We got to hike the rest of the way in. But babe, this is it. We're going to get there. Yes, we are. Can we get out of the car now? I would love that. Let's do it. We're here. We're here. We're leaving the car behind - and this is it, babe. - This is it. This is the road that leads to Bluff Creek. Ooh. To the famed Patterson-Gimlin film site. Whoa. What do you think? - I didn't... - Holy shit. I don't think I pictured it like this. This is awesome. Babe, this is the dream I've had since I was eight years old. - I know. - Thank you. I'm happy to be here, honey. Come on. Let's go. Yup. Ooo, is there a Starbucks on the way? How long did you say it takes? Mmm, air is clean. - And, another brilliant observation, honey. - Shut up. Check out that moss. Whoa. Ah, sweet. Poop! Whoa. Oh, look at all that. That could be Bigfoot scat. Yeah, or it could be bear shit. Or, Pope shit. OK. Ahh. It's prickly. Ouch! Here, babe. Grab the camera. - Get some of me walking through. - Sure. Why not? I'd love to. I like nature. - Oh. - Aw! Yeah. Are you all right? - Yes. - Yeah? - All right. Just watch yourself. - Oh, right in the nose. Oh, shit. Ooh. Are you getting this? Oh, yeah, I'm getting it. All right. "Are you getting this, huh?" Watch your step here. Yeah, I'm trying to, to film and walk at the same time in a treacherous area. Bear with me. Not even a path. What the fuck? How do we know we're going in the right direction? Just keep going, babe. We're almost there. This is fucking ridiculous. Ah. Ooh. So, by my estimations, we're about an hour to an hour and a half from the PGF film site. Turn off the camera. - What? - Turn off the... So, we decided to set up camp here. Check this out. Jim? - Hold on, let me just get this. - I need you to... It's amazing to think that we're in the same woods that Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin were in 45 years ago when they saw that creature. What do you think? It's very pretty. Babe. Hey, babe, come here. What? Come here. I want to show you something. Come here. I got a little surprise for you. Really? Yeah, really. OK. Bring it over here. No, no, no. Come on. Follow me. Oh my God. Told you. Wow. This is insane. You did good. All right, I'm going in. - You are? - Yeah. Oh my God. OK. So hot. Yeah. Whoa! Oh my God. Whoa! Oh! It's cold. Yeah? Baby, I am proud of you. How cold do you think that is? Should I get in there? No. Whoa. I like that you had no hesitation jumping in that water even though I didn't get in. What is my sock doing in the tree? Oh, what sock? Huh. That's weird. Oh my God. What the fuck? Honey, I want to go home. I wouldn't worry about it. It's probably just a bear. Just a bear!? Oh, great. That makes me feel good. All right. Well, just help me put it back up. Look, they're more afraid of us than we are of them. I don't know. I'm pretty afraid of them. Actually, just stand there and record. I think that'll be, that'll be much better. Oh. Oh, are you telling me you don't want me to film? Uh, yeah? What is it? What is it? I don't know, but it sounded really big. What? It was right behind me. I think it moved over there. Are you serious? Can you see it? No, I don't see anything. I just heard it. Huh? Ahh. Oh. Did you see that? Yeah. - Wow. - It freaked me out so much. Yeah. Me, too. - I think we found our visitor. - Oh my God, yeah. He did have big feet. Ah. Come in. OK, back in the tent. What? Nothing. It's not going to be that kind of night. I hope you know. You know, you dragged me all the way out here. So, listen. You know I love you, right? Yes. - And, I've never felt... - I love you. I've never felt this way about anyone. Ever. And, uh... Well. Kelly, will you marry me? Oh, I don't know what to say. Um... Well, you could start by saying, "Yes." Look, I really care about you. I do. I, I really do. I just, I think it might be too soon. Wow. What if we move in together? I've been thinking about it a lot and I really, I want to be with you. I do. Move in, in LA? If you'd be willing to do that. Yeah, I would. You would? Yeah, Kelly, come on. All right, I guess I'll take that. You'll take that? For now. I love you. Are you going to turn that off? I don't know. It might be good for your career. Oh, really? Do you want me to have that kind of career? - Hmm. - Yeah? - OK. - I guess I could turn it off. Yes. Beep. - OK. - Yeah, nice try. Really turn it off now. Baby, come on. Did you hear that? Hear what? Why are you putting the camera with the light on. I heard knocking. What's knocking? Knocking. I don't hear anything, honey. I'm going to go try to get some sleep... and you should, too. Come on. - Just lie down. - All right. - Honey, come on. It's nothing. - I know. I will, I will. It's probably, you know, an animal or something. Just go back to bed. - No, you come with me. Come on. - I will. I will. I'm coming. - Did you hear that? - Yes, I heard that. What are you going to do with that? I'm trying to see if I can see something. - In case... - No, turn that off. I'm cold. That was knocking. I don't know what that means. Sasquatches, they, they are known for knocking pieces of wood together. It's a way to communicate. That could be, you know, trees falling or something, - or maybe... - Are you serious? It can be a bear, you know. - A bear? - There's animals... Grabbing a piece of wood and hitting it against another piece of wood? Bears can break into cars, babe, they can do anything. Did you leave food out? No. It's not anything, babe. Just tell me. You're just trying to make me scared. - Maybe... - I'm wondering if I should go... What? Oh, that guy, remember, down in town, who said, "Don't go right there." That's probably him fucking with us. It's possible. Crazy people over here. Oh, I'd be more than happy to fuck with him. I'm sorry. That sounded like... Like what? A vocalization. A vocalization? - Yeah. - Of what? - Sasquatch. - Of a person? A person can make that sound? Shh, shh. What if we turn off the light? Do you think that would be good? Whatever it is will go away. I don't want it to go away. - Honey, I do. - This is good. I don't want something fucking with us out there. This is, I knew this is... People don't want us to come out here, so people are probably fucking with us. I don't know. Yeah, right, yeah, whatever, completely. - It's fucking cold. I know that much. - I know. Put your arm around me. I'm cold. Did you see something? Does your cell phone work here? No. That one was closer. It sounded like it was in another area. Maybe there's more than one. What? Come on. Can wolves make that kind of sound? - I mean, it was... - Are you fucking serious? I'm trying to figure out what, what this is. Do I need to tell you what this is? Honey, we're in a huge forest. There's like a ton of things that could be out there. You still don't believe, huh? You know, I'd much rather be in my own bed right now, so... This is... I knew we were asking for trouble coming here. This is not good. - Just, just... shh, shut up. - People get pissed... We're going into territory that should not be messed with. I think whatever it is, it's gone away, babe. You know, whatever it is, maybe, whatever it is, is just warning us to get away and... it sounds like they're gone now. What? OK, babe. It's gone, babe. That ain't no human. What's that supposed to mean? What is that sound? Maybe we should turn off the light, babe. What is that? That sounds like someone's crying. Is that a woman? I don't know what the fuck that is. This is not funny anymore. I'm freaked out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, yeah. What if somebody needs our help? It sounded like a woman who's in pain. Shh, shh, shh. I'm not fucking going out there. I'm not going to go. I really think we're attracting attention having the light on us in here. You want me to turn it, the light off? Maybe turn it off for a second. I'm going to keep recording? That's fine. But maybe just turn off the light. Maybe, whatever. It's attracted to the light. There's something... - Turn it back on? - Yeah. That was really close. What the fuck is that? Someone is right out there. Jim. - Babe, what was that? - I don't know, I don't know. It's going away. What the fuck. Fuck. So, it's almost dawn and we're getting the hell out of here. We had some fucked up shit go down last night, um, all kinds of vocalizations, uh, we had rocks thrown at us, wood knocking, uh, something pushed on our tent and, uh, needless to say, we're getting the fuck out of dodge. We're not going to go to the film site. - OK? - Yeah. - Are you ready? - I'm fucking ready. - I'm not taking the camera. - Take the fucking camera. Seriously. Please. Look at this. Did you see this? What the fuck is that? Some kind of hair or something. That's great, Jim. You know what? Great. But we got to keep moving. What are you doing? I'm getting it. You don't think we got enough last night? Come on. Let's go. Oh my God. - Fuck. - Come on, Jim. - All right, all right. - Are you serious? Let's go. - Please just shoot this. - I am shooting this. Good. - Oh. - Oh. OK. We got it. Let's go. All right, all right. Just chill. Jim, we got to start moving again. I'm going. - Come on. - I'm going, I'm going. Fuck. - Are you all right? - Where are we going from here? Yeah. I just want to know what direction we're going in. Here, give me the camera. This way? So, I may have just gotten some evidence. Jim, are you seriously filming yourself? Let's go. You're leading. So, we're hearing some crazy shit. - More vocalizations. - Jim, are you fucking kidding me? OK. I knew this wasn't right. I knew it. Why are you stopping? What? - It's the same tree. - What? That is the tree that we just passed by three hours ago. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is, Jim. It's the same fucking tree. What are you talking about? This is where you found the fucking hair. We stopped. That's not the same tree. Yes, I have it in the fucking film. We have it, Jim. - Babe, I don't think that's it. - You don't think that's it? Why don't you look at your footage? Your fucking footage that you brought me out here for. That's not it. Look, you're overreacting, all right? I'm overreacting? Are you serious? We should have been back by now. What... - Fuck! - It's getting dark out. What are we going to do? Come on, Kel, let's go! I'm not following you anymore. Oh my God! Are you all right? What the fuck was that? Come on, babe. Are you all right? Kelly? Are you all right? - Come on, babe, let's just go. - We don't know where we are. I know, but we got to go. I want to go home. I do too. Baby, we got to go. Where are we going to go? I don't know where we are. No! No! No! All right. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, Kel! Oh my God! No, no! Kelly! Come here! Holy shit. What is it? Oh, shit. - Come on! - Oh my God! Go! Run! Shit. Holy shit. Where'd it go? Oh, shit. Oh, fuck, it's back. I fucked up. What the fuck is it? Let's keep moving. - No. - No, come on. Fuck. No! Jim! No! No! No! Help me! Help me!
