 

                        [eerie instrumental music]  [labored breathing] [clicking noise] - Listen. Listen. Do you hear it? Go away. You all have to go away. [gasping breaths] [strange scraping noises] No! [footsteps pounding] [locks clicking] It's not in my head. Bobby. Bobby, where are you? Bobby. Bobby, why aren't you here? It's happening again. Shh, shh. [whimpering] They're after me. I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. You hear them, don't you? [labored breathing] No. No! [sobbing and screaming] [pounding noises] [gagging] [keys jangling] buzz! [mechanical whirring] - Well, they're hiring non-unions down at sanitation, if you're interested. - There's nothing in transportation? - Not at the moment. Do you have any other job skills? - Good mechanic. - Got a lot of mechanics waiting for work already. All right, now what time will l expect you to call me tonight? - About what? - Well, it says here you got a board release. Do you understand what that means? - I've never done this before. - It means parole on a short leash. So you call in the next 24 hours and let me know where you're parking yourself tonight. - I'm staying at my mother's. - All right. You come in every Tuesday for the next six months. Now, this is important, because you miss one, you're in violation. Does your mother know you're staying with her? - No. - Well, don't you think you should call and tell her? - She died while I was inside. - I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any other family? Call him in the morning. He may have work. Not a lot of employers want to hire people in your situation. [horn honking] [men talking indistinctly] buzz! - Need something? - Helen Reynolds' son. I left you that message. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course, 519. Wait here. - I don't know where I'm going. - Elevator to five. Had to go in to change the locks, you know? - How come? - Well, the police had to break the door open, you know, when they found her. I didn't charge you for it, though. - Thanks. - [muttering in Russian] - Going up? - [muttering in Russian] [door creaks] [metal scrapes] [high-pitched discordant piano music]  [sighs] [muffled voices]  - [sighs] [sweet piano music]  [thumping and scraping] Ow! Damn it. - What do you mean, what do I mean? Where were you? - I was just here inside the house. - You were just here inside of the house. Now, how come I saw you out by that door? What are you doing at that door? You weren't there? What, am I seeing things? - I really don't understand. What happened here? [mumbling] [door slams] Oh, there's another story again. - No, it's not a story. She wanted to play. - She can play inside the apartment. Why do you have to play with her out in the hallway? [record skips] [muffled voices] [people chattering] - I'll be right with you. - What do you guys want? - Tell me what's good here. - Listen. Hey. - Can you excuse me? Hi. When did you get back? - A couple days. - Are you here for good? - I hope so. - I'm sorry about your mom. I heard what happened. - Yeah, it's... You look great. - No, no, I don't. You don't have to say that. - Maybe a cup of coffee or something later? - I can't. I have finals. - School? You're going to school? - Yep. - That's amazing. - I have to design an entire line by next week. It's... everything's really different for me now. - Yeah, maybe another time. Maybe this weekend, maybe- - I'm working doubles and school, and, look, I have zero free time. I don't think it's a good idea. - Can we get the bill, please? - [sighs] I'm sorry. I have to get back to work. - It's good to see you. - You too. [scraping noises] [person moaning] [louder moaning] [gasping] [clattering noise] - Help. - Mom. - Help me. [heavy breathing] [men talking indistinctly] - See anything wrong? - Got to be a loose brake pad spring. - You're sure about that? - Guy complained of a rattle when he drives over bumps, right? - That's right. You know how to check for misfires in alignment pressure? - Yeah. - Look, I've got to be honest with you. Involuntary manslaughter, that's not exactly a minor offense, you know? - If I had more to offer you than my word, I would give it to you, man. But I'm just trying to put my life back together. - Pay ain't high. - I don't need much. - If I hire you, I just ask you to be straight with me. All right? It took me a long time to build this shop, and I don't want anything risking that. You understand? - Give me one week, and I'll show you what I can do. - Come back tomorrow. - Thank you. - All right. Sir, get up. buzz! - It's suppertime. He won't answer. - Got some plumbing problems, I think. Like, I'm hearing noises in the walls. - Patrol and unit 25. [indistinct] - [woman speaks indistinctly] - We get calls. This is a code four on First and Broadway. - Code two. Get 6544. [indistinct voices over radio] - [sighs] Great. [cheers and applause on TV] Miss Trupiano? Bobby Reynolds. Yeah. Yeah, from high school. Uh, yeah, I was released. Is Louis there? Oh, yeah? You got a forwarding number maybe or- Hello? Hello? - She's got the dirty mouth from the South. All the way from Pascagoula, Mississippi, it's Molly Ritter. [cheers and applause] [dull scraping] [dull scraping] [muffled scraping] [high-pitched piano tone] [lid creaks] [high-pitched piano tone] You handle all the apartments in the building, man? Who's been in mine? - You have the only key. Everything okay? - I found these. - They're fingernails. - I know what they are, man. Why-why are they in my place? Who would keep 'em? - Maybe they belong to your mother? - Why would she keep 'em? - When did you speak to her last? - Couple of years. Yeah, you shouldn't have to hear this from me, but the neighbors heard from the police. Your mother locked herself in her apartment for weeks before she died. - What? You got any idea why she would do that? - No idea. I started work here after. I never met her. But when they found her, she was in real bad shape. You never knew about this? Nobody check in on her? - She didn't have anybody else, man. Maybe one of the neighbors upstairs knows more. - Well, no offense, son, but nobody here wants to talk to you. Everybody knows you were in prison. People talk. She was sick, real sick. - Yeah. You-you gonna check on those noises? - What noises? - In the walls. Rusty pipes, I don't know. They're coming from somewhere, man. Well, this is a prewar building. You know, walls are thick. There's vents running through the ceiling. There's no sound. You seem to be the only one hearing things. - I wasn't there. - You weren't there? What am l- am I seeing things? - l-I don't know what you're talking about. - Why do you keep lying to me all the time? - I'm not lying to you. What, I go to work all day. I come home and what? - No, just just stop. - Who is this guy? - Stop. Stop it. Please. - Well, you're acting like I'm- what, like-what am l? Am I the bad guy here? You're the one that's out- - No, no, no, no, I didn't say that. I didn't say it. - Well, what the hell were you doing there? - I wasn't doing anything. - I don't want to catch you by that door again. - Are you all right in there? [power tools whining] - All right, we'll start you off with tune-ups. We'll see how fast you work. You're also going to bring the cars in and park them behind the gate every night. It's freshman work, but you're the new guy. You show me you got skills, I'll give you more shifts and bigger jobs. - You hear that? - What? - Like a voice. - It's a valve grinder. Car keys are in there. [woman whimpering] - What is that? - That's the drop-box. Don't give keys out till the customer's paid in full. You got it? Had a lot of cars jacked from this shop. Can't risk that kind of nonsense anymore. [woman crying] Yo! You with me? - Yeah. Yeah. - Good. Get to work. - Two sugars, no milk. - I switched to Sweet'N Low. - Are you gonna knock it, or you gonna drink it? - You call anyone from the neighborhood yet? - Yeah, I called around. Seems like everybody moved away. - Hmm. People grew up. - Things ain't what they used to be, right? - Did you think everything would be the same? - I was hoping some things would be. - Bobby- - I know you got questions. - No, no, I don't have questions. I had questions, had questions for the past few years. I stopped asking them when you stopped writing. I didn't know if you were alive or coming back. Why on Earth would you just cut me off? - I thought I was doing it for you. - For me? - Nothing that happened in there was anything that we could have talked about. - So what did you think was going to happen here? You show up out of thin air, bring me coffee, and I forgive you? - You don't think people deserve a second chance? - Bobby. - You want to come by the apartment some time? - Maybe. - I'll take maybe. - Maybe. I got to go. - Can I help you? - No. - What are you doing? - Are they coming from you? The sounds, is that you? Maybe the woman? - What did you say? - [stammering] There's a woman who lives here. I've seen her at your- - You don't know anything about who lives here, man. - You hear them. Don't you? [locks clicking] [water trickling] [muffled clattering] [muffled scraping] - Ah! [distant creaking noises] [hatch slams open] [wind howling] - What? Am I the bad guy here? - No, no, no, no, I didn't say that. I didn't say it. - Well, what the hell are you doing there? - I wasn't doing anything. - I don't want to catch you by that door again. Do you understand? Understand? Do you understand me? Do you understand? - You're hurting me! [smacking] [woman screaming] - There you go! Don't you ever do that- [door slams] [footsteps approaching] [distant clanging] [door creaking] [woman coughing] - Oh. [coughing] Ew. [sniffles] [coughing] [crashing] [whirring] - Listen. Shh, shh. Do you hear it? [labored breathing] [gasping] No, no. It's not in my head. Bobby. Bobby, where are you? Bobby. Bobby, why aren't you here? Oh, it's happening again. Shh, shh. They're after me. I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. You hear them, don't you? [tape whirring] You hear them, don't you? Oh, no. No! [screaming] [knocking at door] [screaming] [gasping] [gagging] [pounding on door] - [muttering in Russian] - Going to the lobby? - [muttering in Russian] [door clicks] [distant footsteps] Hello? [woman whimpers] [machine starts and rattles] [woman screams in distance] [door creaks] [girl crying in distance] - [muttering in Russian] [high-pitched discordant piano music]  [knocking at door] - Do you know if he's in there? Hello? Bobby? Your door's open. Hello? [door slams open] - You came. How'd you get in? - Your door was open. - You okay? - Yeah. Who-who lives in that apartment? - Nosy neighbors. I guess they don't feel too comfortable with an ex-con in the building. - Wow. - Yeah, it's hers. All this- all this is hers. I don't know what to do with it. Well, it's kind of... - Vintage? - Ugly. - [laughs] - Do you like it here? - Getting used to it. Everybody here seems a little off. - Well, it's the East Village. She looks happy. - I don't think she was. She was on medication. It got so bad that, uh, uh, she stayed here at the apartment for weeks and didn't leave until eventually she starved to death. I don't know if it was suicide. Nobody does. I can't even go in her bedroom. It sounds crazy, but l- I feel sometimes like she's still here. - Bobby, it's gonna take time to heal. - These are amazing. - They're just rough sketches. What? - Do you ever wonder what would have happened if I didn't go away? - Sometimes. Do you? - Every day. - What was it like? - lsolating. But at the same time, you never have any privacy. You just hang onto the stuff you had, you know, before, the- the good things. - It's late. I should go. - Yeah. It's good to see you. - You too. - Please, somebody help us! [sobbing] - Hang on. [knocking at door] You okay? Miss? [knocking at door] Miss? You need some help with something? Whatever it is, I'm right next door if you need anything. [pounding on door] You need something? - I want you to mind your own business, okay? Huh? [locks clicking] - Please open the door. [knocking at door] [whimpering] - These measurements aren't right. - Are you sure? - Yeah, look at this. Senior collection's going up Friday, and you haven't even sewn yet. - I went to see Bobby. I saw a woman standing at his door. She was crying. I don't know. I-I suppose he doesn't owe me an explanation or anything. - You still have feelings for him. - I don't know. Maybe. What if I do? What am I supposed to do about it? I don't know what I'm supposed to do. [knocking at door] - Somebody help us! [pounding on door] - Come here! Come here! Get in here. - Let Carly go. Run, baby, run! Look at me. - Carly. Carly! - Do what you have to do to me! [smacking] [screaming] - Where are you going? - Fuck this. - You weren't there? What, am l- am I seeing things? - You okay? - Why do you keep lying to me all the time? What, I go to work all day. I come home and- - Here, come in. It's okay. Come on. What's your name? - Am I the bad guy here? You're the one that's out- - No, no, no, I didn't say that. I didn't say that. - My name is Bobby. I know you probably don't want to talk to strangers, right? But if you tell me what's going on in there, I might be able to help you. You want to tell me? You play the piano? - Hey! Listen to me. Where were you? - Here, inside the house. - You were just here inside of the house? So how-how come I saw you out by that door? What were you doing at that door? - Hey, you want to play a real piano? - You weren't there? - Come on. Why don't we make some music on a real piano? [door slams] I remember when I couldn't even reach the pedals, but I bet you can. Stay right there. One second. [man shouting] [random piano tones] smack! - What are you doing? Don't you dare try to do that again! [quiet piano tones]  [woman and man shouting] [woman crying] - This is crazy. [woman whimpers] Stay right there. He's never going to hurt you or your mother again. All right? - Don't you dare do that! Why do you keep lying to me all the time? [man shouting] [phone trilling] You weren't there? Where were you? - No, I didn't say that. - Well, what the hell were you doing there? [crashing] - 911. What's your emergency? - Yeah, I'm-I'm at 20 Avenue E, apartment 519. The guy next door is beating on his wife. - Do you understand? - Can you repeat the location, please? - 20 Avenue E. - When I tell you to stay in, you stay in! - Sir, is anyone hurt? - Yeah, I don't know. Well, just send- you can't just send somebody? - Sir, I need to confirm if someone's hurt. [door slams] [pounding on the door] Hey! I can hear you in there. [pounding on door] - [crying] - Hug me once, okay? - Open the goddamn door! - Domestic officers arrived. - 1026? - Yeah, right down here. - You know the tenants? - No. They fight a lot. It got pretty bad tonight. - You see anything? No, but there's a- there's a little girl, and I didn't want to take chances. The guy is a cop. - Please stand back, sir. [knocking at door] NYPD. Anybody inside in need of assistance? [knocking at door] Open up! - Roger that. [door creaks] What is this, a joke? - Where are they? - Are you sure this is the apartment? - Yeah. Yeah. I-I just heard them. - It doesn't look like anyone's lived here in a very long time. You been drinking tonight? - No. No! The daughter was just at my apartment. - What's her name? - l-I don't know. And the wife, the one that was beaten, do you know her name? - She never told me. - Most people know a lot more about their imaginary friends than that, pal. You got yourself one hell of a vivid imagination. - 10-4. - They were just here! - Look, you know what? Next time, just don't call us. Let's go. Wasting my time, man. [knocking at door] - Yeah? - Who lives in the apartment next to mine? - Why? - Because I just called the cops on them, and they showed up, and there was nobody there. So what the hell is going on? - You called the police on who? - On the guy in the apartment next to mine. He's a cop. - Look, I don't know what you're talking about. That apartment's been empty ever since I started working here. - Yeah-no. There's-there's a girl. There's a kid and her mom, and the dad is abusing them all day long. Everybody in the place can hear it. - Yeah, not everyone. - I've- I've seen them. Look, I've walked each and every hall in this building. I know every tenant that lives here. I've never seen a girl or a family in 517. Just you and that guy in 512 live there. Now, let me sleep. [door slams] [locks clicking] [melancholy piano music]  [muffled rock music]  - What? - You're killing me. - Sorry. [girl crying] We still have two more chapters. - I got to go. - What? Why? Wait. [people chattering] Are you okay? - It was my fault. - What was? - Bobby went to jail because of me. - What do you mean? We were at that bar on Rivington. Some guy followed me into the bathroom. He pushed me up against the wall, and put his hand over my mouth. - What? - Next thing I know, Bobby, he hit him so hard that I heard the bones in his face crack. And he didn't stop. The more I cried, the more Bobby hit him. - Al, he killed someone. - I don't know what to do. I mean, he did all that time. - Maybe he'll hurt you some day. - It's-it's not him. It never was. He was only trying to help. - I just want you to be careful, okay? - Yeah. [tool whirring] - [exhales hard] [footsteps pattering] [loud grinding] [panting] - What the hell's your problem, man? - [heavy breathing] - You all right, bro? - Uh, I got blood coming out of my ears. - How the hell did you do that, man? - I don't know. - Go see a doctor. - I got to finish my shift, man. - Go see a doctor. Blood coming out of your ears ain't normal. Are you sick or something? You doing okay? - How do you mean? - I'm not gonna pretend like I know you, but you been falling apart since you took this job. - Um, if I try to explain it, it's not gonna sound right. - When I came out of recovery, I started over too. I had a sponsor to talk to when things got out of hand. You know what I'm saying? You need someone to talk to, or you're gonna fall apart. Go home. I'll lock up. - All right. [horns honking] I'm leaving the city. I can't stay here. - Why? - I think whatever's- whatever happened to my mother is happening to me. And l-I just- I just got to make it stop. - What? What? - I'm hear-I'm hearing sounds, and I am seeing people who aren't there. - Bobby, your mother was sick. - She wasn't crazy. Something made her crazy. - Maybe you leaving did make her depressed. You deserted her, Iike you deserted a lot of people in your life. - You got tables. - I got to go. [old-fashioned music]  [girl whimpering] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [screaming] [knocking at door] - Open the door. Open the door, please! I know you're in there! [screeching] - [screams] [cries out] [grunts] - [screaming] - [panting] [crashing] - What do you want? - What do you want? [knocking at door] - Good morning, sir. - Yeah. - Do you know a Joseph Wright? He lives down the hall from you. - I just moved in. - Heard anything out of the ordinary? Seen anyone suspicious? - No. - The neighbors told us you just got out of Rikers. Is that true? - What's this about? - Were you home all evening? - No, I was with a friend. - I may be back with more questions. [door slams] - No, no. - You didn't see anything? - Rick, you want to give me a hand with this? - Yo, Bobby! You're an hour late. - Sorry, man, there's something going on in my building today. - We need to talk. - Yeah. - You come by the shop last night? - No. - You sure you didn't come by the shop last night after closing? - Yeah. - There was a 300 that came in for a tire balance. You remember it? - It wasn't mine. I didn't do a balance yesterday. - It's gone. I came in this morning, it was off the lot. I called up the owner, she hasn't picked it up yet. - You got something you want to ask me, man? - Look, my other guys have been with me for years, Bobby. All I got on you is your history. But I have a situation with no other answer. If that 300 gets returned in the next hour, I won't call the cops. - I don't have the car, man. - No, I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here. - Call the cops, man. I don't have the car. - I can't keep you on until that 300 turns up. - Yeah. All right. [wind rushing] [crashing] - Hello? [footsteps running] Hello? [girl whimpering] - Yo, what's this? How the hell did this happen? Damn, man! Watch the shop. - [gasping] [distant whispering] [breathing heavily] [door creaking] [screaming] - Are you okay? - Alyssa Foldes? Alyssa Foldes. Anybody- nobody knows her? Alyssa Foldes? You know Alyssa? It's really important that I talk to her. - Sorry. I don't know where she is. - Come on. You got to help me out. - She put a lot of trust in you. And you're going to end up hurting her again. She can't deal with that in her life right now. - You don't know what's going on. - I know Alyssa never showed up tonight. I know she didn't turn in her final. And I know she's only been acting like this since you showed up. Just leave her alone. She knows about the other girl. - What other girl? - The woman at your apartment. - Did-did Alyssa talk to her? - Don't know. - Just have her call me. [knocking at door] - Bobby, you there? It's Hector. The city towed the wrong car, man. I'm sorry I doubted you. You still have your job if you want it, man. [knocking at door] Bobby! Are you all right, kid? Hello? Little girl? You all right? Hello? Where are you? Hello? Little girl? [gasps] Help! Help! Anybody? Help! [phone beeping] Damn it! [panting] [choking] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Mr. Reynolds, do you know what day it is today? - No. What? - It's your weekly check-in. Appointments with your PO are not optional. I thought we understood each other. - Yeah. Sorry. - Is there something I should know? Mr. Reynolds? - I can't talk right now. - Look, let me give this to you in vivid detail. You speed your way into the parole office right now, or you illegally violate, and we come looking for you. You get me? Mr. Reynolds? - Help-help me! I know you're in there! Please! Please open the door! [strange scraping noises] [people chattering] - Bobby? Bobby, can you hear me? Look, um, those- those noises that you heard, I think- I think I may be hearing them too. I don't understand what's happening. You were trying to tell me something, and I didn't listen, and I'm sorry. And I'm going to come and find you, okay? [knocking at door] - Open the door! - Bobby? - Think I don't know you're in there? - I don't want trouble. - You've been watching me. I see you in the window. What are you looking at? Something happened on that floor. You know something, don't you? - There was this family living there. One night, the mother, she kept screaming. - No. Don't! - But nobody helped her. - It doesn't make sense. You could-you could have just called the cops. - A lot of terrible things happen in this city every day. - Either we assumed someone would call the police, or we were afraid to, or worse. [woman screaming] Some of us just didn't care. The next morning, they were all dead. [gunshot] - It's your fault. You could have done something. You let them die. Any one of you, my mother included, could have saved them. You realize that? [locks clicking] Hey, hey, hey! Wait! - I'm sorry. I can't help you. - Why-why won't they stop? [knocking at door] - Hello, Miss? Is he in there? I really need to find him. [knocking at door] Anyone home? Sorry, l- the woman who walked in here, do you... [door slams] [locks click] [locks clicking] [gasps] [door slams] [panting] [screaming] [moaning] [screams] [coughing] [screams] [whimpering] [Alyssa crying] [crying] - Oh, my God! Alyssa? Alyssa! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. What did they do to you? [phone trilling] Oh, God. Oh, God. Please. - 91 1. What is your emergency? I-I need an ambulance. Please. - What is your current location? [high-pitched discordant piano music] Sir? Can you hear me?  Sir? - You're doing real good, honey. Everything's going to be okay. But I want you to be strong for mommy. You got me? Right. Let me see that pretty smile. There. - Hey, what are you doing? - Please don't do this. - Don't do what? - We're leaving. - Why are you leaving? - You know why. - But you... - Don't! - You can't leave. Whoa, whoa. What? Don't what? What? [gasps] Shh, it's okay. It's okay. - Where are you? - Here, here, here, here, here, here. - [crying] - Listen, listen. - You just close your eyes and go to that special place like always. Nothing else will matter. - Carly, are you okay? Why are you crying? What- - No. - l-I really don't understand what's happening here. What-what- Why do you want to leave me? [crying] - Why? - Hmm? - Look at me. You did- you did this to me. - I didn't do that. Who the hell did that to you? - [crying] Go! Run, baby, run! Look at me! Just let Carly go, please. - Uh, Carly... - Do what you have to do to me! - Carly. I don't understand what's happening here. - Walter. - It's fricking making me- It makes me so mad! - [crying] - It's making me lose my freakin' mind, you know. [breathing heavily] - Why won't you just let us go, please? Please. - Baby. I love you so much. Just say it for me once okay? Just tell me that you love me. Just once. Just say it. Just say that you- - No, no! Somebody help us! Please, someone help us! Open this door! Come on. Please. No, don't, please. No, no. [scraping noises] Please, somebody help us! Come on and help me! Open the door! Somebody help us, please! No, Walter, no! No! No! - [crying] - [panting] - [whimpering] - [crying] - [crying] - Walter, no! - Stop! You got to stop. - You mind your own business. Agh! - [screams] - Agh! [wet thudding] - No! - [screaming] - [panting] - [screaming] - [coughing] - [sighs] - [crying] - Alyssa! - [whimpering] - Alyssa? - [crying] - Oh, it's okay. It's okay. [sirens wailing] [high-pitched discordant piano music]
