It felt as if the floor was moving ... But I but I didn't fall. I wanted to vomit in the bathroom, but couldn't move. I heard nothing anymore. That was weird, even though his home was a farm in the countryside. How long lasted that feeling? I don't know. Maybe ten minutes ... Maybe just one ... Hey, Pam, what are you telling me? But I don't know. I don't know. My legs stopped shaking, I ran into the bathroom. It's next to the kitchen. I took the knife that lay on the table, and ran into the bathroom. I wanted to stab me in the stomach, he jumped at me to take it away. So I stabbed him. You stabbed him? I didn't want to harm him. I just wanted to wound his shoulder. But I was clumsy. I'm right handed and I couldn't use my right hand. He pushed me ... I couldn't see much. Wait! You said you couldn't hear and now you're blind too! But it's true! The bathroom was very small. Like a closet. I didn't want to harm him ... I would have taken care of him. I'd have looked after him so well, that he'd never let me down. Next. Everything happened fast. A few drops of blood fell into the sink. He fell down in front of the door. Oh no, those are his clothes! - Leave it, leave it! - Those are his clothes. That's my fault. Leave it! Stop it! Pam! Stop it! Five years earlier Pam ... Come on. We've no time. Don't forget we'll leave without paying. Very good, sir. For tonight and tomorrow. Very good, sir. Goodbye. How are you today? Stay a little longer? My contract is extended by one week. Be strong. Sleep well. That was easy! A children's game. You made me afraid. Why did you take the swan? Because we need it most. What would I do without you? If you knew how much I love you. Hey, the swan! Thank you, darling. Take of your glasses. I want to see your eyes. I want to go to Mojacar with you. It doesn't look great yet, but tonight everything will be full. I thought it was a theater. Don't worry. They are building the stage. What are you doing? Our local production, madam. Self made. Tonight, after the screening, there'll be a big aphrodisiac meal. Don't worry, our audience is very tolerant. And don't worry the technical part, we've got everything. Look at this. You'll understand. We try to show eroticism in a natural way. So you eventually don't connect eroticism with this damn stuff, with whips, leather and ice ax using psychopaths. You understand? There. Excuse me. A young admirer wants to see you. What do you want, an autograph? No, I want a kiss. Oh, my stone. What are you doing, honey? Now I know why the bag was so heavy. We said, the clothes and the dictionary... My toys! We said we'd get them when we had more money. Have you betrayed me? What can I do without my book? Mom, where are you going? I'll be right back, honey. Why doesn't the dictionary say that the god Jupiter ... transformed himself into a swan in order to rape Leda? Since I'm 15, men fall in love with me and I don't understand why. They appear in my life, swear that they worship me, that I'll never be alone again, and then ... suddenly ... one day ... they're gone. I could die, I could roll on the ground, they wouldn't care. Do you understand that? I think so. These guys didn't see you. They fell in love with an image, with a fantasy. That's normal, with this show ... And you? Do you see "my real me"? It's a great success. It's in all the newspapers. Look, you are very beautiful. I didn't expect that. Make no mistake in your fate! What' s this? I'm sorry. Your cheque... intersected with a payment ... Do you have a traffic jam on your account? I'll explain. The transfer I expected, was a little delayed. - You've cashed your cheque immediately ... - Listen, Bruno. Keep your tricks for you. Don't get nervous! Give me a week, it will be arranged. And meanwhile we'll camp in the Bois de Vincennes? Your hotel can wait a week, right? My hotel isn't the Salvation Army. They want their money and me too! Trust me, you'll get your money. Listen, Bruno. The people from Alcudia have already paid you. They have transferred the money. So where's my money? What are you doing? Are you crazy? What are you doing? Caution, Hot! Elsa. Lily, my darling! I was looking for you, but you left no address as usual. Hey, I must tell you ... Want a drink? Come on. Imagine they offered me a role in a TV series. If it's a success, more to come. And your work here? I'll quit. I want to be an actress, not a waitress. Can you imagine, how much money we're talking about? Impossible to say no. The problem is, I've to play a female cop. Wow, the whole world will be dreaming of you. What do you think of the drummer? The drummer? I prefer the one at the keyboard. Looks great! Seriously. I need a new drummer, mine goes on tour. I can introduce you. Lily, this is Luis Varona. Luis, Lily. We know each other, right? If Luis Varona says it, then ... All right. Bye. On the magic! The magic of encounter? It's too easy. What do you believe then? I believe... I believe, that... I may not waste a minute in life! What's your real name? Does it matter? Lily... You've given it yourself. You aren't born with that name. I was born like everyone else, Mr: Shivering, naked and alone! It's okay. I don't push you. If you don't want to tell me... Tell me, Luis ... You aren't interested in half-truths? What difference does it make if my parents called me Leila? Leila, do you know what that means? Leila is the night. But the truth the only truth that counts, is that I get out of the night, to meet the light. Careful, don't burn your wings! This is so good. No, Luis. I don't want. The little girl sleeps right here. Later. I don't want. Look, she's awake. How is Luis? They're on tour. Shouldn't they be back already? Maybe they had more concerts, or ... Strange, he called me all the time, sometimes two or three times a day, and now, suddenly, since a week, total silence. He seemed very much in love, right? - Yes. - And you? Don't make a drama just because someone you know cuts off. Let him go! Don't think about it anymore. Nobody has the right to hurt you. That's not it. Suddenly, nothing makes sense anymore. Do you need a metaphysical sense, to sleep with a guy? Yes. Well ... not quite. It's ... I can't be with someone, if I don't feel, that he's a part of me, of what's sacred to me. Of my best. Forgive me, but I tend to feel you'll wake the worst in men. Right now I'm so excited about this series. - When will you start? - In a month. The money must be transferred to another account. Okay? It will be there on Friday. The body remains horizontal... I only ask for two days! Arms move in sync... Why we don't we stick as usual? Because. Well. Why don't we go out a bit? If we go out, I'm not sure they'll let us in again. I'm tired and wait a call. But you've rested for 2 days already! Mom, I'm hungry. I'm hungry, I'm hungry. Drink some water, it makes it go over. We haven't eaten for two days! Look in my coat. There's nothing. A little sweet. Look in my bag. Great, there's money. I'll go to the bakery. - I want that one, please. - You don't have enough. Then just a loaf of bread. Where're you from? ...Venus... What's your name? May I have a large glass of water? Excuse me. I asked downstairs if they could call you, but they sent me directly up. I'm from the youth welfare service. You aren't sick, are you? I want to talk with you about your daughter. Get lost! This is law. All children must go to school. But my daughter gets much better training than in your sheepfarms . I'll write my report. If you want to keep your child... - Children can't come in here. - We're coming for a job ad. I can't let you in with the child. That's ridiculous. I talked with the boss five Minutes ago. I'll replace Vanessa. Ok, come, we'll see... Great! The number that you're replacing, usually comes at 1 clock. Try to be ready in 30 minutes. You'll come after Monika. Give me the tape. I start with this music, then Cissey comes with the drum. Very nice oriental music. Listen, darling, what they like here, is sexy, modern and light. Okay, modern, you know? It's as modern as it gets. Hey baby, do you fuck good? Anything wrong? It's nothing. Tony is looking for you. I think he wants to buy your number. You should be satisfied, You were a real hit. It's not that ... I have other problems. Here... That will cheer you up. You want? Sometimes I don't say no. Shit, It's my turn. Well, I must go. Good luck. Leave the mirror in the dressing room. I want five minutes with my daughter. If you want to see the director, it's now. She's gone afterwards. What's the time? It's a little late to see the director anyway. She'll meet you next time. The suitcase is in the trunk. Will you write to me? Yes, but I don't know where to send the letter. I'll tell you. I'll soon have a flat. I love you. You say that always to your lovers before you hang up. Whiskey, please. My love! How tall you've grown! You'll grow taller than me. I've missed you so much. But now, my darling, we'll be together all the time. Promise me. Swear it. At the moment I haven't... solved my housing problems. It's a terrible crisis! But as soon I find something, you'll come every weekend. Swear it to me, honey! It doesn't depend on me, you know it! - Mademoiselle, what do you want? - Well, a coke. For me too. No, Beaujolais. Aren't you glad to see me? Tell me .... What are you doing? There isn't much to tell. Every day the same stupid discipline! Don't look at me like that! It helps me a little, that's all! I had a such day today ... where I had no time to eat. Not even for my makeup. You look very well. Today was insane! Have you performed? No. Let me explain ... Something unexpected happened. nothing serious. Don't you want that we go? But yes. Just a moment. What are we waiting for? Leon? What the hell are you doing? But ... Look, you had no right to touch that money. I had saved it. It was sacred. Where are you? Sorry, I can't hear you. I'll go somewhere else. Unbelievable. I can't believe it! - I can't believe it! - What are you doing here? Look who's here! That's not possible! My little Pam. Last time we played together, you were so small. I've taught you to walk. - Sit down, Ali. - Just a minute, I don't have much time. Oh, heaven sent you. You can't imagine. Just today I'm in a terrible situation. I had saved money ... to spend with Pam, and this morning... someone stole it. If I get this son of a bitch ... How much do you need? It's the end of the month, but here you are. I'll pay you back next week. You see... it's important that I treat Pam decently, or I'll loose custody. I'll loose my rights and... If they take the most important, I have in the world ... I don't know what I'll do. Don't cry, big girl. At the moment it's okay. We'll meet again every day. We'd like a room. - For how many nights? - One. - Three? - No, one. Maybe three ... We'll see. Okay, okay. First floor, room 6. Good night. And I said: If you want to my number, pay me a drink! Nicely said. No, it's true. Am I dreaming? Hey, you need glasses or what? Now he's lost his memory. Don't take it serious. I shall not take it serious? That's too much! Some people are incredible! Do you think this villain can ... come and go as he likes? I've been waiting for him all day! Hello, big coward! A paper tiger, that's what he is. A paper tiger. Lon. Good! The memory comes back. We've been worried! I don't let me curse by that slut. Do you know her? I'm not sure. Actually, no. Why? You've been with her before, right? Are you here with friends? Yes. Do you want a drink? I'm Kiko. That's Clemente. I don't know. It's hot here. What's your name? Here, Pam. We're going to a birthday party. Are you coming? No, I've promised my dad to come home early. I look after him. He isn't good. Let's go to the party for a while and then we drive you home. Where do you live? Very close. Where's the presant for Barbara? Taxi! Clemente, you follow with the bike? - Okay, five minutes. - Good. What are you doing? You lock us in. - Stop it. No, don't. - But you like it. I know it. Stop it. Stop or I'll scream. Whore! You bitch! All for 50 francs. Special offer for lovers. I'll take one. Pam, you're tired. Come. Come on. How old are you, Pam? I'm wondering where "Annie Ferrand" is set? Over there. Aren't you ready with the brothel? That wasn't intended. - I know Elsa, but we are late ... - Patrick, can you hear me? What happens with this scene? We go directly to the scene with the criminals. You're done. - Do you like the long scene? - No, but we have no choice. The plan was to shoot this beautiful touching scene in close-up. Sorry, we don't have time! Well, what do we drink? Oh, Krista? My cell phone was off. I forgot to put it back. Listen, I'm popular, but a commercial for ham .... There must be limits. How much? How much would you say? I don't know. Listen ... I'll call you tomorrow. Kiss kiss. Bye. You know, how many TV viewers lives I intrude every month? I think ... I dreamed of being an actress ... for example ... Listen, honey. I got an idea. They are preparing the next episode. They are looking for an actress. Someone like you. It's a very important role in the film. I can suggest you. I'm not an actress! You could do it really good. That's nice of you, but I doubt I'm the right type. Honestly, I think you are. Think it over. You see the view? It can even be bought. Go. I simply looked at him. He didn't see me. He wouldn't recognise me anyway. Whenever you tell the truth, no one believes you. He wouldn't recognise me anyway. And ... whenever you tell the truth, no one believes you. There. She is it! She can easily switch from light to heavy. This woman is always changing. Never where you expect her! That's right. - Well, I could describe what ... - Some scenes. I could rewrite a few scenes. I just wanted to ask you! Now I see very well, how that person can... add a kind of brutality and ... how can I say ... animality with some ... subtlety to it. Look for another one. She's the person, I agree. Be inspired by her. But look for another one. Like her! - Excuse me, but ... - That's not possible. We all agree, that she is the person. So why not? It's easy. We don't want a stripper. She isn't a stripper. She is a dancer! Do it, Mademoiselle. It's quite clear. Nothing naked, no erotic allusions. A clean reputation. You understand? Clean. Relax your mouth. Again. - What? - The movement. Stop. Look at me, look at the lens. That's it. Very good. Think of something pleasant that you don't want to stop. Great. Chin down. Wonderful! Awesome! Well, look at the camera. What's up? Nothing. I thought of all those Sundays, I spent at home. Every time the door opened, I hoped my mother would get me. I stayed there, didn't move, staring at the door. But the corridor became dark. I'm dizzy. Do you remember the first time you took me in your arms? - Can you turn around? - Where? To the roundabout. Why? I wanted to take you to a place you'll love. Two minutes, please. I think I've seen something. And now? Nothing. Forgive me. Give me your coat. I keep it. Thanks. And now ... tell me how you got out of the asylum today. A friend wrote a letter with a fake signature to ... the Director, that my mother invites me to dinner. I've got something for you. Maybe I'm shortsighted, but I'll always recognize you. You are unique. Tunde, what a surprise! And the tests? The agency is very pleased. They want better prints. Of course. This is Pam. - I'll call you and we'll select them. - Okay. - Do you think I could be a model? - Maybe. First you must finish school. You talk like my father! Right, I feel being your father. - Yes, but you're not! - A father in love! And I feel like a woman! Good morning. Police. Your passport, please. But seriously ... Clemente. My dear little Clemente ... Do you think I could be a model? You're too beautiful, Pam. Too different, not the usual clich. I'm not big enough and I don't have blue eyes? Why do you think I wanted to take photos of you? I'm still working in fashion, but I want something else. Beauty is essential. For you, for me. But beauty appalled from within... follow me? After we recently made these images, I began to paint. I feel I'm on the right track. I want to show you what I've done. Hi, Pam? Isn't that 015320? Wait. Yes, 015320. And are you? I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm Pam's mother. I want to talk to her. Then wake her up. Why? I know it's an asylum, but I should be able to talk to my daughter! But I need to talk to my daughter. It's wrenching my ovaries. I need to talk to her. Now! Tomorrow. Tomorrow will never come. Wait. Don't hang up. Say something. Say something to me. May I talk to Clemente? He went to buy a bottle of wine. He'll be back in 10 minutes. Can I forward a message? I knocked, but nobody answered. I want to see Lily. I want to see my mother! Pam, my girl! You come at the right time. - Do you live here? - I just come along sometimes. We just wanted to eat. Sit down. What do we have today? A little cake, Jam, Peas. And now ... The light from the star, the gift! The guard was in a good mood. It's silver. The guard? Yes, the guard. I work in a hotel. "Le Palace". Each night the staff is checked by a warden, when they go home. Some are really nasty, but others are cool. You know, the Vietnamese... You know, Moussa, she lives beyond the city ring. Exactly, her name's Ten. Well, once she smuggled out an entire hotel room. - In her bag? - Yes, in her bag. Everything. The bed, the drawers, and two bedside tables with marble tops. Everything's in her apartment now. I want to talk to Lily. Of course, honey. She'll wake up! Is she sick? She's just a little sad. She cries a lot lately. And doesn't want to eat. Like a baby. It will go over. You're really good friends, Lily and you. We know each other almost since I first came to Paris. She worked in a restaurant then, it's closed now, the "Djezair". She was very young and very shy, but when she started to dance ... she was the Scirocco in person! Do you know my father? No, I do not know him. That's a pitty, I would have liked that. .. Want to see my daughters? Look. She's almost your age and this one's still very young. - Where are they? - In Algery , with my wife. In my country there's a song: "I'm glad your're coming." "How did you come?" "In a dream, or in a car?" What happened to you? - Don't start asking! - Please, Mom, tell me what happened? What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. If you already won't tell me who my father is, tell me who beat you! Leave her alone, Pam. Moussa and I don't let her down. But we can't protect her from herself. Do you understand? ...in uniforms ... Passport, passport... Squatters! Get lost! Residence permit, work permit, food permit. You're a magician. - What's your secret? - L'hotel Palace! Come on, Moussa! Brother, you won't risk anything. Alcohol passes quickly through your body. When death comes, you're not impure. But pork is different. The body needs 3 days to digest it. Pam wants to know the truth. Everyone wants to know the truth. Like dogs they're after the truth. They're fighting in the name of the truth. Eventually the truth... is the last stop! They want to catch the truth. I don't want the truth. I want magic. My past... I'll throw in the bucket... together with the kleenex... Pardon sir. Attention! She might be armed. Are you hurt? Answer me, Pam. Please, Tunde, shut up! Charming. What have you done to me? What have you done to me? Listen... Rest a bit, and I'll drive you home. - What are you doing? - I'll drive you home. You'll drive me home? Where to? Come on, let's go. Come on, drive me home to my mother. - Calm down! - Want to see my mother's house? The rats have eaten a piece of door. It's so cute! And you also want to see my mother? She's irresistible. And my father? You could bring me to my father. But ... shit ... I've forgotten the address. Too bad, you'd like my father, he's a great guy. A guy just like you. An insanely loyal guy. What can I do? What can I do with all you assholes? The feast of a thousand colors! That's enough! Stop it! That's beautiful, right? - I'm fed up. - Stop it! Have fucked her good? And her? And her? - Careful, it's hot. - No, thanks. We can't continue like this! If you don't start again, I'll never do it again... I swear, never again. I promise, darling! My big love! I don't want to see you anymore. Oh no. You can't do that. No, you can't do it, I have only you. I have only you. Stop it. You're the only one I have. Stop it! You're crazy! Stop it! Hello, police? Come quickly. An accident.
