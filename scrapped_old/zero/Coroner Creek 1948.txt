 

                        Howdy, Danning. - Find any of them? You're lucky, the buck wants to buy him a new wife. He's a Chiricahua Apache so he'll take your money. You better give me that gun, it's hard to keep your temper if you ain't used to them. They'd aggravate the flies off of a buffalo. - I'll keep my temper. You been an Indian scout as long as I have, you learn to be patient. I've been patient. For 18 months. Let's go. He wants to see the colour of your money. How can I be sure he was in on the hold-up? That's where he got this withered arm, he caught a chunk of lead. Smoke him out. He was with a bunch of young bucks led by a renegade Indian named Tona, a white man hired them. What about the white man? This white man who used to work for a stage and freighter line knew about a mine payroll going through. Filled Tona and his bucks full of fire juice so they'd raid the coach. Promised to make them all rich Injuns, only he made most of them dead Injuns. He got away with all the money for himself. What about the passengers? The white man shot them right there. All except the girl. What happened to her? He kept her prisoner for three days, then she killed herself with this. It's the white man's knife. The white man, what did he look like? Everything he can remember. Big. Strong. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. A scar on his right cheek and spoke Apache like it was his own language. That's all he knows. Big, strong, yellow hair, blue eyes and a scar on his right cheek? Let's hightail. How much I owe you, Mac? - Not a thing. If I'm not being too nosey, you working for the mining company that lost the payroll? No Then what's your personal interest? Like you said, personal. - I doubt if you'll ever catch him. I got the rest of my life to try. And if you do? I'm going to kill him. That girl on the stage coach maybe? Maybe. 'Big, tall, blond, a scar on his right cheek.' 'A stage and freighter man. A stage and freighter man.' 'Tombstone, we'll keep going.' 'A stage and freighter man.' 'A scar on his face.' 'Now for Tucson.' 'Big valley.' 'He speaks Apache.' 'We'll keep going.' Howdy. - Howdy. Rub him down and feed him. - Yes, sir. Hand me that gun. Thank you. Good night. - Good night. What do you want? According to the book, room number nine is supposed to be empty. If you look at your key you'll find it's room number six. Oh. I had it upside down, excuse me. You're new in Coroner Creek, aren't you? Yes, just got in. - Perhaps you can help me. Will you come in? What's the matter with her? - She, er... She doesn't feel well. Why, she's drunk. I know. I've got to get her back to her ranch. Her buggy's in the alley at the back, if you could take her home - If she drove in, she can drive back when she sobers up. - I didn't want her to go home alone. I suppose it is a favour to ask. - I need sleep, I've ridden a long ways today. Then I'm sorry I mentioned it, your sleep is far more important. Your room's across the hall. It's alright, I'm Kate Hardison, I run this hotel. You run this place? - What's so strange about that? Oh, nothing, lady, nothing. My name's Chris Danning. Abbie? Abbie, wake up! Abbie! That's Apache talk. She learned it from her husband. Who is her husband? - Younger Miles. Miles, Younger Miles. Is he the man that runs the freight line across the street? - Yes it is. Now if you'll excuse me... You misunderstood me a moment ago, I'll see that she gets home safely. I was just thinking it funny you trusting a stranger to take her. I didn't want to shame her by asking someone she knows. Besides, if her husband comes looking for her I want to be here to tell him a lie or two. Just where is this Rainbow Ranch? - At the south edge of town, the alley leads to the road that passes it, the horses will take you. - I'll find it. You alright, Mrs Miles? - Yeah, she's alright. Who are you? - I might ask you the same question. Get out before I kick you out. - I'll do my talking from here. You will, huh?! Now maybe you'll talk, huh? What where you doing with her? - Kate Hardison asked me to take her home. She's been that way since I first saw her. Then why didn't you say so sooner? Saved us both a lot of trouble. You should have asked me. You men take Mrs Miles home. I'll see you back to town. Much obliged, I get awfully scared in the dark. Yeah, I'll bet. Hey, Mac! Take care of them. - Right, Ernie. Have a drink? - No, thanks. What do you figure, riding on through or stop over for a while? - That depends. If you want to stick around, Miles can always use another man-sized hand out at the Rainbow. He's a good boss too. I'll think it over. - Good. About tonight, like I said, I made a mistake. Ah, forget it. Match? - Thanks. About Mrs Miles, what happened tonight is Younger Miles' private business. If you're smart you'll keep it that way. If he was smart hed keep her home. Mr Danning? You couldn't have made it to Rainbow and back, who'd you meet? The Rainbow crew, they took over. Oh, Abbie will be alright then. Which one of them hit you? - Ernie somebody. You came back in pretty good shape. You must have hit him too. - I got in a couple. Good for you, everybody wants to hit Ernie but nobody ever does. Is that why you asked a stranger to take her home? I didn't know you'd run into them. I'm glad you're not hurt. Yeah, I'll second that. You must be hungry. I got a large platter of steaks and apple pie. Well, well, what are we waiting for? Kate! Oh, would you do me another favour first? Well, I... - Come with me. There's someone outside I want you to help me with. Another drunk? - Oh, no, I've handled my last one of those for tonight. This is my father, Walt Hardison. Dad, this is Chris Danning. How do you do? - How do you do, sir? So you the hand Ernie Combs wants for Rainbow? You've got good ears, Mr Hardison. - A cripple's pastime. Thank you. The Good Book is also a cripple's pastime, a very pleasant one, although some people try to run away from it. That's very hard to do. It's your bedtime, Dad. I think you'd better come in now. Abbie. Abbie! When are you going to stop this sort of thing? - Nobody saw me. You let a strange man bring you home, didn't you? - I don't remember. That's the trouble, you don't remember. I've told you a dozen times, drink yourself into a stupor, but do it in your own room. I don't want anyone seeing you. Of course you don't. Because a respectable wife keeps nice folks from talking. That couldn't have been the reason why you didn't marry that girl you moved to Brush Flats, could it? Because it hasn't stopped you from making regular visits over there. You and your pretence of respectability. And respectable is what we're going to be. To the people outside this house anyway. I've worked too long and too hard to build up my position around here. I didn't get married to have a drunken wife pull me down. Of course you didn't, you married me because you thought I was pretty enough to dress up this house and wear fashionable clothes and impress people you could use. That's why you married me. Can you blame me for trying to forget that? Can you? Is Miles around? No, he hasnt come in yet. He spends most his time at the ranch. You McKeogh, his partner? - No, I'm Charlie, Charlie Weatherby, and there ain't no partner. Miles left McKeogh's name on the sign when he bought him out. I seem to remember the deal now, quite some time ago. Oh, not so long ago, a year and a half. 18 months, eh? - About that. Hey, look out there, mister! Whoa! Thank you. I'm going to see Kate for a minute, you wait here. Well if I ain't exactly in eyeshot when you want me, Miss Harms, just give one whistle like this. Easier than that, I'll poke my head in that door of that saloon. You're sure set on running me down one way or another. I extend my apologies, mister. And to show you I'm sincere, I'll buy you a drink. You made a deal, mister. Here's to an easy saddle and good riding, friend. May your boots never get dusty and your guns never get rusty. Longfellow, huh? - I reckon. How are you, boys? Hello, Jack. Step up, men, first round's on me. Take care of the boys at the card table. - Sure, Ernie. Hello, Danning. Oh, now, Jack, you know better. Get that stuff with the beat on it. The best is none too good for my friends. That's a little better. Must be lush country when ranch hands can toss money around like that. Ranch hands, ha! They're Younger Miles personal gun hands. Them's the fellas what's keepin him in business. This Miles must be pretty big around here. What kind of a man is he? Judge for yourself, he's coming in the door now. Set them up again, Jack, a special for the boss. That fellow Danning around? - Over in the corner with Andy. 'Big, strong, yellow hair, blue eyes, and a scar on his right cheek.' I'm Younger Miles. Ernie says you can't make up your mind about working for me. That's what I told him. Ernie wants to buy you a drink. - Huh? Oh, I see. When I pay a man I expect him to be loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. And if you don't pay him? He still gets paid, some other way. Hey, you there, you know Mrs Miles? - Sure. I took her home last night, she was drunk. Dead drunk. Alright, everybody. I'm serving a notice on all you evildoers to make yourselves scarce 'cause the majesty of the Law just arrived. Well, just in time! - Yes, Sheriff, just in time. How's that lovely daughter of mine, Miles? - Abbie's fine, Sheriff. We were just talking about her. - Good. You couldn't talk about a nicer girl. I've never seen you before, you're a stranger, aren't you? Welcome to Coroner Creek. I'm Sheriff O'Hea. Any friend of Miles is a friend of mine. Come over and have a drink with us. - Some other time, Sheriff. Why'd you let him get away with it? He wanted me to draw. I wonder why? 'Yes?' - May I see you a moment? Who is it? - I'm Della Harms. I said, what do you want? - I wonder if you could help me? - I doubt it. I need a man to run my ranch. - Not interested. The work wouldn't be too hard. - Sorry. So am I. After all, I suppose it was foolish of me to think you'd be interested in my fight with Younger Miles. Wait, who did you say you were? Della Harms. - Why do you particularly want me to work for you? I heard you talking to Miles, he's never taken that from any man. That's why I thought you'd be the one to stop the Rainbow crowd. Stop it? - Yes, stop Younger Miles. He came here with money and it's given him means to make more. The stage line, Rainbow Ranch, now he's after my place - the Box H. If you have title he can't steal it. - He has ways that he can, legally. There isn't enough open range for both our outfits. And he's trying to squeeze me out. But with you on my side we might do the squeezing. - Yes, we might. Thank you so much. Chris, isn't it? We'll show Miles that he can't bluff us. Kate, congratulate me. I've hired him. - He's a stranger here, Della, a drifter, you don't know anything about him. I know enough about him to want him to work for me and that settles it. Well, Kate, how do you like the new material? It's beautiful, would make a lovely dress. Must have been expensive. - It wasn't cheap, the best in Kansas City. When Roy was alive he used to say "Every time you get a new dress, I have to cut out a dozen head of cattle to pay for it." Speaking of cattle, I gotta get back. Tell Chris to hurry. Goodbye, dear. Andy? Are you ready, Miss Harms? - Yes. Andy, you ride Mr Danning's horse. Huh? Yes, ma'am. Hey, tell me something will ya, how comes Miss Harms hired that drifter? Don't tell me, I know, most women ain't got no more sense that a sheep herder. What did you expect to gain by insulting Abbie Miles in public? What has she ever done to you? - Nothing. Was it to get at Younger Miles? Cos if it was you've hurt her much more than you could ever hurt him. For the room. And now you're gonna work for Della Harms? - That's right. Have you stopped to think what you'll start? - From what Miss Harms told me that's already started. What are you after anyway? - Now that's my business. From what I've seen of your business it means nothing but trouble here. Why don't you ride on through? - When I'm ready. You're sick with hating, aren't you? Why don't you finish it now and go? I'll finish it. A little every day. Mr Danning, you ride with me. Andy will bring your horse. Yes, ma'am. Well, there goes another foreman of Della Harms we'll have to run out of this part of the country. What's wrong with him? - I don't know. His spirit is dead, you can see it in his eyes. They're ugly, but his face isn't. He just doesn't care. Then why should you? - I don't. All of that as far as you can see is the Rainbow Ranch. With Younger Miles sitting at the end of the Rainbow, eh? That's right, Mr Danning. I don't imagine he's a man who'd take kindly to losing that position. Losing is the one word that drives Younger Miles crazy. Crazy? You know, Miss Harms, that's an idea. That green patch there starts at the Box H. Take care of Mr Danning's horse. Since when - - Andy, do as I say. - Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Well, how do you like it? Pretty fancy. - I just can't stand disorder. Nice layout, did you and your husband build it together? No, he had it running when I met him. - Where was that? That was eight years ago. He's been dead for over two. Must have been pretty tough for you alone? It has been lately. I'll take these in the house. You wait here, I want to introduce you to the rest of the hands. - Yes, boss lady. Chris, I want you to be happy and comfortable here. Leach? Frank? I want you to meet my new foreman, Chris Danning. Chris, this is Frank Yordy and Leach Conover. How do you do? How do you do? I'll leave you all to get acquainted. After supper we'll discuss our plans. Foreman, huh? Andy's been telling us about you. - Yeah? Yordy, I looked at them west boundary fence posts, they don't need fixing for another couple of weeks yet. Besides, I got to paint some cupboards for the kitchen tomorrow. Say, who's going to transplant them flowers? Yordy? I said who's gonna transplant them flowers she wanted done? Maybe Mr Danning will do it. He likes to throw dirt around. Let's put things straight before we go any further. I'll tell you this, starting now you're tying in to hard work. You'll polish saddle leather from dawn to dusk, longer if I'm going to ramrod this outfit. Maybe that's one thing you ain't gonna do. I ain't taking orders from no loud mouth, neither are Andy or Leach. Go on, Yordy, flap your tongue some more. Sure I will, if you had any sense you'd be over the black boughs. We don't take your kind of talk in this part of the country. What you think you're gonna do when Younger Miles opens up on you? This, Yordy. Saddle up and get out. Now I said. What about you, Andy? - Who, me? Walk out if you want or stay and fight Rainbow. I ain't never shot a man, I don't even pack a gun. Then start now. You, Leach? - Think I better fix them boundary fences. Guess I better get started cleaning out the hen house, I reckon. There you are, up beyond Feserley Canyon is where the Box H has stopped for years. Open range and 400 miles. That's finished now. - Dried out? Froze out more like it, by Rainbow. If he's taken it over we can take it back. Not Feserley Canyon you won't. Six months ago one of Rainbow's hands, Tip Henry, filed a homestead claim on it, if he stays out the year on it it's his. Then sells it to Miles. I want to look at Tip Henry's shack on the quiet. How far is it? About a mile. But I can think of a lot of scenery I would rather see. Don't move. Andy, throw that drifter's gun away. What's the matter, Stew, this ain't no way to act. - Shut upl You're both coming with me. Come on, move! Ernie? Ernie! Where'd you find them? - On Rainbow property. Just coming up to meet my neighbours. Well you met them, take a good look. I don't see anything worth looking at. - You don't, huh? Take it easy, itchy fingers. You tough drifters will never learn. Been everywhere, seen everything. Pretty handy with a six-gun, huh? - Maybe. Get down. Let's find out how tough you really are. Hey, wait a minute, Ernie, Chris ain't done nothing. - Shut up, Andy. Go home and take care of your flower garden. - Flower garden? You heard him, go on back to your knitting. No witnesses, eh? That's right. Get going, Andy. Tip, come here. That's how to treat those tough drifters. Bust up their trigger fingers. Now watch him dog it out of here. Remember, Tip, when he comes to, put him on his horse and head him for the black boughs. Tell him to keep riding. - Sure, Ernie. Hold it! Drop them gun belts, all of you. All of you! You too, Ernie. - You'd better me careful, Andy, those things go off. Where is he? What did you do with him? Last we seen of him was heading for the black boughs. Somebody better start talking or I'm going to blow somebody apart! Did you do that, Ernie? - Why, Andy, you know better. His horse bit him. Ernie, I think I'm going to shoot you. Hold it, Andy, you just take care of the others. I'll take care of them. Get over here! Don't any one of you make a move. How did he do it? Somebody better start talking. He stomped on it. Which one of you is Tip Henry? I am. Listen, Henry, you homesteaded this place for Miles. You've got six months left to live on it, to make it what Miles calls legal. Half those nights I'll come back and shoot it up until you move or I kill you. And you can tell Miles I won't need any Indians to help me. I'm sorry, dear, I didn't mean that. I know you didn't, it's the only thing that seems to help. I understand but drinking doesn't answer anything. I thought I told you to keep away from here, Abbie. I was just visiting with Kate. - Visiting, huh? The whole town's talking about your last visit with her. Get this straight, Younger. Abbie's never done any drinking here. Kate was only trying to help me the other night. Which is more than you've ever done, Younger. Well, howdy, folks. I'll be darned if I don't believe you and that man of yours are the best looking couple in Coroner Creek. Katie, there's nothing like a marriage to keep a woman looking beautiful. Is there anything wrong, daughter? No, Dad, I was just... That new piano I bought Abbie was sent out to the ranch today. She ought to be there. - Yes, of course she should. We'll finish our talk at home. - A new piano. You're a mighty lucky girl. All of the things Miles has done for you. Yes, all he's done for me. He's done a lot for you too, hasn't he, Dad? He sure has, why, I wouldn't even be sheriff if it wasn't for him. What's the matter with her? Seems like everyone's jumpy today. Bring me this pot roast, a lot of gravy. Bring a little catsup too. Here you are, Mr Miles. You can't tell me about Danning, I know all about him, Tip. Come on, have another drink. What are you doing away from Feserley Canyon, Tip? I guess you ain't heard what happened to Ernie? I heard about it. What's it got to do with you? What's it got to do with me? Danning's kicked me off my own claim, I'm scared, Miles. He's the kickinist-off dodo I ever seen, he run me of the Box H. I can understand you being scared, Yordy, but Tip here - - I wasn't scared, I told that big... - I'm scared. I'm scared good. And I'm quitting. You're what? - I'm quitting. I paid your fee to farm on that land. I'm paying you good wages. I'm feeding you. I'm giving you $1,000 for that quarter section. Isn't that enough? You don't get it, there ain't enough money in the world to keep me there. I'm quitting. I ain't never going back there, he'll kill me. I'll send some men out there with you every night. - He'd kill them too. He's crazy! - Say, I'd like a crack at that... - Shut up! You haven't got a title to that land until you've proved up on it. Where does that leave me? I don't know, but it leaves me alive though. - If anybody takes a shot at you he'll be hunted down by the US Marshal. We can't afford to hunt him down ourselves, it ain't legal. Say, that wouldn't stop you, Mr Miles. - Yordy, someday somebody's gonna poke your tongue down your throat. What happens to Danning isn't going to interest me, with me in my grave. He said he'll come back every night and shoot up the place until I move or got killed. And he said to tell you that he wouldn't need any Indians to help him do the job. What did you say about Indians? I don't savvy the Indian part. Did you know Danning from some place else? That will teach you not to walk out on me, you yellow back. Mr Miles! Just the man I'm looking for, Sheriff. If it's about filing charges against Ernie, you won't get anywhere, you hit him first. I hit him last, Sheriff. - My friend, you're headed for trouble. You giving the folks around here no reason to love you. I'll do my best to protect you because it's my job. I appreciate that. - It's also my job to warn you that Frank Yordy is spreading stories that he's gunning for you. Did Miles tell you that? - Yes, I did. But I didn't think O'Hea would pass it on. I want him to know what's going on so he can keep an eye on you two. That's real nice of you. - We don't go in for backstabbing here, Danning, no matter whose. This is a law-abiding community. - Yes, and I aim to keep it that way. You'd better tell that to Miles, not me. Now look here, Miles... He already knows that! Personally I don't think there's going to be any trouble. Personally I think Yordy's just bluffing. Personally I think... Personally I think we might as well forget... Don't move, Yordy, until I tell you to. Don't even put down that skillet. Well, it's hot. You going to be hot all over before I finish with you. What do you want with me? - A little straight talk. I can't hold it any longer. Keep them high, Yordy. I heard you were out to get me? Get you? Where'd you hear that? Miles told the sheriff. - Miles? That's a lie. I figured it was, that's why I'm here. What was your deal with Miles? Sheriff O'Hea thinks you're after me. So if I shot you I could claim self-defence. - I never made no deal with Miles. If I shot you just right, say under that left shoulder blade, you know what would happen to you, Yordy? You'd fall face down on that nice hot stove. Ever see a man with the skin burned all off his face, Yordy? You've branded enough cattle, you know what happens to hide when it meets hot iron. You wouldn't get an idea my left hand's slower than your right, would you? But if you'd like to prove it... Well? - Alright, I'll tell you everything. What about a cup of that hot java? Yeah, sure. Better have a cup yourself, settle your nerves. Now you ought to tell me a story. Well, you know that box canyon back of the shack here? Yes. Well, we fenced it off all summer to save the feed. And then about a week ago we turned all of Della's herd into that canyon. What about it? I told Miles that if the fence across the mouth of the canyon accidentally caught... Accidentally caught fire the grass would go. That grass would burn like pitch. What an idea that was, Yordy. The cattle would move ahead of the fire right into that canyon. You murderous snake! What are you supposed to get out of it?! $500. I was to meet Miles at BJ Folkenson's and get half of it tonight and then after I set the fire I was to get the rest of it and head over the pass and get outta here. You think Miles would let you live? He'd kill you after you went back for the other half of the money and I'd be blamed for it. - That's right. Pack your stuff. You're getting out of here right now. And if you ever head back to Coroner Creek I'll be waiting for you. Leach, I got a job for you. Take blankets and ride up to Falls Canyon, I want you to camp there tonight right at the fence. Don't make a fire and sleep light. If anyone drifts up, run him off. This the first time I ever heard the Rainbow outfit called cattle thieves if that's what you mean. I don't, just do as I say. Della? - Hello, Chris. Where's Andy? - Around some place. I just sent Leach up to the canyon to have a look at the cattle. - What for? There might be a few strays. Oh. Aren't you going to notice my new dress? Already have. It's the latest fashion. - It's pretty. Della, about the cattle up in the canyon, let's ship them now, take a profit while we're sure. Let's talk about the cattle another time. - Haven't time, I'm heading for BJ Folkenson's. What you having? - Whisky. It's kind of slow tonight, eh? Anybody else been here? - No, nobody ever comes here. I don't know why you did. The drinks are two bits, keep your own count. I'm going to bed. If you're hiding from someone, you better cover up that bandage. What're you doing here? - I followed you. - Go on back home. Why? - You might not like what you see. Who are you expecting? Younger Miles, he's coming here to meet Yordy. But he's going to find me instead. Get inside quick. Yordy? Yordy couldn't make it. - Who's that? Danning, Yordy's run out on you. I see you're keeping your promise. Yes, a little every day. - Hey! Do your shooting somewhere else, I'm trying to get some sleep! So instead of paying him to set the fire he would have killed him. Chris, why don't you let him go? Let him go? - Yes, you got rid of Yordy. You ran out Tip Henry so Della can have back her open range. You wrecked Miles' scheme there. You forced him to expose himself. Isn't that enough? - Not for me, Kate. Chris, there's something or someone bigger than all of us that takes care of our injuries and squares things for us. I'll do my own squaring, Kate. "Vengeance is mine, I will repay." Remember? I also remember "an eye for an eye." No, Kate, I'm not going to turn back now. Miles must have done something pretty terrible to you. And after you kill him, what's ahead for you then? I hadn't thought that far. You mean you hadn't cared to think beyond that point? It doesn't matter what happens to me. - But you have to live with yourself. Your hatred may destroy Miles but it can also destroy you. Hate is something that can feed on itself for only so long. Don't worry about me. This fight with Miles is in the open now, and it's my fight alone. If anybody gets hurt its going to be me and nobody else. If you got hurt that might hurt someone else. That I can't help. You can but you won't. This thing that happened tonight - I don't want you to say one word about what happened to anyone, not even your father. I hoped I can change you, I see now I can't, nothing can. You're caught in a web of your own making and instead of trying to search for a way out of it, you'd rather strangle it. Yordy? Yordy?! I warned you, Abbie. I'm in my own home. Did that ever happen before, Abbie? When you were a little girl I couldn't bring myself to lay a hand on you. Even to spank you, no matter how wild you got. I never thought I'd live to see the day my girl got slapped and I did nothing about it. A lot of things are beginning to make sense to me now. You've only stayed here on account of me, haven't you? Oh, Dad. You figured an old man was entitled to lie comfortably in the sun when he was through, didn't you? Well, so did I maybe. Chris! Chris?! Chris! Chris! Chris! - What's troubling you, Andy? Get on your horse, I'll tell you on the way back. I got a funny feeling it ain't good. - I'll tell you on the way back. I can't understand why Chris didn't tell. All he said to me was that - Where were you, Leach? I told you to watch the cattle in the canyon. I didn't figure on no fire. I knew Miles' outfit wouldn't rustle our cattle so didn't see the sense in staying. - Nobody asked you to make sense of it. Leach isn't to blame, you didn't tell him it was fire you were afraid of. You were afraid of fire, weren't you? - Maybe. If you told me it was fire you were afraid of I would have stayed. When I give an order I don't want to to explain it, you follow that order. All that cattle lost, maybe you'll tell us who did it. Might have been one of Miles men or even Miles himself, can't prove anything unless Leach saw anything. I didn't see nothing. - You would have if you'd stayed like Chris told you. - It wasn't Leach's fault. It was too, Miss Harms. - Sorry for your bargain, Della? All you brought us is trouble. He brought you Feserley Canyon. Tip Henry quit the country and lost the homestead and you got back your old range. If I remember rightly, I told you I'd go lightly. Hey, what are you all dressed up for? I'm checking out too. - No, you're staying, Andy, she needs you. Not me and Leach both she don't. - You belong here, you're as much a part of the Box H as that post there. Oh, I suppose so. But I'm not letting you ride out of here alone. Rode in alone. Drifting? - That's just about it. Soon as I've finished a little bit of business in Coroner Creek. One thing I never will forget, the way you walloped the dickens out of that Ernie Combs that morning. We done alright, didn't we? - You did, Andy. Well, so long. Take care of things. - Sure, Chris. Better get out of these town duds and into my working clothes. Chris, I'm sorry for what I said a while ago. I was so upset. Will you forgive me and stay on? I'm not letting you down, I'll find the man that set that fire and you'll be paid back for the cattle you lost. There's nothing more I can do here. Yes, I know. You think more of your personal battle with Miles than you do with my loss, don't you? If you put it that way I do. But remember this, you've got to face losing as well as winning and if you can do that you'll be alright. I'll be alright. I know what it means to win. I know what it means to lose too. Good luck, Della. Come in. That's alright, Miss Harms, I shouldn't have let myself be caught mid-stream like this. Andy, I have a job for you. I want you to go up and take over Tip Henry's shack and homestead Feserley Canyon for us. Is that an order, Miss Della? - Yes it is. Oh, Andy, I'll send Leach up later with provisions. Yes, ma'am. Homestead, Feserley Canyon? Where are you going, to a powwow? That'll learn you. When you're told to sleep by the fence sleep by it, I reckon. Hi, Danning. I had an idea you'd show up here. - Why? Younger Miles rode into town, was asking for you. That's why I'm waiting. Well? - Just to warn you to keep awake and stay out of the open. Is that one of Miles' orders? - Wait a minute I don't want your advice, save it for your boss. And if you see him before I do you can say I'm looking for him. Alright but Younger Miles ain't in town on Sunday for no church going. There's something peaceful about a church bell, isn't there, Dad? I don't know. Something ominous about the way it sounds today. There's an unhealthy air about the whole town. Jack, has Younger Miles been in here? - No, I ain't seen him all morning. Come on, boys, drinks are on the house. - How come? Because Miles ain't here. Morning, Chris. Oh, good morning. Abbie, this is Chris Danning. How do you do? I've been hoping I would have a chance to talk to you. If you'll excuse me. - Certainly. I owe you an apology for a couple of raw remarks I made. I accept your apology. Although it was your right to say what you did. I don't think any man has that right. Although at the time I thought it would serve my purpose. You know, in a way I'm grateful to you, Mr Danning. - Grateful, how? Miles is a cruel man but he always checked himself before he went too far. It wasn't until you came to town that he began to lose control. Well, I hope things will be better for you now. They will be, now that I've left him. Kate, I'll meet you at the church. I'm very pleased to have met you, Mr Danning. - Thank you. Kate, I'd like to have my room back. What happened at the Box H? - I quit the Box H. You quit? But why? Falls Canyon was fired last night and Della's prime bunch of two year olds was wiped out. How could you leave at such a time? Well, I can help her more by finding the man that did it and making him pay. Miles? - That's why I'm in town. That's a job for the law, isn't it? The law? In this town, where the sheriff's working for Miles? - Not any more. O'Hea's against him and wants to fight him. Why don't you join the sheriff and fight with him? No, Kate, Im sticking to my own way. Kate! I'm sorry. I wish I'd known you before. - Why? Because there's a better side to you. You're letting your hatred for one man destroy it. You seem to know a lot about it. I know all I need to know. Except the beginning. I even know the ending. There only be one ending. But it's beyond that that's troubling me the most, not just the killing of Miles, you're wondering whether it will bring you freedom and the peace of mind you always thought it would. You don't think it would, do you? - I can't give an answer to that. You'll have to get it over with and find out for yourself. Who you got there? - Andy West, he's been killed. When did it happen? How? I came up on him at Tip Henry's homestead, he said he was planning to take over. He pulled a gun on me, it was me or him. He got it. He's telling the truth. I saw it all. Tell the sheriff what you told me. - Well, I... - Tell him! I saw him kill Andy. - He's a liar, O'Hea. - Shut up. Now, Leach, just what did you see? - Well I was riding up to Tip Henry's shack to take Andy some grub. Just as I was coming into the clearing I saw Stew and Ernie, I heard him tell Andy to get. Andy started to go and Stew shot him in the back. - You dirty little... - Shut up, Stew! O'Hea, if you let them ride out of here... - They're not riding anywhere. Get off them horses, both of you. - What for? - I'm arresting you. We wrote all the way in to give Andy a chance to be buried decent! You ain't arresting us for protecting ourselves. And neither is anybody else. You heard what the sheriff said. Get in there! Alright, Ernie, inside. You must have forgot what side your bread's buttered on, O'Hea. You know, Danning, it feels good to get up off my knees. I know what Andy meant to you, Chris. I'm beginning to understand. Then you see, Kate, why I have to do it my way now. Yes I do. Good luck, Chris. Well, boys, all I can say is this has been the most exciting Sunday that ever happened at Coroner Creek. Sure was surprising to see the sheriff put Younger Miles' boys in jail. Surprising to see him jail anybody. Have you seen Miles today? - Nope, but if I was him and Chris Danning was looking for me, I'd want to be sleeping in jail with my boys. Howdy. - Howdy. Looks like you been riding hard, Danning. Not hard enough. Looking for Younger Miles.. Seen him? - No I ain't. Alright, O'Hea, that was a pretty good show you put on but you can open up this chicken coop now and open up the back door. Ernie, I'm telling you for the last time, you're staying in there until you get a fair trial. Fair trial. - You heard what I said. Why, you mangy old crow. Younger Miles will have something to say about that! Maybe. - O'Hea? What's the idea of locking up my boys? You always said you wanted things done legal. That's just what I'm doing. Just like I told them they're staying in there until they get a trial. What's come over you, O'Hea? I made you sheriff, and I can break you just as easily. Maybe, but until you do I'm still sheriff. I'm going to run things around here according to law. My idea of the law, not yours. If you expect me to sit around and watch you tear down everything I built up you're crazier that I think. I worked hard to get where I am, did everything a man could do. I lied, cheated, stolen, I've even killed to build up the set up I've got now. And I'm not going to let any man destroy it. Least of all you. Dad! Dad! Chris, watch out! Two of Miles men are in here. Keep down. Chris, be careful. I will, you stay down. Where's Miles? - I don't know. Where is he? I don't know, I tell you! - Where is he? In the town hall. We're going over there. Look, Danning, I didn't do nothing to you. Andy was my friend. Ernie killed him. Honest, I swear it. Did you ever get hit with a bullet? It's like a hunk of iron ripping and tearing into you. Sets you all on fire inside. Sometimes you don't die right away, you just bleed, and hurt for a long time. Go on, open that door. No, I can't. I'd be walking right into Miles' bullets. Andy got his in the back. Go on! Don't shoot, Miles, it's me, Stew! Don't come any closer, Danning. Now you wouldn't shoot itchy fingers, would you? He's always done your killing. I told you not to come any closer. Miles! Miles! Miles! Miles! I've waited 18 months for this. Why, Danning? Why? Remember that raid you pulled in Cons Canyon? The girl on that stagecoach was on her way to marry me. Maybe this will help you to remember. Pick it up, Miles. Pick it up. 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.' Chris! You were right, Kate, there is someone bigger than all of us. Then you found your answer? - Yes, it's all over. And the memories? - They're in the past. I'm free, Kate. I know now what I thought was going to be the ending is only the beginning. I'm glad.
