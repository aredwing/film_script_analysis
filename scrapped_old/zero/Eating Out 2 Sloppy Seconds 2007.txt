In themiddleof all of this, of course, isthelovebutton. Butmost girls go nuts if you just... diveon in. That's good. That's really good. Sorryl missed thegame, guys... Whatthehell? Iwas just showing Troy sometips on theart of cunnilingus. Notthatl needthem. Well, even Melissa Etheridge could learn athing ortwo from Kyle. I gotta get going. Stay. There's plentyto eat. Yeah, you don'thaveto go. I gotta call itanight. Thanksfor the... time, Kyle. Did you seethat? One more session like that and he's gonna explode. As long as hedoesn't explodewith Marc first. Iwin! Whoa! What? So when didyou firstknow for sureyouweregay? Justnow. No. I had mysuspicions when I was, like, 12 or 13, butl didn'tknowfor sure until a couple years later- when Iwent down on myfirst guy. And it'sthebest thing that's ever happenedto me. What? Being gay? Yeah. Imaginethatyou think you'regonnalive your lifeoneway- geta job, getmarried, geta 3-bedroomhouse. And then you discover this... thing aboutyourself that opens up amillion new options asto howyou can liveyour life. Suddenly you don'thave those milestones that straight peoplehaveto compare each other against. You can choose your own adventure. I loved those books. Me, too. Butaren't youworried you'll end up all alone and nothave any of those things? Doesn't everyone? Gayor straight? Sprintyou home! And just so you know, Kyle's mom's reaction to himbeing straight wasn'tawesome. Huh? Well, you said itlike you were happyforthem, like that'stheway it should be. Myparents aretotallycool with mebeing gay. Yeah, butareyour parents reallyokaywith it? I'll bet Kyle's momgrew to beokaywith it, butyou sawhow happyshe was. That's whatparents reallywantfortheir kids. Ifyou ask, mostparents will saytheyjust want their kidsto behappy. Maybemymom would behappier ifl putmydick somewhere else, butyou've seen thoseex-gays. Isthathappy? Ifyour parents loveyou and theythinkyou're happy, they'll adjust. I don'tthink myparents would adjust to me being gay. They shouldn't have anythingto do with it. You haveto be who you are. It'stheonlywayyou can livewith yourself. And It'stheonlyway I can liveatall. Didyouwannatakea shower? Talk about getting my creative juices flowing. I didn'tknowyou were here. Wait. Keep 'emdown. Would you boys letme drawyou? What? Together? No, right where you are, rightnow. I'll call it... "Proposition. " What do you think? I don't know...

After him, all I ever wantedto datewerefags. I'vegot an idea. This couldtake forever, and I see thepotential for something... moreinteresting. Could I do a series with you guys? Almostlike a storythat starts with this scene and goesfromthere? What do you think? I don't know... Ifl said posewith awoman, you'd totally do it. It's not likewe'd even have timeto pose for a series... I'lltakephotos and usethemto drawfrom. C'mon, wecan bedone in minutes depending howwellyoutwo... connect. Yeah, butifTroy feels uncomfortable... No. I'll do it. Perfect. I'll getmycamera. You sure? Yeah. Chooseyour own adventure. Okay, Troy, sitback down. Marc, offwith thepants. Perfect. Okay, Troy, stand backup with Marc. I wantyouto do that same character youweredoing, like, he's a virgin and hewants itbuthe's confused. Can you do that? Yeah. So Marc, honey, whydon't you get down on oneknee, and putyour hands underneath... yeah, likethat. Actually, raisetheshirt a little. And liftyour head so you're looking into his eyes. Looklike you're in themoment andyou wantit. Marc, Iwantyou to stand andtakeTroy's... yeah, that. Now, Troy, theremoval oftheshirtis oneof thehottest moments - when you knowsoon you'll beskin on skin, chest on chest, lips on lips. Marc, toss theshirtaside. Marc, lick one ofTroy's nipples.

If Kylewantsto pretend to bestraightjustto have sexwith Troy, that's his prerogative. Butljust can't do this anymore. Well, can weatleast finish the photo shoot? Oh, great. He's probablyfreaking out about making itwith a guy. He's probablylooking for someone who won't cock-tease him. I knowwhere he's going. Ifucked up. Whatis it? I had sex with a guy. Was it Marc? Oh, myGod, that's horrible! I know. Itwas. - Itwas? - Itwas? Ifelt so guilty, because... all I could do was think aboutyou, Kyle. Really? Yeah. Howl letyou down. And howl let thegroup down. And howmore than anything Iwanted to be with a woman. Or with aman and awoman. I don't know... it's all so confusing. And then Ithought of youtwo. Andwhat good friends you've been to me. And howhonest and open you've been aboutyour struggles, Kyle. And abouthowyoutwo have an arrangement. Wait, wait Is thistoo weird? It's nottoo weird. Showme. - Huh? - Showmeyour routine.

The laws ofnature! It's likehorses fucking gerbils! Well, then I'ma freak of nature. And I'mproud ofit. Good! Be proud, bi-boy! Iwish you'd been proud when wemet. But I guessthat's hard when peoplelikeyou andJacob Buchanan tell him howbad itis to begay. Yeah. I'msorry. I should've helped you instead oftryingto takeadvantage of you not knowing whatyouwere. So... what do we do now? We'regonna stop peoplelike me. No oneshouldtakeadvantage of confused queer kids.

Today, Jacob dates girls - and helikes dating girls! Jacob provesthatifyou can fightit, you can hide it! And ifyou can hideit, you can buryit! Ah! Whatwasthat? Thatwas me. Oh God, it was you.
