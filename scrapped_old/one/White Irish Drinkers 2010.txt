Like, you know, an engraving. - So what. - So you can't sell something- that's got somebody's name on it. - What are you, the fucking stolen goods monitor? - No, I'm just saying that you can't sell it if it's- - take it; I don't give a shit whose name's on it. - Come on, danny; It's somebody's birthday cross, man. What the fuck? - Don't waste my time. If you don't got the balls- - look, I'm not gonna take this one, okay? - Then get the fuck out. - What? - You're fucking useless. - You asked me for a favor. - You're my brother. I'm doing you a favor. Now get out. I'll do it on my own. Hey, go the way we came in. Leave the flashlight, asshole. I should have known better. - Yeah, me too. - # oh I got into a fistfight # # on my first day of school # # oh I came home with a fat lip # # and a blackened eye to boot # # oh it seems the local bullyboy # # oh he didn't like me much # # when he knocked me down I got right up # # oh what else could I do # # oh I came home to my old man, told me what I had to do # # 'cause tomorrow that same bullyboy # # be waitin' there for you # # oh there's good and there's bad # # in this world that we live in # # I'm tellin' ya son # # I'm tellin' ya son # - # oh believe what you feel not what you heard # # I'm tellin' ya son # # I'm tellin' ya son # - # I met a girl at 16 # # and she broke my heart in two # # oh I learned to drink at 17, had my first woman too # # oh the times they were a-changin' # # and my old town I outgrew # # had to see the world and live my own life # # so many things I had to do # # well I quit my job at the cannery # # and saved a buck or two # # oh I knew I'd miss old mom and dad # # well it's what I had to do # - When are we gonna get some more es, whitey? - People get the idea. They don't need to see every fucking letter. - You seem crankier than usual today. - We cleared 3 grand on this chuck berry thing, but it's only gonna keep us going for a month. - I'll find us another act. There's plenty of these guys from yesterday that would come and play for a lump sum. - Well, I'm running real low on lump sums, especially with a shylock up my ass. - Maybe we'll get one of the big movies at christmas, run it for a couple of weeks. - If we make it till then. - We've got to advertise. Look at this. There's two pages for the rolling stones at madison square garden. It's the first tour with ron wood. - Who the fuck is ron wood? Sounds like a porn star. - The new guitarist. You know, it wouldn't kill you to stay up on that shit. - That's what I got you for. Besides, the rolling stones have all kinds of money. They can afford to advertise. We can't. Hey, see if you can get buddy holly. He was big once. Now he's not doing shit. - That's 'cause he's dead, whitey. - Well, that's no good. They got to at least be alive. - You really have your finger on the pulse of today. You seen it? - Seen what? Yeah, fuckin' freak show. They'll play a week, never be heard from again. Stop bustin' my balls and get back to work, you little shit. - Maybe a concert every month and the rest of the time movies. - So you think up the ideas, and he makes the money. - It's not like that, ma. He throws me a little something extra when he can. He's barely hanging on as it is. - So you're really on the ground floor of something fantastic here. - We're gonna turn that theater around. - You should turn around and get yourself a serious line of work. - I like what I do. - You like it. What's that have to do with a job? - Sorry, I lost my head there for a second. - You need benefits, job security, a pension. You got a good catholic school diploma. You're gonna throw it all away on a movie theater owned by a guy named whitey? - People are always gonna want to see movies, ma, not just on tv, in theaters. - Eat. - It's too hot. - No, it isn't. - It isn't? The only thing missing are the firemen. - Where's danny? Should I put something out for him? - Sure, you should put out the fire in this soup. - That's very funny, brian, tonight, very funny. Maybe you'd rather wear your dinner. - Hey. What's up? - Dinner's ready. - Mmm, pork chops. What a surprise. - I'm going to the butcher tomorrow. - Uh-huh. - I'll get some chopped meat. - Hey, brian. What do you call an irish seven-course meal? - A six-pack and a potato. - Oh. That's not funny? - I heard it. - Gets a laugh at clancy's every time. Where's the other guy? - Out. - Yeah, I can tell he's out, because he's not here. He's out where? - I don't know. - Paddy, just-just eat before it gets cold. - There's no chance of it getting cold. - There's a chance you'll be making your own dinner from now on. - Hey, let's not get hysterical. - You don't know where your own son is? - He's old enough for me to not know where he is. - I don't give a damn how old he is. He's living in my house. Tell him as long as he's living here, I want to see his ass in that seat at dinnertime. I'm not running a hotel here, and tell him to get his hair cut. You got a problem? - What? - Something you want to say? - Paddy, just eat. - Never know what's going on inside that brain. It's like I've got an alien living here or something like that. Hey, big bri, how are things on planet pansy? Ah, come on. Come on. Laugh, get pissed off, something. Show me you've got some stones. Maybe you're adopted. I don't know. - Dad. - What? - Don't. That's very... - What? [Michael campaga and the average johnsons' off to see the wizard] - Come on. We gonna follow the yellow brick road. Here we go. # well I'm off to see the wizard # # get my business fixed # # with all the problems I got # # I'm gonna need a wizard's tricks # # working and worrying # # lord it's all I ever seem to do # - When I tell them to be at the table for dinner, you better make sure that they're there. - Tell them yourself. - I will. I'm laying down the law right now. - # 'Cause you know the people with all the money # # puttin' a scare on people like me and you # # well I'm going down to the 7-eleven # # yeah I'm gonna play the lottery # # even though you know I know you know I know # - Hey, faggot. Don't worry about it. That one sucked anyway. Is the old man looking for me? - Yeah. - Got something for you. - What's this? - What do you think? - I thought you fired me. - Look, I made a good deal with jimmy cheeks. I'm giving you half. Don't bust my balls. And don't take everything I say so fucking serious. Let me ask you something. What good are all these fucking drawings? I mean, what can you do with them? Can you sell them? - Probably not. - Who'd buy them with all the people out of focus? What is that? - I don't know. Maybe I need glasses. - Maybe you need a kick in the balls. - You've already given me one of those, thanks. - Come on; I haven't kicked you in the balls in years. - Yet somehow, that feels like it was just yesterday. - You're too easy on them, the both of them. They walk all over you. - I can't talk to you when you're like this. - Sounds like a seven. - He broke something before. - Make it a nine. Hey, I got an idea I want to talk to you about. - You know what? I've actually got to go. 'Cause I'm gonna meet my friend todd. He just got back from college. We're gonna go meet him at the kill car. - What was he doing at college during the summer? Must not be that smart. - Yeah, I'll ask him for you. - I got a friend coming back too next week... From prison. Oh, yeah, well, I mean, that's, you know, that's cool too. - Look, I got something new in the works. It could make us some real money. - Danny, listen, I don't want to sound like I'm being- - all right, go if you've got to go. I'll talk to you about it later, all right? - When I applied, they said, "at this school, "you're not just a number. You're a person. " I get there. All they ask is, "what's your social security number? "What's your I.D. Number? What's your course number?" - That's a heartbreaking story, todd. - Seriously. Wake me when it's over. - I don't know why you want to go to four more years of school anyway. Get a fucking job. - Civil service. That's what it's all about, man. Look at me; I'm pulling down 9 gs with the transit authority. I got bennies up the ass, major medical, major dental. The best part is that they can't even fire me. - That is just great news for subway riders everywhere. - There's more to life than getting your root canal paid for, ya hump. - Fuck you, hump. My old man says college means you're haunted for life. You're afraid to go out there and work. - Your old man must be a fuckin' phd, then. Fuck you, flanagan. The best part of you is still dripping down your old man's leg. - Here's the other thing. He's studying, like, technology and computers and shit. - See, trade school I understand, you know, car repair, refrigerator repair, like that. I mean, how the fuck are you gonna make a living off of computers? - I've got one word for you guys. I want you to try hard to understand. The future. - That's two words, you hump. So much for college. - I need more beer. I'm actually losing small chunks of my brain from this conversation. - I don't get it. I'm not getting it. It's not registering. - Hey. Hey. We don't serve your kind in here. - No disco in here. Disco sucks. Move back to bensonhurst, you disco fucks. Get the fuck out of here. - So how's it feel having just wasted your whole fucking summer with that college? - I had to. I'm so fucking over my head. They let me take these prep courses just to get a jump start. I must be the dumbest fuck on that campus. - Why do it? - Gets me out of here. They got this computer. The fucking thing is so small, it fits in one room. The shit that... Look, I know I'm the asshole of the hour because I'm leaving. You know, we always said college was bullshit. - You always said college was bullshit. - Well, I was wrong. I got a chance, and I fucking took it. - Oh, you want a fucking cookie? - Here, I got this for you. Just to check it out. - Oh, no, no. - It's not just a technology school. They've got a kick-ass fine arts program. Andy warhol went there. I hear they even got naked chicks that pose in the art classes. It's a great place. You'll love it. They even got scholarships for underprivileged kids. - Who's underprivileged? - Me and you and every other numbnuts we know. That's who. - Hey, I'm not some fucking charity case over here. - Look, it's just a way in. How do you think I got accepted? - Just always assumed there was a blow job involved. Nice. Look, they got an early admissions program. You could come back with me at the end of the month. - Look, I'm saving up my money. I'm trying to get an apartment of my own, maybe over on 75th street. - Different perch, same cage. - Hey, I'm not gonna make believe I belong somewhere else. - Which one of us is making believe, brian? - Hey, what's going on? Hey, buddy. Hey, there is a broad standing over by the bar who is just checking you out with her provincial vision. - Do you mean peripheral? - Yeah, that too. - Wow. Do you know her? - So do you. She went to bishop clancy. She's a couple years ahead of us. Shauna somebody. - Well, then, go over there. - Oh, get the fuck. - Oh, here, have another bottle of balls, and go over there, ya hump. - She didn't talk to me then. She's not gonna talk to me now. - All right, well... Don't say I didn't give you the first shot. Hey, how you doing? My name's manny. Okay. - Manny your dreams. - Oh, wow. It's good to meet you finally. - It's nice to meet you too. - Yeah, this is... - Really? Yeah, hi. I'm todd. Shauna. That's a very unique name. Okay. - Wow, your skin's so soft. - # There is no love # # she was sent from above # # and I need her # # I love her every day of my life # # there is no love like my baby's love # # when I call her I know she will answer # # I don't have to worry because she's always there # # early in the morning or late after midnight # # I know that my baby will make it all right # # she will make it all right # # and there is no love like my baby's love # # there is no love # # she was sent from above # # and I need her # # I want her every day of my life # # there is no love like my baby's love # # I know that there is no love like my baby's love # - You win. - # There is no love like my baby's love # # I know that there is no love like my baby's love # # there is no love # - Fucking knock. - What's the matter? You afraid I'm gonna catch you stretching the old duke? - What do you want? - Where's the old man? - The bar, I guess. Where else? He's pissed you didn't come home again last night. - Fuck him. I want you to hold on to this for me. - New slippers? - Just hide it somewhere and keep your mouth shut about it. - What is this? You giving me a fucking gun? - I'm not giving you shit. It's mine. I just want you to hold on to it. Nobody will think twice about anything mr. Goody-fucking-two-shoes has. - You hide it. - Don't be a pussy, brian. Help me out. I think the old lady goes through my stuff. Just for a couple weeks until we need it. - What's with this "we" shit? - I told you. I got something new. - No, dan, that's too much. You do something with a gun, that's some serious fucking time. - Are you kidding me? First offense. Besides, I'm not even gonna load it, okay? Hey, pop. - Where your mother? - She's at church. - What's in the box? - Nothing. It's brian's. - Oh, let me ask you something. I come home, every light in the house is on. It's like we're living in the las vegas strip or something, so this made me mad. I'm asking you, should this make me mad? - I don't know, pop. Should it? - You crack wise, I'll put you through the wall. Give me a straight answer. - Yeah, pop, it ought to make you mad. - Why? - Because you got to pay the bills, pop. That's why. - Who dialed your number? - I'm just saying, we know you got to pay the bills. - Outside. - Pop, I didn't mean anything by it. - Outside. It's always something with you, isn't it, huh? Nice of you to show up. You come home to fucking change your clothes? You gonna have a fucking shower? Fucking asshole. Well, here, how about this, huh? Come here. Yeah, maybe you'll remember this next time you don't come home, all right? - Danny, you coming in? - Shh. I'll be right in. It's just a storm. Don't worry. - I can't thank you enough, pete. Really. You have no idea what this means to me. I understand. Okay. Okay, pete. I'll see you on the 28th. Great. Bye-bye. You know who that was? - Wild guess: Some guy named pete? - Pete rudge. Mr. Rock and roll. Pete rudge, the rolling stones' tour manager. - Get out. - I'm not kidding. I met him at a hotel bar once five, six years ago over in the city. His wallet got stolen. I lent him money, gave him a ride to the airport. Long story short, he says, if I ever needed anything... - No fucking way. - Wait, so I see he's in the city with the rolling stones. I figure maybe he's at the same hotel. I call the hotel. He remembers me like it was yesterday. So I tell him about the fiscal complexities that I find myself in- - you're not gonna tell me that the rolling stones are coming here. - One night only, the 28th. They play for an hour, and they're gone. We can only advertise the day of, no advance tickets, door only. The fucking rolling stones are coming to the lafayette. Both: Ahhhh! - You're a fucking genius. - No, it's you. I never would have had the balls to ask if you hadn't gotten concerts going here in the first fucking place. - God, but we can't advertise it? - Not in the papers, but you've got to get out there and spread the word, brian. Let the rumors fly. We'll have a line from here to fucking kansas on the 28th. This is gonna do it finally. I'm gonna be in the fucking black again. - Again? - Okay, for the first time... Ever. Both: Ahhhh! - Got a shitload of work to do, and especially you. You've got to talk to your friends. You've got friends, right? - Yes, I have friends. I will have a million people at this theater. - Just a couple of hundred will do. - Car three, where the fuck are you? A guy's waiting on 75th street. - Hey, phil, I just went by there. There's nobody there. - Hey, faggot, how you doing? - How you doing? - Forget about it; I stayed on my feet the whole time. The son of bitch never knocked me down yet. - Come on. Take a ride with me. - Looks like you already got a fare. - He's shitfaced. Don't worry about it. Get in. Help me out here. - Okay. - All right. Hey. - Oh, what is that smell? - Don't ask. - Yeah, it's all right. - See that place across the street? Jimmy cheeks told me he's got a guy who's looking to buy cases of liquor cheap. - Are we just gonna leave him there? - Yeah, his wife will bring him in when she gets home from work. He's a regular. - You got some classy clientele. - Anyway, liquor central gets a shipment in every saturday night, so if we hit them on a sunday, we can clean 'em out. And jimmy cheeks will get us $500, maybe even a grand, for how many cases we can carry out. - Look, danny, I don't want to do that. - You don't want to split a grand with me? - No, I'd love to, but I don't want to steal anything anymore, and let's face it, I'm not exactly a criminal mastermind, okay? - I'll teach you. That's what brothers are for. - Oh, not really, but I appreciate the thought. - You know, I'm trying to look out for you over here. I'm trying to help you out a little bit. You know, I could ask anyone to help me, but I asked you. - Look, I've got other things going on right now, okay? I mean, you're not gonna believe this, but the fucking rolling stones are coming- - w-w-what are you saying, no? - Come on, danny. - If you came to me like this, you think I'd say no? - I don't come to you like this. - That's 'cause you got no fucking loyalty. - How do you get from talking about robbing a liquor store- - you're a spineless little prick. You know that, brian? - It's been really great talking to you. - I tell you what, I'll wait for my friend ray to get out of jail. At least he's a pro, who won't fuck it up, like you will. - Oh, yeah? If he's such a fucking pro, what's he doing in fucking jail? - Watch your fucking mouth. - Don't fucking hit me. - I'm not hitting you, you faggot. It's a slap, like a girl. You don't even deserve a man's punch. - Don't fucking hit me! Don't fucking hit me! - Or what? Or what? You're a fucking misfit, brian. Remember that. That's all you are. That's all you ever will be, a fucking misfit, mother... Piece of shit. - What? - You got my beer? - Oh, look at this. - Are you shitting me? - I shit you not. - The rolling stones are gonna play lafayette. - Why not? You think they're too fucking good for the lafayette? - Fuck yes, jerry. The harmonicats are too good for the lafayette. - Fucking college snob. - Well, it's simple probability theory. Is it possible the stones are coming to brooklyn? Yes. Is it likely? No. - Well, you just can't stand it that something big is happening right here in brooklyn. See carnegie fucking mellon on the stones tour. - Yeah, what kind of fucking university name is that? Was it a deli or a fruit stand? Believe me, if todd goes there, it's a fucking fruit stand. - Anybody? Huh? - Fuck that, man. I don't do weed. - Yeah, man, me neither. - What are you, the fucking boy scouts now? - No, just fucking tradition, you hump, all right? We don't do smoke. We don't do pills. We don't do needles. We are white... Irish drinkers. We drink. That is what we do. - Brian? - No, my tradition's all tied up in beer. - Oh, hey, hold on. What is this? - Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Leave my shit alone. - New york city department of sanitation? - Ohhh! - You fucking did it, didn't you? You applied. You fucking applied. Yeah! - It's a good job. It's a good job, and garbagemen get paid more than teachers. - You say that like you're proud. - I am. - Listen, jerry, I'm telling you, civil service, you can't beat the bennies. Look at me. I got major medical. I got dental. - Yeah, we know what you got, dennis. - Yeah, you tell us every chance you get. Oh, by the way, do they cover you for having a big fucking mouth? - They cover me for having a big dick. Oh, it's a small policy. - I take the physical next week. Who's got a cigarette? - Pardon me, jerry, you know, I don't mean to offend, but you're a big, fat fuck. They're gonna want you to lift a couple of hundred pounds. I mean, can you do that? - I don't know. Let me see. - Hey, get the fuck away from me. - Next stop, flat on your ass. - Yeah, I can do that. - Watch the closing doors, please. - I didn't think you wanted a job that you had to get up early for. - They're just harder to find than you might think. My parents are getting a little ambivaless about me living here. - You mean ambivalent? - What are you, fucking shakespeare? - It's a word. - Well, I've got to do something. I've got to find my own place. - Oh, man, my parents expect me to live at home till I'm married. It's like a fucking law. - My mom is gonna need oxygen when she finds out I'm getting my own apartment. - These are all, man. If I had money, I'd buy a fucking car, never mind an apartment. - If got on fucking sanitation, I will be set for life. - You would. - You know it? That's paid vacation, good bennies, everything. - Everything. - Yeah. - Bennies, baby. - But is that what you really want to do? - Wait, who are you? - Don't look down on garbage, my friend. See, they even got people who study what you throw out. It tells you all kinds of things about your personality. - Ohhh, what are you gonna do, examine people's garbage and tell them why they lack self-esteem? - Jerry flanagan, garbageman psychiatrist. - The shrink with the stink. - Yeah, well, fuck you all. How about that? How about fuck you? Yeah, and, leary, what do you do, hm? You're a movie usher. You spend your entire day just fucking scraping gum off of armrests. - And no bennies. - You know, I got a lot of options. I could always go into business with my brother if I wanted to. - Yeah, your brother. Like what, gladiator school? - Hey, you guys, I'll be right back, all right? Aww, come on. - We were fucking joking. What's up, man? - So when do you think you want to go? - I don't know. - Yeah, come on. - Were you gonna say something, or are you just gonna keep orbiting? - I am gonna say something, as soon as I think of it. How about this? How do you know jerry? - Who? - It's fine. It's fine. It's completely fine. It's completely fine. Continue the party. - Jerry flanagan, your host. - I just heard there was a party. - Let me ask you a question. What's it mean when an artist does that? - That. Right. No idea. - Where'd you learn to draw like that? - It's just something I could always do. - What's your name? - Brian leary. We went to the same high school. You're shauna friel, right? - Hm, I don't remember you. - Got to go. - Oh, he's my best friend. - Okay, well, I was wondering if maybe sometime- - you're not gonna ask if you can draw me in the nude, are you? - No, I always wear clothes when I draw. I was going to ask you if maybe you wanted to have lunch sometime. - Lunch. - Yeah, lunch is harmless. First date, I always ask about lunch. Dinner's too open-ended. What happens after? You ask about breakfast, you get an instant slap in the face, so that leaves you with lunch. - I can't. I'm very busy at work. - Where do you work? - Olympic travel. - You a travel agent? - You are quick. - So book yourself a trip to lunch. - Got to start packing. I'm moving to I.A. - How come? - Olympic's gonna transfer me. I'm opening up the west coast shop. - No shit. - I wouldn't shit you, billy. - Brian. - # Here is safe # # here is fun # # this is where I need to be # # here is mine # # here is there # # just across the line # # this is where I choose to be # # I just need some time # - Former charles manson follower lynette "squeaky" fromme... - Brian. - What? - For attempting to assassinate president ford. - Look at you. You look like who did it and ran. What are you doing down there in that basement? - Working on a cure for dandruff. - You spend too much time down there, smart-ass. - Did they say why she did it? - What, there has to be a reason? You kids are all crazy, out of control. - Ma, what are you doing to that thing? - Cleaning it. - I thought it was broken. You were throwing it out. - I am. - So why are you cleaning it? - I can't put something this filthy out in the garbage. People will think we're pigs. - So you're cleaning the garbage? - Just eat and mind your own business. - You know, you should really meet my friend jerry. You guys both have a similar healthy respect for garbage. Shit. I don't understand how you can make food that's hotter than actual flame. - It's good for you that way. - Yeah, if you live on the sun. Where's dad? - Where do you think? - Parenting seminar? - Look... I had two detectives here last night looking for your brother. Thank god your father wasn't here. - What did they want? - They wouldn't tell me. You know anything about this? - No. - I couldn't trust you guys when I'm at work to stay out of trouble. Now I've got cops coming to my door. I don't know what to do with the pair of you. - What did I do? - I don't know, but there's something going on down in that basement. Don't make me have to come down there after you. - Ma, there's nothing going on down in the basement. - Don't you talk back to me. - You just stay the hell out of there. That's all. I find out you're doing drugs down there, I swear, I'll break your legs. - Well, what do you think we should do, huh? What's your big idea? - You've got to fire half of them. I'm telling you. - You looking for danny? Who are you? - I'm his brother. - You're his partner in crime? It's all right. I'm the fella your brother sells to. There's some nice bulk liquor coming my way. - You're jimmy cheeks? - Maybe so, but nobody's fucking stupid enough to call me that to my face. - I'm very sorry, mr. Cheeks. - You work for whitey, right? How come he can afford to pay you; he can't afford to pay me? - You're the one that whitey owes? - Don't ask so many fucking questions, huh? If you're looking for danny, he's picking up his friend ray. - Prison-guy ray? Oh, sorry, another question. - Well, he ain't good-samaritan ray. That's for sure. Danny's meeting him at rikers island right now, giving him a ride home. Your brother is good that way. He'd give you the shirt off his back. - Okay, well, when he comes back, can you tell him that I came by? It's important. - Yes, I will write that down right now. - Right, okay. Well, thanks for all your help. - I don't know. - I'm telling you, nights are better. - Yeah, yeah. - People tip better when they're going out for dinner and stuff like that. What are you doing here? - It's nice to see you too. I just came by to tell you that the stones are gonna play the lafayette on the 28th, and I wanted to invite you. - The rolling stones. - No, the kidney stones. Yes, the rolling stones. You coming? - Why would the rolling stones play brooklyn? - What is it with you people? You act like brooklyn is some sort of fucking hick town. It's the fourth-biggest city in the country. - Brooklyn is not a city. - If it was, it would be. - Yeah, well, the rolling stones are gonna take one look at the lafayette and have their 20th nervous breakdown. - Shit, I can't get no. - No what? - Satisfaction. You coming or what? - I'll be gone by then. - That's too bad. You don't work on sundays, do you? - Work from home. - Come on. - I'm serious. I read up on airline deals. Got to know what I'm doing backwards and forwards before I get to I. A... It's not just a little store like this. It's, like, five times as big. - Just take two hours off. We'll go somewhere, just a walk. - Same category as lunch? - Exactly, it's harmless, healthy, and this particular walk will be historically educational. - Brian, why do you want to do this? I'm leaving in a few weeks. - I didn't say we had to go pick out curtains, shauna. I'm talking about a walk. - No. - If no, just say no. - I say no every time I see you. - Would you make up your mind? Look, if you don't like it, all you got to do is avoid me for a couple of weeks, and you're in the clear. - And if I do like it? - Well, then, we'll make a mutual suicide packet. - All right, tomorrow. - Tomorrow, uh... Not available. Kidding. - There he is. Join me in some fucking pussy. - Dah-dah-dah. Watch. Check it out. Check it out. Uhh, you got to- you got to make it sharp. - That's a small dick you got there. - Hey, there he is. It's vincent van faggot. - I've been looking all over for you. - You and everybody else. - The cops have been coming around asking questions. - No shit. There you go. - The detectives talked to mom. - No one's looking for you, if that's what you're worried about. - That's not what I'm worried about. - This is my little brother. Fucking spends hours and hours down here by himself painting drawings, while the rest of us are out drinking and getting laid. He wants to draw pictures for a living, except he ain't got the balls to admit it to anybody. - Get the fuck out. - What are you gonna do, tell mommy? You don't have to worry. No one even touches you, this little fuck. He's a good boy. Me, I sneeze too fucking hard, I catch a fucking beating. - What do you want? - I came to get my shoe box. - It's in my room. - All right. - Get out. - Ohh, don't be upset, little boy. I just want to put some color on your cheeks. - You fucking asshole. I'm gonna fucking kill you. You fuck! - You mother... You fucking raise your hand, you better be ready to finish it. You hear me? - You fucking jack me? You fucking jack me? You're fucking dead. You motherfucker. You're fucking dead. You're fucking dead. You're fucking dead. You piece of shit. You're fucking dead. You hear me, you scumbag? You're gonna fucking die for that. Get the fuck out of here. All right. All right. Little fucker! - Danny. Danny! I hear noises. - It's just a storm. - Does the thunder mean god's mad? - Yeah, but not at us. We're okay here. Hey, look. Watch this. - Well, I guess this is historic. - Hey, anybody can take you on a walk through prospect park. - Ah, but a cemetery. Now, that's class. You gonna tell me what happened to your face? - Oh, I was practicing for this walk, and I fell. - Shit, brian, who did that? Look, don't bullshit me. Who did that to you? - My brother. - Your brother. - It's no big deal. It's nothing new, except this time, I hit him back. - You guys need a new hobby. - All families fight, I guess. - Not mine, not like that, anyway. - There's always been plenty of hand-to-hand combat in our house. Me and my brother used to stay up at nights and listen to my parents. We'd give them a number on the temper scale. - My parents never raised a hand to me, fight with silence, cold shoulder. Well, maybe that's worse. - So you've never been hit? - No. - Not by anybody? - No. - Wow. - I knew who you were, you know. I remembered you from high school. - Why didn't you say something? - I used to see you in the halls, cafeteria, sometimes on the train, always just watching everything. And I used to- I used to try to figure out, "now, what's this guy thinking?" - Me too. - I remember one time in the school yard, you were getting your ass kicked by brother dominic. - Gentle friar. - He had you by the hair, and he slapped you till you fell down. But you never made a sound. You just took it, and your face was so red, and your shirt was coming out of your pants, but you didn't even cry, kept your dignity. Brother dominic lost his. You know, they got a cemetery just like this in paris. - You been to paris? - Oh, I've been all over. When I got out of travel school, we took these familiarization trips, "fam trips," they call them. Some travel agent, they've never even been anywhere. You know, the girls I work with, forget it. How can you do that? I mean, how can you send people all around the world, and you've never even been out of your own freakin' neighborhood. - That sounds like the perfect job for you. - It's a good future too. People are always gonna be going places, and there are always gonna be travel agents to book it. I've been to london. I've been to rome. I was even in alaska once. I'm gonna go all around the world by the time I'm 25. - I was in piscataway, new jersey, last year. I ate like a king. - Don't you want to travel? I mean, don't you want to walk down the street and know that when you turn the corner, it's all gonna be new? - I like it here. Why do I always feel like I have to apologize for it? - Can I tell you something, brian? Cemetery, all this death around us... Really makes me horny. Don't ask me why. - I wasn't gonna. - I was at a wake once for my uncle. Mm, I was climbing the walls. - Do you dare me to run naked through this cemetery? - I don't know if I dare you, but I might beg you. - I'm not gonna do it alone. Oh, come on, brian, nobody here. Just a bunch of dead people. - Might I point out that it's a bit chilly? - Ahhh! - Keep your eye on me, baby. Whoo. # Ooh, ooh, yeah # # I've been down so low, I got nowhere to go # # don't you know I've been a little down on my luck # # I've been a little bit stuck # # I've been down low down, but things are sure lookin' up # # well, I have some money, and I have me a wife # # I had a sweet life, and then those times got tough # # she done gave me up # # I've been down low down, but things are sure lookin' up # # yes they are # # yeah, well, I'm looking up, can't you see # # baby I'm movin' up, look at me # # I'm comin' up, yeah, it's me # # I said I've had enough # # I'm breaking free # # from where I stand, baby, things are sure lookin' up # - What is this place, anyway? - Belongs to the deli upstairs. They let me hang out here. - Did you do all these? They're beautiful. Watercolor? - Yeah. And some charcoal, some just pencil. - Why are the people so blurry? - Maybe they don't know who they are. - I like this one the best. What is that? - It's just woods. My brother used to take me camping when we were kids... Back when he liked me. - And you don't show these to anybody? - Like who? - I don't know. I just- it just doesn't seem right to keep all of this hidden away down here. If I could do this, I would never shut up about it. - Well, you never shut up anyway. - I'm serious. I mean, this makes you special. Don't you know that? - You think so? - Yeah. - Well, it's, like, a hobby, really. I mean, it's not like I could make a living out of it. - It's more than that, and you know it. Why are you so afraid of it? I better go. - What's the matter? - Nothing. I've just got to go. That's all. - What, do I need a breath mint or something? - I can't see you anymore, brian. You're a really great guy and all, but I just can't, and don't come by the store, and don't call. Just-just let it go, okay? Sorry. - Excuse me. Come on. God damn it. Son of a bitch. Ugh. Jesus christ. What the hell is this? Hey, maggie. What the hell is this, huh? The mailbox is crammed with this. You ever check the mail ever? - Every day. What are you talking about? - Every day? That is bullshit. There's 9,000 bills, junk mail. God knows how long it's been sitting in there. - You're gonna have to do better than this, paddy, if you want to fight. I empty the mailbox every day. - That is bullshit, and I'll tell you something. This is the reason that we're late with the bills every month. - We're late with every bill because you drink half the money every week. That's why we're late with the bills. - That's why? All right, I'll tell you what. How about this month, we have no bills at all, huh? What do you say? There, look, no bills at all. How about that? Yeah? How about that? How about that, huh, margaret? - What the hell is wrong with you? - You happy now? - Jesus... Christ. - Your garbage can get out of town. This is gonna be the cleanest fucking neighborhood that you ever saw, and if the christmas hits are right, it's gonna stay that way. - Another dedicated public servant heard from. - Mock though you will. Just remember, certain people are wasting their lives in college, while I'm pulling down 10 gs a year. - Yeah, you'll be pulling something. - Brian. I told you he'd be here. It's like when the swallows return to captain strano. - Hey, shorty. Can you put these up somewhere where people can see them? - What am I, your own personal billboard? - Hey, do we get a discount to this concert, or what? - Who says you're invited? - Oh, look, he's hobnobbing with the showbiz crowd. He doesn't need us no more. - You guys seen todd? - Look at this. I stand before him in the uniform of my chosen profession, and you can only ask about college boy? - Some people just don't get excited over garbage, jerry. - You passed the physical. - Yeah. - They had to give him oxygen. - Only for an hour... Once I stopped crying. - That's great, jerry. - Not only did I make it, but I made it in the top ten percentile. How about that, college boy? - The man knows garbage. - The man eats garbage. - So will you if your house is on my route, you fuck. - As long as you're on the job, jerry, why don't you take care of this? - Hey. - Oh, wow, look. It's my first bag of garbage, and it came from you. - No, most of it came from you. - New york city department of sanitation coming through. Hot garbage here, hot garbage. - Doing all right? - Yeah, how about you? - Yeah. Hey, listen, I... I heard this somewhere. I don't even remember where now, like, maybe on tv or something, that when you hear back from a college, if they send you a thick envelope, it means that you got in, and if they send you a skinny one, it means that you didn't. Is that true? - Usually, a thick one is yes. They send you all sorts of forms and paperwork and shit. The thin one is no, straight to the point. - That's what I thought. - It's all right. Don't worry. No, we're good. We're good. Come on. - Whoa. - You all right? Come on. Here. There we go. - What? - What? - Just trying to picture your brother doing this. That's all. Probably shit in his pants by now. - He's been with me before. He could do it if he had to. - Bullshit. That kid's a faggot through and through. - Who the fuck are you to say that? - What? - What the fuck do you know about my brother? - I know he's a pussy. Everybody knows that. - You keep your fucking mouth shut about brian. - What? I saw you call him a fag to his face, and you were right. - I can say what I want about my brother. You fucking can't. What motherfuck... - Fucking step here, danny. You know where I've been the last eight fucking months? I've cut guys for a lot less than that. - Fuck you. I don't give a fuck where you been. You fucking pull a knife on me, you better use it quick, you little cunt. - On your feet. Let me see your hands. Let's see both hands. All right, stay right there. Keep 'em up. - I can't take a pinch, danny. I'm on parole. I could do hard time. - Keep your hands up. - Tell them I mugged you. I dragged you in the alley. I tried to take your money. - I got my gun on me, all right? I'm fucked anyway. - Thanks, danny. - Don't you ever fucking come near me again. - What are you assholes doing here? - Yeah, that's right. He's my son. What for? Where? What precinct? Sergeant mckeene, yeah. Thank you, yeah. Yes. Brian. Brian! Brian. Damn it. Brian! Brian. Damn it, brian! Brian. Brian! Brian. Brian! Brian. Didn't I tell you not to come down here? Didn't I? What the hell are you doing down here? Your brother's been arrested. You better go get your father. - So when she gets home, she's wearing a- like, a mouse. Anyway, he says, "jesus, katie. What the hell happened to you?" And she said, "I don't know. "I asked mrs. Garber, I said, "'mrs. Garber, what's a specimen? ' "And she told me to go piss in a bottle. "So I told her to go shit in her hands, and that's when the fight started. " - I'll see ya. - Pop. - What's the matter? - It's danny. He's down at the 68th precinct. They arrested him. - What did he do? Son of a bitch. Get in the car. - Just so you know... Just so you know, that was my christmas money I bailed you out with. - You'll get your money back. Don't worry about it. - Yeah? I'm gonna get my money back? What, are you gonna mug somebody with a gun? You're a fucking thief now? I should have let you rot in there. - I didn't ask you to bail me out. - Yeah, well, it's the last time, never again. Look, you don't come home tonight, huh? I don't want you in the house now. I don't want you there ever. You hear me? - Okay by me. - Fucking bum is what you are. That's what you turned out to be, a fucking bum. You understand? - Takes one to know one. - What did you just say? - Nothing. - What did you just say to me? - Dad, stop. Get off him. - Hit me. Go ahead. Hit me. - Hey, you didn't knock me down, all right? I slipped. You remember that. You did not knock me down. - So what. My old man hit me ten times harder than I ever hit you, and I didn't go down neither, huh? You coming? - No. Whitey won't show up till noon, so we're good till then. Get some blankets and shit from the house, and we got soap and all in the men's room. - Have to give that one a ten, huh? - North. - You know I haven't been in here since I was a kid? Old man used to take me. I remember we saw the dirty dozen. He loved that one, pop. - Remember, he used to take us on walks across the brooklyn bridge? - Yeah, yeah, and we'd take the train back, right? First car, so we could look down the tracks. - I don't know why he hits you and not me. - Who knows? He probably don't even know. That's just the way it is. That's all. I keep having this dream. He hauls off to let me have it, and I clock him. I hit him so fucking hard. He looks at me like he can't believe it. And I hit him again. He goes down like a rock. He looks up at me... Knows he can never hit me again. Maybe someday I'll have the balls to do it. - What are you gonna do now? What's whitey charging for the stones? - $50... Cash at the door, no advance. - What you got here, like, 600 seats? - Give or take. Why? - That's 30 grand cash just sitting here that night. - No way, danny. No. - We can do this. You know where the money's gonna be. You know how to get it. - This is whitey we're talking about here. - Whitey's not family. We're family. - Shit, danny. - What are you gonna do? You gonna stay here the rest of your life? You gonna be an audience? You gonna be the guy who watches what other people do? We can get out of here and go somewhere and live real fucking lives, do what we want to do, not just see if we can get through a fucking day without getting hit. - You really think that it's possible? - Yeah, and we've got to take it. No one's gonna give it to us. I need this, brian. You need it. - I don't know much about this kind of thing. They said they were the best. As long as your father burns bills, I figured, what the heck? I want you to tell danny to come back home. - Danny's leaving. Me too. He hurt him bad, ma. - I won't let him do that anymore. - What are you gonna do, reason with him? - Look, your father's not easy. I know this. But there's good in there. I know you don't see it, but I do. I remember things, things you don't even know about, things that happened before you were born. Thing are not all one way, brian. He knows how hard it is out there. He's trying to teach your brother how to be a man, and you too. - You really believe that, ma? Why do you stay with him? - Where am I gonna go? I don't need anybody feeling sorry for me. I made my choice, like the church says, for better or for worse. - I don't see anyone from the church here when he comes home drunk. - Don't talk that way about your religion. And watch what you say about him. He's still your father. - He doesn't like to keep cash in the box office. He always moves it to his office in the back of the theater. - Who takes care of it? - Me, usually. He'll probably have me taking it back there every ten minutes or so. - What's near the office, doors, a window? - There's a door right next to the stairs that go backstage. - Can you make sure that's open? So the concert starts at 9:00, so by 10:00, all the cash that's gonna be there, should be there, right? - I guess. - So by 10:00, you've got to make sure whitey's not backstage, okay? Keep him busy in the lobby. I'll get through the door, find the office, grab the cash. You meet me back here at 10:30. - You should at least say good-bye to mom. - Danny. Look at me. Look at me, danny. I'm sorry what he did to you. - I'm all right. - What kind of trouble are you in? - Look, I've got to give something to pop. Then I've got to get out of here. - He's sleeping it off. You don't want to wake him. Trust me. Let me make you guys something to eat, okay? I've got some sloppy joes on the stove, okay? It will just take a second. Go-just sit down, and I'll bring it right out, okay? Brian, you got a phone call before. - I did? - Yeah, some guy, lynn burger or lam burger or some kind of "burg"... Carnegie dally. - From carnegie mellon? - Whatever. I wrote his number down on the napkin holder. - Ma. Tell pop this is the money I owe him. - Ahhh. - Oh, come on. Just put it down and let it cool off. - You need the iceberg that sunk the titanic to cool this off; Let me tell you. - So what are you, mr. Gourmet all of a sudden, food critic from the brooklyn spectator? - So do you use, like, an actual flamethrower... - I'll give you a flamethrower. - No, not the towel. - You gave me a good scare there, boy. Yeah, I didn't think he was gonna make it. I heard your head hit the ground and went out like a light. He was out cold. - My head didn't hit the ground. I told you, you never- - sure as hell did. I heard it hit the ground, and all of a sudden, pop. The sprinklers by the... The... What the hell do you call it, maggie? You know, the kiddie pool. You mean... You mean, when he was a kid? - Must have slipped or something. I don't know. - He doesn't remember that, paddy. He was five or six. - You went down, and you didn't move. And I run over, and I picked you up, and just as limp as a... Like a rag doll. You was white as a sheet. And I had you in my arms, and I ran all the way to the hospital. I run in the emergency room, and you wasn't moving, wasn't even breathing, and I'm... And I'm holding, you know, and I look down at you, and you're so small, so still, and just there for that minute, oh, I hated you. And I thought you was gonna die. I thought you was dead already, maybe. And I said to you, "don't you die. "Don't you go and make me... "Care like this and then go die on me. " And then they took you away from me, and everybody starts running around, and they're doing whatever it is that they're doing, and they made me go outside, and I yelled at them. I said to them, "you give me my boy back. You give me back my little boy. " Yeah, you gave me a good scare there, danny boy. - Paddy. Go back to bed. - Ehh... - Let me take you back to bed. It's all right, paddy. It's all right. - Thanks for getting back to me. I sent you a letter. - Yeah, I didn't really get a chance to read it. - Well, people don't usually send us polaroids of their work. We wrote to tell you that you have to send in an application. - Um- - the stones want a wah-wah pedal. What the fuck is that? - I don't know. Ask one of those guys. - Pain in the ass. - Right, application. I don't know. - The thing is, I've had these polaroids up on my bulletin board here, and a lot of people are commenting on them, and I see by your zip code that you might qualify for some hefty student- - I'm not underprivileged. - Okay, I understand. What school are you in now? - Um... University of lafayette. - Mm-hmm, don't know it. Anyway, I'd like to send you an application. We think this could be a good fit. - Look, those pictures, I just sent them because I was curious. It wasn't, like, a serious thing. - I'm not sure I understand. Brian? - Same to me or anyone else. I'm making you a promise right here. If I don't have all my money by noon tomorrow, I will come back here and burn this fucking theater to the ground and you along with it, understand? Say yes, whitey. Say yes. - Whitey? Hey! Hey! - It's okay, kid. I'll be right with you. - Next time you see me, I will not be talking. You came along just in time. Scared me off, you did. - You okay? - You kidding? I had him right where I wanted him. Come on. Don't give me that look. I got this all under control. After tonight, I'm gonna be in the clear. Come here. I got something for you. It's gonna get busy tonight, so I wanted to give you this before I forget. I put $1,500 in there for you, just for you, 'cause you help me out a lot here. - You don't have to do this, whitey. - No, I do. Really, I do. Jimmy cheeks will get his, believe me, so I put aside for you. - I don't know what to say. - Well, that's a first. - I don't deserve it. - Don't say that. You're a good kid, brian. You can't hide it. If you were my son, I'd be nothing but proud. Anyway, we have a lot to do for tonight. After lunch, we've got to find some kind of dressing room for these guys. I hear they're fussy bastards. We got ten kegs of beer coming at 4:00. Make sure you're here, ya little shit. - I'm not gonna do it. I just can't, danny. I'm sorry. - What's the matter? - I can't rob whitey. I wish I could be like you. I really do. I wish I had your balls. I wish I wasn't so fucking afraid of everything. I wish- no matter how hard I try, I'm never gonna be like you, danny, and you're always gonna hate me for that. - I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Yes, you do. You do. - Brian, you're my brother. - I know. Can't that be enough, just that? Take this. It will get you out of here, at least get you set up somewhere else. Don't rob whitey, danny. You can do something else. It doesn't have to be this. - I wish I could do what you do, make something out of nothing, instead of always the other way around. - I've been thinking a lot about the tent lately, about you and me camping. Sometimes I wish it could be simple like that again. - I'll see ya. - Danny. I'm sorry I jacked you that time. - Don't be. I never took you camping, you asshole. - It's gonna be good. - How are we doing? - They're still not here? - They're on their way. Pete called; Look out for a limo the size of new jersey. Here, I'll cover for you. Put that in the office, okay? Okay, how many? - Two. - Two, okay. - Come in. Have fun. Enjoy the show. - Look like you're gonna have a good crowd, whitey. Too bad it's for "1 nit only. " With all the money I spotted you, maybe you could have bought a few es. - A couple of es. Yeah, I should get some es. I'm gonna get some es. Vip. How many? - Hey, hump. - Where the fuck have you guys been? - Is mick here? Did he ask for me? - Yeah, he wants to know who the fat fuck is who's gonna block his spotlight. - They're not here yet, and what the fuck is that? - What? - What do you mean, what? You look like you've got a camel strapped to your chest. Ohhhh. - Guys, we've got, like, 9,000 kegs of beer in there. - Yes, but that would involve an exchange of currency. - Yeah, unless you can also arrange for a student by platis. - You mean gratis, asshole? - Okay, you guys, just sit somewhere and try not to fucking embarrass me. - Okay, one ticket, $50. Thanks very much. Have a good time. Come on in. I.D., ladies? Just kidding. Come on in. Come on in. Very good. Thanks, very much. How many, one? One, $50, a ticket. Here we go. No checks. - I can't believe we're almost there. - I know. - Ahh. - Good thing we got here early. - Just one? The world's gone mad, I tell ya. One ticket. Thanks, very much. Okay, there's your change. One? One for you. All right, very good. Ladies, ladies, come on. Time's a-wasting. How many? Two? - Yes. - Oh, there you go. Come on in. Come on in. Enjoy the show. Enjoy the show. - Thanks. - How many? Just one? This is very sad, very sad. Go in. Meet a boyfriend. You'll have fun. - I can't believe we're almost there. Ahh. - We sold out. I just locked the doors. They're three blocks away. - You're drinking the beer that I brought in. - Get the fuck out of here with that commie shit. - Oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey. Thank you. Love you. - I told you that we do not do pills. We do not. - No, I got it. No. - Thought you'd be gone. - Um, long story. - I wish I had known. I would have let you in the vip entrance. So what happened? Your trip get postponed or something? - Yeah, it's just temporary. Thank you for the gift. - You liked it? - Nobody ever did anything like that for me before. - So just out of curiosity, what did I do to scare you off? - You didn't do anything, anything you could help, anyway. - Here. - Oh, thanks. You know, when my mother was my age, she was married already. She didn't really want to be, but she met my father. She just fell in love with him right away. She had all these plans. You know, she was gonna go work for the airlines, and she wanted to be a stewardess, but she just couldn't help herself. She was, like, 20 when they got married. I never thought you could feel like that about somebody so soon like that. You know, like, enough to want to give up everything else. I just couldn't let anything like that happen to me. - Would that be the worst thing in the world, to stay here with someone you like? - I'll see you later. - Yeah! - Come on, mick. Come on, stones. Let's go. Come on, stones. - Fucking bullshit! - You're not gonna get away with this. - Give me my fucking money! - You're not gonna get away with this. - Who's running this joint? - That's the little prick who works here. - Where's our money? Give us back our fucking money. - Hey, hey, hey. I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened. - Where's our money? Give us back our money. - Get out of the way. Get out of the way. - You're fucking dead. - Look, I don't know what happened. - Get out of my way. Get the fuck back. Hey! Hey, brian! Brian. Brian, I'm coming for you. - I got you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Get away. Get the fuck off me. Get off me. Come on. - You're bleeding. What'd they fucking do to you? - You all right? - What the fuck? - Fuck. Danny, no. No, danny, danny. Danny, danny. It's okay. It's okay. Danny, danny, danny, danny. - It fucking hurts. - No, no, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't take it out. Don't take it out. Don't take it out. Don't take it... Fuck... No, no, no, no, no. Help! Danny. Danny! Nooo! Danny! - Shh, it's all right. It's just a storm. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. - Don't leave me. Don't leave me here. - I'm not going anywhere. Nothing bad is ever gonna happen to you. I'm gonna make sure. I'm not leaving. - Eternal rest grant unto him, oh, lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and the souls of all the faithfully departed through the mercy of god rest in peace. Into your hands, oh, lord, we humbly entrust our brother, daniel. In this life, you embraced him with your tender love. Deliver him now from every evil- - don't take away my son, please. Don't take away my boy. It should be me. It should be me, danny. - Pat. - Take me. Take me. Please, give me back my little boy. Danny. - Come on, pat. - It will be all right, pat. - Easy. It's okay. It's okay. We got you. - You okay? - Tell you the truth, I had a lot more fun last time I was here. I'm glad I got to see you before you leave. - I'm not going to I. A... They gave that job to somebody else. - Shit. Shauna, I'm sorry. So you hook up somewhere else. - Mm-hmm. - All the experience you got, all the places you've been, no problem. - I never been anywhere, brian. Never really been out of brooklyn, and now I'll never get out. - It's okay. Come on out now. You okay? You're not scared anymore? - It's all right. He got it out of his system. Just make sure you're both asleep before he comes back. You okay? Can I... Can I get you something? - How's pop? - Asleep. - What is this? Camp rockaway. When your brother was a kid, we thought it would be a good idea to send him to summer camp. You know, let him get some fresh air, trees, things like that. Your father saved up for it all year, but danny... Danny didn't want to go. No way. Took him to the bus anyhow. I was determined. L-oh, he cried. He-he-he held on to me. He-he begged me not to make him go. He... He even promised he'd be good all summer. So I took him back home. I don't know if I did it for him or for me, but I couldn't bring myself to put him on that bus, and to this day, I'm sorry I didn't. It would have been so good for him, would have given him a chance to see what he could do out there in the world. The thing is, he wasn't strong enough to go. And I should have been strong enough to make him go. - The stones come to brooklyn. Pretty fucking stupid, huh? - Hey, it could have happened. - No, it couldn't. - Think they'll ever find whitey? - I hope not. He really pulled it off. He rented all the equipment, the whole nine yards. Even jimmy cheeks thought the stones were coming. - Everybody's wondering if you knew. - No. I probably should have, but... I always believed everything he said. Are you going back to pittsburgh tomorrow? - Yeah, classes start next week, so... - Yeah. How long you think it will take to get there? You all right? - They even have travel agents in pittsburgh? - I wouldn't worry. I have a feeling people in pittsburgh really like getting out of pittsburgh every once and a while. - We've got a stop to make. - Been a long time since I've seen you around here. - I just came by to tell you I'm leaving. - Yeah, your mother told me. Going to school to draw pictures. - Gonna try. - Any good at it? - Looks that way. - Make a living with it? - I don't know. - You, uh, need any money or anything? - No, I just came to say good-bye. - Well... I guess you said it.
