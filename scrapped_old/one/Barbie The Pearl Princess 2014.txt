 

                        1 [GASPS] [BLOWING] [GIGGLES] [GIGGLES] With the power vested in me by nobody in particular... ...I hereby crown you Princess Kuda, ruler of the seven seas. [GIGGLES] [SHELLS CLANGING] [WHISTLING] Oh, thank you. Thank you, my loyal subjects. [LUMINA GIGGLES] Ladies and jellyfish, let us celebrate my coronation... ...with a royal ball. Let joy be unconfined! May I have this dance, milady? Charmed, I'm sure. [CLANGING AND SQUEAKING] [GIGGLES] SCYLLA: Lumina? -Aah. LUMINA: Uh-oh. -Aah! Lumina? Lumina. What was that commotion? LUMINA: Um... Oh, we were just playing coronation, Aunt Scylla. Were you using your pearl magic outside? Um... Well, maybe, just a little. Lumina, I've told you and told you... ...keep your powers private. -Powers private. I know, Aunt Scylla. I'm sorry, really. You have a very special gift... ...but if word got out-- Well, all kinds of bad people might come looking for you. But I don't understand. Who's gonna see me way out here? You don't need to understand. Please, just do as I say. [KUDA GASPS] Hello, Kuda. KUDA: Hi, Aunt Scylla. Ha, ha. Ah. Great. Now your aunt's mad. And I've got clam dents in my head. Oh, you look fine. Hmm. Except for your hair. Uh-oh. [GRUNTS] LUMINA: Hmm. Uh-uh. [GRUNTS] Hmm. No. Still not right. [GASPS] LUMINA: I think that's the one. Let's see. You need something to wear. [KUDA GASPS] [KUDA SCREAMING] There. Now you look like a princess. [SNAPS FINGERS] [GIGGLES] Hmm? And now we both look like princesses. [LUMINA SIGHS] I wonder what a real princess looks like. KU DA: Yeah. And the royal castle. LUMINA: And all the beautiful mermaids and their elegant clothes. Can you imagine the dances they must have there? Kuda, you think we'll ever really get to see the castle? Maybe. Someday. I bet it's just the most wonderful place ever. I bet everyone there is happy all the time. CALIGO: Your Gracious Majesties. All I ask is that you consent to appear in public just one night. Your subjects need you. Your kingdom needs you. Dare I say it... ...I need you. Caligo, as I've told you many times, Queen Lorelei and I-- Of course, of course. And like you... ...I am inconsolable over the lost princess. But we simply must face the fact... ...that with you and the queen having no heir... ...the kingdom will one day pass to your nephew, my son. Hello, Neocrinus decorus. And how are we today? Aah! [FERGIS CHUCKLES] I'm afraid Caligo is right. Perhaps it is time. Excellent! And since he'll also need to choose a suitable wife... ...we'll give a royal ball. We'll invite only the most beautiful... ...and eligible young mermaids of the kingdom... ...for a chance to be my son's queen. FERGIS: Huh? Aah! [GRUNTING] Aah, aah, aah... [SNEEZES] [WHIMPERS] Oh. Perhaps we should invite all the maidens. And throw in a door prize. Whoa. Ugh. [LAUGHS] MURRAY: Yoo-hoo! Hmm. Aah! Oh, dear me. Did I frighten you? Ha-ha-ha. Who are you? What do you want? I go by many names, but you may call me Murray. I come bearing an eel-mail from an old friend of yours, Caligo. Hey! Gut! [MURRAY SNICKERING] I admit tracking you down was a particular challenge. But my Bottom Feeders Network came through. All right, you've found me. What is it you want? Ah, that famous hag hospitality. A simple request, really. My employer is once again in need of your, urn, professional services. Services? What services? Caligo convinced His Majesty to open up the castle for a royal ball... ...at which time the king will confer the Pearl of the Sea medallion... ...onto Caligo's son. His Majesty will then toast the boy from a cup of merberry nectar. - Which Caligo wants me to poison. -Exactly. The king croaks, the son is crowned, everybody wins. Well, maybe not the king. Don't you love a happy ending? Well, you can tell your employer that I'm no longer in the poisoning business. So unless you're interested in buying... ...some gill glistener or scale brightener, get out! He said you'd say that. I am, therefore, authorised to issue the following threat: Do it or I'll tell everyone you killed the princess. Ha-ha-ha. You wouldn't dare. He said you'd say that too. I am, therefore, authorised to respond: Would so. Fine. If it's poison Caligo wants, it's poison he'll get. A wise decision. Here, you'll need this invitation to the ball. We'll leave the sordid details in your expert hands. After all, it's really all in the execution... ...wouldn't you agree? [SNICKERS] Now, don't be late, 8 p.m., Saturday, at the castle. LUMINA: Castle? -Huh? What about the castle? [GASPS] Well, well. And who is this? - Hmm. -Hi. I'm Lum-- - Late again for dinner. -Aah! Our guest was just leaving. But, Aunt Scylla... Aunt Scylla? I assumed you lived alone. - Maybe I should-- -You assumed wrong. Get out! Aah! [GRUNTING] Hmm. Aunt Scylla. KU DA: Hey! [SCOFFS] What was your friend talking about? Did he mean the royal castle? Are you going there? Can I go? Can I go? Can I go? - Please? -Lumina. I heard it has golden doors and pearl chandeliers... ...and a beautiful throne, and it must be wonderful. And I've always wanted to go there, and so does Kuda. Absolutely not. I've told you how dangerous the journey is. I do it to sell my potions, but it's far too risky for a young girl alone. But I wouldn't be alone. I'd have you. And Kuda. And burning fire coral... ...and vampire squid and poisonous stonefish. Lumina, neither of you has ever been an inch outside this reef. Believe me... ...you wouldn't last two seconds, even with me to keep an eye on you. - But-- -it's out of the question. Uh, I think that's a "no." I kind of stopped listening after vampire squid. SCYLLA: Now, you be good. I'll be back in a few days. And please, both of you, stick close to home. Mm-hm. That's a good girl. Bye! SCYLLA: Goodbye. [LUMINA SIGHS] I guess we're never gonna get to see the castle, Kuda. [WHIMPERS] Hey, Wanna play tail tag? Huh? - You're it. -Heh. [GASPS] Huh? Hmm. What's this? It's an invitation. She's not just going to the castle. She's invited to a royal ball. And she can't get in without this. Huh? Aunt Scylla! You forgot your--! Hmm. Kuda, we really should bring this to her, don't you think? No, I don't think. Well, after all, she'll need it to get into the ball. So when you think about it... ...it's really our duty to go after her. All the way to the castle if we have to. Lumina, no! She'll be furious. Were you listening to Scylla? - The dangerous journey? -Psh. You mean the burning whatchamacallit and the poisonous thingamapoo? It was the burning fire coral and poisonous stonefish. Don't you see? This is our big chance. Oh, Kuda, we've got to go. We've just got to. But-- But-- But-- But-- But-- But-- This has to be the right way. [KU DA G ROAN S] I've seen Aunt Scylla head this way every time she goes to town. BOTH: Unh. LUMINA: It's a dead end. Oh, darn. Oh, well, that's that. We gave it our best. Let's go home. Hmm. I just don't underst-- Huh? Lumina. Wait for me! Oh, look, an opening. I bet that's her shortcut through the coral. Follow me, Kuda. Don't be afraid. Make up your mind. I can't do both. Uh, Lumina, you do realise we're inside a someone, right? Come on, Kuda. I bet the end is right down here. Look at this. These are ribs. We're in a beast. A big, huge-- Uh-oh. [CRACKING AND CREAKING] Aah! [SCREAMS] This is not fun! Lumina! Swim! The invitation. [CREAKING] [GASPS] [KUDA SCREAMING] [LUMINA GRUNTING] Huh? Whoa! - Ha. Got it. -Ahh. Okay, let's go. [CRACKING] [KUDA GASPS] Oh, no. [KUDA WHIMPERING] KUDA: No, no, no! Oh, no! [LUMINA & KUDA SCREAMING] [LUMINA & KUDA GRUNTING] [KUDA SIGHS] Know any more handy shortcuts? Aah. Oh, no. The invitation, it's gone. There. All right. [LU MINA GAS PS] A narwhal? - Now what? -Come on, we just need to follow him. Here we go again. FERGIS: But, Father, do I have to go to the ball? CALIGO: Yes, Fergie, because it's being given for you. But I've told you, I don't want to be king. I want to be a botanist. Forget about plants. You're going to be king and that's the end of it, understood? Now, get back to your waltz lessons. - Yes, sir. -Hmph. Forgive me, Neocrinus decorus. Ah. The Pearl of the Sea medallion. - Soon it will be mine. -Miss me? Aah! I wish you'd stop doing that! He, he. Me too. But I don't think I can. Well? Did you find Scylla? I did, and she agreed to do it. Excellent. And once she's poisoned the king at the ball... ...then I will rise up in righteous fury... ...and finish off the old hag. Presto, I'm hailed as a national hero... ...and my son is crowned king of Seagundia. My, you have thought of everything. I make it my business to. And once my son is king, I will wield the real power in the kingdom. And now comes the hard part, finding someone to marry him. Perhaps you should talk to Scylla. You know, she has quite a lovely niece. Aah! CALIGO: Niece? Goodness me, did I fail to mention that? Blond, about 17 years old. Interesting coincidence, don't you think? What? I'm guessing that's a "yes." Murray... ...bring me that girl. I want to ask her a few questions. MURRAY: Ha-ha-ha. Uh-huh. [MURRAY CONTINUES SNICKERING] Hmm. KU DA: This forest goes on forever. And it's getting kind of dark. [KUDA WHIMPERS] KU DA: Hey. There! Quick, after him! LUMINA: Lights? The city. Lumina, wait up! - Whoa. LUMINA: Aah! [BOTH GASP] Huh? [SQUID SQUEAKING] [LUMINA GIGGLES] [SQUID SQUEAKING] [KUDA GIGGLES] [KUDA WHIMPERING] LUMINA: Oh, no. [KUDA WHIMPERING AND LUMINA GRUNTING] Aah! [SQUID SQUEAKS AND KUDA GASPS] Oh, no. Aah! Uh, Lumina? [GASPS] [KUDA SCREAMS] Huh? [KUDA PANTING] Move away from the rock. What? Move away from the rock. Why? [STONEFISH GRUNTS THEN GROWLS] Huh? [GROWLING] That's why. A stonefish. One of the most poisonous-- The most poisonous! Make that the most poisonous fish in the sea. That's right, lady. You are looking at the face of certain doom! Nice to meet you, Mr. Doom. That is one powerful voice you have. Aren't you gonna move it? I vote with him. Aren't you listening? [ROARING] Each one of my poisonous spikes means a terrible, horrible end. LUMINA: Hmm. There. Much prettier. Hmm? Huh? What? What have you done to me? Yeah, what have you done to him? I just de-spiked your spikes. Now no one needs to be scared of you. Oh. Great. Just great. Now what am I supposed to do? Just be nicer. Stop trying to frighten everyone. Get to know your fellow fish. Easy for you to say. But everyone runs from me. Once no one's afraid of you, I bet you'll have loads of friends. I don't know. It all seems wrong for a stonefish. And I'm not so good at friendliness. We're heading to the city. There's lots of fish there, Mr. Doom. You could practise being friendly on them. The name's Spike. - You don't mind me coming along? -I'd be honoured. And I'd be nervous. But I'll give it a shot. Candygram! Eel Scout cookies! [GARTH & WORMWOOD GIGGLING] [MURRAY SCOFFS] Aha. Garth, Wormwood. Let's go. Huh? Hmm. "Aunt Scylla. You left behind your invitation, so we're bringing it to you. See you at the castle. Love, Lumina." Hmm. Victims... ...never there when you need them. As long as I'm here... [SNIFFING] Uh-uh. [HUMMING] - Ha. -Ooh. He-he-he. [CHUCKLES] - Ooh. -Ha-ha-ha. - Ha. -Unh. Oh. Hmm. Ooh. Well, well, well. Hello. [MURRAY SNICKERING] And the remora said: "I don't have to outswim the shark. I just need to outswim you." [ALL LAUGHING] Huh? Aah. Help! Kelp! - Help! A Or "help"? SPIKE: Whoa. She swam right into a bed of snarly kelp. That stuff never lets go. [SCREAMING] Spike, quick! [SCREAMS] [KUDA WHIMPERS] Aah! [PANTS THEN SCREAMS] Hold still. You gotta hold still. [KUDA SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] Scylla was right. We'll never make it in one piece to the-- Huh? Aah! LUMINA: The castle. KU DA: Whoa. [HORN BLOWING AND SQUEAKING] LUMINA: Aah. SPIKE: Ooh. [LU MINA GAS PS] Ooh. Whoa. Look at the pretty dresses, Kuda. Ooh. [SPIKE WHIMPERING] KUDA: Huh? [LUMINA GIGGLES] Hey, out of the way! - Sorry! Unh. -Hah! - Excuse me. -Tourists. Boy, everyone's in such a big hurry. Where did Spike go? LUMINA: Spike, will you please stop hiding? You have nothing to worry about. Okay. But now you're gonna hear some real yelling and screaming. Hey, love your pearls. You do? Oh, yeah. Great look. That colour is great on you. [BOTH GIGGLE] Lumina, look. It's your Aunt Scylla. But we don't have the invitation. Oh, no, she's never gonna believe us. She'll be angry we left the reef. Well, I'll just explain that we were trying to help out and-- And you'll be grounded for a year. Come on. Wait. What about Spike? KUDA: He's doing fine. Quick. In here. [BOTH PANTING] MADAME RUCKUS: Oh, thank goodness. This way, sweetie. I'll get you set up. But I think you must have the wrong-- MADAME RUCKUS: So do y'all have references? Do you have a resume? Do you have a hairpin? Because my bun's coming undone. Can I get you a refreshment? Oh, Madame Ruckus. Now, are you sure this blush is right for the royal ball? Trust me, honey, that colour is you. That'll be 52.95, sugar. Shampoo! Heads up! Huh? Unh. Now, let's see what y'all can do. About what? [RINGING] MADAME RUCKUS: Hang on, sugar. Salon Du Mer. Madame Ruckus speaking. Uh-huh. You bet, ma'am. We can squeeze y'all in before the ball. Well, of course your eyes are all puffy, sugar. You need to put sea cucumbers on them every Tuesday. Mm-hm. - Bye-bye. BOTH: Huh? [PHONE RINGS] Salon Du Mer. Madame Ruckus speaking. Oh, I'm so sorry, we're completely booked on the Saturday. - Why, certainly. -Oh, Madame Ruckus. Hang on, honey, I can only do eight things at once. Lumina, this is our chance to leave. [GASPS] Oh, Scylla's coming. Uh, disguise hair. - Whew. -Argh. That was close. MADAME RUCKUS: Wow. You got the job. A job? I have a job. Uh, what's a job? But tell your friend the wig's not a good look. Huh? Aah! MADAME RUCKUS: And here's your first customer. Lunch break's at 1, we close at 5. By the way, what's your name, hon? Uh-- It's Lumina. KUDA: Okay, Scylla's gone. Let's get out of here. But I have a customer. Remember the royal castle? The reason we came here in the first place? You're right. But she needs me. Just look. [SCOFFS] We'll leave right after this, Kuda. Isn't it exciting? My first job. So you're the new stylist, huh? Well, newbie, I got two rules: Keep your hands out of my tip jar, and don't ever touch my lucky brush, okay? Tip jar? Don't let her scare you, honey. That's Sandrine... ...and she's half barracuda. Ha, ha. And this is Cora. She does nails and tails. Hi. I'm Lumina. This is my friend Kuda. Hi. We're just passing through. Well, it's nice to meet you anyway. Whoo, I am beat. [PHONE RINGS] Salon Du Mer. Of course. When would y'all like to come in, ma'am? Got it. Mm-hm. Can you do my hair like her? Well, okay, if you want. But you know what might look even better on you? I wanna look like her. Piece of advice, newbie. Just give them what they want. Trust me, they're all wearing the same hairstyle. Certainly, certainly. Mm-hm. [GASPS] Lumina. No. Hmm. Let me see your eyes. [KUDA GASPS] [GASPS] That is so totally awesome! I knew you'd like it. Like it? I love it! GIRL 1: Isn't that different! GIRL 2: It's wonderful. GIRL 3: I want something like that! -I can't believe it. Thank you. You're welcome. Ugh. Okay, so you got lucky. Nobody saw that. - Now can we go? -Next. I want my hairjust like you did hers. Are you sure? How about something special, just for you? Really? CALIGO: Have you briefed the men about the ball? Yes, sir. Don't worry, they know exactly what to do. Splendid. Everything is arranged. The rest is up to you. You will take the steward's place at the ball... ...and serve the merberry nectar to the royal party... ...including His Majesty. The king will present the Pearl of the Sea to my son... ...then drink the toast... ...then die. I have what you need. All that remains is to mix the brew. You rid me of one pest many years ago... ...now you'll rid me of another. Oh, by the way... ...I understand you have a niece. I have a goldfish too. What of it? Please, give my regards to both of them. That is amazing. [ALL GASPING] Kuda, I'm gonna need a lot more pearls. Huh? More pearls, more pearls. Always more pearls. CUSTOMER 1: Are you sure you can make my hair look like hers? Yeah, yeah, no worries. I could do that style in my sleep. You know, I've got an idea. How about I try something new? A little different? - Oh. No, no, I want-- -Hey. If she can do something different, so can I. - But I wanted-- -And you're gonna love it, understand? Uh, okay. What? CUSTOMER 2: Oh, look. Baby dolphins. That is so cute. I didn't even know you could do that. [CORA CHUCKLES] I never tried it before. They're gone? What do you mean she's gone? You know, gone. Vanished, abracadabra. Now she's here, now she's not. The place was empty. Blast! Hmm. Someone must have tipped her off. I don't think so. She left a note saying she was coming to the city. - And I found this. -Hmm. CAL I GO: The royal crest. Then it is her. That old hag double-crossed me. The princess is alive. And yet you don't seem overjoyed. This could ruin everything. We've got to get rid of her. Search high and low. Get all your slimiest, sleaziest, creepiest cronies together. Heh-heh. That's the only kind I know. And find that girl! [HORN BLOWING] [DOLPHIN CLICKING] I can't seem to make heads or tails of this map, Dolphin. [DOLPHIN SQUEAKS] [MADAME RUCKUS GRUNTING] DELPHIN: Ah. Perhaps this good woman can be of some assistance. - Excuse me, ma'am, but could you--? -Why, thanks. You're a doll. Just plop them down inside. I'll grab some more. [DOLPHIN SQUEAKS] Finally, the delivery's here. Did you bring some styling gel? Uh... Styling gel? Aha! Here it is. Sorry, heh-heh-heh, I'm afraid I'm a bit new to all this. It's okay. This is my first job too. I'm Lumina. Pleasure to meet you, Lumina. - I'm Delphin. -Dolphin? [DOLPHIN SQUEAKING] Now, now, how would she know? We've just met. It's Delphin. We get that a lot. [DOLPHIN SQUEAKING] I hope to see you again. [CORA CHUCKLES] He's handsome. Well, aren't you the lucky one? CALIGO: You're the new stylist in town? Yes, sir. Lumina. Whatever. I hear you're a miracle worker. Can you do something with this? [CHUCKLES] I'm sure I can. Good luck. You'd be the first. [FERGIS GASPS] Is that a Robena grandif/ora? Hmm. I'm not sure. Hey, Cora, what kind of plant is this? Um, green? Oh. She's beautiful. I'll introduce you when we're done. Ooh. Come on. [FERGIS GASPS] [LUMINA CLEARS THROAT] Hello, I'm Fergie. I'm Cora. - Do you like plants? CORA: Um... - I have a fern. -You do? Have you ever tried feeding it a mix of bone meal and phosphorus? It'll do wonders for the seedlings. Heh-heh. I'll give it a try. CALIGO: Fergie. Ladies, hold onto your hairpins. I've got bodacious news. I just ran into a dear old friend on the royal staff... ...and guess what she gave me. - An invitation? -To the royal ball? - Tonight? -For the whole salon staff. [ALL SCREAMING AND LAUGHING] I found more pearls, but I didn't have time to unwrap them. Kuda. The royal ball. At the castle. - Oh, no. -This is terrible. It is? - What are we gonna wear? -What are we gonna wear?

You're supposed to be finding a bride. I've tried, Father. Really, I have. But no one will dance with me. They mostly swim away screaming when I get near. [SNIFFING] Shoo. Oh. No wonder. What is that stink? Oh, that's my Quidest fetere. It's quite rare, you know. In fact, you can only find it in the coral reefs. Well, lose it. Now get out there and dance. [GRUNTS] Does he always speak to you that way? What Way? Oh, there's the music. Excuse me, Father says I have to go dance. Well-- You know, I like to dance. Really? You wouldn't mind? And I thought your flower was beautiful. I know. Wasn't it awesome? And Their Majesties will be drinking the merberry nectar reserve tonight. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] And the clam said, "I couldn't play because I pulled a muscle." [ALL LAUGHING] [LUMINA & KUDA GIGGLING] Hey- [c:llc:Ill\1c3] Narwhal. LUMINA: Unh. Miss Lumina, welcome. I must thank you. You did absolute wonders with Fergie. I almost didn't recognise him. - Then, sadly, I did. -Uh-- You're welcome. Excuse me, General Caligo. I call the first dance. Of course, Prince Dolphin. [DOLPHIN SQUEAKS] -It's Delphin. -Whatever. Prince Delphin? And you deliver hair supplies too? It's more of a hobby than anything else... ...when not performing my more princely duties. You're joking, right? [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] DELPHIN: And what about you? Hairstylist by day, princess by night? Princess? Who me? I'm the furthest thing from a princess. Now who's joking? [DELPHIN CHUCKLES] Dolphin, right? I'm Kuda. Heh. [DOLPHIN SQUEAKING] You don't say much, do you? [COUGHING] Huh. [DOLPHIN LAUGHS] Finally. Had that sardine stuck in my throat for weeks. I'm sorry. Now what were you saying? - Whoo! -Aah! Would you not? [MURRAY LAUGHING] Sorry. - Everything going as planned? -Like clockwork. Their Majesties will grace us with their presence... ...15 minutes from now... ...for what will be the king's final appearance. What about the girl? We're zeroing in. Every crawly creature in town... ...is now looking for a 17-year-old blond girl named Lumina. Don't worry, we'll get her. [GRUNTS] Named what? [MURRAY GRUNTS] Lumina. It was on her note. Is that her? Why, yes, so it would seem. Dancing in the castle. I never would have believed it. You dance as if you've done it a hundred times. [CHUCKLES] - Thank you. -I'll get us some refreshments. Promise me the next dance? [LUMINA CHUCKLES] I promise. Oh, General Caligo. I already promised Prince Delphin the next dance. But I can dance with you after that. Huh? Tell me, Miss Lumina, are you here with your parents? My parents? Actually, I was raised by my aunt. Hmm. I see. One of life's little secrets. LUMINA: Aah! -Some secrets are best kept under wraps. [LUMINA WHIMPERS THEN SCREAMS] Hey! What do you guys think you're--? No witnesses. [CALIGO GRUNTS AND KUDA SCREAMS] Yikes! [CALIGO YELLS AND KUDA SCREAMS] Unh. Oh. [CHUCKLES] [SQUEAKS] [CHUCKLES] Where do you want them? The castle dungeon. This time, I'm going to make sure the job is done right. [BOTH GASP] [GIRL 1 GIGGLES] GIRL 2: He's cute. Ha! [SPIKE GASPS] [CALIGO GRUNTS] Ah. Get out of my way, you oversized pincushion. Well, excuse me. I wouldn't want you to be poisoned. Yeesh. Poison? What do you know about the poison? You were almost skewered by my poisonous spikes. Oh. Holy mackerel, somebody woke up on the wrong side of the seabed. Argh. [MURRAY SNICKERING] Argh. Haven't eels ever heard of mouthwash? [MURRAY GRUNTS AND KUDA SQUEAKS] What do you want with us? [MURRAY SNICKERING] Patience. Patience, my dear. You'll find out soon enough. [MURRAY SNICKERING] Wait. I remember you, from the reef. Aren't you a friend of my aunt? MURRAY: Oh, I'd hardly say a "friend." Your aunt and I are more business associates. [MURRAY SNICKERS] Uh, what kind of business? - We're exterminators of a sort. -Aah! Yeah. And in five minutes, your aunt's gonna exterminate the king. Right. She's gonna poisonate him. [GARTH & WORMWOOD GUFFAWING] WORMWOOD: Hey. Ow! LUMINA: That's crazy. Aunt Scylla would never poison anyone. Uh-huh. [MUSIC PLAYING AND GUESTS CHATTERING] I see you got stuck dancing with Fergie. Sorry. I don't know. I think he's kind of sweet. Oh, really? Where's Lumina? She's probably fawning over the tablecloths or sconces or something. Lumina, what are we gonna do? Hmm. [GASPS] Ha, bribery. Good thinking. Not exactly. GARTH: May I have another card, please? MURRAY: Go. WORMWOOD: "May I have another card?" Thank you for asking politely. GARTH: Nope, it's my turn right now. -Huh? [LUMINA WHISTLING] MURRAY: Hmm. Everything ready, captain? Just awaiting your word, sir. Excellent. Did you see, Father? Did you see? I was dancing with a real girl. Good. I'm thrilled it wasn't a plant. WORMWOOD: Heh-heh-heh. Hit me. - Hit me. -I don't want to hit you. I want to play cards. GARTH: Please just ante up. - Aah. -Huh? Nah. Phew. WORMWOOD: Hit me. MURRAY: I'm gonna hit him... ...if he says hit me one more time. WORMWOOD: Hit me. GARTH: No, no one's hitting each other. - Give me three. -Okay, three. Oh. Now what? How do we distract the Noodle Brothers? Hey! What did you do that for? Do what? I didn't do nothing. Ow! Have you lost your mind? - No, I swear. He must've done it. -Did not. - You started it. MURRAY: Cut that out. WORMWOOD: You hit me first. GARTH: Did not. WORMWOOD: Did too. GARTH: Yes, you did. WORMWOOD: Hey. GARTH: What? [ALL GRUNTING] [MURRAY & WORMWOOD CONTINUE GRUNTING] Shall we? Let's. MURRAY: Grab them! That way, you idiots. All together. One, two, three. One, two, three. [MURRAY GRUNTS] Uh, is it too late to make a deal? Your nectar for the toast, sir. [SNIFFING] Mm-hm. [LAUGHS] [SCOFFS] [SNIFFS] You don't believe what those slimeball eels said about Soylla, do you? I don't know what to believe. But if Aunt Scylla's in some kind of trouble, we've got to help her. Whoa! Halt! [BOTH PANTING] Full speed ahead. [QUEEN LORELEI SOBBING] KING NEREUS: I know, Lorelei, I know. We wanted so much for the Pearl of the Sea and the kingdom... ...to someday go to our little girl. Try to be brave. Come, come, woman. You can't hold on to things forever. That belongs to the king and queen. What? What did you say? The nectar. You should be serving it. Oh, yes, you're right. You're very right. Give me that, Caligo. I'm done poisoning people. Aha. So I was right. No, thanks. I'll just hang on to this one, if you don't mind. Caligo, I'm trying to save your-- Oh, I know what you're trying to do. You think I'm a fool? Fine. It's your funeral. She thinks she can outsmart me. Unless that's just what she wants me to think. [GUARDS TRUMPETING] Loyal citizens of Seagundia... ...we gather today to present our kingdom's most treasured symbol... ...the Pearl of the Sea... ...to a fine young lad who will one day inherit our throne. Ugh. Oh, right. [LUMINA PANTING] Quick. This way. [BOTH slc3l-l] Oh, no. LUMINA: Aah! [TRUMPETING AND GUESTS CLAPPING] Caligo, is this my cup? [CALIGO GRUNTS] [CALIGO SIGHS] KING NEREUS: And now a toast. Come, Caligo, will you not toast your own son? Oh, uh, yes. Of course. Citizens, honoured guests. To the future ruler of Seagundia... ...who will someday guide our kingdom's destiny. To my nephew, our dear brother-in-law Caligo's pride and joy... ...his only son and heir and our next monarch. To Fergie. ALL: To Fergie! Oh, forgive me. I'm so sorry. Please, Your Majesty, take mine. - Aah. -Of course. Think nothing of it. Aah! No! [BOTH PANTING] [LU MINA GAS PS] Oh, no. Aunt Scylla. The eels were right. Again, let us toast to Fergie. [PANTING] Lumina? [ALL GASPING] - What are you doing? -What's happening? She tried to attack the king. Guards, arrest her. SPIKE: You can't take her. CORA: Yeah, she's never even hurt a krill. You take your hands off of her. Let her go. She saved the king. There was poison in his cup. [ALL GASPING] Poison? How do you know that? Because I'm the one who put it there. [ALL GASPING] No. Don't listen to her. Why on earth would you want to poison me? I didn't want to. I was forced to. Forced to by-- SCYLLA: Aah! - Oh, no. -Aunt Scylla! GUEST 1: Oh, no. GUEST 2: Will she be all right? MADAME RUCKUS: What happened to her? She fell on a stonefish spike. Poor woman. That stonefish venom will finish her for sure. What have I done? You all heard the old crone. She tried to poison our beloved king. And if this girl knew, she must be an accomplice. Take her away. Please, sir, just give us a moment. Back off! MADAME RUCKUS: Mm-mm. The lady said to give her a moment. Don't make me ink you. Uh, sure. Uh, no problem. Aunt Scylla, please stay with me. Please be all right. Lumina, I need to tell you. Shh. Save your strength. Long ago, I took you from your parents. I did it to protect you. But all these years, they were suffering. I should have told them... ...but I was afraid of losing you. Please forgive me. Spike, your venom, there must be an antidote. Something that can cure her. I'm sorry. There's only one thing I know of: the sulphur lily. [FERGIS GASPS] SPIKE: But it's extremely rare. I've never even see one. Fergie, do you know that plant? [CALIGO GRUNTS] No, I don't. You heard the boy. He said it's hopeless. No, Father, it isn't. The sulphur lily is the common name for the Quidest fetere. And there's one right here. Thank you, Fergie. All you need are two petals. [GRUNTING] No! Guards, grab her. [GASPS] Lumina, get out of here. [ALL GASPING] [ALL GASPING] Aunt Scylla, stay with me. Please stay. Aah. Lumina? Aah. Aunt Scylla. [ALL CHEERING] SPIKE: Phew. KUDA: Whoo! Ha, ha! Your Majesty, what we've just seen proves how dangerous these two are. As commanding general, I insist on placing them both under arrest. It was him. Caligo. He's the one who ordered me to poison Your Majesty. He wanted the throne for his son now. The old hag is delusional. I believe her, Your Majesty. CALIGO: You fool. You could have been king. I keep telling you, Father, I don't want to be king. I want to be a botanist. - Why, you-- CORA: Oh, Fergie. [CORA & SANDRINE LAUGHING] [CALIGO GRUNTING] The pearls, have you always been able to do that? Sure. I guess. Why? Because you have the royal gift, the pearl magic. Is it possible? Could you be our daughter? She is. I am? - Aah. -But-- But how? Caligo, again. Years ago, he paid me to do away with your daughter. But I couldn't do it. So I raised her instead, away from him. In that case, I think this is Lumina's. [ALL GASPING] [ALL GASPING] Your Majesties, I am so, so sorry... ...keeping her from you all these years. I thought I did it to protect her. But the truth was I just couldn't give her up. The important thing is she's here now. Lumina, welcome home. Home? You mean, the castle? Here? But it won't be home if Aunt Scylla and Kuda aren't here with me. No, it wouldn't be right. Of course it would. You're her family too. But this is still a royal ball, is it not? And now it's a homecoming as well. [ALL CHEERING] Ha, ha. Music, maestro, please. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] In that case, I believe you owe me a dance, princess. As promised. [GRUNTING] [WHIMPERS] [GRUNTING] - Excuse me a moment, Dolphin. -Of course. I'll be right-- [COUGHING] [SQUEAKING] [KU DA CLEARS THROAT] [NARWHAL SQUEAKS] [DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [SQUEAKING] [RACHEL BEARER'S "LIGHT UP THE WORLD" PLAYING] When I was younger yesterday Things were simple Things were safe I never dreamed that I could see A better life for you and me Everyone told me to stay I held my breath, I made the leap Opened a door I'd never seen I took a chance, I made it through Now everything is coming true And this is what it's like to be Out of my shell, just like a pearl Luminous, rare Light up the world Riding the swell Still the same girl Making things better, better, better Light up the world Changing colours, making waves Something new in every day Wide awake, I live the dream Beneath the stars under the sea And now the current carries me Out of my shell, just like a pearl Luminous, rare Light up the world Riding the swell Still the same girl Making things better, better, better Light up the world You know, make it your home Come home Light up the world And feel the glow When I was younger yesterday - Out of my shell, just like a pearl SINGER: Out of my shell, just like a pearl RACHEL: Luminous, rare SINGER: Luminous, rare RACHEL: Light up the world SINGER: Light up the world RACHEL: Riding the swell SINGER: Riding the swell RACHEL: Still the same girl SINGER: Still the same girl RACHEL: Making things better, better, better Light up the world Inside your heart Make this world your home Inside your heart Oh, yeah - Make this world your home SINGER: Out of my shell RACHEL: Just like a pearl Luminous, rare Light up the world Riding the swell Still the same girl Making things better, better, better Light up the world Light up the world Light up the world Light up the world Light up the world
