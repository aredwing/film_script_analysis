 

                        When I look at Chicago today, it's hard for me to realize... that it's the same city I knew when I was a boy. All those skyscrapers... that steel and concrete... those busy streets... and the crowds. We didn't ha ve them. In my day, life was more leisurely. The women didn't wear anything on their faces then. The men made up for it. You weren't a substantial citizen unless you wore a mustache. I remember I grew one myself. But somehow, I guess I wasn't substantial enough. I was living in a boarding house then... along with other young hopefuls. Sunday was my big day. It was my one chance for an outing. Sometimes I'd pick up my friend Hickey. His uncle, Mr. Oberkugen, was my boss. We'd ride out to one of the parks to meet him. Mr. Oberkugen was an unpredictable man on weekdays... but on Sunday he was always happy. Nellie was his cashier, his accountant, and his secretary. Had been for 20 years. They never married. I used to wonder why. Like all people in love, they were worried because I had no lady friend. They'd try to get me one, but I had other plans. You hold her hand, and she holds yours and that's a very good sign That she's your tootsie-wootsie in the good old summertime In the good old summertime in the good old summertime Strolling through the shady lanes with your baby mine You hold her hand, and she holds yours and that's a very good sign That she's your tootsie-wootsie in the good old summertime That Monday morning alarm meant back to work. Some people hated that alarm... but not me. I had something to get up for. You see, the post office would be open. And that meant there might be a letter for me... one of those very special letters. - I beg your pardon, madam. - Well, I never. - Watch where you're going. - I'll fiX your hat for you. - No, that's not quite the right angle. - Leave my hat alone. Here's your umbrella. I don't really know what happened. Here's your bag. - I beg your pardon. - For heaven's sakes. - Leave me alone. - I'm terribly sorry. - Here's your hat. - Thank you. - Something's missing. - Where's my bird? Here's your bird. Here we are. I'm so sorry. - What! - Wrong bird. - For heaven's sake. Thank you. - I'll attach this. I'm terribly sorry about this. - I was in such a hurry. - Watch where you're going. - I was reading a letter. - Give me that, you're crushing my hat. I'm terribly sorry about this. - Here's your umbrella. - Thank you. - Wait a minute. - Where are you? There you are. Here's your hat, your bird... Is this yours? - Here's your bag. - Wait a minute! The umbrella. Parasol, I mean. I'm terribly sorry. - Please, madam, excuse me. - "Please, madam"? Here's your bird, and here's your bag. Now I've really got to go. - Go. - I've got to go to the office. Look, here's my card. That's where I work, see? You go buy yourself whatever I've ruined... and I'll be glad to pay for it. All right? - Thank you very much. - Goodbye. Wait a minute. I was head salesman at Mr. Oberkugen's, getting a good salary: $15 a week. - Good morning, Andy. - Good morning, Nellie. - Good morning. - Good morning, Hickey. - Morning. - Morning, Rudy. You're late. Mr. Oberkugen had to let us in. I know. See, I... Come here a minute. Sit down. I got another letter. - From the girl that advertised? - Yeah. You wanna hear something nice? "Dear Friend... "my heart was trembling as I walked into the post office... "but there you were, Iying in BoX 237. "I took you out of your envelope and read you... "read you right there, dear Friend. " But I thought she wanted to correspond with you on intellectual subjects. Isn't that intellectual? Positively poetry. Wait, there's more. "Are you short or tall? "Are your eyes blue or brown? "Don't tell me. What does it matter if our minds meet?" You're right. It is intellectual. "There are so many wonderful things to write about in this world of ours. "It would be wasting precious time if we told each other... "the sordid details of our daily lives, so don't let's do it. "I agree with you when you say: "Tis happier to be dead... "'to die for beauty than to live for bread. "' Did you say that? Ralph Waldo Emerson said it first. Yes? Mr. Oberkugen wants to see you. Thanks. How is he this morning? - Peaches and cream. - I hope so. How many times must I tell you? That violin is priceless! I'm sorry, Uncle Otto. Don't call me Uncle Otto. In the store, I am Mr. Oberkugen. Yes, sir. AII I did was pluck his violin. That Dummkopf... the Stradivarius, he picks it like a mandolin. It's your fault. If you'd been here on time, it wouldn't have happened. - Sorry, sir. I had a little accident. - It's no excuse. Everybody can have an accident. Did you hurt yourself? - No, I didn't. - Good. I hate the dangerous bicycle. Come. I have something to show you. I am sure you will like it. It's a surprise for the whole business. Look. I have a chance to buy 100 of these from Kramer. We can make a nice little profit, no? - What do you think of it? I think it's great. - I'm afraid it's not for us. - You've hardly looked at it. - I don't have to. It's a harp. Not enough people play harps. It's wonderful how quickly you can decide. I have been in this business 20 years. It took me an hour to decide I liked it... but you, Professor... Hickey! Yes, Uncle... Mr. Oberkugen? Miss Burke, please. No. Mr. Hansen! - Yes, sir? - Look at this, please. What do you think of it? Mr. Larkin doesn't happen to like it. I do. But don't let me influence you. I just want your honest opinion. That's all I want, your honest opinion. I think it's just wonderful. - Have you changed your mind? - No, I still say they're not for us. I agree with Andy. Thank you. That's all. Now we're in for it. This was his way of soothing himself when things went wrong. But he was the only one who was soothed. Hickey knew the way to hold his job. Good morning, madam. May I help you? Hello, Miss... - Fisher. - Miss Fisher, yeah. Looks like I ran up quite a bill, doesn't it? - How much do I owe you? - I couldn't accept anything from you. - Really, you must. - No, I couldn't. Really. That's definite. - My goodness. - This is a nice store you have. - Thank you. We like it. - It's got lovely things. Maybe you'd let me buy you something. Is there anything here you'd like? - As a matter of fact, there is. - Fine. No. A harmonica? No? How about a little piano? - Music box? - No, I want a job. Sorry, I sold the last one yesterday. See here, this is no joking matter. That's why I was so furious when you bumped into me. I was all dressed up ready to go out and look for a job when... I'm sorry. We couldn't take anyone else on now. It's the dull season. You haven't even heard my qualifications. I worked at Roberts Brothers, and I worked at Gregory Music Store. They liked me very much there. They all said they'd be very happy to have me back. Why don't you make them happy? Because it's the dull season. I'm sorry. I couldn't take anyone else on. Good day. Just a minute. - Do you own this store? - No, but I... Then I'd like to see the owner. I wouldn't advise it. He's in a very bad mood. - I insist upon seeing the owner. - I've been here for a number of years now. I know him inside and out. I know what his attitude would be. I can tell you word for word eXactly what he'd say. I'll be... - Mr. Larkin, just a moment, please. - Excuse me, please. - Excuse me, madam. - Surely. Come here. So you know all about me. You know eXactly what I think even before I think of it. You are not only a business genius, you are a mind reader. - I wouldn't... - Never mind. Good morning. - I'm Mr. Oberkugen. - How do you do? - How do you do? Please have a seat. - Thank you. I don't know what the difficulty is... but at Oberkugen's, there's no such word as impossible. What is it that you desire? You see, I was at Gregory Brothers... I assure you, we have much better merchandise. We have violins, we have flutes... we have... Wonderful. Something new. Look. Some of our sales force do not agree with me... but I think it's charming. I guarantee you didn't find anything as lovely as this at Gregory's. I don't think you understand. I worked at Gregory Brothers. I'm looking for a job. But wait a minute. I play the piano and the violin. Wait. You can play what you want, I have no time. Good morning. Why do you put me in a situation like that? - I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. - Whose fault was it? Mine? - Yes, I think it was. - What's the matter with you? You feel to me like a son, but every time you contradict me. Whatever I say, you say no. Why? All right. From now on, I'll say: "Yes, Mr. Oberkugen. Certainly, Mr. Oberkugen. " I'll take care of this. There's no use your waiting around. As soon as there's an opening, you'll be called first. - Tell me, do you like it? - Yes. You see. Is it so hard to play? No, anyone can learn. And it's so romantic. What's romantic about it? The soft, rippling music... - and the way your hands... - That's the woman's point of view. - How much are you asking for it? - I thought $75. Yes, that's a bargain. - A real bargain. - It's a pretty harp, isn't it? - Yes, it's a very unusual one. - I was really looking for a song. May I help you? Here's a very popular song of the day. I knew you sang. I could tell by your voice. Of course, for anyone who sings, the harp is so flattering. Your hands... I have hardly any voice, but if there's a number you'd like to hear... How about this? You might like it. Lovely Iyrics. No, this. Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland. - Could someone... - Yes, may I? - Fine. Thank you. - Come. - Go to the piano. - Isn't it pretty? Please, madam, have a seat. - Of course, if you can't play... - I can play. Sure, he can play. Sit down. Meet me tonight in dreamland under the silv'ry moon Meet me tonight in dreamland where love's sweet roses bloom Come with the love light gleaming in your dear eyes of blue Meet me in dreamland sweet, dreamy dreamland there let my dreams come true Meet me tonight in dreamland under the silv'ry moon Meet me tonight in dreamland where love's sweet roses bloom Come with the love light gleaming in your dear eyes of blue Meet me in dreamland Sweet, dreamy dreamland There let my dreams come true Lovely. - How much is it? - $99.50, reduced from $100. - I'll take it. - Fine. Could I have the sales book, please? And your pencil. - Sure you wouldn't like my job, too? - Not yet. - Aunt Addie. - In here, dear. I have a job. - Position. - Whatever it is, I have it. - Who's this? - That's Jerome. - Hello, baby. - Mrs. Spring's Jerome. She had to go down and pay her gas bill. Tell me, what kind of a position? It's in a music store, and the boss is a darling. - Any other gentlemen? - Yes, I think there are three of them. - Hand me that lace, dear. - Which, this one? There's the boss' nephew, and then there's a Mr. Hansen. Are they young men? One of them is a young man. Mr. Larkin, he's a head salesman. He's the one who didn't want to give me the position. Anyway, I went over his head and went to the boss and got the job. - I don't think he likes me at all. - I nearly forgot. I went by the post office. There was another letter in the box for you. It's there on the table. This makes my day perfect. "Dear Friend... " "Dear Friend... " - You don't eat. Why? - I've had enough, Joe. Thanks. - If you ask me, you are in love. - You think so? - I know. She don't eat, too. - Who? He asks me who. All the time like this. Then, when you come in, she... Look. I knew it, just like that. Just a minute. - Hello. - Hello. That was fine. - Did you recognize it? - Sure. That was the music you sent me last night. I thought it might do for your audition. Haven't you sent your application in yet? - No, I'm afraid I haven't. - Don't let me down. I was telling my lady friend about you only today. Your lady friend? Yes. I was telling her how you're going to win the scholarship and go to Leipzig... and how you'll be famous and that one day I'd boast... that I used to live in the same boarding house with you. I never heard you speak about your lady friend before. Really? That's funny. That's been going on for quite a while. I thought I'd told you. After all, why should you? We never spoke about much but music, did we? No, that's true. I have to go. About that scholarship, you'd better get busy on it. I haven't a chance to win. Of course you have, if you put your mind to it. I'll bring you music every night, and even a decent violin to play. How's that? I've got a stake in your career, you know. All right, I'll send in the application tomorrow. - Good girl. - Thanks. I often wondered if the girl I was corresponding with... was as wonderful as her letters. September and October passed, and I was still writing letters... and still trying to sell those harps. Do you think Eric would like that gramophone? I don't know, but it's very pretty. Pardon me, I can't see very well without my glasses. Can you tell me how much that charming little harp is? $99.50. You certainly get wonderful values here. I wonder how Oberkugen can do it. If you don't know, Mr. Oberkugen, who does? - Good morning. - Morning. They look fine, the harps. I wish the customers thought so. - Good morning, Uncle... Mr. Oberkugen. - Morning. Good morning. We're having a wonderful morning. - Yeah? - Yes, I just sold my third gramophone. Good morning, Otto. I've been looking over the bills. We ought to attend to some of these... They shouldn't have left that there. I love it. Of all the instruments, the harp is perhaps the most beautiful. Look at it, the classic lines, the mysterious tones... it seems to come from the air. It's wonderful. You don't have to keep them. Kramer will take them back. We're good customers. We've given them a lot of business this year. - All you have to do is to eXplain... - Wait a minute. What should I eXplain? But you can see for yourself, we've had them for two months. Nobody will buy them. - I'll call up Kramer. - You shouldn't call. They will sell, I know. Please give them time. This is my business. Very well. There's the bill for them. I've done the best I can. I never saw such a man. Stubborn! - $19.75 out of $20, please. - May I have your sales check? Certainly. Let's see. That's $241 worth of business I've done already this morning. - Splendid. - So you see, you were wrong. This shop could stand another salesperson. 10 cents, 20 cents, 25 cents. I think you're angry because I sold a harp and you couldn't. On the contrary, I'm delighted. - I only wish you could sell the other 99. - Who knows? I may. Thank you very much. Please come and see us again soon. It's always nice to see you. I'll open the door for you. - Just a moment, please. - Yes, sir. Could you tell me how this goes? - I'd be very glad to play it for you here. - Thank you. This is a very popular song of the day. I think you might like it. Put your arms around me, honey hold me tight Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might Oh, babe, won't you Excuse me. Would you like a little help? - All right. - Fine. From the beginning? I'll sing the verse. Introduction, please. Key of B flat. Here we go. Nighttime am a-fallin ', everything is still and the moon am a-shinin ' from above Cupid am a-callin ', every Jack and Jill It's just about the time for makin ' love Someone is a-waitin ' all alone for me No more hesitatin ' I must go and see How d'ye do, dear? It's with you, dear that I long to be Put your arms around me, honey Hold me tight Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might Oh, babe won't you roll them eyes? Eyes that I just idolize When they look at me my heart begins to float Then it starts a-rockin ' like a motorboat I never knew any boy like you all your might Oh, baby won't you roll them eyes? Eyes that I just idolize your eyes And when they look at me my heart begins to float Then it starts a-rockin ' like a motorboat I never knew any boy like you Fifteen cents, please. Dear Friend... Dear Friend... If only once you'd admit you'd made a mistake. In all the years I've known you, I've yet to hear you say, "I was wrong. " All right. You will hear me say it now. I was wrong. For 20 years I have been wrong... thinking I could marry a woman who spies on me. - A woman who spies on you? - Yes, spies on me. It looks as if we're going to have a white Christmas. Does it? I thought it did. I don't know... why he gives me a different answer every time I ask him a simple question. - Morning. - Morning. - I'm glad someone is happy. - This is gonna be a big day in my life. Say, do you mind if I ask you a personal question? No, go ahead. Suppose a fellow like me wants to get married. - Congratulations. - No, I said "suppose. " For instance, suppose I wanna get a three-room flat... one of those things with a bedroom and a dining room... - and a living... - Dining room? - What do you want a dining room for? - Where will we eat? In the kitchen. You get yourself a big kitchen. - Where will we entertain? - What are you, an ambassador? Listen, if a friend is really a friend, he comes after dinner. Yeah, but suppose after we get married... - I haven't even asked her yet. - Who? That young lady you were corresponding with on intellectual subjects. That's the one. Anyway, after a while, we got around to the subject of love... - on a very intellectual plane, of course. - How else can you in a letter? So tonight we'll meet for the first time at Heinkel's Restaurant. - Isn't that wonderful? - How will you know her? She's gonna carry a carnation and a book of poetry. - Very appropriate. And you? - I'm gonna wear one in my buttonhole. She's the most wonderful girl. She's got such high ideals... - such delicacy of feeling. - Good morning. I'll tell you more later. Here comes the duchess. - Someone else is happy today. - Good morning, Mr. Hansen. Morning, Miss Fisher. - I know, I'm late. - No. That shirtwaist you wore yesterday, the yellow one with the green dots? No, as usual you're wrong again. It was a green one with yellow dots. Everyone else seemed to think it was very becoming. As I recall, I've never mentioned anything about those neckties you wear. And believe me, if you think I couldn't, you're crazy. - My neckties are... - So leave my shirtwaist alone. - It's none of your business. - Mr. Oberkugen seems to think it is. - That's right. I'm working under you. - Let's not forget it. From now on, I'll phone you every morning... and tell you eXactly what I'll wear. Is that all right? If you want to dress up like a circus pony, go ahead. But I don't want the boss taking it out on me. Listen here... I sold just as much as anybody else in that shirtwaist yesterday. - Really? - Did you tell Mr. Oberkugen that? - I did. - And what did he say? - He said, "Tell her not to wear it. " - Tell him I won't. - I will. - Thank you. Don't mention it. I didn't know it was over. You know that green blouse that I had on yesterday? - The one with the little yellow dots? - Yes. - I think it's lovely. - Did you like it? I'm so glad. Because I have an important engagement tonight... and I didn't know whether to wear that or something a little more formal. - I always think... - Morning, everybody. Morning. - Good morning, Miss Fisher. - Good morning. May I tell you, you look charming today? What do you say we dress up tonight, have an early dinner, and go to the opera? - I'm sorry, I can't. - What is it? You don't feel well? I feel very well, thank you. I have another engagement. You can get out of it. EXplain it to her and she will understand. What makes you so sure it's a woman? I have men friends, too, you know. You are not going out with another man? - Yes, I am. - You couldn't do such a thing. And who's going to stop me? Yes, sir? Will you please tell everybody to stay after work tonight? We are taking inventory. - Tonight? - Yes, tonight! There are a lot of things on our shelves that are not moving. I should like to know what they are. I want a thorough check made of all our merchandise. Is it absolutely necessary that I stay here tonight? Because I've got such an important engagement... - and could you possibly spare me? - That's entirely up to Mr. Larkin. Could you get along without Miss Fisher? As a matter of fact, I was about to ask you if I could have tonight off, too. What is it? Does everybody want to leave? - Once a year, I ask you to stay here. - If it wasn't such an important... I see, you want a special invitation. Next time I'll send you an engraved announcement. - I think we can manage without Andrew. - Did I ask you for advice? - No. - Uncle Otto, I can take... Tonight is inventory. Everybody stays. That's final. - Number K52T, four. - I thought you said three. Those are banjo cases. Metronomes, six. - Got it? - Got it. Small harps, 99. - Got it? - You just love to rub that in, don't you? - I am merely taking inventory. - No matter what I do, it's wrong. If I wrap a package, it's wrong. You want everything done your way and even then you don't like it. When I came here, I was a very enthusiastic girl. Now look at me. One of these days, I might find out that I don't have to work at all... and then I'll really tell you what I think of you. I have to get another blank. Mr. Larkin, I don't like you. Could I have a new blank, please? - Don't feel so badly, dear. - I can't help it. We'll never finish here tonight... and I'm going to miss the most important engagement ever. Maybe we'll finish in time. Is that clock right? - Yes, dear, it is. - I'm never gonna make it. Couldn't you telephone the young gentleman? I can't. I don't even know his number. Yes. Thanks. I have an engagement. I'd like to get out of here. So would I. - Yes? - Would you hold the ladder, please? You might count that music while you're at it, too. - All right. - The ladder! All right. Sure. It's almost 8:00. Is it? - Is it too late for us to have that dinner? - What about your friend? I just made him up. No, I know. You are just being kind to me. You are a very handsome woman, a very attractive woman. Now, Otto. I should have known you couldn't care for an old fool like me. - Why, Otto... - I know. I am not worthy of you, but I always hoped... when I became a famous violinist, then, maybe... But to find out suddenly that there is someone else... Listen to me. There isn't anybody else. - No? - Really. I made him up. You made him up? I'll go and get your things. Children, what are you doing here so late? Go home, all of you. - Hurry, please. - Yes, dear. I'll be there in just a minute. Oh, dear. - Will you help me with this, please? - I really shouldn't be helping you. After all, having dinner in a public place with a strange man. He isn't a strange man. I know all about him. After all, we're practically engaged. Just the same, you have never been introduced. That's convention. A silly convention for ordinary people. This is different. It's just like he said: "You can't keep a love like ours in an envelope. " And you know, I know just what he'll look like. He'll be tall, and dark, and terribly handsome... and sort of sad. - Don't look so sad. - To tell you the truth, I don't feel so good. Look out for the carnation. It's 8:15. You don't have time to feel bad. - Where's the buttonhook? - On that desk. I don't think I should go. For her sake, I mean. I've told this girl what an important man I am. When she sees me, it's gonna be an awful shock. Don't you worry, it's going to be love at first sight. On the other hand, what about me? Suppose I don't like her? You don't know how lucky you are. Most men fall for a pretty face. Then they find out there's nothing behind it. - But you know what's behind it. - But what's in front of it? - She'll be beautiful, you'll see. - I wish I'd never learned to read or write. - Good luck. - Wait a minute. You look, I'm afraid to. - No. - Go on. All right. - You see anything? - Not yet. - There's a beautiful girl. - Yeah? Very beautiful, but no book. I think I see her right there. A book and a carnation. I can't see her face. She's sitting behind the clothes rack. She's leaning forward now. - Can you see her? - Yes. - Is she pretty? - Very pretty. Really? I would say she has something of the coloring of Miss Fisher. Miss Fisher? At the store? You must admit that Miss Fisher's a very good-looking girl. Personally, I've always rather liked her. This is no time to be talking about Miss Fisher. I can tell you right now, if you don't like Miss Fisher... you won't like this girl. - Why? What do you mean? - Because it is Miss Fisher. What? Of all the people in the world, that one. The nerve of her! Please, you can't just walk off and leave her sitting there. What do you mean, I can't? If she was the last woman on earth and we were on a desert island... I'd still walk off and leave her there. Wait a minute. Remember, she wrote you all those letters? I don't believe it. She couldn't and even if she did... Good night. I'll be right back. - I thought you weren't coming in tonight. - I was on my way... But I'm so glad you did. I have such wonderful news for you. They accepted my application, and I'm auditioning on Friday night. - That's wonderful, Louise. - You'll come, won't you? - Sure. I'll be there. - You've got to come. - What? - You're not ill, are you? - No. - It's just that you look a little strange. - No, I feel fine. - All right, then. - Keep your fingers crossed. Bye. - Bye. - Excuse me, miss, could I have this chair? - No, please. I'm waiting for someone. He'll be here any minute. He must be special for you to wait this long. He is very special. Just leave it here. - Thank you. - Thank you. What a coincidence. I had an appointment here, too. - Did you see Rudy Hansen? - No, I haven't. - Do you mind if I sit and wait for him? - No, please don't. - I have an appointment myself. - Yes, I remember. - Your friend seems to be a little late. - He'll be here. I see you're reading Elizabeth Browning. Yes. Any objections? No. It just seems to me quite a surprise. - Wait... - I didn't know you liked classical poetry. - There are a great many things... - People are watching. There are a great many things that you don't know about me. - Really? - Yes. Tell me, have you ever read Emerson's essays? - No, I haven't. - I have. And there are a great many things you don't know about me. It's such a pity that people so seldom... go to the trouble of scratching the surface to find out the inner truth. I wouldn't care to scratch your surface... because I know that underneath I'd find, instead of a heart, a piccolo. Instead of a soul, I'd find a flute, and instead of an intellect... I'd find a metronome that doesn't work very well. - That's very well put. - Thank you. - A metronome? - Yes. It's such an interesting miXture of poetry and meanness. - Very well put. - Meanness? Don't misunderstand me. I think you understood me when I said I was waiting for someone. If your party doesn't show up... Don't worry about my party showing up. He'll show up. In the meantime, you needn't bother to stay here and entertain me. As you wish. - Have you read Crime and Punishment? - Are you still here? Are you deliberately trying to ruin my evening? No. Do you hear what they're playing? You know what that song reminds me of? Yes, 99 harps. Wrong again. It reminds me of a girl who was looking for a job. - A very nice girl, I thought. - How you can lie. That was before you began to make fun of me... giving imitations of me in the locker room. And I'd like to tell you now that I am not bowlegged. - You're not? - No. - I have information to the contrary. - It's a lie. If you think I'm bowlegged, come out to the sidewalk and I'll prove it. - I'll pull up my trousers. - What? And another thing, you may have beautiful thoughts... but you certainly hide them. You're cold and snippy like an old maid. If you don't watch out, that's what you'll be. - I? An old maid? - Yes. As you go on, you get funnier and funnier. I've got some letters I could show you, written by a man so far superior... that it's ridiculous. They'd really open your eyes. - I, an old maid? - Yes. - You belittling counter-jumper! - Counter-jumper? Well! Thank you and good night, Elizabeth Browning. Tell me, what was he like? - I never saw him. - What? That Mr. Larkin came in and sat at my table. He wouldn't leave. He just talked until it was so late that... When I left I found this Iying outside in the snow. He must have seen us through the window. He must have seen us together and thought... You can write to him. You can eXplain. I can never explain this. He'd never understand. Good night. He'll never understand. Hello. Miss Fisher's aunt just telephoned to say she's ill. - She won't be in today. - I think we'll live through it. I don't understand you. How can you be so mean to her? Last night, she was waiting for you, and you wouldn't go in to see her. You walked away and left her sitting there alone. - That's enough to upset any girl. - Don't talk to me about her. You don't know her like I do. The least you could do is to telephone her. If there's any telephoning to be done, she can call me. I don't understand. It's so silly. Too ill to come in. - Is that you, Aunt Addie? - Yes, dear. - Was there a letter for me? - After all, he hasn't had time. I'll never hear from him again. Now, Veronica, maybe he was called out of town on business... or maybe his mother was sick. I wish I were dead. There's another mail in an hour. I'll try again. - Maybe that's the young man now. - No, it couldn't be. He doesn't know my number, he doesn't even know my name. Hello. Who is it? Just a moment, please. It's Mr. Larkin from the store. Will you speak to him? No. I don't wanna talk to him. Tell him anything. I'm sorry. She isn't feeling very well. I hope it's nothing serious. That's good. Tell her we miss her. What I mean is, she's a good worker. She's a very good worker... and what with Christmas coming on, we can't afford to lose a good worker. Tell her I might drop by on my lunch hour, just to see how she is. All right. - Good morning. - It's you. - Might I come in? - All right. I'm sorry to come to the door like this, but my aunt isn't home. I hope you'll forgive the intrusion. This is really a business call. - Won't you come in? - I felt that being in charge, I ought to... - Check up on me? - No, I didn't say that. I just wanted to... How are you? I'll get over it someday, I suppose. Have you seen a doctor? No. I don't need a doctor, you see. My trouble is what you might call psychological. - If it's only psychological... - Only psychological! What I mean is... Mr. Oberkugen is giving a party tomorrow night at the Vienna Gardens... and if you came to that, it might help you. Psychologically, I mean. - A party? - Yes. - At a beer garden? - Yes. It's obvious... that you just have no understanding of women. It's really an engagement party. Nellie and Mr. Oberkugen are gonna be married. He's taking over the hall for the entire evening. It's amazing. After 20 years, Nellie has finally decided to... No, I'll go. I'll answer the door. You stay right there. Mama had to run to catch a trolley to go to the market. She asked if Miss Addie'd mind the baby for her? I got to take my music lesson. - Just in case. Bye. - Bye. - You've got a visitor. - It's Jerome. Here, I'll take him. No, you go sit down. I know how to do it. Left hand supporting the back, and the right supporting the body. That's very good, yes, but you better give him to me anyway. Goodness gracious. - How did you learn so much about babies? - I've had dozens of them. - What? - I mean, my sister has. There's nothing you can tell me about babies that I don't already know. I'm particularly eXpert at getting that bubble up. - By the way, whose is he? - That's his mother in there. - What? - I mean, that's his mother's dummy. My aunt makes clothes for her. Easy to see where he gets his looks from. Don't let him get too warm. - I won't. I'll take this off. - Support the back. I will. I'm fine. I've taken care of him for months. - Does your sister live here? - No, Wichita. I came from Wichita. You must miss them. Those bubbles, I mean. Yes, I do. They're good kids. - One of them was named for me. - Which one? - Andrew. - I didn't mean the name, I mean the age. He's 17 months, three weeks and two... No, one day. - He was born on my birthday. - Really? When is your birthday? - Support the back. - He's all right. - June 30. - The Crab. - What? - I mean, astrologically speaking. I'm interested in birth signs. There's nothing I can do about that now. What sign were you born under? - December. The Goat. - The Goat? And the Crab? - Yes. - No wonder we battle so much. - You know what I wish? - What? Here, you take him. Now hold his back and his head, and be very careful. I know. I've done this before. - I've got it! - How wonderful. This is Mr. Larkin from the store. How do you do? This isn't a social call. - We mustn't keep you from your lunch. - I've got plenty of time, really. - Let me have Jerome. - All right. - I'll get some tea. - Good. Fine. - Go ahead, read your letter. - Do you mind? - No, not at all. - Thank you. - Good news? - Very good news. I'll be back to work tomorrow. And besides, I'll even go to the party tomorrow night. No! Isn't it amazing what one letter can do? At this moment, I feel so good I could even forgive you. Forgive me? For what? - You spoiled my date last night. - I did? Yes. This young man came along, looked through the restaurant window... saw you sitting at my table, and he misunderstood it. - He thought that you and I were... - Yes. He says here, "Tell me truthfully, who was that attractive young man? "He's just the type women fall for. " He's certainly got a sense of humor. He sounds like a strange sort of a fellow to me. Imagine being afraid to go to a table because another man was sitting there. He wasn't afraid. He was just being tactful and sensitive. You see, it's very hard... to explain a man like him to a man like you. Why? Where you would say white, he would say black. Where you would say "old maid," he'd say: "eyes that sparkle with fire and mystery. " - What else? - "Vivacious, fascinating... " There are a lot of things. If you'll forgive me, I have to answer this immediately. I wouldn't stop you for the world. I'll run along and I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Why don't you ask your friend to come to the party? - Maybe I will. - Bye. Dear Friend... Look at it flash. It looks just like a rainbow. Aren't you pleased? I should think you'd be so happy. Indeed I am. He wanted me to have it in time for the party tonight. Someday I'm going to have one just like that. Why, of course you will, dear. You deserve it. Why don't you ladies run along? You'll be late for the party. - I'll take care of the cash boX. - That's very nice of you. Thank you. - Allow me. - Thank you. May I escort you to the party tonight? - Why, yes. - Yes? - I'll call for you at 8:00. - Fine. What about your friend? - Isn't he coming along? - No. He prefers to have me all to himself. I don't blame him. Why, Mr. Larkin... If you're really in love with a girl, you don't take her to a big party. You take her somewhere where there's music... get a little table, just the two of you. - Yes? - I know just the place. You do? I'll tell your friend about it if I ever meet him. Thank you very much. Here you are. Thanks. - When are you going to break it to her? - As soon as I get a raise. - Yes, sir? - Come in before you leave. If you want a raise, now's your chance. You'll never find him in a better mood. - Wish me luck. - I do. Thank you. Sit down. I want to talk with you. Each day I have given you a little more responsibility... and each day you have proved more worthy of my trust. I've tried to do my best. But I have never really eXpressed my appreciation in any tangible way. I wouldn't say that, sir. Now I'm going to show you how much faith I have in you. Thank you, sir. I am going to let you carry my violin for me tonight. - What? - It is to be a surprise for Nellie. - But, Mr. Oberkugen... - I'm going to play it for her... but I cannot carry it myself... - or she will be, as you say... - Wised up. She shouldn't be wised up. So you will take it for me, you know? And then at the proper time, you will ask me to play... and I will say, "But I have no fiddle. " And you will say, "Why, I just happen to have one with me. " Good? No, I couldn't possibly. It's too much of a responsibility. A Stradivarius is worth thousands of dollars. I know. I can say to you, "I trust you. " - No, really. - No, not another word. Take care of it and guard it with your life. - Yes, sir. - Goodbye. - It's going to be a lovely party. - I hope so. I'll see you later. - What have you got there? - We were... No. He isn't going to play for all those people tonight? I'm afraid so. You can't let him make a fool of himself. You've got to do something. Anything. Ready? - Please. - All right. - What's the matter with her? - She's just feeling a little emotional. Of course. -8:00. Don't be late, and remember. - Yes, sir. Louise, come in. - I was afraid I'd missed you. - You look nice. - Thank you. Here's your card of admission. - Don't forget, I might have to go... Yes, I know you have to go to Mr. Oberkugen's party... but you'll try to get there for my part of the audition, won't you? - They're taking the violins last. - I'll try my best. - All right, fine. Thanks. - Bye. You did it! You got a violin for me. - I wanted to tell you... - I know you said you would. - This isn't Mr. Oberkugen's Stradivarius? - Yes, it is. - That's what I wanted to tell you. - He'd let me use it? How wonderful. How marvelous! Now I know that I can win. Yes, I'm sure you'll win. - Wish me luck, won't you? - Yeah. - Good luck. - Thanks an awful lot. All right. Bye. Wait till the sun shines, Nellie When the clouds go drifting by We will be happy, Nellie Don't you sigh Down Lovers ' Lane we'll wander Sweethearts, you and I Wait till the sun shines, Nellie By and by We will be happy, Nellie Don't you sigh Down Lovers ' Lane we'll wander Sweethearts, you and I Wait till the sun shines, Nellie By and by -9:00 and no Andrew. - Don't worry, he'll be here. May I have the honor of this dance? Why, yes. Mr. Oberkugen... may I have the honor of this dance? Excuse me. Andrew. Just a minute. Hello. It certainly looks like a wonderful party. - Wait a minute. Where's my violin? - I couldn't bring it. - What! - I just couldn't bring it. I said to myself, "Suppose I was to have an accident? "Suppose I was to fall on the ice?" Stop supposing, go home and get it. Get it this minute. It's safe and I'll bring it to you in the morning. - I'll go. - No. You stay here. I'll bring your violin. My violin. My Stradivarius. - Played yet? - No. I'm so glad you were able to make it. I've got to get back. How soon before you go on? I don't know. I have no idea. - Don't worry. I won't let it out of my sight. - Where's your violin? - I left it at home. - I'm in a little bit of trouble. - Have you got your key with you? - Yes. - Could I borrow your violin for a while? - Certainly. - It's all right, I'll eXplain later. - All right. Thanks. I'll be back. The way you look, people will think you don't want to marry me. I'm sorry. - Good night. - It was a lovely party. But you can't go yet. Something else is going to happen. - Veronica is going to entertain us. - Of course we want to stay for that. It's a surprise. She's rehearsed something with the quartet. May I have your attention, if you please. Veronica... Miss Fisher is going to entertain us. Now, Veronica. In the evening by the moonlight you should drop you folks should drop down to the old barbershop Old barbershop Down in the great big rathskeller where a swell colored fella by the name of Bill Jefferson Lord played the piano while he'd sing a song He just sang and played the whole night long Till one night a starry-eyed lady they call lovable Sadie heard him playing that barbershop chord When he finished Sadie drew a sigh Oh, Lord Every time that she would catch his eye she'd cry Mr. Jefferson Lord play the barbershop chord that soothing harmony It makes an awful, awful, awful hit with me Play that strain just to please me again 'Cause, mister when you start that minor part I feel your fingers slippin ' and a-grippin ' my heart - Oh, Lord - Oh, Mr. Lord Play the barbershop chord - Mr. Jefferson Lord - Thomas Jefferson Lord - play that barbershop chord - play the barbershop chord - That soothing harmony - Sweet harmony makes a terrible, terrible, terrible hit with me - Play that strain - Play that strain - just to please me again - just to please me again 'Cause, mister when you start that minor part I feel your fingers slippin ' and a-grippin ' my heart - Oh, Lord - Mr. Jefferson Lord Mr. Jefferson Lord play that barbershop chord - More. - More! Sing another number! They say I'm crazy, got no sense but I don't care They may or may not mean offense but I don't care You see, I'm sort ofindependent I am my own superintendent And my star is on the ascendant that's why I don't care I don't care, I don't care What they may think of me I'm happy-go-lucky They say that I'm plucky Contented and carefree I don't care, I don't care If I do get a mean and stony stare If I'm not successful It won't be distressful 'Cause I don't care A girl should know her etiquette Alas, alack Propriety demands we walk a narrow track When fellas used to blink at me I'd freeze them and they'd shrink at me But now when fellas wink at me I wink at them right back! I don't care, I don't care Ifpeople frown on me Perhaps it's the lone way But I go my own way That's my philosophy I don't care, I don't care If he's a clerk or just a millionaire There's no doubt about it I'll sing and I'll shout it 'Cause I don't care I don't care, I don't care When it comes to happiness I want my share Don't try to rearrange me There's nothing can change me 'Cause I don't care Ladies and gentlemen, you mustn't tire her. She will sing again. And now... Yes, Mr. Hickey? You have something to say? - Now? - What was it you wanted to say? Mr. Oberkugen, won't you play something for us? Why, it's very gracious of you. Very well. Unfortunately, I have no fiddle. I have a very beautiful Stradivarius, but I didn't bring it... and so I have no fiddle. That's funny. I just happen to have a Stradivarius here with me. In that case, I will play a little number which is a favorite of mine. Come on. - He's a clumsy fool. A Dummkopf! - Now, Otto, please. - How is he, Doctor? - Just a little excited. - Don't worry. He'll be all right. - Good. Come on. You've got to help me explain. He's fired, through! Don't ever let me see him again! - Don't bother, I heard him. - I'm so sorry. The Dummkopf. - My Stradivarius. - I'm sorry, Uncle Otto. I am no longer your uncle. Leave me alone. I just wanted to say... - You are fired. - Wait a minute. Andrew didn't do anything. He didn't break your violin. - He hasn't done anything. - I gave him the violin to carry. I told him to guard it with his life. Now I have no violin. - I want to tell you... - There is nothing you can tell me. - Get out of my sight. - Please listen to what he has to say. I only wanted to say that it was not your violin that broke. - Not my violin? - Isn't that wonderful? Your violin is safe. I'll have it back for you within an hour. Wait a minute. What is back? I loaned it to somebody at Symphony Hall. I'll get it now. My priceless violin, he loaned it! - Wait a minute. - I call the police. No, wait. I'm so glad that's over, aren't you? - You were wonderful. - Do you really think so? - Yes. You won it hands down. - I hope so. - Isn't that Mr. Oberkugen? - Yes. Come on. We must thank him. I just can't begin to thank you enough for your kindness. When Andy brought the violin home, I could hardly believe... I beg your pardon, Miss Parkson. The judges wish to speak to you. Yes, I'll be right there. Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart. - EXcuse me. - Yes. Sorry. She thought you sent it and I didn't have the heart to tell her. Want me to take him in? It's up to you. Not necessary. Thank you, sir. Come in the store tomorrow and get your pay. Yes, sir. I'll see you home. I won! Isn't it wonderful? - You were just fine. - Thank you. I'll get a carriage. I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me. Without you, I never would have been able to go through with it. - Of course you would. - I'm the happiest girl in the world. I cannot understand it. He fires a man like Andy and he keeps a man like you. I told you he's crazy. - Good morning. - Good morning. Can't we get in? We have to wait for Mr. Oberkugen. Andy has the only other key. Good morning. - What is it? - We have to wait for Mr. Oberkugen. I never knew before last night, Mr. Hickey, that you were an acrobat. You didn't hear. The violin that broke wasn't Mr. Oberkugen's. It wasn't? I thought it was too good to be true. - Whose was it? - It belonged... to a lady friend of Mr. Larkin's. Here's Mr. Oberkugen. Good morning, Uncle Otto. Good morning. Miss Burke... make up Mr. Larkin's pay envelope and give it to him when he comes. And get the receipt for it. And when I think how happy we all were yesterday. - Good morning. - Hello. We didn't expect you this morning. Folks, here's Andy. Good morning. I didn't think you'd be here so early this morning. I had a picture of you all standing out there freezing... and I thought I'd better bring the key over. - Thank you. - Mr. Oberkugen let us in. - Yes. - I see. - Wait a minute, I'll get you your money. - Thanks. - I feel terrible, losing you your job. - Forget it. I'm lucky. I thought he was pretty decent about it. I don't know what we'll do without you. It won't seem like the same place. Of course it will. You'd better get busy... the customers are beginning to pile up. How about Christmas dinner tomorrow? Have you got a date? Why, no. Not now. - Why not come to us? - Thanks. - Good. We'll set a place for you. - Thank you. I know that we didn't get along very well. I guess we fought a lot... but losing your job just before the holidays... - that's something I wouldn't wish on... - Your own worst enemy. I know. I didn't say that. Let's not quarrel anymore. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Good luck. - Thanks. Here you are. - A month's pay. - Thanks. - And goodbye. - This is all my fault. I'm going to tell him. You're going to do nothing of the sort. I wouldn't let you. At least I can get you a letter of recommendation. - I don't think he'd... - You knock on his door in a little while. I'll have it for you. All right. Andrew's here. I gave him his money but it'll be hard for him to get another job without a letter. Very well. To whom it may concern... I wish to state that Mr. Andrew Delby Larkin... has been with me for... - For a number of years? - For a number of years. In all this time I've found him... - Reliable? - Reliable, efficient... Wait, you said "reliable"? He isn't reliable. Taking my violin? Reliable? - No, it isn't. - It isn't honest, it isn't right. I could have had him thrown into jail for that. Yes, you could. I... Where was I? "In all this time I have found him reliable... " Efficient... eXtremely honest... and because of his diligence, I promoted him. I promoted him. I was so proud of him. Like a son he was to me. - There's Andrew for his letter. - Come in. Morning, sir. I will finish in a moment. Where was I? "Because of his diligence, I promoted him... " To the position of top salesman. Yes, and that was not all. I was going to make you manager. When Nellie and I were married... I was going to put you in charge of the store. Then you have to do this to me. I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can say now. Otto, let's forget it. Andy's leaving, and you have your violin. That's the trouble. I haven't my violin. Last night, for the first time I heard it played as it should be played. I knew then I had no right to it. I want you to give it to your young lady friend. Give it to her with my blessing. Take it tonight... after you finish work. And now that you are manager... you might give yourself a raise. You see? Sometimes I can admit I am wrong. Get going, manager. Mr. Hickey and Mr. Hansen! On your toes! As your new manager, I ask for a little more holiday spirit. - You're manager? - Congratulations. - That's more like it. - Thanks. - Where's Miss Fisher? - In the locker room. Hickey, you open up. We'll make this the biggest Christmas Eve Oberkugen has ever had. - Let's sell out the store. - Good. - What happened? - What? What are you talking about? - I thought you were discharged. - Oh, that. I was. But Mr. Oberkugen changed his mind, took me back, and made me manager. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - You know, it means a lot to me. - It does? Yes. A raise in salary, and who knows? Maybe marriage. You know, she's a very attractive girl. I think so. I was quite surprised to find that you had a girl. You mean you thought I couldn't get one, is that it? There you go, putting words into my mouth again. You're the most insufferable man I've ever met. - Now what have I done? - You were bad enough as a salesman... - but now that you're manager... - What happened? - I hurt my finger. - I'm sorry. I was happy when I came in this morning. I was happy, too. Because I wouldn't have to see you day in and day out. I can't stand it anymore. - I'm leaving! - Wait a minute. You can't leave now, just as I was about to... What? I mean, you can't walk out the day before Christmas... with the customers coming along. You needn't worry. I'll finish out the day, if that's what's bothering you. But I give you notice, Mr. Manager. I'm getting out of here tonight. This lady is interested in this song and would like to hear it. Certainly. - I'll play it for you. - Thank you. - What is it? What's wrong? - Everything. - Didn't you tell her? - No. It's all over. Forget it. Merry Christmas have a very, very merry Christmas Dream about your heart's desire Christmas Eve when you retire Santa Claus will stop and I know he'll drop Exactly what you wanted from your chimney top So be jolly ha ve a holiday as gay as holly May the ones you love be near you with the laugh of friends to cheer you When the church bells ring Like the angels sing And you hear the joyful hymn they chime Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree For a very merry Christmas time My children... this Christmas Eve has been the biggest in the history of Oberkugen's. I want to show you my appreciation. Miss Fisher, I hope this will be the first of many Christmases with us. - Thank you, but I... - Mr. Hansen, please. - You have done a fine job. - Thank you. There have been times when I have been a little cross... but you know I didn't mean it. Thanks, Uncle Otto. - Now, Andrew. - You've already made this... a very happy Christmas for me. That is for the manager. Tell your young lady she should take... good care of my... Of her Stradivarius. - Nellie, come. - Good night. Good night. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. I guess you won't need me to help you lock up. You go on home to your family, I'll close up. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. - Good night, Miss Fisher. - Good night, Mr. Hansen. - I beg your pardon. - Did you lose something? Yes. I left my stocking cap. What? I hope you don't hold it against me, my making up to Miss Fisher. I didn't know until last night that she's in love with you. I thought I was doing all right, but I guess the best man won. - Coming, Hickey? - Coming. Good night. I was wondering if you'd mind giving this to Mr. Oberkugen. Now that I'm not going to be here any longer, I couldn't think of keeping it. - You're sure you won't change your mind? - No. I was going to leave in a few weeks anyway. You're not the only one who's getting married. Really? When did this happen? - Let me help you with those. - Thank you. When did this happen? It hasn't happened yet. - I see. - Then, of course, he might not ask me. - Then again... - He might. Yes. As a matter of fact, I happen to know that it will happen. What? What do you mean you happen to know? I might as well tell you. He came to see me the other day. - Who? - Your fianc. I had a pretty uncomfortable time with him. He just didn't believe you when you wrote and told him... that I meant nothing to you. Imagine that. I just can't get this through my head. You mean that he came to see you? Yes, that's right. But you've got nothing to worry about... because I straightened the whole thing out. In a little while, you'll be Mrs. Newspickle. That's his name, isn't it? That's what he told me. Yeah, Newspickle. - He's a nice fellow. I congratulate you. - Thank you. You're a very lucky girl. Did you find that he was very attractive? Yes, I thought so. But don't try to change him. Don't you go putting him on any diet. - Would you say he was fat? - I wouldn't, no. Personally, I like that little tummy of his. It gives him a nice homey look. After all, that's what you want in a husband, isn't it? Yeah, that's what I want. And as for his being bald... I don't think anyone would know it. It's very clever the way he lets those few hairs at the back grow long... and then combs it forward over the top of his head... coming down over his ears. It's real genius. - What? - About his mind... Didn't you find that he was... very intelligent and witty... No, not witty. As a matter of fact, I found him quite depressed. But then, of course, you can't judge a man when he's out of a job. Out of a job? Why, yes. Why, he never said anything about that to me. As you say, he's very sensitive. But he thinks you can both live comfortably on what you make. Did he ask you what I make? After all, he is your fianc. He was a little worried at first... but I promised him I'd try to get you a raise. I think this is ridiculous, outrageous. I wish you could read his letters... and you'd find out that he has such a lofty point of view. Lofty? And now to find out that he's so materialistic... Materialistic, too? I'm sorry. I hate to think that I've spoiled your Christmas. You haven't spoiled it. I suppose I should be thanking you. No, you don't have to do that. But you know what I wish you would do? I wish you'd send this Newspickle about his business... and concentrate on me instead. I can't. You already have someone. - No, not yet. - Wait a minute. This is all wrong. - After all, it is Christmas. - I know, but... I love you so. Please open Box 237 and take me out of my envelope. "Dear Friend. " - You? - Yes. Are you disappointed? Psychologically, I'm very confused... but personally, I feel just wonderful.
