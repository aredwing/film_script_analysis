 

                        1 This is a sad and tragic day for all Victorians. It's a job where you send them out to it. But there's alw ays an element of danger. However. You just expect them to come home again. And on this occasion they didn't. All they were doing in the early hours of Sunday was going about their duties. Protecting the public of Victoria. The officers were searching for armed robbers as part of a special operation when they were gunned down in suburban Moorabbin just after 12:30 this morning. Mr Comrie described the murders as a shocking attack on law and order by desperate and dangerous people. Police have w arned the killer is almost certain to be desperate and dangerous. Melbourne. 1998. On a cold winter's night in the suburb of Moorabbin. Two young policemen with everything to live for were ex ecuted in cold blood. This is the story of the hunt for their killers. It's a jungle out there. I recommend centre half-forward. I mean, everybody loves you, but you're not under pressure to score a big bag of goals like the full-forward. Then again, if you want the exercise, you could always be an on-baller. Those blokes must run 10 miles a game. Basically, it comes down to size, mate. And if you're 6'3" and I've got the Richmond scout knocking on my door, I'm gonna say, "My son, Jimmy, is a key position man. " Shame if James wants to be a ballet dancer. Now, now, Mum. Don't go getting ideas in his head. Oh! You really have to work tonight? Mm-hm. Oh. Well, show me how to light the pilot light before you go. I'll do it. I should know how to do it. And what do you think I'm here for? Hmm? Oh, look at him. OK, listen up. I'm Mark Butterworth, Armed Robbery Squad. Welcome to Operation Hamada. Tonight you good and sober policemen of C District are gonna help us catch two very bad crooks who've been running wild for seven years. Open the till. Open the till. Pull it out. There were two of them, wearing masks - presidents Nixon and Reagan. Although they also do gorillas, balaclavas, pantihose, baseball caps, etc. Face down! Hands behind your back! Get down there now! Get on the fucking ground! Job one, they lifted seven grand and in the process, put the fear of God into the staff. Yeah, not if they're Buddhists, Mark. Buddhists don't believe in God. Thanks for that nugget, Sergeant Silk. During the next three years, they struck 28 times that we know of. Is this all there is? Huh? Well, you'd better raise your prices, mate. Then they went quiet for some reason, and three years later, they are back. Same MO - they strike late, tie people up with duct tape, scare 'em shitless. Ha! What have we got here? Let's see how Vietnamese tick. A month ago, they hit the Green Papaya in Surrey Hills. Very interesting. The older bloke, the talker, he gave the manager a message for us. When the cops turn up, tell them Lucifer was here. Law of averages, they're due to strike this weekend, so you lot are gonna spend your Saturday night staking out these establishments in case they do. It's a miracle Lucifer and his mate haven't killed anybody yet. We don't stop them, then they surely will. Couple of crooks in there, stuffing their ugly faces. What, our guys? Nah. I think they're waiting for a deal. Eastern European, Lebanese. Remind me to do an intel report later, eh? Hmm. Mmm, sorry in didn't mention it - how's the new bub? Brilliant. Just... Yeah. Yeah? You ought to try it. Ha! I don't think I've met the mother of my kids yet. Really? A man with your style? I mean, I thought you'd be knocking them off with a stick. Mate, I carry two sticks on me at all times. Oh, bugger. Looks like we're out of luck. What do you want to do, take an early mark or lend a hand elsewhere? You know me, Gary. I live to serve. You boys get lonely? Hey, you catch the final score, Frankie? You owe me 10 bucks. Yeah, 35 points, eh? Hey, there's another entrance from the underground car park. Anything could be going on down there. Sounds like us. Alright. Sayonara, ladies. Alrighty. Want to see his picture? Oh, look at this one. Hey, look at him. Gets his looks from his mum. Yeah. I didn't realise Carmel was bald. Gentlemen, we've got company. Moorabbin 403. You boys need a hand? Moorabbin 403, stay where you are. Come on, it's gotta be our guys. Got the rego, Gary? Negative. Can't get close enough. They must be running on rocket fuel. 404 to 403, they've given us the slip. We're heading back. It must've been our guys. Look, maybe not. Maybe our guys are back at the Silky Emperor right now. Come on, let it go, Rod. Let's go back and check it out. Is that barbecue pork I can smell? Jeez, I'm hungry, mate. Hey, Frank. Shut up. Oh, shit. He's back for a second go. Nuh, that's a different car. It's the same bloody Honda, Frank. Mate, that is a Hyundai. Moorabbin 403 to Moorabbin 404, there is a dark-coloured Hyundai coming down the ramp. Heads up, boys. Look how slow this guy's going. He's on the prowl for sure. Give them a hand? If they want our help, they'll ask for it, mate. 404 to 403, we've just turned into Cochranes Road. Looks like a single occupant. We're gonna pull him over. Twiddle our thumbs, then. Yep, single occupant. Not our night. G'day, mate. How are you? Oh, Jesus! Frank, they're shooting at 'em. Moorabbin 403. Shots fired in Moorabbin. Shots fired in Moorabbin. Repeat - shots fired in Cochranes Road, Moorabbin. Please acknowledge. Moorabbin 403. repeat. Please. Did you say shots fired? Christ! He's dead. Where's Rod? Roddy? Rod! Rod Miller! Oh, shit. His gun's still in the holster. Maybe they took him. Or... Moorabbin 403, uh, we've got one member down, one member missing. So where's Rod Miller? I want him bloody found! Moorabbin 406. We have possibly a dark-coloured small car... Oi! Over here! He's over here. Help. Can't breathe. Fucked. I'm gonna die. You're not gonna die. You're gonna be fine, mate. There was two of them. One was... one was on foot. Um, six foot. Chequered shirt. Uh-huh. Dark Hyundai. Right. Cheltenham 206. The ambuance has cleared with the second member. Roger. Cheltenham 206. The second member has been transported aw ay. The road's closed, mate. What's your business here? I'm in charge. Inspector. Sergeant. It's our fault. Hamada was an Armed Robbery operation. We drafted these men from normal duties and we put them in danger. Goes with the job. Unacceptable danger. What do we know so far? Um, Moorabbin 403 got a glimpse of the driver as they drove out of the car park. He was medium build, shoulder-length hair, three-day stubble, European, possibly Middle Eastern, about 170 centimetres. Although Rod Miller said six foot. They said he looked relaxed. That's it. Fuck all. Where's his day book? Could've taken it. Some kind of souvenir maybe, but I don't know. This windscreen glass - from the killer's car? We're guessing Rod Miller took a shot at them as they drove off. They didn't radio in? No. We weren't using Intergraph. We were on 52DVP for security's sake. In case your bandits had scanners? Trying to keep traffic to a minimum. Do you mind? What? No. I used to write down rego numbers on my hands. Nothing. Mrs Miller? Sorry to wake you. I was awake. What's wrong? Detective Inspector, what a terrible, terrible night. Sir, Graeme. Paul. Been thinking about Walsh Street. Hmm. It's been 10 years since Tynan and Eyre were murdered. I know. History repeats. I want you to head up the task force. Sir, I'm the duty inspector tonight. There are others far more experienced... You're the best investigator in the state, Paul. Pick your own team, run it your own way. We'll back you 100%. We can't afford another failure like Walsh Street. You will catch these men. Attention. Please. To all members on this channel. I am sorry to report to you that Senior Constable Rodney Miller died at the Monash Medical Centre at 0439 hours. You will catch these men. PAu: I would like you aboard Lorimer, if you're willing. You'd be running your own crew, reporting to me and Graeme Collins. Thank you. Dean Thomas is on board. Is that "Bull' Thomas's boy? How old is he? He's old enough. Donald, you know Graeme Collins, my 2IC? Graeme. How are you? So any developments, Paul? It's early days. Just wanna let you know my boys are ready and willing to man the phones if you're shorthanded. Special Operations Group swapping assault rifles for phones? Nice. When you can start? Oh, immediately. Here we go, here we go. From interstate and overseas. Family. friends. colleagues and strangers gathered to farewell Sergeant Gary Silk. It was a heartbreaking return to the academy from which he graduated 13 years ago. Outside. Thousands heard Ian Silk tell of his brother's dedication to the force. Finally. the utimate honour - shouder to shouder for more than a kilometre. Hundreds of officers reflected on the utimate sacrifice they're all at risk of being asked to pay. ?? He will my shield And portion be... Premier Jeff Kennett had for the killers this message. Just be assured that all the resources of the state will be brought to bear to find you out and to bring you to trial. Endures... I can't promise an arrest. But what I can offer is a guarantee that we will never stop trying to find them. We can't ask for more than that. Gary wouldn't expect more than that. No, nor would Rod. He understood how difficult investigations can be. PAu: You know the score. If we don't identify the offenders within 48 hours, it could take years. I need a team that can run all day, people who never get tired of chasing the ball - is that you? Yes. Uh, Dean Thomas, everyone. Remember, you are working for your mates, not just Gary Silk and Rod Miller. You are working for every serving officer in Victoria. You're also working for Constable Damian Eyre... ...and Constable Steve Tynan. You know their names. 10 years ago, they were murdered in cold blood in Walsh Street, South Yarra. And we never locked anyone up for that one. This time, we will. I've asked these gentlemen to help us. Introduce yourselves, please. We're from Armed Robbers. Mark Butterworth. Steve Beanland. Joe D'Alo. Hamada was our op, and before anybody says we're responsible, we already know that. No matter how hard you blokes work to solve this thing, we'll work harder - that's a promise. Graeme. OK... the first rule of Taskforce Lorimer is do not assume anything. You check everything. You check everything twice. At this moment, we've got twin lines of inquiry. First of all, we've identified the killer's car as being a dark Hyundai hatchback. But what's the first rule of Lorimer? Do not assume anything. Right. The second one is why these gentlemen are here. Catch the restaurant bandits, we catch our killers. Your time starts now. ? I'm a snake charmer. Baby Tin whistle in my hand... Police! Don't move! Get down on the ground now! ? Said I'm a snake charmer. Darling Tin whistle in my hand... Dickheads! Don't move! Down on the floor! Oh, you didn't do it, huh? Hey? What did you do? I'll tell you what you can fucking do! Two fucking mates went out there and they're fucking dead! Yeah! So nobody knows who these pricks are. Someone does. Wife, girlfriend, fence. We've shut down every crook in Melbourne. Well, all they've gotta do is give us a name and we'll back off. And how can they give them up if they don't know who the hell they are? Huh? I'm taking you back to the night of Saturday the 15th. So you're parked outside BBC Hardware and you're watching the restaurant across the road. Can you see its name? The Silky Emperor. Can you remember the car's numberplate, Frank? At first, we thought it was the same Honda back again. But it was a different car. How tall would you say he was? About 170 centimetres. Shoulder-length dark hair. There's stubbly growth. Six foot. Check shirt. Yeah. Hmm. Now, Gary was shot three times. First shot to the chest. Second shot to the pelvis, smashing a vertebrae. Third shot to the skull... ...was fatal. The second and third round was from a different gun. Two shooters? Or one man with two guns. Rod was shot once. The bullet entered his body under his left armpit and exited at his right hip. Explain the trajectory. Well, the theory is Rod was at the back of the Hyundai. He had the gunman inside the car shooting over the top of the front seat through the rear window. First shot smashes the glass. Rod ducks down. Second shot... ...hits him. Anything helpful with the bullets? No. They're twisted out of shape from impacting on bone. They're useless. However, Rod did return four shots, but we've only recovered three, so I figure the final round might've lodged in the Hyundai's bodywork. Too much to hope it lodged in someone's skull. It's definitely Korean manufacture. The Japs use a thicker glass and generally tint it. So it's probably a Hyundai Excel, either 3- or 5-door. That's great work, Mick. Thanks. And how many out there? About 35,000 registered in Australia. Wouldn't you be wise to add more experience to the team? It's all about fresh thinking. Yeah, well, some of them look like schoolkids, Paul. It's like a football team. Older players don't always work as hard for the kicks as the young guns. I've told them they're getting their weekends off and to take leave when it's due. So you're worried about burnout. Well, you can only run on adrenaline for so long. And passion's running pretty high at the moment. I've sent a team to South Korea to research Hyundais. What's that gonna cost? Fine. It's fine. Whatever you need. Just get me a result, Paul. I went out on a limb for you. July 18 was the Green Papaya and August 15 the Silky Emperor. Now, the Green Papaya was the "Lucifer' crack, yes? Yeah. When the cops turn up, tell them Lucifer was here. In July, he throws down a challenge to us. In August, he works up to murder. Does our Lucifer have a grudge against police? Let's look at everybody who's lodged a complaint with Ethical Standards, the ombudsman, that sort of thing. Yeah. What if these guys aren't the restaurant robbers? You know, what if it's unrelated? I mean, they could be, uh, I don't know, interstate drug runners who just happened to be in the area. Hey, skip, got a report of a girl who just bought a replacement rear windscreen for a Hyundai Excel. PAu: Aha! That's it. Number eight. Detective Sergeant Ritchie, Lorimer Taskforce. Who owns this vehicle? Me. Why? And what's your name? Nicole Debs. Nicole, has this vehicle been damaged recently? Nuh. Well, then why was a rear windscreen purchased for it yesterday? Look, it was Dad who busted it. Your dad? What happened? Yeah, his wagon was in for a service, so he needed to borrow mine to do a tiling job. I don't know what happened. He said he had these long tiling things, like metal strip things, in the back, sticking out. Slams the hatch on 'em and smashes the window to bits. Why didn't you say so in the first place? So your dad, what's his name? Bandali Debs. Everyone calls him Ben. Great. He's not home. Got his mobile number? He's not got it with him today. You just tell him we called. Yeah, don't you worry. I will. PAu: I know Bandali Debs. He's nothing. A low-level thief. He's a bottom feeder. Yeah, you got him on a handling charge back in '79. I was in uniform. You must've been in nappies. So, what, forget about him? No, Mick, you don't forget about him. You get a statement out of him. Check every detail - twice. Hey, shut the fuck up! Oi! Oi! Quiet, you little bitch! Come here, girl. It's alright. Yeah, me daughter told me youse was here. So could you tell us how you broke the windscreen, Mr Debs? Uh, yeah, well, me wagon was off the road, so I had to use hers to do this job over in Jaguar Close. And I had this... these fuckin' brass tiling strips in the back and it was too long for the car. When I slammed the hatch, they went straight through the back window. And when was this? Uh... last Wednesday. What were you doing on the 15th? That was the night them cops got shot. Mm-hm. Uh... I did a job in Noble Park during the day and then I just kicked back with the family and had a few brews. Any objection if we take a look at your phone records? Why? Oh, it's just something we like to do. If I can find them. We'll arrange to pick them up. OK, read and sign this if it's correct, sir. Colleague heard a whisper about an individual who was in Moorabbin on the night of the 15th. "Colleague'? Meaning fellow sex offender or fellow murderer? I'm told this individual was driving a stolen dark blue Honda Civic. He was pursued by your colleagues, if I have it right. And does this "individual' have a name? Depends on what you want to put on the table. I have a list of what I consider to be totally reasonable requests. Fuck is...? Go, go, go, go, go! Jesus! Don't move! Don't move! Stay there! Police! Get down! What the hell...? I break and enter into cars for a living, yeah? It's how I earn a quid. That what you were doing in the Silky Emperor car park? Working? I was cruising round the car park looking for stock. Suddenly, I spot this VS Commodore with two blokes in it. Cops! So I got out of there pretty quick. Commodore stuck with me for a bit, and then I lost him on Warrigal Road. Did you happen to come back an hour later, then, for another look? No! I was at home shitting myself. Plus, I heard all that "shots fired" stuff on the scanner. Yeah, well, this is the time to come clean, mate. Don't plead not guilty and then have us prove you're lying, 'cause judges, they hate that shit. I'm not lyin'! Did you shoot Gary Silk and Rod Miller? No! It's not in my nature. Oh! "Blood will flow"? Shooting cops sounds exactly your speed. Oh, that's bullshit. I'm a thief, man. Pssh! We'll need blood and hair for DNA testing. Oh, and your earwax. Earwax? Mmm. Why? Well, your filthy ear preserves gunshot residue for months. This is gonna cost 20 million by the time we're done. Do you reckon we'd go to the same amount of trouble if they weren't cops? We're protecting the uniform... ...the thin blue line between order and chaos. Update on our Nazi car thief. He was home in bed when the shots were fired. He's got a neighbour with insomnia and a telescope. Haven't you people got homes to go to? Wanna hear something weird? Nicole Debs just bought another rear window for her car. Another one? What happened was I installed the first one myself. I used silicon. "Great job, Ben," I thought. Except that the bastard blew out when Nicole was driving it. Isn't that right, kitten? Hey, what are you doing having a stickybeak? Go back inside. Next time, we'll get a professional to install the little fucker. And don't forget - you still owe me, Dad. So did you manage to round up those phone records we asked for? Yeah, I'll just go and get them for you. Ta. Bang! Bang! Shh! Inspector, when do you expect to make an arrest? I can't say. I don't have a crystal ball. Well, how long are you gonna keep looking for these men? Months? Years? As long as it takes. Inspector! Paul, John Silvester from the "Age'. Do you think your taskforce is gonna be better resourced and better supported than Walsh Street was? I'm not here to discuss Walsh Street. Well, is that a yes or a no? We have everything we need. Thank you. Is that all we get? When I have something to say, I'll say it. Inspector! Inspector! We're reporting here live from the steps at police headquarters. That was Paul Sheridan... Paul. Not only do we have to do this one better than Walsh Street, we have to be seen to do it better. Walsh Street was a mess because there was no clear chain of authority. Too many chiefs, too many conflicting opinions. That's why I wanted you and you alone talking to the media - regularly. Even if I've got nothing to say? Paul, two coppers are dead. The public wants to know what we're gonna do about it, so does the Chief, so does the Minister, so does the Premier. Now, would it kill you to release the occasional harmless snippet of information? Graeme, if you want a PR campaign, I'm not the man. Put the Bandali Debs case to me. Alright. Debs has a proven record of dishonesty. I point to his 1979 conviction for handling. Further to that, three years ago, he pleaded guilty to stealing that spare wheel from the car yard at Ferntree Gully. He received a bond and no conviction was recorded, but it's worth noting that he led the police on a chase through three suburbs before he was caught. Now, his daughter Nicole owns a dark blue Hyundai Excel which is an exact match for our missing vehicle. Coincidence? Who's to say that he isn't our bloke? Against. Skip, Ben Debs is a tradesman who works for a living. He's got a wife, he's got five kids and a mortgage, and a dog named Pebbles. Is that the profile of a cop killer? He... he pays his taxes, he pays his bills. He bought the Hyundai quite legitimately for his daughter Nicole's 18th birthday. Is that the profile of a guy that cold-bloodedly murders two cops just to avoid being questioned for minor robbery matters? I mean, surely, if he was our guy, the first thing he'd do is dispose of the car, right? No match. Let's find out who's right. Put the dogs on him. ? Up there, Cazaly ? In there and fight! ?? Fly like an angel You're... Fuckin' Christ! What happened. Mate? Oh. God! Oh. Your thumb! Oh! Let's have a look. Oh. fuck! Oh. it's alright. Ahh! OK. Good ony a. Darl. Here's your... See y a! A petty thief maybe, but public enemy number one? Nah! I still wanna see the car. You'd better not put one fuckin' scratch on it, mate. BANDALl: For the fuckin' umpteenth time, I parked the car, I pulled out a bucket of black-label glue and some other stuff from the back... Did you hear what I said? Not one scratch. ...tools and shit. And I was in a hurry, I remember, and I slammed the hatch - bang! There was fucking glass everywhere. Where exactly? In the back. It all just went fuckin'... fuckin' crashed down in the back. You know, bloody mess. And then I drove home and then I gave Nicole the money to buy a new one. Yeah, he did. Which you fitted. Yeah, which blew out a few days later. Oh, and I remember something else. I know where those cops got shot. What do you mean? You know that Chink restaurant? The, um, th-the Silky, uh, thingummyjig. The Silky Emperor. Yeah. I did a job there a few years back. I tiled their bloody kitchen. The rear windscreen fragments from Nicole Debs's Excel don't match the samples from Cochranes Road. That means it's not her car. This is not the killer's Hyundai. What are you looking at me for? Find me a killer. First time in here? No, of course not. She's gorgeous, eh? Yeah. That your sister, is she? Guess who was warming a table at Foodies that night. "Foodies'? What's Foodies? The hamburger joint across the road from the Korean BBQ. Nik "The Russian' Radev... ...and a mate of his they call Greaseball. Radev? I thought Radev was in stir. Nope. Paroled three weeks earlier. My informant's grandson is mixed up in his amphet business. He says Radev was there to make a deal. Hi. How are you? Two black coffees with milk, thanks. Yep. Fucking jack. Look at him. Narc? How the fuck would I know? Shall I ask him? No. Uh, yeah. So, uh, what time do you knock off? Sorry? What time do you finish? Um, well, why are you asking? Well, there's some mean and nasty hombres around these parts. Oh. Yeah, it's OK. I'm... a big girl. Good to know. There you go. Thank you. OK. Alright. Nice to meet you. You too. Word is, two hours later, Radev hunted Rod and Gary down. They drove into the car park of the Silky Emperor just to lure them out? Why kill two police just because they interrupt a drug deal? Well, maybe there was more to it. Well, did Gary ever bust him? I'm not sure. Two weeks later, there was an aggravated burg on a house in Northcote. Do you remember it? Three offenders in balaclavas. It was a shakedown. One of them shoved a gun in a five-year-old's mouth. That's right. Special Response are looking at Radev. So the reckless act of a man who's already killed two cops. His weapon of choice? A Bulldog. 38 - the right calibre. OK, so, car pulls up here under this broken streetlight - deliberately. The driver waits in the vehicle till the cop car pulls up behind them and Gary and Rod get out. Rod stays at the back of the car. Gary comes to the front to speak with the driver. Gary then crosses to the front of the car. Passenger steps out. Rod pulls out his firearm, takes shots at the passenger fleeing. Driver then jumps into the car, grabs his pistol. Why? Well, maybe Gary didn't realise what he'd stumbled across. And maybe Radev assumed that he did. So we bring them in? Apply the blowtorch to their hairy bellies. Just Radev. Divide and conquer. Police! Don't move! Police! Freeze! Get down! Get down! Get down! Don't move. Get down! Piss off. G'day, mate. I told you. I lost my gun. After you killed two police officers? What for I kill policemen for? You tell us, Radev. I tell you go have good fuck with yourself. What happened at Foodies, hmm? You saw Sergeant Silk. What happened? Did you enjoy putting a gun in a child's mouth? I know nothing about this thing. Your mate Greaseball said you did. OK. I tell you who killed police. Mm-hm. You forget about this thing. We have deal. No, I don't do deals. Read that for me - aloud. "Tell them "Luchi'... " "Lucifer'. Lucifer. "Tell them Lucifer was here. " You tell me the truth... while it counts. Greaseball. What? Come on, fuck. You know this fat fuck, Greaseball. Fat fuck. Leave me alone! What do you want?! You have the wrong man. I tell you, you have the wrong man. You don't want to talk to us, Mr Greaseball, huh? Nikolai Radev lies! Right. Because Nikolai Radev knows who the real killer is. Oh, yeah? Surprise us. Nikolai Radev! Oh, OK. Well, they're both bloody compulsive liars and they hate each other's guts, so you can't trust a word they say. But, you know, you can't rule them out. What's their motivation? Hatred. Killing a cop. You know you'd bring the biggest shower of shit on your head. You think these idiots stopped to consider the consequences? Not the right guys, then, eh? Go back to your desk. You've got your own work to do, yes? Well, how you been keeping? Oh, OK, considering. Jimmy's not sleeping doesn't help. Guess all you can do is just take it one day at a time. Mm-hm. It's a clich, I know, but... How's progress your end? It's a little slower than we'd like. But I'm hoping Santa might bring us something special, though. I'm sorry - I can't say any more. Well, merry Christmas anyway. You've got to have faith at this time of year, don't you? Yes. Oh! He could grow up to be anything, couldn't he? Prime minister, Nobel prizewinner, captain of Carlton. Carlton? He'd have Roddy spinning in his grave. He won't even remember him. You can tell him his father was respected by every single member of Victoria Police. I was working - um, hospital not far from here. I work as a nurse and I'd just finished my shift. Um... Who does she belong to? Radev. Regular customer. Says that she saw him at 12:15 that night to buy some pills - personal use only. 12:15. Where? Service station in Warrigal Road. Says that she had to go the long way around 'cause there were too many cops in the area. So, immediately after committing a double murder, police swarming all around the place, he takes time out to do a hundred-dollar drug deal? And, yeah... Out you go, mate. Imagine this. Imagine a plank of wood this wide lying on the ground. What if I asked you to walk the length of it without stepping off or touching the ground? Could you do it? Course you can. Every single time. But what happens if we suspend that plank of wood a hundred feet in the air and we ask you to do it again? You can't do it, can you? You can't do it because you're scared of falling. Fear of failure... ...is the rust that corrodes commitment and endeavour. Once a team believes it's gonna lose, it does lose. You understand? Yes! Yes. Yeah. You want me to tell you how to catch these crooks? Yeah. You want me to tell ya? The thing is, they're not. Sorry? Crooks. Professional crooks. You already know the answer. You were taught the answer at the academy. They're doing it for fun. Those robberies last year. And they netted, what, 30-odd grand? Just over. And it's working for your team mates. Lucifer's in it for the kicks. That's how you win. BANDALl: Where are you going? Wherever you're going. Jump in. We'll talk about it. Oh... In memory of Sergeant Gary Michael Silk, registered number 24685, and Senior Constable Rodney James Miller, registered number 29276, tragically shot and killed in the performance of their duty at Moorabbin on the 16th day of August, 1998. PAu: We're going to start again - go back to the beginning, look at the crime scene again, the victims again, the robberies, the killers' cars. Forget everything you think you know. Look at it as a clean sheet. Sheet. Too hard for you? No, I was just... Leave now. Go. Well, I was just joking... I told you I wanted stayers. Yeah, but... I'm serious. Go, now. Good luck with the rest of your career. Today is day one. Captain Bligh. Captain Bligh! I feel old. You look old. Old and beaten down. And sick. Get fucked. You and the horse that you rode in on. And the horse you rode in on! How exactly do we start again? Do we go back to last year, pull out robbery number one again? Last year? Robbery number one's seven bloody years ago, junior. First time Lucifer went around. How many robberies in that first lot? 28? Yeah, so what are we gonna do? Drag every last bastard out again and look at all the witness statements? There'll be millions. You remember that one where that bloke chucked a tinnie at that robber's car? Arsehole! Palm Beach restaurant, Patterson Lakes, October something, 1994. The famous Mark Butterworth photographic memory. Waste of a perfectly good tinnie. Arsehole! Get back here! 86. 86. Backs onto 92. And ended up on the... Page 70. We end up there. What are we... There was something funny about that getaway car. Remember, Mark? Yeah, it belonged to a gorilla. A gorilla? Mmm. Jason Manuel Ghiller. 18 years old, tyre fitter. Saturday October 8, 1994. Mm-hm. Jason Manuel Ghiller drives his four-door Laser to the Nu Hotel in Dandenong for a few drinks and bumps into an old mate. An hour later, he offers the mate and his girlfriend a lift home, goes outside, car's gone. Stolen, he claims to police later. Yep. Definitely suss. That sounds OK to me. But you're young and trusting and naive. And you're wearing your fuckin' Homicide tie! You're an Armed Robber, son. You don't wear poofy Homicide ties! A, when he was interviewed, the general impression was that Ghiller, the gorilla, only pretended to be shocked when told the car was used in a robbery. B, he bought another car almost immediately, with cash. Doesn't even bother to wait and see if the old one's recovered. C, he matches the description of the second Palm Beach robber. And that's when the first series of robberies stopped? Yep, for whatever reason. How old was he? 17? I mean, maybe he just got shit scared and bailed out. From the mouths of babes. Didn't know you boys could read. Hey, that top number. I recognise it. Whose is it? Dunno. That kid Ghiller's most frequently dialled. We think Debs and Ghiller were the original robbers. Then Ghiller got a scare, lost his nerve. And last year, found himself a new partner. Debs is Lucifer. Why doesn't his car match the glass on Cochranes Road? Is it possible you made a mistake? These are highly sophisticated scientific instruments. It is not guesswork. How many pieces of glass did you recover from the Debs Hyundai? I was on leave. 53. How many did we actually test? Theoretically, it's only necessary to test a few. How many? Three. How about we go back and retest all 53, Edward? A second round of window tests indicate that the Debs Hyundai cannot be ruled out after all. According to the refractive index, half the fragments are consistent with gunshot damage, which puts Bandali Debs back into the frame. And for that we can thank the Armed Robbers. Thanks, boys. Hey, bags I'm there for the arrest. I said we can't exclude Debs. We are light years away from arresting him. Our task now is to prove whether or not he is our Lucifer. Graeme. OK, I'm gonna ask you to swear an oath of silence. No-one's to know that we're looking for Debs. I mean no-one. Once the warrants are through, we're gonna off his phone and install LDs in his house, his cars, his kids' cars, his garage, and three foot up his arse if he looks the other way long enough. The idea is to catch him bragging about the night that he took out two cops. Let's get to work. Alright, come on. Let's go. That's a nice dress. God, he'll be bloody... Come on! Yes! We're... You, young lad, you're coming with me. Where's the other one? The I... Go! Oh, come on! Alright. Leave it. For God's sake. BANDALl: Come on. Yeah, I'll just follow you. Just follow her. Did your father say what time he was gonna be home? What do I look like, his fuckin' social secretary? Jeez, you've got a mouth on you, and you didn't get it from me. Hello. Hi, Reet. It's me. How are you doin'? Don't ask. Dot. My chilblains are playing up again. Oh, no, again? Listen to this, listen to this. Can you play that back? Have a listen to this. Right? Jeez. You've got a mouth on you. and you didn't get it from me. Hello. Hi. Reet. It's me. How are you doin' Don't ask. Dot. My chilblains are playing up again. Oh. No. Again? Oh. I can't hardly bloody w alk today. Now, this is Dorothy Debs, on the phone to Rita Ghiller. It's Jason Ghiller's mum, OK? Do you know what Mama used to do with hers? Yeah. I've tried rubbing them with raw onion... Um, "Mama'? They're sisters? Sisters-in-law? No, they're sisters, apparently. This means if Debs is Lucifer, then his first partner was his own bloody nephew. And he replaced him with... ...his daughter's boyfriend. BANDALl: Oh, keep your hands up, you cockhead moron! Can we watch something else, please? Hey, Ben, you know them townhouses where I'm working? Ben? What? The townhouses I'm workin' on. Oh, the ones over in Warrandyte? What about 'em? It's not Warrandyte, ya fuckhead. It's Wantirna. God help us. It's fuckin' open house. No security. All you gotta do's cut the fence and walk in, walk out with your arms full. Fuckin' beautiful, Ben. Very interesting. Squeeze those pimples. You coud end up with scars. KERRl-ANNE KENNERLE Y ON TV: A Logie winner. AFI winner. You name it. My next guest has done everything. In this magazine are doing that. It's never me! Got a headache? Maybe... Why? 'Cause I don't want to. Oh, come on. You're so annoying. KERRl-ANNE KENNERLE Y ON TV: ... live videotape that was in Melbourne. While in Brisbane. She starred in the world premiere of the play... BANDALl: So, how's that new job going, mate? OK. I like Hungry Jacks. Burgers are better than at Macca's, don't you reckon? Yeah. Hey, do you know where they keep the safe at that joint? Yeah. Well, maybe I'll knock it over. What do you reckon? Have they got cameras? You know, CCTV? Yeah. Oh, it won't matter if we're wearing masks. I reckon clown masks would be the way to go. What do you reckon? Or how about Ronald McDonald? "Kiss the floor, kids!" Give 'em nightmares for life. Give it to the manager, big-time. What, you don't like him? Nah. He's an arsehole. Well, maybe I could single him out for special attention. What do you reckon? Cut off his finger. Would you like me to do that? Yeah. BANDALl: I'm worried about that boy. Gotta put a rocket up his arse to get a civil word out of him. It's a phase. All teenagers go through it. The girls never did. Yeah, well, that's 'cause they were too busy suckin' up to their daddy. Guess what? I got a fat. Too bad. I said... I'm not in the mood. BANDALl: Where are you going? Gippsland. Gippsland? What a coincidence! I'm going there too. Yeah? Get in. Thanks. There you go. Oh. Oh, right. ?? Gippsland, Gippsland We're both off to Gippsland. You don't often see girls... ...hitchhiking on their own. You got a boyfriend? Ja. Yes. Ja, ja. Yeah, I'll bet you do. I'll bet they are all over you like flies. I'm... I'm John. Sabrina. Hello, Sabrina. That's a pretty name for a pretty girl. I like European girls. Very honest with your needs. I'm very honest with my needs too. Shit. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Fuck! Hey! Help! Once I w alked in and I said. "Get down on the fuckin' floor!" And they all just fell down like spaghetti. GET DOWN ON THE GROUND! You know how when you pick up spaghetti and it just... it just drops? Ohh. But it's no good when you laugh. Yeah. No. No, serious. Because you know why? They get confident. Yeah, yeah. Hey, remember that sheila playing around on them chairs, laughing her head off? Nah. No, that wasn't me that time, Ben. It wasn't you? Nuh. Oh, yeah. She, uh... she thought I was joking. And she wouldn't lie down. I shoulda put the rod in her mouth and blown her fuckin' brains out. There's no noise. Swear to God. Ya just stick it in and click. All there is is just skin splattered everywhere. Fuck. July '94, Casey's restaurant, Berwick. One of the victims, a woman, thought it was a joke and she refused to lie down on the floor. It's Debs and Nicole's boyfriend, Jason Roberts, talking yesterday. Well, we've nailed him. The problem is, Mark, that this isn't actual proof that he killed Silk and Miller. The car, this, the Jason Ghiller link. Are you seriously suggesting we have got the wrong man? I need him to spell it out explicitly, unambiguously, otherwise we may as well just call this Walsh Street mark II. Hey. Merry Christmas. Thanks. Who taught you basic right and wrong, Graeme? Your parents? Oh, I suppose so, yeah. I mean, the family unit. That's where it all begins, isn't it? But you can't blame your parents for everything. Listen, Paul, why don't you take a few days off, eh? Spend some time with your own. That has to be the way to get to him. Through his family. Cops. What do we do? Just relax. What do we do? It's probably just a fuckin' RBT or something. What did I do? We're interested in your vehicle. You the registered owner of the vehicle? I am. Can I see your licence, please? Pop the hatch for us, please. Why? Fuckin' bullshit. What you fuckin' lookin' for? Mate, a vehicle just like this one was used in a very serious crime. Don't look at me. I'm a nurse. Right. I'm a respectable member of the community, for fuck's sake! Goodnight. Mrs Sutherland? We'd like to talk to your son. Which one? Robert. They said they w anted to talk to Robert because somebody told them that he woud know who killed two policemen. BANDALl: They said that? Then they asked me if I know anybody owns a Hyundai? Hey, I don't know cars. Then they asked if I had more children, and I said I have one boy in Melbourne. That's all I could tell them. We are not criminals. Mum, Mum, just don't worry, alright? Just... just don't worry. It's nothing, alright? Look, I'll talk to you later. Are you worried? No, I'm not worried. Not worried about a thing. Just wonder why they wanna talk to Robert. I'm not worried because I know he's on drugs. Yep. Besides, nobody's seen nothin'. BANDALl: Nobody seen a thing. One in the head. This is close to an admission. Tell that to a jury. I want someone to leak a story. We're moving the search for the Hyundai interstate because we've drawn a blank here in Victoria. Well, won't that take the pressure off them, skip? Exactly. Hopefully, they'll relax and tell us something we can use. What about... ..."one in the head?" Which means what? Shooting Gary Silk in the head, obviously. That's what it means. Any decent barrister would tear that statement to shreds. "Detective Beanland, how do we know "that Mr Debs isn't referring to a boxing match?" Now, listen to me, all of you. Whenever you think you've got enough, remember Walsh Street. We'll only get one chance... ...so think like a defence lawyer. You're the leaker. Fuckin' idiots. You're in the clear, Dad. You don't understand how they solve cases, Joanne. Sometimes, it's after 18 months, 2 years, 3 years. When they go and search places. Yeah, but what are they gonna find? Fuck-all. Them things disappeared, you know, what we used. Could they be found? Nuh. One's cut up, the other's in the fuckin' lake. Well, they're talking about guns - the disposal of a murder weapon. Which lake? Cardinia? Oh, shit, that's huge. Skip. Skip! Gotta hear this. Joanne. I don't w anna worry you or anything. But I'm telling you straight. In the next six months. We're gonna have to get rid of another two CPs. And you know why? To make the investigation go stupid. CPs? That's his word for "cops'. The daughters know all about it? ...don't you think they would've been pulling us into the police station by now? All I'm saying is that if this continues, this matter, two CPs have gotta go. Where? Lt'd have to be far. Across the other side of the city. Yeah. I'm not gonna use e-TAG or anything like that. Thanks. I mean, killing more police puts a new complexion on it. It might be just words. There's no law against talking. Thank you. There's more, sir. No. Seriously. I don't reckon there's gonna be any need. Shut up. Dorothy. What are you doing? I'm just talking to Bubs. Can't we just sit here and talk? So you talk to your daughter and tell her what's fuckin' going on, but you won't talk to your wife? Just talkin' about fuckin' shit! Well. Your tea's ready. Seriously, do you think I should get rid of the little kid and the mother? You know, the cop's wife? Make 'em start thinking it's about, you know, drugs or something else, you know? Something personal about him? Give me one good reason why we don't arrest them today. I don't have enough proof. But this strategy of yours, stirring the possums... Could get more cops killed. I vote we take them down now. It's very high-risk. How can you guarantee they won't do what they say? And it's not just members' lives we're talking about. It's a risk we have to manage, which is why I've asked Donald to join us. I need more time. We move on them now, they'll walk at committal. Can you manage it? Put a SOG unit on stand-by down the road, and the moment they look like they're tooling up, we shut 'em down. I want to see them in the Supreme Court, not the Coroners Court. Well, you do your job, and I'll do mine. Upgrade your surveillance, Paul. I wanna know where they are every minute of every day. Forget budget. It's not true you're looking for the car interstate? No, it's not. By the way, Paul, it's Valentine's Day, in case you hadn't noticed. Not too late to send the wife some flowers. Carmel, where does Jimmy go to creche? Why? There's been a threat made against you. And him. By these men? These murderers? What threat? To kill you. Are we safe? Yes. PAu ON TV: Crime Stoppers has received a call from an anonymous person who believes he can identify one of the offenders. We believe this person has a substantial degree of credibility and I woud urge him to call us again. No-one was there but us, cockhead! This is the most significant lead we've had in 20 months. Once again, I woud urge this caller to come forward. I will personally guarantee your anonymity. Your help in this matter coud be crucial in solving this crime. Thank you. That's good. Yeah. Good. Why don't we just arrest him? You know, bring him in. He's a kid. He'll give up Debs in five seconds flat. And you're prepared to gamble the entire investigation on that, are you? That's me! Every bastard who picks up this paper's gonna think it's me! I don't wanna think about this every day of my fuckin' life! What? You don't come in here! Your mother's on the phone. The cops have been bothering her again. Ooh. There's a big dinosaur, buddy, hey. Can you see him? A big T. Rex, huh? Yeah, that's right. Babies! Carmel? Hi. I'm a police officer. It's fine. There's no danger. Police? But how... how... We've been shadowing you since Valentine's Day. That's our job. I had no idea. Thank you. I didn't know Rod, but everyone says he was a top bloke. Thank you. BANDALl: We're gonna have to be really careful now with what we do. We're gonna have to watch every word, stop talking and shit, you know? Yeah. Act like everyday wankers. Yeah. Maybe I ought to go in and see 'em. Own up it looks like me. Yeah. 'Cause if it was you, you wouldn't be stupid enough to do that, would ya? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, act like a cockhead. Yeah, no worries. Seize the initiative. Oh... Very interesting situation, Jason. Yeah. That's my picture, mate. I mean, it looks exactly like me. It's pretty close, isn't it? Oh, when I saw this, I nearly had a fuckin' heart attack! Me mum went mental. I can believe it. But it's not you? Mate... Mate, I'm a chippie. Well, an apprentice. I'm no killer. We're gonna have to check you out, you realise that? Yeah, yeah, no problem, mate. Cocky little turd. Come arrest day, we'll release him immediately. Give him some time on his own without his mate Lucifer telling him what to think. He might just spill his guts to Nicole, and we'll be recording every word. One of them had to shoot first. Who's to say it wasn't Jason? But why did they have to shoot at all? Maybe that was the plan. "If ever we get pulled over, we shoot first. " Jason. can you please state your ful name for the tape? Jason Joseph Roberts. I'm just gonna ask you a few questions in relation to the deaths of... Oh, what a bunch of fuckin' cockheads! No fuckin' idea. Yeah. that's why I'm here. Mmm! You know what I done? What? When he went out of the room, I put his cup where my cup was. What, they tried to take your prints? I don't know. So I swapped the cups around anyway. Oi, it's that time again, Ben. What? Time for a job. What job? Bang, bang? I'd love to, mate, but we are red-hot. So? So we go west or something. Wear masks, hit some ching chong joint or something... Mate, the Ds are all over us. I kill Ds. I know you do. I KNOW you do. I kill Ds. "I kill Ds. " Go again. I kill Ds. "I kill Ds. " I kill detectives. Even if we could enhance the audio, how do we prove he means "detectives'? "D' could mean"dickhead'. "Dickhead'? You reckon? OK, fine. I'm going home. If you wanna sack me, sack me. BANDALl: Hello. How are you goin'? Yeah, good. You? You caught those people who did that thing? Uh, no, no, not yet. But, er, pretty positive we'll find them in the end. And what about the car? You found the car yet? No, not yet. But we're still looking. What, you live around here, do ya? Uh, no. I, um... just on the way to a mate's place, actually. I just stopped by to pick up some stuff. Oh, yeah. What about you? You keeping busy? What do you do again? Oh, I'm flat out. You know, tiling, roofing, plastering. I'm doing a job over in Mooroolbark at the moment, at KFC there. Right. Actually, I wanted to have a word again with you soon. Oh, yeah? Yeah. About that young bloke that lives with your daughter. Is it Jason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, see, a few issues have been raised about him. We've had a few calls about that photofit that got released. Ah. I'll call you, yeah? Yeah. Alright. I'll see you round. Yeah. I'm gonna find out where he lives. That stuff about him visiting a friend's bullshit. Oi, you reckon our phones are bugged? I reckon my mobile is. Why do you think that? The other day, someone calls and goes, "Hello, hello. " And they go, "Oh, got the wrong number. " Listen, any stuff you think should go from this place, you get rid of it now. You know what I mean? Fuck. It's all good stuff. If he was visiting a friend, he wouldn't have been in his jogging gear, all sweaty and stuff. I don't care what anyone fuckin' thinks. I'm gonna find out where he lives and then I'm gonna fix him up. I don't care what anyone fuckin' thinks. I'm gonna find out where he lives and then I'm gonna fix him up. We cannot stand by while this man threatens the lives of police. We need hard evidence. It's your call. It's always been your call. Let's pray we find some. Call SOG. Bring them in. What have you got on today? Quoting on a factory job in Clayton. Big bucks. Don't be late home. Five in the morning and she's whingeing already. G'day, Ben. Colin. G'day, Colin. How are ya? Thanks for coming down. No worries. This is it. What do you think? Fuck me! I'd knock the bastard down and start again. You might just be right. Sheridan. Go. PAu: It's Paul Sheridan. I wanted you to know before you saw it on tonight's news. We've got them. Daddy'd be very proud of you. What have you got to tell us? Ladies and gentlemen, today Lorimer Taskforce detectives made two arrests in relation to the murders of Sergeant Gary Silk and Senior Constable Rodney Miller. Gary and Rod. Rest in peace. Join us. Oh, they don't need me spoiling their fun. It's not a request, you dismal sod. Come on. I still don't know why they did it. Thank you. Thanks to all of you. Thank you. BANDALl: Wait till I give the word. G'day, mate. How are ya? BANDALl: Not too bad. How are you going? Got some business out here tonight, have you? BANDALl: Oh, I've just been working pretty late, you know. Got a licence I can have a look at, please?
