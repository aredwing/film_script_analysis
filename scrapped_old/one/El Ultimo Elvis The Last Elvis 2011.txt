I have an important show next Friday. We've been rehearsing a lot. Do you want to come? I'm playing "Unchained Melody", alone on the piano. I'll talk to your mom if you like. We're here. Lisa! Lisa, come here. Remember to keep a level head. Bye beautiful. Hey, Gutierrez! Gutierrez! Hey, Gutierrez! You're listening to concerts all day long. Get on with it. Come on! I'm yours, baby! Dollars, right? How much does Business cost? Hi there! Economy then. What time does it depart? August 14th. Perfect. Elvis. - Great to see you. - Freddie. Come in and have a drink. - Britney! Hi. - Hi. - Which one's ham and cheese? - No idea. The son of a bitch is making it by the barrel. Look at this house. They don't call me anymore. You're lucky, you're back again. I invented rock and roll. I was never gone. You want me to blow you? Why are you like that? Like what? Like the guy on the TV. 'Cos God gave me his voice. I just had to accept it. Listen to what he says. Amazing, isn't it? I don't know English. He says women've scratched and bitten him. But he knows they don't want to hurt him. They just want a piece of me. Guys. No I don't think so. OK. Bye. Yes, can I help you? - I'm here to get paid. - Name? What's your name? - I'm under Carlos Gutierrez. - Gutierrez... Julio... Maria... Carlos, here you are. 700 pesos. They owe me shows for the last 4 months. That's what I have. Your lunch ticket. Who is it? Elvis. - Hi - Hi Mom! I'm coming. I brought you this. Thank you. Are you coming in? Okay What's that? It' s for Lisa. Lisa! - Do you want to eat? - Okay. You're getting fat. I'm trying to put on weight. - What's that? - How about "Hello"? Hello It's for you. It's black. Didn't they have another colour? See what it does. - It doesn't do anything. - Wait. It doesn't do anything. ELVIS. I taught it. Take it off the table, I'm going to set the plates. Lisa got chosen for the school choir. Yeah, Lorena too. We're going to sing at the school concert. I don't know... ...the world of music is very tough. It's the school choir, Carlos, she's not going on tour. I'm just saying that it's a tough business. Do you want to go or not, love? Yes, I want to be with the girls. Well, we 'll talk later. Lisa... If music is what you want, I will help you, OK? ELVIS. Why are you looking at me like that? Many young artists can't take the pressure. What pressure? - You'll understand me one day. - Lower your voice! You take her to school once, and you think you're a hero. And then you bring that fucking bird. Who' s going to buy the food for the birdy? It's a mate for Lisa. Don't get jealous. Damn the night I met you. Can't you act like a father, for once? Priscilla, you'll always love me. Get off Carlos! What are you doing? - Don't call me Carlos? - What's your name, then? Sometimes I think you want to drive her nuts. Get out. Just get out. - What is it? - Get out of here. Go! Go! Carlos, can I borrow some deodorant? Thank you. To Sarah, please Come on Sarah. Do you hear me, ma? I'm about to do something big, what I always dreamed of. I want you to know that it's thanks to you and dad. You will be proud of me. You're going to see me make it. Lydia Here. This is for a few months. I don' t want her needing anything. Bye. What is it, Gutierrez? Here. Keep these. - They'll be worth millions. - What? Where are you going? He spoke in English. Did you hear that? Can you give me the eyeliner? This one is OK, it works. - Spray? You have some? - No, I have mousse. It works for you? It's really cold in here. Yeah, I'm shivering. How many people came? Not much. But they usually come late. Have you ever felt that you've done everything, that you've reached your goals? No. Still, I got a promotion at the supermarket. I don't think you're good for her, Carlos. Lisa needs somebody who talks to her, who understands her. - Not your silly songs. - What do you mean silly songs? Wait. Listen to me. A friend at work got me a lawyer and I'm asking for custody. It'll all be easier. You can visit her for Christmas and birthdays and stuff. I think it's best for Lisa. We can't take this anymore. I'm fed up. Good. Watch the chorus, the song has to be perfect. - This show is very important. - Hello. Just a moment. It has to be like the last one. I want to sing Unchained Melody. - Elvis. - Not now, I'm rehearsing. It's for you. They say it's important. Hello. What? I'm looking for my wife and daughter. Excuse me, excuse me! My wife and daughter had an accident. They told me to come here. Name and surname? Alejandra Olemberg, Lisa Marie Gutierrez. No, I can't. I said no! I can't play. Who's with Alejandra Olemberg? Your wife had an accident. She suffered cranial trauma and she's unconscious. We're running a brain scan to see if there is any damage. - Are you sure it's my wife? - Alejandra Olemberg. And my daughter? The girl is fine. Doctors are assessing her condition in the emergency ward. - Where's that? - Down the hall. She is ready. Lisa... ...shall we go? Where? You're coming with me. Isn't mom coming? No. She's staying in the hospital for a while. Let's go get the blackbird? We gave it to a neighbor. - What are they? - Banana and peanut butter. - I don't like it. It tastes funny. - Lisa Marie loved them. Is there anything else on? I have another concert if you like. It hurts. The doctor said to give me the medicine every 4 hours. It's been 7 already. - Where are they? - In my backpack. It's in your room. Where? Look around. But don't mess up my stuff. Dad. Dad. I can't sleep. What is it? Is mom going to die? What? Is mom going to die? I don't know. I'm scared. Me too. It' s been 48 hours. She's stable, but still not responding. There's no toilet, but I peed anyway. What did the doctor say? They don't know yet. Can you play pool? - Yes. Can you? - No. D'you want me to teach you? Sure. Lean on this, and you guide it with these 2 fingers. You have to hit the ball into these holes. The colored or striped one. Now move, I'm starting. Hit it with all your strength. There. Now you do it. You've got to aim at the white one, and make the cue stick go straight for the hole. No, no. - How? - Watch me do it. Great. 755. Anyone has that number? You must participate to win. 959. Stay here. I'm going to play. I can't hear a thing. - This damn sound, this damn club. - Come on Sandro! What's your problem? You come up here and sing. Lady, what are you laughing at? Fuck you lady and your fucking hairdo. And fuck this damn club! Shit. Open the door! What's the matter? Are you nuts? Don't do this. Come on, chubs. Listen. They're all waiting out there. Come on. Come on, asshole. They're waiting for you. What's wrong with you? Who do you think you are? Come on, open the door. Do you hear me? Come out! Take it easy guys. The show must go on. Fucking hell! Where were you? I had something to do. - I thought you'd gone. - No. Why did you get mad? I didn't get mad. Yes honey bun, all yours. Yes, all yours. Sure, for you of course, I've got to go. Bye. I need to get paid. It's 7 shows. We don't make payments here. You got to stand in line, like everyone else. You have to pay me now. We haven't been paying in the last 20 days... ...cos we're fixing the building. I have my daughter, and Priscilla in hospital. You have to pay me. I'm sorry. You'll have to wait like everyone else. Call before coming out here. Talk to the girls first. You have the number, don't you? - Do you know who I am? - No. Who are you? - I'm Elvis. - Elvis, from where? From Memphis, asshole. I'm going to have this place burned down. Get out. You know how many Elvises like you I have? - Which do you want? - This one. - You want an olive? - Yeah. Stay here for a while, I have something to do. - And when will you be back? - Before the show. Please. I need my job back. What happened? You left me a message. Your wife came to and she's stable. We're keeping her here for another 24 hours, and if she's okay, we're moving her to a ward. - Will she be all right? - Yes. Can I see her? In a bit. She has to rest for a while longer. It hurts. Don't worry Priscilla. They said you're going to be fine. Do you know how long you have to stay? No. I don't. - How's Lisa? - She's fine. I took her home a few days. Now she's with my mom. With your mom? I was passing a corner. And I just can't remember what happened. I didn't put her safety belt on. I didn't put it on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Tell Lisa I'm sorry. That I miss her. And I love her very much. - And when will she be back? - In a few days. But now she's better. She says she misses you. Don't you want to come, Lydia? I'm wearing the blue suit. What are you doing? Nothing. You can sleep a little more if you like. It's early. I have a present for you. What is it? And this? Where did you get it? A friend at school gave it to me. His dad had it. Thanks, beautiful. We leave it here. They made me quite thin, don't you think? How's the choir doing? I don't go anymore. I got bored. Don't worry Lisa, you'll find something that you like. You were bom with a gift, like me. You just have to find it. - Does mom have a gift too? - No, not everyone has it. I don't think she can stay here. - Please, I couldn' t stay yesterday. - Okay, just for a bit. - Can you fetch her later? - Right. What happened with the car? I almost had to pay for them to keep it. That's enough. I have to sleep. You should have benefits for artists. Some VIP room. I was out there waiting for an hour. Can I go to the show tonight? Now your mother's out, you have to stay with her. Why did you sell the TV? 'Cos I'm going on tour in a few days. It's very important for me. - But, when will you be back? - I don't know. But you'll be fine, baby. I'll miss you. Me too. When you really believe in something you have to pursue it 'til the end. Those who don't are unhappy. I want you to be proud of your father. My boss told me they're going to pay me the months I couldn't work. Great. Ma, can we make some banana sandwiches? Gross! Bye, precious Bye. Let's go honey. I want to hire a limo. White. For tomorrow. Elvis... Presley.
