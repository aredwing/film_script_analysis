Don't touch me! Help! Help me! Watch out! Stupid! No! No... Don't touch me! So all your stuff is here? You're heading to Tokyo after spending time on vacation. Yes. Can I see your driver's license? How are you doing? Do you feel like telling the truth? I already told you. We met at the drive-in restaurant. We fell in love at first sight. Don't lie. It's time to tell the real truth. Look. I don't have any money. Why do you think I was selling my body for sex? You are hiding it somewhere. Eh? Hey... you! Look for it anywhere. Eh? Do you know where you're at? The police station! - Where is it hidden? - Go away. Get dressed and leave. Disrespect. Detective... will you hook this for me? Quit joking You have no respect for the police. Thank you. Well... bye bye now. While driving through the woods, you met the truck driver. He chased you into the forest and caught you. Yes. Then what did he do? I don't remember. It's impossible not to remember. Were you wearing your underpants afterwards? Did you remove them, or did he? I wouldn't have done it. Did he use his left or right hand to remove them? I don't know. Why don't you think about it carefully? I really don't remember... 'cause I was scared and upset. Really? If such rapist truly exists... we need your information to arrest him. Did you say "if"? He exists! Try one more time. Yes. After he took your underwear, did he ejaculate? Did you see his erection? I'm asking you. I don't know. Was there foreplay involved? Do you know about foreplay? Did he use his fingers? Did he use saliva? Or not? Did he rape you from the front or from the back? Really... in that type of case, we often discover... despite the girl's claim, it was consensual sex. We have to be careful. Hey you! Don't trust them. They won't find him. I may know the guy who raped you. I could take you to him. We could drag him to the cops. Then they can't doubt you. Don't worry. He'll be here. He always hangs out here. Do you have a cigarette? I'm going to the restroom. - May I take the plates? - Yes. Hey... why are you so dressed up? Are you running away with some guy? I'd run away with you. Then let's run away for a couple of hours. Jump in. Are you feeling good, or what? You get on me this time. Don't you love it? Make some sexy noises. I said get on top of me. You're pulling my neck. That hurts. C'mon, make the sound. Scream. Car problems? I can take a look at it. My station is very close. Jump in. Come on. Do you think you can fix it? Will it be alright? This one is a bit involved. I can do it tomorrow morning. Are you worried about where to stay? Stop. Stop the car. - It's a love hotel... - But there's nothing else here. This way. Please. Here's the key. Enjoy your stay. Get comfortable. - What about the guy? - She's by herself. Oh? That's rare. Are you disappointed? How about the other rooms? She's the only guest tonight. I was looking forward to this. What a disappointment. You can't have sex without watching? That disappoints me. Well... well... don't make fun of me. I'm still young. - She's watching us. - Eh? What are you doing? I'm showing off for her. Impossible. She can't see us. - She's crying - Yes. Madam... do you have a key? Nasty boy. Here. Easy. Easy. Eh? What are you doing here? I just wonder why you're here by yourself. Eh? No! Don't touch me! No! No! Stop it! No! - Please, can you open the hood? - Yes. Here's the breakdown. I will send the rest from Tokyo. Then I must keep your car. You can't do that. What are you doing? Then... You can drive your car, but... Let me out! - How's your business? - So, so. - OK, bye. - Yeah. Bye bye. What happened to you? You look awful. I'm sorry for borrowing your stuff without telling you. Why don't you change your clothes inside? You're under bad luck. Have you finished eating? Hey, girl. I haven't seen you for a while. Are you doing OK? Eh? Do you have time? OK with me. - But what about her? - Eh? She's still a virgin. Is that true? She's very cute. Hey... do you want to take my place? What do you mean? Have a quickie with this gentleman. You don't have any money. I can't. I'm not... I'm sorry. She can't give up her virginity yet. I'm so disappointed. Then I have no other choice. Bad attitude. - Can you wait for me there? - Sure, see you... Keep that. I'll get some money right now. See you later. Wait a minute. What's wrong? Don't make me wait. Not yet. Patient. Do it. Quickly. Sorry to scare you. But you turned down a dead end road. - Thank you very much. - No problem. What are you doing? Don't touch me! What happened to you? Such a serious wound. Right. Does it still hurt? - A little. - Then... The pain will go away after some sleep. Rest in the clinic for a while. Be quiet. Somebody help me! Nobody's there! You must pay my fee. If you don't pay, I'll call the police. Answer me. Enough of your fabrications. We have a signed complaint from the doctor. You tried to run away without paying your bill. That's not true. How awful! Really? Then give me the details on how the doctor raped you. Did the doctor do this? And then, did he do this? Your screaming does not help at all. Nobody will come here. Let me go! Wait. Don't panic. We can't be obvious. Damn it. You again! What's wrong with you? When I don't catch any client for the night, I sleep here. Come in. You're stupid... If I were you, I'd have used this thing. They would've been in trouble over it. If you don't do anything or say anything... people take advantage of you. That's how the world is. If you become like me, you've reached the end too. You say your car is in front of the clinic? The cops will have it staked out. Where are you going? To work. You need money to get out of here. Hey... Do you have a cigarette? Here. - Mister... you look new to me. - What? It's very late, so I can give you a special. What do you mean? You don't have to act naive. Here. You are under arrest for prostitution. You've been a difficult case, but now you'll go to jail. No business at all last night. Sorry to be a bother. No other choice. You've got to get your car. Cops will be there. Give me the gun, I'll pretend I found it on the street. Please take care of it. Eat. Let's do it. - Just as you requested. - Hey... How about the girl? - She went to the back like I suggested. - That's good. By the way, can you really make the new guy back off? Alright. Alright. Don't worry. All right. Let's cut her off. Again. Do it. Slut!
