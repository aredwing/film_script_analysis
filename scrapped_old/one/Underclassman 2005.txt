I been messin' up all my life, Droped out of high school | a month before graduation, broke my dad's heart, He said I wouldn't amount to anything | if I didn't get an education, Andthatman meanttheworldto me. I was nothin' | but a disapointment to him, Look, Rob's a good kid, man, | He's just mixed up in a bad situation, It makes no sense | that he would boost cars, There's something else goin' down, | and I'm gonna prove it, The Aronia bush, a deciduous shrub which produces | wonderful succulent black chokeberries that can be harvested | at this time of year, There are some growing on the west side | of campus down by the old storage facility. (vehicle approaches) (bad Spanish accent) | Say hello to my little friend, (car stops outside) (boys' voices) - (Rob) You're overreacting, | - (Bos) lsn't it convenient?

What are we gonna say? | That he blackmailed us? Our part of the deal is done, From now on, we're clean, All we have to | do is lay low and everything will be all right, Just lay low, That's the plan? Let's go, (door closes) A stain on Warren Williams' shirt | was tested by forensics, - It turned out the stain was,,, | - From an Aronia bush, We know this, Those trees are | as common as BMWs in Westbury, - It could have come from anywhere, | - Right, including on campus, I was lookin' around on where | those trees are, and I found this, You found a pen on a campus? | That's amazing, Pay attention, Rob's name was written in | red ink on that notepad found at the scene, I bet if you test this, you'll find | Warren's prints and an ink match, - Kid was there, He was onto something, | - All right, what else you got? I saw a gang of covered cars | being hauled off on a truck, I followed the tracks, | It led me to a garage housing car racks, - You saw the stolen cars? | - Nah, but,,, I saw this, It's the same customized cap | from the Murdock bust, You think this has to do with drugs? I can't prove it, but I got a hunch it has | something to do with drugs and cars, Rob and his boys are just pupets, | Somebody else is pulling the strings, You got me up in the middle of the night | to come down here for a hunch? Sometimes hunches | are how cases are solved, - You're wasting my time, baby face, | - Look, G, I get it, I look young, you look chunky, | It's not about that right now, I need your help, Together we can make this hapen, If what you say is true, we'll find out | when we question Donovan, - What are you talking about? | - His prints were in the captain's garage, As soon as we get the green light | from the commish, we're movin' on him, (knock on door) (louder knocking) You better have a very good reason | for wakin' me up at 6am, - I brought you your paper, | - I get it delivered, - I brought it from the driveway, | - Esta tan viejo como Friegas. Hey, I know what you sayin', | No need for name-callin', What are you doing here, Tre? I came by to ask you to hold off | on bringin' Donovan in, Let Gallecki scope out the school, | My report says,,, Hey, Unless you're talkin' about your book | report, I don't wanna hear about it, Cap, my dad used to say if you don't stand | for something, you'll fall for anything, If you arrest Rob, | you ruin this kid's whole future, You should be thinkin' about your future, | Go to school, Learn something, Tre, Dad also used to say if I needed someone, | I could turn to you, Guess he was wrong about that, If she can't take your needs,,, Hey, - 'Sup? | - Let's take a ride, You know how to use one of these? Shoot, the basketball court | ain't the only place I'm a sure shot, Yo, man, what we doin' out here? I read a really interesting chapter | in my history book about Benedict Arnold, He made some good eggs, No, he was a trusted and admired general | in the Revolutionary War, But then he turned his back | and fought for the enemy, - I'm sure he had his reasons, | - No, you never betray your men, Sometimes it's the right choice, What do you say we end this now, | so no one else gets hurt? - No, I can't just surrender now, | - Have it your way, How's it goin', boss? | Cars went off right on schedule, Good, Good, Look, a small problem | has arisen that I need you to take care of, Boscoe has given me | some unfortunate information concerning that new student | Tracy Stokes, So, (man) What, you want us to,,,? You're kidding, right? We're cool moving product for you, | but we're not,,, 1 2 months ago, | I was given a golden oportunity to make up for the thankless years | I've devoted to Westbury with its spoiled darlings | and their daddies' millions, I can understand that, but we're not,,, Tomorrow night sees the culmination | of all our hard work, and I will allow no one to stand in the way | of what is coming to me, So, please, less of the "drug dealers with | scruples" routine and just do as you're told, Hm?

Be sure to hit the shitter | before you go this time, too, (phone rings) Yeah, - Everything on schedule? | - (Tre) Yo, Rob, (Powers) Very good, | See you shortly, I know you think you have nobody | to turn to, but you can turn to me, What are you, my peer counselor? I'm a cop, - I thought you were my friend, | - Man, I am your friend, Unless you let me know what's goin' on, | I can't help you, We pulled a senior prank - | hot-wired Powers' car, and we totaled it, - He'd expel us unless we boosted,,, | - Boosted the cars for him, It would have ruined my life, What about Warren? He was investigating the thefts, He must have been hiding somewhere | nearby, and then he followed us, He saw us pull the Hummer | into the storage facility, You saying Powers ran him over? Why you protectin' him? Powers hoped in the Hummer and | chased him, all right? That's all we saw, - Tre, this is over, It's done, | - Man, this ain't done, This is gonna be with you | for the rest of your life, Tre! If you're my friend, man, | you'll just let this go, Can't do it, (horn) (students cheer) Let's go, fellas!
