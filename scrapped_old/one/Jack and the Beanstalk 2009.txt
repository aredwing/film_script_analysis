A thesaurus is not a kind of dinosaurs. See what I mean? Oh, okay. Where for all thus the establishment of the prefey and trading sale. What? - The Pawn shop? Will you stop with the pawn shop? There is no pawn shop, get over it. Great, just great. So hero. You're a hero? We don't get many of those stories anymore.

It was right there, I swear it. Tell me what it says. Its doing it. Its doing it. Jack begins climbing the magical beanstalk, thus begins his quest for Destiny's Harp... Alright Grayson. Come on, let's go. Up, up there? Well, yeah. I... I don't think so. I'm not good with high... and I'm not good with quest either. I have an old war quest injury. You know what, go up there, take plenty of pictures, send me a post card and give my love for the Harp. You know what, you're right. Why don't you stay down there and look out for the big bad wolf, okay. Wolf? Don't you just love climbing Jack? Got my helmet, got my rope. Ha ha. A beanstalk, this is just what I need. Hey Grayson. I could see our house from here. Oh, that's nice. Can I go downs there get some worm on the way. Jack, would you slow down a second, please... Hey. I can't hold on much longer.

I wanna see if there is any mention of breakfast. You know, like some bacon, fish brown, waffles maybe. Oh, here its come. Climbing the beanstalk probability cold and held many other hardships. Hardships? That's plural. Why cant it just be one hardships, its a bunch of hardships. Nothing in the book that says Grayson makes some a bangle of smears, a cup of coffee and everything's fine. How many hardships can it be? Hey fellas, remember me? Define irony. I'll get you for that, Maury. We've made it. Let go. I'm trying but my thumbs have the mind of their own. And I think that maybe stupid. OK, on three. Ready. One... three. What happened to two? Where are we? now, let me check. Okay, ah Jack and Grayson. Grayson? I'm in the book, I'm the literary character. he he. Jack and Grayson find themselves in the maze Kingdom of the evil giant. You see, I'm in the... with the evil... ooh, crud. There it is again. Come on Grayson, let's go. Come on Grayson. Let's go this way. Jack. Jaaack. Jack? Jack? NO- Excuse me. - Please all speak up. Excuse me. Raise your voice, he's probably deaf. Scream it out louder. Just scream it out. - EXCUSE ME. Is that Destiny's Harp? I cant believe you scream it out on the old man, you make him cry. What's the mat... kids. Sir, I'm sorry I didn't mean to yell. Its not that, its just you said that word. You know that word? Destiny's harp? Is that it? No no, this is just a cheap imitation. This is beautiful. Well it should be, he's a master craftsman. See, it made by the legendary stradaberries. No, that's not it. - But its says right here, Stradaberries. My name is Very Saddius. Oh, yeah. Well he's well-known to... I guess. How I love my Destiny... Yeah, I love my destiny too. I only wish I knew what my destiny was. One minute, I'm a goose. I was wondering around picking at worms, everything's great. Then I wake up and I've got this face, its hideous... No, its not that destiny. Destiny is my granddaughter. She was always a harp. She was a beautiful little girl, with the voice that good make the angles weep. She was the light of my heart... until the giant heard her singing... and wanted the songs for himself. Oh Giant its evil. He plunders everything he want. He took my Destiny... Sing for me... Sing. Never. She was use to sing for the brute. So he using the last of the stolen poison, he cast a spell and turn her into a Golden Harp. I tried to rescue her so many others but nobody can defeat the giant. That's why, I tried to make another harp to exchange for her. Ask him one question and he tells you a story, it was like a three half an hours long. Excuse me, ah how's the harp going? Okay. So, where is Des... ...the harp now. The giants has her in the castle, keeps it under a lock and a key. Come on, we headed to the castle. No, no. Don't you understand? The maze is fill with puzzles and problems. And the giants knows everybody whose in it. There are only two kind of people who attempt this. A hero or a lunatic. Don't worry, between the two of us, I think we got that covered. We bring her back. I promise. Come on Grayson... Come on Grayson. He's ordered me around, he's stup... pssttt... Destiny... GRAYSON...

If you wanna go back, I understand... No... Hey. What's in limit you change your mind? Tap a pages 51. Jack and his best friend Grayson. Never been a best-friend before. Okay, well... look likes the hard part's behind us. Hey... Oh crud. This doesn't look good. The giants thought he might sends a little welcoming party. Oh... a party? I was scared for a minute, but a party. We'll had some cakes, some ice cream, they'll make balloon animal. And maybe we'll sing karaoke and then go home. Not really the kind of party had in mind. I think I'll leave you and your new friends to get acquaintance. Oh, that's gotta be painful. Shut up, get him. Hey, that's a goose feather. Twister, uh... Daddy, you've come home. - What? What? - Err, nothing. Nothing at all. Wow, that was fantastic. I mean, you've save us. Wow, I mean that was wow. You with the hu... and the ha... and the hiaaa... wow... I'm Jack. - I'm Jillian. Who's the dorky? I'm a goose, why is that so hard for people? - This is Grayson. So, who were those guys anyway? That? That was Dobbytok. The Giant number one and his brute squad. You guys must have the giant pretty worried if he send them. The giant is worried about us? Hah, punk better be... Now he's gonna be mad. Look, we have to go in fast. These scariest bubble Meany will be back with a greater number and with something more than just pillows. Follow me. Wait, I got a bad feeling about this. Ah, sorry sister but, we're on a ultra top secret mission. Yeah, to get a Destiny's harp. - How did you know that? Entire Kingdoms knows, I can help you. Look, we appreciate your help and all lad, but we got this under control. I mean aside from her dazzling ability with bedroom furnishing, what could she really do for us? This is the magical kingdom of Taliot which you ever reach by climbing a magical beanstalk. The giant terrorizes this land for over 30 years, kidnap Destiny, the daughter of Very Saddius so he can trump his stone maze in return of earning his granddaughter which he turn her into the magical harp that he keeps lock away in a trump that can be only open by two keys, one of it Giant wear it under his neck and the second which hanging in the crystal cave. Oh and I've been notice the maze like the back in my hand and I have the scar in my right thumb. Wow. So? And a peanut butter jelly sandwiches. Peanut butter jelly tud... Peanut butter jelly tud... Okay. Come on. - Ouch... Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly... Peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat. Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly... Peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat. Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly... Peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat. OKAY! - He takes away my big musical number... She's amazing huh? I don't know if I used the term amazing, I bet might not be the first thing I... I mean look even on the book it wouldn't call her amazing. I mean look here... a-amazing. Oh... crud... May I have your attention please, thank you. The town counsel has unanimously decided this... a beanstalk... it look technically green-space. And maybe a treat to our security so we'll going to cop it down. Sir, my son is up there. If you cop it down, he'll be trap with no way home. Your son is up there? - Yes. Right here? - No, he's there. Oh madam, I'm so sorry. Thank you. Hopefully sorry for this, its unbelievably sacrifice you make on behalf of the town. You're a good woman. Heroic and brave. Bring in a lumberjack. Oh no, you cant do that. Please. - I just did. I said bring in a lumberjack. NO, you cant do that. No, I can do it. I have the order as a mayor, I would bring the city counsel. No please don't hug the thing, there's nothing to see... bring me a lumberjack. - No. Hold. Who goes there? Us. - Friend or foe? Friend. - Foe? No, friend. Go away. I mean it, beat it, scram, get lost. Is this the center of the maze? - No. Are you sure? - No. I get it, its opposite day right? No. Haha, I knew it. He said no. Which means "yes" right? - No. Is everything opposite? - Not as far as you know. This is not right Jack, come on. - No, Wait a second. We're looking for a Destiny's harp. - Never heard of it. Great, that's mean he knows all about it. - This is silly Jack, come on. We heard you needed a key to set it free. - Its pack a lies. Good, so we goes straight trough the maze. No. - Good. It's not on the other side of the maze. - Its not. Yes. - Wait, yes to its not or its not not on the other side? - Yes. - No. - Right. - I'm lost. - You just gotta think backwards. Or stupid. - Hey. You cant get there from here. - Oh perfect. So how do we do it? Well, don't keep to the left and you wont find an iron door which doesn't lead to the crystal cave. Fine, so we stay left and leads us trough an iron door that take us to the crystal cave where we find a key that set us free, right? Wrong. - Right. - Wrong. - Right. It's a piece of cake. Ah, its a piece a cake. It's easy, its a... wait a minute, you said piece of cake? Piece of cake. - Are there nasty things on the other side? - No, not at all. None... none... no. Oh crud... Well, you all seems to fail a test. So, go on. Find the golden key, enjoy. Thank you? - Bite me. Did you see what he.. he said don't. Its not up... So long... We have something bananas... Hey, we gotta go left. - Its not the way jack. This way. No no. he said don't go left and if he said don't go left, we go left because its opposite day. I'm sorry, how would you know? Beside maybe its the totally honest day or trick the idiot day. Look Jack, its dangerous in here and do you really wants to risk your life to a chicken? Hey. - Come on. No wait, wait. Here, let's see what the books says. The trio headed into the maze uncertain of what lay ahead. Oh, this is not time for cliffhanger. Oh, I really don't need that guy right now. Have a nice day. Not, haha. Okay, what's with the book? Its my story. You have a real story? - Well, yeah. It mean its record everything you do? Everyone you meet and what they doing stuff? Oh, follow me. I'm the cute girl, I'm a little Miss Perfect. I'll be your best friend, I'll save you from pillows. And make everyone puke. - What is your problem? I don't have a problem, I'm perfect, I'm Mr. Perfect. Here we go, as they travel the maze, Grayson was filled with envious thought and burning with jealousy. Even though he had eaten the most peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. First of all, I only had three. - Four. Alright, four the most but that what point of view that book taking. Look, if she's so wonderful, how come she doesn't have her own story? Why she has to be in us? Maybe she's the bloody sidekick. I'm the bloody sidekick. Maybe I'm the hero. Maybe she's the bad guy in disguise. - What? MAYBE SHE'S THE BAD... - Shh... I'm not the bad guy. See, that's what the bad guy always said and then they follow it up by going "I'm really not". I'M REALLY NOT... - See... She could be leading us into a trap. - What? I won't leave her. Okay, we get it Jack. You're not like your father and maybe that's the problem. You see, every hero has a tragic flaw that leads him to defeat. Hamlet was a flippy flop and Killy had the foot thing and... You trying so hard not to be your father that... your gonna fail. I'm not a failure. Come on Jillian. Let's go. I... I didn't... Wait... Over here... Did you hear that? What was that? Jack... It's nothing. Follow me. No, no... We supp... This way... Hey, wait up. What is this? JACK... JACK... Oh crud... - Let's get out of here. Come on, let's go back. We have you Jack, join us... No, not me... Jack, try to get out. Its all over us. The book. Throw me the book. What? - Throw me the book. If I rip the pages we could start over. Jack, you cant... - The book now... Jack, its the clues everything. - Throw it. Got it. Jack, over here... Jack... What'd you do? It will be dark soon, we should camp for the night. This way. Yeah, like I'm sure that way safe. What are you? - Lumberjacks. What you do? - Chop... What are you? - Lumberjacks. What you do? - Chop... What are you? - Lumberjacks. What you do? - Chop... Excuse me, hey fellas. Um, actually I don't chop. What? I always rather like trees there barky goodies there leafy fooliets. Rather in the middle of something here. - I never want to be a lumberjack anyway. I always wanted to do something different with my life. Oh what did you want to be? I wish want to be... - What? What? I wish want to be... - Say it man... A pet store owner. What? Yes, hug-able dogs, hamsters, little rabbits and the old witch in blue parrot. Would you get rid of him. - Get rid of him. We shall not be move... What is it now. We shall, we shall not be move... We shall... We shall not be move... That's it. The iron gate. Just like the opposite guy didn't say. Yeah, good job its in here... Its dark, come on... Hello? Hello, anybody here? Its a three inch door. Who build a three inch door? - Grayson, I cant see anything. - Owh, who turn off the lights? Hold on, I saw this once in a infirmary shop. Jillian, are you alright? Oh great, two keys. It would have to be two keys that can make an easy like have one key there and the sign that says "take this key". Well, let's see opposite guy said take the Golden Key. So, it's easy. No, its opposite guy so that's mean its opposite therefore we take the silver key cause he said the golden key and we could take that but I guess that's mean something else. You understand? - Not really. But Jillian said take the Golden Key right? Oh yeah, and Jillian's your friend. JACK! Let's get out of here. Oh these are the strong bars. Yeah, great friend-men-ship. Don't worry we'll never get out of here. Bee, five four thumbs... I smell the blood of an Englishman. The Giant. Well I, technically I'm not English or a man. I'm an frantic Roman and I think I maybe a quarter Italian on my mother's side. Grayson. - What? Like you never been scared and... What have we here. Ah, you might wanna rinse that off. - 14 karats. From me? I'm on a low fiber diet. I thought you are a guy. - I am a guy. Guys cant lay eggs. - We'll take agenda. Oh, this swan lays an Golden eggs, Dobbytok. I'm a goose, a goose... Get him. - Okay... Come here. Let him go... Did you really think you could beat me? Little nobody like you. Just who do you think you are? Boy... Now... what about you? Don't even think about it dog breath. Ah, he doesn't know. He doesn't know. He doesn't know. Know what? Jack, I tried to tell you. You brought him here, just like you promise. You set us up. I did, but I had a really good reason. I really did, just listen to me. Please, Jack. Night night. - Please, Jack. Jack... Get in here, Ducky. Lock the door. Wait... I did what you ask. We had a deal, you bring me Jack and I give you your father. And I am a Giant of my word. Dobbytok. - Got it. Yes boss. - Get the father. Oh yeah, father. Will do. Yes, I'll get the father. Hello. No father. Take him, the old fool escape months ago, found the escape route to the world below. He got away but we crush the other prisoner who help him. And guess what? Now, I have his daughter. No, no. Let go of me. - Take her away. We had a deal Giant, you lied. You lied to me. Get off me. Take her. - No, you lied. Your a liar. Get off me you big green idiot. We have to get rid the beanstalk from the terror over there do not come down here. Chop her out too... Chop... Chop... Chop... Chop... Chop... Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello? Is not used. Get off me... Get in there. Lock the door. Bye-bye... Jack, I... - Don't... but I really wanna explain. - Just shut up okay. Lay another egg. LAY ANOTHER EGG. Look, maybe it was a one time deal. We could try the "Lamaze" method. You know... encourage and support. ...encourage and support. JUST DO IT! Mm, believable. Good. Look, Jack... I really didn't mean for this to happen, if only you knew why. If the Giant's lucky, that's the lucky do. I'm not a lucky. Once upon a time. There was a girl name Jillian who wanted to be the greatest hero of all time. But her father was capture by The evil giant... I did whatever I had to save my father, I didn't care how I did it or who I hurt. Then now I see it, there just so much more being a hero than just what you do. Its who you are. Right. Wait... No, I rather to be anything in your story than a hero on my own. You've shouldn't done that, now my story wont be told. I failed. Jack, a hero only a failure if you end the story too soon. I wanna help you and Very Saddius. And I'll go down to the beanstalk in search of my father. What do you say jack? Okay, let's do it. - Okay. So, okay. We need try to find a way out of here. We need to find something to pick the lock, okay. - Okay. Unbelievable. - Did you find something? Its a family crest. Do you know it? Dad... Its mine, my family crest. The old fool escape months ago, found the escape route to the world below. He got away but I crush the other prisoner who help him. ...crush the other prisoner who help him. Jack...
