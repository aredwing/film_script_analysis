Here Rachel Angela McKnight. Born on 8 May 1996 15 years old. A few weeks ago I experienced a miracle. I heard an angelic voice for which I found myself in dire need. And the angel said to her. "Do not be afraid, Mary, "For God is watching goodness. "You got pregnant and gave birth to a son. "And his name is ..." Jesus. Then Mary said to the angel: "How is this possible, but if you do not know a man?" And the angel answered. "Visiting this will Sv. Duh "Power and High will overshadow. "Therefore, the holiest by you born "Son of God." The only voice which I heard was the song on the tape. Is it possible that we did it on? This wonderful blessing of the heavenly life. Voice which sang of this miraculous and spiritual words ... "Do not leave me waiting by the phone." They live. He has given me little one Jesus? Amen. Tell Rachel to come over. I understand. Do not leave me waiting by the phone. Doing inventories at the end of the world? For a long time I did not have. How much time? Months. -It is normal. In your years come and go. Sometimes ... After a while you do not, it means you're pregnant. I think that's it. I'm so relieved. I thought you'd be angry. A few months ago ... When I was in the basement, I found a blue tape and something happened ... I think I'm pregnant with God through this blue tape. Get in the car. I need the keys. Is everything all right? -Women's problems. I would really like to explain. No, it's my fault. I should not have charged the head of all those stories. No! Do not talk about it. As long as we do not know for sure. Ten minutes had passed. -Good. It's a miracle! The role of mother is a very responsible job. I did not have a choice. Mom said she was surprised every time. But I believe that the role of mother can not be met without a father. The truth is that the man on the tape did it. God's assistant tape. Let's start with a prayer, Rachel. Will you lead? Dear Heavenly Father, we are grateful to you for this opportunity Conversation at the last minute, in order to understand the mysterious ways ... We are grateful for the cassette and ... Phones. Please give us a good feeling and the spirit of understanding in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. -Amen. Rachel, I was told that wearing a baby. Is this true? I called Ben Brooksbyja. His son, Elijah Brooksby, has agreed to marry you. Rachel, whoever did this, obviously not suitable for the father of your child. Not really. Rachel, you have sinned. I'm not. Maybe I was listening to something they should not. And then ... Then I got pregnant. A few months ago I found a tape in the basement, recorded music, and I felt, how my spirit slipping from the fingertips to the head. It was also as with Mary, as in your sermon! I found Rachel and g. Willa, who are doing something. Rachel, get up, g. Will you sit down, please. G. Will, Rachel is pregnant with you? I do not. No, I'm not. Now we are not talking to you, Rachel, but with g. Will. It was not me. I have no choice. Tomorrow, g. Will you leave this family, Rachel, you're getting married to Elijahom Brooksbyjem. Mom, we did not do anything. To bed. Elijah Brooksby? Marrying Elijahom Brooksbyjem? I do not need to ask God, I know that's not right. The horse ... Your big toes, as large as houses in a row ... So goes the story ... Take it easy. Hallelujah. Mom, wake up! Mama! Stop it! Rachel! Rachel, stop! -Rachel, come back! Come on, open up. No, do not. Do not do this. Stop immediately, Rachel!
