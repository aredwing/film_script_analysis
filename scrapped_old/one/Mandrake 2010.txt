 

                        Hey, where's mine? Where is McCall? They should have landed 10 minutes ago. Well, I... What are you waiting for? Call him. McCall. Please hold for Mrs. Manning. Hey, where are you? How many assistants do you have? Not enough. Please tell me you landed. I'm on the tarmac now. Good. Change of plans. Don't come to base camp. We found better access three miles downriver from here. Lin's got Mr. Vargas' maps. Santiago's got the boats. He'll take care of whatever you need. That sounds too easy. You always this prepared? That's why I need more assistants. Help's on the way. Yeah, I'm a doctor. An anthropologist. He's an archaeologist. What's he saying? He thinks you're a terrorist. What was it, three tours? That's a lot of Middle East stamps. Hey, Shugie! Hey, what's the problem? Pardon me. These are my people. Vargas expedition, huh? You disrespect me again? Sorry. I apologize. My friend. Okay, come. Vamonos. We have a long journey. I hope you got A/C. Of course. Of course. Three kind. So our good boss, Mr. Vargas, he's sure going through a lot of trouble for a rusty old knife, no? It's not the dagger. It's the pedigree. The Quayin Dagger once belonged to Pedro Arias Alvarado, one of the most decorated conquistadors of all time. By "decorated" he means "ruthless. " Tomato, "tomato. " Harry fancies himself a modern-day conqueror, so he squanders millions combing the world for any vestige of Spanish imperialism. If it's so distasteful, why lower yourself for a paycheck? Hey, his money is as good as anybody's, no? Look out! Are they junta? No junta this far north. They're guerrillas. General Gomez' men. Don't worry. We're like brothers. He divorced my cousin last year. So who exactly is winning this little war of theirs? How American of you to believe someone actually wins in war. If they didn't, we'd all be British. Put it on. What's this? Little gift from Carla, so she can keep tabs on us. Looks like it came out of a cereal box. Yeah? What's wrong with it? It's called a hidden treasure for a reason. There's no maps. There's a million acres of uncharted land out there. Without that map, we'd wander around for 10 lifetimes and never see the same tree twice. Where does Harry get his intel? Harry never reveals his sources. But trust me, they're reliable. Hey, Lin, what's at the bottom of this Yamballi stele? It's calendrics. Or glyphs. Instructions of some kind. No, they're astrological symbols. The ones at the top, but these glyphs are non-sequential. All right. Should I be taking notes or what? What's a glyph? Tribal writing, like Egyptian hieroglyphics. That's how they passed down stories. Boring details like grain inventories, birthdays. Tribal customs or warnings. Yes. Ancient secrets, mysterious curses. Ooh! It's been well documented. He'd know if he bothered to read. What's that supposed to mean? Figure it out. It's on the quiz. Get down, get down, get down. What? Get down. I said get down. Get down. All right, let's go. Don't you think all the whistles and clenched fists might be a bit over the top? You want to go toe to toe with heavily armed guerrillas, you be my guest. Just watch out for the jaguars. And don't forget the one-armed monkeys. I thought you said we had a guaranteed perimeter for Gomez. We do. What's that? Tracks like that wouldn't survive a strong rain. You, come here! Where is Makai? Mmm-mmm. You tell him to pick up his mess. Where am I supposed to look? So, Doc, what kind of warning signs should we look out for? It's okay, Captain. You don't need to placate me. I look like the kind of guy who placates people? And it's Sergeant. It could be pretty much anything. Invocation of deities to ward off theft, keep explorers from trampling on their graves. Invocation. You mean like curses? Something like that. Would they have devised defenses? You mean like booby traps? Something like that. It's only in the movies. Nobody asked you. Whatever. Oh! Hey, check this out. No, thank you. No, no. I'm serious. Come here. When I pull my zipper down, I usually get lucky, but never like this. Wow! A real conquistador. Flesh and bone. This thing's got to be 500 years old. "Jungle of the dead. " That's what the Yamballi call it. Don't you mean "called it"? They're extinct, remember? Why "jungle of the dead"? Because it's cursed. Has been for centuries. A lot of Spanish explorers came to this part of the world. Not many left. The name stuck. Bastards! Thought the world was theirs to conquer. It was 500 years ago, man. Let it go, huh? Lin claims it's authentic. Sounds like you're getting close. Any reports of guerrilla movement in the area? Hold on. Latest intel has them 40 miles east. Why? Oh, nothing. Just a hunch. Let me know if you hear anything. Yes. Well, I don't care what he thinks. I paid for results. Look, if he can't do it, get the money back and find someone who can. Good news, Miss Manning, that's all I have time for. Happy to oblige. I uploaded a photo the team just sent through. It's on the server, and I think you'll find it very encouraging. I'm boarding now, so give me a minute. Good morning. Good morning. Excellent. Uh, Sergeant McCall is concerned about the guerrillas, but I assured him... No, I thought we bought a window. We did. 48 hours. But General Gomez doesn't exactly hand out receipts. Oh, whoa! There it is. There it is. You know, that brave man could very well be one of my ancestors. I think we're close. With any luck we'll be out of here in eight hours. There's no such thing as luck, Miss Manning. Only determination and perseverance. Guys! I think this is it. No, no, no. Hold on. No one said anything about robbing graves. The Yamballi connected everything to circadian rhythms, so all the tombs should face east. Circadian rhythms? Most tribal cultures base their customs off the patterns of Mother Nature. Moon, sun, planets. Look for the one that runs north-south. You just said they all face east. Not the one we're after. Hey, wait. Respect the dead or they make trouble for you. Relax, man. We're not digging up random graves. All right? I'll know it when I see it. Everybody just fan out. What killed them off, the Yamballi? The usual suspects. Germs, guns, steel. White people, basically. Yeah, next you'll be blaming global warming. I was going to add multinational corporations, but I know you're a stockholder. That's right, baby. The next time you reach for a life-saving drug, remember it's from a multinational. Hey, guys? North-south. This looks promising. These are ideograms. Glyphs. "One heart for all hearts. " Come on. Let's get this sucker off, huh? Shovel. Hold on, hold on. Let me read this first. Why? You still working on your dissertation? Come on, shovel! Just give me a second. You really think they're going to warn us if this thing is cursed? Come on, vamos! I don't know, what if she's right? You don't know what's in there. This isn't an anthropology expedition. It's about one thing and one thing only. And no one gets paid till we deliver. Help him out. On three. Back up, back up. Come on. Ready? One, two, three. Good, good, good. Oh. All right. Come on. Now push. Ready? Ready? Okay, that's good, that's good. Ah! Aces over kings. Hey, hey. Just keep it in your pants. Let me read this before you do anything stupid. Look, you don't have to justify your paycheck. Let's just get this thing and... Hey, this doesn't make sense. Why was a European conqueror formally buried by his archenemies? McCall, tell her. Let her take a look. "Chok. " That means to put or keep. "Muskob" is blade. But the next word is too worn down. I can't read it. Instructions? Possibly. Or a warning. Hey, no, no, no! Relax, relax. It's no big deal. Oh, God! What are you doing? That word right there means death. This is a warning. Yeah. Well, nobody's dead. Right? Lin, hold it up. Ahead of schedule. I'm impressed, Sergeant McCall. Well, you gave us the map. I almost feel guilty taking your money. My goodness. It's exquisite. If you say so. What's Lin think? Hang on. Lin. Carla. Did you see it? Is it the one? Definitely. The blade is a little older than I thought, but the handle's vintage 14th century. Wait, hold on. What is it? It's the... The stone on the hilt, it's not obsidian. It's... Oh... It's a ruby. A ruby? Are you sure? Yeah. It's gorgeous. It's got to be 30 carats. Maybe more. I've never seen a stone this big. Send me a picture. Okay, hold on. How much you think that's worth? More than you or I could ever spend. Lin, let me talk to McCall again. Yeah? Listen to me very carefully. I don't want anyone getting any crazy ideas or renegotiating their contracts. So, you take that dagger and you keep it safe. Do it now. Yes, ma'am. Hand it over. Boss's orders. Got it. Good. Now turn around, head straight back to camp. Do not stop for anything or anyone. I want that dagger in my... McCall. McCall, talk to me! What's happening? I don't know. Uh... Guys? Nobody move. Wrap it up. That way, let's go. We can't just leave. Yes, we can! Stay together! Hey! Hey! Santiago, find the release point! You, stay with her. Don't move! Cut him down! Cut him down! Santiago, come here, come here. Give me a hand! Give me a hand! Lin, Lin. Relax. Relax. Get Lin down! What? No! No! No! Santiago! Help me! Help! Get me down! Wait! Wait! Go. Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Vargas. We've got a slight problem. The expedition was attacked and we lost contact with them. Attacked? Attacked by whom? We're eliminating possibilities. Gomez swears his men are nowhere near our people. Okay, hold on. Have they found the dagger? Yes, I'm uploading an image now. All right. Where is the team now? Last check had them leaving the grave site. When the fighting broke out, we lost GPS tracking. There it is. They found it. They really found it. Yes. It's exquisite, isn't it? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What is that? Is that a ruby? Yes, sir. You forgot to mention that before. Wait. It isn't documented. I didn't know anything about it. Oh, my God! This changes everything. I'm sorry? How do you know for sure that the team was attacked? I mean, how can you be certain? Well, I heard gunfire... Whose gunfire? I assume it was enemy fire. I pay you for facts, not assumptions! They took it. They took it! I can feel it. I'm coming there! No, Harry, wait. Just give me a chance to get some information. You have had your chance. You tell him to turn this plane around right now! Psst! Santiago. Did you get it? Who was it? Where's Lin? Call Carla, tell her to get us out of here. You just left him, didn't you? Call her. Go back, cut him down. I'll find Felicia. Don't move till I get back. What about the dagger? What about it? We don't get paid till we deliver. Maybe I should hold it, in case you don't make it back. I'll make it back. What are you doing? I'm getting us out of here. Give me the phone! You're never gonna find her! She's probably dead already. Give me the phone! They knew what they signed up for! We're all expendable. You stupid... No one goes anywhere till we get our people back. You hear me? Well, I'm not going back alone. So you choose. Lin or the girl. Hello? McCall? Felicia! Oh, man, this really blows. Who's there? Who's there? Stay away! Don't come any closer! I'm armed! Lock their last position and run a simulation to track their movements based on time and terrain. Where's my extraction team? I could send my guys, but then we'll be unprotected. What about the locals? They're spooked. One of the workers is missing. Now they're convinced something's out there. I'll pay double, triple. You just get me some real men. The locals have legends about them. That's why they stay away. Who is "them"? The beasts. They're ruthless. Shaped like men but warped like animals. It's got a heartbeat, I can kill it. And their claws, they cut through the trees. And they talk with the jungle. I don't speak jungle. It doesn't translate exactly, but... "Dark ones who speak with trees. " Yeah? Well, I don't believe in fairy tales, dude. What is that? You see anything? McCall? McCall! McCall! What happened? It grabbed me. The tree, one of its branches. The tree grabbed you. I'm telling you. It grabbed my arm! Get off me! Felicia, are you injured? No. Let me see. What was that thing? Let me see. We got to get out of here. Please. It's here. Who are they? Yamballi. I thought they were supposed to be dead. They are. There's something else out there. Something worse. Come on, we got to save Lin. Come on, you can't do this. I'm American! Just put me down, now! Let me go now! Please! Please, come on. I'll give you cigarettes. I'm telling you. There's something out there that even the Yamballi are afraid of. It chased me and grabbed one of them and dragged him away like a rag doll. What did it look like? It's gonna sound crazy, but it was this swarm of vines and roots, like the jungle itself was alive. The legend. I told you. They're not creatures. They're men in suits. Flesh and blood. Not them. It's the jungle. It's like it's everywhere, nowhere. One of the trees grabbed me, too. Look at this. Those markings on the tomb. Those weren't calendrics. It's a warning. What's it say? "The jungle feeds on the blood of the invaders. " Mr. Vargas, welcome. We got your tent all set up. Have you located them? We've narrowed down their location and are prepping a team for extraction. I brought my own men. Just show me where they are. I really think you should let my men do this. Well, that dagger is mine, and I'm not gonna let some soldier of fortune steal my birthright. We don't know that's what happened. Sergeant McCall comes highly recommended. And I've seen better men give up far more for far less. Harry, it's too dangerous. We don't know what's out there. Just give us some time. Carla, where are they? Last position's six kilometers due east. Quadrant 64-N. Thank you. Wait! Take this. Hey, hey! Look, I don't... I don't mean you any harm. Please just... Just let me go and I promise I will never come back, ever. Ever! Water. What'd they do to you? What'd they do to you? Water. I don't have any water. Did you come here to rescue me? Rescue you? No, I'm a... I'm an archaeologist. I was sent here on an expedition. By Harry Vargas? Yeah. Did you find it? The dagger? Who the hell are you? Dr. Emma Kirpatrick. Two weeks ago, Harry sent us here to find his priceless family heirloom. Wait, wait, wait. "Us"? Are there more? Where are they? Dead. I don't see him. Wait here. Do you think he's dead? There's no blood, the rope's been cut. My guess is they took him. We can't just leave him out here. Base camp. Carla's got all our watches locked into her GPS network. Mr. Vargas, you should rest. I'll rest when I'm dead. There. They came through here. You hear that? Hear what? The silence. No birds, no crickets. Nothing. The air, it's so thick. You can taste it in your mouth. No. No, please. Please, no. What are you doing? Hey, let her go. Hey! Leave her alone. Damn you! Please. What are they doing? What? Please let me go. No! Please. What's he doing? What's he doing? Hey, you leave her alone. Leave her alone! Hey. Hey, where you going? No. Where are you going? Come back here. Hey, hey. You get her down. Please! No. Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Help her. Help her! Hey, help her! Help her! What is it? There. Natives. What did this? Shh! They know we're here. Charlie! Nick. Nick! Hang on, Nick! Hang on! Harry, get over here. Harry! Hang on, buddy. You're gonna be fine. Give me your shirt. We need to put some pressure on this. He's not gonna make it. Yes, he is! We just need to stop the bleeding. Told you he's not gonna make it. Don't. Don't let your emotions cloud your judgment. You're a soldier. Act like it. I just don't see how the Yamballi could survive without anyone knowing. They're not exactly letting people go home to talk about it. You blame them? It's their territory. We come in, disturb their peace, trample their graves. What is it? This isn't Lin's. Whose is it? Harry, where are you? We've just been attacked. What? Are you all right? Prepare the camp for immediate evacuation. No, this is crazy. I'm sending in a team. We're pulling you out. Go, now. No, don't worry about me. It's my job to worry. Who attacked you? Don't worry about me. Harry, who attacked you? Talk to me. Harry. You ever notice the air out here? Harry. Is that blood on your face? It's invigorating. Harry. Harry! You heard him. Break it down. All of it. Alert the choppers. We need an airlift within the hour. Let's go! Get up! Look out! Boats are trashed. How are we gonna get out of here? Let's worry about that after we get our people back. Well, it's at least a week by foot. Why would anybody do this? Santiago was right. We invaded their territory, robbed their grave. It's more than that. I've spent years with indigenous tribes and I've never seen anything like this. Attacking in disguise, unprovoked. Merciless. It's got to have something to do with folklore. The creature. Oh, come on! We've been over that. You didn't see it. We did. You were under attack. Your stress level was off the charts, okay? Battle alters perceptions, especially if you're not used to it. Trust me. I've been there. He's never gonna believe us. Not until he sees it with his own eyes. I'm telling you, and I know what I saw. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter who's out there. It doesn't matter what I believe. We're stuck. So you want to survive? We have to focus. Work together. Okay? Let's do it. Let me go! Put me down! Put me down! No! Let me go. No! Hello? Hello? Does anyone hear me? Does anyone even know we're out here? I got it. I need batteries or a portable power supply. How does it work? The watches Carla gave us. They're all connected to a master GPS network. If I can get juice in this, we can locate anyone wearing one. Guys, look at this. Looks like Harry's been here. How do you know? Passport, laptop. Great, he's probably dead, too. Oh, no. No. No, no, no, no, no. What? Matt Baker, linguist. Dayton Riley, military specialist. Dr. Emma Kirpatrick? Archaeologist. There was another expedition team. That explains the bloody T-shirt, and the boot print in the mud. Why didn't they tell us? Because they're probably all dead. Lin. Lin. What happened? Are you all right? Not really, no. No. I thought the Yamballi didn't exist. Why didn't you tell me about the other team? What? Emma Kirpatrick, anthropologist. She was here. I watched her die. What are you talking about? Don't lie to me! Just don't! Those are her hands over there! You're sick. You sent us all in here to die. Lin, please. Please listen to me. Okay? I swear. I didn't know anything about this. You have to believe me. I'm here just like you. Please. Well, then Harry screwed us all. This is it. This is where they found it. "A great man lies here with no limits but the sky. " It's a funny thing, coming face to face with your ancestors. Yours is the glory. Mr. Vargas, this is a needle in a haystack. We're never gonna find them like this. That dagger belongs to me. I will find them. Where did you go, huh? There's fighting here. And death. McCall went that way. Why is there such a struggle over here? Take a guess, Nostradamus. Sergeant McCall is smart enough not to wave his exit like a flag. Listen. The jungle is trying to tell us something. It's angry. That makes two of us. Can you feel that? Huh? Feel that? Feel what? Help! Help! Help! Harry! Harry! Harry, help me! I should have seen it. It was too easy and for too much money. Vargas preys on weakness. He set us all up. We don't know that. Those people could be sipping margaritas in Cabo right now for all we know. You believe that? Harry's an opportunist. He's not heartless. His donations have kept my foundation going for the last two years. So why are you defending him? I'm not. I just can't believe he's that duplicitous. Or we're that gullible. It's like you said. He's a conquistador. He'll do anything for his treasure. Well, he's not moving, but that's Lin. Cut me a piece. Look, there's two more. One's moving due east by the graves. If Harry's here, maybe that's him out there looking for us. If Harry's here, he's only looking for one thing. Here. In case I don't come back. What? Where you going? To find Lin and see who else is out there. I suggest you two start to work on that two-way radio. No, I'm going with you. I can't ask you to do that. That's too dangerous. I'm not going anywhere. Our best chance of getting rescued is staying right here. This mission isn't over until we're all home, including Lin. Truthfully, I suggest we all stay together, but that's up to you. What if you were out there? What would you want us to do? Lin. Lin, talk to me. They're gonna kill me now. Don't say that. Someone's gonna find us. Listen! In a minute somebody's gonna come over here and untie me. And when he does, I'm gonna shove him on top of you. No, no, no. Don't make them angry. They keep knives strapped to their legs. Okay? You just try and grab it. I can't. Yes, you can. You just grab the knife. No, no, no. Just grab it, you grab it. Wait, Lin. Lin, wait. Wait. Carla, did you get it? I got it! Just let me go, please. Please don't do this. Just let me go. Damn it! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hey. Wait. Wait! Don't go! Wait. Just... Just stay here. Wait. Don't go! Just stay here. Wait. Carla! Get out here, you sick bastards! Help him! No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No. Please. Please, just let me go. Please. Please, please. I know you understand me! You know this is wrong. It's okay. Please. Please, just let me go. Let me go. Please. Okay? It's okay. It's okay. This is crazy. I feel like every branch is gonna jump out and grab me. What if it's not the jungle that's cursed? What if it's that dagger? Everything was calm till we took that thing out of the tomb. Why would the Yamballi care about the weapon of a conquistador? You tell me. Hey, Santiago, let me see that dagger. It's definitely Spanish in origin. At least the hilt is. Huh. What? So this isn't the original blade. The handle came from Spain, but the blade is from somewhere else. Is that writing? Looks like there's something here underneath the hilt. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What? What are you doing? I'm trying to see if there is something written under there. Okay, I agreed to help find Lin. Fine. But we're not gonna destroy this knife. Okay? It's our ticket out of here. Hey, wait a second. Someone's moving. Fast. It's alive, the jungle. It's a living, breathing entity. Just like you and me. You knew. You knew all along. Sick son of a bitch. Quiet, quiet, quiet. No! You're disturbing it. Let go! Quiet! Get off of me, get off of me! Carla! Carla, listen to me. Calm down. No! No, no. I don't know you. Quiet. Vargas, hands up. I said hands up. Why so testy, Sergeant? We're all on the same team. Your weapon. Pull it out slowly, throw it away. You know, I was hoping to meet your daughter one day. And inspire her with tales of your heroics. What's happening out here? If I knew that, I wouldn't need you. Or the other team? They all died, didn't they? An unfortunate necessity. You bastard. You sent us out here knowing full well this was a suicide mission. I didn't know. I swear. I didn't know about the other team. I never would have... Doesn't matter. There is a monster out there. And we're standing around arguing. Well said. We're wasting time. Give me my dagger. Sat phone, hand it over. No. The dagger first. Then the phone. How about I just shoot you and take it from your dead hand? Get on with it, then. Shoot me! Get back, get back. Get back. Help! Help! Let's go. Let's go. Go, go! Come on! Come on, come on. Come on, come on! No, wait, I can't, I can't! Get up. Is that the thing you saw before? Kind of. Only 10 times bigger. Well, let's see if we can make it dead. Harry pushed her. He pushed her into that thing. To save his own ass. You believe us now? Huh? I don't know what to believe. How do the Yamballi survive out here with that thing running around? Maybe they don't just talk to the jungle. Maybe they control it. We gotta go back and get Harry's sat phone. It's the only way out of here. McCall. What? McCall, look out! What? Get it off, get it off! Keep running! Keep running! Let's go! You stupid bastard. Since when are you the hero type? I need to stop the bleeding. Give me a belt or something. Douse it in fresh water. I always thought the doctor title for anthropologist was BS. You work in enough third-world war-torn countries, you learn how to dress a wound. Santiago, I'm gonna tie this really tight. It's gonna hurt, okay? Bite. One, two, three. I didn't know you had a daughter. A couple of years ago, an ex-girlfriend showed up on my doorstep with a three-year-old girl. She said, "I'm glad you're alive. Now it's your turn. " She has your eyes. What's her name? Amber Renee Stardust McCall. Wow, that's some name. Well, I wasn't there when they filled out the birth certificate. Her mom's kind of... Unique? I was gonna say psycho. But yeah, unique's about right. What are you doing? Can't keep running from that thing. Whatever it is, we've got to kill it. With what? How do you kill a tree? You chop it down. Or you burn it. But this isn't just a tree. It's sentient. It thinks like we do. Well, good. Then it'll feel pain like we do. This thing's gonna get infected out here. There's a medical kit at camp. If we get back, can you slow that down? Yeah. Can you walk? Help me up. I just don't see how a giant killer plant could wreak havoc like this without anyone knowing about it. Who knows? Maybe he was on a sick leaf. Carnivorous plants are rare, but nothing new. I've seen a Nepenthes rajah specimen over three feet tall. It kills frogs, birds and even rats. This thing was a lot bigger than three feet. True. But the rainforest is constantly evolving. Half the species out here haven't even been classified yet. Well, someone should have mentioned that in the briefing. Stay here. McCall, what's out there? See anything? Nothing. McCall. Santiago, light your torch. Light it, light it! Give it to me! Give it to me! Oh, my God. Get it off me. Burn it! Burn it! Get it off me! Burn it! Burn it! Get it off me! Hold on! Burn it! Again. You're okay. You're okay. What do we do now? What if it comes back? Quiet. Quiet, quiet, quiet. What if it comes back? Listen. What is that? Hey, where did they come from? Don't move. Hey, you all right? Everything is blurry. Oh, no. What? Lin's watch. I don't think I can do this. Yes, you can. Hey, look at me. I'm gonna see my daughter again. And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you back to saving the world. But you gotta stay sharp, you understand me? No more doom and gloom. Okay? Okay. Hey! Leave him alone! They understood you. It's Quiche. A Mayan dialect. Maybe it's close to their language. What's he saying? "Took the blade, awoke the protector. " They call that thing a protector? The warning is at the tomb. So it's our fault? I thought they controlled it. In the past, invaders attacked their land. Tribal elders prayed. Summoned a protector. He fed on the blood of the invader. But he didn't stop. He attacked them. So they created a... A talisman. Part Yamballi. Part invader. To stop the beast. Talisman. The dagger. We're supposed to fight that thing with a knife? No. He's pinned it to the earth at the sacred place. The tomb. What is that? What is that? It's inside me. Get it out! Get it out of me! A heart for a heart. I don't know. Maybe he said, "If the protector dies, we can save Santiago. " We have to kill it. That sounds like a really good plan. I'll do it. Give it to me. The knife. Give it to me. Heart for a heart. I'll do it. Tell him! Please, get it out of me. What is that? Is that beating? What are they saying? Something about heart of the invader. Stand back. What's happening? I think we pissed it off. Maybe we should take it out. Now. Run! Run! Run! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! I don't understand. It should have worked. We're missing something. Let me see it. There's something written under here. If I can just get this thing apart. Here. Come on! Let me see it. What does it say? "One heart "for all hearts. " That's what the shaman said what it said on the tomb. No, he said, "A heart for a heart. " He wasn't talking about saving Santiago. He wanted to sacrifice him. And I volunteered. That's why the conquistador is in the Yamballi grave. They killed him to imprison the creature. Human sacrifice. Give me that. I gotta lead them away. Get them off our scent. Don't leave. Stay here. Don't move, I'll be back. That sucks. Crap! This has got to end. I'm sorry. No. Don't! I'm sorry. I tried. Let her go. I'll kill him. I'll do it. It won't work. This sacrifice has to be an outsider. That's what they kept saying. You want me? Do it! Do it! Hand it over, McCall. Harry, you don't know... Give me my dagger! Don't do anything stupid, Harry. Harry! Harry, the creature and the dagger are connected. Be quiet! Oh, you son of a bitch! No. That dagger is rightfully mine. Get away from it. Don't tell me what to do. I don't work for you anymore. Time to die, Sergeant. You first. Is it over? Tell me it's over. It's over.
