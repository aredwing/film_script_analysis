 

                        Two years earlier LlGE, BELGlUM Dear Dad: Like father, like son, they say. This is crap. Jeez, what's he doing there? Dear Dad.. . On this day when.. . Belgium's French community is celebrating your work, l'm proud to be your son. Not bad. Come on! How are you, Dad? What is it? ls this your speech? l can't read it. A Tupolev 144? lt's crashing into a cat. You forgot the flaps on the cockpit. Can you read it, Jules? For.. . For 31 years.. . Do me a favour? Copy it out for me. Hi, darling. Will you take this to 4? You have to close up! Mike will handle it. For the refugees on Rue de Boissy. l'll change. You grab your newjacket. Bloody buildings! You ok, Dad? Last one. There. Easy does it. ''With their love, l'll follow my part.. . ''l mean, MY path ''with great humility. And, as the proverb says.. . ''The cellar is empty, but not the tree. My desire to work is still strong." Dad knows many Congolese proverbs. l remember one he told me when l was knee-high. A father always passes his nose on to his son. Which means, we see eye to eye. So, that's it. ''Thank you everyone. With great affection, Herv." Dear Dad, l'd like to take this opportunity.. . Yes, come up Mr Mayor, honoured guests.. . What can l say? Bravo, Dad. What flag is it? French? l don't know. Dutch! l don't see it. -At the back. Red, white, blue. Holland. Up there. Right. Hard! No, follow through. Don't listen to him. Do as l say. Harder! Give it all you've got. Harder! Look, l told you, either you call them or l do. On the court, l think it's me, alright? Come on, kill it! lt's not too bad. Will Grandpa play tennis again? No, he'll never play tennis again. Of course you fell. The key thing in tennis is tying your laces properly. Ok, let's go. Mr Collignon bought a losing operation. l modernised, and we're now Belgium's largest roadsign manufacturer. Excuse me a minute. lsn't Mr Collignon here? He's busy right now. But if you have questions about our 3 Lige plants, fire away. This is my lab. Our research is in mechanics, electronics.. . We test all the new products here. You're some kind of do-it-all. l'm some kind of engineer. l have free rein in developing new contracts. What's this? -lt's not yet patented. People want pictures, notjust words. Well, come over here. What is it? A solar turtle. Good, Jules. lt's a solar-powered, robotic lawnmower. Go ahead, take a photo. lt's intriguing. But my husband mows the lawn for exercise. lt mows non-stop, unattended. Shall we go? Go ahead. l'll catch up. How are Alice and Jules? Well, thanks. Michel, l'm shutting down your lab. Four years of research, for what? For what? The de-icer is almost ready. De-icer? Germain, look beyond Belgium. We need to crack new markets. Patience, work.. . Money! l'm your employer, not your patron. You're number 1 when it comes to modernising facilities. But inventing isn't your cup of tea. -You mean yours. What about customers, markets? You've got 2 months to sell one of your inventions. Or? -You're back on the floor. lf not for your dad, who gave me African contracts, l'd have bailed long ago. That was centuries ago. Herv's doing just fine! lt's kind of you to ask. Stop by some evening. Stay off the green, Michel. That's cheap. Just like you. Guess who? Do you want to play now? A woman? A man? A shrimp? Spineless? Filthy rich? Germain Collignon? That's not how you play. Stop it. Sit down. l'm not hungry. Sorry, Jules. What's he like? Tall? Will my hair be like yours some day? Hair like yours? No, you have hair like your mother's. What do l have like you? l don't really know. All sorts of things. Big ears. And you're brilliant at drawing, like Dad. Yeah, brilliant like me. What's a ''bastard''? Who called you that? No one. Someone at school, the caf? Who? Who said that to you? Don't get upset. He's curious. Listen, Jules. You're not a bastard. l'm your dad and she's your mum. Look at my dad, at his nose. Do we have the same nose? Do we have the same mouth? No, but he's still my dad. ln your veins you have the same blood as me and as Grandpa, promise. Believe me, he's your dad. Eat up, sweetheart. Sorry. No Dad, not tonight. Tomorrow. Dad's agitated. l'm worried he'll have another stroke. He's energetic, not agitated. He needs help. He's writing another novel. He told me that. How, exactly? By belching, farting? Stop. He's the family elder. We do as he asks, ok? l was the elder until you brought him home. His place is with us. Who's going to look after him all day? Shit! You're at the caf, l'm at the plant. Jules, you and me. Who'll look after me? Who'll look after me? What? Come on, try. What happened, Dad? Did you fall? Are you ok? Did you hurt yourself? Michel? lt's ok, he's alright. What? Where should l put it? Want me to open it? ''Montral, April 8, 1960. Dear Francine, dear Herv, ''Unfortunately, l must return your letters. ''Baby Michel's parents.. . What is this? ''Baby Michel's parents didn't reply, and our mission forbids us to look for them." What is this? Dad! What is this? l'm adopted, is that it? Looks like a gun from Star Wars. lt's a de-icer for power lines. And the ATA form for your merchandise? lt's a prototype, not merchandise. l filled out the form, the E.. . E-672. But the form doesn't clear the merchandise, l do. Fine, but hurry. l'm late for a meeting with National Power. lt's not like clearing chocolate. Without the ATA, l have to hold it. No, l'm not selling it. lt's my calling card. As essential as your uniform. lt has to be cleared. Montreal Airport reminds you that security is everyone's concern. Don't move! The de-icer is placed on top of the pylon. The model doesn't show the proportions, but the weight is minimal. Just ask Canadian Customs. They have the original. The ultrasound transmitter relays a frequency to the line capable of eliminating frost and ice to -25, preventing the collapse of pylons and.. . other future disasters such as the one in 1998. Sorry. The system's lifetime is equivalent to that of the grid.. . l think we've understood. lt's going well. l don't know, we'll see. l don't know, l tell you! Michel! ln '58 l went on a religious mission to the Brussels World Fair. The African Pavilion. The Congo Pavilion. One day l saw a show about Congo. The power went out, causing quite a commotion. That's how l met your parents. We met again. We became friends, and your mother confided to me that she couldn't have children. l know, Herv told me. ln 1959, l phoned your parents in Belgium. l went and picked you up near St Ccile. You were born on a big farm. Your birth mother had been hidden in a barn. l was to meet your adoptive parents in a motel near Montral. Later, Herv wrote to me, but l couldn't contact your birth parents. l returned his letters. How would l go about finding my parents? There must be some register or file.. . Your adoption never took place, officially. l arranged at least 100 such adoptions, you know. Yours.. . Yours, l still remember. Because l hid you away at my brother's for one week. And you never cried. Your father's name was Legrand, l believe. Thank you. Nothing but Legros! Thanks. Lousy French fries! Legros Foods. Hello. Hello. My first church in Qubec. lt's no cathedral. But Tuesdays the Wolf Lake choir performs here. Then it livens up. Are there a lot of wolves around here? Wolves? No, none. Maybe a few raccoons. -But lots of Legros. Yes. Each village has its family. ln Ducros, it's Legris. ln Alcove, another family. Any Legrands? Legrands? l don't think so. Excuse me. Alice, Jules, it's Dad. l wanted to hear about the tournament. Where are you? Jeez, you're sleeping! Goodnight. Made in Belgium. lt's a turtle lawnmower. lt runs entirely on its own solar power. You won't need your tractor. l don't dislike mowing grass. Do people here generally like mowing grass? Basically? We don't talk about it. l see, grass is a taboo here. ''Michel.. . That's me. ''now rolls over on his own. He's very athletic and drinks a lot." l was born in St Ccile in a barn. And so? lt's like looking for your photo in a family album and not finding it. Understand? Not a bit. For a secret adoption, the church register's useless. We could announce it in the parish bulletin. Do you want to find them, yes or no? Basically? l'm wondering what the hell l'm doing here. National Power's Hybrid Car Stalled Here you go. l suggest you go to the junction down the road. Hitch a ride to Wakefield. There's a bus there. l washed my hands, l swear. Sorry, it's because of.. . What happened to you? Caught my arm in a school-bus door. Like to sign it? Where you headed? To Waukfield. You're not staying? My family's waiting for me. You give up easily. Mr Legros will take you. l have a First Communion class. Quite a man, once you get to know him. St Christopher. Patron saint of drivers. -Travellers. ls it a hybrid motor? Diesel-electric? Yeah. lt's not the original motor? No. ls it more or less hand-built? More than less. The Japanese will soon produce nothing else. Damn seat. The person who built the motor.. . Did he build others? -He's dead. You knew him? A bit. He was my father. Sorry. -No problem. So, were you born here? No, l was born at Expo 67. Where's that? The 1967 World Fair in Montral. No kidding. -Yeah, prematurely. On the site? -On the site. My mother was 8 months. lt was hot, she'd stood all day and.. . l was born at the Man in the Universe Pavilion. Was your dad with her? No, he was working in the Man at Work Pavilion. Man at work in the universe. Fabulous. Want help with that? No, it's ok. Shit! The great Canadian outdoors! Bad fries! Bad beer! l can't sleep! What a pain! l'm taking a piss! Can't l piss in peace? Excuse me, but what brings you to St Ccile? lt's not exactly Niagara Falls. l'm here in Qubec for my work. l invented a de-icer for power lines. l came to show it to National Power. National Power? You work for NP? No, not at all. You're not de-icing lines now, in summer. So? So, what? What are you doing in St Ccile? Looking for my family. You have family here? Yes. Well, no. l was born here. ln St Ccile? An ostrich! ls anyone home? Open up, please! Open up! ls anyone home? There was an accident! Open up! On February 3, 1960, Michel could already turn to the ventral position. He measures 1.21 meters. He ate well and with a single belch could melt up to 12 km of ice. When he grows up Michel wants to invent toasters, or else, and why not, be the king of Belgium. l was.. . The man in the.. . He's been hospitalised. Did you call it in? No, l was with him. You're hurt. The other man, is he still alive? He wasn't moving. He's at Sacr Coeur. l'll drive you. He's in a coma. The surgical decompression didn't work. He won't wake up. His head is like a frog's. You always say that. Where's it from, Rob? We followed your map to the river. After we blasted, we found that. lt's the first one l found. A present. So you stay in touch with us lndians. The Minister of Energy? Or of Natural Resources? No, the Energy Minister. He wants to see me and Rob? No, just you. About your father. What did l say about Agassi? He creamed Roddick 6-4, 6-1, 6-4. No, 6-1, 6-4, 6-1. Yeah. Ok, bye. Ok, good. Everything ok? Louis Legros! -Mr Minister. Glad you came. You're going abroad? Tomorrow morning. Sorry to call you in. Green tea, organic juice? Fair-trade coffee? Let me explain. To mark 2000 we want to revive NP's electric car project. Really? You have the wrong Legros. Right. Any news from your dad? Not in 2 years. He disappeared with his car. We never saw him again. He may be dead. Sorry, l didn't realise.. . Did he work on the project after leaving NP? No idea. l do know he accused everyone there of sabotage. What do you mean? He thought that oil lobbyists had bought off NP's bosses. lt wasn't like that. The technology wasn't ready. Dollars and cents. Now Dad's technology is spontaneously ready? The timing is better. So you want to revive it? Frankly, l don't see how l can help. Of course. R&D is complex, but that's fine. Where is his research? l don't know. You realise it's National Power's intellectual property. Let's not nitpick. When do you go? To Belgium, is it? ''With a sky so sad that a boat committed suicide." Know it? No. Come on, Jacques Brel. That's not quite it. Mr Legros? l'm Madeleine Longsdale. l worked with your dad. Could l have a word? Your dad built electric motors. The challenge was the battery. He almost solved the problem. His revolutionary battery was better than today's fuel-cells. So why did NP turn off the tap? There was a lot of pressure to do so 8 years ago. Things changed. GM, Honda.. . Now they all want to build hybrid cars. The government wants to force NP to sell the plans overseas. So they don't need Dad. He took the plans with him. lt's been hushed up, but NP will want to defend itself. Either by accusing your dad of theft or ruining his reputation. He did that himself, with his paranoid biblical rants. l'm an engineer. l've seen your dad's results. Sylvio had his faults, but his paranoia wasn't unfounded. Find his work. Show it to journalists, the universities, but not politicians. Save his legacy. National Power's Hybrid Car Project Stalled Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard Flight 931 to Brussels. We will be in the air 6 hrs. 15 min. at an altitude of 10,000 metres. Or maybe 75,000. Anyway, no one gives a damn. Passenger Louis Legros is requested to save his dad's legacy. Sir, please sit down. We're about to take off. l have to get off. Are you sick? Yes, l must get off. Fine, but sit down. l'll come back. l want to leave! We're taking off. You must.. . You can't. l'm getting off. Look.. . -lt's important! Please call someone. Stop the plane. Please, sir. -And l'm not crazy. Fine, but you must sit down. Otherwise, l can't help you. lt won't be long. Stay calm. l'm thirsty. Don't move! l'm not thirsty! Where did you get malaria? ln Africa. Where in Africa? Congo. Diamonds, a lost father, a revolutionary invention.. . lt's all so unlikely, l have to believe it. You scared me! Let's see. Sneaking up behind me. Nothing. Got a fever? lsn't that over? lt's never over, Mum. lt's ok, l'm used to it. Does your arm hurt? -No. l should've told you to go. Come on, cut it out. You'd look for Dad's papers? Couldn't it wait? You don't get it, there's stuff going down. ln 24 hours l've met a Minister, a lady out of James Bond, and been tackled at the airport, and NP has attacked Dad in the papers. l'm going over. Now? lt's about time. We hadn't spoken in years. Give me the bus keys. No way! The batteries still work. He ordered it from the States. Nifty, isn't it? lt's amazing. One room that doesn't reek of motors. Come on, let's go. We just got here! What are you looking for? l don't know: plans, sketches.. . You won't find anything. Really? Why do you say that? Know what l think? The plans never existed. Sylvio was fired for incompetence. So? Those plans were his life. His colleague said he was just about to.. . ''Just about. lt's coming. On the verge.. ." Same old story. His colleague fell for it. She's an engineer. She saw Dad's plans. He designed an electric wheelbarrow. lmpressive to an 8-year-old. But get real! You do what you have to. Stay and help! -l'll pick you up later. Don't bother! Ladies and gents, my father was a visionary, recipient of the Grand Vase of St Ccile. Sorry. Legros Electric Cars. To invest, leave a message. Mr Legros? lt's Father Gagnon. Mr Legros? Mr Legros? lt's Ducros Lumber. Could you pick up your car? This isn't a long-term parking lot. lt was two summers ago. l called, asked him to come get it. Why did he leave it here? lt stalled out front and he left it in the driveway. Asked me to watch it while he got gas. But he never came back. How was he? Nervous, acting strange? Did he seem worried? He was.. . polite. Polite? Polite? Yeah, polite. He was polite. lt's like you say. l didn't say anything. l'm asking you. -Cheerful? My dad was cheerful? You don't know him. Not at all. lt's hot. ''Sylvio Legros: lnventor or dreamer?'' No way! Gotta wait. For what? Until it recharges. l guess. Father Gagnon died almost two years ago. l never met him. Too bad. He wanted to see my dad. Sylvio Legros. Ring a bell? You're the son of Lucie and Sylvio Legros? Yeah. Holy Father, the Vatican The presbytery was sold. l have to empty it. What do l do with it? -l don't believe it! A triporter! For the Vatican. John Paul ll needs one! The parish is bankrupt and we can't send it there. Don't send it to the Vatican! Dad was a little bit of a.. . -Jesus freak? ''Most Holy Father, ''l'm honoured to give you the SL-1000. ''Where l sought progress, l met disappointment. ''l ask St Christopher's protection on one more trip. Please accept my warmest prayers, Your Holiness, Sylvio Legros." Poor Dad. Sounds like a will. l tried talking to your mother. She must have given you.. . Shit? Something like that. She's at war with all black robes. l wasn't wearing mine. You can't blame her. She got pregnant by my father in '59. They weren't married. She was young, only 14. Her parents hid her, and a nun took the baby. So for her the Catholic Church.. . lt all happened in the red barn at Farm Point. She never forgave her parents, or the Church. Or my father. How are you? Hello.. . -Lucie. Lucie. Any suggestions? The shepherd's pie. A local dish? l've heard it's from Vermont. lt's mashed potatoes, ground beef.. . Oh, cottage pie? Yeah, but with corn. Shepherd's pie, is it? Yes, l'll try it with.. . a coffee. Would you know of anyone going to Montral? l don't but l'll check. l do know we have soap. l tell my son that. lt's what parents do! A coffee for 5. A nice Frenchman wants a lift to Montral. No, Mum. With you it's priests, with me, tourists. Don't say, Just like Sylvio. One shepherd's pie. Here. -Thanks. Did he ever come here? Look what l found in his car. And? What are you getting at? What are you hiding? Dammit! You have a brilliant career. Your research is promising. And your Belgian trip? l didn't go. l never looked for him when he disappeared. Know why? -Why? You were glad he'd gone. No more late calls or sermons. Great! He wasn't dead, just gone. Jesus Christ! Sorry. Are you ok? l'm fine. St Christopher. ln the Middle Ages people thought his image.. . Prevented accidents? -Yup. Sweet. No damage. Good. -Good. Can you take him to Wakefield? Going to Waukfield? Wakefield. No, to Montral. That's even better. Listen. Vigneault. lt's Gilles Vigneault. Know it? Vigneault, yes, but not that cut. Cut? Song. You know it well. Yes.. . l saw him in concert in Brussels in '79. Brussels? Are you Belgian? -Exactly. l'm going to Antwerp. Antwerp? Lucky you! Super. That's super. With the German accent and all, the Flemish'll love it. German? So? People don't like it. What takes you to Antwerp? l developed a new way to grade diamonds. You don't say! lf a buyer knows a diamond comes from Qubec rather than, say, Congo, which sells dirty diamonds to finance its war, it might be useful to him. May l? -Yes. My wife Alice had a tobacco pouch full of diamonds when l met her. She was fleeing Congo, l was in Brazzaville. Her dad had a store in Kinshasa. Rebels were forcing him to launder diamonds in order to buy guns. When the army started breathing down his neck, he gave his stock to Alice, told her to flee. He was murdered that night. She opened her caf in Lige with dirty diamonds. St Christopher. The patron saint of drivers. -Travellers. Want help with that? No, it's ok. ''Accumulator and batteries." No way, no way! l'm taking a piss. ''Prototype motor." Hello. May l speak to Madeleine Longsdale? Louis. Legros. Did your dad build other types of electric motors? Excuse me, but what brings you to St Ccile? lt's not exactly Niagara Falls. ln St Ccile. What are you doing in St Ccile? Looking for my family. You have family here? No. l was born here. ln St Ccile? An ostrich! Two years later Two years later Madeleine Longsdale. -What? No, nothing. lt was demolished, notebooks and all. l understand your frustration. lt's very touching, Mrs.. . Longsdale. But after we last spoke l spent 6 months in a coma. Yes. What's our fax number? 21st Century Car: Made in Belgium Michel Roy: lt's my whole life's work. We could always file a patent circumvention. We'd modify some elements enough to legally circumvent the patent. As l've been saying, we haven't protected the technology yet. There's a patent problem? ln Connecticut they produced a motor like yours. Really? Something that resembles our patents. lt's similar to the Collignon model. The what model? Collignon? What should we call it, Michel Roy? The Royale? The Germaine, Germain? ln St Christopher in Connecticut is a company, Forward Electric, making things like barn door openers. No cars, of course. But it seems they have a patent like ours. And that's a problem. We must document your work to protect it. ln case you're asked what inspired you, what made you put the motor in the wheels, you see? lt simplifies production. Stop it, Michel. Where were you? Eating what? lt's the context l need. ln high school. ln high school? Let's be pragmatic, work as a team. A team! Let me quote you: ''With our pals at Fiat we're forming an A-1 team." Where do l fit in? lt's called PR. l let you handle product. While Danielle handles Connecticut, you clear up the patent mess. l don't give a damn if you invented it, but l need arguments, so work up a good story. The Congo Pavilion stood here. lt covered the entire area. lt's all trees. We can't launch his book in a forest. Use your imagination. At night, with candles.. . Lovely! What did l tell you? Look, it was on the other side. Like l said! ''On July 3, 1958, ''a blackout interrupted the Congorama show. ''ln the ensuing commotion, ''a Canadian nun escaped being trampled ''thanks to the aid of the journalist and his wife. ''A year later, the couple arranged to meet the nun in a motel in the Qubec countryside." ln 1958 Belgium held an enormous fair that lasted six months. The Brussels World Fair was inaugurated by King Beaudoin. Here we see the monarch attending the Congorama, a sound and light show that tells the story of the explorers who made the Belgian Congo into what will be a country of the future, if Whites and Blacks work hand in hand. ''Congorama was a show at the 1958 Brussels Fair depicting the benefits of civilization in Congo." Today it's the name of the CC-1000, a revolutionary car conceived in Belgium. Michel Roy, please tell us: why the name Congorama? My wife is Congolese. lt's to honour her courage and support. There's also a family reason. Your father, acclaimed writer Herv Roy, was born there. Yes and he fought for its independence. Amazing. A question we all have: What inspired your motor? Good question. l worked several years in Africa. Kids there have an ingenious toy that l'll show you. l never got the hang of it. You do it, Jules. My son Jules. He's more athletic than me. Show them. African kids play by propelling a wheel with a stick. That image has stayed with me: a self-propelling wheel. But the National Factory in Lige built a prototype in 1908. lt's about the batteries. 20 kilos of my batteries beat 200 kilos of conventional ones. Meaning electric cars with greater autonomy, and above all, zero emissions, non-polluting. A stroke of genius, Michel! Proof Belgium has.. . -More than just fries! Happy about your one-man show? ''Made in Belgium!'' The press is wild! lt's called PR. l even made the cover of ''Libre Match''! Congorama's a shitty name! While you clown around, our lawyer is negotiating the patent. Fiat's furious! They're bigger than you. l'd be proud if the car were Belgian. A proud Belgian! Sounds like a sermon by your dad. Have you heard Herv speak recently? Since he wears diapers? The man who opened up Africa to you? Did you know Dad wears diapers? lt's dark around the edges, like in a tunnel. lt's lodged here, behind the eye. lt's threatening the optic nerve. What is it? lt's definitely not organic. Are you exposed to stone or metal splinters at work? No. Glass, perhaps. Glass only shows up on a scan if it contains lead. We'll have to do further tests. l'm ordering an MRl. We're closing! Closing? We're having a guest for dinner. Jeez! A friend of yours. He saw you on TV. Who? l have no friends. We'll play Who Am l? Who is it? You know the rules. l can only answer yes or no. Who's coming tonight? Your Qubcois friend. Hi Michel. You're alive. Amazing! l'm glad. Really glad! lt's unbelievable. l never hoped.. . You're alive! Not here, my family.. . They told me you were in a coma, that you'd never come out. What could l do? l couldn'tjust wait. My family, Jules, my wife.. . everyone was waiting for me here. You're alive! You were in the accident. Sure, don't you remember? You're alive! l'm alive. lt's unbelievable! Look what my dad brought me from Qubec. When it strikes, the cock crows. Not now, put it away. This is real bad! No, it's delicious. For us, real bad means great. You'll have to write us a dictionary. So you're in the same field as Michel? lt's hard to say just what field Michel is in. So true! Alice.. . Sometimes it's TV, the factory. My dad's an inventor. Really? That's great. What does he invent? Stories? Does anybody ever invent? No, they recycle. They build on other people's ideas. You need a cane? No, it's alright. The crash. l wasn't as lucky as your dad. What crash? The car crash we had.. . He didn't tell you? Of course he didn't tell you. Michel, what happened in Canada? Nothing. l went to St Ccile, for the reasons you know. l met Louis, who offered me a lift to Montral. And the car hit a sort of ostrich. An emu, to be precise. The doctors told me you were finished. l didn't tell you about it, so you wouldn't worry for nothing. You nearly died and you didn't want us to worry? Exactly. -What else are you hiding? ls that all? What? Look at me! What? lt was a miracle, l was barely scratched. But l just had a scan. There's something behind my eye. lt's severing the optic nerve. l have to avoid any shock! What? -l have a diamond in my head! A diamond? -l'm going to lose my left eye! l'm going to lose my left eye. Why all these secrets? l won't have secrets here! Secrets can kill. Secrets killed my father, and now you.. . l'm not going to die. l'm talking about my eye! l'm your wife, they're your father and son. You've been lying since Canada! We all tell lies. -Meaning? Herv lied to me for 40 years! And you.. . What, me? What are you doing? l want my father's notebooks. ls that Dad's medal? The nerve, give it back! Give me the notebooks first. Fine. Tomorrow l'll give you what you want. Go to bed, Jules. What are you doing? Alice threw me out. Through here. The car of the future? We used an old body. The revolution is here. lnside. Your father's battery. Lige-Turin on a single charge. Want to go to Torino? The nerve! Lots of people could blow the whistle. lt's like you found a Van Gogh and said, Look what l painted! Are you a thief or plain dumb? Both. When will you denounce me? Go on, hit me! lt'll make me feel better. Fuck you! l should kill you, but given your talent for resurrection.. . lf only l hadn't gone to Canada! Hadn't been born in a barn in bloody St Ccile! Hold it. What did you say? Didn't you know? l'm a bastard born on a bed of manure. You were born in a barn? l should've stuck to my solar-powered lawnmowers! Alright. Let me be the one to tell my family, ok? That won't be necessary. You'll complete my father's work. Here. l'll get my stuff and go. You ok, Dad? l shouldn't have gone to Canada. lt wasn't a good idea. l screwed up over there, you've no idea. Not in your wildest novels. l'm not an inventor, l'm nothing. l'm not even your son. Do you want to become like.. . You know.. . Kim and Justine? -l'm not that good. Jules? Show me the back of your neck. That a birthmark? Yes. What's he up to? Here. Thanks. Belgians kiss only one cheek. How did your father die? Forgotten. Dad's name was Sylvio. Sylvio Legros. Hello. To the airport. When will you be back? l don't know. Grandpa gave me this for you.
