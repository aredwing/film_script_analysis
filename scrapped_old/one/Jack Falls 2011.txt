 

                        My name is Jack Adleth. At least that's what it says on the death certificate. I used to be an undercover police officer... which means I've done some terrible things... but enough is enough. It's time to walk away. Jack! Jack! Jack, stay with me. Jack! Jack! - Come on! - What happened? - Is he dead? - You took your fucking time! - Do you know CPR? - Yeah. Good. Start. This is, um... very serious, you know? - Can you save him? - Oh, well... Let's find out, shall we? He's lost a lot of blood. Most of it over you two by the looks of it. The thing is, I have no idea how long he hasn't been breathing for. If the brain is deprived of oxygen for more than four minutes, well, let's just say, even if he survives, there could be, um, complications. Just do what needs to be done. OK. I'm right on it. OK, and clear. Thank you. You know, these things never work first time. Take two, and clear. - No? OK. 360 it is, then. - What the fuck are you doing? Whoa, whoa! Come on, Jack. Jack, just fucking wake up! It's no good shouting at him, he can't hear you. Well, what do you know? We've got a pulse. Please, carry on. I can't wait to see what you're going to do next, doctor. You fucking help us! Well, you seem to be pretty good at this on your own. Oh-oh-oh-oh, please, please! Look, I will do what I can do, no questions asked, OK? I can clean up the wound and sew him up, but he's gonna need blood and a lot of it. - You can take mine. - My dear, it's... I'm O positive. Take as much as you need. Jack. Jack. I'm waiting for you. I miss you. You don't look too clever, mate... but you'll be all right. - Sid? - Rest. We'll talk soon. Get your strength back. You're gonna need it. Aargh. Ahh. Jack! Jack, be careful, don't move. - Natasha? - You OK? I'm just getting my bearings. How long? - Three days. - Fuck! But you're OK, thank God. Where are we? In Amsterdam still, other side of the city. Really getting around, aren't we? What about London? Carter's taken over. He didn't waste much time after... after Dad died. Don't you worry. A visit to Carter is on the top of my to-do list. I think maybe getting better should be at the top of your to-do list. I got shot, Natasha. It's oddly affected my priorities. Sorry. - Why do you think Carter did it? - Of course it's Carter. Who else would it be? Fuck's sake, did you stitch me up yourself? Well, good luck getting close to him. He's twice as powerful as Dad was, and he's ten times as vicious. He's eradicated all the competition, he's got a monopoly on just about everything. Prostitutes, gambling, drugs, guns, protection - he controls it all. No one can get near Carter. Not even the police can touch him. Yeah, well, it's a good job I'm not a policeman any more. You wanted to see me, boss? Here's that file for you. Just wanted to let you know that we've, er, had to let Jack go. You mean he's... out of the picture? Well, he's already terminated his own employment, so he won't be freelancing. Right. I'll let Edwards know, then. Dominic... to lose a man is worth it to keep the others in line, you do know that, don't you? Yeah. Course. He was a good U/C. He was, yes. He was one of our best. But I think karma had something to do with his demise. I just wonder sometimes if we let the end justify the means too much. Nobody cares about the means. That's why Jack did the job. Broke the rules - is that the official line? There is no official line. Tell me... who's the fucking wanker that was supposed to keep him under control? - I passed him over to Edwards. - You... was in charge! It all went tits up and I had to deal with it. End of. Boss. What colour is that word? Blue. Red. Very good. Are those lines parallel? Yes. Yes, yes, yes! What else do you want me to do for you? Do you want me to colour in for you? I haven't got crayons, but I'm sure I could get some. - These tests are necessary. - What for? You were dead for quite a while, and you'd lost enough blood to fill a bath before you stopped breathing. Lack of oxygen to the brain can cause ischemic hypoxia, though in your case, I think you're going to be all right. You seem fine. If anything was amiss, you'd have experienced it by now. Experienced what? Oh. Memory loss, speech difficulties, reduced motor functions, hallucinations, difficulty expressing emotions, paralysis. It depends what part of the brain is affected. Hallucinations? - Have you been hallucinating? - Of course not. How do you feel? Like shit, cos you did a piss-poorjob stitching me up. Aren't you supposed to have a nurse with you, that gives me a bed bath about now? You listen to me, buddy, your little girl is paying me to treat you, not humour you. So, ifyou want fresh flowers and room service, I suggest you go back to London, and let our precious National Health Service take care of you. Hm? What you talking about? This place is actually cleaner than most of the NHS hospitals I've been in. I don't know about the ones you've been in. Have you been in dirty hospitals? Is that why you were struck off? - Maybe you touched a kid, sold some drugs. - All right, all right. Did you kill a lot of people? Are you Harold Shipman? - Is that what you're doing? - You split my stitches open again! I'm sorry! Jack, let him go. It's not his fault. Ohh! Well, you seem to be getting your strength back, anyway. Just don't over-exert yourself, you'll start the bleeding all over again. Hi, I don't speak Dutch. Listen, I just need a packet of cigarettes, please. No, not menthols, just... Yeah. Cheers. Keep the change, don't worry about it. You can't trust him. Hello? Hello? Hello? - Plus no one found the body. - Did he pitch up to work this morning? He's dead. OK. I wouldn't normally do this, but... seeing as you're a man that never misses his target. Plus I need to speak to you about Al Carter... he's starting to become a pain in my arse, and you look like you could do with the money. Sorry, mate, I can't help you there. And why's that? Two reasons - karma and I don't shit where I eat. OK. I'll be in touch. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! The baby! Somebody help! Please! My baby! Oh my God, my baby! Please, somebody! Please help me, somebody! Oh, my God, please help, somebody! Thank you. Oh, my God, please, please be OK! Is he all right? Is he OK? Take him over there, take him over there. Help me, help me! Oh, my God, I know, I know! I'm so sorry! Oh my God, oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come on, man, get up. Are you OK? Thank you so much, you saved my kid! - It's nothing. - What do you mean it's nothing? - You're a hero! This guy's a goddamn hero! - Hey, hey, listen, you're welcome... but I've got my own problems, OK, so just help me slip away quietly. You got it. - Hey, my babyjust fell in the canal. - What's going on? You don't have guard rails here? - I want to know... - You almost killed my kid! - Don't touch me. - Don't touch me! Ow! Saving babies now, are you? Go away. You're dead. It won't be enough. Go back to London. Finish it - for me. Leave me alone, Sid. You jump into a rat-infested river for a total stranger but you weren't there for me? I thought we had each other's backs? I couldn't compromise my cover. You of all people know that. Don't walk away from me! Natasha insisted that we lay low for a few weeks whilst I recovered. I guess she liked the peacefulness of it all. But I was itching to get home. Settle some scores. I think I'm starting to put on weight. I wouldn't worry too much. Next to me you look practically anorexic. It's the waffles. A month of these and I'm getting a distinct belly. So don't eat the waffles. - But they're tasty. - So eat the waffles. But they're fattening. How are you feeling? - Good. Good as new. - Anything bothering you? What do you mean? I don't know about you but I'm going stir-crazy here. What's with all the fucking bicycles, huh? We're the only Brits not wandering around looking dazed and confused. - We'll go back soon. - Do we have to? Look, just one more thing and then it's done. And whilst I'm choking the life out of Carter with one hand, - I'll collect your inheritance with the other. - My inheritance? Thought that would get your attention. What inheritance? Your father stashed away loads of cash way over the years. - I don't think he meant for Carter to take it. - You're gonna rob Carter? Are you mental? That big bad wolf is sleeping in your bed and eating your porridge. He's changed the locks so you can't get back in any more. Isn't that Goldilocks? You know the point I'm trying to make... And when he refuses, spits in my face and chucks me out? You don't know that - he might let you back in. I doubt it. I was never any good at gaining people's trust. Well, you have mine. Let's get out of here before you start ordering more waffles. You're getting fat enough as it is. - We should've creased them. Fuck! - Stop getting agitated. What are we gonna do if he checks them? - Hey, how you doing? - How many? Oh... Two. Live in the UK? Yeah. Where have you been? Amsterdam. We're on our honeymoon. This is your vehicle? - Oh, yeah. - You drive a European car? - Certainly do. - It's a wedding present from my dad. I prefer left-hand drive. Congratulations. Thanks very much. Shall I turn the music down, guv? Yeah, would you? Here's the pictures of your new pub, Mr. Carter. Thank you, Hogan. Are you gonna check out that new place for me? Yeah. - Boss? - Everybody paid? - Yeah. - They always do now. Yeah. Well, it's been nice talking to you. I'm sure you've got books you need to take back to the library. - I don't read. - I can't read. Sorry, that's too subtle. What I actually meant was fuck off. What about this? What do you want me to do with this? The safe's full. Put it down there, I'll check it out later. Pair offucking pricks. Hello, lover. Terry, leave us alone, would you? What the fuck's all this? - I've been shopping. - What do you wanna go shopping for? Clothes. Look at this. This is beautiful. Half price, it was! Half price? I've got a fucking warehouse here full of no price stuff! A dozen for the price of none! Why don't you have a look round here before you go shopping? I mean, God knows what you got here - what's this? - They're jeans. - Yeah, but they're full of holes. - They're designer! - Designer holes? I should've been a fucking designer. I'm in the wrong job here. Have a look at this! Here, put that on! What is your problem? What does it matter if I spend a bit of money? We've got more than we could ever want! Why buy something you've already got? It's called fun! Look, you're in charge now. You control everything. You can take things easy. Things are already easy. They're too easy. I miss the fight. We fight all the time! I'm not talking about you moaning down my earholes. - So you're bored? - No, just stagnating. - When was the last time you went out? - We went out last night. No, when was the last time you went out on collections? The boss don't do collections. - That's the foot soldier's work. - But that's what you miss... the excitement of it. Getting your hands dirty. Maybe I... I could show my face on the street. Get a bit of exercise. Remind people who's in charge. I know who's in charge. Yeah, I know. I was just popping out for a cigarette. I'll be in in a minute. She was scared. I knew we'd be OK as long as we weren't spotted. - Want a bit offun? - Definitely. - Where d'you wanna go? - Somewhere quiet. Yeah, we can go... What the... fuck? Just get out my face. I can't fucking believe that! Bob? You're not gonna believe this. I've just seen a ghost. For everything, there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven. A time to be born, and a time to die. A time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted. A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to break down, and a time to build up. A time to weep, and a time to laugh. A time to mourn... When was the last time you heard from Dominic? He gave me some money and said he'd be in touch. He hasn't. So much for police protection. He does have a habit of leaving people out in the cold. For goodness sake, no one saw us, Jack! But if you keep peering your head out ofthe window, then they will! I was just checking. I could do with a drink. I'll put the kettle on. You ice-skate? Hidden talent! Not so much any more. Actually, I could do with a proper drink. Have you got anything stronger? - Haven't you had enough of that? - I got shot, Natasha. An alleged doctor you brought me to, took the bullet out with salad tongs. It actually hurts a little. I suggest you try it. There's some bourbon in the cupboard. You're welcome. You know, you haven't once thanked me for saving your life. Oh, thank you, Natasha! Thank you, Natasha! Thank you! Nobody made you join the police, Jack. Nobody made you go undercover. Nobody made you creep into our lives and ruin everything! Why didn't you just leave me to die? As soon as I saw that hitman taking aim at you, I knew I had to save you. What? At least I tried. No, what did you just say? As soon as I saw him aiming at you. - You saw the hitman aiming at me? - I saw the rifle. - Why didn't you call out? - I tried to. - You tried to call out? - He'd shot at you already. He was shooting at you, so I shot him in the arm. You shot him in the arm - you didn't kill him? - No. I don't know. - You don't know if you killed him? You were lying there - I was trying to help you. - Call out, that would've helped! - You were lying there bleeding! Right. Don't trust her, Jack, she's a part of all this. Look at her - you know I'm right. You can't trust anyone. Put the chain on if it makes you feel any better. You could wish me luck. Good luck. I don't know what to do. Leave this place. - There is no happiness for you here. - Please help me. - I will. Come over here. - What? Quickly. Can you see him? No. Jack, Jack, Jack! No, he's not here. Dave, Dave, come on, mate, we need to get a wiggle on - somebody must've heard all that shooting! Dave. Dave! Aargh! Aargh! I take it you two had a good lawyer? That's what happens when the key witness dies. Hey, get out of the fucking car. Move! Was with him till Dublin, then they lost all trace. Was the garda of no help? - None. - Typical. Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's been an alert ofshots being fired. - Bank? - Domestic. Have armed response been sent? - Yes, sir. - What you bothering me for, then? Sir, when I entered the address to send the units to, an alert came up. - I haven't set up any alerts. - That's because she's not speaking to you. - Go on. - It's the home of Natasha Evans. OK. We might finally get some answers on where Jack's body is. Go and find her. Nothing? Shit! Everyone knew Carly. She poured the drinks and listened tothe lost souls. Right now I needed someone like that. Right now I just needed someone who wasn't trying to kill me. - Carly, Carly, Carly! It's me. - Jack? You're dead! Yeah, nearly! Jesus Christ, Carly, where did you learn to fight like that? Bruce Lee movies - parents insisted. And here's me thinking I know everything about Carly. Oh, you can talk, OfficerAdleth? It's good to see you. - Did I hurt you? - No. You can say yes. Anyway, thought they would have taught you some slicker moves in the force? No, theyjust stuck us in front of a bunch of Police Academy films. I take it you need something? You know me so well. It's small, but it's off the beaten track. You can come and go through the back, no one will see you. Thanks, Carly, I just need somewhere to... Yeah. It's yours. I still owe you for... Well, I haven't forgotten. You don't owe me anything. Your, er... brother was at the pub asking for you. Christ! Yeah? Well, people think you're dead. It's probably safer that way. I don't like those. Don't worry, it's empty. Look, Jack, why didn't you call? - You know, I could have helped. - You are helping. - When you died... - I didn't die, Carly. - Clearly. - I just disappeared. I went to your memorial. You died. Anyway, your place was raided, but... I got this. - I hid this stuff. - Yeah, I know, you told me. Right. I stole this from my brother. That doesn't surprise me. I don't think it surprised him either. I haven't read this. Erin's writing, isn't it? Erm... Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry. I'll leave you alone. You've got a fucking nerve coming round here! All right, Terry, let her through. This is my dad's business. Yeah, well, I assumed control as soon as your fucked-up family imploded. Just because you were my dad's fixer... Listen, this is my firm now! All you and your sister ever did was distract the guv'nor, which ended up getting him killed. There's nothing for you, unless you want ajob in one of our knocking shops? How fucking dare you! That's my dad's ring! You're nothing but a fucking grave robber! And you're nothing but a spoilt brat held up way too high in your father's estimation. You are not even fit to sit in the same chair as my father. - Terry, get her out. - Get your fucking hands off me! - You're pathetic! You're weak! - There's nothing for you. There's no family, there's no Jack, there's no hope. Jack, we often losethethings we love... ..and if you're reading this, then that's what's happened to us. I wish you could learn to release yourfear oftrusting anyone. I already know the worst thing about you, and it's OK. If it's not too late, leave this life behind and come find me. I'm everything you'll ever need. I'm dreaming. Control, this is C071, detectives on site now. Hello, Matt. Doctor Poulton. Detective Edwards, always a pleasure. This must be Detective Poon? I know Edwards has been looking forward to getting a partner for a while. To be honest, I'm surprised to find you here for something as trivial as aggravated burglary. I'm sure it's nothing to do with the current occupant. I like to keep up with family business. Well, clearly the gorillas had a bit of a grudge to clear up. Have you spoken to them? They're both in hospital. No one's talking. What I want to know is how does a girl that size take out two blokes? Maybe she was taking karate lessons, like you. - Why don't you go and check the bathroom? - Uniform already got it. Yeah, but they might have missed something. So, Matt, what have we actually got? Well, they weren't fighting each other. Someone's done a good job on them and probably got a kicking themselves too. I'm testing the blood here and I think we'll find it's not all theirs. - That'll take a while, yeah? - A bit. OK, a bit. Tell me something... have you fingerprinted that? I can do that. Are you... expecting to find something? - Well, we'll see, won't we? - Yeah, I'll get onto it. OK, great. Oh, Matt, if you do find something, - can you bring it to me first? - Yeah, of course. Good man. Thanks, mate. Right, OK, I'm off in a minute. Just remember to keep the blinds closed and the lights low, - if you do stay in. - It's my fault. Sid... Nathan... Erin. I wiped out a whole family. I don't even know what the sentence for that would be. Do you want me to stay? Anyone who trusts you, sooner or later ends up dead. Leave me alone. It's not too late. You're not real. No? I'm the product of a troubled mind. Do you want me to save you? - Why? I couldn't save you. - No. Can you imagine what it's like to dig your own grave with a gun pointed at your head? They still haven't found my body yet, have they? When they do, I want one of them big East End funerals. Horse-drawn carriages, weeping women lining the streets. The word "geezer" spelt out in massive letters made offlowers. That sounds more like you. Kill 'em all, Jack. Leave no one standing. Then what? Then you can live your whole life. Whatever that'll be worth. - Another drink, detective? - No, thanks, Carly, - I think four's my limit tonight. - What, whilst on duty? Are you sure? We've got a special offer on at the moment. - Yeah? Why's that? - We're a bit overstocked. We don't sell them like we used to. Yeah, I've noticed you're a bit quiet here lately. I'm sure things will pick up soon. That would be great. We'd love it if our regulars came back. I'm sure. Yeah, especially the ones that have been away for a while. Excuse me. - Hello, Matt. - Hello, detective. I've got some very interesting news for you. I think I know what you're gonna say. I ran the prints from the glass. I got a hit almost immediately. It's Jack Adleth. The blood report isn't in yet, so it's possible the glass could be from some months ago... Look, Matt, I think we both know that he's back. I need you to do me a favour and just sit on this for the time being, OK? No, problem, detective. Great. Thanks, Matt. Er, you know what, Carly? I have an overwhelming thirst and I've changed my mind. I'd love that other drink, on the condition that you'll join me? - Discreetly. - Absolutely. So, what shall we drink to? Absent friends. To absent friends. Thank you. Be good. Of all the coppers I've ever known... there's only been one who was straight down the line. No interest in manoeuvring himself into positions of power. He'd never even taken a bribe. Edwards was old school, he didn't play politics. You haven't been checking in. Don't start that again. I'm dead this time. Mum's the word. Keeping secrets is getting more difficult, though, with this stupid new partner of mine. I have to get rid of him before I can get any serious work done. Didn't have you down as the partner type. It's not my idea, it's Dominic's. He's stuck me with some fresh-faced graduate who thinks modern policing is all about the interweb. Technology never was your strong point, was it? No, I prefer knocking on doors to get my answers. You can'tjust goggle everything. - It's Google. - We can agree to disagree, can't we? You can't... Carter tried to have me killed. I don't know about that, Jack. I don't think he's got it in him. You want to look higher up the food chain. But do be careful, things could get very dangerous very quickly. Someone has to pay. Don't you think there's been enough bloodshed? You try losing what I've lost. You know, I was lucky enough to work with your old man, and there was something he told me that made a lot of sense. Do what you gotta do, but then get on with your life. It's good to see you. - Hey! - How you doing, man? - Good. - Where you been? - Holiday. You got the stuff? - Yeah. Nine millies. - Yeah. - Expensive stuff. Sure are. Aargh! Aargh! Aargh! - Hello, Natasha. - Dominic. - Why haven't you returned my calls? - Well, I've been a bit busy. Call of duty and all that, but listen, I've got a window in my schedule right now. Boys. - What is going on? Oi! - There's a good girl. - Get your hands off me right now! Dominic! - Do this the easy way or the hard way... What the fuck do you think you're doing? Oh, yeah, that's right, don't get your own hands dirty! Well, I'm out from the office, aren't I? See you at the station, Natasha! Hi. Members only. - I used to play here all the time. - I haven't seen you before, and Mr. Carter is very particular about his clientele. What a big word for a dumb guy. Fuck... off. Me again. Are we gonna have to do this the hard way? Oh, I hope so. All right, darling? You gonna buy us a drink, then? What the fuck? Please, please, tell me, and do be honest, whoever you are, that you're not actually so stupid that you're trying to rob us, are you? You do know who owns this place? - That's why I chose it. - I can't give you anything. I'm a dead man if I do. Well, you'll be needing a bag. Carter will kill you for this - you do know that? Don't worry, he's tried that one before. You... Get everybody else's money. Get everyone else's cash, now! Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, nothing personal, but this is what happens to you, when you gamble with Alan Carter, you get fucked! I told you. I heard a gunshot and I ran to see what had happened. So you ran towards the sound of a gunshot? Yeah. But when I got there, he was already dead. - You checked? - Yes. Funny, I didn't have you down as a doctor, Natasha, you sure? He wasn't breathing and there was no pulse. I know a corpse when I see one. Don't forget the type offamily I come from. Came from. It's just you and Carter left now, isn't it? He is not my family. Oh, come on, Natasha, don't tell me he hasn't got a special place for you somewhere, hm? I'm sure he could slip you in. You never know... he might even let you call him Daddy. How fucking dare you, you fucking bastard! Don't you fucking talk to me like that again or I'll fucking... Get the fuck off me! What the fuck are you doing? Fuck you! You're a feisty little bitch, aren't you, hm? - Get out. - What? Close the door, and I want you on the other side. - Oh, come on, boss... - Get out! I think me and you need to have a little chat. What about? Mm. Life, the universe, karma. But let's start with Jack, eh? - Well, who the fuck was it? - We don't know. I don't get robbed. I provide protection. This has made me look like a right fucking numpty, like I can't look after my own. Who could be that dumb? Who the fuck could be stupid enough to rob one of my fucking places? I don't know. I know you don't know! You don't know anything, do you? Well, find out who it was. And whoever they are, - they're a fucking dead man! - Yes, boss. Quickly. Ah. I hear we got you to thank for the loss of my favourite undercover pig. You know me, Carter, I don't kiss and tell. Don't be coy - a good job well done deserves a pat on the back, even if it was paid for by the Old Bill. Which brings me to my next point. Now, I've got this pain in my arse, and I don't like things in my arse, so... ..it needs to be removed. Jesus! You two really don't like each other, do you? I like you, Natasha, but I thought we had a deal. He was where you wanted him to be, wasn't he? That's all you wanted. - You didn't need me there. - You're right. I needed someone to guide him into making the right choice, and clearly you did that. Two bullets from two separate guns were found in your sister - looks like neither of you bottled it. Where's Jack? He was already dead when I left. I don't know why they haven't found a body. So you keep saying. Are you feeling guilty? You see, the difference between people like me and Jack, and people like you is, we do what we need to do to get the job done. Still haven't found it, then? Officer! Yes, sir? Escort this young lady out. This way, madam. You know what to do. - Fuck! - Sorry. Jesus, Jack, Carly told you that I'd be coming. Sorry, I was just checking! OK. Go inside. I'm sorry about your place as well. Don't worry about it. Judging by your recent lottery win, you could buy me a new one. It's all yours. I just need a little bit for the life insurance. - Which is expensive when you're dead. - Seriously, what's it for? Relax, sit down for a second. Where have you been all day? I've been worried about you. Dominic virtually kidnapped me. He called me in for questioning. The boss was asking questions about you. - Wait, when was this? - Jack, there's something I need to tell you... about the shooting. - He was behind it. He ordered it. - Who, Dominic?! No, the boss. How do you know that? I saw the hitman at the station. He wasn't working for Carter, he was working for the boss. Jesus fucking Christ, well, that's just fucking great, Tasha! Look, leave it. Let's just get out.. I can't get out! I've just fucking robbed Carter! He doesn't know where we are. Let's just go. - Wait, when was this? - Just now. - And he just let you go? - Yeah. - And you came straight back here? - Yeah. Shit! Christ, you've led them right to us. Why didn't you just hang a sign outside the fucking window? Natasha Davies would like to advertise the fact that Jack Adleth is in Carly's apartment! All fucking armed response units are now welcome! We need to do something! She's lying, she brought them here. She's in on it. - Did you lead them here? - Of course I didn't! - Did you tell them I'd be here? - Kill her! Listen to her. She's as scared as you are. - Shoot her! - Don't do it, Jack. We've got to get out of here. Bag that up. We're not going anywhere without that. Right, I want one unit at the front, and I want two units at the back. Sir, a team is in place and ready to move in. Good, get the fucking public out of here, now. It's OK, I've got a plan. Aargh! Fuck! Man down, repeat man down! Help me move this. Go, go, go. Get him out ofthere. Shoot low. Low. Back, back, back, back, back! Come on! Stay low. Shoot low at the door. Keep shooting. Back, back, back! Ahh! - Fuck... Jack? - Almost there. - I've run out of bullets. - Almost there. Jack, can I point out how speed is very much of the essence here! Come on! Jack, get down, it's you they're after. - Get down! - Go, go! All units, move in! Ground support, open fire on the flat. Ohh! Fuck me, and I was worried about fucking damaging the ceiling! I thought you could get us out ofthe building? My plan was to get us out of the flat. I got us out ofthe flat, didn't I? So, what do we do now? I hadn't thought that far ahead. Come on, we're getting out of here. What's that? They're evacuating the building. That's perfect. - Come on. - What? Nobody knows what we look like. Now's our chance. We cannotjust walk out there! Nobody knows! Come on, we've got two minutes. Come on, quickly. Come on quickly, come on quickly. Quickly, quickly! Come on, come on! Aargh! - Control, suspects are not in the flat. - Gas! Get the fuck out! Out, out! IC1 female wearing a blue coat, repeat, IC1 female wearing a blue coat. Move! Fucking move! Out the way! You, out the fucking way! Fuck! Move, move! OK, stop, stop, stop. - You OK? You OK? - Yeah. OK. OK, we've got to get out of here. Come on, let's go. Tab? No, you're all right, thanks. Edwards. Hello, Mum. Yeah. OK, soon as I can. Yeah. Hm. OK, bit of a family crisis, my mum's taken a turn, so, er... well, you go back to the station. I'll take a walk, all right? We're not off duty yet. Detective Poon, I am going to see my dear old mum in hospital, before she picks up some fucking superbug, all right? So why don't you leave me alone, piss off back to the station and do some paperwork? I know you enjoy that. Yeah, you said to call if Edwards looks like he's slipping away. Yeah, he's slipping. OK, then you follow him. ..was being cleared by police. I want to know everywhere he goes, and everyone he meets. ..caused by a gas leak. A police spokesman said no one was injured due tothe efficiency... Pow! Always check your blind spot, never drop your guard. It's good to see you, Damien. So... who's your friend? This is Natasha. Natasha, this is my brother Damien. - Hi. - Hi. You two don't sound like brothers. Well, you pretend to be somebody for too long, and your old self disappears, isn't that right, bro? Yes. - Do you mind if I take a bath? - Sure, it's, er... through there. - Nice. - Can I leave her with you for a little bit? - Sure. - I won't be long. - Can you stay? - No, well, for a minute. - How you doing? - Drink? Sure. You still drink this? It's our favourite. It was. - How are you? - OK, you know, just, um... You know, Dad used to say there's only two acceptable reasons not to call in - one's amnesia, one's if you're dead. I've been thinking more and more about this life, and what it means for people like us. How far is too far. - You mean sacrifice. - I know that. - Do you? - Yeah. It's the reason I struggle to call you my brother, cos I don't remember you around enough in that capacity... especially after Dad left. You know, Damien, you might be full of his pearls ofwisdom, but he didn't stick around long enough to pass them on to me, and neither did you. Mum wouldn't have wanted this for us. It was always tough with Mum. She was always worried about me, but mostly about you. Mum was a worrier. You know, Dad used to say that he used to make things up, you know, in case she ran out of things to worry about. You still sound like her. Whenever you speak, I hear her voice. All I can hear is Dad's. - So, what was it? - What was what? What did this life cost you? A girl. The girl. This life, this job that you've chosen, it takes a lot, you know? Sometimes the sacrifices are too much. Just cos you're the last man standing, it... doesn't mean you're the winner. It's just alive. Well, being alive and living, two very different things. I remember. Stay. Can't. You and me, bro... we're the same. Surely I'm better looking? Well, that's something you got from Mum. Do you miss her? You take care of yourself. Hello, Mum. - You're late. - Yeah, got lost in the maternity ward. See anything familiar? All this time, Edwards, I've been fucking worried about Carter, when it's my own boss sending hitmen after me. He thinks you're too much of a risk. You gonna let me bring you in? Not yet. You do realise I'm the only one who probably wants to bring you in alive? - Yes, I did notice. - You've got enough to whistle-blow on him. Ifthey scratch beneath the surface, they'll find something to put him away with. You're one ofthose glass-half-full fuckers, aren't you? Well, I try. Just one more thing and then it's done. OK, so what do you need from me? A meeting... with the man that shot me. I'll do my best, but I do not like to get blood on my hands. Boss. You'll never guess who Edwards is talking to. Yeah. And then I'll send you a blank postcard, and you can come and work on my boat with me. Yeah, course I will. And Jack... try not to get killed again. Not many people come back from the dead twice. Look out for the postcard. If you want something done... do it yourself. - Are you the pro? - I never miss my target. Ain't that the truth! Look, I just wanna talk. Want another? No. - Nice place. - Thanks. Yeah, I like what you've done with it. Looks like it cost you. See, the previous owners didn't take care of the place. - Ended up a right mess. - Is that right? Yeah. You could say things turned ugly in the end. Shame they had to go. See, apparently, they didn't have the right type of insurance. - Really? - Mm. You see, people think thatjust because times are tough, they can scrimp on these things. So short-sighted. I mean, take that cabinet, for instance. Now, I know you had that put in, because the last one was broken. I know for a fact the last one was broken. Now, how much would that cost to get replaced? Well, it would cost a lot, wouldn't it? But see, ifyou're insured, you don't have to worry about these things. It's all taken care of. I mean, just imagine ifthere was a fire... in here. All this nice new furniture. All this stock. Prrr! But see, if you've got the right insurance - you're covered. I have insurance. Well, that's just great. Got nothing to worry about, then, have you? Anyway, I'd best be off. I'm sure I'll be back again soon. Hi. Is it worth it? Killing Carter is just one of those things that needs to be done. I'm just somebody making sure it is. Don't you want what's owed to you, Tasha? Who made you judge, jury and executioner? Go back to sleep. Didn't you make enough out of Carter's gambling den? Your father had a massive contingency fund stashed away in that building. I know about it and I can tell from the look on your face, you do too. But do you think Carter knows? This isn't about the money, Jack. Of course it's not about the fucking money, Tasha! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just one more thing and then it's done. One lastjob? Sounds ominous, doesn't it? Don't worry, I'm gonna take care of you, like you took care of me. Are you saying you see a gunfight in our near future? You don't have to be involved. You can go, this is my responsibility. Jack, you're not responsible for me. Let me be. Come on. Lie down. You can't sleep like that. I'm OK. I won't bite. Right. Who's there? An old friend. Doctor Lawrence? I'm dreaming. Of course you are. You know, shrinks aren't supposed to do house calls, or even stadium calls. So why are we here? You're the psychiatrist, why don't you tell me? Ifyou're dreaming me, you should know everything I know. So, what, I'm talking to myself? I like to think of it more as... the better-looking, more intellectual version of you. OK, so why you, why here? Because I think we've found your happy place. You love this ground, and you trust me. You know, you undercover guys, you're trained not to give anything away. Myjob is the application of time and pressure... until you eventually crack. Hey, fuck you, I never cracked! - I've been lying to everyone! - I know, I know, I know. But who can you trust, Jack? Completely? Sid trusted you. Sid knew the risks when he took the job. We all did. And Erin... did she know the risk when she was with you? You were supposed to protect her. - Or is she as responsible as you are? - Release me. You're not tied down, Jack. You're free to go whenever you want. But you can't... because you're trapped in here. I don't understand. You will. Let's just hope it's not too late. Let me wake. It's gonna hurt. What? Ah! Aargh! Do you think he'll be a problem? There shouldn't be. We never had a problem there before. Well, new management, new people take over. They get funny ideas. - Don't we know it. - You got something to say? - Looks nice. - It is. They've spent a fortune kitting the place out. I mean, you seen that, boss? Well, give it a couple of days, take the gorillas, go round there, work out some payments. If he wants to get funny, chuck a couple of those tables through the mirror, beat the shit out of him and any staff, and nick a load ofthose bottles, because that is expensive champagne. Champagne? Oh, I thought that would get your attention. - Shit. - What is it, boss? Are you sure these were taken last night? Yeah. Yeah, it was me who took them. - Fuck! - What is it, hon? What's going on, boss? Who the fuck else do you think was sitting in that bar last night? Who does that look like to you? - That's, um... - It's Jack. It's Jack Adleth, you stupid cunt! He's sitting at the same fucking bar and you don't even see it. How stupid are you? Did your mother drop you on your head when you were a baby? - Well, no. - Well, she fucking should've done. Go and make sure everything is secure. Now! All right. What's wrong with you? So this guy is back. What are you so scared of? - I'm not scared. - Yes, you are. You have the exact same look on your face when I mention my mother. Do you know what the most important thing in life is? What? Family. It's on the back seat. Any use? Where is Jack, huh? You don't have a brother, do you? He's here. He's here! He's in the buil... Aargh! Lennie, are you there? - Aargh! - Lennie? Lennie are you there? Shit! Aargh! Aargh! Ah! - Where is he? - I don't know what you're talking about, mate. Where's Carter? Aargh, aargh, aargh! Where's Carter? I don't know where they are. Aargh! All right. All right. He took her to his pub on London Road. He took who? Who? Your feisty little bitch. How did you find her? How did you find her? I take it you ain't been home yet? What have you done? Where's my brother? You see, when Mr. Carter gives you an order, you follow it. It wasn't personal. Aargh! The only reason he would think that is because you told him. I know you're looking at that pistol, but it's closer to me than it is to you. - Come here! Keep still. - Get your fucking hands off! Calm down, Jack, calm down. Now listen, I want you to know, that I had absolutely nothing to do with Amsterdam. Now, on the count ofthree, I'm gonna put this pistol down. One... two... Three! I will fucking kill you, you fucking cunt. I'll fucking kill... Ow, my fucking arm! Seems like you've been a naughty boy, Jack. You're not so fucking clean yourself! What did you do, come to finish me off? Aargh! That's not gonna work with you now, is it? You just won't go away. You're like a big shit that won't flush! Karma said to me that when you survived Amsterdam, or could it be I'm becoming a little... sentimental? That's it. That's it, Jack, a little sentimental, but anyway, fuck all that bollocks. It's good to see you, Jack! You better kill me while you've still got the chance, it won't come again. - Give me my father's ring. - Aargh! You grave-robbing bastard! You're not fit to sit in the same chair as that man. What's with the same ring? I haven't always been a copper, sweetheart. I had a past, you know. He went his way and I went mine... ..but we always showed each other respect. Sounds like you were a pair offucking Marys anyway. A pair of Marys. Did you hear that, Jack? He said we look like a couple of Marys. Do you think I look like a Mary? Do you? Stay! OK, let's do this as quickly and quietly as possible. I need all areas checked, especially the exits. Tighten up! I need you at the front. Boss, boss, can you hear me? Can you hear me, boss? Has anybody got eyes on? Eyes on. I need a visual. Anybody got eyes on? I've got eyes on the boss and two suspects, do you want me to take them down? Negative. Do not fire unless he's in danger. Let her go. You've got me. That's what you wanted, isn't it? You want me to let her go after what she did to you, Jack? Ever the noble gentlemen. Oh, how forgiving. She was the one who got you where you needed to be, Jack... in order for you to get shot. She wasn'tthereto kill Natalie... you was quite capable of doing that yourself. She was thereto make sure everything wentto plan. Oh, and you're gonna love this bit, Jack. If you was to show up with cover, or by some freak of nature the hitman was to miss and it all went wrong... ..you was gonna finish him off, wasn't you? Stay with me, stay with me! Jack, stay with me. Jack, can you hear me? You fucking... Didn't I tell you to watch your back, Jack? I didn't go through with it. I wanted to save you. I had to save you. Of course she had to save you, Jack. Know why? She needed to get you back here, that's why. That's not true. Oh, it's so true, Jack. It's so true. Tell you what, my friend... have this one on me. Go on. Shoot her. Raise the gun, Jack. Jack? Go on, Jack. You think she's got a conscience, Jack, do you? He's right, look at her, she's guilty as fuck. She wants you dead! She saved you. She cares about you. Don't do something you'll regret. Pull the trigger, Jack. Point the gun. Pull the trigger. Shoot her. Hold fire. Do not fire unless he intends to use it! You can do it, Jack. Raise the gun, Jack. Raise the gun and pull the trigger, Jack. Do it, Jack! He's dropped the weapon. Everyone move in! Go, go, go! So disappointing. Not to worry. You're not going anywhere. You're too dangerous to be released into society. - Armed police! Armed police! - Armed police! Good luck making that story stick, when everyone hears about your involvement in this. Utter one word about me, Jacky boy, and your little princess here... she's gonna be found in body bags all over London... and that's me being generous. You live, she gets to go. And that's the best offer you're gonna get. You're going away for murder. How do you plead? Guilty. Jack Adleth, it has become clear to me, from studying the overwhelming evidence, what a reckless, insidious, dangerous, underhanded and ruthless individual you are. These are not the qualities we expect in a police officer. You offered the facade that you were part of the thin blue line that divides decent society from lawless, feckless, and dangerous people. As law-abiding citizens, we have the right to expect the utmost professionalism, honour and commitment to duty, from those we assign to protect us. Regarding the death of Mr. Alan Carter... it is apparent that you showed no mercy or remorse. It is for that reason that I must impose the maximum sentence available to me. Society must be protected from individuals as dangerous as yourself. I sentence you to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 30 years. Take him down. I knew he couldn't resist seeing it all first-hand. And that meant he'd be in a particular place at a particulartime. That was all I needed. Fuck! Shit! Boss? Boss? Fuck! Get me an ambulance now! Emergency assistance required at the courthouse. I need backup, shots fired... It's all yours. I just need a little bit for the life insurance. You're asking... to hire me? It's just business, isn't it? I suppose it is. Want anything special? Yeah - repeat Amsterdam. He's always been a fan of karma. You're the boss. Jack wanted you to have this. It's beautiful. Now everything is done. Just one more thing, mate... then it's done. I love you. I'll see you soon. We meet again, Jack. Dumb and dumber. You know, it really is a small world. ? City streets ? Play for keeps ? Running wild ? For miles ? Every day ? Fades away ? Into dreams and changes things ? Understand ? What you can ? Looking back ? Where's Jack? ? He was here ? With a fear ? In the mist where angels kissed ? Turn around ? Lost and found ? Dressed in black, all comes back ? Where's Jack?
