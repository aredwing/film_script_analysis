 

                        1 No. Don't! Oh, oh, oh. You have six new messages. North, it's Beth. I heard what happened. I'm so sorry. This call is for Mr. North Maxfield. This is a courtesy call regarding your mortgage with us here. Ginny, hi. It's Joan from Willow fitness. Hey, it's Beth. I'm not sure if this will help, but here's the number of the doctor you and Carl discussed. Her name is Dr. Sarah Carson, 405... North, it's mom. I'm here at the airport. I wish you would come home with us. If you change your mind... Does it work? Depends. On? Who you're working with and what you do with it. I've had a lot of success with people who are open to it. Hmm! What brought you to me? My wife was murdered a month ago. The police say they'll probably never catch whoever did it. I woke up in the hospital. I'm sorry to hear that. But not her, she was gone. She wasn't there with me. Are you on any doctor prescribed medications? Not anymore. Why hypnosis? I remember some things, they're just gaping holes. Have you tried writing this down? No, thank you. It's never anything but bits and pieces anyway. The truth is in those bits and pieces. These used to mean something. Now they're just reminders of a job I can't do anymore. What's that like? Everything is jumbled in my head. Things don't make sense anymore. I can't remember things. Her... If I could just see her... If I could just understand how it happened... I think I could put this All back together. There are many different techniques for hypnosis. Some are like guided meditations, or are conscious of everything around you. What I do is deep trance hypnosis. I lead you into your subconscious with an intention, and there we reconnect the memories. How does it sound? If it helps me remember, I'm game. You may experience a sensation of lightness, you may feel you're floating, out of body experience. Is that still okay? - Sure. - Good. Let's begin. Study my hand. Hear the calmness in my voice. I want you to concentrate on, and only on my index finger. You may hear the sounds in the room, but none of that matters as you focus on the sound of my voice. Watch... as the other fingers fall away. Breathe... As I count down, five, four, three, two, one. Don't try to find a memory All at once. Remember a piece, an element... Of your wife... And your life together. Find your own internal guide and follow it. Where would you like to go today? Element. Ginny! Can you hear the sound of my voice? It worked. You were under about sixteen minutes. It only felt like moments. It's a different world there. People are different, time is different. This memory is a piece. You build on that. Can I come back? Of course. Morning, Beth. Keep your head down, Carl is on the warpath. Alan, hi. Hey, how's your wife? I'm sorry to hear that. Um... Right, right, I just wanted to check in about what we had talked about six months ago, I just... No, no, no. I understand, I hear what you're saying and... and I don't think you need to move this account. I really don't. I want you to feel like you can completely trust me again. Ah, I'm better, I really am, I mean, I'm back. That's why I wanted to call you today. So, here is what's going on. Yes, I did have a head injury, I got your "thank you" card, I really appreciate it. I'm back two hundred percent. Trust me, if You'll just have a little faith in me, just have a little... An ounce of faith in me, which I know you find hard. I get it, I get that you're worried about me, I get that you're worried about, you know, where we're going, I promise you, twenty-five percent. I hear you, I need you to reconsider. I just, I need you to think about this, I mean, I, just listen to me, okay, I know what I'm talking about. Thank you, Mr. Wong. Ah, yeah. - How you feeling? - I'm doing fine, doing fine. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about... We're taking a different route, we got some new ideas, some emerging markets. Look, let's have lunch? I just don't think that's a good idea. - Hey, no, no, no. Wait, wait. - No. Albert, how's Hollywood? Yeah, I know. You can't do this to me Albert, I mean... Hey man, it's Carl, call me back. Three, two, one. Element. My wife. This was the night. I died shortly after this. What happens after this? Are you sure you're ready to remember? Soon. What was different this time? When I'm under, it's real. - I'm with her. - But it's not real. She's not really there. You need to let her go. I can't let go. She says I'm not ready yet. It's your mind that's not ready. You need to be out, talking, meeting people... Not isolating yourself. Sometimes letting go of someone is how you find the answers. If I let go, she'll be gone forever. So, what's it like? It's amazing. It's like a dream you don't want to wake up from. How did you get into it? My wife died. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's a long story, but it's the only way I can still feel close to her again. Hmm. How'd she die? - I don't know. - You don't know? I mean, she was shot. That's terrible. I just don't remember a lot from that night. Hmm, maybe next time you're under you could ask her. Guess I never thought about that. - I should get going. - Is it something I said? No, you seem like a really nice guy, but you're still married. That's not what I was... I wasn't... I wasn't trying to... All right. How are things at work? Work is getting harder and harder. There's a lot of pressure there. My boss... The guy who runs our department is riding me hard because of my memory issues. We really haven't talked about these issues. Why don't we discuss those next time? I'm going to be late for work. Remember... I can't make you feel or do anything. You don't lose your free will, you're always awake, always aware, and always in control. Watch, as the other fingers fade away. Breathe. The count down... Five, four, three, two, one. Element? Home. I know I was wrong, I'm sorry. I was overwhelmed. Overwhelmed? No, I mean, I wasn't... I wasn't thinking. No shit! Who put you up to this? - No one. - You're lying, I know you. You might have gone along with it, but you wouldn't have done it on your own. I can get out of this. Did you think about me; About what it would do to us? I did this for us! Ginny, please... As much as you want to keep seeing me, you know where this goes. I don't see you here like this anymore. You're going to have to remember on your own. She's going to wake me up... Please don't leave, stay with me. You're going to come out, now. How long was I out? Fifty-seven minutes. She was there with me at home. It was after dinner the night she was killed. You didn't make it home that night. I tried to change it. Hypnosis is a bridge between our conscious and our subconscious. You can't create a memory to suppress another. It's the easiest way to forget what's real and what isn't. That's your last one, north. At least somebody is looking out for me. Tell me where it is! Yeah, uh, no. I'll call you back. You're late. - Traffic. - And your phone is off. There's so much shit going on around here for your phone to be off. Sorry. Andrex, where are you with that report? I need those numbers. I need access to those accounts. They're our biggest client. And we ought to be able to give them something. Put them on hold. Nothing's on hold. It's been three months since you... You know it's at risk if we don't give them something, right? I can't remember, I'm trying. Still seeing that woman, that shrink? Of course. How's that going? I got to give them some reassurance. I mean, they've been more than patient with us at this point. But sooner or later, I got to pull the trigger. So, you take some time off and you figure this out. And I need to be able to call you on your phone if I need your help, okay? I'm trying to be understanding here, but you need to get your shit together, for both of our sake. - Look, if I could just... - This is not a discussion. Because with everything you know about this place, our clients and the people we work with... I can't have you this fucking incomprehensible. I will burn you if you don't give me what I want. - No. - Tell him where it is! - Her! - No, don't! - - They're going to come for you now. This is unexpected. I'm sorry to bother you, can I come in? You didn't call to make an appointment. I know but, it's... Got bad today. I didn't know where else to go. I'm not seeing any other patients till this afternoon, but... you can't just show up like this in the future. Understood. Is there something you want to talk about? Just put me under. What do you want to find? I want to go back to my wife, she was going to tell me something before I remembered the argument. How did you meet Ginny? We met at a work function when I got out of college. I was working at a startup investment firm, I went to one of the client's fundraisers - and she was there. - Love at first sight? Yeah, it was. We were... Inseparable, got married six months later. Things were good. And then one day you wake up and look over... And wonder how you got here. - Did you argue? - Sure. What did you argue about most? Money. What else did you argue about? Everything! It's possible that this history of conflict has created a barrier. There's only one way to find out. Hear the sound of my voice. I want you to open your eyes on one hundred, close on ninety-nine. One hundred, ninety-nine. Relax your breathing. Feel the weight of your body leave you. Element? - My wife. - Element? I want to see her one more time, please. I know you can answer me. Element. Revenge. I know... It doesn't make sense. Did she have to die? I need to see Ginny. You have to take me to her. Don't wake me up! Take me to Ginny. Don't wake me up! No! Holy fuck! How long was I out? Seventy-two minutes. - That was... - Intense! Your memories are building. When can I come back? Let me get my appointment calendar. No, no, no. I'll call you back. I'll call you back. - So, what did they say? - As if you don't know. Come on, be more specific. I can't remember anything. Son of a bitch is running out of time. I know, I'm working on it. Don't tell me that. I am gonna start wondering what your problem is. If I ask one more time, we're going to make a lot of people nervous. What do you want from me? There is the other way. Leave your cell phone on. I'll be in touch. Can I try a reposado, please? Drinking alone? - Looks like it. - They say that's bad luck. Who's they? Thank you. Do I know you? Sorry, you just look really familiar to me. - I'm Anna. - North. - North? - Uh-huh. I like it. You from around here? No, visiting. - Family? - Work. Cheers. What about you? You live around here? I do. Married? Ah, I was. What do you do for work? I was a financial Advisor. - Was? - Taking a break. It's that bad? Ask me again in an hour. Probably won't be here in an hour. I'm also in town to see my new therapist. Is that bad to admit? Of course not. What kind of therapy? Why? You need somebody to talk to? Maybe! You ever heard of Ericksonian technique? Yeah, I've heard of him. My therapist is in his style. I don't know, I may or may not see him again. Did you call a cab? Yes, thank you. So, I have a couple of meetings in the morning. I thought maybe we could grab a coffee after, and you could tell me more about this therapy I signed up for? - Do I have a choice? - No! Don't forget. You getting hers? I guess so. I want to speak to Ginny. Based on your interaction with her in the trance world, I'm not sure that's the best approach. Why? Have you ever kept a secret, really kept one... Something about yourself you can't discuss? The mind works the same way. I don't understand. Whatever secret your mind is hiding, Ginny is not the one with the answers. - It lies elsewhere. - Then how do we find it? I'd like to try a different technique to put you under. A simple handshake. Action learned as a single chunk of behavior. Tying your shoelaces is another example. When that action is diverted... The mind responds by suspending itself in trance. What is this? - Element? - Why did you bring me here? What do you want me to see? Take me back to my office. I need to understand why the accounts were changed. Element. There's nothing else. Tell me why you brought me here? North! North! How long? Nearly two hours. You can't force your mind to travel places it doesn't want to go. I came here to be with my wife. Why can't she take me to her? I don't know about can't, but she won't. She has to. No, I think it's like when you were a senior, I was, like, potty training. You probably don't even know who Elvis is, do you? Oh, okay, nice. Or we can talk about hypnosis some more. Thank you for listening, seriously. You're welcome. I had fun today. Me too. It's been a while since I've been out. With what, another woman? Doesn't matter. So, this is the infamous wall? That's it. What are the empty spots? Those are of the things I've figured out. Fascinating. Well, it's a work in progress, but... No, I meant you. Hey! You okay? Yeah. Where you headed? Work, travel, home. I'll be back. When? Soon! Last night... It was... But... It's too soon. It's okay. Disappointing, but it's okay. Can I get a zip up, please? Can I ask you something? Sure. Are you starting to remember your wife's death? I'm not sure I want to. Would knowing be worse than what you're putting yourself through now? I'm not going to tell you it's time to move on, but denying your memories, repressing them who you are, who you were... I just think you're strong enough to handle it. You don't know me. Yeah, but... I'm older and wiser, and I know that living in a dream world is a good way to lose sight of the real world. That's exactly why I do it. I get it, but it doesn't solve anything. They're still... here. There are seven billion people on this planet. There are those of us that like ourselves and those that don't. You accept it and you move forward. I know what you're saying. Do you? I have to go. Call me? Can I help you? You can't, he can. We're in a meeting here. Is that right? Andrex, I'm finding things, this doesn't add up. Add up? You're a fucking nightmare, you know that? What is this? Excuse me. This, this is cancer. Now if we don't get a hold on this now, everything's blown. And everybody is going down with this ship. What are you telling me? I'm asking you to do the right thing here. Why are you changing their quarterly reports? When the fuck did you become so soft? Jesus! You want me to cover this for you? You want me to tell them their returns add up just fine? They're not going to notice that while oil and gas prices rose, their royalty payments remained stagnant? Keep your voice down. You can't just Bernie Madoff this shit. You're talking about millions of dollars, messing with signatures, fraudulent IRS documents and god knows what else, from andrex. You know how powerful they are, are you fucking crazy? You want to practice your babe in the woods routine, be my guest. But how exactly do you think those numbers got turned around? Ahh. No, I didn't. Yes, yes you did, partner. Do you have access to those Cayman accounts now? No, what accounts? God damn it. Find it. Are you sleeping with him? No, but it looks like I'm going to have to. Hi, you've reached my voicemail, please leave a message. Hey, it's me. Ah, just calling to see if you're free to talk? I had kind of a rough day, so just... Could use someone to talk to. Anyway, call me back. Bye. Joseph! Carl! What are you doing here? Hmm. I'm done playing games. Please... don't! Don't kill me! Then talk to me. It's on the jump drive. What? It's on the jump drive. North hid it. Come on, now, relax and enjoy it. Relax now, come on. Come on, now, relax and enjoy it. Picture yourself descending a flight of stairs, counting each step down starting at ten. As you take a step, feel the step under your foot. Once you get to the last step, imagine and truly feel yourself stepping off into a relaxing pool of water. Feel yourself falling down through the water deeper and deeper. You should start to feel somewhat numb. Your heart will start to race a bit. Embrace it. Just let the fears about your situation just drift away into the water. Element? You already know what I want, don't you? Two hundred. Yeah, I'm out. Your 200... And 400 more. Let's see what you've got. The bet's 600 to you, sir. I'm out. Fold. Fold. So... you really don't know who I am, huh? Not a clue? I don't know you. That's right. The shoe doesn't know me, I forgot. Should I? Maybe not. Maybe, no. Maybe not. Hey, it's on you. You going to talk or play cards? You can piss off. You like that? Watch this. You really don't get it, do you? I was in Carl's office, but that's not where you would know me. What the fuck! You were the one. They're going to come for you now. What happened? How did you... - Why are you on the floor? - How the hell did you do that? - You need to go. - Wait! Shit! Let me think. There were others, strangers, I was attacked. Hmm. Did I hurt you? How was I able to do that? I don't know. Just go! She knew, she already knew where I wanted to go. How is that possible? I'm sorry. Please, please, just help me understand! I didn't agree to do this, just go! I just want you All to just go away! Get the fuck out of here! Yeah, hello? North? It's Beth. What's happened? Carl Mackey, he killed himself. They think he overdosed. North? North? I'm a patient of hers. Yes, she knows who I am. Why won't she call me back? I know you're an answering service, I get that. Yes, this is an emergency, why do you... Fine, just have her call me back, thank you. God damn it! North Maxfield? Yes. Can we talk for a moment? What's this about? Carl Mackey. Interesting choice in decor. Beth said that Carl killed himself. Did he leave a note? Depends on how you view that question. Oh, now, that is an interesting note. Found it stuck to his computer, so it's pretty new. Do I need to get a lawyer? I don't think so, but I have been known to be wrong from time to time. Any idea what this note is about? Not a clue. Now, the interesting thing to me is the little argument you two had. Now, the way I understand it from your colleagues, you bashed his face in his desk. Now, if it were me, I would press charges, but I know how you investment types are at protecting each other from the outside world, while stabbing each other in the back. It wasn't a big deal. "Burn this motherfucker", doesn't sound like no big deal. One guy has something on the other, stuff like this happens. - Am I going to jail? - Not today. Where were you night before last? Here, working. - Anyone with you? - No, no one was with me. But I'm sure I made some calls from here. Did you have any idea that Mr. Mackey was shooting up? I mean, everyone said that he was acting edgy lately, but... but not strung out. I wouldn't know. I haven't spoken to him much lately. Not since your wife. I heard. Listen, I need to get back to work. So what did you have on him anyway, huh? I think I'd like you to leave. I mean, why are you getting so defensive? I'm still dealing with the death of my wife. Sarah! Are you here? What are you doing here? - I need your help. - I can't see you. Please, I'm desperate. That's exactly why I can't see you anymore. What does that mean? - You've become dependent. - Dependent on what? What did you expect by coming here? I came here for help, to remember. - To feel normal again. - Do you? Do you feel normal? - That's not the fucking point. - Answer the question. - Do you feel normal? - Not in a very long time. I have headaches, thoughts of shit I can't make sense of. Nosebleeds? You didn't tell me about that. My nose bleeds, they're getting worse. Those are side effects I'm talking about. I puke into the garbage can every time I wake up from being asleep. You've become addicted. To hypnosis? Are you kidding me? Stop it! Stop it! No, no, no, no. The truth you've been looking for, you've found it. You just won't admit it. Fuck you! You know that, fuck you! Fuck you. Please! Please, please, I'm sorry. Please. Listen to me. Listen to me! I won't put you under anymore. They... listen... they might be able to help you more than I could. The other day you said something. What did you mean when you said, "you wanted us All to go away"? He's close. Picture yourself descending a flight of stairs. Counting each step down. Starting at ten. Deeper, and deeper... Element. What's happening to me? Is this the beginning or the end? I'm sorry, I was traveling, I didn't call. You said you would. What happened to your face? Who did this to you? Can I come in... Please? What is this? - Where are your band-aids? - Bathroom. - I called. - I know you did. My doctor won't see me anymore. Why? The last time I was under, I attacked her. While you were in trance? So, what has this have to do with your face? There was a man after me. He was chasing me with a gun, he gave me this. Where, in your subconscious? Just let me get to... Tell me, how is that even possible? So, you hurt yourself? I went under, this wasn't there. I came out and it was. Okay, wait. Who put you under? - I did. - When? Tonight. He finds me now. He finds me and it's like he's trying to kill me. But I feel like the answers are right there. What can I do? If these people are coming after you in your trance, that must mean something, right? I think Ginny was a mistake. I'm just... I'm right there, I'm so close. Why are you here? I... I don't know what you mean, I... I mean, why did you come back? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't here. What if I do it, what if I put you under? No. What if I don't come out of it? I won't let you go. Mmm-mmm. Okay. How could you have done this? Carl said we could get away with it. These companies have hundreds of millions of dollars and tons of investments, they never realize their royalty payments were a little low. I did this for us. For us? And that makes it okay? And this woman you've been seeing, what about her, was she part of your plan? I was afraid Anna was on to us, I had to find out. North, wake up! Why is she here? Why is she here? Where are you? Who are you with? What do you see? Why did you bring me here, answer me? No! Anna! Where are you? You should have been here by now. North? Don't scream. North, please! - What are you doing? - How did she know? Answer me! I don't know what you're talking about. My wife! She knew about you. - How? - She didn't. How? Answer me or I swear... Tell me who sent you? Stop this. You are scaring me, please. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I want you to give me the gun, okay. Let me help you. Oh! You are a liar! You're a liar. I can explain, okay. But if you hurt me, there are huge consequences. You will never wake up from this. I don't plan to. Out, we're going out now. She showed me where this ends. North, you are losing it. I know what's real and what's not. Why did you ransack my place? - I didn't, you're crazy. - I don't believe you. Stop it! Who are you? Who sent you? No one sends me anywhere. Get off of me. I still can't believe you don't remember who I am. Andrex, Anna andrex. And you stole my money. North! Wait, wait. Wait. You're so late. Well, it seems that the doctor has been playing both sides against the middle. What? Who? Justice department. Found this card at her place. It's the same one that was on his wall. I knew it. I'm sorry. Were you ever trying to help me? Yes. Please, north. From the moment I met you, I knew you were a good man. That was before. I've done things. I'm not who I was. Yes, you are. Ginny's gone. You remember why now, don't you? What happened? Accept the truth, it's the only way out of this. This is getting us nowhere. Just wait. Is she with us? Is she here? The money you stole, where is it stashed? No, forget it. Tell him where the money is. What are you going to do... Kill me? No, her. No, no! You know what this makes you? A witness. I got her killed. I got her killed. If I had just told you, she'd still be here! North, you won't hurt me. Here's how this ends. You give me back the money you stole, you do this for me and we All walk away. You can have a fresh start. You and your wife could have a fresh start. This is your chance. You're close to the numbers and you know them well. You do this, we could talk about immunity from what you've done. I will be with you through the whole process. Think of me as your guide, I'm going to provide you All the elements you need. I was getting out. I was getting out. Why didn't you come find me? After the accident... You lost it. Your memory... You were going to talk to Ginny about it that night and get back to her with an answer. What are you talking about, get back to who? His little angel in the justice department. This... This is All you want. This is All they want. This will destroy you. What was on the drive? Those are for you. North, don't do this to me. Ginny didn't have to die. Element. All of your visions Seeping inside me All your wisdom Draw your conclusions I'm breaking into Through this illusion I'm looking to Pure distraction So like an intrusion Of your concentration Here in the frequency Inside of me In this moment In this instant Not sure what I believe Try not to let go Find All your reasons Try to collect them To possibly trade in I'm stepping in stars Forwards and backwards Pure, pure distraction Of your concentration Alter my sixth sense Here in the frequency Inside of me In this moment In this instant Not sure what I believe Here in the frequency...
