 

                        I could fall asleep... With the warmth of you near me. The sound of your heart sings. Sings what? Together... Together. [ phone ringing ] Tomassini residence? She's not available at this moment, Can I take a message? Thank you. It's really coming down. I'm Paolo. Djuna. So do you live here? No. My friend is doing a play in the city, So I'm staying in her house. What about you? I'm here writing a script. They got me a house, to write. You know, no distractions. You're, what? Artist? No. I translate poetry and literature into Different languages. That sounds like a pretty serious job. It's practical. I have a...Skin condition...Where I can't be Exposed to sunlight. I' m sorry. This place is huge. No, go! This was a mistake. I'm sorry. It's not a mistake. I want you to leave. I'm gonna leave, but I'm gonna call you tomorrow. No, don't call. Go. Please go. Through phone: Hey Paolo, it's donna. I've been thinking a lot, and I don't know why I said I needed I was really happy with the way things were. It was stupid. And I think that's great, I really do. Tomassini residence. Madame is indisposed until this evening. May I take a message? Paolo. Very well, I'll let her know. You should try some of our other scotches. We've got some great scotch. You interested? Yeah, sure. Here you go. Thanks. What are you doing here? Will you let me in? I can't. Is this about your illness? Yes. Look, whatever it is you have, I will deal with it. Just let me in. No. Let me in. No. Djuna? Get out! Hey ben. Hey, how's it comin'? You love your house? Alright, don't say I don't take care of you. I don't. How's it coming, p? I just started. Of course it's gonna be great, you're gonna knock this I know you're not into violence, but don't be afraid of it here. It's the right thing. I won't. Feelin' good? Yeah. Paolo? Hello? Paolo, where are you? Paolo? Paolo? Hey, Paolo! Hey. Sorry. Paolo . I'm comin' over. Answer the door. Come over here. Feel my heart. Find my heartbeat. It's not there, Paolo. I can't go in sunlight. I drink the blood of animals to live. Do you understand what I'm telling you? You're telling me you're a vampire? Are you kidding me? What do think happened last night? There's no such thing as vampires, djuna. No? Alright. I'll show you. I'm not feeling good about doing this. There's nothing to worry about. You're safe. I can't hurt you this way. Paolo! It's happening! Come here! Come here! Holy shit! Keep your hands away from my mouth! Djuna? Oh god. Do you believe me now? Look at me. No! No. No. Let's make love. Are you scared? No. This is what had to happen. I would have done anything to be with you...However insane. I know. It's all insane. And I know in my heart, it would have been wrong to let you go. For both of us. My world belongs to you now. I will teach you everything I know. Very closely knit. Xenia, the actress who owns this house, for example... She designed it for needs like ours. Little things, but very important. And irene, the housekeeper... She's got a rare blood disorder, so she's not a Temptation for us. Her mother had it too, so she's very highly valued. Extremely loyal. She looks after the house. Keeps watch during the day. You'll start to feel a pressure in your lower back... And that will turn into a hunger... And that hunger will grow until you feed it. And if you don't feed, that hunger will turn into pain. You can't let it get to that, or you'll be out of control. Will we live forever? Chances are, we will. But there are ways to die. Sunlight. Fire. But we won't get older, and we won't get sick. And if we get hurt, we heal almost right away. It's a different reality. But I know we can have a normal life. You and me. Forever. Not here. Not yet. Come. Let's go home. So you can write those screenplays you're So crazy about. Are you trying to tell me something? No, I'm trying to tell you that maybe it's time to get your Things and move in. You got it all? Yeah. I'm happy. I'm really happy, Paolo. I made you coq au vin. It smells incredible. It turned out perfectly. Can I say something? Of course. I just want to get it over with. Ok. It feels weird that it was so natural. That it didn't bother me more. I was surprised that I knew what to do. And feel how I've changed. Even my vision. What I see. I can't believe how much I was missing before. Everything just feels so... Heightened. Heightened. What are you doing here? Nice to see you, too, djuna. I'm staying here for a week while my new place gets set up. Well, call her if you want. Hi, I'm mimi. Djuna's sister. It's really not a good idea for you to stay here. Where am I supposed to go, djuna? To a hotel? I'm only going to be here a week. It's not like I'm going to hang around you anyway. Don't worry. You look great. What's your secret? Dog blood? I take it the two of you don't get along. No she's... What? She's a disturbed creature. Where are you coming from? Amsterdam. Amsterdam? It was horrible. The group I was living with was crazy. I couldn't take it anymore. You couldn't take it, or they couldn't take it? How long were you there? Five years. It was fun at first. It's a great city, but my roommates ruined it for me. People were catching on to us. I started to be afraid to go to bed. I thought I was going to be torched by a church Group or something. So? What's in phoenix? Where will you live there? On a ranch. It's like a commune. You make night blooming gardens, pottery. You study latin literature. Basically, it's rehab. Xenia thinks that's what I need to do, So I'm gonna try it. I guess I don't really have a choice, do I? Cheers. That wasn't so bad. She's a crazy freak, you'll see. She didn't sound crazy. She seemed pretty cohesive. Crazy's not the word. She's not out of touch with reality. She's sick. It's only a week. The clock is already ticking. She'll be gone soon. I had a nightmare. We were at the ballet school. We were hiding in the closet and she was trying to find us. I wonder if she's still teaching. Maybe someone got her. Damn vampire solidarity. I'm sure they moved her... Somewhere. I had a dream, too, about mom. I can't remember her face anymore. Can you? Not really. It's gone. Nothing's left. Wow! Look at them. That looks so fun, doesn't it? It's interesting to see you with a man. It's been a long time since... What was his name? Henry? What was that? Sixty, seventy years ago? A long time ago. I forget. Did you turn him or not? You know I didn't. Yeah, that's right. You wouldn't do that to someone. Well, what made you turn this one? The loneliness got to you? I've been alone a long time. It wasn't that. It was just going to happen with him. What does that mean? It means I love him. Love him? I just want to say, for the last century, You've judged me so harshly. And it's just strange that now you turn someone you Claim to love. At least I've never done that. I've never bit someone I love, djuna! I wouldn't do that. You're not capable of loving. You wouldn't know. I just know it's not an option. I'm not the sick one. Don't romanticize stupid humans, and watch them through goggles No, you just leave a trail of shit wherever you go and get Off on it! Speaking of getting off, maybe you finally have... Because suddenly, you don't mind sentencing To the shit we have to deal with. You know what you did was wrong. Admit it! Don't fucking judge me anymore! Hi, xenia, it's djuna. How is everything at the house? Well, it's not good. It's about mimi. You know she's here? Yes, she needed a place to stay. I've arranged a safe house for her in phoenix, But it won't be ready for a week. Well, I'm worried. She's not stable, you know she's not. Darling, she wants to change her life, And I can't turn my back on that. She's a monster. You're sisters. And the fact that she's crowding in on this love Affair you're having... I was going to tell you about him. Paolo. Darling, I trust your judgment... But if you can just bear with mimi for a week. Of course. Thank you. Thank you. So, I want to tell you something. I have some money and... I'd like to get us a house. I was thinking we'd go somewhere out of the country. Someplace new, where we could start again. Yeah? Yeah. Just give me a minute. I'll take care of everything. I've never lived with anyone before. Good. I think I'm afraid.  I feel so exposed.  I can hear myself.  Hey! Hey, wait. I was gonna offer to buy you a drink. Thirsty? Come here. Sure you don't want to come back inside? I'd rather be here. Ok, well... Let me know if you change your mind about that drink. Come here and kiss me. Adam! Yo! Come on. Taking forever... You know you don't have to do that, don't you? Djuna is completely neurotic. The possum was dead. Everyone knows that about animals. If it makes her feel better, it's fine by me. So, tell me Paolo. There are really guys like you out there... Who want to have the life sucked out of them? Go fuck yourself! Do you think those guys have problems? Maybe aren't mentally healthy? I would say, wouldn't you? Why the fuck are you so interested? I don't know. Maybe I'd like a guy like that for me. Good-looking. Destructive. Oh yeah. But you're not destructive. This is all about love. Tough guy, huh? Djuna? Come over. Beautiful. Ciao. It's going to be fun. Everyone there will be like us. It'll be good for you to meet them. It's important. Djuna! Paolo. It is so nice to meet you. Djuna's told me wonderful things about you. I've heard so many wonderful things about you as well. You have a beautiful apartment, and a beautiful Home, of course. Thank you for letting me stay there. It is my absolute pleasure, Paolo. I've seen some of your films. No, you are! You're a very talented writer. One day you have to write a part for me. Anytime. It would be my honor. Omar, come meet my very dear friends. Djuna and Paolo. How nice to meet you. Hello. Lydia and omar came from rome for my opening. You should see their place. They may have the most exquisite taste I've ever seen. We were just talking about going to rome. Maybe even moving there. Oh, you should. It's one of the best cities for us. Large community. Perfect for lovers. Are you new? No, not at all. Both of you are beautiful. The first 100 years are insufferable, But they do get easier. The previews start Saturday... Night, of course. Obviously, I don't do matinees. And why should you? Good to meet you! Nice to meet you as well. So, they tell me that you're new. Yes, I'm sure there's still quite a bit to learn. Ah, there is, there is indeed. You're in excellent hands. Djuna's a treasure. So you're staying up at Xenia's place in connecticut? We are. I love that place. A little amuse-bouche, everyone? Oh, don't worry, it's not human. I don't know, but whatever it is, it's kosher. Xenia doesn't mess around. Whatever this is, it is the beluga of Politically-correct plasma. Bottoms up! Yeah. He's extraordinary. He would make a great actor because he's so full of pain. Pain? Not the bad kind. No, not pain. Let' say, awareness. Soul. He's extraordinary. My darling! So happy to see you! Cheers. I have a few cases of this synthetic blood for each of you. Try not to go through it too quickly. I don't know how long this army connection will last. Or how long we'll have access. The fda hasn't approved it. Even if the fda approves... It's not that we'll be able to get it any more consistently. It's not like we can exactly lobby for why... Prescriptions for us would be a good idea for the mainstream. Of course not. And if they knew we did, I highly highly doubt... That they'd deal with it by selling us synthetic blood. It makes me so mad! The way we're forced to live. I mean this isn't their world, it's our world! They're just passing through. It's not our world. We may never die, but collectively, Well, we're the ones forced to hide. We are the monsters. I can't abide any more of this self-loathing. We know what the situation is. We discuss it all the time. We're at the beginning of creating a civilization For ourselves. Just like they did when they realized that... Killing and raping on a regular basis was not a fulfilling Way to live. I don't want to hear the term "monsters." We're all monsters. Potentially, you know, potentially not. Yes, but one has to ask oneself... Does the existence of dr. Jekyll make mr. Hyde any less Of a monster? I think that the point we all have come to realize, Hans...Is that what civilization is is a set of moral laws.... And if those laws are broken, there will be punishment. Humans still break them... But for the most part... These laws have forced them to value humanity... To develop sensitivity... Which is just as real in them as their baser impulses. I mean, those laws... Have freed them to experience their little lives... The way we haven't been able to. I don't like them. I don't find them touching, the way you seem to. I don't find you touching. They are the best audiences, I can tell you that. Vampires are notorious for "golf applause". Xenia, jesus. The ultimate barometer for superior race, According to xenia... How adoring is the audience? Yes. Where did mimi go? She's home. What the fuck is she doing? What is she listening to? I kind of like it. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt. You must leave! Who the hell do you think you are? Who is she? I'm Mimi's sister. You should know that mimi has a serious medical condition.. And should not be engaging in any irresponsible encounters. I do not have a medical condition. She most certainly does. Please wait outside. I'll call you a taxi, and leave you money to get home. Please go! Oh my god! It's alright. Oh my god! Oh my god! What did we almost get ourselves into? Do you think we're gonna be ok? Yeah, we're ok. I want to get out of here, ok? What's going on? Your girlfriend thinks she's the lady of the house. She thinks she can just come in here and kick my guests out. She thinks she can have friends here, But I can't. Friends? Really? It's not going to go anywhere like this. Did it turn you on? What? What? How long has it been? I don't know. Not that long. This is such a fucking nightmare. I can't wait to be back in our apartment. We're not kids anymore, this was so stupid of us. The only thing that we did that was stupid was get In someone's car... And drive 1 outside the city. Other than that, we didn't do anything wrong. I don't know. I can't help but think we brought this on ourselves, You know? Please! Who are you right now? I love you, jack. I never said that you didn't. I love you too, now just stop acting like a child. What's that? Did you hear that noise? Just an animal. Just stay here. No jack, don't go over there! Jack, don't. Don't go over there! Please! Jack, don't! Shit! Jack! You call for a cab? Where are they? Probably at the clinic, getting tests. I told you, you don't listen! You keep coming back into my life, Over and over again. Destroying everything! Why can't I be free of you? Why? Xenia would ex-communicate you, if she knew. Stay away from me! Don't interfere with my life! You'll be away soon enough! Let me over, prick! Hey, Paolo, what's going on? What are you doing man? You haven't returned any of my texts or anything. I'm on my way up to the house, 'cause... I'm a little concerned, man. It's not like you. It's like you dropped off the planet. Anyway, I'll be there in like 20 minutes. That's it. I'll see you soon. Alright, buddy? Alright, I'll talk to you later. Well then don't fucking put your fucking blinker on! Good, what can I get for you? Can I get a vodka-soda, please. Hey... Have you seen a new guy hanging around here? Dark-haired, good-looking guy? Drinks scotch? Yeah, I've seen him in here, why? I'm his agent. I'm ben rider. I've been trying to get ahold of him... I went by the house I put him up in and... Nothing, looks like no one's living there. Yeah well, I heard he's been staying out with a girl On hansen road. I wouldn't be too worried about him though. He's having quite the affair. Is that right? Yeah. So what's your deal? You an actress? You like the way it feels to hunt, no? I like a lot of things. I don't need that. Me neither. Son of a bitch! Paolo! Paolo? Oh, it's my fucking agent. Ben. Hey. Jesus, it's hard to find you up here. How are you? I'm good. Good to see you. It's good to see you too. Djuna, this is my agent, ben rider. Hi. So you're the one who stole my client away from me? Look at you, you're gorgeous. Are you an actress? Well you should be. Come on in. Oh, my goodness, this is fucking crazy! You haven't been writing shit, have you? I have. Oh, you're full of shit. I have. I just printed out some stuff. I'll show you. Dude, if you could parlay what you're doing here out there, You're going to be huge. Read it and then we'll have dinner. This is all new stuff? Djuna, this is incredible. I took a chance on coming out here and I got The royal treatment. And this house is ridiculous. I mean this is crazy time up here. You gotta remember to send me that information on Your friend's play. I wanna see that, so you gotta e-mail me the information. I know it's not broadway, but I really want to check it out. I will. I'm really happy to be here. Hey pal, I gotta tell you, I can't stop thinking about those Pages I read. They're great, man. Do you feel good about that? Yeah. Do you? Oh come on, man, the action sequences are unbelievable. It's the best stuff you've ever written. The studio's going to go crazy. Do you know this guy used to be impossible to deal with? He would write all this artsy-fartsy crap that I Couldn't get any investors for? Used to think he was better than everyone else. I didn't think I was better than everyone else. I just didn't understand why people didn't expect more Out of life. Yeah, well we thought the same about you. He used to drive this artsy car, that didn't even drive. It wasn't arty, it was a peugeot. Fucking peugeot! A peugeot! He used to think he was jean-luc truffaut, With this silly hat... Smoking cigarettes and dirty fingernails. Look p... You've joined the human race, and we're glad to have you. It's a good thing. You look good. It's nice to meet you. I didn't realize you had teeth before. Hey... To embracing life. Cheers. And all its flaws. And all its warts, alright? I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Woah! Are you alright? Yeah, I had a drinks meeting before I... You want some coffee? Excuse me. Do you think I could just crash here tonight... Instead of driving into the city? 'cause I... We... We work all night, ben, and we sleep pretty late. No, I'll be up early in the morning. I have a breakfast meeting. No, of course. Of course you can stay. You shouldn't drive like this. Sometimes you get speedy, you know? Paolo? Get the fuck away from me! Xenia, do you have a minute? I have to tell you, bad things are happening. It's about mimi. She's completely out of control. She's endangering all of us. She's been out every night hunting humans, Leaving them to resurrect. How do you know this? I just know. You just know? She swears to me she's not, djuna. Unless you have proof, I have no reason not to believe her. Now xenia, she's bringing it into the house. The other night she brought a couple over here. If I hadn't come... What was happening? The three of them were in a sexual situation. They were starting - Djuna, don't be so puritanical. When I first gave up my old life, No one believed I was clean. Whatever I did was proof to others that I was still sick. I know it's hard to have faith in her... But I know where she's coming from. I've been there. Darling, my play is opening tomorrow night. Please, put your differences aside. In a few days, she'll be gone. Djuna. What do you think? I loved it tonight. It was beyond words. Neither of us can hardly speak. You were magnificent. Your performance, djuna is right, Was beyond words. Give me more. I must have words. I mean, many words, after you digest Ms. Tomassini, prof. Ching would like a word with you. You're coming to dinner? Yeah, of course. Please do. I love you. Hello. How are you? Wasn't that amazing? I need to get some air. Excuse me. Always so naughty. Sorry to make you leave. Don't worry. Check out this loon. My god! Xenia! Xenia! Folks, I told you twenty times, no autographs. I need everyone to the side! You're a fan of ms. Tomassini? What? You should meet her some time. I'm sure she'd like to meet a fan as devoted as you Seem to be. Meet her? Give me your number. Mimi! Andiamo, for Christ's sake! How old are you? Seventeen. Hmm. Lovely age. What are you doing? She's not leaving. So then we'll leave sooner. Either way, you've got to stop doing this to yourself. Why don't we get out of the house for a while? Huh? Go down the hill, take a drive. Clear your head. If a part of you didn't want me, I could have never Made this work. Pack. We're leaving tomorrow night, early. We're gonna go to Italy. Stay with the couple from Cenia's party till our House is ready. Xenia arranged for a private plane. Everything. It's all happening. Pack. She's expecting us, right? She's expecting me. I told her I was in the neighborhood and I'd drop by. She doesn't know you've brought me? Do you think she'll be upset? She'll be delighted. Hello xenia.... I've brought someone. Her name is ann... Hello, ann. Hello, ms. Tomassini. May we come in? Please. May I offer you something to drink? A glass of champagne, thank you. So, how do you two know each other? Ann is your biggest fan. So our paths crossed. How have the shows been going? Wonderful. It's... A wonderful situation. It's a wonderful play. It's beyond wonderful. Mimi, may I talk to you for a moment? Yes, of course. You can't bring a virgin into my home. A virgin! You're around all sorts of people all the time. I really didn't think twice. I thought you'd be fine with it. Not to have alone in my home. With the windows closed! In my drawing room staring at me like some sacrifice! You've got to get her out! I'm sorry, xenia, I didn't think. I haven't tasted human blood for 40 years. It's almost a hundred years I haven't tasted a virgin! It's harder. You have to prepare for these things... To know your limits, what you can bear and... What you can't. This is not acceptable! I understand. Finish your glass of champagne and say you have to go. May I please have a glass of water? Of course. I'll get it. You're so beautiful. Even more beautiful without make-up. Oh, well, thank you darling. That's very sweet. And what do you do? I'm a student. Of course. Of course, you are. I first saw you in medea. It changed my life. I don't mean to be strange... But I have always felt that we were destined to meet. When mimi picked me out of the crowd the other night... And asked me if I'd want to meet you... I was surprised, of course I was. But part of me wasn't. Drink your water, ann. We have to be going soon. Oh no! Did you cut your lip on the glass? There must have been a chip. Crystal chips so easily. Are you alright? Yeah. It's fine. I have another appointment. Don't leave yet. You can't leave, bleeding like that. Perhaps ann can stay until her bleeding stops. Yes. But I have to go myself. Stay until it stops. It is destiny. Good-bye, xenia. Are you sure you don't want me to take her? No... We'll have a glass of champagne and a nice talk. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. No one knows and no one has to know. I know how it is. I can help you take care of this. If you have a saw, I can do it in the bathtub. I'm happy to help. But there is something we need to talk about. I can't go to phoenix, xenia. I'm all packed. Before you get on that plane with me, And we do this... There's something I need to tell you. What is it? I could stay in the estate for now. But what I'd really like to do is have a place here In the city. Do you think you could arrange that for me, xenia? You're the best. There's something I need to tell you as well. Yeah? Your agent... She did? No. She didn't. It was me. That one was me. Putain! Are you the maid? Thank god... Help me... Help me inside! Help me! Help me! I will, madame. Have a wonderful performance. Are you ready? Yes. Thank you, irene. My pleasure, madame. I think we've got everything. Thank you, irene. Thank you so much for everything. I hope we'll meet again soon. Thank you for taking care of us.
