## Film Script Analysis Application
These are the files for the Project proposal at the Data Incubator, they consiste of:
- [Main Section](https://github.com/luisecastro/dataInc/blob/master/project.ipynb): Jupyter notebook, contains the code used explained step by step. It is the source for the development of the app. 
    - Webcrawling
    - Watson API

    - Summarization
    - Recommendation
    - Genre classification

- [Film Script Analyzer](https://github.com/luisecastro/dataInc/blob/master/film_script_analyzer.pdf): An early proposal for the project.

- [rs.py](https://github.com/luisecastro/dataInc/blob/master/rs.py): Function for specific plots.
- [Data Mining](https://github.com/luisecastro/dataInc/blob/master/stuff/data_mining.ipynb) Data mining section sent as part of the proposal for the semifinal.
- [Prediction](https://github.com/luisecastro/dataInc/blob/master/stuff/prediction.ipynb) Supervised learning section sent as part of the proposal for the semifinal.

Additionaly there are 5 folders:
- data: contains the current dataset used, along json files from the api's.
- data_old: previous (smaller) datasets.
- scrapped: the raw texts of the scripts.
- scrapped_old: previous scripts.
- stuff: testing and prototyping code.
