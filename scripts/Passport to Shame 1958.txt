I'll get that deposit by Monday, I've made up my mind. Yeah and I'm gonna be queen of the May. I'll get it... no matter what it costs, what it is I'm gonna get it. Mike, I'm gonna get it. 185, 190, 200, correct? Thank you very much Mr... Hadril, yes yes. By Monday she'll be all mine. You should see her, she's a beauty. Anyone'd think it was a pretty girl. More important than a pretty girl for the moment. I don't think you quite understand. This is a taxi, it's the beginning of a... a whole fleet of taxis. I don't know, maybe 5 years from now... Repayments on the first of the month, alright? Oh sure. Thank you very much Mr Hadril. And listen, if you want a free ride you know where to get me. United Loan Company Who? Oh yes How long? Alright. He's only a kid mister and he's sick. I'm sorry, no security, no loan. But I've absolutely no security. Don't worry about security, your signature is perfectly good I assure you, as long as we can help you. It's terribly kind of you, I been so worried. You look quite happy now. Thank you. Paris called. There's a 5 minute delay on the line but they might come through sooner. She looked a good prospect. She'll never be able to pay. Anything from Vienna? No, but Zurich have got two girls for us and there's still Paris. United Loan Company. Oh yes, hold on a moment. Your Paris call. Hello Aggie, how's tricks? You have? Good. Yes. Yes. Hold on a second. Paris have a girl for us. Got a husband ready? Cab driver, just been in here. Dead broke. What's she like? Here name's Malou. I think you'll agree with me. We're fixing it now. Malou, watch the till for a moment? 31,740 ok. Yes. May I have another coffee please. Did you get throught to London alright? Yes thank you. You we're very lucky. Sometimes it's very difficult to hear. I would never make a call from here. It's too noisy. This was business that couldn't wait. I hope it was successful. Very. Malou. Yes. I left for a second and 5,000 francs is missing. What do you mean? Where's the money? I didn't take any money. And what's this? 1, 2, 3, 4... 5,000 francs. I didn't take any money. You little thief. I'm calling the police. No, please don't. He says I took money from him. Oh nonsense. You didn't touch a penny. Don't shout at me you... foreigner. What's the French word for liar? Menteur. Vous menteur. Alright how much, how much, how much are you short? Combien? Well come on, combien? Don't you understand French? Cinq milles francs madam. 5000 francs, but don't madam, I didn't take any. A donnez-moi... What the hell's the word for change? The money yes, and quick, vite vite. You shouldn't madam, I didn't. Get your things dear. You're coming with me. I don't understand a word you're talking about and perhaps it's just as well. Ready dear? Hey it's Johnny. So he did get his new car. He's like a kid with a new toy. Hey watch out, this man's crazy. Poor Johnny, it's your new cab. Disgraceful. I saw the whole thing. Did you get the number? No i'm afraid not. I could give a description of the lorry to the police and they might... Alot of good that'll do. Well, it's better than nothing. I don't think we should let these people get away with this kind of thing. Come, let me give you my name and address. Let's slip in there. I had her three days. Three days. Well here's my name and one of my addresses. Hey, what regiment were you with during the war? Canadian highlanders. Canadian. Marines me. Do you remember Dieppe? The only thing I can remember is the money I owe. These money lenders, who are they? United loan company. United loan, oh yes. I know them, off Dean Street. Yes well, maybe I can help you. You come there tomorrow at noon. Don't forget, at noon. You don't even know me. At Dieppe one of you mob pulled me off the beach and saved my life. Cost him half his leg. I didn't know him either. Your property now, sir. Goodbye. Goodbye. You know i'm fixed. Gonna be a long time before I can pay that back. Have that one on Dieppe. Where's that... Nick, we still have a couple of rooms empty next door. I filled them, two girls from Zurich. Where's that French girl? Paris is getting her a passport. It takes a day or two so I came on ahead. She should be here tomorrow to start her new job. What job? Companion to a nice, kind English lady. You? Me. You're going to keep her here? Of course. I tell you Nick, she's a special. Alright. Don't wear that dress when you meet her. You look like a... Like... a what, Nick? Wear those tailored suits I had made for you. What's the matter? Saville Row. Natty tie, elegant shoes, Eton hat... and an umbrella. Quite the gentleman. What's wrong with that? You're still just a kid from the East End Nick. Fortune telling. I'll have a car meet that French girl. Did you say East End? Don't you ever bring that up again. Or I will kill you. What did he want? Oh nothing. Finish reading the cards. Next door's buzzing like a beehive. The girls are busting the... Let them bust. Now come on. Where were we? A letter, and some money. Nick never gives money away. I wasn't talking about Nick. I was just telling you what the cards say. What does it say about getting married? Well, there's a middle-aged fair man. I wonder could it be this one. Widower, 53, steady job, own home... seeks companionable lady of refined taste with a view to marriage. Well? What's the joke? You and your respectable prospects. You've been reading those matrimonial journals for 2 years now. You'll never leave Nick. I want to, the way he acts now. And I will too, if the right man comes along. Well the cards say you're not getting married until... The cards. You don't know how to read them anyway. Won't get married til when? When do the cards say? Aggie, I need a new bed for my sister Maria. She can't sleep properly on that one. We haven't got any beds. Besides, your sister isn't one of the working girls. What about the bed in there? It's booked. Now come on, when do the cards say? When? Do I get that bed for Maria? Vicky, read the cards. Oh very well. Take the bed from room 43. That one's reserved for a new girl. A special. Here, they're all yours. My... niece won't need them now. But I can't. Come on, take your things off. Especially that mac. And you won't need that hat. Is that your best frock? It's my only one. Try this. It's beautiful. It should fit you. Damn, now I have to fix this stocking. You know I bet this new girl doesn't have to mend her own clothes. Oh stop moaning. You do alright don't you? Come along my dear. I'll help you into it. Anyone at home? You know Nick, for a moment you looked like a customer. Cut it out. -You took the words right out of my mouth. Now remember this girl's valuable property. She's not going to be easy to handle. How do you know? Experience... and instinct. A woman is like a guitar, it depends on the player. And you're a maestro. Now this first thing we've got to do is to get a husband. I've got one. And so I told the old lady exactly what my lawyer told me... the only thing to do is to get the girl married off to a British subject. Then she won't need a labour permit and all her troubles will be over. But of course, I haven't got an eligible bachelor handy. Except you. I can't afford to keep a taxi, never mind a wife! Ah well, you know best. Of course all you'd have to do is to go through the ceremony. Afterwards we get the marriage annuled. You know, for non-consumation. Two minutes and it's all over. The old lady, she's so keen to keep that girl as her companion... she'd give you 200 and think of you as doing her a favour. Course you'd have your own cab again. And you'd be doing me a favour too. Favour, every time I meet you I'm making money. Look, here is my lawyer's card. Go and see him. I'm sure he can fix up something. Good evening Mr Biaggi. Hello. I'll marry her for half the price, how about that? You know the girl I was talking about... she's pretty too. Vicky, I want you to... Good looker isn't she? So was my sister once. That was Nick. I'd nothing to do with it. You know that don't you? She's talking about suicide again... Vicky I've got to go out for a few minutes, keep your eye on Malou will you. Why me? Because you're the only one Nick will allow in the other house. And don't forget, shut the connecting door after you. Oh, hello. Hello. I'm Vicky. Are you a friend of Ms Agatha? Yeah. What have you got there? I just saved it from breaking his neck. You know, you remind me of someone. I shall call him 'Mignon'. Means cute. Mignon. Mignon. Mignon. Mignon. Have you known Ms Agatha long? Aggie? Long enough. You like it here? Oh I love it. Never had such a job. You can believe that. Drink? No thank you. Do you think she'll let me keep it? I don't see why not. We've all gotta have something in this life. Yes, a decent job. And I've got one here. What do you work at? Nothing. Don't you work at all? Oh yes, i'm in the entertainment business. Really, what do you do? Entertain. No I mean, what sort of... Oh don't ask so many damn questions you worse than a kid. Look, don't take any notice of me. I'm like that at times. It's alright. You know you do look like her. Like she was. Who? My kid sister. Malou darling, I want you to meet my business adviser and good friend, Nick Biaggi. How do you do? Better as a friend than a business adviser i'm afraid. Hello Vicky, what an unexpected pleasure. Well now I've been trying to get you a working permit. There isn't any difficulty is there? I'm afraid there is. A very serious one. The official quota has run out and no more permits are being issued until next year. But what am I going to do? There isn't anything she can do except go back to France. I can't! The police. Oh miss Agatha. I won't leave you, I won't. Isn't there any way? I've consulted four solicitors and only one of them an any sort of suggestion at all. But that i'm afraid was quite crazy. What was it? Oh it's not worth talking about I assure you. May I help myself to a drink? Would you care for one? - No thanks But what was it? Well he said the only thing would be one of those one-day marriages. You marry a British subject and then have the marriage annulled. Oh, you mean a 'Mariage blanc'? Pardon? You never see the man after the ceremony. Many French girls did that after the war to get to America. It's not so terrible is it? But where should we find a husband? And you think he's giving you 200 quid as a favour? You actually believe this malarkey? Pass me the wrench. You can read it in all the papers. How they bring these girls over just to get them British passports. So that they can't be deported when they put them out on the streets. Well don't you ever read the papers? Yeah I read the papers. Must be a blocked fuel pipe. Do you want to press the starter? You don't even know what his name is. Nick. Nick what? Nick Biaggi. Biaggi, don't you know who he is? Why he's the biggest pro... Look Johnny face up to it will ya. Suppose... suppose... Johnny I'm trying to say something to ya. Look suppose it's a tart he's brought over. I don't care who he's bringing over. He's my friend. Look Johhny, suppose it's an innocent girl he's brought over. What are you trying to make out of me, a boy scout? All my chances got smashed like the cab got smashed. That's life... It get rough sometimes. Oh you're gonna start telling me what life's about? Rough... It's a glorified rat race. And I'm gonna start running til I get out front with all the smart guys. And I don't care how rough it gets. Mike. The Sundown Club, Curzon Street, Mr Sanderson. I think he's had quite a few. Ok. Think about it Johnny. Hello gorgeous. Got a hot tip for you Try How's ya father in the 3.30. Best horse of the day in all. Is he in? Sammy White's waiting and so's Nick's taxi driver. When the girl arrives i'll see her and the taxi driver together. Send Sammy White in. Will you come in please Mr White. Well Mr White, what sort of perjury can we commit for you today? Well all I can tell you... Mr Heath? -Oh he won't keep you long. Will you take a seat. Thank you. Nice day isn't it? Yes. You wouldn't be... no you couldn't be. I beg your pardon. Nothing, nothing. Go ahead. Would you care for a cigarette? No thank you. You're from the continent aren't you? -Yes, France. France, wonderful country. Have you been there? Yeah, once during the war. We did a raid on the Brittany coast. At dawn. Very beautiful. Sand dunes and the pines coming out of the mist. Do you know you could practically smell the pines as you were getting closer. Then the spandaus opened up. They were hidden in the pines. Killers. My brother was killed in the war. What part of France do you come from? Paris. Ah Paris. Is it really as gay as everybody says? Not when you're hungry or frightened. Have you seen any of the English countryside? You should, it's beautiful, real beautiful. Beautiful as... oh well. This waiting around just drives me mad. What are you here for? Oh, just some legal business. And you? Well, yeah, that's what i'm here for, legal business too. Don't worry about a thing Mr White. Ah Ms Beaucaire, oh & Mr McVey too. The bride and the groom have met. It's quite simple really, we defray all incidental expenses, even the ring. Try this. Try this. Oh it seems a bit loose. Oh it'll do. Is there anything else you want to know about? No, I don't think so. The perfect marriage. One day only. You want that cigarette now? Thank you. Been in this racket a long time? Racket? Game, business. Whatever you call it. What? Don't act stupid. Don't you be rude. Do you think I enjoy doing this? What are you doing it for? And what are you doing it for? For the money honey. I do it for my job. It's the first decent job i've had. Decent. Yes decent. Good food, good clothes and no worries. And the woman I work for is kind. Woman? What about Nick Biaggi? He's just a friend of hers. And when he knew I had to have British passport... he said there were plenty of men who'd marry a girl out of price. He was right there wasn't he? I don't know why I feel miserable. Not bad. That's not yours. It is now. A souvenir of my beloved wife. Why are you like that? What have I done? Oh nothing. Want it back? It doesn't matter. It's funny... my mother used to say "Marriage is forever". Coming? I think I prefer the fresh air. I need it more than you do dear. Repeat after me... I call upon these persons here present to witness that I Jonathan McVey... I call upon these persons here present to witness that I Jonathan McVey...

Bride and grrom first and then the witnesses. The first installment. What am I supposed to say, congratulations? Well you got the money anyway. I wonder what it's going to cost that girl. -Shut up! You saw what happened. It's all legit and above board. You saw the woman she worked for... That old bag, she was on the beat 10 years ago. You're crazy. Look, who are you trying to convince Johnny, me or you? Listen, if anything ever happened to that girl... Kind of a nice face though didn't she? Nice face. Come on, we're on call in 10 minutes. Well well, here comes the bride. Poor Mignon, she must be hungry. Go on, it's time you went to work. So soon after a wedding? Have a heart. I have and it's made of gold. Go and dig for it. Little pig, no wonder you're getting fat. It was nice though. You know. I wouldn't have minded if it would have been a real marriage. You think i'm crazy. Well what do you know about love? You don't know anything. Hey where are you going? Mignon, Mignon come here. Mignon, Mignon, Mignon. Mignon. Mignon. Mignon please don't be naughty. Mignon where are you? Mignon come come. What was that? Funny, I thought I heard something. Hello, yes, just a moment. For you sir. Hello, Aggie, how's tricks? What? I told you never to leave her alone. Stay there. Yes Nick, yes Nick I will. I'll be over. But you see I... Oh... Mal... Malou. Malou my dear. Oh but Malou. Don't touch me. But Malou what is it? What's upset you? Calm down. Now Malou listen to me. Let get off me. Mignon come. Listen you stupid little... Nick wants to give you everything. You're lucky, you could have it easy, I didn't. She hit me. She hit me. It's alright. Let the boys do it. Put her on the sofa. Get out, you too. I know what you want me for. I know what you're business is. I won't do it! You don't know anything. Yet. You can't keep me here. Look don't make a scene. I don't like scenes. And I don't like violence so let's... You know what I did for some of the girls who used to work for me? I picked them out of the gutter and I gave them their chance. I suppose you thought I was going to put you in the streets with all the others. Nonsense, no, not you. You are going to the best places with the best people. And you know what? No man is going to touch you. Not for 3 months, 6 months, maybe longer. But then it's going to be the right one. A top client. An ambassador, a visiting diplomat... a cabinet minister, the cream. I'm going to take you out of the gutter and put you in the international set. You'll be big, you'll be somebody, bigger than me. And in 5 years from now... we'll make a fortune. That's what i'll do for you. If you play the cards the way I deal them. You'll be reserved for special customers and for me. You know what you are? You're a mug, suck. You've could had it easy all fo your life. No. Johnny. Who? Johnny. Johnny? That low-life cab driver, you turn me down for him you fool? You could've been my girl. Come in. Take her next door. Room 43. What are you going to do with her? I'll teach her. Turning me down for a cab driver. Is he in? Why yes but... Ah, unexpected but welcome. I've got these papers... Where is she? Who? The one I married. I've no idea. No look, just out you're signature there... Where is she? If it's a question of money, and it generally is, i'll try and get it for you. Where is she? You spilt me milk. I'll break your neck. I've told you, I don't know. Where's Nick Biaggi? Nick? Yeah, I want his address, otherwise I'm gonna make a lot of noise. That's all you want? June, get Nick on the telephone quick. Nick... he's here. The cab driver's causing trouble. He wants to see the girl. He demanded your address. No, I sent him to Grant Street. That's the whole story. Here's a snapshot of her. And the man behind all this is Nick Biaggi. Why don't you call in the police? Don't be daft. What've we got on him? We don't even know if she's working for him yet. And the police'll be asking Johnny some fuuny questions about... marrying a French girl just to get a passport. Alright, she's our business. Hey boys? Sooner or later she's gonna wind up on the streets like all the Biaggi girls. And that's our chance. Now you all know what she looks like? The minute you spot her telephone Miriam, she knows what to do. And what are you going to do? I'm going to do the rest. I've told all the other boys so everyone's primed. Take Park Lane, Oxford Street, Shaftsbury Avenue, Piccadilly... is a rough square, she's bound to be in it. It's up to you and them and luck. Don't worry Johnny, I'll be praying for you. First call Bond Street. Hello dearie. Sorry, wrong face. I'm hungry, give me something, anything. If you want food you got to work for it. No. I gave you your chance. You could've been... I go the police, I'll go back to France. You are wanted by the police in France for the cafe job. Remember? We framed you. Get Maria. I won't do it. I don't care if you kill me. I won't, I won't. Have a look at her face. No, no. See what a few drops of acid can do? Maria too was a girl who wouldn't look at a man. Now no man will look at her. What's this? You killed that man. I couldn't have, I couldn't have killed a man. The pictures prove you did. No, no. You did my dear. They're fake, They're fake. You try and convince somebody else of that. And now? Put her on the streets. What? Nick, you're crazy. She'll go straight to... It's alright, her first customer will be one of the boys. Try and pull yourself together. It's the only way. You must try. Malou. Go on. For your own sake, try. I can't. Don't think about it, just do it. Malou, they're watching you. I don't care if they kill me. They'll do worse than that you little fool. Don't you realise? You saw Maria didn't you? You saw what they did to her. My kid sister. The one that used to look like you. Blue 47, are you reading? For crying out loud, Blue 47. Mike's found her. Bayswater road near Flanders place. Ok Miriam. Assistance Bayswater Road, Johnny's on his way. There may be trouble. Everybody near stand by. Do you really think there'll be trouble? Are you kidding? With Mike there he'd sooner fight than have his breakfast. I think i'm ill. That's the stuff they gave you. It'll wear off. Go on. Alright sweetie. No. No. Get the girl away Johnny. Leave this lot to me. Well come on never mind about him, they're getting the girl away. Well come on, get after them, scarper. Are you alright? Yeah I'm alright. It's you again. Come on, get up. They're coming closer. And then they said the French police want me for stealing... But they framed me, I didn't steal anything Johnny. And... And when I refused to... you know what. Nick beat me. And then he gave me something, a cigarette or something... and when I came to, they said I killed a man. I don't know Johnny, I don't know. You didn't kill anyone. That was a frame up too. Oh maybe it's all lies. I don't know but... I just feel lost. I'm gonna make you some coffee. You know there are 72 ways of making coffee? That's what some guy told me. I frankly think he was kidding me. Johnny you don't understand. They wanted me to... Look. Real cream, top of the milk. I always save it for coffee. Oh Johnny you... Stop, you're with me, you're alright. Nothing to worry about. I don't want to cause you any more trouble. Well, didn't you're mother say that marriage was forever? Drink your coffee and shut up. But you just can't accept me as a wife like... like that. No? Look, you've been very kind I understand. But this was business arrangement. You had no choice. From the moment I set eyes on you I had no choice. But it isn't fair to you, listen Johnny I... Malou, I think that's very good coffee. And you know... I've got a spare room that my mother uses when she comes to town. You have a mother? What type of a crack is that? Doesn't everyone? Don't look at me like that. I can't explain these things. You know when I, I went to the fights... and I'd 5 pounds in my pocket and my fare home. And there was a skinny little bantam- weight of a kid climbing into the ring. He was the skinniest little thing you ever saw. And I was sitting close to him and he looked down at me... and gave me a funny little smile. And suddenly I got that feeling. I took those 5 pounds out my pocket, gave it to the bookmaker... and I pointed to the kid. I didn't even know his name. And all the while this kid was watching me. Brother when he came out of that ring, when that bell sounded... He was in there right, left, left, right. Either you belive or you don't believe. That's French, that sounds pretty. What does it mean? The heart has reasons that reason doesn't understand. Let's not try to understand. It's a beautiful night. It's raining. I feel good. So do I. You look good too. You look a little tired. I'll go fix your bed. I can do that. You stay right here and do me just one little favour will you? What? Drink your coffee. What's the use of my making good coffee if... Johnny. Yeah? There's something you should know. What? Nothing did happen to me in that awful house. Thanks to you. Go to sleep. He wanna put a big steak on that eye. You want something? No n... Coz you might find it. We was just going. Forget it Mike. The men didn't look at me. Two more coffees please. When a woman's out with me I pay. I'm not a woman, I'm a... You're a woman and you're out with me. Alright. There's no need to be so tough. Why's a girl like you on the game? And why don't I mind my own business? I need money. Who doesn't? I need it quick. What for? I have a kid sister. And you want to send her to college? No! I want to send her to hospital for an operation. Sorry. How's the head? Singng like the birds of dawn. Hey, it is dawn. Yeah good, fine. Ok me lad, see you in a half hour. Well, you can stop worrying. That was Mike, he says that Vicky's ok and so is he. You have a good friend in Mike. So have you in Vicky. Oh I love French cooking. But it's only eggs. Yes but there's that certain something you know. You do your own cooking? Well sure, always. See with the... But you do not wash your curtains do you?

What about? Listen Heath this is important. So's this if you still want the Lindon Street property. I want the girl Malou, I mean I want to talk about her. What do you think we should do with her? Get rid of her. Didn't you hear? I've spent money on that... Cut your losses, you've done it before. This is different. It's different. It's not only the money. You think it's only the money? I've wanted to make her into my... I wanted to make something of her, make her big. Get her out of the gutter. Maybe she prefers the gutter. Maybe she prefers the gutter. Did you find Vicky? She's outside. Get her. You know the ratable value on this place seems rather high. I think we should lodge an appeal. I've wanted to make her big. Ah, you, you were out with Malou last night. Do you think we can make anything of her? I don't think so she's... she's just not the type. There are such girls you know. She could be trained. Well couldn't she? You can train any girl, or break her. She's not worth the trouble Nick. Ok. Ok, if you all say she's not worth the trouble, she's useless... if you all say so, we'll have to get rid of her. Fine, i'll get her back to France tonight. I said get rid of her. No. Take my advice unless you want to face a murder charge. Losing your nerve? No, keeping my head. Keep your advice too. It's yours, you pay for it one way or the other. Get out! All of you. I'll have to get rid of her, she's useless. You're not gonna stand by and let them do this? Look, it's nothing to do with me any longer. But, just... Look, it's the cab driver's business... He doesn't know where to find her either does he? Vicky, Vicky, come quickly, it's your sister. Hurry Vicky, it's Malia. Don't go in there duck, it's too late. But what did she do? She's killed herself. Mayfair cabs. No miss, I'm sorry, he's not on duty now. Well it's not good going on like that, I don't know. No miss I'm sorry, we're not allowed to give private addresses. Oh, well I... Yeah yeah yeah. Oh do come in. It's Malou, they're gonna kill her. Johnny, you gotta do something. Did Nick send you? Please, you don't understand. Alright, I'll get Mike, he'll know what to do. Not so fast, where is she? She's at number 21 Blake Street where I work. Nick's got her locked up. I'll call the boys and they'll get her out there in no time. No. If you go in there with those boys... that'll give Nick plenty of time to get her out of the back entrance. So... You gotta go in there alone. There's only one guy guarding her room so all you have to do is... What's the matter? Well how we gonna get you into the house? I'll be your customer. Come on, get dressed. My back still aches from that beating. Hey what about the guy that's on guard? I'll fix him. How? You'll see. With any luck you should both be out of there by 4 o'clock. Well, just in case. Hello Mike, I want you to come to 21 Blake street at 3.45 with a whole bunch of boys. At 4 o'clock, if i'm not outta that house, you come and get me. And tell Miriam to put out an assistance call for 4. That's right. Let's go. It's on the next floor, room 43. Now give me a few minutes just to get rid of the boyfriend... and you go in there and get her quietly. Only be careful because the place is full of Nick's boys. Hello. Looking for a girl? I got one. Just waiting for her. Some other time. Sure, you know where I live. Don't drop in to tea will you. Bye. Don't you talk to any strange men. Drink? Not without a chaser. I haven't got a chaser. I have.

Go back Johnny, go back. Come on back here, we can get out this way. Right, up you go and don't rush them. Give them a chance to quieten down. Easy there, easy. You can't get in there.
