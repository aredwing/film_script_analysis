JACK OUTSMARTED HALF THE TOWN. MM-HMM. I PROMISED YOU GUYS AUTOGRAPHS, AND WE ARE GONNA GET AUTOGRAPHS. I HAVE A PLAN. OH! HEY. NO ONE'S ALLOWED BACK HERE. OH, THANK GOODNESS! A SECURITY GUARD. MOM ALWAYS SAID, "IF YOU NEED HELP, FIND A SECURITY GUARD." WELL, YOUR MOM SOUNDS LIKE A VERY WISE LADY. WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE? YEAH, WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE? IT'S BEARS. -BEARS? - BEARS! NOT BEARS. I'M TERRIFIED OF BEARS. BEARS ARE THE WORST. WHY WOULD THERE BE BEARS AT A CONVENTION CENTER? IT'S THE DROUGHT. THEY'RE COMING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS. THEY'RE FORAGING FOR FOOD. -MM-HMM. I-I-IN THE DUMPSTER. -ON TOP OF THE PARKING GARAGE. FURTHER DOWN THE ALLEY. WHEN YOU IRONED ON THAT SECURITY BADGE, YOU SWORE AN OATH TO PROTEC THIS CONVENTION CENTER. WELL, TODAY... YOUR CONVENTION CENTER NEEDS YOU. WE NEED A HERO! WE NEED... OTIS. ARE YOU SURE IT WAS BEARS? OH, OTIS... OTIS! WOULD I LIE TO YOU? YOU KIDS STAY HERE. IT'S BEAR SEASON. [REVERSE-ALERT WHINES] NOW WE JUST HAVE TO SIT BACK, RELAX, AND WAIT FOR DANNY KOSTAS TO ROLL IN. HEH. OKAY. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. "I CAN'T BELIEVE OTIS JUST FELL FOR THAT," RIGHT? WELL, NOW, DON'T BLAME HIM, BECAUSE HE NEVER REALLY HAD A CHANCE. SEE, EVERYBODY HAS A SPECIAL TALENT. SOME PEOPLE ARE... ATHLETES. AND SOME PEOPLE CAN PUT THEIR ENTIRE FIS IN THEIR MOUTH. SORT OF. BUT ME? MY SPECIAL TALENT? I CAN LIE. NOW, EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID, I WAS JUST ALWAYS REALLY GOOD AT MAKING STUFF UP. I FIGURED, REGULAR LIFE IS BORING ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. WHY NO SPICE IT UP A LITTLE, HUH? [] LIKE THE TIME I BUSTED MY ARM WHEN I BLEW THE LANDING ON THE SICKEST FLIP OF MY LIFE. GAH! [GROANS] NOW, I COULDN'T TELL MY MOM HOW IT REALLY HAPPENED. SHE SAID ONE MORE ACCIDEN AND MY BIKE WOULD BE HISTORY. SO MAYBE... SO MAYBE MY ARM GOT BROKEN PROTECTING THE HABITA OF AN ENDANGERED OWL FROM TWO TREE-HUNGRY LUMBERJACKS. GET 'IM! [LUMBERJACK SCREAMS] [GROANING] -OH! -[THUD] YOU! OH! AHH! [OWL HOOTING] JACK PARKER, THAT'S WHO. AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW? I GOT TO KEEP MY BIKE AND I MADE MY PARENTS PROUD. NOW, MAYBE I DIDN'T HAVE THE NERVE TO ASK JENNIFER TO THE WINTER FORMAL. HI, JACK. OR ASK HER ANYTHING AT ALL. OR MAYBE I HAD A SMOKIN'-HO GIRLFRIEND FROM ARIZONA WHO DIDN'T WANT ME GOING OUT WITH ANYONE ELSE. [SHRIEKING MANIACALLY] SHE'S SUPER-POSSESSIVE. MAYBE I WENT OVERBOARD ON THAT LIE. BUT... MY BEST LIE, MY GREATEST FABRICATION OF ALL, WAS MIKEY. SEE, MY BELOVED RED SOX WERE IN TOWN, AND RYAN, ERIC, AND I HAD SCORED AWESOME SEATS RIGHT BEHIND HOME PLATE. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS, I HADN'T CLEANED MY ROOM IN EIGHT MONTHS. YOUNG MAN, YOU ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL THIS ROOM IS SPOTLESS. BUT... MOM! [DEJECTED SIGH] I... HAVE TO... HELP... THAT KID. -WHAT KID? -THAT KID THAT... I TUTOR? MOM, I SWEAR, YOU DON'T LISTEN TO A THING I SAY. YOU TUTOR SOMEONE? YEAH, IT'S QUITE WONDERFUL. I, YOU KNOW, I TRY NOT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT. YOU KNOW, JUST DOING MY PART. HELPING A KID-- WHAT'S THIS KID'S NAME? UH, MIKE. BUT I CALL HIM MIKEY, YOU KNOW? WE'RE KINDA TIGHT LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW? I'M KIND OF HIS ONLY FRIEND. I AM SO... [INHALING DEEPLY] PROUD OF YOU! YOU JUST GO. HELP THAT MIKEY, OKAY? SEE WHAT I MEAN? COUPLE OF HARMLESS FABRICATIONS AND... JUST LIKE THAT, THINGS JUST GET INTERESTING. ERIC? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHH! THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST BEARS IS TO PLAY DEAD. GET UP. COME ON. THERE WE GO. OKAY. [] [] DANNY! DANNY! WE LOVE YOU, MAN. MY BOY, RYAN, DOES A PERFECT IMPRESSION OF YOUR BATTING RITUAL. [SNAPS]: SHOW HIM! OKAY. CAN WE GE SOME AUTOGRAPHS? [SNAP] [] AWESOME! SO COOL! [SMACK] MM! TASTES MINTY. AW, WE GOTTA GO! MS. TAYLOR IS GOING TO KILL YOU. OKAY, AND ONE MORE THING. YES. LYING IS WRONG. EXCEPT... MAYBE IT ISN'T. NOW HEAR ME OUT. RIGHT NOW, OTIS THE SECURITY GUARD THINKS HE'S A HERO. AND... WE GOT OUR AUTOGRAPHS. EVERYBODY WINS. NO HARM, NO FOUL. FAKE GIRLFRIEND? LUMBERJACKS? CHECK. BUT THE "MIKEY" STORY, THAT WAS A MASTERPIECE, AND IT TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE. MIKEY BECAME MY GO-TO EXCUSE FOR EVERY SITUATION. YOU KNOW-- GETTING OUT OF CHORES, BREAKING CURFEW, BEING LATE FOR CLASS. PEOPLE WERE HAPPY LETTING ME GET AWAY WITH THINGS, BECAUSE THEY WERE HELPING MIKEY. IT MADE THEM FEEL GOOD, AND MAKING PEOPLE FEEL GOOD CAN'T BE BAD, RIGHT? [] JACK PARKER, YOU'RE LATE. IT'S THE THIRD TIME THIS WEEK. I'M GONNA HAVE TO GIVE YOU DETENTION. I UNDERSTAND. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? IT'S JUST... [SIGHS] I WAS UP ALL NIGH HELPING MIKEY. WITH MATH, HE'S JUST REALLY STRUGGLING, AND HE WANTS TO GET INTO COLLEGE, SO HE CAN MAKE HIS MOM AND HIS FOUR BROTHERS PROUD. I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE HAD FIVE BROTHERS. IT'S FOUR. [VOICE CRACKS]: IT'S FOUR NOW. OHH... HOW ABOUT WE JUST FORGE ABOUT DETENTION FOR TODAY? HMM? [RELIEVED SIGH] THANK YOU. IT'S LIKE I ALWAYS TOLD MIKEY, MS. TAYLOR-- YOU ARE THE TYPE OF TEACHER THAT THEY MAKE MOVIES ABOUT. [TOUCHED CHUCKLE] HEY! SEE? I GET OUT OF DETENTION, AND MS. TAYLOR FEELS GREAT ABOUT HERSELF! MY LIES ARE MAKING OUR SCHOOL-- NO, OUR WORLD-- A BETTER PLACE. [GRUNTING] COME ON! -GIVE THEM BACK! -NO! [LAUGHS] [BULLY STOPS LAUGHING] [EXHALES NERVOUSLY] OH, HEY, LANCE. ACTS OF INJUSTICE LIKE THA REALLY MAKE THE OLD ARM ACHE. YOU KNOW... WHEN I BROKE IT? SINGLE-HANDEDLY TAKING DOWN THOSE LUMBERJACKS? YOU'VE HEARD THE STORY. YOU SNAPPED THEM LIKE TWIGS. TWIGS. OH! OH... UH-- [HUFFS] THERE... THERE YOU GO. NICE AND CLEAN, HUH? [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] THANKS, JACK. YOU'RE ALWAYS STANDING UP FOR THE LITTLE GUYS. SPEAKING OF WHICH, GIVE MY BEST TO MIKEY. I SURE WILL. WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M LIKE A... SUPERHERO OR SOMETHING. [P.A. SYSTEM CRACKLES]: JACK PARKER. THIS IS PRINCIPAL KAR. REPORT TO MY OFFICE IMMEDIATELY. MR. PARKER... I THINK WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS "MIKEY." UH... HEH. UM... WHAT ABOUT MIKEY? THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE HAS BEEN BUZZING WITH TALES ABOUT YOU TUTORING A MYSTERIOUS BOY FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL. AND I HAVE TO SAY... I AM VERY, VERY IMPRESSED. TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE TO HELP OTHERS, IT'S... [SIGHS] OH, IT'S MADE US ALL VERY PROUD. YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHERE THIS IS GOING. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS GOING. HE'S GONNA NOMINATE ME FOR "STUDENT OF THE YEAR." I AM GOING TO NOMINATE YOU-- [GIGGLING GIDDILY] YOU! ...FOR "STUDENT OF THE YEAR." WHAT? "STUDENT OF THE YEAR!" I-I-I WAS REALLY NOT EXPECTING THIS. I MEAN, HELPING MIKEY IS ITS OWN REWARD. THE WINNER GETS HIS OR HER CHOICE OF ANY SUMMER INTERNSHIP. YOU MEAN LIKE THE BAT BOY FOR THE BOSTON RED SOX? THAT KIND OF INTERNSHIP? YOU DA MAN! [GAME ANNOUNCER]: AND NOW... FULFILLING HIS LIFE-LONG DREAM, PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR YOUR HOMETOWN HERO AND FUTURE ALL-STAR RED SOX BAT BOY... JACK PARKER-R-R-R! [CROWD ROARING, FIREWORKS POPPING] UH, JACK? OH! UH... I MEAN, IF I WERE TO WIN, THEN THAT'S WHAT I WOULD CHOOSE, YOU KNOW. BUT-- [SIGHS] IT'S JUST AN HONOR TO BE NOMINATED. OH, JACK! I AM SO PROUD OF YOU! OH... MOM, I LIVE TO MAKE YOU PROUD. [JACK CHUCKLES] SO, UH, WHY ARE YOU PROUD OF ME? YOUR PRINCIPAL CALLED. YOU'RE ONE OF THE FIVE FINALISTS FOR "STUDENT OF THE YEAR"! OH... THAT. NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED. NEVER. LIKE, EVER. NEVER EVER. EVER. NEVER? EVER. YOU HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH TO THAT MIKEY. YOU DESERVE THIS AWARD. AND I KNOW WHERE WE'RE GONNA PUT IT! RIGHT HERE, SO EVERYONE CAN SEE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE I DO DESERVE IT. SPEAKING OF DOING SOMETHING GOOD-- I NEED ONE OF YOU TO HELP ME CLEAN OU THE GARAGE TODAY. I THINK A POSSUM DIED IN THERE. PLACE IS GETTING PRETTY RIPE. WELL, I CAN'T DO IT. NICK'S TAKING ME TO DINNER AT THE WIENER PALACE FOR OUR THREE-WEEK ANNIVERSARY. HOW 'BOUT IT, SPORT? OH, DAD, YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SPEND SOME QUALITY BONDING TIME SEARCHING FOR A ROTTING MARSUPIAL CORPSE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW I WOULD!

POINT IS-- I TELL ONE MORE KILLER MIKEY STORY ON AIR, AND I HAVE THAT "STUDEN OF THE YEAR" AWARD LOCKED. YEAH, BUT TELLING EVERYONE YOU HELD A BOTTLE DRIVE TO RAISE MONEY TO BUY A BIONIC TAIL TO SAVE MIKEY'S SICK DOG? I MEAN, MAYBE YOU'RE GOING TOO BIG. NO, THIS IS THE TIME TO GO BIG. IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH. I GOTTA SWING FOR THE FENCES. MAYBE I SHOULD GO BIGGER. [SNAPS] WHAT IF... ITS TAIL SHOOTS LASERS? THAT'D BE AWESOME. A LITTLE TOO BIG, BUDDY. BUT I LIKE WHERE YOUR HEAD'S AT. I'M STICKING WITH THE REGULAR BIONIC TAIL. I'M INSPIRED JUST THINKING OF IT. HEY, JACK. OH, HI! UH-- JEN... ...NIFER. HOW'S, EH...? HI. YOU CAN'T TALK TO HER. OH.

DO I DESERVE STUDENT OF THE YEAR? THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE. WHAT I DO KNOW IS, STUDENT OF THE YEAR WAS THE FURTHEST THING FROM MY MIND THE DAY I FINALLY RAISED ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY MIKEY'S POOR, SICK DOG A ROBOT TAIL. [CANNED AUDIENCE "AW"ING AND GUSHING] YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE LITTLE GUY... WAGGING THAT THING. I MEAN, HE ALMOST TOOK OFF. [QUIETLY TO SELF]: THIS MAN IS AN ARTIST. I MAY NOT HAVE THE BEST GRADES OR THE PERFECT ATTENDANCE, BUT I'M THE TYPE OF GUY THAT'LL RAISE MONEY TO BRING A POOR, SICK DOG'S BUT INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. I JUST WISH... I WISH MIKEY COULD BE HERE RIGHT NOW. IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH FOR ME TO SHARE THIS MOMENT WITH HIM. [SNIFFLING] IF HE WERE HERE RIGHT NOW, I WOULD TELL HIM-- [BOY]: TELL ME WHAT, JACK? WHO SAID THAT?
