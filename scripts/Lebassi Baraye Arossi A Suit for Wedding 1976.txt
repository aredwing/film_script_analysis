Abbas Abad! - You're just now getting here? - Go serve the tea. Hi. It won't be ready by Thursday. Time will be needed for alterations and fittings. But it's Saturday. Did I say otherwise? I only said it won't be ready. We simply must have his suit for Thursday. - Is Mamad Reza here? - He's gone out. What's happening on Thursday, then? It's his sister's wedding. A happy occasion! Drink! Your tea will get cold. You should join us. - Thanks very much. - This is your place. God willing. But with so little help, I don't have the time. This looks like the suit that he already has. He chose it himself. If it's what he likes, I can't say no. He must learn how to make his own decisions... to make his own way in life. Eventually, he'll need to choose his studies, his craft.... he'll need to know how to choose a wife, what he wants from life... for all of that he'll need to be independent. That's what I hope for... so that's how I approach bringing up my children. Which pattern does he want? - What is his name, again? - Reza. Mister Reza, choose. Which style would you like? I don't know. There are plenty of styles. Pick one that you will like. Come show me which one. That one? That seems a bit much. Take down the measurements! Come on, take off your jacket. Why bother with measurements if you won't be able to finish in time. You're going to a lot of trouble for nothing. We'll sort it out. It must be ready by Thursday since his sister must be married. as they have joy! It's only the first. I can't wait for them to come, one by one. That shouldn't be too burdensome. Oh yes, it should. As you must well know if you have any kids. Believe me. I do. Wouldn't they be poorer all the same if they had no kids? That's true. - Hi. - Hello. is good like that? A little larger. Make it 26. Leave a large hem in the legs. Okay. He's shooting up as fast as a rice stalk. These kids kill me. When did you have the clothes he is wearing made? It was at least a year ago and he's already grown out of them. Must have been two years. That's hard to believe. No. It was last year. I am the one who orders his clothes. I am his mother. Why are you telling me two years? I know what I'm saying. The cotton batting that I used for his outfit... ...it's been two years since I've been able to find any. Put your jacket back on, my boy. Find a way to put the extra fabric to use. Don't worry. Reza Hachemi. Let's see... today is Saturday. Come in for fittings on Sunday and Tuesday. I will try to have it finished by Thursday evening. But we must have the suit for Thursday morning. Who holds a wedding in the morning! We're going to Karaj in the morning. He must take an exam and return in the afternoon. All right. I'll try to get it done. Thank you very much. - He doesn't need a vest? - If there's enough fabric... No. There's just enough. Is the fabric nice? Yes. What is it worth? It's worth whatever you paid. - I guess you paid about 60 tomans? - 95. After countless negotiations. That's about right. Hossein! Tell him to come out. I need to talk to him. - What? - You coming to lunch? I'll be right down. Machdi! Send in the lunch! Yeah. Hurry up. - Mamad is pumped up. - What about? He's back at it. He asked me for a suit today. I've told you a hundred times not to give it to him. He's a bully, he'll tear you to pieces. If I lent it to him before, it's on account of you. I really need it. Not him. Besides... he'll tear it. He said he really needed it. That's bull. I'm careful. I'll bring it back... in good condition. He said that in exchange, he'd teach me karate. You're kidding. He doesn't know karate. - He said he did. - He made it up. He's made up some bull to scare you. Why should I be scared? He brags to you about karate just to get the suit. Besides, he doesn't need it. Shh... he's coming. - Hey. - Hey. Your friends ditch you? - What friends? - Yes, sir? You haven't asked me what happened to my eye? There was a fight at the karate club. - What do you want to eat? - An omelette. He's making it up. You don't go to the club for fights. You'll see that he's not lying. I know him better than you. So... tell me where he goes. He goes to classes. His bag is always full of books. Now way. He goes to karate. - What'll it take to make you see? - What? - According to you, he goes to karate? - Yeah. I'll follow him after work. - Which days does he go? - He said every other day. - Today? - No. Tomorrow. Tomorrow, everything will be cleared up. - You think he doesn't go to karate? - No. Then why do you avoid him on the staircase? Fighting's not my style. If it was, would you lend me any suits? - No. - You're still going to lend it to me? And you're telling me about my problems! The ones you've lent be before got returned in one piece, didn't they? Yeah. Okay then. Well? It's not your size anyway. - You're saying it's his size? - Yes. But I am the same size. You're bigger, but not as strong as him. So it's a crime not to pick fights? You'd lend me the suit if I was a fighter? - I never said I'd lend it to you. - Yes you did. - He paid you. - No. You're screwed up. What do you want, anyway? I have three, right here, four that I gave to Mamad. that makes 48. That makes 48. Plus 24 with Chabestarian's, 72. and 3 that I have right here, that makes 23. There you have it: - You've brought over some work? - Yeah. - How many? - 48. You haven't brought all of them with you? The rest are down stairs. I'll bring them up later. - Thanks. - See you later. - You want to be paid for these? - Sure. - Here's the payment for 48. - See you. We're friends aren't we? The one time I ask you for something! - The jacket isn't your size. - Oh really? I saw the boy who came into the shop. He was exactly the same size. - I'm not lying to you. - Let me try it on and then we'll see. Yes, sir? - Is he in? - No. He's at prayers. - When will he be back? - In a quarter hour. - You down there, Ali? - Yes. I'm coming. Why haven't you gone to the club? I have to finish this. I'll go afterwards. - If I go, will you lend it to me? - What? - The suit. - It's not your size. Are we friends or what? Let me try it on, just to see. I need it for Wednesday or Thursday, for one hour in the night. I have to deliver it Thursday morning. - Let's say Wednesday then. - He'd know. Shh! He's coming. - Hey, Hossein. - Hey. Hey, Ali. You've already finished that suit? - Got any empty glasses, Hossein? - No. - Did I tell you about the jerk? - No. - I must have told you. - You started to in the cafeteria. Here's the rest: when I got to the club, he insulted me so I kicked his ass, he came back and punched me in the eye, right here. And then one of the guy's friends took a swing at me... and knocked my breath out. I gave him a shove and he went tumbling into the gutter. - Just outside the club? - Yeah, in the street out back. The guy fell, and the others came after me. When they saw that I'd beat him down, they came after me in the alley behind the club. There were two huge containers... I tipped them over on the guys just behind me. When the others saw that, they got even more pissed, and they began coming after me again. And then I ran into one of my cool buds from the club, I said to him: "How's it going, Hossein?" I bummed 25 cents from him and I jumped into a taxi. I need to borrow 25 cents from Ali to repay him. - I don't have any money. - I'll give it back on Friday. I'd give it to you if I had it. And you, Hossein? And my 5 tomans? You always have some new story to mooch off of me. Go ask anybody you want to at the club. - You won't lend it to me? - No. What are we friends for then? It's nothing, 25 cents. Would I ever refuse? - Come on, give it to me. - I don't have it. I told you. - You don't have it? - No. No? You don't have anything? Ali, you're my witness. You could pay back the guy's I'm only saying that I bet you have some change in your pockets. I have some, but I'm saving it to buy some bread. He said he didn't have anything. I know that you'd only go off and bet it away. It's for your own good. I swear, Ali, he says that every time. It's for my own good? - Come on, lend me 25 cents. - If you had just been honest, I would have lent it to you. It's settled then! You'll lend it to me if I tell you the truth? I haven't eaten, I feel faint. Ali, do you believe this? We know you eat at your boss's place, and you come begging to us? He gave my lunch to somebody else, and told me I'd have to buy something to eat. - You dig? - Yeah. - I need my strength for the club. - Why do you go there? Mind your own business. Your brother slaves away day and night to earn money thinking that you're going to school not to the club. That's none of your business. I used to be studious and, every time I went near the gym, - I got beat up. - You set everything up for a fight. Set things up however you want. Keep going to class. But when you get your diploma, when you try to go to America with your girl, and some weakling tells you that you can't, then you'll find yourself with a bloody nose. You'll say to yourself: "Mamad was right." Nobody's forced to fight if they don't want to. People just have happy accidents? You always have a come back. I'm telling you no as a friend. You're my friend? Really and truly? Give me the 25 cents, Ali is my witness. - It's not a question of money. - Then hand it over cheapskate! You'll give it back to me? - Yeah. - When? Thursday. At the end of the week. It's for Ali's sake that I'll do it. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So, you're going to lend it me? - What? The suit. - He'll know. - No. I'll sort it out. It won't fit you. I'll leave it unbuttoned. I'll bring it back without a wrinkle. Well, we'll see. If my boss leaves early... What time does he leave? - 7:30 at night. - I'll come around then. A customer. He's come for a fitting. It will be ready Thursday morning? Come Wednesday evening. You're open until... Until dinner time. I doubt I can make it. If his father comes home early, I'll try to come and catch you. Otherwise, I will have to come Thursday moring. No problem, come Thursday Thanks so much. What's Mamad look like? I don't know. About this tall, brown hair. I can't tell from that... go take another look. The body must be held at How's it going? What are you doing here? - How about you,? - I was at the club. - Why didn't I see you? - I was in the locker room. - I didn't see you. - I was in the locker room. - You headed home? - Yeah. - Give me a lift. - I have to return the scooter. - Drop me off. It's on your way. - You're such a bore. What were you doing there? I was signing up for karate. You'll be out cold with the first punch. Think I'm weaker than you? One kick and you'll be flat on your back. That's why I'm signing up for karate. - You have money, at least? - Sure. Turn around, we'll go sign you up! I wanted some information. So you have to ask your father first. What do you mean by thatr? Last time, he chewed you out. Is it my father or your brother who is the problem? My brother slaps me but you're weaker than I am. - How am I weaker? - In every way. First, you have to sign up and then you need 90 tomans. You have to go to karate class three times a week and you have three days at school. Your boss won't let you go. Never mind that, I'll figure it out. I have a better idea. I know somebody who teaches karate. He only asks for 30 tomans per month. He'd teach you during lunch break close to work. - And who is that? - Who'd be better than me? You yourself need a teacher. - Me, need a teacher? - Yeah. How long have you been taking karate? I've been going to the club for 11 months, you dig? On the first day, the master gave me a little tap and I flew across the room. Afterwards, I had bruises everywhere. I couldn't even put on my jacket. I was dropping the tea trays that I had to serve. You're a worker, like me, you have lots of work. So if you want, I could teach you the basics. After a little practice, you can sign up at the club on one condition. What's that? Sort things out with Ali so I can have the boy's suit. Do that for me, I need to go somewhere. He won't even lend it to me. Have you forgotten about that suit that you borrowed last year? There won't be any fighting. I swear I'll bring it back in one piece. I don't believe your promoses. - You don't care about karate, then? - Yes I do. Then bring me that suit. He won't lend it to anyone. Not even to me. Last year, you brought one back with a torn pocket. Ali had to bend over backwards to keep the boss from finding out. - And if he agrees? - We'll see. - Stop here. - Wait. - Wait, you walk back a few steps. - No. My feet hurt. - See you. - See you. I'm off. - What time is it? - 7:30. Hossein. - What are you doing here? - How about you? What have you done with the suit? It was for me! Hand it over or you'll see! I have some integrity, and I went out of my way. I don't care. Don't I have integrity? - Why do you need it? - Never mind that! Hand it over or I'll hit you. - It's not up to me. - And what will he do to you? Ali lent it to me and I have to return it to him. I'll give it to you so that you can return it to him yourself. - Ha! such a girl. - Shut up. - I'll go call him. - I'll bring it back in 30 minutes. I'll lend it to you and you'll return it to him. - Well, what are you waiting for? - You're exhausting. - Ha! Such a girl - Just shut up! - Why is she looking at us? - What's that supposed to mean? It means what it seems to mean. What does it mean to you? I'll show you, don't worry. You can bust a nose with a single punch. You'll see. But take off the jacket, so the blood doesn't stain it. But... here... Stop talking and take it off! - I can't do it here. - Hurry up and take it off. - I can't do it here. - Hurry up and hand it over! Somebody might recognize us. - Who cares. - I'm willing to lend it to you, but if we change here, I'll be ashamed. You were supposed to get this suit for me! When did I say that? You're going to lend it to me, or things will be bad for you! I never promised to lend it to you. I was ready to teach you karate, and I'll do it right now. You dig? Anyway, hand over the jacket. Not here. You better hand it over if you want to learn karate. - But not here... - Insulting me now like this! - People know us around here. - Who cares about people! So much fuss about taking off a jacket! - Take it off. - We can't do it here. Stop arguing. Take it all off. The pants. - It's not right. - Who cares. Take it all off. Take it all off. I have the jacket, now I need the pants. Take them off! Stop insulting me. The man's playing modest. Do it now! At least we could go do it in Ali's shop. What do I have to do with Ali? Yeah. You don't have anything to do with him. There. Have a look! Don't soil them with your shoes! - That's for resistance. - That's right! What a tailor Mr. Hassan is! There better not be any tears, I'm warning you. Cut it out with all that! - Well, see you. I'm going. - Where are you going? Wait! Let go of me, you'll tear my jacket! My money is in the pocket. What money? In this pocket? - I won't touch it. Promise. - Give it to me! I told you that I'll give it back. But I need it. Stop worrying! I'll bring it back, I said. It's not true. I know it! Ali? - What? - Open up. It's me. Hossein! - What is it? - Mamad has taken the suit. - Where do you think he's at? - Over at Reza's place, maybe. Thank you. Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. You must excuse me for failing to salute you at the beginning. Don't suspect that I'm trying to pass myself off as a foreigner. I'm Iranian and proud of it! Thank you. For your further amusement, we are going to welcome a child from the audience. We need a little boy to come onto the stage. Bravo! Welcome. Everything okay? Your name? Mamad? How old are you Mamad? But I asked for a little boy. You're old enough to be a grandfather! Allow us to call for a younger boy. Is there a little boy who is ready to come up on stage? Yes. Come. No. Don't go. Stay. We will need you! The show has only just begun. Introduce yourself. Babak Kazemi. I present Mr. Babak Kazemi. Hold on. Are you looking for something? How old are you? - One. - Just one year old? What a boy! Bravo! - Have you ever seen a chicken? - Yes. What does the chicken say when she lays her eggs? She says, "cluck, cluck, cluck." She says, "cluck, cluck, cluck." But it's not as simple as that. Isn't that so, sir? What does the chicken say when she lays her eggs? Bravo! He's laid at least four eggs! Babak Kazemi. Mr. Kazemi, which is your right hand? Bravo! That's exactly right. This. This is the right hand and this one here, it's the left. Here, this is the water tank. This here is the spigot and this is the pump. Put your right hand to your ear. Bravo. And here is some water for the tank. Pour me some water. Aren't you thirsty? It's hot, this water! I'm going to pump to see if there is any water in the tank. And we pump... There we are. Allow me. We pump. We forgot to open the spigot! There's the tank and so here should be the valve. Let it all out. There it is. You're relieved? Thank you. You may return to your seat. Not you. Take a seat. What did you say your name was? You are a student? What do you do besides? An apprentice server. I want to play a game with you. It sure is hot in here. Allow me to open your shirt, to help you to relax. There you are. Leave it just so. Thank you. Gurgle, gurlge. It would be a shame to let it go to waste, it should be put to good use, so allow me to store it here. - His lights are out. - Maybe he's in the shop. - What are you doing here? - We've come to see Reza. - We're closed. - Reza, the shirt tailor. - We're closed. - But is he here? We're closed. Scram! - Good morning Machdi Esmal. - Good morning. How are you? Come and have some tea. - Mamad isn't here? - No. - He was here yesterday? - Yes. - When did he leave? - About 6, I guess. Stay, please! Thanks. It's okay. Mamad! Come here. - Good morning. - Where were you last night? - Reza's place. - I'll teach you to go to Reza's! You want to become a thief, is that it? Stop it! Let him be. I'm going to kill him. So you have no parents? You want to end up a thief? Rascal! He's done nothing to deserve that! Good lord, this kid will kill me! He's going to drive me mad. This isn't the first time. It never ends! Let's go. I'm begging you. I'm telling you he's driving me mad. I'm falling to pieces. And he goes and hides out at Reza's! Calm down. It's nothing. Forgive him. I'm not good for much myself but as soon as I could, I began to work. At his age, I swear... I was supporting three people. Him... he can't even support himself. I have to buy his books and whatever else, I have no idea... He didn't run off, you know. And anyway, he's your brother. Yeah, you don't say. It's nothing. Forgive him. - You're a good man. - Yeah, you don't say. Here, he earns money. From me, nothing but mooching and from his sister-in-law, too. You know what he's done? He's gotten a new suit! And me? Well? I haven't touched a new shirt in ages. Times have changed, my friend. Today, people are judged by what they wear. They're young, they want to dress up. I have nothing against it. We were once young, too. But times have changed. And what should we be if the young didn't wear suits? But him? He isn't even capable of keeping his suit clean. They're young. They tear their clothes and fight. Not like us. I've been wearing the same suit for nine years. What would I wear otherwise? Machdi's work, maybe? If you had tailored it, I'd rather wear nothing. Machdi Esmal's tailoring is the flea market. You weren't even a tailor yet when I was sewing clothes for 12 tomans. At that time, all the suits were coming from Beirut, an outfit went for 8 tomans. Back then, I was making clothes for 12 tomans. Can you imagine? Tell me. Who was wearing these clothes that cost 12 tomans? Myself. Who do you think? Go look somewhere else if I didn't! You never saw me when I was young. I had lots of affairs! You should have seen me! There was a Syrian girl who often came to see me. Full of hopes. It was really something. We'd known one another since our early teens. I asked: "Where are you going?" She told me: "I've been invited to travel to China." This woman had five or six daughters Beautiful as the heart! Sweet as peaches. They were all in love with me. And I was in love with them. There was one, truly delicious, luminous as the moon, graceful as a swan. "Your love will eventually kill me! "Why do you torture me "with so much cruelty?" Machdi Esmal is lost in memories of his youth. - Have some tea. - We haven't come to drink. We're in a hurry... he has an exam to pass. Let him try on the jacket. Put on your jacket, my boy. The collar isn't a little loose? Not at all. Just the right size. A boy grows so fast. Let him try on the pants, too. - No problem. Wrap it up. - Very well. Wrap it up. Soon, it will be Reza's turn. Soon, he'll be wearing a wedding suit. Hopefully. God bless the happiness of all young people! May they all fulfill their dreams! Goodbye. Goodbye. Sorry. May I take a look at the pants? I told you that he could try them on. I wanted to see the bottom hem. I left a hem of 4 centimeters. Enough for at least 4 alterations. - Thanks very much. - Goodbye. Here you are.
