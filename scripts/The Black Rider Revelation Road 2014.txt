Come And I looked, and behold, one black horse; And he that sat on him had a balance in hand Revelation 6:5 2 years after the event Wolf Point, Montana Abner! I say... Mr. Drake, please! It was just a meat pie! My family was hungry. I'll pay! We know from high school! Look what you do! Is not right! Abner! Abner! You're right, Drake, look at you! We are all hungry. Would you forgive him? Want anarchy...? Theft, rape and murder unpunished? Want to live outside like them? Scavengers and cannibals? Is that what you want? Then pack and go! Not what I meant. I thought so. We are civilized people and I keep order... regardless. Come on! Kill him now! Do not leave! Drives very well. Get the molotov! Not understand. Take out the good stuff!

The Black Rider: Revelation Road Stay away! It's mine! I thirst. Am I going to die? There is no alternative. Mr. Drake, president appreciates effort here at the border. Your situation is difficult. Not need praise, but food, weapons. The board believes that their rations are suitable climate and population. Are a joke! My people starve. Well see, some unscrupulous mayors these border towns hog rations. They feed well with their delegates while the rest suffer hunger, But do not believe you. Sea of those. Of course not. The next year every citizen must be identified, evaluated and have a range. Believe me, Mr. Drake, there are advantages having a high rank. What do you want in return? To evaluate its usefulness, ULC asked capture a criminal called the Pastor in its territory. Sounds easy; But it is not. No matter. It is a priority for President. Should catch it.

Out of the car! Hands up! Okay. All Right. Shame on you! Bring a girl wound. What will reject not pay you? Drake will know, Sofia. I'm warning you! Maybe you speak of that poison you call liquor and plants in your basement. My basement would be a good place to hide you corpse. He comes with me. We'll see. You really can afford? I risked his neck for you. I pay. Thank You. 'm Josh. No matter. Follow Me. Can we go faster? We must draw attention. Idiots! What is your problem? They are hungry. The mayor keeps them at bay. But not you? That will not matter. Make heal your wife and go. It is my wife; Just 16 Yes, of course. Scavengers abducted. His parents asked me to rescue her. Is that yours: Rescuing girls? Just trying to help whenever I can. Another religious fanatic. A what...? A tip: Do not try to preach here. People do not want to hear that. Over there. Stab in the abdomen. Good. Step back, please. How serious is it? No I'll steal. It is better not to see. Sheriff! Sheriff! There is a problem in the past. Take care. Show me. Really you care for her! Are you surprised? Think so. Who cares for others not last long out there. And it looks like you've been active while. I was in northern awhile. In the north? Yes, many need help there. What? I heard legends of the north, about a man , a fan that helps people Are you? It's everything I have. Is it enough? Lord, the wound is deep. There are many damages. I'm not qualified. Are not you Doctor? No. Y is there anyone else who can help? Not anymore. My mom was the surgeon village. Was it? Where is? 's Gone. It's everything you need to know. Is she alive? I do not know. Listen, we have antibiotics to keep her alive a few days. This will cover the expenses. How many days? Maybe three. After more would have to ask the mayor, and I know what his answer. Do it. Where is your mother? Oh, no. Nice car. My chief says you illegally entered the village.. Here we take seriously the law. I let him in, Victor. Bring a wounded girl. You shut. This is what will happen: I give you your keys and pay a fine. If you can not afford... work. Do not behave well. Keys. Kill him! Knees, or I'll kill you. He did nothing. It was my fault! 'll Take care of you later. Take your hands off me! It's a 1972 Plymouth Roadrunner With 383 engine, go! 's My new baby. Treat it well. What a view! Huh? Come on, give me a reason. Tomorrow hang it with my hand holding the rope, as I feel how you asphyxia Sal I think it's a bad idea. Let me think. Josh McManus. Do you know? Occasionally come here religious fanatics. Rangers crossed only cause problems. God talk a lot but do not respect our laws. But lock them over drinks and see how they really are. Where are you going? Where do I want to reach? I think you're authentic. I come all these stories on a black rider north a man of God who never lost a fight. I just tried to save the girl; Did not want to cause problems. You came to my village illegally attacking my delegates. Now I hang. 's The law. But... Luckily, both want the same thing: A Grace's mother, Sofia, and town doctor. The need, we. Where is? Have you heard of Pastor? Yes, it is something of a prophet. It's a tramp. Name is George Hilcott. Last winter roamed the people saying crazy things. One day just disappeared. Thought he was dead; Then I heard who was gathering followers , and performing miracles. Grace ran after him in the summer. We send people to search. Some returned empty handed. Others never returned. And you think I I can find it? My men could not find hay in a haystack , but you have experience and motivation. But there is more. Do you know who I was? A nobody. Worked at the gas station half time. Not want to be in charge of anything. Then came the Day learned something of myself. That would not be victim of anyone. I killed many men who thought they could rob me and harassing me. Suddenly half the village was gone, half sought my leadership so I gave it. You see, some want to relive as before, not just survive. I can not afford to think prophets and miracles, but I'm not blind. I have seen unexplainable things. This Pastor... We found their tracks and camps; But it's like chasing a ghost. Some believe it is a genuine saint, and that only a man of faith can find it. So you think I can find because I have faith? Find the Pastor and find Grace , so will save the girl. O stay to hang morning. You decide. 're Lucky, jockey. Next time I'll break it in half. There you go, with gas and oil. It's a beauty. 80 miles west. Know that using this corridor Christians to smuggle refugees crossing the border into Canada. Will return to the doctor. Do not let her die. Up to you. Are you sure of what you do? The perfect man for the job appears at the right time... 's something I can not ignore. Do you see me face religious? They took no gasoline, meat only. Hello. Hey! Hey! Josh, let me out! Are you kidding? See? Sheriff? What it does Mr. Drake, why takes our supplies? She is an outsider. We care ours first. But it die. How is the signal? The satellite is online. We're on the move. We have a problem. Sofia is not. Not find her anywhere. Been slope of self at all times? Yes, of course. Well, maybe not all the time, now that I think about. She ruined everything. Come on!

Johnny, where are you going? The people, Mom. Should I make a delivery. Where is your brother? Is back today with prey. Yuck! I ate meat. Oh, good. Are not you going to cry? To beg for your life? Not among my priorities for today. Do not know where to find Pastor, do you? Do not say that name under my roof. We brought ruin. 's What he promised: Hell and damnation if we arrepentamos. But I will not deceive me. Not a prophet; Is a demon. But do you know where I can find? Mom wants to experiment with new flavors. I've told that not work here; But your car is worth 10 times what your flesh. Bobby! Someone came! I'm coming, Mom. I'm coming. Hey. Fast food, refreshments. This place sucks. Chocolates, whipped cream. What? No longer exist and never will. These farmers scare me. Why do not we kill and we took the car? In my country we learn soon you can not get money the dead. Hey, one of these days you tell me where you are, right? Hey! None of your business where I am! Hello, gentlemen. Josh? Josh! I told you not to follow me. Well, if you want to be dinner, for me is fine. I go. Okay. Find the key. Good. Watch. Great. Quiet. There are so many. Just focus. Easy for you to say. Bobby, when will be ready my ribs?

Were saved. Sorry. Although I guess is good, right, because they are in Heaven. Can you teach me to believe what you believe? As a child never went to church.

I'll draw them. Then, count to ten, and runs into the house. Do not leave until ready for you. Wait, no. Josh! One, I see. Why are you running? Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Hello?

We're going to find and your wife too! I had the opportunity to kill and I did not. Go away. Not scare us! You were lucky! It's not luck. Over here! Bobby... Sorry, there knew there was someone here. Okay, dear. It's nice to see a friendly face. I do not get very often visits. Listen, get off to your basement and hide. Hiding? What is happening? There are people in the forest who wants to kill us. Can you hear them? That does not worry me. Young people always fighting. Love how the trees in the winter look. Do not they look beautiful? Come on, we have to hide. Okay. How is it called? Beatrice. I say Aunt Bea, but never married. Maybe I regret not having children. I was a midwife, you know. Saw many babies die in childbirth, guess I removed the idea. The Good Lord is the only husband I needed. Aunt Bea? Hi, do you know? It's nice to see a friendly face. I do not get very often visits. How do I...? Why are you still here? Do not you hear call you? Who? Jesus. I do not think. I do not know. Do not you know? Well, you better start listening. It's almost time. What does it mean? Time for what? What? The end. Tell me, how do I hear? If you want, you will hear. Jesus is the door. Whoever enters through Him be saved. I do not understand. Do not understand me, girl? Do not you know your verses? All in the Bible, in the Good Book. Lord I'm coming, I hear you. I love how it smells the forest in the winter. Does not she look beautiful? Sofia? Sofia! Josh! Sofia! Okay. Okay. Okay. The vehicle is here. I see neither the rider nor Sofia. What do you want? The owner of this vehicle, where is it? Well, what you're seeing. Where did you get? Previous owner, is he still alive? I'm not saying anything. I want to talk to him. Listen, parasite, allow you to do your business because you serve a purpose. Now serves your purpose. Listen, This is my world. You you hide behind your walls but are free men here. Yes! Do not be stupid. No gasoline you are nothing, 'd finished. Then maybe longer allow your boys come to here. No more games, more fun. I do not think you want that. What is it worth to you? Two barrels. Done. I should have asked for more. Okay, I'll be honest, I bought this car the crazy farm. That's it. Go and talk to them. Come, let's party. Yes! Where, boss? Farm? No, no, he's still alive. The McCallister would have taken more. Still alive and will come by your self. Do you still have your man there? Yes, and do what you say for the right price. Well, get away a bit. Not want a battle. Give your man cell and ask him to watch the car. If Sofia is with Josh, make sure you do not go with him. Kill it if you must. Was so fast. I pulled the trigger and was dead. Very fast, very easy. When you have a gun not consider other options. Yes Is that all? No longer can I, you know, go to heaven. Do not kill, right? Jesus is the way to heaven. Is the only way. Turn the other cheek. He said that, right? Yes What if someone wants to kill you? Still causes me load it. ABCs seems that one has no choice, fight or die but when you have faith, when you believe in truth there is always an option. Death is not the end Are not you afraid of death? No. know I'm going to a better place. Should not be difficult. Why does God allow it all happen? How can allow suffering? But now we see the truth. Now that your hand is gone, His light, His love, see how the world without Him. Nothing to curb selfishness, evil. But if you know you're going to a good place, why do you still fighting? For you. For those who are outside, there is still a chance. I can help. Can I help you find the door. And so worth fighting. 're A good man. I almost forgot how is a good man. Maybe you're the last one left. Josh? Josh is not here, dear. Where is? Outside, looking for help. Keep fighting, going to succeed. I'm praying for you. Pray for Josh. Josh can take care of himself. Rest. Not understand. He... is important. Going to do something. What will you do? One man told me that Josh will do... can not remember. Maybe it was just a dream. Showed me a hammer, a witness, a white man, a city moving, a broken spear a golden bridge, fire endless a throne of light. Many people deny the Day, say that did not happen, was a solar flare or something. Are we supposed to even talk about it , especially if the ULC are nearby. But I'm no fool; I know what I saw. Was in Denver, at a music festival y were thousands of people there, and had to close the street. Was on a double date with Brian , my boyfriend, And my mom and her new friend. I forget his name. Suddenly a light filled the sky. First we thought it was part of the show, but then realized it was something different. He moved through you, knew every part of you. Then we heard a sound, as a pump or an earthquake, people panicked, ran everywhere. It was crazy. That was the first time I saw someone die, but then I saw them. People who shone brightly from within, but were not afraid. Vanished in light and flew. What about you? Where were you on the Day? A small village. I had trouble with a gang of motorcyclists and killed several. Not a day passes without anyone wants to kill you? One day after I met the Lord, a little late. Teach me, please. I'm not the guy you want. Perhaps the Pastor can... But I'm asking you. I tell you what it says here, but up to you to believe. What does it say? Well, Jesus is speaking, here says: I am the way, the truth, and the life; No one comes to the Father but by me. Yes, but I do not understand. Want you to start from the beginning. Can you teach it? Okay. In the beginning God created the heavens and earth. The earth was without form and void. What you must remember is that salvation can not be bought or gained like a prize. Is a relationship. It is through faith, through devotion , for his sacrificial blood on the cross opened the door of Heaven. But we have to accept it. I resisted for a long time, not think He could love someone like me. No, believed that He would die for someone like me, did the things I did. But I was wrong. He can do and did. Does it make sense what I mean? More than you think. Arrived. Stay close to me. Already arrived. Take off from here, cockroaches! OMG. 're The girl from Drake. What do you do outside the reserve, honey? Quiet, come with me. Hey idiots, stop him! 're In trouble, man. Now you loaded it, huh? My turn! What I have! Pguenle, pguenle! Yes, yes! Wait. I want to see this. It's mine! Get out! Hey, why come and ruin my party? 'd Have to stick a bullet. Is my car. Correction is my car. Whoever finds it is. You want it, you have to cambirmelo. It was stolen. I have nothing to change you. But you have. Yes you have. Here is a good merchandise. I pay well for it in the territories of the king. I'm not for sale. Well then, it's over. No deal, goodbye, goodbye. O, unless... Unless what? Well, you're a good fighter y Honcho knows how to make money. Men and free women from border areas, games are about to begin!

And finally, the latest challenger The Black Rider! Okay, whatever, place your bets! So what do you think competition? Do you think you can beat them? Your accent Where did he go? That's just for show. I get well, right? Yes, I guess. No, it's great. Look, I was a professor of Theatre at the Center for Advanced Studies St. Charles. An accent makes me mysterious, dangerous. I have a good feeling about you and me working together. I just want this over with and go away. Where you have to go so fast? You can make a fortune. Look, I handle everything. A girl is dying and you do not waste my time with your games. Am looking for a PhD, Sofia mom. Grace? Thought I was dead. Who told you that? O disappeared, do not know.

You can not leave without them. Hey, what are you standing there like idiots? Go for it! Oh, hey we move. Oh, no, no, no. What? We leaking fuel. How far is Pastor camp? I do not know, nobody knows where it is. Shot, man put a mark on the map. Josh, the man was crazy. Just look. Remains as 32 miles away. We fail to arrive. Can you patch it? No time. Already come. You did everything possible, Josh. More than any other he had. No, it is not. You were right, I got limitations. Josh, where did you get that? Josh! Josh, there is always a better way. Taught me that, and it's true. Josh, you taught me to seek peace , not to be afraid, even death. Violence, anger, revenge , you turn away from Him. You do not want to do this. Josh, thanks to you I am a believer. I believe Jesus died for us. I believe that He protects us and opens way. You believe it too. Do not lose your faith. What is happening? Why are not stopping? As if could not even see us. Would you like to meet the Pastor? Yes Yes, please. Follow me. What about the car? Everything will be provided. Do not worry. Sister Martha. Eat, drink, we have enough. Hmm, where did you get these? Thought you were dead. Hi, nice to meet you , please. What is going on here? I do not know whether to be happy or worried. Rejoice. So the Lord wants us to be. That was before, and it will again. Wow, this is amazing. Are growing very well, but how? 're Back. It seems find what you were looking for. Welcome. 'm Raul, mechanic here. A word was stopped without saying and wandered through the meadow. We're used. He is the Pastor. That's what they say, but for us Bro. George. Always is should be. I do not know how he knows, but he knows. I do not know myself. I have Just a hunch of what I do, and I do. This morning I read and prayed for guidance to reach the coast. Felt the sudden urge to walk towards the highway and there I found Joshua brother and sister Sofia. Know our names. You told me, right? No. Oh, I guess I know them well no more. Brother Raul, please towed the car of brother Josh to camp. I have a hunch. Eh. George? Can you help me kill? I've tried everything. 's Dying. Okay, come back later. Sorry. Probably have many questions. Yes, my mother, Grace, are here? Grace? No one here by that name. How? Eh, no. No, no, that's impossible. It seems to me, is my height. It has 60-odd years. 's Doctor. I know all my people. She is not here. What is this? What do you want? What would you pay? She is here. We heard it was here. Need it. The life of a child is in danger. Sorry. Someone told them that she was here? Who was it? Was it trustworthy? I do not think so. I do not understand. Why would I lie about this? If not here, then where is? J... osh! Josh, look, look! What? That's impossible. How-how did that? How did? Not really know. Pray for the sick things to heal, and they do. Pray for little things to grow, and grow. Gold evil that not approach, and will not come. Can you do that by a person? Yes In the village one girl is dying. Can you help? Knew God had a reason for our meeting. You need something from me and I need something from you. What do you need? Forgive me. Excuse me, I must explain. I was in a coma. For a life of bad decisions drugs, crime, prisons. I was not a nice man. Said he would not wake up, but woke up that day Heard a voice and saw a light, a light still there on the edge of my sight, a chorus that is always pass over my ear, heat... I can almost feel when I reach. Since I woke up, the memories of my life fade and are replaced with visions wonderful Lord. People, Places, Travel wilds of different eras. Saw the deserts of Egypt like I was there. I saw the first temple in Jerusalem. Was like I was sitting at the table with Jesus and his disciples. Remember their faces. Be languages I've never learned. I need your help to continue his call, Josh. I've been here helping people best, waiting for what comes. And last week called came again, desire. Must return to the Holy Land. There is another equally out there somewhere I and together we will meet in Jerusalem and we will see what happens beyond. Do you want a ride Middle East? No, only the coast. God will provide safe conduct from there. But you will pass through the village before para- I doubt that will be so simple, but I will. What time is it? It's almost sundown. I can not believe it. How long were in there? Time moves so rare with brother George. You get used. Have a leak. Not anymore. It became patched. It's a beauty. I can look under the hood? Yeah, well you can. If I had not seen it with my own eyes , I would not have believed. Yes, I do not. Scripture does not say anything about this? Speaks of two witnesses in Revelation. But actually not specify who they are. Just who are prophets with the power of God. Says: are two olive trees and two candlesticks standing before the Lord of the earth. Lord of the earth? Satan, the devil. Should preach to people, the world and his words are like fire y kill anyone who tries to harm them. And then the beast will rise up and destroy. Man and thought I had problems.

Come on. Bring the car. Let's go! Where is she? Where is my mother? Hey, Abner! Here come your way. No one sleeps tonight. No one gets in or out of here for any reason. Do not take your eye off him. Nothing will happen. Do not do this, please. I've seen what he can do, Abner is true. It's not a trick. You have to let go, please. Remember one girl who came to my house to beg willing to do anything looking for a place to live, food. And I gave you a place to live, you and your mother. So you thank me? Where is she? Are you still alive? Will you return to normal? Will you do what I tell you? The ULC surgeons needed after the war. I sent them. To my knowledge, still alive. Sorry, I lied. Was necessary. Joshua?

Can do anything. Yes, but at the right time and for the right reason. Pastor touched me and prayed for me. Is it true that you can heal? Only God can heal, Joshua. The witness is an instrument. By the hand of God through him , what seems impossible can be possible, but the decision is yours. Do I have a choice? There is always an alternative. Means I podra- back to them? Rachel and... And your daughter and her parents. We are waiting. All you have to do is hold my hand. But they need me here. If I do not help them, how can they a-?
