I could take care of him. Have you done that before? No. But I have a dog... Buddy. Oh. Buddy. Oh. Well. You're used to taking care of dogs... and you've done such a great job with Buddy. MILLER. This is a superb idea. Toodles will love it. I'll go get his things from the car. [Giggling] PATRICK. All right. Listen.

Remember. She's a real softie... so don't try to get away with too much. Right? Noah. That goes for you. Too. You can't have ice cream for every meal while we're gone. PATRICK. OK. And let's remember now... Hrandma is not the greatest cook in the world. Please try and be really sensitive. OK... because Grandma tries really. Really hard. ANDREA. We'll eat everything. Dad. Well. Except for the cauliflower cupcakes. [Whimpers] [Coughs] PATRICK. Mom. Ha ha ha! The kids were just saying how much they love your cooking. Very good. Well. I have got a batch... of cauliflower cupcakes ready for the oven. PATRICK. Yummy. Ha ha ha! Andrea. Can you help me out with the bags? Yeah. Sure. Mom. I got all the numbers that you need...
