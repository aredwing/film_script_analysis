You'll lose your job and never find a new one. Give me some coffee, not too hot. I'm always late. Freedom's too important for me... and I hate people who give me advice. - Where's Jeanne? - Downtown. This town and its people bore me. Thanks a lot. I don't mean you... but at times, it all makes me sick. All what? Everything, including me. - Sugar. - Sorry! I'm totally lost. Then do something. Do I let things get me down? Neither do I. I'm thinking. Think less and do more. Look at you. It's a stupid job. No great loss. A chair! Quick! I'll pass out! Claire, it's awful! What? I just saw him! - Who? - Michel. My son! Give me a cognac. I was shopping, and I saw him go by in a car. I knew it. I had a feeling this morning. Roland, you believe in dreams, don't you? I do. Last night I saw him. In my dream, I spilled some rice. That means a visit. Tons of rice! All over the place! When Michel left 7 years ago... he said, "Ma, I'm going to be a father any minute now. "I'm going to seek my fortune." And he left. For 7 years now, not a word from him. Last night, I had a dream, and now... as I came out of the hardware, who went by? Michel. In a gorgeous car right out of a dream. I come in here, and you act as if I'm crazy. - Jeanne. - Crazy. If Michel was here in Nantes, you'd be the first to know. He left home broke. How could he have such a car? By making his fortune! Michel's an honest man. Then I'm crazy. You're telling me! Claire's right. Go on. Insult me. A son would come first to see his mother. You never met him. He's kind. Honest, kind, and perfect. Sure, make him out to be a saint. But you don't abandon your mom and baby. - What baby? - His own. He left his wife, too. He left a poor needy girl who must be a charwoman... slaving to raise his child. Where's my box? Where it belongs. Going to work? Yes, I'm going. One day, I'll go away, too. Still here? What of it? You're lazy. I don't like lazy people. If you meant to hurt me, you have. You're mean, Claire. I'm lucid. The boss asked for you. - What for? - No idea. Wait. Yes, sir, he just came in. The boss is waiting. Yes. No. Impossible. Sit down, Cassard. I'll ring you back. Cassard, this can't go on like this. My dad always used to say... "Punctuality makes perfect." And also... "Success in life means being on time." You'll say you don't care about perfection and success. - Right? - More or less. You're probably intelligent. Don't deny it. But I've observed you, and you have a major fault. You build castles in the air. I do dream a bit. That's bad. Look things square in the face! You've been here three days on a trial basis. In three days, you've been late five times. I don't want excuses. I'm sure you have plenty. "My alarm didn't go off. "I missed my bus." Yes, sir. I'm listening. I was reading this fascinating novel and... Let's see it. It's a great one. It was on my night table for years. Then you understand me. There's a line. On page 15... "There's no dignity nor real life for a man... "who works 12 hours a day... "but knows not for what he works." It's true. I don't know what I'm working for. Fine. Come back and see me once you've found out. Good-bye, my boy. Well? Nothing. We didn't see eye to eye. "Return to Paradise." How are you? No more rehearsing. Music! Champagne! Let's have some fun! Sure, Lola's here. There. I'm glad you came. I was just leaving. Lola, I want to sleep with you again. I don't. Because. I brought you this. Whiskey and cigarettes! That's crazy! That's for your son. You shouldn't have. Thanks, Franky. You don't like me. I do. That's just it. I don't understand. That's how it is. Please. - Hello. - Hi, Mama. Franky brought you this. Hello, Madame Desnoyer. Hello, Cecile. How are you? Upset. Here are your books. A practical joker underlined the killer's name on page 13. It's outrageous. See for yourself. I'm sorry, Madame Desnoyer. As for the other book, it's disgusting. If Cecile had read it, I'd have been mortified. But it's so beautifully written. You usually appreciate style. And what about morality? This Justine girl... she's so stupid. I didn't think you'd be shocked. It's very much in demand. - Hello, Mr. Cassard. - Hello. What would you like? I don't know what to suggest. A book for my daughter. For her last year of school... she has one hour of English a week. Fridays from 4:00 to 5:00. She'd like a dictionary in French and English. A small one. Be quiet. A small one. That's a rather special dictionary. - Not very. - Pardon? It's very useful for learning English. True, but I'll have to order one. Never what we want. Cecile, please! It's true, but I don't care. Excuse me, but I couldn't help overhearing. I have such a dictionary, if you wish... You're too kind, but we couldn't accept. Mr. Cassard's one of my best customers. Roland Cassard. I don't mean to be a bother, but, yes, I'll accept it. Say "thank you." Thank you, sir. I had a childhood friend named Cecile. You look like her. I lost track of her after the war. Your name made me think of her. You look so much like her, I feel ten years younger. How curious. Indeed. I'm glad to be of help. When may I deliver it? No need to do that. My daughter and I can... I have plenty of time. We live at 10 rue de Calvaire. Madame Desnoyer. This evening at 7:00? - Gladly. - Good. Thank you again. Come on, Cecile. Sacha Distel. Not today. They're charming. I look awful. You're the most beautiful girl I've ever known. Really? You have charm, grace, and beauty. You're in love. I'm always in love. I'm engaged in the States. Where were you before? Before what? Before the Navy. I worked for Dad in Chicago. What's he do? He's in lifts. You know, for going up. Airplanes? Sputniks? No, not sputniks. Never mind. Maybe I'll work for him again when I get home in three months. And get married? You look so much like him. Who? A guy that I loved a lot. American? French. Are you jealous? No, I'm not jealous. Tomorrow we're sailing for Cherbourg. Our leave's over. And then? Back to the States. Coming back to France? Maybe. I don't know. Come on. I must take the boy to school, and I'm late. Why are you looking at me that way? No reason. Just looking. I'll come say good-bye tomorrow. If you want to. What's wrong? It's broken. I'll buy you a new one. I want a trumpet. You'll get one. Come on. Come on, Yvon. The dictionary. It was here this morning. Where did I put it? Here. It's odd. - I lost my job. - Surprised? No, but I'm broke. Can you loan me? Here. I'm big-hearted. I'm hungry. - Butter? - Sure. I didn't see you. That's pretty. It's a seascape. Is your son back? No, it wasn't him. I'd have bet my right arm it was him. You're lucky you didn't. You'd never have painted again. Silly! I've made up my mind. I'm leaving. I saw a Gary Cooper movie this afternoon. It was beautiful. The people seemed happy. Where? At the Ritz. I meant what country? Matareva... A Pacific island near Tahiti. It's always beautiful. - What? - In the movies. So is life. Here, we don't know how to live anymore. Me and my boss, you and your drunks. You know how to live? I'll learn. By traveling? It's the only remedy for me. - For what? - Boredom. You should get married. And have lots of kids. With six kids to feed, you'd have no time for boredom. You'll never understand me. We're too stupid. What's that? A dictionary. Jeanne knows how to live... by killing time with her daubing. You call that daubing? Sorry. Your works. With them you manage to kill time. I have no works to create. I'm lost. Totally lost. I'm bored to death. Forgive me. Play the violin. And Teresa? Finished, like the violin. Make new friends. I had a pal, but he got rubbed out. So everything's fine. Really want to leave? It's possible? Maybe. Favigny at the shoe store... was looking for someone. - Me, selling shoes... - Let me finish. It's no doubt too late. It was something about a hairdresser. Did you hear him, Jeanne? I listened hard. I didn't pretend. - It's serious? - I think so. Ask for Mr. Valentine at the barber's in the Arcade... and say Favigny sent you. Do you know Favigny? Maybe. But barbering or shoes... Just go and find out. Watch where you're going. Sorry. Did I hurt you? No, but... Roland! Pardon me? Don't you recognize me? Cecile! This is crazy. Of all things. I hurt you? I thought of you only this morning! And I mentioned you, too. I met a young girl who looks like you used to. I'm surprised. I'm trembling. It's like a chill. I'm so happy. I got lipstick on you. It's been ten years? More. Since after the war. I didn't recognize you. You haven't changed. - Really? - Barely. Going which way? That way. Yvon, come here. My son. Say hello. - Married? - Sort of. I'm glad to see you! Feel my heart. It's pounding so. - And you? - What? - Married? - No. It's odd we never met. I left town years ago. I travel a lot. I'm a dancer. I work all over. I just got here three days ago. What time is it? I must go. Yvon! Look at my hands. Can't you keep still? I didn't have time to dress. I've got a run. I must see you again. Anytime. I'm in a hurry. I must take him to school. Are you free tonight? Yes. At 8:00. In front of the theater. OK. I'm so thrilled! I put lipstick on you? Mr. Valentine. He's not in. Mr. Favigny sent me. I'll go see. It's personal. Mr. Favigny sent me about the job. What job? He said you were looking for someone. True. What kind of job? Don't ask questions. Are you free? If not, I wouldn't be here. Follow me. It involves a trip. Or several trips... if you fill the bill. You'd have to leave Nantes in two days... on Saturday. OK. You'll sail on the Duchess Ann. The captain will be informed. Destination... Amsterdam. You'll then fly to Port Elizabeth. Let me finish. There a friend will drive you to Johannesburg. You'll give him this briefcase. He'll give you a similar one in return. You'll bring it back here. That's all? That's all. It's a fairy tale. You'll accept? Give me 24 hours. That's too long. I suggest you say "yes." And if I tell the police? It'd be a mistake. I accept. Here's your passport as Jean Maillard. Put your photo in it. The Duchess Ann's captain will stamp it. Here's an advance. And the briefcase? Come for it tomorrow. One thing more... I don't know you. You don't know me. I'm exhausted! Shopping drives me crazy. All the people and cars. Mr. Cassard's nice. Everyone is, except for some people. You must not think this whole world's rotten. Some people deserve our trust. Some are good, even if their looks can be deceiving. Clothes don't make the man. Don't fidget. You tire me out. He has a nice face. He talks nicely. I wonder what he does for a living. Cecile, bring me my slippers. After all, he doesn't have to deliver your book. It's very nice of him. Remember to thank him. We could invite him to dinner. That's one way to get to know him. But is it necessary? What do you think? You say nothing. What are you doing? Nothing, Mama. Turn off the radio. And my slippers? I must always repeat myself 50 times. I'm sure you haven't written your uncle yet. You know how susceptible he is. If your father were still alive... What's wrong? You always complain. It's for your own good. I'm not a child. I'll be 14 tomorrow. You're an angel. It's Mr. Cassard. Let him in. He must not see me like this. It's Susan. Susan? Hurry up. Loan me your books. Not now. We're expecting a guest. Wait. Madame Desnoyer? Yes. Cecile! Come in. Here's your book. You're very kind. Not at all. May I keep it? As long as you wish. Hot damn! Such vulgar language. I won't say it again. You speak English? At times. We just got in. Please don't mind the mess. Mr. Cassard speaks English at times. I once went to the States with my father. I was only five, but I've studied since then. Have you studied a lot? Not very much. I went to work young. My parents were poor. They were divorced early. He was a sailor. She was always waiting for him. One day she quit waiting and married a railwayman... but he was never home either. I'd love to travel. I'm sorry. I must go. I have a date with that childhood friend... whom Cecile resembles. How amusing! I just ran into her. You recognized each other? She recognized me. She's beautiful. Maybe I'll be like her. Maybe. She's a dancer. See, Mama? Just what I want to be. Childish fancies. She'll change her mind. You must come again. Are you free for dinner Saturday? That's impossible. I'm going away on a job again... and Saturday, I'll be off the coast of Cherbourg. What a small world. My brother-in-law is a barber there. Look. Put that picture back. You were a dancer? No, it was for a masquerade. Or dinner tomorrow for Cecile's 14th birthday? Tomorrow? With pleasure. Until tomorrow! He's charming, isn't he? I'm hungry. Yes. Set the table. Cecile, answer me. One day, I'll be a dancer. Meanwhile, set the table. What will we eat? With all this, I forgot about dinner. But I'm hungry. Go buy some eggs... some fruit, and whatever you want. Apples and pears. Give me some money. I'll buy my Meteor comics, too. Just remember to give me the change. Meteor comics, please. Help yourself. They're all gone. He took the last one. Pick another one. Can't I read what I want? Sure. Take it. I don't know you. Please. If you insist. Want it? "Let's land on this odd planet." A moment later, the spaceship landed. "Where are we?" Asked the professor. "Is this planet inhabited?" I think it is. So do I. Good. The fair! I'm going with Susan. Who's she? A friend in my class. Do you understand me? Yes. I'm learning French. I'm learning English. America's almost the same. Talk and see if I understand you. Nothing! But I'm only a beginner. I had one hour of it on Friday... but I'll learn fast. Besides, a man we met... brought me a dictionary. How old are you? I'm a minor. I'll be 14 tomorrow. My sister in Chicago is 14. She speaks French? She's learning. Later, she'll be a teacher. I wouldn't want to do that. I want to be a dancer, but Mama says no. But I don't care. Darn! Now I'll catch it. I forgot to buy the eggs. My name's Cecile. What's yours? Franky came by to see you. - What did he say? - Nothing. Do you love him? Franky? You only love once. For me, it's over. I like him a lot. He's leaving tomorrow. Their ship's been overhauled. They're going to Cherbourg. Pity. They're cute. Daisy, loan me your lipstick. I can't find mine. I have to rehearse. Not that one. It doesn't suit me. Anyone got a lipstick? Catch. Thanks. Where's your kid? In school. School's important, right? Biancini phoned. He's offering two months in Marseilles. Interested? Biancini? No. You go to Marseilles... and end up in Argentina. No. It's for real. He needs an answer by tomorrow. Nelly? I'll think it over. Helene? I'm going to Paris. Pretty. Where did you get that? I altered my black corset. Recognize it? It's gorgeous! I should sew fancy stuff on the top of mine. Something fancy, you know? With some glitz here... and a plume like Marilyn Monroe's. But I have no time. Naturally. Why "naturally"? I want to rehearse. Can I have some music? What are you doing? Stringing some beads. It's me... Lola The one who laughs at anything And says love's a lovely thing Wins men's hearts without fear And gives without a tear To older guys or brave young men Is always asking where or when Likes to please them every day Without going all the way It's me... Lola I see a ship tied to a buoy Then I meet a sailor boy We sing and we dance We play with romance We whirl and we spin Then I say with a grin That I mean no, it's time to go That's enough, don't get rough It's me... Lola I say, oh, please come back Then I smile behind your back But I'm lost on a dream One that's not a scheme It's all peaches and cream He'll take me in his arms and show me That out of thousands, he will know me You, you It's me... Lola What time is it? I must run. I have a date at 8:00. With Franky? No. A guy I hadn't seen in 15 years! I happened to run into him. A drink before you go? I don't have time. I washed my hair. It's all silky! I came to take you to dinner. I got a date. Alone? I lost the other guys. I looked on the docks and in town. I can't find them. I'll see you tonight. Am I late? No. It's just 8:00. I thought I'd never get here. What a day. I had to rehearse and then pick up the kid at school. Time flies. Hold my mirror. Thanks. I must be a mess. Like that. Thanks. You always have to look attractive. What'd you do? I got fired, went to a movie, and met you. - That's too bad. - Meeting you? - Losing your job. - Not really. My trumpet. Later. The store's closed. Never contradict a child. Is that better? - Where will we go? - Anywhere you want. We'll go to my place. I'll put him to bed and change shoes. These are killing me. Then we'll go to a quiet place. OK. It's a furnished place. I used to have Mom's apartment till she got evicted and died. Saying she died of eviction sounds funny, but it's true. Make yourself at home. Yvon, hurry up. Fix yourself a drink. I'll be with you in a sec. Want a whiskey? The Americans gave it to me. You should come see me dance at the El Dorado. I've got a pretty good number. Want some, Cecile? No, I hate it. I'm laughing because no one calls me Cecile anymore. Everyone calls me by my stage name... Lola. Put on a record. And my trumpet? You'll get one. Said your prayers? Yes, Mama. I hate leaving him alone... but not as much as when he was younger. I didn't dare to leave him. Cheers. I didn't recognize you in makeup. Is it too much? No, just odd. It's necessary for my work. And I like to look attractive. I'll put on a dress. Last time I saw you, you had pigtails. I must have looked hideous. I was about 10 or so. Tell me about yourself. Me... Now that you don't travel, what do you do? I'm going on a trip. Like before? Remember how you went on and on about the States? What have you done for ten years? A little of everything. Is the back all right? I sold lighters, washers, curling irons, ties... and even life insurance. - Out of laziness or what? - It's not that. I was ambitious. Now you're not? I think I'm a perfect failure. I daydream. I'm lost and bored. You've changed. Do you still play the violin? I quit during the war. When I tried to start again, I'd forgotten everything. Then I had to make a living. So I sold lighters. It's no excuse. I simply lacked courage. At times I regret it. You might have been a great violinist. I played badly. And the damn war. I was also in love with you. You're just talking. I'm serious. But I kept it to myself. That was nice. Shall I wear my jacket? I guess I will. Go to sleep, darling. Kids go to sleep at once, but they take up so much space. With him here, my life's changed. You'll find that out, too. - I doubt it. - Why? - Kids aren't a necessity. - Don't you like them? Sure, but having a child is serious business. People usually have them by accident. Only a child that's wanted is really happy. You weren't wanted? Not exactly. We often think that, but it's not true. Life's great, isn't it? Yes, but what we do with it isn't always great. Was he an accident? Sort of. We could eat here, but it's so complicated. - I'll take you to a restaurant. - I'd love to! As a kid, I dreamt of being tall and well-built... and of being a dancer, at the Opera, of course. I took the wrong road somewhere along the road. But I have no regrets. I was happy once. It was during Carnival. There was a fair with rides. A tall guy appeared. He was big and blond... well-built. He was dressed like an American sailor... with a white cap. It was my 14th birthday. I fell madly in love with him. Love at first sight. Then he left, and I didn't see him for ages. But I never stopped thinking about him. I thought he'd forgotten me, but one day he came back. It was Whitsunday. He took me to the seashore. His name was Michel. That's when the "accident" happened. When I said I was pregnant, he disappeared. Bastard! Maybe not. He was very sweet. I didn't know him very well, but he was nice. He said he'd make a dancer out of me. Maybe I'm not a great dancer, but I'm a good mother. I think he'll come back. I can't believe he's abandoned me. He was so kind. He couldn't bear the idea... of having a child and being unable to raise him properly. You must think I'm crazy. Give me a cigarette. I'm out. Wait. Take me home before I go to work. If you wish. Why'd he leave you if he loved you? He had a sudden chance for a fine job in the colonies. He was to come back soon, but he didn't. If he did, you'd be disappointed. Not necessarily. I bet he's boring... smokes a pipe, and plays the stock market. And he's fat and bald. What's wrong? Funny. I never thought of him like that. Sleeping like a log. He looks so much like his father. Maybe that's why I can't forget him. Try. Look at me. I've lived like a fool. Ten years ago, I gave up, out of fatigue or boredom. Now I'm leaving again. We mustn't let things get us down. You met a slob, but other guys exist. Maybe one's waiting for you. Don't worry about me so much. I'm just a silly girl who's boring you with sob stories. But I was glad to see you. I know it's no fun for you. I'm furious with myself, but it's over. Going far? Johannesburg. The ends of the earth. Pity. You could have cheered me up. I'll be back. Does it happen often? That I feel blue? No, don't misjudge me. I'm usually very cheerful. I hate moaning sob sisters. But tonight with you and my memories... it's all crashed down on me. It's silly. Maybe he'll come back. I'm sure he will. One's first love is so strong. I must run! I go on at midnight! Are my eyes red? Come with me if you want. I don't feel like it. - You'll come say good-bye? - Sure. Everyone to bed. I want to sleep at your place. Go to a hotel with your pals. I'm broke. Besides, I don't like drunks. And I feel sad. I'm leaving tonight. We'll never meet again. I brought this. Your son asked me for it. OK, but promise me you'll behave. - Promise? - I promise. - What an early bird. - Coffee. You look bad. Are you ill? No. It was a nice night. I had a walk until dawn. - Sure. - What? - You slept out. - Maybe you did, too. Seen Valentine? Thanks. It's a shady deal. A trip to Amsterdam and Johannesburg. Why shady? A mysterious deal with a briefcase. An ordinary leather briefcase with a handle... which I'm to take through customs without being noticed. You accepted? Yes, but I've changed my mind about leaving. Why? Why look elsewhere for what's on your own doorstep? What have you found? Love, I think. - What? - He's found love. At his age. So life's wonderful again? Yes. - But he's about to act silly. - Silly? He has a job to go to Amsterdam and... Johannesburg, but no. - Well... - Isn't it true? Yes and no. Where's Johannesburg? South Africa. It's a mess. The sky's run into the sea. It looks like a melted candle. - And my coffee? - Coming up. People look great this morning. Love suits you. I feel like running up and kissing them. Go ahead. Take her with you to Johannesburg. Impossible. She loves you? She doesn't even know I love her. Here. For yesterday's loan. No hurry. The barber's closed? - You, too? - What? - You're a cop? - Why? Two detectives came by, and I told them what I thought. I watched him for two years. Quick. Already up and dressed. Look what Franky brought you. Leave it for later. Put your shoes on. Leave it alone. Come on. You? Leaving today? No. I came by to bring this to Yvon. What is it? A trumpet. He'll like that. - What is it? - A trumpet. - I got one. - Now you'll have two. Come on. I'm taking him to school. I can barely sleep. I haven't slept yet. We had some sailors on leave who wouldn't leave. Such noise and music. I think I'll sleep all day. Yvon, stop dragging your feet. What's wrong with you? Me? Nothing. Do you need money? Not at all. You do but you don't dare to ask? It's not that. Something else? Here we are. You can't take your trumpet to school. It's private and run by two up-to-date old ladies. They feed him and do everything. He can't go to a municipal one because I travel a lot. You won't say what's wrong? Never mind. I wanted to tell you I'm not leaving. Why? Because I love you. That's silly. I love you and I have for ages. I already liked you in the past. After seeing you again, something's changed. I walked all night. I thought of our childhood. All sorts of memories came back to me. You're at the center of them all. I've lived on dreams till now. That was wrong. You give a meaning to my life. You're not very happy. I'll work and help you. I'm not worth much, but I could be a nice guy. - Impossible! - I can do it. I know you could, but it's best to be frank. I don't love you, Roland. I know I can always count on you... and I'll always try to help you... but I don't love you. I never dreamt you thought of me... as anything more than a friend. We barely know each other. Let's call it love at first sight. At 16, yes, but we're not 16 anymore. You just want to sleep with me. Of course I do. But I want the feeling to be mutual. Mad at me? I'm not mean. I try never to hurt people... but I do, in spite of myself. And yet, I'd like everyone to be happy. What are you waiting for? Michel. He's the one I love. Michel and the American. What American? The one I saw you with this morning. Spying on me? You didn't try to hide. Of course not. I don't deserve this! I thought you were a friend. I've never had a friend, just guys chasing after me. But I'm nobody special. I feel miserable. I feel so tired. If you knew how tired I am, you wouldn't torment me so. Calm down. Besides, I'm going away. I'm leaving town. With him? Who? The American? Yes, the American. I'm going to America. Then the tale about Michel was just a bluff? Yes. Like you say, just a bluff. And I was going to stay here and refuse a great job. Why? For a whore who goes off with the first guy she meets! Roland! I'm sorry. I'm going to bed. I'm tired, too. Let me explain. I don't need any explanation. I'll soon forget you. Leaving? The others are waiting for me. Did you sleep? A little. Did I make you cry? Not you. Go on now. I liked you a lot. Farewell, Franky. Girls School The American. - Know him? - He's my friend. Here's the Meteor Susan borrowed. I've dropped everything. - It's yours. - I don't want it. How's your English? It's getting better. If my teacher sees me with you, I'll be in trouble. I'll never hear the end of it. A girlfriend got expelled... because a boy came for her each day and brought her candy. Come on! I'm talking! That's Susan. She sticks like glue. Go without me! How do you say "anniversaire"? Birthday. Today's my birthday. Want to go to the fair? - Bye, Cecile. - I'll never see you again? Yes, if you come to Chicago. That's sad. I'm taking the train tonight with them. Tonight, St. Nazaire; Sunday, Cherbourg; then America. I hate leaving you. Bye, little girl. Where were you? What's happened to your hair? Nothing. If I hadn't had dinner to fix, I'd have gone to your school. I'm always afraid for you. About what? Not your homework now. Mr. Cassard's due any moment. Where were you? School ended two hours ago. Talking to Susan. She wants to be a hairdresser like Uncle Aim. What an idea. It's a good profession. - What are you making? - An onion pie. I'll never learn it. After school, I saw Franky. The American sailor I told you about. A sailor? - What's that about? - I did nothing wrong. Stay away from all servicemen. And the others, too, for now. - He was nice. - All the more reason. Why "was"? He's gone. He helped me get a good grade in English. He increased my vocabulary. Know how Americans say "anniversaire"? We went to the fair with Susan. The fair! With a man you don't even know! My daughter with a serviceman! And you get home at 7:00. And me, sick with worry. Put your things away and set the table. Such a fuss because I was five minutes late. It's not because you're late. I try to be pals with you, and look what happens. Forks left, knives right. I've told you a hundred times. Don't cry. I'm not. Where's your sailor from? Chicago, Illinois. A Chicago sailor. You and your geography. Chicago has no sailors... only gangsters. - You exaggerate. - I know what I'm saying. A dancer. A sailor's girl. If you have a child, it's for a lifetime. I like children. It's Cassard! We just met, and our first meal is a farewell dinner. Why are you leaving? Certain events which I prefer to keep secret... have radically changed my monotonous life. I have no reason to stay here. It's none of my business. It must be serious. A woman. Probably an unfaithful one. I have no right to judge her. She lives with the memory of her first love. A first love is so strong. - But... - Why, Mama? Just because. You were saying... She's going away with an American. I met an American. Stop interrupting. You're too young for this conversation. My daughter goes out with Americans. Just one. That's worse. Where did you meet? At the tobacco shop. - Why were you there? - To buy Meteor. No, I don't smoke. But why not? Just this once... - Me, too. - You're awful. When are you leaving? I sail tomorrow. Why'd he say a first love is so strong? Explain it to her. She's always asking me questions. Because it's the first time and it rarely happens again. If it does, it's not the same. - It's not as good? - It's different. Then we shouldn't miss the boat. Your button's about to fall off. I'll sew it back on for you. She's unbearable. She's right. I'd have lost it. It's so hard for a woman to raise a child alone. I'm alone. I lost everything during the war... my mother, my house, furniture, books, my husband. Nothing was left... not a handkerchief nor a sheet. Overnight I was a penniless widow. My husband was a gambler. He had every vice. God save us from gamblers. Do you gamble? I should have married a man like you. So I moved to Cherbourg to stay at my brother-in-law's. I stayed two years. Cecile was born there. But I loathed Cherbourg, so I moved here. - There you are, sir. - Thank you, miss. - More cake? - No. I must go. Already? I have a lot to do before I leave. Cecile, come say good-bye. I'm sorry I wasn't more cheerful. We'll be lonely without you. Farewell. Forgetting anything? Bon voyage. I sail at 1:00. I saw the captain. I have my passport. Here's my key. Do as you please with whatever I've left up there. - And your love story? - It's over. It wasn't very serious. It was, but it doesn't matter now. You got over it fast. One does one's best. It took me 25 years. Yes, a first love is so strong. How do you know? So I was told. But my first love is long gone. I'll go see Valentine and pick up my bag later. Keep moving! Go on! What's up? Diamond smuggling at the barber's. Can you imagine? Diamonds. Go on. There's nothing to see. - Remember what I said? - Yes. I was looking for you, to say good-bye. I couldn't leave with you mad at me. Forgive me. I was dumb and mean yesterday. I didn't mean what I said. I said just anything, and I'm sorry. I know you live as best as you can... and it's not easy. I wish you lots of happiness. I wanted to share it with you. I wanted you to know... I wanted to tell you I lied. Lied? I'm not leaving with the American. With whom? No one. I'm leaving alone. With Yvon. The American... I slept with him because he reminded me of Michel. Maybe it was due to the uniform... but I didn't love him. He's gone, and I'll never see him again. So why'd you make it all up? I was so confused. I didn't expect to see you. I couldn't hurt you. I thought it would be best... if I said I was going with someone else. Smart. Not very. It may not mean much to you... but I didn't want you to think badly of me... nor that I'm a whore who runs off... with any guy who comes along. I'm sorry. I've accepted a two-month job in Marseilles. You'll leave for Marseilles and end up in Argentina. I said exactly the same thing. No, it's a real job. So Michel's not a bluff? No, he's the only guy I've ever loved. If he returns, I may be disappointed... but not mad at myself. I'll have waited for him like a good girl. And if he doesn't come? I don't know. I do. You'll have ruined your life. I've thought a lot about the two of us. But it doesn't matter. It's not our fault. Life's like that. We're alone and we stay alone. But what counts is to want something... no matter what the cost is. There's a bit of happiness in simply wanting happiness. I wanted nothing until I saw you again. But now... You're right. It's great to be alive. You think I should kiss you and thank you. - It'd be a miracle. - It may happen. Roland, we're not kids. Let's part as friends. We mustn't rush things. We've both led different lives. You'll be gone how long? I don't know. The guy who hired me just got arrested. So I'll go and I'll manage when I get there. The main thing is to leave. I'll return in two months. We must think it over. Maybe, if you really love me... Do you doubt it? No, I think you're sincere. Two months isn't forever. It's two wasted months. Smile at me. Better than that. - Have you heard? - What? Cecile's gone to her uncle's in Cherbourg. - It's awful. - Don't exaggerate. She left this note on the table. Read it. After you left, she made a scene. Everyone's leaving? Me, too. School's boring. I'll learn to be a hairdresser at my uncle's. And she began to cry. I said to myself, tomorrow she'll forget all this. This morning she was gone. She wanted to be a dancer, not a hairdresser. We should never contradict children. I'm in a terrible position. My brother-in-law is her father. So? I never told her. That's silly. - Really? - Of course. I haven't seen him in ten years, but he writes constantly. I'm undecided. I'll go to Cherbourg at once. You're not leaving? - What time is it? - 12:20. My ship sails at 1:00. I'll miss my train! Anybody here? Coming! Can I help you? - Don't you know me? - What? Don't you recognize me? Michel. Jeanne, come quick! You've killed her. - You exaggerate. - And you? Get some vinegar and a towel! You could have at least spared your mother. I'm not here to be scolded. - She's breathing. - Of course. Michel, my son. - She can talk. - It's nothing. - Don't move. - I'm not dying. I've got great news. - Not again! - Let him talk. Mama, I'm rich. You hear me? Rich! I'm not deaf. That's all you can say? There are other riches. Never mind her. Tell me everything. I've come back to get married. My wife and child are waiting for me. After seven years? You're dreaming. - Some welcome. - Is she here? She dances at the El Dorado. A dancer? Look after Mama. - You're leaving? - I have things to do. Michel's come back for his wife... a dancer. A dancer. That's all I needed. He hasn't changed. I knew him at once. I passed out. It's silly to be so emotional. I'll get my bag. Leaving? Stay to see Michel and meet his wife. I don't have the time. - We'll see you soon? - I'm not coming back to France. Bye, my little chickie. If ever you need us, we'll be here. Thank you. Bye, kitten. We'll miss you. Come see me. Bye, treasure. - Be careful. - I'm not crazy. Bye, angel. - You'll see Marseilles. - I'll think of you. Bye, my little bug. - Send us a postcard? - Sure. Bye, darling. Come back and see us. Hurry, Lola. You'll miss your train. Looking for someone? Cecile. It's Michel! Your son. Yvon, kiss your father. A son. He looks like you. Don't just stand there. I was so afraid you wouldn't come back. Seven years. Can you imagine? If you knew how I've waited and thought about you. At times the memory of you made my life miserable. I tried to forget you, but I couldn't. - Forgive me. - I doubted you so. I wanted to come back, but I couldn't. I was broke on an island on Matareva in the Pacific. I thought about you constantly. I couldn't do a thing. Time passed. I thought, "She's forgotten me." Then slowly my life changed. I regained my confidence... but I didn't dare come back to France to see you. I've been here three days... wandering around town. Today I made my decision. If you want... if you still love me... Bye, Lola. Music! Champagne! Let's have some fun! What's wrong? Nothing. SkyFury
