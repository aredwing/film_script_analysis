Now, you're black for life, my son. Black and proud of it. And don't let anyone diminish you. Will you teach me how to fight, master? I've been learning Capoeira for 50 years. To teach you all of it, it will take another 50 years. Come here, who taught you how to walk? - My mom and my dad. - No, Manoel. Your body taught you how to walk. You've started walking here and there... Manoel, leave that beetle alone! People don't realize this beetle can fly. He's heavy and his wings are thin. Even science is sure this beetle can't fly, but... Iook how wonderful it is. When the boy's eyes lit up watching that beetle, as black as himself, but having the ability to fly, he made a choice. The choice to fight for his people. And he stopped being Manoel to become Besouro. Besouro Golden belt A JOO DANIEL TIKHOMIROFF FILM Besouro A JOO DANIEL TIKHOMIROFF FILM Golden Belt Recncavo Baiano, Brazil abolished slavery less than 40 years ago, and black people are still treated as slaves. African religions are restrained and Capoeira is outlawed. Black people start to get organized to demand their rights. At the Recncavo Master Alpio is the leader of the black community. Due to his struggle, Master Alpio is sworn to death and gets protection from Capoeira fighters and his main protg, Besouro. JANUARY 21, 1924 - Good morning, Master Alpio. - Good morning. Go for it, Besouro! Besouro, shouldn't you be protecting Master Alpio? Good morning, master. - 'Morning. - How do you do? We can't rely on you, man. Don't stop the music. Come on, play it. Let's practice. - Good morning, master. - Good morning. Hi, boys. Do it. You're so handsome! Come on. Let's go. Yes, sir. Very good! Besouro! Besouro! Besouro! Master Alpio isn't home. Master? - Master? - Master! Besouro, take me to the old slave house. Just you. It was my fault, master. This was bound to happen. No, master. I chose you... to continue... what I started. Colonel... Noca, move this filth off of my way. Genival and Serafim, get him out of here. - Moron, bastard. - Amaro, serve me a dose. That's a nice berimbau. It belongs to Dinor. You'll end up marrying her. We always liked each other, Chico. Since we were kids. Since you were called "Z", Besouro was "Manoel", and Dinor was a tomboy playing over there in the mud. That's your opinion. For me, she's always been gorgeous. She looked like a goddess... with her curly hair. How about Besouro? What about him? He must be in great pain. We all are. The people, and all of us. But Besouro even more. He knows what he's done. Besouro... what a proud fella. Will Besouro come to the master's tribute? He'd better not. Master Alpio here's my lament Pray for our bonding's strength You taught us to be proud And to have no fear at all Our race's greatness Capoeira bonds us all Set free Our hearts Go. - Master Alpio, here's my lament - Let's go. - For our master. - Pray for our bonding's strength You taught us to be proud And to have no fear at all Our race's greatness Capoeira bonds us all Set our hearts free And to have no fear at all Enough of this, bunch of lowlifes! It's forbidden to fight in these domains! Get out of here. Everybody quiet! I thought you were a literate man, Noca de Antnia. Who said this is fighting? Capoeira is a dance. Look who's talking! It's the fish stinking nigger! Is it a dance, fish stench? Your leaps and mummeries are a dance? - Then you're forbidden to dance. - Under whose orders? - Who? - I will show you. Beat up the niggers! Go! Go! Go! Run! What are you thinking? That your dance scares us? Your make-believe fight? These niggers are just pretenders! They came up with Capoeira to scare cowards off! Are you performing a Gathering? Are you wearing the old man's shoes? In a nigger's grave - we can fit 2 or 3. - Fuck off, Noca. Fuck off. - Big man with a gun! - This? There you go, I'm unarmed. Now I'll disarm you so we'll know who's brave. You are wasting your time, Noca. I don't carry a gun. You have a different kind of gun, nigger. Dance now, nigger. Let's go. Hold on tight, Chico. Olorum Ojubar. Ossaim Ojubar. Hold on, Chico. Hold on, you're strong. Chico, soon the pain will fade away. Let us practice, let us practice. The Blessing, the Cartwheel, the Warned, the Half-Moon in a Compass. The Hammer kick... You're getting good, Quero-Quero. You're getting good. Let's practice. - Master, may I practice? - Yes, Dinor. - Yes. - That one? - No! - Off course you can. Let's practice. Hold on, Quero-Quero. Hold on, hold on. Get up, Besouro. What's going on? You must learn something. Alone, you can be strong and brave, but two are stronger. And three, even stronger. Together we are very strong. And don't let anything split you up. Anything. Noca is a coward. If the master was here, this wouldn't have happened. He knew how to make them respect us. That's true. Besouro screwed up, honey. It wasn't his fault. May I walk you home? There's no need for that. I need to be alone for a while. To think about what's going on. I'm going to take care of you. Take care of yourself. Clear the way! Let's go! Go! Let's go! Get to work! Put the millstone in gear. Come on! People are saying after the old man died he ran to the forest. Why did he leave? He yellowed. The black man turned yellow. Everything is alright now. There are no more Gatherings and no more berimbau playing. The niggers are carrying loads and pulling rigs now. Everything is quiet now. Much too quiet. Come in. Close the door. Don't be afraid, Besouro. You were supposed to take care of the master. But you were showing off. You want me to defend the city from the colonel? I'm not ready yet, Dinor. You'll never be ready. You are ready to meet the one who will show you the way. Chico, that's Exu's offering. Didn't you see what just happened to Master Alpio? Don't you know fighting is banned? It wasn't the fighting, mom. It was because of his ideas. I'll go ahead to start working on the kitchen, OK? - I'll pick up the rest of the stuff. - OK. Blessings, lady. God bless you, sweetie. I'd like some of that strong pepper. This one burns like fire. Jesus, Zulmira, what's wrong? - Howdy. - Howdy. Alright? - Good morning. - Good morning. Look, Zulmira, Besouro is back. When did you catch that fish? Early today. It's very fresh. How about you? Are you very fresh? Are you looking for trouble this early? Who's that fella over there with Chico? What fella? What are you doing, man? What are you doing? You can't do that in my fish stand. - Drop my fish, man. - As you wish. You bastard! What will you do now? What's going on with Chico? Are you a man or a mouse? I'm going to kill you! How will you kill what can't die? Vicious bastard! Where is he? Where is he? Bastard. Bastard, where are you? Where are you? Where? Bastard! Where are you? He is hiding. - I'll get you, bastard. - Calm down, Chico. - Go away. - Put the knife down. - Calm down, Chico. - You came here to annoy me. - Calm down, Chico. - I'm going to help you. - Calm down, boy. - Relax. - What's going on? - Give me the knife. - What's going on? - Stop this nonsense. Are you talking to yourself? Are you talking to yourself? Are you crazy? - Let's go home. - Come here. Who are you? I'm Exu. I'm good to whoever is good to me, and evil to those who don't respect me. I ruled over your master's head for a long time. My master was a good man, he wasn't indebted to you. Is there good without evil? Is there death without life? Master Alpio was aware of that. What do you want from me? Respect. Kneel before me. I ain't kneeling. I'm neither yours nor anybody's slave. Jesus! What were you doing that day? Were you beside him? Were you protecting him? Who are you to blame me? - What's gotten into Besouro? - Something is wrong. - Is he crazy? Let's go, Dinor. - I'm not moving. You're vain. You're arrogant. You let Alpio die. Come on, Besouro, wake up! Wake up! Get him! Run! Run! Come on, run! Shoot him! Shoot him! Run! Run, you bastards! Get him! Come on! Shoot the damn nigger! Shoot him! Fire! Fire! Shoot the bastard! Get him, come on! - Get the nigger! - Get him! Let's climb here! - Here! - There, get him! Shoot him! - Shoot! - Shoot him. The damn nigger sunk. He ran like a cavy, but I think we hit him, colonel. Do you? No one can survive that height, colonel. From that height? No way, no how. Some people ruin everything, but thank God some people work too. Isn't it so? Genival, hold it there. Go, lift it, lift it. No drunken ruffian, stupid and hoodlum will ruin the people's market. - Did you hear that, Noca? - Yes, I did, colonel. - Now go! - Let's go. Let's go, let's go. Lift it up. Let's go, Genival, help lift it up. Hold it there, nio. Come on. Let's help the colonel. We'll do it, Coronel. Ogum i, patacori Ogum. Orixs are the forces of nature. Ossain, Lord of leaves. He's the Orix who knows the secrets of healing and the mystery of life. Besouro, you're the offspring of Ogum, the ruler of war. Ogum i, my father! Oxum is loving, vain and alluring. She's the Orix of fresh water. She's maternal and overprotective. Lans is the beautiful and brave Orix. There's no better companion in battle. Besouro, you have a mission. Are you alright? I dreamt with my master. He was talking... about a war. Capoeira alone - won't rid anyone from evil. - About a mission... from Ogum. This is for your protection. It was laid to sleep at Ogum's feet. There are 7 leaves which will open your 7 doors and close your enemies' doors. Your body is shielded. That nigger is evil. And evil must be nipped in the bud. I think even black folk are mad at him. Good afternoon, colonel. Noca. - Shameful race! - Get to work, bastard! Move, devil's hoof! Now, - you better keep your eyes open. - They are wide open, colonel. Indeed they are. Fire! Fire! It's on fire! - It's spreading! - Put it out! Put it out! Don't let it spread! - Run! - Put it out! Who's done this? Put it out! Serafim, fetch water. Put it all out. Who's done this? Come on, run! Noca, I saw who set the sugar cane plantation on fire. It was Besouro. It's all surrounded, colonel. - Who's on top Jacu hill? - "Ugly" Joo and 15 more. Who's at the sandbank? Neno, Z do Toti and his gang. - Who's at the river's head? - The rest of the gang. I think the nigger is there. You're a menace. Will you get me a chicken, daughter? Will you? Look what you did to my chicken! - I'm sorry. - It's alright. What are you doing there? Move over there. Let's go! Go. There was nothing I could do, Congressman. The damage was huge. I sold a herd of oxen to make up for the lost sugar cane. And forced the niggers to produce twice as much. I'm going to need your help at the capital. And to where has the nigger gone? I'm still looking for him. The fish is delicious. Yes. Teresa, go back to the kitchen and make a fresh pot of coffee. Later, when we're smoking, send someone else to bring us the coffee. - Do you understand, Teresa? - Yes, sir. Girl, wait 'til the congressman is done so you can take his cup too. Take the cup, girl. Girl, look what you've done! Now clean that mess and leave. - What's wrong? - I'm not well. I'm going home. - Teresa. - Yes, sir. That girl serving coffee is your daughter, isn't she? Yes. Dinor. You haven't seen her in a long time. She's all grown up, isn't she? Tell her to come here. She went home. On whose orders? Answer me. She was feeling very ill and I allowed her to go. I'm sorry. What's the name of that stocky nigger? - Joilda? - That's it. Tell her to take the congressman a jug of water because he's very thirsty. Unless she's been excused as well. She wasn't, sir. Do you want me to spend the night here today? Getting up early Call upon my friends Getting up early Call upon me and I'll go I will play Besouro Golden belt Besouro Golden belt - Is everything alright here? - Yes, sir. Good morning. This place looks great. - How are you, sir? - Sir. - How Do you do? - Just one spoil and people forget about the whip. Let me know if you need anything. Oxe. Don't you want to work anymore? Look at this, Noca. They don't want to work anymore. - No work. - Go, go. Give me this. You don't understand Besouro. You don't get what he's doing. I doubted him, but it's obvious, folks. It's obvious he's following Master Alpio's work. - Yes, that's right. - Even Chico... He's kicking off the fight that Master Alpio talked about so much. Hurry! Move it, boy! Get out of the way! What is this? Out! Out! What a disaster. What the hell was that? Damn it. Right under our noses. He's in here, he is! I smell nigger's stench! They say this nigger can turn into leaves, plants and stems, so cut off the banana trees! Come on, go for it! Genival, move down along the fence. - Right. - Serafim, take the high path. The rest of you, go through it. We must catch that nigger. Dam it, we must catch that nigger. We must catch that nigger right now! When it's time to eat bananas the monkey lowers his guard. Now, damn it! Cut the banana trees to find out if the nigger bleeds! Come on, damn it. What the hell! Catch that nigger! - Go that way. - Z Moreno, that way. - Look for him. - Come on, man. - Keep your eyes open. - Damn it! Hide yourself! They found the nigger. Z Moreno hit him. Look, the animal is hurt. Over there. Get out of my way. It better be understood the nigger's shielded body was riddled with Noca de Antnia's bullets. - Good God, it's Z Moreno. - Stupid. Moron, look at him! Look at him. Look at that piece of shit. What happened here should teach each of you a lesson. He let a nigger fool him, now he'll eat dirt, damn it. He even allowed to be groomed. Moron! Moron! Do you understand? Now go. Go after the nigger. Go! - Let's go. - Come on. - Let's go. - Move. So not only we didn't solve the problem, but we missed the target. We lost one of our own? You'd better settle this soon, Noca. - It won't be easy, colonel. - Why is that? Because he flies. He what, Noca? Gather around the Capoeira and one day we'll be free Gather around the Capoeira and one day we'll be free Gather around the Capoeira and one day we'll be free - Stop. Hold on, man. - Relax. I'm sorry. - Sorry about what, boy? - We know it's forbidden. I've nothing against your games, just don't overdo it. I don't like disorder and people who harm their own kind. What's your name? Quero-Quero. I want to know who's good in your game. Come on. Go on, play it. Isn't that what you call it? Look at that. That's it, I want to know who's the best. Let's do it. Today was my day, I was inspired. I was well. I was awesome. Dinor. - Dinor? - Yes. Forget it. You've been weird lately. You're in the clouds. But this time Besouro screwed up. I ain't going to defend him. I've always defended him, but this time... I ain't. Do you think what he's done is bad? He is destroying everything we are building. Can't you see? He's destroying everything. I played Capoeira, I said you were in the clouds, the colonel saw and applauded me. Me playing and the colonel applauding. Do you know what that means? He's rebuilding the market and everybody can see it. Only you don't see it. Are you crazy, Quero-Quero? Don't you know the colonel? I'm getting to know the colonel slowly, but Besouro... - I don't know him anymore. - This is not working. For me, it's over, do you understand? Hold on, Dinor. Don't do that to me. It's over. You're too stupid, Quero-Quero. People are saying the nigger's got that... shielded body. Everybody is shielded when the marksmanship is poor. Everything that is closed can be opened, colonel. But it looks like I'm the one who's going to open them. Hi, Dinor. - Why are you dressed like that? - I came to see you. And the colonel summoned me. Do I look good? Came here, Dinor, where are you going? - I'm going to fetch oil. - You are all oiled up. - Let me go! Are you crazy? - I'm crazy for you, Dinor. I said it's over. You look different. You are prettier. I knew you were around. But you must be careful. The colonel is furious and he's looking for you. I'm looking for him too. Quero-Quero has been weird lately. The colonel summoned him to the farm. - What? Quero-Quero? - Yes. I put an end to our relationship. Where are you living? At the old warehouse. When we were kids we made a mess with molasses there. - Remember? - Yes. That place is abandoned, isn't it? Do you want to check it out? - Get up, so you can fall again. - You'll fall too. Our master taught us... how to get up. To elude too. All of this game. I've learned the swing of nature... and I can knock you off. Come. Oxe. Serve me some booze. Are you deaf? Give me another. I'll serve the man with the shielded body. My body ain't shielded. I know who does though. They say nothing hurts people with shielded bodies. Tucum. A knife made of palm trees. Tucum? I see. I know where to find that, Noca. As long as you give the vulture the right meat, it opens the beak. They do say, when niggers don't screw up on the way in, they do it on the way out. Aren't you going to drink? I have to get up early tomorrow. You'd better not drink because liquor and black chicken together make voodoo. My late mother used to say those people jump so much because they have spring knees. I say they do in order to carry loads on their backs their whole lives. I was waiting... to talk to you. I only talk to niggers to order them around. - Wait. - Let go of me, damn it! What's going on, Quero-Quero? Nothing. Are you sure? Yes. Have you seen Dinor lately? Forget about Dinor. She's mine! You know she's mine! - What's going on, brother? - Brother, what brother? Brother. You've always envied me... in everything. You ain't better than anyone around here. You came to hide in the forest with your tail between your legs after what you've done, right? Isn't it? Didn't you come here to hide? Isn't it? You ain't better than anyone around here! You ain't better than anyone in anything! - Anything! - Stop that. - Stop that. - Don't touch me! Have you lost your mind, Quero-Quero? You've always feared me, haven't you? Isn't it so? Fly, Besouro. People say you can fly now. Fly for me to see. Fly here on top of me. You allowed them to get Chico. You allowed them to kill our master! If you can accomplish this blow, Besouro, it can became your imprint. Did you accomplish it, Manoel? I'm going to leave... otherwise I'll regret what I'll do. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name... You may enter. Colonel. That's what I heard. I think it may have been him. - Who? Besouro? - Why not? Besouro has never killed anyone. What's wrong, kid? Besouro? Besouro? What is it? The colonel is coming after you. I know, Dinor. The time has come. Go, Dinor, get out of here. Run! Whenever the sun is on one side, another one will be in the dark. Is that voodoo, nigger? - No, sir. - No? A really good Capoeira fighter walks within the shadows to go unnoticed. Don't look at me that way. Apologize. - Apologize. - Let Go of me. - Hold her down. - Coward! Coward, let Zulmira go. We won't put up with that anymore. Hold him down. Hold him! I'm going to break his knee caps. Hold him down. - Let go of him. - Let's break his knee caps. - You coward! - Hold him. Chico! Chico, my friend! Oh, Chico! Chico, are you alright? Are you alright? - Come. Everything is fine. - Careful with your leg! What are we going to play? "Colonel against Besouro." You are the colonel and I'm Besouro. Then I'm going to kill you. My name is Besouro. Get up to fall down again. I don't want to play anymore. I'll only play if I'm Besouro. - Let's play. - Only if I'm Besouro. - Let's play. - No. The colonel always loses and he is the bad guy. Pedro, Pedro. Pedro! Mom's gone out. Where did she go? I asked where did she go! You'd better get out of here. Don't turn your back on me. Show some respect. Why do I have to respect you? Your mother is the only reason I didn't do anything to you. Let go of me! Right. Submissive like your mother. Where are you, Besouro? Besouro... why did you leave? Besouro? Don't be afraid, Besouro. The seed has been planted. Our people will awake. Now they will. Tucum. A knife made of palm trees. There's no such thing as death, Besouro. Death is to be stepped on by other people. No! No! Don't die, Besouro. A hero is born when the enemy hesitates and makes the worst mistake of all: To think he can put an end to everything. But it's at that time that he makes everything start. Sway, sway, Junior. That's right, sway, boy. Use your magic, use your magic. Now show me the Cartwheel. The Cartwheel. Listen, your mother will be proud of your Capoeira skills, boy. Junior, did you know that every Capoeira fighter can choose his new name? - No, why? - It's a tradition. A Capoeira fighter knocked down 12 men with one swift stroke. One is called Mangrove Crab, another is called Dend. How about you, Junior? Are you going to choose your new name? Do you want to? Now think carefully because that name is for life. And the afterlife too. There's more practice tomorrow. - OK. - Did you choose your name? - Yes. - Already? - What Is it? - Besouro. Just like my father. Because he's black and he flies. Let's go. Your mother is waiting. My Capoeira fighter, let's go to school? Besouro's struggle was fruitful. In 1937, Capoeira started to be tolerated. In 1953, it was fully accepted. In 2008, Capoeira was declared Brazil's Cultural Heritage. Besouro is still chanted in Capoeira Circles all over the world.
