Those two little babies Their names I don't know They strayed away One bright summer's day Those two little babies Got lost on their way Pretty babes in the wood Pretty babes in the wood. Well, that's that then. Let's get a cab. I can't face the walk. Reporter:...situated on the outskirts of the city on the first day of a week long series of special reports from Iraq to mark the fifth anniversary of the Allied invasion. Five years on we've commissioned the most comprehensive survey of the Iraqi people ever undertaken, and it seems like the nation is deeply pessimistic about the future. The people are concerned over the continued rise in violence and about the remaining deep divides in their society. Garvey's here. Hey, big Bill! Can't keep a good man down, can they? - Nice to see you, mate. - Yeah, you too. Karl, make us some tea, will you? I've gotta get out of this monkey suit. Eh, full acquittal though, yeah? - Get in! Come here. - Thanks, man. I knew it was bollocks. They'd never make that stick, would they? It's a fucking waste of the taxpayers' money. Tell you what, it should be legalized anyway, shouldn't it? - Yeah. Anyway, do you want some tea? - Yeah. Maggie, would you make Garvey some tea, please? Oh! ( sighs ) Jesus Christ, it's like a fucking noose! Undo the knot. Come here. - You're just tightening it. - Fucking get it off me, man! Calm down. Just let us have a look. How long has he been here, Maggie? - He's had a sandwich. - The disgusting fat locust. He's not fat. He's got big bones, Bill. Well, he's peasant stock, isn't he? Now, you know, it's all beer and armchairs and TVs, and they're just a load of slobs. It sickens me. His dad was a moron as well. Good to see a friendly face. I thought I'd pop in, make sure you're all right. Tough four months for you boys, I'd imagine. I just thought I'd come and put your mind at rest. Everything's running smoothly. I knew it was all in safe hands. Well, I'll pop to the little boys' room. Hey, you've put on a bit of weight there, Garv. - I don't think so. - I think you're getting a little bit heavier. Yeah, I can see it on the sides-- like handles. Right, thanks. - ( door opens, closes ) - Maggie: Hello, Eric. Thanks. - Boys. - Karl: Eric. They gave you cake for the way out, did they? Karl: Oh, yeah. - Bill: All right, Eric? - Yeah, I'm all right. You? - Yeah, not too bad now. - Looks like a slab of concrete. Bill: Yeah. Ah, it's all right. A little bit stale. Taste's a bit like petrol, but it's okay. Looks like a dog's crapped on it. Look at it. Garvey: I quite liked it. - I thought it was all right. - Oh, it's all right. Karl: If you swill it down with enough tea, it'll be getting there, you know. Eric: Well, don't break your teeth on it. Where'd you get it? I got it from the shop at the end of the road. - Those Pakis are thieves, man. - You shouldn't say that-- Pakis-- anymore, should you? - What's someone from Afghanistan? - Uh, Afghani. - There you go. - Yeah, that's true. - Brain of Britain. - Karl: Yeah. This needs painting over, Maggie. Yeah, everything's a mess here. We can't be too conspicuous. That's the golden rule. I wouldn't want a new house. They've always got problems. You can't trust builders. This situation needs sorting out, tidying up. Yeah. Like someone close in, obviously. Yeah. Well, it's an informant culture, isn't it? - Listen, about that money... - Don't worry about that now. - That's good of you, Garv. - That's all right. - I'll sort it out next week. - No sweat. - I'll bring it round to your house. - Or down the club. - Yeah, okay. Thanks, man. - It's only money, isn't it? - Eric: Any beer about? - Only what you brought, mate. I thought this was meant to be a big party. Well, I'll pop down the offy. Who wants what? Get us some whiskey, some wine and some beer. And some matches or a lighter. - No, a lighter. - All right. - ( Bill sighs ) - Okay. ( phone ringing ) Oh, fuck's sake. Where's Garvey getting the booze from? - Bill: Just the offy over the road. - Valda's coming round. - Bill: Who's coming over? - Valda's coming round. Ah. That's his new bird. Is it? Karl: I've been going out with her for a year. Bill: He's not been going out with her for a year at all. How long have you actually known her? - I haven't seen her in about six months. - He hasn't seen her. - How long did you go out for? - About a year-- 10 months. Eric: I thought I heard she done one. She did, but she just rung up. She's coming round. Eric: Maybe she's pregnant. ( laughs ) Bill: Yeah, that's-- that's extremely unlikely. I fast for January. No to poisons, no to drugs, no food. I only allow myself tea. - Karl: And whiskey. - Fucking hell, Bill. - I feel like a teenage tantric Superman. - Yeah, so do I. Bill: I'm a simple person. I like to reconnect to the essentials. Go on. Come on. Come on, Eric, you're strong, you big-boned bastard. This is like tempered steel. Come on. You do it to me, then I'll do it to you. - Come on! - Eric: Bad-tempered steel. Come on, Eric, I'll let you have a go. - Come on, then. - Let's have it. ( all laughing ) - Looks like a crossover. - Go on, take a dig. - Take a fucking dig, Eric! - Feel that. - It's soft as shite. - Oh, you bastard! I forgot to pick the kids up. - Bill: Oh, a man out of time. - Shit. - Eric: What's happened? - ( phone vibrating ) Oh, that's them outside now. I'd better go. Bill: Who's out there? - Karl: It's his missus. - Bill: Is she coming in? No no no. I'd better go. I gotta feed the kids and that, but-- Is that Helen? I ain't seen her in years. Yeah yeah. We gotta go. Well, uh, nice one. Well done and everything. - Yeah, well done. - Cheers, Garv. Yeah, see you later. See you, Maggie. See you, everyone. Cheers, Garv. Have a good one, mate. She looks absolutely furious. Bill: Give 'em a kiss for me, Garv. Eric: She's fit-- his missus, mate. - Hoo-hoo. - Karl: That's his old missus. His new missus is like a hippo-croco-pig. ( all chuckling ) - Eric: A bit shortsighted. - Looks a bit like him in a lady mirror. Bill: A female version of Garvey. Can you imagine it? Give us one of those beers. Oh, these are from Garvey. - Good old Garvin, eh? - Bill: Yeah, cheers. - What a little superstar. - Eric: He's shaken 'em up, hasn't he? He's totally fucking depth-charged me. Why don't you just pour it over the carpet? - ( urinating ) - Karl. Oi. - Yeah? Hello, mate. - Come here, I've got something to show you. Hold on a second. By the way, when are you coming back to work? Soon. Just got to be a bit careful, that's all. Well, you need to hurry up. I'm running round like a blue-ass fly. This thing don't run itself, you know? - Everything's going all right though, yeah? - Yeah. A bit of trouble in Whitehawk, but otherwise shway shway. - Sweet. - Come on out. I've got something to show you. You are coming back to work, aren't you? - Yeah, I told you. I'm coming in. - ( toilet flushes ) So I don't have to run this whole bloody operation by myself. Get in there. I've got something to show you. - They're not gonna come up, are they? - Doubt it. Oh, fucking hell! It's gone right through the lining on my jacket. - What's that, Eric? - A fucking gun, mate. - Got it off Don the Gun. - Fuck off. That looks totally real, man. ( laughs ) It is fucking totally real. What are you talking about? - You serious? - It's a real gun, yeah. - I just bought it for 200 quid. - ( gun clicking ) Are you serious? This is a real shooter? Yeah, it's a real shooter. I just bought it. I just told you. I need it, don't I? - What, you never seen a fucking gun before? - Eric, Eric, are you out of your fucking mind, mate? What? - Put it away and take it home. - All right, all right. Well, he's not going to see it, is he? I've just got my-- I've just got my prints all over a gun. Oh, for fuck's sake. What are you, paranoid or what? What do you mean? I've just come back from court. - ( sniffing ) - ( laughing ) Oh, for Christ's sake, mate. - What's up with you? - Has this been fired? Don't know. Didn't ask. - Mate... - ( fabric rubbing ) Look, give it to me. I'll do that. - Come on-- - No, I'll do it. Thanks very much, Eric. It don't mean the old Bill are going to come straight round now, are they? Put it away. I don't want to see it again. ( laughing ) Was he always such an unctuous little prick-- fucking Garvey? I'll say he's pretty consistent. Why? I can't believe the old man's left him running that fucking club. He's making a fortune, man. I mean, he's just moved into some flash new drum. Well, that should have me and you on it. What can you say? Bill is Bill. - How's he holding up? - A bit rattled, I'd say. - Minor. - What about you? Fine. I'm just trying not to think about it. You know I'm right behind you, don't you? ( laughs ) What, leading from the rear, yeah? ( laughing ) I've got your back, mate. Where's Garvey? If Benson had testified... ( humming ) It's all right, mate. Calm down. It's all sorted. There you go. Oh, hang on. Here. - All right. Thanks, Karl. - How you holding up? Well, they've shown their hand now, haven't they? Yeah, we're home and dry now though, right? ( sighs ) Are we? I feel like I've been fighting this corner forever, mate. 40 years-- not a bad run. Oh, it was a run, was it? I mean, I was a smoker. I mean, I was a-- I was an artist, a poet. - The head. - I was a head, you know. And I said I would do it. I started doing it and I could have as much gear as I wanted, which was all I was interested in. The funny thing was-- this is what I noticed first of all when I got into it-- was everybody else was into making money, except me. I mean, me and Timothy Leary, you know. I believed that this was a revolution of consciousness and there was gonna be an evolution taking place. And we were gonna find out all these discoveries about the brain and the future and how to be high and stay high and how to be magical, how to live in the world in this sort of new way. But all these other characters basically were into bread. They made money and I ended up just becoming just another criminal like them because of force majeure. Because of Maggie and then you and the rest of it, I had to do something. You know? Studied the "Tibetan Book of the Dead." I learned how to control my consciousness when I got into acid. I knew how to sort of-- I did the full lotus, where you can get into that little pyramid shape. And then it all starts to unfold, you know, and curl up. It goes out the top of your head and there you are, man. And you're like, "Hey, I'm God. I am all men. I can be Everyman. I'm no better, no worse-- certainly no worse than anyone else in the world. I am Man. I am Adam Kadmon." Three things-- that's what I found at the top level. You know what? It's a triangle. It's goodness, truth and beauty. And if things aren't good, they're not true and they're not beautiful. If it's good, it's also true and beautiful. And that was the aim-- to get that little triangle in your forehead so you could see through that lens of goodness, truth and beauty, and see the goodness and see the truth and see the beauty. I've just become some sort of, you know, grim recluse living in my diamond cave. There were good drugs to start with, and then the freak-out of the laws and the paranoia began. And everybody splintered off and went into their rooms and closed their curtains. And the communities were all closed off from one another so nobody knew what anybody else was doing. Everybody else was just paranoid. You're only as good as the people you're with. Yeah, I know. - ( door opens ) - Eric: Okay, lads, double bubbles all round. Yeah. What are we gonna do then, Bill? Well, we're gonna find out who's behind all this. ( blues music playing ) She is the little queen of spades And the men will not let her be Hmm, she's the little queen of spades And the men will not let her be Every time she makes a spread Hoo, fair brown, cold chill just runs all over me. - Oh, all right. How you doing? - All right, Bill? Good result, eh? What's the point of you being on the inside when you don't help us out, Dave? I'm only a counselor, Bill. Look, I done all I could. You've been well lucky this time. Have we? It doesn't feel like we have. So have you any idea where all this has come from? Nobody specific. But it's someone close in. You don't get paid to speculate, David. You get paid for intelligence. The police have got this document. I've told you, it's like a family tree with it all mapped out. And it's well comprehensive, Bill. All kinds of people are on it, mate. It goes right back to your grandfather. It's basically the complete fucking picture. I doubt that. The Barneses, the Cowells, the Pikes-- they're all on it, mate. All their marriages back and forth. Well, that's all public knowledge. So? What can they prove? They don't have to prove anything, do they? Listen to me, Bill. They've just got to look at you and eventually something happens. They know it'll balance out. Well, maybe they need balancing out. In the next life, yeah. ( blues music playing ) - ( music continues ) - Oh, lovely. Fuck! - ( water boiling ) - ( retching ) - Give me a minute, that's all. - Okay. ( sighs ) My God. You've put on a bit of weight, ain't you? For God's sake, Bill, she's-- - You're gonna be a granddad, Bill. - What?! I've heard of sudden death, but sudden birth? Where's all this come from, Karl? Just... When were you gonna tell me? I'm telling you now. My dad's downstairs. My mom is downstairs. He's fucking loving it. I'm never-- I'm never gonna hear the end of this. This is... I don't think your dad is the biggest problem here. Oh, come off it. ( sighs ) Just give me a second. This is quite a number. This... I must be going through a bad phase. Maybe a baby's the thing to pull me out of it. I don't know. Who fucking knows? Or this kid's gonna make it... this kid's gonna make it worse. How does he know this one? I get confused. - They was pen pals last time he was in prison. - ( scoffs ) How do you go to prison for assault when you're the one that's assaulted? Well, you know, it was that unreasonable force thing. That other lad's still not right. - He's not ready. - What's that, Granddad? Granddad to a bastard. - Is there a word for that? - Cunt. Those letters you wrote me in prison were really nice. Good. I've got some... I've got some just here. - You can do a live reading. - ( laughs ) Okay. They were just here. - Doesn't matter. - Fuck. They were just fucking here. - It's okay. It doesn't matter. - It's-- it's not okay. Somebody's moved them. Where the fuck are they? They were just fucking here. Oh, for fuck's sake! - Fuck! - There's some letters down here. They might be down here. They're not down-- they were fucking here, man! - It's okay. - It's not okay, it's fucked! It's fucking typical. It's fucking fucked right up. Mom! Mom-- Mom! Mom! Mom, have you seen those letters? - Calm down. It's okay. - It's not okay! Oh, there they are. I never knew you liked reading so much. This is all just shit we sell on eBay. Oh, I see. Do you like Hitler? A rare book about him here. That's Hitler's dog, Blondie, the Alsatian. Got poisoned. Not really his fault, but there you go. That's war. - Oh, to you, son. - Cheers, Dad. I was thinking it's gonna be really nice out there when you paint that room. Yeah, it'll be lovely. Come on, baby. And maybe while you're doing it, you could think about doing in here. Yeah, no, absolutely. Yeah, sure. - Would you like a whiskey, Valda? - I'm pregnant. Thanks anyway, Bill. Oh well, I suppose it's about time we did pair off, isn't it? - How old are you now? - 27. - Ah. And how old are you now, Karl? - 34. - Come on. - Anyway, see you later. Yeah. Valda: Bye, sweetie. So-- bye. The trap slams shut. How do you know it's your kid? Fucking hell, Dad. You don't wanna find yourself bringing up some other bloke's bastard. Oh, f... It's so typical. Why do you have to be so fucking negative? - You are my fucking son. - No, fuck you! - You're lazy. You're a fucking bastard. - Fuck you! Bill: You don't know who the fuck she is or where she's come from. I went out with her for a year, Dad! I know who she is. - What else might she be keeping from us? - That's fucking bullshit. This is a critical period at the moment. I won't let you fuck it up with this baby bullshit. What the fuck has it got to do with you anyway? Tell her to get rid of it. - Oh! - Bill, it's too late for that. - You've upset your mother now. - Maggie: Get in here. You poor injured fair one Your pardon I crave How soon must I follow you Down to the grave? There is none but you, fair one To see that sad sight And by her distraction He died the same night. Well, what's your intuition about it? Well, you know, I'm not really involved in that anymore-- sort of thing, Bill. I'm kept pretty busy at the club, you know. I've got kids and that. And to be honest with you, I don't feel as comfortable with it physically as when I was a bit younger. You're getting fat. You don't need to make excuses, mate. - All right, yeah. - You know? You and my dad used to be proper terrors, didn't you, back in the day? Your dad was one of my best mates. In fact, he was my closest friend. Yeah. I mean, your dad was-- I would say your dad was the smartest and the funniest man in town. He was the one to beat. - I miss him quite a lot. - We all miss him. What happened to your old man was-- was terrible. I never got over it really. I'm still sick inside about that. You know I think he was murdered, don't you? - Really? - Yeah. - I thought it was just a fire. - Well, yeah. I sometimes think I should avenge his death. That's what I'm supposed to do as the son. But is that bad that I just don't want to? Well, it's all changed now, isn't it? There are no fathers left, or hardly any fathers. All these fucking slags living off the state like fucking parasites, leaving all the men in fucking rooms. - So where are the fathers to avenge? - Yeah. It's all gone, mate. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean. But still... - No, you're doing all right, you know? - Yeah. I mean, you were lucky because you had a dad that was, you know-- it was okay. I had him for a bit, yeah. I mean, my fucking old man-- he died in his bed and let me find him naked and dead when I was 13. Bloody hell. That's terrible, Bill. I'm still sick inside. Never got over that. - What a bastard. - Yeah. That's what dads do-- they die. - You know? - Yeah. Well, anyway, I'll keep my ear out about what happened. Lots of people come through the club. Someone might say something. Well, if you hear anything, mate, just let Karl know... - Of course, yeah. - ...and I'll hear it. - You're all right, son. You're all right. - Cheers, Bill. - Cheers. - Yeah, no worries. Cheers, Bill. - Cheers, mate. - Thanks a lot. Cheers. Garvey. Garvey? That's left of field. I don't like him-- never did. He's too nice. It's a weakness. Being nice is a weakness? Don't be sentimental. Who has the most to gain by you going to prison? There's a lot of people who would gain. I don't trust him. Didn't trust his father either, and we know how that turned out. Yeah, point taken. It's him and his wife and his kids. The police love to get their claws into idiots like that. Oh, Garvey's all right. Based on what? Well, you know, my instincts. Yeah well, that's bullshit. Karl: We quite like the name Enoch or Norbert. Norbert? - It's all right. - Look-- Unusual-- it's an unusual name. It's medieval apparently. - Bill is a good strong name. - Bill? Oh yeah, like, no prejudice. Sure. I don't know how Valda would feel about that, but I'm having a feeling though that she probably wouldn't like the idea very much at all. - Or Billina for a girl. - Billina's not even a name. Check the book. It's not in there. I guarantee it. I think you'll find the feminine version of William is... - It's Wilhelmina. - Wilhelmina. So it could be Billelmina, or short-- Billina. How come there's no pictures of me in this album? This is 1979. I should be all over this album. I've told you a million times-- photos were expensive in those days. Now hang on a second. There's loads of pictures. There's loads of pictures of you two, of this dog that I don't remember. And then... I think that's my foot. I never took any photos. Well, somebody took a lot of pictures. It wasn't me. ( vocalizing ) - Are you going to... - Is that my Gibson? Are you going To Scarborough Fair? That guitar's worth more than you are. It's not a fucking Gibson! Jesus, I gotta fucking listen to you play, like, night and fucking day the whole time with your pals and whatnot. - Why don't you learn some chords? - ( stuttering ) ( playing chords ) I mean somewhere else. - Hey, Karl. - Hi, Chris. - You all right? - How's tricks? - Come in. - Not too bad, mate. Not too bad. - Good to see you two out and about, anyway. - Can you close the door? Hello. Hello. How are you? - Oop! - Where are we? In here? - Out the back. - All right. I'll leave this pram here in the hall. Is that all right? Karl: It's Chris Pringle. Yeah, that's fine, mate. It'll be safe enough, won't it? - Karl: There you go. - Bill: Hello, Mr. Pringle. - How you doing? You all right? - Bill: Yeah yeah. Good to see you two out and about. - I want Grandpappy. - All right, sweetheart. Grandpa. ( babbling ) - Lovely, isn't he? - Karl: Good boy. - Grandpa, Grandpa. - Bill: How old's your boy now? Um... three. Ah, that's a nice age. - Had his first fight the other day. - Bill: Yeah? - He's an indi-- - A little snapper. He's an individual, is he? Like his dad? Yeah, twatted this kid with a xylophone. - It was brilliant. - Really? Yeah yeah yeah. So I'll show you that. He twats him with a xylophone and I'd taught him the two fingers into the throat routine, right? So I'd seen his eyes go-- 'cause he's got his dad's eyes. The next minute, he's across the table with a finger in-- "No!" Pulls him back. He's at him like he's a fucking junior ninja. So they pulled him back. I sees the look in the teacher's eyes, man. He shat himself. - A brick in his underpants. - Karl: Oi, Chris... Chris, he looks just like you. Of course he fucking does. Karl: Yeah, come on then, Kurt. Do you want to help me make the tea? When I was out in Bosnia, you know-- well, actually I went down to have a holiday and ended up just having a go in the war. - Cheap beer. - Karl: Were you in the army, Chris? Which one? Floated about. Don't fight for no king, no country-- no queen, no country. I'm my own principality. Know what I'm saying? Bill: Amen. Yeah. Amen. Testify, brother. - You know the truth. - Passport to Pringle. - Huh? - Passport to Pringle. - ( laughing ) What does that mean? - Oh. - Bill: So I'm standing there in the court... - ( blowing raspberries ) - ( Kurt giggling ) - ...and all of a sudden-- Less of that bit, will you? - Sorry? - Less of that. I don't mind the cuddling, but none of the kissing and farting noises, all right? Just stay where I can see you. Play up and down the hall if you want. That's fine. But don't be taking him into your other room or anything. - ( cooing ) - ( laughing ) Listen, if youse boys need anything done, just give me a shout, won't you? - So... - Hmm? - ( whacking ) - Oh, of course. Don't worry. Got the car out the back-- hatchback. A roll of carpet, gaffer tape, lump hammer-- it's all there. Good to go. Shovel, small handle. Give me 15 minutes-- boom, South Downs. - Good boy. - All right? Modern life these days, you see? - You gotta market. - Bill: You got a point there, Chris. - Have you got a web presence? - Not yet. Listen, catch youse later, all right? Nice to see you. Keep it-- - keep it tight. - Have a good one. - Nice to see your kid as well, man. - He's lovely, isn't he? He took to you, didn't he? Come on. Come on, sweetheart. - You gonna go with your dad? - Is he up the stairs? I was thinking about having Valda round, having a bit of dinner. I suppose. Maggie? I haven't got much in. I'll cook it. Yeah, fine. - Bill: Karl. - Yeah? Look at this glass you've just given me. Karl: Say again? Well, I'm not going to say anything. Would you mind having a look at that? It's fine. You know, this is the first time I've come over for dinner. Really? Hmm. That was rude of us. Bill: How long did you go out together? About three weeks? - A year. - A year? Is that right, Maggie? - Was it that long? - A year. Oh, yeah. Well, what do you see in him then? What do you mean? There's lots to see in him. Dad, just-- Please, Dad, just... It's not an interrogation, yeah? It's just... ( Valda clears throat ) To happy families, all right? Tonight at least. Happy families. - Happy families. - Bill: All right, okay. - All: Happy families. - Cheers, everyone. Cheers, Mom. Valda: Do you need a hand? Oh, fuck. Shit, fuck. Valda: I don't really see my parents much anymore. - Bill: Oh, why's that? - Personal reasons. Ma, have we got a-- a thing for the pasta? Oh, it's all right. I found it. Valda: So he does a lot of cooking around here then, Bill? - No. He hardly ever cooks. - Shit. He's only cooking because you're here. Valda: It's very nice of him to make the effort, isn't it? Well, he can be a good lad, yeah. He's all right really. Maggie: Only the best tonight. Do you know what this is called, this pattern? - Is it the willow? - Yeah, it's the willow pattern. It's a story about runaway lovers, isn't it? Going over the bridge, I think. Is that right? - Did they have a happy ending? - I don't think so. Oh, I think that's what the birds are. I think maybe that's the souls of the lovers after they've been murdered. Karl: What it is, I can tell you, is the lovers... got chased over the bridge by her dad, who's the fisherman, and he trapped them on the island and broke down the bridge. They were trapped forever, but then they turned into birds and they were free. - He's a fountain of knowledge, isn't he? - I never knew that. - Had those since our wedding-- never knew. - Bill: Ah. - Maggie: Lovely. - Valda: Mm, you win 20p. Karl: A bit of salad there, Mom? Bill: Well, I can't say that you're not pretty. - There he goes, the charmer. - Valda: Thanks. - ( laughs ) Yeah. - Maggie: Aren't you? Well, you know, if I was 20 years younger... - Maggie: He was a devil. - Karl: It's more like 35 years younger, Dad. Oh, all right, 35 years. ( laughter ) When he had hair. Karl, could you get me some water, please? Thank you. I think your problem is you don't give Karl enough credit. That's not true. Well, if I'm honest, I think you bully him. You just pick at him all the time. Pick pick pick. You just get at him all the time. Look, it's banter. You don't understand how this house works. I think I do. - Is she always this mouthy? - Karl: What? Maggie: We can't all be Father Christmas, can we? - I'm just being myself, Karl, don't worry. - Girls like you-- - pregnant... - Dad. I bet you don't even know who by. Karl, are you going to say anything? - Karl: Dad-- - Bill: Look-- Dad, Dad! Look, if she says it's mine, it's mine, all right? Mom... You should have known, Karl. You should have known that this was not a good idea. I know, but she's got-- she's got my baby. I've got a fucking headache now. Mom, listen, just-- please, can you just stop him? - I'll be all right. Get back in there. - Just help me. I'll be all right when I've had a drink. ( sighs ) Beam me up. Do you want some help, Karl? Yeah well, there's a bit of pudding. I'll bring it in. I thought there was some vino coming. No, I'll bring it in in a minute, Dad. Let me get the pudding sorted out, get it ready to serve. - Yeah, thanks, Maggie. - I just wanted to have a look at you. Yeah. Why was it you and he split up then? I don't know. It just didn't work out. Quite a lot of temper, fights. But he seems to have, you know, mellowed a bit. Yeah, he's got a temper on him, but we're on top of it now. He got new pills. What do you mean? Well, he has a few mood swings, doesn't he? - But he's a lovely lad. - He's-- he is a lovely lad. - Good night. - ( laughs ) - I'm sorry it was a bit harsh. - Don't worry about it. - It was entertaining. - I'm sorry you didn't like the food. It was fine. It was fine. It was very sweet that you cooked. I thought you were, you know, on good form tonight. I know. Okay, I'm gonna go. - Give me a call. - I will do. - I'll see you out. - Okay. What a fucking little imbecile. Not in front of the boy. She's a sheep. She's a follower. I don't bully him. It's non-aggressive advice. Yeah, she's got her hooks right in. It's absolutely typical of him. - That was good rowdy fun, yeah? - Oh yeah, oh yeah. - It was good to see her again. - Yeah, I'm really glad she's back. Yeah. She should lay off the fatuous advice, though. - You know? - She was just telling it how she saw it. Well, I think she should keep that internal monologue to herself and not share it with the adults. I'm playing at devil's advocate here, Karl, but she's a bit, you know, full of herself. In a nice way, I mean. Conceited. I had a nice time. Garvey'll be around in a bit. Hide the fucking pies, yeah? - Where does your missus think you are? - Late at the club. I don't know why I couldn't tell her what's happening. I told you, it's so she can't be put in a position later on. - And no phones. - Yeah, I left it at home. Don't worry. - So what's going on? - Nothing much. Just tying up a few loose ends. - Was it you? - What? Fucking hell! Are you mental? I've done-- I've done fuck all to deserve this? - Calm down. - What's going on? You lure me out here-- - ( keys jingle ) - What's this? Look, listen, I couldn't get a sitter. Can we sort this out now? - Fuck's sake. - Ears! Shit, that's Chris Pringle! Calm down, lad. It's nothing personal. - What the fuck's he doing here? - An impartial observer. Fuck that! Come here, you fat bastard. - Bill, what's going on? - Everything's okay, Maggie. Don't worry. Yeah, it's just a bit of boisterous fun, Ma. - Put it through, Bill? - No, don't break it down. It's Victorian. So what have-- what have youse got here? Like, you got any tools? Like a knife? A knife would be good. - You didn't bring anything? - This is amateur hour. - No, I was in a rush. - Dude, what the fuck? - I've got a kid, you know. - Are you on a fucking-- you on a meter? Even leaving the fucking house is like a lifestyle choice. You're like my fucking missus. ( yammering ) I've got the fucking kid. I've got to go to work with the kid. Yeah. He's having a kid as well. Oh, are you? You having a kid? That's brilliant. Congratulations, son. Come on, hug it up, bitch. - Cheers, Pringle. - Oh, man. - Dude, what are we gonna do-- - Look, let's finish this amateur hour. - Oh, fuck, yeah. - Keep it down, man. He's in there. Well, he knows we're fucking out here. - Let's flush him out. - I don't want any-- Come out, you little fucker. I'm gonna come in there and get you. I'm gonna fuck you up the ass and set your hair on fire. - Garvey: Fuck off, Pringle. - I'm fucking sick of this shit. A little bit strong. Come on, he's a mate. Look, sorry about that. Sorry, all right? Would little Kurt like some squash, Christopher? - Nothing artificial, Maggie. Thanks, though. - Oh, okay. - Are my vitamin supplements ready, Maggie? - Yeah, come through. - ( knocking ) - Come on, out. - ( cooing ) - Come out, come out, wherever you are. Come out, come out, wherever you are. As I was a-walkin' Down by the Royal Arsenal... Come on, mate. You'll have to come out at some point. No, I won't. You gonna spend the rest of your life in there? Maybe. Come on, mate, don't be a fucking helmet. Come on, this went far enough, don't you think? In white linen And cold as the clay So beat the drum slowly And play your fife for him... - He's right... - I know, he's in there. He's hiding in there. Tell him you can see him. Say, "I can see you." - Kurt: I can see you. - ( Chris chuckles ) Oh, fuck's sake. Oh, whose life was squandered And another young soldier Cut down in his prime. What's taking him so fucking long? Shall we go and see Mommy? - Shall we go and see Mommy? - Yeah. - Yeah, come on. I've had enough. - Mommy. - Where's my mommy? - Good luck to you. I'm sorry. I can't do it. This is an absolutely disgraceful cock-up. Listen, I'm not used to having him under my feet all frickin' day when I'm doing a job. You oughta toughen up, mate. You've left me right in the shit. Karl: Is he still up there? Oh, fucking hell. Nice one, Pringle, you spastic. Fucking forget about it. I'm outta here. Come on, love. - Yeah, cheers. - That's lame. Are you gonna wait this out? My eyes are shutting. Maggie: I'm taking my sleepers, okay? - I don't want any noise. - Yeah, night, Mom. ( knocking ) - Garv, are you coming out? - No. Fuck off. Mate, it's just getting silly now. Garv, I don't know what you think we're doing, mate, but you've got it all wrong. This has just-- this has just been a test. I've been nothing but nice to you lot. Yeah, Garv, but it's, like, been a test of character and you've passed it, mate-- flying colors. - It's all sweet now. - Really? Yeah, come down and smoke the peace pipe. We'll forget all about this. Garv, I swear on my unborn kid we're not going to do anything. - Is that fucking animal Pringle out there? - Pringle's gone, mate. I don't even know what he was doing here. All right, I'm coming out. Come on, you great lump. We never suspected you for a minute, mate. You're getting paranoid in your old age. Yeah, you are, Garv. It's not him, is it? I don't know. I'm tired. He reacted all wrong. I'm good at reading people. He made a run for it. Not an unnatural response in the circumstances. No, I'm talking about your general aura. You know, he's a clown. He's a fool. He's innocent. All right. Garv. - So you having a baby, eh? - Yep. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. I was trying for months with Helen, but she had a problem with her uterus. - Well, I did not know that, Garv. - I'll tell you what. I want to ask you something. On the night the twins were conceived I made this, like, roaring noise. I'd never done that before. - Did you make a noise? - Fuck knows. I don't know, but... So what's the name of the lucky mom-to-be? - Valda. - Valda. Valda Newland? - Why? Do you know her? - Yeah yeah. She went out with my brother a few months ago. - Really? - Yeah yeah yeah. They were pen pals together. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. She's had loads of pen pals from prison. She's a-- she's a lovely girl. She's got a big heart. Well done. I'm painting tomorrow. - What, in here? - Yeah, all around. - What color? - Just white. Oh yeah, nice. Fresh start. - Can you do me a favor for a second, Garv? - Yeah, of course. - Can you just hold this up? - Right. - Just there. - Yeah. Actually, I'm pretty knackered. You couldn't do us a tea, could you, Karl? - Yeah, sure. - What time is it? I've got the kids tomorrow. Ah! Fuck your kids. ( phone ringing ) Eric, it's Karl. Yeah. Any chance you could possibly pop over? Yeah, I'm gonna need your help with something. Come the back way, yeah? Wicked. See you then. 'Twas on one summer's evening All in the month of May Down by a flowery garden Where Betsy did lay... Fat sack of shit, he's done my back in. - ( coughing ) - Oh, fucking hell. Bill will have a full-blown fit if he finds out about this. - I just don't want to hear his voice. - Don't worry about it. Tell you what, this is a blessing in disguise. For us anyway. Jesus Christ, there's probably snakes in here. Yeah, we're gonna put another snake in there in a minute. Mate, the ground is well too hard. ( groans ) We are never gonna do this. It's gonna take all day. Stop your fucking whingeing and get on with it. I-- what exactly are you here to do? I'm here to help, all right? - But you've only brought one shovel. - Take a fucking turn! It's not a fucking two-man shovel, is it? You take your turn, then I'll take over. This is bollocks. We'll never get him into this ground, mate. - We're just gonna have to leave him. - We can't fucking leave him. We'll just have to fucking think of something else. You have a fucking go. Get in there and dig up-- For fuck's sake. You're fucking useless, you are. Here's a bit of fucking soft ground here. There's no fucking soft ground in there. Yes, there is. It's fine. Eric: Fucking coming out here to commune with fucking nature. - Fucking hell. - I don't know how you do this as a job. You're fucking useless at it. Christ on a bike. Look at you. Jesus, mate, hold the fucking gate. I ought to fucking knock you off, you ponce. ( muttering ) Are you leaving for the country? You say the city brings you down Leave the iron clown behind And feel the circus moving on Are you leaving for the country? I know a little country town Where dogs are sleeping in the cold And the flagpole's falling down... I wonder if it's gonna be a girl or a boy. - What, your forthcoming progeny? - Yeah. Science suggests it'll be a girl. Why would it suggest that? Because the man determines the sex of the child. So what diff-- what does that mean? - Well, you're that type. - What type? Well, the type that science talks about. What, the type of person that only has girls? What, you think I've only got girl sperm? Listen, man, you can't argue with science. Who'd call their kid Misery? ( knocking ) Dad, that's the door. Pa, that's the door. - ( knocking ) - ( sighs ) Oh, fucking hell. Don't get up. - All right, Karl. - All right, Dave. - I hear you're getting married. - That's right. ( laughs ) Ducked 10 years and ended up getting life, eh? - All right, Bill. - Hello, Dave. Garvey never went home last night. Bill: Oh, yeah? Is that official? Yeah. I've had his missus on the phone to mine. After one night? He's on a short leash. He never goes away, does he? So, uh, was he here? - No. - Karl: Not seen him. Well, who was here last night? Just-- just Pringle. Fucking hell. Pringle. That's non-helpful. Right well, look, if you see Garvey, you get him to give me a bell, yeah? - Sure. - Karl: Sure, will do. - Yeah, well, I-- - We'll see you later, man. I just don't want his missus... - Bill: Take it easy, Dave. - ...scaring up a big search party. I'll see you later. - Well, where do you think Garvey is? - I don't know. He's... I don't like this. Do you think Eric's into much with Garvey? Eric owes Garvey money. Quite a bit, knowing Eric. Why? What's wrong? What's Eric got to do with it? Garvey's missing, that's all. Nothing to worry about. I think someone must have picked him up between here and his drum. - I can't go to prison, man. - I know. I'll never come out. It's a confessional culture, man. People just can't shut up. Pringle will go then, yeah? - But who has he told? - He lives with his mom. The kid's with his ex-missus. It's unlikely he's gonna say anything germane to her. Yeah, let's hope not, eh? What do you think, Bill? ( sighs ) I don't know. Mags? Pringle tells his war stories to whoever'll listen. The mom's a notorious chatterbox. Just to be safe then, yeah? Okay. This is on me then, yeah? I'll deal with Pringle and his people. This is turning into a right fucking massacre. - Yay. - What about the kid? He's got a kid. Yeah, the kid's about two. He can't even talk, can he? I mean, what's going to happen to the kid? He'll probably end up getting sent to a decent school. Would you want Pringle as your old man? Can't believe they've brought this on themselves. They're so selfish. Disappearances and accidents, Eric. No showboating. Bill, come on. Here, Pa. - Cheers. - Eric: To Garvey. All: Garvey. - Bill: And Pringle. - Yeah, and Pringle. All: Pringle. - A shame about his kid. - Yeah. Don't think about it. I'm not. Still... that's the way it goes, isn't it? A lot of children die. What time is it? What, now? It's about 25 past 4:00. - Why, have you got an appointment? - Nah, I was just wondering. ( waves crashing ) - It's just nice to be out of the house. - Mm. Sometimes don't you think you could just walk straight out into the sea and never come back? You're full of cheery little introspective observations today. What did you want to be when you grew up? Nothing. How much do you love me? Rah! Eric: Oi, Pringle. - You all right, mate? - How you doing? - I've got a little job for you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You up for it? - Yeah, nice. Come on, mate. Come on, jump in. It's lovely here, isn't it? - Stinks of shit, mate. - Yeah. But I like those fresh country smells. - You know what I mean? - So what's this all about? Just gotta see a geezer over here. Don't worry about it. - Whereabouts? - Just over here. - By this caravan? - No no, just by the side of the caravan. Nothing to worry about. Don't worry. ( laughs ) Aw, come on, man. What about my son? Oh, don't fucking cry, mate. Oi! Oh, for fuck's sake, where do you think you're going? ( dog barking ) Twat. Ma, I'm gonna move out. I thought Valda was gonna move in here. Val wants our own space. I think she's right. Well, you'll need help with the baby. I mean, she looks frail. I'm having a kid. I can't go to prison. Nobody's going to prison and you're going to do as you're told. I don't want to do any of this anymore. I just want to be a... I just want to be a normal dad. - Mrs. Pringle? - Yeah? I'm a friend of your son's. Eric, yeah? You remember me? - Is he all right? - Yeah, he's fine, yeah. You been shopping? You bought anything nice? Oh, just a few bits for the kids, you know. - Trying to cut back a bit these days. - Yeah, times is tight. - We've all got too much anyway, haven't we? - That is true. I can't believe how much he looks like his old dad. Yeah, poor little thing, eh? ( laughing ) What time is this bus coming then? - ( screams ) - ( tires screeching ) And the fat man? Oh, he's really shit the bed on this one, mate. Looked all over for him-- high and low, here and there. - Yeah? - Pie shop. - He's gone. - Yeah, I thought so. I had a feeling. - Bill: You want a whiskey? - Yeah, lovely. What's going on, you know, with the business and-- and the club? Well, looks like I'm gonna need a new manager, doesn't it? Yeah, I've been having a little think about that. - Cheers. - Yeah? Yeah, just, you know, about who to put in there. - Yeah. - And then I thought, I ran Foxy's, didn't I? - For 10 years down in Eastbourne. - Oh, yeah. We did a great job down there, mate. Great job. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. - That was a long time ago, Eric. - I mean me and Karl-- - it would keep us busy. - Karl's a very busy boy. Yeah. No, he's probably too busy, but I've still got time. I could help out down there. I thought it'd, like, dovetail with the business. Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously I understand where you're coming from, but I'll leave it with you. Have a little think about it, mate. I'll tell you what, I'll think about it. Yeah yeah, nice nice. Okay. So what? I'll call you later maybe, have a chat? I mean, it's a good idea-- a good idea, Bill, because I feel that the club could be-- I've got some ideas for the club, strategic ideas. ( blues music playing ) Running a club. ( scoffs ) - Helen. - Where is he? - Bill? - My husband! How should I know? I'm cooking. - I just want his body! - Shh, keep it down. - Whatever's left! - Keep it down, keep it down. I don't want him lying out there in a ditch! - Keep it-- keep it-- - I won't keep it down! Getting eaten up by-- by things and foxes, you fuck. Look, you're under a lot of stress, Helen. I understand it, but it's totally out of order. You cold bitch. You're just like your father. - Get out of here. - You'll end up just like him. ( shouting, banging ) Unacceptable, Bill. I told you when we started this-- no drama. She's a prime candidate for shock treatment. - Nobody is gonna listen to her ravings. - Not listen? I am surprised they didn't hear that in fucking Kent. Why'd she start talking about my dad? Why'd she have to say that? Karl: Oh, Jonny. How you doing, buddy? ( chattering ) - Jonny. - Good journey, yeah? Not really, no. Well, what brings you all the way down from London, Jon? I told Jacob I didn't want to come down, Bill. Well, why didn't he come down himself? Jacob's a little, uh, disappointed in you, Bill. A general vibe of confusion and carnage coming from your end. There's been a few ructions, but it's evening out. Is it? Because it doesn't feel that way. It feels like it's spiraling into chaos, Bill. You and your idiot son in and out of court, police sniffing around everything, known associates doing moonlight flits. It's the last thing we fucking need, Bill. - Well, agree with me at least! - All right, I agree. I don't think you even know what problems you have, Bill. - Will you tell me then? - I'm not here to explain things, Bill. I'm here symbolically, yeah? As a reminder that we're all in this together, yeah? - Yeah. - Some straight thinking is called for, Bill. - You've let things slip away. - But I mean, look, give this to Jacob and tell him we're not falling behind. This, Bill-- this is money, yeah? You know there's more to this than money. - Sorted, Jonny? - Sorted, Maggie. Make sure he doesn't get too excited, eh? Yeah, I'm watching him, Jonny. I know you can see the bigger picture, yeah? Yeah. This house, eh-- - a lot of nice memories. - Oh, yeah. I don't want anything to mess with that. Well, it's only work, eh? Nobody's gonna mess it up, Jonny. You poor injured fair one, your pardon I crave How soon must I follow you down to the grave? There's none but you, fair one To see that sad sight And by her distraction he died the same night. Maggie... I'm not right. I'm... I'm having a stroke, Mags. Call an ambulance. - ( coughing ) - I've poisoned you, Eric. What? What with? What have you done? You informed on my husband and my kid and then you killed Garvey. It's causing all kinds of complications. ( coughing ) It's not true. Maggie, it's not. I swear. You always was a wriggler, even when you were a kid. ( gagging ) It's not true. It wasn't me. If you weren't family, I wouldn't have anything to do with you. I mean, look at this bloody mess. All I ever do is clear up after bloody men. Are you listening, Eric? Christ. Oh, well. Bill: I mean, he could be all right, your brother. - We had some great laughs. - Maggie: Did we? Yeah. It's a rotten thing to have happened, but tough decisions have to be made. It's not the decisions that are tough, Bill. It's the actions. Well, a general can't regret decisions made in the heat of battle. When all is said and done, we will believe we were right. It's important to have the right intentions, no matter the outcome. - Do you want to make some tea? - Yeah. I'm the man that rolls When icicles is hangin' on the tree I'm the man that rolls When icicles is hangin' on the tree. For fuck's sake, stop doing that! Where's Eric? I haven't seen him in a few days. Eric's in Spain. What? Now? - Yeah, he's got troubles of his own. - Oh, great. All hands to the pump and I'm the only one left to do the donkey work. Yeah, well, people are unreliable. - What? - He's gone down there I think to-- to buy a bar. I think he's gonna start a club - called Los Foxos. - No! ( both laughing ) El Foxo! - That's nice. - Yeah. - Bingo. - A bit of bingo. I can see Eric leading the conga, up at the front. Yeah. I think he must have caught a whiff of a seorita. You know what I mean? Got straight to the airport and disappeared. Sounds like a retard's dream. Well, that's about the size of it. Fucking hell, he's not-- - El Foxo's-- that's brilliant. - Yeah. ( folk music playing ) We'll rant and we'll roar Like true British sailors Range and roam All on the salt sea Until we strike soundings In the channel of old England From Ushant to Scilly Is 35 leagues We sailed past Beachy Past Fairlight and Dover And then we bore up For the South Foreland light... All together now, boys. We'll rant and we'll roar Like true British sailors Range and roam All on the salt sea Until we strike soundings In the channel of old England From Ushant to Scilly Is 35 leagues. Bill: Oh, come on, Maggie. Sweetheart, come back to the party. Come on. Come on. ( sniffles ) I can't, Bill. It's too much, Bill. - Come on. - ( sobbing ) Oh God. ( song ends ) ( coughing ) ( folk music playing ) ( coughing ) Are you leaving for the country? You say the city brings you down Leave the iron clown behind And feel the circus moving on Are you leaving for the country? I know a little country town Where dogs are sleeping in the cold And the flagpole's falling down. ( humming ) I knew I couldn't last. You're as strong as an ox, Dave. No... I'm done. You got any last words? Any thoughts? - I'm tired. - Yeah, you have a sleep, mate. I'm sure you'll pull through. Yeah, maybe. - The doctors said-- - Oh, Dave... don't listen to what the doctors say, mate. What do they know? What is it, mate? Bill's a liability, Karl. Yeah? It's all over for him. It's just a matter of time now. What makes you say that? I hear things. What, on Ceefax? You say goodbye to him for me, will you? Yeah. - I always liked your dad. - ( laughs ) That makes one of us, Dave. Eric's been found. - Where is he? - He's dead, Karl. No. - I'm sorry, mate. - He's in Spain, mate. - He was a police informer, Karl. - Bullshit. That's bullshit. That's-- that's bullshit. Eric, Garvey, your old man-- they all talk to plod. How else do you think your court case got squashed? No. Look at the fucking state of me. Why would I lie? Huh? Why would I lie? You'd better fucking die, Dave. Oh. Berman's dead. To Dave Berman having a drink in heaven. - ( glasses clink ) - Dave. Dave. Had a good run, though, didn't he? He's left us right in it though really, didn't he? I mean, it's a bit selfish. I mean, would a bit of exercise have hurt? His poor wife. ( tsking ) Yeah, the old ones all drop away. It suddenly feels like the end of the world. You're just tired. It's all a bit fucking tiring. You know, I liked it best when it was just you and me. ( both grunting ) - ( thudding ) - ( grunting, groaning ) ( groaning, coughing ) ( wheezing ) ( squishing ) ( labored breathing ) ( breathing stops ) Oh, Christ. You see? And you want to leave this house? It's not safe for you out there on your own. ( heaving ) - Who did this to you? - One of yours, was he? - What you are talking about? - Well, it feels like your style. And you call me sloppy. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Come off it. Own up to it. Own it! Fucking own it! - Look what you fucking did to me. - The situation's-- Look what you fucking did to me. It's got nothing to do with me. It's probably London. That's bullshit and you fucking know it, you fucking liar! It could be a local faction making a move. How the fucking hell do I know? I mean, I don't run this town, man. - It's like juggling oil now. - You said it was all under control. You fucking told me it was all under control. That's an arrogant illusion. It fucking is an arrogant illusion, and you're the fucking arrogant one, you prick. - Look, all-- - Fucking leave me alone, Dad. I'm serious. Get out of my fucking business. I'm fucking serious. I don't wanna hear another fucking word from you. - I'll fucking knock you out. - Yeah? Well, all I know is, all right, one, investigations; two, that fucking woman turns up; three, a trusted associate goes missing... Stand fucking back, man. I'll put these glasses in your fucking face. I'm not kidding. Yeah? And four, a representative of London comes down; and five, you get attacked. I mean, those are the facts, right? Saying them in a row doesn't connect them. It's got nothing to do with me. Where's Eric? - Do you even know if it's your kid? - It is! What the fuck? Where is Eric? Look, I'll be absolutely honest with you, Karl. She has to go. - What are you talking about? - It's her-- Valda. - Before the baby's born. - What? You'll be too attached to her by then. Are you out of your fucking mind, Dad? - We're getting married. - Well, that's off. No, we're getting married, Dad. We're having a kid. We're-- we're getting married and we're having a kid. - Trust me, son, you're too weak. - I'm not weak. - Look-- - I'm not fucking weak. You've grown up privileged and spoiled and soft, and now you're unconcerned about other people's needs. What the fuck are you talking about? I do everything for you, Dad. I do everything for you. I make your fucking tea, your fucking breakfast. I make your fucking dinner half the time. I run your errands all over town. What more do you want from me? Come on, seriously. - She's unbalanced your mind. - Fucking hell. She's driven you crazy and you're not making any sense. One more word from you about her, Dad... Just keep your beak out, all right? You want your mother and I to go to prison? - You want us to be murdered in our beds? - No! Look, listen to me. She's got to go. She's the rogue element. You could have had the breakfast room decorated by now. Who are you siding with? Your blood or some stranger you rocked up? She's not just rocked up. I've been going out with her for a year. She's carrying my child. What fucking qualifications does she need, Dad? Oh, I see. You're thinking, "Wait till the old ones pop their clogs and then get the house." - Is that it? - I don't want your fucking house! I'd rather give it to a cats' home than to you and that fucking slag. I don't want your fucking house. You'd betray your family just to bring up another man's bastard? Don't talk to me about betrayal. I know that Eric is dead. And I know that you, Eric and Garvey - have been talking to the police. - What?! - Where'd all this come from? - Berman told me. - Death-bed confession, was it? - As it turns out. He was addled with morphine. Fucking hell, he was chatting his bollocks to anyone who came into the room. - Was he? - Yes. - Was he? - Yes! Look, you can just tell it to me straight, Dad. Just fucking be honest with me for just-- for just a minute. Just one minute. Just fucking tell me what's going on in there. Oh, you can't fucking do it, can you? You fucking coward! This is disappointing. Take no notice of him. He just says the first thing that comes into his head. How can you stand him? He's a fucking nightmare. - No, he's not a nightmare actually. - He is a fucking nightmare. - Karl, calm down. - Mom, just fucking leave me alone, all right? It's not him, Karl. It's you. I mean, why don't you just get a blood test? And then if the baby's yours, it could come and live here. It'll be-- it'll work out. It'll be fine. What about Valda? Oh, Valda, darling-- she'll be like all the rest. - She'll leave you. - What are you talking about? Oh God. When you was little, right? When you was born, it was very different then, Karl. And they... you know, they couldn't help babies out like they do now. And there was something wrong-- something went wrong. I don't know. The incubator-- oh, God knows what went on really. I'm sure that's why-- all this business about Eric-- ( weeping ) Please stop. No, please stop. All this business about Eric-- and you know your dad-- we had nothing to do with that. You all are fakes. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't wanna tell you. Come here, darling. Come here. Come... I'll tell you what. I'll get you your pills, eh? You need a nice lie-down. Maggie: Tell me why The stars do shine Tell me why The ivy twines Tell me why The ocean's blue And I will tell you Just why I love you Because God made The stars to shine Because God made The ivy twine Because God made The ocean blue... ( crying ) Because God made you That's why I love you. Sorry, Mom. Oh, don't you remember A long time ago? Those two little babies Their names I don't know They strayed away One bright summer's day Those two little babies Got lost on their way Pretty babes in the wood Pretty babes in the wood Oh, don't you remember Those babes in the wood? - You expecting someone? - Yeah. It's Valda, Mom. - I thought we were going into town? - Yeah, I know. I thought maybe you could go with her instead. Why? - Just talk to her a little bit. - What about? Well, she's just freaking out, Mom. What, about the baby? Yeah. Maybe you could just settle her down a bit? - I'm not a counselor, Karl. - Mom, please, Mom. Fine. Maggie: How are you feeling? Valda: Feeling pretty good, actually. Yeah, not for long. ( chuckles ) - Valda: What do you mean? - Oh, getting it out. Boy, the pain. You want someone to shoot you. It's the great conspiracy of women-- no one ever tells you. I didn't speak to my mother for days. Karl weighed 9lbs 10oz. There's the car. Nice bit of fresh air anyway. Can you grab my cardie out of the boot, please, Maggie? Yeah. Oh, what's all this plastic? - Do you know where your mother is? - She's gone out. Yeah? Gone where? She's gone out with Valda. - They're up on the downs. - Oh. I wonder if we're still having sausages tonight then. I don't know. You all right, Karl? Got a bit of a problem, Dad. That sounds ominous. It's like that, is it? It's for the best... for everyone. Look, why don't you just have a cup of tea with me and talk about it, Karl? No, that's all right. You have one. Do you love me? I love you. I can't talk to you anymore. You just confuse me. What's your mother going to say? Karl: She's gone already. - Bill: What's happened? - Dad, just sit down. - Just sit down. - Karl, where's Maggie? - Karl, where is Maggie? - Just sit down, Dad. ( weeping ) ( wailing ) ( door opens, closes ) - Valda: Hello? - We're in the breakfast room. - Well, there he is. - Yeah. How did it go? He was all right with it, actually. He was fucking shattered, wasn't he? He was knackered. ( folk music playing ) Where is now my father's family That was here so long ago? Sitting round the kitchen fireside Brightened by the ruddy glow But we shall all be reunited In that land beyond the skies Where there'll be no separation No more marching, no more sighs Some have gone to lands far distant And with others made their home Some upon the world of waters All their lives have chose to roam We shall all be reunited In that land beyond the skies...
