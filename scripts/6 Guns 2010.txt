What's your name? When someone sticks out their hand, it's polite to oblige and shake their hand. My name is Lee Horn! What is YOURS?! Selina! Nice to meet ya, Selina. I'm sure you already met my good friends. This is one of the famous Bell brothers, Chris... that's his big brother, Joe. Russian Pete... and Tommy Clyburn, the El Paso Kid.

And I've got a couple horses, and I've got some guns that are still workin'. You're placing the value of human life on guns, horses, and 30 mangy dollars? You have nothing to offer, Will. If I want something, I'll just take it. Keep my wife out of it! Shut up! Keep your mouth shut. What are you doing with a broken down, cowardly old law man like this one, anyway? MY PA AIN'T NO COWARD! Indeed he is, my boy. Get...! Shooting a helpless man in the back, killing him in cold blood. My father said you were tough, tougher than nails.

How fast you were... you never missed... always got your man. I been waitin' a long time for this. And it's turned out way better than I expected. Let's have some fun, darlin'! Get on!

Now, you just about the sweetest thing I ever seen! YOU GONNA LIKE THIS! You finish her up. You boys meet us back in town. LET'S GO! What the hell you doin'? Give me your pistol. What in the hell you doin'? I said, gimme your pistol! What is going on? GO! Get away! Get away from me! Aw, what's the matter, you drunkard? You drop your hooch? Aw, all that stink. You ever hear of soap, you son of a bitch? Come on... can't you get up, you drunk? Hey. UGH! Easy, Mister! She's just the town drunk! Help her up. Pick up them groceries. Now apologize. Sorry, ma'am. Sorry. Get. Howdy do, Frank. I haven't seen you in a coon's age. Been out on the trail, have you? Runnin' down those, uh, cattle rustlers and murderers? I guess you'll be gettin' a room over at the Billards? Uh, we had some trouble yonder, a few months back. Huh. Bad bunch of boys come through here and raped a woman, killed her whole family. Husband and kids, Frank. It was an awful mess. I, I wish you woulda been here. So, how long you planning on staying this time? How much? Let's see... that'd be, uh, 26. Always feel safer when you're in town, Frank. Well, I'll be. If it ain't Frank Allison. How are you, Frank? Suppose you'll be needing a room? Same as usual? Corner room upstairs, around the back? Yeah. Your money's always good here, Frank. You stay as long as you like! Town always feels safer when you're here, Frank. Good talkin' to ya, Frank! I can't help you none, Frank. I haven't seen half of these men before. Haven't even heard of 'em. You'd think they'd know better than to come lookin' to trouble this town, though, huh? Whoa... hold on a second. I know this son of a bitch. That's Lee Horn. He come through here a couple months ago with his gang. Killed a whole family on the outside of town. Raped the wife, left her for dead. She's still alive? Yeah. She's in a real bad way now, though. Got drunk all the time. Understandably so. What she look like? She looks like a drunk, I reckon. She still lives on the outskirts of town. She comes into town maybe twice a week, Pick up her hooch, mind her own business. She don't bother nobody. I was to help her husband that day on the house. And, uh... my wife was sick, on account of being pregnant and all. So I didn't go. When I went the next day... I found her. Lord, what a mess. She said Lee Horn come and murdered her whole family. Frank! You're welcome to stay as long as you like. Always feel safer when you're here. What is it? Saw a movement in these rocks. I don't see nothin'. What you all lookin' at? Lee saw movement, over near the rocks. Hold it right there, Lee. You and your boys are under arrest. Let's take this nice and easy. What seems to be the problem, Deputy? Plenty. Your latest transgressions were robbing those banks down in Benson and Douglas. But worst of all was the murder of Will Stevens and his boys. "Most recent transgressions". Those are big words, boys. Means this man's educated. Makes him even more dangerous. Let's not have no shootin' there, Lee. Enough people been killed. Indeed, why would there be more shooting? We don't want any trouble, sir. No! You want us to grab their ammo? Interesting what he said. What? He mentioned Will Stevens and the boys. Didn't say anything about the wife. You did do what I told you to? I told him to, Lee! He wouldn't do it. Hell, he didn't even have his time with her, like the rest of us. Is that so? Wasn't no need to kill her. We were there for the Sheriff. You never said nothing about him having no wife and kids! And what difference does that make? THEY WERE CHILDREN, LEE. Well now, come on now, boss. It don't matter none if we, if we didn't kill her. Right? Yeah, it does, you idiot. She's a witness! How the hell do you think that deputy knew about it in the first place? We go to Mexico. What difference does it make? Yeah, we best get going, boss. Do anything like that again, and I'll kill you. Boss, that's not the way to Mexico. We're not going to Mexico. We're going back to Bisbee. Shit! Who's that? That there is Frank Allison. Best bounty hunter in the West. Hey. Can I get you anything, Frank? Samuel got any of that stew? Sure does. I'll tell him to get you a bowl. Anything else you want? Excuse me, ma'am. I didn't see you there. Howdy, Selina. Suppose you'll be wanting your usual? Her "usual" being the whiskey? Frank, she's hurtin'. Well, keeping her liquored up all the time isn't gonna help her. It's what she wants, Frank! Bring her some soup. Sit. You should get yourself cleaned up. You're the lady whose family was murdered. I may be looking for these men. That's what I was gonna talk to you about. But here you are talkin' to me. I have some pictures. You can look at 'em if you want. Tell me if it's the same men. Can you tell me how many there were? Five. There was five of them. Everything okay here? There's your soup, Selina. Gonna get cold. You're not a lawman. You're a bounty hunter. I want you to teach me how to shoot. Pardon? Teach me how to shoot. No. Why? Why not? You wanna protect yourself, wear one of them garters on your leg under your skirt. Keep a small blade in it. For me and the lady. Wait! Why won't you teach me to shoot?! Wait! Selina, don't bother the man. Why won't you teach me to shoot? You leave him be! Go back and sit. Get something to eat besides whiskey. Like Mr. Allison said. How many you want? I'll take two, Sheriff. I'll take two, also. And weep. Henry, how many you want? I'll take two. Frank? Oh yeah. Guess what, Frank. I don't want any either. Here. Check. Check. Uh... how's that look? Looks good to me, 40. Frank's probably gonna bump it up. Just callin', huh? Alright, I'll call. I got nothin'. He's got nothin'. Henry? Three jacks. Well, I got you beat. I gotta straight. What do you got, Frank? Flush. Again? Come on. Jeez! That Frank is a poker ace, that is for sure. Hey... you, ah, you hungry, Selina? No. That's it for me, fellas. I'm out. Take care. Good playin' with you. Alright. Not much fun, just the four of us. I can play. You know how? Well enough. You got money? Looks good to me. Frank, you alright with the lady playin'? Queens. Well, I got you beat, Frank, 'cause I got three jacks. Two tens for me. Got you all beat with a straight. That's it for me, fellas. The lady has broken me. It's gettin' late. Better be headin' home. Alright. Back to work for me. Fellas... ma'am. See ya later, Frank. So long, Selina. I cleaned up. What'd you say? I cleaned up. Good. You gonna teach me to shoot? I can pay you. Give you back all this money you lost today. I don't need your money. Besides, what do you wanna learn how to shoot for? Please... Frank, please teach me how to shoot. Well, I'm supposed to ride out in the morning, but... Suppose I could stop by for a bit. Sheriff says you live on the outskirts of town? Yes. About a mile west. Stevens place. You can't miss it. Thank you, Frank. You came. Said I would. I did what you told me. That's good. Am I gonna teach you or not? Come in. Please. Haven't kept the place as clean as I should've past few months. That's your husband? Yes. Will Stevens, right? You knew him? Knew of him. Lawman out of Texas. Would you like a cup of coffee? That'd be nice. Thank you. Thank you. All those years married to a lawman, he never taught you how to shoot? Wasn't no need to. But now there is? Why's that? I ain't got no one protectin' me anymore. Fair enough. First things first. Your grip. Gotta be tight. Can't have a lose hand. You got a lose hand, you ain't gonna hit anything. I said tight. Alright? And hold it out there. Don't lock your elbow, But don't bend it too much, either. It'll kick right back and hit you in the face. Knew a feller broke his nose like that once in a gunfight. Made a mess. Look right down your arm. Down the sight there. Down it. Pull the trigger? No. Not yet. Let's start over. Why? Pullin' the trigger's the easy part. Learnin' how to draw and aim, that's the rough part. So we're gonna do it over, and... I don't need to learn that. I need to learn how to shoot, Frank. Won't make any difference. You don't learn how to draw properly you'll be dead already. I don't need to learn how to draw. I need to learn how to kill a man! Alright then. If you can draw quicker, shoot before me, then you're ready to practice shooting. What're you waitin' for? Holster that weapon! When you're ready, draw. If you beat me, shoot me dead. I'm not gonna tell you again. Look. I've never shot a woman before. I'm not plannin' on doin' it now. But if you're gonna be stubborn, you best beat me to the draw If you want me to keep practicing with you. Where are you going? We're done. What do you mean "we're done?" Just that. Wait! Wait, where do you think you're going? Wait! Wait, Mr. Allison, will you just wait for one moment? Where are you going? Mr. Allison, where are...? I said I was sorry! I'm sorry, okay? I will listen to you! Just wait! MR. ALLISON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME! Frank, you in there?! Frank?! Frank. They're comin' back. They killed Deputy Thompson. They killed him and his whole posse on the Old Spanish Trail. They're killin' everybody, Frank. Everybody in their path. Who's that, Sheriff? Lee Horn! What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do, Frank? How many men can you round up? Oh, I don't know. Folks are scared to death After what Lee Horn's gang done to Selina and her family. How many? I think none, Frank. Reckon it'll just have to be you and me, then. Ah, now, hold on now. Why don't I get on the wire to Tucson? See if I can get us some help. Get on the wire, then. But if Horn gets here before help arrives, We better be ready for 'em. Gonna go wire. It's a good way to get yourself killed. Thought you were leaving. What are you doin' here? I want you to finish teachin' me how to shoot. Well? I'll be back by tomorrow. Now, this holster, you're gonna have to pull straight up and out. Or else it's gonna hang up every time. Try it. Alright, well, let's try shooting, alright? Remember, arm out in front, both eyes open. Don't cross in front of your body, or you won't shoot straight. Now, we're gonna squeeze the trigger. Don't yank it. But make it one fluid motion. Don't pull it halfway. Commit to it. You yanked. No, I didn't. I squeezed! You yanked! Okay. Okay. Can I try again? Give you somethin' to shoot at. Maybe that'll help. Try and remember everything I told you. You expected to hit it? Yes. Take you a hundred tries. And that's if you're lucky. What are you waitin' for? You got three more shots in that gun. Shoot. Alright. You're reloaded. You know, you're holdin' your breath. No. I told you it would take a while. Yeah. You said that already. How many men have you killed? Twelve. I've killed twelve men. Is it hard? To shoot someone? Shootin' them is not hard. Killing 'em is something else entirely. But you only kill a man when he tries to kill you. Or if maybe he deserves to die? Wouldn't be my right to judge that. But what if they'd done something... so horrible that... Like what Lee Horn did to you? Yes. Be my duty to turn 'em over to the law. But what if it was YOUR family, YOUR life? You'd kill 'em, Mr. Allison. You know you would. Yeah. Yeah, I'd kill 'em. Damn it! See you tomorrow morning? I ain't learned to shoot yet. All day, and I didn't hit a damn bottle. Said you'd teach me to shoot. Tomorrow, then. Whoa. Nice shooting. Frank! Selina, how are you? Frank, can I, can I talk to you for a minute? Why don't you reload and keep practicin'? Tucson dispatched a couple of U.S. Marshalls And a couple of deputies to come out here, after they got my wire. Well, got word that they found Lee Horn. So they set up a whole ambush in this place called "Dog Creek" On the Gila Trail, about two days ago. Yeah. I know the place. Well... a mail messenger found 'em, dead. Who? The two U.S. Marshalls and the deputies! The Gila Trail, that hits the main road into town? Yeah, well, any idea how soon they'd be here if they was to come from Dog Creek? About two days, I reckon. What about Tucson? They sending anyone? Oh, nah. They got... they got half a regiment Chasing some Apaches up the side of a mountain. They said they can't spare anyone for week. Anyone else you can call on? Well, that would be Deputy Thompson, but Lee killed him. They're all dead, Frank. There ain't nobody left! Lee Horn done killed 'em all! So what're we gonna do? Why don't you stay here tonight? Pardon? You're just gonna be back here in the morning. Put down your things. I'll make us some supper. Don't reckon I've ever had a roast this good before. Pot roast was Will's favorite. He'd eat it every day. Breakfast, lunch and supper. Stick his nose in the kitchen, say, "Cookin' a roast?" Yeah, well... vegetables, chicken, bread. He always thought he smelled a pot roast. You have everything you need, Mr. Allison? Hey, you can call me "Frank". Good night, Frank. Howdy, cowboys. Welcome to the Bisbee Saloon. Samuel, we got customers. What's your name, good lookin'? John. Well, I'm Scarlet. It's a pleasure to meet you. And who are your friends? Their names aren't important. Samuel, you got customers! Huh? Bye, honey. Howdy, gentlemen. What can I get you? Get my boys a room. And there's more where that came from. Right away. Vilma! Raquel! Girls, get over here. Raquel, honey, come on. And where's your room, darlin'? See you boys later. Let's find out. Alright, now I want you to try and MOVE and shoot. Those bottles are too far away. You can't pick your distance in a gunfight. That's the idea. I want you to try and find a spot. Fire two shots from cover. Just to keep their heads down and then try and get closer. Go on. From behind cover! You fire from behind cover only. Otherwise, you're gonna get shot. You understand? Alright. Go on. DAMN IT! It takes time. What am I doing wrong? It's flat different. You're moving now. It takes a lot of practice. Look, when you get to cover, take a second. Don't rush your shot. Know where you're gonna shoot before you do. See it without looking. Then shoot. That make sense? This what it's like in a real gunfight? Go. You gonna shoot? You gonna answer my question? About what? This what it's like in a real gunfight? Can't answer that. Why not? 'Cause each one's different. That's why. Bottles don't shoot back. Hey, Tommy! Hey! Can't walk very well right now. Sheriff Barr. Why don't you come on in and have a drink? That's alright, Samuel. Maybe later. Wait here. Sheriff Barr's a good man. He don't mind strangers stoppin' over every now and again. Sheriff! How do? Name's "Joe". Hey. How are you? Nice to meet ya. Hey. Sheriff Barr. How are ya? I hope you don't mind us stoppin' in for a rest. We been on the trail a few days, so... Is that right? Where y'all from? We're on a cattle drive, up near Douglas. Just on our way back to Naco, so... Welcome to stay as long as you need. Okay. Samuel, here, he's got some of the finest rooms in town. So make yourself comfortable. Alright. Thank you. You sure do like reading, don't ya? Mm-hmm. Why? Trying to educate myself. And it helps me relax. Hmm. We should get back to shootin'. Frank. Sheriff. Selina. Sheriff Barr. It's good to see you again. Frank, I need to speak to you for a minute. Selina, would you excuse us for a minute, please? How do you know it's Horn and his gang? They got that look, Frank. They're murderers. I could see it in their eyes. You actually see Horn? Frank, I'm tellin' ya. Did you SEE Lee Horn? No, I did not see Lee Horn, but I know he's here. I know it's them, Frank. I know it! I'm sorry, but... I know it's them. You're not thinkin' of taking them on all by yourself, are you? Not here in Bisbee. I reckon I am. You're not gonna help me. YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU SON OF A BITCH! Selina... Lee's here? LEE'S HERE? That's why you stayed? That's why you stayed?! We don't know that for sure. Selina... I know how you must be feelin' right now. Don't you DARE tell me how I'm feeling! If it is Horn and his men, I will handle it. I'm going to help you. You wanna what? I'M GOING TO HELP YOU! I don't need your help. Well, you're gonna get it! Selina... this is what Frank does. Let him handle this. These men killed my husband and my little boys In front of my eyes. And they've raped me and left me for dead. Selina, there ain't nothin' you can do to help. Well then, I can die trying! You don't know what you're talking about. PLEASE! These men, they took my life away from me! Well, look. I'm gonna, I'm gonna head on back to town And keep an eye on these fellas... in case it is Lee Horn. Selina. You're not a gunfighter, Selina. Please, I can help you. No. But you been teaching me to shoot! Teaching you to shoot whiskey bottles Is not the same as taking on Lee Horn and his gang! They're murderers. They'll kill you. Like I said, I can die trying. No. But I can shoot as good as... NO! What are you doing? Where are you going? FRANK! DAMN IT, ANSWER ME! WHERE... They killed my babies, Frank. THEY KILLED MY BABIES! They killed my babies! Hey, we need to talk. Darlin', give me a moment with my friends. Alright. Just a moment. Lee, we need to get outta here, right now. The Sheriff was in here. I'm tellin' you, he knows who we are. Let's go visit the Sheriff, then. Boys! Howdy, Sheriff. Howdy. Good afternoon to ya. You gave me a fright there. I understand you met one of my boys. But I wanted to personally assure you They're not here to cause any trouble in this sleepy little town of yours. We'll take a night off the trail and be gone tomorrow morning. Well... that'd be fine, then. You okay, Sheriff? Yep. Yeah, I'm fine. Just a... You don't look it. Well, I been a little under the weather lately. There's nothin' over there. Hey, Lee! Come take a look at this. Look like anyone you know? Nope. You're sure? I'm positive. I like this guy. I really do. Anything else I can do for you? Ain't you boys missin' one of your men? Scarlet! Send one of your girls down to see the Kid. Where's he at? He's keepin' the Sheriff company. Be a good little girl and send one of them down. Just do what he says, Scarlet. Go. Last round, boys. Move the horses 'round back and get to bed. We got a long day tomorrow. Thank you, mister bartender man. I wouldn't do that. Better cover yourself, miss. Who the hell are you? Where are the rest of your boys? Well, why don't you tell me... who you are first? You killed Will Stevens and his boys. Raped his wife and left her for dead. Now, the Sheriff. He and that whore of his wife, He and that whore of his wife deserved it! I...it wasn't me. I swear to God. It wasn't me. I didn't touch her. I didn't rape her. I didn't rape her, it was Joe. It was five of you. Where are the others? Where are they? Saloon? Yeah! Why did you come back to Bisbee?! Because we wanted to finish, we wanted to finish... Finish what? That's it... gonna kill her... Oh, my God. Is he dead? Not yet. You know, I don't much like whores. So you're gonna be quiet. You understand? Else you'll end up just like him. What're you doing? Back in a while. Unless you make a racket. Then I'll be back sooner. Just leave me in here?! Hey, Pete. You awake? Wake up, you drunk bastard! Wait. Wait. What the hell did you do? Sleep down here all night? Nah. No sleep. Well, hurry up and get ready. We're riding out soon. Gotta go to the crapper. Well, then do it! That's a mighty nasty trick, missy. Pointin' that gun at me. I got no truck with you. You raped me and you murdered my family. I had to. Lee Horn, he woulda killed me. Killing me... won't bring your husband back. Put the gun down. I will give you something your husband couldn't. What's goin' on out there? Shut up and get back in that bed. People are... Hear that, Lee? Where's Pete? He went to the crapper. Ah, hell. Where's the Kid? Last I seen him, he's still bangin' away on Vilma. Go get him. Please let me out of here. Can you just open the door? I've been stuck here for hours! Who done this? WHO? He had a hat on and big, long coat and... You give me a name! I don't know his name! You give me somethin' else, or I'll shoot you where you lie. All he said was about some man, killin' some man and rapin' his wife. That's all I remember! That's all I know. I swear it! Let me outta here! PLEASE! Killed him, Lee! They shot Tommy! Was talkin' about Will Stevens. Think it's that bounty hunter? The one the Sheriff's talkin' about, that Frank Allison? Lee! I need you to go find Pete. If he's still alive, we're gonna need him. What?! I'll go. I told Chris to. And I'm tellin' you, I'll go! I need you on the balcony with that rifle. You can pick of anybody on the roof tops or the street. Chris is twice as fast. He'll be down there in half the time. You do this for me? I can do this, Lee. Get goin'. I'm goin'. What the hell are you doing? I killed 'em. I killed two of those bastards, Frank! Well, I got Tommy Kleiber. That just leaves Horn. We gonna go get him? I'll handle him. You've done enough. But, Frank! NO! Horn's a cold killer. He's not like the others. He'll hit what he aims at. So stay here, and stay down. When this is over, I'll come back for you. Frank?! Be careful. Hello, darlin'. You're not gonna be needin' this anymore. Now, who's your friend out there? Go to hell, you murdering son of a bitch. That's the way you wanna play it. Hello, out there! I got somethin' I think you're gonna want! You know, it's a pity it's come to this. If my friends had done what they were supposed to, We wouldn't be in this predicament. Surely there's a peaceful resolution we can come to. I got a lot of money, nobody to share it with. So let's work something out, shall we? The only peaceful resolution is for you to throw down your guns And come out with your hands up, Lee Horn. You pompous idiot. I got a better idea. I'm gonna count to five, and you're gonna put YOUR guns down. Or I'll put a bullet in her head. One... two... THREE! Here I am, Horn. No need to shoot her. Let her go. The famous Frank Allison. Well indeed, sir, it has been an honor. NOOO! Nooo! Nooo! Get in there! Alright, darlin'... Now I'm gonna finish what shoulda been finished a long time ago. Get off me! Just like the last time. Go to hell! Frank! Frank! Frank. We got 'em, Will. We killed every last one of 'em. May they rot in hell for what they did to you and to my boys. We got 'em. How you feelin'? Well... this is for you. What is it? It's the reward money for Lee Horn and his gang. Lee alone was worth over $500. The big one... he never raped me. Supposed to kill me, but he didn't. I reckon' it's better I killed him then. Take this. I can't take it. It's a lot of money. You can rebuild your life. Live easy for a long time. Where you headed? Up to Naco. After a man for robbin' a bank in Douglas. And back to Tombstone. Is that where you're from? You got family there? Yeah. You take care of yourself, Mrs. Selena Stevens. Hey, Frank. You need any help catching those fellows in Naco? No. But if I do, I know where to find you.
