Gee whiz, The way you spend it, I'll bet you haven't Got over- Over 6,000 or 7,000 left, Have you? Not over that, Dear. Well, it's a lot more Than $10, isn't it? Remember the night We only had $10, darling? Boy! Uh, gunner tells me You got home all right. Yes. Here I am. I'm home. Yeah. That's right. Kind of a lonesome trip, though... Probably. Better than Mrs. Benson's. Yeah. I'm sorry, ann. I'm broke. I'm asking for your Hand. I want to shake it. I know you're broke. I was only teasing. But I know Mrs. Benson Isn't broke. That was lovely Of you, pal. I'll bet you were funny when You were giving it to her. I wish I'd been Behind the screen. Hey! What? You're some girl! Oh! I see. I see now. You do? What? I see what you are. You're all right. And listen, you know What I'm going to do? I'm going to do something That'll surprise you. I'm going to show you What I think of you. I'm going out and grab Some wine and drink to you. What a surprise! Don't kid yourself. Any dame That accepts things like that Isn't a dame. She's something else. Is that joint open on the corner? Never mind. I'll break in if it isn't. I'll be back with the bacon. I'm drinking to a woman. I'm drinking to your mother, I'm drinking to your father, And I'm drinking to the whole Cornfed state of kansas. I've been around him A long time. That's the first time I ever heard Him praise anything but himself. I can't believe it. But you've got it coming. It was fine. Why? What else do you do When there's nothing to do? It's easy to be gallant When you're doomed. What do you mean, Doomed? You should Ask me that. Who said I was a sucker When he was on fire? I've had 5 days To think, haven't I? Don't you think I know He has to get drunk? Don't you think I can think with you? And don't you think, Mr. Gunner, I've tried to walk out? I've got a ticket in My pocketbook, even. I've packed my bag so Many times it's worn out, But I didn't go, And now I'm going To be drunk to. But, ann, you shouldn't Think like that, Because - because it's no way to think. It's crazy. Well, This is crazier. 3 roads face us, and there's Doom at the end of each. Suppose He didn't drink, He slapped her Back again, And he sits around, his Nerves screaming with triumph. He sits around Drinking sarsaparilla with ann-me. How he would Love me. The second road Is worse than that. He's retired from flying And works on the ground. Imagine a man with His heart in the sky Living with a woman On the ground. He wouldn't like Himself very much, And I wouldn't like him, either, gunner. Oh, no. He's in love With a woman with wings. She's got him. I've No way to cut her out. But there's Another road. Yes, there is, And we're on it. We go on as if nothing had happened. He goes in the next race, another bat, Another race, Another bat, Until someday, when he's Not quite so young and quick, She slaps him out, And Mrs. Benson takes Another man home on the train. How do you like it? You know, don't you? No, no, I don't know. I've Only had it for 10 years, And you hit it right On the nose, too. You just sit And wait for it. What do I do it for? Because there's nothing Else to do. He gets you. There's no fun being With anybody else. What's fun about waiting For somebody to die? Every ticktock Of the clock- Still living, Still living, Still living, Still living. What for? I won't do it. I won't love him That much. What do you think I'm made of? How can you expect Me to do that? You didn't say I was a sucker. You said I was the champion of them. Well, I won't be. Haven't I the right To live my life Without being tortured every second? Haven't I? Haven't I?! What's the matter? I'm leaving you, that's what It is, on the next train. You'll never See me again. Don't blow on me, ann. Right now. Give me a chance to make Up for this, will you? No. Come on. Give me a chance. I'm Not used to being married yet. No. But I'll pick up. I never asked anybody To do anything For me before. That's a good start, Isn't it, ann? I won't do it. I've been looking forward to Seeing you all day. Ask the gunner. I don't care. And listen, dear, I'm going to Prove a lot of things to you. We started on that Last party together. I can see your face Before me right now, Sitting there Through all that smoke. We were even flirting, Weren't we? Sure we were. That party is going to End up with you. You go in the kitchen And make some sandwiches, And we'll make believe there Were no 5 days in between. Just you and I On a little blowoff. See the idea of it, ann? Please see. No. Take it easy, pal. It's all right. You Can't blame her, I guess. All that talk of sweden And all that. You know those things Are disappointing. And she tried hard To forgive me, didn't she? I wish she hadn't made me Believe it, though. She was kind of sweet the Way she talked at first. Well, that's all right. A lot of angles To it, boy. Yeah? There's just One angle to it, boy- She doesn't love me as much As I thought she did. That's the ticket when You get right down to it, And there's nothing You can do about that. Yeah, and that's All right, too. Oh, I don't know. Yeah? Well, She fooled me good. I thought I rated higher Than a few days drunk. I'm sorry I asked her To stay now, Because I did ask her. You Were in the room. You heard me. I actually asked her To stay. I did something I never Did before in my life- I begged a girl To be my girl. Hmm! And I didn't beg her once. I begged her twice. Me! A little country girl Off of a kansas farm, And I begged her. I ought to go in there And tell her right now! I'm packed. See all my things? You just happened To come back At the wrong Moment, dear. I was telling gunner how Lonesome I was, that's all. After this, I'll understand. Your life is yours, and the Loudest applause you'll hear of all Will be me in the stands. So, do you still want me To come to the party? I'll make a cheese sandwich if you do. I do that very well. Gee, I'm glad To see you, crazy. Did you really see my Face through the smoke? How's your sky girl? Have you Slapped her since I've seen you? Yes, dear. I know you don't want me To get out of here now. There's that funny look coming over Your funny mug Again. See it, gunner? I don't see why that's Funnier than any other. See? Gunner thinks You're funny, too. You're a big clown, Baby. No other face ever made me Laugh so much before. And she calls me crazy. I ask you. Listen, nuts, I'm going to Do more than look at you. I'm going to Settle down. Yeah. I'm going to surprise You. I'm going to settle down. How, dear? Settle how? Just the way you want it. Jim. I'm going to get That dough back So fast you won't know What hit you. Drake's got jobs that No one wants any part of, All the way from pursuit Jobs to seaplanes. That-a boy. That's a cute Little place to settle down. What do you Mean, pal? I mean, right in the middle Of the atlantic ocean. Oh. Say, who do you love, kansas? You, so help me, the whole ocean full.
