But how have you been feeling? I got sick in class earlier. Really? Yeah, I had to leave. So... are you gonna tell him? I don't know. Would you? All he cares about is boxing. I wouldn't trust guys like that. What is that supposed to mean? He's Donte. He does what he wants. Yeah, but what about what I want? Can I use the sink? Not now. Bitch. (LOCK UNLATCHES) (LAUGHTER, CHATTER) (GIRL LAUGHING) (CHATTERING) It's gonna be simple as that. Plain blue and black. And then, say, you got your "Queen City" on the back of that? It's just gonna say... It's just gonna say my name. Mine might just be my initials on mine. That's it? It's gonna be like my trunks. Simple. Feel me? People understand. Like, they'll know. He knows everything. By the time... By the time we're about to go out of town, they should be shipping in, 'cause them'll take five to eight. Dang. I didn't even know you was coming. It's okay.

(SWITCHES CLICKING) (GIRLS CHATTERING) Think she's gonna be back for competition? I used to. I'm sure Legs has that on lockdown. Don't you think we should... I can do it. Legs taught me her stand routines the other day. I can handle it, Diamond. Don't mess! GIRLS: Lionesses. Watch me for the new steps. The count's to eight. Five, six, seven, eight. GIRL: April? April!

How can something even smell that nasty? At least the girls' stuff never smelled that bad. Look. I busted Donte's nose. What? He's gonna kill you. (GIGGLING) So, do you work here? No. I'm just helping my brother. Oh. Did you know they didn't come to school today? Yeah. That's pretty crazy. You gonna stay on the team? I don't know yet. I think you should. I don't think they can kick you off. Even if we're really bad? You're not the worst. (CHUCKLES) (CLICKS TONGUE) (LAUGHING) Bah! (RHYTHMIC CLAPPING) (HUMMING) COACH: We've all been under a lot of stress lately. Legs and Karisma are both home and doing much better. Diamond has a card going around, so make sure y'all sign it in the locker room before you leave today. I know we have a competition coming up, but I've decided it's better for everyone to take the day off. (GROANING) I know, I know! So sorry, ladies. Practice is canceled for today. Uniforms are in, and we can pass them out on Friday. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey, Toni, don't you live over there? Yeah. Why? You gonna walk home? My brother's finishing up the laundry. I gotta wait for him. Oh, yeah. I gotta wait here for Lorraine. Hey! Can you show me how to do a pull-up? Sure. It's really easy. Start with your arms like this. Make sure you got a good grip. Use your stomach. I am! No, tighter. Ow. Now, imagine there's a huge rope pulling you up. Not you, but the rope. What? Starting your own boxing gym? Just waiting for you. If you helped me out, we could have been out here earlier. Can I wait with Beezy till she gets picked up? Her ride's running late. Pretty please? All right. I don't want you out here by yourself. Huh. If Mama call, let her know I'll be cooking dinner. Call before you leave. (GIGGLES) Shh. Shh! (GIGGLES) (GIGGLING) Shh! (GIGGLES) (GASPS) It's perfect. (WHISPERS) Grab a second one.

You think Legs and them are really okay? (SNIFFS) I don't know. Think it's contagious? Probably. Maybe it's some kind of... boyfriend disease? (WATER TRICKLES) I'm fine though. Yeah. Me too. (SIGHS) I just want to compete. Yeah. I'm sure somebody'll figure it out. (SIGHS) You won't tell, right? I won't. (UNIFORM CLICKS IN DRYER) WOMAN (FAINT): To our captains... (INDISTINCT) We are doing everything we can. We think it may actually be in the water system. Well, we've been drinking the water for, like, forever. Well, we'll deal with this and do some tests and hold a press conference. What I really want to know right now is... Tell me what these episodes are like for you. Well, I had mine first and... There's a possibility these episodes have been caused by unsafe water in the building. So don't drink out of the water fountains. We'll be having a sample tested soon. So for now, just use the boxing gym. There's a water cooler in there that is safe. Also, since your captains have been sick, we had to drop out of this weekend's competition. (ALL GROAN) However, however, you can try on your uniforms and start practicing for the parade. (SCATTERED CLAPPING) It's okay? You can take it from here? Uniforms. Five, six, seven, eight. (CHATTERING) - GIRL: What's your name? - (CHATTERING) Why won't you let me watch you dance? Because. Don't you have a boxing tournament? It's in... two weeks. Oh. Well, I'll let you know.

Shake! Put the peanut butter on that butter. REPORTER: seizure-like symptoms. Some of the girls have even been hospitalized. But health officials have yet to release a diagnosis. West End residents fear the illness may be caused by contaminated water. City officials say they are working with the county health department to investigate. In the meantime, the community center is only using bottled water for drinking. That's an attempt to curb what residents are calling "the fits." We'll keep an eye on the story. Come on! Faster! (CHUCKLES) Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. (GIRLS TALKING, INDISTINCT) Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. KARISMA: Channel 12 keeps calling to see if I'll do an interview. DIAMOND: They didn't call me. LEGS: It doesn't matter. We're not gonna be interrogated on live television. Psst! DIAMOND: They don't believe us. LEGS: Let 'em think what they want. Hey, K, are you still shaking? Sometimes when I wake up. DIAMOND: So what was it like? GIRL: Yeah, how did it feel? Come on! Shh! Actually, it's kind of like competition. When you're really nervous right before the performance, and you kinda forget the choreography? I mean, well, your body knows it, but... I don't know. It's like you almost just stop thinking. It's like time stops, and you're just floating. (CONTINUES, INDISTINCT) (SCREAMS) (DOOR CLOSES) Other hand. We were all just in the locker room, and Madison went crazy. What do you mean, crazy? She started shaking all over the place. Was the whole team there? Pretty much. You guys talkin' about Madison? It was crazy. She was like... (GRUNTS) And her eyes was like... And then her tongue was like... She dropped to the floor, was shakin' a lot. Shaking. Shaking. She twisted for a little time. Twist. She got like that and then like that. And then, zombie.
