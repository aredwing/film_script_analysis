On the radio, five assholes were talking about five other assholes, so that five others could talk about what had been said. Unbearable. So I played the only thing that relaxes me, that stops me from thinking. WARNING: TRAFFIC DELAYS Fuck off, dickhead! That when all started. Because of that damn tape. As if it were the spark that unleashed the storm. What the hell were you thinking about? - Let's take this calmly, ma'am... - Why should I, you moron? Move the car, please. You're holding up the traffic. I'd be delighted, officer, but I've crashed into her ass. My ass? You should be so fucking lucky! Ma'am, let's take this calmly and see if we can get it sorted out. Park your cars over there, it's a restricted area. All right? Let's go! Could you turn off that lousy music? Listen, I don't criticize the music you listen to. The bastard is enjoying this. Do I have to put up with her insults? Right, get out your insurance papers. You, sir... Turn down the music, please. May I see your car insurance? Thank you. And your driving license. Thank you. And your road tax certificate. What about her papers? Look, who was it committed the offence? Ignore him, officer. He just lost it. What are you looking at? Have you got a pen? - Have you got your copy? - Yes, I'm finished. You can go. Good riddance. Information. This is Esther Can I help you? Good morning. I'd like somebody's telephone number. Very well. Do you know the name? Sonsoles Lpez-Daz Garca-Navarro. The surnames are hyphenated. I'm sorry. We have no customer with that name. - You put in the hyphens? - Yes, sir. If I give you the address, can you do a cross-check? What's the address? There is a Lpez-Daz at that address, - but the name is Armando. - Give me the number anyway. The boss is furious. You're 30 minutes late. You told him about the accident? Yes, and he asked if we should send an ambulance. I said you seemed to be in one piece. I'll miss you when you retire. If they haven't kicked you out first. Mario, how are you? Hello. Is it all here? Let's go. Well, at last! Pablo Lpez, who has just ruined his reputation for punctuality, and Alba. Victor Novoa and Javier Barroso, from Oprinsa. Pleased to meet you. Hello. I apologize for the delay, I had a car accident. We were only doing 6 mph, but the woman went hysterical. It wasn't serious? No, I just got her up the rear without her permission. I must go, I've got a conference call. Well, I had it 30 minutes ago. I'll leave you here with our top man. The airport, please. Hello? Hello, who is that? Elsa. Hello, love. I want to speak to Sonsoles. She isn't here. - When will she be back? - Who's calling? - Antonio. I work with Armando. - What do you want with Sonsoles? Look, Elsa, this is a bit embarrassing. But I guess I can trust you. I met Sonsoles a month ago. She came up to my place, had a few drinks and, you know... I wanted to use a condom because I'm bisexual, and I've got very promiscuous friends, but she said no. I had a blood test and I've got... Why are you telling me this? Don't hang up, it's important for your sister. What do you mean, my sister? Can't you hear my accent? I work here. Now that I think about it, it is a bit delicate. I'll give you my number. - Tell her to call me. - What for? So I can tell her myself. Write this down. - 5-6-0, - 5-6-0, - 0-2, - 3-2. RAUL ECHEVARRIA National Securities Commission Her husband mustn't find out. Don't you know she doesn't have a husband? Hell. - How's it going? - I'm working on it. Terrific. The bastard is right. There's a lot still missing. They didn't ask us to go into the second phase. - Yesterday, we talked... - Don't give me that shit, Pablo. You're supposed to have enough hair on your balls to know what to do without being asked. Think of something. I have to go and meet some asshole they've sent from London. It's a Jos Salgado. He says it's about your car insurance. Yes? - Pablo Lpez? - Speaking. I wanted to check some things regarding your car insurance. Did you have an accident a few days ago? Yes, I haven't had time to report it. The owner of the other car has put in a claim for injuries. What do you mean, injuries? We were doing 12 mph. You have to send us your report and we'll study the case. Please let us have it as soon as possible. Yes, of course. The bitch. The bitch! Are you leaving? Yes, it has to do with the accident. I'd like you to meet someone first. Eva Morales, Pablo Lpez. Hello. Eva is from the London office. She'll be with us for a while. I'm doing an audit of the department. But we needn't worry. From what I'm told, we're in good hands. - I wonder who told you that! - A little bird. Well, I'll leave you to it. If you need anything, ask Pablo. You caught me as I was going out. Alba, can you get Eva whatever she needs? I'll see you later. - Hello. - Is Sonsoles there? Yes. Who's calling? - Who was it? - He hung up. 'Bye, I'll call you later. Well! You've finally shown up! They've been waiting for you all afternoon. Have I caught you coming in or going out? Do you come here often? Two or three times a week. - With people from the office? - No. Not with people from the office. So why did you bring me here? I don't know. - Coincidence? - Yes. I believe in coincidence. Do you? No, I don't. You're the kind who looks for good reasons for everything. I can't tell you what I'm like. Get to know me and find out for yourself. - I'm sorry, I've had a bad day. - Don't worry. I'm an auditor, I'm used to being disliked. Do you like your work? They pay me well. Yeah. - So it isn't vocational. - Raking over others' misfortunes isn't the most pleasant thing. And you're always moving around. When you get used to one place, you have to move on. That's the worst part. Yeah. But does it really matter? All offices are the same now. - The people change. - The people? No, there's always the same kind of people. The morons, for example. Who are they? The morons? They travel business class, stay in expensive hotels, they're young, well paid... And occasionally they may even get a weekend off. But the rest of the time they're available, like whores. They have to do whatever they're asked and pretend they like it. And while they play along and smile, their life is passing by and they hardly notice. You and me, for example. Well... You've told me what you're like. No. I've told you what I do. Hello? I want to speak to Sonsoles. Elsa, I'll take that. Sonsoles... Let me speak to Sonsoles. Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch. Who the hell are you? Sonsoles. Sonsoles. What do you want, asshole? That's scary. Should I be frightened? Hello, Sonsoles. You don't know me, but I see you every day. I've had my eye on you for weeks. Do you want a date, or to know if I wear panties? No, I'm not that kind of man. Oh, are you a man? Do you know what I want, Sonsoles? I'm dying with curiosity. I want to tear out your liver and eat it fried. I'll give your heart to my dog, and my monkey can play with the rest and stop jerking off. In the meantime, I'll be around, my dear. You should be careful. - I'm going to call the police. - And what will you tell them? I'm in a booth, far from my home, you don't know who I am. You know how many cases like this are filed every day? They'll wait till I do something to you. I know you. - Come off it. - You're nothing but garbage. I'm much more than that. My monkey sends you a kiss. He wants to meet you. - Hello. - Hello. - Thank you for coming. - Not at all. It's nice to see you. You look lovely. As for those phone calls, it's probably some idiot who'll get tired of the joke, or someone who works with you. I'm scared, he called again. A judge can't do much if you've only had a few threats. I can't just sit back. I have to do something. You have to help me. Very well. I'll drop by your house later. I'll bring something to hook up to the phone. I have to go now. Goodbye. - Make sure no one's coming. - All right. Do you want to smoke? All right. - Will you let me have a drag? - Sure. Right, that's it. Give me a light. Hello, Mara! You want some, or does it sicken you to suck what I've sucked? You're a bitch, Izaskun. Listen to our shitty little princess. So it does sicken you. No, it doesn't. I've got my own. I don't need to smoke what a cocksucker gives me. It's your loss. But if you smoke a joint you won't be top of the class and Doa Lourdes won't say you're going to be a minister. I'm not going to be a minister. But I won't be like you, selling myself in the papers to buy coke. Aren't we friends? You bore me, Izaskun. I don't care. Meet up with them if you want. All right. Are you going on your own? Yes, I don't care. - So long. - Yeah. - See you tomorrow. - 'Bye, Andrea. Mara! - How do you know my name? - Don't be scared. I'm not. Who are you? My name is Javier, I'm a friend. Whose friend? OK, I'm a police officer. But don't tell anyone. I haven't done anything wrong. Yes, I know that. It's about your friend Izaskun. I don't have any friend with that name. You're mistaken. You shouldn't try to fool me. I've seen the two of you together in the school yard. That doesn't mean we're friends. Mara, you're a good girl. Izaskun is in trouble. - Wouldn't you like to help her? - Help Izaskun? I hope you put her in jail. I'm not going to put a young girl in jail. The police don't do that. So what do you want? Just tell me who gives her the drugs. Borja. He gives them to her. Borja who? I don't know. He goes to the school beside ours. - And that's all you know? - That's all I know, cop. I don't believe you. And I don't believe you. Yeah. You think I'm one of those guys who spy on young girls and try to see their panties. There's a lot of them around. But none of them wears a tie as nice as that. I thought policemen didn't earn much money. I do overtime. You like coming to the park? What's that got to do with the investigation? Nothing. The investigation is over. I want to hear about you. I like you. Elsa had lunch ready five minutes ago. My mother gets annoyed if I'm late. Of course. Thank you for everything. No problem. I'm delighted Borja is being arrested. You shouldn't tell anyone. Not even your mother, or your best friend. You can't tell my mother anything. Goodbye. So long. Yes? Pablo, it's been three days since Oprinsa blew us out. What have you got? We have to react now. I'm turning the transaction structure around to get a clearer view. All right, I'll tell them that we've got a much better outline. And you're to invent that outline right now, you got that? Mara! What are you doing here? I come every afternoon, for a walk. Why don't you sit down? My father says I shouldn't talk to strangers. I think that also applies to policemen who wear nice ties. Do you always listen to your father? - No. - Well, then? - Your name is Javier? - That's right. And you're really a cop? Yes. Have you arrested Borja? No. We still have to check out some things. I thought you were going to lie. I spoke to Borja this afternoon and he was sitting at home. You're a smart girl. But if you keep standing there you'll get tired. It's late. I can't stay. Elsa has got supper ready, right? You remember names. That's my job. Yes? Yes, I'm on my way. All right. I have to go. I'll tell you what. What? Tomorrow at 5.00 I'll be sitting on this bench. If you're here, we can talk without you rushing off. If you're not, I'll leave. I won't promise anything. I don't usually come here at that time. not a minute later. If you're not here, you'll never see me again. So long. Dream of angels. I've been dreaming of other things for a long time. And I know what you're after, if you think I haven't realized. I don't think you have. And if you don't come tomorrow, you never will. I bet I will. If you don't come, I swear you'll never see me again. All right. You can start the calculations from here. Then bring it back. If I'm out, leave it on my desk. This is everything I could find. I copied it here for you. Anything else? No, thank you. Hello, cop. I was leaving. So soon? You didn't even wait a minute. You always have to wait for women. I don't wait for any woman. I'm leaving. What can I do to make you stay? If you beg, I'll stay. Well, now I know what your weak spot is. Oh, yeah? What is it? The same as guys who go to see girls' panties at the school gates. If that's what you think, so long. I don't care about panties. That's good. I'm not wearing any. What? I'm not wearing any panties. With these trousers you can see a line. Come on. I accept your deal. - What deal? - I'll beg you. Don't go. Come on, sit down beside me. - Have you arrested Borja yet? - No, I'm not after him. I'm after the dealer. Borja's an idiot. It isn't his fault. His father gives him 100 euros a week and buys him what he wants. There aren't enough jails for all the idiots like Borja, or his father. I get 30 euros every Saturday. - You think my father's an idiot too? - Of course. That way, you'll never learn the value of things. And your father? You mean, was he an idiot too? Not that kind of idiot. He's the kind who worked like a dog all his life and never got anywhere. Then he's a socialist. Why? My father says all poor people are socialists, because they promise to take everything from people who aren't poor. - Your father's screwed up. - Are you a socialist too? No. I'm a Bolshevik. What's that? Bolsheviks don't settle for taking everything from the rich. That wouldn't change anything. You have to shoot them. First the rich, then the poor. Shoot all of them. You're laughing at me. It's a joke. - No. - Yes. I'm not anything. And if I were, I'd give it up for you. Have you got brothers and sisters? Five. They're all married except Sonsoles. She's the oldest. And the only one still living at home, unfortunately. - Don't you get on with her? - With Sonsoles? She's too smart to get on with anyone. She never does anything wrong and everyone else is an idiot. You too? Sonsoles knows I'm not an idiot. For any special reason? It's a secret between sisters. I'll keep your secret. It was when I turned thirteen. Sonsoles had a boyfriend. He was about your age. A man with a pot belly and a moustache. You don't have a pot belly, or a moustache. I thought all cops had a moustache. No, the Civil Guards do. - Well, they did. - I'm glad. He was a lawyer. One day, he came to our house in Llanes, in summer. I was changing in my room after a day at the beach, and I saw him at the window, spying on me. I was naked, and he'd seen me. So I got dressed and went for lunch. He was sitting at the table, calling my sister "darling". He was disgusting. Over dessert, I stopped in front of the guy with the moustache and told him if he wanted to see me naked again, he should ask permission. Or else hide better, because I'd seen him. The next morning, he was gone. My sister hated me. But she never again thought I was an idiot. Fuck, what a story! I was a kid then. It was no big deal. Was? The bathing suit looks much better on me now. I'd love to see it. - That's what I like about you. - What? You wouldn't hide in the garden like that guy. You'd have come up and asked permission to look. Let's say I like to do things straight out. You want to see me in a bathing suit? - I told you I did. - Then take me to the pool. You mean now? Saturday. I was going to go with my friends. My parents needn't know I'm not going with them. All right. But in that case I should tell you something. What? I'm not a cop. - I reckoned that. - But I'm not a pervert either. What's your real name? Jaime. My name is Jaime. I preferred Javier, but I'm glad you're not a cop. So will you take me to the pool? Sure. Pick me up at the bench at 11.00, on Saturday. I'm going now. I have to study. - Hello. - Hello. - May I speak to you for a moment? - Yes, come in. I asked Alba for some papers, some of the things you did last year. Oh, God! What have we done wrong? It isn't that. It's Alba. Alba. She's chaotic. I don't know how you can work with her. That's my problem. If you need anything, ask me for it. What pool are we going to? There's one on the outskirts. Your friends won't go there. Jaime. Jaime! - What do you think? - It was worthwhile. What do you really do? I work in a bank. Investments. I mean, I'm not a cashier or anything. It must be nice to work in a bank. - I'm going to do Business Studies. - Why? There are lots of job opportunities. Don't waste your time. Take my advice and become a model. You'll be rich when your pals are still studying accounts. - I don't want to be a model. - Why? I'm not that superficial. Tell me something about you. - Such as what? - I don't know. What you like. I like you. That doesn't count. Let's see, I like... I like watching figure skating on TV, and rhythmic gymnastics. - Girl gymnasts, of course. - Seriously. Seriously... Seriously, I like... I like my life until I was 20. I like the first apartment where I lived on my own. It had no heating, and in winter it was freezing, but the views were fantastic. And I like a place in my neighborhood where I played as a kid, but I haven't been there in years. And your job? You're an executive, right? Don't you like traveling, having a pretty secretary, earning lots of money? Look, Mara, traveling is basically getting on a plane to go to a city you never see. And yes, sometimes you get to sleep over. Then you're shut in an hotel room zapping the 40 TV channels until you put out the fucking light. And you only really have lots of money when you don't have to put up with idiots. And as for my secretary, she's over 50 and doesn't have any respect for me. Well, I'd like to be an executive. Your bosses will be more interested in your ass than in your ideas. There's no time to judge an idea. You can judge an ass in an instant. You talk like a disgusting sexist. I've just seen more than you. You don't know what I've seen. That's true. Why did you study to do what you do if you don't like it? I never studied to do what I do. I studied Political Science and Law. I even started a thesis on the Russian Revolution. But I only got half way through because some elegant gentlemen appeared and said, "Who are the most... intelligent students in this faculty?" - And it was you. - I was one of those students. There I was, with a wonderful academic record, all ready to beat everyone. Yes, I learned how to make a lot of money, but I don't know who got beaten. Why don't you do what you like? I don't know what that is anymore. I bet you do. I feel like a Coca-Cola. - Do you want anything? - No. What are you doing here? - Want some? - No. Do you like school? I get on well there, but I'm bored. And your friends? The ones I stood up today? - I don't really care about them. - Why? - They don't interest me. - Your friends don't interest you? No. I'm going for a swim. Are you coming? - Just like that? - Are you coming or not? I'll go with you and I may swim or not. Won't you try it? I feel really drowsy. Go to sleep, if you want. Pablo. Christ! Shit, man, how long has it been? - I don't know. - A long time, right? - Well, how are you getting on? - Fine. This is Mara, my cousin. And Marcos, a lifelong friend. Shit, Pablo, I didn't know you had a cousin like that. But she'd have been very young back then. I'm still young for a lot of things. Aren't I, Pablo? How are you getting on? Fine, fine. I'm the same as ever. A poor lawyer. You should change your clients. It's what there is. Not everyone can be a lawyer for rich people. You want to have a drink? I have to go home. Pablo was going to take me. It doesn't matter. Call me whenever you want. I'm living in my father's house. Javier. Jaime. Pablo. What'll the next one be? It's not so funny anymore. What else did you lie about? Nothing. Bolshevik. A member of the hard-line faction on the left wing of the Workers' Social Democratic Party in Russia. I looked it up in an encyclopedia yesterday. I thought you'd made it up. You see I didn't. Don't laugh at me. Sometimes I think you're laughing at me. Is your name Pablo? Pablo. Pablo Lpez. It doesn't suit you. It's a very ordinary name. Call me. That's my cell phone number. I may not call you. We'll see. Goodbye, Bolshevik. Stop, stop. Wait here, please. I'm leaving. Hello. Pablo, is anything wrong? No. I don't know, you seem strange lately. No, I'm all right. Really, I'm all right. Well, anyway, I wanted to tell you that we're getting rid of Alba. The sooner you tell her the better. Her contract is up this month, right? - Yes. - Then we won't wait any longer. I've told Personnel to start looking for a replacement. Paco, it's a lousy thing to do. Maybe so, but you know the deal. I know the deal and you know the deal. She hasn't had time. - She can still learn. - For God's sake, Pablo. Don't give me generalities, like she couldn't learn. Tell me something specific. Come on, convince me. Exactly. We're doing her a favor. How's it going with Eva? - Yes? - Alba, can you come in, please? The door... How about dinner? No, I don't feel like it. Is that your secretary? Didn't you tell me she was fifty? She isn't my secretary. She works with me. - She likes you. - No. Why are you here? I followed you the other day. I wanted to know if you'd lied to me again. I work here. I know. You didn't call me. I have to go. I know what you think. I don't care about that. I enjoy being with you. - It's more complicated than that. - No, it isn't. What's her name? Alba. Alba is waiting for you. You have to go. Hello? Hello? Show your face, you bastard. I've told you a hundred times. On the 19th I was at home at 8.00 A.M. I went out at 5.00 P.M. What more can I say? - Yes? - Alfredo, this is Sonsoles. Go ahead. He called again. I've got a number. - I don't know. - You don't recognize any name? I've never heard of the company, I don't know anyone there. Pablo Lpez. You know him? Pablo Lpez. Wait a minute. I don't believe it. It has to be the same person. Who is it? The son of a bitch! - I was in an accident with him. - Was it serious? He ran into the back of my car. We had a row. He's an idiot. That's it, then. He was messing you around and... That's it? He was calling at 3.00 and 4.00 in the morning, - saying disgusting things. - Yes, but it isn't serious. You know who it is now. It isn't serious? I bet if he'd done it to your wife it would have been serious. Fuck it, Alfredo, we have to do something. I don't know. What can we do? You must know. Are you going to help me? You owe it to me. Whatever you want. You got the time? Hello? Who is it? Pablo. Hello, Bolshevik. You know I'm not that. It was a joke, remember. It doesn't matter. I like the word. I like it more than Pablo Lpez. Bolshevik is much nicer. Where are you? At work. How are you? I want to see you. I'm glad. Who is it? Andrea. How did you get this number? Why didn't you call my mobile phone? I lost it. Listen... We could meet now. Are you free? Yes. Where? In FNAC, in the magazine section. All right. That's him. Move, move! - Which is it? - That one. - This car is shit. - Come on, move! That guy cut in on me. - You're fucking stupid. - Shit. - Hello. - Hello. Excuse me. - You want a drink of anything? - No. Let's go outside. Why are you laughing? I don't know. It's funny seeing you again. - Have you got the car? - Yes. - Let's go somewhere else. - Where? Your neighborhood? There isn't much to see there. It's new, soulless. I meant your old neighborhood. Where you knew that friend we met at the pool. Marcos. Why do you want to go there? I'm curious. Didn't you live there when you were my age? Yes. I want to know you better. This is like a village. Yes, I guess it is kind of like a village. It is like a village. I lived there. - It's my parents' house. - Where are your parents? My mother died when I was your age. - I haven't seen my father in ages. - Did he leave? No. He's still there, in the same place. In that house. If you want to go and see him, I can wait. No, I'm with you now. Well, when you get used to it, it isn't so ugly. Some parts of it are nice. I'll show you the one that was best. I don't know what it's like now. It's terrific! Mara... I didn't tell you everything I should have. I thought you were going to kiss me. Take it easy, take it easy. Take it easy. Tell her to shut up or he'll kick her head in. Maria, don't worry, it's all right. Yeah, Mara, don't worry, it's all right. What could happen? Listen! The money's in the car. In my overcoat. There must be 600. And my cards. I'll give you the code number. 9-0-9-9. What the fuck are you doing? That's good, boss. You were smart about the money. Come on, hurry up. It's true. There's 600, and three cards of some kind. - Was that the real code number? - I swear it's what I gave you. Listen... Can I have her too? For God's sake, she's a kid. Get out 600 on each card and you can get a real woman. What are you saying? If you touch her, you're shit! Me? Want me to carve you up? What's an old guy like you doing with a girl like her? She's just a kid. Who do you prefer, Mara? You prefer me, don't you? Don't you? Come on, quit wasting time. Give him the message we have for him and let's go. Shut up and hold her tight. We can have a good time. Come on, please! Hey, hey! Please, come here! Come over here! You're going to be in big trouble! You're going to be in big fucking trouble! Stay where you are! Stop it! Fucking bastard! I'm telling you, you're going to be in trouble! Don't be stupid! Please! Please! Manu, he's right. Shut up. She won't break if I feel her up a bit. Don't be stupid! Don't be stupid, please! Please! Please! Please, wait! Wait, for chrissake! Let her go, Ral. Ral, let her go! That's it! I'll give you... - Shut the fuck up! - Please! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Let her go! Let her go or I'll kill him! - I'm begging you. - Get off! I'm begging you! Leave her alone, please! I swear I'll kill you, bastard! Let her go. Fucking let her go! What's wrong, stupid? Would you rather I hurt you? Because I will! Come on, get up, bitch! Come on, Mara! Fucking get up! You've fucked up. I'm out of here. Fucking great, asshole. Fuck it! Fuck it! Manu... We have to move. Come on. Cell 2. Adaptation: D. Mac Closkey LA LUNA-TITRA
