You once told me that the three- eyed devil would control these magic's. Please give it to me. You cannot take the three- eyed devil. It only stays with whom it chooses. No, I can take it from you. And we'll see if it will stay with me or not. Give me the three-eyed devil. out of your clothes. You really don't have it! Shit! Today, that boy will appear in the boat again. He does every day? It doesn't matter. He's not a good kid. You teach him every day, but he won't learn. He has his own karma. You dragged yourself into this trouble... this is your Karma. Magic is like a weapon. Weapons aren't evil. The user is! If you want to stop having trouble, stop yourself first. If you don't stop, it will become much worse for you. Think carefully about this. Once done, this magic stays with you until you die. "LONG KHONG 2" "ART OF THE DEVIL III" May your soul return healthy to your beloving husband and children. May your soul return... What are they doing, Pen? She's calling his soul back. I'll take you home, now. Let's go home, son. Do you believe this? Here's the prescriptions... Hello. Today we'll start with Miss Panor. Rinthong, Rinthong. Take it easy. Please calm down, Rinthong. How is Miss Panor today? She is still suffering from depression. Okay, let's change her medications. This drug could cause side effects for the fetus. Keep an eye on her and report any problems immediately. Okay I will. Od! How did you get in here? Outsiders aren't allowed. Pen, I'm not an outsider, I'm always in your heart. Quiet, silly. Where are you going honey? Wait! Please wait and tell me where you going. Dad told me to visit Ta. He needs help with something. Really? I'll drive, let's go. Crazy Od! Stop! - Squish, squish. - Od! You haven't been back here in almost 10 years. Since your dad remarried. We have all really missed you, Ta. Especially Grandpa. He always talks about you. Say hello to grandpa. Hello Grandpa. You look so much like your mother, Ta. Don't worry about school... I'll look after you. Thank you Grandpa. Ta, take your bag into the house. Ta! Great-grandma isolates herself, since she quit being a shaman. Let's get your bag put away. You can sleep here, in mothers bedroom. Why don't you get some rest and then we'll have dinner. Thank you aunt. Who are you? Huh? I'm asking you! Porn's ghost? What do you want from me? What? Porn is dead? Shit! Who did this? Do you remember that night, Ta? I've preserved your mother's body since she died. Because I believed that someday... we could bring her back. Back? We have done everything. Everything we can to bring her back. There's magic that can do it. I met someone who knew how. Tell me what I need to do. I'll do anything to bring Deuan back. Your daughter can return... but not in this body. We have to swap souls. Swap souls? Yes, steal the soul from someone else's body... then call your mother's soul to replace it. We stole a soul. It was Panor's. It's what she deserved, considering what she did to your mother. So we have been waiting for you to grow up. The ritual can be completed when you say the prayer. Ta... Pray the prayer! You were too scared back then. Now that you're older, we can finish it. This is our family's photo album. There's some photos of you in there, too. And this... is your mom's diary. She wanted you to read it when you were old enough. I think this is the right time. Pen, bring me the diary. Please. Ta, my son. Now that you're older you may understand. I'm sure your Aunt Pen will give it to you... when you're old enough to understand the truth. You have always been the most precious thing in my life. I was ill, and everyone took care of me. Even your father. Mother made this herself. It's good for the blood. I was truly happy for awhile. I'll never forget those days. That was when we all still lived together. Until that woman came along... Why are you here to visit? Deuan's younger sister wants to be a nurse. She needs a tutor. That's not a problem. We just got a new teacher. She teaches nursing. It was made in 1976 and it still looks good. I know. Turn it around and look at the back. Oh! You're here! Don't forget to study your vocabulary for homework. Finished studying yet? Thank you so much for teaching pen every day. I know it's inconvenient. That's okay. I need to get familiar with this area. Ta goes to school next year. Will you watch out for him? Of course, my pleasure. Peek-a-boo! Are you nuts, Od? You interrupted us. Deuan, I caught some fish for you. Thank you so much. I'll cook them for dinner. That sounds good! Please have dinner with us. Kuhn, do you know where I can buy some land around here? I know where one plot is, but it's hard to get to. Of course, where is it? Well, it's my land. I'm glad Miss Panor is going to buy our land. With all those traffic it's not like the old day's anymore. You like her, don't you? I don't know what you mean. I'll agree if you want to bring her here as another wife. How can she like me? Here. Go to this address, it can help you. Deuan, it's time for your medicine. Thank you. Listen... I have good news! I passed the nursing exam! I can't thank you enough, I really appreciated you're support. And you know what... I can look after you when I graduate. That's alright. My husband takes good care of me. Deuan? Are you okay Deuan? Deuan what's wrong? Deuan! Deuan! Help! Dad! Help! Dad come here. Deuan, what's wrong with you? Help... Help! Deuan! Help! No! - Deuan... Deuan? - What's wrong? Deuan? Deuan? I'll bring you to the hospital! Son, I didn't die from the illness, I was poisoned. You're father killed me. Mom, where are you now? I don't want to do this anymore. I can't stand it once more. The only way to cure this magic is to eat the flesh of the one who cast it. However, his dark arts ability will come into you. This transfer of magic... may eventually drive you insane. May my body be a slave to the three-eyed devil. What's going on with you? You've gone too far Dis, the ghosts are eating you from the inside. Only the three-eyed devil can control the magic you possess. If you're magic is good enough, why do you need my magic, Dis? Please wake up. All the ghosts wake up. Jungle, river and field ghosts. All of the ghosts in the forest and the cemeteries. Wake up... The ghosts of the Earth, Wind and Fire... Wake up, all of you... and help... and... and help us to defend the evil, wake up, wake up, wake up... - Hey Od! - Yes? Did you contact him? Yes, but he wants 50,000 baht. We'll bring the teacher here. Calm down. Soon you can go home. Hurry up, we don't have much time. Someone light the candle. It's been a long time. You're still pretty sexy. Can we start? What are you doing? Od, help me. What are you doing? Pen, stand back. Come on, come on. It's time. Give me your hand, kid. Don't fail this time. Now, start the prayer. Pen! Pen, my girl! You need to hurry, time is almost up! What are you doing? Please don't hurt me. Bring back my baby! Ta! Call your mom back! Now, quickly! You're daughter's soul is now in the body. Why are you looking confused? Deuan! Son... Don't lose this thread, try to keep it as long as possible. Take the car and bring them to the cemetery. Cremate the old body and bury the baby and mirror in the cemetery. What's wrong? Nothing really. I just think you've chosen a good body for her. Calm down, Deuan! Mom! My baby! Help me! You're buying more clothes for your mom? No, it's for me. It's too small for you... You can't wear it! Or is this the newest fashion? I've been meaning to tell you something. Oh! Your pregnant! Hey Deuan... You should try this on. It's so colorful. Ta, you want to kiss it? Kiss my baby... Od, don't tease him. That's dirty. It's not dirty. It's our baby. Dad, want to kiss it? Od! It's dirty. Smell it, smell it! Smell it... smell it! It's sweet. Ta, it's my baby. Ta, we haven't been this happy for a long time. Dammit! How did that teacher get the three-eyed devil? Wicked worms. That's mine, give it back. Go away! Go away! Deuan, what's wrong? Deuan! Take her to the barn. What's wrong, Deuan? What happened to her, mom? She's been dead for 13 years. She's not completely back. She must have encountered something supernatural in the past. Hold her. Alright, alright. Calm down, Deuan. You'll be alright. Calm down, just calm down. If what you tell me is true, I need to get the teacher's body. The three-eyed devil won't accept that bitch's soul. Here's your reward. Take the medicine. Deuan... Deuan! No! You tried to leave me. Why? Because you liked this stupid bitch? You want to leave me, huh? Mom! Fuck! Why they didn't listen to me, I told them to bury those! I can't help you. The three-eyed devil won't accept your soul. Let me take it. I won't go. I deserve this bitch's body. I won't go. I'll awaken the three-eyed devil. We'll see how much you can take. Save yourself, leave the body. Here take this asshole! Stop biting me you asshole. Do you want to die? Look at you now, motherfucker! Hey Deuan! What have you done to me? Deuan? Are you alright? You want your family together, right? Bitch! What are you doing? I want you to see something. I want you to see your family die. One... by... one. How does that feel? I'll make you see and feel... all of their deaths. I guarantee some good needlework. Wickedness! The ghost will kill us all! Grandma, what did you do? You hurt yourself. She's coming! I'll start with your mother, old man. What ghost? Wicked! Wicked! You're a wicked ghost. Come on! Great Grandma! Great Grandma! You're an evil bitch. I want to know something. Old man. How much does your family love each other? Stop it, you bitch! What are you doing? Grandma, I am so sorry... Love each other to death? Od! - Pen? - Od! - Od... - Help me please! Pen! Od! - Od... help me please! - Pen? That's enough. Stop. What are you doing to me, please. Pen... Pen? Pen! Pen! I'm coming! It hurts. Our baby is dead! Don't leave me. Od, don't leave me. It hurts. Don't leave me. I won't leave you, I'm here. Your son-in-law dies next. Help me! Pull it down! Ta, what happened? Aunt, get the rope off of him. I'll try to stop it. Help. Are you ready to see the loving couple die? Stop it, please. Get the rope off of him, Pen! Pen hurry! I can't hold it! No! Od! No! Now it's your daughter's turn. Please don't hurt her. Let us go. I'll never let you go after what you did to me. Aunt Pen... What's happening, Ta? I don't know, aunt. Aunty... Great grandma died, too. Where's your grandfather? Seems like your daughter wants to see you. What are you doing? Don't... Don't do it. If you scream loud enough, maybe she can hear you. No, don't come this way! Ta! They can't hear you no matter how loud you shout. Listen, After I am done, I promise that they're all dead. Both Aunt and Nephew are running to their deaths. Too fast. That's no fun. Fool their eyes. Aunt Pen! - Ta? - Aunt Pen! Aunt Pen! Ta where are you? Ta where are you? Aunt Pen! - Pen! - Daddy! Don't come this way! Bitch! Why don't you just kill me? Kill you? I want you to feel the pain. Like the pain you gave me. You'll feel it. What are you doing? This is what's going to happen... to your daughter! Dad! Don't hurt her. Do what you like to me, just don't hurt her. The pains just started. You both have your karma to deal with, too. Dad! This scorpion will sting your daughter. She will feel the pain I felt. Do you feel it too? How painful the torture is? Do you feel it? My child! Only your grandson is left, old man. You're evil! So what you did to me was not evil? Aunt Pen! Aunt Pen? Why is this happening to us? Are you talking to me, Ta? You know the answer to that question. Now what! Take this one! You started all this in the first place, didn't you? Dis? Don't challenge me, I'll kill you. Come into me. I know how to worship you properly. If you leave now... I won't hurt you. Give me the three-eyed devil... and I'll stop. Now quick! Say it! Come into me! You've lived a dirty life. I've given my body to be the slave of the three-eyed devil. Crazy bitch! You're too greedy. You've filled your body with too much magic and you can't bear anymore. It's going to kill you. I can't help you. Grandpa! Behind you... You understand now, don't you. If you get involved in it, it becomes a vicious cycle. In the end, it always comes back to yourself. So what can I do? I shouldn't have used that magic. I can't take you any further. Listen to me carefully. If you want to stop having trouble, stop what you are doing. Otherwise, karma will come and go. In a never ending cycle. The wheel of karma is run by our own sins. One sin is connected to another. Don't cry. You chose this, remember? Hey... C'mon, stop that! Who needs the charm spell? Myself. I want everyone to love and adore me. Hello? Dad it's for you. Hello. - Hey Ta! - Yo I don't remember gramps dying day? Don't no either. He's dead as a doornail, that's for sure!
