Who the fu...? Dicks! Ah!! Ah! Ah!!! - I heard they found a tape? Did... did you see it? Last year, when seven of my friends disappeared... I... ...I was at that party... for a little while. There were... there were about... mm, 20 of us. Luckily, most of us left. I left before... I wish... I wish they had killed me then. I wish I hadn't left. I wish I hadn't left. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. If... if I tell you the truth... ...you'll think I'm crazy. And the truth is... ...I might be. I'm not so sure anymore. Forty-eight hours. That's... how quickly it can all change. Forty-eight fucking hours and it all went to hell. - Happy graduation! - Say cheese. - Cheese! Do you want to be in one? Here, come here. - I've made an interesting discovery... the last couple of days in the woods. There... there's a fine line, a... a very fine line, between reality... and imagination. And that line has been completely fucked. We're drinking these whether they're fermented or not. That's the deal.: Give me that fermented apple juice I'm good. - Tell me you did not put a car alarm on this! - What? I had it kickin' around. I thought I'd put it to use. - It's like putting a chastity belt on your grandma, dude. - Fuck you. Hey. If you see my brother, tell him I'll be in in a second. - Hey. - Travis! - Hey, Chris! - Happy graduation to you! How's my bitch? Okay. Cool. Um, how ya doin', man? - I'm great, buddy! - Cool. Cool. How's school? - Fucking great, dude. - Hey! - Oh! - Congratulations, big bro, you're officially that guy who graduated years ago but still somehow manages to party with high-school kids. Nice one. - Hell ya, dude, chicks dig college dudes. - Maybe if I could keep the Twinkies out of my mouth for five seconds, I'd get some poon myself, huh? Hey! The fat kid needs to get laid! - C'mon, Nate, I know you got a girl who's got her eye on you. - Don't even try, man. You know self-deprecation looks good on me. - Well, uh, while you guys commiserate, I'm gonna... Oooh. I'm gonna go find Jen. - She's down on the bridge. - Oh, cool. You saw her? You talked to her? - Dude, Jen is so hot. - Thanks, man. - Are you fuckin' that? A little bit? Dude, you don't have to say a word, but seriously, are you nailing that? - You're an asshole. - How can you say that? - Ah... yeah! Awesome! Okay, I'm gonna go find Jen. - Hey! Hurry back, Travis! I wanna shotgun some beers with you! - Hey. - Hey. - Found you. - What's up? - Warm night, huh? - Mm. It feels good. - Kinda wish it was cold so I could keep you warm. - Brrr. - Happy graduation. - Happy graduation back. Your mom would be really proud. - Yeah. How long you been down here? - Twenty minutes. I just needed to get out and get some air. Nate's such a dork. Seriously! You met Rhonda? - Yeah. - I don't know why he thinks that car needs an alarm. - He wants people to keep their hands off his woman. - He just likes pushing the little button on his key chain. It's all sexy. Beep-beep. Were you planning on telling me you're going to Canada tomorrow? - Oh, uh, Jen, Nate and I are going to Canada tomorrow. - You're a smart-ass. You gonna invite me? - Mm... no. - No? Thanks. So it's a no-girls-allowed guys' trip. Except for the girls you guys find at the bar and bring back. - Oh, c'mon, Jen, you can trust me. I trust you. - I know. I found a sucker. - Ah, brat! You're a brat! You're beautiful. - Thanks. - I love you. What's wrong? Jen? - Nothing. Nothing. - I know when something's wrong. - No, I'm fine. - Look at me. Be honest with me, okay? I want you to be honest with me. The last two weeks... ...there's been something wrong and I need you to talk to me. Please. - I'm sor... Shit. - What? - Move your beer. - Ah-ah-ah. Don't even bother. Already saw it. C'mere. You heard about the open-container law, son? How 'bout the law that permits the consumption of alcohol to persons 21 or older? You 21 or older? I didn't think so. Whose house is that? - Uh, my house. I live there. - Do I look stupid to you? At least three people up there told me that house belongs to a girl. You... make one ugly girl. - Okay, Joey, I think they get the point. - They'll get the point once they've paid the price. It's called cause and effect: you break the law, you pay the price. - May I handle this one? - I've got it under control. - Look at 'em, Joey. I think they learned their lesson. Please? - Okay. Sure. You best be slappin' em on the wrist. You better be slappin' em on the wrist real hard, Radley. - Joey. I think he forgets he was in high school once. Looks like you have a pretty good turnout. - I know. I'm really, really sorry. I just invited a few people. I don't know what happened... - It's to be expected. Kids just wanna celebrate. So, listen, tell everyone to plan on a sleepover, because there will be absolutely no drunk driving tonight. Okay, I will not put up with it. And in return, I'll keep this ticket-book closed. - Thank you so much, - Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Okay, then. I'll just be on my way. Oh, hey. Happy graduation. - Oh, my God. - So, Nate, what time d'you get home last night? - Who says I made it home? Touch. - Seriously, Bill, organic milk? - What? It's good for ya. - Hippie. - Alright. You ready for this? Gotta go. - Okay. - Love you. - Love you, too. Getting a late start. Can I make ya a sandwich? - No, thanks, my stomach couldn't handle it. Too much apple juice. - Here. Take it. You'll thank me. - Thanks. - Some advice my father gave to me, Trav: stay out of seedy places and stay out of seedy women. - Oh, look out! That's funny. And gross. - I'm serious, buddy. Be responsible. Be safe. - I will. I will. - Here. Take my cell. - Okay. - Get on the road ASAP. - I will. - Okay. - Alright. - Hey. You'd forget your head if it wasn't... - Attached to your neck. Gotcha. Okay. Let's go, bud. Fill up on gas? - Yeah. - Get your car alarm fixed? - In a manner of speaking. Yah! - Hey, Nate, can I make you PB&J? - What do you got over there, crunchy or creamy? - Uh, it's extra-crunchy. - Never in a million years, Bill. - Trav, you got the cellphone? - I got it. - Okay, cool. - I love you. - Love you, too. Call me when you get there. - We didn't get on the road until after 5:00. My dad was right. It was late. Too late. The sun... the sun seemed to set quicker that day. I don't know... I've always hated the dark. Maybe, deep down, I knew that something was waiting for me in it. I wandered out too far In the middle of a daydream And lost the sun And with the darkness Came the immediate feeling that I should run And that's all That's all I wanna do The moment I realized I was alone And the weight made my hair stand up I heard them deep dark voices calling me To something that wasn't love And that's all That's all I wanna do I heard them walk up This is a stick up - You've been writing in that thing forever. - No, this is a new one, man. The eighth. - That's dedication, baby! So what's today's entry? - A hit list. - Oh, yeah? Am I on it? - Number one. - Seriously, what are you writing about? - Uh, it's just, uh... something I realized, talking to Jen last night. - Oh... that you're hung like a light switch. - Yeah. - No, seriously. Read it to me. - Nah. What town is this? - I don't know if I'd call a gas station a town. - Yes. - Oh... Ah... yes! Gimme that coffee what Coffee what Oh, shit. Ah, shit. Ah, shit. - Gas? - Oh. Oh, yeah. Um... pump number six. - Only got two pumps. - I... I know. Uh... joke. - That'll be, uh... $26.41. - Okay, cool. You have a penny, man? - Why, yes, I do. - Ah, you're great. - Thank you. You, too. - Cool. - By the way, where... where you going? - Uh... our car. - No, where you driving to? - Canada. - Canada? Nice. Fun, huh? Uh... it's late, though. The border closes at nightfall. But you know what? I can help you out. There is another port, about 100 miles northeast... Rosendahl. Open all night. - Okay. Rosendahl Port, got it. Cool. Thank you. - Thanks, man. - I have a quicker way. It's an old logging road and leads straight into Canada, and it bypasses the border port completely. - Thanks, we'll hit Rosendahl... - No. No. Where is it? - Uh... you drive north, just past marker 225. A tiny road... kind of hidden. There's a sawhorse blocking the way, so you see the sawhorse, you move it to the side, follow the road all the way in. Fifty minutes, you'll be safe and sound in Canada. - Two twenty-five. Thanks, man. - Thanks. - Have a good evening. - Oh, man. I'll tell you something: that guy did not shower today. - That guy did not shower ever! O-oh I went down To old Joe's bar room On the corner by the square The drinks were served as usual And the usual crowd was there Now on my left sat Big Joe McKennedy - Where are we? - "A logging road. "Just after mile marker 225. Goes right into Canada. It'll save ya loads of time." - Are you serious? You're listening to that nutjob? Ah... you're crazy. - You're crazy. - What if it's a dead-end, huh, smart-guy? What then? - Canadian beaver waits for no man, my friend. - Pull over? I gotta piss. - No way. - What do you mean, no way? I've gotta piss, dude. - Nope. - No. I'm serious. I really need to pee, man. - This road's creepin' me out and I'm not fuckin' stopping. - Well, it's the road you chose, dude, so please pull over so your friend can pee. Okay, Rhonda's getting a golden shower. - The fuck she is! Whoa... Creepy... - Who'd build that thing way out here? - I dunno, maybe it's for logging stuff? Something. - Okay, dude, really, seriously, pull over, I need to pee. - Oh, yeah. Let's go kick it at Freddy Krueger's raping shack. Brilliant. - Pull over. Stop. Nate, stop. Cool. Will you pull over? I'm serious, my bladder's gonna explode. - Okay. Chill. I'll stop. - Okay, you asked for it. I'm pissing in Rhonda. - Dude, you piss in my car, I will piss in your face. - Stop!

Can you hear me?! - I'm sorry I'm having... Repeat that, please. Hell... - Ah, fuck! Fuck! Chris? Chris, hey, it's Travis. No. No. No, man, we never got there. Can you hear me okay? Okay. Thank God. Hello? Is anyone here?! I need a phone! Hello? - That happened a few miles from here. Why'd ya turn that off? - What? - Sound familiar? They got to you, boy, didn't they? - What are they? - Tell me something. What did they look like? - They were... I don't know. Listen... do you have a phone? - No. Let me help you with that. Alright. And... don't worry, I-i-it's... clean. It's clean. - What are those things? - Sasquatch. - No. No, these weren't Sasquatch. These were... these were people. They... they wore fur like clothing. They weren't... th-they weren't ape things. - Yes! Yes! That's right. That's right, they're not apes. What ya been lead to believe and what is... ...isn't the same. You saw them. The Sasquatch. - How do you know so much? - Follow me. I'll show you. We recording? - All set. - Thank you. We are going to discuss my theory on the legend of Sasquatch. Quiet. Quiet. Alright? Okay, let's get started. Okay, you might be wondering why the press is here today, and the reason is because I have a very special announcement to make. But first I want to go over some specific details, which will lead to the announcement. So please follow me if you can, accordingly. Okay, in the early 1500s, a Spanish conquistador by the name of Francisco de Coronado led an expedition from New Spain, which is known as what present-day state? Going once, going twice, going three times. Sold! To me, Dr. Erik Mitas. For a cookie. Now, the answer is... - Boner! - Texas. The Lone Star State. But it wasn't America yet, mind you. Seor Coronado had heard stories of the existence of seven cities overflowing with gold, located in the unexplored northern regions of the continent. Now, Coronado wanted to get rich quick, so he assembled a team of 300 men composed mainly of Spanish soldiers, Native Americans - and here's where it gets really interesting - Spanish slaves. Now, historical accounts state that these slaves were shackled together at the wrists and the ankles. Now, this is where it gets really fun, alright? For their sentence, their tongues had been removed. Cut off. - Pfft! - This put them in the same class with the animals, leaving them with no speech. So Coronado took his men and split them up into separate groups: one going up into Canada, one going to the Rocky Mountains, just to save time and cover more ground. So something stopped them. Can anybody tell me what it was? - Bigfoot! - No, Todd, it wasn't Bigfoot. Do not say the "B" word in this classroom. The proper term is "sasquatch." Okay? And wrong again on the answer. Sasquatch didn't even exist at that time. Winter is the correct answer. So one group headed east toward Kansas. The other group, further north, had a more severe predicament. Freezing weather and a dwindling food supply brought Coronado to an extreme decision. He abandoned the slaves, and returned empty-handed to Mexico. - Sounds like a nice guy. - It was brutal and cruel. They were shackled together in freezing weather and sure to die. Here's where my theory comes into play. I believe these slaves didn't die. Their will to survive forced them to adapt to their new environment. It is well documented that in that very same year mysterious predators began stealing women from the Salish and Kootenai Indian tribes. These predators became labelled as? - Bigfoot? - Todd, you're pushing your luck. Sasquatch is the correct term in this class. But you are correct on your answer, even though it was the wrong name. So Sasquatch took these stolen squaws and began breeding and then inbreeding for nearly 500 years. Since speech was no longer relevant to them, the parents would remove the tongues of their offspring in a bizarre circumcision-like ritual. Sasquatch, Todd, is what the tribes called this creature: "Wild man of the woods." This is the exciting part. This leads me to my very, very special announcement, okay? I am taking a two-year sabbatical into this very region to find one of these creatures, and prove this to the world. If my theory is proven correct, I will be written up in every anthropology textbook here to come. I will make my mark in history! Thank you very much. Thank you. Opposite happened. He never proved anything. He was a good friend of mine. He gave me that tape. He was a good, good man. Lost all his funding, his... career. Everything ruined, everything! Became a joke in the anthropology world. And then one day, he just... disappeared. - I think his theory might be right. - Nature decided to give these things a shot. Gave them the intelligence of men, but the instincts of animals, the ability to reason, strategize. But most importantly, they learned how to stay hidden. The result: A neo-human race. A new branch of humanity spawning right here in the caverns of America's backyard. - Thanks... thanks for the food, by the way. Chris should be here by now. - You know something? Your... your friend... ...he... he's gone. He's dead. He's dead. - Why do you say that? - No one gets out. You're the only one. I was wondering, you know... I always wonder if I rub this bottle hard enough, if I could clean the inside of it. You need to go out, find a phone... ...call people, tell people. - Tell then what? That... that I was attacked by Bigfoot? - Sasquatch. It's Sasquatch. - I knew it. You're the guy in the video. You're the professor. You sent us out there. You knew those things were waiting for us? You've been sending people out there for years, knowing that those things are waiting for them!! - People need to go out there. They need to find these things. This needs to be found! I've spent my whole life... - My friend is not dead. - Your friend is dead. I've seen it over and over... - My friend is not dead! You hear me?! My friend is not dead! Fuck you! Fuck you! - You go. You... - Hey, Trav. What, uh... What's going on, buddy? - We're leaving. - There's an old guy on the floor. - Leave him. Come on. - You tell them it's real! - You have the guns? - Yeah, they're in the truck. Trav, could you please tell me what the fuck is going on? Where's Nate? Where's the car? - You have the ammo? - Trav! Talk to me, now! - We were attacked, Chris. Last night your brother was taken into the woods. - Attacked? By who? Attacked by who? Attacked by who, Travis?! Jesus Christ! - Stop it! Apparently, last night, Chris, we discovered Sasquatch. - You guys fucking with me? A stripper gonna jump out? Surprise! - No. - Are you serious? But... Sasquatch doesn't exist. - They do. Come on, I'll tell you everything on the way. - Fuck this. Home base. - Home base? That thing? Fuckin' Charlie Manson's abortion clinic. - Hey, check this out, Chris. It locks. That should keep 'em out. - So... are these things fast or... slow? Can we outrun 'em? - Let's hope we won't have to find out. We should head toward the mountains, look for caves. - This thing is useless. Fucking needle in a haystack. This can't be happening. This is not happening!!! Travis, listen, please, tell me, you guys, are you joking? You fucking around with me? Travis, please, what the fuck is going on?! - Get off of me! It is not a joke, Chris! Does this look like a joke to you?! Does it?! Do you think I did this to myself?! Chris, if you don't believe me, then what the fuck are we doing out here, man?! I need you... to help me... find your brother. - Yeah. - Okay? - Sorry, Travis. Sorry. I just... - It's okay. It's okay. - Hey. - What? Hey. - Do you think Nate's in there? - There's only one way to find out. You go first. - Yeah. Oh... Oh, God. It smells like ass in here. Oh... Mm. - Oh, no. No. It smells like them. - I can't see a goddamn thing. - Hang on, hang on. - Shit, it goes on forever. - Yeah. Hey, this is definitely it. - Home sweet home? - Mm-hmm, yeah. - We gotta go deeper. - I know. - That really sucks. - I know. I hate the dark. - Trav... what is that? - Hang on. Shit. Shhh! Chris, stop moving. - I'm not. - Make no noise. Run. We should run. - Run!! - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. - Fuck me! Goddammit! Shit! Travis! Run!! Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Come on, Trav! Are you kidding me?! What are you doing?! Two? - Yeah, they're big. - They gone? - No... they're waiting. - Travis, don't! - Shut up. Okay. I don't see anything. We gotta make a run for the truck. Okay. - Oh, shit! - What the fuck's it holding? Oh, shit! - What the fuck? What the fuck?! Fuck!!! Fuck!! I got it. I got it. I think I got it. Come on!! Anyone else want some more of this?! - Come on, Chris, we gotta go, man! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! - Come on! - I'll catch up. Get the hell outta here! - I'm not leaving without you! - Travis, I'm not fucking around! Travis! - Oh, shit! You fucker! - No! No! No!!! - Shit. Shoulda done this the first time. Oh, shit! Die! Die! Die!!! - So you just left him there? - What would you have done? - They're both dead? Both Conway boys? - Yeah. - Well, is Chris... still there at the shack? Could we send someone out to get him? - If they didn't get to him first. - Looks like we got a trip to make. - I'll go bring the car around. His father's waiting for him, Domain. I think we've held him here long enough. We'll get this all straightened out, Travis. Just go get some rest, okay? - That's quite a story, son. Quite a story. Go see your dad. - Thank you. - No. Thank you, Travis. - For what? - You just made my life a lot more interesting. - We found a shoe. There's a lot of blood, but no body. - No severed Nate head. We found a fuckin' tongue. - Oh, God. - Hey, Domain. Look here what I found in the glove compartment. - Good find, Stilwell. - Wow. They said that? Those kids have... ...big imaginations. You know, I, uh... When you look like this, people tend to judge you. - So you did see them? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did see 'em. For a short time. They came in for gas. They didn't say more than... two words, then they left. I'm just trying to run my business here. - Sir, do you mind if we take a look at your basement? - Sure, sure. Yeah. A little bit more. Watch your step right here. Whew. This is it. - You live here? - Yes, yes. I know, it's... it's messy and... I live a simple life. Don't need much. - Thank you for your cooperation. - No problem. Anything I can do... for you all. - Well, have a good day. - You too. Excuse me. Y-you guys goin' back up onto that road? - It's our next stop. - Alright. Well, I hope you find what you're looking for. - Hey, Greg, come here. Take a look. - The other shoe. - We've got the pair. Tag it, then let's go find that cave. - Come in. - Did you say come in? - Yeah. - Nice to be home? Is it okay if I have a couple of quick words with ya? - Wh-where's my dad? - Downstairs. He said it was okay if I came up for a sec. - Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Could you grab me that water from over there? - Yeah. - Thanks. - There ya go. Looks like ya been busy. - Did you... did you find him? Chris? - No Chris, no Nate. Just a lot of blood and a... tongue. - A tongue? - It was... cut out. Look, Travis, I'm not gonna beat round the bush with ya. That story you told me and Radley about the... Bigfoots... Just... It's pretty crazy. - It's what happened. - Well, um... we found this in Nate's car. I think... it belongs to you. - That's my journal. - Your journal. Yep. And this tells us a very different version of what happened to you and your friends out there in the woods. - What are you talking about? - These are your words, Travis. "It's been eating me alive, this suspicion. "I believe everything was confirmed yesterday. "Nate knows I love Jen. "He knows I would do anything for her. "Die for her, kill for her. - I gotta go. - "He knows she's mine and only mine. "Nate might be placing the nails in the coffin of our friendship. God, I hope it's not true." - I gotta go. We can't get caught. - We're not gonna get caught. Okay, just go inside. I'll meet you upstairs. - Hey, don't start anything you can't finish. - I said... ...I'll meet you upstairs. Bye. - "Nate and Jen were alone together on the bridge. "When Nate met me in the party, "he seemed nervous and fidgety. "Perhaps from his guilty conscience, or perhaps my paranoia." "Jen looked gorgeous on the bridge. "She is so beautiful. I can't imagine that beauty belonging to anyone but me." - Warm night, huh? - Mm. It feels good. - Kinda wish it was cold so I could keep you warm. - Mm-hmm. Brrr. - "I kissed her, taking in her beauty, "letting it fill me. "But then I tasted the cigarette in her mouth, on her lips. "Jen doesn't smoke. Never even tried it. "Paranoia? I'm not so sure." You write all this, son? - Yes. - So you suspected Nate and Jen of... - Maybe. I... I didn't know for sure. What is this? - Be patient. I was patient. I listened to your story. Now you need to show me the same respect. "The road to Canada." "I feign positivity, I smile, "but this whole issue with Jen is ripping me apart. "I keep trying to bring it up to him, "I just wanna discuss it. "This was one of the reasons I suggested "we go on this road trip, to figure all this bullshit out. "I'm screaming inside... "and you're oblivious. "It's festering, this anger. "I feel like I'm going out of my mind. I'm going to erupt." Journal ends there. Travis? - Yeah. We were attacked right after that. - Nate was attacked. I'm not so sure you were. - What? - This is my theory, kid, and it's just gettin' good. - I have to piss. - What do you want me to do, hold it for you? Pull over, man. - No, man, this road is creeping me out. Are you sure this is a shortcut? - Yes. Dude, I take it every time I go to Canada. Trust me. - Fine. Fuck it. My teeth are floating. - Hey, Nate. When you had Jen, did you enjoy it? D'you like fucking her? I'm fucking you now, Nate! I'm fucking you now, Nate! Look what you did. Look what you did! - Now ya had Nate out of the way, didn't ya, Travis? On your way back to the gas station, you come up with a story. You and Nate were attacked, the car was totalled, you barely escaped with your life. Those "Bigfoots" really messed you up. You told that story with such conviction, it was very believable. Which is perfect... for luring your next victim out to the woods. - Chris, come here! Look at this! Look. Look down. Watch out for the glass, okay? You see it? - What? - Chris, I told you to watch out for the glass, buddy. You never listen. What'd ya do that for?! Say hi to your brother for me, okay? Ooh... that's gonna be kinda hard to do without a tongue. Ugh. - So why'd you kill Chris? That was a tough one for me to figure out. But I did. We'll get that soon enough. "He knew I would do anything for her. Die for her, kill for her." You... you wrote those words. You okay? 'Cause this story seems like it's a little upsetting for ya. Just a second. Got this one from your dad. It covers most of your junior-high years. You were a... a sad, sad kid after your mom died. Had a lot of depression. - You'd forget your head if it wasn't... - Attached to your neck. Gotcha. - A lot of good drawings in here. I find... I find this one especially interesting. Who... who is this, Travis? - You're so cute. - Listen... Rachel, um, I know... I know you just broke up with your boyfriend and I know this might, uh... be overstepping some bounds. Um, but I know if you went out with me, like, just once... - Darren? Um... Darren, are you filming me? - That's Rachel Redwood. She was my neighbour. I had a little crush on her in eighth grade. What? - I'd say you had more than a little crush on her. There's gotta be 20 pages devoted to her in here. She was at a party a year ago where seven kids disappeared. A party you told us you attended. - Yeah, I left before... - Listen to what I have to say. - What are you doing? - Which brings us back to Chris. Chris and Rachel dated for three years, according to this... and you really envied Chris for that. You felt like - quote - "This girl was meant for you and only you." Chris and Rachel broke up the night of that party. He took off, or you would've killed him then and there. Instead, you took everyone else out, including Rachel. - You are so wrong. - Jealousy's a terrible thing to harbour, Travis. - That's ridiculous. - You have no room to talk about ridiculous, son. The forest is an interesting place, Travis. It gets darker and darker, the deeper you go. Sometimes you find something that's been hiding. But your mind... so many more places... for things... feelings to hide. When you get lost in there, some of those things find you, they can be dangerous. Way more dangerous than some bullshit monster. You know what I'm saying? You... You're the monster. The monster... in here. - Why don't... why don't you arrest me? - It'll happen soon enough. - No, it won't. I'm telling the truth. There were Sasquatch. They exist. - Do you think we're all fucking morons, son? Go ahead, keep telling that goddamn story. I'll keep tellin' my version. The main difference is mine's believable. Sleep well, Travis. - Travis?! Travis, stop! - Case closed, Joey Domain. - Yeah. Domain. Can you hear me? - Yeah. Where are ya? - I'm on the highway. I found something. - You find a body? - Y-y-yeah. Yeah... um... I, um... To be honest, Domain, I... don't know what this is. But it's in the exact spot where Travis described hitting the thing with his truck. - Okay. Bring it in. We'll get DNA testing as soon as possible. - Yeah, I don't know. There's a lot of hair and fur, and I think it could be clothing or something, but... I'm not really sure. Honestly, Domain, this could make or break the kid. Call me crazy, but... I think I believe him. You're crazy. Twenty to one, it's Nate. He chopped him up... tore him up a car or somethin'. - Yeah, I'll take that bet, Domain. - Alright, bring it in. - Will do. I just have one more place to check out. I'll see you soon. - Good job, Radley. Real good job. - Uh... hi. Um... my name is Travis Brooks. It's June 9. Um... morning. Right before my mother passed away, she sat me down... and she said... She must've had the feeling that she was gonna go, because she said, "Travis... ...the most important thing you can give to anyone is to be real... and be genuine. Don't ever compromise who you are." And I have not. I never have compromised myself. There are things in these woods. And they are as real as you and me, and they are taking people. I'm not a liar. And I'm... I don't think I'm crazy. I know it must... ...be hard for you to believe what I told you. So I'm gonna show you. - Oh, God. Hello?
