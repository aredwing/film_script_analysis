(CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Do you wanna hear a joke? Yeah. Okay. A guy walks into a bar. And he says to the bartender, "Give me ten shots." And the bartender says, "Ten shots? You really, really want ten shots, dude?" And the guy's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. "You know, you'd want ten shots too if you had what I have." So the bartender sets up ten shots. Guy throws back all ten of 'em. The bartender leans in and he says. "I gotta ask, man. Wh... what do you have?" And the guy says "75 cents." (CHUCKLES) That's good. (UPBEAT MUSIC) I'll be right back.

Chemical Biological Defense, Homeland Security. I have something you need to hear. JAFFE: Mankind is a bacteria that needs to be obliterated. Locusts will tear at your flesh and chew on your bones. A new beginning, an eternal night, wrath like never before cleansing society and all I ever wanted was to feel. To feel anything, pain, love, anger. I am death. I am disease. I am the end. I am death. I am disease. I am the end. I am... The Bureau started getting threats from Jaffe a little over a year ago. He was just a nut job at first, then he started sending a tape a day. My God. His threat level went from elevated to sociopath. Why is the government involved in this? Because last month he was a run of the mill sociopath, now he's a threat to national defense. So he's planning an attack? He's way past planning; We're trying to contain it. Contain what? A highly contagious viral pathogen. A 100% mortality rate. Beyond that, we have no fucking idea. Okay, so you're saying he's spreading a disease? No, I'm saying he is the disease. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, shit. Let us know if something comes up. Detective Young. Yeah.

I got his license plate number. And I gave it to the cops and now he wants me dead. He drugged me at the bar last night and... That guy is fucking out of his mind. He threatened me, he threatened my family, you. What's happening to us? BJ infected Samantha, Samantha infected me and now we're both sick. But we never... Oh, my God! I kissed you. Yeah. It's my fault. Look, I would take you to the hospital but they're quarantining everybody. No one's getting out of there. We gotta find BJ. If we find him, he might have a cure. He's not showing any of the symptoms or signs of whatever this thing is. Mrs. McCormick? Is everything okay? Mrs. McCormick? Mrs. McCormick? Oh, no. What is that? (GROWLING) Mrs. McCormick? It's the police. Your grandson sent us to check on you. What the fuck? (SCREAMING) (GUNSHOTS) Do not move. If you move, I'm gonna shoot you! Do you understand me? Freeze! (SNARLING) Oh, fuck!
