My name is Jackal. And what is Jackal offering today?! No man has set foot on this beautiful land since the war. And why? Are you wondering why this has not happened?! Why children's careless laughter can't be heard here anymore? Why can't we hear the country girls' cheerful singing?! Why noble boyish games of rope pulling aren't played here any more. Why gentlemen? Because, now, this land is ruled by - what? Come on - mi, mi, mi... - Mines! - That's right! A landmine is a small and dangerous creature, which once set off causes spiritual and great physical pain! But what have we down there, ladies and gentlemen? One of our brave gladiators, who will cruise through this field of death... ... cross and along, only for you... Only for you, ladies and gentlemen. Across and along! If he does not make it across we will be satisfied with along. All is in the game. Alive or dead. Arm, leg, nose or an ear... All is in the game and all wins. Slowly, ladies and gentlemen! Stay in that area. That is the audience area. Don't go any further. We are here to set up the rules. This mine field is divided into three parts. The slope on your right side is filled up with mines. The plateau in front of you grows more mines than grass. On your left, the birds in the air aren't safe. So... Around this mine field, our gladiator will move - constantly! He will spend a minute in each of these mine fields, but how, ladies and gentlemen?! Without stopping! That's why we should give a warm welcome to our champion, first time driver in the field of death. Winner of numerous cross races. Let's give our champion a hand! You're screwing with us, Jackal. So, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, to your right... There are no mines here. Gentlemen, what is important... This is not a mine field, not by a long shot! Sir, we are not stupid! - You claim there are no mines here?! - I said there are no mines here. Okay, then... Get the sheep! They don't believe it... Let's go... Come on! Get out! There you go... People, I am telling you there is no min... There'll be roast! You little piece of shit... Ladies and gentlemen, what has Jackal told you? What has Jackal told? Let the game begin! I wish you a lot of winnings. Go Jacky, champ! Dollars, yens, euros... convertible marks... Everything plays everything wins. - Alive or dead... - Dead! What is this? Didn't we say without stopping? Drive! What is this? We said no stopping. Again! What are you looking at? Drive! Again! Go! Again! Again! Go! There he is! He's alive! He's alive! Bravo, maestro! You really are good. This is yours. We'll make a good business, you and I. I'll call you! And, ladies and gentlemen, does Jackal lie? Is Jackal a fraud? Everything is fair and square here. Good luck. Let the game begin! Dear son, you've waited a long time, but finally it came. Now, you work hard and earn your pay honestly. Have them respect you at the company. And thank God he has looked down on us... ...so we can live a normal life again... At cast to the first paycheck! Here! ... to my father Esad.
