Collaborating with the Turks are traitorous Romanian nobles, a privileged class of men who seek profit at the expense of their fellow countrymen. Hungary, fearing further Turk aggression, has raised an army of Romanian patriots to drive the Sultan's forces out. Our commander Prince Vlad Dracula, feared by his enemies, who know him as "Vlad Tsepesh,"- Vlad the Impaler- yet beloved by his own people. And he has returned to battle the Turks and crush those nobles who support them. Hurry up! Vlad Tsepesh is coming! Hurry up! Vlad Tsepesh is coming! Hurry up, hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! God damn it! You are a traitor to your people. And a thief. I... I didn't. These are now yours. Noooo! Nooo! Nooo! Noooo! I've sent you messages. You've disregarded them. Father Stefan, I am fighting a war. You cannot ignore the Church. We shall see. If the Church denounces you, when you die they will drive a steel spike into your heart as one of the godless. And neither your son, nor his sons nor his sons, will ever be accepted as Prince of Romania by the people. Thus, I recommend a morsel of humility with the Church. You've never met these men before. They only know you by reputation, as Vlad Tsepesh or The Impaler. You must tell your story honestly and completely, if you expect absolution from the Orthodox Church. But I don't expect it. They know the Pope helped finance this campaign. I am fighting to free their country from Turk tyranny! These men ought to thank me, not question my methods or allegiances! Prince Vlad Dracula, having performed many cruel and unspeakable deeds, is charged with conspiring and colluding with the Papacy in Rome and of abandoning the eternal world of Orthodoxy. In converting his own faith- to join into matrimony with a Roman Catholic woman, he has forsaken the truth and the light and accepted darkness. My views on the Roman Catholic Church are no secret. The Pope and the Sultan stink alike. Vlad Dracula, in the event of your death, would you want your son to succeed you? Of course. Then he will need our protection, not the Pope's. For without our blessing, he'll never become Prince of Romania. And your dynasty will end. We have questions that you will answer. Where were you born? My father's house... Castle Dracul, in the region of Transylvania. We are particularly interested in the circumstances of your birth. Vlad: I know what you are implying. You needn't waste your time. I've heard the folk tales. Who first told you these stories? Your mother? Hardly. My mother died offever when I was two. And your father? My father was in charge of my education. If I was destined to be the Anti-Christ I'm sure he would have mentioned it. I could do no wrong in my father's eyes. Good, Vlad. It was not the same with my brother Radu, however. Come on, Radu! Come on! Fight! Be a man! Come on, Radu! You are not a baby anymore! Finish him, Vlad. Finish him! One day, my father gave me his ring that commemorated his induction into the Order of the Dragon. Wear this always. It will keep you from harm. If anything ever happens to me, see King Janos in Hungary. He is a friend. Why did your father assume something might happen to him? The Turkish Sultan was demanding his yearly tribute. and 500 young boys. As Prince of Romania, my father was refusing. He was leaving for Tirgoviste to meet with our country's nobles, and convince them to unite against the Sultan. I remember asking... Is that possible? To unite the nobles? Many have made separate arrangements with the Sultan. They profit. But their people are no better off than slaves. Greed is a force more powerful than any army. As long as we are forced to pay tribute, we will never truly be free. Vlad, while I'm away, you must look after Radu. He is weak, but he is your brother. Guard and protect him with your life. I promise, Father. No! After what seemed like days of travel, we finally arrived at the Turkish camp. For the first time in my life, I saw the world... naked and unbridled. It terrified me. Do you know who I am? The Sultan Mehmed. And do you know why you are here? Because our father refused to pay tribute. Precisely. When he relents, you may be returned to Romania. Meanwhile, you have no reason to fear me. You will be allowed to keep your Jesus. You will be also taught Islam, and many other useful things. The Sultan's immediate interest in Radu was quite obvious. This one. You are a very lucky boy. When history will be written, I will be placed alongside Alexander, Caesar, and Hannibal. No! Mmmph! I saw less and less of my brother after that. One night, he came to me in tears. Father's dead. Who told you that? The Sultan. - He's lying. - No. Vlad, it's hideous. What? Radu? He was murdered. Buried alive. I told Radu that if Father was dead, they would have no reason not to kill us. Stefan: But your father had been murdered, supposedly by Romanian nobles, because your father Vlad Dracul refused to accept the nobles' compliance with the Sultan. Yes. And yet the Sultan Iet you live. I made myself live. They starved me, they beat me, they tortured me. They threatened to blind me unless I surrendered to the Sultan. And then one day, as if by miracle, your suffering ended. I was given a horse and supplies, and ordered back to Romania. But instead, as my father had instructed me years ago, I decided to seek help from King Janos of Hungary. As I left, I made three vows: to avenge my father's murder; to unite my country; and to liberate Radu from the Sultan. Tell King Janos that Vlad, son of Dracul, is here to see him. Give him this. Your father was a politician to the marrow. Unfortunately, he ended up being all things to no people. Do you know who killed him? Such is the nature of politics in the Balkans. One never really knows who one's enemy is- - aside from the Turk, that is. - Your Majesty. Aside from the Turk, your real enemies are the Romanian nobles who aid the Turkish Sultan. These are the same men who murdered my father. And how can you be so sure- so sure it was the nobles? Because had my father fulfilled his mission, it was them who had everything to lose. And your mission? Is it one of a patriot or of a vengeful son? Both. You see, he wasn't just murdered, Your Majesty. They say he was buried alive. King Janos. Help me. With your support, I can make Romania strong. Come. We should not discuss such matters on an empty stomach. Oh, young man, where did you learn your table manners? If you're asking about my origins, I was born in Transylvania. - Romania. - I know where it is. I am Romanian. You are Romanian? Yes. Of noble class? Aron, like your father, wishes the Turk driven from his country. I've offered him sanctuary, and he has accepted. - Where is the boy's father? - My father is dead. Murdered. Your father was Prince Vlad Dracul? Yes. He was a great man, but his vision was utopian- unpractical in these cursed times. What Romania needs is a saviour. Aron, what news of the Messiah? The Messiah? You haven't heard the Romanian tales? This man who's going to save us from the Turk. No, Your Majesty. In religious matters, I rely on my daughter for information. And you, Lidia? No, Your Majesty. But when I get to Braila, I will inquire. Why are you going to Braila? I'm entering the nunnery. Why? Are you allowing this? It's what she wishes. Perhaps you would let him... dance with your daughter. Oh, well... it's been so long since my daughter danced, I'm afraid she's forgotten how. Then she's met her match. I doubt if Vlad Dracula ever learned. Unless of course, he had lessons in the Sultan's prison. Indulge me, Vlad. Before she renounces the world forever. You had never known another woman, and yet you were sure at that moment you were meant to spend your life with this one? Not just my life. All eternity. Don't go to the nunnery. Your place is with me. You're mad, aren't you? I knew the moment I saw you... as if God himself ordained it. Or the devil. Surely he was the one who loosened your tongue. To win your heart... I will accept help from any source. Will you walk with me? I will walk with you. You've given me back my life. Vlad Dracula, after considering your request, I have decided to grant it, and bestow upon you money and arms. I order you to raise an army of your fellow countrymen, and to wage battle against the Turk and all who support him. Thank you, Your Majesty. I will not fail you. I must remind you, young man, your own father tried and failed. He once told me greed was a stronger force than any army. But I've learned there is another even greater force. And what's that? Fear. Stop! Stop! You! Let him go! Thank you. Not that I needed it. You needed it. Are you hungry? Bread. We've got fresh bread! Mercy! Mercy! I've done no wrong. I've done no wrong! Mercy! Thank you. Tell me, who is that man? Prince Karl. Whatever happened to the old Prince, Vlad Dracul? What happens to every Prince of Romania: killed... by those who would benefit. Come. Those people, what was their crime? They committed no crime. Then why? Because that is the way things are done here. Take him away. - Not any more. - Friend, talk like that will get you killed. What is your name? Bruno. Bruno. Come with me. We have much to discuss. What do you want? Guards! Tell me. Whatever you wish, it's yours. I'm the Prince, and can make it so. Guards! Who are you? Guards! No. Please, no. I lived here once. I am Vlad Dracula, son of the great Prince Vlad. And in the name of my father, I hereby reclaim the throne of Romania. My only allegiance is to you, the people. My will is to end Turkish oppression and the betrayal of those who benefit. What I do will bring justice and freedom to all Romanians now! You priests, you're privy to the thoughts of your flock. What do the people say of me? Not the common man, people of wealth and influence. What do they say? They respect you. In spite of my friendship with the King of Hungary? A Papist? No man of property speaks ill of me? Not in our experience. You. What did you hear? I have heard that you are a man who is vindictive. And you believe that? I believe what I see. A skeptical priest- how refreshing. Then you must have seen God with your own eyes. I have known God. And did He speak to you? Tell me, what did God say? God speaks through the prophets, and the prophets have said that a man will come again... who will deliver peace. A Messiah. Or... an Anti-Christ. One who is only cloaked in peace, but who will deliver terror. What is your name, Priest? Stefan. You're the one from Snagov, yes? I shall come by the monastery tomorrow for a visit. I wish to continue this conversation. As for you others, my sacred mission is to bring order to Romania. There must be security for all in my land. If you do not support me in my endeavors, you do so at your risk. You say what you think. I respect that in a man. Is that why you came here today, to tell me that? No. My father is buried here at Snagov. Do you know who murdered him? There's an old Latin saying... "The more allegiances, the more enemies." May I give you some advice? You are Romanian. You are Orthodox. If you wish our support, end your allegiance with the King of Hungary and the Pope. My father's grave, if you would. It's one thing to kill a man, but why bury him alive? They weren't just killing a man. - They wanted to crush an idea. - "They"? The nobles, then. My friends. Aron, I want you to organize a celebration, to be held here at my home. Invite your friends. Every man of title. And what are we celebrating, Your Highness? The birth of justice. Prince Dracula's first state occasion. Won't it seem odd if the princess isn't there? The surgeon won't allow it. And wives are not attending. Besides... the talk will be of treaties and taxations. I cannot bear for you to be bored. Then you should never leave my side. No. What? What is it? Oh... I can feel him. I have been thinking about the fate of my land. And I wanted to ask you all something. How many princes have you lived under in your lifetimes? How many? A simple question. You, Andrei. How many princes of Romania have you known? Uh... five? And you, Bordeaux? Many. Too many. And how do you explain that? It's the way of the world. Instability. And whose fault is that? The people? Human nature? The princes themselves? I will tell you what I think. You- you are the reason. Your greed, your disloyalty, your corruption. You might as well be agents of the Turks. - And now, that is all going to end. - What? You betrayed us! You've answered my next question. I was about the ask the murderers of my father to rise. What are those noises- - Princess? - Call the surgeon. I'm having my baby. You have a son. - Hello, my son. Your name is Vlad. He was eager to see you. - Vlad? - Yes, my love? Last night, I heard terrible cries. - Terrible cries? - Yes. The sounds of men in pain. You were dreaming. It was so real. Lidia, it was a dream. All that happened here last night was a state dinner. You believe me, don't you? Of course, I do. As I gazed into my son's eyes, I knew I had acted justly, that he had been born into a better world, purged of the villainy that had destroyed his grandfather. What proof did you have these nobles murdered your father? These were evil, corrupt men. Do you deny that you returned to this place of execution? No. Do you deny you dipped your bread into the blood of the nobles? What's the matter? Vlad Dracula, what's the matter? I have heard these stories so often, I'm starting to believe them myself. Shhh... Tell me these rumors are not true. Rumors? What rumors? What have you heard? That you bury condemned men to the waist and behead them. Who told you that? Your father? No. Did he tell you I cut the breasts off adulterous women and force their infants suck their blood? - He didn't tell me that. - Of course he didn't. I just invented it. Do you not trust me? Lidia, I do nothing unjust. Grave news, My Prince. The Turkish force is invading Romania. Aron's estate is under attack. Where is Aron? He's gone. Gone? Gone. He didn't stand and fight? He didn't defend his people and his land? Are you really surprised? I found them, My Prince. This is no place for a fight. This is a place for a fight. Take prisoners. Take prisoners! Hello, my brother. What shall I do with this one, My Prince? You're gonna kill me, aren't you? You've been a traitor to your own people, - and to the memory of your father. - I never betrayed our father. Besides, if it wasn't for me, you'd still be in that prison, rotting. You have that much influence? Even as a boy? Especially as a boy. What if I told you you could live... if you came back home. If you renounced your allegiance to the Sultan? You don't understand. I'm happy where I am. We will defend our borders against all raids. There will be no more tribute. Tell your Sultan that. You know you cannot win. The next time we meet in battle, I will kill you. It doesn't have to be this way, my brother. This is exactly the way it has to be. He had the Sultan's trust. - He could have escaped easily. - Maybe he didn't want to. He betrayed me and his people because he was weak. Do you really believe- They're all weak. What? They are all weak. My father, Vlad. What is to become of him? When he is found, justice will be done. It was his duty to defend his land and his people. My love, I've never asked you for anything. But this I beg of you. Swear to me no harm will come to my father. Please? If you love me, you'll swear to that. On the life of our child, I swear, no evil will befall your father. What is it? Where is he? Where did you see him? What is it, my dear? You look like you need a drink of water. This goblet is made of gold. Yes. Why does that astonish you? And no one has tried to steal it? No. It belongs to all of us. He brought peace... and the sword. They say he's the Messiah. - The Messiah? - Oh yes. His coming was foretold by the priests. At the moment of his birth, the Virgin wept bloody tears. Then perhaps he's the devil. No. He's neither god nor devil. But he's certainly more than a man. His wine cellar is stocked with the blood of his enemies. Have you never heard of Vlad the Impaler? You must be a stranger to Romania. Yes, I am. Father! Why are you still here? Why haven't you left the country? One needs money to bribe customs agents. - I had nowhere else to turn. - Here. It's not enough? No... I don't want to expose you to his vengeance. Did you really run, Father? Yes. No! Oh God, no! - I know that man. - Lidia, stop! I must stop this. Vlad, no! No! Vlad, you swore! You swore! Let him go. Goodbye, my child. I love you. I swore to make a better and just world, - fit for our son to live in. - Why did you lie to me? - I never lied to you. - Only a monster would allow what I saw in that square today. Would a monster... have let your father go free? - You didn't have to kill that sentry. - That man was asleep on duty. So you had him killed?! Believe me, the next sentry will not fall asleep on duty. This is madness. Have you considered the cost of this justice? The cost on your immortal soul? My soul, my life, whatever the cost may be, - I am willing to pay. - And what about our son? Will your methods die with you? I will not let you corrupt him! - You are a monster! - No. I truly don't know you at all. Don't touch me! - Lidia! - Please! - You're a monster! - You're not in your right mind. Lidia, stop! - Lidia! - You! - Call the surgeon now! The Princess is not well. Vlad, come. Yes, Father. You're cold. Lidia... You cannot go on like this. Get the Princess a blanket, please. Welcome to Romania, gentlemen. What can I do for you? The fact is, Vlad Dracula, you've ignored all previous diplomatic overtures. So, we- Radu. Have your men take off their hats. It is our custom never to remove them at court. Oh, I see. Vlad? What do you think of this custom? I would like to speak to my brother alone, if you don't mind. Vlad, this is your uncle, Radu. Radu is a good friend of the Turkish Sultan. They call him Radu the Handsome. Radu, this is my son. My successor. I have no design on your throne, Vlad. Why have you come back? I told you eight years ago, no more tributes ever. Romania is now free and will remain so. The Sultan grows weary of your impertinence. If it continues, he will attack. Unlike you, I didn't submit to the Sultan's whims when I was a child. Why should I now? So we understand one another? No more warnings. Understood. Let's hope this will have strengthened your customs, and keep them in your land where they belong. - Mother? - We're leaving this place. Do you hear them? Quickly. Vlad, come. - No! - Take the boy. What do you hear? - Cries. - Cries? Of the dead. Begging you for mercy. I am sending you to the nunnery in Braila. It is best for you, and best for our son. No! I cannot leave you alone with him. When your mind is calm you will be permitted to return. No! It was not a banishment. It was done out of love. No one here denies that you are a devoted husband or a loving father. Perhaps even more loving, I suspect, than your own father was to you. Who could say? - Ready? - I am. Shoot. For some time life went on quietly, until one day I was called to the Danube. There. Look at that. What I could do with such an army. There must be - Which means... - ...we are outnumbered 10 to 1. "My darling, Lidia, you are my first thought in the morning, and my last at night. Know that you are in my heart. Always and forever. We've engaged the Turk, and have begun our great and noble fight. Our men fight with bravery and honor. But they are many. And we are few. In the year 431 Before Christ, Pericles eulogizing over Athenian soldiers slain in combat with the Spartans wrote, 'It is for our country that these men die nobly in battle, thinking it right not to be deprived of her, just as each of her survivors should be willing to toil for her sake. And so, we will persevere to the very end."' You need me to look after Vlad now? No. I sent for you because I want your forgiveness. You are so pure and so good. But you must understand that everything I've done in my life I know I was meant to do. Without you, I am so lost. I never stopped loving you. He's not dead. My Prince. Rise now. Wake up! We need you. Take a message to the princess. Bruno. Have I not told you I was indestructible? Your men actually believed that you had returned from the dead. Some of the weaker minded, yes. You were dreaming. Lidia, listen to me now. We must go away tonight. The Turkish army will be here. I have come back for you and Vlad. We must leave the castle before daybreak. You're dead. What? You've risen from the dead. No, they thought. - They thought I was. - Your soul... unable to enter heaven. Or hell. Do you hear them? Hear what? The voices. The voices? They're calling to us. I love you. Lidia! Lidia! Lidia, wait! Lidia! No! No. Please. Lidia. Come walk with me. I will always walk with you. No! Lidia. No! My Prince, what are you doing? She killed herself, Bruno. That means her soul is in danger, therefore a mirror... can steal it. Is that not what they say? I did not know you were a believer. She was. She was. The Turks are rolling out the cannon. We must go. People say I'm a saviour. I couldn't even save my own wife. I'm going to trust you with my son's life. It is my honor, my Prince. Come now. She has gone. Could the river have taken her? It's not strong enough. I need you to be strong for me. Can you do that, Vlad? Yes, Father. I'm going to get help. But I will come back. I will come back. - You understand? - Yes, Father. Yes? I begged to see you. I know where the Impaler is going. And I know how to stop him once he gets there. Who are you? My name is Aron. I once owned property in this country. A man of privilege. Is that why you wish to hurt Vlad Dracula? That, and he destroyed my daughter. Arrange to have this intercepted. So, once again, Romania is under the Sultan's thumb. Your Majesty, I beg of you, - give me your support. - My support? You come here asking for my support? These are in your hand, I believe? No. I never signed these documents. What are they? Promises to your brother, Radu to wage war against my kingdom. - These are forgeries. - Was this also foretold at your birth? That you would stab your one and only ally in the back? I never wrote these letters. Blood is thicker than water, Vlad Dracula. - No. - Remove him! I never signed these letters. I never saw these papers. These are forgeries. And how many years passed in the dungeons of King Janos of Hungary? I'm afraid I lost count. The light, it bothers your eyes? Too much time in the dark. I'm sorry to have to tell you that it's a sickness of the blood. Your father suffered from it. And I'm sad to say it worsens with age. So, are you ready to become Prince of Romania again? What? When you were arrested, you said those papers were forgeries. Well, I have recently discovered that your allegations were correct. A mutual acquaintance of the guilty party. Your father-in-law. However, there is... one... small condition for my support. You must marry my daughter. She's a Roman Catholic, as am I. If you convert, the Pope has pledged to send money to help you regain your princedom, in the name of the Holy Roman Church. Of course, the Orthodox priests will curse you for it. You have a moment to make up your mind and consider the situation as it presents itself. Stefan: And how did the situation finally present itself, Prince Vlad? I accepted the Pope's money, - but never his religion. - You swear that to be the truth? Yes. I need an answer. Whose banner I fight under is of no concern to me. I will take that as a "yes." My Prince. - Bruno. - At last. You have returned. How could you raise so many men so quickly? You are their hope. You've always been there. This is nothing. Many more are coming. How's my son? You will be very proud of him. Tell me. Tell me everything. Radu has been Prince ever since your arrest in Hungary. The first thing that he did was give the nobles back their estates and privileges. He made Aron his chief advisor. It was as though everything for which we had fought disappeared in a moment. How strong is the Turk force? After Radu took control, the main army returned to Constantinople. The garrison remains. Good. We attack tonight. Or did you have other plans? And so you've come back to Romania with the Pope's blessing and support? The people do not care about these things. They all rallied to my side at once. The Messiah returned. I am no Messiah. What news of your brother? For all I know, he's fled to the Sultan. Why would your brother give up so easily? Perhaps he fears me, as all of you seem to. - We all have reason to fear you. - Why? Because of the sheer magnitude of your atrocities. Skinning people alive, forcing mothers to devour their own children. According to your own census, you killed over 100,000 people. Forgeries and lies. Do you deny that you murdered your own people? Those who broke the law were punished. They were Romanian. They were Orthodox. You are now a Papist. We all live under the same God. All but the godless. I will leave theology to the theologians. I have far more pressing business. I have yet to see my son. I await your decision. Father. My son. I'm sorry. Do you regret it, Father? Do I regret what? Mother always said you should have left vengeance to God. That was never for me to judge. Time will tell. Vlad. This is now yours. Sit, Father. - The priests have deliberated? - Yes. Their decision? The Orthodox Church has denounced you. Thank you, Father. Thank you for all that you've done on my behalf. Do you understand the consequences of excommunication? My immortal soul unredeemed, doomed to remain "incorrupt and entire." Neither in heaven, nor in hell. Your only salvation is to renounce Catholicism. What good would that really do... if I should abandon the Roman Church and repent? Then the Pope and Hungary will withdraw their support. And I will be driven out of my own land. It's almost ironic, isn't it? Two days ago, I win the great battle, and just now, with the utterance of one single word- excommunication- I lose the war. What if I were to lead you to your brother? Why, Father? Because if he joined you, instead of serving the Sultan, together you would no longer need Hungary, nor Rome. I have tried. After you humiliated him? After you defeated him, how could he capitulate? But time has a remarkable way of softening the pride of youth. And not only did you spare him, but he spared you twice. He's your blood. He will listen to what you have to say, if you say it in peace. I have no idea where he is. He's been given sanctuary in my monastery in Snagov. By whom? By the very same priests who condemned you. They plan to turn him over to the nobles at daybreak who will then smuggle him out of Romania. What would you do, Father? What choice would I have? How many men are with him? He's alone. Why aren't you afraid? Why aren't you begging for your life like any other man? Because he isn't like any other man. And I knew that from the moment he was delivered into this world. God save me, had I had one moment alone with you, I would have strangled you in your crib. You. You murdered my father. Because if your father was unable to pay the Sultan's ransom- I'd be put to death. For God has said to the prophets, there will come an Anti-Christ that will promise peace but deliver only apocalypse. My fight was never with God. It was with you. All of you. That is why you are doomed, Vlad. Because you fight all of us. You fight your own blood, your own people, and your own church. Because you are the Anti- Christ. And you are doomed. Vlad. Lidia! Your father went to the monastery at Snagov. Alone. I would imagine for your sake. Prepare the bath with honey and spice, as my soldiers will return for the body. And then? Then it will be delivered to the Sultan, who wishes to behead it himself. Beheaded. Yes. As you wish. I want him buried inside this chapel. Your father was denounced by this Church. He cannot be buried in this monastery. Or you die with him. Goodbye, Father. I wanted to thank you, Father. You have doomed me to wander the earth, incorrupt and entire. You've given me eternal life. Will you walk with me?
