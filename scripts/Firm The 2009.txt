We wouldn't struggle to find you mob, walking about like a load of pikeys - in yer moody Kappa tracksuits. - So you grassed yourselves up, then? What are you two divs on about? Bex and his West Ham firm shit 'emselves so they brought the gawers with 'em when we had a little meet planned. Sure it weren't one of your young lot? They didn't look like they wanted to have it. My young lot'd open you up like a village fete, you saucy cunt. Listen. There's over 4,000 Germans booked in for Europe this summer. Unless our three firms go together, they're gonna run us all over. They might run you lot. They'll come undone against us. Shut up. l ain't finished yet. Look, we wanna put on a proper show out there, - then we've gotta go together. - Oh, let me think.

You come and take us out with your top firm, then you can take us on tour. But before you do that, you can come down the coast and pay us a little visit. You won't know what's hit ya. You couldn't hit water if you fell out of a boat. All right. We'll see who's got the top firm. You. Farmer. You'll get yours when we land on your plot Saturday. - And you. - Yeah?

Oh, that's a blinder, Shel. There you go, mush. That's what you wanna be wearing if you wanna stand out in the crowd. Now that is a bit of you, eh?

You ain't gotta stick your fanny up, mate. l could see you was burnt. But he gets like that in booze, he don't mean nothing by it. He just likes people to stand up to him. - Well, what am l supposed to say to him? - Tell him to fucking slow down. Oh, great. He's right about one thing, though. Well, do you wanna run with the foxes? Anyway, l come by to tell you, me and Strides are having a russell at Lips later. - We both want you to be there. - Really? Yeah? Really, yeah.

'Ere, get 'ome all right, mate? Oh, 'ere, 'ere. We had a smashing time after we run you lot. l got the right car, didn't l? Fancy you're the only lag stupid enough to buy a British motor. You still there, boy? What? You think you can just land on us and start taking liberties? You gotta get up a little bit earlier if you wanna catch me out. You're out of your league, mate. You think that l'm gonna stand behind you in a national firm? Not the way you perform. Anyway, you'll have to wait till next season now. So start practising. Yeah, you're still there. l can hear ya breathing. Oh, no, no! You fucking child! Why can't you get your kicks doing something else, eh? Something fucking grown-up? Like normal people. lnstead of running around bashing these idiots up? And you know who gets to hear 'em mug you off, don't ya? lt's me. And l think they'd do it to your face if you weren't such a fucking bully. All right, champ? How's yer luck? - All right, Bex? Just finishing up. - The old man about? No, l think he's still in the feather. Good. l'm sans motor, as you know, need a lift. You got time? Come on. Save me calling a sherbet, eh? Sweet? Yeah, sweet. Oi, oi. Where you goin', Dom? You ain't finished. - l'm just giving Bex a lift. - All right, Bill? lt's Bob. Look, can't he jump on the bus? l need the van. We'll only be ten minutes. Lively, champ. Lively? Look, l'm not being funny, mate, but you can't just chaw me van. - l'm tryin' to run a business. - All right, all right. 'Ere you are. - There's a ching there for petrol. Take it. - l don't need your readies, kid. You all right, Dom? You look a bit peaky. Yeah, l'm sweet. You all right, with your feet on my dash? - Yeah, l'm all right. You all right? - Am l all right? Yeah. You? You got something you want to say to me, Ben? - Bob. - Sorry, Bob. l'm fucking murder round names. l'm only playing about with you, mate. Come on, let's shake on it, eh? Come on. Come on. We'll see you in a minute. Come on, champ. Ta-ta. Yeah, no one takes the piss out of me, champ. Especially not that fucking Yeti. We're gonna give him the surprise of his life, in't we? Know what l mean? Yeah, they got Forest away on Saturday. Means they gotta go through London Bridge station. That's where we land on 'em. Yeah, you watch. l'm gonna annihilate that Yeti. What's the matter with the missus? Rumping someone else? To be honest, mate, l ain't exactly flavour of the month, am l? That car was our wedding money. Yeah, know the feeling, mate. Little Sammy got hold of me Stanley, stuck it in his mooey. Fuckin' hell! ls he all right? Yeah. Just means more sweets, don't it? Yeah. - Anyone quoted you on it yet? - Nah. Nah, not yet. Thought l'd do some work on it myself first, you know? Then get the insurance in. Make it look like a proper write-off. - Bit like the Yeti, eh? - What? He'll be a write-off when we've finished with him. We're going back over there Saturday, good little unit. Didn't Trigger tell you? What's the matter with you? Look, Bex. Don't you think all this is getting a bit out of hand? Your car, my car. Usef getting cut. You seen him? He's had 20 fucking stitches down his face. So? This is payback time, innit? You can take it out on the Yeti yourself if you like. Nah. Not for me, mate. Look, l've got too much to lose. - Oh, what, and l ain't? - Look, Bex. - l ain't bottling, all right? - Nah? Well, it come like that to me, star. Oh, well. Done the Yeti's pal for Usef. Might as well do the Yeti for you. Don't do nothing for me, mate. Just leave it. Fuckin' hell, Bex. The Yeti's still gonna be there next season. Yeah, but you won't. Cos from now on, you don't come anywhere with us. l don't want to see you on the plot, l don't want to see you talking to any of my firm. What are you getting so heavy for? lt's just a game of football. Well, it ain't a fucking game to me. You're breaking my heart, Snowy. l'm gonna do that Yeti if it kills me. Without you. l make a bad enemy, Snowy. Avoid me. Fucking geezer. Start the car, bollocky. You can drop me round me mum's. Yeah, thanks for that, champ. See you at the meet, eh? And get some sleep and all. You need your wits about ya. - Bex. - What, mate? - l'm supposed to be... - Supposed to be what? You can't miss this. This is where you really make a name for yourself. - Yeah, but, Bex... - See you there. - l'm supposed to be helping me dad. - Nah. Nah, you'll be there. Ta-ta, champ. Mum, it's me. - l should stick a Tampax in you. - Why? Cos you're a cunt. - Wish it was that easy, Tel. - lt is that easy. Just drop him out and stop playing the big man. You don't know what they're like, mate. - l know one thing. - What? l want my mate back. Yeti. Yeti! Yeti! Yeti! Yeti! Yeti! Yeti! All right. All right. Sweet. All right, James? Sweet? Hand them out, Dom. - Sweet? - Bex. - Hello, Bex. - Bex, you all right? - Yeah. - Good to see you, mate. You're up for this, all of ya? Eh? You all all right? What's the matter? Bit quiet today. l left me brain at home, didn't l? - Seemed like the most sensible thing to do. - Oh, yeah? Why's that? This is suicide, Bex. lt was bad enough last time when we was mob-handed. 'Ere, there ain't even 30 of us. lt's fucking stupid, that's all. - Oh, what, l'm daft, now, am l? - No, l'm not saying that. No? No, you're not, are you? - Sounds like it to me. - l'm not saying that. - Bex, leave it out. - Who are you talking to? - He's just a... Look, just leave... - What? What are you stuttering for? Eh? - l was just saying. - Don't just fucking say nothing. Don't talk to me like that in front of mates. - l didn't... - What you tryin' to do? - Make me look like a fucking Toby? - l didn't say nothing. Don't interrupt me either, when l'm talking to ya. Listen to me! Let me say something to ya. You fucking drove me mad to get involved with us. Followed me about like a little dog. Even went and bought the same pair of trainers as me. No, l know about that turn-out. Do you lot know? This little no-good cunt went and bought the same pair of trotters as me. Even made out like he'd had 'em for ages. What, and now you want to have it on your toes, do ya? Cos your bottle's gone and you think it's on us? - Mm! - Nah. Nah, it don't work like that. See, you ain't like Snowy and that mob. They live miles off the plot. They can run and hide and keep their nuts down. But you? You live on the fucking manor. You'll have to bump into me every day. And l can't stand seeing people that let me down, it fucking drives me mad. So you're in, champ. Right to the fucking end. All right? - All right? - All right. Yeah, good. Good. That's fucking playground behaviour, that, innit? Someone ought to report me to the headmaster. What are you smiling for? What you fucking smiling for? Stand up, all of ya. We got run last week. Well, it ain't gonna fucking happen this week. Eh? The pub ain't open, so you ain't gettin' laggin'. Oi, oi, Trigger! Come on. All right, Bex. - You all 'ere? - All ready, mate? Come on. Let's go. All right? No shoutin' when we get round here, Trig. Tell this little mob. All right, shh. Shut up, all of ya. Don't want this mob to know we're coming. All right, mate? - You up for today? - Hey, Yeti! Yeti, l swear l've just seen Bex get out of his motor round the corner. Look, he ain't gonna have the front to turn up here after last week, is he? - How many handed? - Firm-handed, mate. Hold up. He reckons Bex has just got out of a motor... - They're 'ere! - Come on, Yeti! - Oi, oi, oi! - Come on, Yeti! Where are you now, eh? Come on. Come on, then, Bex, you fucking cunt. Right! Steam through these fucking shitholes! Yeah, you shit cunt! Bexy. Not you again. Oh, no. Most of us survive it unscathed. But an increasing number of young people are... You not hungry, babe? Do you want to talk about it? Cos you know you can, don't you? l know what it is. He's knocking about with them older boys, - and they've spun his nut. - You spin my nut. Ngggh. ls it a bird? - ls it a plane? - Oh, shut up, you, fatso. Did she break your heart? Cos it happens to us all, you know, some time in our lives. All l can tell you is, it's what makes a man a man, if you know what l mean. Come on, then, dinlow. l wouldn't start giving it the big 'un if l was you. You look like a fucking postbox in that tracksuit. Where we goin', anyway? Get some puff. You got any? Course l ain't. Makes a change. Let's go round and see me dad. See if we can ponce some money. Make out you've been mugged. Why do l always have to be mugged? Cos he believes you. Why me? l dunno. Cos you're ginger, and he feels sorry for ya. Whatever, Jils. Who you callin' a Jils? You, you fuckin' strawberry Miwi. Don't start gettin' tricky, helmet. Don't you start gettin' tricky, then. Helmet.
