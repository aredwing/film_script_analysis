Oh, I Love A Fireside  When A Storm Is Due  I Like Potato Chips  Moonlight And Motor Trips  How About You?  [ Sigh ] I'm Mad About Good Books  Can't Get My Fill  And Mr. Kennedy's Looks  Give Me A Thrill  Holding Hands In The Movie Show  When All The Lights Are Low  May Not Be New  But I Like It  How About You?  I Like New Jersey In June  How About You?  And I Love Me A Bernstein Tune  How About You?  I Love A Tv Set  When A Storm Is Due  You Know, I Like My Fish 'n' Chips  Rock 'n' Roll And Filter Tips  How About You?  I'm Nuts About Good Cooks  Can Never Get My Fill  And Mrs. Darin's Looks  Kind Of Give Me A Thrill  Holding Hands In The Movie Show  All The Way In The Last Row  May Not Be New  But I Like It, How About You?  [ ] [ Rattling ] Donkeys On The Lawn. Shit! That's It! I Don't Want To Go. They're Trying To Get Rid Of Us Before They Arrived. Woman: A Few Of The Residents Are Just Leaving On A Day Excursion But, Um, Come On Through To The Sitting Room. We'll Get You Comfortable, And I Can Explain All About Life Here At Woodlane. I'm Not Going. I Am Not Going. Actually, She's Just Trying To Get Rid Of Us. Heather, Hazel... She's Just Trying To Get Rid Of Us. Let Me Tell You Something About This Bloody Place. Are You Looking Forward To Your Day Out? No! I'm Not Going, And You Can't Make Me. We're Not Going, Anyway. If She's Not Going, I'm Not Going. Do Those Two Hags Never Stop Whining? Shall We All Come Through To The Fire, And Settle Down, Yes? By The Way, Someone Went Into My Room And Left The Toilet Seat Up While I Was At Breakfast. Woman: Hazel, Why Would Anyone Do Anything Like That? So That People Would Think I Had Men In. Man: [ Giggling ] Men In Your Room. That'll Be The Day. Heather, Wait For Me! They Practically Ran Out Of The Place. Man: [ On Speaker Phone ] Oh No! You'll Have To Advertise Again. You Do Realise That In The Last Six Months, You've Lost Two Nurses, Six Carers, And Three Residents Because Those Four Obnoxious Old... Two Residents. Mrs. Holland Died Of A Massive Heart Attack. Yeah, Well I'm Sure They Caused It. Look, As Your Accountant, I've Said It Before And I'll Say It Again, Get Rid Of Them. Got To Call You Back. What's All This? Well How About, "Hi, Ellie, How's It Going?" You Should Have Rung. What... Woman: It Cost A Fortune To Send You To College. Now You Want To Work As A Skivvy? A Hygiene Technician. And It's Temporary. It Won't Work. It Never Works. I Haven't Seen You For What... A Year? And After 10 Minutes, I Don't Think I Want To See You For Another Year. Oh, Come On, Kate. It Looks Like You Could Do With Some Help. I Heard The Staff Are Leaving Here Quicker Than The Residents. Mum Told Me. So, You Two Are Speaking Again, Then? Well, Not Really. I Ring Home, She Talks About You, Or Herself. Mostly About You. I Don't Figure Largely In The Conversations. It Would Be Good For Both Of Us. Ellie, You're Not Doing This For Me. So What's Really Going On? Some Friends Are Planning This Round The World Trip, And I Really Want To Go With Them, Kate. How Many Times Are You Going To Go Around The World? Look, I Figured If You Just Paid Me In Cash... I Suppose You Want To Live Here As Well? Well, You've Plenty Of Room. I Gave Up My Flat So I Wouldn't Have To Waste Money On Rent. It's The Only Way I'd Have Enough Money To Go With Them And I'm Trying To Get Dan To Go With Me, Too. You're Not Still Going Out With Him, Are You? Two Years Now, Thank You Very Much. I Just Don't Know What You See In Him. He Always Seems So Bloody Miserable. Not When He's With Me, He's Not. So, What Do You Say? Why Can't I Stay At Your House? If You Want To Work Here, You Have To Stay In Staff Accommodation. Ugh... Jesus, It's Freezing In Here! [ Grunt ] You Don't Seriously Expect Me To Wear This? Mum Was Right. His Eyes Are Too Close Together. She Said The Same About David. You May As Well Start Straight Away. Ten Minutes, Downstairs. Oh, And Ellie? Do Something With Your Hair! [ Vacuum Whirring ] Woman: [ Shouting ] Get Out Of My Home! Get Out! Get Out! You Come Into My Room, You Move Everything, And I Can't Find It. And I Know You're Stealing From Me. Why Don't You Go Back To Asia, Where You Belong? I Am Spanish, Georgia. [ Stammering ] Who Cares? You're All The Same. Do You Even Have A Visa To Get Into This Country? I Don't Need A Visa To Work. I Am European. You're A What? You're A... You're A Pain In The Ass! I Can't Go Out With One Earring. Get Back In My Room And Find My Earring! But I Cannot Find It. Maybe Ellie Could Find It? [ Vacuum Whirring ] [ Door Slam ] [ Object Clinking ] [ Rain Pattering ] Hello. Hello. Shame About The Weather. Yes, Isn't It? I'd Like To Go Down By The River. But They Say I'll Catch My Death. [ Laughing ] What's So Funny? I'm Dying Anyway. A Little Trip To The River Won't Make The Slightest Difference. Never Think He Was Once A Judge Of The High Court, Would You? Quite Brilliant In His Day, Apparently. You Don't Look Like Someone Who'd Work In A Place Like This. You Don't Look Like Someone Who'd Stay In A Place Like This. Well, I Never Thought I'd End Up In One. I'm Alice. I'm Ellie. It's Very Nice To Meet You. Well, Ellie, If You Don't Mind, I'd Like To Continue Taking In The View. I'll Clean Up In Here Later. [ ] What Is It? I'm In The Middle Of A Game Of Pool. Would You Let Hazel Know, There's A Registered Letter Here For Her? How Many Times Have I Got To Tell You That Hazel Does Not Want To Be Bothered With Stuff Like This? The Post Goes To Me! [ Horn Honking ] [ Blow-Dryer Whirring ] [ Piano ] [ Rumble Of Car Engine Approaching ] [ Loud Car Stereo ] Woman: Ah, We're Awake, Are We? Now, How Are We Feeling Today? No Need To Shout. I May Be Dying, But I'm Not Deaf. Ellie? Uh, You'd Stay And Give Me My Breakfast, Don't You? Of Course. Well, Thank You, Nurse. Oh, Wow! You Look Really Beautiful. Where Was This Taken? Morocco. A Long Time Ago. I Remember Very Well, Lying On A Beach Outside Casablanca. Smoking Hashish. Not The Sort Of Behaviour Expected Of A Young Lady In Those Days, Believe Me. I Can Get You Some, If You Like. Well, At This Stage I'd Try Anything. We Were There One Christmas... It Was Just Right, You Know? Sunny And Warm. A Holiday Relaxes A Man. He Was Very Handsome. He Was. Unfortunately, We Were Never Blessed With Children, And I Regret That. But We Travelled A Lot. I've Led A Charmed Life, Ellie. Is He Still Alive? Only In Here. Oh, I'm Sorry. Don't Be. We Had A Great Time Together. And I'm Kind Of Hoping... That I'll See Him Again Someday. [ ] [ Knocking ] Hey? Ellie, Waking Everyone Up In The Middle Of The Night Is Not On. Sorry! Nurse Has Been Complaining About You Again. Said She Had To Serve Breakfast By Herself This Morning. Where Were You? I Was With Alice, She Needed To Talk. I'm Not Paying You To Sit Around Chatting. Anything Else? No. God, You're So Uptight All The Time. Jeez! When Was The Last Time You Took A Holiday? All That Money You Got When David Died. What About It? Why Don't You Spend Some Of It? How Do You Think I Bought This Place? Always Poking Your Nose Into Things That Don't Concern You, Aren't You? We're Going To End Up Like Them If We're Not Careful. Yeah. They Spent Their Whole Lives Looking After Their Invalid Mother. And Then When She Died, They Didn't Know What To Do With Themselves. So They Moved In Here? Mm-Hmm. [ ] Dietrich: [ On Tv ] I Never Faint Because I'm Not Sure That I Would Fall Gracefully And I Never Use Smelling Salts... [ Imitating Dietrich ] I Never Use Smelling Salts, Because Zey Puff Up Ze Eyes. [ Laughing ] [ Knock On Door ] Yes? Yes? I Found Your Earring. Oh, You Are An Angel. [ ] Georgia Summers? That Was Your Stage Name. Very Glamorous. I Suppose "Platt" Isn't Very... Darling, Could You Make Me A Martini? That's What I Need. I Didn't Know You Were Allowed Alcohol. We're Not Prisoners. We Actually Pay To Be Here, Bizarrely Enough. Whisper Of Dry Vermouth. Shake And Pour, And Don't Forget The Olive. Are You Out Of Your Mind? What? I Could Be Arrested For This. Would You Relax? It's A Tiny Bit Of Grass, And It's For Alice. Oh, Oh! It's For Alice. Oh, Silly Me. Oh, That's Okay, So... What... What Are You Doing? You Do This Again And You're Out, Do You Hear? And If You've Any More Drugs, Get Rid Of Them. You Just Don't Think, Do You? You Know, If You Want To Mess Up Your Own Life, That's Fine. Just Don't Try And Drag Me Down With You. Yeah, You Don't Need My Help For That. Oh, You Always Have The Smart Answer, Don't You? It Helps Her With Her Pain. She's Dying, Kate. I Was Trying To Help Her. You're Trying To Get Me Closed Down, You Mean. This Is My Premises, I'll Be Held Responsible. These Are Going Down The Toilet. Oh, You And Your Fucking Rules! Huh... [ Piano ] [ ] Yes. Was That Absolutely Necessary? Oh, Tactics, My Darling, As Our Donald Would Say. Tactics. Mammy Always Said You Were Too Competitive. [ Quiet Cackle ] [ Grunt ] [ Balls Clattering ] Oops-A-Daisy. Who's Having Tea? [ Growling ] Hazel: Two Shots To Me. Oh No, Ellie! You Totally Distracted Me. I Was Just About To Pot The Ball. Did You Not Think... God Almighty! What Are You Laughing At? You Stupid Woman! God! [ Screaming ] Jesus Christ, What's Happened To You? Jesus, Mary And Joseph. Hazel, Let Me See Your Eyes! Please! Please, Let Me See If You're Blinded! Oh, Thank God! There's No Blood, Darling. Kate: What Were You Thinking? Ellie: It Was An Accident. Look, I Wasn't Even Aiming For Hazel, I Was Aiming For Heather. Well, I Warned You. So You Can Pack Your Bags And Leave. Oh, Come On, Kate. Look, What Am I Supposed To Do When I'm Attacked? Attacked? By A Woman Twice Your Age In A Residential Home? You Let Them Get Away With Murder. I've A Business To Run. Yeah. Well, If You Ask Me, You're Running It Into The Ground. Well, I Didn't Ask You, And You're Not Making My Life Any Easier. I Have A Department Of Health Inspector Due Here Soon. It'll Be Just Great If Hazel Tells Them What Happened To Her Eye. Staff Attacking Residents? It Was Hardly An Attack. She Didn't Even Need That Fucking Eye Patch. I Don't Need Any More Trouble. So... Where Will You Go? Look, I'm Really Sorry. I Didn't Mean It. Would You Give Me One More Chance, Please? Please. [ Mixed Whispers ] Various: Go On. Get It. Get The Remote Control. He's Asleep. [ Growl ] [ Gasping ] [ ] You'll Be Able To Munch Through Acres Of Grass With Those New Gnashers, Mary. [ Chuckling ] [ Sobbing ] That Was A Horrible Thing To Say. Horrible, But True! Bloody Dentist! I'd Like To Gnash His Gnashers. I'll Have Tea. A Little Milk, No Sugar. Get It Yourself. I Said, No Sugar And A Little Milk. [ Sigh ] [ Cup Rattling ] [ Tv Chatter ] [ ] [ Knocking On Door ] [ ] [ Gasp ] God. Jeez. What Are You Doing In Here? Your Nerves Are In A Bad Way. You Shouldn't Be In Here, And You Certainly Shouldn't Be Smoking. Your Concern For My Health Is So Touching. [ ] Hot Date, Have We? [ Chortle ] I Suppose "Honk-Honk" Is Zooming Up Late As Usual. We're Supposed To Keep IThem/I Waiting, Not The Other Way 'round. [ ] Honk-Honk. [ ] Ellie: [ Distant ] Hello! Dan? Can You Hear Me? Shit! [ Knocking ] [ Muffled ] Do You Want To Come In? Shit... Is He Always Late? He's Just Been Working Really Hard Lately. [ Cellphone Chiming ] [ Sigh ] He's Not Coming, Is He? No, He's Busy. Well, Do You Want To See A Film? We Could Get A Pizza... No, I Don't. It's Saturday Night, I Want To Go Out. Look, Why Don't We Go? [ Laugh ] Are You Mad? Kate, It's Been Five Years Now Since David Died. How Do You Expect To Meet Anyone If You Don't Get Out There? Ellie: When Did Donald's Wife Die? Um... Couple Of Years Ago. I Bet He Never Acted The Arsehole When She Was Around. Why? I Was Just Wondering. It's Funny How Differently People Respond To Loss. What Did She Die Of? Cancer. Same As David. He Doesn't Like To Talk About It. I Wonder What's Worse... Dying, Or Being The One Watching, Not Being Able To Do Anything. Either Way, It's Shite, Ellie. Fuck It. I'm Going To Go And Surprise Him. Some Men Don't Like To Be Surprised. He's Not Like That. He'll Love It! Close The Bloody Door. [ ] [ Sniffling ] [ ] [ Steps Creaking ] Man: As You Know, The Department Needs To Ensure Regulations Are Met. Kate: Yes, I'll See What I Can Get Done With That Application In The Meantime. And, Uh, I Need It On My Desk A.S.A.P. Yes, Thank You Very Much, Mr. Evans. Elle, Are You All Right? You Look A Bit... Yeah, I'm Fine. How Was Dan? Great. So, He Didn't Mind Being Surprised, Then? No. Why Should He? Who Was That? Mmm. Department Of Health. Mr. Evans. He Likes Dropping In Unannounced Every So Often, To See If He'll Catch Us Torturing The Residents. Oh! Look, Missed A Bit. [ Sigh ] Hi, Alice. I Have Something For You. What's Wrong, Ellie? You Look Tired. [ Sniffle ] Take Me Down To The River. The Nurse'll Have A Fit. Screw Nurse. Quick! Quick! Yes! Shh, Shh... [ Giggling ] [ ] Alice: [ Giggling ] Ellie, Just Because You Split Up With Your Boyfriend Doesn't Mean You Can't Go. Don't Be One Of Those Women Who Thinks They Can Only Do Things If They Have A Man At Their Side. What Does Your Sister Say? I Didn't Tell Her. She'd Just Say, "I Told You So". Oh, Ellie. You Need To Pay More Attention To What People IDo./I Not To What They Say, Or How They Seem. It's What They Do That Tells You About Them. She Gave You A Job, Didn't She? And A Place To Live. Ugh. [ ] Maybe I Should Have Thought Of This Earlier. [ Chuckling ] Or Maybe It's Just As Well. [ ] You Only See Things Properly When You're About To Leave. Then It's As If You're Seeing For The First Time. Everything Seems To Shine! [ ] [ Car Doors Opening/Closing ] [ ] [ Gasp ] Open A Window And Let Some Air In. [ ] [ Sniffling ] Various: Bye-Bye. Merry Christmas. See You At New Year! Merry Christmas! [ Stoned Chuckle ] Woman: Would You Like Some Tea, Or Some Cookies? Ellie: I Thought You Said "Cocaine". Do All The Residents Leave? A Few Will Stay, The Horrible Ones. And Poor Kate, She Stay Here To Mind Them. I Would Rather Spend Christmas With The Devil Than With Them. How About You? Um... No, I've Got To Leave. I'll Stay With Some Friends For A Few Days, And Then... Who Knows? How About You? Uh, I Go Back To Spain, To My Family. Nurse: [ Giggling ] [ ] [ Giggling ] Goodbye. [ ] You Still Play? [ Piano Notes ] Um, Yeah, Sometimes. I Haven't Played For Ages. Ellie, Mum's Had A Stroke. She's In Hospital. Is She Okay? Yeah, She's Fine, She's Stable. Why Didn't You Tell Me? I Only Found Out A While Ago. Look, I've Spent The Last Hour Trying To Relocate Donald And Georgia And The Nightingales Into Santa Rosa. All The Other Homes Are Either Full Or Closed For Christmas. And, Frankly Even If I Do Find Somewhere For Donald And The Nightingales, No One'll Take Georgia. She's Actually Barred From Santa Rosa. Did You Know That? Why Can't They Stay Here And Nurse Healy Look After Them? Kate: I Can't Ask Her. She's Going On A Cruise. I've Never Seen Her So Excited. You'll Have To Stay And Mind Them. Me? Look After Them? Look, We've No Choice. You Know You Don't Get On With Mum. There's No Point In You Going. Look, Let Me Go. I Won't Say Anything To Upset Her. You Don't Have To Say Anything. Look, I Really Need This, Ellie. It's The Only Way It'll Work. Keep An Eye On Georgia, She's Manic-Depressive. Keep Her Away From The River. I'm Always Afraid She'll Fall In And Drown, Or Jump. Afraid Or Hoping? Very Funny. Um... Keep This On You At All Times In Case I Need To Contact You. All Right? [ Sigh ] God, Ellie, This Is Insane! I Could Be Shut Down For This. If That Little Shit, Mr. Evans, Comes Snooping Around... We've Just Had An Inspection. He Won't Be Back For Months. That's Not How Mr. Evans Works. Anyway... I'll Send A Temp As Fast As I Can. Worst Case Scenario, The Staff Will Be Back On The 28Th. That's A Week Away. I Said, "Worst Case". I Just Can't Afford To Lose Any More Residents, Ellie. You Really Need To Be... Look, I'll Be Nice To Them, Look, I Promise. Will You Call Me When You Get There? All Right, Okay. [ Sigh ] Hi. Hi. Here You Go. And A Miss Nightingale, Hazel? Yeah. Sign There, Please. [ Footsteps ] No, I Had A Very, Very Bad Experience With Mushrooms. Now, Miss Harris Knows That. Where Is She? Our Mother Isn't Very Well. So, Kate Has Gone To Look After Her. Well, If Miss Harris Is Not Here, Who Is? Well, Only Me, I'm Afraid. I Think She Means: "Anyone Of Any Consequence". Well, How Long Is Miss Harris Going To Be Away For? Well, It Could Be Until After Christmas Now, I Don't Know. Oh, No This Is Not Good Enough. No. We Pay Good Money To Be Here And We Don't Need To Put Up With This. [ Chuckling ] Well, Where Would You Two Raconteurs Go To? That Is, If You Can Get Your Sister To Go Out Of The Front Door. [ Chuckle ] Santa Della Maria Della Rosa, Actually. Oh, Please, Go! And Regale Them All With Stories Of Your Fabulous Love Lives And Your Careers. Ellie: Santa Rosa Della Maria Is Closed For Christmas Now. And... Georgia Is Banned From Santa Rosa, Anyway, So She Can't Go Anywhere. So, It Looks Like We're Just Stuck With Each Other. It Seems The Only Way To Leave Here Is In A Box. What About Me Soup? Ellie: You Can Have Chicken Noodle, Classic Vegetable, Carrot And Coriander Soup, Potato And Leek Soup, Pea Soup, If You Like. You Could Have Mutton Broth, Or You Can Have Lobster Bisque. Oxtail Soup, Mmm! Or You Can Have French Onion Soup. It All Comes Out Of A Tin, So It Makes No Difference To Me. What Would You Like? [ ] [ Electronic Beep ] [ ] [ Telephone Ringing ] [ ] Georgia? Hello? Man: [ On Tv ] I Expect You've Got An Ailment And I've Got The Cure. We'll Beat The Loath From Your Body And Every Morning You Come Here To Work... [ Spraying ] Georgia, What's Wrong? There's A Bluebottle Buzzing. What? A Bluebottle, Buzzing! Can't You Hear It? Th-That's The Fridge. The Fridge. As You're Here... Might As Well Get Me A Martini. Two Measures Of Gin. Four Measures Of Vermouth. Lot Of Ice. Shake It. And Get Me Some Olives, I've Run Out. The House Phone Is For Emergencies, Not Bloody Room Service. You Bloody Well Watch Your Language Or I'll Bloody Well Get You Sacked. Ellie! [ Door Slam ] Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Georgia: Ah, Now... Two Jigs Of Gin, Four Jigs Of Dry Vermouth. Plenty Of Ice. Shake It Well. Thank You, Dear. That's So Sweet Of You. [ Telephone Ringing ] Donald, You Okay? Donald: [ On Phone ] One Soft-Boiled Egg, Two Slices Of Toast With Butter And And Marmalade On The Side. Donald, It's 5:30 In The Morning. I'm Well Aware Of The Time. Breakfast Is At 8:00. I Have It In My Room, Every Day At [ Disconnection Beep ] [ Frustrated Groan ] [ Door Opening ] [ ] I Like My Toast Cut Into Soldiers. You'd Never Think She Had Two Hip Replacements. Didn't Have Two Hip Replacements. She Had One Hip Replacement And Then She Broke Her Leg. Tsk. At Her Age You'd Think She'd Be More Careful. Especially On Wet Grass. She'd Do Anything For Attention. I Love To Window Shop  On Fifth Avenue  I Like Banana Splits  Late Supper At The Ritz  How About You?  Whee! Here, You Must Be Freezing. Georgia: [ Drunken Singing ] Whoop! I Remember Feeling Like That Once. But I Was On Drugs. Hazel: Mozart! Heather: Strauss! Hazel: Mozart! Heather: Strauss! Mozart Wrote "Die Fledermaus". What Mouse? "Die Fledermaus" By Mozart. Strauss! Mozart! Strauss! Sorry? "Die Fledermaus", It's An Opera By Strauss. Hah! I Don't Know Anything About Opera. Well, Neither Do These Two Bats, But It Doesn't Stop Them Talking About It. Bats! "Die Fledermaus"! No, Georgia, I Don't Have Time To Get Your Olives. Georgia: [ On Phone ] Oh, You Stupid Girl, Stupid... [ Clatter ] Oh, Shit! God, Not Even When I'm 90. [ ] Huh. [ ] What The Hell Are You Doing Here? I'm... I'm So... You Have No Right To Be In Here. Okay, I'm Sorry... No Right Whatsoever! Get Out! [ ] Run! Run! Run! Yes, Yes, Yes. [ Knock On Door ] [ Muttering Scores ] How Could You? What Are You Talking About? He's Been Trying To Find Me, And You Knew. Turn That Fucking Thing Off! What's The Matter With You? This. This Is The Matter. "Dear Miss Nightingale, Thank You For Your Letter. We Passed It On To Simon As You Instructed. He's Very Disappointed That You Don't Want To Meet Him But He Understands." Oh, Come On, Hazel. You Wrote, Pretending You Were Me. My Son Has Been Trying To Find Me And You Weren't Going To Tell Me. Well, I Just Didn't Think It Was Worth Dragging All This Stuff Up... How Long Have You Known About This? Well... You Didn't Think I'd Want To Meet My Son? I Always Said That If He Ever Looked For Me, I Would Welcome Him With Open Arms, And You Knew That. He's My Son, For God's Sake. He's Not Your Son, Hazel. You Gave Him Up But I Didn't Give Him Up, Did I? He Was Taken From Me. He Was Taken From Me, Heather. Because That Father Of Ours Was More Concerned About What People Would Think Than He Was For Me. Ah, Daddy Was Only Trying To Do The Best For You, Hazel, And For The Family. He Ruined My Life And Yours And Mammy's. No Wonder She Got Sick. And We Sat There Like Fools And Took It. You Have No Idea. You Have No Idea At All... What It's Like To Have A Part Of You Taken Away Like That. Not A Day Passes That I Don't Think Of Him. Not A Day Goes By When I Don't Worry About What Happened To Him. I Have Never Stopped Thinking Of Him, And Wondering... And I Didn't Even Know His Name. [ ] Donald: [ Humming ] Brump Bom-Bom-Bom  Bom-Bom-Bom Bom-Bom  Brump Bom-Bom Brump Bom-Bom  Brump Bom-Bom-Bom! Bom-Bom Bom-Bom  [ Clears Throat ] You Recognise It? [ Sniffle ] Yeah. Thought You Wouldn't. "Die Fledermaus", Act One. Will You Ever Go And Fuck Yourself, Donald? [ Humming ] Now, Hazel Won't Be Down For Her Food Tonight. She's Not Feeling The Best. Oh, Something Fatal, I Hope? And Did Miss Harris Not Tell You That You Never, Ever, Give The Post To Hazel? You Give It To Me. You've Upset Her. Okay, I'm Sorry... Oh, You've Upset Her. Oh, Very Parsimonious With The Vegetables, Aren't We, Eleanor? Have Either Of You Seen Georgia Anywhere? I Said, "Very Parsimonious With The Vegeta..." I Heard You. Ugh... [ Growl ] Oops. You... You Bastard! [ Crash ] Oh! Ooh. [ Muttering ] Georgia's Missing. Donald: Thank God For That. Look, I-I Want My Dessert And I'd Like It Now. Preferably On My Plate, Not On My Lap, If It's Not Too Much To Ask. [ Chortle ] She's Not Too Good With A Moving Target. Jesus Christ! Oh, Oh. She Said To Add It To Her Bill. [ Telephone Ringing ] With Any Luck, That'll Be The Police. Hello, Woodlane. Kate: [ On Phone ] Elle, It's Me. Kate! Um... Is Everything Okay? Yeah, Everything's Fine. Um... Ellie, What's Going On? Look, I'm... I'm Just In The Middle Of Something Right Now. Can I Call You Back Later? Ellie, Tell Me Now! Georgia... Donald: Why Don't You Try The Pub? Sneaky Bitch! [ Hinges Creaking ] [ Engine Ignition ] [ Muted Singing ] Patrons: And Frank Sinatra's Looks  Gives Me A Thrill  Holding Hands In The Movie Show  When All The Lights Are Low  May Not Be New  But I Like It, How About You?  I Like Jack Benny's Jokes  [ Softly ] Whiskey. To A Degree  I Like The Common Folks  That Includes Me  I Love To Window Shop On Fifth Avenue  I Like Banana Splits  Late Supper At The Ritz  How About You?  I'm Mad About Good Books  Can't Hear You! And Frank Sinatra's Looks  Give Me A Thrill  Holding Hands In The Movie Show  When All The Lights Are Low  May Not Be New  But I Like It  II Like It/I  I Like It  II Like It/I  I Like It, How About You?  [ Applause ] Oh, There You Are, Darling. Is My Car Ready? Yes, Whenever You Are, Miss Summers. Ah... Thank You. Lovely, Lovely. Thank You. Lovely. Off We Go. [ ] That Was Fun. That Was Fun! Oh, I Miss It. I Miss Being Young, I... I Miss The Singing And The Dancing And The Orchestra. I Passed Three Auditions And I Got Into The Chorus Of The Kit Kat Klub In "Cabaret". Oh, No. I've Told You That. And Before That, I Was In "The Sound Of Music". Or, Did I Tell You That? No. No, You Didn't. Mmm, It Was Long Ago. Long Before You Were Born. Oh, I Miss Being Young, I Miss It. Oh God, I Miss That Life. Now Look At Me. Locked Up In That Nuthouse With A Bloody Stick. You Still Look Good, Though. I Mean, You Don't Look Old. You Don't Look Bad... Oh, Piss Off, Ellie. Oh, No, Sorry, I Didn't Mean... I Know What You Meant. You See, Everything Was Different. Me And My Friends, We All Wanted To Look Like Twiggy. "Look Like Twiggy". None Of These Goldfish Lips And Balloon Boobs. I Hated Living Alone. That's Why I Ended Up Here. But All You Do Is Abuse Everybody. Guess That's Part Of The Fun. So, Why Here, Georgia? Well, My Husband Was Irish, So We Lived Here. We Had A Lot Of Laughs. Very Happy, And Then He Went And Died On Me. So, I Got The Stupid Idea I'd Go Back Into The Theatre. Everything Was Changed. All The People I Knew Had Either Died Or... [ Yawn ] Or Just Didn't Care. Mmm. I Felt Like A Ghost. Wandering Around. No Connections Here. Nothing To Go Back To. [ Chuckling ] Ah... Oh, Dear... Don't Forget The Olives. [ Piano ] [ Telephone Ringing ] I Know. One Soft-Boiled Egg, Two Pieces Of Toast, Butter And And Marmalade On The Side. What Was That Piece Of Music That You Played Last Night? You Forgot The Salt. Donald, Would You Give Me A Break? Look, I Can't Eat My Egg Without Salt. Right! You Can Have As Much Salt As You Like With Your Breakfast At 8:00 O'clock With The Others. Now, Wait A Minute. Eleanor! Ellie: Well, I Was Thinking Of Burning The Place Down, With Them In It. That Would Solve All Your Problems. You Are Insured, Aren't You? Kate: [ On Phone ] Don't Even Joke About It. Listen, Ellie... I Don't Think I'm Going To Get Home For Christmas. I Hate Christmas. Dear Santa  Don't Come To My House  Whoa-Oh  Santa, Please Stay Away  I Don't Like  Those Elves Or Your Reindeer  That Pipe  Or Your Big, Ugly Sleigh  So, Santa  Don't Come To My House  No, No  I've Not Been A Good Boy  'cause I Don't Like Your Laugh  Or Your Boots Or Your Beard  And I Don't Think You're Jolly  Just Creepy And Weird  What's All This About An Announcement? I Was Thinking We Should Have Christmas Dinner Together. Look, We're All Going To Be Here For Christmas, And There's Nothing We Can Do About It, So, We Might As Well Try And Be A Family. We May Be A Dysfunctional Family, But We're Still A Family, Nonetheless. I'd Rather Be Dead Than Related To Any Of Them. So, Is That The Announcement? I'm Going To Have My Christmas Lunch In My Room. Please Make Sure It's Hot. I'll Have Mine In My Room, You Can Leave It Outside My Door. [ Slam ] I'm Not Going To Take Any More Shit From Any Of You. If You Want Your Lunch, You Can Eat It Down Here, Or Else Starve. Is There A Full Moon Or Something? Oh, Look At You. You've Made A Mess Of Your Whole Life. And Here You Are, Old, Bitter And Hateful. And All You Do, All Day, Is Sit Around, Bitching And Moaning And Complaining. Wash This! Bring Me That! I Don't Eat This! I Don't Eat That! Bees Buzzing Around, And Olives, And Your Fucking Post. Yeah, And You. You're Probably Going To End Up Leaving In A Box, And The Sooner The Better, As Far As I'm Concerned. Look, I Can Be A Spoiled Bitch Too. [ Smashing ] [ Yelps ] Well, Come On! Let's Smash The Place Up. Heather: [ Shrieking ] It's Going To Close Anyway. C-Control Yourself, Girl. Ellie: Why Should I? You Bloody Don't. I... [ Stammering ] Just Because You Pay To Be Here, Doesn't Give You The Right To Treat Me Like Shit! Do You Know Between The Four Of You, You've Almost Bankrupted Woodlane? Nonsense! Just Think About All The People That Have Moved Out Because Of You. All The Empty Rooms Upstairs. How The Hell Do You Think Kate Pays The Bills? Heather: Don't Be Ridiculous. W-W-Woodlane Can't Close Down. Yes, Heather, It Can. And By The Way That You Behave, Nobody's Going To Take You In For Long. You'll End Up Out On The Street Or In A Mental Institution With Mad People Screaming And The Smell Of Piss Everywhere. And As For You Two, You Don't Even Need To Be Here. You're Not Even Fucking Old. You've Checked Out Of Life And You've Checked Into Here. All Of You! [ ] [ Knocking On Door ] Heather: Hazel... Let Me In? [ Lock Clicking ] Go Away! [ ] [ Dish Clinking ] Ellie: Thanks. Uh, "Gnossienne Number 4" By Erik Satie. I Used To Play It... For My Wife. The Lady In The Picture? She Was Very Beautiful. It Was Sarah's Favourite Piece. And When I Play It, I Feel Very Close To Her. One Moment, She Was There. Next Minute, She Had Gone. It Just Didn't Make Sense. [ Voice Breaking ] Might Have Been Easier To Accept If... I'd Managed To Sober Up Before She Died. I Mean, That Was The Very Least I Could Have Done For Her. But I Didn't. I Wish I Had. [ ] [ Sigh ] [ Chair Scraping ] [ Clinking ] [ Rain Pattering ] Ellie: [ Clears Throat ] The Committee... The Committee Said That We Might Be Able To Help You. Can You Let Her Finish Just One Sentence? Just Once. Who Asked You, Has-Been? Georgia: Well, At Least I Was Something. What Did You Ever Do? Nothing. You're Useless. [ Chuckling ] Like Tits On A Bull. Heather: Ugh! Donald! The Committee Decided We Might Help Make Christmas Dinner Tomorrow. And We Made A List Of What We Need. We Should All Go And Do The Shopping. Oh, Shopping! That's A Good Idea. I'll Stay Here And... No, Hazel... Mind The House. Heather: No, Please. I Don't Want You To Be On Your Own. I Don't Want To Go. Look, We All Go Or Nobody Goes. Merry Christmas To You. [ Chuckle ] Merry Christmas To You. Merry Christmas To You... I Told You, I'm Not Going. She's Afraid To Go Out. But I See Her In The Gardens All The Time. But Not Out-Out. Well, Tough. You're Going. Come On, We Can Have A Little Talk. I Don't Want A Little Talk. All Right. All Right. I Hate Going Out. I'll Be Out In The Garden If You Change Your Mind. [ Whimper ] [ Engine Ignition ] Carolers: The World In Sin And Error Pining  Till He Appeared  And The Soul Felt His Worth  A Thrill Of Hope, The Weary World Rejoices  We'll Take That One. What? Donald's Getting The Vegetables. Um, What Else Do We Need? Ham. We Have The Ham. We Have The Sprouts... Wh... Where's Georgia? Oh, Okay, Um, Look... Here, Take This. Take This. You're Going To Have To Finish The Shopping. Just... Look, Um, Uh, Look, Okay... I'm Going To Meet You In There In An Hour From Now, Okay? I'm Not Going In There. Yes, It's... You'll Be Fine. Hey, Come Here. Come Here, Take That. Just Take That. I'll Meet You In The Bar, Okay? All Right. Georgia? Georgia? Lovely Boys. [ Clock Ticking ] [ Quiet Chatter ] [ Door Opening ] There You Are. Now, What'll You Have, Ladies? I'll Have Some Of What She's Having. What's That? It's A Kind Of Fancy Orange. A Kind Of Fancy Orange? Two Of Those, Please. Two Of Those Things... And, Uh, For Me, A Coffee With Just A Little Milk And No Sugar. Excuse Me? Okay? Huh. Good, Huh? Georgia, You're Going To Get Us Chucked Out Of Here. You're Not Supposed To Smoke. Darling, We've Had This Discussion. [ Sigh ] Have You Seen The Paintings? Hmm? What? Donald: Huh! Hazel Did These. Good Lord! Well Done, My Dear. [ Mumbling ] Well Done. [ Glasses Clinking ] Cheers. Donald, You Should Have One Of These. [ Chuckling ] Trouble Is, Once I Start, I Can't Stop. I Drank My Way Through Two Family Fortunes. One Day, I Was Sitting In My Chambers, And Three Of My Colleagues Came In, And Suggested That I Retire. I Thought... I've Got A Few Years To Go Yet. But, No... They Insisted I Retire That Afternoon. And I Hope Nobody Knew. Hey, Lady? [ Yelp ] You're On. [ Mixed Chatter ] Hazel: Every Now And Then When My Room Would Get Too Full, Heather Would Bring Them Down To A Dealer In Town And He'd... He'd Sell Them. I Had A Boyfriend Once. He Was A Painter, Too. We Were Going To Set Up A Studio Together But... My Father Didn't Approve. He Didn't Consider It A Proper Career For A Man. Certainly Not A Man Who Wanted To Marry His Daughter. He Said That Artists Were A Bunch Of... "Sexually Depraved Reprobates, And Drug Addicts". So He Banned Him From The House, And He Locked Me In My Room. He Kept Me There For... Months. If It Hadn't Have Been For Heather, I Don't Know What I'd Have Done. Yes! She Gave Up A Lot To Be With Me During That Time. Yes! God... My Heart! [ Long Sigh ] [ ] [ Mixed Chatter ] Heather: Clear The Way, Get Out Of The Way... [ ] Yes! [ Applause ] [ ] Woo!

God, I'm So Sorry. Are You Okay? Go On! Go On! Okay, Okay. [ Knocking On Door ] Auntie Floss. She Was A Wild One. Hazel... All I Want Is For You And Me, To Be The Same As We Were Before. I Don't Know If That's Possible. I'm Trying To Understand Why You Did It. I Was Afraid. I Was Absolutely Terrified... That He Would Come Back, And He Would Take You Away From Me. And I Can't Bear To Be Without You. Sure, You're My Sister. I'll Always Love You. We'll Just... [ Sigh ] We'll Have To Move On. You Know, Maybe... Maybe We Should Go And Meet Him. Together. In The New Year. [ ] [ Mixed Chatter ] Oh... Well Done. Hello, Donald. I Was, Uh... I Was Saving Them, In Case I Went On The Drink Again. Oh Dear! I Wanted To Do It In Style.
