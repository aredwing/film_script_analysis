Nong has crossed over to the Tip-Osot team... it's been on all the front pages. Let's have a look at the sports pages of the newspaper. Every newspaper is running the same news... Jung: If Nohng stays, I go... Let's have a look at the Tip-Osot team. Last year, it was only Nong. This year, nobody's coming with him. The Iron Ladies have split up. It's the talk of the town. Jung and Nong now face to face... Tip-Osot win 3 matches in a row: No.1... Wow! Who thought up that name? So appropriate. Nong to face Jung in Thai League tomorrow after Nong has stomach operation... Iron Ladies 13, Tip-Osot 15 Brilliant! If you keep playing like this, I'll increase the budget! Look at them! Poor little Jung... all hot and smelly like a bitch on heat! Buffalo queen! That was footage from the final of the Thailand League Cup... ...where our special guest triumphed. And our brightly-colored guest is sitting with us now. Mr Nong! Please... call me "Little Nong." You're now captain of the new Tip-Osot team. You've won 21 times. How many times have you beaten your former team, - the Iron Ladies? - Oh don't ask me that... ...if I answer, it'll sound like I'm showing off. Seven times! Hello? Yes, Governor. I'm watching it. - What was that? - At the time I had no choice. My friends didn't love me anymore. At least April, May and June stood by me. And now I know who my real friends are. I won't ever go back. I'm giving my all to my new team, Tip-Osot. I'm going to make this team the best ever. Bahn, Nhong, our manager and Mr Prasert, It sounds as though those 6 people are all very important to you. Well tonight we have a surprise for you, Little Nong. Would you please welcome April, May and June... ...as well as Bahn, Nong and Mr Prasert! Oh what a surprise! Take a seat, please! Mr Prasert... what did you see in Nong that led you to make him captain? Look at him. Thinks he's Miss Thailand. Mon, when's he gonna let up on us? And when are you going to let it go? You follow his every move. It's like you're fighting over a boyfriend. "Now I know who my real friends are." Yuck! He gets sacked from a road crew for fucking around... ...so we, his friends, help him out by opening this restaurant... ...and he goes and steals all the profits to give to his stupid boyfriend. How can you blame him? He was out of work. That club gave him a job and money. Who would refuse that? Plus they gave scholarships to April, May and June. If only Pia hadn't left her boyfriend and gone to work in China... ...she would have taken care of that... that... THING! What do you want Pia to do? Tell Nong to stop criticizing you... ...or get him to come and play with us again? Well I've got something to say to that! Even if Ricky Martin begged me, I wouldn't play with that buffalo again! Let's go find Pia in China. China! Are you crazy? I'm not going anywhere. Mook! Where are you going? My mother's house... Hold on... I'll finish this then take you. Hello? Oh, it's you Jung. Yeah, okay. Chiang Saen, Northern Thailand. Oh Chai! You jump like you've never been touched by a woman! You're late as usual. If I wasn't told by Coach B... No, never mind. Let's go. What's the rush? We queens like to take our time. By the way, where's Mook? Handsome young man. Such a waste he's gay... Dear Jung... How are you, Toadstool Face? I don't know if I should be thrilled to know you're coming to visit. There are no flights to where I'm living. So I think you should take the goods boat from Chiang Saen along the Mekhong River. It's called the Queen Elizabeth. Once it gets to Kuan Lery, take the bus. That's the best way for you. Let me know when you'll arrive. I shall be waiting to receive you. From Queen Pia. It's like water dripping on a stone for eternity... In the end, the stone wears away. Oh Mook, you should know we're not interested in your husband. Mook kept hearing the local gossip... ...that I was gay like the rest of you in our team. She started to believe it. She's been at her mother's place for a week now. She won't speak to me. When you were in the news, I heard the rumor that the whole team was gay. Oh no, Ma'am, you are so wrong. Chai, wait until we get back from China then you can fix it up. There's no middle ground for us women. It's either love or hate. Like the way you're angry with Nong? Eek! I can't accept what he did. He split the team, made everyone look down on us and now he's threatening us. I'm not making it up. I have proof. Nong hurt over Iron ladies split; forms his own queen team It was as bad as that?! It was even worse than that, sister! I've also brought a video of the buffalo bad-mouthing us on TV. The kid's one of us. One million per cent. Super 1985 "I enjoy life because I'm happy "I'm not trying to make other people laugh "I give you my smile "A real smile from my heart "I have a good time because I love life "I'm never boring; for someone special I would give everything "Don't be scared, I just want to share the dream "Dreams can be made real "The world is pink "Open the door, take a look and cheer us on "We might be spurned, condemned and discouraged "We are ready to take on the world and make them understand "I'm standing here "If you have a place for me I'm waiting for you "To realize that I'm important" Wow! To think our hometown sells ancient clams! Jung! Are you speaking from your mouth or your ass? Is your eyesight that bad? I'm using my mouth to speak! As for my ass, I'm saving that. Saving for what? To ride my bicycle! Byeee! "I enjoy life because I'm happy "I'm not trying to make other people laugh "I give you my smile "A real smile from my heart "I have a good time because I love life "I'm never boring; for someone special I would give everything "Don't be scared, I just want to share the dream "Dreams can be made real "The world is pink "Open the door, take a look and cheer us on "We might be spurned, condemned and discouraged" It's going all hard. I can't move my face. Stop complaining! You're cracking it. If it really works, I'll try it on Jung when he gets home. Speaking of Jung, - should he see a doctor? - Why? Look at him... is he or isn't he? Father! Look what you've done. Stop it! Break it up! That hurts! If you didn't break it up, I would have knocked him out! You're no sumo wrestler. I'm going to check that he's okay next door. I hit him hard. Don't speak to him. He's the worst neighbor in the world. Making fun of Jung. Hey! Never seen a family before? Just you wait! My son's going to make a name for himself! Yes! Our Jung will never get a girl pregnant and dump her! That's right! If you really want to be a wife come to my room! You love me, do you? Oh shit! If you on your own can cause this much trouble... ...I can't imagine what it was like at university with a whole gang of you. Oh. University was so much fun. Let me tell you... it wasn't like we all met by accident. It was like the Seven Samurai... in drag of course. Tell us all about it. And... your boyfriend is so handsome! Ramkhamhaeng University, 1988 Volleyball club! Sign up here! S-s-sorry. No need to apologize. I bumped into you. Are you hurt? You screamed. No bones broken. You two okay? If you are, I'm looking after the volleyball team. Are you going to stay there until you get your degree? It hurts... Quickly. Wit, if you treat me rough like this, we'll never be able to have children. Jung, Wit, when you're finished, you can do another 500. Kamon and Kiat... another 300. Goddamn first-years! It's their fault we're in trouble. Kiat, you get in trouble every day. I'm dead! We practice like this every day and I'm still only a reserve. Surapon only wants the best. And it's only been a week. No. I just want to play for fun. I watched Jung Kochika on TV and wanted to be like her. Is that so? I thought you were here coz you like Wit. You can dangle the bait but I'm not gonna bite. Ann's serious about it though. She wants to be the team manager. Listen, you can call me Mon. I'm a year ahead of you but we'll probably finish together. Let's be friends. Okay, we can be friends... even if you're not the best-looking girl at the ball. Well that makes two of us, honey! Ann, you can go home. No. Mum and Dad are trying to set me up with another guy tonight. Anyway, I have to take May home.

Hey gorgeous, which category should I be competing in? A girl like you has to wait till next life. Come back without a cock and maybe you can apply. But your girlfriend's welcome to apply... in my bedroom. Well dick-for-brains, I'm sorry but I'm not available. So why don't you go home instead? I hear your sister's always hot for you. You're out of line! - Come on. - Kanchit, back off. How about this? We stop cat-fighting like girls. Let's settle this like men. Okay? And now we come to the fun part. The queens have lost. What's their punishment? What? Quiet, quiet. I know what we can do. Let's have them put on a show. Good idea? Party time! Let's go for it! Tonight is on me. Someone left their gold in the shop. Great music. And great guys. Look at those muscles! No need to cruise Lumpini Park anymore. Hey, look at nine o'clock... How are you? Hungry? Nong. Do you know why we're here? All I know is I'm gonna kill you for breaking into my room. We're not finished yet. You said we're unnatural. What kind of real man has posters like this by his bedhead? What the hell are you saying? Everyone has this poster. But what straight guy has Abba, The Carpenters, Gloria Gaynor... ...and Barbra Streisand in the one music collection? And these pictures? Isn't it strange to just have photos of you and your friend Kanchit? Faggots! Dyke! Fucking pervert. I'm not... I'm not a faggot. I'm no different from any other guy. Listen... everything about you... screams "queen". But Kanchit is such a good friend. How he feels about you is not the same as how you feel for him... for sure. These are the words of someone who still doesn't know if he wants a wife... or a husband. What does Dr Jung have to say? Maybe I can explain it this way... Nong, you may not have met the right group of friends yet. Whatever you are... just make up your mind. "I was born a man I want to be a woman "I'll follow my heart Not the direction of others "No more muscles Goodbye to those "I'm changing into a woman And I love it "I was wrong in the past "All over the place made a choice "I can be anything "Call me Vilai! Nongluck! Sajee! "All over the place made a choice "I can be anything "Call me Reuthai, Nongnuch, Yuree!" How cute! Let me have a look. I'm Nohng. What's your name? Who the hell is this guy? Looks like something out of a freak show. Is he a man? A woman? I wouldn't sleep with it. What did you say? Are you mocking me? You take it back along with your products! - Got to fly. Bye! - Huh? What'd he say? "I was born a man I want to be a woman "I'll follow my heart "Not the direction of others "No more muscles Goodbye to those "I'm changing into a woman "And I love it I was wrong in the past" - Kanchit! Kanchit! - Your girlfriend's calling you. No need to worry about child support if you have your way with me! - Hurry up Jung! - Coming, greedy cows! Give me some money to buy something to eat. You're just worried I'll be more beautiful than you. Fat chance! Worried you're more beautiful than me!? I'd be more worried about Ann! Across the hall. They're always fighting. Stupid bitch! I'm only here coz I wanted to try something new! Just 2 more months. the money for the operation. Now he's left me. Who needs him? You've got us now. If he's that stupid, I say let him go. Say bye bye! Good riddance! I've heard you fighting for ages. At first I thought it was a girl fighting with her boyfriend. I didn't take any notice. I had no idea you were at the same university as us. If you don't want to go to class tomorrow, you can stay with us. If there's anything you need just say it. You said "2 months." I was saving money to buy tits, just as he likes. What's the big deal about tits? If you want tits, take mine. They just get in the fucking way. Me, I want to be able to stand when I piss. Oh God. Oh God. Listen to the bull dyke. Okay, then? When I was coming out, these girls helped me. If it weren't for them, I don't know what I'd be today. Oh, you big gorgeous ox! You feel indebted to us! How sweet! Here... there's a bird on your back. See? Brush it off. Ann, brush the bird off the buffalo's back. Hang on. There's one in his mouth, too. Spit it out. Up yours! Ann... what does he mean? Oh never mind. No need to thank us. We know how wonderful we are, especially me. - Cheers everybody. - I gotta get back to work. - Okay, Mon. - I'll get the tab. - There it is! Over there! - I don't see anything! Shhh! They'll hear us. - Oh, look! Beautiful! - Let's see. What? You wouldn't understand, Ann. You're a girl. I think he plays hide and seek. Jung! It's like this. I'll make you reserves. See how it goes for a few days. If you can't hack it, you're out. Is there something wrong? Back off, buffalo! Break it up! Jung! It's my turn to play with Wit! - Wit! - Wit! Sit here with me! No, sit with me, Wit. Are you tired? Are you? Look at all this food. What's the occasion? It's Ann. We're celebrating her engagement. - It's like this, Wit... - Oh look at you! Not only as ugly as sin, but you're clumsy too! I may not be beautiful... but I taste good. Ann had a suitor. Ann had a suitor? But isn't she a...? Exactly. The whole thing just failed. I was at this restaurant with my parents, I told them I couldn't be anybody's wife. Because I'm a lesbian. Mom threw up her shark fin soup immediately. The matchmaker and the boy just ran out of the restaurant. I waited for my father to kick me out. But it wasn't like that at all. My mother hugged me. My father didn't say a word. He just ordered some takeaways. On the way home, they just asked about the team... ...where you guys had disappeared to. Your mother will probably never be able to eat shark fin soup again. Jung! Look! Pia's got boobs now! Pia! Shut the fuck up, will you? - And stop hitting me like that! - See for yourself! Ann's throwing up all over the place... ...and look at the way Wit's taking care of her. Ann. You're too outspoken for your own good. All of you. You're too fucking full on. - Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay - Hey! Hippo fag! If you keep making that noise, everybody on the block will know your secret! Oh! We're all gonna die for sure! You? You could eat rat poison and still not die. Blackout. They happen all the time here, Wit. Because you, Betty bad luck. I haven't slept with a western man yet! I can't die! Help! Somebody help! Nong! Can you shout any louder than that!? I'll tell you something. Angels like us never die. I don't think it's a blackout. If it's not a blackout, what is it? Don't say it... FIRE!!! Fuck! We're all gonna die! I haven't paid my parents back for all they sacrificed for me. I'm too young to die! Imagine... burnt to a crisp. I'll be an ugly corpse. Pia, what are we gonna do? It's all right for you. But what about me? I've just come out. I've hardly put my arse to any use. Calm down. Plug up the gap with my shirt and we'll have more time to breathe. Thank you all for everything you've done for me. You made me what I am today. I want to thank you all, too. Especially Jung. You made volleyball fun. You too, Nong. I'm proud to have been your friend. Wit... I love you. But you're a friggin' dyke! It can't work out. You see... I'm gay. I'm gay! Help me! He's gay! He's gay! Southern China How exotic! How beautiful! - One. One room. - Chai! We're together. Make yourselves at home. - Hey you, wait! - Come on in, Chai! I'm so tired! Relax! It's only me. I'm not Nong, who looks like something out of a scary movie. Then stop sneaking up on me like that! Hey Chai. If you get an itch during the night, don't ask me to scratch it. It was Nong who brought us all together... ...but it was Nong who split us apart. As far as I can see... it's not the big deal you make it out to be. I believe if we all sat down and talked... ...everything would work out. Do you agree? Jung? Why are you playing with the phone? You can't play with it. What if somebody's trying to call? They won't get through. Go and play with your toys. Tip-Osot Volleyball Club - Gently! It hurts! How else are you going to stretch? Gently, gently! Owww! - He's no better, coach. - I'm sorry, sir. Are you up to it, Nong? I'm almost there, sir. We'll do it for you, sir. Listen to the Power Puff Girls over there. I'd lay down my life for the Tip-Osot team! We're all gonna die. You see, we have a small problem. The bosses in Chiang Mai want us to represent District 5. We're in the big league now! If we win, we're in the nationals! If we play for Chiang Mai, we have to play against the Iron Ladies. Exactly. I'm not so sure that we can make it in that league... The plan we call "Three Step" we'll go for nation. It's hard for win. ...unless we get another good player. At present we can't do it. It's difficult. You're right, sir. But there's no drag queen in the country as talented and beautiful as me. Getting Nohng here was a gift from the gods, too. We're like twin sisters separated at birth. It doesn't have to be a drag queen. Look at the Iron Ladies. They have Chai, the straight guy, don't they? You've got a point there. A real man would do. What about Mann... It's Nohng. He's not a real lady-boy. Coach Prasert was just using me. He told Nohng to act like he's gay. He wanted a team like the Iron Ladies. He betrayed me. What can I do? Ask him! Excuse me? Does this bus go to Talor? Talor? Chai, help me here. Taaaaa-Ior? Chai, don't use your shirt. It's dirty. You'll end up with red eyes. Here, use my handkerchief. What's wrong? You should know by now how good I am with my hands! Sorry. I'm used to your hands. I'm just not used to your lifestyle. Goodness. What other straight guy could put up with us? We thought Wit was straight, but... And that girl Ann? I don't hear you all talking about her anymore. May,1992 After Ann was broken-hearted with Wit, she underwent a major change in life and left for USA for a long time. We miss her so much. Fire! More bad luck! This drag queen is not meant to get to Talor. If I'm not mistaken, we should be able to walk to the crossroads. There should be a truck going to Talor. Whatever. You're the man. You lead the way. If it weren't for fucking Nong, we wouldn't be in this predicament. Chai. How much further still we're there? I feel like I'm going to have a miscarriage. Just a little further. We've walked a long way already. Oh why is it so far? Talor. Jinghong. After that bumpy trip no-one's going to believe I'm still a virgin. Did Pia go through this on her way here? She's post-op. She wouldn't have had any problems. This shirt your mother made for us. It's come in handy. - Stop, Jung! Stop! - Get away! Fuck off! You've ruined us! We're bankrupt! Jung. Stop it! Don't! That's my shirt! Get out! Get out! Stop it! That's enough. Nong, I heard that Coach Prasert's team has recruited Kitti. Kitti, who hates us now is their back-up. I'm not sure whether he's with you or not. You're worried about me too, are you? You should be more worried about yourself. Listen Nong. Shut up! I'm worried about you, Nong. All of us are. - We're on the same team. - That's right. We're all in the same boat. Working for the good of volleyball. There's no "my team" and "your team." We've got to work together. I'm not the bad guy. I'm just a manager. And I've got the money. He's got the money. Did you hear that, Nong? You're nothing but a product he wants to buy and sell. I may not be gay, but we have something here... friendship. Nong... And as a friend I'm warning you. You've all had your chance in the spotlight. Now I have an opportunity. Why can't I take it? And don't think this restaurant is the best we can do. I'm not going to let it happen again. - Let what happen? - The day I left the army... on the bus, all the school kids asked for your autograph. They looked right through me. And you just laughed. Excuse me. Are you Thai? I saw your license plates. Hey handsome! Can we hitch a ride! Jung! Chai! What good luck to run into you! We had to hire this van. I'm not sure if it's good or bad luck. Talor, Southern China I'm exhausted, Chai. It's so cold. Oh! Jung! I thought everyone was out. Coach Bee, hello! We missed you so much! How did you get here? Before we left we called you but nobody answered. Wit organized everything. We flew in this afternoon. But Pia said there weren't any flights here. They're testing a new route here. I have a friend who's a steward and he got us on. So did the steward give you "special service"? Are you two here on holidays? Not really. Ask Chai. I don't know either. Ask Pia. Hello Coach! How are things? Pia, you're our own Kylie Minogue! Pia. Your mamasan said there was a guy who comes to watch you every night. Sitting at 10 o'clock. Don't look! Is he the best there is in the whole of China? He takes care of me the best. I've met lots of handsome foreign guys here. This one's no oil painting but he looks after me. He cares. These handsome foreign guys ...any for me? Only the blind retarded ones. Give me a break. I'm the happiest I've ever been. So coach... how are you? Are you happy? I've been trying to sort out what's going on but I still don't know... and now Nong's up on stage. Nong's learnt his lesson. He's very upset. Chai. When success knocks on your front door... friendship goes out the back door. Nong... he's changed. Any nice big ones? I like nice big ones. How many of you are there? - 9 of us. - How many men? Only one. The rest of us are girls! Where do you think you guys are going? Get back here! Pia. It's time for you to introduce us to your man. We're all friends. Leave her alone. She'll introduce us when she's ready. Butt out. Coach, this is Doi. - Hello. - Hello. Doi-licious, if you ask me. Nobody asked you, face-ache. It's like this. Doi is the president of the local sports club. He'd like the Iron Ladies to play his team. Good! We need the practice before we go back to Thailand. I saw you on TV... The Iron Ladies are very good! We'd like to see you in action. Wow! Let's get married. Oh my God! Chai, help! Pia! I don't believe it. The Iron Ladies finally get to play internationally. This is what Chai always wanted. To play in another country. Ladies... it's time. If we'd known this many people were coming, we could have sold tickets... or our bodies. Let's see if we're still good enough to represent Lampang in Thailand. Ladies... Iron Ladies! "From here it's like time has stopped "and returned to the olden days "Our friends went in search of their dreams "and have come back to us "Do you believe me? I hear the sounds of music in the air "And pictures from yesterday are safe in my heart "Those smiles that I had forgotten. "How can you smile like that?

"It's easy when I see you" - Chai, what do they call this? - It's a kind of curry. And this? What's this? Frog or fish? Young man? How would you like a beautiful wife? My daughter wants a Thai husband. If you want a beautiful wife, take my daughter. I already have a wife... and two daughters. - Two daughters? - Excuse me. The women here are very forward. The women here see people going to work in Thailand. They come back with lots of money. But they get cheated into selling themselves. The women think if they get a Thai husband they'll have an easy life. They get tricked into prostitution. Coach Bee, have you come to a decision about us playing in Lampang? I don't know if I've made a rash decision but... I got Jung's mother to make these. These are for everyone. Fabulous color! Sensational! I'm going to the bathroom. I've always been jealous of you. No matter what you do, you're so confident. I have to wait for you to tell me what to do. My parents never cared for me the way yours do. Ever since I've known you... you've always been the bigger star. Sometimes I think... I'd like to be like you. It'd probably be a good thing. It's only now I realize... ...you didn't want to steal my thunder. You cared about me. Why didn't I think of that before? Even Coach Bee... ...we're all friends. Everyone cares about me. I thought you were all jealous of me. Like I was jealous of you. Jung, do you hear me? Are you listening to me? Did you hear what I said? Did you hear? Can't a guy take a shit in peace? It's okay... I forgive you. As long as you admit I'm prettier than you... you big ox. Okay, I admit it. But keep it between us. - Lightning strikes! - Slip the tongue in! It's going to rain. Quick come inside! Live broadcasting from Thung Dock Buatong in Mae Hong Son Province. District 5 Welcome to the live broadcast of the Volleyball Grand Final for District 5. The winner will enter the National Finals. This is a historical match that's being telecast nationwide. It's a clash between Lampang and Chiang Mai. It's well known already that the Chiang Mai team this year is the entire Tip-Osot team. More surprising, they're all carbon copies of the Iron Ladies team. Even the ratio of straight guys to gay guys is the same! Nong and Nohng... Jung and Jin... even the three little reserves. The Chiang Mai has trounced all its opposition throughout the tournament. The Iron Ladies haven't been so triumphant, losing some. That's probably because Nong has been out due to injury after the Thai League. Chiang Mai lost to the Iron Ladies last time. This time round things are different... the two teams look alike! Our cameras have captured both teams for you to see. They're like two peas in a pod. Here's footage from yesterday. What was each team thinking? Hurry up! We're gonna kick those Iron Pussies. Cheer us on like you did before! Get out your smelling salts! You're gonna need them. There's been nothing like this since Alexis and Crystal faced off over Blake Carrington! It's a catfight to the death. Keep watching. Let's cross to the stadium. Dammit! How're you feeling, Iron Slags? Viewers... lightning never strikes the same place twice! Chiang Mai leads Lampang 2-0. We're finished! My mouth's as dry as a nun's nasty. Listen. Lighten up. Don't be afraid of them. Remember it wasn't luck that got us this far. Yes. We're down only 2 sets. Listen. The next set. They'll put three up for the block. I need you. Can you do it? - Sure. - Then Nong and Chai... you've got to attack from the back of the court. How do you know they'll play a three-man block? I've got spies. Don't forget we have lots of supporters. Wow! My apologies, viewers. Fantastic! The Iron Ladies have found their old form! The Iron Ladies have won the right to serve! Let's see if they can get the first point in the set. Fucking faggot! Go strut your stuff somewhere else. Mann... don't forget I'm just playing a part. Okay? - You're so cruel. - How exciting! This third set. The lead keeps changing. No-one can say who's going to win... ...the real Iron ladies or the fake ones? If you fuck this up, the sponsors will pull out. I've invested a lot in you... and I don't want to lose it. I want you guys to have a good life. If you keep playing like this, you can forget about your house repayments. Stop dreaming, concentrate. Time out! Venerable Gods of the Volleyball Court... please make the Iron Ladies win. If they do, I'll get promoted to District Governor. So only an act of God can help you? We drag queens have more power than a silly old act of God! Isn't that right? Mon! Mon! Spike! Chai, stay down! April, stay in the center. As for Nong... - Yes? - Hit the ball from the back. May and June, stand by. Understand? - Got it! - Mon... Mon... you have to be there to back up Pia. As for Chai... stay to the left. - Okay. - How many players is that? Follow this. Go on the attack. Understand? Understand? Clear? Coach, why don't you sit down and take some deep breaths? Okay. - Jung! - Yes? We gotta get that first ball. Whatever happens, don't lose it. Just keep the ball in play. Chai don't worry about me. I can jump, spike, set... but look at Nohng. - He's like a lame horse. - Oh! Look at your face! Quick! My make-up! Look at it! Oh God! That must have hurt! Lampang 10, Chiang Mai 9 Lampang 11, Chiang Mai 10 - Coach! Time out! - Time out! Time out! Sir... if anything happens... Look after me, okay? If our team wasn't so fucking terrible, these Iron Faggots wouldn't have a chance. This set-up's not working. If we can't beat them from the sides, we can't win. They win. Special time out! Officials need to clear the court... and the broken light. How did you get here? - And where's Mommy? - Go Iron Ladies! Go Iron Ladies! What're you staring at? Go Iron Ladies! Chai. I must apologize. The truth is, I should have understood you better. I was wrong. Never mind, Mook. I understand. But while I'm in this team, you have to accept things. People whisper about me all the time. I'm sick of it too. But it's okay. I've gotten over it. The truth is, I haven't been feeling myself lately. Maybe it's because... - Tell your father. Go on. - Mommy's having a baby. Both teams have to play hard and hold their serves as long as they can in order to win. Right. Every time these two teams meet, there's blood on the volleyball court. - Especially in the final set! - Yes. You think you're as good as me? You fucking straight! Concrete mixer! Just you wait! Lampang 13, Chiang Mai 14. The place is jumping! It's down to the wire in this exciting finish! Yes! There's going to be a lot of money in hospital fees today! There's one thing left that can make you win. It's nothing I can tell you. It comes from within you. Your enemy is in front of you. You're on equal footing now. It's the last set. Go get 'em. Nong! You gotta do it. Get up and get 'em! Show that Prasert what the real Iron Ladies are made of! Is everyone okay? Okay! We may be beautiful, but we're also as tough as nails! Right! You're beautiful and tough. Let's do it! Come on Iron ladies! Never mind. Come over here. If Nong hadn't touched the net before the ball hit the ground... ...the Iron Ladies would have still been in the game. They would have had a chance. What a pity. Yes. Luck has changed from one hand to the other. If only Nong hadn't fouled that last shot. Never mind. It was a great game from the Iron Ladies. They're a great time. A great team! We might have lost the volleyball, but we drag queens never say die! - Isn't that right girls? - Yes! Yes! Iron ladies never say die! Could I ask a few questions? How do you feel about your win? It was expected. Sport always has winners and losers. The truth is, I wonder what the result would have been - if I'd been the Iron Ladies' manager. - Would they have you? I think talented people should work together. Look! Ann's sent us a photo of her husband and kids! She says we'll all be jealous for sure. Coach, a few questions... Just then the winning team called themselves "Iron Ladies 2". How do you feel about that? I think if we're so good they want to take our name, then we're flattered. What about these rumors of a movie about the Iron ladies? Oh! Oh please let it be true! A movie about us? But who'd go and see it? - We have to go. Bye! - Wait a minute! How come you're so gracious in defeat? We have to go pay homage to the Gods. Did you make a promise to the Gods? No need to pay homage... we lost, Jung! - Exactly. - I didn't ask the Gods for us to win. I was afraid if we won, we'd split up again. You're not disappointed? - Excuse us. - Thank you. Bye bye! Look Nong! Ann's got a gorgeous western hubby! Okay, ladies. Ready? And ever since that day, the Iron Ladies haven't won a single championship. Written and directed by Yongyoot Thongkongtoon
