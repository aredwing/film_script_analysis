Look at this! - Yes, I know. All I'm bigger, I started to grow! - No, you look good! Tricia, your baby is huge! - Yes! I know. I'm glad to see you. Well, let's go inside. - OK, good idea! So cars are you? - It was great, everyone should try once. And what you're going through? - On the southern road, highway 66th Texas is simply ... Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I was out there ... I did not expect so soon, maybe early afternoon or later. Yes, I drove all night, I wanted to be there as soon as possible. These are the last pieces, I realized that it still can be used. Tonight we could apply a formal ... - Yes, of course. God, it's really good to see you again. - And you. The bed is amazing. - Yes, it's great. As a quality mattress. - It's great, I've slept in worse beds. Both know that. I made a couple of small things nephew, or cousin, or who already. Callie. - Do not get excited much. I was goodwill. From New Mexico's. Nothing special, but this is what I wanted to make. Are you sure this is not a problem? I do not want to feel ... No, I'm good juice and soda. Are you sure that this will not disrupt your ... I'm fine. - So, here's to you. I'm really glad you're here. I know what happened in Vermont in Pennsylvania, and my mother mentioned something about North Dakota. - Yes ... I lived in my car, That was really cool. But mostly in Worcester. Ohio? - Yes, I was in Ohio longest couple of months. And later in Louisiana, I've already told you. - Oh, yes! I know, I know! After everything that had happened, it was amazing. - Yes ... - This is amazing. And, what was this clinic in Louisiana? Okay, now let's talk about your pregnancy. Come on! No! Calm down, sister. - Who was that? Some mannequin, water polo, the gardener? The mother has gone crazy? No, my mother was actually happy. Father has not told you. Fuck him, especially if you do not find the guy who knocked her up. I'm just damn curious. - Well, we shall later on. I'm going to clean up the kitchen. - Good ... gigantic whore! The giant drug addict. Basically, everything has remained the same since my last visit. God, 5 years ago? - It was just after you left, so ... I see, I've removed the wedding images. At first I did not want anything to change. Just ... You know, in case one day return ... I did not want to change things later, because ... I do not know. - Of course, of course. Death in absentia ... - I know, it sounds a lot ... I did not know that there will be paperwork. Yes, I do, very much. Final Report / i The paperwork is done, Police gave the death certificate of origin, I gave osigurnaje agency, and a few financiers. Had an impact on many things, you know, insurance and vehicle registration ... life insurance, retirement savings account ... - You might think ... that after 7 years will not return home? When someone once declared dead, that's another story. Dead, gone ... unlikely to occur. So you need not wait that long ... Seven years ... OK, I get it. There is no need. A cry? I printed them so much that sometimes I get to replace them. So I saw a couple of torn on the tree ... - You ask a? These are the last ones. Last ... Can I ask you something? You know, if it is not ... Ask. - What ... What do you think, you know, about all of this? At first I thought he was gone, because we fought. Marriage has already become excruciating. Then I thought of the amnesia. Strays do not remember anything. Start over, and now he is happy. Remember me sometimes, but I do not know why. I have millions of versions. He was a secret agent. Must not say what he lives. That I was safe. But after it was exposed, and now lives in incognito. But still I am always watching ... All the time. Ride. The entire first year was marked by speculation that it could happen. Kidnapping, escape from home, alien abductions. Anything. It was so nice to me. Addressing me as "my child" ... It is not staring at me. I was not kidding, I was not bothered about the circuit ... I loved it. He would be proud of you to be cleared. Yes ... I know I would. Well, now I'm going, no matter which version I izaabrati. Sitting on the patio, watching the sunset, happy and alive and OK. Hey, I'm here to help you with the paperwork and you ... help pack their things for the new apartment. - Are looking for, but I'll find it. Of course! I know, I will keep you hands on ultrasound or whatever ... I was just there. And then, what? Where will you go after? Danny? Honey? disappeared / i Award! Lost a cat / i Lost pet Award / i Award! Zoe is gone / i Fuck! - Please ... I'm sorry ... - Please ... I'm sorry, I do not have anything on me. - Can you see me? I do not have anything with me what I could give. - Wait, wait ... Sleeping. What? - I do not know. I'm sorry, I did not mean to wake you. - I'm here ... I ... I ... Trading. - What? - Trading. No, I really do not have anything. I'm sorry. Walter. - Walter? I'll get you later. - Please ... I'll be back and I will give you ... I'll bring you something, okay? Wait, wait! My son! ... My lad ... Jamie ...! Will you ... will you tell him? Bye. I'm sorry, I'm just ... Anyway. Bye. Bye. Callie ... my sister, this is Detective Mallory. It works, that is, he has worked on Daniel's case. Hi! You're not the first guy I met here, I mean ... The guy that was there before the ... No. I have set only a few years ago. He was moved to a new ... Anyway, I'm glad to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Really, why? Now I ... - They reported a burglary in the area ... I need to write another report, in fact ... did not have any value, you know. There are thieves in the area, holding the door shut. In this environment does not happen a lot. Years trying to persuade your sister that stayed away, even from here. Take this to your lawyer. I'll do whatever is necessary to the case. I will. - Super. - I'll take a shower, the smell of armpits asshole. Nice to meet you Yes, you were right. - Yes. You'll call me when you're done with a lawyer? I'll call you. Do you need anything ... from ... - I'm good, I'll be fine. Right. Because they can not provide anything, if you are harassed. I can give you guns. - Stunner, huh? Big guy. I know what you did. / i Shit! Hey, is there any food to another plate? Are you still hungry? - No, this guy ... Anyway. It is the Christian thing. Yes! In fact, I wanted to ask you about this Christian thing. Can I have some bread, please? Yes Trish, do you want me to help you? I'm just ... maybe not tonight, you know? Then tomorrow, can not wait. Technically, most of the time waiting for a signature ... I'm working on it, okay? I'm working on it. Please, help them fulfill their mission. In the name of Jesus, amen. Callie? This is normal. Well, screw the normal things. These, we call lucid dreams, that you have. They started at the time when you declared dead in absentia. I know we talked about how we would do something ... Because it's a big deal. And we were expecting something. But not this. Not this. Lucid dreams can be explained as visual, auditory, and even olfactory and tactile halucanicije. And it's not uncommon for people who, like you, deal with stress. Okay, this is good, keep going. How do you feel when you see it, you hear it? The first time was such that he was totally out of line. Angry. - Because you ... Because I declared it dead. And after? - After I was full of anger. For me and ... - And the baby. And the baby. A mind can not immediately deal with ... trauma. With sadness, feelings of guilt. Sometimes it's easier to create something that will help us to process it all. But it is you, Tricia, not him ... I tell myself that how you feel. Okay, but when will this all end? You're the only one who can answer that. I still meditate? Still help you ... - Yes. Yes, absolutely. - Okay, okay. Do not. Please? Do not leave it there. They are not mine, they just come back. Do not. This looks good. Do you need something from the police? - No, no, no. This is good. He disappeared from his place of residence for a period of seven years. I will continue to run as gone, without any explanation, and you will receive all of his assets. I think you did a great job. So now what? - Arhivisati. I think that this will get the obituary. You should sign a petition last part. Thank you. That's it. Hey ... Hey. I'm going to lie, I'm tired. - Go to sleep, I go in a minute. Valid. Good night. - Good night. Shit! It's disgusting! May God bless you, nephew or cousin, whatever you are. That's all? - I think so. I'm not sure what ... - Robbery was reported on Broadway. - Admission. Yes? - It seems that personal description matches g. Adams. Is it? - I'm not quite sure. - Of course. Can I borrow it? - Of course. - Thank you. The door was locked. - I think. This we have already discussed, in this county always shut the door. I told her! I'm sure it was locked. There was no sign of forced intrusion, so ... Before that, there was another incident. - Sorry, I kind of incident? The man in the tunnel, you say? - Yes, I'm trying to remember ... I can not remember what he called it ... He was talking nonsense, anyway. - A fool who talks out of the tunnel ... nonsense was in my apartment? Great, Callie, really amazing.

We talked again with Daniel. Sleeping. - We can wait a while. 've Already talked with him in the hospital, you do not say anything. When we spoke with him again in the place where you feel better ... Daniel! There is. How do you feel, Daniel? I called the doctor. He found that these spots in the images. My stomach you had animal bones. Daniel, can you explain that? The hospital also revealed that the clothes you wore, same one you wore when you're gone. This means that the whole time you were in the hospital, but you are hiding somewhere? - I do not know. You see, Daniel ... You know, Daniel, because someone has fed. And just yesterday morning. - Daniel, please. Wallet've had. Your wallet.

Until then, if you need something ... - Do not ... - Please, take it. I'll drop by about 10 Can we talk? I do not know. - Just to talk. It can? Yes. - After 10th Bye. Bye. When you last saw me, I barely knew to drive, remember? And you're gone. Yes, that's right. I did. I was chasing a guy and a couple of dragons ... There is so much I do not want to think about it anymore. How did you get out? I do not know. Could you leave us alone? Of course, of course. If you want to talk ... Well? Los Angeles, Ministry of Health - declared dead / i No No Where did you ... where have you been, man? I'm here. I'm not asking you to decide today. Or add another burden in your life. The whole situation is impossible. - I just want to say that I have committed. I will not stop, I will not leave you. I gird you, protect you and your baby. I'll do anything to help Daniel. I'm still the same guy. But he did not. It is no longer the same one who left. Remember how you said that things were not so great. - Do not ... Sorry, I just want to say that this obituary ... ... Correct. Even if it is on the floor. Jesus! Are you okay? It is not as it seems. It is more like an insect. Bright as the silver fish. Tricia! Trampala you are with him. I wish you had not. Haunts. Daniel, I think you should go back to your room ... Tricia and wait. Do not ... I can not go back. Inside the walls of the team. Maybe he'll go. Do more, do not. Do not ... Do more ... Do more ... Quiet, Daniel. Stop. Enough said. I assure you that you will be absent from the child's life. Tricia ... - You always said you'd give it back. And you're back. And I love you for it. I see. And so I wanted ... I wanted to go away for the weekend. Sleep under the stars ... and no one wanted to know whether I would ever return. I understand ... I understand why it's ... just go and leave this mess and said, "I do not care all." I do not know ... Ryan? Are you ...? - No! Tricia! Tricia, he's gone! He's gone! He's gone! He's gone! It's gone ...! There's no one inside. What happened? Daniel, Daniel! Daniel! Callie? Daniel! I know it sounds weird, but I swear, I swear I heard it in the walls. Daniel! He shouted. - It's okay, right? Daniel! I will examine you, right? Look me in the eye. Everything is OK. Were you drinking something? Something I should know? I drank a glass of wine a few moments ago. Right. Later we will talk to you, okay? - Yes. Fucking asshole. There is. You've seen her eyes? - Yes, eyeballs, I know. But this means that nafiksala. - No, you should search Park, main roads, I do not care ... - It will cost a large, you know. I know that you love her, but it does not help you. - I know. I'll need her statement. But we will have to make changes in her story ... I know. You want to write her ... Statement ...? No. No, I think I can and I do. I was definitely ask for some things. You'll have to ... I do not know how to tell you. I'm sorry, I just ... Oh, Jesus. Can be? You'll have to sign a paper about a missing person. Tricia, my God, I'm so sorry. - Shut up! Hey! I saw your eyes, you're buzzing around the apartment! Where is it? No, fuck! Listen! I saw it! You're hallucinating! - I saw. Jesus! Do not believe me? He can not go a day without Callienih "trip"! It happened! I would not believe I did not see that! Well, well, well! What would happen if it were not so, as I say? While you were doing and where have you been, what would happen, Tricia? I do not know! But the last time I heard that story about the big beetle, while you were still on drugs, remember? Okay, but it happened! - There will be no change there! Father left, my mother was mad, Callie and tries to solve their problems with a needle! But at least I did not screw up his marriage with a guy from high school ... missing / i list of missing persons / i Hi, Ruth, Tricia here. You're probably already on the plane, but ... listen ... Hey ... Hey ... I'm sorry ... - No, it is pointless. I think I figured out what it actually does. Right. Walter Lambert lived three houses from us, disappeared in 1995, on his way to work. Guess where he went. He left behind a son, who now lives there. He is convinced that his father was kidnapped by a monster. Walter declared dead 2002nd year. I saw him last week. Guess where. It could be a coincidence, but he's not the only one, not even close. In the last 100 years, a number of people missing from the environment. The tunnel was not there 100 years ago. - Exactly. The highway was built in the early fifties, but before that, and, no kidding, there was a natural formation, they built a bridge there, and you know what? People began to disappear. In 1928, Charles Ashford went to fetch water from domestic wells. Cross the bridge ... Family searches. No trace of him. The traces left by the led to the source. Not enough? Three students, on the cover of the LA Times, After their failure in the system of underground caves, the Verdugo hills, where it connects with the long tunnel into the valley. They could not find the tunnel ... Listen! This is important. They said that beneath the city. Not underground, but underground. - Jesus, Callie. No, look, 1968, David Stone ... he went to a party, three buildings away, began to behave strangely and wandered onto the neighbor's property. He did not know where he was going, what he's doing, he just said that he was being chased. Callie, when the mind knows not cope with a terrible situation ... Do you know that in this country there are 109,000 reported missing? Guess how many of them disappeared in the tunnel. - The mind creates the schema. I saw horrible things, right? Terrible things, that seemed so real. Myths, legends, folklore. - It is easier to imagine the scariest fantasies but to accept the truth. - Tricia, every culture in history has such myths in which monsters abduct people. Dragged them into a surreal underworld, make slaves of them ... It is easier to cope with the worst nightmare, but to accept the fact how stupid and simple this world. Take the legends of trolls, demons, Egyptian, banshee, Wendigo. There are records of all this! Just ... we need to find ... Well ... Dark matter, tangential dimension ... If everything is made of atoms, and atoms are mostly empty space, then how can anything be tight. Things disappear in this environment, and always disappearing. And these things occur in one and the same place. I love you, Callie. Tricia. How is he? Where is it? Hi ... Tric ... - Daniel! I have to tell you something. Come on in, sit down ... Sit ... Ma'am. - What's going on? - I need to talk to your sister for a while. What's going on? - They found a body in the tunnel, and the need to identify ... No, ma'am, come back, please! Do not go there! What happened? Oh, God! Oh, God! It is on ... This is Walter Lambert. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! - I'm sorry! But you have to stay here! Hold it ...! Keep it. Keep it. Shit! Hey! I will not stay long. Your father ... - I told you I was not dead. I'm sorry. There are many animals perished in this environment, and I want to know what the dog is looking at that bag of garbage? Just wanna go home. - I know, otherwise I'll go to your neighbors and ask them about all the burglaries. I'll ask them about the disappearance of animals. And they would tell me that Jamie Lambert is a "good" guy. I just want to sleep. And I want you to give me any information. Anything, and I'll send you home, you will get help. If you need. I turned to you for help, but you could not help. If you want to help me, help me, then ... to bury his father, please. Yes, in that I can help you. Okay, we're done. Bye. Hi, sis. How you doing meditation? - Well, come sit next to me. So just sitting here thinking about? - I know. I'm trying ... I'm trying, really ... get rid of the attachment ... the source of pain. I'm trying to find, so I do not know, nirvana. What is nothingness, is not it? Do potcijenjivati attractiveness of nothingness. At least until they live out a little longer. Even if I close my eyes, I still see the body on the sidewalk. Yes, I know, and I remembered that. Could it be he. Could it be ... Daniel Pomotano way. Poor Daniel. Do you know that the Church says ... There are people whom she calls "the sacrificial spirit"? - Really? People that God just leave ... He plays the devil and demons to make their own. As if they were destined to suffer ... in return for a large reward in heaven. I'm not going to call the prodigal ... or hit you. I know I am now. I think sometimes you have really good ideas. Itself're led by an unknown horizon and trying to unravel. I never thought anything bad about you. I think I'm damn fucked up. At this point. This one has a fucking middle of the day, all of which gives me the creeps. Am I to assume that this is going to end like this? Am I able to know at all? Tricia. Gone / i Gone / i disappeared / i Yes, I know. We want something to drink? - You can not. Right? Once again from scratch. Well ... Something I do not understand. The officers found a room in your ... I heard something about you. Who do you hang out. What you're doing is wrong. No, very bad! I can do what I want. So ... we will have to test your blood. Has a lot of questions. You are the only person of interest. I do not plan to leave town any time soon? - I do not. We will not stop searching even for an instant. - Just a moment, and continue, but ... Before we go on all of this ... you will need to sign the report of a missing person. Stay close, miss. missing students were found near the cave / i Trump / i Trump / i Trump / i Trump / i Beware of underground stuff / i Ryan ... Ryan ... You know, because ... You know that you do not have to tell this, but ... - I know. The case will remain open. Indefinitely. Whatever it takes. - I know. Hey, I said to myself, this is not about speculation. It is about what we know and what is not. I mean, we know that they lived not far from the man which demonstrated the typical symptoms of a serial killer. And it's just a matter of time ... when these animals ... His house was searched and he was questioned, that's all I know ... Maybe it's just simply gone, leaving this mess and said: I do not care all. Or something like that. She has lived in the country. - Sometimes we went on a camping trip. She went on a camping trip and was able to just go away ... away from the camp itself and be just fine. And her sister? She used the drug, the drug is kept in an apartment ... She ran off. She picked up her bag, and went back. Maybe they escaped together. No No Just because you can not invent a scenario that took Tricia out of the apartment and out of range, with a baby in arms, happy and satisfied ... I know. - Living without money, no credit cards and no car. This does not mean that such a scenario does not exist. Of course that means. Strange things are happening. People disappear, some find. No she did not wish the worst. Never. Not them.
