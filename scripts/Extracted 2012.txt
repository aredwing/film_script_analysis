I would do anything to hear her voice. I am a prisoner in a prison, I have created. - I'm bored again, Minnie. - What will you do now, Tom? - We go somewhere else. - Six minutes to rendering. Now what? He is well with it? Well, it happens. He was very enthusiastic. End up living in a garage and beg for scholarships. When I asked for a date, I said, that it pays off in the long run. - So you said that you have a guy. - No. - No! - Okay, so I'm wrong. - What is it? - Open it. - We can not afford. - Not yet. But we get. You have to take it on tonight. I must follow in the evening. Both. - Five minutes left, Tom. - We have an offer. - Fantastic. - Do not be too eager. They will know how good it is. What do we do with false memories? The machine detects difference of true and false memories. Brainwashing is difficult. I have a solution. If they have a latent memory on brainwashing- - as hypnosis, cult thing or something... The controls for the first. Do the nothing is reminded true. Customer has an idea. Simply... Now set to go into other people's memories? - Why would you do that? - Where do I start? See if children have been abused. Alzheimer's... Richard, I said clearly what I wanted. - I'm just asking. - Sell my machine, nothing else. I tried. This is what they came with. - As who came with? - All! You do not get the amount of money you want, without some compromises. Do you want to just help people, can do so without payment. What they offered? It is unethical! You built it to find trauma. - It also makes it now. - They do not let you control. - Yes. How to get the machine. - How it begins. We have debt, you are pregnant. I deserve more than just clear me! Rendering ready in three minutes. FIRST OF MANY I come to you with money. Enough to get started? Yes... Yes, that's enough. - But who is the investor? - Someone who understands potential. Remember that you own rights you control. He has a few questions. The machine I tried, worked fine. Why build a new one? Upgrades. Now any user guidance. You have to go where you want, on their own. - So I dive into the memory... - Do you hear me, Richard? Yes! I hear you, Tom! Nja, memories are sorted first. We create a traffic management space, a starting place. - How to start site look like? - Maybe this place? - This house? - Yes, until we find something else. - Something more interesting? - Yes. Okay. I'm starting to catch it. - We need a voice. - I'll do it. - What? - Why not a little more style? Maybe an actress? It will they think of. - Does my voice not style? - No. Jae, yes, yes. - How was it? - Fine. We take z, then we are finished. - How does it look? - Zi, za, zo, zta. - Very good. - I mean voice, Romeo. Yes. The same there. Your memory is ready, Tom. - Your memory is ready, Tom. - Here we go. So I'm at the starting point, find my memory and there? - Is it that simple? - Yes, it's that simple. - How far in memory when? - So far it seems one. Borders appears at its edge of an impenetrable gate. World consists of what exists, and what it creates. Things and people. Even after leave to no permanent trace. - And how to get out? - With extraktoren. And if something goes wrong? We are working on it. Minnie? Destroy yourself, please. Selvdelgger in five, four... Three, two, one. Goodbye, Tom. Destruction failed. Remember: I'm not evil. Do I diagnose again? - How long have I been stuck? - 4 years, 2 months, 3 days. Are you ready? I do not know if I have a life outside this place. Or if anyone knows I live. FAR, COM HOME Hello? Honey, it's Richard. Hello. Tomorrow night? We should have six weeks. To invest requires the presentation now. Think of all the things we have not tested. Dummyminderne. - Unknown faces. - Apply yourself. - And the pictures? - Just take something. Richard understands it. Okay, but I protest. An official protest. Quoted. Now we go. - Ready? - Yes. - I love you. - I love you. Do not fall asleep before I come. - Where do you want it? - Just put it there. What is this? - Who are your investors? - It's complicated. So make it simpler. Who the hell is that? Arthur Kennison from prison. They will go into in suspect's memories. - Then you know whether they are guilty. - Should it be voluntary? No. Does it work, it becomes mandatory. Beautiful U-turn. I can pack up in a hurry... - Do not get involved. - I trusted you. - You said nothing for half a year. - Jo, "one who sees potential". They do. - I'll give you a chance. - You will give you a chance. Okay. Maybe I'll contribute something important. Realize others working on this. You are only but soon catching up to you. - I had a vision. Not so. - Forget it. It's all about control! Yes! Do you think you can take their money without consequences? How long have you worked on this? Think about it. Think of your family, Tom. Mr. Jacobs? Should we do it? We begin. - Who we enter? - We arrested him recently. His name is Anthony Willis. His father's assassin for the Mafia, a loser. - What has he done? - He's a drug addict. He is tall, gets an SMS from his girl, running home to her. And kill her. Supposedly. He blackout, he said. Do you understand something of his brain, I am interested. - Forced In him here? - He is happy to get the chance. A perfect guinea pig. Willing and worthless. He seems like a nice guy. Just a sedative. The process does not hurt. Maybe not for me. It goes wild for up there. It takes just a few seconds. - Why stun him? - It makes everything more stable. Tom? We're ready. I need the details now. You must surely know? Man seeking a recall of million. Give me the details. Okay, I buy. Man's file. Someone saw his car on a bridge at the crime scene at. 02.00. An hour after her death. We searched the area and found murder weapon with his prints. We begin. Good luck. Tom, can you hear me? Tom, can you hear me? Tom, can you hear me? I hear you. Minnie, you hear me? Welcome, Tom. My name is Minnie. What will you do? - Show all I see on the screen. - As you wish, Tom. - We see it crystal clear. - Good. Search memories with the following words: Adrienne, murder, Regan. Seeking. A memorial found with the words. Take me there. FROM Adrienne: MAY NOT BE WITH YOUR LIFE LONG. I am inside. Adrienne, shut up! - That I do not remember. - The machine fills holes. How long does it take for something? I'm sorry. - How much of it is real? - Processing. Background Authenticity 17%. Normal values. And the actions? - 95% - 95th Very fine for a memorial. Father that something awful has happened. Memory is over, Tom. This is what we pieced together. He took methadone to fall, called his father and disappeared. So he lied about to not remember anything? Maybe not consciously. Addicts often have blackouts. So now he thinks that he is innocent. I must say that I am very impressed , Tom. Get me out now, Gary. Goodbye, Tom. - What the hell? - What will you do now? Gary, I'm back at the start. Strange. I try again. Goodbye, Tom. Welcome, Tom. What will you do? - It did not work. - What happens? - What the hell is going on? - Extraktionen does not work. Get it now fixed. A kind of misunderstanding. He is working on it. Just remove all we'll fix it later. - No "I told you so" afterwards. - Forget it. - Minnie, destroy yourself. - Are you sure? Yes. Self Destruction in five, four, three, two... ... A. Goodbye, Tom. - Why he wakes right? - I do not know. The destroyed itself. Chip loosens and dissolves in the blood. Yes, it's gone. Why is he still? Tom, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Tom? You're not listening. I did not. You were high, you took the gun from her... - No! - See, Anthony. You did it. You have fablet for three days. Confessions now! You took the gun and shot her. Bang! You have a visitor. Hi, Dad. - You look thin. Do you eat? - Yes. I would give it to you. Did some photos in the attic. Thank you. They began in a carpentry course last week. It's very interesting. I want to be a carpenter. - You look very thin. - Yes, you said. I do not do drugs. They are harder, they can not be obtained. You say, but I do not believe you. - What are you doing? - Happy? Not the position. Your job is to be clean. I could. - You must not fail. - I give you my word. Does not that mean anything? Not for me. It's always nice talking to you, Dad. Sit! Sit! Sit now! - What should I do, Dad? - Repeat, I said. Do you want the dog to sit, then press it down and repeat. Sit! Sit! You, give me a 38 millimeter. - It was 15 - It was 15 I'm sorry. How. We should buy a birthday gift for your mother. - A car? - A car? - Yes. - Are you crazy? - How often have I been reminded? - 430 times. It must be the music, who lures. - What date is it out there? - 15 July. Aw, we missed the fireworks. Tomorrow we must find a celebration. Picnic, barbecue? What do you think? - I do not understand the question. - No, that's clear. But it could be nice. Sit! Sit! Sit! I've said 100 times, that is too stupid! Give dad a beer. Minnie, what the hell was that? He saw me. - It is impossible. - Stop now, he saw me. You, Anthony. Anthony! Look at me! Thank you, my boy. Am I going crazy? He saw me. Your theory is impossible. Begin again, before he asked for beer. Beginner again. I've said 100 times, it's too stupid. Give dad a beer. You, Anthony! Anthony! Look at me! Can you see me? Thank you, my boy. He looked at me, Minnie. I'm sure. The process was repeated three times. Your theory seems unlikely. What was so special at the memorial? At that particular time? What was the bell, when I said that he saw me? I do not have exact time of memory. No, the time in fact. Time was 04.15, fifth July. View reminded of what Anthony did then. Scanner short-term memory. See. He sees me there, right? Lights are switched off in five minutes. He thought of the memorial. He thought of memory, when I was in it. An active memory. So he saw me, Minnie. - I can not confirm the theory. - It is not necessary. Anthony PHOTOS We shall meet him again. The memorial, he thinks most? I can not search per frequency. Talk about memories, he can not help but think of? A therapy session, a confession? Locates. I think about it all the time. I was with a friend. A part-time drug dealer, Eric Lowe. A very nasty type. Take me to the memorial, Minnie. I should have a fix. I needed money and had only one idea. How long should we wait? If I can not things to my brother, he bitches me. - There. - He he it upon themselves? - Okay. - What the hell is that? - Do you use shoe? - So give it to me. - Forget it. - Give it to me! Take it. - Store idiot. - Do not worry, boss. Now we drive. - Money. Give them to me. - You know who you bother? No. Tell who I bother. Do not make me to cut you, bessefar. - What the hell are you doing? - What the hell are you doing? I want to see your face before I shoot it, you fucking idiot. Father? The day haunts me. He saw how deeply I was sunk. I began to think of Adrienne. How I can be, when I controlled drug. Despite the evidence. My story. Cops. My own father. I can not believe that I have made it. Not against her. No one else can see it. I call that damn pain. Anthony... - I do not deserve it. - Begin to deserve it. See it as a start to the new you. You have reached the end of memory, Tom. What will you do now? We are waiting here. Repeat reminded, until he shows up. - How long have I been here? - Two weeks. You see me. You see me, right? Do you remember me? Tom Jacobs. - Minnie, do you see this? - Yes, Tom. Talk to me! I know you can hear me! - What did you say? - Enough. - What? What did you say? - I said enough! What the hell is wrong with you? Anthony? Anthony! Anthony! What will you do now, Tom? We continue to wait. Welcome back. - Can you hear me? - Yes. Yes. Good. Very fine. It is important that you understand everything, I say. I've been a prisoner here in over four years. My wife called Abby. I remember her last number. Will you let me go, so call her. Tell xx where I am. She will not believe you. This is what you should say to her. If something goes wrong, so just think of this place, I'm here. Abby. Abby? Abby? - Is everything all right? - I was far away in my thoughts. Now, do not misunderstand this. But this is our third date. Yes... We may have to cut it? No! I just had a hard day. Can you forgive me? You know what? We change today. I'll check my schedule, and then I'll call you. - Okay? - It's great. Hello. - Is Abby Jacobs? - Who am I speaking with? My name is Anthony Willis. Can I help you with something? I have spoken to your husband. Madman. Are you kidding? I can call the police. Your father had a stroke and died when you was 23 Tom was your guy back then. You would not want your father in a coffin and ran down to the beach. Tom came, and you asked him to go, but he would not. I talked until the sun went down. Two o'clock at night he proposed to you. You said he had world's worst timing. And why would he be a fool? He said that he took, what he could get, just it was you. Even the smallest portion would be enough. I saw the whole conversation. I can see everything you do, through your short-term memory. She believed you. This means that she come here. There is more, you have to say to her. I think I know what went wrong, and how to fix it. I know everything about you. You played football as a child. You're named after your uncle. You began to take drugs, when you were 14th Seen your best and worst sides. I have seen your crimes. But repentance. Here is your chance to to do the right thing. Will you help me? Do you think I want you in the head? I want to believe you. You may have got it all to know in a different way. I have a question. If you can talk with him, you can reply. What do you know? His nickname for me. - You have five minutes, ma'am. - Thank you. Are you there? I can not just talk to him. We have a place where we meet. He looks enough now and give me the answer. - Can he see this? - He sees everything I see. This is his daughter, Donna. - Take me to the venue. - Locates. - Can you see him or not? - Not yet. - I do not know what I'm doing here. - Wait. - You've made me laugh. - Give me a minute! Birdie! He calls you Birdie. I can live in the memory forever. Okay, write this down. Am I here, is a chip in your body. I think it was damaged, as self-destruction failed. - But I looked after. - A part is back, said Tom. - Why I saw nothing? - Reader spores metals. Prototype had kiselchips. The new was mono Christian tallin silica. Stressed did, that I got reprogrammed reader. It had taken a few minutes. - It's not your fault. - What do we do now? - I was allowed to move Tom. - But what about Anthony? - This is Richard. - Richard? He still has contacts in prison. Hey. Hi, Abby, it's Richard. I just talked to them. They will not allow it. - It did not. - Is everything so that the end? - I could not, I said. - I'm not. I send you his contact information. - Mr. Kennison? - You must press him. No one will fight like you. I will pursue you. Well, I have a ranch there. I guess I can transfer him, let him stay there- - few guards who do not speak. If I got the right motivation. What does that mean? Machine, Mrs. Jacobs. They may well assign rights to me? I understand that it can be a difficult decision. So you know nothing about me. Fix it. I have to be honest. It's hard to know that you might follow. Promise me to keep quiet about a lot. It is the lonely in the cell and then. I do not want that people judge me. Yes. You... I hate this place. We can probably choose somewhere else. - Come on, you pivskid. - Nobody's stopping you. Do you want to sit and do nothing? I may sit and look at you. Okay. Last chance. Come on, your pivskid! I with you. It was you long od. Lovely place. A place we went to on weekends. I think we had been together for four months here. Have you been here before? Hard to say. I no longer know what memories is your or mine. This is my. This is a... ... Better place. Do you remember the last time we met? You told that it would not hurt. It has hurt every day. Why did you build the machine? I do not know anymore. I thought I wanted to help people. Visit the past and processing your trauma. Make the world better. A clich, right? So I forgot about it. It began to act more on what I got out of it. Do you regret it? Every day. You can not change the past. It may your next invention. I would buy a ticket. I travel in the night. - They move me from here. - Without further ado? Where the hell are you going? They will save me a place before the procedure. They say that it is painless. Computers and machines before most of the work. I sleep a night, and then I moved. Trying him something, listen we will. So what? I come to another institution. - Wonderful. - He needs help. I warned you then. - I would prove my innocence. - Your innocence. When you called, you told me everything. I remember it, if you do not. There has been something terrible. I had to pick you up. See my son with an overdose in the back seat while I took care of all. I said nothing, for your sake. It went well for you. Now you know not where they take you. - I will not take drugs again. - Forget that. A chance in a bad prison, then you are at it again. I'm trying to do something good! You have not done anything good throughout your life. Now you're angry, right? I am a bad father because I do not believe you. I have saved you 100 times. But enough is enough. You hate me maybe, but everything what I have done was for your sake. - Do you think you're innocent? - Yes. Then prove it! Damn. He was right. What is that? What I will build. Each chip has a frequency. It will send a signal and receive frequency. Once we have found Tom signal Do you tell which remind him in. Tell him to stay there. We filter it through the console. Loading Toms body, making prey. - Does it work? - I do not know. - It's our best chance. - How long? We begin in an hour. The process should take four hours. Actually... It may take a little longer. - What do you think? - I need me. So I will ask Tom about anything. He looks well here. Tom, I have helped you much, right? I want something. I want to know what happened. I saw it. You killed your boyfriend. Another thing as cops blew on. I want to prove them wrong. - We do not have time for this. - So dispose time! I want to know that he listens, and agreeing to it. So Tom... I am waiting to hear your answer. You lied. Will you keep me? You killed her. I'm not a murderer. Why her? Well, she did it over. You were high, so you were perhaps angry. - Can not see everything? - Actions, not feelings. Good! You do not know what she meant to me! You can not fool me. I have seen you take drugs. Set you threaten people. Everybody's skeleton in the closet? You only know my story, not me. I know me. What you? Him, I talk to, or him with the needle in the arm? Cops, your father and I, all think you did it. Are we all wrong? Is the evidence wrong? You did it, Anthony. So what's the point? The point is that something else happened that night- - something with another man. I want to know who. - Chasing memories are useless. - I will guide you through it. Even if there were any, was you, you shot. Not by accident, not in self-defense. - Player details so any role? - Yes, for me. Did you think you would get your freedom free? I thought you were decent. Everybody makes mistakes. I am guinea pig for people like you- - but now I decide. I am your only chance. You have until tomorrow morning. Do you want help, so help me first. Abby, who has come a little delay. No worrying. - Is Tom there? - Yes, he came an hour ago. Good. I'll call you, when it is in control. Okay. So we begin. Share Adrienne. All you remember. We were together for two years. She was not very easy. Family Issues suicide as 16-year-old. I got her on harder drugs. First we were amused just. So she was... everything to me. Then I would stop, because we killed each other. But she could not. I tried everything, but I could not help her. One day she got just without saying why. Did not answer the phone. I ended up in a downward spiral. The next time I saw her, she was dead. I have found a signal. Now we are waiting on you two. It should go fast. You said that something else happened that night. Tell everything you remember. Minnie, Prepare to locate. I remember I woke up in the bathtub. There was a burst. I had a bottle of pills and Adriennes gun. Head ached. I do not know how long I had been away. Place is unknown. I remember pictures on the bookcase. In the guest room there was a sofa with TV - on the shelf, an alarm clock. I heard a sound. Turned me. Blackout. Did not even have to pull my gun. Minnie, find attacker. Placeholders. Placeholders everywhere. Only 5% true. No context. - You do not remember who or where. - But memory is real? - Yes. - So you have to keep looking. Meet me there. - Look again. - For the fourth time? All are placeholders, also magazines. I'm not the man. We have nothing. What should I do? - I said nothing about the magazines. - So what? You remember them, but not what. But now I remember, it was porn. I would have seen it. You mix it with something else. Do I? - Where exactly is the photo, Minnie? - 100% Mnemonics. You learn it in the studio. One remembers nothing on a meal- - but I tell about the meat, remember potatoes. It takes just a start. This is not enough. You must tell me about your thoughts. We need to work together. Remain here now and focus. I will tell everything I see, and you say something you remember. It's all there. I remind you just about it. The first is... It was not a porn magazine. It was a tattoo magazine. Also the other. Yes. Well! Something else can be seen now. A purple bottle? A lot of perfume bottles at the sink. Good, good! What color was the mat? - Red or orange. - Red. Towels are rdsorte. - And the picture? - A train. Shower curtain was the first thing I saw. It had a strange pattern. Stains. The entire bathroom was stylish, and all the colors matched. You remember it. Let's see what else. - Say when rates change. - Commemorative 25% true. Photos in the hall... One is a drawing. Soldiers. - An entire room here now. - Pink blanket on the couch. Pictures. A hat. Coffee table with a book. There is a wall. - A bookshelf. The TV is on. - Cartoons. Clock shows all possible. What time is it? Come on! What time is it? Minnie, reset the memory. Now, if you remember all the little things... ... I know that you remember the big one. - What was he doing with her? - I do not know. And 1:35 is the time power driver thought she was dead. - Maybe he did it. - I saw you. You may be wrong! I helped you, help me now. Tell Garrett that I wait at our venue. A promise is a promise. I have to pee. Can I have one? Shit! Throw the gun! Throw it! Give me the keys! Think! They will chase you! Door you, you kill Tom! Come on, Anthony. Where are you? I come! Damn! - When did you get out? - Right now. Come on, damn it. It is a thousand years ago last! Do you want a little pick-me? I give. Very funny. You were in Adriennes house. I have no idea what you're talking about. Damn! Say that you were not in her sister's house when she died. - Look who remember it. - Why did you kill her? - You are crazy. - Do not lie! I killed her! I was there, but I did not do anything. She was already dead. I heard footsteps and saved me. And then you. With a gun. I panicked and hit you. They interrogated me. You said nothing. What would I have done? - What were you doing in her house? - What do you think? She would never be with you. Jas? Why do you look so shocked? You got her on drugs. She came to me because of you. What, did you? Well, we had some sort of agreement. I got drugs for her. She gave me what I needed. What a sense of guilt. Why she did it over with you. She so wanted tell you. But do you know what I think? I think you took to her house that night. And was high and brittle. I think she told you everything. And you shot her. I'm sorry. Hello! Give me the gun. All this because of a girl. I thought we were friends. What do we do now? - Call the police. - No cops here. Yes. He has the right. What the hell? Listen. If it helps you, would she like to stop. Really. The problem was... I was depending on her. I said that if she completed our event... ... I would shoot her. So thanks for that you did the dirty work. Damn! Minnie, locate everything that is happening now. - Minnie? - I'm Minnie. What do you want? I said locate everything, happening now. Locates. Experimental Facility injured. Why did you do it? I was so close. I was there. System Crash. Talk to me, you coward! Look at me! You must get me away. There is something wrong with Minnie. You promised. What will you do now? Look at me! What do you do now? I do what is best for me. - Your prototype works well? - Yes. I can not return. Your wife can do it here. Explain how to do. We'll fix it now. OPENING extraction - Ready. Now what? - He waits for me, he said. Get him out of my signal. Can you see him? - I lost him. - What do you think? Anthony? I can not see him. Where are you? - What am I doing here, Minnie? - I do not understand. Filters... Filter no! I have a memory. - Are you sure? - Anthony? Stay awake. I need a memory. Now! What would you do, Tom? Damn... - His daughter, Donna. - Could stay there forever. I know where he is going. You have arrived. Come on, Tom. Hello! Get out not! Welcome, Tom. What will you do? Anthony! Look at me! What should I do? Come on, Tom. Tell me what to do! It was time. Goodbye, Tom. - Takes you now? - Do you have a time to care? Last chance. My name is Tom Jacobs. Born 2 November 1972. My parents called Mark and Judith. My wife called Abby. I would do anything to hear her voice. Tom? Tom? My father fought in the war. He did not believe in psychology. Or post-traumatic stress. He said, that life is like a beach. You come home with a little sand. He was 15 that day. Rex. I remember the dog very clearly. A show dog, as I got. Was Rex show dog? What are you talking about? He crapped all over the house. Chewing on furniture. - You sound like my youth. - What are you talking about? Another coach offered me a good price for it. I said that it was unruly, when he was in school. If you say something often enough, think a child on it. Dog was unruly. Anthony so. I saw it. Anthony did not see a damn thing. Rex was a really good dog. Are you sure you remember correctly? Are you? - I'll take a beer. What about you? - No, thank you. - Dad, what should I do? - Repeat what I said Anthony. Say something often enough, so think a child on it. I've said 100 times, that the dog is too stupid. Brainwashing is difficult. I have a solution. What is brainwashing? Hypnosis, cult programming. Can it really be defined? Maybe it's not obvious. Perhaps Anthony just conditioned to believe that it was stupid. Good boy. There are many ways manipulate on. Just a father talking to his son. Was he convinced that so what more? - Cops told me. - Look what you did! - His father's disappointment. - Does my word nothing? - What more could he have believed? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was an anonymous tip on his car on a bridge - close to the scene around noon. 02.00. You were the anonymous tip. - You wrote the letter, right? - What the hell are you talking about? Do not make the numbers with me. You got him in the swing. What do you know? - It does not matter now. - Well, I do. Anthony called you the night. What did he say? He snvlede incoherent. It sounded like another lie. Abusers always lies. How could you? - Protected yourself? - I protected him! It was a matter of time before he was found dead in an alley. When he woke and could not remember anything- - I decided. I slew him. I was clean when I was released. Do you have children? - Yes. - What would you have done? Guilt is a powerful. The forces, it becomes an obsession. You have a choice. You can take it to the... ... Or change. In her case, she could not do neither. What if he convinces people, it works? - I do not know why I let you go. - Out of habit, perhaps? I understand. Sounded good? Sometimes you need to hear a familiar voice.
