He'll take care of it. But doctor... I'm in the middle of a surgery, nurse. I'll get there as soon as I can. Yes, doctor. Where was I? That's him. Come on. Come on! Stop making things difficult. Let me go! Get me out of here! Let me go. Let me out of here. Scream all you want. No one can hear you. Kids. Let me out of here! Zula. Are we there yet? Yeah, Megan, we're here. Smart ass. Where is everyone? Shouldn't they be here by now? As far as I know. Megan? Oh, look, there's Dale. Hey, Dale. Welcome to Tearlon. Not bad. Yeah, they're still in the process of remodeling, but the whole interior's brand new. - Hey, Megan. - Hey. You get a look around? Uh, no, still trying to get to my room. It gets more beautiful every time I come up here. If you'll excuse me, Rita, we should probably show these two to their room. Our room? Yeah. Come on. Okay. Come on in. So everyone else called dibs. You two are the last ones here. So you're going to have to share. Hope there aren't any objections. Cute double beds. Yeah. Great. So? I'm okay with it if you are. It works for me. Well, you two are the only ones not to complain. It seems our little group has a talent for finding flaws in a free trip. Don't worry, Dale. I'm sure we'll think of something. All right. I'll be downstairs if you need anything. - Thanks, Dale. - Sure. Wow. Look at that view. Oh, shit. - Hey! - - Jesus, Tedi. Jesus? Where? - Did you see him? - - See who? - The kid. - - What kid? The little kid. What? I didn't see any kid. I saw Joel. Who the fuck is Joel? Joel is lira's special delivery from her douche of the month club. Wait, what? Lira brought some guy. She brought her boyfriend? Yeah, if you want to call him that. But I thought this trip was just for our department. Yeah, I thought so too, but I guess she found a loophole. Which was? She just showed up with him. And if I'd known you could do that, I would have brought myself a little something to poke on. Tedi. Come on. It could happen. Fyi, you've got to share a wall with them, so I hope you weren't planning on getting any sleep this weekend. Are you kidding me? No. Oh, what's this is I hear about you and, uh, forest sharing a room? It's no big deal. It's not like we're in the same bed or anything. Yeah, not with that attitude you're not. We're just friends. Oh, so then it's cool if we switch rooms, right? You touch her and I'll kill you. Don't move. She can't see us if we don't move. Hey, Zac. What's up, fellas? What was that all about? Shut up, Tedi. Zac, I'll see you at dinner. Who was that? No one. I can't get a signal. You know the first rule of vacationing. Leave everything behind. I know. But this isn't a vacation, Zac. It's a retreat. All right, smart ass. Attention please.. See? Back to work. Could I get everyone's attention down in the living room, please? You guys seen Tedi? He's in the bathroom. Probably beating off. Nope. I tugged one out before we left. I am good. All right. Looks like everyone's here. I just wanted to let you guys know you need to be extra careful, okay? Especially if you wander out in the woods at night. The caretaker said there's a lot of bears around this time of year. Wouldn't look really good on my review if one of you come back dead or with a huge bite out of your ass. Don't even think about it. All right? Tonight's fair game, guys. Okay. Have fun, whatever, but let's not forget why we're up here. We have our first meeting tomorrow. Yeah, why are we here? Ah, good question. Uh, we're up here because it's a simultaneous pat on the back and kick in the pants, to be honest. The head honchos love what we're doing, okay? That's why we're here. But they're worried that our shareholders are going to get a little bit antsy and jump ship if our little growth stock doesn't somehow exceed next quarter's forecast. Rita? We'd like to start by getting everyone together to help inspire team unity. Oh, and they want to pick our brains to see if we can figure out ways to increase productivity. Of course, with the same amount of resources, which is always nice. It's only a couple of meetings, people, okay? You pretty much have the rest of the weekend to do whatever you want. Like get eaten by bears? Rawr. Fine, if it makes you happy. Okay? If there aren't any other smart Aleck remarks, does anyone have any questions or comments? Yeah. What if we see a ghost? Meigan, ghosts aren't real. Thank you. Uh, what about the holy ghost? That's not the same thing. But you believe in Jesus, right? Of course. Well, isn't that kind of like believing in Santa Claus, but not the Easter bunny? Tedi, you don't believe in Christ? Um, no, but I do believe in the antichrist. How come? Because she works in marketing. Okay. Knock it off. Knock it off. Let's not start a holy war. See what you started? At some point during the weekend I expect each of to thank Rita, for talking to Penny Pinchers into even letting us come up here. Thank you so much, Rita. Thank you, Rita. Yeah, thanks, Rita. You're the best. Meigan, if I could offer a piece of advice? Shoot. Don't worry about dead. Fear the living, especially with this group. All righty. I'll bear that in mind. Hey, Dale, can I talk to you for a sec? Sure, Zach. What's up? Who was that old man with Rita? That was Earl ray, the caretaker. He greeted us when we got here. Is he staying here? No, he said he has a cabin nearby somewhere. Really? Yeah. Only living soul around for miles. Okay, thanks. No problem. Good meeting. Ugh. Nature sucks. Oh, come on. I kind of like it here. I'm probably going to get, like, a million mosquito bites. Can you blame them? What the hell are we going to do up here for three days? Well, there's a hot tub on the porch. Um, you trying to get me into a bikini? No, trying to get you out of one. The blue one or the black? Hmm, I don't know. I'm going to have to see them on. Alright. Well? I don't know. Turn around. It's kind of revealing, don't you think? That's the point. Don't worry I have a wrap to keep Tedi from checking out my ass. Let me see the other one. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm dead serious. Fine. Happy? And then some. Mm, what do you think you're doing? You wanted to go in the hot tub. Changed my mind. Too bad. I'm ready. Put your fucking suit on. All right, already. See you later. Oh. What's up, player? Good morning. I thought iTunes was against your religion. No. The lord loves music. Oh. So what do you got on that? Like, motorhead or? Book of psalms. Oh, seriously? Um-hum. I find it very inspiring when I go for a nature hike. All right then. Carry on. Peace be with you, Tedi. You too, kiddo. What's up, dude? Morning. Looks like someone got some ass last night. That's kind of a personal matter, don't you think? Not if you have ears, it's not. Hey, you ever play that game ass, Cooter, mouth? Ass, Cooter, mouth, uh, no. I can't say that I have. How do you play? Well, you give me a number one through three, and I try and guess which hole you stuck it in last night. What if I say all three? What if I say high five? Smack. Not necessarily in that order though. You're all right, man. You're a fucking douchebag. Heard that. Good morning, lira. I said, good morning, lira. Good morning, Tedi. Hey, you know that expression, 'that girl's got spunk'? Yeah. Well, when they say it about you I think they mean it quite literally. It's called toothpaste, dipshit. You should try it. Yeah, I will. I do that after I have my coffee. That way I get that clean mouth feeling all day. Do you know where they keep the toothpicks? Yeah. Joel's got one between his legs. Right? Hey, buddy. Can I kill him, Dale, please? Not unless you find me a new programmer. Tedi's kind of like that fat guy in Jurassic park. We loose him and all hell breaks loose. Yeah. If it wasn't for me, you'd be up to your dick sucker in dinosaurs. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm making omelets. Who wants one? No thanks. Oh, god, Dale. No. What's wrong with my omelets. They're made with love. Whoa. What happened to you? What? What? Psalm 23, the lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his namesake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table for me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runeth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I shall dwell in the house of the lord forever. All right. Who's missing? Not me. Anybody seen Rita? Uh, yeah. She went for a jog this morning. Did she say where she was going? Fuck if I know. She probably went to find Jesus or something. Should we wait for her? Uh, no. We've covered most of this already. I'll just fill her in when she gets back. Yeah. Let's get this party started, huh? Let's get down to business. I'd like to start off by saying thank you to all of you for the past quarter's extra work. I really appreciate all your effort. You're welcome. Okay. My design team, you're going to be happy to know, your prayers are finally being answered. You're transferring Tedi? Oh, forest, you break my heart. Oh, we still love you, Tedi, just from far away. Like a fine work of art. Yeah, something like that. I'm upgrading your workstations with the new Imacs. Retina display, flash drives, the whole deal. Yes. I thought you'd like that. What about storage? Um, I'll have to look into it, but storage is cheap. It shouldn't be a problem getting it authorized. Hey, uh, what about loosening up Websense? I mean, it's not like I can't hack through that shit if I wanted to. You know I could. I just... why waste my time, you know? You only want them to take down Websense, so you can look at porn. Whoa, it is not my fault the server crashes every time I try and download your sex tape. You're going to die. Lira. Children, could you come back to the table? All of a sudden came the thunder of hooves rushing up the path. A dark figure in a black cloak rode it's horse toward the porch. The old man walked down the front stairs. And the cloaked figure stopped his horse just outside the pool of light that was being cast by the lanterns hung above the porch. The old man staggered back. Shot twice, once in the neck and the other in his chest. The dark figure rose up onto his horse and fled down the Lane disappearing into the night. Friends rushed to the old man's aid, but it was already too late. The first shot had bored a quarter sized hole. Now's your chance. To a chamber... What the hell are you talking about? Chicks get super turned on when they're scared. Like you would know. Trust me. Both times I scored the chick was either drunk or scared. I think one of the times she was both. Alright. Hey, hey, Zac? Just in case. Thanks, Tedi. Do you guys mind? No. Sorry. It was just getting really good, Dale. Please continue. Thanks. Now as I was saying, so much blood poured from the old man's wounds that a thick pool formed underneath his head. He coughed once. And then again, the second being a hideous gurgling sound as though two invisible hands were choking the old man to death, squeezing the very life out of him. The sound sent a shiver up the spines of everyone who heard the old man's last dying breath. Hey. Dale's ghost story getting to you? Oh yeah. I'm going to have nightmares for weeks. Here. I brought you some Pinot. Trying to get me liquored up? Maybe. Is it working? Maybe. This is really good. Compliments of Mr. sau. You know, I was a little taken back by him joining us on our little retreat here, but, um, now I'm starting to think it might have its benefits. Having a rich boyfriend does have its advantages. Are you sure? I wouldn't know. I'm a 'two buck Chuck' type of girl. You okay? Yeah. I'm all right. No. There's something wrong. I see it in your eyes. Oh. You can read my eyes now, can you? Yeah. I can. I bet you can't even tell me what color they are. Well? They are brown. I know. I'm just messing with you. And you stole that from AXL rose. How do you know he didn't steal that from me? Because you're not that sensitive. I am sensitive, dammit. As if AXL rose is Mr. sensitivity. Hey, I'm sure he's a nice guy once you get to know him. That's like saying he's an asshole, but you'll get to used to it. No it's not. He once threw a girl down a flight of stairs. Well, I'm sure he had good reason to. Yeah, he did. Because she wouldn't sleep with him. That will do it. That is not funny. That is... Why, why are you laughing? I am not laughing. I see that. Damn you, Zac. Why do you always have this messed up way of making me feel better? I don't know how you do it. Are you going to tell me what's wrong? Rita's not back yet. Are you sure? I thought she was just avoiding Dale's tale of the occult in there. I'm pretty sure, Zac. She's been gone all day. Have you told Dale? No. I didn't want to spoil his fun. A whole hell of a lot of fun. Should we go back in? If we have to. From that day on the servants couldn't keep the porch clean. Every few weeks a damp pool of blood would appear in the same spot where the old man had died. They tried repainting the porch several times, but the blood stain would always bleed through. One night one of the servants saw something that caused him to go mad. Folks said that the house was haunted by the angry spirit of the old man. The house was sold several times, but each time the residents were driven out by the horrible gasping breaths of the old man's ghost and the hideous blood stain that could never be removed. The house was eventually abandoned until just last year. One year ago today, in fact. When it was completely remodeled and turned into Tearlon lodge. You're so full of it, Dale. I had you going. I don't know. I thought the story was pretty good. Up until the end because I think I heard that one before. Yeah? Good one, d, although I think you've got to give partial credit to Joel. The wine definitely helped. Yeah, it's something else. You have any more? Yeah. I got a whole case of it. I'll go get you some some more. Let him get it himself. Don't be a bitch, babe. Excuse me? He said don't be a bitch, bitch. Did you want any more? - Sure. - Okay. Dale? Hey. You missed my finale. I'm sure you didn't disappoint. Yeah, but every great storyteller saves his best for last. I'm worried about Rita. She hasn't come back yet and she's been gone all day. Did you try her cell? No, I can't get a signal. Yeah, me either. Has anybody seen Rita? Yeah, I did. She got eaten by a bear. Tedi. Can you be serious for one fucking minute? No. Which one's Rita again? She's a dark hair, skinny chick, huge bug in her ass. Oh, yeah. I remember her. Yo, money bags, pass the hammer. Thank you. I really think we should look for her. Wait a second. She comes up here all the time. She might have just gone to visit with the caretaker. Well, is there any way we can contact him? I don't think he even has a phone. I kind of get the impression he prefers to live off the grid. Well, what if Zac and I go and look for her? No. I can't have you two traipsing off in the middle of the night. You could get lost, or fall in a bear trap, or god knows what else. If she's not back by the morning we'll go look for her. - Okay? - Alright. That goes for everybody. Even Joel? Yes, even Joel. With that, I'm going to get some sleep. This wine's done a number on me. I need to hit the hay. Try to keep it down to a dull roar. Good night, Dale. Night, bud. Goodnight. Night. Good night. I'm glad you liked the wine. Well, can I refreshen your glass, your majesty? Please. Whoa, that's good. Thank you. You're welcome. Here, babe. Seriously, Joel, enough. You're no good to me when you're like this. Oh, come on. It's better when you're drunk. Not for me it's not. Whoa. Tough woman to please, huh? Buddy, you ain't kidding. I'm going to my room. Are you coming? Joel, the heart wants what the heart wants. Not you, mongoloid. I'll be up in a minute, babe. Yeah. Fuck you. I'd get up there if I were you. The longer you wait. The bitchier she gets. Too much to drink, Tedi boy. All right. Well, on that note. All right. I'll see you guys later. Adios, amigos and, uh, feel free to drink the rest of the wine. - Thank you. - It's all yours. Good night. No. Wait, oh god. I'm going to join you. Oh, oh. I got you. I got you, big boy. Okay. There we go. Up the stairs. Hey, do you and lira have any plans tonight? Yeah. I'm going to bury my sword so deep in that stone-cold bitch, the first person who pulls it out's going to get declared the king of England. Brothers. What are you two jibber jabbering about? Just, just guy talk. Got you, buddy. Careful. Someone's going to break their neck on those things. Yeah, watch out. Tedi, isn't your room downstairs? I thought we were going to tag team like the Hardy boys? No three way for you tonight, bud. Sorry. I wouldn't be so sure about that. He's got two hands. Lira makes a joke. Tops. All right. Well, about time for you to be hitting the old dusty trail, right? Yeah. I'm going to go. Good choice. You, uh, slay that fire-breathing cocksucker. Bye. Are you, you okay? Yeah. Hey, Zac. Looking good. I think everyone's going to get some action tonight. Good night, Tedi. Please. Good night. Go. Fine. But long live the king of Arthur. Long live the... long live king Arthur. Long live the king. He is nuts. Fucking loon. You know you worry too much. You're probably right. There's no probably to it. I'm always right. How could I forget? It happens. Um, you gonna come upstairs? Not yet. I'm going to wait here for a while. See if Rita straggles in. All right. Don't stay up all night. I won't. Good night, Zac. Good night, Meigan. Rita? Rita? Are you in here? Rita? What was that? Shut up, Joel. Yeah. It was probably nothing. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I fucking hate you! Tessa, calm down. Shut up! Shut up! Leave me alone! You know what happens if you don't calm down, right? We'll have to sedate you. I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you. Hey. Jeez. Relax. It's just me. What are you trying to do? Scare me to death? Scare you? You're the one creeping around in the fucking attic. I thought Hugo had gotten loose. I was halfway down to the bait shop to pick up a bucket of fish heads. Sorry. Hey, are you going to come to bed? Think the fuck-a-thon next door is over, so you and I actually might get some sleep. Finally, some good news. What the hell are you doing in the attic anyway? I don't know. All right, weirdo. Come on. Okay. Kill her. She lies. Who? Who? Hey. You all right, Zac? Yeah. You sure? Uh huh. Is Meigan in there with you? No. She's not into you, you know. Excuse me? I know you've got this huge crush on her. It's totally obvious. But she's not over her ex. Girls just kind of a sixth sense about this sort of thing. You know, I'll bet she even tried to call him while she was up here. Maybe. I don't know about you, but that sure as hell would bug the shit out of me. Being all alone at night next to the one you ache for. Being so close, yet so far. I bet that's got you all pent up. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? What about your boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. But we can sport fuck at best. You'd still be cheating on Joel. You know, I never really liked the term cheating. Makes it sound like I'm playing some sort of game. Aren't you? What? Playing a game. If I win the game, do I get a prize? Have you seen the Excedrin? Get your fucking hands off of me! You okay? I don't want to talk about it. Meigan, please calm down. Well, she still isn't back yet, Dale. It's time someone worry. Hey, I wasn't disagreeing with you, okay? Just don't get all panicky. We'll find her. It's been 24 hours. Obviously something's wrong. Rita never came back? No. We have to go look for her. Where's Tedi? Tedi? Tedi? Stop yelling, Dale. I'm right here. Okay. There you are. Get your shoes on. You've got to come with me and find the caretaker. Let's see if maybe seen Rita around. I'm in no condition to go for a hike. Get your shoes on now or spend the rest of the trip prying my foot out of your ass. Aye aye, captain. Zac, I need you to check around the lake for me. You got it, boss. Lira, I want you to check the local hiking trails. There's a map in my room. You can use that. You want to go tramping through the woods? Yes, I do. And take Joel with you. You'll cover more ground that way. All right. Fuck. Bitch. Meigan, I need you to stay here just in case she comes back. I'm not staying here. I want to help you guys. I know you do. That's why I want you here, okay? If she's hurt or needs anything, or something happens to us, I need someone here I can count on. Okay? You want me to leave that to lira, or Tedi? Guess not. And keep your phone on just in the off chance you get a signal. - Okay. - Okay. Tedi, let's go. I'm coming. No, not... move it, now, buddy. Good luck. What? What was that back there? With what? With that guy, Zac. Fucking Christ, Joel, not now. Oh, what? You going to have a conniption fit or something? Or something. What's your problem? What was that back there? We were just talking. Bull shit. - Joel. - I saw you. What are you saying? You know what I'm saying. He tried to kiss me. He came out onto the porch. He looked like something was wrong. So I went over to see if he was okay. And one thing led to another. I guess he took that as me coming onto him or something. And it's not the first time it's happened either. He does this all the time at work. It's disgusting. Why don't you tell Dale? I did the first time it happened. It's just my word against his. And Dale likes him. Everybody in the office does. Including you? What the hell kind of a person do you think I am? There's something seriously wrong with that guy. He's on all kinds of medication. He literally scares me. I just didn't want to because any trouble or anything. Don't you trust me? I don't feel safe around him. Hey, I'm sorry. Okay? No. Don't touch me. Why don't you be a man and do something about it instead of tearing me down with your bullshit accusations? Rita? Ricola? Bad joke, Tedi. Rita? Rita? Jesus? Worth a shot, right? You looking for birds? Bingo. Come on. Hey, I'm hungry, Dale. Yeah. We'll eat later. Should probably knock first. Why? The door's open. Anybody home? Earl ray? I don't think he's home. Door's locked. Why would the door be locked if no one was here? Rita? You in there? Rita? If anybody's in there, can you open up? We're missing one of our group. We need help. She can't hear us. I'm breaking it down. Easy, Tedi. This isn't our house. You can't just go breaking people's doors down. She's probably bound and gagged. There's blood and shit all over the place. We can't just leave her in there. We don't even know she's here. Rita? Quit fucking around. Just find this Earl ray guy. It's probably just a big misunderstanding. "Investigators baffled by brutal crime at a private" psychiatric hospital in the mountains near Tearlon lake a female patient age nine, whose name cannot be disclosed was allegedly attacked and brutally mutilated by a male patient of the same age. According to the police report most of the girl's tongue had been cut out with a pair of surgical scissors. Registered sex offender Earl ray Warren, who had been working as an orderly at the Tearlon lake psychiatric hospital was brought in for questioning after investigators discovered shocking evidence of torture, deprivation, and child abuse. Renowned psychiatrist Dr. Herman Rexif has resigned as head physician of the hospital and has refused to answer any questions. "No charges have been filed at this time." "Earl ray Warren was released from police custody" yesterday after the conclusion of the month-long investigation. Authorities could not produce any evidence of wrongdoing, although Warren, age 46, admitted to many bizarre and cruel methods of negative reinforcement in the care and treatment of children, including a chamber known only as the box, a tiny metal cell where children were placed in isolation sometimes for days at a time. "It was done only on the direct orders of the trained medical staff." So what'd you do today? Colored. Is this what you drew? You drew this? Yes. It's very good. Thank you. Is this your family? Yeah. Why are they on the ground? They're dead. How did they die? I don't know. Are you lying to me, Ned? I never lie. Then how did they die? God punished them. Why? He hates liars. Did you color anything else? No. The other kids came in, so we went back to our room. So you weren't coloring alone. I'm never alone. Who was with you? The one the others are afraid of. Does he have a name? I can't tell you. Why? He'll hurt me. Like he hurt Sarah? Not like that. I don't know what he'll do. Did you see Sarah today? Yeah. She came into my room. What for? To wish me a happy birthday. I didn't realize it was your birthday. Happy birthday, Ned. Thank you. Did she say anything else? She said my mommy was downstairs with presents and a birthday cake. Well, would she say that? Nobody came to see you today. She lies. How long has it been since you saw your parents? A long time ago. 17 months since... I don't want to talk about this. Why not? It makes him angry. Dale, I really had a feeling about that room. I think we should've gone in. We need more than a feeling, Tedi, all right? Anything? Nothing. No sign of her. I was hoping she was back here. Did you find the caretaker? No. We found his cabin, but nobody was home. It was strange. Didn't you say his name was Warren? Yeah. Earl ray Warren? Yeah, why? - I think you need to see this. - Later. We just came back to see if she'd come back here. With her family connections, if anything happens to her, I might as well kiss this job goodbye. We're going to split up until we find her. Or the old man. Okay. Well, be careful. It could be dangerous. You, too. Fuck. God dammit, Zac. You've got to stop doing that to me. Doing what? Scaring the shit out of me. You just backed into me. Any word on Rita? No. I was going to ask you the same thing. Where the hell could should be? I don't know, Zac, but I'm really starting to worry. I think the caretaker might be a child molester. What? I found this article and the guy's a sex offender. Did, did you tell Dale? No. I, I tried to, but he's gone back to keep looking. That's not even the worst of it. Look at this. Where did you get this? In the attic. This place used to be some kind of mental hospital. Guess that explains why they got the place so cheap. It's not funny. The authorities shut this place down. They were torturing children. Fucking kids, Zac. Yeah, I get it. Young people. I... it's terrible. Are you okay? No. I wasn't going to tell you this, but I've been seeing some pretty weird stuff around here myself. What? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't think that you'd believe me. As soon as Rita gets back we're getting the hell out of here. There's something not right about this place. Great. I'm going to go back out and see if I can't find her. Be safe. I will. Here, um, take this just in case that pervert comes back, or wherever. I want you to be safe. Thanks. Please come back in one piece? I will. Please extend me the same courtesy. I'll be back. Jesus. Hey, Joel. Did they find Rita? I'm not looking for Rita. What? I'm looking for you. What the fuck? What the hell is your problem? You're my fucking problem. You stay the fuck away from her. I didn't touch her. She's the one that kissed me. You calling my girl a liar? No, Joel. I'm not. I'm calling her a slut. And a liar. You fucker. It's not worth it, man. Joel, stop. Joel, stop! Help! Help! Rita? Mr. Warren? Come on, guys. I fucking hate hiking. Rita? Rita? Mr. Warren? Oh, shit. What the fuck? You guys? Hello? Dale? Anyone down here? Someone there? Hello? You're in a lot of trouble. I didn't do anything. Yes, you did. Please don't put me back in the box. I didn't do it. I tried to stop him, but he doesn't listen. I couldn't make him stop. Just tell me what happened. Ned? Ned? No. No what? Ned's not here right now. Then where is he? That's not important. I see. Then can you tell me what happened to Sarah? I don't think so. Can't or won't? What the hell? Hey, Maigen? Who are you? Tell me. It's not important. Oh, I think it is. I don't care what you think. Then may I speak with Ned? Is he still here? You're speaking with me now. Hello? Anybody down here? Okay. So tell me what happened. You know what happened. But do you? Of course I do. So it was you. Who else could it be? Ned? Ned wouldn't hurt a fly. He's too much of a sissy. Is somebody down here? Rita, is that you? You took something from her. Uh huh. What did you take? You know what it was. Why would you do that? Liars must be punished. What do you do with it? Rita? With what? Rita? Her tongue. Oh god. Up you go. Come on. What the fuck? Come on. Come on. What the hell happened to her? Come on. Dude, she needs help. Yeah, no shit, Zac. She's going to fucking bleed to death. Well, um, I'll start a fire. What? You heat metal, cauterize the wound. We don't have time for that shit. Well, I'm not a fucking doctor, Zac. Where's Dale? I don't know. He's probably still looking for Rita. Fuck. Um, speaking of Rita, I found her. Where? In the basement. She's dead. Dead? Are you sure? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Fuck, she's getting blood all over the place. Just go and find Dale and I'll stay here with her. I don't know where Dale is. I... Just fucking go find him! Go! Fine! Come on. What did you do with it? With what? Her tongue. It's in the box. Nurses already looked in there. Not that box. My box. Music box. Shit. Where's Tedi? How the hell should I know? He just went out looking for you. What happened to her? What? We got to get her to a hospital. I'm on it. I'm on it. Fuck. Give her to me. Where's everyone else? They went out looking for Rita. Fuck. Dale, there's something I got to tell you. If I don't leave right now, she's going to fucking bleed to death. You find everyone else. You get to a signal. And you fucking call me. Ned? Ned? Twinkle, twinkle in their eyes cut out tongues that tell me lies. Ned? Why do you keep calling me that? That's your name. Everyone calls you Ned. I hate that name. You're the one Ned warned me about, aren't you? The one he tried to stop? Ned can't stop me. But he does know what you did to Sarah. Everyone knows that. And he's afraid of you. They're all afraid of me. So why don't you tell me who you are? Or at least who you think you are? Why do you want to know? It's my job to know what's going on inside that head of yours. I guess you could call it curiosity. Ask the cat what curiosity can do. Hello? Anybody? Hey, Zac? Zac? Hey, Zac? Tedi! You. Where is she? Who? Don't play games with me, boy. She's got to be here. Are you talking about Rita? Where is she? She's here. Is she okay? No. She's not. Son of a bitch. I know who you are. I know what you do. You just stay back. Stay back! Tell me, grandpa, did she scream when you fucked her? I never touched her. Pretty little thing like that? I'm sure you wanted to. Never touched her. Is it because you loved her? Or because she wasn't a boy? How dare you. Zac? What do you think about that, huh? How you like it, you son of a bitch. Huh? See how you like it. Are you okay? I'm sure glad I gave you that knife. Can you stand? Yeah. - No, no. Don't look. - Oh god. Don't look. Tedi. It's okay. It's okay. Let's get out of here. Oh shit. What? I don't have the keys. My wallet, clothes, everything, it's inside. I'll go in. I'll be quick. Zac. Here. Where the hell did you get that? It doesn't matter. I just want you to take it. I need to know that you're safe. No. A gun, Zac. Please, you take it. Just get the keys and get the fuck out. I'll be okay. I'll be right back. Did you forget something? Yeah. I did. Be careful. I will. I'll be right back. Hello? Anybody home? Rita, wait. Is he dead? You don't understand. What don't I understand? You don't understand what he is. I don't know my own grandfather? What did you do to him? Pap pap, are you okay? Stay back! Maigen, no. Let go, Rita. Son of a bitch. You didn't really think you'd get away with it, did you? Tell me who you are. You didn't say please. Perhaps you'd like to think it over in the box? I'm waiting. Zachary. Zachary. Come in. Hi, I believe you were looking for this. Yes. Set it on my desk. Take the patient back to his room. Yes, sir. And see to it he doesn't get in any more trouble. Understand? You can count on me. You don't have to do that. If you didn't want my help, Ned, you shouldn't have asked for it. He's still alive, you know. Not for long. Such a naughty little boy. And you know what happens to naughty little boys here, right? Yeah. I'll see you again real soon. And you better not scream. You don't want to get in trouble again, do you? Such a good boy. Stop being so difficult. Scream all you want. Nobody will hear you. No! Oh god! Son of a bitch. Dale? Zac, I'm at the hospital. Yeah, lira's going to make it. She's getting a transfusion now. But she lost a lot of blood. But she got lucky. Believe me, I, I know. They're at the hospital. Lira, she's going to make it. Is that Maigen with you? Yeah, it is. Hey, Dale. Who else is with you? It's just us. What do you mean? I mean it's just us. There isn't anybody else. Please tell me you're joking. He's not joking, Dale. We wouldn't even have got out ourselves if it wasn't for Maigen. God. Do you want us to come to the hospital? Dale? No. Uh, get your butts home. I should check on lira. Hey, wait. By any chance did lira say who did this to her? No. She, uh, she said it was dark. She didn't really remember anything, it was the old man. Mr. Warren. All right. All right. Uh, just let me take care of things. You get some rest. I'll call the police and get this whole thing squared away. Okay, Dale. You take care. You too, Zac. You brought that awful thing with you? Yeah, I did. Why? I don't know. Used to have one as a kid. I guess you can call it me being sentimental. Oh my god. Oh my god. What? Zac. What? Rita's still out there. We can't just leave her there. Maigen, um, Tedi found Rita. Well, where is she then? Where is she? Dale! Is anybody here? Shh. I guess you can say that she's in a better place. I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't been there today. Don't stick your tongue out at me.
