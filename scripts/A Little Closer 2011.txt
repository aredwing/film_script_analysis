Setting up these speakers my friend Mike gave me. - Can I help? - No. - C'mon please? - No! - Why not? - Because. - Just fuck off and leave me alone! - Mom! What? What are you doing? - Can I please help you? - Quit fucking hitting me! - Please? - No! - Mom! - Alright, fine. - What do you need me to do? - Help me lift the TV up. Why do we need to move the TV? Because I have to get in there and drill a hole in the back. It's heavy! What do we do now? Help me lift this. Alright, now pass me the drill. - No I want to drill. - Give me the fucking drill. - I want to drill. - Give me the drill, alright? - No - Quit fucking around, give me the drill! No! - Gimme... - Mom! Alright. - In the middle, right here. - Okay. It's not working... Oh my god. Are you sure you're doing it right? - Just push it through! - I'm trying! - Give me the fucking drill. - Okay. Just give it to me, stop screwing around. Fuck, it's in reverse. Ow, my eye! I didn't mean to! Are you ok? I didn't mean to, it's okay. - What hap- Marc! Jesus! - I was setting up these speakers and drilling a hole - and he was right there... - Okay, lets go, lets go! I don't know what you were thinking. It wasn't even my fault, I don't understand why you blame - everything on me. - Then whose fault is it? - It wasn't mine! I was setting up these speakers- You don't give an eleven year-old a power tool! I was setting up these speakers that I got, and he wanted to help, - and he kept bothering me- - Thanks for the speakers by the way, great thinking- - You're welcome! I mean the place is a fucking shit hole and I was just trying to- - Do not call our place a shit hole! - It's a fucking shit hole! Don't smile! I'm working my ass off! Well work harder. Oh, this is funny? You need to grow up. Hello, Stephen. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. You are very lucky. His eye was scratched pretty good. He's got a lacerated cornea. Luckily, the drill barely touched his eye. Now, the scar will be there forever, but it's nothing that won't hear it on it's own. Ok? - So... are we going to be seeing a lot of you? Well, yes. Are we going to have all these repeat treatments for this, cornea, or... He'll have to come in a few times for check-ups, and even after the patch comes off we'll want to monitor the scar, just to make sure things are healing properly. It's quite normal. Stephen, can you go outside for a bit? Okay. I was... I just... I'm wondering, if you have any idea how much this is going to cost me? Yeah I got this scheme to get the girls... I go where they all, ya know, flock together... and then I break out my violin and I play something real romantic Really? If you don't got someone to fuck you got to go looking - for one, ya know? - Mm-hm. Ever been to one of those those uh- "Social Nights" over at the community center, have you? Uh no, I don't know about those. Well, maybe you're a little too young for that. It's mostly older girls, like divorcees and widows and shit... Mhmm. - Yeah it's a total trip. - I bet. When I was your age, I had a girl. What was her name? Her name was Crystal. She'd fuck me any way I wanted. Whenever I wanted. Yeah. How's your eye feel? Fine. Can you see alright? Yeah. What do you have going on at school? It's summer school, no one cares. It's stupid. Well I have to work every day, and Marc's working all summer, so you're not staying here watching TV every day. Everyone's going to laugh at my eye patch. You want me to call them? - I don't want you to call. I can deal with it. What's your teachers name? Ms. Moss. Number three? They can propose laws. Right, they can propose laws. So not only do they have the right to do away with a law, they also have the right to suggest a law. Okay. Who can give me three responsibilities of the Judicial Branch? Yes. They have control over the Supreme Court? That's right. Control over Supreme Court. Anyone else? - Stephen, how about you -Huh? What did I just say? Stephen, can you come to the front please? Thank you, now, I want you to do me and your classmates a favor- I want you to tell everyone what happened to your eye, so they can stop wondering and start paying attention. I was helping my brother and I hurt it. Ok, and how did you hurt it? A drill. I'm sorry? A drill went into my eye. Thank you. Have a seat. Okay. Hey Sheryl, how's it going? Hi, I'm just about done, sorry. No worries, take your time. We actually thought we were going to be here earlier but we're a little late. Sorry about that. - That's alright. - Cheque for you?

Have you ever looked at one of these before? Have you ever looked at one of these before? No. Here. So damn hot out here, man. Why are you guys in summer school? Didn't read the books. My- my- my mom just put me in here- Shut the fuck up. Hey! You cannot be on this roof! Get over here! The rest of you have until the count of three to get over here. Stephen! You could get in a lot of trouble for this! I know. I'm sorry. Nice eye patch. Thanks. You look like a pirate, kind of. Thanks, I know. What's it like? What do you mean? Well, do you only see half of everything? I pretty much see everything. So what do you think of this place? It's really cool. Yeah it's pretty neat. So, you got a boyfriend? No. Why not? Don't want one. Well, you think maybe I could be your boyfriend? No. Why not? I don't know... I've never had a boyfriend before. Well I've had a few girlfriends. What did you guys do together? You know, just hung out at school, went to the movies, nothing too big. Will everyone know? Well, I guess. Is that bad? No, but, my parents wouldn't like it. Well we could just keep it a secret for now. So you want me to be your girlfriend? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Cop hold? Huh? Oh fuck! One! Two! Three! Hi, how are you doing? Doing alright, how are you? I'm fine, good. I'm just getting ready to leave, actually- Oh, damn, I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks. You have a good night. Thanks, maybe I'll see you again next time. You fuckin' her yet? Uh, no not yet, but I mean, we're moving pretty fast. No you haven't, I can tell. You want her to put out, you gotta give her something nice. Like jewelry or some shit. Why do you say that? Girls are suckers for that. You give her some jewelry, she'll put out, trust me. Am I doing it right? Yeah, yeah, you're fine. Is something wrong? No. I can tell that something's wrong. Nothing's wrong. Do you want to do something else? No, you're fine. Do you want me to do something else? Well I mean, just, ya know, an idea- Yeah, go ahead- Could you use your mouth? I've never- It's just an idea, you don't have to. Do you want me to? Do you really want me to do that? Yeah of course. Would it feel good for you? Yeah, definitely. Okay well, you have to tell me when. Because I don't want to taste it. Of course. Do you promise me? Yeah I promise, of course. Do you pinky-promise me? Pinky-promise. Okay. Look at that car!

You can't do any better! Nice throw, you weakling! Come on guys, watch this! What the fuck you doing? Whatcha gonna do about it? What should I write? What should he write? "Fag" Write "fag", Stephen! Yeah! I bet he can't even spell "fag"! That's what he is! He can't spell his name! Hey, you know what a blow-job is? It's when a girl puts it in her mouth. What does it feel like? Pretty good. My girlfriend does it whenever I want. You have a girlfriend? Don't tell Mom. Why not? Don't fucking tell her! I think I love you. You love me? Yeah. Are you in love with me? Yeah, is that bad? I'm just not ready yet. What do you mean you're not ready? I can't. Well, when are you going to be ready? If you love me then there's no rush. People who love each other have sex. That's what happens. I'm just not ready. Well when are you going to be ready? I'm getting tired of waiting. I just want you so bad, is that wrong? No. Well then I don't see what the problem is. I heard it hurts. It doesn't hurt. For girls it does. No it doesn't, it feels great! How would you know? I just do. Will you just please tell me when you're going to be ready? I don't know. Mom? Yeah? Can I have some money? What do you need money for? I don't know, I could just really use some. Well, you have a job, you could use that money. Yeah, well I could have enough if I waited all summer but, I need it now. Well, you should know, as an adult if you... spend money you don't have, it puts you in a bad situation. Please can I just have the money and I'll pay you back as soon as I get it from my work? How much do you need? Maybe, two hundred? What the hell do you need two hundred dollars for? I want to get something for my girlfriend. Well I don't have two hundred dollars. So I can't give you anything I don't have... You can save the money, then buy whatever it is this thing you want with your own money. Mom? Yeah? Can I have some money too? No one's getting any money! But I need some... Okay, shut up! Eat your food. Okay, seven basic principles of the Constitution, can anyone name one? - Yes. - Freedom of speech? Freedom of speech, yes, but what principle does that fall under? Individual rights? That's right, individual rights. Can someone name another one? There's one in particular that I'm looking for- yes? Separation of power? There you go, separation of power. The reason I was looking for this one is because we just covered this the other day. Who can give me a third basic principle? Stephen, can you stay for a minute, please? Can you come over here? Everyone else, don't forget your homework for tomorrow. Okay, first of all, you're not in trouble. But I just wanted to talk to you for a second, because I've noticed that you've been drifting in class and you seem a little distracted, is there something on your mind? No. Is everything ok? Yeah. You're sure... Yeah. Okay, well how are things at home? Fine. That's good, what about your mom and dad, do you guys get along- I don't have a dad. Well what about your brother?

Look, Stephen, I just want you to know that if you ever have any questions or you feel like you need to talk to someone, you can come to me, okay? Okay. Yeah? What are you doing? Using the bathroom. Well, I'm going to go pick up dinner. Okay. That bitch is pissing me off. She's always yelling at me about slacking off and everything- Wait, Stephen, didn't she like, make you stay after school? Yeah, why? Why, dude? Got some nice pictures in here. We should get her back somehow... some shit. Maybe we could break into her house when she's not there- Nah man, shit on her car- Pee in her garden! You guys really shouldn't get back at her, you guys are gonna get caught... Because we're the only ones in the class that hate her- Shut up, Stephen! - Everybody hates her! - If we plan it right we won't! What, are you sticking up for her? Nah I ain't sticking up for her- Then why don't you wanna go with it? You guys think I can shoot this behind my back? Who gives a shit? - Hey. - Hey. - What's up? - Nothing - So what are you doing today? - Working. Oh, well, you think you could come over? Now? Yeah, just take a lunch break or something.
