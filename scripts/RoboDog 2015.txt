So, my Mom and Dad started calling him Dog too Dog's been around since as long as I can remember. We love doing everything together. He also likes to play fetch, chase cars, dig holes in the yard: oh, and he can do some pretty cool tricks. I've heard that dogs are man's best friend. Well, Dog is not only my best friend. He is the greatest friend I could ever have and nothing can in the world ever replace him Happy Birthday to the Greatest dog in the world. Aw, man. I spelled Birthday wrong.

Coming. - There you are. Did you find it? - Yes. - Great. - Did you put the ladder away? - Yup. Way to go son, we're off. What'ya working on? - Can you keep a secret? - No. It's a high end power source that continually charges itself using kinetic energy Oh. Basically, it's a recharging super battery. Oh, yeah. I... I knew that. Hey I've been working on solar powered scissors. Oh? Yeah. So, instead of using your hands, they'repowered by the sun? Well, uh, you still need your hands, but... you know the motor helps you. Gotcha! - Hey, what's this? - Hey! That is a robot. And, if my calculations are correct, once install the self-charging super battery... like so. It should never run out of power. Never? - In theory. - Okay. Let's give it a go. Brandish your safety goggles. Oh... That's pretty bright. - That's pretty bright. - Yes. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Tom! - Is it supposed to do that? - Okay. No! - Do something Tom! - Would you give me my arm back. Think I'm gonna stick to my scissors. Jiminy jumper nuts. It'd work perfectly if it would stop making stuff blow up. Mr. Willis. Get back to work. - Well, if it isn't... - Tom Austin. - Yes, Tom, how are you? - I'm, I'm great Mr. Willis, what brings you down here? Well, I'm just doing my monthly check in to see what all my money's paying for. - Do you have anything good? - Solar powered scissors. - What? - Barry Melch. - Yes I know Belch. - Melch. - What are you yapping about? - I just wanted to show you these. Solar powered scissors. Solar powered scissors? Seriously Belch? It's called Epic Industries, not as seen on TV Industries. - Well, I think if you'd... - Get back to work. Go clean something... - that's what lab assistants do, isn't it? - Yes sir. So, what do you have for me, Tom? And don't tell me a solar powered spatula. Sir... Stop that. I told you to stop. It's creepy. It's nothing like that sir. - Actually, what it is... - He's working on a... - Self charging super battery. - Belch! Is Belch, right? Self charging super battery? Actually, that is correct sir. Brilliant! I knew you were a genius! Hiring you was the best decision I made for this company. Now, is it done? Almost, there's just a few minor over heating issues. Great! I have an investor from Japan that's coming on Monday I'm gonna bring him by for a demonstration. - Monday? - Don't mess this up. I'll see you on Monday. Jiminy jumper nuts. Monday. Hey guys! Hey, Bill! How you doing? Great. Hey, Tyler. Hey, Chloe. Getting ready for Dog's big party tonight? Yes, sir, Mr. Johnson. Hey, Tyler, you. You wanna put this stuff away, - and let dog out - Sure - So you guys stopping buy tonight? - Of course we are. We're excited. You know who else is excited? - Who? - Dog. He was really barking up a storm earlier today. Really? Strange. See you later. Ready for your party dog? Here boy. Dog, you ready for your birthday part... Dog. Mom! - Hi - Hey. Honey, it's awful. - How is he? - He's up in the crawlspace, I tried to get him down, but, it's like a hundred degrees in there. Okay. I'll get him. Tyler? Ah, buddy. Tyler. Tyler, I know it hurts, buddy. Come down stairs, let's talk about it, okay? He came up here for squeeks I don't know what happened. I closed the steps, I promise. I know you did son. I... closed the steps. I promise you. Tyler, you have to understand. That this is just an accident. It's a horrible accident, but it's not your fault. Can't leave dog here. I'm gonna take care of him for you. Come here, Come on. Jeez. I am so sorry. Come on. Come on buddy. Come on big guy. Oh no! Sweetheart! - Sweetheart, I over-slept! - What? I overslept! My presentation's today. It's eight twenty seven? What happened? Dog. Usually wakes us up! Where's my... - I guess we need to start setting an alarm. - Yeah. - Wish me luck. - I love you honey, good luck. Hey, that's my purse. Thank you. You gonna be fine. Jiminy jumper nuts! So did ya get it working? Does it look like it's working, Barry? It's still over-heating. - Donut? - Thanks. - I didn't eat breakfast this morning. - Oh, you shouldn't do that. It's the most important donut of the day. Yeah, I didn't sleep much last night. Our family dog passed away this weekend. That's so sad, how long did you have it? - Eleven years. - I had a pet goldfish once I accidentally flushed it down the toilet. Luckily, my parents got a new one so I wouldn't notice until right now. That's a strange story, Barry. I'm gonna get back to work now. - Thanks, for the donut. - Hey, no problem. I just have to this - a couple more times before Mr. Willis... - Tom! Mr. Willis you're early. Yes, I just couldn't wait to show off my main man to my main man from Japan. This is Mr. Sato. Hello. Bon jour. So. Show us something. May I speak to you in private for just one second? I'm not quite sure that it's ready. Not sure it's ready? Or it isn't ready? Those are two very different things. - Very different. - Right. I just think that maybe we could do a few more tests before we demonstrate. Well, you had plenty of time to run your tests over the weekend. - Jerome, how time is that? - Three days. Three days, that's plenty of time. I understand Mr. Willis. And this is not a valid excuse, However. My family dog died on Friday. Alright, that's enough. I understand. You do? Yes, I understand that you want me to look like a fool in front of my business colleagues. And if there's one thing I hate: - it's being made to look like a fool. - Hates it! Jerome, could you please go over and stand with Belch? Yes sir. The last I want to do is make you look like a fool. The last thing you want to do is to not succeed. So, is ready? In theory Then in theory you still have a job. Turn it on. Yes sir. Sorry Mr. Sato, just a little pep talk. Okay, gentlemen: What you are about to see is a power source that has the energy of twenty five car batteries With the ability to recharge it-self just by the nature of it's own motion. Please: brand-your safety goggles. Here goes nothing. I give you the super battery. Is it a... Is it working? Yeah. Yeah, actually, I think it is. I'm gonna give it some more juice. Whoa! Tom! You're a genius. Do you see that? Yes! Crank it up. Okay. - We're at thirty five percent, now. - Okay, crank it up more. Mr. Willis I think we should play it safe for now. Do I pay you to think? Epic Industries needs epic results. I'll save you Mr.Willis. Stop, drop and... Do something! Sorry, about that guys. I told you it could use a few more tests But all things considering, I think it was... pretty success... ful? That one epic hairdo. Get out! Get out! Am I fired? You are the most fired person in the history of people get-ting fired! I never want to see you again. I'll just get my stuff. No! I will have it sent to you! Now get out of here before I call security. Bye Tom. Bye, Barry - Mr. Sato, I am so sorry. - If I could just get my phone. Get me security. Wanna take a look at my solar powered scissors? Tom? - Oh... Hi! - Hi! You're home kinda early? Yes... funny story. - Did you get fired? - Yes! I got fired! And it doesn't sound as funny when I say it out loud. I'm sorry babe. Are you okay? Yeah. I mean my boss was being epic-ly ridiculous. So... Now I can work on my world changing inventions right here from home. And I can help you with the house-work. Oh, we'll be fine. I'm doing really well at the office right now. That's important. I'm gonna get dinner ready! No! Nope, I've already taken care of it. - You have? - Yes. - Is that the smoke detector? - Dinner's ready. So, anything exciting at school today? Tyler? Earth to Tyler? Huh? Your dad just asked you a question, how was school today? Oh, uh, yeah. It... it.. it was fine. Ah. Nice. May I be excused, please? Sure, honey. Let me know if get hungry later, okay? Hey? Hey. You all right? I guess. You know, if you're ready and only if you're ready. We could go and look for a new dog this week. New dog? I don't ever want a new dog! Nothing will ever replace him, I miss him so much. I know buddy we all do. I want him back. Please, can I have him back? That is the one thing, Tyler, I wish I could do. - But, I can't. - It hurts so much! Well, come here. Nothing wrong with letting it out okay? Let me see. You know I've been there too. And it's tough, but you can get through it. Hey, you feel a little better? Okay. Come on, let's go to bed. Ow! That, is not a bad idea Mr. Austin. Where's dad? He's in the garage. Darling... I've come for your toaster. What is he working on? I don't know. As long as he's not cooking. I heard that. And, I may or may not have used portions of your bicycle. What? Mom! He just... Dad! Hey, Dad? You okay in there? Hey, Tyler? Is your mother out there? - I'm right here - Oh, hi honey! Wait right here because boy have I got a surprise for you. Hey! - Hi! - Hi! What's goin on here? What's going on with the car? - I needed some parts. - What for? All will be answered momentarily. Let me present to you my latest and greatest invention... The RK-9 What is it? R stands for Robot, k9 stands for dog. You get it? It's a robotic dog. Check this out Nice invention Dad. Well, I'm having some Power source issues. But... with a robot this advanced, it takes a lot of power. I think it's great, Honey I'm gonna um... I'm I'm gonna let you clean up your creation and I'm gonna go into the house and fix dinner. - I could cook dinner. - No. Please. Yes, dear. Somethin' wrong with your car? Barry? You want me to take a look at it? I took an online class once. Didn't pass. Oh, no... no... that's... that's fine. What are you doing here Barry? Well, Mr. Willis wanted me to box up all your stuff and... deliver it to you. So, uh, here you go. Oh, thank you. Wait a minute. You got the battery back? Yeah, I also brought some uh... staplers and your.. No, Barry, you don't understand this is the answer to all my problems. Oh, yeah? What is it that you're workin on here? It's my latest invention. A robotic dog. Oh, yeah! Doesn't do all that much. Well, you should have seen it about an hour ago. Cuz it was working perfectly I've just had some power issues but... this is the answer to all my problems Before you electrocute me again. Oh, but I do want to give you this. It's a gift. Uh, it's my solar powered scissors. I figured you could use them. Barry, I mean honestly, thank you so much. No sweat. And, good luck with your Robo Dog. Yeah... Robo Dog. ROBO-DOG Now, what I need to do is reflect back the heat of the output and take that energy back the main processor but, how am I going to do that? Unless I have a... solar panel? Barry... you may be... a genius. Temperature is steady. Power refueling... I think I did it. Oh, yeah! I did it! Grandma's mink? Sorry Grandma. I miss you buddy. Dog, dog it's you! I love you! I love you, too Tyler. Do ya like him? What? Are you okay? DOG! - Not technical - Hello, Miranda. What did you do? Family, may I introduce you. Robo-dog. Robo-dog? - Robo-dog? - I am Robo-Dog Uh, how did you this? Honey. Well, it was actually rather easy once I figured out how to harness the incredible energy from the super battery without burning the house down Why, does he look like Dog? Because, you said that you wanted him back. And I don't know if you know this but bringing a dog back to life is virtually impossible. Unless, your old man builds you a robotic version. He's got some of the personality traits of Dog, yet he doesn't eat, he doesn't sleep, he doesn't chew on things, and Ma he doesn't poop or pee in the house! - I like that, that's good. - I thought you might like that. Isn't he the coolest? I am the coolest. I guess. Well... I'm gonna let you two get acquainted. Good Champ. You too Tyler. - Get some sleep, honey. - Yeah. Tyler. You know he's doing this to cheer you up. I know but it's just weird... Yeah, well sweetie, just make effort. I mean, who knows? You guys may end up being the best of friends. - That would be swell. - I... seriously doubt it. - Goodnight honey. - Goodnight mom. - I love you. - Love you. - I love you, too Miranda. - Okay maybe this is a little weird. Just to let you know... I don't care what they say. We will never be friends... ever. Why won't we be friends? Well, number one... You won't stop staring at me. Why don't you blink? What is blink? Blink. This is blink. Like this? Yeah. What is number two? Number two is that you aren't a real dog. That is correct. - You don't even act like a real dog. - You can teach me. Why? Why not? Because. - Because, why? - Because it's weird. Tyler, I do not want to be weird. I would really like to be more a real dog. Please assist. Maybe. We can talk about it tomorrow. I'm tired. I don't wanna think. - What is that? - They are my eyes. - Are they flashlights? - Affirmative. Why do you have flashlights in your eyes? I use them to illuminate the night. Can you shut them off please? Real dogs don't have flashlights in their eye. - Sorry. - Okay. Thanks. Good night. Good night, Tyler. So, how's it going with your new friend? Mom, I told you, he's not my friend. Excuse me. What are you guys doing today? Well, I'm teaching him how to be a dog. Today's lesson is how to stay. Watch this. Robo-Dog, Stay. - Wow! - Isn't that cool? He won't move at all until I say. Come on. Now, watch this. Robo-dog up. Now, stay. Isn't that funny? Betcha he'll stay that way all day. Tyler, if you're not going to be nice to him, you can do something productive, like, clean your room. Okay I'll play with him. Perfect, after you clean your room. Okay. C'mon. Can I help? I don't know, can you clean all this for me? Affirmative. Cool. Vacuuming the rug Vacuuming the rug. Do do do do doo. TYLER? What're you doing? Playing video games. I asked you to clean your room not Robo-dog. What's the difference. Well, the difference is is that your Dad made you a dog, not a maid that you can use to clean your room Then why did he install a vacuum in his butt? I have no idea what goes on inside your father's head sometimes. - Hey. I just got to level fifty. - I really don't care. Because what I need you to do right now is take Robo-dog outside and teach him how to be a real dog like you promised. - Let's go! - Fine. C'mon Robo-Dumb It's Robo-Dog. It's Robo-Dog. Okay. First things first. Let's see what you know. Sit! Pretty good. Something, still isn't right. Oh, I know do this. Why? - Real dogs do that all the time. - Like this? Right. Now, lie down. Good. Now, let's do something a little bit harder. Shake. - Whoa! What was that? - It is my fifth arm. What other gadgets do you have hidden in there? I have over 42 different techniques and upgrades. Including night vision, Heat sensors Rosetta stone, a vacuum, and GPS. Okay, I got it. SBack to dog stuff. This is a ball. We use this to play fetch. So, when I throw it, you're supposed to run after it and bring it back to me. Why? Cuz, that's what dogs do. I guess. - So, are you ready? - Affirmative. Like that? What are you doing? You're supposed to run after it and give it back to me. Why? Because, it's fun. Now, let's try that again." Well, that was a a little fast, but it's a start. Now, you are being ridiculous. What? You're to keep fetching it over and over. I thought you said this was fun? Forget it. Let's try something else. Oh, I know! Okay take one side. With your mouth. Now what? You have to try to get it out of my hand. See? You can't get it out... RO BO DOG That was fun. Again, again! NO... No thank you. I think we need to do something that's a little more safe... for me. Like what? Hey, I... I know You can chase cars. Why? You want to be more like a real dog, right? - Affirmative. - There's a car right now. Go! What the heck's goin' on for crying out loud. Robo-dog put the car down. That was fun! C'mon, I know a place we can go. What is this place? It's a dog park. It's where you learn to become a dog. What do I do? One thing you can't do is talk. So, I guess just go around and watch the other real dogs. See what they do. What is he doing? Sniffing your butt. Why? Actually, I don't know. A bunch of dogs do that because, I guess that's a way to get to know you. Wow. Looks like a lot of dogs want to get to know you. Awkward. Not as awkward as someone hearing you talk! Sorry. Go fetch! I got it! Great! One small step for dog kind. Wow, it's getting late. We should get home. I think I'm getting the hang of this! Initiating GPS. Continue straight for 30 and turn left I know where I'm going. - In 295 feet, turn left. - Okay, that's really annoying. In 290 turn left - It's Chloe! - Who is Chloe? - She's a girl I like. - Have you sniffed her butt yet? - No. - Do you want to sniff her butt? - No! That's gross. - But... - Just, please be quiet. - Hey, Tyler. Hi! Chloe! Oh, did you get a new dog? Uh... sort of. It looks just like dog. - What's his name? - Robo-dog. No, really, what's his name? Robo-dog. He's a robot dog my dad made for me. That's... cool. - You don't believe me? - No... Here watch. Say something Robo-dog? - That's a cute trick. - It's not a trick. Sure. So, what are you doing now? Just headin home. Oh, is it okay if I walk with you? Sure. - I mean, sure. - Okay. - Thanks for walking me home. - No problem. So, what're you doing tomorrow? Just teaching a new dog old tricks. Well, I'm going downtown, maybe I'll see you and Robo-dog there. Uh... Sure. Okay. See ya! Here that, boy? Chloe just asked us to hang out with her tomorrow. Chloe just asked me on a date! That's so great. She asked me on a date. She asked me on on a date. She asked me on a date. Don't look at me like I'm weird, you're the robot dog. Hey! You look happy! Did you guys have a good day? It was okay. And, what about you, Robo-dog? Did you have a good day? What wrong with his audio? I don't know. He stopped talking for no reason. That's weird. Okay. Bark. This is really odd. There's no reason for him to be silent. Everything seems to be in order. I don't know what else to do to make him unmute. Stop barking!! I don't understand why would he need to bark that loud? I didn't mean for him to bark that loud, sweetheart I just happened to find some car speakers up in the attic. Okay. Watch your ears. Robo-dog. I command the to bark! Ow. So, Robo-dog what did you guys do today? Today, Tyler taught me how to be like a dog. He did? And how did he do that? Robo-dog show dad that you like him. Jiminy Jumpernuts Tyler, you tell him to stop that right now - Okay, cut it out Robo-dog. - Did I do something wrong? Robo-dog, that's not how you show affection to humans. How do they? Like this... - Shake. - Oh! Yes. Affirmative See what I've I've had to deal with? Oh come on, we can work with that. Let's see what else? Robo-Dog, ummmm - Like my face - You want me to lick your face? Yeah, that's how dogs show their masters that they love them. - Affirmative. - Okay, here we go. That was like going down a waterslide a hundred miles an hour with out any water. Leave a mark? - It's just okay, it's not anything. - SNo... its fine... no really. I'm telling you, you're going to love Epic's next big thing. It is simply... Hello? What is it Jerome? The Japanese investor? He just pulled out. He did what? He said his faith in your product is unfavorable. However... He would like to work with you on something like the super battery. The super battery! That would solve everything. Where's Belch? I'm right here, sir. Belch, I need that battery. Oh... I gave it to Tom. What do you mean, you gave it to him? Oh, well, you said to return all his stuff or I'd be fired. So... I don't care what I said. We are on the verge of bankruptcy here. Go and get the battery or your really fired. No problem. Sounds like you guys could use a lozenge. What are you doing? I told you go and get that battery. Oh, you mean now. Okay, you got it. No problem. How have you lived so long without hurting yourself. What do ya mean? I'm okay. I'm okay. Tyler. Hey Dad, watch this. Hey! All right! Come here, let me check his battery. Oh, well would you look at that! No heat emissions. No leakage. Everything seems to be working perfectly. The battery. Wanna get some lunch? - Meeting a friend, downtown. - Oh, a friend, huh? - Need some money? - Oh, no thank you. I got my allowance. Well, why don't you take some money anyway get Chloe an ice cream or something. Who is this Chloe that you speak of? Your mother and I were young once too. There isn't anything that you've gone through that we haven't gone through as well. Except for maybe the robotic dog. But... Have fun on your date, son. - I wouldn't really call it a date. I mean... - Well, whatever you want to call it.. Chip off the old block! Yeah... - Ah, man! The chain's missing. - I believe it is now part of my drive unit. How're we gonna get downtown? Allow me.

Thank you Hey, no more talking while we're in town. We don't want attract any attention. - Hey, Tyler - Hey, Chloe. Hi, Robo-dog. I see he still isn't talking.

Yeah, sure. - Really? - Yeah. Okay Stay Robo-dog. - Is he okay here all by himself? - Yeah, here, watch this. Whoa! How'd you train him to do that? I told you, he's a robot. Okay. Hey, there poochie.

Well, I was out looking for your super battery and Tom, he made this robot dog called Robo-dog... I helped name it. Anyway, he's got super powers like running fast and not moving. The long and the short of it is... he barked off my clothes and I don't have your battery. You're telling me, that Austin made that robotic dog and he's using the super battery to power it? - You got it. - That means he he got it working! And, if he can use the battery to power that robotic dog, we can use it to power even more marvelous things We are talking a power source capable of powering the whole city! And that battery going to be mine! Out! I miss you buddy. Was that a TV show? It was a video I made to show how much I loved Dog. Is this another way to show affection? I guess. Can I watch it again? Sure. My name is Tyler Austin. And this is my dog. His name is dog. Someone's calling you. Who is calling you at this time of night? Mr. Willis. Mr. Willis. - This is Tom. - Tommy boy! Uh... how can I help you at this hour? I'm calling with some good news. I want to pay you a substantial sum of money to come back and work for me. Well... I really appreciate the offer, Mr. Willis but, since you let me go, I've come appreciate how much I didn't like working for you and working on my own personal projects. I understand. So, how about I pay you for some of your personal projects you know, like super battery you were working on. Mr. Willis. You know that the super battery is far from complete I'm sure you've had time to improve upon it. And, I'd like you to sell it to me. I don't understand? What don't you understand? I pay you, you give me the battery. A... you know Mr. Willis... I'm gonna have to turn you down. And... I'm really sorry. You will be sorry. Excuse me? I said, goodnight. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again, real soon. - What was that all about? - He wanted to buy the super battery - that's powering Robo-dog. - Why would he wanna do that? I don't know. - How did it go? - That no good rotton so and so. I'm gonna have to play hard ball with him. Is that anything like baseball? No! It means I'll have to use other ways to get that battery. It seems like the technology would be yours since he worked for you when he made it. What was that? Well, he was working for you when he made it so, - you funded the technology... - Belch, you're a genius. I always thought so. One quick phone call to my lawyer, and that battery's as good as mine! Jerome! This is so awesome! Not as awesome as this! Get ready for the thunder punch! No! I win! Tyler, dinner's ready! Okay mom. Wait did dad cook it? I heard that. And no. All right. Well... looks like I gotta head out. See you later. Excuse me, I would like to show you all a movie I made of Tyler. A what? I made a movie about you using the video content stored in my data base. - I didn't know he could do that. - Neither did I. I made it to show how much I love him. - Would you like to see it? - Yeah, sure. I'd love too. This is Tyler. He is my best friend. Robo-dog, pick a card. He does a lot of fun things. Like - play with me. - No! Don't say it out loud! Robo-dog, catch! Now throw it back, hard as you can! He likes to sing. He really likes to dance. I really think, he likes Chloe. And may one day sniff her butt. Okay! Turn it off! - It is not finished. - I don't care, shut it off. I can't believe you. Tyler is something wrong? - I... I... gotta go. - Okay see ya. Goodnight. - Tyler, what's wrong? - Stupid Robo-dog that's what's wrong. Are you upset with something I've done? Upset? No. I'm furious! You embarrassed me in front of Chloe! Did I? - No, you didn't. It was cute. - Yeah, Tyler she seemed to enjoy it. Enjoy it? She was laughing at me. Why would you show her that stuff anyways? To show her we are great friends. Great friends? No. We are not great friends. You're but a bunch of spare parts my dad took from the garage. Wrapped you up into fur, fooling people into thinking you're a dog. Well, guess what? You're not. You never will be. - So stop trying so hard. - Hey, Tyler... - You're going to hurt his feelings. - Well, he hurt mine. Besides, just a robot... he doesn't have any feelings. Tyler, go to your room right now, I'm serious! Right now. - Fine. - Now. He doesn't mean it, Robo-dog He's upset. Why don't you come inside, okay? Is that Mr. Willis? What's he doing here? I told you on the phone s I'm not interested in selling. Who said anything about selling? I'm taking. I beg your pardon? I have a contract signed by you when you started working for me that anything you did while on my payroll belongs to Epic Industries. So that baby belongs to me! Well, I'm sorry because Robo-dog belongs to my son. And your not taking him. I don't want your son's mangy mutt. I want the battery inside. Can you believe this? So... you can give it to me now, or, I'll sue you for everything you've got and I'll take it anyway! Well, then, I'll see you in court. And for now you can take the contract And get off my driveway! You're gonna be sorry you said that Mr.Austin. Mr. Willis? Please don't hurt my family. Is this what you want? Take it. ROBO-DOG! It is for the best... Robo-dog! Robo-dog. Robo-dog wake up! - Robo-dog! - Sorry about your dog. Nothing personal. Just business. You'll understand someday. Drive, Belch. Hey, Tom. What're you doing here? Barry? I came to say I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for what I did. I feel real bad. Yeah, well... You got a lot nerve showing up here. Just, that, Mr. Willis was yelling and calling me names. And... I just never knew I'd feel so bad about helping him. Yeah, well, I figured as much. You need some help? Not unless you got twenty-five car batteries in your pocket. Well, uh... no... I do have this! Is that what I think it is? I don't know do you think it's the super battery? - Yes, I do! - Oh. Sorry, it's in pieces. Mr. Willis and a scientist took it a part. That's okay. That's okay. Because I can fix this. But, you my friend are forgiven. Well, hey! Let's get to work. - Barry! - Sorry, should not have that. My bad. I... AM... ROBO-DOG! Robo-dog? - Did you fix him? - We fixed him. - Barry brought the battery. - Who's Barry? Hola! Hey, weren't that guy? Who tried to steal Robo-dog a couple days ago? Yeah! You dressed up like a dog catcher! That may have been me. Dad, this guy is bad news. You need to get him out of here. Tyler, Barry has made some mistakes, but he's sorry. And he's our friend. Yeah, I'm a Tyler. I'm... really sorry. Hello, Tyler! Robo-dog! - You're alive! - Not technically Tyler. I am just a bunch of spare parts, like you said before. Yeah, sorry about that. You know what? You're the best bunch of spare parts a boy could ask for, I didn't know that before. I love you, buddy. I love you, too. Tyler. I want to thank you for bringing the battery. No problem. I mean, how did you get it from Mr. Willis? Well, he didn't now that he's got one of his own. What do you mean, he's got one of his own? Yeah, he and that guy from Japan. They made a... gigantic version of your super battery and they're gonna unveil it for town this afternoon. The mayor's gonna be there and everything. - A gigantic version? - Yeah. - Oh no. - What? Oh no, they... there's no way that they would have known to incorporate the solar panels. That the battery could overheat and it could explode. How big is this thing? Oh... I'd say it's about the size of a... bus. A battery that big could blow up half this town. I gotta call Mr. Willis right now. Mr. Willis's phone, Jerome speaking. Jerome, this is Tom Austin. I demand to speak with Mr. Willis, right now. He's a little busy, right now and I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to talk to you. If you don't put him on the I'm gonna tell him that you like to take his clothes and dress up in them when you pick up his dry cleaning. - You wouldn't. - Oh, you bet I would. Mr. Willis. Phone's for you. - Who is it? - Tom Austin. Tom, what can I do for you? Barry told me what you're planning... Belch? Where is that pain in my side? He's stading right here. Really? - Give him the phone. - He wants to talk to you This is Barry. Belch, you're fired. Now, hand the phone back to Tom. Yes sir. This is Tom. Tell me what want, I have an event to run. You cannot go through the unveiling. The battery's too dangerous, you don't understand. What are you talking about? It worked perfectly fine in your robot dog. That's because I altered that battery... Altered it. Industrial sabotage. Industrial sabotage? Let me guess, you want me to pay you to fix it. What? No... You can forget about blackmailing me. I've got my top guys on this project. It is going to be fine. - You don't understand how dangerous... - Goodbye Tom. Yes sir. Make sure security doesn't let Austin or Belch anywhere near the unveiling. Yes sir. - He's going to go through with it. - Oh no. He could hurt a lot of people. We've got to stop him. You in? Of course. - You in? - I don't have a job, anyway. - Robo-dog What about you? - Affirmative. Gentlemen. Let's save the town. It's a beautiful right here out-side Epic Industries for this... Mr. Willis. Mr. Willis! Can you give us a little hint of what this big announcement may be? EPIC! Epic announcement. Okay right. All right, could you please tell us some hint of what this big announcement may be? Well... You'll find out soon enough! Mr. Willis, can you please comment on theatrics... are here to cover up the lack of an Epic announcement. Well, my comment is they're gonna be eating those words because I speculate. I speculate. That this is gonna be the best news that you.. And anyone else here has ever heard. And I'm going to go in and meet the mayor. Big words from an even bigger ego. We'll keep you live right here from Epic Industries. How we gonna get in? I don't know. We need some kind of distraction. - Barry, what are you doing? - I'm making a distraction. - Why is he taking his cloths off? - Because he's a strange man son. - Hey! Look at me! Look at me! - Hey, stop. Who also, happens to be a genius. Let's go. I think they spotted us. Don't worry Dad. You can go we got this You sure? Good luck, Tom. Thanks, son. Was that you? Get over here! Hey! Why're you running away from me? What's your problem? What are you and your little dog doing? Tyler, duck. Whoa! Come on, Robo-dog, Come on. Come pick me up they got me. I'm at the security gate. Where are you going? Ladies and Gentlemen, if you make your way to main stage. Epic Industries main presentation will begin momentarily. Thank you. - Sorry boss. - Get him! Hey, you, kid. Come back here. - I said get back here. - Robo-dog stay! We're gonna get him. Sorry. My back! - Ladies and gentlemen... - C'mon boy, it's starting it is my honor... no... a visionary. Who has single handedly changed the lives of so many including my own. His business charm and savvy are unmatched by anybody I have ever known... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that... that... humbling speech Jerome. - You're welcome sir. - Go sit down. Ladies and gentlemen. When I was a child, I had dreams... much like all you in the audience had had a dream to be something greater than anyone else. I dream to create something that would make people wonder how they ever survived without it. A dream to create something truly Epic. But, today, I don't present to you words of a dream. Today, I present to you a reality. Today, I present to you a technology that truly embodies everything that Epic Industries stands for... the... the... the... - Jerome! - Sorry. The Epic.. SUPER BATTERY! With the Epic Super Battery you don't need to rely on traditional forms of energy ever again. Mr. Mayor Will you have the honor of turning it on please? Yes, of course. Wait!! Don't do it Mr. Mayor. - Well, what's the meaning of this? - Ignore him. He's a disgruntled employee. I fired... a disgruntled employee I fired for stealing. Seriously, Mr. Mayor if you turn that thing on, you risk blowing up half the town. Please, listen to my dad. He created it. He did? I assure you everyone. This is completely safe. It's been checked out by my top scientist. Right... bud? Willis, I don't know this all sounds very dangerous. Perhaps we should postpone until we know it's safe. I already told you it was safe. Watch this! No! See! Isn't it magnificent? Well, maybe he did fix it. Everybody, don't panic. Stay calm. That thing's gonna blow! Panic and run. Grab Robo-dog and get as many people as you can to a safe distance. - What about you? - I'm gonna try and shut this thing down. Be careful. Okay, folks I need all of you to go back to cars. - Shut it off, Willis. - I can't. Well, why not? I don't know how. What about the emergency shut-off switch? Oh, I took out the emergency shut-off to save money! Well that was of you. Why would you do something like that? - Why would I ever need to shut it off? - Maybe for a situation just like this? Look, I don't understand. It worked perfectly in your machine. Why doesn't it work in mine? It's exactly the same. Wait a minute exactly like mine? Well, except for the emergency shut-off. Oh, boy. OH, BOY If we can remove these in time, hopefully we can lower the output rate. Mr. Soto, I assure this is only a minor set back. Mr. Willis, you are a fool! This is not minor setback. This is major castasrophe! I can't get the last two fuses. Hopefully the explosion will be contained! DAD! Robo-dog, help my dad. I'll take care of the people. I'm on it. Look at this! It's beautiful! My greatest invention ever! Mr. Willis, will stop laughing and run. Tom, get out of there! MR. WILLIS!! Dad? Dad? - Dad? Dad? Are you Okay? - Yeah, son. Are okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Where's Robo-dog? Oh no. Son. I'm sorry. It's ok. He sacrificed himself to save you He's definitely a hero. And my friend. Robo-dog! Mr. Willis. Is he dead? Robo-dog give him a zap. Clear. What happened? - Robo-dog saved you, Mr. Willis. - He did? Whoa, so he did. Thanks, Robo-dog Oh, Tom. I owe you and your family an apology I was blinded by fame and money and I forgot I was hurting people on the way. Will you all ever be able to forgive me? Of course we will Mr. Willis. I think I'm gonna be in trouble with the mayor. Yeah, you think you're gonna be in trouble. I'm gonna be in trouble with my wife. Robo-dog - call mom... - Calling mom. You really need to teach me all the things that he can do. So... that was our adventure. After the incident. Mr. Willis had to do some community service for almost blowing up the town But, when it was done he saved Epic Industries with his latest creation. Toy versions of Robo-dog They were a huge hit at Christmas coming in second to the solar powered spatula, invented by our very own, Barry Melch. With the solar powered spatula, you do the cooking right in the spatula!" After word got out about the super battery. My dad was recognized for his work and received top rewards in the field of energy and robotics. As for me, I learned it's okay to open my heart to a new friend. And that friend is Robo-Dog. The greatest robot dog a kid could ask for. Happy Birthday, Robo-Dog! YAY. Great work kid. I especially liked the section about me. It was good. Loved it Tyler! - Okay. You guys ready to eat? - Chloe licked your face? I think she likes you. Yeah, I think you're right. And I owe it all to you. - Oh.. hey... - You're my best friend. Happy Birthday buddy. Thanks, Tyler. Oh, Wanna play catch? Sure come on. Come on, boy
