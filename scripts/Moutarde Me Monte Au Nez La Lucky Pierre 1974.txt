I lost 15 minutes waiting for you! I could see that! Could you write me an article for this evening. It's impossible. You can not do that! - I can not... - You always helped me. At school you were doing my homework... In the army, you took my guard... And since I am a journalist... ...you compose my articles. Do not leave me... - I have to do other things. - No, look at this... I spent the night in the pool to take these pictures. Can you imagine the article? Who cares about a movie star... Not many, except... Mr. Durois. The headmaster wants to see. Yes. I'm coming. I count on you. Good day! Do you live with your parents? Guess who is it! - Daniele. - Won! What? In the name of God! Are you crazy? We're not married! I'll be in the gym during recess. Yes Enter. Professor... Runners, Mr. Durois. Professor Vernier could not finish correcting this. I would ask you to do so in his place. Thank you for your confidence. Do it seriously. Your promotion depends on it. Of course. Are you in charge of the course... ...Sex Education? No sir. So avoid practical work... ...within the establishment. We are almost engaged... You were nearly compromised... ...with your wife to be. Your father would not appreciate it. It will not happen again. ...And give me back these exercises. After you have corrected them. Runners, Mr. Durois. Good day. You may be seated. Let the function F (x) belonging to R + P (x)... ...The study should be made between O and 2 Pi... ...Hence the derivative (UV) = u'v + UV '. Variations box is as follows... (P) = cos2 (E) 2 Everyone understood Is there a comprehensive in the interval (ab)? Of course. I give you 30 minutes to show me... ...the conversion. To your places! Breathing... Tummy in, shoulders down. On your toes, well up... below. Back up... below. On tiptoe, shoulders down... exhale. Head up. May be seated. Few copies remained on my desk, here they are. Be more discreet Mr. Durois. Much more discreet. To work! Go! Quick! Here are the photos. Help me. What are you doing? You crazy! Recess is for fun. But not in the front of my students. Mr. Durois loses his dignity! It's very funny! I can't find funny! Help me. - No. - Just for a movement. The headmaster asked me to be more discreet. We're not married! I do not think we are getting married! What? There will be no marriage. You're not serious! You are too serious. Wait for me... I have to talk to you. Let's change the folders! What are you expecting from me? Free yourself! I want to live... ...with a man who brings me to fantasy!. I will come to teach in pink tuxedo with a clown nose and confetti in the pocket! And I will tell my students that 2 +2 equals 7. and dance to pop music with the headmaster. That's not enough. Is it not enough? But... Daniele! I'm not a clown! Finally, you are funny. So... you kidding? If you were less tense, you would have realized. Professor, they are watching. - See you tonight? - OK He's coming! Do you understand? Establish reverse conversion. Well... Enough! Sit down! Done? - Oh, yes! Well, hurry up! I am expected at the Municipal Theater. Study without me. Daniele, lend me your car! Now? Yes! My father went to work with my copies to correct... ...or maybe Patrick took them instead of the pictures. I don't know... They took away your driver license for 3 months. I'll be careful. Please Daniele. Okay, but be careful. We are convinced that deposited... ...your confidence... ...in the person of Hubert Durois, our mayor... ...who works to return to our city... ...a safety and security... ...well in the historical tradition of our municipality. Mr. Hubert Durois! Friends, never insist enough... ...on the importance... ...of morality in public life and family... ...in this world where buttock is king... ...and where even the queen show... Mr. Patrick Renaudin, please? Mr. Patrick Renaudin. What are they doing here? What about you? I am looking for Patrick Renaudin. - We also. - He wants us on photo session. I told the girls he is not here. He is on the movie set. Didn't he leave here orange folder similar to this? Please! He didn't come around here. He phoned. This is for him. - Do you have a car? - Yes. Why? Take us on the set! I know where it is. It is only 5 minutes away. What. My students? No way! I said no! It's nearly the end of school... Turn right. This is the road to college! Yes, we will go through. - Is there another way? - No. We will see! I can imagine the face of headmaster if he would saw us. With the math teacher! Yes! He would imagine many things. What if we the gym teacher... Enough! Come down! I have an idea. Help! Help! There are two cops in the water. Look, on this side! What happened? They fell when we opened the doors. Present your documents! Fast. Into the car. Fast! Do not go away! It's gonna cost you! Before starting our work, let me explain a little... ...to our friends journalists and photographers. I say right away that this is the plan... more picturesque... ...the more... extraordinary of my film! And perhaps the most difficult... ...and the hardest part... because after I can not do it again. The station you see... It blows up into the air like that... We have ten cameras. With zooms to cut or take... The Indians arrive around the station... They start... To turn around to make the jump. In the station... ...which blows up and nothing is left... ...and over there is our star Jackie... ...who sees the arrival of the Indians and kills with Manchester about 50 of them... Until one will get through with an arrow. Shut up I do not see anything. Take a right, it's a shortcut. Is everybody ready? Darling, are you ready? Anytime, Claudio. Is everybody ready? Then Silence! Silence. Engine! Is the engine on? There is no noise... It turns? On? Ah, yes. I hear it. Action! It's wonderful! What is it? Good! Are you sure it's here? What about that car? Who is this idiot? Indians ride only the horses! Let's go there. Away! I'll stop to ask. Why this idiot entered the movie background? I am looking for Patrick. Go away! He screwed up the scene! Shit! Cretin! Stop! What are you doing? I think we should go. Patrick's car is. Change the tire, I'll be back soon. I don't like him! Cretin! Faster! This is his car! I'll break his neck! Do you want to change now? No, I'll change at home. Find him immediately! I would not to be in his place. If Claudio catches him... Bam! / I What? You forgot to empty the bathtub! We left so quickly... - Good evening, miss. - Thank you. I've been waiting for three hours! I'm tired! I'll open your door! I don't understand. The door opened well this afternoon. The lock is busted probably. It wasn't me. Have some muscles. Well, enough. I still have to do ironing. It smells like burnt pig, right? Brochettes are cooking. Anybody? Is anybody here? Cute kitten, go to the doghouse. To the doghouse, cute kitten. Come Minou. Hallo! Hallo, can I speak to Harry Wessinger, please? This country is utmost importance. At the last meeting with the press it was decided... Mr. Wessinger, it is for you. - Ah, the President! - No, it's Jacky. Jackie?. Ah, excuse me, it's Jackie. Hello Harry. It's Jacky. I said what's the matter / i I was just ringing up to say night, night sugar. But do you realize it's 8 o'clock in the morning! But I've already told you at least hundred times, darling. I am in different time set. Never get it in her head. Hallo. Of course you disturbing me, darling. I am in the middle of an important peace conference It's alright. I'll get the signature before the next proposal. Harry, I'm bored. I'm bored, Harry! Eeee Are you alone? / I Of course I'm alone. Who do you think I'd be with? Another night with sleeping pills. No, don' take any pills. Get yourself something to read. War stories. "War and Peace" for instance. Harry, I've read that books. I've read it a thousand times. Read it again, anyhow / I ...are you still at the conference? / i Harry, I just gonna give you a big kiss. / i I apologize. Get him, Minou! It's a thief! Go Minou! I say one word and you are a food. Do not move, I call the Police. I'm not a thief. So a journalist? No, I teach math. My father is deputy mayor and surgeon. This is because of Patrick, all that. He left with copies of my exercises My father took his copies... I got left with the speech... I don't understood anything. Doesn't matter. Call the police if you like. I saw you recently, right? I drove the yellow car. That was you? You are a real danger to the public! Recently. Turn off please. So... You are a math teacher? A minute! (A + b) 2 is equal to... A2 + 2ab + b2 The derivative of f (y) = sin ax + b... Is? Y = cos (x + b) I can get? Agree, go ahead. But remember, one word and Minou jumps on you!. What word? You want me to say? Just in case, I tell her not to. This is a Greek name. The only one I know is... Niarchos.. This is the other! Onassis? Yes... I'll show my documents. ...You see, Peter Durois. Durois. Professor of Mathematics. You are bleeding! Come. On the one hand, a hysterical director wanted to kill me. On the other, two cops followed me. I hid in your trailer... I wanted to jump and I woke up in your garage. I didn't understand anything... Careful, it'll sting. Thank you very much madam, but I have to go. No, bath first! It's very late. I go to bad late. They're waiting for me... Do you want to talk to Minou? Maria? I changed my mind. Bring me a supper. No, two... And Bernard's suit with a shirt and tie. The plaid suit? Yes, that! I invite you for the supper. It's impossible. I... I want to talk about modern mathematics. But I can not! Ok, I'll stay. First, we wash your hair. But what happened to your hair? In your garage... I dropped something on it. I almost become a math teacher... It will never go away, that thing! I even got the diploma, with honors. - I didn't have any. - That's why you cry?. No. It is the shampoo. I'll try something else, but you will have to keep on for half an hour. I bring the supper. Enter, Maria! I'll do it myself? Do you want me... No need, you will do it tomorrow. Thank you. Goodbye. Do you like it? I can not wear that. Supper! You kidding me... You can't have fun every night. It's not what they say... What says? And who? Newspapers. Do you believe in what they say? Me, not... But it gives me some general idea. A general idea with smell of scandal. Strange, a professor of mathematics... Buying these newspapers. My father and my mother read them... And I only... look a bit. No, thank you. No alcohol. Drink! Or do you want me to call Minou? Not bad. Not bad! Lafitte-Rothschild '53! Getting back to newspapers... ...everything they say is false. Did you read anything about my marriage... And separation from the Greek owner? I'll tell you what really happened. Finally, I told you all my life. Now you understand why I hate journalists. In the beginning, I answered their questions. The next day I read something else. Do you get bored? All this does not interest you? Yes, but now I must go. I was talking for a long time, but tonight I wanted to talk to someone. Are you alone a lot? I love someone. He is like a draft. It comes and goes. I never know when he comes back. And when he's around, he trembles all the time... ...because of the journalists. You want a car to drive? You can not sleep here! Wake up! What is it? Sorry, but there is a man who wants out. What? / I Claims to be a teacher of mathematics. Yes, I remember... Let him pass, Bernard. But he wears one of my suits! I will repay you. / I Also he has one of your towels. Take it. Excuse me, sir, but Mrs. wishes to keep the towel. What towel? The towel on the head. Excuse me. Please I'm in a hurry. Thank you. Goodbye! - That one didn't do anything bad. Nervous? You seem very concerned? A little, yes. Relax. It is not easy. Look, this is my boat. Yes, it's my boat. Nice day for a cruise, right? It relaxes the nerves. I invite you? - Yes... Thank you but I can't, I expect my students. Your students? I am a math teacher in college Bernadette. A boys' school? No, girls. Education is becoming more liberal. The university is emancipated... I do not know how to thank. Let me, pick you up one day after school. This is... That's right, yes. Well, good. I asked you to be more imaginative but this is too much! You want to get fired? It is my costume. What about your head? I couldn't shave. Your hair is pink! Pink! Yes, pink! My only criticism is the dress of your students. Teachers should lead by example. Do not worry about it. It's pink! You have to change it immediately! The inspector is here. I'll introduce you to Miss Landesque... I think she's here. She's not here, Mr. Inspector! I have to tell you incredible story. Did you spend the night with a movie star? Who told you? Her lover. I had dinner with him. No, but listen, it's true! She washed my head. Funny, you begin to know how to lie! Where were we? Is this a new method? - Yeah.. seems efficient. Pierre Durois is very talented. Excuse me, I have to talk to him. Mr. Durois. Yes, Mr. Director? What about exercises? What? The ones I gave you to correct. I forgot them at home. Go during the recess to bring them. It's urgent. Bye. I leave you for a few minutes, do review! Do not go! Do not go! / I I have to see Patrick. It is very important! You are Pierre Durois? Yes, yes. Mr. Pierre Durois is here. Right. Next office after that. Come in Mr. Durois. I am looking for your nephew. Here is your folder. You have my copies? Yes, here they are. You wrote articles for my nephew? Who told you? Patrick. If this is Patrick who told you... I'm expected back at school, if you don't mind You are very talented. Come work for me. I offer you a contract. It's very nice, but it is impossible. Why? You will earn more money than the teacher. Yes? How much do you want?. Just came to tell Patrick... that I will not work more with you. Everything printed here is false, misleading and useless. Lies! Did you come to support the election campaign of your Dad? No, it's my personal opinion. Explain, please. I wrote an article about Jackie Logan. It is excellent. We'll publish this afternoon. But that's impossible! Exactly, that's impossible! Jackie's life is a bunch of nonsense, lies! You certainly know a lot of arithmetic, but not the private life of Miss Logan I know many things. Do not tell me... Where did you hear them? At her home, the other night. Then you know more than us. My students are waiting for me... No, sit down for two seconds. If you want to restore the truth, you must speak. I left with three students in Daniele's car The Indians attacked I ran and hid and I fell in the bathtub Then I got burned with light I went down and I found a leopard in the closet She arrived, washed the hair, shampoo... everywhere Then I got to take a drink and fell asleep next day I returned with a man in the car See? It has nothing to do with what you print! Yes, of course. So you spent the night in her room? Yes, with her. Between us... What happened between you? Between us? Between you Between us who? Between you and her. Between her and me? Between us... Between you and me? Between you and her. Nothing! Are you sure? Most importantly, send my regards to your Dad! Although we are electoral opponents... ...I do not forget the courtesy. A minute. Take a picture of my friend Durois. No, please. It's ridiculous. You are not very talkative! You could have warned that you wouldn't sleep at home. Because I could not warn you... I trust you, but at election time... Anything can happen. Mail and the paper, madam. A little of reading! Oh! How can they print such a nonsense. And this gentleman is running for office... ...against me. Tonight is contradictory meeting, I will close that pornographer. That insane gossip and scandalous news... ...found in the trash cans.. ... and he wants to be a mayor... Pierre Durois. My crazy night with Jackie Logan In Babylon or Sodom. Mayor of Sodom... What is it? I have a tic. You must get medical treatment... This is... by doing all the writing... on... on the tables See you tonight. Hallo. Mr. Durois, please / I How are you? Is urgent. It's about your son. / I See you tonight. It's no time for jokes! / I Yes, yes. See you later. This is not a drugstore here! You buy first and then read. Did you sell many? You're the first. I buy them all. The copies! Sir! That's what you're looking for? Scalpel. What? Sorry for disturbing you. Did you read the newspaper? Yes, why? We're done! Why? Explain. Because of your son! Is my son in the newspaper? He did not read it. Be, right back. Clips. Thank you. Scalpel. Scissors. Clips... Scissors! Clips. I'm too concerned today! I'll finish tomorrow. Follow me. What will become of me? I must do something. We'll publish a denial tomorrow. What? It will say that was a hoax. Gonna work? Of course. Do not worry. I see you in my place. I went through several of these already; clearly not the same. Two girls on the street that look at me and laugh. This is success! What success? Success. I would love to be in your shoes Any time. How are you? You have not seen my binder? Well... We have a triangle ABCD draw a curve... Let's start again. I want action, huh? Good... Jackie, are you ready? Yes. When you want, Claudio. I ask for silence! Engine! Wheeling. Calamity Jane 45/7 Action! Come on, Jackie! This is not good? What are you doing, darling? You... Louder! It's very well what you did, very nice. Now, you know what? We do another take. Have to use more force. Give harder shots. I have fear of hurting them. They are professionals, you can even kill them! Right? Agreed. And silence! Pierre Durois. My crazy night with Jackie Logan Can I... Calamity Jane 45/8 Action! Come on, Jackie. It is still too soft? I can do another! It's very fine. Are you sure? Formidable. What a pity! Anyone ever betrayed you? Often. Trust anyone, you tell him something and he will tell the reporter! My government will be determined that the all condition of the peace shall be resected and we will do... Mr. Wessinger. It's for you. - The President? - No, it's Jackie again. Harry, it's Jackie. Harry, can I talk to you for 5 minutes, please? I'm furious. Who was it? Not another reporter? No! He is a math teacher. It's even worse! Miss Feshner, to the board. Draw a horizontal x, y. Mr. Durois? Yes, I was looking for the chalk. Here is your portfolio. The headmaster wants to see you. Now? No, after. X here... and Y there. Stay there. How I can get revenge / i But sweetheart, that trick is old as the hills Surprise the enemy. Do exactly... Do exactly the opposite of what is expected you to do. Ok, sugar, Try not work too hard. Bye, bye. Come in Jackie, are you here? Are you ready? We are waiting to shoot. Whole team waiting for you. I arrive, but first summon the journalists. Hurry! But you just kick them out. Let them come back. I have something important to say. Yes, yes, of course. Gentlemen, this press conference... ...must be surprise to many... ...but when the heart of a woman bursts of happiness... ...nothing is surprising. I was sometimes a little unpleasant towards the press. And forgive me, I would like you to be... ...the first to know of the big news. Who is it? Someone who lives in your area. Say it! Say it! I am pleased to announce my engagement to... ...Mr. Pierre Durois, professor of mathematics. Who? The son of the Mayor? The same. Where did you meet him? How? In my house. Like in a fairy tale, like in the movies! When I saw Pierre, I underwent his magnetism! He looked at me, I was thrilled... My heart knew it was that... what every woman expects. But Miss Logan, during your career you met famous actors... ...prestigious athletes and well-known politicians. You recently divorced from a rich Greek ship-owner. So, why Pierre Durois? He is a small math teacher. In love, there is no grade. There are other exploits that diplomatic or financial... ...that are enjoyable to a woman. You mean Pierre Durois is a sex bomb? A bomb explodes only once. Pierre is more of an automatic weapon... A sort of "sexual machine gun!" You see him as a Casanova secondary education? Yes, but more bestial and perverse. Do you plan to settle here? You have to ask Pierre, what he will decide. Ask! Go, ask him... Thank you. Wait for me here. Seller of rubbish! What does this mean? Nothing stops you, huh? Is capable of anything. I printed true. There was never an ounce of truth... .. in his journal crap! Your own son told me! I want a denial! Never! Trash! Corrupted! Rotten! So you do not deny? No! Then we shall eat, his small newspaper! Not very rich, huh? Will you deny? Seems to like it. You will catch a indigestion with this. This one... is complete. I have several copies more. Will you deny this? Yes My uncle is there? Yes, but... Jackie Logan just confirm her relationship with son of Mayor. Shit! What about denial? Impossible. What do we do? I have a solution. 'll be back in 5 minutes. What do you want? Let me go! Your father wants to see you. I have my classes! This is urgent! You're hurting me! I'll scream! We say you're crazy. I'll scream! I'm not crazy! So, sex bomb, huh? In what circumstances did you meet Jackie Logan? I do not care! Do you agree when she says you are a fabulous lover? Your students... Are they really in love with you? There's someone in the shower! There! It's him. It's Mr. Durois. But what are you doing? But stop! Stop! No! Listen to me! Oh! So what's new? Rest assured, I managed to get hold of my son. And where he is, journalists will not find out! It means that... What do you mean by that? No, nothing. My son is in this clinic... ...he needs quiet and rest. Very good idea. Now please say about our response. Here I am, my chickadee... Feeling better, my duckling? I brought you a surprise, look... So your little wife will always be with you... Didn't you miss your little Simone, my love? Now we'll be together day and night. Madam, you are mistaken. Your husband is in the front. Pig! Good, let us summarize. First, what happens... ...it's a conspiracy mounted by our opponent. My son restores the truth to everyone. Finally... Are you sure that nothing happened between them... ...And this actress? My son with a clown? It's ludicrous. She is a very pretty woman! If I were in his place... One could ask him some questions. Your son knows at least the truth, he can tell us. Good idea. Follow me. Here it is. Seems very badly injured. It is a camouflage, my idea. My associates and I have some... Questions for you. He must have escaped. But... He went through the window. We are on the 4th floor. Look. Do you have the paper ready? Where are you going? Stop! The surprise of the day was the announcement by Jackie Logan... ...of her engagement with Pierre Durois,... ...son of the Mayor of our City. The issue is very delicate... And the election compels us to remain... ...neutral. However we would like to point out some... ...surprising facts. Actress described Durois... as a being endowed... ...of a magnetic and a large sexual appetite. /i The worst is that Durois tried to meet... ...that hunger... ...on the young gym teacher. We also learned of Durois' forced entry... in showers of Bernadette's Women College... What? Spreading terror among adolescents. Where will it end? In circles close to the Prefecture... ...is discussed again... ...violation of ten nuns of the hospital... ...of Saint-Marcel, ...in our city and whose perpetrator is still on the run. Give me that. Give me Jackie... I pass... Jacky Yes? Are you ready? Yes, yes. The engine? Yes Motor. Wheeling. Action! Is it good? It's beautiful, it's beautiful. Do you see it? Maybe a little dust... There is a car again. A car? What does this mean? Cut! Lower! Get out! - I have to talk. - No! Stop! It's his fault, I saw nothing. Are you crazy? You are crazy... You deny everything! Never! Why you telling all this? You started. You will tell the reporters that all is not truth! On the contrary... I will add that you are terribly jealous. What do you do? Huh? What do you do? We are a couple, right? You may be an exceptional lover. Who is coming? Journalists, radio and photographers. What do we say? I will tell them that nothing happened between us. They see us. Let's go out there. What do you do? We have to keep fighting so they would believe. I've never slept with you! Never! And I'm sure you're not animated by a vile feeling of curiosity... ...but because you want to know the truth. Want to know how our opponents... ...attempted attack. But I prefer to give the floor to... ...our Mayor Hubert Durois. Yes! They tried to attack me! They tried to destroy, neutralize me... But no one is so faithful and courageous like any honest opponent. They tried to hit me in the back... ...attacking what I love most... Which vividly symbolizes... He exaggerates a bit anyway. No, just... They tried to involve my son... ...a sad story of showman. Story built by journalists assumptions... More interested in selling... ...then respect the truth. My son is living symbol of virtue... Your Dad speaks well, don't you think? I'll see if my parents are there... My son will confirm this himself. He is here behind the scenes, with his fiance!. Daniele! What are you doing here? The movie is over so I'm leaving. I wanted to say goodbye. You are really incredible woman. Are you sincere? I lie very badly. True. I'll go see your movies. I read your speech, your articles... No, that's it. Goodbye. I knew it! Dirty liar! You will ruin everything! These children, living examples... ... a youth... ...who rejects all manifestations... Bitch! Stop! Have a little patience. In a few minutes my son come... ...and explain himself on this plateau! Dad! Dad! Dad! I have nothing to do with it!
