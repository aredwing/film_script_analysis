"Where does it begin, where does it end?" "Where do these destinations lie?" "Neither could he understand, nor could I." "It's a strange tale.." Good morning, ma'am. - Morning. Good morning, ma'am. I needed to discuss some papers with you. Just give me 2 minutes. Hi. A wedding necklace around the neck .and a hint of lust in the eyes. Excuse me? Who are you? A new intern. Temporary. For 3 months. But I'll get a permanent job if you recommend me. Let's see if you last that long. Trust me, I last very long. By the way, aren't you an associate editor? Don't you have a cabin or something here? I feel suffocated behind closed doors. Do you have a problem with that? - Not at all. And the view from here is great as 'well. Quite hot, huh? I, mo, like Gold-Gym trained types. Rough, tough, puff. Enough. I'm gay, by the way. What is this, madam?! Such a at reaction? I deserve an overreaction over this statement. Why? You are just a gay, not a terrorist. You should tell that to my dad. He would've spared me if I was Kasab. He wants to hang me as I am gay. I don't blame him. I, mo, want to do the same. Well... Sorry. I want to impress you. 111at's why I am going a little overboard. I don't get impressed so quickly. No stress. I've got 3 months. What's your name? Avinash. Avinash what? What's lies in this "What", ma'am? It's this "What" that has screwed me up. Just plain and simple Avinash. Right. Can 'we 'work now'? - Yeah, sure. Hurry up, guys. We've to meet the deadline. Amrita, c'mon. Hurry up. We have to lock in 5. Gayatri. - Yes? -What is this? Stars first spread the rumours then deny it. We, mo, publish a lie and then we write... "Remained unavailable for comment." It takes two to tango. Nowlet me work. - Okay. Amrita... Sauce? You want some... breadsticks? No. You know... I always wanted to know... How do you come to know if someone is gay? Simple Go and ask, "Are you a Shridevi fan or a Madhuri fan?" If he's a Shridevi fan then he is definitely gay. She's high cam, dude. All gay men love her. Wow. What analysis! 111ere's always an answer for everything in Bollywood. If the canvas looks lovely, I'm going for it. Avi... Have you met Rahul? He's from our marketing team. Hi. - Hey, dude. By the way, big Shridevi fan. I love the "Wild Winds" song. Excuse me. Shridevi, huh? Love her. Coffee? Black with two sugars. Huh? Okay, no sugar. Go! Please! Okay. Hey. - I think we'll do this. Hmm? - Hello. Present? Fifty shades of grey. I've been avoiding it. It's just cheap porn literature. Means you'll read it for sure. Of course. Why are you in such a hurry? I'm going to catch a movie. MAMI festival. I'm giving myself a treat. It's my birthday. It's your birthday! Why didn't you tell me?! What's there to tell? It's like any other day. Who are you going with? Me and my loneliness. I've bought a ticket for it as well. Nonsense. You're coming over to my place for dinner. No, Gayatri. Why be formal? It's not a big deal. It's a very big deal. You're coming to my house, tonight. No excuses. This is final. Gayatri, listen to me. - Otherwise, I'll reject it. You'll be ready by 9? Yup. Move. - Wow. Smells good. Thank God, I made a little extra. For your surprise guest. By the way what's her name? His name is Avinash. You invited a guy for dinner? Why? Jealous? You have this emotion in you as well? I thought you buried it in your childhood. Seriously. Who is he? He's works with me in my office. He's mad. He's gay. He's 911V? Okay. So this is the overreaction he was talking about. Who? Thank you. So you 'work for ON 'TV'? Who do you do? He works as a... - I'm a political analyst and a newsreader. Newsreader! I always wanted to meet one. Why? To ask what's the challenge in telling about someone's death? And it must be very challenging to write about... ...the meaningless life of Bollywood stars, right? By the way, you are talking about my profession. I'm offended. We've already talked about it, Gayatri. Two years ago. - Oh wow. I think you guys are going to fight. That's good. It's said that the make-up sex is the best. Make-up sex! Today is his birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday. Thank you. But Why aren't you making at me? I am. - You still aren't. I'm gay, but I don't bite. Unless, someone wants me to. Over familiarity. It's not just his but the problem of his generation. Over familiarity. I don't belong to my generation. What do you mean? I like everything big. Big people. Big talks. Old memories. Old songs. Old songs? Dev loves old Hindi film music. Me mo. What music, man! "Come to me." My all time favorite. "Come to me." Madan Mohan, 1964. Yeah, Madan Mohan, man. What great music he used to create. He was the most underrated composer. The more you praise him the less it is. True. Dev, why don't you take him to your special room? Why just special, I'm ready to go into any room. Just shut up! He's my husband. - True. "Come to me." "For we might never get such a night again." - Oh, my God. Wow! What a room, Boss! It's even better than sex! You've got used to crossing the limits. It's now my profession. You spend a lot of time in this room. Right? Yes. Me and my loneliness. To listen to music in solitude? What's the story behind it? Music changes the way you think. And sometimes doesn't even give you time to think. May I? Jagjit Singh. "Come closer..." "Furl might not come to you again." You are smiling a lot. What's the sorrow that you're hiding? "Embrace me..." By the way, this was a question. "For there might never be such affection in the eyes again." Gayatri. - Yes? I wanted to talk to you in private. Just keep trying. I'll be back in 5. Hmm? Yeah, tell me. How often do you have sex with your husband? What? Are you mad? I'm not going to discuss my sex life with you in front of everyone. Tell me. It's very important for me. Tell me, please. What pleasure will you gain from it? Self-pleasure? Oh, God. - Now don't be a prude. You come here everyday dressed to kill. Now why you are acting like a virgin. And yes, if you don't give me the numbers, I'll ask for details. Once or twice. - In a week? Not bad! In a month. Sometimes, even longer. - That's all? Look, sex is over.. Sex is overrated, okay? Many years after marriage, it happens only sometimes. And love? Dev. Yes, Dev? Yeah, I'm going to be late from work. Yeah, I'm going to mom's house. Yeah, I'll see you. Okay. Love you. Bye. I'll have to see you later. - Yeah. Hi. Hi. Gayatri isn't at home. -I know. I came hereto give you this CD. Raft's rare recordings. You'll like them. Thank you. Cool. You want to come in or... - Oh no. You want to come out? What? You want to come out? Where? Just come with me. Trust me, you'll not regret it. Come. But where? Where are you taking us? Just come with me. Hurry up. - No, let's go back. Come. Come. Come. Come. Hurry up. Hurry up now. Just come. Hey, where's Savitri? I don't know. Try there. Savitri ! Savitri... Here you are. Look, I've brought a big shot with me. Will you sing for us? Get lost! I won't. Please. - She doesn't want to sing. Let's go. Dev, please. One second. Please. - I'll charge. Yes, of course. He has a lot of money. He'll pay. Start on the count of four. One... Two... Three... Faun "Come to me." "For we might never get such a night again." "For we might never meet again." "Come to me." "For we might never get such a night again." "For we might never meet again." "Come to me." "To me." Pay UP- Don't encourage this. What will you do with the money? I'll feed my siblings. Are you lying? No, sir. I don't lie. It's bad to lie. "We are fortunate to get this moment." "Look at me all you want by getting close to me." "For you might never have this pleasure again." "For we might never meet again." "Come to me." "To me." I don't know what happened to Dev last night. He was in such a great mood. He was very happy- He didn't tell you why? No. And, then We...? You guys had sex last night? Yeah. And it was great! What happened? Nothing. Just not feeling well. I'll see you later. Are you okay? - Yeah.

I'll get your money Know what your father did today? Because I'm beautiful, I'll be Miss India. And I'll send every single child to school. When I grow up I'll be ajockey... because I like horses and I like speed. I want to be a veterinarian... and build a big home for all the street clogs. I'll be an astronaut... because there is no gravity in outer space and I want to y. I want to be a tennis player... I want to represent India... and appear on TV. Spiderman! I can climb anywhere and jump from anywhere. And nothing will happen to me. I'll be a lawyer... I like helping people. Moreover, I never lose an argument. I'll become a cop. I'll catch the thieves and I'll get a bike. Businessman. I want to run my dad's factory. And make lots of money. I want to play football... I don't know... I don't like anything else. Raider'.! Out! Vicky! Let's go! Sir, not Haider, please! Sir, we need him. This one will score for the other team. See... Ronaldo. Forget this game, we've lost. Go! Pass here... Don't crowd around Sid. Spread out and play. Pass the ball. Focus Vicky, don't be scared. Come on... pass... Come on, Vicky, win that ball. Come on... move... Sid... move! Who are you passing to? Make room. Vicky, go for the ball. Come on, Vicky. Come on... run... Run! Vicky, move! Tomorrow you start training. Three times a 'week... OR? I don't want to learn football. Vicky... what you want doesn't matter. What matters is what's good for you. Football will make you tough. Dad, my class is going on a field trip to Badami Caves. Good. We need to pay Rs 2000 for it. Kavya, I just paid Rs 3000 for Vicky's coaching. You go next year. But my classmates are going now! Forget your class, I will take you to Badami Caves. But they are so ancient. What if they fall by next year? All boys play football... you will also have fun. But I don't want to play. Enough now. If your dad wants you to learn football... that's what you will do. After all, he's asking you to play... not scale a mountain! But I hate it. Goal, goal, goal! I don't want to shoot a goal. You want to see the movie? You want to eat in a restaurant? Then stop this drama. If your father gets upset... no movie and no dinner! If you want to come, get dressed... and allow me to get ready. Come on! Hi... Vicky... Gaurav's here. They are going to play cricket. Tell him I'm not coming. Can we get his bat? They 'want your bat. It's under the couch! Vicky... What are you doing? Show... What are you wearing? Look at this crazy boy! Is this a joke? You find this funny? He is only a child. That's your lipstick he's rearing. What are you'll turning him into? Dad... - You shut up! Isn't he in your clothes? Did you make him wear this? Do you have any sense? He is your brother. And you... what are you? What are you turning into? What is your plan? What will you be when you grow up? Do you have an answer? Idiot. If I ever see you like this again... I'll break every bone in your body. Stop this music. You have turned this house into a multiplex. Heads are stuffed with filmy crap. Hurry now, go change. Do you know why dad was so angry'? Vicky, please talk. I shouldn't have touched mom's things. I think he was angry because... you were dressed like a girl. So? So means? What's wrong in being a girl? But, honestly I think destiny has a lot to do with it. And... I really feel I've been very blessed... that I've had such amazing support from the audience and from my fans. Fans and audience came much later. But technically, you're a miracle story. Think about it, on paper... you're a failure. You should've failed. Think about it... a girl from England who doesn't know anyone in the film industry... and can't speak a word of Hindi... and 'what, 5-6 years later... you've done 30 films and 26-27 are superhits. I mean, how... what's the secret? I just followed my dream. There you have it people... follow your dreams. Katrina's simple formula to success. Nothing is that simple. But if you have the will... you will only do what your heart says. Yeah, but the world is not a kind place. I mean, how did you get people to take you seriously? Didn't people discourage you, mock you? That's why... sometimes you have to hide your dream. What do you mean? I mean, people don't always understand you. So they will discourage you. But you know what your dream is. So you have to keep it alive. You have to nurture it. You have to protect it. And anyway, you don't have to share everything with the world? There's a right time for everything. You know... you can do anything you want! You can be who ever you want to be. Follow your heart... for there is magic in your dreams. Magic. If you believe them... they will come true. Just believe it will happen... and no one can stop you. What are you doing? Get off. What were you doing? I know what I want to be when I grow up. What? Sheila. What's that? Dancer. Like Sheila. I love dance. She herself spoke to me last night. Who? Sheila. Katrina Kaif? You'll be late... What's this? Vicky... I put that up. I love Katrina Kaif. You people... Take that off. Don't tell dad about this dance stuff. Only four days are left to pay for the trip, I really want to go. - How much is it? - Rs. 2000 The society payment is due, Rs 1500. I suggest you bring your classmates here. Our building is also ancient. It too may collapse by next year. Dad... I've decided what I want to be when I grow up. Stop this nonsense, or you'll get late. I want to become a pilot. To be a pilot you have to be physically fit. 111at's why sports is good for you, focus on sports. Then you can be a pilot. Vicky, give that packet to Kavya. What is this? It's for Kavya. But my birthday is next month. This is a surprise. I thought you might like it. And what about me? Only for Kavya. She isn't going on the trip. I promise you can go next year. This is your favourite... Katrina Kaif! Thank you! Everything is for you. Even my gift is something that you want. Please! I don't want a bat. I don't want football coaching either. But there is money for football and not for my history trip. You are so lucky, it will be really boring. Shut up, Vicky... you are an idiot. Here... all yours. Rs. 1750. How much are we short by? Rs. 250. I need Rs. 2000 for my trip. What's your dream? Only if you let me sleep, can I dream. I mean... howl want to be a dancer like Sheila... what do you want to be? Nothing. Nothing? But I want to see the world. I want to put up a map on this wall... and every country or city I visit, I want to come back and put a tick unit. Oh, so you want to become an airhostess? I want to be a passenger. You know, there's magic in dreams. Katrina said. If you believe your dream... it can be true. Even hers came true. You mean, if I believe... I will go on the trip? Dear Katrina... please help my sister to go on her trip. Mama... Yes? Wait... What? You can go on the trip. Dad said so? No, I'm saying so. But I need you to promise me one thing. Actually two. What? You have to tell dad you got all the money from the piggy bank. And the other? Whatever Katrina says, you have to believe. Don't you remember... that I'm still Rs. 250 short? Come with me... We'll be back by 8:30 pm... no TV! Bye... Ladies and gentlemen... thank you for coming here on a Sunday afternoon. For your viewing pleasure we have... all the way from A-vving, apartment 14... the one and only... Sheila Sharma! Come on, Vicky! Come on! All praise Lord Shiva! My Guru is 116 years old... he's fit as a Mestler...! Brother jay! What's up? - Your father is unwell! I'm working now! I'll come home later. My Guru lives in the Himalayas... ...he's come to the gathering for darshan... - Brother Vijay...! What...? - Your father's calling you! Buzz off... I'm working. So I was saying... - Brother...? What...?? Your father is puking and pooping! He's on his deathbed! What...???? Sir, I must attend to my father! Come on, boy...! I'll come back later, sir. - Brother, I want to pee! Don't, this bridge can't handle your tsunami-piss! Quick...! I must pee now! - Boy, you're destroying this city piss by piss. Mother! What happened? Where were you, son? I was at the holy gathering! - Go in... he's calling you! Father...! Shut the door, please! What happened, father? Nnthing! What were you doing? Taking devotees for holy darshan at the gathering. Father, why did you call for me? You knowwhen I was your age, all I did was watch movies! Then one day, your grandfather fell very ill. He'd had a stroke, you see! 111s local doctor said he's a gunner! So father called me and said just one thing to me... "I realized the true essence of life after watching the film 'Two Rivers'..." "And since then I've followed every twitch of my idol Sir Dilip Kumar." "Right from the film 'Two Rivers' to 'Simple Gopi' to 'This World'..." So then he gave me this bottle of honey and said... "Here...! Take this and go to Mumbai and meet Sir Dilip." "Request him to dip his finger in the honey and lick it." So I reached Mumbai... ...found Sir Dilip's abode and waited in front of it. For 3 'whole days! Finally, I got his darshan! I said, "Sir, my father warships you." "It would give him much joy if you dipped your esteemed finger in this and licked it." So the great man obliged me. He dipped... and licked! Your grandfather had a spoon of that honey daily! And lived for 6 years more than the silly doc's 6 months prediction...! He died only after seeing 'The Merchant'...! And on his deathbed, he finally sang in his wife's ears... "...l...love...U..." So son, now it's time for... Amitabh Bachchanm! I want to be blessed by him like father! I thought a lot about what would not rot and last this journey you're about to take. And so... where's this... 'murabba'! Ask him to please bite into it and leave the rest for me. The brightest star in the sky... Bachchan! The Angry Young Man of cinema... Bachchan! How he reeled into our hearts...! ...he came... we saw... he conquered! I'm going to Mumbai to meet Amitabh Bachchan! You see, he loves my mother's murabba! Every summer he calls her and requests a fresh one. I've been taking it to him for 5 years. So fondly he calls her by her name... Malati! But... just one murabba? A single umbilical cord is enough to bind the love of two people, man!! Brother, you've reached Mumbai! Every kid's favorite, daughter or son... You guessed it, it's Bachchanm! His name seals a Super Hit. He carved his fate with his ovm True Grit. A word to the heroes, studs and laddies... "Guess who's your daddy...!" Give it up for Bachchan! Brother, you said I'll be there in a ash... ...but we're going round in circles...! Voila! The Bachchan house! What's the fare? - 2100 rupees. Isn't that a lot? Reaching Bachchan's house is not cheap! Any other actor's house would've cost you just 500. You must be from Allahbad. I'm hereto meet Amitabh Bachchan! Amitabh Bachchanm? You can't meet him now. Tell him I'm from his hometown Allahbad and my name is also 'Vijay'! That won't 'work. Back home, my home is only a kilometer away from where he grew up. Also, he uses my name on screen... 'Vijay'! Please tell him all this... I'll wait in the living room till then. Ok, but this is not the way to meet sir. Then how'? - If you 'want to meet him... go to his other bungalow 'where sir gives darshan to his devotees! Hey, I don't want a darshan, I want a meeting. For darshan people usually come to me back home! See, he is a very busy man. He can't meet anyone like this... Yes, but my business with him will take just 2 minutes. Besides, we're practically cousins. Why don't you write him a letter... stating your name and address... - A letter? And then...? Then just post it! Oh, that'll take too long! Then courier it. - I'm sure he has a phone, call him! Now howwill we have his phone number? Then just call someone 'who does. How'? Today is Sunday... our office is shut! You're misunderstanding me... I'm not hereto become an actor. I've a small matter with him. With your help I'll be done and will gladly go back home! But it doesn't work like this. But you won't even call him! - Just write a letter... Are you from Allahbad? - No, I'm from Kanpur! Ah! That explains the gap in our communication! You see, 'when you tell him that his namesake from his hometown... a brother from another mother has arrived, he won't say no! This may all be true... but 'what proof do 'we have? You'll have proof when you tell him, right?! But he isn't in the city! 111at's why we suggest you write... And that's why I suggest calling him...! We've explained the protocol to you. Now please leave! Don't touch, please...! We've heard you out...! - Plenty like you... Leave! Don't get physical, please! You guys are not making sense! - Leave, man! Ok, one last thing...! At least tell me who has sir's phone number? In a 100 years there's been no other... God broke the mould 'when he made The One! Hey...! Bachchan! His style gave the silver screen... its glamour and gleam! Hey... Bachchan! His magic has such fury... That temperatures go tandoori! So to the Pitts, Clooneys and Bradleys... "You know who's your Daddy!" Give it up for Bachchan! Murabbam! Murabba, brother...! What do you do? I'm a huge Bachchan fan and I'm going all over to tell people about him! You know, "howwe love each other" and "You gotta do the Bhangra...!" "Huh...!" Hey, egg-man...? - Yeah! Can I get a job here? Work? Why not...? You could start by putting your bag dovm...! Yeah, right here... I'll keep an eye unit. Serve this. STo 'whom? - The tall, dark one there.. So you're also hereto become an actor? I'm hereto meet Amitabh Bachchan. Wants to meet the Bachchan! A meeting had brought me here too! Who'? - Sui Kumar'.! The hero of 'My Foreign Lover'? - Yup!

Look, you can go in only once sir selects you. But I simply want to feed him this murabbam! Murabbam? Yes...! How can he eat this moldy stuff? What if gets an upset tummy? Will you host 'Who wants to be a Millionaire'? Sir, its my father's dying wish. I'll go as soon as he bites into it. Ok, let me see! You wait here... I'll deliver the jar inside. Brother, did my work happen? I've delivered your murabba inside. Can you find out if sir has eaten it? Your murabba has gone to the lab for analysis, to see if it can be eaten. Amitabh Bachchan can't eat just anything. Please ask him to eat it. 'Cos I don't have money to eat anymore. I have to leave in 2 days. I have a return ticket. I can't bear it anymore... Aren't Kanpur and Allahbad neighbours? I've told you all I know. I'm just a security guard! If you don't help me, who will? Please don't make me run around in circles. Look, if I hear anything by 6 pm I'll tell you, 0k? But after the shift changes please ask the next watchman. What are you doing, man? Don't crowd the drive way...! Go, man! Who is it? What the...! Just give me a minute, please, brother! Not even for a nano second! - Please listen to me... I can hear you well from here! How much will you take? - Take what? How much money will you charge to feed Amitabh Bachchan the murabba? Sit...! Really? - Sit dovm! You should've just said earlier. We could've saved time... Nowadays everyone takes a little money under the table... Hey- why're you hitting me? Bribing me...? You'll bribe me? My father served there. Nnwl serve there. You want to tarnish all these years of loyalty with money? I'm here for my father's last wish... I thought I'll fulfill it in 2 minutes and leave... ...but this has turned into a holy crusadem! Please don't touch my feet... I'm not a thief, brother. I want to give him murabba, not poison. Please understandmmy condition is unbearable now. I don't have money for food, I've been thrown out of 'where I 'was staying. They charge 2 bucks to take a shit in this city! This is my plight. Please don't touch my feet. - Help me... Enough... enough... - Please, brother... Tell you 'what... come tomorrovw'? You'll get it done? - Yes. Promise me... give me your word... - I dn...! I swear, man!

I'll get it done tomorrow. I don't even have any place to go to now... But never mind that... I'll come tomorrow I'm in your hands now. Brother, did you meet Daddy-Long-Legs? Did you meet the Bachchan? Did you meet him? Did you meet the man, man? Hey... wake up! Here's your murabba! Did Amitabh Bachchan eat it? - Yup. You sure it was him? - Yes, he ate it. What proof do you have? Anyone could've eaten it, right? One minute...! Please show me your teeth. I've seen his teeth in movies and on TV. I'll know if it wasn't him. He's eaten it, man. - But...? If he's eaten it why can't he just say it himself? Howwill that hurt him? I've come all the way for this... Hold on...! Let him in! (Amitabh Bachchan's famous dialogues) Let him in, please! That's ok...! Sir, I'm Vijay. I'm from Allahbad! My father is on his death bed, sir. He has sent my mother's hand-made murabba... please eat some! Yes, I just did... wasn't it this one? - Yes, sir! But I didn't see it with my ovm eyes. What will I say to father, sir? I'd like to confirm... so could you please... re-bite? Alright... open it...! It is imprisoned in shops... Imprisoned in shops, jailed in glass jars... But it is born in our homes, and raised from the seeds of hope. Only by tasting it does one know the meaning of sweet pain! It reveals the truth... and the heart of the matter! With every passing season, its avor defies reason... I said, "...just tell him I'm from his hometown..." but they refused! I said, "I've a tiny bit of business with him"... but no! Once they even said that my sweet little murabba... ...sitting quietly above me... needs to be tested in a labl! So I said when my dear mother makes her famous murabba at home... ...the 'whole colony comes over to gorge on it. But they made me dance between bungalows... like a dog chasing its tail. In fact, I actually befriended a dog! I said, "just tell him I'm from his hometovm, he'll meet me..." But no! - Then 'what? Finally, truth always wins! News spread like fire and they were forced to open the gate! All of them with their tails between their bum-less behinds. So I entered, and one took my bag... looking sheepish as hell! Starched uniforms surrounded me in stunned silence. Like frozen parrots. But the [Mhhhadan in me stayed in repose'.! An Allahbad street vendor is also an intellectual. It's in our soil... we can't help being great! We drip intellect... and integrity! Such great men are from here. Sir Bachchan being one of them. Now those fools couldn't see my inner Allahbad-ian... Marinated in the sweet juice of patience... this jar preserves history! Here... taste this murabbam! Let it trickle into your heart! Born from Life... The longer it lives... the richer it is. The many seasons its savored... resonate in its avor. Always tastes better than it did yesterday... and tomorrows sweetness will outshine today. So here... taste this murabba! Harnessed from the maker's love... Here... taste this murabba! It's enriched by the maker's generosity... ...so let this murabba trickle into your heart! Mother...! Wjay...! Why have you lost so much weight, son? Weren't you eating? - Where's father? May you live long! So Amitabh Bachchan met you? - Yes... very nicely. He ate it in front of my ovm eyes. And where did the jar break? It... didn't. It's the same one. Where did it breakm? Before you boarded the train, or on it, or after you got off? On the train. And the murabba? - It got squished under someone's shoe. When your grandfather sent me with the honey... ...ants had invaded the 'whole bottle. Sir Dilip refused to lick it! He said... "I would've... but not this infested jar...!" So I decided to dip my ovm finger and licked it! God knows if father lived due to the proteins in the ants or the honey! But I'll tell you this, my son... don't ever put murabba in a bottle of pickle! Did you really meet Amitabh bachchan? Yeah. Father asked me to, so I did. So what did he say? Who? Oh my God, Amitabh Bachchan?? He just blessed me... and I left! And father? "Don't ever put murabba in a bottle of pickle!"
