I must replace Mr. Izeki. Listen, by the way, how's your English? Have you improved it? What do you mean if I have improved it? Don't you know that I studied English in school? A few days ago you couldn't make a phrase, you sucked. Yes, it's truth. Maybe I should have taken conversation classes. I told you to study in case I got the promotion. I know. And it will be a problem. But I didn't think they would give it to you so soon. No, eh? Ok, so when it's going to happen? What? The baby thing. Next year, at the beginning of January. Yes? It will be fantastic. Happy New Year. No, it's ok. I don't want more, I will eat now. - Now? Why? - Because I must go to Hakone. But today is Saturday. Do you work on Saturday?

Auntie and uncle are going very soon. Your father doesn't like America, not a bit. Nor England or France? That's right, I don't like them either. Then what do you like? I only like Japan. Yes, hello? Yes, Yumiko is my wife's sister. Yes, she has just gone home. What? Her husband? Where? In Hakone? Yes. What happens? - Is Hiroshi in Hakone? - Yes. He got run over by a car. My God! His wife is late, it's almost dawn. Where is the driver that ran over him? At the police station. We should have prevented him... from going around, don't you think? Yes, I knew he couldnt hold his liquor. Darling! I will go alone. You don't have to go. It would be better if you don't. No. I will go. The company whose driver ran over him sent it. Of course,... they must be very concerned knowing that the victim was a Government employee. You know? The company director came to see me yesterday. Yes By the way, it is necessary to cover Eda's position as soon as possible. - Have you already chosen somebody? - No, not yet. Then do it soon, we cant waste any more time. Yes. Look, the one that ran over him. SHIRO MISHIMA. MEIJI COMMERCIAL COMPANY. Mrs. Eda... I am Shiro Mishima, of Meiji Commercial. I'm very sorry about the accident. You? Are you the driver? Are you the one who killed my son? What is it that you want now? You You have killed my son. So why did you come here? We'll talk some other time. We'll compensate you for what happened. Mrs. Eda, we want to express you... ours more sincere condolences. You Where are you going? Yumiko! Let's go. You shouldn't have come. Do you want to see the director? Yes. What are you going to do? The transfer is already issued. You are suspended temporarily. What else do you want to know? I believe the reason is clear. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce... is very important for commercial companies as ourselves,... there's no need to say it. You have killed one of its civil employees, although accidentally. That's very serious. I ask you to wait... for the police investigation to finish. As you said, it was an accident. Do you mean it was not your responsibility? No, I feel morally responsible. That's why I will compensate them. Do you think you shouldn't be suspended? The truth is they have told me... that after the temporary suspension I'll be transfer to Aomori. Is that true? Who told you that? That's what you're planning to do with me. Is it true? I'll be sincere with you. Who was with you when you had the accident? I already know that you were with Mr. Bennett,... but there was somebody else, wasn't it? Yes, some lady called Harumi. - Still - No excuses. It's not an excuse. I was ordered to entertain Mr. Bennett and that's what I did. In addition, the manager knew about it. Some journalists... have tried to turn this into a scandal,... to gain from the situation. They have blackmailed me. The police also came. They accuse us of promoting and exerting prostitution. I would like to know if you are responsible for that. - Sir, the board is waiting. - I'll be right there. Ok. I am going to go to Aomori. If that's an order, I don't have other choice but to obey,... but I believe you have other reasons to send me there. I want to know what are they. Junko and I have plans What are you suggesting now? This is a working place,... I won't discuss private matters here, it's not the suitable place. On the other hand, I've already told you more than once:... I don't approve your engagement with my daughter. I don't approve it at all. Are we clear? Good morning. He's already arrived, he's inside. Thank you. - Hello, how are you? - Fine. It was a little dirty, wasn't it? Yes, as usual. I've spoken to your father. Really? And what did he say? Well, you were right. He has intention to transfer me. In addition, I must stay home until the trial for the accident is over. I'll prepare some tea, if you want. You could come with me to Aomori. Aomori is not very different from Tokyo. You would be fine there. I cannot go to Aomori. And my father doesn't have anything to do with it,... it is my decision. I'm sorry, I really am,... but I cannot go. I understand. Don't worry. I owe you so much You have come here to cook... many times, very often. You have been everything to me during these two years, you have been my life. I'll go get some tea. Therefore,... the decision of this court concerning this case,... after listening to all parts and examining the evidence,... is the following: there's no indication of any crime,... neither in the witnesses statements... nor in the evidence presented. Therefore, the defendant is found not guilty. The defendant's car had a flat tire,... which caused an imbalance in the wheels alignment This imbalance made the car... swerve out of control towards the victim. The defendant didn't have time to control the vehicle,... The tire deflated quickly. Therefore, this court concludes... that the accident was beyond the defendant's control. The defendant is found not guilty of reckless driving. He won't have to face any kind of penalty either,... nor indemnify the victim's family,... since he is declared free of all legal responsibility. Mrs. Eda? Yes. This is the resolution of the case. If you like, I can explain you the content briefly, in case you have any doubts. According with the Public Services National Law,... and considering all circumstances,... a pension will be granted to Mr. Eda's widow,... for life. You will receive 72,700 yens a year. This amount is 10% the deceased's average salary,... since the time he was employed was inferior to 10 years. If Mrs. Eda removed herself from the family register... or she married again,... the payment of the pension would be automatically terminated. Do you have any questions? Yes, we presented pregnancy certificate... and you haven't said anything about Mrs. Eda is only three months pregnant. Therefore, there is no additional amount for that. As you can see, the funeral expenses are included. The wreath comes from the Minister. Now if you could sign the receipt Yes. Yumiko Excuse me. - I think we are late. - No. Yumiko. What would you like to drink? What do you want? A cold tea? - Two teas, please. - Very well. What? Which was the verdict? Not guilty. Not guilty? Doesn't you have to pay for what happened? No indemnification? Nothing? No, legally no. Then, we cannot Look, this is my salary. I do not make much money, Mrs. Eda,... but I'll pay what I can. Seventeen days ago,... my husband and I were seating here. We were having a toast to his promotion Yumiko We were going to move to the Washington Embassy... We were leaving in four days. I'll pay what you want, I'll give you an amount every month. How much do you want altogether? I don't want your money. I want my husband back, that is what I want. Wait, please. Yumiko, leave us alone. I will speak to him. Go home. for ten years. It's a rather hard punishment. Not so hard, it's not so much money. And Yumiko didn't want it, good luck that I helped her. If we don't look out for you, you end up with nothing. It doesn't matter, I don't want anything from him. Come on... If I think that from now on, we must live with this money I won't accept it. Come on, money is always money. - And the contract? - We will sign it soon. - That man is very good. - Why? He is not guilty. If I were him, I wouldn't pay anything. I would see no reason. I think... I will send the money to Kyoto. Don't be a fool,... Are you sending money to your husband's parents? But I don't understand that you want to send money to them,... after what they tried to do to you. They don't deserve it, they wanted you out of the family,... they wanted to get rid of you to have Hiroshi's pension. How much is left? - 72.700 a year. - I see. Then it's 6.000 a month, isn't it? Stop, please. Don't speak about money any more. How much long can you stay at the residence? About two months. We must look for an apartment. She can stay and live with us. There isn't enough room for we all. I know it's going to be hard,... even more you being pregnant. Come on! - Just a little more! - Yes. A little more. Leave it there. Come on, hurry up. Ok, let's go! - I leave it go off, eh? - Yes. - Three. - Three. - Four. - Four. - Five. - Five. - Six. - Six. - Seven. - Seven. So how is the boy? Really? Fantastic! Happy new year. Yumiko! Come on in. Ah, it's you, hello. I was out shopping some things. What do you want? I brought the contract for you to review it and sign it. Ah, very well, thanks, I will sign. By the way, I suppose you received my letter. No. I asked you to send me the money. She will be moving soon. - Very well. - Thanks. Just a second. Tell him to go away immediately. And not to come back, not even come near again. AOMORI STATION MEIJI COMMERCIAL COMPANY. OFFICE OF AOMORI. Good morning, I come from Tokyo. Mi name is Shiro Mishima. Ah, Shiro Mishima,... they said you would arrive today. Come on in, have a seat. - I am Kasai, the director. - Nice to meet you. - This place isn't comfortable. - No. Yuri, is the accommodation ready? Yes. - What do we do now? We leave? - Yes, let's go. - Yumiko, we'll go now, ok? -Yes. Hello, Yumiko. Good afternoon. - Are you pleased with my sister? - Yes, she is a very hard worker. - Ok, good bye. - Good bye. Good bye. That man looked like a gangster or something like that. He's a client of the company. I see. I would like to have a house like this one. What do you came here for? The money has arrived from Mishima, here you are. Thanks. Still hard to accept it? - It comes handy. - Of course it does. This will help you cover the money you send to Kyoto. When you open the envelope, is there usually some message? No, a few words, nothing in particular. As long as he sends the money, he can write what he wants. Yes, sure. Although I hate to depend on others. Have you already thought about what we talked yesterday? I don't want to return to my home town. Why? Wrap up, you'll catch a cold. You have a hard and exhausting job. Ah, hello. I come to bring the money in person. Thanks, thank you very much. - Wait, I will give you a receipt. - No, it's ok. How is Mrs. Eda? She is not very well. The company where she worked closed... and now she has to find another job. I've seen her today. It's not easy for a woman to get by all by herself. And the money you give her.... is hardly enough for the expenses of the house. I beg you that you continue to help her. You'll do that, right? Yes. Thanks, thank you very much. I'm almost sure I will be able to convince the director... so they send back to Tokyo. Thanks. Your case couldn't be called a labor failure, that's clear. Time will put things in their place. Ok, how are you doing in Aomori? It is too sad. The boss's daughter got engaged, you knew that? She got engaged to a banker's son. Anyway, don't feel bad. Time heals all wounds. Drink. I forgot her long time ago. I am glad. Eh, Yuriko, come over here, come on. - Am I not interrupting? - We've finished. Come, sit over here. Hello. How are you doing? Thank you very much, Sir. Thank you very much, Sir. - Thank you very much, Sir. - There you have. I'm very sorry, I can't accept anything from clients. Good morning. It is only a letter, read it. Please. I've already said "no" the other day. - Hello, dear. - Hello. You forget the change. What? Not yet? I appreciate Katsuko's offer, but Speaking of Katsuko. I believe she's more kind lately. Above all, ever since our brother died. Do you remember when she wanted to expand? She even let us know when she decided to construct the annexe. I know the Shinoe hotel is legally hers,... I don't deny that, but it's also the place where we were born. You don't have to be afraid. And, in addition, you will also have work there. I don't know why, but I don't like her. And why is that? We don't get along. But you two used to get along just fine. Listen, you have told her to write, haven't you? No, not at all. I swear it was Katsuko's idea. She said: We widows have to take care of each other". I'm sorry, no. I almost forget... The money. It arrived yesterday. It's arriving late lately. Why don't you want to return to your home town? I want to live without being tied to anything or anybody. And I don't want that money, I really mean it. Dear lady,... "concerning the register problem... "which we discuss over the telephone last week,... "I ask you to read the family register copy which I attach,... "corresponding to the Eda family. "As you can see, your name has been removed... "from the family register. "The legal processes were completed... "the past March, 21th. "Therefore, you are no longer tied... "to the Eda family in any way. "It's our wish that you can... have a new happy life as a married woman. Greetings". "Therefore, you are no longer tied... "to the Eda family in any way. "It's our wish that you can... have a new happy life as a married woman..." Mishima, why don't you come with me? Give me a hand, I speak very little English. I'm done for today, I am tired. I'm very sorry. Mr. Mishima! You have a visit. - Who is it? - I don't know, it's outside. You were born near Towada Lake. Well, I came here a year ago. How careless she is! She's from the countryside, you can tell. Let's switch. So this is your home town. I won't speak bad of it. Here you are, your money. - But, why? - I've already explained it. I've lost any right to receive it. I am no longer a Eda to the law, that's why it's not right for me to receive it. This money has nothing to do with the law. I know, but Please, forget what happened. I will try to forget it as well. Besides, the money you give me... cannot help me go through the pain in any way. Nevertheless, I want to tell you... I'm most grateful for it. I understand. I'm sorry I've been late sometimes. Thank you very much, Sir. You know? I feel a little sad. When I saw you... Well,... I haven't felt that in a while. I don't know how to explain it... It's like we were relatives or something like that. I have I must go. Yes, sure. Take care. Take care of yourself. - Welcome home. - Hello. Thanks. It's been a long time. -It's a big hotel now. - Yes. - Miss Yumiko has arrived. - Welcome. - How are you? - A little busy at this time. How about you? How are you? A little thinner, aren't you? - Hello. It's good to see you! - Welcome home, Miss Yumiko. - I am going to live back here. - I am very glad. - Gene, show her to her room. - Yes. - Thanks, I will be right back. - No rush. That one is Yumiko. - Won't you introduce me to her? - When she comes down. Your old room is used for the clients now. Don't worry about that, I have come alone. - Yumiko - Yes? Listen, look,... I would like to introduce you to the wood inspectors. - It's - It will be only a moment. - Prepare the bathroom, would you? - Yes. Have some more. You didn't bring us here for nothing. We know each other. What things you say! Cheers! - This is the new part. - It's very pretty. Excuse me, gentlemen. Welcome you all. Allow me to introduce my sister, she has just arrived from Tokyo. - Her name is Yumiko. - Nice to meet you. I think she'll be the main attraction of the Shinoe hotel... from now on. Don't you think, gentlemen? What I think is that she is much more beautiful than you. I mean it. You are really bad! That gentleman is the boss. And the one seating next to him is Mr. Inohue. Mr. Inohue is the assistant director. Nice to meet you. Inohue is single, in case you are wondering. He's looking for a woman. No, not at all! He is the owner of the Yakiyama sawmill. He helped me a lot when I built the annexe. I had very little money... and nobody to support me. But he was very kind. We women are very weak. I often think I should write more often,... I don't know, tell them about the hotel,... but the truth is I almost don't have any time. It's ok. I understand... You have to run the hotel and that comes first. It's not easy to run a business without any help. You really mean it? Yes. Thanks. It knew you would understand, but I was afraid. His business is not going well lately,... and I do what I can to help him. But now his wife is spreading rumors about us. Then he is married? Yes, he is. And he has two children. But, well, someday things will work out for him... and then everybody will realize. Come on in, come on in. You can come in now. Well, if I may... Of course you may come in. Here you are. A little bit? - I prefer to eat something. - A tiny drink would do you good. - Come on. - All right. Tomorrow I must go to town,... I'll drop by the employment office. I'm a little short of personnel. I'm home! Good night Oh, drunk again! Your mother is here, she arrived a while ago. My mother? Mother, what happens? Why didn't you let me know you were coming? Your letter troubled me greatly. You seemed very disappointed and unhappy. No, no. How is my brother? Is he doing all right? Your brother is very well. - And the others? - Fine, all of them. I was talking to the house-keeper... She tells me that you come back late every night. Drink helps. What happens? Are you unhappy with the job? Your brother is worried about you,... he told me to ask you to come back home. He wants you to come back... and help him run the factory. Mother,... I'll start to send you money again next month. I can save 15,000 yens a month. How is that? She's come to see me, she doesn't want the money any more. I thought that I thought that she lived in Tokyo. Not any more. She has returned home. Shes at Towada Lake, in a hotel. It's very close. And I don't like it at all. If she no longer accepts the money, then, does that mean... that she finally forgave you? No, nothing of the sort. She wants to torture me even more. I don't think this can be solved with money. I want my husband back. But of course I will have to do something, because if not The money you give me cannot help me... leave the pain behind. Although I don't know what else to do. Please, forget what happened. I will try to forget it as well. I suffer too! Who can forget something like this? I think I should go to see her. I think I should go to see her and apologize. No, don't do it. It wouldn't do any good, thrust me. Poor son of mine. I can't see you like this. Calm down, it's all ok. Everything will work out. I will overcome this. Mrs. Yumiko, you have a visit. - Really? Who is it? - It's Mr. Mishima's mother. Mr. Mishima's mother? - Another drink. - No, thanks, thank you very much. - Come on, drink and listen to him. - All right. Honestly, I believe this time you are asking too much from me. You exaggerate. Somebody on your position can help me. If I own the forest, the business will work and everybody will win. Ok, I'll try. Go call Yumiko, tell her Mr. Inohue is here. - No, it's ok. I have to go now. - Don't leave! At least give her the present. I have only come to ask you to forgive my son. He came home drunk last night, like many others. It's been a while now... I see him very worried. He spends the night crying. If he found out If he found out I came to see you,... I'm sure he would get really mad at me. But I can't I can't see him suffer like this. I know words don't make up for anything, but... I ask you to forgive him, please. Look, everything is in the past now. Now if you excuse me Mr. Inohue is here. Don't you want to see him? Come say "hello". He says he's going to give you a present. I don't want presents. - I cannot accept anything from him. - Sure you can accept it. You'd help my man only by entering to say "hello". Just to salute him, eh? I won't marry again, you already know that. Don't be stupid, who is talking about marrying? You come? You are such a stubborn! All right, whatever. - You aren't mad? - Who is that woman? I'm sorry. - Have you already eaten? - Yes. Listen, Mishima. The manager called from Tokyo this morning and said that you have requested the transfer. Is that true? Yes, Sir. Excuse me for not having told you. You have given life to our office... and I thank you for that. Nevertheless, I also understand that you don't like to live in a small town like this one. No. It's not that. - Are you going out? - Yes. See you later. - Has that lady left? - Yes. Ok. Listen, I wanted to tell you something... The girls at the club give a party, would you like to go? The girls at the club? All the hotel owners are members. We give a party every year to drown our sorrows. - I really need to laugh. - That's what I wanted to hear. Let's have some fun, eh? Listen, Mr. Inohue is still here. Don't you want to see him? - You are stubborn too! - You didn't know that? Clients are going to be here soon. Receive them, ok? Wait. Let me serve you, I know what you drink. - Your sister told me. Come on. - Thanks. She also told me your husband died in an accident. Yes. - Water, please. - Yes. Mrs. Eda. Are you ok? I am not Mrs. Eda. I am Yumiko Shinoe. Yes, of course. Be careful. Leave me. It would have never imagined that I would see you here. I came to bring some clients. - They book here often. - All right. And I also wanted to see you. I, on the contrary, didn't want to see you. Your mother came to see me last week. She told me a lot about you. I'm sorry. It was all her idea. She explained me some things about you. That you have always been a good guy,... that you didn't cry at the hospital, that you are honest Why do we have to meet? I try to forget you and you show up again. Go away and don't come back. Go far away... so I don't have to see you again. Yumiko! Get ready, come on. - Have any clients arrived? - Mr. Mishima. Do you know him? Yes. Have this, drink. - And you? - Thank you very much. He's from Meiji commercial company, we have to look after him. His company receives many clients,... we have to make a good impression. But tell me the truth, where do you know him from? Tokyo. Don't tell me he's an old love... A national park is ok,... but you could have some geishas. What do you think? Am I right? Seriously, isn't there any geishas? No. Excuse me. So you knew Mr. Mishima in Tokyo, eh? In which part of Tokyo did you meet? How intimate have you been? - Could you bring more sake? - Yes. Don't run away now. Mr. Mishima,... could we say she was just an acquaintance? - That is right. - I doubt it very much. - Just visiting? - Yes. Thanks. See you later. Excuse me. - Have this, do you want some? - No. I have come to say goodbye. I've asked them to transfer me, as you wanted. I hope you feel better... now that I won't be here. Seat down. Look,... what happened to your husband was an accident. And I want you to know that although you don't say anything,... it will always be a heavy cross for me. I am the only culprit. That's right. After a time, you refused to accept my money,... you said that you no longer wanted it... because you wanted to forget the past,... but that's a lie, you enjoy torturing me. That's not true. I did it to forget. I wanted to forget everything, that's why I rejected the money. Why the cold stare then? Look, I wish you the best,... I would do anything to make you happy. You want me to go away... and you see, I go away. But your stare... is always torturing me. Mrs. Shinoe,... smile. Smile, please. Take care of my clients. - A coffee. - Yes. You forgot this at the hotel. I found it. Well, I thank you very much. I was drunk the other day. It did not mean what I said. I apologize. It's ok. When I got drunk the other night... I didn't behave properly either. How rude you are! - Pardon? - Nothing. It forgot this is your home town. People may seem a little coarse,... but they're good people, I can assure you. Yes: In fact, it's the same in my home town. Mr. Mishima. - The director is waiting for you. - Ok, I'll be right there. Before I leave... I would like to take a boat ride on the lake. Would you like to join me? Yes,... of course. Have they told you when you'll leave? Not yet, but I'll know soon. I am glad we have been able to meet like this. Have you heard about Nishino? No, I never hear about anything! Has anything happened to him? They transferred him to Lahore last year. The consulate informed that he disappeared a few weeks ago. They say he suffered a nervous breakdown. And disappeared? Well, he was completely crazy. The company wants to replace to him. They chose you. I would prefer to help it. Will I go to Lahore? It is a horrible place, it is in West Pakistan. A solitary office, and it's where the cholera come from. Two thousand people died in Dacca because of the smallpox. Since you demanded the transfer,... I did the impossible to make it happen. You have been a fool. You already have what you wanted. Drink. The order will arrive in a few days. You'll have to hold about three years in that place. -The bill. - Yes. Yumiko, do me a favor I already told you, I won't marry again. That's not it. This problem is mine. Your sister has fought with my wife again. It happens often, but She is too proud. That's me, there's nothing I can do, that's what she says. What do you want me to do? It's your fault, you are a married man. Is something wrong? I come from the meeting with the union, and I felt despised. Yes? And why was that? You should ask your wife. She spreads rumors about me. She's a bitch, a lizard and has no shame. She speaks of me as if I were a whore. She's going to find who I am. No, don't call her. Leave me! - Leave the telephone. - Leave me! She is going to find out who says the truth. I told you not to call her. Sister! - I must call her. - Stop! - You hit me! - Stop already, please! You are a revolting pig! Leave right now! Of course I'll leave! Pardon, would you mind changing seats with me? - What? - Would you change seats with me? Take another one. She is my wife. Well,... in that case Thank you very much. - Have you spent the morning in Aomori? - Yes. What a coincidence! - Would you like some chocolate? - No. What about some cookies? Peanuts? Gum? Are you feeling ok? I have temperature. Let's go to the shore. I 'm sure it's nothing. I'll ask when the bus arrives. There's still 40 minutes. Come, let's go. Where? To that hotel over there, we'll be fine there. They know me. No. Why not? You have to go home. We are at the other side of the lake. How am I going to go without the bus? It's starting to get cold. It will get worse here. Why are they looking at us? They look at us as if we were criminals. I don't know, we haven't done anything wrong. Don't pay attention to them. Come, let's go. No. It wouldn't take long before they started talking trash about you. That's not a big deal, don't you think? Come on, let's go. You are very stubborn. I was born like this, what can I do? That's your bus. Run and take it. If you miss it, you'll have to wait for an hour. Take it, please. I'm stubborn too. Ok. We better get some place to shelter,... but not the hotel; they know you there. Ok. Do you already know where they are going to send you? They said they will send me to another country. Abroad? But I believe that's very fortunate. Maybe I can be happy in another country,... leaving you unhappy here in Japan. There's still 15 minutes left. The temperature is raising. We better go to the hotel. You have very high temperature. Give him ice to keep him cold. Give him this every four hours. Temperature should begin to drop soon,... but it won't disappear until tomorrow. If something happens, call me. Thank you very much, doctor. Hello, Yumiko. What happens? He's fine. Ok. don't worry, but come back early. Hayashida is here. Be still! Hayashida says he's going to divorce his wife. But I don't know, we will see. You can't trust men. Stop already! Don't stay - You must leave. - Yes. You must leave. - Take it. - You must leave. Yes. Take it. You will feel better. You must leave. I'm very sorry. I am better. You must leave. Don't worry about me and get some rest. Try to sleep a little. Yumiko,... I feel as I were falling. Give me your hand, I'm falling into an abyss. I'm sorry, I can't eat anything. Well, take the medicine. It's been four hours. And the bus, what time does it get here? In twenty minutes. - Can you walk? - Yes. You haven't slept all night, have you? Don't worry. - I'll sleep when I get home. - I'm sorry... I caused you so much troubles. I'll be transferred... to Lahore, you know? To Lahore? I won't be able to thank you for what you've done before I leave. But, you have already made up your mind? Yes. I thought they would send me to Hokkaido... and finally they didn't. In Lahore there is cholera and other diseases. Nobody wants to go there because they're afraid of getting it. That is not more than a legend. It is a modern city now. How do you know that? In Tokyo I used to talk to some neighbors... who traveled a lot... Lahore, Dacca, Laos,... Saigon, Karachi They always said you couldn't go to those places. Well, that was before, now things have changed. I believe this is what I need,... maybe I will be able to redeem myself this way. I don't understand how come Yumiko has already decided to choose a man. Inohue will feel disappointed. I believe you are the one disappointed. Don't be a fool. - I am here. - Hello, Yumiko. Listen, come here. I didn't tell you everything when we talk. What happened exactly? My friend wasn't feeling ok. - Your friend? What friend? - Mr. Mishima. Mr. Mishima? Ah, the one from Meiji commercial company, right? Yes. Then, you two are No, we are not lovers. We could never be. You never know, don't you think? I do know, because he took everything away from me. - I cannot love him. - What did he take away from you? He's the one who killed my husband. He was? Was he the driver who ran over him? Do you think I could love that man? And now if you excuse me, I'll go lie down. Inohue can still have hope. - Good morning. - Ah, good morning. - What train are you going to take? - I haven't decided yet. And what are you doing after the celebration? To drink, I suppose. I'll go out to see my clients, ok? Listen, if you don't want to be alone tonight, I would love to... Tell Mr. Kawai that I will leave tomorrow night. I suppose he'll like to know in advance. What you are doing? Oh, I'm sorry. I scared you, didn't I? I'm sorry. You are a bad boy. - What were you thinking about? - Nothing. I wish you had said you were thinking about me. I see you feel ok already. Yes, I'm ok now. Thank you very much. Could you give me some water? I'm thirsty. Great! The sky is so blue. You are really a bad boy. There's some of your lipstick on the glass. - But I'm not using any lipstick today. - No? Then I brought you a present. - It's from Tokyo. - Thanks. I needed it. Herbs? Let me help you. This is kogomi, right? It is Shidoke. - And this one? - Kogomi. Summer is nice. It's my favorite season. - Yes? - I wish it will never ends. After summer comes winter. Winter is nice too. You are funny. The truth is I like everything:... winter, summer, sidoke, kogomi Everything. - Do you already know when you'll leave? - What? I leave in a few days. - What are the herbs for? - To make preserves. Preserves? Now we make preserved fruits and other things. We save them for the winter. I think we are a little like badgers. In autumn snow starts to fall and it covers everything for 5 months. Even buses can't go around. We lived surrounded by snow... until spring melts it. It is a problem. No, it's not. Why? How will I be able to come with so much snow? I'm sorry, nobody can come. Only the mailman gets here once a week to bring letters. Once a week? If he comes once a week, Ill come twice. No, three times. I will come to surprise you as I did now. You had a beautiful smile,... you seemed a little girl. Although, you are very sensual too. Do you want to go? Could you give me some tea? Yumiko,... I think you already know. You know I love you. Why do you say that? - You're going far away from here. - That's why I say it. I can only think about you. I haven't stopped thinking about you... ever since we were in that hotel. We must go. Yumiko, come to Lahore with me, please. No. Lahore is a horrible place, nobody wants to go there,... ...but I promise I'll make you happy. - I'm sorry, go away. Don't live in the past, you have to get over it, you have to be happy. Please. And don't come back. I have to be in Tokyo the day after tomorrow, we can't separate like this. Think it throw. We can't erase the past from our minds. I think you're giving too much importance to common sense. - Listen to your feelings. - I cannot go with you. How could I go with you? If we made such thing,... we would have to live ashamed for the rest of our lives. - Don't you realize? - No, really. And I don't understand. It would be too cruel. I couldn't bear that cruelty. - Yumiko - You have to leave. Please, go away. Good bye. Good morning. Is Hayashida there? I would like to speak with him. He's not there? But he said that He's gone away? Where? Hello? Hello! Excuse me. Good morning. Is Hayashida there, please? It would like to speak with him. I understand. Thanks. - What do you think? Do we do it? - Kill ourselves? No, thanks. Have they found the bodies? Good morning. Is Mr. Mishima, please? Yes, I understand. No, don't bother. Do you know what time he leaves? Nine thirty? Thank you very much. This is your fault. - Really? Why? - You already know why. No, I don't. Tell me why it's my fault, come on. Mr. Mishima, come down, you have a visit. Well, what happens? An accident. - Welcome. - Do you have a room? Yes, come on in, please. My love! My love! No, please! I'm so sorry. Excuse me. The bath is ready. Serve dinner, please. Yes, Sir. Whatever you say. I'll be right back. Forgive me. I rowed with you in Towada Lake,... I collected herbs with you in the countryside,... I let you take care of me when I was ill I am the one who should apologize, it's my fault. Because I loved you. Let's drink. Come on, you too. What do you want to toast to? Don't be sad. At heart I am a Barbarian,... I prefer Lahore to any European city. Do you know what I'm going to do? I'll sing you a local song, as a farewell. They say anyone who listens to this song... reach happiness. I am sure you will be happy.
