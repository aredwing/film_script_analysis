A weaIth of creatures that grace every nook and cranny of our beautifuI pIanet in numbers that may never be truIy known in their entirety! Some, masters of the heavens above; caretakers and heIpmates of the earth beIow; watchfuI eyes and ears throughout recorded history, and beyond! Living shouIder to shouIder with peopIe, whiIe others Iive soIitary Iives in their naturaI environment. And then, there are Pokemon who form vast communities; aII expressing Iife in their own unique way! Setting off Iargerthan Iife, breathtaking forms with equaI majesty in miniature, the worId of Pokemon truIy is a worId of wonder! Capturing the fantasy of many, incIuding a certain young man who, aIong with his partner Pikachu, is battIing his way to attain the titIe of Pokemon Master! A journey of adventure, hard work and training, shared with friends; with new friends around every corner, and new experiences at every turn. Case in point, the newest adventure - dead ahead! The Space-Time Rift. And there, a reaIity exposed- heretofore unheard of! Poised to redefine the undiscovered, and the mysterious. Two entities that never shouId have met, cross paths in the Space-Time Rift. This iII-fated meeting has brought forth their unbridIed wrath, enveIoping the city. And as a resuIt, aII is coIIapsing. What couId be the true meaning of this horribIe nightmare? Godey's diary, huh? Wow, what an interesting find! It appears our Heroes have found themseIves a beautifuI day on which to continue theirjourney! Ash's quest for Pokemon Mastership is shared with Pikachu, Dawn and Brock, whiIe aII quest for excitement. And the next site of both quests is the Pokemon Contest Iocated in AIamos Town! ShouIdn't we have gotten there by now? AImost. And there it is! AIamos Town, right over that hiII! I'II bet ya, as soon as we get there, we'II find some great battIes! Pikachu! I've got to get ready forthe Contest. So many dresses to wear and so IittIe time! Huh, hoId on! Looks Iike we're on the wrong shore! Huh? Pika. And I'm exhausted. Me too! WouId you aII Iike a Iift? Huh? Pika. Hi there! We can't thank you enough for your kindness! So, my name, dear, is Brock. WouId you honor us by teIIing your name? My name's AIice. So it's AIice from AIamos Town! I can't beIieve I don't have you written down in my IittIe bIue book of babes. SiIIy me. Aah, I'm such a dummy! Huh? There's onIy one thing to do. Let me take you out! After Croagunk takes me out. Pikachu! Now, my name's Dawn. I'm entering the AIamos Town Pokemon Contest. Hi, I'm Ash. And this is my partner, Pikachu. Pikachu! Awesome, we're reaIIy movin'! What a pretty Iake! Yeah? Not as pretty as AIice! You're quick. He's used to it. Pika. WeII, I work part-time as a hot air baIIoon tour guide, but I aIso spend most of my time as a music student! Huh? Leaf whistIe? Pika! You see, the Pokemon are showing me which way the wind's bIowing. Okay, Chimchar. Say, this baIIoon thing is catching on! Like we're gonna catch Pikachu! More baIIoons? Three DrifIoon and a DrifbIim. Ah-ho, they're so round and cute! Say, I think they want us to take them for a waIk. Come to Jessie! WiII you pIease stop pIaying hard to get? What did I do? Same thing ya aIways do. Okay now, a IittIe humor wiII go a Iong way to stop that sweIIing! They busted us with Gust! We're bIasting off again! Look at those towers! The Space-Time Towers. Here, Iisten to this! The briIIiant architect, Godey, designed the Space-Time Towers 100 years ago. And that's where we hoId our Pokemon Contests, Dawn. Oh, wow! Hundred years? That's Iike 10 years times -- Times 10. You're right! Let's see. It expIains why they're caIIed Space-Time. The tower on the right represents time, and the one on the Ieft represents space. Hey, I couId've toId ya that! PowerfuI forces coIIiding with each other. Something big's going on. Is everybody okay? Yeah. What was that? I suppose it couId've been the air currents. But it sure was strange. Sorry if you guys got scared! I know what; I'II give you the grand tour! That'd be great! Pika! This has got to be my favorite pIace in the whoIe town! This whoIe garden was designed by Godey, you know? What a beautifuI spot! It says: The design theme of architect Godey's briIIiant garden is the harmony between humans and Pokemon. I've been pIaying in this garden ever since I was a IittIe girI. So everyone here is my friend. CooI! Everyone, Iet's go! Great idea! I'm in too! Come on out! Guess that's their way of weIcoming us. Knock it off! Stop fighting! What a beautifuI song! My grandma taught it to me. It was just so moving! Thank you, Brock. GaIIade -- What, GaIIade? GaIIade, gaII -- gaII. What happened? GaIIade, gaII -- gaII. Something's very wrong. Chimchar! Guys, Iet's go too! Return, now! GaIIade, gaII -- gaII. This is terribIe! Who couId've done this? It was Darkrai! Huh? AIberto! It appears there have been recent sightings in town. Uh, excuse me. Who's Darkrai? The Pokemon who wreaked this havoc. Pokemon? Darkrai must Iive here in this garden. I've heard of Darkrai before. It's a Pokemon that makes you have nightmares. Nightmares? Handsome hunk spotted in cIose proximity to Pikachu! Looking Iike a Joe we shouId get to know! Never hurts to rub eIbows with a rock star, I aIways say. Huh? Hearthat? Darkrai. LickiIicky, Hyper Beam! Huh? Now what did you do that for? Huh? Tonio! You okay? Uh-hmm. This is my friend, Tonio. He's a scientist. I was investigating a space-time abnormaIity that I had detected. Something has happened. It isn't possibIe. No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine, reaIIy. AIice, you don't have to be so nice to him. AIberto. After aII, my dear, you are to be my wife, remember? -- No way! -- Huh? Excuse me, but I thought I toId you no aIready! Come on, I'm too young to think about marriage. PIease forgive me. This isn't the time or pIace for that kind of taIk. Now that that's done, why don't you come over to my pIace, for a IittIe dinner? CooI it. AIice is so not interested. Excuse me, young Iady. Butt out! Tonio, who is that guy? Baron AIberto. So AIice, Iet's get going. Huh? Huh? You see, Tonio's the one I Iike. Uh, I am? You have quite a sense of humor, my dear. So, this was aII just a IittIe joke. Joke? Umm. Oh AIice -- Not again. What is it? Such strange phenomena. Something's there! Do not come here. It's Darkrai. I'd say so. Ahh! Darkrai? 'Fraid so. So it was you after aII, Darkrai. Go LickiLicky! Ooh! What's that? That's Darkrai. What a nice-Iooking chap. What? It's gone! Huh -- huh? Hey guys -- Pikachu, where are you? Hey! Brock! Dawn! Oh man, what's goin' on? Aah! Huh? Darkrai! Darkrai's doing this. AII right, Turtwig, I choose you! Aah! Huh? Hey, Pikachu! Pikachu! Pikachu! Huh? Pikachu. Pika pi! You're okay! Ash, stop! Pikachu's suffocating. Huh! Where am I? The Pokemon Center. You were having such terribIe nightmares after Darkrai put you to sIeep. Nightmares, huh? That means it was aII a dream. Creating bad dreams is Darkrai's speciaI abiIity. If you ever faII asIeep near Darkrai, you'II have terribIe nightmares. You were reaIIy in a bad way. You woke me up; didn't ya, buddy? Pikachu. Darkrai doesn't normaIIy come out when peopIe are around. So I don't think the townspeopIe are Iiking this one bit. Because of aII those nightmares, even the other Pokemon stay away from Darkrai. WeII, no one wants to have a nightmare, right? If I ever come across that Darkrai again, I'II give him a battIe, but good! Wait. Remember, it was Baron AIberto who attacked first. This is an incredibIe force, enough to actuaIIy warp space. Huh -- I have to Iook at more data! Tonio? There's a strong possibiIity the same thing has happened before. That must be it! Maybe there's something in Godey's diary -- That is so him. Once he starts thinking about something, that's that. That's AIicia. She met Darkrai in the garden. AIicia -- AIice's grandmother! Rose red -- Luxray! And so, Darkrai, who was hated by everyone eIse, opened his heart to AIicia and began to Iive in the garden. Oh, what an amazing story! Huh? Hmm -- It turns out that the nightmare toId me just what I needed to do. For the future, I needed to Ieave Oracion for the worId. Huh, Oracion? Hmm -- T.V. peopIe, eh? That's us! And being the great Baron that drove away the eviI Darkrai, an interview with you wouId be quite a coup! Conducted by me, the IoveIy reporterette JessiIina! Directed by yours truIy Jamison, and photographed by Meowth; now that's a name! Hmm. WeII, I suppose. After aII, the pubIic does have a right to know. Thanks for the pubIic service! I'II take that one, pIease. Of course. This Lunar Wing wiII make bad dreams a thing of the past. So, come again! No need to worry about nightmares now! Man, I sure hope that thing works. Hey, is something bothering you, Ash? And this is the site of the AIamos Town Pokemon Contest. I am so psyched! I can't wait for tomorrow! Oh! The Towers are just as impressive inside, as outside. And we're right in the middIe. This is the Space Tower, and this is the Time Tower! The architect Godey who designed the Space-Time Towers was Tonio's great grandfather. Tonio's Iaboratory is directIy beIow us. Tonio? It's AIice. Sorry to bother you. Wow! Tonio? Tonio! Are you aII right? Huh? Oh, AIice! Good morning. WeII, don't sIeep on the fIoor. Sorry. I found a reference to the nightmare in Godey's diary Iast night. Wish I couId have a nightmare. Huh? Hah? Not onIy that, I found a picture of your grandmother. It shows her with Godey. Grandma AIicia. Looks just Iike you. It's music. Huh? That was a nice save, I guess. Pikachu. What're those? Music disks. Excuse me? That's how the tower's music is abIe to pIay. Oh, can I try it? But, to do that, we'II have to waIk aII the way to the top. No need to worry. Me and my big mouth. Come on, move it! Run! Race ya to the top, Dawn! Pika pika pikachu! Oh man, me and my big mouth! Pika -- The onIy way to fIy. Hey, that's not fair! Sorry, but you were fast! You can cIimb. Hey, Iet us on too! Pika! Godey buiIt the Space-Time Towers as a beacon of hope for the happiness of peopIe and Pokemon. The happiness of peopIe and Pokemon. And here's our very own beacon of hope now! FinaIIy! Pika pi -- NormaIIy, it's set to pIay automaticaIIy on the hour. But if there's something speciaI you want to pIay -- You put in the disks you need. Great! Hey! I wanna do that. No way. This was my idea. Umm. Pika. Then push it down. Brock, wouId you mind? Not at aII. You see, this Tower is the worId's Iargest musicaI instrument as weII! Wow! Pika! You know, baIIoons rock! Pika! Huh? Pika! Ah, if it isn't Ash! So Iet's battIe again. I need someone to pIay with Torterra. Torterra. Come on. Me too. Sudowoodo! BuizeI! Sudowoodo! Let's go! Pikachu, get movin'! It's coming from a different space. From between the dimensions! What was aII that? The sky just Iit up! Go away! Huh? Huh? Darkrai! Ah ha! LickiIicky! Leave it to the brave Baron to find Darkrai in a fIash! With such daring and dash! There is no escape. AII right, LickiIicky, Gyro BaII! Dark Void! GibIe, no! Sudowoodo! What in the worId is that? It's Darkrai! Quick BuizeI, use Water Gun! BibareI! Pikachu, use ThunderboIt! My neck! You saw that, right? Pika! Huh! Quick, Pikachu, use ThunderboIt! Okay Pikachu, now use VoIt TackIe! Look Darkrai, the onIy one Ieavin' here is you! No, I stay. What? Huh? Let me handIe this. Darkrai is mine. Baron! LickiIicky, use Hyper Beam! LickiIicky! Get up LickiIicky! This is no time for a nap! Again? What's that thing? Huh? An uItra-rare Pokemon? That fIies through waIIs? It can't be reaI. Maybe so, but -- care to expIain what you're up to? WeII, what? The camera does add a few extra pounds. B-b-b-b-b-buh Baron! Spit it out, I say! Man, I must be havin' another nightmare. Pikachu, I want you to hurry and wake me up! My royaI tongue! Nurse Joy, I think I couId use an exam too, hah -- It's these haIIucinations! But I'm seeing them too! I guess you're aII stiII a IittIe shook up. I think you're right. Guys, we've got a probIem! We've got a probIem here too. Huh? Huh? ReaIIy? WeII, excuse me, peopIe. But you don't even know the meaning of the word probIem! Since when can LickiIicky taIk? I am not LickiIicky. I am the Baron AIberto! No way! Quick, Tonio. Turn me back at once! You act Iike AIberto. He's teIIing the truth. He turned into LickiIicky right in front of us! Pika pikachu. And us! We saw the whoIe thing with our own -- beady eyes! Here's the reaI deaI as proof! The reaI worId merging with the dream worId. What are you taIking about? AII of these Pokemon are dreaming that they're being chased by something frightening. And what about me? I guess LickiIicky must be dreaming that it turned into you. Say what? The space around our city is being acted on by a powerfuI force, creating a space-time anomaIy, resuIting in aII of the strange things we've been witnessing. But why? I don't know. It's that Darkrai! Every time it appears, strange things happen; don't you see? Perhaps. LickiIicky, you must wake up this instant and go destroy Darkrai! Hey guys, what about our in-depth report? We ain't got enough depth to fiII a kiddie pooI! Look, first we get Darkrai, and then, we'II dig deep. Huh? Listen peopIe, we're stuck! It's the craziest thing! We're trapped in town, and we can't Ieave. Now Honchkrow, Defog! Defog didn't do a thing! No matter which way we try to escape, we aIways end up where we started! I'II be back! Pikachu -- Pika! But I know we ran straight. Pikachu! It's that Darkrai! No doubt up to one of its eviI tricks. And nothing's going to change untiI we destroy the nasty demon. It's nice to see Baron LickiIicky back up to speed. Baron AIberto! Oh, my makeup! Pokemon trainers, Iend me your ears, your strength and your expertise. We must destroy this Ioathsome and eviI Darkrai. And now, foIIow me into the fray! Right! What do you think? They need us. Yeah! They need us too! Yeah. Hmm. HoId on. Huh? AIice? The truth is, I don't think Darkrai is behind any of this. What? But, it must be Darkrai. No, it's a bit too earIy to be certain. You see, back when I was a boy, AIice and I were pIaying together in the garden. Tonio. Huh? Yoo-hoo! I'm up here. Come on up and pIay with me. It's dangerous up there. Look where you're going! Don't worry, I'm fine! AIice! Huh? Huh? Hah -- Huh! Huh? AIice, are you okay? Say something. AIice! Tonio. Oh, you saved my Iife, Tonio! Uh -- Tonio, I Iove you! But the truth is, I didn't save AIice that day. Now I'm sure of it. It was Darkrai who saved you that day. Oh, Tonio! Godey's diary aIso says that it was your grandmother AIicia who opened up Darkrai's heart. I don't beIieve that Darkrai is eviI, either. Then why is Darkrai fighting with everyone? Pika pika -- Something's keeping everybody from being abIe to Ieave town! I don't have aII the answers yet. For now, we just hang on. We join the venerabIe Baron LickiIicky and his posse of Pokemon trainers as their quest to destroy Darkrai gets into fuII swing! That's Baron AIberto. There it is! Huh? It's Darkrai! Let's see. These space-time anomaIies began occurring after Darkrai appeared. But at this point, the nightmares hadn't yet materiaIized. It didn't take Ash very Iong to wake up. Soon after that, Darkrai appeared in the square. After that, that's when the nightmares materiaIized! Hah -- Now I see! That has to be the defining event! What's this? Infernape! Mach Punch, go! EmpoIeon, use Ice Beam! Torterra, BuIIet Seed now! Darkrai's in a bad way. CouId this be the end? Do not interfere! Infernape! No, wake up! That move was simpIy IoveIy. I mean, Darkrai's eviI rampaging must be stopped. And since there's no one better to Iick that brute, why don't you? You do strike an imposing pose. I guess I couId take advantage of the situation. I've got it, and I'm going with it! Go, Gyro BaII! Then it's wrap! Huh? Not bad. We're bIasting off again! Look at this! Aah! Hey, that's the same thing from my dreams! Look cIoseIy. I'II digitaIIy enhance the image. Oh my! PaIkia! Isn't it? Yes. It is said that PaIkia Iives between dimensions and ruIes space, a Pokemon that's been caIIed a deity. A deity? When the garden was turned into a wasteIand, it was a sign of PaIkia's appearance. Do not come here. Darkrai sensed what was about to happen. It was at the moment when the sky Iit up that PaIkia burst into the city. But Darkrai was the onIy one who saw. Right. Go away. Darkrai said that's a PaIkia! Pika -- And that's just what Darkrai was trying to teII me, in my dream. About PaIkia! So that means PaIkia's here. But where's that? Here! Is that -- Darkrai! Darkrai, no! That's PaIkia. Oh my! Pika -- Go away! BuizeI -- Houndour! BeIIsprout! BeIIsprout! AII right! I'm me, wonderfuI me! Enough for one day! The town is fIoating in another dimension. BuizeI! Sudowoodo! Everyone's awake. Of course. PaIkia transported the town to another dimension. So when Darkrai's nightmares became fixed in its unstabIe space, they acquired materiaI form! It Iooks Iike PaIkia's hurt. What's that? Darkrai! Huh? Who's that? That's the Pokemon said to govern aII of time. DiaIga! They're both considered to be deities. Hmm -- Huh? PaIkia and DiaIga must have battIed in between dimensions, and so the wounded PaIkia must have fIed here, seaIing the town in yet another dimension. Attempting to hide itseIf from DiaIga! Two entities that never shouId have met, crossed paths in the Space-Time Rift. Their unbridIed wrath has enveIoped the city. And the resuIt? Destruction! What do you mean? The nightmare that I read about in Godey's diary, it's happening here and now, right before our eyes! Wait. You're saying Godey was dreaming about future events? Yes. Tremendous energy! Everyone okay? Yeah. Guess so. AIice, wait! Stop fighting right now! Darkrai! Go away! Darkrai! Darkrai, you aII right? AIicia -- My name's AIice. You see, AIicia was my grandmother. AIice -- You tried to protect ourtown. I'm sorry I didn't understand. Yeah, me too. Pika -- Darkrai, forgive us. Darkrai, no! Check it out, guys. What's happening? It's the town's perimeter waII. It's begun to coIIapse! If we don't act, everything wiII disappear into another dimension! This kind of bIasting off, we don't need! But, what can I do? Hah! It turns out that the nightmare toId me just what I needed to do. For the future, I needed to Ieave Oracion forthe worId. But it didn't say what Oracion couId be. Oracion? AIice, you've heard of it? Yes. Oracion is the name of the song my grandmother taught me to pIay on the Ieaf whistIe. That's it! Godey foretoId the disaster threatening the future and Ieft Oracion for us. The Sound Disks? Uh-hmm. Oracion, the song with the power to soothe the fiercest rage. There's no song named Oracion in the research Iab. But, it might be -- here! But, which one's Oracion? There are so many. It's caIIed Oracion. Oracion? That's right. It means prayer. My mother taught it to me a great many years ago. Umm -- Promise me you'II aIways remember it. Sure. Oracion means prayer. Remember. That's it! Got it! Let's hurry to the Space-Time Towers. Right! Chimchar, Iet's go! That's it. Move into the garden as far as you can. And don't push. Take it easy, and stay caIm. Ready? Way to go, Croagunk! The evacuation's nearIy compIete. I'm going to wait with the others at the rear of the garden. Good. I'II handIe things here. Thanks, Brock. [ Skipped item nr. 839 ] But Ash and Dawn -- PipIup, no! Staravia, Iet's go! Now, Chimchar, Iet's get moving! ExceIIent work. Tonio, oh! Huh? Oh, Baron. I owe you thanks as weII. I'm over here. Huh? Aah! Not again! Turtwig, Aipom, watch my back, okay? Dawn, Iet's go! Right. Here it comes! Way to go, you two! Darkrai. Darkrai, you aII right? Are you hurt? Are you in pain? Oh, you are. I'II heIp you. AIicia, make you weII. Huh? Oh no! HoId on. BuizeI, Water Gun! Buneary, Ice Beam! Perfect! Great! CarefuI. Pika pika. Stop this right now! You don't have to Ieave, you can stay here. Do you mean that? Of course. You can stay here for as Iong as you Iike. This is everyone's garden. Oh no! If those two coIIide one more time -- our dimension is through! Stop! This garden is everyone's! Darkrai. The disk! Let's hurry! Hey, come on! Darkrai's bIocking the expIosion's energy, but -- for how Iong? BuizeI, thanks a Iot! Hey Pikachu, take care of everyone! Pickachu! Huh? Ash, come back! Darkrai, no! But how? I am not gonna Iet Darkrai down now! Pikachu! Pika pi. It won't fit! This is it. If those two coIIide once more, then it's over for aII of us! Huh? But Ash and Dawn! PIease get there in time. This is Oracion, isn't it? It must be. Try the one in the middIe! Hah! -- It's in! AII right! The power. It's dead. Too Iate. Pachirisu, discharge! And Pikachu, use ThunderboIt, fuII bIast! That's it. That's Oracion! PaIkia, can't you see what you've done? You've destroyed the whoIe town. AII the Pokemon, you bring this town back to the way it was! You've gotta do it! PaIkia, pIease! We're back! Thank you, Darkrai. For everything. I'm sorry, Darkrai. I shouId've known you were just trying to do the right thing. Pika. Pikachu. Darkrai! Darkrai, you're okay! Pika! I'II aIways remember you Carry your dreams UntiI they come true Each breath that I take Each moment away I'II aIways remember you Everywhere I waIk I see your shadow And when I cIose my eyes, I see your face Every song I sing, I hear your meIody Because not a moment that goes by And you're not on my mind You wiII aIways be my hero Never scared braver than us aII Guiding Iight for me to foIIow AIways showing me the way Right beside me everyday I'II aIways remember you Carry your dreams untiI they come true Each breath that I take Each moment away I'II aIways remember you Oh oh yeah, I remember Hey yes yes I remember Oh, forthe sacrifice you made And aII the gifts you gave I'II aIways remember you Carry your dreams untiI they come true Each breath that I take Each moment away I'II aIways remember you you you I'II aIways remember you I'II carry your dreams untiI they come true Each breath that I take Each moment away I'II aIways remember AIways remember I'II aIways remember you
