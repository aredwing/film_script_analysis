Get another one, I'll see you again tomorrow. - Oy, faggot! Did your mum get fucked by a horse, Swifty? Is that what's got bothering you? - You're a fucking tramp. - Don't drink that, mate. Seen the state of his lips? You'll have something on that. - Your mum's a mong. - Your dad, yeah, is an inbred retard. Look at me. Is an inbred retard, yeah?

Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! - Fuck off me! - Fenton, Swift, Headmaster's office now. - Fuck off. - Oh, yeah, big boy. Go on. - Dickhead. - Go on! - His team leader administered his medication. - Why do you use this stupid language? To make me feel intimidated? Well, I'll tell you something. I don't feel intimidated by you. I've had two kids through this school, and you've failed both of 'em. - You have to look at the bigger picture. - Where's he gonna go now now you've kicked him out? 'Cause nobody else is gonna take him, are they? - Mrs. Fenton, if we both speak at the same time, neither of us will hear what each other is saying. - Well, I've heard enough from you. - I don't think mainstream school's the right place for him. I'm sorry. Is there anything I can- - No. You've been excluded permanently. - Sick. - Arbor! - He's been excluded for 10 days. Lad's got concussion. He had to go to hospital. That's what he said. You need to get an education. - It's all right, Mum. - Our Arbor were protecting him. Arbor stood up for him. - Didn't mean for him to get into trouble, Mrs. Swift. - I'm sorry, love. - Brilliant, eh? Don't have to go to school. I can go out scrapping and make some money. You coming or what? Guess what. - Are you joking? - No. - We're like fucking right divs with that. - We got to start somewhere. Come on. - Oh, my God. - Come on, then. - Smell you from round the corner, Swifty. - Go fuck off, you. - Fucking stink, you. - Oh, there's a pan there. Watch that lot so it don't get nicked. - Oy, Swift. Did you lose that baby or did your dad sell it? - They'll be worth something, won't they, Swifty? - Take that. - Yeah. - Leave these. - Yeah, yeah, ain't it. - Take these bits as well. - Oy, what the fuck are you doing? - What does it look like? We're scrapping 'em. - You're fucking not scrapping 'em. I'm fixing 'em up and selling 'em. - Seriously, you're fixing them up? Don't fucking think so. - Who the fucking hell do you think you are, eh? Coming round here and thieving my fucking stuff. - Get away. He's me mate. - Hey! Now fuck off out me sight, the pair of you. - Shut the fuck up. - Go on and take your fucking shitty pram with you. You fucking get in now. - Fenton, you thieving bastard! I'll break your fucking legs! It's your brother. Look. - We look like fucking smackheads. - Oh, well. - We look stupid, Arbor. - Doesn't matter if we look stupid, does it, though? We're not stupid. Just going out to earn a bit of money. Know what I mean? Got about 3 quid there or summat. We'll bang halves. That's sick, mate. - Look at that. - That is massive. Bradford massive. Bradford massive. Wicked, wicked. - Fuck me! Hey, come on. Hurry up. What? - What's this crap? - Aluminum, that. Hang on. And a bit of brass. - Right, dump that over there and help them lads get bright wire out of that lot. - All right. - Steve. - Swifty, get wire out of that. - Hey, what time do you call this? You got to be back by 5:00 for weigh-in. Hey, what's with the face? Do you want to go round with a pram like them two divs? 25 quid to hire the horse and cart. - I thought it were 20. - Yeah, well, you thought wrong. Price of copper's gone up. My price has gone up too. - Tight bastard. - What did you say? Pay up or fuck off! If you haven't got the money, you can't take him out. Simple. Now turn round and see to fucking Diesel. What are you looking at? Get on with what I asked you to do! - You lads working for Telecom? Thought you worked for Railway. - Right, what you got for me, lads? - We got bright wire, legacy cables, unmarked, untraceable. - Poly-sheathed cable. - Processed? - Aye. And 40 of these. 10 kilo copper bales. - What are you giving? - I reckon 21/2 grand, tops. - Fuck off. 31/2. - 21/2 grand. - 31/2. - If you took it in and weighed it for 3, it'd be no less. Weigh it in then. - Fuck weighing it in. - Hey, you two. Get that barrow and bring it over here. 21/2 grand. - And put fucking kettle on. 31/2. - Fucking hell, Swifty. - Come on. Bring that barrow over. - Ay, don't forget your fucking pan, kid. - 49 armored. Add it all up. Take it to the back. Give us your pan. One of ali. - And one of brass. - Aye, he's a good trotter. - The best. - Yeah, well, everyone you ask got best, haven't they? I've had a lad training Diesel. He's fast, very fast. 5. That's for you. - Ta. - Hey. And that's for you. - Ta. - Hiya, Mick. You all right, lads? - Bye-bye. - Bye, darling. 2,960. That's one... Two... 2,960. All right? - Hey, ya. How you lend a horse and cart for me and Swifty and we'll bring you back some proper scrap? - You've no experience. Fuck off. - Hang on. Hang on. His granddad used to be a rag-and-bone man. - You should be at school. - I hate school. I'm a fucking scrap man, me. - Nah, nah, nah, listen to this, mate. He's a proper grafter, this one. - Does he ever shut up? - Are you up for it, then, Kitten? Chip 'n' Pin v. Diesel. Sunday, A-65. - Course. - Let's have a look at him, then. - Who? - Shergar. Who do you fucking think? Diesel. Come on. - All right. - See you later. - Come on. Here he is. - Whoa, here we go. - Hey, hey. Hey. hey. What are you doing, you bloody idiot? Come here. Come here! Come here! - Steady. Steady. Steady. Steady. Steady, lad. Steady, lad. Steady. - Good lad. - Steady. - He's fast. He's fast, you know. - Going backwards. - Oh, fuck off. - Or with a rocket up its arse. - What the fucking hell were you doing, doing that? Come on, Daniel. Come round here, now. Daniel. Daniel. - Are you nervous? You're sucking on that fag well enough, aren't you? Do you think you're up to driving this horse or what? Because if I don't think you are, I'm gonna have another few quid on... - I don't think he's gonna win. - All right, do you not? - Nah. - 50 quid on Diesel. 50 fucking quid. - Anybody else want a bet or what? - Hey, Kitten, he's shit himself. - Finish line, this. - Yeah! - They go under here full go. It's sick! - Yeah! - Come on! Come on! Come on! - If Diesel wins, Kitten'll be loaded. - Come on! - Get your money ready, Kitten! - Go on! Go on! - Come on! - Go on, Diesel! - Go on, lad! Go on! Go on, Diesel. Good lad! - Come on, Diesel! Go on! - Diesel's in the lead! - Go on! - Go on, Diesel. Go on, lad. - Come on, Daniel! Get up there! Get back, you! - Fuck off, man! What are you doing? - Keep up, Daniel. He can't see the car! He's got his blinders on! - Get off me, man! Fucking hell. - Daniel, get up there! - You're spooking him! He's gonna get him hurt. - Come on! Get back, you fucking asshole! - Stop pulling him back! Give him his head. Send him! - Fucking hell, you! Get back! - Go on! Keep going! You can do it! Go on! - Get up there! Come on! Come on! - Yeah! - Fucking bastard! - Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - What? What? What? - What the fuck were you playing at? - Weren't my fault. A car got too close. - I'll have your balls off. - It's that horse. It's spooked. - Don't blame it on my fucking horse! - It's mental out there. - Out of my sight. - They're all laughing at you behind your back. Laughing at you playing a hard man, when all you are is a fucking wannabe Gypsy. - All right, all right, all right, all right. Come on. Calm down. Don't let me ever see you again or I'll fucking kill you! - We'll work for you. - Get my horse in that box. - Let me drive him for you. - Swifty, we're gonna be scrap men, us. - Ain't got no money. - Well, if you haven't got the money, we have to take the settee, love. - Ain't got settee, neither. - Well, where the fuck is it, love? - Where's this come from? You've been grafting, ain't you? I want better for you. If you're to get on, you've got to go to school. - I'm excluded. I'm not supposed to go to school. - You're breaking me heart, love. If you show 'em you're sorry, they'll let you back in. - How much did you get for that scrap? - Nowt. - You must have got something for it, you lying bastard! Fucking lying little bastard. - Is he coming out? - He's not here. He's at school. - School? - He's better off there than hanging round here with you. - I stuck up for him, though. Stuck up for lot of you when people were ripping you. - What's he still doing here? - He's been excluded, but he comes anyway. - All right, Cheech? Where's Chong? - Leave him alone. Come here. What are these? - Oh, from yesterday. You weren't here and some good stuff came in. - Yeah, well, it's still got to be accounted for. You know, we've got to be careful. The laws are tightening up. - Should be out there watching ports, not wasting time on us. What's that? - Can I finish yoking up Tommy and go out scrapping for you? - Sod off. Come on, give me a chance. - Stop mithering us. I said no. - Then Tommy'll just sit there all day. I've seen a batch of cable. I could get it for you. - Keep it above board, love. - Have to be processed. You got 25 quid? - I got 20. - Would you like one, love? Oh, no, not him. Stop. - You've been excluded, Fenton. - Easy now. - I'm calling security. What are you doing sat here, you daft twat? Let's get out and make some money. Come on. - You got that bridle too tight on that horse. - Let me come sort it out for you. - You're a bad influence, Fenton! - Go, go, go. - Go, go, go. Go! Go! Giddyap, Tommy! - I know where we can get some cable. Make this horse go faster, will you, yeah? - Yah! - Put your backs into it. - Thanks. - There you go. - Good work, boys. - Pry that motor out now, then. - All right, then. There. It's out. Worth quite a bit. Copper wound, that. Hey, come on, hurry up. They haven't seen you. Let's smash this on the cart. Got to burn it off, ain't we, 'cause it's marked. - Sound like Kitten, you. - Piece of cable like that, length and width of your arm, probably about 500 quid. - Don't even think about it, Arbor. - Steady. - All right, lads, where's your pushchair? - Fuck off. - Much better load than you had last time. - Good scrap, this. 200 pound a ton. - You reckon? - Yeah. - We'll have a look. - I know. - All right. It's better than last load anyway. Do you just want to take it round there? - Here are. We burnt all casing off and removed all SmartWater dye. - 37 on that? - Yeah. - All right, Arbor love? - Yeah. - 240 quid. That's all right, ain't it? - Gonna go check on this horse. - Yeah, whatever. - 2, 3, 4, 5... There you go. - Ta. - Hey, do you want your docket? - Yeah, please. - There you go. - Thanks. - Hey. - What are you doing? Get off. - For tax. You're under 16. Got to tax you at source. - Idiot. - What you doing? - Swifty! 110 quid there. That'll sort your mum's electric. Buzzing. - Sick, eh? What are you gonna spend yours on, then? Buy a new settee and that? Yeah. - Here are, though, Swifty, yeah? Just don't let your dad get his hands on it. - No, I won't. Oy. - Hurry up, Swifty. I want to get off. Reckon we could get that cable off that pylon? - It's too risky. - Think of money, though, Swifty. Oh, come on, man. I can't do it on me own. - Oy! Swifty. - All right, Kitten? - Meet me first thing, 6:00 a. m. I want you to have a go at driving Diesel on road. See what you can do. All right? Get in. - What's the point in a trotting horse? They can't pull a cart. - It's well soft, this one. - What? Shut up, Swifty. You're soft, you daft bastard. - Give us a footie on. - God's sake. You better not have shit on your shoe. Oh, your arse is on me head. - Hurry up and stop mucking about. - Get off! There, you're on now. Right. What the fuck's happening here, then? There you are. - It's like a fucking advert, isn't it, eh? - Summat worth nicking here. That your new dosser, Kitten? - What, are you gonna get him to finish that job Daniel couldn't do, eh? - He'll not be able to shift it either. Lad told me cable chamber is still isolated. At least 4 grand of copper down there. - Make yourself useful. Get cable and put it in fire. Risk to reward ratio's in our favor then. - Not on that job it ain't. What? 132,000 volts? You'd have to be mad or desperate or stupid or summat to risk that. - Where you off? You're never up this early to go scrapping. - No, I'm off to drive Kitten's horse this morning, aren't I? - What for? - Arbor! Where's your kiddie coke? Where's your fucking pills? - Oh, shit. What's he doing? - Get the fuck off! - Where's your money? You got money? Give me your fucking money! - Get the fuck off him! - Give me! Get off! Get the fuck off me, Swifty! Please, mate, please! They're gonna do me if I don't pay 'em back. - I hate you. I hate you! Fucking prick! - Fuck off, then! - Who invited you? - Are you gonna let Swifty drive in the race for you? Well, are you? How do you make money from a race? How much is Diesel worth, then, eh? 1 OK? 20K? If he wins in race, he increases in value. Bet you could sell Diesel for thousands, isn't it? - Shut the fuck up. He's good. He's focused. - I could do that. - Oh, could you, heck? Takes skill, that. - Whoa, boy. - Whoa, whoa. - You done good, Swifty. You done good. Handled him well. - Can't half boogie, can he? - Aye, he can boogie. You had a good feel for him. - Yeah, I thought it were gonna be a bit hard, but it came back quite nicely. - Hey, Diesel, good lad. - Give us a bit of this. Well, open it, then! - Hey, what are you, his dosser? You shouldn't be drinking that shite anyway. You're hyper enough as it is. You need tranquilizers. Bugger off. How were his mouth? All right? - Yeah, thought it was gonna be a bit hard, but he's easily pulled back, isn't he? - Aye. His girth all right, not too tight? - Yeah, he can breathe. - Hey! Where are you going? Where the fuck are you going? Come back here now! Fucking get down there! Come back! - Steady. - Arbor! Whoa, Diesel, whoa. Steady, lad. - Stay away from my horse! Turn him round. 15 grand's worth of horse. Fucking idiot. - Fuck! - Yah! - Mum? - They were looking for Martin 'cause he's been nicking off people. - Every time I try to get us out of trouble, he just gets us deeper in it. Where is he? - Laying low. His dad's, I think. - I'll sort it, Mum. - How can you sort it, love? - Make some money. Pay off his debts. - No, Arbor, you're a kid. - Come here, Mum. - Bastards. I'm having that. Ah, just got electric shock. I'll bench you above me head. - Ah! - Watch yourself. Whoa, watch it. You nearly took me arm off. Don't mess about there now. - I'm not messing about. - Go to sleep. - No way. Get away. Not hard enough, mate. - Yeah, I am. - You're not. - Come here. - Don't- - Give you a little dig with it. - You wouldn't dare. Let me give you a little dig with it. - No. - Here are, then. Just in your arm. - No. - Don't be tight. - Don't be tight? Let me give you a dig in the head. - Give me a dig in arm if I can give you a dig in arm with it. - No, 'cause your digs-Ah! You're crushing my foot! - Don't try and test me. You can't test me. - Stop squashing me foot, then. Mum, bizzies. - Fuck's sake. I'm sick of lying for him. They'll raid his dad's flat. He'll kick him out. He'll come back here. And I'll get me windows put through again. I've had enough now. Maybe a spell in jail will do him good, sort him out. He can detox and all. - Can still get it inside, Mum. - How do you know that? - Everyone knows that. - He ain't here. I've kicked him out. And don't ask me where he is, 'cause I don't know. - We've come about Arbor Fenton. - I don't think so. - Heard he had a bit of trouble. - It's all sorted now, thanks. - You should take your shoes off. Shoes off. - This is a formal interview under caution. Do you understand that, Fenton? Hey, do you understand? - Yeah. - A witness saw two youths burning railway or communications cable. - That's nowt to do with him. - Cable theft is a very serious crime, Mrs. Fenton. Trespass on the railway is 1,000 fine. - I ain't been on railway. - Vandalism. Endangering lives. Maximum penalty of life imprisonment. - He's just a kid. He ain't nicked no cable. You're looking at wrong place. - He is, as you say, Mrs. Fenton, a minor. There's unscrupulous people out there getting kids to do their dirty work so they don't get into trouble with the police themselves. - I do look out for him. - Is that it? Go on, then. You can put your shoes back on. - See ya. - Bye. - You heard what that policewoman said. That Kitten is using you. I don't want you going down there no more. - Mum, I'm gonna make a lot of money. - I said I don't want you going down there no more. - For God's sake. - Don't do that. Can't you see it's pulling on the corner of his mouth? How would you like it if someone did it to you? - Fuck off. You think you know it all, you. - Hey, what are you doing here? I told you, I don't trust him near Diesel. Now get back. Stay back. Have you yoked him? - Yeah. - Right, come on, then. Bring him round. It's all right. All right. You done? - Yeah. - Come here. You all right? - Yeah. - I want you to drive him in re-match against Micky's horse. - Me? - You can do that? - Yeah. - It's a big race, Swifty. Don't let me down. Win and Diesel's worth big bucks. Lose and he's worth nowt. Get off my car. - Get in. - He'll just keep money from race, you know. How's that gonna get your mum out of debt? You're just lining his pockets, you know, Swifty. He's using you. We won't be able to move this. - Course we will. - Will we fuck, man? Are you mad? - Right, take some of that stuff off, and that, though, gut it out. - These won't come off. - What won't, that? Go on, pull it. Job's a good one. See that? It'll be easy. Go on. Get started. Let's just keep stripping it, and we'll be able to do it. - You don't even know what you're doing. - Course I do. - Daft cunt. Be able to get all roof off and that at this rate. - How are we gonna put that on there? - There's a way. - Is there, fuck. - I got wheel off. - What you want me to do? Shit Smarties? Fucking car! Pull it, girl. Pull it. Pull it. - Get yourself off the field. You're gonna kill that pony, lad. - Fuck off and mind your own business. - Hey, ya, I need some boys that'll be able to lift a car on that cart. I'll give yous a fiver. - I'll do it. But I want a tenner. - All right, all right, Kevin. A tenner. - I'll do it for a fiver. - You can hardly stand up, mate, let alone lift a fucking car. - Yeah, go on. I'll give you a lift. - Go on, now, get out. - Fuck off, you smackheads, fore I wrap a pool cue round your head. Fucking twat. - Well done, lads. - Sorted. - Getting too old for this job, me. - Come on! Move over! - Fuck off, wankers! - Move out the way, you pikeys! - Wankers! - Put it by light iron! - Sweet, Tommy. Good boy. - Where you going? - Pay point. - You owe me 25 quid for the hire of the horse and cart. Value of burnt-out car? Fuck all. Now get back out there and earn it. - Robbing bastard. Fucking hurry up! I want to get out of here! He's a bastard, him. We don't need him. I'm gonna get that cable off of pylon and all. Come on. Move. - Shouldn't we do this down at Kitten's? - Why am I gonna go down there? He's a muppet. What's the point? We're here. - Where are you gonna get paid up here? - Take 'em down to another scrapyard. Not going down to Kitten's again. - Where the fuck have you got all them from, Arbor? You've chorred 'em off, Kitten, ain't you? Arbor, you're gonna get your head kicked in. - 15 bales. 600 quid. - You've got to understand, I'm dying to run that race. - Yeah, and I know you are. I'm dying to get some money for us both. Why's you a dosser? If you don't stand up for yourself, Swifty, you'll never have owt. You'll always be a poor bastard under someone else's thumb. - All you're bothered about is metal. - All you're bothered about is horses. You're soft. You need to harden up. Oy, what's that? Side of that bin. - Whoa, steady, Tommy. We'll go weigh in now, yeah? - Hang about, man. I want to do something first. Go on. You think it's live? - I don't know. I wouldn't risk it. Wha-what you doing? You were gonna test it on that foal, weren't you? - Get off. - You're a fucking psycho, you. - Get off! - Have your drugs stopped working? How would you like it?! - Swifty! Swifty! Get off! - Get off! Swifty! - Here you are. - Hey, you can't bring that horse in here. - I've come all the way from Bradford. - Well, you're a daft bastard, then, aren't you? - What am I meant to do with that lot, then? - Go on, sling your hook. Go on. - Fucking dickhead. - What the fuck are you doing, Arbor? - Hey! Hey! Isn't that Kitten's horse? - He'll fucking mince you, mate. - They won't let me in scrapyard with horse and cart. We'll do you a favor, eh? We'll take scrap in van, get it weighed in for you. We take a cut. You get the rest. - All right, then. - Good lad. Come on. - You nicked this off of Kitten, didn't you? This is the stuff I brought in. Ah, what do I care, eh? I got paid for it. Take a cut now, I get paid for it twice. That's for nicking my railway cable, thieving little twat. Fucking hate you, Arbor. - Come here. Come with me. - You owe me 1 grand. - Mick took money. - Too fucking bad. Those bales were marked, you stupid little twat! Put it to widest setting, Swifty. Get off! - Come here. Come here. Give me your hand. - Get off! - Come here! - Get off! - I'm gonna take your hand off, you thieving little bastard! Come here. - Swifty! - Don't fuck me about! - You're gonna replace that copper you stole off me. Look for a concrete block over a manhole. That's cable chamber. Take chain off. Put them boots on. Zips. Take these off before you start. Now go. Fuck are you looking at? Go and see to Diesel. - Come on. Shit. - I came for Tommy. Make sure you were treating him right. You killed that foal. - I don't even know what you're on about, Swifty. - You're a fucking mental case! Course you did. You're out of control. - Did you grass me up, though, Swifty? - No, but I wished I had've done. You fucked it all up, Arbor. - Well, if you hate me so much, then how come you've come back, huh? - 'Cause I'm thick like everyone says. I'm soft, aren't I? - Swifty, wait there. Listen. I swear down on my life I did not do it. I need your help, Swifty. Please. - Well, get behind it, then, or we'll never shift it. Giddyap. - Fucking hell. - Oh, shit, Arbor. - I'm fucking shitting myself. - Fuck's sake, Arbor. Move. - Here you are. You need gloves. Here you are. Swifty? Swifty! Swifty! Come on. Swifty. Steady. - Fucking bastard! Kill you! - Get off him! Fucking get off him! Get off him! Get off him. - Let go of him! - Fucking bastard! I'll fucking kill you! You killed him! - Grab his legs. - Ah! Get off! Get off of me! - You twats! - Get him in the cabin. You bastard! - Oh, no. - Fucking bastard! - Calm down. - Fuck off! Fucking hate you! - Don't say owt. - Fuck off! Fuck off! - I made him do it. It were my fault the lad died. - Step down, mate. - She doesn't want to see you. Hey, it's me. - You all right, bro? You all right? You gonna come out? Arbor, come on. I'll make you a brew. We'll go and- We'll go and have a kickabout or something. What you say? Play a bit of footie? Arbor, seriously, mate. Mum's really... really worried. Please come down. Please. Arbor, come on. Stop being a dick. Please, mate. Oy, look at me at least, bro. Arbor. Mate, please come out. I don't want to drag you out. Mate, come on. Come on, bro. Mate, don't, please. Don't struggle, 'cause I'm gonna have to drag you out of there. Come on, please, get out. Arbor, come- Come the fuck out now. Get the- Get out, Arbor! Fucking hell! - I appreciate it, love.
