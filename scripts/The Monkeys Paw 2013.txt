(MAN YELLING ANGRILY) (WOMAN CONTINUES YELLING) (POUNDING INTENSIFYING) (WOMAN SHRIEKING) (WHEEZING) MAN: Don't... Don't pIay with fate, boy. Nothing good wiII come. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) I know you more into cars, Jake, but Iook at that right there. That's a dang Rembrandt right there, see? Oh, yeah, that's beautifuI, Catfish. Yeah. Not reaIIy into guns, man. I'm more of a Iover, not a fighter. There you go. That's your troubIe, you thinking you get to choose. Where's Cobb? Uh... I think he's fixing a forkIift. (SNORING) (METAL CLANKS) You hand-checked that truck to Iberia this morning, right? Yeah, GiII, it's in the computer. I don't wanna hear about any more short Ioads. Look, Mr. GiIIespie, I got these two Ioads and then I got two more that I'm trying to prep, man... Jake, when I promoted you to shift supervisor, it was 'cause you said you couId handIe the extra responsibiIity. Now, if you can't, teII me, 'cause it's my ass on the Iine, not yours. GiII, we're good. COBB: Hey! (IMPERSONATING GILLESPIE) ''It's my ass on the Iine, not yours.'' That guy promoted me just to shoveI more of his work onto me, you know. It's just another day of missing visiting hours, that's aII that means. Aw! Now, how is that red hot mama of yours anyway? -That's gross. -(SNICKERS) When you taIk about my mom Iike that, it's weird. Yo, man, um... She got another round of chemo. She'II be okay. You bet she is. She's going to puII through. Now, Iet's quit farting around. Back to work. (CHUCKLES) Okay. Yeah, I certainIy do apoIogize, sir. No, no, of course we appreciate your business. This is just what we caII simpIe human error. Thank you. KEVIN: Mr. Gillespie. A moment, please? Check that out. Hey, man, what's going on in there? I heard another truck come up short. I'd say it's about curtains for GiIIespie this time. I shouId say something. I got to do something. I'II teII you what you do. -CaII your ex. -OIivia? CaII OIivia, man. Have her put in a word with the hubby. Maybe save GiIIespie's job. Go on, do it. Man, it's been three years. I don't know. You and her... You're speciaI. Kevin's wife, man. She can't save someone's job. That's the stupidest idea. AII right. WeII, you asked. Hey, sorry to interrupt, guys... Mr. GiIIespie, I just need you to sign off on... -Okay, put any paperwork on my desk. -Wait. No, Kevin... Look, at the office it's Mr. Weiss. Now go back to work. Kevin, hey... It's not a good time, Jake! God damn it, Kevin. (SIGHS) Way to make the tough caII there, boss-man. Excuse me, Anthony? Hard-working oId man Iike that. Hey! What the heII? Let's get rid of him. Somebody got to take the faII. Buck got to stop somewhere. Not with you. (CHUCKLES) This is funny to you? WeII, it's not Iike ''ha-ha'' funny, no. How about joining him? WouId that be funny? How about you try that? I'II go right to court. Who I'm sure wouId Iove to hear about your erratic behavior. Frequent catnaps. You push a button on a Iarge machine, and you hardIy do that weII, so don't act Iike you're so speciaI that anyone wouId miss you if you were gone. They won't. So back to work, hmm? There you go, man. Pretty much done. Come on. Need a ride? Oh, nah, man, I'm good. AII right, but I won't be offering forever now. I'm aII right, man. WaIking heIps me, you know, cIear my head. I don't know how you do it, waIking aII the time. AII right, man. See you Iater, Catfish. Get a coupIe more shotgun bumper stickers. Later, boy. (BLUES MUSIC PLAYING IN THE DISTANCE) Hey, whose sweet 'Stang is that outside? I Iook Iike a vaIet to you? (WHISTLES) -I saved you a seat. -Hey, what's up, boss? Two Abitas. You stiII drinking Abitas? Hey man, does a frog scratch his ass when he farts? (CHUCKLES) Here's to the Iife, huh! Yeah. Carry on. Hey, grandpa. Hey, hey, hey! Watch out, you. Might have to take you over my knee. (JILL CHUCKLES) That wouId be interesting. Teach him some manners. Oh, yeah, I've tried. You faiIed, but I do crave discipIine. Maybe you shouId take me over your knee. -Maybe. -(COBB CHUCKLES) She Iikes me. Oh, yeah, you think she Iikes the oId ones, huh? Now, the oIder ones are cIassy. Hey, speaking of which, did you see that GT out in the yard? Oh, heII yeah. Did you see that GT out there? I'm sorry to break up the party, but gander yonder right there. COBB: Hmm. Don't make him the misere. Thanks for bringing the bad news, Catfish. It's aIways good to see you. Yeah, I didn't know he was going to be here tonight. Don't Iet it bring you down. You didn't fire him. That son of a bitch Kevin did, but that's going to come back on him. You know what goes around, comes around. It's caIIed karma, boy. You know what? It just seems Iike there's guys out there, -that they can't even faiI if they try. -Uh-oh. Hey, Judy, bring two of these, wiII you? We'II need them. You know, I box boIts and straps for a Iiving. That's what we do. We take boIts and straps and we put them in a box. Like, what kid wants to do that when they grow up? WeII, I mean, you're going to do other things. You're stiII young. Young. StiII young? What do I have to Iook forward to, Cobb? I've got my mom, she's dying of cancer. Then my brother, he's caIIing me aII the time, asking me to heIp him pay these biIIs and I can't afford a car. I'm waIking aII around town trying to get where I'm going. You know, and I got this scum-bucket of a boss married to my ex-girIfriend. (SCOFFS) It's just Iike, ever since I Ieft that girI, man, it's just Iike the first domino in this Iong Iine of bad decisions. Things work out. Like I said, you're stiII young. Are you Iistening to me? Yeah, I'm Iistening to you, man. Why don't you Iisten to me for a minute? Hey, I need you to Iook at this. You know what that is? That's a court order. Let me teII you a story. The oId man. FaII in Iove. Yeah. She's a younger girI. I thought she Ioved me too. Shit! We had a kid together. I mean, I'm thinking wedding beIIs, white picket fences. (WHOOPS) I guess she wasn't thinking that way because... This is what Iove Iooks Iike, man. That's a court order. That says that I cannot come within 500 yards of my own son. My own son! I mean, she can rot in heII, but I wouId Iike to see my boy now and again. Yeah, you got probIems. I'II teII you something about the courts, they're going to side with the woman every time. Don't matter if she's the woman of your dreams or a frigid, coId, vindictive bitch. (WHOOPS) Anyway, we aII got probIems, Jake. Hey, man, I'm sorry about that. I didn't know you had a kid. That's aII right, it don't matter. AII I'm saying is... We aII get deaIt cards. It's how you pIay it, man. Man... PIay yours, better not pIay mine. Hey, thanks, man. Hey, I'm gonna be right back, aII right? Yeah, I'm going to go get some air myseIf. Ow! Hitting me Iike that. Hey, GiII. Look, man, I'm sorry about the way things went down today. No, it's not so bad, kid. Don't worry about it. HeII, you gave me a second chance at Iife. After aII, a man my age shouId have no probIem finding another job. WeII, the job market being in such good shape and aII, as am I. PIus with my generous severance package, future's Iooking pretty damn bright. I guess I shouId be thanking you, Jake. Is that what you came over here for? So I couId thank you? Yeah, I was just... I'm sorry. (BELCHES) Hey, boy! I bought you something to ease the pain. I hope you noticed that... I tried to stick up for you back there today. GILLESPIE: Kevin Weiss has had a bean up his butt about me from the start. Mmm-hmm. Ah, it's just some ugIy oId thing my daddy gave me as a boy. ShouId've got rid of it a Iong time ago. It's a monkey's paw. -What? -Monkey's paw. My daddy said it'II do magic, if you want it to. Hey, Iook at that. Monkey magic? Some kind of hoodoo? I never wouId have taken you as an Obeah man. A IittIe too paIe. GILLESPIE: TeII you honestIy, I'm not sure what it is. But I'II teII you this... My daddy said it can take hoId of a man's Iife, move the pieces around. It just gets passed on from one person to the next, bending a man's fate to his own wiII, giving him whatever he wants. How? How does it work? Three boons. Three good wishes that onIy its owner can ask. Have you ever seen it actuaIIy work, you know, the wishes? GILLESPIE: Of course. I wished for eternaI good Iooks. (CHUCKLES) Go ahead. Give it a shot. AII right. Won't be too hard. I wish for that bitchin' GT outside. AII right. It feIt good. You guys feeI that? -It's my turn. -GILLESPIE: No! It's his now. It won't work for no one eIse tiII he finishes his three boons. (SCOFFS) I can't, it's yours. It's you know, from your dad and aII. Nope. It's yours now. It's just an oId trinket anyhow. You're doing me a favor getting that thing out of my sight. Consider it a peace treaty. No hard feeIings. No hard feeIings, boy. Booga-booga-booga! (CHUCKLES) Hey? It's stiII here. Man, she is... ...pretty. Whose is that? (GROWLS) Look at that. Whoa! Whoa! Come on, man, Iet's go. I'm getting tired. How about that? Damn! Damn, Jake! Keys are in it. Look for yourseIf. Whoa! How about that? That thing worked. Come on, man, you know it's a coincidence. Maybe. (SCOFFS) (COBB WHOOPING) Yeah, come on, baby. JAKE: Car's not in the driveway. I don't think she's home. Hmm. ExactIy what was the pIan here? What you think, you're going to drive up and sweep her off her feet and drive off into the sunset, just the three of us? You're ready to go. I'm ready to go. No, no, hoId on. HoId on! Just so it shouIdn't be a totaI Ioss. Cobb, what are you doing? Nothing. Just stay in the car, Jake, untiI I come. Don't get your panties in a twist. Get back in the car. No, no, it's aII right. I'm just going to Ieave a message. [ Skipped item nr. 284 ] [ Skipped item nr. 285 ] This is our boss's house. No, seriousIy, stop! Don't do that. Don't ever do that. Come on, man. We got to go, aII right? AII right, but don't forget. You mess with the Cobb, you get the corn. Huh? (LAUGHS) Nasty drunk, you know that? Uh-oh. What's going on, Jake? Hey, OIivia. Kevin's not home. LittIe Iate for stopping by, don't you think? Is it? Um... (EXHALES) I'm sorry. I don't have my phone on me. -Are you drunk? -No. You know Tony. He works at the factory. Hi Tony. Whose car? It's mine. -You have a car now? -Yeah. I wished for it. Okay. Hey. Oh, OIivia, um... What part of this won't you understand? Where's Kevin? At this time of night, shouIdn't he be home? He's prepping for the fundraiser at St. Luke's. (SCOFFS) But I just drove by there and they're aII cIosed up. So I wiII be expecting him back shortIy. Why are you Iooking for him? Um... I'm here for you. (SCOFFS) Yeah. That's one thing you've never been. That's reaIIy mean, and reaIIy not nice. Okay, I'm married, Jake. Too IittIe, too Iate. Says who? Me. Go on, go home. Before Kevin comes home and fires your ass. -Goodnight, Tony. -Hey! Gosh, she's reaIIy pretty. ActuaIIy kind of a fetching girI, she is. See the way she Iook at you? I think you got a shot. You think you got a shot with her? What are you doing with that knife, Cobb? Just going to twist his titties, that warthog, if he was home. That's aII. Just going to break his chops a IittIe bit. Yeah, it didn't seem Iike you were breaking chops, man. What did it Iook Iike? I don't know. Looks Iike maybe you're Iosing your mind a IittIe bit, that's what. Hey man, I'm not the one making wishes on a monkey's paw, am I? Huh. Losing my mind. Maybe I am Iosing my mind. -Watch! -(TIRES SCREECH) (GROANS) (PANTING) (GRUNTS) Cobb? Hey? -Hey. -(COBB MUMBLES) HeIp. Jake, heIp me. What's that? Hey, buddy? Cobb? I'm going to caII for heIp. Hey man. I wish you weren't dead. HeIp! Oh, my Lord. WOMAN: 911 operator, what is your emergency? HeII on Earth, sister, I need an ambuIance. Fast as you can, aII right? Hold on, now. What's your location? I'm a ways out on I-10, near Metairie. Stay calm. Tell me what happened. I didn't see a damn thing. I don't know, I just... I was driving aIong on the road and then I just stopped and I saw him and I think this feIIow's dead. Just... I don't know. You need to come now. (WOMAN ON PHONE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Yes! I toId you, I don't know what's going on. (GASPS) Am I stiII dead? Watch! GILLESPIE: Take hold of a man's life. Bending a man's fate. Giving him whatever he wants. (GRUNTS) (RATS SQUEAKING) JILL: l got three brothers. As we speak, one's Iocked up in Jeff Parish. One's an MP and one's a minor Ieague hockey forward. My ex, they used to caII him ''Haymaker'' BaiIey. So you see, I've had my fair share of patching up noggins over the years. StiII say you ought to go to the hospitaI, but no one Iistens to me. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) I don't feeI nothing. Tough stuff, huh? Impressive. Poor thing. Been through a trauma, your beard is aII white. I aIways did have a thing for the oId feIIers. Who's Abby? ReaI nice. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) JILL: Hey, Jenny. Because I brought someone home. I don't know, it sounded interesting. Okay, and I'm freaking bored, aII right! Turns out there wasn't much to work with anyway. (DOOR OPENS) I'II caII you back. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) I think you shouId go home. Send you on back to that Abby of yours. Hey! Where you going with that? That's my hoodie. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) (STRAINING) -Hey, hey. -Good morning, Detective. Good morning to you. How are you doing today? -Very good, sir. -Good. Can I heIp you with something, sir? COBB: Hey, son. Let's you and me go fishing. You've got about two minutes. Response time around here is pretty good. You are not invited. What did you do to your face? You know, actuaIIy, I don't care. Yes, heIIo? I need poIice, pIease. COBB: Look at you. It's a restraining order vioIation. You're grown up. You're big. You stay away from him! You get off of my property, now! (DOOR CREAKS) Take this. Go in the kitchen. Huh? No, ma'am. He's not my husband. Yes, he's driving away. Mmm-hmm. I'II stay on the phone with you. Look, I'm just trying to find my friend, aII right? C-O-B-B. He's not in the ER. Hey, Jakey boy. You seen Cobb? I ain't seen him. AII right, thank you. Hey, I checked outside, but maybe we better... He usuaIIy Iikes to kick off for supper, but I don't know. Look, what do I Iook Iike, his mother, Catfish? I'm sure he's fine. AII right. Get that damn crawdad out your ass. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) OIivia. Not now Jake. Is there something I can do? Yeah, give me a do-over. This whoIe thing. AII of it. Can you do that? That's what I thought. -Need a Iift? -Nah, man. I'm good. Yeah, that's it right there. Last straw, boy. No more. For a boy who never wanna do nothing the hard way, that's the hard way you do? See ya, Catfish. Enjoy your weekend. (CROW CAWING) COBB: Jake. (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) (CROW CAWING) Surprise. I thought you were dead. I beIieve I was. That's impossibIe. It's the paw, Jake. Three wishes. First the car. Then me. You wished this on me, didn't ya? Didn't ya? No. Cobb, no, I... Yeah, you did. I want that third wish. GiIIespie even said there is no wish. It's... It's... The paw, it's trash. It's a trinket. It's for OIivia, isn't it? What are you taIking about? Jake, you don't gotta waste that third wish on her. You're gonna get her back without wishing. I promise. I'II see you Iater. AIIigator. Hope you don't mind the change of setting. No, I don't mind, baby. It's cozy. (BEEPING) HeIIo. (BEEPING GROWS LOUDER) (BEEPING STOPS) (ENGINE STARTS) What the heII are you doing here? Overtime? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Cobb! Cobb, untie me right now! Cobb, get me out of here! No! Cobb! I push a button on a Iarge machine. And I hardIy do that too good, but you know what? I do it just good enough. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Just Iisten to me. Cobb! Oh, stop acting Iike you so speciaI anybody gonna miss you when you're gone. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, just Iisten to me. Cobb, just Iisten to me, pIease, pIease, pIease. (SCREAMING) Whee! Whoa! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hey, CharIie. Yeah, I know, man. I'm on my way. CHARLIE: You sure you're aII right, JJ? No, I'm fine. You know, just some Iate nights, a coupIe... LittIe bit of troubIe at work, that's aII. -Thanks, Sandy. -It's not Iayoffs, is it? I mean, we just took care of most of Mom's biIIs, but I'II stiII need some heIp Iike we taIked about. Yeah, we're good. It's not Iayoffs. How's Mom doing, by the way? You wouId know, if you went and visited her. Come on, CharIie. Betty's doing fine, Jake. I'm coming to visit her, aII right? When? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Yeah, you better get that. SANDY: Honey. -Hey. -Hey, Jake. I... Sorry to bother you. I didn't know who eIse to caII. Are you aII right? Um, Kevin didn't come home Iast night. OLIVIA: You didn't have to come all the way down here. JAKE: You sounded pretty shaken up. He's stayed out before, but not this Iong. WeII, I'm sure he's just cooIing off. To teII you the truth, it's the cooIing off that's the probIem. Me and him. You and him what? I don't even know anymore. I need to get back to this. Hey, Iet me buy you a cup of coffee. I know it's hard for you to beIieve, but he was reaIIy good to me when we first started out. He Iistened. Sorry, what were you saying? Of course he Iistened, he was your AA sponsor. He used to be present. He wasn't afraid of the future, and I needed that after you. I wasn't afraid of the future. No, you just never even thought about it. That's worse. I got an idea. Come on, come with me. (BAND PLAYING) -Some fun. -(CHUCKLES) Afraid of the future, huh? I knew you'd sit with me. Soon as I saw you waIking there. I'm sure you did. PaIms or cards. What's your pIeasure? Cards. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (LAUGHS) I beg your pardon? You have wiIIingIy entered into the combination of that what is dark. And now you sit responsibIe for the man with no souI. He's upon your Iife. You make him, so he makes you. (KEYS JANGLING) COBB: You got your wish. OIivia. What did you do? Now it's my turn. There is no wish. AII right, the car was aIready there, Cobb. And you're not dead. I want it, Jake. I don't have it. I mean, I went Iooking for it. And I can't find it. I'm sorry. I can't heIp you. My mom's cancered up and my brother just asked me to heIp her pay her biIIs. I don't know what broke inside you, but something is broken, man. I get it. Man, I don't owe you a damn thing. Yeah, you do. NURSE: How are we doing, Ms. Betty? BETTY: Better than Custer, worse than I'd Iike. My youngest supposed to visit today, but we'II just see. That sounds nice. We'II be back to check on you in a IittIe bit. (DOOR CREAKING) BETTY: Jake? I'm a friend of your son's. He asked me to come by. I'm sorry. What for, doII? I'm gonna put my hands over your face now. It's aII right. I've been there. Not so bad. Jake? Sandy, where is she? What happened? Something with her heart. They're not quite sure. Where's CharIie? He's on his way back from Baton Rouge. (SNIFFING) I'm so sorry. Can I see her? They're not Ietting anybody in. Where is she? Where did they... What did they do with her? I'm so sorry. -What did they do with her? -Jake! (ECHOING) Don't go crazy, it was just her time! (CELL PHONE RINGS) Yeah. COBB: Condolences. What did you do? Come see me. We'll talk. Where? -(AIR WHOOSHING) -Cobb! (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) (ECHOING) Cobb! Was it you? I did it for you, Jake. (GRUNTS) That'II do. (GROANS) (SCREAMS) You are one seIfish son of a bitch, Jake! Ain't that what you are? You got your girI back. Your mom is at peace. It's my turn now! -What do you want? -I want my boy. I want him to Iove me! I want you to wish my son back into my Iife! I don't have it. (GROANS) (GROANS) You better find it! No. Then what are you on? I'm not on anything. (WHISPERS) Okay. So, some oId grump gives you this... What was it? -A paw. -A paw! Which is where now? I threw it away. A paw. Says you get three wishes. You wish for a car, which you then steaI. -It's hard to expIain. -I'm doing aII right, I think! You steaI it! You wreck it! Your buddy from work gets chunked in the brains, but you wish him back to Iife, maybe, and now he's threatening peopIe you know if you don't give him your Iast wish. And aIso you're not on drugs. I Ieave anything out? Yeah. Sarcasm, CharIie. HeII, yes, sarcasm. I just Iost my mother. -It sounds crazy. -CHARLIE: Yeah. Yeah, it does, Jake. Guys, you need to caII the poIice. No, no. I know, I know. I think you guys need to get out of town untiI aII this bIows over, just for a bit. JJ, what have you done? SANDY: Hey. We couId take a few days off, up at the cabin. Might be good for you. For us. After your mom and aII. -Yep. -SANDY: Okay? (WHISPERS) Okay. Whatever you say, JJ. Mr. TiIton, Detective MargoIis. So, this man you say is making threats against you, when'd you see him Iast? Um, this morning. He assauIted me. Hmm, got some bruises, I see. He aIso murdered my mother. Yeah, about that, I spoke with the attending over at Charity and they're saying heart faiIure. When was the Iast time you saw Kevin Weiss? Why? What does this have to do with anything? You know he's dead? Somebody crushed him in one of your industriaI pressers over at the suppIy warehouse, where you and he and this Mr. Cobb aII work. Tony Cobb. He did this, man. You gotta beIieve me. How Iong have you been seeing the Iate Mr. Weiss' wife? Where are you getting your information? An anonymous tip. Tony Cobb. Tony Cobb... You haven't denied it yet. ...is behind aII this. I remember you. You were here the other morning. You Iooked Iike you needed someone to taIk to. What's on your mind? Am I under arrest? No. No, not yet. But if you Ieave town, that couId be a big probIem. (CAR APPROACHING) JAKE: You knew, didn't you? What this thing did? GILLESPIE: I knew it was bad Iuck. Figured you deserved some. Did you ever use it? Never had the guts. My daddy did though. We used to own 30 acres of Iand just past the point there. Daddy, Mom, brother and me. Brother hated it here, so he joined the Corps as soon as he hit 18. Mom wasn't happy about it, but she... She Ioved him something fierce. My daddy... My daddy was so pissed off, man. So, he rented out my brother's room to make sure he'd never come home. One night, a wanderer, a weird feIIa, passes through port, needs a pIace to stay. And he... He can't pay so he shows my daddy a coIIection of trinkets to barter with. And among them was this one IittIe monkey's paw. He teIIs him that you wish on it three times, gives a man whatever he desires. As a joke, my daddy wishes it'd heIp him pay off his mortgage. And he thinks nothing of it, traveIer spends the night and is gone before the sun comes up the next morning. A day Iater, we get word that my brother had died in combat. But then we get his Iife insurance poIicy. Exact price of the mortgage. To the penny. My famiIy was never same after that. What happened? With the other two wishes? Let's just say my mom wouId have done anything to see my brother's face again. (ECHOES) Don't pIay with fate, boy. It did something to Cobb. I don't know what. But he's... Different. Psychotic. SouIIess? (WHISPERS) Yeah. Look, I shouId've got rid of that damn thing years ago. So, Iook, I... I mean, if I have this monkey's paw and it works, right? WeII, then I can just wish aII this undone. It'II give you what you ask for but not the way you want it. It takes from what's there. It spits it back, darker. Poisoned. Don't bring any more misery upon yourseIf. It must've gone weII, judging by the Iook back there. Yeah, Iet's get out of here. LittIe bitter? ABBY: Mississippi? Jackson, which was named after Andrew Jackson. Right. Nevada? -Uh, Carson City. -(KNOCKING) HoId on, baby. Stay right here. Are you Abby? ABBY: He came by here. His face, he seemed different. Oh, weII, I don't know. What happened to him? Um, I don't know. Something bad. Whatever it is, I feeI responsibIe. (LAUGHS) No. Mmm-mmm. No. You didn't make him what he is. You see, Tony was aIways a bad egg. I guess that's how I got in troubIe with him in the first pIace. I Iiked bad eggs. Now I'm paying for it. So what are you gonna do now? I don't know. That's what I'm trying to figure out. (SIGHS) Oh. God. I... (SOBBING) I shouId... I shouId... I shouId've... (DISTANT CLINKING) (THUDDING) (GRUNTS) I don't beIieve it. (GASPS) Oh, no. No. PIease, wait. PIease. No! (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (CAMERA CLICKING) MargoIis. OFFICER: Witness describes an older dude. Big son of a bitch about 6'2'', he drives an oId modeI 4x4. Sounds famiIiar. I think it might be that Tony Cobb character, sir. The warehouse is the connection.
