You mean you couldn't keep your hands off them. - Hey, Bill. - Hey, Tony. - How are you? - Good. Turn that down, will you, Leo? You see what's happening in the news today with this thing of ours? You mean this thing of theirs. Greed. Nothing but greed. That's what they teach these days. Greed. They feed it to their young. And you know their motto? All for me, none for you. What's wrong, Bill, tell me. I don't want to disturb you, but I have no other option. So what's the problem. Frankie Andreoli. My son-in-law opened up an iron works shop on Washington Street. Frankie comes by and tells him that since Bobby Stax is away for two years now that he's running the neighborhood, and Sean has to pay him every week to keep the shop open. We don't want any trouble. I don't know what else to do. Patience. Times are changing. Good things are coming soon. You'll see. Thank you, Tony. - So? - So what? Since my brother's gone and I'm retired, what can I do? Now, if someone took care of the root of the problem... Another one, Leo. What's going on, Leo? Don't shoot the messenger. Out with it. - Bobby Stax is getting out. - What? That scumbag can't be getting out. I just got the word. He's doing 8 years. It's not possible. I wanted to tell you before somebody else did. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Okay. Hey, Dopey, remember what I said: Get a real job. Father in heaven, we praise your name for all who have finished their life loving and trusting you, for the example of their lives, the life and the grace you gave them, and the peace in which they rest, we praise you today for your servant Roberto and for all that you did through him. May the peace of the Lord be with you, brother, and may the peace of the Lord be with all gathered here today. Are you staying? His life was useless. G, he was your father. His life and the life are useless. Now is not the time. It was never the time. I'm leaving tonight. I love you. Me too, kid. What's this all about? Roberto Zarra. He was blown up tonight outside his house. Fuck Roberto Zarra. He's nothing to me. Do you deny that we found these in the trunk of your car? Where's my fuckin' lawyer? You're gonna die, Bobby! You're dead! You hear me? You're dead! There you go, girls. There you go. Here you are. It's all right. Rodney, take care of them, you hear? - Where the hell you been? - Looking for a parking spot. They called us already. Where the hell have you been? - Okay, so I think we gotta... - Listen! I'll tell you what to think. I'm gonna lay it out for you so you can do your job. It's a bullshit DUI. I had a few drinks and got behind a wheel. I mean, I live a few blocks away. Who the fuck can afford a cab these days, you know? Yeah, right. Yeah, of course. On the way home, some fucking boy runs out in front of the car in the middle of the road, chasing after a fucking ball. Ain't gonna be no pro athlete. I would assume not. You broke his arm and leg. It was an honest mistake, you know? And I got my girl... Connie, get your ass over here. I'm comin', babe. She'll testify that I was with her, right, babe? Of course, babe. Holy shit. Wait, you got what I said? Believe this shit? We get it, the kid's hurt, but not this bad. Probably an insurance job. Probably just dressed the kid up and propped him up in a chair. - I mean, a soccer ball? - Gentlemen, gentlemen. Let's move this along now. Sorry, Your Honor. State of New Jersey v. Piscano. Are you prepared to enter a plea? Yes, Your Honor. Hey, what the fuck you doing? Your Honor, my client here may very well look like an exemplary citizen, but, in fact, he's a drunk. Womanizer. He's an asshole, to be honest with you. So we plead no contest, Your Honor. All right. Sentencing on the 28th. You son of a bitch! I'm come after you! You ain't no fuckin' lawyer, and I ain't paying you shit! You keep your money, you lose my number, and you get yourself a new lawyer. - Have a good day. - Yeah, take care. Hey, G man! I got one for you. - Vanessa Andreoli? - Yeah, it isn't pretty. Yeah, I can't imagine why not. You should make this a priority. You're the best. Can I help you? Yeah. I'm looking for an older gentleman, helps the less fortunate and thinks he's James Cagney. You know anyone around here like that? Mr. Hero! You've been missed. Oh, it's good to see you. Where's the old man? You know your uncle. He's either on the boat or up with those pigeons. If you see him, you don't say anything to him, okay? I want it to be a surprise. - My lips are sealed. - Thanks, Leo. There you go, guys. There you are. Well, look at you. Two years and you finally come to see your uncle. I'm sorry. I... Yeah, I know. Busy becoming a lawyer. No reason to forget family. Maybe you're ashamed. Never be ashamed of where you come from. Uncle Tony, it's not like that. Never seems to be enough time. Time? You make time. Family. That's what counts. Hell, you know that. It's bred in you. Prince Gaetano. Come here. - I miss you, I miss you. - I missed you too. Say, remember your little blue splash in your first race? You stayed up all night waiting for that bird to come home. - What tears. - How could I forget? It took two days. What a trouper he was. 400 miles that bird flies home. It is amazing how they do that. I missed you, G. I missed you, Uncle Tony. Let me get cleaned up. You're staying for dinner. Nonna would never forgive you. - She cooking? - She's cooking right now. - Let me go surprise her. - Go ahead. - Nonna! - Who's there? Hey! Nonna! Can I help you? Nonna, it's me. It's Gaetano. No. The only Gaetano I know is a wonderful boy. He loved his grandmother so much that he would come to visit her all the time. Nonna, it's... I got you going! Why would you do that to me? Come on! - I come all the way back and... - I miss you. Oh, I missed you too. And you look great. Look at you. Oh! Tell me everything. You have a new job, a new girl? Yeah, I got a job, working on the girl. Nonna, it smells incredible in here. Recipes from Lydia's cooking show. I'm making, um... chicken parmesan, baked ziti, uh, meatballs. But, Nonna, who's gonna eat all this? Tony! He's got a big appetite. Now you have some. Ma, I'm here! I told you before, stop banging on the ceiling with the broomstick! Look at what you're doing! You see the cracks, huh? I'm hungry! I wanna eat! What happened to your casserole? The oven. It burned my eggplant. It's a lousy oven. It's too old. I need a new oven, I keep telling you. I'll buy you a new stove. So now you're gonna start a law practice, huh? Yeah, I hope so. I mean, that's the endgame. You don't hope. You make things happen. Yeah. I gotta get going soon. Why don't you stay over? - Stay over? - Yeah, why not? Uncle Tony, I live in Hackensack. It's not that far. And it takes you two years to go 18 miles. You miss me, huh? There's something I wanna talk to you about before I go though. The zabaione will be ready in five minutes. Enough grappa, Ma. I'm thinking about taking a battered woman's case. I might need a little help with the evidence. Maybe I can help. Vanessa Andreoli. Married to Frankie Andreoli? You remember our boy Frankie, huh? Yeah. He's still the same punk he was back then, shaking down shops, restaurants. Lately he's been hanging out at Roma. Eats there with his crew. Never pays. Are you planning to take care of that? I told you, Ma, I'm retired. If Roberto was still here, he would take care of it. Nonna... If there's one thing that he didn't like, it's disrespectful punks. They killed your brother. Your father. My son. And nobody did anything about it. Anything! And now those people that killed Roberto are walking around free! Ma... Oh! My zabaione! You made me burn the dessert! What's with the Lucky Strikes? I thought you quit. I did, two years ago. Keep those right there in the desk. Buy a new pack once in a while. Used to be when I tried to quit, I wouldn't have any cigarettes in the house. When I get a craving, I'd run to the store and light up on the way home. But if they're sitting right there on the desk, I know I can have one if I wanna, so I don't. What's that? Your father's favorite piece. I keep it locked in the drawer to remind me that my brother was no saint. That's a funny thing there, Uncle Tony. What's that? You, me, and my father, we all carried guns, but for different reasons. A gun's just some piece of metal. It's the person who's holding it who makes it dangerous. Hey, so what was Nonna talking about downstairs? Who's walking around free? Didn't wanna tell you. Bobby Stax is getting out on appeal. After two years? What grounds? Don't know, but I'm gonna find out. I'm going to Roma's. You coming? Yeah. Now he's bringing half his family to eat free, that son of a bitch. Mr. Z! How about a nice booth? Gaetano! - Nino, how you doing? - I'm fine. It's you we're all worried about. Come on in, gentlemen. Make yourselves comfortable. Gaetano! Our hero! How you doing, Frankie boy? Me? I'm doing good. You see, things have changed around here a bit, and I'm on the right side of things now. Oh, yeah? Yeah, you see them? They're with me now. And you see this? All mine. And you see this? I use it to instruct people that it ain't "Frankie boy" no more. It's "Mr. Andreoli," even to you, so you better know your place around here. I know my place around here, Frankie. I think it's you who's a little mixed up though. See, I'll beat the shit out of you in front of those guys, then I'll take this... and I'll blow your fucking brains out with it, and then I'll take that money. I'll take anything I want from you, Frankie, just like when we were younger. Don't you ever fucking forget it, Frankie boy. Go ahead and shoot. No, no, no, please, not here. Relax, Nino. We're just playing around. Right? Old times. Say, let me buy you two heroes a drink. To safe passage home, from wherever it may be that you are coming from. Frankie, I heard you and Vanessa broke up. That's none of your fucking business. How you treat your wife, yeah, you're right, that is none of my business. - Enough, G. - No, I gotta let him know... - I said enough! - Listen to your uncle. And you should lighten up, Frankie boy. I heard your boss is getting out, and you'll be back to running errands. Ronnie, let's go. That motherfucker. We're not gonna let him get away with that. In time. In time he's gonna end up like his father. That bastard. You want to stay? Have a good time. But if Frankie comes back... Hey, no, I'll be nice. Come here. Good to see you. Why don't you let me pour you something stronger? Hey, Mr. Friendly. Sorry, no, I was just... I was... unwinding. I've been away for a little while. Yeah, a lot of people around here been away for a while. What'd you do? Join the Army. Really? I joined the Army. I'm sorry. I just thought... No, no, no, it's okay. Yeah, I know you thought. Don't worry about it. Gaetano. You can call me G. Christine. You can call me Crissy or Crystal. Take your pick. Tough decision. Yeah. I'll let you know tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow. What'd you have in mind? I'll keep those to myself right now. So what brought you to New York and Roma's, of all places? Bright lights, big city. Wanna come out and do some theater, maybe get on Broadway. And then I realized about a million other girls had the exact same idea. But I know that Roma's is about one step above purgatory, but it pays the bills, especially when you got big shots like Frankie coming in and tipping well. Frankie's a lot of things, but big shot's not one of them. Not as big as he makes himself out to be anyway. Trust me. Oh, guys, look who's in town. Sure, retirement's getting too much for you. Can you use a caper? Matter of fact, I wouldn't mind a part-time job. You know, Officer Jimmy here is working on a real crime stopper. - I bet he could use your help. - Yeah? What is it, James? Oh, Nathan's is missing some hot dogs. Case of the century. - Still a pain in the ass, huh? - Yes, he is. Up in the office? He's waiting on you. - Chief. - Tony, how's Ma? Thanks for asking. Ma's great... when she's not drinking grappa. She is a great lady. Jim, I need your help with something. - With what? - Bobby. We're not talking about Bobby Stax now again, are we? I have to find a way to get this guy off the street. You really don't know, do you? Know what? What don't I know? The FBI's been through those files with a fine-tooth comb, and the case is closed. Why would the FBI be involved? So what do you think? Some guys are lucky or maybe not? Doing eight, getting out in two? Keep an eye on this guy. Bobby! Look at you in a suit. Come on, let's go, open the door. I wanna get cleaned up before this party. Oh! Nino, how you doing? Look who's here! Bobby Stax is back! That's right! Yeah, shut the fuck up. How you doing? All right, all right, my boys, all right. And from the looks of things around here, it's none too soon, all right? 'Cause things were a fucking mess, but as of now, we are back in business. What business is that, Mr. Stax? What the fuck are you doing here? It's a restaurant. I must be here to eat something. Well, the place is closed. This is a private party, so why don't you just get the fuck out? Yeah, you're having a private party, all right. But see, the problem is the terms of your parole state that you can't associate with known felons. Wait a minute. Are you insulting my cousins? Is that nice? Come on, just take a fucking walk, will you? You and me, we're gonna go. Not today, but we're gonna go. But today? Today is a party. Today we're celebrating! Yeah! Come on, why don't you come join us, huh? Come eat, have something to drink. Sit with the boys. We'd love to have him, wouldn't we? Come on, Mr. Zarra, come on. Go fuck yourself. You think? That's too bad, huh, boys? Everybody say goodbye. Say goodbye to Mr. Zarra. Bye, Mr. Zarra! You take care now, Tone. We'll see ya! We'll see you around the campus, you fucking prick! That's right! Don't worry about it. He'll get his. He'll get his. He ain't a cop no more. That's right. Mr. Zarra. The bulls. No, sir. FBI. I would've never known. Special Agent Clarke, Agent Kinsey. Let's cut to the chase. Okay, Tony. Bobby Stax. You should keep those scumbags in jail. We'd like to ask you not to do anything that would hinder our investigation. Hinder a federal investigation? I wouldn't think of it. I'm sure you're aware that we're in the midst of an organized crime roundup. Any move on your part regarding Bobby Stax could jeopardize years of surveillance. So you want me to stay away from Bobby Stax. And what are you gonna do for me? What'd you have in mind? If I leave Bobby Stax alone, you might find something in the files about my brother's murder. Anything's possible. Oh, one more thing. For personal reasons, maybe you could find some hard evidence on that scumbag Frankie Andreoli for me. You never know. You're a lot like your Uncle Tony. Yeah, really? How so? Well, you're both strong male figures, both feel the need to protect other people, and you feel responsible for them, strong sense of family. I think the older you get, the more like him you're gonna be. That's scary. What, is this a new talent of yours I don't know about? Start calling you Madam Zorra, psychic, or what? No, it just seems like you're always trying to save everybody. I'm not trying to save everybody. I'm just... No, I'm trying to... What about you? Why are we talking so much about me, all right? What kind of secrets you got? Oh, everybody's got secrets. Leave the questions in the courtroom, Mr. Zarra. You come here. We're gonna get the order of protection today. Oh, the order of protection. Well, then I'll be fine. - Okay, let's go. - He said he would kill me. - Let's go. - That's what he said. Frankie says he's gonna do something, he's gonna do it. Andreoli vs. Andreoli. Good morning, Ms. Mahn. Your Honor. Thank you. Miss Andreoli, where's your better half today? I'm sorry, Your Honor, but that is not funny, considering the numerous times that we've had to come here. Of course it's not funny. What is ridiculous is how many times you have been in this court with Ms. Andreoli. Your Honor, my client has suffered physical and psychological abuse. Something has to be done. Your Honor, my client loves his family. He'd never hurt a fly. Are you kidding? Ms. Mahn, I've told you many times. You need to provide further proof that Mr. Andreoli is, in fact, violating your client's rights. In that case, I will rule appropriately. - Ronnie? - Yeah. Remember when I told you about lowlife scum? Yeah. Well, there's one here now. Sonny! - What's up? - You missed four payments. I'm gonna be nice and maybe forgive the vig if you pay now. Bobby doesn't recognize you as his rep anymore. What can I say? I'm paying him. Now youse two guys can leave and go work it out and leave me out of it. Fuck you! Get the fucking money! Fucking deadbeat. You still owe me! He's down there. - Ah, thanks. - Yeah. Paul. Anthony! To what do we owe the pleasure? - Hey. - Just passing by. Hey, boys! Say hello to Mr. Z. - Hi, Mr. Z! - Hi! You here on police matters? Come on, Paul. I think maybe I'm taking a pinch. No, I'm not. Having a little excitement like the old days? Nice kids. They're beautiful kids. Sit down, will you, please? The future gangsters of America. Not on my life. Doctors, lawyers, Peace Corps. Anything but the life. Come on, let's eat. Oh, no, Paul, don't go through the trouble. What trouble? You come to visit the house, you break bread, we eat. You're family. Your brother, your father, even the black sheep, you. You'll always be part of the family to me. Of course. Thank you, Paul. Thank you, Marie. Thanks, honey. Salut. Salut. I've had something rattling in my head for years now, can't see to come to terms with. Maybe you can help. I'll try, but things aren't the same, you know. Bobby Stax. Bobby Stax is nothing. Roberto said that... Oh, that's what you want. Your brother Roberto. You still got that in your mind. Please, take it from me. He was like a son to me. Him and Paulie Jr. Crewed together for years. Whatever happened, it was his choice. To be in the family. It wasn't his choice. He grew up idolizing our father. Bobby Stax, I have this feeling... Come on, please, you're gonna ruin your mind. Take it from me. I keep beating myself up since I lost Paulie Jr. It has been too long, Paul. From the black sheep, I love you. I love you. Black sheep nothing. You know, you were always the smart one. Your father always said that. We were all very proud of you. Please eat. Hey! Hey, G! - Look who it is, huh? - What's going on? Not too much. Just popping by to see a friend. What have you been up to? I'm a doctor these days. You know, G, four times this month I'm here changing tires. Steady work for me, right? Poor girl. Yeah, I haven't seen her in a while, so... Hey, she's having a hard time of it, all right? We both know how Frankie can be, right? Yup. Hey, we're gonna catch up later, all right? - Yeah! - All right, good. Mom, you gotta promise me that if something happens, you're gonna take John. - Would you... - Mom, just promise me. I don't wanna hear this crazy talk anymore, do you hear me? Stop with the tears now. No more tears. Stop. Gotta listen to your mother, Vanessa. Oh, God. Sorry. Old habits, you know? I just let myself in. - What are you doing here? - Oh, how are you? Gaetano, come here, give me a hug. It's so good to have you back safe. Yeah, thank God for that, you know what I mean? How's Nonna? She's great, you know? I mean, she's crazy, but great. - Still crazy? - Yeah. So what have you been doing with yourself? Funny you asked. You got some time? Oh, yeah. Just let me clean up. All right. I don't know what to do anymore. I mean, my lawyer Claire, she's doing the best she can, but she doesn't really wanna deal with this. And you know, we're friends. That's why she's helping me out, but she's a corporate lawyer. She makes a lot of money, and I can't pay that much and... So let me take the case. - You? - Yeah. If you want me to, I'll take it. - You. - Yeah, me. What, you don't think I can do it? What, you're like serious? Yeah. Like serious. Oh, my God, yeah. I'm sure Claire would be thrilled to be off of it. - Good. Done. - I can't pay a lot. Don't worry about the money. I don't care about the money. - Do not even ask about... Oh, I gotta get back for my son. He was at a birthday party. All right, yeah, I'll just grab the check. G, I don't know how to thank you right now. Well, say thank you. Thank you. Oh, well, there you go. So we're clear on the fee? Look, Vanessa... G, please, okay? I can handle that much. We're clear on the fee. There's somebody I want you to meet. John, come here. Can you say hello to Mr. Zarra? Hello, Mr. Zarra. Hello, John. Wanna shoot hoops? Oh, no, no, not today, but maybe another time. Uh, yeah, I'll stick around, shoot some hoops. Sure. Yes! - You just made his day. - He got big. Gotta be here all day with him now. Hours and hours. Hey! What the fuck happened with Sonny? Nothing fucking happened. He's got a mouth on him, so I taught him some manners. Manners? I'll teach you fucking manners! He's a fucking scumbag who decided he wasn't gonna pay me, so I took my money! Go ahead, make a move, Ronnie. Our bust this in your fucking skull! Go ahead! Sonny belongs to me, Frankie boy! Me! I own him. Not you, me! This is my fucking territory! Stay out of my business! I'm fucking warning you right now! Stay out of it. Hey, Tommy! Where can I get a burger? Hey, I hope you guys are hungry. We got a ton of food back there. I miss the action, Sal. What action? The same scumbags doing the same shit. I'm telling you, Tony, two months, I'm out. Yeah? Then what are you gonna do? Gonna take it easy. Well, let me tell you, taking it easy ain't easy. You did the right thing getting out. Barry, how about a sausage? - Any onions? - Nah. Thanks. So you put this Bobby Stax matter behind you. I know you, Tony. He's out now, you're itching to do something. Sal, I know you're coasting on the job now, but I need something from the inside. - Like what? - I need the files from the investigation of Roberto's death. Files. Tony, you know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you, but even if I can get to them, what would they say? There must be something there that we missed. - Something, I don't know. - I know what they say. They say "case closed." It's got to be this Bobby. I had to have missed something, or there must be something covered up. You can't prove it, Tone. I'll see what I can do. Love you, man. Gotta go, Sal. See you later. I don't know, Uncle Tony. You should've seen that kid. I'm telling you, he was like starved for attention. You should've seen him when I was getting ready to leave. He was just begging me to stay. A father like Frankie? No wonder. Stay away from that kid. Do your job. Help Vanessa and stay the hell away from that kid, you hear me? Yeah, yeah, I know. And remember, like I told you before, you're getting into Frankie's business. I don't want anything to happen to you. I can handle myself. Famous last words. Something else I wanted to talk to you about. Frankie and his crew, they're having lunch at Roma's, and Crystal overheard Frankie talking about what he called a "big job." A day in the life of Frankie Andreoli. Terrorize his wife and kid, shake down a restaurant, plan a fire. Fire? How'd you know it's a fire? Insurance jobs. Frankie's specialty. I could never nail that little bastard. I'll let the guys at the precinct know. That's great. Gonna heave one towards the goal line... He only needed 10 yards for the field goal, and he goes deep? Dad was a Jet fan. There you go. He liked the Jets. I like the Giants. Me, the Knicks. Your father, the Nets. That's how different we were. Forget the law. Sports! That's what made us argue. Ah... You know what, G? It's nice to have you back. It's good to be back, Uncle Tony. Tony, there's a man downstairs asking for you! - Who is it? - FBI! I can smell them anywhere! Ma, send them up to the roof! What's the FBI want? We'll see. You here to give me information about my brother's murder? What information? I asked you to stay away from this investigation. Our reports are that you can't. You gotta stop asking questions. Let's stop this cat and mouse game. This isn't the game, Tony. Just bear with us for a few weeks. I promise you'll be pleased. Who has more patience than me? By the way, your mother, she's very nice. You know, she offered me cookies when I arrived. How were they? Burnt? A little, but they were very good, especially when you got past the black part. Surprised she didn't poison him. Ma, what'd you do, feed him some of your cookies? Well, unlike you, he liked them. He left that file for you. Good night. How'd you pull this off? Thank you. I owe you. - I gotta go though, all right? - Good night. Love you, Uncle Tony. Please state your name for the record. Gaetano Zarra, Your Honor, now the attorney of record for Vanessa Andreoli. And what do you plan to do differently than previous counsel? I have evidence, including video surveillance, that Frank Andreoli has violated my client's rights. Well, that would be nice, since I've yet to see anything that would lead me to rule on such a violation. Your Honor, I object to this nonsense. His client has never submitted one stitch of evidence. May I approach the bench, Your Honor? Approach the bench. All right, with regard to this, there appears to be sufficient evidence to enter an order. Protection is in full force, Mr. Rhodes. I don't think I need to remind you that your client will face serious charges if he violates this order. Order granted. Look, Frankie, I think we should lay low a little while. Shut up. I can't lay low now. Well, hero boy G just kicked our ass in there. Punk motherfucker. Well, look, he's looking to put you back in jail and is trying to get Vanessa sole custody of your son. He's dreaming. Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. Court loves this guy. War hero, Purple Heart. Well, do your job and shut him down. Look, I'm the last guy to get you going, Frankie, but your wife doesn't have any more money. We made sure of that. So how is she paying this guy? You know what I mean? - Fucking bitch! - Frankie, no! Huh? What are you doing, huh? Are you fucking... Mommy, Daddy, stop! Please stop! Get off of me! Daddy, please don't hurt Mommy! Get over here! You know I'll fucking kill you, bitch! Look what you're doing to your son, Frankie! This is your fault. You're nothing but a fucking whore. It's okay, baby. Come here, let me look at you. So what's this all about? I love these pancakes. You sure I can get you some pancakes, Paul? Please. It's a treat. So, while I was doing my bid, this mutt grew a pair of balls. He's somebody now. He's disrespecting the chain of command, Paul. And frankly, he's stepping all over my dick. Fuck you. I don't work for you no more. Maybe not, but you stay the fuck out of my way, understand me? Just stay out of my way. You guys talk a little nicer, for Christ's sake. The whole world is dissolving, and you two can't even sought out a 15-block neighborhood. Both of you. So, Frankie boy, Paul is here to set you straight, so pay attention, you fucking jerk-off. Fuck you, Bobby. These are new times. What I've got, I've earned, and no one's gonna take it away or deny it. So go fuck yourself and fuck your manners! You see what I'm dealing with, Paul? You see what I'm dealing with, this fucking guy? Please sanction it. Let me take care of this guy, please. Eat your pancake. Okay. Okay, Paul. Everything we do in life... good, bad... does it come back to bite us? What I've got, I've earned. This neighborhood is mine! You're nothing! I think she likes you. My friend runs an animal shelter, and I saw this girl staring up at me with big, sad eyes, so I took her home. - You bought a puppy? - I didn't buy a puppy. What are you gonna do with it, with the hours you work? Oh, no, no. I can't keep her. Not just because of my hours. My roommate's allergic to dogs. So what are you gonna do with her? I figure maybe she could stay with you. Don't you want to stay with G? No. No. Don't even... She's lovely, she's cute. Not a chance. Fine. I'll take her back to the shelter. I'm sure someone will take her home eventually. When? When? - I'll take her back tomorrow. - All right. Tonight I was gonna take you to Amalfi's. We can have a nice romantic dinner, huh? We can have a romantic dinner at Amalfi's anytime. Tonight I figure we get a bottle of wine, some takeout, and a few dog treats. Just the three of us. It'll be fun. Threesome. All right. Sounds good. You convinced me. Good choice. - That was easy. - All right, get in the boat. Oh, shit. Try to keep your cool, man. You really don't belong here, ma'am. I am here to protect my daughter, Frankie. Get a life. Please! I am begging you to end this now. Ask your daughter what she's been doing to me. For your son's sake, Frank. My son is fine. Fine? This life that you think is so glamorous? Haven't you heard? This life doesn't exist. This life is filled with garbage. And you are garbage. And if you were any kind of a man, you would do the right thing by your son. And what would that be? Walk away, Frankie. Oh, let me tell you something. I back down to nobody. No Zarra's gonna tell me what to do. This meeting here never happened. We never spoke. You heard what the judge said. Now I think you better go home. You are pathetic, Frankie, and I feel sorry for you. You look like shit. - Ma, please. - Out all night? Was Gaetano with you? Come in the kitchen. I'm making cannolis. You want a cannoli? Ma, we have to talk. We have to talk about the cooking. It's starting to get dangerous now, Ma. What do you care? You're gonna burn the place down. What do you care? All you care about is the birds and wasting time with whores. Ma... You know what the neighbors say about you? Cornuto. Ma! Your brother had Gaetano. What have you got? Nothing. Nothing to show you were here, to have left your mark. The Zarra mark. Ma, your cooking... I don't care about the building or the birds. It's you. Why do you think I'm here? All right, your brother had problems, but he was about family. You? I don't know with you. I can't believe you! I could've been married so many times. Why do you think I didn't? Why do you think I'm here living in this apartment? For you! For you! I'm just tired. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! You were always the strong one. I'm sorry. I'm okay, Ma. Go. Hi, poochie! - This is her. - Oh, she's so cute. Oh, my, that is adorable. Look at that face! Hi! Look at your face. Don't worry about it. John is gonna love her. John is gonna love you. - You still okay with this? - Yeah. - You sure? - He really needs this. You ready? John! Look what G brought. Mom, look at the puppy! Isn't she cute? Come here. Does she have a name? No, not yet. You wanna name him? Can I? Yeah, sure, go ahead. - Wow. - Mom, can we keep her? Oh, uh, I don't know. I'll name her Smiley. Hi, Smiley. She does have a kind of smile. Who's gonna take care of her? I will, I will. I promise I will. Okay, then. Smiley it is. Thank you! - Welcome home, Smiley! - Come on. - Thank you so much. - No, thank you. Please stay. I'll get you a drink. - Let's talk in the kitchen. - Yeah. Listen, G, I can't thank you enough for how you've taken on my burdens here. Really love you for it. Vanessa, you're practically family. I'm just glad I could be here for you. I wish I was there for that. Listen, there something I gotta tell you, something I should've told you a long time ago. It's about the night your father was killed. Okay. I overheard Frankie and one of his goons, um... Uh, what'd you hear? I think that Frankie was involved. What? You want me? I'm right here! Night, boss. Hey! Why don't you just fucking stop already, huh? Stop asking questions, stop fucking snooping around. I mean, you ain't a fucking cop anymore! Didn't take you too long. Sorry, Paul. I just needed a friend. You're more than that. Come on in. Paul Jr. and Roberto were the best of friends. Always smiling when they were together. Anthony, they were like two sons to me. It hurts like hell that they're not here anymore. Paul, something happened with Bobby Stax. Didn't I tell you to stay out? It just happened. It doesn't matter anymore, okay? What do you mean? Bobby did not clip your brother. Frankie Andreoli will be at the mercantile warehouse tomorrow. Maybe we can finally close this chapter, and I can get some sleep. What the fuck do you... You mother... Now where's Frankie Andreoli? - Where the fuck is Frankie? - Who are you, bastard? Where do you want a bullet? You want it in this side? You want it in your fucking nose? Or how about this side, huh? You tell me where the fuck Frankie Andreoli is, or I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out! You motherfucker. Mercantile warehouse. You killed my brother. Now I'm gonna kill you. Uncle Tony! G, what are you doing here? - Put the gun down. - Like hell I will. Talk some sense into him, for Christ's sakes. All I did was... What you did was kill my brother! Get out, G. He's all mine. Uncle Tony, what are you thinking? Call the fucking cops. I don't care. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - I'll do my business. Hey, whoa, whoa! Uncle Tony, listen to me, okay? Because of this fucking scumbag, I lost my father. But I don't wanna lose you now, okay? - He deserves to die. - I know. If you pull that trigger, I will cover for you, okay? But they might not believe me, and then they're gonna put me in prison after the fact. Now this is over. You did it. Uncle Tony, I'm begging you. Please, just put down the fucking gun, and we will deal with this. I'm going in the front way! Jimmy, go around the back! I'm gonna take the inside! I got two trucks going! Bobby was working with us as an informant. That's how we knew about Frankie. Can I talk to you a minute? Be right back. So who am I talking to? A struggling actress? FBI agent? Look, I know how all this looks. But I promise, if you just give me a chance to explain. Just save it, all right? Okay. It'll make for good dinner conversation. Need you to come by the precinct, give me a statement, okay? You too, G. No problem. Come on, let's go home. What are we gonna tell 'em? Don't gotta explain anything. According to the law, we were totally in the right. Yeah? What law would that be? Zarra's law. Hey! Uncle Tony, what's in this? Gravel, pieces of stone. You sure that ain't a body? Nobody you know. The rope is made of hemp. It'll dissolve. The burlap too. Biodegradable burlap. That'll leave the rocks and gravel. Nice home for the fish. How long you been doing this? Been building this artificial reef now for, I don't know, six years? As a lawyer, I gotta ask you a question. You got a permit for this? For what? I'm just out here at the bay, minding my own business. Yeah. Hey, me and Crystal, we're going out for dinner tonight. You wanna join us? Nah. I don't eat with feds. Be careful what you say, Uncle Tony. You may have to soon. Look at you. Is she the one? Maybe. She could be. I don't know. Someday women may be scarce. Yeah. Oh! Casablanca. Yeah, and look how Rick Blaine wound up. You don't wanna be alone like Rick or like me. See, I've decided that retirement isn't me. I'm looking for a job. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I'm thinking I might wanna be an investigator. Tony Zarra, PI. Well, that's got a nice ring to it, huh? - Yeah, it does, doesn't it? - Got any leads? I heard this young lawyer from Hackensack might need some help on his cases. You got a resume? Yeah, I got a resume. Hey, got you again! Let's load it up there, Gaetano.
