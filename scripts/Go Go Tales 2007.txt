You cannot touch the girls! -Okay, okay. -One more time and you're outta here! How we doing? Well, if we permutate the first 3 numbers and use 7 as a banker, it will cost an additional... Just a minute, just hold it. We need another $1,240.00. Do we have that? - We're $110 short. - Oh, God. Jesus, I don't know how much I've got but... That's all I've got. Nothing more. - That everything? - That's everything. Jack... Ahh, Jesus. Alright, - Here. -$100 don't do it. Direct from Saturn, the space-age, spaced-out Sophie! and the music is composed and performed by Sophie herself. CD may be purchased right here; Distribution by Ray of Hope records!

Always, always, always - Mr. Murray! Oh! Murray - he did it! He's incredible! He's an inspiration. I had my money on Ling. I thought he'd win this time. The landlady's here... Lilian! What's she doing? What are the odds that's she's not here for the rent? Look on the bright side, she didn't bring the marshal with her. Be careful. Have Nasim help you with these. Take your time and double-check every number. - That's the last batch. - Be right back. Where is Ray? I'm here to pick up a check! He's at the dentist - he'll be right back. This place stinks! What is going on here? It's a mess! I'm have the marshals come tomorrow. See this bag? Do you know whose this is? Do you know who these people are? These are the people who will pay their rent on time! That's what I'm trying to tell you! Maybe we can get you a job there! - Will I get a bonus? - You can sell towels in the toilet dept.! - Ray, you want me to go with you? - No, I'm just going to the bank. - You want a coffee? - No thanks. You people are crazy! I oughta kill you! Why am I talking to you? Your name is not on the lease! Where is Ray? I want Ray! Hello, Nasim. How are you? - Fine. - Good. - I've got those final numbers. - I feel lucky today. Don't start talking to me about luck... Luck? It'll be a big night. I just want to see what 18 million dollars looks like. For what I pay you, I don't want to hear the word "luck". How's it going, Zoom? "Win for Life". What a great name. We have some extra-special talent tonight... and now - the scariest, sexiest girl in the world Ally, Ally from the Valley! The beautiful Ally! If he's not gonna pay me tonight, I'm not working anymore! - He's screwing us. - Give him a break, okay? What do you mean give him a break? It's been 48 hours, I got bills to pay. - When has he let you down? - Where do I start? You guys relax, we'll get paid I'm sure. What's the story? - He's going to the bank. - At 6 o'clock at night? - I'm not going out! - What the fuck's going on? We're supposed to be paid in cash. When Ray gets back, everyone gets paid. Give me my fucking money, I got bills to pay. Girls, girls - give me a couple of hours. Fuck, where are my red shoes? Hot dogs! Hot dogs! Free- range hot dogs. You want some? How about you? You want a hot dog? Hot dogs! There's a fucking dog in here! Hot dogs! Oh no! This shit is horrible! Your dog ate my hot dogs! He's going to be sick for a week. Can you help me get him up, please? - Get this shit away from him! - Get that dog out of here! Come on, dog! - It's a fucking zoo in here! - Where's the Health Department? Hot Dogs! Hot... Hot dogs! Luigi, what the fuck is going on here? I'm changing the bulbs. I saw you change that... Dolly - don't get like them. You are the only nice one. - Don't become a bitch. - What are you doing? It works - it's fixed. - Tomorrow you'll get paid. - Where the hell is he? - Don't tell me you still haven't been paid? - Yeah, 48 hours... - Have you seen my eyeliner? - He's at the bank. It's night. What are you talking about? Why do you let him do this to you? He said he was going to the bank. He's been acting weird all week. Do you know that everywhere else you get paid at night? Who are you? I've never seen you before. Look, man - I've been all over the place. I've been around... You've been here for 2 days; I've been here for 6 months. I've been working this shit for 10 years. I don't give a shit about Ray. I want to get paid. Get back, get back! - What's the problem? - The money. When he gets back from the bank, he will settle up with everybody. You'll get your money! Did Ray ever cheat you? We have 24 hours to pay you. And you shut up! If I don't get paid... Shut the fuck up, you bitch! I'm going to buy cigarettes. Ray, open up! It's me, Jay. - Open up! - Go ahead The girls are threatening a work stoppage. Have you ever heard of a stripper that won't strip? Get serious. Check it out - you see this? You got $20? Will you stop it? I gave you my last $100. - Nasim? - Yes? Win for life? I'm sorry, cash only. - You don't know what you're missing. - Sorry. Just tell the girls they will get their money in 24 hours. - Yeah I told them that yesterday. - Tell him 36, then. We're already past 48. When that lottery goes off tonight, they'll be dancing. We will all be dancing. And now, the man who makes it happen at the Paradise - the King of the Dancing Girls - the one and only Mr. Ray Ray Ruby! Good evening to all, yes, I am Ray Ruby and this is my paradise. But tonight it can be your paradise too. So sit back and relax and I invite you to enjoy the hospitality these beautiful women. And remember, ladies love a gentleman. I see you've been getting acquainted, but now is the time to properly introduce you to these gorgeous creatures that inhabit my Paradise! Dolly, from Houston, Texas! Go get 'em, cowboy! Mission Control, get ready to launch! Don't worry about the money Ray, I know we're going to get it. Madison, from the great Midwest! I'm mad about this girl! I need the money. Sugar, from Long Island! Two lumps, please! Sophie, from Paris! Oh, look at that, look at that! Salome, Albania! Salome from Albania! Don't take my head off! Tania, from Siberia! I feel a little husky downstairs! Give me the money! Electrifying Electra! Electrifying Electra! Somebody die? Last but not least, Aurora, direct from Rome! Aurora, wherever you go I will certainly follow! Alright, girls - let's see what you've got! C'mon girls, let's shake it! Let's party up! I'm a lucky man. Gone already? But show has just begun. C'mon - you don't know what you're missing. - What's wrong with the girls? - No, the girls were great. C'mon, c'mon! No,no. I gotta work tomorrow. Next time. Next time. One more minute... Babylon? Massapequa? Massapequa Park! Amityville? Copague? Yeah, thank you! Great! Thank you! Go home to your wives, you pussies! Unbelievable, man. Don't worry, don't worry... Thursday night has started and I've got a good feeling... For a second there, I thought that Bobby G. was starting a shift for them.. We ought to put the girls on the train. They're working the late shift. Give me a rye. I'll take another one too, Junior. I thought we were off and running tonight. The show as just... - How was it? - Great! Great! I was looking at you rather than the girls. They're enjoying it. They're spending like there's no tomorrow. They seem to be enjoying it. We're doing fine. Ray - this is a great show, but we're giving away champagne every night and by 8:30 we're empty! What are we going to do? Times are changing; we have to change with them. These Chinese guys are the future... we have to rethink the demographics of our audience. Maybe more advertising in Midtown - a lot of Chinese tourists in town now. Here's a good idea: on Thursday and Friday we have a "2-fer". -"2-fer"? - Yeah, they buy 1 and you give them 1. It's not necessary - you talk like we're going under or something. Why give away when it's coming to us? Just be patient. It's coming our way; it's coming our way! I've got a little surprise for you later tonight. Ray, you're the boss and what you say I'll do. Hey, Luigi? I had dinner with Charlie Manson last night. And you know what he said? - What? "Is it hot in here or am I crazy?" - You know who I had dinner with? -Who? Jeffrey Dahmer. - Really, and what'd he say? "Who you gonna eat?" Jesus Christ! Thank you, Baron. What's going on? I heard there's a problem. Do I look like a fucking gangster? Do I look like a gangster? Monroe treats me like a gangster; I'm a chef. I'm a chef that prepares organic hot dogs. - So why does he treat me like this? - What's going on? The dog ate my hot dogs! - I'll take care of it. - Now she wants to bring it in the kitchen! - Not in the kitchen! - It already happened! - I'll make sure the dog stays out of here. - Please. Thank you. And besides, the Health Department... We could keep it outside maybe, where the girls smoke. We can't have that, man. The dog cannot be within 100 feet of the kitchen. I'll take care of it. - Feel secure. - I know you have my back. - I do. - By the way, how's the reality show coming? We're very close. We have some people interested; its a fresh idea and they like you very much. And they love these hot dogs. Wait - I've got to deep-fry and microwave it. No, I like it like this. Like eating sushi. It may seem like Nobu, but is better than Kobe beef. I have a cousin who's in the record business... ...do you want to invest? - No, I'm not interested. I wanted to talk to you later about a food court idea... ...something I've been thinking about. Don't worry, I'll take care of the dog. - Ray! - Lillian, you look radiant. Cut the crap, Ray! Think any of these band could play the Hora? - The Hora? - Jay, you never went to a Bar Mitzvah? I don't think a strip club is the place for a Bar Mitzvah. Tough shit! Why should I pay for a hall when I own one right here? Why try to be something we're not? Especially when there's money around the corner. Yeah, at Chase Manhattan where you guys don't have an account! Listen to me: you're 4 months behind on the rent and I've got some guys coming here tomorrow to take measurements. Measurements? Like 36-24-36? No, Ray. Serious people - I'm talking about Bed, Bath & Beyond: $ 18,000 per month, 99 years lease. I can ask them if they'll give you two guys a job. Lillian, have faith. The club business goes in cycles. We're growing now... with the busiest months yet to come. You haven't seen a busy month in your fucking life, Jay! What's that? A lottery ticket? My God! What is it with you guys? It's an old lottery ticket - what's the big deal? You guys are losers! I'm going to close The Paradise! And 4 months rent - don't forget! Fuck you Charlie Chan and your #2 son as well! - Ling! - Here's your jacket. What the hell happened? Damn, you were the favorite. This cost $9.95 now? We even had you a tape made. This is your bill. You got some more there? I'll check those as well. Okay guys, here's another favorite - Lola from Minnesota. Junior, there's an art in what you're doing. You're turning good booze into moose piss. - He's lucky Ray likes him. - Yeah. You're gonna get the place closed down. Put that away. If anyone sees that... shit. The Baron will take care of it. He's a bloody monster. - Yes? - Hey, Ray. It's Adrian and Dolly. Okay - hang on. Come in, come on in. - Who is dancing now? - Do not know, Sugar, I think. Have a seat. So what is it? - We wanted to tell you something... - Good news? We are pregnant. No, I mean I'm pregnant. - No, she's pregnant. - Congratulations. it's a beautiful thing. How far along are you? Stand up. It's my 2nd month, but you can tell. Dolly says you can tell a little bit. - So you did the test? - Yes, and I'm sure. - I took 4 tests. - Are you excited? - Yes, she is happy, but I'm feeling... - What? - You have got to help us. - I will. I want you to be happy here. I don't want anyone working... that isn't happy here. This is like a family. I want everyone to be happy here because this is our place. So don't worry. Do you want to take some time off? The point is - we need our money. - She can't dance... she doesn't want... - Of course, she can dance. We came from the doctor. She can't. I mean, she could but... We need a second opinion. Do you remember Cleo? She danced until the sixth month, she was quite an attraction and the baby's beautiful. This case is very delicate. Okay, you know what? You can take some time off... you can think about it... but right now, you're here and we have the show to do. Just sleep on it; think about it. - Okay? - Alright. - You will give you us the money, right? - Of course, we take care of our people. - I'm having a baby, please don't let us down. Okay - this is our baby. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fire! Fire! Fire! Get back! Get back! Go get the fire extinguisher! Hope we still have insurance... Why are you waiting to call the fire department? Don't think you're going to burn this place down, you fucking idiots! My machine! - That's a $5000 machine. - $10,000! What do I do now? It's alright, it's okay. Don't touch - it makes it worse. Here, here. I'll send someone down. Please. Hello, I'm Marlon Mason with tonight's winning Lotto numbers. Tonight's Lotto jackpot is 18 million dollars. - Oh, that's lovely. - Good luck! And now the first number up... is... number... Come on! The first number is 6. That's alright - we don't have to worry about the first 3 numbers. I understand - we've got those covered. C'mon Miss Ireland - give us a number. - 17! - Ah, sweet 17! God bless you. Are we good? We got it covered. It's coming up right now - 8! - Fair enough - we got that covered. - They didn't fuck us. Now we get to the numbers that matter. And coming up now, number... - Jay! Jay! - Just a minute. I'm checking. - Oh, Jesus, we've got it. - Let me hear! Number 52. - Do we got it? Do we got it? - Just a minute! Give me a chance... - Holy mother of God, we've got the fucking... - Quiet! - We need a 7. - Please, love, a 7. Number... 7! - 7! 7! - We are millionaires! I love you! I love you! I just realized... we have to find out where the numbers are. They're either... behind the Tampon machine in the ladies' restroom or behind the air duct in the Igloo Lounge. Either way we're fucking millionaires! I think I'll buy Dublin for a start. What about you? Are you alright? I don't care about the money! Long live the Paradise Lounge! Hey Johnny! How's my favorite aunt? How's my nephew? Come here. - How are things? - How does it look? - They paying you? - Only what I can steal. - What's this? - The Famous Coconuts. Your brother's idea. - A terrible idea. - How much do they cost? - Whatever I can get. - Are they selling? No - who would buy that crap! Who's this, Benjamin Franklin? Cool, eh? This is me. Give me 2 of the Baron. - Where's my change? - Take your change in coconuts. - We wiped your ass when you were a kid. - We're even then. That's the way to do it! - Hello, Murray. - How are you, John? How have you been? You guys look beautiful! How's the beauty parlor business? We just finished our annual "Frost-a-thon Extravaganza". We now about frosting... looks like I lost all my hair. - I was in Boca for a week. - Fantastic. I wasn't in Boca. A lot of excitement here. I was taking care of business, Johnny. These stupid jerks nearly started a fire here. - What are you talking about? - You stupid idiot! You nearly burned the fucking place down. - Luigi started it. - Me? That Ally decided to get an extra 3 minutes on her tan and she put aluminum foil on the bulbs. She could have killed us all! And what is it going to cost me for the machine? - It was custom made. - For what - a dollar? I don't have your money, Lillian. And you're never gonna get it because Murray's going to get it. Yeah, Murray needs it for lap dances. Baron wants to buy you a drink. Busy, busy, busy. I'm sick of it - I'm not doing it anymore. I love you but, I'm not doing it anymore. - 20 minutes ago we were packed. - 20 minutes is like a lifetime ago. Look the 8:30 train takes them home, and then we have the late rush. What are you doing there? You are paid to dance! Take your top off darling please. Everyone's down there drinking my booze. A bunch of corpses. They're not corpses. Jay, open the door. Come on! - Where is he? - He's sleeping. - Did you tell him? - How could I tell him? I can't tell him. Good things are beginning to happen. Don't give me that Irish bullshit. The only money coming in here is mine. You do the accounting. Where's the money? John. a business like this goes in cycles. This place is a loser. Let me tell you about these 4 guys, there was a job to be done, and everyone thought someone else would do it. But nobody did it, This made someone very angry. Anyone could do it, but no one did. Everyone got angry because no one did it. What the fuck are you talking about? I'm pulling the plug tonight. - This will kill him. - This will save his life. I'd rather see him in Miami getting a tan, chasing girls. The money I've invested here, he could live like a king. So tonight it's official: Paradise has closed. We have some extra special talent tonight and now - the scariest, sexiest girl in the world - Monroe, Monroe from Marseilles! - Who's that? - That's Monroe. Monroe? She's new? Yeah, she's the new attraction. She's bringing them in by the busload. What's her name again? Monroe. Let me introduce you, You are her boss for Christ's sake. Yes, let's go. Come on! There she goes, Monroe! Incredible! Will you get that for me, please? Please - come on. Get that for me! - Monroe, Monroe! - What? Where the fuck are you going with that dog? - Ray told me... - You can't put the dog in my kitchen. I'm putting it on the terrace. Monroe, you're killing me! You're busting my balls. Get the fuck out. Not in the kitchen! John, this is ridiculous. This girl, Monroe has her dog in my kitchen. - John, I need you help. - No, I don't care about your hot dogs. What a dream. How are you? The only thing harder to do than to win the lottery is to lose the ticket! What do you mean, Jay? Are you saying you do not know where it is? Jay... You remember the night when Danny Cash came around with that $1500 bottle of Ch?teau Morgot and insisted that we had to stay open for half an hour before we could drink it? Yes, Ally was dancing and she knocked the bottle over on my jacket. And you took the jacket to Ling's to get cleaned. He charged me $100. Do you know how many lap dances that is? That was the night we bought that batch. I've got to find a new dry cleaner. - It must be somewhere. - Showtime, Ray! Come on! What did you say? You keep looking... - I'll do the show. - I'll keep looking. Didn't you write it down? - Didn't you write it down? - I've checked in the computer. - I'm tired of looking for it! - Jay, relax. They swore up and down, gone a week. Never said... Danny Cash! Hey, Bobby G. You're still the best looking broad here. Here, give me... give me lap dances for the guys. These are my boys - come on! Luigi - welcome back! - Where have you been? - Laying low. Danny Cash! How are you? - You're looking good. - Thank you. I try. I want you to meet the guys: Dr. Steve, Dr. Young and that is Dr. Fung. These guys just saved my life. Well, I go to New Jersey, OK? Going to see that guy - you know... the one that sells watches. On the way back, suddenly, I feel like pastrami. I stop at a deli, walk in Pastrami, sauces of all kinds, good wine, all good. I take a bite, and next thing I know pastrami is caught in my throat. I can't breathe. Can't breathe and my eyes are bulging out. In the mirror across from me, I look like Rodney Dangerfield! Dr. Steve, out of nowhere, runs over performs a fucking maneuver called Heinklik. Heimlich. He's grabbing me like this: I'm looking in the mirror and it's surreal. Dr. Wong comes and hits me low, Dr. Fung comes and gets me around the top - It looks like I've got 2 guys fucking me in the ass. And I'm looking in the mirror, and I think: "What the fuck is going on, am I going to die with 2 guys in my ass?" Next thing - this guy hits me in the stomach, pastrami flies out of my mouth and hits a woman in the back of the head. The woman was... Mrs. Hillary, perhaps future President Clinton, right? You are the king of crap! Hillary Clinton with 2 security guards! Come and enjoy the show. Good story. Lap dances until your cocks fall off! Here, right by the stage. - Did you really save his life? - Yes, really. Junior - champagne here for the hero! Listen, Rule #1: you can look, but don't touch. Okay? Take your pick and swap them later. Let's see your tits. You ready? Danny Cash is here. Don't worry, he's with some doctors. Knock them out kid, knock them out. The girl with golden hair The girl with the Irish eyes The girl like no other girl in this world and she's mine shining brighter than the brightest star that shines Star of mine The girl from gay Paris the one I keep close to me The girl like no other girl in this world - Johnny? - Did you drop this? - Wow. - I'll keep it. You can't keep that. It was very expensive. Like 350 bucks. I got money. Real money. I don't have any of those funny Ray-Ray dollars. I've got hundreds. - How much are you going to give me? - Whatever you want. This was $350, but you can give me $400. You can get this too, but you have to pay. Can I see your money? Oh, sorry. I feel faint. - You got butterflies? - You make me feel shy. You want to put money in my panties? You want to get them off, don't you? This is real money. Not Ray-Ray dollars. I'm taking my panties off. That's why I'm talking about. Look at that - nice and slow. We've got all night. They told me that you're a famous hairdresser, right? That's right, baby. I have the biggest... I have the biggest beauty salon in Staten Island. - Really? - Yes Is it called "Johnny's"? - I guessed it. - How did you know? - It's called "Johnny's". - I am a witch. Johnny, would you like a private dance? "The girl from Singapore the one I can't ignore The girl like no other girl in this world and she's mine Shining brighter than the brightest star that shines Stars of mine Thank you, thank you. These girls are beautiful - we must be in "Paradise". And now, the real entertainment begins. Ladies and Gentlemen, Adrian! Adrian! - The new one is beautiful! - How's the salon king? She's ready for her big break. You're in for a surprise. If it doesn't work out, we can always get you a new one. - Listen... - You like that? A beautiful song. I'm pulling the plug. Don't joke around. - I can't do it anymore. - Johnny, you can't... I can't, I can't. John, I'm building something here, you want to quit? You're out that's fine. I thought... I thought we were making something here. You just have to be patient. I've been patient. It's a vicious circle. - You're my brother. I love you. - No, don't. Ray, Danny Cash waiting for you at the bar. Danny Cash. I'll figure something out. You don't want to be part of this? Okay. Okay. Second drawer, down. Second from the right. Is it possible I didn't get that ticket? Lord, have mercy. You are the first to see it, Danny. It will be a terrific room, but it is not finished, you have to imagine it. It is a new concept. - The material is from that place - from Ethiopia. Something like that - by way of Hoboken. This was the Lunar Lounge, but with the melting of the polar ice caps This will be my masterpiece. Luigi did a bang-up job, don't you think? Polar bears' heads are there, and the glacier sculpture in the corner... This place will fly! - What about the snow blowers? - I'm going to get you one of those... - Your cousin know Brad Pitt, right? - My cousin's father's dentist knows him. - You uncle? - That's what I said! The next time he gets his teeth cleaned, I'll get the number. Watch your step. - When will it be ready? - Soon. She's terrific, huh? Mara, you want a drink? - Give everyone a drink. - Give me two champagnes. You know Danny? Well, sure. Everybody knows Danny. - Any action? - Debbie's got one.

Here's the check. Get on top of me... The thing stinks. How long has she been in there? A minimum of an hour. You got to do something, Ray. They can't lock they doors. Luigi, come on. Give me the key. Want to work with me? Your check is here, though first you have to give me a kiss. Sign it. Sign it. Sign it. Sign the check. My producer. You like that? - Who is it? - Its' Ray. Go away! I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in here. - I'm with Stanley, my producer. - Hello! That's great, Stanley because Debbie is the top client in the Ray of Hope Talent Agency. Talent agency? This is a private meeting. Go away! Stanley, mi casa es tu casa! I'm Ray Ruby and this is my place. - Thank you very much. - Don't worry. You have your check now, what do I get? - I love you, Stanley. - Then Prove it. Come close. Come over here. But that's my wife! - Paola! - What the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck am I doing here? What the fuck are you doing here? Hey! Quiet! Quiet! Take it easy! That's my wife, you know. Okay, okay - I'm fine. It's okay. Fuck! Stop! You have to calm down, understand? - Okay. - Just shut up! Get him another drink. Come on, Adrian, leave him alone. Oh my god! What happening? - Watch out! - He's with me. Give him a drink. Hurry! You look like a smart guy. Adrian speaks highly of you. "My husband is a doctor, The doctor my husband ", eh? How long has she been dancing? How long have you been in Med school? - For almost 4 years. - What do you think pays for that? How do you think she gets the money to pay for it? Adrian helps me out. But, you don't think she was... - playing around. - What are you talking about? Shut the fuck up! Listen... You're a foreign student... Look at that stage. Get him outta here! I understand. I understand your concern. but there are no prostitutes here. This is a respectable place. This is a clean, upscale operation. - You have nothing to worry about. - He's a troublemaker. - Look at it as an art form. - He's a troublemaker. - She's just a dancer. - Nothing to worry about. - Do not worry. - I'm Italian, right? That one is my wife, okay? Nothing to worry, okay? - What the fuck are you saying? - Take it easy! Take him out! Just get him out of here! Call the cops! Call the cops! Call the cops! Call the cops! He's crazy! Call the cops! I brought the kid here... I didn't know his wife was a dancer. Remind me to give Adrian a couple of days off. Jay, what would 20% of Debbie's script price plus 15% of 8 girls working for 3 weeks on a basic contract be? $800 each per girl? That comes to... $23,400. It's not nothing. Looks like she's concluded the deal. That girl has talent. I don't know about filmmaking, but... she's got something. Welcome back to Paradise. Finally! The late rush! Come in! Come in!

Of course - how could I forget? We have a wonderful show tonight. We will warm you up with our first talent, who is from Siberia. Let me introduce you to the bewitching Tania! - You can do it? You are okay? - Yeah. Wasn't she wonderful? You know what they say? A day without culture is a day without... ...you know what I'm thinking. Our next act is from Paris, France. From the ballet schools of beautiful Paris: Sophie! Make it very pretty. I like to look in the mirror and say, "I am beautiful. I have a secret and somebody loves me. " I am beautiful. I have a secret and somebody loves me. I gotta tell you, Baron - I can't take my eyes off that new girl. Where did you find her? I didn't find her. Ray found her. Ray? Now for a dramatic reading from William Shakespeare from our resident closet thespian and all-around poetic, soulful guy - Bobby G! Friends, Romans, countrymen, Lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil of men does live after them and the good is inherited in their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus has told you that Caesar was ambitious; if their was so grievous a fault and grievous has Caesar answered it here under leave of Brutus and the rest. For Brutus is an honorable man. Wow! How does he remember those lines? Our own Marlon Brando. How do we remember anything? When you forget something really important and, how do you get back? Fuck me! Fuck me Jay! Sorry, it's been a long night and I enjoy my work, but sometimes things get misplaced. I can't find things; I don't know who's doing what, but we are all happy here at Ray's Paradise Lounge! I don't know what to say. Sometimes, things are ahead of their time. So I invite you to enjoy the avantgarde artistry of our very own, Domino and Dolly. You're killing me. I'm trying to make something here. Why did you start it if you weren't going to finish it? Johnny, I swear to God I love you but sometimes... I can't even believe that you're my brother. - Ready? - Ready. I told you - something very special. The next performer is like a brother to me. In fact, he is my brother. Let's bring him on - the King of Coiffeur, Johnny Ruby! - Go, Johnny! - Thank you for the warm introduction Good evening. It's always a pleasure to perform at Ray's Paradise. Little Lupe looks forward to this every week. We haven't got the ticket. I've looked everywhere. - Did you look... - I've looked everywhere. Did you find the key? - The key is... - Put these away! You want the key? It is in the desk in the office. You go to keep the show going... Invent something, but go! I can't - I've never done it! Go! You have to do it! Hey, drinks are on Danny. - Hello, sweetheart, have a drink? - Yes Give this lady a drink. What do you want? Give Sam a beer. I need money. Ray hasn't paid me. A big round for Johnny. Big round for Johnny and his delightful animal. Next is Sally - I think. As you've noticed, I'm Irish and I'd like to tell you about the... Here's to Johnny! Remember what you told me? You get paid when I tell you, not when you want to get paid! That's not what you told me! I've worked here for 5 years! and I demand respect. But first, I need my money! In the middle of a show, no one gets paid in the middle of a show! How dare you speak to me like that! ...but enough rambling from me. Let me introduce you to the lovely, luscious Lila! Nobody gets paid in the middle of a show! How dare she speak to me like that! I've spent 5 years working for you! Debbie, calm down. Look, motherfucker - this is funny money. We need real money. Oh,no. Ray... Ah, Ray... That's right. I played the Lotto. And you know what... I won. Only I can't find the ticket, so I guess I lost. I can't cash in. People love to see other people fail. I've been in the club business all my life. Started busing tables at Lucky's in midtown when I was ten. All I ever wanted was my own place. To see my name on the marquee. This is my dream. My legacy. No one can shut me down! I made some mistakes. The hats... are a joke. The Frisbees with my face... But the problem is not business. The problem... is me. My addiction - I play the Lotto. I mean, I REALLY play. I play thousands. Now, Johnny wants to pull the plug. He wants me to go to Florida and play Gin Rummy. I I wanted a tan, I would put the proper lights in Luigi's machine and sleep in it. I'm not going anywhere. Ray Ruby's Paradise Lounge is just starting to take off. I'm sorry if hard work doesn't make you all movie stars. But everyone in this room has a chance to become more than they think they are. Freedom of expression, creativity, love - that's what this is about. I'm sorry that I lied about the gambling, but I love to gamble. I'll always gamble. Those tickets weren't really about gambling, Zoom and Nasim are like investors in the club and I'm investing in you. Baron, Luigi, everyone. We're investing in each other. Johnny, you should know about that. That's the way we were brought up. I'm not a machine. I'm human. I took a chance. What do you want from me? What do you want? I know... you want your money. Otherwise you would not be here. Fine. Come and get it. What is left of it - here it is. It's like getting blood out of a stone. What's next? Want my lucky jacket? Want to kill me? Do you want to kill my dream? Want to kill me? Want to take my heart? You want to take my heart? He fucking hit it! The hit the lottery! Get him away! Jesus Christ! Have some champagne! Hey, we've got paying customers out there! Get back to work! Half in taxes? Half? What does that leave us? - If we take the cash payout now... - Of course now. that leaves us with... Maybe we should play again next week.
