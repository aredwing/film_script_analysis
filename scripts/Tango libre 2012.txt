To go to dances to try and hook one. - Imagine, seven men for one Woman! - Watch the meat. Crazy. Seven men, one Woman. That's Wild. They were practicing. That's Why they did it. That's the true origin of the tango in Argentina. This isn't Argentina. OK, but it's still funny. It's like us. We're doing it to seduce a Woman too. Those guys were hoodlums like us. Us? Hoodlums? Are you kidding? We fucked up big time. We got 10 and 20. Got 20 years. Killed a man! - It was an accident. - An accident? Yeah, an accident. Just an accident. Want you to leave Alice be. See this? Alice is my Wife. She got married to me. Alice is my Wife, OK. The tango comes from inside, deep down. It's about temptation, seduction. It's also the soul and the heart. Suffering, anger. Frailty. Grace. If you Want to learn the tango... Do you fancy Alice? No. You don't fancy her? Did you enjoy dancing with her? Don't dance with her any more. Don't dance with her any more. Why not? It's the earth and the blood. The Tango... is freedom! OK, guys, let's go. You OK? - Out of your cage? - Give it a rest. I'm glad you're here. Come on, you'll see. You're gonna love it. Ready to give it a shot? Make me dance. - You'll listen to me? - Yeah. Good. Your hands like this. That's it... Right from the beginning you have to feel how the Weight... You feel the Weight shift from one side to the other? Wrong... With the arm... hold him like a Woman? With your arm on the other side. You need to feel safe with me. Have to lead. And make you sway... Here We go! You feel how the Weight goes from side to side? Good. Very good. What's up, Dom? Keep going. Just keep going. What? Keep going.

You feel me? - Move. - Feel my hard-on? - Don't you come to lessons any more? - No. Because of me? Don't dance Well enough for you? You're too technical. How can be less technical? Stand up.

You didn't do a thing? You've got nothing to do with it? Dom's my best friend, and you fall in love with him? You've got nothing to do with that? You never chose, Alice. You never made a choice. Love means having to choose. You don't love. You only care about yourself. Ever thought about us? Did you ever think about us? All you can do is hurt. Love isn't What you do. It's not love.
