Thanks... man! Hey, back off sisters! He's my man! Come on... Damn, that's a fine ass. What? Uh, I said... Kick some.. ass. Yeah! Kick some ass, Vin! - That's what she mean. - Yeah. Alright everyone. The race is around the factory and back. No second place. Winner takes all. Who's in? I'll race, homes. What are you staking? A case of TEC-9s. Completely untraceable. Well this is getting serious, Vin. Alright who else has the balls to race? Me! And I got 10 pounds of the prompt cheatham weed to say I'm going to win, yo. Alright... I guess this ain't going to be no friendly race. I'm about to up the stake big time. I'm bringing this bitch to a whole new level. That's right. Two words. Spa day. I'm talking the works. Aromatherapy. Shea Butter moisturizing bath. Cucumber micro-exfoliating treatment. And full body seaweed wrap. Does that shit also includes the lavender rejuvenation facial mask? What do you think? I want to race. I got the pink slip to my car that says I can take all of you. You think you can just strolled up and race. Vin Serento? What are you driving? A car. With unicorns. Let's see what're you packing under the hood. Whoa! He's got one of those big shiny things with a lot of tubes and curly curls coming out of it. With a red doeken. Vin, he's got one of those fancy thing in the jiggers. That's the real deal. But it's not the car you drive. It's the driver who's driving the car... that's doing the driving. That's right. Let him race. You heard my little sister. Let's see what you got. If you win, you get me. But.. If you lose... You get her. We've got a black guy in a white neighborhood, minding his own business. All units respond. Repeat. All units respond. We're good to go, the cops are going to be busy for a while. Yo! Start the race! Alright. Ready. Hey, white boy! You're grinding your gears. You have to stop accelerating as you put it in the first. Thanks, I've never actually driven a stick before. Go! Aww...! Oh! Damn it! Forgot to get gas! Hurry up. I'm in a race. You're not getting a tip, slowpoke. Feel the trills! If you win, you get me. But if you lose... You get her. Oh, hell no! I ain't going out like that! Too soon, rookies. My turn to jeez up. Whoa...! This is... Awesome! My bad! I'm coming for you, Serento. Oh.. Shit.. I'm going to win. I'm going to win. Did I win? Smoked them! Alright guys, pay up. Come here, puppy. What you grinning about? I almost beat you. You almost beat me? You only can't beat me, you can't even beat yourself. Not true Serento. I've beating myself since junior high. No way. You wagered a 10 sec car, you owe me a 10 sec car. Deliver to the shop tomorrow, Bitch! Polpol! Roll out! Polpol? You know five-O. Pigs, bacon, barney. The heat, the law, the fuzz, the man. No. The boys in blue. The thin blue line. Johnny Law, Smokey, Gunshoot, Flatfoot. Come on man? Haven't you ever seen an episode of of CSI or NCIS or Illinois SBU. Are they on Netflix? I'm out of here! Damn, it's the cops! Thanks for the heads up bro! Where do you think you are going? Cupcake. Take it easy. - Who were you racing with? - Nobody. I was taking a romantic midnight drive. Oh, bullshit. Give me a name. Was it Serento? Aw.. Funny now? Aw.. He's a kind of robot. Oh, yeah. Alright. Ready? Here we go! Come on, cupcake, you're done. Let's go. Give me your hands. Come on. Hey! Jeez, Hanover, you have to be so rough? I had to make it look real. Serento might had been watching. Serento ever found out I'm was an undercover cop, he would kill me. Don't worry. I erased your files. No one on the force even knows you're a cop. Your secret dies with me. It's just. Maybe I'm not the right guy for the job. I mean. I don't exactly fit in. - I'm really white. - You'll be fine. I'm so white that when I went to an all white boarding school. Nicknamed was "Cracker". - I get it. - No, I don't think you do! I love hockey. I water ski, I have a favorite lacrosse team. I have a crush on Martha Stewart. People mistake me for the WikiLeak's guy. Okay. I still buy Kid Rock albums. I put purplery sachets in my underwear drawer. I wear Crocs. I take a weekly Zumba class. Oh, for Christ sake. I cried. When 'Friends' went off the air. My favourite actress of all time, is Kristen Stewart, And my favourite movie off all time, is Pitch Perfect. Oh, dear God! I'm so white, that I put mayonnaise on sticks, and freeze them to make mayonnaise sickles. You have no family, you got no friends. You score through the roof on the criminal aptitude test. Take a look. Score higher than Charles Manson. Dexter. You score higher than Kanye. It's a fine line, which side of the law you even belong. That makes you perfect for undercover work. Or being a journalist for TMZ. I guess so. Now look, Serento and his crew are responsible for everything. From truck heist to counterfeiting Bed Bath & Beyond gift cards. There is something big going down. We think that they might be working for this man. J.lo's ex-hubby, Marc Anthony? No! That's Juan Carlos De La Sol, the criminal king pin of LA. Right... Now look. Tonight you got closest to Serento than anyone ever has. But I need you to get closer still. I need you to join their crew. So we can get the evidence that we need to take these guys down. Are you with me? That's my boy. But, how do I explain to Serento why you release me? Just tell him you beat my up and ran away. - You think he'll go for that? - Yeah, if it looks right. What do you mean? Hit me. - Come again? - Look, we got to make it look real. Like we really got into a brawl. And you knuckles got to look you had been hitting somebody. So, hit me. Oh, I can't. I mean, can't we just like.. puts some fake blood on my knuckles or something. Serento's a streetwise thug, he's going to see right through that.. Now hit me! Oh.. That hurts! I never actually hit someone before! Now do it again, and harder. Harder. Harder! Oh shit, I'm sorry. Your lips bleeding. It's nothing. Okay, my turn. What do you mean, my turn? Serento will never believe that you beat a hard detective, without taking a few beats yourself. I guess so but... Hey? You alright? You good? Yeah, you alright. Hey. You got my car 10 second car? As promised. Come on... - This thing is tiny! - Exactly. With it's light body and a beef engine, this could be... The fastest car in the circuit. But Vin, it's all busted up. It's a ton of work. Then fix it up! And you're going to help him. - Cos now you work for me. - What? We have a full medical and dental plans. We recognized same sex partnership for health benefits. And last but not least... Casual Fridays. That's when I get to wear my dope ass Hawaiian shirts. Deal with it, bitch! Alright, Vin. Where can I put my stuff? Over there. Whoa. A lot of stolen merchandise. Whoa.. Son of a bitch! Come on, drink it! Drink it, you son of a bitch! What are you doing! You're going to kill him! You know how fattening this stuff is! He's a cop! - I saw him snooping around. - I ain't not cop! You're wearing a wire! Aww.. I hate cops. I saw him get arrested last night. They beat him down trying to get him to give me up. And he never dropped a dime. - Vin! - I live by my instincts. And he's as much as a cop as my girlfriend is in the class about her true sexual identity. I can't believe this... Why don't he go out with your sister while he's at it. Pick you up at 7? It's a date. Oh, come on! Nice. Nervous? No. I am, I'll admit it. - You are? - Sure. I'm not so good at this. The whole time we're out. I'm going to be thinking about when is the right moment to kiss you. Really? I propose that we just do it now, and get it out of the way. Do the first kiss now? What do you say? Alright. - I feel better already. - Me too. So. What do you have planned for our date. I was thinking a little dinner. Sounds great. Fondue? How romantic. - May I? - Please. Sorry. Awkward first date moment. Yeah. So tell me about your brother. What do you want to know? I do not know. How does Vin have the money to pay for all those suit up cars? Does he engage in illegal activities. On regular.. basis? What is he planning to do with LA king pin Juan Carlos De La Sol? - I don't want to talk about my brother. - Right. - Let's talk about you. - What about me? What are you there? You're not a tough girl. Sure, on the outside. You have this take no shit hard exterior. But, on the inside.. You're completely different. I am? Your ideal night, is cuddling up with your snuggie. Watching your favorite movies. The Notebook, Dear John and The Human Centipede. You donate all of your extra money, to the causes closest to your heart. Save The Whales Amnesty International, No Child Left Behind Without an Xbox. And on New Year's eve, when the clock strikes midnight, Just as Ryan Seacrest ushers in the new year. When the big ball thingy. Lowers on that.. Thing. You make a wish that the new year will bring you, the true love. Flat tire. Jordana told me what went down on your date last night. About the fondue and flat tire? About the.. Relationships, You had at the back of her apartment. Sorry, Vin. It won't happen again. It better happen again. I've never seen my sister so happy before. She's glowing. Yeah. I got it. I'll be right there. Michelle, let's bounce. Vin. Vin, baby. You know I got softball every Tuesday! You're ready to take your shot? - Where are we going? - Don't ask so many questions. Why? That's another question. Why so curious? So, if I knew where we were going, I would know how to dress. Fancy, casual... nautical. Whoa. Hey, hey! You taking him over me? Thought we were BFFs. Fine. You can forget about coming over tonight and watch the season finale of the Bachelor. Cos you are no longer invited! Let's go. "Heading out. Something big going down with De La Sol." "Will monitor your activities..." On behalf of Juan Carlos De La Sol, Thank you for coming. You are here because you are the best in the city. But alas, we only need one driver. This is bullshit! To get the job... you are going to have to audition. We'll see who is the best of the best. Oh, yes. I think you know what you got to do to impress De La Sol. And to show you have the cojones.. To work for him. Vin. What's going on? Just follow my lead. Freestyle. Oh yes, yes. Come on twerk! Twerk like Miley Cyrus! Yes. Yes. Diego! Man, I had you. I totally out danced you. You never out dance me. Who're you kidding? 3 years dance repertory. Ballet, modern, contemporary and even tap. Right then, but next time... Next time. - Nice moves. - Thanks. I only need one driver. But you guys had ball so good. I decided I'm going to hire the two of you. - What's the job? - Very simple. You must drive my super car to this location. Upon delivery, you will be paid $ 100,000. - Super car? - Yeah. - She's a tiger. - I know. It's the only one of it's kind. It's priceless. You got yourself a deal. - Question. - Here we go again. Excuse me? Why don't you just drive the car yourself? I would. But I have a million unpaid parking tickets. So they raise my insurance premium. Besides that, the car is a like a cop magnet. You know. You tried Geico? 15 minutes can save you 15%. Yes. And half like it even Progressive, but it's still a little worth to have. Are you a college graduate? Cos if you are a college grad, she could be eligible for a pretty substantial discount. I once took a French league class in the college, does that count? Did you pass? No, the professor flunked me. So I shot him. Look I rather just pay criminals like yourself to drive the super car. Whenever I have to move it's location, okay? - Make sense to me. - But the math doesn't add up! You are offering us $ 100,000 in a down economy. What was your best bid from Aflac? Look! Do you want the job or not? God damn it! Yes, he does. - Let's go. - Get the fuck in the car! It's not working. Dumb car must be broken. - Your foot is on the brake. - What? Oh right... I got a bad feeling about this. Why? Listen to the score. Dissonant chord progression. Heavy use of Strings. Oboe. It all seems quite ominous. You got the money? There you go, sir. Count it. Make sure it's all there. Nah. This guy seems alright to me. Oh, oh. - I got it! - Throw it, you idiot! Not to me! I don't want it! What you waiting for, Vin. Throw it! Nah. I'm going to time it just right. So when I throw it. They will catch it. And it will explode before they have a chance to throw it back. Good thinking, right? Get ready! Wait for it. One. Two. And three. You okay? I think we got double crossed. Oh, you think so? Where're you going? Oh, shit! No! Oh, shit.. Serento ever found out I was an undercover cop, he would kill me. Don't worry. I erased your file. I'm the only one in the force who knows that you're a cop. Your secret dies with me. Oh, shit! Come on, you bastard! Take it easy. He's dead. You're a cop killer now. High five. Let's go, come on. Let's go! He killed a cop. Son of a bitch! Detective Johnson, I got some files for you to look at... This is no time for paper work. I got regular, decaf, latte... I'll drink some coffee when I solved this crime. Here are the urine samples you requested. Oh smell this! Look. People. The only thing I want right now is to know what happened here. Officer Canaro, what have you got? There is a camera. Yeah. So? So. Maybe, it recorded what happened. And then what? And then.. And then you could watch the tape. And see.. who shot him. It just might worked. Who is he? There's nothing on him. No record. Guy kills a cop, has no priors... Doesn't make any sense. Let's check the body, I want a fingerprint. What the hell is that? The black light will expose what the human eye can't see. Like what date line uses, for those exposes or Motels with dirty sheets. Covering disgusting bed bugs. Gotcha. You, son of a bitch. What? Nothing. Nothing. Where is my car? Well, Carlos. I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news, but.. I don't have it. So. You don't have my car? Well uh... The double cross didn't go as planned, per Se. Per Se? Yeah, per Se. You know. As a matter of speaking. Yeah, but you say per Se, when what you said wasn't exactly accurate. So what happened? The double cross didn't go as planned. So, Not per Se after all. I guess not. Not per Se. And that! That! Per Se! I have more information. Senor. I was going to tell you, but you stabbed me. Yeah well, you must always kill the messenger. That's sort of how we work, right? Si, Si. I understand, but... Quick. Make him comfortable. Bring a pillow and some coconut water. Here. - Bless you. - This pillow is down filled! I'm allergic! You have a hypoallergenic one? I don't know. Perhaps cotton or I don't know.. Something in the soft, microfiber. Thank you. There, feel better now. It will help to replenish your electrolytes. It's filled with mango and peach. Feel better now? Oh, Serento. He shot the other three. I barely got out with my life... Serento, huh. Get rid of him. Carlos... Madre de Dios, Que me asust! I wasn't done. Forgive me please. I constantly interrupt people. It's a terrible habit, I'm working on it. But my therapist says it's a form of narcissism. Anyway, you were saying? I know where Serento and his crew hideout. It's at the warehouse of... I interrupt again, didn't I? Yeah. Therapy is a process. Get my car. As for Serento and his crew. Kill them all. I have more information, senor. Alright people. We are in serious lock down mode. No one leaves the garage. De La Sol is out to kill me, and the rest of you. How can you be so sure? By follow my Tweeter. Check this out. A Tragedy has occurred. Where a veteran detective has been brutally murdered. Come on, you bastard! Police had been ordered to shoot this man. Police are also encouraging Angelenos to take the law into their own hands. If you see this man, please shoot him, stab him, or if the opportunity arises, slap him upside the head. Oh, come on! What? - We have to get out of here. - Go where? Some place where no one would find us. Some place with no extradition, like Tokyo or Rio or Florida. You are talking fake passports, plane tickets, living off the grid... We don't have that kind of money, Vin. Then we need to get some money, fast. Or we're all dead. Ideas? How about we moved to San Francisco and open an alternative lesbians coffee shop. What? I'm just big ballin. Why don't we just sell this bitch super car. We'll be rich! Boom! Problem solved, bitch! Great idea, if it were actually a "super car". What? 87 octane? Super cars only run on premium. I know it. Why would De La Sol have us drive this car unless it was valuable. Something smells fishy. It's a break down of all De La Sol's illegal activity. Records of bribes to corrupt politicians, where he houses his hoes, Where he keeps his stash of money worth over a $100 million. Wait... That's it! Right! We go to the house where he keeps his hoes and we keep it. We steal his $100 million. And get out of town for good. Who's in? I'm in. Boss, I got the lunch. Thank God, I'm starving. What is this? Burger and fries. Yeah I can see that. I'm not blind! But I ordered a kid's meal. I'm sorry. You know that I've been collecting the 'Despicable Me' minions. - I told you. You know that. - Yes I have them all, except for Carl. I have Jerry, I have Stuart, I have Kevin, Dave, but I needed Carl. Carl says. "Bee-doh! Bee-doh." And you forget about it. I need the BeeDoh BeeDoh guy, to complete my collection! Okay, I go back. I go get a new one. No, no, no.. I don't even want it anymore. Robbing Juan Carlos' of a $100 million, ain't going to be easy. If we are going to pull off this heist, we're going to need a bigger crew. First thing first, we need a black guy. As Ja Rule or Bow Wow or Ludacris. Why does he have to be a rapper? Cos movies like these always have a rapper doing the cameo. It brings in the urban demographic. Dummy. Plus, they get to do a soundtrack title. Hey, what about uh .. Lil Wayne, T.I., DMX, Gucci Mane and Akon? No, all those guys are either on their way to jail or just getting out of jail. We'll film a reality show that chronicles going to jail and then getting out of jail. And then go back to jail. I got it. I know the perfect guy to do the cameo. And we need an Asian guy. - Some one who can drift? - Because Asian guys are cool. And last but not least, we need a beautiful model making her future acting debut.. She's not going to have a lot of lines or a lot to do. But she's smoking hot. Fine to look at. MODEL TURNED ACTRESS - How do you do that? - What? You describe them and then like instantly they're here. Well, I had to. It's a classic multi-ethnic round up scene. It's in every Fast & Furious movie. Plus, I like to give my heist a sort of United Colors of Benetton feel. Now let's get down to business. Alright, these are the blueprints to the building. De La Sol is holding his $100 million in. Does anyone have any idea. How to read a blueprint? Oh, damn dog of my. That's not what you asked me. You said, can I drive fast and can I use a gun. - Damn! - So many numbers. Right, then I say we go over there and see for ourselves what we are up against. You, Rapper Cameo and Cool Asian Guy. Let's roll. Wait! I'm not going? No, why don't you stay behind with the girls. Killed him. That was our secret handshake! - Now it's his. - Deal with it. Bitch! There's something I need to talk to you about when you get back. Can you give me a hint? Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop. When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. Okay... When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. And down will come BABY... cradle and all. Oh my God! Are you serious? You taken up singing. You should totally try out for The Voice. Avril Lavigne is going to love you! When a man and a woman make love, sometimes there can be, unintended consequences. I know exactly where this is heading. And I want to talk to you about it. Great. Cos I'm pretty sure you gave me herpes. I'm... We'll talk about this later. Who are you? Where is the rest of the money? What do you mean? It's all here. Watch out! I'm on it, bro. De La Sol's stash is worth over a $100 million. Where is it? - Who's De La Sol? - Who's De La Sol. Aw... You think I was born yesterday? Question. Is this 1414 Becker Street? This is 1414 Becker Lane. What's with all the cash? We're a church, it was Bingo night. I am the pastor, you asshole! Que Paso? Someone just robbed the church on Becker. I know they wanted my money. You think it was Serento? Duh! He thinks he can steal my money? Listen to me, Cesar. Please pay attention. - I want my building guarded. - Okay. Put the money in the strongest vault there is. And kill Serento. - You got it? - I got it, boss. Lo Qu es, El medio parte Que? What? Uh.. Building.. guarded. No..no. The vault? No, no. Not that, the.. - Kill Serento? - Right! Now I understand. Guard the building and put Serento in the vault! I'll just better text you the needs, mijo. It's for the best. Now, now you have instructions in your cellphone. - I didn't get it. - But I already sent it! No. Aye! You have the 4G network? Yes. Of course. I'm still under the 3G, it's much slower. How can I run a major criminal empire.. And not having the same network? Well uh, in three months. My contract is going to end. And then I plan to upgrade to the newest network. But in 3 months, that would be 5G! Okay. How about you give me your phone. And then you get a new one. - I'm going to kill you. - We go now. They're wearing ski masks. They must have gone skiing immediately before or after the crime. Contact the Aspen police, the Canadian Mounties, and Whistler in the Swiss Alps special forces. See what they know. Right sir. And take a look at this. That's Vin Serento. He's involved too. Triangulate the area. I want every available officers to be on the lookout for these guys. Serento's chop shop must be close by. And for God sake. Someone get me some more baby oil! How is it going on fingerprint match? Uh, still nothing. Wherever you fugitives are, I'll find you. You hear me? I will find you! How about this t-shirt? Sir? Is it tight enough? Is it tight enough? Yes, I mean I can see your nipples and everything. You're damn right. That's what I'm going for. Alright. Here's the deal. 1414 Becker Street, is a Mexican restaurant, called Big Ass Tacos. De La Sol's using it as a front. I love Big Ass Tacos. It's a perfect cover. While unsuspecting customers chow down, De La Sol got a secret room at the back. De La Sol's stash must be there. Cos they brought in "The strongest Vault There is." A vault big enough to hold a $100 million plus. But this place is locked down harder than Lindsay Lohan's liquor cabinet. If they see us, we're dead. But I got a foolproof plan. That's going to get us the money. And they'll never know what hit them. First, we need eyes on the inside. That's where Jordana and Michelle come in. Now before you get into the vault, there is a counting room. De La Sol doesn't trust the counter from stealing. So to make sure they are not hiding cash in their clothes. He makes them all work butt naked. Everyone's nude. Even the guards. You two will get jobs as new counters. Wait. All of these girls are totally naked and super hot? Perfect tits. Every last one of them. Continue. Now everyday at 3 o'clock, right after he finishes watching Judge Judy. De La Sol comes in to check on the money in the vault. Michelle, you improvise a distraction. The guard rush over. Alone, Jordana will slip away and spy on. De La Sol as he opens the vault. What you'll find is that. The vault is encrypted with a high tech DNA code that matches De La Sol's. So. We need a sample of De La Sol's DNA. If we're going to get into that safe. Come On! Get out of here! Out! De La Sol takes a 10 mile run every morning through the city. And that's where Model Turned Actress and Cool Asian Guy come into play. Model Turned Actress will drive by getting De La Sol's attention. And he will say something like.. "Nice boobies." Then Cool Asian Guy will appear and say something like.. "Did you just said 'nice boobies' to my girlfriend?" And he will reply: "I don't know, it's that your girlfriend?" "Yup." "Well then, I said 'nice boobies'." That's when you have to defend her honor. "So then I must defend her honor and challenge you to a... "Karate fight." Oh, cos I'm Asian. You automatically assume I know karate? Do you? Yeah, I'm a 3rd degree black belt. That's a total coincidence. Anyway, you'll fight him. You will do spinning windmills. Leg sweeps, and flying side kicks. Then De La Sol will start working your face like a punching bag. All in the effort to get De La Sol to build up a nice sweat. So Model Turned Actress can collect DNA sample from his upper ass crack. Ass crack? The purest form of DNA. Now that we have a sample of his DNA, we can unlock the safe. How we ever get near the vault to open it? That's where you come in, Rapper Cameo. We're going to give you the DNA sample to unlock the vault. Shove you in a box and shipped you there. Say what? We'll send you ground. 3 to 5 days shipping. 3 to 5 days? We looked into overnight. But the rate was outrageous. Come on, man! You will get delivered and placed by the vault, waiting further instructions. That brings us to Curtis. You'll be the decoy. You'll knock on the door. And when the guards open up. You tickle him. - Did you say tickle? - Did I stutter? You'll run around the alley dodging bullets. And that will draw the other naked guard to rush outside and shooting you. When Rapper Cameo hears all the gun fire, he'll pop out like jack in a box. He'll run over to the door and lock out the guards. He'll then use the ass crack DNA sample to unlock the vault. Now back outside, Curtis will finally get shot. Get shot? Yes. And mainly in the groin. And when the guards go to check to see if Curtis is finally dead... I die? We pull up. Catching them off guard, and take them out. Rapper Cameo opens up from the inside, We load up the cars with the cash. Then me and bro, rendezvous with Jordana, Michelle, Model Turned Actress, Rapper Cameo and Cool Asian Guy, in an extradition free exotic locale. And the best part of the plan? No casualty what so ever. Except for Curtis. Of corse. Son of a... So, what do you say? Okay, second idea. We bust in, blow open the vault and drive off. - Yeah! Uh-huh. - That's good. - Yeah! I like that, plan B. - I like that one. I'm down with that. Yeah, yes. We ride at dawn. Dawn, really? What's wrong with dawn? It's so early, dawn is before breakfast. Yeah. And I am no good without breakfast. Fine. We ride after breakfast. How about we all go out for breakfast. iHop would be fun? - Yeah! - Yeah. That's good, that's good. Their pancakes are the bomb. We ride... after iHop. Hey Curtis. Did you finish fixing up the Smart car? What you think? Nice. Real nice. And I got a little something for you. Thanks, man. My unicorn car! - What? - You fixed it up? For me? Surprise. No. It's a simple gesture. To show how special you are to us. Giving your sweeten loving present to him. What's his name? Mom was right. I should have joined an ordinary motorcycle gang instead! What a baby... I still need to talk to you. Before you do. There's something I need to tell you. I know what's going on. - You do? - Of course. Every one does. It's not like you have done a very good job at hiding it. You don't know what a relief that is. - You're fat! - Excuse me? I'm sorry, but it's obviously you got quite a muffin top going on. Jeez, you look like a fat Jonah Hill! Wait, Jonah Hill might actually be skinny now. Let me think. Fat in Superbad, Really fat in Moneyball, then in 21 Jump Street... I don't know if he is fat or thin. I'm so confuse now. Anyway, have you no pride in your appearance? - I am pregnant. - Why didn't you tell me? What car is this? It's my old man's car. He died in it. You guys get along? He was the best. I never knew my father. He went out for a pack of smokes... And he never came back? No, he came back and told me to "Smoke up, because he was leaving." I was 8 years old. You were just a kid. It wasn't your fault. He kind of said it was. He said before I was born, He used to have sex with my mom all the time. They would go out and see movies. Travel to interesting places like Naper Valley or Belize, But now, he couldn't do anything fun anymore. But you still had your mother. Wow, he made such compelling argument that she left too. - You grew up in an orphanage? - And from foster home to foster home. Seems that no one wants a perfectly good blue eye white baby anymore. Unless you are from Namibia with flies buzzing around your eyeballs. You are no good to anyone. You can't fight celebrity trends. Brangelina, Madonna, Sandy Bullock, they all have black babies.
