And Smash, our director. - I loved the script. - Thank you. Very nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. - So, get it started. Should we try? - Sure. We are only now doing the monologue, not the first and second scenes. Oh, okay. So, you just lost your mom and you're cursing God. Do you have any questions? No, I'm okay. Do you have any answers? Just really take this time to put yourself in this place. The air is humid. There's black bugs in the tree. The... What? - Ocusts? - Ocusts, chopping the... You may be in front of the old plantation house. It's... I used to think about you when he hurt me. You weren't there. You never were. Things were so different then. The bayou was open... so free. Sitting on that front porch I looked into your eyes and stared for hours. Et me just stop you for a sec. You must remember I'm taping this on digital video. So it's very important that you think very raw. It's... Just start again and think that your acting must be very raw... very... Got it. You weren't there. You never were. Things were so different then. The bayou was open... so free. Sitting on that front porch, I stared into your eyes for hours. That terrible night... when the storm ripped and screamed through everything. The abuse, the denial, the redemption! We shared it all. You were my rock... my salvation. You... were me. And now you're dead, you bitch! I don't know if it's possible to go on. I do not will to stand! Oh, God, damn you to hell! Why? Why? Why? Wow! That was wonderful. Very good, excellent. Very good. Are you sure? I can try another way. I mean, this is such a... How tall are you? I'm 5'7. This tall. How tall is Mel? About this height. He wears his lifts in his shoes, so no one will know. All right, Ellie. That was great. Thanks for coming. Okay, thank you. It was nice to meet you all. - Thank you. - I loved the script. It's great. My keys. - Bye. - Bye. - Was that okay? - It was great. It was really great. I kind of wanted to do those other scenes. No, that was everything. It was totally fine. - They're really nice. - Oh, yeah, they're great. - The director. What was his name? - Smash. Cool. He seems interesting. Well, you'll be hearing from us. You know, we'll be in touch. - Thanks for coming. - Thanks. Great to see you again. - All right. - All right, see you later. "Sitting on that front porch, I stared in your eyes... " et me in, fuckers! Won't you mistrust Love's gone behind In between Oh, fuck! I sucked your cock! I sucked Vinnie's cock! I sucked them all! I fucked your cock, I sucked it. I was there. I was there. It went okay? So what about yesterday, did you get feedback? Fucking tell them that I didn't fucking respond to them either! That fucking dick wad! Hold on, can you? Dennis, hold on. Hello. Hi, honey. Where are you? Baby, I'm just in the car, driving, on the freeway. I'm late to my second appointment. "The Cruel City". Fuck it, I don't know what it's called. It's a piece of shit anyway. But it's a good part. Dennis, hi. Dennis, sorry, I completely forgot. Maybe you could call and say I'm gonna be 5 minutes late. Isten, you know when they said they didn't respond to me... was that my look, was that... what, performance? All right, I'll call you after, okay? All right, bye. I just gotta be some junkie fucking whore, like New York. I sucked his cock, Vinnie's cock! I sucked them all! Does that accent sound all right? I'm not good at the Brooklyn thing... but I did this Southern belle thing and I fucking nailed it. I was... Don't make me tell you what I've just been through, okay? 'Cause I... Vinnie had blood all over his fucking shirt! Don't make me tell you... Don't make me tell you what I've been through. Fuck! Don't make me tell you what I've just been through. Vinnie had blood all over his fucking shirt! No... Don't make me tell you what I've just been through, okay? 'Cause Vinnie had blood all over his fucking shirt! Baby, I... You said this before. We've gone through this. We've gone through it. What am I supposed to do? Do you want me to pull over... and just park and listen to you, what you have to say... while I'm on my way to a fucking audition trying to earn some money? I know. What do you expect me to do? How can I not get emotional when... Don't hang up on me! Don't! Motherfucker! Vinnie, I sucked your cock. He had blood all over his fucking shirt! You try going from Avenue A to Belford Stiverson in 10 minutes. You try. You try it. I sucked his cock. I sucked his cock. He had blood all over his fucking shirt! I sucked his cock. I sucked it good. Fuck! - Hi. - Hi, how are you doing? Sign in. - Great. - Can I get you some water or coffee? If I have any coffee, my head will explode. Water's fine. Thanks. Have a seat over here. I'll get this mess. - Joann will be right with you. - Thanks a lot. - Hi. - Hi! You look lovely. - Thanks. - Good to see you. I won't kiss you cause I've got a cold, I don't want you to catch it. The director is in Vancouver, we're going to put you on tape. That okay? All right. Okay. So you can just take a sit here. And we'll tape you. - Okay. So I'm reading with you? - Yes. - You get a chance to read the script? - Yes, I did. Can we...? Sorry, that light is really bright. Can we...? Thanks. - How's that? - That's great. Et's see what happens here. I'm just getting my hair a little... Do you have any questions? No, I just... Does she love him or she sort of... I would say it's very much a love-hate relationship. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I just wasn't like... sure. I did this like weird hair and make-up... It looks great. No, I really like it. A junkie whore. I should be talking in my American accent, my New Yorker accent. - Not right now. Once we go on tape. - Okay. - So, ready? - Yeah. Is it okay if I stand? Absolutely, I mean... Trixie can move around and... You do what you want. Don't worry about it You should stand up with her. Trixie? - I'm almost ready. Here we go. - Ens cap. Oh, right, here we go. Ellie Parker. Okay. I'm ready. - Goddamn it, you were late! - There wasn't time! You try getting from Avenue A to Belford Stiverson in 10 minutes! You make time. Don't make me tell you what I've just been through, okay? 'Cause Vinnie came home with blood all over his fucking shirt! Don't care if there's blood coming out of your twat. You fucking be there. I was there! I sucked his cock, Vinnie's cock, I sucked your fucking flacid cock! You were doped up beyond belief, do you remember? You know the arrangement, you were late. We're having dinner at uigi's. I ain't hungry. You wouldn't be, you junkie whore. - That was lovely. - Are you sure? We could try it another way, I mean... Not for me. Unless you want to. It was perfect. In my point of view, you just nailed it. Really? Okay. Excellent. All right, good. - So, it was nice to see you. - Well, it was great to see you. It'd be great to meet the director, if you think... I love the script. - You wrote it, right? - Yeah. Yeah, it's good. Okay, all right. That's it for another day. Okay, have fun. - You too. - Bye. - We'll get back to you the weekend. - Okay. I'd love to meet the director. I know. He's really sorry he couldn't be here. All right, see you later. Bye. Sir, I think it's obviously quite deliberate. It was the intention of the artist. The show is called "Peripheral Perspectives". It's supposed to be out of focus. How could've it gone out of focus once you got it home? Would you mind just holding for me for a minute, please? Dumb fuck! Oh, darling. Bad day? Ook at you. Come here. You're going to be fired if you keep calling people "stupid fucks". I hope I get fired so I can just dedicate myself to my acting. What's going on? I don't know who I am. Nobody knows what they are. Maybe what you do is who you are. But I don't know what I'm doing! Maybe I don't know who I am or... what I'm doing. I don't know how anyone can have a sense of self in this... fractured modern time of mediate... tiranized, fascist, body-obsessed... global domination, political turmoil, human... - Okay, Sam. ... this time of human depravity... Sam, okay, okay, okay, stop. Are you okay? Yeah. - What the fuck is that? - Don't even try to understand it. It's pretty sophisticated piece. - Go fuck yourself. - What if I could. Oh, God, I got another audition. What for? I don't know, some WB show. "Undercover Gimnasts". Ove you. Well, why aren't I going out on that? Thank you! We want you If your lover's cold Hey, baby, I didn't know that you were home. I wasn't. Did you notice that? I like your hair. I like that. I like the radiating things, and the antennas, and the butterflies. That's really nice, I like that. Pink and blue. It's like male/female. Are you alright? What? What did I say? I liked it. I didn't say I didn't like it. What? What's the matter? Are you mad at me or something? You wanna talk about it? I think you broke my nose here. Hello? - Come on, man? - No! You come on, Justin! - "You come on". - You're a fucking wanker! I'm a fucking wanker. I'm kidding. What are you so pissed off about? Come on, don't you wanna play? Fuck! Come on! Man, I came up with this great song. I just finished it. It's really cool. It's like this... Got this ynyrd Skynyrd vibe... but I threw a little of Darby Crash, from the Germs in... and a little bit of like... There's some Zeppelin, and there's a little bit of Iggy Pop vibe going. It kind of goes like this... Simple pause. Isn't that fucking cool? I love that. I think it can really work, you know. Maybe you can help me come up with another thing, another riff, like: "I love you" or "hate you", whatever... 'cause, you know, love is about hate too, right? - It's good, it's good. - I think so too. I think I don't want to be in this relationship anymore. No, I'm sure I don't wanna be. But I don't wanna be alone. I feel suffocated. What is suffocating you? This city. It's that I feel like... I'm waiting for my life to start, you know? Ike what's going on now is all just like a big rehearsal... for something bigger. It's all temporary. It's just... Maybe I'm scared to start my life. Are you the part of Ellie that's scared to let her start her life? I wore dirty clothes... and then I smelled... and because they said... I looked like a kangaroo. Thank you for talking to me today. We'll talk to you again soon, okay? - Bye-bye. - Bye. And I was always on the outside, always trying to fit in, always... trying to be accepted, to be liked and pleasing people. That's what happens as an actor in the rooms. You go into these rooms and... you audition and you have to show yourself and... these people don't like you and it's like you can't... you can't be yourself because you're always being judged. I wish I could be brave enough to do that in the audition room. Fuck! Ellie, you have some mascara... - Here? Both eyes. That would've been strange walking into my next audition... like that. Oh, God, I hadn't let go like that in a long time. - It's good for you. - It is. It feels good. So... ...thank you. It was really good. - You're welcome. - I like your sweater. - Oh, thank you. - It's nice. Where did you get it? - At imited. All right. Oh, good, good. How much was it? Oh, gosh... 29 dollars. That's great. I might just... Was it just recently? 'Cause I've been looking for a nice cheap sweater that... You know, a plain black sweater. So, Wednesday? - Thank you. - Anything else? - That's great. - Oh, no. Oh, my God, I'm gonna cum. Oh, my God! Oh, God, yeah, like that. Gosh, like that. Oh, God. Ellie! Hey, you motherfucker! Hey, baby. I tried to call your new cell phone. Were there any calls for me? No, no, not one. Ellie... Yikes! You fucking asshole! - Oh, my God! - Ellie, wait! Fuck! Wait! Fuck! Fucking... No, no, no! Oh, God. Asshole. Fucking asshole. I just fucking hit somebody. - I just... - You're fucking crazy? - Ook at my fucking car! - I'll call you back. Oh, my God, look at my car! What do you...? You're fucking crazy? - I just hit somebody. - Can you get off that phone? Fucking hell, I'm really sorry. I didn't see you, I was on my phone. You shouldn't fucking drive while you're talking on the cell. If you wanna talk, go home. Don't drive and talk on the phone. I'm sorry. - Do you have pen and paper? - You have blue stuff on your face. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Et me just back up. I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving. - Are you sure you're okay? - I've got your number plate. - Do not drive away. - I promise I won't drive away. - Wow, my car is fine, so... - Well, that makes sense. You wanna try to maybe snap this back on? Try to drive home. It won't touch here. I'll get... - Wow, what are these things? - It's very expensive that dress. These are my pills, they are homeopathic, they're for... healing... - You're an actress? - Yes. - I like your picture. - Thanks. I'm incredibly sorry. I'm really sorry. Don't worry. Don't worry about this. It's fine, it's cool. I'll give you my phone number... Okay, I can't give you my phone number, but if you give me yours... - I'll give you mine and... - I got your license plate... and I'd like your driver's license number. - Okay, cool. - Okay. - So... - I'm really sorry. - I'll give you my phone number. - Okay, great. Make sure when you call say it's about the car accident. Okay. Are you under house arrest or something? No, I'm just... I'm breaking up with my boyfriend. It's just... - What did you say you do? - You didn't ask me. - Sorry. You asked me. - I'm a cinematographer. Oh, really? In films? No, I want to. I'm shooting commercials right now. - Oh, nice. - But I'd like to shoot films. Sometimes cinematographers turn into filmmakers, don't they? Yeah. There are a lot of people... who were cinematographers and now they're filmmakers. If you wanna do any kind of experimental ideas... or whatever, shoot it, just make a short film, I'd love to. - Really? That's great. - I'm gonna give you my head shot. Oh, great. - You look better. - Well, then don't take this. Here's the bit with my agent's number, keep that. Is it an eye? Can I have an eye? Oh, I like this part, that's really nice. - You could do that... - That's good. But I still... You know, you're welcome to stay for as long as you need to. Thanks. At least you won't have to listen to those stupid songs anymore. Or have to watch him play guitar. - That's awful. - It's like watch him masturbate. That's so beautiful. God, I just wish I could disappear into some great role, you know? Not just a cop, or a lawyer, or a girlfriend. I wanna play a real person, you know? God, it's so dry out there. We really need some rain. You know what would be great? To play a schizophrenic woman. A blind lesbian anthropologist. Yeah, yeah. It's the 1700's, and she's got dengue fever, and she's... studying baboons. Wouldn't that be good? - Lf I should I hire a lawyer? - Maybe... - What's that fucking noise? - Don't know. Someone should shoot. I feel like Humpty Dumpty. Maybe I should hire a publicist. Maybe I should set myself on fire. Who? - Where are you? - I'm sorry. You know, I think I'm a little hypoglycemic. Ook at me, shaking. I need some food, quickly. I haven't eaten for like 2 hours. Come on, let's go. Isten. - Isten. - I think it's Justin. Fuck, Ellie! - Hi. Et me in. - No! - Go away! - You said you loved me. - What? - You said you loved me. Fuck you! I don't hate myself enough to love you! I hate you. I'm fucking trying to sleep. Fuck you! Cock breath, I don't know what kind of soap opera you think you're in... Fuck off, you fucking cow. How's that? Fuck me? Fuck me? Fuck you! Justin. Sam! Honey... Go, she's coming! She's coming! Fuck. How dare you come here after what you've done to her... and how dare you call me a cow? Fuck off! - Fuck off! - Don't hurt him! - Get in! - Are you all right, Justin? - He has a violent history. - All right. I want my green shirt back. That's good. He was retarding you, Ellie, and this... He was this fucking... It'll be good for you to stay alone for a while. No, no, no. I'm gonna go insane if I'm alone. I just wanna be in a relationship where I can be myself, you know? I don't have to be what I think the man wants me to be. We live in a place where everyone is pretending to be someone else. What happens when you start becoming the person you're pretending to be? Well, I think you become the person that wears mini skirts. That's... I like that. You know, the thing is it's gonna be good for your work, Ellie. This shit informs it, you know that. Once you get passed it, think about what it will bring to the roles. And probably you'll get better roles from it. - Don't you think? - Yeah, you could be right. Right. I've got a couple of good rolls. I wouldn't complain about those rolls. What about that roll? That's one great roll. Isn't it? That's a roll I'll never get. No, you'll just get stuck with old big parts. This is what it must feel like to have a cock. I wish I had a cock. Why? That's so unfair! That's so 70's of you. Remember when the future was a promise? Now it's like a threat. You think I look old? Don't be ridiculous. I don't wanna die. What are you saying? What are you saying? What if, what if I... I... dropped dead? What if I had cancer? What if I... had an aneurism? What if? I would be so sad if you died. I would go to your funeral. - You do? - I'd get a new dress. I'd pound your coffin and try to scream: "Get up! Get up! Give me one last hug!" - You're making like it's a scene. - No, I'm just serious. I don't want a scene. I'm serious. No, I love you, darling. I love you. I love you. You're my best friend. Now just picture you're in a big bathtub filled with Jell-O right now. Orange Jell-O. Et every part of yourself just sink into the floor. Et go of your Hollywood crap... trying to be Gwyneth Paltrow or Brad Pitt... your agents, your casting directors. Just let them all go up into a big ball of fire. Okay, now I want you to ask your creative source to give you an event. An event when you were 10 years-old. You can go right into that event, as if you were in a time machine. Really be there. Good, Ellie. Et go of the tension on your face. This is not a therapy session. This is acting. Good, you're 9 years-old, vomiting. There's no one there to help you. Et it all relax. Ook at me. Esbian. - Go! - Esbian! Esbian! Esbian! - Good. - It's not appropriate! - It's not appropriate! - Good. And just say like a little scream into your pillow. A little scream. My little brother was standing there with one of my Barbies in his hand. And her hair was on fire. Stop it, Toby! And he was burning my curtains. Beautiful. That was beautiful. Then we sit down at the dining room table, like she tells us to. And she brings these huge plates. Plates... pilled high: Steak, chips... carrots, peas, like this enormous amount of food. And we're like: "Mom, what are you doing? What are you doing? No!" And she's like force-feeding us, putting it in our mouth. Good, take it and put it in your mouth., "You eat it, girls! You eat! You must eat!" Take a big handful. The other handful. Another handful. Good. Big peas. Spit out the peas. Good. - And when I... - Take the peas back, off the plate... stuff them in and spit them out. Ellie, don't hold back. Spit them out. Mush the food. Keep mushing. Turn that fucking cell phone off. Is it? Mush it! And we would say: "Mom, mom, no, we already had dinner!" We had dinner tonight. Don't you remember?" Nice. Now, get up. Don't get indulgent. Gesture. Good, again. Ellie, quiet. Do the opposite. Opposite. Good, good. And now the opposite of that. Go! Angry! Give me a hug. Very good. Yeah, Ellie! Okay, lastly, we're all gonna work at animals for about 5 minutes. A kangaroo. Et's see you hop, shake your butt. I'll be right back. You think Meryl Streep had to do this shit? You look very preoccupied. I'm fine. You're still there. What's the matter? Are you bummed he didn't offer you a line? Everyone had these big personal events. Mine was lame. I'm an idiot. That's ridiculous, Ellie. You were very, very good today. Easy for you to say. Yours was huge. You burned your house down with your brother. You never even told me that. No wonder you're such a good actress. You have all this shit in your life that you can just draw off from. It's deep. And I'm just like this shallow bird bath. - I made it up. - What? I made it up, my personal event. You made up your personal event? Come on, Ellie! You know I like to practice my American accent in class. Sometimes I make things up so I can practice my acting! What's the point? It defeats the purpose. The whole point is to... use something that really happened in your life and put it in your acting. Oh, bullshit. I think the whole method thing is a wank. I think sense memory is so self-indulgent. No, see, it's not. You draw from your life experience... and you personalize it and put it into your work. It makes it real... and it makes it honest. And that's how you make a scene work. Bullshit, Ellie! Sorry! How many times are you gonna cry about your drunk mother? It's boring! It's far more real, truthful and honest if you use your imagination. And it's limitless. Okay. Et's try something. Et's put your theory to test. Et's see who can cry first. - On the count of three. - All right. One, two... three. I'm starting to get one. It's not real. It's crocodile. Yeah, it is. It's real, right now. It's gonna spill out in a second. - You're not crying. - Yeah, one on the left eye. You see, that's dignifying 'cause I don't have to use any loud whaling... and it looks like I'm holding back. - My nose is going too. - I'm drawing from my own pain. You don't understand, see? Ook at this. You think that's faking it? I think that gets a little embarrassing. It's dignifying about holding back and letting one just spill out... gently. It's something real, Ellie! You don't understand. That shop! You see that shop? - I wanna go there. - What? I wanted to go there for so long. I'm so glad that that's there. - Oh, hang on. What... - Hang on, I can't park here. I didn't bring my wallet. Oh, I need a set of tea trays. - I'll be right out! - It's okay, we're fine. Just looking around. I hear Australians. You guys are everywhere. If he says "good day", I'll kill him. Good day. - May I help you? - Oh, my God, hi! - I didn't realize you worked here. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, how are you? - I'm good, how are you? - I'm good. My car is gonna be fixed by the end of the day. And I have a dentist appointment on Thursday. Sam, this is Chris. Chris, right. He crashed into me last week. No, no, I'm Tom, I'm Chris's twin brother. And he look really crashed into. I heard about you. Wait. Funny. No, I really am Tom, his twin brother. Happens all the time. People think we're the same person, but we're not. We have different hair. And he drives a Honda Civic, and I don't drive because I'm epileptic. So... - Oh, my God. - What? Wow, you guys look a lot alike. - Yeah. So, how is your car? - It's good, it's getting fixed. You paid... No, your brother paid for it, and it will be fixed. I know he felt real bad about what happened and... He's a terrible driver, just awful. He's always banging into stuff. I'm a better driver than he is and I don't drive, I'm epileptic. But it's good to meet you. I'll tell him I saw you. - Yes, yes, say hi. - Sure. It's weird. - I know, it's weird. - Yeah, he really... - I have to go, I got that thing. - What thing? Sorry, we should go. She's got a thing, so... - Well, good luck on your thing. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, my God! Shit! Shit! Hi, I'm sorry, I just... I am Chris, I lied. I'm sorry. I was embarrassed because I told you I was a cinematographer. I'm really embarrassed. You busted me where I work and I feel really... I'm really ashamed of myself, I'm really sorry. I just... I didn't want you to get away. - Are you an epileptic? - No, I lied about that too. - Oh, no! - Wait, wait! - Wait! - I just... I go to AFI and I'm going to be a cinematographer. And I'm just... I'm really sorry. I really like you and... Okay, don't worry. You're crazy, but it's okay. I feel really bad. Can I make it up to you? Isten, my band's playing tonight. Well, my friends' band, Dogstart. They're really good. And I'd love it if you went with me. - Okay. - You too. You both can come. So, I have your number. I'll call you when I get out. It could be great. She's a very popular girl, you know that. You're luck she's available. - Thank you, Sam. - Really, very. Bye! Just your type. Sociopath. Oh, my God, this is really fake. for me anymore. At least not orally. Really? Have you tried Norco? - Were you just talking about Vicodin? - Pretty good. Yeah. I love Vicodin. I'm like Marilyn Monroe. - Really? - Oh, my God, wait! Acting class! - Right. - What are you doing here? - Of course I'm here. - Yeah, right. I love your glitter. - It's what drag queens wear? - Can I have another vodka? Hey, you guys were great tonight. That was really cool. How you doing? - This is my friend Ellie. - Hi, hi. - And this is Sam. - That was so great. Really good. - One second. - Are you in the band? - He's in the band too. - You're in. Nice to meet you. You know what's really funny? So many people who want to say hello to you. - Yeah? From where? - Sydney, from the Matrix. - So many, so many people. - We're Australian. - Come with me, please. - Yeah, sure. What's up? - Who? - I'm so glad you took him out. - Anyway, the concept was fantastic. - So good. How did you get in acting? What? What? What are you doing? You're really, really drunk and you're embarrassing yourself. - What are you talking about? - You don't... What are you smoking? Isten, did you take something. - Don't laugh at me. Did you? - Yes. - What did you take? - Vicodin. I knew you did. You took it out of my medicine cabinet, didn't you? Ellie, did you take a Vicodin out of my... - You know, I had four there... - Just loosen up. ...that I had been saving. That's just entitlement. Oh, my God! I think Keanu likes me. - You're just transparent. - I'm sorry. Obvious. Ellie? Ellie Parker? Ellie, hey... Give me one minute. - Fuck you! - No, wait. Wait, come on. Et me talk to you about this, please. No, please. - Rot in hell! - Ellie, give me a minute! You have a callback. I've been trying to get in touch with you. - Don't fuck with me. - I'm not. It's for "Delta Breeze". They really wanna see you on this. You have a really good shot. - Wait. - It's on Friday. - Hello? - Ellie. - Sam! - Excuse me. Ellie, Friday! - Oh, my God, where are you? - I have a ride home. Which one? Yeah, all right, bye. - Sam, wait. Slut! - Hi, sorry. I was looking for you. They kicked me out. I know the guys and they kicked me out of the place. This gorilla just grabbed me and like threw me out. - I told him I've known them for... - I lost you, I'm sorry. You okay? Can I give you a ride home or something? - No. I just wanna sit here. - Okay. - You wanna keep drinking? - Yeah! - Wait, can you drive? - Well, I'm too drunk to walk. Oh, for a muse of fire... that would ascend the brightest sky of invention. A kingdom for a stage. A princess to act... and monarchs to behold this welling scene. Slut! Well, look what the cat dragged in. What are you auditioning for? "Straight Shooters", new cop show on Fox! I didn't get to go on that. Yeah, well, I don't think you're right for it. What part is it? Jamie, ex-playmate, now cop. Jamie joined the APD because her daddy was killed in the line of duty! Jamie's extreme beauty betrays her will power and feline ambition! Men on the force soon realize she is a force to be reckoned with... after she out shoots them all in a downtown bank robbery. Right? Where's your gun? Fuck, I don't have a gun! Shit, I need a gun. Good luck. I wanna hear all about last night. Help yourself to a donut. I was getting in character. Ellie, I need you to take out the garbage, like, even once. Girl, no. It's serious, I'm not lying. He is gay. I know. I know it's so crazy. Hang on. - Can you just tell Dennis I'm here? - Yeah, what's your name? - Ellie Parker. - Hold on. Virtual Management. Forget it. Wait! Excuse me. Excuse me! Miss? Excuse me, miss, you cannot just walk back here! My name is not "miss". Ellie Parker, and you should know that by now. Say it. Say my name. - Say it. - Ellie Parker. - Hi. - Why don't we calm down? Come into my office. Sit, sit. What is going on with you, I mean... Bursting in here like a big drama queen. If you were only that good in your auditions. I quit. I quit. I can't do this anymore, Dennis. No, I honestly cannot remember... the reasons I wanted to become an actress in the first place. I used to dream about being an artist... and enlightening the human condition, and now this is... It's all a... It's a big... You know? Ellie, everyone on the team here... is trying their best to keep you working. I don't think there's any disagreement... of what an extraordinary actress you are. People wanna hire confidence. You know, when you walk in that room... they don't wanna know about vulnerability or desperation. You know, it just makes them uncomfortable, that's all. Did someone say something? No, I just think it's good karma for us to talk honestly. I think your spirit's been broken a little bit, and they sense that. It only reminds them of their own weaknesses. Yeah, well, I don't give a shit anymore. I don't. What about that "Cruel City"? Did I get a callback on that? Oh, they wanted a name. Who? - Eslie Bibb. - Who the fuck is eslie Bibb? Who is that? - You're being hostile. - I'm bitter too! You said I'm a good actress. What is so wrong with me? - What makes me unhirable? - You're brilliant! You know what? I want all my head shots... my compilation tapes, anything else you might have of mine. Pack it up. I'm done, Dennis. I'm through! Ellie, I really think you ought to think about this, I mean... one doesn't make such a big decision because they had a bad day. I thought about it a lot, actually. And it is the hardest decision I ever had to make. Apart from have or not have an abortion. Rainbow, I want you to get a box... and collect all of Ellie Parker's head shots and all of her videotapes. Put them in the box, bring in the box, hold my calls. Bye. That's it? You're not even going to try to talk me out of it? Come on, Dennis, you can try, you know? I... I cannot interfere in other people's destiny. I can't. Are you okay? Vanessa left me. Oh, my God, Dennis! Sorry. What happened? Well, she caught me fucking around on her. Oh, my God! I don't mean to laugh, I... I hope you're okay. Thank you. For trying. You look good. - Really? - Yeah. Suspiciously good. Have you had some work done? - You have, haven't you? - A tiny, tiny bit. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dennis! Et me see! I'm only telling you this 'cause you're not my client anymore! Good work. Good luck in whatever you decide to do, Ellie Parker. Bye, Ellie. Yes, this is your baby, Sebastian. You know how I know it's yours? Because it's a cancer! It's a like a tumor growing inside of me! I want it out of me! No, you look at me! You look at me now! Do you understand? Please, get away! "The Tides of Passion" will return after these messages. I know this is out of the blue, but I just have been thinking about you. I just feel it's too long since we've spoken. There's some changes going on and... Anyway, I'm just trying to connect. Pick up! I've been really busy and... not been able to catch up with any friends and now it's the time. I owe you so many phone calls and I know... you're wondering why I'm calling, but I really wanna speak to you. I want to tell you everything that's going on and... see how you're doing... see if you're all right. I know some great things have been happening to you, and I just... I broke up with Justin and... Anyway, please, can you call me? I really would like to speak to you. I'm really, really sorry I haven't called. I don't know. Can you call me, please, Sally? Hi, Sally, it's me again. I'm so sorry. You must think I'm a total freak. I don't know what came over me! But I'm really fine. It would be good to see you. I hope all is going well. I just wanna, you know, meet the baby... and see how things are going. Wow, he must be getting big now, uke. Uke or was it uce? Uce... I don't know if it was an old message or something, but anyway... I'm returning your call. Fuck! Hi, it's Ellie. How are you? Ook, I was wondering what are you doing. Do you... Do you have any time lately, 'cause I'm free and... and if you wanted to come over. I... I... Yeah, sure, now? Now now? Hold on. - Hi, how are you? - Good, how are you? - Good to see you. - Good to see you too. Double kiss. Hey, I'm sorry about the other night. No, no, it's fine. It's totally fine. - Come in. Hey, cool bag. - Thanks. Yeah, it's from Guatemala. I got it when I visited Central America. Really? That's interesting. I'd love to go there. It's great, really incredible. You'd love to go there. - Okay, come in. - Okay. It's hard to explain, but I kind of feel... I sort of feel like this huge sense of relief, you know? I feel... liberated. But then, on the other hand, I also feel... sad, you know? Kind of like someone died. I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to be alone and... - I don't know how to be alone either. - Really? Yeah, I mean... Do you have a thing like voices in your head? - You mean like...? - Not like "kill, kill, kill", like... Yeah, right. But yeah, that's why I do what I do, that's why I love to act. It's a creative outlet, it's putting it somewhere, you know? You wanna hear something really weird? My therapist has a crush on me. That's kind of what's supposed to happen a little bit, it's called... Transference, I know. But this is not that. This is seriously awkward. I don't know, it's... I feel like she's undressing me right there, on the couch. Every time I'm about to leave I walk away thinking I'm gonna feel good... then she says something negative, as if to say "Come back, love me. - Need me, need me, need me. " - That's what's supposed to happen. You kind of... It's a kind of controlled mini nervous breakdown. I know. Do you wanna know something? I'll let you in on something. Therapist, the rapist. - What do you mean? - It means the same thing. Spell out "therapist", break it up to 2 words: "the rapist". That's what it means, that's what she's doing... That was weird. Well, I'm definitely gay. What? I wasn't totally sure until now. I've done stuff with guys and women but I didn't really know. Thanks a lot for crystallizing it. I appreciate it. Are you fucking kidding me? Wait, I don't... Sorry. I don't have anything. We used a condom, it's... That's not the point. Oh, my God. Idiot! Oh, my God! - I can't believe you! - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You have to go, okay? I can't take this. I didn't mean to do anything fucked up like that. I'm really sorry. I don't believe this. This is not happening. How did you...? - I was thinking about Johnny Depp. - Oh, my God. I'm embarrassed. I didn't know that... I didn't know. I can't believe it. I'm an experiment all of a sudden, right? Are you 15 years-old? You should've figured this out a long time ago! Who are you? You gotta go, okay? Just get your fucking clothes and get out of here. Take your shoes and don't forget your little purse! - It's not a purse, it's a bag. - It's a purse! I've seen the same one in Urban Outfitters in the women's section. That's the closest you'll ever going to get to Guatemala. Go! Oh, God! - I'm going, I'm sorry. - I feel violated! You have two new messages. First new message. Hey, Ellie, it's me, Justin. Hi. I haven't been able to take a dump since you've been gone. Roses are red Violets are too I miss you so much My balls are blue Message erased. Sent today at 12:37. Ellie, this is Dennis. Don't hang up. You got a callback for "Delta Breeze". I'd love to drag you out of your retirement. It'd be great to do. So give me a ring and we'll set that up, okay? Take care. Bye-bye. Message saved. Sitting on that front porch, I stared at your eyes for hours. That terrible night, the storm ripped and... Yeah, momma. Fuck. Nice dress. Ellie, hi. I'm so glad that you're here. You look great. - You don't think it's too much? - No, it's perfect. Et me tell you: It's intense in there. It's been a sort of a nightmarish movie so far. I just wanted you to know before you go in so you can be prepared. - But you look beautiful. - Thank you. Really, really. Everyone, this is Ellie Parker. Smash, you remember Ellie? So nice to see you again. These are the new producers. What happened to the other producers? We are paying for this movie now. We fired those plastic Hollywood idiots. Fucking idiots. Plastic. - We are making a real movie. - Oh, cool. Art. Not shit art. There's too much light in here. Do you have the new scene? New scene? Fucking cunt. Is that a wedding dress? Are you getting married? Marriage is for beasts! - Ook, what new scene? I didn't... - Very simple, a few lines. They encapsulate the entire meaning of love. Sorry to spring this on you, Ellie. If you wanna take a minute... We just wanna see your mouth move. Eugene's gonna be reading this with you. Eugene. Have a seat, right? Where's the lines? Who has a light? Far be it from me to air my... Stop, stop. - There. - Very nice. Very nice. Much better. Far be it from me to air my opinion, Mr. O'Malley... but I believe in a single God... and a single nation. Not two Americas. This is worth fighting for! You're a lady of mighty fine opinions and a beautiful woman too. Why, Mr. O'Malley... it's getting kind of late to be out without a chaperone. I can see the butterflies! So pretty. We should head back. Although I love the swamp at dusk. I miss my husband. Well, then allow me to comfort you. Oh, Mr. O'Malley. - That was great. Totally great. - Great. That was perfect, Ellie. Do you know the meaning of love? Ove is shit. Do you guys want her to do this again? One more time? Do you guys want her to do this again? Should we do another... Come on, Ellie. That was great. Have fun in Los Angeles. I am so sorry. That was really, really good. They're really weird and kind of intense. - Whatever. - Can I talk to you for a second? - I need to have some words with you. - I wanna apologize. I'll be right in. - Goodbye, Nellie. - Ellie. Goodbye. I wanna take you to dinner and talk about Justin. I am so sorry, Ellie. I'm sorry. Fuck!
