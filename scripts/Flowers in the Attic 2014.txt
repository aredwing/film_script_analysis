After all, it started out that way. We were four beautiful children With blond hair and porcelain skin. We looked like those fancy dresden dolls That grace shelves and mantels. Only we weren't just admired. We were really loved. But that was before. "life is full of surprises," my mother used to say. And greed and fear and shame, as I soon learned. And hopelessness. We never colored even one of our paper flowers Yellow. FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC Give them back, Christopher. Not until you quit pounding on my wall, you freak. Hey. What do you kids think you're doing? I don't even get a hug? Dad! Daddy! Oh! I missed you all so much! What did you bring us? For you, son. Thank you. Did you forget about me? Mm! I could never forget about you. It's so beautiful. Oh! I got you! Oh! I wish you never had to go away For work again. Promise me you won't. I hate to break up the party, But dinner's almost ready, and I made your favorite-- Homemade apple pie. Corrine, you shouldn't have. She didn't. You forgot to take off the bakery label. Ugh. Cathy! Could never get anything past you, huh? Yeah, mom. What's going on? I mean, you're wearing a new dress and perfume. Well, the wife of a vice-president Can't wear just any old thing. I was gonna wait until it was 100% official, But I got promoted, And I'm now the head of sales of the entire east coast. That's great! Thank you. He got promoted! He's so smart, that's why. Nobody's here. Cathy... Hey. This is a big opportunity for me. For all of us. I know what's gonna happen. You'll be away all the time. Mom will be busy with the twins. Christopher will act like he's the man of the house. I'll be totally forgotten. Can I tell you a secret? I bought this... On my last trip, And it's more money than I should've spent, But the moment I saw it, I knew you had to have it. So, when I'm traveling, I need you to be strong. Can you do that for me? Mommy! Cathy's hurting me! It wouldn't hurt so much If you'd sit still for five seconds. Girls, please. Your dad's gonna be home in less than two hours, I need to ice the cake, chill the champagne-- Where are your brothers? Why do I have to wear a tie? 'Cause we're the "dresden dolls." I don't wanna be a doll. It's just a saying, darling. Because the neighbors think we look so perfect. We are perfect. Why isn't he here yet? He's probably just stuck in traffic. When are we gonna eat the cake? I want it now! Can I take off my tie, please? Just be patient, darlings, okay? I'm going to go freshen the ice. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I hear someone in the driveway. Mrs. Dollanganger? I'm sorry, but, um... There's been an accident. Mama? Mom? Alright, guys, five more minutes. Is daddy coming home tonight? No. Remember? We told you. He died. Sometimes, when I really miss him, I just pretend he's on a business trip And that he'll be back any day. You guys wash up for dinner. Mom, um, the twins want you to read them a story. Is that the mail? Madame pomfrey says I can't stay in ballet class, Unless we pay for last month. Are we gonna be okay without dad? I'm doing the best I can. It's not easy for a woman to get a job And to support four kids on her own. Look at me, I'm an ornament. The only thing I was ever good at Was being pretty. You know... You're lucky. You had a dad that thought you were special. Because I'm just like you. Well, in looks, maybe, But you're more aggressive and determined. You're just like his mother, And he loved his mother. Doesn't everyone love their mother? Some mothers are impossible to love. They don't act like mothers at all. Have christopher read the twins a story, And put this in the mailbox for tomorrow. Another one? But you already sent-- It's late. You should finish your homework. Cathy, christopher! Come inside, now. You know all those letters I sent? Well, I finally got a response. It's all working out as I'd hoped. We can go live with your grandmother, In virginia. What grandmother? You and dad said That we never had any family. Well... It's complicated. My parents and I, we didn't see eye-to-eye, So we thought it was best to keep our distance, But with your father gone, This is our best hope for now. What about school? And all of our friends? My ballet classes? You two are old enough to understand, To help your mother out of a desperate situation. But we still have the house, And I can get a part-time job, Cathy can help out more with the twins. People have a way of believing That nothing bad can ever happen. And your father was doing so well At his job, so... We charged against our future. What do you mean? Nothing here is really ours. Not the furniture, the cars, your toys... N-not even this necklace. It's been four months, And I've been holding them at bay, But the bank is gonna come and take it all away. Look, I know it sounds scary, But I've saved the best news for last. My family is rich. Not middle-class rich, but unbelievably wealthy, And they have one of the finest homes in all of virginia, With servants, And acres of land, and their very own lake. Wait till we tell everyone at school. We leave tonight. Tonight? It's our only choice. I know it's hard, But I promise you, Whatever you leave behind, I'll buy you a thousand more in virginia. You won't miss a thing. Don't worry, mom. We're dollangangers. We'll be happy wherever. I knew I could count on you, christopher. And one more thing... Our name isn't really dollanganger. It's foxworth. I bet the house is huge. I mean, you could have your own dance studio With costumes and a grand piano. I wouldn't even hear you. You'll be out exploring the woods and the lake. Way better than any boring biology class. Ma'am? We'll reach your depot in a few minutes. Thank you. You're sure you wouldn't rather Get off in charlottesville? It's 3:00 a.M., In the middle of nowhere. Oh, thank you. We have someone meeting us. Just the children's bag. Someone will pick up mine tomorrow. Thank you. Have a good night. Godspeed, Mrs. Patterson. I thought you said There was someone meeting us. We should be there before the sun breaks. It's a long walk. How long? I can't carry the twins. Well, let them walk. The country air will do them good. Where are we going? I wanna go back home now! Just a little further, and everything will be alright. You really think so? Yes. If that's what mom said. This is foxworth hall. Okay, cory, blow your nose, okay? Okay. Good. Good. Okay, cathy, button this button. Hello, mother. Well... Look what the cat dragged in. Shh. Shh. Thank you for taking us in, mother. I don't know what we would've done. I'm not your father, corrine. Your groveling has always bored me. I see your children have inherited your good looks. I just hope there's no hidden defect or affliction. I didn't agree to run a circus here. My children are perfect, physically and mentally. They just need some rest. Well, the two older children can't share a bed. Cathy and christopher are children. They're innocent. Yes. That's what I used to presume about you. Well, if you're so worried, Why don't you put them in a separate room? Heaven knows there's enough here. No, this is the only safe room Where your father can't hear them. Put the two girls in one bed And the two boys in the other one. And when your mother and I leave here, I will lock this room from the outside, And you will keep the drapes closed. And remember... God sees everything. God sees what evil you do behind my back. I'll wait for you out in the hall. Grandfather doesn't know we're here? I'm sorry, I should've told you the truth, But I didn't want you to be frightened. When I was 18, I did something my parents didn't approve of, So my father wrote me out of his will. Is that why she hates us? She doesn't hate you. She's just jealous Of how much I love you guys and your dad, How much my father used to love me. That's why we're here. I'm gonna win him back. He's gonna put us in his will. He's 78 years old and he's dying, And I just need a little time alone to reconnect with him. How much time? I don't know exactly. Maybe a few days or a week? And when I win my father over, I'm gonna take you all down to meet him, And I know he'll love each and every one of you Just as much as I do. We'll be fine up here. We're foxworths. And tomorrow, I'll bring toys and games, And I'll come visit you as much as I can. And just whatever you do, Don't make your grandmother angry, okay? Corrine! What is that on that child's hand? It's a promise ring, from my father. Give it to me. Mom, she can't. Dad gave it to me. I said, give it to me, girl! Or must I speak more... Slowly? And don't you ever mention your father in this house again. Come on, Corrine, that's enough. I'm sorry. I promise, all our dreams are gonna come true. Just trust me. Where's the sun? Is it still night? Cory! Don't. Your food. Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Get your hands off that. That food has to last you the entire day. I can't be running up and down the stairs. The servants might get suspicious. There'll be eggs for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch, And chicken for dinner, And I want you to eat all of it. Don't waste one bite of it, you understand? And if you're very good, I may bring you some fruit. Thank you. I've written out a list of other rules. First of all, you'll keep this room neat and tidy, As if nobody lived here. Keep your hair brushed neatly, And your bodies clean and fully clothed. And be modest when you go to the bathroom. Girls and boys are never to use the bathroom at the same time. You older children will keep the younger ones quiet. No running around or yelling or crying, They're good kids, But they need somewhere to play and make noise. Ah. Over here, there's a... Stairway. Leads up to the attic. You want us to play in an attic? Up there, there will be ample room. And, the last Friday of every month, You're to clean out all of your things And hide up there While the maids are cleaning this room. No one must ever see or hear you. Do you understand? Good. Because if your grandfather ever discovered that you're here, You'd all be thrown out without a red cent, But not before getting punished for even being alive. Carrie... You can dress up for days in here. Hey, Cor', check it out. You finally get your own record player. But it doesn't have a plug. You just have to crank it. Better hope you inherit from this half of the gene pool. Like you know anything. Our entire family. They're all grumpy! Like our grandma. They're not grumpy. Guys! You gotta come check this out. Looks we weren't the first kids up here. It's hot and dusty. I don't like it. It's not so bad. I wanna go outside in the garden. This is a bad place. I want mama! Okay, we're gonna make this a game. Pretend we're outside. The floor can be the garden, And the ceiling can be the sky, And I'll even make a swing. What do you think she meant, Grandfather punishing us for even being alive? She's just trying to scare us. Then how come she said we'd be here for months? Quit worrying. Mom's gonna take care of us. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. See? It worked. Cory, carrie, come try this out. I'm telling you, the week's gonna fly by. Mom's gonna win over her dad and we'll all be rich. We'll never have to see this attic again. This is cold and greasy! I don't like it. Cripes, carrie. This is all we have. No! I don't like this either. Children, enough. Wasting food... Is the devil's work. If you leave so much as one bite of your food... God will tell me-- ...And you will be punished And sent to the bowels of hell! Mommy! Oh, mom. Sorry. We were just goofing around. He was trying to get the twins to eat. Oh, kids, what did I tell you? I just, um... Oh, mother. Um... Don't be mad. It's not their fault. They didn't properly understand. They will. Mom? You okay? I just wanted to come say goodnight. How was your first day? It wasn't so bad, was it? Mommy, we don't like it here. It's not nice. Carrie, stop. No. Cathy and christopher are mean. We wanna go home. With you, mama. We want you. I'm sorry, darlings, It's just, for now, You have to listen to your older brother and sister, Like they're parents. No! Take us out of here. Now! Corrine! Stop that child from screaming right now. Ow! Get away from me! Get! Get off! Stop yelling! They're only five. Take off your blouse and show them How bad behavior is dealt with in this house. You can do whatever you want to me, But you can't be cruel to my children, Or we'll leave tonight, And you'll never see them, or me, ever again. Go! Now take off your blouse. Do it! Take a good long look, children, At what happens when you disobey me. 18 lashes, For every year she used her wicked charms On my husband! And 20 more For every year she lived in sin with your father. A marriage that was an abomination In the eyes of the lord, With four children Spawned by the devil! Evil... From the moment you were conceived. Evil! I make the rules in this house. I do! And I execute the punishment. [door creaks] Figured since I couldn't get you a real garden, That you could build a garden in the attic. What about grandmother? Won't she punish us? She's claustrophobic. She'll never climb the stairs. You should take it easy. Mom. It's okay. It's just a willow switching. My pride hurts worse than my back. But why? Why did grandmother say those things about daddy? About us? When I was little, I turned to my father for love. We did everything together. Sailing and horseback-riding, Even hunting. That only made my mother more jealous. And she took every opportunity she could To torment me and shame me, And she succeeded. Over the years, My father became more and more busy with work, And I became More withdrawn and lonely. And into all this came my father's half-brother. His mother had recently died and my family took him in. He was only a few years older than me. He was so handsome and so kind, and, uh... So full of life. My father treated him like he was his own son, And I'd never met anyone like him. You're talking about dad? We tried to keep our feelings secret, Even from each other. I mean, we were related by blood. He was my half-uncle. And when we eloped, My family flew into a rage and my father disinherited me, And my mother said That my children would be born with hooved feet And forked tails. She was wrong. God didn't punish me, not with you. You are perfect. You have to believe it, no matter what anyone says. I hope you can understand That love doesn't always come when you want it. Sometimes it just happens, against your will. I don't care what you did, mom, or do. I'll always love you. Why did grandmother let you come back? Because she's been waiting 20 years To say "I told you so." Trust me, cathy, I'm as much a captive of this place as you are. Hey, Cor'. That's a great... It's a snail. I can't wait to show it to mama when she comes. If she comes. She's only missed a few days. A week. I've made a calendar. You gonna help out with the garden or what? We need water. Watch where you're going! Why are you in such a hurry? Sorry, I-I just had to get some more water For christopher before the paint dries. The paint? We're building a garden, In the attic, So the twins won't be so scared. Was this your mother's idea? Hope you didn't inherit her artistic abilities. The only real talent corrine ever had was... For the opposite sex. I'm a dancer, actually. Ballet. And christopher's a really good artist. He can paint anything. Has he ever painted you? Has he asked you to pose for him With your clothes off? Come on, girl! Spill out the truth! I want to know what kind of wickedness you're up to! Nothing. Nothing? Why are you trembling? Because you keep accusing us of doing all these bad things, And I don't even know what you're talking about. You don't know what I'm talking about. Ask your brother! He'll know. By the time they're born, The male of the species They know all about wickedness... Evil. Right. Now, make sure that you take all of your toys. Check under the beds. Make sure. I don't want any trace of you here. Why don't you take this? Why does this table look polished? The room can't look like it's just been dusted! The maids are gonna be here in less than an hour. Alright, never mind. I'll take care of it. Uh-- Here are some real flowers for your fake garden. Just go. "See Jane run. Run, Jane, run." Now you try. No! We've already read it a kazillion times. If you guys play nicely tonight, We can go on the roof tomorrow morning. I don't wanna go on the roof. Mom! We missed you so much! I'm sorry I've kept you waiting so long, darlings, But here's some games, And the paints you asked for, cathy. Where have you been? I wanted to come earlier, but... I've had to spend every moment with my father. You have no idea how hard it's been on me. Today, I finally Just had a chance to go sailing on the lake. You went sailing? You got some great color, mom. Can you stay for the twins' bedtime? Yeah! Stay! Stay! I have a movie date with an old friend. She keeps asking me out But I would much rather be with you guys! Then why aren't you downstairs telling your father about us? Well, cathy, I have to time it very carefully. I only just got back. It's been a month! And I'm sick of being in here. The twins need fresh air and sunshine. I want to go sailing! Stop picking on mom, Cathy. I just want to know when. When are you going to tell your father about us? When do we get to leave? Like I said, My father has just finally accepted me back. Then why can't he accept us? Are we so terrible, or stupid, or ugly, That he wouldn't want to meet his own grandchildren? I can't. I can't tell him about you, ever. My father forgave me on one condition-- That I didn't have any children with your father. You know what? I'll cancel my movie date, And I'll stay here with you and the twins. It's okay, mom. You go. We'll be fine here. He could go any day now. That's how heart disease works. A blood clot could break free And find its way to his lungs or heart, Snuff him out like a candle. With our luck, grandfather will never die. We'll be stuck up here forever. What's few more weeks? A month, even? Pretty soon, We're gonna be worth millions. Mom already acts like she is. Have you noticed How she's always in a new outfit? She's a foxworth. She has to fit in around here. Cory's a cheater! I thought you guys were playing hide-and-seek. We were! But I called and called and he won't come out. Cory! Where are you? Christopher. Over here. It's gonna be okay. We just need to get him warmed up. Cathy? I miss mama so much. Pretend I'm your mom. I love you so much. That's what makes a real mother. Our first christmas without dad. Remember how he used to take us sledding Behind the flanagans'? He was always running alongside us, Making sure the twins were safe. One christmas up here won't matter. And we can make our own presents for the twins. Say it's from santa. We could make something for grandmother, too. She does bring us food every day. She got us that plant. She might even let us out. Hurry, cathy! She's gonna be here. Careful. I don't want it to rip. Christopher, can I have the card? It has to be perfect. Grandmother? Cathy! Cathy! Wake up. Santa came! This gift is not from santa. It's for cory and carrie to play pretend house, Just like I did. And all the doors and windows really work And the locks. I knew that color would look perfect on you. You look just like your father when I first met him. You think so? I got this sent from paris. It's hand-embroidered. Don't you like it? Yes. I just don't know where I'd wear it. Well, I know it's not a perfect christmas, But I still have one more trick up my sleeve. A window to the outside world. My father gave it to me. But that's not all. Bart, Mr. Winslow, he says that my father Has an even bigger surprise for me. Who's Mr. Winslow? He's my father's attorney. He says it's only a matter Of drawing up the new paperwork, but... I'm gonna inherit everything. I knew you could do it, mom. He's throwing me a party tonight, With champagne and a live orchestra And anyone who's anyone-- -...In virginia. -Can we come? Please? We'll hide somewhere and we'll be quiet, And no one will hear us or see us, I swear. I think it's too risky. I mean, after putting in all this time... We haven't seen other people in so long. It's the only thing I really want. Don't you care if I'm happy? Cathy, quit it. You think she's happy Knowing her kids are locked up in an attic? It's okay, Christopher. You can come. You can both come. After the twins are asleep. I feel like, for the first time since your father died, Things are finally looking up for us. This is where I used to hide and watch my parents' parties. Just remember your promise, okay? Be quiet as mice. And after dinner, Go straight back to our room. Yes. The house hasn't been so lively in years. And all this because of you. That's what worries me. I hope I don't disappoint anyone. Oh, no, miss foxworth, you're as lovely as ever. Thank you, sarah. That dress... Most women would be too modest to wear it. I know you don't approve of this party, But try to have fun, For father's sake. Your father's well-being is my only concern. It's the one thing we share. Merry christmas. Corrine, this is all too gorgeous. I wanted something simpler, But my father insisted. Well, I always told him, "spare the rod, And spoil the child." Mother, please. Well, she certainly doesn't look spoiled. God, I can't even imagine Being invited to a party like this. You won't have to. Someday, it's gonna be our party. John, I told sarah specifically To serve the aged bourbon. I always keep A few extra bottles handy up here. I know how Mr. Foxworth enjoys it. Oh, never mind. It'll just make him fall asleep before dinner. And john... Get rid of sarah. Tonight? But, ma'am, it's dead cold out, And there are no more trains. Well, then that will show the servants What happens when they don't do as I say. Father! Merry christmas. It's so beautiful. I don't deserve that. It belonged to my mother. Passed on from her own mother. And this... Is just the beginning. It's so beautiful. Ah. Maybe someday you'll have a daughter of your own That you can pass it on to. Come on, over here. You're missing all the fun, mr. Winslow. Come on, corrine. Just five minutes alone. You know I hate big parties. I can't, bart. Everyone's waiting for me. You must have a secret. What? You're beautiful, smart... Pretty soon, you'll be one of The richest women in Virginia. That's the least of your charm. How are you so perfect? Well, I'm far from perfect. Just ask my mother. Ah, what does your mother know? I have to go back and be the dutiful daughter, remember? I can't wait to start our lives together... Just the two of us. Did you hear that? He said "just the two of us"? Well, she's about to inherit millions. A lot of guys are gonna be after her. We should go back up to the room. You coming? No. No, not yet. I'm gonna explore the house. We can't do that, not tonight. I just want to see this famous "swan bed" Everybody's talking about. Nobody's talking about my bed. Where's Christopher? Where is Christopher? I don't know. He went to look around. Do you know what would happen If anyone found out about you? Just when everything is coming together for me? Mom, we were quiet. No one heard us, I swear. Just for that, you will never come out of this room. Not for any reason! How can you say that? You can't keep us locked in here forever. If you ever do that again, I will whip you! And cathy, too! Morning. What's the matter? Should I tell santa to take back all your presents? Go play. I'm sorry about last night. I didn't mean it, about the whippings. Any of it. I just-- I was scared that you would get caught And we would lose everything. I would never do anything to hurt you. You have to believe me. What about bart winslow? We saw you together. Are you with him? Well, I-I told you, he's my father's attorney, And he's helping us. You should be glad that we've become so close. This is all a mistake. What? Coming here. Look what it's done to you. To me. Let's leave, right now. Start over somewhere else, without my father's money. No amount of money is worth Having my own children not love me. Just know that, if we leave, We can never come back. Of course, I love you, mom. ...A rugged design. A sturdy, lightweight steel frame... ...On all four wheels. And hydraulic brakes. It has a fully automatic transmission, And it's equipped with aluminum-frame... Hey. What are you doing up here? Sorry. I just... I just realized we've been here an entire year. What is that? It's nothing. Why do you want to look at that? At those women? Just drop it. When men and women love each other, They have feelings In their hearts as well as their bodies. See, at your age, it's natural That your body would start changing. I don't want my body to change. Well, you don't have any choice. It's nature's way of making you into a woman. You don't want to be a child your whole life, do you? What about Christopher? Well, he'll have to start shaving, And there's other things that he'll have to learn. Like what? Kissing? You know, I'll explain it all to you one day. But in the meantime, I brought you all some new clothes. And I brought this specially for you. You know, you're lucky. At your age, I had no one to come to with these questions. What're you doing? You look so, uh... Ah. I knew I'd catch you sooner or later. We weren't doing anything. You think you look so pretty In your new young curves And your long, golden hair. How many times have you allowed your brother To use you? Use? What do you mean? I walked in on cathy by accident. We haven't done anything wrong. Your sister is almost naked. And she allowed you to look upon her body! Sit down, girl. What're you doing? I am going to cut off your precious hair Down to the scalp. Maybe then you won't feel so much pride When you look in the mirror. You're not gonna cut one strand of cathy's hair. Oh? Alright, then. Have it your way. Her hair... Or the four of you don't eat for a week. But the twins... They didn't do anything. I think it'll be your brother Who will cut off your precious hair. Or none of you will eat at all. I'm still hungry. Me too. I want a sandwich now. We just need to ration what we have. Until mom comes back. You guys can have my crackers. How could she do this to us? I don't know. No! We're innocent. She can't control us. We can't let her. The twins don't look good. I can check the mouse traps in the attic. I think it's tar. It's not coming out. I tried everything From the chemistry kit mom gave me. You'll have to use the scissors. It wasn't your fault. All you did was look at me. I try so hard not to think about girls. I just wish to god you weren't so... Close. Then you do think of me? You think I'm pretty? Yeah. Uh... You're pretty, but... Brothers don't think of their sisters that way. No way. I need a dance partner to do this next move. I said I don't dance. Gimme that. You jerk! This is my favorite one. It's not my fault you outgrew it. You're outgrowing a lot of things. When are we gonna outgrow things? No! I don't want to go outside! You guys need fresh air and sunshine. It's for your own good. No! Let them go, chris. They're never gonna grow. Not in this attic. Cathy... We're getting out of here. Cathy, come on! Where do you think mom is? I don't know. It's been over a month. She's never been gone that long. Why didn't she tell us where she was going? Wherever she is, I'm sure she's thinking of us. Do you still trust her? I don't even know what I feel anymore. I mean, I want to trust her, I do, but... If something happened to her... What would happen to us? She's so beautiful. Cathy, careful. We should get back, Before the twins wake up. He's trapped! Do something! Don't let him die! I want him to be my pet. Cory, just don't touch him. You're mean! You won't let Cory have anything. I'm gonna call him Mickey. Careful, be gentle. Don't worry. I'm gonna take good care of you. I promise. Sweeties! I'm sorry I was gone so long, But I have wonderful news! Is it grandfather? Is he dead? Oh, cathy, don't be so morbid. Do you remember I told you about my father's attorney? Bart winslow. Well, we've grown closer over the past year, And we got married. What? When did this happen? A few months ago. That's why I was gone so long. We just got back from our honeymoon in europe. Well, I thought about you the whole time. I even got you these beautiful presents. This is a boat and it's called a gondola. You were wrong to go away. To stay away for so long. I don't care why. Try to be happy for me. I loved your father, but he's gone. I need someone to love, And someone to love me. When you're older, you'll understand. We are older, mom! Look at us. I'm not a kid anymore! And cathy, does she even look like a little girl? I know you're gonna love bart. I got you this magnifying glass. It's an antique. You said we would be up here for one night, Then a few days, a month-- It's been more than two years, mom! You think your presents are gonna make up For what we've lost? What we're losing? You have no right to talk to me like that. You agreed to stay here until my father died. I said that I would Take care of you, and I have. You have food and books and toys, And a tv set! If you can't have pity for us, think of the twins. Mom... They don't even know who you are anymore. I'm their mother. I'm the only person who truly loves them. All along, I've only done the best I could. You haven't even Told bart about us. Have you? He doesn't even know we exist. I never could get anything past you, could I, cathy? Are these donuts? They're from your mother. I wouldn't eat 'em, if I were you. They're not good for your health. We could escape, you know. We could go down the roof again. With the twins. I know they were scared before, But if we just explained it... And we can time it out with the train. Don't you think I know that? Then why are we still here? All the money in the world Is not worth this. You still believe mom? What choice do I have? Besides... Where the hell are we supposed to go from here? Step away from the window, boy. My name's not "boy." It's Christopher. What did you say? I said my name is Christopher. The same as my father's. Take off your shirt, boy. I will whip your sister and both the twins If you don't take off your shirt. Now! Cathy, go to the attic. -Don't touch him! -Go! Cathy... Now. Take off your shirt. I was so scared. I kept thinking, If something happened to you... Don't worry, Cath'. I'm right here. I'm right here. I know what we did was wrong, But I don't care. Felt good, didn't it? And romantic? What is the meaning of this? Nothing. You were right about us all along. We are the devil's spawn. "when someone wants to do wrong, "it's never god who's tempting him... "for god never wants to do wrong "and never tempts anyone else to do it. "temptation is the pull Of man's own evil thoughts and wishes." Can you ever forgive us? Only the lord can forgive you, boy. Prayer is the key to your salvation. No. This is our key. This is the master key. It should work on all the doors, Even the front one. I wish we could run away tonight. Well, we need money. Lots of it. So when we escape, We can go wherever we want. We can steal... From the house. If grandmother catches us, she'll whip us. She probably keeps track of every single penny. But not mom. Dad always said She was careless with money. Cathy, you find anything? You didn't tell me there was all this stuff. Last time I was here, there wasn't this much stuff. How do I look? You look ridiculous. Now, uh... Take that stuff off and start looking for cash. We can't take too much or she might notice. Cathy, what's the matter? Are you deaf? $30. That'll barely get us to the next county. We need a thousand. A-at least. That'll take weeks. We need to leave now. No, not till we have enough to get away from here. Cory? Didn't I give you my extra donut If you'd sit still? It's mickey. He doesn't like the hammering noises. What are they doing? They're putting up a fence. Alright, you go in without me. I need to check outside. No. What if something happens to you? I have to make sure we can get out. I love you, christopher doll. I love you, too. Bart, you're just careless. You can't find your own wallet. It's not me, it's the maids. I swear I left it in my black trousers. And I think they've been stealing from us. The other day, I was missing $5. Before that, it was 10. $5, $10-- what's the difference? You left me alone at our own dinner party? It's not exactly a party, Having to sit across from your mother. I'm sorry. You know I want to move out of here, too, As soon as possible. Let's take a trip. Babe, I can't. You know how busy work is right now. What about a mini-vacation? I know a certain swan bed that has a vacancy. As a matter of fact, I had the sweetest dream earlier there today. Really? Yeah. A beautiful young blonde girl Snuck into the room, kissed me. Right on the lips. She reminded me of you, But younger, more innocent. Wow. That must've been a dream. Why don't we go stay in a hotel? That way, you don't have to see my mother's face in the morning. How could you be so careless? I'm sorry. He was asleep. I was curious. You kissed that man! And he wasn't asleep, he saw you! Mom can't know we passed through a locked door! We don't have enough money yet. You think you're the only one frustrated? Christopher! Stop! You're hurting me. It's okay. You didn't mean it. We'll go to Florida. Sarasota... Where all the circus people live. Yeah. We can star in a freak show. We can pretend this never happened. We can make sure that it never happens again. The thing is... I want to feel this way about you. I love you. I don't know if I can ever love anyone else. Cory doesn't feel so good. He's been vomiting for hours. I think it might be food poisoning. He needs to go to the hospital. Why are you just standing there? Don't you care what happens to him? Have you forgotten that you're his mother? You. It's always you. Cathy, stop! You think you can do anything you want And people will believe you. They'll learn the truth someday. When your husband learns You have four children locked away in an attic, See how "perfect" he thinks you really are. And your father, too. You won't inherit one damned penny, And I'll be glad! The girl is right, Corrine. That child should go to the hospital. I drove cory to the hospital. How is he? Cory had pneumonia. The doctors did all they could, but... It was too late. Will there be a funeral? He's already been buried. I'm sorry. Carrie? Cathy. Just let her be. We need to run away. Or else we're all gonna die like cory. Do we have enough money? We'll go tonight. Take everything we can. Money, jewelry. Everything. She's not coming back. Is she? She's dead to us now. When do we tell her? After breakfast. I don't want her getting scared. More than she has to be. So we just walk right out the front door? We wait till dinner, When all the servants and family Are in the kitchen or dining room. So carrie and I will go to the fence And you'll go to the shed So you can turn off the electricity? Then we catch up by the lake And head to the depot for the evening train. And by the time grandmother comes in With our breakfast tomorrow, We'll be halfway to Florida. I was thinking, I can sell my ring. It's okay. It's what dad would've wanted. You're keeping that ring. Forever. I'm telling you, I did hear someone. Must be those mice. They make an awful racket. You can hear them all the way up in the attic. Mrs. Foxworth carries enough poison up there To kill a german army of 'em. Do you think miss corrine will sell the place? I doubt she'll be making any hasty decisions. Hasty? It's been seven months Since Mr. Foxworth died. Well, never mind that. All you maids will be losing your job soon enough If you don't mind the silver. Carrie, you gotta eat something. You have to be strong, for later. No. Don't feel well. I have to take care of mickey. Where'd you get that? I saved it for cory, For when he came back from the hospital. Cathy, we need to leave right now. It's mickey. Carrie gave him one of cory's donuts And he just started whimpering all of a sudden-- No. No. That can't be right. What? The powdered sugar on the donuts, I think there was poison in it. That's why we're sick. Are you saying that our grandmother Tried to kill us? You have a key. Now give it to me. No. Give it to me this instant! Seed of the devil! Give me that! You're never gonna leave this room! You're gonna hit me? You're gonna whip me? Come on! Come on. Do it. Beautiful, prideful. And weak! Just like your mother. That's not true. You were never meant to be born. You're a stain on the foxworth name! On the name of the lord himself. Now, if you give me that key, I may show you a little mercy. Christopher... Come on! Christopher... Let go! Cathy, go to the attic! No! Give me that! Come back here! Come back here! Carrie, please! Cathy! Why did you do that? Don't close the door. I need for the door to be open! No. Not the door. Don't turn off the light. Open the door! Turn on the light! What are you doing? No! No! Open the door! No! What are you doing? Like you said, God sees everything. He'll punish you for what you did to us. To cory. It wasn't me! It was your mother who poisoned you, not me! It doesn't matter anymore. [grandmother sobbing] Where are you going? Don't go! Don't leave me! Help! Help! Help! Cathy, we have to go. Be right there. Are you okay? Come on. I'll cut the electricity and meet you at the lake. No! No! We're not going without you. Hurry! We have to make this train. Stop! Stop, if you know what's good for you! Please... We're corrine's children. My god. Go. Before I'm sent after you! I'll cut the power on the fence. Go! We never have to see that place again, cath. It's all over. And for the first time in a long time, We felt alive, Free. We had everything ahead of us. But someday, we'd see mom again. And we'd look her straight in the eye, The children she once loved, And all our shame and hopelessness Would become hers.
