Until all men do not take positions for their beliefs same misfortune can happen to you each of you! Baby! Buford? Now is a year, right? I bet Mike thinks about his girlfriend. - Do not you, Mike? - Come on Carl. Give me that. Since his grandfather's say, Carl? I said that's okay, between us as adult men. Why? Have you ever thought about how I feel when I say an adult , Grandpa? If this chicken thing probably want to tell you and I by name. You could. Stay 's your hair grow some white and talk about it. Response. I bet the Lurner Jennie was given. Talk of little Jennie Lurner, they play last summer? It's not small, has some big tits. - Dwan, to shame. - But it's true. Okay, Grandma, I apologize. - It's not nice to talk like that. - Thus says everyone these days. - Pa tre` to go to school. - Pa. - See you soon, Buford. - However, it is high. Buford? Son to me about my father, clear? How do you tell me all the time? Know that Dwan is right, girl has some balconies... jerk you are! Today is one year old, Pauline. If I had listened, If you give up the post of sheriff, today you were still alive. Sorry. Me and children I painted the house a few weeks ago. A nice out. You always said to paint. Children is doing well. I miss you, baby. Would you like how things go here now. We still have some problems from time to time. But it's not like it was before, Pauline. That's much better. I have to go now. Bye, baby. We want to do it in a professional manner. We do not speak up, Pusser. Analyze your affirmations well. We have no solid proof, which to build the case. John Witter was behind ambush that killed my wife. And I know it, you know it. Think, serifs and trust us. But we can not prove. - No evidence, no witnesses. - What do you mean, no witnesses? What about Pinky Dobson and his girlfriend? Pinky Dobson paralyzed. Unable to testify. Girl is scared to death, and he retracted any previous statement. There's no solid evidence. I hear, sheriff? Evidence to prove that Witter ordered ambush. Your feelings for the deceased... died? Sir, talking to my wife. Your feelings for your wife... Thank you. I warn you to look at the problem from a proper perspective. Perspective? I want the fucking guy for first degree murder. To stay away from him. The day you shot Dobson, Witter went to New York, because he was frightened of what you could do it too. And we are afraid of the same thing. I warn you, Pusser. This will be resolved in a lawful manner. Legal manner, you've got it? Yes, Brownard, I understand. Thanks a lot, guys. Wait, Pusser. Come back here. - Lloyd, I want to talk to you. - Sure, Buford, what's wrong? Just came from the FBI. And Brownard I only mumble nonsense about legal how I am not able to catch him on Witter. Tre` to hear from you, Lloyd. So it works? You have said it correctly. So go law today. A work that way, but there's something wrong with the law that shielded the guilty , and do not care about the innocent. It's not fair. I know it's not right, Buford, but you must have patience. I do not have patience, Lloyd. I know that, Buford. But to have to leave it alone. Why? John Witter make a mistake these days. And you close it forever. But they should do it, not you. Buford, I want to be your more useful. It's not your fault, Lloyd. Thank you. That's all, Mr. Witter? Yes, that's all. Thanks so much. Pay attention to what I say. Pusser will make a mistake sooner or later. I still have eyes and ears out there. A to tell me when something happens. And then I was settle accounts with him once and for all. No, John. Haste you again. We do not have any game mechanic any distillery or prostitutes remaining in McNairy County. And caused us many problems Pusser, do not want back there. Get out of there, and recognize that you won. I leave my ass.

And I like Buford Pusser I say, we can achieve 3 devices. E-n outside the jurisdiction of his. And in addition to this, Bulow can handle any problem that might occur. Legality is not to question. You open 3 devils without my permission. Damn it to be, just e- in my territory. John, force things too much. - Want to hear less? - I do not want to listen. For the last time I say, to stay away from McNairy County. And that includes Connors. Let the Pusser to go to hell in his own way. Believe me, people like them, always fatigued to death. 3 Devils will remain open. Close it and get out now. You and the Buford Pusser damn. O tell us all about it. And now this doll. Johnny, give me that. Know how's this? Bulow, you son... What do you think, Lloyd? Going to be effective? Course it is effective. I have written reply. Fight law! I really want to fight in liabilities, to be re-elected. As several posters, not going to make you and the sheriff. I am not a politician, Lloyd. Point. I know that, Buford. But this lawyer, French, has initiated a campaign against you. There never liked him. Do you think might work for someone else ? No, not the case. Man is not that kind. But it's a real predator. 's A lawyer right, and pulls the nerves when someone does something civil rights. And Buford, not so help us to win the job. Can spanking of OQ, for some funny looks, but merely to win votes French. Give me a match. Bring newspapers and now. Not that says it's good or not, they will only exciting titles. Every time you walk by the rules, Buford, get a story in the newspaper. For example, the thing with guys handcuffed together. Making them mature lawn court. Buford... A group of people in McNairy County I that thy days as sheriff coming to an end. What did you do, Buford, is that you removed fears the people. Do not feel like you still need . It's human nature. Reason I stopped by, I'm going to a meeting later in court on citizens in McNairy County. And the French will be there. Buford, I think you should apologize . I do not mean that you should keep in a speech . If you hear what the French have said. Could you answer if you want. That's all. Lloyd, if I go to the meeting, and if I hold some people talk about what the soul, it would be fair to them. Hell, Buford, I think you make a big mistake. Then it first. Aaron, talk to him. I am not listening. Bye, guys. Lloyd... Thank you. Hello, sheriff. 501, Sheriff Pusser looking. Reception. 501 here. Buford, here's the sheriff Clegg. Come see us highway 22, the old Baptist church.

Was good enough to represent, to protect your rights before. And I think he is the man needed for the job. Thank you. Do not think anyone will ever forget what he did Pusser for us. All I'm saying, is that Buford Pusser I do not think it kind of man we need to represent us public order and peace in the land today. Looks bad, Buford. What are you? I wanted to see her. I think it's a bitch to 3 devices. US city crime. May know what name they gave us newspapers? Remember that? Pusser, cleaned offenders. A done a good job in his own way.

Because of the rain, few were to vote. In fact, it was so close, that they counted again at night. Si? At how close it was, you lose sheriff station. How to be a dad? Not to be sheriff? I will find something else to do, son. Go home, and start cleaning the fish. Wait, that I help you. - Hello, Richard, how are you? - Welcome back home, Mr. Witter. It's good to be home.

I say, Richard, home is home. Well you handle the task. Thank You. I was so disgusted as I stayed at the hotel. So damn was fired. Much I enjoy it. Elections have not changed much though. If you try to bring a hooker bus and slot machines, you'll have much trouble. Know that. Do not worry, Bob. I can wait. I have some other business outside the territory of McNairy. Seeing Buford Pusser, relieved badge and gun, pleases me so fucking much. Face wait easier. Can I serve a drink? I think you have kindly ask you to wait. E-usually serve you. Take liqueurs.

Let's move on Mike and Dwan north? Oh, no. Do not count on it. Something good, will be emerging here soon. I hope you're right, Mom. I hope in your heart. - Move your car on the road. - Do not do any damage. If I have no car, that does not mean that I have to road block. People come to see me later, and need place to park. We'll see about that, motherfucker. If I do not have any car it does not give any right to block my path . Like coming here as head over all. Do you want to stop, Mrs. Watley and listen to me?
