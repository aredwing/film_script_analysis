That a ghost called Shabbu liked. Till date no one knows Shabbu's story. And why she became a ghost. But Shabbu liked this house. And she even liked Nimmi, a small girl.. Who came to live in this house. Hello. Who is it? - This is Vinod calling from New York. Yes, sir. How did you call me? To whom have you given my house on rent? What's the matter, sir? Since the past three months they are neither answering the phone.. Nor replying to my emails. Trusting you I.. - Sir, I will go right away and check. Sir, I am calling from the bungalow. There is no one here. What do you mean there is no one? I mean, there is nobody in the house, sir. Their belongings? It's still here. But there is no one here. Did you check the entire house? Yes. I checked the entire house. There is no sign of any untoward event. Okay. Give the house to some other family on rent. If they return, we will see. What do you mean the entire family disappeared? As I told you, the owner had given this house to a family on rent. For a few months everything was fine. After some time they stopped paying rent. When they called up, no one answered. So ma'am, simple. The owner sent his agent here. When he reached here, he saw that the door was closed. And the entire house was empty. - But how? - What do I know? They must have fled to avoid paying rent. - But, Tarun.. - Yes, tell me. In today's world who does that? My dear Namrata, in today's world this is what everyone does. After sometime the owner called the agent and told him to give it on rent to some other family. And we reached here. But where did that family go? Well, as soon as they call me up, I'll definitely let you know. Stop joking, Tarun. It's not funny. I'm not joking. Just look at this house, Nammu. - But, Tarun.. - No buts. You won't find such a lovely house at this rate. Just look at this. We will make this the kids' room. Nimmi and Taman will freak out. Wow! Wow! Nimmi, I am faster than you. I am having fun and am fast also. Brother Taman, I am having fun. Wow! This is my bed. I have told you. No. Nimmi will make the choice first. Because she is the youngest. But where is Nimmi? Nimmi I am here, mummy. What are you doing up there? Come down. You are looking so funny. Come on. Come down. Come. Look, what I found. She is so cute! 'Videogame commentary playing in the background' 'Video game commentary playing in the background' Tarun, eat something and then go. No. No. Love you. Take care. Okay? Bye. Nimmi.' Nimmi.' Nimmi.' lam calling you for so long. Come for breakfast. Come on. Come. - Mama, can Shabbu also come? Yes. Bring her. Mama, Shabbu doesn't want to eat. Why, Shabbu? Why don't you want to eat? Stupid. That's dolly. So where is Shabbu? - Upstairs. In the room. Nimmi.' Daddy! Wow! Balloons! - That is my balloon? - Yes. Why are you crying? I have so many. Come on. I will tie it here. Papa, what if brother burst this as well? Then we will burst him. Do you like my balloon? - Pooja! - Surprise! Brother! - Wow! This is really a surprise. Hi, sister-in-law! How are you? - Hi. Wow! Amazing house! Pooja, when did you make the plan of coming here suddenly? You should have at least called up. - Yes. I just want to spend my holidays here. - Superb! Tarnan! Hey, my kiddo! Muscles and all. You look like Superman's father. Going to office? Go quickly and come back quickly. - So much to tell you. - Done. Sister-in-law, you make the best coffee in the world. Thank you. Tell me. How is your photography going on? Don't ask. My last photography assignment was literally in the jungle. It was a small village. But you know, outskirts. I forgot. Where is Nimmi? Must be upstairs in the room. Shall I call her? I will go upstairs and scare her. Pooja. How did you know it's me? Shabbu told me. Who is Shabbu? My friend. Where is she? Oh! So that's Shabbu? Stupid! That's a teddy bear. So where is Shabbu? I won't tell you. - Why? - Shabbu has forbidden me. Who is Shabbu? Oh, God! She told you also about Shabbu? There is no Shabbu. She is just her imaginary friend. That's it. But how did she know I am behind her? When you came here, you created such a racket. She must have heard you. What else? Who is it? Tarun! Tarun! Someone is knocking on the door. Tarun, someone is knocking on the door. Who will knock on the door at 2 o'clock in the night? You must have had a dream. Go to sleep. Who could it be? Who is it? Who is it? No! Let me see. - Someone is knocking but not saying anything. No! Someone knocked on the door? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Mama! Nimmi.' Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi. You got scared, dear? Nimmi. - Your papa was yelling at somebody else, dear. Nothing has happened. - Not at you. Nimmi, nothing has happened. Don't cry. - Don't cry, dear. - Mama! Nimmi.' - Okay. Okay. Sorry. - Nimmi. Nothing has happened, dear. Nothing has happened, dear. Don't cry. Maybe some neighbor's naughty child was knocking and playing a prank. Who will do I! At midnight? I don't know who it is. Lam just saying it's a possibility. It was very breezy last night. Is it that some object moved and we felt someone is knocking? Pooja, that was a natural knocking sound. And all of us heard it. Maybe we felt like that. Because why will anyone do it so late in the night? Stupid. It was Shabbu. What? Shabbu was knocking on the door. Who told you? Shabbu. When? Just now. Where is Shabbu? There. Here? Stop it, Pooja. You are talking as if Shabbu actually exists. Nimmi, come on. Come to your room. Nammu, just relax. - Namrata. - Mama. Namrata. Nimmi. You won't take Shabbu's name again. Look at me when I am talking to you. Don't take Shabbu's name again. Mama, don't say that. - Why? Why not? Tell me. Shabbu will get angry. I will beat you and your Shabbu. Enough. Shabbu. Shabbu. Shabbu. Enough. I will really beat you and your Shabbu. Understood? Brother, do you think Shabbu really exists? Pooja, she is a kid. And kids imagine such ridiculous things. Today it's Shabbu. Tomorrow it could be anybody else. Don't give so much importance. But last night that sound? Pooja, unnecessarily you are mixing both the things. Since the time we have shifted here.. Nimmi has been talking nonsense about Shabbu. And the sound last night, as we were discussing it could be anything. Don't be stupid enough to mix both these things together. Nimmi. She is sulking. I have warned her. If she takes Shabbu's name again, then that's it. She is a kid. You shouldn't scold her. What kid? Shabbu! Shabbu! Shabbu! I am fed up of hearing this name. - Sir. - Yes. In my village a small kid would also see things. Everybody said it's a ghost. Yes. The kid had befriended the ghost. And since then terrible things started happening in the village. What happened to the kid? The villagers burnt the kid. Shut up! Don't talk about ghosts here! Go and do your work in the kitchen. - Sir. Go! Idiot! This is the problem with the country. Half the time they are not educated. They talk nonsense. Namrata, this is all nonsense. Don't believe in all this. Tarun. Tarun. Nimmi. Nimmi. Don't laugh. I got so scared. Bhooooo.. Bhooooo.. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. What sounds are you making? What happened, sir? - Don't pretend. Why are you making such sounds? No. I didn't make any sound. Don't pretend. All of us heard it. You are making boo. Ma'am, believe me. I was sleeping here. Why will I make any sound? You are speaking the truth? - Yes. I swear on God, sir. Fine. Go to sleep. Sleep. He must have had a nightmare. That's why he was making such sounds. But sister-in-law, I don't think it was a human's sound. It didn't sound human. Whenever someone has a nightmare he makes strange sounds. Nothing to be worried of. - Sir. I didn't make any sound. Believe me. Believe me and perform veneration quickly. Lakshman! If you perform veneration, Shabbu will kill you. Nimmi.' Shabbu will kill you if you talk about veneration. Enough, Nimmi! Nimmi, what is this? How are you talking to Lakshman! Do you even know what veneration means? - No. - So? Shabbu told me. She doesn't like Lakshman. Nimmi, there is no Shabbu. It's all your delusion. No, mama. Shabbu exists. Why are you doing this, baby? We are so worried. Just see. Why are you doing this? Mama, I am speaking the truth. Shabbu gave me this doll. To play with. You said she found the doll in the room's loft. Now she is saying Shabbu gave it to her. She is concocting a story. Don't take her seriously. Tarun, you are talking about my six-year-old daughter who is talking about killing. Are you serious? - Brother, I don't think this is normal. Why will any kid behave like that? I think we should consult a psychiatrist. She is not crazy. Namrata, psychiatrists don't treat only insane people. It can be anything beyond our comprehension. It can be anything. Sister-in-law, he is right. We will have to take Nimmi to a child psychiatrist immediately. Yeah. I think Nimmi feels alone in such a big house. Taman doesn't play with her. So she has made an imaginary friend. She calls her Shabbu. All of you please tell Taman to play with his younger sister. Secondly, whenever Nimmi talks about Shabbu you give her importance. So she talks about Shabbu frequently to gain attention. Next time she talks about Shabbu, please just ignore her. Yuck! I won't play with a girl. Taman, she is your sister. Please, son. Be with her. - Taman. - Yes. - Wow! Games! - All are yours. Only if you play with Nimmi. Fine? - Okay. - Okay? - Yes. - Yeah. Take it. Yes! What are you doing, Nimmi? - Coloring. Alone? Or with Shabbu? Mama is not here. You can tell me. Shabbu is angry with me. Why? I won't tell you. How does your Shabbu look like? I won't tell you. But why? Shabbu will beat me. Shabbu is here? Yes. Where? Nimmi, will you play with me? Wow, Nimmi! You play so well! Right? Right, Tarnan? You are playing so well. You should play more, dear. Come on. Come on. Play more. Come on. Yeah! Sir! I heard voices. And when I came out, the shelf came in between on its own. Sir, I saw. Yes. I saw it myself. There is surely something here. I am scared. Ma'am, there is a ghost here. Believe me. Have some trust on me, ma'am. - Shut up! - Sir. - Shut up! - Why will I lie.. - Shut up! Nammu, go and check on the kids. Lakshman is behind all this. - Why will he do this? To prove a point. Lakshman says there is a ghost in this house. And we should perform veneration. I am absolutely convinced he has done this. So that we believe him. But what will he gain by doing all this? Just think. That night Lakshman made sounds from the kitchen and tried to scare us. When we asked him, he said he doesn't know anything. Last night the book shelf. He is up to something. - Brother. - Yes. Lakshman was present at both the times. It doesn't mean he did all this. We don't even have much proof. We will have to catch him red-handed. Pooja. Pooja. What are you doing here? Daddy, Shabbu has called me to play with her. How is the swing swinging on its own? She must have swung it. No, daddy. Shabbu is swinging it. What are you doing here? Nimmi, what are you doing here? Why aren't you in your room? All of you.. this. What's going on? What's going on? - Shabbu. - Shabbu. Shabbu. I am saying it repeatedly that whatever Lakshman is doing and Shabbu's matter, both are different. Stop mixing both the things. But why will Lakshman do that? As I told you, to prove his point that there is a ghost in the house. Logically speaking, when did all this begin? Since the time we came here. And since when is Lakshman with us? Since that same day. What do we know about Lakshman? - Nothing. - Nothing. He could be anything. For all you know, Lakshman can be insane. He can be anything. Daddy, where is my dolly? I don't know. Must be somewhere. Daddy, you are lying- Shabbu told me you have hidden my dolly. I will slap you if you take Shabbu's name. You will not gel the dolly. And henceforth if you lake Shabbu's name, I'll kill Shabbu. Understood? Go. Go from here. Nammu, what are you doing? You don't understand. I'm scared. When she takes Shabbu's name, I can't control. Nammu, just relax. Ignore her whenever she talks about Shabbu. Tarun, I am scared for myself. - I know. I am scared for her. I am scared to live with her. Just relax. Relax. We'll have lo think wisely and find a solution. Sister-in-law, what. What are you doing? Lakshman, make some tea. Lakshman, give me coffee. Lakshman, give me coffee. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. 'You are not just going to leave, are you?' 'Wait a second. Let's talk.' Brother, - Yes. - Lakshman isn't inside. He isn't? Nammu, has he.. - Has he gone outside? No. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. Lakshman. - Lakshman. - Lakshman. - Lakshman. - Lakshman. Lakshman. He doesn't go anywhere without informing. Let's wait for a bit. It might be that you yelled at him and he left in anger. Or might have run away out of fear. If that is the case, then it is good. I am fed up of hearing his constant rubbish about ghosts and spirits. Shall we complain to the police? Are you mad? Just forget him. I guess he must have gone back to his native place. I am sure about it. See, nothing happened during the night. As I was saying. Lakshman was doing all this. Everything has become alright as soon as he left. Did you notice? Nimmi has stopped talking about Shabbu completely. Yes. Correct. The sounds we would hear during the nights have also stopped. And the Shabbu issue is also over. Brother, you got to see this. Tarun, I don't want to be in this house even for a second more. Brother, we must leave now. Tarun, please. I'll go get the kids. Pack the bags. Fast. Come on. Hurry up. Taman. Taman, up. Up. I said get up. Up. Hurry up. - Tamanna. - What happened? - Namrata. Nimmi. - Yes! What? - Namrata. Namrata, Nimmi is not upstairs. What? I What are you saying? Nimmi isn't upstairs. - Pooja, did you see Nimmi? - No. She isn't upstairs? Just Just go and check it. - Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi-. - Nimmi. - She's not here. Nimmi. Taman, did you see Nimmi? - No. - Tell me the truth. She's not in my room either. Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi.' Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi.' Nimmi. No. She isn't outside either. - Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi. Nimmi. What's her age? Come again. - Six years. Six. Name? NH... - Full name. - Nimmi Awasthi. It could do with a little more sugar. Okay. - Enough? - Yes, enough. Your name? What's the point in knowing my name? Go and look for her first. I have been telling you since morning that my daughter is missing. Instead of doing that, why are bothered about these thing? Tarun. This is the procedure. Procedure, my foot! My daughter is missing and you are bothered about name and address. What is this happening? - Tarun. Tarun. - What? This is the procedure. We policemen have to follow the procedure. It's the rule. Okay. Okay- Tarun Awasthi. T-A-R-U-N. A-W-A-T-H-I. Write it down. My full name is Tarun Awasthi. That's it. - S is missing. - What? Yes. S. You forgot S. Spelling. Thank you. Daughter, Nimmi. Since when is she missing? I just told you that she is missing since morning. These days my memory has become really weak. Actually, what happened is. Look, we are least interested in your health history. We are not interested. Find my daughter first. And then you can write whatever you have to. - Do you have an enemy? - What? Actually, it could be a kidnapping. No. Do you suspect anyone? Look, we don't suspect anyone. Did I ask you? All of us are one. Everyone can't be one. Anyway- - Tarun. - What? What about Lakshman? Who is Lakshman? Lakshman was our servant. What do you mean by was? He isn't anymore? No. He is missing. He is also missing. Since morning? No. He is missing since yesterday morning. Have you lodged a police complaint? No. . Why? Look, my daughter is missing. Ask about her. All these things.. Did you lodge a police complaint? - No. We thought he went back to his native place. You don't think so anymore, isn't it? - No. Why did he go back to his native place? I yelled at him yesterday morning. - Why? He was doing weird things. What do you mean by weird things? I didn't get you. He was making weird noises. That's it. What noises? What do you want? I should make those noises for you? Brother - Please. My daughter is missing. Why aren't you asking about her? - Brother. - What? Just a minute. What? What? I guess we must tell him about Shabbu. Are you mad? Shabbu is a ghost. And what can police do about a ghost? But.. - What but? - Whatever Shabbu might be. We must tell the police. We might find out something. - Yes. Who's Shabbu now? Tell him. Well.. well, Shabbu is my daughter's imaginary friend. What do you mean by imaginary friend? Look, my daughter Nimmi thinks that she has a friend whose name is Shabbu. We don't think so. - She thinks so? - Yes. Yes. - You don't think so? - No. Why? - Because we have never seen her. No. Do you think she doesn't exist because you haven't seen her? Or are you sure that she doesn't exist? I don't think she's there. Okay? I think Shabbu is Nimbi's imagination. That's all. Oh God. That means you think Nimmi didn't go with Shabbu. It's not possible. It's not possible. - I want. Since the girl is missing, she must have gone with someone. Look, actually - Sir, I want to tell. Pooja. Pooja, what? What? Sir - Just a minute. Just a minute. Go on. Go on. Sir, I want to show you something. Go ahead. Tell me. Trick photography? Do you think we are filmmakers? We are showing you the material we have. Look. Look, it happened right here. Look. Look, we are showing you all the material. Shabbu. Nimmi. Lakshman. All that we told you about them. Investigate that and find my daughter. What. What are you looking at? Nimmi. Lakshman. Shabbu. I will investigate. Okay. Investigate and find my daughter. Yes. - Sister-in-law, we'll find Nimmi. Please. Don't cry, sister-in-law. The police will also help us. We'll find Nimmi for sure. You.. Please don't cry. Be strong, sister-in-law. They must be thinking that we are crazy. And why won't they? Nimmi. Shabbu. Lakshman. Even I find all this to be weird. I don't know what's happening. If something happens to Nimmi.. Nothing's going to happen to Nimmi. Then where is she? Why on earth did we move into this house? Little did I know? I didn't even believe in these things a few days ago. You think the previous family also went through this? I don't know. If we hadn't come to this house. Nimmi still would have been with us. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Daddy. Hello, Nimmi. Nimmi. - Where are you speaking from? Give me the phone. - Hello. Hello. Nimmi, where are you speaking from? From the room upstairs. What? I From the room upstairs. Brother "upstairs?" There is no phone in Nimmi's room. Brother. We had searched the entire house. Nimmi was nowhere to be found. And police too had come. And now this phone call. I don't think you should go up. Are you sure it was Nimmi on the line? Hundred percent, it was Nimmi. No doubt. Taman. Taman, come dear. Don't go up, brother. No. Don't go. - No. - Nimmi! Sister-in-law, please don't go. Brother, don't go. Nimmi. - Nimmi. - Sister-in-law, please listen to me. Don't go up. - She is my daughter.
