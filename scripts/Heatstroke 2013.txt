They're wrong. There's a lot more to them than that. Look at them. Hyenas are fierce hunters. They're all muscle, teeth. Their top speed is about 35 miles an hour. Now, the brain of the spotted hyena is unusually large in relation to its body size. Question is, why did these hyenas evolve such a brain? It could have been environmental challenges or... Or as with the human brain, it may have derived from them living in complex social groups. Now, over the past 18 months, we've darted and collared a few who I've come to know as individuals. I look forward to meeting up with them again on this next trip. Listen, observing the way these animals these animals live is far better than any show on television. (SIGHS) The boots seem tough to get off. So, how'd it go with the Sar people? (RUSSIAN ACCENT) They would be happy to have me teach search and rescue here in America. (CHUCKLES) (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) Come here. (CHUCKLES) I haven't taken the job yet. I wanted to talk to you about it first. (CHUCKLES) Well, what's there to talk about? Take it. Take the job. (LAUGHS) (CELLPHONE RINGS) - Do you need to get that? - No. (RINGING CONTINUES) (COMPUTER BEEPS) (SIGHS) Hi. - MIRIAM: God, finally! - What's going on? Jo and some friends got picked up by the cops. They had drugs! - Jo had drugs? - Weed, some pills. - I want you to take her with you. - What? Where? - On your field trip of course. - No, this is a work trip. We're gonna be out in the middle of nowhere. Exactly. Maybe you can get through to her, because I just can't. Let me talk to her. Jo! Jo! It's your father. Hi, dad. - What's going on, Jo? - Nothing. Nothing? Your mom said you got caught with weed and your friends had pills. What is going on? Oh, my God! I already told mom they weren't mine. She wants you to go on this trip with us. Yeah? What? You don't want to? (SCOFFS) Not with her. Well, Tally's nonnegotiable. Do you understand that? Doesn't she have some disaster to go to? She's taking some time off before she starts a new job. This is a holiday for her. (SARCASTICALLY) Great, a "holiday" with Tally. - Just what I always wanted. - Jo, come on, all right? Hey! Jo! Jo? Jo? She just walked off as usual. Listen, Miriam, I don't think this is a good idea. Our daughter is headed down a bad path, and I need your help. She needs you, Paul. Yeah, okay. You're right. Let me talk to Tally, and I'll call you back. (SCOFFS) Okay. So? Jo's hanging with the wrong crowd. (SIGHS) She's in trouble again. Miriam's beside herself. Wow. She's just 13. This is only the beginning. Miriam wants her to go with us. Hmm. I told her I'd talk to you first. I need to do this, Tal. I haven't been there as much as I should be. I know. But what will she do there, Paul? We've camped out in some pretty remote places before. Maybe it'll be good for her. She was a girl scout. She isn't a girl scout anymore. That's true. What can I say? Whatever you like. You always do. - Okay. - Thanks, babe. Hey... It'll be one hell of a trip, huh? You're in Africa, ladies. Hang on! Ow! (LAUGHS) (POP MUSIC PLAYING) You okay, Jo? (MUSIC CONTINUES) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) That's them. We're in the right place. That's the matriarch in the pack, an Alpha female. She has a dick? (CHUCKLING) Yeah. All females have a pseudo penis. They urinate, copulate, even give birth through it. Weird. We had hyenas in Southern Russia up until the late 19th century. (SARCASTICALLY) Fascinating. My grandmother told me about them. - She said... - And I care because? Jo! Look! That looks like Violet. (HYENA GROANS) I've known him since he was a cub. We name them before we know what sex they are. There's two more out there! You see that? She's the Alpha female right there. She's beautiful. (CAR DOOR SHUTS) Hey, what are you doing? I said to stay in the car. They're curious. They'll be over here in a minute to check you out. JO: Do they attack people? If they caught you asleep, they could take a chunk out of you, bite your head off. Yeah? (HYENAS CHATTERING) If you ever find yourself face-to-face with one, stay still, don't move. I mean it. Now I see why you brought me here. Why? So you could feed me to the hyenas. (CHUCKLES) Come on. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) Hopefully tomorrow we'll be able to observe some of their eating habits. How's that look? - That's good. - Okay. All right. (INSECTS CHIRPING) I know so little about this country. I feel like a tourist. Well, you are a tourist. (GASPS) I'm not... I'm not used to wearing a skirt. I like it. It's cool, and it keeps the sun off. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) - Jo, would you mind not doing that? - Whatever. I thought you might like to have some pictures of your "holiday"... (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) - so you can remember it. - I'll remember it. Jo, you're being annoying. Just kidding. I wouldn't mess with Tally, Jo. She's tough. She's got balls. Yeah, well, we know she's got your balls. Okay. What don't you drive, Tally? I'll sit in the back. Okay. Sure. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) You know, young teenage hyenas are always insecure about their rank in the clan, - especially the females. - (ENGINE TURNS OVER) They're always picking fights about their status. I want to talk to my mom. JO: It sucks here, mom. It's hot and boring. All anybody can talk about is hyenas. Hyenas, hyenas, hyenas... There aren't even water holes to swim in. There's just nothing. I really want to come home. MIRIAM: Okay. Well, let me talk to your father. Okay. Mom wants to talk to you. Hello? - You'd be glad to get rid of me. - No, Jo. I want this to work, for your dad's sake at least. He doesn't really care. I'm not a hyena. They'll always come first, you know? - (SCOFFS) Please. - (SATELLITE PHONE BEEPS) Your mom wants you to try a bit longer. So do I, Jo. All right, Jo, why don't you help Tally with the trailer? That's fine. I've got it. She's got it, dad. PAUL: Let me help you out. All right, Jo, well, you can help me chop some wood. Teamwork is essential. Gives you somebody else to blame. I'm going back to the tent. What? - I really thought she'd like it here. - She likes her iPad. So, what can we do? I got to talk to her. - I just wish... - What do you wish? Maybe you could try a little harder. She's just a kid. I've been in Haiti helping children who lost both parents. That's hard. This isn't Haiti. This is the way kids are. She's my daughter. Okay. I'll try. Why aren't there any birds or animals? They've probably gone somewhere else to find water. Sounds like they have more sense than we do. (CHUCKLES) - Do you like it here? - Yes, I do. (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) Stark and peaceful beauty. It sounds better in Russian. - Everything sounds better in Russian. - Then go back to Russia. - Please, Jo, can we just talk? - Aren't we talking now? Look... (SIGHS) we both love your dad, - and I'd really like to be your friend. - You'd really like to be my friend? Or do you think if we're friends my dad won't leave you, too? Why are you so angry? What did the world do to you? (SIGHS) When we were young, I would so adore you (MUSIC PLAYING) Do you ever wonder why wild animals sometimes eat their young? (CHUCKLES) And the sky is blue (MUSIC STOPS) Shit. (SIGHS) It's not working anymore. The battery is dead. Come on, Jo. Can you fix it, dad? - In the morning I will. - No, now! I don't understand you, Jo. You're acting like a spoiled brat. You're here because you were picked up by the police. - That wasn't necessary, Tally. - It's the truth. It's not your place to say. I know you feel guilt, but you can't let her get away with treating you this way. You're not a parent. You have no idea, all right? Come on, Jo, let's charge your iPad in the car. I'm sorry, dad. Consider the possibility, just consider it... that you could be here with us, with me, in a place that I love, a place where I work... and enjoy yourself. Take it all in without being on the iPad all the time. Will you do that? There's nothing for me here. It's fine for you and her. Can't I just go home, dad? If that's what you want, Jo, yeah, you can. But I need you to understand Tally's not going anywhere. I love her. In fact, she's relocating to the states. And I'd hope when we get back that you could put in a little effort. So you're not coming back to mom? No, honey. Your mom and I... We loved each other a lot, but in the end, we... we just wanted different things. Yeah, like she wanted you to be home once in a while. You left me, too, you know? I'm sorry if it feels that way. I would never leave you. I'm sorry, kid, but you're stuck with me. Mom says you just needed time. You'd have come back to us... If you hadn't met her. That isn't the case. It just isn't. Hey. If you think that one day I'm just gonna disappear and stop loving you, it won't happen. It never will. Okay? Okay. (INSECTS CHIRPING) (ANIMALS CALLING) (HYENAS CHATTERING) PAUL: Wow. Wow! TALLY: Look at that. They eat everything, bones and all. That's why people think of them the way they do. In some cultures, they're thought to carry the spirits of their ancestors, acting like guardians for their community. In fact, in most African legends, they associate them with the supernatural. (ANIMAL GROANING) Look at that. (HYENAS CHATTERING) Jo, come check this out. Jo? Where is she? Jo? Shit. Jo! Jo! Where are you?! Where could she have gone? - Jo? - Did something happen? Did you say something to her? No, I didn't. Jo! Jo, please answer! Jo! Jo! Jo! There she is. Jo! Hey! Jo! What are you doing? (CAR DOOR CLOSES) Getting a lay of the land. Why didn't you answer me? Did you think one of your hyenas got me? It's not funny, Jo. There's a lot of things that live out in the bush. They could be swift and silent and rip out your throat in a matter of seconds. Get down here and get in the car. Help me. You scared me. Jesus. Okay. All right. (SATELLITE PHONE BEEPS) Tally, we're gonna let Jo go home. I just talked to Miriam. It's just not working out this trip. Maybe next time. So, we'll take her to Johannesburg, we'll put her on the plane, and her mom will meet her on the other side. - Not we. - What do you mean? I'll stay here. No, I want you to come with us. You two need some alone time. You owe that to her and yourself. Okay. I'm sorry about last night. I didn't mean to snap at you. You were right. I don't know about being a parent. No, you were right. I let my guilt get in the way. I just hope all this didn't... didn't destroy anything between us. - We won't let it. - You sure about that? In my family, it was always civil war. So, I thought I'd be better off on my own... Until you. You're my family, Paul... Even if I have to share you with the hyenas. So, if the generator fails, you can always use the satellite phone on the solar, as well. I know how to use a satellite phone. Okay. - Don't forget this. - Thanks. (SIGHS) - See you in a few days. - Mm-hmm. Jo? (CAR DOOR CLOSES) Have a good trip. - You all set? - JO: Yeah. All right. So, will you miss me? (CHUCKLES) I have to remember you to miss you. (BAG ZIPS) (ENGINE TURNS OVER) Don't you ever marry me, Tal. Don't worry, I won't. So, don't you ever ask! Jo... Dad... You're not doing drugs, are you? What? No. Come on! Because if you are, I would just hope you'd be honest with me... 'cause I care about you. (SIGHS) I'm your dad. I love you, Jo. I love you, too, dad. Okay. - What's that? - What? Over there. (BREATHING DEEPLY) (CLATTERING) (HYENAS GROWL) (HYENA CHATTERS) (HYENA WHIMPERING) (HYENA GROWLS) - (GASPS) - (HYENA CHATTERS) (STATIC) (HYENAS SNARLING) TALLY: Where are you, Paul O'Malley? After you left, two hyenas broke into the supply tent and knocked over the table. I lost most of the water, the satellite phone is dead... and whenever I see a dust devil out there, I think it's you coming. I am now out of water. So, I'll follow the map to the next water hole, and I'll wait for you there. (ANIMAL CALLING) (METAL CREAKING) (GASPS) (SIGHS) (RUSTLING) (GASPS) (BIRDS CAWING) (HYENA SNARLS) (HYENA SNARLS) (HYENA CHATTERS) (BIRD SCREECHES) (GASPING) Paul! (BREATHES SHAKILY) PAUL: Will you miss me? (CRIES) (HYENA GROANS) (GASPS) Jo! Drink, Jo. You have to drink. Okay, good. (WIND WHISTLING) I lost Paul. I will not lose you, too. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Somebody is coming. - It's them! - Pack the bags. We'll move all this stuff. Over there! Get the cover. (HEAVY-METAL MUSIC PLAYS) They've come back to get me! - They won't find us. - (BREATHING SHAKILY) We'll stay down here until they go. Look at me. They won't get you. (HEAVY-METAL MUSIC PLAYS) (ENGINE SHUTS OFF) (INSECTS BUZZING) (SIGHS) (SNIFFS) - (BOTH SIGH) - Nice. Yeah, not pretty, but a hell of a shot, bud. No sign of the girl. (GROANS) I wonder how long she lasted out here? Not long. You should have let me shoot her, too. Would've been kinder. Oh, what can I say? Wrong place, wrong time. Ooh! (SIGHS) (ZIPPER UNZIPS) (HYENA CHATTERS) (URINATING) (CHATTERING CONTINUES) What the fuck. - Foy! - Fuck off. (GUN COCKS) (HYENA CHATTERS) (GUNSHOTS) What the fuck is wrong with you, man? (LAUGHS) What's wrong with me? Bang! (LAUGHS) You finished? You had your fun? Let's get him in the ground. I'm not touching that stinking bastard. You shot the fucker. Now, you lay off the booze, and you clean up your bloody mess. Someone had to do it. He'd seen the guns in the back. What would you have done? Just driven off? (ENGINE TURNS OVER) (ENGINE REVVING) Whoo! (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) (ENGINE SHUTS OFF) (SIGHS) That's it. Go on. The wind will soon level it out. (SATELLITE PHONE RINGING) Yo. MALLICK: What the hell are you doing out there? - Listen to me. - Yeah. - They're waiting for you at the border. - Yeah. - Get the hell out of there. - Yeah. - Now! - We're on our way. Who were you talking to there? Mallick. He wanted to know where the fuck we are and what's taking us so long. What'd you tell him? That you saw an opportunity to pick up a couple of rhino horns and you couldn't control yourself. (LAUGHS) No. I told him that some guy approached us while we were loading the weapons, and you... you took care of it. Okay? - Now, finish the job. - (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Whew! (HEAVY-METAL MUSIC PLAYS) You can stop doing that now. We're far enough away. (RETCHING) You shouldn't throw up your food. We don't have much left. - Well, you're feeling better now. - I'm hungry. There's some food in the bag. We have to cut back every day. If we're careful, we can make it through. Isn't that a road? If we could get there, someone might pick us up. That's exactly where those men will look for us. We'll follow the water holes that are marked. But where are we going? This small town, the only one within 100 miles. You keep the map. You can be the navigator. (SIGHS) Keep your clothes on and your skin out of the sun. Be careful where you put your hands and feet. If we get separated, stay where you are. I'll find you. He stopped. - He shouldn't have stopped. - Why? Why did he stop? - What's that? - What? Over there. Hold on. Let's check it out. (ENGINE SHUTS OFF) Stay here for a second. (CAR DOOR OPENS) - Hey, guys. - (CAR DOOR CLOSES) Everything's fine. We got it under control. What's the problem? You need some help down here? They looked like they needed help. He said it's the law of the desert. Who the fuck are you? - What the hell are you doing, man? - Listen, buddy... You... fuck off. Get in your car and go. Jo, get in the back. Just get down. - What do you think you're doing, man? - Listen. Just chill. (ENGINE TURNS OVER) Foy! Foy! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Foy! (GUNSHOT) (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) You should have come with us. You could have stopped him. I only left because you were here! If you weren't here... I would have stayed with him! He's dead because of you. (CRIES) (INSECTS CHIRPING) Jo? Jo? Jo? Jo, what are you doing? Hello there. (CHUCKLES) Where did you come from? We need help. Is someone else out there? Tally. She came here with me. Come on. Better sit down. So, uh... She needs some help... and you need some water, don't you? You got a vehicle out there, any means of communication like a satellite phone I can contact her on? Wow. Some grapes? Where are you heading? The nearest town.... miles away from here. On foot? (LAUGHS) Crazy. I can help you. Just point to me where she is, and I'll take my vehicle and go and pick her up. In this kind of territory, we always look out for each other. Isn't that true? (ENGINE SHUTS OFF) MALLICK: Finally joining us? Thank you very much. - Who the fuck is she? - I was waiting for you to explain. I've never seen her before in my life. (CHUCKLES) - Hey. Hey, hey. - No! Hold it right there. Easy. Sit down. (BREATHING SHAKILY) Now, for a kid that you told me had a bullet in her head, she seems to be doing quite well. - Well, we thought... - Thought what? The desert would take care of her. Yeah, but I'll take care of that right now. MALLICK: Put it back. Put it back! You see, there's a woman out there. As long as we've got the kid here and the kid is alive... that woman won't go anywhere. Just one thing. What exactly happened out there, huh? (CHUCKLES) - Got soft for women and kids, did ya? - We never saw anyone else. - It's true. When we got there... - Shut... up! Come on, guys, are we on the same page? (LAUGHS) I'm running a million-dollar operation here. You're doing runs, nothing else. No fucking around. Leave no witnesses behind. Am I right or wrong? What's up? Who is she? Where did she come from? Foy, better clean up the mess you put us in. Get that woman. You heard me. Get the woman. Then you can come back and play with the kid. - What woman? What mess? - Well, who's gonna do the run? I guess you are. Foy fucked up again. Foy, you fucking loser! Consider it done. Thanks. Dibs... Sir? Take the girl. Put her in the tent. Don't fuck up again, Foy. Who are you? We'll take care of you. Mm. Have some. It's good for you. (SMOOCHES) (DIBS INHALES DEEPLY) (SNIFFS) That's top-of-the-line surveillance there. Can pick up a roach crawling through the sand. Your friend's got no chance in hell... Not with me watching. (CRIES) You got to keep your eyes focused. (WHIMPERS) Focused. 'Cause the sand patterns... the sand patterns, they can be very tricky. FOY: I told you we should have killed her. Shut up, Foy. (GRUNTS) DIBS: Have to keep a careful watch, 'cause something can just pop up. You know? Things can be hiding in the sand. (INSECTS CHIRPING) (TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS) (INHALES DEEPLY) (SIGHS) Mmm. Mmm. - (GUNSHOTS) - Oh! Don't do that again. Tie her up this time. (GUN COCKS) What the... (GROANS) (GAGGING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Oh! (GRUNTS) Ahh! (GUNSHOT) That takes care of that. (INDISTINCT TALKING) Look at this beauty. (CHUCKLES) This is the new version of the PSG1. Sniper rifle. (INDISTINCT TALKING) TALLY: Jo. You can bring down a jumbo jet with this bitch. Ooh. - DIBS: Anyone ever done that? - Not that I know of. Always a first time, my friend. (LAUGHS) Let's go. (SATELLITE PHONE RINGING) MALLICK: Hello. Uh-huh. What do you mean... Well, my guys are doing a drop-off, so I'm running a little short on that. Check that out. (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) Foy, is that you? Foy?! Fucking shit! - Don't move! - Tally! Just don't move! (SNAKES HISS) (GUNSHOTS) - What the hell are you doing? - She's gone! - Get down here. - Huh? You heard me. Get down! Shit. Where the hell are you going? - You're gonna let her go? - We'll get her in the morning. She's not gonna get far. I'll have the plane track her down. Go! (SNAKE HISSES) I need you to do this pick up, or I'll be the one in a shallow grave. Tally! Tally! TALLY: (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) I shouldn't have done that. I could have disabled him. But I killed him. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (HYENA SNIFFING) (HYENA GROWLING) (HYENA SNIFFING) (HYENA CHATTERING) (HYENAS CALLING) (INSECTS BUZZING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Guess we're not dealing with a fucking housewife. (GASPS) Those men will come after us, won't they? They'll have to. We saw too much. I shouldn't have walked into that camp. No. - I didn't know. - I know. Can't we stop for a little longer? No. Each hour we walk, we are widening the search area. The wider it is, the harder it will be for those men to find us. Ow. Let's go. (ZIPPER ZIPS) Come on. (SIGHS) (BREATHING SHAKILY) (PANTING) (INSECTS BUZZING) Don't, Jo! What now? We can't drink it. It will make us sick. - Why did we walk all this way then? - Because we didn't know. - (WATER BOTTLE CLANGS) - That's so stupid! Mm. (BREATHES DEEPLY) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (SOBS) Shh. (SNIFFLES) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS) Run, Jo, run! (COUGHING) Tally! Tally! (WIND HOWLING) (COUGHS) - No! - Jo! Jo, where are you? (GASPS) (GASPS) Jo! Are you all right? After the storm passed, I couldn't see you. It was like the earth swallowed you up. One minute I grabbed the journal, the next I was in this bush. DIBS: I'm coming in to circle the area now. MALLICK: Yeah, thank you, Alpha one. Thank you. Do you think it's them... looking for us? Let's not take a chance. DIBS: I thought I saw something move down there. Check it out. Circle again just to make sure. Roger that. All clear. No sign of life. I'm off. Okay. Just look at the water hole again. Okay. They couldn't have gone far... not in this heat. (ENGINES TURN OVER) JO: It looks like there's only one more water hole before that little town. Come on. Let's go. Ah! My leg! Something bit me! Oh! (GASPING) Just hold on. I'll get the stuff from the first-aid kit. (GASPING) (GASPING) Relax, Jo. (GASPS) This is adrenalin I'm giving you. You need this, too. Anti... antihistamine. You must. Try to breathe slower. (GASPS) Slower... Slow breaths. I'm gonna make a run to the water hole. I'll be back as soon as I can. Promise me... Slow breaths. (AIRPLANE FLIES OVERHEAD) (PANTING) (AIRPLANE FLIES OVERHEAD) (AIRPLANE FLIES OVERHEAD) (PANTING) Okay, boss. Left. (HYENA GROWLING) (HYENA SNARLS) (HYENA GROWLS) (HYENA SNIFFING) (HYENA GROANS) (HYENA GROWLING) (GUNSHOT) (DISTORTED) Get up. Get up! (NORMAL VOICE) I have a daughter, too. Now go. Now! Go! (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOTS) I didn't sign on to kill women and kids. Huh? (CHUCKLES) You know what I have to do next. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, man. (CHUCKLES) (GUN COCKS) Bodley... (GUNSHOT) (GRUNTS) (ENGINE TURNS OVER) PAUL: The incredible thing about the hyena is how it'll fight to its death for something much bigger than itself. They'll defend themselves and their young right to the end. (HYENA CHATTERS) (HYENA GROWLS) (ENGINE SHUTS OFF) (HYENA CHATTERS) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (METAL CREAKING) (SIGHS) Jo! Jo! He was here again... just like the other morning when you were asleep. Dad. It was dad. I know. I've seen him, too. Come on. Let's go. You're okay. You're fine. The doctor examined her. MIRIAM: She's okay, right? Is she awake? She is sleeping more normally now. (SIGHS) I've been going out of my mind trying to figure out what could have happened. I'm so sorry, Tally. I'll be on the next flight. (RECEIVER CLICKS) (CRIES) (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) Miss Rubin, we should really take a look at that leg now. (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) You slept for over 24 hours. It's hardly surprising after everything. - Where's Jo? - Her mother came and took her. - How is she? - She's feeling better. She didn't say goodbye. I read about you two in the newspaper, about what you did... And about her dad, too. I'm really sorry. (BREAKS SQUEAL) (CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) JO: I will never do drugs again. I've had more than enough of that. - MIRIAM: And that's what kept you alive? - No, Tally did that. Here. It's a cheeseburger and milkshake... chocolate. Sorry I drank some of it. (CHUCKLES) I didn't realize one wasn't going to be enough for me. Hey. Honey, I'm really sorry, but if we miss this plane... There won't be another for days. I know. That's right. What are you gonna do? I promised to go back. I need to say goodbye. Mom, I want to go with her. I want to say goodbye, too. Honey... It's a miracle you survived. It's no miracle.
