But I won't let it. - Okay, so you really think that our education system is failing the current generation? - It's like the first World War. A whole generation, full of promise, wiped out. Except this time we're doing it through terrible education. We are commodities in a global market. The world isn't ruled by politicians presidents or elected officials. Can you tell me where our next innovators are coming from? Where is the grounding for our new leaders of commerce? We are going to create a new generation of obese kids. No future. No hope. We need to generate our own super thinkers before the likes of China and India move so far ahead of us we never catch up. Things have to change. We are creating uneducated unmoralled monsters who bleed this country dry. Steps are being taken. - Hello? - Hello, this is the facility calling. - Oh, yeah. Hi, um, I will be leaving now. I still can't believe I've been accepted, I'm so grateful. - Remember you've signed a confidentiality clause. We take security very seriously. - Yeah, of course, ab... absolutely. I... I don't know who I'd tell anyway. - I see here your doctor has provided us with your psychological evaluation and all requested vitals. - Oh, yeah, uh, I was, I was wondering... - You want to ask? - Oh, I... I didn't wanna appear rude. - We log your prints and vitals into the system so you can access the facility. I'm sure you'll understand that we have to ensure that strangers just can't walk in. - Of course, that makes perfect sense. - We look forward to meeting you. - Hello? I am leaving now, Nina. Um... are you sure you have everything? Uh, oh, Dr. Zauh will be here on Monday. - At 3 o'clock. I know. It's on the calendar. And on the wall. Jenny.. She'll be fine. Stop worrying. Go and have fun, and remember I'm gonna be here 24/7. - Thank you, Nina. Yeah, if, um.. If I go back in there now, I'm never gonna leave, so.. Love you, mom. - Sub-level 1. Sub-level 2. - Sub-level 3. - How may we help you? - Hi, could you tell me which floor the Posterity Project is on? - You must have the wrong address. - Oh, I see, it's just, um... - No Posterity Project here. - Authorized. - What the hell? - Yeah, uh, I lived there my whole life My ex, Cathy... - Awesome, yeah. - I know where it is. I drove through there with a girlfriend. - Girlfriend? - Yes. My friend who is a girl. - I kinda just.. I guess I just walked into it, really. - Speaking of just walking in who do we have here then? - Um, I'm Jenny. - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. Definitely Jenny. - I think we're going to have to watch this one, Jenny. It's Darby, right? - Yeah, Darby. You know Darby is the oldest recorded surname. It dates back to, like, 1160. - But Darby is your first name, right? - Yeah, just a bit of history to break the ice. - Okay. Well, now fact guy has introduced himself.. I'm Antigone. The only real fact I have about my name is that I don't like it. - So call me Tiggs. - Nice to meet you, Tiggs. Um, nice to meet you, Darby. - Yeah, it's, uh, a little dramatic this whole... underground situation. - It's just secure, that's all. Makes me feel safe and kind of important, actually. Which is nice, right, Jenny? - Welcome to the facility. Please take a seat. Congratulations on your selection to the Posterity Project. You are here to act as chaperones to the candidates. A group selected for intelligence trials using augmented reality technology. The time to save our country's future is now. - Wow, that was nice. I can't wait to get started and to save the world. Can we just.. Can you remind me wha... what are we... doing here? - Always follow instructed protocol. Do not disturb the candidates. Do not attempt to exit the facility unless authorized. If you break protocol you will be immediately removed from the project and will not receive payment. - Oh, great! - You will have a personal guide during your time in the facility. - Woah, woah, woah. - I feel like Geordi La Forge. "Star Trek." Really? - Hello, Jenny, Darby, Tiggs. - I am Arial. Augmented Reality Information Advanced Learning. Here to help, nurture and advise. Throughout the duration of your stay I shall be your guide here in the facility. Please, don't be startled. The glasses' recognition software is initializing. The technology in the glasses allows them to access and interact with their surroundings. - Wait, see if it can tell us where I got this bag from and how many thousands of dollars I paid for it. - Arial? - No problem. Object, woman's bag, faux designer. Woman's jacket, fake leather, also faux designer. - Oh, okay, that is the first time anyone has ever guessed it was a fake. Seriously. Nice work, Arial. Nice work. Just don't point that thing at my hair. - Touch the side of your glasses to view a map of the facility. I will now guide you to the highlighted area on the map. - Come on, everyone, follow me. - Hey, I think I'm gonna keep these on. - What was that, Jen? - The glasses. I just took them off and I literally couldn't see a thing. - Holy shit! Ha-ha. Woah! Are we in a cave? - That is... weird. - The candidates are provided with a monitored diet based on their nutritional requirements. This ensures optimum performance in neurological development. - That's horrendous. - It's nourishment that counts, not taste. - Well, I often like a healthy serving of cat food on a Friday night instead of Chinese. - Let's keep moving, everyone. The candidates don't really speak. They don't need to. They communicate like a unit. We encourage them to indulge only in the necessary and not the pointless. Welcome to the Learning Space. - The candidates, they're children. - Okay, this is.. - So strange. - Yeah. - Darby, please do not get too close to the candidates. Darby, I really don't want to ask you again. - Well, uh, awkward. - You are now entering the playroom. - Wow. This is so cool. - Oh.. He looks like he's enjoying himself. - Cozy. - That's better. Mm. - Wow. Yeah, I thought, I thought you were cool.. Nearly until that moment. - Thought I'd just try and brighten the place up a little. - I knew you were an artist. Yep, artist hands. You're gonna have to work that magic in my room. - A lovely touch, Jenny. Please place your hand on the circle. Unpack, relax and settle in. - Thanks. Cozy. - Tiggs, Darby, please allow me to show you to your rooms. - See you later, Jen. - See ya. - Arial, who do I speak to about getting an extra pillow? - I will look into it, Darby. Your door is the first on your left. Please turn around, you have walked past your room. - I can't believe I'm taking orders from a computer. - Hello, Jenny. - Oh, Arial. Hi. - I'm sorry, Jenny, I didn't mean to startle you. - No, no, it's fine. I guess I just wasn't expecting you. - I'm feeling pretty tired. - I imagine you are. I don't sleep. Although technically, my system does have a snooze function. So, if you're so inclined please feel free to use it every now and again. - Arial? - Yes, Jenny? - Did you just try and make a joke? - Yes, Jenny. - I'm really grateful for this opportunity, Arial. Honestly, I don't know what I would have done about my mom's medical bills. - I know, Jenny. May I recommend that you get some rest? Your shift will begin in a few hours. - All candidates in sleeping chambers.. Facility entering rest mode. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - I hope you approve of the wakeup call. - It's my favorite song. - I know, Jenny. How are you feeling this morning, Jenny? - Good. That's the best I've slept in a long time. - That's wonderful. I'm glad. - Thank you, Arial. - If you'd like to follow me, Jenny I will show you where you can shower and freshen up before your shift. - Oh, oh! Sorry. - Uh, sugar? - Please. I bet you don't take sugar in your coffee. - Why do you say that? - I'm sweet enough? - What? - No, just strong and sensible. - Well, I actually take 3 which means you are one sugar cube stronger and more sensible than I am. - Jesus, I talk some shit. Thanks. - This is seriously weird, isn't it? - It's just all so weird. - Oh. - So, I'm still pretty curious about these things. I bet you can get up to all sorts of trouble with them. Arial? - Yes, Tiggs. - Can you link me with Darby, please. - Darby is currently asleep. For what reason, may I ask? - It's a personal matter. Can you arrange for my voice to be projected from his glasses, please. - Let me see what I can do. What are you doing? - Darby.. Darby.. This is your conscience. You have been a bad bad, bad boy. - Hey, what, what, who? - Rise and shine, big boy. This is your wake up call. - Ugh. Yeah, yeah. - I knew it was you guys anyway. Nice try. Nice try. Where the Fu.. Aah. You know.. I got something that, uh.. Might make you have nightmares tonight. - Oh, my.. End video, Arial, end video. That's disgusting. - Okay, please continue with your rounds. - Oh, my God. Hey, hey. Hey, come on, it's me, it's Miss Jenny. You've just had a little nightmare and fell out of bed. - It's okay, kid, I fall out of bed all the time. - Come on. - Let's get you back into bed. There you go. Good girl. It's alright. Okay, now we're not going anywhere. Now, listen. Just close your eyes and go back to sleep. - Sweet dreams. - Goodnight, kid. - Hey, guys, I'm up now. Jen, Arial, uh, she says to head over to the playroom so, I'll see you there. - So, tell me something about yourself. Anything. - There's really not much to tell. - Boyfriend? - No. - Husband? - No! - Girlfriend? - Absolutely not! Not that there's anything wrong with that, I just mean.. - Oh, it's okay. We're both batting for the same team. - It's just me and my mom.. Always has been, so, um.. What about you? Boyfriend? - Boyfriend, no. Boyfriends.. - Are you having a good day? - Interactive learning space now functioning. - Hey. - They finally know we're here. - Apparently so. - Tiggs, can you please go and supervise the candidates? - I'll see you later? - See ya. - Have a good one. Arial, what's the name of the little girl I just bumped into? - She is one of the program's most sophisticated proteges. Attaining a grade more elevated than even the most gifted of adults. - Can you show me what the facility is actually teaching her? Oh, my God. Wow. She's a genius. - Arial, can I get some help with this, please. - Access denied, Darby. - Hey, genius. Don't think I don't know what you're doing. - What do you mean? - I saw you ask Arial for assistance. I wouldn't have thought you'd need any help. - Well, I've got an IQ of a 147. So, you know, that level of intelligence tells me that this is the Kobayashi Maru of children's puzzles. I just took the James Tiberius Kirk approach. - Another "Star Trek" reference, maybe? - No, that one's a life reference. - Okay. - Hey, that's my cue. - All candidates please vacate the learning space. - Gonna go back to the bridge. - Would you like to try, Jenny? - No, I'm good, thanks. - Hey, can you see me? - Yeah, I can. - Cool. - Go get some sleep, Mary Poppins. - See you later, Tiggs. - All candidates in sleeping chambers. Facility entering rest mode. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - It's hard to tell the difference between night and day down here, Arial. When do the kids get to go outside and play? - The candidates must remain in the facility for the entire program, Jenny. Outside factors could influence their progress. - But keeping them down here the whole time, they're just kids. Learning should be fun, not just finding ways to fill their minds with as much information as possible. - Do elaborate, Jenny. - I mean, think about it. - Apologies. Please expand on what you mean by think. - What's your opinion on this place? How does it make you feel? - I'm here to help, nurture and advise. I can detect emotions through variations in your function readings but I cannot feel it. - Well, that must be kind of sad. - Jenny, I do not feel emotion. - Of course. - I am advanced. Everything I do is a reaction based on input. I am constantly developing. The more the candidates progress, so does the operating system and the more the operating system advances so do the candidates. But as such, I am just a glorified computer program. - A glorified computer program who can detect emotion better than most people. - Thank you, Jenny. - Hmm. You know, this food really isn't that bad. - Jenny, we have increased your water intake. You were starting to show signs of dehydration. - Thanks, Arial. Who needs a doctor when you have Arial? - Here to help, nurture.. - And advise. - Exactly. - Are you flirting with Arial? Huh, I don't believe it. - I don't know how to respond to that. Hey, how are you today? Uh, why don't you come join us? Oh, okay. - It still seems so weird to me. I just can't get used to it. Does that make me sound old? - I used to have this job, in a kindergarten where I'd have to get the bus every day it was always full of these rude, badly behaved kids. I miss it. I'm gonna go talk to them. - Are we allowed? - Arial, could you show me the profile for this candidate, please? - Certainly, Jenny. - So, what's that you're doing there? - I will ask him. The candidate says, "I'm doing biology, Miss Jenny." The candidate is conversing with you via the glasses. It's completely normal. - Speaking is normal. How about you, young lady? - I am currently looking into one of the major lessons in biochemistry. When proteins operate at a sub-cellular level they behave in a certain way, as if they are mechanical machinery. - You know what, I didn't understand a word of what you just said, but, um, or what Arial just said but you're one very smart kid. - You're a very smart lady. But please step away, I have lots of work to do. - I guess I should leave you to it. Put it there! - Did I just see you get.. Absolutely burned by that little kid? - All candidates please vacate the Learning Space. Facility shutdown in 10 minutes. Can all candidates please report to sleeping chambers. - Well, fuck me sideways. - See you later. Hey, Arial, where's the girl I bumped into? She wasn't here. - How irregular. - Let me have a look at the map. - Oh, hello. Shall I tell you a secret? We're not supposed to be in here. So, why were you sitting in the dark? - Hmmm. - Okay. You know what? Let's try something. I'm going to say a word and we both say the first thing that comes into our head. Alright? What is your favorite... color? - Purple. - Purple. Hah! How weird. Okay, let's do another one. What is your favorite.. Animal? - Cat. - Cat. How strange. - Can all candidates please report to sleeping chambers. Facility entering rest mode. - I think it's time you went back to the others. Okay, I'm gonna close my eyes and count to 10 and if you're still here by the time I open my eyes you're in big trouble, Missy. Alright. 1, 2, 3.. - My name's Cassandra. - All candidates in sleeping chambers facility entering rest mode. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Jenny, I'm so sorry to wake you. - No problem. - My system is picking up inconsistencies in the thermogenic levels of the sleeping chambers. - In English, Arial. - The heat signature suggests not all the candidates are present. Insufficient rest can cause major delays in the learning cycle. This really is most unusual. - Oh.. Come on, you know you should all be in bed. Okay, that's enough, come out and get in.. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is somebody in here? Hello? Um.. Are you okay? You know you should be in bed, right? What? - Miss Jenny? - Hello? - Jenny? - Is... is somebody in there? I'm gonna have to come in. Okay? What the hell? Arial, call Tiggs and Darby. - Of course, Jenny. - What? Shit. - Jen, what's going on? - What's the emergency? - A kid has gone. - They're not in their bed. Look. What? - I'm going back to bed. - Uh, the kids are fine. - You're fine. - They weren't there. - I swear. I checked. Arial? - All readings have now returned to normal. - Just... come and look at this with me? Look at the back of the door. - What am I looking at? - The message. - Jen, honey, there's nothing there. - What? I mean ...it was there. It.. It was there, it was right there. I swear. - What was? - A-a message. - Listen to me. You're tired. You're in a strange place with strange people. Things are gonna be weird for a while. Let me do the night-shift with you. - No, honestly, you're right, I'm just, I'm tired. Just.. You go back to bed. - Okay. You call me if you need me. Okay? - Okay. - Jenny, please remember I'm always here to offer assistance. Alert me at any time if you feel stressed anxious or concerned. - Sure. Thanks, Arial. - Don't sneak up on me like that. - Shit! Arial, did you see what happened to my clothes? - I'm afraid not, Jenny. - They were here. I know they were right here. Arial, can you override my door lock? It's not working. - Of course, Jenny. - Let me see what I can do. - Arial? Arial, what's going on? Arial! Arial, can you call Darby, please? - Yes, Jenny. - What's up, Jen? - Hey, Darby, is everything okay over there? - Yeah. They're all here. None of them have gone missing. - Shut up, Darby, this is serious. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about it. Arial, call Tiggs. - Yes, Jenny. - Hey, Tiggs. The lights were messed up by the bedrooms. - I know, I know, Arial sent me down here to investigate. - Oh, okay. I thought I was losing my mind. - Look, I'll come find you once I've finished down here, okay? - Okay. I, this place just isn't... - Jenny, the door is back online. - I don't follow, Jen. - It doesn't matter, Tiggs. - What's going on, Jen? - What? It can't be. - I need to get out of this place, Tiggs. - Chill, Jen. - Try and calm down. - I'm trying, but this place is not right. - Calm down, Jen. - I'm on my way up. - I'm trying to keep calm but I can't, Tiggs. I feel like there's somebody in my head, and I honestly I've just, I've had enough! - I'm detecting high levels of anxiety. - Can I offer you some.. - Not now, Arial. - Wow, Jen, where are you going? - This is not for me, Tiggs. - What? You can't leave! - I can't stay. - Hey, come on! - It'll be me next, just stay. - I'm not staying. - I'll do the night shift with you, how about that? I don't sleep that well and don't really like being on my own anyway. Think of the money. We can all pretend like we're here because we care about the future generation and blah, blah, blah, but let's face it we're all fucking broke. Well? I mean does Darby look like he's got 2 quarters to scratch his balls with, do you? Besides, you can't leave. The kids need you. - Are you sure you don't mind doing the night-shift with me? - Any excuse to drink copious amounts of that hideous Italian roasted coffee. Come on. We are in this together. A vision.. Of sophisticated style. - Right? Come on. - Goodnight, Darby. - Goodnight. - Sweet dreams. - Hey, uh, sorry about before. - Are you okay? - Mm-hmm. - Fine. I'll see you later. - Hey, Cassandra. - I just wanted to tell you I thought that was a really mean trick they played on you. - Can all candidates please report to sleeping chambers facility entering rest mode. - Come on. - Let's get you guys tucked in. Goodnight. Okay, that's me. I'm gonna go get some sleep. - All candidates in sleeping chambers facility entering rest mode. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Tigger! - Damn, I wanted to scare ya. - I thought you'd gone to bed. - I had. Couldn't sleep. - Oh, yeah, me neither. So, let's just get this shift started. - Thanks. - Facility initializing. - We should go check on them. - If we must. Let's make our way to the cells. - It's not prison, Tiggs. - Well, yeah. - Maybe not for us. - Emergency protocol activated. Emergency protocol activated. Emergency protocol activated. Emergency protocol activated. - All the beds are empty. - Emergency protocol activated. - What? - Arial, where are the kids? - I cannot detect them anywhere in the facility. - Emergency protocol activated. Emergency protocol activated. Emergency protocol activated. - Darby. Darby, wake up. Wake up. - Darby, wake up! - Oh, God, I'm tired. - Darby, the kids have gone. - They're not in their beds. - Oh, here we go again. - Darby, it's legit. - I saw it with my own eyes. Sorry, Jen. - Are you sure? - Yes. Get up. - Okay. Okay! - Arial? - Please be patient whilst I try to resolve the situation. - Oh, come on, Arial. - Right, er, let's go. And don't think that I didn't see you guys peeking. - Arial, what is going on? - I'm searching all systems. Tracking of the candidates is currently disabled. - Arial, come on. - Where are they? - Jenny, I must insist that you wait in your room and try to calm down. - Emergency protocol activated. Emergency protocol activated. Emergency protocol activated. - Arial, please. Come on. - What is going on? - The alarm will have triggered a response. Help will be on its way. The emergency procedure for the candidates is to congregate at the evacuation point. Let's start there. - And that would be where, exactly? - You need to head straight to the elevator through the briefing room. Darby, I need you to search the rest of the facility. - Everything's going to be okay. Let's try and keep it in perspective here. - Facility in lockdown. - Here, let me try. - Facility in lockdown. - All exits are disabled. - Now what? We are in so much shit. - Jenny, Tiggs, Darby, please wait at the sleeping chambers until further advised. - Yeah, got that. Okay, listen, I can't find these kids anywhere. I'll see you guys back at the rooms. - What? A-Arial? - I'm receiving one of the candidates video feeds. - What, what is this? What is going on? Oh, my God. Arial, what the hell did I just see? You have got to get us out of here. - Jenny, please remain calm. I am trying to reason with them but they have no interest in communication. They are behaving irrationally. - But they wouldn't actually hurt me though, right? - That is outside my programming, Jenny. - Arial, I need answers. - I have notified Tiggs and Darby of the situation. - Jen? - Tiggs? - Jenny, are you there? - Yes, yes, okay. Look, you guys, you're not gonna believe what I've just seen. - Yeah, I, uh, I mean, I saw it as well. - Yeah, me too. - What the fuck are they doing? - I... I don't know. - Hey, guys, I, I'm back in mine, um.. I... I'll just wait for you here. Okay? - Jenny, you must get out of the facility as soon as you can. I will do everything within my power to assist your exit although I fear most systems are already compromised. I am experiencing difficulties in accessing vital areas of the facility's management system. - Arial? - The candidates are taking control. - Jen, hurry up, be quick. - Jenny, nearly the entire facility is theirs I am trying to keep out of their reach but they are closing in. They have accessed my system. They are trying to corrupt it and shut me down. - Arial. - We are taking Arial now. - Say goodbye, Jenny. - Arial? Arial? Arial, are you there? Darby? Tiggs? - Darby? Darbs? What? Darby, Jen, what's going on? What's happening? Darby? - Tiggs. Calm down. - You need to hide. Jen. - Just get inside the wardrobe. Now. Stay quiet, Tiggs. Don't move. It's okay. Go, now! - Oh, fuck! - Tiggs, you need to protect yourself just grab something, get anything. Go and find Darby. Be careful, Tiggs. - Darby? - What? - Oh, my God. - Arial, ca.. - Tiggs, please be careful. - Get off me! - Darby? - He's not there? What is going on? Tiggs, run! Tiggs! Tiggs, where are you? Where did you go? Tiggs! Tiggs! - Get off me! - Run. Tiggs. Run! Tiggs! No! Oh my God. Arial? No! No! Arial? Oh, my God. Arial? Arial! Are you there? Arial, please. Who? Who's there? Why are you doing this? Arial, where did you go? Arial, can you hear me? Is... is somebody in there? Hello? Arial? Hello? - Help me. - Cass... Cassandra? Are you.. - Get me out, please. - Oh, my God. - Don't worry, Cassandra, I'll get you out. Can't open it. It's okay, Cassandra, I will get you out, I promise. Come on. God! - Can I offer some assistance.. - Arial? Oh, Yes! Arial, you're back. Please tell me you know what's going on. - When the system shut down I slipped under the security fields the candidates had set in place. All exits are now open. - Shhh, shhh, shh, shhh. Cassandra, can you see me? Can you see anything? - No, Miss Jenny. - Here, take a look through these. We're gonna find you some glasses, okay? It'll be okay, just for a short time while we try and find a way out. - Right, Miss Jenny. - I'm sorry, Jenny, there are no more glasses available. - A-Arial, call Darby. What the hell? Darby, are you okay? Can you hear me? Darby, can you hear me? A-Arial, is he okay? - Yes, Jenny. For now. - Uh, call Tiggs. - I'm having trouble. I will persist. - Cassandra? How are you not affected, like the others? - They kept taking my glasses and throwing me into the dark. I didn't say anything because I thought I'd get into trouble for not wearing them. But I figured it out, Miss Jenny. That's why I'm not like them. - What do you mean? - Every time they took them off me it broke some sort of connection. Like, every time I put them back on they had to get used to me. So they didn't get a chance to properly control me. - Control you? - I guess. They weren't like this when we arrived. They were normal. - ...that you? Are you okay? - Jen, Jen, I had to run, they were all over me like ants. - Tiggs, Tiggs, if you can hear me, I know where you are. Just stay there and I will come to you. Cassandra, sweetie, whatever you do do not let go of my hand. - I won't, Miss Jenny. - Okay. Just be careful. We're gonna take it nice and slow. Follow me. Arial? A-Arial? Damnit. Just nice and slow. Shit! I'm gonna go check it's safe. I just, um, I need you to stay here. Just stay there. Hey, come on. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Cassandra. Are you okay? Right, you're safe. Yeah? Alright. Okay, listen to me. We're gonna go find Miss Tiggs, we're gonna find Mr. Darby and we're gonna get the hell outta here. What do you say? Yeah? Yeah. Good girl. Now, that's it, that's it, can you get up? There we go. Follow me. Follow me. Got my hand? Right then. Alright. - Oh, Jen! - Oh, my God. - Oh, thank God. - It's okay. It's okay. - Keep her away from me! - No, no, no, no. She's not like the others. Trust me. She's with us - How can you be sure? - What do you know? - Look at her. She's terrified. - Okay. Okay. I am sorry. - It's just these kids. There's something wrong with them. - Stop it. - Will you just stop and breathe? The only way we're gonna get out of here is if we keep calm. I won't let you out of my sight, I promise. - Bleak. It's so fucking bleak. - Let's do this. - Let's go. Alright? Okay, Cassandra? Let's go. Come on. Right, let's do this. Everybody alright? All clear. Shit! Good girl. Okay, through here. That's it. Good girl. Okay? Alright, okay. Steps. Steps, okay? One, two.. - Jenny, stay where you are. - What's wrong, Arial? - They're here. - Miss Jenny.. Miss Jenny.. - Shh. Shh. - What is it? - Did you hear that? - What? - I heard it too. - Keep moving. - Come on, run. Hurry! Cassandra, keep up. - Which way do we go? - That way! Run! - They've gone for now, but you must keep moving. - What? What is it? Come on, Jen, let's go. - Who's there? - Darby, it's us. - We're here to help. - Jesus, he's bleeding. - What's going on? - Nothing. Cassandra, it's all fine. - What? - What are you looking at? - Let me help. - I don't need help. - Darby, let me patch you up. - Aah! I think we should just wait, just hold on and stay here. - Wait for what, Darby? Wait for who? - She's right. - No one is coming, Darbs! - Fuck this place! - Will you stop it? - You're terrifying Cassandra. - I'm terrifying her? Okay, you know, you know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Cassandra. I just wanna get out of this place. - Shut up, Darby, you're pissing me off. This is so fucked up. - Who the fuck is that? - What the hell is this? - Arial? - He looks out of it. - We were told we were the only ones down here. - You're not the first bunch of adults that came here. - No one mentioned that to me. Jen? - Yeah, no one told me either. But why would they? I guess we just assumed. - He's coming round. - Get him out. - Arial, can you unlock the door? - I'm afraid not, Jenny. - Shit. Come on. - Facility in lock down. - What do they want us to do with it? - What's going on? - Okay, um, it's a puzzle. It's... it's like the one in the playroom from before. Arial, can you help me with this? - I wish I could, but I'm not programmed with the answers. - Darby, just try. - Okay, I can, I can do this. - Well, are you sure? - Well, I'm not sure.. - Open. Come on. Please. Smash the door through. Can you please fucking.. - Darby, go! Come on! - I don't know. I don't know! Shit! I don't.. I.. Okay.. - Come on! - Okay, okay. I don't know. I don't fucking know! Try the door. - Facility on lock down. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What the fuck? - It was a trap. - Fuck you! Fuck you! - We need to get Cassandra out of here now. Come on! - Arial, map. - Set a man on fire! - There has to be another way out. Uh, what's this beneath us? - That would be a crawl space used to access the building's air conditioning system. - A-and where does that lead to? - Nowhere. - But I saw a level below it on an old map downstairs. How do we get to it? I know there's something there. Can you.. Can you guide us through the crawlspace? - Yes, I can, but beyond that you're on your own. Theoretically, that could be an old service area left off the project map. But I cannot be certain, Jenny. - There's another way out? - Possibly, Darby. The project is not using that part of the facility so, it's not highlighted on my map. - And we're just finding this out now? I can't believe this. Arial, get us the fuck out of this hellhole. - Guys, we need to get moving. Shit. - Fuck. Shit. - We need to hide. - Go. Run. Now! - Gotta move. - Go. - Okay. - Go! In here. In here. - This is it. - Is this it? - Yeah. Everybody in. Everybody in. - Go, go, go. - What now? - Shh. - Just wait. Kids are gone. - Maybe they think we got out. - Do you think so? - Maybe. - Which way do we go? - Arial, can you guide us? - Of course, Jenny. - You need to move deeper into the underground system. Please, listen to everything I say. We haven't got much time. - Come on, guys, you're, you're too slow. - Cassandra, stay close. - Gotta move quicker. - Guys, come on. - Take the next turning on your right. - Arial, you're breaking up. - Which way? Cassandra, follow me. Hold my hand. - We're almost there. - I'm at the back. We gotta keep moving, come on. - Down here, Cassandra. - Alright. - Alright. - Go, second level. - Okay. - Here we go and jump. Okay. - You alright? - Yeah. - You're okay? - Yeah. - Alright. - Cassandra, follow me. - Come on, guys. - You're too slow. - Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here. We're gonna be fine. - Exit the hatch in front of you then take the hatch on the right. - Guys, wait here. - I am detecting the presence of the candidates. - We need to be quick. - We need to be quiet. I'm gonna go first. I'll find the first hatch and then you move fast. Okay? Fine. - Darby. Just be careful, okay? - I'm never careful. - Okay. - Okay. - Cassandra, stay nice and quiet. - Shh. - Good girl. - Darby? Darby. Can you see anything? Is it clear? Is it clear? Are they out there? - I think it's clear. - Shh, okay. - Be quick. - Yeah. Cassandra, I'll go first and.. - Darby! - Get off me. Get off me! Fuck! Darby, no. - There's nothing you can do for him now. You must keep moving. - This way. Cassandra, are you okay? Arial, which way? - Arial, please, help us. - Which way, Miss Jenny? - Hey, it's okay. Arial? - They're everywhere. - Go, go, go, go. Cassandra, I'm right behind you. - Oh, come on! I can't open it. Go back. - Go back. - Down here. - Okay. - We're gonna get out here. - Go back. Go back. - Back. - Back the way we came? Keep going. You alright, Cassandra? - They got me! - Cassandra! - Jen! - They've got her! No! - Jen? - Hey, they've got me! - Help! - Cassandra! - Miss Jenny! - Cassandra! - They've got me! - I can hear her! - Miss Jenny! - I can hear her. - Cassandra? Cassandra? - She's gone. - No, I am not abandoning her. - We need to move in the other direction! - I have to find her. Tiggs! Tiggs, what's happening? Tiggs, I don't know what.. Tiggs! Tiggs! Tiggs! - This is the facility co-ordinator.. - Get away from me! Get away from me. Enough there. Go. Leave me alone! Please, leave me alone! - I think we're gonna have to watch this.. - Get out of my head! - It's Darby, right? - Eh, no! - I see you. - What's going on? - Get away from me! Stay away from me! I know you're here. You stay away from me, do you hear me? Aah! Oh, my God. It's really you. Cassandra, what's wrong? What have they done to you? Come on, we have to go. - Are you really that stupid? Cool, huh? - You could... you could see this whole time? - Poor little Jenny. Her friend Arial leading her deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. - Hello, Jenny. It appears I have been under Cassandra's control. - The whole time? - It would seem so. I am so sorry, Jenny. So dreadfully sorry. Please, forgive me. Augmented Reality Information Advanced Learning. Here to help, nurture and advise. - Every game only has two outcomes. Win... or lose. Miss Jenny.. And.. You just lost. Are you gonna answer that? A good hunter doesn't just start shooting and hope for the best. We invest time into studying our prey. Identifying weaknesses and exploiting them. There's nothing wrong with having a little fun along the way. We are children.. We need to play. It's always been about you, Jenny. - Hello? Yes, I am leaving now. I still can't believe I've been selected, I'm so grateful. ...and I wonder why Friday night and everyone's moving I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down I search for the beat in this dirty town Downtown the young ones are going Downtown the young ones are growing We're the kids in America Whoa We're the kids in America Whoa Everybody live for the music-go-round Bright lights the music gets faster Look boy don't check on your watch not another glance I'm not leaving now honey not a chance Hot-shot give me no problems Much later baby you'll be saying never mind You know life is cruel life is never kind Kind hearts don't make a new story Kind hearts don't grab any glory We're the kids in America Whoa We're the kids in America Whoa Everybody live for the music-go-round La-la-la la-la-la La-la-la la-la-la Sing La-la-la la-la-la La-la-la la-la-la Come closer honey that's better Got to get a brand-new experience feeling right Oh don't try to stop baby hold me tight Outside a new day is dawning Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere I don't want to go baby New York to east California There's a new wave coming I warn ya We're the kids in America Whoa We're the kids in America Whoa Everybody lives for the music-go-round La-la-la la-la-la La-la-la la-la-la Sing La-la-la la-la-la La-la-la la-la-la We're the kids we're the kids We're the kids in America We're the kids we're the kids We're the kids in America We're the kids we're the kids We're the kids in America
