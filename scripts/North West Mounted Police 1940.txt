Here, for two centuries these half-breed hunters and trappers multiplied and prospered a law unto themselves. Then surveyors and homebuilders pushed westward bringing laws of land and property which threatened to end forever the free ways of the wild trails. ln 1885, resentful and confused, the half-breeds, under the leadership of Louis Riel, revolted against the advance of unwelcome law. ln that hour, a handful of hard riding men in scarlet coats, the Northwest Mounted Police, stood between Canada's destiny and the rebellion that was being kindled across the American border in a little Montana school house. Three cheers for the red, white and blue. Three cheers for the red, white and blue. Three cheers for the red, white and blue. Thy banners make tyranny tremble. Three cheers for the red, white and blue. Three cheers for the red, white and blue. Three cheers for the red, white and blue. Thy banners make tyranny tremble. Three cheers for the red, white and blue. Susie, you didn't sing the last words. l got scared, Mr. Riel. He kind of looks like the big bad robber in the picture books. l'm going to let you all go home early today children. - School dismissed! - Bye, Mr. Riel! Susie! Come here. There's nothing to frighten you. These are old friends from Canada. Get the kid out! Time is short. -Run along. Don't imagine things. -Alright. l'll sing good tomorrow. You're not gonna be here tomorrow. l got your message, Duroc. Returning to Canada is death. For some maybe, not for us. 15 years of exile haven't changed you Corbeau. Or you... l hope. Canada change plenty. No more she belong to the half-breed. The law come on the old trails, white people steal the land, the surveyor tell us where we got to live. We send plenty letter to government. She is too busy to listen. Government take care of lndians, take care of white settler. Ain't nobody take care of the half-breed people. No half-breed gonna take care of himself. She's gonna fight by Jove. You gotta come back, and lead us. -Against the Queen's soldiers? -Yes. -We tried that once. -This time it will be different. The lndians are in grand council. More Black Feet and Cree than anybody ever saw before. They'll join us if l say so, and fight. l got Cree blood, same as Big Bear. -The lndian government... -What? You and me, and Duroc, we will be the government. With the lndians, we'll wipe the whites out of Western Canada. We'll set up a new government. Batoche gonna be our capital. Half-breeds coming there by hundreds from the river and woods,... -They still believe in me... -Yeah. You know what happens if we fail again? We don't fail! Corbeau's got something. You've never seen a gun like that. She squirt lead like a hurricane. Trust Corbeau to know the newest way of killing. -My gun shoots 1000 slugs a minute. -lmpossible. A Gatling gun stole near the border. -Blood. -Put on the dunce cap. -l go fight alone. Come on! -No! l will never let you lead my people. You can be the saint that leads them Louis. All l want is the whiskey business. And l'll get it. Or you'll get no help from the lndians. l don't want no help from a whiskey trader. -You...! -Corbeau! Louis, if he don't get the Cree and Black Feet to fight those redcoats with us, we go smash. And the half-breeds, they don't fight without Louis. So maybe you don't like each other but you need each other very much. Blood will run like water. Blood? You won't notice it much. The mounted police wear red coats. Looks like bargain day in Batoche. Trouble... Keep your eyes open and holster closed. Left turn! Present arms! Present the arms! Soldier, what for you don't do what l say? l go home. Duroc, he's a go home. Hey! Why you go home? ''Shoulder arm, hold arm, right, left, right about,...'' He change his mind too much. l go home. Go home? Get back. All you men obey the order. -Come here! -Red coats! Johnny Pelang, dismiss the men. Get the paper. -Good boy. -Shoulder the arms! Redcoats coming, we dismiss now. Go away, but don't leave. You suppose the inspector's right and Riel is back? The inspector's always right. -The fort's 20 miles away. -Dry up. -Where did they get those revolvers? -Santa Claus. The police. Cover up quick. Hello, Freddie Monts. Pretty heavy lunch box you got there. She's just a little present for my wife. Be careful she's not your widow. -Brave man to give his wife bullets. -Stow that. There are men here all the way from the Parsnip. They mean business. Fort Carlton tonight, same place. Ronnie. l told you to forget that klootch. She's poison. -But Jim l... -Never trust a blue eyed squaw. There's the old wolf himself. Go to hospital and call on your sister. Stay there until l come. -Don't come on a stretcher. -Sharp now. -Hello, Jim. -Hello, Dan. Quite a crowd. Sure. Plenty friends of mine. -ls Louis Riel here yet? -He is the best friend we got. Better advise him to go slow. For 15 years we go slow. Now we go quick. We give you 24 hours. On this paper we write what we want. lf your government say no, we make new government. You're making a mistake. -The law is in the Northwest now. -So is this fellow. You can't fight the whole British empire? 50 mounted police, only 50. ln all Canada, only 500. We got many thousand half-breed. Big Bear and Crow foot got 10,000 warrior. The lndians won't follow Riel. Maybe they follow Jacques Corbeau. lf you bring back that killer you'll deserve what you get. You're a great old wolf, Duroc. l'd hate to see you hang with that coyote. -24 hour Jim, we want answer. -You'll get it, if the wires to Ottawa stay up. The wires, she'll stay up. Just 24 hours. Don't get them tangled around your neck. -You think Corbeau no come, eh? -He will if he smells blood. Maybe he smell blood pretty quick. Your blood! Pull him down! We're gonna fight! lf we want Corbeau, we'll be getting Corbeau. The redcoat be skinned pretty easy. lf we want Riel, we'll get Riel! -Didn't Jim ask you to stay here? -Yes but... Take your hand off that bridle! Stand clear. Let go of that bridle! Shorty! lt's a boy! A boy Shorty! Don't you want to see your son? A boy! Hang loose! Out of the way! My son he ask for see me. Good for him! Tod McDuff! l just have baby! Remarkable. -Hello, Tod. -Hey, Jim. Thanks for keeping Shorty covered, but l'm glad you didn't shoot. l was of a mind too but l was afraid l'd drop a stitch. She not very big. How you make sure that's boy? Black Chief. That's chief. Look, Jim. l just got baby boy! That's a fine papoose. l've got to tell my wife about this. -Hello, April. -Hi. l'll have to get Shorty's baby a rattle for that timing. The baby arrived hours ago. -Then you get the rattle. -You rattle me enough as it is. Hold still Niska. Roll up my sleeve Ekawe. l will. How can you deliver a baby, set a broken leg and look lovelier than a Christmas calendar all at once? You're quite a picture yourself, you'd look good in a golf frame. -Better in the same frame. -Let's make it a family album. Let's water the horses. We must get Duroc's message on the wire. Right. When you look at Ronnie even his hair stands to attention. There's a contrary streak in the Logan breed. -We just know our own minds. -You don't know your own heart? -l don't intent to listen to it. -You will. You're leg will be just as straight as sergeant Bret's back. -Tell you what our plans are... -Jim! l've been transferred to Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia? What's that's where codfish grow, isn't it? Orders are orders in my branch of the service too. Niska! You mustn't eat that. Your tummy will turn to stone. Like your heart. -l just don't understand. -You'll never understand Jim. Until something beats you to your knees. Don't get yourself all over plastered. -You love me. -You see? You don't ask. You just make statements. Well, do you love me? l might but l don't want to. Help me, will you? You're fine and right for yourself and for the service but -anyway, l'm leaving. -Running away? -l'm no heroine. -All Anglican nurses are heroines. l don't want to be bravely smiling goodbye to my husband every time he puts down a rebellion or goes on patrol to the North Pole. l just wouldn't let him. When do you leave? -Next month. -We'll see. Anything in the regulations about you always getting your woman? No, but there should be. l gave the horses some water. Have some yourself. l'll be there in a minute. l wish you'd think what it means to us if you leave. l'll have plenty of time to think in Nova Scotia. Sure. What's time to a codfish? But l'll track you. To Nova Scotia, Afghanistan... or anywhere, because l still think we belong in the same frame. Niska, do you think l'm a fool? So do l. You'll make somebody a good wife someday. ln the meantime we'll need you as a Mounted Police scout. Duroc is my very good friend. Nearly every night for 30 years we've played pinnacle together. You can't be on both sides. McDuff, you don't scout for the Redcoats? -You don't turn against me. -My father was a Highlander. They helped knit the Empire together and l'll have no hand in unraveling it. The inspector will swear you in at Fort Carlton in the morning Tod. 24 hours Jim. You and me, like brothers Tod. Aye, that we are. But l cannot fight against the Queen. Flesh of the snake. Blood of the skunk! You don't fight with us, maybe you don't fight with nobody. lt would twist my soul to fight against you Dan. But l cannot fight against the Queen. -Jerry. -Yes? Cover up for me after mess. l've gotta get out. Next time tell that klootch to bring a friend. Ottawa can't possibly act on these demands in 24 hours. B0 atoche will boil over and scald half of Canada. Rotten business. lf the lndians rise they'll be blood from here to Baffin Bay. Come on! Gates closing for the night! Everybody out. Civilians outside the stockade! Get going, Uncle Blue Owl. -Come on. Come on. -Hurry it up there. Hurry it up. -Where can l find the head man? -Headquarters over there. Keep moving. Everyone out. Hey you! Who's that? Gabriel? No civilians allowed in the stockade after retreat, mister. -You'll have to come back tomorrow. -Thanks. Hold him for me, will you soldier? He's part bull and don't like red. A man from Texas, sir. My name's Dusty Rivers sir, Texas Rangers. l landed up here following a man we're after for murder. Orderly, tell sergeant Bret l want him. Yes, sir. Ranger's commission. Commissioner's deputy, United States Marshal and here's my O. K. from your Regina office. -l've heard of your organization. -Thanks. We heard of yours too. Thank you. You come at rather a difficult time. Sergeant Bret, this is Mr. Rivers of the Texas Rangers. Howdy. Texas did you say? -Texas, is a United State. -Yes, sir. The Rangers are a organization rather like our own in some respects. Yes, sir. He's here on a police errand. See that he's fed, billeted, and offered a bath. Then help him fill out the proper forms. Very good, sir. That's mighty hospitable of you but l want to get started... This way please. They say Riel is gonna try it again. Look out, l'm not Riel. l tried a lot of times l never got anywhere. -Low bridge there Slim. -Place wasn't built for a giraffe. Gentlemen! This is Mr. Rivers of the Texas constabulary. -Rangers. -Hello, constable! Another criminal has leaked out of the US and he's after him. You can sleep in that collapsible mantrap, sheriff. Attention, to roll call. -Constable Ackroyd. -Here. -Adams. -Cameron. -Douglass. -Fyffe. -Herrick. -Judson. -Kent. -Kennedy. -On patrol. -Harder than rock but for your head. -Lane. -Logan. Logan? He was slightly overheated and went out to get some air. Ronnie! -Why you be so late? -l was put on potato patrol. lf this potato is other woman... l eat your heart out. l was pealing one million potatoes just because l talked to you in Batoche. Then maybe l don't eat your heart. l just keep him here, inside my heart. Suits me molasses. -Here. Want this for a padlock? -Ronnie! This lock both our hearts together. Put it on for me please. What's that? Get! lf that wicked sentry finds you your cute little pelt will be nailed to the barn door. Ronnie, maybe police no let me come Fort no more. -Why? -My father, he come back. Who's your father? He's very bad medicine. l remember long ago he cooked bear meat on stick give me piece in my hand. Well l'll tell you what we'll do. l won't bite him if he doesn't bite me. Please, you don't let my father bust us up! Listen you little wild cat. You're the only real thing for me. Nobody, nothing could ever make me let you go. l love you so terrible bad l feel good. l'll be pealing potatoes the rest of my life for this. -Douglass, a hand will you? -Of course. Mother and child, both doing nicely. What do you ride in Texas? Elephants? They come in handy if you break a wheel on your wagon. An uncle of mine visited Texas once. Sir William Wade, perhaps you've met him. We hung a fellow named Bill Wade. That probably was not Sir William. No! Advise me what time Logan get in. Good night Sheriff. Revelly is at six o'clock. -Re- what? -Oh Revelly. You fellows are pretty fancy! Having ltalian food for breakfast. Doesn't your organization rise by bugle call? Sure! We blow Rev... Oh! You mean Revelry. lt's been waking him up every morning and he can't pronounce it. Any more than you can eat it. We'll get your man for you. l was counting on being home by the 4th of July. -Your birthday? -No, my Uncle Sam's. lt's an American holiday. Yeah. The States sort of set up housekeeping for themselves. After being hatched and protected for 150 years. -Don't mind him. He reads a lot. -We stuck to our mother, that's all. lt's a wise child that knows its own mother. A wiser one that appreciates her. Good night Sheriff. Good night. But l still want to be home by the 4th of July. Have your saddles ready for marching orders in the morning. There may be action. -Lights out. Good night. -Good night. Action tomorrow. You hear that? Look, he's a Redcoat at heart. ls that the Rangers full dress? Undress. Very good! Why do you carry two guns? One don't shoot far enough. -l'd like to visit Texas some day. -You can. Canadians get over to our country too once in a while. l'm after one of 'em now. -Good night. -Good night. Good night. That second red river cart looks like it had the mumps. Wait. l'll talk to them. -Good afternoon. -How do you do? What's in the carts? -Take a look. lf you want. -No, you have no warrant. These aren't ordinary times, mister. Rare wheels for a red river cart. Open it up! Come along! Pull the hide off. Holy cat! Look at this! Why did you do that? We could have taken them prisoner. There was no need to shed blood. You're splattered with it too, Louis. You can't back out now. Get going! Advance! Get up there! Come on! -Well? -No word yet sir. Fur! Buy from me please. -You buy these white ermines? -No! Buy from me please. Furs. You buy these pretty white ermines? What l got here is very fine, very young. What you got is the oldest thing there is, only the original sale was for an apple not a fur. l no sell this for apple. Stranger! l wouldn't buy any furs from that Beelzebub! -She steals them! -You tell lie! Somagun Scotch lndian! -l think l kill you. -Heathen. l'll take you across my knee and tan your hide. -l kill you! -Oh you would! Let go my hair! Let go! l'll get you for this! -l'll skin you for this! -You're gonna get it! Let me go! Take her hands off her or l'll beat your teeth out! Logan! Tod, report to the OC. He'll swear you in. Aye Him. Daughter of Beelzabub, l know how to handle a woman. l told you to keep away from this fort. Pretty soon you'll no be boss no more. Get out of here! Wait a minute! Where did you get that ring? What you care? Logan, l want to talk to you. l warned you about that klootch. -My personal business is my own. -She's a thieving little... l ought to wipe your jaw for that. Don't be a fool. -lt's because she's part lndian. -No! Because she's all bad. You'd lose your eyebrows if l married her, wouldn't you? -Why? -Why not? -l don't see why all this... -Do you know who she is? -l know who she's going to be. -She's Jacques Corbeau's daughter. Look out! lt's April! What happened? Call the hospital orderlies. Get the doctor! Put that man out there. Take this one first. He's dead. -Corporal take charge of the body. -Dr. Roberts. This way sir! -There's two of them in there. -Gently, he's badly hurt. -Who is it? -l don't know! Corporal! Clear these people. -Come on! -Let Miss Logan through! How'd it happen? Constable Fenton. -Where did you find him? -On the Red Berry trail. l was on my way to a case. How long were they lying there before you found them? -lt happened just before l got there. -Did you hear firing? -Did you see any tracks? -Some red river cart tracks. l couldn't tell how many horses. -What Fenton able to say anything? -He said something about a gun but... Constable Fenton, what happened? Wagon train, sir... Carrying a... Gatling gun. -A Gatling gun? -Somebody running guns to Duroc. -Did you recognize the men? -No, sir. But funny foreign looking saddle. Fenton, can you describe the saddle? Did it have a big silver horn? Biggest l ever saw. What the boy saw was a Mexican charro saddle. Probably ridden by the man l'm after, Jacques Corbeau. Corbeau? Have the bugle sound boots and saddles. -Patrol of 20 men. -Yes, sir. Good job Miss Logan. Better stay at the fort. Batoche is not safe. Thank you but l have several patients in my hospital. l wish l was one of them... -Boots and saddles! -Come on! No member of the force shall discuss the situation with any civilian, except in being in the regular line of duty. Alright. Bedrolls and kit bags on the wagons at once! Don't let the grass grow under you. Come on! On the double. Get 'em out there. Pick 'em up. They won't bite. Be sure you put that on the horse Logan. -One keg of horseshoes. -Right. Don't forget the nails this time. You can't sew them on. -Right. -And an extra wagon pole. -That breaks you'll pull it yourself. -Right. One coil of rope. You boys can sure slap a saddle on pronto. Come on! On the double! Fresh team for you Miss. lnspector's orders. -Thanks. l can hitch them. -lf you say so ma'am. Fall in! -l'll hook 'em up for you Miss. -Thank you. Back up here you lucky horse. lt belongs to the Mounted Police. -They're pretty good, aren't they? -They're the best. -My name's Dusty Rivers. -lsn't that a contradiction? l expect you've never been to Texas, Miss... -Miss...? -April Logan. -April? You're not fooling? -No. Here's your horse, sergeant. Head 'em out. Group mount! Reform ranks! Eyes right! Eyes front! At ease! Make much of your horses! April, l'd rather you didn't go back to the town. Sergeant, what part of the parade do l ride in? l'm sorry, you're not going with us. -April, with Riel on the warpath. -l'm sorry too, -but l am going with you. -Corbeau is wanted for murder here. He belongs to the Mounted Police now. He belongs to whoever catches him first. Hi, sis'! Let your brother kiss you goodbye. ln the line Logan. l'll be glad to tend to any unfinished chores for you. There are some things about you that l don't like. -You're not exactly perfection. -This isn't Texas... Jim! l think l'm capable of deciding who l'll kiss goodbye. l'm not sure that you are. -You ought to obey him. -Do you? -Not always. -Your judgment's good enough for me. -Patrol all present, sergeant. -Very good. -Patrol ready to march, sir. -Pick up the trail at the scene. lt'll probably take you to Big Bear's camp. -Yes sir. March them off. -Very good sir. March! March! Sections right! Right! Wire from Headquarters, sir. Sergeant Bret! Patrol halt! -Dismiss you men, sergeant. -Beg your pardon, sir? -Dismiss your men. -Very good, sir. -Sergeant Field, take over! -What the.. Dismiss the patrol. Sections left about! -What's up? -We're staying here. Not me, amigo. l'm gonna get Corbeau. lf you ride through that gate l'll place you under arrest. -You can try. -Sergeant! lnspector's complements: Will you, Mr. Rivers and McDuff report at once. Change of orders from Regina. No patrols to leave until we're reinforced by Colonel lrvine. lt'll take a week. By then Corbeau will have Big Bear on the warpath. And the Black feet. -Couldn't you wire Regina? -No! The wires were cut two minutes after this came through. Does the order prohibit sending out a single scout? No. l'd like your permission to proceed to Big Bear's camp alone -and try to keep him loyal. -No! Only a loon would do it. lt's a ticklish job, but permission is granted. l'll leave at once, sir. l'll leave at the same time. l'd be grateful if you'd bind and gag this Texan. -l'm not going where he is. -Where do you want to go? l figured to pick up Corbeau in Batoche. -Why do you think he's there? -That's Riel's capital, isn't it? You can't make an arrest in Canada. lf l got to have a nurse... give me the Scotchman. McDuff, you'll accompany Mr. Rivers. And gentlemen l hope you keep your scalps. A nurse, at my time of life... -Good hunting. -Thanks. -Sure you make that fast. -Alright miss. Climb aboard McDuff. -Where are you going? -Batoche. -l wish it was 1000 miles. -Seat's too hard for 20 miles. Lady, to me it's just like sitting on a cloud. Get! -Are you riding with us Jim? -No. The other way. l'll send you a postcard. Canada is a lot different from what l expected. The scenery? -No, the people. -Haven't had much time to tell. Sometimes it strikes you at first sight... l mean... You can usually figure a man by the way he handles his horse but women are different. What did you expect Canadian women to be like? Like the scenery: good to look at but kind of frostbitten. But you're not. l've always understood Americans were too busy building, and selling and shooting each other to waste time saying nice things to women. -We get around to it now and then. -Must be appreciated by your wife. -Who's wife? -Aren't you married? l've always held that a bachelor is a fellow who never makes the same mistake once. You believe that? l did... until mighty recent. Do you think a plant from up here would do alright in Texas? l don't know Texas. Even the moonlight's warm and soft along the Pecos River. Do you have fast horses in Texas Mr. Rivers? The fastest in the world. Betting they cannot keep up with the men? Look! -What happened, Mrs. Burns? -Don't go into Batoche. -They've looted the Trading Post. -And driven us from our homes. -How could Duroc permit it? -He tried to keep order but... when Corbeau got there... -Corbeau? -Yes. Excuse me, lady. Enough! Just one thing more. Riel can tell you how this new government sets up. But l'll tell you how it's going to win. 10,000 lndians turn loose on Saskatchewan. They'll be nobody left to pull down this government when l'm finished. Canadian woman who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, who has so sweet the eyes, Gentlemen, Corbeau has promised you the backing of Big Bear. When Big Bear leads the Cree nation upon the war path the Black Feet will rise with him. Our fire of wrath will consume its oppressors. From it will arise, not half-breed, but a free and independent Metis nation. Don't mind me, mister. Go right ahead. Duroc, who is he? He's officer from United States. Want talk with Canada Government. l bring him here. They found out quick. Hey! l'm a Deputy US Marshal, Mr. Riel -And... -You know my name. Sure! Who don't? Here's my credentials. We'd be happy to know if your new government means to work hand in hand with the United States. The Metis of Canada will be happy to cooperate with the USA. Suppose some fellow commits a crime in our country then trails up here to hide out. We'll help you in every way just as we hope you will help us. That's fine because l got a warrant here for the arrest of a man named Jacques Corbeau. On a charge of murder. Gentlemen! Council is recessed. Wait here. That put a bee in Riel's bonnet. -This bee on your bonnet. -What's the matter with it? -My first bullet shoots him off. -Why you wanna ruin my bonnet? Just so you know it is me who fires the second shot. The one that go between your eye. l'll make you a small wager. 50 cents that l put a bullet through your vengeful heart before you shoot the knob from my bonnet. l take that bet and l take the money from your pocket because you'll be dead. Corbeau. -There's a US officer here. -For what? -You. -Well? He wants a warrant from my government for your arrest. -Why don't you give it to him? -But we need you for the lndians. ln two hours give him your warrant. Tell him l'm in Big Bear's camp. He can arrest me there. He would never leave that camp alive. You don't want him killed here, do you Louis? At an lndian camp, who cares? Once the Cree warriors were free men. Canada belonged to you and to us. Well it's gonna be ours again. Take the warpath with us. Fight! Fight like you used to fight, and not one of these prairie cops will be buried with his scalp on. Big Bear, that medal you wear is the Queen's. The great white mother who sent food to you when you starved. You're too wise to let a liar make bad blood between us. Men say Queen no longer rule us. Redcoat no more our friend. This is our friend that bites with a thousand teeth of fire. Make gun talk to them. -lt'll tear it to rags. -Squaw make new lodge. A hole in the tent won't change the British Empire. This man is going to hang. l don't want to see you beside him. Make gun talk. Two more strangers. l want his scalp. l know him. Well you sure found Corbeau alright. You're as welcome as a broken leg. Ahkakito, who these men? Spies to count your men and horses. His tongue is forked. He said he came alone. This man is no spy. He comes from afar to take Corbeau who killed in his nation. Like Mounted Police want Corbeau because he has killed here. Are you afraid of Redcoats? Their blood spills like other men's. Look here Chief. Before you turn that man over to the Mounted Police, l got an order for his arrest not only from the US, but from his own Chief, Riel. And if you... l'm paid 72 cents a day to protect dummies like him. Peace. We got no war with the Redcoat. Yet. But they no take away my friend. You both come alone, you both go alone. l have spoken. Big Bear was a great chief. His friends will be sorry for him. Now you die. You can kill me and take this back but its medicine will be gone. The great white mother gave you this to let you rule over thousands. You are not chief unless she gives it back to you. Big Bear will join his blood brother and fight for Riel. Go. Big Bear, you're a great Chief. Why we heard of you way down in Texas. But how do you know who's the best fighter? The Mounted Police or Corbeau, the great killer of men? -You better get out. -Rivers. Peace. Talk. Why this fellow's killed in Texas, and killed in Canada. He must be a great gunfighter, but have you ever seen him kill? How do you know all these yarns are true? l'll show you if they're true. He offers to show you. Let him kill now. Who he kill? Me. Another will die. Slide my guns back in their cradles, untie my hands and l'll hold them out. Then tell this tough man to go to it. Cut the thongs. Put back the guns. -The man is daft. -He's great! Now tell him to kill. Kill. Go ahead Corbeau. Draw. Tell him to draw Big Bear. He's been bragging about how he's gonna kill? Start on me. Kill. Draw you yellow pole cat! You're a good hand at shooting men in the back. What's wrong now?. l won't foul a great Chief's lodge with the blood of a dog. He's yapping across the trail, to save his Redcoat friends. But the medicine gun, she'll roll them all in the dirt. l have not seen this yet. Then look. What a thing! That gun strong medicine. Shooting painted horses is not killing men. Before the sun has set three times l'll bring you the Redcoats of the Mounted Police, made redder with their own blood and full of holes like a net. You're not a feather to be blown about by the talk of a coward. Bring me in your hand their empty coat red with blood before three suns have set and my braves will take the warpath. Before three suns have set Corbeau will wear iron on his hands. Come on! Very nice entertainment indeed. Now if you'll cut me loose l'll endeavor to show my appreciation. You're alright, Sheriff. Let's mush. -l came here to get that fellow. -l think we'd better move before Corbeau finds out the lndians took the bullets out of your pistols. l won't tell on you. Come on. Whatever you did at Big Bear's camp these men have undone. What else could we do? Our horses were stolen two nights ago. You should have blown it up! Leaving 10,000 rounds of ammunition at Duck Lake is inexcusable. When my wife heard the half-breeds were coming through Duck Lake on their way to attack Prince Albert, she grabbed the kid and we left. Thank you. That's all. l didn't think about saving anything but our scalps. -We're going after that ammunition. -Very good, sir. But Col. lrvine's relief force is due shortly. Relief or not, we cannot allow that ammo to fall into Riel's hand. -l don't like the smell of this. -What do you mean? l'm curious to learn where Corbeau plans to find the bullet ridden red coats he promised Big Bear. That won't be his first lie. Sergeant. You will post sentries commanding Beardy's Basin. That's the only place we could be ambushed this side of Duck Lake. There's an old cabin there? That's the cabin. See that Basin below you? lf Riel's brigade cuts back from the Prince Albert road they'll come through the river bed there. Each man two hours on watch, two hours rest. Two hours on your feet, and two hours on your back. At the first sign of the enemy fall back at gallop and report. -All this time the half breed army... -Moving in the other direction. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. You'll be relieved tomorrow. Bye. Keep your eyes open. Same to you. Ekawe! You fix leg. Come sit in this nice green chair. Does the cast hurt you? No, you help her good that's why l help you. -Help me? How?. -You fix. Don't look at me. Redcoat march for Duck Lake. Half-breed, they wait in wood, kill Redcoat. But l thought Riel had marched on Prince Albert. That's just for trick. They make trap for Redcoat at Duck Lake. An ambush? With the medicine gun? Yes. Your brother keep watch on cabin at Beardy's basin. They gonna kill him tonight. So he don't see them make what you call ambush. Ronnie! Ronnie? You just trying to scare me. l don't like you pretty much. But it's Ronnie who's in danger. -You think l like him too much? -lf you like him, you can help him. What do you mean, like? l love Ronnie. That's why you no like me. You think l'm no good for him. lf you love him, you'll do as l ask. He's on outpost duty at the old cabin near Beardy's Basin. Go to him. Tell him to warn the Police not to march on Duck Lake. -Why don't you go? -They won't let me leave Batoche. Nobody would stop you. What you think? Me save police? Pretty soon my father have all the whiskey business and l wear silk and rings. l think Ronnie like that. lf you don't warn the Police, Ronnie will hate you. Maybe that man you love, that big sergeant gonna be killed. Maybe bullet go through that Scotch lndian. -Louvette. -Somofagum, you think you better than me, you go save them. l'm not better than you. lf you want rings, l'll give them to you. But don't lose anymore time. l beg you on my knees if that will make you go. Soon medicine gun knock police on their knees. Maybe tomorrow night the wolf come for what is left. You say you love Ronnie while you brazenly sit there eating, knowing he's gonna be killed. There's nothing in you but hate. You're a savage Louvette. A vicious, cruel savage. Blood and revenge is all you know, -not love. -Hey you! l'll show you love. What you want l tell Ronnie? You'll go? Sure l go. Tell Ronnie the half breeds will ambush at Beardy's Basin. Sure l tell him. You go home now. We'll never forget what you've done for us. No. You won't forget. -What's after you? -A big bad rabbit. Chased me all the way back. -Male or female? -l didn't ask. My tobacco is in the saddle bag. -Steal it sparingly. -Thank you. l will. You need wife for clean the house. What in the... What are you doing here? -How'd you know l was here? -My father is mad on me. -Why? -He find out l got big love for you. Why didn't you tell me Corbeau was your father? Tonight he take plenty half breed made big ride to Prince Albert. -But when he come back... -Answer me... What do you care who is my father? You hate Jacques Corbeau more strong than you love Louvette. l'd be bat brained about you if your father was the devil himself. You don't never marry with me now. Once this is over l'll marry you quicker than you can say Somagum. That's too late. Why? My father gonna kill me 'cause l love Redcoat. We be married tonight or we don't be married never. Tonight? lndians shoot priest at Frog Lake today. Now at Batoche, Duroc he's scared for Father Piccard. Gonna send him to Regina when daylight come. Please, he marry us before he go. -But l can't leave here. -Nothing happen here. Why you here for anyway? Orders. But you be back before somebody know. Somofagum. l love you so terrible much. But l'm on duty. They'd hang me, shoot me, boil me in oil. You don't love me because who my father is. Try to understand. l have to watch the river bed. That other fellow could watch. Get in river bed with him. lf your neck wasn't so lovely l'd break it. You break the heart. -Always l know you lie to me. -No! But that lie is sweet and my heart, she sing like a bird. l don't live without you, Ronnie. You crazy little loon. What do you think you'll do? -l'm going. -No, you won't. You're the sweetest poison that ever got in a man's blood. l love you. l want you. We'll be in Batoche in one hour. Maybe less. Ten minutes with the priest. An hour to get back here. Ronnie! l'll leave word for Jerry he'll have to take15 minutes of my guard. He'll yell, but he's a good egg. Ronnie! Ronnie, they're coming. Wake up, Ronnie. Get back to the fort! The half-breeds ride. Warn the force! Ambush... -What happened to this town? -They all go Prince Albert to fight for Louis Riel. We wait in here for Father Piccard. lt's dark as a weasel's bedroom. Louvette! The rifle! Quick, Louvette! The gun! You don't need gun now, Ronnie. Tie him here. You crawling black scum! -Shut up. -Don't you hit him. -Get out. Get out. -Pay now. Get out. Get out. Well, come on. -Cut me loose. -l got to keep you here. lf l don't you be killed like the others. You sneaking shewolf. Killed? Like what others? ln Duck Lake woods 1,000 half breed make trap for Redcoat. The whole force will be cut to pieces. -Every man of them. -Yeah. But you're alive is all l care. You, dirty squaw. Why didn't you tell me? l'll kill you when l get loose. When you be safe you kill me all you want. Back to the column. Warn them the outpost's been killed. Danger of enemy on all sides. Gallop. You'd better get back with the column. Thanks. That blue eyed klootch has got him. -That's destroying evidence. -Which might put that boy in front of a firing squad. lf the whole column rides into a death trap he'll deserve whatever he gets. l was thinking of his sister. Do you think it'll help to make her pay for his mistakes? Somebody's paying for it right now. Sound commence firing. Take what cover you can find! -Turn the wagons over for barricades! -Yes, sir! Bring those wagons forward! Steady men! -Load! -That gun! She speak death like the rattling snake. Yes. She'll get me them red coats for Big Bear. Now that side! Sergeant Bret and that Texan are coming through. -Give them fire cover! -Yes, sir. Clear there... -Help the Sergeant. -He's alright. You got nine lives, Sergeant. Have a spill bud? No, thanks, just had one. Keep your heads covered men. Still got one good arm Bill, use it. Take your time! Don't waste a shot! -Look at that hat. 20 bucks. -Wear a feather. Get us out of this crossfire. Fall back on Carlton. Yes, sir. Palmer, Rankin, root out that snipers nest to the rear. -Right that wagon for the wounded. -Right. First section, open the Carlton road. Sections on the right, fall back 50 yards. Left sections hold fast. Bugler, sound retire and continue firing. Pick up all rifles. Don't leave any ammunition. Give me 10 men and l'll hold the road while you drop back. You drop back with the men. l'll hold the road. l can't hear you. Louvette. Let me go to them. l'll do anything. l'll give you anything. No, Ronnie. l don't let you be killed. Doctor! -We're back at Fort Carlton. -How many got back? -We don't know yet, sir. -Many? No, sir. They were in the woods thicker than boiled beans on Tuesday. But we couldn't see them. Jerry was on outpost. Why didn't he warn us? Jerry's dead. They must have got Logan when they got Jerry. Nobody got Logan. He went over the hill. -l heard the Sergeant. -Look out! Ronnie didn't seem to be that kind of a chap. lf Ronnie had the slugs in his legs l've got in mine he couldn't have run so fast. Shut up, you fools! That's his sister. You always show up where you can help. They let me leave Batoche is morning. -What are they saying about Ronnie? -They're all out of their heads. Do any of you know where Ronnie is? -They don't know, April. -Keep that stretcher working, Sheriff. -Doctor, the inspector's real bad. -Alright. Get this man ready. l'll be back. -Some brandy here. -Sergeant, bring that brandy. -He's lost a lot of blood, no? -Yes. -Jim... -l'm glad you're safe -but l wish you were anywhere else. -l tried to get here in time. l could have saved all this... l'd give that tourniquet another twist. Where's Ronnie? -ls he... is he...? -No. l'm sorry. l have to go to the lnspector now. But... Don't fight. You'll be alright. l told you to take care of the men. -Yes, but... -Nevermind me. Get to the others. Yes, sir. ls there an assault? -Not yet, sir. -Man the bastions. l have, sir. Did you get proof that Logan deserted? Yes, sir. When this is over, make it your job to get him. Bring him to justice. Justice... l'm about to get mind. -Take command, Sergeant. -Very good, sir. Some fool at Headquarters, wants to change the uniform to green. Stand up for the Redcoats. lt's a good color. -Any sign of a rush? -Just steady sniping. -Tod... -Keep your head down lad -if you don't want to lose it. -Can you reach the river? There's a very good chance. Get the bateau and canoe and moor them 100 yards below. We'll try to get through tonight. That l will. -Take his place. -Right. Look! Look What l see! -Don't shoot. -He is police scout. He the Scotch man. He's mine! Nobody shoot. Where is the knob from the bonnet? Darn! Blood of the devil! Bonjour, you snake in the bush? Duroc, you old porcupine. -Foosh to you. -You son of a pumpkin? That's a pawky trick. You snooling clootie! Who is snooling clootie? You bairn of a buzzard. My yarn, my bonnie yarn! l'll never dare to show... Aye. You... You skunk you. Such a thing! Darn these pants! Hold 'em up with your teeth. You, dirty Scotsman! Bonnie thing you look going naked through the fen. For goodness sakes! Yon goes the seat of the government? Blood of a skunk. l'll show you. Pig! Sharpshooter down there seems to have McDuff cornered. -Got a sight on him? -No. He's behind... Now l can. Dan! Dan! Dan... l didn't shoot you. You win the 50 cents. No Dan. lt was from the fort. You showed yourself. You're an old fool my friend. One more game of pinnacle l skin from you the belt. Aye, that you would Dan. -That you would. -No, Tod. l lose. No, Dan, it is my loss, every man's loss this day. The Big Trapper got me by the neck. The 50 cents she's in my pocket. Soup? -Any more soup and they'll bust? -l must get this... -Stop carrying it long enough... -But... You've been ramming around here for 10 hours, using up all the Queen's bandages and l never saw you beat. Well, you haven't been playing croquet. Special orders is you stop now. And have a cup of coffee. Dusty, what happened? Happened? Did something happen? l didn't notice anything happening. l don't like women who cry. You know something, lady? l make the best coffee in Texas. You can float a horseshoe in my coffee. Over and over l hear them say his name but they won't tell me anything. Look... just kind of -get down some of this Java -Even Jim won't tell me anything. Two sugars? Jim is a great soldier. But if you don't drink this here coffee... Where is Ronnie? What's happened to him? Now listen... l don't know Ronnie so very well but l know you. The first time l saw you l knew you better than anyone l've known. l know it couldn't be in your brother's blood to be cowardly. But, love does funny things to people. You've been a good soldier. l've got a tough job for you, if you'll take it. You want me to put some salt on Corbeau's tail? l'm trying to get the wounded to the river under smoke cover. -What smoke? -We'll burn the fort. -Coffee? -Thanks. lt'll be your job to get April and the wounded down the river to meet Colonel lrvine's reinforcements. -You'll stay and roast chestnuts? -l have 7 men sound enough to ride. l'll be there when Corbeau throws those red coats in front of Big Bear. Looks to me like you're just delivering seven more red coats. Maybe. Jim. You've got to tell me. l know it. But let me tell you first that l love you. Always l guess. You'll never be able to look at me again. Nothing under heaven can ever bring us together... What do you mean? You've got to know it, so l'd rather you knew it from me. Ronnie is not dead. He deserted. He left his post, left his companion sentry. He was killed. He could have warned the column. All those men lying dead might still be living if Ronnie... -but he ran away. -No, no! He ran away with that half breed Corbeau's daughter! But l sent her to him, to warn him, to warn you. Didn't you know he'd sell his soul for that girl? l don't believe Ronnie deserted. lf you prove it to me 100 times, l still won't believe it. Jim lad, the half-breeds being a wee bit confused with the death of poor Dan Duroc. lt's the time to be going. Tell Corporal Underhill to have the patrol in full dress order sidearms and rifles then set fire to the buildings. Aye, all is ready then now. l hope you never believe Ronnie is guilty but that doesn't change my job. When this over l'm going to get him and bring him back. l will get him if l have to follow him over the icecap. You know what that means for him. l know you're duty comes before everything else. l know it means more than mercy or love. Go on, follow your orders. Kill that boy who was foolish enough to put love first! But don't tell me how sorry you are! Just do your duty and kill! We'll take you and the wounded as far as the river. Dusty will take care of you there. We're going on to Big Bear's camp. Pray that l don't come back. You'll have to let me look after you now. -Better throw some wash in my face. -What? l have no right to be crying over my troubles. The wounded must be moved. They'll need all the help we can give. Looks like you need some help yourself lady. Attent hut! This is a volunteer patrol. Once we've entered Big Bear's camp no man of you can properly expect to come out alive. lf any of you prefer to go with the wounded you may fall out. Thank you. Fyffe, you're hurt. You'll have to go with the wounded. No, l'm alright. l can fight. Join the wounded as directed. Yes, sir. We'll take the wounded to the river first. Keep them under cover. Corporal, mount the patrol. Patrol! Prepare to mount. They die in there you think. Maybe so. l don't see nobody come out. Men with leg wounds man the paddles. Dusty and McDuff, scout the shores with a canoe. lt's a dangerous place you choose lassie. l can't leave these two men. They're the worst hurt. Good luck, Soldier. Thanks. That'll be Colonel lrvine's relief column. ln camp, beyond the bend. That's a pretty sounding noise. l was afraid these boys would never see that camp. You're going to and you'll get some rest. l'm leaving. -Why? -Going hunting. lt's no use. Jim has Corbeau by now. -Or Corbeau has... -l wasn't thinking about Corbeau. Ronnie? Well, l'd like to have a powow with the wolfgirl he's been with. Ronnie's dead. l know he is. He wouldn't run away. He'd come back and face it. Sure he would. Maybe he can't come back. Maybe he sort of lost his head. l got a feeling l can make things easier for you if you'd let me. You're grand person, but there's nothing anyone can do for me. Sure there is. Come to Texas with me. lf Ronnie's alive, he'll find us there. l'll never see Ronnie again. He's gone. Not when somebody cares as much about you as l do. lf you want what's left of me after all this l'll go with you. l'm a coward Dusty! l want to run away. You're the loveliest and gentlest woman l've ever known but you haven't closed your eyes in 24 hours. l don't want you to say yes without thinking. l don't want to think. When we get to Texas, you won't have to. -Texas must be heaven. -lt will be when you get there. Pull into shore Tod, then take April down to lrvine's camp. l'm splitting off here. What manner of frisky are you up to now?. Well, there's a couple of things l got to do. l kept my promise Big Bear. Red coats full of holes like a net. This one belonged to that Sergeant who said he'd put me in irons. Medicine gun speak like thunder. Keep your promise, Big Bear. War! Kill. War! War! So dead men ride? You cannot kill the dead. Tell your war chief to spread his blanket on the ground Big Bear? Tell your men to fire! Kill the dogs! You tell me they are dead. Let us know what dead men want. Nestestu! Put the blanket here. The blanket! Put the blanket here. The spirits of the brave are still inside their red coats. They are sacred. Tell your men to lay them on the blanket. The brothers of the dead are brave. Put them on the blanket. No, no! These enemies are in your hands. Pull them down! Kill them! Now! lf one shot is fired, the soldiers of the Queen will come like the sands of the great salt sea. You and your sons will die and your children's children will never walk on the Earth. The other coats Big Bear. We are waiting. Put the coats on the blanket. Pull 'em off the horses! Kill them! Are you afraid of 7 men? Kill them, you fools! There's no magic in their red coats. Throw them to the crows. Like this. You're under arrest! Shoot, you fools! Shoot! Shut up! Two men on the left, dismount. Take the prisoner. -On your feet, now. -What's the matter? Tired? You're too heavy to carry. Will Big Bear kneel to the Queen and be the chief of his people again? The Cree are brothers to the brave. This fellow keep Redcoats out of Batoche. Look! The canoes go down river by himself! lt's my bateau, come on! Look! Come on! -Let's go! -Don't let him go. You know Louvette? No Gatling gun, no Riel, no lndians, no fight. You come home, l give you all the fight you want. Yes, mama. -You know Louvette Corbeau? -l know no one like that. Well, l guess that's right. -You want something? -You know Louvette? -Yes. -Of course. -Louvette Corbeau? -Sure. Come on. Are you hungry? No. You don't feel good, huh? l feel alright. A man's brain can be sick. He goes on breathing and living until he rots. My heart wants you so much. She all the time say your name. Ronnie, Ronnie... l should have torn your tongue out the first time l heard you say that. No, we go away Ronnie. Way up to far North. To land of little sticks. Nobody don't find us there. One man l can't get away from even there. A filthy rat that can't stand the sight of his own face. Me. My love, l make you forget. Forget? l ought to...! You want to kill me? l'm too much of a coward even to do that. Because l love you. Two wild geese go north. Hello, Ronnie. Why you come here? l was just passing by. lt looks like this war is kind of bogged down. You come here for hurt him? Nothing l say could hurt him any. lt's already been said. -What's been said? -Don't listen to him, Ronnie. l want to know! Well, that you ran from your post and you're hiding out like a skunk and haven't got what it takes to go back and swallow your medicine. -Does April say that? -No. She figures you're dead. She knows if you could even crawl you'd get back there to face 'em. Don't listen to him! lf you go back they kill you. She may be right. The militia's brought in martial law. You know the Mounted Police are a great body of men. For years they've been through hell without a yellow mark against them. l'd hate to see April's brother be the first to chalk one up. Make him go away. He just talk crazy lie for you. -l'm heading for Batoche, coming? -No, Ronnie, no! You coming? What for? l'm already buried in the grave of every man killed at Duck Lake. -They're bound to find you. -With your help? No, they don't never find. l fix so you don't tell nothing. l won't turn you in, but April's got a right to know. Why don't you let me stay dead? Because you're not a coward. Whiteman, ride horse with white face. Go quick, Crow. Go get him. Viva Canadian womens, fly my heart, fly high! Viva Canadian womens, who has so sweet the eyes! Who has so sweet the eye! Who has so sweet the eye! Ronnie? He's gone to Batoche. l loaned him my horse. Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie... Kill... Kill... Kill... How much l morn for you... Love does funny things to people. Captain Gower of the Canadian Militia is here to help us get what facts we can concerning the ambush at Duck Lake before the General convenes his court martial. Yes, sir. l'm the one to blame. Not my brother. l sent her to him, sent her to warn him. Miss Logan, none of us are on trial. We're only trying to find out what happened. l should have known Louvette would lie to him. -That she... -That she was in love with him and would persuade him to run away with her. That's not true! Ronnie wasn't afraid of anything. lf he's alive, he'll come back. l'm very sorry but the evidence we've gathered is conclusive. Sergeant, you are personal assignment is to keep after Logan until you've place him under arrest. Yes, sir. -That is all! -Capitan Gower... -What is it? -l don't know. Someone got killed. Fall back! Fall back there! Constable Logan reporting. Ronnie! -Who is this man? -An American Peace Officer, Texas Rangers. ls this Constable Logan's body? -Yes, sir. -l don't understand. This boy was captured. Look at his wrists where the thongs cut in. They thought you ran away... The man has been bound certainly. l don't know how he got loose but when l saw him he was free. Maybe he could have got back to report but he didn't. Because there was something he wanted more than he wanted his own life. -What do you mean? -l mean the Gatling gun. What did Logan have to do with the Gatling gun? The half-breeds had it on the bluff, commanding the south approach. We saw what happens to troops who rush a gun like that. But the kid could rush it because he was on the inside of their lines. Now you all decided he quit his post. Where l come from we don't jump to conclusions. lt's liable to be a fellow's last jump. l can tell you every move the boy made. And l can tell you this, if you'd had 3 more men like him you'd have put down your rebellion in 24 hours. He got their boats in the river to pull the crew away from the gun, then he got a horse and dragged the gun off riding like a bat out of hell. The half-breeds spotted him but he got the bluff above the river. Bullets were as thick as flies but they didn't stop him over he goes, horse, man, and gun rolling like a Texas twister over the sheer drop. That's where l find him. That's where you'll find the gun at the bottom of the river. He never gave up. He never quit. He never ran away from anything because it wasn't in him to run. He just kept going on like l think you'd want him to. Constable Logan shall receive the highest military honors. l'll mention Logan's bravery to General Middleton. Where were you all this time? l was squeezed under a log so tight l was breathing on the installment plan. Shall l include that in my letter to your Texas Commandant? l hope you won't. l'll be in trouble enough without Corbeau. Dusty! You're an angel in leather. l'd look funny with leather wings. l'm sorry l misjudged a brave man. Yes, we... all are. Sergeant! You will deliver prisoners Riel and Corbeau to Regina. -Last stop before Regina. -Long way to ride -before a hanging. -They don't think so. You be tying a wet knot. Eight days with them traveling 200 miles. Cold molasses could move faster. Thank you. -Where's Jim? -Went riding with April. lf l should disappear, you know, vanish will you tell April l'll be back for her? lf you're as blind on the trail as you are with your lassie you'll never find your way back. l could never manage one of these contraptions. lt's a shame to waste it. Either the hand of fate or someone thinks you ought to shave? Well? No, one maybe can get through, but there's no chance for two. Find your own finish. l'm ready for mine whatever it may be. l'll have my knife back now. l give it to you! No, sunny side up. Now we're heading back for Texas. l hid your horse under that silver mine you call a saddle. Just a minute, cowboy! Going somewhere? Don't look like l'm going very far. Come on out, April. lt's nobody but Dusty taking a little ride. Just trying to get away from it all. Can we ride a little way with you, Dusty? Why yes, ma'am. Do Canadians ever go snow blind in the summer? We're all a little blind sometimes. l'm not. There's talk some fellow may try to get Corbeau away from us. -How's that again? -lt's only 100 miles from the Montana border. And no telegraph. ls that so? l'll check when l get back. lf anyone's missing l'll have every man in the troop after them. l can't say l blame you. Jim, Dusty seems a little restless. Maybe he's thinking about a man who moved in on a friend that trusted him. Sneaked in behind his back like a weasel in a hen coop and stole the one thing his friend valued most. No, l wasn't thinking about that. Wouldn't you say he'd loathe his friend for doing such a low contemptible thing to him? He'd certainly owe him an apology. Well? l apologize. You apologize? Jim's trying to tell you that he's taking something he thought belonged to you. You? lf l'm free. She told me once, l'd be alright if something beat me to my knees. l've been brought down hard. No, l'm the one who surrendered. But l wouldn't change him. l guess l've just been having a beautiful pipe dream in the middle of a nightmare. Sure. Sure, you're free. You got what we both want, l got what l came for. l'll say the Mounted Police are the greatest outfit l ever tangled with and the luckiest. Texas Rangers are two fisted fighters themselves. And one of them is the most magnificent liar in the world. Goodbye, Dusty. Texas is gonna miss you. There'll always be a part of Texas in our hearts. Come on, sweetheart. Come on, sweetheart.
