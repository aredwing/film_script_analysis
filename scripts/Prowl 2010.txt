I'd really like to come take a look at the apartment, so if you could just give me a call back whenever you get this, that'd be great. Thanks. Bye. Dustin? What? No, it's Susie. You sound weird. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, so we're all meeting up at Ray's house tonight, and I need you to be there. I don't know. I think I'm just going to stay home tonight. No, come on, it'll be fun. And I need you to protect me against Peter. Please? - Okay. - Yeah? - Okay. - Cool. All right, I'll see you later. Come on, Keith, the sign says "open." Thank you. All right, just put it back unless you're gonna magically grow five years. I'm not 16, I'm 18. Oh, well, we got cigarettes on sale. No way! No fucking way! - Amber, how do you do it? - Sure, everyone just come on in. It's not like I got a dog or a wife to go home to. I bet Peter five bucks that I could run here before they could drive here. Nice work, Speedy Gonzales. Okay. What? I'm 21. In like two months, Keith, come on! Well, I'll see you then, Scorpio. I got it, I got it. - Finally. An adult. - Sorry. The van's been making that noise again. And we need some chips. - See you later, Keith. - Bye! Hey, Amber? Did you really run all the way from Ray's house? It's a small town. I think I can see the elliptical galaxy from here. Okay. Thanks. I see a big bear torso, but the lower half is a serpent. It's like... I don't know, it's like a naked chick - with a really hairy... - Be careful. ...muff. - You see where the crescent of stars? - Okay. If you look above that and then to the right... - Hey, did you get my... - Hey. I know that you did. I know that... Nachos! - Did you get any salsa? - Thank you very much. Did you get... Thank you. - Did you get any salsa? - No. They didn't get any dip. I can... I can give you some dip. You know what? Susie, you know I can't have this talk with you every single month. You always tell me that you're not gonna give in to him, and then you do. And then you always tell me how weird it is the next morning. And I have to say, "I told you so." Yeah, well, not this time. Not this time? No. Not this time. Maybe you should. Then he can lick the beer off your face. - Yeah, he'd like that. - Yeah, I'm sure he would. Well, I need another beer. - Do you want one? - No, I'm good. I didn't spill mine on me. I don't know. Maybe. Let's just see what happens. Nothing just happens. You gotta make a move. I know. Okay. How many chicks have you been with? All right, look, I'm on a mission now. By the end of the night, you'll be screaming Amber's name in ecstasy, - and I am gonna help you. - Well, I didn't ask you to. How? By creating a sexier atmosphere. Take this. Who's up for some skinny-dipping? Susie! Get naked with me. Amber. Jump in for once. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing... Come on. Don't be such a fucking freak! Peter! What? Amber, come on, I didn't mean it like that. We cool? Yeah. We cool. Alrighty. This is gonna be awesome! Come on! Three, two, one! What are you doing? Eric! You want some food? Nah. Nothing tastes good in this town anyway. I just need to get out. You always say that. Yeah, but this time I mean it. This town eats people alive. It's not that bad. Yeah, for you. Well, yeah, I like this town. I'm happy here. I won't be happy till I spend my first night in the big city. Well, when you know what you want, you can't let anything hold you back. Thanks. You know, I really needed to hear that. What? I thought we were... You thought wrong. Mom. Mom, come on. Let's get you into bed, come on. Is your father home? Yeah, in the urn on the mantle. - For over a year now. - Oh, God. He always used to wake me up, take me up to bed. Yeah, if throwing you on top of the covers and coming back out to watch TV counts. Come on. Come on. I'm sorry. You're a good girl. You know, your father, he wanted a boy, but I'm so glad that they gave us you. What do you mean, "They gave you me"? People... The nice people at the agency. The agency. What agency? Mom. Mom! Shit. Hey, Amber. You all right? - Hey, Dustin, it's Amber. - Hey, Amber. Listen, I was gonna call you. I just got a better offer on the apartment. - What? - Yeah, this guy, he... No, no, no, no! You said... No, I said I'd hold it for you. I didn't say how long, though. And this guy has got, you know, cash and everything, so, you know. Look, Dustin, you are the only one that can help. I need this apartment, please! If you can bring me first and last month's rent by noon tomorrow. Really? Yeah, but you'd have to bring it in cash, though. I have to be in Chicago by noon tomorrow 'cause I'm going somewhere... - Okay, thank you so much. - No, it's all right. - Thank you. - All right, cool. - See you tomorrow then. Bye. - Okay. Bye. God, you're really moving? First of the month. But I have to get the deposit in by tomorrow. I'm gonna miss you. A little. I'm gonna miss you, too. What do you need? A ride. A ride? You know my car got impounded. No. No, no, no. Peter will drive us if you ask him. I can't, it was really weird this morning. You're so right about that, again. You know how important this is to me. You're really doing this, aren't you? Not without your help. I tell you what. Peter gets off work in an hour. See if Ray can drive, and if he can't, I'll get Peter to do it. Oh, my God, a road trip! That sounds so fun! My God! We can all go dancing at a club! Hell, yeah, let's do it! I just need you guys to drive. My dad found out I had a party. I mean, did you see the boot on my car? I can't drive it for a week. - Why are we even washing it? - I don't... - I don't know why we're washing it. - It's such an unusual disciplinary reaction. I know, right, the punishment restricts me from leaving the very house I fouled with my antics. - God, your dad's weird. - God, your mom's sexy. - My mom? - Guys, guys! Look, I'll buy the gas if someone else drives. - All right, just keep your phone on. - Yeah. Okay. - My mom? - Your mom, yeah. We can crash at my cousin's. All you have to do is drive. But my car's in the shop till tomorrow. - What about your mom's car? - What about your mom's car? I can't tell my mom about this until I have everything figured out. All right, I get it. And I think it's really cool that you're doing this, but my mom needs her car for work. Let me try some of my friends. Thank you. You're a good guy. You can be a dick sometimes! You know, there is one more person you can try. I still think I should... Well, yeah, that would have been perfect. - But what? - But Eric's driving so it's okay. - I know... - It's such a turn-on. Weed cock. You get high when you suck him off. Fuck! - Have we stopped? - What? You're kidding. What the fuck! - You're so stupid! - Shut the fuck up! You knew it was making noise. Why didn't you take it in? I was going to! I think I can see my house from here. God, it's like this town won't let me leave. You know, I knew I should've taken the bus as soon as I found out. Call the guy and ask for more time. This is the more time. - Hey, excuse me! Hello! - Hey! - Excuse me! - Can you stop, please? He's not gonna stop. I think we might have to hoof it home. You're such an idiot. - Shut the fuck up! - What is wrong with you? Wait, wait, wait. - That's coming, right? - Yeah. - Hello, sir! - Excuse me! That's a big truck! Hello! Can you wait? Wait! Hello! - Please stop! Come on, our truck's broken! - Excuse me, sir! Please! - He stopped? - He's just getting a look at Susie. - No. - No, he's fucking stopped. High-five. Engine overheated? I don't know. Well, let's take look. Maybe it's leaking coolant. That'd be a sweet, steamy scent, and it wouldn't break it down. See, it's hot and metallic. Yeah. She overheated. I can fix a lot of things, but I can't fix that. And I'm fresh out of water supplies myself. You unlucky ducks need a tow truck. I'm sorry I can't help you. I'm sorry, Amber. Looks like we're not going to make it. It's me. Did you not hear me calling you? What happened? This guy. He's going to Chicago. What? So you think you can take us? No, no. I could get fired for that. Come on, we're not going to tell anyone. Damn right. There's nothing to tell. - What are they talking about? - Do you think I should go over there? Listen... We need to get to Chicago. And you're going to Chicago. It's, like, fate. I don't believe in fate. What about money? Go get... It's not about money. Look, you don't understand. I'm finally getting out of Famfield. I've already waited too long. If I let anything else get in my way... Well... I checked out of my one-horse town when I was about your age. You ever heard of Gunter, Texas? Exactly. Worst city ever shat out onto God's green earth. One thousand fifty-six people. Every last one waiting for me to come crawling back from San Antonio. Wasn't easy, but, besides my wife and three kids, best thing I ever did. So you do understand. So how much should I give him? Put your money away. I totally understand if anyone doesn't wanna go. But it's 19 hours until my deadline. And we've already tried everyone we know. - I have no choice. - You always have a choice. We're down. I mean, I think it'll be fun. How do you know we can even trust this guy? We don't. But I've got an idea. Hey. First of all, we really appreciate the ride. But for safety's sake, we have a couple of conditions. Shoot. Okay, well, one of us will ride up front with you. That was going to be one of my conditions. A little conversation will keep me awake. Okay. We also need to take photos of you and your truck to send to our friends, just in case. - Done. - Great. What else? - That's it. - That's it? - That's it. - All right. - Let's go. Make sure we get our stuff. - All right. Smile again. And keep smiling. So who's riding up front? It should be one of the guys. Yeah, it should be one of the guys. But, baby, I want you riding in the back with me. Okay, baby. That's fine, that's fine. Paper, rock, scissors. - Ready? - On three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three! Yes! Guess you're in the front. - Have fun. - Cheers, buddy. Take care of him! - We'll see you on the other side. - Will do. Thank you very much. Where are you? There you are. If you have any kind of an emergency back here, just bang on the sides and I'll pull over, okay? All right. Thank you. Whatever you do, don't touch them goods, okay? Good enough. I'll see you in the Windy City. ...two, three. Go on, buddy. - No! - Go, go, go, go! Yes! It sounds really fancy. How did you find it on the Internet? I don't know, I was just searching one day, and I came across it. And your cousin's going to come and, like, visit you and stuff? Is it okay if we can stay... It's like watching a film, like, out of sync, I don't know. All right. He's a good guy. She said you were adopted? Yep. It's disgusting. I don't even like vodka. But it all makes sense, you know? I knew they couldn't be my real parents. Just another reason to move out, right? You know, if this all works out for you, maybe I'll move out, too. Really? Why not? - What do you think is in these boxes? - He said don't go near the cargo. - I'm just looking at it. - Maybe it's drugs. You think it's drugs? No way! He would not risk taking on six passengers if it was drugs. - Come on. - Unless... No, you're right, he wouldn't do that. - Can you... - Take it away. - We should play a game. - Yes! - Truth or dare. - Yes! - I'll play. Let's get high and naked. - I'll play, 'cause that sounds enjoyable. Okay. Peter. Truth or dare? I think I'll start with truth. Have you ever been unable to perform with a girl? Like with little Peter down there? - All right, there was this one time. - I heard it was more than once. - No, you did not. From who? - Carolyn. - She's a fucking vile... - And Jana. Is it your turn, Goldilocks? No, it's not. So save your truth for your turn. I would, but I'm going all dare tonight. - Susie... - Dare. I dare you to make out with me. God, I can't look. Get a room! And now it's a game. Let's see... Amber. - Dare. - I dare you to kiss Susie. - Oh, my God. - Really? Okay. Oh, God, I can't watch. I can't not watch! Shit! You all right? God. You okay? Fucking asshole! What is going on? I'm gonna find out. Hey, Bernard! - Bernard! Pull over! - Bernard! Bernard! Bernard! Pull over! Bernard, pull over! Bernard! Bernard, pull over! Let me call Eric. Who has the phone? Quick. My bag. - Hello? Hello? - Eric, what the fuck is going on up there? - No, this is Bernard. - Bernard? Sorry about the brakes. Stray dog ran right out across the interchange. What's going on? Where's Eric? - Let me talk to Eric. - Say again? Why are you answering Eric's phone? The poor little guy fell asleep almost soon as we sat up here. Wake him up and hand him the phone. He looks so darn peaceful. I wouldn't dare wake him up. Wait, I thought he was supposed to be keeping you awake. So did I. He's in a deep sleep. I'll check back in a few, okay? Bernard, hello? What the fuck! What's going on? Get ready to call 9-1-1. I don't even know where we are. It looks like we're still on the interstate. I can't tell which one. Shit. Hey, Amber. Bernard, Susie and I need to use the restroom. If you don't stop, it's going to get really, really messy back here. We're almost there. If you can just hold on a few more minutes. Okay, but Ray and Fiona are really sick. They're gonna puke all over the place. Nothing a hose can't fix. Just see if you can all just hang on. Bernard, just please stop the truck! What's he saying? I'm sorry. Fuck! We need to call 9-1-1. Now! It's ringing. Hello? We're stuck in the back of this... It's not... It's not working. What the fuck? It was working a minute ago. We need a new plan. What is this place? Fuck. Shit. All right, all right. We have to get out of here, we have to jump out! What? Are you crazy? What other choice do we have? Wait, wait, wait! What about Eric? Look, I can't help him from here. All right, we have to get out first. Baby, do you smell that? Peter. Peter, look. Stand back, stand back. What the fuck is in those boxes? All right, where the fuck are we? Why are there holes in the walls? What? Why would there be holes in the back of a cargo semi-trailer? Why was there already a dented spot? What the fuck is this? - Fuck! - Shit! Fuck it. Jesus, is that a knife? Where'd you get that? Why the hell are you carrying a switchblade? For protection. Just put it down, okay? Look, I am telling you there is something really weird in these boxes. - I want to know what it is. - What are you even doing right now? Jesus! What the fuck! - Is that blood? - Give me the knife. Jesus! Come on. No, no, no! No, wait, stop! You're gonna break it! Stop! He's backing up. I can't see any... All right, help us, we're trapped in here! Somebody get us out of here, please! Okay, get the lights. - All of them. - Shit! Grab them all. Fuck. If that door opens, we move. Stick together, okay? What if someone comes in? Then we'll deal with it. Where do you think we are? I don't know. But I'm not sticking around any longer than I have to. It's a prank. What, are you kidding? We are way past prank! No, no, no. No, this... This is all bullshit. Think about it. None of us are hurt. We've been tossed around a bit, some red stuff came out of a box, and now we're freaking out? No, it's like that TV show where they try to scare people. Wherever we are, they want us to go inside and film us making asses out of ourselves. No. No, can't you feel a dark energy in here? - Babe, you're stoned. - Okay, but that doesn't change the fact that some really fucking weird shit has been happening. No, she's right. This is a bad place. I can feel it. Jesus, I can smell it. I can't smell anything. Listen to me, if there are cameras in here, then they've already got footage of us freaking out, all right? Yeah, and showing our asses. I'm telling you, we're being hosed. - They're just trying to scare us. - It's fucking working, okay? I'm not signing shit, all right? You do not have permission to use this footage. - What about Eric? - I do not look good on camera, okay? I did a project at high school. I looked like a fucking dick. Who's there? Who opened the door? - Come on. - We can't go in there. - What choice do we have? - We can't go in there! This isn't funny. Look, we can't just sit here, okay? We have to find a way out. Come on. Dude, what the fuck! Jesus. Come on. It's like a giant warehouse. There's no way around it. What kind of deliveries are they getting in here? There's gotta be another door or a service entrance or something. - Shit. Are you okay? - Shit. Yeah. I've seen this before. Pigs and shit. We're in a slaughterhouse. What? How do you know that? They're paint this kind of shit on the walls, too I don't know, brainwash the employees. You sure? My uncle worked in one for six years. Why do you think I'm a vegetarian? It's just a big empty space. You know, there'd be machines... It must be abandoned. For years, probably. So it's not a slaughterhouse anymore. Shit! Someone closed the doors. There's a door, there's a door! Ray, hold this. Come on! Can someone help me with the door. We need some piping or something. Over here. Come on. Ray, come on! Okay, come on. Come on! Hurry up! Who's there? Hurry up. - Did you guys hear that? - Yeah, what is that? - Peter, hurry up. - Shut up! Okay? Shut up. Jesus. Hey, guys... Baby? - Ray? - What the hell... I don't know. Ray, quit playing around. Ray? Guys. Guys. Baby? Shit. - Fiona! - Fiona! Shit! I'll fucking kill you! Peter! Oh, my God! Peter! Somebody help him. What are those things? I don't know. What are we gonna do? You got to keep pressure on that. We're fucked, aren't we? Just... Just let me think. Go! Go! Go! Fiona, come on! Go! Go! No! Fiona! Fiona! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Over there. They know we're out here. Should we run? What happened to Eric? I don't know. I made him sit up front. Somebody had to. It was his choice to come. God. Where did he go? It's not your fault, Amber. It's all my fault. No. Listen to me. Listen. I am still alive. So are you. So, just pull your shit together, okay? Riding in the truck was my idea. I know. So, it's not your fault. It's not your fault, either. Your phone. Your phone. Fuck. All right. All right. I know. I fucked up. Shit! I'm sorry. I did the best I could. I got kids to feed, too. Wait. Cruise the perimeter. See if you can spot them. How much you wanna pay for that? All right. I'll cruise the goddamn perimeter. Let's go for it. They'll spot us. We need to help them. There's no use letting a meal get away, let alone two. No one's getting away. You know, if I step in now, they'll think I'll always be there to clean up after them. They have to learn. You saved one for me? He didn't even refrigerate the boxes and stuff. We need him out there right now. You, too. Monitor, but don't interfere. Fuck. Look. Look. - Stay. - No. Please don't go, Amber. Stay. Amber. Eric. Eric. Eric. Eric. Eric, can you move? Eric. Eric. God. No. Amber. Amber. Come on. Eric, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Eric! Are you okay? Fuck. It's okay. We're going to get out of here. What are you? What are you doing here? Practicing. Hunting. Why us? - Why us? - It's usually junkies. So, you've done this before? They have. It's my first time. I've got one of your people! If you make a move on me, I'll kill him! You understand? What's that lady's name? Veronica. I want to speak to Veronica! Is Veronica your mother? No, no. Well, does she care if you live or die? She takes care of us. I'm just gonna walk away! I won't say anything to anyone! I just want to go home! Do you hear me? Answer me! All right, fine. I just want to get home. Bernard, what was that noise? Bernard. Bernard, pick up the phone. Bernard, answer me. Bernard. Fuck. Fuck. It's all right. It's okay. You're a late bloomer. What's happening to me? You've finally awakened. I've been training my young hunters here for years. I guess it was just a matter of time before we roped in one of our own. I knew something was strange when I saw what you'd done to the side of the truck. And then when I saw you running. No human can move like that. You like your steaks rare? Maybe raw? But the older you get, the worse the food tastes. Perhaps you recoil at the sight of blood. That's denial of what you truly are. What am I? You're one of us. But you killed all my friends. I'm sorry. But that was your old life. It's time to begin a new one. These are the strays. The ones I found over the years. They're just like you. They're your new friends. Come down, little one. You're home now. - Are you... Are you my... - No. I'm not your mother. But, yes. Do you understand? Birth amongst our kind is a violent process. It almost always involves death, mother or child. That's why so many orphans. Whoever your true mother was, she was one of us. I lost a child in birth a long time ago. And I've spent every day since then seeking out my kind, taking them in, and helping them to be who they are. I just never expected to find one this way. It's been a rough night for you. Here's what you've been missing. Is that better? Better. It's nothing. An appetizer. Now, for the meal. Susie! It's best not to name them. You'll understand why. You'll understand everything once you sink your teeth in. Hold on. Come on, come on. Come on. Run. Come on. Come on. Let her go. She'll be back. I'll be right back, okay? I'm going to be right back. Amber! Get off me! Get off her! Get off! It's all right. It's going to be all right. We made it.
