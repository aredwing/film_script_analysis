The King sits on top of them, so they must beware of things from below. Beware of what, Dad? If they lost their swords, they would use their body as weapons. Throw, Crush, Grab and Break. - What do they need to be careful of? - I cannot tell you yet. But I'm going to be a Jaturungkabart, I have to know. Not yet, Kham. One day you will know. Go on. Splash him, son. How's that, Por Yai? Better? You're so naughty! Is he up to his old tricks again? Why did he do that to you? Dad. I'm here. Father. Where's Por Yai going? Oh, let him go, son. Lasso it. Come on. That's it. Pull it, pull. Korn Look, I have something to show you. Nice, Eh? If I ever had the chance to present Por Yai to the King, it would be the biggest honour of my life. It would mean that I upheld the name of the Jaturungkabart. Say goodbye to Por Yai, Kham. After Por Yai has been checked we might not have the chance to see him again. This is a great opportunity for you. There's no reason to worry. ANNUAL SONGKRAN WATER FESTIVAL Mr. Koi, this way. Hello. Welcome. - Hello Mr. Koi. - Please, come inside. Everything's ready. Come in. - Go on, Korn. - You wait here. Your father should go in alone, okay? Wait outside. - This is Supoj, a friend of mine. - Hello, sir. He takes care of this place. He'll arrange everything for you. Do you want a bell? Do you want one? For your elephant. - How much is this one? - 40 Baht. Let me see. That's lovely. Round one. Super! Thank you. Come on. Wait! Are you taking him away today? Yes, today, Mr Koi. You can go home now. We'll be in touch. - But... - Come on. Quickly. Move it. Come on. Quickly. You can't take him. Not yet. I won't let you. You can't take him. I said you can't take him. - I won't let you. - Calm down, old man. - Force it to go. - I said no! You old fart. I told you! Move it. Quickly. Come on. Father. Father. What happened, father? - Father. - Kham. Check on Por Yai. Didn't you see the truck? Move it! Baby, we belong together, in the forest with a joyful heart. The waterfall pours down as if heaven was before our eyes. Hey! Who the hell are you? Do you want my foot in your mouth? Go on. Get him. Go get him! My teeth! Wait for me. Where are Por Yai and Korn? - Where are they? - I don't know. You don't know? Johnny took them. They're in Sydney. Where is he? Father! Shoot! Shoot him, Father! Enough. Enough. You're hurting me. Come on. Quickly. Move it. And this is the main Asian market in downtown Sydney. Most of the people here are Asian, you know? Chinese, Thai, Vietnam... So officers here need to understand Asian's way, like me, for instance. This is how I do my job. It's important to stay mates with the people. What beautiful mangoes. They look lovely. Love, I'll be there in two shakes. Why? Do you miss me? Woah! Take it easy, baby. I give you a kiss first. I love you, bye. Hey! Just in time. This is my new partner, Rick. He's a young energetic kind of bloke. But less hard-working than I am. Sergeant Mark, there is a robbery on Burwood Street. Why did you call the police? What am I supposed to do? Stay calm, don't shoot. Don't hurt us! Go away! - Don't shoot. - I'm going to kill them! The robber is a teenager. Only the shop owner and his wife are in the shop. Alright! Listen up! I want you to drop your weapon... Rick, Rick. No, no, no. Leave him to me. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. Let's talk, okay? Oh, Tui, you fucking idiot. What the hell are you doing? How'd you know it was me? Anyone could recognise that face! Put the damn gun down. Put it down! Don't come any closer. If you shoot me, you'll be in deep shit with your mother. Don't lie to me, my mom isn't here. She is. Look behind you! You stupid boy. No, no. Stop, stop. Hey, stop, please. Come on. Imbecile. Hey look they've caught the guy. They're so brave. It's been just another day. Anyway, enough fun for now. OK, bye. Excuse me Mark, one more question, please. Go on, run. Don't be such a wimp. How could you do that, Sarge? It's against procedure. - It's no use arresting junkies, Mark. - But the rules... Put a sock in it! Don't you know? Just forget it. You idiot! Go! Go! Let's go. From all the exits to the meeting room, guards are placed every 10 metres. Uncle, I have arranged everything for you. I've hired Sydney's top chef to make abalone soup, I made it for all of you. I hope everyone will try it. Especially you, Uncle. It'll keep you healthy. And with good health, you'll be able to look after the family business forever. This isn't abalone soup! It's bland, there's no flavour. It tastes like earthworms. You know earthworms, right? Slithering insects which have two genders without being either. If you can't even provide proper food for me, how do you expect to protect me? For security, it's better to let Cheng handle it. That would be better. Concentrate on the restaurant I gave you. That's enough responsibility for you, Rose. That stupid old man made me lose face in front of everyone. You don't need to be angry or impatient. You already have this, don't you? Sorry. Sorry. G'day, mate. Where's a pretty boy like you from? Next question. Where we going? Oh, you're up early. Okay. Right ahead. Tom Yum Goong. Yeah, I know it, great food, beautiful girls, too. You like girls? Tell me, did you get into this country illegally? You know the big gates? You got a passport? Change of plan! Hang on! Come on! Yeah! Look at them. Good for nothing! Mark, Jimmy's heading to Thaitown. - Requesting back up immediatety. - I'm on it. A tricycle's faster than this. Stop here! - Is that the best you can do? - I'm trying. God, you drive like a pensioner. Shit! Come on boy, come on. Keep away from me. Let's talk. Okay? I don't wanna talk! Just get away! Hey! Can't you hear me? Piss off! You want me to shoot him? I'll shoot him! - Stop! - One! Piss off! Piss off! Okay, I'm cool. I give up. What the hell you doing? - He was a hostage! - No, he wasn't. Now go get him. I said go get him. I didn't do anything wrong. I'll handle this. Vincent didn't have to shoot him. Don't you think he went a bit far? Jimmy was no ordinary thief. I knew him well. And this guy was not with him. - How do you know? - I don't, I just have a hunch. What are you doing here? - Oh! Are you Thai? - I'm speaking Thai. Do you think I'm Burmese? Are you in Sydney to break the law? I'm here to find Por Yai and my little brother. - Looking for relatives? - Yes. - What do they look like? - Like elephants. Elephants? Elephants? Who's like an elephant in Thaitown? Let's talk in my office. Mark. - Hello. - How's it going, Goong? - You keeping busy? - Not really. - You never eat here now. - I'm really busy. - There's a promotion on. - Yeah? - At lunchtimes. - Lf I have time. Tom-Yum-Goong is Thai food. So, why is the manager a Vietnamese guy? - That's Johnny! - Shut up! - Okay. See you. - Keep up the good work. - Follow them quickly! - I said shut up. - Be quiet! - Don't start any trouble. - Follow that car! Quickly! - Quiet down! Those are the people that took Por Yai and Korn. You can't accuse someone without any evidence. I have a photo, it's in the taxi. We'll talk at the station. Let him go. Stop or I'll shoot! You've got to see the secretary... Johnny, where are my elephants? Where are my elephants? - He's asking for his elephant. - Johnny! Give me back my elephants. Hey, we're both Thais. So, I'll warn you. Don't get involved with them. This is top quality. Kill him. Shit! - Do you think this is a game? - What are you doing? James! James! God! Make sure he's dead. You lost the suspect. And caused all that ruckus on the road. I'm taking you off the case. It's being assigned to someone else. As of now, you can help Inspector Vincent with the Secretary General's meeting with Mr. Sim. - Aren't you being slightly... - I'm not arguing with you. I put you with Mark, to keep him in line. I didn't expect you to start acting like him. We've had a report from Area 3 about drugs and an Asian shoot out. Everyone's fled the scene. There is evidence that needs to be collected. I don't understand why that area is so buggered up. The area that you, Mark, are so proud to protect. Where is Jimmy's body? And the evidence? - Look. Don't take anything. - I know. You're an ugly son of a bitch. Okay. Thanks. A Thai man with a red scarf? - What did we lose? - The lot. We've also lost our dealer. Who'll want to do business with us after this mess? Get the hell out of here. - Do you want me to? - Just get out! Alright, I got it. I know. I'll leave now. Kings sit upon the elephants. Vital areas are underneath. Enemies aim forthose areas. Soldiers protect the four most vital areas of the elephants. What are the vital areas, Dad? One day you will know, Kham. Police have released this photo of their main suspect. The authorities believe he was involved in the drug deal at a warehouse in King's Cross area. The suspect was seen wearing a red scarf. If you have seen this man, contact the authorities immediately. Alright. Let me get back to you. Thank you. To our success. Come here. My medicine... Go, go! What are you doing? Tui? What the hell are you doing? He forced me to do it, Sarge. I... What the hell? Rick! What's up, Senior Constable? You not familiar with your new gun? Take him! He and this Thai boy killed the Secretary General. Bring him back. Mike, go over there. Jason, go with him. Juan, go right here. Boss, he's gone. - One girl is missing. - Find her. The assassination of the Secretary General of the Police Bureau has shocked the city. Police are now tracking down Senior Sergeant Mark, who is well known in Chinatown. The coroner's report indicated that the finger prints on the gun belong to Senior Sergeant Mark. Police assume a dispute involving illicit drugs was behind the crime. Sergeant Mark can be seen in this secretly recorded tape illegally releasing a Thai convict. - Hello? - Mark, it's Goong. Where are you? I just saw the news, I'm worried about you. Don't say anything. Someone might be listening. Can we meet? Pla's just called me, she has evidence which can prove that you're innocent. She won't see me unless I see you first. No problem. Where? Mark. I'm sorry. Where's the camera? Let me go. Let me go, I don't know. Please. Let me go. Ever since Johnny came here it's been hell for everyone. Everyone from the waitresses to the manager. They built a secret entrance at the back of the restaurant for their V.I.P. Clients. Maybe the relative you are looking for is up there. Everyone wants to know what goes on up there. Where's Johnny? Don't let him in. Where are my elephants? Where are my elephants? What's he saying? Where are my elephants? Looking for this? Korn! Have you found your brother? Korn! Korn! - Korn! - Shit! An elephant! A real elephant! - How did you get here? - Korn! Come! Come! Be patient, Korn. You'll be safe here at the temple. Leave it to me. I'll take care of everything. You always seem to know what I want. How can I ever pay you back? How about this, to return your kind favour, let me get rid of those who stuck their noses into our business, my sweetheart. Hey, do you know where Kham and Mark are? - Do you know where they are? - No. Come on. Where are they? Where are Kham and Mark? Hey, Kham, We need to find a truck for Korn. Rose, the heir to the business should be Sim's son. But Chao is only 13. He's still a child. He can't run the family business. Then, the most suitable person should be Kang. He is the son of Third Aunt, who is the younger sister of Sim and your father. Yes, that's it. He's a graduate in Management. He'd take good care of the business. But I am also my father's child. I've devoted everything to my family. I would always help Uncle when he was still alive. Take a good look at yourself. You're neither a man nor a woman. How do you expect us to let you run the family business? We wouldn't be able to show our faces in public. Kang! What's wrong? Please don't scare me. Help! Help! - Help! - You! Why did you have to do this? The most suitable person is dead. What's wrong? Chao! And the second is dying. Is there anyone suitable left? In that case, I accept the responsibility. I hope we're not too late. Come on. Come on! Kham. You should take the elephant back to Bangkok. I have connections at the port. It'd be easy. - What about you? - Don't worry about me. And I promise to bring our business empire to new levels of greatness, especially now we have the full cooperation of the government and police. Since this is a new beginning for us, may I be the first one to announce a slight change of name of our business empire... Where's my elephant? Where is he? So, what am I gonna shoot first? The elephant or the monkey? Vincent... Asshole! Korn! You're scum! You son of a bitch. Your mother's a dirty whore! Johnny! Put the gun down. Put the gun down! Johnny, put down the gun! This majestic elephant will enhance your dominion. All will bow to you and the power which you hold. Stupid! What the hell have you done? Careful with my elephant. Bring him down, get him! Move! An elephant is most vulnerable at its tendons. If its tendons are severed, it will fall. Wait for me! Winch me up! Wait! Lower it down! Lower it down! Up! Up! Are you OK, Goong? A good man is always a good man, no matter where he is. I have good news. Your new partner. - Name? - Somsak, Sir. - Are you Thai? - How'd you guess? - Sarcastic too! - Excuse me. What about this Thai man with a red scarf and a baby elephant? Elephants have represented Thailand for many years. We respect them like brothers, or family. Thai people don't appreciate it if anyone tries to hurt an elephant. Actually, Thai people like peace. Peace, you know? But we don't like it when people take liberties.
