Ekk Sound recorded on system Tagefon FLOOR GIVEN TO THE POPULAR ARTIST OF THE REPUBLIC KACHALOV Whose are these scrawny bodies in lousy rags? From whence do these dirty, savage looks come? What future awaits them? What will become of them? Street boy today, enemy of labor and bandit tomorrow! During the world bloodshed their fathers perished in the Tsarist jaws, invaders tortured their mothers with a siege of hunger. Early childhood left their faces marked with the lines of anxiety. They roamed through the cities like a pack of nasty, starving wolves. What will save them? Charity? Moral education? They laugh at those things, just as we do! But we know something better: environment creates the man. Having measured the power of free universal labour, the Republic of Soviets will give them a start in life. We are erecting Giants of Industry in the unpopulated taiga. We have found the lever which sets the destiny of mankind in motion. We'll teach these street boys to make their way in the new world. We'll re-mould them into workers of the world edification. BE SURE "HE'S YOUR COMRADE" F. S.

In my day people didn't speak like that. So, are you coming with me? And your husband? Coming! Coming! So, shall we go to Kursovoy? But why, mummy? My dear! My sunshine! Chauffeur! Krimskiy Val. Chauffeur! Madame! You dropped a rouble. Thank you! How clumsy of me! - Thank you. - You're welcome! It happens. My case! They've stolen my case! Help! I've been robbed! My God, Lidochka! What is it? My case is gone! - Who did they rob? - It's none of your business. They didn't rob you, did they!? I put it right here, turned my back... MOTHER - MOTHER - Regina Yanushkevich FATHER - FATHER - Vladimir Vesnovskiy SON - SON - Mihail Dzhagofarov Father! Our Kolka is fifteen today! Aha! A well-grown boy! He's now taller than his father. Kolka! Hurry back, mother! Bring me an apple! - How much are apples? - One rouble. - Expensive! - Well, take a little more! - Ok! And you, what do you want? How much are apples? Hold him! Let me go! Buzz off! Poor woman! Bandits are growing up! Why bother cradling them? They must be shot. It's not their fault! Your mother's coming! Go meet her! Kolka! Kolka! We don't take the dead. She's gone, Kolka, your mother's gone! FATHER... ...SON... ...AND MOTHER. AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH KOLKA'S FATHER BEGAN TO DRINK HEAVILY. She's gone, Kolka! Mother's gone, Kolka! You understand? Dad! FOR THE TIRST TIME KOLKA SPEN THE NIGH ON THE STREET. DECREE: On the night of December 20th 1923, the arrest of street children will begin. The arrests will be carried out by teams of Komsomol volunteers, under the supervision of inspectors from the Children's Committee. The assistance of the police and railway guards in this task is hereby requested. - Comrade Skryabina! - Quiet! Comrade Portvinov - you stay at the door. And you - cover all the exits. CHILDREN'S COMMITTEE INSPECTOR SKRYABINA Maria Antropova Boys! Sleeping in a bed is more comfortable. VASKA BULLY Aleksandr Novikov On your guard! Dragnet! Damn you all! - Smash the cops! - Pigs! Kill them! - Kill the pigs! Let me go! Smash the cops! Comrade Martynov! Hold him tight! He bites! Get out! Get out of here! Let me go! Come on! Anyway, we won't stay with you. Damned cops! Come on! Come on, don't stand in the way! Quick, quick! From joints, underground nests, caves and tumbledown houses there were gathered that night more than a thousand homeless children, crippled by the street. In the Soviet Republic there shouldn't be poverty-stricken and homeless children. May there be instead strong and happy young citizens. A SPECIAL COMMISSION PERFORMED THE VAS AND COMPLEX TASK OF SELECTING AND DISTRIBUTING THE STREET CHILDREN. What is your occupation? I'm a streetwalker. Give me her form! Syphilis. - That's all for the girls! To the hospital - Let the boys in! To the hospital Have you got any parents? Have you got any parents? How long have you been hanging around? Why don't you answer? What do you want? Dope, vodka and girls! He said it! Volkov - institution. Oh! Mustafa Dude! An old acquaintance! - Hi! - Hi! Madam Pasha, hello! Hello, Mustafa, hello! - Where hasn't he been?! - Who doesn't know him? The leader of the whole gang. - Mister Misha, hello! - Hello, hello! What was your last escape? 12 times for theft. Escapes: 8 Arrests: 15 Did you escape from Rostov's institution? I escaped. From Saratov? I escaped. Have you been in Serpuhov's prison in Moscow? I escaped! Where should we send you now? I'll only escape! To the reformatory then. Lock him up! Savatat kurjat I'll escape! I swear it! Where are you going? Let's go to that room. - I won't go! I won't! - Let's go. Come on, come on! Here he is, Mustafa Dude! Hello! What do you want, comrade? My son has disappeared. Nikolay Rebrov Is he here with you, comrades? He doesn't appear on checklists. Really? Check the rooms. Come with me, comrade! A cop's coming. Let's ask for shag. This guy took 130 and is afraid to play! I'm a boy far from home, forgotten by people. Forgotten, abandoned, long long ago I've been an orphan, with no smile. I've been an orphan, with no smile. So I'll die, I'll die They'll bury me and nobody'll know grave of me and nobody'll know the grave of me And on my stone no music plays just early spring KOLKA DISAPPEARED... and nightingales just early spring and nightingales Comrades, do you think... Comrades! Attention please! do you think that such difficult boys ought to be isolated? I flatly refuse. In my opinion... I say and I must insist: kids like Mustafa must be sent to a reformatory. Locking them up is no solution. What do you propose? Comrades, we must think about what to do with these kids. They run wild and escape from anywhere, the devil only knows how! Prison!? Another solution must be found! Yes. We have to think about it! In my opinion there's nothing to think about. THE COMMISSION THEN commission then DECIDED TO CARRY OU AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPERIMEN Ah! Comrade cop! Hello, hello! Are you off your rocker? Saying hello to an empty room! Hey you, sissy! Why did they bring us here? For examination or what? Hey boys, look. Who's this? Comrade officer, you may go. - You're what! - Doctor! Hey guys, he's a doctor! Undress! Here it is, undress!! And pants, do we take them off? You're a doctor, aren't you? Okay, that's enough! Come on boys, get dressed! Get dressed, cheer up! - Here it is now, get dressed!! - Come here! - First undress, now get dressed!! - Come here. Come on. Come on, cheer up, get dressed. Sit down! Undress then get dressed! Look here, boys! You're just sitting here, spoiling the air! You don't want to go to an orphanage, do you? No! Right, right! You're good guys! What's there for you in an orphanage? And sitting here is such a bore. A real bore! And, oh boys, it's so good to be free right now! So! Here's the deal! A secret one! I'm setting up a factory - a commune in an ex-monastery. Join me. Who wants to come? As volunteers. We'll all work together. Woodworker, locksmith, shoemaker, mechanic, as you wish! And you'll run the commune yourselves. How's that? Complete trust! And you'll be free. Who wants to? Speak up! We know your communes! You'll pen us in a fucking dump! You'll put cops everywhere. What will you feed us? Thin broth? We'll be in prison getting on the cops' nerves! Go to hell! THE COMMUNE'S ORGANIZER SERGEEV: Nikolay Batalov Chew it over. As you wish. You can leave when you want. Okay. We'll go to your commune. You persuaded us, doctor! Effendi, good-bye! THE BOYS AGREED TO GO TO THE COMMUNE, ONLY SO THEY MIGHT ESCAPE ON THE WAY. WILL THERE BE MANY GUARDS? Come out! - Hello, comrade Sergeev. - Hi! - Your pass. - Good. WILL THE ESCAPE SUCCEED? Well, boys, come on! Come on! What's the problem, boys? Where is the guard? There won't be any. You're on your honour. Come on! WILL THEY RUN AWAY? OR NOT? RUN AWAY OR NOT? RUN AWAY? OR NOT? AT THE STATION SOMETHING BAFFLING HAPPENS... MUSTAFA THE THIEF IS ENTRUSTED WITH MONEY IN ORDER TO BUY FOOD FOR THE ROAD. Come on! RUN AWAY? OR NOT? Come in! GONE... GONE... Mustafa's here! Skilful fingers don't cheat. - That's great! - Well done, Mustafa! Well, Mustafa- May it be the last time! FIFTY KILOMETERS FROM THE RAILWAY... THE COMMUNE FACTORY Think of this as a loan from the governement. You'll work it off. Comrades! A telegram from Sergeev's commune. Mishka, more hot water NOT ONE OF THE ELEVEN RAN AWAY Vaska, rub my back EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFUL -SERGEEV Boys, I will now cut out the last for boots. This way! Here's the last! Well who wants to cut one? Come on! Have a try, we'll see! Mustafa, keep your end up! AND SO BEGAN THE TRANSFORMATION OF PICKPOCKETS, PURSE-SNATCHERS, BURGLARS, HOUSEBREAKERS AND THIEVES INTO LOCKSMITHS, TURNERS, FOUNDERS AND CASTERS. BUT THIEVES' SKILLS USEFUL TO THIS WORK WERE NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN. Mishka! Someone swiped the spoons! Really?! Yes. - Sit down, quick. - Faster, find a seat! - Ginger, here! - Everyone has to gobble up! - Give us some spoons! - Where are the spoons?! - Hey intendent, give us spoons! Give me a spoon, give me a blade, So good is my babe! Somebody swiped all the knives, forks and spoons. If we don't find them, their cost will be deducted from your pay. A spoon! It's hot! Who stole the spoons?! Give yourself up, Mishka! I won't be no pig! It's Grishka Cross-eyed who swiped them. I know that son of a bitch! Snuffy's eating and you're blowing! See what good fellows live among us?! I want spoons with my dinner! We won't cover up for anybody. We'll find them! AND IN THE EVENING... How much is this toy? Fish, golden fish!

Catch him! - Where is he? - Behind the tent. Here he is! Look! They're running! Beat him up! - Bandits! - They all should be killed! - Why are they beating him? - He stole some boots! You shouldn't beat a person. There are judges! To judge what! Just hit him on the head with the weight! Kill him! Why are they beating him? Maybe he didn't steal them for himself. Maybe he walks barefoot. - Poor kid. - We mustn't pity them, but kill them! He's not guilty! Come with me, mister, to the police. You're charged with bodily harm. Speaking! Where are you calling from? - Step up here, comrade! - Go, he must be arrested! Comrade chief, I held this citizen for grievous bodily harm. Your papers? I don't appear to have them with me. Only this document. FRIEND OF CHILDREN. TRADING LICENCE ISSUED BY M. Somnin TRADING LICENCE ISSUED BY M. Somnin Hey you, friend! What a bastard you are! Fathers and mothers!

The fuzz got scared! They flocked like an army. Brave boys! Good! Kolka brought us here. He led us here to go to the commune! Winter passed. The commune grew and developed. The workshops were processing on a large and important order. The awl, the chisel and the saw... ...were giving people a rebirth. It looked as if labour had won for good... but... the spring brought unexpected results. The elements' fury affected the commune. The delivery of raw materials stopped; production ceased. Unwelcome inactivity followed. Rows began. - It's like we're under arrest. - Not even a town nearby. - Let's leave this place! - We wish we could work! - Just hanging around. - We want to work! We can't play cards or drink vodka. No vodka! The machines are at a standstill! To hell with the commune! Right! Silence! Silence, d'you hear! Comrade Sergeev! We can't stay without work.

Why hasn't Nikolay Ivanovich come back yet? What are we gonna do? Boys! - Ginger! Why did you kill Snuffy? - It's our mutt. What do you care, you, midget?! They've driven us miles from anywhere but we'll leave anyway! We're lying idle; becoming sissies. Destroy the workshops. Smash everything! Smash everything to fucking pieces! Come on! Destroy the workshops! Everything! You'd destroy your living!? Live here yourself, you bugger! Hooligans! Boys! What are you doing? Can't you see they're destroying the workshops! - Beat him! - Kick him in the teeth! Let me! Let me, I tell you! And you came on your own to make shoes in the commune. Hey you! Swine! What's been going on? Boys! He killed Snuffy! Well, you sure made great use of your time! And I brought you... ...a little present! Look! We'll be building a railway from the commune to the station. And you'll be fully responsible for its upkeep, boys. - Do you understand? - Yes, we do. - Shall we go? - Let's go. - Mustafa... will be an engine driver! - Engine driver! And Kolka will be a fare collector! Fare collector. I'll be... ...a switchman! Whoever doesn't want to work, whoever wants to make trouble, then let him... ...leave now! Well boys, I hope I've said it once and for all! Boys! Toss Nikolay Ivanovich! - What? - Toss Sergeev! Boys! Here lie the tracks. Nikolay Ivanovich! The machines won't stand still anymore. You, poor head of mine Will still I bear you for long? You, my fatal destiny Will I still... live for long? THE UNDERWORLD STARTED TO BECOME CONCERNED. Why did I come into existence? What did my mother beget me for? THE BEST BOYS HAVE GONE AWAY In order to experience prison. Mustafa's gone! Kolka Whistle's gone! Don't stand on ice, cos' ice will crack Don't love a thief, He'll hit the sack Hey, the soup is hot, and so is the kettle, Hey, tears are dripping... AND...THE UNDERGROUND... ...on the handle. The thief'll collapse CONCEIVED A BIG BUSINESS and will glide high. You won't like that! Hey, the soup is hot, and so is the kettle, Hey, tears are dripping on the handle. Clients! Hello, old chap! Come in! "Here we value our dear visitors" "Here to drink, smoke and dance is highly valued... ...and to kiss... ...girls also" Visitors have arrived! Welcome them! THAT IS HOW, IN AN ABANDONED FOREST WORKMAN'S HUT, THE BIG BUSINESS BEGAN. Workers! My respect! Get out of my way! That was some walk they took! To Nikolay Ivanovich, my respect! Fifteen days! Fifteen days of drunkenness and shirking at work. You drunken mugs, where did you get pissed? Oh why, by what coincidence, to me you're the only one to please and all the others I just tease? They ripped my new dress up, And poked my right eye out It was the first time, so no! don't scold me, mum, don't shout!
