Did you have anything to eat? Just a bite. Did you? Yes, I did. I can fix you something if you like. Thanks. I'll have some. It's good. Seiji-san, breakfast is ready. I don't want any today. Won't you have anything to eat? I won't go to the office today. Let me sleep more. Are you sure? Yeah, I'll work at home. Alright. No, you don't have to talk with Yoshida. Buy up all the stocks of G&C anyway. That's my order. Don't worry. I'll talk to Yoshida. Oh, Yoshida-san, it's been a long time. Sorry to come this late. Please think about it. The game is over. If you try it too far, we can never remake the company. It's my company. I'll do as I like. Give me a break... Not only the company, but our lives will also be messed up. But you'll sell the company to Tsuyama, right? Tsuyama-san forgot the buyout we planned. Offering a tie-up deal. Do you really believe that? You know G&C swallowed many companies. But, do you still think you can fight that Tsuyama? We'll be smashed while we're struggling. Look, Yoshida. I'm evenly competing with Tsuyama. Leave it to me. What do you mean by"evenly?" Who do you think the guy is? You're the only one who doesn't see the results. Come in. Excuse me. Will you tell him to come to the office tomorrow? Yes, I will. Sorry for today. No, you don't have to apologize. Did you listen to our conversation? ...I think we'll face difficulty. If anything goes wrong, talk to me. Not as my boss' wife, but as a cousin. Thank you. Bye. Seiji-san, time to go. Oh, you're right. How's your company going recently? What? Nothing, but you've never asked me about my company... Sure I have. I'm going. I'll be late again tonight. OK, have a good day. Thank you for coming. Any trouble finding this place? I can't meet you near the office, so... That's OK. I wanted to hear what's going on. Nakahara-san is just being stubborn. Tsuyama, G&C was offering us a friendly deal, but he is just becoming perverse. He just doesn't like to be controlled by a big shot, I think. But can he involve his employees just because of his own selfishness? Aren't there any ways to help the company? No. Instead, Tsuyama is now preparing to launch a hostile bid for us. If it happens, the company won't belong to Nakahara and he'll have nowhere to go. The same goes for me. I've decided to leave the company. As you say, there will be no future. I'll go with you. Please let me work as you please. I'll never treat you badly. We'll manage the company together. Let's work that way. I asked her to come. What? May I date her? You've met Tsuyama, right? Yes, I met him once at a party. Would you meet and talk with him? What? We'd like to make the tie-up in a good way. Before he approaches our company, I'd like to get back on the track. But why me? Nothing goes well with Nakahara. Besides, Tsuyama remembers you very well. Sonoe... Yes? What's the matter with you? Do you enjoy your life? Yes, very much. Good. I think this is too much for me. What? Even if we only have enough money to get by, I'd be happy enough. No kidding. I mean it. Are you Mrs. Nakahara? Yes, I am. We've been waiting for you. Thank you for picking me up. Tsuyama-san, where are we going? We are almost there. In fact, I think Nakahara is a nice guy. We need a man with backbone like him in Japan. But he was simply unlucky. I'm very sorry for him. He had luck with women, though. You are too good for him. Luck alone never brings you a woman. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean it. Talking about my husband's company... The food is good here, but there is another specialty. Let's talk after the show. The show? Tsuyama-san... Isn't this fabulous? Excuse me. Enjoy yourself, too. Why did you come to see me? You want to ask me something huh? Shit! I'm home. Would you like supper? I'll go to bed... Good night. "To: Sonoe Nakahara" "We'll be waiting for you. " Hi. What are you... Did you receive my letter? What's the idea? Well, this is my job. You need money? How much? I heard your husband's company is in danger. I don't want any money. I'm a stage director. I'm not pinched for money. You watched my show, didn't you? It's still going on. Let's go. I'll return all the pictures there. Don't worry. We promise you to return all the pictures. Have some tea. Now, Sonoe-san, let's get started. Stop it. Make up your mind. Your husband will be sad. I can take off my clothes. This is the sponsor of this show. Sonoe, look at me. No -! It's too late to refuse. Open your eyes. Look at me! This is the first time for her. Treat her nicely. Nakahara did it wrong. His selfishness ruined his life. I was wrong, too to follow such a guy this far. And you also... with such a guy. I love you, Sonoe... I decided to break down everything before Nakahara takes it all. The company will be gone anyway. G&C will acquire our company. Most of the employees would be laid off. Nakahara, too. Tsuyama and I decided that behind the scenes. I'll get a good position at G&C. Bringing you as a souvenir, I sold the company. What are you doing? I'm going... Where to? Where else can I go? Hey, look over there. Your pictures have been sent to Nakahara's PC. He must have been watching us. Nothing is left at your home. Leave us alone. I'll take you home. A stage director is very kind to an actress. I'm home. Hi. Seiji-san. My company will go bankrupt. I have huge losses. We can't live here anymore. I think you can start over again. Don't bullshit me. You're always like that. Yoshida beat me up completely... Since when did he plan this? Seiji-san, I... Sonoe, I don't want to see your face anymore. Get the hell out of here. Please hit me, if it will make you feel better. Shut up! Please hit me as much as you like. You can hit me as long as I live. Shut up! Get out of here right now! Seiji-san, I beg you. Let's start over... I can't! What are you thinking about? What the hell you think you did? Sonoe, you are a Libra, right? I read it in the horoscope. Today will be your best day ever. I'll be OK. Get out of here. Sonoe-san! Sonoe-san, I'm really impressed by you. I've never met a gem like you before. Do you see yourself? You're the real thing. Bound by me and attacked by Yoshida, you were feeling so well from inside, right? Your soul was trembling, right? Look at your eyes. So beautiful. You bow down and be humiliated, and you can be more beautiful. That's what you are. How do you feel? Don't you feel like the show is still continuing? Hello. Anything to drink? No thanks. I came here to pay for the show. How much in total? Etsuko, bring him the bill. How was it? Were you satisfied? Just let me pay the bill. Yoshida-san, I want to talk to you. Don't you think the show is still continuing? What are you talking about? Don't you think she is too good to let go? Why is she here? Well, even if you drop out, we'Iljust continue here. Don't bullshit me. Everything is over now. Nothing will happen anymore. We've had enough. Everybody went to hell already... Yoshida-san! Call the ambulance! Wait! What!? It's too late. Should we... call the police? Wait... Wait... Let Sonoe-san leave here first. Huh? Kill me... please... Please kill me... OK. I'll take care of you. Kill me... You have to learn howto make up, OK? You're like a coward outside the show. When I'm bound... Sorry? When I'm bound, I feel as if someone is holding me... What do you mean? That woman really changed. Her karma is stronger than any other woman's. You were freaked out, weren't you? Don't you bind your ex-girl anymore? I called it quits with her. Once you know Sonoe, no other woman will do. By the way, what happened to Sonoe's husband? He's running from stockholders and hiding somewhere. He may be hanging somewhere. The karma of a woman... Give it a try. I haven't seen him. What happened to him? What? Your cat. Everyone is coming into heat. Are you talking about Sonoe-san? Hey, are you jealous? I don't think she's good for this job. Bullshit. No other woman can enjoy such humiliation. You don't know anything about women. A woman's heart and body are different. You know, body soon dominates heart. I've been looking for you, Nakahara-kun. No hard feelings, you and me. You understand, right? To celebrate your new life, I will show you something special. Attention please. This is a special day. You, come here. I'll teach you how, please bind her up. Go on. That's her joy. More tightly! It's strange... She should have been screaming by this time. Please fondle her more. Please let the guests listen to her scream. Everybody, please listen to her. I spotted you right away. As a matter of fact, this man is a very special person to her. I've been waiting for you. She never wants to be seen by this man... in such a humiliating way! Hold me tight. Sonoe... More tightly... I've been waiting for you for a long time. What're you saying? Stop it, you bastard! You should be dead! Etsuko, give me the knife! This is ridiculous... Stop it! Don't get me wrong. The game is over. Don't show me this farce anymore. You guys can go anywhere! Because I'm... your wife, Seiji-san.
