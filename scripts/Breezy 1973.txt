All I need is enough for some coffee. Can't start the day without that first shot of caffeine... (LAUGHING) Hey, listen... (STRUGGLING) I really wanna thank you again for last night, Bruno. I mean, if it hadn't have been for you, I would've drowned in all that rain. Mmm. What the hell am I supposed to do with a quarter? Um, I don't know. Live it up. Carpet the place. BRUNO: Hey, hey. Uh, what's your name? Breezy. See ya around. WOMAN: (SINGING) The morning is a friend of mine It always plays my song And anytime I ask the wind It lets me tag along I read the lessons in the leaves They've a world of things to tell me I always keep my pockets filled With pumpkin seeds and thyme I have no secrets from the sun And I'll have none from you And if you're going to the fair I'll walk along with you The day is shining in our heads Like a dime to spend together And we can talk of many things Of cabbages and life Maybe we'll make each other laugh And maybe we will cry And maybe we'll be each other's friend Before we say Good-bye Hi, I'm going to the Valley. Yeah, hop in. (DOOR CLOSING) I picked up this chick once. It was a gas what she'd do for $5. Why are you turning here? I thought I told you I was going into the Valley. Hey, relax. I dig you hippie-dippys. I really do. Uh, I think... I think you better let me out here, mister. There was another broad. She was hitchhiking down the Sunset. Man, she wasn't in the car two minutes and she asked me for $20. She says, "You give me $20, or I'll yell rape the next cop we pass." (CHUCKLING) You know what I did? I gave her something to yell about and threw her out of the car. (LAUGHING) (HORN HONKING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (TIRES SQUEALING) (SIGHING) Freaks. Another typical day in the life of Miss Dum-Dum. Taxi! Uh, the lady will be right out. That should take care of it. TAXI DRIVER: Thank you. I, uh, took care of the cab. I don't know why it is, but the morning after I always feel that everybody knows what I've done the night before. When it's me that has to get dressed and go home. Oh, well, the hell with it. (SIGHING) Did I remember to tell you I had a wonderful time? Well, so did I. Frank, am I going to see you again? Well, yeah, sure. I'll, uh... I'll call you sometime this week. I don't think you have my phone number. We'll remedy that right now. Uh, 724-8122. And maybe you oughta take my service... My answering service. U h, that's 722-2000. Bye. (PANTING) Who says a rolling stone gathers no nails? Boy, am I glad to see you. I didn't think anyone was alive up here. You going down the hill? Well, yes, but, uh... Far out. Ooh! Miss, uh, I don't pick up hitchhikers. That's the best news I've heard all day. (ENGINE STARTING) And then he says, "So I really gave her something to yell about, "and I threw her out of the car." Well, finally, we had to stop for another car. Boy, I opened the door, I started running. I never knew I could run so fast. Well, anyway, that's how we ended up in front of your place. I guess it seems really stupid that I should be taking a ride from another stranger after something like that. But, hell, you can't start suspecting everybody because of one poor nut. Besides, you're better looking than he was. No, I think it's true. I think people are basically good. Now, you take Bruno, for instance. There I was last night in all that rain with no place to sleep. Marcy's house was full up. I mean, there wasn't even an inch of floor space left, and so Bruno, who didn't know me from Adam... Or Eve. Well, Bruno took me home to his place. He didn't have any toothpaste though, and my mouth feels like somebody walked through it with their shoes on. Doesn't it bother you discussing all of this in front of a perfect stranger? Are you perfect? May I? Aren't you a bit young to be smoking? If age has anything to do with it, then you're the one who shouldn't be smoking. It's harder on older people, you know. At least that's what they say. Are you married? No, uh, there's very little call these days for old, decrepit, one-foot-in-the-g rave smokers. That's too bad. You know, you really should be in that big, nice house and all. I mean, it must get really lonely rattling around in it all by yourself. I like being alone. Oh, I don't. I dig people too much to be without them. But then, that's the trouble today. People just don't like each other anymore. Do you think God is dead? What? God. Do you think he's dead? Didn't even know he was sick. You know what I think, and I've been giving it a lot of thought lately. I don't know if I can actually buy the fact that there's somebody up there. I mean, somebody up there. No. No. I've come to the conclusion it's a lot simpler than that. Know what I mean? No. I mean, say... Say God is, oh, the conscience of man. Wouldn't that scare the hell out of you? Well, sure, because if that's what he really is, well, then maybe he really is dying. Here we are, Laurel Canyon. Ah, we made it. (CHUCKLING) Laurel Canyon. You said you were going to the Valley. I'm going into Hollywood. Okay. Okay, what? Okay, Hollywood's fine with me. Say, I got a great idea. Why don't we stop at a coffee shop? We can continue talking. You know, I really like talking with you. You certainly know how to shovel it, don't you? Huh? You're broke, right? And you want some coffee, right? Only coffee turns out to be a full-course meal. And the great conversationalist over here, that's me, winds up picking up the tab. Then if things go according to plan, and you butter me up, I'm supposed to lay a few bucks on you to see you through the day. Wow, if you haven't got the most suspicious, rancid mind. Oh, I know, and I hate myself for it. Tell me, uh, does that routine usually work? Nine times out of ten. (GIGGLING) Hey, wait a minute. Slow down. Wait. Hey, there's a dog in the gutter. Stop the car! I can't stop for a dog. Well, then let me out. Just let me out. (TIRES SQUEALING) Damn it! Do you think he's in pain? (SIGHING) What does it matter anyway? I mean, he's just a dog, right? Just a dumb, stupid, beat-up dog. - Come on. - Just let me go! Why don't you go? That's what you wanna do, isn't it? Look, you can't do anything for him, he's dead. What happened? Oh, somebody ran over a dog. MAN: Oh, yeah. Somebody ran over a dog. Well, wait a minute. You don't think that... (DOG WHIMPERING) (WHIMPERING) Oh, great. Just great. Morning, love. Hi, Sam. Frank. These are the keys to the Everett house. Oh. Oops, how much? Uh, 95, but they'll settle for 88. I'll take a look at it. 12:30, right? I know you thought I forgot. Now let that be a lesson to you. Okay. Oh, listen. One thing. Uh, can we make a stop on the way to lunch? There's a listing I wanna take a look at. All right. Bye, then. It looks marvelous. FRANK: Let's see. It's nice. You know, with a little extra effort on my part... Well, I mean... If I really worked at it, I suppose I could be hysterically happy in a house like this. (KEYS CLACKING) Let's take the grand tour. (GIGGLING) I wish you could've made it last night. It was a lovely party. Well, if it's any consolation, I had a lousy time last night. Well, whose fault is that? Didn't I always tell you don't go to strangers? Did I do something to earn that, or is that just an impulse? Consider it a loan. You can pay me back with interest later. Oh. Mmm. How much is this house? $95,000. What did they say they'd settle for? Oh, 88, probably. Why? Because I might be able to throw a little business your way, if you have no objections to making a big commission. Darling, I'd sell you an outhouse if I thought it would put a buck in my pocket. Now there's the bastard I know and love. Do you remember Charlie Eisen? Bob and Nancy introduced him to us. Yeah, he's a lawyer, isn't he? Yeah. He might be interested in this house. He was at the party last night, and it seems as though he's planning on getting married. Hmm. Sounds like he's doing okay. Who's the lucky girl? Me. How long have you been seeing him? Oh, whenever you couldn't make it, which adds up to quite a bit of time. I don't think I like the idea of losing you. No, I just think you don't like the idea of losing, that's all. (CHUCKLING) Would you care for cocktails? Yes. Two very dry vodka martinis. If that's all, then what's been going on for the last six months? (CHUCKLING) Not very much. Don't you remember? No strings? No ties? No great need for each other? Those were your rules. Bless your heart, you kept every one of them. But I broke them all. Anyway, you might remember that for next time. Anytime a girl agrees to an arrangement like that, she's already in love with you. It's just a question of appetite. Crumbs or no cake at all. I don't know what to say. Well, I guess that says it all. Let's order. (DOORBELL CHIMING) It's all I own. I had to come for it. Right over there. I know it's not a very good one, but then, I don't play it very well either. Hey, am I interrupting anything? I mean, are you alone? "Yes" to the first question and "not anymore" to the second one. Good. This is a really nice place. Comfortable? Oh, yeah. This couch is great. Wow, you have a fireplace! I love fireplaces. Does it work? Yes, it works. We used to have one back home, but it was a phony, you know, electric. You had to plug it in. I'd like to play host, but I have some work to do. Oh! Don't let me bother you. Go right ahead. No, no, no. Really. I don't mind. Gee, if I had a fireplace, I'd keep it lit all the time. Your name's Frank, right? Frank Harmon. I, uh... I saw it on your mailbox. My name's Breezy. Why isn't it lit? Uh, I don't know. I didn't see any reason to. You're sure you don't mind? No, no, no. (CHUCKLING) Say, I was wondering, you wouldn't have anything to eat, oh, like an apple? How about an apple? Okay. What happened? You didn't score today? No, no, no. Don't get nasty or I might leave. (CHUCKLING) Come on. I don't know. Maybe it's a special talent, but I'm forever finding things. People, animals. I found this cat once, and I took him with me wherever I would go. But I ran out of money. I couldn't afford to feed him anymore, and he ran away. I know it must be a painful subject, but, uh, have you ever considered getting a job? Sure, I've had all kinds of jobs. Let's see, I was a waitress a few times. I worked at a department store in the bargain basement, and I even sold pots and pans door to door. May I have some more milk? Please? You think I'm some kind of bum or something? Is that why you asked me about getting a job? Well, if you're old enough to be on your own, you oughta be mature enough to work. (GIGGLING) Where did you read that? (SIGHING) (RADIO SWITCHING ON) (SLOW ROCK PLAYING) Paula Harmon. Is she a relative? My ex-wife. You send her money? No. Blood. She gets me for a quart a month. Is she pretty? I used to think so. How old is she? She's 39, but you'd have to stretch her on the rack to get her to admit it. (LAUGHING) 39. What does she do? What do you mean, "What does she do?" Does she work? What does she do for a living? Nothing, and she's exceedingly good at it. Where's all this going? I don't know. Just seems to me that 39 is certainly mature enough to work. Gee, I just love your house. Do you mind if I look around? You can, uh, search me before I leave. Go look. BREEZY: Oh! I don't believe it! It's beautiful! Oh, my God. I've never seen anything like it! BREEZY: This is too much! I mean, it is too much! I don't believe it. I have never seen a shower like this. This is a shower, isn't it? I mean, it's so big! Oh, Frankie, can I? (CLICKING TONGUE) Help yourself. Oh. You know, this is like a page out of House Beautiful. You're a fake, you know it? You try very hard to be mean, but... (UNZIPPING BOOT) You're actually very nice. What makes you think I'm doing you a favor? I'm probably doing a service for the board of health. Now there you go again. (WATER RUNNING) Thank you. That was wonderful. What are you anyway? I'm clean, for one thing. What are you? Nobody's fool, sweetheart. I thought I made that clear, but you do keep trying. Now look, get your clothes on. The party's over. You can go and play your little games with Bruno and all those other nice guys that you know. Does it follow you around all the time? What? That black cloud over your head. And for your information, Bruno is a nice guy. You don't really believe that? Mmm-hmm. You needed a place to sleep, and Bruno wanted to get laid. He charged you for that bed and you overpaid. So don't pin any medals on that creep for his generosity. You just keep mixing me up. First you're angry because you think I'm trying to take advantage of you. And now you're angry because you think I let Bruno take advantage of me. Well, which is it? Which am I? Am I the dum-dum that got taken last night or the bitch who's trying to take you tonight? I just wish that you'd make up your rancid mind. (SIGHING) You gave me a ride down the hill today. And whether you like it or not, that makes you a nice guy in my book. I gave you a ride because I didn't want to leave you hanging around my house. Sure don't make it easy, do you? I straightened up the bathroom. I washed out the basin so you could pretend that I'd never been here if you want. Where are you going? I mean, it's raining. That should please the board of health. - Look, Breezy... - Okay. So maybe I did need a place to sleep tonight. But you're not the only person I know. I just thought it would be nice to stay here with you. But I'll tell you something, I never woke up in the morning and had to look at someone that made me sorry that I was there. But I bet you have. I just bet you have. (SIGHING) I know you'd expected 80,000, Mr. Howard, but 75 was as high as they'd go. Even for Masterpiece Properties. (CHUCKLING) Look, uh, why don't you think it over for a couple of days. Yes, sir, this is the age of the ugly. FRANK: That's fine, Mr. Howard. Yes. Thank you, sir. Or how about, the era of the unwashed? SAM: What's that look like to you? Low tide? SAM: (CHUCKLING) That's beautiful. I gotta tell that to Mort. "Low tide." That's beautiful. Scotch and water, please. Thank you. Always around when I need you. Frank. No, it's just that when I am around you think you do need me. Anybody could substitute. Bet, what if I love you? Oh, don't, Frank. Don't be that cruel. Charlie, you know Frank Harmon? Oh, sorry. Took your place. Oh, no, no, no. Stay. Of course, uh, real estate. Right. Say, uh, Betty tells me you have a house for sale that we might be interested in. It's pretty steep, Charlie, uh, 95,000. That is steep. Maybe they'd come down a little. I don't know, they're pretty determined. I'm very tired, darling. Can we go? Sure, uh, can we give you a lift, Frank? No, thanks. I just had one. Come on, Charlie. (SIGHING) (DOORBELL CHIMING) - Mr. Frank Harmon? - Yes. You know an Edith Alice Breezerman? A what? That's the name she gave us. Edith Alice Breezerman. Uh, yes. Her name's Breezy. Then she is your niece, Mr. Harmon? My, uh... Yes, my niece... - (CLEARING THROAT) - Okay. We found her wandering up here in the hills. She told us she'd had a fight with you and was afraid to come home. Yeah, well, uh... I believe in a firm hand, Mr. Harmon, but kids shouldn't be afraid to come home. Well, if it isn't Edith Alice Breezerman come to call. (SIGHING) Jesus, right away nasty. Want an apple? Well... Come on. BREEZY: Gee, I'm really glad you didn't mind, about the cops, I mean. I had to tell them something, or they would've taken me all the way down to Juvenile Hall. Well, look, it could've been worse. Just think if you had to come all way down there. Lookit, I saved you a trip. What makes you think I'd come? I just think so. I'd like to reassure you, but I'm not sure myself. So let's don't put that to a test. Let's see what we got here. I'm not really hungry. Just an apple is enough. An apple. Except, uh... What? Well, there is something else I want. What? Oh, Frankie, wanna do me the biggest favor in the whole world? How big? Take me to see the ocean. Atlantic or Pacific? I've been in California for three months now, and I've never seen one. Breezy, it's 4:30 in the morning. But, it's Sunday, you don't have to work. Besides, it's too dark to see anything anyway. It's not just down the street, you know? By the time I got my clothes on, we got down there, - the sun would be coming up... - Yeah! BOTH: And then it wouldn't be too dark to see. I'll get my clothes on. Frankie. I know that you would've come to Juvenile Hall. I don't care what you say. I know that you would've come for me. Eat your apple. FRANK: All right, get ready. Close your eyes. Now open 'em. BREEZY: Oh, my... It's beautiful! (HORN HONKING) WOMAN: (SINGING) The morning is a friend of mine It always plays my song And any time I ask the wind It lets me tag along I read the lessons in the leaves They've a world of things to tell me I always keep my pockets filled With pumpkin seeds and thyme BREEZY: Are we almost home? Yes. Hey, there's Bruno! Which one? BREEZY: The one with the dark hair. Hey, Bruno! Hey, I went to the beach. I saw the ocean! Oh, yeah. Fantastic. Who was that? I don't know. (SIGHING) (CHUCKLING) I knew you'd chicken out. (CHUCKLING) Go to sleep. Frankie... Would you mind very much if I love you? I wouldn't let it get in your way or anything. And I wouldn't expect you to feel anything back. I just would like to be able to say the words once in a while. Breezy... (SIGHING) All this love that you give away, just once, wouldn't you like to have it returned? Don't you ever want to be loved back? I thought I was. (WHISPERING) I love you. I love you. I love you. (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? Hello. Yeah. Oh, that's great. Just great. Sure. I'll see you this afternoon. Listen, there's somebody I'd like to bring along, but I want it to be a surprise for him. Okay, fine. See you. Anything else? Uh, just a refill, please. That bitch wouldn't smile with a coat hanger in her mouth. (LAUGHING) Hey, Al's got a great new tape deck. You wanna go over there and listen to some music? Oh, I can't. I promised Roy I'd help him move. Who's he moving with? In with me, of course. I mean, you think I'd lift my finger any other way? BREEZY: I thought he had a girl. Well, I finally convinced him that these mixed marriages just never work out. (LAUGHING) Keep smiling, okay? - Okay. See you later, Norman. - Bye. How about you, Marcy? You wanna come? I'm supposed to meet Davey here. Well, the kids could tell him where you went. Well, you know how Davey is. He gets pissed off if I'm not where I'm supposed to be. Yeah. Well, that's love, I guess. Yeah. Hey, Breezy, you got somebody? Yeah. His name's Frankie. - Do I know him? - No. He's a loner. He kind of keeps to himself a lot. Is... Is he nice? Oh, he pretends awfully hard not to be, but, uh... Yeah, he's nice. I don't know. Sometimes... Sometimes he tries to be really rotten. But then he'll turn around and he'll do something that's really nice. You know, he gave me an ocean. Wow. Nobody ever gave me one. (LAUGHING) Drink our coffee. Look at this, will ya? Here am I killing myself, and for what? To help you keep in shape. Boy, other guys call me, you know? They say, "Bob, how about a drink?" And we go to a bar. They say, "Bob, how about lunch?" We spend an hour or two in a restaurant. But with you it's always tennis courts and steam rooms. That's gotta mean something, Frank. It means I don't wanna be seen in public with you. I'll wear a bag over my head. Can we have a drink now before I drop dead right here? You're just out of shape, buddy. I was never in shape. If it doesn't bother me, why the hell should it bother you? Doesn't bother me a bit. Oh, when we get inside, remember the bag over your head. (LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY) Sure, I thought about it. Hell, that's my chronic complaint every time we talk. (CHUCKLING) The excitement's over. Yes, my wife just doesn't turn me on like she used to. Well, you know. You start wondering what it would be like to meet somebody new. Fall in love. To feel all that again. 'Cause that's not all dead inside me, Frank. That's all still there. All the butterflies. (LAUGHING) You know what stops me? Fear. Oh, yeah. Scares the hell out of me. At my age, the thought of having to start all over again. Come on like I was 20. Doing all those numbers just to get laid. And then maybe being put down. Me? I'd end up paying for it just to make sure. No. I gotta know she's there. But you see, that's where you and I are so different. You dig being up on that hill alone. You really dig it. Me, I'd go nuts if I had to come home to an empty house. Tell me something, Frank. Don't you ever get lonely up there? I don't think I know what loneliness is. If I ever did, I've forgotten it. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) (CAR DOOR OPENING) Well, Edith Alice, for a man who likes his privacy and a girl without means of transportation, we're sure seeing a lot of each other. Oh, I just happened to be in the neighborhood. I must say one thing for your timing. What? It stinks. I'm going out tonight. Okay, here's one. "Housemaid. "Two swinging bachelors want swinging "housekeeper for oceanfront home. "Lots of leisure time for right pretty girl." How's that sound? - Okay, if you don't mind sand in your bed. - (CHUCKLING) Okay. "Handsome, well-endowed male desires equally gifted female "who has taste for the unusual." Hmm, "well-endowed male." Better jot that number down. - Here's a pencil. - (CHUCKLING) Okay. "Married woman with afternoons free "desires attractive, discreet man for daytime pleasure. "Phone: 270-5095." 2700... What? 5095. Gotta remember that one. I wish you didn't have to go. Some friends of mine bought a house. I promised to take the papers over tonight. Can't you do it tomorrow? No, they're leaving on their honeymoon. Got married today. Well, I might as well drive down with you then when you go. Nice of you to tell me. Last time you left without a word. Well, I didn't want you to wake up and be sorry that I was there. You don't have to leave. You sure you don't mind about me waiting up for you? No. It's a good idea. Give me an excuse to leave early. You know what I think I'll do? First I'll take a shower, and then I'll light a fire in the fireplace, and then maybe I'll make some coffee, so there'll be coffee when you come home, okay? Mmm-hmm. And then maybe... Maybe we can listen to some music on the stereo, or watch some TV! Okay? So you think a few hours. Around 10:00? - Yeah. - Okay. Around 10:00. (BREEZY CHUCKLING) Bye. Then we'll just settle in. WOMAN 1: But one week! What kind of a honeymoon is that? WOMAN 2: What a shame! Well, it just can't be helped. Charlie has to be in court on Monday. WOMAN 1: He's a nice guy, Betty. Yes, I know. He sure is. BOB: You might get a slight toxic effect. Hey! BETTY: You're all alone. (BIG BAND PLAYING) BOB: The first thing we know, they're gettin' married! Hell, I didn't even know they were goin' together. Surprised a lot of people. - Yeah. Bet it set you on your ass, old buddy. - (STIRRING DRINK) Here. Try that one. - Perfect. - Really? Let me taste that. It's a little heavy on the paint thinner. Nancy, what a relief! What are you up to? Up to here with him. Do you have to sample everybody's drink? He's just gonna be hanging over the toilet at 4:00 in the morning. What are you talkin' about? I know my limit. Oh, sure you do, honey. You passed it often enough. Speaking of bitches, Iran into your ex-wife last week. I hope you were in your car, going 80. Nice. Very nice. Uh, listen, when you're through poisoning our friends, do you mind giving me a hand serving? What am I, a slave around here? You said it. Hey, Frank. If you want another drink, the good stuff is underneath the bar. Thanks. I'll stick with the paint thinner. Hey, it's only 11:30. That's the third time you've looked. - Got an early day tomorrow. (CHUCKLING) - Oh. I, um, feel a terrible sense of loss. I wish it could have been more. It was. I just wish you could have been there. (SIGHING) Well. Bye, love. Bye. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Breezy! (WHISPERING) Make love with me. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHING) (SNIFFING) - Good morning. - Good morning. Is that all of you in there, or are you expecting company? Something smells good. Always does when it's burning. Hey, it's not there today. What's not there? The black cloud over your head. Goes away when I'm cooking. Now, look, sweetheart. Make yourself useful. Get the toast and the milk out of the refrigerator. And don't make any plans for today. Why? Are we gonna do something? Are we gonna do something? - What are we gonna do? - I'm not gonna tell you, it's a secret. Oh, that's not fair. I don't keep any secrets from you. Well... Everything about you is a secret. Breezy, I don't know one word about you. Where you come from? Who your friends are? Got any parents? Whether you're in trouble? You could tell me, you know? I didn't think you wanted to know. Gee, I'm no mystery, Frankie. I come from Intercourse, Pennsylvania... Yes, I know, and I've heard all the jokes. - (CHUCKLING) - I didn't say a word. Well, it gets better. You have to pass through Faithful to get there. Ooh! What a cross to bear. Oh. My parents are dead. They, uh... They were killed in an automobile accident. About five years ago. They were nice people. So, I moved in with my aunt... Thank you. And, uh, I stayed with her until I graduated high school, which was a year ago, and there didn't seem to be anything much holdin' me back, so I decided now is the time to move around and find out what was going on. Not much happens in Intercourse, you know. Really? So, uh, I put my guitar on my back, and I came to California. I love it here, don't you? This is where I met Marcy. She's my best friend. She has a house here in the canyon, too. She, uh... She keeps my guitar for me. Oh. Marcy takes drugs, though, uh, I wish she didn't. (SIGHING) Well, that's about it. I guess you expected something a little more sordid, huh? - Well, uh... - (CHUCKLING) Yes, you did. (LAUGHING) Well, maybe things'll pick up now that there's you. - Eat. - I am. - BREEZY: There it is. - Which one? BREEZY: The one that looks like the termites just ate it. (CHUCKLING) FRANK: And died of indigestion. (BREEZY CHUCKLING) Yeah. That's where Marcy and David live. He's waiting for you in Room Six. (DOG PANTING) You know what? I think I might love you till the day I die. (TEARFUL CHUCKLING) Quite a change from when you brought him in. (SEAGULLS CRYING) - Beautiful. - It's gorgeous. It's so... It's really bright, is what it... (GASPING) Mmm! Oh, goodness. Oh, I have it all over me. Here. I got it. Chicken. Behave yourself. Oh! - How pretty! - I like that one. Well, who wouldn't? (SIGHING) Come on. You kidding? You know how much that's gonna cost? Forget it. In my second life, I've planned to come back as Howard Hughes. The only problem is, he'd probably still be around, the character. - Don't you just love the smell of new clothes? - Mmm-hmm. Hello. Can I help you? Yes. She'd like to look at some things. All right. - What are you, a size five? About that? - BREEZY: Three, I think. WOMAN: Three? All right. Let's go over here and take a look. Pow! (GROANING) Got me, partner. (CHUCKLING) BREEZY: Ta-da! (CHUCKLING) Wha... What do you think? Oh! I feel beautiful! And you know where I see it? I see it in your eyes. Shall I put these in a bag for your daughter, sir? Why don't you, uh, throw those things in the wastebasket? No! They're still good. Here, I'll take them. Here you are. Thank you very much. - BREEZY: Oh! - FRANK: Come on! (DOG BARKING) BREEZY: Wait! Wait for me! BREEZY: Okay! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Fetch it, dog. Come on, fetch it! (GRUNTING) What the hell am I doing, chasing a nutsy dog? You're having fun, and so am I. Come here! Come on! (MAKES KISSING SOUNDS) Ooh. Come here. Come on! (KISSING SOUNDS) Come on. Come on. Isn't he a love? Ooh! You're just a love! Ooh! Yeah, lotta love. Lotta love. Love-A-Lot! That's perfect! That's his name. I now dub thee, "Sir Love-A-Lot!" (CHUCKLING) You're as nutsy as the dog. This is the best day of my whole life. You're too easy to please. I envy you. I love you. (CLICKING TONGUE) I'm more than twice your age, brat. Wonderful. You can count. You don't think that's important? I don't understand why people make such a big fuss about age. All it proves is that you've been here longer than I have. Got it all figured out, huh? No. No, I don't. I really won't know where older people are until... Until I'm there myself. Is that how it is, Frankie? Do... Do you start believing what you see in the mirror and forget about what you feel inside? Do you stop feeling because the outside of you makes it seem foolish? Is that it? Does becoming older mean feeling foolish? Well, what's there to look forward to, then, if you can't go on loving and being loved? I'm never gonna let it happen to me. No one should ever let it happen. Ooh, I love you so much. - (KISSING) - (CHUCKLING) (GIGGLING) MAN: Good evening. Got a nice, quiet booth somewhere? Yes, we do. Follow me. (FLAMENCO MUSIC PLAYING) No, I'm not much on blind dates, either. But what the hell? I don't get to LA that often. So the only people I really know out here are Bob and Nancy. Uh, would you get me another drink, please? Oh, yeah. Yeah. All you can hold. Uh, miss. Another round, please. Would you care for a cocktail first? Yes, we would. Does the young lady have her ID? What for? Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not allowed to serve liquor to anyone... I think you can safely assume that I'm aware of that. Of course, sir. Enjoy your dinner. This seems like a nice place. - (WATER POURING) - Yes, but I don't care much for the help. Hey. That was stupid, I'm sorry. That's his job, right? Right. Now, let's start over. Good evening. Would you care for a cocktail? Yes, vodka martini. And I'd like a Shirley Temple, please. WAITRESS: Thank you. Okay. This seems like a nice place. Have you been here before? Nope. I didn't think so. Less chance of running into somebody that you might know. (SIGHING) You know, you worry me. I do? Well, that's encouraging. Breezy, as bad as bad can be, you... You seem to find something good in it. You probably would have found some good in Attila the Hun. But, baby, there are things that are all bad. And there are people that are genuinely rotten. Unless you accept that, uh, you can't protect yourself from it. From what? Reality. Someday, reality's just gonna spring up and lay one on you. And I'm not so sure you can survive it. There's that black cloud again. - You don't hear me, do you? - Of course I do. I just wish that you could talk about something else. Like how wonderful today was. That was reality too. It really happened. I didn't dream that. No, you didn't dream it. Did you? Was it real for you, too? Sometimes, Edith Alice, you scare the hell out of me. Thank you. - (SIGHING DEEPLY) - Who knows? Maybe we'll get along. Stranger things have happened, you know? (CHUCKLING) Well, we're never gonna find out here, are we? So why don't we get outta here? Not yet. I have to stay a while. What for? I just have to. What do you want to do after dinner? Suggest something. We could go to the movies. If you like. We could go dancing. Fine. Could we just go home? If I don't hold you soon, or touch you, I think I'm gonna die. (SIGHING DEEPLY) Wow. You don't expect me to order anything now, do you? Feel it, Frankie. All the wild, wonderful things that are happening to us. I don't want to miss the smallest part of it. I can't stop shivering. Try. I am trying. Try harder, or we'll never get invited back here. Hello, Frank. Paula. How are you? Fine, and you? Oh, never better! I think your friend's growing a little impatient. Oh. He doesn't mind. Doesn't mind anything I do. (LAUGHING) The poor idiot's in love with me! Frank, I might be getting married again. He's asked me, but I... (SIGHING) I just can't make up my mind. Well, congratulations... If and when. I got your check. You're always right on time with the damn thing. I wish, for once, you could be just a little late, so I could call my lawyer and make some trouble for you. (LAUGHING) I'll see what I can do. (INHALING DEEPLY) Well, better go. Once again, it wasn't nice to see you. It was a pleasure not meeting you. God, you're young! (LAUGHING) Ah... Night, Frank. (SIGHING) Just what I needed. Cold shower. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Uh, what are you gonna have? Whatever. BREEZY: Oops. BREEZY: Okay, I'm gonna race ya? (BREEZY LAUGHING) - FRANK: Easy now. Let's not fall. - Oh, I know. Twelve Shirley Temples can really do it to you. (LAUGHING) Would you... (LAUGHING) (SIGHING) (BREATHING DEEPLY) I don't know when it happened. I just stopped loving her. All the things that I... Dug about her suddenly turned me off, and all the cute things became damned annoying. I should have left her then, but I didn't. So we kept torturing each other for a couple of years. "Mental cruelty." (SCOFFING) What an underrated phrase. We stripped each other of every honest emotion we had left. It became a challenge to see which one could force the other into the breaking point. (INHALING SHARPLY) I won. She finally divorced me. And now, she drinks me out of a bottle. I... My God, you're so new. I only have one appointment at the office this morning. When that's finished, I could come back. Then could we go to the ocean? I know a beautiful spot there. Like to show it to you. All morning long, from the moment I left the house, all I could think about was getting home. Not the clients, not the sales, not the commissions, I just wanted to get home. You're doing weird things to my mind, Edith Alice. I missed you too. You don't have to say anything. I told you before I didn't expect anything back. Besides, I know that you feel something. You couldn't have made love to me the way you did last night if you didn't feel something. I agree. Do you? What do you feel? Concern for another human being. An awareness of life. Fantastic excitement when I touch you. An interest... A genuine interest in someone other than myself. You feel all that for me? Yes. You love me. I didn't mention love. Yes, you did. (KIDS YELLING) I am going to have buttered popcorn. What about you? BOB: Hey! Frank! Over here! Frank! NANCY: Frank? FRANK: Oh, hiya, Bob. NANCY: You son of a gun. You didn't even say good-bye the other night. Okay. You don't deserve it, but I forgive you anyway. Thank you. Hey, you here alone? Come on in with us! Uh, no, I, uh... I'm not alone. BREEZY: I know what I'm gonna have. I want two Hershey bars, a Milky Way, and, um, a Butterfinger. Breezy, I want you to meet two old friends of mine, Nancy and Bob Henderson. - Hi. - And, uh... Oh! Bill and Rose Perry, Frank Harmon. Hello, Frank, how are ya? Uh, Breezy, right? Right. Well, we'd better be getting in. - A good idea. Come on, imbecile. - Yeah. See ya later, Breezy. Hey, meet us out here after the show. We'll go out for a drink someplace together. Klutz, come on. - Sure. Maybe. - A little later, then. I want one of these, and I want two, and a Hershey bar and Milk Duds. Why didn't... Why didn't you wait for your friends? You said that you would. No, I didn't. I said maybe. I thought that they were really nice. Friendly. Mmm. Too nice. Too friendly. Smug's more like it. Gee, I didn't think that they... How about a little quiet for a change? We don't have to talk every minute, do we? (SNIFFLING) - (SIGHING) - (SNIFFLING) Breezy? Don't let me hurt you. Don't let me do that. (SIGHING) I love you. I love you, I love you! I'm sorry. Is that better? I know I'm being a baby. So don't say anything. (CHUCKLING) I wouldn't think of it. No lectures on maturity, either. Not a word shall pass my lips. I'll let you in on a secret. Nobody matures. They just grow tired. You know, Davey and Marcy have been living together for almost six months now. But they don't have this. What we have. Davey tells her he loves her all the time. But... The words by themselves don't mean a hell of a lot. Marcy says that she loves him, but I think she has to say it, because... She doesn't realize how really alone she is. (SIGHING) Maybe sometimes it's better to be alone. Sure. (LAUGHING) Just like if you have something incurable, it's better to be dead. (LAUGHING) (CHUCKLING) - (WHINING) - Hello, Love-A-Lot. Speaking of incurables. (BREEZY LAUGHING) "Love-A-Lot." BREEZY: I like to watch you dress. FRANK: I like to watch you undress. You know what I love? Everything. - No, besides that. - What? (INHALING) I love being horizontal. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? No, I was expecting a call. Well, I've got three houses to show, and then, uh... Well, if you can make it at 2:00, you've got a deal. Why shouldn't I sound great? I am great. No, I'll tell you when I see you. Right. Bye-bye. Oh, I gotta get outta here. (SIGHING) I do not see the point of getting rid of a pot belly by replacing it with a rupture! (EXHALING) An affair, man. That's what I need. Someone to put the old zing back in my life. Something sick. (CHUCKLING) Oh, Jesus! Well, I don't mean sick. I mean, off-beat. Oh, Christ, if you're gonna cheat, what's the sense in cheating with the same kind of stuff you're cheatin' on, right? Right. Yeah, anything. - Yeah, you don't want to hear my problems. - Sure I do. You got problems of your own. Nope! Not a one. Not a one, huh? (SIGHING) Let's take a steam. I don't think I can stand it. Ah, do you good. Make you relaxed when you get back to the office. Relaxed? Are you kiddin'? I'll go back to the office and faint. You've been walking about two feet off the ground ever since we got here. It's nauseating, Frank. Are you gonna tell me about it? - What? - (SCOFFING) Boy, I wish I had your nerve. You're your own man, you know what I mean? I mean, you do what you want, you go where you like with anybody you please. You don't give a damn what people think. Now look at you. Look what it's done for you. It's that old zing, Frank. Yeah, that's what I need. Man, all the crazy young chicks today. Skirts up to their chins, no bras... (CHUCKLING) That's how I know I'm not dead. You known her long, Frank? - Who? - Who? That girl last night. Oh, boy. Can't you see me with a cute kid like that? Well... I just haven't got your nerve, Frank. Oh, there's a lot more involved than just your damn nerve. Sure, there's sex. What else, love? (SCOFFING) Why should a young girl like that love an old fart like me? Nah, I'd be a meal ticket for her, that's it. And even if I could, where would I go with her without feeling like a child molester? Ah, just hop into bed with her whenever I could get out of the house. Which is like once a year, on Arbor Day. And I'm not kiddin' myself, man. I'm in the panic years. Right now is the time I have to start proving I'm still the stud I ever was. Then, I can have my heart attack, relax, and not have to worry about proving anything anymore. Christ, can we get out of here now and go get a drink somewhere? My fingers are beginning to pucker. Frank? Yeah? I don't know what it is. Whenever I'm with you, I get diarrhea of the mouth. You shouldn't let me go on like that. And you had something you wanted to tell me, didn't you? (CHUCKLING) Uh, no. You said over the phone you had something you wanted to tell me. What was it? Nothing. Really nothing. - BREEZY: Frank! - (TIRES SCREECHING) (SIGHING) Damn! - Was that him? - Yes. I swear, sometimes he drives like a wild Indian. Even looks like an Indian sometimes when he gets mean. You know, his face gets all mean and hard and scrunched up. You didn't tell me that he was an Indian. I'm sorry. I thought I did. Now I see. (CHUCKLING) What do you see? That ocean he gave you was the Indian Ocean, right? (CHUCKLING) Right. (LAUGHING) (DOG BARKING) Get down, dog. BREEZY: I'm in the kitchen, Frankie. But don't come in unless your eyes are closed. I don't want you to peek. What is all this? You poop! I asked you not to look yet. Breezy, I've had a long day, and I don't feel like playing games. Now, what's going on? I just thought it would be nice if I had dinner ready for you when you came home. And, gee, that freezer of yours, Frankie. I've never seen so much food. Do you have to call me "Frankie"? It makes me feel like one of those unwashed idiots you hang out with. I didn't know. Um... I'm sorry. Uh... Anyway, uh, we're having hamburgers, and I make them a special way. With raw egg and bread crumbs and chopped onions. We're gonna have broccoli... FRANK: You should have waited. I'm going out to dinner. Got an engagement. Gee, uh... It seems a shame to waste all that food. Maybe we could save it for a midnight snack? Yeah, we could. Except, I don't know how late I'll be, or... Even if I'll come back tonight. Oh. That kind of engagement. Well, I've gotta shave. I'll miss you. (SIGHING) Maybe I should stay at Marcy's. Suit yourself. Or at Bruno's. It's your life. What happened, Frankie? Nothing happened. Then why are you throwing us away? Breezy, there's no "us." There never could be. Did you really think we could happen into something? (SIGHING) I thought we already had happened. All we add up to is a dirty joke. You're the zing in my life, and I'm the best score you probably ever made. That's all. You don't believe that. Okay. I can't cope with it! Let it go at that. I cannot cope with any of it. (BREATHING DEEPLY) I'm, uh... (SNIFFLING) I'm sorry about the mess in the kitchen, but... I don't think I can stay to clean it up. The food is good, though, so you might as well eat it. You have no reason to go out now. (DOG WHINING) (SIGHING) You keep the dog. (VOICE BREAKING) I couldn't afford to feed him, anyway. Will you do me one favor? Don't teach him to roll over and play dead. (WHINING) (SIGHING) (THUNDER BOOMING) (RAIN FALLING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Yeah, speaking. Who's this? Oh, my God! What hospital? Yeah, sure. I'll be right there. DOCTOR: Her arm is broken. She has a slight concussion. A few cuts and abrasions. But her injuries are comparatively minor, when you consider the incredibility of her being alive at all. DOCTOR: The man was killed instantly. From what I understand, the car was totally demolished. Now, don't be alarmed if she drifts off on you. She's heavily sedated. Thank you. (SOFTLY) Can't believe it. Can you? Can't believe it. I'm sorry, Bet. So very sorry. It happened so fast. (WHISPERING) Just riding along, singing. Laughing. Couple of nu... Nutty kids. All we could think about was going home. Spending our first night in our new home. I don't even remember what happened. A tire blew. And then we skidded. And hit something. Frank? Yes. Been lying here, just thinking. Trying to make some sense out of all this. All we really had was one week. But what a beautiful week. I've never been so loved. I was his first thought every morning, and his last thought every night. What chance did I have not to love him? And I told him so. I told him I loved him. And that's all that really counts. Nothing else matters. That's all. That's all there really is. Nothing else makes any sense. It's not fair. It's just not fair. (DOG BARKING) (BEEPING HORN) (DOG BARKING) Marcy? (SITAR MUSIC PLAYING) Are you Marcy? Breezy's friend? I'm not her friend. She told me you were. I... I hocked her guitar. Is that why you're crying? I'm crying because she forgave me. Where is she? They went to Plummer Park. I didn't go. Davey said I should wait here, and Davey gets pissed off if I'm not where I'm supposed to be. Hey. Are you the Indian? Name doesn't suit you at all. What's that? "Black Cloud." Thank you. Welcome. (LOVE-A-LOT WHINING) (WHINING CONTINUES) Hello! (WHINING) Hello, my love. Hello, my life. I don't know. If we're lucky, we might last a year. A year? Just... Just think of it, Frank... (LAUGHING) A whole year! WOMAN: (SINGING) Maybe we'll make each other laugh And maybe we will cry And maybe we'll be Each other's friend Before we say Good-bye
