Fall semester starts in two weeks. Think you'll be done in time, Professor Whelan? We're close. We're very close. Let me give you a hand. Oh, no. I'm fine. I thought it'd be a lot faster to box and store away all that old stuff. You know history. It always needs a lot of polishing. Good night. You have a good night. Santa Mira Archive Project Number B47305. Indian Head coin circa 1915. Condition, good. I just found Mesozoic era fossils of an Apatosaurus next to a series of thesis papers on Methuselah and we are one step closer to completion. Hey, guys. And two major steps back. Do they realize how far behind we actually are? I haven't told them yet. Well, then let's show the Dean this. Fossilized rat circa 1954. Very fine year for rats. Or rusty gauntlet. Gauntlet trumps rat. Scottish? Actually Irish. You can tell from the design. I'm thinking 12th century. Yeah. Can I? Just... Please. Thank you. This came with it, too. Oh! Great. Section three. Section three? Do we even have a section three? Oh! Yeah. Remember it had that musty old grandma smell. Maybe we missed something. Maybe we didn't. Look, I told my parents I'd come home and visit next week. Am I the only one that hasn't made plans once we're finished? We finish when we finish. You're gonna wear that thing all day, aren't you? Just come on over here. Jeez. How do you get used to being down here in the dark all day? How come you're late? Sorry. Hi, Ms. Whelan. Hello, Kurtis. You should probably go. See you tonight. I'll pick you up later, okay? Okay. So, what's the damage? You should go with Otto. What's section three? It's a lovely place. Nice decor. Wonderful aroma. Right this way. Always lift with the knees. Lift about 10 of these a day and you will be well on your way to the physique you see before you. Okay. Find this. Let's see. A red square? Could be anything. Could be a fully solved Rubik's Cube with the red side facing up. Could be a single tile from a checkerboard. Could be a metaphor for communism or it could symbolize guilt. I'll keep an open mind. Otto! The square is another room. Look out! Shayla! I'm okay. Wet and a little icky, but I'm good. What the hell happened? She found a false wall. It's not like I used a sledgehammer. It was already falling apart. How am I gonna explain this to the school? There's something back there. I thought that's... You're welcome. Shayla. That went well. I need more light. Hi. What? It's for protection. Well, I think we've found what we're looking for. You know what this means? Yup. We're dining in tonight. Burgers or Chinese? There's a similarity in craftsmanship. It's the emblem for the Irish Templar Knights. Interesting. What do you think is in it? Another box? There's some condensation. It's vibrating. I've never heard anything like it. Sounds like it's... Sounds like it's breathing. That's not funny. Listen to it. What the hell is that? I'm not sure. Could be bugs. Let's put a moratorium on the bug talk. Done with bugs, rodents, cardboard boxes and any Chinese mystery meat that attempts to impersonate sweet and sour. Rolling. Santa Mira Archive Project Number A2722. Condition, fair. Needs further restoration. We're attempting to open a metallic Irish box. Twelfth century. Possibly a relic of the Templar Knights. There's a strange vibration coming from it. We were led to it by a package containing a gauntlet, also from the same time period. Number A2723. Ready? Roger. We are looking at an unexplainable phenomenon. It appears to be a partially preserved, severed head. Maybe of a deformed person or a wild animal. Perhaps the metal box contained some sort of preservative presently unknown to us. Damn it! Perfect timing. Hello, Dean Harris. Funny that you should call. Yeah. No, no, no. I can handle that. Okay. This is freaky. What do you think? I don't know. There doesn't seem to be any decomposition. What the hell happened? Where's the head? It just exploded. Did you get it? Ah, damn. There doesn't seem to be any decomposition. I swear it opened its mouth. There's no return address. There's no way the school sent this to us. Well, there's gotta be a plausible explanation. Yeah, well, I think we ruled out the plausible the minute we opened the box. Maybe we should tell someone at the school. Tell them what happened. Tell them what, exactly? Yeah, they are gonna look at the mess in this classroom and listen to our crazy story and say, "We hired a bunch of crack whores. "Round up those crack whores. Take them to prison. " Because I'd believe that a meth lab exploded in here before I'd believe a story about an 800-year-old screaming head we found in a box. We gotta keep this under wraps until we figure it out. Shayla? Who was it? Nobody. I've felt, for some time, disconnected from those I once loved. My isolation, my silence, my beliefs, were routinely written off as madness. But my madness is not my affliction. Awareness is the curse that I've been saddled with. We didn't find a key for the casket. The apocalypse is coming. The Mayans were right. The harbinger of death is coming and will show no mercy. Are you listening? Ow. Ah, crap. You cheat, Idaho Commando. No blades, only guns. I will destroy you next time. Hey. Hey. You know, I'm a little too old to have a babysitter waiting up for me. No one's waiting up for you. I just... I couldn't sleep. You should go to bed. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Fine. Look. I'm sorry about the wall today. It's okay. Why don't you go to bed? I mean, you've gotta get sleep. You haven't even started packing your room yet. What was behind it anyway? Nothing. Why don't you ever tell me anything? I don't wanna fight. Yes, you do. All the time, actually. I can see it in the way you look at me. Why am I such a disappointment to you? Shayla, please. I don't wanna do this right now. You treat me like a child. You hate my boyfriend. You refuse to even have a simple conversation with him. And, you know, sometimes, I think you hate me, too, because I'm the only thing you have left of Dad! Shayla, I don't wanna get into this tonight. When are you going to stop blaming me? It's not my fault you weren't around when Dad died. Bad night? You, too? It's not surprising, considering. No. It was more than that. I kept hearing voices outside of my place all night. Giggling. Scratching. And it wasn't the storm. Something was trying to get in. It was taunting me. I kept trying to convince myself that it was my imagination getting the best of me. Do you want to see what my imagination did to me last night? Yikes. Then I guess it's a good thing I didn't go outside. Hey, guys. What's going on? Anything weird happened to you when you got home last night? Well, I was gutted to death in my Commie Commando game which is terribly strange, because the only weapons available are guns. My ear is still ringing and feeling scabby after last night. Mmm. Oh, there was a dead weasel on my front doorstep. Otherwise, feeling dandy. Oh, my God. Professor, what is going on? I looked up Broderick Duncan's name last night. He used to teach here. Retired 10 years ago. Then I found all these creepy videos. I know he's gotta have something to do with this. "I am not a god. I am not a man. "I am the bringer of darkness. "The great wielder of the truth. "Mankind has long suffered at the hands of mortals, "but I am the vessel for which mankind will bow "for its forgiveness and pay for its ultimate sin, "complacency. " On the one hand, he's an esteemed professor who retired with dignity, and on the other hand, he's an end-of-days prophet of doom. Sounds like psycho whackjob is a more appropriate description. Wait. Did you see that? Look familiar? The Templar seal. He's wearing my gauntlet. My? That's our connection. He has to have been the one who sent us the gauntlet and that led us directly to the box. What a prick. We have to find Broderick Duncan. Janie, where are the employee files kept? Section three. Not again! I really hate the smell down here. Hmm. I knew something didn't sound right. Assault charges. Erratic behavior. They offered him a deal. Retire gracefully and never come back. Doesn't have a current address. But he does have an assistant. Dr. Frederick Page. He was the one who got him fired. This guy was heavy into environmental causes. Left shortly after Duncan. Maybe he knows where he lives. Let's go. I'm right behind you. All right. Pete. Pete! Pete! Otto! Otto! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's going on? You didn't see it? We didn't see anything. We just heard you screaming. Are you all right? Clearly not. The police say it was a heart attack. What do you think it is? I think something else is going on. We looked everywhere. Nothing else was down there with you. What are you not telling us? In the '60s, the government tested hallucinogenic weapons. LSD was a by-product. Maybe something like that was released when the box was opened. You're thinking we're experiencing some sort of mass psychosis? Sioux wasn't even in the room when that thing evaporated into the air. How do you explain what happened to him? Did you find anything out on Page? I got an address. He lives in that new, downtown Eco-complex. Okay. I think I'll pay him a visit. Can I borrow the phone, the one with the recording? Yeah. Here. Just keep searching, okay? Okay. You know, when she's finished archiving this project, we'll be moving. She already has the next gig lined up for next month. How long have you known about this? Since we got into town. And you're just telling me now? I know. I'm sorry. You know... I just didn't know I'd like you this much. Okay. Right. I was thinking about staying. Just thinking? She'd never let me. I know her. She'd create some drama to make me go. Look, if you do leave, maybe I'll go where you go. Why should you have to follow me around? You know, my dad used to walk me down to skid row once a month. You know, he wanted to show me what life would be like if I didn't study hard. And? And... And I still got the lip ring anyway, chica. Look, everybody's got their own reasons for doing things. And sometimes they don't make any sense, like your mom, most of the time. But if this is how you feel, then I'll support whatever decision you make. Good, because I've already made up my mind. Oh. Hopefully she'll listen to me this time. What is the only thing you can break when you say its name? I don't feel like I owe anyone an apology. I am not crazy. I am not a lunatic. I just see the world for what it is. Among our ruins is justice. Judgment will be handed down. Bean Si. Bean Si? Is that Spanish for "Yes, I'd like some beans"? Bean Si. It's Gaelic for banshee. Irish folklore. A creature whose scream warns of imminent death. Banshees were associated with five royal Irish families up until about the 12th century. A banshee can take on many forms. The most common is that of an old hag. But there are also stories of people encountering a banshee as a waif or a seductress. And of course, if you heard the banshee's scream, it will haunt you until you accepted death. Otto. What? What's wrong? So much for the implausible. That's pretty much what I saw, but it had a body this time. I didn't see anything. Well, maybe it didn't want you to. I mean, it was toying with me, it was messing with my mind, it was trying to get me to... I don't know, it was tricking me into... Haunting you? Silence. That's it. That's what you break when you say it. That's what Duncan asked in his clip. When I didn't scream, that's what saved me. It couldn't hurt me. You're starting to freak me out. Starting? Can I help you? Uh, yes. My name is Professor Moira Whelan. Ah, you're with the school. What can I do for you? I only need a moment of your time. It's about Broderick Duncan. A box... They're still looking for that thing? No. We found it. Well, if that's the case, I'm sure you realized it couldn't be opened. It would be a good idea if you wouldn't... Well, you see, that's the problem. We did open it. No... Come in. Hey, guys. Where's my mom? She went out, but she'll be back. We'll wait. Is there anything I can do until then? You want to help? Yeah. As always, a little too late to do that. No, thank you. Does this look familiar to you? I don't recall Duncan or I ever finding anything quite like that. Mmm-hmm. Well, it was sent to us and it turned out to be the thing that opened the box. Hmm. Strange things have been happening ever since that box was opened. Some very wild and vivid hallucinations. Almost like there was some kind of chemical agent inside. Perhaps placed there by Duncan. My dear Professor. Broderick Duncan is a very intelligent man whose imagination was his own worst enemy. The Templar Box was just one in a long line of his many crusades. I'm not interested in any crusade, but this one. Where can I find Duncan? I've left that part of my life behind me. I didn't like who I became when I was around him. But I need you to tell me everything you know. Please. What's wrong? I'm just worried about you. Us. And that thing. It. And? And Sioux is dead and we both know it wasn't a heart attack. I just... I'm freaked out, I'm pretty... Pretty scared. Maybe... Maybe we should stick together tonight. Just in case. Otto. Yeah. Do you realize how pathetic you sound? Yeah. Very. And somehow it's the very reason I find myself attracted to you. And, so you don't want me to come in... No, no, I'm okay. Hey, but, maybe next time, I'll walk you home. All right. Twenty years ago, we went on an excavation, in these wedge caves. One in particular was called Labbacalle or Hag's Bed. During our dig, we found a cryptic map that was left to us by early settlers. Using the map, we went into some underground caverns. That's where we discovered an armory buried deep within the walls. Artifacts brought to America from Limerick City in Ireland. Then Duncan found that box. So he brought it back to the school? He was obsessed with opening it. That was one of the things that led to his dismissal. Why didn't he take it with him? Why bury it in the wall? I don't know. What did he think he'd find inside the box? He believed it was a weapon. And I'd like to know what he meant by that. Come on, please, pick up. Pick up. Hey, this is Otto. Sorry I missed you. Leave a message. Thanks. A head? That's what was in this box the entire time? We need to find Duncan and then I won't bother you again. Or you can tell me why your handwriting matches the handwriting on this map. When you asked me why Duncan didn't take the box with him, it was me, I was the one that buried it in the walls. To hide it from him! Why did you lead us to it? Oh, no, no, no, dear. I wasn't the one that sent you the gauntlet or the map. That was him. I'm sure of that. How did he know where it was? He always gets what he wants from me. I tell you, he lost touch with reality long ago. He's a very dangerous man. I'll take my chances. The Templar Box is Broderick Duncan's folly. When you go chasing windmills, all you end up doing is hurting the ones you love. Good day. No, no, this is your mom's classroom... ...an unexplainable phenomenon. It appears to be... Come on, Janie, pick up. Janie. Kurtis. What is your mom involved in? I want to go home. Janie. Janie. Janie! Janie! Janie! Janie! Something got to her. It tried to get to me earlier. It's the same thing that tried to get to you. Wasn't it? Yes. I think... I think it might be a banshee. Otto... You have any other theories? What did Page say? Not much. Janie called. Before... What did she say? I don't know. Where... Where is it? Come on. Come on, pick up. Pick up. It didn't kill her until she screamed. Why didn't you pick up? You could've helped her! I didn't hear it. This is your fault. Look, Otto... She's dead. Janie is dead. I don't want to hear you trying to rationalize this anymore. How are we going to stop this thing? What are you doing here? When you came by to see me earlier, part of me was excited that the mystery of opening up the box was finally going to be over. Then I realized something. I was going to have to see him again. Where is the box? If this was used to trap that thing before, then we could use it again somehow, correct? Only Duncan knows how all this works. Against my better judgment, we're going to have to pay him a visit. He started it. He's going to help us stop it. Shayla was here? Can you hear that? Uh-huh. Yeah? It's all yucky in there. Are you okay? Maybe you should blow in it again. You know, just to make sure. Wanna check my ears now? Kurtis? Shayla. Shayla. Shayla! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, my God. It was horrible. It was so real. It was so real. Because it was real. Oh, Shayla. Shayla. Mom! Mom... Mom, what the hell is going on? What are you looking for? Leverage. The Bean Si was persecuted like myself. It didn't have a choice. Its voice was silenced. Its cause, perverted. Common to royalty, hunted and pursued in an animalistic pursuit of power. Its crime? To ask royalty to bow, to submit to its cry. That's what I've been trying to say. The banshee screams because it wants you to scream. That's why you can't give in to it, give it what it wants. If you do that, it owns you. My tail is long, my coat is brown. I like the country, I like the town. I can live in a barn or live in a shed. And I come out to play when you are in bed. My tail is long, my coat is brown. I like the country, I like the town. Or live in a shed. And I come out to play... Mom, look out! Kurtis. We gotta get out. We gotta get out of the car. Shayla, get out of the car! Get her out. Get her out! Get her away! Kurtis. Kurtis! You gotta stay back. You can't do anything for him. No... Otto, get the cross! Okay. Hold her. I'm here. I'm here, Kurtis. I'm here. Keep Shayla safe. She's safe. It's okay. I'm here. Kurtis, I'm here, okay? It's okay. Kurtis. Kurtis! Professor, we got to go. We gotta get out. Go. Go. Get the gun. Get the gun. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. Let's go. It's okay. It's okay. Where are we going? We are so dead. Mom, please. We need to help him. This is crazy! Shut up! Doesn't anyone care? People are dying! I realize we're dealing with crazy. But the only hope we have of stopping this nightmare is with that professor up there. And if there's one chance of saving my baby, I'm taking it. I say we keep walking. Fine. Whatever. Are you sure he's here? Yeah, he's here. Broderick, dear. It's Frederick. You know what this is about. Open up. We know you're in there. My name is Professor Moira Whelan and I've got something of yours. I'm sure you'd like to know what was in it. You're gonna need this. What is this place anyway? His home. But he likes to call it Labbacalle. Open up, Broderick. Get down. Give me the cross. Give it to him! No! He'll kill us. Who's shooting? Run! Give me the cross! Get in! Oh, my God. This guy is a lunatic! He's going to kill us. You really think that's going to stop Old Man Crazy out there? Now you've heard the screams, you bastard. Home run, princess. Come on out. I mean all of you. I will splatter princess' brains all over the place. But I will negotiate. You must believe I was right, otherwise you wouldn't be here, would you? I was right. Tell me I was right. We're running out of time. I know you can stop this thing. Say it. "You were right, Duncan," and I'll consider it. Say it! You were right. That's it? And I'm sorry. Good. I can stop it. But I will do it my way. Okay. Long ago, a Templar Knight, a prince with royal Irish blood, devised a way to trap a banshee's scream as a way to share it with his enemies. Enemies? He martyred himself to the curse. My main intent to lead you to my box, not as revenge, I was sending a message. Your message has already killed three people. Really? I hoped for more. But there's still time. What an exquisite design. But will it stop the banshee? Let's see. Run! Stop! So tell us how we trap something that isn't real? Very carefully. Over there. We found that when we found the box. Very good, Freddie boy. Very good. That's what makes it flesh. Then let's go. Kurtis. Kurtis. Wait. Shh. Sounds like it's coming from below. The cave. I told you. I'll follow you anywhere you go. No! Get away. This isn't happening. This isn't real. I know you want me to feel weak. You want me to feel old and wretched like you. You want to drive me insane. But I won't let you take me. And I won't let you get anyone else either. Shayla, don't move! Finally we meet face to face. Farewell, my lovely. That's enough out of you. Bitch. You did it. Yes, we did. We did. Where's the box? What is it that you can keep after giving it to someone else? The answer is your word and your word means shit.
