I'll get it myself. LiZard. What is it? Didn't you get a divorce... for only $999? Not that cheap. I'm in the process now. Don't know who the girl is after. Did you have any child? No, with no eXperience. I've though. For most time, the child belongs to mother. But once the kid turns 18, one can make one's decision. Your parents... Divorced. I thought you guys know each other. How old were you then? Is that hard on you? Unhappy. But if you guys have decided, you have to speak to your daughter. Don't be upset. Although we are not together, we still love you. Don't you think it's your fault. Work hard. That time... Did you parents say that to you? No but... I want them to say that though. My daughter was just 8 months old. She doesn't know. Honey... It's me. Let's start it over. What are you staring at? You are quite mature. At our age, most of the parents are separate. How weird? I wish our neXt generation wouldn't have this problem. I mean... The neXt generation... I wish to be... A famous car racer. I wish I could join the Monte Carlo once. Isn't that great? Is that funny? Mine is funnier. I wanted to be... Don't laugh. The Shaolin 18 Steel Men! You're so weird. Remember that old movie Shaolin 18 Steel Men? I really want to be like that. Because my dad was... One of them? Your dad is fabulous! Let's try it on? You want to see it? Yesh. Alright... I'm quite busy these days. I will show you one day. Good. Don't know whether that's a dream. I have always wanted... to go backpacking alone. Travel around the world. I wanna see all parts of the world. I've worked for 3 summers. I want to see 1-16 of the world... before the summer ends. You are not 20 yet but you're very mature. That makes us the best couple. Stop. Come on. Don't touch me. Really. So... what now? It's alright. I'll cool down. Cool down. Help! Hush... Do you want an ambulance? No, let me cool down. It's hard to fall in love with this type of man. I know why you like an uncle. Is that a compliment? Of course. Don't you pig out yourself. Why not? You won't look good on the evening gown. Well, you have to go to Taiwan for wedding pictures. You know, it's quite popular there. Really, I had it. It was okay. For babies, you gonna go to Bo Shit Hospital. My mom gave birth to me in that hospital. They give out milk for free. Really? Yes. And afterwards, you have to slim down. You know. It's not good to have a big butt. Where should I live? Kowloon Tong of course. Good schools are around. Very eXpensive though. Yes. I've to check it with Danny first. There is a good place. Where? North Point. The Hamburger Restaurant closed down. What does it have to do with me? And now changes into an elderly home. A great place for everlasting couples! That's good. It's roomy and all. Yes. Remember to bring your guy to visit us. No problem. I'll bring you soft drink. And fruit too. Good. Gifts. Sweet. Look at you. You're so hyper. Haven't you tried it? Hello? Could you please let me finish first? Okay. I've not fallen in love in 6 years. And it was very boring. Everything seems calm and peaceful. I didn't intrude your peace. Let me finish first. I'm not rich nor humorous. Why don't you get yourself another guy? Are you there still? I'm here. You wanna go on? I don't know when you will finish. We are not compatible. The beginning seems to be romantic. But you will regret later. No. Trust me, I will. Where is your self-confidence? Did I say anything wrong? No, you're right. Sorry. Don't call me anymore. Why? That's it between us. What? What? Hold on. I lost him. Just lost him. Get up. No need to be upset... Get another one. Your phone rings. Hold on. Hello? Wait. Come on... Sit tight. What is it? Are you free tonight? I want to see you. I am not free. Give me a reason. Because I want to. I want to see you. Are you sincere? I've to check with my secretary. Let me see my schedule first. I'm not going... I'll stay alright? I'm not going. Hey, I can't make it. My friend just had a break up. Can't you fiX it up later? I can't tomorrow either. Your friend just broke up? Let me help her. Let me comfort the lost lamb. You don't know her. It's alright. Let me talk to her. Alright, hold on. Come on. My friend wants to talk to you, do you mind? What is he saying? I can't hear. I said no. We are not going. I will go out for a while. You stay with me. Don't cry. You look terrible. Please, smile a bit. Isn't that great? We will talk and have some fun. You will sweat and charm those guys. Come and sleep at my place. When you wake up, you will forget all things. And start it all over again, alright? Hello. Is she your break-up friend? I will introduce you to my friends. He is my friend. She is my friend... This is for you. I was going to give it to her. But now, it'll be better for you. She just broke up. Have some fun with her. Have a seat. Sit down... Don't worry. If you over-comfort, she'll think that she is a pity and all. She will fiX it herself. Is that it? Do you want me to write it down? Good idea. You're pretty. An end entails a start. Don't think too much. Once tonight is over. Everything is fine again. Cheers! Fung, come here. I've something to show you, come on. Where is your Fung? He... bumped into his friends. Look how many girls are around him. Being with him isn't easy. He is nice to everyone. That causes lots of misunderstanding. Let's go to bathroom. Say something... You hear me? Does he treat you as his girl? I don't care as long as I have feelings for him. Be careful yourself. Don't dump in everything. It's alright. Let it be. Can I go now? Wait a bit more. Are you waiting for him? Don't be silly. He is toying you. Don't you think it's real. Are you teaching me now? How many times have you gone out? You said I am silly but you just broke up today. Don't pretend to be the counselor! As long as you know what you're doing is fine. If I broke up, I wouldn't cry in front of you, alright? Okay, bye. Have you liked me at all? Yes. How much? How should I answer it? Use your mouth. Or your eyes. Why did you kiss me that day? I didn't know. It has nothing to do with today. If everything has to be sorted out, there will be no fun. Did Kiki invite you to her birthday party? She really didn't? She is your good friend. She didn't invite you guys? Yes, she invited Gigi too. But Gigi asked me not to tell you. But I think that isn't every nice. What is it? Can I have Fung's address? No. You again? You again, no... It's me. You're so annoying! Yes, please give me his address. It's important. Please! Please! I beg you! Please... Please, there is no time. Give it to me. Please... I don't want to see you again! Thanks, bye! Hello? It's me. Hello What are you doing this Sunday? Driving school, what about you? Sunday is your birthday. Come along. I heard you have invited... Gigi and Mimi. I thought you forgot about me. What? You used to call me two weeks Before every birthday and ask me where I want to go. But you didn't this year. I thought you were staying with you guy. I know you will anyways. What? Break up? Well, you have never been with him really. That doesn't count as a break up though. That's right. My love story isn't like yours. Are you free that day? I'll try. Bye. Bye. Hi, Kammy Hi I'll call you. I'll call you. Kiki Choi! Kammy! Why are you crying? Nothing. Nothing? This is nothing? It just falls off like that. I will beat you up if you cry again! I will beat you up! How dare are you to call my full name! I like to though. Kiki Choi... Have you had enough? Don't push it. If you had enough, let's go. Are you Fung? Alright, stand still... Good. Happy Birthday! Thanks. Happy Birthday! Thanks... Thanks for joining Kiki's birthday party. Please scroll over and eat. Hi, what a coincidence! Yeah. What are you doing here? What are you doing? Why get the hot bun instead of the hotdog? I like buns. But you're eating biscuits! Oh, the Shaolin 18 stealman is here. What a loser. How dare is he to come! I didn't invite him. It must be dad. We will keep an eye on him. Stare at him. Are you going out with anyone? I know. I saw his girl. I asked you not to say it. It's alright. That is better. I'm not comfortable. He says it and I feel better. Do we know each other really? That looks a bit strange. I swear I won't tell who she is. But I wanna know why not you guys sitting together? Uncle, let's have a chat. Is his girlfriend Kiki? I swear I wouldn't tell. Don't ask. I know. Ask me... No! You know Kammy has been so down... because of you? You know how much she has cried for you? Madam, please! It's not your call! Please. No! Why date her if you don't like her? You don't have to tell me. I will speak a name and just tell me yes or no. Is that Kiki? Louis, don't do this to me. I have to protect my client. Why don't you tell me? I wanna... No! You say it. You're old enough to handle trivial stuff like this. What kind of man are you? You bastard. I think you are not responsible! You lay a hand on my daughter?! Irresponsible... Don't fight... Let's protect our angel! No... Don't you misunderstand LiZard! You jerk! Don't pull me... Don't help him! Danny didn't lay a hand on your daughter, only her friend. That's it. You swear not to say it! That's worth a punch too! I didn't. I didn't even kiss her. That's worse! Why not kiss her? You're indifferent, inhumane! Let him finish. Just eXplain yourself. I'm done. Dad, we don't welcome him. Ask him to leave! No way! Hand in the money first! Ours too! But I only had a bun. I will pay you. RelaX and love yourself. I am upset for not able to stay with you. But I can't afford To see you suffer either. Good! Good! Sorry. Give yourself more confidence. You can do it. Where are you going? Bathroom. Me too... Me too. Give yourself more confidence. You can do it. Give yourself more confidence. You can do it. Happy Birthday. What are you doing?
