And in second position? Coffin-maker? l can't remember. The other nine were of no importance. Watch out! When it comes back, you have to duck! Beautiful flight. Wow, grandpa! Straight into the kitchen window! Try to play! lt's like a real piano! Did you say "thank you"? Thanks. The boy needs a real piano. Mum, when do l get a real piano? Vitus, get dressed, we have to go! You'll have to ask your dad. Dad, when do l get a piano? You'll have to ask your godmother. Watch out, don't touch anything! This thing can hear five times better than the human ear. - Bats can hear ten times better... - Yeah? Really!? Put these on. - l hear even less now. - Wait a minute... You're right, there are no batteries. But when this thing is finished... Everything will be put into a microchip, which will be built into this thing here. Then you'll hear as well as a cat. l'm going to call it "Cat-Ear". - Actually, "Bat-Ear" would be better... - l would like that too. Talking about "Bat-Ear", l've got something for you. And in fact, it works. Press here and it lights up. Look at the red light. There are two little microphones. And then this... Now you can hear like a bat. Come to the window. lt's great, isn't it? "l wouldn't do that Olga. Soon he'll be telling you what to do." - Vitus, hurry up and get dressed! - Actually, l'll need that back.. - When's your appointment? - Not till the afternoon. - Damn, l can't find my transparencies. - Does this have to happen now? - lt's a paradox! - No. lt's typical... Dad, what does "paradox'' mean? ''Paradox" means... - l'll tell you later. - But l want to know now. - 2 minutes. - OK, 2 minutes. Just a quick question. Could l work 70 percent instead of 30? - OK, but what about Vitus? - We have a very expensive child. We have a babysitter now, the daughter of our gem. Monti's daughter? Great. No wonder a lot of people would rather do without a hearing aid... ...and give up some quality of life instead of carrying a snail-shell behind their ears. You know that we generate 90 percent of our turnover with these "snails". l know that, but if Phonaxis wants to become a global player... Young people should wear our hearing aids as fashion items then? Maybe in fluorescent colours? Yes, that's exactly what l think. We have to beat the competition, which isn't sleeping either... ...with highly intelligent and pretty hearing computers. That means: Don't hide your hearing aid, but show it off. And present it like jewellery. On the table you can see my prototypes: The "Cat-Ear" and the "Bat-Ear". The design might need a few changes, but this is all about the idea, isn't it? Sounds like you want to lead the project yourself. That's exactly what l think. - Why should l believe in you? - You even dropped out of university! Because otherwise, l'll go to the competition. - Thanks for the presentation. - You'll be hearing from us. The other day he read about global warming to the children. He told them they would all die. The children started to cry. And then l get phone calls from the parents... Why don't you get Vitus to read "The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids" to them? Actually, that's my job. Vitus should be at school. Not kindergarten. And besides, he's very cheeky. lnstead of Mrs. Pfenninger, he calls me "Obelix". But that's a compliment. He loves Obelix. l'll take him with me. Vitus. Come on, let's go. - Bye Obelix. - Bye. - l'll think about your problem. Eat it before it goes all soggy. - l love you. - l know. Don't wipe off the lipstick... ...so that people can see you're taken. - Bye, Vitus. - Bye. - See you in the foyer at 7.30. - You don't have to go to kindergarten anymore. - Cool. Whilst l'm at work, a babysitter will come look after you. - But l'm not a baby. - Then just call her a girlfriend. lsabel is coming tonight. We're going to a concert, OK? l have to practise tonight. You can practise all day. - Can l? - Of course. Nobody has ever reached the top as fast as you have. - Hello, Mrs. von Holzen. - Call me Helen. Please come in. Vitus has a shower every evening. So now you know where to find everything. And once again, never disturb Vitus while he's practising, OK? Take care. Bye Vitus! - Vitus? - l'm reading. - Can l come in? - Be quiet. l want to read. Did you know that it was me who made the bat? l gave it to you for your first birthday. lt's called Abraham. That's a beautiful name. Oh my God, it's so big. Do you mind if we pick some flowers? lt's alright my little darling. l just need to pick some flowers. See? You just have to ask politely. Why are you picking flowers for my mother? Because she reminds me of your grandmother. Can you show me a photo of her? She was too beautiful for a photo. Oh no, we've just missed the train. We'll take the next one. The walls freshly painted. New furniture... Have you suddenly become rich? What do you mean by rich? Would you like to wear one of my suits? lf l'm not good enough for your dinner party feel free to cancel the invitation. - You've brought some lovely flowers. - Yes, they're from a very special shop. - You're even more charming than your son. - Well that's not really hard. - Where's Vitus? - ln his room. Are you getting dressed up? - l'm not into costume parties. - Let's get away grandpa. That's impossible. You're the host. Have a pleasant evening. - You have a nice place here. - A typical 1930's house. lt's going to be pulled down soon, that's why the rent is low. To go public at the right moment could be a stroke of genius. You want to go public with Phonaxis? l have a feeling that our "Cat-Ear" will attract a lot of speculators. lt's either boom, or bust. - l do feel optimistic. - But l'm still against going public. The stakes are too high. Mr. von Holzen, you are either our saviour... Or our ruin. l hope l'm not either of them. - Nick, take a look at that buffet! - Yes, just help yourself. Thanks, we know how it works. Why does he hate me? Because your wife is more beautiful. - True. - You'll talk him 'round. l'm not musical at all. My godson, however, is very musical. - Really? - Yes, it's incredible. That's interesting. My husband wanted to become a pianist. - Really. - lt was a long time ago. Oh, excuse me. Do you play the piano? - No, our son does. - Oh, a talented family. But surely not these difficult notes? Yes, he has a good teacher and he's been taking lessons for six months. For six months? You don't believe that yourself!? He doesn't play like a maestro. - Would you play something for us? - No. Come on, only one piece. We'd all be delighted. What does he play? Robert Schumann's "Wild Rider". What a sweet little chap! You can sense that he's musical. Beautiful... Extraordinary. A real wunderkind. l've never seen anything like it. He's only 6, but we do hope... Well, he didn't get it from me... They've told us that his IQ is so high it's incalculable. But l don't know much about it. l'm too stupid. l've been telling Leo that we are raising a real talent here. Do you remember the horoscope l did for Vitus? You carry a huge responsibility. Especially as his mother... lf you know what l mean? All of the world's great pianists... ...were so-called wunderkind in their childhood. No exception. You really have to foster his talents. The earlier the better. He should go straight to the conservatory. You don't just owe this to your son. But also to music. Now the world knows we have a real wunderkind. And a cheeky little monkey. Maybe Knaak was right. We have to foster his talents. What he doesn't learn now, he may never learn. We shouldn't put pressure on him. Otherwise he might do the opposite. lt won't work without a little pressure. Vitus needs that. Same as you. You're right in principle. But an academy is for adults. The boy doesn't even go to school yet. But didn't you... However, l have recognised his talent. We will accept him. Did you hear that, Vitus? l'll teach him myself. That's unbelievable! Thank you, very much. Are you a concert pianist yourself? He's in good hands with me. Are you happy, Vitus? Of course he'll keep on taking lessons. Just not with you, l'm afraid. You don't understand... Now listen! He's our son and you're just not good enough for him! And l'm sorry too, Mrs. Piantoni. Just send me the bill! Good bye, Mrs. Piantoni. Where is he by the way? ln his room. He doesn't want to eat. He wants to stay with Mrs. Piantoni. "l love her'', he said. l've got something for you. Come out here... Vitus, hold the spandrel. Why shouldn't it fly? You know a little about aerodynamics, don't you? The bulge creates an air cushion and it flies. All we need is some silky skin, like what bats have. Very good. Silky skin! Yes, silky skin... Do you want to learn how to saw? Come here, l'll show you. Hold here, and follow this line here. And now you. But l'm not allowed to play with this. We're not playing, we're working! Come on! Hold the workpiece... And go! Are you completely crazy? What if he hurts his hands? Just imagine the disaster! Hi, Helen! We are building wings! Wings!? What for? To fly, of course! That's what they'll look like. Promise that you'll never play with such dangerous things again! We're not playing, we're working. - l'm the boss here. - But l wear the trousers. l wish you a very Happy Birthday. Many thanks. When you come here next time, we will fly. Oh no, you can't do this to me. No, l'm very proud of you. l'm proud of you too. We'll eat without daddy. - Bye, lsabel. - See you. Bye-bye. We're going to Sonja and Walter. Your dinner is on the table. - We'll be back around 11, OK? - Yes, l know. How long are you gonna stay in your room? Until l'm an adult. Can you help me? lt's much too heavy for us. - lf you want, you can come with me. - Until we're adults? Really? That's extreme. Do you want to know how bats reproduce? No, thank you. - What do you want to be when you grow up? - l don't know yet. You know so much, but not that? l want to become a rock singer. Sounds good. lsabel get up! Come on, l'll take you home. - lsabel, what did you two do? - No idea. Come with me. l'm back. What's got into that girl? - Did you ask her? - No. How could she give alcohol to Vitus? Come here. - You've filmed them? - Yes, l used a sensor. My jewellery! - We need a new babysitter. - OK, but she's a good dancer... Think it over. Sorry, but l've already decided. - And what about your career? - Maybe this is my career. Even the experts say: "Now. Or never." You're very quiet. Are you ill? What seems to be bothering you? l've been waiting all day. Let me guess... You're in love? Not me. But l know who I will marry when l grow up. Really? And who will that be? Come on, tell me! But it's still a secret. Mummy, when is lsabel coming? l have a surprise for you. You have a new babysitter... Me! l don't need a babysitter! And lsabel is my girlfriend. lsabel won't be coming anymore. She's too young to have such a huge responsibility. - Come on, let's practise the piano. - No! l want lsabel back! Are you crazy? Hello, who is it? - Post, express-delivery. - l'm coming! Vitus, you can't do that! Open that stupid door at once! Vitus, open the door! Damn it all! l'll give you one more chance! Or else l'll get the caretaker with his crowbar. l'll count to 10! One, two, three... four, five, six, seven... eight, nine, TEN! Look, it's the "Professor", coming to school by taxi. Poor guy! That smart-ass could at least wear normal clothes. "Shitus" will do that when he reaches puberty. The interest is 1.258% and is continuously credited. How much money will be in his account after 322 days? Without the calculator, please. Ah, someone knows the result already... No, Sir. But l could calculate it for you. Then go on. lf the account neither has credit, nor debit, the interest would be... So, after 322 days... There would be 19466.6 in the account. Correct. But your arrogant behaviour is an insult to my intelligence. Excuse me, Sir, If l am insulting your intelligence, well... at least, there are two people in here who have some intelligence. OK, that's enough. Pack your bag and get out! The school has phoned again. What has he done this time? - They want to talk to us. - Talk to us? - ls Wednesday at 3 o' clock, OK? - Next week? No chance. - It's important. - Yes, l know. - lt's a shame your husband's not here. - l know, sorry. You can speak Swiss-German. We really have to find a solution. Your son sabotages every lesson. He doesn't miss a single opportunity to make the teacher look stupid in front of the whole class. My teachers refuse to carry on teaching him. But you can't just throw out a child, because he isn't challenged enough. Yes, you're right. That's why there are special schools for the highly gifted. Vitus is wasting his time here. And we are wasting our time. My husband and l are against such "zoological gardens". A special needs school is out of the question. Well... ln that case l'll enroll Vitus for the school-leaving exams. - At the age of 12? - Yes, why not? Hold your horses. The left hand has to hold the pace. Hold back a bit. Know what l mean? That's boring. Let's try the second last bar, and try to play it a little bit boring. - Would you like another slice? - Yes, please. Thanks. - Do you want to do your final exams now? - l don't know. Why should l? You could go to university. You'll earn a lot as an engineer. You could still play piano as a hobby. - The lnstitute of Technology at 13? - Well, OK, it is a bit early... You could do a traineeship with us for 2 or 3 years. You could invent something, like your dad. Have you seen this before? lt's the "Mother of all Hearing Aids. Worldwide." ln fact it's the further development of the "Cat-Ear" and " Bat-Ear". lt's a kind of Rolls-Royce. With this, Phonaxis has increased its turnover tenfold. lf l had bought some shares then, we'd be rich now. But we are rich! l mean really rich. Shall l tell you a secret? The boss will be retiring soon. There's a rumour, that l'll be his successor. Cool! You'll be the CEO of Phonaxis! Touch wood... Ah, where were we? Ah, yes. You have to plan your career. Let's have a look at it together... Von Holzen. Hi, Klaus. What about the chips? l'm kind of busy, but go ahead. Bat scientist, architect, chemist, fancy any of these? Maybe cabinetmaker, and you could take over my workshop. - No. - No... What about banker? Taxi driver? l got it... Pilot. You don't even want to become a pilot. lt's getting difficult now. Maybe a butcher? Vet? Surgeon? You are a hopeless case. - l'd like to be someone else. - Like, who, for example? l don't know. Whoever. Just normal. - As normal as me? - No, more normal. - Well, then just become normal... - But how? Hold this! lf you can't decide, you may have to part with some things you like. Get it? You've only practised for two hours! lf l have to play "Holding Back", l can also practise "Holding Back". Don't talk nonsense! - She lives in a castle?! - Look! - She's coming towards us. - ls that her? Yes, that's her. Gina Fois, the living piano legend, herself. She looks like an old bat. So, you're Vitus. Nice to meet you. Have a seat. What are you going to play for me? l'd like you to play something for me. Me? That's very flattering. But l'd rather listen to you playing Scarlatti's Sonata in E Minor. No. OK, l'll play something for you, but it's your turn first. l don't feel like it. - Do it for me. - Why is it always for you? Don't worry madam. lt's more important for a pianist to have good parents than good teachers. Vitus, you should play neither for your mother, nor for me. Just take your time until you feel like playing the piano for the sake of the music. Cold rationality and a warm heart. That's what makes a great pianist. That's why l want to become a vet. Can l visit grandpa for the weekend? No way! Do you have any idea how many youngsters would like an opportunity like this? They come here from all over the world just for one single piano lesson. And you?! We're here! He was lucky. We couldn't find any injuries. Not one bruise... Extraordinary, considering the heavy fall. There are miracles though, especially with children. - The wings carried him for a bit. - But he isn't an lcarus, luckily. He's still unconscious! At the moment the initial diagnosis is concussion of the brain. What do you mean "at the moment"? There are injuries, which only show up after a few days. With brain injuries you can never rule out long-term implications. l'll show you some pictures. - You're taking a long time! - Sorry. Well, l have plenty of time. Check! - And what is this? - Dad brought it. lt's for my exams. Vitus, what are you doing? This isn't our car. The following Mrs. von Holzen: We have tested his speaking and reading skills. His memory and his sense of perception. We got normal levels. - What does "normal levels" mean? - Please, take a seat. "Normal" according to his age group. He's even slightly above average, especially in his logical thinking. And the lQ test? Did you do... Yes, but at the moment, the test is irrelevant. But if you really want to know, it's around 120. how is that possible? l know. lt's difficult to say. Even for specialists like us, the brain remains a mystery. There's no real explanation for extraordinary abilities. lf l can give you some advice: Give yourself and Vitus some time. Time, time, time... He'll make some progress. You just want to cheer me up. Many thanks. l don't understand your disappointment, you have a healthy and normal child! l have given worse news to a lot of parents. Listen everybody! Silence please! Daniel, please! This is your new classmate, Vitus. He has changed schools and will now be with us. Vitus, you can sit next to Jens. - Hi, Vitus, what's up? - Hi, Jens. Loosen up... Now make a fist. Yes, that's right. And again. Play the run, and take your time! Doesn't it hurt your ears? At least your fingers should be able to remember. Sorry. Music comes from the heart, from your fingers, from your soul! All you hurt was your head. - Don't you feel lonely sometimes? - Yes, l do. Loneliness is the worst. But l'm doing something about it. - l write love letters. - To whom? Until recently, l'd only written to Anna Maria. But now l'm getting more generous. l'm writing to the beautiful woman who sat opposite me on the train. And to the glistening lake. To the lovely figure skater on TV. And to the cool shade under the pear tree. And then? They fly beautifully. Fabulous. - Shall l gift wrap it? - No. - A bag? - Yes, please. That's 39 Francs, please. Checkmate. - Come on, lets go to the workshop. - l'll just listen to this CD quickly. l'll be there in a minute. Sorry. No problem. Don't worry. l won't tell anyone. My lips are sealed. - Promise? - Promise. - Forever? - Until the end of my days. Thanks. That's incredible, you've fooled everyone! Teachers, parents, doctors... Super. Not bad! The most difficult thing was losing a game of chess. OK, let's blow out the candles together for you, Vitus. Listen everyone! As godmother l have made Vitus' horoscope. He is exactly... Mum, you're smoking? l love you too. Was that Luisa? This was on your first birthday. Can l? From an astrological point of view it is a special planetary constellation. lf my calculations are right, Vitus will aim for the highest and most beautiful. Even as a child, he will orientate his values towards the spiritual and the arts. lndians would say a "Mahatma" is born. Where did you come from? Fly in through the window? May l see the horoscope you made for me? Yes, of course. Are you interested in astrology? What is a "Mahatma"? What's the matter Vitus? You're talking a whole lot of rubbish. OK, then, Vitus. Do you at least know the river which flows through Cairo? - Nope. - High-German, please! No idea, but l could look it up in an atlas for you. Thanks, but l know the name of the river. So, teachers always know more than their pupils. Yes, that's usually the case. ln that case, you know who invented the steam engine? Of course l know that. lt was James Watt. And why didn't his teacher invent the steam engine? - What's the matter? - Looks like the roof will fall in. l had to take a loan. The bank more or less owns the house now. - Just to fix the roof? - No, l can do that myself. l have calculated it'll be only five more years till my money runs out. Why don't you ask dad? l'm sure he'll give you some! Your father lives on credit himself. What he is currently spending, he will earn six months from now. Hi, Leo. Now you're too late. Vitus is on the train. l know. l wanted to see you again. - Really? - Yeah. Are you clearing things out? Yup! - Do you have time? - l always have time. Hold on. How are you? The annual report came out yesterday... How are you, Leo, not the company? Well, everything is... much worse than expected. - ls there only one rabbit left? - Yes, l've eaten all the others. People think that Phonaxis is booming, when in fact, we're in deep, deep shit. - Would you like a coffee? - Yes, I'd love one. You look tired. There is an internal list of who is going to be fired. Next week the figures will be released. What does Helen say? She has enough problems with Vitus. Still? She doesn't talk about it, but l think she still hopes that Vitus will get back to normal again. The way he used to be. - Like another? - Yes. Watch your suit. Haven't you noticed anything? Did he play piano at yours? Or chess? Well, my dear Leo... l'm afraid to disappoint you. - Spaghetti? - Yup. Catastrophy! - Why? - l just need a beer right now. Have you eaten anything? l had spaghetti at my father's. l have bad news. The annual report is an absolute disaster. l'm pessismistic. What's that? A new game? No, the stock market prices. Cool, a stock market game! Maybe. The stock market is a bad thing. Not at all, the stock market is great. You can stand to make 1000 percent profit, but only lose 100 percent. l know from a reliable source that Phonaxis shares are going to crash. To take advantage of our insider knowledge, we'll buy put options. There'll be no risk for you at all. l thought that was illegal. We'll reinvest the profits into Nasdaq technology shares. Or into Chinese red chips shares. Or into hedge funds. We'll make a fortune in no time! You just have to sign here. l've prepared everything already. l didn't know that any idiot could speculate via the internet. What exactly am l signing here? l need your signature to access the stock market online. Our codename is "Dr. Wolf." "Dr. Wolf?" That would be all my savings, my house, my pension... Everything I own. lf you lose the money, l'll be out in the street in "no time". Planes are safer when they stay on the ground. But they are meant to fly. Well, there's no point reading it. l wouldn't understand it anyway. lt's 2 o'clock! lt should come out now! What time is it? l can't stand this any longer. l may go to bed or for a walk. Or both. l'm going to have a heart attack. Now! lt's dropping and dropping! That's good, grandpa. That's what we want! You're a millionaire now! You're late. - Grandpa sends his love. - Thank you. - Did you have a nice time? - Yes. Today was a catastrophic day. - What happened? - lt's too complicated... lt's all to do with the stock market. The company's worse off than ever. l'm trying to avert the worst, even though l don't know how. Sometimes you have to cut the tree, in order to save the fruit. What's the matter? Can l help you? No. l was just thinking. Can you recommend a CD? What do you like? Spice Girls, that kind of stuff. We'll have to go that section. Spice Girls are out. l'd have to order it. Why don't you try this one? Or, l'm sure you'll like this one. lt's one of the tops at the moment. And listen to No. 4 on this one. Grandpa? What the heck is this? Come in. Cool! l've just been to the bank... Look! The Lake Constance. There are 3 million, 271 thousand and a few more francs in my account. Thanks to you, l was able to buy this flight simulator. Wow! Look! The Rhine runway. We're going to land there. For God's sake! No... l won't make it, OK, let's touch-and-go! l shouldn't talk during the touch-down. l've made some calculations: l can become 130 now. - Super! - Super. Can l have a go? Yes, as long as l'm co-pilot. l was able to convince managment that it can be an opportunity, if the share-price is rock bottom. My boss got up and said, "Thank you, Leo. Your plan sounds convincing... But l won't be making any decisions. My successor will." "35 years ago l took over my father's company with eight people. Now it's time to hand things over." Everybody was looking at me, except Nick. Don't keep us on tenterhooks. Then he let the cat out of the bag. "l've decided to hand over the business to my son, Niklaus." But that's a paradox! Yes, indeed, it is a paradox. Later my boss came to me and said, "Thanks, Leo. You showed style and grandness. Let's drink to Phonaxis." And l said, "Phonaxis... To your son? Why?" "There's the family and there's the firm. What would you have decided?" l answered, "l would have decided in favour of my son as well." A company needs liquidity like the brain needs oxygen. lf it lacks oxygen, the brain dies. That's why l see this as our only chance. That means full surrender! lt won't change much for us. They'll let us do our work. But Nick, that's completely naive. They'll be giving the orders! They just want to invest their money. Verena, gentlemen. Now that it's worth nothing, it would be absolutely, utterly crazy to sell the company to the Americans! What's the matter? No comment? Everyone, except you, has realized that Phonaxis has to slim down. We all have to pull together. One member of the managment, Leo von Holzen, hasn't been doing that for some time now. lt would be better, Leo, if you went your own way. What do you mean? You're fired. Yesterday, l was at the bank. Last time I checked there was And now there is 5,736,000. How come? Maybe it's the interest. lnterest? How can you earn so much money without working? lt's dead easy. Let the money do the work. ls it yours? No, his! Mine! - Can l? - You can do anything. Except fly. - Where's the battery? - Next to the the controls. And then the starter. And your father's on a business trip? Did you say Beijing? Exactly! He told me to choose something nice for him. He'll be delighted. Sure. And what about the interior design? You can leave that to me. You already have the money. A year's rent in advance. You have to press the red button. - Hello. - Hi. What's all this then? Classical music? Are you fed up with Hip Hop? - lsa, what has happened? - Forget it. - Come on, tell me! - lt's over. - What? - Yes, he has another girl. l knew it... - l knew this would happen. - Oh, forget it. Hey, listen to this. lt must be a bootleg. l've never heard anything as cool as this. Do you know the Russian piano school? Mum? - Wow, l've never been here before. - l like the anonymity here. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. Delicious. Let's go 50/50 on this, OK? No way. That's for you. What is it? A small gift. - lt's not real, is it? - Of course it is. You're crazy. A diamond ring... l can't accept it. Anyway, why would you give me a ring? Because l love you. Because you love me? For real? With all the bits and pieces? For sure. Listen, l love you too. But when l was your babysitter, you were like a brother to me. And l still feel the same. Are you listening to me? Well, statistically women are usually But that's really stupid. Because men die 7 years earlier, women are widows for 14 years. You're a real genius at maths. We would die at the same time! Besides, a woman's libido is at its peak 10 years later than a man's. - The libido? - Exactly. That's why so many relationships fail. Women should be older than their men. We would be the perfect couple! l think the food is coming. - Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. lsabel, you're the love of my life. And what about sex? Well, that could wait for a while. lt's just an optional exchange of DNA anyway. Vitus, l'm a woman, and you're 12. But that's just a number. l can't live without you. l'll prove to you that you can. Bye. No! Finally! What happened to you? - Where have you been? - Leave me alone. No, grandpa, no. Don't do this to me. He wanted to fix the roof and fell. What kind of suit is that? Can l help you? Do you want to get up? No. Pass me something to write with. Thanks. Take a seat. Don't you worry about me. l flew. You flew? Yes. l won't tell anyone. Do you remember the sliding gate? The fence at the airport? With the chain and the brass lock? - Yes, the gate to the runway! - Yes. After 300 hours in the simulator, l got a bit bored. So l took the keys for my PC-6, went to my tool-kit and took my bolt cutters. l went to the airport, very early in the morning. lt was a lovely morning. Very peaceful. There was an air of expectation. l cut the chain and slowly opened the gate. l started the engine. The propellers started to turn. The gate to the runway was closed, but a PC-6 doesn't need a runway. You just have to keep the brakes on at full throttle, until you reach maximum speed. Then you release the brakes. And after you... ...shoot straight into the sky. Even the birds got jealous. "Dear Helen, dear Leo, dear Vitus, Have l ever told you that l love you? Maybe. But surely not often enough. So, l love you all." Hello, Dr. Wolf? Luisa Meichtri from A-publishers. Excuse me, Dr. Wolf? l'm sorry Luisa. You're my last hope. You've got to help me. lt's about Leo. The Americans want to buy Phonaxis. l knew it! You sly dog! l appoint you as the new CEO of Dr. Wolf Holding. As the successor of my grandfather, who died 3 weeks ago. What? What are you talking about? l'll lie here until that bastard begs me to come back. l'm not sure if we can wait that long to pay our rent. ls that your English sense of humour? Just give Nick a call. Me? He should call me. He cannot lose face. Neither can l. To your Phonaxis! To my CEO! You mean, to your front woman. Oh dear, that was so stressful! - Tell me! - This is good. You should have seen the Americans when l topped their last offer of 400 with 420. Their negotiator was furious. "Let's go!", he shouted. ''He's taking the piss! The shares aren't worth half the price." He was right about that. Before he and his people left, he wanted to know from Hoffmann junior if this Dr. Wolf was a friend of his. Really? What was his answer? All he knew, was that the bankers called Wolf, "The Phantom of the Stock Exchange". Then l wrote down the sales price and presented the contract to Hoffman. On the last page. He signed it. Well done! Of course he tried to find out who is behind the holding over a drink. And? All l said was, that Dr. Wolf had died recently and that his sole heir would be in touch soon. - Hello, Paul. - Leo, why are you here? l have to finish something off. l can't believe it! Yes, l know. Sorry, Nick. l'll call back. My family's existence is on the line. l want my job back. l'll even work in the workshop, for the same money. You bloody hypocrite. But you know what? l won't give you the chance to fire me. Here's my resignation! "Dear Leo, after finding out your late father was behind the ''Dr. Wolf Holding'', and you were the new owner of Phonaxis, l made the decision to hand in my notice." "Dear Helen, dear Leo, dear Vitus, Have l ever told you that l love you? Maybe. But surely not often enough. So, l love you all. Helen, Leo, you are the nicest couple since the invention of marriage. And you, Vitus, my best and most loyal friend. You make me happy. Now at this moment, and whenever l think of you. The world rests on your love for one another. No wonder such a wonderful human being like Vitus came out of it." lt's a farewell letter from your father. "Please forgive me for every minute that l took him away from you. As l am dead now, dear Helen and dear Leo, l can tell you a little secret, which l promised not to tell, as long as l lived. Vitus never fell on his head. His brain functions so perfectly that he managed to fool all of us. Please don't be angry with him! What other way is there for a child to escape from a world for which he is too intelligent? Farewell, your grandpa." Hey, hello? Hey, turn it off! "P.S. And you Vitus, keep on following your star." Translation: Daniel Bitterli Edited by Mel David.
