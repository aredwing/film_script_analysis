I think he comprends. How about some refreshment, love? Sorry, Harold. Hey, son! Me and your mother would like to have a bit of a talk. How about going outside? Bubby ain't used to going outside. By himself... Son, you ain't a poofter, are you? I don't want any son of mine growing up to be a... homosexual. I'd disown him first. You got to try to understand... Me and Bubby... We been here... hm... by ourselves a long time. But he ain't like other kids. He was such a difficult birth. All alone in here, no one to help you... I didn't think I'd pull through. So you gotta try to understand. As long as he ain't a poofter. Oh, no. No, he ain't. Dry old conversation, Flo! Pardon? Dry old conversation! Oh, sorry! We don't get very many visitors! Hm, would a sherry do? Any port in the storm...! Any port in the storm... I can see right down your dress, Flo. God, you've got great tits!

Harold, it's... - He was trying to kill me! - He was not! - You mad, you bastard! He didn't mean you any harm, he was just trying to see whether you breathed or not. What?! It's not his fault, he's got some strange ideas. You can't blame the kid. He can't help it. He never had a father. Nearly killed the only one he's got. Christ, kid! You're a weirdo! Weirdo. Christ, kid. You're a weirdo. Christ, kid. You're a weirdo! You've got lovely skin, Flo. Soft, and sexy. You're a sexy woman. You make it hard for a red-blooded man to keep his hands off you. You have lovely hands, Harold. Be a pity not to be using them. What's that you've found, then? Don't know. Don't know what this could be. It's me dress that's what you've found. Yeah... But what's this, under the dress? You have already had your look at it. Is it...? Is it? You'll have to wait and see! Gates of Paradise... One of the seven wonders of the world! Do you really think so? Yes. It's not too big? It's perfection, Flo. Oh, that's lovely... Hey, you see...? Oh yeah, do that again... Oh, that's nice... HEY! Get the fuck out of here! You pervert! Give your mother some privacy! Go back to bed, Bubby! Why the hell you call him Bubby? Bubby's a stupid name! I was waiting for you to get back. But it suits him.

Get off the fucking road, you fucking greenie bastard! I don't like fucking smart cunts! I saw what that fucking pig did to you... Beer? There's some down here. I've gotta stop drinking.

Sure, a bit of rock'n'roll! One! Two! One-two-three! #If you see Kay! #Can you tell her I'm leaving? #Can you tell her I'm losing my mind? #If you see Kay! #Can you tell her I'm leaving #If you'd say until she says okay #I've got to hear you say okay #I've got to make her take away #I can't figure it out any other way! #F.

Is this where the band supposed to be? Yeah. Alright... Hm... What time are you starting? About an hour and half ago, but nobody's turned up yet. Want to come in? We'll play! I... don't think so. I was hoping there'd be some girls. No girls, mate, only music. Thanks anyway! Who was that? I don't know. A neighbour complaining about all the racket we were making. Ah, very fucking funny, mate. He was a customer. Where did he go? How the fuck would I know? Down the road to see another band! And you just let him walk out! What the fuck was I supposed to do? Force him? How the fuck we're going to pay for the hall, if you let all the people walk out without paying! Jesus fucking Christ! Is that the lot? - I've nothing. - I've nothing. What about you, hold-out? Is that it? Try the other pocket, mate, we saw you tried that one before. Nothing! Never anything. How about you? Got any money? Sure... Search him. Money! Do you have any money? You greedy little cunt! I ain't got enough money to keep buying you milk! So take that, mate! Shut up! Well, if that's all there is... ...we're stuffed. Yeah! We're stuffed. - Christ! - Hilarious...

We're going to go to jail! - Bullshit! - Shut up! Look! Look...! Let's just put these on. More trouble that he's worth. You just take care of that money. It's alright, Bubby. #Tell you a story #that's sad but true #Tell you a story #about you know who #A boy called Bubby #sitting right over there #Bad Boy Bubby #with the wild, crazy hair...

He's a classic, isn't he? You don't own a cat, do you, Dan? We're going to leave you with Dan, Bubby. Okay? See you, Bubby! And don't be a bad boy! #Bad Boy Bubby... #Bad Boy Bubby Blues... Hey! Hey! Why don't you go and talk to her, if she's so interesting? You're a sexy woman, Flo. God, you've got great tits. Great, big whoppers of things. You're a very cruel person, do you know that? Just because you're rich, and you're handsome, you... ...you think it's okay to make fun of people like me? Well, it's not funny! It's just hurtful! Bubby naughty bad boy, dirty little cunt! Oh, leave me alone! Leave me alone! Just please, leave me... Go away from me! SOMEONE HELP ME! Why don't you bastards do something! Watch the language, lady, or I cool you off for a couple of days! Hey, we're not the bloody criminals! Those arseholes stole our purses! We can't help if you go walk about at night by yourselves! Who'd want to steal from a boong? Oh, for Christ's sake! We were on our way home from work! Work?! Huh! That'd be the day! Something illegal, no doubt! Youse are really fucked! Now, I warned you about the language! Now you can piss off out of here! And consider yourselves lucky I didn't lock up the pair of you! Fuck, let's go! I'd have that head wound seen to! Get fucked! Psst! Whatcha doin'? What ya doin'? What're you doin'?

Jesus can see everything I do... ...and he's going to beat me brainless! Come! You see... No one's going to help you, Bubby. Because there isn't anybody out there to do it. No one. We're all just complicated arrangements of atoms and subatomic particles, we don't live. But our atoms do move about in such a way as to give us identity and consciousness. We don't die; our atoms just rearrange themselves. There is no God. There can be no God, it's ridiculous to think in terms of a superior being. An inferior being, maybe, because we, we who don't even exist, we arrange our lives with more order and harmony than God ever arranged the earth. We measure... Plot... We create wonderful music. We are the architects of our own existence. What a lunatic concept to bow down before a God who slaughters millions of innocent children... Who slowly and agonisingly starves them to death... beats them, tortures them... Rejects them. What folly to even think that we should not insult such a God... Damn him! Think him out of existence. It is our duty to think God out of existence. It is our duty to insult Him. Fuck you, God! Strike me down if you dare, you tyrant! You non-existent fraud! It is the duty of all human beings to think God out of existence. Then we have a future. Because then, and only then, do we take full responsibility for who we are. And that's what you must do, Bubby! Think God out of existence. Take responsibility for who you are! Fuck you, God! Strike me down, if you dare! Fuck you, God. Fuck you, God! Strike me down, if you dare! Hello! - Hello! - Hello! - Hello! - Hello. - What're you doing?! - Bubby good boy. Let's get him! - You pervert! - Son of a bitch! You be's right... You be right, Mum...

Bubby don't know. Do you think he might be schizo? I don't think he's anything... He's just a... kid! Bubby a big weird kid! Christ, kid! You're a weirdo! Pop not a kid! If we take him anywhere, they're going to lock him up! And I feel he shouldn't be locked up! What is it, Rachael? She think me should stay! Is that what you think, Rachael? What about the others? What do you think? Do you want Pop to stay? Yes. Yes! Well, I'm sure you've got some stories to tell! Like who's Bubby, for instance? You're Bubby, aren't you? Bubby been left to die! Me Pop now! Oh... Pop want to see Angel's tits! No. But I'll show Bubby! Bubby want to see Angel's tits! I don't hear Bubby! Bubby no fit no more out here! Me Bubby. Them be beautiful. Like Mum. Don't you think they're too big? Them be perfection! Okay... It's enough for now... You go back to being Pop. And Bubby's our secret. Okay? It's a garden, and it's filled with roses... All different colours... And it smells so beatiful in the garden. It is a very special garden. No one knows about this garden... No one is allowed to come in. Only people who love you. Only people who care about you. And only people you want to let in. There's a very high picket fence around the garden... Hidden in the high grass... And no one can see it. Imagine yourself being in that garden... lying on the grass... feeling very comfortable. It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining... and it's warm. And the wind gently touches your cheeks... Hi. I'm off duty now, so I'm going to show you where you'll be sleeping. Rachael think Pop stay in her room. Are you saying what I think you're saying? Sorry, Rachael, but Pop will stay in Pandy's room. Okay? Here's your bed and there's your suitcase and I put your cat in the freezer, we can bury that tomorrow, okay? A band? Cat got your tongue? It's the Animal for you! Psst! Pop! Come here! We've got a surprise for you! We've got some people who'd really like to get to know you! Come on, come on! Go, get'em, Pop! Is that you, Pop? Me be Pop! I'm Shannon! I'm Sharon! Won't you join us? What do you think? Do you like us? I've never had a virgin before! Don't be scared! We'll show you what to do! Tiny tits... Tiny?! These aren't tiny, they're perfect 36's! Where did you come from? Them not Angel tits. Who's Angel? I don't know... Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust. Good-bye, Cat. There... She's happy with God now! It is the duty of all human beings to think God out of existence. Full of surprises, aren't we... Be still, Kat! I'll beat you brainless, by Christ! Poison don't get you... God will...! Them not tiny tits! Them great big whoppers of things! Pop love them tits! Pop love them tits! No. No! That not be. Not be... What's the matter, Bubby? Bubby crying with sadness for Rachael... because Rachael have no Bubby. Rachael... be loving Bubby. Oh, my poor Rachael... And Bubby be loving Angel... Oh, Bubby... I only really visit when I have to. It always ends in a fight. And then I don't go for a while... And then they forgive me, then we fight all over again. A bit of a mess but dad's a collector. Used to be his business. Princess Pink! This is going to be fun... How do you like your dinner, Mr Pop? Pizza be better than this. Our daughter has a healthy appetite, don't you think? Mother, don't start. Be quiet! Let your mother speak uninterrupted! Thank you, dear! We tried to bring her up as best as we could but she's been rather a disappointment to us. Be the first time you didn't finish your dinner! I find fat people so... so gross! So unfortunate, of course but so... ugly... And what do you think, Mr Pop? Me think Angel be beautiful. She's a fat slut! Be careful what you say, dear! Better he'd know that she's a fat slut! If God had wanted us to be fat he'd have made us all the same weight, wouldn't he? But he didn't! God doesn't like fat people! Fat people are an abomination in his eyes! Fuck you, God! Strike me down, if you dare! Angel be beautiful! God be a useless cunt! NO! Why you be bad to Angel? You can go now, Mr Pop! We shall pray for you! Get out of here! Angel come too? My parents were just waiting to die anyway, Bubby. They were both riddled with poisons and cancers... Asbestos from the break linings... Lead from the car exhaust. PCP's from the car seats. Dioxins, parathidions, dieldrin... Mercury. Radioactivity. Whoever did it, just put them out of their misery. Ashes to ashes... dust to dust. That be nice. That be poisoning us! That be poisoning the air that we breathe! If the poison don't get you... then God will! Beautiful, isn't it? Fantastic. And yet... This is mob have been trying for centuries to clingwrap this mob. Even though they share the same god. Mind you, this mob have been getting pretty good at clingwrapping lately. And this mob's got the same god as well. But they've had a fair go of clingwrapping that first mob... They've been trying to clingwrap that second mob for a good couple of thousand years. And they pretty well succeeded in clingwrapping just about all of this mob. They never did much clingwrapping... to anyone... but themselves. Then there's this lot. A different god altogether. You'd think that would help. But it doesn't. See, this mob clingwrapped about half a million of that first mob. Fourty or fifty years ago. And they've been at it ever since. They've all done their fair share of killing or being killed. And it's all pointless. The thing, Bubby, is: don't be like them. No matter how mad you get at someone... don't kill them. Ever. Bubby done clingwrap them. Me Pop now! Talking like you'll be running the country soon enough... No more excuses! No more clingwrapping. Okay? Bubby? Okay. And... don't mention it to anyone. We look like all being... rich and famous soon enough, so... let's not spoil it. Okay. Collars! Yes, mate? How much that be? That be five dollar! Where be Pop? Where be Pop? When be them come on stage? Them be there soon! Them be there real soon! Where be Pop! You be a sexy woman, Flo! You be a sexy woman, Flo! Me see right down your dress! You got great big whoppers, Flo! Me want to see them tits!
