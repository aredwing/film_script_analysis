They're happy because it's Christmas Eve and they've all got jobs. Doing what? They're going to be in Oliver Courtney's new show. He writes the words and music. Which one is Mr. Courtney? Standing right here. Where? Here. See? With the beautiful girl. Every time you write a new song, I could kiss you. That spurs me to greater effort, Millie. Someday I must try a symphony. Oliver! I don't suppose there's a more successful songwriter in the country today. And who is the man at the piano? Huh? That's Mr. Courtney's assistant, Billy Starbuck. He's sort of a Jack-of-all-trades. Everybody, let's have a square dance. Choose your partners. But, Oliver, we came to hear your music. Yes. Oliver, how 'bout playing some of the music for the new show? Please, Oliver. I've got nothing presentable yet. You said you'd play one of the songs tonight. We came expressly for that purpose. He's just teasing. Play my big number in which I come out of the oyster. Oyster? Charlie, what's this about an oyster? Oh, I... forgot to tell you. Grafskaya has done us a ballet where Millie comes out of an oyster. That's just marvelous! My song is called, ''What Would Shakespeare Have Said?'' Play it. If it's good, we'll have her come out of a big volume of Shakespeare. [ Woman ] Oh, that's impossible. But then I can't wear my bathing suit. Never mind that. Oliver, we're all waiting. [ Whistles ] Charlie, would you excuse me for a moment? Excuse me, everybody. Oh, he's not going to play! Keep that other door closed. Don't let anyone in. This is a fne time to be getting here! Where have you been? Who me? I've been visiting my uncle at Tarrytown. Yes, you. Don't you realize I've got a room full of people waiting to hear the new song? Well... here she is! It's wet. That's sweat. How'd it work out? Don't you want to hear it? It's a good idea to know what you've composed. All right. Play it over softly. Sing the lyrics. This may be a little tough for you. Is this your handwriting? Yes, sir. Want me to play it the way it's written? You could surprise me. I will, honeysuckle. Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait. Is that in there? [ Chuckles ] d What would Shakespeare have said d d If he had ever seen you d d Well, that's exactly what I've been trying to say d d Take charming and adorable d d They're practically obsolete d d And I think it's deplorable d d To depend on a word like sweet d d What would Shakespeare have said d d If you had lived in his day d d I only know how immensely thrilled he would be d d I love you wouldn't be strong enough d d He'd coin a phrase instead d d 'Cause you're oh, so Darn it d d What would Shakespeare have said d d That's easily the best thing you ever wrote. Thanks. Thank you. Have you got the orchestrations? Here's the piano part. Here's the brass. Here's the reeds. The strings-- Oh, here's the strings. Here's the bass part. There you are. Thanks. There's a man writes a great lyric! d What would Shakespeare have said d d If he had ever seen you d d Well, that's exactly what I've been trying to say d Lovely! d Take charming and adorable d d They're practically obsolete d d And I think it's deplorable d d To depend on a word like sweet d She doesn't get any life into it, no bounce. Don't you think so? It's lavender and old lace... but it's gruesome. d I only know how immensely thrilled he would be d d I love you wouldn't be strong enough d d He'd coin a phrase instead d d 'Cause you're oh, so Darn it d d What would Shakespeare have said d d What would you like now? Some more of my stuff? Go on,john. Give 'em some more. Um, forgive me for Just a minute, will you? Say, it went over pretty good, didn't it? Oh, pardon me. I was just going. No, no. Wait a minute, Bob. This being Christmas Eve and everything, I have a little surprise for you. You have? You've been writing tunes for me for about a year. Mm-hmm. If it weren't for my lyrics and my name on them, they probably would have never gotten to frst base. But you've been loyal, very, very loyal. I haven't told a soul. Um, yes, um-- I don't want you to think I don't appreciate it. Therefore, Mr. Starbuck and I have decided to offer you a contract. Contract? Mm-hmm. Fifty dollars a week for three years, no options. All you have to do is continue to keep your mouth shut. And write good tunes. [ Chuckles ] Naturally. Come on, lazybones. Come on over here. Sign right here on the nervous line. Thanks. I'm gonna keep my mouth shut because that's part of my job. But I don't want any contract. [ Together] You don't want any contract? No. Why not? In the frst place, I don't like music. You don't like music? I like it when you're feeling like singing. But I wouldn't want to make it my life's work. The poor man's parasite. What's the matter, haven't you got any ambition? Not much. Good. Wait, Starbuck. Surely there must be something you want? Yeah, now that you mention it, there is. What is it? A catboat. A catboat. Yeah. My uncle runs this place in Tarrytown. Yes, yes, yes. But if you sign this contract right away, you can have a catboat now on the installment plan. Then you can sail around and make up songs. That's very nice. But I'd rather not be tied down to anything unless it's a catboat. I fgured if I could save a little dough, I could go to this place my uncle runs. If you mention that uncle again, I'll fre you! My uncle's a very nice man. Here's your fountain pen. So long. Say, is that a hep catboat you want or just a catboat? Just a plain, ordinary old catboat. Don't go too far. That's why we got you that cell downstairs. I did want to visit my uncle-- No. There's a lot of work in this new show... and we want you around. Mr. Courtney likes you so much he can't do a thing without you. He can't, huh? Well, I'll see you later. Wait a minute. What? What kind of a place is this your uncle runs? A nudist farm? Oh, no, no, nothing like that. Just a little hideaway on the river. It's called Nobody's Inn. Feather beds. Hot and cold folding doors. Have a card. Built-in tea wagon. Take some up to the union next time you go there. Ah, Nobody's Inn. ''Peace...It's wonderful.'' Why does he call it Nobody's Inn? He's a funny fellow, my unk. He won't let anybody in unless he likes their face. But you can come up. I might be able to do somethin' for you. And a Merry Christmas to you too... Scrooge! Merry Christmas, Bates. Thank you. Wait a minute, Bates, what have you got there? Telegram for Mr. Courtney, sir. Here, I'll take it. You stay right here. [ Whistles ] Bates, are you a registered nurse? Why, no, sir. You better become one. Got any smelling salts? I think so. Don't think, make sure and have a bucket and sponge. And, Bates, lock all the windows and hide his razor. Thank you so much. Oh, Oliver-- Give me a glass of champagne, will you? I say, everything's fne. I'm still in the groove. You better dig yourself a nice deep one. Why, what's wrong? Your lyric writer Just fell dead. Oh. Bates! Croon. Spoon. Tune. Soon. Agh! june. How about loon or goon? It's no use, Billy. I haven't been able to write a good song of my own since ''Good-bye To Love.'' Oh! And a good song must come from the heart. Not with your ears. My heart just stopped singing when she died. She didn't die. She got fat. What? Why try that sentimental drool on me? You know she married a guy in Naples who ran a one-arm spaghetti joint. I prefer to think of her as dead. There will never be another like her. There's one born every minute! You're like a swan, only able to produce a good tune... when you're getting it in the neck. I'm looking for that Christmas card that girl sent. What girl? The one who keeps sending you her poems, Cherry Lane. Maybe you could use her. Here it is. Read it to me. ''A Happy New Year to you is my sincerest wish. If music be the food of love, you are my favorite dish.'' [ Chuckling ] You are my favorite dish. I wonder if she's pretty. What does that matter? I thought you were looking for a lyric writer. Starbuck, send for her. I'll see her tomorrow. I'll have her here by carrier pigeon. Pardon me. Does Mr. Oliver Courtney live here? Yes, miss. Take the elevator to the 1 5th floor and then change for the penthouse. Thank you. Good morning, Wilkes. Good morning, sir. Little place of my uncle's. Give it a rumble, will ya? d d [ Humming ] d d [ Whistling ] Oh, pardon me. Certainly. d d [ Whistling ] d d [ Humming ] Floor please. [ Together] Fifteen. d d [ Whistling ] That's a pretty little number. Yes, isn't she? Who? What are you talking about? I'm talking about that tune you were whistling! - Was I whistling a tune? - Don't tell me you've already forgotten it. d d [ Whistling ] d d [ Whistling Continues ] Give me that again, will ya? d d [ Whistling ] Rimsky-Korsakov, 1 888. You're very clever, my friend, but on you it's repulsive. Are you the young lady that wrote these verses? Mm-hmm. Miss Lane, do you like music? I adore it. I can't play well, but a good tune always makes me think of lyrics. They just seem to pop into my head. I had that once. Oh, but I think your melodies lately have been perfectly wonderful. Oh, do you? Of course... nothing will ever come up to ''Good-bye To Love. '? Ah, I wrote that myself!. I mean, um-- That really came from my heart. Um, Miss Lane, how would you like to write my lyrics? I beg your pardon? How would you like to write my lyrics? I couldn't write your lyrics. I could write my own lyrics, but I couldn't write-- Do you mean-- Mm-hmm. Oh, Mr. Courtney, I couldn't do that... or could I? It would give you an opportunity and an income. And it will give me something that I very badly need: some new lyrics. Oh, Mr. Courtney, to be able to write with you, it's unbelievable! I must think of a new rhyme for heaven right away! Will you? Of course I will. Just wait till the girls in Tulsa see my name on one of your songs. They'll simply curl up and die! Miss Lane, I don't want you to labor under a misapprehension. Your name won't appear on the song. My name will be on it as usual. But you'll have all the satisfaction of knowing that you did write it and... you'll be able to dine on something more substantial than the food of love. But, Mr. Courtney, that is misrepresentation. They'll throw me in jail! Oh, no. It's done all the time. A man reaches a position where he's paid a big sum for a song or a story. He has only two hands and one brain. What's the sensible thing to do? Obviously hire someone else. It's called ghostwriting, Miss Lane. It's a very proftable business. For the ghost? For the writer. I'll pay you $50 a week to start with. Well, what's the answer? Well... the answer's yes. Remember you're not to tell anyone you're working for me, or the deal's off. It's a matter of honor. When do we start? How 'bout dining with me tonight? Where? Here. I've got to get started. I've a show in preparation. Well, Mr. Courtney, I admit it all sounds tempting, and I'd be delighted to dine with you on one condition. What's that? Well... that you remember I'm only a ghost. [ Whistles ] How's he doing? He's got an idea. That's all I want. Give it to me. Can she hear us? No, no, no. She's in the other room. d d [ Whistling ] [ Stomping Feet ] d d [ Whistling ] d d [ Whistling ] [ Stomping Feet ] d d [ Whistling ] What's the rest of it? That's all he's got, the front strain. Stick with him until he's got the rest. [ Stomping Feet ] Don't let that arthritis throw you. Go on. d d [ Whistling ] [ Stomping Feet, Whistling ] That's a B-flat chord. Right. What? No prize? Aw, stop practicing. Who's practicing? I'm trying to get this on paper. It took Mozart three hours to compose a whole overture. Was it any good? Oh, yeah. They don't play it anymore. That's the tip-off on Mozart. d d [ Piano ] I just had an idea. A thought just came to me. Uh... a little melody. See what this does to you. I thought of it today. There are no lyrics yet, but that's where you come in. d d [ Piano ] Why'd you stop? Uh, that's all I've got. I mean, uh, it's all that's come to me so far. Well, couldn't you Just fake it? No, no. I'd sooner wait until it comes to me. And it will, yes, it will. There you are, vassal. Fly to your master in the tower. Give him my compliments and you may keep the change. Sometimes I wonder why I put up with you. That's a cinch. You put up with me because he puts up with me. He puts up with me because he's out of the groove. Very sound, very sound. Why I put up with either of you, I haven't been able to fgure out yet. Perhaps this check will explain. Hmm, nice explaining. And I want to thank you for a very tedious afternoon. Not at all. Come on, let's try again. d d [ Humming ] Sorry to interrupt. What do you want? I had a feeling you may have been forgetting something. I haven't. What are you doing here? Remember that tune you were working on? I've been playing it. I had a feeling you may have forgotten it as usual, so I wrote it down. You wrote it down? Oh, you mean the, uh-- Oh, the middle! How perfectly wonderful. Mr. Starbuck, Miss Lane. Miss Lane, Mr. Starbuck. How do you do? Mr. Starbuck does all my thinking for me. It's only a part-time job. He's such a genius that his own music goes in one ear and stays there. He's like all the great composers. Brahms used to set fre to his beard. Never mind about Brahms. Get on with Courtney. d d [ Piano ] Do you mean to say you've had it all the time? I don't know. It's in my head somewhere and I'd just forgotten it. It's never happened to me. With all that babbling, I might forget it. Couldn't you play it one or two times and give me a chance to think? Mr. Starbuck, would you mind? I have only one other line to write. Starbuck, shut up, please. I was only thinking of your next song. Thank you. There. I think I've got it. Could we go over it again please? d The lighthearted gay kind of charm you display d d That's for me d d The wonderful sly little trick with your eye d d That's for me d d What a feather in my hat if I could gratify your wish d d Do you like the movies d d Or what is your favorite dish d Good. d The tilt of your chin when you chuckle or grin d d That's for me d d You might as well know that wherever you go d d There'll I'll be d djust make sure you keep your heart alone and fancy-free d Nice. d No one else can have it d d That's for me d d The lighthearted gay kind of charm you display d d That's for me d d The wonderful sly little trick with your eye d d That's for me d d What a feather in my hat if I could gratify your wish d d Do you like the movies d d Or what is your favorite dish d d The tilt of your chin when you chuckle or grin d d That's for me d d You might as well know that wherever you go d d There'll I'll be d djust make sure you keep your heart alone and fancy-free d d No one else can have it d d That's for me d d That's it! That's easily the best song you've ever written. [ Together] Thanks! Um, that's enough. Thank you, Starbuck. Thank you so much, Mr. Starbuck, for your lovely accompaniment. I'd love to accompany you further. That's far enough. Good night. Thank you, little white father. All kidding aside, that's a swell lyric. Thanks. Now, let's see. Where did you learn to sing? In Tulsa. I'm beginning to admire Tulsa more every minute. We ought to go a long way together, Miss Lane. I hope so too. Patsy! Patsy, come here quick! What's the matter? I've got a job. Ajob. Ajob? Where have I heard that word before? Snap out of it, Patsy. Isn't it wonderful? What's all this about the depression being over? Mrs. Simpson, I've got a job. Ajob? What have you got to do? I can't tell anybody. But you can tell me, Cherry, can't ya? Well, sit down. I guess I can tell you half of it. You see, I just sit in my room and write verses. Verses? You know, poetry. What's the other half? You mean to say that they pay you Just to write poetry? Fifty dollars a week. Oh, well. Oh! Say, this isn't one of those government projects is it? Oh, no! Of course not! d[ Dixieland Jazz ] That's all I can tell you now because I-- What's that? Just a little band that's hired the next room to yours. And are they hot! Wow. A little band? It sounds like the whole zoo. In the room next to mine! Cherry, don't get excited. d[''Tiger Rag'?] d d Boys, boys. How are ya? Hello, Auntie. I want you to meet Miss Cherry Lane, your next door neighbor. Uh-oh. Boys, I'd like to have you meet our next door neighbor. Miss Lane, this is my partner Wingy. Glad to know you. You said your piece. Harry's my favorite nephew. I thought it'd be nice to have some good music in the house. Yes, I can imagine. Anytime you'd like to have us play anything special for you, Just knock on that wall three times. You get it? One, two-- d[''Tiger Rag'? Continues ] d[''Tiger Rag'? Continues ] Yes, I quite understand. I don't want to criticize. But an entire week has gone by and you still have nothing on paper. I'm so sorry, but for the last week I've been going nearly crazy. A six-piece band has moved in next door to me... and the only words I can think of are ''Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger!'' I agree. That must be terrible. Still the score for the show has got to be ready in three weeks. Why don't you go away someplace where it's quiet? I'm still a stranger here. I don't know of any place to go. I've got it. Why don't you go to Atlantic City? Oh, no. I promised my mother I wouldn't. [ Chuckles ] Nobody's Inn. What-- 'A square deal--'? This looks rather good. ''Feather beds...Hot and cold running water. Peace...It's wonderful.!'? Peace? It does sound good, doesn't it? This may be just the place you're looking for. I'll give you a check with some extra for travelling expenses. Go down there and see what it's like. Drive around the block, will ya? I'll be out in just a minute. They sent that check back to me marked ''insuffcient funds.'' I know I have money in this bank. Take it to window fve. But I've had it at window fve. Window fve, please. Could I have two dollars in change, please? d d [ Whistling ] Touchy, isn't she? Yeah. Got any left for me there? Taxi! Grand Central and hurry. Nice timing. Grand Central Station, huh? Driver? Yes, miss? Try to lose this cab next to us, the one with the funny-looking man in it. We'll lose him pretty! Right here, ma'am. Give me a round-trip ticket to Tarrytown, please. d d [ Whistling ] There you are. Gimme one of those Tarrytown books. Can you get a couple of these stuck in the Albany night boat? It's a little place of my uncle's up the river. Oh, porter, will you get me a couple of magazines? Yes, ma'am. Look here! You made me lose my place. Are you following me? You certainly are. Who me? What makes you think I'm following you? You're always where I am. Oh, yeah? How do I know you're not following me? Following you? Yeah, how 'bout that? I wouldn't be caught dead with you. Is this man annoying you, miss? He certainly is. Come on, you. Wait a minute. I'm a taxpayer. [ Bob ] I got tickets on this train. [ Knocking ] Come in. Is everything all right? Perfect, thanks. We don't have many visitors this time of year. We were expecting our nephew on the same train, but something must have held him up. That's too bad. It's too bad. Hi, Unk! Well... bust my gallatin! Hiya, boy. Sure is good to see you again, son. Where in tarnation did you drop from? Off the back of a delivery truck. Why, why-- Here's your snuff. Oh, what happened to you? Some dame accused me of being a masher. A what? A masher. How do you like that? A masher. Well, well. What's a masher? It's got nothin' to do with potatoes. She put up such a squawk, a couple of dicks ran me in. That's the trouble with women. Say, take my tip, son, and stay away from 'em. You can't stay away from this one. She keeps gettin' under my feet! What did you do with my whetstone? It's in the upstairs closet. Get it and sharpen that thing, will ya? It's so darn dull it won't even cut butter. I'll give her a lick or two. Don't do anything till you hear from me. Hey, Ruff. Come on, boy. There we go. Hi, there, old boy. [ Screams ] Help! Help! [ Unk ] Hey, what is this? Come here quick! What's the matter with her? What are you-- This man's been following me everywhere. What are you yellin' about? [ Unk ] You'd think you was being followed or something. Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Don't you dare come up here. [ Screams ] Shut up! Shut up! Will you shut up! What's the matter with you, you daffy? No, I'm not daffy. You keep following me! I wouldn't follow you if you're the last woman! Atta boy.! Why? What's wrong with me? Nothing. just said that to make you feel better. Oh, thanks. Would you mind telling me why you keep-- Why we keep bumping into each other? Who knows? Maybe it's fate like in the popular songs. It must be something. You believe in astrology? Neither do I. No. Why did you go to that bank? To cash a check. Why did you come up to this place? I live here! You bet your sweet life he does! I've lived here since I was a kid. I suppose you have every right to be here. Thank you. Why did you come here? I read an ad on a card about its being peaceful. It was... up until now. I suppose you want me to go. No, no. Uncle's business is on the fritz. You don't want to make a bum out of fate. Come on now, powder your nose. You're all broke out there. Come on. We'll have something to eat. Get off of my hand, will ya? Don't leave your hand layin' around. Darn. They had this undershirt hangin' out in a sandstorm. Scratchy, huh? Yeah. Would you like more coffee? Certainly! It's all right. And what do you do for a living? I write poetry. Poetry! That's what she said! Poetry like Longfellow. It isn't very like Longfellow. I write more for popular songs. Oh, do you write songs? I can't write music. I write words and hope to fnd music they'll ft. Well... Bob, he writes music. What kind? Oh, I dream up a few popular ditties. Nothing very good. Have you ever had anything published? No, no, not exactly. That's what takes him uptown, hoping he'll get something published. I keep tellin' him he's wasting his time. He's better off if he stays here where he can relax and keep out of trouble. Have you got a piano here? Oh, he's got an offce down near the river. Bob, why don't you take her down after dinner and have her see Arabella? Arabella! What are you talking about? Is Arabella your secretary? Arabella's his best girl. I don't have a-- Wait a minute. I'll settle it right now. Come on. You'll see her! Oh! You two try and get along. Behave yourselves. She's a sweet girl. Quiet. An old ferryboat. How romantic! Used to work too. My uncle sailed her up and down the river for 30 years. That's where I have my conservatory. Would you like to see it? You couldn't stop me. I set a fre in the stove for you, Mr. Bob. Good. Thank you. Careful now. Yes, sir, this is Arabella that uncle was ribbing me about. Pretty fancy, huh? I'm crazy about it! What kind of music do you write? Sea chanteys? I don't compose anything. Old Man River's the maestro around here. I listen to him roll along. That's where I get my inspiration. I get a few ideas off the radio too. Do you mind if I turn it on? I want to hear a program. No, not at all. Oh, look at that moon. You're talkin' shop now. It looks different up here. Do you suppose it's the same moon we have in New York? That's what everybody says, but I couldn't go for that. [ Bell Ringing ] Eight bells. I gotta take my soundings. Soundings? Mm-hmm. Come on deck. I'll show you. Oh, this is beautiful! Just like as advertised: ''Peace...It's wonderful.'' What happened? Let's see what we get. Yep, 1 6 inches. It's always 1 6 inches. Why do you do it? To humor my uncle. It's sort of a gag. He ran this boat ashore here about 20 years ago. He keeps hopin' the water will rise high enough to float her off. Hopin' is all that holds the old gent together. I know what you mean. Everybody has to have something that holds them together no matter how young or old. What holds you together? Polka dots and moonbeams? Oh, no. I guess it's the ambition to do something, be somebody. Ambition? You know what my uncle says about ambition? It's the devil in the garden of the world. He says, ''Show me a man with ambition, and I'll show you an unhappy man.'' That's what he says? That's what he says. I'll tell you what I says. You show me a man without ambition, and I'll show you a tramp. You wouldn't say that if I had my glasses off. Oh, that's what I wanted to hear. [ Radio ] One of Oliver Courtney's new numbers, ''Two Hearts Deep In Love. '? Do you know Oliver Courtney? I met him once. There's a man I admire. He hasn't been content Just to amble through life. He started from nothing and worked his way to being our leading songwriter. Oh, I think his music is wonderful. You like his music? It just makes me want to, to-- Oh, I don't know. I think he's so kind and considerate and generous. How well do you know him? Well enough to admire him. A man has to work hard to turn out as many hits as he has. You don't think it's easy, do you? No, I guess not. You don't think he got there by lying down on the job, do you? Oh, who cares how he got there. What's the difference? W-What's the matter? Oh, nothing. Oh, I just love a man with ambition. What's yours? Mine? I want to own a catboat. Is that all? Well, isn't that enough? I'd like to have a nice little 25-foot catboat... with a galley where I can cook my own groceries... and sail when I want to and where I want to. Is there anything wrong in that? No. I guess not. I just think it's the most shiftless thing I've heard of. Wait. Where do you come off telling me what's shiftless? I don't tell you what to do. It's because you don't care. Of course I don't care. Why should I care? Well, it's nice that we understand each other. Good night, Mr. Summers. Good night. Huh! Can't knock catboats to me. d d [ Whistling ] Hi, Unk. Good mornin; Bob. That's a pretty nice looking dinghy you got. What's it for, fshing? No. Sailin'? No. What for? I'm gonna fll her full of dirt and raise geraniums. I thought it'd look nice near the wheelhouse. Not a bad idea. I got a lot of lumber left over and a steam oven... and, oh, a keg of nails and-- Say, when are you gonna start building that catboat of yours? Oh, I don't know. I was thinking, it's kinda silly for a fella Just to sail around in an old catboat. Silly? What's silly about it? It's kinda shiftless. Ohh! Say... that Lane gal been talking to you again? Maybe. Maybe. Say, listen, son. Don't you pay any attention to women. Women! All they want to do is keep you working... so they can sit home and knit a lot of didoes for a lot of poor relatives. Women, ha! When Eve told Adam to climb that apple tree, that's when all the trouble started. You might be right. Yeah, you get them fool ideas out of your head... or the frst thing you know, you'll be a success... and then you won't have a minute to yourself!. d d [ Piano ] d[ Piano Continues ] d Do I want to be with you d d d [ Humming ] d Only forever d Hey, Cherry. You still up? Come on over and get out of the cold. What's that you're playing? Just a tune I've been foolin' around with. I hope it didn't keep you awake. It did, but I liked it. You know, there's something really uncanny about it. About what? You know that frst day when you said something about fate? Fate? I don't know anything about fate. I must've been kidding. Were you? I don't know if I was or not. Well, I'm awfully sorry I called you a tramp. You don't have to be sorry. I am a tramp, always will be. No, you're not. Any man who can write music like that can do anything they want to. That piece seemed to say something to me as if... well, as if you'd said it yourself. What do you got here? You don't mean you've written words to this opus already? Mm-hmm. Would you mind playing it for me? Hold it there for me, will ya? Mm-hmm. Be good if I can remember the tune, won't it? d Do I want to be with you d d As the years come and go d d Only forever d d If you care to know d That's good, Cherry. d Would I grant all your wishes d d And be proud of the task d d Only forever d d If someone should ask d d How long would it take me d d To be near if you beckoned d d Offhand I would fgure d d Less than a second d d Do you think I'll remember d d How you looked when you smiled d d Only forever d d That's putting it mild d d ''Less than a second.'' Gee, I love that line, Cherry. Bob? Hmm? Let's not ever part with this song. It's sort of personal to us. Part with it? Oh, Cherry, I should say not. From now on, this song's going to be strictly ours. Do you really mean that? I never meant anything more in my whole life. Get around this way. The moon gets in my eyes. ''The moon gets in my eyes.'' That's a great title for a song! What do I do with my empty arms? ''Empty arms''? Bob, that's two titles in a row! You could do this on your own time. I'm about to lay my heart at your feet. Haven't you ever had an inspiration and had to write it down? No, not at a time like this. I did get an inspiration once, though. You remember going in a hotel lobby and you reached for the elevator button... and a fella reached over and pushed it just ahead of you? No. You don't remember that? Remember getting in an elevator and going-- You've been in an elevator? Those things go up and down. Remember getting off at the 1 5th floor-- Fifteenth floor. You mean the fresh fellow that stuck his head out the door and whistled at me? That was no fresh fellow. That was me. Do you know what they do to people in Tulsa who whistle at girls? What do they do? They scalp 'em. They do? Mm-hmm. That's still Indian country there, I guess. Yes... with reservations. Getting back to the inspiration. Do you know what happened? What? Well, sir, I ducked into my room, sat at my piano, and then I wrote-- You mean that I, the flower ofTulsa, inspired a song? That's what you did. Listen to this. d d [ Piano ] d The lighthearted gay sort of charm you display d d That's for me d The wonderful sly little trick with your eye d That's for me d What a feather in my hat if I could gratify your wish d d Do you like the movies d d And what is your favorite dish d You wrote that? For you. d The tilt of your chin-- d Hey, wait! Hey! Hey, Cherry, wait a minute. It wasn't that bad! Hey, Cherry? Hey, Cherry, let me in! Leave me alone. I never want to see you again.! What have I done? You know very well what you've done. I know nothing of the kind. I try to play a song I wrote for you... and you fly off like Scarlett O'Hara in a ft! Let me look at you. How can you stand there with that baby face and the soul of a gangster... and dare to tell me you composed that song? But I did! Suffering cats.! What's goin'on here? What's all the rumpus about? I don't know. She's gone into some sort of a whing-ding. Get the jalopy out. I'm goin' to town. A whing-ding? Gosh, I thought it was a cyclone. Whing-ding! Not breaking up a director's meeting, am I? Not at all. Come on in. Will you want me, Mr. Courtney? I shan't want you, Starbuck. I won't want you either. Hiya, thrush. Hi. Sit down, Bob. What's on your mind? Well, I want to resign. What? Resign? But you can't do that! Haven't I treated you fairly? Always used your songs? Yeah, but I haven't felt on the level with myself since I got into this racket. Lately, it's been cramping my style. I ran into a situation last night that-- Well, I don't want to be a ghost anymore. I want to be the real McCoy. Don't be so silly, Bob! You don't realize how lucky you are, how many responsibilities I take off your shoulders. Business arrangements, interviews, popularity, income tax, the headaches of being a success. While all you have to do is dream up a few tunes... and enjoy yourself at your uncle's. What's it called? Nobody's Inn. You know, Bob, you don't know-- Uh, wha-- What did you say the place was called? Nobody's Inn. It's at Tarrytown on the river. My uncle has it. Nobody's Inn. Yeah. Want a card? Feather beds. We should take a party up. My uncle's had a rough season. Yes, was there, um, anybody else up there? Yeah. That's why I want to resign. A girl came. I was tryin' to be a big man and make an impression. I played one of my songs without thinking. What? One of your songs. Thanks. A fellow's got to show off once in a while. Did she, um-- Did she like it? No. That's the funny part. She just got mad. Mr. Starbuck. I want to see Mr. Courtney. You can't see him now. He's busy. But I have to see him. Somebody's been stealing his songs. That can't be right. He'd be the frst to know. Mr. Starbuck, don't you ever take anything seriously? I've got to see him. Bates, you better get two boy scouts and a stretcher. Caught with his pants on. I thought about it all night and-- What are you doing here? I might ask you the same thing. I work here. Doin' what? Well, I-- I don't want you to get any false impressions. I've been writing lyrics for Mr. Courtney. You have? That explains a great deal. You see, I write his music. You do? Mm-hmm. Then that was really your tune? Yeah! Did you like it? By the way, what do you do around here? I suppose you think I can't write music anymore. From now on, you're gonna have a royal opportunity. What do you mean? If Miss Lane's willing, we're gonna form a partnership. Suits me. If we can write hits for you, we oughta be able to write hits for ourselves. She never wrote a hit in her life. Don't give me that. I know what she's got. That stuff belongs to me. I paid for it. Okay, but from now on-- All right! From now on, do as you please. And good luck to you, Bob, because you'll need it. Out-of-work songwriters are a dime a dozen. I've got a list in there as long as your arm. Say, Mr. Courtney, we didn't think that we oughta pull out of here... without telling you how grateful we are for the opportunity you've given us, even though you did turn out to be a rat. Well, thanks. But let me give you a little friendly warning. Cherry Lane's a clever girl. If she stays with me, she may get somewhere. I may even let her collaborate with me later. But if she goes with you and she fails and you fail, the smashing of her career will be on your head. I'll risk that. Yes, of course you'll risk it. But what about her? Where do you think your tunes will be without my name on them, without my prestige to back them up? I simply want you two to know exactly what you're doing. We know what we're doing, Mr. Courtney. It's nice to know who really did write the music I fell in love with. And I'll take a chance on him. Oh, oh, oh. Starbuck! Mr. Courtney, anytime you want me, Just holler. d d [ Piano ] d Soon the yucca blooms will grow d d And the desert winds will blow d d Then Old Paint and me will go d d We'll be there d d In the garden there's a gal d d That I'm hoping to corral d d When the moon comes over d d Madison Square d d There's a clink of cowboy feet d d Pounding Fifty-Second Street d d And the scent of fresh mesquite d d Fills the air d d And the gal I long to see d d Sits in box 1 23 d d When the moon comes over d d Madison Square d dAnd I know dIf I can win Frst prize d There'll be such a tender look d d In her eyes d d Then the yucca blooms can grow dAnd the desert winds can blow d And Old Paint can even go d d You know where d d There'll be no more beans and pork d d Because the gal owns half New York d d Yip-yip let the moon come over d d Madison Square d One more. d Soon the yucca blooms will grow d [ Phone Ringing ] d And the desert winds will blow d d Then Old Paint and me will go d Hello.

All right. d Sits in box 1 23 d All we have now is a funeral march. Yeah. That's right, Eddie. Come on. All right. Good-bye. Hey, where are you going? You can't demonstrate a song here. This is like fun in a foundry. I've heard every word. You have? How does it go? There'll be no more beans and pork, 'cause the gal owns half of New York. Let the moon come over Madison Square. That's right. How'd you like it? I think it's wonderful... but I can't use it. Oh... you can't, huh? Why not? For the simple reason I'll be sent to Sing Sing where you belong. Why don't you earn an honest living? What are you talking about? Boys, who'd the music sound like? There's no doubt. It's Oliver Courtney. What was the tune he had a little while ago? Wait a minute. d d [ Humming ] Yeah, that's it. Couple of months ago. That's right. Courtney never wrote a song like that. Wait a minute, lady. Don't argue with me. You want it straight? Yes. I don't like half-baked imitations. Okay. Oh, ah... thanks for listening. Nice listening too. d I'll take a chance on him d [ Phone Ringing ] Telephone. d[ Humming ] [ Ringing Continues ] Starbuck, telephone! [ Ringing ] Stop muttering. Why don't you articulate? d d [ Humming ] Very irritating book. Hello? Just a moment. It's Goodrich. I'm out, out, out! I'm sorry, Mr. Goodrich, Mr. Courtney is-- d d [ Humming ] d I'll take a chance on him d He says there's no use saying you're out 'cause he can hear the piano. That infernal invention, the telephone! Give it to me. Hello, Charlie! How are you? What? What? No, Charlie, I'm not trying to avoid you. Why should I? Listen to me, Charlie. This tune of yours is touched with a funeral march. This show goes into rehearsal Monday, rain or shine. Let me talk to him. Just a minute. Millie wants to talk to you. Listen, Mr. Courtney. You oughta be ashamed of yourself... treating an artist in this fashion. Millie-- Millie, don't believe everything that Charlie tells you. I have an offer to do a picture... and unless I see some music soon, I'm going to take it! Listen to me, Millie. Listen to me, Millie. Listen-- Oh! Listen, Oliver. I have a hundred thousand tied up in this production. And if Millie walks out, I'm going to sue you for every cent of it! What did he say? He says if I don't produce more music, he'll sue me. Is there anything else at the bottom of that trunk? Nothing but the old master's pencil and some very clean manuscript paper. Ah. I wonder where Summers and that girl got to. I thought you'd be wondering, so I took the trouble of calling Nobody's Inn. What did they say? Nobody's in. Oh, what's the use? I just got myself caught between the switches. It's what I get for trying to be a phony. Now I can't get back into character. You're not a phony. It's Courtney who's a phony. You can't expect the publishers to know you've been writing his stuff for the last year. What are we gonna do? Learn to have patience. Keep swingin'! Now, come on, smile. Give 'em the teeth like they do in the pictures. Like that? And what happens? Uh-huh. You just wait and see. We can't help being a success. I thought I was the coach around here with pep talks. You taken over my franchise? That's what a partner's for. We can't both be up at the same time. That's why it takes two to ride a seesaw, you know. That's a very sound observation. I'm beginning to like this partnership angle. I was thinking, if we get a break, maybe you and I could-- No, you can't do it that way. It's gotta be that way. No, you can't. Hello, chumps. Hi, boys. We're not breaking up anything, are we? We've got an idea. If you two wanna sell those songs, I think you should try a new angle. We think. Yeah, we think. New angle like what? You can't sell those songs with that mail-order accompaniment you've been playing. No? No. What you need is a good band behind you. Yeah? Meaning you fellows, huh? Well, it might give my band a break. Our band. Our band a break havin' a vocal. Mm-hmm. You weren't thinking of this right at the beginning? Oh, no. Reciprocity. Reci... who? Where'd you get that? Reciprocity. Just dug it. What else can you play outside of''Tiger Rag'' and pinochle? Anything. Yeah, anything if we can get our instruments out of-- Out of what? Hock. Oh! So that's why I've been able to get some sleep. Fine thing. Getting us all worked up and then telling us your instruments are in hock. What'd you expect to use for instruments anyhow? You gonna hum? We thought maybe you could lend us $1 0. Here it comes. I carry sort of a sinking fund for the boys to stop them from scabbing on each other... and if one goes in, why they all go in. If you give us the $1 0, they'll all get out. A musical chain gang? You know, one for all and all for one. And every man for himself. You boys must have X-ray eyes. I just got $1 0 and a quarter. Well, what have we got to lose? Ten dollars and a quarter. You can keep the quarter! Uh-uh, not so fast. I wouldn't be sucker enough to give you ten bucks till I fnd out what you can do. I'm gonna run down there and see I get my money's worth. You keep the home fres burning. You're gonna have your own band. I've had it. [ Bob ] Well, boys,you're almost to Frst base. How come? Three balls, no strikes. Here we go again. I've been in here so many times, I smell of camphor. Okay, dig out the hardware. All right, boys, but don't forget we are closed for half a day tomorrow. You're short. There's only $40 here. I'm gonna be the angel for the other ten. Yeah, give out. Wait. Let's see if you can play on those joints frst. Give us those instruments and we'll rock it and sock it. And hock it again. Come on, boys. Let's get 'em. Certainly glad to get that instrument. Do you mind if we use the shop for a little jive session? Sure, make yourself at home. Okay. They might as well. They're practically living here anyway. Every week the same thing. I guess you've had those instruments here so often... you can play 'em better than they can. Wait, I wanna hear this. d[ Instruments Tuning Up ] See if they can bounce a little. Sounds kinda longhaired. Hey, wait. d[ Dixieland ] Ah, yes, there's that good fat tone. That man's all right. What's these? Compliments of the house?

Yes! join me, but do not crowd me. Yeah! There wasn't a bandleader left a message for us, was there? No, no one's called. What do you suppose happened to Wingy and the boys? Hope they didn't get run over. Hope they're not running over a few beers. Thank goodness Mr. Westlake hasn't sent for us yet. Mr. Westlake will see you two. Up until now. Well, here we go. Don't you think we oughta stall? Can't. The man's waiting. If the band shows up, will you run 'em into Mr. Westlake's offce? A band? A little band. It's a hot combo. Run 'em right in. I can't use that number. Put it in the books anyhow. You might change your mind. Good morning, Miss Lane and Mr. Summers. Hiya. This is Mr.john Scott Trotter and his manager, Mr. Keene. How do you do? Mr. Trotter is a famous orchestra leader. Glad to know you. You're from the South. North Carolina. North Carolina! [ Auctioneer Call ] Very funny, young man. That's what the man says on the radio. Yes, we know that. This is an audition, not an auction. We better get at it. Mr. Westlake, would you mind waiting a few minutes? I have a luncheon appointment. I think I'll be running. We'd like to have you hear our song. I'd like to. I'm afraid you don't realize what an opportunity this is. Mr. Trotter is a pretty big man in the music feld. He's a pretty big man in the bay district too. You are sharp today. I was only kidding. We're all spreading out a little, you know. He don't mind. Course he doesn't. One thing I like about Mr. Trotter's music is he gives us plenty of sweet violins. Y-You like that. I like them very much indeed. I hate what is known as hot swing bands. They tear a good tune to pieces. If I had my way, I'd take all the hot swing bands... and march 'em off a cliff into the ocean. Then we'd have a better world to live in. You don't like 'em. I hate 'em. I think he does too. Well, we'll get started. You ready? It won't bother you if I play a few oompahs on the piano, will it? If it's only a few. I'll keep 'em very feathery for you. Thank you. Mr. Westlake, the band, it's here. Sorry, we're late. Just a minute, boys. I want to-- What's going on here? Does this roof leak? It's a little surprise I had for you. I don't like surprises. They're gonna accompany Miss Lane. Here's a place of my uncle's up on the river. You'll like this place. It's got hot and cold running water. Run up there someday. I'll get the boys organized. Johnny, I'm not responsible for this. Phil, this may be good. Can you play sweet? I'll think sweet; but when it gets down here, it regurgitates. Does which? Regurgitates. Where'd you get that? Ah,just dug it. See that it don't. Keep it sweet. You ready to hear this? I'm ready, but not willing. Okay, honey. Not too rugged, men. Okay. d Can you see that I'm unhappy d d Can you tell that things are bad d d Of course you know what happened d d To the best friend I ever had d d Ain't it a shame about Mame d d She has only herself to blame d d She can't go to the picnics d d In Hooligan's Grove d d No corned beef and cabbage d d Is cooked on her stove d d She married Sir Reginald What's-His-Name d d Ain't it a shame Poor Mame d d Ain't it a crime what she did d d Sure she's only a crazy kid d d Now she has to talk fancy d d And eat caviar d d And look like those pictures d d In Harper's Bazaar d d And try to fnd happiness Just the same d d Ain't it a shame Poor Mame d d Now she has to be social d d Has to go to the nightclubs d d Has to dance like a Cuban and still act like a lady d d Oh, to think that a child of Mike O'Grady d d Would marry Sir Reginald What's-His-Name d d Ain't it a shame about Mame d How 'bout that? d Ain't it a shame about Mame d d Now she's lost all her spark and flame d d She wears sables instead of a skirt and a blouse d d And has to keep shoes on when she's in the house d d She married Sir Reginald What's-His-Name d d Ain't it a shame d d Looks like a frame d d How did he tame poor Mame d d There you are. That was swell. Ain't it a shame we didn't know about her before. It certainly is. Band wasn't too hot, was it? Well, maybe not. Personally, I think it's the best song Mr. Summers has ever written. Time. Time. We wrote that together. I wasn't referring to the number so much as I was the way you put it across. Have you ever considered nightclub work, Miss Lane? As a singer? Naturally. I've never sung before people except in school. Even then, they hid me behind a fern. That was a big mistake. [ Westlake ] Any girl as attractive as you are should go a long way in this town. Let's make a date for a tryout. - With my band? - No, maestro. My boys read music. Oh... back to the pawnshop, boys. What do you say? Well, thanks. But I don't wanna be a nightclub singer. I belong to the team of Lane and Summers. We're songwriters. We sort of go together like ham and eggs. Just a minute, Cherry. Looks like they want the eggs and not the ham. This is a big town, a tough town. If you get a chance, grab it. What kind of money can you pay her? I don't wanna do it. Mr. Westlake, I'm sorry you don't like the song, but that's all we came here to sell. If you ever change your mind, you can get in touch with me through Mr. Westlake. Phil, good-bye. Good-bye,johnny. Good-bye. Lots of luck. Watch your weight. Miss Lane, I'm afraid you've turned down a pretty nice offer. And, Summers, I'd like to give you a word of advice. Yeah? If I were you, I'd try to develop a style of my own... because you're not going to get far imitating a composer as well known as-- As Oliver Courtney. Exactly. Well, thank you very much. You're welcome. Good luck. You know the way those fellows went for you, it looks like you oughta be in that kind of work. Funny I never thought of that before. Bob, I don't want to be a nightclub singer. That isn't what I came to New York for. I don't want to be a ghostwriter either. I'd just as soon sail in my catboat and look up at the blue sky. But things aren't arranged that way. Look, honey, I know what you're trying to do. You just don't want to leave me out on a limb. I appreciate it, but I got mixed-up into this Courtney business... and I'll get out the way I got in. What's the use discussing it? I haven't an evening gown and I haven't paid the rent. I guess it's all a pipe dream anyway. Run along home and get a little rest. Rest? Listen, we're going home and work. I don't feel like work. You go ahead and I'll see you later. I got something I wanna do. Good-bye. Bob Summers is here. Oh, Summers! Oh! Show him in. Show him in. d d [ Humming ] Okay, Bob. Hello, Mr. Courtney. Hello, Bob. How are you? If you want me, I'll be right here. Okay. Won't you sit down? I can only stay a couple minutes. I found out you were right and I was wrong. Didn't work out, eh, Bob? Sorry. Really am sorry. But I did warn you, didn't I? I don't need sympathy. What I need's a couple hundred bucks... fast. How 'bout taking me back? Well, Bob, after all I-- Uh, well, I-- I might be able to use you for a couple of weeks. Can you make it four weeks? Four weeks is a long ti-- How do I know you wouldn't run off on me again? I've learned my lesson. Oh. No, Bob, I can't take the chance. I've got to know where my music is coming from. I'll tell you what I wanted to do. Got a song here that Cherry and I wrote. We did it together. I think it's the best thing we've done. I'd like to put it up with you as security if you'll put up the dough. ''Only Forever.'' That's a nice title. I'm not selling you this. When I've delivered, I'm to get it back. ''Here's the evening dress you need... ''and a little change for extras. ''Now go in there and win. I'm going back to Arabella where I belong.'' d Each day d djust about sunset d d I watch you passing my door d d It's all I can do d d Not to run to you d d But I don't want to cry anymore d d Night time d d When there is moonlight d d The same old moon we knew before d d It's all I can do not to run to you d d But I don't want to cry anymore d d All that I've known about happiness d d Darling, is being with you d d Then I would fnd myself losing my mind d d Over some careless thing you'd do d d Why d d Can't I forget you d d I know so well d djust what's in store d d A moment or two d d In the clouds with you d d Then back where I was before d d But d d I don't want to cry d d Anymore d d Where did she come from? I don't know, Mr. Goodrich. She's new tonight. Bring me a phone. Yes, sir, right away. Thank you. There's a kink in this and for two years I've been trying to fnd it. Say, Unk. Tell me something, will ya, man to man. Shoot. Suppose you took $200 advance payment. Then you spent the $200 and couldn't deliver. What would you do? That depends on what you promised to deliver. If it was eggs-- Not eggs. It's music. My sister's cat's kittens! What's eatin' you? Why, you can produce music like a hog sweatin' lard. Not anymore, I can't. Run aground in a fog, eh? Somethin' like that. I seem to be goin' in circles. I can't write, I can't think, I can't do anything. And you need $200? I do if I'm gonna save a song that we wrote together. Well, I guess I could dig up the $200 for you... if I could only remember where I hid it. Where's Courtney? Well, well, well. If it isn't our old friend Charlie Goodrich. Where have you been keeping yourself? Listen. I've been trying to get Courtney on the phone all morning. I demand to know where he is! He's out. Then I'll stick here until he gets back. You'll have a long wait. He's out communing with nature... where the stiff breezes blow. He composes best that way. Is anything the matter? Millie's walked out! She took a plane to Hollywood. Well, our loss is Hollywood's... loss. You mean, it's my loss! And it's all on account of that loafer Courtney. I'm going to sue him for every cent of my investment! You can't sue Courtney. Oh, can't I? He's lived up to his end. He's written one of the best scores since Show Boat. Then why haven't I heard it? I know I shouldn't do this. I'll get fred sure. Come on. I'll play you some of his tunes. Here's a great idea of Courtney's. A lullaby to a monster. Monster? Yeah, a dragon. A dragon coos to its little dragonette. Dragonette? Watch. d d [ A Funeral March ] d Coo, coo, coo d Wait a minute. Oh, you know that one. He's got a great idea for a ballet though. Ballet? Yeah, a prison break. d d [ Classical ] And here's where the prison guard comes into the warden's offce and says, ''Have you got that reprise from the governor?'' Reprise? So he reprises it. d d [ Classical ] What's the matter? You can't whistle it. Here's something even a baby can whistle. Why don't you whistle it? How can you whistle that? Can't Courtney write better? Frankly, no. But he's got a love song so sweet, so tender. He really poured his heart into this one. Listen to this one. You can't fool me. That's ''Old Blackjoe.'' Oh, no it isn't. It's ''Carry Me Back To Old Virginia.'' It's ''Old Blackjoe.'' Whatever it is, Courtney wrote it frst. Hmph! Just as I thought. He hasn't got anything down on paper. As a matter of fact, he has. Here's something of his I discovered this morning. ''Only Forever.'' ''Only Forever.'' You wanna hear me play it? No, thanks. The way you play things, they all sound alike! Where are you going with that? I'm gonna let Trotter try this out at the Club Monaco. And by the way, tell Courtney I think I've found a new girl for the show. [ Coughs, Hums ] Nervous? Goose pimples. You've got nothing to worry about after last night. Goodrich was absolutely crazy about you. Did he really like me? He thought it was wonderful. To prove it, he brought this new tune for you to try. It's by Courtney. Courtney? Yes. And if Goodrich likes the way you do it, he's gonna use you in the show. I ran it over with the boys and... I think it's right down your alley. Yes, it is. Right down my alley. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the radio audience. We bring you now to exclusive Club Monaco... where you'll be entertained with a half hour of dance music... played byjohn Scott Trotter and his orchestra. Trotter's music is famous for its smoothness... Just as Kelso's Cucumber Cream is famous the world over... for the smoothness it imparts to milady's neck and hands. Scientists agree that Kelso's Cucumber Cream, if used regularly-- Oh,jean. Seen Mr. Goodrich? Why, he's uh-- Oh, yes. Thank you. Charlie, can I speak to you for a minute? Hello, Oliver. Come along please Just a minute. Charlie, I want that song that you took this afternoon. You do, do you? That song belongs to me. I've paid you good money to write music which so far I haven't received. Yes, but you've no right to take stuff behind my back. That song happens to belong-- That song happens to be one of the best things you've ever done. I had Trotter make an arrangement of it. And if the others turn out half as well, our troubles are over. Oh, uh-- You, uh-- You really like it? Superb. Now, Oliver, I want you to come meet our new leading lady. And now I have the pleasure of introducing Mr.john Scott Trotter. [ Trotter ] Good evening. Tonight we have a special treat. We're going to play for the frst time Mr. Courtney's new number, ''Only Forever.'' Good title, don't you think? Excellent. Thank you,john. And now just one more word about Kelso's Cucumber Cream. [ Knocking ] Come in. Miss Lane, I want you to meet Mr. Oliver Courtney. How do you do, Mr. Courtney? H-How do you do, Miss Lane? This is a very lovely song you've written. Oh... thank you. It sounds as if... as if it had come from the heart. Well, uh-- Oh, but it did.! I know it did. Very pretty compliment. If you two will excuse me, I'm expecting more guests. Come along when you're ready, Oliver. Right. I hear you're going to be our new leading lady. May I-- May I say that I'm delighted? I don't think I'm going to be your new leading lady, Mr. Courtney. Oh? Why not? Oh, because I just don't like the company I've been keeping lately. It may have been a little slow back home in Tulsa, but at least the people there are on the level. How much did you pay Bob for this song? Bob Summers came to me-- Uh, the amount was $200. ''Only Forever.'' Forever isn't very long in New York... is it? Now, Cherry, please! I'm a little nervous. Do you mind? Of course. Hey, Courtney! What's this Starbuck tells me about you using my song? Oh! Look here, Bob, there's been an awful mistake. Goodrich came to my apartment and took that song while I was out. It can't be helped. It not only can be helped, it's gonna be helped. Here's your $200. I can't think of a tune. Now, where's my song? Bob, you don't understand. It's already been announced. Then un-announce it. I want that song! I'm tired playin' second fddle while you play the czar. Miss Lane, you're on. Hurry. Don't be nervous. Bob! Cherry, what goes on here? Bob, why did you do it? Do what? Sell our song. I didn't sell it. That crook stole it. That's not true. And don't call me a crook. I'll double it! Miss Lane, hurry! They're waiting! Tell them to wait. I'm not leaving until this thing is settled. Uh-oh. Have you ever realized what a bad impression... rough, red hands make on your male escort? Kelso's Cucumber Cream does away with that. And now, I believe we're ready for that special treat Mr. Trotter promised us. Kelso's Cucumber Cream also has many other uses. It is so pure, so good, so double rich... you can even use it on salad. That's all very fancy, but you're not fooling me. I don't mind you taking bows, but this is different. I'm going out there and sound off loud! What are you going to do? Take the music off the stands and if they ask why, I'll tell them. Good for you. You can't. It's taken me 20 years to get where I am. You can't destroy that Just over one song. That song is sacred to me and Cherry. I'm sick of being your musical guinea pig. Bob, there are people outside. Come down here. Bob, you love Cherry. What's that got to do with it? Well, I was in love once. Her name was Carlotta. She was the most beautiful thing you've ever seen. I... I wrote all my best music then. Melodies seemed to come from nowhere like gifts from heaven. Success came with them. Life itself was a song. Then... then suddenly the singing stopped. [ Bob ] What happened? She died. Oh. That's too bad, Mr. Courtney. What did you do then? I couldn't write anymore. I found myself depending on ghostwriters. I hated it! But what else was I to do? I think I know how you feel. The same thing happened to me when Cherry and I split up. I'm so sorry. I... I understand too. [ Whispering ] Why don't we forget the whole thing? After all, it's only a song. Tell 'em to go ahead and play it. Ah, Bob! Thanks. And she would've thanked you too if she'd lived. Who, if she had lived? Why, Mr. Courtney was just telling us about a lady in his life. A lady? The one who died. She didn't die. She got fat. Oh! Why dream that up again? You know she married a rich spaghetti man and she swelled. Starbuck! She outflanked everybody. Well, you big, triple-distilled ham bone! That's the fnish! I'm through catching around here. Bob? Either you tell 'em who wrote the song or I'll tell 'em. Which one of us is gonna expose you? Here's your chance to be the man I thought you were. Don't take that chance! Shut up, Starbuck! Miss Lane, please! All right. I know when I'm licked. I wonder. This oughta be very confusing! [ Squeaky Voice ] Speaking of Kelso's Cucumber Cream, many engineers recommend it as a motor lubricant for your car... when your engine refuses to start on those-- And now, here at last, is Mr. Oliver Courtney. I don't know. What do you think? Let's see what he says. Ladies and gentlemen, you have always received my songs with enthusiasm. I've taken advantage of that to present to you... a new song entitled ''Only Forever.'' Which... I did not write. Oh, Bob. This song was written by a couple of youngsters... who in the past year have, uh... have shown me great promise. Such promise that I'm having them collaborate with me on my new show. He'd take a bow at his own funeral. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Cherry Lane and Bob Summers. Bob, come on. Not me. He means you. Go ahead! You asked for it. Oh, you! Hold that music. Folks, we're as surprised at this as you are. I don't know what to say except... I might mention that my uncle has a little place at Tarrytown called Nobody's Inn. He can't do that. Oh, yes he can. In a couple weeks, you'll have the chance of congratulating a newly wedded couple. Mr. Kelso's not gonna like this. Go up there. It has hot and cold running water.
