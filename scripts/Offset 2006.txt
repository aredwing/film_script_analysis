Roll up your sleeve and I'll put a tourniquet around your forearm. That's yours. - Thank you. Stop it. I'm healthy. Just wanted to see how they do it here. What do you expect? Like this. Aditu, take care of the old man. Mr. Berger's results have disappeared. - Berger? You mean Fischer. Funny. Why did I say Berger? - A Berger's stuck in your head. Sorry. - No problem. At least we have it now. You should check if it's the right one. Brindusa Herghelegiu. That's me. - Good. Let's go and register. - When is the wedding? Saturday. - This Saturday? What can I say to that? Good luck! - Thanks. The wedding will be at the registry office. Yeah, so... No, no. What are you doing? Thank you very much. Good luck. How should I act around your relatives? - Don't start that again. It'll be fine. How about this: My family stays at my apartment and I stay with you. My dad would like that. Why doesn't your mom like me? Brindusa, she's only seen one picture of you and she didn't say she didn't like you. She just asked why you wear so much make-up. I don't understand. You don't have to. Come on. I'll be back in 30 minutes. Exactly. - I have to be at the printer's at 12. Did you tell lorga we're getting married? - No, I don't want to. It's up to you. Stefan said you're expecting another German technician? Did your boyfriend send you? Do you know how much the offset machine cost me? That's not the problem. - How much? It cost me 800,000 euros. You should talk to each other. You can't bring someone to look over Stefan's shoulder. Brindusa, do you know what you're saying? Why do you accuse me of having something against Stefan? It's silly of us to argue and for you to defend the German. We're not arguing. I have nothing against him. Tell him that or let it be. I'd like him to know I don't owe him anything. It's purely professional. Cornel showed me the proofs. Stefan may be German, but he doesn't know what he's doing. And... I want the Frenchmen to be satisfied. If His Highness Stefan is unhappy, he should come and see me himself, not send you. Real men don't do that. - He didn't send me. You're acting on your own initiative? - Exactly. Sure you are. - My word of honor. I want to tell you something: In two months, Stefan will have finished here and will be back in Germany. You'll be sitting in my office and crying your eyes out. If this is his fault, I'll put him on a plane within a week. Air cargo and away with him! Oh, yeah? And who will install the machine? We'll get another German. An older, more impotent one. Good. I see you're upset. We'll talk later when you've calmed down. The phone's ringing, Ms. Secretary. Aren't you going to pick it up? Yes? The "real" expert from Germany has arrived. Tell him to come in. You stay here to translate. Welcome. What impression should he have? We have a diversified country: the ocean, the mountains, lakes, plateaus, the Western Carpathians, the forests where there are plenty of pests. But the true pests are in Parliament, as you know. The Western Carpathians. We printed it on the old machine. Much better quality than what our German expert is now producing. My French contractors mentioned you had problems installing the new machines. Please translate everything I say. What do you mean? Nothing. And don't slobber, he's wearing a ring. You're stabbing Stefan in the back. I'd love to take YOU from behind. - And you think I want that too? Is there a problem? - What? Maybe you can speak slower so that we can communicate better. Yes, sorry. Printing machines usually work perfectly for many years after being installed. It is therefore very unlikely for the problems you described to occur before the installation. After all, it's German engineering. Do you think we should speak with the German technician, Mr. Fischer? I suggested we speak with Stefan. You're just here to translate. Yes, maybe we should visit him and have a look at the machine. Good idea. He's not wearing a ring. I can't believe you checked that. All this is new. The whole area used to be a garbage dump. We utilize everything. Here's where we shred our paper according to European standards. What did he say? - Sorry, I wasn't listening. That's the new offset machine. And that's Ms. Secretary's boyfriend. I'm Stefan Fischer, may I help you? - Peter Gross, technical consultant. I'm the one everyone's afraid of. - Yes. This is Cornel Codreanu. He's worked here for 35 years. The young lady told me you have some problems. The young lady's Brindusa Herghelegiu and we're getting married on Saturday. What's he saying? Congratulations. Well done. - Thank you. The German-Romanian friendship is bearing fruit. So, like I told you... Those are the... ...and this here. They should look the same, but these ones have too much blue. The same films, the same printing plate, but the results differ. What's wrong? You're not translating. He said... - I understood. What ink do you use, American or European SWOP? - That's the problem: American SWOP. I told him 100 times. Don't give me all that European and American shit. Find out why the machine isn't working. Cornel, what kind of ink is it? - German. You see? Made in Germany, not America. You know what I think? You're conspiring against me because I don't speak German. And you... You above all have made yourself indispensable so that you can control the machine. That's why you're against an inspection! Please calm down. He said you're against Mr. Gross's inspection. - Why would I be? You see? The blue, that's the problem! I'm not a technician, but I can see it's the reel. Hands off! Don't touch me! How can you do this to me, Brindusa? It's going to burn. Would it have been so hard to tell me you're getting married? Why did I have to find out like this? Forgive me. Why are you getting married? You said I'm free. - But not that you can get married! You're young, a little experience can't hurt. But I didn't say: "Brindusa, get married". You're married too. - I'm talking about loyalty, stupid! You could have told me. What if I'd found out on Monday that you got married? We wanted to keep it a secret. - That didn't work out. It's over and done with. That's why I didn't want to tell you. Look at how you're reacting. It hurts when you lie to me. Leave as soon as possible. Quit without notice, I don't care. I can't take it anymore, you've lived with this German for three months now. Yes, three months. "Mrs. Fischer?" Okay, I'll leave. What will I do without you? You're my secretary. Saturday is three days away. Nini. Nini. Look at me, please. Try to understand me, too. Sorry. Christina told me you're here. I just finished up. Come quickly. Son of a bitch. Wow, look at this. Really, come here. It's crazy. Is it that bad? - Yes. That bad? - Come, quick. I have to go. No. - My taxi is coming. The coffee's ready. Orange juice is on the table. Delicious orange juice. There's cheese, salami and stuff in the fridge. When you're ready, put your toothbrush, slippers and stuff in the bag in the hallway. Don't forget your suit, the rings and to pick up your family. I won't. And if there are any problems, call me on my cell phone. Your radio waves don't bother me. I love you. - I love you, too. Yes? Good morning, Mr. Gross. No, I have to pick my family up from the airport. If it'll only take ten minutes, I'll drop round. How does 1 or 1:30pm sound? Okay, no problem. See you later. I'll tell you one thing, Miss: The haves will always have more than the have-nots... Not even an ox feels at home with a pauper. If we want to overcome this poverty... Look at these streets! ...we should only buy goods that are produced here, not Mercedes, Adidas... Where do you want to get out exactly? At the main entrance. Yes? - Herghelegiu. Come on up. Good morning. Excuse me. Come on in. Good morning. I'm alone. Hello, Stefan. Good morning. Hello. Good morning. Excuse me. - No problem. I'll be there in a second. Are those the two bags? Yes. Thanks for letting me stay with you a few days. I'm sorry to disturb you. No, wait. I just have to put my trousers on. Help? No, I can carry them alone. I'm not an old granddad. Wait, the telephone. Yes. Iris, hello. No. When you come into the airport hall, you'll see me. Of course I'm picking you up. How are Mom and Dad doing? Certainly not. What do you mean, hotel? You're staying here and I'll stay with Brindusa. I'm looking forward to it. See you soon. Have a good flight. Bye. Mr. Herghelegiu? This is how it's normally done: first you try... You try to have a normal delivery. In my case, they gave me injections and everything else to keep me on the delivery table for nine hours. I was in labor for nine hours. I thought I was going to die. - And then what? Nothing. There were complications, my body rejected the stitches. There was swelling. They didn't want to leave me with an ugly scar, but there was nothing they could do, the pus had to be removed. Everything's okay now. Here, let me show you. Touch it. It feels so soft. He's trying to flirt with me. Yes? Immediately. ...yielded profits for the last ten years. Great, Mr. lorga! You're spoiling us. We do have something to celebrate. By the color, it looks like cognac. Or a really excellent whisky. Thank you, I'll do that. Do you need anything else? Good afternoon, Mr. Gross. - Hello. I inspected the machine again this morning. In my opinion, it works perfectly... when you use the correct ink. That's what I said. - Right. This was printed with "Akzo Nobel", European SWOP. Perfect, right? - Right. Yes, and why didn't you insist on using it? I did, but they didn't have any left. Weird. They gave me some right away. Whatever. Is there anything else? I had the feeling that you and lorga don't like each other. The chemistry isn't right. The ink isn't right. Very funny. Hello, Stefan. - Hi, honey. Ask him if he liked the restaurant. I particularly liked the waitresses. He says he liked the waitresses. We want to speak with Mr. lorga. He's still with the French investors. Is it urgent? Well... - What did he say? They want to see lorga. We'll wait. - I have to pick up my parents, but first I have to go to the tailor's. - You haven't picked up your suit yet? I'm already on my way. - I hope you get it all done. You ate my chocolate. Sorry. I'll bring you a box, two boxes from the airport. I promise. See you. Why don't you ask Mr. Gross if he'd like to come to dinner? Yes, of course. Have you got time tomorrow evening? Brindusa will give you directions. He ate my chocolate. - What did you say? He ate my chocolate. Not bad. - Not at all. We just have to get the details straight. Christina. - Yes? Show them Bucharest, the landmarks of our fatherland: museums, parks, scenic side streets, whatever they want. Don't let them get drunk. Tomorrow they're going to sign. Making progress, Mr. Gross? - Yes, fine. We're having dinner together tonight. I'll give you my report then. This way, gentlemen. Follow me. Cornel, take them to the machine. Please tell him I'd like to discuss my report with him. I don't know if you're interested, still interested, but... I buttered up the Frenchmen today. Tomorrow they're going to sign. What's this? Brindusa, please, what's going on? Mr. Gross would like to discuss his inspection results with you. You should call your resignation an admission. "Mr. Gross would like"... You're so observant. Tell him I don't give a fucking rat's ass about his inspection. Don't you think the Germans smell like old cheese? Why are you talking like that? And? What's happening? He understood me. - You laugh like a fool! What's wrong? What did he say? Nothing... He's just very busy today. Sorry that I behaved that way. Please forgive me. I'm ill because I miss you so much. You're torturing me. Nini, we're not alone. So, let's turn our attention to Mr. Gross's problems. Right, fatty? Did you know that your name means "fat" in Romanian? Grab him and bring him to my office. Mr. lorga will see you now. Thanks a lot. Paderborn airport is much nicer. This looks like a bus station. I don't think so. It's a nice hall, look at the dome. - A bus station. I saw him first! - No, I did! You've grown so much. Wow! Hello. I'm so happy you and your girls made it. - I hope it's worth it. - Of course. Stefan. Hi, Dad. - How are you, my boy? I'm last again, of course. - The last will be first. Give me your suitcase. - I'm not that fragile. You can take mine. - Okay. Welcome to the Paris of the East. I hope you like it. - Me too. Is that a Romanian car? - Yes. The airport's not that bad. I think we built it. We? - Yes. Iris and the kids in the back with me, Dad's up front. - We don't have any room. - I can't see. What is that? - My wedding suit. Purple? - Yes. All right? - Yes. It looks terrible. Put it back. - It's Stefan's wedding dress. Yeah, yeah. Nobody told us to use different ink. That can't be. Mr. Fischer... How do you say "for 500 years"? I'm glad we understand each other. Mr. lorga is glad you're in agreement. I hope we're in agreement. One moment, Costel. Excuse me for a second. By the way, when is the dinner tonight? At seven. I'll write down the address for you. That'll be it, Mr. Gross. It was a pleasure. Good-bye. Get well soon. Costel, you can go now. Leave me. I'm not holding you back. To symbolize my respect for your decision... ...this is my farewell gift to you. Because it's... an expensive Jaeger, don't tell Stefan I gave it to you. That would bother him. It's terribly cold. Be careful. It's slippery and there's no salt. - To the left. Here? - Yes. Left? - Here. - Yes! I know left from right. Dammit. Sorry. Mom, I'm so hungry. Iris, I'll go help Mom and Dad. - I'm thirsty. There's cola in the fridge. - Oh, yes. Cola! Don't you have anything else? - Thank God you're not on the top floor. Let me help you. - Too late, as usual. I'm already here. Ernst, we've arrived. Ernst? - Oh, no. Not now. - Ernst! Iris, Stefan, come quickly. Dad's in trouble. Ernst, what's wrong? You're always making us worry. - Yes, yes. What a great start. I need water. Where's the kitchen? Don't you have a kitchen? - Back there. Now you're okay. Jeez! Grandpa doesn't feel well. You don't understand the language anyway. Mom, I'm hungry. - Me, too. Brats. - Now you're okay. Those stairs almost killed me. We should've waited for the elevator. You trust Romanian elevators? Not me. Where's Stefan? Isn't your Romanian fiance here? How long does she have to work? She's still at the office. She'll be here any minute. - Good. Let's see what's in the fridge. Do you want some tea? No, thanks. Wait, yes I do. There's only milk, butter and a bit of cheese. Brindusa can bring us something. - We could order a pizza. Or we could go to a restaurant. Mom... - Where's the toilet? First door on the right. - Thanks. Her cell phone is off. Eat whatever's there. Go and sit down. I'll bring you something. You won't starve. There's no lock on the door? No, but clean towels, Mom. There's a difference between clean and clean. Who knows WHAT your towels are. I do. - Ernst and I will sleep on the couch, Iris and the girls over there. I've brought sheets. A terrific start. Hello, we've been waiting. - Hello. You must be Barbara and Steffi. - Steffi and Barbara. Right. I'm Brindusa. Stefan said "Brindusa" means crocus. Did he? He's right. Mom, the crocus is here. - Mom, the crocus is here. Where have you been? At the office. Where else? I tried to call you several times. Good evening. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm Mr. Fischer. Pleased to meet you. Brindusa Herghelegiu. Good evening. I'm Stefan's mother. That's Iris, his sister. You've already met my grandchildren. Don't worry, we're just a traditional German family. It's not contagious. - What does that mean? Take a seat. Sorry. - No problem. Stefan, don't you want to warm up some pizza for her? She must be hungry. No, I'm not hungry, thanks. - There's nothing left anyway. How was your flight? The airlines aren't what they used to be. There was no food. And you have to pay for the drinks. Sorry there's no food left, but we didn't want the children to starve just because you're late. She speaks with hardly any accent. - Very nice. Did you learn German at school? - Yes. There's a lyceum in Bucharest where the classes are in German. It's important not to make grammar mistakes. Mom, cut it out. - That's the way it is. I'm tired, let's go. Why did you look through my handbag? You shouldn't rummage through my stuff. I thought it might be an important call. Why can't you understand that I don't want you rummaging through my stuff? I don't know. Call it jealousy, whatever... You did the same thing with my chocolate. Just a second. This one, or this one? They're not mine. Hello, Daddy. - Brindusa? Yes. Ah, Stefan... Come and look at this, kids. Tell him I'm preparing it for your parents-in-law. It's for your parents. - Okay. It didn't have any roe. He's really giving his best. Where are my things? I want to have a shower. Where is our stuff? - In the bedroom. I'll show you. - Okay. Nicu. Nicu! What the fuck do you want? You see me here. Why the fuck are you knocking? I'm here, my dear. I love you too, but please leave me in peace. I broke it off for good with Nini. Say what you want about him, but no one has ever given me so many flowers. And such beautiful ones. I'm going to learn German in my old age. You smell like fish. Even if it hurts me to know you'll be far away, it gives me strength to know you'll be happy there, far away from that bastard. It hurts me to see your longing. You're totally crazy. It tastes revolting. Can't you leave that at home? It can get stolen here, Iris. Besides, it costs three times as much in foreign countries, even when someone calls you. This is Iris Fischer-Weiland. Stefan, what's the matter? You sound upset. Yes. That's fine. Don't worry, yes, no problem. Talk to you later. Bye. Was that Stefan? - Yes, he has a problem at work. We have to take a taxi. He's meeting us later. No way, that's much too expensive. Who knows where it would take us. We're walking. - We're walking! Because it's healthy! - Exactly. Ernst! Have you picked up the rings? - At five. What's your problem? Why didn't you leave your cell phone on? The battery was empty. I have olives filled with red peppers, caviar, cream cheese and salami. At home we have the fish. My dad has bought wine. What's the matter? Has something happened? Have you broken up with lorga? Stefan, I told you that it's over. Do you love him? Where did you come up with such a dumb question? lorga told me he slept with you in his office yesterday. That's why. Stop the car, I'm getting out. Stop the car, I'm getting out. Brindusa, wait! Hey! - Leave me alone! Brindusa. - Please leave me alone! You believe him. All the time we spent together means nothing to you. He's crazy, touchy, and wants us to break up. That's why he said that. He offered me money to leave you. He'd do anything to get me back. Hello? Iris. Did you get lost? Tell the taxi driver "Block Eva". You'll find it from there. Don't worry. See you later. When you two broke up, you should have quit and left the company. It's true, I did sleep with him after I met you. Did you do it after we were together? Yes. Once or twice directly afterwards. Is that important? Is your affair with him over for good? That's all I want to know. Of course. How can you even question that? Daddy, I'm home. - A big kiss! What do you say? - Fantastic. I bought the groceries. Thank you. "Stefan, my heart's choice". "Brindusa, my heart's choice". Did you buy olives and anchovies? And capers? Oh, there they are. Bravo. Bravo! They're a little crazy here. Totally wacko. Just like that guy. Look, it's up there. Mom... - Where is it? - Don't rush like that. The two of us, Stefan, parents-in-law plus daughter, the two children, eight. The German, nine. One, two, three, four, five, six. Brindusa, have you set the table for six? I have to pick up the cake I ordered. Isn't it too late? - No, it's not. One taxi to 19 Clucerului Street, please. I'll be waiting. Maybe no one's home. It's open, it's open. Oh, I thought it was Brindusa. Come in, come in. Stefan... - Yes. Go ahead. - Please excuse me. Wait one second and I'll get dressed. Where is Brindusa? She went to pick up the cake. Cake, cake. Yes, here it is. Please wait here. - No problem. It won't take long. Thanks. Where is Brindusa? She's buying something. - Cake. "Gteau, Torte, tarte": cake. "Le morceau de gteau". Every student learns that in French class. Sit down, I'll get us something to drink. Sit down? We can't just sit down. They must have a seating plan or something. Of course. Forgive me. Herghelegiu. Brindusa told me you speak French? Yes, that's right. I'm Mr. Fischer. This is my wife, Heidi. There's a brand of chocolate here called Heidi. Chocolate? Ah, Hei-di, Hei-di... And this is my daughter, Iris. Of course, the sister. How pretty! They look just like you. They look just like each other. Here you go. - Thanks. That wasn't necessary. I don't understand a thing. Taste it and tell me what you think. Not very strong. I'd say Romanian artichoke schnapps. This "tuica" is typical of Romania. I made it myself. Cheers! To your health. I've already told you once: You're not coming in. I spoke with Nini, he's expecting me. Slut. Please. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, you backstabbing whore? I didn't open it for her. Then why are you so worked up? - Why did you let her in? You promised me she wouldn't come here anymore. Stefan, open the door. Mr. Gross, good, come on in. This is Peter Gross, a colleague. - Welcome to our home. Shall we use our first names? Stefan. "Gefllte Fisch". - Peter. Am I pronouncing it right? Sorry I'm so late, I was with the Frenchmen. It's a Jewish specialty. A Jewish fish! Jews prepare this fish in a very delicious way. In Romania we call it "Stiuca". Do you know what the Stukas are? - Yes. I never thought you'd sink to this level. You couldn't get any lower. It was a mistake for me to accept this. Nicu, you promised me. What do you want? Should I put bolts on every door? Stay out! Nicu, please don't stay with her alone. Don't you dare open it or I'll stomp on you like a worm. Nicu, let's make up. Why do you treat her like that? What have I done to you? You wanted Stefan and me to break up but you didn't succeed. We're getting married, going to Germany and you'll never see me again. Congratulations. How could you say we slept together yesterday? Why did you lie? I didn't. We did sleep together. I slept with you? Are you crazy? No, I'm not crazy. When did I sleep with you yesterday? Nicu? I've calmed down. End this affair. I'm going to lie down and then we'll talk. Okay, Feli. Take care, Nini. - Stay for five more minutes. No. They say he who eats the head becomes wiser, but that's not true. Give it to me. - No, it's mine. There she is. Good evening. Sorry I'm late. I had to get the cake. My father had forgotten it. We still have fish for you. Thanks, but I'm not hungry. I don't feel too well. The flowers are very beautiful. Peter brought them. - Peter? Mr. Gross. I would have liked to bring you crocuses. We brought the other ones. Romania isn't poor. Our culture is rich. Speak Romanian, I'll translate. - Okay. We may be poor, but Europe can profit from our multi-faceted culture. Yes. Joining Europe is not only a financial problem. It's not enough for you to want to be members. Joining the European... Was it difficult not having a mother, Brindusa? Mihai Eminescu, our National Poet. Your father told me he raised you alone. Brindusa is busy right now. My parents got divorced when I was three and my mother moved to Italy. With an Italian? That must have been very hard on you. I survived. "The Leopard". Have you read that terrific Italian novel? World-class literature, I tell you! It'll be hard for Romania in the EU because of its post-socialist work ethic. Right, exactly like it was for us with former East Germany. - East Germany... The fish was delicious. Do you want another piece? - No, thanks. So you've retired? Yes, two years ago. And you? Stefan said you're a university professor. I should have been, but the communists didn't allow it. No, thank you. Ernst, I really think we should go. Where are the children? They have to go to bed. It's late. When they're not screaming, they're playing. Hopefully they're not playing with brutal, Romanian metal toothpicks again. Metal. Barbara, Steffi, do you want any cake? Barbara, Steffi, there's cake. Guess who we are. Bravo, bravo! Very cute. We're leaving, Brindusa. You don't have to get up. Good-bye. Please forgive my children. They meant no harm. You're not the problem. When they play, they completely forget the world around them. Twins... Good-bye. What's wrong? What are you thinking about? About the shortcakes, if we have enough. What's wrong, my child? Everything will be all right. You're both still young. Good morning. - Good morning, Stefan. You look so handsome. I'm going to pick up my family, then we'll meet at the registry office, okay? - Yes. Good. Should I take anything with me? Should he take anything with him? - No, I'm okay. Thank you. The shortcakes and then we're ready. Come on, Brindusa. Hurry, we still have to buy flowers. I tried, but I can't stand up. My feet are trembling. Come on, I'll help you. One foot after the other. With the current level of demand, the new offset machine is being used only 30% of the time. In this fiscal year. The report isn't very positive. But not very negative either. He discovered technical and economic shortcomings. That's why, after much consideration, we've made a decision. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one. It's a no-go. These shitheads are on holiday here just to break our balls. We've decided not to sign the contract yet, but we won't forget your business, and in two months we'll reconsider it. In two months. We give you our word. "Semnal M", luliu Merca. The Elvis Presley of Romania. We just need a little time. Good morning. - Look, our son's already here. Go upstairs and get Iris to hurry up. She's still dressing the children. - And my butt's cold. The car's out front. Thank you. Brindusa is looking for you. They need your... Christina is here. Do you feel better? - Yes, much better. Thanks, I'll take this to the registration. That matches so well: orange and mauve. You're very beautiful. It's purple. Christina, Gross... Peter Gross. For 11 o'clock? - Yes. Is something wrong? - No, dear, it's all right. Fischer and Herghelegiu. Don't worry about him. Just ignore him. Everything's filthy... Hello, Mr. Gross. Good morning, beautiful lady. Did you sleep well? Yes. - No! - No! Hello, Peter. When it's over, they'll come out and we'll throw rice. That's our tradition. lorga may not like you, but he's gracing you with his presence. I won't let it bother me. Fischer, Stefan and Herghelegiu, Brindusa. Yes? - Come on, we want to begin. Please, I'd like to begin. Other couples are waiting and we don't have the whole day. Okay. We are gathered here today, to join these two young people in matrimony. We'd all like to finish this as soon as possible, so I ask you to remain silent. What's this all about? - Mr. Director! - Hello. Gentlemen, please. Faster, faster. What's he doing? Stefan, who is that? Who on earth is that, Ernst? What's his problem? I won't take up much of your time, I don't want to bore you. I have just one request: Keep your mouths shut. I came to dedicate a song to the woman I love. She can believe it or not. Please forgive me just one last time. Turn it on, Costel, song number seven. Louder. Louder! Silence! Silence. Silence... I understand, my love. I understand. He's your choice. That's enough, Costel, they're not interested. Over and done with, right? You don't remember anymore. Why don't you leave us alone? Why do you torture her, you monster? Greetings, Mr. Bubu. No, I haven't forgotten anything. Why do you even answer him? Why? Why doesn't anyone call the police? What are you trying to pull? This isn't a circus. Your pistol doesn't scare me. He doesn't understand you. Translate for me, my love. Who did you leave me for, Brindusa? For him? For a German sissy who's afraid of radio waves? Leave him alone! Did you hear that? Go, Stefan. Take Brindusa and go. Don't worry about this crazy man. He's not brave enough to shoot. Are you talking to me, Mr. Gross? You show-off son of a bitch! Are you talking to me? Who do you think you are, you idiot? My dick speaks through her mouth. You come to my country, I receive and entertain you, and you slither into my bed and steal my love! I treat you like my son and you repay me by marrying Brindusa? In my country? And in Brindusa's? Nicu lorga will never allow that. I've never loved anyone like you, you heartless bitch. I cannot accept your betrayal. It challenges my dignity as a man and as the head of a family. No, let her be! No! Florin, you drive. I'm going with him. Get out! I knew it. Didn't I say it? You always said something would go wrong. Are the kids okay? - Yes, don't worry about them. How terrible. Just calm down. - I want to go home. - You're going home. I kept saying so. - You're right, you kept saying so. Oh, Stefan. Yes. Heidi, Heidi? I'm calm now. Go, please. Leave me in peace. Why are you speaking Romanian? Go back to Germany. Go. Go. Does it still hurt? Not so bad. They'll fix me up in Germany.
