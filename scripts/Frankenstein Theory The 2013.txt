My parents were diplomats. I attended GDS, it was a private school in the city. I graduated high school when I was 16. That's impressive. Well, not really. I started early and skipped 8th grade. College was Columbia. Double major in history and chemistry. Odd combination. No, not really, not really, not when you consider my work. After college I received my Masters in European History from Oxford. I liked Oxford, I liked it a lot. That's where I met Annie. And then, uh, then here to L.A. for my Ph.D. Why Los Angeles? The department chair, Paul Zelevansky. He's, uh... He's by far the best mind in my particular area of expertise. Which is... Yes, well, that is the heart of the matter, isn't it? These letters... They changed my life. My grandfather showed them to me when I was about And since then, the subject of those letters has been the focal point of my whole life. What is the subject? Well, uh, here goes. In the novel Frankenstein, the opening narrative is told through a series of letters that a Captain Walton writes to his sister, Margaret Saville. Walton is an Arctic explorer, his ship gets trapped in the ice, somewhere in the Arctic Circle, and it is there that he meets Dr. Victor Frankenstein. He tells Walton his story. Walton then relates this same story to his sister through a series of letters. And these letters form the basis of the novel. These letters are the basis of the novel. What are you saying exactly? I'm saying that, um... I'm saying that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, the novel, is a work of non-fiction. I'm saying it's a work of non-fiction disguised as fiction. Or, or more accurately, it is a fictionalization of one of the most incredible, true events in human history. Annie, what's up? Can I talk to you, please? Yes... Um... Can I talk to you now, please? Could you excuse me for just one second, please? VICKY: Yeah, of course. No problem. [DOOR CLOSES] [WHISPERS] You want me to eavesdrop? VICKY: Yeah. Good friend. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] JONATHAN: They'll be here as long as they need to be. ANNIE: Just tell them to go please. We talked about this. You know that they gotta be here as long as they need to document me. So you can do whatever you want, and I just have to live with it? You can let them finish what they're doing and they'll leave. I don't even know what they are doing. [MOUTHING] Should we go? Maybe I should just cancel my trip. Yes, that'll be great. I guess, that's not important to you. It's absolutely what you do every single time. Don't "please" me. That has nothing to do with what we are talking about now. Fine. You know what? Fuck you. Fuck you. Do whatever the fuck you want. [WHISPERS] That's not good. VICKY: Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm sorry about that. We just got our schedules crossed. Sure, is it... Should we... take off and maybe come back tomorrow? No, no, no, no, no, no. Yes. Maybe that's not a bad idea. Sure thing, we'll do that. Okay. Okay. BRIAN: Luke, Luke. Hi! My name is Brian and I run sound on a documentary film crew our latest subject is fucking... Frankenstein! Are you fucking kidding me, Vicky? You're welcome. Oh, thank you. You have got some awesome friends. I can't wait to see where this goes, man. Do not fuck this up. Guys, do not fuck this up. I just spent an hour talking him down. What I might fuck up is his girlfriend. Oh, come on. Did you see her? What she was wearing. Hey, stop it. She and I... Looked at me. Smelled me. All right, look, guys, I don't know what's going on with her right now, 'cause she's not usually this highly strung, but we have got two days until we go to Canada and she's not going with us. So just keep it together until then, 'cause I don't know about you, but I need this job. [ENGINE STARTS] VICKY: Okay, so we're back on our way to Jonathan's. Hopefully today will go a little smoother than yesterday did. Obviously, there's some tension, between Jonathan and Anne over Jonathan's theory. I've known Jonathan since college. He always lets his work take priority over the rest of his life, it's just that right now... Sorry. Um... Where was I? You were talking about your obsessive, slightly insane friend who is looking for Frankenstein. Brian, and I say this with love, please have some respect for Jonathan. He's a friend of mine. And if that's not enough, do I need to remind you, he's paying for all of this? He has my undying respect... As does his girlfriend. Oh, my God! [TIRES SCREECHING] What the fuck! I'm so sorry. Get the fuck out of the car! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you. Get the fuck out of the car. Get the fuck out of the car! I'm sorry! BRIAN: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! VICKY: Jesus! Fucking... Okay, let's go. You sure you're okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Busy day. The Illuminati was a secret society that was founded in Ingolstadt University in the late 18th century. Now central to their work was discovering the origin of life, which they felt was the key to immortality. They worked relentlessly and they passed on information and experiments so what you have, if you can imagine it, is the greatest scientific minds in Europe building upon each generation's work. Culminating in the creation of what most people call the Frankenstein Monster. The actual creator was Johann Venkenheim, he was my grandfather's great-great-grandfather. This is Johann's lab. So what does this prove exactly? What does it... Well, it's a genetics lab. That's from my family's photo archives. That was the first of its kind. I mean, fuck Mendel, Johann was the father of modern genetics. His work predates Mendel by over half a century. While Mendel was splitting peas and fooling around with flowers, Johann was bringing something miraculous into the world. Something that's never been done before, hasn't been done since. And who do I read about in a text book? At any rate this, this lab... This is where he created him. VICKY: Can you explain that? JONATHAN: The technique? No, I can't. The technique is lost. The notes, the research destroyed. It seems that Johann and whoever assisted him, they were so frightened or appalled by what they'd created, that they destroyed everything so that the experiment could never be recreated. BRIAN: That sucks. That sucks? Yeah, it sucks. It sucks because it means no matter how much evidence I collect, no matter how much data I collect, my theory will never be accepted until I find him. And I can say now with the utmost confidence that the Frankenstein Monster is real. That he exists, and he's alive now, and I think I can find him. You know, Jonathan's theory is a lot to swallow. So I just don't want people getting a bad impression of him. But do you believe it? What exactly are you asking me here? Do you believe that there is a Frankenstein Monster? Just take that and come here. Excuse me. Don't you know he's on suspension from the University? Really? Yeah. No, I didn't know that. Well, he's embarrassed about it. Jonathan is obsessed with this bullshit theory. You know it, I know it. I mean, it's all he talks about. He barely sleeps, barely eats, barely talks to me. It is ruining him and you're helping. And you're gonna go off to the Arctic. You're gonna be in search of this Frankenstein, and you aren't gonna find him. Because to answer your question, no, he doesn't exist. You know that. But Jonathan, let me tell you he's not gonna give up. This is not gonna end well. This is the first movement of Mozart's requiem. He wrote it on his deathbed. It started out as a commission piece but ultimately ended up becoming his own requiem. So I wanted to propose a toast, if that's all right. [CLEARS THROAT] The British explorer Freya Stark once said, "There is no happiness "in the things that we believe if they're different than the things that we do." Now, tomorrow will be for me the first step in what stands to be the most important chapter of my life. It's definitely the fulfilment of a lifelong goal for me. Tomorrow, the things that I do will be in line finally with the things that I believe in. I want to thank everybody here for being a part of it. So thanks. And cheers. Cheers. Cheers. [WIND HOWLING] Okay, it took us two flights to get here, we're in Whitehorse, which is in the southern part of the Yukon. And Jonathan and Eric have gone to get the car so we'll be traveling from... By land from here on out. God, it's beautiful here. It's fucking freezing here! Well, where we're going, it's only going to get colder. Great. "O wind, if winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Let's go! VICKY: What's the plan, Jonathan? Well, right now we're going to make a quick detour, we're gonna meet up with a person of interest, and then, we're going to hit the road. We're gonna go east out of the Yukon, into the Northwest Territories. We're going to rendezvous with our guide in Deline. And then into the wild. So you were saying about the drawings, they're from a real murder? That drawing right there which is drawn by a 16-year-old boy is an actual... VICKY: This here? We know that's obviously a photocopy, but the original's in my family archives. But this is from a murder trial. In Geneva in 1802. A governess was accused of murdering a small boy, a member of the family that she worked for actually. It was my family, the Venkenheims. But I think that in reality this child was kidnapped and killed by the creature... I think I've driven past it. It should be around here somewhere. Look for 8412. Oh, no, here it is. Okay, we're here. Where is here? Uh, this is Clarence Malusky. Apparently he survived an encounter. Is he a friend of yours? Oh no. I've never actually met him. Okay. Hello. Clarence? It's Jonathan. Whoa, I'm sorry. Who the fuck are you? I'm looking for Clarence. I'm sorry, I'm Jonathan. That's me. What do you want? We're here to film the... I talked to you on the phone about filming. Oh. I guess today is the day you're coming. I guess so. Fuck you, Mike! MIKE: Fuck you, Clarence! To hell with him. [HORN BLARING] Sorry about the mess. Behind in my chores. Hi. Hello. You're pretty hot. Um, thank you. I was hoping you could just tell them... You got a boyfriend? Uh, I... Yes. Yeah? You got a boyfriend in Canada? Clarence, I think that we're all hoping... Hey, whatever you want, money man. What do you want? I was hoping that, uh, you might tell us about the encounter that you told me about? Yeah. That's some freaky ass shit, man. I was selling meth to roughnecks up in Fort Chipeywan and... I don't want to talk about it any more. Can we talk about something else? JONATHAN: No. I think we have to... I'd like it if we can talk about this. VICKY: We would really love to hear your story. What do you want to talk about? The weather. VICKY: Well, Clarence, maybe we should get back on point. You wanna talk about it, we'll fucking talk about. I was up at fucking Fort Chipeywan looking at the Northern Lights. There wasn't shit around me, nobody fucking around me but ice, snow and the goddamn lights and then some fucking guy appears. And he's fucking huge. He's huge and I'm like... You know, "Hey, man, what's going on? "What are you doing out here? You're checking out the lights?" And he starts coming at me. And he just gets bigger, and bigger, and fucking bigger. And then he looks at me like he's gonna fucking kill me, okay? And then he doesn't. He walks away, and I went home and threw up all over the place. What else? Did you talk to him? Did you say anything to him? Did you hear what I just said? This motherfucker could snap me in two. You think I'm going to ask him if he wants some mac and cheese? I'm telling you, okay, he was a person but he wasn't a person. I know that it doesn't make sense, but it does make sense. JONATHAN: It makes sense. Yes, it makes sense. Clarence, I want you to look at this. Holy shit, man! This is him. That's him! That's fucking him, man. Okay, that is weird. I'm freaking out right now. Who the fuck is this guy? You've heard of Frankenstein? That's him. Fuck, man, I was kicking it with Frankenstein! Goddamn, you are hot. So, seriously, who the fuck is this? I am being serious. That's him. It's complicated. What the fuck is going on? What do you mean? Do I look like a fucking retard? No, no, no. Why are you really here? And don't give me any of this Frankenstein bullshit. Do I look fucking stupid to you? No. Clarence, relax we're... You! Motherfucker. Who the fuck are you listening to? I'm doing sound, man. Spying on me, huh? VICKY: Clarence! It's a microphone. It's your... He's just part of my crew, Clarence. Okay, okay, okay. Fuck me. You. Empty your pockets. Empty your fucking pockets! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up. JONATHAN: Clarence, relax, please, relax. Clarence, relax, Clarence. We are not here to hurt you. Why would we want to hurt you? I don't know, man. You tell me. We don't want to. We just wanted to ask you a couple of questions. You answered them. And you did a really great job and now I think we should probably leave, we'll leave. [LAUGHING] Whoa! Whoa! Fuck, man. Whoa! That could... Okay, so everyone back... Money man, I'll tell the story. I don't even need to talk, you guys tell me some shit, you know. VICKY: If it's okay, we've got to get back on schedule. CLARENCE: Really? Fuck, guys, I'm sorry. You were just trying to do your job, man. And I'm like... I'm sorry, man. I'm fucking sorry. I'm really, really sorry. Well, that was fun. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry, all right, I did not know that that man was going to be that unstable. I really do apologize. ERIC: Unstable. I know. I know. He was just unstable. My mom's unstable. That was a meth head who pulled a gun. Yeah, and made me empty my pockets and sniffed my wallet. He sniffed his wallet. Guys, it's all right, we got great footage. We did get some really good information, some very solid information. Did we, good? You know what else we got? We got a gun pulled on us. We got a meth head sniffing our wallets and pulling guns on us. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. From the crew, thank you. Yeah, okay, so here we are in Deline. We are in the heart of the Northwest Territories now. And it's cold. I'm gonna go head off and try to meet up with our guide. He's gonna suit us up and supply us with snowmobiles and we're gonna head out. And I feel excited, because this feels like the beginning of our adventure! So, yeah... Was that good? Yeah. Okay, I'm heading out. VICKY: All right. See you in a bit. So what do you guys think of lovely Deline? I think this place sucks, worse than the last place we were in. It's definitely colder, but I don't think it sucks any worse. Totally sucks worse. No, we've hit a real, you know, consistent level volume of suck. We're in a suck downhill spiral. Guys, just cut it out. Constant suck. This is enough. [GROANS] BRIAN: Ooh, that'll be fun, snowmobiles! Okay, guys, this is our guide, Karl McCallion. Karl, this is everybody. How you doing? BRIAN: Hi, Karl. I'm Vicky Stephens, it's nice to meet you. You're making the movie, huh? That's right. Yeah, Jonathan, told me that was part of the deal, but I ain't no actor or nothin'. Oh, well, that's okay, we're not really making that kind of movie. This is a documentary. Yeah. Look, I don't mean no disrespect, but you guys don't look like you've spent much time in the wilderness. VICKY: That would be true. This ain't backyard camping, guys. It gets pretty cold up there. You wander off, you die. That simple. Now, you listen to me, you'll make your movie and we'll have a good time. You don't listen to me, things are gonna get ugly pretty quick. It's not just the cold, there's polar bear. We get close enough to the ocean maybe have to deal with some walrus. BRIAN: Walrus? Yeah, 1500 kilograms with tusks as long as your arm. BRIAN: Kilograms? Now, you're payin' me so I work for you. But up there, what I say goes. Got it? BRIAN: Sir, yes, sir! Sir, yes, sir? What? You trying to be a smart ass, or something? No. You know, I don't want to start off on the wrong foot here, guys, okay. I need you to listen to me and I don't need you to be a smart ass. We understand each other? Good. Now I'm gonna unhook those snowmobiles and put them on that truck. You guys keep warm. We'll get along fine. Nice and sturdy, you gotta shake them. Karl scares me. Oh, and that's a gun. Now he really scares me. You need any help, Karl? KARL: No. All right, boys. [WHISPERING] Luke. Luke. Luke. Get this, get this. Really. Luke, are you laughing? I fucking hate you guys. Jesus. Annie... Can I... Can I say something? Well, can I say some... Stop. Please can I... Anne... I know I didn't, I'm in the middle of nowhere. Do you want to do this right now? Really? Can I talk to you about this when I get home, please? I can't hear you, Annie... Annie, I'm losing you. I can't hear you. Annie? [SIGHS] Everything okay? Yeah. She's breaking up with me. She's moving out. I'm sorry. Whatever. Let's just go. [WIND HOWLING] What's this area over here? What's this right here. KARL: There's nothing around here. This is Potters Gulch. So it's deserted all around here. Potters Gulch. Great. That's perfect. That's where we go first. But there's nothing there I already told you. I know, that's where we're going. Here? Right here. All right, you wanna see nothing, we go there, you know. Johann wanted to cheat death. That was the point. This creature was essentially an experiment in longevity. You know, there are certain animals, that have extraordinary lifespans. Giant tortoises, for example, can live to be 300 years old. Some species of birds can live to be 200 years old, sometimes more. So, Johann, would have combined the DNA of these creatures, theoretically with human DNA. And what you would have is a creature that could live for centuries. Whose body would resist disease, would heal itself, would have immense strength, stamina and intelligence. What do you expect to have happen if you encounter it? Look, obviously, I know that it's dangerous, I know that. You think that's why Johann destroyed his notes? JONATHAN: Johann's relationship with the creature was complicated. I mean, as you can imagine, a lot of the early interaction with it was disastrous. This creature has enormous destructive potential. But we are talking about something that is intelligent, that is not a mindless monster and Johann knew this. You know, this creature that he created, this is his legacy. But this isn't about personal vindication, because within this creature, there are scientific... There are medical marvels, with incredible potential. It's not just about personal vindication. End of the road, guys. Snowmobiles from here in. Can we just leave the car here? Yeah. [WHIMPERING] [BARKING] All right, guys, gather around. You watching? This is a brake, on my right, this is the accelerator, and this is the kill switch. Pretty simple. Now just beyond the property line, we're gonna be going straight through the tundra. We're going to camp overnight. I'll get you to Potters Gulch the next day, okay? Okay. Now it's gonna be You gotta stay warm, okay? I'm sorry, is that... "20, 30 below," is that Fahrenheit or Celsius? That's Celsius. Okay, so that's like... It's really fucking cold, that's all you have to know. You sure you're up for this? Absolutely! All right, let's get you on the snowmobiles. [ENGINE STARTS] I can't zip my coat. Hey, Luke, let's hop on. Come on. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, I'm on. KARL: Potter's Gulch is right through that pass. ERIC: This is some beautiful country. Sure is. [WOLF HOWLING] What's that? Just wolves. Just wolves? They ain't interested in us. Why is that not reassuring? It's the bears you have to worry about. That's why. All right, we're gonna set up camp not far from here, so we better get going. We're losing daylight. ERIC: Man, it's cold! Hi, Vicky, it's Eric, your faithful associate producer, loyal, second camera operator. I thought I'd give you a little Easter Egg for when you start editing this. I'm out here, in the freezing cold getting you your time lapse shot... I still think Luke should be shooting this... But he's in there with the rest of you guys, warm, comfortable. Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Eric's always fine. [EXCLAIMS] Hello? Luke? Hello? Who's there? Fuck! Jesus! Luke? Hello? [EXHALES] [METAL BANGS] [ERIC SHOUTS] Oh, crap, you scared the crap out of me. Let's get inside. [WIND HOWLING] VICKY: How are you feeling about the trip so far? Oh, God, I feel great. I feel really great. I know it's gonna sound weird, but it's like I can feel his presence out here. He's out there somewhere. It's got me feeling excited... Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. It's fucking freezing. I'm pissing inside next time. I don't fucking care. I can't do. Can you? I swear to God, my penis, it shrunk, it looks like Eric's. Oh, fuck this place, it sucks here. [WOLF HOWLING] Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? I almost just got eaten! Oh, my God. Wake him up. Karl, wake up. I think you got to shoot something. Karl. Karl! What? Wolves. Close. You gotta do something. I already told you not to worry about it. But if you wake me up again, I'll throw you to 'em. [WOLVES HOWLING] Awesome fucking country. Welcome to Potters Gulch. Population, us. It's just one cabin? KARL: It's a yurt. What's a yurt? Trappers and hunters use them as shelter in the wilderness. You got your trap lines set out over couple of hundred kilometers of Arctic wilderness, you stay in the yurts scattered across your trap lines. That one's about Pretty sturdy, huh? Yeah, works for me. Beats the hell out of that stupid tent. What do you think? It makes sense. It's great. This is exactly what I was looking for. Karl, where's the nearest house or the nearest structure other than this one? Fifty, 60 kilometers. Maybe more. [ERIC WHISTLES] ERIC: This really is the middle of nowhere. It makes sense. Hey, check this out. What? Bones? That's gnarly. VICKY: Is this what I think it is? Yeah. Maybe the monster is real. All right, it's creepy. Come on, let's get the equipment inside. Okay, here goes... Oh, wow! Wow. It's not much warmer in here, is it? KARL: It will be once we get a fire going. I'll gather up some wood. Why don't you come with me? JONATHAN: Yeah. Jesus! [LAUGHING] This place gives me the creeps, man. I know. It's desolate, right? That forest is super creepy. I bet there's lots of bears and wolves, I'm sure. You go in there at night, you ain't ever coming back out. Trust me, I ain't going in there day or night. Better not. Nice sunset, eh, boys? BRIAN: We were just talking about that, Karl. For a couple of grasshoppers, you did good today. Congrats, huh, partner. LUKE: Whoa! ERIC: What? Nothing. Thought I saw something out there. Let's get inside. This place is creepy. VICKY: So, how are you feeling? Good. I feel... I feel very good. We're in the right spot, I know that. How do you know that? Ah! From the data I've collected. I can... Come on. You've been dodging this question since L.A. Have I? You have, yeah. You know you have. Complete transparency. Do you wanna look at the map I brought? I'd love to. Okay. After Johann's death, when the creature migrated into Canada, into the Arctic, vegetation would have been very sparse, specially in the winter. In some areas, it would have been totally non-existent. It would make sense that he subsisted on meat. Now, it's my theory, that he's following a large herd of caribou. Which actually makes his movements easy to trace. He's significantly north of the Arctic Circle in the summertime and then he moves south as the weather gets colder. I'm still not seeing the evidence. Where's the evidence? All right, all right, let's start with Iqaluit. Since they began keeping records in the early 20th century, they've recorded 112 homicides, and 41 disappearances. Now, based on the population size, and the time span of over 100 years, that's statistically a little bit high. But it's not anything that you'd find outside of a normal bell curve. However, when you look at unexplained homicides and disappearances, the number is 44. Of those 44 homicides and disappearances, between April and May. Bear Lake, that's few hundred miles to the south. Unexplained homicides and disappearances, 20. Of those 17, between February and March. Yellowknife. Unexplained homicides and disappearances, 74. December and February. You see what I'm saying. These statistical anomalies, these spikes in murders, they follow a migratory pattern. They're moving as the creature would move. So you're saying the thing is a serial killer? Oh. No, no. If he was intent on killing humans the numbers would be astronomical. I think these attacks are a matter of self-preservation, that's all. They're, um... They're the creature trying to protect his anonymity, his territory. BRIAN: All right, all right, fuck this. Sorry. What's wrong? This whole thing is fucked. Oh, okay, now you believe me. No, I still think your theory is complete horseshit. This is not funny anymore. I think you knew what you were getting into when you came in the crew and signed up. Hey, you're overreacting. We're sitting right here. I'm not fucking doing this. Are you kidding me? Excuse me. The last time I checked, I was paying you, isn't that right? And I'm still paying you. I'm paying you and you. Everybody here, I'm paying. So I say when somebody leaves and somebody doesn't leave. It's me who's running this ship. And if I want advice from a sound man, I will ask you. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Enough. Enough. Brian! Good Lord! You are both overreacting. Enough! Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. Jonathan, I didn't mean to say your theory is bullshit. It's really scary, where we are. We are out by ourselves, this is really not what I'm used to. So, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. Boys, why don't you have a swig of this? You won't find this in the lower 48. Can I have some? Thank you, Karl. No hard feelings. Jonathan? No hard feelings? VICKY: Karl, what do you think of Jonathan's theory, about the crime clusters? It makes sense. A predator after the caribou herd. Something that would also kill a human if it happened upon one. Wow. So you believe him? Well, the theory is dead-on. The culprit's wrong. What do you mean? He's mistaken Frankenstein for a bear. [LAUGHING] They kill at least a few people every year, probably more than what gets reported. I guess that would explain all the unsolved murders and disappearances. But I don't know, I ain't done the research. And you seem like a smart guy. I bagged a lot of big game in my day. I wouldn't mind bagging myself a Frankenstein. [LAUGHS] God! Fuck. Fuck. Yeah. I'll tell you one thing, polar bear, best damn hunter on Earth. Tigers and lions are just pussies by comparison, literally. Figuratively. Polar bear can outrun a racehorse. Can swim in ice cold water for 100 kilometers. Hold his breath underwater for 15 minutes. ERIC: You ever seen one? Hell, I've killed 12 of them. Friend of mine, I used to hunt with, Ted Meachum. He survived a polar bear attack. He's north of Churchill, that's in Manitoba. Took some weekend warriors up on a hunt, 1992. I had a bad feeling about that. The winter was mild, ice didn't freeze over till February. When it did, it was only for a few weeks. The polar bears eat seals. When the Hudson isn't frozen over, they can't hunt seals. When they can't hunt seals, they hunt something else. Anyway, old Ted took 'em out on a light plane. They had engine trouble, had to put down. Six men stranded in the tundra. A big male polar bear got the bead on them. Pulled one man out of the fuselage in the middle of the night, screaming. Dragged another through the ice. Come daylight they thought they were safe. Polar bears, like most predators, prefer the ambush, not this one, he was different. He attacked that plane dead on. Ripped apart what was left of the fuselage, killed all the remaining passengers. All except Ted. ERIC: What happened to Ted? That's the damnedest thing. He ripped off Ted's leg. I mean, just ripped it off. Ate it in front of him. But let him live. Like he was toying with him. Ted was supposed to be gone overnight. So the following day I led a search party. Got a sea plane. Spotted the wreckage. Found Ted nearly bled to death. But he did a good job with the tourniquet. I guess the bear did get him in the end though. What do you mean? He was never right after the attack. Six months later, he shot himself in the head with his Winchester. That's fucked up. Yeah. Don't fuck with the forces of nature. You better respect her, because nature doesn't forgive. Are you fucking with us? Do I look like I'm fucking with you? Whoa, easy, look. [IN HIGH VOICE] Hello. Hi, Eric. Kiss me, I want a kiss. I want a kiss, Eric. Brian, that's disgusting. JONATHAN: Let me see that. He's out there, you know. And tomorrow we'll go looking for him. But right now, I'm turning in. Now, if those wolves start up, don't you go waking me up. I'll make good on my promise. Okay. [WOLVES HOWLING] [WHISPERING] Those wolves are really freaking me out. I know. They sound closer than last night. I know. Jesus Christ. JONATHAN: Something's got them worked up. ERIC: I don't know how he sleeps through this. Karl? This is like a lullaby to him. JONATHAN: Shh, shh! Listen. ERIC: What? They just stopped. Maybe now we can get some sleep. [LOUD GROWLING] What was that? Holy shit! ERIC: Should we wake up Karl? No! We should... No. He'll kill me. JONATHAN: I think that's him. What? Really? You think so? Yes. ERIC: No way. Yes, I do. The wolves are scared of him. That's why they stopped. ERIC: It's a bear. I don't think so. Have you ever heard a bear howl at night? Do you know what it sounds like? Do you know what it sounds like? No, but it probably sounds like that. Yeah. [GROWLING] That sound like a bear to you? [GROWLING] [GROWLING] Somebody stole one of our snowmobiles last night and trashed the other one. The third one is still working. Oh, terrific. I thought we were alone out here. Well, we're obviously not. Who could have done this? Somebody was definitely here. Big fucker, too. Tracks lead over there. It's not a polar bear, or a goddamn monster. It's a man. Hey, where are you going? In 30 minutes, I'll have his ass. He didn't take any fuel, and those snowmobiles were low... I don't think you should go out there. What did you say? I said, I don't think you should go out there. Are you fucking kidding me? Karl, I just think it's a bad idea. Hey! We got a crisis on our hands right now. I need you guys to do exactly what I say. No need to panic. I'll be back soon. I understand, I don't think you should go out there. This is my country! I'll be goddamned if I let some motherfucker come in here and steal my stuff. All right? ERIC: You don't want to take the other snowmobile? And let him know I'm coming? You fucking nuts? It's been four hours since Karl left and there's been no sign of him. So I'm officially worried. Brian and Eric have volunteered to go looking for him, while the rest of us stay at the camp. ERIC: I drive this time. You film. You drive like a grandma. Great fucking trip, Vicky. We don't make it back, I want to officially go on tape as saying this country sucks and it can lick my balls. USA rules! Canada can lick 'em. Just come back in an hour whether you find Karl or not. One hour, otherwise I start to freak out. An hour, got it. You ready? I'm ready. Bye! Love you! Kisses! [SIGHS] I guess we wait. BRIAN: Hey, Eric! What? I have to get my gloves straight. Oh, my God! Oh! This whole thing is so fucked, dude. I know. What are we doing? You don't believe this shit, do you? Fuck no! But I mean... It's weird shit going on. Why, you don't believe it, do you? No. No. It's a mind fuck though. I mean, the noises last night? And the drawing? Freaky shit, right? Yeah. But no, Frankenstein is fiction. And Jonathan, for a genius, is a fucking idiot. Amen to that. They're gonna be fine, right? LUKE: I think so. Yeah. I wouldn't be worried about them. Really, it's broad daylight. I'm pretty sure the creature has developed a nocturnal way of life. He shies away from people. He's generally moving at night, sleeps during the day. They're fine. Aren't you concerned at all if he were to come here? No. Of course not. How could I be? That's been my goal the entire time. I've been clear about that, haven't I? I want this. I need this proof. I'm getting kicked out of the university. Anne told me. She did? Then you understand how much I need it. Everything I've been working on hinges on meeting him. That's the whole point of this, is to have real photographic evidence. It's the only way I'm ever gonna prove to my colleagues, to the world that I'm right. And I know I am. No doubt in my mind that I'm right. [ENGINE REVVING] Fuck me! ERIC: I don't want to go in there. You think I do? You think I want some bear to make fun of me while he eats my leg? Karl! Yo, Karl! Shit! We gotta go in there. [HEAVY BREATHING] Karl? I don't like this place. I don't either. ERIC: Oh! What? There's blood. What? Over here. Oh, Jesus! Holy shit! BRIAN: There's somebody out here with us. We have to get the fuck out of here. Let's get the fuck out of here. Right now, we got to go. Go get the fuck out of here! What the fuck is happening? [PANTING] Hey, what's up? He's dead. Karl is dead! No. What're you talking about? It's your fault, you motherfucker! No! Stop! Hey! The one guy who knows how to survive out here is dead. It's your fault! I tried to tell him. What happened? We are fucked! We tracked him into the forest. There was a goddamn bloody dead Karl. His gun was smashed next to him. His gun? Fucking gun. The Creature felt threatened. I tried to stop... What fucking creature... There's some crazy person in the forest killing people. And you're talking about Frankenstein, you psycho! What's it gonna take for you to believe me? I don't care who it is! All right! No! No! No! We are getting out of here as quickly as possible. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. Seriously? I'm on the verge of a great scientific discovery. I'm not going anywhere! Are you kidding me? Karl is dead! Something is out there. They're right, they're right, Jonathan. I know this is important to you, but we have got to go. There's a man dead, for Christ's sake! Come on, we have to go now! Let him stay here. Get your stuff. What? Go ahead. Go. With one remaining vehicle, we can't travel as a group. So Luke is going to go for help. All right, bro. Be careful. The plan is that Luke is gonna try to find the highway and flag down help. Be safe, Luke. Bye. It'll be okay. He has a great sense of direction. VICKY: It's our second night at the yurt. Luke left yesterday and we don't know where he is. We have no transportation. To be honest, I'm not even sure how to get back to the road, at this point. And, as you can hear, there's a storm blowing outside. Though I think that even if we knew the direction, we couldn't get to the road. Obviously, our cell phones don't work out here. And most concerning, Karl is dead. And we're not exactly sure how, but something is out there. Just suppose for a second it is the monster. Then what? JONATHAN: It is him. I promise you, it's him. And the only chance we have is to appeal to its humanity. What humanity? It's capable of reason, he's not some mindless animal. It reacts to fear and anger. I mean, this is something that's been searching for companionship its whole life. It's been rejected. He is intelligent, it will respond to a sympathetic hand. How? How do you know that? You're just gonna have to trust me. I don't understand how anybody could survive out there. It's so cold. Hopefully Luke will make it back. And we can expect a rescue party tomorrow. Regardless, the equipment was rented out for five days. So if we're not back in two days they'll report us as missing. They have a general idea of where we are. [LAUGHING] ERIC: What? I forgot to pay my rent. Jesus! Andrew's gonna have to cover me. He's gonna kill me. BRIAN: I can't stand it, man. I got to get out of here. Jesus! Oh, God! I can't see anything. How do you turn on the night vision? VICKY: I don't know. It's Luke's camera. [GROWLING] Oh, God, he's getting closer. I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here. [VICKY CRYING] Oh, I got it. Fuck, I can't take this. It's okay. Its going to be okay, right? Yes, its fine, don't move. He didn't attack last night. He's not going to do anything. Why's he doing that? I don't know. [CLATTERING] I think he's... I think he's warning us. He wants us to leave. I want us to leave, too. I know. [BANGING] Just... We'll be fine. Go back to sleep. [GROWLING] [VICKY CRYING] [GROWLING] [LOUD GROWL] Okay, I think we're recording. We're following Luke's tracks. We haven't seen him since... Since he left yesterday. We've been walking... I don't know how long. We don't know if Luke made it back. So, we're just... Hope we find him. Stop, stop, stop. What is that? Where? I don't see it. Over there. Brian, are you getting it? Brian, you see that? Over there. I don't know. It could be the snowmobile. VICKY: Okay. Do you see anything? Luke? There's something behind the tree. The one right by the line. Luke! Luke! What the fuck? Do you see him? Where is he? His helmet's here. Where is he? There's no key! Luke! Are those tracks? What the fuck? All right, let's do a sweep. He can't be far from here... Split up, but stay in each other's line of sight. All right? You want us to go by ourselves? Brian, cut the bullshit! I've had enough of it. There's four of us. Let's just look for him, he's got to be around here. Everyone got that? Keep each other in your sights, got it? Got it! Luke! Luke! Luke! [WIND HOWLING] Luke! Luke! [HEAVY BREATHING] Fuck! Jesus! Luke! Fuck me! Luke! Fuck... Luke! Buddy! Luke! Guys! Luke! Guys! Luke! Luke. Luke... No, no, no, no, no! [GROWLING] [BRIAN GROANS] [BONES CRACKING] ERIC: The camera's over here. VICKY: What? Where is he? No! Brian! There's some blood over here. What do you mean? Oh, Christ! No. Oh, my God! Oh, God! Dammit. What are you looking at? What is it? It's a footprint. He was here. He was definitely here. Look at this. Oh, my God! Look at the space between foot falls. It's amazing. Amazing? What's amazing is that we are in serious danger. All right? That thing took Brian. Yes, I know that. I know that. You don't think I know that? All right, listen. We go back to the yurt right away. We don't wait. We go back and wait for help. What the fuck is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? I'm sorry, but Brian is almost certainly dead. Brian is dead. If we don't leave right now, we're dead, too. What do you want to do? Go after this? No, we go to the yurt now! We wait for help. Or we wait for him to come to us. VICKY: Can you zoom in some more? ERIC: This is as close as I can go. The door is open. That's not good. [GROWLING] Jesus Christ! JONATHAN: He's in there. [LOUD GROWLING] What the fuck do we do? Well, he's... He's clearly agitated. You think? I don't think... I don't think we can approach him right now. I think it's a very bad idea. We gotta do something. It'll be night soon. We can't stay out here. We'll freeze to death. Yeah, I know that. Yeah, so get down there and talk to him. That's why we're here, right? You're the expert. You're to appeal to his humanity. Not now. He's too worked up. VICKY: We have to do something. Okay. We wait. Let's give him some time. Either, he will leave, or calm down. [CLATTERING] [GROWLING] VICKY: How much longer can he go on like this? [GROWLING] ERIC: I'm freezing. I can't feel my hands. VICKY: Here give me the camera. VICKY: You all right? ERIC: Yeah, yeah. [VICKY GASPS] ERIC: Oh, my God! VICKY: That's him isn't it? JONATHAN: Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna... I'm going to call to him. Once he comes out, he'll come to me, I'll separate myself from you. Use the night vision to find your way back to the yurt. Okay? VICKY: What about you? I don't know. Hopefully I can reason with him. [GROWLING] He went back inside, okay? Jesus, it's cold. We've got to go now. You guys ready? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I start moving, you head towards the yurt. You go quickly, but you walk. You don't run. If he heads towards you, try to stay calm. Don't run! Don't run! Oh, God! JONATHAN: Hello, I'm right here. I'm right here. I don't want to hurt you. I'm a friend. I don't wanna hurt you. A friend, I don't want to hurt you! Hello? VICKY: Okay, okay, you ready to go? Yeah, I can't. JONATHAN: Hello! No, Eric, come on! Eric, we've got to go, now! Go! [GASPS] [SCREAMS] [GROWLING] [ERIC SCREAMING] ERIC: Oh, my God! Don't stop! [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] ERIC: Vicky! [LOUD GROWL] VICKY: Think, think, think, think! [VICKY CRYING] Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! [VICKY SCREAMING] Oh, my God! Jonathan! [VICKY CRYING] [SCREAMING] JONATHAN: It's me, it's me! Oh, God! Oh, God! Jonathan! I need you to be quiet now. You gotta be very, very quiet. [WHIMPERING] That's good. That's good. Keep moving. Keep going. Okay. Don't run. Don't run! Straight ahead. That's very good. That's very good. Shh, shh! Keep going, keep going. It's straight ahead. Right in front of me. That's good. That's good. Get inside. [VICKY CRYING] I want you to stay here. I'm gonna go outside. I'll be right back. But I need you to be very quiet. Don't make a sound. JONATHAN: I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt you. I am not your enemy, do you understand? My name is Venkenheim. Yes, Venkenheim. Like your creator, like your father. I understand your pain... Let me help you. Let me help you. I've spent my whole life searching for you. You are a miracle... Don't you understand? I can see it in your eyes! You're not an animal. You're not an animal. Let me touch you. You're a miracle. [GROWLING] I don't want to hurt you. [VICKY CRYING] I just want to touch your hand. [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [CRACKING] [SCREAMING] Oh, God! Oh, God! [SCREAMING] [GROWLING] VICKY: No! No! [LOUD GROWL] If you miss the train I'm on You will know that I am gone You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles A hundred miles, a hundred miles A hundred miles, a hundred miles You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four Lord I'm 500 miles Away from home 500 miles, 500 miles 500 miles, 500 miles Lord I'm 500 miles Away from home All these years and all these roads Never led me back to you I'm always 500 miles Away from home 500 miles, 500 miles 500 miles, 500 miles Lord I'm 500 miles Away from home If you miss the train I'm on You will know that I am gone You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles
