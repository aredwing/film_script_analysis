Mac, do you think it's a sign? I'd rather think about girls! That's all you think about. Yes! Bo? Which horse will you bet on? Answer my question. The sparrow will bring you bad luck. A friend of a friend bought a flat. The flat lost 50 % market value after a sparrow flew in. He and his wife both got prostate tumors. Isn't that bad luck? Nice story, you can be a storyteller. I learned everything from you. Really? Let me take the lead today. Can you handle it? You still have a lot to learn. Sorry. Watch where you're going. Sorry Miss, are you alright? It's okay. Sound's great. Sorry. I'll get it For you. Never mind. That's Fine, I'll call you. Okay... Here's your share. It's a lot of money! This is peanuts. Ever made over $10,000 a day? The Fat guy carried big bills on him... They are Singaporean money. Trying to be smart? Think you can do better? You're not ready to lead. I want to try. Get rid of the wallets. You're not ready! I'll stash away the Foreign currencies. Had lunch yet? Yes. Drinks on me. Thank you. Come on... Bank! I win. Place your bets. Let me take you home. Drink. One more bottle. Mister... Here's your wine. Wait up. Call me. Can you take me to the city? I'll pay you. Here. What's your phone number? I'll call you. Let's go. Just had it repaired. It's yours. My mother gave it to my late wife. Time For your medicine. Set it down. Make sure Mr. Fu takes his medicine. Yes. I'm going out. What's wrong? You sound unhappy. Have you been drinking? What's wrong? Get in. Where to? Let's go to your place. I live above there. The one with curtains. I often see you. Why are the photos in black and white? Colors can be deceiving. What is it? A sparrow. Does it pick pockets like you? You two are alike. Let it be. She'll return to the cage herself. Can I have it? Yes. Promise me. Don't let anyone see these photos. What do you want? "Chung Chun Lei" What's so Funny? What's so Funny? Get to work! We are waiting for you. The bike's yours? It's a piece of crap. It's broken. Shut up. You broke it!pay for it! But it hurt my back! I'm not paying! We'll each throw in $50 For a new one. Run! Chun Lei, run! Fried rice. Mac is in the hospital getting his wound stitched up. What happened? What happened to you? What about you? Did either of you... meet a beautiful woman? Told you the sparrow brings bad luck. See? Get out. Get out... Miss, do you need help? Stay out of this. No men would want to see a woman harmed. Miss I'll do anything to protect you. It's all our fault... Sorry for getting in your way. Let's go back down. I didn't know he'd hurt you. Liar! You know they spy on you all the time. I'm sorry. Who's behind this? Mr. Fu is a good man. He treats me well. I've lived a good life these years. Everything I had was the best. He went out of his way to help me. I owe him so much. He's getting older everyday. I should take care of him. No... I should leave him. To find myself... A true love. Help me. How? Enough with the excuses. Don't drag my brothers into this. Here's your money. Where are you going? I want to make the old man pay. I'm in! We need to come up with a plan. Don't go your own ways! It's me. I'm sorry. Mr. Fu Found out... They refused to help. "Chun Lei, 9340-3777" Just go home. Why don't you go home? Think you're good? Good enough. Think you can handle it? Nothing to it. Prove it. Pick the cop's handcuffs. Piece of cake. Your sure? Officer, you dropped your cuffs. Officer, you dropped your tie. Just go home. You go home. Delivery for Dr. Chan? Yes. How much? $120 Hold the lift! Delivery. $120. Thanks. We have an appointment with Dr. Chan. Please take a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Please Fill out the Forms. Call me when Mr. Fu is finished. Yes. Please excuse me, Mr Fu. Very effective. Sorry. Excuse me. Get in. You will inherit everything I own. No point to steal. Be careful of pickpockets. There are four of them! This is Bo, leave a message... I'm Sak, I can't answer the phone right now... This is Mac, leave me a message... "Pickpockets" Mr. Fu wants to see you. If you're afraid, bring a friend, or your lawyer. Or call the cops. Mr. Fu. I'm Fu Kim Tong. My brothers didn't mean any harm. Someone set them up. Apologize. Apologize! Apologize! They were just trying to help. But this was a misunderstanding. Chun Lei can explain. Mr. Fu and I had some problems. But not anymore. I'm doing fine.Thanks For your help. Don't worry about me from now on. I'm happy. You see? Yes. Are you sure? Sure. You may go now. Thank you. Wait. I almost forgot to return your watch. Back in the days, pickpocketing required real skills. Kiddo, take a word of advice. you don't have what it takes. Understand? Yes. You guys go on. Forget about it. Listen to me. I have to prove to him what I got. What is it? Mr. Fu, how about a few words? Are you afraid of me? Get out. Lung, back off. Why would I be afraid? I came back to get even with you. Something bothers me. If she doesn't like you, you should let her go. Love can't be forced. Understand? You can take it all out on me. What kind of a man would force love. You'll lose all your reputation. You're too old to play Casanova! She deserves better. Get it? I tried to be nice to you, but you want to play. You were still in diapers when I was picking pockets. You can't afford to play this game! I don't care about your past. I just know you bully women. Shut up! I'll shut up. Let her talk. Let her say it herself. Go on. I'm sorry. Get it? I'll beat you with one hand, kiddo! If you can walk away with her passport tonight I'll let her go! If not, I'll cut off your hands. No problem. If he loses, you'll stay by my side... Until the day I die. I cut you. I am getting rusty. Come out. You can go now. Go on. Thank you. Leave. Take care. Watch your health. I know what to do. Drive. Goodbye. Hope we'll never meet again. Have a good trip. Goodbye. Easy here. Get in. To the airport. I'm going to the airport! What now? Grab lunch. Then go to work. Get going guys. Let's get going then. Give me a ride. Thank you. Keep it going. You give it a try. You're the boss... It's your turn. I don't want to take your place. You have more to learn. It's my sparrow. What sparrow? It's my sparrow. So? Be careful. Head on shot. Back to work...
