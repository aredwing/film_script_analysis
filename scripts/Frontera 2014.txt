Those stalls still need to be cleaned out. Unless you want to pay somebody else to do it? No. I'll do it. Which trail are you taking? The wash. Why do you always got to ride the damn wash? - 'Cause it's the best trail. - Yeah, it is. That's why we can't keep the damn Mexicans out of it. If I see any "damn Mexicans," I'll tell 'em hello from you. Did you bring a walkie-talkie with you? Yup! Don't leave that coffee cup out there. Shit, dude! What the hell? - We're going shooting today. - So go. Come with us, ass hat. I don't feel like shooting cactus with you two faggots today. We're not shootin' cactus today. - Come on. - Ah! You dick! Thank you. Thank you. Very. You're very welcome. The na... the name? Do you speak English? His name is Shadow. Shadow. It's okay. S, s, work. Oh. S. Yes, please. Gracias, gracias. Sorry. Okay. Good day! Good day. No shit. You guys! You guys, come here! Quick! There's some Mexicans right there in the wash. Where? - Right there by that tree right there. - I don't see 'em. Use your scope, dude. Okay, yeah, I got 'em. Yeah, those guys are definitely illegal. - How do you know for sure? - Duh, Sean. You think they're here just out for a stroll? Hand me the 06. No, dude, you can't just start shooting at those guys. I so knew you two fags would puss out on me! Look, I told you, we're only gonna scare them. You don't shoot at them. You shoot near them. - Now, give me the gun. - Screw you. Fine. I'll use this old piece of shit. Sure I don't miss and hit one of 'em. You're such a dick. Just make sure you aim way far away from them. Yeah, no shit, bozo. I'm just gonna scare 'em... back across the line. Oh! Brad, what the hell? - That last shot was way too close! - I didn't hit him, Sean! Besides, the point is to get close so it scares the shit out of them. Brad, check it out. See that big ol' jug of water? Yeah. I got it. You hit that thing, it'll scare the hell of out 'em. Plus, they won't have any water, right? Then they'll totally have to run their sorry ass back across the line. Genius. - Hey, hand me some more 06 shells, dude. - Let me take a look at this shit. Are you freaking crazy? The thing's, like, right next to them. You could totally screw that shot up! We're not using my dad's rifle to shoot that close to those guys. Oh, hey, hey, hey. It's cool, it's cool, it's cool. Look, why don't you show Kev and I what a safe distance is to be shot at? It's a killer scope on that thing. You're not gonna hit 'em. Go for it, Sean-o. You could shoot the tits off a fly. - No! - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. - Sean, you just took out that lady, man! - Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! What the hell did you shoot her for, dude? I didn't shoot her, asshole! She came over the wash! I was trying to miss the fucking Mexican! - Oh, God. - She's moving. - She's moving, dude. Look, look. - You swear to God? I swear to God. Just look. What are we gonna do? We got to get out of here. - What? We can't just leave her there! - You want to go down there, Sean? When we get back, we'll call 911 from a payphone or something. Besides, the Mexican guy was helping her! Oh, f... - Oh, what happened? - Uh... Where's Roy? Roy! My horse? Get my horse. Jose! My horse. My horse. - I-I-I get horse. - Get my horse. Shadow? Oh. Shadow. - I have horse. - All right. Hey. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Hey! Hey! Roy. - Livy. - It's all right. What are we gonna do? My dad's gonna kill me! Dude, your dad's never gonna find out unless you freak out. She looked pretty bad to me, dude. Maybe he hit her. I didn't hit her, you dick! I was aiming at the ground! Shut up, Kevin! Look, we got to swear not to tell anybody about this ever. Nobody! Because if anyone finds out, we're all screwed! I'm not. I didn't even shoot at all! It doesn't matter, dumbass. You're an accessory to the crime. - Sean's the one who shot her. - Shut up! Amigos! Okay. We're gonna have to ask you some more questions. Later. Tomorrow, I mean. Okay, I'll drive you back to the house. No, no, I got to put up Livy's horse. Roy, we can get the horse back to the barn. Nope. Uncle Roy? Really sorry, Roy.

"Henry." Habla ingls? The wife of former Medio County sheriff Roy McNary... was killed in an attack that may have been an attempt to steal her horse. The sheriff's office is looking for a man of Mexican decent, presumed to be undocumented, who was seen fleeing the scene. We will report further details as they unfold. Anyone with information regarding the tragedy, please contact the Medio County sheriff's office... - Hey, Flora... - We were watching that. Yeah, see, just move the mouse, and you put the little arrow over the picture. You can click on that. Scroll it down. I know how to use a computer, Randall. Yeah, of course you do. I mean, it's the same old thing we had when you were on the job. Okay, well, you let me know how it goes. Good morning. I'm going to be teaching the class today. Mrs. Edwards has had a family emergency. Hey, did you hear what happened? Some illegals killed Mrs. McNary. - Mrs. McNary? - She was riding on her ranch, and they were trying to steal her horse, and they killed her. Young lady in the front, please turn around. I have to use the bathroom. Si. Says he's sure. Roy's here. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on, now. Come on, back off. That's not the guy I saw. You're sure? Yeah, I'm sure. - Well, then, there may have been two. - Why do you say that? Well, we picked him up in a stolen truck, and... One of the things we found in the truck was this. You recognize this? Yeah. Soon as we told him what happened, he started talkin' pretty fast. He told us that he and another guy that he was traveling with... met up with a woman on a horse, and she gave him that blanket. He says that somebody was shooting at him, and the lady fell off her horse... - and hit her head. - That's a bunch of bullshit. I know, I'm just... just telling you what the man said, keeping you in the loop like I promised. I should have shot that son of a bitch when I had the chance. I saw that you had a firearm on you when we got there. - Were you shootin' at 'em, Roy? - No. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - There were shots. - There were shots? Yeah, they were rifle shots. That's why I went out there in the first place. Well, why the hell didn't you tell me that before? That's pretty damned important. I don't know, I... Hell, Randall, I mean, we was... All right, somethin' else. Now, our man in there I.D.'d the same guy you did in the mugs. - He did? - He did. - Hello, Matthew. - How are you, Martha? Good, good. Got that good apple wine ready for you. - That's why I'm here. - Okay. - There you go. - Thank you. - You got it. - All right. - Give my best to your wife. - I will. No. No. Oh. You're sure that's the guy you standin' over Livy, right? - Yeah, that's him. - Well, then I'd say we got our guy. Hmm. What? I don't know. Come on, Roy. How many times you and I stood here and watched these boys... lie through their teeth just so we'd send 'em back across the line - with a spanking and a warning? - A bunch. I know it's not much for comfort, and it ain't gonna bring Livy back, but... we got him, and he's gonna be punished. Did you already have your boys do a sweep? Yeah, but they didn't find anything, but now I know you heard those shots too I'm having 'em do another broader search. - Yeah, when? I told you that yesterday. - Terrence is doin' a transport, and Matthew and Lewis are pickin' up the slack, so soon. This afternoon, or early tomorrow morning, latest. - I'm gonna go. - Okay. Roy. We got him. Bueno? Paulina! Vmonos! Vamos, vamos. Hello. Vmonos. No, no, no, no, no, no. No! No! No! Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's. Leave a message after the beep. Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's. Leave a message after the beep. Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's. Leave a message after the beep. Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's. Leave a message after the beep. Hey! No, no, no. No. No, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bueno. Hi, this is Roy and Olivia's. Leave a message after the beep. Hello, I'm calling from family first funeral service. We wanted to let you know that we've completed the process, and you can pick up the ashes at your convenience. Uncle Roy? - Going for a ride? - Looks that way. Want some company? No. No, I don't. But thank you, Kaye. Thanks for offerin'. You bring that pony back wet, you'll catch hell from me. Understood? Yes, ma'am. - What are you doin' up here? - This is where the shooter was. That's got to be well over 800 yards. Are you sure it was from here? I saw him from that bluff over there, above the wash where Livy was killed. That's where I found these. - Roy... - Found the leads down in the wash. Maybe you could match some of those up with the lead in that body down there. Roy, you know you shouldn't... You shouldn't have moved these. Hell, you shouldn't even be up here. This is my land, Randall. Well, somebody's got to do your job for you. Check 'em out. They're marked. Shooter must do his own reloads. Did you get a maker on the vehicle? No. Some kind of a four by four. Green. Not many guys around who can make that shot. Yeah, well, there's plenty of people pretty angry about what happened to Livy, Roy. Well, those people got no more business bein' on my land than the damn Mexicans. Randall... I want to talk to Ramirez. You know I can't allow that. You're officially a civilian. Besides, you're the spouse of the victim, and that man is the prime suspect. - How's it gonna look... - I spent over 25 years sittin' in the same chair you park your butt in now, the chair I put you in. I know better than anybody that there's a lot of things you can't do as sheriff, but lettin' me talk to Ramirez ain't one of 'em. I have to... You got five minutes. Jesus, Roy. Yeah. It figures. No. - Carro? - Si. No. Oh, hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. That's okay. We've just been here a few minutes. - I'm Marily. - Hi. How do you like the front of the house? - And the neighborhood? - It's good. - Oh, good. - Good. I have the code to the garage, and I can open the front door and let myself in that way, and then I can let you in. Ah, there it is. Oh-oh, my... Sean! Sean! Sean Louis Pat! What? Your dad wants to see you in the garage! Why? Why? - Why? - But he said right now. Those were out on the ground off the South Ridge of Roy McNary's land. And my .30-06 reloads. I haven't been out there huntin', son. Besides, I always pick up my empties. I even make a mark on 'em with a sharpie, just so I can tell which ones are mine. Those are mine. Any idea how they got out there, son? What the hell were you thinking? Was this your stupid idea? Don't you turn your back on me! Let me talk. Let me talk to him. Well, the boys are tellin' different stories. Two of 'em are sayin' that they were shooting at the Mexicans... 'cause they were beating on Livy and tryin' to steal her horse. You know damned well that's not what happened. Do I? I mean, you thought those Mexicans were beatin' on Livy too. I sat here and listened to you tell me when you pulled up, that Mexican was trying to steal Livy's horse. - Randall... - That's what you said. What... what do we got here really? Roy, I mean... so now we know that the boys were shooting at the Mexicans. Livy didn't die of a gunshot wound, Roy. That's a fact. He's my son, for God's sake. Livy was my wife. Who was the shooter? Well, the boys are tellin' different stories, and they're... - all trying to back each other... - Randall. Who was the shooter? Sean. The shooter was Sean. - Flora, can it wait? - Just thought both you sheriffs... might want to know that a lady called over here just now and said she found a bunch of illegals hiding out in a garage in Phoenix. She said one of the illegals asked her to call over here for her. She said the woman is Miguel Ramirez's wife. Melina Ramirez? Si? Flora? Jesus. I'll call you back in a minute. - Roy! Roy, you can't take her in there. - Well, Flora and I just came by. - We, uh, both have to pee. - Oh, stop! You can't take her in there! No, no, don't. Miss Flora, she can't be in there. You can't go in there. Where are the boys at? Where's Sean? Anybody but Ramirez been charged yet? You know those boys aren't flight risk. Now, they've been released to their parents recognizance. Well, that's a dumb idea since it was on your and their parents recognizance... that the boys are out there poppin' off rounds at people in the first place. - No, you tell them... - Did you talk to the D.A. yet? You told him what's goin' on here? You told him about your boy's involvement? Huh? No, no, no... You go ahead and you call him, and you tell him how you tampered with the damned evidence! - Hello, Seor. - Hola. Thank you for, uh, bringing mija my house. Gracias. Son-in-law. Oh, si. Bueno. - Evening. - Good evening. - Citizenship? - American. - Do you have some I.D.? - I do. - Roy? - Edward. Hi, Flora. How are you? Oh, good to see you, Edward. Hey, Roy, listen. I was really sorry to hear about Livy. - What are you doing in Mexico? - Droppin' off a friend. - Okay. - Okay. Well, it was good to see you both. Same here. You can't walk in here and tell me that Ramirez is without blame. I mean, none of this would have happened if it hadn't been for those goddamn Mexicans - walkin' across your land. - None of this would have happened... if you'd changed the combination on your goddamn gun locker. Okay, but you got to do one thing for me. Those boys got to pay for what they did, Randall. Sean does too. I know that, and I know he does, and he's gonna have to live with it... - for the rest of his life. - So do I. All I'm asking you... is that you say something on his behalf at the deposition. I'm asking you as a father, and as a friend. It was an accident. Randall... The only way I will do that is if he tells the truth about what happened out there. He will. You know, being a dumbass is no excuse. I know that. All right. Yours? Mine and my wife's. - Horse man. - Oh, si. Shadow. Yeah. Livy loved her pony. Come on, Philly! Advance. - Right. - Okay. Okay. Bueno. Yeah, so you better ndale, Seor. Good. Si. Okay. Adios.
