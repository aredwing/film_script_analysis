Why do you bring my mother into this? ls it because l'm keeping quiet? Every day he does it! He's proud because of money! He always does it on seeing girls. You've developed a big body, can't you do anything with him? He's from Gold phase, very dangerous man.- Get lost! Look! He's coming back! Leave him! Not like that, brother!

A dawn that caressed the wishes... That moment my heart said get up... A screen of chill cool breeze and a ray of breaking dawn behind it... lt is making everyone to get up and come fast... When breaking dawn waits... The world will sing like a nightingale... You fatso! You fatty! - Come on guys! Got too much offlab! The entire world joins to celebrate fun mischievously...

Nagaraj was out ofthe world. What a lady! What a face! Excellent tea! What a perfume she uses! Even her slippers are great! - Who beat you? That guy! - That guy? Catch them! - Stop...stop... Catch them! Where are you running away? Look, neither we abused nor beat him. lt was his bad behaviour and Maya madam slapped her. Did you beat him or not? - No! Who are you to take him anyway? Are you police? ls she a chaste woman? You... Rakesh, tell him to behave properly. - Why should l? Wait! He made a mistake and got beaten up, that's it. lf it happens again, it won't be nice, tell him. What's his mistake? Aren't you ogling at her? Don't you desire her? ls it wrong if he ogles her? That's our area and our girl and our wish. Will you keep quiet ifwe pass comments on girls in your phase? Has come to talk! Street dogs are not allowed in the Gold phase. Mind your language, Rakesh. Why should we respect you? How dare you comment on our girls! Come on, dare do it! l'll rip your apart, rascal! You do it first and then l'll show what l would do. You want me to do? - lfyou've guts, do it. Come on do it. - l'll do and show. Hey girl! Would you like to come to tuition? l'll teach you private lessons. Bloody idiot! l'll beat you with slippers! Come!- l told you to stay away from my sister. How dare you beat him! How dare you beat Seenu! Hey guys! Stop, don't fight. Look, he's after Paru! Come on, say it again! Move! - Suresh, bash him.

Brother... Tell Seenu to come to the lake immediately.- Okay.- Fast! Go away from here quickly...quickly! Run! lsn't that good? - That one, right? Where is he? - Who? Who is he? - Who? Are you playing drama? What are you guys? What's your life? What's it? - Your life isn't worth a car! Do you wish for my sister? - What happened? Tell him! l think they've gone that side, come. Leave them! Seenu, come! How strange! Gold phase dogs are in our streets! What's this? - What did you say now? Stop... Why are you taking your anger on me? l'll not spare you! Come, Rakesh. Take it easy! What's this? ls it necessary to comment? They're angry and you're adding oil to fire. No problem. May be mother told me to control anger for this. For the one word dog, l've become an enemy to Rakesh. l'm seeing you hurt every day, are you having fights? Have this! Aunty! Uncle! - What? You brought her home without any intimation. What are you planning to do now? Tell me. l was dreaming you'd pass lAS, were you doing this? You could've at least given a hint to me. At least after you pass or on your return talk to them. They'll not agree, father. They'll force marriage on her. At least made a try! Our property isn't worth their luxury car! Who the girl is anyway? lsn't this his house? - Yes. Suddenly, B-phase and my house became very famous. lt's a record in 20 years that a girl from there has come here. My uncle is using his intelligence to make this marriage happen. Bring the girl. What happened? ls it true? Tell me. How could she fall for Ashok? What could be the reason? He's average and no style or smartness! May be because he's well educated! Would anyone fall for education? What's this? Come out l say...come out... Come out! Sony, come home! Sit in the car. What's this dear? Let's go home. l came here on my wish and will with Ashok. What is your wish? Wait, guys! Shameless! Couldn't you find anyone else? These B-phase dogs... Won't you think about our family? What's our status? Rakesh, it's my personal matter, get out from here. Go out and shout! - Personal matter? Leave me. - Wait! You're my sister! First come home! Let's go home and discuss. Leave me. Wait a minute. - Sony, come! Sony, come out! Ashok, go inside with her. - You both go inside. Come dear. How dare you trap my sister! l'll not spare anyone ofyou! Go man! - Bring her, guys! He's just a rabble rouser! Take it easy! That lake is the only link you've with the B-phase. The problems are because ofthat. So, as you say... This lake is the problem we've with B-phase people. They're able to reach us because ofthis lake. lfyou say yes, a wall would come around this lake, and the lake would become ours! You take care ofthe money, l'll take of Govt. and permissions. l guaranty not even an insect would dare come in from B-phase. Just say yes, sir. Though everyone was against it, though entire Gold phase boycotted it, my uncle arranged the marriage in our house! Everyone was busy and chaos all the way! But amidst all this, Nagaraj tried to get closer to Maya madam. You must do me a small favour, madam. There's a marriage in Seenu's house. The man who eloped with Gold phase girl. Our girls shouldn't look any less in marriage, right? So, you make them look chic! Lakshmi, come quickly. Come l say! l don't want this, l want ajob. l'll find one for you later. What do you think it is? Marriage! We mustn't look ordinary, right? Come. - Okay. lt'll take time, Nagaraj. - No problem, l'll wait. Did you go to China? l see photos of China. Who is he? l see him in all the photos. Friend? Husband? Chinese? How could madam find a Chinese? Couldn't she get anyone in lndia? - Don't feel too much! Girls don't bother about all that! Chinese or Pakistani, nothing matters to them! Do you know what love is? lt's very nice! lsn't she beautiful? She's your sister-in-law! Okay, congrats! Greetings! Chinni, come. Aunty! Seenu! You're grown up! Didn't your mother come? - No, she didn't come, aunt. l wasn't in town, why not visit us sometime? For lunch! Shall we invite them tomorrow? Come...tomorrow or day after... When you're free! Why aren't you wearing anyjewels? Didn't your mother buy anything for you? l'll tell her. Mother! Don't you get peace unless you pass some comment? Shut up! Why are you taking so much interest? Maintain distance from them. lt's wrong. - Come. Why don't you wear the jewels mother gave you? l don't like it. Okay. Return that Rs.20 to her. What?- Call when you've dinner, l'll join you. Wait for me. Okay? Mother is a big bore, always harks about status and nonsense. l'm finished if l get caught with her. Bye.- That Rs.20! What? Your Rs.20... ls it necessary now? l don't want, l'll not take it. Do l look like a money lender? l don't want it. Buy me something...a chocolate! Wait for me! Come, she's like that! Have you seen this flower? Now, it's gone inside. Do you want diamonds? A beauty this world hasn't seen yet... Love is in air when she's around... Now, it's good. How are my parents? Your father isn't coming out. Rakesh is enraged. He warned me not to go, l said l'll wear black to protest. Nobody is with me, l'm sad, Paru. At least you stay with me for some time, please have something. l'll tell some to look after you. She's coming here! Your magic was cool! - Did you see it? Shall we? - Me? Would you like to give me company? - Company? lsn't he super? Would you like to taste pappu? How about sambar? Brinjal? Pappu...sambar... Desert is there! Are you on diet? Miss lndia prelims are scheduled next month. Look at her blouse! There's nothing! Pappu is very tasty! What's your name? Abhi? Are you Abhi? Was it you who gave chocolate to Suresh, and said l'll get close to you in 3 months? l didn't mean like that. l said you'll go away from him in 2 months and 10 days. How do you say it? Where you are and where he is! You're very beautiful! One photo please. Reddy, take the plate. - Yes, brother. Come closer. You're so small, why did you take on him? ls it necessary? Suresh will not spare you. Leave it, Paru. Gold phase people need a reason to fight, that's all. l'm also from Gold phase, right? By the way if Sony marries Ashok, is it our mistake? Recently for our Chow-Chow... We came to gold phase searching for a girl friend to him. Rakesh then said B-phase dogs mustn't enter Gold phase. Only humans have class difference, would dogs mind it? You tell me. l don't know who is wrong. but my people are waiting for an opportunity to bump you off. l admire your confidence! Your ruffled my hair! Thank you very much. Don't pinch my cheeks! Why would l pinch your cheek? Buddy...ln 10 years, she never saw anyone. She didn't even smile at! Never talked a word. Give a five! Go, ask her number. - Number? Did you take her number? - No. Take it from her. lfyou're with them, it'll protect us, go. Paru, you sit inside. l'll give him the number. What did you say now? Do you want her cell phone number? Do you want it? - What's this? l promise...l'll not rest till l break your bones. Do you want her number? - Yes, l do.- Take it. Tell me. Give me the phone. Take it. That is Paru's maid servant's number, call her. Romance with her. That is your level! Just one month and 10 days! - What did you say? Have chocolate! What did you say? - Come on, leave it. Paru is waiting, come. What happened? - Just gave him a chocolate. What's this? - Why trouble in marriage? You asked for some job, right? That girl? Need a receptionist in our club house. Tell her to come. You're notjoking, are you? - Why would l joke with you? Call her. Call her! They need a receptionist, are you interested?- Where? ln Gold phase. Ajayjust told me about it. Gold phase...is it okay? l too thought about it, no problem, it's just ajob. You'll get money. Come. Let's meet in office tomorrow. Bring her to office tomorrow. - Okay lsn't it confirmed? - Confirmed. Okay. Will you give chocolates to them only not to me? l'll give you also, Chinni. How dare you give chocolate to Suresh! Seenu, you need to vacate the room immediately. New couple would stay here. Sathya and Chinni, you adjust in Harini's room. Seenu, you shift to Ashok's study room in the outhouse.- Okay, aunt. Please help them to shift. l'll be back in a minute. Gift to friend's brother? That too Rs.2000! Look at our status! You don't earn a rupee! Why are you after money? l'll return it, stop it now. Leave him, you come. What's this? l saved it from marriage, l love it. Why do you get so angry? Shut up! l'm working and he's eating it away. lf not he, who else would eat? Would he be always like this? He'll earn when his time comes. Shut up! Your pamper has spoilt him. Eat! Does he know anything about life? Watch out, he'll ruin himself. Why would he? Some day my son will come good in life. We're living, right? Shouldn't we help each other? Do you believe it? You thought so and helped me get a job. Take it easy. Okay, bye. ls this betel leaf? l'll get you Ram Pyari, it'll be out ofthis world! l tripped and fell into heaven! Ashok room means uncle's out house? l mean Padhu's house. What's there in those smiling eyes? What's there on the tip ofthose lips? What's there to pull in those beautiful curves? What's there to get attracted in these girls? Don't know what would happen on seeing so much beauty... Would my youth heed the warnings of my soul... There's a possibility of something wrong happening... lf l'm after you... Father, Paru's car! Paru, yourAbhi! Marriage...pappu...sambar... The sight that bites heart is beautiful... Mock anger is beautiful... Words that express the heart is beautiful... Everything is beautiful... A beauty this world hasn't seen yet... Love is in air when she's around... Lightning body is beautiful... Walking gait is beautiful... Waist is beautiful... Words spoken are beautiful... Aren't Women beautiful? Won't our hearts become theirs? This is what you call rage! Rakesh's anger crossed me, my family and showed it on B-phase. Before we could understand, we had power and water cuts. Gold phase trash and dogs entered our area. But everything turned out to be advantage to us. We came closer to each other. Children started playing happily on roads without TV. Without fridge, colony mothers started social cooking! Mothers moved around water tanks and we went along with them. Don't know why days turned very exciting! Even our dogs got Gold Phase Company. lsn't that Abhi's dog? Why is it coming here? Got them! Call those bloody rogues! Chow-Chow has been trapped by Gold phase guys.- Where? Abhi, run...run... Catch them! - Leave me! Do you need these boys? Do you want Paru's number? She's my sister! - How would l know? Will you conduct my sister's marriage? Enough, come. How dare you cross our paths! Let's go. Abhi just called, Gold phase people are here. Gold phase? Bloody! Mother...mother... l know her, Gold phase Paru. Miss lndia, right? Not yet aunty. l'm trying for it. l'll show her my room, mother. - Okay. lt wasn't eating anything for two days, l thought it was for Chow-Chow. Are you here for that, Paru? To see you also. l'm fine. They shouldn't have done that. lt was all because ofTinkle, right? l'm feeling guilty. lt's not yourfault. Do you read Devadas? To know everything about Paru. l mean Devadas' Paru! Can you do me a small help? You do magic, right? lfyou teach me few tricks... Me? Judges will get excited. Will you please give me your cell number? - My number? l'll show another magic trick. - Not now! Buddy, you've planted a bomb in Paru's heart. What are you doing? What did you do? l think l've used too much of material. Why did Paru go to his house? Why do you get so much excited? That's theirworld! We must enter theirworld. We must show them the taste of money! We must remove the smile of happiness from their lives. We must give different background music to them. We're celebrating Gold phase fifth anniversary, we're inviting few special people only, you and sir must make it. We'll see! lf possible, we'll make it. Bring Padhu with you. - Yeah, sure. lfwe come, she'll also come. You can bring Seenu too. lt seems they both are engaged! Going to office? No, l'll go. Why are you smiling at me? Don't you've any work? l'll beat you with slippers. l'm your class mate. l sit in the last bench. Where's Chinni? - Where did she go? Not seen around. She's a good cook, she prepared everything. What happened? Chinni is missing. - Missing? Missing? Return my box. lf not l'll kill you. Why do you want my box? Return it... Chinni is missing, sir. Father-in-law, Chinni is missing, we've to search for her. Stop...stop... Did you see Chinni? lnform us ifyou see her. Give the bike. - Okay. l'll go with Sathya. Seenu, Chinni is here! What happened, Chinni? - Are you here? What happened? Why is she wounded? How did you get hurt, Chinni? What happened, Chinni? We got worried, l almost died! Children are getting kidnapped at drop of hat. Never do that again. Pamper her more! Has no respect or good behaviour. That sofa costs a lakh, she ruined it for nothing. Keep quiet. - Why should l? Forget about sofa, why to run away? Bad behaviour, fighting at this age? ls this the way to raise children? l must accuse your mother. Look at her! How she's staring at me! Didn't even say sorry to me. Chinni, say sorry to aunty. Sorry aunty. - Will you run away in anger? What would l tell your mother? She said you're here to study, ifyou act like this l can't take it. Call your mother, Seenu. l'll talk to her. Sister, please don't cry. So many people are sad because of her and yet not a tear in her eyes. l feel like crying but mother said not to cry, aunt. A boy took my pencil box and ran away. lt has mother's photo, that's why l beat him. Did you hear that? - Enough dear. Little girl, she did it unwittingly. You please go now. Come. - Come. Padhu, come home. What have l done to you? Am l not caring you like my own? You keep quiet, she's just a little girl.- No... She's a little girl, Sathya too... Just now got a call from her college. lf she doesn't improve in the next test, she'll be out of star batch. l didn't want to tell this before everyone. Keep on crying. - Let's go. You're the eldest, you must take care ofthem. Don't tell anything to mother. l'll improve in next test. Aunt scolded me unnecessarily. l thought she's good aunt but she scolded me. No dear, aunt is very good lady. She said in anger. She was afraid of missing you. That's all. l don't want to stay here. Let's go back to mother. lt's very difficult here. Shall we go back to mother? - Okay, let's go. Let's go. - No. l had promised mother to stay for a year. Stop! Everyone must say Chinni is very good girl. You mustn't cry for a year. Okay? Okay? Chinni will never cry! Chocolate for you! Take chocolate. You like it, right? What's happening? Gold phase people are occupying our lake. Let's go. - We must stop them. Time passed away quickly. B-phase which could never come together on anything, but it stood as one against the occupation ofthe lake. My lawyer uncle got a stay order immediately from the court. l've talked fewer times with mother getting involved in colony matters. Actually, we're unable to get mother on phone. Padhu lost her freedom totally. Aunt has become a detective. Abhi was on top in the company of Paru. Lakshmi too got adjusted well to the life in Gold phase. We couldn't adjust about that. Nagaraj was too much! Then came Vinayaka Jayanthi! Seenu, come here. - What? Gold phase people have installed a 10 feet Ganesh! ls it? - We must install 12 feet one!- Okay. Uncle, donation for Ganesh festival! Donation madam. - What? Just Rs.10! Just a paltry Rs.10 only! - That's enough, go! You go in! Come on guys! - Go! Hail Lord Ganesh! Yours is 10 feet and ours is 12 feet tall! Look at our taller Ganesh! Rakesh, their Ganesh is taller than ours.- Yes. You come! Look there! Break it! Come on boys, hold it! Give that to me! Watch now! Look! Silver Ganesh! Weighs one kilogram! Come! - What are you doing? Come on boys! Hey boys! God... That is your level! That is! That is your level! We were proud of having but didn't expect Gold phase people would put us to shame like this. We gave a good thought about the reasons for that. Nagaraj says money, l said we don't have self confidence. We mustn't leave it, we must compete with them in everything. Participate in beauty contests too! - Beauty contests? Beauty contest? - What's beauty contest? Why not? What do we lack? Aren't there girls here? One more thing, we must do it anyway! Nobody from B-phase must work in Gold phase. That would be best! What? Beauty contest? Have you gone mad? No way! Then, l'll never talk to you. - Are you threatening me? l don't care ifyou don't talk. Then, l'll stop eating. father, tell her. - You keep quiet. What's your problem? lfyou appear on TV in skimpy dresses, nobody would marry you in future. Then, l'll never marry! You're arranging a meeting the bride program, right? Call them, l'll show you. Call them! lf l agree to beauty contest, is it okay to meet the prospective groom? l'll show you! Slowly! Why are you rushing? For you! - For me? Thank you very much, Padhu! Motherwanted to get it for long time but... l know it. Mother is searching grooms for me, so says mother. Are you mad? You like her, right? You're a natural suitor to her! Why are you still hesitating? lfyou're silent and she says okay to that lAS! You'd be left alone! He's right. Please listen to me. Before the groom comes to see her, meet her and say l love you, everything will be set! Okay?- Don't shy off! Ask her! - That's all! Can you ask Paru? - Me? Look at him! l'll come till there. - No please. lnvite her to some film! Emraan Hashmi's film is the best. But no film is on show. So what? Why not ask her once? Would she come or not or refuse you? You can know it by face reaction. What's the matter? - Nothing! Then, tell me what is she thinking by seeing her face? Face? l think she's rushing to toilet. Look, how she's rushing! Be on yourjob. You'll buy a gift, right? What will you buy? That's all! Shall we go out for lunch tomorrow? l'll make a call. Come here! You're beautiful, Padhu! You're coming for lunch, right? You...l'm eagerly waiting for your invitation. Today is her birthday too! Let's do it like that. lt seems they're coming today! l told them it's your birthday. With Baba's blessings everything is going fine. Why blessings? Who is coming? Grooms' people are coming to see you. No way, mother. lmpossible! l've plans! Today is my birthday and my wish! What are your plans? lt would be something with friends. Anyway you need to prepare for such things. l need to prepare my body to sit before some man like a sheep! Tell them it's not possible. When are you going out with friends? - Lunch at 1 pm! Go to beauty parlour at 10, and go on for lunch. Are you also coming with me? No, l'll drop and pick you up! Mother! Send this message. Send it to Radha! Give it to me. Take it. Meeting prospective groom, getting ready. Why are you torturing me like this, mom? l'm your only daughter! Why do you hate me so much? What happened? What did l do? Did you meet Padhu? What is she saying? No, l didn't. She didn't turn up. Seenu, its Padhu! Let's go! Why? Please ask Seenu to answer my phone call. l've been trying since morning. l'll give you a treat! l'll tell him! lt seems she said sorry so many times, why you still so haughty? Shall we go to watch evening show tomorrow? May be she doesn't know your plan. What's your problem? Why don't you talk to her? She has promised to give me a treat also. Prospective groom has come! - That's the problem! l'm not the right choice for Padhu! Aunty will find a good groom for her. - Some lAS officer! That's better for her. - Please tell him, Nagaraj! lfyou think like that what an uneducated man like me would think? lfyou like, you've to fight! - That's better! Will you sit here and cringe? Hey, sister-in-law! Brother! Sister-in-law! l'll come back! Let's discuss it again, don't worry. Okay? One minute! How beautiful you're like Sridevi! ls it your birthday? Ajay is giving a party, he's forcing me to attend. You too come with me , please. - Let's go! Will you come like this? - lsn't it good? You're exceptional and sexy too! - What? May be people would find it difficult there. Shall we go? - Okay. Brother, Emraan Hashmi! He's calling you! Let's sit there! Sit here, don't worry. lt's routine here! Would you like to have something? Will you please give somejuice? l don't know to dance. What are you doing here? - Paru invited me! What man? Move out! What a life, right? Do you love him? l mean Ajay... No, nothing like that. He offered me ajob and he's a good man, that's all. That's all! Just a small doubt! Who is it? Bloody spoiler! What is he saying? See! - Tell me. See it yourself. Okay! Shall we go? For you! - Sit here. Chinni, l've a small problem. - What? l've lost my honour! Don't tell anyone. l couldn't read a message in a cell phone. lt's in English, right? - Don't you know alphabets too? You must help me. You're learning English, right? Will you teach me? l'll teach you. - will you? Open the door! Come up, l want to talk to you. Don't act smart! l'm telling you! Come! lfyou leave, l'll raise an alarm. What's it? Tell me! lt wasn't my fault, l didn't know about it till morning. l wanted to tell after meeting you. You got angry. Mother sent that message. ls it? Okay. How is it? Mother bought diamond studs. That's why l didn't wear it morning. How do l look? You're good. But diamonds would suit well for your status. Where's my chocolate? Nagaraj told me, it seems you brought it. No. - ls it downstairs? No, l ate it. - Ate it? Did you buy for my birthday and ate it?- Why? l wasn't interested to give, so l ate it. You're shameless! You're taking revenge with some ulterior motive, right? Do you know how much l tried since morning to meet you? Do you know how many restrictions l have! Can't you understand it? l took the risk and came to meet at midnight wearing these rings. You've no courtesy too! But still ate the chocolate. Go away! How is he? What? He came, right? He saw you, right? Swinging here and there... Stirring emotions... Creating confusion... What has happened to my heart? Jumping with joy... rambling delightfully... Chasing thoughts... What has happened to my heart? lt started because ofyou... lt's no more in my control... O love! You're taking my life... Till l think about you... What happened? You're with me always... Till l become like you... For you! - What's that? l don't want. No! Then, l too don't want it. What? Go away! You're the chill that can give cold to moon... You're the heat that can make sun sweat... You're the lightning that can turn clouds... You're a woman who can fill the time with dreams... lf silence is your language, smile is a Haiku... lt is forcing me to read the epic poem in your eyes... Take it. - Keep it. lt looks ordinary ifyou come... When l fathom the depth l feel it is magical... You burn me like fire when away... Cool like snow when near me... Even a flower sees the beauty after it blossoms... lfyou bloom, entire lifespan would turn happy... ls it ticket? You're great, buddy! - Show me. Shall we also go with him? - Yes, buddy. l can talk to Lakshmi for long time. - ln flight? My friend has a tempo, let's travel in it. l'll ask him. lt'll be fun! Tempo? l'll alsojoin you then. Mad boy! You must be with Paru! Only then they'll feel the heat! Okay? - Okay. ls Lakshmi coming? She'll come if Sathya toojoins us. Will you please ask Sathya? - Sathya? l don't think so. Exams are nearing, she must study. Would you like to come to Vizag? l mean some beauty contest. We're all going. - Vizag? Yes, its holidays, please join us. lfyou come, Lakshmi too would come. Okay, l'll come. - You're coming, right? Great! Beauty contest date has been announced, it's in Vizag. We already know that. We're travlling by tempo, would you like to join us, Padhu? Take it easy, how can she come with us in tempo? he'll come in a flight with her mother. lt seems beach in Vizag is very beautiful, will you take me there? Hey Padhu! Look there! - What? Stop...stop... Missed the flight! What about aunt? - They didn't miss it. Let's play songs game. Please allow me to go. Are you scared, Paru? Anyway they're praying Lord Venkateshwara, let's pray to Jesus or Allah! Without even seeing her marriage... Thank God, at least she escaped! She didn't make it with us. My mother died when l was very young. Where are you? l'm also like you... l never expected an end like this. Please don't cry, Paru. l feel sad to see you cry. Let anything happen to our plane orwe die, l'll ensure nothing would happen! l promise! Don't get tensed! ls pilot there? are you going to die? l didn't mean like that. l wanted to become Miss lndia, my mother's last wish. l didn't see Swiss! l wanted to start a company.- ls it? l wanted to have a lot of children. l was lone child! That Suresh! - He? Look, how he got sacred and ran away! l don't know! l wanted to study PG in America. l wanted to make an electric car for my dad. l don't have any other wishes than these. How fair you're like milk! Now l've a fulfilled a wish! l don't mind dying now! l don't fear anymore. Why are you sitting here? Sit here. - Go away! What is Abhi doing on TV? How do you feel now? What? - l pray God it happens again and again! There's no doubt passengers lost balance by this forced landing. This is Rambabu with cameraman Ganga... lndeed! Abhi is here! How do you do? - l'm fine. Did you get hurt? - No. l've highlight news, l'll tell you.- Sit here... We thought plane would crash. - ls it? They said emergency landing. lt was chaos and confusion. We thought we would die. Suresh almost wetted his pant and ran away! The seat next to Paru was empty and l occupied it. Did you sit next to her? - Sat next to her? e talked about life! She asked about my interests. What did you tell her? l asked if l could touch her. She said okay. - Did you touch her? Where? l touched her. - Touched her? Her hand! - Hand? Where else can he touch? Then, suddenly the plane zoomed down! - ls it? When l saw she was on my shoulder. l was confused. Lights went off and people were shouting! Then, l looked into her eyes. She too looked into my eyes. - What are you saying? Then...suddenly she kissed me! - Kiss? Kissed you? lsn't it? Did Gold phase Paru kiss you? Let's go! Seenu, go! lt's my magic trick! Watch out! My face will appear! lt happened because ofyou. - l agree it's my mistake. Actually l'm interested in this, just to be with you all, how can l wear such skimpy dresses before everyone? l don't mind it with you. Seenu! Let's marry! What? Bloody! You almost killed me! You said it without saying! Why do you do like this? Always it's me first! Right? Right? Street dogs! lfwe throw biscuits they come to eat it. lfwe give tem jobs, they'll toil for us. No Paru, we mustn't love them, we mustjust use them. That too, a girl like you! You were number in the prelims. Your status is different from his status. He's not even worth the dust offyour feet. What's this, Paru? - Stop...stop... Tell him to stop! Get lost! Don't know what it is... Delicately it's pulling me towards it.. With a thin thread invisible to eyes... Don't know what is... lt is pushing me towards it... With lips made offlowers and honey... Why my heart is getting tickled? What could be the reason for so many wonders? Come flying, O butterfly... Flowers are in hurry with the burden of honey... Without making any noise and silently... Silently without making any noise, don't go hiding, O raindrop... The little plant is waiting on the ground... Even a moment near her is... Walking is a celebration... every moment is fun and folic... Life is a festival... and ever burning lamps... Why do wee need silvery moonlight or bright sunshine? Has youth suddenly waked up in heart? Clouds...directions...sky...stars... they weren't like this yesterday... Eyes have brightened with newly filled light... What is this shiver in my heart? Who is mesmerizing me? Who is making me absent minded? Who has moved my heart? With warm mischief... You still consider me more important than him in your life, right? Father! Nobody is more important to me than you. Okay? lf it is love... But it's not love, right? Okay? What are the chances? - Little tough situation. They offer prayers to trees. So B-phase argument is no individual rights on religious grounds. Religious sentiment, right sir? lt's difficult. lfwe kill the tree. Will you please come up? - Coming! What is this? A small arrangement because nobody is at home. Sit here. Here? Come. For you! A sari! - Why? Just like that, take it. l've decided to settle in life. l've seen a lot of life! l've seen many girls. l did business. Finally, don't know why but l like you! lfyou say okay, l'll talk to my father and marry you. Take it as my proposal. No, l don't like it. What did you say? Don't you like me? Are you saying no to me? l'm Nagaraj! Are you saying no to me? Do you know how many girls in Gold phase are after me? Do you know my connections? You're not here for 2 months and so proud! Didn't l get you a job? Didn't l help you? Are you refusing because you're from Andhra and l'm Telengana.- No! What's it then? l'm like Ravi Teja offilm 'ldiot'. Try to understand. lfyou're like Ravi Teja of idiot, l can spend Rs.50 to watch the film. But we don't marry him, right? Again formal? l'll talk to you like that only. lf l'm not formal, you're getting feelings. Do you love someone else? lf it is Ajay, forget it. He's very dangerous man, a crook to the core. My father is a security guard, l want to come up in life. My aim is to do engineering. You don't have any ambition. You don't have any education. We both are different. l too would change, would l remain like this? l'll also develop! May be you're not in good mood, take your own time and tell me. Go. Nothing like that. l've decided. Bloody! Have you decided? No chance? You can go now! You've told me, right? What? ln the anger of rejecting your love... Please don't harm me. We're poor people, please leave me. Brother! Madam has started the dance. l've informed Seenu and Abhi also! ls it time to tell? You told me to inform, right brother? - That's why l informed you. Let's go. You were right, would l cry for a girl here? Come. Let's go to see madam. l'm not in good mood. Yes, l've also gone blank. What about you? No phone calls for 2 days, everything is cut off. l don't know what is happening? They've increased the security too in Gold phase. But l must meet her once! l don't know what the problem is! Shall we go tonight? - Cool! Listen to me, don't meet her. l'm sure she'll say no. But l'll know only if l meet her, right? No need! l've got the answer. That's enough! Life is beautiful only if you've money.- Not like that. lfyou've heart, life is beautiful. Okay, come. We've to meet Paru. ls it her house? - That side only. That house, right? - Yes, that one!- Let's go. There she is! Come fast! Hold it. - Get up! Be careful! Why? lt's so dangerous! lf my father sees, he'll kill you. We almost died, Paru. lf not then, now! l don't fear anymore. l thought your father forced you like in films... Just came to save you. l mean like a hero! This is not a film. - Don't you like me then? Don't know. We kissed each other. B-phase people marry ifthey kiss each other. ln my area too! Dream? Shall we kiss again? To spend like with you... To think about it or not is confusing. l'm scared. Scared? Unlike in past. What should l do to make your fearvanish? What do you want me to do? Shall we marry? l told you'd be left alone. Come. Come, just one more clarification. Come fast! Lift me once more please. - Get up! Tell me one thing... tell me the truth, please. This isn't by any chance a scheme by Gold phase people, right? ls everything a scheme? He's falling down, hold him! l told you, she slapped, right? - Slapped? lfyou've money, life is beautiful!

Brother! Tears! Brother is crying! Why is he crying? Why all this? - Foryou! Today is her birthday, l presented that sari. ls that why she looked beautiful in sari? She takes the gifts but behaves proudly. Forget it, brother! Come and wish her! lt's part of life! Come brother...come... Come...come... Brother! Bye. Why again? Who are you? - l came forvehicle. This is your birthday special gift. l'll wear it myself. No problem, l'll wear it myself. What happened? - Leave me. Try to understand me. Leave me...leave me. Try to understand me. Lakshmi, stop! Don't tell my father, please. Father can't take it. Do you've to tell me? Don't l know that? l'm not educated but l do have common sense. What do you think ofyourself? He's educated, right? That's his education! l don't want that education! lfyou become like that as an engineer, l don't want you too. Got it? Don't cry, please. lt's over, forget it. Blood! Tell me one thing clearly, l'll break the bones ofAjay, is it okay to you? Tell me. lfyou go to hospital and romance him, l can't take it. l'll be hurt. That's why l didn't beat him. Tell me, is it okay? lt's okay to me. He says l want you, poor girls are cheap to him. Beat him! Bash him! lt seems they're beating our boy! Finish the shave, please! How dare you come to my office and beat me! You're finished! Leave him! Police are coming! - Move... Move.. - Leave it. lfwe weren't there... l'll take care of it, you go.

What did you do man? When would rain come, how Maya madam would dance, we had thought only about how to see it, Maya madam appeared like an angel that day! Rakesh, please listen to me. A compromise would be good for everyone. Raju, come here. What's this? How did it happen? Didn't Sathya come with you? She left saying it's your birthday party! No, l didn't meet her after morning. May be she went to some friend's house. Why did she lie to me then? Just a minute. Please check in home if Sathya is there or not. Okay, l'll check. - l'm little tensed. Meet me in my room. l'm coming. l'll meet you later, be careful. Nagaraj, you're bleeding. - Leave it, let's go home. She's home. Wait! Why did she lie to me? What's the necessity? Don't shout at her, let's ask her patiently. No, it never happened before. Leave it. - She never lied to me. Smile please! l said smile! Aunty! How dare! Where did you learn this from? Was it from your mother? ls this the way to raise children? lt was my mistake to allow you into this house. Why are you shouting at midnight? What ever it is, let's discuss tomorrow.- He... We'll lose our honour, you go inside. Seenu, you go. Come. - Go away! What? Shall we go to watch a film? No way! l've to bunk class, you know that. You must take their responsibility and take care ofthem. Father too wanted you to become a doctor. Stay away from girls and troubles. Are you feeling sad? You're a hero, right? l said that day that l'll ruin you. Your love, your career, your sister! Everything! l'll kill you. - Leave me. Not me, hold your sister. Cry before her and ask why she's doing like this? Only then you'd understand my pain! Go and watch your sister's love story in bus stop. Come! Tell me, who sent you? ls it Rakesh? l'm asking you patiently, answer me.- No need to talk to him. Sathya is coming, accept it before her. lf not l'll kill you. Tell her. Bloody! - Stop...stop... Get lost! Why are you beating him? Why did you take my phone? Are you into detective work? ls it hooliganism? Will you kill? Even after seeing this, you're asking about him, right? l'm a detective and a goon! You're ruining yourself. You've ruined studies, ifyou go with him life too... Please Sathya, try to understand. He's using you! He's not a right guy! What would you tell mother? How would you face mother? l'll tell mother, l'll face her myself. My studies have no connection with him. l don't want to study medicine. l'll tell her. Have you gone mad? What nonsense you're talking? l can't do it. You come, Sathya. - Are you perfect to tell mother? Then, you feel about me. ls this the way to talk to your brother? Nagaraj, stay out of it, this is our personal matter. You come, Sathya. - Why is she talking like this? Aunt said great things about you. Calm down, she's just a little girl. My sister! How can she take on me for him? l want to go to my place, lt's been many days since l've seen mother. Why now? Finish your exams. Sathya has 3 months of coaching classes. No uncle, l must go. Sathya doesn't want to study medicine, l want to tell her. lt wasn't my mistake in Padhu's matter too, uncle. Aunt will ask again if l come home. l want to see my mother immediately. Okay, l'll also come with you. Let Chinni stay here, let's leave by morning. Okay uncle, come quickly. What happened? - what happened? l'm going home. What? Will you also come with me? Sathya will have company. - Okay, l'll come. She's not talking to me. l'll also come with you, Seenu. Let's take my dad's car. Why are we here, uncle? Why have we come to hospital? why did you bring us here? Why don't you say anything, uncle? ls it our mother? Uncle? She's not my mother. Tell me, Seenu. She's not my mother! What's this uncle? What's this? Why is she in a hospital? Nothing will happen to mother. - No problem, calm down. Calm down. She had beautiful long hair! She's not my mother. What happened to my mother, uncle? Mother! - Mother! Will you get a seat? No, she didn't come, mother. ls Chinni crying? No mother, she never cries. She didn't cry even once! She always says about promise given to you. She speaks very good English. She's not biting nails too. She's taking bath on her own. She has become a darling You all are darlings! - Mother! l did injustice to you. - Please mother! Don't say like that, mother. We're here, right? - No, don't stay here. No, mother. - Go away! Study well. l don't want you around this hospital. That's why l didn't tell you anything. Sathya must become a doctor, you must get a good job. How can it be possible ifyou stay here? Are they your friends? - Yes, mother. Very good friends, mother. Mother, you don't worry! You'll get better. God always help good people. Mother, you must make biryani for me. Seenu told me you make very good biryani. You must definitely do it, mother. Mother... - Mother! What happened? - Let her rest! Till now she was brave, now she has stopped the treatment. She thinks its wasteful expenditure. She's worried about not leaving anything for you. You carry on the treatment. We'll take loan or sell our house. But, your mother is worried about spending Rs.10 lakhs already. That's why herwill power has come down. She's not listening to your uncle too. She's not showing any interest in the treatment. Would she get cured if she continues the treatment? lfshe has will power, l'm sure result will be better. l wish to call mother again... Let those innocent childhood days make a come back... Till sky and earth are with us as support... ln the witness of breezing wind and shining stars... l want you, mother... Don't leave me, mother... You're our love, mother... My heart startled seeing you in my dream... When will you come before me like a lullaby? You're the food before we say we're hungry... You'll narrate stories at night like moon... Though we're grown up, we'rejust kids to you.. Show mercy and be with us... lf God has a mother's heart... Won't he give a new life to you? Mother's condition brought dramatic change in us. Our anger, our difficulties, it's not worth anything in life! We realised life itself is a fortune. l realised nothing in this world is important than Sathya and Chinni. Aunt is not well, you've responsibilities, you're right! Why are you punishing me? l was expecting you'd say let's marry! Aren't you ashamed? l can't stay with you. lfyou're gets angry and blabbers some nonsense. My mother will not live! Try to understand me. Why should mother know it? Let's remain silent. Let's wait. l'll stop eating and die. What if Sathya too does the same thing? What if she too has deal like this with Manish? What would happen then? l can't take it. Who gave you permission to take the car? How dare you take it! We're living, right? Shouldn't we help each other? Bloody! ls yours a life? Two days will get me Rs.10000! Who will pay you? What right you've on my money? Stop! why are you beating him? Go, get it. - where will he go? Let me see who will pay for it? Please cool down. - Shut up! Let him in if he brings money. - Leave it, mother. l used your carfor my friend's mother, money can get any car here. - Calm down son. But that is life, we can't buy it, do you understand that? Get lost! Go to your friends! Let me see who will offer you food! Go! l'll go. l'll show you! Notjust a day, if l need notjust my friends but world will come behind me. That is my confidence! - Get lost! Brother is coming for dinner, send a kilogram of chicken. lt's a matter of honour! Send at least a leg piece! Stay in my house. l think he's going with sister-in-law. Cancel the chicken. No please, you too think like my father, right? No matterwherever l may stay! Please don't mind, send at least a leg piece. How come you got up so early, son? l'll get worried ifyou get up so early! What's the matter? ls everything okay? Tell me one thing, mother. - what's that? l've been watching you since childhood, you get up early, you arrange everything, you go to work, when l come back, you're in home, always with a smile, you always think about me, mother. But what do you really need, mother? Tell me. What should l study or how or what can l do to make you happy? No need, stay as you're now, that's enough! You don't like it, right? No problem, you pinch my cheeks, mom. - Be happy, son! Go! That's all, mother! Please say something. Nothing son, go! - Mother, you're my darling! Suddenly we were all awake! Abhi was back into his world! Chinni has become an expert in English! Padhu gave her mother many twists in her inimitable style. Please look up at least once! Nagaraj understood it's not easy to do business like studying. What does he really want? What can he really do? ln such a situation Maya madam reappeared like an angel. You know to drive, right? Come with me. One of my friends is going to Dubai, he has 3 lndicas, he's selling them, would you like to hire it? Are you interested? Money? Not much...about Rs.3 lakhs! l'll try in bank, do you've support? Support? They'd give life for me. Okay then, l'll tell you by evening. You're doing this for me... - Why wouldn't l? You're B-phase goon, right? Buddy! Madam promised help! Cars business! Why did you come, Lakshmi? Go away! lt won't be nice if people see you with me. Why are you hurting me? Did l say anything wrong? Was it really a grave sin? You're nice with everyone, why are you so angry on me? l said sorry, do you want me to fall at your feet? l'm not angry on you, no way! lfyou come near me, l'll get feelings. No need oftrouble, please go away. Take it. You'll get Rs.2 lakhs! Give it in bank. l didn't take breakfast from you. lf l take money from you, l'll die! l said l'll get feelings, try to understand. No problem, let it come. My father saved it for my marriage. No please, you say it's for your marriage. l'll feel bad. Nothing is more important than you. Nojokes please. l'm a useless guy! You know it well! My fatherwon't trust me. - l trust you. You need education but education is not everything. l've realised it. What did you say? - l've realised it. Not that, before that what did you say? You called me informally, right? Has formality left you? - Yes. Only informality works here, every word comes from heart. lt's 100% pure! Take it! What if l lose the money? - You're there, right? Nagaraj found a big hope in life! Likewise l felt we too were in for good times. Sathya and Lakshmi wrote entrance exam very well. As an addition to this excitement, l cracked Google interview! Seenu is here! What happened? - l got it! Who is it? - l'm Dr.Krishnaprasad here. Mother's condition is very serious, please come immediately. Coming, doctor. What? Tell me! What if l introduce Padhu to mother? Aunty...uncle... Why are you here again? Get out! Please tell him. Uncle, one minute. Aunty, give Padhu to me, we'll marry. l've got a good job, aunt. Rs.25000 a month salary. l know you think about our property and caste. l'll take good care of her. Uncle, please tell her. - What would he tell me? You go out! Please tell him! Uncle, mother is sick. - What happened to your mother? Mother is suffering from cancer. Cancer? We don't know what's happening? l'm not here to embarrass you, uncle. l wanted to introduce Padhu to mother. lfyou agree in future, l would've the satisfaction of showing Padhu to my mother. That's all! Come! - Padhu, you're not going anywhere! Mother, leave my hand! lfyou stop me now, l'll die! l'll die! What's this, mother? You look tired! Why did you come, son? - l got a job, mother. Sister has written the entrance exam. She has done it well. What happened to your hair, mother? l've lost it, son! l'm feeling tired. How are you? - Fine, mother. Mother sent this for you. When will you make biryani for me, mother? Mother, she's Padhu! Junior uncle's daughter. How are you parents? - Fine, aunt. You leave now. - Mother... Don't worry! l'll come! l told you not to come to hospital. You leave now. Mother!- Go now! - You've promised! Take care! - l'll come there! Chinni, tell! Chinni, tell about mother. Tell, Chinni! Think about mother and say something. That's it! Why did you do like this, mother? Why did you take a promise from me? Why did you leave me? l can't speak in English, grandpa. l can't say about mother in English! You gave me everything l liked, now you're not with me. l've forgotten what l really liked! l used to win always when you were with me, now l'm losing! l'm drinking milk and eating cabbage too! You always made cakes for my friends. Now l'm going to my friends' homes to have cakes. When l get sacred at nights l used to sleep holding you tightly, now l don't get sacred at all, mother! Who should l tell? Don't you know it? That you shouldn't have left me! l'm a little girl! Why did you punish me harshly? But still you're my best friend. l remembered mother! - Calm down, everything will be fine. Why are you crying dear? You said it wonderfully. Where is mother, brother? Don't cry, Chinni! You said it very well! Where is mother? - Mother... One year is over, right? - Mother promised to come, right? That is...mother... - Where is mother, Abhi? Where's mother, uncle? She's near the lake! - Mother! Mother! Don't know why l feel sad... very sad! This colony has given me a lot of memories and taught me many lessons. Tomorrow l'm leaving, new generation has arrived. Cricket on roads, power cuts, rain, Maya madam! Mother lake and the tree! All would remain as memories! We fell into hard times because ofyou and were in tears. We had fights and got back the lost smiles. lt has brought completeness to our lives. You're my hero! Thanks to you too! l've realised money and happiness have no connection. Even ifwe occupy the lake, we wouldn't still be happy. Tender wishes are becoming ambitions of life... Why should we leave, mother? Can't we stay here only? Yes, mother! Let's stay here. lt's fine here. Please stay here. - Please stay here, mother. ls this your sign? - Yes sir. l know only that, Lakshmi! What happened, Lakshmi? This is bank! - Take it easy! How can you be so happy? Nagaraj is settled. Seenu and Sathya are studying hard. Aren't missing? Aren't you missing me?
