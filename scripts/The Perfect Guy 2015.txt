I'm already late. - Hello? - Leah, it's Tom. You're worried about Wharton. Well, I wasn't until Alan called me at 6:00 a.m. this morning. They don't think we have the votes. Tom, I've got this. I have a scheduled call with the senator at 9:30 and she made it very clear that she could turn this. Yeah, I'm nervous. It's a big account for us. Have I ever let you down? Speak to me after the call. Okay. Can I help you? Can I help you? - Hi. - Oh, um... I'm sorry. I'll have a, um... Iced latte. - Are you sure? - Yes. Okay. That'll be $2.75. Thanks. I've got an iced latte. Who was here first? - You take it. - No, you were here first. No. No, it's all right. You look like you're in a rush, and I can wait. So, please. - That's so sweet. - My pleasure. Thank you. - Uh, miss. - My God! Where is my head today? Thank you. Hey, come on. What is he doing? Okay. Can I get a little respect, here? I'm about to make a fool out of myself. Karen and I have been together now for, wait for it... - Ten years. Wow. Karen, I adore you. And I just hope that the next 10 years are as amazing as these past 10 have been. Cheers! Mom! You're supposed to read to me. Oh, is that right? - Hi. - Hey, buddy. You look funny upside-down. Then why aren't you laughing? Huh? Huh? How come you're laughing? Let me hear it. There it is! There it is. Okay, mister, it is way past your bedtime. Say good night to everybody. - Good night to everybody! - Very funny. - Up top on the way out, buddy. Okay. All right. - You're a natural. Really? - How's that? - With kids. Oh, yeah. No, I love kids. Especially when you get to play with them a little bit, then give them back to their parents to take them home. Well, I can tell. You're gonna make a good father. That was a beautiful party. Mmm-hmm. What's up? You good? I'm fine. It's not gonna happen, is it? Now, we've already been through this, babe. Exactly. We have been through this and nothing seems to change. Well, we also agreed that we weren't gonna talk about this anymore, remember? When I looked over at you being so good with that little boy, it just... Because I know you don't want that. No, no. I never said that I didn't want that. I'm just... I'm just not ready. We've been dating for almost two years. Yes, and it's been a wonderful two years. I don't want to lose you. I don't either. But I do want a family. I know that! Now, come on. You know my parents. They hated each other when they were together. When they split, it was a relief for everybody. Both of my brothers divorced, my sister divorced. That's two within the last year, okay? Joe, he can't even stand the sight of his ex. And I don't want that. I don't want to wake up one morning hating you. I'm 36 years old. I've been dating my whole life. I'm dated out! I don't want to do it anymore. I want a husband and children. While, while I'm still young enough to enjoy them. I can't do it like this. I can't. I want to propose to you when I'm ready to propose. Not because you feel the need for me to do it right here, right now, at this moment. I don't want to do it like that. I'm sorry. I can't wait for you anymore. So, what are you saying? I think maybe you should go. Yeah, maybe I should. Jesus, Tom, you scared me. I didn't know anyone else was here. I had dinner with a client and realized I left my phone in my office. That the report? All 500 pages of it. Will it pass the committee? I'll let you know in 300 pages. All right, don't work too hard. If only you meant that. I'm serious. It's late! Just pick it up tomorrow. Go home to your boyfriend. Well, we actually broke up a couple of months ago. Oh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't know. No, it's, it's fine. It's better to catch these things early, right? Maybe. My grandfather had a saying. "Life is like a coin. "You can spend it on anything you want, but you can only spend it once." I don't know. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. - Night. - Night. Yes? I'm meeting Karen Hillard. Looks like you're the first to arrive. Would you like to wait at the bar? Hi. What can I get for you? - Ketel One martini. - You got it. I want three reasons why I shouldn't buy you a drink. Well, here's one reason. I already have one. But thanks. I like you. You're funny. Wait a minute. I said wait! Three reasons. - Okay, two. - Two. I'm waiting for someone. So... And three, please refer to two. - Boyfriend? - As a matter of fact, yes. And if he finds me talking to you, he's not gonna be too happy. Mmm. Well then, we better get out of here quickly. - What? - I think you know what I'm talking about. You been waiting long? Uh, yeah. I'm sorry I'm late. You look beautiful. Why are you still standing here? Excuse me? I said, why are you still standing here? Walk away. Whatever. Hope you don't mind. I looked over and it looked like you needed a little help. Thank you. Looks like problem solved, so I'll leave you... Coffee shop. Right? Good memory. Well, now you have to let me buy you a drink. We were just about to leave. We're just here for work drinks. Oh. Oh, okay. But I'm twice in your debt. So... - Leah Vaughn. - Yes? No man in your life? Not anymore. What happened? What happened? Mmm. I... I guess we just wanted different things. Shouldn't be so hard. You're right. It shouldn't be. It's simple. Is it? A lobbyist, huh? I guess you're well-practiced in the art of persuasion. I've been known to get my way. Enough about me. What... Tell me about what you do. I specialize in corporate espionage and network protection. I get a lot of satisfaction out of making sure people feel secure and safe. I can see you'd be good at that. Thank you. No pressure. But if you want to call... What happened to "just one night?" I didn't know it was gonna be a night like this. Good night. Good night. Holy Mother of God! Phillip Whitmore is on Line One. Tell him I'll call him back in five minutes. Okay. - Leah, you have a... Tell him I'll be right there. You have a call on Line One. He says his name is Carter Duncan. Okay, put him through. - Hello? Leah Vaughn. I know I said I wouldn't do this, but here I am. How did you find me? It's 2015, and I'm an I.T. expert. It's not like I don't know your name. Well, I, I guess I should be flattered. I wanna see you again. Well, I don't want to see you at all. What did you have in mind? This is the part of the movie where you kidnap me and sell my organs? It's just business. You understand, right? Oh, my Lord, where am I going? Here to see Winston. All right, man. Watch your step. You like it? I guess we'll see. Come on, let's face it A ghetto education's basic And most ah de youths them waste it And when dem waste it that's when dem take the guns replace it Then dem don't stand a chance at all Two beers. And that's why ah nuff little youth have up some fat 'matic With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket And ah a bleach a night time inna some blackjacket All who nah lock Glocks ah dem a lock rocket Fallen people Listen up! It's never too late to change our luck So don't let them steal your light Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh Don't let them break your stride Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh There is light on the other side And you'll see all the raindrops falling behind It's a revolution Make it out tonight It's a revolution It's a revo... I can't even describe it. I haven't been kissed like that in a long time. So, what are you waiting for? I don't know. Maybe I want to leave it as one of those fantastic memories. Or, you could stop being such a wimp and see where this goes! Who knows? He might be the perfect guy. I thought you didn't believe in all that. Oh, I don't, but we both know you do. Where is he? Don't tell me he's not coming. - He's outside on the phone. - Mmm. What? Girl, you're making me nervous. Stop it! Carter, this is Alicia. Hi, Alicia, how are you? And Karen. - Well, hello. - Nice to meet you. Listen, I have to, uh, run to the... Sorry, it's a really long drive. Wow. Does he have a brother? Your children are absolutely beautiful. Thank you. - You're very lucky. Thank you. You're too sweet. A toast to the most important job on the planet. So, how did you come to appreciate mothers like that? Single mom raise you? Just jump right in with the personal questions. It's all right. I'm adopted, actually. My parents were great, but they're both gone now, so it's just me. I'm sorry. Did you ever try to find your biological parents? - Karen! - Oh... No desire to. Why not? They didn't care enough about me to keep me. As a kid, do you know how that made me feel? Like I wasn't good enough. So, why waste time looking for them? I'm sorry. - Well, I have to confess... - Please don't. No, no, it's just that we heard a lot of great things about you, and, frankly, most people don't live up to the hype. - Karen. No, she's right. You sounded too good to be true. I mean, I was starting to think she was lying. It was laid on a little thick. But, you're all right. - Oh, well. - Yeah, you're all right. Hmm. Oh, I think I forgot my key. I got a spare. Rusty! What are you doing out here? Is everything okay over there? I heard someone scream. Hey, Mrs. McCarthy. It was just Rusty. He startled me, that's all. Oh, this is Carter, my boyfriend. This is Mrs. McCarthy. Pleasure to meet you. Okay, see you tomorrow. I've been wanting to ask you something. But I'm afraid it might be too soon. - Yes. - I haven't even asked you yet. For you, it would always be "yes". Sorry. Do you wanna come with me this weekend to my parents', for the Fourth? It's kind of special, because it's also my dad's birthday. Huh. Don't worry, you're gonna love him. He's an insane, crazy baseball fan. Yes. Nervous? No. Just relax and be yourself. - They're gonna love you. - All right. There she is! My girl! Daddy! Mom! - Oh, sweetie! - Hi! You look good. - This is for you. Happy birthday. - Aw! Oh, thank you. - Hello. - Mom, Dad, this is Carter. It's so nice to meet you, Carter. Glad you could make it. Uh, Mrs. Vaughn, the pleasure is all mine. These are gorgeous. - Mr. Vaughn? - Oh, please! Evelyn and Roger. Let's go get some water. Long drive. You like baseball? Love baseball, actually. I played in high school. Yeah? What position? Pitcher. Well, then, I guess you won't mind parking it here tomorrow and watching the Giants game. - I wish I could. - What's going on in here? Thank you, darling. He says he can't watch the game tomorrow because he got all kinds of plans. Plans? Well, it's just that I got these two tickets to the Giants game, tomorrow. And I was wondering if you'd go with me. Let me see those. - These are behind home plate. Front row. What do you say, Mr. Vaughn? Son, you can call me Roger. This is Justine's old room, Leah's sister. Now, it gets a little hot in here, so you're gonna wanna open up these windows. Mom, you, you're putting him in here? Seriously? Uh, Leah, let's not have this discussion. - You know the rules. - Mother, I am a grown woman. It's okay. This is perfect. Thank you. - Thank you. Good night. Mmm. - Good night. - Good night. What are you doing? This is your parents' house, okay? - Yeah, right. - No, no, no. They want us to sleep apart. You got to be kidding me. Do I, do I look like I'm kidding? Now take your little hussy self back into that hallway and go get in your own bed. Go on. Go on. You don't know what you're missing. Close the door on your way out. Slut. You are unbelievable! Think Daddy likes him? Mmm, probably likes him as much as he can like any guy that's interested in his baby girl. You know, you haven't brought a boy home in a long time, and you never brought Dave here. I don't know, this just feels different. How did you know Daddy was the one? Honestly? I guess it was his perseverance. I was young and playing hard to get, and he told me that I was the love of his life. He wasn't gonna take "no" for an answer. Funny how things work out. What a... Did you get my Daddy drunk? We saw a no-hitter! A no-hitter, baby! Where's my beautiful woman? - Let me get out the way. Yeah! Yeah! - What took you so long? - Mmm. What did you go and do to my Daddy? Oh, I think I just made the boyfriend hall of fame. I couldn't wait till I got home. - Honey, honey. - Hmm? Thank you for this magnificent meal you have provided us and the two beautiful women who prepared it. We thank you, too, Lord, for allowing us to share this day with our new friend, Carter, who has shown us kindness and generosity, and who will forever be welcome in our home. Amen. I just want to say that, uh... Thank you. Thank you. What? What? It's just... I don't want much I just wanna be a better man I love you, Leah. Mmm-mmm Meet me off good luck I was singing with them Jezebels Under perfume sheets, mmm-hmm Got a golden smile Good evening. What can I do for you? Beautiful. I've never seen one in such good condition before. I mean, maybe in a magazine, or at a car show, once. How many miles do you have on it? I have no idea. It's my boyfriend's car. Hey, would you mind terribly if I took a picture of this car? You see, I've been wanting to restore one just like it. I'm sure that's fine. Maybe ask my... Carter! Carter! Carter, stop it! Stop it! Carter! Carter, stop! Stop it! Stop it, Carter! Please! Get your hands off of him! Now! Get in the car. Get in the car! I called the cops! - Leah... - Don't. I don't even know who you are anymore. I love you. Leah. Leah, wait! Just wait. Just wait. Please. Just close the door, please. I've never done anything like that before. I swear. And I'm, - I'm sorry. - I'm gonna go. No, I got it. The proposed legislation isn't done and needs to be revisited. Of course it's not personal. "Personal." Good, I'm glad we're on the same page then. - How did he sound? - He's full of shit. He's not on our team. We need to get the... Does that thing ever stop buzzing? Yeah, sorry. We need to get the committee chair on the... What are you doing here? I was worried about you. Let's talk in my office. You can't just show up here. This is my workplace. Well, I haven't heard from you. I've been really busy. Have dinner with me. - Tonight. - I can't, I have to work. Any night you want. You name it. It was like a switch went off. There was something in his eyes. I've never seen anything like that, ever. Well, have you ever felt threatened by him before? No. Then, maybe it was a one-time thing. He took it too far, but... I don't think you understand. Just listen to what he has to say. Could give you peace of mind. To the future. Leah, this last week has been hell for me. I've been going out of my mind with the thought that I could lose you because of something stupid. "Something stupid?" That was way, way more than something stupid. You were completely out of control. I've never seen anyone do that. You know I'd never hurt you, right? Do I? I love you. I love you, Leah. I love you more than I've ever loved anyone. I knew it from the moment I met you that you were the one. You are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. The one that I want to be the mother of my children. Carter. I've really given this a lot of thought, and I don't think I can get past this. You're upset. You're upset, that's all. That's all. Look, we'll get through it together. Carter. Do you, do you love me? I'm not sure. No, you're not. I don't, I don't know anything anymore. You don't know anything anymore? You don't know? I'm not one of your campaigns where some goddamn poll numbers don't add up. This is a relationship. This is a relationship. It's... Okay. Carter, I am sorry, but we need to move on. We need to, we need to move on. Come on, just... Don't! Leah. And it's triple digits, very dangerous and very unhealthy conditions continuing... Shit. Leah. Leah. Leah! Mr. Duncan, she is not here. She will get the messages when she gets in. He just called. Again. I want you to call and change my home and cell numbers. Yeah, I'm on it. - Hi. - I'll have a small iced latte. That's $3.25. Uh, let me get that. What are you doing here? I'm buying your coffee. No, it's okay. I got it. Keep your money, Carter. I don't need you to buy me anything. Oh, she's an emancipated woman. - It's okay. - Would you just stop it? Leah. Leah! Leah. Stay right there, or I swear to God I'll start screaming. Leah, I'm not trying to scare you. Leave me alone. Leah, open the door. Leah! Open the door! Open the door! Leah! Open the door! I don't know what else to do. I've changed my cell number. I've dodged his calls. I've changed my whole routine. - He's obsessed. - Alicia is right. You saw him beat up that man at a gas station. You said he went crazy. Out of control. Who's to say he won't snap like that again? And next time at you. What are his friends like? Maybe you can talk to one of them. I don't know. I've never met any of them. You've never met any of his friends? - You should go to the police. - You think so? - I would. - Yeah. Miss Vaughn? Have a seat, please. - So, you think someone is stalking you? - Yes. Can you describe the nature of your relationship with this man? We were dating. We broke up a few weeks ago. - Ever since, he's been harassing me. - In what way? He's texting and calling me all hours of the day and night. At work, at home. He's following me. Every time I turn around, he's there, trying to buy me coffee. Has he been violent to you in any way? - No. - Has he threatened you? No, but I know he's capable of violence. I saw him beat someone. Badly. Just for talking to me. Were there charges brought? No. Miss Vaughn, it's not a crime to be in a public place, or buy a girl a cup of coffee, or, sadly, to call someone a hundred times a day. But isn't this stalking or harassment or something? The crime of stalking is difficult to prosecute. We need to prove a pattern of prolonged harassment by the individual. And even then, it's often a matter of "she said, he said". So what am I supposed to do? Just put up with it? Hopefully, he'll see his behavior is getting him nowhere and stop on his own. This is what happens in 95% of the cases. And if it doesn't? We can seek a restraining order, which will prohibit him from coming near you. But, I should warn you that sometimes antagonizes them. Escalates the behavior. Great. I typically advise people in your situation to keep a record of every incident of harassment. If he calls you, texts you, follows you, write it down. This will help give your claim credibility. Call me anytime. And, of course, if you ever feel in any physical danger, call 911 immediately. If we catch him in the act, it makes our job a whole lot easier. Thank you. And I'll manage the remote server until you're fully up to speed. - Great. - That way we can... Mr. Forsythe, can you come out here for a moment? Excuse me, hmm? - Yes, sir. Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Carter Duncan. I understand he's in this office. Uh, in regard to? I have something to deliver to him. Carter Duncan? - Yes. - You're hereby served. This is a temporary restraining order issued by the LA County Sheriff's office. You are legally prohibited from contacting Miss Leah Vaughn. You're further ordered to maintain a distance of no less than 50 yards from Miss Vaughn's person, her residence and workplace. You have any questions, Mr. Duncan? Have a good day. - Mr. Forsythe... - Carter! You better go. Now! Rusty. Rusty. Rusty. Rusty? Rusty! Has Rusty gone missing again? Yeah. - You haven't seen him? - No. Sorry. I'll keep an eye out. Okay. Good night. Rusty! Hi, you've reached Leah Vaughn. I'm not in right now. Leave a message and I'll... I haven't heard from him since I changed my number the last time. Maybe you're in the clear. Yeah, maybe three times is a charm. - Well, be careful. - Okay. Call me tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. God damn it! - Listen, you asshole! Leah? Hey, it's me. Dave? Karen gave me your new number and she told me that you were, um, seeing someone. Oh, I'm not anymore. Really? Listen, you think I can see you? So we can just talk in person? I'd love to see you. I've missed you. I want you to know that I've been thinking about you. A lot, actually. Yeah, me too. I also want you to know that I meant what I said that night. What's that? That I never want to lose you. I love you. I thought a lot about what you said that night, and it's a huge decision. Not to be rushed into. I think I jump into things sometimes. So, how about we do this? How about we start over? Thank you. Thank you. - Thanks. - Enjoy. So, is this okay? You know I love it here. Shit. What? I can't believe he's here. - Who? I'm sorry. Um... - Can we leave? - Leave? Now, please? I don't understand. Who are you looking at? That guy I told you about. Carter. He just sat down at the bar. No, don't. Don't look. Jesus! He, uh... He probably followed us here. - Let's go, okay? - No, no, no. We're not gonna go. Listen, let me handle this. Okay? No. No. Please don't, Dave. I don't want you to antagonize him. He's crazy! I'm just gonna go over there and talk to him, man to man. All right? That's it. It'll be that simple. Carter, right? Do I know you? Just want you to know that you're upsetting the young lady over there. And your presence here isn't welcome. It's a public place, man. What are you doing, man? Huh? She doesn't want anything to do with you, okay? So, maybe it's time you take the hint and move along. Dave, is it? I know all about you. How much of a pussy you were for not stepping up. You think you got a second shot. I get it. You're threatened. Maybe I'm still in the picture. Let me tell you something, man. You are so far out of the picture it's not even funny. Am I? Am I? Look at her. Yeah. Probably remembering the sex right now. - Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Shut up! You mess with her again, you even look at her again, I'm gonna wipe that smug look off your face. Permanently. Try me, okay? I want you to try me. What happened? What did you say to him? I just told him that if he bothers you again, I was gonna rip his head off. You said that? Yes, I said that. I'm not gonna let him mess with you. Okay? See? Apparently it worked. I don't think you have to worry about him bothering you again. You sure you're gonna be okay here tonight? Alone? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, if you ever need anything, just, just give me a call. Leah. Am I wasting my time? No! No. Good night. Good night. You know why you're here? Two weeks ago, you were served a court order to avoid all contact with Leah Vaughn. Oh, yeah. You seem pretty relaxed for a guy with a court order against him. It's just a piece of paper, Detective. Yeah, well, that piece of paper says you're not to come within 50 yards of her. So? So, you violated that order by being in that restaurant last night. It's a public place, Detective. I had no idea she was there. When I was alerted to her presence, I immediately left the premises. I've got witnesses to prove it, including Miss Vaughn herself. In fact, if anyone should be complaining about the way in which they were treated last night, it's me. How's that? Well, when her dinner companion came to me, he grabbed me by the throat and threatened me. I'm no detective, but it seems to me that that's grounds for filing a restraining order against him. What do you think? Let me tell you what I think. I think you better be careful, Mr. Duncan. Because some shit's gonna come down on you, and it's gonna come down hard, if you don't leave that woman alone. You got it? I got it. I'll be watching you, Mr. Duncan. Am I free to go now? Be my guest. He's full of shit. Pull his rap sheet. You got it. What are you doing? Mrs. McCarthy! You startled me. What are you doing? Leah wanted me to wait for her here. She told me you guys broke up. We're back together now. When was the last time you talked to her about it? Um... Never mind. You know, I was keeping an eye out for her. He's never been gone this long. I hope a coyote didn't get him. No. A coyote didn't get him. He'll be fine. I'm gonna hop in the shower. - Would you unzip me? - Of course. - You want to open a bottle of wine? - Mmm. - I won't be long. - All right. Oh, my God. There you go. I need to get my phone. - Be right back. - Okay. Happy birthday, honey. It was my birthday three months ago. I know, but I bought you a present before we broke up. And you kept it? Believe me, I would've taken it back, but I got it engraved. Wow. You like it? I love it. I love it. Let me put it on you. It is beautiful, babe. It's beautiful. I'm never gonna take this off. - Ever? - Ever. Ever! You are incredible, you know that? In... Cred... - He's just playing with me. - I get it. He's out there. He's watching me! He's got my cat. I'm gonna try to get a subpoena to search his apartment. How long will that take? Hopefully, only a few days. In the meantime, I'm digging more, and I'm gonna bring him back in for questioning. We did find out this. Carter Duncan is not Carter Duncan. He changed his name in 2003. All legal, but maybe there's more here than just a jealous ex-boyfriend. - What's going on? - Who are you? I'm Leah Vaughn, her neighbor. Is she all right? Looks like she took a fall down the basement stairs. - Oh, my God. - I'm afraid she's dead, ma'am. - What? - She broke her neck. Oh, my God! When was the last time you saw her? - Ma'am? - I, I, I don't, I don't remember. When did this happen? Forensics thinks it happened some time ago. At least a week. Her daughter, who lives out of town, finally called it in when she didn't return any of her calls. Charlie-22, come in. Ma'am. Oh, my God. - Morning. - Morning. Leah. Just take a message, please, Rachel. Mr. Renkin wants to see you in the boardroom. Now. This is bullshit. That email went out this morning from your account. My account? What? All of our clients have been calling. They're beyond outraged. I don't have to tell you what this'll do to the Prop 37 campaign. Or to the reputation of this firm. And I don't know of any serious advocacy group that won't think twice about asking us to represent them. Tom, I... I can fix this. I can fix it. I don't think you can. We're going to have to suspend you. You know me, Tom. I would never jeopardize my work, my reputation, or the reputation of this company. Yeah, I know, Leah. Just have to see how this plays out but my hands are tied, here. Can't you see I've been set up? That email went to Senator Wharton, too. You know that, right? I know he did this. I know he did. - You need to tell the detective about this. I did. I told him, and he said he would look into it. - Have you talked to Dave? - No. He's in Malibu with a client. I didn't want to distract him. I'll tell him later tonight when he gets home. Thanks again for making the drive. No problem. I'll get these changes to you soon. Thank you. Talk to you soon. Hi, you've reached Leah Vaughn. I'm not in right now. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Hey, I'm just calling to let to know that I'm on my way. I should be there around 11:00. I cannot wait to see you. I love you. What the hell is that? Shh. Hey. Uh, I'm a little worried. It's after midnight, and, uh, you're not home yet. I'm waiting up, so call me, okay? I love you, too. What are you doing here? - We need to talk. - What? - May I come in? - What happened? It's Dave. He was in a car accident. Oh, my God! Is he okay? Leah, I'm sorry. He didn't survive. Oh, my God. No! I'm so sorry. No, no, no, please. No, please. No, no, no. Please, God! According to the report, Dave wasn't wearing a watch at the scene of the accident. But he was. I'd just given it to him. He promised me he'd never take it off. Don't you see? Carter was there. He took the watch and now he's... I want you to know, how we proceed from this point further is critical if we want to catch him. What was his real name again? Robert Adams. He's not who he says he is. He's been lying about everything. Why can't you just arrest him? He changed his name legally. And yes, he's been arrested before for harassment, but nothing ever stuck. That's bullshit! You showed me his record. He's been in and out of trouble his whole life. You said it yourself. He's, what, bipolar? What was it? Bipolar, devolving into psychosis. What they used to call psychopathic behavior. But just because he was diagnosed doesn't mean that... He killed Dave and this is your proof! I can't just keep hauling him in. I need evidence or we'll never get him. I want him just as bad as you do, believe me. We found no surveillance equipment, and there's still no sign of him, sir. Also, no signs of forced entry anywhere. Did you give him a key? Shit! What? He was with me one night when I locked myself out of the house. He saw where I hid my spare key. He's obviously been here. You can arrest him for breaking and entering. Not unless we can prove it. I'll have Forensics look at the watch and the key. If Carter left a print, or if there's even a microscopic trace of Dave's blood on it, then we've got him on breaking and entering. Possibly murder. He's a robot. Turn that thing off. What are you gonna do? I want you to tell me what happened to David King. I don't know David King. Maybe I should talk to Robert. You see, I know who you are, Robert. No. You don't know. Don't I? I know you changed your name 10 years ago. I know you were abandoned by your mother at age two. I know you grew up in foster homes in Illinois. You were in and out of trouble until the age of 17. And I know you have a very high IQ. But, Robert, you're not as smart as you think you are. You hacked into her computer. You broke into her house. You got proof? This look familiar? What if I were to tell you we had your prints on this watch, and we know you moved it from the crime scene? I'd say try harder. It must have killed you to see her with him. Every day, every night. Knowing someone else was kissing her, touching her, having her. And you were watching. Weren't you? You just couldn't stop. Could you? Are we finished, here? Or do you want to talk about something else? Did you hit your head, Robert? I told you to be more careful. The email is untraceable. - It came from your computer. - Of course it did. But you're right. The suicide note? It's a threat. And the watch? Clean. So, you can't protect me? I'm doing everything I can within the law. I think you should go away for a little while. I'm not gonna let him run me off. Maybe your parents? And I'm not gonna put my parents at risk with that sick bastard. Okay. He destroyed everything I care about. And I'm not just gonna roll over. I'm not. I can see that. What would you do? It's time for my coffee break. You're welcome to join me. Excuse me? It's just across the street. What kind of game are you playing with me? You asked me what I would do. I can't give a victim that kind of advice as a member of the force. But there's nothing preventing me from telling a friend a story over a cup of coffee. So, I knew this guy. Someone broke into his house while he was sleeping. After that, he kept a shotgun in his house. It was a 12-gauge Remington. I don't know what that means. Remington is the make. It holds seven rounds, or bullets. But in shotguns, they're called shells. Okay. So he loaded the first two shells with bean bag rounds and the last five with regular shells. You... You lost me. Bean bag rounds are little bags filled with lead shot. The bag is designed to protect the skin from penetration. So, technically, they're classified as non-lethal rounds. So, he loaded the first two shells with bean bags because a non-lethal round qualifies as a warning shot. Why? Firing a warning shot is self-defense, if you're standing in front of a judge. If a perpetrator continues to threaten your safety, any shot after that is justifiable. So... - You're saying... - I'm just telling you a story. What you do with that information on your own time is none of my business. I don't like where this thing is going. We're talking because maybe this ends badly. You don't want that. Okay? And neither do I. Is she the next victim? Excuse me? What's going on here? Oh, you don't know me now? Don't believe a word this piece of shit tells you. He fed me the same lies, and then he stalked me. And then, he murdered the man I was gonna marry. She's lying. Oh, and he's very charming. And persistent. Nothing will stop him, not even restraining orders or the police. I think I should go. Good idea. Do not walk. Run. While you still can. Murderer. Leah, where are you? Alicia and I are worried about you. We've left you so many messages. You gotta call us back. Please. Who is it? - Delivery. Rusty. Oh. From the looks of it, it all seems very impressive. As I said, I look forward to working with you in the future. - And don't worry about that... Sorry to interrupt. You lost? No. Take one more step and you're gonna feel lost. Put the gun down. Please, Leah. - What the hell was that? - A warning. You're not gonna kill me. - God! - Maybe not. But I got five more like it, and they will fuck you up! Something funny? Looks like I lied. Ma'am, are you okay? Can I help you? I'm here to see Detective Hansen. Hansen! Come inside. I want to report an intruder. This is Hansen. I need a couple of units, Code Three, at 12177 Lockhaven Road. Got it? Are you okay? I am now.
