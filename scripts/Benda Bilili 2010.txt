And I'II take the camera he's hoIding too. I wouIdn't think twice, I'd just ''comb'' him. I don't mind being a thief. Any 12-year-oId Iiving on the streets shouId do that. I sIeep on cardboard, man. Just Iook around... We're in a concrete jungIe. Kids don't have a choice. You sIeep outside, you suffer from the coId. This country is screwed. ''Combing'' is the onIy system. You have to watch your back, we're in a jungIe. It's survivaI of the fittest. Give us something! We're starving! Come on, sir! How are you? I waited yesterday. Nobody came to rehearsaI. - I was heId up. - HeId up... That's OK. Where are the others? They're on their way. It's tough to rehearse these days. Don't worry, we'II work hard. Ever present. Your humbIe servant. We've known Staff Benda BiIiIi for a Iong time. Papa Ricky is the street kids' oId man. He has aIways heIped us out here, at the Sonas Roundabout. Papa Ricky is the boss, he conducts the orchestra. l used to sleep on cardboard Bingo, l bought a mattress lt could happen to you To you, to him, to them A man's life is never over Luck shows up unannounced lt's never too late in life l know we'll succeed someday l used to sleep on cardboard Bingo, l bought a mattress lt could happen to you To you, to him, to them A man's life is never over Luck shows up unannounced lt's never too late in life l know we'll succeed someday No one can judge a man's life Life comes and goes No one can judge a street child's life We don't get to choose our lives The kids at the Mandela roundabout are big stars They sleep on cardboard The handicapped people at the Platform are big stars They sleep on cardboard We have cardboard! Who are you to make fun of me? Who are you to make fun of me? AppIaud! Thank you, cardboard. JULY 2005 When we met Staff Benda Bilili on their street corner, we were in Kinshasa, making a film about urban music- Like the majority of Congolese people, Benda Bilili were just about surviving, their only weapons being their talent and an unwavering optimism- We fell in love at first sight with these unknown virtuosos- They sang of life on the streets and of getting by in this cruel city- Their music went straight to our hearts- lt got us thinking- lt wouldn't take much to help them record an album- So we decided to do just that with our own money- For these disabled, veteran street musicians we presented an opportunity not to be missed, but we never imagined our collaboration would last five years- It's OK, I taIked to them. We came to an agreement. Are they going to pay us more? No, we don't get more dough. We've negotiated. They warned us that they were broke. They're giving us the cash to pay the soIoists. We have to make an effort or it won't work. They pay for our smokes, our food... With their money! And weed. We have to come to an agreement so we can keep going. We can't mess things up. That's how we have to Iook at it. SHELTER FOR THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED l was born a strong man But polio got me Look at me today l'm screwed onto my tricycle Here l am, with my canes l've become the man with canes These damn crutches What a mess Responsible mums Go to vaccination centres To vaccinate their babies Against poliomyelitis To eradicate buka buka Parents, listen to me Stop neglecting your kids The one who has polio As well as the one who's able-bodied There's no difference between them Who knows which one will help you later? God in heaven I don't make anything up. My songs are about my Iife. In one song we say, ''Your job is Iike your parents'.'' Here, if you don't take your job seriousIy, you're signing your death warrant. My wife whines when I Ieave to go rehearse for three weeks. She doesn't understand what I do. She wants me by her side but I'm working for our chiIdren's future. If I die tomorrow, they'II say, ''Daddy did nothing for us.'' If I die, what wiII I be Ieaving them? A sewing machine? They won't have anything, not even a roof over their heads. With the music I've composed, it's different. If it's successfuI in Europe, it'II bring money every year. My kids wiII be saved. Ju, come over here. Come and try this on. This year, you're going to schooI. This is your uniform. Do your best. If you compIain, you won't get to go to schooI anymore. Go get your sister. The ante is 100 francs. Let's raise it to 500. You're cheating, guys. Come on, the ante. Let's see the cash. You pinched my money. You owed him 200. I aIready paid him. You're swindIing me out of 100 francs! CaIm down. Come on, Iet's pIay. OUTSIDE THE ''PLEIN VENT'' RESTAURAN DOWNTOWN KINSHASA Go on, Coco, your friends are Iistening. They can hear you in Europe. Europe heard us! I'm a street daddy. You're a street kid. So how are we different? You have music. - We... - You don't have anything? You couId be... How about Staff dancers? You can pIay the drums, can't you? Yes. So you can pIay music. - Can't you? - AbsoIuteIy. Come to rehearsaI tomorrow, at the zoo. THE KINSHASA ZOO Work, work! Yourjob is like your parents' Work, and work even more! That's Adam. It's his fauIt that it hurts to give birth. It's because the man crawIed onto the woman's stomach. Here, Adam and Eve hadn't eaten the fruit yet. Things were good back then. PeopIe even pIayed with Iions. Our country is screwed, man. Man, you know what? I was here before they ate the fruit. One day you'd eat and the next day you wouIdn't be hungry. - Whatever. - I'm teIIing you. No one was ever hungry back then. And then the country changed and I started starving to death. AII because of Adam and Eve. How do you make a Iiving? - I wash cars in town. - That's your job? - And I'm a drummer. - What eIse? Other than that... I do what I can. - Do you beg? - Yes, I'm a beggar. I spend every Christmas on the streets. For the Iast five years. Five years! I'd reaIIy Iike to have a house. My job is to push the... ...the handicapped peopIe's bicycIes. I do that aII day Iong and they give me money and food. My parents are both aIive. But they don't have enough money to send me to schooI. You know, a man's Iife is never over untiI the end. Nobody is doomed. I'm Iike the branch of a tree. Whether I'm happy or in pain, I hang in there. But in the end, I'II end up in a trashcan. I use this instrument to make a Iiving. We, the CongoIese, heIp each other out. I use my instrument to pIay a few weII-known tunes. If peopIe Iike it, they give me something. I don't pick the pockets of the peopIe who waIk by. That's not why I'm here. I'm making a Iiving from my instrument. Thanks to this, I'II be abIe to feed my mother and my IittIe brothers soon. If I cross paths with someone who has a good heart, who couId support me so that I couId work on my music, I'II do great things with this instrument. The day after we meet him, we introduce Roger to the Staff Benda BiIiIi musicians. Other than that, is everything OK? We're aII here. Try to pIay in the right scaIe. Yeah, I'm trying. First I have to tune this. It's the IittIe soIoist. I can pIay haIf tones. With that thing? He can pIay aII the notes! It's the neck over there that produces the tone. I'm curious to hear it. He rocks! Roger, come a IittIe cIoser. LittIe Roger... TeII me, what's your race? - Age? - No, race. What tribe? I'm Mayumbe. From Lower Congo? Is Mayumbe in Lower Congo? In which viIIage do you Iive? In Kisenso. It'II take time and work. I'm going to work with him for a whiIe. If he works hard, he'II become a good guitar pIayer. I see that... he's stiII young. In time, in three or four years, he'II do good things. On the side. That's good. For the handicapped, life is a battle One day you eat, the next you don't ln life, the wheel of fortune turns my friend Never forget that Never forget that What's that white guy fiIming? What's your probIem? Did he fiIm you? Are you the poIice? You're in our way! You're screwing up my work. Whatever. Are you from a smaII viIIage? Haven't you ever seen a camera in your Iife? You do nothing in Iife. Leave us aIone, you idiot! SHELTER FOR THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED BANDAL NEIGHBOURHOOD He's starting to get it. Is it something Iike this, man? It's coming, IittIe by IittIe. No, you're aIready in tune. I have to get it. My mother has been sick since her divorce. My father hit her. He hit her on the head and she was traumatised. She spends aII day at home Iike that, without any money. With my IittIe brothers there, it was Iike a henhouse. I had to Ieave home to Iive my Iife. I didn't run away. I'II go back when I've succeeded. Now that I'm a member of the Staff Benda BiIiIi, everything's going to be OK. I'm patient. I know my time wiII come. They pIay reaIIy weII. September 2005, after one month of rehearsaI, Staff Benda BiIiIi enter a studio for the first time. STUDIO I.C.A, KINSHASA, LINGWALA NEIGHBOURHOOD No, stop. Like we said, if someone messes up, we start over. Let's start over. No! It's the soIo, damn it. Concentrate. We're on the second verse. Roger, tomorrow at noon. We'II meet here at noon. Staff Benda Bilili Try to understand What you need to do to pull through this rotten life The girls on the streets are crying They want to hear Staff The children on the streets are crying They want to hear Staff Ju! Come in here. PuII curtain, we're going to bed. And cIose the door. It's reaIIy perfect. Papa Ricky? It's your wife. We Iost everything. There was a fire. Everything! The whoIe sheIter burned down. I couIdn't saIvage anything. No, not just us. Everyone's in the same position. I just got here. Everything burned down. It happens. That's Iife. This is my youngest son. We had four. Four chiIdren. Tonight, he was supposed to sIeep at the BandaI SheIter. Why is he so sick? I don't know. Maybe it's because I don't breastfeed him anymore. I just stopped. It seems Iike you don't want to have any more babies. More babies? I hope you're kidding. The fire that destroyed central Bandal started during a recording session- Overnight Benda Bilili had ended up back on the streets with their families- They were facing problems of basic survival- Despite all Ricky's efforts, work in the studio had become impossible- There was no point- Weeks passed and the group broke up- Roger went back to his village- With heavy hearts, we decided to return to France- We gave Ricky our last remaining dollars and promised him we'd find a way of finishing the album- One year later, backed by a record label, we were back in Kinshasa- JULY 2006 This is my business. Without this, I couIdn't make it. With this, everything is OK. It's Benda BiIiIi. The Benda BiIiIi Store. OPPOSITION DENOUNCES ELECTORAL FRAUD In the hopes of finishing the aIbum, Ricky tries to find the musicians and take up rehearsaIs. GOD IS THE ONLY ONE PROTECTING THIS VEHICLE Who's waiting for us down there? Is it near GambeIa? Towards GambeIa? Or is it near Ngiri Ngiri? Avenue KwaIu? KwiIu? Near the City CounciI? There's no way. Where are you going, oId guy? I'm Iooking for Roger. Do you know him? He pIays the monochord. With a miIk tin. - The thing that goes ''gIing gIing''? - That's it. He pIays soIos. Do you know where he Iives? - The guitar with the tin? - That's right. - He Iives in Lemba Imbwa. - Where is that? - Very far away. - You'II show me. - Can we drive there? - That's impossibIe. Forget it, I'II never find him. Push through that way. I'm going to die! Mums and dads, trust in God! Don't Iook back! You can't miss those years of unempIoyment! Don't expect too much from the eIections because onIy God can bring peace back to Congo. PeopIe of Congo, who wiII you beIieve? PeopIe of Congo, in whom wiII you pIace your hope? PIace it in the hands of God! He who restored the peopIe of IsraeI! He is the same yesterday, today and for aII eternity! HaIIeIuiah! God wiII visit our sons. God wiII visit our country, He wiII visit our famiIies. God wiII restore this country, God wiII bIess this country. Let's appeaI to Him. Let Him hear our Iament. By the victorious bIood of Jesus! - President. - Yes? There you are. We have a Iot of work ahead of us. RehearsaI starts at two. Practice the song we taIked about. KINSHASA ZOO September 2006, the producer Vincent Kenis meets us in Kinshasa with his portabIe studio. For the first session, he records them where they rehearse: the zoo. These mosquitoes... Marguerite, my sister Marguerite, my sister We were born of the same father But other children were born after us Our families separated Today, you're on one side of the river, and l'm on the other The only thing left between us is Vodacom The only thing left between us is Telecel And l'm left here all alone And l'm just left here One day l eat, the next l don't Everyone has their lucky day Today it's you, tomorrow it's him Your time will come soon Marguerite in Brazza, Coco in DRC Separated by this damn river Come on, puII them out.

We have to go back to studio. We screwed up some of the songs. We have to do them over. We have to fix it, we have to concentrate. So we messed up? Before, our probIems got in the way of our work. We kept messing up, we had to do severaI takes. We're recording for the third time. Our sound engineer came back. This time, we'II get it right. Let's put our probIems - the fact we sIeep on cardboard - aside untiI we have an aIbum in our hands. Coco, how are you? SEPTEMBER 2007, GOMBE HALL Our work here is done. It sounds beautifuI. Great music. The new sound of the worId. The worId's new idoI is Staff Benda BiIiIi. It wiII be the event. Never in the history of the worId has this been seen. ''Unmixed - unedited''.

Staff Benda BiIiIi! Very, very strong! You're missing 40? Here. You can't count, huh? You're a bad secretary. It's Roger's turn. Tomorrow, you'II pay your mum's hospitaI biII. She can't come out untiI you pay. Get your mother out of the hospitaI. AII right? And 10 doIIars for you. Share, OK? - Who's the oIdest? - He is. You think you can steaI from me? - I'm Iike your father! - It wasn't me, man! I didn't do anything, man! We're aII on the streets, I wouId never do that! Roger, we're on the same team. Beat him up, Roger! Did you steaI from me? Go to the cops! Do you want to end up in jaiI? - Why did you do that? - Man, I promise... Don't you dare do it again! Man, you're our President. Let's drink champagne. We're here to ceIebrate! We have two bottIes to share. - That's for us. - The ''outside sIeepers''. Today we're going to party! Get out of here. This champagne is a present from Staff Benda BiIiIi. It's our movement. If we put our destinies in your hands, we'II go far. If you go too fast, break with your butt. Benda BiIiIi are paving the way. Drink, IittIe guy. This is my part. Tres tres fort, their first album coming out in France- And they really are very, very strong- Picture an orchestra of paraplegics living on the streets- Their rehearsal room is the Kinshasa zoo--- We're right here. They'll be playing in the very big festival, the Eurockeennes in Belfort- Bravo! Thank you, my friend! We'II be in Europe soon. That's so cooI! I'd Iike to know... What is there in Europe that's so great? I see peopIe who are ready to die to go to Europe. I am too. But what's over there? WeII, it's a country... It's a country that not everyone can go into. Some can, others can't. - It's a country... - Not everyone gets in? Like I said, some can go in, others can't. So it's a country... God made that country so that... So that we couId compare it to ours. So too many peopIe want to go there. We're Iucky that at Ieast God aIIowed our fathers to go to Europe. They'II make Iots of dough over there. And we'II benefit from it. We'II have good Iives, we'II have houses, a good inheritance... They dream of going to Europe too. They've been put in a cage, Iike prisoners. Like a bird, l'll fly All the way to beautiful Europe Like a bird, l'll fly All the way to beautiful Europe The day Roger was oId enough to go to schooI, I bought his uniform, his schooI suppIies... And on the first day of cIass, he soId everything! He said, ''Mum, schooI won't get me to Europe. ''This monochord thing wiII.'' - What's it caIIed? - A satonge- A satonge? He said his satonge wouId get him to Europe. I have nothing to say. You can see how we Iive. Ever since you were born, I've had nothing but probIems. You know how you were born, how I had to raise you, how much I suffered. Me, your mother. You know aII that. Not too Iong ago, I couIdn't Ieave the hospitaI because of a 100 doIIar debt. Don't mess around over there. If you faiI, it'II kiII me. You can fooI around here but over there they have the Law. If you mess up and they send you back, the others wiII make fun of us. The famiIy despises us because I'm raising deIinquents. I want your bad-mouthing uncIes to know that the deIinquent went to Europe. Tomorrow there wiII be no teasing, no disdain. Put them to shame, shut them up. You have to behave over there. We're counting on you. Your two oIder brothers didn't make it. It's up to you to do your best to feed your famiIy. Your brothers couIdn't do it so you have to take their pIace. Thanks for the advice, that was heIpfuI. JULY 2nd 2009 So today's the big day, President. You're aII jeaIous. - Papa Coco. - Yes? WiII you bring me a doII? Yes, I'II buy you one. And for you too.

You didn't eat anything. That's OK, we'II eat over there. Don't cry. I'II bring you a bike. Black man, wake up Get up and you'll understand From the beginning of time All you've done is sleep too much Wake up and you'll see the sun Already high in the sky Look in front of you Your rivers are teeming with fish Look behind you Your forests are packed with game The ground you walk on is full of gold and diamonds Black man--- - This airport is... - Roissy. - Roissy. - Roissy-CharIes-de-GauIIe. We have to knock 'em dead, here in France. Let's give them aII we've got, so they'II remember us. Then other countries wiII invite us. The stakes are high for this concert. Did you see the chickens here? They're huge. They seII us the skinny ones. But they give us a good price. It's a beautifuI city. The city of de Bedfort. BeIfort! JULY 5th 2009 EUROCKEENNES FESTIVAL, BELFORT, FRANCE After the concert, you'II go meet the girIs! They'II aII come and say, ''I Iove you.'' But be carefuI, it's not Iike the Congo here.

It's hot out. l'm an orphan, alone in the world My parents died a long time ago My daddy told me never to steal He'd say, ''Listen to me and you'll live a long life'' Kids don't listen anymore They join gangs, the Kuluna Our advice goes out the window it's so hard There's nothing to eat at home so they join the Kuluna Delinquents, gangsters, the Kuluna What's the solution? The Kuluna What's this Kuluna business, Roger? Tell us about it Before he died, my daddy said, ''lf you want to live a long life, avoid problems ''And respect the world's principles'' l'm just a kid, l have a long way ahead of me l listened to my old man And l'm still alive Young man, your parents are there to help you Being in a gang is short-term You're playing with your life, little brother Very, very strong! We're visiting Iots of countries. After Germany, we're off to Denmark. We won a trophy. Tomorrow they've giving us a trophy because we won. And then we're taking a pIane to another country.

No more credit! l used to sleep on cardboard l used to sleep on cardboard You have to be strong, right? The work mentaIity. Work is serious business. We're serious, sure, but we're freezing our asses. - It's freezing! - It's tough. They don't fooI around here. If you mess up, you turn into an ice cube. They were wrong, those who didn't beIieve in us. Staff was our project. And today that project is coming to Iife. It's becoming a reaIity. Hey, my friend, never forget Today you have a plate but you used to eat on the ground Hey, my friend, never forget Today from a plate, tomorrow, on the ground My friend, don't forget Don't forget the wind can blow the other way Never forget Hey, President. This is the Argentinean Ambassador's wife. - Argentinean? - The Ambassador's wife. PIeased to meet you. - She speaks French. - PIeased to meet you. You speak French?

Staff, straight ahead Benda Bilili How do you pull through Your rotten life? Carried by Staffs love, we will never die ln Staffs hands, we get ahead ln Staffs hands, we get ahead Our leaders don't care about us We stay strong no matter what Our leaders don't care about us We only count on each other Staff Benda Bilili! You have to understand ln order to pull through your rotten life This whisky is strong! Drink up. Come on, a IittIe for Papa Ricky. - Is there any weed around? - Yeah, I Iike that better. We'II get in troubIe. Smoking weed is serious here. You can't get caught. I heard they have marijuana detectors. - Those things on the ceiIing? - No, those are just... If the smoke gets too thick, they throw water everywhere. Everything's wet and you have to Ieave the hoteI. - ImmediateIy. - You Ieave your room right away. You have to watch out. Of aII of us, the one who was most affected by our success is Roger. It reaIIy stirred him up. You shouId see the kid in his neighbourhood. He's become a music master in his neighbourhood. - He bought a TV. - A TV and everything! - A couch. - A mattress. He organised his Iife. At 18, Roger has become a man. He'II have a house, he's straightening himseIf out. I guarantee you, this kid wiII do great things. Papa Ricky knows that his chiId has grown up. He knows I'm making progress. He knows his chiId has a future in Staff Benda BiIiIi. He often says, ''We're going to die soon. ''We're getting oId, you have to take over the orchestra.'' We've suffered together. Ricky knows I come from far away. I want him to know that he can count on me. TransIation: Ana Zappa SubtitIes TITRA FILM Paris
