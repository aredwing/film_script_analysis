The cholera makes no distinction. For a long while nobody knows who's dead and who got away to the hills. Nobody knows but the vultures circling . . . waiting Mostly this is what you have afterwards An empty place with no breathing soul . . . It's not England, Barney. I venture to say that you'll get used to it. You haven't been here long enough I have . . . . Sadea and 'er husband, no children identified. I had tea on this verandah once John Lennox, Mrs John Lennox If I'd been a Captain or better they'd have asked me again. Remember Barney, I told you, the cholera makes no distinctions. Who are you? I might ask, miss, who are you? My name is Mary Lennox and you haven't answered my question. Where's my servant ? where's cook ? Sadee said my servant was ill and then Sadee never came back. Are you a relative of the Lennox's? I told you my name was Mary Lennox My father is Mr John Lennox and my mother is Mrs John Lennox. They went away. They're always going away. Your servants . . . some of your servants became very ill They . . . they died. The others were frightened, . . . they ran away to the hills. I knew it, . . . I knew they didn't all die. Mother's right, she says you can't trust natives. She ran away, didn't I tell you. Humph !! . . he's a silly looking man, isn't he? . . with a silly looking hat. They was identified Sir. Well, be certain Mr & Mrs John Lennox check it again They died at the hospital Sir. No mistake What's up Sir? what's in there? Their little girl. I never knew they had any children. Who's he? Well he's my orderly, his name is Barney. Why does he look so funny? You needn't stand up, you're an officer, aren't you? You'd better stand I'm not supposed to be in here at all you know if Mama should catch me, oh .... You never come in here Mary? Of course not. Children aren't permitted in the front of the house. Don't you know anything? I came here once I didn't see you. Is that why? Of course it's why. She'll never see those . . . I never even knew Mrs Lennox had a little girl. Has she any more children? No well can't you see I'm the only one here in the house. Oh I meant home in England perhaps? Have you a Grandmother ? Somebody else home in England? Haven't you any Aunts or Uncles? What's wrong with that man? He's a common soldier, he should be standing at attention. Barney..... Yes Sir! He looks funny. Never mind about Barney. There's something I've . . . . . . . got to tell you. I shant be very good at it. So you'll, . . you'll have to forgive me. You see, I knew your mother. She was a very beautiful woman. I knew your father too. He was a fine man. But w. w.. what I'm trying to say is You must trust me They're dead too Ma ma didn't go away, she died ! I know how you loved her. Stop talking!

I'll laugh and laugh and laugh . . . . .make everybody go away. . . Mary? . . . . . I'm tired goodnight Go to sleep My father always said that some day I'd be like him He likely believes it Grownups can be awfully silly But let's not think about him It's been so awfully long since I've seen you Tell me a story Mary Tell me a story about what you've been doing I can't Colin Please Well it's a secret Dickon and I have a secret . . I never see anybody I don't have any secrets Could I meet Dickon someday ? Why of course . . . I'll bring him to see you tomorrow Tell me some kind of story Mary Well . . . . once upon a time . . it isn't a true story of course . . . but once upon a time . . . . there was a secret garden. . . . . oh it was a lovely garden . . with walls all around . . . . with vines and flowers . . . . . and grownups never came there . . only children . . It was just like the make believe garden . . . only it wasn't make believe the Lilacs and the Tulips . . . . . and the Daffodils with the most beautiful flowers of all the world . . and no one could see them . . . just the children Oh and the children were so happy . .they were never mean and they never quarrelled Sometimes we wished . . . all the children in all the world . . . . .could have a secret garden . . . . just like this. . . Hello . . . this is Dickon Hello Hello She wants a bit of breakfast She very starving It was mean not to feed her sooner But I thought thar might like to feed her Yeah . . . . . . . that's right . . just like a baby . . What's that ? It's a fox cub . . . Dickon found it on the moors His name's Captain He's what you might call a volunteer. . Colin Can you keep a secret ? . .but you've got to swear it on blood or something. . What secret ? Here . . swear on this key that you'll never never tell . . Tell what ? Well how can I tell you unless you swear How can I swear unless I know what I'm swearing about ? We can tell him Mary It's just about an old garden . . . and that's the key . . and our own garden . . . . full of things in bloom . . and lovely smells . . and no one's been in it for ten whole years . . . . but just Mary and me .. The 'Secret Garden' ? Mary I thought it was just a story you were making up . . why I dreamt about it last night . . Aye and Mary and me , we think of nought else, . . since we first found it We dreamed how fine it could be . . and the weeds all gone . . . and the roses pruned . . . . and none but us to see it. . We must take you there so thou may see it Oh that's Dickon, he's always talking Yorkshire . then he gets me talking . . Must thou talk Yorkshire ? no you don't have to do anything Just swear that you won't tell . .and then we'll show the garden to you ! I never go outdoors . . . Servants look at me and . . . anyway that stupid old Doc Griddlestone's coming this morning He's bringing another Doctor from London and . . . . they'll probably say I'm worse Well don't pay any attention to any old doctors . . and about the servants . . . all you have to tell them is to keep out of the garden They have to do what you say You'd do us a big favour Don't say anything Swear ! I swear Oh ! oh ! . never in all my life . . . . my wig! . .my wig. . my wig . . give me my wig . . my wig! . . I'm Doctor Fortescue You'll pardon me my boy but I practice in London Is all this customary on a rural call ? I'm beginning to understand why your father thought Doctor Griddlestone needed a little help . . and if you're the patient and I presume you are I wonder if you'll live to such a ripe old age. And what are these for ? I can't walk I can believe you my boy . . If I had to live in this house, I'd want to stay safe in bed too You're old enough, why don't you just retire ? Doctor Fortescue, I'm so ashamed What did you lose ? What ? I thought you said this boy was ill ? I beg your pardon Sir ? Why don't you sell that stuff to the rag and bone man? What are you trying to do, build a bridge ? You speak most unprofessionally Sir ! If you think that what happened this morning to . . . . poor Doctor Griddlestone . . has ever happened before. . . you're wrong NEVER in this house ! I assumed such things never happened before, if they had . . he'd be a different boy If I speak unprofessionally Doctor it's because I haven't the slightest hope of influencing you It's my safe assumption though that the walls have ears and that the walls can understand what you cannot What kind of doctor is this ? He's mad ! I shall report your conduct to Mr. Craven You will and he'll back you up, not me I diagnosed this case, accurately I believe , when I met the father Examining the child was a formality How dare you say such things in front of the patient ! I speak in front of the patient with purpose Fear is a disease. . . . fear can waste muscles. . . .destroy men, paralyse nations . . You're not the first my boy, nor the last I prescribe fresh air, . . exercise, . . wild animals and children . . and take off those irons ! I write the prescription on the wind You ! . . terrible children ! The irons stay on You can rest assured Doctor, I take my orders from you Thank you Mrs. Medlock Tis of course for Mr. Craven to decide. I'll report the whole matter to him . . without prejudice Doctor Griddlestone I'm going outdoors . . You're not ! . . you'll catch cold You'll allow me to go outdoors Mrs Medlock or I can make myself quite difficult You'll tell the servants to stay in the house Dickon will wheel me Tell Ben Weatherstaff and the gardeners to work in the green houses I'll have no one about Doctor Griddlestone . . . In India Mrs. Medlock it's the custom to do as you're told That wretch !!! Let him have his way . . . . . poor boy . . He's had a difficult time of it I may say I've had a difficult time of it myself. . . . I'm good, thank you Oh Doctor Griddlestone, I assure you that this will never happen again Good day . Good day Mrs. Medlock . . good day. Oh no . . . Not again ! It's right in there behind those bushes Dickon . . . right now Before thy goes in I want to know right now . . Colin. . . Go away Ben . Go to the green houses Weatherstaff. . . . You were told to work in the greenhouses! You were wonderful Colin I hoped I might walk Could you wheel me ? Aye ! I was so frightened the first time, I could hardly turn the lock . . These are roses .. Those are Lilacs . . See the little lake ? I shall live forever I shall live forever . . . Send the gentleman in . . Good evening Doctor Fortescue Good Evening Mr. Craven Sit down Brandy ? No thank you . . Last Spring you went up to my country place to examine my son I had your report . I resented it ! Naturally Now after some months you write me a letter Your fee was paid at the time of the examination I've assumed that you regarded your services as ended I resented your report I regard the letter as outrageous ! Naturally You persist in regarding me as the patient as well as my boy Perhaps I should double my fee . . . Why did you write that letter ? Curiosity I may tell you Doctor Fortescue . .that when I engaged you, I assumed you were a doctor of medicine . . Would it be impudent Sir ? . . . . . . to call a physician of your standing an imposter ! . . and a most dangerous charlatan ! It'd be impudent I'm an impudent man myself Mr. Craven, I could understand There is his mother . . . you asked I may tell that our marriage was the one superbly happy experience in my less than happy life . . and if you imply otherwise I shall kill you ! Don't I believe you . For ten years Doctor Fortescue . . my sanity has been a matter of . . . . shall we say . . . . touch and go. I've walked the most delicate balance between the Gods and lightning . . between life and the chasm I have buried certain memories with utter care I have vilified others . . I don't enjoy the prospect of going insane Your letter Doctor Fortescue has made my balance no easier That was it's purpose You are a passionate man Mr. Craven You may leave ! That's a fine boy you have up there, you ought to go and see him once in a while I said you may leave ! I'm not too concerned with what happened between you and your wife I'm a doctor, not a detective I do know though that some kinds of memories won't stay buried . . . and so we have to bury the patient. What does concern me is the boy You said in your letter that I wanted him to die. . . Did I ? . . . well I'm not too diplomatic a man. . It's a technical point anyway. I just suggest . . . Well perhaps while you were keeping your . . own balance . . with such care . . you transferred your longing to die to your son. Leave my house !!! You ! . . . . you're a normal man . . . . . . do you know what it is to be ugly ? . . . . to be cursed. . and set apart ? to live in fear . . to be hated for things you can't help ? . . to be pitied. . . . to see your curse in every mirror . . . . prying eyes in every face. Your son is as normal as I am You lie !!! Well . . . . . I should be going . It's been a fascinating case Mr. Craven Give my regards to the children when you see them. I enjoy children. Good night Would thou call it an 'Everlast of Summer' , Dickon ? Aye . . There's a smell of rain in the air What a fine summer it's been What with diggin and weedin and eating your mother's bread and jam, I'm fat like a pig ! Listen to the way thy talk. . Why , I'm fat too I haven't got a single wrinkle left in my stocking Perhaps we shouldn't laugh Doctor Griddlestone's getting suspicious He keeps asking me what we've been doing ? I can hardly get my irons on anymore . . They aren't big enough . . It's Mrs. Medlock I'm worried about . . First she got suspicious because we ate too much . . . . . and then when we started bringing things from your house . . . and ate hardly anything at home . . . then she got more suspicious She's a suspicious woman Should I give her the sack ? No that wouldn't do any good . . . . your father would just come back from London Do you know what I think, Colin ? I think you should have a tantrum A tantrum ? What if he doesn't feel like it ? He doesn't have to feel like it I don't think I could have a tantrum even if I wanted to . . Colin? . . . not even for our secret ? Just like Dickon says, I don't feel like it. . . miff. . Thar could have one . . Somebody has to have a tantrum . . . Dickon's not the sort . . fake it . . oh dear . . . I don't feel like a tantrum either . . ohhh. . What's wrong with us ? . . What's wrong with him ? He's angry It must be the coming of winter ! . . There ! Run and hide ! I can't . . Dickon ! . . quick ! Open the gate. . I hate him . I hate him . . He and the others are discharged ! You have no right to be here, Weatherstaff Nor has thee . . . . get thee back to the house Fine I suppose you'll tell Mrs Medlock I've known where thy was all summer and I've said nought I beg of thee . . . I beg of thee . . get back to the house . . I'll have no one working here who knows I can't tell you what'd happen if he found me here If who found you here ? The father . . . The father's here with some gentleman from London Let him not find thee here I beg of thee Dickon I hate you . . . . . I hate everybody !! Dickon Heaven help me from coming through the hall and getting lost in this ghost trap Twas easier coming up the vine Dickon what is it? .. what's happened ? Can thy find a way to Colin's room ? . . yes . . Take hold of me hand Mary . If I get lost in this wuthering houses, I'll show you what a tantrum is . . . Mary I thought it was going to be my father . . Thar hasn't seen him yet ? . . . all this time ? Then I'm not too late W.. what are you doing here this time of night ? What's happened ? When thar sees the father, say nought about the garden Of course I wouldn't I would. . . just the same . . when I tell you Ben's story . . Ben Weatherstaff came to me . . Ben ? Tonight . . . and me in bed . . and the wind howling . . and it's Ben off the moors . . . Dickon . . Ben . . a mans so afraid I've never seen . . . afraid to tell . . . . yet failing to come to thee or Mary, thou they might not listen . . so he came to me What did he say ? Then there was the old table and broken chair . . . and the axe in the old Oak tree Thy mother . . . . Mary and me, we knew . . Never told thee . . Dickon Ben was there . . he told me all It was an accident Mary, we were wrong to suspect Suspect what ? Tis of no importance Your father loved your mother like none can tell . . . . or so Ben says. Twas her garden . . . . and every afternoon they took their tea under the oak . . and none was there . . . but old Ben tending the roses . . and then . . . . . one day . . the limb fell. The men carried your mother back to the house . . and there she died after thee was born Why do you have to tell me about . . I must Colin . . the garden . . Ben stayed in the garden all that night . . he can't say why, he just did With the sun not up yet, your father came back His eyes were bloody ghosts from the Weepy .. . . and his mind gone from him .. and an axe in his hand . . the axe He tried to chop down the tree He tried to kill the tree that killed thee mother Chopping . chopping . . . . and the tree's stronger than thee father's crippled back He couldn't chop it down Colin . . and he fell to the ground . . with the axe still in the tree . . and the tree not dented . and he wept like a man crazy . . . and he cursed at Ben when Ben wouldn't finish the chopping . and then . . twas sun up. . and thee father got up from the ground . .and he was a man, different . . and changed . . and his eyes were like ice . . yet . . burning He swore how he'd lock the garden and bury the key . .and if ever a human being laid eyes on it again He'd see the garden destroyed . . . forever more He'd tear out the vines, the roses , the lilacs . . he'd see the trees cut down and nothing left He'd mix salt with the earth and blight the dirt That was what he swore Our garden . . . Just ten years ago . . a man can change . . I can't believe hed still do it You don't know it! What kind of a man is it that would kill a growing thing ? A bush of roses, a lily bulb waiting to bloom . . I can't believe it I'm not . He could he could I said these things to Ben . and Ben said, 'But he loved her'. . . and I said, 'What of that ? ' Is loving somebody a reason to kill ? . and Ben said 'How old are thee ? ' Mary My father must have loved my mother very much Mother . . . I suppose . . . . I . . I mean, I suppose we are not old enough There must be an awful lot we don't know . . . . . I don't want to know . . . I don't want to grow up ! Mary .. You told me a story once . . about a secret garden . . No one but children could see . . . . and grownups never came . . The children were very happy . . It's a long time . . . . til we're grownups . . . We're going to be happy Nothing's ever going to happen to our garden No one's ever going to know . . . My father . . . . . hide . . . . You're awake ? . . Where were you when I arrived this afternoon ? I asked for you . . . no one knew . I was out of doors . . I came back as soon as I heard you were here Mrs. Medlock tells me you've spent much of the summer out of doors, I'm surprised The house gets stuffy But what do you do ? You can't run and play. . I watch the others Mary Lennox and the neighbour boy Where do you go ? Nowhere father . . just out of doors I'm . . . . taking you to Italy for the winter To Italy ? Just you and I . . I've been a wretched father . I shall try to do better We'll not come back to England for a long long time . . I don't want . . . . . . . I mean . . . Who's to look after the house ? . . and . . So I'm selling the house I've brought a gentleman up from London with me . . . If he likes the house, he'll buy it, I shall know in the morning Sell the house ? The gardens, everything ? Of course, why not ? You look at me so strangely, what's the matter Colin ? I don't want you to sell it ! This is absurd, you've always hated it. Why do you want to keep it now ? You can't sell it ! Oh stop this nonsense . . I'm trying to help you I won't leave it I won't !! Colin, Colin I . . I'd die I'd die, you can't sell it you can't you can't you can't !!! Stop it !!! Oh Colin, my son . . . We'll go away, we'll rid ourselves of this place and never come back ! I've shared my curse with you . . and I can no . more . cure your poor body than you can cure my mind But I swear to you, I swear before God, we will be happy together While there's still time . . I owe you everything a father . . can owe a son We'll be very happy Papa Thank you We'll leave for Italy in a few days But I couldn't help wondering while I was poking about . . . . what stories these old country houses could tell Century after century . . . . generation after generation . . . . . what tragedies . . what comedies they've seen . . Would you say you've poked about sufficiently ? Forgive me . . I'm a man with a great deal of money and no background whatsoever . . so that makes me a romantic. Yes, I think I've poked about sufficiently Shall we go in ? Thank you I'll give you my cheque . . our lawyers in town will arrange the balance and the transfer Oh thank you It's understood however that the cheque will be binding ? It's understood . . . If you had children . you wouldn't want to part with those gardens I have a son, he's crippled. . he can't walk Oh . . . . I'm sorry to hear that I'll take the cheque . . . What about the garden that's locked up ? You may with it, whatever you like I hardly dared to ask . . but I hoped you might have an outside ghost or something ? You're a man of old family, you lock up your garden just to protect your valuable plants I'm a business man and . . I want a . . secret garden and ghosts If you actually expect valuable plants. . . you'll be disappointed The garden has been locked for ten years. . No one has been in it, in that time It's inhabited in all probability by weeds I beg your pardon ? Why it's as beautifully kept a garden as I've ever seen What ? You saw it ? Of course . . there was a ladder . . I climbed the ladder You're lying . . . I don't know what's the matter with you Mr. Craven . . . but it's your garden . . . . . and I tell you it's magnificent ! I tell you . Nobody has been in it . for ten years ! Nobody's been in it for ten years . . . . . . . . Ben Weatherstaff Sir ! Get me Ben Weatherstaff ! He's somewhere in the grounds Yes Sir Never mind, that's all I'm selling the house Mr. Gromlet to escape if possible . . the temptation of madness It would seem that the Gods have arranged for me . . one last chance I have resisted as long as I can Mr. Craven Sir Get away ! You must not go in there . . Get away or I'll kill you ! The raven Dickon . . I think it's Ben . . . Lock the gate ! You !! Please please Mr. Craven, we were just leaving . Get away from me !! You can't do it again ! Please . . please Mr. Craven ! Colin ! Colin ? Father . It's our garden . . . . . . . please ! . . Please don't hurt our garden . . Papa ! oh . . . Colin . . .
