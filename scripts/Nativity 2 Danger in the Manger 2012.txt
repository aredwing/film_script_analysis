I was starting a new job at a new school and having my very first baby. Well, that's what Christmas is all about. Family. The only problem was, I didn't get on with my family. Especially my twin brother Roderick. But I wasn't going to let that spoil things. No. Hi! No, I just had a feeling... - Want to put this on the tree? - ...this was going to be the best Christmas ever. Higher. And back. No... Ooh! Ohh! - Donald, are you all right? - Yeah. I'm just a bit stuck. - I love Christmas. - Yeah. I'm glad that we're here and I'm glad that we've moved away. Yeah. What was the Headmistress like? She seemed good. Seemed like she really knew what she was doing. - Did you meet anybody else there? - No, she didn't want me to. No, from what she said, the staff are fantastic. Sounds like the perfect school. Argh! Argh! Yargh! Mrs Bevan? Mr Lambert. Supply teacher. - Mr Lambert. - Lambert. Oh, I'm so pleased to see you and so grateful. This is what it's like when you have a baby. Whoa! And our last teacher, Mr Maddens, he had to go to America, so we lost him unfortunately, but you're going to love Mr Poppy. Mr Whippy Poo! Enthusiastic, energetic. - Ready? - Yes. Fire! Ohh! Don't throw the eggs. Everybody, give your eggs to me. Um... So your class is just down here. They're great kids. They're lively, feisty. What do you think? Yes! Who put you up to this? Mr Poppy. - Mr Poppy! Good morning, boys and girls. Good morning, Mr Shakespeare. Who will win a Song for Christmas? This Christmas, Coventry's own Oakmoor School will be shining a light on our city at the prestigious A Song for Christmas Contest. A Song for Christmas is open to any school soloist or Glee Club up to the age of 18. I'm only six. We tick the box. Now, it's taking place at Llawen Castle in Wales. The competition will be hosted by singing sensation... Angel Matthews. I love Angel Matthews. She's the one that sung... And competing alongside Oakmoor School will be St Cuthbert's Choir and they're from London and they're led by a renowned conductor, Roderick Peterson. - Never heard of him. - He's a sensational young talent and, um, he's going to have a top-notch choir, so we've really got to come up with it, OK? The winning song will win... - 10,000! - WOW! And could even become a Christmas No. 1. Final closing date for entries... is tomorrow. Right, OK, my little mystic monkeys, I want you to go through the school, tell everyone we are holding secret Song for Christmas auditions. And if anybody comes up to you and asks you, you need to say... "What Song for Christmas?" What Song for Christmas? Yes! Jingle Bells Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open Sleigh Sleigh, hey! We're going to win A Song for Christmas Because it's Christmas and it's snowing outside It is cold But I don't care Because we're wrapped up, even warmer inside - You're going to go through to boot camp! - Yay!

I don't care if you know my name I will sing a song for you I don't care I don't know how to say hello And I'm made of yellow Good morning, boys and girls. Good morning, Mrs Bevan. Well, you're all looking very sparkly today, aren't you, on this lovely sunny morning. And that's because we're on the countdown to... Christmas! Now, some of you are very excited about a competition that I've heard about that's happening in Wales. Well, children, I have to tell you that St Bernadette's will not be going. Ohhh! The thing is, we simply don't have the money, the talent or the time. But to make up for it, we are going on a special visit to see Father Christmas. Isn't that exciting? Away In A Manger Away in a manger... Oh, my goodness me. Please tell me this is a joke, Auntie Pat. What do you mean? - You're not going to Song for Christmas. - Well, you're not. Well, I've already been doing auditions for the children, OK? Desmond, not again. You promised me you wouldn't do anything unless we spoke about it first. Please, come and sit down. I didn't want to have to do this, Auntie Pat, but I would like to speak to your supervisor, please. - What? - Yes. Like to speak to your... manager. - Get them in. - Desmond! Do you understand that you're only here because... ...You are my nephew? You're not even a qualified teacher. You can barely read and write! So if we find a proper teacher, we can go, right? Every time I find anybody, you do something so appalling that they leave. It is not happening. Do you understand that? N- O, no, Desmond. Right, you are not my best friend, Auntie Pat. All right? And you are not in my team any more. As of this day I am freezing you out. Plaaa! We three Kings of Orient are Bearing gifts, we traverse afar Field and fountain, moor and mountain Following yonder star Oh, lovely finish. Just love it. I can see the star. I think maybe you're a star. The stars in the bright sky Look down where he lay This is a national competition. This is the gateway to stardom! God rest ye merry gentlemen Let nothing you dismay For Jesus Christ our Saviour was born on Christmas Day To save us all from Satan's power When we were gone astray - There it is. Oh tidings of... That's Christmas for you. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Go and sit down! With th'angelic host proclaim Christ is born in Bethlehem Hark! the herald angels sing Glory to the newborn King O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Thy leaves are so unchanging Nice try, Ravi. OK. Mrs Bevan has done a complete freak-out on me. She pulled the plug. She's just... ...on everything. Teachers are losers. Yeah, teachers are losers and what are we? Winners. Well, that's a bit rubbish. We've got to turn it round. We've got to do something. - We're going to turn it round big-time. - We're going to turn it round big-time. Do we need a teacher? No! Do we believe in this class? Yes! Who believes we can win - Song for Christmas? - Me! Who wants to go and see Father Christmas? - Me! - Well, come on, then. Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin flew away Michael Finlay lost his willy on the motorway, hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells 'Scuse me, can I help you? Yeah, I'm just here to see Mrs Bevan. - Yeah, what about? - I'm Donald Peterson. I'm the new Class Seven teacher. Hello. I actually can't understand what you're saying. - Um, what's your name, sorry? - What's your name, sorry? - Right. I tell you what I'm going to do. - I tell you what I'm going to do. - OK. - I'm going to count to 10 and if you're not out of that gate, we are going to freak you right out and take you down. Sorry, is that a threat? 10! Nine, eight, seven, - six... - OK, everyone. ...five, four, three, two, - one. - Charge him! Oh, no, I've got to see the Head teacher. - This is not funny. - This is... Take him down! I've got a letter. Mr Poppy! Stop it! Stop it! Was that man in charge of a class? Not in charge, no, no, no, no. We wouldn't put him in charge. He's an assistant. - That man is a Classroom Assistant? - That's right. - Does that not worry you? - Well, yes, and that's why we need you. We need discipline and focus and you're the man to give it to us. If you can work with him till Christmas, I'll make you Headmaster in January. - You can't do that. - I will. Jingle, merry, merry, merry, merry elves We've got many, many, many bells We're in the workshop all by ourselves It's Mr Shakespeare. Santa's little helpers, Santa's little elves We think of you and not ourselves We've got our toys lined up on our shelves Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas Elf Olaf is a guiding star He's the greatest elf by far You'll get a laptop, you'll get a car Merry, merry elfin Christmas Shake your bells if you love elves Shake your bells if you love elves Shake your bells if you love elves Merry, merry elfin Christmas Well done, everyone, absolutely marvellous. Hello, Mr Poppy. How wonderful to see you. Hello, boys and girls. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? Well, we're here practising for our Song for Christmas and I think we did very well. Don't you? Yes, Mr Shakespeare. We're going to be going to Song for Christmas. - You are? Oh, really? - Yes, really. This is a national, national competition. Yeah, and we're going to win it. But this is like Saturday night television live. Yeah, I know, and we're going to be on it. We're going to be on it and win it. - We're going to be on it and win it. - You're not, we are. - We're going to win. - We are. - Right, who's going to win it? - We are! I feel sorry for you, I really do. Not only are you poor and thick, you're actually taught, allegedly, by this man here. - Excuse me. - No, no... - Jess, stand there. - We need to see Father Christmas. - Come on, kids. - No. Thou shalt not pass. Don't be so ridiculous. Please. Don't you shout at me. - How dare you! - You... - Ha! - Rip my ears off, - I'll rip your head off! - Argh! Stupid man! Rip my head off? Agh! Right. Let's go. Let's just go. Licking my face. It's hideous. Come on, children. Stay away from him, please. Father Christmas, we've come to you because you are our only hope. Oh. We need you to help us grant our Christmas wish. We're having a nightmare, to be honest, aren't we, kids? We really want to go to Song for Christmas but, like, Auntie Pat won't let us because she's saying I'm not a proper teacher and saying we haven't the money to get a bus to get there. But it's at this castle in Wales and you can win, like, 10,000. Christmas No. 1, album. Everything will be sweet. We've got to make it happen. Nobody believes in us any more, Santa. Well, we're not very good singers. - Yes, you are. - We are. - No, we're not. - Santa, nobody likes us any more. Please help us win the Song for Christmas. I will try and make that wish come true. I will do that, Mr Poppy. Close your eyes and wish. I think that's a very good wish, that is. With all that effort, I think we might be able to get there. Thank you. Now, listen up, guys, OK? Do not mention Song for Christmas. What Song for Christmas? All for one and one for all! Mr Poppy. - OK? - Mm-hm. I feel like I've got an apology to make. I'm really sorry about what happened. It was basically a dare that got out of hand. - It was a dare? - Mm. - Who dared you? - One of the children basically dared me and I don't know if you know about dares but you've got to do the dare. If you don't do the dare it turns into a double dare, then triple, quadruple, and the last time that happened, we lost a child. - Right. - Just so you know, I've been with this class now for a couple of years. - No, I understand that. - You know, we're not really a class, - we're like a family. - Sure. I'm like the Dad of the family, they're like my children. We're willing to let you audition for role of Mum. OK, that's not how it's going to work. What we're going to do now is we're going to get the kids' coats off. You're going to hang your parka up, we're all going to come in here and get to know each other. How's that? - Hello, what's your name? - Sam. - Do you want to slip your hat off? - Sorry, this is a lucky hat. You can't take that off. She wears that in the bath, for dinner, in lessons. Mr Poppy, Mr Poppy, shh, shh. Sam. Whoa, she's betrayed the hat. It's just a hat, guys. OK, boys and girls, lovely to meet you all. My name is Mr Peterson and now I've got to get to know all of you. What's this class been working on? Yes. Yeah, we've been doing a song, writing for Song for Christmas. What Song for Christmas? - What? - What Song for Christmas? - What Song for Christmas? - What did you blurt that out for? - What is that? - It's a national competition. All the schools are entering it. It's nationwide. The only thing is, you've got to sign this to enter us because we need a proper teacher with a PGCD, whatever you've got. So if you put your teacher's email there, signature, we can get that in the post. - Why has no teacher signed this already? - Because Mrs Bevan doesn't want us to go. Mr Poppy, if Mrs Bevan has said no, then... - It's not far. It's just Wales. - Wales? Yeah, it's great. There's a castle. It's in a castle. Look, it's my first day here. I can't be signing forms, allowing you to take a class of children to Wales when the Head Teacher said no. - It'll put the school back on the map. - It'll put me out of a job. No, it won't. Please, Mr Peterson. If you put your name on there, then you're in the team. The family. - This is something you all want to do? - Yes! You got much to say about it? Do you want to do it? That's Tommy and he has not spoken since his dad left the home. But he can sing. He's got the most amazing singing voice in the world. What's the song like? Yes! Mr Peterson, I give you St Bernadette's! Christmas tinsel and jingle bells Presents beneath the tree Ho, ho, ho, ho Father Christmas and his little elves Making stuff for you and stuff for me You want your big Christmas Day You want your Santa and sleigh Don't forget about the baby who was born in the hay He was born in the hay Danger danger in the manger Don't give baby to a stranger Nasty Herod on his way, hide the baby in the hay Don't be a sheep, just be a King King, King, King Very good. Look, I thought you were all great and I think it's really exciting that you've got this singing club and it's great to see you doing your stuff but, um... What Mr Peterson is trying to say is it's good but we need a gimmick. - Anyone got any ideas? - That's not... Have smoke coming up from the stage. Baby Jesus could come up. Yeah, we can get a baby. Yes. Who's got a baby? Nobody's bringing any baby brothers or sisters or nephews or nieces into school. I think what Mr Peterson is trying to say is tomorrow what we should be doing is a show and tell where you each bring your baby brothers and sisters in. That's very much the opposite of what Mr Peterson is trying to say. Tomorrow we'll be in class. We'll be doing some maths, some literacy. This is all great and it's very good fun. And some of you are very talented. But there is no bringing babies to school tomorrow. Is that understood? Oh, excuse me! That is my private cupboard, thank you. Who's that man? That's Mr Maddens. - And he's...? - He used to be a teacher here. - Ah. - Yeah. - Right. - And you could take a few tips from him, if you like, because he's the sort of man that would have been up for babies being in plays and he's the sort of man that would have built the costumes and created the thing. Desmond, you do know there's no way we can enter this competition? - What do you mean? - Stop raising the kids' expectations that they're going to win prizes and be the Christmas No. 1. It's not fair. Excuse me, Mr Peterson, but maybe you should take a good hard look at this man. Look in his eyes. He was the greatest teacher we ever had. Right. Well, he's not here any more, is he? No. He abandoned us. Like you'll probably abandon us in a couple of weeks' time when you decide that we're not good enough for you. Mr Poppy, I'm here for the long haul. I'm here to make these kids' lives better. Mm. Do you fancy maybe going for a sausage sizzler at the park? - We always used to do that. - Oh, I've got to get back. My wife's quite pregnant. I should really shoot home. But maybe another night, yeah. I'd really like that. OK. OK? We good? Are we agreed? Yep. See you in the morning. - Oh, Mr Peterson. - Oh, hi, Lucy. Oh, hello. Hi, Donald. - How are you settling in? - Not bad. Yeah. Good. It's great news about the... the Song For Christmas. Oh. You know about that? Oh, Mr Poppy's told me. Right. Well, I'm afraid I had to put a stop to it. I thought there were baby auditions this morning. No, no, we cancelled them. - Really? - Didn't we? - Did you? - Did we? Jingle Bells Has he got any special skills? Brilliant! Brilliant! Is he any good on a skateboard? No, no, no. No, no. You're not putting a baby on a skateboard. And then maybe a little... And then jump off... .. and into the crib. Would you mind maybe if we were to put a little beard on her? No. What about me covering the baby in meat? Why would baby Jesus be covered in meat? Well, Lady Gaga covers herself in meat. She wasn't the son of God. Has she got any tricks, little party pieces? We can train the babies up. You can't train babies. - We can send the baby to boot camp. - We're not going to this competition. We're going to go to the competition and win it. Yeah! Ah! - Does he know the way to Wales? - Know your way to Wales? I think he said yes. He's just a bit tired. .. open sleigh Absolutely unbelievable! At last. Where've you been? I think he's actually certifiably insane. I mean, he dresses like a lunatic. And the nonsense that comes out of his mouth. This competition... Today, 25 babies show up. We're not going to Song For Christmas like I've said 250 times already. - "No, you haven't. " - Yes, I have. - "You never told me. " - Yes, I did. - "You promised. " - I never promised. Don. You're just insane! Things are about to get worse. - How can they possibly... Who's that? - It's your father. What? He phoned a couple of hours ago. He wants to come and spend Christmas with us. - He can't come here. - Well, he is. - For Christmas? - Yes. Why is he coming here? Go and answer the door. I don't want him shouting at us. Answer it! - At last! - Hi, Dad. What did you think I was? A bunch of carol singers? - Hold on. Madge, Madge... - Nice surprise. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you knew. Yes. For the next two weeks, I'll be away. That's right. Absolutely everything. Just cancel the lot. That's it. Good. Thank you. Just one minute. Donald. Coat. Thank you. - Hi, Dad. - Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, I have had the journey from hell. Oh, sorry to hear that. Sit, Donald. So, new house. New town. New job. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm not going to beat about the bush. Your job, a primary school teacher, is leading you nowhere. How much a year do you get paid? This job isn't about the money. That's not... Everything is about the money, Donald. Do you know what your brother has gone on to do? Oh, I know... Are you aware, frankly, of what that boy has achieved already? And what he's going to achieve. Your brother is going to be on TV tomorrow night in A Song For Christmas. - A Song For Christmas? - Yes. A competition. Which he undoubtedly will win. Roderick's choir is the best in the country. I've actually never said this to anybody but when I looked at you both in that cot, when you were both born, I could see this little halo above you and I thought to myself, "You're going to be the one. You're going to be the one to take on the mantle. The Peterson mantle. And go on and achieve. " And somehow a cloud came over you. And it shone on the other child. And that child took off. I'm very proud of your brother. I really am. I make no bones of it. I am disappointed in you. And have been for quite some time. Roderick this, Roderick that. "Isn't Roderick amazing? Look at his amazing job. " Look at this. Everyone says we look alike. I don't think we look at all like each other. No, I don't think you look like each other either. I'm certainly not entering that competition now. I'm really sorry to call you here so early but Operation Song For Christmas is underway. The most important thing is the guys staying behind to cover... you've got to make sure that Mrs Bevan thinks the lessons are still running. All for one and one for all! Operation Song For Christmas is go! Go, go! - Mr Poppy? - Come on, jump aboard. - What's this? - We've got to go, otherwise Mrs Bevan'll turn up and we won't get away. - I told you, we are not going to Wales. - Get on the bus! No, no! Back in the school. Get back in the school right now. You need to calm down, Mr Peterson. It's not just you you're affecting, it's the baby. - I... - Come on! Mr Poppy... Agh! Right, come on. Back inside, come on. Back inside the school. Mr Peterson, this is for your own good. Bundle! Mr Poppy! Scream if you want to go faster! Mr Poppy, stop this bus!

Right, Mr Poppy, stop the bus. - No! - Stop the bus right now. - Why? - OK, I'm calling the school. I'm not going to turn the bus... - Bob. - No, no, no. Give me that back. Give me that back! That's my phone! That... My... - That is not good. - Just calm down, Mr Peterson. Listen, have you any idea how serious this is? Look at it. Look at this. Do you want to go to Song For Christmas? Yeah! My wife is at home, pregnant, with a baby that could arrive any second and I have no phone, no way of getting in touch. Please turn this bus around. Just tell her in the morning you had a sleepover. Why would I have a sleepover? Mr Maddens used to have sleepovers at mine. I'm a grown man. Grown men don't have sleepovers. Yes, they do. And midnight feasts. Oh. yeah! Mr Poppy, my brother is entering this competition. - You've got a brother? - Yeah. Now, my brother is a world-class classical composer and conductor. You really want to break little Pixie's heart? She's just lost her grandma. This Song For Christmas means everything to her. How is this going to help? Because it'll just turn all her frowns upside down. Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go Off to sunny Wales - Now, everyone, I think we're going to be coming close through a little village called Llawen. And if you'll just come in you'll see... Isn't that St Bernadette's, sir? Wow. Did you see that cool bus, sir? Turn away, turn away. We've got the best bus. We've got the best bus in show business. How much... How much would it cost me to get you to untie me? 20? 50? 60. That's my final offer. Quick, untie me. Get me out of this chair. All right, I'll get you out but I need some money. - I haven't got any. - He told me he's got 60. - Well, get it off him. - Lucy. - Search him. - No, no. - Frisk him. - Lucy. - Look in his back pocket. - This is theft. Mr Poppy! Mrs Bevan. Come in, Miss Rye. - Just a quick word. - Yes. Most of Mr Peterson's class appear not to have turned up for lunch. Everything's all right in there. Ah, naughty boy. What are you doing standing out here, Malcolm? He doesn't want anyone in today. Mr Peterson doesn't want anyone in. Step... Just step aside. - He doesn't... - Thank you, Malcolm. Mason, stop it. Ah, Mr Peterson, where are you? Mr Poppy. Where's Mr Pet... Oh! Ah! Oh! Where's Mr Peterson? They went to Song For Christmas. What Song For Christmas? I need a wee, Mr Shakespeare. Me too! We'll find a place to stop and have a wee-wee. Mr Shakespeare, I really need a poo. Well, hold it in, hold it in. Don't do it on the bus. It's just down there. Anywhere by the hedge there. That's it. Good. Good, good. No, anywhere. It doesn't matter. Do it in the road. That's it, are you all right? That's it, keep going. Just come this way. See that? Just turn it round. Turn it right round.

Wait! Mr Shakespeare! Look, I can see a sign for the castle. There's a little girl. Who is that? Hold on. I'm going to go and find out what she... - Who are you? - Elena. Where's Mr Shakespeare and the rest of Oakmoor? He's gone to Song For Christmas. What, and they left you here? He just went off without me. - How do I know you're telling the truth? - I always tell the truth. - Do you think I'm ugly? - Yes. That's not very nice. I was telling the truth. All right, let me just consult my team and then I'll be back to you with an answer. Wait a few minutes, please, caller. - Right, shall we let her on the bus? - Yeah. If she tricks us, though, we're going to freeze her out, yes? No... It's your lucky day, little Miss Shakespeare. On you jump- Everybody ready? We're off! The Man With The Bag Next stop, the castle. Woo-hoo! What was that? - Who's doing that? - Mr Poppy, I think there might be a baby. - What? - There's a baby in the back. Wow! It's a little baby... Aw, you're beautiful. He's got chubby cheeks. Hey! Hello, little baby. - Whose baby is this? - Not mine. Not mine. I don't even have a baby. I can't believe you've done this. I didn't do it. - This is really serious. - It's got nothing to do with me. Mr Peterson, it's a sign. - Yes! - It's a sign we're in a lot of trouble. Oh, look, there's a letter. What does it say? "Heard you needed a baby for Song For Christmas. I hope I'm all right for you. " You're more than all right. This baby's gorgeous. Oh, this is the best Christmas ever. You're right, Mr Peterson. it is the best Christmas ever. I was being sarcastic. You're going to help us win Song For Christmas. Yes, you are. Sure you know where you're going, Mr Poppy? I haven't seen a sign for miles. I know the way. It's fine. You just need to trust me. - Mr Poppy. - It's this way. - Mr Poppy. - It's this way! Mr Poppy, look! Sleigh Ride - Woo-hoo! - What's happening? We're swimming! - What do you mean? - It's a duck bus. How cool is this? Hey, kids, can anyone see any sharks? I get seasick. Hey, everybody, look for the castle. What's up now? The thing's stopped working. The needle on the thing. - What does that mean? - It's stopped. The needle's going down. It's not going. We're out of fuel? Well, if I just give it a bit more of a pump... You didn't fill it up with petrol! So we're stuck. Everybody ready? Off the bus. Mister Santa Oh! OK. Get your ukuleles. And your bags. It's all right, you can jump. Ooh, agh! All right, thank you, thank you, Mr Poppy. Right. Come on, everybody. You don't know it's over there. This is... brilliant! This is ridiculous. This is... Wait! How's the baby? Is the baby getting wet? The baby's fine. Whoa! Whoa! - Mr Poppy! - Whoa! Oh, it's a bit slippy. And watch out for the crocodiles. Yay! - Who's coming next? - Me! No, I know, I know. It's all right. It's all right. - Just breathe. - Mr Poppy. - Be back for you in a minute. - Mr Poppy! Oh, wow! - A donkey! - Aww. Hello, donkey. It's probably a sign, Mr Peterson. It's not a sign. It's a donkey. Well, it can help us carry Mary. We can't just take this donkey. It'll be somebody's property. Maybe it's trying to show us the way. Do you know the way? I think we've found ourselves a magic donkey. Really? - Ready, Mary? - Yeah. - Ready, everyone else? - Yeah. Come on, then, donkey. OK, let's go. Let's follow the magic talking donkey. Wow. Well, this is it, Oakmoorians. This is our destiny. This is the seat of kings and the site of many battles and we are going to win. We are going to win the Song For Christmas! All right. To the castle. Gracie, lead the line. Grace, stop. Stop, stop. Where's Elena? Where's Elena? Wh... Where? Where's Elena? When did you see her last? The toilets, sir. Was anybody looking to make sure she was getting back on the bus? We were too busy turning round the sign, sir. Shut up. Now, we mustn't let this distract us. Keep coming through. Come on. - Don't ever say that again. - Win, win, win when we sing, sing, sing. Win, win, win when we sing, sing, sing. Why are you stopping? Keep going. Why are you...? That's St Cuthbert's. Eyes front. It's Roderick. Angel Matthews, please make your way to the Great Hall. Thank you. Rhys, Angel is entering the Great Hall now. Over. Angel. Roderick, it's so wonderful to have you here. - Marvellous to see you. - Thank you so much. Thank you so much. To have a world-renowned conductor like you here is... It's beyond words. I am humbled. Me being here is not about the MBEs and the Grammys. I'm here as a contestant like anybody else. I know exactly what you're saying. - I want to make it plain. - Mm-hm. I don't expect any... favouring of our group, any sway that you might have over the judging panel. We expect to win by merit alone. Of course. Absolutely. I know you're a man of integrity. Miss Matthews. Um, sorry. Um... Rhys, could you please deal with the gentleman? A bit concerned I don't have a private space backstage. Would that be something we can sort out? - Could you show me? - Of course. It's just down here. Terrific. Thank you. So it's Oakmoor Primary School. What was your name, sir? I'm Shakespeare. Where's our dressing rooms and everything? - It'll be a shared space but... - A shared space? - Yes. - You're not providing us - Oakmoor school - with the chance that other schools are getting. - I'm merely trying to... - I've got your number, Poirot. Don't try it on with me. Come on. Let's go. Get away from all this fleece and fluff. I've never seen so much pink. You'll get static on you. Welcome to Song For Christmas. What's the name of your group? The Christmas Puddings. - Mr Peterson? - Yeah. I think baby's done a do-do. It really stinks. Look. Let's try that barn. Change the baby and get out of this rain. Go on. Let's go. - Wales? - A Song For Christmas? They are expecting them for a sound check, for which they are five hours late. When they get there, they will contact me immediately. You have a school party out there with two teachers and you have no references to where they are? What sort of ship are you running here? A very tight ship, Mr Peterson, until your son arrived. Sorry to disturb you, Mrs Bevan. Some parents are waiting in the hall. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for waiting. It appears that they are in transit at the moment. - To Wales. - Wales? I think you owe it to everybody in this room to give them a clear plan of what you intend to do. We're going to go down there. We're going to be there when they arrive. If they arrive. If they don't arrive, we'll go and search for them and we will not let one hair on their heads be harmed. I'm sorry. I don't want to add to any of the trouble. Yes? They might have a baby with them. - A baby. - My baby. Come on. Come on. You're a bit stinky, aren't you? I think you've done quite a lot of poo-poos. - All right? - I thought you might want to... - ...change him. - Really? You're going to have to do a lot of this. A lot of nappies and poo and wee. Sick. Yeah. OK. OK. Oh! Urrrgh! That is fierce. Whoa! Urgh! Tommy, can you throw your hat over? Oh! Sorry, Tommy. - Anyone got any scarves? - Check 'em over. Wrap it under. Are you really having a baby, Mr Peterson? - Yeah. - What are you having? A boy or a girl? - We don't know yet. - It could be an inbetweenie. - I don't think you get them. - Yes, you do, yeah. Who do you prefer? Mummy? Or Daddy? Mummy... or Daddy? Mum-my? Or Daddy? Whoa! Boats. Children! Baby's found some boats. Come over. We could use the boats to go down the stream. We're walking that way anyway. No, no, no, no. We'll never get the donkey in the boat. - Donkeys can fly. - What? - Donkeys can fly, can't they? - Yeah! - They'll say yes to anything you say. - No, they won't. - Try it. Go on. - Who wants to be eaten by a shark? No. - That's the exception. - I rest my case. That's the exception that proves the rule. They only say yes to things they want to do. They want to do this, so buckle up. Let's go! - We don't have a helmet for the baby. - Babies don't need helmets. - They do. - They don't. They bounce. - I fell off a table when I was a baby. - That explains quite a lot, frankly. - Let baby decide. - What? If baby claps, we go on the boats. No! No, no, no. Clap hands, Baby. That's cheating. It's not going to happen. Is it? - Thank you. - Trust me. Ahhhh! Hold on tight, Mr Peterson. Mr Peterson, you doughnut, try and keep up. There's a rock! Ah! No! Ah! Ah! Arrh! Hold on! Mr Poppy! - I don't like this. - Mr Peterson, it's brilliant. Yeah! Oh! Ah! Oh! Mr Poppy! Mr Peterson, what are you doing? Argh! Come on! Get me out! Get me out! Get me out! Why did you decide to jump in? We haven't got time for leisurely swims. I didn't jump in. I fell! Ah! We need to get going, Mr Peterson. We can't just dally about. I nearly drowned! You didn't drown. You're fine. You're just a bit wet. Shake it off like a dog. What have you done to me? What have you done? I nearly died in a river in the middle of nowhere because of you. Look! It's the donkey. Wow! How did you get here? How did you get here? How did you get here? - Ha, ha, ha. - We could have walked. Come on. Let's go to the castle. Hello, magic donkey. You flew here, didn't you? I told you he could fly! if you long to give to somebody else It's probably Christmas time - I'm soaking wet. - We'll find somewhere you can dry off. Calm down. - Mr Poppy, there's a cave. - Shall we go in? - Yes! - Why would we go in there? - Pixie, do you want to go in the cave? - Yeah! Come on, everybody. Let's go in the cave. Come on, then, you. Wow. It looks brilliant in here. Come on. I don't want to go in the cave either, Mr Peterson. No, I don't fancy it much. - Who wants to build a fire? - Me! - Are you scared of the dark? - Yes. - I'll do it if you will. - OK. - Deal? - Yeah. OK. You go first, then. Mother, Father Sister, brothers Let all that I have be yours What's yours is mine... Oh, wicked! What do you think, Mr Peterson? Very nice, yeah. - You still as frightened? - I wasn't frightened anyway. It was... I wanted to make sure it was all right. We've saved you some spaces. Dressing up in your Sunday best You're blessed and it's Christmas time Must be it's Christmas time - I'm sorry. - What for? I didn't realise that you were so frightened of water. My dad used to... He had this thing about toughening us up. One of his brilliant plans was he'd take us swimming every week and chuck us in the deep end. He had this real fixation with holding your breath for a long time. I think he thought the longer you could hold your breath, the more of a man you were. So he'd hold us under water. It worked for Roderick. Just made me scared. Dads are rubbish, aren't they? I never even got to meet mine. Oh, I'm sorry. When I was little, I used to pretend my dad was Father Christmas. One Christmas I stayed up all night hoping he was going to come but he never arrived. Like Tommy. We're both still waiting. You can have my dad if you like. I don't want him. Sssh. Sssh. I've got to speak to my wife. She doesn't know where we are. Mr Peterson. I really hope you don't mind but I kept this back for emergencies. You've had a phone in that bag this whole time? Yeah. I thought you might like to call your wife... I cannot believe you. There's no signal. Take the baby. Ssh. I'm going outside. Mr Poppy, is Father Christmas really your dad? I wish he was. But I don't think so. strumming When I was a boy I dreamed he'd find me Fall down from the sky To come and guide me Take me by the hand of life And show me all he's learned Everybody's got a dad but me It's my phone. - Sarah, it's me. - Donald? - Donald?! - Sarah? Donald? Oh, man. I need a dad to keep the demons from my door - I need a dad to stand beside me - Oh! Oh! - Hello? - Sarah! It's me. - Donald, I love you. - I love you. - I don't know if you can hear me. - That idiot! Still beating for The silly fool has finally got himself lost. - What does he think he's doing? - No idea. I still dream he'll find me Catch me if he can The ties still bind me Lead me down the rocky road And show me who I am Sarah! Sarah, please wait. Wait! Why? The whole of your life all you've ever done is put him down. No wonder he's panicking about how good a father he's going to be. You're the only example that he's had. You go back in there with Roderick, your favourite son. I'm going to find my husband. Everybody's got a dad but me Everybody's got a dad but me Right, Oakmoorians, this is it. What I'm looking - one or two of you to nip down the corridor and see if we can find out exactly what these other acts are about. Let's have a look. Ah. Snow Angels. This is Lloyd and his Snowballs. I heard them singing in the corridor. - What were they like? - He's as good as Justin Bieber. - Justin Beaver? Who's that? - He's a singer, Mr Shakespeare. Well, we must have a Justin Beaver. - Sam, you could do that, couldn't you? - Yes. - Do you know any of his moves? - No. But when he swishes his hair the girls go crazy. Swish your hair for me. Throw some shapes. That's it! You've got it. You can be our Justin Beaver. Excellent. Angels, Christmas Fairies, Puddings, Christmas Joy... We can beat all of them, can't we? We've got Justin Beaver. Now, let's sing our winning Christmas song. When you're poor at Christmas When you're down and... Hello. Hi. So great to meet you. Um, extraordinary to meet you. I can't believe I've got a poster on my wall. Would you vacate this room, please? Sorry? As soon as possible, please. The boys need to prepare. With all due respect, my children need to prepare as well. This is not your room. Would you leave, please? It's got a star on the door so it's obviously our room. - Come on. - No, Scott. Don't move. Sam, don't move. Crispin, can you alert security? I see. It's just one rule for one, and one rule for another. - Can you remove these, please? - All right, I'll take them. Sebastian, can... Can I just say. Yes, I've got your poster on my wall. You should have my poster on your wall. That Angel Matthews, the way she looked at me - or didn't look at me - I was disgusted. It's just too much. All my life I've tried to do well. Tried to gain respect, conduct myself with dignity, behave impeccably, be an inspiration. - I'm Shakespeare. - Let the small man through, boys. I'm Gordon Shakespeare. With the emphasis on the Shakespeare. We've got Justin Beaver in our team, don't you worry. Ignore the silly little man. OK, boys, it's time. Inhale success. Exhale doubt. Inhale. Hold that breath. Hold... that... breath. Sound check, sound check, sound check. One, two, three. One two, three. Name's Angel Matthews. That normally gets a big laugh. Of course, everybody does know who I am. Oh, holy night While stars are brightly shining She just won't shut up. How long's this going on for? Little wave and off. Angel has left the stage. Thank you. We're just going to run through our number. No photography in the auditorium, please. Not during our rehearsal. Hear the good news Sent from on high Glory to God A new king is nigh We celebrate the coming of a baby boy We celebrate a light across the world Rejoice, rejoice, a saviour born to hear our song To right the wrongs A joy across the world Joy of joy r Joy of joy! King of kings King of kings! Peace and joy Peace and joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Yeah. Shut up. Shut up. Stop it. We're ready for your group to do your sound check. Thank you. My team, come on. Boys, girls, Grace, some on. Jessica. When you're poor at Christmas When you're down and out When you've no food left to eat And you've no shoes on your feet And there's nothing in your sack, nothing and nowt There's no magic at Christmas... - It's very musical theatre, isn't it? - Oh, in the worst possible sense. - Lowest common denominator. - Derivative, yeah. The audiences love this kind of thing. Really? Christmas ain't for paupers Not for scum like us No nice presents to unwrap Just a bin bag full of rubbish And a big spot on your chin oozing with pus Happy Christmas! Christmas comes but once a year, but not for these boys and girls, I fear. Not for them are those Christmas pies. Christmas is... a pack of lies! Ha! Where is Christmas? Hiding underneath the tree? But this kind of... sentimentality... ...it's rather rewarded, is it? A little boy in a hat and glasses, singing his little heart out. That's what wins prizes, I'm afraid. Ah. Could it be that Christmas has abandoned me? Cold and hungry, cold and hungry Cold and hungry, cold and hungry Cold and hungry, cold and hungry Merry Christmas. Solo like that could really win you the competition, Roderick. Really? And they're definitely on after us in the running order, yes? Yes, that's right. They are. Interesting. Mr Peterson, it could go... I'll just stop here for five minutes. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are we stopping? We've got to go. Listen. We need to properly talk about what we do next. - What do you mean? - These children are cold and tired. - The children are fine. - It'll be very dark very soon. And then we'll be stuck. Jessie and Pixie are passing out. - Yeah. - Jessie and Pixie are my children. - I know all about them! - Mr Poppy, they are not your children. You're a classroom assistant and you're not a very good classroom assistant because you've led these children to the middle of nowhere and now what? This is not a great big adventure. This is serious and we're in trouble. I'd like to think that you were gonna help us get out of here. But, frankly, so far I've seen nothing but irresponsibility. So grow up, stop behaving like a child, and help me to sort this out. Do you know who you sound like, Mr Peterson? Your dad. That is... I don't think I'll ever get a best friend. I'll be your best friend. But you'll just leave, like everyone else. You'll leave school and move on. I need a friend I can be with forever. A forever friend. I'll be your friend forever. - Really? - Yep. Your best friend. What's that, Mr Peterson? Oh, it's just a little thing my mummy gave me, a long time ago. That's my brother. We're twins. He's got the other half. Well, at least he used to. When you put it together, it makes a heart. But we don't really see each other any more, me and my brother. No. Did you have an argument like you just did with Mr Poppy? Not really an argument. We were just... ...very different types of people. I think you should say sorry to Mr Poppy. Yeah, maybe I should. I'm not very good at saying sorry. Come on, Mr Peterson. Oh, all right. Oh, shh. He's coming. - I'm not speaking to him. - OK. I'm gonna do all my speaking through you. Pixie has convinced me that perhaps I snapped a little, and I've come to apologise. Tell Mr Peterson I've just had about enough of him making promises and then breaking them. Mr Poppy's had enough of you promising promises and breaking promises. It's not exactly what I said, but it'll do. Pixie, can you convince Mr Poppy that I'm genuinely sorry? Mr Peterson says that he's convenuinely sorry. Jessie, can you ask Mr Poppy where the baby is? - Cleo, have you got the baby? - Yeah, but I gave it to Sadie. - Sadie, have you got the baby. - I gave it to Elena. - Who's got the baby? - Where is the baby? - Where's the baby? - We can't have lost the baby. Baby! Mr Peterson, I'm really, really sorry. I should never have taken the class, escaped from school, and got to... Mr Poppy. That's not helping. Ba-by! - Baby! - Ba-by! Hey, Louise. You had us scared to death. Did you bring this baby today? I just thought she'd like to be in the Song For Christmas. Oh, Louise. Mr Peterson! Hey, look. - Look, we've found her. - He's found the baby! That's too high! Goodness sakes! Shh. Mr Poppy. - We're in this mountain range here, yeah? - Yeah. - The castle is just over that mountain. - Just over there. - Well, we can't climb that mountain. - Yes, we can. Isn't there a way round the side? We haven't got time to go around the side, Mr Peterson. We're gonna have to go over. Yes, we can climb the mountain If we all share the load Yes we can reach the summit at the end of the road If we lift our hearts to heaven And reach out for the stars Yes, we can climb the mountain Cos the mountain is ours Let the white winter weather Try and hinder our climb Yes, we can climb the mountain Because it's Christmas time It's Christmas time I can see the castle! Whoa. Right, come on. Let's get back from the edge. Stay back, everyone. We've got to turn back. We've got to go back the way we came. - We can't go back. - Well, we can't fly off that. - We've got to get to Song For Christmas. - We can't fly off the cliff! So we're not going to Song For Christmas? - Please, Mr Peterson. - We can't... We can't fly. I'm sorry. - Please, Mr Peterson. - Look... if you've got a way to get down this cliff, we can talk about it. It's not about us having a way, is it, Mr Peterson? You don't believe in any way we do, because you're always down on everything I suggest. - OK. Tell me how we're gonna do it. - I've got a rope, actually. Look, do you really believe we can suspend 14 children, a baby and a donkey off the side of this mountain? The problem is, Mr Peterson, is you don't believe we can. - Yes, we can, Mr Peterson. - Yes, we can, Mr Peterson. - Yes, we can, Mr Peterson. - Yes, we can, Mr Peterson. - Yes, we can, Mr Peterson. - Yes, we can, Mr Peterson. Yes, we can, Mr Peterson. Tommy! Brilliant! - Do you believe, Mr Peterson? - Not really. - Oh! - But I'm willing to give it a go. - Don't push your luck. - Get the rope! - You're fine. - This is awesome! Don't look down! That's it. - Hold on to the rope. That's it. - Whoa! Hold on. Steady. Steady. Are you all right, Bill? Careful. Careful! Are you all right, Lucy? - Get the rope. - Yeah, I've got it. No! Whoa! Don't let go! Concentrate on the rope! - I'm communicating with the donkey. - It's heavy! - Go, Tommy. - Steady. - You're fine. - My whole strength. That's all I've got. - Well, hold it tight. I'm losing grip. - I'm holding it tight. Whoa! Whoa! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy, are you OK? Just hold on. - Is everyone all right. - Yes. - Tommy! - Just... Just stay there. You're fine. Keep looking up. You have to go down there, Mr Peterson. - I can't go down there. - You have to go down. - Well, why can't you do it? - Because you're the teacher. This is your moment, Mr Peterson. You've got to go down there. I'll spot you. I'll hold the rope. All right. All right, tie me off. Come on. - Tommy! - Everything's gonna be fine. You can do it, Mr Peterson. All right? Mr Peterson's coming down. Slowly. Slowly. Tommy, I'm nearly with you. Tommy. It's gonna be all right. Hang on in there. OK, a bit lower. That's it. OK. Reach out. Take my hand. Take my hand. That's it. I've got you. OK, I've got you. I've got you. You're not gonna fall. You're gonna be OK. All right? I've got you. I've got him! What's that? Get their attention! It's a helicopter. It's gonna be all right, Tommy. You're gonna be all right. There they are! Straight down there! We need to put a line down. Hold on! Just hold on! - Sarah! - Donald! My wife! That's my wife! I love you! I love you too! Grab hold! You're gonna have to trust me and come with me. Here it comes. One... two... three... go! Grab hold! Woo-hoo! Fly! Mr Poppy, can I come down now, please? I love you, Mr Peterson! We did it! Whoo! Right... to the castle! And now please welcome to the stage the voice of an angel- Miss Angel Matthews! Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Welcome to Castle Llawen and the event of the year - A Song For Christmas. - Stay close. Good evening. - Hi, there. I need to speak to St Bernadette's. I believe them to be here and I believe there to be 14 abducted children and a baby. - I'm afraid they're not here. - I must look. - Excuse me. - I can't let you through, madam. - You have to let me through. - Unless you're registered... This is a matter for the police unless you move. Where's your tie? Smarten yourself up. I didn't bring a tie, but I can't let you through, madam... This year, as every year, we're looking for that special song that embodies the spirit of Christmas. I don't need to remind you of what the prizes are. They are phenomenal. 10,000. A chance to record a record with United World Music and also a shot at the Christmas number one - and you can't put a price on that. I know, cos I've had one. And a number seven the next year.

Christmas is for crackers on the Christmas tree Christmas is for kisses that you give to me Christmas is the footprints in the fluffy snow Christmas is the hanging of the mistletoe... - Mr Peterson? - Yeah? You know that feeling when you're really looking forward to something and it finally happens and you feel a little tiny bit sick? Mr Poppy, don't get cold feet now. Not after everything we've been through. We're here. We've made it. It's a feeling you can't explain Walking off your dinner down a frosty lane Singing a carol in the silent night And back to stuff your super-sizing appetite... - We're here for Song For Christmas. - St Bernadette's. You've missed registration. The show has begun. - The show can only just have begun. - Let us in! We really wanna win Song For Christmas.

Can I help you? Christmas is a time when we all start to think about the real meaning of Advent. Chocolates on the calendar. Last-minute shopping on the internet. Little boys and girls looking out of the window, wondering if Santa's going to bring them that toy they've been wanting all year round. So now, without further ado... Bring it up, bring it up. ...I would like to introduce to you Shane and the Calendar Girls singing Counting Down For Christmas. You can keep your peace on Earth. You can keep your holy birth. Keep your frankincense and myrrh. Christmas cheer... what's that worth? I want something I can use. Designer clothes or groovy shoes. I want diamonds big and rough. All I want is Christmas stuff Counting down to Christmas every day 24 windows to go Hoping that we're going to get stuff, ho,ho,ho Holding out for Santa, ho, ho, ho Counting down to Christmas all the way Feeling kind of glad I'm alive Waiting for my stuff to arrive Hope I get a fast car I can drive You can keep your peace on Earth You can keep your holy birth Keep your frankincense and myrrh I want something with some worth I want diamonds big and rough Never stop, it's not enough All I want for Christmas Is Christmas stuff Yeah, yeah Oh, oh Merry Christmas, everybody. Oh, that was wonderful. Well done. That's lovely. Aw. Well, no-one likes a show-off, do they? So, it is with great pleasure and humility that I introduce to you a choir that is in my opinion the best choir on the stage tonight. St Cuthbert's. They are singing Peace And Joy. Enjoy. Hear the good news Sent from on high Glory to God A new king is nigh We celebrate with peace and joy The coming of a baby boy We celebrate A light across the world Rejoice, rejoice, our hearts are strong A saviour born to hear our song To right the rights of all that's wrong A joy across the world Joy of joy King of kings Peace and joy Peace and joy Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Where is Christmas? Hiding underneath the tree? - That's my song. That... That's... Christmas is coming to everyone but me Where is Christmas? Where is she? Can it be that Christmas has abandoned me? Joy of joy Joy of joy King of kings King of kings Peace and joy Peace and joy Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! Wow, wow, wow! Or in other words, game over. Roderick Peterson OBE. Mr Shakespeare! Mr Shakespeare! Mr Poppy, they've stolen my song! St Cuthbert's locked us in here! Look, we can't get out. Could you let us out? So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce the next act. Though I'm not sure there's much point in them coming out on stage after that. Stay in your dressing rooms. No, I'm only joking. All the way from Coventry, it's St Bernadette's. I'm sorry. Actually, they have been disqualified. You've been disqualified. How did that happen? Um, it's Oakmoor Choir, singing A Dickens Christmas. Follow that! You can be Oakmoor. Pretend to be us. Take out place. Just go on there. Just beat that Roderick! Hideous man. Yeah, we'll beat him. Push us on. Come on, guys. It's Shakespeare's Globe! Yes! Used to be afraid of my own shadow Used to think I'd never make the grade Too scared to even dream the dream Unsure of everything it means But now my hopes are high, my life has changed So bring on all your distant horizons Make your climb just as steep as the skies Yes, we can climb the mountain if we all share the load Yes, we can reach the summit at the end of the road If we lift our hearts to heaven And reach out for the stars Yes, we can climb the mountain cos the mountain is ours The mountain is ours Yes, we can, I'm sure we can Never had too much belief in Christmas Never had a Christmas wish come true Never quite believed in why a baby born into a sty Should have a thing to do with me or you But now I feel the magic around me And the stars shining down light the way Yes, we can feel the loving and the hope on the way Yes, we can keep on climbing till the end of the day Let the white winter weather try and hinder our climb Yes, we can climb the mountain because it's Christmas time It's Christmas time This is our last Christmas together We're going to make it last for ever But don't forget about the baby who was born in the hay He was born in the hay You want your big Christmas Day You want your Santa and sleigh But don't forget about the baby who was born in the hay He was born in the hay Come on, Oakmoor, unzip the back. One, two, three, four! Christmas tinsel and jingle bells Presents beneath the tree Oh, oh, oh, oh Father Christmas and his little elves Making stuff for you and stuff for me Christmas magic, it wouldn't exist A reindeer in the snow, no,no,no,no if Angel Gaby hadn't tried to resist On something only he could know You want your big Christmas Day You want your Santa and sleigh But don't forget about the baby who was born in the hay He was born in the hay Danger danger in the manger Don't give baby to a stranger Nasty Herod on his way, hide the baby in the hay Don't be a sheep, just be a King You want your big Christmas Day You want your Santa and sleigh But don't forget about the baby who was born in the hay He was born in the hay He was born in the hay He was born in the... He was born in the hay I've got it! I've got it! Congratulations! Congratulations! - Yay! Oh, baby! - You were amazing! - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! - All right. Brilliant, wasn't it! For the last few hours, we've been trying to find you, you stupid boy. We did an encore. I don't know if you saw that, big man. - But we did an encore out there. - Who is this village idiot? This is Mr Poppy, and he's the one who wrote the song. Oh, really? Is that what you call it? Which one? The first or the second? Cos we did two. Yeah, we did... We're still going to win the competition. You know what? Oh, I'm sure you are gonna win. And I hope you take the prize and I hope you shove it up your nose! We went out there and had fun! And that might not be important to you, Roderick, and it might not add up to all your OBEs, and all your reviews in newspapers, and all your international prizes, but having fun is pretty blooming important! There is no need to be so patronising to your brother. Shut up! How dare you speak to your father like that?! I dare! I dare to tell you to shut up! And you! - Both of you. - Can I have a go? - Yeah, go on. - Shut up! - And you shut up. - I don't need you any more. I've got a proper family now. Look. And a baby on the way. This is my family. Yeah. Yeah. And he's my family. This... This stupid, crazy man dressed like a star who talks nonsense and drives buses that swim and gets us stranded on mountains and nearly drowns me in a river. He, in one day, has been more of a brother to me than you have ever been! Can you please keep your voices down! Oh, you can shut up, too! Roderick, what's going on here? Angel, you'll have to call security. They have been disqualified and are refusing to leave. - Right, right. Rhys, Rhys. - No! No! Jahh! Don't bother calling security. We're leaving, very happily, with dignity and our heads held high. Good night, good luck, merry Christmas, thank you very much. As of now, you are officially banned from the building. If you are found, you will be arrested. Get out of the way! Can I just say lam a huge fan of your work. - Can I get an autograph? - Go on, then. Have you got a pen? - Have you got a pen? - Poppy! I can post it. Cheer up, it's Christmas! I'm gonna need a jab. OK, so what an evening it's been, ladies and gentlemen. What an evening. But now the moment of truth. It's make-your-mind-up-time, judges. So while they come to the final - and what some people feel foregone - conclusion, I'd like to share something with you. Tonight, something very special has happened here on the stage... ...and something very special has happened here... in my heart. And that's the spirit of Christmas. We love you, Angel! O, holy night The stars are brightly shining... - Oh! - You all right? - No, it's another one. - Really? Yes. Here we go. Good donkey. Good donkey. That's it. In sin and error pining Till he appeared And the soul felt its worth - A thrill of hope... - Follow me, everybody! The weary world rejoices As yonder breaks... - Look! A barn. A new and glorious morn Fall on your knees Breathe. Oh, hear the angel voices Oh, night Divine... Go on! Get in there! - Roll the sleeves up! - I can't do this. Watch off. - I'm going in. - No. - Fine. - No, you're not. Get back here. Divine Oh, night... - One, two, three... Push! That's it! Oh, here it comes. Here it comes. Of faith serenely beaming With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand O'er the world A star is sweetly gleaming... - What's wrong? - Something's happening. Now come the wise men From out the Orient land... - The baby's nearly there. Come on. - OK. Come on, you can do it. I believe in you. Lay thus lowly manger In all our trials Born to be our friends - Oh! He knows our need... There's your mummy. Our weakness is no stranger O, night divine The night when Christ was born O, night... Two of them? The night... - Come on in, Granddad. This is amazing. Amazing. Look, here's your granddad. I'm really proud of you, Donald. Really proud. And now comes the moment we've all been waiting for - to crown the winners... ...of A Song For Christmas. Rhys, I'm so excited. I can't wait. Right, thank you. And... .. the winners are... St Cuth... Oakmoor! That's right? Right, Oakmoor, ladies and gentlemen. Get out of the way! - It wasn't even our song, sir. - Shh. It doesn't matter. Shut up. We've won. Yay! I've won. Yes! I've won! I've won! Whoo! And so, on that magical night, under the stars, in a tumbledown barn, the miracle of Christmas happened to me. And, just as I'd hoped, it really was the best Christmas ever. Peace falls over the valley Hearts are lifted with love Joy falls into our lives like a star from above in the valley Everybody all over the world Are you feeling this feeling tonight? - Roddy. Donald. Well, it seems congratulations are in order. Yeah. Thank you. And you're an uncle. Yes. Yes, I am. Twin boys. Let's hope they get on a little better than we've managed. Yeah. It would be nice... ...if perhaps we could get the family together a little more often. Yeah. I'd like that. Mm. Good. Joy falls into our lives and makes everything right in this valley Everybody all over the world... Thanks. Merry Christmas. It's all right if the snow's coming down And the blizzards engulf every town Cos it's cold outside But Hawaii in my heart this Christmas This Christmas It's all right if the snow starts to fall And the chill wind descends on us all Cos it's cold outside But Hawaii in my heart this Christmas This Christmas It's cold outside But Hawaii in my heart tonight Merry Christmas. When Santa got stuck up the chimney Sorry. Who is it getting stuck up there? Shnamna? - Santa. - Santa! Go on, then. Sing it. When Santa got stuck up the chimney It's got... We're missing it, aren't we? Oh, silent night Holy night... - Stop it there. Yes, it's pathetic... in a very good way. Um, Pixie, what's your Christmas wish, Pixie? I wish that it would be Christmas every day. I'm a little snowflake We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas You can go and sit down. Why did the dog sit by the fire? I don't know. Why did the dog sit by the fire? Because he wanted to be a hot dog. I want you to be an elf. Think of an elf. Picture that elf. And then dance as that elf. Ding-dong merrily on high In heaven the bells are ringing Why... on... Why did the cow cross the road? I don't know. Why did the cow cross the road? To go to the moo-vies. - The what? - Moooo-vies. Back to the classrooms. Hang your head in shame. With th' angelic host proclaim Christ is born in Bethlehem Hark! The herald angels sing Glory to the newborn king Lewis, do you think that kind of singing is gonna win The Song For Christmas? - No, Mr Shakespeare. - Nor do I. Sit down. I do have a sad story but I don't have a song or a dance. We love sad stories. Sad stories are the things that inspire other things. Um, my mum came home from work. She went to my nanny's and then she found out that my nanny's dog died. Counting down to Christmas every day 24 windows to go Hoping that we're gonna get snow Holding out for Santa, ho, ho, ho Counting down to Christmas all the way Feeling kind of glad I'm alive Waiting for my stuff to arrive I hope I get a fast car I can drive You can keep your peace on Earth You can keep your holy birth Keep your frankincense and myrrh I want something with some worth I want diamonds big and rough Never stop, it's not enough All I want is Christmas stuff Oh, counting down to Christmas... Tis the season to be jolly, fa-la la-la-la... It's the most miserable "jolly" I've ever seen. Holding out for Santa, ho, ho, ho Counting down to Christmas all the way... Jingle bells, jingle bells Batman smells Santa got stuck up the chimney And then he lost his willy Hoo-hoo! It's a bit blue! You can keep your holy... All is calm All is bright Let's see your eyes. Round the virgin so... Yes, all right, sit down. I'll have to think about you. All I want for Christmas... Here we go. Christmas ain't for paupers. Christmas ain't for paupers. Now can you do it like a working class person? Christmas ain't for paupers. Brilliant! It's so accurate. You see, it's so authentic, that. Did you feel it? Twinkle, twinkle, little star How I wonder what you are Up above the world so high Like a... star in the sky Twinkle, twinkle, little star How I wonder what you are Wow! Christmas is for crackers on the Christmas tree Christmas is for kisses that you give to me Christmas is the footprints in the fluffy snow Christmas is the hanging of the mistletoe Christmas is for stockings that we like to fill Christmas is for happiness and all goodwill Christmas means I'm gonna need a slimmin' pill And that's why we call it merry Christmas It's a feeling you can't explain Walking off your dinner down a frosty lane Singing a carol in the silent night And back to stuff your super-sizing appetite Christmas is for Santa and for Christmas pud Christmas is for laughter and for feeling good Christmas is the only time to fall in love And that's why we call it merry Christmas And that's why we call it merry Christmas Merry Christmas, everybody!
