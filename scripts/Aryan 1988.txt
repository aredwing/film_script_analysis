What's your name? What's your quaIification? Pre-degree - Pre-degree? HoId this? What's this? That's Ioin cIoth.-What? It shouId be worn Iike this. Start.... You escaped from Hari because of your sheer Iuck. Yesterday, a murder had taken pIace here. If they don't find the murderer, They'II arrest the person whom they see. That's the practice of poIicemen here. Go & sIeep in the RaiIway Station or in the Bus Stand. Priest.... What's the matter?-I'm.... What do you want? Are you hungry? -Yes. Sit down here. There'II be peace if we wear cross thread. Why did the hymns of Gayathri wake me up? Oh Dawn! Lamp is shivering because God is present. Time is burning Iike these wooden pieces in the sacrificiaI fire. Measuring jar wiII be fiIIed with 9 types of grains in a distant pIace. Our desires wiII burn Iike a wick with the heIp of curses. Oh Dusk! Devaswom board demand more from peopIe, But they won't disburse much. Chits are must for the offerings. But the administration of the tempIe is very bad. Prayer materiaIs etc... They've reduced aII those things. Right from God's offerings, they've even reduced the quantity of food. Who's there to question them? EarIier, Devaswom peopIe had some respect for us. Now they're showing their animus towards Brahmins. Why do you've to suffer at their hands? Don't you want some job... What're you saying? Not that, I'm not trying it... Let me get it. If I get it, I won't be here doing aII these things. It's very painfuI. -What? You were born & initiated into brahminsm onIy in this paIace. Forget about the court. Why don't you cIean the pIace & give a respect to God. If I do that, then it'II become a criminaI case. Court has objected to our entry in this pIace. Recitation of Devaswom & Evening prayer has been stopped. God onIy shouId protect us. Our fate! Why's the quantity very Iess, today? Even the Gods are Iiving in abject poverty Iike us. Devaswom peopIe are offering us very IittIe. Okay, you sit down. I had. Don't Iie, son. We'II share & eat. Whatever is there. Brother, come here. Govinda Nair came here this morning. What's the matter? It seems, Arumugam is trying to grab our big house. And he even said something eIse. Father is upset after hearing this. What am I hearing father? Has Arumugam... Yes. Thinking that there's no use of seeking court's heIp. Everyone have soId their properties to Arumugam. I heard that my father Vasudevan had aIso soId. We've not soId it to anyone, isn't it? We don't have any respect. TiII now as the head, I had onIy bothered about our famiIy weIfare. And became an enemy to everyone. Let it be. Let them demoIish it or seII it. No, I'II not aIIow a stranger to step into this home, where God resides. Hey, you're depending on the tempIe food. So, what can you do? We've deposited aII the money in the court whatever we had earned so far. Lets wait for the judgement. SeIIing before it, wiII be iIIegaI. Even I've a right on that house. For that, there isn't any use of shouting here. I want to meet Arumugam in person. Not Arumugam, we've to meet the one who paved the way for this. ..That Govinda Nair. No use of meeting me. Arumugam is the feIIow. I tried for a compromise, but he didn't Iisten. He won't.... Others aren't fooIs Iike Brahmins. Arumugam knows to deceive peopIe. What're you trying to say? You're very smart. You're trying to seII my paIace in the Iure of money -Sir. I'm not invoIved in seIIing your paIace. Your predecessors were responsibIe for it. They were onIy interested in enjoying Iife. Don't get angry. Lessees aren't paying the rent properIy. But you peopIe aren't bothered to question them. That's not because of me. That's because of your smartness. OnIy because of that we're staying in smaII houses. And you peopIe are staying in big houses. You don't taIk about my paIace. I buiIt this with my hard work. What hard work did you do? You were onIy a manager & nothing eIse. What other income did you've? I don't want to make you understand, get Iost. Father... Otherwise, you ask him what does he wants. -I want to meet Arumugam. He was your partner when he took roots in our famiIy. You must be there when I up not him. You come with me. -No, I won't come. I'II go with you onIy. -Devan move aside. You're trying to attack an innocent person. Isn't your father here? No father, has gone out. You come & sit. No, when did your father go? He might have gone to the fieId. Hey Karuna, if Mr.Arumugam comes He'II throw your post & fIag. No father, nobody can throw this fIag. This'II be there tiII the meeting concIudes. Yes, it'II be there! You give me the mattock. I've some work. Oh sir, I thought of meeting you. What's the matter? This evening, you must come to our cIub. We've to discuss about an important matter? I want to meet Mr.Arumugam He's not in his house. What's the matter? He usurped aII our Iands & properties. Now he's trying to swaIIow our big house. Did you see him?-I saw him going in a car. He may be going to KoviIakam. He frequentIy visits that pIace, of Iate. Mr.Arumugam, now you're become a big shot, isn't it? I know that now PoIice Department is under your thumb But before the judgement if you step in my big hands. I'II cut your Iegs. I'm not scared of the guiIIotine I'II finish you. You can go. In which styIe you're pIaying? He pIanted a pIantain tree & Iooked after it Iike a chiId. When its bunch began to ripen, It's the painfuI feeIing when the crueI Lord orders it to be cut & presented. The feeIing of his disappointed poor chiIdren. We wanted to create that sorrowfuI mood. Do you understand? What have you understood? How many times I've toId you stand steady. Why're you standing Iike traffic poIiceman? You act carefuIIy. Don't cry chiIdren. This's the order of the Lord. Can I take another PIantain tree? May I take one cigarette? -Of course. It's impossibIe to teach these peopIe. Sir, I want a heIp. What's it? Can you act as the Lord? No diaIogues, onIy back ground music. No, I can't. Why're you saying Iike that? Who eIse is there in this country to act as Lord other than you. There's....your father. Sir Arumugam. The starving Brahmins are aIways enemies of your cIass. Oh God! We're not thinking Iike that. Are you thinking of creating a revoIution. Hey, if a man occupies more than 10 acres of, Waste Iand, wet Iand & coconut farm. The Government wiII seize it. The owners of 1000 acres of Tea, Coffee, & Rubber estates. Are being praised by the State PoIiticaI Leaders. In that case right, Ieft or NeutraI aII are same. Hey, the pIantain bunch of Changambuzha is an oId theme. Nowadays most of the brahmins are in abject Poverty. Sir, don't misunderstand. I came here simpIy to meet you. Like earIier, I've no time to sing & dance. No peace of mind aIso. Coffee. No, I'II drink outside. When you'II return? Within one week. I've some work at ErnakuIam. ShaII I go? Yes, you don't forget to have that usuaI medicine. Brother Unni didn't have coffee? How'II he have it? Without miIk. I'm going -Yes. Why is he Ieaving Parvathi here? His condition is bad there. He has no permanent job. He is an EIectrician. But, he understands famiIy situation & behaves accordingIy. That's my Iuck. Are you feeIing bore in KoviIakam. ShaII we pIay chess?-No. Why? Without food & sIeep. The Iords used to pIay. Now aIso there's no food & sIeep. But no one pIays Chess. When you Ieft after a tiff with my father. I thought that you're hating me aIso. I'm not hating anybody Aswathy. If at aII I do, it's myseIf. What about the big house? I'II argue the case & seek sometime. Father said, there's a Ioan Rs.20,000 on it. How'II you repay it? I'II earn it at any cost. Day before yesterday one man come to see me. Mr.Devan it'II be not easy for me to make proposaIs. You know my father weII, isn't it? He won't aIIow. Otherwise, I've to Ieave everything. No other way. Aswathy, don't do Iike that. I've many responsibiIities. Father...Mother...Sisters. And I don't want to you to share that worry with me. Let this end. DefiniteIy God'II pave a way for us. You go... We thought, that you'II bring something. If you had bought some Tapiocas. We wouId've managed by it somehow. Don't I need money to buy? Shopkeeper won't Iend us. You couId ask some of your friends, isn't it? Forget about us. Father is there, isn't it? How can we aIIow him to starve? I didn't see him at aII. He waIked away angriIy. When he returns, you don't create any confusion Iike yesterday. Don't reveaI our poverty. What's this? From where did you bring this PIantain bunch? Don't ask anything. BoiI them & serve them. No one shouId starve. Lord. I saw him chopping them steaIthiIy. If you give it, I'II take it back without anyone's knowIedge. OreIse, I'II Iose my job. I've 8 members in my famiIy. You did this, isn't it? You've stoIen it, isn't it? Father....-Don't touch me. No need to satiate our hunger by Iosing our respect. Come on...take it. Oh God, Lord I'm...why're you No...it's my son's sin. OnIy I've to... OnIy I've to undergo the punishment. When I pIanted that pIantain in your front yard. I never expected anything great in return. I never expected that the devotees of brahmins wiII take the pIantains & go. Someone from Devaswom office had come in search you. It seems, you shouId meet the president. Hey brahmins, who're you in this tempIe? I'm a Jr.Priest. I came to know that some of you're going against me & the Devaswom board. Sir, that's I.... I saw your protest personaIIy. I'm from a different caste, And I'm here to accumuIate weaIth. I heard such of your shouts. I wasn't there in that crowd. Phew, are you Iying infront of me? PeopIe have seen you participating in the protest raIIy. You're eking your IiveIihood by eating the defiIed food from here. You can't do anything to me. I'm not in the association nor I was in the protest raIIy. I didn't go against the board as weII as the president. But I've some doubts.-Doubts? Leave me. What's this? Hey, I'II teach you a Iesson man. Why do you cry? Has anything happened to you? What shouId happen? PeopIe toId so many things. It seems, you were beaten up. Don't beIieve anything. Can't you see me? Don't cry, dear. There was just a confrontation, that's aII. Why shouId we interfere in aII those things? They're big shots, isn't it? If they pick up fight with us do we've to keep quiet? I'm not such a shameIess and a coward person. To benefit from unnecessary fights? You've Iost your job too. Let it be. I get onIy Rs.75 saIary for working the whoIe day. Do you know that? I get just Rs.3 to prepare SandaI paste Out of this hard work. No use. Donation goes to the board. Whatever it is? It was a job, isn't it? What're you going to do now? TiII now, I feIt proud that I'm a brahmins. OnIy now, I understood that it is worthIess. Money is important than truth & justice. I'II earn it. Somehow, by hook or crook.... What's it sir?-Get up, man. Hey, waIk man. Put him into the jeep. Oh God Deva, My son...My son... Where did you hide it? I didn't steaI anything. Don't hit my son -Move.... TeII me... What's it? What's it? It seems, he had stoIen the jeweIs from the tempIe. It's fate! What eIse can we caII it? Oh God..... You be caIm. None can take away God's beIongings. Why do you shout? Everyone can have a Iook when they bring it out. EarIier, you were Iiving on God's offerings. Now, are you steaIing to Iive happiIy? But, don't steaI God's beIongings. Oh God. Brother.... Search upstairs. Search in the kitchen. Search that drawer & that cupboard. Brother... Don't hit him. Daughter...-Don't hit my brother. Your son threatened me. He bashed the President of Devaswom board. That's pardonabIe. But this isn't pardonabIe. Oh God, don't hit my son. Don't hit my son. Oh God. My son... Search in this. My son -Oh God. My son won't do Iike this. Hey teII me, where're the remaining jeweIs? I don't know -TeII me. My son. Don't hit my son. Bash him up. Oh God, don't hit my son. Move away. Don't taIk. If you punish the innocent God won't spare you. You'II be ruined.-Forgive me. I'm doing my duty. Then, If I, a Iow caste, have touched your son and defiIed. Take this Rs.2 Take an oiI bath & attain purity. I'II bring out the truth from him. Don't take away my son. Don't take my son. I didn't steaI. I didn't steaI. Take this offerings. This isn't the pIace to sIeep. Go somewhere eIse & sIeep. One tea. Why do you spend your hard earned money there? I'm not spending it simpIy. Sometimes I may get it back. If you're interested, even you spend there. You'II get back doubIe the money. I don't want. You're running the business, aren't you? One more bun. What's the totaI?-4. Oh God.

Go man.... My father is sending.... -Go man.... One more bun pIease. It has come to Rs.6.45 -Okay. What eIse do you need? -Take out the money. I don't have money. If you don't have money then why did you....? I'II break your teeth. What?-Hey, caII our men. Why?-ShouId break his Iimbs. It seems, he doesn't have money but ate everything. Do whatever you can do. This is better than starving, isn't it? Hey Idiot, I had a doubt earIier itseIf. But I didn't expect that a person wiII deceive me Iike this. Hey Idiot, after eating everything. Why did you make that poor feIIow to suffer? Hey, there're many big hoteIs here. CouIdn't you go there & Iick many varieties of dishes? Give that. I don't understand the Ianguage they speak. Just because you're a MaIayaIee I expressed my sorrows. MaIayaIee! They're the dacoits who're going to other pIaces to tarnish their names. They'II come with the Iuggages etc. Give me that suitcase. There's nothing in that box. OnIy my shirt and dhoti is there. That can be used as a wick & to cIean the tabIe. They even pay money for the oId junk. Move.... Don't try to deceive me Iike that. I'm not trying to deceive you. If I get a job... I'II pay your money. Go away without further arguments anything. OreIse there'II be a fight. I've some work. Come here, man. Even though he had reacted Iike that he's good souI. I aIso suffered Iike you when I came here. He had onIy protected me. Then, go there when he isn't busy. Don't Ieave him. Get friendIy with him. Have you come here after kiIIing or robbing something? What was your profession there? I was a priest in the tempIe. Being a Priest, why're you roaming Iike this? Take it. Don't see me hereafter. What?-I don't have any pIace to go to. And this is a new pIace for me. PoIice wiII catch me if they see me roaming in the might. You shouId've thought about that when you started from your pIace. Did you think that it's easy to earn money here. Many peopIe are coming from KeraIa daiIy Iike the fiIes on the jack fruit. We can heIp them to some extent. But onIy few prosper. Why're you coming behind me? PIease heIp me. Isn't what you ate is enough. Do I've to heIp you further? No use coming behind me. Go somewhere eIse. PoIice wiII be on the rounds during midnight.

Father toId me that ''you're a Brahmin''. Priest? Now to whom're you offering the prayers, to the Sun God? How can a priest work as ''Bhar vaIa''? Bhar vaIa means? SeIIing tea to others from the tea shop. Father gives sheIter to aII the persons coming from KeraIa. A person who was here before had stoIen our money and ran away. Where did you take your bath? From the tap. My father toId me that there're many ponds in KeraIa. I've not seen. There're many ponds here. -Where? But they charge money to take bath. It's swimming pooI. Come...don't you want your ''Nashtha''. Nashtha means? This is your suitcase, isn't it? Someone wiII rob it if you keep it here. This is the centre of robbers. Where's your father? He'II come back now, sit down. What's your name? Are you studying? In which cIass? I'm studying in 2nd year in Music Academy. Who knows, what's mixed in this? In some case, miIk powder is the cheapest source. Why did you stop eating? Just because it's ''Roti''? Hey, Iook here. IdIies & Dosai's won't be avaiIabIe here Iike in KeraIa. This is Bombay. You eat that fuIIy. Bring some water for him. What's it? Show him the market. He shouId know the pIaces, if he wants to buy something, isn't it? Don't you've another change? Look here. He's asking whether you've dresses to change. No.... This won't work out if you come out, with this, far business. A person who stayed here earIier, his cIothes may be here.

Martin, this man is... -My reIative. ReIative? What's his name? What's your name? Do you've any other reIatives Iike him here? No... No? Why did he teII him a different name? Otherwise they won't aIIow you to stay here. If he gets the sIightest doubt that you've come a different pIace. He'II kiII you or he'II bIast you. The next Don is Majid Khan. We're staying in his street. Martin who had asked you, isn't it? He has many Dons Iike him. They dare to do everything. Martin murdered a person in this pIace onIy. Didn't you see him roaming freeIy? We can even think that there's a fight amongst them. Amongst whom? Amongst Dons. PIease have a Iook at the Newspaper. Not a day wiII pass in Bombay without 8-10 murders. What man? Are you scared?-No. Then, waIk boIdIy. Look at the watches. Bash him...bash him. You're Iooking very smart in this dress. Zip your pant. Oh God... Give me, one tea, pack of wiIIs and a match box.

What'II you give Kunjarrai if you seII tea? You'II give him 10ps for a rupee, isn't it? They get one in 10. Anyone can fight. Are you pIanning to participate in that? No...-We'II just try to expose our muscIe power. Oh God, no.. Where's the money? PIease, forgive me. I'II pay you as soon as I seII it. Okay. Who's he? I toId you about Majid Khan isn't it? He's the henchman of that Don. I buy smuggIed goods onIy from him. I owed him some money. He was asking for that onIy. Open the gate. BeautifuI, son. What's it, Krishnan Nair? Sir, Assistant Commissioner AIbert has come. Let him come. You go. Yes sir. You're staying in Tuticorin, isn't it? I've heard Iot about you. -PIease sit down. Why did you take the troubIe of coming here? You couId've caIIed me, isn't it? Anyway, teII me how can I be of heIp to you? Oh God! What's this? Whose dead body is this? What's this? Good, you can speak TamiI aIso fIuentIy. Don't you know, who's he & why & how he was murdered? Poor feIIow. Then, why do you have so many goondas? No...you can't give me, isn't it? He has kiIIed, my brother... UncIe, even my wife. What couId you do tiII date? I can show you many photos Iike this as evidence. I didn't come here to see the snaps. What eIse do you want?

That's why, I'm money ordering it in your name. Even if its onIy sufficient for a square meaI. I'II be peacefuI here. Don't reveaI my name there. Don't teII them about this Ietter as weII as my address. You know Devaswom peopIe & the poIice men hate me, isn't it? So, be carefuI. Yours IovingIy, Devanarayanan. Whom are you writing to?

If I stand in this fire I'II get burnt. Even you'II get burnt because of me. Not necessary. In this worId, no body offers job to a Brahmins, mother. I'II go in incognito. I'II eke my IiveIihood by washing the defiIe pIates etc. Nobody shouId worry about me. Son... Mother, atIeast you beIieve me. They had put me behind bars for the crime which I hadn't done. I'm not worried because of that. I'm branded as a thief. Because of that my sisters marriages are jeopardized. I'm worried about that. Don't cry, dear.

Where did you Iearn aII this from? WiII you teach me aII this? CouIdn't you kiII him? Be carefuI. Martin and his gang are very crueI. Don't get beaten up unnecessariIy. I was beaten up by some peopIe unnecessariIy. Hereafter,it has become a necessity to beat as weII as get beaten. Why don't we continue this? Bear...Bear! Bear's pIay. Go there.. KiII him. Come on start. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him - Beat him. Long Iive Namboodri... Long Iive Namboodri. My money. Didn't I teII you not to hit him? My money. I won't give you money. Tomorrow, you've to come at 5 pm. This is the address. According to me, everyone knows about Mr.Karib Sahib. He's the oId smuggIer Don. Present day Dons had once worked under him. IncIuding the dreaded Majid Khan. He knows each and every Ianguage of this country weII. He speaks MaIayaIam fIuentIy. He Iives behind this. But I won't come there. Why? You don't know about the animus between Majid and Sahib. Their men are behind the murders, robberies etc. here daiIy. How are we concerned with it? It's not a probIem for us, but it's a probIem for me. I'm buying goods from Majid's Khan's party. If he sees me in Karim Sahib's pIace, Then, he'II not onIy refrain from giving goods, My friend, he'II chop of my head. So don't worry about me, I'II go... I'm IittIe busy, that's why... Whatever you may say, I'II not sit on this. Brother... How come you're here? Who's that person who went on that motorcycIe? He's... He's my cIassmate. Do you peopIe study here? No...we came here just Iike that. Dear, do you think this wiII work out? Oh God, it's not what you think. Look, pIease don't teII my father about it. You heard what Sahib said, isn't it? Are you prepared to work with us? What're you thinking? I'm thinking of my famiIy. What have you decided? I'II do any work... Provided it gives me money. Then, I'm prepared to do any meniaI job. This Ietter came a week ago. Father wants to see you. To my dearest Devan, At home, things are managed by your money. Regarding the case against Arumugam, If you don't send the Iawyer's fee of Rs.1000 immediateIy. We'II Iose. Here, your father is stiII bedridden. Rest of them are fine. Yours Ioving Unni Krishnan. Whose Ietter? Is it from your brother-in-Iaw? -Yes. Oh! Is it Devan? When did you come? - A Short whiIe ago. I was waiting to see you. Where do you sIeep now? In my office onIy. Don't forget us when you prosper. Come here often. I won't forget anyone. That's the nature of human beings. I've seen many peopIe whom I had heIped. They'II just turn their faces and waIk away. That's my experience. I won't be one of them. May the creator give you aII the happiness. Then, I've something to teII you. What's it? About Saihnu. Even though I had waIked away haIf-way. Inform me about Saihnu's marriage. I'II definiteIy attend even if I'm busy. Oh God...won't I inform you? Oh! I forgot to ask you. What's your job? Don't notice me. Tomorrow night at 1 1'o cIock... near Band Stand. You've to hand over this in the SeaguII Boat. We had asked for 4 Lakhs. If you have the money, I've the item with me. If we couId get a written statement that he's Karim Sahib's man, I can arrest him at that moment. If you arrest him, you'II be more benefited than me. I know that. But we've to get a written statement from him. If you're ready to give a written statement that you're Karim's man, I'II Ieave you. WiII you give it in writing? WiII you give it in writing or not? WiII you give it in writing or not? TeII this man to give in writing whatever I want from him. If he refuses, then shut his mouth forever. Yes sir. TeII me. WiII you sign or not? No.... TeII me... I'II not Ieave you aIive either way..Understood? I need your signature. Even now... TeII me... TeII me...right now. Don't.... Lie down! I'm... No...No...We'II taIk Iater.... By God's grace, you're saved. Now, there's nothing to worry. You take rest, I'II go... TiII he's aIright, you stay with him. Understood? - Yes, sir. Do you know what happened? I.... You were Iying unconscious on the raiIway track. Don't know who admitted you in the hospitaI? You came here from there. Now Mr.Karim Sahib has Iots of respect for you. If you had reveaIed our secrets to them, They wouId've caught our goods in the port itseIf. What're you thinking? I've sent money to your house. How? I got this Ietter from your pocket. I found the address in it. They had mentioned about the need for money. Karim Sahib heIps their men after seeing their difficuIties. Who's Unnikrishnan who wrote this? My sister's husband. Good morning, brother. He's Karim Sahib's son. Sir... Where's he? Do you think you can marry Saihnu? Sure? What's this? You can't escape if you get caught again. Before you die painfuIIy, You can easiIy die, if you've this. Sir, do you want to buy ''Mid-Day'' paper? Give me one ''Mid-Day'' paper. Like the music from the goIden fIute swaying with the breeze. Like the rhythm getting mingIed with cuckoo's notes. Let's fIoat in our dreams and drown in Iove. Without anyone's knowIedge. Like the rhythm getting mingIed with the music from the goIden fIute. Cupid caresses the spreaded feathers of Peacock, OnIy when the CIouds meIt. When you sweII Iike the waves, And your garments gets wet and stick to the body, I'II search pearIs in you. Without anyone's knowIedge. The fIower of imagination bIossoms in the bower of Iove. When the vermiIion coIour spreads on the dusk, And when the beauty Ioiters in beauty, We'II Iook for that good day. Without anyone's knowIedge. The girI whom I Ioved, presented me this chain. I had attached a Iocket to this to end everything on a fine day. Cyanide which Karim Sahib gave me is in this. Death! Why did you go to jaiI? I was working sincereIy in the tempIe. SincereIy, I was offering prayers to God with true devotion. But, they fiIed a faIse case that I stoIe the jeweIs of the God. They bashed me infront of my famiIy. At the court, me and my famiIy.... They disgraced, insuIted & bad mouthed the entire cIan of Brahmins. Yes, this bIack coat is, the symboI of your right to argue the case. Your BIack Coat doesn't suit our dress code as weII as our cIimatic condition. Then, why.... -That isn't the question. If it's about this cross thread, It's for my Guru's remembrance, whom I met at the age of 7, And it's the symboI of the Vedas I studied. I beIong to ''Yajur Veda''. Nobody questioned you which type of veda you beIong to? Nobody wiII question. Country's History, CuIture & Heritage.... Who's interested to know about them here? Whether it's EngIish, French or Arabic... He gets job here if he Iearns any of them. He's respected and honoured. If a person toiIs for years & Iearns the ancient Ianguage, 'Sanskrit', Who's there to respect him? Don't taIk unnecessary things. Don't use 3rd rate meIodrama diaIogues as shown in the court scenes of a movie. No...I've seen the 1st rate behaviour of Terrorists in the court. No...sir, I don't have the wiII power as weII as the strength Iike them. I'm a poor Brahmin. They punished me without any evidences or witnesses. They had put me behind bars for a year. Veda means knowIedge. One who attains its compIete knowIedge is caIIed Nam-boo-dri (Brahmin). But, I didn't gain any knowIedge of them. I'm searching for a new knowIedge here to Iead my Iife, By abandoning everything. I'm doing Murders etc... I want to achieve my goaI...I'm not bothered about the right path. Then, I've to go back to my pIace. I want to get back my PaIace again. And Iive there as a weaIthy Brahmin with respect atIeast for a day. That's my wish... And my dream. Who's this girI? TeII me. Who's this girI? I Iove her and I want to marry her. Do you want to marry a beggar's daughter? Aren't you bothered about my prestige? Aren't you ashamed? They may be poor, but they're decent and respectabIe, And not Murderers and SmuggIers Iike you. What did you say? I'II kiII you. KiII me. My mother and sister had become a prey to your bIack deeds. Why did you Ieave me aIive? KiII me too. After today, that girI & her beggar father shouIdn't be seen in Bombay. Father! Father! Father! Hey, what're you doing, rascaI? Karim Sahib has commanded us to do this. Let it be from anyone, I won't Iet him suffer. What'II you do, Dog? Bash that RascaI. Get Iost, man. You son of a pig. This time you've escaped. If you come into this IocaIity again... I'II make mince meat out of you. You dog's progeny. What's going on here, man? Go... Can't MaIayaIees Iive here in peace? We won't spare any one. It's me who's saying it. I'm the Don of this pIace. Go....Go...Go. Go man....Go you, dog.. Go you, dog. Get down. Oh, you're a MaIayaIee, isn't it? You go... Go man... Hereafter, I won't keep quiet if anyone screams. Go man. Hey, idiot. Do you know with whom were you roaming? He isn't an ordinary person. He's a big shot. Get up. Stop it! Don't hit her. Leave her - Leave me. I'm fed up... Didn't you hear? -I know everything. Is it a crime to Iove? Your daughter didn't commit any mistake. You won't understand if I say. They won't aIIow us to Iive here. What can I do? Oh God! I'm dead. Sahinu, don't cry. I'II soIve everything. What are you going to do? I've 3 sisters. I consider Saihnu aIso Iike them. My sisters won't suffer tiII I'm aIive. Cowards won't suit your profession. You're ungratefuI and disIoyaI wretch. Before that, pIease Iisten to me. OnIy for your sake, I started to use this pistoI. I earned money through that sin. Even then, I've respect & IoyaIty towards you. But before that... When I was roaming here hungry, That poor feIIow heIped me! Can I forget him? Can I be quiet if you troubIe him unnecessary? If I do, It'II be ungratefuIness, isn't it? If it's wrong to save the one who heIped me. You can punish me. BuIIets are in this. I can never forgive those peopIe who're misguiding my onIy son. Both of them have committed the mistake. Without punishing your son, Is it fair to punish onIy that girI? Devan, I want onIy this much. After today, that girI shouIdn't meet my son, And this game shouId end here. Give this money to the person who had heIped you, And if you want more, then ask me. I know how you earned this money. And I know how many of them shed their bIood for this. Did you come here to threaten me? No....you had sent your men to threaten me. Even though I'm struggIing to make both ends meet, I don't want this money. The person who threw this money just now, Once upon a time, he didn't have a singIe pie. Do you remember? When you didn't have the money to pay, for the food you had, And when that video man skinned you. Do you remember the person who saved you by paying that money? When you were on the death-bed shot by a goonda, Do you remember my daughter Baithu, who saved you by giving her bIood? You don't remember. 10-30 yrs back, even if you've forgotten the food which my daughter gave you, But the MaIayaIam Ianguage which she taught you, you.... I'm that same Kunjarri. The PoIicemen who asked me about you at that time, When they tortured me day and night & asked about you, If I had reveaIed... I wouId've buiIt a storeyed buiIding Iike this. I wouId've earned doubIe the money which you threw now. TiII now, I've just heIped. Do you want me and my daughter to be banished from this town? What mistake we've committed to antagonise you? TeII me. No use of taking revenge out of enemity. Then, there won't be vaIue for affection and reIationships. Even after accumuIating so much by doing murders & smuggIing, Aren't you stiII satisfied? If you're satisfied onIy after seeing our graves, If you want to kiII us, then send for your men. I'II come here with my daughter. KiII us... That'II be the wages given to me from my oId friend. Go ahead. Son... I was mistaken. My entire Iife was spent doing bad deeds and taking revenge. I forgot these smaII deIicate Ioving reIationships. I was dazzIed by weaIth. Forgive me. You'II be married. DefiniteIy be married. What sort of a man you're? Are you dreaming? I don't beIieve. - Okay, I'II go. PIease wait... Inform Mr.Karim that we've accepted these things with joy. What?-Not 'what'?...Go... Sir, when is the marriage? Come here. Marriage wiII be performed after our HoIi festivaI. I don't mind whoever your son marries. But Devan who bashed me on that street... I've aIready toId you the reason for that. Don't taIk further about it. Today we're inviting big PoIice Officers. You go and make aII the arrangements. Then, what about our consignment - Devan wiII take care of aII that. Do whatever you're toId. Take it. I'II manage him. You're aIways heIpfuI to me. But, you've to be very carefuI with that Robert AIberto. Where's Nair? With whom're you working? My peopIe are searching you in many pIaces. I came here onIy after knowing that. Anyway, thanks for coming here. I've a request before you arrest me. Sir, you've to see this. There're many peopIe here to respect your uniform as weII as Law. But there're peopIe who seII this uniform from 25 paise - 40 Iakhs. If you don't know about them, then pIease see this cassette. Tomorrow, after 5 PM, 1000 copies of this cassette wiII reach video Iibraries in this city. I'II hand it over to the press & Ministers & Government officiaIs. Lakhs of peopIe wiII see it. If you roam in the city boasting, that you're a PoIiceman, PeopIe wiII spit on every poIice man, who are in Khaki uniform. They'II stone you.. They'II insuIt you.. Think weII before you do anything. When you roam without the uniform & the cap... You'II get caught by me. At that time, I'II settIe the oId scores & repay you with interest. First, you watch this tape. Then, decide what you shouId do. If you don't reIease my peopIe within 24 hours, As I said, I'II circuIate this cassette. Within 24 hrs... I'm reIeased by God's grace. I got back the items which were caught by the PoIice. Thanks. I've to thank him.-Sir. I'm announcing that from today he's my heir. PIease take this seat. Sit down. Sir... -Sit down... -I... I don't find anyone who's a better choice to occupy this chair. This GoId is worth 3 crores, so be carefuI. We Iost this once... That shouIdn't be repeated. Tonight, this box shouId reach Poona. You take even pappai with you. This is the most important operation than what we've done so far. I know what to do. I don't want to encourage traitors. Before an enemy becomes friend, he has to prove his IoyaIty. When.... Namboodri, we had heard that Majid Khan is going to Ieave this city. It's true what we had heard. I went to the airport to check the ticket. He has booked a ticket for tomorrow to Ieave for Dubai. We won't get him again if we Ieave him now, isn't it? What? - Buddy, we shouIdn't Ieave him so easiIy. It's around 16 kms from Majid Khan's house to the airport. From his starting point to the airport, we can't harm him. Because, there're Iots of guards around him. If we think of harming him on the way, Benz Cars, fuII of armed goondas are in the front and at the back of his car. Even if they get a sIight doubt, they'II start bIasting. Then, how can we harm him? Buddy, arrange few taxies for me tomorrow. Hey, you.... Hey, he's coming, take the car fast. On the day of HoIi, Mass murders which were committed on Riaz Iane. Accused 1-5, Under Sec.307 of Indian PenaI Code, Are sentenced to rigorous Iife imprisonment. Devan, who attacked them, For the crimes of murdering & using the weapons without Iicence.. Under the Section 307, I.P.C. & Under Section 27 of Arms Act, I sentence him to 4 years of rigorous imprisonment. Get in.... Sir. What's this? This is the GoId which I had Iost. I handed over this to Nair that day. I came here to return this to you. Son, didn't Nimi teII you, That I've given up aII the wrong doings. Sir, this is yours. Son, I'm proud of you. You're truthfuI, honest, IoyaI human being. That's why, you've come to return this weaIth. I'II hand over aII this to you. - Sir... My bIessings are aIways with you. Go... It's time for my prayers. These are the Ietters sent by Unni Krishnan. I've written that you're working in Navy. Money which you had sent isn't enough to repay the house Ioan. Money? Who had sent the money? Karim Sahib? No...He transferred aII his properties to a charitabIe institution. I had sent the money. Did you sent it for aII the 4 years continuousIy? According to the experience which I had in my pIace, I never expected that I wouId get this affection and heIp. I didn't think that it'II end up Iike this. Now, I've to go back to my pIace. I took aII these pains onIy for that. Even I had foIIowed the wrong route... Whatever I earned... You know everything, isn't it? - Yes. When're you starting? - Tomorrow... Before that, I want to meet Hassan. He's in GuIf. I've sent him our contracts. Then here, You're the onIy person who's very cIose & affectionate, isn't it? How can I bid-adieu to you? What'II you do if I go? I don't know. So far, It was a job for me to wait for you. Now, even that task is over. If you remember that I'm here, Write a Ietter to me sometimes. How can I forget you, who remembered onIy me tiII now? ShaII I ask you one thing? Do you Iike to come with me.. To my house. As the wife of Devanarayanan Namboodri. ShaII I change your name as NirmaIa Andherjan? Are you coming? You've to come. Room is ready, sir. If we go there suddenIy, I don't know how my famiIy wiII weIcome you. So.. first, I'II go aIone... I'II be back soon. Mother... Mother.. Mother.. Father... Why did you come here? OnIy my body has become insensitive. Not my mind and inteIIect. Didn't I order you not to step into this house? Father. Won't you aIIow me to die peacefuIIy? Dear, Where's Subathra and Thathira Kutty. Why do you ask about them? How're you reIated to them? Where were you for so Iong? Without bothering about your sick father, mother & your sisters. You waIked away, isn't it? Mother, To Unni Krishna, I had sent... -Don't give any excuses. Didn't you hear what your father said? Better waIk out... Mother, Iisten to what I...-I don't... I don't want to hear anything. I was tormented whenever your father used to curse you. Now, I've understand. You're the curse for this famiIy. Now, you're no use to us. Go away... Get out. Labour Union Long Live.... Long Iive comrade Karunan..Iong Iive ...Long Iive comrade Karunan. Long Iive revoIution... Long Iive revoIution. Labour union Iong Iive... Iong Iive... Long Iive Karunan.. Long Iive Karunan. Long Iive revoIution... Long Iive revoIution. Castesim down...down... They asked us to shift to another room. Someone was to occupy that room. Forgive us, sir. VIP's room was aIIotted to you. He arrived at that time.-Who? EarIier he used to sIeep on roads. Now, he gets sIeep onIy if he sIeeps in the AC room. Who's he? Sir, do you know him? If I had bad mouthed him, then pIease forgive me. Now, he's an exaIted person in the ruIing party. Just because the authority is in your hand, If you pIay the fooI, Then remember, one who goes up wiII have to come down aIso. I've somehow managed to compromise this time. Don't repeat this. Rest of the matters... Let Kuttikrishnan be here. I'II teII you...others can go. Is it Devan? You? Here? I was accommodated in this room. As soon as the VIP arrived, I was shifted to another room. I've not met you for quite sometime. We've to taIk in detaiIs. I've a probIem to soIve. I'II come to your room. PubIic has a different opinion about PoIiticians. But, don't take me to be Iike that. I won't... How do you peopIe get money without grabbing it from the peopIe who have? You don't have any properties to invest it and spend, isn't it? Democracy, isn't it? You may've expenses.Take it. Take it with your right hand. If I give a speech that your brahmin society is affIicted, Then peopIe'II outcaste me. Reason? In India, majority of the peopIe are middIe cIass. In North, peopIe who beIong to Iow and Harijan caste, Are kiIIed in hordes by the upper caste peopIe. Do you know that? They're even burning peopIe. MaIefactors shouId be punished. None has 2 opinions about it. Torturing the innocents is unbearabIe. You were a IandIord. You're creating revoIution instead of doing agricuIture. I don't have time for argument. Don't.... Arumugam who has unjustIy grabbed my house, WiII you heIp me to get that back? I'II repay the Ioan with interest. That case is pending in the court stiII, isn't it? Yes. - Then, I'II try. You've to heIp me for another thing too. You know that I went to jaiI for steaIing God's jeweIs, isn't it? But, I was innocent. -Then, who? The remaining jeweIs which weren't stoIen, And the person who found them in my house, May be behind this. - That means.... It must be Arumugam & Sanghu. Can you heIp me in re-opening that case.. To find out the reaI cuIprits. As a friend. It's my duty to prove that you're innocent. Sure! I can't bear to hear peopIe's gossip. I don't beIieve that your sister got spoiIed. Even then, can we shut peopIe's mouth? No one knows about Unni Krishnan's whereabouts. In between, Your 2nd sister got saved. Consider that as her good Iuck. OreIse, she wouIdn't have got married Iike this. Where's Subathra? Didn't your mother teII you anything? Even she didn't teII me the whereabouts of Unni Krishnan. She scoIded me. I couIdn't think of asking here anything, so I waIked out. You teII me. Where're my sisters? I don't know about the younger one. May be, her sister wouId've taken her thinking that she shouIdn't suffer here. Savithri got married in an exaIted famiIy. He is a very honest person. She must have done some good deeds in her previous birth. Otherwise, wouId she have got such a good husband? You didn't teII me her address. Don't you know? In the East of IIIam kuIIam. Brother... Where's Thathirakutty? Isn't she at home? Nobody is coming to see me. Even he isn't sending me there. Why? He's of that type. Brother, you pIease come. Brother, what wouId you Iike to have? Let him come. Where's your husband? What's the matter? My brother - He... It was me you were asking about. Did you come to see your sister? Not that I was dazzIed by her beauty, I brought her to heIp me at this oId age. Don't come here to spoiI my reputation. PIease Ieave this pIace. Why do you taIk Iike this? Though its Iate, I've understood the nature of your famiIy. Leave the pIace. Take back this too. Oh God! Why do you behave Iike this with my brother? Don't touch. If he has bought it with his money. Then, I know the way he has earned it. Or eIse, if you have bought it from your famiIy's money, PeopIe are gossiping how you peopIe had earned that. Take them back. Brother.... You shouIdn't mistake. Even if he's short tempered, he's a good person. TeII mother, I'm happy here. When I enquired in the Post office, I came to know that Unni Krishnan's posts are redirected to this address. Yes, I'm Devan. You never expected, that I'II find you, isn't it? The money, which I had sent for my famiIy out of hard Iabour, Are you Iiving here as an estate owner with that money? Since you were the cause for ruining my famiIy, so you shouIdn't be aIive. Brother.... Don't make me a widow. You? What's this dear? Were you aIso invoIved in this? I don't understand anything. Are you coming onIy now to enquire about aII this? Where were you so Iong? I didn't wish that it shouId happen Iike this. Do you know what happened? Not onIy his own wife, but a man can have many... They've the right to marry any number of times, That's been the ruIe for brahmins since Iong back. But my sister became one of your wives. I can't bear to see her as your concubine. Take her away somewhere. Let her Iead a good Iife. She had toId me that she'II die If I don't heed her words. After everything is over & you've come here to punish now? WouId I've faced this pIight if you were with us? Devan, bygones are bygones. None can fight with their destiny. No...Now, it shouId be me who's going to decide about my destiny. What man? I hope you're in fuII booz. Did you go to your bed earIy? The case of your paIace probIem is soIved now. This's the copy of the petition which was submitted by 2 Iawyers. You can even stay there from today itseIf. Then, regarding the theft case, We've to ampIify it as a big incident. Processions'II be taken out here regarding that matter. They may even shout sIogans in protest. Question'II be raised in AssembIy. We've decided to handIe this probIem through our party. Before that, we've to meet the D.I.G. This theft was proved in the court once... He's the one who underwent the punishment,isn't it? There're some obstacIes in re-arguing that case. TeII me if it's a probIem for you, I'II inform C.M. to contact you directIy. Oh God! Why? Since you came here personaIIy... Then, you've to pursue this case somehow or the other. Sir, evidences are needed for that. StoIen jeweIs or the finger prints are needed. OreIse there's no use arguing the case on hypothesis. No...I'II submit the evidences. We may even need your department's heIp for that. Yes sir. I'II sent it immediateIy. Yes. I'm Arumugam speaking. Who's it? I'm caIIing from Crime Branch Office, Trivandrum. EarIier, God's jeweI were stoIen in your pIace, isn't it? A person has been transferred here to investigate that case. You've to be in your pIace tomorrow. Where did he caII from? May be he's fooIing you. That's right. Evidences..they... Yes. What? That's very risky. You contact him and teII... I can't. Who's caIIing at midnight? Who's it man? What's the matter? You're responsibIe for it. I don't want to say anything now, you go and sIeep. Why're you getting angry Iike this? Yes. Arumugam informed me just now. Someone caIIed me aIso. But Arumugam is shouting at me to come there immediateIy. I can't go during midnight. Whatever it's, Iet it be dayIight. Why're you Iate? You bIew up before you Iistened to the matter fuIIy. Let him come, even I'm a PoIice Officer. You can say that... But my profession... PoIiticaI image which I've estabIished so far. Radhakrishna is invoIved in this onIy because of me. So what? Don't waste time in taIking. The matter which we've to think about... This is a moth eaten case. But the person who's pursuing the case again after so many years, WouId've sureIy got some evidences. We've to find out who's behind this. It's CBI, who eIse can it be? Now many CBI's have arrived to investigate the cases here. They've been ordered to investigate about the stoIen coconuts aIso. It's not CBI, man. That Karunan... And that fooI Namboodri who had gone to jaiI regarding that theft. Now, I've understood that every action has got an equaI & opposite reaction. Break that, man. When they'II handcuff and take me infront of pubIic..when I think about it... You shut up, man. He's torturing me when I'm in a fix. No need of this. If they interrogate me, I'II teII them the truth. If I don't, then my poIiticaI image wiII be tarnished. Even others are aIso bothered about their image. What do you want? I just have the key of the Iocker where the stoIen jeweIs are kept, And I'm not invoIved in any other crime. Lawyer, isn't your father-in-Iaw invoIved in this? Don't try to escape Iike that. Everyone wiII be caught. How did you buy the tea estate? How did you buy the rubber estate and he has some taxis. They are aII important evidences. You're taIking as if you've not accumuIated anything. If they catch me, I'II teII them everything. Even if they're very cIever officers, They won't get even a bit of the things which we've soId. We've to shift the jeweIs from the Iocker immediateIy. Then, where to keep them safeIy? SafeIy? Throw them into the sea or in the forest, idiot. Then, Lawyer pIease go to the Bank immediateIy. Bank won't be open now. Go to Bank Manager's house and.... We're giving them a chance for suspicion. What's the use onIy if he goes? He'II find onIy my key. OnIy if I open it, you can get your key. We 3 shouId go. You were the cause for it. The things were Iocked in my Iocker. But, you Iocked my key in your Iocker, And you handed over that key to the Iawyer not trusting me. Yes, I don't trust you. You've to come to the Bank at 10'o cIock with the key. We'II come there. Since I joined with you peopIe, I shouId be sIippered. Then, shaII I give you? I've to catch him tomorrow before 10 am. Do you remember me? I was in Bombay for a Iong time. I worked in the pIace where they chop and murder peopIe. Give me that Iocker key. - Which key? Which Iocker? Don't shout, Iisten to me. -Oh God! Oh! You're a Iawyer, isn't it? Don't you know Iaw? I want to teII you something. One minute. Do you remember me? I was imprisoned for steaIing God's jeweIs. Then, I was banished from this pIace. I'm Devanarayana Namboodri. What do you want now? Advocate Radhakrishna has given me a task to do. Since he couIdn't come here, he handed over this key to me. You're waiting for this, isn't it? What do you mean? SoftIy. With the heIp of this key, Don't you want to take back your key from Inspector Chandappan's Iocker? You've hidden the remaining jeweIs which you couIdn't seII, isn't it? JeweIs? What jeweIs? Do I've to open that infront of PubIic, PoIice & devotees? Don't. Then You, Inspector Chandappan.. And your partners who were invoIved in this theft shouId meet me. I'II be at my home. Why've you aII come here? I've caIIed them here. Even if its Iong since you've met them, Father, you can't forget them so easiIy. You Majesty... You caII me Devan. - Okay. At that time, I've committed some mistakes. PIease forget them. As an atonement, Boss wiII do anything for you. He may even give you whatever you quote. How much? 1 Iakh...2 Iakhs ..10 Iakhs. I've the money which he's ready to give. I didn't Iose that thing in my famiIy which I couId compensate with money. Then, pIease teII, what shouId we do? Don't think of me... AtIeast think of my daughter and... He's an innocent. You can make me as a thief infront of pubIic. You can punish me for the crime which I hadn't done. You can beat me into puIp, isn't it? I can forget aII those. Do you know who he's? My father swooned after seeing his son getting bashed. Can you bring him back to his normaI condition? Can you bring back my sister's Iife which was ruined? Answer me, dogs. StiII my father beIieves that I'm a thief. Can you teII him that you've stoIen the jeweIs? TeII me, you rascaI. Hey, if you insuIt us, after inviting us to your house, Hey Dog's progeny, I'II... Son... No one shouId utter a word. Hey, I know why you're angry with me? Because of your discrimination against Iow caste peopIe. Lady of the same caste, even if she's 60 yrs oId. You peopIe are showing bias towards her. OnIy you peopIe wiII give importance to caste and cIass. Didn't you give my father Rs.2 to attain purity just because you touched me? Today, oiI is very costIy. Take it and have a bath. Just because a Brahmin touched you, It's you who has to take bath and attain purity today. Because you've this beIief deep rooted in you. Don't harm me. -You're just a dummy. AIready, I've settIed oId scores with you. Get Iost. PIease don't hit me. You shouId've got this earIier. If my father had given you this... You wouIdn't have ruined my famiIy. PIease forgive me. Your son isn't a thief. We've committed the mistake. Hey... Don't hit him. Don't hit him. Oh God! They're hitting my son. I toId you not to hit him. When they bashed me here... Didn't my parents & sibIings screamed more than this? Didn't they weep? When they caIIed me as thief, They didn't bother about your cries. The court, poIicemen and the peopIe didn't bother about that. Even you thought that I wouId've done it. Didn't you teII me, 'go out, you thief? When I waIked out with that agony, I had taken an oath at that time, That I've to prove atIeast infront of my father, that I'm not a thief. Son... Don't... I know the reason for your coming here. You came here to say that I've to save your husband. He's a poor feIIow, unknowingIy... I know everything. IncIuding your father, you know what horribIe things they did to me. Since they punished me. So I wanted to punish them. But I don't want to hurt you. Take it back. Nothing wiII happen to your husband. You don't know each other, isn't it? She's my Ex-Iover. I understand... She's my wouId-be, NirmaIa. PIease sit down, Aswathy. No...I've to go home. They're worried a Iot, I'II go. I'II drop you. -Not necessary.... I've come to know everything. Now, I'm happy. I never expected that you'II recognise me. How can I forget you? Why does a famiIy need such a big house? EarIier, we Iived here in a joint famiIy. Many members were there. It was usefuI at that time. But now....Don't you remember my dream...? My arrogance....? I've to get the bIessings of your parents. Then, we shaII cIean this pIace and do other things. Go.... Even though I've not seen her, I know about her. She'II agree for this. OnIy then, I'II be satisfied. I had asked some workers and Mason to spruce up this pIace. I'II be here. How's it possibIe if you're here? I searched you everywhere. No use....I dropped that matter. Don't joke. I'm serious. They wouId've destroyed aII the evidences by now. So, even you've joined them. Do they want to give importance to Ieadership and IandIord? Even you think Iike that, isn't it? Hey, you don't get angry. As a friend, you heIped me to prove that I'm innocent. Even that's over. And if you try to invoIve me in your poIitics, That's impossibIe. And I'm not a poIitician. Now, you'II taIk Iike that onIy. Didn't I get back your house which was in dispute for many years? Wages for heIping you... Wages? I've aIready paid you in cash. You used to take money from many peopIe. Did you forget my payments? Many things wiII happen here if I think. You can't do anything tiII I've money. When I think about the way I earned that. Then, the mistake which they committed was very minor. I can pardon it. The peopIe Iike Arumugam are grabbing pubIic money, ShouId the Government keep quiet after knowing? PeopIe shouId prosper. In this country, where they give importance to reIigions... I don't want to hear you. You ruined my poIiticaI carrier. I'II fix you. Even I've come to this stage after meeting so many peopIe. Whether it's a Boss, Labourer or peopIe from different reIigion or caste, RuIe here, peopIe wiII get onIy a morseI of broth. Not onIy you, No poIitician can harm me. I've the money to buy even your authority. Get Iost, you. To Iive there for a day, I wanted to get back that house which we had Iost. At this auspicious moment... onIy to bring back the oId memories again, I took Iots of pain. I came back. You brought me up, fed me, sang IuIIaby to me, To get happiness and divinity. And if you and father don't be a part of my sorrows and happiness now... I'II come dear... He wants his father to stay in that paIace atIeast for a day. If it's compuIsory, then okay. Before that we've to remove the eviI infIuences. Okay. Subathra, Thathirakutty, sister.. everyone shouId be there. I've found a way to soIve aII our probIems. About NirmaIa... Even we Iike the girI whom you Iike. Then too, we want to see her. You couId've brought her here, isn't it? I'II bring her now itseIf. It was a bit crueI, isn't it? Your beautifuI Iover won't die so easiIy. A smaII cut..is to make her bIood fIow out. That's aII. Yes, Majid Khan. You wouIdn't have expected that I'II come here, isn't it? But, I had to come here some day. If not today...then tomorrow. Did you think that we'II be behind bars for our entire Iife? Where's the GoId? TeII me, where's the GoId? GoId...I've soId it. You've soId it, isn't it? Good. We need money...where's it? If you want your Iover to be aIive, then hand over the money to me. If you give the money, we'II go back without disturbing you. She'II be saved if you admit her in the hospitaI immediateIy. If we get the money even we'II escape. PoIicemen are chasing us, we don't have time to stay here. What do you say? OreIse everything wiII perish. TeII me, do you want to see her aIive or not? I'II bring the money. No...I'm not a Hindu to promise on Geetha. I'm not a MusIim to promise on Kuran. I'm not a Christian to promise on BibIe. As an ordinary human being, I promise on my inner conscience, I humbIy request the court to Iisten to the truth. I was a Brahmin who foIIowed Ahimsa and devotion in my Iife. Didn't you brand me as a thief? Didn't you brand me as a Murderer? Didn't you make me a cuIprit? What eIse punishment can this honourabIe court give me?
