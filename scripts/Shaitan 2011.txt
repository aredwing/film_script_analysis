'..but also for three of her friends '..who disappeared the same time as her.' 'There has been no ransom call to any of her other friends.' 'And the police are yet to confirm..' '..whether the friends are the victims or indeed the kidnappers.' There's a lot of speculation where the youngster might be hiding. The police currently traced the call.. Leave me. Brother, whom have you brought? Help! You want to put me in trouble? KC. KC. Bolt the door. Leave me. 'We now have pictures of the four missing youngsters.' 'The parents have offered reward to anyone..' ..who can provide the police with information on their whereabouts.' Leave me! Leave me! Help! Help! Do you want us killed? Let go of her. Shut up! Shut up, you witch! Leave me! Leave me! Who are you? - How can you just barge in? Leave. - Get out of here. I said get out of here. Sit down. - How dare you come inside? Sit down. Sit down. You are pointing a gun at me in front of a kid? Help! Help! Who are you? - Get out of here. Get out. - You are pointing a gun at me in front of a kid? I said sit down. Raise your hands. I told you. - Yes.. Shut up! Shut up! No. Don't you have any shame? You are pointing a gun at me in front of a kid? Get out of here. - Arvind, is everything alright? Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's go. Hey, stop. Stop right there. Go upstairs. Go upstairs. Go upstairs. Run. Run. Run. Hurry up. Run. Keep quiet. - No, get out of here. Keep quiet. - Get out of here. I said, get out. Come on, kick the door. Kick the door. I'm standing right outside the lodge where the gun fight took place. The two Kenyan nationals Omar and Tofeeq.. ..had entered the country a month ago.. ..to deliver a heavy consignment of cocaine. Both of them were being haboured by an Indian family.. ..Kadija and Mustaq Ansari, who have just been arrested. Also found dead on the spot was Germany tourist Claudia Jones.. ..who was reported missing by German embassy.. ..around four weeks ago. Her cause of death has been confirmed as a overdose of cocaine. Sir, it's like you go for a prayer and you end up fasting. Your Mumbai police was looking for Amrita Jaishankar.. ..but it got a Germany citizen missing since four weeks.. ..Claudia's dead body. What do you have to say about this? Excuse me. What do you think? That police handles only one case at a time? For us, each and every case is important. If we have Amrita's case it doesn't mean.. ..that we ignore Claudia's case. Please. Our experts' team has been investigating this case.. For the past four weeks. And what is so surprising if we find Claudia Jones? I am surprised at your behaviour. You are looking for drama even when the police has done good work. Saw how the commissioner is fooling people? So what? - What did the doctor say? I've already been shot thrice. Doctor said if I get shot again.. ..there will be no blood left in my body. Sir, where is Amrita? Doctor said that? Sandeep, crabs don't have any blood in them.. ..and cops don't have a single loyal bone. Now what you think is what you are. Did you find anything in the laptop? No. And nothing in the Facebook account as well. Except sympathy messages. About 3000 of them but nothing suspicious. Anything from the tracking device? I have diverted the phone calls of all the parents here. In about 20 minutes I will be able to crack anyone calling. Inspector. And the terrestrial tracking software which helps in.. Inspector. Yes, ma'am? - How old was that girl? Jai.. Jai, we have lost her. Jai, what am I going to do? How.. All of us kidnapped? I don't understand anything. I also don't understand. Does the hero love the milkmaid or the other item girl? Amy - Can you guys just stop it? If we don't go home for few hours.. ..does it mean that we are kidnapped? Dash. Dash. What's the plan, now? KC, your dad can solve this. Let's go back. Go back? Tanya.. What do you think? The cops are doing a striptease in the station? If we go back, they will badger each one of us.. ..where we were and what were we doing. One wrong answer and you will be thrashed in such a way.. ..that you will never forget. We don't have the money and on top of that.. ..Malwankar is sitting over our heads. We will call everyone's dads tonight. And decide the drop off point. - Okay. Why everyone's dads? Why not ask when we have the opportunity. According to the media all four of you got kidnapped, right? Then how much money will we get? Amy. - What? We will get 25 from his dad. And from Tanya's sister, perhaps 1500. All of you wait here. I'll go and make the calls. Wait. I'll come along. You stay here. Take care of them. KC. What's happening? Can't you see it? Don't you understand? What do you mean? Dash is a big bullshitter. You are agreeing to whatever he is saying. Nothing like that. Whose plan it was to kidnap someone? And now.. He is asking a ransom from everyone's dads. And why did he hit him so badly? Yes. Why did he hit him? He should have just watch me get raped, right? Just cool it, you know. Rape? What rape? You both looked like you were made for each other. Didn't you see their.. ..chemistry? Tanya. - Tanya. Stupid. Listen.. - Tanya. Zubi, go. Tanya. I'm leaving. - Look, don't take.. I'm leaving. - Don't take Amy seriously. Zubi, we.. We are all going to die. See, I.. I know I am freaking out, too. Everything will be fine. What will be fine, Zubi? I was almost raped. Reped. Zubi. Two days ago we ran over and killed two men. And in that lodge, that.. We killed that bastard. - There's no proof. I mean like, he could still be alive. What difference does it make? What difference does it make? Please, get me out of here. Please. Zubi. I cannot leave KC. You love me, right? Please, get me out of here. I want to go home, Zubi. I don't want to do this anymore. Please Zubi. Take me home. Please. Please. I'll.. ..get a cab. I'll come with you. They will suspect us if we go together. If they ask, just make up something, okay? Say that I have gone to get food or something. Okay? - Okay. Zubi, I want your phone. I want to call my sister. Please. Don't worry? We are doing the right thing. Now we need 50.. not 25 lakhs. Tomorrow 11:30am sharp. Outside the Goodluck restaurant. Lower Parel. Come alone. If you bring the police along then.. You will get the money. Balwant, who is the SI of that area? Please don't hurt Amy. Can I speak to Amy? Hello. Hello. What date is it tomorrow? Give me that. Give it back to me. I'll kill you. - Let me go. What's going on? Yes? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. The bitch was calling the cops. I was not calling the cops. Tanya. - Just stay here. I'm not going anywhere. - You were calling the cops. KC, I didn't call the cops. - Bitch. Where did you get the phone? Who gave you this phone? - Trust, huh? Where's Zubin? He is out to get food. Trust? Trust. - You bitch. Trust means shit, doesn't it? - You bitch. Who broke our trust? Everything has happened because of you, KC. Everything has happened because of you. Tanya, get up. Amy. Tanya. I hope she.. KC. Tanya. Zubin. Zubin. Which information are you talking about? - Don't shout, sir. Of course, I will shout. - No, you don't have to shout. Who is he to tell me not to shout? One by one. You think your brother will ever come back? Please. Stop it. That's enough. Please, sir. Our sources have just informed us.. Tanya Sharma has been found. Tanya Sharma has been found. Still no news on Amrita Jaishankar. Stay here till I don't return. Where are you? On second floor in the opposite building. Yes, sir, I can see him. Why did Mahabharata take place? Because Draupadi laughed. I found this audio clip in Amy's laptop. It matches with the ransom call. I'm 100% sure its Dushyant Sahu. Did our hero come to pick up the money? No I don't think he will. Tanya. Tanya, listen to me. Tanu. Tanya. Tanya. Tanya. Hello. Yes. So? So what were the others doing? Where they busy celebrating Lord Krishna's birthday? Sir, actually.. - Just a minute, Mathur. Is this a joke? It has been more than 48 hours. What have we done? We found that German girl Claudia by fluke. We had one chance but we lost that as well. There's a half dead girl lying in here.. ..who might die as I speak. Sir, I know that, but.. You don't know anything, Mathur. Is the media targeting you? They have linked everything to this case from terrorism to black magic. There is a lot of pressure on me, Mathur. I keep getting calls from my seniors. I'm repeatedly being told that they will give the case to CBI.. Sir, I'll talk to you later. - You.. Sir, we found him outside the airport. His father was sending him to Bangalore. Did he say anything? - No, sir. I want my lawyer. What did you think you are sitting in an American prison? It's my right. Only the police are right during an interrogation. No one will come to know even if I bump you off in an encounter. Got it? Now tell me, where are the rest of your friends? Otherwise, along with you, your parents, too, won't get a lawyer. Tell me. Okay, don't tell me. I'll book you for Tanya's murder. You killed Tanya, didn't you? No, sir. I didn't. You killed Tanya, didn't you? - No, sir. I didn't. Never I had told them I don't want to be a part of this. They.. I got scared, sir. I got scared. Look, you couldn't save Tanya. But you can save yourself trust me. Trust a cop? All this has happened because of a cop. What do you mean? Let us pray. Almighty God, whose blessed son bears our grief.. ..and carries our sorrows, grant faith and courage.. ..to all who are suffering at this time. And give your strength and blessing.. ..to those who seek to help them. Through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. Amy.. Someone must have taken her to the hospital, right? Amy, you think she's okay? I think I should call her. Yes, I'll call her. No.. No one will believe that it was an accident, KC. I know how it works. That's the way it works. No one believed my mother either. They just locked her up. They are going to lock us up, too. Once we get the money.. Then.. then.. then.. Then we should leave. Yes. Then we have to get out of here. We have to leave. We'll go to LA. For a few days I'll request them to let my mom out. You can meet my mom. What crap are you ranting? - Her eyes are so beautiful. she paints so well. You have to see her paintings. - What happened? She's amazing. I didn't get the money. Cops all around. Dash, don't lie. Where's the money? Where's the money? Your dad had made all the arrangements. I would've got caught if I had gone to take the money. It would have been better if you would've got caught. What? Move. No. - Where are you going? I'm hungry. I'm going to get some food. From our department? - Yes, sir. Zubin is telling the truth. all rascals cooking up a story. It's part of the plan blame a cop. Mathur, I am not getting emotional.. ..because Malwankar or whoever he is, is a cop. While sitting here, I know whose uniform gets ironed where. Please, sir. Listen to me. - Mathur. Enough is enough. Enough is enough indeed. You solve this case and get yourself transferred. Listening to a kid you are acting insane.. I'ts not nonsense im not getting instigated by a kid, sir. I've been trying to tell you since long you are not getting me. I've done my background check, sir. Sorry won't be able to do this. Sir. Sir, Pratham has called in. The phone number given by Zubin Shroff belongs.. ..to some Gauri Malwankar. Patel, keep in mind that he shouldn't find out.. ..that we know about him. - Swine. No one will send a message to the wireless. I've already given a message to the wireless. With whose permission? With whose.. Sorry. Sandeep, let's go. Let's go. Gopi must be on his way back from school. Where are you going? Have your lunch. I'll be back in an hour. Gauri Malwankar? - Okay? Shut up. I said shut up. He shouldn't find out. Where were you?

Please go away. Watchman. Watchman. Take them out of here. Giving us a lot of trouble. You have a phone in here? The news is confirmed. Malwankar last called from a public booth in Vasai. And Karan Chaudhary just called his father.. asked him to come to a church in Vasai. Any contact from his dad? No, his phone is off. Leave. I'll meet you in Vasai. Vasai. - I won't go to Vasai, sir. Ofcourse you will. No! Mom! Mom! - Amy. Mom! - Amy. Look at me. I have to go get mom. - Amy. Listen to me. Listen to me. Where's the money? Give me the money. I'll give you back the money. Please.

You called him? - No.. Amy, please. Come on, Amy. - I don't.. With whose permission did you call him? Do I need your permission to call my dad? Amy. Amy, come on, let's go. We were deciding everything together, right? What happened now? - Now I have decided. Amy Let's go. No one will go anywhere. Malwankar is not answering his phone. Enough of planning. Until now it was all your plan, right? Is it working? Whose plan was it to kidnap oneself? Whose plan was it to hide in Bhindi Bazaar? Whose plan was it to come here? Amy, come on, let's go. Please. Dash. Dash. Dash. We can fix this, okay? I know my dad. He loves me. He loves me a lot, okay? He must have paid up Where have you hidden it? Where have you hidden it? - Just shut up, Amy. Your dad hates you, okay? Had he loved you he would've quietly paid the money. And you.. You can leave if you want to. She won't go anywhere. Come on, Amy. You will hit me? Come on, Amy. - No. Let's go, Amy. Let's get out of here. It was my plan. My plan. Who is in there? Open the door! Open the door! People have gathered outside. Come with me. I have to go and get mom. Amy, come with me. - I have to get mom. Amy. - I have to go and get mom. Your mother is dead. Do you wish to die as well? Come with me. Just get up. No! She's not dead! - Shut up. Who is in there? Come on, run. Move. Amrita Jaishankar has been found. The kidnappers of this high profile kidnapping case.. ..finally lost their lives at God's abode. Amrita bravely fought with her kidnappers. After a 48 hour ordeal ..the girl is now safe with her parents. Mathur, there is a difference between the fact and the truth. Mathur, the truth is its the duty of every cop.. ..to selflessly serve his nation. But the fact remains in a salary of 8500.. ..he has to look after his family, serve his nation.. ..and be loyal, selflessness goes for a toss. One person is responsible for all this. Malwankar. It's true. But the fact is to save the face of the entire police force.. ..this case has to be suppressed. You've to decide.. ..whether you will go with truth or fact. Amrita fought bravely with her kidnappers.. ..and just about managed to escape. The other victims Tanya Sharma and Zubin Shroff.. ..are also in safe custody now. While it was earlier reported that.. ..one of her friends Dushant Sahu might have been.. ..involved in the kidnapping. At this point we cannot confirm this. I, Tanya Sharma.. I, Zubin Shroff.. In my sound mind, and without any pressure from anyone.. ..accept that we were not a part of Amrita Jaishankar's kidnapping. Like us, Karan Chaudhary and Amrita Jaishankar, too.. ..became victims of this conspiracy. This entire incident was planned by Dushyant Sahu. Wherever possible we tried our best to stop our friend Dusyhant. All four of us claim to be innocent in this incident. Yours' sincerely, Tanya. Operation 'Amrita Missing' has coming to an end. During this case Inspector Malwankar.. ..who was investigating this case.. ..has been seriously injured. Malwankar.. Look carefully at this bed, this wall and this ward. Because you will be coming back here, soon. Not because of what you have done. But because I won't let the years of hard work.. ..of the police force go down the drain. I'm sorry, sir. Sir. Sir.. Sir.. I am.. Mathur. Thanks a lot. Thanks. What is your name, my child? Saira. Amy. Saira Jaishankar.
