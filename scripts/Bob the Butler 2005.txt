[Boom!] - Ahhh! - Give your Uncle Bob another chance. - Bob, you're no uncle and I'm no mama. Cute names are company policy, that's all! Just feel-good stuff so they can pay you less. - But we're family! Look around! - UH! - Ohhhh! - Dad! - Ahhhhh! - You okay? - Dad! We're family! - This is my real father, Bob! There's a difference! [Sirens wailing] Time was drifted This rock had got to roll So I hit the road and made my getaway Restless feeling Really got a hold - Sorry! I started searching for a better way But I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night But I couldn't see the light No, no, no, stop, stop, stop! [Honking] Ahhhhh! To take me through the night I couldn't get it right - Help! Help! I couldn't get it right - Grab on to this rope here! Pull it. Ahhhh! L.A. Fever Made me feel alright Ah! But I must admit it got the best of me Hi, people. Getting down so deep I could have drowned Oh, save the fishes! Save the fishes! Now I can't get back the way I used to be But I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night But I couldn't see the light no I couldn't see the light [monkey screeching] To take me through the night-ight-ight Couldn't get it right I'm an astronaut, I'm a ballerina! I'm an astronaut, I'm a ballerina! [Babies crying] Shave, shave, shave... - Ahhhh! - Sorry. New York City Took me with the tide And I nearly died from hospitality Left me stranded Took away my pride Just another no-account fatality Ahhhh! - Oh. Looking for a sign in the middle of the night But I couldn't see the light No I couldn't see the light - Huh, I'm gonna need a bigger board. It's not a big deal, Rascal. We're only on the Bs, remember. [Rascal squeaking] Got all this to go. Okay, so we did burger assistant. Next up, we have... business consulting. Butcher? [Loud squeaking] Oh, whoa. Hey, listen to this. Listen. "Cosmopolitan Butler School Become part of a family in 5 days" Rascal, [squeaking] We're going butling. [Scooter backfires repeatedly] - Do you think you canna be a Lassie? - Nine-thirty? [Whistle blowing] - Good morning, students. [All]: Good morning, sir. - Two lines, please. Chop, chop! My name is Butler. I'm a born butler in all senses of the phrase. I come from a long line of butlers. In only five days, you will each receive a certificate of competence to wait on any family on this side of the pond. For those that are interested, the full English course lasts a further 17 years. Standards are slightly higher. So, what does a butler... do? Hmm? Answer: Everything. He must cook, clean, tend the garden, groom the horses, write letters, iron shirts. Arrange appointments, greet guests, run baths, buy groceries, pack cases, unpack cases, make reservations, cancel reservations and still find time to be a confidant. Understood? [All]: Yes, sir. - Yes, sir! - Grooming is crucial to the role. Substantial facial hair is quite unacceptable. Rabbi, how would you serve soup? - But really... - It goes, or you go. - Oh. - Butlers must be immaculately dressed. So what's your excuse, you miserable heap of mess? - This is me tidy. - Not in my book. Do you possess any offensively tasteless tattoos perpetrated in a drunken haze? - No. - Any piercings of body parts? - I do have a series of small holes in my tongue from when I was six. My cousin, he gave me a black-sea-urchin thing and told me it was a chocolate muffin. [Man stifling laughter] I think they've... grown over. - Show me your nipples. [Man stifled laughter] - My nipples? - Yes, your nipples. Hmm... You can't blame a man for asking. Frankly, you look the weird sort. - I'm weird? - Come on, come on! Tess! Tess! This elevator has already left. Ssstop that! You're causing a delay. - I have an important meeting. - If was so important, you would've left earlier, like I did. - Mother, you're embarrassing us. - Stop. - Ow. Witch! - That's a rude person. - Suck-up. - Any news, Judith? - Not yet. - Okay. Kate. All right, go. - Mr. Dickens called. Urgent. - Skip. Next. Next, the investment conference call. Urgent. - Save. Next. - Jacques called about dinner on Monday. - Confirm. Eight o'clock. - It's them. - Okay. Put 'em through. - Good luck. - A word or two about money. Money makes the world go round, doesn't it? [All]: Yes, Mr. Butler. - Balderdash. Trust, not money. That's what makes the world go round. If I haven't been able to produce at least one trustworthy butler out of this course, then I've wasted my time. - Ah-ah! Sorry. Sorry! - As I've made clear, you will be in complete control of the household. However, you will be treated by all other members of the household as if you were slightly less significant than a piece of used toilet paper. To simulate this, I've devised a rather amusing little exercise. - You're enjoying this, aren't you? - I'm getting no pleasure from it whatsoever! - Yeah, right. - Bull'seye! - Now, look, open wide for one teeny, weeny little baked bean, or I'll tell your mom. - But I'll tell her you hit me. - What?! - I'll tell her you hit me and pulled my hair. Ahhhhh! - Okay, leave the friggin' food. - You swore! You swore in front of my little brother. Can I watch MTV tonight? - I will not be blackmailed by you children. [Screaming] - Mrs. Withington, what happened?! - Sorry, Miss Jamieson, but they are the devil's seed! - Oh, no, they're just playing with you. They're delightful children, really. Undemeath all the horrible stuff. Please, I promised Jacques I would not let him down again. - Ho-ho! - Ah! Babysitters... [phone ringing] - Hello? - Bob the Babysitter? - No, ma'am. This is Bob the Butler. - Now, look. I definitely have this number down for Bob the Babysitter. - Well, that was at least seven jobs back. - But you were a babysitter once? - Well, yes. Ahem. Just once. - Oh, please, this is an emergency. - One minute, please. Rascal, damsel in distress. May I have your leave? [Squeaking] Thank you, Master Rascal. I'd be happy to. - Oh... my. Are you Bob? - At your service. - You-you have a piece of tomato in your hair. - Oh. - Ew. - Gone. - Okay, well, um, I want you to meet my children. This is my daughter, Tess. - Miss Tess. Hello. Lovely name. - My son, Bates. - Mm. Master... Bates. Also lovely. - Gross. - What's gross? - Okay. Have to go, so do me a favour and... do not hurt him. Bob, please don't sit on any of the nice chairs unless you have to. - Okay. - What's gross? - Never mind. Good night, children. - Good night, Mother. Enjoy your romantic evening out. Have fun! - Don't forget the back ones, Master. - Why do you call me Master? - I'm studying to be a butler. - I don't like it. Master Bates. It just feels wrong. - Indeed. How about I call you Bates? - I like that. - Yeah, just Bates. - Mm-hmm. - Miss Tess? - Uh! [Sniffing] - Oh, no. Not again. Water. Water! Quick, quick, quick, quick...! Oh, no. Hmm. Mm... Nice chair. - Bates. You awake? - When will Mom be back? - I think Bob's a real find. He's so stupid, he didn't even tell me off for smoking. - Smoking kills. I read it. - Sisters kill too, so keep your mouth shut. - He let me sleep in my fireman costume. - He's crazy. - I like him more than Mrs. Withington. - Would you like to have him back? - Can we? - Leave it to me. - Thanks for a lovely evening. - Ah, the pleasure was all mine. - I'd invite you up - I know, the children will up as usual. [Anne laughing] - Omigod! - What? What's wrong? - The children's lights are all out! What's wrong? - Nothin'. They've been good as gold. - Oh, cut the BS. What, are they bound and gagged somewhere? - You really should be congratulated, ma'am, on raising such wondrous progeny. Can I go now? - Uh, normally, they're, uh... a pain in the derriere. I think here you say "brats." - Well, I never say "brats." - Well, I don't know what you did, but I'm impressed. Jacques, will you pay Bob for me? - Of course! [Chortling] I'm, uh... tipping you very generously here. I want you to know why. Tonight, with the kids in bed, all night, I get to do what Frenchmen love to do most... - You gonna look in the mirror for eight hours? Thanks, Jack. - This moming, those of us that remain will address the basic skills required for a typical day, starting with undressing the master. Now, I shall need a volunteer. Mr. Tree, if you please. Jacket. Tie. Waistcoat. The vest, to you. Shirt. - Ah, come on, haven't you got some kind of dummy? - Dear boy, if you intend to be a butler, you better get used to naked old flesh. - You sure this isn't a British thing? I mean, most Americans know how to dress themselves. - On the contrary. We are here to educate them to do it better. And to dress for the right occasion. - Whoa! Yo, I'm outta here. - Well, Bob, you seem to be the last one left. - Mr. Butler, I don't really know if this is necessary. I mean... I'll give 100 bucks if you leave the rest on. One-hundred and fifty. A thousand! Please stop there. - Right. Mr. Tree, let's get cracking, then. Dress me. [Door chiming] - Bob, no! Nuh-uh. - It's okay. It's okay, Nico. I don't wanna work here. I can't stand the sight of blood. All that screaming. - You took the guy's earlobe off. - Not on purpose. Ah! - You used to work here? - Of course I used to work here. "Barber" comes before "butler" in the Yellow Pages. - So how do you like it? - Neat and tidy. - As the man says. - No beard. - No beard? - Butlers don't have beards. - Butlers wear beards. - No beard. - Abit of beard. - No beard at all. - Itty-bit of beard? - No beard whatever. - Itsy-bit of beard? - No. Not even a little bitty-bitty-bitty- weeny-bitty beard. - Itty-bit of butler beard? - Beardless. - Itty-bit of butler beard? - No beard! - Itty-bit of butler beard, itty-bit of butler beard, itty-bit of butler bear. Settled. - So? - Well, pretty much as it is. - What do you expect to do, Bob, if this doesn't work out? - I'll probably move on to the Cs. You know? Camping guide, carpet cleaner, carwasher, computer hacker. - Extraordinary. You seem to have such faith in yourself... where none is justified. - Thanks, Mr. Butler. - Well, well, well. Agentleman's gentleman, by George! - Loving breaths... of deep... [inhaling deeply] ...acceptance. - All right, can we speed it up, please? Look - ahem - here's my needs analysis. I think it'll save time. - What are you saving time for? Yourfamily? But you don't even have time to enjoy your kids. Or Jacques. - Jack's not family. - There's too much work. I need more time. - Remember your mantra. - "I cannot organize the world... blah-blah-blah." - Maybe you could work just as hard and find someone who brings the best out of me and Bates. - Tess, that is a very sensible suggestion. Do you have anyone in mind? - Not really. - Well... I quite like the babysitter we had last night. - But Tess said he was freaky. - He's too strict. - He's way too strict. - Definitely not him. - Uh-uh. - Well, it's not your call, children. [Wind blowing] - What are we doing? - Come on, come on, come on. Up you get. Standing still, Mr. Tree, is highly prized in butler circles. - Freak. - Just get up. - Tiny people down below... - Good. I want you to clear your mind and relax. - Relax? You kidding me? I'm standing inches from certain death here. - I'll tell you what, think of the most beautiful thing you've seen in the last 48 hours. - Other than your ass? - Now come on. You can do it. I'm beginning to have faith in you, Bob. - Okay, I've got it. - What is it? - It's a woman. - Can you picture her? - Yes. - Excellent. Hold that thought. - Hey, kiddo, how was your day? - Okay. - Just okay? Mine was pretty good. Do you wanna hear about it? - Does it have anything to do with capital management? - Yes. - No. [Slurping sound] It's polite to knock. - It's bedtime, sweetheart. - I haven't finished. - Now. Please? - No. - Ah, that's just what I need. Thank you. Do you wanna hear about my day? - Now? Your mind is full of work and kids, work and kids, work and kids. That leaves little for me. - I am trying to sell my business, Jacques. - For months, ma chrie. But when? - I'm thinking of hiring Bob. - The babysitter? - The butler. - The children will live with him? I'm joking. - No, he'll live in the attic. We'll have a babysitter wheneverwe want. - Perfect. [Knocking] - Can you hurry up in there? You've been in there for hours. - Almost finished. - You'll tidy all this up? - Yeah. - Bates, stop that! - Ah! - It's a toilet bidet. - What's a toilet bidet? - It's like a fountain for your ass... - Ask me later. - Jack says he's here. - The butler! Now then, Robert - Actually, my name's Bob. - Oh, well, Bob is short for Robert. - Isn't Rob short for Robert? - Yes. - So then Bob would be short for Bobert. - Your name is Bobert? - No. Just Bob. - Okay, then. As long as we're satisfied with first names, can we continue? - Of course. Though I don't know your name. Is it all right if I call you Mistress Jamieson? - No. That sounds rather sordid, doesn't it? Perhaps you could just call me Anne. - Anne. - Just Anne. - Anne. - Yes. Anne. - Et bien? - Anne. - Mr. Tree, how many children do you have? - Well, I don't have any children. - But you said in the flyer that you would take care of the children like your own. - Yeah, if I had some. Ahem. - But you did just recently attend the Cosmopolitan Butler School? - Is all tidy. - Uh, how much do I owe you? What did he say? - Uh, he said he'll drop the bill off next week. - Um - ahem - Jacques got me a wonderful present: A state-of-the-art toilet. - A toilet? What a nice gift. [Speaking Japanese] - My goodness, Bob, I had no idea that you were fluent in Japanese. - I worked in the Asian market. - Well, that's impressive. - You sold stock? - Stalks, vegetables, some strangely shaped fruits. Horseshoe-shaped... fruits. - Uh, Bob, I would like to go over a few specifics. I colour-categorize my sponges. - Hmm? - Blue for bathroom, yellow for kitchen, purple for general, green for the outdoors, car included. Please don't confuse them. - Fine. - No strange women in the house. - Fine. - No drugs. No pets. - Fine. - You allergic? - They're unhygienic. - Fine. - So what do you think? - He is very strange. - So what do you think? - He is very strange. I don't understand this Rob-Bob-Bobert business. - Well, I suppose we could always interview other candidates. - There are other candidates? - No. I hired an assistant once. She seemed perfect, she worked hard, she did everything I told her to. One lunchtime, I saw her in the gym. She had a shower and then changed right back into herworkout bra. - I'm lost. - I fired her on the spot, of course. - You fired her because of her sweaty bra? Do you think Bobert wears a bra? - Oh, who knows. But if it doesn't work out, I'll change him. - Okay. - Ah... Bates! - Sorry, Mom. - I think you'll find everything you need. I'm sure it's not up to your professional standards. - It's... white. - Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry it is such a mess. [Singing]: I can indeed organize the world [squeaking] - Hey, Rascal. Home. We are robots! We are monster robots! I am Robot Man! Get out of my way. I am Computer Man... - Aren't you a little old to play with toys? - Well, I don't usually play with them, but... I got these when about your age and... I figured I'd give them to my own son one day. - Didn't he want them? - Ahem. The children are in bed, ma'am. - Oh, thank you, Bob. Music to my ears. - Is there anything else I can do for you? - No. Thank you. I'll see you in the morning. - I hope you don't mind, but, um, I couldn't find any towels for your bathroom. - Mm, no. I don't use them. - Okay, then. - They breed germs. I have a body-dryer. - A body-dryer? - Yes. - Like a hairdryer? - Bigger. Much more hygienic. Did I mention the sponge system? Blue for the bathroom... - Purple, yellow, green. - Oh. Well, good night, then. - Good night. [Sniffing] [Sniffing] [Whistling] - What's that smell? - Cooking. - Real food? - Well, I guess Bob made us breakfast. Where did you get that blouse? - It's an old one. - Yeah, like really old. Like five years tool old. It's way too small for you. - Is not. - Is. - Is not. - Let's have Bob decide. Bob? [Bob singing] - Is not. - Is. - Yes, ma'am? - Tess's blouse - indecently small, or acceptable fashion? - Sorry, Miss Tess. - That's a lot of pancakes. - It's more cost-effective to prepare in bulk. - They teach you that bulk stuff at butler school? - Actually, at the finest... the finest cooking school in the world. - The Cordon Bleu. - The U.S. Army. - The army? Cool. - Would you like some pancakes, Miss Tess? - Sure, make me out on 50 pounds. That'll make me popular. - Getting grounded for being rude will definitely make you popular. - Miss Tess, I wanna prepare a special dinner tonight. Sort of an introduction. What does your mother like? - She likes anything she can eat quickly so she can get back to work. - You know what'd be good? Aluau. She loves the whole Hawaiian thing. - A luau, huh? - Pork? - Okay, I'll look into that. I knew a guy once, he was kind of a nervous fellow. Used to bite his nails. One day, he was so upset, he ate his whole hand. - He did not. - By the time we pulled him off, he'd chewed all the way up to the elbows. - That is stupid. - That fellow has to wear a muzzle now. A muzzle. All because he couldn't talk about his problems. I don't know about that outfit, Miss Tess. Are you getting out? - I've got basketball today. - That's great. I love basketball. - You're not underfourfoot. Ah... - Hey. - Hi. Guess what. - You joined the Britney Spears fan club? - My mom hired a butler. - He looks like he's from Transylvania. - He's not the only one. [Laughing] - They remind me of the Addams Family. [Laughing] - Sad, sad, sad. [Baby crying] - Helloooo. Hellooooo. Hellooooo. Ahem. Nice melons. - Thank you. Nice cucumber. - Thanks. - You. [Whispering] - You. - You. - You. - You. - You. - You. [Blowing whistle] [Beep] [Music playing] [Music playing louder] [Beep] - Ah! Ladies you're damn right Can't read a man's mind We're living in two tribes and heading for war Whoo! Nobody's perfect We all gotta work it but fellas we're worth it So don't break the law ah ah ah ah I'm just a love machine feeding my fantasy Give me a kiss or three We just need a squeeze instead of this negligee What will the neighbours think This time come take my hand Understand that you can You're my man and I need you tonight Come make my dreams honey hard as it seems Loving me is as easy as pie I'm just a love machine Feeding my fantasy give me a kiss or three Ooh, yeah. - Hi. - How ya doin'? - Good. - Where's your sister? - I don't know. Her cool friends are very sensitive. - She have a lot of friends? - Compared to me, or to normal people? - Tess said she'd rather die than be collected by a man who looks like a penguin. - I only take random insults from immediate friends and family. - I'm Tess's best friend. - Good enough. Where is she? - Waiting for you to leave over cover of nightfall. - Thank you. Miss Tess! Tess Jamieson! Your butler is here and waiting! Hurry up, or I'll throw out yourfavourite Bamey video! And your stash of letters to one J. Timberlake! So how'd basketball go? - I stunk. What's you expect? - I dunno. What did you expect? - Well, I thought I'd be lousy. - Well, then it all worked out the way you thought. Miss Tess, how was your day? - Do you gamble? - What do you got in mind? - I bet you'll be fired within a week. - What odds are you offering? Doesn't anyone want to sit up front with the luau dinner? [Hawaiian music playing] [Bob humming] Dinner is served! - This is so perfect. - You think she'll like it? - She'll be breathless. It's a napkin, moron. - Why the hurry? - He made us all dinner. The least we can do is show him a little gratitude. [Gasping] Oh, my good God. Aluau. Who's idea was this? - The butler. - One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, five Mississippi, six Mississippi, seven Mississippi, nine Mississippi, 10 Mississippi! - Mm, rich, full-bodied... Hmm, I smell a hint of mushroom. - Shitake? - Portobello. Burgundy region. I will take you there one day. - Can I come to Verdungy? - Oh, Bates, sweet, but it's not for les enfants. [Bob whimpering] I think it will be a trip just for your mother and me. - Jacques is joking. Heh-heh. Of course we can all go together. The children would love it. - Ah, the children. Of course. - Can we go, Mom? Just the three of us? Jackass doesn't have to come. - Jackass? Who is Jackass. [Anne "laughing"] - I think that Bates has an imaginary friend. - Madam... kalua pu'a. The custom is to prepare the food in a an imu, or underground oven. - Sounds... wonderful. Doesn't it, children? [Gasping] [Tess]: Gross. [Anne whimpering] - It is normally served with a mashed taro root, or poi. - God! - Plug it! Plug it up! Ah! Ahh! - Hot piggy! Hot piggy! Oh, Lord. Stay with me! Stay with me! [Bates and Anne screaming] [Screaming] [All screaming] - I cannot organize the world, I cannot organize the world... [boom!] Oh... - I think you'll find that I just won the bet. - Moi. I'm the Jackass. Jacques-ass. I'm not stupid, Anne. Is he not Bob-ass, this butler? - Oh, I'm so sorry. Here, let me help you. - Imbecile! But no, you do not want to check his references! - I just wanted to make a nice dinner. Sort of a thank-you? - Well, maybe if I talk to Mom. Would that help? - Nah. I'm the screw-up. I've done this before. - You blew up another pig? - Bedtime, Bates. - Good luck. - Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you right now? - Yes. - Okay. I'm listening. - Can I have till tomorrow morning? - This is a complete disaster area! My pristine dining room is covered in pig shrapnel! - I'll clean it up. - You better. - Every... shred. - Oh, and, Bob, I think it's best if you never, ever... ever cook anything again. - Yes, ma'am. [Knocking] Thought you should know - Closed door, big hint. ...I'm staying. - I thought servants were meant to be seen and not heard. - Hey, these are great. - Hey! Gimme that! It's private! - Don't get your knickers in a knot. - Look, look, look, look, look, look, look. Look. - Okay. [Laughing] Take your time today There's no hurry you can wait a while If only for a smile Take your time today There's no hurry - All right! - There you go! You can wait a while Oh! If only for a smile Oh! Jeez! Ahhh! - Sorry! So have you decided Hmm? Uh-huh. To change your worn-out mind Then take your time today There's no hurry You can wait a while [cellphone ringing] - Hello? Hi, Mom. I'm in a tree. [Laughing] - Miss Tess. - There you go. - Bates, there you are. - Thanks! - Nice hat. Take your time today - Five in a row. Right back. [Humming] - Shoot some balls with me? - Sure. - What's that? - What? - Have you got a remote-control ball? - Rascal? - Who's Rascal? - Rascal! Rascal! Rascal! Rascal! Rascal! [Screaming] Rascal!!! - Bob!!!! Bob! Bob! Bob, stop! - Rascal!!! - Poor thing. Someone's been a very naughty butler. [Rascal squeaking] - Oh... [squeaking] Oh... Oh, Rascal. Rascal. "He licked the jar right out of Newton's hand, sliming his palm "with a streak of black gob, "perhaps the most disgusting thing Newton had experienced "since the time he mistakenly ate a maggot. - Hi, guys. How was your day? Anything interesting happen? - The usual. - Oh. - Why aren't you a dad? - Just didn't happen yet. - I don't have a dad. - Everybody has a dad. - Mom got me and Bates from a bank. - Tess. - Special bank where men make deposits. - Tess... - And women make withdrawals. - If they can't find Mr. Right. [Trumpet being played off-key to music] - Bob. Bob! - Too loud? - Uh, no. No. Just, uh... just really... really horrible. Heh-heh. - I love the trumpet. - Then you should practice. - Yeah. - Um... Bob, you must... think I'm a really horrible mother. - No. - Well, it wasn't an easy decision. - Sure. - I just... I didn't wanna miss out, you know? It's not like time was exactly on my side, so I thought I'd... - Anne... You're... you're blessed. Sorry. I, uh... spoke out of turn. Zip! - That's all right. Thank you. - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah... - What's capital management? [Laughing] - Bye! Thanks for the lift! - See you later! - Bye-bye! [Cellphone ringing] Hello, Judith. I'll be about an hour or so. It can wait. Yeah. I'll be on my cellphone if you need me. Okay. Bye. Oh! [Car alarm ringing] Ah! Oh... Well, I can't come to a meeting with stains on my blouse, now can I? I'm back, Bob! I'm just gonna take a quick bath! I'll be there as soon as I can. [Music playing] I'll be over at 10 They tell me time and again I can't wait... Why do you build me up Build me up Buttercup baby - Ahhhhhh! ...let me down... - Can I get you some towels, ma'am? - Mm-hmm!!! But I love you still I need you I need you more than anyone darling You know that I have From the start So build me up Buttercup Don't break my heart - You don't get that flipping burgers. - Then I dribbled right, cut left and slam-dunked it. - Who traded in my geek brother for a jock geek brother? - Hey, where are you all going on a Sunday? - Basketball tryouts. - Well, I'll drive you. Let me get my purse. - I wanna go with Bob. - Okay. Uh... what about you, Tess? - I arranged to meet Sophie. Don't you have work to do? - Nope. Amazingly. All right, well... see you later. [Cellphone ringing] - Ah, oui, all? Anne! What's wrong? - I got the whole day free and I'm lonely! [Sighing in contentment] It's so nice to do something for myself for a change. - We go out and find a nice, quiet place. - Oh, this is lovely! This is nice! Now this is relaxing. This... Take me home. - What?! - I... I... I can't be here without them. I just can't enjoy... myself without the kids. I mean, you know, I just can't! - Let's go! - Look, Jacques, I have children. I love them. They're not just going to disappear. - You would prefer that I disappear? Examine the situation. One: You are a single woman. Very beautiful, true, but, uh, very, very... anal. - Anal. I'm anal. - Two: Your children. They are not beautiful. Just annoying. Three: If I go... - I'll take three. You go. Now. Take a cab. - Anne! You are a single woman of a certain age. You will not find another man. Statistically, you have a better chance of being hit by a truck. One driven by Bob. - So? - So what? - How'd it go? The tryouts. - There was no tryouts. The coach had already decided who was on the team. - What? That's not fair. Wait here. - You're not going to embarrass me? - You bet I am. [Military-style music] Hey! You the coach? - Who's asking? - My name's Tree. - Bob? Bob the mascot? - Jerry? - Yeah!!! Rrrrrrr! - Yeah. What happened to the Bismark Barbarians? - Ah, I left not long after the owner fired you. He was a real a-hole. - I know. I know. I know. - Still got your helmet, though. You wanna see it? - You bet. It's about Bates. Bates Jamieson? - Pull up a chair. - Uh-ooh. - Put it on. - Yeah. Still fits like a glove. Areally... weird glove. - It took them two hours to remove that from his buttocks. - I probably shouldn't have left it on his chair. Ahem. - So what about the Jamieson kid? - He wants to try out for the team. - He's kind of small. Why is it impossible to say no to you? [Both]: Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! - Yeah! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! All right. [Blowing whistle] - Go ahead. Come on, Bates! He's a little nervous. Put one in the net there, Bates! Put one in the net there! How ya doin'? - Coach hates me. - Forget about him, okay? It's just you and me. Just like at home. Come on. Come on, let's go! - Ah... - Come on! Like we practiced! Come on! - Hey. - Oh, you got it, you got it. Take it around me, take it around me, take it around me, put it in, put it in the net. Come on. No fancy stuff. Just put it in the net. All right! Huh?! Huh?! - Yeah!!! I got one!!! - Two points! Two points! Hey, Tess. Been shopping? Oh, what is that, a wristband? Pair of socks? [Bates]: Mom!!!!!! - Is it a bib? - Hey, how were the tryouts? - Great! - Good. I made salmon skewers. - Salmon? - I'll tell Tess. - What? - Hey, Tess. - Don't come in. - Your mother made a barbecue. - I'll be down in five. [Bob humming] - Would you like to join us, Bob? Please. We'd like you to. - Thank you. It's real nice of you to have made these salmon skewers. Isn't it, kids? And a green salad. [Bates]: Eh... - That was delicious. - I should've made hot dogs. - No, no. It was really good. - Oh, you missed a spot. - Where? - Right there. - Hmm. You know, Tess has drawn some amazing dress designs. You should see her schoolbooks. - Schoolbooks? - Yeah, she draws in her schoolbooks. - You're such a liar! You're such a stupid liar! - Tess! - It's not true! I hate you, Bob! - Tess! Tess! - I guess that's what it's like having family, Rascal. [Squeaking] - Ups and downs. [Knocking] Just a second. Come in. - Hi. I've spoken to Tess and she's shown me her drawings. You're right. They're amazing. So thank you for that. - Something wrong? - Don't take this the wrong way, Bob. You're the butler. You're not herfather. - I understand completely. - Thanks. Good night, then. - Good night. - Why are we eating in here? - More coffee, ma'am? - Oh, I'll get it. - Please, ma'am. Leave it to me. - It's cool. - New skirt? - Yeah. Like it? - No. It's like theirs. - That's the point, stupid. - So you coming to watch me get my nose pierced? - Not on this planet. Tomorrow after school, okay? [School bell ringing] - Bye. - You're hanging with the Clone Barbies now? - Maybe when I'm in tighter, I'll put in a good word for you and you can hang with. - I liked you because I thought you were an individual. Like me. Now you're just more like pathetic. - Stop! Excuse me. Kate, is the fruit washed? Judith, did you wash the fruit? - It's pre-washed. - Pre-washed? Pre-washed?! - Pre-washed. - Ah! I do not wanna to lose this deal because one of my investors has the runs! - The runs? - Done. Done. Done! [Squeaking] Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! [Screaming] Arodent! Oh! Rodent! Huge rodent! - Where is he? - Oh! Oh! Huge! - Rascal? - Rat! Ratty! - Rascal, don't do this to me. - Furry thing on the table! He was there on the table! - Hold it! - Ah! What are you doing, Bob? - Don't move. - Ah... What are you doing, Bob? [Squeaking] Ah... ah... ah... Ahhhh! [Screaming] - Rascal... [cellphone ringing] - Oh, Jesus. I guess this is urgent? - Of course it's urgent! - Stay calm, Anne. Do not explode. - Too late! I've already exploded! I've dumped Jacques and kicked out the hamster. - What hamster? - Oh, keep up! Bob's taken over. He spends more time with my kids- - Than you do? - Than butling. It's exasperating! - Have you fired him? - I told him the hamster has to leave immediately and I want this whole house disinfected from top to bottom! - Oh, sounds like someone has a crush. - Huh! I'm paying you for this? I'm not paying you for this! Don't you dare bill me for this call! Ridiculous! - Oh, Rascal. [Squeaking] Who let you out? You know what, Tess? That was out of order. And if I was your father, you would be in so much trouble. Ya dig? - It wasn't me. - Yeah, whatever. - Whatever. - Bates... was it you? C'mon, Bates, why? C'mon. Talk to me, buddy. - I didn't make the team. - You didn't. Okay. That's a shame. - I didn't make the team! You said I would! - Well, I never said that. I said I would help. I said I would try. - I wasn't good enough. - Not being good enough is... life. But you'll find you're good at something. Everybody's good at something. - What are you good at? - I can catch grapes in my mouth. - Mom? I put Rascal in your room. I didn't make the team. - Okay. - It doesn't matter, though. I'll find something to be good at. - Hello, Mr. Butler? Bob here. You'll look after him? [Squeaking] - Of course. - Can I make you a cup of tea? - Oh, we have a regular little butler. What's your name, Master? - It's Bates. Just Bates. - Hmm... - You're gonna be just fine. - It's like an initiation thing. - I'll start your room. [Banging] How's everything going? - Fine, thanks! Let's go. - You got the stuff? - No problem. [Alarm ringing] - Security! - Ah! No! Let me go! You guys, wait! - Purple. Purple for general. - What? - Purple for general, yellow for kitchen, blue for bathroom. Purple for general. - Right. [Phone ringing] - Hello? Hey, Bob! It's for you. - Hello. Jamieson family butler speaking. I'll be right there. I have to go. Will you be okay with Mr. Butler for a while? - Sure. - Come on, Bates. When we're finished here, I'll teach you how to polish silver by spitting on it. - Cool! - Yeah! [Military-style music] - Hey! I'm looking for Tess Jamieson. - Tough love. We give kids a dose of reality, scare 'em straight before it's too late. - This one's not like that. - You're one of those always-looking-for-the-best - in-people guys? Hmm! We'll keep her for an hour or two, then you can take her. - Listen, if I may be so bold, you'll let her out this second. Or I'll call my friend Judge Sharma and I'll have your ass kicked from here to Texas. Don't worry about it. This'll be our little secret. - Bob, I'm sorry. About everything. I lied. About the luau. My mom's practically a vegetarian. - I guess she is now. Come on, let's go. - Omigod. Bates! - I'm standing still, Mom! I can be a butler! - Good evening, Miss Jamieson. [Scooter backfiring] - Tess, where have you been?! - I got hung up at Sophie's. Bob came and got me. - In that?! Both of you, inside now! Bob, I have known for quite some time that you're not the world's greatest butler, but you at least seemed to care for my kids. What kind of a man leaves an eight-year-old with a total stranger? A stranger... What am I saying? A psycho! Who thinks that standing on the roof of a house is good training? - I'm sorry, Anne. - Miss Jamieson! - I'm truly sorry, Miss Jamieson. - I have to let you go, Bob. I'll pay you to the end of the month, but... I want you to leave in the morning. - Let's not get ourselves down, Rascal. You keep going... and I'll keep going. [Squeaking] - To the end of ATBJ Capital Management! [All]: Finally! Okay... - I don't feel like celebrating. [Knocking] - Come in. Why aren't you in school? - Lunch. What are you doing? - Lunch. Welcome to my home. - Nice. - Well, my natural state is messy. - I'm sorry you got fired. I just wanted the cool kids to like me. - You know, when I was a kid, I used to like building model cars. But... there was always once piece I could neverfigure out where it was supposed to go. I always felt like that piece. I've spent my whole life trying to figure out where I fit. So when you figure it out... well... that's good. - So you're saying it's good to shoplift if it helps you fit in? - I worked for a New York designer once. - You? - I was just sewing, but it was better than a lot of jobs I've done. Here. Severance pay from the sweatshop. - Bob... can you teach me how to sew? - Sorry for skipping out on you. - Yeah, we were, like, so cowardly. - This is ace. D'you steal it? - I made it. - Shut up! I want one. - Me too! - Than wouldn't we be wearing the same top? - Yeah. Like a club. - Hey, Soph. [Knocking] - I had the best day. - Great. - He followed me. - I want to be good at something. - Well, of course you do. You ever seen one of these before? Check, check, check, check. - Check, check. Check, check. - Does it look all right? - Wicked. - I hope you're ready. - Oh, God. - It's show time. Thank you for coming, ladies and... just lady. I am pleased to present original creations by Tess! [Music] Be a cool girl Like you were meant to be In a stunning outfit of skirt and top retro-"chick." That's our Sophie! - Chic, not chick. - Whatever. And next up, the twin evil girls. [Anne]: Oh! [Anne applauding] Whoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo! - And finally, the heroine of the hour, the one and only... Miss Tess! [False notes] [Knocking] - Miss Jamieson. - Yeah, I was just in the neighbourhood. I wasn't, obviously. I came to see you. - Come on in. - Ahem... - Here we are. She's very talented. - You've been so good with them. But I know the truth. - I just helped her make a few dresses. - You got my little girl out of jail. I got a phone call this morning from a Detective Alvarez. He said that he wished that half the fathers that he met were as loyal and determined as you. - Don't be too hard on her. - I think you know me better than that. - I do. - So what's next for you? - Well, I got a job. One of those butler cruises. Around the world in 365 days. - That's good for you. When do you leave? - First thing Saturday. - Oh, um... these... are... for tomorrow. - Oh, wow. I love the trumpet. - Yeah. Jacques and I were supposed to go, but, uh, I thought maybe you had someone special. - No. - Well, I guess we, uh... we each could take one. - Sure. - Okay, then. - Okay. - Okay, well, I'll see you there, then. Eight o'clock tomorrow. - Okay. It's not a date. - It's a date. - Is not. - Is. - Oh... it's not a date. A date, huh! Just two people. Two individual people who... happen to be going to the same place at the same time. All I did was give Bob my extra ticket. - It's so a date. - Who's going on a date? - Mom. With Bob. - Awesome! [Cellphone ringing] - Hello. [Jacques]: What are you doing at this moment? [Flushing] Oh... - I'm taking care of my family. I'm a single woman of a certain age, remember? - Ah, tonight, we have those, uh... tickets to the concert. - Bye, Jacques. - You will not use them. You would not go alone. Are you going alone? - Are you jealous, my little Jacques... ass? - Who is he? Who is he?! [With French accent]: Robert. - Robert... Bobert... Bob? - It's just a night out with a beautiful woman... who's stolen my heart. [Squeaking whine] [Knocking] [Frenzied knocking] I've got a doorbell, you know. - We're here to help. Let's see what you've got. - Could you have knocked a little more, maybe? - Ugly... ew... no... tragic... ew... gross... no. What's wrong with this? - Kind of bored of suits, you know? - It's perfect. What time is the concert? - Doesn't take me long to get ready. - Maybe it should. - Oh, hello, sir. Can I help you? - This is the Cosmopolitan Butler School? - It is no more. - It is closing? - I'm afraid so. Not enough filthy lucre to keep it alive. - So... you trained the great Bob. - What about Bob? - Five-day course. Mon Dieu! You are not a professional! Just a sad British man with his sad little tradition. So... now we have Bob the liar, too. - If I may say so... sir... Bob Tree is a finer man than most. And it has been an honour to know him. - Bob! - Wow. - Mom, is that you? - I'll take that as a compliment, I think. Now don't stay up too late. You sure it's not too much? - You're a hottie. - That's a good thing, right? It's not too risqu? - If you've got it, flaunt it. That's what I always say. - You better not say that. Good night. - You're early. - Yes, I am. - Hi. - You look... radiant. - Huh... you said it yourself. I have a very talented daughter. - Yeah, I couldn't believe it. - Whoa. Ticket, please, sir. - Oh, I have my... my... my ticket, it's in there. Bob has it. - Bob who? - Uh-uh-uh, Bob has my ticket. Bob. Bob. Oh... Ah... - Forget it. - Oh, come on. - It's like a dream, isn't it? [Applause] - You wanna go backstage? - I don't think we're allowed. - All right, follow me. - Bob! Yeah!!! - Euh... - Hi, Bob. - How ya doin'? - Bob? Bob! - Mama Clara! She fired me. - You sure we can do this? Ooh. - Bob, is that you? - Vince. Come on, Anne. - Ah... - How ya doin'? - Good. How are you? - Ahem. - Good to see you. - I want you to meet a friend of mine, Anne Jamieson. - Charmed. - The pleasure's mine. - You know, a few of us are going out for something to eat. Would you and your date like to, uh, go with us? - Well, she's not a date. - Uh, we'd love to. - Fantastic. - We'd love to... - I... I saw them go back there. - Who? - Oh, Bob. Bob. Are you... are you deaf? - Huh! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! - Whoo!!! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [Screaming] [Excited screaming] Oh!

I did teach her to sew. - Laugh! But not for long. If I weren't a gentleman, I would kill you right now. - Oh, Jacques! This isn't any of your business! - It is my business. Put some clothes on! - Don't you tell me what to do. I'll... run around stark naked if I want to. - Anne, you have been fooled. He is not a proper butler. - Maybe I should just go. - Oh, you think you can just sneak away? Afterwhat you did? You cannot take advantage of a middle-aged woman! - Oh! I am not middle-aged! Am I? - You're beautiful. - And I'm going to hire Bob. - To do what?! He trained for five days! Five! Cinq! - You were gonna hire me? - I... I... I... Well, you really care for my children and they adore you. - Ah, Anne! This situation is intolerable! - No, this situation is fine. You are intolerable. - C'est fini? Au revoir!!! - Au revoir! Good riddance! - Talk to my hand! - So would you... come back to work? The... children miss you and... well, we all miss you. - I can't. - I don't understand. - It wouldn't be appropriate. - Aren't you going after him? - He's leaving first thing in the morning. - Get up, Mom. [Groaning] - Tess, what are you doing? - Why did you work this hard, Mom? You're all alone. - Mom, he's part of our family. - Stay here. - Go, Mom! [Bates]: Go, Mom! - Go, Mom! Go, Mom!
