We have to stop anyway... I think we're almost there, right? Yeah. And I'll fill up the water bottle. The windscreen's covered with dead flies. THE HAPPIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD Take it. Be careful not to crease it. Are we there yet? Here sweetie, take a sip and you'll feel better. - Leave me alone. You know I hate it! - Take it! Is it really sweet at least? Use saccharine. What do I stir it with? Lt'll do you good. I've been through this, I know better. Give it back to me. You have to get better, sweetie. You're so pale. Look, it's empty! How often do I have to tell you not to slam the damn door? Sorry! Careful where you stand. Who knows who's been here! No, I'm standing on these. - Feeling better? - A little. It's the excitement and your feet, because you don't wear socks. It'll harm your ovaries. It's that crappy car. The smell makes me sick. It has nothing to do with the smell. It stinks of gasoline and whatever you use... stain remover. You felt exactly the same last month too. This is a cross we bear. We're women and that's it. But everything falls into place after giving birth. You'll see when you grow up. Take it. But it's the last one. Take those. I will. Look how creased it is! Like I'd never ironed it! Let's see. Do this. You look great, baby. How elegant we look! Ready? Yes. Let's go. I should clean up the plate... They'll fine you for nothing. You should get dressed. What are you doing? Let go of the spray can. - Are we late? - Yeah. Let's go, Delia. - Can we make another little stop? - Patience! - What's the time? Half past...? - Twenty to... We don't have much time left. Are you sick again? A little. We can't stop, Delia. We're late. We'll stop on our way back. - Are you excited? Because I am. - What do you think? I was just asking, I didn't hit you with the ax. No, I'm not. Was it so hard to answer? Well, I've answered. Don't pull away so fast... And... we're here. - You can't park here. - Where can we go? Go around to the other side of the building. Just a sec, let me out. There's so many of them! Of who? People? - This is serious business! - We'll see about that... You never know with them Bucharest people... This is a slaughterhouse! They say there's and over 1 million in transit, every day. Careful not to scratch that one! Well, I'll go meet Costel. - Didn't you say he'd come here? - I don't know. He said in front of the statues, over there. We'll see what he has to say. You're just leaving us here?! What should I do? Keep you company?! At least take us there to see what's going on, what's to be done. Okay... Let's go. Shall I go faster? - Close the door. - Okay. Let's go! Silence! Roll camera! Rolling... And action! Who do you think is the owner of this gorgeous car? Mr. Constantin Manea from Calarasi which means... it's mine. Go away, please... We're filming here. - We have business here, too. - And... cut! - You? Extras? - We're with her. Any problem? - I can handle it. - I'm her mother. We spoke with Mr. Arvunescu on the phone, he's expecting us. Right. What's the name? - Delia Fratila. - Fratila... - Let's do another one! Fast! - Just a bit... Wait a sec, please. Hey! Yo! Sir... Livelier, Mr. Manea! Joyfully! Attention! Roll camera... - Nice to meet you, madam, miss... - Action! I'm lulian Arvunescu, we talked on the phone. Welcome. This is my daughter, Delia and my husband... Let's see... Gabi! Gaaabiii! Viorel, come here. Get Gabi here right away. She's in the trailer. I'll call her. No, leave her there and take this pretty young lady to her. - Shall I go too? - No need to. It's crowded in there. Go sit over there, in the shade. - Okay... - I'm leaving. Break a leg! You're a big girl now. Bye. Come, let's go. Who do you think is the owner of this gorgeous car? Mr. Constantin Manea ...from Calarasi which means... it's mine. More, more, yeah... - Do you want some water or a coffee? - No, thanks. Okay... Gabi! I've brought somebody else. This is Delia. Delia, this is Gabi. Good afternoon. Great timing! - I was about to go on set. - Leave it, he's a guy... Start with her and, if needs be, you can stop. Great! Teach me how to do make-up. The guy sweats like a sponge and there's no-one to powder him. I'll radio you. Keep it on... OK, baby doll, sit there. Be still. - What's this on your face? - Well... Foundation. Did you put something underneath, like a cream or something...? - No. - That's not good, dear. This foundation attracts the dirt and it gets into the pores. You don't care now, but in ten years, you'll be full of black dots. I'll shampoo you to get rid of the hair spray. Did no one tell you not to come with make-up on? Without hair spray? - No... - Of course. Who cares? I think I should ask my mother. So as not to upset her. Never mind that. You'll see how pretty you'll look. Like J. Lo. - Do you have water in your eyes? - No. Listen, out of curiosity... How many labels did you send? - Oh... three. - No way! I don't believe it! Yes. You're lucky. The guy they're filming right now sent one thousand. - But I heard it was a fix. - I don't know... A fix. Some arrangement... I don't know. Easy, easy... Sit on the chair. Don't leave the door open... the cold air gets out. There's a heatwave. Sit over there, if you want. She washed her hair this morning and I arranged it a bit. You'll like it. She'll look gorgeous. Look, honey, Mr. Arvunescu gave me this. Your lines. There's not much. It's not what they sent me. He told me just now to give it to you. Leave her, she'll have lots of time later. Then I'll go see if anything needs doing. I don't want to be in your way. Be still, doll, you'll have plenty of time later. Who do you think is the owner of this gorgeous car? Mr. Manea Constantin from Calarasi, which means... it's mine. And... stop! Thanks, great! A bit livelier. "Which means... it's mine"... You've just won a car. - Okay... - And drink faster. When you say "it's mine" you already have your hand on the bottle. Let's go! We can do it. Let's introduce you to the agency. - Okay. - Roll camera... Miss Delia Fratila. We need your approval for the make-up and the clothes. Adrian Mihai, brand manager for apple, orange juice and stewed fruits. - Congratulations. - The ladies are from the agency. This gentleman is the client. He came up with the competition. Not me, our company. I didn't do it all by myself... But this is the most rewarding part of the job. - Which part? - Helping people in need. Really. Hadn't noticed you were such a philanthropist. Careful you don't see my misanthropic side. I think it's okay. Both hair and clothes, I mean. Can you turn to your left, to see your profile? The other way. And now, turn to us. And now smile. Not like this, wider, heartfelt. She's fine and we agreed we don't need a model. That's why we use normal people and spend money on testimonials. Yeah, she's okay. Thanks, sweetie. The only thing I don't like is the crappy sandals. - They won't be seen. - That's okay then. - You can go. - Thank you very much. We'll use her as she is now. We're not ready yet... If you want some tea or some mineral water... - It's there. - Thank you. You want something? - No. - We don't need anything. Then you can go sit in the makeup trailer. - At the back? - It's cooler, it's air conditioned. - Thank you. Want to go there? - Yeah. They're so pretty... God knows what these cost. One of these pink or blue boxes alone must cost 2-3 hundred thousand. Tired? Try and sleep a little. Lack of sleep damages the brain. Yeah... What are you looking at? It's pretty... - What? - The car. It's beautiful, it's big. - Great! I'm glad you like it. - Aren't you overdoing it a bit? - Overdoing what? - The sulking? I'm fine. - But why did Dad go with that Costel? - Costel found somebody, so he says. - I don't believe it, though. - Found who? A buyer, I don't know who. We were supposed to talk about that again... We'll talk, if we have to, of course. It won't be easy getting someone to pay the price Daddy wants, don't you worry... I'm not worried but, damn it, it's not fair. - Don't speak to me like that. - Oh! You're sensitive! I was thinking if I sold it next year or in 2 years, it'd be the same. No, it wouldn't, it loses value. Like half. Who told you that? Dad said that if you drive it even a day, it loses value. A used car isn't worth as much as a new one. How much less? One mil, two mil...? How much? So, after two days it's free. What do you mean? I mean 50% in the first day, another 50% the next day. - There's nothing left. 100%. - Fine, make fun of me. - Listen, is it my car or not? - Who says it's not yours? - You two. - Did I say anything like that? Maybe your father, but I doubt it. Who decided to sell the car? Who wants gas, a guesthouse, to build another floor...? Me? You never want anything. If you're so upset, I'll talk to Aurel... Give me a break! You're always going on about one thing or another, this is good this is bad, I should study Economics, now the car... Don't talk to me like a spoiled brat! As if we hadn't slaved our lives away for you... Not everybody takes care of their children like us. Sacrifices, effort... Doesn't everyone provide for their children? Stop nagging me! No one's nagging you. But in life, one has to do the right thing, not what you just feel like. Spare me the proverbs. Oh, you know it all. Your brain will explode from too much intelligence. You're cheeky and need a slap in the face! You don't get to do only what you please, life is hard. You have to do things you don't like. - I don't have to. - Have to what? Sell it. If I like it, why should you sell it? You don't want to sell it, then we won't. We agreed on something. We all said, Dad too... that we'd sell it. No one said anything, stop lying. We said we'd talk again, we'd see... We said we'll talk, but we also said we'll try to find a buyer for the car and that if we did... Isn't it for your own good? Everything we do? Give me a break with the "for me" thing. And, anyway, I'm not staying there. I'm coming here, to college. - Get in, then we'll see. - I'll get in, don't you worry. And after graduation? Don't you need a place to stay? Grandma Victoria's house, if it doesn't work as a guesthouse... you can live in it. Didn't you hear me? I'm never going back to you. - Get it? - You never know. It doesn't ask for food but it produces money. Who? - The guesthouse. - And the car does? Sweetie, a litre of gasoline costs 41 thousand. What will you do? You don't have a place to keep it. - I do. - You have a garage? Where? You don't need a garage to have a car. You can keep it in a parking lot. Right. For thieves to steal and sell it to Germans in Germany. You can hardly take care of yourself and you want a car? I don't understand... It's a shame not to use such a stroke of luck to improve our lives. Life's short. Dad explained it to you: In two years, if everything works out, you can get any car you want and when you graduate you'll come and take care of everything. Didn't you hear? I'm not coming back. How many times do I have to say it? That's fine. But we'll miss you terribly. But we'll send you some of our earnings. See? You only think about you two, about how you'll make money. - I said we'd send you money. - You said how you'd make money. - Forget it, I know you. - You do? And who took care of you? I slaved and I stayed with your father and you know how hard it was for me... You picked him... So missy can tell me now that she wants to live in the capital, that she doesn't want to live in Geoagiu Bai anymore, that Timisoara university is beneath her. Even those labels were sent with our money, if we're honest about who deserves what. What do you mean? Who gave you the money for the juice? We did... I can't believe you're nagging me about some crappy juice labels... I'm about to slap you... It wasn't easy raising you... All the sacrifices we made even for those juices. And when your father got involved with that stupid Nicoleta, I didn't file for divorce so you wouldn't suffer. Give me a break. You should've given me to the Social Services then! You gave me money for those labels! Super wonderfully splendid of you. Exactly. Isn't it normal... Look at me! Isn't it normal for a child to help her mother when the parents are in need? Are they in need because of me? Did I do anything to you? It's not my fault. Or is it? Tell me... I never said I agreed, I said I'd think about it. Well, I have and I don't want to. Look, I won't meddle any more. Talk to your father and work it out with him. If you're not meddling, then don't. Don't talk if you're not meddling... That's it. I won't say a word. Deal with your father. Fine. Why are you talking if it's none of your business? I'll talk to Dad. I just wanted to tell you what I think is right because you need to know life isn't all fun and games. - Hello. - Who let you into my trailer? Mr. Arvunescu told us to wait here because it's cool. Sorry. I'm sorry, but I have some work to do for about ten minutes. Sorry, but there's nothing I can do. God forbid! I'm leaving. If you like, you can come back later. Sit down and I'll redo your makeup, since you're here. So... she stays... It's not nice to treat us this way. We'll both be dead someday and you'll regret all these fights. - Right, you'll go straight to hell. - What are you so angry about? You said you wouldn't meddle. So don't. Sit around and knit or something. It's a variation of what we did with the other guy. You come through the orchard, push the branch aside like Mowgli and you go, go... stop here at the car, you open the door and you sit at the wheel. That's the first shot. What I want from you is... Bombardel, give her a bottle. What I want from you is to hold the juice bottle so we can see the name. - And try to look happy. Understood? - Yeah. - Are these your clothes? - Yeah. - Did no one tell you not to wear blue? - No. - Lulica! - At your service! Why didn't you tell her not to come dressed in blue? Well, I didn't know whether the screen would be blue or green. I got it this morning from Fritz. Then you should have told her not to come dressed in blue or green. - Simple as that! - Look at her! How can the guys key her? Or you do postproduction too? - No... - Don't fucking annoy me. I came to shoot this shit because the agency asked me to. So don't annoy me with your crappy production. Fuckin' Burundi. Lesotho! It's hot anyway. Take it off. I'm sorry, I'd have worn something else if I'd known... Don't worry. - It's not you, it's these morons. - You can't put blue on blue. Yeah, it's ugly... You know, they'll lay a big orange orchard over this screen and they'll take the blue out in postproduction. It'll be a big orchard and it'll look like you're walking out of it. Honey, give it to me, I'll keep it for you. - No need to. - Give it to me, don't embarrass us. Careful nothing drops out of the pockets. Don't worry. I'm perfuming the place. Let's rehearse. Shoot it right away, we're fuckin' late already. Great. We'll shoot it right away. - Are we ready? - M.O.S. What are you doing? Fuck off with that board, this one's without sound. Roll camera! - Rolling! - Action! Cut! Fantastisch. Ja ja. Can you walk a tad faster. Bombardel, give her the bottle. Roll camera! Rolling... Action. Cut! I like it. - That's not okay. - Why? She shouldn't walk like a zombie, she should look happy and while she walks she should look at the juice bottle. Man, you know... She'll smile, you know. It's weird looking at a juice bottle. And why? It's a kind of complicity with the bottle. Yeah, but it's a bit unnatural, you know? - We have the orchard... - Do as I tell you. It's good. If you want it detergent ad style, so be it. We set up some focus groups and the shittiest thing around is the one that numbskulls want. Please, when you come towards the car, look at the bottle, thrilled and smile with a big, happy smile. Get it? So, if we're all directors, I can go home. - I'm just trying to help you... - No need. Delia! Smile and goggle at that bottle, okay? - Rolling! - Action! Cut! - Perfect. - You liked that? Didn't you? I think it's over the top. Forget it, this is advertising, not arthouse cinema. Done, on to the next shot. You can take a break. - That's it? - If only! There's more. Take a break so the boys can work. Have you acted before? - No. - You're doing great. - Thank you. - Really. Does your boyfriend know you're here? Leave her alone and move that crane. - Well done, Delia. What did he say? - Who? - The boy in charge of the camera. - Mind your own business. Okay... That I did okay, that's what he said. Indeed. You were very good. I told you, you should smile more often. You were good at it. You could be an actress. Leave me alone. Stop all the... I'm thirsty. Will I get something from over there? I'll get it myself or you'll say it's your money. Stop following me around! When was the last time you had it serviced? Get lost, you pig... You need to stick a log in your stove, keep you sane! How much is a coffee and a bottle of coca-cola? They're not for sale, they're for the crew. Mr. Arvunescu told us to come and get it here. - You're with the crew... - Yes. Help yourself, then. There's always some beggar and you're not supposed to give 'em anything. Indeed... And a coffee. - It's warm. - It's better than nothing. What do you want, champagne on ice? I wasn't talking to you. - I'm going to the bathroom. - Go... Everything's fine, right? Yes. - Great. Where from? - Geoagiu-Bai, Hunedoara. You'll be hanging around a while, or going straight back? - Straight back. - Too bad. - And where do you work? - I don't work, I'm in high school. Wow. You look very mature! Ready to start living your life? - Yeah... - And what about college? - I'll study tourism, maybe. - Nice. You'll see all the countries in the world. Well, maybe we'll meet again. Who knows? - Let's go, they're ready. - I'm coming. And please, don't run off without telling me first. Because no one knew where you where. I get the blame. Sorry... - Where were you? - What do you care? - Come on. - Leave her alone, madam, it's easy. Let's hurry. Listen up. This has to be just right. - You've learned your lines? - Yeah. Great. Sit at the wheel with your right hand on the wheel, cool, and with your left you arrange your eyebrow in the rearview mirror. The way girls do. You say your lines and, before "send them in now", you drink half the juice in the bottle. And make it look like you're really thirsty, okay? - Is it hard? - I don't think so. Piece of cake. You have some experience already, right? So, we'll rehearse once to see how easy it is. Okay? - As you wish. - Let's try. - Okay. - Go sit behind the wheel. Push her seat forward a bit. Make a bit of room, honey bee. Per-fect. Okay. Give her the bottle. Let's see how it works. Nice! Lines! Drink! Drink!!!! More!!! Put the cap back on. Now start the car and leave. - Why don't you leave? - I... - She doesn't know how to drive. - No license? Good she didn't win a helicopter, she'd have had to parachute. No prob. Don't be scared. The guys will push you. Okay? Let's push, guys. We're late! Ready! Silence! Roll camera! - Rolling! - Action! I'm Delia Cristina Fratila and I'm the happiest girl in the world. I've sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels... Cut. Livelier and say the whole thing: 'Luckiest, happiest'. Tell her to say it correctly. It's "my name is", not "I'm". Say it right, "my name is", not "I'm". - Okay? - Okay. Sorry... Don't forget to smile as wide as possible, with your whole heart and try to look really happy. Happiness must be felt at all times, but especially when you drink. Okay? Smile! Wider! Like that! Great! How can I put it to you...? What you're doing here is very important to our company. We show that we help ordinary people to fulfill their dreams. Get it? Remember that millions are going to watch you. And you must make them believe that anything is possible, that anyone can be a winner. Yeah. Good luck. I'm done. My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the luckiest, happiest girl in the world. I sent in and I won this gorgeous Logan Break. Send them in now! Cut! - How was it? - Wonderful! Delia... Emphasize "gorgeous". This juice looks suspiciously yellow to me. - Let's make it a bit more orange. - It's your juice... That's the color. Yeah, but let's make it more tempting, like you'd really want to drink it. Add some coffee. It'll make it redder. Coffee or coke. Bombardel, pour some coke in that bottle and make it orange-red. Yes, boss. Let's hurry, I have a girl to deflower at 6 PM. Move it! - Do I have to drink it? - It's just coke. Ready! Silence! Roll camera... Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila and I'm the luckiest, happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and won this gorgeous Logan Break. Drink it! Drink it! Send them in now! Cut! It's better... That's better, but you have to drink more juice. - Gabi! Come here... - Yeah... - This girl has a moustache! - Didn't you see it? It's just a bit of fluff. Everybody has it! - Stop arguing and remove it. - Okay, but it'll take a while. Right away. Please, don't leave a single hair! I don't have money for postproduction depilation. You won't see a thing, I promise. Fuck! Now it's red! Sorry... Put this ice on it and press it hard. - A doughnut? - No, thanks... He said he can't give us all 12 thousand at once. He'll give us 8 now and the rest later. - What's wrong? - Nothing, Aurel. Nothing. Nothing or everything? You don't like anything or you dislike everything? - I don't understand. - I'm the one who doesn't understand. You're not happy with what I've done. I never said that. If you don't like it, and you think you're so smart, then find something better. Since you're always right. - What are they doing to her? - They removed her moustache. - They shaved her?! - No, they waxed her. - And how's it going? - So-so. Just so you know, we fought terribly. What did she do? She's unhappy, the poor thing. It's the car. Haven't we talked to her already? Isn't everything clear? My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the happiest girl in the world... I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and won this gorgeous Logan Break. Send them in now! Cut! Why aren't you paying attention? It's good, but please, don't forget "luckiest". - It's crucial to us. - Yes. - How's it going? - Fine. - A doughnut? - No, thanks. - You look good as an actress. - Good. - Nice little car. - Yeah. You had an argument with your mother? She had one with me, not me with her. Why? I said some things and she started screaming like a crazy person. Oh. I brought the papers. Everything is in order. Costel took me to someone who agreed to our price. Exactly as we wanted it, it can't get any better than this. - I couldn't care less. - What's with you? - What's with me? - I don't know. Something happened to make you so upset. Did they upset you? - No. It's nothing. - You could be happy, like us. Well, I'm happy. Move aside, please, we're shooting. Don't shout. You scared me. And... Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the luckiest, happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and won this gorgeous Logan Break. Send them in now! And... cut! Mister "artist", tell her again to drink more heartily. And what am I supposed to do? These people can't act! The smart ones don't always win! I know, but let's try again. It's no big deal. Delia, drink more. Like you're really thirsty. I can't do it anymore. I'm swollen with all this juice. Force yourself! - What's with the airs? - C'mon, Delia, really... She should be Setila (the thirsty one) And not Fratila (the brotherly one). Fuck you, man, don't be a dickhead. My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the luckiest, happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and won this gorgeous Logan Break. Send them in now! Cut! Livelier. I'm begging you. You looked dead. Look happier, you've won the car. - It really is your car. - Yes. Sorry. Delia, what's going on? You're doing it on purpose or you're sick? - I'm okay. - Do what he says and get it over with. - I'm doing it. - Still feeling sick? No. This juice is giving me a stomach ache. Give her something for nausea. Do you have anything? How many pills should I give her? She'll get drowsy and droopy. Didn't you hear? She's sick? I did, but we'll destroy her with all these pills. She'll get an ulcer. So we'd better leave her be sick and throw up inside the car. We're ready to shoot. Silence. Please, clear the frame. You're obstructing us. - We were talking to our daughter. - And you're creating chaos. Sorry... Silence! Roll camera! Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and I won this gorgeous Logan Break. Drink! Drink! Drink! More! More! Send them in now! Cut! Great! Move the car back... I've just realized... We have a problem. We've said we'd shoot towards a modern building, towards the traffic. No. In the end we decided to use something more stylish, an old building, more refined... Petite Paris... We said we'd film one winner a la Petite Paris and the other one more goal-oriented, emphasized by a new building and the traffic. That's how I remember it, too... What new building? We are at the University... Maybe on Victoriei, at the Bancorex building... No can do. Who'll authorize it, on the spot? No way! Maybe... something like the Intercontinental. It's a symbol... Okay. I've nothing against it, but we have to move the lights, the camera... It takes time. The car... Couldn't you have noticed sooner? Nothing I can do. I'll have problems at work, with Jean-Pierre. He was quite clear, we have to shoot it as we said. Okay, everybody stop. We're moving. Why? They want a modern fucking building. - We'll move closer to the Inter... - Are you crazy? The fucking light goes, it's all over. Don't blame me, there's nothing I can do. - You don't like it, go talk to them. - Whatever. Let's move! Faster, we're losing the light. - And where do we go? - There! To see the Inter as a modern building. Goal-oriented. Take a break. Do you know how much longer it'll take? No, we're moving to the other side. - Where are you going? - To the toilet. Wait! Sign here so I can take it back. What's this? That contract with Mr. Manciulea, the guy Costel took me to meet. Didn't I tell you we agreed about the money? I'm going to the toilet. See? I told you so. I'll talk to her. Her tummy problem is no excuse. Delia! Come here! - What? - Sit down. Sign the contract so I can get a move on and we can go home on time. Daddy, I was talking to Mama, and I think we should keep it. I like the car and I want to keep it. Delia, don't start again or we'll get into a fight. - A really bad one. - What is it? Nothing. I'm talking to her now. I told her. I like the car too, but that's life. I explained it clearly. In life, you don't always do what you want. I've told her that we make efforts for her, that we've toiled our whole lives for her to have enough to eat. - Do you know what she said? - What? - That she doesn't care. - It's that so? That she doesn't give a shit about our problems, because they're nothing to do with her. That's what she said. - Did you say that? - That's not true. I said I won the car and I can do as I please with it and that if she has problems, it's not because of me. And what did I say? I didn't say I don't give a shit. I said I'm not to blame. And what does it mean? It's not a matter of blame. You know we're having a hard time. Problems at work, my diabetes... Mama works on a teacher's wage. - That's exactly what I told her. - Right. And now we have the chance -the certainty- of solving all our problems and living better when we're old. I know, but I... Listen to me without getting upset. - Will you? - Yes. If we sell the car, as we've decided, we can, one, make that boarding house and make some real money and, two, help you through college. True? - No. - What do you mean, no? Thing is... I want to keep the car because... Wait, don't rush in like a... Tell me if it's true what I've said so far. Okay, it's true. If you keep the car, what will you do with it? You drive it. And how does that benefit you? I'm asking you. How does that benefit you? Answer me, because I'm a gentleman, not some idiot. - Okay... - Tell me... I don't know... Does the car buy you bread or meat? Does it help you through college? - Does it buy you clothes? - Or school supplies? - Those are very expensive, too. - No, but I'll manage. - I'll get a scholarship. - How can you manage, Delia? Without our help, you'll starve to death. That's my business. I'll get a scholarship. To get a scholarship, don't you have to be a student and pay for accommodation and so on? - Then I'll get a job. - Where? I'll find something, a part-time job, and I'll manage. - And if you don't? - She'll manage... If I don't manage, I'll see then what I can do. - I'd sell the car. - You see? Lt'll come to this anyway. Except, if you sell it, I don't know, half a year from now, it'll be less valuable. That's what I told her, it could be half the price. You tell her. She wouldn't listen to me. Woman, please. Can't you see I'm talking to her? - I'm minding my own business... - No, you're not. You just poke your nose into other people's business! I only said that I'd told her that. Don't tell me what you've told her. It's my turn to talk to her. Just forget it. Why are you yelling at me in front of strangers? - Everybody's watching us. - Nobody's watching. - The hell they are! Lord forgive me! - You're yelling at me and I only... Cut the shit and shut the fuck up! You're fucking killing me! - You're killing us both. - Go on, swear. That's all you know. - Shut up! - You drink like a pig and swear like a Gypsy! Delia, this is how it is. We're going to sell the car and set up the boarding house like we agreed. I've even thought of a name. "Delia". The "Delia" boarding house. Isn't it pretty? - Tell me, do you like it? - I don't know. Why my name? - It's a very pretty name. - I don't know. What does grandma say? What if she doesn't give you the house to do what you want with? What? Doesn't she want to live better, too? I don't think she'll agree to all this stuff with her house. She's old and set in her ways. - She won't agree to it. - She will. It's good for her too, because we'll be there more often. So she won't die alone, the poor thing. If she doesn't, good riddance. We've done things her way so long, now it's our turn. - That's right. - What should we do? Sit at home, starving on our little salaries? When we were struck by luck and could all live much better? Her too... After one year, we'll recoup the investment and a year after that we'll have at least 10-12 thousand euros. At least. Do you know how much Chira in Rapolt makes? - No. - Guess. - I don't know. - 15 thousand. And her courtyard is smaller than ours. But her house is huge. It is, but that area isn't as beautiful as ours. - Tell me. - Tell you what? - Am I right or not? - Now you're changing the subject. I won the car and I want to keep it and drive it. I was talking to Cornelia about going to the seaside. In my car. How, if you don't even have a license? I'll have it by then. You talk nonsense. Who'll pay for your driving lessons and the exam? It's not free, nothing ever is. - It costs a bomb. - Shut up. Tell me, how will you pay for your driving lessons? - I don't know, I'll borrow. - You'll borrow... And then you'll repay it... Don't be as stubborn as a mule. As a what, then? Just don't be stubborn, that's all I'm saying. How much less will it be worth by next year? The car? I don't know, Minimum, I mean. You'd barely sell it for 6 thousand. Then I'll keep it for a year and then we'll sell it. Wasted money, and for nothing... And you don't even know you'll be able to sell it. People want new cars, there's so much progress. Nobody wants an old piece of junk, Delia. - It's not junk after just one year! - Really? If you sell it tomorrow, it's already second-hand. That's it, we'll sell it second-hand. So at least I get to keep it for a year. Another thing. A Logan's not a girl's car. See how big it is? If it were a Volkswagen or a Fiat, I wouldn't have said a thing. - But I like it. - Ready to shoot. - Coming. - Hurry, we're losing the light. Sir, I have something to discuss with my daughter. She'll come, it's not like she'll run away. - Look, sign it. - No. I don't want to. Please, let's go. You can talk later. Can't you see I'm talking with my daughter? Yes, but the light's fading. - Please... - I'm going. She's cheeky. Why do you butt in? If you'd let me talk to her, the problem would be solved already. I'm her mother, I have the right to talk to her. Give me a break. When I talk to her, don't go butting in like an idiot. Let her be! Get in the car! Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and I won this gorgeous Logan Break. Cut! Girlie, in school, do they teach you Romanian? Yes... Are you familiar with the word "happy"? - Yes. - Then be happy, for Christ's sake! What's so complicated? In the words of a great living writer, "fuck off, motherfuckers!" Pay attention, please. Leave her alone to see how it is. I was just telling her to pay attention. Don't tell her anything. She doesn't need us, anyway. Instead of giving her confidence, what do you do? Let her learn the hard way. It'll teach her. She's miserable, poor little thing. They want to give her a Logan and she won't even pay attention to them. - She's right to want the car. - That's life. What can I do about it? - Silence! Roll camera... - Rolling... Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and won this gorgeous Logan Break. Drink! Drink! Drink! I'm watching you! Drink! Send them in now! Cut! How long was it? Great! Delia, it was good, but it was too long. It needs to be 35 seconds long and you took 39. - I can't go faster than that. - Really? You could before. Take our word for it, we're not complete morons. And a lot happier. A big smile, okay? Okay. My name is Delia Cristina Fratila and I'm the happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and I won this gorgeous Logan Break. Drink! Drink! Drink! What happened? I don't know, it might be the generator. Go see what the fuck happened! Delia, the smile was better. But the projectors were off. It's better in the dark... Burundi... - It's the generator. - What's wrong? - I don't know, it wouldn't start. - Does it have enough fuel? Yeah. But it's a piece of shit. So the generator is off... It was overused. - Fuck off! - They're trying to fix it. I've already ordered a new one. - It'll be here in 30 minutes. - Fuck them. It's gonna be too dark. - They'll be here in 30 minutes. - I don't care. Let's take five! Take a break! There where hardly two lightbulbs on. Are you pulling my leg? Romanians... I've just talked to them, they're trying to fix it. - In 30 minutes... - Fix it? They're only looking at it! - What's wrong? - I had a pebble in my shoe. My goodness... Did you remove it? - Yeah. - Great. Delia, do you think we want you to be unhappy? I never said that. You think we're vultures, me and Mama? - That we want to harm you? - That's not the point. I'm begging you, answer my question. Tell me. No, I don't think that. We did it all for you, not for us. If it'd been only us, we'd have got on with our lives and not gone to any trouble. We wouldn't have tried to set up a boarding house, to scrape money together. We'd have had no use for it. - You believe me? - I believe you. I like sitting around, too. No one likes to work. If working were easy, all the morons would work. When I was your age, nobody gave me anything. Except maybe a beating. Then I laboured in the factory, in the pollution. I stuck it out so you'd have everything you needed. I even got diabetes but I never gave up. I know... So that you could go to school and be prepared for life. We saved money for your clothes, toys, dolls, pencils... so that you wouldn't feel deprived. So that the rich children wouldn't laugh at you... You might not believe it now, but this is how it was. I believe you, I never said I didn't. I rarely bought myself trousers. I've smoked only Carpati and Bucegi, ate what was given to me, just crusts of bread. Did you lack anything? - Tell me. - No. You didn't. Yes, we didn't have enough money for trips to China or Japan or for caviar and champagne... But you had everything you ever needed. - Right? - Yes. Then cut the crap and sign the contract because the man is waiting. But it's not fair. It's my car, I won it and I want to drive it around, at least for one-two years. I'm begging you, please, Dad. - Are you starting that again? - No... You're driving us nuts, you moron! You said you understood but you don't. But why can't I keep the car if I want to? If God gave it to me, it's only fair that I use it... I'm telling you nicely and you won't listen. Girl, on my word of honour, in two years time you'll buy any car you like. I swear. Sign here. You'll see, in two years time you'll see eye to eye with me. You'll say: "I was about to do something foolish, thank God for the old man" That's what you'll say. Youth passes quickly and life is disappointing. And if your business doesn't work? How could it not? That's what works everywhere in Europe. Cities grow bigger and people long for the countryside. Nobody wants fancy places like Sinaia or Mamaia anymore. - Everybody wants nature. - And what if it doesn't work? Look what happens in Bucharest, look at this madness. They have no place to rest, poor people. Sign here. Look, I'm not going to keep begging you. Will you sign or not? No. I've never been allowed anything. I never went to holiday camp, because you didn't have money, I never had a party because of God knows what else. And when I came in 3rd in my class in 8th grade, Mama promised me a party but, in the end, I wasn't allowed one. I never had a normal life, like everybody else. While my classmates were having fun, I had to clean around the house and pick fruit in the summer. Now all my classmates are waiting to see the car. They didn't believe I'd won. I've talked to Cornelia about going to the seaside and... Please Dad, it's mine, I won it. Please. I think I've been straight with you and explained our situation. - Will you sign or not? - No! Very well, Delia. But me and Mama are through with you. What do you mean? You can take your car and do whatever you want. But you won't set foot in my house again and you are no longer my child. You won't get anything from us anymore. - Absolutely nothing. Take your car. - But it's not fair. You're treating us like fools. You don't want to sign, fine, bye-bye. I have to beg you. I raised you like a princess, I wiped your ass when you were little. ...You've no shame? If we were sick, you'd leave us die all alone, in shelters or in the hospital. You wouldn't even bury us... - That's not true. - Give me a break! You don't want to sell it, great! I don't want to see you again. Sit there and cry. Shitty movie star! She caught me at the corner. The floor is waxed... Boss! Come here! They know nothing about anything. Do you know how to eat pussy? With small licks, so you don't swallow too much hair... Leave me alone, Bombardel... I'm in trouble... I'm in trouble, too... I have problems with my gall bladder. I'll die soon... Don't bother putting me down in the grave in my coffin because it's no use. Better hold me by the dick and send me down slowly... And don't shake it too much, because I'll get a hard-on... - Are you nuts? - Life's worth living! We have to get enough pussy in our life! - Do you like pussy? - Yeah... Then why did you get out? - Okay, I'll sign it. - Maybe you should apologize first. - What for? - For making Daddy cry. Please, Magda. Let me do it. But you must give me 3,000 and let me go on holiday with Cornelia. - What 3,000? - Euros. It's not fair not to get something. Don't you understand? We'll give you everything back in two years. But I want to make sure I have enough for college. That's why I need at least 3,000. We can't give you 3,000... Only 2,000. We'd have given you that anyway, you didn't have to ask. - 2 isn't enough. I want 3. - Impossible, kitten. If I had it in the bank, I'd give you 10,000. But we're investing it. As soon as we start making some profit, we'll give it to you. - We're ready. - I swear. Now. It's urgent, we don't have much light left. Young man, you're not the only one with problems. - Let her go. - One more minute. At least 2,700. So I don't have to worry about college. I said 2,000. Okay, 2,300. Once we've done our thing, we'll give you more, we won't leave you on your own. - At least 2,700. - She has the brains of a businessman! Why don't you study Economics? my final offer, as the Americans say. Okay. But I want it straight up. No can do. Fifty-fifty, that's how I'm getting it from Manciulea. - That's not my problem. - What am I supposed to do? and the rest afterwards. - Which is when? - 4 months from now. - Okay. - Sign it. - Give me the pen. - Didn't you keep it? - No. - We'll find it. - And give me this Dacia. - Of course. Whenever I don't need it, it's yours. No, give it to me for good. So I have my own car while I'm here, at college. No way. If you stay home, I'll give it to you. But we'll talk about it. Let's go. There's no light left. - I'm coming. - Sir, just one second. If she doesn't come right now, we lose a day's shooting. - She'll have to pay for it. - Have a pen? - She needs to sign something for me. - We have to finish shooting! If she doesn't come, you'll have to pay for it. I swear. What is this? Hiroshima? Nagasaki? Fucking moron... Girlie, get in the car! Leave her alone. Roll camera... Miaunel, diffuse that light. Faster! Let's go up... Easy... How's the background? Almost dark. If we don't shoot now, we're fucked. My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and won this gorgeous Logan Break. Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!!! Send them in now! Cut. - Another one, and fast! - She shouldn't be so stiff. "Stiff". You like suggestive language. - Get lost... - Stop playing hard to get. As usual. A big smile. Delia, a bigger smile and use your teeth! Another one, quickly. Say your lines, and then say them again. Faster. Don't stop until I say so. It's a loop! Put the crane up! Move away! Roll camera... - Move away, Bombardel... - Fuck off! - Roll camera... - Rolling! Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the happiest girl in the world I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and won this gorgeous Logan Break. Send them in now! Go back up! Drink more and look happier! Please, Delia! Roll camera... Go away, Bombardel. Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and won this gorgeous Logan Break. Drink! Drink! Drink! More! Drink more! - She should drink more! - Send them in now! Cut! Go back up! Faster! Delia, drink more. Stop rolling your eyes, drink more in one sip. Get out of there! Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm... - Cut! Delia, please... - One more! Concentrate, what the fuck? Faster! Action! My name is Delia Cristina Fratila, and I'm the happiest girl in the world. I sent in 3 Bibo Multifruit labels and I won this gorgeous Logan Break. Drink! Drink! Drink! Look happy! Send them in now! Go back up. Cut! Pretty good. One more and then we go home. Get me down. - We're going home. It's over. - Try a bit more. Can't do it. I've already under-exposed. - So, that's it. - Wrap everything. They're not so great. I mean, she smiled okay but she didn't drink... - I mean she drank too little. - No, I thought she was okay. We can see to it in the cutting room, perhaps we can use some other takes. It wouldn't really work, the light is different. First we were in broad daylight... I can change the lighting and shoot at night. No, it's sombre. Okay then, we'll use this. - We could dub her. - Okay. Anyway, we'll see all the rushes and maybe we'll chose one of the previous takes. Some of them were quite decent. Yeah, that's do-able. I'm leaving, then. Thanks a lot. - Want to go eat something? - If you're buying... Bye. Thank you. - So, we leave it as it is? - Yeah, that's a wrap. The shooting is over, thanks! Let's pack things up. - Thanks a lot, guys. Bye. - Bye. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. It was very good! But like I told you, don't be so shy. Thank you very much for your patience. She is shy. No problem, everything went just fine. - I'm leaving... - Where to? - To the Judas Priest concert. - Those faggots? - What faggots? - The bald one, Halford, he's a faggot. - No way... - Really. - Bye. Enjoy the car. - Thank you. - Well done, Delia. It went fine. - I've found the pen. We're going home! Great! We're going straight home now. Hey! Where's the director so I can get reimbursed for the gasoline? - It's not him who does it... - Who does, then?
