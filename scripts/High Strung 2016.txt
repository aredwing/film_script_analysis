I can't remember when I started dancing. It's always just been who I am. Balanchine said, "See the music, hear the dance." It's my first day in New York City. My eyes are wide open. And I am ready to listen. This is how you start the day, Krispy. Let's go! Breakfast going to be good today, Rik. Come on, let's go, let's go! Hey! Let's go, Rik. Don't slow up on me now. Hit it! All right, yeah. Drop it, drop it. Go! Let 'em fly. There it is. Come on, we're gonna be late. Oh, we're going left, up here, to the dance department. - Can you wait just a sec? - Sure. So, honey, here we are. Everything that you've always wanted. Thank you for making this happen. You made it happen. Just make sure you call me if you need anything at all. - Even just to talk. - I will, I will. Oh, mom. - Call me. - I promise. I'll be fine. - I'll be fine. - I know you will. It's just me I'm worried about. I love you. That's all I'm going to say. I love you too. Bye. Oh! I'm sorry. I was just... admiring here. - Ruby? - I'm sorry. - She's beautiful. - Ah! Alexandra Danilova. One of our greatest. So, we have placed you in division C2. The dress code is mandatory for all classes. Except Contemporary. And we do not tolerate tardiness. Ever. So, your first class starts tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Yes, ma'am. Madame Markova. Madame Markova. Any questions? If there isn't a dress code for the Contemporary class, what do we wear? Use your imagination. All right, then. - Good luck. - Thank you. What are you doing? - I'm so sorry! - Forget it. Just watch where you're going next time. Love your playing. You're welcome. - Ruby? - Yep, you must be Jasmine. Yeah, but, everyone calls me Jazzy, except my parents. - Okay. - Come on in! You know, you don't have to ring the doorbell, you live here. Oh, right. I figure this is my bed, so, I'll just put my stuff here. Yeah, that's perfect. - You're on scholarship? - Yeah. Me too. It's my second year. Hey, how did it go with Markova? - Great. - Really? Someone must have dislodged a broomstick up her butt, because normally she is an uptight witch. Actually, I'm pretty sure the broom is still there. This is cute. You should wear this tonight. Um, where are we going? We're going out. But, we have class tomorrow morning. Yeah and this is your first night living on your own in New York City! We are so going out! - No, we're not. - Yes, we are! - No! - Yes! I got the red line drafted, that's right. - Hey. -I'm waiting for the counter. Okay. Okay, I'll call you back. - Hey, hey, Johnnie. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Yeah, not bad. - You want something to drink? - No, I'm good, mate. - You sure? - Yeah. Here you go. It's all there. Great. So, when do you think you'll have it by? Soon, don't worry. I'll file the papers as soon as I get back to the office. I'll call you by the end of the week. We should have an update on it. All right, I mean, thank you for handling all this. I guess I'll see you. - I'll be waiting for your call. - You got it, kid. We have the right to be here. I want to see some ID right now. Yo! Wait up. Hey, man. You live upstairs? Uh, yeah, Simon's place. Oh, that's cool. You gotta love Inwood, right? Neighborhood is sketchy, but the price is right. At least it's Manhattan, right? Right. Oh, Hayward Jones III. - Johnnie Blackwell. - Johnnie Blackwell. It's nice to meet you, Johnnie. Hey, um... why don't come and meet the rest of my crew? Uh, that's all right, man. Ah, come on! Krispy just made some ugly, alien octopus. You'll like it. Okay. All right. - Yo, guys! - Open your mind. - Now, who is this guy? - It's Johnnie B. Lives upstairs. Calamari? And that's a little Chipotle and Remulade. It's for the dipping. These are my roommates. Krispy and Rik. Ah, is that you playing up there like Yo Yo Mama? Yo Yo plays the cello. - You play the violin, right? - Right. Oh, we know. We hear you playing all night long. Oh, when do you sleep? Would you all leave the dude alone? We're the Switch Steps crew. You might have heard of us. Well, I haven't been in the country for that long. Well, take a seat, Harry Potter. And we'll give you a little preview. - All right, guys. - Now, relax. You got this, Rik. Rik is our freestyle super freak. And that red head you seeing right there, that's Jay. She's harder than most of the guys. And that's Ari. All right, Ari, let's go. Oh, and Pop Tart, she's a sweetheart. She's our diva. And Krispy, he can cook, groove, and clean! And that's my bro Tip-toe. And Jackson, Jackson can groove about everything. - Ah! - We blew a fuse. Yeah! - This is so cool! - Yeah! All the dancers hangout here. Hey, guys! - Hey! - This is Ruby. - My new roommate. - Hi! Nice to meet you. It's her first year in MCA. Come on, let's dance! - Do you want to go? - Yeah! Hurry! - Coming! -Come on. I can't be late for my first day. Wait, this is the earliest I have ever left the apartment. Ugh, I'm already exhausted! See, now we can relax. Much less stressful, don't you think? Ugh, I'd rather live on the edge of tardiness. Oh, hey, you have to hear this little guy. Yeah, that's great, you'll hear it every day. - Oh! - Oh! Hi. - I thought you were someone else. - But she's glad you're not. Uh, me too, I guess. Kyle, this is my new roommate, Ruby. - Hi. - Uh, first day? Yeah. - Well, good luck. - Thanks. - Um, bye. - See ya. I can tell you're dying to know and hear his story. I'm not dying. Yes, you are! His name is Kyle Endeca. Super cute, insanely talented and ridiculously arrogant. Too bad he's not my type. Seemed into you, though. Really? Hey, relax! I can't help it. You'll be fine! There's April. Yeah, we've met. She's perfect, I hate her. Morning. Good morning. Is that our teacher? Kramrovsky. Isn't he a little frail? Ask me that after class. Yes, more, more, more! Push, push, push! I want turning! Move your hands, Jazzy! Why are you doing sickle piques, April? Ruby, reach! More, more! More, more! He's tough! They broke both his hips in a concentration camp. He was just a kid. Very sloppy! That man is as tough as they come. Again. Try again. Watch your traveling, Emilio! Wow, Miss Thing, you are quite the trainer. Thanks, but I think I'm going to throw up. Don't do that. Wait till after Contemporary. - Oh, God! - What? - Got a cramp? -No, I'm terrible at Contemporary! Oh, come on. We gotta change. - Oh, sorry! - No! - I'm so sorry. - Ruby, what are you doing? You completely collapsed on your partner. You're going to injure him like that. - I'm sorry, I've never had any Contempo... - No excuses! Pull yourself together. Now, get out there! And dance! Are you okay? I already have blisters! Just swing by the pharmacy to get Pepper H and H. For my feet. It numbs the toes. I've never heard that one before. Girl, you have got a lot to learn. I'm going to get my student ID. I'll see you at the apartment. Oh, sorry. Hey, look who's here. The Village People. The one in the yellow hat. - Hit it, Jay. - Gotcha! Come, on! Let's go! Hey, yo, yo, yo, check this out, check this out. The Work crew are battling the Reapers. His head's in his butt! Oh! Hey! No! - Are you okay? - Yes. - Watch your bag. - Thank you. No. No. Your violin. Oh! - Hey, on your feet. - There's a cop, he can help you. Wait! - Why are you following me? - Because I want to help you. Thanks, but I think you've done enough. Why won't you just go to the police? Could you say that any louder? I'm sorry. I don't know what your story is. I'm screwed, that's my story. Wait, I think we should just stop for a second and make a plan. Listen, we are not a team here. Where's the closest place to hawk a violin? I have no idea. Come on! I think it's a pawn shop. No pawn shop, lady, it's a consignment store. I'm sorry. We're looking for a violin. No, it's a Luigi Mingazzi. It would have been brought in no more than 15 minutes ago. - By who? - A thief. Are you insinuating that I buy hot property in here? - No, not at all. - I think she just did. She didn't mean to. Why don't you two clowns clear out of here? Wait, can we leave our number? Just in case someone brings it in. You're wasting our time with this guy. He isn't going to help us. Sometimes, people can surprise you. - Thank you. - Yeah, I'm full of surprises. It's a really special violin, isn't it? My grandfather gave it to me. Why are you peddling down in the subway? - Busking. - Busking. Well, I can only work for cash. Are you a tax evader? No. I am British and I don't have a visa to stay here. - Well, that's a relief. - Not for me. I thought... I don't know, maybe you were some hardened criminal. No, it's just... there isn't really anything for me back in England. What about your family? Like I said... It's nothing. Can I buy you a piece of pizza? - What's your name? - Ruby. - That's pretty. - Thanks. My mom named me after the Balanchine Ballet. So, you're a dancer? Yup. I'm Johnnie. Nice to meet you. I'm home! Is that my delinquent roommate? Yes. What is that smell? Oh, I cremated my pointe shoes. I see. It works. They're as hard as a rock. Where have you been? I had a bit of an adventure. Without me? Sit. I want details. I met this guy... in a weird, weird incident. And he's moody, and edgy. And eccentric. What does he look like? I don't know how to describe him, actually. Well, is he cute? He's more like fierce sexy. Ugh! I love the sound of that. - Did you get his number? - Yeah. - Where does he live? - Uptown. I think he said, "Inwood." Ruby, that's atrocious! Jason, wait till you're behind the music! - How are you doing? -I've never heard anything like this. - It's like G.I. Joe Jazz! - Hang in there. Shaun, what's going on back there? You're late! Good, April! That slide needs to be bigger. And up! Great roll, I like this. Hit that line, ladies. That'll do. Next. How do you pick up those combinations so fast? I know! Ruby, can I see you, please? I know you're trying to get a handle on my style. But without Contemporary, you can't be competitive in the professional world and that just won't fly with this school. I understand that, and believe me, I am willing to do whatever it takes to catch up. - I promise. -Well, I want to see it next class. A bit tough on Ruby, don't you think? It's because she's so talented. Ah, interesting technique. Well, don't you have thirty two fortes to unleash on your next class? Hey, Neal, it's Johnnie Blackwell here. I've left you a ton of messages and I haven't heard anything back from you. Got my cash, and I really need that Green Card. Call me, please. Hey, whoa, what are you doing? - Going to see my lawyer. -You've got to sign in here first. Who do you want to see? Neil Tamlen. From Tamlen and Ginsburg Law Firm. No, you got the wrong building, buddy. I don't think so. That's our address, but, there's never been a Ginsburg and Tamlen on this building. At least not for the last 15 years I've worked here. That's impossible. It's an immigration law firm, I've been Neil's client for the last 3 months. You've been up to this guy's office in this building? No, I always met him outside the office. Sorry, kid. Card's a fake. Fat free, sugar, carbs. Fat free. Fat free. Oh, but there's chocolate with peanut butter! Are you going to buy something or you just talk to the machine? Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. Thank you. Fat free! Always. - Hey, pretty girl. - Hey, Kyle. There you go. One loaner violin bow. You break it, you buy it. It's the best you've got? Hey, Ruby, right? - Yeah. - How's first week going? Good! Well, challenging, actually. Yeah, mine too. I, uh... broke my bow playing Bartok. Ooh, sounds painful. Yeah, it is, I've to use this lame loaner till I can get to the music store. - They loan instruments here? - Yeah. Hey, I'm off to practice, but I'll, uh... - see you around? - Okay, yeah, bye. Hi. Yes? Can I borrow that violin, please? This is a viola. I meant the other violin. - To the... - To the right. Okay. - Are you a student here? - Yes, sir, I am. Can I see some ID, please? I have it right here. Okay. One violin. Need a bow, too? Oh, yes, please. So, are you entering the competition? What competition? That competition. There you go. Hey, Simon. - How's London? -What do you think? It's cold and it's wet. Where's my rent money? I'm sorry it's late. You know, I had an unexpected setback, but um... I'm working on it. Oh, you better work quickly or you're out on the street. Listen, Johnnie, I'm not messing around here. - You hearing me? - I hear you. Hey, what's going on, baby? Hey. Hi. Oh, I love your place. Yeah, thanks. - It's not mine. - You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What's that? It's a loaner violin from my school. Crazy idea. You can enter into this contest for the Peterson Foundation. Winner gets $25,000. So, you could buy a new violin. And you get a full scholarship to the Manhattan Conservatory of the Arts! Which will qualify you for a student visa. I don't need a handout from any conservatory. What's wrong with conservatories? Oh, nothing if you're a spoiled rich kid willing to conform to the rules and politics of an elitist school promoting success over arts. I see. And you're above all that, down in the subway where you're really nurturing your art. I play what I want, when I want. I don't get you. You've been given a gift. But you play with so much anger. I'm surprised anyone is brave enough to listen to you. - I'm not playing for them. -Who are you playing for? Yourself? You know, music is like dance. It's a link to the soul. It can make people laugh and it can make people cry. It... It can inspire! With a power like that... why wouldn't you want to share it with the world? I guess I'm not like you, then. Ruby! Hi, Jazzy. Hey, Ruby. A bunch of us are at the pub. Come meet us! Hey! What's up, man? You doin' all right, man? Yeah. Really? You sure don't look too good to me, man. Yeah, we haven't heard you playing your violin. It got stolen. Now that's going to put a dent in your pocket. Don't worry, bro man. We got your back. You can work with us. Thanks, guys, but... I can't dance like you. Ah, who said anything about dancing? All right, so, I'm up on stage, we're doing that... We're doing all this... Hey, watch it, man. - What the hell? - I'm so sorry! Come on. It was not his fault! He should look where he's going. You are such a snob. Ruby! Hey. How was your mystery man? Disappointing. Oh! Come on. Come on. We're eating fried food. Should make you feel better. - Hey. - Hi. Take a seat. Whoo! Yeah! This sounds pretty good. Yeah, he's okay. - I bet you could smoke him. - Absolutely. I'm playing at a fundraiser tomorrow night. Why don't you come see for yourself? All right. Sounds fun. - Hey. - Hey. Do you mind? That's it, let's go, girls! - Okay. - We're getting up there! Let's go! - I can't believe we're gonna do this! - You're going down. Come on, girls. Let's show them what we've got. Watch out, gorgeous. - What's your name? - I'm Jazzy. Of course, you are. - Morning. - Good morning. Jasmine! Let's begin. - Why didn't you wake me? - Are you kidding? You wouldn't budge. Retrouve! What time did you get in last night? You mean, this morning. Were you with that guy from the pub? His name's Paolo. He is so hot! He seemed crazy. And possibly, chemically altered. Yeah. But did you see his sexy bike? Will you stop talking there? Stretch. More, more! - Hey, don't you have that thing tonight with Kyle? -Yes. Now, would you be quiet? What are you going to wear? - I'll show you when we get home. - Oh. Absolutely not. - My wardrobe sucks. - I agree. Don't you have a sexy little dress? - That's black. - What's wrong with black? Everyone's going to be in black. You want to stand out! No, I didn't want to be flashy! I don't even know if this is a date! But the right dress could make it a date. Okay, nothing in here. Come on, we're going to have to go with my slam dunk. I'm sorry, it's just not a challenging piece of music. - Well, not for you. - Yeah, I know. Oh, wait a second, I'll be right back. I thought you were going solo tonight? Yeah, but I like to keep my options open. You're such a player! - Hi. - Hi. This is really nice. Yeah, well, I... My sponsor is putting it on some obligations through the whole. Dog and pony show. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, they're going to call me up to play in a second. - Oh, okay. -Yeah, I'll see you in a bit. But, um, mingle, have fun. ...our board members for arranging such a fabulous silent auction for us tonight. Make sure you all play for your generous bids. It's all for a good cause. Let me help you with that. Oh, it's... It's you. I take it you're not pleased to see me? Sorry, I'm just surprised. I didn't think you were the tux type. Me neither. You look stunning. Thank you. So, what are you doing here? I was invited by a friend from school. How about you? He could use a lap around the room. We've ran out of smoked salmon. Hello. Hayward, this is Ruby. - Ruby! Nice to meet you. - You too. - ...conservatory's most promising students. -Excuse me. Kyle Endecot. So, is he your date? Oh, um... I don't think so. You look like a young man who knows how to dance. I'm just a server. Well, you're on break now. Be a doll, please. Come on. Hi. - You want to dance with me? - Oh, please... Oh. - Oops. - Oh, sorry. - My goodness, you're an agile one. - Thank you. I try. Oh, no. I better save that poor girl from my blundering husband. Do you mind? Not at all. Thank you. Shall we? - Where did you learn to tango? - My grandmother. She must have been a good dancer. She was. The boy can move! So can his girl. So, you have a new job? Yes, I've been humble since our last meeting, which I want to apologize for. You don't have to do that. I was being pushy. I mean, I don't even know you. Do you want to? Excuse me, I think there are some dishes in the kitchen that need your attention. Come on, you don't have to dance with the help. Let go, Kyle, let go. - You heard her. - What did you say? - Please don't. -Wait, wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy who plays for money on the subway, right? That's right. Now, back off! What, you want to settle this outside? I'm fine to settle it right here. May I? What are you going to do? Pass around a hat? Whoa, oh, oh! - Excuse me, can I borrow this? - Sure. Take that, street hack. What? You think you're so tough? Please call security. - Go! - Back off! Go back to the subway, before I mop the floor with your face. - Security's here. -Yeah, you better get out of here. - What about you guys? -Don't worry, we're street dancers. We always piss someone off! Over here! Right now! - Let's go! - You better run! I'm going this way. Who are these people? We're the Switch Steps. And reach! Yes! Turn! Whoa! Turn! Up, stand! Turn! And... And yes! And now... Yes! Bravo! Ha! Good work, everyone. And you too, very good. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Ruby. - Is everything all right? - Yes. Just, I just want a little more time. You danced it beautifully. - I can do it better. -You're too hard on yourself. I just want to be perfect. And what happens when you've achieved perfection? You stop then? It's imperfections that keep us alive! Motivating us to push further and further. Come, let's try from the Developpe. Music. No, too square. Don't worry about technique now. Developpe and Plie. This is the problem. Stop trying to dance. But I'm a dancer. No, no, you're not a dancer in this variation. You're a gypsy! Proud, upright! You understand? Again. It's good now. Very good. Thank you. Ruby... each time you conquer a step, there will always be another challenge waiting. It's a long road. It never ends! As dancers, this is our journey. Hi. Hey. What are you doing here? Well... It appears, I've made an arse of myself for a second time. So, instead of saying "sorry" again, I've come to ask for a favor. Are you kidding me? No. I'd like to take you up on that very generous offer of that loaner violin. So, maybe I can enter the Peterson competition. You know, I don't think you have enough discipline to make that happen. Let me prove it to you. What do you say? You know, that was a really idiotic, macho stunt you pulled with Kyle. Yeah, I think he won that battle. Of course, I could make it up to you with an apology dinner? Do I have to change? I'll take you however I can get you. Eight o' clock, my place? I'll see you then. - Hey. - Hi. Is that Johnnie? Yeah. Definitely sexy fierce. Hello. Hi. So, this is your apology? Yeah. It's working. Did you cook? No, my man Krispy did. Oh. Thank you for coming. You're welcome. So, I saw you dancing for the first time today. Oh. Didn't know dance could be like that. So beautiful. I have this problem... letting go. Something you do really well. Apparently, too well. Sometimes. I brought you the violin. Thank you. You're a very generous person, you know that? Crazy idea. But there's this competition. And I need a dancer. Will you compete with me? - Of course I will. - Good. Shall we give it a go? That was beautiful. I like playing for you. - Hey! - Hi. See you later. - Hey. - Hey. Where have you been? I covered for you in class this morning. Thanks. I had a slow start. You look way too happy to be sewing that pointe shoe. What? You're glowing. - It's blinding me. - Stop it! Must have been some dinner you had. Okay, fine. If you're not going to tell me anything, I'm gonna go get coffee. - Hey. - Hi. I've been wanting to talk to you since the benefit. Your friend is quite a piece of work. To challenge me like that... Well, it takes two to tango. Funny. So, I heard you entered the String and Dance Competition with him. Mm-hmm. You do know he doesn't give a squat about playing classical violin, right? Well, you're entitled to your opinion. You should come dance in my team instead. That's sneaky, Kyle. Poaching other people's dancers. What can I say? I'm a competitive guy. Plus, you know, all the major dance companies will be at the performance. So, it really is in your best interest. That's pretty cold. Okay, then. I will take that as a no. Too bad. I guess April and I will have to annihilate you both... Take all the money, glory. Hi. You're on time. - You okay? - Yeah. We're up against Kyle and April. One of MCAs best dancers. It's all right. I've got a plan. What? So, you want us to dance with you in a classical shindig? Yes. Hell yeah! - Let's do this. - They're gonna love this show. Thanks for this opportunity. Point your toes! Do it again! We need to have a beefy bass drum. That's it. Girl, you so tight. That's not it. Go up. You wanna sit in that hip. - How much is this? - It's $125,000. Listen, is it really that much? I don't know! Yes! - No Mingazzi violin. - Thanks anyway. Look at that, you're such a show-off. I'm telling you, it's hard! - Whoa! - Whoa! Harder! Sharper! Don't just dance. Do it with feeling! - Hey! - Hi, there. - Are you ready? - Yeah. - Hello. - Hi. Don't wait up. Hey. You're too stiff. What's up with your roommate? Oh, she doesn't know how to have fun. But, you know, I do. So, where are we going? Don't worry. You're gonna love it. Move those hips! Short hands. Jasmine, I see you. Five, six, back up! Ruby, what are you doing? This is not ballet! Very good, April. Up! Jasmine, come here. You're late. You know the rules. Sit. And see Markova after class. You too, Ruby. All right, everyone else, I want you to do it again! Yes! Hit it! Ruby, short lines! Move it! What is going on with you two? What is going on with you two? You know that you are under more scrutiny than the dancers that pay full tuition. I understand that. - I can't tell you how much this scholarship means to me. -Me too. Ruby, there is no denying in your dedication. But we were hoping to see you making more progress in your Contemporary class. Unfortunately, it's not happening. So, we are placing you under review. As for you, Jasmine, I don't know what to say. You are one of our most talented dancers. And you work the least. Jasmine, this is your last warning. Next time you are late for a class, you will be expelled. That's all. What does it mean? It's to strike a note emphatically. And... this one? That is the date my grandfather died. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Everything is going to be okay. This competition is going to change everything. Hello. Hi, honey, it's me. Hi, mom. - Is something the matter? - No! Nothing, nothing, I'm good. Listen, I fixed it with work and they let me off. - You're coming? - Yes. - To the competition? - Yes. - They gave me the whole weekend. -Oh, mom, I am so excited. Yeah, me too! - Whoa! I'm late. - Oh! - Mom, I'll call you back, okay? - Okay. Jazzy, you got to get up. Come on, it's after 8:00. Stop it! - Leave me alone! - We have class. I don't know about you, but I am planning on keeping my scholarship. I'm sleeping! Ugh! Get off my bed, you bitch! I'm just... I'm sorry. I'm just so tired. Because you've been going to bed at 4:00 in the morning. I can't dance today. I don't feel well. What are you doing, Jazzy? I can't believe you're just going to throw everything away so you can party with this guy. Yeah, I like him! What about your dreams and everything, everything that you've worked for? Have you completely forgotten who you are? I'm a dancer. Then start acting like one. And get your butt out of bed. Dancers dance no matter what. Hey, there's Jazzy. Oh, look who decided to show up. That's right, April, you better watch your back 'cause I'm going to sweat all over it. That's just gross. You are coming to watch me and Kyle in the String and Dance Competition tomorrow, right? - Right. - Of course we're going. Have you seen Kyle and April's number? No. I heard they have some Joffrey dancers on their team. Oh! Excited? Yeah. And a little nervous! You guys are going to be great. Thanks. I wish you were dancing with us. Well, I should have said yes when you asked. I was an idiot. - Next year. - Yes! Oh! - Hello. - Hello. Ms. Adams? - This is Ruby. -Lenny here. The consignment store. - Listen, I got a surprise for you. -What? I got your boyfriend's fancy violin. You're kidding me? If you want it, you better come over and pick it up because I don't do home delivery, all right? Okay, I'll be right there. What is it? What happened? They found Johnnie's violin. Johnnie! Wassup, man? We're heading out to pick up the rest of the crew. - Yeah, see you at the theater? - Yeah. At 6:30. Don't be late. Yeah, right! We're about to kill it. Get out... Wish me luck. Hold on a second. I got eyes on him. Johnnie Blackwell? Yeah. This way, sir. This is so good. Really. This theater is beautiful! - And then, G8... - Excuse me. Has Johnnie Blackwell checked in? Blackwell? Go to the B... - No, sorry. - Nah, I don't see it. Thanks. No Johnnie? I don't get it. What did he say to you when you saw him? Just that he'll meet us here at 6:30. This isn't like Johnnie. Let's try him again. How long have you been in the US? I'm not sure. Let me help you. You seem nervous. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Peterson Foundation's String and Dance Competition. Five minute warning for Kyle and April. Five minutes. Listen, kid, this isn't about you. How well do you know this guy? Love to know. He scammed me out of five grand. Where can I get a hold of him? I don't know. Will you help us find him? Yes, but there's somewhere I really need to be right now. - Beautiful. - Impressive. So, what do we do now? That means we have to withdraw! Nah, it doesn't feel right. Johnnie wouldn't bail on us. Okay, we are ready for you guys. Let's go. Upstairs. We still have a few minutes. Let's go ahead and get ready, just in case. - Yeah, she's right. Come on. - Come on, guys. Hayward? I really hope this audience gets to see you guys dance. It's like you said, it ain't over yet. Okay, this group is up next. Okay, you guys ready? - Oh... - Johnnie made it! Yeah, we're ready. - I'm so sorry. - So close! - So close. - All right, we're ready now. Bravo! All right, let's rearrange the stands and chairs. Next, get ready for the lighting cue. Good luck beating that. Aha! Finally! Here we go. Let's do it, man. - You ready? - Absolutely. I think this might help. Where did you find it? Sometimes people can surprise you. Thank you. Our next contestant, playing his original composition, titled Fortando, violinist Johnnie Blackwell with dancers Ruby Adams and the Switch Steps. Where's the violinist? Where are the dancers? Completely indulgent. I disagree. Don't we want to evolve? Don't we want to progress? She's like a completely different dancer. She's not dancer. She's gypsy. Bravo! All right, we need all the contestants on stage. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patronage and support of this outstanding group of performers. After heated deliberation, we have made a decision. The winner of the Peterson Foundation String and Dance Competition is... Johnnie Blackwell and his dancer Ruby Adams, The Switch Steps... Congratulations, young man. You are the recipient of the $25,000 prize and a full scholarship to the Manhattan Conservatory of the Arts. Would you like to say a few words? Thank you so much. This means more to me than you know. I'd like to share the money with my brilliant crew, who I could not have done this without. Thank you for believing in me. Touche. Music will always be there running inside me. The difference is, now, I understand where it comes from. And I'm ready to share it.
