There was a time when the kingdom of Cornwall... lived in fear and trembling of the black prince Pendragon... master of all witches, giants, and hobgoblins... who ravaged the land. But at long last, Herla the wizard... drove Pendragon and all his witches from the kingdom... and exiled them beyond the reaches of the known world. Here, on a misty isle... uncharted and unknown... Pendragon schemed and waited for the day... when he would return to power in Cornwall. Then, after many years, the day came. It was a day of great rejoicing in Cornwall... and kings and princes bearing gifts... came to celebrate a special occasion. Know then, Princess Elaine... that as you are by the grace of God... the only child of our noble king... therefore I now place upon your head... this ancient coronet of the house of Cornwall. May you wear it in honor as befits our future queen. Rise, Elaine. Trumpeters, proclaim the festivities. Let the bells ring. Health and happiness to the princess Elaine! May she live to be a hundred years! For the great Elaine's birthday. Come on! Move aside! For your country! As the people of Cornwall celebrated, Pendragon arrived. Make way! And now the presentation of gifts! His Highness... Vallons, Duke of Normandy. His Excellency, the prince of Tarquin Isle... Elidorus. It is exquisite, King Meliodas. Elidorus? Know you this prince, Chancellor? Never have I heard the name... yet there's something faintly familiar if I can but recall. Your most gracious majesty King Mark... I apologize for the lateness of my arrival. Prince Elidorus? I cannot seem to remember. When was it that we met? We never have, Your Majesty. Yet you honor my daughter's birthday? I have always admired the crown of Cornwall. Therefore I took the liberty of bringing Her Royal Highness... a small, but unique gift. If you please, Garna. Certainly, master. Thank you, Prince. May I see what's inside? Allow me, Princess. A music box. He walks. Why, he could almost be alive. A nation merchant of whom I acquired him... spoke of a curious talent. Look, Father, what an unusual gift. I believe he wishes this dance. Certainly, my cavalier. Oh, you were wonderful. What an enchanting gift, Prince Elidorus. Enter. More gifts. Bring them over here. Put them on the table. Careful, now. You were lovely today, Princess. Your father was proud of you. I think my father is slightly prejudiced. It was nice to be remembered by so many people. One day, it'll be a crown you'll be wearing... the queen of a mighty kingdom. My father still has many good years ahead of him. I don't like to think about that day. Of course not. When you're young, it's only today that counts. Into bed with you. Good night, Princess. Sleep well, Lady Constance. A pity to shatter your innocent dreams, Princess Elaine... but the throne of Cornwall is to be mine... and only you can give it to me. Garna, quickly. Cormoran will meet you at the place appointed. Be assured, master. All will be as you wish. No! No! Princess! It's the princess! Something's happened to the princess! Guards! Guards! The princess! No! No! My daughter! Elaine! Elaine! Make room. Break it down. Elaine! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! A giant is running off with the princess! Alarm! Sound the alarm! Guards! Guards! Stop him! Stop him, men! Lower the gates! Drop the portcullis! Get him! Repair the bridge, men! Axes and poles! Guards, lend a hand! We can't let him out of our sight! It's been years since giants were banished. Why would they return now? Why? Come on, Jonathan, Tom. It's a beautiful day. OK, Tom. Come on, back. Back, back. Come on, Tom. Come on. What's the matter with you two this morning? We have to get that feed to town whether you like it or not. Now come on. No more nonsense. Back. What's going on around here? Well done, Cormoran. Leaving so soon, Princess? Why, your voyage has just begun. No, no, no! Let me go, please! Help! Who's to hear you, Princess? Now quiet! The master has planned... a nice long voyage for you, in honor of your birthday! Don't! Cormoran! Cormoran! Look out! Cormoran! Cormoran, after them! Head them off! Bring them back! Head them off! Quick, the loft! Look out! Run! Are you all right? You've done it. You killed him. It was nothing. I kill a giant every morning before breakfast. Starts my day right. I think you'd better put this on. You, farmer. Have you seen the princess? Your Majesty. Kneel, girl. It's the king. The princess, Your Majesty? Elaine. Young man... be good enough to come down from there with my daughter. Oh, l... I'm sorry, Princess. I didn't know. Well, young man? We mustrt keep the king waiting. Elaine. Father. The Lord has been merciful. Oh, father, this is the young man... who so bravely rescued me from the giant. Rise, my boy. Jack, Jack. Oh, Jack. You're safe. When I saw that horrible monster... Mother, this is the king. Your Majesty. Rise, madame. Forgive me. I was so thankful to see my son alive. I'm so thankful to see my daughter alive. Oh, poor child. I have some hot porridge on the fire. She'll need warmth and rest... before she returns to the castle. You've done a most remarkable deed, young man. Thank you, Your Majesty. I'm proud to serve the king as my father did. Your father served the crown? Yes, in the royal archers. He fell at the Battle of Land's End. A noble battle then, a noble battle now. Your father would have been proud of you this day. Come, let's have a look at your giant. Hideous creature. The boat... the strange boat that was taking the princess away. Hurry, Your Majesty. But it was... There it is... the small black craft. And there was a strange, dwarf-like man, Your Majesty. The servant, Garna. You know him, Sire? I know him... and his master. Master! Master! Master Pendragon! What happened? Calamity, O prince. Most fateful disaster. The princess... where is she? Cormoran is dead... slain by a young farmer. By now the princess is back in her father's castle. Impossible. You're lying. I tell the truth, master. I swear it. He took her from me at the boat and then killed the giant. I saw it with my own eyes. Blundering fool. A fury take you to your torment... all of you! I scheme a thousand nights... put the princess in your very hands. And you, imbecile, idiot... allow a mere farmer, a mortal, to defy me. We have failed, master. We have failed. But only for a moment. I shall have the princess, and the farmer shall die. By all the powers of darkness, he shall die. For returning to us the princess... alive and well... as by a miracle... and so delivering us from the ravages of our enemies... we dub thee Sir Jack... protector of the realm. Rise, Sir Jack. May you serve this court with honor... as did your father before you. - So be it. - Amen. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. What is it, Chancellor? We must talk privately at once. - Can't it wait? - This is very important. Very well. Attend Sir Jack, daughter. I'll return presently. Congratulations upon your knighthood, Sir Jack. - I'm so proud of you, Jack. - Sir Jack now. I'm honored to shake your hand, Sir Jack. At long last, a hero in the court who is young. And handsome. It's a bit warm here. Would you mind seeing me to the terrace, Sir Jack? Certainly, Princess. Thank you for rescuing me. You saved my life once, remember? Hail to Sir Jack. To Jack the Giant Killer. Hail, Sir Jack! Hail, Sir Jack. I think my rescuer has acquired a new name. I seem to have acquired more than a new name. It's a great honor. I only hope I can be won'thy of it. That's my father's way of thanking you. This is mine. I shall immediately go out and find another giant to slay. Before breakfast? "Know also that these ageless giants with horns... "and satyr-like features... "who roam our Cornwall countryside... "destroy and plunder... "at the bidding of their master, Pendragon." These records were lost among the archives... of your father's reign. I've only just uncovered them. Then this Prince Elidorus is really Pendragon in disguise. The prince of witches. But why would he want to seize the princess? Why? If we knew that, we'd know what to do. There's only one thing we can do. We were fortunate this time... but Pendragon is certain to make another attempt. I'm going to entrust you with the most important mission... ever given to a Cornish knight... to protect the life of the princess until she's safe. I will certainly try to be won'thy of your trust, Sire... but is one guard enough? Our only defense is secrecy. There aren't enough men in all Cornwall... to protect the life of the princess... should her whereabouts become known to Pendragon. At dawn, you and Elaine, disguised as peasants... will travel to a convent in Normandy. When the princess is safely within its walls... you will return here. That means I'm to live in exile. It won't be easy, Father. Believe me, Elaine, it's the only way. Very well, Father. I'm ready to do whatever's best. Go now. Prepare yourself for the journey. Good night, Father. Good night, my dear. We have plans to make. The dawn comes much too soon. You'd better go now. It's getting late. Is there anything more I can do for you, mistress? No, nothing more, Lady Constance. I shall miss you. And I shall pray for your safe journey. We'll send word as soon as it's safe to return to Cornwall. Take care of her, Jack. No one will harm her while I live, Your Majesty. Quiet, Gaunt, quiet. We have a mission for you at last... a most interesting mission. Patience, patience. Patience. Fly straight and true, Gaunt. Our master will be most eager for your message. Master. Master! Black prince! Look! It has come from the castle. So you finally decided to visit us, eh, Gaunt? Bringing a little present. She sails with the morning tide. What kind of a voyage is it to be, eh, Tubo? Smooth and tranquil? All right, lads, bear a hand on that halyard! You, man, lay a hand there! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Lay your backs into it, lads! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! How goes it, Captain? Fair skies and a spankir breeze. No man could ask for better. I haven't seen miss Elaine since mid-mornir. Nor I. She's not in her cabin. Probably with the helmsman. Come on, mind the wheel, Jack. Peter! Aye, Father. Have you seen our lady passenger? Aye. She's here with me. Well, come up and lend a hand, lad. - We've got a landfall to make. - Aye, Captain. He's a fine lad, your son. That he is. And smart as paint. And he can haul a jib as proper as any man aboard. Here you are, son. Take over the helm. I'll get a bite to eat. Jack, you can give Miss Elaine... her first glance at the continent. Thank you, Captain. Oh, you can see much better from up there, off the larboard. Helmsman, keep her teeth in the wind. Aye, Captain. I didn't realize we were so close to shore. This makes it even closer. Do you want to look? It's already too close. Soon I'll be in the convent, and you'll be going back. I'll be alone. The sisters will take good care of you. It's been such a wonderful voyage... just the two of us. I wish I didn't have to go in hiding... that I could stay as a make-believe peasant girl. I wish I were a genie to make your wish come true. Suppose you were? What would you do? I would turn myself into a great prince... and I would search every farm and village of England... until I found you. Then I would hold you and tell you that I love you. And I would answer that I love you. But it wouldn't be make-believe, Jack, because it's true. And then we'd fly away on my magic carpet... and live happily together forever after. Jack. All right, lads! Heave! - Heave! - Ho! - Heave! - Ho! All right, lay your backs to it, lads! - Heave! - Ho! - Heave! - Ho! - Heave! - Ho! - Heave! - Ho! Pipe the captain! All hands lay to! What happened? Captain! Rocks, Captain. We've run aground. Mid-channel? There are no rocks here. All hands lay to! - Are you all right, lad? - Aye. What did we hit? I don't know. Look at the sky. It's turning dark. And we've stopped moving. 'Tis unnatural. Captain, look aloft! Witches! Witches! Witches! Who is it, Captain? This witch is accursed. - It's the work of the devil. - It's the devil himself. Devil or witch or whatever you are! You may have the wind on me now, but you'll not scuttle my ship. Captain! Witches! Witches! We're doomed! - Run for you lives! - Witches, witches! - Witches! - Come with me. Peter, up here! Witches! Father, here. Lock the door and let no one in. Witches! Witches! Witches! A witch! Captain! Captain! More witches on the quarter deck. Witches! Sail across my bow, will you? Father! Father! Jack! Jack, Jack! Look! Jack! Jack, Jack! No! Elaine! The witches! They're going! Father! We're moving. Look, it's getting light. Captain. Let's head for home! They mustrt turn back the ship. Captain! Back to England it is, lads. Make ready to come about. Bosun, I'm taking command of this ship. Oh, you are? You hear that, lads? Our passenger's taking command of the ship. - In His Majesty's name. - In His Majesty's name. And where would our Royal Highness wish us to sail him? We're going to save the girl. His Majesty can have this blasted tub... as soon as we're safe ashore at Cornwall. As for me, I'll not sail in the wake of those accursed witches. Turn to, we're comir about. Listen, you men! Sail to England... and you'll all swing from the gallows! Elaine is the royal princess of Cornwall! Aye, and I'm the caliph of Baghdad. Well, then, throw him overboard! Over the side! Over the side! I'll get ya! Jack, Jack! Jack! O Isis... keeper of the magic flame... behold thy shrouded minions... demons of the dark assembled... to prepare before the altar of thy eternal flame... a neophyte to serve thee in thy mystic labyrinth. Behold... O Isis... the eye of ancient Egypt. Arumah... Barabas, Urgat. Maruga... Maroya, Garat. Awake, Princess of Cornwall. Open thine eyes. Gaze deep within the sacred orb of egypt. Bathe your innermost soul in the magic flame. Now let the blood in your veins... intermingle with the blood... of the ancient spirits of the dark nether world. Behold yourself in the mirror. Now, are you one of the mystic coven of witches. The court of His Exalted Majesty... King Mark of Cornwall is now in session. Let the stranger approach the throne. Pendragon. You dare to come here? Guards! I detect a chill in your hospitality... but perhaps Your Majesty does not wish to hear... of the whereabouts of the royal princess. He couldn't possibly know about Elaine. Approach the throne. Thank you, Your Majesty. Speak forth, black prince. I merely wish to inform Your Majesty... that your daughter did not reach the convent as you planned. What have you done with her? Where is she? Only I know that. I don't believe you. You're lying. Do you think so? Behold. Elaine. Elaine. Do you really think I am so stupid... as to bring the girl herself? That illusion was merely to prove to you... that I have her in reality. My daughter... is she safe? Perfectly. At my castle. What is it that you want of me? My terms are simple... merely that you abdicate within a week. You may take your chancellor and any aides that you require... and leave England, never to return. But who will rule my country, govern my people? You? On the contrary. The next in legal succession will ascend the throne. Her coronation will take place... immediately after your abdication. You mean my daughter will become queen? You see? My terms are generous, are they not? With you by her side to advise her. That may be as may be. You have one choice to make, King Mark. Your daughter or your throne. In a week, I shall return for your answer. You hold my daughter, witch, but we hold you. Seize him! One week, King Mark... no more. How could he have known of our plans? Outside of the two of us... Lady Constance! Except for the princess and Jack... only we three knew we were sending Elaine away. Surely, you don't think it was l... - Look into that mirror. - No, no! According to legend, if you're a witch... the mirror will reflect your true soul! All right, it was I who told the master. Break the mirror! Break the spell! Oh, forgive me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Forgive me, forgive me. We do not blame you, Constance. Forgive me. We pity you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ahoy on board! Help! Ahoy! Help! Strange fish in the sea today. Here, drink. All of it. It's good, Sigurd, after it's down. We were trying to remember if you'd ever seen these witches. Oh, the witches. Yeah. Ah, I sailed these waters under Eric the Red. Sailed in fifty ships, we did, to conquer Ireland. Oh, it was wonderful... the fighting, the plundering. Yes, but did you ever see the witches? Oh, the witches, the witches. These old eyes have seen many strange sights. Once when Eric the Red and I were sailing south... we saw a school of dragons in the sea. Yes, but these witches were in the sky... and their leader had three horns on his head. And he carried a pitchfork. A pitchfork. That shot blue flames. Blue flames. Sounds like Tubo the warlock to me... Pendragors witch from across the sea. - What was that? - The imp of the bottle. I fished him up in my nets one day. He claims to have great powers, but he will do nothing for me. Have a care! Just a moment! You ugly mean devil! Couldrt you wait? I asked for nothing. And nothing you'll get, you murderous Viking. Me power's reserved for one to me liking. A little toy man. Insulting a leprechaun. A toy, you say? Oh, for that there'll be the devil to pay. Now hush up and listen. Jack here is a good and true lad with... with a just cause. There's a princess to be rescued from the witches... and I need help. A noble aim, if spoken true. Pick up the bottle... I dare you to. A caution... if you've told a lie... the glass will glow, and your hand will fry. Faith, and after a thousand years... at last an honest man appears. Have you been in there that long? He was imprisoned by the king of elves... for dabbling in the black arts. I'd finished me work, me shoes heeled and sewn. All I did was to make me these boots out of gold. Not just boots, seven-league boots. Made out of the old pot of gold, you baboon... to go around the world and over the moon. You'll help me, then? These magic coins will aid your mission... if you'll agree to one condition. When they're gone, there are only three... you'll smash the glass and set me free. It's a bargain, then. For his island we'll sail to twist Pendragors tail And the princess we'll save from that horrible knave I'm off on a fling, I'll get out of this thing A free man I'll be, oh, tralura tralee At least we're here, thanks to the imp. Now to find out where he's hiding Elaine. You think it wise for you to go alone? I think there's less chance of being discovered. Suppose you're caught, Jack? We'll see if our little friend here... is as good as he says he is. Who led you safely across the brine? You do your part, I'll do mine. I'll put my trust in that sword. We'll see. Remember to put some fresh water aboard. Be careful, Jack. Good luck. We don't often have visitors. A clever lad. How would he fair, do you suppose... against our castle's defenses? It would be a most diverting spectacle to see. You cannot fight these men with stone. Look about you, seize a bone. A bone, to fight them? A bone to fight their magic might. A bone to get a fairer fight. Don't be asking questions, dunce. Seize the bone... now, at once. Thanks, imp. Thank me later, on the ship. Right now, get cracking with that whip. A magic whip. This alters things. He must be dealt with differently. Enter, lad. Enter. Don't look back in that direction. I'll take care of your protection. Welcome to castle Pendragon. I had a sample of your welcome outside. I must compliment you on your valor, young man. First you vanquished Cormoran, my giant. Then you found your way to this island... a feat in itself. And just now you lashed at and destroyed my dragon men... with your magic whip... a stroke of genius. A real tragedy to have come so far only to suffer failure. You're so sure I have failed? I am, indeed. For you see, if you take one step toward me... horns will sprout from your head. A second step, and you will develop cloven hooves... and walk on all fours. A third step... and the transformation will be complete. You will have become a black ram. So, you see? Your sword can be an antidote... to givir you a cashmere coat. Hold it 'fore you as you go, hilt above and point below. No horns. No hooves. No wool. Defeated, did you say, witch? Please, let us dispense with theatricalities. My powers are obviously completely without effect... against your own. Therefore, I yield to the inevitable. I'm curious, how do you acquire such potent forces? - The princess. - She is not here. - Produce her, or die. - She's not in the castle. Then where? On the other side of the island... there are the ruins of a little Roman temple. She is imprisoned there. Have her brought to me at once. If you wish to free the princess... you must go there. How do I know I can trust you? Arert we rather forced to trust each other? There seems no other way. Very well. But make no attempt to trick me. Master, your magic... what's happened? Princess! Out of my way, you yelping dogs, and let me think. Never have I failed to turn a mere mortal... into a cringing beast. But he was able to withstand the strength of my magic. It was the sword, master. The burning sword. It was not only the sword, you fool. Have you forgotten the magic whip? He has a strange power... perhaps some ancient talisman of the black arts. We must find the secret of this power. Perhaps I can help. He doesn't know I'm one of you. Perhaps you can. - Garna. - Yes, master. Take her to the ruined temple. Yes, master. There you will appear to him as the princess Elaine. Princess. It's all right. - Jack. - You're safe now. Dear Jack, I prayed you'd come. I have a boat on the beach... waiting to take us back to England. Can you walk? I'll be all right. Ahoy, Sigurd! Peter! The cask is gone. They must still be looking for water. Well, they'll be returning soon. I'd better make ready to sail. I never thought I'd see you again, Jack... or that I'd ever leave this island alive. We had the luck of the Irish on our side. Surely it would take more than luck to defeat Pendragon. Luck and the secret of my magic weapon. You mean this? The sword? No. That's just Sigurd's rusty old blade. I was talking about my friend, the imp of the bottle. He's a leprechaun, imprisoned in the bottle by a magic spell. We both owe him everything. Oh, such pretty words you'd better say... till we are safe and far away. Is there something wrong, Princess? I guess... being chained out there for so long... I'm cold. We can wait in the cabin. This'll warm you. Is there anything... some hot tea to drink? Well, this brew of Sigurd's... isn't exactly fit for a princess... but it is warming. I'll pour it. Get another cup, Jack. We'll drink together to our escape from this island. That I will gladly do. I wish Peter were here to celebrate with us. Yes, and Sigurd, too. You'll like him. Thank you, Princess. To a safe voyage home. And to us. To a happy future. You and I together, Jack... To a happy future. You and I together, Jack... for the rest of our lives. To us. To us. All right, to us. Oh, it's strange to feel happy... at a time like this, but when we sail... What's the matter, Jack? I don't know. Suddenly I feel strange, as if... I were going to... Fresh air. She must be evil, the bottle's hot. She pretends to be what she is not. Watch it there! Don't rock the ship! Saints preserve us, I'm going to slip! Ahoy on board. Sigurd! Jack. Jack! Sigurd, come here, quick! Your imp stands between me and the throne of Cornwall. Where is he? You have great magic powers. Find him yourself. Yes. I will. Only twice in my existence have I been thwarted... once by Herla the wizard... and this second time by you. Herla is dead. Yes, and I will die, too, rather than betray my king. I shall hope to make you change your mind. Garna. Yes, master. Peter. Sigurd. For the last time, where is the imp? Release the Viking. I am afraid you were not sufficiently impressed... on your first visit. I'll give you a new demonstration of my powers. Sigurd! Now... the boy. Look at me. Look at me! Stop it! Jack! Peter! Wait! Jack, tell him, please! I can't. Look at me. Peter! Peter! And now, my dear, you are next. What do you suppose would be most fitting? A serpent? Or perhaps a toad? Or would you prefer to tell me where you have hid the imp? Your loyalty to your king is touching... but your allegiance to the princess is another matter. You have... you have until these sands run out... to convince your knight that he is being most unwise. Garna. I advise you, consider carefully. Please, Jack, tell him where you hid the imp. You've got to to save us all. Is that why you drugged me, to get the imp? I did it to save your life. He threatened to kill you if I refused. He was watching every move. He'll kill you now if you don't tell him where you hid the imp. Then I'll have to die because I don't know where the imp is. You really don't know? It's the truth, Princess. I don't know. You were a fool to come here, Jack. Your fate was sealed the moment you set foot on this island. The only thing that kept you alive was the imp. As soon as the master returns, you die, all of you. Princess, you are bewitched. Break the mirror before it's too late. Break the spell he cast over you. Untie me! Help me before it's too late! And what would you save me from, Prince Charming... my reflection? Look at me. Gaze upon my true self. Am I not beautiful? Why be the princess of Cornwall... when I can be queen of all England? Think of it. How exciting. A witch on the throne of England. I forgot. Pity you won't be there. Peter! Peter! That's right. Come over here and untie me. Over here! Untie me quickly! No! No! No! Get away from there. Get back in your cage. Please, let him be! Master! Pendragon, help! Help me! Pendragon! Master! Help me! Help! Master! Master! No! No! Master! No, please! No! Sorry, Princess. Master! Forgive me. Forgive me. Garna, quickly. Pendragon. Master, the cage... it's empty, too. This would explain it. Flaming gauntlets live. Fight. Wait. There's a secret passage out of the castle this way. Hurry. No matter. They cannot reach the boat. Jack! Jack! Come back! The boat is just beyond those rocks. Run for the rocks. It's a matter of a few moments now. At least we're safe in here. Not at high tide. Ahoy there, you, whoever you be! Get me out of this boilir sea! The imp. Peter, give it to me, quick. Hurry, imp, your last good deed. Do it now. Please, hurry. Beware of her. She'll change your features... like she did those other creatures. She was under Pendragors spell... but it's broken now. Hurry! Your magic! In all the kingdom under the sea... there's just one creature might set you free. Well, throw the coin. Call him. Master, they're making for the boat. Out of my way! Master, they're escaping! Give me room! Can't you help us, just once more? Oh, I would if I could, but you've had your three. Look at me purse. It is empty, see? No! Jack! Jack, help! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack? Peter. Sigurd. How wonderful. - Jack, come on! - Come on! - Come on. - Come on. Come on. Sigurd. Ahh, Peter, you're restored, too. When you killed Pendragon, it broke the spell over us. And look at his castle. Destroyed forever. You'll find dry clothes in the cabin. Just a minute. I have a promise to fulfill. You got a hammer? Here. See? Be careful. Don't hurt him. Will you be still and calm your fears? I've been waitir ten hundred years. Now, watch the glass. Just a minute. Have a care. The bottle... turn it, give me air! Sorry, I was only... Never mind the lame excuse! Break the glass and then let me loose! Little imp, you're free! Free at last, to breathe and bend... thanks to you, me noble friend. For you, Elaine, some sound advice. Opportunity knocks, but never twice. So if it's happiness you'd woo... marry Jack. He's the lad for you. I intend to. The little people are waitir for me... in Ireland there, across the sea. Ah, it is a beautiful place, the fairest of fair... and me seven-league boots will get me there. So bless you all and have no fear. Your course for home will soon be clear. He's gone. What did he mean about our course? Look! Over there, in the sky! If your homeward way you'd wend... follow the rainbow to its end. - Good-bye, imp! - Good-bye, imp! Good luck! He was a loyal friend. I'll miss him. Uh, come boy, we must get on our course. She doesn't answer to the helm very well. Oh, she will do to get us back to England. To England... and home.
