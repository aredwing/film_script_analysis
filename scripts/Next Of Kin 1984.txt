I AM NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU ANYMORE. -PETER WILL HEAR US QUARRELLING, AND HE SHOULDN'T. -LET HIM HEAR US QUARREL. -HE SHOULD BE HEARING US TRYING TO INSTIL SOME VALUES IN HIM, GET THROUGH TO HIM ABOUT WHA HE'S GONNA DO WITH HIS LIFE. -I SAY HE SHOULD BE HEARING ME. I THINK IT'S TIME-- -HE'S HEARING YOU. BUT I THINK HE'S HEARING THE WRONG THINGS FROM YOU. -MY GOD! WHAT A LIFE THIS IS. WHY DO I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS? I HAVE TO GO TO WORK THIS MORNING. ( Spanish guitar music) -MY NAME IS PETER. I'M 23 YEARS OLD, AND I'VE LIVED AT HOME ALL MY LIFE... WATCHING MY PARENTS DISLIKE EACH OTHER. FOR A WHILE, I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PRETTY EXCITING THING TO DO. BUT IN THE PAST YEAR OR SO, IT'S ALL BEGUN TO GET ON MY NERVES. SO WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING INSTEAD IS SPENDING A LO OF MY TIME... PRETENDING. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ( aII singing ) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR PETER HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU Peter: I FIGURED OU A LONG TIME AGO THAT BEING ALONE WAS EASIER IF YOU BECAME... TWO PEOPLE. ONE PART OF YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME, LIKE AN AUDIENCE, AND THE OTHER PART WOULD TAKE ON DIFFERENT ROLES, KIND OF LIKE AN ACTOR. -NOW BEFORE WE START, I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THOSE CAMERAS. THEY'LL BE VIDEOTAPING OUR CONVERSATION. AFTER THIS MEETING, I'D LIKE EACH OF YOU TO VIEW THE TAPE, SOMETIME OVER THE NEXT WEEK. NOW IT'S IMPORTAN THAT YOU WATCH IT ALONE. USE ONE OF OUR ROOMS ON THE NINTH FLOOR. THEN, WHEN WE MEET AGAIN, WE CAN TALK ABOUT YOUR REACTIONS TO WHAT YOU SEE, AND WHAT YOU THINK OF THE WAY YOU'RE BEHAVING. OKAY? GOOD. -IS THAT S YSTEM HOOKED UP TO A... A S YNCHRONIZING GENERATOR? -YES. NOW... GOOD. COULD SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT'S BROUGHT YOU HERE? -RIGHT NOW, OUR BIG PROBLEM IS WITH PETER. HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING WITH HIMSELF. -IS THAT RIGHT, PETER? -I GUESS, YEAH. -WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY? -HE PRETENDS. -IS THAT RIGHT, PETER? DO YOU MAKE-BELIEVE? -SOMETIMES. -WHY? YOU ENJOY IT? -I GUESS, YEAH. -DO YOU HAVE MANY FRIENDS? WHY NOT? -I... I FIND IT DIFFICUL TO COMMUNICATE SOMETIMES. -ARE YOU LONELY? HOW OLD ARE YOU? -HE'S 23. -I ASKED PETER. IS THAT RIGHT? ARE YOU 23? -YES. -DOES YOUR MOTHER USUALLY ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR YOU? -SOMETIMES. -A LOT OF THE TIME? WHAT TIME DO YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING? -HE USUALLY SLEEPS IN. -DO YOU STAY UP LATE? THEN WHY DO YOU SLEEP SO MUCH? MR. FOSTER, WHAT TIME DO YOU USUALLY GET UP? -OH, AT A QUARTER TO SIX, SIX O'CLOCK. -YOU GO TO WORK? -YES. -IS IT A GOOD JOB? -OH, YES! -AND YOU WORK HARD AT IT? -YES. -TAKE A CERTAIN PRIDE IN WHAT YOU DO? -UH-HUH. -THEN HOW IS I THAT YOU'VE RAISED A SON THAT DOESN'T WANT TO WORK, HAS NO PRIDE AND PRETENDS THAT HE'S SOMEBODY ELSE ALL THE TIME? -I-- -IS IT NECESSARY TO BE SO BLUN ABOUT ALL OF THIS? -MAYBE PETER'S TRYING TO REJECT YOUR VALUES. IS THAT IT, PETER? YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE YOUR PARENTS? -OH, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THEM. -YOU LOVE THEM? -HMM. -VERY MUCH? ( Hearing voices ) Peter: LOOKING BACK ON OUR SESSIONS AT THE FAMILY CLINIC, I'VE COME TO REALIZE SOMETHING: I ENVY THERAPISTS. I MEAN, WHAT CAN BE MORE EXCITING THAN... THAN GETTING TO KNOW ANOTHER FAMILY, TRYING TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS? WHAT CAN BE MORE SATISFYING THAN... THAN GIVING DIRECTION TO OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES? Father: I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS. I HAVE TO GO TO WORK IN THE MORNING. YES, YOU HAVE, GARY, IF WE WAN TO GET THROUGH TO EACH OTHER... AND THROUGH OUR SON. -THIS IS A WASTE OF MY TIME. -SO HOW'S YOUR FAMILY? -NOT BAD. AND YOURS? -SO SO... YOU KNOW. -HOW'S YOUR MOTHER COMING ALONG? -SHE'S BETTER. -AND YOUR WIFE? -SHE TOLD ME SHE SPEN THE WEEKEND WITH ANOTHER MAN. -YOU'RE JOKING. -THEN TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE. -HOW ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND? -OH, HE'S GREAT. VERY COOPERATIVE, VERY... OPEN ABOUT HIS FEELINGS, YOU KNOW. -WELL, THAT'S A START. -YEAH, I SUPPOSE. -I OWE TO SHOW YOU MY FAMILY SOMETIME. -DO YOU HAVE MUCH TAPE OF THEM? -SIX HOURS. -COLOUR? -BLACK AND WHITE. BUT I SHOT IT IN ROOM 304. -SO YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT-- -OH, THE LIGHTING IS AS EVEN AS YOU CAN HOPE FOR. -IT'S SO HARD TO GE THE FLESH TONES. -CAN I HELP YOU? -YES. I'M HERE TO SEE A TAPE. -WHICH ONE? -FOSTER. -THERE YOU GO, DOCTOR. -YOU'RE NEW HERE, AREN'T YOU? -YES. I'M WORKING HERE THIS MORNING. MISS MINUCHIN HAD A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT. -NOTHING SERIOUS, I HOPE? -SHE HAD TO GET HER TEETH FIXED. -AH... AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME? -LIZA. -LIZA... MY NAME IS TED, BUT MOST PEOPLE AROUND HERE CALL ME TEDDY. -WELL, I'M ONLY HERE THIS MORNING. -OH, CALL ME TEDDY WHILE YOU'RE HERE. -ROOM 153 IS FREE. -THANKS, LIZA. -YOU'RE WELCOME... TEDDY. Mother: HE DOESN'T WAN TO DO ANYTHING WITH HIMSELF. Therapist: WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY? DO YOU HAVE MANY FRIENDS? ARE YOU LONELY? HOW OLD ARE YOU? DOES YOUR MOTHER USUALLY ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR YOU? THEN HOW IS IT THA YOU'VE RAISED A SON THAT DOESN'T WANT A JOB, HAS NO PRIDE, AND PRETENDS THA HE'S SOMEBODY ELSE? -IS IT NECESSARY TO BE SO BLUNT ABOUT ALL THIS? -MAYBE PETER IS TRYING TO REJECT-- Peter: FOR 23 YEARS, I'VE BEEN RAISED AS MY PARENTS' PRIDE AND JOY. THAT'S GOTTA CHANGE. I WANT CONTROL NOW. -HI, SARAH. HOW ARE THINGS OUT THERE? THIS IS A TAPE OF THE SESSION THA I MENTIONED TO YOU IN MY LETTER. I'VE INCLUDED A FILE ON THE FAMILY, WHICH WILL HELP TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF THEIR BACKGROUND. AS YOU'LL SEE, THERE'S A GHOS MEMBER THAT I'M DEALING WITH HERE: A SON WHO WAS GIVEN UP FOR ADOPTION. THOUGH THE SHAPE OF THE ABSENT CHILD PLACED A STRESS ON THE FAMILY'S EQUILIBRIUM, THIS SESSION PROVED QUITE EFFECTIVE IN RELEASING THE TYRANNY OF THEIR MISSING SON. I HOPE YOU FIND IT HELPFUL. WHY DO YOU THINK YOUR DAUGHTER LEFT HOME? -BECAUSE SHE DON'T RESPECT ME, THAT'S WHY. -WHY DO YOU THINK SHE DOESN'T RESPECT YOU? -BECAUSE SHE AC LIKE A BIG SHOT. -IN WHAT WAY? -THE WAY SHE DRESSES. LOOK AT HER. -IS THAT ALL YOU'RE ANGRY ABOUT, GEORGE? HER CLOTHES? -SHE DRESS LIKE A... LIKE A WHORE. -DO YOU THINK SHE'S A WHORE? WHEN YOU TALK, DO YOU LISTEN TO HER? -YES. -SHE DOESN'T THINK THAT YOU DO. -SHE DON'T LISTEN TO ME! -THEN WHY DO YOU TREAT HER LIKE A CHILD? -BECAUSE SHE MAKE ME ANGRY. -HOW? -HUH... JUST... SHE JUST... SHE JUST DOES. -ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT ANGRY ABOUT YOUR SON, GEORGE? ABOUT BEDROS? ARE YOU SORRY THAT HE'S NOT HERE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER, TO FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS? ARE YOU ANGRY WITH AZAH BECAUSE SHE REJECTS THE VALUES YOU BELIEVE YOUR SON WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED? YOU GAVE YOUR SON AWAY WHEN YOU CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. -WE HAD NO MONEY. -SO YOU GAVE HIM AWAY. A FEW YEARS LATER, YOU HAD A DAUGHTER. YOU KEPT HER. SHE'S IN THIS ROOM WITH US RIGHT NOW. DOES THAT UPSET YOU? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, SONYA? -I WANT US TO BE HAPPY. -ALL RIGHT. LET'S PLAY A LITTLE GAME. I WANT US TO PRETEND THAT I'M YOUR SON. THAT I'M BEDROS. LET'S SAY THAT I'VE JUST COME INTO THIS ROOM. HI, SONYA. HI, GEORGE. AREN'T YOU GONNA HUG ME? ARE YOU AFRAID THAT I WON' LISTEN TO YOU EITHER? DO YOU THINK THA I'LL FIND YOU IGNORANT? THAT I'LL BE EMBARRASSED BY YOUR ACCENT? WELL, I AM. YOU'RE JUST A LOUS Y FOREIGNER, A LOUS Y PEASANT! NO WONDER PEOPLE DON' TRUST YOU... YOU SMELL! -GEORGE! GEORGE! -DON'T HIT ME, GEORGE! GO ON, HIT YOUR SON AS HARD AS YOU WANT! Dr. Sarah: DID EVERYONE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE TAPE FROM OUR LAST MEETING? GOOD. WELL, LET'S STAR WITH YOU, PETER. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF WHAT YOU SAW? -WELL, I THOUGHT YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -WELL, OF POINTING OU WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE. YOU DISPLAYED A GREA SENSITIVITY. VERY POLISHED. -AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS? -OH, THAT'S OBVIOUS: I'M JUST BORED. -NOW PETER, DON'T SAY THAT. -NO. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME. -DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE THINGS? -YES. -SO WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO? -WELL, I THOUGHT I'D, YOU KNOW, GO AWAY FOR A WHILE... BE ALONE. FEEL LIKE I'M RESPONSIBLE. -I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO FINANCE SUCH A TRIP? -WELL, NOW I DON'T KNOW... -YES, OF COURSE. -GOOD. I'D LIKE YOU TO KEEP A DIARY WHILE YOU'RE AWAY. HAVE YOU EVER KEPT ONE BEFORE? -NO. -IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WRITTEN. YOU CAN SPEAK I INTO A TAPE RECORDER. PRETEND YOU'RE TALKING TO A STRANGER, TELLING YOUR THOUGHTS TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW. THEN, WHEN YOU RETURN, WE CAN ALL LISTEN TO THE TAPE AND DISCUSS IT. OKAY? -SURE. -HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO GO? -MY NAME IS PETER. I'M 23 YEARS OLD AND I'VE LIVED AT HOME ALL MY LIFE, WATCHING MY PARENTS DISLIKE EACH OTHER. FOR A WHILE, I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PRETTY EXCITING THING TO DO. BUT IN THE PAST YEAR OR SO, IT'S ALL BEGUN TO GET ON MY NERVES. SO WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING INSTEAD IS SPENDING A LO OF MY TIME PRETENDING, JUST TO GET MY MIND OFF THINGS. LATELY THOUGH, MY MOTHER HAS CAUGHT ME AT IT A COUPLE OF TIMES. I THINK IT REALLY BOTHERS HER. SO ONE DAY, WE ALL WENT TO SEE THIS FAMILY THERAPIST, AND WITH HIS ENCOURAGEMENT, I DECIDED TO TAKE THIS LITTLE TRIP. SO HERE I AM. LOOKING BACK ON OUR SESSIONS AT THE CLINIC, I'VE COME TO REALIZE SOMETHING: I ENVY THERAPISTS. IT MUST BE REALLY EXCITING GETTING INVOLVED WITH ANOTHER FAMILY, TRYING TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS. WHAT CAN BE MORE SATISFYING THAN GIVING DIRECTION TO OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES? IT MUST GIVE ONE A REAL SENSE OF PURPOSE. FOR 23 YEARS, I'VE BEEN RAISED AS MY PARENTS' PRIDE AND JOY. BUT THAT'S GOTTA END. I WANT CONTROL NOW. HELLO... IS THIS THE DERYAN RESIDENCE?... YES. UH... THIS IS GOING TO COME AS SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE TO YOU, BUT... I'M YOUR SON... NO, NO. NO, I'M NOT JOKING... YES, YOUR SON... BEDROS? YES... WELL, I'D... I'D LIKE TO MEET YOU. -WE' WAITING SOMEONE. -I KNOW. -BEDROS! -BEDROS! BEDROS. BEDROS. -BEDROS. -YOUR HAIR USED TO BE DARKER. -DID IT? -AS BLACK AS YOUR MOTHER. -YOU'RE SO SKINNY. IT USED TO FILL MY FINGERS. SKINNY LIKE YOUR GRANDFATHER. DON'T YOU THINK, GEORGE, HE LOOKS LIKE HIS GRANDPA? -MORE LIKE HIS UNCLE. SO YOU KEEP YOUR NAME, HEY, BEDROS? -YEP. -YOU'RE PROUD OF IT. -OF COURSE HE'S PROUD. -YEAH, BUT SOME CHANGE THEIR NAMES. -NOT OUR SON. -BEDROS... ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE US? -YOU BET. ( praying ) WE THANK FOR THIS MEAL AND THE RETURN OF OUR SON BEDROS. GOD, HE GIVE HIS SON JESUS TO BE KILLED TO PAY FOR SIN. AMEN. -AMEN. -SONYA, BEDROS... BEDROS, WELCOME. ( Armenian ) -IT USED TO BE YOUR FAVOURITE. -I DIDN'T HAVE TEETH THEN, DID I? -I MASH IT. I MASH IT LIKE PUDDING. YOU ATE IT ALL UP. YOU NEVER MAKE A MESS. YOU WERE SUCH A GOOD BABY. WASN'T HE, GEORGE? -HUH? HUH. -YOU NEVER CRIED. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SCARED OR YOU'RE HUNGRY, YOU NEVER CRY. -EVEN WHEN I HIT HIM, HE NEVER CRY. -SO... DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER CHILDREN? -WE HAD A DAUGHTER. -AND YOU GAVE HER UP, TOO? -WE DON'T GIVE YOU UP. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. NO MONEY, NO DOCTOR... NO FRIENDS, NO HOUSE. WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO? LET YOU STARVE? -I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY. -IT WAS ONLY THING TO DO. -SO... WHERE IS MY SISTER? -SHE LEFT HOME. -WHEN? -TWO MONTHS AGO. -DOES SHE KNOW I'M HERE? WELL, I'D LIKE TO MEET HER. -SHE WILL NEVER COME INTO THIS HOUSE AGAIN! ( Listening to himseIf ) IT'S A BIT ODD, ACTUALLY... BEING IN A STRANGE CITY LIKE THIS. I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT VACATIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE A WHILE TO GET USED TO. THAT AT FIRST, YOU MIGH FEEL LONELY... HOMESICK. BUT I DON'T FEEL LONELY AT ALL. NOT THAT IT WOULD BOTHER ME THAT MUCH. I MEAN, AS AN ONLY CHILD, YOU'RE SORT OF BORN INTO FEELING THAT WAY. AND I FIGURED OU A LONG TIME AGO THAT BEING ALONE WAS EASIER IF YOU BECAME TWO PEOPLE. ONE PART OF YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME, LIKE AN AUDIENCE. AND THE OTHER PART WOULD TAKE ON DIFFERENT ROLES, KIND OF LIKE AN ACTOR. SO THAT WAY, I COULD KEEP MYSELF PRETTY AMUSED, BY WATCHING MYSELF PLAY THESE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS. BUT YESTERDAY WAS A REAL EYE-OPENER. BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME, I ALMOST COULDN'T TELL WHICH SIDE OF ME WAS TAKING ON WHICH PART. AND THAT WAS A BIT SCARY AT FIRST. BUT I'M BEGINNING TO LIKE IT. -SOME OF THESE RUGS ARE 100 YEARS OLD. -THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. YOU MUST BE PROUD TO SELL THEM. -SURE. MAYBE YOU BE PROUD TO SELL THEM, TOO. BEDROS, YOU WILL BECOME MY PARTNER. FATHER AND SON. -WELL, I'LL... I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. -SURE. SURE, YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT... NO RUSH. NO. BEDROS, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING... I INHERITED FROM MY FATHER... I HAVE SO MUCH MONEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. -IT IS FOR MY MOTHER. I SWEAR IT'S FOR MY MOTHER! -I GO TO CALL THE POLICE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO? THEY PUT YOU IN THE JAIL. -I WON'T DO IT AGAIN. PLEASE, SIR! -THEY TORTURE YOU. THEY BEAT YOU WITH STICKS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? -YES. -SURE? -YES. -PROMISE ME YOU DON'T DO AGAIN? -YES. YES. -GO. IF YOU WANT THEM TO REMEMBER, YOU SCARE. BEDROS, I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING. I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WHY? AT HOME, I HAD TWO STORES. TWO. I INHERIT FROM MY FATHER. I HAD SO MUCH MONEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. YOU KNOW HOW I HAD THAT MONEY? I BRIBE. I BRIBE POLICE, I BRIBE JUDGE... EVERYONE. IT'S THE WHOLE NEW WAY TO SURVIVE THERE. IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE. I WASN'T HAPPY. ONE DAY, I WAKE UP AND I SAW EVERYTHING TAKEN FROM ME. MY HOUSE, MY MONEY, MY STORES... EVERYTHING. THE BASTARDS MAKE ME WAI THREE YEARS TO GET OUT OF THAT HELL. THREE YEARS! I COME HERE WITH NOTHING. NO MONEY, NO HOUSE... NOTHING. SO I WORK. I WORK LIKE A DISHWASHER, TAXI DRIVER... YOU NAME IT. FINALLY, I MAKE SMALL MONEY AND I BUY THIS STORE. I KNOW, THIS IS A SMALL STORE IF I COMPARE WHAT I HAD THERE. BUT YOU THINK I AM MISERABLE? OH, NO. NO, I AM VERY HAPPY. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU START WITH NOTHING, EVERYTHING YOU EARN FILLS YOU WITH PRIDE. NO BRIBES. NO LIES. NO FEAR. OH! BEDROS, WE ARE LATE, SONYA WAITING! SONYA, WE ARE HOME! -HELLO. -I'M YOUR SISTER. -AZAH... I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE HERE. -ARE YOU STAYING IN MY OLD ROOM? -NO. NO... A HOTEL. -IT'S BETTER THAT WAY. -IT'S BETTER... IT'S BETTER... WHAT IS BETTER? I SPEAK WITH YOU! WHAT IS BETTER? WHY YOU DON'T ANSWER? LOOK, LOOK HOW SHE RESPECT ME! -THE DINNER IS ALMOST READY. -WHY YOU DON'T ANSWER TO ME?! WHY YOU DON'T ANSWER TO ME?! -GO BACK TO SLEEP, PA. -I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP. I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP! -HE ALWAYS GETS LIKE THIS. -YOU MAKE THIS MADHOUSE. -LOOK AT ME, PA. I'M PERFECTLY CALM. -I'M CALM, TOO. I'M CALM, TOO. BEDROS, WHO IS CALM? SAY WHO IS CALM. -IF YOU'D JUST LEARN TO CONTROL YOURSELF... -I AM IN CONTROL. IF YOU LISTEN TO ME... -WHY SHOULD I LISTEN TO YOU? -BECAUSE I'M YOUR FATHER! ( Armenian ) -I AM YOUR FATHER! I AM YOUR FATHER! -IT'S BEEN NICE MEETING YOU. -YOU'RE LEAVING? -WHY DON'T WE MEET TOMORROW? -OKAY. -SONYA, PLEASE, NO. -CALM, GEORGE, PLEASE. SHE WANTED TO MEET HER BROTHER. -NO. PLEASE, SONYA. Peter: ANOTHER DAY OF DISCOVERY. I WAS INVITED TO HAVE DINNER AT THE HOME OF A VERY NICE OLDER COUPLE WHO INTRODUCED ME TO THEIR DAUGHTER. THEY'RE AN UNUSUAL FAMILY. QUITE DIFFEREN FROM WHAT I'M USED TO. I'D LIKE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEM. GET TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR... WAY OF LIFE. THE WAY I SEE IT, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG IN PRETENDING... AS LONG AS YOU'RE AWARE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IT TAKES MORE EFFOR TO SPEAK WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND THAN TO SAY, ''YES, DAD.'' WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? -ALL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SINCE WE MET IS ABOUT DAD AND ME. -SO? -THERE ARE OTHER THINGS. -LIKE WHAT? -YOU AND YOUR PARENTS. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -WHAT WERE THEY LIKE? -QUITE TYPICAL, I SUPPOSE. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS. NICE HOUSE. THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THEM, REALLY. -WHAT DID THEY DO? -THE USUAL. -AND THAT MEANS? -THE USUAL THINGS THEIR TYPE OF PEOPLE DO. WHAT'S SO FUNNY? -YOU SEEM VERY PROUD OF THEM. -WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? -DO YOU LOVE THEM? -I SUPPOSE. -YOU SUPPOSE? -I DID LOVE THEM. -BUT THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -YOU'VE CAST THEM ASIDE. -I HAD TO. -WHY? -IT'S OBVIOUS. -NOT REALLY. I MEAN, IF I DISCOVERED THAT PA AND MA HAD ADOPTED ME, I WOULDN'T TRY TO FIND MY REAL PARENTS. -YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. -WHY NOT? -WELL... IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO... TO IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THAT SORT OF SITUATION. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. ALL I CAN SAY IS THA I DECIDED TO FIND YOU BECAUSE SOMETHING INSIDE ME NEEDED TO. THAT'S IT. -SO HERE YOU ARE. -YEAH. -HAPPY? -NOT REALLY. -WHY NOT? -IT UPSETS ME TO SEE YOU AND GEORGE ARGUING ALL THE TIME. -I'M AFRAID THERE ISN'T MUCH THAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT. -YES, THERE IS. I'LL MAKE THINGS BETTER. -NEVER? -I DON'T THINK SO. -THEN I MAKE YOU SOME TONIGHT. AND RABBIT. YOU LIKE RABBIT? -YES. -OH... OH, IT'S OKAY. WAS YOUR MOTHER A GOOD COOK? -MY FOSTER MOTHER. NOT AS GOOD AS YOU ARE. -AH, YOU JUST SAY THIS. -NO. I MEAN IT. -WERE YOUR PARENTS MAD WHEN THEY FIND OUT? -FIND OUT WHAT? -FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR US. -NO. THEY WEREN'T THAT... EMOTIONAL. -THEY ARE NOT LIKE US. -DEFINITELY NOT LIKE YOU. -DOES IT BOTHER YOU WHEN YOUR PAPA SCREAM'? -A LITTLE. HAVE AZAH AND HIM ALWAYS FOUGHT SO MUCH? -NO. THEY USED TO LOVE EACH OTHER. THEY JOKE, AND GEORGE TAKE AZAH WITH HIM EVERYWHERE. BUT NOW... I DON'T KNOW. -THINGS WILL GET BETTER. -DID YOU... FIGHT WITH YOUR PARENTS? -NO. BUT WE DIDN'T DO THAT MUCH ELSE. -WERE YOU HAPPY? -I'M MUCH HAPPIER HERE. -REALLY? THEN WHY YOU DON'T STAY WITH US, IN AZAH'S OLD ROOM? -I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO BECOME... TOO DEPENDENT. -OH, I SEE. -THAT WILL BE $7, PLEASE. -OKAY, I PAY. -NO, SONYA. -WHY? -IT'S A GIFT. AZAH SAID SHE'D BRING THE WINE, SO LET ME BUY THE BUNNY. ( singing ) -THIS WINE TASTE' LIKE SWEAT! -I HAVE TO LEAVE. -YOU HARDLY EAT SOMETHING. -I HAVE A CLASS AT SEVEN. -AZAH... -IT'S IMPORTANT, MA. -I MAKE SOME SANDWICH FOR YOU. -WHY? -TO TAKE WITH YOU. -IT'S OKAY, MA. -AZAH... -NO. -PLEASE, STAY. -I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. GOODBYE, PA. -BEDROS, COME WATCH TV WITH ME. -WHAT'S THE MATTER? -I CAN'T STAND THIS ANYMORE. IT IS LIKE SHE'S HIS ENEMY. -HAVE YOU TRIED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT? -WHAT USE FOR? -IT MIGHT HELP. -SOMETIMES, IT'S BETTER TO KEEP QUIET. IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU WERE HERE, BEDROS. HE MISS YOU. SOME NIGHT', HE'S NOT ABLE TO SLEEP... BECAUSE HE'S THINKING OF YOU. WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SOMETIMES EVEN, HE'S THINKING THAT YOU ARE IN HIS HOUSE, WATCHING HIM. HE WANTS SO MUCH TO HAVE HIS SON. HE NEEDS SOMEBODY TO LISTEN TO HIM. -I'M HERE NOW. -BEDROS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MISS MOST? -WHAT? -TO HOLD YOU LIKE A BABY. -YOU STILL CAN. -OH, YOU' JUST BREAK MY BONES. -NO, I WON'T. HERE. PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME. ( she's humming a IuIIaby ) ( he hums aIong with her ) -WELL, THIS IS IT. -IT'S HUGE. -I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO SHARE IT WITH. IT'S QUITE CHEAP. -REALLY? -BUT THERE IS NO HEATING. -OH. -THINK ABOUT IT. AND THIS IS MY ROOM. -AND THESE ARE YOURS? -UH-HUH. -THEY'RE GOOD. -THANK YOU. DO YOU RECOGNIZE HIM? IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS MA KEPT. YOU WERE BEST FRIENDS. -ALAS... POOR TEDDY. -YOU KNEW HIM? -QUITE WELL. -THIS IS YOU. -WOULD YOU SAY I'VE CHANGED? -A BIT TALLER MAYBE? OTHERWISE, THE SPITTING IMAGE OF PA. -IS THAT A COMPLIMENT? WHEN'S THE LAST TIME THE TWO OF YOU TALKED? -IN COUNSELLING. -IN WHAT? -WE WENT TO SEE A COUNSELLOR. -YOU'RE JOKING. -NO. -HOW DID YOU GET GEORGE TO GO? -MA CONVINCED HIM THA IT WAS FOR A CHECK-UP. -HE BELIEVED HER? -HE ALWAYS DOES. -DID IT HELP? -WHAT? -THE COUNSELLING? -WELL, OUR COUNSELLOR SEEMS TO THINK SO... ALTHOUGH THAT COULD BE HIS RATIONALE FOR GETTING BEAT UP. -BY GEORGE? -HOW DID YOU KNOW? -I GUESSED. HIS TEMPER. -OH. I SUPPOSE IT ALL CULMINATED THIS ONE DAY, WHEN HE CAME TO PICK ME UP FROM SCHOOL. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ART CLASS WHEN HE JUST WALKED INTO THE STUDIO... IMAGINE THE SHOCK. I MEAN, THERE I WAS, HIS DAUGHTER, IN FRONT OF A NAKED MAN. HE RIPPED UP EVERYONE'S DRAWINGS, AND THEN THREATENED TO KILL THE MODEL. IT WASN'T FUNNY THEN. -WHAT HAPPENED? -HE TOLD ME TO GO BACK WITH HIM. I REFUSED. -MOVED OUT? -FEW MONTHS LATER, YES. YOU'D STAY IN HERE. -HAVE YOU CONSIDERED WHA WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY? -WE TALKED ABOUT A LO OF THINGS, YESTERDAY. -ABOUT DAD AND YOU. -WHAT'S THERE TO CONSIDER? -WELL, I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT COMMENT HE MADE. -WHICH ONE? -''THIS WINE TASTE LIKE SWEAT.'' I WAS WONDERING WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU'D AGREED WITH HIM. -WHY WOULD I DO THAT? -TO APPEASE HIM. -APPEASE HIM? I WOULD HAVE FELT LIKE A LIAR. -BUT YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO. -OF COURSE I WOULD. -COULDN'T YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS AN ACTOR? -WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? -WELL... A LIAR IS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T SPEAK THE TRUTH. AN ACTOR DOES, BUT IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S VOICE. -THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. -SURE THERE IS. WHEN YOU'RE ACTING, YOU'RE DOING IT FOR SOMEONE. YOU'RE PROVIDING THEM WITH A GIFT. -I WOULD STILL FEEL TERRIBLE. -NOT IF YOU REALIZED WHY YOU WERE DOING IT. -AND WHY WOULD THAT BE? -TO SHOW YOU LOVE HIM. GEORGE! GEORGE! GEORGE, LET'S GO! GEORGE? -YES? -HOW OFTEN DO YOU COME TO THESE PLACES? -ONCE A WEEK. -ALWAYS ON THURSDAY? -YES. SOMETIMES ON TUESDAY. AND MONDAY. -DO YOU FIND THEM... AROUSING? -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -DO THEY EXCITE YOU? -WHO? -THE DANCERS. -PFT! -BUT THEN, WHY DO YOU GO? -TO RELAX. -BUT YOU DIDN'T SEEM RELAXED. -SURE I RELAXED. -THEN WHY DID YOU KEEP LOOKING OVER AT ME? -WHY DO YOU ASK THESE QUESTIONS? -I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO SEE A WOMAN LIKE THAT, ON THE STAGE... IT MUST AFFECT YOU SOMEHOW. -BEDROS, WHAT I SEE ON THE STAGE, SHE IS NOT A WOMAN. IT'S A WHORE. YOUR MOTHER, IT'S A WOMAN. -AND AZAH? -AZAH... AZAH, SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL. -WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? -BECAUSE SHE AC LIKE A SMALL BABY. -SHE'S WORKING NOW, MAKING A LIFE OF HER OWN. -SO? -WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU CAME INTO THE CLUB ONE NIGHT, AND SAW AZAH DANCING ON THE STAGE? -WHAT? WHAT' YOU SAYING? -SHE HAS THE FREEDOM TO DO WHAT SHE WANTS. YOU CAN'T EXPEC TO CONTROL HER ANYMORE. -SHE IS A WHORE? THIS WHAT YOU WANTED TO SAY? -DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD BE? -OH, NO. NO, NO... -WHY NOT? -BECAUSE... BECAUSE SHE'S A GOOD GIRL. -THEN WHY DON'T YOU TRUST HER? WHY DO YOU... KEEP... ACTING LIKE SHE'S STILL A LITTLE CHILD? -BEDROS, SHE MAKES ME ANGRY. -WHY? LOOK, GEORGE. I'M YOUR SON, RIGHT? -SURE YOU ARE MY SON. -I'LL TRY AND FOLLOW THE VALUES YOU BELIEVE IN. BUT IF I CAN'T FIT THEM INTO MY LIFE, IF I DON'T FEEL THEY'RE RIGHT, THEN I'LL HAVE TO REJECT THEM. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DON'T RESPECT YOU. MAYBE I'LL RESPECT YOU EVEN MORE FOR KEEPING THOSE VALUES IN A WORLD WHERE I CAN'T FIT THEM IN. -SHE LOVES ME. HEY, BEDROS? -YES, GEORGE, SHE DOES. I'M AFRAID I DIDN' HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECORD MY THOUGHTS YESTERDAY. BUT THINGS HAVE BEEN QUITE HECTIC. I'VE COME TO KNOW THE FAMILY VERY WELL. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO END TO THE AMOUNT OF HOSPITALITY THEY'RE WILLING TO SHOWER ON ME. I MUST FIND SOME WAY TO REPAY THEM FOR THEIR KINDNESS IN THE TWO DAYS I HAVE LEFT. I THINK ABOUT HOME SOMETIMES. THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I REALLY MISS IT... THINGS ARE MOVING AROUND ME SO FAST. IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I FEEL. FOR THE MOST PART, I'VE BEEN QUITE HAPPY. THOUGH WITH TIME, IT'S ALL BECOME... SOMEWHAT... OVERWHELMING. WHAT TIME DOES SHE USUALLY GET OFF? -FOUR. LET'S CHECK THOUGH. SOMETIMES SHE FINISHES EARLY. SO WHY WON'T YOU LET ME SEE THEM? PLEASE. -LOOK AT THE PICTURES. -OKAY. OKAY. ( Armenian ) -HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! THIEF! THIEF! HEY! THIEF! HEY! JESUS CHRIST! -APRIL FOOL'S! -HEY! GEORGIE BABY! JUST CAUGH THIS GUY OUTSIDE WITH THESE CLOTHES. THEY WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BELONG TO YOU, WOULD THEY? -GEORGE! GEORGE! WHAT'S THE MATTER? GEORGE! OH, MY GOD, GEORGE! GEORGE. -AZAH. AZAH. -GEORGE. GEORGE. -WHERE IS... WHERE IS BEDROS? -HE'S CALLING AN AMBULANCE. -WHERE IS... WHERE IS YOUR MOTHER? -SHE'S RIGHT BESIDE YOU. -AH, SONYA. SONYA. DON'T CRY, SONYA. AZAH. AZAH... TELL YOUR MOTHER TO NOT CRY. -DO NOT CRY, MOTHER. -OH, AZAH.. I LOVE YOU. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU. -SURE I DO. -YES. I CAN DIE IN PEACE. -YOU WON'T DIE, PA. -AZAH... AZAH, MAKE ME A PROMISE. -WHAT? -DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF CHEAP. EVEN YOU DON'T HAVE ONE CENT. WORK LIKE A DISHWASHER, WAITRESS... DO ANYTHING YOU WANT, BUT DON'T LOSE YOUR RESPECT. PROMISE ME, AZAH, PROMISE. -PROMISE, AZAH, PLEASE! -I PROMISE. -THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD... BEDROS. BEDROS, TAKE A PICTURE. -A PICTURE? -YES, YES, PICTURE. -NOW? -TAKE A PICTURE NOW. DON'T ASK QUESTIONS, TAKE A PICTURE. BEDROS, TAKE A PICTURE. TAKE... LOOK AT THAT. TAKE IT NOW. TAKE IT. TAKE IT. THAT'S GOOD. -DR. THOMAS CRANE. DR. THOMAS CRANE. ( Armenian ) -LET'S GO. I'M OKAY. LOOK AT ME. -WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY? -NOTHING WRONG. IT'S ALL IN HERE. HEY, WHY YOU DON'T HUG YOUR PAPA? APRIL FOOL TO YOU. ( humming ) Peter: WHEN YOU START WITH NOTHING, EVERY BIT YOU EARN FILLS YOU WITH PRIDE. IT IS YOURS. NO BRIBES. NO LIES. NO FEAR. -HELLO? HELLO! -SURPRISE!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR BEDROS HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ( Singing in Armenian ) -YOU HAVE TO BLOW THEM ALL OUT IN ONE BREATH. -BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CANDLES. -SURE THERE IS. TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. COME ON. COME ON... -WHERE? -COME ON, COME ON... -DERYAN! DERYAN & SON! SMILE. SMILE. SMILE. -I'M SMILING. -SPEECH! SPEECH! SPEECH! SPEECH!... -WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS A TOTAL SURPRISE. I'D TOTALLY FORGOTTEN THAT TODAY WAS MY BIRTHDAY. I GUESS THAT JUST SHOWS HOW EXCITING THIS WEEK HAS BEEN FOR ME. I DON'T KNOW QUITE KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS, BUT I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING VERY, VERY IMPORTAN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. AND THAT'S THAT... IN A WAY, IT'S A PITY THA YOU'RE BORN INTO A FAMILY. IF YOU'RE RAISED WITH A GROUP, YOU'RE OBLIGED TO LOVE THEM, AND THAT REALLY DENIES YOU THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING TO KNOW THEM AS PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THAT GROUP. NOW... IN A WAY, THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN NEVER REALLY LOVE YOUR FAMILY.
