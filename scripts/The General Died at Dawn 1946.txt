Why, he's the warlord of this province, and a swell guy to do business with. But why does he want to destroy his own towns? Oh, because they refuse to pay their taxes. Well, I should think those people would learn how to obey the law, rather than suffer this. Ah, these people have no nerves, no feelings. They're used to suffering. But they can't get used to paying. Excuse me, Madam. You got a match, Colonel? No, I don't smoke. Colonel. Refuse me a match, will you? But I haven't a match. And those people didn't have the pennies to pay General Yang. Think it over. He's cute. What is his name? Sam. How does he keep cool in this hot weather? Room 26. Stay there, Sam. I bring you greetings from Mr. Wu, General Pen. I'm O'Hara. Oh, Mr. O'Hara. You startled me at first. I didn't expect him to send a foreigner. Well, he thought I'd have a better chance of getting through. Mr. Wu is very wise. With his help, we will rid the province of Yang and his locusts. Riding through, I didn't see much left for Yang to plunder. The bark on trees, perhaps. And that is why he has made so many short, desperate raids the past months. His ordinary soldiers are deserting by the dozens for the lack of rice. His ammunition is so little, it is distributed chiefly among his personal guard. Dear O'Hara, this is the time we have waited for. Here is the money. Mr. Wu gave you instructions? To the "T." To which, allow me to add, I am ashamed to say, "Be careful." Not only for the love we bear you, but for the sake of that money, and the guns it will buy. I'll get through. It is of my opinion that General Yang would sacrifice half his personal guard for that belt. Which is to say, he would give his arms and legs for it. You don't advise the train from Pengwa? No. Wait for the plane in Pengwa. It will be arranged. Good. And even there, General Yang has special agents. So be careful and only by plane. Mr. O'Hara. From the time you close that door, until the time you deliver that money to Mr. Wu in Shanghai, the fate of the people of this entire province is in your hands. I'll get through. Must be a very careful job. I can do it. Why all the secrecy? 'Cause the man O'Hara is here in Pengwa. General Yang says- I know. I've done those jobs for him before, all kinds. General Yang knows he can trust me. Your shot, Judy. Your daughter has beautiful form, Mr. Perrie. Don't worry about her. I got it all straight, see, so you don't need to worry. I'm to get this O'Hara on a train, and then leave the rest to you. He's got something General Yang wants, huh? Yes. Money for an opposite side with which to buy guns. For this reason, care must be exercised. Also for the reason the General himself needs guns badly. Hmm. O'Hara by any chance a cock-eyed fellow? No. American. Staying at your hotel. I'll point him out to you later. Well, you know, it won't be easy to get a man like that on a train when he wants to go by plane. A beautiful woman does it very easy. She's high-spirited, don't worry. Wait for me, I'll be back. I'll wait. Now, Judy. Judy. Please, Judy. No. No. No! All right. I'm not luring men to their death on trains, a man I never saw. Judy. Open this for me, will you? What good are these pills? I don't know. Someone said they were good. Who? Someone. I can't remember. I've had so many doctors. This is no place for us, China. Isn't it, Pete? A man ought to die at home, a Christian death. L- I've waited months for a chance to make enough to leave. Now it's possible. Oh, please don't come back to that again. If you'll help, it's possible. Well, maybe it doesn't mean much to you. You never saw America. But if I have six months to live- You want to live it there. New York. Nyack. L- I'd get a house on the hill looking over the river. Oh, it means so much, it does. L- I want to sit there. There's boats. They go up and down the river. You can't do this to me, Judy. You're me, my kid. It's six months, then you're free. You can do what you want then, but help me now. Oh, what's the use? You've been playing me for a sucker for as many years as I'm old. Will you do it? Sure. Sure, I will. Why not? Don't feel like that, Judy. I don't feel any way at all. I... Just leave me alone, will you? Maybe someday there will be a law to abolish the blues. Something big, like an amendment to the Constitution. For all of us. O'Hara is now on the train, from the other side. Can you beat it? He's afraid. Don't blame him. Goodbye. He's on. Any cigarettes? Be careful, Judy. I'll see you tomorrow. Yang's stopping the train at 8:00. See you after then. See you tomorrow. Boo. He remembers me. Did you expect me? What are you doing hiding behind doors? I live here till tomorrow. Do you mind? I don't mind. Do you like me, Judy? I wish you hadn't come. Do you? Like you? Yes. It's comfortable. "Cozy," said the spider to the fly. Preparations? Lots of things on the ground don't like me. For instance? Well, uh... There are certain busy Lizzies who scoot around taking potshots. At you? Mmm-hmm. But the train's moving. Sure, the train's moving, and it's nighttime and we're alone. And I like the lady and she likes me. Judy, you've got me by the throat, and I'm telling you, whether it's dopey or not. Judy. Don't do that. No? You don't want to do that. That's what you say. What do you think of that, Sam? Come on. You know, Judy, uh, I'm not one of the anxious boys. You're a good guy. I can wait. Wanna hear something funny? I'm crazy for a laugh. I'm scared. Afraid. Because of me? Yes. Well, I'm a man of infinite patience. Sure. You have a whole lifetime ahead. It was only the mail. Why are you so jumpy? I told you, lots of things on the ground don't like me. Why do they make those attempts on your life? A certain honorable tootsie roll named Yang thinks he has the right to control the lives of tens of thousands of poor Chinese. How? Military dictatorship. Taxes. You put, he takes. You protest, he shoots. A heartbreaker, a strike breaker, a head breaker. Altogether a four-star rat. And what do the poor ones say? Me. That's where I come in. They're preparing underground. They need good guns and ammunition. You'll sell to them? And, naturally, your Yang doesn't care for that? You uttered a profound mouthful, lady. Why do you risk your life, O'Hara? What do you get for it? Money? Fun? Here's my life in a few lines: Ran away from an orphan asylum at 14. Sold newspapers on the street and got pretty good at ducking blows. A life of opposition, you'd call it. Then I boxed for a living, you know. Didn't like smacking other kids around, so I quit. Dock walloper for a year, road construction, then I joined an aviation outfit. A bunch of us came over here in '29 to fly planes, and some of the fellows are still flyin' planes and dropping bombs on the same people I'm working for. You ask me why I'm for oppressed people? Because I've got a background of oppression myself, and O'Haras and elephants don't forget. What's better work for an American than helping fight for democracy? Do you know? No, I don't. But do you believe all that? That's like asking do I believe I'm alive. I hope to spit, I believe it. If I believed like that in anything, I'd do a dance. Why do you look at me like that? Can't I look? Can't I kiss you? Ask my mother. Mrs. Perrie, may I kiss your daughter, huh? Thank you. What did she say? She said it's okay. Very soon, Herr General. Isn't that marvelous? They're playing hooky from a padded cell. Look at him. You're full of jokes, aren't you? Why not? I don't meet a good girl in 10 years, and you expect me to be dumb. So eat your cabbage and don't stick pins in papa. Dinner and hurry it. Quiet, Sam. Are you hungry? Not very. You're pretty delicate. Waiter. Oh, hello, O'Hara. Hello. Who's that? A Shanghai journalist. Writes on an English-speaking paper. You can buy him for a bag of salt. How you been? Fine. Chiseler. What's the time? My watch has stopped. Ten minutes to 8:00. Can I tell you something? Something I can write down in my diary? Why won't you be serious? Why? What for? The Lord made the world in six days, and on the seventh... Oh-oh. The moles are working underground. Don't go out there. Why not? You're in trouble. Am I? They're waiting. Who is? I say, do you know what it is? Cloudburst. I'm a newspaperman, General Yang. With newspapermen, me all the time gentle. Caught yourself a public enemy, huh? That's a fact. Very bad man, et cetera. Mind if I tell our readers? No, I don't mind. Also print my picture? Sure. Front page stuff. Yeah. Thank you. Nice friends you got. Don't blame me for this, young man. I'm a plain passenger on the train. Sorry what they're doing to you. Awful, but don't blame me. Good, I won't have to remember your face. Come on, Sam. Greetings. Breath purifier? Thanks. I have got a bad taste in my mouth. What's on your mind, Yang? General Yang. General Yang, Sam. Very sweet. Aw! Sad. Mr. O'Hara, you are a big bother on me. Looks pretty black for you from where I sit, Yang. Real opposition begins. The old days are through. For my money, sweetheart, you're sitting on a porcupine. Mr. Buddha. That's a fact. That's the only way they ever leave me. They do shameful thing, lose face, then kill self. Someday even they'll get wise, your fanatics, and cut you down like the rice is reaped. Huh! My guards faithful. Stay with General Yang until each one himself becomes General, and I biggest General of all 12 provinces. Yang Incorporated, merchants of war with 12 dummy partners, huh? I don't like you to interfere. Why you help my enemy, hmm? I'd do anything I could to give you a kick in the pants. To my jaundiced eye, you're a social disease. I don't like your disposition, I don't like your friends, I don't like your politics, and I don't like your hat. Your faithful dozen may stick to you, but you're still a small noise at the end of a parade. Mr. O'Hara seems so little interested in his life. You'd take chances, too. I have a great destiny. So have I, but mine is tied up with millions of people. Yours is tied up with yourself, and the power of machine guns. Your belief is in your own very limited self. Mine is in people. One day, they will all walk on earth, straight, proud. Men, not animals, with no fear of hunger or poverty. That's not so bad to die for, sweetheart. The time has come when even, even peasants dare to laugh in the face of officer and General. Pal, my nose bleeds for you. Give me the money. Couldn't Wong find it? He's saying no money in your place. Cough up, Sam. Give me the money. The eight characters of destiny are against you. No money tonight. Eight characters say you are a liar. Come and get it. Fight? Give me. All right. This is the money. You don't have to worry an iota. I'll take it right to him. Uh, Brighton. That's his name? Yes, Brighton. He is waiting at the Mansion House, Shanghai. And B- R-l-G-H-T-O-N. Now I got it all in my head, every word of it. No mistake? Oh! General Yang never forgets mistakes. Say, am I honest or am I not? After all, I... I keep Mr. O'Hara for now. Maybe his Shanghai friends make trouble, et cetera, maybe. You're a running dog. Thanks. Very good man. Teaches my men discipline and how to make war. We will float down the river to Shanghai together, me and O'Hara. Pick up ammunition also together. Two days from now, we arrive. If Mr. O'Hara's friends make trouble, if I don't get ammunition, Mr. O'Hara don't arrive. No hummingbird can fight 15 wolves, Mr. O'Hara. Now, was that so terrible as you thought? The Mansion House. Mr. Brighton. Mr. Brighton. Paging Mr. Brighton. Paging Mr. Brighton. Paging Mr. Brighton. Paging Mr. Brighton. Paging Mr. Brighton. "I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you" "I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you" Paging Mr. Brighton. Paging Mr. Brighton. Paging Mr. Brighton. I'm Mr. Brighton. Thank you. No news? No. I am very worried. Something is very wrong. Drink hearty, my friend. Oh, no, you don't. You can't get away with that. I won't even drink this drink. You're trying to get me drunk, so I'll wait here for your man O'Hara. But I won't. Now, look here, Woozy. Don't you know I can't lay around this harbor with that load of guns? Any minute, the gitchie-witchies are liable to hop on us and we're sunk. What do you think I'm doin'? Waitin' till the kids get out of school to sell them lollipops and pretzels? No, it's munitions. It's illegal. Plenty guns. Plenty bullets. Plenty noise. And you, none of your philosophical remarks. Get me, Chennie? Is he comin' or not? No philosophy. Have a drink, my friend. Oh! Take the wax out of your ears. Don't you hear me? You can't get me tight. Mr. Brighton, it is no such intention in my mind. But we are expecting an information from Mr. O'Hara this morning. What was in that wire you got? Oh! Smart, very smart. Well, you get six more hours and then I sell to the first comer. That's what was in that wire. Get me? Got you. You forget the glass. Oh. I'll be under that moose head and a stuffier piece of stuffin' I've never seen. "I'll be glad when you're dead" "You rascal you" "I'll be glad when you're dead" "you rascal you" Detestable man. Who is it? Don't know. Thank you. Pete. What? Where are you going? I'll be back. Where are you going? Down to the bar... for a tonic. No more bets on the ponies? Now, Judy, have I got money for bets? I don't know. Have you? I surely don't understand your attitude. Pick up that shipment for Yang, first thing. Of course. Of course. Of course. Why, of course. Well, I must say, what a funny world where a man's own daughter don't trust him. I must say. No one mistrusts you, Pete, but I just happen to be worried about that O'Hara boy. So please be careful. Sure. Oh, you dog. Oh, you dog, you. What are you looking at, banjo eyes? He drink for three days now. Who is he? Name Mr. Brighton. Oh! Mr. Brighton? Yeah. Waiting for somebody. He got plenty money. Say he go to hard-knock university. Every morning, he eats two double lamb chops. Also has two sisters live in Washington, D.C. His favorite song: "I'll be glad when you die, you rascal you" "I'll be glad" "When you're dead, you rascal you" See? I found this sign on the floor, Mademoiselle. Thank you. My foot. I am Wu, Mademoiselle. And? I bring to Mademoiselle the greetings of the house. A custom here. Good brandy? Yes. Our four-star is better. Brandied duck is with us a house specialty. I never eat brandied duck. Very friendly on the stomach. Like our small creature here. You have him long? Two years. Call him. What? Mademoiselle, call the animal to you. What for? Call him. Maybe if you call him with name. Maybe if you say to him, "Sam." What do you want? Where is O'Hara? Who is O'Hara? Mademoiselle, you are indelicate. You do not know him, nor the creature here? Your Mr. O'Hara was taken off a train last night. General Yang do it? Yes. What else? I don't know what else. What do you mean? You don't know more? No. The animal was left behind. You're sure nothing more? Please. Why should I lie? Mademoiselle has already lied once. Who in the world are you to demand the truth? A great friend of O'Hara. And what's that got to do with me? Shanghai is filled with dangerous persons, Mademoiselle. Be careful. Of what? Do you- You will be watched. You like to fish? It bores me. Why are you so very much interested in my country, my, uh, people? How many times before you buy guns for people of my province? Maybe I fix you so you really don't talk. Interesting idea, no? Yang, that money was the bitterly earned personal property of 500,000 oppressed people who want your heel off their collective neck. They trusted me with it, and I failed. If I live to ever look them in the face, it will be with far greater difficulty than facing you. Do I make myself clear? No. I'm saying, bring on your fires and your devils. You've already done all you can to me, or I've done it myself. Mr. O'Hara has so little regard for his life. He sounds, sounds almost like Chinese. That makes me a candidate for your guard, don't it? No. You are too much interested in women. That's a fact. You eat fresh fish tonight. Thanks. When we arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, maybe fresh fish eat you. Hmm, thanks. When does she sail? Midnight tomorrow. I'd like to book two bedrooms and a sitting room. Two bedrooms and- It's for me and my daughter. Oh, yes, Mr... Uh, Martin. Martin. Mr. Martin. Peter Martin. Peter Martin. I'll pay you now, cash. How much is it? $530. $530. $1,060. $1,060. Was the name Martin, did you say? Yes, Martin, Peter Martin. Midnight tomorrow, Mr. Martin. Seems everybody in these parts have two names. Have they? That one is either a thief or a liar. Really? He gave a fake name. I've seen it by the initials on his wallet. How are you on pears? 24 hours more, and still no news. I shall lose my mind waiting. The boy must be dead. Has the girl made any moves? In 24 hours, nothing suspicious. "I'll be glad" "When you're dead, you rascal you" "I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you" Believe me, Mr. Chen, it's lucky if more complications do not set in. Oh, where are you coming from? Down the bar, having a drink. Down the bar? Why? What's the matter? Headache. Oh. You've been looking awfully worried these last 24 hours. Well, knock on wood, huh. Everything's shipshape. We'll be out of here by midnight. We're on our way, huh? What's that for? Shh. Who's that? I don't know. A fat man. How did he get here? He sneaked in, looked through your bags. Better open up, brother. Who are you? I was inside when he came. He didn't see me. I can make an awful racket, maybe break down the door. You wouldn't like that disturbance, would you? Better call the police, Pete. No, no! Open up. Judy, don't get excited. Judy? What's the matter? Nothing, nothing. We don't know who he is and- Where's your gun? In my bag. Stand back. Come out of there. Put down your popgun. Who are you? I'm the angle man. W- what? When you're in trouble, I work out the angles. We'll find an angle, Brother Perrie, and, uh, Miss Perrie, I might add. And what's all that supposed to mean? Well, from the General to the specific, you're on a very interesting project. No one here knows what you're talking about. Now you get out. We'll have the police on you in 10 seconds. Get out. Now, I'm not the smartest man in the world, brother, but I'm not the dumbest. You send for the police. Yes, you do that little thing. Well, what are you gonna do? Judy, this man's a big imposter of some sort, a- a faker... He's gonna share some money with me. What money? That's what I came to find out. Oh, come on, get out of here. You admit you don't know what you're talking about. But your father, he knows. Just look at him. He needs a friend. A bird's-eye-view man like me that knows the town, all the back alleys. Get out! You have it in your power to stop me from leaving, Brother Perrie. Pete? One final word, Brother Perrie. If you were thinking of escaping with a large sum of money, and you know you are, it'd be absolutely fatal not to insure yourself with a man like me. Oh, excuse me, I forgot to introduce myself. The name is Leach. And I want one-third of it. I shall be downstairs in the bar. And I shan't consider it an imposition if you should call on me when you need me. Judy- I don't want one trembling word out of you, not one. All I want to know is what you're doing with those Yang funds? Shh. Don't duck, Pete, answer my question. You can't frighten me. I won't give it up. Not a cent. You'll have to. I'm not gonna let the O'Hara boy get killed. I don't care if he does. Here are the tickets. We're going to the States. You mean you are. I'll get there. In a coffin. Judy, help me, please. Not this year. Judy, don't you see, it's for you. I can't use all this money- Oh, stop that. Think about buying what you want- Are you picking up that shipment or not? Are you? No. What are you going to do? Get out of my way. You won't tell anyone? Won't I? No. Because that would be patricide. Killing your own father. You couldn't do it, Judy. But you're murdering O'Hara. You can do that. It doesn't mean the slightest, dumbest thing to you that I haven't slept for two nights because of him. Oh, it's nice to talk about "patricide" and "poor father," but that I'm crazy about the boy doesn't make you wink an eye. Do you care about him or me? Do you care about me a nickel's worth? Where are you going? I don't know. Will you tell him? I might. You wouldn't dare. Maybe you're wrong. Or right. If I were the heroine of a novel, I'd know what to do. Pull a plane out of one sleeve, a fat checkbook out of the other, get the Marines, and put the situation well in hand. But this is a simple girl, my lovey-dovey Pete, one of the nameless legion that always gets stuck. Yes, your black-hearted daughter is up a dead-end street. Useless, dumb. But if you laugh at him or me, I'll I'll have your life. Take it with my own hands. The General say you go. Do you want to die? Show me how to get out of here. Ah. Mademoiselle plays a very nice game. May I join you, Mademoiselle? Certainly. Come along. I regret, Mademoiselle. Really, really? What is it? I feel like a bag of broken glass. Chen. It's not serious. I will do it myself. Get some hot water, some iodine, some bandages. His clothes are in my rooms. Well, you may as well start from the beginning. What happened? And that's the story in a nutshell. I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara, for everyone. We can never trust you again. I don't expect it. You were lonely, huh? Yeah, if you want to put it that way. In our cause, my friend, there must be a minimum of loneliness and a maximum of care. Well, what next? Next is to find the girl. I'll find her and give her the works. What is the good, to give the works? She knows who Yang's agent is. Mmm-hmm. Well. I'll grab her and make her cough up. We'll have to work fast. Yang won't waste a minute now he's here. One thing is in our favor. Yang's agent has not yet contacted Mr. Brighton. No? No. He has private plans, it seems. No, he... It's that dame. Huh? Well, maybe you're right. There was some guy, some little guy. Shanghai's a big town. I don't know where to start looking for her or him. I suppose you'll kill her if you see her or him. In half. Huh. Mr. Chen? I think maybe we will soon have that money again. Hey. What are you trying to pull? O'Hara's here. Calm yourself, calm yourself, my friend. I think maybe we soon fix everything. Lay down, Sam. I know it's not my right to say it, but I'm glad you're alive. Save your breath because anything you say goes in one ear and out the other. What are you going to do? You make the recommendation, you're so talented. You started to beat me up. You might continue where you left off. I might kill you, that's a possibility. Yes, it is. First, I want some information. Answer precisely and to the point. Who employed you? Yang? Yes. When they took the belt off me, they gave it to a man. Who was he? L- I don't know. A little fellow with a gray face, sick-looking. I don't know. Don't waste my time, I'm warning you. I'll tell you whatever I can. And don't give me that whiskbroom stuff. Brushing me off. Is it necessary to shout? Where's the dough? Listen, lady, you can be broken in little pieces. Little pieces, very easy. What's funny? You think I care, but I don't. That's what's so funny, Mr. O'Hara. I could kill myself for almost next to nothing. Try carbon monoxide. They say it's pretty good. O'Hara, O'Hara, you're such a fool. Sit down. And this is the girl I loved with vitamins A, B, and C. Why are you so hard like that? Where's the money? I wouldn't tell you if I knew. You can't intimidate me. This is Shanghai, a public hotel. You were doing illegal work, running guns. You fell. You were so busy giving me a rah-rah talk, you couldn't see before your nose. You want to speak to me, speak as a person or not at all. Not at all is good enough for me. There's no money here. I didn't ask you. The pig they made this out of was luckier than you're gonna be before I get through. You gotta listen to me. I want the cash. I had nothing to do with it. You didn't get me on the train? Against my will. Let me explain. I know. You're working a brother through school. Please, if- Or an old, sick father needs care. Let me tell you, dreamboat, don't think I fell for you. A tree with a flower on. I'd have fallen for that, the way I felt. A fish on a dish would have gotten me. You don't have to justify yourself. You think you're pretty smart, don't you? I'm sorry you won't listen. You're licked. The money isn't here, Mr. O'Hara. Your gun won't help, and your brawn won't help. And your big mouth won't help. When I'm finished here, we'll talk about places where it might be. Unless Yang gets here before we're clear. He's at anchor, three miles out, personally. He is? I speak good English. O'Hara, the money isn't there. Where is it? Is Yang here? Where do you suppose I came from, the sky? Are you being tricky? You heard Yang say he'd pick up the shipment himself. Suppose you got that money, most of it, what would you do? Would you let the person go who had the money? Maybe. And give him a bonus? This is no bargain counter. It is for you. I'd have to ask. Who? Wu. Then do it. A $1,000 or $2,000 bonus. You mean it? I mean it. Who's in there? Where? Behind that door. I don't know. But if I were behind it, I'd keep it locked. Don't you come in here. Pete! Stay out, now. Wait! Stay out, I tell you! Who is he? My father. He's dead. Get your hand fixed. I'm sorry. He's Yang's agent. I'll have to get my belt. You'll get your money. I'll get it now. Get out. Please get out. I'm sorry. What must I do to ask you to leave me alone with this tired old man? Do you want me to call the police? No, even if you could. Do you want me to scream and be heard? I must get my belt. Try your room. I'm not sorry for him. He took a job. He knew what it involved. I'm sorry you had to get into this mess. I said it before. You can't do this kind of work and die in bed. It was my life or his. It's got me nuts, too. I like people too much to shoot, but it's a dark year and a hard night. Come on. I'll have to take whatever he's carrying. Don't make me go in that room. All right. You stay here and have your sorrow out alone. Hello. Looks like you, uh, murdered a man, brother. Miss Perrie, take his gun from him. Miss Perrie, take his gun. All right. Now throw it on the bed. That's right. Now, may I recommend care, Mr. O'Hara? Look before you leap. And you, too, Miss Perrie. I may be fat, but I'm agile. Now may I recommend our next move? Evidently, you may. Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut. The money isn't on our dear dead brother. Now, every impulse of my carnal nature says to stay here and continue the search. But every impulse of my intellectual nature says to move the luggage and all out of the approaching Yang's wrath. Am I, uh, understood? Well, do it. Oh, no, no, no. You do it. Mr. Wu. Call him. Hello. Ask Mr. Wu to come up. Take a seat. And you, too. Not so good. Better luck next time. Don't try it again. Now, sit down where you were. Don't move. Fatso was sucking around for a little nectar. No time to waste. Did you find anything? The girl knows where it is. Who is he? Her father. You kill him? Yeah. Watch him. Bring the body here. Fats will help. Now, you stay here with Miss Perrie. And you come with me, my freelance friend. But perfect, positive quiet. You hear me, Fats? I hear. I will come back. I was holding the fort, General, but they nailed me down. Yes? Who are you? I heard they was going to rob you, so l- Very nice. Find Mr. Brighton. Bring him here. Gentle. O'Hara! He's got another one there. Where is Mr. Perrie? Miss Perrie, where is Mr. Perrie? Dead. Killed. In there. Man who killed Perrie, take money. Give me. Don't talk? Nobody? I leave my men here to search, and we, all good friends, go on my boat. Maybe then somebody talk what this is all about. Take baggage, too. It looks like I'm the original boy that took the watch apart and couldn't put it together again. He don't shake hands no more. Example of what sometimes happens. My man Wong here, uh, uh... Expert. Yes. Very expert. Can make painfulness many, many ways. See? Big chop, little chop. And person die very slow. Your friend Mr. Chen die too fast. So you don't forget? Hmm? Now, which dog hide bone? Miss Perrie, perhaps. Now you tell me where is the hiding place? I don't know, General Yang. That's the plain honest truth. My man Wong, expert. Expert. She told you 50 times, she don't- Shh. Shush your Aunt Susie. The water around here is jammed with gunboats. And you'll have one on your tail any minute. Optimist. Yes. Optimist, O'Hara. Got fog. Got night. But there will be a day. Oh, plenty day, but you'll never see it. You, you, and you, you all die because destiny don't fail me. I looted 12 cities, killed many thousands, make great commerce: Silk, rice, and opium. Got big, great friends. I am Yang. Would somebody please be good enough to hide Mr. Chen's face? Let's put him up there. Well? Do you want me to tell Yang, or will you? Tell him what? Where the money is. Do you know? Lady, this is no time for games. But I don't know and that's the blank, flat, honest truth. Didn't you tell me in your room at the hotel you'd make a deal? Didn't you tell me that... You certainly knew where it was then. I thought my father had it on him. That's the truth? That's the truth, and may I be permitted to exercise the prerogative of the outsider? Now, may l- May I make a suggestion before he wakes up? Sure, but if you're gonna suggest chocolate, I prefer vanilla. This is how I see it. A girl is good for nothing, and she knows it. The only bright spot in her life she can remember is when she once won a prize in school. That's all right because it only involves the girl's life. But then she begins to get good people in trouble, perfect strangers, like you're in trouble now, and Mr. Wu. It sounds like the speech that got you that prize. Well, I don't care. Even if I got off this boat, I don't know where I'd go or what I'd do. I've got a good, solid chunk of anguish in me as it is. Why don't I tell Yang I know where the money is and that I'll tell if he lets you off the boat, and Mr. Wu. You would do that? Why not? It won't cost me anything, as the saying goes. Except your delicate little life. Who's that a loss to? Me, myself, and I? Don't be a fool. Don't you be a fool. Let her do it, O'Hara. Do you want this girl to kill herself? She got us here, didn't she? You think Yang will fall for that stuff? He might. Otherwise, it's finished. I'll call him. O'Hara! This young lady is about to present a lie to Your Excellency. She's going to tell you she knows where the money is and reveal its hiding place if you will release her comrades. You make decide? Yes, and it's no lie. But you'll have to release Mr. Wu and O'Hara before I tell you. I don't care what you do with him. You make bargain? Yes. I don't take a chance. If Miss Perrie knows, we'll find out quick. We'll take Miss Perrie deeper in the ship. Oh, Mr. O'Hara like her. Very sad. Too bad he never kiss her. Yes. Too bad. Maybe now make kissing before Miss Perrie go because maybe he don't like her when she comes back. Can I tell you something? Sure. Maybe we're through here and because we're through, I want to ask you something. Ask or tell? Ask first, then tell. Why did you pick me up in Pengwa? You needed the dough? My father, he wanted to get out of the country. Honest? Yes. I would have helped you before now, if I could. Why? Look, Judy, life at its best isn't much of a bargain. Someday it may be different, not now. It's a series of dumb accidents. Now you're a great guy, you scratch your finger, blood poisoning. What are you trying to say? Look, you kicked out one of my lungs on the train. You were properly sore. All over. I don't feel like that now. I'm trying to say you're wonderful. That makes me a sap, I know, but it doesn't make any difference one way or the other now. You know I'm wonderful, too. You are. Judy Perrie, darling, we could have made wonderful music together. We could have worked and made ourselves a circle of light and warmth. O'Hara, I am so lonely for you. Hey. Where's my whisky, Rastus? Oh, dummies, huh? Oh, I see. I asked you for a drink, and that's your answer. Tough guy, huh? Make me a prisoner, will you? Ah! Go away. What are you doing? Yeah, put that tomahawk away. Where's my whisky? The Herr General sends his regrets, we have no whisky aboard. Ah, what kind of house is this? Ain't got nothing to drink. There must be whisky in those bags. Hey, what goes on here, Sambo? What is this? What did you say? Do you see this? Well, now you don't. What's in these? When I want something, I want it when I want it. Well, that's fine. Why didn't I think of that before? Well, well, well. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Sit down. That's American money, and no Chinese can- Sit down, please. All right, I heard you, I heard you. All right. There's more here in the bag. Get out of my way. So the drunk fool found the bone. Everybody please come outside on deck. What's happened? General Yang wishes to converse with you. He's got our telephone number. Do so immediately! He's stabbed. If he isn't dead in 20 minutes, it will be a miracle. He's our only chance. Yang? This is something I never expected to see. Who chopped you? Miss Perrie knows all the time where money is. We found it in her father's bag. He hide good. Now, I must kill all of you. But the General promised if he found the money, we should go free. Huh. Am I free? Slowly here, my life fall out, fall out in my hand. You make me so much trouble, you die one by one. Yang, I asked you who chopped you up, and you didn't answer me. Don't argue with him, Wu, because he's sore at the world, and who blames him? It's easy to see that his own guards betrayed him, knifed him. Huh! What a laugh that will be. Boys and girls will dance in the streets when they hear how the great Yang was killed by his own men. Lie, lie. You hear me? Lie! Drunk fool Brighton make accident. Tell it to Sweeney. Even if it were true, where was your guard when it happened? Where were your tootsie boys who were supposed to give up their lives for you? My men are faithful. How do you know? My men die for me, okay. They're alive and kicking, while your singing days are over. When you die here, they'll feed you to the sharks. Then they'll go where another General will give them rice and put silver in their pockets. They will not return. What's to stop them? They will be dead. Who will kill them? They lose face. They shoot each other. At whose command? My command. You must think we're out of a nuthouse to believe a story like that. They have sons and wives. You see answer. Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, he understand Chinese. "Men, do not forget this happening," he says. "In the temples of Peiping "and in the sing-song houses of Canton they will laugh at Yang and his guards", he says. "Only if they are not afraid "to ascend to the Dragon with him, can they hope to wipe out this shame", he says. They are agreeing to die with him. My men faithful. That's the most marvelous thing I ever saw in my life. Excellency, you are to be commended upon the integrity of your guard. But, uh, might I make a little suggestion? What about giving the order for my release? White flesh dies. Also Mr. Wu. One by one. Oh yes, yes, I know, I know. And very just, too. They deserve it. But what about me? You know, just me? Thank you, Excellency. Thank you. I'm very sorry, but you understand. You know, self-preservation. Go. But, Excellency, you misconstrue me. Go. Excellency, you misconstrue me. Excellency! Excellency. Shut up. General Yang, I'm thinking of you. Yes. You're a brave, great man, and so are your guards, but who will know it if they die with you? Who's left to tell the story? Excellency, let me go, let me go! Yang, what will your enemies say? They'll say river pirates assaulted you, or Nanking surprised you in the night. Your enemies will never know the glorious death that was yours and your men's. What did he say, O'Hara? What did he say? Yang, listen to me. Such great honor should not live in a closet. It needs the open air and daylight. Your enemies must not laugh at the memory of General Yang. Coolies must not laugh. Peasants, old men, women must not spit on your name. You can't do this to me. I won't die. Someone must be left, Yang. Someone who has seen this last, glorious page in the history of General Yang's life. Yang, listen to me, before you fall asleep. Yang, before you fall asleep. O'Hara, O'Hara! They'll find out the truth. How? If you stop all our mouths, who will be left to speak tenderly of Yang? No one, I tell you, no one! O'Hara! You'll tell the story, O'Hara? Yes, I will tell it. Yes. Of your greatness and the obedience of your men. Gentlemen in clubs will hear it. Crowds at the dog races will talk of your guards. Shanghai diplomats will know it. Gunboat captains will tell it by radio. O'Hara, O'Hara! Every great paper in the world must tell how Yang's guard went to death with him. The London Times, The New York Times. You think we'll get pictures in the papers? Everywhere. Because these are not things that happen every day. You want I let you go? Let us go. Us? All of us, to see no stain or blemish is left on the memory of Yang. Will it be worth it? Don't lie? I swear, this is one true thing. That's a fact? Yes. Yang, before you fall asleep. Yes, yes, help, help. Oxford. You will see. I am a big man. He was a talented man, but very, very corrupt.
