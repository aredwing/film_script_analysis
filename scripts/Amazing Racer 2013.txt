I'm Dr. Baker. You can call me Rita. Technically, Shannon, you had an accident. However, there's concern there was intent behind it, so we're hoping you'll let us find out. You lost your dad, sweetheart. That's got to hurt, probably more than you know, and they're gonna want to make sure you've begun the process of healing before they let you leave. Before they let me leave? Mm-hmm. They don't know anything. [Laughs] Since I'm one of the "they," I'd have to disagree with you. But I do agree that I don't know you, so the sooner you let me work with you, the sooner you can get out of here. [Door closes] I can't believe she didn't come. Funerals aren't really Emily's thing, okay? You know, she... Let's just leave it at that. You're gonna have to give her a little bit more time and remember that she never had her own children. She never wanted kids. Exactly. If you're not hungry, Shannon, just say so. You don't have to pretend to eat it or even like it, but you will most certainly not play with it. See? Yeah. This is my house, my rules. Got it, honey lamb? [Crying] Emily: My house, my rules. [Screams] [Horn blares] [Door opens] Dave, Emily, right? Right. Welcome. You can call me Rita. So... I'm curious to know if Shannon said anything to you about her mother. That she died in childbirth and her father raised her on his own. Well, that ain't really what happened. What did happen? Jeff met Christine senior year. They fell in love. Unfortunately she got pregnant. Christine's parents, they didn't like the idea that she was gonna have a kid, and, uh, Jeff and his mother, I guess they decided would take little Shannon and, uh, disappear with her, tell the other family that the baby was dead. Mother and family think that the baby's dead, and Shannon thinks her mother's dead. And it's gotta be made right. Jeff never did it, but he asked me to do it. He said if anything ever happened to him... That I should go and, uh... And I should tell Shannon the truth and tell her what happened and tell her that her mom was still alive. Are you sure you want to do this now? Yeah. I'm gonna tell her. And would the two of you continue raising Shannon? Well, I could. No, no, no, no, we couldn't. No, we couldn't. I see. I'm so sorry. It's all right. Shannon, Dave has something to tell you. Do I get to leave the hospital? [Laughs] Listen... Your father loved you very, very much. I hope you know that. Yeah, of course. And everything he ever did, he felt he was doing for the right reason, even though it might not have seemed like it. What's going on? Your mom, your mother's still alive. Huh? Your mother's still alive. What is this? Dave's gonna answer all your questions, okay? I'm here to help with the rest. Did my daddy know? Yeah. He's been waiting for you. Oh, hello, handsome. [Sighs] You're such a sweetie. Let's take a look. You're not ready to go home just yet. Mm, how much longer, Dr. Pearson? He's not eating the way I want, but with that will of his, let's say another 48 to 72 hours. But that's just a guess. Of course. [Pager beeping] I have Dr. Pearson returning Dr. Baker's call. Dr. Baker, what can I do for you? I'm the staff psychiatrist at South Florida medical center. Did you know a man named Jeff Greene? Why? He died piloting a small plane. I'm sorry. Um, I appreciate that. Uh, I haven't seen him in over 16 years, so I am not sure exactly why you're calling me. He left behind a daughter, yours. That's not funny. No, it's not. Your daughter needs you. She's in a bad way. Dr. Pearson? I'm sorry, but I'm gonna to have to call you back. You okay, Dr. Pearson? Yeah. You know they make TV movies about this kind of stuff, right? [Chuckles] Ah. You know, things happen, babe, and we move on. Both of you were lied to, not just you, and now you get to heal together. I'm not sure I know how to do that. None of us do until we do it. Okay? No, no, no. Don't cry. [Laughs] Ah, sweetie. Hi, Shannon. I'm... I'm... I'm Christine. I'm gonna miss you a little bit, kiddo. [Crying] Everything's gonna be fine. It's gonna be okay. Don't you worry. [Crying] You don't know. You gotta trust me. I promise. It's gonna be all right. You're right. Nobody here knows what's going to happen. I mean, we only just heard about each other a few days ago. Oh, God. Look, just because I'm your mother, it doesn't mean that you're gonna have to make this permanent. You have a life here, and my life is there... So... What I suggest is let's give it the summer. You hate it, you come back. Keep in touch, don't keep in touch, up to you. But let's give it the summer. Yeah? Deal? Deal. [Plane engine roaring] How's the barn doing? Well, we picked up another filly, but, um... What's wrong? She's got a knee problem, and, uh, looks like it's a little worse than I thought. Eric trains racehorses. He has the most beautiful farm. I was thinking maybe after dinner we could go take a ride if you like. I'm not hungry, and I hate horses. What was that? I'm not hungry. No, after that. I hate horses. Oh. I thought you said that you and your father did everything together. Yeah. Okay. What? Do you honestly expect me to believe that your father never passed on his passion for horses to you? Leave me alone. You've got him wrapped around your finger, don't you? We're here. You two call a truce yet? You know, uh, it's a lot for both of you. I know. Okay. You don't have to do this all alone. I know. Just leave them there, and we'll take 'em in. Shannon, nice to meet you. I'll see you tomorrow, all right? Could you please help get that other bag? Please? Okay. Look, I didn't know about you either until a few days ago, okay, so this is hard on both of us. Hard on you? Tell me. Did you just lose your father and discover your mother, who you thought was dead, is really alive and well and living in Pittsburgh with some cowboy? No. No, I found out that the daughter I was told was dead and who I mourned for the last 16 years is alive, and the man who lied about it to me was the man I always thought was perfect. Bedrooms are upstairs. I'm on the right. You're on the left. If you need anything, just ask. [Jumpby alli gillie playing on music player] Christine: Shannon! Shannon. Yeah? Um, I'm going to the stables. Do you want to come with me? No, that's okay. Thank you, though. Y-you're not gonna have to ride any horses or anything, I promise. No, thanks. Um, c-could I just come in for a second? Okay. Um... Look, I know that you really don't want to, uh, hang out around hay or horses, um, but it's Eric's farm, and I was thinking, well, if nothing else, you could get a better feel for where we live and, uh, see what a real cowboy Eric is. It's not you. It's... it's me. I just... I don't want to be around horses. Fair enough. Um, look, here's the thing. Um, I have to give my horse some exercise, and then Eric's taking us out to lunch. I'm not gonna have time to do that and come back and get you, so if, uh... If you came, you could just hang out in the office, and, um, I promise I won't be long. I'm not dressed or anything. I haven't even taken a shower. I'll wait. [Neighs] Hey, Brandon. Hey, Christine. How is it? How is it? Good. Hey, Rio. Shannon, this is Brandon, Rio. They're Eric's nephew and niece. How you doing? I'm gonna go say hi to Eric before we ride. Is he in there? Yeah. He's, uh... He's working on a new filly in stall 14. She's young, but he thinks she's got a lot of potential. Okay. And who are you? She's my daughter. See you at beloved's stall in 10? Yep. Cool. No way. Yes way. No way. She's such a good girl, too. Eric: Ah. Is this the one you were telling me about? Yeah, this is her. Just trying to figure out if this is the end of the rope for this girl or just a setback. She's a beauty. Yeah, I know. Don't you think, Shannon? What's her name? Uh, well... She doesn't have a name yet. You got any ideas? Are we going to lunch or what? Yeah. Sure. I'm just gonna finish up here. Chris, are you gonna take that ride still? Uh, yeah. Yeah, Brandon's probably waiting. Do you want to come and watch? We're just gonna do some racing on the track. Nah, that's okay. You know, Shannon, if you like, my office is open. Just go down there, help yourself. Doc'll be here in about an hour. Hey, just want to see how you're doing. Fine. You know, everything is gonna be all right, right? You're gonna find a way. You always do. That's who you are. Yep. Well, we'll see. See you in half an hour? Half an hour, back at the office. Hey there, girl. Hi. Just gonna feel that leg, okay? Yeah. Wow. It looks like they did a good job on that bandage. You're in good hands, okay? Yeah, no worries, little girl. No worries. [Laughs] Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh you should try it. You ride horses, right? What makes you think that? Just a guess. And how much is that? Come on in. Sorry. I'll just be a minute. Mm-hmm. Uh, you want something to drink? Iced tea, soda, something? Uh, do you have any green tea, the real stuff? You're just like your mother. Bottom shelf. Mm-hmm. Don't wait for me to get it for you. You're family now. It's okay. Yeah, listen. Listen, I don't want you bringing over a truck full of hay if I don't like the grass. I'll check it out first. Works for me. Mm-hmm. Great. Jeez. What? You want a job here? Couple days a week, work with the horses, help me out in the office. I used to have an assistant here, but she went off to Europe to go ride with some dude. Well, I don't know how to do office stuff or answering telephones or any of that. Do you use a phone? Yeah. And you've used a pencil or a pen of some sort, I presume? Yeah. Well, then, you know. And you could ride the horses whenever you want, so long as you take care of 'em. But I don't want to ride the horses. I don't want to be here. I miss Dave. He was like my daddy's older brother. He's the only family I know. But, Shannon, you are here, so let it work for you, you know? Find peace in what you know. How do you know I know this? Whatever you say, but I need help here. You could get lost in your work. It's a win-win for both of us. Hmm? What do you say? So here's your schedule for Monday to Friday, but actually it's Sunday to Sunday, because we don't get any weekends around here. Hey. What's the haps? Well, uh, Shannon here's thinking about helping us out around here for the summer if it's okay with mom. Sure. Great. All right. Monday. Hay delivery. [Pager beeping] Get that in the morning. Also there's other deliveries all the time. I have to use the phone. Anytime something gets delivered here, they need a signature. Hi. This is Dr. Pearson. I'll be right there. It's Andrew. I have to go. Uh, are you gonna be okay? Yeah, sure. We'll catch up with you later. It's gonna be all right. Christine: Yeah. Man, it's gotta suck. Yeah. I don't get it. What's up? Well, your mother, she works with a lot of preemies at the hospital, and this one boy, Andrew, he, uh... He was born three months early to a user mother. He's a tough little kid. He's a real fighter, but sometimes he gets kicked back a little bit, so... Anyway, uh, who's hungry? Do you think if he'd survived, his mother would have kept him? She can hardly take care of herself. Doesn't mean that she didn't want to try, does it? No. Eric: My family's been in horse racing for about three generations now. Grandpa says longer. It gets longer every time you ask him. What is harness racing, exactly? It's like high-adrenaline off-road go-kart racing, you know, but you're strapped to a horse. Eric Parker. What a nice surprise. Mitchell. Hi, Jessica. Hi, Eric. How are you? You remember my nephew Brandon, and this is Christine's daughter, Shannon. Christine's daughter. Really? I thought I saw your mother's beauty behind those eyes. Shannon. It's good to see you again, Eric. How's Max? You tell me. Shannon, I hope our paths cross again soon. Who was that, and who's Max? That right there is pretty much the biggest... Mitchell Prescott. He's... He's just another harness racing owner. Anyway, Shannon, you ever consider racing yourself, getting behind a horse? Want to give it a try? How 'bout you tell me who Max is first? Okay. Uh, Max was a great trainer, best I've ever known. Was? Well, yeah. H-he doesn't do it anymore, but what he knows about horses could fill a library. I mean, this guy, he'd always look at the horse that no one else would pay any mind to, and, sure enough, he just knew. I'll be by later this afternoon. All right. Bye. Uh-huh. I should have known. What happened? Where is she? Come on. [Neighs] What did the doc say about her left front? Left front, huh? She's got a swollen tendon. Hey, Brandon, how's she look? Pretty good. You're not one of those rich girls, can't get her hands dirty types, are you? Try me. All right, I think I will. Brandon! Let's set Shannon up. Hey, baby. Hey. Want a treat? Ah, good girl. She loves you! For me, she barely gives the time of day. Ah... Maybe she's just shy around boys. Maybe she just likes you better. So... You ready? Uh, no. I, uh... No, you take her. She's already made her decision. [Laughs] You know, uh, most of the work we do here is outside, so most of the calls just come on Eric's cell or, you know, when our assistant Susan was here, hers. Mm-hmm. I'm okay. Uh, yeah, obviously, 'cause I only got two calls, and both times, it was my... Christine. Well, there, um... I think there's a... Let me see here. What are you looking for? Um, well... There's a... Uh, cellphone. Hey, guys. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? Uh, no. No, I was, um... It was the cellphone. I was... Thought maybe she could use it. You know, she could have it on her side while we're out by the track working, kind of like what Susan used to do, remember? Remember what? Eric, please tell me you remember. Hmm. Yeah, I remember. Shannon, uh, that horse we were talking about, we're trying to push up her hours a little bit, so I think it's time that we get you in a cart so you can start driving her. No. Yeah. Eric, she said she doesn't want to... She doesn't want to ride. Brandon, aren't you supposed to finish making your rounds? Well, yeah. That's right. That's right. I think you had to get the feed out. Huh? Yeah. That's right. Good idea. Got it, yeah. So... What do you say? I said no. I heard you, but how come? What is it? Hmm? Wait a minute. Were you riding when you found out, too? [Chuckles] So was she. What? Yeah. Christine was riding when they told her about you. She didn't ride again for eight years. And then the day she passed her mcats, her mother took her in the car, brought her out here and said, "you better get up on that horse." And not that it means much to you, but we've been together ever since, so... So what do you think? Can I have some time to think about it? Yeah. Okay. You got till tomorrow morning. So, today at work, this little girl comes in. She's four years old, and she looks fine, sounds fine, big smile on her face. So I ask the mother what's wrong with her. She turns to the little girl to have her explain, and she very proudly tells me that she just ate a whole mud pie that she made herself. Then she proceeds, with a big smile, to throw the whole thing up all over me. [Laughs] She felt a lot better after that. I hate him. I hate my dad. I know. Don't you? Oh, sweetheart, it's not important how I feel. What's important is how you feel. He didn't mean to hurt you, Shannon. He just did as his parents told him to do. He loved you so much. He dedicated his entire life to you, even though you may not like, ultimately, how he did it. Try to forgive him, sweetheart. He did his best. He used to talk about you. I think maybe the big reason he kept pretending you were dead... Is because it made his life bearable... 'Cause he never stopped loving you. I should have known. I should have known. Christine, how? How could you have possibly known what they did to you? I hate him. I... I hate him. I know. But I love you. I don't want to be here! [Screams] Remember that she never had her own children. Both of you were lied to. Your mom is still alive. Shannon: I hate him. Daddy? Hey. Hey! What you guys up to? Checking the lines on some of our competition. Oh, yeah? That's cool. Brandon: Hey, go back to big Dukes. All right, Shannon. What's the word? Word on what? I'll do it. Do what? It's time to put Shannon's filly to the test, and Shannon's gonna do it. Wait. Did you just say my filly? Well, she was yours the day you walked in. No one else gets her. Well, yeah, she's... Well, I guess we better name her, huh? Yeah, I guess so. What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you think about her? Rainbow. Brandon: Rainbow? Why rainbow? She's like the bright after the storm, you know? "Rainbow" just seems to say how she makes me feel. Hmm. Well, rainbow it is, then. I'll grab that so you can focus, Joey. Thanks, kiddo. I thought she didn't ride. [Laughs] Just relax. Get warmed up. I'm ready. Go. All right, remember what Eric said. Stay on my behind. Come on, buddy. Little more. Come on. Come on now. Come on, bone chillin. Give me a little more. Whoo hoo! Come on! Come on, girl! You can do it, rainbow! Take the lead! There she goes. She's making her move. Shannon: Whoo! Come on, rainbow! You can do it! Come on, rainbow! Whoo! Ha ha! Whoo! What did she get? Eric: We may have something here. Wow. Shoot. Jeez, can you believe that? Wow, Shannon, that was awesome. You so rule. She, uh, got lucky. Christine: Shannon! Mom! Mom, did you see me? Did you see me? I sure did! I saw it all! Good job. [Laughter] What happened? I got beat. Yeah! Rio: Oh, yes, you did! [Laughs] Mitchell: Pull! [Shotgun fires] Pull! [Fires] Good one, Mr. p! That's 10 for 10. Hey, remember that new filly of Eric Parker's, the Chestnut? The one with the bad leg? Yeah. Pull! [Fires] Joey says she's been running real hot. She beat bone chillin by two lengths at practice yesterday. Really? Really. Richie. Uh, yes Mr. p. Get me a scotch rocks, would you? Oh, sure thing. Um, can I get you anything, Ms. mcneil? Mitchell: She's fine. Well, good for Eric. Did you hear what I said, Mitch? Yeah, I heard. Pull! [Fires] She beat bone chillin by two lengths. So you said. In a race she's never run before, driven by Christine's 16-year-old daughter, who's never driven before. Pull! [Fires] Ah... You hear me now? [Laughs] Announcer: They're off and racing. Camille goes for the lead. Only one second. Catch me gets away third. Mighty hera fourth. Rainbow pacing fifth. Track master sixth. And mystikal in seventh... [Continues indistinctly] Catch me second. In third's track master, on the move on the outside... Rainbow comes to the outside, followed by mighty hera. Less than 1/8 of a mile to go. On the outside, it's Camille with the lead... She gonna take it? No... But she could. Yeah. Track master, what a filly. Rainbow on the outside... And it's track master, mighty hera... She did good. Whoo! What did you get on rainbow's time? It's 1:59.03. You better hope that little girl doesn't race against you, or big, bad Mitchell Prescott could get beaten by a neophyte. Neophyte? I'll buy that horse if you can spell it. N-e-o-p-h-y-t-e. It's Latin for neophitus, which means "novice." That's good, babe. That's real good. Shannon. Hey. I, uh, wanted rainbow to have some time in the whirlpool before I turned her out. Mm-hmm. So you noticed that, too? Yeah. She should have won that race, Eric. I mean, not that I think that what she did out there was amazing, but... No, no. Dave's not you, though. She doesn't like the whip. If he just keeps that in mind... It's not the whip. It's not the course or the conditions or anything else. It's you, because you love her, and she loves you. I better get going. I'll see you. Oh, by the way, I think rainbow's ready to enter the maiden claims race next week. A claims race? Be good practice for her. Now, I know she means the world to you, but in the world of racing, she's just a $3,000 filly going up against these horses, 15 thou and up. If it were a year from now, guarantee someone would pick her, but right now, they'd be a fool to grab her. But what about her practice runs? I mean, she finished third in her first maidens race. Nah, it won't matter. Right now, we just need to get her some time in with some pros. Then we'll turn her into one. I'll see you. Announcer: ...Right out in the lead. Liberty gets away second. Oh so slow third. Rainbow on the outside in fourth. Hitchall fifth. Out and in racing sixth. Be there is... It's all set to go, Mr. p. Oh so slow second as she passes down for the first time. Coming to the 3/8 mark on top. Cruising leads the pack, fading on the outside, now fourth. Little more than 1/8 of a mile to go. Go! Let's go! Cruising with the lead. Racing second, out and in. Coming to the wire. Come on! Rainbow coming back on the outside. You can do it! Come on! Be there! Rainbow second. Hitchall in third. That was cool. Number three, rainbow, has been claimed by the Prescott stable. Prescott stable claiming number three, rainbow. Come on. Sorry, kid. That's, uh, quite an impressive horse you had, young lady. Do you know what a claims race is? Shannon, it's all right. What are you doing? Eric, how could you enter her horse in a claims race when you know how much it meant to her? What were you thinking? Ahem. I'm sorry this happened to you, baby. Maybe you should consider aligning yourself with a horseman a bit more savvy than your mother's, you know, boyfriend. All right, look, I'll give you 25,000 for her, eh? You want 30,000? All right, I'll give you 45,000 for her. It's three times what you paid. It's 15 times what she's worth. Mitchell: That's a whole lot of cash. What do you want? [Clears throat] Payback. You're pathetic. Come see me about a job, baby. You've got a way with horses. You really do. See you around, Eric. Get the horse. Yes, sir. Okay, time for me to take it. Shannon, come on. Come on. Give it to me now. Shannon, come on. We can't do this. Shannon. I'm sorry. Okay, come on. Let me have it. I'm sorry. You gotta give it to him. Come on. Come on, sweetie. She is not an it. She is a she, and she has a name. Say her name! Say it! Say her name! Come on. We gotta go. Say her name! Let go. I'm so sorry. Prescott will probably ride her now. It happens. It happens? Just happens? Like my father dying just happens? And finding out you're alive just happens? And having my heart be ripped out again just happens? I wish I could tell you it didn't. I do. I want to die. Oh, God. I know. Christine: You're gonna be okay. You are. I love you so much. Chris, I'm gonna make it up to her. Hey. I don't want to hear it. Listen, this guy is out of his mind. Did you hear what he said to me? He said this is payback. He's crazy. You know that rainbow will only disappoint him if he tries to run her, but he would rather have her dead than see her back in your hands. You know how he is. [Sighs] She's got a mind of her own, Mr. p. She misses the girl. Mr. pritchard. Yes, sir? Make her forget the girl. I don't think... That's right. You don't. I do the thinking. [Neighing] Mitchell: The horse is weak. [Rainbow neighing] Look at her. Out of control. [Neighing echoes] [Doorbell rings] Hi. Oh, she's out back. Hey. I know it's not your fault. He would have found another way to get to you. He just... Just happened to luck into this one. I'm really sorry. It's all right. Yeah? [Whip cracks] [Rainbow neighing] She's done, Mitch. Give her back. What did you say? Give her back? Mitch, please. Did you say give that horse back to Eric Parker? [Whip cracks] I'd rather see the animal dead. [Whip cracks] Get rid of the horse. What do you want me to do with it? I never want to see the animal again. [Whip cracking] [Sighs] [Neighs] Man: So, my cousin there in New York, he thinks if we set up a website, we'll be able to get some more business. What do you think of that? A what? A website. Floyd, come on. Get with it. The web! Huh? Oh, jee... [Horn honking] What the hell? [Honking] Maybe he wants you to pull over, ed. You think? [Honking] Maybe it's the cops. Cops? No, no. Cops aren't gonna be driving a big-deal SUV like that. Come on. Oh, yeah. [Honking] All right, already! [Rainbow neighing, stamping] You want something, mister? Yeah, that horse you're hauling. Come again? I'll buy her from you right now, cash. Ho. Hold on. Hold on there, son. Hold on. We're supposed to put her down, buddy. Deal says we gotta have her done by sunrise. [Rainbow groans] Yeah, but whether she's dog meat or in someone else's barn doesn't really matter much, does it? And this way, you make a few extra bucks, throw back a few, call it a day. Huh. Well, uh... Not gonna come cheap. I mean, we're in business. We got a reputation to protect. Yes, sir. You're gonna have to dig real deep for this here filly. How deep? Well, I guess I'll have to catch up with you guys some other time then. Huh? Whoa. Ho. Wait. Where you... cowboy, wait a minute. We're negotiating. We're talking, aren't we? Right? I mean, uh, he's mixed-up. You're mixed-up, old man. Jeez! He's saying 800, and he means 600. 400? 500. 500. [Rainbow stamping] 50. 450. Three-fi... Is it... I'm firm. You drive a tough bargain, sir. Well. 400, it is. Yee-ha! [Laughs] [Knock on door] Eric: Max? It's Eric and Christine. Open up! [Knocks] [Knob rattles] Max, it's an emergency. Christine: Max? Are you there? [Groans] Try the door. See if it's open. Come on. Go in! Ohh! Christine, honey. I need your help, Max. Can't imagine why. It's a horse. It's bad. My condolences. [Laughs] Max, I do not give one damn about your sob story right now, Max. I am here for my kid. A horse is dying, and you're gonna save her. Now, do you understand me, old man? It was good to see you, Max. [Snorts] Baby, what did they do to you? Ah, the temperature's getting hotter and hotter. Hey, Brandon, see if you can grab some bute or banamine. All right. What about an ice boot? Yeah, good idea. Make it fast, huh? Hurry up! She's been beat bad. She's got a lot of cuts and bruises. Eric: This horse, she's been... she's been beat all over. We gotta keep her on her feet. We can't let her lay down. I got some coming. How you doing, kid? Who are you? Max, this is Shannon. Shannon, Max. Shannon is Christine's daughter. Oh, right. I remember. You're the famous horse trainer, right? Legends die hard, kid. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. What can I do? All right, look, you get real close to her, and you encourage her. Get right by her nose, hmm. Perk her up. Keep her attention. Okay. Let me hear you. Come on. Hey, come on, rainbow. You can do this. All right, honey? All right? Stay with me. Please. Eric: Yeah, everywhere I touch, she's just flinching. I was thinking about maybe having you come out for an internal exam, see if she might need an X-ray. Hang in there, sweetheart. Eric: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's been a real rough night. Shannon: Hang in there. [Horse neighs] [No audible dialogue] [Groans] You made it, girl. She should be dead, right, Max? That's right. But you aren't, are you, baby? I love you, rainbow. Max, I won't let her run. Oh, I would never tell her not to run. She can run. She'll be fine, better than fine, but, uh... I couldn't ask for anything more than that, you know? Right, Max? Pretty cool, huh? Joey: Is that who I think it is? Max Donovan. Eric and Christine brought him to come help out. Can you believe it? No, actually, I can't. Max and rainbow, huh? Mr. Prescott. Yes, Richard? You, uh, might want to take this. Yes? [Frogs croaking] Heh. One day at a time, old man. Heh. [Knock on door] Psst. Psst, Christine. Come here. Max! Hey, shh. What are you doing out here? Who told Prescott that I was working on your horse? Oh, God. Well, it can't be anyone from our camp. Yeah, well, somebody from the camp did, which means that who is working with your little girl is playing both ends against the middle. But everyone who works for Eric knows the history with Mitchell. I mean, they know how he is. They're loyal to Eric. Yeah. Well, look, Max, you can't stay out here, and you can't go home, so why don't you... I'm not. I just came here to tell you to watch your back, and I'll take care of mine. What are you gonna do, run? Look, I'm too old for this kind of stuff, baby. I just gotta grab as much life as I can for as long as I can, and that's it. It's how you choose to live that life that counts, Max. [Sighs] Do what you want. You always do. [Sighs] [Door closes] I feel it. I know she could pull it off. What makes you say that? She loves it. Every time we work her, she gets better and better. Well, that's good to know, because I'm putting you behind her. What? That's right. In the Pennsylvania cup. Me? No, no way. Not me. Okay, then. I don't let her go. You wouldn't do that to her. Shannon, you give us the best chance to win. I'm not gonna put another driver behind rainbow, so if you're not ready, she's out. Eric, I can't. What's the worst thing that could happen? You lose? So what? You don't win. There'll be other races. Come on. Think about it. How cool would that be to drive rainbow in the Pennsylvania cup? Win or lose. [Horses neighing] I was gonna get out of here... Before anybody else came. Here. Let me help you. Oh. Ow! Ow! Easy. [Grunting] What? Are you gonna help me get my horse back all the way, or what? Help me get her ready for the cup. She wants it. She wants it real bad, more than any other horse I ever seen. Keystar was the greatest of the greats. That was Eric's horse. Eric loved that horse, just like you love rainbow. He was a champion from his first steps. He ran damn near till it killed him. Rainbow's just like that. She'll run through fire for you. Prescott, he'll do anything he can to keep a horse wearing the Parker colors from ever winning the Pennsylvania cup, ever. Bone chillin, not my favorite, but Prescott, he's got one that's better. It's called thunder. Now thunder is gonna follow the rainbow. Now we're gonna have to move fast and hard, but not here, and not with this crew. Well, if not here, then where? There's a ranch down the way, kind of a rehab. Definitely unsympathetic to the prescotts. We could go there. Okay. All right? Let's do this. Okay. You sure? Yeah. I'm sure. Come on. Come on, rainbow. Let's see what you got now. Come on. Wild wind carry me okay, girl? That's it. You got it. To a place good girl. Good. I'd rather be all right, one more time now. Wild wind carry me use your legs now, Shannon. All right. Ease up on her now. Don't let her get away. Wild wind pure and strong she looks good. Sing your siren song I'm gonna help you get ready for the Pennsylvania cup. She wants it. She wants it real bad, more than any other horse I ever seen. Hoo ooh ooh... She'll run through fire for you. Stay right on his tail till you come around to the last turn, and then, you let her go. She's got the stuff inside of her. The only problem you're gonna have is holding her back... Until that last turn. How I dream to ride with you and see the sights wild winds do around the world in 80 days calling all the way... When we get to that Pennsylvania cup, you let her go. Mm-hmm. All right? Okay. And then there's nothing anybody can do. Calling hoo ooh ooh now thunder is gonna follow the rainbow. Hoo ooh ooh hey. What's up? Looks like you got something from the Pennsylvania cup. Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Hey, uh, where's Shannon and rainbow? I haven't seen them around in a couple weeks. Uh, they're just up the road a bit. She's training rainbow, getting ready for the Pennsylvania cup. She's looking good, too. Just want to keep it low-key so Mitchell doesn't find out. Of course not. Max has got a great filly to work with. Yeah, he does. She's looking really good. She's been flying lately. Okay. Eric: Joey! It's called the Taylor farm. Mitch knows who they are. You want their address? Sorry, Eric. So tell me what he knows. He knows rainbow's not dead. He knows Max helped save her. He doesn't know how she's doing or where she is. And he definitely doesn't know you're planning on entering her in the Pennsylvania cup. Well, you better let him know. Finish what you started. Go on. Go ahead. Call him. Really, Joey, come on. Do it. Mitchell: Hello. Joey: Mr. Prescott? Yes. Sir, I've looked everywhere. Neither she nor the horse are anywhere. No one's talking. Well, he probably won't believe you anyway. Captain Martin? Eric Parker, Parker stables. You're a good boy. Come on. Come on. Mitchell: Ahem. So... What farms are near Parker's? There's a lot. Mm-hmm, okay. What farms are near Parker's who would still be stupid enough to do business with Max? Taylor. Of course. [Kiss] You take care of my horse. Huh? Christine: You're working with a great trainer. Trust him. Listen to him. [Music playing] [No audible dialogue] Christine: You've got a good horse. Work with her. She needs you. And have fun. Have fun, sweetheart. Your dad loved you so much, so much. Try to forgive him, sweetheart, not for me or for him, but do it for yourself. I love you. You really look like him. Really? Yeah. Do I have grandparents? Oh, wow. My mom died of breast cancer two years ago, and my dad died in a boating accident last October. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, me, too. Here, rainbow. Come here. Rainbow girl. Come on. That's a girl. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the meadows and the 35th annual Pennsylvania cup! Any shower activity, so we are in great shape for your parades, your picnics, your parties, and we are just minutes away from the big race. The radar screen is clear, and that's good news. But we are here in Western Pennsylvania around Pittsburgh... [Footsteps] Shannon. The summer has gone fast. Yeah. Working with Eric, doing a little racing, that could be a pretty cool way to wind down after school, don't you think? Always worked for me. I think it's gonna be a good year, mom. Me, too. Announcer: Number one, rocket, from the mullwine stable. Number two, starlight from the Johnson barn. Number three, rainbow out of the Parker stables. Number four... Ahem. Where's Richard? How the hell should I know? Whoa, whoa. Now. No matter what happens, you stay in your Lane. Okay. You got it? Okay. Okay. Okay. I wish dad were here. He is. Ladies and gentlemen, the horses are coming to the track for the 35th Pennsylvania cup! [Crowd cheering] [Bugle playing call to the post] They're off and pacing, going right up to the Lane. Joe's jamming, thunder on the outside... Lady Courtney gets away here. Storm chaser fourth. Grace in fifth. Going right out for the lead, that's rainbow. Joe's jamming, thunder on the outside. Lady Courtney gets way out... What's wrong, Mitchell? You look worried. About what? You tell me. Rainbow pacing third. Storm chaser fourth. Starlight on the outside, fifth. Corner three wide, down the back side, drawing to the 3/4 mile. On top of the field, it's lady Courtney. Grace in second. Joe's jamming, great move. Afternoon, Mitchell. Allen. Can I get you or your boys something to drink? Dinner? No, thank you. We're on duty. Really? Sounds like that girl of Parker's is giving thunder a hell of a workout. Down the back side. Starlight, air express, and rocket trails at the end. It's a race around the turn, down the field. And it's lady Courtney, rainbow on the outside. Better hope he loses fair and square, Mitch. Really? Got to arrest you. Arrest me, huh? That's inconvenient. Attempted murder, conspiracy, and, well, just a whole bunch of stuff. Let me walk out of here on my own, Alan. Do that for me, would you? You don't deserve it, Mitchell. I know. Thunder on the outside. In the Lane, it's lady Courtney. Storm chaser in fourth. Starlight on the outside path. Rainbow on the outside. Thunder on the inside. Storm chaser, Joe's jamming down the back side. And they're free for the quarter mile, flying down the field, yes. Lady Courtney... [Music playing] Max: You hold her back until that last turn. She'll do the rest. She'd run through fire for you. Let her go, and then there's nothing anybody can do. It's rainbow on the outside. Thunder on the inside second. Down the stretch, they come. It's starlight, air express, rocket on the outside. Come on! Go! Come on! We have three of 'em across the track with 1/8 of a mile to go. Thunder on the outside. Rainbow on the outside coming to the wire. Either! It's anybody's horse race Shannon! Thunder with the lead. Rainbow on the outside. The wire. It's... Rainbow! [Neighs] Christine: Whoo! [Cheering] [Music playing] [Camera snaps] [Instrumental playing]
