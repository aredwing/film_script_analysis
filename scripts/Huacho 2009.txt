Manuel, unplug the TV and the fridge. - Maybe someone is stealing the cables. - Yeah, people do that these days. - This power outage reminds me of a story... - Hurry up, Manuel. ...about when my father was a worker... One day, he went to Lautaro for his pay... On his way back, he had to walk through a 500-meter-long tunnel. And in the middle of it, the light went off, just like now. Suddenly, he was attacked by striking miners. Who were asking for a pay raise. Raising their pickaxes, they shouted "Get him!" - Mom, can I have 1,000 pesos? - Thats too much. So the leader said: "Since you are a miner like us we will help you, brother"... Listen to Grandpa. So all the miners chipped in some money for my father to take... - 400? - I said no! Grandpa, could you keep it short, please. Thanks. Your water. - Last but not least, right? - Especially in this heat. Its hard to close. The zipper is tight. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, sweetie. - Take care of yourself. - You too. Did your father take his sweater? I dont know, I dont think so. You know he forgets everything. Here it is. Hes such a scatterbrain, he never remembers anything. Alejandra, how are you? - Fine. How are you? - Fine, thank you. - I see its ready. - Yes, Im almost done. Come have a look at my doughnuts.

Good, but don't forget anything, What about the "cazuela"? I know which chicken to kill. Perfect then, Im off... Actually, I need to talk to you. Quickly then, Im in a hurry. You might get angry, I always ask you the same thing... I wanted to ask you for an advance. Again? Live told you, I dont make enough. Alejandra, put your thinking cap on. I've given you an advance two months in a row. You need to start controlling your expenses. I have taxes to pay soon, you know. And I dont get paid right away either. I have to go to the agency, to pick up the checks. - Hi. - Hi, Eva. - How are you? - Fine and you? Pretty good. A little tired from the heat. Everythings tiny. Tiny mirror, tiny shoes. - Stop complaining. - Everythings "Mama Smurf" sized! Here, taste this. I need to ask you for a favor. - Could you lend me some money? - Money? - 20,000 pesos. - And Mama Smurf? I asked, but she said no. She always says yes. Not this time. Im broke, too. I paid some bills yesterday, and gave the rest to my mom. The "gringos" might tip you. Service is included! Youre broke, I understand. You know I'd lend it to you if I had it. Ok then, hurry up. And the reconnection charge? If I pay today, will it be restored today? I want to be sure its restored today. Ok, Ill get there as soon as possible. Thanks. Well continue our visit this way, please.

And before you leave, dont forget to put the "cazuela" pot on the table. Ill put it back in the fridge later. Ok, Ill take care of it. This house is the biggest in the farm. We call it "The Pearl of the Farm". Houses like this one were built in Chile, during Colonial times. They were built The distance you could travel in a day by cart or on horseback. In those days, of course, there were no roads. Mr. Francisco, drop me off here, please. Im going to the mall.

I left you with some neighbors to go get the midwife. I had to cross rivers in the middle of a storm, at night. I finally found a house, but it was dark... - It wasnt her house? - No. It was pitch black out there... I asked where she lived, it was further off. I kept searching all night, in despair. - Bye Grandma. - Bye. Bye. Bye. The baby's chances of survival were diminishing. When I got home, he was dead. I almost forgot. Why are you back? To give this paper to Grandma. Look. Thats lovely! Show it to Grandpa. - Where did you do it? - At school. - Its hard to read. - "Fresh Cheese." You have to take it to the highway. Thats right. Youll need a sturdy board to put it on... so it won't fly away. Let me see, Mom. Sorry. Do we have Spanish or Math today? I can't remember what the teacher said. I brought the Spanish textbook. Guys, do you know where Dusan is? No idea. Theres three of you, Ill be fourth, ok? - Yeah, Ill tell him. - Im fourth. Yeah, Ill tell him! Dusan, Im fourth. Thats right, I forgot.

Last summer, I went to Via del Mar. Via is nice. Theres the beach, the sun... I was there with my mom, and my moms boyfriend. We went to the movies with a friend of his. And we met these guys who dared us to race them. So we did. It was awesome. - Bye. - Bye. Dusan, lend it to me? - Lend it to me. - No. - Im the only one left. - You were the sixth to arrive.

Do we get a group grade? There is a provisional qualification for the whole group, so start working. You, why are you throwing stones? You can not do that, stop! Go and play with something else! What tool are you using? No, youre not looking in the right place. Open the window ...there it is a tool called History... yeah... and there you can undo the mistake. Hold on. Whats wrong, Hernandez? Sir, Dusan and Letelier are playing with a PSP. Yes. And? Videogames are forbidden at school. Yes, but thats my problem. Go back to class, Ill deal with it later. - Ok. - Go back to class.

In 30 minutes, well start reading the speeches. Each group will read its speech. Choose a person to read it. Letelier, Fernandez and Gasic, I saw you playing with that videogame - Put it away right now! - Yeah mister, just a second. - I said right now! - Yeah mister, one more goal I said now! Put it in a bag. Yeah, yeah. If you dont put it away I will take it! Put it away. Gasic, put it away. And since you seem to know so much about the subject, you will be the first group to read your speech. And for you it will count in your final grade. - What? - It will count in your final grade. Quiet, and get to work. If you have a doubt, ask me. Excuse me. Manuel, its so late! - Are you tired? - Yeah. Why aren't you wearing your smock? Its in my backpack. You have to wear it, otherwise youll ruin your uniform. - Mrs. Mara Ins sent me to Chillan. - I was about to ask. - Next time, we could meet up. - And how? You let me know in advance. - So I can pick you up. - Ok. Are you tired? Look what I have for you here. - What is it? - This little candy. I don't want it now. Save it for later. - Ok. - Thanks.

Move a little. Thats comfier. You can sleep, if you want. Cornelio! - Your sweater... - I forgot it. - Don't be in such a rush! - Thanks. I didnt do my military service, it wasnt mandatory. My father died and I was alone taking care of my mother and ten brothers. Being the eldest, I had to look after the house. I would have liked to do it, but I couldnt. I have a son in the army. Hes a professional soldier. After serving in Coyhaique, they sent him to Arica, then to Santiago, and now hes in Linares waiting for a promotion. - Good luck. - You too. Youre too used to being pushed. Im sick of it. - Come on, Don Cornelio. - With this we are dropping dead. He got used to it. He just loves being pushed. - Ok, see now. - See now. - Bye Don Cornelio. - Bye bye mister. Lets have some water. Don't lean against the switch, youre turning off the sign outside. As I was telling you, our daughter has a kid. But its not a problem. Id like to help her out. Don Cornelio, those things happen. Her brothers are in Santiago. Im putting the papers in order, so I can leave her with something. Don Segundo. You again! Please stop doing that! This is the third time I have to move you. Our customers cant see the neon sign, dammit! - Whats the matter?! Who do you think you are!? Relax. - Nobody bangs on my table! - Relax, will you? Easy. I'm talking with him. Did you see how he banged on my table? You... So you can help them to plant and harvest. I will help your grandson. He is studying in Chillan? Grandpa! Grandpa! Hello. Come on. Were waiting outside. - Hello. - Nice to meet you, boy. Now we have to go, but we will talk later. Were waiting for you. - Dont forget you bag. - Oh, right. Bye my friends, Ill see you soon, God Willing. You never change. The other day you forgot your cap and now you almost left your bag. I mightve forgotten my bag, but not my friends. Your grandpa always comes here. I come here every day. To have some fun. You almost forgot me, I waited for hours... If we hadnt shown up, would you have drunk till morning? Maybe not till morning, but a little longer, yes. - Hi, Dad. - Hows my girl? Fine. - What are you doing here? - Mrs. Mara Ines sent me to Chillan. She was in the same bus as Manuel. - How about the drinks? - I have a few, so Im a little tipsy now... Let me tell you a story of my youth, a story you don't know... Looking for work we left with some friends to the mountains. And leaving Chillan to the east, between Pinto and Recinto, we found this big farm. There was a sawmill, some wheat fields... - Back when you traveled the country? - Yes, I had to make a living. So we asked who we should talk to, and we were told to go see a guy named... Gutierrez. He was the overseer... - Mom, Grandpas told this story before. - You know how he is, eat! ...and he sent us to harvest the wheat - Can I play with your cell phone? - The batterys dead with the power outage. He would reply: "Good work you did today, the boss will be happy" Wed say, "Howdy, Gutierrez!" But he used to hit the bottle a little too much. And his health started failing. So much it was so, that he couldnt even lift his head when we called his name. Hed sit there all day, in his chair. And one fine day... - You are not eating, Ale? - No, mom. Until one good day, Gutierrez died, and we had to organize the funeral. He had this dog, that was so attached to him... that when we said "Gutierrez" the dog would wag its tail. But later, the dog too lost its spunk. It became sad. So we called the dog "Gutierrez", too. The dog was sick with sadness. He hide behind some logs... And even when we yelled "Gutierrez!" It laid still, like its master had. - It wouldnt get up. - No. So we ended up burying it too, just like Gutierrez. What do you think? Too bad both of them died. But its a good story, nonetheless. Theres one more thing I want to say... Maybe because Im tipsy... Im not as good a worker as I used to be. Im fencing the pasture, as you know, a work that used to take me a couple of days... But I've been at it for two weeks, and I cant see the end of it. Well see if I even finish. - Its your age, Dad. - Yeah, I suppose... Sometimes I think about all the things Ive done in my life... and of how it all fades away, slowly, day after day. And then I start reflecting, my mind turning for answers:"Why do I have so little left?" - Time takes its toll. - Yes. Why work so much, anyways? You know your brothers will haggle over the land? I agree, Dad. - The light, finally! - Great! You know youre not the only heir, so why work so hard? You must like it. - Mom, can I take your plate? - Yes, thanks. You havent eaten, Dad. All you do is talk. Manuel, plug the fridge in. The wine warms me up. Keep the leftovers for tomorrow. The wine warms you up... - Eat your corn, Manuel. - What? Your corn. You havent eaten a thing. Keep the leftovers for tomorrow.
