I never got to him say how much he loved her. I would love to see you again ... if you do not mind. You do not have a girlfriend, right? Well, there is Orzula, of course. She is very beautiful. Oh, yeah? But not so interesting like you. We may find ourselves on Wednesday afternoon. My grandparents think I'm for classes of wood carving ... but now I go silent meetings. I'm not a fanatic or something. Almost everyone cries, you know. I'd rather be with you. Well, here I am. Can you pick then? That would be good. Until Thursday, then. Goodbye. Goodbye. Aah! Come in, Miep. Sit. No doubt you have read ... as the Germans emptied the provinces of Jews ... and sent them all here to Amsterdam. Our own county Jew feels compelled to cooperate.

"/ i Or "The Secret Annex". You have to say something. Why cause trouble? The Van Maarsen not say anything. It has its reasons. What about the neighbors? Maybe they heard something ... pipes, people talking. -God knows what else. -I get out of it. They catch up! They will know that you been hiding from them!

I hate that word! Just do not light things seriously. That's all I ask. I think I am old enough to make my decisions. Moreover, he likes my smile. / i Well, it went well. Since I was little ... I thought that my parents had the perfect marriage. I do not remember even to hear them discuss. The Daddy used to serve the Mom breakfast in bed. I can not imagine my father to do this to my mother. Probably beat her with the board. or vice versa. Mommy loves Daddy. I am sure. But sometimes I think father married her ... because he thought she would be a good wife. You see the difference? I asked the father once about it. You know what he said? "Your mother is very obedient." Obedient. I want more than that. I think .../ i let the Nazis kill each other themselves. Less work for the British and the Russians. By this time next month ... have our meal Sabbath in freedom. This is not a meal. This is garbage. Your employees could do more for us.

Now you have to envy my Charlotte. / i think you're the only person alone in the world? / i Yes, who has glass roofs .../ i What does that mean? This modern family. It is always the same argument and again. Some people never learn. Should also have some lessons. It's selfish, it's hysterical and is bossy! I'm not bossy! As if some ideal mother ... you can not even control his own son. Wait / i -Please be quiet! -Sit down! Stop me saying what to do! Someone has been a bad influence. I'm proud of you. I suppose that finally had enough. It is a beautiful story. You really think so? All will be delighted when know you have it in you. People will think I I was silly .. or worse. Margot remember the stories ... that Dad told us on the two Paulas? Bright. The good and Paula Paula bad. Everyone expects me Paula is a bad ... So try not to disappoint them. The Paula is only good for me. I keep it here. Do not let it out. Well .. Why not show them who you really are? The Paula is not good strong enough. She hides and leaves Paula bad about ... except in my journal. Well, whoever who has written this ... I think it's very good. You know, now you got old enough to know. There is no harm in being on their own. I try, Margot. Seriously, I try. The other crossing is my way. Well, good night. Good night. Just a second. Hello? I. .. I have an information. Information?

Well, now it's your turn. You're in Vienna. Me too. I soon discovered. Papers? You quit. Gies. You quit. Strange that her husband not here. Are not you ashamed?
