It happened in Lodalen in Nordfjord where a big piece of the mountain fell out. Resulting in a major tidal wave, which killed 63 people. The tidal wave surged through Lake Loenvatnet and was 40 meters tall when it reached land. 58 years have passed since the Tafjord Disaster in Sunnmre. 40 people lost their lives when a huge piece of the mountain fell into the sea. There are numbers today that show over 300 unstable mountains in Norway. Everyone knows that it's only a matter of time until the next big avalanche. Geiranger is threatened with what people believe will become a new Tafjord Disaster. By the fjord hangs kerneset- - a giant, unstable part of the mountain that one day will fall out. Then, 7 million cubic meters of rocks will slide straight into the fjord- -and create an enormous tidal wave. No place else can you find as active as in kerneset. The question is: Can the people be warned before the mountain slides into the fjord? THE WAVE What is this? I'm 40! Come on! - Hello? - Hey, daddy. - What's going on? - Mommy is fixing the sink. Could you get me some pliers? Can't we call a plumber? Here. I don't need any plumber, but could I get some plumbing pliers? - It's in there. - Here you go, mom. How did you know what those pliers looked like? Everybody knows that. There we go. No need for this when we move. This house has soul. What's a "soul"? A soul is just some nonsense your mother believes in. - What did you say? - Nothing. The apartment is brand new. And then you have the view. The entire city is right outside our doorstep. And everything is controlled by remote. - Lights, music, blinds... - Can you send the broccoli? And the thing I liked the most was- - that you can open and close the door with your cell phone. You have this key app. - And you trust that? - No, I had to double check. I've never seen a key app before in my life. Come on! Idun, what do you think? Throw it away? Or...? You're going to throw your shirts away? Aren't they nice, though? New place, new line of work... Okay, you know what? I think you need a suit. From now on you'll need a suit and tie. And you need to get a nice, new haircut. This is going to be great. - Why don't we just screw this and stay here? - No, we've decided. It's going to be great. Maybe even I'll get more of your attention than that mountain. You want attention? - You want me to give you my attention? - No tickling! No! Not on the kitchen table! We're preparing food there tomorrow! KERNES/GEIRANGER PREPAREDNESS CENTER CENTER FOR AVALANCHE SURVEILLANCE 102,1 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL The six on the seven. Everything as normal? 0,3 mm the last 24 hours. That's way within the limits. Hey. How's everything in the old Oil City? As usual. A lot of suits. - Classic capitalist attire. - How long has this been on? Two days in the big city and he's a gourmet. Yeah, that's how it goes. "Thanks for everything"... Sounds like it's your funeral, Kristian. Then you can make the cake next time. - I hope that won't be for a long time. - It looks fantastic, Margot. Well... Dear Kristian, who could imagine... this would be your last day with us. That doesn't sound like a funeral at all...! Here, Jacob. The thing is, it's not only up here that we have mountains. There are mountains in the North Sea as well. I understand the guys in the oil business that would want a guy like you. You're skilled and dedicated. I know I speak for everyone when I say that you'll be sorely missed. - It'll be sad. - Thanks. Though it'll be fucking great not having to triple check everything all the time. - Cheers to that. - Cheers. - Number 5 too? - Looks like it. - What's going on? - The groundwater suddenly sank. In number 4 and 5. Then we lost the connection. Can you show me? - Get a camera feed. - Two seconds. Are you zooming in? - No other movements? - No, dead quiet. - Maybe a bad connection? - It looks stable. We'll have a look next time we're up there. Can someone please turn off that fucking alarm?! Kristian? Kristian! The mountain is quiet. It's okay. Go pack your stuff. We're in control. - Look, mom, I managed to fit everything. - That's great, honey. - Want me to take these too? - Yeah, you can take the boxes with books. - Isn't he going to help? - Yes, actually, he is. - Hey, how goes the packing? - Pretty well. That wrinkle, Kristian... I thought that was supposed to disappear now. Something weird happened to the groundwater today. That's not your responsibility any more. That mountain has been there for a thousand years and it'll probably be there for a thousand more. Now finish packing so the moving van can go tomorrow. Pack down that wrinkle too. Now, get moving. - Do you see how mommy is messing with daddy? - Everyone has to contribute, daddy. How are you doing, buddy? I like it here. I know that Geiranger isn't the center of the world, but... It's safe. It's home. I know this is hard. It's not that. But your mom and I made a decision that we believe is best for our family. It's not always easy to be the one that has to make tough decisions. Then what's next? After we've lived in Stavanger for two years. Then it's up and out to move again? This whole fucking country is all rocks. What's going on here? Are you guys moving? Come here. - You too. - Me as well. Hey, Sondre. We'll see how long you'll handle it, only concrete and... And Kristian with a tie around his neck. That'll be new. - It'll be a transition. - Yeah, a bit tight around the neck. - Are you ready? - Yeah, mostly. These guys will take the ferry today and I'll stay here and work for a few more days. - So you're not leaving now? - No, you won't get rid of me just yet. - Daddy, it's our turn. - Are we going or what? Wait here. I won't be long. - I've bought an apartment and everything. - Hey, I need to show you something. HOTEL GEIRANGER DOWNTOWN GEIRANGER 1,7 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL - Hey, Vibeke. - Oh, you're here? I thought I'd help out a bit. Welcome to Geiranger. Sorry about the wait. - That's no problem at all. - What are your names? - Maria and Phillip Poulsen. - Let's see if we have a room for you. - Did the others leave already? - I think they'll be on the ferry soon. Imagine that there are no problems with the sensors, but with the wires down there. Right? All mountains consist of layers. Ours is no different. Our drilling holes go through all these layers. You said that the groundwater disappeared right before we lost contact. Groundwater won't just disappear like that. It finds new ways, makes new layers. That creates friction. Which then again make the other layers move. And if they moved enough, they might've cut off our wires. Then we'll drill some new holes and switch a few sensors. That's no big deal. No- But if the pressure from the mountain above these displacements was great enough... There won't be any expansion before the slide. And there won't be any warnings. CONTROL STATION EAGLE'S NES KERNESET, STORFJORDEN 874,1 METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL Hey, be careful! That's Geiranger's greatest tourist attraction! When you're at such a beautiful place then you should be able to see the fjord. I understand that so well. Let me know if you need something. See you later. Hi, Sondre. What? Where are you now? Okay? Shit! Do we have contact? - Do you have picture? - Yeah, we can see you. That's good to know. You'll check number 4 and I'll check number 5. Yessiree, Bob! Kristian? - This is not natural wear. - No, something's obviously happening. There's a lot of movement in that mountain now, you know that? We'll investigate this further, Kristian. We'll take care of it. What do you mean? More samples, drill more holes. More holes? Are you crazy? Do I really have to remind you guys what might happen here? We're talking about an 80 meter tall wave here! After ten minutes, Geiranger is no more! We know what might happen just as well as you do. It sure doesn't seem like it! What the fuck do you want me to do? You want me to press this, and create total panic? Cancel the tourist season before it starts? Since when did you start caring about tourism? That's not what this is about! What do you think will happen- - if we start crying wolf every time something happens up there? What the fuck do we do when the slide actually happens?! Then tell me what we should do. Code Yellow. I want the mountain, fully staffed at all hours. Yeah. What do you thing? Are you just gonna stand there and watch?! Jacob? Kristian, listen. I understand that you're upset. I know you only want what's best, but now you'll have to calm down a little. We've found some torn wires. There's nothing indicating that something is going to happen. The mountain is quiet, Kristian. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. I'm not going to... Didn't bother waiting call MOM Oh, fuck me... Jesus... Oh man... You're so fucked... There's a visitor for you. Are you totally mad? You can't just leave the kids in the car and work for several hours. - I know, I'm sorry. - You don't even work there anymore. - I fucked up. - Yes, you did. I had a bad feeling, and... Yeah... There won't be any Stavanger today. - Nei... - Okay... I think you guys will sleep at the hotel tonight. - Great. - You wanna do that? Okay? - Then you'll try again tomorrow? - Yeah. But I want to sleep at home. That place is empty, honey, and not nice at all. I want to say goodbye to the house. If you want to do that, then we'll make sure of that. Is that all right? The house it is, then. - You want to come along? - Nah. - I'll get you a room in the hotel. - Yes, please. Say goodbye from me as well. There we go. Good night, my dear. Bye, boss. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay, let's go get your stuff. - What was your name? My name is Sondre Eikjord. - Daddy, can I sit in the front? - Of course! Okay, seat belt on. And tighten. Okay, we're ready. - Daddy? - Yeah? Are you and mommy going to get a divorce now? No. No, we're not getting a divorce. We had a little fight and later we'll be friends again. And then everything will be alright again. I hope... - That's life. - That's life! Here's your room. There. I hope the room is as you hoped it would be. - Enjoy. - I will. Can I go work for a little? You know which bottles you can't touch in the minibar? I do. And which TV-channels you can't watch? Watch out. Where are you sleeping, daddy? In this one. I'll sleep tight in this. There. Are you good? We don't need any hotels. - No, this has more soul. - Yeah... Yeah, it actually does. Dear Kristian. Thank you for the good years. Best of luck in Stavanger. From the gang. TSUNAMI DANGER ZONE IN CASE OF TSUNAMI - GET TO HIGHER GROUND SHELTER I was an idiot today. Sorry. - Man, these beds suck! - Yeah. Sad that it had to end this way. With Kristian, I mean. You think he'll stay in the oil business for long? We'll see. I guess he'll be back after a year. These mountains. When they first grab you, they never let go. - What the fuck, Arvid? - I read it in a book. I guess you did. Hurtigruten means something for the people along the coast. It's an incredibly beautiful journey. Some call it the world's most beautiful journey on the sea... - Hi - Hi Hello? Mikal? Fuck! Shit! - Margot - Yes? - Arvid? - Jacob? Hello? Can you hear me? - Arvid? - Answering. We're getting some weird readings here. It looks like the mountain has contracted. - That's not possible. - Multiple sensors are showing contraction. Re-calibrate the entire line and read them again. Okay. - Ready for an evening walk? - Of course. - We're going down to take a look. - Now? Yeah, so we can check it out. Almost down. Hello? Yeah, hey there. - Yeah, wait a little. - It's Kristian. - Hey, are you longing back here already? - No, no, we're leaving tomorrow. - Everything all right up there? - Yeah, everything's fine. Just a few sensors that are acting weird. They're showing contractions in the mountain. Contractions? Yeah, but there's probably some mistake somewhere. Arvid and Jacob are down there now checking it out, so we'll know pretty soon. - Okay. - Hey, I'll keep you posted. - Thanks. I'll talk to you later. Bye. - Bye. What the fuck was that?! The geophones are reading quakes over there. Yeah, we felt it here too. Minus 0.8 more at C6. Can I get data for C6? 1.72. Minus 2.6 the last hour. Fucking hell! Same here. Confirming contraction. Want us to check number 7 as well? - Yeah, I'll do it. - Fuck this. Are Arvid and Jacob still down there? Yeah, they just confirmed the data. Listen to me. Get them out of there, right now! - What do you mean? - Let me talk to Arvid. - Arvid? - Answering. - Wait a little. - There, Kristian. - Arvid? Arvid, can you hear me? Hello? - Kristian? - Get the hell out of there. - Drop all you have and get out. - We're just gonna finish up here. I've checked the data from Vajont and Randa. There were registered contractions right before the avalanches. Same thing at both places. Arvid, they weren't expanding. They were contracting. We're coming up. - What was that? What's going on? - Jacob is stuck! - Take it easy, I'll get you out. - What's going on? Arvid? Jacob's foot is stuck. I'll get you out, it'll be fine. - What are the sensors saying? - Wait a little. Groundwater is sinking. At several spots. I'm losing contact with them. Jacob, everything will be okay. - Margot? Sound the alarm. - But... Code Red! Code Red! Margot, sound the alarm! - What the fuck are you doing? - It won't hold both of us. Arvid! Arvid! - Hello? Margot? - Daddy, what's going on? Hey, what's going on? Ten... Ten minutes. We have ten minutes. We need to get the guests out of here! - Get the bus driver! - Got it! Come on! In, get in. Seat belt on. For God's sake, please answer! Welcome to voice-mail... Wake up! Everybody wake up! Come on! Get out! Everybody out of the hotel! Everyone has to get out! Everyone has to get out!

Are you okay? What do I do? The person you are calling can not be reached. Really? Yeah, there's a lot of people who don't have service up here. Excuse me, can I just... - Where are those you are talking to? - In the mountainside above Geiranger. There's a lot by the cabins up there. - Could I please borrow it for a second? - Yeah. Hello? Hi. I'm wondering... There was a tourist bus supposed to leave the hotel... There's no bus up there with you now? You're certain? Thanks. - Hey. - Where are mommy and Sondre? - Daddy is going to find them now. - But I don't want you to leave. I understand. But mommy is really worried about us right now. I have to find her and tell her that we are fine. - Am I going to be here by myself? - No, you won't be alone. You'll be with Teresa and Thomas. You know what I think? Thomas would be very happy if you could help him look after Teresa. Think you can do that? You're a brave little girl. And so beautiful. Okay, then you'll stay here. - And I'll go get mommy. - And Sondre. And Sondre, of course. Okay. There we go. Okay. I need to get out of here. The door, Sondre. Wait! There. And push! Come on! Give me the light. Help me up. Take off your jacket. Take off your jacket! - No, fuck this! - Come on! - This is pointless! - Would you rather be out there? Easy. We'll wait until the water has risen above the door. The pressure will be lower and we can try again. If we wait down here any longer then we're as good as dead! Fuck! We can't wait down here. If we do, we're dead! Hello! Hello! Hello? Idun? Sondre? Let's try now. Get to the hatch. Phillip, are you alright? Grab the ceiling. Look, you can grab on here. - Take it easy. - Don't touch me!

Listen to me. The water down here is rising. Soon there won't be any air left. Then we're both dead. And I can't allow that! Me and mom need you. and Julia needs you. Look at me. We all need you. Okay? I'll swim first and you'll come right behind me. I'll look after you the entire time. Are you ready? Okay, let's do this. One. Two. Three. Sondre! - Where's dad? - He was right behind me. Kristian? No. No, no way in hell. Dad! Dad, please! Come on! Dad! Mommy! THE CRACKS IN KERNESE ARE UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE. THEY EXPAND ABOUT 15 CENTIMETERS PER YEAR.
