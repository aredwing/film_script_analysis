So I work outside the box to help my clients open up. - I quit! - No. I want couples to understand that behind every strong relationship is courage, and it's always worth the fight. I think you've reached a new level of emotional intimacy, but don't forget to do your homework, okay? - You've got to practice to create new habits. - (TELEPHONE RINGING) - Good night, Annie. - Good night. (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) DARCY ON PHONE: Annie, I know you're there. I have tickets to the Citizens for a Better Colorado benefit and it's tonight. It's a big event and Joe can't come and I don't want to go alone. Please come. I haven't seen you in ages. By the way, I have new baby pictures. Gotcha! (WHISTLE BLOWING) MAN: Get low, get low, get low. Let's go. Let's go. Nice pass, Kenny. Nice. Wazzy! Go! Yo! Yeah! Tom Brady, eat your heart out! Kenny, stop horsing around and focus! Come on. Let's get to work! We've got Madeira next week! Go down, Kenny. Work on those post patterns. Dad, I need to get home. I have homework. What's wrong, sweetheart? Huh? Last night I had another dream about Mom. MARK: Zoe! Zoe! Kenny! Kenny! Come on. We're going to be late! KENNY: I don't want to go. It's educational. KENNY: (LAUGHS) Exactly! That's why I don't want to go! Would you go get him and tell him we have to go? Now. Touchdown! That's what I'm talking about. Neanderthal! Turn off the football, we're going now! Stop! Stop! Come on! You're freaking out my brain waves! We're going. (KENNY GROANS) Tuck your shirt in. Dad, you know how much I hate these events. Listen to me, I'm desperate to raise money for this program. Having you guys here with me makes me look good. Now come on. Dad, how many of these events have we been to in the past two months? Six or seven. Why? And you've struck out all seven? Your point? Kenny was with us every time. Maybe with a family of two, you'd have more luck. (KENNY MOCKING) - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Chill. - Okay. All right. Okay. (INDISTINCT) So, if I can raise $250,000 privately, the city will provide a matching grant to make up the difference. That's a lot of money, Mr. Crane. Have you read the statistics on latchkey kids? They drop out of school, hang with the wrong crowds, get into trouble, you name it. My dad's after-school program is about helping society. He's looking at the big picture. This is my daughter Zoe, our unofficial spokesperson. This is my son Kenny. - The strong, silent type. - Hi. All right, well, it looks like I'll be working for you in a few years. Yeah. Probably all of us, really, right? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't get lost. Okay. Nice job. - Look, I realize it's an awful lot of money. - It is. With the economy, there's just a lot of belt tightening going on right now, you know? My son's right, Mr. Crane. Can our corporation's limited charitable funds be best spent on your program? That's the question. Alexander Bishop. I remember watching you play for the Broncos. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bishop. They'll let anybody into this party, won't they? Well, the fact that you're here certainly proves that. - Hi, Brenda. - Hello. Brenda and Kurt Warner. Alexander Bishop and his son Jake. - How you doing, Jake? - Hi. - It's good to meet you. - It's a pleasure. You guys got to watch out for this guy. He once hit me so hard, it took me two days to remember if I was in Denver or St. Louis. ALEXANDER: I saw that game. That was right before you blew out your knee, right? That was the career ender, then I got into something a little more satisfying. And I understand you have too, Kurt. Yeah. We're working a lot with our First Things First foundation. - You still got my number? - Yeah. All right. Give me a call sometime. We'll catch up. - I will. See you, Kurt. - Very nice to meet you guys. Good guy. MAN: This Tyrannosaurus rex is one of the largest land carnivores of all time. Measuring up to 42 feet in length, 13 feet tall at the hips and seven tons in weight... Check out the babeasaurus. You know, I bet she really likes football players. Come on. Really? ...with teeth that could crush bone like bananas. All I'm saying is if you can save my marriage, you can save anybody's. Finish your book. I know. I should. I just can't seem to get the structure. Let me help. Chapter 1. "Darcy gets married and he is not perfect. " Chapter 2. "Annie shows Darcy that she's not exactly perfect either. " By the way, that was pure genius on your part. Chapter 3. "Darcy and husband work on their problems, "truly fall deeply in love and have a beautiful child together. " That last chapter title is a little too long, isn't it? So my book is gonna be all about your marriage? Not all of it. I'm just saying some of your clients would be embarrassed to reveal details of their lives. I'm not that person. I reveal everything. I think it could get both of us a lot of attention. Could be a potential donor for my food bank program. Wish me luck. I'm off to pan for gold. Okay. No. Wait. Give me the pictures. It's how you got me here. - (GASPING) Oh! - Muah! Aw! We can't go in there. Relax. We're just acquisitive young minds. Okay, it's "inquisitive," and you don't have a mind like that. Kenny, get out of there. Dad will kill you. (KENNY SCREAMS PLAYFULLY) Sheesh! That egg could feed the whole football team. MARK: Hey! You break it, you not only have to buy it, you have to eat it. - Now, get out of there. - How is it going up there, Dad? - Get out of there. - Sorry. Okay. You hiding from T. rex? If I were still a kid, I could definitely see a nightmare coming. Can you see that woman across the room wearing the red dress? (INDISTINCT) - ANNIE: She's beautiful. - Inside and out. I'm a lucky man, and I knew it from the moment I saw her. - Not many men could say that. - That's true. If you don't mind, tell me the second she looks this way. (INDISTINCT) And I'm covering for you because? Well, I promised her I wouldn't take this out the entire evening. I'm faithful in the big things, but this is business. And you've never used your cell phone as an excuse to avoid talking to her? No. Never. Absolutely not. Okay. Well, let's use technology as a way to enhance your relationship with your wife. Text her right now. Tell her she's the most beautiful woman in the room. Are you kidding? Trust me on this. Type. You're the most beautiful woman in the room. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Did you ever think of doing this for a living? I already do. Excuse me. Excuse me. University of Colorado, right? - I'm Mark... - Crane. Yeah. You're Annie Morgan, right? The Annie Morgan. The? You tutored me, remember? You were a freshman, I was a senior? Right. You needed a lot of help. Just a dumb jock trying to keep his GPA up to stay eligible to play. That's me. - Hi, sweetie. - Bish, you're so sweet. - Who told you to do that? - That's my secret. - Are you here alone? - Yeah. I mean, no. Oh, hey, guys, come here. I want you to meet somebody. - Old friend. Annie Morgan. - Hi. - This is Kenny and Zoe, my children. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Annie Morgan. We went to college together. She tutored me. - Very cool. - Can I get a photo of your lovely family? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. PHOTOGRAPHER: Right up against the bones. - Come on. - (STAMMERING) Go ahead, go. There she is. That's the young woman I was telling you about. SOPHIA: What a beautiful family. ALEXANDER: Yeah. She obviously knows what she's talking about. - Do you think she could help? - Well... - Thank you. - Excellent. Thank you. - Thanks. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be in the way. Oh, come on. - Bye. - Bye. Nice to meet you. - Bye. - Hey, hey. Don't go too far - because we're leaving soon. - Okay. Well, I better, um, you know... It was great seeing you. Yeah. It was great seeing you, too. Hey, you know, you haven't changed a bit. In fact, I would say you look better, if that's possible. Thank you. Are you cold? I could be. - Yes. Yes. Definitely. - Come on. Where's your husband? I'd love to meet him. Oh, I'm not married. Oh. Uh, so, what're you doing now? Ironically, I'm a marriage and family counselor here in Denver. I know. Single marriage counselor. - Yeah. - Is your wife here? 'Cause I'm running a special. Oh. No, I'm not married. My wife passed away about three years ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Thanks. You know, it's been an adjustment, but... I mean, it's been roughest on my little one, really. It's been rough on all of us, actually, but... Uh... Anyway, I should... I gotta go round them up. We better get going. Yeah. It was great to see you. You too. - Hey. - Struck out again. Whose coat? Oh! Mark's coat. I better go find him. Return it to him tomorrow. I want to go home. (PHONE RINGING) (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Hi, this is Mark. You've reached my cell. You know what to do. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (SQUAWKING) - Hello? - ALEXANDER: Yes, is this Annie Morgan? - Uh, yes. - Last night at the museum, I showed you the most beautiful woman in the world. Oh. The guy with the cell phone issues. I was so impressed that I decided to interview you. To interview me? I'm looking for a new host for a radio show. Denver might need what you have to offer. Great, and you're going to make that happen? Run a search on Alexander J. Bishop. I take it from the silence on your end that you're looking at my mug shot. (STUTTERS) Yeah, I didn't... I mean, I thought that... This is for a real interview? For a show? Absolutely. Well, why don't we meet for lunch or dinner to talk about this? Better idea. You hop on a plane and come out here and spend the weekend with me and my family at my ranch in New Mexico. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll be in touch. (DISCONNECTS) Duke, let's hunt. As long as I'm here, Jack has a place to be while you're at work. And you pay what you can afford when you can afford it, okay? You better get to work. Don't worry. Thank you very much, Mr. Crane. Hey. Yeah, you probably didn't lose any sleep over this. Been so busy, completely forgot it. Thank you. I just heard you with that mom. You're a good guy. Well, I'm only a good guy for another three weeks - until the city shuts us down. - Why? Lost funding for the after-school program. Federal cutbacks. That's what I was doing at the museum last night, hat in hand, looking for an angel with deep pockets. I think I may have talked to my angel this morning. Oh, really? What happened? I met this man at the museum, helped him out of a tough spot with his wife and... (CELL PHONE RINGING) Go ahead. - Hello. - JAKE: Annie, hi. This is Jake Bishop, Vice President, Bishop Communications. I hear you got the early call from my dad this morning. Oh, yeah, right. Listen, I'm calling to confirm this weekend, and to get your contact information before messengering over those plane tickets. Oh! It's just me, one is fine. It doesn't work that way with my dad, Annie. When he's considering hiring someone, he's hiring their entire family. My entire what? Your husband Mark and the two kids. Your family made a big impression on my dad and mom, Annie. You should know that. Family is big in our business. Can I call you right back? I'll be waiting. Everything okay? Jake Bishop? Hey, I spoke to him last night. He and his father. Was trying to get him to help with my funding. Mr. Bishop is thinking of putting me on one of his radio stations. Wow! That's good, huh? But he thinks I'm married. To you. (LAUGHS) Why would he think that? Well, he must have seen us together. - With your children. - The picture. So, call him back now. Straighten it out. - Right. - Always best to do it right away. I just think there's something bigger going on here. I mean, I want to save marriages, and you want to save children. So? So, wouldn't you like another shot at pitching your program to Mr. Bishop? Yeah. And I'd really like that newjob so I can reach out to families who can't afford therapy. But you're not married. But I could be. We could be to each other for the weekend? KENNY: So why are we coming here? To tell some rich guy who thinks you two are married that you're not? Why didn't you just call this Bishop guy and tell him the truth? Because Annie can't get the job unless she has face time with this guy and his family. And your dad gets another shot at pitching the after-school program. You can probably make a ton of money having your own show. It's not about the money, it's a career choice. (SCOFFS) KENNY: Have you figured out how you're going to pull this off yet? 'Cause I'd kind of like to go home. ANNIE: We'll find a moment alone with Mr. Bishop, explain the misunderstanding. MARK: And by the time our heads hit the pillow tonight, this will all be behind us. I want to move on KEQA in Portland. It's underutilized. I thought we'd been through this. I don't think this is a good move. For you or for me, Dad? The company can't afford the stress of a new acquisition. Credit is tight. You know that. (CAR HONKING) JAKE: Here they are. KENNY: Whoa! ZOE: Whoa! I'd be careful when I give this guy the bad news. For once, I agree with my brother. All right. Okay, come on, you guys. Let's go. - Howdy. - ALEXANDER: Welcome. I'm so glad you could come. If this is your first time to this part of New Mexico, you're in for a treat. - Mr. Bishop. - Please, call me Bish. These are our children, Kenny and Zoe. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. Hi, Kenny, Zoe. Jake, you remember Mark. Yes, I do. It's good to see you. This is Annie Morgan who has solid broadcast potential. Wow, I don't know what to say. (LAUGHING) That's not good for someone who might be hosting a radio show. Right, well, maybe you and I could have a few minutes to talk now? - Privately? - We got a whole weekend to talk. Don't worry about your luggage. I'll send somebody for it, okay? Come on, I'll show you inside. I want you to meet my daughter Eliza. I saw the panels as we were driving in. You have solar out here? Absolutely. New Mexico is perfect for it. Three hundred and twenty-five days of sunshine. I did a paper on solar energy for my science class. I'll tell you what, Zoe. Everything I do out here is about preserving the land. - See those barrels over there? - Yeah. We collect the rainwater and filter it, and we do a lot of little things, like wash our clothes in cold water, we use rechargeable batteries. We don't waste anything. You take care of the land, the land takes care of you. Now come on, let's scoot inside. Please, come in. Sophia? We've got company. Ah! There she is, the girl who stole my heart and still does. - This is Annie and Mark. - Mark, how are you? Pleasure. What a beautiful home you have. - Thank you so much. Hello, Annie. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you so much for having us. - The pleasure is all mine. And this is Lucia, our daughter-in-law. Emphasis on the "daughter" part. You've been the talk of the house all morning and nobody even knows who you are. And we're gonna change all that. These must be your lovely children. Oh. Yes. This is Kenny and Zoe. - Hi. - Hello. I love having kids on the ranch. - Keeps me young. - Yeah. Bish is the youngest guy I know. Good luck keeping up with him. ALEXANDER: Why don't you kids track down my granddaughter Eliza? - This place is out of control. - This is amazing. KENNY: This guy Bishop must be really loaded. - (HORSE WHINNIES) - ZOE: I hear horses. KENNY: Whoa! - The door's unlocked. Come on. Let's go. - Don't push me. Who's that? Good boy. She's out of your league. That's impossible. Okay, what are we gonna do? Because we can't sleep in here together. We have to. I'll sleep on the floor. Don't worry, I don't snore. Don't you have any regular old socks? My mother bought these socks for me, and these underwear. Your mother still buys your socks and underwear for you? - Oh! This is a bad sign. - Why is that a bad sign? Well, it's a bad sign because it means you can't make basic personal decisions, like, how come you didn't stop me from doing this? Because this guy Bishop can single-handedly save my kids' program and give you an entirely new career opportunity. And if that's selfish, then shoot me. (SIGHS) Mark, these are decent people and we're deceiving them. And what kind of signal is this sending your children? Don't you mean our children? At least until we tell them the truth. Okay, let's talk about where you're sleeping again. - Hi. - Hi. You're really good. Thanks. Did you wanna go for a ride? We can take him back out, he's really gentle. Uh... Yeah, that's okay, maybe later. Are you into sports like your dad? Yeah, football, basketball, baseball. I don't know, I like being on a team. - How about you? - Volleyball. It gets me out of the house and away from everything that's going on. My name's Eliza. (WHINNYING) - And this is Trey. - (BOTH LAUGH) - Kenny. - I have to rub him down. - Do you want to give me a hand? - Yeah, yeah. Okay, come on. And when I wrote him back, I said it was a bad idea. (CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Well? I just met the girl of my dreams. You say that after every girl you meet. This girl is different. You say that, too. Ah! She's just... Wow. I... You're so articulate when you fall in love. Well, she's almost as cute as my sister. All right, guys, listen up. Annie and I have discussed it and Annie feels it's best if we tell the truth sooner than later. ANNIE: I just can't put this off. Your dad and I are gonna tell Mr. Bishop everything and then we can all just go home. No, no. You know, wait. I'm against this whole telling the truth thing right now. What are you talking about? You wanted to leave before we even got here. Dad, when was the last time you got to commune with nature? Huh? You know, forget nature, the universe. The whole universe is right here. I mean, think of the stars at night, huh? Breathing this fresh air. You know, meeting the locals. - What's going on? - It's a girl. - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - SOPHIA: Lunchtime, everybody. I'm sorry, I just can't live with myself if I don't say something. I hope everyone is hungry. I love to cook. ALEXANDER: Which is why I have to run five miles a day to stay even. - You run five miles a day? - Or more. - You a runner? - Yeah, I run. If you think you can keep up, we'll have to go out sometime. Don't worry, I won't have any problem keeping up. (LAUGHS) You're a competitor, I like that. That's one of the reasons you're here. My guess, if you counsel a couple and things don't work out, you take that as a personal failure. I don't like to lose. I don't like to see couples lose or their children. My parents gave up on their marriage, so, for me, keeping families together is personal. We're on the same page. Before this goes any further, there's something you should know. (COUGHING) Um... Me and my sister, we'd love to make a toast to our parents. Right, Zoe? Um... What you guys do for others is just... - Awesome. - Thank you. Easy. (ALEXANDER CHUCKLES) To have your kids look up to you, that's what it's all about, isn't it? To a memorable weekend! ALL: Cheers! MARK: Honestly, I don't know what you guys were thinking. Dad, we did it for you, okay? We know how much the program means to you. I know you meant well, but, I mean, this just really complicates everything now. - We're sorry. - Yeah, we're sorry. Well, your dad's right, the longer we wait to tell the truth, the worse it will be for all of us. Aim slightly off center to get a good break. Sweet. (GUN SHOTS) He knows! Are you kidding me? What, he's gonna shoot us? Come on, move it! Let's go! Let's go! - MARK: What do we do now? - You're the ex-football player. Save us! Oh, great. Dad didn't tell you, did he? - ANNIE: No. Tell us what? - Where is everybody? Nobody stays at the Bishop ranch for free. When you come here, you work. And today we're mending fences. Oh! I thought we were gonna die. All right, so, jeans, boots. Dress warm, you guys. We got some snow in the high country last night. All right? Everything's in your rooms. Meet outside in 10. ALEXANDER: Let's go, let's go! Come on! (FIRING GUN) (SIGHS) We could have built the Great Wall of China by now. - What's my horse's name? - Dollar. After John Wayne's horse in True Grit Where is that wife of yours? You know women, Bish. Get rid of those shoes. This is the Wild West! You look ridiculous! Sorry, but the boots didn't fit. - Bish. - You'll spook the horses. Oh! Ignore General Custer. You look darling. Come on, mount up. We're headed for the high country. - Here you go. - Oh. Oh, brother. Horses aren't my thing. I took one for the team this morning. I got on that plane. I don't like flying. - It's your turn. - Really? You didn't tell me on the flight. 'Cause I was talking myself out of a panic attack. If you're not comfortable on a horse, why don't you get in the ATV with Sophia? Thank you. Are we finally ready? Now, we don't come back until all the fences are fixed and the cows come home. That's it? All of this for cows? 'Cause I thought the world was coming to an end. (CHUCKLES) Son, if you're a cow out in the cold, lost, no food for days and coyotes circling you, waiting to rip your guts out and kill you, that is the end of the world. Ugh! Come on, boy, let's go. Come on. Oh, it's so beautiful. Do you live here year round? No, I couldn't take it. Too isolated for me. The ranch has been in Bish's family for about 100 years. Truthfully, I think Bish should have been born 100 years ago. (BOTH CHUCKLE) But then he wouldn't have met you. So tell me what it was like the very first time you saw Mark. Oh. Well, University of Colorado. I was a freshman on scholarship. As part of my work study, I had to tutor athletes. Mmm-hmm. He was one of those jock types that had great instincts on the football field, but couldn't pass math if his life depended on it. He had this great smile and charm about him. He was a senior. He was a star, but he was humble, he didn't act like it. Yeah, every girl in school wanted to get him. But you were the lucky one. So, tell me, where did you get married? Married? We were poor. Oh. Mmm-hmm. We eloped. Just took off. Two college kids in a van. And having no idea what we were doing or where we were going... You know, I think I'm ready to try riding again. Bish! Annie's ready to cowboy up. That's great, just as soon as we fix this fence. Here you go, Annie. You gonna ride around, cowgirl? - I just told Sophia we eloped. - Oh, good one. I know, I'm sorry. We're in this even deeper. We have to tell them. I... Let's think about it. Hold it straight, Lucia. - ALEXANDER: Thank you. - Oh, sweet. Thank you. Jake still has it in his head to run a station of his own. Dad, he should. He has creative ideas and he wants to try them out. Why can't he be creative in Denver? And what's so awful about working with his father and eventually taking over the company? - Truth? - Always. Sometimes the entrepreneur in you gets mixed up with the dad part. Here. Hold this, will you? So how many acres do you have? About 25,000. My great grandfather left everyone he knew in Virginia and came here and fought for this land. It's been in our family ever since. Who did he have to fight? Whoever got in his way. (COWS MOOING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello. (INSTINCT) Sometimes I wish the stupid cell phone towers would just explode. Why would you want that? So my parents would actually talk to each other. So, what do you do out here? You ride, camp, hike. I can't wait to show you Grandpa's swimming pool. There's not a mall anywhere. (CHUCKLES) Out here, I have everything that I need. So where did you and Jake meet? Museum of Natural History in New York. Jake was getting his MBA at Columbia. I think I saw him a half dozen times before he got up the nerve to talk to me. - Shy? - Selfless. I liked that. He had big ideas, dreams for the future. But sometimes he isn't ambitious enough for his own good. Excuse me. Okay, Zoe. I'll hold it, you nail that side. Hit it hard. - (ZOE GRUNTING) - There! Ah-ha! There you go! All right! - (LAUGHING) - (ZOE PANTING) Give me that. You're taking forever. I talked to my dad, okay? I told him I wanted to take over the Portland station. You've been telling him that for the last year and he tells you the same thing, no. Did you tell him you are going to take over the Portland station with or without his help? - Give me the hammer. - Here. - (LAUGHING) - Give me the hammer. Dad's acting weird. Yeah? Looks like he really likes her. All right. Here you go. - SOPHIA: Hot chocolate, kids? - Oh! Thank you. - Hey. - Thanks. Would I look absolutely ridiculous if I went a little pink? - You'd do that? - Sure. I love to shake things up with Bish. He loves surprises. I'm in. I'll help you. - (SIGHS) I'm exhausted. - Yeah, me too. - Harder than it looks, huh? - Yeah. Mr. Bishop, can we take a break? You play football? - Yes, sir. - All right. Let's go! (EXCITED CLAMORING) Go! - Touchdown! High five. - Yeah! Mmm! Oh! (CHEERING) Don't give me a break, okay? I can handle it. Oh! - What's the matter? Can't take a hit? - Easy, tiger. Good hit, Mom! I like what I'm seeing! Take down the old guy. - Hey, can we, like, race back to the ranch? - Okay. Hey, where are they going? (COWS MOOING) MARK: I gotta talk to Zoe. She can't behave this way. ANNIE: I'd give her some time. Eliza has some fun in store, I'm sure. Zoe needs that. Yeah, but she just reacts so emotionally sometimes, you know? Well, I don't blame her. I mean, she's having a difficult time. Look, Mark, you've got to love her and be patient. Patience is everything. She's 13, she's going through changes, she's on a roller coaster, she lost her mother... It's important that you see things from her point of view. I know, you're right. I read the books on how to be a better father, I'm talking to the other dads, it's just... Everything okay? Yeah, I was just talking to Annie, changing my shirt. We need to talk. Right after I leave Annie in the dust. You know how to shoot a gun? So, you think you can handle the pressure of your own radio show? - No problem. - Good. 'Cause you belong on the radio. But it's like being an athlete, you get tested every day and some people fold like a house of cards. You don't like losing, do you? (ALEXANDER LAUGHS) I hate losing. Why do you think I'm successful? Not because I'm the smartest guy in the world, but because I'm the guy who never gives up. I know the feeling. So what was your sport in college? Cross country. Cross country? Oh! ELIZA: For you. Here you go. Race you to the cliffs! Okay. Let's go! Winner! ELIZA: Here it is. What is it? Abandoned dwellings of ancient civilizations. Really? Can we go there? It's spooky. Especially in the dark. - Well, I don't scare easy. - (SCOFFS) That is so not true. Every time there's a thunderstorm, he wants to sleep on the floor in my room. I don't know where she gets it from. And scary movies? You're afraid of scary movies? Okay, let's go. It's gonna get dark. Stay close. MARK: Pull! (GUN FIRES) - Nice shot. - Thanks. Went hunting a lot as a kid with my dad. Pull, pull. (FIRES TWICE) Impressive. No, practice. So how'd you first meet Annie? I met her in college. She worked in the tutoring lab. And I happened to be walking by one day and she was standing in the window. And she was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. So I went in, found out she was a math tutor, so I got her to teach me math. Even though math was my best subject. (LAUGHING) And? The rest is history, I guess. Pull! (CELL PHONE RINGING) Excuse me. Bishop. What? We fixed fences all afternoon. Where? (SIGHS) Okay, Danny, I'm on it, I'm on it. - Problem? - We're gonna have to wrap this up. More down fences, this time on the north side. Cows all over my neighbor's property. He's a rock and roll rancher. You know, all hat, no horse. ANNIE: Lucy and Bishop seem to get along very well. Lucy can't understand why Jake seems satisfied to live in the shadow of his father. - Even though he loves his father. - That's true. Did you and Mark ever have a hard time? Oh. Yeah, of course, everybody does. - Oh, his mother. - Oh. The mother-in-law. It drove me crazy that she bought his underwear. She bought his underwear? Yeah. Still does. - Here you go. - Oh. Thank you so much. My pleasure. I don't think I've ever seen a couple look at each other the way you and Mark do. It's like you just met. Well, I think that's the key, keeping the marriage fresh. What's interesting about you and Mark is that even though you act like newlyweds, neither one of you wears a wedding ring. Hi, honey! - Hi, sweetheart. I missed you. - Hey. - Excuse me. - Sure. I can't take it anymore. Lucy pointed out we're not wearing wedding rings. - Who doesn't wear wedding rings? - Lots of people. But I'm a marriage counselor. I know how lies erode relationships. The game is over. I can't stand it, I can't live with myself anymore. - ALEXANDER: Mark! - I'm telling him now. No, no, no. Wait, listen to me. He wants to talk to me about my program. Just let me have the talk. Okay? The kids need it. Please? We've come this far. Okay, but do it now. Don't put it off. - I promise. - Annie! Want to ride along with us? Oh. No, thanks, I'm gonna help Sophia in the kitchen. We riding a horse? Son, we're talking about 425 horses. Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Hey, let's take the horses! It's too far! This will be fun! I'll show you a few tricks I've learned. And then we can talk about your funding. You really know how to fly this, right? Eight hundred combat missions over Nam. I've been shot at, shot down, survived death at every turn. Now get in! Buckle up. You never know what could happen. But if something goes wrong up there, at least we'll go out in style. Got your insurance paid up? (LAUGHS) MARK: Listen, Mr. Bishop, I... ALEXANDER: (LAUGHING) Whoo! MARK: I'm not comfortable up here. I wanna go back... - ALEXANDER: Watch this. Watch this. - Okay, all right, okay. ALEXANDER: Whoo-hoo! (ALEXANDER LAUGHING) - MARK: Don't do that again. - No, no, watch this. Whoo-hoo! MARK: All right, listen... Listen to me... What's Bishop doing up there? He's such a little kid. He's just showing off. ALEXANDER: Watch this, watch this. Stall out. MARK: You can't stall a helicopter, sir! Stop this! Now, please. ALEXANDER: Whoo-hoo! MARK: All right. Okay. Listen. Listen, this isn't fun. All right? Stop, seriously. ALEXANDER: Whee! MARK: Seriously, sir, take me back now. I'm not laughing. ALEXANDER: I thought you used to play pro football. This looks really bad for the NFL to have an ex-football player panic up in the skies. Son, you need to learn to cowboy up! I've gotta round up those cows. Sorry, Bish. Mark! Mark. Annie, I tried to tell him, I swear to you I did. I know. I know. The man's crazy. You know, the whole time up there, I'm thinking I'm gonna die in the middle of this lie and I'm gonna leave you to clean up the mess. He did a loop-de-loop. Really? A loop-de-loop? A loop-de-loop, in a helicopter! Well, that actually sounds kind of fun. Look, I gotta tell you something. That night, after the party? When I got home, I tried to call you, at midnight. It went right to the answering machine, so I kind of figured you must be... No, no... At midnight? - I was calling you. - No, you weren't. - Really? - Yeah. I just... I was thinking, I... I really wanted to see you again. You know, I don't feel so good. Oh. It's okay, I'm here with you now. - This place is so creepy. - No, it's not. (FLUTTERING) What was that? It's like this every time I come up here. - You're being tested. - Tested? To see if you're afraid. Who lived here? Anasazis. Native Americans. They moved to the valley over 1,000 years ago. Some of the cliff dwellings even have over 200 rooms. That's a whole civilization. - Just think, an entire city. - So what happened to them? They disappeared. Nobody really knows why. Climate change, war. Maybe it's time to get out of here, huh? No, I like it here. I can relate to all this. This is one of the coolest places on the planet. You are so lucky. (HOWLING) (SHUSHING) What? Some say that a few Anasazis still roam these parts, protecting their land. - Let's go. Come on. - No! Come on, let's go. There's nothing here but a bunch of old rocks, Zoe. - Come on, Zoe, let's go! I'm serious. - No! It's cool. - (SCREECHING) - (SCREAMING) (GIRLS LAUGHING) - Come on, let's go, seriously. - No. Oh, no. Come on. KENNY: Bats! Bats! Bats! (ALL SCREAMING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (INDISTINCT) Why would a married man change his shirt in the hallway, while his wife is putting her sneakers on in the bedroom? Neither one of them wears a wedding ring. It's curious. - How's your stomach? - It's getting better. Thanks. So how did you and Danielle meet? We met in a Laundromat, after you had transferred to UCLA. How'd you know I left? I asked the guy who ran the tutor lab, "So, where is she?" So why did you leave? My parents were going through a messy divorce. I needed to be with them. Must have been tough. Yeah, well, it must have been tougher for you. How did Danielle... Kenny and I were at a basketball game. Zoe was at home with her mom when she collapsed. Zoe called 911. But by the time the paramedics got there, she had passed. Zoe was all alone. I'm so sorry. - Hey! How was it? - KENNY: Oh, it was amazing. - Hey, honey. - I might take up archeology in college. Zoe, come sit, tell us about it. Maybe later, I have videos of Kenny for Facebook. KENNY: You wouldn't! Come on, you don't even have any friends on Facebook. Leave me alone! Stop it! Leave me alone! What's everyone's problem? (SIGHS) (HORSE WHINNIES) Hey there, Jack Frost. You look lonely. I think most people think that animals can't get their feelings hurt, but I think they're wrong. Hey. You've got a little company, huh? You got a second for me? Sweetheart, I want you to understand. I like spending time with Annie, she's a lot of fun. But nothing, nothing is going to happen. Dad, I'm not stupid. It's already happened. - What are you talking about? - The way you look at her. - How do I look at her? - Like Kenny looks at Eliza. That's bad. Do you even think about Mom? Every day, every hour. Honey, nobody's gonna replace your mom. Nobody could. Dad, what are we gonna do? Whoo! You know, I've looked at your business plan for your program and I have one question. Why don't you give yourself a bigger salary? Mr. Bishop, I want as much of the money as I can get to go in to the program for the kids. Well, I tell you, I'm thinking seriously about funding your program. And now I need to talk to Annie. Hey, guys, be safe, all right? I'll be back in a while. - Okay. - Yeah! Later. (ZOE EXCLAIMS) You guys really get along, don't you? He adores me. And your mom and dad get along, too. You're such a great family. Yeah, well, your parents are pretty cool, too. Thanks. - Can I ask you a favor? - Yeah, of course. Your mom being a marriage counselor and all, you think you could ask her to talk to my parents? Sure. Yeah, no, yeah. She'd do that. Okay. Come on, let's go get changed. - What do you think you're doing? - Well, you know, helping Eliza. Let her parents find their own marriage counselor. What's wrong with you? You know, you're so selfish. It's not always about you, Zo. Annie, I thought you might be interested in this. It's a town. I mean, you've got a whole town. And not any town, but a real western town. You know where I met Sophia? At the movies. We both went to see Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, alone. I'd never seen such a beautiful woman. I asked her out and discovered we shared all kinds of things in common. And we loved Western movies. Robert Redford was her hero. And me, well, I'm a Paul Newman guy. Between the two of us, we watched every Western we could lay our hands on. We just loved cowboy movies. Okay, but this? Well, it's not about the town, it's about Sophia, how I feel about her. Annie, I just didn't want to forget the moment I saw her. There's nothing like it, knowing you're looking at the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. Well... For our 30th, I put all this together. And now, every time I walk into my little town with my wife, I get to re-live that moment. I think you should be the marriage counselor. Look, I'm sure it was the same with you and Mark, right? (BELL DINGING) What does he want now? That bell rings every five minutes. - I think he knows. - Let's find out. - Kenny and Zoe, you kids come over here. - Yes, sir. And you two are in for a big surprise. When Bish and I learned that you two had eloped... I said we've got to fix that. Fix it? - What do you mean? - I mean, we're fixing it, cowboy style. In the early 1800s, the West was a new frontier and when a couple arrived in New Mexico, the land became their life, and out of that came a tradition of couples renewing their vows. Oh. Uh... Mr. Bishop, we don't like to draw attention to ourselves. Annie's right, Mr. Bishop. We kind of cherish the memory of our elopement. Mmm-hmm. Well, I mean, if it's just symbolic. Hands together. And you look at each other. And the vow goes like this: You will feel no cold, for each of you will be warmth to the other. There is no more loneliness, for each of you will be companion to the other. - So now what? - Gunfire? (LAUGHS) You've got to be kidding. You kiss each other. Now that was a kiss! (ALL APPLAUDING) Here you go. Have you guys seen Zoe? Mmm-mmm. Okay, thanks. Annie, let me do that. Come on. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah. So, Jake, Lucy told me one of the things she loved about you most is your lack of ego. She said you never talk about yourself, it's all about her. So, tell me more. Uh, well, I didn't know if I had what it took to make it in the business world. And I had some pretty big shoes to fill. Then I met Lucy and, well, she told me to make this list of all the things that I was good at. And she said over and over again that I could do anything. And she kept telling me that she believed in me. I still believe in you. So, Jake, what was it about Lucy that made you want to spend the rest of your life with her? She told me I would make a great father. MARK: Zoe? - Have you seen Zoe? - No. Dad, she's not upstairs. - No luck out back? - No. Let's just check the barns. - Zoe! - Zo! Zoe! - Zoe! - Zoe! Zoe! Oh, no. The little ATV's missing. - Eliza, you take Kenny. - Got it. Mark, come with me. Come on. She's out there alone, it's not safe. Annie, why don't you wait here and let us know if she comes back? It's getting dark. You need to hurry! You guys check up that way. That way! Zoe! (ZOE SOBBING) (GROANING) Ow! Zoe! (SHIVERING) Zoe! KENNY: It's getting dark. This isn't funny! (HOWLING) Zoe! Zoe! Zoe. Oh, Zoe. Zoe. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened to you? Why did you leave? I just had to get away, okay? I think I hurt my wrist. Oh, yeah. It looks swollen. Okay, don't move it. It'll be okay. They'll find us. Thanks. Zoe, where are you? Zo! Come on! - ANNIE: That's a beautiful brush. - Thanks. It was my mom's. You must miss her so much. It's a terrible thing to lose your mother. Do you still talk about her? Sometimes I talk about it, sometimes I don't. Well, I hope you feel comfortable talking about her to your dad and your friends. You know, you don't have to manage this all by yourself. Most of my friends feel uncomfortable when I bring up my mom. They probably just don't know what to say or how to help. You know what? It might make it easier if you talk about all the happy memories you have with your mom. Tell me, what's one quality you remember the most about her? Oh, that's easy. Her laugh. She was always laughing. She said, "Zoe, always try and find the joy around you. " Her and my dad were always laughing about something. Hey, what is it? (SOBBING) That's why it's so hard with you being around, because my dad laughs with you like he did with my mom. There's no pain like losing someone you love. It takes a lot of courage to allow yourself to be happy again. And it's even harder to let yourself love again. Does that make sense? Sort of. When my mom died, I was holding her hand. She always told me she wanted me to be happy, and Kenny and my dad. And you just never thought that your dad being happy might mean he'd find someone else. Yeah. I feel bad because I want my dad to be happy. (ATV APPROACHING) MARK: Don't worry, honey. It's just a strain. It'll be better before you know it. What's this? Check that out. ANNIE: Bishop built this town for Sophia. KENNY: Wow! This is so cool. (SINGING) Wow! This is unbelievable! Hey! This is too cool. This is your last night! Live it up! (MOUTHING) You wanna dance? (MOUTHING) Danny Gokey. (VOCALIZING) (ALL CHEERING) Listen, everybody, I want you to meet my friend and neighbor, Danny Gokey. Hello. (ALL CHEERING) Hey, Bish, I never got around to thanking you for finally getting your cattle off of my property. ALEXANDER: Well, we couldn't have them disturbing you, could we? Tell you what, Bish. I have a special song called Cfazy Not To that I think you guys might like. All right. (PLAYING MELLOW SONG) (SINGING) Hey, Dad, I need to talk to you. Look, the truth is... Well, since you've said no so many times, I've put private equity financing in place to make a deal on the Portland station. Okay. I want to hire my own people. I've got some ideas that I want to try out. I can do this. Have you thought this through? Yeah, I have. - Well, maybe there's a way... - Dad, I need to do this one on my own. Bish, let's go dance. (HARMONIZING) Man, this is so great. I love it here. And it's all because you guys are pretending to be married and you're not. Thanks. Thanks. Please! Wait. - Stop! - (MUSIC STOPS) Stop! What's going on? The truth, the truth about Mark and me. Mom, Mom, I love you so much. Zoe, I know what you're trying to do, and it's wrong. It's all wrong. I'm sorry, but the truth is Mark and I have been lying to you. We're not married. - You're not married? - You're kidding. No. Mark and I hadn't seen each other since college until last week. We've tried to tell you several times. But I wanted the business opportunity. MARK: I was trying to save my youth program. It was so wrong of us. And I've set a terrible example for my children. You both lied. There's a code I live by that was not honored this weekend. You will not be a part of my programming, and you will not receive funding from me. Truth is everything. (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY) Sorry to complicate your weekend. Yeah, well, you never really know what life is going to throw at you, do you? No. No, you don't. I needed a weekend like this. Something to push me. I needed Annie. You know, your favorite expression is "cowboy up. " That's all I'm doing, Dad. I'm getting on the bull and taking a chance, just trying to hold on for eight seconds. I just want to be like you. Yeah. Yeah. - Son. - Yeah? - Ready? - Ready. What do you think? Awesome, isn't it? (LAUGHS) Yeah, I think that I'm going to have a very good time the next time I have to go to one of those old stuffy museum events. Zoe, you've needed somebody to talk to for a long time. So, you know what? Don't let her go. Thanks. - I'm gonna go say goodbye to Jack Frost. - Okay. Don't forget to e-mail me. - You do e-mail? - Get out of here. I think it's okay to move on. Maybe it's what Mom would have wanted. What do you think? (GIGGLES) Good boy. (CLICKS TONGUE) So, when do you think you'll be moving to Portland? I don't know. Well, if you're still in Denver, would you come to one of my games? Count on it. Annie. Annie. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have deceived you or Bishop, any of you. I know. But you can admit your fault. It's another reason why I like you. And there was a silver lining in your mistake. Jake and Lucy. A corner has been turned. I hope so. (CHOPPING) None of us are too old to change, are we? Kids, we're really sorry we dragged you into all of this. Let this be a lesson to you. Always tell the truth. Even when it's not convenient. ZOE: It's gonna be a long flight home. We really blew it, didn't we? Yep, a lot went on this weekend, huh? Yeah. I mean, it was a pressure situation, you know. When that happens, you just lose all reason and perspective. Yeah. Your emotions get the better of you sometimes, I guess. Yeah, and then you come back down to Earth. Yeah. It's amazing. They're both crazy for each other, but won't admit that they're crazy for each other. Maybe we better get going. Got a lot to do this week. Get the kids home, you know. Yeah. I better get a move on and get back at it. Okay. (SENTIMENTAL SONG PLAYING) (SIGHS) (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (INAUDIBLE) Annie, why am I here? Because I need you here with me. No, wrong. Chapter 13. "Marriage counselor finds the man of her dreams, "but won't admit it. " You need Mark with you. Not me. It's just an infatuation, which is a shallow emotion, something that won't last, something I just need to get over. - You're afraid. - I'm not... You're afraid to take your own advice. The courage to love, you can sure talk about it, but you don't live it. You're gutless. (TAP RUNNING) Zo, what's up with that? He's reaching the breaking point. I'll see you next week, the usual time. Remember, we always talk about having the courage to trust our convictions, but we can't forget about the courage it takes to love. Hi, folks. MAN: Hi. Bishop, would you like to come in? Thank you. "The courage to love"? Where did that come from? Oh, somebody smarter than me wrote it somewhere. There are a lot of smart people in the world, and I'm not always one of them. At least you're honest. Not really, which is why I'm here. I'm afraid I brought you to New Mexico under false pretenses, young lady. (SIGHS) I was hoping you could help save my son's marriage. How are Jake and Lucy? Getting there. Look, I've decided you're just not right for the radio. You made that very clear last week. I don't blame you. Let me finish. You aren't right, you're perfect. What? Sophia told me I would be a fool if I didn't hire you. And we both know Sophia is always right. So, I am offering you your own show on KTRD. But I'm not married. I'm flexible. Oh! I'll work for you on one condition. - Seventeen... - ZOE: Seven... Hey, Charlie, get your nose in that rule book tonight, okay? - No more fouls. I'll see you next week. - KENNY:... nineteen... - All right, guys, let's go. Dinner. - ... and 20. - Where are we going to dinner? - Where do you think? - Burger Barn. - Ew! I'm going vegan. - Annie! - Hi! Annie. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing? - The play clock is ticking down. Hello! Been a long time. Six days, 22 hours and 48 minutes? Seems a little longer to me. Alexander Bishop showed up at my office. - He offered me a job. - He did? Wow. - My own radio show. - That's great. Congratulations. You deserve it. And he offered you the funding for the after-school program. I know. - You know? - Yeah, I just spoke to him. Well, did he tell you the condition? No. We get married. I'm just kidding, that's not part of the plan. (ANNIE LAUGHS) - I call this a game changer. - Definitely. ANNIE: Joe, you play sports? MALE CALLER: Was a linebacker. East High Warriors. Okay, tough guy. So, you took some hits. Yeah, but I got back up. I can take it. - For the team? - For the team, right. (KIDS CHATTERING) Do you have kids? I can hear them. How old? Eight and six. Joe, whether you know it or not, you've got a team. And you may take some hits, but you better have the courage to get up and keep playing. Because the team you're on now is a lot more important than the Warriors. Don't quit. - Was it ever easy, Joe? - No. But it was worth it, right? When you gave it your all. It was the best, wasn't it? Yeah, I don't know... I just don't know. Call back, Joe, let me know you're in the game. Until tomorrow, this is Annie Morgan at KTRD, Denver. Remember, love takes courage. And we're out. - (LAUGHS) You are a hit! - Good show. - You think so? - I know so. The numbers are already coming in. - Hi! - Hey! Ooh! Good job. Amazing. That was awesome! I can't wait to tell my friends. - You were born for this. - Thanks, you guys. Hey, Annie, that last caller? Joe? He called again. - He said he needs to talk to you. - Annie, he can call back tomorrow. - No. I wanna talk to him. - Okay. - Will you wait? I'll be just a minute. - Yeah. Hi, Joe, it's Annie. Yeah, what's going on? (UPBEAT SONG PLAYING) (INAUDIBLE)
