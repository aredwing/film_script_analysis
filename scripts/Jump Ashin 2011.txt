How could you eat the lunchbox during class? Mom, the braised chicken thigh you made smelled so good. What an excuse. If I made fried chicken, then you'd... finish iton the way to school. Mom, can I practice gymnastics? Do we need to pay for that? The coach said no. Then go for la. Straighten your arm, don't push. It hurts. You may go. Next. What are you looking at? It's your turn.

Let's go. Now, I can go back to Yilan. Ashin. Pickle! Pickle! Why didn't you listen to me? You said you'll become the head. You said you'll cover me. Pickle... Any message? A lot. All nasty ones? Right. Forget it. Do you think... I should go back? Why do you like it here so much? Ashin, Why don't you just come back to the gymnastic team? You fight as good as Jackie Chan. That is amazing. You didn't see my defense I'll take you after all Dumb Knight, I'm taking you down Come on, your turn Boss. Here he is. How dare you to come here? I'm here, because I want to solve the problem. Come here. Come closer. You're not afraid of death? Boss, if he is really not afraid of death, we can make his dream come true. We can cut oh' his legs. Or the hands. Cut off his legs, hands... and his dick to feed the crocodile. You guys are really enjoying this, huh? Ashin! How dare you to come here! Dad, let's take him out. Master. Shut up. I know this asshole dealt drugs... behind my back. I also know that... the whole mess was because he beat you in first place. Even so, it's the son of mine that was beaten. I can not bear to lose the face. Let me ask you, why did you come back... when you knew I won't be easy on you? 'Cause I want a new start. I want to go back to gymnastics. Gymnastics? That jumping and rolling thing? You'll lose your hands and legs soon, I would love to see you roll... Shut up. Nice, gymnastics. I will give you a year. You have to win a gold medal... within one year. If not, you won't be bathing in this one... but that one. Hey, assemble here. You're hand-picked gymnasts... since you were kids. Over times, many chose to leave. For those who chose to stay, please respect your own choice, and respect this sport. Ashin. One, two. Higher. One. Hold it. Two. Old man, are you okay? Shut up! Go, sprint! I said sprint! Time to quit smoking. You're not capable of... practicing individual event yet. Get up from there. Go to run on the field first. Boss, He looks exhausted. Let' go. Ashin, I'll kill you this time. Don't go! Go to hell! Where did you put your balls? Why don't you stop and fight? Thank you for giving Ashin a chance. Don't run so fast. Half the reason is of you, the other half is of he himself. He is a really stubborn young man. He's quite like the younger you. Me? Come on. I'm much stronger than he is. Yeah. You were the best among the team. Alas. Strong? So what? You still need to eat and shit. He does want to do gymnastics. Do you think he has prospects? There is an international game at the end of the year. I am not sure if he can make it. You're the coach! You shouldn't say this. Train him seriously. Don't you lose my face. Come on, you're a gang master. How would I dare to lose your face? Fine. Quit it. Look I will not run away anymore Face the calling the blood running deep within my heart. Stay focused. I will not be astray again. Hold my breath, never give up. Slowly, I walk toward my dream. Forget it. Don't mention the mess. Let it go. Focus on one thing only. I'll do my best. Leap as high as the sky. Toward the brightest. I'll breath harder. Fly into another brilliant sky. Perfect. Landing. Ashin Ashin. Come here. Coach. Put your hand here. Touch it. Think of it as a real horse. Stroke its hair. Talk to it: Thank you. We can do this sport... only because of you. Coach, what are you doing? Talking to it. Man gymnastics events are: Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Still Rings Vault, Parallel Bars, Horizontal bar Six in total. They are all performed on cold facilities. If you don't learn to feel them, don't build relationships with them, you can never overcome your fears to them. So, use your imagination. Talk to it. Get it? So you and the coach have stroked... the vault for an entire 10 minutes? Yeah. It is funny, isn't it? No. Does it make you feel better... when thinking it as something alive? Kind of. But my biggest problem... comes from myself. If I don't overcome my left leg, I can never get a good result. Ashin. What? Actually, I envy you because you're a gymnast. Oh yeah? Yes. I was a swimmer. Holy crap! Really? You must look great in swimming suit. Hey, I'm serious. Fine. Do you still swim? Not anymore. Why? Ashin. You must hang on. You fight not only for yourself... but for those who had dreams. One more thing. You have a message from 599. She said: Go for it! I got it. Brother, dad is dying. Mom wants us to go home and change dad's clothes. Dad? Brother, what are you doing? Dad said, if you feel like crying... you can do handstand. So the tears won't fall down. This is it! Add to what is needed. Fill the short one to the right length. Thank you for taking care of Ashin while he's staying here. Never mind. As long as the problems are solved. Ashin... What are you doing here? Why cant you just let me do gymnastics? You want to see me live in hell again? Ashin... Why do you want to deprive me of the chance to have a new life? You want me to sell fruit again? This is my life, not yours. Mrs. Lin... Mrs. Lin... Coach, no matter what my mom said, I will not leave the team this time. Hold the shoes first. The left one has special pad and sole with just the right thickness. So the lengths of your legs... can become even. I thought about this for a long time. It's the only solution to your legs. Thank you, coach. Not me, If there's anyone to thank, it's your mom. Do you know you had Polio? She has been blaming herself for it. She said it's her fault that... led to your illness. Thanks to her massaging your leg everyday since you were a kid, or your left leg would wither... even more seriously than it is now. Do you get it? Don't move. Mom, why are you massaging Brother's leg? The constant massage can make your brother grow up. Here comes the good one. Mom, what's this? Eat legs for better legs. Your game is coming. Frog legs can help you jump higher. Mom... I am not competing, so I don't have to eat. You used to say that... you want to be a grown-up. Eat this so you can be a grown-up. See? I don't want to. Eat it. Don't tease your younger brother. Mom I can't help you Your older brother has been fond of teasing you Dad, please bless me... to get A+ in my test this month, and mom to be healthy, and brother to win the Vault Gold Medal. Don't make so many wishes. Your dad will be exhausted. I'll take care of them. Kill them. Come on, sprint. Sprint! Sprint! Nice!
