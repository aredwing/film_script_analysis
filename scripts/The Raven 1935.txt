The root nerves at the base of the brain... ...something has impinged on them. It's impossible... Stop telling me that! Jerry. Vollin. Dr. Vollin. Can we get Dr. Vollin? Dr. Vollin? Get Dr. Vollin here. "Suddenly there came a tapping... "As of someone gently rapping... "rapping at my chamber door. "Open then I flung the shutter... "when, with many a flirt and flutter... In there stepped a stately Raven" Raven is my talisman. Curious talisman. Bird of the ill omen. A symbol of death. Death is my talisman, Mr. Chapman. The one indestructible force. The one certain thing in an uncertain universe. Death. Uh, Dr. Vollin, the museum that I represent... ...will pay you a very handsome price for your Poe collection. Yes, yes, I know, but will you tell Dr. Vollin... ...this is a matter of life and death? Oh. If you'll hold the line just a moment, sir. What is it? Excuse me, Dr. Vollin, Dr. Halden is on the phone, sir. I've told him you didn't wish to be disturbed, sir... ...but he says it's very urgent. Yes, Dr. Halden. But you know that I've retired from actual practice... ...and I'm doing only research. Who is on the case? Well, I'm satisfied. They can handle it as well as I. But Dr. Vollin, I... Let me, Jerry. Dr. Vollin, this is Judge Thatcher speaking. It's my daughter. She's... She's met with a serious accident... ...and none of the doctors in attendance... That's very flattering, but no. No, Judge Thatcher. I'm sure they can handle it as well as I. I'm sorry. He's hung up. What's his home address? Hillview Heights. Why? I'm going there. Mr. Chapman, I don't like to ask you to go, but I'm tired. If you come again sometime, I will show you those models I built. They are down in my cellar. I should like to see them. Next time. Yes. I've actually built... ...you know, several of those torture and horror devices... ...that Poe described in his tales. The Pit and the Pendulum. That's the thrill of it, isn't it? Well, I certainly look forward to seeing them. Imagine building those things. A very curious hobby. It's more than a hobby. Good night, Mr. Chapman. Good night, Doctor. But you can't say no. I have said it. I'll pay you any amount of money, Dr. Vollin. Money means nothing to me. But someone is dying. Your... Your obligation as a member of the medical profession. I respect no such obligation. I'm a law unto myself. But have you no human feeling? My daughter is dying. Death, hasn't the same significance for me... ...as it has for you. But you're the one chance she's got. Doctors Cook and Hemingway are competent doctors. Competent. It seems that competence is not enough. Cook and Hemingway and Halden... ...they say that you're the only one. So they do say I'm the only one. Yes. I... I beg you for my daughter's life. Very well. I will go. Start the anesthetic. You're not only a great surgeon, but a great musician, too. Extraordinary man. You're almost not a man. Almost... A god? Yes. A God with the taint of human emotions. The scar is almost gone. I'm so glad. When I touch it, does it still hurt? No. A month ago, I didn't know you. But now, I owe my life to you. I wish there were something I could do. There is. Tell me. The restraint that we impose upon ourselves... ...can drive us mad. I don't know what you mean. Jerry... Jerry Halden tells me you've made him your assistant. It means we can be married that much sooner. Now, I owe you another debt. You owe me nothing. I did it to give him something, to take the place... ...of what he's losing. They're expecting me at dinner. I... I think I'd better run along. You're coming to see me dance tomorrow night? Nothing can keep me away. Thanks to you, I'm able to dance again. I'm going to have a surprise for you. Surprise? Tomorrow night. Goodbye. "Once upon a midnight dreary... "while I pondered, weak and weary... "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore... "While I nodded, nearly napping... "suddenly there came a tapping... "As of some one gently rapping... "rapping at my chamber door. "'Tis some visitor,' I muttered... "'tapping at my chamber door... "Only this, and nothing more. ' "Ah, distinctly I remember... "it was in the bleak December... "And each separate dying ember... "wrought its ghost upon the floor. "Eagerly I wished the morrow, vainly I had tried to borrow... "From my books surcease of sorrow... "sorrow for the lost Lenore... "For the rare and radiant maiden... ...whom the angels name Lenore" Did they really like me? No, not much, they only called you back 12 times. Oh, darling, isn't it wonderful? I can dance again. All our children will be dancers, I can see them. The 14 Dancing Holdens. That's what you think. Here, dear, take my slippers off for me. Of course. Oh, Jean, you were darling. ...most charming. Not only charming but dramatic as well. Thank you so much. That was marvelous, dear. Dad. What do you call that dance? You've never done that before, have you? I call it "The Spirit of Poe. " So that was your surprise. Was it a great surprise? "Whom the angels call Lenore" I told you never to come into this room unless I send for you. I'm sorry, sir. Judge Thatcher is here. Judge Thatcher here. Yes, sir. All right, send him in. Very good, sir. Good afternoon, Dr. Vollin. Good afternoon. Will you step in? Thank you. You were expecting my daughter. You see, last night, while Jean was dancing... I... I observed something that... That worried me. Later on, in Jean's dressing room, I... I felt the same thing. Then I... I questioned Jean. And she made a confession. She's in danger of becoming infatuated with you. Of course, I can understand that. You... You saved her life, Dr. Vollin. You think it's only gratitude she feels? Oh, don't say it that way, Dr. Vollin. Don't cheat us of the right to be grateful to you. Come to the point, Thatcher. Well, I made it about as plain as I can without, uh... Look here, you... You know that Jean's engaged to young Jerry Halden. Now we can't let her get any ideas about you, can we? You are saying, Judge Thatcher... ...that Jean has fallen in love with me. No, I'm not quite saying that. That you do not approve. You disapprove yourself, Dr. Vollin. You don't want a young girl like Jean falling in love with you. Dr. Vollin, I... I came to you once... ...and asked you, when death was near, to save Jean. I come to you again. But this time... ...instead of from death, you want to save her from me. Oh. I never realized, Vollin. I'm sorry you feel like this. Now that you know... ...you still say that your greatest wish is for her to marry Halden? More than ever. There's no point in saving Jean's life... ...if we're going to sacrifice her happiness. You mustn't see her again. You driveling fool. Stop talking. Be careful, Vollin. Not see her again? Listen, Thatcher... I'm a man who renders humanity a great service. For that, my brain must be clear... ...my nerves steady and my hands sure. Jean torments me. She has come into my life. Into my brain. Forget it, man. Forget it. Judge Thatcher, there are no two ways. Send her to me. Do you know what you're saying? There are no two ways. Send her to me. You're mad. I am mad. And I tell you, the only way you can cure... I can't talk to you, Vollin. I came here with a perfectly reasonable objection... ...and expected you to be reasonable. Instead I find you stark, staring mad. Good day, Dr. Vollin. Send her, Judge Thatcher. I warn you. Doctor Vollin. Home, Hillview Heights. I want to see Dr. Vollin. What do you want to see Dr. Vollin about? I am Dr. Vollin. I want to see you. Come this way. Come into my office. Come. You're Edmond Bateman. Who told you? Your picture in the papers. That's no disguise. That's why I'm here. He said you could do... What was it he called it? I want you should change my face. But I'm not a plastic surgeon, Bateman. He said you could do it. That is unnecessary, Bateman. Put it away. I can do it. I can change your face. Then do it. It isn't plastic surgery... ...but there is a way. Any way! It's all right with me. First, you must do something for me. Like what? It's in your line. Like what? Torture and murder. That's not my line. My line is... You shot your way out of San Quentin. Two guards are dead. In a bank in Arizona, a man's face was mutilated, burnt. Cashier of the bank. Well, he tried to get me into trouble. I told him to keep his mouth shut. He gets the gag out of his mouth... ...and starts yellin' for the police. I had the acetylene torch in my hand... So, you put the burning torch into his face. Into his eyes. Well, sometimes you can't help things like that. This job I want done is in your line, Bateman. Accept my word for it. I want you to do this for me. Then, I change your face. I got money. I'll pay for it. No money. I don't want to get into no more trouble. And they're after me now. I can take care of that. You can stay here after the job is done. I'll tell you something, Doc... ...ever since I was born... ...everybody looks at me and says, "You're ugly. " Makes me feel mean. Why are you telling me this? I am not interested in your life story. I'm saying, Doc... ...maybe because I look ugly... Maybe if a man looks ugly, he does ugly things. You are saying something profound. A man with a face so hideously ugly... Don't ask me to do this job for you, Doc. I don't want to do them things no more. Fix me so I look good, will you? Then maybe I could... All right, Bateman. You'll do it, Doc? You'll change me? Yes. When? Now. What's that? You don't need that. Give it to me. No, you don't. I'll keep this. What's that? I'm taking you where if police or anyone should come... ...they can't find you. Oh, oh, I see what you mean. It is to protect you, Bateman. Come. You go first. Of course. I show you the way. The operation is very simple. In 10 minutes, it's done. Is that all it takes? The nerves, the nerve ends, Bateman... ...the seventh cranial nerve, which has its root here... ...from this come the nerves that control the muscles of the face. If something happens to these nerve ends... ...it alters your expression. In other words, I who know what to do with these nerve ends... ...can make you look anyway I choose. Now, loosen your collar. Lie down. I will not need you until Monday. Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant holiday. Thank you, sir. Ah, you're doing fine, Bateman. I will take a look. It's hard to talk. That's to be expected. It will disappear. Do... Do I look different? Yes. Something's the matter. My eye. That will pass, Bateman. My mouth. I want to see myself. All right. Just wait here. No! Bateman. Are you ready to do it for me, Bateman? Fix my mouth. You're monstrously ugly. Monstrous ugliness breeds monstrous hate. Good. I can use your hate. You will do this for me, Bateman. Fix my mouth. I'll fix your mouth, Bateman. Do it. Change me. I'll change you, Bateman. You will look good. The way you wish. Make me look good. First you must do this job for me, Bateman. I can't use my hand to do it. Your hand is used to torture. Your hand must do it. My brain. Your hand. Speak up, Bateman. Do you wish to remain the ugly monster that you are? No. No. Then you will do this job for me, will you? You must speak now. Yes or no. Yes. Good. Wait. Put on these clothes... ...and report to me for further instructions. Be quick about it. In an hour, my guests will arrive. I wonder if Dad will be very angry. Why should he? He distinctly said no when we got the invitation. Why? Well... Don't go into that again. We've been all over that before. Well, I do agree with him that Dr. Vollin is a little mad. Well, aren't we all? What of it? You know, uh, you're taking quite a chance persuading me to go. How? He kind of likes me. Yeah, I'll bet. All right, what will you bet? I'll bet you... All right. Place your bets. They're off! Please notify my horse the race has started. Oh, isn't it exciting, Pinkie? Y- Yes, quite. I like my horse. He has such a kind face. The quarter. Come on, Number 5! Number 3. Number 3! Come on Number 5! Number 3. Number 3. Number 3. Doesn't my horse look like your father, Pinkie? I hadn't noticed the resemblance, my love. Come on, Azucar! Ladysman. They're on the home stretch. I will not let myself get excited. I'm afraid to look. Who's winning? Number 5 wins. That's me! I'm the winner. Wasn't mine the brown horse, Pinkie? No, no. Yours was the white, my love. Oh. I've been rooting for the wrong horse. Oh, Jerry, you idiot, what're you doing? I'll be a mess, you fool. Stop it. Next race. Place your bets. Now, I'll have to go upstairs and fix my hair. I'm a sight, I know. Well, don't forget you owe me two bits. You know, I like horses, I... I grew up with them. Yes, I can see that when I look at you. Does anyone want any more horse races? Not me. It's too exhausting a game for me. Let's go and get a drink. Feel this, my pet. Just what am I supposed to feel? My pulse. It's beating. I'm going to ask Dr. Vollin's advice. Doctor. Yes, Colonel. I get the most peculiar sensations, uh, pains you might call them. Not exactly pains, but, uh, they come and they go. What would you say they were? You eat too much, Colonel. I'm asking Dr. Vollin, my pet. You're always trying to get free advice. Now, now, my pet. You know, the other evening we met Dr. Thayor... ...and he turned out to be a veterinary. My pet, he gave me some very good advice about my dogs. Man to see you. Excuse me. Oh, p-please, don't stand there. Yes. Move away, my man, like a good fellow. Never stand behind people. Most unfortunate looking fellow. I'm so glad you have come, Judge Thatcher. Dr. Vollin, is my daughter here? Judge Thatcher, I'm genuinely sorry... ...for all the stupid things I said to you the other day. I want you, please, to forget. One can't forget a man saying... But I... I was under terrible strain... ...and if you can feel in anyway indebted to me... ...clear your debts by forgiving me for what I said. Well, I suppose a man can... Oh, I... You do forgive me. Now let's go and... And join the others. Go upstairs and tell Miss Thatcher her father is here. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Glad to see you. Hello, Judge, I was wondering whether you'd arrived. That's from upstairs. Oh, Dad, I'm so glad you are here. What happened? What's the matter? You look as white as a ghost. I just had a terrible fright. What was it? I was standing in my room looking in the mirror... ...when the door opened and an awful looking man came in. Oh, you mean, my servant, poor fellow. Come on, let's sit down. I will tell you about him. Come. I'm sorry, Miss Thatcher, that my servant scared you. Please be seated. All of you, please. Poor fellow... ...he can't help the way he looks. He served in my regiment. Arab bandits took him a prisoner. They mutilated him and tortured him. They have a genius for devising torture. It's almost the equal of Edgar Allan Poe. Dr. Vollin is keen about Poe. Yes, I've noticed. Why your extraordinary interest in Poe, Dr. Vollin? That poem of Poe's, The Raven. I say, what is The Raven? It's a bird, Pinkie. A pretty thing to have around the house. But isn't the raven the symbol of death? It always has been. What is your interpretation of The Raven? I will tell you. Poe was a great genius. Like all great geniuses... ...there was in him the insistent will... ...to do something big, great, constructive in the world. He had the brain to do it. But he fell in love. Her name was Lenore. "Longing for the lost Lenore" "Longing for the lost Lenore" Something happened... ...someone took her away from him. When a man of genius is denied of his great love, he goes mad. His brain instead of being clear to do his work... ...is tortured. So he begins to think of torture. Torture for those who have tortured him. My interest in Poe... ...the way I speak about torture and death... ...you people, being laymen, perhaps do not understand. As a doctor, a surgeon, I look on these things differently. A doctor is fascinated by death and pain. How much pain a man can endure. But I disagree with you, Dr. Vollin. That's not why I'm a doctor. You're a doctor because you want to do good. Yes. Please let's change the subject. Let's go to bed. Why, Colonel, where are your company manners? I'm sleepy, my pet. I'm sleepy, too, Pinkie. Let's all go to our nice warm beds... ...on this cold, windy night. Well, if it isn't rude to our host. On the contrary... I am flattered that you act as if you were at home. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Sorry? You came into the room so suddenly. Please believe I wouldn't have been frightened otherwise. Oh, Jean. Coming. Jean! Come on, darling. This is your room, Judge Thatcher. Thank you. Uh, Dr. Vollin, may I see you for just a minute? I'd like to know about the drafts in this house. You know, I'm very sensitive about drafts. I'm certain you'll be comfortable. Thank you. Please. Allow me. After you, sir. This man, Vollin is stark, staring mad. Why, Dad! Now, you came here against my wishes. All right, it's done. But now let's get our things together and go home. What? Let's go home. But why? In the talk I had with him the other day, he said some things... ...that absolutely convinced me he's not in his right mind. And just now, the way he talked about Poe and... And torture... Oh, talk, that's all it was. He was being amusing. Well, I'm afraid there's something wrong with my sense of humor. I tell you, it's dangerous to be under this man's roof. Oh, Dad, he's not going to cut our throats while we're asleep. Well, I think it's entirely possible. Grown-up people. When a perfectly reputable and distinguished surgeon talks about Poe... ...why get scared? There's absolutely nothing to be afraid of. Come in. Get out of here. Judge Thatcher. Bateman! What are you doing here? Go downstairs. You mustn't be frightened. The poor fellow means nothing. Probably came up to see if there's anything he could do for you. Are you comfortable? Quite, thank you. Yes. Thank you, I'm sure we shall be very comfortable. Good. Then I'll leave you now. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. You're worried about Jean, aren't you? Yes, I am. You're afraid that in the middle of the night he might... Don't you think it would be a good idea if I changed rooms with her? And what about you? Well, he certainly isn't coming into my room. Well, let me do that then. Come on. I'll go change rooms with Jerry. All right. Take my bags, dear, will you? All right. Come along, Bateman. The most unique museum of torture. Rare old pieces, all of them. But I warn you, ready for use. This device is from one of Poe's stories. The Pit and the Pendulum. A man was thrown into a pit... ...and tied to a slab like this. Suddenly he hears some peculiar noise coming from above his head. He looks up... ...sees a knife flashing. Swinging rhythmically... ...as it gradually descends. These things here are manacles... ...which are controlled by that lever. Clasped around the wrists and ankles... ...they hold a man on the slab... ...helpless. He cannot move. In 15 minutes, the knife reaches the heart. Got you. Come on, Bateman. Release me. Release me, Bateman. And please try to remember, should anything happen to me... ...you remain the hideous monster that you are. Come on, Bateman. It's all quite simple, isn't it, Bateman? Jerry, oh, I'm afraid! What-What's the matter? What's happened? Look in my room. All right, come on then if you're afraid. Darling, that's nothing. The wind's blown a tree down, it's fallen against your window, that's all. Here, put your robe on or you'll get cold. Jerry, I saw a man coming up through the floor. Darling, I can understand you imagining all sorts of things... ...but not a man coming up through the floor. I'm not imagining it. I'll tell you what you do, you sleep in your own room. Come on. Now you hop right into bed. You've got to get some sleep, you know. I guess, Daddy was right after all. We probably should have gone home. Don't be silly. There. You all right now? Yes, dear. Not frightened anymore? Uh-uh. Good night, my sweet. Good night, darling. What do you mean sneaking up through the trapdoor? Don't compel me to treat you like an animal. You were looking for the girl, weren't you? Answer me. Yes. The girl does not concern you. Why did you try to go to her? Answer me, why? Who is that? It's the Colonel. My wife wants a sleeping powder, Dr. Vollin. She woke me out of a sound sleep... ...and told me to go down and get a sleeping powder. You know, there-there's nothing worse... ...than being wakened from that first sweet sleep. I doubt if I shall fall asleep again. Certainly. Just wait a moment here. Oh, pardon me. I- I'm so sleepy. Here are two powders. Two? One for you. For me? Huh, Dr. Vollin, I don't know how to thank you. Such a nice man, so thoughtful. It's now 11:00. The job begins. Let me go! Let me go! Help! Help, Jerry! Help me! Help me! Help! Let me go! Greetings, Judge Thatcher. What's the meaning of this, Vollin? My servant is a little uncivilized, so I ask your forgiveness. Now, I see you can hardly stand on your feet. Bateman, see that Judge Thatcher lies down. Make him comfortable, Bateman. What's that thing? A knife. What's it doing? Descending. What are you trying to do to me? Torture you. Oh, try to be sane, Vollin. I'm the sanest man who ever lived. I will not be tortured... I tear torture out of myself by torturing you. 15 minutes. There's the clock. You can see it. Torture waiting. Waiting. It will be sweet, Judge Thatcher. No! Jerry, help! Jerry! Jerry! Do not be alarmed. I've a pleasant surprise for you. Jerry! Jerry! Help me. Jerry! Jean! Jerry! Jerry! Geoffrey! Geoffrey! Wake up, Geoffrey! They've got Jean! I say! What is it, old boy? They've got Jean. Wake Grant. Jerry! I couldn't wake either the Colonel or Mrs. Grant. They seem to have been drugged. Where's Judge Thatcher and Jean, old boy? They took Thatcher through this panel. They must have Jean, too. I can't open it. Here, let me help you, old chap. I've looked everywhere. I'll call the police. Hello. Hello, operator. Operator. The line's dead. What's that? What's what? Look! Oh, Pinkie! It's a steel shutter. There is now no way of getting in... ...no way of getting out. Help me! Jerry! Jerry, please! Jerry, please! Uh. Oh. We can't hear the wind anymore. It's as if we were all in a tomb. We've got to get through that panel. Do you mind if I smoke? Jerry! Jerry! Help me! Jerry! Jerry! Bateman, tell her to stop. Jerry, help me! Help me! What're you going to do to Jean? Oh, I have the most delightful plan for her. Help me. Jerry! Help me! He said stop. Yes... I'm ugly. He did it. Dr. Vollin? Yes. Oh, he's mad. What will he do to me? He won't hurt you. Will you help me? You will help me, won't you? You'll help me get out of here? No! No! Vollin is going... ...to fix my face. I tell you he's mad. He won't help you. I'll help you. Bateman. Please get me out of here. I swear, I'll help you. Bateman! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! I'm going through. That's what they want you to do. It's a trap. Going through all the same. Got to follow him. Oh. Oh, Pinkie! You know what to do, Bateman. Dad! Jerry! Please come! Jerry! You! Jerry! Oh, Jerry! It's Jean! The switch, to open this lock. It's locked. The servant must have the key. Jean! Jean! Jean! Don't do it, he'll kill you. Bateman, bring him here. Jerry. You're just in time to be witnesses to a wedding ceremony. Now the ceremony begins. Too bad, Judge Thatcher cannot be with us. But if we speak loudly enough, perhaps he can hear us. At any rate, we can hear him. At least let my father go. We will dismiss the question of your father. Consider it well disposed off. See here, Vollin, things like this can't be done. It's no use, Geoffrey. Look at his eyes. I'll soon be rid of my torture. Rid of it! And I'll be the sanest man who ever lived. Now... I have a pleasant surprise. Bateman. Do as I order, Bateman! The switch. My gift to you two. The place in which you will live. A humble place, but your love will make it beautiful. All right, go in. Go in. You will live in this place forever and ever. It will be the perfect marriage. The perfect love. You will never be separated. Never. Bateman! Bateman! Come on, Bateman, close it! Forever and ever. What a torture! What a delicious torture, Bateman. Greater than Poe. Poe only conceived it. I have done it, Bateman. Poe, you're avenged! What happens in that room? Another one of Poe's devices, Bateman. It's the room where the walls come together. Darling... ...there's nothing we can do. It doesn't take long, Bateman, until they're crushed, dead. That girl... ...dead? Why not? You've killed in your time. You monster, you like to torture. Yes. I like to torture. You've done nobly, Bateman. Now, I'll do nobly by you. You-You'll fix me? Yes. She crushed to death? Yes. No! No. What are you doing? First, I let her go. If you touch that switch, Bateman... I'll not fix you. No. You'll stay the way you are, Bateman. No! If you touch that... Stop! Bateman! Bateman! I'll get the key. You go to Thatcher. Come on, Geoffrey! I've got the key. Get that thing out of the way. Oh. Come on. Oh! Daddy! It's all right. It's all right, don't worry. No, it's all my fault. No, it's not your fault, dear. Don't blame yourself. I'm so sorry. We're all safe now. What is it, my pet? The Colonel. We've forgotten the Colonel and his wife. Poor Bateman. He gave up his life. Yes, darling, he saved us from being crushed, all right. Yes. I think I'd better finish the job, don't you? Only a little more gently. So you're the big, bad raven, huh?
