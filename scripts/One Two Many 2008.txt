See, that was me, fantasizing about every woman l saw. See, l was what yo might call a horn dog, a playboy, a gigolo. l'm what you ladies might call, well... a scumbag. See, l wasn't a bad guy, it's just that every girl l saw, ljust-- ljust had to get into bed with. panting Oh, yeah. screams Unh! Uhh! Excuse me. Well, almost every girl l saw. Uhh! Anyway, l always wanted to get married, be a dad, have kids, but how could l do both? l mean, how could l keep on being with women, and start a family? Than l had this brilliant idea. bell dings l need to find a girl that wold be willing to bring otherwomen into bed with me. Well, what happened to Kelly? l broke up with her. Well, she broke up with me. Actually, she hitme overthe head with a nine iron , then broke up with me. Unh! She hit yo overthe head with a nine iron ? Actually, it was a fouriron, but who's counting? Unh! Why? Because l was cheating on her. Oh. See, l had this wandering penis problem. lt's like a vagining rod. All right, and she was upset with you, right, Tom? sobbing No, l don't think so. Mm-hmm. See, every time l see a new girl, l gotta get her-- Acceptance. Acceptance? You can't say no, Thomas. You cheat because you wantthe constant love and approval from others because you nevergotthose things from yorfamily. Yoursiblings ridiculed you, yourdad beatyou, humiliated yo , and neveraccepted you. Well, not exactly. Doc, how can my penis have anything to do with the family? Then, when you get these women to love you, you wantto get rid ofthem. Why would l do that? You question their credibility if they could love a loserlike yourself. l do? Yeah. Yorfamily considered you a loser, Thomas. And that's why you seek the constant love and affection from others. To prove them wrong. Doc, couldn't it just be that l'm horny? Doubtful, Thomas. Look, yo push people away who love you because you feel unworthy oflove, happiness, self-respect. And we're seeing these same things happen in yor relationships. You try and create obstacles that'll keep yo from having a happy relationship. For instance, rememberJasmine? Yeah. Well, yo dumped her. She had hygiene problems. Hervagina was shaved like the Hitler mustache. Every time l went down on her, l thought of the Third Reich. What abot Charlene? She had nine fingers. Well, Debra. Please. Look, at least when l take a dump, and there's people nearby, l have the courtesy to flush to drown outthe noise. farting Thomas, don'tyou see, you create these problems. What do you mean? Well, this one...farts, this one has nine fingers, and this one has a funny-looking... hoo -haha. lt's not that. ljust need to find a woman that'll allow otherwomen into bed with us. That, Derek, is my idea of the perfect woman. Well, cold be hard to find a woman that accommodating. Perhaps we should call her the hard to find woman. laughs Sorry, Thomas, it's, uh... Time's up. chuckling l'm telling yo , man, l'm gonna find her. Good. l mean, there's gotta be a girl like that out there somewhere. Right, right. We'll see you nextweek. All right, man. See ya, doc. Right. What do you think of monogamy? Well, my father used to have a coffee table that was made out of that. No, no, no. Monogamy. Not mahogany. Oh, oh . lt's absolutely horrible. lt's so disgusting. You mean you've neverbeen in a serious relationship? Well, yeah, of corse. l love my boyfriend. Wait a minute, if you love yor boyfriend, why don't yo like monogamy? Look, pay me forthe dance. So, why are yo here? See, l figured if l fond a woman who's already into being with women, well, then, l'm halfway there. Listen, asshole, the sight of a penis makes me gag. What? Yes, that's right. Single white male... ...seeks bisexual woman... Justthink, l could be having sex with you while the girl's having sex with you, too. laughs You're kidding, right? stammers ...who seeks relationship with man... l think we're a part of the earth, yo know? We're born in the earth, and we die in the earth. l love everybody. No, l love everything. They're all so beautiful to me. Everything excites me. l-- Do yo look at people? Look at everyone.
