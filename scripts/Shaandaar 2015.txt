And a man named Bipin... ...was coming home with a little orphan. Bipin lived with his termagant of a mother. And his wife who was even more of a terror. In her world, every relationship was a deal. Her world was a marketplace. And in her marketplace, a child with no antecedents counted for nothing. Bipin's mother and wife rejected the child at first glance. But thanks to her survival instinct... ...the little one would not be budged. - Alert! Alert! - Danger! Bipin never told anyone where the girl came from or why he brought her home. Never. And the termagants asked quite often. One day, Bipin found out... ...that his motherless tyke was a baby owl. Her friends were bats. He tried everything he could... ...but he could not get her to sleep, perchance to dream. She stayed awake all night. But all day, she was awake too. But Bipin was not one to give up. One day, he gave his princess a box. It was a dream box. Dreams? Every day, he drew her a new dream, just for her. All this in the forlorn hope that his princess would one day sleep... ...and learn the joy of dreaming. But every princess needs a prince to coax her to the Land of Nod. "Riding a whim, I'm on my way..." "We were meant to meet, some day, some way..." "Riding a whim, I'm on my way..." "We were meant to meet, some day, some way..." "Riding a whim, I'm on my way..." Who is this numbskull'? Sorry, Daddy-O, I'm... What d'you mean 'sorry'? Can't you look where you're going? Blind turn back there, right'? Didn't see it. You aren't blind, are you'? I said, sorry, innit'? Hey, blind bat, what are you looking at'? Look at me and talk. You didn't see my car when you had to. Now look at me and talk. Yo, I said sorry three times. What more do you want'? C'mon give one back. What'? Return a sorry. What'? Until you return one of my 'sorries', I won't move. Who returns apologies? You do. Give one back or I stay put. - I've dealt with his kind before. - Stay in the car. Let me deal with this. Get this bike out of the way. Won't. Whatcher gonna do about it'? - Hey - Hey-e'! - Hey-ey-e'! - Hey-eV-QWQV You wanna make something of this'? Do you know who I am'? Who are you'? Why would I tell you'? Do you know who I am'?

Why is Fundwani's photo bigger than mine'? Fundwani paid for the photo. We paid for the article. But now we'll all be one big happy family so what's the difference, Nlummyji'? It makes a difference! I don't care if he's paid for the entire magazine. Who's paying for this wedding? You are, Mummyji. Who else can'? Explain that to him. Why do you think I've brought that fatso up'? When you sacrifice the goat, you eat the meat. - Come on... come on... Come on, BTB! BTB! BTB! Deep breaths, deep breaths... What is BTB'? - Come on! - Bride-to-be! - Breathe in... breathe in. I can't. You've cut it way too small, Uncle. Shut your face. I opened it out four inches in Delhi and then it fit. But now you've come here and swelled up again. This is a brilliant sketch of your Robin. Very nice. Thanks. They' re for Eesha. - You can do it. Try the upper hooks. - Hi baby. - Hi Mama. Say no. Do you know? The average chocolate has the legs of eight insects in it. Eight! As they make the chocolate, the bug feet fall in. This is no average chocolate, Alia. It's a fact.

Mummyji, I withdraw my resignation. I was going to come to you to ask about tomorrows programme. - Everyone, come and meet me. I have something important to say. - Mummyji, he was rude to Vinay. He shoved him about. If he had given you and Vipul a couple of good ones, I would have given him a bonus. - You doofoids... ...if JJ goes, this wedding stops. And if the wedding doesn't happen, you know what will happen? If the wedding doesn't happen, the business deal falls through. Right. She has more brains than the three of you put together.

Ooh, did that bother you'? I'm your mother. Can't you do that much for me'? Bear with it for a few days more. You know we haven't a red cent in the bank. And under the Companies Act, all of you are already bankrupt. We've put the leavings and scrapings into this deal.

Alia sleeps with Jagjinder Joginder. How dare he! I'll kill him if he so much as lays a hand on her. Shut up, Papa. Alia goes to sleep now. She can sleep because of Joginder. Alia didn't even know what a dream was up to now. Isn't that what you always wanted'? That she should sleep, perchance to dream? Please don't separate them, Papa. But he's not good enough for her, my girl. Maybe not. But who will be suitable for Alia'? Who will love her more than you'? That means whoever comes along will always be second-best, right'? But you won't get a better second-best than Jaginder Joginder. What rot you talk. There are much better boys. Like the one you found for me'? Like the one Grandma found for you'? Will you let that happen to Alia too'? If you stop her today, Dad, Grandma will turn her into a deal too. Will you be able to do anything then'? Or even say anything? You've never said a thing but do it now. For Alia. She's your favourite, isn't she'? Okay, Dad, just come with me. Come no'? - Where? - Come on. Where, kid'? Please.

And I'm not even a priest. - No. I'm not. I'm a cricket commentator. Ever since Sidhu has taken to commentary, I've been out of work. So I developed this spiel. How'? The pitch puts a damper on play, the weather will hamper the way the boys play. The Lanka batsmen are on the heavy side but they show no playing pride. India bats next, the bowlers are hexed and the batsmen are vexed. Swaha... Enough of this nonsense! This is no joke. it's business. This marriage will happen. Or I shoot to the kill.

Oh Sanghkara, why hit so hard'? And our little man is a tub of lard. Your daughter's getting married. Be happy. And Sachin is stumped for a way forward. What is this'? Good going, Robin. I'm going to fire a few shots too. Before the wedding. Before the wedding. Mummy your cannon, the hope of the nation. I didn't shoot. I fired. No no no, not my bro. Hands up. No one moves. - I've always wanted to say that line. Another one: we have you surrounded. - That's just dialogue. Stay focused. One more. One more dialogue. If you value your lives, throw down your guns! One more. What would you know of the value of marriage? Superb. That itty-bitty pistol? Daddy-O, take it away from them. No, please don't. This is...this is... ...family possession. This is...this is... my property, ancestral property, ...my great grandfather gave me this gun. This is the crazy, you are the Harry, I'm the Bipin. We're all Sindhi and we speak Sindhi and the world is Sindhi. We have nothing in common. - Keep it here. - Yeah, thanks. Only Sindhi. Like the peach! - Daddy-o, let's get out of here. Shall we flee'?

"What was supposed to be a sweet deal Turned out to be a total steal." "Everyone's true nature was revealed." "Everyone's true nature was revealed." Who's going to pay me back'? - Hey...wow. - We're good. We made it. Alia, it's Uncle Vipul. Safe. I'm sorry. Sorry. it's ok, it doesn't matter, chill. Set me down anywhere you like. - Where do I set you down'? - I'll throw you out. Your bro isn't going to be happy. Bro will be busy paying his debts. - Huh'? - Debt'? My bro is bankrupt. - Bankrupt? - He's skint. What we had left, we put into the wedding. Now he won't even be able to pay for my protein shakes. So you lot were in the same state as we were. Shut up!
