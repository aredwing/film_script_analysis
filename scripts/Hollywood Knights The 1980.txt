Oh, I see that the hangout for the Hollywood Knights, Tubby's Drive-In, is coming down tonight. Fellas, don't get bummed out. Remember: A friend with weed is a friend indeed. 3:29, Beach Boys time. Man, she saw it. That's great. Hey, what are you doing over there? I'm doing Dr. Eisner's new facial exercises. Oh, it's wonderful. It keeps your skin circulating. It keeps you young. It's great. It's a bear-lion. You go: Aah. Mmm. Aah. Doesn't that stretch your skin out? Oh, no, it's circulation. It's great. It keeps you young and youthful, gorgeous. I'm gonna tie my bathing suit here to the chair. But I don't know why you're doing that. You know, last time I did that, my tits got... They peeled so much I went from a size B cup to an A. What's that clicking noise? - You hear it. - It's a camera. Camera! You little creep! What is that? What are you doing? WOMAN 1: Camera! Camera! What are you, crazy? I'll sue you for trespassing! Clark, we got a couple of party boys here that love to scare old ladies. You don't have to work for Scotland Yard to know about this. A potato? This was in the tailpipe of the chief's car last week. Get down! Clark, look what we got here. Empty egg carton. That tell you anything? You boys making omelets? What are you laughing at, huh? You know what I'd like to do to you now, Newbomb? I'd like to kick the crap out of you, that's what I'd like to do! What's the problem, officer? Oh, we got it taken care of, sir. Thank you very much. Everything's fine. No problem. Just got some punks out here, and that's it. Wake up, Bimbeau. I want you to get something straight. I don't need the captain all over my butt about some rinky-dink drive-in. Do me a favor, Bimbeau. Don't aggravate the situation. Everything's under control, sarge. It's okey-dokey. Besides, sarge, as a matter of fact, if any of those little assholes get out of line... ...I'll personally kick the shit out of them. That's exactly what we don't want, Bimbeau. The drive-in's coming down. They'll all be gone tomorrow. We don't need police brutality. Got it? Hear that? Right. Yeah. Bimbeau, what in the hell is that? No, no. Here! Woo-hoo. Woo-hoo. Oh, not that house. People have been bad there. Mooning! Mooning! Mooning, Mr. Katzenberg. Absolutely. We've all had these disgusting experiences with these Hollywood Knights, and I give you my word, tonight is the last night the Hollywood Knights will ever be in Beverly Hills again. Isn't that wonderful? Oh. I want to send my husband Jack's apologies to all of you. He was real sorry he couldn't be here tonight. Anyway, he'll be at the pep rally later giving the awards, and of course, we'll see him at the dance. Well... What's the song he's got now? The, uh... "Tijuana Taxi. " With the horn honk, the "beep, beep" at the end of it. What the hell is that supposed to be? That's popular music. Where the hell is the story in a "beep, beep"? Yeah. Tell you what popular music is... I know what popular music is. You don't know. I do. Starting tomorrow, today will be history... Horseshit! Nevans, there's some distracting noise in the kitchen. Could you see what that is? That's the Beverly Hills Police Department. They're out there with Juanita. Bullshit! Take care of it. I'll see if I can't quiet those people down. Anyway, Tubby's Drive-In, this social disease of our neighborhood, well, it's enjoying its last night of residence in Beverly Hills. I knew you'd all be pleased because all of our... Thank you. And one year from today, this beautiful office complex Will be standing in the old Tubby's Drive-In's place. I assure you that you and none of the rest of you have to worry about the Hollywood Knights any longer. We won't be hearing from them again. Go, go, go! They're out of... Excuse me. Juanita's busy. I'll get the door. It's fine. No, really, I... Well, all right. We'll both get it. Why not? I need you. Watch it. Stand back. Stand back. Nevans! Get it! Get it out! It's dog shit! It's dog shit all over you! Mrs. Friedman! I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you! Shit. Shit. Juanita! Juanita, get out here! They finally come. Nice to see you. Nice of you to make it. Nice of you to come. Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Hey, no problem. I spoke to Wheatly, and he'll be here in a minute. Hey, I was talking to Red. He's pretty bent, man. They've been here for about 21 years. Said he's been thinking about moving to New Jersey. You know, this is compliments of the Beverly Hills Asshole Association. Everybody showing up tonight. All the flatheads forever are showing up tonight. Wheatly. Mr. Wheatly, nice of you to join us tonight. How you guys doing? What's going on? Hey, Wheatly, where you been? I was kicking some ass. You were kicking ass? He was kissing ass. Hey, listen, we got all our cars here tonight. Except one. Yeah, Simpson, when you gonna bring your rail job? I mean, this is the last night. Where is this Flying Purple People Eater you keep talking about? Relax, relax. I gotta wait till my old man goes to sleep so I can wheel it out. Maybe you want me to follow you home. You know, you might be a little bit nervous. Everybody is showing. You know, there is gonna be a ton of lead sleds in the block tonight. Yeah, that's great. You know what? Everybody'll think... ...we're a bunch of '50s queers when they come in here. Hey, how long you got your brother's car for? For as long as I like. Yeah, sure. Hey, Newbomb, I saw your brother. He's a monster. Do I look worried? Do I appear worried? Bimbeau. Bimbeau. Bimbeau. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. What? How do you think I'd look in a mustache, huh? Think I'd be better-looking than I am already? Perfect. Perfect jerk. Good... Jerk? Good-looking. Just like the guys we bust every night. No, that's perfect for you. Lawrence Lawrence of Arabia He's an English guy He came to fight the Turkish Okay, Clark, right there. That's what I'm talking about. "Lawrence of Arabia" doesn't have any lyrics to it. Doesn't have any words. What do you mean? It's music. It's music. Hey, I've seen the movie four times. And there were no words to it. There are no words to that! Did you hear what I was saying earlier? Somewhere, I know that somebody, I think, wrote lyrics to this song. Horseshit. There are no words. Horseshit? Horseshit. There are no words to it. Hey, Bimbeau. Bimbeau. Bimbeau. Kiss my ass. All right? Do the fake mustache and mark off another spot, and that'll be your ass. Hey, you want me to put an X on my ass? You can find it that way. Pull over here. I gotta take a squirt. Will you? Give me a break. Hey, these guys are lucky. We're leaving them in Watts. Last year we left them in a bad neighborhood. These guys are punks. When I got into the Knights, I had to climb a greased pole and they put eggs up my butt. I know. You should suffer, you know? Let's go, guys. Out, out, out. Everybody out. It's initiation time. Let's go. Come on, man. Let's go. This is not a party. You want a party? Come back after initiation. Get against the car. Out of sight. - Okay, drop them. - What? Get your clothes off! Strip, man! Let's go. You should be proud to be Knights. Don't give me that look. You're lucky. We used to tar and feather the pledges. You know what I mean? Wheatly, look at that. That looks like a penis, only smaller. Hey, listen, go in the back there. I want the tires out of the truck, I want your clothes in. Tires out, I want the clothes in. What are we gonna do with the tires? Here's the plan of action. I want to see you and the tires back at Tubby's at 2:00. If you are not back by 2:00, I do not want to see you back at all. Because at 2:00, gentlemen, I expect to hear the dedication over the radio that you've delivered the message to the DJ at the record store. Are we set there, gentlemen? Are we ready? Very, very, very good. Gentlemen, goodbye, good luck. And think of this as a great adventure. It's Halloween, jackoff. Let's go, let's have some fun. Take off your shorts! Come on. Come on, man.

Nobody knows about it. Now, will you stop worrying? We're alone. Nobody knows we're here. I'm telling you. I can't believe we're doing this.

I read about a new bust exercise. Really? Where? In the Vogue magazine. Especially from Europe. I paid $6 for it. Ooh, does that feel good. Freedom at last. You think I should wear a bra?

I gotta have a nighttime job so I can be free during the day. Yeah, I almost forgot. You're gonna be a famous actress. That's what pisses you off, isn't it? That I might become somebody. I think you're somebody right now. Oh, shit, come on. Look, I gotta start looking after tonight anyway. You know, I think you're right. You should go out and... ...find a job right away so you don't starve to death. What do you want me to do? You're gonna start college in January, you got a part-time job here at Smitty's. Right. Hey, it's not my fault you're a carhop. Do you think I like all them jerks making wiseass cracks about my old lady all night? You don't like it? Look, I'm the one that's gotta put up with it. Look, I gotta get in there. I'll talk to you later, okay? If I can't get off early, are you gonna wait for me? I gotta tell Red. I don't know. Shit. Hey, that's the car James Dean drove, man.

Hey, hey, hey, you two girls want a thrill? I'm not paying any attention. Hey, Iron Box, I'm talking to you and your girlfriend. Very funny. Hey, have you ever heard my version of that song? Oh, my God, we have to get out of here. Why? He's gonna fart the song. He's gonna what? He's going to fart the song. You're gonna love it. Stay there. Let me warm up. Hey, look, there's that red Dodge! Hey, Jimbo. What do you say, Jimmy? Hey, Jimmy, kind of cold on that thing or what? Colder than a witch's tit. Ah, hey. Here. What's this? Go on, keep it. You'll need something to read on the bus. I'll pick up another one. Jimmy, you know, I was thinking, if you have to go overseas, man, I'll collect all those magazines from the guys and I'll send them over to you. Thanks. I never thought of that. But I probably won't be going over to Vietnam. The only people they're sending over is advisers. Hey, I thought last month, when Dee Dee was late, I wouldn't be going. They ain't taking anybody with babies. That's a tough break. You're gonna get the experience of a lifetime. I remember the first time I ever saw you two guys. Do you remember that? You came rolling that bicycle in here with two flat tires and a broken chain and the bent handlebars. I looked at you and said, "Get that thing out of here. We fix cars. " Yeah, fix cars. Thirty minutes later it was fixed, and we were riding it. You know, I can't believe it, man. You know there's only four pledges this year? I remember when I was in junior high school, everybody wanted to be a Knight. I just don't know anymore, man. Everything changes. Remember that. Nothing stays the same. I got it. Look, I'm telling you, Barbara does not put out, okay? She do. She do. No, she doesn't. She's a tramp. She's a tramp. She do. She do. Shorty. Wheatly, that girl's looking at me. What? That girl right there is looking at me. What girl? That girl right there with the red scarf. She's checking me out. Hey, look, she's not checking you out. She's looking through you to get to me. Uh-uh, man, she's looking right at me. Where? Right there with the red scarf on. Hey, are you looking at him? He thinks you're looking at him. Man, you asshole! You just blew it for me! I'm sorry. I can't believe you, Wheatly. I can't believe you sometimes. God! I'm sorry, all right? Don't get bent. How's it going? Hey, watch the car, all right? What are you talking about? Hey, listen, Moosie, cut your hair, okay? I gotta go practice now. Hey, hey, hey, you're into fine food. What do you get when you cross a donkey with a slice of Bermuda onion? I don't know. What? A piece of ass that brings tears to your eyes. You're boring, Turk. You're very boring. This dork? This dork is better, right? This dork, huh? Hey, dork. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, butt breath. What the hell did I tell you about your sidewalk surfing in public? Do you remember that conversation? Huh? I told you to hang ten in your neighborhood. What do you got in your pocket? A pack of cigarettes. Pack of cigarettes. You're a minor. What are you doing with them? They're for my mother. Give them here. Come on, get them out. For his mother. For your mother. You're lying to me, kid. You're lying to a police officer. You little son of a bitch. You just remember what we said about sidewalk surfing in public, all right? Now, take off. Hey, what's up, squirt? "Surf City. " Beaver patrol! Beaver patrol! Calling all beavers! Dawn! Hey, Dawn! You see these pictures? Dawn! I always thought you were a natural blond. Shut up, you idiot! You idiots! Have you seen these pictures, Dark? Dark, you gotta see these pictures of her. You know, that's so stupid, Turk! Keep the pictures. I'll take the real thing. Hey, Dawn! Great tits! Newbomb, that's your brother's car. You parked next to a fire hydrant. Big deal. It's Halloween. Okay, fine. I'll see you guys in the parking lot, all right? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. It's a wonderful-looking crowd tonight. I'm glad to see you all come out and support us this way. And we're gonna get those Panthers, aren't we? Well, I'm looking forward to seeing all of you over at the dance tonight, which is what I have to do right now, is go over... ...and take care of some last-minute details over there with the help of Mr. Nevans, so I'm gonna turn the evening over to my husband, Mr. Jack Friedman, and our good friend Mr. William Thornwell, who, of course, we all know as Thorny. So I'll see you over at the dance later. Thank you very much. This is "Thorny" Thornwell. What a joy it is to be here at the very spot where I first dreamed of becoming your Channel 9 weatherman. I've got a few announcements to make this evening. We've got some real treats coming up. Hey, what are you doing, man? You look good, Newbomb. Maybe you'll get a date. It's an improvement. Hey, Riding Hood, wanna be eaten by the Big Bad Wolf? Fuck you, Newbomb. You told her, didn't you? You told her, didn't you? You set me up, didn't you? We didn't set you up. What time does Dudley get here? Relax, he'll be here in a few minutes, okay? Mother, please. What is it? I have to practice that. That's why I'm singing it. Yes, but your singing in no way corresponds with my fingering. Oh, well. Now, you'll receive the check at the rally. I know. They just wanted you to come by and say "thank you" in person. I know. After all, $500 covers a full year's tuition. Mother, I know! Yes. Now we're gonna stop for a little cherry pie. No. I'm not hungry. Yeah, well, you need a little quick energy. Mother, they always laugh at me at that restaurant when I'm dressed like this. This is so crazy. Oh, Nevans. And now it's my great pleasure to introduce the president of the Beverly Hills Residents' Association and a great American, Jack Friedman. Thank you, Thorny. What's the weather like up there? Well, I'm sure we're all gonna have a good time tonight. And I'm not going to make any long speeches. I'm just going to, uh... All right. I'm just going to start off by introducing a wonderful organization of fine young people. The Beverly Marching Band! Get it up! Take it up! Where's the security, goddamn it? Do the other thing. The other thing? You know. Come here. The other thing? Yeah. Heavens, Nevans! Mrs. Friedman? Mrs. Friedman. Is that you? What are you doing here alone? I had some thinking to do, Dudley. It's fortuitous that I found you here alone because I wanted to ask your advice on which magic trick I should do for the talent contest. Oh, Dudley, I'm not a good judge of magic tricks. I was thinking of doing my big illusion, producing a rabbit from an empty box. Abracadabra, and here it is. Oh, it's a cute little rabbit. I call him Squeakums. I think the audience will find him amusing. I think they will too. Do that trick. Or else I could do... They're waiting for you inside. This is called my three-ball trick. You put these balls in between your fingers, and you make a magic... Oh! Oh! I'm sorry. That's all right. I'll get them. They're down here somewhere. Oh, thank you very much. Mrs. Friedman, what are these? Are these yours, Mrs. Friedman? Yes, they're my husband's pants, and I'm taking them to the cleaners. Then it's a lucky thing I dropped by because I can feel a wallet and keys in the pocket. Dudley, put the pants down, please. Yes, ma'am. Did I do that? I'm sorry! Dudley, please leave! Please just leave! Thank you! The horn is stuck. Jesus! The little son of a bitch. Excuse me, ladies, did you hear about the guy with the five penises? His pants fit like a glove. Oh, you piece of trash. Disgusting. Great joke. Great joke. Turn that song up, man. That's my favorite song. Wait a minute, man, wait a minute. I want you guys to look at me, all right? Who do I look like? I have no idea. Yeah? Look at me, all right? I'm depressed. Who do I look like? You look like that asshole at the car wash. Why don't you bite my weenie, man? I look like James Dean. Don't I? Hey, I gotta take a leak, okay? Hey, aim away from the car, weenie. On behalf of my mother and my father, I'd like to thank the Beverly Hills Residents' Association for their generous award honoring my... Help me! Help me! Help me! Relax. It's me, it's Newbomb. It's okay. Everything's copasetic. May I have my puffer, please? Give him his puffer. Give me his coat. Thank you. Please don't hurt me. I think I'm a bleeder. Mama! Mama! I won't tell anybody. Just don't hurt me. It's me. It's me. It really is. I would like to introduce now three fine young ladies. The Beverly Hills cheerleaders, with their rendition of "Razzle Dazzle. " You forgot your underwear! Your underwear! No underwear on. Clark, this is so fine. That's Newbomb's car, isn't it? Yeah. And that's a fire hydrant, right? Oh, yeah.

So, what do you wanna do? I don't know what I wanna do. I just know what I don't wanna do. I mean, maybe that's what I'm asking for, is just a little time to figure it out. A place to do it, somebody to do it with. I was thinking about Venice. A little apartment down there about a block from the beach. You're asking me to just walk away from it for some pipe dream. Pipe dream? Talk about a pipe dream. Tell me what acting is. Hey, you wanna go to the beach with me tomorrow? Duke, you know I have my screen test in the morning. Yeah. I forgot.

This is his pie wagon. Where is he? Uh, him and Simpson are working on Simpson's rail job. Oh, okay. Hey, Turk. Your car looks really bitchen.

Goddamn these machines. They never work. What are we doing here anyway? What are we doing here? We are looking for cute guys. Cute? Like that Newbomb Turk? I bet that's cute. Can you imagine having to kiss that face? Did you see Thunder Thighs over there with Sally? What a slut. Speaking of sluts, did you hear about Jean Friedman? What? She had an abortion in Tijuana. That doesn't surprise me. I heard she gave half the football team the clap. They played like they still had it last week too.

I want a Big One! I'm so sick and tired of those shitty Ding-Dongs, man! I know, you gotta lay off that surfer food. It'll do you in. Hey, you should talk. Hey, why don't you guys come down to the beach sometime? I'll show you a boss time. No, thanks. Sticking my head in a bunch of seaweed is not my idea of a bitchen time. Try it sometime. Might do you some good. Hey, this is Jane, and this is Cheetah. Wait a second. You're Jane, you're Cheetah. And what are their names? Eyes off. Hey, dummy up, man. And my name is Newbomb Turk. Hey, Turk! How you doing, man? Good, good. Okay. Hey, where's the Duker and Jimmy Shine? Who knows? Who cares? Where's your deuce coupe? It's at the old man's shop, all covered up. I'm thinking about selling it. What for? You've been working on it for about three years. But I've just been hanging out at the beach, crashing in this woody. What do you do for money? Old man takes care of me. He's giving me all the money I want so long as I stay away from the house. He thinks I do more damage if I show up there. What? Need a pair of pliers for those? Just got my damn shirt caught in it. Hey, pencil dick, what time is it? Time to eat! Okay. All right. Chinese bandits, 2 o'clock! Bounces pretty good, pal. Duke might've got whupped by them almond-eyes guys, but I'm going home to get my rail job, and I'm gonna leave them... I'm with you, man. You know the power of that car. Those Chinese assholes. They sneak up on you. That Cobra ain't shit anyway. Hey, he came in second. "But he came in second. " Ha! Thanks a lot. I see you guys are having a good time tonight, huh? And it's gonna get a lot better later. Okay, asshole, pull this yellow piece of shit around the corner here. You got me? Hear that? Move it. Right now, asshole. Hey, Officer Clark, are you lost or something? Bitchen. Do me a favor. Jimmy Shine's going off to Vietnam tomorrow, and you're worried about the beach is bitchen. Who's got the burger? I got a burger. What are you doing, Newbomb? Get your... I was just getting some burger. Oh, you were getting some burger, huh? Well, you want a little shake to go along with your burger? Hey, watch out, man! You know what? I think the guys are weenies for not letting us in the dance. But I could care less, man. I didn't want to go to that stupid dance. I think dancing's for queers anyway. This song is bitchen. Check this song out. Look, I'm telling you, man. The Knights are not breaking up, all right. Suppose Jimmy Shine doesn't come back from Vietnam. Oh, man, don't worry about Jimmy Shine. There's not even a war going on. He's going over for training. What about Duke? Duke can take care of himself. And Shorty, man. Shorty's going to college. Look, don't worry about Shorty. We're gonna stick together, all right? You can cruise with me, man. All right? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of you. Come on, man. Let's get this stuff out of here, you know. What do they have in this? They got the punch in here. Gentlemen, are you from the caterers? Yeah. Of course you are. Is that the punch? Uh-huh. Oh, no, no. Please put it down. You're going the long way. Take the shortcut. Cut right across the lawn. Go right across the lawn through the nice hibiscus. I don't think the gardener's gonna like that come Monday morning. They're gonna re-landscape Monday morning. They're having a new library there. The Newbomb Turk Memorial Library. Newbomb Turk. You've heard of him. Oh, yeah, I know that guy. You heard of him? Yeah, sure. I assure you, there's nothing wrong. You can leave the punch here. Uh, garon! Garon. Boy, boy, boy. Take this punch down there. It'll be our pleasure to take care of this. Anything happens, give them my name. It's okay. Fine. Have a nice time. Thanks a lot for taking care of things. My pleasure, my pleasure. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. This one is for Tubby's. Gentlemen, let's spike the punch. Hey, can I help you? This is the punch for the Beverly Hills Residents' Association. Name? No name. Just punch. Don't drink the punch. Hey, don't drink the punch. Don't drink the punch, man. You little son of a bitch. Hey, you thirsty? Why don't you have some punch? Stay away from the punch. Like some more? No, thanks, it's fine. Well, trick or treat. You're already a treat. You're already a trick. This doesn't taste right. Yeah, it's good. No, it's not right. My dick is in the punch! I've had this taste in my mouth before. It tastes all right to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, hi. Little bastards. I'm just gonna ignore them. I'm not paying attention to them. There's a young man out there. My dick! My dick! I believe he's looking for somebody called Dick. Is there a Dick here? I've got it, Nevans. It's spiked. They've spiked the punch. Thorny, get those officers. Now, I know this taste. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My dick. What seems to be the problem, ma'am? Officer, taste this. Taste this. Tell me what you think. Does have a little wang in it. Good, though. Excuse me. Mind if I have some more? No, no, please. Thank you. Help yourself. Come on, Nevans. Try and get a piece of fruit there. You've gotta be very careful, Dudley. You're a marked man. I'll be fine. They're envious of you. Which trick should I do? They're all so good. Well, stick to your music, dear. Watch the road. After the talent contest, I want you to go right home. I'm gonna drop you at the rear entrance. With more atomic power, "In the Midnight Hour. " Man, this sure is a funny place to build a library. Yeah. Newbomb Turk. You know what? I think I heard of that guy before. He had something to do with something in Beverly Hills or something, man. Yeah. Maybe he's the one giving the money to build the library. Yeah, you're probably right. Hold it, man. Don't drink all that beer. I got you covered. Just come on. What should we do? Just drive the truck through here. I would like to get home tonight. Well, here goes nothing. That... That... That car! I told you not to come in here! You killed my flowers! That man in the parking lot told us to come down here. The man that's having the memorial library built. Oh, no! That rich guy over there. Who did this? Told us about Newbomb Turk. Newbomb Turk did this! I know! Newbomb, that asshole! Oh, Dudley. Dudley, come here. We want to show you something. - I... I... I... - Dudley, come over here. Come on. Dudley, I want to show you something. Come here, Dudley. I want to show you something. Come here. Dudley, look. Dudley, are you okay? Oh, yes. Oh, good. It's gonna be all right. Newbomb, is that you again? Yeah, Dudley. Sorry. Nothing personal. I understand, I think. Please be careful with the cape. I will. It's rented. Have a beer, buddy. I hope you win the contest. Thanks, Dud, that's sweet. Watch your head, bye. Well done, ladies. Uh-uh, I... Hey, hey, hey. You can do it. I can do it. My boy. Hello? One, two? Did you hear about Jean Friedman? She had an abortion in Tijuana. They're talking about my daughter! I'm not surprised. I heard she gave half the football team the clap. They were playing like it last week too. That was Brenda and Shirley Weintraub, the Iron Box Twins, coming to you live from the ladies' room at Tubby's Drive-In this Halloween night. But I cannot function without my glasses or my puffer. Dudley, would you just relax and stay put? I'll be back in a few minutes with my rail job. Don't forget me. I won't forget you. Just stay put. Because I'm a little scared. There's nothing to be scared of. Stay put. So let's welcome, please, um... He's a wonderful one-armed... Uh, one-armed violinist. Mr... Mr. Sasha Du... Da... Mr. Sasha Dabinsky, the one-armed violinist. Let's welcome him. I presume that must be... Well... The one-armed violinist. It's impossible! He grabbed it with his dick! Stop applauding! Stop applauding! Stop applauding! Making fun of handicapped people... Excuse me. Making fun of handicapped people is not my idea of a joke. There may be people laughing, but I'm telling you, we can fight. They may be laughing now, but they'll be laughing... ...out the other side of their faces in the morning when we start tearing down that social disease of Beverly Hills! Tubby's is gonna be torn down! He grabbed it with his dick! I beg your pardon, sir. I miss your big Buick. Oh, that's great. Here. Oh, I love it. God, you feel great. Don't mess my hair up, though. Honey, I didn't touch your hair. Oh, shit. Hello? Hello. Oh, hello. Excuse me, I'm lost. Could you show me the way to the dance? It's way over there. Yes, over that way. Mrs. Friedman? Mrs. Friedman! Oh, Dudley, you... Hello. Get my clothes. Oh, shit. Look. We're all in our underwear. You know, I'm a real nice girl. I've got the best reputation in our high school. I heard about your reputation. Mike, I can't do it. That's all right. You can't get pregnant this way. I'm not that type of girl. You can't get pregnant. Okay. Okay. Right there. How's that? How's that? Faster! Faster! Oh, God! It's caught in the zipper! No! Get away! Oh, don't touch it! Don't touch it! Let it go down! I gotta wait. No, I just gotta wait till the swelling goes down! Dark, you are like a dead putz. I mean, this is a party. We're supposed to have fun, music, pastrami. What's wrong with you? Turk, come over here. Now, he happens to be very hysterically funny. I put him right up there with Steve and Eydie. He has more talent in his little pinkie than you have in your whole pinkie. Why don't you just go blow? I mean, you make me nauseous. High school girls. I should have known better. Humpf. You know, you have impeccable taste. Listen, I'm having a party at my house. Uh... You wanna take me? To the pie wagon. On a beautiful Halloween night, 1965, with Dr. J. On the burner! Go. Go. Okay. Oh, Turk. Turk. Oh, Turk. Turk, I'm ready. Come here, Turk. This is just like in the movies. Oh, I'm wearing my mother's musk-scent perfume. Oh, Turk. Turk, come back here. Come on, before I lose the feeling, Turk. Turk, come on. Turk? Turk? Come on, Turk. Come back here. Come on. Um... Come on, Turk. What? It's not right. What? It's not right. What's not right? The mood's not right. What do you mean? What do you mean? I'm in the mood! I'm ready. I'm hot. I'm ready to go. Come on! I'm all hot and bothered! Are you kidding me? Turk! Did you come? Turk. Turk. What? Did you come? A little. A little? What do you mean? Either you came or you didn't! Did you come or not? I came. Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed. I came. I came. Give me my shirt back. Oh, my God! You came! I can't believe it! You are so immature. I am not immature! I came. It happens. I'm sorry it happened. Who does it happen to? It's all very personal. I'm glad I came. You know that? I'm glad I came. I really am. God, are you something! This is the engine of the future. In a VW. Funny. There's only six of those in the country. Yeah, but Nader's gonna stop all this. There won't be no more. Yeah, I'm afraid you're right. If that's Sharon, tell her I've gone. Guys, let's do this another night. Kiss my ass. He's already gone. You sure you wanna see this? What, are you crazy? Come on. Let's do it. Is this piss yellow? That's Tony Nancy yellow. Hey, Jimmy, check this out. Laz was over here today rubbing this thing out. His back went, and Al came in and finished it. Hey, he did a good job. Phew. Man. Hey, who put the tune on it? - Fiasco. - Boy, does it run sweet. Tony, what about that other thing? What other thing? You know. The thing. Hey, what's the deal? It's a little going-away present, Jim, from the Knights and the guys here at the shop, they all chipped in. Junior put it in. Ahead of the headlines, this is the 1 a. m. Edition of KBLA News, presented by the car of the future, Studebaker. Come on, come on. Let's get those tires in the van and let's split, brother. We'll never get back by 2, man. Forget it. Damn, look at your car. Where the hell are my tires? Get them! Why do these guys singing rock 'n' roll have to wear those kind of glasses? God, it's gonna be weird living back in New York. What's wrong, Suzie? Duke getting you crazy? I don't know. He go to the dance without you? I guess so. That's the way it goes. Yeah. He'll probably be back later when I close the place and have a beer. Guy's being tough on you, huh? What time's the screen test tomorrow? Seven. Don't let it bother you. Be good tomorrow. Thanks. Hey, Jimmy, what time do you have to leave tomorrow? I gotta be up at 6. Dee Dee's waiting for me. I gotta get over there. She's cooked a roast. We're gonna drink a bottle of champagne. We'll go to Santa Monica pier and watch the sun come up. Hey, that sounds like pretty romantic stuff to me. Hey, I remember one time, I was in Okinawa. Me and this buddy of mine named Grease... Best damn mechanic I ever seen. Anyway, me and Grease took this Thunderbolt engine out of a crate, modified that son of a bitch and put it in a little jeep. I mean, they was having a parade that day. I mean, MacArthur and his whole hot-damn staff were there, man. Anyway, me and this Grease got in that jeep and we blew by that parade. Oh, shit, man. It must've been 150 miles an hour. MPs are still looking for us. They found the jeep. They only suspected it was us. What happened to Grease? That son of a bitch got drunk and drove a command car into an ammo dump and the whole thing went up, and they never did find nothing. War's funny, huh? Hey, listen. I wanna say something. Um... If something happens to me while I'm gone... I don't know, anything. - I don't want that the car should... Well, Dee Dee wouldn't know what to do with it and... I want the car should go to the club. You know, all the guys. Hell, that was the big one. Vietnam's nothing like that. I know, I know, I know, but I'm just saying, just in case. Hey, listen, nothing's gonna happen. Let's get some beers. This is Dr. J. On KBLA, the boss with the hot sauce. I'm gonna tell you something. This is for lovers only. This is for everybody up on Mulholland Drive. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to put one hand on the radio and the other hand wherever you feel it should be. And that's exactly where you're putting me on Halloween night, 1965. For lovers only. We'll never make it back. It's after 1:00. Hey, how you doing? See if they'll help us. How you doing, Mrs. Johnson? Maybe these guys will help us. Hey, let's ask them. Hey, what's going on? We need you guys to do us a favor. We're trying to get into this car gang in Beverly Hills. They dropped us here, took our clothes and left us four spare tires. We gotta get to Hollywood by 2:00. It's an initiation. But we need a dedication in that record store from the disc jockey. You guys gotta do us a big favor and make a dedication. Okay. What you want? The song is "Heat Wave. " Gotta get it on by 2:00, and if you can, try to get him to say something like, "To anyone who ever cruises Tubby's. " Right. Tubby's, huh? Tubby's, all right? "Cruises Tubby's," all right? My brother Willy T. Here has the best. We kind of gotta go. If you're ever in the neighborhood, come on over for lox and bagels. You cats smoke any of this shit before? Oh, yeah, we smoke that stuff all the time. Check this out, man. That'll put a hem in your dress. You'll love it. It is a killer. Hold it in, right? Hold it in. It's a killer, isn't it? Give me a hit of that, man. From the desert to the sea, soulfully. Please let me hold you. No, I'm all right. No, you're not. What you need is a good hot sauna and a massage. Yeah, maybe you're right. And you're not mad no more? No. No, I'm all right. One more call about those Knights, your ass is in the meat grinder. Listen, I don't know what you've been doing all night, but you're gonna have the lieutenant all over your butts tomorrow. There was a kidnapping at the pep rally. And somebody farted their way around the gym at show time. Then you two end up assaulting an honor student. Then the lawn over at the country club dance was torn up. Somebody urinated in the refreshments, played a lewd recording over the PA. Then somebody went on-stage and stuck his finger out in place of his dick or something. I've never seen anybody as asleep at the wheel as you two have been tonight. Now, wake up! You get it? Hey, Newbomb, where's your El Camino? Asshole. That guy is such an asshole. What the hell did you say? What the hell did you say?! I said, "It's cold. Brrr. Real cold. " That son of a bitch. He usually goes to the can about now. I got an idea. I got an idea. I'm gonna get this asshole. Shorty! I'll really get this asshole. Tarzan. Tarzan, come here for a second. Listen, go to the head. Take a roll of toilet paper. Shove it all the way in. Stuff it up. I don't want anything coming up. You got your screwdriver? Got it? Yeah, I got it. Go to Brother Earle's and get a potato, an unpeeled potato. Hey, dumb-ass, get over there! What the hell...? I want to get a chip. You got this crap all over me. You want a chip? Here's a damn chip. Hey, Iron Box! Don't you think I'd look good in a mustache? Yeah. You'd look better than good. You'd look perfect, like a perfect horse's ass. You're just jealous, that's all. I'm gonna go take a whiz. Just make sure you wash your hands, all right? Just don't slam the door, okay? You're gonna spill my milk. Clark... Oh, shit! Holy shit. Come on, hurry. Hurry! This one's for Tubby's. "Where's your El Camino? Where's your El Camino?" Officer Bimbeau! Oh! Oh... Oh, shit! Hey, Clark! Clark! Hey! Clark! Clark! Bimbeau? Bimbeau! Clark, come on! I'm in here! What's going on? What? I'm locked in here! Okay. All right. Get back, Bimbeau! Clark! Clark! Clark! You asshole! Clark! Get up there. What's the matter with you? What the hell were you doing? I gotta get my shoe! Get your shoe! Look at my new shoes! You look wonderful. That was funny. That was real funny. It was wonderful. It was just... It was great. Help! Help! Help! Get back! Give him air! Shut up! Shut your mouth! This punk is drunk! Get your ass up! He's not drunk. He's the honor student. He's having an epileptic fit! Do something! A fit? Put something in his mouth. He'd swallow his tongue. Shove the nightstick in his mouth. No! No! No! No! No! No! I'm fine. I'm all right. He's up! It's a miracle! Your lights. Your lights. You didn't turn on your lights. Your lights. Your lights. Now look what you did. Look what you did. What? What in the hell are you talking...? Why are you riding shotgun for? I'm not driving. You are. You go to sleep in the back seat. You're supposed to be watching out! Let me drive! Blow him away. Go! Way to go, weenie! Hey. Take care of this until I get back home, okay? For me? Well, you earned it. Put it on, man. Thanks, man. What about the pledges we left in Watts? What about those guys? Where are they? It's 2:00 in the morning. Maybe we should go get them. Wait. We're...? We're going to go to Watts at 2:00 in the morning? Let's go. Ah, what the hell. Hey, everybody! Beer's on the house! What are they gonna do, close us down, Smitty? How was the dance? I don't know. I didn't go. Where you been? Out there. How was it? It's okay. Don't shut me out. Hey, you know, I can handle blowing the screen test... as long as I don't blow it with you. I just gotta say I was there. I'm just asking you for a chance to fail. Listen... I'm not afraid of you failing. But, uh... I guess what I'm really afraid of is, if you make it, I won't be good enough for you. I love you. Crystals, baby, and "Uptown. " This is your brother Dr. J. On KBLA, approaching the 2 a. m. Hour. Dr. J. DR. J: What's happening? This is June Bug, Willy T. How you doing? Hey, man. What's up? We got this dedication. Some pledges on the corner... Right here? Yeah. Right there. They want this on the radio? Yeah. You got it. They requested it for a car club. Okay, okay. I'm gonna take care of it. There's a place over there on Wilshire Boulevard. Everybody knows it. It's called Tubby's Drive-In. And you know what? Tonight is the last night it's gonna be around. They're busting it down. Can you believe it? Here's the request. There's a group of guys out there, they got a car club. They more or less own the place. And it's called the Hollywood Knights. Tonight they had a bunch of pledges come down... ...here to get a request on the radio, right here, at exactly 2 a.m., and that's what I'm gonna do for them. I can't think of a better way to end this show on this Halloween night, 1965, than with Martha & The Vandellas talking about "Heat Wave. " Look, the little sons of bitches made it. Kiss my ass. See you in spring. Look out after my old lady, huh? Listen, I'm doing the right thing. Be careful, huh? Take care of yourself. Don't forget to write. You all right? Yeah. I'm a little scared. Hell, who isn't? You've been like a dad to me. Hey, listen, I don't want you hot-rodding any jeeps. That's Dee Dee. I gotta go. Take care. Hey, I'll send you those magazines. Hey, Wheatly. Halloween's over. Why don't you take off the mask? What? Why don't you bite my weenie, chump? I don't know what's gonna be. Soon I'll be going away to college. I'll probably never see you again. Hey, you're going to UCLA. Hello? Hello, Mother? This is Dudley. Dudley! Mother, I'm calling to inform you that I'm going to be out rather late tonight. You're not in bed, dear? In fact, I might not be home at all. Mother, I have an assignation with a young lady tonight. I am going to explore the boundaries of my manhood. I see, dear. Mother, I'm going to get laid. You're going to be a little late. Not late, Mother. Laid. L-A-I-D. The past participle of the verb "to lay. " I'm going to screw someone. Now I've got to find out how. Excuse me. Honey, are you okay? I got a little heartburn. You know, I think that somebody did put something in that punch. There was something in it. Yeah, I think you're right. Now I feel a little funny myself. That taste keeps coming up. Let's go, pretty boy. I guess we finally got rid of those little pissants. You bet. We really whupped their ass tonight. Bimbeau! Kiss his ass! Bullshit! Look out. It's okay. It's okay. Honey, I don't feel safe here. Your husband is right in that house. Right there. Don't worry about a thing. He's dead drunk. He's passed out. It'd take an earthquake to wake him up. Don't worry about him. Don't worry about anything. I'm not. Don't worry. I don't even care anymore. Rock 'n' roll! Rock 'n' roll! Get out! It might explode! That son of a bitch hit this son of a bitch. Clark! You're supposed to be riding shotgun! You're supposed to look out for me! I'm looking! Jacqueline? Bob? Jack... Honey, the strangest thing just happened! We were talking and... They knocked my pants off, and... I'm going for the police now and... We were just... - We were talking in the car. Don't just stand there! Do something! I can't believe that this shit has happened to me tonight. Mrs. Friedman! You assholes!
