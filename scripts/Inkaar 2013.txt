I want to bat. I want to bat. OK. You're next. OK. You're next. What is yours... what belongs to you... ...if someone doesn't give it to you, then snatch it. Understand? Yeah, K. K, of course I'm coming for the meeting. You handle Rahul. I'm a professional. See you. The caravan of life, with countless desires. Filled with pride, always trying to exceed yourself. Yeah, mom. There is no problem. It's nothing I can't handle. The caravan of life, with countless desires. Hi. And I am 30 seconds late. - Shall we begin? - Let's start. A some point in life you've got to try. But there's no gurantee that you get lucky each time. Tina! But, if there is someone watching your back. Then you can try, and try, without a worry. Prima One, Health Insurance. Live carefree. - Very nice. - It's really nice. You like it? It's a bit edgy, but... ...without that you would be lost. I liked it. In fact, I think it rocks. - What say, guys? - Great. Actually, some of the best copyrighters... ...of our agency worked on this campaign. That means Maya worked on it personally. And she is the best. - Right, Maya! - Of course. Yeah, of course. 'You two are a great team.' The caravan of life, the countless desires. Filled with pride, always trying to exceed yourself. You're the boat and the storm. You're the question and the answer. Why do you burn like the lamp in the storm? What do you think I'm looking at right now? Here they come? My, God. You look nervous. Hello, Mrs. Kaamdar. I'll introduce you to our chairman. Mr. K.K. This is Mrs. Kaamdar. - Shall we? - Alright. I asked Shefali to give me your meeting schedule... ...and I'll handle everything. Don't worry, I'll fill in for you. Coffee? Coffee... Thank you. Mrs. Kaamdar, the committee head has arrived. So you won't withdraw your complaint, will you? These files are ready to be dispatched to Delhi. Courier them. And the meeting with Akon. Confirm it for the day after tomorrow. Okay. So, shall we begin this Rahul v/s Maya case, KK? What did she say then? I told you she won't listen. The caravan of life, the countless desires. Filled with pride, trying to exceed yourself. You're the boat and the storm. You're the question and the answer. Why do you burn like the lamp in the storm? Why do you burn? Sexual harassment. I would've never imagined that I'd see this day. I've been with this company for 10 years. All of you here know me personally. So what do you think? You think I could ever sexually harass anyone? Force someone into something? Or trouble anyone? What do you think, Mr. Gupta? Well, I never had a need for sexual harassment. But, let's continue with this formality. Kavita? Nimmi? You never ever harassed me. Unfortunately. Aul, you're the head if HR. Did you ever hear anything like this about me? No. Mrs. Kaamdar, you're an outsider in this committee. And as a social worker... ...you would have come across many cases like this. What do you think? Look, Rahul. Maya Luthra has filed an official complaint against you. Of sexual harassment. So you have to speak. You need to give the answers. Well, then. Here's my answer. I never needed to resort to such a thing, nor will I ever. All the allegations in this complaint are baseless. They are lies. If it's a lie, it's baseless, then why would Maya... ...press such serious allegations against you. I mean, it'll only give a bad name to everyone. To her, to you, to the agency. I don't get it. Well then... Let her answer this question. The caravan of life, the countless desires. Of course he'll deny it. Of course he'll say I'm lying. I don't know whether he needed it or not. But the fact is, that he is harassing me. It's a cinch for him to turn the tables, Mrs. Kaamdar. That's his job. From the outside Rahul-Maya, great team, professional. But the filth, the mental torture that I've to endure... ...isn't something that I can explain to you here.' It's getting too difficult to work here. This is becoming impossible. Hey, leave. We're already quite tensed-up here. Leave. Even, the way these peons look at me... ...when I enter the office, it's hard to explain. And he denies it!? Somebody... Please give her a glass of war. I'm fine. Okay, just calm down. I know it's... not easy for you. But... it's important for us to know... ...where it all started. When did this all begin? I don't remember correctly. But, maybe if I think, then perhaps during the Goa fest? For the final award of the year... Those days I was working for the agency's New York office. And came directly to Goa for this event. Around seven years later. Sir, come forward. No, I'm fine here. I'll sit with Praful. Award for the best campaign of the year... goes to... Goes to KK and Doyle. We did it guys. First of all, I would like to thank... ourselves. Because no one liked the campaign that we suggested... ...and everyone was against it. But... we kept at it. And that is why we're here today. Right, guys. Another, very important person... ...I would like to thank today. ...without whom I wouldn't be standing here today. I would like to thank... John Doyle. Masterstroke. Thank you so much. It's because of you I am here. ...a performance by Goa's own... Mambo. Congratulations! - Thanks. I... I didn't know you were here. I forgot to thank you. - Oh, come on. - Sorry. So since when did a need for 'thank you' come between us. In fact, so what else has come up between us? Oh, so you want to know everything right now? Gradually. Slowly. - So how was New York? - It was nice. - Must've been, you look great. - Thanks. Really. By the way, I've got a gift for you. I've got something for you from New York. Remind me, okay. I'll come over to your room tonight... to remind you. Shut up. Maya isn't here so I thought you should know. That same day, the senior management... ...was discussing her career. He knows. - He was expecting a promotion. - Please. Don't remind me of that day. It is indeed a great idea to have Maya on the board. Of course it is. This past six months in New York... ...she has proved her worth. And what's more, the clients love her. You guys just keep talking about Rahul this, Rahul that. Listen, we cannot run an agency centred around one person. - Absolutely. - Maya is the right choice. Okay. So let's call her... ...I am leaving tomorrow. Kavita. Call Maya, please. - Just Maya. - Okay. What the hell. Gupta, party's begun, huh? I am bloody sorry. It's okay. Lets go lets go. - So when are you joining? - Very soon. - In fact on Monday. - Really? That soon? That's fast... Hey, guys. The award's been handed out... ...so we need to celebrate as well. - Exactly. What do you say? How sweet. Chosen by words, woven by words. Everything we said, everything we heard. I didn't have a clue, neither did you. Wonder where the words made a mistake. The words try to say something unsaid. The words try to narrate something unheard. They wounded the heart. Words decieved the words itself. Maya. Silence is trying to speak out. You are okay na! Yes, but where were you? I was stuck at the gate. How are you. I told them that I'm Maya's boyfriend, but they still stopped me at the gate. I'll get you towel. So then what happened in the swimming pool was harassment? It was? Wasn't? Was? Wasn't? I don't know, ma'am. But since you're the expert, you tell me. When the woman is not liking the flirtation... ...then it could be harassment. - Really. Depends on the woman. So tell me then, Mrs. Kaamdar... ...where's the fine line between flirting and harassment? Otherwise, this way anyone can say anything. Right? Maybe you haven't the slightest idea, Mrs. Kaamdar. But you're looking stunning in that green sari. - Okay. I get the point. So now what? Did you like it or not? Was that flirting or harassment? Are you going to sue me? Come on, flirting is fun goddammit. And we're in an advertising agency. ...work together for 20 hours a day, selling what? Condoms. Sanitary napkins. Lingerie. If they can't joke with one another... ...it'll become too serious an environment. And this agency won't sell a product. As for Maya? I don't know. When did she feel it was harassment? She didn't say anything at all then. I let it go then, because... because we were friends. It did feel slightly uncomfortable, but... ...you know, we were friends. I trusted him. I believed him so... ...I let it go. Oh, so it's about trust and belief now? Its funny. There was trust all these years... ...and now it's suddenly broken? And in whom? The person because of who she's in this agency? I don't get it. You know who actually placed trust in whom? And the award for the best ad film of the year goes to. KK Advertising. To present the award may I call upon Mr. Ghosh. Looser... It's all fixed. It's been rigged. Loosers... Of course, that was my award. They cheated... They don't deserve it. I'll have two drinks. Two drinks, please. - Hello. - Hi and piss off! I'm too upset right now. Why? Because you didn't get the award? Rahul Verma. I am never going to get a job in advertising now, right? But... our campaign was better. Much better. Hello Maya. I will just be back. He's had too much while celebrating his victory. - Congratulate him. - Oh, my God! Give me your hand. - Are you falling intentionally? - Who knows? So... was my campaign really that bad? - Frankly speaking... it was pathetic. - Why? A few of your friends might have liked it... ...but you forgot all about the product. Have a real drink. So why is that? Because... I don't work for you, right? Maybe. So are you... offering me a job? I never said that. But maybe, few months later when you're sober again... ...and you want to work seriously, then let's see. That's me. Okay, but I am not that type. I won't sleep with you. Hey babes, what are you doing here? - Come on Let's dance... - I was just getting a drink... Come on. It wasn't the just the job... ...I was like the 'fairness cream' in her life. Meaning? The Doors open. A girl from Solan. In the big city. A VT station. Lost, scared. But she had determination, talent. All she needed was direction and focus. Cut. He comes. He sees. 'That's me.' Takes her under his wing. 'But I am not that type.' Excuse me? Could you tell me where Rahul Verma is? The question is... ...does Rahul Verma knows where he is? He taught her to walk. How to walk, how to speak, how to dress... ...how to sell her ideas. And at the end the rooster will say to the child... One, two, three, four... Let's brush our teeths. Let's brush away those germs. Let's make those teeth stronger. Come on, man. Do you like it? It's nonsense. It's bullshit. What writing? Cock-a-doodle-doo. It took you three months to write this? There's a thought behind this actually. - I mean, I... - What? That you stammer? I can see your confidence. My thought on this is... ...I shit ideas like this every morning. Maybe, I'll get toilet paper from tomorrow. Anyway... It's rubbish (old film song) It's rubbish. Rahul. It's a good campaign. We're selling children's toothpaste... ...so it has to be in-tune with the children? - It's too late. - Meaning? I mean it was a good idea. But if the client calls it crap... ...will you start stammering during the presentation? They'll scrap a good campaign. There's no dearth of good ideas in this world. Learn to save your ideas. So you're giving me a lesson on handling clients. Not just clients, life too. Please, don't screw this presentation, okay. More confidence. Cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a-doodle-doo. And then the baseline appears... ...with the pack, pearly whites. All day long, Cock-a-doodle-doo. I am not saying, but I think... ...it'll go over the top of the children's heads. Ramlal? Sir, chickens only lay eggs. But I think this is crap. I'm not saying. Sir, we were thinking... ...since this is children's toothpaste... ...it should have a kids tune. So, it'll stick. But, Rahul, why are we changing the campaign now? I'll tell you why this campaign is better. You see a lot of ads on television. Which one do you remember? - Fevicol. Heave ho... - Good. Good. Very good. Why? Because it's different. In this horde of media, to stand out... ...you will have to do something different. But, I am not saying you're right... ...but you're right, but I am not saying. But what's the guarantee? Guarantee? Fine, our agency takes the guarantee. If this campaign doesn't succeed... ...we'll return all that you spend on the media. I am not saying, you're not saying. See I am just saying but if you're saying. What choice do we have at this stage? Okay. Great guys. A ray of sunlight falls on the product... ...and that same ray touches her face. And now her face's glowing. She is confident. She is ready... to take on the world. That was my effect on her. Mrs. Kaamdar, if I can sell you age-defying cream... ...then of course I can make a small-town girl... ...the national creative head of this agency. Of course he taught me everything. In fact, he taught me everything I know. And yet, here I am, sitting before you. But does that mean that every time he walks in... ...I just spread my legs. ...'come, Mr. Rahul. Enjoy yourself'. Is he recovering a debt? Do I have to repay him? What else will you call it... ...other than taking undue advantage, Mrs. Kaamdar. Undue advantage? Is that what she said? Who actually benefited from this relationship... ...you all know... What... what was he saying? He was trying to say something, right? Kavita, he should've said it. - Oh my God. Look who's here? - Hi. - Sonali, how are you? - I am good and you? So, what are you doing here? For some work. Rahul. Shall we go? I'll catch you later. Ok. - Come on, let's have some coffee. - Yeah sure. - Yes, Rahul. - We've a problem. I'm coming to your room. What's wrong? The other agency, who are pitching for the same campaign? Their creative director Sonali, I met her in the lobby. And... in a weak moment... ...she showed me her entire campaign. - What did you do? - Nothing. I mean we just had coffee. I swear. - Just coffee? - Really? Ok. But the problem is... ...our campaigns are too similar. - They are almost the same. - How is that possible? Yeah. And we've got to change our entire campaign... ...by tomorrow morning because... ...they will give their presentation today. - Tomorrow morning! - Yeah. I think you need to get ready. So the idea, idea, idea... What's the idea? They're presenting an urban campaign like us, so... So we should do the opposite. We should show them the India they've never seen. Like MP, Bihar... You know, rural India. Saharanpur. Who would buy such a bike in Saharanpur? There are some nice people from Saharanpur as well. - Saharanpur? - What's so funny? Nothing, nothing, nothing. So our hero's from Saharanpur. Opening shot Saharanpur. A father-son enter the showroom... ...and ask the salesman. So how much does she give? - What? - I mean... that's too vulgar. - We... - What do you mean by vulgar... They are talking about petrol mileage. - You've a one track mind. - No. Yeah. That's how people talk there. Like... 'We just have to sit our asses down... ' '... and go from one place to another.' 'Why spend 50,000 for that? ' The father refuses to buy the motorcycle... ...which makes the son upset. Some drama. - That's a bad idea. - No, the Koreans will love it. Close your eyes... and think. It's a technique. What? Actually... I've got an idea. Whoa, so it actually works. Where's the mother in all this? She'll have a say in this decision as well. So the mother gets angry. She says That's enough. I've got some money too. I'll buy that bike for you. That's not how women talk to their husbands in India. Then the mother says Mr. Chaudhary... ...our son is growing up. Think about it. Better. But not so much. I think the mother will say... ...Times have changed, Mr. Chaudhary. Learn to keep up with times. Then... the father understands. - I think this really works. - I think so. That works. - Write it down. - Yeah. Superb. And the last line says... ...'Raaston ko hi nahi Rishton ko bhi jodein'. Which means 'Not just connecting places... '... but connecting... people.' If they don't like it I'll gift you to them. You are already quite decked up as it is. Rahul. It's wonderful. Great. It's great. Superb. Champagne. Rahul. - Yeah. - Come back please for a minute. - Yes. - I want to ask you about how you... Now I'm lost. Lost in love. Shall we get out of here? Now I'm lost. Lost in love. Lost in the crowd. Lost in the path. You go. Go. I was completely lost from reality. That's my wife. My wife, my wife take permission first. - No, no. After two months. Both of you. Oh, God! Love's a unique place. A place for the lovers. Everyone's here. But not you. With these bewitching eyes. I will seduce you. Lord, You're the benefactor. Allah, You're the benefactor. Lord, You're the benefactor. Allah, You're the benefactor. So, by what you're saying, it clearly indicates... ...that she went on a professional assignment... ...and slept with the boss. Two handsome people. Spending quality time with each other... ...and there was sex between them, what else? No, no, no, Mrs. Kaamdar. It wasn't sex. It was not only sex. Maya was in love. Now I'm lost. Lost in love. Now I'm lost. Lost in love. Lost in the crowd. Lost in love. Lost in the path. Lost in love. I was completely lost from reality. Lord, You're the benefactor. Allah, You're the benefactor. Lord, You're the benefactor. Allah, You're the benefactor. Maya told me about this herself. She was so happy. I can't tell you how happy she was. Maya. You... - Are drunk. - No. - Yes. - No, no, no. - I am in love. - What? When? Where? What nonsense. That wasn't right. It's not right. Yeah, very bad. I mean... nothing happened. - Nothing happened. - Nothing happened. Nothing. No, no, it's not Rahul. You're kidding? Maya. Haven't you heard? If you do the boss, you'll be sacked. Mrs. Kaamdar, this wasn't just a sexual relation for Rahul either. I mean... they were shooting somewhere in Simla... ...and he even dropped in at Maya's home. Sister. Sister. Sister. Maya, are you really here to see me... ...or to get me to see Rahul? You always keep calling me to come see you. I am here to see you. - Really. - Really? Really. It's not just me, he's stuck on me too. What... Take the pickle along. He's a nice boy, but he won't marry you. It was a serious relationship, Mrs. Kaamdar... ...which ended. Maybe that's how our profession is. Maybe Rahul wasn't ready for a commitment. Maybe Maya wanted much more. People were uttering nonsense. I mean it was just a mess. Come on, Pamela. Smile. Lift it up. Squeeze it. Squeeze it tight. Yeah come on. Come on. You can do it. Squeeze it. Hi... Cut, cut. Who's that model? I thought we selected someone else? Yes, but Rahul preferred this one. Ma'am. Ma'am, the mango...? Break! Break for lunch. Come on, guys. - Hi, Rahul. - Hey, Maya. - Hi, Kavita. - I will see you later. - Where are you going? - For lunch. Royal China. I love the food there. Have you met Maya? Arvind, our client. Maya's the best copyrighter of our agency. In fact, she's written this ad. - I can see you've a good team, Rahul. - Sure. And that's Pamela, our model. - Hi. - Hi. You want to check the pack-shots? Because they'll just shoot them. Just see that they're shot properly. - Do you need anything? - No, I'm fine. Sure. I wrote a far better script. Maya didn't write it, did she? Yow where Maya gets her scripts approved? - Where? - This is a good one. Rahul and Maya go inside the cabin. I don't know what goes on inside. But when they both come out... Rahul says Ah. It's approved. Now get back to work. What are you saying, man? Oh no. What's wrong with you? - You really sick, Praful. - Did I say anything wrong? Did he say anything wrong? Great. He didn't say anything wrong? - It's a joke, Maya. - It's a joke. - Just relax, it's a joke. - I'm laughing. - Let's laugh. - Serves you right. Serves you right. You can just park the car, I'll be right back. Hey, Rahul. Yes, I am here. Love's a unique place. A place for the lovers. Everyone's here. But not you. With these bewitching eyes. I will seduce you. Lord, You're the benefactor. Allah, You're the benefactor. Lord, You're the benefactor. Allah, You're the benefactor. It was really nice to meet you, Pamela. - You too. Have a safe journey back home. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? I was in the neighbourhood... ...so I thought I'll come and discuss that... Kaira Ltd. Campaign, right. Okay. - I think you're here to gift Rahul mangoes. Alphonso. Right? - It's not what you think. - Sorry, bad jokes. I was leaving anyway. Oh, that's good. Because we've something to discuss. - Yeah Good luck. - Bye. You okay? Thirsty? Yeah. Come. So, Rahul Verma. Two girls in a single day. You can manage. Can't you? Come and get me. Come and get me! Don't do that. - Do it. - Don't do that, Maya. Don't do that, Maya. Why all this? But isn't this what you want? - This is... - Don't do that, Maya. What's wrong with you? Just because a model's visiting my house? This reaction. What do you think? Something happened between us. Why should I give you an explanation? I don't understand, Maya? What's the relation between us? What is it? Are you my girlfriend? Fiance. Would-be wife. You want a commitment. - What do you want? - Nothing. Maya. Come. Give your hand. Come on. Sit down. - Are you hurt? - I'm fine. Let me get a drink. I'm going to Delhi. I am freaking going to Delhi. Rahul. I want to go to Delhi. Delhi? How did this Delhi crop up in this? You know what, Maya? This is not going anywhere. Let's talk tomorrow. Have your drink, let's just relax. I am going to Delhi. Did you hear? I want to go to Delhi, Rahul. And you're going to call KK and tell him... ...to transfer me to Delhi. No, you're going to do that. Are you out of your mind? Do you know what you're saying? There's no future in Delhi. Come on. And all this because a stupid model came to my house. - No! No. Do you know what they say about me at the agency? They say all kinds of crap. What do they say? Whatever I did until now, all my work is because... Because what? - Because I... - Say it, Maya. Say it, come on. Because you're sleeping with Rahul Verma. Because you're sleeping with me. Yes, because I'm sleeping with you. Because I'm sleeping with you. Because I... Maya, people are going to talk. Because they don't have anything else to say. You will call KK. No, I won't call KK. I didn't put in all that effort... ...so that you can just leave me one day. Okay. Then I resign, alright. What the hell? What is wrong with you? - I will resign. - What is wrong with you women? Why are you all so irrational? Sit down. You want me to call KK. I will call KK. Fine. I will call KK. Happy? Let's celebrate. To Delhi. Okay. Happy? Come on, Maya. Don't go to Delhi. Please. Why? Because there's no future there? You can stop thinking about my future. I will handle it. So, they both had an affair and then broke up. Maybe, this isn't a case about sexual harrasment at all. Possible, right. Maybe, Maya filed this case against Rahul only to get revenge. Women can do that right we know that. When woman turns ferocious. They can ruin the world, without batting an eyelid. Kavita, I didn't make this up. Where were you looking at me while saying it? Hell... Listen carefully, Aul. Hell heth no fury. Like a women's scorn. Nimi, what will I do without you? Oh, please. I really really need to get to bottom of this. We've been hearing that you and Rahul shared... Intimate relation. Gupta, stop. - Stop what? - No, just stop it. She can't say it, I'm just helping her out. She'll say whatever she wants to. Enough... What... It is a fact... Just a second. Maya, we've heard that... ...that maybe... maybe you... ...benefited a lot from this relationship. Who said that? If I wanted to take undue advantage, I wouldn't have left. But why Delhi all of a sudden? It was simple. She had become a brand by now. She used me to become the creative head at Delhi. Her motive was fulfilled. So she left. If a man puts an end to a relation... ...everyone says What a honest man. But if a woman does the same thing... ...then her motives are questioned. Opportunity, growth, prospects... ...it's all here, in Mumbai. And I left all this behind and went to Delhi. It wasn't a plan. I was... I was young and... ...I couldn't handle anything at the moment. When Maya returned seven years later... ...and was promoted to the board of directors... ...how did you feel about that? I mean, I heard you weren't too happy about it. I had no doubts that she'll progress. I mean, I taught her everything. What do you think? When she went into the foreigner's room in Goa... ...didn't I know what's going to happen next. Maya, the boys are calling you up, come on. - Now? - Yes, now. Come on. Let me change first. - Okay. - Come on. You know some day I wana be be just like her. Oh, you're so ambitious that you're prepared to do anything. Maya where you going? Tarun, I'll be right back. Please. - My love. - What is it? - How can we celebrate without you? - Maya my dear. Come. Let's dance. What are you up to? The party's just beginning. But, what is it? Paul, you tell me. What is it? Nothing, it's no big deal. They want to woo you... ...by making you the national creative director. And from now, you'll directly handle Digimax and Proton accounts. Cheers. With a minor additional responsibility. Of being on the board of directors. You'll be the youngest board member ever, Maya. Well done. We'll have to keep this to ourselves for now, KK. - Right. - Top secret, baby. You cannot tell anyone. Not even your mother. What do you mean? - No one? - No one at all. But, there's Rahul... Until now he was no one. But now he's on all the cover pages. Until now crime was his nickname. But now he sells like hot cake on television. Destiny's... like a chameleon. Changes colour in an instance. The outcome... can be anything. The outcome... can be anything. - What was he saying? - Nothing. Something about the New York office. Come, let's dance. I'll introduce you to Tarun. Come. - Why did you lie to me? - What? You said you went to New York on business. So, who's this? Your dreams... are just dreams after all. You haven't done anything out of the blue. It isn't your nature, is your lover. You did nothing wrong by going after it. If you faced defeat. Showed me where I stand. This situation... ...will change. The outcome... can be anything. The outcome... can be anything. The grass on the other side... ...is always greener. Free liquor is always best... ...to drown your sorrows in. Slithers and slides like a lizard. The outcome... can be anything. I didn't make it this far by doing nothing, Mrs. Kaamdar. In fact, I've people in the New York office as well. You can't move a muscle in this office... ...without me knowing about it. I just wanted to see whether she tells me or not. The man that shaped her entire career. I'm sure this was already decided... ...between her and John in New York. No one gets promoted suddenly. What you're saying clearly indicates... ...that you were very angry with her. Right? Don't put words in my mouth, Mrs. Kaamdar. This isn't a question worth answering. In fact, you're insulting me by asking me this question. You can ask anyone in this agency. - Praful. - Yes. Did you ever feel that after Maya was promoted... ...to the board of director, there was tension... ...between Rahul and Maya? Mr. Gupta, why get me involved in this? I didn't. What am I supposed to say? Say it. - I'm supposed to take sides now. - No, no. Say what you want to say. Praful, I need to know if you're aware... ...whether Rahul was unhappy of Maya's progress. What are you saying, madam? Rahul's not like that. I mean Aul can tell you. Rahul is a tremendous leader. He has always encouraged new talent. He's always been happy to see his junior's progress. Mr. Gupta, he was slightly surprised. What was he surprised about? There was a big announcement to be made. They were going to make her the national creative head... ...and you didn't tell your CEO. He deserved being told, right. Maya was Rahul's prodigy. National Creative Director. And on the board of directors. I'm so glad KK finally told you. - Can I say something? - What? Say no. Why? You aren't ready for it. You're not ready yet, Maya. - Can I say something, Rahul? - Of course. I'm accepting this offer because I deserve it. If you have a problem, take it up with them. As far as I am concerned, I was given an offer. And I accepted it. End of discussion. All that's left to do is make that announcement. - Yeah. Seven years ago, when I hired Maya... ...did anyone imagine she'll be the National Creative Head? No one imagined that... ...she'll handle two top accounts of this agency. He's the one who got clients like Proton and Digimax. And he was handling them for years. And it was taken from him and given to someone else. Rahul did all the spadework to get them here... ...and now suddenly 'poof', everything is gone. Not just that. No one could imagine that... ...she'd be on KK Doyle's board of directors. You all are great, sir. You all are great. And ma'am, for your kind information. I'll say this today but I'll get jacked for this tomorrow. But after the promotion Maya's behaviour had changed. Excuse me. What do you mean? What do I mean? Her body language. Her language. There was a strange sense of... arrogance in her. A strange arrogance. Come on, Praful. - There was a strange arrogance. - Come on. Don't... - Let him speak. - Do you people agree with that? - Let him speak. - What let him speak? He's being unreasonable. Everyone has the right to speak. He is speaking but he's being unreasonable. Alright. Alright, go ahead. Finish what you are saying. Bowling, bowling, come on. Howzat! These are the same old ideas? Do you think this is a bloody joke? You've a month's notice. Look for another job instead of coming to the office. Rani. Can you please ask HR to prepare termination letter... ...for Tanvi and Prasad. Both of you, thank you. Ma'am, how can you sack people recklessly? Everyone began from somewhere. Even she did. Rahul brought her here. She started somewhere. Why has she forgotten her roots? And then, ma'am, no one had ever imagined... ...what happened one day. - Maya. Maya. I need to talk to you. - Yes, what? I heard that you fired Tanvi and Prasad. - So? - What? Can I know why? They don't know a thing. How many chances do you want me to give them? So now you're judging those I hired? They're bloody good. You may have hired them, but I've to tolerate them. You cannot fire people like this, Maya. It's against the policy of our agency. It's my responsibility to maintain... ...the quality of my department... ...and I hope that... is also the agency's policy. Fine, I'll transfer them to Bangalore. - Yeah, sure. Anyway, there's always some client's daughter... ...or nephew joining here as the trainee. Your hiring policies, Rahul. I didn't enjoy firing them either. New responsibilities, new designation... ...a lot changed. So... I changed slightly. But let me tell you. If an ambitious woman wants to make a place for herself... ...amongst these alpha males, then one needs to be... ...the alpha woman. What the hell? What just happened outside? You two are fighting in the open now? Do you know the effect of this on others... ...when the CEO... and the NCD of the company... ...is fighting like this. What is it, Maya? You're still in love or something. It sure seems that way. Friends, I hope you're having a great time. And I see that Rahul has entered. A warm welcome for him, please. Rahul. Give me your flat keys. Mend your ways, Gupta. - When did you arrive? - Praful. I thought you weren't feeling well. What can be done? One needs to stay visible. Good to see you here. Maya and that Vaswani from the toothpaste company... ...are up to something. Just check. Atention everybody. My partner John could not be here today... ...he sends his regrets. But he has sent us a recorded message. Please. Sorry I couldn't be with you. Damn weather. Have good fun. Have a party. And a very special hello to our darling Maya. We're missing you here in New York. Have a good party. We've been running that cock-a-doodle-doo campaign... ...for a long time. Let's change to something interesting now. - Mr. Vaswani. - Rahul. She has some fantastic ideas. Fantastic ideas. What as it? 'Words aren't enough to fight dental problems.' That's why there is pearly white. Now that she's back from New York... ...I think... I think she should take over the campaign. No, no, no, it's... It was just an idea that popped up. I mean, I still have to run the briefs through Rahul. What? I pay the bills, so... I will give the briefs, what does he got to do with it? - I mean, I am not saying but... - Mr. Vaswani... ...maybe it didn't occur to you. But perhaps our agency... ...doesn't have the time for your campaign. I am not saying, you're saying. You're not saying, I am saying. You know what I am saying. The caravan of life, the countless desires. Filled with pride, always trying to exceed yourself. The caravan of life, the countless desires. Hi. Rahul. Everything's going on under your nose. Do something. Hello. Hi. John. You should have come. Just stop being naughty. Thank you very much for coming here. Rahul, no evening would be complete... ...without a few words word from you. - Yeah. - Come on, Rahul. Yes, KK. I do want to say something. It's all yours. I... I... Rahul. Rahul are you ok. Go away. Keep her away from me. She trashed the entire campaign... ...and now she's putting up an act here? That day, any chances of things going right between them were ruined.' 'Rahul was... too full of hatred.' 'And when he collapsed... ...due to the meningitis attack, maybe Maya... ...was in fact genuinely concerned.' 'She wanted to say something to him.' 'But there were too many walls between them.' 'Some they made themselves, and some by others.' And when Rahul returned from the hospital... ...it seemed like something was possible. Maya even tried to say something. I think that was the last time she tried. Chosen by words, woven by words. Everything we said, everything we heard. I didn't have a clue, neither did you. Wonder where the words made a mistake. The words try to say something unsaid. Silence is trying to speak out. Words decieved the words itself. Mr. Verma, the file had to be delivered at 11. And you're still working on it? Mr. Sharma, these accounts are intricate... If there's any mistake... ...you'll have to pay millions. Fine. But why must you always do everything alone? You've assistants, don't you? Why don't you ask them to do it? Why must you get involved in everything? Everything's on hold because of you. Papa, your lunch. Fine, Mr. Sharma, I'll take your leave. Thank you. And take your wife out for dinner with my salary. Come, son. Why are you getting angry just like that? Such things happen between the boss and his employees. Mr. Sharma, if I stay back today... ...after this my son will never listen to me. See you. Come, son. We'll go home and eat. Okay, Jamshed. I'll introduce you to Rahul. He'll sit with you, he'll talk about the project. - Sure. You take a look at the ideas... Mrs. Kaamdar, how lovely to see you. What are you doing here? - Exactly what I did... - Mr. Jamshed. - I've something urgent to deal with... - Sure. I'll catch you, okay. Gupta, please look after him. I'll be right back. Two minutes. Sorry, you were saying. There's a similar case here... ...like the one between you and your secretary. You remember that whole thing about sexual... Sorry. I've got to rush. I've got a meeting. I'll catch you later. Take care. Okay. What's going on? Gupta, cut the bullshit. It means what I heard about Maya and Rahul is true? Mr. Jamshed's asking something? - About Rahul and Maya... - What's happening, KK? Relax, Jamshed. I'll handle everything. This isn't as serious as your case was, okay. - Relax. - Listen. Listen, stop giving me the bullshit. Make it go away fast. Otherwise I'll have to shift my account to a stable agency. Don't worry, you carry on. - I'll be seeing you. Okay. - Hi. - Maya sweetheart. - Yeah, KK. This has gotten out of hand. It's enough. If it wasn't for me... ...even John couldn't have appointed you on the board. So, is it necessary to sleep with the CO... ...to be on the board? Just asking. You had a argument with the Corporator again, didn't you? Again, I'm sure, about toilet facilities? Very good, mother. What? Even his wife took part in the rally? Fine, mother, I've got to go now. I'm sorry. After you returned from New York... ...there was some tension between you and Rahul? A lot of differences? What happened after that? It was the management's decision... ...that I'll handle the Digimax and Proton accounts. Independently. And Rahul handled them before me. So, it was natural that... ...I would ask him for a handover of the accounts. And I did. And then came Rahul Verma's excuses. - What is it? - He's signing something. - Wait. - It's 8:30. I mean, either he's going for dinner, or a meeting... ...or an important client's visiting. Or he has a pedicure appointment. And then his dog falls sick. I mean... I was just going nuts about this. Please check. So something or the other always. And whenever I asked him... Nice haircut, looking good, I'll see you in half an hour. And then Rahul Verma disappears. For the entire day. And then, my final presentation... ...with the CEO of Digimax. I couldn't stand it anymore. So I went to his cabin. Just a second. Please. Thanks. - What's all this? - It's nine o'clock. The office has closed down. Hungry? Sandwiches. Thirsty? Beer. Headache? Aspirins. Now I need the handover of Digimax. - Now. - Just one thing. You forgot to pack the condoms. Just kidding. Maya, you know the files contain a lot of research. Explaining all that today, it's impossible. Rahul, I've got an important meeting tomorrow... ...with the CEO. I need this. Well, I'm leaving for home now. Some friends are coming over for drinks. I've a suggestion. Come home. We can sit and talk there comfortably. I would have, it's just that... ...Tarun's here and I've to go for dinner with him. Well its important to have a good sex life too. But you decide what's more important. Thanks for the goodies. Three... two... one. Yeah! Come on, come on. Sorry, buddy. Bye. - See you. - See you. There you are. I was looking all over for you. I thought you left. Why would I leave, Rahul? - I came here on business. - Yeah, your Digimax files. That's what I am looking for. There you are, good luck. Thank you. My bag. It felt like my cushion. This has all the files, right? - And... the campaign? - What campaign? - The Digimax campaign. - That's not complete. Rahul, please get serious. - Tomorrow's the presentation. - So what? Tell them that you're working on a new campaign. That you didn't like the older one. They'll be impressed, you know... Rahul, please. If I don't give the presentation tomorrow... ...we will lose this account. You will lose this account. I told you, Maya. You aren't ready for this role. What the hell, Rahul. My career will be over. Do you understand? You can't do this! Your career? The one that I made? Okay, let's try to save that career. Digimax Campaign. Search. Sorry, babes. No campaign. Rahul, what do you want? Chanel no.5. Same perfume. What are you doing? Just revisiting some old places. I am going to sleep. On my bed. If you've anything more to say, you know where I am. Just joking. Say hi to Tarun. You know the way out. Condoms. Chanel no.5. Revisiting old places. If you've anything more to say, I'll be in my bedroom. The next day... I lost the Digimax account. Casual flirting. What was wrong in it? That Chanel thing? Yes, I did recognise it. Introduced her to it. She couldn't even pronounce it. Channel, Channel is what she would call it. But then I want to know... ...why did she come home wearing that perfume? To bring back some old memories, you think? My point is, Mrs. Kaamdar... ...there's a different point of view to everything. That night she came home. Welcome home. - You didn't bring Tarun along. - No. Tarun. Joking. I've some clients at home. I'll get rid of them soon, okay. You know the drill. Come, join us for a photo. Wait, wait. Three, two, one... Yeah... Sorry, buddy. - Bye. - See you. See you. Sorry about that. You know these clients, they never want to leave. I know. Make yourself comfortable, I'll get my stuff. She asked for the Digimax files... ...I handed them over, and then she just freaked out. What do you want, Rahul? Chanel. No.5. Same perfume. Nice. - What are you doing? - Just revisiting some old places. Here are your Digimax files. - Okay. - Good luck. My bag, Rahul. - It has all the files? - Yes. And the campaign? Campaign? What campaign? That has all the files, Maya. If you think I'll write the campaign for you... ...then that's not my job. That is your freaking job, Rahul Verma. What? That's not. You don't call this a handover. This is totally unprofessional. I'll take this to the board. Are you threatening me? I am warning you. You'll regret it. - You watch. - Don't threaten me like that. You will pay for this, okay. Don't talk to me like that. You watch. Fine, we believe you. But you invited a female colleague home... ...that late at night for official work. Why? First of all, I had a party in my house, I had friends over. And yes, she asked for help and so I invited her over. And why am I trying to justify this? We often work late and... ...continue our meetings at my house informally. Right, Kavita. Nimmi. That's true actually. Try to help someone and this is what you get to hear. He was helping me!? This is harassment, Mrs. Kaamdar. I cannot allow this. He's harrassing me. I will not allow that. If you were going through all this... You were being harassed... ...then why didn't you file this complaint then? You are right. I should've complained right then. I should've complained. But that's the problem with us women... We always think whether we're overreacting. Are we making a mountain out of a molehill? Not that I didn't do anything. I went to KK. John was saying he's reconsidering his decision... ...to increase his share in our agency. How the hell did this happen? What can I do? I am trying. I am trying. But I don't know what's wrong with Rahul... Maya. I am tired of hearing excuse after excuse. Maya, please. Just make it work between Rahul and you. Okay. Yes, John. I understand, John. Okay, John. Rascal. Scoundrel. One one hand he was getting rebuked on the phone... ...and on the other, I was getting ideas for the ad. We just lost the freaking Digimax account. It's all your freaking fault. Get that. Fool. Stupid. Idiot. Bumbling bum. Good for nothing. Your career is over. Finished. The end. Heard that. Hello, boss. - You ass, you idiot, you're a piece of bird shit. You moron. Screw you, man. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Why are you smiling? Make it work with Rahul. Remember, Mr. Gupta? You were there too. And that's just half of it, shall I say the entire thing? Just hold on, Maya. Just hold on. Why are you saying all this here? This is a confidential matter, about John's Investment, the company. - You cannot talk about it here. - Then don't ask me. - Don't ask me. - There are other people in this room. Ask Mrs. Kaamdar not to ask me all this. Don't ask me, and don't compell me... ...to say why I didn't complain. - It's about you... Make it work, right? Cool down, Maya. Just cool down. He has a point. But... ...let's just continue with... ...right now whatever is... All I want to say is that, I tried... ...and I had no idea that this was just the beginning. Send all these creatives to Praful... ...for the one-line tags. Just have a look. What do you think? Sure. - Yeah. - I will. And this... ...should be the main final campaign. - Right. The basis of this campaign is... ...what does a person miss the most in his life. I miss my first two-wheeler. - My motorbike. - First kiss, definitely. - First kiss. - First boyfriend. First boyfriend, first kiss... no, no, has to be better than that. Please. Think of something else. I don't know how many of you have experienced this... ...but what I miss is... when someone gives you a nice shampoo. What? A good shampoo. 'Oh, baby. That feels great.' Is that a he or a she? She, of course. Anything else other than shampoo? Don't go that way. But shampoo. Bubbles, bath, nice... Rahul... Is it your birthday? - F-F No. - Oh, beautiful lady of my dreams... You are my flower spreading your essence make my life sweeter. Oh lady, who comes in my dreams every night - Beautiful. ...and spread your sweet perfume everywhere... Stunning. Sexy! Chameli soap come love me. - Great. Good work. - Thank you, sir. - Go ahead. - Thank you sir. - Oh hello. Like some lunch. - Hello. You call that great work? Wasn't bad? You think housewives behave like that. What do you think, Maya? Normal wives have a problem with sex? They all have sex. And anyway, it's the work of the team you hired. Good team. Okay, okay, okay. Rahul. Like they say, the wise can take a hint. But I am a genius. - How long? - How long? - One minute. - One minute. Ok. Why were you staring at me? I wasn't staring, I was fantasizing. That's the least I can do. I can, can't I? Why are you doing this, Rahul? Come on, Maya. Where's your sense of humour? - Sense of humour? - Yeah. Don't harass me, Rahul. Harass? - That's a strong word, Maya. - It is. So now a few people want to finish off the sense of humour in this agency. So now we can't say Hello, sunshine...? ...good morning, beautiful yo, sexy legs. Beautiful hair, L'Oreal; Can I be your dress? Your husband's so lucky; Your wife's so lucky. Simple, casual jokes. The presentation I was working on... ...is given to someone else because... ...I was visiting my mother for two days. What a sense of humour. Good one. That's so funny. Careful, Mr. Gupta. You've a knack... of buying roses and chocolates... ...for your secretary. - Rahul... Calling them babes, babes. I can see you here. In my place. In a sexual harassment case. You can humiliate me in any way you want... ...but I will find it so funny. It's so funny. You can keep ogling at me... ...and I will say That is cute... ...that is so cute. My fiance flies down for a day from New York... ...and I go to the airport to pick him up, but... ...this agency has a sense of humour. Yes, Tarun, I will pick you up, from the airport. Yes. 7 o'clock? Terminal one! Okay. Is your mummy coming? Hey, Maya. The Zest meeting is fixed for 7 o'clock. Rahul just sent a mail. - No, no, I already discussed this with him. Yes, Tarun. It's nothing. Just hold on. - Hey, Rahul? - Yeah. I informed you earlier that... ...I won't be able to make it at And you said you'll reschedule for 8. You can't come at 7? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Hi, Tarun. Landed. Great. I'll be at the airport in five minutes. I'll see you. Yes, Rani. What? The Zest meeting? But... Turn the car around. Yeah, Tarun. I... Yeah, I was on my way, but... ...I will have to go back to the office... ...because my meeting's been rescheduled. Oh, come on, Maya. I'm supposed to go back tomorrow. I know, the CEO's here, it's an important meeting. It's my presentation, so I've to be there. Forget it now. And at the end of the ad, the boy and girl come closer... ...they kiss and they begin to dance. This is obviously where the music begins. And they start twirling around. Morning turns to night and night to morning... ...and they're still twirling. And as soon as the first ray of light falls on the ocean... ...the by-line of your product appears. - Yeah. Zest condoms, this night will never end. 'This night will never end.' I like it. It works. Yeah. Brilliant. Hey, Maya. What happened? Your boyfriend's flight landed on time? You're back early. - Yeah. - Great. - Hi. - Hey. - Wish you were here. - Yeah. - We've cracked it. - No worry. - Praful will brief you. Praful. - Yes. - Of course, of course. - Yeah. - So, shall we talk in the office? - Of course. The brief. Hey, where have you been? That bastard! Bastard. - Yes. - Come, Rahul. - What's he doing here? - Trying to harass you, what else. Look, the matter's getting very complicated... ...so, we decided to call you two together... ...and we want you to talk this out face to face. - Do you have an objection? - I've no objection. It's better. We can talk face to face. - Yeah. Let's finish this. Maya, please continue. We went to Gurgaon. We had a presentation. Rahul. We've got to make this car no.1. Tell me how will you do it? Mr. Mehra, you've a great product... ...and we've a great game plan. It's small, but it's a storm. Rahul, I am sorry. Let's just get the basics right here. The fact is your car's completely rubbish. There are much better cars in this segment... ...which are cheaper and have better features. So, I really don't think it's worth it. I think this car can run on only one thing. And that's celebrity endorsement. According to me we should hire a glamorous celebrity... ...or a film-star as a brand ambassador. He'll charge a few crores. I hope you're okay with that, Mr. Mehra? And then you can show him... ...driving this car amidst beautiful valleys... ...with beautiful girls. Hide its average features... ...and this car will surely sell. Let's sell it on style and glamour. Instead of price and features. Right. It's true, that our car has no special feature. You're being quite honest, quite unlike other agencies. Rahul, I must praise your find. You really recognised her and put her in the correct place. Ladies and Gentlemen, the deal is on. And, Rahul. 'Always hire people better than you'. Well done. Just a minute. Just a minute! Yes, I was angry. But she didn't mention why I was angry. Did you forget... how this all started? That day I met Maya at the airport. Yes, mother. She was speaking on the phone. As soon as I arrived she asked... What are you doing here? Going to Delhi. This campaign is very important for our agency. I will have to come along. Hey mister. Show me the campaign. You call this a campaign? What's the first thing Mehra's going to ask me? He'll say. 'We've to make this car no.1.' 'Tell me how will you do it? ' I will say there isn't a single feature in this car... ...which will appeal to our consumer. This car can run on only one thing. And that isn't petrol, sir. It's Celebrity endorsement. Hire a big Bollywood star... ...make him drive around in this car with beautiful girls... ...amidst beautiful valleys. Hide the rubbish features of this car. And then maybe this car will sell. But that won't happen. Because Mehra's a scrooge. He won't shell out 5-6 crores. So we'll have to go with what we have. Praful, we've to make this better. Wait, I don't get this. Why didn't you tell us all this earlier? What difference does it make, Mrs. Kaamdar? Fine, he talked about the celebrity pitch at the airport. But the important thing is... ...who had the guts to speak up before the client? Who took the risk? - But that's also irrelevant, I mean... - Irrelevant? That's the only relevant thing, Maya. That you can do anything for power. That's exactly why we're sitting here. - No. We're sitting here for what you did with me in the hotel room! What did I do with you in the room, Maya? I would like to know as well. Music. Cheers. Hey where you gone? Thank you so much for coming. Guys, party over. You Go. Bye, bye. Thank you. - Bye. - No! - Okay, for the road. - Not fair. For the road. We can finish it later. Happy birthday... thank you so much. Goodnight, Rahul. What was all this, Maya? My birthday party. I'm not talking about the party. What happened at the conference room? The Bollywood celebrity bit was my idea. And you presented that without asking me? My idea, your idea. - What difference does it make? - You're crossing the line, Maya. You forget that I am the CEO of this company. And you forget that I am the National Creative Director. All I am saying is that there's a way of doing things. Yes, your way of doing things? Of Sucking up, right? Dancing to your tunes, right? Like I used to... So that's what this was all about. Sorry. What are you looking at? A new Maya. Good or bad. Sometimes in this job it's good to be bad. I learnt that from you. Did I also teach you... ...to change the rules of a relationship suddenly? What relationship? Oh, the one where you're fucking my head? What do you want to say? That everything will be fine if I sleep with you? That's one way to put it. Did you say that? Yes, I did. Because I was bloody furious. I was angry. But do you want to know what I actually wanted to do? But did I do that? No. No. You didn't do anything like that. But do you know what I was feeling at the moment? But that didn't happen. Yes. Something like that. That everything will be fine if I sleep with you? That's one way to put it. Just come here. Rahul, goodnight and get out. Bitch. You've grown too big, have you? I taught you everything. And this is what I get? - Stop it. - I'll finish you. Are you insane? Nothing like that happened? - Didn't you try to use force on me? - Not at all. You didn't do anything I just said? National Creative Director at her creative best. The truth is that night she was furious, drunk... ...and she tried to assault me. Everything will be fine if I sleep with you? That's one way to put it. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Stop it. What is wrong with you, woman? Are you crazy? Can anyone believe that I tried to assault you? Please, Maya. Thankfully Praful was in the room... ...otherwise I wonder what else she would've accused me of. - Will you stop lying? - Please, Maya, stop it. I've had enough. He says he can't take this anymore. I had a life too. A personal life. And now... What should I do? Quit. Resign from this job. What did you say? Exactly what you heard. Quit the job. Do you know how hard I've worked to get here? I changed myself, Tarun. I deserve this. I mean... how many get the chance... ...to be at the peak of their talent. National Creative Director. And I should quit... ...because one man has a problem with my progress. Just... just some bloody . I am so sorry. What the hell are you doing? I am really sorry. Leave it, leave it. Please, just leave it. You know something, I'm out of here. Listen... you can't just leave like this. What's wrong? Why are you so worried? Look, Maya, let me clarify one thing. You will withdraw this case. I've got clients in Mumbai and New York. This will only bring humiliation. You get it? Look, Maya. It will only lead to baseless questions. Why don't you understand? Come on, Maya. You had a scene with him. You think I didn't know? You were sleeping with him. Maya. Good news from Norman Corporation. They're expanding in 20 more markets. KK, you were saying that there are just three... ...women National Creative Directors in India, right? - Yes. - Might be just two. - What? I am filing a case of sexual harassment against your CEO. So, this is our presentation. - But, we've some more ideas, right? - Yes mam. What do you think? Look, you're proving an old cliche. That women are too weak and emotional... ...for senior management positions. I'm sorry. Fine. Sorry to spoil the party, guys. It's all rubbish. It's all bloody nonsense. She must have a reason. All I know is that Rahul won't spare her. If he leaves the agency will shut down. She's just putting up an act. It's not a big deal. I think she should just do him and get it over and done with. Anymore advice? It's not like you haven't done anything with him? Nimmi, I'm coming as well. Damn you all. When a women turns ferocious... (quote) Everything goes wrong, Nimmi. You've asked enough questions in the past two days. Can I ask one question? Did she complain when we were having an affair? No. Did she complain when she was getting promoted? No. But when she was appointed on the board of directors... ...she suddenly felt a need to complain... harassment. Why? It's clear but you're not going to get it. How will you get it? You're a woman. And in every woman's view, all men are bastards. Look, the CEO's position is the only one higher... ...than the National Creative Director. That is my position in the company. If I... I'm proven guilty in this sexual harassment case... ...then I lose my job. That means... the path is clear for her. You can trust anyone you want. I cannot tolerate any more of this humiliation. I am done here. What are you all saying? You believe what Rahul just said. We aren't accusing you. The committee's only suggesting that... ...this can be a possibility. It's my fault to have expected anything from you. I'll see you in court. What's the scene, Gupta? The scene's really bad. The direction she's taking this case is dangerous. And if the media finds out... ...it would be disastrous. And every girl in the agency... ...will be filing cases of sexual harassment. That can't be good boys. Then every man will be... screwed. Shut the hell, Paul. John shouldn't find out. Gupta. I give you a free hand. Do anything required. But this issue shouldn't get out of hand. Put an end to it today at any cost. Are you sure? Do I look like I'm freaking not sure? Get the hell out of here. Go. Take my advice, KK. Go to Bangkok, get a massage. - Go. - I get it, KK. What the hell is your problem, Paul? KK, bloody dumb fool. You've lost. You tried to create a parallel power centre... ...in this agency. But guess what? She is out of control like Saddam Husain. And you're screwed... just like America. Beware, KK. She's an unguided missile. About to blow. And hey, no pun intended. But she's not going to take this lying down. Hello. Advocate Rajni Mathur's residence. Sorry, sorry, I am late. Mr. Gupta sent me this gift. But we'll talk about that later. Let's continue. We were thinking that... ...we'll never reach a decision this way. Let's vote. - Right, Mr. Gupta. - Not a bad idea. Thank you. Nimmi? Look, I feel Maya's allegations... ...are wrong. Rahul can never do such a thing. You know. What? Kavita, I genuinely believe Rahul is innocent, okay. Kavita? Maya's telling the truth. Aul? - Even I feel Maya's telling the truth, I don't think so. Rahul is innocent. I... I don't know. In the beginning I thought Maya's the victim. But after listening to them, after listening both the versions... ...it's difficult to decide. Because they both sound right from their viewpoints. They sound so genuinely honest. I can't understand who is lying and who is not. Honestly, I am confused. I cannot decide. Whom should I vote for I... I don't know. You want us to hire a private detective...? ...get a police conform, defame the agency? Mr. Gupta, I told you what I feel. I think this issue should be properly investigated. That's what I feel. It's really hard to decide. Fine, then. The votes are a tie. KK, I think management should take a decision now. Right. Like I'd told you. It's easier to prove rape. But sexual harassment... very difficult. Then what are my options? What are my options? What is the bloody solution? Khurana, you draw advocate's salary every month. Now earn them. What do you mean by that? We've two options. Offer her a compensation package. You can file a court case if you like. Or they'll offer you an compensation... ...to withdraw the case, so take that. And look for another job. KK, I can tell you... ...she will not accept the compensation package at all. If she rejects it, then file a case of kickback against her. Say that some production house offered her a few cars... ...sponsored a foreign trip, in exchange of an ad. You'll have to do that. Before she approaches the media and the court. Then you know what's to be done. Khurana, file a case of kickback against her. And after this she won't get a job anywhere. I'll make sure of that. Maya, in such a situation... ...they will try to destroy your career completely. Take my advice if you have any other option, then try that... ...and beat them at their own game. 'If you have any other option, then try that... ...and beat them at their own game.' The caravan of life, the countless desires. Filled with pride, trying to exceed yourself. You're the boat and the storm. You're the question and the answer. Why do you burn like the lamp in the storm? The caravan of life, the countless desires. Why doesn't somebody fix this damn light? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why, Rahul? Why? Why? How does it feel to be defeated, Maya? Do you have any idea... ...what these people, you were affiliated with... ...are going to do with you tomorrow? I feel pity seeing you in this condition. I feel sorry for you, Maya. You could've been much more... ...but look at where you are now. Again and again and again and again. You forgot to pack condoms. 'Sexy:' 'Good Shampoo.' 'Boyfriend's flight landed on time.' 'Don't harass me, Rahul.' How many times do you want to 'win'? 'What campaign? ' 'You cannot fire people like this, Maya.' 'I'll finish you.' Do you have any idea... that I can just squash you? - Really? - You, KK. - I can squash you all. - Okay. Today I met someone who will have you all begging on your knees. All of you. You know, Rahul. Whenever I made a mistake in school... ...the teacher would say, write a thousand times... ...on the board that you won't do mischief again. And I would. And after writing it a thousand times! Do you know what would happen, Rahul? ...I would stop doing that mischief. It bloody works. It works. Every time... I made love to you. I asked myself am I doing something wrong. Am I taking an undue advantage? Am I really a slut? Because that's what the people were calling me. I am a bitch, I am a slut. But I didn't believe them. Not until the most important person... Not until you didn't say that I was one. 'You all know who benefitted from this relation.' When you said that Rahul, then I believed it. I became one. I... I became a slut. I became a slut, Rahul. And then everything seemed easy. You should be happy. You should be really happy today. Because I went to John. I went to John. I went to that bloody sleaze John. To his room. 'Oh, Maya.' I went to John. You said. You said that I used him to get this job? I never did. Not once. But today... ...I did it to save that job. I went to John. I went to his room. 'Drink, my dear.' Let's sit down. So me. You can do me Rahul because I'm a slut. You can do me because I'm a slut. Just stop it. Just stop it, Maya. Stop it. What did you do with John? Doesn't make a difference. Doesn't make a difference to you. Maya, tell me what you did with John. This is how you wanted to see me, right. How does it matter? Why do you care? You're lying. You didn't do anything with John. Why do you care? Why do you care? I do care because I love you. I loved you and... - Then why all of this? - Because I was angry! You know when you returned from New York... ...I was happy. I was actually happy. 'What did he say? ' 'Nothing, something about the New York office.' Why did you lie to me, Maya? Why did you let them... come between us, Maya. I didn't lie. And you let them use you like this. Against me. I tried to explain it to you... ...what the hell was KK doing between us. 'Take my advice... say no.' 'You aren't ready for it.' No. If you cared... If it really made a difference to you... ...you wouldn't have let me go to Delhi. Come on, Maya... - You wouldn't have let me go to Delhi. 'You will call KK and tell him to transfer me to Delhi.' I tried to stop you... in my own way. 'I didn't put in all this effort in you... ...so that you could just leave like this.' I was always like the way I was. What did you expect me to do? Change in a day? 'Come on, Maya. Don't go to Delhi. Why? ' And what did you say? 'Because there's no future.' What did you want? You wanted me to beg you to stay? That night in the hotel... ...when I extended my hand, I wanted to start afresh. 'Rahul, goodnight and get out.' And you thought I was sexually harassing you? Hate, Maya. Your hate had made you blind. But that didn't give you the right to do that. Bitch, I will finish you. Hate. No, Rahul. I loved you. I loved you. I loved you. Bullshit. I came back for you. You're lying. I loved you. I loved you. - I loved you. - Just stop lying, Maya. I loved you. You came back with Tarun to take away my job! I... I was all alone in New York. I met him there. But... I didn't love him. He followed me here but... ...but now, there is nothing left between us. 'Come on, Maya, you had a scene with him.' 'You were sleeping with him.' Everything is over. I came back for you. As a successful woman. I thought you would be happy. You would be happy that I'm successful. And maybe... ...maybe you could love me. I came back for you. Please, Maya. Tell me what happened with John? You men are so strange. You only realise that you love someone... ...when she sleeps with someone else. Come on, Maya. Stop this, please. What happened with John? Rahul. People like you and me... ...who want much more than just love in their lives... ...you think there is anything possible, between us. I am sorry, Maya. I... really am sorry. Please say that you didn't do anything with John. Please. Ask yourself this question, Rahul. Look, we've to take a decision. Let's stop discussing this. Yeah! Kill the bitch! You're right. Kill the bitch! Bury her. Paul, enough. Isn't that what you all want? I mean, come on. Rahul's your star performer. Listen, enough. He handles most of the clients. If you lose him you'll be in dire straits. So fine. Kill the bitch, KK! Hello, Rosy, I said don't disturb me. What? Rahul's sent a mail. Hi Jokers and friends. The past few weeks until today... ...we've been going through quite some stress. 'I am leaving.' 'Consider this email as my resignation letter.' 'I don't know where I am going... ...but let me tell you why I am going.' 'My father always said, if anyone ever proves you wrong... ...then always support them.' 'And now that I've been proven wrong.' 'It's important to find out how the hell did it happen? ' 'I mean I was so perfect.' 'So how did this happen? ' 'So I am going to figure that out.' 'And don't worry, KK, I won't break your agency.' 'I won't steal your clients.' 'I wouldn't have left if that was my motive.' 'I would've had you sacked... ...and taken over the agency.' 'I hope I have left this company with my dignity intact.' 'So long guys.' 'Thanks KK, Paul, Kavita... ' 'Mr. Gupta, be careful.' 'And for a special someone... ' '... that question you had not answered... ...I think I know the answer to that question.' 'I am sorry, John.' 'I cannot do this.' Why do eyes convey the sorrows? Why try to revive what's over? Why tell you about my grievances. Why shall I decorate my dreams with your memories? What's this growing... between us? What's this fluttering... between us? Why is the dawn emerging... between us? Why is the evening setting... between us? Why do eyes convey the sorrows? Why try to revive what's over? All's well that ends well, huh! Let's call Maya. Maya. Maya. - Deep down it was all about you. - Oh! God. So why did it deviate? I said it coolly... but filled you with rage. So why did it change? 'People like you and me... ' '... who want something more in life other than love... ' '... is there anything possible between us.' What's this growing... between us? Why is the dawn emerging... between us? Why is the evening setting... between us? Silence is trying to speak out. There's denial in the words. Silence is trying to speak out. There's denial in the words. Chosen by words, woven by words. Everything we said, everything we heard. I didn't have a clue, neither did you. Wonder where the words made a mistake. The words try to say something unsaid. The words try to narrate something unheard. They wounded the heart. Words decieved the words itself. Silence is trying to speak out. There's denial in the words. Silence is trying to speak out. There's denial in the words. Silence is trying to speak out. There's denial in the words. Silence is trying to speak out. There's denial in the words.
