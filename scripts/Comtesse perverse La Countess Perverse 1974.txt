The house on the island... Help me... They're going to kill me. To... to kill me! But I... I escaped. A man with black glasses... Looking for me... My twin sister had disappeared ...on the island I had to find her. My sister was scared. ...of the island... Those rocks... Those rocks...! They warned of death! But I had to go on. He wouldn't go any closer I had to swim there Swim to that house Swim all the way to that evil house. I was exhausted I was exhausted The place... was silent Deserted Like a cemetery I was scared I felt I was being watched Watched from up there I was scared to death But I had to go on A couple... A strange couple Count and Countess Zaroff... They live on the island They invited me to... stay with them I became their guest It's delicious, well done Rador - I hope our guest agrees. - It's exquisite. Very unusual. Different and unique. Not for us. We're used to it now. My dear wife introduced me to this type of meat. Sometimes us women have to push their men to try new things. This all seems very mysterious. It's a strange feeling. What sort of meat is this? Rador... You'll soon find out all about this meat. Ivanna will enjoy telling you. Isn't that so? It's wild game. I hunt it myself. And Rador cooks it. Let's have coffee in the lounge. Rador has a special blend. He's a fascinating man. I can see why you're so in love. We share many tastes. We enjoy hunting, fine dining and succulent meals. It's good to share one's pleasures. What are these heads? Aren't they amazing? Do you like them? I'm proud of them and my husband loves them. They are great mementos. A wild boar from Hungary. A bear from Crimea. The deer is from Austria... The puma from Llanos. The head from Amazonia. The head from Amazonia. What is it? What do you want? We want you. Take her! Take her! No... Let me go. Let me go... Take her! Harder! Yes! Yes! Like that... I'm coming! Yes... Yes! ...Yes! Get me the syringe. Quiet now. Calm down. They wanted... to kill me! OK... So what now? Take her back to the island? That's fine, I'll wait. No problem. I want to speak to Sylvia Aguado. Orders from the Countess. She wants another victim. Hi, Sylvia. Were you asleep? It's ten already. Why not come here for lunch? No, it's not like that. We'll expect you then? Yes, we should talk. OK? Right, in one hour then. Don't be scared, Bob I know you're taking a risk, but... ...we have no choice if we want to escape from here. Go far away and forget all about this. To escape we need money and to get that we need them. I just hope it works. - So, Sylvia, having fun? - Yes, it's wonderful here You're lucky to live in such a place. Nothing to do but lie in the sun... ...breathe the clean air, lulled by the waves. You're right. But you're staying near the sea, aren't you? Yes, but in a cheap hotel And only for ten days holiday. In a horrible room with no view of the sea. Listen, Sylvia, I've got an idea... Why don't you move in here? An excellent idea. We can all three have fun together. Do you like Bob? Yes, he's a nice guy. That's all? I'm not the jealous type. You can tell me. But he's your husband. That's not a problem. I like him to have fun. And sometimes I might even join in. What do you mean? Sylvia? Yes, Bob! Move in here. I want you... I think I love you. Forget that nonsense about your hotel. Come and live here. I can't... You're crazy. Yes, he's crazy. That's why I love him. And you will too. Now, stop worrying. - Let's go get your things. - Alright, but I'll do it. I'll be back in half an hour. See? That was easy. I knew it would be. I feel like laughing. She's so dumb. I want you. I need you. The touch of you drives me crazy. Your skin... so sensual. Your lips, so enticing. Come, don't leave me alone. Sylvia... Come here. That's enough, it's my turn now. Dirty bitch! I wish we could stay here. Come on, get dressed. They're waiting for us. Come on, let's go. This house scares me. Don't be silly. - She's beautiful, isn't she Rador? - Yes, quite charming. A real jewel... ...for a collector like me. Yes, Sylvia, it's a pleasure for us to know someone so lovely. Right, Rador? A huge pleasure. You are sweet and tender. How old are you, my child? Who cares? She's here... ...she's a looker. What more do you need? Forgive me, Mr Nubar, I didn't mean to offend you. You don't! Are you two finished? Listen here... You don't talk to the Count like that. He just wanted to know more about our guest. - You know we love such details - You bet I know. Please, Bob, don't be so rude. Bob is a man with strong passions. Had his education been as strong, he'd be perfect. Shut it! I don't bear grudges. And to prove it... Here's the best piece of meat. Keep it, I don't want it. Control yourself. I'm sorry, he's not been himself these last days. So I see. Maybe you should leave. Your illness might prove dangerous. I'll be fine now. Poor Bob, he struggles with the pleasures of the flesh. That's it, I'm off. I want no part of your vile orgies. Shame, he's usually such a sweet boy. Yes, he's very sweet. Do you like our favorite meat, Sylvia? Don't ask the sweet girl to lie. This meat is rather tough. Not up to our usual standard. But next time... Oh, sorry - you won't be here. Why? It's likely - Am I upsetting you? - On the contrary Just that you will have already left by the time we start cooking. Oh yes, that's a fact. Already left, indeed. It's so lovely here. Yes, it is... Spectacular. But I prefer... the beauty of the human body. I didn't hear you come in. I thought you might need something to wear in bed. Thanks. But... where's Moira? Is she asleep already? Yes. She was very tired. She's quite delicate. Is that a problem? Yes, because I really like her. - You'd like to play with her? - We already have. I'll do my best to help you forget Moira. I'll be back once Rador is asleep. Sylvia, what are you doing? Leave her be, my dear. She's curious like all kids. You know, it's no easy task to cut off a human head. It's hard work. Come, my dear. Come and help us. A fine trophy... for my little collection. But it's monstrous... How could you? We'll keep the rest of her body. She's magnificent. Her flesh will be so tender. Moist... Her breasts are superb. They're my favorite parts. You eat human flesh?! Of course! And so do you. That meat you enjoyed so much, it was human flesh. You're completely insane. It's horrible. Come, my child, don't upset yourself. Reject nothing that gives pleasure. Don't be so conventional. Admit you enjoyed the meal. She's dim, but she's certainly juicy. I think we're going to have fun, my dear. Yet another fine feast day. It'll soon be dawn. Why prolong my torture? I know what you want. You want to kill me. Put my head next to those... ...those other poor innocents. That would be too easy. And far too cheap for us. We're artists. You have no conception of the nobility of certain emotions. I, Countess Zaroff, am incapable of killing in cold blood. I love the hunt... The game of life and death. I always give my prey a chance to escape. At dawn we shall let you loose. Exactly ten minutes later, my sweet, I will hunt you down with my bow. If we have not caught you when the church clock strikes 9... You will be free. And I myself will take you back to dry land. These are the rules of the game. Or else... Or else you become a tender and succulent roast for our table. The birds are already singing. It is dawn... Let it begin. Murderers! Did it go well? Very well. We'll get 2 million for her. Countess! Countess! Why? I'll call the police. You hear me? I'll do it... I don't think you'll do that. You're involved in this too. I've waited for this moment so long, my love. For me, you will be the best meal of my life.
