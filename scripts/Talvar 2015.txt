Well done Mr. Kumar! We are proud of you. Thank you Sir. Sir you know, I have seen the files. I understand... I'll talk to him. But where is he? There he is! - Sir... - I told you... he'd be hiding somewhere... and playing his game. The Minister wanted to meet you... but you were nowhere to be found. Sir, I'd told Mr. Pillai about my reservation in taking that case. And I told Mr. Secretary that, Didn't I tell you... ordinary murder cases are way below Ashwin's standards. Look Ashwin... It's not an ordinary murder case anymore. The entire middle class society is shaken up. How can a father murder his own daughter? I know... And even if it's true, as the police say, till the CDI does not verify it... The issue will remain stuck like a fishbone in our throat. And he tells me you're the best person - to handle this for faster results. - No that's not true... The files are in your car. Sir may I ask you something? Whose idea was it to make the CDI? Why? What an apt date to celebrate CDI day. 1st April. Give. Enjoy! Khempal! Khempal! Wait a minute! His phone isn't connecting. Wait five minutes... Madam, you have the duplicate key? - Yes. Throw it from the balcony, I'll go down and catch it. Okay- Basanti! Shruti! Shruti! Look at what Khempal has done! Sit... sit... Sir I had called. Where's the body? Here in the bedroom. Goddamn leeches! Sorry. Same girl? Is this her? Yes. How old is she? I mean, was... Fourteen. Name? Shruti. Servant's name? Khem pal. Your name? Amrish. You're a neighbor? She's my niece... Lift the sheet at least first! What are you doing Champaklal?! Come Uncle... Oh these guys are after me! Yes Sir... These vultures arrive before the murder even happens. - Stay back! - Move! - Jai Hind Sir. - Jai Hind. Move the bottle. Sit. Initial inquiries, Sir. This is the girl's mother, that's the father. So... Any problems in school? Any boyfriend? She was 14 years old! I mean... Any best friend? A boy? Or a girl? Why don't you understand officer? It's Khempal! There were four people in the house... two are alive, one dead and one missing. Instead of asking these stupid questions, go and look for that b! Volume! Sir is sitting here. Dhaniram... listen... It is the servant. Send one team to the railway station one to his house, and neighbors'. And one to the mobile company. It's an open and shut case! 5 feet 2 inches. Weight medium. Color wheatish I'm sending you a photo now. Go and give this quickly. Tell me... Sir the Gorakhpur express leaves at 7pm. That means he should still be in the city somewhere. Do you have anyone with you for identification? Yes Sir. Dr. Tandon's compounder. He's also from Khempal's village. Good. Okay- Okay Sir. Khempal is a lustful guy. And quite randy too. He had a thing for Shruti baby. But he's a grandfather... he even has two grandchildren. SQ? He too has a heart that beats... Is this a murder or a suicide? You still don't know? It's murder. The servant killed her and ran away. Carefully... She's a little girl...! Relax... - Sir! A byte please! - - Dr.Tandon! Why did your servant do this? - Sir, the whole room is a blood bath. The sheets are soaked red. Yes Sir... I'm at Sameer Vihar... No Sir, don't say that... I'll... I'll post someone else here and come. Yes Sir... Jai Hind. We've taken the samples right? So... Can we put them on the terrace to dry? You can put your sheets... and your blankets... in your cupboards, or lockers or even where the sun don't shine. What do I care? Right sir. Am I cracking jokes here? No Sir. Absolutely right Sir... Sir! Sir, one minute! There are blood stains on the stairs and the door. Gopal, I'll call you later... You come along. Key? It's missing. You can break the lock. Very good! Thieves break locks. Not cops! Parched eyes will see water everywhere! It's just rust, not blood! And what's this? On the stairs? That? That's blood! Yes Sir... I've left Sir... I'm in the jeep. Mr. and Mrs. Kumar, you want a divorce on mutual consent. But before giving you a 6 month trial separation... I must ask why you want to separate? Mr. Kumar? I don't have any reason as such. Mrs. Kumar? You filed the court papers didn't you? If there's no reason to separate then there's no reason to be together either... We sleep together and wake up together for no reason. Fight for no reason. Love each other for no reason. Our relationship died years ago. And we're rotting... in the stench of the corpse... again for no reason. We also had affairs... Would you also like to know whom with? Not really... Go ahead, tell her. I will if she grants us the divorce faster. Always great at bullshitting. Please turn that off. Hello? Yes... What? We showed him the blood stains on the lock yesterday. He ridiculed us. My uncle finally broke the lock. Mr. D K Gogia... Retired police officer. He came as soon as I called him. Identify the body please. Took it from all angles? It does look like Khempal... Wow! 'Looks like'? What do you mean? Worked for you for two years, didn't he? Can you come up? I can't come home with the ashes. Panditji has said not to... Leave it in the car. I'm not leaving her alone. Do you remember what Khempal was wearing last night? Pant and? Er... A green T-shirt? - Now one with Pankaj... - Okay. One more... Sir! Sir check this out... Hold on... I'll call later... Would you look at that! Guess the case is solved! Pandey! - Call the forensics department. - Yes sir. The body is Khempal's. Alright. And this handprint? Yours? Sorry. The Shruti Tandon murder case keeps twisting and turning. A new body has been found today. Apparently this is the body of the servant... who was presumed to be the killer until now. Name? Name? Shruti Tandon. Age? 14 years. Date of birth? 24th March. Date of death? 15th March. Time of death? Sir? Time of death, please? Sir? Sir the killer is very clever... Does that mean we are buffoons? If we don't do something quick, like Nandhari, this case too will go to the CDI. And if I get transferred... I will not go alone. Either find the killer, or find another job! Yes Sir! Fresh arrivals... First she was hit on the head... with a hammer or a rod... twice. She must've fallen unconscious. Then almost half an hour later... very carefully, as if by an expert... right at the jugular vein... a long cut. Number one. And then for satisfaction, another small late cut... number two. And the servant? A Xerox copy. Xerox copy indeed. What happened? Sir it's me, Dhaniram! One minute sir. Sir... a glass broke in the other room... you were in deep sleep, tired after a long day's work... and you still woke up, immediately! SQ? Sir... two people died in the next room... yet Daddy and Mommy kept snoring away. Just think about it Sir. Check out this email. This girl is apologizing to her father - 'I'm sorry Daddy, I won't do it again'. What was this mistake you think? And not just one mistake, but three of them. The three mistakes of Chetan Bhagat... she was reading this. We found it in her room. And here is the internet company's report. They said, even hours after the girl's death... the internet router kept switching on and off. So if Daddy and Mommy were sleeping... and the girl was dead... who was switching the router on and off? The girl's ghost? Damn right! There were four people in the house... two are alive and two dead. What are you trying to say? Just that there were two murders that night... and both of you heard nothing... Not a sound? The AC in our room is so loud that you can't hear any outside noise. Wow that's convenient and a hell of an AC! So I guess the noise inside the room can't go outside either eh? The horniest guy I know is actually Shruti's father. Really?! The female doctor in his clinic... Sunita madam? That's the one. He used to hook up with her. Unbelievable! You loved your daughter a lot didn't you? And your wife? What? Our marriage is just fine. Of course, of course! Every man loves his wife... And if he doesn't, he at least... pretends like he loves his wife... And Doctor Mrs. Nathani? Did you love her too? Are you insane?! Shrieking won't help... I'm a happily married woman! I know... Sir I've also heard that this loving couple used to indulge in some sex switcheroo... What? You know what they say in English... You know... switching wives... Wife... soap... Wife swapping?! How is all this connected with Shruti's murder? Oh it is connected... from both ends. Shruti got to know what you two were up to... She had become sad... always sad. It's a tragedy dear... poor girl was suffering silently. She could neither tell her friends nor her relatives... so who else? Khempal. He was very afraid Sir. He had even told me his life was in danger. From who? It was her birthday 8 days later... but we gave her gift early... You have seen the videos from that night... we loved her a lot. For her birthday she had... planned a sleepover... with her friends. Planned what with friends? Sleep? What is that? All the kids spend a night together at one friend's place. Alone. Without parents around? And what do they do the whole night? You see, all these things... are because of the internet... it's a wretched place, this internet. Shruti - that's the girls name. Correct. She died on 15th March. And the time? They said she died at 2:00 am. Perfect. Make me a photocopy of this. If you didn't kill her... how do you know she died at 2:00 am? Hold it! We're from the Anti-Corruption Bureau. Hey Guru! JK! What are you doing here mate? Got a deputation coming up. Okay! Where are you off to? Probably CDI. But what are you doing here? The double murder case... that young girl and the servant. Ah yes yes Yes"- ... Just reporting to the high command. Any leads? We are working on it. We have cracked it Sir! Sorry Sir. I've got some fine malt for you - imported! Why don't you come by? Day after tomorrow? Done. - Done. Thank you. - Okay dear. It's been 10 days! What has the police been doing about this case? Wait... wait... wait... We are pleased to announce... that we have solved the double murder case... of Kruti and the servant. Its, Shruti not Kruti. Sir, Shruti. Our investigation has discovered that both the murders have been committed by the same person. He found Kruti... I mean Shruti and Khempal in an objectionable though not compromising position. Mr. Ramesh? We need to get some identification done. After seeing his daughter and his servant together, Dr. Ramesh killed them both in a fit of anger... though he is as characterless as his daughter was! What I say, he is as characterless, as his daughter was... [Reporter] What do you mean characterless? There's a new twist and a new killer in the double murder case. This is a simple and straight case of honor killing. Nutan? Where are you both? Where is Ramesh? We're in a police building... they've taken Ramesh in for some identification. Listen to me... they're saying he killed her! They're saying Ramesh killed Shruti and Khempal! What! What do you mean? Who is saying that? Listen. Police say Shruti and Khempal's murderer is none other than Shruti's father Ramesh Tandon. This is a simple and straight case of Honour Killing. Where is Ramesh? He's inside. Ma'am, you're not allowed there. What do you mean not allowed? I'm his wife! Open the door! What happened? My husband Dr. Ramesh Tandon, he's been locked up inside. There's no one inside, take a look... Satisfied? I want to speak to my lawyer. A lawyer is of no use now. Confess, and you'll get away with a lighter punishment. Yours is the rarest of the rare cases. You'll be hung, and it'll be granted by a fast track court. Why would I kill my own daughter? I've already told you why you did it. Should I also tell you how? You were working on your laptop till late that night. You drink every night, anyway... But that night you had a few extra, perhaps... Khempal, get some ice. Khempal. Nutan... help please! After committing both murders, you cleaned the blood in the room... wiped your fingerprints off everything. The bed... the room... you dressed it all up very nicely. Satisfied with everything, you relaxed with another drink. Would you like to confess now? Please... Please.. let me talk to my wife... lawyer... I didn't do this... I didn't kill my daughter... Please believe me! Sir please! Please... I did not kill her. Please Sir... Please! This is the compound! This is where it happened! Shruti was killed here! This is the house where Shruti was born... this is the room where she grew up. This is the room where that bloodcurdling nightmare happened! This is where Shruti was brutally murdered... where a father was overcome by anger and reacted violently... when he saw his daughter with the servant in a compromising position! A street dog barking at night keeps us awake... and their daughter was murdered in the next room yet they never woke up? It's not just fishy... it's a fishmarket! We all have boyfriends... but an old man? Yuck! And suddenly one morning, our family was finished... Before we could even mourn over our loss, they arrested him. Shruti was Ramesh's everything. He had never even so much as slapped her, yet the police, media everybody is saying... I have faith in the legal system. I hope justice is done. Of course. The day the sky is unscathed the face of the moon unblemished, the day Time awakens justice! Justice! Justice shall be sewed! If you have just lost your child... that also under really horrible circumstances... How can you be so clinical and so logical? I saw Mrs. Tandon's interview on your channel. I felt as if perhaps she isn't even their own daughter... she may be adopted... I suggest we should have a DNA test done. DNA test suggests Delhi's famous socialite Shoma Ray. Blood relation or not... the police has no right to defame such a small child, who is dead! I think that policeman should not be allowed to remain on his post. After going through the case details, the Home Ministry has requested the CDI to take over the case... Based on the findings of the CDl's investigation... further action will be taken against whomsoever it may be. After the embarrassing work by the police, the CDI team has now arrived in the area. The case will now be handled by. CDI joint director Ashwin Kumar. Doctor, this is the girl's room... that's the servant's room... let's get cracking! Found anything? 2-3 bottles of beer and wine, and some toiletries in the bathroom... 'Serve you parents... take them to the four holy shrines' 'Feeding a cow would help rid the house of evil spirits' 'Feeding a dog will defeat your enemies' Did Khempal drink? Occasionally or everyday? He never touched alcohol. He smoked beedis though, on the terrace. Sir? Could you come here for a second? Okay... Whose bottles are these? I don't know... Sir these bloodstains are not only between the terrace and Tandon's flat... they are on the lower floors as well, going down. They could have been made when the police was bringing the body down? Possible, Sir... totally contrary to the FIR. That means Khempal walked to the terrace himself... alive... Ah! We only need some background music now... You are truly Sherlock Holmes, Vedant! You flatter me Sir! Have a seat. Ahh goddamn it! You fool! Dr. Tandon, I'm Ashwin Kumar I'm handling your case... What time did you go to sleep on the night of 15th March? Around 11 pm... That night, the internet router switched on and off a number of times between 11:30pm and 6am... Any explanation? No. What time did you wake up the next morning? Khempal? Khempal? Wait a minute... The number you've called is unavailable. His phone isn't connecting. Sit for five minutes. Madam? You have the duplicate keys right? Yes... Throw them from the balcony, I'll go down and catch it. Okay- Ramesh! Shruti! Shruti! - Madam! Look at what Khempal has done! - Sir a byte? We didn't even get enough time to cry and mourn her death... They say... after we killed her... we cleaned her blood... wiped our fingerprints... cleaned her private parts... and drank whiskey... I wouldn't even be able to inject her gums before treating her cavities... and they're saying I slit her throat... There were two murders beyond your bedroom wall... you didn't hear anything at all? I have told the police already about our bedroom AC... it had been faulty since many days... it makes so much noise that it's impossible to hear anything outside. Sorry... what did you tell the police? You couldn't hear anything? Nope. Sir, a normal AC runs at 50 - 75 decibels, this AC is reaching 85 - 90 decibels... it is impossible for any outside noise to be heard inside. Hey Basu! Hope A. R. Rahman doesn't steal you away from us! Chief! There's a bit of confusion... The bloody hand print on the terrace... there's no analysis report on it. Why not? No idea what these jokers have done. Dhaniram? Yes Sir... Where has the print vanished? There was unseasonal rain on 18th March... it must have washed away. But the forensics department says they never got any information about a blood print. That's weird... I gave it myself... I think there has been some misunderstanding. - You informed Forensics, right? - Yes sir, absolutely. - How? - We phoned them. Who phoned them? I had told Pandey... - Pandey, you called Forensics, right? - Yes sir, absolutely sir... but my outgoing was blocked so I told Suresh to do it. Sir I had gone with you on the PM duty, but I'd told Qureshi to do it. - And where's Qureshi? - He's gone home for his daughter's wedding... You, bloody good for nothing idiot! What am I supposed to say to Sir now? Say sorry to the boss now! Sorry, Sir... It's okay. But next time there's a murder and the killer leaves a bloody hand print.. Just be more careful about it, okay? - Yes sir... - Very good! How do you know she died at 2:00 am? Sir? Time of death? Sir, if you don't tell me the time of death... I cannot complete the rituals of immersing the ashes. - Panditji... - the death occurred between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am. You could enter it as 2:00 am. 2:00 in the morning I just made a rough guess... I'm going to ask a few questions... just answer in a simple yes or no. Is your name Ramesh Tandon? Yes. Is your wife's name Nutan Tandon? Yes. Are you sure your husband has not killed your daughter Shruti? Yes. Did you suspect there was anything between Shruti and Khempal? No. Is your husband short tempered? No. - Are you sure? - Mrs. Tandon? Yes. When you entered Shruti's room, was she alive? No. Shruti's door could be unlocked from the outside, only with a key? Yes. You left the key in the lock that night? Yes. Deliberately? No. Do you have anything to do with your daughter's murder? No! What's in this? Your things... My things,". Both of you sign here... Your trial separation period starts tomorrow... Thank you, I'll take your leave. Have you seen the film "ljaazat"? No... Why? Just asked... [Sings] Some of my things still remain with you.. So basically we get nothing. Nope. In such cases everything depends on the first investigation team... and as you can see, the first team did a bang up job... Any possible prints or DNA samples, they're all... Yes, I know, I know... it's all contaminated, the crime scene was heavily compromised... But I don't need a sermon, I need a solution Dr. Swamy! - I'm so sorry... - Damn! Jai Hind Sir. - Take a seat. - Whose idea was it? Which idea, Sir? The honor killing one... My experience Sir... the fruit of days and nights of hard work... it was a very difficult investigation... Very difficult. Ah, 'Investigation'! So you were the first one to arrive at the scene? Yes Sir. And what did you do? The servant was missing, so we began looking for him... You didn't call the forensics team to collect prints and samples? Sniffer dogs? Err... No Sir... Was there a cooler panel on Khempal's body? Er... why yes Sir, there was... Who must have kept it? Who would have kept it? So why didn't you take it for fingerprints? The cooler was heavy and... I was being treated for hemorrhoids... Oh! Okay Okay. You're cured now? From the piles? I'm better now Sir, thank you. Shall we check? Take off your pants... Huh? Take off your pants... TAKE THEM OFF! Dhaniram... Nutan called Khempal at 6:02 am on his cell... It rang, was answered, then disconnected, then switched off, right? Did you follow up with the mobile server? The servant was missing, so we assumed he was the killer... and began searching for him... Well done! There was a rod here... look for it. Look for the rod... Take off your pants! Sir, I've been a cop for ten years... Strip, and search for the rod... Sir, I've worked for ten years... At 06:02 when the phone connected, where was it? I don't know Sir! Within the radius of the crime scene! Can a dead man answer his phone? No Sir. Did you find out who answered the call? No Sir! Not a single fingerprint is clear... You morons call this an 'investigation'? I'm sorry sir... You turned the crime scene into a fish market! Passers by... relatives. .. Neighbours... journalists... all strolling around like it's a public garden! If you had a little intelligence, even a minuscule ounce of it... this case would've been solved right then! I'm sorry Sir... I was facing a lot of pressure... Was any of Shruti's blood found on her parents' clothes? Yes Sir. Any of the servant's blood? No Sir. The blood of both the victims was found in the room? No Sir, only the girl's blood... The parents had cleaned up the servant's blood... What was the color of the girl's blood? Red? Must've been red, right? Yes Sir... And the servant's was blue? That's how they must've cleaned only the servant's blood, right? By cleaning up all the blue stuff? Even if a drop of the servant's blood had fallen in the room... and even if they had cleaned it... the forensic scientists would have still found out. This 'honor killing'... whose bright idea was it? Speak up. Ramesh Sir used to talk on the mobile phone for hours... with Sunita Madam. And... Whenever Nutan Madam used to be out of station for her lectures... They used to lock themselves inside the clinic and... What did they do? I guess they would chat... Is that what you guys call it? Oh Sir, you're funny... How many years have you worked with Tandon? I guess... around four years... What else did you see? There was a depression in the cot... like someone had sat on it. A few bottles... glasses... and the toilet was so dirty! Like the Jamuna ghat! But surely... there were other people in the house that night... Did you notice anything unusual in Dr. Ramesh's behavior? No, I don't remember... Anything unusual at work? Kanhaiya! - Yes Sir? - What is this? What the hell is this? Haven't you learned anything all these years? Can't even make a cast properly! If you can't do your job properly then leave! This happened a week before Shruti's death... I'd never seen Ramesh so angry... B! It was very strange because it was a very small thing... All of Tandon's staff... everyone in the colony servants, maids... round everyone up immediately. Yes Chief. If any of you lie... you'll be held as accomplice for the murder... The killer will be hung... and the liar will get life imprisonment. I've already said everything I know. I didn't have much to do with Tandon Sir... At times Shruti baby used to give me some errands to run and that's it. Sir, I'm an insomniac... that's why I work as a watchman. Sometimes these people would meet in Khempal's room and play cards. Kanhaiya and Khempal are from the same village. I don't know anything, I'm just the laundry guy. Yes, I have a boyfriend Sir... but he's married to someone else. Sir I think the Doctor only has committed the murder. That night no one entered or exited the house. Whoever won the card game would buy drinks for everyone. Yes Sir I remember... Kanhaiya was very angry the day the Doctor shouted at him... Enough is enough! He called me a b in front of everyone... How could he?! I will make him pay for this one! Relax... He just lost his temper... He's a good man... I will take my revenge at any cost... I will show him who the real b is! Are you sure about this? Sir, whatever the parents have said so far in the investigation, has turned out to be true. Nutan had called Khempal in the morning... Then the AC sound test in the room... They even passed the polygraph tests without a hitch. You better hope all this turns out to be wrong. Or the torture and injustice that the parents have been put through... One won't be able to make amends for it... Even. Ashwin... Have you seen the statue of justice? It is blindfolded... and one hand holds a weight balance... People often don't notice that the other hand holds a sword. The sword in the hands of justice is us... us cops... But in the last 60 years, the sword has become rusty... And until the rust is cleaned off, this is how it will be... how it will stay. I'm retiring on the 19th of next month. I know... You have 32 days... to clean the rust off the sword. The day the sky is unscathed the face of the moon unblemished, the day Time awakens justice! Justice! Justice shall be sewed! Nothing in here... I'll check on the other side. Basu! Find anything? Looking Sir. - Ashwin... - Please keep this. Hey... What... is this? I think we've found our murder weapon... Yes Vedant... We've got permission for the Narco test... Good... very good! Investigative officers are not allowed in Narco tests. Doc I'm on the verge of solving this case... I just need one breakthrough! Pestering like a child! You know I can't help you with this... Okay, could you give me your phone? Who are you calling? Calling myself. I think he picked up... Please speak! Hello... Dr. Swamy? What is this? This is a live telecast... Don't hang up... We're not breaking the law, okay? If I need to ask any questions I'll text doctor Mohanty. Thank you! This is Sodium Pentathol. You will feel a bit drowsy... but you will remain awake. He is stable... you can begin now. Kanhaiya? Kanhaiya? Yes Sir. Tell us something about Shruti and Khempal? Was there really something going on between them? Kanhaiya? No Sir. He loved her like his own daughter... Then? RP was the one who loved her... Who is RP? Rajpal... Nathani Sir's driver. When was the last time you met Khempal? At the Rockhouse... What is Rockhouse? 'Resham... Resham... Resham Resham..' Kanhaiya... pour me another one... Make another one! What the hell Kanhaiya! Worked for so long and still haven't learned a thing? This is funny huh? Piss me off some more and I'll pull the doctor's entrails inside out right now! Quiet guys... quiet down! Everyone is asleep. Everyone is asleep! My love must be awake though eh? Stop talking loosely about the girl! She's like a daughter to me... Sure, like a daughter... Sorry father-in-law! That's enough! Leave now... I need to sleep... Get some more booze... this is empty... From where? From the doctor's bar... He got scared! I'll lose my job... I'll buy you a new bottle in the morning... I promise. Wait I'll get it. What the hell are you guys doing? Get back inside. Let's get back inside! Cheers. - One more drink please. - Are you crazy? Just one more... Last! Khemu uncle? Stop him! Keep quiet! Papa! Quiet! Make her quiet. Are you mad! What to do?! Hit her! Kanhaiya... Quiet! Hold her down! Hit her hard with the Khukhri! Kanhaiya... Kanhaiya... Did you kill her with the Khukri? Did you murder her with the Khukri? Kanhaiya! Madam... Please stop! Call up doctor Mohanty. Hello... Hello Ashwin... I'm at work. Oh sorry, I'll call later. No it's ok... tell me... Do you remember the name of my migraine pills? The Doctor is not answering his phone... Relpax. Yes, thank you I just couldn't remember... Are you watching the film 'ljaazat'? Yes... Chief! What happened? His BP has crashed. Give the phone to Dr.Swamy. Hello... Just a little while longer Dr.Swamy... We're almost there! - There is a problem...- I have to stop this! - It's been more than 3 hours... - Doctor... It will take weeks to get permission from the court... - Please. - I'm sorry Ashwin... I really can't help this. We have to stop this now. This is very dangerous. - I'm sorry Ashwin. I can't! - Rajpal... Do you watch Rockhouse? Yes... Without fail... When did you see it last? In Khemu's room. Do you remember which song you saw? Resham... Resham... Resham... Rajpal... Why did you kill Shruti? Shruti - why did you kill her? I... I didn't kill Shruti... Then? In fact I loved her very much... Everything went wrong... on that drunken night. What went wrong? Kanhaiya was the one responsible... Kanhaiya? Ask Bhakbhakaun... Bak... who? Bhak... Bhakbakau... He was there too... Who is this Bhakbhakaun? Bhak.. bakau... What the hell have you guys done?! Nothing happened! Don't worry! Look... look... She's breathing... she's still breathing... She just got scared and fainted. Everything will be okay... Hey Bhakbhakaun! I'll wake everyone up and tell them what happened! Are you crazy? We'll all be behind bars! Let's go to the terrace and think clearly... You're our brother... we'll do whatever you say... Come on! If you want to run away then run! I'm going to tell Sir everything! I don't care if I go to jail or get hanged! Khemu listen! My uncle is a cop back home... Once we cross the border no one will catch us! You met him at the wedding, remember? Who is this Bhakbhakaun? No idea Sir... Become a witness and you'll be saved... It's all a lie Sir... - I didn't do anything. - You shot me up with drugs and made me say whatever you wanted to hear... And made you sing too? Resham... Resham... Resham... Want to see a film? You said some interesting things in it. My lawyer says your film cannot play in court. What did you say? What does that mean? He sang the song right? So ask him. Don't touch me! Hey Vedant wait... No... no... don't... Don't touch me! Stop-". If our Welfare Group gets to know, they won't spare you... It doesn't matter if the film plays in court or not... But your 'The End' is certain. Chief! The TV channel has confirmed... that song was telecast on their Rockhouse program that night. Who the heck is this Bhakbhakaun? Call all of them again for questioning. Sir. Congratulations! The blood found on Kanhaiya's pillow cover... it matches with Khempal's blood! - Great! - They are sending a formal report. Congrats indeed! This is my boy! My Bond! - Yes... I'm your boy... You're happy Sir! We'll miss you... I'll miss you... I'll just come... So who's going to take over after you? JK! This guy will take over... But he'll never overtake me. Rama... you'll never change! And you? Will keep changing! Like a chameleon! Sometimes red... sometimes yellow... sometimes blue... May I request the outgoing director to come up here on stage. - Come on, let's make you green now. - Green? The jealous green! Excuse us. My heart is heavy, and simultaneously light too... Heavy because... I can't be with you anymore... Light because I don't need to deal with you anymore... No more! For forty years... I have... just one word to give you... Thank you! And for my good friend, your new Director... a Parting gift! Ladies and gentlemen... During the tenure of yours truly... the double murder case... has been solved! Well done! Hit her hard with the Khukri. Khempal called the cops? We killed him before he had the chance. How did you kill Khempal? With the Khukri. Well... This is all very good, Ashwin. - Congrats! - Thank you Sir. What is the main evidence on the chargesheet? We recovered... Sir... Sorry. The blood found on Kanhaiya's pillow cover... matches Khempal's blood. So if this is our main evidence... don't you think we should get this reconfirmed by the lab? Why sir? Narco tests are not admissible in court and I want to be doubly sure about this. Vedant, take the first flight to Ahmedabad, and submit the reconfirmation of the report by evening. You understand? Ashwin... Yes Sir... You can file the chargesheet day after tomorrow. - Happy? - Thank you Sir. Sir... Sir... tomorrow is my fiance's birthday... Take her with you. Sir tomorrow we... When is your promotion due? Still time for that... There's never enough time, Vedant. All the best! On the recommendation of Central Department of Investigation this court grants bail to Dr. Ramesh Tandon with the following terms and conditions: The applicant is to furnish a bond of Rs. 5 lakhs and securities of a similar amount. Yes Sir... Ashwin listen to this... Yes Vedant, carry on... Sir I don't know how these idiots could make such a huge mistake! - They say there's some typographical error... - What typographical error? Forensics collected pillow covers from Khempal and Kanhaiya's rooms. - Right? Right... They named Khempal's cover as Z-25 and Kanhaiya's as X-52. Now they're saying they've typed 2-25 as X-52 in the report by mistake. It's a typographical error. Which now means that the pillow cover with Khempal's blood was found in Khempal's room and not Kanhaiya's? Is that it? That's exactly what they're saying Sir! How can they say that? I collected the bloodied pillow cover myself from Kanhaiya's room! How's that possible? And how can anyone mistakenly type Z-25 as X-52 ten different times in the same report? I've been trying to tell them the same thing for hours. But they are adamant! Who's in charge there? Put me through to him... I'll kill that b! I will handle this officially don't worry. No no Sir... Let me... Vedant, scan and mail me those reports immediately! Hello... Listen... I will go myself... to Ahmedabad. No no... you don't have to go... I will handle it... And trust me... But how is that possible? - Are the Memos done'? - Yes. Turn off the gas. Bhabhakaun... Hey Bhabhakaun! Bhabhakaun! Bhabhakaun! Where has this Bhabhakaun gone? What did you just say? What is this Bhabhakaun? In Nepalese, stutterers are called Bhabhakaun. Where is Bhabhakaun? - Here he is. - - Where were you? - I had g.. gone to the b.. bathroom. Who is it? What were you doing? S..s... sleeping... Bhak.. bhak.. bhakaun? Why did I hit you? I... I don't know... You'll speak the truth, yes? Yes Sir... The truth... Yes... You'll testify in court? Will they hang me? No, they will probably let you go... if you tell them the truth. Alright? Y.. yes Sir... Shoot him! No.. no Sir please don't shoot me! We'll shoot you with a camera, is that okay? Y.. yes sir... Sir... I... I slept early that night... Khempal came to wake me up... Nandu wake up! Wake up! What the hell have you guys done? Nothing's happened! Don't worry... look! She's breathing... she's still breathing... She's just unconscious... Listen to me! When I reached there... Bhakbhakaun! By.. by then they had killed Sh... Shruti... - They who? - K.K.. Kanhaiya and Rajpal. You'll testify in court of your own will? Yes Sir... You think I'm a fool? What? Sorry? First you beat up and torture somebody, then force him to become an approver?! Sir he's ready to testify in the magistrate's presence! Then we chargesheet and the case is over! I don't know how Rama used to run things... but this will not happen in my command! Sir he's willing to testify on his own! You guys have turned this into a joke! With great difficulty this agency has built a reputation! I won't let it go to dogs! I will not tolerate this anymore! Look at this! - Look at this! - What is this? Look at it! You're off this case with immediate effect! Sir... Enough! I don't want any more words. This is.. Finished! Traitor! Ashwin! You can't do this Ashwin! Vinod! Come in! Take him away! Take this psycho away! - This is wrong! - Get out! You're suspended! Get out! Who is it Vaishali? I can't do it... What? I can't do it anymore... Do what? I just can't. Please don't let me go... Please... - Where? - I can't go back to my job! The CDI has failed to file a chargesheet within 90 days. And the court has released the accused in the Shruti murder case, on bail. Sources say the CDI will now start a new investigation with a new team. I'm sure all of you have heard a lot of stories about the Shruti murder case as well as Ashwin Kumar. So it's important that all doubts be cleared. I think... he got too emotionally involved with the case. The way doctors remain emotionally detached from their patients... We too, need to keep some emotional distance from our cases and subjects. So I request all of you... please... do not, like Ashwin let your personal lives get in the way of your investigation. Any questions? Good, so let's get back to work gentlemen. Thank you. - Sir, a small request. - Yes? Could we assign an investigative officer to the case? Why? Sir, I've been involved with the case along with Ashwin from the beginning... No matter how hard I try... I won't get an objective perspective on the case... It would be better if... an investigative office works on the case... and I observe from a distance. Do you have anybody in mind? Manohar or Bhattacharya? No, they have their hands full... Paul Sir? How long will you hide? How far will you run? I've caught most wanted criminals... You too cannot escape! Come out, come out, wherever you are! What's this? He's become invisible! You scoundrel! Come out, rogue! Give yourself up while you still can! Hello? .. - Good evening, Sir...- Sir, I'm on leave for two months... The wife has gone to her parents... Yes... Gotcha! I'll just need a couple of days to go through the files... It's an honor that you have considered me for this case Sir! What about Kuku? He'll be with me... but there's no problem Sir... A kid hanging around a murder investigation Mr. Paul? Sir, there's no one to take care of him after school... The Department can arrange a babysitter for you... No, it's not that... The thing is, he is not an easily manageable child... and actually, he is not even a child... Not a child? He's a demon! Sir... Sir, I need a demon... I mean a prosecutor... in the team from the beginning. Prosecutor? Why? To minutely verify all evidence is very imperative. Everyday. Mr. Sanga! We're together again! We don't want to repeat Ashwin's mistakes... No matter how diligently we investigate the case... ultimately, it is the prosecutor who has to prove it and win a conviction. Evidence and conviction are like mother and infant. A healthy mother ensures a healthy infant. You made a statement that Rajpal was with you till 12:30 at night? Yes. I was returning from Dehradun... Mr. Nathani and Rajpal picked me up from the station. I was fasting that day... so I had dinner at 12:00 and went to bed at around 12:30 am. How long does it take to reach Dr.Tandon's house from here? 40 minutes at the most. On foot? Yes. And by cycle? 20 minutes. Okay- I'm telling the truth Sir... that day Kanhaiya came straight home from work. Six of us sleep here... so if he had gone out and come in, someone would have woken up. Okay- Are you for real? I saw alcohol bottles in Khempal's room. And the cot was depressed? Yes. - And you? - What? How much pressure did you face? 2 lakhs? 5 lakhs? Kanhaiya! Kanhaiya! Did you kill her with a Khukri? Was he saying this or were you making him say it? Mind your tongue Mr.Paul! You're talking to a retired police officer! When we get a lead we have to prod... There's nothing wrong in this! It's not wrong, it's completely wrong! And unethical! Need permission to conduct Narco test on the parents Sir. Ramesh, did you enter Shruti's room at night? Did you tidy up the sheets after the murder? How did you kill Shruti, Ramesh? Did you clean the room afterwards? Sources say the CDI has been left red-faced. As per the Narco tests the CDI has found no evidence that connects the Tandon's to Shruti's murder. Both the husband and wife are clever scoundrels! They must've taken some antidote before the Narco tests... No wonder the Narco drugs didn't work on them. Are there antidotes for Narco tests? There aren't. But there could be... Don't forget... they're both Doctors! The ones testing them are also Doctors, Mr. Paul... I'm sure they were put through blood tests before the Narco. It could also be possible that they didn't commit the murders after all? Look at their faces... their eyes... Don't they look like murderers? But there are two of them in the photo. It's been one and a half years... I have no idea where it could be. The girl's forehead wound is 4x3 centimeters. And how big is this? Khempal was hit on the back of the head... and the girl on the forehead? God is great! And holy are the messengers of his faith! Missionary. What the hell are you making me do? You are bargaining like you're out to buy vegetables... - No Gogia Sir... Nothing like that. - This is not how business is done... - Please see what you can do. - This will be very difficult for me.- This is what it is... Now you decide. Thank you. In some cases... the process of intelligence gathering has to trample law... in order to achieve effective results. That's why some experts define information gathering... as a legal act carried out illegally. Somewhere we have to find a balance between... what the system wants you to do... and what you feel is right as an individual. Thank you. Time for the Q and A. If anyone has any questions for Mr. Kumar please proceed. Yeah, Sandeep... Sir, I was wondering... since you're such an accomplished officer of your agency... Why did you take premature retirement? What made you quit? I guess I couldn't find the balance. Call me if any one of you guys find it. Please... - Thank you Sir.- Sir, are you sure you dialed the right number? Ashwin, how are you? All well... The meeting I spoke to you about earlier... - Yes... - It's at 11:00 am tomorrow. Many of your fans will be present... - Alright? - Okay, I've read the reports from both teams, in detail... Both the conclusions are as different as warring political parties! One team says the servants are the killers, and the other says the parents did it. Now the ministry has to take some stand... - It's high time! - Either you convince each other... - Or convince me.- Ashwin? Sir, every investigation follows a prime rule - Inquiry, evidence and conclusion... You enquire for evidence and you come to a conclusion. Here everything has backtracked... These people first decided on the conclusion... then dug very hard for evidence. You worked hard as well Sir... to get the poor, innocent servants hung to their deaths. If they are innocent, what are you? There were four people in the house. Two are alive and two dead. - As simple as that. - Everyone's testimony has changed! The maid servant, the forensic expert, the postmortem doctor! So is it as simple as that? Yes it is! It happened! - How is it possible? - Guys... Please! Let's do one thing... The second team can present whatever new crucial evidence or testimonies - they have discovered... - The first team can examine the credentials. - Fair? - Fair enough. Mr. Paul... Sir... The biggest issue in this case is whether there was anyone else at home that night... - The first team says the killer came from outside, - killed Shruti, latched the door and ran. Right? Wrong. The first person to arrive at the crime scene... if I may call her the prime witness... The maid servant, Basanti... - After both the murders, the Tandon's - had been waiting for her to come. - Basanti came, rang the bell, - - the door was closed...- Then the key is thrown from the balcony... I'd like you to look at this door... - This door is between the two front doors, - and it opens into Khempal's room. Normally, there is a fridge placed against this door... But that morning the Tandon's had moved the fridge to be able to open the door. When Basanti turned to the stairs to get the key... Mrs. Tandon came out of this very door, opened the main door, - and went back to throw the key. - When Basanti came back up, the main door didn't need a key... it opened with just a push. The front door was latched from outside, just to show that someone had broken in, killed and run away... What followed was the Tandon's acting all shocked... When Basanti first came, did she push the main door to check if it was unlocked? Yes she did. Her statement doesn't say so. No problem, we can take her statement again. By blackmailing her like Gogia? Oh come on Ashwin! We don't torture people to make them approvers... Sir, do you understand what these people are trying to say? Just imagine... I'll throw you the keys. The moment Basanti turns to get the key, Nutan runs inside and does everything that they are saying... Put this back, I'll throw her the keys... Quick, let's go! We have to start crying now... Look what, Khempal has done. Such intricate planning! Two murders, one dead body on the terrace... dressing up the crime scene... Moving the fridge, opening the small door, latching the front door... throwing keys, moving the fridge again... All in a flash! Are they Spiderman and Superwoman? What are they? And after all that planning, the blood-stained whiskey bottle on the table... they didn't clear that up? How come? Because they weren't professional killers. Sir, it's simple... if a father sees his daughter's dead body... will he cry standing outside the room or run to hug her? Has your daughter died? Do you know what it feels like to lose a child? And you do? To have a daughter, you first need a wife... You don't even have that. We're talking about a human reaction here... That's exactly the point! Human reactions can be different... How can we generalize this? Sir, please note... Khempal's throat was slit completely... in a full circle. The girl's was only half slit. SQ? Human reaction. She was their daughter... Emotional attachment... So while murdering his child the doctor said... 'Sorry dear, I'm slitting your throat...' 'Hope you're not in pain?' 'Almost done...' 'Just this one vein and you'll die!' Let's be serious guys... Sorry... but you're right, their whole theory is a joke. The internet router switched on and off three times that night... That means the parents were awake. Next day when all hell broke loose, and no one used the computer... even then the router switched on and off... The router is made in India. It turns on and off at its own will! The computer was actually used that day... What for? Shruti's friends used it... Why? To clean up disreputable literature... What? Porn... Pornographic material... - You don't know? - Okay... Testimony? Off the record. Why? What would people say about the girl? Oh... Compassion! So Mr. Compassionate, what was the motive for the murder? Sudden rage. Why? The doctor found his daughter and his servant in a Sacrilegious Disposition. Then he lost his self-control and... Sacrilegious Disposition? Missionary position. - He then took the golf club and...- first the servant, then the daughter... The golf club was in the girl's room? No, in the servant's room... So the doctor found them in a sacre... sacremonious? Sacrilegious disposition? Yes... in that disposition... And he ran out of the room to fetch his golf club... And by the time he came back, the servant and the girl... were still in the same position? Sacrilegious disposition... Sir, be serious! We are doing serious business... Can we go on please? He wants to memorize this word! Sir, let's carry on please... Carry on guys... Sacrilegious. Paul Sir... According to you, the girl's computer was full of disreputable literature... - Porn. - Yeah, now you know... It was full of disreputable literature... Yes. And she had a boyfriend too... Then why would she need to be in a. Sacrilegious Disposition with a 50 year old servant? Not a need, but a revenge against her parents... Revenge for what? She was aware of her parents activities... What activities? Wife swapping- That was the only way she could retaliate and hurt them and have sex with the servant. This was the angle used by the first police investigation... And the Chief... who embarrassed the whole police department in that press conference... He was your batch-mate, right? What do you mean? Nothing... Then why do you say it? 'The heart is familiar with the world's ways...' 'True friends are always handy to save face...' Learn to lose gracefully at least... Ashwin, come on! When Khempal's body was found on the terrace... he was wearing his slippers. So was he wearing his slippers while in the Sacrilegious Disposition? Or he was like 'Oh Doctor... you caught me but don't kill me here... let's go to the terrace... I'll just get my slippers...' Anyway, Sir... Rajpal's house is 20 minutes away from the Tandon's house... Not a single watchman saw him entering or exiting the building. Even if we accept your theory... at 12:30 am, he was at Nathani's house... We have the testimony. That means he reached the Tandon house at 12:50 am. As per the postmortem, the murder happened between 12 and 1 at night... The same doctor has given the time of murder as 12 noon. He was just confused... When the girl was in school... - He jumbled up the AM and PM...- Screw his AM and PM! His reports have changed four times in three years! Either the vaginal swab is contaminated, - or the finding is 'subjective'... - First they said the Khukri killed her, now they say it's a surgical instrument. In the Narco tests the servants gave a detailed account of the murders... You did a Narco test on the parents. Did you find anything? The first team's Narco report is fabricated... These are the CDs of the original report... You can have a look... As per your Narco tests, the murderers destroyed Khempal's and Shruti's cell phones. Six months later the girl's phone turned up in U.P. state. My team has also recovered the murder weapon - the Golf club. - Recovered? - Yes. Mr. Tandon found it in his house and brought it to you himself! If this master planner had used it to murder two people, wouldn't he have destroyed it? These people have created imaginary stories about everything! Are you going to tell him about the typographical error? What is that? A pillow with Khempal's blood was recovered from Kanhaiya's room... That was recovered from Khempal's room only... the forensics made an error while typing. And you reminded them of this.. These guys wrote a letter to the forensics to ask... if there are any typographical errors. And it's not AN error... it's errors! Twenty errors of the same word on the same report! Can I see those photographs? These numbers have been given by you, not by the forensics team. So let the court decide! What will court do unless we make a decision? Can the case be proved in court? We only have circumstantial evidence... so it will be difficult. To be honest... No one except the parents could have committed the murders... But that they ARE the murderers, this we can neither say... nor prove... The case could have been proved... because one of the servants was ready to become an approver... But it is all past now. It is better to free ten criminals, than imprison one innocent... There seems to be no other option but to close the case... 'It's better to end a story on a good note... in case it cannot be brought to a logical end...' File the closure report. Fairly. Yes Sir. Though our investigation clearly points... to the parents as Shruti's killers... the evidence collected is not strong enough... to file a chargesheet against them. The CDI therefore requests the closure of this case. I will never accept this Closure Report! I'll go to the Supreme Court if I have to! Murderer! Get the car... Your report says it would be difficult to prove the parents guilty in court... Difficult? It's not impossible, right? Your Closure Report is rubbish... It won't be accepted. Charge the parents with murder and begin the trial. Is it lunchtime yet? Despite lack of solid evidence the court has ordered that the Tandon's be tried for murder. - This has shocked not just the Tandon's, - - but also the CDl.- The accused Dr. Ramesh Tandon and Dr. Nutan Tandon are convicted under sections 302 and section 201 read with section 34 IPC. Dr. Ramesh Tandon is also convicted under section 203 lPC. Under section 302 IPC both the accused are fined Rs.10,000/- each and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life. No, I want to open it now! Please! Okay- Thank you! Wow! - Camera! - Papa say something for my birthday quickly! Happy birthday Shruti! When dreams slither through the Iatticed eyelashes of familiar eyes... it feels like she's alive it feels like... she's alive
