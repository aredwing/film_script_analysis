These compact, highly-trained detachments may be employed... ...to assist friendly governments in counterinsurgency operations. They may also be utilized in unconventional warfare. In training, survival under varying conditions is stressed. I speak Norwegian and German. I am Executive Officer. My duties include the supervision... ...of all administrative and logistical matters. In the event the detachment were to be split into 2 teams... ...I would command one of these. I speak German and Spanish. That about covers the central area, Colonel. As you know, the C detachment commander in that area is Colonel Franks. In the southern area there has been approximately... ...a 30/ increase in our operational detachments over the past year. Sir, since you served as a C detachment commander... ...I won't elaborate on the southern corps. Thank you. In summation... ...the bulk of our problems seem to be in the northern areas of the country. This concludes our briefing. Any questions? I think not, Colonel. Thank you, gentlemen, that will be all. You stay behind. Captain. Leave the Jeep. - All right, Mike, what's on your mind? - What do you mean? Something's bothering you. What? When do you expect me to take over, sir? Lmmediately. Why? When I get over there, they're going to snow me under with paperwork. And I'd like to get oriented to the critical area. - I want to look at those forward camps. - How much time do you need? - I'll need 3 weeks. - You got it. And when you see old Cactus Thomas, who's over there now, give my regards. Thank you, sir. Hello, Bill. Morning, Mike. Up early? Not for Airborne. This yours? Yes, sir. - These yours? - Why don't you ask them? - Who are you? - Airborne! - How far? - All the way! - I'll get part of them. - You always do! I am combat engineer specialist, with the same basic knowledge... ...as the engineer sergeant. I'm cross-trained as medic and weapons. I speak French and Vietnamese. I'm radio operator supervisor. My duties: Maintaining a communications link with my next higher detachment... ...and supervising communications training for native military personnel. I'm trained in intelligence and weapons. I speak Danish and some Norwegian and English. Detachment, attention! Muldoon, take over! I'm Master Sergeant Muldoon and this is Sergeant McGee. Between us, we've had 3 tours of duty in South Vietnam... ...which makes us experts, so we've been ordered... ...to volunteer to answer questions here for you today. I'm Hume Parkinson. I happen to be a newspaperman. Perhaps you can answer a question many of our subscribers ask. We'll try. Why is the United States waging this ruthless war? Foreign policy decisions are not made by the military. A soldier goes where he is told and fights whomever he's told to. You agree with that, Sergeant McGee? The Green Beret's just a robot with no personal feelings? Can I have your name? - George Beckworth, Chronicle-Herald. - Thank you, sir. Sybil Sutton, Washington Sentinel. Will you please answer that question? Do they press a button? Do you do what you're told to do without any personal feelings or opinions? We have feelings and opinions. It's hard not to form them out there. Everyone knows the South Vietnamese are fighting and dying for their cause. As soldiers, we can understand the killing of the military... ...but the extermination of the civilians... ...the murder and torture of women and children... I guess horrible things happen in war. But that doesn't mean to say they need us or want us. I'll try to answer that question for you. Let me put it in terms we all can understand. If this same thing happened here in the United States... ...every mayor in every city would be murdered. Every teacher that you've ever known would be tortured and killed. Every professor you ever heard of... ...every governor, every Senator... ...every member of the House of Representatives... ...all would be tortured and killed, and a like number kidnapped. But in spite of this, there's always some little fellow out there... ...willing to stand up and take the place of those who've been decimated. They need us, Miss Sutton. And they want us. Sergeant, I'm Gladys Cooper, a housewife. It's strange we've never read of this in the newspapers. Newspapers! You could fill volumes with what you don't read in them. That's sometimes very true. But how do you know we should fight for this government? They've had no free elections. They have no constitution. 6 months ago a committee was appointed to form a constitution. Still none. The school I went to taught us that the 13 Colonies... ...with proper, educated leadership, all with the same goal in mind... ...after the Revolutionary War, took from 1776 to 1787... ...11 years of peaceful effort... ...before they came up with a paper that all 13 colonies would sign. Our present Constitution. That's very good, Sergeant. But there are lots of people... that believe this is a war between the Vietnamese people. Let's let them handle it. Let them handle it, Mr. Beckworth? Captured weaponry. From Red China. Chisom K Fifty. Chinese Communists. S. K. S., Soviet-made carbine. Russian Communists. Ammunition. Czechoslovakian-made. Czech Communists. No, sir, Mr. Beckworth... ...it doesn't take a weight to fall on me or a hit from those weapons... ...to recognize that what's involved is Communist domination of the world. Ladies and gentlemen, pardon us... ...for giving a little more than a "yes" or "no" answer to your questions. Are there any more? Section "C," take the blue trail... ...and sections "A" and "B" the red trail... ...for further orientation... ...on the capabilities of the Green Beret. Kowalski, break out the gear. Okay, Sarge. - Colonel. - Yes? Your brainwashed sergeant didn't sell me. Didn't sell you what? Didn't sell me on the idea that we should be involved in Southeast Asia. You ever been to Southeast Asia? No, I haven't. Sergeant Provo requests to speak to you. Provo? Heavy weapons specialist. I'll see him. Sir, Sergeant Provo requests permission to speak to the Colonel. At ease. I appreciate your seeing me, sir. I know how busy you are. I understand you're picking 2 "A" teams for Vietnam. Is that true, sir? We might be, and we might not. I think it might be, sir. Since I haven't been picked, I'm volunteering. You're a heavy weapons specialist. Not if I can find a light one, sir. Why are you volunteering, Sergeant? I'm a soldier. That's where the action is. We'll let you know. Thank you, sir. Sergeant McGee. Pull his record. I did. He's a good man. - Thanks, Doc. - Yes, sir. There he is. Right on time. Quite a character. A tour in Korea... ...a year in Vietnam... ...speaks 3 languages, but are you sure about this soldier? What do you mean? I checked his jump record. Every time, the jumpmaster has to push him out. That's why I want him. He won't quit. Hold it, soldier. Nice day. Yes, sir. Out of your territory, aren't you? Yes, sir. What are you doing here? Watching a basketball game, sir. And what were you doing here yesterday? And the day before? And the day before that? You spend so much time here you'd think you wanted to join our outfit. No, I don't think I'd care to join the Fifth Group, sir. I'm sorry to hear that, soldier. Muldoon. - Yes, sir. - Carry on. - Mike, what's that? - That's the guy I was telling you about. Pull! Hello, soldier. - So you decided to volunteer. - My pleasure, sir. Good! Pull! Nice shooting, sir. That's normal. Why did your outfit always send you when they needed something? I guess I'm good at it, sir. But not good enough. You got caught. Yes, sir, your men did catch me. 1 time out of 100. You better hope that your luck holds out... ...because your first assignment is to go back to your outfit and bring back... ...everything you took. - You understand me, Sergeant? - Yes, sir. See to it. Carry on. Sergeant?! That's what the man said. Sergeant. Sergeant! Everybody hit the deck! Up and at 'em! Rise and shine! Up and at 'em! Let's go! Get the lead out! On your feet! Let's go! Come on, soldier, out of the sack! Everybody up! It's 3:30, let's go! On your feet, soldier, on your feet. Holy Toledo! It's only 3:30. 3:30? Is that right, Sarge? That's right, soldier boy. You'd better get some sleep. We got a lot of work to do tomorrow. On your feet, soldier, on your feet. What kind of a... You got 10 minutes to pack. Pack in 10 minutes? Takes me longer than that to get my heart started. - What are you doing? - I'm packing! You pack what Uncle Sam issued and that's all. You got 9 minutes. - Why the countdown? - You got 8. Where are we going? You'll get the word. On the way out, everybody grab his gear. Welcome to Da Nang. Hi, Mike. - Good to see you, Frank. - Me, too. - Captain MacDanial. - How are you? - I got the jeep right over here. - Fine. Captain, will you see the men get all their gear? Here we go. Hop in. - I've been on that plane for hours. - You'd rather walk? - I sure would! - Good, let's stretch our legs then. Reynolds, meet us at Colonel Cai's office and watch that weapon. Yes, sir. I'm sure glad it's you relieving me. - Don't hurry me. I got three weeks. - I know. That was a great idea. - How's your back? - It's coming along slow but sure. Be glad when I can move around and burn off some of this. This truck for us? That's service. Okay, grab your gear. Arthur E. Fuller. I knew that guy. Named a field after him. He won the Distinguished Service Cross. Posthumously. Better grab your gear. I suppose you'll take the long way back home. Go through Hong Kong, pick up a little yardage and some screens. No, I don't think so. My wife said not to bring anything she couldn't either cook or play with. - What's my opposite number like? - His name's Colonel Cai. He's a good man, resourceful, intelligent and has a lot of initiative. - Outstanding? - Outstanding! - Chung See Bado! Good to see you. - Thank you, sir. Glad you're in the outfit. Smart looking honor guard. I recognize most of them. Even those you don't recognize know of you. - How come? - They got the word. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Colonel Cai, Colonel Kirby. - I'm happy to make your acquaintance. - Thank you. Sit down. I have heard much about you from Colonel Morgan and others. If half of what I have heard is true, I'm positive we'll work well together. We build many camps, clobber many V. C. Affirmative? Affirmative. I like the way you talk. Let me get to the point. We have two new camps. Here and here. This one is all right. Everything is STRAC... ...a full complement of Montagnards and Special Forces. The other one? Camp A-107... ...code name two-niner Savoy. This camp we build in the heart of V. C. Country. One day is nothing. Next day we are there. Big surprise for V. C. Unfortunately, "A" camp 107's only about half-finished. The Viet Cong hit it with mortar fire 3 or 4 times a week. The villagers tell us that the V. C. Are making a big buildup across the border. We're hoping that weather does not keep us from having air support. Without it, Charlie can overrun camp. The "A" team's tour of duty will be up in 10 days. That puts that camp between the rock and the hard place until it's completed. I brought 2 "A" detachments with me. I could... ...leave one here to form a Mike Force... ...and take the other up for replacements. I think it's a good idea. I have to pay my respects to the General at 1500. - Nice to have met you. - Likewise. See you later, Colonel. - Sorry, I didn't see you come out. - That's all right. - Everyone looks at pretty girls. - I wasn't looking at them. I was thinking about that sign there. "In Honor of William J. Wallace." I noticed the buildings and streets around here... ...got the names of heroes on them. Dead heroes. It kind of sets a man to thinking. That it does. And I also think we'd better get moving. You all right? I'm still thinking about those name plates, sir. The ones about soldiers killed in action. My worry is that my name don't fit any of our buildings or streets. You got a real worry there. Must be tough... ...having a problem like that. "Provo's Barracks," "Provo's Commissary." You see what I mean? - No. - It just don't sing. If you think of something that does sing, you let us know. We'd want you to have the best. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. Remember me? - George... - Beckworth. This is Colonel Morgan. I took your suggestion. I came to see for myself. Good for you. They said at Group I could go, but it'd be up to you. - What do you think, Colonel? - Pretty hairy operation. I don't think this area's ready for writers. Hate to get one greased. - Is that the real reason? - Come again? My paper believes we shouldn't be in Vietnam. Afraid I'll see something to substantiate that belief? Be my guest. Good luck, Mike. With joyous memories, we leave the mystical city of Da Nang! What gay adventure lies ahead! Brother... ...this trip is going to make LSD feel like aspirin. Mr. Beckworth... ...you going to write about us? - That's right. - What are you going to say? I don't know yet. Man, oh, man! Look at all those trees down there. My dog could go crazy! We have "A" teams out along the Cambodian and Laotian borders. They each built their own camp. We're headed for one of those now... ...Camp "A-107." There's our destination. Good to see you again. You know Lieutenant Sachs. - Captain MacDanial, your replacement. - That's good to hear. Sergeant Kenny, pick up the extra gear and the mail. If you gentleman will follow me, we'll get inside. You got about a 150 foot killing area here, Captain. The first thing I'd do... ...is cut that back another 300 feet. We've wanted to do that, but we've been short of help. We tried to get some engineers. They're all busy. I requested some Seabees. If that detachment ever gets here, you put them on that first thing. Mail call! Dodge City? You can buy it cheap. Those what they call pungi sticks? Yes, it's a little trick we learned from Charlie. But we don't dip them in the same stuff he does. Could increase the effectiveness of that concertina with more tanglefoot. - FRONT TOWARD ENEMY - The claymores are great. Got any more of them? - Double the number on the perimeter. - We'll get right on it. Brings us up to date. They mortared us again last night. It's becoming a fairly regular thing. - How many operations do you have out? - 3 recon and 2 ambush. - And that counterpart of yours... - Captain Nim. He's out with a patrol. The one that just got zapped. He'll be in tomorrow with 3 wounded. - Will you be staying with us awhile? - I'll be in camp, off and on. We fixed a place for you in the commo bunker. Not much, but it's dry. Good. After mail call, I've assigned my men... ...to get Captain MacDanial's team bedded down. He's a newspaper man. This is Captain Coleman. Mr. Beckworth is with the Chronicle-Herald. - Can you find a spot for him? - Affirmative. Take Mr. Beckworth here to my hooch, get him squared away. This way, Mr. Beckworth. Can I give you a hand? If it's all right, the lieutenant and I will stay with the team. This way, sir. The captain has the bottom bunk. We'll get somebody to make this one for you. - Is there drinking water? - Yes. I don't know if it's cold. It'll be fine, thank you. You've got a pad in the storage bunker. You can have mine in a few days. I hope. To the right here. You funny! I see you've made Hamchunk's "A" Club. You funny! You not. This is Hamchunk. He's become a permanent fixture around here. He's an orphan. Lived most of his life with missionaries 10 clicks south of here... ...until they were assassinated. Maybe you could use an interpreter. - Missionaries taught him English. - I don't want an interpreter. You number one. I choose you. I don't want to be chosen. - I don't think you have much choice. - Choice, Mr. Hobson? I haven't had a choice since I was selected for this... ...outfit. You get used to me. You funny. In here. What's the status of your crew-served weapons? We have two 81's, four 60's... ...twelve 30 calibers, three on each wall. One 4-deuce. Besides crew-served, we have six M-79's. No 50 calibers? I'd give an R and R in Bangkok for the smell of a 50. - You hear that, Sergeant? - Yes, sir. - Know where there are any 50's? - No, sir. Neither do I. You better tell Sergeant Petersen. I almost forgot, sir. Captain MacDanial needs more corrugated tin. It's been hard to come by lately. Yes, sir. I know, tell Petersen! Tell the scrounger. What happens if Charlie hits this camp before you get it completed? If he does, and he's too strong for us to handle... ...we have 3 LZ's within 4 clicks to send 10 choppers each to reinforce us. One is by that shale cliff you saw on your way in. And the second is to the west of here... ...near a deserted Montagnard village where some of these people used to live. The third is to the north near an old bridge. What if Charlie overruns the camp? In that case, sir... ...the camp is prepared to escape and evade on order... ...through places in the wire and mines... ...only "A" and Captain Nim know about. - My compliments. - Thank you, sir. Commander of this area runs everything by the book! And I am with him to the nth degree! And every piece of this equipment will be painted... ...and every piece of this equipment will be numbered... What in the hell is that? - You make good coffee. - Cholong coffee. - More coffee, Sergeant? - No, thanks. Brother! Boy, is it miserable out there. And believe me, it's sure in hell stay-awake weather. Don't you men have rain gear? Yeah, but it doesn't do any good in this lousy climate. Skipper! Savoy 3 is on the horn, sir. Savoy 3 to Savoy 6. - Over. - This is Savoy 3. I'm nearing home base. I've thrown smoke. Can you identify? I see the red smoke. Come on in. Give them a hand. - Morning, Max, Collier. - Morning, sir. - Hell of a mess! - Looks like we're going to float away. What's this outfit coming in? That's Captain Nim, your counterpart... ...with the patrol that just got zapped. Alert the dispensary. Tell them casualties are coming in. I'll go find Colonel Kirby. It was a close one. Get those casualties over to the dispensary. Let's go. Snap it up! The rest of you... ...get some dry clothes and chow, report for debriefing. Move it out! Fill me in. As you know, we were hit yesterday. Three casualties. This is sure Charlie's weather! But they didn't follow us. - You sure? - Affirmative. Skipper, I would like to look after my casualties. Sure. Come on. - What's the situation? - He'll be all right. More painful than serious, sir. I want you to meet the Camp Commander. Dai-uy Nim. Stay where you are, Dai-uy. Tran Nim. I've read your name on many reports. You're very active. We try, sir. Meet your new counterpart, Captain MacDanial. Welcome! We will have a good post here when it gets finished. I've no doubt, Dai-uy. Your outfit looks pretty beat up. - 11 days is a long patrol. - We're short of men. We've got everything we need except strikers. What seems to be the trouble? The natives have been so exploited by Viet Cong, they trust no one with a gun. Same old story. How many villagers are there in the vicinity? We've got 7. There were 5. And we've got 2 in camp. If you got all the villagers in, what would that do for you? That'd give us 3 to 5 hundred. - Better get on to SyWar about this. - When you leave, Dai-uy? Tomorrow. Hopefully. Da Nang, Nha Trang, Saigon and home! My home is in Hanoi. I'll go home too, someday. You see. First, kill all stinking Cong. Then go home. Will there be anything else? That's all, Nim. Thank you, sir. He sounds like he means it. He keeps score on the wall of his hooch. He personally greased 52 this year. Says he'll double it by next year... ...if all the yards get out of his way for a clear field to fire. I noticed a load of corrugated tin has miraculously appeared overnight. - Sergeant Petersen provided. - That's a good man you got there. - Sergeant Petersen say where he got it? - He said the good fairy left it. I hope he said, "The good fairy left it, sir!" Captain, will you join us in the commo bunker? - Good evening, Colonel. - Relax. Sit down. - My, it's a beautiful evening. - That it is. Captain Nim. Thank you. This would be great country... ...if not for the war. And the damn monsoons. Give me a beer, will you, Petersen. You won it all. Why ain't you in this game? Mr. Beckworth showed him 3 aces. Be sure and check the guard roster before you turn in. Good night. Good night, sir. Where's McGee? - Doc, you got the 4-to-6 watch. - Delightful! Thank you. Jim Beam! You're not feeding him that stuff? You sure it's good for him? You questioning... ...my professional competence? - He sure looks bad. - He's dying, poor old thing. - Can't even eat anymore. - What seems to be wrong? I'm not the best doctor in the world, but I'm the best one without a license. My diagnosis is plague, tuberculosis, old age... ...and no hope. He's tired... ...bone tired. The Captain's in there! Check the damage in the dispensary! Everything's all right here, Colonel! A near miss, but nobody hurt. - I think they've stopped. - Yes, sir. This is the usual procedure. About every other night. Harassment. It's pretty good shooting. Commo bunker, the dispensary, the team house. It's a sure thing that they have eyes inside our camp. Check gear, they hit the commo bunker. Lieutenant Green, form a recon patrol, ASAP! Petersen, come with me. Who is it? It's the captain, sir. Better... ...move him out of there. Colonel Kirby! Be right there. He was going to go home tomorrow, wasn't he, sir? All the way. - What do we got, Green, 10 pounders? - 10 pound warheads, sir. - Ready to go hunting? - Be a couple of minutes yet. I'll be gone about 3 hours. Mind the store. Don't worry. Two-niner Savoy. This is Savoy Eight. Over. Savoy Eight, this is Savoy Five. Over. This is Savoy Eight. I'm nearing the camp. Have thrown smoke. Identify. Savoy Eight, this is Savoy Five. I see green smoke. Come on in. Out. We'd better get out of the way of the copters. Those choppers are very important out here, aren't they? Couldn't win this war without them. I'm sort of new out here. What's this all about? Muldoon and MacDanial, in those choppers... ...fly low over the treetops and hope to draw V. C. Gunfire. You mean there are V. C. That close? Yes. Mr. Beckworth, I have V. C. In my own strike force. Pardon me. I have to check the perimeter. There they are, building a boat bridge. They're not Cong, they're hard-core regulars. You worry me. 3 tours of duty and you still act like a civilian. Sergeant Muldoon, I'm not a Marine. I believe in my comfort. We got the tin. What about the 50 caliber? Don't worry. Next drop. How'd you do it? A guy in Kho Sahn wanted 2 cases of bourbon. Bourbon! How'd you get 2 cases of bourbon? From a guy in supply in Bien Hoa. Why would he give you that much booze? He didn't give it to me. I traded him for it. Traded him what? I traded him a Montagnard crossbow... ...a number one address on Tu Do Street... ...and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals. And where did you get a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals? I made them. I work hard. I've gone to church. I was a Boy Scout. I was an Eagle Scout! He funny! How did you get in here? Where do you sleep? Where's...? Anywhere. All right, come here. - Colonel Kirby? - Affirmative! Lt. Jamison, 91st Navy Seabee detachment out of Cho Min. This is Captain MacDanial. We'd have come sooner, but the Marines wanted a strip up north. It's going to get a little hairy around here, Lieutenant... ...so we're glad to see you, late or not. The rest of my outfit will be coming with the heavy equipment. They set it down right where the work is. - How's that, sir? - Could you move that jungle back for us? Just say the word, and I'll move it to China. We don't need that much. Just a clear killing zone. Will do, sir. Arrange pads. How many men? Lucky number. 13. Hop to it! - I'd like to run an equipment check. - Go ahead. Sight for sore eyes. That thing sure does a day's work! Easier than mowing the lawn. Everybody's as busy as little bees. Hello, Charlie. Get me Captain Nim and Colonel Kirby. The charge? This man was pacing off the distance between the wall and the team house. We could've been there tonight and caught a round. I certainly hope you can prove that, Sergeant. Easy, Tran. Kowalski. He was a hell of a soldier, sir. Is that what you do? Sponsor an inquisition over here? - Is that what you'll tell the people? - I'll tell what I saw. - That was nothing. - Brutality's not nothing. That man was lining us up for a V. C. Mortar crew. There's still due process. Out here, due process is a bullet. I want you to keep that lighter. It belonged to a medical specialist in Captain Coleman's team. After delivering a Montagnard baby, on his way back to camp a month ago... ...his friends found him about 3 clicks out... ...beheaded, mutilated. His wife couldn't have recognized him. And that V. C. In there did it! That has nothing to do... Tell it to Captain Coleman. And shout it loud... ...because Arlington Cemetery's a long way from here. Next. Now what is it this time? That old ear bothering you? Methiolate. I'm not going to hurt you one bit. Now just hold still. That's it. Don't move. There. Now that's my good girl? Candy. That's for you. Take it. That's it! Next. What is it this time? Want me to take a look? Depressor. Now that's a big boy. You know something? You're all well. Candy. Here, that's for you. Montagnards, sir. The old man's chief of the main village. Great! I'll take her. Right here will do it. The little girl is his granddaughter. She stepped on a pungi stick. He's afraid she's going to die. - How is it? - It's a nasty wound and it's infected. But if we can control it, she'll be all right. Good as new. Pretty tough way... ...to find out about pungi sticks. Sure is. This is the chieftain of the village. Does he speak English? No, sir. - He must trust us. - How's that, sir? Letting Sergeant McGee take care of his granddaughter. - Tell him to come in. - I did, sir. And they won't. Then why did he come to us for help? He says papers fall from the sky. Papers say white man... ...long nose, round eyes, called Americans... ...help Montagnards. But Viet Cong say our papers lie. Pardon me, sir. You like this? She's a woman, right? She said she won't ever take it off. And don't you take this off either. Now you make your old granddad... ...bring you back when this is dirty and I'll put a clean one on for you. That's a good girl! He says the Viet Cong takes all the rice, pigs and chickens... ...and forces all the young men to fight for them. He hates the Cong. Tell him if he'll bring his people in with us... ...that we'll give them protection, money and food. What's he saying? He said, "What's money?" How do you answer that? I think the United States Army can spare a litter. Working on it, sir. He says you're very kind. Tell him if his people are afraid that we'll go out and get them. Captain MacDanial will take a patrol out tomorrow morning and pick them up. He says he'll deal with you alone. He'll come with you and you only. Tomorrow morning at sunrise, or never. That's pretty positive. Sunrise it is. Here's another one. Let's move out. Freeze! You suppose that old chief was wearing more than one face? I don't think so. But we're sure going to respect your hunch. We'll back off to the river again... ...and make a detour. Cut him down. Do you want to hear the story, sir? I know the story, but go ahead. Charlie came at night to take the young men. Most of them listened to the chief and refused to go. They killed the chief. And did this... ...as a reminder to anyone who resisted them. How many of them were there? And where did they go? Safe... ...across the border. What happened to the little girl? What did she say? Five Viet Cong soldiers took her in the jungle. They didn't bring her back. It's no use. I'll do what has to be done. It's pretty hard... ...to talk to anyone about this country until they've... ...come over here and seen it. The last village that I visited... ...they didn't kill the chief. They tied him to a tree... ...brought his teenage daughters out in front of him... ...and disemboweled them. Then 40 of them... ...abused his wife. And then they took a steel rod... ...broke every bone in her body. Somewhere during the process she died. These people need better medical care than we can give them. Where is Colonel Kirby? I'll find him. We've got 3 people who'll make it if we get them to a hospital. Send for my chopper, I can take 3. Coming along? I'm staying. I see them, Dai-uy. Pardon me. Weapons check in 30 minutes! Fall out! Our information checked out. Charlie's building lots of caskets and ladders! How far away? About 15 clicks. That gives us plenty to do before they get here. Restrict all operations to within 4 clicks of the camp. - Systems will be operational by dark? - Affirmative. May I suggest we contact "C" Team? See about the weather. What was all that about ladders and coffins? When Charlie knows he's got... ...a nice box to be buried in, he's just as brave as hell. The ladders? They throw the ladders across the wire to get at us. Later they use them for litters. By later you mean when everybody's dead? Everybody. Women... ...children. Everybody. Come on, Hamchunk. You like? What is there not to like? Who is she? Her name's Lin. Her father was chief of the Hang Pham Province. Until he refused to cooperate with the Viet Cong. - And then they killed him? - They murdered him. And her little brother. In a most hideous way. That's their style. Besides being one of our top models... ...she could be most helpful to our government. Are you trying to tell me something, Colonel? That gentlemen seated with her? He's a double agent. He works for us and for General Pham Son Ti. Then tell me, Colonel... ...who will she be helpful to? Colonel Morgan, there's a big buildup around Camp A-107. It could be the real thing. They request Tac Air and a flare ship. We're working on it. That's fine. Keep us informed. Captain MacDanial had a word for you. - What is it? - Tabasco. I've never known Captain MacDanial to run scared. I'd kind of like to eyeball this situation. Don't you get killed. I don't want my plans for going home to be upset. I'll give you full cooperation. Good night. You didn't get a chance to give him the whole story. I'll arrange another meeting. Kill that light! You better check the gun placements again. I'm going to have a look-see. Over there. A heavy concentration to the south. Let's see what Starlight-Starbright has to say. That's a ruse. Kowalski, MacDanial, pass the word. Quietly. Strengthen the north wall. I repeat... ...strengthen the north wall. Out. Every third man, north wall, quietly. Every third man, north wall. We had better inform the mortar crew. Pit one. Pit two. Pit three. Zero in on the village, four rounds, AG. Fire on order. - What's this? - You know what it is. Stay here. - Alone? - No, you've got your pal. Now, don't get out of there until I tell you. You get down there! You stay quiet! - Been assigned to your position? - No, I haven't. You better come with me. Right front, 200. Get some AG. We'll be dropping it pretty close so make it charge seven. - Level? - Check. Everything copacetic? Ready to fire. Hit the bunker! Fire! - The lieutenant? - He's gone. - I was just talking... - Forget it. Hang! Fire! It's on target. Pit one. You're right on. Give them 3 rounds of WP. We're on target. Three more rounds. Hang! Fire! That's what it's all about, Mr. Beckworth. You going to referee or help us? How? Give the sergeant a hand! I'll take them. Hang! Fire! This is Bulldog. I've got the picture. The Mike Force is right behind me. We'll try and make it in before sunrise. Bulldog, this is Two-Niner Savoy. This is no harassment, sir. It's the real McCoy. They're storming the wire right now. Bulldog, do you read... It's us. Check those generators. That's got to be Bulldog. Bulldog! This is Savoy Six. Over. Hello, Savoy Six, this is Bulldog. The Mike Force is... Savoy Eight, this is Savoy Six. Over. - This is Savoy Eight. - This is Savoy Six. Bulldog's somewhere near you. Can you get to him? Savoy Eight. We saw it. We're on him. Out. Let's go. Damn. Bulldog! Hit the deck! - This man needs attention. - Medic! Machine guns are positioned around LZ green. Get this man down the hill. Charlie's got all landing zones covered. Mike Force is coming behind us. We've got to secure one of them. Why not this one? Let's move out. Bring in the dependents. Here, dog. Fire! Skipper's worried about the inner perimeter. Can you close the breach? That just fits our pistol. We got a little machine that can do that. Let's get them, Seabees! Come on! Take over! Medic! Hit the phoogas! Petersen! Going back to the commo bunker! Yeah. I'll be right with you! He was all you had, wasn't he? You don't have anybody else in the whole world, do you? Except you. Let's get the hell out of here! We can't hold out any longer! We're leaving! Let's go! Pit One! - Pit One, Roger. - Fall back and destroy the tube. Orders to fall back. Let's get the hell out of here! Troop one, we're moving back. Let's go! You heard him, move out! Medic! - Can you walk? - Get me on my feet and I can run! Sir, the Mike Force is all in. Savoy Six, this is Bulldog. Over. This is Savoy Six. Go ahead, Bulldog. Mike Force is on the ground. We're on our way in. We'll try and make it in before the damn sun comes up. Will keep you informed. Move out. Savoy Two-Niner... ...this is Blue Leader. This is Savoy Six, Blue Leader. This is Blue Leader. 2 birds are coming in. Where do you want it dropped? Air strike. Savoy Six, Blue Leader. 400 meters from the north wall... ...southwest to northeast. Do you roger? This is Blue Leader. Roger and out. Savoy Six, this is Bulldog. Go ahead, Bulldog. This is Savoy Six. This is Bulldog. Mike Force is in position. Tell us when you're ready. Roger, Bulldog. Savoy Six. We'll use the air strike to keep Charlie's head down. Execute plan three in two minutes. Do you roger? Roger. Out. Two minutes, pass the word. Fall back, damn it! Fall back to the commo bunker! Everybody! Let go with the phoogas! Let's go! Keep down. Take a platoon down and reinforce Evans. I'm going to the tower. What's the situation? We can't even hold this place with that air strike. Take that 30 end and give support to the 50 caliber. Give me that, I can handle it. Check the team house. Traitor! I'm prepared for that. Medic! Parks, how is he? He's pretty bad, sir, but still alive. See if that 50's operational. I'll check it. Beldo, give me a hand! Fall back! Swing her around 180 degrees. Give them 4 H. E. Maximum elevation... ...and destroy the tube. Fall back! Move them out! Choppers are on their way. Keep your heads down! - What about the radio? - Charges are set and it's ready to go. - Claymores? - We got a few spread out. Move out! Let's go! Keep it down. Let's move. Everybody... ...fall back! Choppers are here. Hurry up! - Everyone out to the LT green. - Fall back! - Hi, Tom. - How you doing, Pete? Take care of that kid, no matter what happens. Will do, Pete. What happened to Nim? He bought the farm, sir, but he took a lot of them with him. Puff the Magic Dragon's on the horn. This is Two-Niner Savoy. Over. Puff to ground, where do you want it? Put it on the camp. Those people have it, we don't. It'll only take a minute. I think Puff broke their back. We can probably move in there tomorrow. God willing, and the river don't rise. What do we do now, sir? First we get some sack time. Then we start all over again. Check the perimeter. Make sure the outposts are set for the night. It couldn't have been much worse, could it? We're still alive. What happens now? We keep doing our jobs. You got one to go back to, haven't you? Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to say in that newspaper of yours? If I say what I feel, I may be out of a job. We'll always give you one. I could do you more good with a typewriter. It's Sergeant Sooby's. He didn't make it. Funny thing. Fellow takes one of these into battle... ...and by the grace of God he comes out in one piece... ...he carries a strange sense of guilt all the rest of his life. I'd like permission to take my men into "A" camp to check equipment. And also, that sergeant who was pretty badly hit was asking for you. Provo? Thank you. Captain Johanson is taking the Mike Force... ...back this afternoon. You can go in with him. - Happy to have had you aboard. - Thanks for the ride, Colonel. Why wasn't he put on the chopper? The wounded go before the dead, sir. We thought it better not to move him. They zapped me good. You're not gone yet. Would you do me a favor, sir? Would you take a touch with me? I sure will. Thank you, sir. Would you do me another favor, sir? What is it? You remember the decision I was trying to make, about my name? The signs? I remember. That's it. There it is, sir. That's what he said he wanted? Affirmative. That's what he wanted and that's what he's going to get! Maybe he liked the idea of having so many men think about him every day. Besides... ...it sings. Sings? Yeah, that's what he said. It sings. Provo's Privy. It does sing! Last time we met, Colonel Cai and I were going to tell you about a plan... ...and "A" camp 107 got hit. This can't wait till you take over. I want you thoroughly briefed. - Why way out here? - This is top secret, Mike. I repeat, top secret. - How was Saigon? - Very interesting. I attended a meeting with the premier and his staff. The main subject was General Pham Son Ti. He has assumed command of the entire Viet Cong forces in the south. Which makes him Number One! Affirmative. And it could mean a major offensive. I had my hands on him the last time I was out here. But I couldn't get enough evidence to hold him against political pressure. Want to get your hands on him again? Who wouldn't? But if I know General Ti, he's surrounded by a regiment. - My people think several. - And that brings us up to the plan. He's somewhere in Hang Phau Valley. Surrounded by the regiments you mentioned, which makes... ...a capture impossible. Precisely. Except for one woman... ...and a certain hand-picked team. Go on, Colonel. This is the rat. And this is the trap. My father was a simple man. All he wanted was to be free... ...his wife to love, and his children to raise. He tried to remain neutral. That was his mistake. What he didn't realize was that... ...man has to pay a price for that freedom. Therefore, he suffered the ultimate penalty. Since that day... ...I've lived but with one thought. To find the man who ordered my father and little brother murdered. I found him. His name is Pham Son Ti. And I will give him to you. When? One week from tonight. At the old Costeau Plantation. Colonel Cai knows where it is. How much do you know about this girl? Her father and General Ti's father grew up together. Their families were very close. Even before he moved to Hanoi... ...he had more than a friendly interest in Lin. Do you trust her? Of course. She's my brother's wife. Let's see, it's 0400 hours. That means we'll hit the drop zone... ...around a little after sunrise. Everything set? Your gear's on board with Colonel Cai's. Thank you. Let's get aboard. You heard the man. Stick formation, let's go. - Keep your head down. - Don't worry. Colonel Cai, you haven't said a word all night. You know why? He's never jumped before. First one's easy. It's the second one that's hard to get them to make. We use the alternative plan Bravo, don't we, sir? Alternative plan Bravo! Kowalski, that means you take the point. If you see anything, don't let them spot you. Freeze! - Let us know. Got it? - Got it. One minute to drop, sir. The recon was a success... ...probably be no trouble. But the word is alert! Get ready. Port side, stand up. Starboard side, stand up. Hook up. Stand in the door. Go! You ready? Sir, Kowalski's got about a 5 minute start on us. Lieutenant Moore sprained his ankle badly. Moore, you'd better stay here with the skylift detail. You come with us, Watson. Move out! Bulldog! Savoy Three. Over. This is Bulldog, Savoy Three. Over! Savoy Three, Savoy Three. This is Bulldog. Over. Trouble. Won't need that anymore. No. But he took them all with him... ...or they wouldn't have left this! Form the burial detail. Yes, sir. There it is. It's your baby. We can never get back here before daybreak. What do you think? - It'll make a nice mess. - How many men will you need? - Doc and two of Colonel Cai's men. - You got them. If we don't get back by 1100 tomorrow... ...you blow it. Head for the rendezvous. - Good luck. - Thank you. Move out. How come you like blowing things up so much? When I was a kid my dad gave me a chemistry set... ...and it got bigger than both of us. The waiting's over. No escort. You all know your jobs. Remember... ...we don't go back without the general. Not one of us. Question? Move out. Wait here. Wine? Later. Come on. There are two guards on the porch. I'm ready for them. - Where's the lady? - Right here. Here. Watch his leg. Get him in there. Nearly finished? What next? Wait. Roadrunner... ...this is Bulldog. Over. Bulldog, this is Roadrunner. Over. How's the traffic? Traffic is scarce this early in the morning. Everything's set. How will you evade? We have spotted motorcycle. We'll be there in seven minutes. Do you read me? Right. Out. We're as ready as we'll ever be. Go ahead, Doc. Here. Take him! Hit it! What the hell? What happened? - I caught one. - The first aid kit! No, not now! Five minutes, this road will be like downtown. Let's get out of here, Sarge. - Get him out of the way. - Release the brake. - Two minutes to lift-off, Colonel. - Move out. You better stay here. Stay there. Colonel, there's the plane. Inflate. Take the rear. Let's get out of here. Sir, could I have a choice? Yeah, you can have a choice. - I'll take the point. - I said you have a choice. Yes, sir, that's why I'm taking the point. We're close to that rendezvous area. You better... ...get out there ahead and see what's waiting for us. Relax. - She's your sister-in-law. - She is. Her whole future, her self-respect... ...everything is in your hands. It isn't that I... Thank you, Mike. You're a brave woman. No, just a woman praying that her family will forgive her. There is nothing to forgive. Thought you'd never get here. Choppers are coming up the valley. Where's Doc? Caught one in the back, but he's going to be all right. Let's get the Colonel. The LZ is a meadow just over that rise. Let's move out! Bastards! Move out. You heard him, let's go! Can you tell me what area's designated as offloading ramp today? Last pad over, next to the water. See that runway over by the beach? That's where your Peter-son's going to be coming in. You take care of yourself. Thank you. - Mister, you Beckworth? - That's right. If you want to go where the war is, this is the way. - Who's that for? - I don't know, boy. Wait until the choppers are down, son. Colonel, I got a jeep for you and Mrs. Cai. Successful mission, Mike. But very costly. Is there a Petersen here? Must be in another chopper, sonny. Not here. Medic! - What happened? - It's Doc, Hamchunk. He's going to be all right. There's none of them left in here, sonny. This is one job I don't envy you, Colonel. You always knew it could happen, didn't you? But I didn't want it to. None of us did. Was my Peter-son brave? He was very brave. Are you going to be? I'll try. I know you will. And I'm sure that... ...your Peter-son... ...would want you to have that. What will happen to me now? You let me worry about that, Green Beret. You're what this is all about. Back at home, a young wife waits Her Green Beret has met his fate He has died for those oppressed Leaving her this last request Put silver wings on my son's chest Make him one of America's best He'll be the man they'll pick one day Have him wear the Green Beret
