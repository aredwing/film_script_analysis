Your passenger is carrying two million dollars in stolen, uncut diamonds. True? Go ahead, ask him. "no questions asked." Now, I will count backwards from ten, and then you will slow your vehicle... Is it true? ... and we will escort you to the side of the road. Don't do it! Don't, please! Nod your head if you understand me. I'm not getting killed for your merchandise. Listen to me. We're gonna give them what they want. Ten... You don't go through customs with two million in diamonds... Nine... in your suitcase! Eight... I swallowed them. Seven... The diamonds are inside of me. Six... They will cut me wide open! Five... Please. Four... Don't stop. Three... If you stop, you might as well kill me yourself! Two... one. Please. Slow down. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Slow down now. Buckle up. Ahh! Are you still alive? Yeah. What, are you crazy? What are you doing? Ah! thump! thump! thump! What are you doing? Shh. Oh, my God. We'll call it in to Highway Patrol from the next town. It's more than they would've done for us. Thank you. Tell me, what you said about having swallowed the diamonds... was it true?
