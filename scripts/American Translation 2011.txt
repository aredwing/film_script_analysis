I don't get hard when I drink too much. You wouldn't want something floppy? Here... Strip off slowly for me. Touch the tip of your nipples, I like that. And you? What me? - What are you doing? - Getting a hard-on. That's already something. Don't talk so much. Whatever. What should I do? Touch the tip of your nipples. He doesn't know it yet, but he's history. That's not gonna be easy. Oh, the French... and their good social consciousness. I call it hypocrisy. His time is over. He's fired. - He's a big fish. - That's it! It's time again! Today, we cut of the heads. People don't like when we sympathize with the victim. Why're you telling me this? Because we consider that you could take his place. Funny idea, you without a head. Heard that? The brilliant sense of humour of the Y generation. And your son, how's he doing? I'll have to think about it. I'm not sure I can accept. I think, you have no choice. We'll talk about it soon. I'm flying to LA tomorrow morning. Have a nice flight. You know what the Y generation's interested in right now? Why am I here? You're in Paris, and I've decided that you should meet with Pierre. Sweetheart, would you mind If I cancel our dinner tonight? You still believe we can have dinner? Stop playing so cool! You must be born again. - Otherwise, it won't work. - Dad, we've talked about it already. Let me remind you, young lady, I'm convinced your mother would accept you... - I must pee. My name is Chris... Christophe. I'm Aurore. You're impulsive... just like me. Not always. Who's the guy with you? My dad. - Why doesn't he speak French? - He's American. You're American... I knew it. I'm both, my mom is French. You wanna stay together? Yeah. Why not? I'll wait outside. Why so long? - You feel bad? - No, I'm great. - I've gotta go. - Already? - We'll have no time together? - To bond? Whatever. Don't forget, my darling. Without money, there's a lot of things you couldn't afford. I know. I'm parked out back. Where're we going? Your place? This is my place. No, I'm not coming home tonight. No, don't worry. Ok. Ok, don't make a scene. Have a good trip. These little roads are great. My mom left when I was 11. She was a wanderer too. Dad wanted a clean break. He gave her cash. Not a lot, because he was a plumber. It pays ok, though. She liked cash more than she liked me. He croaked a year ago. Cancer. I didn't like my dad. Feeling programmed like a robot. I can't stand it. It's hard to rebel, when you have everything. Money, health... supposedly perfect parents. Guys? - Yeah. - A lot? - Not many. - How many? Three. All the way, that is. I'm the fourth? My lucky number is four. I swear. - You ever have an abortion? - No. Anything else about guys? I nearly got engaged to the last one, Scott. What's the nickname for Scott? Scotty. I don't like the guy. Did you love him? No. He was like a stereotype, Mr Perfect. Big smile, firm handshake, ambitious. My parents loved him. A good match. What bullshit. I want to be inside you, now. You like it? My dad bought it 5 years ago, but we only come once a year. We could redecorate together? If you want me to feel at home, absolutely. - You have a cleaning lady? - No, not yet. Who waters the plants? They're fake. I don't like fake plants. Throw them out. I'm going to hire a cleaning lady. You like to cook? It's better I don't. No big deal. We'll do Dial-A-Pizza, Dial-A-Chinese, Dial-A-Couscous. Yes, that's fine. You'll be happy, I met someone. A French, yes. No. Stop it with all the questions! I don't like that conversation, Oliver. I'm much better and that's all that counts. Call me back when you've calmed down. I don't like cellphones. I don't like you talking to other guys. Who's this Oliver? Oliver's my best friend. And he's gay, if that makes you feel better. It doesn't. Really? Speak American to me. What do you want me to say? I love you. I'm afraid. Go on. I love your strong shoulders. and your smile... so juvenile. You understand? No. I don't believe you don't speak a word English. I can tell you a secret then. I never believed in love at first sight. I hope you're saying nice things to me? You know what are those who listen to rock without understanding the lyrics? They are morons! I've made out good since dad died. I'm a wanderer, that's my job. For money, I play poker. I'm lucky. Little here and there. I don't have many expenses. I love driving... I leave Paris, I drive. Like we're doing now. I live little road movies. "Road trips", you mean "road trips". You're chatty this morning. No, I'm just telling you. You don't ask questions. I like that about you. You never ask any questions. So that's perfect. It's because you know me. I felt that when we met. You know me. We understand each other perfectly. Excuse me. I'm looking for Lauzin Street. No idea, I'm new around here. Without a GPS, it's hard to find your way around. Buy a map. Alright now get lost. - We're only talking. - Beat it. You deaf? You wanna fight? Chris, let it go. That's a first, someone wanting to fight for me. You like it? Yeah. There's internet in the apartment. I know. But I have my habits. See you next Thursday. Yeah, see you Thursday. How much did you give her? Her work is worth it. - It's not the rate. - Fuck the rules. Who should decide the price of work? Paying our cleaning lady executive rates is my business. I need some fresh air. - You know him? - No. - He looks like a prostitute. - That's exactly what he is. - He looks young. - He's 8. That's what they all say. Wait here. This is Steve, Steven. We're having lunch. - What do you usually eat? - Junk, muesli bars. Healthy food is good for you. Let's go for a walk in the woods. - You sure? - I'll pay you for the time. OK cool. Your generosity again? We're engaged, we're getting married soon. This is one of my favorite spots. There's never a soul on weekdays. I want to give Steve a cuddle. You're the one who counts, baby. With you, I never cheat. I don't like him. I don't like him either. What the hell happened? What the hell happened, Chris? Did you fight? He wanted me to choke him... you know, while... I didn't judge it right. It was an accident, huh? Right, it was an accident? Wanna get out of here? To go where? Where I come from. Where I was born. In the North, near Lille. Why not, yeah. I love you so much, baby. It wasn't an accident, right? Don't talk about that. Don't mention it again. Something deep connects us. That's the only thing that matters. Christopher! What do you want now? You always show up with no warning. Aurore, the love of my life. We'd like you to marry us. A symbolic act. What's the hesitation? You can't refuse me anything. Christophe, do you take Aurore for your wife, and promise to remain faithful to her, in happiness and in hard times, in sickness and in health, and love her all the days of your life? I do. Aurore, do you take Christopher as your husband, and promise to remain faithful to him in happiness and in hard times, in sickness and in health, and love him all the days of your life? I do. He gave me pocket money in my teens. We had a lot of fun together. I feel sorry for that priest. We're empty. - You didn't see the sign? - No. I can't read anyway. And your girlfriend can't read? She's my wife, and she's not French. - What's your name? - Alexandre. No, thanks. If the boss sees me smoke... - Your boss is an asshole? - He's a boss. I'm still on trial. To get work round here, you really gotta toe the line. You like cars? Yeah but now we only get old wrecks to fix. Like the boss says, we're not magicians. People don't have money to buy new cars. You should see the clunkers they bring in. What do you do after work? - Not much. - You have a girlfriend? This is Alex, he's a good guy. We were just chatting. You'll find gas in Armentires. We'll stay at Vert Mont Inn for 2-3 days. Come see us. Sure why not. He can't read? Is that true? - Hello, Mrs Levant. - You've come back? - I wanted to show my wife around. - You're married? We're staying 2-3 days, do you have a room? He won't be pleased to see you, but... we have few clients now. But you pay in advance. Sure, no problem. He never got over it. She's talking about her husband. Their son died. He was my best friend. Benoit. Ben. We were always hanging out. Going out drinking all night. Then one evening, in his pad, he started howling like crazy, completely drunk... saying that he wanted to die, that the world was a shit hole, he didn't want to be part of it... The more he talked... the more I laughed, listening to him. But he wasn't laughing. He seemed so convinced. I didn't even try to comfort him or contradict him. Nothing. I left him alone. Next day... his father found him in his room, checked out. Alcohol overdose, some shit like that. We mixed everything in our drinks to get really fucked up. You make me become somebody else. I feel a rage inside. I'm back into the blood. I love you. I speak American too. When I walk like this going nowhere, crazy ideas go through my head. You wanna know? Sure. I'm like a fish, no one hears me cry. Everything good is wild and free. I'd like to be a cowboy. I didn't kill Ben. I don't want a life of quiet despair! Me too! You know what makes our love dangerous? No. That it ends. You did it. You led him astray. Without you, he'd still be here. You killed him, feeding him sick ideas. I need some fresh air. You know that old ad? I saw it in a best-of. Come in. You're alone? Where's Chris? I don't know. You know he likes to cruise around. He'll be back soon. - You married for long? - No. He's cool. You have a girlfriend? I had one, but she was too boring. Hours listening to her talk, People magazine crap... just to kiss for 3 minutes. No tongues, she was always disgusted. Bad choice. My brother Simon, he's the opposite. His girl got pregnant, what a fuckup. - What does he do? - He's unemployed. Hi, Chris. I didn't think you'd come bug us. You should be with people your age. Alex... Alex! You better go. I need your help, baby. A little further to go, baby. Tell me. Stop, Chris. I'll never leave you, baby. We're a team. - What should I talk about? - Will you stop fucking with me. You're angry? Why do you do it? Before you, no one gave me a chance. That's why I show you who I am. How should I take it? Is it a challenge? As a kid... my dad made me go to church, and I believed in God. Then I stopped believing. I don't believe in good or evil any more. Today, there are the hungry ones and those who have fear. I have a terrible fear inside me. You have that fear too, baby. I recognized it. I didn't want to be paralyzed by the fear growing inside me. So I followed my impulses. Girls, boys. With the girls, I never paid. But with boys... money makes things easier. Especially with the young ones. I know where they hang out. Prostitutes or not. My age freaks them out. They trust me. They talk to me. They're flattered I listen to them. Nothing. I screwed up first year in tech college. - In what? - Computers. My parents couldn't pay a private school. - Why? My dad works in a factory. Only part-time. My mom is a guidance counsellor. That's funny. Why? Because I have no guidance. I like their passivity. Sometimes so unexpected. At the beginning, it was just sex. Then one day... with some girl, I forget her name, I felt something bizarre. What time is the movie? Look in the paper. You could have shaved first, I have a bad rash now. Your ass was on fire and I fucked you right, so keep your bullshit remarks to yourself. Ok, let's change the vibe? I thought you were into I was saying that for next time. There won't be a next time, you piss me off. Waitresses like you, wagging their asses, I bang 7 a week. I don't wag my ass for everyone. I really dug you. Relax. I am relaxed. So relaxed, I'm gonna skip the movie. Have a quiet evening alone. Yeah? You're a misleading kind of guy. The more I looked at her... how can I put it... the more I got a hard-on. But in my head. I never hit a girl again. Believe me. You're right, baby. It does me good to talk to you. - And this girl you... - No. I prefer you don't ask questions. Let me go on. The next day I saw Vlad, one of my regulars. Did you know in the US a lot of young Mormons become prostitutes? Pass me the joint instead of talking bullshit. The older men eject the teenage boys from the community so they can have access to many women. They're polygamous. - Yeah? - And you know what? They send teenage boys to be prostitutes in Florida. Apparently it's a whole network. Minors bring in a lot of money. I should have gone and worked out there illegally, the money's better. You're not a minor. I'm sure Americans fantasize more about Russians than the French do. Because of the Cold War. The ones who are over 50 years old. - You're not Russian, you're Rumanian. - We're all the same to them. Do you mind if I punch you? I asked you a question, Vlad. If you give me more money, fine. And don't leave too many marks, ok? That really gave me the hard-on. I paid him 200 euros. Since that day, I understood my soul could become a foreign territory. And I got back on the road, following these new impulses. I'm so happy we're together. That's it. I've told you everything, baby. Do you love me like this? As I am? I'm going to help you. You'll see. Here we are. Are you asleep? No. I'm starving. Want some Chinese? Yeah. - Can I order for you, baby? - Yeah. Come in. Where were you born? Here, in France. But my dad's from Cambodia. - Boat people? - Yeah. He met my mum in a refugee center. She was an aid worker there. Looked after the clothes. - So you're mixed race. - Yeah. Mom's not French, she's Portuguese. You don't look like you got any Portuguese. It's good to be a mix, that's the future. Mixed races are the angels of a world free of purity. Stop fooling around, Chris, the food's getting cold. not bad huh? What are you doing? Nothing, I can't sleep. Yeah, I know him, the guy from Philadelphia. He was an expert in his line. What bullshit. The shrinks have no idea. I'm just getting information. It could help. Help with what? What counts is that you understand me. I don't give a fuck about the others. Right. Go on then. Ask me some questions. Ok, I'm willing to take the test. - Did you ever start a fire? - No. - Did you torture animals as a kid? - No. I did it once, with girlfriends. We put a cigarette in the mouth of a big toad, and it exploded. That's not torture. Torture is when you take your nasty neighbor's cat, you suffocate it in a bag, wait til he's nearly passed out, take a pair of scissors, poke - his eye out, then... - Did you piss in bed as a kid? Hell no! My dad wouldn't have put up with it. The belting I would have got. Did your dad beat you? Did he hit you often? What do they know? All that psychology shit... Just because you're beaten, that explains everything? My dad always told me, I'm a child of God. Understand? I'm a child of God, whatever I do. You're right, Chris. We're all children of God. If you really want to understand me... there's only one way. Shit, it's not him. - Vlad's not here? - No, he left. - Where to? - Went to the US. I took over his spot. I'm with my wife, is that ok? It's ok, I just won't tell my girlfriend. Guys, it's not a problem, but chicks, yeah... No point trying to understand. - What's your girl's name? - Marie. - And you? - Nicolas. Aurore, Nicolas. Nick. Let's go to the country, we like fucking in nature. Can I answer? It's my girlfriend, I just sent her a text message. Yeah, answer. Yeah, you ok? Yeah, 5 minutes max. Yeah, the work is good this afternoon. I can't talk now. OK, talk to you later. Kiss you. To die while still innocent. That's what I give them. I free them. With this act, I extinguish our revolts. Chris, the knife! What a bastard, little shit! Do you understand me better now? We share our life for better and for worse. Repeat it for me in American. Repeat after me! We share our lives for better or for worse. This makes us stronger, you'll see. Good afternoon, Officer. Your papers, please. You're not answering? Put it on voicemail. We're busy. Take it easy, baby. Could you show me what you have in the back? We're taking a trip, we're newly-weds. We're into that. - Just anywhere? - Places where there's nobody. It's our honeymoon trip. OK, Thomas, all in order. Wow, Tom, you're pretty built! Yeah, I'm in the regional gym team. - Married? - No. Gym takes all my time, with competitions... Give me that phone. With that we can be traced. If you don't change, I can't continue. You're an addict. Get addicted to our love. What can I do for you? Nothing. I've got my period. It's always like this the first day. Tomorrow, it'll be better. You're going to stay there as if you had your period too? Don't be mad, baby. You'll get over it. Hey, what about a tip? If you blow me, I'll give you a big one. You're lucky I need the job, otherwise I'd smash your face. Go on, if you've got any balls. You must be crazy to live with this guy. Go on, get out. I tired myself out. Couldn't sleep. You feel better? No, not really. Hello. No, she's here, it's not a wrong number. My name is Chris. I'll put her on. It's your father. This is my boyfriend, I'll tell you later. Yes, that's fine. It's going great. Why? No, not at all. It is there, but it's fine. Yes, he lives there. This is a problem? Yes, I think it's serious. You'll be okay when you meet him. Hi, Dad. Kiss mom for me. What's wrong? My dad's showing up next week, problems with his business. - You think he'll like me? - I don't care. We'll see when he's here. Fucking economic crisis... Need to take your mind off things, huh. There's something I'd like to try. What? Laundromats make for good hunting. You just have to be patient. What's the big deal. I'm naked at home. - And you've already acted? - No, not yet. I did some castings, but... It's fantasy island those jobs. Actor, singer... I'm giving myself 5 years to make it. - How old are you? - 2. You look older. And what do you do? No kidding. I manage to do nothing. - And I do nothing. - Yeah, ok. Yeah but my parents, they have quite a lot of money. I came to Paris to find myself. Then I met Chris. Right, here we are. Living from day to day. Today, that's the winning strategy. Whether you're in the shit or not. Me, I'm always ahead of the game. I've always lived like that. Yeah right... Well, time to go to work. What time do you start? I'm going to take a shower. - Did you like it? - Yeah, great. You? If it's good for you, it's good for me. He's well hung, huh! He said he was finished at 2? What's his problem? - Why don't we go. - We're staying. We'll see him some other time. I want to see him today. Maybe he finished earlier. We don't even know where he lives. I don't like to be fucked with. - Together forever, then? - Yeah, that's right, get in. - Where do you live? - Not far, just past Bastille. Beat it, I don't want to see you again. What do you mean? I said get lost. Are you sick, man? - What's the matter? - Drop it. Move it. What's wrong with you? I've thought about it. I want you all for me, baby. I would have killed him. I could feel it growing inside me. I'm so proud I didn't. There's someone in the bathroom. Shit, it's my father. WMake some coffee. Hi, Dad! Where 's my bathrobe? Where have you put the bathrobe? At least we just cleaned it. I hung it by the door! I'd to come back right away. I'm very busy. Things take more than they did before. And... Remember Pierre? He sucked us in some terrible shit. I can't find a replacement. I'd like you to meet Chris. - We spoke on the phone. How long do you intend keep this guy? If he's all you found in Paris, you'd better go home. Are you crazy to talk like that? - What's wrong? - Nothing. I wanted to go with Chris to Los Angeles. Spend some time with him there. It might seem crazy, but America's my dream. I've always imagined myself there. As a cow-boy, wild and free, or as a hippy in California. Or even a dealer on Wall Street. I want you to know, it's serious between me and Chris. You want my opinion? No. I don't like your tone. I'm nice with you, and you look down on me. What's your problem? I don't care if you don't like me. Aurore is the love of my life. Too bad if it pisses you off. People like you, I like pissing off. So we're going to the US, your house or somewhere else. Come on, calm down. Do have to play this game again? It is fine, and you ruin everything in 5 minutes! You better leave. - Go to the hotel or ... - You go both! He has no home. He's not daddy's son as you are. Talk to me! You're right. I better go. - I need some fresh air. - Me too. Why are you coming to the United States? - What are you asking? - Make an effort. These are the questions the Immigration Officer will ask. So I'm asking: Why are you coming to the United States? Because it's my dream. All my heroes are American. They don't give a fuck about that. You say you're on vacation, visiting friends. I'm on vacation ... I'm on vacation. visiting some friends. Go on. Why are you coming to the United States? - Is Christopher Sarge here? - Yes, that's me. Inspector Malherbe. - What's going on? - We have a warrant for your arrest. What does that mean? You have to come with us for questioning. What's the charge? You're a suspect in the murder of Nicolas Barnier. A prostitute found dead in the woods near Rambouillet. - Nonsense. - The police stopped you in the area. Your van was identified. We traced it here. You're the girl who was with him? Yes. You'll have to come with us too. I love you Chris. Don't be scared. I'm scared. Hold me. Please, let her kiss me. It's ended? Think of our love, my love. This is your apartment? Yes, it's my father's. Cover my ears with your hands, please. Cover my ears. This story was based on studies of serial killers and their testimonies. In one of the stories stands: Serial killers share an extraordinary paradox: They suffer enormously and express that pain in their violent acts. To kill satisfies their deep need to exist." Another killer said: "When I kill, I get rid of my humanity like a heavy burden. I'm in a wonderful world of indifference, there where no distress, no solitude can menace me any longer."
