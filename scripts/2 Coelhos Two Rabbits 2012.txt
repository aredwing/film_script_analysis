Create a blog... that I'd sell a year later for a million dollars. To adopt a stray dog, paint a picture, learn Spanish... Yo no hablo espanhol pero me encanta Rio. To invest in the stock market... Start a campaign against land mines... and cluster bombs. Write a book... A book? No. A movie script? Start a revolution, be a Che! Or maybe not... while in doubt, I enjoy my favorite pastimes... ...pornography... ...and video games. Or, if you prefer, videogames and pornography. "KICKING ASS IN MIAMI BEACH" I have just come back from a short time abroad. I spent two years there. It was fun. But it was time to come back. And now that I'm back... I've just found a purpose... ...a path... ...mission to accomplish. It's Edgar. Hey, What's up? A long time ago, in a galaxy far away... ...I had a bright future. I always had a connection to electronic stuff. It started with remote controls... Atari, Odyssey, Master System, then MSX, 286, 386. I was the family genius, a big nerd. When I was in college... while my friends were drowning in booze and women... I practiced things that were absolutely useless. Then, my first job. Say... What are you doing this weekend? Well... ... let's just say that. I felt a certain incompatibility with the corporate world. Good morning. So, is everything ready? Wait a minute. Fuck me! You call this shit a layout? And a certain difficulty to cope with critics. My boss. "Me". People called him the bomb-man! He is an evil visionary! He asked me to tie him up and slap him also... I like his insanity a little bit. Asshole! Douche! He's an antichrist! Liar! A loser, loser. Totally a loser! They even said he was a faggot, I don't know. I'm out of it... A guy like that has no plan for his life? I do have a plan. A fucked up plan, to be honest, but it is a plan. - What's up? - How are you, kid? You're back? Yeah, I guess. So, Ching-Ling brought my stuff? Let's go there. Ching, you've got a customer. How are you? Your toy! Open it. I'm curious to see. Look at this beauty. I'll tell you. - Hold this. - Okay. Now, walk that way. Go ahead. Right there, it's ok! Now, come slowly... What is this, man? This one... ...when it gets near to this one... It discharges an electric current, a proximity sensor. And what are you doing with it? What I'm going to do? My idea is quite simple: justice. To kill two rabbits with just one blow. "TWO RABBITS" This plan has been dancing in my mind for quite a while-. It was before I went to Miami. But I perfected it there. I just need some sort of a click, to find that last piece of the puzzle and see the whole picture. Hey, you! Punk! You moron! Retarded! Nice to meet you. My name is Edgar. Wake up, man! Give me your watch. Hurry up, you ass! You want to die? Want to be shot at? In the head? That's it. Where's the money? I said money! You call this money? Give me your money, come one! What is that thing over there? - My cell phone. - Give me that. - What else do you have? What else? - Nothing. Nothing? Have a nice day, pal. Shit! I was mugged! What if he'd get a shot off? It could've been fun. What could I have done for him to shoot me? What if I did this? Or this? Oh! FON FON, the teddy bear. You fucking vagabonds! Hey, D'Artagnan. Wake up. Come eat something. Man, drop that fucking magazine and come eat something. I'm coming, bro. - Come on! - Just a second, man. - Mrs. Te. I'm here. - Come on in. I've brought food for the guys. It's all there. At least the food, I'm starving. You don't work And you want to eat? Maicon called. He said it's all good. Business is up. - So? - Uncle Maicon's words: close shop. - Close shop? - God knows what he means. This is Bola, aka Carioca. He's Maicon's right hand man. Who's Maicon? I'll tell you later. The right question now is: what are these guys doing... looking at the Persian carpet in their living room? Take the carpet up. Come on, hurry. Take her, guys. This is Miss Puhn. P + U + H + N But, why is Miss Puhn buried alive in this fetid hole? It was because of her mother Mrs. Calia, or Mrs. Puhn. P + U + H + N Bling, Bling! Bling, bling! The Geush Brothers! Mrs. Celia is a trusted employee of the Geush Twins... who got rich with a cheap TV auction show. Mrs. Celia is particularly close to Sasha... The oldest and the gayest of them. So, it happens that Sasha besides trusting Miss. Celia her love affair secrets, trusted also the company's vault secret. And it was exactly that secret that ended up placing Miss. Celia and her daughter in that, let's say, difficult situation. Now you have your money, where's my daughter? Where's my daughter? Easy, easy! Give me the glasses! Fucking coward. You've shit your pants. Fuck! Answer the fucking door! Everybody quiet! Hands on your heads, come on! Easy, man! There's a child here. Shut the fuck up! What's this? Where's Maicon in all this shit? Wait, wait, it's not the time to reveal who Maicon is. Later... DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I need 144, please. I think it's December if I'm not mistaken. Thank you. Julia? - How are you? - Hi, Rodrigues. - I'm fine. You? - Where did you have lunch? In that new Indian restaurant down the street. Is the Indian good? - It's okay. - I know, very spicy stuff. - Shoot, say it. - I'm going to have to transfer you. Internal affairs. They're pressing for an administrative investigation. It's come from the top. But why? They've found evidence against the Maicon guy's gang. We've been after him for 3 years. Now things will be tough for him. We've linked him to the jewelry robbery, the Jew's case... At least eight homicides, armed robbery, kidnapping and more. That's okay by me. If they want it like that, it's their call. Nobody doubts your honesty... but many people are annoyed by this whole story. Who else will be transferred with me? I don't know yet. But I'll keep you posted. Okay. Hi, hi, it's me. Things got ugly here. Yeah, come here, now. No, come here, now. I'm not waiting. We must see him, alright? Okay, we. Julia thinks she's dying, but she isn't. She's just having a panic attack. Julia loves the sea... She loves the sun... a man's hand... the wind birds... Julia? My car is here. You're singing that song again. Come on, let's go! This song soothes me! - You want to take a pill or something? - No, I don't. I want to get over this by myself. I need to learn how to control these crazy thoughts. I can do it. Julia and Henrique make a perfect couple. She is a prosecutor, he is a criminal's lawyer. At least in crockery things seemed to be going well. Julia has exclusive information... that only people inside the Prosecutors Office have access to. With this information, our friend Henrique... orients his clients, creates alibis, and prepares his bullet-proof cases. Come on, Henrique! That's okay. What's up Henrique! How's it going? - Well, and you? - Cool, man, I need to talk for a second. Go ahead I'll be right there. But where are these two going now? They've come to see their biggest and only client... ...Maicon. So who is this Maicon, anyway? Where's Maicon in all this shit? I'm here, boss... Here I am! - Are you all right, my friend? - Yes. Did you do it alright? Did you wash your hands? Your zipper is open. You don't need anything else? You want a kiss from Bola? Let's come back. At first sight, Maicon is a nice criminal. But who said there are nice criminals? So, anyone else want to go to the bathroom? Now, the pressing question here is... who are you again? This is Roberto, also known as Tanajura. He is a policeman who works as security for the Geush Brothers. Roberio planned the whole robbery at the Geush company. Then he decided to hire Maicon's gang to do the job. So you're Tanajura. You fucking Bozo! Nice to meet you. We haven't had the chance to meet in person. - You know why we're here. - No, I have no idea. Well, my friend... I delivered it on a tray for you... to get the Chinese woman and her daughter. - So, where's the money? - There's no money. There's something else... she's not Chinese, she's Japanese. No, Maicon, she's Korean. Shut up! What? She's Korean. She's not Japanese or Chinese. - Let's get it right... - Shut up! - So, she's Korean. - I don't fucking care! Fuck, I've come all this way to this shithole just to settle this shit down! To settle it up. Well, brother, you must know that everybody is onto us... the police know... So relax. Relax. Get the man a beer. Stop fucking around! If you've fucked this up and whacked the Chinese girl... that's your problem, fuck it! I took the risk, so now I'm leaving without the money, you know? You do that. Or else I won't answer for myself! - You have the money, right? - Right. So, where's our share? I like that, Tanajura's not fucking around. Hey, guys, learn with him. He came here to solve his problem, right? But you came at this hour? - You want to solve this right now? - What? You have working hours now? From eight to six? Boss, let's make a deal... Fuck your deal! Fuck your deal! I'm not a fool, Look, I know you... I know you wanted to stab me in the back, you fucking rat! - So, you've heard? - Where's it, you son of a bitch? If there's one thing Maicon respects, it's his mother. And, my friend, if there's one thing that makes him crazy... that's when someone calls him son of a... What did Maicon do? Well, we'd better back off to get the whole picture. Fry the fish, Bola! Fuck, man! You jumped all over me! In the cat's mouth, boss! Maicon had it all planned. I'll watch the game somewhere else. He framed Roberio. The dude shit himself. He broke the saint's head, man! - Okay, twelve years. - Right. You're a cheat! All of a sudden a magic envelope appeared in the Prosecutor's Office. OPEN I URGENT Photographs, phone calls, documents. They delivered a busload of evidence on a tray, connecting Maicon to Geusch's theft, Puhn's death, and the police officer Roberto's murder. This takes us back to the meeting with Julia, Maicon and Henrique. I was just trying to explain to Maicon... that the Prosecutors Office Will come for him very hard. - He got that, right? - Right. And now I want a suggestion from you. What do I do? In fact, Maicon, we have lost the initiative. The evidence is incontestable, they will beat you up. So now I'm fucked. I want some alternative. You are right. You must have alternatives. My hands are tied there! They're onto me, I might get busted. We've got to find another way to get information and plan everything. It can't be with me. Look, they'll have a warrant for year arrest by next week. You must hurry, they might even get it this week. Really? And what the fuck should I do? Should I lay low, maybe run away? No, running away is just like pleading guilty. Julia knows a person who might help you. Yeah, I know someone. It might work, or it might not. The man is a state deputy. He has contacts in the police, in the judiciary and shit. - Will he come over to the dark side? - He's already on the dark side, baby. The man loves money. He has helped a lot of people. Remember that whole bingo halls scheme? - Well, this is the man. - If it weren't for him there... wouldn't be a single bingo hall open. But now they're all closed down. Okay, they were open for ten years. Well, we must be quick. So, give me a figure... how much are you willing to put on the table? I don't know, I've got no funds now. Listen to me. I'm your lawyer! I told you not to open this goddamn parking lot. This is an investment, man! I'm renting the upper floor to a church. Wait, wait. Listen to me. We'll try to get a politician's help, okay? I would say Julia has a talent for influencing men. - Dad. - Hi, son. - How are you? - I'm fine, thanks. - The restaurant is beautiful. - Do you like it? But how much are you paying that girl... to scare the clients away? - The receptionist? - The deceptionist. - So how are things going? - Fine. With you? - I was robbed. - What? Robbed? - Did they do anything to you? - No, no. - Are you alright? - Sure. What did they take? They took my watch, my iPhone and 15 bucks. It's the end of the world. What about Walter? What about him? Look, son, it's okay. I've talked to him. I told him you were back. There's no problem. I think he understood. I'm sure he has forgiven you. He's calmer. I think you should sit down and talk. - Yeah, it's a good idea. - You do that. If he accepts you apologies, great. If he doesn't, that's his problem. The most important thing is us, the family. That's right, Dad. - We've helped him enough, right? - True. Alright, I think I'm going. What do you mean, you're going? You're going nowhere. - I'm going to have a dog... - No, you'll have lunch with me. - You're eating food. - I miss the hot-dogs up there. Hot-dogs? Don't you miss your father? How long were you away? Come on! You're having lunch with me. I've got something special for you. Minced meat special. How about that? - I hate that. - I'm just kidding. Afonso? Prepare that dish I told you. That's right. Steak and French fries? - That's right. - Correct? This is Walter. He's a college professor. But what is a college professor doing... working as the cashier at my father's restaurant? Well, it's quite complicated, but... right now I would like to focus on a man... who's equally important to my plan. This is Jader Kerteis, the state deputy... that Julia and Henrique suggested to Maicon. Mr. Jader, ten years ago, a politician full of good intentions. No no, this is not Jader, this is Zacharia's double and, ins his party's political broadcast... he appeared right after a Zacharia's impersonator... who was so bizarre that got people's attention. Jader slipstreamed it and was elected. So was Zhacharias, by the way. Jade is dignity, Jader is respect... Jader is honesty. Jader, 888886. With Bem Te vi, 88. After he was elected... within a few months he got a taste of reality. When he noticed, he was involved in schemes... to approve skyscraper construction in restricted areas... to favor companies in the bidding to supply school meals... and so on. The other day... I saw the government's Party political broadcast... And this is what was said, the TV host speaking solemnly... When the disease came, we treated it the best way we could. They can't be serious! This is such cheap advertising! This is an advertising text that says... The health care, we offer the people... Is really rubbish! Not to say crap. Now moving on to another issue... Hello I'm home. More or less. No, not yet. This is Sofia, Jader's wife. I'm putting it on now. Okay? Me too, bye! And she's not so happy with Jader. - Jader? - Just a second. - What, Sofia? - Your jacket. I'm not wearing a jacket. Say it, what time? And now, while he east his medium rare steak... accompanied by an elegant gratin galettes... he's about to receive a phone call that will change his life. - Yeah? - Jader? - Hi, this is Henrique. - Hi, Dr. Henrique. My assistant told me about your case. Some more water, please. Thank you. So, man, due to his history this is a complicated deal. I know, that's why my client needs your expertise... Your influence. But, my friend this caliber is too high. I'll have to think about it, see what I can do to help. Listen, deputy, I want you to know in advance... that both my client and my group... we are ready to pay a small urgency fee... I know, everybody has urgency... Besides, we have the election next year, I'll be very busy. I have to think about it. We'll see. But this is not the right place to discuss this. - Tell me, do you enjoy jogging? - Jogging? I do, I do. The probability theory tries to quantify the notion of mathematically probable. - What's up, man? - Hey, how are you? - A hot-dog with two sausages. - You got it. But I guess not even such complex formulas... would be able to quantify the probability... of my meeting the asshole who robbed me 24 hours later... right at my favorite hot-dog stand. Things are good here, huh? - Hello. - How are you? I want the usual, with... Fon Fon the Teddy Bear. With mash and fries. Good afternoon, Agent Maircio, please. - Edgar? - Edgar. Hi. We got the man. Come take a look. He went to eat the wrong hot-dog at the wrong place. I bet that gave him indigestion. Take a look. See if it's him. Velinha woks really hard. He's a delivery guy for several food places... all of them with fancy Italian names... Pizza Molto, Watashi Watakaro, Il Pazzo Capperi. Ilshawarma Dihere and son on. In fact, he's the owner of all these pizza places... because none of them really exists. They are all a facade for his scheme. No, this guy has a Fon Fon teddy bear tattoo... - No, he is not the guy... - Fon Fon teddy bear? The guy who robbed me had a Panda bear tattoo. - He's not the guy. - Are you sure? Take a good look. This guy is a friend of a delivery boy who works for my father. - He's a working guy. - A friend? DEAD END STREE - Your down, punk! - Easy... Here, here If you try anything, I'll kill you. Easy, easy. I just need to talk to you. - Who are you? - I just need to talk to you. - I just want to talk, man. - What are you up to? - You like following muggers around? - Fuck! - Is this your kinky fantasy? - I saved your ass today! - You didn't save shit! - I'm just want to make an offer... Are you high, man? Why are you laughing? - I have a proposal. - A proposal? Loads of cash. It's a good deal. Get up, get up. Get up. Talk. Want to spend the rest of your life delivering pizza... stealing cell phones at traffic lights? A tough guy? Are you a tough guy? You followed me here to laugh at me? Is that it? You've got one minute to convince me. Come on. There's a bag full of cash. I know where it's going. I know the time and the place. - Whose money is that? - Car smugglers'... Mercedes, Lamborghinis, you know? Rich people's cars? You like cars, right? The guy likes them too. Tell me more. I'll tell you the time and place, we go there and split it. Split what? What are we splitting? This hurts, man... What? Am I laughing? Do I think it's funny? Am I laughing, asshole? - Man, it's a lot of cash. - How much? - Two million. - Two million Reais? Dollars. No, man, that's too much! He's chicken thief, Jader! Don't talk shit. I know how much they stole from the Jews. Two millions dollars? Fuck, that's some serious dough! I'm telling you, It's the real deal. You're fucking with me. - That's too much money. - I'm serious. I only want half. One million's yours. You bet. Let's talk about it. Come on. - Just point that away. - Shut up. Keep your distance. Alright? Keep your distances. Let's talk about over pizza. Get my helmet. Who's this guy? This is Edmar. Good old Edmar. - Edgar. - That's right. He has a good deal going. He's offering only 50%, man. But this is something else. What is there to eat? There's pizza. Like always. I've got the munchies, man. The munchies? Then you'll eat with us. But I'll tell you what, the rest is ours. Hey, man, you don't even know what the deal is. So what? There's just two of us, man. You're doing it alone? Who made you Superman? Alright, man? This is Clayton, my partner, my right hand man! I'm fucked. I'm fucked. - I'm fucked. - I'm telling you. Can I have my cell phones back? What cell phone? I'm just kidding. Here it is. A cool one. Do I need to give it back? Hot pizza, mate. - Now you're talking. - Is there extra virgin olive oil? Fuck you. Eat this shit. The only extra virgin here is you, bitch! You realize that Edgar had to come back to Brazil. - This was inevitable. - I know. But... we have to forget this whole story. It's all right. Good. That's really good. Do you like working here? I do. Why? You're not thinking about quitting, are you? No away. I like the people here. - Are you considering firing me? - No, don't even think about that. No, you've been very valuable to me. And money? Everything ok with your pocket: Are you in need of some extra cash? Money is always good, but... for what I need, it's enough to live on. Alright. But if you need something, You can ask me, Okay? - Okay, - Alright? If you have any problems, you can talk to me. I'm asking you to talk to me. Alright? Well, I think it's time to tell Walter's story. And mine. Our story. Walter's story is divided into B, E, and A.E... Before Edgar and After Edgar. Well, this is my cue. This is the exact moment when I enter Walter's life. Ironically, the accident brought Walter near my family. My father was very touched by his situation... and offered him a job at his restaurant... as Walter had quit being a teacher. I managed to escape prosecution... and went for a break to Miami, Florida, USA. Velinha, here's the deal. Pay attention. Right. The car with the money is an armored car. - The guys will be armed. - We'll figure it out. Don't worry. This fucking air conditioner isn't working. Fuck that! Man, I think we were born in the wrong country. - I hear you, man. - You know where we could be? Norway, what do you think? New Zealand maybe. - Yeah, New Zealand! - New Zealand is cool. Norway is cold, and New Zealand only got kangaroos... - Kangaroos are in Australia! - Are you crazy? - Look at that. What a beauty! - What a ride, man! - How many could we buy? - Four. 500 grand a-piece. - In Brazil... - And where are we, man? If you're abroad you would buy in euros, dollars... Euro! He says it like a gringo, euro! - Asshole! - What's he doing? - Run! - Easy, this car is armored. Don't worry, man I'm going to run him down! - Motherfucker! - Fuck you, asshole! Get the motherfucker! Wait! Fuck, man! This isn't water! This is gasoline! This is gasoline! - Let's get out of here! - Hurry! I don't have it! Come on, Pela! Hurry! You go! I'll cover you! Go on! Get to their car! Come one you fagot! Assholes! Fucked. Go, Pela! We're gangsters, son... You've lost, nigger! Drop your gun. Do it! Come on! - Where's the money? - There is no fucking money. Where's the fucking bag? - Where? - Over there. Don't point, nigger! - It's over there. - Show it to me. - Don't point! Move your ass! - Fuck you, kid. Go on! Open it, nigger! - There's a locksmith down the street. - You're a funny guy? - Shit. - You're a funny guy? Where's the key? - It's in the car over there. - You're a tough guy? Come one! Move your fat ass! - Move it. - You'd better kill me. - Go ahead and kill me. - Open it! You open it. It's armored. Suck this, motherfucker! This fuck armored! So this is armored? - Watch him! - Go on, go on. - Don't move! - Motherfucker! Wait, I'm opening it. Wait, easy! - Please, be patient! - Come here. Who will suck it now? Wait! Easy, man! Come on! Easy, easy! - Wait! - Come on! Motherfuckers! Those guys robber us on a shitty little motorbike! Put your fucking arms down. Fuck that shit! We're fucked! Hi! - Is it here? - Fuck no. Are you crazy? Want me to walk around with the candy? It's in my car down there. - Let's go. - Come one, naughty boy. Hi. I'm where we have arranged! What? Are you kidding me? What do you mean with they've stolen the money? That's way too weird! I haven't told to anyone, not even to my wife. Ok! Ok! We talk later, bye. Son of a bitch! It's so weird! Holy fuck, man! I'm telling you, you loony. Be careful with that. Do you know what's in there? This is not for kids. I'm not playing around. Thanks, man. You take care. Time's running out, man. Things are tough. I know, Maicon, but... I don't know what to tell you. Who would've thought this could happen, you know? - Do you have any more money? - No, I don't. What? Even If I had. I say that because were the same situation as the Portuguese guy. What Portuguese guy? - The one from the toilet joke. - What joke, man? The Portuguese guy dropped a 10-dollar note in a toilet. But it wasn't a clean toilet... It was like a gas station one covered in shit. He didn't have the balls to fish the note out. You know? What did he do? He took a 50-buck note and dropped it in the shit, too. You see? Then it all changed. He changed the way he saw things... because now there were 60 bucks there in the shit... and for 60 bucks he was willing to stick his hand in... and that's how he got all his money back! That's really funny. But you're here to solve a very serious problem. - Another problem. - Fuck... Your wife robbed me. No, Maicon, Julia? No, Josiane. Do you have another wife? No, Maicon. Not Julia. Julia, your wife. That fucking snitch. No, you're making a mistake. She has nothing to do with it. And to prove you're not together with her in this... You're going to finish her. No, Maicon, Julia is my wife... Maicon, my wife! For God's sake! You must be kidding me! Am I fucking with you? Do I look like I'm fucking with you? Am I fucking with you? You choose, Henrique. Either you finish the cunt... or we do you and then we do her. Don't do this! Look at me. Look at me, you fuck! Stop crying. You point this gun in her face... - No, Maicon. - And you shoot. Shoot her in the face, do you understand? Shoot her in the face. Here This is your job. Hi, is it open? Ju? I need to talk to you. Where are you? Mr. M wants to see us. It's because of the robbery. He didn't want to talk over the phone. He sent me a text with GPS coordinates. He's getting meaner. Where are we? It's really far. I'm just following the GPS. No, Julia, don't tell me you're having a fit again. I can't breathe. I'm scared. - Scared of what? - Of having a meltdown. Relax. This is just your head, you're fine. Let me grab you a pill? - Ju! - What is this? - What is this? - You ruined our lives! - Are you crazy? - Why did you do it? You're pointing a gun at me! - Shut up! - Stop it! Turn away! Why did you...? Turn away from me! - Turn away! - Calm down... You ruined our life! I didn't do anything! Let me explain what happened! Calm down! Let me speak. Listen. Calm down, remember everything We've been through. Let your heart calm down. Are you calmer now? What's wrong? What's wrong? Where are you going? Come here! Wait! Henrique? Dear God. That piece of shit robbed me and he wanted to kill you! - What are you saying? - I found out. It was this piece of shit who planned the robbery! - There's more... - Are you crazy? I called him and told him... ...that it you have robbed the money and to prove his innocence he'd have to shoot you in the face. - Asshole! - Stop it, baby! Are you crazy? Asshole! Why did you do this? To be sure you were not part of the scheme. What if he had shot me? I wouldn't let him do that to my child. - Don't touch me. - It's a blessing in disguise. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. - I need to talk to you. - Excuse me. Go check upstairs. - Well... - I miss you. The baby is yours, I'm sure. I know. Woman's intuition, right? - Yeah, you could say that. - That's great, Julia. So, what are you doing? Have you talked to him? Of course not. Are you crazy? - I'll fix your problem first. - Don't worry about it now. We need to be patient, baby. You'll be so sexy, baby. Don't even think about abortion. - Hi, man. - What's up, Henrique? - How's it going? - How you doing? Your wife was telling me about the solution to our problem. - I was saying that... - Let's take a seat. - Come here... - Get off me! Look, you think you're so clever, right? So clever! How can you be so sure that he planned this robbery? Here, my love. Here! Here, nigger. Look. That easy? There's even an address. I'm calling Maicon. We found this at the asshole's office. - So what? - And the prick wrote down... the number of the idiot who did the job! You're an idiot. You're fine people, but nobody's going rip me off like that. - You're the idiot! - No way. Where's your money now? Where is all the fucking cash? - Tell me! - Take it easy, baby. It's taken care of. Let's go home. Let's get lost. Did you see the TV show last night? What TV show? The reality show. Do you know who was eliminated? It was the sexy blonde girl or the queer. I know, the show you were talking about the other day. Yeah. Did you see who got eliminated? - I don't watch it. - I think it's all a set up. The dude's kicked out and the blonde will... What happened, man? Talk to him. They grouped together to eliminate the guy. What guy? They grouped together to eliminate the guy! What guy, man? They grouped together to eliminate him! What are you saying? Do me a favor. Bring me my cell phone up here. No problem. Where is your phone? I don't know. It's on the table somewhere. - Say, you're taking it. - I'm taking it up there. - Say you're going up. - I'm going up. I'm coming. The roof caved in! Don't move, man! Don't move! Shit! Son of a bitch! - What's up, Velinha. - Who are you? Santa Claus. Bringing you a present. Santa Claus doesn't do shootings. Brother, I'll give you just one chance. I don't kill you, and you give me my money. Whose money, man? I don't even know you. - Who are you closed with? - I'm going to close you, nigger! - Give me my fucking money! - What are you talking about? - Clayton! - He's gone, my friend! - What did you do to my brother? - He's sitting on the Devil's lap! Hey, loser, take this. Let's fucking tear the place down! - Wait, brother! - Want another round? Look here! I'm done. Let's talk this out, okay? - You want some pizza? - Son of a bitch! What, it jammed? That's one ballsy nigger! Where is my money? You're giving me the finger? I'm going to cut it off. Bring me the sword. It's in the car, Bola. I didn't think we were going to use it. We're in the middle of the slums, it's dangerous out there... And you want me to go fetch a sword? What's that in your hand? Go get it. Going to do a fucking schedule for the usage of this dawn sword. Let me cut his head off. You want to cut his head off? The finger is mine. Deal. So, are you telling me or not? Will you wait for the sword to arrive? Go look around, go on. The fucker's not talking. Hey, nigger, I'm going to castrate you like a poodle. Get it? Bola, I found the money! You see? It didn't take me very long. He put the suitcase inside the oven, man! - It's nice and hot. - Way to go. Why did you change bags? THE BAG Velinha? Velinha? Hey man! Come on in! Velinha, Edmar came for his portion. - This is my friend Edgar. - What's up? - Who's that? - That's good old Fininho. He's my boy, you know? A great partner. Hey, what's that suitcase? I told you. We're sharing the cash... but this Louis Vuitton bag is for my mother. With this kind of cash you can buy the whole Louis Vuitton factory! - Look at that! - Fininho... Look at all that cash, man! Fininho, thanks for that day you helped me, okay? - Velinha, man? - Right? - Thanks, man. - What's the fuck, Velinha? - What is this? - Come on, Clayton! This is for your mother, too. She was there when I needed her. It's all ours, brother. You deserve it. Fininho, come here. Give it back. US$ 600,00 for me, you take the rest. - Okay! Look at me! - 007 in the house, man! - Look at me! - Shit, man! - Totally 007! - It's all ours. - It was a pleasure, man. - Thanks. Good luck. Just lost my patience with you. One or two? - One. - Two. Motherfucker! - Suck it up your ass. - Shit, man. - Give me the cell phone. - Fuck. - Give it to me and shut up. - Be quick, I'm low on credit. Big Boss? - Good evening, everybody. - Good evening. Today I would like to talk to you about a theme that is always relevant... at least in our country... we're going to talk about corruption. Hello? Hi. Okay, I'm putting it on now. Okay? Overbilling. Tax evasion. Buying elections. Nepotism. Buying judges, buying cops... Bribery. Money concealed in underpants... why the hell have we heard those words... and lived with those words... for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, Why don't we do anything? Why doesn't the situation change? Suggestions? - Hi. - Deputy? Hi, talk to me. Maicon, here, I have your money. This time it's for real. Alright. Where will it be? What do you mean? The usual place. - Jader? - What, Sofia? Your jacket. - Hello? - I'm not wearing a jacket. - Deputy? - Okay. - Say it, what time? - 11:30 h. I'll be there. Alright. Bye. I was watching you on TV. You know that deputy that was with us in Manaus? - What's his name? - That's Hernandez. Hernandez, that's right. Hernandez. I thought he was mocking you. You know, when you went up to speak... I think he started to badmouth you with that other guy... He's just a queer. Do you want anything, Sofia? A little money. - May I? - Of course! I'll give it to you. How much do you want? One, two hundred... Well. I must go now. Okay? Bye! Your ass is still nice and firm! You will see what's good! Ouch! That's a sexy little ass...! - Calm down. No, no, no. - Why not? - The play is over. - Are you cooling me off? Just for now, because you're late. Did you forget? Alright. - I'm really late. - That's right. Come here. No matter what happens, I love you. Okay? Bye. Stop, stop. Julia, come here. Come with me to deliver this suitcase. Hop in. - Why is that? - Cos you're beautiful, perfect. Come on. Are you asking me or ordering me? Deputy, this is Maicon. Listen, we're changing the place. Okay, Alright. I know where it is. I know. I'll be there shortly. Bye. Julia? TWO YEARS BEFORE Julia loves the sea. Hi. I love the sea, you know. She loves the sun. A man's hand. The wind. Do you want it? No. I love you. What did you say? - I didn't say anything. - Yes, you did. I heard you speak. - Did I? - Yeah. - Say it again. - I love you. I love you. I said I love you. - You can't say that. - I can. I love you. Out of the blue? - It was not out of the blue... - Why are you saying it now? - I said it because... - I know why. Because it's important... You're saying that now because you want to fuck me. I'm warning you... taking me over to your place might be dangerous. Why? Oh, why? Because we met in a shrink's waiting room, baby. So, we can be the Xanax couple. Mr. and Mrs. Rivotril. What do you say? I'm in. Yeah. You want to be that? A couple of loonies around town? - Fuck! - Watch out! You suffered a big blow to your head. You need to stay in the hospital overnight. Son... - Julia... - Calm down, son. - Julia... - Calm down. Two people were killed. A seven-year old boy and his mother. You'll have to be strong now, son. Justice in Brazil is peculiar. People kill and steal... but there's always a way to escape imprisonment. The sentence is commuted for good behavior... or you only serve one third of it. Sometimes you don't even go to jail. That was my case. It was this friendly justice that let me walk free... with a little help from deputy Jader. Besides, in my case the judge didn't want any problems. He had other interests. Boats. So? You didn't like my teddy bear. I loved this bear. I think he's cute. But I want this bear now... who will never ever leave me. What? Say it. What do you want to say? - You didn't miss me, did you? - I really missed you. No, you didn't. You were very well looked after. By two men. - Yeah, but I was thinking of you. - I know. Hey, it's true! I was thinking about you. Why did you have to leave? Well, let's go over the plan one more time. You must... No, I don't want to go over this plan again. I know all about it. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. THE PLAN Ok, let's go over it. First I plant one ideas on Maicon's head. You must be cold... with respect to this case. If you messed up and lost the money, it's your problem, man! Fuck it! After chaos has taken over, I collect all the evidence... and hand it to Rodrigues at the Prosecutor's Office. He'll love it. That's when my situation there will tighten up and so will Maicon's, consequently. At the Prosecutor's Office there's no more way. - They're watching me. - I'll need to transfer you. - Then enters Deputy Jader. - Two million. - Reais? - Dollars. When the deal is set, you find someone to get the money. Ok. I'll do my tricks. Then what? Well, with the money in our hands... I'll find a way to link Henrique to the robbery. I can plant something in his office. I don't know, I'll think of something. We take the money and disappear! Freedom, man... I'm worried, you know. About what? I fear what Maicon might do to Henrique. I like him, he's not a bad person. Nobody is bad. Henrique is not bad. Is Maicon bad? Is the deputy bad? Nobody is bad. People just go the wrong way sometimes. That's why I believe in punishment... in real justice. - What? - Punishment is the way... What do you mean? Are you crazy? What are you talking about? You're not God. You're doing this for the money, baby. At least I am. I don't want this life. I want to be happy. I want to be free, I want to love you. Don't you agree? Why are you so quiet? Why are you so quiet? Why are you quiet? You tell me now. Are you hiding something from me? - Of course not. - I knew it. Little kitten, come on. Do you swear? I do. I do. Do you swear that we'll get this money and leave... ...and be happy, you and I? You and I and this little being right here. I had forgotten. Really? I can't be smoking! I must stop this shit. Can I tell you something? You can. I want a girl. I really do. Answer... Answer... Aren't you going to answer? Who is it? It's the bank manager, I won't answer the phone. Answer it, girl... It's them. Let's go! Let's go! Julia, stop! Stop! Stop right there! Not one more step! Drop that suitcase and get out of there! He's armed! He's armed! What's up? Here Hi. Hi. This is very fragile. You must place it in something that he always carries with him. Do you think you can? Of course. Who is this fuck? Down! - Maicon, Bola was shot! - Julia! Edgar! - Come with me, Julia. - You're going to die, Menudinho! Fucking Stop right there! Oh, you punk! Come on! Stop! Stop! Get out of the car! - Get out! - Get him! Get down! Fuck! Stop! Stop! Come on, deputy! Go, go, go! What's that noise? What's that noise? - There's a bomb in the suitcase. - What? What the fuck was that? - Put the suitcase up here. - I'm not touching it! - Put it up here! - I'm not touching it! Or else it will explode, it has a proximity sensor! What? If the deputy gets near it, the suitcase will explode. Put the suitcase up here! Your Honor! That's your million dollars right here! See you there! This is an ungrateful world. I saved this asshole, and this is how he thanks me! He's getting near us! He's getting near us! This thing is going to explode! - I'm not on his tail. - Faster, faster! The bus! Watch out! Stop! Where did you fucking learn to drive? - The fucking bus got in the way! - Drive! Drive! Where did he go? Fucking punk! - Over there! That's his car! - That's my suitcase! - That's my money! - He must've run. Where is the prick? Where is the prick? Get your suitcase and let's beat it! My money... My Money. What? A faggot? No, never! He's a real man! It's a God's man! It's my hero! It's amazing his capacity, it's marvelous! Exemplary citizen! It's terrific! He's a champion, a total champion. Call me, Edgar. Got my number? We have confirmed that the man killed in the explosion... this morning in Baixada do Glicario was really the state deputy Jader Kerteis. Holy crap! Holy crap! Are you aware that we are fucked? How could you place a bomb there and not tell me? And I know this Maicon, he is crazy! He'll go to the end of the world to get his money! He'll do anything to get his money. You know that, don't you? He knows who I am. - Give me the cell phone. - I don't have it. - Where is it? - In my pants. - Dad? - Hi, son. I need to talk to you now. What's going on? Where are you? - Is the restaurant full? - More or less. - Walter didn't come to work. - Don't leave there. Don't leave, no matter what! I'm coming over. Bye. I'm going to the restaurant. I can't leave my father alone. - You want me to go with you? - No, you stay. - Are you sure? - You stay here. - Will you be careful? - Stay here. I'll be back soon. Dad? - What happened, Edgar? - Come with me. - Why? What happened? - I'll explain on the way. Explain what? Something happened to Walter? - Is that why he didn't come? - Yes and no... - What do you mean? - I'll explain. Explain what? What's going on, Edgar? - What happened? - We can go. Dad. Shut it. A presidential suite, son? Julia? My son, where did you get the money for this? Dad. Julia? She must've gone out to buy something. Julia? Were you calling me, Edgar? Nice photo, huh? What have you done with Julia? That's what I ask you, my friend. Where is my money and that whore? I don't know anything about any money or any whore. I'll ask again. Where is my money and that cunt? Get his old man! - Get him! - What is this? Calm down! - Don't! Don't! - Hold him down! - Bring the old man here. - Stop! Let me go! Wait, man! - Wait! - Hold him! - That's enough! - Wait! Let's talk! - Hold him down! - Wait! Gag him! Come on! - Gag this old prick! - Dad! Dad! - That's enough. - We'll only bleed you a little bit. - Scalpel, Rato. - Scalpel. Where will it be? - The spleen. - I can get the appendix here. The appendix will bleed too much and he will die fast. It can't be... - So? Appendix or spleen? - Spleen. - It's not easy to get it right. - Just fucking do it! Dad! Dad! Dad... - Injection, Rato. - Alright. - Done. - One down. Edgar? Your father suffered a small incision in his spleen... he will bleed a little... but with this injection he will live for more six hours. Okay? Is your father diabetic? Son of a bitch! Well, this way you make my job harder. - We need to check his pressure. - Six hours, Edgar. I'll wait for your call. - Bring the old man. - We need to check his pressure. Fuck his pressure! Just bring him! But we need to monitor him. Cut it! Just do it! Come on! Julia! Where were you? - Where were you? - Are you ok? Where were you? I was buying some fresh clothes for us. I was looking from the hall. - Did you see my father? - I did. They pierced my father with a fucking sword! Is your father alive? Is he dead? - I don't know... - Is your father alive? - Are you hurt? - I only have six hours... You're limping. Did they hurt you? Walter? - They took my father. - Why all this shit? I need to do that thing I asked you. Do you understand? Do you remember everything I said? Can I trust you? Here, boss. Say it, boy. Bet my balls that you would call. So, I want to make a deal with you. What deal? I'll give your money back, what else? But now your situation's got worse. Who told you I just want the money? - There's one more thing. - Say it. I'm listening; The girl is the only thing that's non-negotiable. The girl is mine. Right? So, that's what I have in mind. You are free. You and your father can go to hell, I don't care. I only have half the money. - What about the other half? - I've spent it. I got you. It's your compensation for the girl, right? Okay. I'll let you have half the money, pretty boy. Is that a deal? I choose the place, and only one car... If I see a second car, I quit. And fuck you all! They're here. Come on, pick up the old man! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop right there, Edgar! Dad? - Get the woman here. - Get off me! - Give me the bag. - Edgar! - Edgar! - I missed you, baby. You shouldn't have done that to me. So, Edgar... did you enjoy my girl? You have balls indeed, you'll keep half the money. Unfortunately, you won't be able to use it. Guys, to wrap it up... I would like to read a passage from a text I really appreciate... a text about death. Death gives meaning for our life... and even more importantly... death creates a special value for time. If our time in this life were undetermined... life itself would lose its meaning. We would probably be butt-naked and wielding spears. Death is nature's most powerful agent... it comes to take away the old and make room for the new. It is true. Our efforts to avoid it... and turn our short stay here into something minimally memorable... is our reason". isn't it? That is, there is life only because there is death. "La muerte". See you tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen. The boy traded you, did you know that? He sold you for half the money. That's the jungle, baby. Every man for himself. But did you really think that after all this I'd let you walk? Especially if you have my son in your belly. - Maicon? - What? Can I tell you something? Say it, baby. I lied to you. What? The baby is not yours. It's Edgar's. And there's one more thing. It's a girl. - Julia! - Crazy chick! Stop! Stop! Stop this shit! Listen, son! What about that red thing, what the fuck is that? Well, this one is different, want to see? I'll show you. This one, have a look... We connect and then... It works the same, but as inverse. Right, the same, but I didn't get shit! Bye, see you! Thanks, auntie! What happened, Maicon? I don't believe it! Son of a whore! Now I'm going to kill this bitch! Sometimes we need stand away from the paper... ...to understand the whole sketch with more clarity. Welcome to my plan.
