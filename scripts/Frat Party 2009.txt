I'm pretty famous around here for being an all-around good guy, friendly, decent looking, pretty smart. Kinda got it made. Hey, Duffy. How's it hanging? - Love you long time, Lexi. - Looking hot, Duff. Hey, Andrea. Graduation week... crazy. That's what I want to talk to you about. I have had a great four years here at TULA. I'm getting a business degree and I belong to the best fraternity on campus... Gamma House. See, I focus on one thing... okay, let's make that two things... during my college career: Getting laid and getting an MRS degree. Okay, you... you may laugh, but you know, the first three years we try to hook up with as many people as we possibly can. And then the last year, we try to find that perfect match. And let me tell you something, buddy boy. I found the perfect girl. Hey, Duff. - You may think that's her. - Why don't you call me anymore? But that's my ex. You certainly know why, Kell. I mean, no one loved you more. That's true. No one's crazier in bed. That's definitely true. And no one's hotter. No one. So then why, Duffy? Oh yeah, let me guess. Adriana? Tell that stupid rich bitch I said hi. That's not cool, Kell. That's not cool at all. Bye-bye, Duffy. See, that girl is amazing, but she's not the one. Okay, so I burned some bridges over the last three years of messing around. You see, I screwed around... a lot... a whole lot. Sandy Waves looks like a mermaid. She's beautiful in every way. It was like clockwork. I'd go to the gym, she'd get on top of me I think she's married to a chemistry teacher now, but she was really good on the bench. Ivana Humpalofsky... whoo. This girl was just one of a kind. - (rock music playing) - Every time we'd have sex, my ears would ring for three hours afterwards. The loudest orgasm you would ever hear in your life. Yeah! Oh! Bang bang bang! (moaning, screaming) Two naked twins are actually making out in my... my bed right now. Chloe and Katie... AKA every man's fantasy. - Oh! - Duffy's voice: I would play video games and talk to my buddies online. They would be there just making out with each other. Sometimes I'd watch. Sometimes I'd join. - Sometimes I'd make videos. - Hi. (women cooing) Professor Beaubier... what a woman, what a great teacher. I mean, they say teachers don't care about their students anymore. That's a lie. You know, I really appreciate you helping me, Miss "Boobier." It's Beaubier, "Duffay." - It's actually Duffy. - Mm. You know, this class is just so hard. Oh, really? It's really hard? - It's really hard. - Mm. - It's getting harder. - You need me to take some stress off from that... that hardness? - Duffy: Yeah, I don't like hard things. - No. Oh, no one does. Holy God. Oh! Duffy's voice: But that is all over now. No more one-night stands, no more walk of shames, no more threesomes. You see, I am in love and I'm getting married. Her name is Adriana. Adriana is, well... really really perfect. She is the most amazing girl I have ever met in my life and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. Okay, I admit it. That sounds cornball... but I mean it. See, this is the last week of college and after finals are over, I'm going to get married. I know it's a bit of a rush, but here's the rub. My fiance is a debutante and her family, they are super-social, super-rich Italians from the old country... very old school. You see, her father runs some global wine business. And he wants her to get married at the right church with the right reception at the right country club. The problem is the only time her family says we can get married is the week of graduation. I have no say. Babe, you know that Friday is the last party of my Gamma career and I can't miss it. Okay, it's just a stupid party. Who cares? No no, it's... it's like the most amazing party in the history of mankind. Mm, the most amazing party. Well, how can you go to the most amazing party when you have the most amazing woman to marry the next day? Well, just... just tell your Dad we'll do it another time. - I mean, seriously. - I can't do that, he'll fucking kill me. - (gasps) - (laughs) Fine. - Wait... - Duff, I know that look. - What are you thinking? - Okay, the wedding is Saturday night... Saturday. Yes. And the party is Friday. Genius, you're a genius. - Am I? - What do you mean? I mean, am I? Friday party, Saturday wedding. Wow. Okay. Just go. Just go to your stupid party. Really? You'd consider that? Going... going to the party? Yeah. Babe, fuckin' yeah. - (laughs) - Hell yeah. - Wow. - It's my last Gamma party... I picked a winner this time, didn't I? - Hey, please. - Papa's gonna be so proud. Papa... it's not... it's not a rehearsal dinner, it's just a family dinner. - And I should party... - Family, remember? - Yeah. - We're gonna be a family. - Can I please go? - No. - I'll make the wedding. Please? - No. No. Please? Isn't she so cute? I mean, what girl does that for her man? - Man: What's up, bitch! - Oh, here comes my fraternity brother - and best friend in the world. Mac! - Yo! - Hey. - Dude, last week of school, man, which means the countdown to waiting for the biggest party of all time is over! (laughs) And we don't get to go. Ah, it's... it's gonna be cool, Mac. I can't believe you're so cool about it. - I'm completely cool. - Yeah, but you're completely screwed. - How? - Dude, you are getting married - on Saturday. - So? So, the biggest party of all time is Friday which means we don't get to go. No way. - What do you mean "No way"? - No way am I missing my last night of freedom on the finest campus at the finest party with the finest friends at my fraternity, dude... - Gamma. - T-U-L-A! - (both grunt) - Yeah! No way I'm missing that. B... but... l... l... what do you mean? You've got to be kidding me, right? - No, I mean... - Dude, Adriana is going to hang you up by your balls - Well, she's not going to be happy. - Oh, no shit. But she's... she's cool with it. Dude... (sniffs) Check this out. Check this out. (muttering) It's weird, you know? It's like school's over and you hated going, but now that it's done you wish you could go back, you know? We had some good times though. - I'm going to miss it. - Me too, man. Oh, speak of the devil, bro. Here comes Adriana and her fucking hot-ass friends. Why are all her friends so fucking hot? What's up, baby girl? Hey, Adriana. Hey, Kristen. Hey, Cherie. Hey, baby. Want to go take a walk with me? Sure enough. - Take that. - Okay. I'll see you guys later. Hey, I was just about to get down on some video games. Fuck you, Duffy! So, what are you gonna do? - About what? - Don't be coy with me, Duffy. Babe, come on. This is the last party of my college career. It's going to be amazing. I'm going to talk about it for like 30 years. All my buddies are going to be there. Yeah, it's all your nasty, porn-addicted, gross, perverted buddies. Gamma House? Really, babe. Come on. You could've done so much better. That place is disgusting. I'm offended. I'm a little bit offended. It's... it's actually the best fraternity in history. - Mm. Mm-hmm. - It was in a magazine. Oh, cool. "Frat Boy Mag"? - Yeah, so? - Awesome. (clears throat) Come on, Duffy. Come home with me, all right? Our wedding is in two days. Do you realize that? - Two days. - Okay. I will see you on Saturday morning. - (groans) - I'm not supposed to see the bride - before the wedding, anyways. - I will take the red-eye. What? You're going to take a red-eye to your own wedding? It's an easy flight. I'll be there first thing in the morning. Yeah... hung-over. Is Kelly going? - What? - Kelly. Kelly, you know? Kelly... Kelly Kelly... - whore Kelly... slut Kelly... - Yeah, I know... - Remember? Kelly? - Yeah. I don't know... I don't know if she's going to be there. - I don't know who's going to be there. - God. Yeah. - It's a big party. - Mm-hmm. Duffy, if you so much as touch her arm, you're dead meat. You have nothing to worry about. It's not you I'm worried about. It's your friends and all of your ex-girlfriends. Babe, it's just... your father has a thousand divisions and they're all in these little tiny countries. - (laughs) - And so, this is the last time I'm going to be on American soil for a long time. Duffy, come on. You know you need to learn the business. And Bulgaria? Oh my God, how much fun. Whoa... Bulgaria? - Yeah. - You didn't tell me Bulgaria! Bulgaria... like prostitution's the biggest way - to make money in Bulgaria. - (laughs) That place is scary, babe. I need... okay. That... that just proves my point. I need to be here. I need to party one last time in the United States of America... - Oh yes. ...because I'm a patriot. - (laughs) - And I'm gonna marry you in this great country on this soil because I pledge my allegiance to you... - (laughs) ...because I love you. You are fucking nuts. Do you know that? And that might be one of the reasons why I love you. Have I ever told you I dreamt about you - when I was like 10 years old? - Mm. No. You were the same size, the same age, - but I was 10 and I remember you. - (laughs) - You're a dork. - I know. I swear to God, you call me. Do you understand? You call me from the party, you call me when you get to LAX and you call me when you land in San Francisco, okay? Do not forget. You call me, Duffy. - So, what... what am I doing again? - Oh, you're calling me. Oh, call you. Yeah, I'll call you. I'll call you whenever I have service and I will see you first thing in the morning in Napa for our wedding. Papa's gonna kill you. Mm. Babe, we... we talked about it and he didn't even care. He just... he was more concerned about his friends and the family, everyone going to the wedding. And I promise you, when I get to that reception, I will just lick his asshole clean... Eww. And you'd better, okay? You need to make him love you. I will. Well, I'll see you in Napa. (rock music playing) # Last night I met this girl # (rock music playing) # Last night I met this girl # # Her name was December # # She asked me if I would... # So, what'd she say, bro? She's gonna let me do it! Oh my God! Dude, you are the man! - Of course. - I can't believe she let you do it. Dude Mac, we talked about this months ago. She's cool with it. What about the rehearsal dinner? Technically, it's a family dinner the night before the wedding, so it's not that big of a deal. Semantics, dude, semantics. Home sweet home. # Baby, are you such a cutie? # # She asked me "Is yours guaranteed?" # - # Now could you talk to me? # - Hi, Duffy. Duffy: Hi... Olivia? - Close enough. - # What do you mean? # # Said now, baby # # Are you such a cutie? # # She asked me "Is yours guaranteed?" # # Now could you talk to me? # # I said I've fallen... # Yeah, I'm gonna need three iron maidens. I'm looking for handcuffs, firecrackers, lube, olive juice... this might sound weird, but how much are clowns? We need magic at this party. Um, let me know ASAP. Okay. TTYL. (smooches) Chadster! - Chad: What is up? - What the hell are you ordering, bro? - Supplies, my brother. - What's up, buddy? - Duffy-Duff-Duff. - Mac: Sounds nice. Guys, this party's gonna be off the fucking chain. Dude, sounds like it. That's why we put your ass in charge. Yeah, of course. I've been working since 6:00 A.M., - I don't stop. - Gamma Spa open. - Oh, yes. - Chad: No. - Gamma Spa! - Chad: Not me, not me. Guys, I no longer deal with anything Asian. Duffy: That is the most racist thing I've ever heard. I think she's Chinese anyway, bro. Look, forget him. Me and you, Duff. - She's got two hands. - You see that? "No full service." Yeah, that's for people who aren't Gamma. Come on. - Hey, sweetie. - I didn't know we had a statue of you. Mac: Shut up. It's just me on a toilet. Hey! Let me see them cheeks! (laughs) (Asian flute music playing) - Here, Macky. - (Mac giggles) Hey, massage only, buddy. Dude, come on. Don't be such a puss. Puss? Bro, l... I'm engaged. I'm getting married. Yeah, you're getting married. Key word..."getting." Make this your last one. It'll be cool. And no bachelor party shit. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm your best man! It's my job to throw you the sickest bachelor party. Dude-dude-dude... bachelor party, frat party all combined into one. Being here is my bachelor party. No. You being here is a fucking happy ending. The bachelor party's after this. Duffy: Oh, God. Massage only. Mac: Yeah, for now. He might change his mind and get the... (clicks teeth) With me. My God, Adriana. What? What? I mean, come on now. He should be going with you right now. Would you stop it? It's gonna be fine. - No, he's a piece of shit. - Oh my God. Oh my God. Okay? You're my bridesmaid in my wedding. - You need to stop. - And I don't think it's right... - Right? - Yes, Duffy is a nice guy. - Yeah. - He's gonna be a good boy at the party. - Yeah. - Then why wouldn't he come with her today? I mean... It's his last night. Would you stop? - Okay. - Exactly. - Oh, God. - It's going to be so fun anyway. - Yeah and our dresses... - I know. - Our dresses are so pretty... - Yeah, but he... The party is gonna rock and he's gonna make up for it. He told me he was gonna kiss my dad's ass. Oh, he's gonna have to do that and kiss your ass. I'm fine. I told him he could go. - I trust him. I love him. Enough. - Yeah. - (phone ringing) - No. It's my sister. - I'll see you guys later. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Let's go. - Adriana: Hi. - Is he coming to the family dinner Friday? - No. - Adriana, Papa's gonna be angry. (groans) You know what? I don't have time for this. I'll see you later. Bye. (Mac sighs) Dude, I'm so glad that you're going to be coming to our final frat party. It'd suck without you, bro. Oh yeah, it feels good. It's probably the dumbest decision I've ever made, but you know what? Adriana's Dad is pissing me off. I mean, this is like my last day of freedom. Mac: Right. And you're stepping up to him showing him that you can be the man, you know? That's awesome. It's kind of crazy, you know? It's our last party of college. I'm going to miss you guys. Mac: I know, bro. I'm going to miss you too. It is weird to think that it's all over, man. Real life's gonna suck. (men sighing) So... dude... you gonna roll over and join me in a farewell happy ending, huh? (laughs) Yeah, dude, real men don't do that together. Oh, okay. All right, why don't you just lie there with your own insecurities and try to keep it down. 'Cause I'm getting a happy ending without ya. Okay. (grunts) Hey, baby. How about a happy ending for your favorite customer? You get no happy ending because what you did last time, you bad boy... Come on, baby, that was... look, I was... I was pent up that last time. - No... - No no no, listen listen. I'll wait, okay? - I'll wait this time, I promise. - You never wait last time. But you be careful this time, okay? I will, I promise. Okay. (Mac moaning) Mac: Oh, God, that is nice. You know, if you... if you take your top off, it would really help me just concentrate more. Yeah, just... it's cool, right? (moans) Yeah. (grunts) Oh ho-ho-ho-ho. Now, that is nice. (Mac moaning, laughing) Mac: Your hands are cold. Oh, God, you look so fine. Your body's so amazing. And this... this wrist thing is just good. Oh, man. What kind of lotion is this? It's like self-warming. Oh! Oh, God! Oh... oh, yeah! - Yes! Yes! - No! No! - Yes! - (shouting) (Mac moaning, yelling) Oh, I just went. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My bad. It's no big, deal, right... (screams) - Son of a bitch! - Macky! Oh shit, you fucking... what is wrong with you? - (woman laughs) - Oh my God. You just threw my shit back on me. That's fucking disgusting. Masseuse: Macky! No more Macky! You promised to wait for nappy-Macky! Where's my nappy now? Where's my nappy?! Okay! Okay, listen, I'm gonna get ready to... - Oh! Son of a bitch! - Duffy: I'm out of here. You can dish it, - but you cannot take the Macky. - Mac: Oh fuck! Yes! It's all over my fucking face! Are you happy? You get paid for this shit! Duffy: Thank you. Thank you. - You have great hands. - Can I get a fucking nappy? Please? - (water running) - What an amazing massage. - I loved her hands. - (gasping) Yeah? Fuck an amazing massage. My shit traumatized me. I'm going to have nightmares about girls flinging come on me the rest of my life! It sucks! I'm never going back to that place. Two-for-one coupon, my ass! You know that girl was a tranny, right? (rock music playing) You know I hate you, right? You know I love you, right? Mm-hmm. Don't fuck this up, okay? - I won't. - Mm. See you tomorrow. Yeah? You're a jerk. And you'd better fucking call me. (Adriana giggles) You better drive safe - or I'll cut your head off. - (car starts) (rock music playing) (neighs) (sighs) Adriana! Adriana! This boy Duffy, where is he? The wedding is tomorrow. Adriana! Adriana! Papa! I told you he will be here late tonight. Enough. # I wanna take you with me... # (grunts) # Far away # # Makes me feel like you are far away... # Man: Aww! Time out. Come on, you're throwing me off... - Shh! Shh shh! Shh... - You don't have to do that... - Shh. - Come here. Hug it out. - It's okay. - Jeez. - We all can't... stop. - I'm a girl. You don't have to... - Seriously. Shh. - You don't have to do it. - Just let... - Hey. Go back to your side. Hey hey, Adriana. Hey, Stefano. Didn't realize you'd be here. - You're looking good. - Thanks. Adriana, I invited Stefano here for your homecoming. He misses you. I haven't dated Stefano since boarding school and last I checked, he's dating Michela. Yeah, we're not dating anymore. Yeah, l... I actually put a bag over her head when we were in the bedroom. Um, it's kind of weird. She has some bumps. I'm a little freaked out by 'em, but it's okay. Please please, have a toast with us. Come have some wine. Thanks, Papa. And to my wedding too. Come come, sit sit, drink. This Duffy, your no-good boyfriend, he's not making a family dinner so he can go to a party. It's more than a party, okay? We're gonna be overseas for years and he just wants to say goodbye to his friends. It's ridiculous. - I think you should consider Stefano. - (gasps) I knew it. - Michela! - It's decided. Adriana, baby, look, come here, come here. - Look... - Oh, God. It's always been you. You've got to be kidding me. You dated my little sister. I know, but I've always loved you. That's disgusting, okay? Michela, say something! What do you want me to say? He doesn't want to marry me. Okay, you know what? This is insane. It's not the Old Country anymore, Papa. Okay? I'm marrying Duffy. Adriana, wait up. Stefano, let her go. You better get to the university right away. - I won't let you down. - You'd better not. Now, go say goodbye to the girls. Come on. Go. (distant rock music playing) Jesus, Stefano! Get out! Adriana, I just want to tell you - I've always loved you. - Oh, God. - I've always loved you. - Stefano, we're not dressed. Get out. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. (giggles) What do you see in him? What? Marry him. Fuck, Michela! Shut up already. (groans) - (shouting, cheering) - (rock music playing) - (shouting, cheering) - (rock music playing) Last party of the year, bro. - Yeah, bro. I hope you get laid. - Yeah, bro.

Where are the girls at? (guys cheering) Good eyes, bro. Good eyes. - That's what I'm talking about. - But that's still normal. - It's normal. - Normal? Dude, strip beer pong! (all cheering) Whoo! All: Oh! - Normal! - Oh my God. You know what? You guys... you guys are hard to impress, but follow me, both of you... - Uh-huh? ...to the theme rooms. - Theme rooms! - Oh my! Mac: Theme rooms! (man vocalizing) (hip-hop music playing) Gentlemen, I simply call this room... "The Club." - Nice. - Wow. Chad, it is looking much much better. Please save your compliments until the end of the tour. - Move, come on. - I'm going. # You know it's like fire # # I ain't tired, I feel wired # # It's my desire... # Thanks.

Come on, dude! - Yeah, it's my turn. - Wait, I'm not done, I'm not done. - Oh, stop... - Duffy, come on. You're gonna shoot me. Look. Look look look. You're not gonna touch, you're just gonna shoot. - Chad: Oh my God. You've gotta... - Shh! No offense, but l... I can't do that. # So beg me... # Um, I'm... I'm a little insulted. I said no offense, but if you're a little offended, I'm sorry, Kell because... Are you fucking kidding me? You know what? Screw you. Pablo! That's your name, right? You want to shoot me? - Pablo: Hell yeah. - Kelly: All right, let's go. Bye! See you later! Yeah, run along! Run along! - I'm sorry. - Kelly: Yeah, whatever. - I love your tits. - Kelly: Uh-huh. - (all chattering) - Kelly: Yeah, it's cool. Whatever. - Give me the tiger... tiger. - (hisses) That's... that's the shit I'm talking about right there, dude. That's that shit. # I hope this will do for me... # Duff. - Duff. Duffy. - Chad. - Duffy. - Chad. - (laughs) - Duffy! Chad, what the fuck? Well, uh, I'm sad. We're both sad. - Because? - You're getting married. - You're getting married, bro! - Both: You're getting married! Married forever! Forever married! I know, I'm getting married. I'm sorry. Well, because we love you, - we got you a present. - A big present. - Big present! - I'm so jealous. - I'm so jealous! - It's like the best present ever. Okay, what is it? - Porn star! - Porn star, bro! - Motherfuckin' porn star! - Porn star! What the fuck are you talking about? Right there behind this door is a real live human fucking porn star for you to fuck the shit out of! - Yeah, that's a good one. - In your room, porn star, for you, Duff. Duffy, if there is not a porn star in that room when you open the door, I will personally suck your dick. There is no fucking way that there is a porn star in this Gamma House in my room. - Oh, really? - Yes. Okay, well, how about this? Bam! Duffy, right? Duffy: Hey. Yeah. Hello. Oh, God. Mission accomplished. It's really on, dude. He's not going to know. (laughing) I know. I need Vicodin. You're... you're Jesse Jane. You have really considerate friends, Duffy. Yeah. You know, I don't offer myself to a lot of people. (pop music playing) - You don't? - Uh-uh. I'm doing this as a favor for Chad. Yeah, I mean, porn's different, but on the other hand, I'm a really nice girl. Yeah, you look like a nice girl. I'm from a really small town. - I'm from a small town. - Where at? Oklahoma. No way, I'm from Oklahoma. We... we actually went to the same high school. - We did? - Yeah. - Have I met you? - No, but we brushed arms one time like walking by. Huh. Well, what's it gonna be, bachelor boy? Um... um... what... what do you mean? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You're cute. I owe Chad a favor and you're getting married. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. So do you want to have sex with me? Uh... s... yeah... sex with... with... with... with you? Sex with me. Sex with... with you. Are you hard of fucking hearing? - (moans) - Oh, shit. I'm not... I'm actually not hard of hearing. - But you're hard. - Yeah. Um, this is... this is incredible, - I need to tell you. - Mm, yeah. - Oh my God. - (moaning) - Take you clothes off. - My... my clothes too? - Yeah, I want your clothes off. - Okay. - Come on. - I've gotta get this button. Come on. Oh, come on, take your clothes off! - Okay, yeah yeah... - I'm horny. Fuck me, Duffy! Fuck me, Duffy! - (Duffy muttering) - (Jesse moaning) - Jesse: Oh, God. - Duffy: Oh, yeah. - Okay. That's nice. - (moaning loudly) You know what? You know what? L... l... l... I can't. I can't. I can't... I can't do this. I'm sorry. - What?! - It's just that... I'm getting married tomorrow. - So... - What the fuck! - It's just... - (gasps) I, um... you're really hot, but... Do you know how many guys turn me down topless? - Three? - None, you fuck! Jesse, listen, um... good Lord, you know? - (sighs) - I'm attracted to you. It's... it's... I just... Jesse: No shit? I really want to do you. You know, I love my fiance. Really? That's sweet. But you're missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I wish that I was a dog and that I was still a freshman or a sophomore or a junior or it was beginning of senior year because I would fuck the living shit out of you. But you know what? L... I would never hurt my girlfriend. Are you sure there's nothing you wouldn't do? Um... but... Nothing at all you wouldn't wanna... try out? Yeah yeah, okay. Let's stop. Let's just stop right here because... I really do love her and as much as I love Jesse Jane, I need to go and, uh... She's... she's a really lucky girl. - You think so? - You turned me down, so yeah, I think so. Thank you. I'm gonna, um... I'm gonna go. - Okay. - Thanks for coming. - And, uh... - Thanks for not coming. Would you sign my fridge? Please? - Sure. - There's a Sharpie in that mug over there. Okay. I will. I'll sign you fridge. - Can I kiss that bunny? - You wanna kiss my bunny? Yeah. There you go. - I always wanted to do that. - (giggles) - I'm gonna get married! - Whoo-hoo! # I can survive # - # Ooh # - Hey, Duff. - Hey. Hey hey. - Where's your girlfriend, big boy? - She's actually not here. - Oh! Lucky for me then. Yeah, no no no. Actually, I'm getting married. - I'm getting married tomorrow. - Really? - Yeah. - Shouldn't you be at the rehearsal... Yes! L... I should. I should be there. So, l... I'm going right now. Yeah, I'll meet you upstairs. Yeah? Upstairs. Holy God. (cheering, shouting) Mac! Mac! Come on, boy! (smooches) Come on! (whistles) Damn it! Get over here! Did you see me sucking face with that hot chick? Shh! See that guy? Him. That dude right there does not belong here. Mac: What... what? That's Adriana's ex-boyfriend. It's her sister's... Duff, did you fuck her? - No. - No?! - No! - No?! - No, dickhead! - Dude, I would've fucked her! - I know you would've... - You didn't fuck Jesse Jane? - I spent all my money on that chick. - Way to go, bro. By the way, Mac, the girl you're making out with has herpes. Anyways, follow me (French accent) To the sex dungeon. Yeah, like big-time herpes. I got it from her. Can I go back up there with Jesse Jane then? 'Cause it won't matter. Duffy: Come on. - (industrial music playing) - (Chad humming) - (industrial music playing) - (Chad humming) Man: Oh, wow. Duffy-Duff, meet Jennifer, your sex dungeon goddess. Jesus, Chad. L... you look so... (grunting) - Oh, shit. - Oh, man! - I can't watch. - Damn it. - Oh my God. - Damn it! You literally just made him ejaculate in his boxer shorts. - Mac: Oh, God! - Clean him up. I'm gonna do that. - (groans) - Sorry, Mac's always had a thing for you. (chuckles) Yeah. Both: L... - I had no idea, Jenn. - Yeah, well, I figured I'd never see these guys again, so... I'm more surprised to see you here. I thought you were... I thought you were getting married. I am, tomorrow. You know, you should've married me, Duff. I mean... Kelly? Lily? And Adriana? Are you serious? I am the one for you. Um, that was like three and a half years ago. I know, but it's always so good to see you. You just gotta let it go. Okay, look, why don't we do a little goodbye present? Say, a little sadomasochistic present from me to you? - Um... - Come on, what do you say? That's really sweet. Could you do me a favor? (stammers) Oh, yeah, you want sex, no whipping. (laughing) - No sex... - What? ...unfortunately. Um, I need you to do me a big favor. - Um, okay. - Okay, there's this guy. - He's spying on me, all right? - (laughs) - Seriously? - Yeah, seriously. It's weird, I know, but Adriana's family... probably her dad... hired this guy Stefano to come and, you know, spy on me. And why would they be spying on you? I don't know, nervous about the wedding I guess. (laughs) No, probably because you skipped out on the rehearsal dinner. (laughs) How did you know about... it's not... it's not a rehearsal dinner. It's actually a family... That is what it's called, Duffy. That is what happens the night before the wedding. It's a rehearsal dinner. - I'm allowed to miss it. - No, you're not. Would you help me out, please? So, you want me to lure him in and tease him and then tie him up so that he can't leave, right? That's exactly what I was gonna say. That's so weird. - Oh! - (whip cracks) - Ow! - That's exactly why I'm the one for you. That's not the one at all. Duffy! What the fuck? I give you this leather, hot piece of ass and you talk? Treat her like a piggy bank and put things inside her. Look! - Don't you see? - There's this thing. - Chad Chad Chad. Okay, cool. - What? I need you to do something for me. I am doing something for you. Look at this hot piece of ass. - (giggles) - Yeah, all right. You guys can hook up whenever you want to, but for now, I need you to go and find the Stefano guy, bring him here and introduce him to Jennifer. Oh, I hate that guy. I saw him upstairs. He's an asshole. - Yeah. - I was gonna say something mean, but I'm scared of people. Well, you know what? Don't worry about it. - I'll change his tune. - Okay. - Yeah. - So, I'll go get him while you kind of do things to her. - Give me a few minutes. - All right. - We'll set it up. - You know what I'm talking about? Hey, hide your panties. - Still wet. - Hi, Jenn. Uh-huh. So, when he comes up, I want you to just like tie him up... - Yeah yeah yeah... - Seduce him a little bit. This is gonna be my plan. We're gonna undress you. Take it off, take it off. Okay. So we're going to get you undressed. - Okay? Help me. - Sorry. Sorry. - I'm still... - Do it before he gets down here. - I want him to see you. - That's a good idea. - Yeah, it's gonna be perfect. - Okay. Because I want him to see exactly what we're going to do to him. - Okay. - He has to believe it. - Okay, cool. - Okay. - Are you ready? - These come off too? Yeah, everything. Shoes. Take 'em off. - Okay. - Okay. - This sounds like it... - No, I promise. I promise. Take your socks off, it looks terrible. - Duffy: Um... - Okay. Okay, now... this is the best part. So, I'm going to tie him like this. I'm going to show you, okay? So, come stand right here. Okay? Now, I'm gonna put your hands in here. - Okay. - Like this and then we're gonna go... (chirps) Tighten 'em. - Yeah. - Go like this. Gonna pull 'em up. - (Jennifer chirps) - Yeah. - This is gonna be awesome. - 'Cause then he can't do anything. I know, it's perfect. And then, your other hand. - Oh, both hands. - Oh, yeah. They can't be free. Come on. - Duffy: I get it though. - Right? No. We have to do it. - He has to see... - Duffy: Be like practicing or something... That's right. - Back? - Tighten that shit up. - Ready? - Yeah, okay. Okay. We can pull out our toys and we can decide everything we want to do to him when he comes down here, right? Well, l... I already know what I want you to do... - Like what? You tell me. - I want you to tie him up like this. - Uh-huh? - And I want you to speed-bag his balls like you're a boxer, just boom boom boom. - Ooh, I would love to. - Okay. And then maybe you can pour some hot wax on them. - Uh-huh. - Maybe take that shovel off the wall - and shove it up his anus. - Okay. - Not supposed to grab that. - What, your package? - Yeah. - Aww. Is Adriana gonna get so upset? Aww, I'm so worried. I mean... - So, can l... - Tell her I had it first. Oh, I'm not gonna tell her that. Can I get... can I get out now. - Can you... can I get out of this though? - No. - I have to show him exactly... - Oh, like... like I'm a part of it. Right, you're... you're the display so he knows, right? Do I have to really be in my underwear for this? Oh, I could strip you down. No, I don't want to be naked. I thought maybe I'd wear jeans - or something like that. - No. - This is way more fun. - Oh, fun. So, what kind of games are you playing? (giggles) Hey, thanks a lot. Oh! What's going on? Hey. Hey. Uh, do we... um... do I know you? Um, nope. I'm actually, uh... I'm actually a foreign exchange student. So, I don't think you know me. - He's not from around here. - Okay. Well, guess what? You know what? We throw big parties especially for people who are, you know, like you. - Like this one. - Yeah. So, why don't you join us in the sex dungeon? Well, not us... not us. We got girls. Yeah yeah yeah, not... not us... not us three... - Not us in the sex dungeon. - But a sex dungeon. - It's like... it's like... - We're going to take you it... - take you to it. - It's like the Renaissance Faire - with chlamydia. - Okay. - But not all of 'em... - Just, uh, give me one second, okay? Okay. L... I'll be right back. You just wait right here for me, okay? Just wait right here. Hey, who's that guy? (Jennifer moans) So much fun, as I promised. - I can't wait. - (laughs) Me either. (sighs) - Oh! - (laughs) Hey, Jennifer, we have a new player! Ooh, bring him in. Ooh! Is this my next conquest? (Stefano laughs) Come over here. You want to join in the fun? Stefano! What are you doing here, bro? Duff, l... I thought you were getting married. Uh, tomorrow, buddy. This is freedom. You want to, uh, let me tie you up? Oh, no, I'm... I'm good. Thanks. Oh, okay. Come on, bro. Just let her tie you up, dude. It's my last night of freedom. I mean, you've been bad, right? - Oh yeah, I mean... - He's been real bad. Oh-ho! Then it'll be fun. - Let's tie you up. - Well, I mean, I guess I could get tied up a little bit. Come here. Give me that wrist. I always... two is always more fun than one. Oh, like this? This is how you get tied up? - Yeah. - You know, the funny thing - about this knot is... - Jennifer: Is what? Oh, Duff. Oops. - (Jennifer laughs) - Oh. Tie him back up. - Whoa! What? - Looks like you have a little problem here, Duffy. What the... shit... - Jennifer: Yeah. - Whoa! - Fuck you, Duffy. - Fuck me? - Yeah. - You don't get it, do you? You don't get it. Your little rich bitch... her daddy paid him to set you up. Okay, this isn't funny and you're supposed to tie his ass up. Shh shh shh shh. - Fuck you, Duffy. - Whoa... fuck me? - Yeah. Fuck you. - W... why? How does it make you feel? Do you feel helpless right now? - I feel... - You broke my heart, you fucker. Oh, God. Ow! - Payback's a bitch, Duffy. - Obviously. You like being helpless? Watch this. Oh... no. (muttering) - Put a ball in your mouth. - Let me get on a plane. Can I get on a plane, please? If I miss the flight, dude, it's... I'm not gonna get married. - Jennifer: What... what? Oh, bummer. - Dude, there's one flight out. I get married tomorrow. Just let me get on the friggin' plane. Oh, God... (muttering) - (Duffy groaning) - Now, that's all better, isn't it? How's that taste? Does it taste good? - Mm-mm. - No, it doesn't. - How do you like being tortured? Huh? - Mm-mm. I can give you a little bit more, Duffy. - Mm-mm. - You deserve it. You're a complete prick. Now, as much as I would enjoy staying to play with you, because I mean, as we can see, you've been trying to go to the gym, but you missed a little spot... so, I'm going to leave you here all by yourself to think about things, okay? - (groaning, muttering) - Bye, princess. Good. - Bye, Duff. - (screams) - Later, Duffy. - (yelling) # Is what I said # # But there's a place that... # I almost forgot. - (screams) - That's gotta hurt. (dialing) (phone ringing) (groans, sighs) Man: Let's go, let's go, let's go! Man: Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Everybody out! - (men shouting) (folk music playing) Whoa-ho! (screaming) (phone ringing) (snoring) (sniffs) Mom? Mom? Mom? # Baby, keep you by my side # # No use in trying... # What a great end to a solid four years. I'm gonna miss this place. I'm gonna miss girls like you... so much. Mac: Hell yeah, bro. I met some really cool people, but you and Duffy... I love you guys. Bro. - Where is Duffy? - (Mac laughs) Fuck. I haven't seen him in like... holy shit, what time is it? - Holy shit. - Chad: Oh no, dude. He's fucking that bitch Jennifer in the dungeon, right? No, she left with that foreign guy that blew me off last night. He was kind of cute. You talk? Shit! Shit! Chad! He's gonna miss his fucking flight! We missed it! He's gonna miss the whole fucking wedding, man! We gotta get him! Fucking shit! - Come on, bro! - I can't believe she talks! (rattling) Oh! Jeez, Duff! What happened? - (muttering) - You don't know? (grunting) Oh! - What happened, bro? - (spits) - You okay? - Yeah, untie me! Jesus. God. Jennifer and that damn Stefano dude, they were working together. And then... and then Adriana's dad paid him to come here and get in my way... Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Dude, slow down, slow down, man. - What's going on? - What time is it? It's 4:00 AM Dude, we way missed our flights. Hey hey hey, don't worry. - Now you don't have to get married. - No, fuck that. I'm not missing my fucking wedding, dude. - We're driving it. - Whoa! Whoa, dude. The drive, that's like six hours from now. Well, there's no more flights out, man. What are we gonna do? I've been up all night, it was a crazy party last night. Can we just like chill out and maybe reschedule? - We could do it next weekend. - No. You drive, I'll sleep. Come on. (Mac groans) (dialing) (ringing) Come on, motherfucker. Answer the phone. (ringing) (rock music playing) (grunts) Duffy: All right, dude. - I think I'm gonna take a nap. - Oh. That's cool, man. That's why I'm driving, you know? Gotta make sure you look good for the bride. I know, a little beauty sleep. That's good, man. (dialing) (phone ringing) Duffy's voice: Hey, this is Duffy. Leave a message. Hey, honey, it's me. Just calling to see where you're at. I wanted to let you know the dinner went really well. And I miss you and I love you. I can't wait to see you. Bye, baby. (smooches) Not answering? He's probably still on the plane. He should be her by now. - (sighs) - You worried? - No. - Really? Michela, you bitch, shut up. (chuckles) - (hip-hop music playing) - (people moaning) (rock music playing) I can't fly that slow! # Come on, let go, so I have to show you why I'm going, showing # # Everybody's knowing that it's so sad # # It's so bad # # I used to be # # The one who # # Had to # # Criticize me # # And it holds you... # - (hip-hop music playing) - (both giggling) - (moaning) - Oh, God. I'm bigger than a tree. I'm bigger than Tommy Lee. I'm hung like a motherfucking baby donkey. Shh. Jesse. (laughs) Jesse? - Oh, shit! - (moaning) Shit! Oh, no! No! No! (grunts) (rock music playing) Dude, where's... where's my cell phone? It's probably in the back, man. Shit, dude. Where's my cell phone? Dude, check in the back. # I stared the Devil in the face until I went blind... # Bro, I didn't call Adriana! - (huffs) - I didn't call Adriana. Hey, it's not a big deal. You're going to go down there and marry her. You have the rest of your life to fight over it. Okay. I need your cell phone. Dude, she can wait. We're gonna be there in a couple hours. She probably thinks I'm not coming. Mac: Of course, you're coming. It's ridiculous. - Just give me your cell phone. - I can't let you use my cell phone. I'm over on weekend minutes. My mom's gonna kill me if I use them up again. Adriana's gonna kill me and I'm gonna kill you. - Just let me use your cell phone. - Dang it, Duff. Just try and make it quick. No lovey-dovey smooshy crap. Duffy: Give me that phone, man. # Here we go again... # There's... there's no bars. - There's no bars, dude! - Shake it. I'm not... shake... what? Shake the phone, sometimes the bars come in. The antenna's a little weary. - (grunting) - Now check. No bars, dude. Drive... drive this... here. - Hold on. - I'm just trying to... just try to like... - Drive! - I'm driving! Duffy: Mac, your phone is dead. (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) (whirring) (dialing) (sighs) Come on. (sighs) Michela: No answer? Shit, Micky. What am I gonna do? Sorry. Maybe he's still on the plane. (sighs) He'll make it. His phone battery probably just died. Oh, God. You don't understand, okay? The phone is ringing, he's just not answering. I'm sorry. He'll make it. Oh, shit, Micky. What am I gonna do? He'll make it. (bells tolling) Adriana: Shit! Shit. (crying) He's not answering. I'm sorry. What am I going to do? Marry Stefano. - Are you kidding me? - Just do it. Papa wants you to. You love him. Adriana, Stefano will never marry me. This is insane. Do it! Everyone is coming. Duffy... he didn't show up. He blew you off. If you show up with Stefano, people will embrace it. You know they will. They want you to marry him. What about his family and friends coming to the wedding? - His parents... - How many of his friends are coming? - How many? - I don't know, like 10 maybe. Oh, okay. And how many are coming for you? - Do it. - Oh, God. Do it! (screams) No! You know what? - I'm just calling it off. - Are you kidding? - No. - You can't call it off. You cannot call it off. Papa will kill you. (rock music playing) # Something in your eyes # # Tonight # # Something that says # # You'll give it away # # You don't need any reasons... # Dude, it was right there, man. (laughing) We did it. - (laughs) - We made it, bro. So stoked. Dude, that beast is nice. Duffy: Who needs a red-eye flight? Hey, do you have any mouthwash? Uh, no. Why? You're good, right? My mouth tastes like a used sporting goods store. It's probably 'cause you had that Chinese ball-gag in your mouth all night. - That's a good point. - You always were a slow dresser, man. Don't hold us up. This is your wedding. You were always a fast undresser, buddy. Dude, you been working out? Those pecs are looking really ripe. Thanks, bro. - (buckle jangling) - Was I snoring? I don't know. I was asleep too. - What?! - I mean, uh, yeah. You were really loud. - I turned the radio up. - You didn't wear your contacts today? I mean, I'm driving. Why would I wear contacts? - Exactly. - Then I've gotta see better. Dude, those bridesmaids better be gorgeous. I heard Italian chicks suck good dick. Well, they're all rich. They're good cooks and they have fat asses. I should be the one getting married anyway. Look at me. I look better than you in that. Come here. Do ya? Yeah, straighten that up a little bit. - Okay. - Eyebrows? - Fix my eyebrows up. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that looks good. Don't you think? (choir vocalizing) (Adriana sniffling) (grunts) (crying) (rock music playing) # I've been coming # # I've been coming after you # # You got me coming out # # You got me coming right after you # # Uh-oh, uh-oh... # Shit. Come on. Adriana! - God damn it. - Father: Adriana! - Adriana. - Stop calling him. I don't understand it. It just keeps ringing. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. - Tell him. Tell him. - No! No! Papa, everything's going to be okay. Duffy's on his way. There's just something wrong with his phone. - He dumped you. - No, Michela. Okay? No, Papa. He's on his way, okay? He'll be here. Marry Stefano, my love. - Adriana: No, Papa! - Just do it, Adriana. You know you like him. - Go ahead and marry him. - Adriana, listen to your sister. He's here. He wants to speak to you. Papa, Jesus. - Adriana. - Hello, Stefano. Look, I'm here for you. Mm, thank you, but I don't need you. Duffy's coming, okay? Well, I'll wait until the very last minute. I'm dressed and ready to be your husband, so if you decide you want to marry me today, I'd be honored to do so. (gasps) Thanks, um, I really appreciate it, but that's just not necessary because Duffy's on his way. - Well, I'm here for you. - Mm. Adriana, you should consider Stefano's offer. He's a good man. He'll be a good husband. Duffy, he doesn't show up at the wedding. He's not here and we're ready, so... No, Papa. He's coming. - I hope so. - Yeah. I hope so, but Stefano is here and we're ready. It's time. It's time. L... I think he'll be good for the family, good for the company, he'll be a good husband for you and I approve of him. - I approve of him. - Yeah. I know. I know, Papa. (sighs) (grunting) - I hate you, Duffy! - (laughing) - (chattering) - Shut up! I can't believe it. I'm so nervous. I'm not nervous. Shh. You look great, man. Dude, you are getting married. I'm so proud of you, man. I know I gave you a hard time for this, but you're doing the right thing, man. - Think she'll forgive me? - Does she love you? - She loves me. - Than she'll forgive you. Go make a wife out of her, man. (laughs) (silent) (murmuring) Great job there, son. We want to thank you for inviting us to your wedding. You are welcome. How was it? Duffy, you really screwed the pooch on this one, honey. Okay, Mom, it was not my fault. - Well... - Son... son, listen. We're gonna go down to the city and we're gonna find ourselves a nice show to go to and then we're going to find a nice little bar - where we can get stinking drunk. - That's for sure. And then we're going to go back to our nice little hotel room and pass out. Tomorrow morning, we may be a little hung-over, but we're going to go to a nice breakfast and then we're going to maybe go shopping. - Maybe. - And then we are going to leave. So, if you'd like to come out to the house some time and tell us what this was all about, that'd be great because right now, we are just flat batshit confused. Oh, you just really screwed things up here, honey. You really screwed the pooch and I am really pissed at you. - I am really pissed at you, Duffy... - He knows, honey. (mother stammering) I'll... I'll email you. Michela, what happened? Duffy, you screwed up my life. Hi, Duffy. Hi, Beverly. (rock music playing) (rock music playing) Kelly: I love you so much, Duffy. Thanks so much for this vacation. It's amazing. You are so welcome. Thanks for coming. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your wedding. But it all turned out for the best, right? (sighs) Definitely did. Let's just, uh... let's relax, okay? I mean... I'm better than that stupid foreign rich bitch, anyway. So much better. We've always had fun, haven't we, Duffy? More fun than I can handle. And our sex is amazing. Actually, yeah, it's... it's the best I've ever had. - (laughs) - You like that? It's so... Are you hungry? Um... yeah. - Okay. - Let's go eat. Good. (rock music playing) # I've got a Cisco feeling # # I've got a summer feeling... # Hey Duffy, didn't you say you used to come here with Adriana all the time? Yeah, it was our favorite place. - How was that? - Man: It was good, it was good. - You want some? - Mm-mm. - No? Baby. - Adriana: Mm-mm. Hey. (gasps) Duff. - What happened? - Hey, it's Princess Charming. Duffy, come on, let's go. Let's not make a scene, okay? Hey, princess, can you go tickle your toes down to the beach? Shut your face, Stefano. No one... no one wants you here in the first place, okay? - Adriana: Okay... - No, listen. This guy, he locked me up in the frat house. I couldn't make the plane - to get to the wedding. - You know what? I don't want to hear it. Okay? It's too late. - He locked me up. - Oh, yeah? He locked you up? You know what? He told me everything. Okay? He locked you in a sex dungeon... the sex dungeon that you were already in. No, it wasn't... it wasn't a sex dungeon. - Okay, explain. Do. Please. - It was a frat house... - sex dungeon, but it... - And who was there, hmm? A lot of people like this guy. And who else, hmm? Who else was there, huh? Like maybe who you're with right now? Huh? You're so predictable, Duffy. Give me a break. Oh, excuse me for a second. Hey, Kell. What's up? Hey, Adriana. Always a pleasure. - Yeah. - Yeah, princess, I think it's time for you two to go home. Why do you keep calling me "princess"? Stefano: Why? 'Cause you came out of the womb as a woman, that's why. - That's 'cause you have a crush on me. - Stefano: Why don't you guys - go to the beach and braid your hair? - Why don't you go wax your chest again? You're lucky I'm... you're a short little tiny man. 'Cause if you weren't, I would come over there and punch you in your nipple. - Father: Boys! Boys! - (all chattering) Adriana: Just stop it now. Enough. This guy? Adriana, I love you. Duff, come on. Stop. It's too late. All right? Duffy, you're an asshole. (chuckling) It's always been you, Adriana. I love you. - I love you. - You know what, Duffy? Screw you. You're a dick. What are you looking at? Just go run after Kelly, okay? Just go, all right? You know what? I'm... not in love with you anymore. Wow. (soft rock music playing) Fuck! Hey. # As the moments passed us by # # Somewhere along the way # # We lost sight # # Of the important things in life # # Like time # # And "I love yous" # # Seem to settle # # Around goodbyes # # So what were you supposed to be # # When you grew up? # # As your life in scenes, it flashes # # Right before your eyes # # 'Cause there are # # No heroes # # And this is your life # # This is what's wrong # # You're the big fish # # In the small pond # # And this is your world # # It's where you belong # # Inside, you are hollow # # The damage is done # # And this is your world # # Before we fade away # # Before we fade away... # - (chatting) - Father: That's a good thing. - Stefano: It is. - Stefano? - Yeah? - Let me go talk to Duffy. What? I'll be fine, okay? I just want to, I don't know, talk to him and help him get back together with Kelly and just tell him it's over for good. - I mean, look at him. - Okay. He's just sitting there all by himself. I feel so bad, you know? Why don't you go over there and tell that little princess that it's over, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Hey, Adriana, do you know how long it's gonna be? I'm just gonna go talk to him and get him back with Kell, so give me a couple hours at least. Father: Adriana, you make him understand it's over for good. You set him straight. - Okay. - Father: Okay. Ciao. (soft rock music playing) # The damage is done # # And this is your world # # Before we fade away... # - Hey. - # Before we fade away... # Would you please just tell me what happened? You screwed me over real bad, that's what happened. I didn't want to. - (gasps) - Okay? I wanted... I want to marry you. But there were all these problems at the party. There was like rooms and handcuffs and... and there was the plane and the car... - Jesse Jane... - What?! I don't want to hear about this, okay? No. It doesn't matter anymore. It's over. Over? But I love you. Does that not mean anything to you? (groans) You need to go find Kelly. Where did she go, anyway? I don't care, all right? Don't you think it's fate that we're both here at the same time? Come on! I'm here because my family comes here. Remember? That's why we used to come here... my family. Remember? You were going to be a part of my family? Are you kidding me? - (gasps) - Okay, what are we gonna do? Go our separate ways. That's retarded.
