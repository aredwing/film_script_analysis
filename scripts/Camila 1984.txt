There she is. - Look at all the soldiers! - Are those so she won't escape? Why would Perichona want to escape? I already told you not to call her Perichona! Everyone else calls her that! It doesn't matter. She's your grandmother, you have to respect her. Mom, why is she locked in? Is she a spy? What's a spy? Welcome, madame. I hope your stay here will be as pleasant as possible. Pleasant! Knowing that I'll have to spend the rest of my life in this ranch! - Are you joking? - Be glad you're not in jail. And be thankful for the authorities' generosity. I'm your mother, Adolfo. I beg you not to forget that. I don't know you. You were born when I was in Janeiro. What's your name? Camila, grandma. Camila O'Gorman. Very nice. Tell me, do you like love stories? I don't know. The newspaper! Gazeta Mercantil! It's the other way around, you ignorant nigger! Here, hurry up. The master's waiting. Rita! Tell child Camila to come, her teacher's waiting for her! She's not in her room, Mrs. Joaquina. Child Eduardo, did you see child Camila? - No. - The master's asking for her. She must not want to take a bath. The English have surrendered. They understood Rosas won't be bought. - They had to stop the blockage. - Is that good, master? Of course. Now we'll have good candles. Girls! Don't play with water! I have so much work on bath day! Rita, is it true the governor takes baths every day? - Don't say those things! - Is it true or not? So they say. The man is a bit eccentric. It seems... Of course he has a big and a small house. That way anyone can have tons of water. Camila, always hiding! Why don't you say where you go? What for? So Tita can hear about it and send me to drown? Look. IN MEMORY OF CAMILA O'GORMAN AND LADISLAO GUTIERREZ FREE VERSION 1984 I have no solution. I fought with my dad again. He's so overpowering. Sometimes I want him to die. And then I have ugly dreams. Last night I heard meows, I didn't know where they came from. I dreamt that I opened a door and I saw a man and a woman and she was breathing like a cat does. Father... I couldn't stop watching. I couldn't stop watching. It was stronger than me. I got closer and looked. When I saw that woman naked and on the floor, that was me. I'm so embarrassed, Father. You know dreams don't come from nothing. They're born in the heart. - Father Felix? - I'm not Father Felix. But I thought I was talking to the confessor! - Why did you let me go on. - We both have the same mission. I don't want to go on confessing myself to you. Excuse me, Father. Who's the new Father? Water! Water! What do you have for me today, Mariano? - It just got here from Montevideo. - Thanks. So long! - Hi, Toms. - Hi, Camila. - How are you, Miss Hortencia? - Hello. - Will you write it down? - Yes. - Mariano, Mariano? - Yes? How much is it today for child Camila? - Eight. - Eight. Don't tell me you're here to but books, because I don't believe you. - No. - So you're following me. I don't want you to be seen around here. Give me that package. Give me that package. It's not black powder. It's a book. Yes, but there are books and then there's books. - Come on. - Ignacio... I'm just trying to protect you. That's all. Well. Then walk me home. Let's go. Carmen! Carmen, I'm going home with Ignacio. Alone? "There's nothing sadder than emigrating". "Leaving your country with violence without wanting... ...or thinking about it is a torment which no one... ...can feel unless they experienced it themselves". "Emigrating is death". How long will you keep tormenting me? I'm reading for you, Echeverria. You didn't listen, did you? I mean it. Let's leave the books. Camila, Camilita! Beautiful princess, will you marry me? Come over, come over... Ignacio! You won't be able to recognize him, he's just arrived! I bet I can! He's not Father Felix. Eduardo isn't either. Please, speak. Say something. - Happy birthday, Camila. - I know who it is. It's the province Father. Supper's ready! Camila, let's cut the cake! There's my father. Father, I want you to meet my friend from Tucumn. - Father Ladislao Gutierrez. - They told me about you. - Father Ganon. - Nice to meet you. My uncle the governor has told me to transmit his greetings. Excuse me. Your uncle is the governor of Tucumn? That's right, sir. Remember the doors to this house will always be open for you. Father Gutierrez, it's not a small offer. With Mr. O'Gorman you can find the best of Buenos Aires. And I'm grateful, sir. You'll have to take care of the details. - I don't understand, Father. - You have forgotten your token. I always carry an extra one for this emergencies. The governor is a bit too careful about this matter. Father Ganon likes to exaggerate. Do you think I exaggerate? - Excuse me. - Here, give some to Clara. How nice, great recipe! - Tomorrow if you like. - Sure. Do you want a drink? "My dear madam". "I hear how they prepare the weapons outside... which they'll shoot against this heart, which I want you to know will be with you... until their last beat". No, no, not that one. That one's for me. I'll give you another one. "Because my passion, dear madam, doesn't know about the limits of time". "Now and then I touch this cross which still holds... the smell of your body, which I love madly". Is it true you made love like in the soap operas? Yes. We didn't sleep all night long. The viceroy never forgets about the pleasure of her lover. Never. My whole body aches. But go on, love letters wilt when they're not read again. "Your angelical body vibrates in my arms... even when I don't have you anymore". Mon Dieu! It's time! And I'm not dressed! Listen, listen! The guests are arriving! Yes, madam. But remember the viceroy is always the last to arrive! - My hat. - Yes. My hat and... downstairs? Is everything ready downstairs? - Yes. - Are the musicians here? - Yes, madam. - Are you sure the table's set? Yes, madam. I myself laid the candlesticks you ordered me too. And the jasmines. Can you hear, madam O'Gorman? They're playing a minuet! How many times do I have to tell you how much I dislike... you coming up here? I'm sorry, Tatita. You know this lady is confined. Or don't you? - Yes, but she's my grandmother. - Obey and hurry up. We'll go back to Buenos Aires before it gets dark. You look beautiful, my madam. What are you waiting for to receive Santiago de Liniers? He's about to arrive. Don't worry, madam. Don't worry. No one will arrive. They're all dead. Liniers was shot over 30 years ago. My dear son... Go to sleep, tomorrow mommy will tell you... all about the party. Will you kiss me? Goodbye, mother. I'll be back for Christmas. Take care of yourself. You know, I'll be so sad when you get married. Sometimes I think I never will. That the man I imagine is only a dream. Look, child, I'm watching you. All dressed in white. Going into the church with the master. Rita! - Long live the federation! - Long live! Again? Like when we were kids! How long, my God...? What is it? - You can't come in. - What's going on here? - Let me go through. - You can't come in, sir. I'm here to bring the papers for our wedding. My God! Who is he? - Mariano. - The horror... - What wrong can a bookman do? - You never know. As Rosas say, avoid shedding 20 thousand. Why do you leave him there, Father? Please, do something! We can't touch him yet. Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Then, my dear brothers, let's prepare our hearts... for the Christmas coming. Thinking about its deep meaning I must ask myself... What happened the other night at the house of God? Has Herodes laid Bautista's head again in the bloody plate? If some come to destroy and kill, He come for you to have life. And so you have it in abundance. "I'm the good shepherd", He said. And a good shepherd gives life to his sheep. The Father wants not to lose not even one of them, as wicked as it may seem, not even one of them! Where does this pain come from now then? One of our brothers has been brutally deprived from his life. And I truly say, as the Lord said, that what you do to the smallest of my brothers... ...you do to me. It's time to know all kingdom divided against itself won't last. That all divided household will be isolated. Brothers, let's not fear. This is the word of God. There's not law that can silence this word. Let's join in prayer. "Blessed are the meek..." Blessed are the meek... "Blessed are those who thirst and hunger for justice... because they will be satisfied". That happens when you put young priests. What can he know about the 1820's? Nothing. I find it strange because of where he's coming from. A federal family. His uncle's governor. He's stubborn. Doesn't he know who stopped the foreign invasion? Rosas did. Who got order and law back? Rosas did. Who defends our sovereignty? Rosas does. Just Rosas. At any cost. What did you say, Camila? Nothing, nothing. That's fine, you can leave. Repeat what you said, Camila. Nothing justifies violence. Unitarians vs. Federals, Federals vs. Unitarians. - All my life I heard the same. - But it's not the same. I'm not so sure. What was poor Mariano guilty of? Selling books! Eat, Camila. Shut up and listen. I think Camila wants to defend her new confessor. Yes. Is it wrong to want to defend someone with the courage... to be on life's side? You must be brave to say what he said? Camila, no one raises their voice in this table. Leave. Buenos Aires is a violent city. I'm sure he just wanted to protect you. - Then I must shut up, shouldn't I? - No, you must be more careful. That's what I mean. What's so funny? The way you find it to tell me you don't disapprove. - Is that what I did? - Yes. You put my thoughts in order, Father. Just like a compass. I feel good after talking to you. That's what priests are for. I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't talk to you... about my sorrows. - And your sins. - Yes, my sins. This is a confessional, let's not forget about that. I don't. I'll have to invent many sins. Your sermon, Father Gutierrez, has been an unpleasant surprise. Do I need to remind you about our weak relations... with the government? Don't you know they're trying to expel the Jesuits? I'm sorry, Father. Maybe I was led by indignation. You, who love quoting the Bible, have forgotten what Jesus... said to his disciples. "Since I'm sending you like sheep amongst wolves... be as prudent as snakes and simple as doves". Not being prudent as a priest is twice as dangerous. In any land. I don't understand, Father. Don't forget women can be an instrument of the Devil. - Father Ladislao! - Hello, Camila. I didn't see you. Father, I brought this for the people who may need more than me. I'm sure you know. Do you really think this can help the poor? Why don't you try to put yourself in their place, Camila. Beggars don't dress as rich women. You don't need to humiliate me. I'm just trying to be better. A single woman's a chaos, Camila. A nature's disorder. To submit that anarchy there are only two ways: The convent... ...or matrimony. And I don't think you have the habit calling. Marriage is order. Nor people nor a country can live without order. - I'm not in love with Ignacio. - What's that got to do? Love comes with the years and not looking between flowers. You have filled your head with those foreign books. Reality is not a French novel. - Sir... - I told you no people today! Father Gutierrez is here, sir. Bah, let him in. - Good evening, sir. - What brings you here at this time? I came to talk to Eduardo. Eduardo is at his cousin's. Would you like a cup of chocolate, Father? No, thanks, Joaquina. I'll leave then. If you'll excuse me. Here, Camila. This was amongst the clothes you brought to Church. Keep it, Father. Maybe this will be good enough for your poor people. They'll thank you the same way they thanked your dresses. Did they? I thank you too. Your words make me very happy. Good evening. - Where were we? - Marriage is like the country. The best jail is that one which you don't see. I didn't say that! I said women should get married, that's all! Same thing. Camila, I'm not over. You never thought about a woman? - Yes, sometimes. - And? What would you do if you fell in love? What would a priest do? - I'd punish my body without mercy. - What? Your body can turn against you. And if that didn't relieve me I'd try to get away... from that woman and never see her again. - What if that didn't work either? - It has to work! Camila... Human love has its limitation. Only God's love is endless. - But if he regrets being a priest? - He can't regret! - Marriage to God is forever! - Eduardo, you can't say that. - Yes, I can. - No. - You won't understand. - No. Listen. "On Northern days an insect is born at 9 a.m... and dies at 5 p.m." "How can it understand the word "night"? How can you understand the word "love"... if you were never in love? Let's pray. Come in. Father Felix. I'd like to confess. - At this time? - Please. Camila... I have a boyfriend. I do! I have a boyfriend! I have a boyfriend! Jose Maria has declared his love. They'll get married! The one in the Restorer's Society? I know he's not famous, but he is distinguished! And very rich. Excuse me, Clarita. I didn't mean to offend you. - I hope you love him. - Of course I love him. - I'm marrying him. - That's what's important. Love each other very much. Very, very much. I'll only have these two empty beds. Marry Ignacio. What are you waiting for? Someone else to get him? You're so dumb, Camila. You'll miss the best catch in Buenos Aires. I want something else, Clara. I want someone different. Someone... ...who I can feel proud of. Yes. Proud, someone I can... Go out on the streets, shout his name and say... "This is my husband". And shout it out loud! What a dumb. Father Ladislao... Father Ladislao... Yes, my child. I hear you, Camila. I'm dead in love, Father. That's not a sin. It's natural at your age. I love him with all my heart. I'd do anything for him. You should think about getting married then, child. He can't be married. And I'm not your child. What are you saying, Camila? Can't you see who I'm talking about? Why won't you understand? Camila, I don't want to listen. - Please, Father. - This is the House of God. Please. - What's wrong, Rita? - Mrs. Camila... grandma's dead. My God, oh, my God... Where's Father Gutierrez? Wasn't he coming? No, he's ill and has a fever. Hail Mary, mother of God... - Good morning, Father Felix. - Good morning, my son. Ladislao... This letter was left for you while you were at mass. When I hear the bells ring it's like you're speaking to me. I wanted to know this place. You're crazy, Camila. Yes. - What will I do with you? - Whatever you want. What will God do with us? If you love me, I don't care. I'm no good at secret love, Camila. Me neither. - This can only mean scandal. - I'm not afraid of anything. Please, leave. At your command. It's me again. I needed to hear your voice. My Camila. I'm crazy. I can't stop thinking about you. I dream about you day and night. I can't sleep. Camila... I love you. I'd spend my life kneeling before you. Didn't you take a nap, Camila. I got you something. What? A gift. So you'll always remember me. Love me very much, mom. Love me very much. So you decided to come. Take. Let's have something fresh. You must be thirsty. Father, I have something to tell you. Say it. Father... What is it, son? Why are you being so mysterious? Camila left. What are you saying? What the fuck are you saying? That Camila left. We looked everywhere for her. Did you? Who did you look for? Camila and Father Ladislao. They left together, Father. No bird moves in the Pampas without the governor knowing. And the scandal ends right here, in front of our very noses. Write down. "Dear governor..." "We pray you order the Chief of police... to look in all the city and the country... so that in any part of the land where they are found, these miserable, unhappy, bastards... will be caught, and brought here". "To raise to your knowledge... ...the most atrocious act... ...ever heard of in the country". Please, Adolfo. We should hear from Camila before we condemn her. Break that letter. I beg you. What are you saying? She's sleeping like a whore with a priest... ...and you want explanations! First my mother. Now, her. She's your daughter, father. Have mercy. These aren't times of mercy! What a shame, poor mother! It will only be harmful for the Church... ...if we didn't punish this act... ...to satisfy religion and the laws. And the prevent with healthy rectitude the demoralization, the immorality and disorder." "Signed General Don Juan Manuel de Rosas" "Governor and First Captain of the Province". I was born in Los Talas, province of Jujuy. My father is Clemente de Sal, my mother is Josefa Gmez. Where did you get married? I got married on Capilla San Jos in La Rioja province... on may 2, 1846. - Where did we go on our honeymoon? - Nowhere, we're poor. Let's make something up, that's not expensive. You choose. Rome. Yes... So you ask the Pope permission to marry me. It would be nice, wouldn't it? - Camila... - Valentina. Valentina. Maximo Brandier's happy wife. - Really happy? - Yes. Sometimes I feel like crying. It would be better if we were old and remembered and told. - Are you that afraid? - Very much. You weren't born to hide. You were born to love. To love you. This is the... - Sun! - Very good! Very good. What's this? Banana! No! It's the moon! M, O, O, N. It comes out at nights, when the sun's not around. - Go home. - Great! Slowly, give me your handbooks and your boards. - See you tomorrow! - See you tomorrow. - Good morning, commander. - Good morning. - You're always working! - Yes, always. These are some candy, from my wife. - Thanks. - You're always nice to us. Fine... life is hard in Corrientes. Even for those in love. Do you want to come in and have some mate? No, I have very little time. Some other day. See you on Easter. Don't forget I'll wait for you at home. We're very little in Goya. Let's not be rude. Count on us. We'll be there. Very good. See you Sunday. Goodbye, thanks. - It's starting to get cold, isn't it? - Yes, summer's over. - Camila... - Ladislao... SCHOOL - You can't sleep. - No. I need to be alone. Please. I need you to be with me. Do you think that what I did was little to be with you? - You're regretting. - Camila, please. - Answer. - I was praying. - You didn't answer me. - Won't you leave me alone? If I had a child with you that would be a sign... that God isn't angry at us, wouldn't it? Yes, my child. Yes. If He was mad, He'd be wrong. - Did I say a blasphemy? - I don't know. I don't know. Do you know what I'd like to do? - Confess with you. - Camila, shut up. Confess... ...that when I see you pray... ...I'm jealous. Camila, if I hear you I no longer know who I am. My husband. Mximo Brandier. Do you know something, Mr. Brandier? - What, my madam? - I'm so proud to be your wife. Do you know what else, Mrs. Valentina? I love you. - Good evening. - Good evening, commander. Very nice to meet you. PRIEST LADISLAO GUTIERREZ CAMILA O'GORMAN Thanks. - Do you want some? - Thanks. You go to the kitchen. I'll come later. - Thanks. - How are you, judge? Hi. Excuse me. Don Maximo, if you allow me and so does... what I've drunk I want to raise my glad in honor... of your charming wife. Besides I wanted to thank you for being... our children's first teachers. That won't be forgotten by the city of Goya. Thank you, Mr. Judge. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mrs. Valentina... I'm here to steal your husband. Just a while. It's a man's issue. He gets on the front to hit him with those paws. With his beak. They take their eyes out. Look! Look at them stand. They're good! That's the favorite one. He's the child of one that never lost a feather. Look at him stand up! He's strong! How are you, Father Gutierrez? - What did you say? - Don't you remember me? Father Ladislao Gutierrez? You must be confused. The arm of God gets everywhere. How long did you intend to run away? He doesn't forget those He chose. It's not a coincidence that I should be here, in this lost little town. Why don't you let me live in peace? What is it? Where's my husband? Father Gutierrez has been discovered. I'm sorry, madam. I don't understand what you're talking about. Another priest recognized him. I still don't understand. Where's Mximo? Camila! Please... Where is he? I don't know. He ran to the river. At your doorstep... ...you'll find two horses with groceries on them. Brazil isn't far away. Don't waste any time. Dawn is near and then I'll have to obey my uniform. Thanks. I will always be Gutierrez. I'm sorry. I wanted it so. I don't regret anything. Me neither. But... I can't with Him. I can't with Him. On behalf of the government of Corrientes the lawless... Ladislao Gutierrez and Camila O'Gorman... are arrested and put to the order of justice. What are you saying? No! Not her! Not her! Let her go! She didn't do anything! She didn't do anything! Let her go! - Ladislao! - Not her! "To such corruption has order arrived under the tyranny... of Plata's Caligula that the priests of Buenos Aires ran away... with the girls of the best society without this immoral man... take any action of it." "El Mercurio", Santiago de Chile. What do you think now? What should Rosas do? - Tell them they're right? - She's a girl, doctor. Not anymore. Not anymore. Let's read. This is from Montevideo. "Is there enough punishment for a man who dishonors a woman... and cannot repair it by marrying her?" Valentn Alsina. What's important is knowing if there are laws... which contemplate the case. Do you think Sarmiento and Alsina care about the law? They don't ask for trials, they ask for punishment! Did you read anything about a trial? Excuse me, Father Elortondo. I don't think the Church can be so naive. You're excused, Dr. Velez. But the governor asks for your juridical advice. Well. No problem at all. According to the amendments this is a sacrilege. It's punished with the death penalty. Is it prudent to evoke the laws of Indians... when not even in Spain they punish sacrilege with death? All that matters is shutting up those filthy Unitarians! Would you like to add anything else to defend your future... ...sister-in-law? She won't be my sister-in-law. I'll call off the wedding. Sir... Camila's in jail in Santos Lugares. - How do you know? - My father told me. Don Adolfo, please, you must defend her. No one gets out of there alive. My God... I trusted you with my daughter. And you weren't man enough to take care of her. You must be a bigger man to learn to forgive, sir. A daughter who betrays her father doesn't deserve forgiveness! If Camila comes back she'll regret all the damage she's done. I'm begging you, Adolfo. - Please, Tatita... - No more wining! She doesn't regret it. I know. It's in her blood. She's just like my mother. Do you want me to tell you one thing, Adolfo O'Gorman? Damn the day I met you! Instead of thinking about your daughter... all you care about is your last name! You're sick with pride! You're all sick! With violence! With blood! Does anybody raise his voice to save my daughter? No one! No one thinks about her! The Church thinks about its good name. You think about your honor. Rosas, about his power. The Unitarians on how to overthrow him... by using this scandal! But who thinks about my daughter? They'll shoot me. What about Camila? Forget everything, think about yourself. It's a service I ask of you so I can die in peace. Camila will also die. I need to talk to her. - You're the boss here. - I'm not any boss, Father. I just execute orders. - I'm begging you, Captain. - Don't insist. Don't insist. Will they kill us just like that? No trial even? - No chance to defend ourselves? - It's not in my hands. You told me they'd send me to the exercise house! Somehow the governor changed his mind. They can't kill us like this! Get a doctor, urgently! My child, you're pregnant. May God help you! Ladislao! We're having a baby! We're having a baby! Ladislao! We're having a baby! We saved her, Mariano! We saved her! We saved her, Mariano! We saved her! How? The law forbids to kill a pregnant woman. Sit down, doctor. - Long live the Federation! - Long live! Come in. - Long live the Federation. - Long live. What is it? I come from Buenos Aires. A message from the governor. How long will it be? Four hours. What about Camila? Will she die at the same time? Yes. I need to write some lines. Please... Camila, my dear. I just learnt you'll die with me. Since we couldn't live together on Earth... we'll join each other in Heaven before God. I embrace you, your Gutierrez. Be brave, my child. God wants you on His side. Please, Father... do something, I beg you. Confess your sins to me, dear. You must be ready for the supreme moment. But won't you understand? There's life in me! Make it safe, I beg you! - Think about your other life. - But I think about this one! Drink, my child, so that the blessed water... reaches the body of the innocent. Be brave, my child. Attention, company! March! Attention, shooting squad! Line up! Attention, shooting squad! Present weapons! - Ladislao, are you there? - Right next to you, Camila. Arms to the shoulder! Aim! Fire! Ladislao! Ladislao... Attention, shooting squad! Load weapons! Arms to the shoulder! Aim! Fire! Fire! I said fire! Fire! Ladislao, are you there? Right next to you, Camila.
