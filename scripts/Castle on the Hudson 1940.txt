YEAH, I' M AFRAID THAT' S IT. YOU CERTAINLY PLAY A SWELL GAME, FATHER. Warden: YOU' RE IN GOOD SHAPE, GORDAN. I WAS NEVER IN BETTER SHAPE IN MY LIFE. I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR SOUL, TOO, TOM. AH, NO, NOT A CHANCE. I DON' T GO IN FOR THAT PEARLY GATE STUFF. IT' S ALL RIGHT FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUT I DON' T WANT ANY. MAYBE IT' LL COME TO YOU LATER ON. IF IT DOES, I' LL TELL YOU WHAT I' LL DO. YOU CAN HAVE ALL MY BUSINESS. THANKS FOR THE GAME, FATHER. LET' S TRY AND GET ANOTHER ONE IN BEFORE I GO, HUH? I, UH, AIN' T GO SO LONG, YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT. I WILL. GOOD-BYE. SO LONG. MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU. YOU GUYS GET TIRED OF LOCKING AND UNLOCKING DOORS? SURE. I WONDER--IF THEY TAKE HALF OF THEM OUT, YOU COULD CUT DOWN ON YOUR WORKING HOURS. SO THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL THE DANCE HALL, HUH? YEAH. NICE PLACE. I DON' T KNOW WHY YOU KEPT ME AWAY FROM HERE SO LONG. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WOULDN' T MIND STAYING HERE FOR A WHILE. SAY, IS THIS THE PLACE I GO OUT? THAT' S RIGHT, GORDAN. HOW MUCH LONGER HAVE I GOT? TILL 11:00 TONIGHT. OH, THAT GIVES ME PLENTY OF TIME. "ALMIGHTY GOD, WHO HAS GIVEN US GRACE AT THIS TIME, "WITH ONE ACCORD WE MAKE OUR COMMON SUPPLICATION UNTO THEE; "DOST PROMISE THAT WHEN TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER IN THY NAME, "THOU WILT GRAN THEIR REQUESTS. FULFILL NOW, O LORD..." [DOOR OPENING] HEY, GUARD, WHAT TIME IS IT? 12 MINUTES TO 11:00. THANKS. [DOOR OPENING] TOMMY, TOMMY. THEY WOULDN' BELIEVE ME, TOMMY. I SWORE A HUNDRED TIMES I DID IT. YOU KNOW THAT, DON' T YOU? I KNOW, HONEY. I KNOW YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD. TOMMY, YOU KNOW I' M TELLING THE TRUTH. WARDEN, I KILLED HIM. I--I KILLED HIM. WHY CAN' T THEY BELIEVE ME? KAY, THAT' S NO USE NOW. THEY KNEW I WAS THERE, AND THEY KNEW I' D KILL HIM. BUT YOU DIDN' T. I LIED. HALF OF IT WAS A LIE. TOMMY WAS THERE WHEN CROWLEY CAME IN, JUST LIKE THE COPPER TESTIFIED. THEY WERE FIGHTING, AND CROWLEY WAS KILLING HIM. I HAD THE GUN, AND I SHOT HIM. TOMMY TOOK THE GUN AWAY FROM ME AND BEAT IT DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE. THAT' S THE TRUTH! YOU' VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME! TOMMY, TOMMY, WHY DON' T YOU TELL HIM THAT' S THE TRUTH BEFORE IT' S TOO LATE? KAY, HONEY, KAY, BABY, TAKE IT EASY. LOOK, KAY, THAT' S NO WAY TO ACT. WARDEN, YOU KNOW THAT AIN' T THE TRUTH. SHE' S JUST TRYING TO CLEAR ME. THAT' S ALL. YEAH, I TOLD YOU SHE WAS A CHAMPION. YES. YEAH, AND THAT' S THAT, SEE, AND THERE' S NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT. NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME. YOU SAY YOU DID IT. ALL RIGHT. SUPPOSE THEY BELIEVE YOU. THEN WHAT? THEY' LL SEND YOU UP THE RIVER FOR LIFE. AND WHAT HAPPENS TO ME? I' LL STILL HAVE TO DO MY STRETCH FROM 5 TO 30. DON' T YOU SEE, HONEY? WE COULD NEVER BE TOGETHER, ANYWAY. KAY, THIS IS A CHANCE FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING DECENT IN MY LIFE. YOU CAN' T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME. I LOVE YOU, KID. OH, TOMMY, I CAN' T LE THEM HURT YOU-- THAT' S ALL THERE IS TO IT. WILL YOU DO ONE THING FOR ME, TOMMY? YOU KNOW I WILL, HONEY. WILL YOU--WILL YOU MARRY ME BEFORE-- MARRY YOU?! KAY, HONEY, WHY DO YOU WANT TO WISH THAT ON YOURSELF, BABY? BEING MARRIED TO A GUY THAT WENT TO THE CHAIR WOULD MARK YOU FOR LIFE. I DON' T CARE. YOU WERE ALL RIGH UNTIL YOU MET ME. I GOT YOU INTO ALL THIS TROUBLE. FORGET ME NOW. GO OUT AND GRAB YOURSELF A SQUARE GUY, A GUY WHO WORKS FOR A LIVING, GIVE YOU SOME HAPPINESS, A HOME, AND KIDS, AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. NO. I DON' T WAN ANYONE BUT YOU. I BELONG TO THE STATE OF NEW YORK, SEE, AND IN A FEW MINUTES, THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS GONNA TAKE ME OUT AND BURN ME, UNDERSTAND? OH, TOMMY, DON' T SAY THAT! I DONE ENOUGH TO YOU WHILE I WAS ALIVE. THERE' S NO USE YOUR CARRYING ME WITH YOU TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GRAVE. OH, TOMMY! KAY. TOMMY! [SOBBING] KAY. KAY. KAY, HONEY, YOU GOTTA GO NOW. LET' S JUST REMEMBER THE SWELL TIMES WE HAD TOGETHER, AND-- AND REMEMBER, KID, I LOVED YOU MORE THAN-- I KNOW, TOMMY. MORE THAN LIFE. [SOBBING] TIME IS UP. "FATHER OF MERCY AND GOD OF ALL COMFORT, "WHO BELIEVETH AND TRUSTETH IN THEE, ACCORDING TO THE MULTITUDE OF THY TENDER MERCIES--" THAT' S ENOUGH, FATHER. I DON' T NEED ANY MORE. JUST WALK ALONG WITH ME, WILL YOU? ALL RIGHT, TOMMY. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? YEAH. YOU CAN GIVE ME A LIGHT. [DOOR OPENS] READY? YES.
