You've been on my ass since the start of this trip. I got it! You're the guy with the car, shit! Oh, Astrid, take my seat over here. Eko, don't be like that, please. Saved by the bell, dude. Where's the mike? Let's crash this place! How's Ladya? More complicated than I thought. Then let me talk to her; she's practically a sister to me. Okay... I'll go talk to her now. Ladya... This is what mom and dad left us. I'll send for more. What's this for, Adjie? I don't need money. You don't need to live like this. I'll take care of everything. You could live at mom and dad's house. And if you want to, get back to college. You're here to rescue me now? I'm happy with the way things are. They've accepted me over in Australia. We'll be flying out tomorrow. I wanted to say goodbye. You came all the way over here just to tell me that? Astrid called me about this, - so there was no need for you to. - Ladya, please! Can't we just talk? Like the old days? Listen, Adjie... Every time I see you... I think back to mom and dad, their accident... What could I do? They wouldn't have caught that taxi, had it not been for you! - Take good care of Astrid now... - Ladya! Hey, where's our dessert? I'm sorry, we don't serve what you've requested. Then why don't you be our dessert, sweetie? Careful: your boyfriend might get jealous. She just called you a homo! Wait a minute. What's with you? Never tasted a man's touch? - Bitch! - You alright? - I'm okay. You and me, outside. Just so you know... you'll be a dead man. Shithead! That's so typical of you, Alam. If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead now! Now what's your excuse?! I should fire you! - Sir, allow me. - Who's this now? Customer's safety should... have been your responsibility, right? I'm gonna find that guy! Cut him into pieces! Bitch! What's the matter with you? - Are you alright? - Yeah, nothing new there. So, what time's the flight? Tomorrow... afternoon. Are you okay to fly? It's fine... Should be nice to give birth there. Boy or girl? I've a feeling it's a boy... though your brother prefers it to be a surprise. We shall see... Oh yeah... For when the baby's old enough. Thank you, Aunt Ladya. It'd be nice if you gave it yourself, though? I'm going to miss you so bad. Take good care in Sydney. Won't you join us till the airport, then? We don't know when we'll meet again, right? It'll be raining soon, honey. Ah! Someone's decided to come after all. Alam, you're a happy camper now, eh? What the...? Just in time. A storm out of nowhere. To Jakarta... with Ladya. Alam's happy. - Off we go! Oh, shit! - Who's she? She's shivering... - Lemme out! - Where are you going? To help her, damn it. Eko, wait! He's always like this... Guys, let's stay out of this. She says she's been robbed. - Where does she live? - Dunno; she's all spaced out. Uh, where do you live, miss? Where are you heading to? Would you like us to call a taxi, miss? We're going to Jakarta. Then... you will pass my house. Let's help her. I'm not sure, honey. She's just a girl, all alone. We can't leave her, right? Okay, okay. Miss, let us take you home, then. Just point out the way, okay? Take a seat. What now? Lemme drive, man. Be a bro, dammit. - Sorry, Astrid... - It's okay. Freaking baldie! Miss, what's your name? Maya. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Maya, are we going the right way? We've arrived. Would you like to come in? Thanks, but we're fine. I want to introduce you to Mother. Just to greet her. It won't take long. Would you... Eko? Uh... sure. Let me call Mother. The house smells like stale farts! You seem so tense... What's up? Nothing. It feels rather weird, though. Ease up. We'll be on our way soon. Okay? Everyone, this is Mother. - I am Dara. - Adjie. Astrid. How old is the baby? About 8 months now. My deepest gratitude for bringing Maya back home. We couldn't just leave her there by herself. Please stay for a bit. The baby could use some rest. I want to prepare a simple meal, as token of our gratitude. No need for that, ma'am. We ought to get ready anyway. I must insist: I won't allow myself to be rude, so allow me to repay your kindness. Take a short rest... before resuming your journey. It's alright, Adjie. You must all be hungry. You still have quite a distance to go. Maybe we could use a little rest. Sorry, but can I use the bathroom? Maya, would you take him upstairs? Please excuse me. You could've just said "No, thank you". We'd be on our way now. Sorry, man. It's fine, dear. Seems like it's going to rain, anyhow. Yeah, bro... I could use some grub. Right. Lam, can I get a light? - Just hold on to it. - Cheers. You scared me, jerk! Get a life. Should've seen your face. Classic moment! This place must be very old: look at those photos. Jim! Cool, huh? It looks kinda sharp, Lam! Serious killer, this one. Careful! Look: original Japanese. Razor sharp, eh? Yeah, just put it back, man. Too damn cool... Excuse me. It's an old keepsake, very fragile. He didn't mean anything by it. Did I scare you out there? No, I was just... I didn't want to intrude. Thank you for helping my sister. - Maya, she's your sister? - Yes. I'm Adam. Ladya. And your friends? That's Jimmy and Alam. Sorry, they're harmless. It's alright. No harm done. It's rare for someone to help others nowadays, even in the case of accidents. The tattoo: is there a meaning? This? Not at all, I just like the design. Do you like tattoos? I like to look at them... but I'm afraid of having one. May I touch it? Sure. Please drink this. Dinner's ready. You may come with us now. Actually, if it's alright I'd rather just rest here. Alright, dear? We have a guest room upstairs. Maya, take her upstairs. Follow me, please. I'll be fine, dear, just go and eat. Honey, wait! Actually, I'll stay with my wife. My friends will stay for dinner. Thank you. Where are you going? I'll catch up, honey. I'm staying with Astrid. After you're done, let's just roll, okay? Please. I'll leave you for now. Thank you, Maya. This is Arman. To our guests! Thank you for helping one of us. Please accept our small token of gratitude. You may begin. You made this all yourself? Damn, this is some gourmet meat! Definitely 5-star quality. Alam, you must try that one. Nice necklace; does it signify something? This family heirloom has been passed on for many generations. Why can't she get past it? Think of her future instead. Easy on yourself, dear. Eventually, everything will work out. You're okay? The baby's kicking hard. It's a girl, for sure. - How would you know? - A talker, just like her mom. This wine must be really vintage. My head's spinning. But damn, it's good! Eko, why don't you just spend the night here? Uh, sure... yeah. Mother, may I be excused? Ladya, try this. Let me try it. Tastes rather unique. I don't think I can finish this. I'm quite full. The other guests... They never finished either. How old are you, anyway? How old would you think I am? What's wrong, Eko? Arman, take them downstairs. Adam, prepare the tools. We have the first pick-up soon. You're awake. Where are the others? Your friends? They're upstairs. Yeah? I'm going up, then. Alam. Just wait. We never really got to talk. Why is that? Ladya's upstairs, too? What is it with her? Just come with me. Wouldn't you like... to have a taste... of what you're looking at now? L-I just wanted to know where the others are... I told you: they're upstairs. Why would you want to leave me all alone? I just want to see my friends!! Eko, where the hell are you? What now? What's so wrong with me? - Wait... - Why?! What, huh? What's wrong with me?! Jimmy!! Alam...? Alam!! Alam!! What do you want?! Huh? What about now? I'll stab you! I swear I will! Stay away. Alam? Alam!! Alam!! Adjie!! Go to the room!! Adjie! Adjie?! - Ladya, wake up! - Shh, Ladya! It stinks in here... Where are we? Alam!! Adjie!! Where the hell is everyone?! - That bitch... this is all her doing! - This is your fault! Hey! What do you want from us?! We'll pay! We have money! Call, just call them! Ladya! Be careful! Jimmy... Alam... it's Alam! Alam, we're in here! We're all tied up, help us!! Eko? Ladya, what's going on, dammit?! - The guy with glasses... - Call him, Ladya! - No! - Why? No... no! Alam? Please, God, no... He's dead. Why are you doing this?! I'm here, dear! Adjie! Astrid... The father of your child is alright. Stay there, dear! Don't come out! Adjie!? Don't hurt Astrid. Adjie! Adjie! Don't touch him! Your kindness towards Maya... brought all of you here tonight. Thank you, Astrid. No... not Ladya! Let Ladya go! I don't want to die... please. You fat son of a bitch! Eko, come on! You damn pig! Fat bastard! Come on, you fat shit! Let Ladya go! Let her go... Help! Please help us here! Good... everything is complete. Lady Dara? She's preoccupied right now. She sends her kindest regards to them. Help!! Do you feel it, Astrid? As of now, you can only rely on yourself. What you drank earlier... will aid you in getting through this. Have no fear... A woman's strength is such that few can imagine. Your pain right now... pales to insignificance compared to what you'll deliver to this earth. All your questions will soon be answered. Are you hearing that? My baby! My baby! Astrid! Where are we? Wait! We can't! Where the hell? The house! Come on! Eko! - Where's your car, Jim? - Huh? My car...? Jim? Ladya? Where the hell, man?! Maya? Ah! Ah! My ear! - Shit! Bitch! - We got to run, Eko! Eko, wait! Eko! Ladya, faster! Ladya...? Where's Ladya, Eko?! Ladya! Jim! How are we going to get outta here, Jim? 'Adv a. I can't take this shit anymore! Eko".Eko! Everyone's dead, Jim! They're all dead!! Ladya's all alone out there! - Dead... all dead! - Stop saying that! We... we have to... Jim... Where you going, man? Ladya, she's out there... Don't leave me, man! Jim!! You stay put! Slowly, Jim... Watch your step. Quick... Everything's going to be... Jimmy... Ladya. Run, Ladya! Jimmy! Huh? Jimmy? Adjie! Wake up... Stop! Not my baby... I can imagine the pain you are going through. A mother... who has to lose her child... Not even a name given... I'm giving you one chance. Take a look at your husband. Help him... and maybe you two can get out of here... and live longer. Should you choose the child, I promise you, all of you will be finished tonight. Please... The child is no longer yours. Astrid? Astrid? Dear...? Astrid! Astrid! Adjie! Hold it honey! Don't let go! Our baby... It's a boy... Sleep, my child. It shouldn't have ended like this. You bitch! Die!! Mother... May I help you? Sorry, sir. My name is Syarief. This here's my unit. Are you the owner of this villa? We have been living here for a while, sir. Would you come over here, ma'am? Who's that bald man? He's one of the students who are renting rooms here, sir. He's from Jakarta. A Jakarta kid, huh? No wonder... We found him by the road. I'd like to know how he ended up there. I asked for his help, sir. My dog went missing in the forest. Dog, you said? Anyone see a dog? - No, sir! - Didn't see any, sir. - I asked him to look for it. - Sure you did. Um, could you tell me how many rooms there are? You won't mind if I take a quick look around, right? You see, they're all top cops. Including me. I almost forgot... Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Sonny... Sonny Samba. Why don't we bring the boy back in? The poor boy must be freezing. Sure thing, ma'am. Alright, ma'am. As you know, it's our duty to fully investigate matters like this. Though could I request that the other kids don't cause any more trouble? So, are we clear of any problems then, sir? No problem at all, ma'am. - Petrus! - Yes, sir! Always with that damn phone! Bring the bald one in! Right away, sir! Wake up. Let's see the this necklace. - Yes, sir! - What the hell are you doing? - Help me out! - I'm waking baldie up, sir! - Don't you try anything funny. - I won't sir, I promise. - Quick, now! Baldie, wake up, wake up now! Quickly! - Baldie! Wake up! - Quick, I said!! Jeez! Okay, I'm getting down now, just chill... He's just unconscious. He'll be back up in no time. He's fortunate that I'm not dragging him down to the station. You're very understanding, sir. What's that sound? - Taufiq, check it out. - Yes, sir. Sir... are you alright? Sir? Sir... Sir? Sir... What's wrong? Dear God... Are you okay? Something's fishy in this house... Sir? Taufiq! Sonny! Mr Policeman... Oh, Miss. What's with the blackout, miss? Sonny! Taufiq!! Sonny! Taufiq!! Shit. Where the hell... Sonny! Taufiq!!! Taufiq!!! Taufiq!! Freeze!! Shit. Shit. Shitl! - What a mess, what an awful mess... - We're so screwed... Shit! This isn't right! Let's go, man! - Shut the hell up and stay close! - I'll shut up, okay! - Let's go! - Right bro, let's go... Lets roll. I'm here... I'm here... Taufiq!! Taufiq!! Sonny, where the hell are you?! Sonny, what's wrong?! Bro, get up! Stand up - he's coming! Freeze! Shit! Petrus... Damn! Come on, Sonny! Quick! Those bastards! Syarief? Syarief? Ma. Help me, ma'am... Ma. Help me, sir.. Where is it?! Hey, slut! Die, bitch! Bitch! M-mommy... mommy... My child... Adjie? Adjie... My son... Astrid, oh God... They're upstairs. Adam... Bring me their heads. Get the hell away from her! Die!!! You bitch! Adam! Adjie, watch out! Adjie! Adjie! Adjie, I'm so sorry, man. Forgive me. 'Adv a. Everything ends right here, Ladya. Adjie! I wanna go home! Please... home! Eko!! Ladya! Eko! Look at all this. Look at what you've caused tonight... - Where's the baby? - No! You'll never touch him! Why are you doing this? Why can't you just let us go?! They want you... because they want to live longer. You... You've tasted it... TASTY, RIGHT?! Adjie!!! Adjie!!! Ladya... watch... Watch over my son... Don't leave me, Adjie. Don't leave me, don't go... Forgive me... Unit 04... please report to base. Unit 04... Where are you guys patrolling? Please respond. H... hello? Hello... Let's go home...
