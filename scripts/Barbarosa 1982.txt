HIS RIFLE AGAINST MY LEG. BEHIND HIM, MARCELO AND TOMS LAY DEAD. THE GRINGO'S BEARD THAT ONCE HAD BEEN THE COLOR OF HONEY... NOW DRIPPED RED WITH BLOOD. - BARBAROSA. - BARBAROSA. RED BEARD. HE POINTED HIS RIFLE AT MY KNEE... THEN HE PULLED THE TRIGGER. POW! AND SHOT MY LEG OFF. HE DONE THE DEVIL'S WORK. - HE IS THE DEVIL ON EARTH. - GOD CHOSE US TO KILL HIM. AND SHOULD WE EVER FALTER IN OUR HOLY PURSUIT, SHOULD EVEN ONE ZAVALA COMPLAIN OR BECOME AFRAID... THEN GOD WILL PUT US BACK IN HOUSES MADE OF STICKS AND MUD. - AND TAKE AWAY OUR CATTLE. - AND OUR GOATS. - AND OUR LAND - AND OUR SHEEP.
