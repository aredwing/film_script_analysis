I was entrusted by our great leader, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, to film the heroic deeds of a distinguished reconnaissance unit under the command of Sergeant Novikov. I am proud to be a part of this mission in the Great Patriotic War. Long live motherland, and long live Czarevitch Stalin. For you. - Very good, Seryosha. - Very good. Very strong. Ivan. Ivan, don't- Very good. Look where you go. Don't trip up. Vanya, yes, very good. Very good. No, too much. Too much, Vanya. Sacha! Hurry up there! I need to use the other camera. How many times must I tell you, eh? Be careful with it! Give me. Turn it on. Give me. Give me. Turn it on. Give me. - There is the sniper's nest. It's crucial that we destroy this nest. It's a potential death trap for our advancing troops. Vassili, Alexei, you flank it from the right and left. Ivan and I will divert attention. Let's get as much gear off as we can. We need to be light. Sacha, you stay here, and you guard the gear, huh? - Take cover! - Kill him! Kill him! Grenade! - Whoa! - Grenade! - Ah, shit! - God- Fuck off, Dima. - Um, can you go behind me? I can't see a thing. Jesus Christ... - Sir! Over here! - Keep the fucking noise down, boy! - What the fuck? - Ooh... - Fucking hooligan. - I don't give a shit. We're here to help our comrades. Let's go. - Bear Cobra 3-1-9 calling Mother. Do you read me? Over. Do you read me? Over. Bear Cobra 3-1-9 calling Mother. Do you read me? Over. Dima, you think you got some good shots today, huh? - Can I ask you a few questions, for the folks back home in Russia? You don't sound Russian. Where are you from? - Krakow, Poland. I escaped east when the Nazis invaded. Here. She is why I'm here. Seryosha, get over here. - You think it's worth it? - Maybe. - Dima, it's only- - Moscow Jewboy! - Where are you? You're a liberator! - You Polish cunt! You are going straight to military tribunal! Give me the camera! If you don't get off that fucking bicycle... Sacha! You drunken- - This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3. We are trapped. Does anyone read me? Over. This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3. We are trapped. Does anyone read me? Over. - Misha? - This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3. - Misha, I've got something. Hello? Tiger Bear 3-0-3? We read you. Over. - We are trapped. - We can't hold out much longer. Our position is 511728 north by 132204 east. Do you read me? - Hello? - Tiger Bear 3-0-3. What is your situation? Over. - We can't hold out much longer. Our position is 511728 north by 13- - They can't hear us. - What one is it? - Some mining village in the middle of nowhere. We're not far. If we get a move on, we could be there by noon. - Don't you think it's strange? Who is Tiger Bear? I thought we were the only reconnaissance. - They're Russians- our boys- and they need help. What more do you need to know? You better inform Mother. - I wish I could. That crazy message is the only thing I've received for two days. - Dima, pack your stuff away. We won't wait for you. - Eh? - Here's one, shot already, eh? Fucking fritzie. - Let me... Ugh... - Shit! Shit. Damn you! - What's going on? - Nothing. - Nothing. Nothing is going on. - Do me a favor and stay with the squad. - Is that it? - There's a lot of damage. There's been fighting here. Do you see anything? - Nothing. No Russians. No Germans. Not even a stinking goat. - All right. We're going through the trees very slowly, huh? And you stay at the back and keep out of the fucking way. - Dima! Come on. Get down, you idiot! - I don't get it. That's artillery damage, not aircraft. We don't have artillery within 50 kilometers of here. Who did this? - Let's move down to the church and take it from there. Move. - I don't care who did this. They're bastards, whoever they are. - Oh, God. They are nuns. - Oh, God. - One is still alive. Who did this, huh? Who did this to you? It's the Nazis, right? Say it's the Nazis. Say it! - For God's sake, Dima. - Say it! Say-say-say it. - Whoa! - Are you all right? - I fell into a fucking grave, but I'll be all right. - Hey! - What was that? - What kind of church is this? - This is more like a factory. - Fuck... Sacha! None of your stupid games here, huh? It could be dangerous! - Sacha. Sacha, go down there, see if you can find a light switch. - Why? - Because we need more light. Go. Sash... - Sash! - What? - See if you can get the generator started. - Why? - Don't argue. - Just do it. One... Ugh. - Hey, camera-with-legs, come over here. Hey, look at what we have found. - What's going on? Sacha, is that you? - Misha... - Don't you think this is- - No, no, no, no. Don't touch it! Don't touch it! - Uh! - What the... - Vassili, don't- - Don't touch it, Vassili! - Can you hear me? I think it's blind. I don't think it can see us, huh? What are you? Can you hear me? - Let's put you out of your miser- - Misha! - Novikov! Get it! - Vassili! - Vassili, get it! Get it out! Get it out! - Get it of Get it off me! Get it off me! - Kill it! - Kill it! Get it off him! Get it off! - Oh, my God, Misha. Just relax. Just stay still. Here, here. Okay, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. - Don't move. - Don't move. Sacha, for God's sakes, turn that thing off! Ugh! - Calling Mother. - Do you read me? Over. Do you read me? Over. We're being jammed. It's the only explanation. It's been days since I got a scratch out of the damn thing. - What if we used the tower? - That's not a bad idea. Not a bad idea. - Vasja. - Vasja. We are here now. You heard that Mayday. Our boys need help. - Where the fuck are they, then, eh? - Listen, we need to search the village properly. Otherwise, Novikov has died for nothing. He's right, Vasja. Take the others. I'll stay here with Sacha and their gear. Go to the village, find someone, anyone, who can tell us what is going on here. - Correct me if I'm wrong, Seryosha, but I'm next in command after Novikov. - I don't think so. Look at the stripes. - Who gives a fuck about stripes? I have been with this unit longer than anyone. - That doesn't mean you're in charge, Vasja! Oh, no? Well, let's ask the others. - Vasja, Sergei is right. - Shut the fuck up, you Jewboy! You're here just to make pretty pictures. - Vasja, you're too smart to be in charge. Let Seryosha have his fun. We can always slit his throat later. - Alexei? Sacha? You want him to be in command? The fucking radio hand? He's not even Russian. Okay, have it your way. But don't come crying to me when he leads us into some fritzie trap. Stop fucking filming! - Comrade, control your temper. - Make another sound, I fucking shoot your balls off! - Alexei, where are you going? - Dima, be safer outside. Do not get in my way. - We might have found some dinner. Mmm. Come here, little Bunny. Come over here. Ah! Ah! - Guys, look! - There is someone here! - No, Alexei, no! Alexei! Alexei. We're supposed to get a prisoner, remember, to interrogate, find out where our boys are, yeah? - Sie sind-Sie sind meine Hasen. - What's the crazy old tramp saying, eh? - Something about stealing his rabbits. - Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. I'm liberating your rabbits from fascist oppression. What is this place? - I don't understand. - What is this? - Vasja, if you let me, I-I have experience in this sort of... interviews. - Interviews, yeah? This, I want to see. - What is going on here, huh? Where has everybody gone? - Everybody's dead or run away. - What were they running from? - That's a weird camera. Is that a microphone? Are you recording sound? I've never seen a camera like this before. What were they running from? - I-I From... - From things... - What things? - The doctor makes. - What things? Where is the doctor now? - Shut it! Who gives a fuck about this doctor? We want to know about Tiger Bear 3-0-3. Ivan, hold him. - Comrade, listen. There was obviously some sort of secret project going on. - Oh, that's obvious, is it? - Tiger Bear must have been sent here for that very reason. Vasja, if you find the doctor, we'll probably find- - That's fucking fascinating, comrade. Now get the fuck behind the camera. We have wasted enough time. Where are the Russians? - Ah! - Where? - I don't know! I just feed the animals. - Where- - Ah! I'll take you there. - Oh, if you take me there, you will never have to worry about getting hurt ever again. Come on. Let's go. - Keep moving! - Vasja, do you think this is wise? - Shut up. - What if there are more like the ones in the church, eh? - Here. Ah. It's down there. - The Russian soldiers are down there? - Yes. - Down there? - Yeah. You-you go. You'll see. - It's not safe here, Vasja. Let us take him back to Seryosha. - I'm in charge here, so fucking do what I tell you. Show us. - No, no, I wouldn't- - No, you fucking show us! Come on. - Ah! - Ah! - Vassili, keep an eye on him. How far is it? Ah, this way? You go fir- Fuck. Where has he gone? Where has he gone? I told you, keep an eye on him! - Where the hell... - Now you go ahead. - Ivan, check that side. Alexei. Over there. Where the hell is he? What? - What? - Shit. - What the... - Get out of the way! - Don't shoot! You're gonna shoot me, you idiot! - Get out! - Get out! Go, go, go, go, go! Shoot! Shoo. - Help! - Help! Alexei! Fucking help! - Let's get out of here, now! Get out of here! - Which way? - Go, go, go, go! Ahh! - Agh! - Shoot it! Kill it! Kill it! Get the hell out of here now! - One more! - One more! - Get out! - Okay, let's get out of here! - Over here. - This way! This way! This direction! Here! - Oh! - There's one more! There's one more there! Go, go, go, go! Out! Out! - Watch it! - There's more, more, more! - Guys, where are you? - Close the door! - Over here. - Close the door! - Ah! - Oh, no! - Shoot this motherfucker! Kill it! Kill it! Shoot it! Shoot it! - Shoot it! God! - Right now. Get away! - Get away! - Run! - Run, run, run! - Get it out. - No. No, I don't think that's a good idea. - Please... - Don't fret, my friend. - I'm not giving up on you yet. - Leave him. - He's finished. We're getting out of here. - Get back to your post! You're supposed to be keeping watch. - FUCK you! Those things, they appear out of nowhere. They could be all around us, and we wouldn't even know. Fuck out of the way. I'll finish him off. - Ugh! - Ah! - On... Fuck. - Vasja! - I'll fucking decide when I'm finished and who finishes me off. Where's that freak? ' Who? Dima? No, you idiot. That tramp... set us up... Trap! "I just feed the animals. " - This is your fault. You were supposed to bring a captive back here. - Sacha. All quiet here? - You're an educated man, Dima. What do you think is going on here? - I am... not sure. I think we have stumbled upon a new Nazi weapon. Only the Nazis would think of something like this... Sewing dead people together and giving them knives for hands. It's insane. - Or brilliant. No, Dima. It's insane. We'll move in the morning, and then we'll find this Tiger Bear 3-0-3. - They're dead, and we will be too if we hang around here any longer. - Sacha, go down! Sacha! - Go around! Sacha! - Hands up! - Hands in the air! Come on! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! - No, no! - Against the wall! Over there! - No, that is a girl! That's a girl! - That's a girl! - No, no, no, no! - Get over here! - Vasja! - No, no, no, no! - Vasja! - Enough! - Enough! - Where are the Russians? - Please... - Where are the Russians? - You are Russians, no? - There where other Russians here. Yesterday! - I-I don't know. We've been hiding. - Just the four of you? - Everyone else was killed or ran. It was a massacre. - Who killed them? - The undead ones. Listen, the gunshots and your firelight... We must hide before they come looking. - Where do they come from? - Dima, leave this to me! How many were there? - We don't know. He keeps making more. We must hide now. Please. - This is bullshit. - Let's just kill them. Noi Du darfst mich schiessen! - Nein, nein! - Bitte, bitte! Du darfst mich erschiessen statt ihr. - What did he say? Fritz says it's okay if you shoot him. He'd rather be shot by a real man than ripped apart by those things out there. - Let's just kill them. - Keep the girl. Come here. - No, no, no, no. I am a trained nurse, Ja? Look! I can help your friend. - A trained nurse? - I can help your friend. I will help your comrade, Ja? - Here. - Just breathe. Vanya, breathe. Well, can you get it off? - I don't know. - You get it off, and we'll let you live. Deal? - I... - I can try. - You heard him, bitch. Get on with it. - Okay, Vanya, what we'll do- - Breathe. - Slowly! - SIOWly! Breathe! - Ivan... - Ivan, look at the nurse. - Don't move. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Well, that was fucking useless. - No, no! We must work together. We're all human. Please don't hurt me. Please! No, no! - Vasja! - No! - No! - Vasja! - Ah! - Alexei! - Shoot that thing, somebody! - Shoot it, Sacha! - Shoot it! Alexei, hold on! - Shoot it! Shoot it! Someone stop it! Stop it! Sacha! Sacha, follow me! - Sacha! - Dima, careful! Where is it? - Shoot! - Shit! Sacha! Sergei! - I'll get the camera! I got it. I got it. I got the camera. Dima, I got the camera! - Ahh! - Grenade! - Get down! - Dima! - Dima! - Are you all right? - My eyes... - Sacha. Sacha, give me the camera. - Take it. - Here! Down the hole! Quickly! ' Eva! Eva! Eva! - No, no, this way. - This way, Dima! Sacha! Dima! - Come on, Vasja! - Grenade! - Hey! - Does anyone read me? - Over. We are trapped. We can't hold out much longer. Our position is 511728 north by 132204 east. Do you read me? Over. - I don't fucking believe this. - Sergei. Comrade. Let me explain- - What's going on? - Why don't you ask Comrade Dima? - What? - Tell them... before I blow your fucking brains out. - You don't understand. - Tell them! - There's no Tiger Bear 3-0-3. - I don't get it. - Here. It's a radio jammer. I couldn't understand why we were getting no signal before. This is why. Our comrade here was blocking us, cutting us off from Mother. - And I was carrying the fucking thing! - He could use it to transmit the message from his pack to the radio and... - And lead us here. So there is no... - No Tiger Bear, no Russian soldiers needing our help. - Fucking bastard! - Oo. Ah! - Wait, Vasja. Don't kill him yet. First I want to know why. - We are not going anywhere. Not going anywhere. - That Fritz must know the way. - We'll follow him. - That fucking old fascist? - You don't understand. We are not leaving. That's an order. - An order? I'm going to cut his balls off- - Here, here, here, here. - Oo. - Read this document. I'm a full captain, your superior officer. I have a list of every man in this squad's family and loved ones. If something happens to me... - What? - You know what will happen to them. - Right. - Dima... Tell me... Why didn't you just tell us? Huh? Why the trick? - This is a top secret mission. The bureau was afraid there might be a leak. - So you let us come unprepared? - No, I did not know the exact nature of the work that the doctor was working on. - He's not a doctor. He's a madman. - My orders are to capture him, if possible. If not, kill him. - Capture? What does the glorious motherland... - Listen! - Want with that madman? - Listen to me! This is none of your business. You do your job; You go home safe and sound. Do you understand? - Is there even film in that camera? - Yes, yes. - The film is real. I need a record of everything just in case we cannot take him alive. Now, Fritz. We are going to the doctor's base, and you-you're taking us there. Which way? - This is the lift up to the church. - If these things are a Nazi weapon, they've turned on their master. Not so brilliant, huh, Dima? Ah, fuck. - Fritz, you used to work here, right? Where is the doctor? - Hey! Which way? - Den Gleisen. Folgen. - Dima, you can't be serious. You want to go to the base of this thing? It's suicide. - I thought I made it clear. Our job is to find and capture the doctor. - Or kill. Captured or killed, you said. - Yes, yes, yes. - Moscow wants him alive. - They're here! - Go! Get out, Dima! Run, Dima! For God's sakes! - Get in! Close the door! Close the door! ' Gun! - Get the fucking gun! - Go! - Come on! Run faster! - Get in. - Close the door! - Come on, let's go! Forget the gun! Get inside! - Lock it in, you fucking idiot! - What the fuck? - No, leave it! It can't hurt us. - This one can't hurt us. At last, we're getting somewhere. - Nein! - Nein! - Little fascist... - Sacha, go down there and take a look. - What? - You crazy? - I've got a better idea. Vasja, get the boy. - Right. - In you go. - Nein! - "Nein! - Nein!" Come on. - Wait! First we'll take you down, then we'll bring you back. - In you QO- - Nein! Nein! - I've got you! - Hans, tell me what you see! - Pull! Pull! Pull him up. - Ugh! - Shoot it! Just do something! God damn it! - Sacha, the wire! Try and cut the wire! Get back! Cut the fucking wire! The wire! Cut it, Sacha! - Down! - Get down! - You all right, Captain? Thanks, Seryosha. - Okay, let us go down there. We can fix a rope. I told you, the doctor's lab is down there. - Of course, Dima. After you! - Ahh... - So, Dima. You want to continue your secret mission? You do it alone. I'm taking my men out of this mad hole. Bye-bye, Jewboy. Oh, sorry, I mean, Captain Jewboy. - Don't forget your precious film. - Traitors. Fucking traitors. All of them. Comrades! Come back! I order you, come back! Screw you, Czarevitch Stalin. Screw you, party slaves! Soul of the proletariat, my ass. You will all be shot anyway! You'll all be shot anyway! Fucking retard. Oh, God... I'm going to hell. - I am in hell. Mama, Papa, this is my last roll of film. Do not trust what they tell you. I made a deal with the government. They promised to let you go in exchange for the doctor. I don't think that's happening anymore. I'm sorry. I love you, and I'm gonna miss you. Oh, fuck. - Oh, God... Nein. Nein. Bleibt hier. Du musst mich t6ten. Ich bin schon. I ch bitte dich. Du bist Arsch. VWrklich! I ch bitte dich! Nein! Nein, nein, nein! I ch bitte dich! Nein. I ch bitte dich. Nein! Nein! Ahh! Nein! I ch bitte dich! Nein! Nein! I ch bitte dich. "Okay" - Oh, God... " Okay" Okay - Ivan... Ivan, it's me, Dimitri. Ivan. Whoa! Hey! Ivan! Ivan! What- - Okay, give us something good. No, no, not my finger. Not my finger. Is it filming? Yeah? Good. Here. It's good. Eat this. It will make you strong. It's eintopf. - I'm not hungry. - Eat. - I need you to be strong. - Do you like it? It's really good. I have added some of my own ingredients in it. - I need you to be strong to make a record of my work here. - Your work? - For posterity, you know? You're Dr. Frankenstein? - Do you think you can do this? Do you think you can do this for me? - Swallow. Swallow. Swallow! - Are you filming? - Yes. - Okay. - Come in. Go, go, go, follow. Come. Oh, don't be shy. Come. My father said man would be more efficient if they have hammers and screwdrivers instead of fingers. Here, use this. When I tried to do it with cats, he told me it was a sin against God. He-he beat me. It's not a sin. It's simple mechanics, engineering. Ugh! Well... After Father died, the Nazis closed the factory and sent me to a camp. Someone told the Sturmbannfiihrer about my cats. He asked me if I could do the same with people. So I used Grandfather's notes. His techniques were quite crude. He needed thunderstorms, but now I can do it with a generator! - That's fascinating, Viktor. Can you explain how your automatons receive and follow orders and- - What did you say? They are not machines or puppets... - Sorry, sorry. - I-I-I. - Like the toys my father built! Each one is still alive. - I see. - They even need to eat. Go, hurry UP- I feed them with the same eintopf I gave you. - Yes. - Ah, fuck you! FUCK you! - Here they are. - At least one is still alive. - FUCK you! - FUCK you! - Don't do this to me. - Fuck you all. - Don't do this to me. - Fuck you! Fuck You! - FUCK you! Fuck you. Son of a... - God... - He'll be fine. I'll take care of him. Come, come, come. - Incredible. - Come! I want to show you something. Come in! - Yes, yes. - I'm coming. - Come here. I want to show you something. This is the generator. - I see. - Look. - It works. It works! - Genius. This is genius! - Come with me. - Come. I'll show you something else. - Doctor... - What? - Listen. Listen! Can't you hear it? - What was that? - It's us, the Red Army, our artillery. - How far away would you say they are? - 15 kilometers? They could be here in a matter of hours. - You're telling me this because... - I am here to offer you a deal. Our military leadership is very interested in your work. - Of course. I'll give you my weapon to use against Western Allies to turn the whole world into a socialist utopia, right? - Yes, I think we understand each other very well. - And if I refuse? - We'll bomb you and your army back to the Stone Age. Very nice. How fucking cozy. - In experiments, the fresher the specimens, the better. And if I can use flesh that is still alive, I can perform miracles. - Still alive? - Tell me, which of these two is a better Communist? - Wha-what? - Which of these two is a better Communist? - This one is a better Communist. Don't! No! - Hans! - Ready? - Yes. - So, Sturmbannfiihrer, we meet again. - Viktor, bitte. Es tut mir leid dass wir versucht haben Ihr aufzuhalten. - Hush now, Dieter. You don't have to apologize. I'm going to make it all okay. - Doctor, there's no time. The Red Army is almost here. If you want to work for me, you need to tell me now. - Enough! I said I would think about it. Now focus. - Nein. Vi ktor. Nein. Nein. - Dima... - HEY- HEY- I told you to film. SorfY- - What are you doing? - Don't you see? I can-I can end the war by creating a new being that brings them together. - Are you serious? - I can make them stop. I can make them understand each other. I'll be right back. - Dima... Help me. Help me... Help me, please. Please... - I can't, Seryosha. I have to bring him back no matter what. - Dima... Don't you understand? He's crazy. Dima, he's insane. - I told you-I told you, I can't. I promise you this, Seryosha, when I return to Moscow, I will personally ensure you're awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal. - Your sacrifice will not be forgotten. - Dima! I swear, I'll kill you. I swear, I'll kill you! Dima! - As you can see, the two halves of the brain have been grafted together. On the left side, the Communists. Hold on. Yeah... On the right side, the Nazi's. Yeah. That will be... That's too much here. Okay. I think- Oh, shit. Shit, come on. Okay, that's fine. Let me fix that. The patient is no longer breathing. Now... For the final step. Drei! Z Wei! Eins! Jetzt! - It's obviously suffering from a little readjustment problem! I can build more! - Ahh! - What are you doing? What are you doing? - How does that work? I need a different lens. How do you operate this camera? - Doctor, we had a deal. Listen, we had a deal, eh? You will be safe in Russia. - What deal? - I have-I have people there. Orders... Enemies of the state, eh? You will be safe. What about our deal? - I am afraid I am going to have to refuse your generous offer. - You are signing your own death warrant. If we don't kill you, your own people will. You understand that? - Oh, yes, I know. I was in a prison camp, remember? But I have other plans. - No, no, no! - Don't-don't leave me! D"'t 90! Ah! - I'll be leaving momentarily. But there should be time for one last experiment. - No, you can't. - You can't. - I can. - I can. Come here. Come here. Now, what shall we do with you? Maybe... Maybe I will build this camera into your skull. That might be fun. - You fool. - A man-a man of vision is always misunderstood. But the film in your camera will convince the doubters. - You're insane! You're not a doctor! - You're sick! - Oh, yes. - You hear me? - You're sick! - Oh, yes, I'm sick. Everybody's sick! The Nazis. Communists. Capitalists. Everyone! The sickness cannot be cured, so it must be cut out, and my creations will do that. - Your creations are fucking insanity! Look at them. They're fucking cripples! Okay... My father... Tried to have me locked up. He said I was emotionally crippled. - I had no choice. I injected him with a drug that paralyzed him, but his eyes could still move, so he could watch as I- - No, no, no! No, no, no! - What was that? - That is the beginning of the carpet bombardment- - I will not have time for you after all! That is-that is my comrades coming to wipe you off the face of this planet! The deal, the deal I offered, I will make it better. Anything! Anything! Tell me what you need. - I'll guarantee it! - Okay, okay, okay. I am afraid after I go, my soldiers may become a bit crazy. - What-what are you talking about? - They obey only me, and I cannot take them with me, so after I go, they will turn out against each other and anything else they find nearby. - I would love to tell you more, but I have got-I've got to go. So good luck, comrade. The film... Proof for the doubters to make them believe. " Gah!" - But it won't reveal my real secrets. Do you know why? Look at me. Do you know why? Because they are all locked up in here. So I'm going to take your camera with me. Ugh... " No!" Sacha! You fucking idiot! Idiot! Well, don't just stand there! Let me loose, you fuck! - Sacha. - Sacha. Sacha. Sacha! Sacha! Sacha, no, no, no, no. Sacha, come on. Sacha! Sacha! Sacha, no, don't leave me! Please, please, please, please! Sacha! Don't leave me. Sacha! - Sacha. - Sacha, thank God. - Sacha, thank you. Sacha, listen! I was only trying to help my mother! - No, I cannot. - I'm sorry. I promised to bring them this camera, Dima. - I will make sure that you get the Hero of the Soviet Union medal. - Don't just stand there! Please! - Help! - He'll me! Sacha, do something! " No!" - Ahh!
