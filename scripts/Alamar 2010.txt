Because "going to" answers which question? - Answer... - What thing? Answer, "going to." Where? I went where. He's asking... The verb "go" answers which question? It is said go, where to? In Spanish you don't say go to what. You say, go to where. Then answer... Wait. Just look at that, the center of Rome. The time we were together, Roberta and Jorge... it was a magical time. How long have we been together? Three and a half years? Sometimes I think God made us meet so that Natan could be born. I don't know, it's as if I was brought here to work, find you, and to have Natan. And it's like we were destined for each other, you know? So that this specific boy would be born, with this specific story, in this specific part of the world. When we realized these feelings had changed, it was difficult. I was lost. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to... I could see things were falling apart. It's not just a problem about feelings. The problem is also that... you can't see that we are so different, that I'm unhappy with your reality and you are with mine. And together we are unhappy. Look at how we live now. He is in the middle of the jungle in the sea, in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't live here. I would die in a place like this. Natan, open your eyes for mommy. Natan, wake up, Daddy is arriving soon. Natan, good morning. Good morning. Natan, wake up for Mommy. Let's go, I have to get you ready and take a shower. Good morning! Hi, love. It's hot, hot, hot. Cold, cold, cold. Clean yourself. Cold, cold, cold. One, two, three, four, five... and six, if I had another one. Come on, Natan, hurry. There we go, done. Give me a hug. Goodbye, my love. We'll be gone for a while. And when you come back, then you'll go with Mommy. Look, it's grandfather! Everything going okay? We were almost the last ones left. This is the meter I used to finish my boat. #I'm here waiting to get on this boat # #I'm going to the sea, even if it means I have to go walking # #Woa-oaaaa, walking there # #There's no, there's no hurry to get there # #There's no need to know how to get there. # This is how it fits. I'll see you soon, okay? Don't jump in the water. You wait for me here, please. Use both hands. Was it cold? - Did you get tired? - It was a good swim. A bit tiring. #Looking at your eyes, baby. # It was a good swim. I was looking for a cave but couldn't find it. A deep cave, but didn't find it. Don't dry off, we're diving in again. There's a spot over there. Got it? Got it. Let's go to the reef. Ready, my love? You want to see the corals and the fish down there? Do you want to see the stars and the snails? You want to see the sharks? Well then, you have to use this so you can stay under the water longer. And nothing is going to happen. When you get out, you can take it off. Okay? We're gong to give it a try, okay? Let's go. I'm going to let you go. Look under the water. Everything's fine, don't worry. Look, Natan. Look under the water. Spit the water out, strong. Strong. Here it is, Daddy. Daddy, this one is broken. You can throw it away if you want. Come here, son. We're here. Exactly, Matraca! He won't do it again, you will see. Check out this huge snapper. It's got strong teeth. Touch them. It's true. If it bites you... - It breaks your finger. - Yes, breaks a finger. And it could fall off. That's it. Very good, one more. - This one's small. - Get the bigger ones. Get the bigger ones first, son - This one is big. - Yes, that one. Very well. The small ones have to be measured. These two are small. It goes in as well. Yours is eight and a half. Perfect. He was still standing. He could remain standing, drink after drink. It was a big black bottle. And he drinks a lot? A lot. - What's he do in Majahual? - Scuba diving. I miss you I love you. I want you. My love, you are so far away from me. Chawa. Daddy, I'm arranging this thing so you can use more line. Natan, why did you tie this up? - God damn it! - No, it got tied up by itself. It got tied up, Daddy. It got tied up. This is wrong! You can't do that with the ropes, son. You shouldn't tie them up like that. I didn't tie them up. Fishing is about luck. And patience. Without patience, you can't be a fisherman. Go! Pull it. Fight it, pull, pull. Make the effort. Pull. Pull, pull. Make an effort. Look at this! Look at it! That's why I couldn't pull it. Hold it from the top, son. Hold it strongly, with both hands. Natan! Don't let it go yet! Let us know when you're tired. Get me another one, son. That's it, the little head! This is a blonde. Oh, it's broken. See? Slowly, one by one. Give me, son. A seagull. There's another one, two, three. Which are those? Those? The ones above us? Yes. They are... I think they're frigate birds. I like them. One, two, three! That one over there ate it. One, two, three! The one down there ate it. That one ate it. Wait just one moment! Those who live at sea live happily. You have to love the sea, otherwise you'll be unhappy. You'll get seasick and hate everything around you. It's beautiful here at sea. That's why I'm sitting here watching the night. As simple as that, I sit here alone and drink my coffee. Watching for a while, then off to sleep. In the morning, I make my breakfast and get ready for work. When it bites, you pull it like that. Let's go. Pull it, pull it fast. Faster, go on faster. Here, this is how you do it. Careful, get out of the way. Out of the way, move it! Pass me the bat. A smack on the head, or what? Come on pull it up, pull it up! Bring it up. Here it comes. Careful. Where should I put it, Daddy? How do you say it? - Scales - To scale. I don't mean that. I mean this thing here. Yes, that's a scale. What's it called when you do this? To sca... - To scale. - To scale. Where are the beans? Fat fish. What did you say? That I will get a big belly? Or I heard wrong? - It's the barracuda, right? - Yes, it is. The tortillas are there, please eat. I don't want lobster. There is no lobster, this is barracuda. Eat. I bet you don't have that in Italy. They don't go fishing there. They don't fish, right, son? The fish is already bought in Italy. Natan, if they want to take you to Italy, you go and hide. Eat your meal, buddy. Jaimito. Checked the weather forecast? No, not yet. Ok, let me know as soon as you know something. There are signs of a storm that's coming this way. Really? I don't think it will get here. Probably not until Monday or Tuesday. It will be cold front number eleven. It's very far away, coming Monday or Tuesday. Okay, man. I'll see you tomorrow then. Okay, Nestor, we'll be in touch. Bubulcus Ibis. "Cattle egret" is her common name. They come from far away. - From Africa. - From Africa. I dropped it and she ate it fast. This is ready. A great fish broth. It's delicious, right? She's looking for food. And if she flies away? Well, she'll go home. For God's sake. - Is it spicy? - Yes, the sauce is spicy. A little fish just jumped. It jumped out to catch something. Look, Daddy! Watch out for the crocodiles. Daddy, can I get my hair wet? If Grandpa said you can, go ahead. Just be careful with the crocodiles. Here comes one. Come here. Be careful of that crocodile. It's getting near. It can eat you. There he was hanging it out while she was like this. I saw your hand. C'mon, watch it. Look at the size of it. It's dead. Let's go, Daddy. - We're going. - He's your Daddy too, huh? Oh, yeah, yours too. Let's go, Daddy! I guess the joke's on me. You can put the rope over there. She has stayed over there. Blanquita will sleep there. - Is it her? - Yes. It's no fair like that. Let's see the scar? It's fine. Are you better? - Yes or no? - Yes. Speak up then. - You're okay? - Yes. A little head butt. She's here! Come here. Come. Come here, come here. I told her to come and she stepped on my foot. She grabbed it fast. I was pulling it back, all she left was the bug's feet. You're very fast, friend. Want to come? Slowly, son. Slowly, boy. If you do it like that, she gets scared. You have to be gentle, it's a bird. She's a wild bird who lives with other birds. We're too big for her. Slowly. That's right, like that. Again. Easy, slowly. Very good. - Get up, Blanquita. - It's because of her leg. Put your arm in front. Without fear, it's all right. Come up. Up. - I'll look for an insect. - That's it, very good. Go with Natan. Up, Blanquita. Get up, Natan won't harm you. She walked on my leg. Put out your arm, son. Near her. Get up, Blanquita. She wants to get up on the other one, Daddy. Come over here, Blanquita. I will put her here. - This is how you throw it. - Oh, like this? You can do it like this. Give it to me. Thank you. Check out this beautiful snapper. A real beauty. Here is another little one. No, that's a big one. See? Well. Am I learning or what? You're getting very good at it, son. I think I'm learning well, Dad. It's all yours, son. A gift from your friend. Impossible. Blanquita doesn't speak like that. I was wrong. It got cold. It tastes bitter now. It's very strong, right? Very strong. - I like my coffee strong. - That's why you don't sleep. Well, the coffee really doesn't take my sleep away. Me neither, I drink my coffee every night before going to bed. Me too. Me too, when I'm with my buddies we always have coffee. But we drink it during the daytime with the old guys. With my buddies, the young guys. What do you mean by young guys? Are they your age? If they are your age, then that's not young anymore. Yeah, that's not young anymore. You have lived many springtimes. You're not that young anymore. Well, I'm still young at heart. I don't feel old. To feel old and be old are different. Like some guys who feel old. Not me. The only thing that's old are the roads... and we're still on them. There was a white bird which came by our house and my son wants to see her again. - Have you seen her around? - Yesterday she was close by. She must be over there somewhere. Where we saw her. And where we saw the crab too. I heard her. Yes, me too. Shall we go and see? Call her again, son. Over there. Everything okay? There's no blood there. Call her, she knows your voice. Here, here. I got it. This slope is very... this slope is very short. Very good. What's this, son? Mangrove. It looks like a mangrove, doesn't it? Well, that's a seed. - Yeah? - A seed from this little plant. This little plant's seed. Look, Natan. Flowers. Do you know what that's called? Anacahuite. White Siricote. Like the one over there. Are the green ones the same as the white ones? Yes, when they get older, they will turn white. - Like the one I see now. - Exactly, like the one over there. Soon you'll be flying to Rome with Mommy. And I'll be looking after you wherever you are. Doesn't matter what happens, I'll be looking after you. #I want to go to the sea, even if it means I have to go walking # #Walking # #Walking # #There's no, there's no hurry to get there. # Coffee with sugar? Yes, son, you made it very strong. Very strong. You make it with no sugar. Which one is mine? This one. I can drink three... two more cups. So stay sharp. #Five stingrays, five stingrays # #The crocodile's teeth # #Two barracudas because you caught two. # Its other eye is on the other side. The other. Now I will draw its mouth. The stingrays are gray, aren't they? The stingray has this color. This color and so is its tail. Some are like that, but there are also some gray ones like you said. And others that are brown as Grandpa says. Fish and then, what else did we see? The camera! Sometimes it's tiring. - It hurts. - As people live. It's about that too. I'd like to visit a place other than mine. Get to know other people different from us. The palafitte. I know how to do it. Blanquita, flying with her wings. And where is the color blue? The color blue. This... small paper and this flower will go to Italy or Mexico. I can make big bubbles. You want to make a big one? Grab it. - See how big it is. - I'll do one.
