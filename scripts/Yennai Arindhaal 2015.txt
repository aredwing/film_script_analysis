In this day and age! That too, on the busiest day of my life. No, dear. They wanted to come over and I couldn't... No, she is the older one. She lives in Boston. She is going to have a baby. That's why we are all travelling there. She is leaving tomorrow. We are leaving four days later. She'll be back in ten days. They told me that you sing very well. Heard that you've won prizes too. Why don't you sing for us, please? (A cheesy song) "Hey, violet colored ribbon..." "Who is your daddy?" "Hey, rosy cheeked girl, Who is your mommy?" Thenmozhi, come! It's your song. Coming. -Are you leaving today? Tomorrow 3.45 AM flight. That's why I chose today. "Im never gonna give my hand Unless hes the man" "I really couldnt care a damn Im fine as I am" "Just show me the man For surely I can" "But I wouldnt go land If hes not the manHola!" "Im never gonna give my hand Unless hes the man" "I really couldnt care a damn Im fine as I am" "Just show me the man For I know the brand" "And stop making plans Cause hes not the man" "My precious love!" "My precious quest!" "Why is there no man to win me over?" "Why am I not searching wondering who he is?" "Looking into his eyes... Holding his hands..." "I want to declare my precious love" "Why is there no man to win me over?" "Why am I not searching wondering who he is?" "Looking into his eyes... Holding his hands..." "I want to declare my precious love" "My precious love!" "My precious quest!" "In my skies, the clouds are like on any other day" "They simply scatter fair blue all around" "My days are long; My nights are deep; My dreams are noble;" "I find that solitude's a delight" "In my skies, the clouds are like on any other day" "They simply scatter fair blue all around" "My days are long; My nights are deep; My dreams are noble;" "I find that solitude's a delight" Mom, he asked me to sing and also asked if I can cook. I mean, what the hell was that? No, dad. Not interested. "My precious love!" "My precious quest!" Flight to Chennai. Sorry. You should've been here half an hour earlier. Flight's closed. I have to get on this flight. What's the problem, Malar? -There's nothing I can do. We called on the way and somebody said it's okay. Let me see what I can do. 'If you are good looking, most girls can't handle it.' 'But guys will drool away!' Atta boy! Way to go! Sorry, ma'am. Yeah, it's right here on this side. This way, Ms Thenn-mozee. Is everything alright? -I'd actually ordered for some Indian food. So, you don't want this? -No. I want this. Can I have that also, please? -Yes. 'Done behaving like a greedy pig!' 'That's okay. It's once in a while, right? Cheers.' Sorry. You, okay? 'Oh my God!' Need help? 'The most handsome man in the world...' 'When he's seeing you for the first time, will you be throwing up, you idiot?' -'Please don't even look this side.' May I? There's a pressure point here. Press it down and you'll feel better. 'Hey, don't do this to me!' It will hurt a little. 'Oh, so you also know that I'm Tamil' You will feel better. Trust me. 'Whatever happens, please don't let go of my hand.' A few seconds more... Better? -'Please don't let go.' Good. Get some rest. 'Hey... Who are you?' Are you a doctor? Who, me? No chance of that! 'Hey... handsome...' 'Disgusting. Me!' 'Love and nausea... Sounds good' 'But, in Tamil, it would sound terrible...' 'Love and vomiting!' Is everything alright? -Yeah. How do you know that I speak Tamil? If you're named Thenmozhi(Sweet language), you better know Tamil! By the way, Sathya... Sathyadev. Hi! Even when your eye makeup was messed up, your face looked beautiful. No matter how sick you felt, you had to get yourself to look good. 'What exactly is happening here?' I'm a girl. Whether I'm beautiful or not, I should look presentable at least, right? Yeah. Maybe you're right. Ms Thenmozhi... I have a confession to make! 'He's going to say, I like you.' 'It's going great. Please don't spoil this.' I held your hand and mentioned a pressure point, right? I really know nothing about all that. I just tried it out. Because I know its all in the mind. But, it worked, I guess. Yes. It worked. So, I guess it's okay. I'm not going to call the pilot and complain. Thank you. When you said you had a confession to make... I thought you are going to say, 'You are very beautiful. I like you.' Thank goodness! The first second, I saw you, you were throwing up in a bag. How could I have said, you are beautiful and that I like you? Just joking. Sorry. No, that's true. 'That was it. After that, he went about his work.' 'Was at his iPad.' 'He didn't say anything else.' 'A smile now and then. That was all.' 'I was constantly aware of his presence next to me.' 'There was only one thing on my mind...' 'What a handsome man...' "Is today the good day you made me bow?" "He made me plead for his heart What a delicately intricate art!" "If I extend my hand and touch... If just a speck falls as such..." "Will he melt away like a mist drop?" "Will I wake up from my dream?" "Standing so far away, how could he tickle me so?" "Wafting as a divine incense, he makes me lose my breath" "Standing so far away, how could he tickle me so?" "Who shall I tell about what I admire?" "As I pinch myself in this secret dream, My heart slips away, gently" Hi, baby. Yes. Sweetheart, I know. 12 missed calls. If I could have spoken to you, I would have, right? Okay, sweetheart. I'll see you soon. I love you. Bye. 'Is this the reason I got upgraded from Economy to Business?' 'Two 'baby's and two 'sweetheart's!' 'A 'da(rling)' to boot!' Tomorrow 4 pm? Where shall we meet, sir? Coffeetearia 'Thenmozhi, looks like this is a goner!' Where's Richard's team? Hello, sir. -How are you? All well? Hello, sir. -Hello, sir. Richard? -Sir, he's there. Hi, Sathya. How was your flight? -Okay. Some turbulence. Nah! These days, the risk is not in flying. The risk is in entering the airport. As of now, this has fallen down 28 times. What's the guarantee it won't fall again? That's why I'm wearing a helmet. That's why, it's called falls(false) ceiling! Oh my God! Hello, sir. The second house on the left. At any second, anything may happen. Be careful and watch her like a hawk. What is a hawk, sir? It means 'crow'. The problem is not with you. It's your school! Boys, I'll say it in a way you can understand. Watch with eyes at the back of your head! But then, it may look blurred. I should blame my school! -Sure, sir. I'll get going. Sir, why aren't you married? Because I'm scared of ghosts! Love and that sort of thing? I'm also scared of devils! Why is it not on silent mode? Tell me, dear. I'll be late for dinner. Who is it on the phone? -'Thanga Pushpam.' GF... Golden Flower! May I talk to you or are you busy? Thank you. This is not a coincidence. On the flight, I overheard you fixing a meeting here. I don't know if your meeting is over or yet to start. Yes. It's over. Google... I googled you. I found out a little bit. I wanted to know a little more about you. I remembered youd be here. So, here I am. While talking to you on the flight... you didn't seem like one who talks in circles. Then, I'll come straight to the point. You are the most handsome thing in the world... My darling... My precious... All mothers say this to their sons. Even though they know it's a lie. But your mom didn't lie. I like you. But first, I need to know a lot more about you. You look good. Really good. But I want to know if that is all there is to you. I want to know if you can be my man of honor. For that, I need to have a cup of coffee with you. I'm not saying right now. But sometime soon, have a cup of coffee with me. That will tell me if we can be good friends. Once we're friends, there'll be dinners, lunches and more coffee. From that, I will know. What will you know? Whether I can live the rest of my life with you. As of now, just that cup of coffee. I don't know about the rest. Theres a good chance you'd be disappointed. Just disappointment, right? I'll handle that. Had you ordered a tall glass of cold coffee that would have been good. A gruesome murder is about to happen. Watch if you choose to or close your eyes. If you want to film it on your phones, I give you my permission. Victor... Giving a speech, are you?! So confident, is it? Go! Go! Oh no! I think we need to get to a hospital. Stay with me. Who is he? How is he everywhere? I met him for the first time, in jail. What are you saying? Thirteen years ago. Sathya... Are you alright? Yeah. Completely. Don't worry. And you? Are you okay? You said coffee, lunch, dinner You must have decided against all of it, I'm sure. If I hadnt come there, you would have left. Nothing would have happened. It's all because of me. Yes. It's because of you. They came there just for you. They were looking for you. But one guy there was looking for me. For the others, you! A little bit like 'Two birds with one stone'... I don't understand. Who are they? Why should they come in search of me? Don't be afraid. You must be with me, at all times. Else... ...you must stay where I ask you to. I like this. You don't know who these guys are. But I know a little bit about what they can do. Wasn't our meeting on the flight a coincidence? How do you know all this about me? Just three phone calls and I got you to sit next to me. You... You are a police officer, right? No. Can I trust you? That alone, definitely! Okay, this is getting too serious. And that's not in my character description. Serious- thats not me! I have no worries or fears. I'm serious about you, though. On the flight, you were saying, 'baby, darling, sweetheart', etc. If you are married or if theres someone else in your life... ...obviously, I don't want this. I can't. It won't be good. It will be wrong. All of this. That's why I'm asking. You are married, aren't you? I always thought I was married. But, I'm not. ...aren't you both together? So, do you have a child? Is that why you said, baby, darling, sweetheart, everything? A daughter? That means... You are married and have a daughter. Correct? -Wrong. Signal. 'I decided it was better if she didn't know anything about me.' 'But, the questions she asked took me to back to a particular day.' So boring. I'm not selected in the cricket team either. Try again next year. Keep practicing and you'll play better. Seeing you play, they'll invite you on their own, and get you to join the team What, dad? I don't even like going to school. There's no enjoyment, dad. This is wrong, son. If you don't go to school at this age, then no enjoyment for the rest of your life Mom wants me to become a doctor. -Good, isn't it? For that, I need to study so much! You, dad? What do you want me to become? I won't say. Let a few years pass by. Then it will occur to you. Just tell me what you feel. I will show you how to get there. Yesterday on the terrace, what were we talking about? 'With all your heart' Yes. With all your heart. Whatever you decide to do, you must do it with all your heart... ...and work hard. Only then, when you get to my age... ......you'll be satisfied that you are on the right track. 'The sight of him kick-starting the scooter again and again...' '...and breathing life into it, was the last time I saw him.' Sir? What is it? Who are they? Sir, call the police! What are...? 'Fifteen minutes later, his life was taken.' I'm here to take Sathya home. Sathya, come. 'They had wrapped my dad in a cloth and placed him on the floor' 'I've seen a lot more after that.' 'But nothing affected me as much. Not for a very long time.' Do you know what a 'gangster' means? -No. Gangster, man! -I don't. Your dad didn't even knew him. He shot him, just like that. Hey, what is it? Come and eat, Sathya. 'I was thirteen and all I wanted was revenge.' 'There were many more, like the man who killed my dad.' 'I wanted to make sure I killed each and every one of them.' 'Or...' 'I wanted to become one of them.' 'It's a very thin line.' 'If I'm on this side, I'm a good man.' 'If I cross over to the other side, I'm a very bad man.' 'There came a time when I had to choose between the two' 'I finished school.' 'The days just flew.' 'After that, my mom never asked me to become a doctor' 'Five years later, she wasn't alive to ask anyway' 'Life made that choice for me and changed me into someone' Are you Sathya? That depends on who is asking. Im Victor. You may ask. Are you in Mathew's gang? Asai Thambi's men will try to kill you today. Be alert, okay? Oh! So, it is true! Eight men to kill me? It's been eight months since I saw her. Wait and watch how she reacts now. Sathya, come. -Who is this? I'm your fan, boss. "Come, dearest, come! Is she your darling?" "A 'No' to all of us, I guess. You make our hearts sting!" "Come, dearest, come! Is she your darling?" "A 'No' to all of us, I guess. You make our hearts sting!" "Awright, what's happened's happened!" "Why make any trouble? That's a great looking couple!" "Pull up your lungi... It's getting dusty through!" "Pull up your sari... Your hip is in view!" "Pull up your lungi... It's getting dusty through!" "Pull up your sari... Your hip is in view!" "All our faded faces are now glowing" "All our miserable folk are now celebrating" Victor, why did you leave him? Sathya, come! Go on! Ask him to dance. "Think you have what it takes?" "All just an empty parade! Don't show me your empty parade!" "Think you have what it takes?" "All just an empty parade! Don't show me your empty parade!" "Now on, everything will work out great!" "Firecrackers will burst without being lit!" "For jasmine scents to waft, won't you come near my home?" "Am I not there to claim your desire?" "For jasmine scents to waft, won't you come near my home?" "Am I not there to claim your desire?" "Why don't you come and dance without lifting your collar?" "Are you ready to whistle and holler?" "Why don't you come and dance without lifting your collar?" "Are you ready to whistle and holler?" "Think you have what it takes?" "All just an empty parade! Don't show me your empty parade!" "Think you have what it takes?" "All just an empty parade! Don't show me your empty parade!" "Vellai, who's setting the stage, In murder and theft, he does engage!" "Vichchu, who's putting up the lights, In dead man sketches, he delights!" "Filthy Raidu, He's a pristine fraud!" "Mayil, who's putting up the tent, Born in a prison, this gent!" "Bala, who's setting the table, He'll do your last rites, so very able!" "John, who's welcoming everyone, In putting a scene, he's second to none!" "Come together you all, small or great Serve them food in the same plate!" "Our friendship is an inseparable pair Like the salt in the air" "Think you have what it takes?" "All just an empty parade! Don't show me your empty parade!" "Think you have what it takes?" "All just an empty parade! Don't show me your empty parade!" "Pull up your lungi... It's getting dusty through!" "Pull up your sari... Your hip is in view!" "All our faded faces are now glowing" "All our miserable folk are now celebrating" "All our faded faces are now glowing" "All our miserable folk are now celebrating" "Come, dearest, come! Is she your darling?" "A 'No' to all of us, I guess. You make our hearts sting!" Greetings, brother. Sathya, come. -Welcome, Victor. Tell me, Victor. I've asked around about Sathya. Complete background check. Hes okay, brother. -Just okay? Not perfect, eh? This was how a cop came with a mic. That's how my friend Arasu got caught. Shall we see where you have that mic? Just lift your arms. We'll see. Salim, this isnt necessary. I've completely checked him. Thats what you meant by a 'background check', huh, Victor? I didn't check him there. Check if you want to. I assure you the mic is not there. But it's where it should be. Hey, sit down... Let him be. How long were you in jail? -Four years. Why? -Cannabis... Cocaine... Marijuana... And for attempting to murder the cop who came to arrest me... Sentenced to four years. But you didn't attempt to murder him? -I did. I didn't check him there. Check if you want to. I assure you the mic is not there. But it's where it should be. Hey, sit down... Let him be. How long were you in jail? -Four years. Why? -Cannabis... Cocaine... Marijuana... And for attempting to murder the cop who came to arrest me... Sentenced to four years. But you didn't attempt to murder him? -I did. Brother, I know him for the past six months. We have become good friends. What say, Sathya? Didn't you say you needed another guy? He drives amazingly well... A whiz! There's nothing he doesn't know about cars. We surely need him. He is the right guy for us. So, Mathew, gentlemen. Father Mathew. A former priest. At thirteen years, he dedicated his life to the church. A 13 year old boy who was dear to him was killed by a gang. Asai Thambi's gang. He took to the gun then. He now reigns over Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Nagercoil, Chennai and Bangalore. 200 full-time dealers work under him. Young boys transporting drug packets to other states. He always has ten men around him. Armed and dangerous. One of the main guys in Father Mathew's gang, is Victor. And, this is Sathya... ...a gangster and Mathew's driver. Sathya, stay sharp. It's coming close. Crash into them! Hey, the ambulance! Take the guy from the ambulance! Hurry up! Kneel down! Surround them. Get the guy wearing prison clothes in the ambulance! Throw him into the vehicle. You get on too. Sathya, go start the car. We brought this dog here for a big shot. He'll be here now. You'll see. Where have you kept it? Tell me. I'll kill you. I'm a soft guy. But do you know about that man? He'll shoot you and walk off. Brother, listen to me. -Hey, tell me! At least you tell brother Mathew. I'll go back to jail. I don't have it. Please ask them to let me go. Hello, sir. -Mathew, where is he? He is there. He is with us. No worries. Victor, come. Sathya, you stay. I'll kill you. Tell us! If you don't tell the truth... Brother! Leave me! I'll give it to you. If we don't find the laptop there, I'll slit your throat! Victor, what's this? Sathya, what are you doing? Sathyadev I.P.S Till my friends get here. Sathya! -Victor! You are the only one with some goodness in you. But even you are a very, very bad man. Seven months ago, when I spoke to you and became friends with you. It was all for this one moment. It was to finish off this Mathew. As a reward for my patience... ...this dog and this big shot are an added bonus. Thank you, Victor. '98 percent of cops throughout their entire careers...' 'don't pull out their guns from their holsters' 'Even if they had, they would not have taken a shot.' 'I belong to the remaining 2 percent.' Victor, did you really bring this guy?! Let me go... Mathew bro! Mathew bro, don't! Mathew bro! This is Sathya. If you happen to see me with them, don't shoot me by mistake! Look closely. It's me. Sathyadev. Its a thin line... On this side, you can be a good man. On your side, you remain a bad guy. You need to cross over to this side. If you are adamant about staying where you are... ...your death is assured... ...before it's due! "Don't look at your watch" "Just move like a second hand" "Look at my eyes when I talk" "Duty is the one forever beauty" "If you are up to something wrong, just flee" "Else fall into my third eye and turn to ashes, as I see" "So safely, they will get home if they reach me" "Even tyrants will tuck their tails if they know me" Hey, DCP! Is this his car? Blow it to pieces! Hey officer! Next, we will come for you! Where are the weapons? I don't deal with cops. Danny told us everything. I dont want any trouble. Forget that we ever met! Krish, the money's here. Give me the guns. Get going. Or, just tell me where Danny is. He is right here. You talk to him yourself! They have given me an entire file about you. Check if it's right! Shall I finish him? Shall I finish him, bro? We'll finish him right here! -Hey! Upstairs. Wait till you get upstairs! "He's not a stone to be weighed" "And not a word you'd expect, I'm afraid" "To tell who he really is, no man has alive, stayed" "The moon is not the only thing which has another face." "The rainbow is not the only thing which has many colors" I can create a hundred fake files like this one. You, police ! "You will never come and clash, if you know me" "If you so desire to clash, Oh no! Dead is what you'll be" At this point, I have three things to say to you. I am in no mood to go up to the eighth floor. Oh yeah! Whats your second joke? You are the snake around Shiva's neck! My second bullet is for you. Sathyadev? Nice meeting you. I'm DCP... -Richard. I have been meaning to ask you something. The episode where you took out Danny single-handedly... ...you had said you wanted to say three things. I know two. What is the third? Did you say, 'Can't trust the electricity. Let's take the stairs'? The world is celebrating Christmas today. Because Im taking you out... ...along with Christmas, for me, today is Diwali too! Wow! Super punch. One minute. -You know who I am, right? Who are you, sir? Sathyadev... Aren't you in my dad's collection of cops? You'll benefit from this more than us. Let me go. My dad will take care of everything. You are Kameshwaran's son, right? First ask your dad to take care of you! Arrest him. -Sir? Sathya, I feel cops here have quite a mundane job. All this action, pressure and style is for cops only in English movies. Here, just chasing petty thieves and VIP protection. That's all. Boring, isn't it? Do you like your job, Sathya? Its a complete bore... No action, nothing at all! I don't need to remind you, but I will... He's a rapist and a murderer. He has to get off the train and exit via Exit 2. Arun at Exit 2. If he crosses Arun, we have Pandian. If he gets past Pandian, then me. Which auto stand are you from? I'm here on work. Don't bother me. -What? Just, go do your work. Go on. Can we get going, please? I am in a hurry. Sorry. This auto isnt for hire. I need to get to a hospital. Why don't you take another auto? I'm in the middle of something important. More important than this? I don't understand. This is the second auto that's refusing me. God, I'm so stuck! 'In a few minutes, I was going to be responsible for death' 'For a change, I thought I would be responsible for a new life.' 'I got the auto started.' 'In a few minutes, I was going to be responsible for death' 'For a change, I thought I would be responsible for a new life.' 'I got the auto started.' 'I felt a deep respect for her... from the moment I saw her.' He didn't get past Pandian. Is sir inside? I'm known to him. -Tell me. I'll inform sir... I have come in, sir. Golden Raj here. Greetings, sir. Just get out. You don't even know why I'm here. Why are you getting angry? As if you would have come to discuss social welfare with me? Please sit down, sir. I know that you are under too much pressure. And that they are hunting me down. But I heard that if you decide, my name can be taken off the list. I have one crore with me now. I will give you another crore tomorrow, if you do this for me. My daughter is getting married. Hey, come here. If I get arrested, that will be a huge problem at all ends. I'm the girl's father. So, please consider. There is no pressure on me to take you out. We are out to get others. You are collateral damage. That's all. What does that mean? You can call it, 'unavoidable wastage'! Unavoidable...? Don't mess with me, Sathyadev. I am the one hunting you. You killed ACP Pandian in Madurai. It's your men who sell drugs outside all colleges and schools. -No. I know. Thats why Im after you! Alright. I have brought money with me here now. I can give you more tomorrow. I'll take care of you. Don't get me wrong. But even if you take risks all your life and how ever hard you work... You won't even earn what the smallest guy in my gang earns! I know this very well. Whenever you want anything, ask. I will provide for you. I have a lot of money to spare... Just let me go now. That's all I ask. This makes me wonder They said you are worth nothing. Who said that? Even a dead elephant is valued at one crore rupees. You know that, right? Do I look dumb to you? Which of the two of you have mics on you? Where's the camera? Or have you asked news channels to follow you? Hey, no! You can't be trusted, Raj. Take off everything. Prove that you have nothing on you and I'll take the money somewhere else. Is that so? First, start stripping. I can't watch this crap. My sentry will come in here. After he checks you, I'll let you know. Selvam... You came late today, didn't you? Here's your punishment! Sir has asked you to remove your shirt, pants, everything. You too. Show me, sir. Sir, he doesn't have anything on him. What are you doing, Sathyadev? Who do you think you are? You come to my house and try to buy me out. This is what you are. You are nothing! -Sathya! And I'm a police officer. DCP Sathyadev. Not a pimp! I said I'm not someone like you, a hustler, who rapes the law! The government pays me well. I have a home and a car and I'm happy. Those who work under me get promoted when they are with me. They are loyal to me. But those with you... ...get a promotion only if you die. They are all waiting for you to die! Hey! My father earned lesser than me. But after he died, today I'm a DCP. But if you die, your children will roam the streets as orphans. They will roam around without any hope. Selvam. If you stay here for another minute... ...Ill take your head off. Now, get out. I said, get the out! Do you know who youre messing with? Sathyadev! Go! Get lost! I will come at 12 tomorrow and arrest you myself. Get out! Hey! Let's go. Thats a lot of money, son! A lot of people will come like this. I'm just following my heart, dad. Just like you said. And not just that... You are always with me. Then, how can I take the money? What I'm saying is, the apartment was bought with your money. It's registered in Murali's name, but the bank statement... But I don't want anything else. He didn't ask for her custody. She is all I want from this marriage. I'm happy, Manoj. I'm going to walk away from here happy. Promise you. I could have argued that point. But you said no. I thought that might be useful to you. Anyway... I thought these things happen only in Tamil movies. But in real life too! From an auto driver to a top police officer! In two years, that too Wow! -Really? The very next day, I saw you on TV, at the hospital. You were standing in your uniform. Is this her? -Esha. Hi, baby! You are one of reasons she was born safely that day Not me, I swear. -Come on. "My love... My life" "My elixir, come near me" "The moon plays with white clouds and the dark night" "Throwing her eyes on mine, plays this girl-moon" "My dear, I shall not part from you" "I will never ever forget you" "My love... My life" "Here I come, near you" "I dreamt of my eyes seeing you in a night without sleep" "It was your journey that weighed on my eyelids and my sleep" "My love, I shall never part from you" "I shall never ever forget you" "It is you I want, my pure one!" "I just can't take my eyes off you!" "Shall I gather pearls and diamonds, a cartload?" "Shall I give you the sky up there, as a little gift too?" "It is you I want, my pure one!" "I just can't take my eyes off you!" "Three crore Gods in heaven and three Goddesses of the Trimurthi..." "...shower their heartfelt blessings and grant boons to you..." "...to rule the world, and to live with fame..." 'Wondering if I'll get to meet her...' '...like a seventeen-year-old boy.' "Long live the couple, with unending bliss!" Congratulations. It was a really good performance. Can I say you danced beautifully? Thank you. -Truly. I enjoyed watching the performance. I have a new found love for dance now. No. I'm not going to take up dancing. Neither will I ask you to teach me to dance. Don't worry. But I think I'm going to be sitting in on many dance shows. I've also heard... ...that you don't take money to teach dance in your dance school. In fact, I heard that you paid your students for this show. That's very commendable. You can even call it arrogance. If I start charging my students to teach them dance... ...no student will come. No one in the world has that much money to give! I'm sure. Im Sathyadev. I know. I'm Hemanika. I know. You must be busy. They are waiting. I'll see you later. Richard, I need someone's phone number. Can you get it for me? Sure. Tell me the accused persons name, city, postpaid/prepaid or something. Hemanika. -Why is Hema nika(standing)? Ask her to sit down! Hemanika, the dancer. Hemanika, the Bharatanatyam exponent. You mean, her? -Yes. And tell me, why do you need her number? Planning to learn Bharatanatyam? No, no. A kid next-door wants to learn Bharatanatyam. That too, only from her. That's why I asked. There's a kid next-door to me and she is learning dance from her. I've even given her a ride there many times... Man! This guy! Let's do one thing. Give me your neighbors number. I'll give it to my neighbour and the two of them can contact each other. No, let them talk to her. Her number alone will do. In the end, the accused is this chap. What was that? I will get the number for you in five minutes. Thanks. "It's going to pour heavy" "It's drizzling already" "What am I to do without getting drenched?"

Everyone's talking about us, right? -Look... I love you. I want you. I want to be married to you. That's all. Esha... Esha. No matter what, she is another man's child. If we have kids of our own tomorrow... You are making me cry, Hema. And only you can do that to me. Sathya, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Esha is your child. She came from you. That means she's mine too. She became my Esha, a long time ago. When you gave her to me, for the first time, that day in court... Right from then. From sixth standard, The Fountainhead school. We need to apply every week... We need to go stand in queue. We will stand. Together. Once she finishes school... ...if she says she wants to go study abroad... ...we will first try and stop her. If she is stubborn about it... ...we'll save money, a little at a time, right from today... ...and we'll send her to study. I just have my salary. You know that, right? I don't take anything else. And I never will. So, I need your help too. Which is why I'm telling you... I've chosen a plot on ECR... It's a little remote... We should buy it. It's not worth much today. But after fifteen years, it will be worth a lot. We will spend our retired life there. Looking at the sea, singing 'the sky sings me a lullaby'... And then, Esha will come with her kids and stay with us. I have planned that much ahead. But, you... Did you notice that I mentioned no one else? Because we don't need any other kids. Esha alone will do. Sathya! Just because I want you, dont think I will say anything now. I promise. We don't need any other kids apart from Esha. Just that we need to keep running to the pharmacy. That's the only thing. There was a guy... Ive even forgotten his face He didn't even wait until she was born. But, you... -That's why Im telling you. Say 'yes'. No use talking to you anymore. I'll see if there are any elders around. Baby girl... Esha, my love... Can you please tell your mom...? Ask her to marry me. That will do. Are you sure? -Of course. No, you need to get ready too. She won't leave you alone even for a minute. That's why I like her even more. All I need is twenty minutes to get ready. Before she gets up, I will be ready. You will take two hours at least, won't you? Let her be with me. Are her clothes in there? And shoes? -Yes. She'll be fine. If you wake her, that will do. She'll take care of everything else. Good. I'll bring her. Sure? -I want to. I'll see you tomorrow. At the wedding. What is it? Tell me. I want to be with you. From now on... I want to live with you. I don't know if I can wait. Even till tomorrow? I can't wait, Sathya. One half of me is with you. Take the rest of me too. Take us both. Sir! Can I take Hemanika...? He went to bed a long time back. Even otherwise, do you need permission? Good night. -Bye. Sleep tight. -Thanks. Hello? Tell me, Thulasi. Esha baby, please stay in the car till I come back. You'll be okay? Multiple injuries, cuts, slashes, all over the body, sir. The same thing with her father. Multiple slash wounds. They have dragged his body and left it here. We will wait outside, sir. Please take your time. One half of me is with you. I want to go to mom. 'How do you tell a six year old child, who has no one...' '...that she will never see her mom again?' 'How do you tell her that her mother is dead?' Esha baby, my sweetheart... You must try and understand what Im going to tell you, okay? Mom isnt coming back. She's gone very far away. Both mom and granddad. After handing Esha over to me... Asking me to take care of Esha... ...Mom has left. But she didn't tell me. If she had told you, you wouldnt have let her go... That's why. But, isn't the wedding today? Yesterday we had that function. She left after that, is it? "Somebody's getting married..." "Mom's getting married..." "Esha is so lucky." That song, we sang yesterday? So there isnt going to be a wedding, is it? What do I tell you, Esha? Mom says you should never lie. There isnt going to be a wedding. Mom isnt coming back. She won't come back. 'She clung to me.' 'She never left my side.' 'She didn't say much.' 'But the way she was with her mom, she was with me the same way.' 'I wanted to go out and find the man who did this and bury him.' 'But I couldn't leave Esha.' 'I decided not to go too.' 'Hemanika never left her.' 'I was always with her.' Hello. -Sir, it's the Victor Manohar issue. He's still in jail. It seems there was an attack in jail. But he survived. For the past ten days, he has been in the ICU at GH... under police protection. We've confirmed that he was in a critical state, at the time of her death. He is getting released only next month. He is in jail for killing a cop. Thank you. What? Are you scared? -Yes. Am I not there? Sleep. Come, Richard. I'm stepping out. It will be two hours before I get back. Take care of her. Do you know what time it is? Why? If you go now, your mom won't open the door? Come only after I ask you to. But, why? -Please get going. Hey, follow them. All of you get going. No one needs to stay. I'll take care. Your fight was with me. Why did you take it beyond me, to my family? Big mistake, Raj. Very big mistake. Hey! Who did you send? Or did you come yourself? Tell me. Sathya... You are working from your heart. But you should be working with your head, is it not? Lets say it was me, you think I'll tell you that? You will shoot me, just like that and walk off. I anyway came to shoot you just like that, even if you don't confess. No way! Then, how will you know if I did it or not? Don't you want that girl's soul to rest in peace? Finish him off, guys. Where is Sathya? Hey! Shall we see who's going to end up dead? 'In the end, I had made a huge mistake.' 'What Golden Raj said that day, was true.' 'That day, I shouldnt have followed what my dad taught me.' 'I made Esha wait for me.' 'I was going to make her an orphan and that was a huge mistake.' 'I saw my entire life change again that day.' I know about your girl. I know about her girl too. You had asked your men to check if I had any link to the girl's murder. I know that too. After performing the last rites in Dhanushkodi, you are now in Madurai. Sangam Hotel, Room no. 203. I knew that you were coming for me. And that you will come here for me right now. I know everything about you, Sathyadev! All this information was given to me, by one of your men. I can't tell you who he is. You won't ask either. Because, you are a gentleman. Here, take this. I could have killed that girl and made you cry. That's ordinary... But that's not my style at all. You must die. You must die knowing that your death is because of me. That's my style, Sathya. Now, die! Why did he go? One half of me is with you. He would never leave without telling me. Come on! 'As the world went dark, it occurred to me...' 'It wasn't just one half of her... All of her was with me now...' 'It was in that moment, that I saw her for the last time...' TamilTorrents.Net 'The reason I was saved... The reason I was alive...' 'It was because of her... It was for her.' 'I understood this the moment I saw Esha.' I was everything to her and she, to me. I don't want her to be my weakness. That's bound to happen. This is the only way I know to do this job. I have never been afraid of anything, sir. That's how I did my job. The day I let fear take over... ...I must no longer do this job. No, Sathya. Not possible. Ask for something else. Give me this table. A table just like this. 'Administrative post, desk job, control room...' '...I was fooling myself.' 'I've jumped over a table and shot from behind it.' 'I remember very clearly.' 'But, I couldn't sit behind a table. ...couldn't stand behind it.' 'Couldn't handle it!' 'This is the only way I know to do this job.' 'I can't do it any other way.' 'I walked away, one day.' 'I decided that this next chapter of my life, would be for Esha.' 'She was all alone in this world, because of me.' 'But, not just because of that.' 'I didn't lie to you, Hemanika.' 'She had become my Esha a long time back' We'll go on a long holiday during your next summer vacation. Let's take a long journey... from here to the Himalayas. If you want to experience the colors of life... ...step beyond your books... You must travel, visit new places... meet new people... And this will teach you the most important thing in life. You will understand who you are. Self-realization. Esha, come. We are going to go on a train ride. You will tell me where. This is the map of India. Wherever you point to on this map, that's where we'll go. 'This journey was in memory of the man with whom I had shared these dreams with.' 'So I took off on this journey, as a father and as a son.'

It's more than 24 hours now. I haven't received a ransom call. I know this isn't about the money. I have made a police complaint and they are investigating. It's been two days now. I'm scared. I heard that you're back. I thought of asking your help. Can you do something please? Please, man. Nilanjana? She's fifteen, right? She was taken at the Egmore Railway Station. We were going to take the train to Coimbatore. It was really crowded. My wife and I were on the phone. Our younger girl, Anjali was walking ahead. Of all things, with a wretched taxi-driver, I was haggling on the phone! Suddenly, we realized she wasn't there. In a matter of seconds. I informed the police there and made a scene. I searched all over the station... I kept shouting her name out. But nothing happened. Who's the investigating police officer? ACP John Arumainathan. Do you know him? I'll ask around. I'll make a couple of phone calls. ...don't just make a phone call. Hey! I know who you are and what you can do! Help me. Please, man. Please! Dad, what happened to Nilanjana? Shall we find her and bring her home? 'I entered a world I had been away from, for over four years' 'To ensure my Esha was safe...' '...suddenly one day, I was not a cop anymore.' 'Today, my friend's daughter was missing. For her, once again...' 'Back to who I was... Almost' 'With my police shoes on.' Hello, sir. -I'm looking for a girl. What's this, sir? When you were a cop, I tried to tempt you with so many girls... A girl I know. They took her at the Egmore railway station. Do you know who it could be? Who works the Egmore area? 'Y'. -'Y', as in? 'Why this Kolaveri, di?' He's one bad ! I think it should be him. 'A good cop always knows where to walk the beat...' '...and who are the right guys to talk to.' 'Sorry. A good ex-cop knows' 'Only if you lower yourself into the sewers' 'Why this Kolaveri, di'? -Is he dead? I'm looking for him. -It must be him. Where will I find him? Did he come here in search of you? Or in search of me? Whom does he sell them to? Kodambakkam Sami. Swami... -Tell me, 'Y'. What happened? -It's possible only tomorrow. Tomorrow? -Yes. Tell me, Richard. -At the far end, on the last bench, in blue jeans... ...saffron shirt, a red thread around his neck... ...talking to a guy who looks like crap. He was showing him something on his phone. I tried to see what it was. It looked like a photo... But I couldn't see much. I think the phone was made in China. What sort of look is this?! What's this knot for? Looks like you'll give us away! Sir, the half-boiled's ready. Do you need salt and pepper? 'Salt and pepper' is already here. Now stand back and watch the action unfold. Cheers, son. I work as a security guard at the building, next-door. All the time, it's chaos in this place. Filled with thieving scoundrels. There's trouble every single day at this wine shop. Son... The girl you kidnapped from the railway station! Where is she? You showed him a photo, didn't you? Where is that girl? She's the one, boss. I didn't do a thing. Even if you want to, you can't! You should never be able to do this! Nobody should! The next bullet will blow your head off. Tell me where that other girl is. It won't happen. Nilanjana! I panicked seeing you the other day. I called Kantha yesterday. They came and took her blood test yesterday. Just two minutes ago, they came over and took that girl away in a white BMW. Why did they need the blood test? I think it's for her heart. I don't know if it's for her heart or her liver. But they will operate and remove it. Richard. -Tell me, Sathya. Nandanam Slum board Colony One man is badly injured. Another has been shot and wounded. Before they end up dead, please send your men to look into it. You ! Didn't I ask you not to call? Sir, we are checking drunken driving. We are here, dear! My daughter is asleep. Where are you coming from? Who is it? From Nandanam. Where is your home? -It's here. On Luz Church Road. White BMW X6. Did it pass this way? -Yes, sir. Just now. They went straight. Elangovan, sorry I'm calling this late. Elangovan, please take that girl to the hospital. She was kidnapped. And she has been drugged too. Please handle this carefully. -Okay, sir. I'll take care. If there's any change, I'll call you. -Sure, Sathya. Give her another one. Let her sleep another half hour. What happened? We got a call saying that it'll be done today. I've informed sir. He asked us to find out what's happening. No, we found a match... We tested her last night. You can ask him to come over. She looks like she's only fifteen. Will this work? Isn't that other girl here in three days? Thenmozhi. From the US. 28 years old. We'll wait and finish it. We have a week's time, don't we? What if she doesn't take the flight? She has to come from America. She has to get here. We have to kidnap her. Didn't Victor say she can be kidnapped en route, in Dubai? That's better for us too. Dubai is like sir's backyard. He said he'll cover her up in a burqa and get her out. But, luckily, this girl fell right into our lap! Will we assemble everyone, if not? Victor has arranged for everyone to be here Three doctors, a heart surgeon, Anaesthetist. The entire team is getting ready. If not, what are we to do with this girl? I only said we don't want it. You do whatever you want with her. Why don't you just remove everything and keep it? You are in this business, aren't you? Let's go ahead with this girl. It's the right match. -You think so? Ask him to come. Doctor, get everything ready. One heart parcel, to go! Sir, everything is ready here. 'And that's when all hell broke loose.' Who are you? -Doctor. Huh? -Dr Sathya. Victor knows me. ID? I don't have my ID. I've left it at home. But I know Victor. I do. I'm a heart surgeon. I'm a doctor. Victor said, 'Everything's ready. Just waiting for the patient.' Call Victor if you want. 'Had he made that call...' Go straight ahead and take the stairs. Who is this? -A doctor... Not a doctor, you fool! A cop! Hey you , who the hell is he! Victor, I think it's a cop. I'll handle this. No! No! If you take another step... Is this why you became a doctor, you ?! Unplug her! I'm taking her. Now! Good response, officers. Thank you for coming. Yes, Sathya. I worked with the help of the police force. DCI Richard and his team. This was a parallel private investigation. My apologies for that, with all due respect to all you fine officers. This is an illegal, lethal organ trade racket. They even have foreign doctors. This doesn't involve voluntary organ donors. Neither are they stolen from victims. Here, people are killed for organs. Victims are being kidnapped and killed. Ma'am... I'm sorry. Your daughter needs a liver transplant. I know it's not easy. But we'll try our best. Hey, how are you? -I'm fine. Want to come with me? I'll get you good food. Come. What's your name? -Sundari. Have some ice-cream. One crore rupees. We have a matching liver ready. But who is the donor? This is all legal, ma'am. We have a separate system in place. There's a willing donor who is a perfect match. But as they requested, I can't give you any more details. You have little time. You must take the decision now. The man running this show is Victor Manohar. Many of you may not know who he is. I know him personally. His records will be available in SCRB. After then, I'm seeing him only now. Can you pull out those records of Victor? Sathya, super! You are outstanding! Why don't you take a seat? They were talking about their potential next victim. A girl. Name's Thenmozhi. I heard them talking about this girl. 'She will be here in four days...' '...As soon as she reaches, we'll get her', was what they were saying. Someone somewhere is waiting for a heart. We only know two things about this person: They share Nilanjana and Thenmozhi's blood group. Arasu, his representative. His car and license-plate number. You want to live, right? Or, ready to kick it? I have a desperate desire to live. I'll give you a number. His name is Victor. They do this as a sort of brokerage. Human Organ Transplantation. Hello, sir. He told me that you have a good match. Shall we do this? I should have no problems on my end. I'm doing this to live. If this becomes a huge issue , I might as well die. A girl... She's currently not in town. She's in America. It will be ten days before she gets here. Once she returns, we'll kidnap her. We can then have the surgery in two days. Listen, Victor. The girl whose heart we are borrowing... What's her name? Thenmozhi. I found that they kidnapped my Nilanjana in place of this Thenmozhi. Now they don't have Nilanjana. Just for today, the programme's cancelled. Are all those arrested kept in D-1 now? -Yes, sir. Two injured and two with bullet wounds have been admitted in GH. Get information about Victor Manohar from those men. Sir, I had to use my gun. I tried very hard not to use it. In fact, it was a constant chant in my head. But this guy called 'Kolaveri'... If you'd been dealing with him... ...know how they say, 'I shot him in the spot'... Well, you would have shot him right there. But in spite of being angry... ...I shot him a little above the mark. I fired six rounds on the whole, sir. This is my gun. Sathya, the meeting is adjourned. Gentlemen, thank you very much. You need to request leave from work. For a few days... Just for a few days. Till I die? When we're there with you and as long as we're there, won't happen. Does he know her? Does he know all the girls we are targeting? I don't understand. He knows me. That's why he was sitting there. He must have seen me there. He came to the nursing home, didn't he? That's why all this. Yes! All okay, Sathya? -Pain... That's all, Richard. Nothing more. Our boys should have caught him. They missed him. He was quick. In such a crowded coffee shop... ...how can anyone try so openly and blatantly to kidnap someone? He must have seen me with her. Or he must have been informed. That's why he came in there, so boldly... Guess he was trying to make a statement. He will come again. So, Richard... Thenmozhi... So, this is Thenmozhi? Hi! I'm 'Revolver' Richard, DCI, working with Sathya. Are you Amitabh Bachchan's relative? -No. Then, maybe Abhishek Bachchan's? -Why do you ask? Going by your height. I'm 5'10. 5'10? My God! Check if the traffic has cleared in Adyar. I need to go there now. He's always joking. -Sorry. Just joking. Thank you, Richard. Let the core team be here. Let the others leave. I'm home. So, it's okay. Hi, sweetheart. -What happened, dad? Nothing, baby... -Promise? Promise. She is my 'baby', 'darling', 'sweetheart', everything... Esha. Esha, this is Thenmozhi. Hi, Esha. -Hi. Esha, Thenmozhi will be staying with us, for a few days. She has a small problem. We need to take care of her. Is it okay? Of course. Dad, come on! -Sure?

Cops swarming everywhere. My life's hanging on a thread here... ...and you're busy romancing your wife at your beach house. Is this going to happen or not? Usually, I pay fully in advance only for the girls I want. And this time too, for a girl's heart, I've given it to you! I'm muttering 'Thenmozhi', 'Thenmozhi' in pure Tamil, like a poet here! The doctor has given me time till 1 tomorrow. Do something, Victor. Just tell me where I need to come. I'll come there, pushing my wheelchair, if I have to. Tell me, now. 23, First Seaward Road, Thiruvanmiyur That's where she is at now. That house belongs to Sathyadev I.P.S Yes, sir. That's right. Heard it was him at that Adyar Coffee Shop. So, is he related to this girl too? No. Nothing like that. -If you need additional support, ask me. I will send across as many men as you need. Silently, take her! Give me some time, sir. You're asking me for the one thing I don't have. I guess I have to sound the death knell... for you too. Victor... What happened? 'I asked the police team to leave.' 'I told them it would suffice if they came back the next morning.' 'I just had two of my sentries with me.' 'Ex-policemen, just like me.' All clear? -Tell us what you need us to do, sir. Go to our place. The wall. If any vehicle comes through our street or even the next street... If you see any movement on our street... report it to me... ...even if you see a dog entering, inform me through the wireless. -Yes, sir. Every half an hour... -I'll wish you good morning, sir. Good. 'I know Victor really well.' 'He will come.' 'He will come anytime now.' 'He will come for her, no matter what.' 'And I was ready.' Just say the word, they'll go. Five men... What do I tell them? Sathya knows me well. He knows I will come for her. We'll go. I'll tell you when. Sir, alert! Sir, a black Scorpio is approaching the house. What do you want, you ? This is such a bad opening. This doesn't look right to me. Looks all wrong. Sir, are you Venugopal? No is here! Leave! Let's just get out of here! They said this was the house. -They are mistaken. And you, sir? -New to town? Oh, you don't know how to read! Why talk to this fellow! -Hey, wait! Don't go! Hey! There's a girl in your house... Send her out! Else, your death is assured, ! No girls at your place that you've come searching here! There is no one else here apart from me. And even if there is someone else here, I'm not sending them out. Come inside and check, if you want. If you find her, take her. But remember, first... ...you need to get past me. In that case, like you said... death is assured. Yours! He seems prepared. Looks like he has more of his men inside. I'm saying for sure, 'No'! And he is wearing a 'bag' too! I'm leaving! Looks like he wants to die! Let's go. I'll be back, ! I'll come back with ten more men. Let's see how you sleep tonight. You're welcome to try. Didn't he say Venugopal isn't here? Just come! Hey you white , wait I'll be back with more men! 'So, Victor... Is this all?' Don't go to school today. Go tomorrow. -Why, dad? I have to go to school today. Why? -There's a poetry recital and my teacher said I have to come. Please, dad. (Lines from the song) "Think you have what it takes?" "All just an empty parade. Don't show me your empty parade." "Now on, everything will work out great" "Firecrackers will burst without being lit" Tell me, Victor. When are you coming? I'll let you know. Your hair has greyed. Getting old, huh, Sathya? You should know, going by the coffee shop yesterday, whether I've gotten old or not. And yet you ask... That's why you are the man! I agree. You put up a great fight. But one more minute and this would have been over. Yes, for you. It was your shirt that tore, Sathya. When it comes to a fight, a shirt is bound to tear! You resigned from your police job and pushed us all into deep sorrow. Why have you surfaced again? That too, after so long? I mean, it's a good thing. I'm happy too. But, just curious... Is she related to you? No, right? Is she your woman? No, right? Then why, Sathya? An itch! Not the kind you'd assume... A policeman's itch. Understood? -Clearly. I too, am like you. I'm at the far end of that line you mentioned. I didn't listen to you. Because, I crossed that line, a long time ago. If I try and cross over... I can't. That's all. Understood? Loud and clear, Victor. What next, Sathya? Tell me something else. Let's meet. For old times' sake. What you just said, you ! You are the man! Only you! I always liked you a lot. That's why it was such a disappointment. Do you know what all plans I had for us? The fact that I misjudged someone was a huge blow to me. I'm still reeling from it! Still...! I was just doing my job, Victor. Dont talk to me as if you and your men were a bunch of do-gooders. ...noble bravehearts... Every single person in that group, including you... ...were first-class ! -I agree. That's why, I'm going to call you in a while and tell you the same thing. I was just doing my job. I don't understand. I have taken her, Sathya. I don't understand. I. Have. Taken. Her. Sathya. Do you understand, now? Thenmozhi? Thenmozhi? Is everything okay? -Yeah. Sathya! Is everything okay? -Yeah. All fine. Sorry. Who have you taken, Victor? Scared, weren't you? Went and checked on her, didn't you? Or is she sitting right across from you? Talk to me, Victor. -Hey! What do you think I'm doing? If you keep asking me to keep talking, then, I will have to keep going on. Something seems wrong, doesn't it? You don't have that old enthusiasm. Smugness missing... Attitude gone... What happened, Sathya? That's exactly what I'm thinking about too. Let me tell you what it is. Don't these cops usually trace phone calls? Also, we've been speaking for a while. Didn't you get a trace done? Because, if you had... ...you would know exactly where I am. In ten seconds, I will hang up. In 30 seconds, what I said, 'I have taken her, Sathya'... ...will ring in your ears! I'm talking to you from the Fountainhead School. Wait to hear from me again, Sathya. Check this street. Check if all exits up to the main road are clear. Here's the register. Check all vehicle numbers. Trace the last call I received. Working on it, sir. Will let you know in 30 seconds. We're at the school. Just got here -Is Esha okay? What happened, sir? Is everything okay? All clear there? All clear, sir. Be careful. -Yes, sir. Definitely. Okay. I will send another team to the school immediately. But, this could be a trap, Sathya. So, please don't step out of the house. I'm getting another call. I'll call you back. Tell me, Philip. Trace routed to MRC Nagar tower. Mobilise five people from the DC's team and send them to the school. We need to leave immediately. Make it quick. What's your name? 'No matter what, I shouldnt have sent her to school...' 'That was the only thought in my head...' What happened? Five men, sir. One main guy. They attacked everyone... ...and they took a small girl and drove away with her in a car. What car? -A Ford Endeavour SUV. Are you at the school? -Victor! I'll give you one hour. Bring that girl Thenmozhi... ...to the place I tell you to. After that, I'll let you know where to head to. Come there and take your little girl. If Thenmozhi does not switch from your vehicle to mine... I'll parcel your little girl and deliver her to your home. Victor! Leave everyone else out of this. This is between you and me. The only words I want to hear you say: 'Where do I come?' I shouldn't hear you say anything else. Where should I come? Come near LIC on Mount Road. Give me a missed call on this number, okay? And... Whenever we get the time to talk leisurely... I'll share what the Bharatanatyam exponent Hemanika said, ten seconds before she died. Okay, Sathya? 'All these days, I was clinging onto a sliver of hope... A lie...' 'But the truth is, Hemanika died because I was a good policeman.' 'I couldn't handle the truth that she had died because of me.' Esha... Oh my God! "I heard you asking, 'Where should I come?'" "As soon as we get there, please let me go." "I don't want anything else to go wrong because of me." Please! Thenmozhi... ...that won't be necessary. Arun, the laptop! "Please, baby. Please!" "Let me go. -Don't scream!" "Please leave me! -I'll kill you. Shut up!" GPS Tracker, sir? "On Esha? In her school bag?" In the watch on her hand. Ah! Thank god! This is where Esha is. "They must have switched vehicles on the way." "This is her... from Adyar to Guindy..." "...get a team to see if a white Endeavour is parked and abandoned." "Please keep updating me the tracker position." "Richard, can you assemble three teams- one at Porur, Vadapalani and Airport each?" "Can you check all the vehicles in that route?" "Sir, airport! Car is moving towards the airport." "Richard, the vehicle is heading towards airport." "Okay, done. Call you back." "Where are you heading to, Sathya? -Mount Road LIC, like you said." "Do you have to get to Trichy first before reaching here?" "Or have they moved the LIC building elsewhere?" Like the 'Kannagi' Statue! How come no one told me? "To get to LIC, you should have taken the earlier right." Or, at least taken the right now. Why did you turn left, Sathya? Take a drive to wherever you want. "But, within the next 45 minutes, my vehicle will be parked at Napier bridge." "Thenmozhi needs to shift into that car. That's your job to do." "If she doesn't get in, or if any of your men try to follow..." "...or if there is any sort of police movement there..." ...there will be consequences For both you and your little girl. I have nothing to lose! I don't intend to talk to you again. "But I need to know if you've heard all I said." Just say the words, 'Yes, Thala(boss)'! Understood, Victor. "Sir, what happened? You have stopped?" "Victor's men. Get them!" "This is Kantha. Get him out." "I thrashed you the other day. Remember?" Aren't you the one talking to Victor? "Where is the phone? -No phone, sir." "Sorry, that you have to see some violence. Sorry about that." Break his nose, Arun! "Who is on the phone? -Speak up! It's Victor." "What's happening, Kantha? Why didn't you call?" "He took a turn and I've been following him. There's a lot of traffic." "Where is he, now? -He took a turn at Velachery." "Then through Saidapet, we will get to Nandanam." After that, Mount Road. "Drive past LIC and we'll get to Napier bridge." "I think so. I will let you know if the plan changes." Where are you? Is that so? "I'll tell you. Stay alert!" "Sir, the tracker has stopped. -It could be a signal. Where exactly?" Just ahead of the airport. Lisa, where are you? "On the airport road. Traffic. Should take another half an hour." Kantha is blabbering. I never mentioned 'Napier bridge' to him. "But he said he's following Sathya's vehicle." "And that he will let me know once he gets to Napier's bridge." I'm near the main road at Guindy. He should have driven past me. He hasn't. But he said they were in Saidapet. Something is wrong, Lisa. Sir, the tracker is moving. "It has turned left at the Honda showroom. -There must be subway there." Sir, they have taken a U-turn. Hey, be careful! Don't shoot! Are you Sathya? "Victor asked me to tell you, 'It's bad time for you'..." ...and asked me to hand this watch to you. "Where is my child? Where is my daughter?" Messages delivered alone by Venkat. That's me. I know nothing else. Sir, stop it! Tell me, Victor. Around 10 to 12 cops.... Kantha is missing. "The girl? -She is sitting in the jeep." Hand him the phone. "We are continuously taking risks. Both of us." "You tie this phantom thing on her, thinking it'll lead you to her..." "...and me, waiting for you to come for that." "Somehow, we've come to the same spot." Hey! Where is my daughter? Where is Thenmozhi? I want to see Esha. "Bring her to me. Let me see her." "Handover my daughter to me... and you take this girl." "Hey, there's no room for any negotiation here." You forget your situation! You are wasting my time. "Just hand over that girl to my men there and get going." Your daughter will be sent to you I don't need her after that. "Yes, I do want to take you out. I'll take care of that later." Boldly take the risk, Sathya. We are 15 of my men here. Just 3 of yours. "We'll shoot them down and keep moving." "I will chop her fingers, one by one and keep going." Hey, Victor. "If I don't get Thenmozhi, just a matter of money for me." "After a point, I'd say to hell with it!" But that's not the case with you. Or is it the same with you? I seem to be getting a little doubtful. After all, she is not your daughter. "You never married her mother. That too, because of me." And she is born to another man. "I'm starting to doubt if you will actually come for her." "I didn't really doubt you, this far. But only now." Looking at the way you're behaving! Hey, are you behaving like a worried daddy? "If you want your child, why can't you do as I say?" "Why do you make trouble, ! Are you special if you're Sathyadev I.P.S?" "You won't let go of that girl. But you want your daughter too." "Hey, shall I come there right now? Will you wait for me?" "No need for anyone else. Send everyone else out and I'll come." Let's see if it's you or me. I'll kill you and take her. "Do you want me to come there? -Come!" "This is the only thing you have said right in your entire life." "Don't hide like a coward behind my child. Come!" Hey! What are you doing? I just shot two of your men. "Just listening to your talk, didn't they stand here arrogantly?" "That's why! -Sathya!" "I will cut each of her fingers and send the photos to you." "In the next 20 seconds, you'll get the first photo." "You have Whatsapp? Got a phone? Check that." Alright. Tell me what I should do. That's better, you ! "This is over! Just do what I say. I'll let your child go." "Where is Kantha? Isn't he there?" "Give him the phone! -Arun!" "Kantha! -Yes, sir." "Are they dead? -They are not." He has shot them in the leg. "Sethupathy is fine. Will do." "We'll take the girl and get moving" Leave now. "Victor, one thing. -What?" "We have what it takes, right? Shall I take him out?" One knock! "If we finish him off now, his scene will end." He's been acting too smart. "You fool! He will finish you off with one knock." "Get into the vehicle and move it! -Alright. Leave it." We'll handle him later. They broke my nose! I can leave, right? I'll be waiting for you. She's the right match for our man. "We should have never touched that Nilanjana." That was a mistake. That's how Sathya got involved. "Sir, turn right after the Tambaram bus stand." "When you turn, you'll see a building under construction." It's the only one there. A multi-storey building. They have taken the girl inside. "They are waiting for someone... I guess it's the patient..." Thanks, Sethupathy. "Sir, I will never forget what you have done for me." "We are there. Can we come in?" Hey! Come in. "It's all ablaze here. We are ready and waiting." "Once you come inside, we'll open up the girl upstairs." Just reverse and enter the gate. Open it. "Who are you? -So you are the main villain here!" A heartless man! You , why do you need a heart? Or, is that why? "It's the cops! Escape." Arun, please watch them. "What's wrong with her? -Don't shoot." What's wrong with her? Arun, come here. Keep an eye on her. Where's my daughter? "So it's you? You, traitor!" "Lisa, it's all over. He busted the place with cops." "Sethupathy betrayed us. -Oh no!" Where are you, Victor? I think I've gotten away. I don't know. "Nothing will happen to you. Just stay there." No one knows where you are. No... No! "I don't want to be alone. You get here." Come here! You called me your friend only to destroy me! You must kill him, Victor! 'After all this, if you are still running...' 'This is your time. Finish him!' Arun, don't shoot. -Yes, sir. 'Lisa, I shouldn't have come running to you, the minute you called me.' 'What do I do? You are my weakness.' 'If I didn't yield to your tears...' 'If I wasn't crazily in love with you...' 'If I hadn't come for you, that day...' Lisa, what are you doing? You won't be able to take three steps out of here. Leave her. I'll leave you. You have not cried enough, Sathya. You must suffer so much more. '....you would be alive today.' 'It's my mistake.' 'A mistake that can never be undone.' 'Forgive me, Lisa. Forgive me...' 'Very few cops have a mind of their own and apply it to work.' 'Like you, Sathya.' 'The rest are all...' 'the kind who say 'Command me, master!' Useless fellows.' 'It's been eight days since Lisa died.' 'It's the eighth day today.' 'The fear's gone in these eight days.' 'Not for me. For you.' 'You were waiting for me to make an attack.' 'I know. You were never away from your girl, not even for a moment.' 'Constantly with her.' 'from morning to evening.' 'Three days now.' 'I have sent you back to school, like a little boy, Sathya!' It's early morning for me, little girl! See you soon. Bye. All okay? -They are on a manhunt for him. You will be able to come back soon. This is just a precaution. That's all. A lot of people need you. So, be careful. -I'll try. 'You have sent Thenmozhi off somewhere.' 'I saw the two of you at the airport.' 'But let her go. Why go after some silver, when I have gold close at hand.' 'I'm waiting now.' 'For gold...' 'Not you. Your daughter.' I know you are here. Let's finish this today. Come out, Victor. I know you are here. Let's finish this today. Come out, Victor. What is that in your hand, Victor? Oh! A knife, is it? Just a knife? I will finish you. And your little girl... I will take her away with me. Leave just the way I came in. I'm going to make her a whore... It would be right if you die knowing that she's going to be with me. Too much talking... Boring! Come. 'Do you know whom I'm going to marry?' 'He will hunt you down and kill you'... That's what your Bharatanatyam exponent said... ...when she died. Such a beautiful woman. She's dead and you're already moving on to another girl. Not good, Sathya. Tell me how you killed Hemanika. And this will be over in two minutes. I was troubled... thinking, that poor girl shouldn't have died! Lisa... But now, I feel that wasn't wrong at all. Till the last punch... or until the last man is standing... Isn't that right? Sathya! -Nothing at all, dear. Just 30 seconds. Dad will be with you. Which side wins in the struggle between the good and the evil... ...determines the balance of the world. The balance is now restored... Until someone else, like the man who killed his father surfaces. Hi, girls. Please sit down. It's late. We'll have to leave. Sorry to be a spoilsport. Did you both have fun? Totally. We talked a lot. Right, Esha? We ate a lot, too. If you are free this Sunday, come home. It's Esha's birthday. I know. The party is in the evening. I'll come there at 7 in the morning. Please open the door for me. We have made a plan to spend the whole day there. Okay. Good night. Esha, one minute. -Okay, dad. We have a tall glass of cold coffee pending. I've been waiting for you to call. Good night. We can skip the coffee.
