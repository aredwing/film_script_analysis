Miss Bennett, yesterday in court, you received an order to be paroled into foster care, which made you eligible since you won't tllm 15 fOl' 3 few fTlofllhS. Right? Uh-huh. Don't "uh-huh" her. What? I know you know better. She knows better. Mmm-hmm. Okay, now, Mrs. Daniels, you do understand that as Maria's appointed foster parent, you take full responsibility of this minor? (CHUCKLES) Do l ever'. Okay. That's it. CONNIE: That's it? Yes, it is. Just follow the yellow line down to the exit. And good luck Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you. I was talking to Maria. Connie: All right, follow me. Going to come out here, and we are going to put you to work. Great. Okay. Lets start with these. An right. And let's set a couple of rules. Like what? Like curfew at 9:00, and you're not allowed to hang out with your old crew. You ain't got to worry about that. They ditched me a while back. Any more rules? Well, not a rule, but I would like you to start thinking about your future, Like, what do you wanna do with your life? If it was up to me... Whatever. It doesnt matter. What about your dancing? You used to love that. Look, I got to get a real job. It's not like I can make any money dancing, Excuse me? Honey built this studio with her dance career. We all can't be like your daughter, Mrs. Daniels. Well, if anybody could be, it'd be you. What have you... Give me that! This ain't no mirror cleaning. Now, see, your problem is, you are not motivated, Now, look at that. That is what a mirror's supposed to look like. Mr. Kapoor: No, come on. Please, Maria. MARIA: Oh, come on. Maria, please. Please. What? I don't think you working here is a good idea. Why? You want to hear the truth? I don't trust you anymore. Okay? Mr. Kapoor, you know me. I messed up one time. One time! You know what they say. Once you go bad, you never go back. Wait, no. It's... it's once you go "black," you never go back. But that makes no sense. How can you go... Is that what they really say? Hmm. I'll try to remember that. Besides, Maria, I'm running a business here, not a charity, okay? I'd really like to help you, but I just can't. All right, maybe not. But I can help you out. Right? And how's that? Hey! Put it back. Put what back? I ain't got nothing. Yeah? Damn! How did that get in there? I saw you take the bracelet, too. Hey! Nobody steals from Kapoor! Big Lester, grab him! Grab him! (EXHALES) Big Lester, did you see him? It was just her. Oh, God. These frigging kids. Now, tell me, how did you know she was stealing? When she walked in, I just had this feeling something was up. Mmm. Maybe l could use you here after all. So, I got the job? Yes, but on a trial basis. Okay. If you screw up... Whoop! Outside, okay? Out, yeah. Thank you. Can you start today? (HIP HOP MUSIC) (TURNS OFF MUSIC) I see you ain't lost your sexy. Damn it, Luis. How did you get in here? The place is locked. Since when has that stopped me? What do you want? I heard you were here, and I wanted to see you. Well, you saw me. Now leave. It's like that, huh? Yeah. I thought we could hang out. Maybe catch up. That's what you get for thinking. You still tripping off that stuff that happened? Did you really just ask me that? You need to get out of my face. What did you expect me to do, Maria? It ain't like we would've shared a cell. You did juvie. I would've got real time. Hell, what l got felt real to me. And I wouldn't have even been there if it wasn't for you. So, what do you want me to say? Look, I'm sorry. Oh, well. There it is. It makes it all better now. I didn't come here to fight. I got some good news. What? You heard about the 718? What about them? Well, we won the Dance Battle Zone competition. So? So, I want you to come back and dance with us. Yo, we missed you, and we still got mad love for you. Yeah, I've had your kind of love. And you can keep it. Look, I've changed. I ain't caught up in all that bullshit anymore. I've been straight since you left. No hustling or stealing! I don't believe you. Then let me prove it to you. I know you still want to be a real dancer. I can make that happen. You know what? I think you should leave. Right now. Okay. I won't push. But do me a favor, just think about it. Okay? Goodbye, Luis. (EXHALES) (ALARM CLOCK BUZZING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) CONNIE: Maria! Maria! MARIA: What? I'm up! Maria! Ge! up! All right! Damn. Crazy woman. Ta-da! Is that for me? Of course! But don't get used to it. Now, you may be living in Bay Ridge now, but room service is a one-time only thing. Thanks, Mrs. Daniels. You're welcome. Now, don't you feel bad for cursing me out? Oh, I was having a nightmare, Yo. What? Damn! That's got to be the finest janitor ever. Hell, yeah. And you know what? I think she needs some of this pimping right here, Darnell, don't do this to yourself, man. You got no swag and no chance with that. (SCOFFS) Come on. Watch me, kid. Darnell. I'm telling you, man... Excuse me, sweetheart? All right. (CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me, miss? You are far too fine to be sweeping these floors. What if I told you I could change your life if you just take my hand? Uh.,. What? Can't speak? I'm waiting for the punch line. That was a joke, right? Uh, Awkward. Yeah. Of course. Okay. Yeah. All jokes. I'll let you do what you do. You are the worst. What? You couldn't have did it, man. CARLA: Hey, boys! Hey!

Look, now, I don't know who you are, but you can't just roll up here and harass my crew. She's a thief. I caught her shoplifting. You did that, Tina? Brandon! Who are you going to believe? Me or this janitor? I'm sure the janitor has a name. Who are you? Don't worry about who I am. Just keep your little hoodrat on a leash. CARLA: Damn! I know that chick. Her name's Maria, She used to dance with Luis and them. The 718? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, okay. No, Carla's right. Yo, she was fire. TINA: Anyway. I ain't thinking about them. All right, it's over. Let's get back to work. Word. CARLA: Word.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) BRANDON: Hey. You stalking me or something? Me? Stalking you? Not hardly. Damn, I was kidding, gm. You always this rude, Maria? How'd you know my name? It's on your necklace. Come on, you want to dance? No, thanks. Wow. What, are you scared? Scared you might like me? Or scared you can't hang? I knew you'd come back to me. Not even. Hold up. The crew is here. Come hang out with us. No, thanks. What's your problem? Look, I'm just trying to stay out of trouble. That's all. We did more than just get into trouble, remember? Hey, back off, all right? I'm here with someone. Who? I got to go. Hey! Hey, Do me a favor. What's up? Come on, dance with me. You're kidding me, right? No, Why you desperate all of a sudden? Come on. Really? He'll be back. Hey, whatever. Au right. All right. Come on. Watch and learn this. There you go. Go away. Is everything all right? I'm fine, yeah. Just ignore him. What's wrong? Can't hang no more? I can hang. Let's see. Why you all up in our business? Go find your own chick. That's my girl! No, I ain't. This fool. (PEOPLE CLAMORING) So, are we going out tonight? What? No! Not today, boo. No, no. What you mean? Yo, hey, look, for real. Hey, you're wack. Hey, what the hell was lhai? It was tomorrow's schedule until you made me ruin it. I'm talking about last night when you played me. No, I didn't. I almost got in a fight over you with that fool Luis, and then you bailed on me? What's up with that? It's a long story, and I don't want to talk about it. That's it? Pretty much. Whatever. You owe me. I don't owe you anything. Come with me. I have to finish my board! ...And just all up in my business like, "Who are you?" Yo, what is she doing here? Okay. I want you to show them how you danced last night. You're kidding me, right? No, I'm serious. Do it. What's the matter? Are you afraid to dance? YOU look scared to me. Yo, maybe she can help clean us up. She can give me a bath any day, (ALL LAUGHING) TINA: Just what I thought. This trick ain't got nothing but a big mouth. Au right. Play the music. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL WHOOPING) Damn! That was the business! Damn, boo, you are the truth! Carla, really, you got to stop talking like that to people, What, college boy? I mean, she knows how I meant it. Girls can say that to each other, all right? Lt'S like when black folks call each other "my..." Quit it while you're behind. Baby, stop. Now I've never seen a New York dancer that could turf like that. Did you live in Cali or something? No. I learned it from this girl I used to know. You think you can teach us how to do it? Really? What happened to, "I'm going to break your ass in half'? Yeah, that was before I saw you dance, though. Whatever, Lyric. We don't need her. I think we do, Tina, because I've never seen you get down like that. So, you interested? No, thanks. Why not? You're here all the time. What you got to lose? Is cleaning toilets keeping you busy? I bet she's going Crawling back to the 718. Girl, if I wasn't on probation.. Ooh! What would you do? You know what? I'm just not interested. Hey, what's going on? It's the 718. They're buying everybody slices. When why? They always do stuff like that, Last time, they handed out school supplies. My moms really loved that, but I'd rather have the pizza. You're just in time. For what? What is all of this? What does it look like? We take care of our own, Ma. I mean, if not us, who will? So, this is what you meant when you said you changed? Yeah, part of it. I'm trying to do right, at least. Didn't seem like it last night. Man, I was just having some fun. Hey, did you eat yet? No. Then come inside. Dinner's on me. Thanks, but no. I'm just trying to feed you, I ain't trying to get you pregnant. Okay. But I'm not staying long. MARIA: (LAUGHS) Do you remember your cousin's wedding? Yo, you got so lit. I wasn'l too buzzed to catch the bouquet, though. Right. After you knocked over the old lady and the flower girl. Oh, my gosh, it was an accident! Nobody got hurt. The flower girl lost a tooth, Maria. It was already loose. And I gave her the bouquet to make up for it! True. True. Okay, then. Oh, man. You know, after a while, the DJ wasn't that bad. We danced for a while after everybody left. It was nice, though. I thought about that night a lot when I was gone. Have you thought about coming back to the crew? I'm so tempted. You know how much dancing means to me. Come dance with us tomorrow. I know once we get back at it, it'll be just like old times. That's what I'm afraid of. Hey, you know I got you. (HIP HOP PLAYING) Wow. So, this is where it all goes down. Let's show her how we rock the 718. (WHOOPINGS) (MUSIC STOPS) (PANNNG) So, are you ready to join in? (MUSIC RESUMES) (lvluslc sToPs) (PANNNG) (CREW CHEERING) LUIS: Man, it feels good to have you back. It just seems right. You feel me? Yeah. It made me realize how much I miss being with our crew, Is that all you missed? You know, we could have it all now. I just wish you would've listened to me back in the day, Are you blaming me for what happened? Don't sweat it. We can start all over. (POLICE SIREN WAILS) Yo, we got company. Let's go! Let's go! What are you doing? Hold this. What are you doing? Relax. What up, Luis? What's up, homes? What you got for us tonight? Same thing I got for you every night. Nothing. (LAUGHS) We can play it that way, too. I know you got something. Nope. He's clean. We'll get him next time. The fool is bound to slip up. You must have a thing for losers, huh, baby? You two have a good night. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Are you okay? Bastard! You lied to me! Listen, you don't understand. It's just a side hustle! It's how I'm able to do the good shit I do around here and give back! Don't you see that? They don't care about us. We got to do for ourselves. Me and you. No! Not me. Not anymore. I don't want in. (KlCKS CANS) Hey, Hey, I'll dance with your crew on one condition. Yeah, what's that? We get on Battle Zane and we beat the 718. Wait, hold up. You're trying to use us to get revenge? That, and part of the grand prize is that your choreographer gets an internship. That'S the kind of break I need. Who said you were going to take over our choreography? BRANDON: I mean, we could use the help. Right now, we're just winging it. Her Stuff could push us over the top. Au right, so can we get started? No, see, you're tripping. Audition is at the end of the month. Let's do this. BRANDON; Tina, Lyric. Part of the grand prize is $100,000. I know we could all use that money, but with your grandma's medical expenses, I thought., Why you got to put us on blast? No, I'm not. Look, you know I got your back, always. And if you really don't want her in, just say the word and I'm down. But I think we should do it for Grandma. I do. And if I say no, I'm the bad guy, right? Pretty much. All right, Fine, she's in. CARLA: Yeah! But if she gets in my face again, I'm going to cut her. With what? Your razor sharp wit? My what? I just said yes to you to get in my crew. How's she gonna talk to me like that. All right. Five, six, seven, eight. It's one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, eight. One, two, three... One, two, yep, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You guys got to trust that the guys have your back. And you guys need to turn, and you guys need to know that they're coming. Three and four, five and six, and seven, eight. One, two, four, six, eight, Are you serious? Get up! Ge! up! Carla, pay attention! Whoa! Oh, my God! TINA: This is so Stupid. I'm not into it, right? Yo, can we just stop arguing for two seconds and focus? How are we supposed to know what we're doing if we can't even see? That's the whole point. You guys are using your eyes and those mirrors as crutches. You need to learn how to trust your instincts. Trust each other. Think you can do il? Just turn the damn music on already. Shit. LYRIC: Watch ii! Whoa! (FAST-PACED MUSIC) (ALL CHEERING) That was dope. That was amazing, yo! MARIA: All right, y'all ready to go full out? BRANDON: Let's do it.. Whoo! All right, HD! (ALL WHOOPING) That was dope. I got to hand it to you, girl. You're really getting us there. I feel like we might even have a shot to win this thing. We'll See! We're going to need to come a lot stronger than this, I know that much. Wow! What is your problem? I guess I can't help telling the truth. My bad. Hey, I like what you're doing. Keep it up, and all the haters are going to have left is hate. I appreciate that. Later, y'all. Same time tomorrow, B? Yep. Fire me. Later, D. You got it, bro. Bye, (LAUGHS) Don't listen to Tina. She talks a lot of smack, but she's a good girl. Yeah, it's not her smack talk that pisses me off. I think she might be right. Was Tina right when she said that you're trying to win this thing to get back at Luis? Not just Luis. It's like, most of my life, people told me I'd never be anything. So, what is it you wanted to be? Honestly? I want to be a dancer. And I always have. I think we should go somewhere. Okay. Where are we going? Where are you taking me? You'll see. We're going to get cleaned up. (MARIA GRUNTS) Yeah. Yeah, watch, watch. Whoo! How did you know about all those places? I'm a dance major at NYU. And part of our curriculum is to experience the arts. My head is just busting with ideas right now. All the stuff we could do, like mixing the stuff we saw. You know what I mean? Like, if we go... Barn! Bam! Bam! Bam! You know? (CAR HONKING) Thank you! Do you even realize what you do with your choreography? It's like you're telling this beautiful story. What? "Beautiful"? Yeah, I said it. Beautiful. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Just, if that's the way you step to girls, your game is pretty weak. You might want to take some lessons from Darnell. What? Are you serious? Yeah! Darnell? Okay, I would never do that, first of all. Second, I bet I do know what impresses you. What? What? What are you doing? Yo, yo, what up, Ma? You dig my swagger now? Or you still fronting like you stunting? I'm just saying, shawty. What's a brotha got to do to get with you? You need to quit. Quit what? Quit this? Oh, ay! Ay! Uh, uh! Ooh! Pow! How you like me now? No, l liked you better before, Yeah? Yeah.

Okay, you're going to make me earn this kiss, huh? Oh, yeah. Okay. Your smile. I mean, you don't give it up much, but when I catch one, I just want to make you happy. Oh, Now what? Now, I want you to look at me like I'm the only girl in this world. I've been doing that since the first moment I saw you. Okay. Can I kiss you now? You really need to kiss me now. MALE RJ: It's another beautiful day here in New York City. Let''s heat if up just a little more with Reflejo de Luna. (LATIN MUSIC PLAYING) (INCREASES MUSIC VOLUME) Maria! What are you doing? The tango! I know what it's called. What I want to know is why are you doing it when you're supposed to be working? Mr. Kapoor, you work too hard. Do you know what you need? Yes, an employee who doesn't tango with brooms. No, you need to dance more. No, thank you. I only dance at the funerals of people I hate. Come on! Stop being so grumpy all the time. I'm warning you, Maria. I have bad knees, arthritis and clogged arteries, I'll make it easy for you. Put your hand here. And keep your shoulders straight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. No, that wasn't good. That was good! No, I did shit. You killed it! Hey! What are you doing here? I wasn't expecting to see you until later. Wen, l thought maybe we can get a bite to eat before rehearsals. Okay. And I wan! to talk to you about something. Why? I just found out they moved my finals to the same day as the audition. You have finala in dance? No, I'm a double major. I got dance, and I got business, These are my business exams. I'm sorry. I hate that I have to miss it, Maria. I'm going to be with you guys every step of the way, leading up until the audition. We can do this. It's fine. BRANDON: One, two, three, four, five and six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, four, five and six and seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Perfect. Let's do some miming. Miming You all know what a mime is, right? Are you kidding?

All right, One and two and three and four. Yeah, I mean... When you do it, just loosen up your arms. Like that. Relax them. Who are you shooting? Relax them. This is so stupid. CARLA: Tina, let's just finish it. It's not stupid, Tina. Okay, look, I studied the show. All the past winners are well-rounded. This will help us. Right. And with this new style, it's like we've been dipped in culture. That's one thing I know the 718 doesn't have. Culture. (SOFTLY) Dipped. Dipped in culture. I don't think so. BRANDON: Come on, it's a good thing. This stuff will help us. Come on. Fine. LYRIC: Quit whining. TINA: Stop. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Pick me! MAN: That's it! Let's go now! (CHEERING) I said, "My brothers"! Break it down. ALL: Uh! ALL: A-G-T. Strike step! ALL: Ah! ALL: Get down! ALL: Get down! ALL: Get down! ALL; Lets get funky! ALL; Lets get funky! Welcome to the Dance Battle Zone. (AUDIENCE CHEERS) Number 542? That's us, 542. You're up next. Come on, guys. We can do this. I can't believe they let Luis sit in on auditions. Just ignore him. Let's see. HD Crew, right? You're out of the Honey Daniels Center. Is that what the HD stands for? No. No, it stands for "High Def." Like, clear. In your face. JONAS: Well, Honey Daniels is amazing. Y'all have got some big, big shoes to fill. I could tell you righi now, you're just wasting your time. JONAS; What, you know them, Luis? LUIS: Just her. She couldn't quite cut it with our crew, So l cut her loose. Why you got to lie? Yo, can we get this audition going, or what? (LAUGHS) Yes, you can. I do love the drama, though. Let's do it! All right. Come on, y'all. I'm going to show you. (GIRL SINGING) (HIP HOP BEATS) (ALL LAUGHING) Thank you, but it's a "no," kids. KATRINA: Sorry. Maybe next year. You guys are wack. (LAUGHING) I tried to tell you, Maria, You're just not good enough. And those two new dancers ain't going to save you either. Now, beat it. MAN: Get out of here. Get out. Beat it! No! NO, Sweetie, don't make this difficult on yourself. We're doing it again. JONAS: Well, well, well. Now, this just got more interesting. (MUSIC PLAYING) (PANNNG) Listen, we've decided that because of your dancing and the obvious tension between you and my boy Luis here, that this should make for great television. HD, welcome to the Battle Zone. (ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY) Thank you. Thank you. We did it. That was insane. It was nuts. Not just the way we made the show, but the way you stood up to those judges. I mean, you were like, "Hell no! Y'all are going to check us out!" Okay, I just wanted our crew to have a fair shot. I give you mad props for that. We finally feel like a real crew, you know? And that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you. I respect that. You're welcome. You can take that one to them. I'll get the other one. Okay. Make them save me a slice, though, I will. I'm in. So, where's Brandon at? I texted him. He must still be taking his finals. Finals? He could've skipped those to come celebrate, man. You don't skip finals, bro. That's why they call them finals, The boy is trying to get his edu-macation on. That don't make him any different than the rest of us. We all just want to dance for a living. Yeah, but we don't all have filthy rich parents like he does. What are you talking about? His family owns half Of Texas. You didn't know? His family makes the Hiltons look like the Hammers. (LAUGHING) Can't touch this. Really Really? He's good with kids, too. He teaches a class with kids? Yeah. Once a week. You didn't know that either? What do you know? Let me ask you a serious question. Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone? She just be like... Shake it, baby! Yo, Carla. Check it out. CARLAI Oh, uh-uh. She is about to be sleeping with the enemy. Good stuff today. Thank you. Watching you move was amazing. Stop it. Hey, I'm serious. Tina, is he bothering you? No, he was just telling me how much he liked our audition. No, I said I like your audition. You're the one who brings the heat to this group. Tina, did he tell you that you're too good for us and that you should be dancing with his crew? Yeah, he did, but... Tina, he's trying to play you. Hey, calm down. I told him I would stay with the HDS. Well, good. But you act like I ain't even good enough to dance with them. I didn't say that. Sounds like that's what she's saying to me. MARIA: You know what? Stop starting trouble. Leave our crew alone. Tina, are you going to let her dis you like that? I mean, I know if someone in my crew called me out, we'd battle on the spot. Wow! I am not calling her out. And if we're going to battle, we're going to do it as a crew and take your sorry ass out. And what's stopping you? What's stopping you? (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) See that, Tina? She's scared. She's scared! If you were on the 718, baby, you wouldn't run from nothing. Whatever. Maria, we got to do this, okay? We're finally getting some props, and it's time to back it up. Tina, are you sure? Yeah, I'm as sure as you were in that audition. That's pretty sure. Tina's right. If we aren't going to knock heads, we got to do something. Hell, yeah! That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Mmm? Fine. Let's battle. Yes, Let's go. LYRIC: Yeah, they ain't got shit on us. GIRL: Yeah, baby!

HD, you all suck! That's it! MAN 1: HD, hit the road. GIRL 2: The 718 killed it! MAN 2: Yo, HD is wack! Hit the bricks! Go home. Pack it up. MAN 3: GIRL 2: Go home, HD! You call this a crew? Are you serious? And you actually think you're going to take us out on Battle Zone? (SCOFFS) Toys. Tina, when you're ready to grow up, come holler at your boy. Yo, I was wrong. We ain't no damn crew. We're just some posers. Tina, we tried... But our try wasn't good enough, ain't never good enough! We got humiliated! Nobody is going to respect us after this. Nobody! Wait, Tina! Leave me alone! Tina! Tina! (CROWD JEERING) You're late. Do I have to remind you what time your curfew is? I know what time my curfew is, You know what? We made rules in this house, and they are going to have to be followed. Or what? You're going to send me back to juvie? Fine. What is the matter with you? I'm just sick of trying. I try and live by your rules. I try and stay out of trouble. I try and join a new crew. And nothing works. Well, it doesn't mean you have to give up. Save it. I'm going to bed. Hey, Where you been? Sorry I'm late. I didn't get much sleep last night. What's going on? Tina quit. She said she's not coming back. What the hell? Do you know what this does to our choreography? Of course we do! But I'm... Bun nothing! This screws everything up! Don't take it out on Lyric. I'm not taking it out on Lyric. I'm pissed! So, what do we do? You tell us. You're the choreographer. You know what? I don't need this right now. I'm out. Well, that's messed up. What? A street battle? What were you thinking? Didn't you know losing would ruin their confidence? I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you. I didn't know that Well, you should have. And you should have told me you were just some rich kid slumming it down here for grades. Now, what does my family's money have to do with any of this? Makes it all just a game for you. If things fall apart, you can just leave, buf the rest of us are stuck here to deal with it. In case you haven't noticed, I'm still here. You're the one that walked out. Because it's over! l quit! We can't win without Tina! Fine, If that's the way you feel, then you should quit. I'm going to go up there with my crew, because I believe in us. Maria. Are you okay? Yeah. why? Today's your day off. What can I say? I'd rather be here than anywhere else. Oh, Maria. Let's talk. Let's talk. You got to follow your heart, Maria. Is there a problem at home or with your friends? Both. And this is how you deal with it? Come to work? Yeah. Huh. Good. Why, because you get free labor? Of course. But I was thinking, Maria, instead of getting yourself into trouble, you chose to do something constructive. I like that. Well, while I'm being constructive, is there anything else you want me to do? You go work your register, and I'll take care of this later, You said no one works the register but you, What, you expect me to take your word for it that you were going to change? NO, I had to wait for you to prove it, and you have. So, now I trust you. Thanks, Mr. Kapoor. That means a lot. BRANDON: Five, six, seven, eight. All right. Try it again. Five, six, seven, eight. All right. So, you're back now? Why not I still got to do my community service here anyway. Right. Hey, Hey, look. I want to be here, if that's okay with you. Whatever. Uh-uh. Yo, is that Tina? Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say it, Shit! She joined up with the 718. That's scandalous, man. How's she going to play us like that? Because she only thinks about her damn self, that's how. BRANDON: We can't sweat this right now, guys, MARIA: He's right. We need to focus on this crew. So, let's rock this thing, all right? Bring it in. Let's get an HD on three, an right? One, two, three... ALL: HD! MARIO! Every season on Battle Zone, we find Ihe hottest, most insane crews on the scene, and last season was no different. The 718 set this place on fire with their off-the-chain routines, and at the end of this season, you're going to see them perform against the last crew standing. There's already been some behind-the-scenes madness with one crew jacking another for a dancer, and we haven't even started yet. So, what's jumping off next? Stay tuned, because you don't want to miss Battle Zone. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (LOUD CHEERING) One of these crews is going home tonight. Judges, who will it be? Well, it's obvious that this year's talent is amazing, but, unfortunately, somebody has to go. And tonight, it's Fanny Pak. (SCREAMS JOYOUSLY) Sorry, guys. ALL; (DRAMATICALLY) Ah! Ah, I'm sorry to see those guys go. They were a hot crew. Yeah, but they weren't the best. And you have got to be the best if you're gonna go up against the 718. MARIO: Enough said. We'll see you next week in Battle Zone. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Come on, we just killed it! Yeah, we're still in. We need to talk. No, we don't. Look, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you don't. You need to stay away from Luis. He said you were going to say something like that. Trying to get me back in the crew? Look, he's right, we need you. But more importantly, I don't want to see you get caught up. You don't know him like I do. I know he's my best chance at winning that prize money. Can you guarantee me that? Yeah, I didn't think so, Wait. For what? I ain't coming back to your crew. Then, just be careful. Can I talk to you for a second? What do you want? It'll only take a second. Come on. Whats up? Let me take Tina's place. Right. I mean it. I'll come dance with you if you kick Tina off your crew. What changed your mind all of a sudden? I know what I'm getting into with you. Tina doesn't. And since when did you become a teenage crisis counselor? You know I'm a better dancer than her, and I can pretty much guarantee you another win. That's true. There's just one little problem. What'S that? Come here. Come close. I don't trust you, witch. Ever since you got out of juvie, you've been full of yourself and treating me like I'm something you scraped off your shoe. But, you see that little girl over there? She has stars in her eyes. And I can make her do anything I want. You're a jerk. Do you know that? You used to like it. You tried to fix it, didn't you? You were listening? I had to make sure you were okay. Yeah, I'm good. I just feel bad. Tina being with them is all my fault. No, Tina's stubborn. That's her fault. But thanks for trying to protect her. I just want the crew to go back to the way it was, you know? I do, too. Hey, do me a favor. Don't be mad at me anymore, because I'm too tired to fight. Me too. BRANDON: Yeah, the movie was good, but real talk, could you stop killing us in rehearsals? No, I have to. We've got to make it to the finals. We got to be strong enough to win. You can hang, can't you, college boy? Oh, I can hang. Okay, then. So, say my name. College boy? Okay, say it. (LAUGHS) Okay, okay! Brandon! "Brandon," all right? Are you happy now? Very happy- (GIRL SOBBING) Do you hear that? Yeah. Just wait right here. Maria, come here. Tina, are you okay? MARIA; Hey, what happened? Did Luis do this to you? No, it was his boys. They beat you up? No. Luis told them to walk me home, and then they smashed a store window and told me to grab stuff. And did you? I was too scared. There was glass everywhere. I got all cut up. I'll take her to my house. It's okay there. Okay. Come on. Come on. I should've listened to you when you told me to stay away from Luis. Yeah, well, sometimes you just got to learn the hard way. Yeah, you're right. So, what are you going to do now? I'm not messing with Luis no more. That's for damn sure. Word. Which means I can't dance with his crew either. Right. You think I could come back to the HDS? You know that's not how it works. Yeah. Hey! Owl Are you all right? Yeah. MARIA: All right. You guys already know my vote. I say we let Tina back in the crew. That would be my vote, too, MARIA: All right. Ricky? Well, Tina's my homegirl, so, yeah. I want her back. All right. Carla? Girl, I'm easy. Ha! We know that. You don't! Anyways, my vote is yes. Not because I think you deserve it, Tina, but because l can't stand Luis and his crew. Au right. Well, Tina's crazy. And you know what they say, crazy ass is the best ass. And the best ass is some crazy ass! Then that must be my ass. Hey, guys, not the right time. Okay. Yeah. Lyric, it's on you. Carla was right, you don't deserve it. Every single one of us had your back. You basically spit in our faces. That was messed up. I didn't mean to. I don't care what you meant. I only care about what you did. We were like sisters, Tina. I would've done anything for you. Then you leave me, and now you want to come back like we're all cool? I'm sorry. I messed up. You messed up bad. You're still family, and I'll always love you. But if you want my trust, you got to earn it, Just tell me how. I'll do it. You can start by getting back in this crew, and help us whoop Luis' ass. I might need a tissue. (SOBBING) Damn, I think my allergies kicking in or something. I thought someone was chopping onions up in here, (SOBBING) (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Besides 718, who else we got to look out for? That's hard to say. I mean, some of the best crews from last year will be back. It's not for the weak. (AUDIENCE BOOING) (LOUD CHEERING) We're going to need your toughness, Tina. You mean thal? You think I'd give you a compliment if I didn't mean it? Aw! Aw! All right. Okay! Get off me! That's the business. You guys, come on. You got to loosen up. Those other crews will smell the fear on you, especially the 718. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) MARIO! Join us next week, because you don't want to miss the semifinals on Dance Battle Zone. (ALL WHOOPING) There was this girl when I was in juvie, Julissa, and every time we would battle, she'd always come up with something new, What was she in for? She tried to kill her stepdad. Whoa. why? She didn't say, but we all knew. Was it scary in there? Not in a way you could really imagine or I could really describe to you. It's like feeling alone with hundreds of people around you. What did they charge you with? Breaking and entering. Luis thought he knew his way in and out of a pawn shop. What he didn't know was sometimes the owner liked to stay late. Luis heard a noise, ran out and left me to deal with a man with the biggest gun I'd ever seen, pointed right in my face. How did you get hooked up with that guy in the first place? He used to come to the center. He gave me attention. I didn't really have a lot of that as a foster kid. What happened to your parents? They died in a car crash. I was 10. Shit- Can we talk about something else? No disrespect, but,.. Au right. Yeah, let's take a break. I just need to get outside. Let's go eat. You all not coming? We're going to stay back. Don't do anything I wouldn't do! What exactly wouldn't you do? Him. You see, that's messed up. I didn't even say nothing, Why you got to come at me like that? You're asking for it all the time! God! I asked you to stay so we could talk. I mean, there's still a lot I don't know about you. What do you want to know? Well, for starters, a dance and business major? What's that about? My father is the one that's pressing me into finance. He just doesn't think that there's a future for me in dance. But the way I look at it is, if we win Battle Zone, I could go on tour for a year just doing what I love. And I can go back to school with no regrets. And it's like I gave it that shot. You know what I mean? I know. I know what it's like to have people not believe in you, Is that why you want to win so bad? It's not even about that, really. I mean, the people that really count, Mrs. Daniels. You. I mean, they've always had my back, even when I didn't see it. And whether we win or lose, I'm going to keep dancing. It's how I say the things I want to say. (SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING) One of these crews is going home tonight. You don't want to miss this. So, everyone, let's get this party started on Dance Battle Zone. (CHEERING) (HIP HOP MUSIC) (SINGSONG) Uh-huh! MARIO: That was intense! Give it up for HD Crew! (UPBEAT MUSIC) MAN: All the way, HD!

Peace. (CROWD CHANTING) Hey, Maria, wait up. I'll catch up with you later. Here. I can't take that. You got to give it back to Mr. Kapoor. Tell him what you did. I took it back to the store, and I paid for it. You did? Yeah. Once I got him to put the bats down, he let me make things right between us. But I want you to have it. Why? I'm trying to say thank you, so just take the damn bracelet. Au right. Thank you. Going in for a hug. Let's just get this over with. (MARIA LAUGHS) Hey, Can I come in? Sure. What's on your mind?

Worst-case scenario, I go back to trying to find a job. I don't know what me and Lyric are going to do. I mean, we're the only ones our grandma can really count on, Look, let's just stop talking negative, all right? We didn't go there to lose. We're not gonna lose. We're just not. Go! HD!
