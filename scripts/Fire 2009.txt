Read them now?) (From: the Falk. I can't take it anymore. Feel like blowing my head off. Does that make me a coward?) Ok. That's fine. Bye. (Calling Mom) (New message - Sis) (From: Sis I want to go home.) I want to go home. Come. Bathroom? (Turn off sound.) She probably has company. Doubt she will let me in tonight. What will you do? I'll be alright. Don't have time to sit here now. Don't you need them yourself? You don't have to leave. I've told you not to come here. I miss you. Can I come in? Are you seeing someone? No, I am not. Please leave. Mom and dad can't find you here. Can I borrow some money? It's important. Please. Hello. Do you have a light? Are you ok? Hi! Silver! Look! My God, she has puppies! -Did you know? -Yes, they are six weeks old now. That one is Sis. And that is the Falk. I don't know if they are girls or boys, but.... Hey! This is private property! We're sorry, we'll leave now. Bye, Silver. -Do you know the dog? -Yes, she used to be ours. Our father gave her away just before he died. He died? I thought he was only moving. He was full of cancer. Did he say where he was moving? I didn't know he even had a family. Just stay here and visit the dog if you like. Why did you say he died? What did you want to say? The truth. That he left, because he couldn't stand mom anymore. (From Ingrid You can sleep here. I miss you. Home alone until Wednesday.) -Little one. -Sweetheart. How are you? Dance for me. Remember to lock when you leave. (I love you, mommy.) (New Messages from Mom. Read now?) (From Mom. Love you, too, Falk) Flatmates I'm going to find me a sexy girl tonight. So get off then. Are you horny or what? What are you talking about? You're rubbing yourself against me. You're the one who wanted to lie here. Yeah, but you're the one rubbing. Okay Hampus, I'm damn horny. Especially on your tight little ass. You are. You really are. Let me touch it. Okay, be gentle. Fucking hell, that's disgusting! I'll have to screw you a little then. Fuck you. Yes, I fucked you.

No, I want to finish up today. We can go to a gay club ... and you could get laid. It's been a while. That's probably why you are so grumpy all the time. Yeah, that's probably why Hampus.

Do you have to go? -Aren't you going to pee? -Don't have to, after all. -What's that? -A razor. I am going to shave. Ok? I'll wait. When I get my hotdog stand I won't let anyone buy anything.

They actually made a mistake with the cake! It's a good thing that I stopped by and checked up on them. It would have been a disaster if Anders didn't get his favourite cake for his birthday. By the way, we need to know if they are coming. Who? -Nice to meet you. -Nice to see you again. This is Marie. You remember her? The artist. Oh.Yes.That's right. -Could I have a word? -Yes, of course. I'll walk you out. Just a minute, Mother. I got the job in Copenhagen! Congratulations! How wonderful for you! For the both of us!

Cheers! And who are you? I'm Marie.... Just a friend of Caroline's. Caroline. Caroline? It's time to bring out the cake. -Everything is ready in the kitchen. -Yes, of course... I can't understand how you can stand this charade. It will be a relief to go to Copenhagen. Stop it. -Everything is so easy for you. -What do you mean? We can't just leave, just like that. Of course we can. We have talked about so many times. This is what we want. Let's not talk about it now. I have already accepted the job in Copenhagen. Kiss me.
