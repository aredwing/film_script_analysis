Where is there no CCTV camera? Your make-up room Careful, sir Gaurav makes Aryan You're very stubborn. You don't listen to me Why are you hiding? Talk face-to-face I stand face-to-face, Aryan Khanna But you never see me Now when I'm not there, you're longing to see me I know the feeling I felt it among the crowd in front of your house Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting. The audience interaction... Yeah. I'm coming - I'll take care of it - Thank you I'll come back and see you. Hi sweetheart Hope you enjoyed the show - Aryan, it was marvelous - Thank you That's my daughter She's been practicing a step to dance with you for two months Actually we were both practicing How pretty is she You know what? Let me start with the young one ...and I'll come back for the experience We've found Chandna In the corridor, across from where you're dancing I'm not dancing Chandna is on the dance floor What the hell is wrong with him? I was dancing. He started touching me here, there, everywhere I don't know. You'll have to do something - Get him out - I don't care What the hell are you doing? Mr. Bhutiani? - Where do you think you are? - Calm down, Mr. Bhutiani - What happened? - That girl is like my daughter Is this how you film stars behave? I'm really sorry, ladies. I'm sorry I'll explain. The guy who was here wasn't me - Nonsense - It was somebody else I'm Aryan Khanna - I'm Aryan Khanna - What nonsense! You known me for years I love you guys. I'd never harm you people That person wasn't me I suggest you leave Keep back! Stop the car! No one has given me the interaction script 15 minutes to show time. Is there a delay? What? The show's cancelled They've boycotted the show Sponsors have also pulled out Nobody came, not a soul Whats wrong with you? You wimp Watch where you're going? Media playing up the story The wedding video has gone viral Given Khanna's status, he must take responsibility for his actions Is he attention-seeking? Movie stars forget that one day they'll be has-beens Stars must go through traumas. Look at what his done It's a crime if an ordinary man misbehaves... ...if it's a star - it's a stunt. Why these double standards... ...for stars? A criminal is a criminal Hello Hello, sir. It's me, Aryan. I'm calling from London I know you are in London, but what's going on? A Delhi boy is impersonating me, committing crimes We have to arrest him But the crimes are committed outside of India We can't arrest him. It's not in our jurisdiction Must we wait till he commits a crime in India? His name is Gaurav Chandna Find me his Delhi address. It will help You don't teach me my job But who shall we arrest? You're the accused, Aryan I just... Come back to India Then we'll look into the matter with the proper procedure. OK? Hello What did he say? Organise a press conference first thing tomorrow - In Mumbai? - No, here in London You now have the video footage and all the documents, etc You have proof... ...that Aryan Khanna did not commit these crimes You're angry with me, and you have the right to be But believe me That dangerous and evil face you see on TV is not me That person is not me So please give me time Time, so that I can prove I've done nothing wrong I'd never do anything that would make you ashamed... ...to call me your star Whatever I am... I just want to say, I would never do anything like this Thank you Sir, do you know this impostor? Have you met him? Sorry. We can't talk now. The case is under trial What about the imposter's name? As soon as we have proof, you'll be the first to know Are you the real Aryan Khanna or the imposter? You find this funny? A big joke? If this happened to a girl in your family would you still be grinning? A woman was molested and you find it's funny? And one more thing This press meet is not to prove my innocence I want to warn you all The man who's impersonating me, spoiling my name He can hurt anyone, anytime So please be careful Thank you everybody. Thanks for coming Aryan has a flight to catch, he's going back to India So have a great day and see you soon MUMBAI Don't stop, go from behind Open up! One minute, sir. Madam said we must inform her Good. Hurry up Before the journalists outside mob me Hello Ma'am, can sir come in? No, wait a second - Are you sure it's him? - It sounds like sir Ask him to face the camera Sir, ma'am wants you to step forward Hi, I am Aryan Khanna. Height 5'10. Black hair, black eyes A big nose School: Kendriya Vidyalaya, New Delhi Hans Raj College, Delhi University Give me the phone, quick! The press will surround me Let me in.

It's way past their bedtime Of course Let them sleep Let's relax and talk quietly in our room Yes - What an entrance exam! - You passed with flying colours I spent my life preparing for this moment Relax. Make yourself a drink. I'll run the shower for you Of course She was crying. Not easy getting her to sleep again It's better for us both if Isha stays asleep I did say... ...we could talk calmly Why do you need that? Give I have nothing against you or your children Give me that Senior ignores me You can't let him do that Show me Aryan's study, he's always talking about it Sound asleep Come, come Sit. He lands in 20 minutes. I haven't much time Come on, sit down This room has so many stories Many stories behind these awards In these costumes Days that Aryan does not want to forget Memories he wants to keep close to his heart I treasured his memories too Kept them right here At home, on the walls of my room, in cupboards On shelves like these Aryan Khanna filled every corner of my life But he ended it all Five minutes! I asked him for only five minutes Know what he said? It's my life Why must I give you even five seconds of it? - I apologise on his behalf - Why should you apologise? I hit Sid Kapoor for his sake He was hassling Aryan What did Aryan do? Threw me in jail. Had me beaten Said: It's a crime! A crime? Crime is what I'll do now Breaking hearts of fans who are devoted to you... ...is a crime too You tell me Am I so wrong? When he fights with you, doesn't he say sorry? So, why can't he say sorry to me? Tell me! Don't do this. I beg you What do you mean please? He left nothing for me. Why must I leave anything for him? How can I? Impossible A sham. All lies Liar. He's a fake The rascal acts all the time An actor after all I wanted to give him my trophy A belated happy birthday, Aryan Khanna Open the door! I sent the children to my parents They were terrified. I didn't know what to tell them Isha asked me repeatedly: Why did Papa destroy the study? Don't worry. It's ok - Why don't we call the police? - The police will do nothing They'll ask for proof. They believe I'm the criminal I came this far in life on my own steam I'll handle it myself Play rough like a street hoodlum I'll rip him apart. Send him back to where he belongs Gaurav Chandna has seen my star face Now he'll see my real face I'm a Delhi man too The dangerous and evil face on the news is not me That person is not me. Give me time I'll prove I've done nothing wrong I'd never do anything to make you ashamed calling me your star Aryan Khanna's press conference proves that he is innocent A criminal is impersonating him and committing crimes Who is the culprit? His name? His whereabouts? No one knows the motives behind his terrible actions The police have informed us that they're very hopeful... ...this criminal will not escape them When he's arrested, he'll be severely punished Hello, Gauru Mummy What's wrong with your phone? Where are you, Gauru? Right here I'm ok And you? Son, come home soon. We're in trouble You've roamed the world, now return to your home Aryan? You barged into my home? You can barge into mine, can't I do the same? I came here to grab your parents by the throat To ask why they produced a nasty son like you - But I am not a lowlife like you - Don't drag my parents into this They did nothing What did my kids do? I went alone into your fortress. Did you bring an army? I am here alone, Gaurav Chandna No security, no secretary. No star, no hero If you have the guts, face me Settle the score The score will only be settled when you apologise Get on the stage at the Inder Vihar contest and say sorry And listen... If you touch my parents with a feather even... I know your mother-in-law's house, where your children are hiding Your daughter is very cute, by God - Your son is stubborn like you - You rascal I'll bury you in a gutter here, if you dream of harming my kids What will my parents think? Such a big star... ...with such a foul tongue Forget it See you at the contest Your son has lost his mind - He's crossed the line - Our Gaurav was not like that He was a good boy He changed after meeting you What would you have lost if you gave him 5 mins? Don't blame Aryan It's our fault We let him get obsessed by your glamorous life Not your hard slog. He would've followed your example Worked hard and become someone Then the call center girl could've become his girlfriend or wife He has a girlfriend? A one-way romance. Gaurav loves her but... Enough. We have to accept things the way they are - Where's the contest held? - The other end of the colony Apologise. End this terrible situation You think I'm wrong too? And I must apologise? Arrest him He must be punished Imprison him for years, if you must But don't beat him Please Hey Junior. Where were you? - Hello Uncle, Aunty - Hello Have you been watching the news on TV about Aryan? Never mind I have good news for you all I've got my American visa I knew it Why is he standing with his back to me? It's not like him He's going on stage soon, he's just nervous Him? And nervous? Has he done anything in life besides copying Aryan? Hey Superstar, your make-up... Neha I have to talk to you Super surprise! Western Union - moving money for better Now for the last act of the Super Star competition Our favourite winner Our Junior Aryan Khanna He's a criminal!

Get lost - He's nuts - Thinks he's real Aryan Khanna Get him off Wait! He is talking to me. I'll deal with it I love you! Drop it. You love only Aryan He can go to hell - Is that you talking? - It's not just talk I've sent him to hell I fixed Aryan Khanna for good First in London, then in Dubrovnik I made my way into his house too Smashed everything in sight If you don't believe me, read the papers. Watch TV or the Net Your Gaurav is famous the world over I'm no less than Aryan Not at all I am a star in real life Not a star. A monster What?

No, Gaurav It's not over Think of your parents Stop this madness Forget it. You won't understand Aryan Khanna has cleared his name completely But Inder Vihar's Gaurav Chandna... ...has tied his name to superstar Aryan's name forever A wave of love greets Aryan's on his birthday today Fans are singing his songs.
