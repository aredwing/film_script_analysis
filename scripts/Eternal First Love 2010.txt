Thank you. - It taste good, Bye. - Thanks. "Ruri Sato" I have to give an answer to Mr. Mizusawa today. I thought I'd get your opinion first. That's all. I'll talk to you later. "1 missed call" Make my own decisions, huh? Sorry to make you wait. Take... Takeshi... Why do you come here? Ruri... Yeah? Watch out! ETERNAL FIRST LOVE  - Um... - Yuuki... I'll get the doctor. Do you realize what you did?! A person is dead because of you! You know! Do you know! Who... are you? What a surprise seeing you come out of your room. Who are you? - Satoshi. - Satoshi... Do you know me? Yuuki Makihara. Yuuki Makihara... Is Yuuki your brother? - Uncle. - Uncle... So it's true. You lost your memory. You have retrograde amnesia caused by head trauma. You have no memory of events before the injury. I've been interested in neuroscience. What are you doing? Cleaning the kitchen. The kitchen should be kept clean. Or else, it'll feel bad. Uncle! Uncle! How long are you gonna do that? The kitchen should be kept clean. Or else, it'll feel bad. Mr. Mizusawa says that too. You really are his apprentice. Thank God you're awake. I thought you died. You better lie down. Thanks. It's the first time you thanked me. First time? I'll thank you properly. You hungry? Oh well. Buon appetito. Only on special days. Wow. Let's eat. What do you call this? Angel's rice omelet. Angel? You should make a happy face especially when you're sad. Then an angel will give you a gentle push from behind. Someone cooked for me in Naples too. Good. I'm happy. What was that? Do you remember something? The sense of taste and smell can stir up memories. Who was she? What are you doing? Did you make that? Then... You're kidding. Are you my sister? You really don't remember? You're much older than me. Half brother and sister. Dad was 25 when I was born and 40 when you were born. You come out of your room for the first time in 3 years, cause a fatal accident and conveniently lose your memory. Why am I the sister of a man like you? How long do I have to wait? His ashes are entombed already. You've done enough and you're not even his family. Sorry. I'm sorry about Takeshi and I realize how hard it must be for you. That's why... I wanted to wait until you came to terms with it. But can't you consider my feelings too? I really don't want to ask this but... What does Take mean to you? More than a childhood friend, right? Is he the one you... I think... friends. Friends? Maybe you won't believe me but there's no other word for us. Not family nor siblings nor lovers. I'm sorry I can't explain well. But... he's important to me. More than me? Maybe that's how you feel but how did Take feel? He... That day... I think he came running... to tell you something important. A special feeling of his. At least to me that's how it looked. I do feel bad about this. But... with the way I feel now, I can't get married... All right. I'll wait. I'll wait until you're ready. I'm sorry. We heard you come every week. We're so very sorry. That's enough. You can stop apologizing. Obviously we're ready to pay reparations... As I told your father, I don't want any money. I'm not his family. Our father came? He gave me a blank check. I hope he wasn't rude... Will you please go now? Please... Leave me alone. I don't want money. Miss Sato... I heard you were here. I have nothing to say to you. You were... My girlfriend... Isn't that right? I'm sorry to surprise you. But at least I was in love with you. Or that's how I felt for a long time. What do you want? Is it not true? That's what my memory tells me. Miss Sato! "Takeshi Tanaka" It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me! So... Mom told me... what happened. I don't know who I am. Well, you do have amnesia. But... maybe no one knows who he really is. We can't see ourselves... without being reflected off something. You're philosophical. So we need someone to look at us. Uncle... I have a favor to ask. What? Will you teach me how to cook? When people eat good food, they smile and look happy. Yeah. I haven't seen Mom smile recently. And if people kept eating good food and smiling there wouldn't be any conflict. To tell you the truth, that's what I want to do. So? Okay. I have a favor too, then. Will you stop calling me "uncle"? Shall I call you "Yuuki" or what? You see, it doesn't feel right. Then what? Napoli. Napoli? I think that was my nickname when I was a kid. - Okay. Napoli, it is. - Thanks. By the way, I have a name too. Satoshi. Satoshi. First, the basics. Cutting an onion. Go like this. - The fettuccine's getting too soft! - Yes. No! Watch this. Not like that. Quicker. How many times I have taught you. - The order for Table 12. - Yes - Take, - Yes work harder or you'll never handle a frying pan. Yes, sir. Onions really make you cry, huh? Funny, isn't it? I wonder why. "Nanki Shirahama Airport" Cooking starts with the ingredients. They grow organic vegetables here. I hear about them a lot these days. Vegetables that... are grown in soil made of compost without use of chemicals for 2 years or more. It's huge. A good sweet potato feels heavy. It looks good. What do I do with these? The best place... to eat something is where it was caught or grown. Right when they're fresh. Napoli! This is a bad idea. You're ditching the funeral. Shouldn't you, Ruri...? Say goodbye to your dad? It's not a goodbye. Napoli You're doing fine... without your parents. I will be too without my dad... Hurry up! Good food! Look at this lobster. It looks great. Okay, to finish it off... Zuppa di mare... Seafood soup. Here I go. How is it? Not bad. What does that mean? There's more. Want some? We have rice flour bread. It's really good. - Here you go. - Thanks. This bread is yummy! What do you want to eat for your last meal in life? Let me think... How about you? - Spaghetti Neapolitan. - Like I said... No Spaghetti Neapolitan in Naples. It's true. I used to live there. But I wanna eat it. Then I'll make it for you. Really? When? Let's see... The best day of your life. I'll make the perfect Spaghetti Neapolitan. It's a promise, okay? You cleaned your room? They say brain damage and memory loss can turn a person into someone else. I see it's true. It's not quite like that. I really might be someone else. The other day, you said you didn't know who you were. Yuuki Makihara was a pianist, right? Napoli? Napoli? Why not me? "Vienna Philharmonic invites..." "Yuichiro Makihara as soloist" Excuse me. Mr. Asakura is here. Come on. How was Yuuki? Depressed. That's too bad. But it's because he's not good enough. He's still young though. At 25, he still hasn't been onstage overseas. He's out of the question. I didn't want it... to end with me. That's why at age 40, I produced him in a different womb. I taught him everything I know. Jinko and now Yuuki... They both let me down. Talent is not hereditary. Napoli... You okay? Napoli? He dumped me. I'm not your love counselor. Gimme some good food to drown my sorrow in. That, I can do for you. Why don't men realize what a great gal I am? You choose the wrong guys. I should settle for you. I'm kidding. Now, food. But eat in moderation. I finally got accepted. It's about time. Why do you go to Italy every year? To study cooking, of course. In only 2 days each visit? Just breathing the air in Italy does me good. You have no money saved up. I have enough to get by and that's fine with me. Do you go there to see someone? A super long-distance relationship? What goes on inside that head of yours? You always get those airmails. They're love letters, aren't they? I can't read Italian but I'm right, aren't I? Why don't you become a novelist? You never have a girlfriend. None of your business. I don't plan on being single forever though. Are we always gonna be like this? Yeah. I like us like this. So if... I get married to someone... Yeah? Will you cook... for me then too? In that case... A date with Mr. Mizusawa? I interviewed him for an article. You went to Le Logge? Yeah. We hit it off. I'm not surprised. If it makes you uncomfortable, I can say no. Make your own decisions. He's a great chef. He looks like a bully but has a warm heart. I respect him. But he kicked you out. I left on my own will. Really? He'll treat you to good food for sure. Then I should definitely go. Yeah, you should. Fork. "1 missed call" Watch out! Which are you now? Napoli. Do you want me to call you Takeshi? Thanks. But Napoli is fine. Okay. There's no body I can return to. But I have to live. As Yuuki Makihara. As Takeshi Tanaka. Late-stage cancer? Yes. He shouldn't even be able to stand. There's no medical explanation why he's up and about. How about radiation or chemo? I'm afraid it's too late. It's a miracle he's still alive. What should I do? Let him do what he wants. "Closed indefinitely" I remember. A cold and a fever. I'm gonna die. Ruri... Why aren't you at home resting? Reason. I have no food at home - so I can't take medicine. - Yes. Plus, I don't want anybody to see me like this. But I can? I want bagna cauda. Don't be stupid. That's how they cure colds in Italy. The Japanese eat rice porridge. Then a porcini risotto. If you don't have porcini, I'll settle for Milan-style. Brown rice porridge with pickled plum. Eat. Thanks. How do you make it like this? Japanese rice has great flavor. Why don't you put it on the menu? Japanese-style risotto. No one will order it. I think they will. Go home and sleep when you finish. I'll stay here in the back. Here? Why? I told you I have no food at home. Have Mr. Mizusawa make something for you. I told you I don't want anyone to see me like this. Especially Mr. Mizusawa. Understand? You're dating him, aren't you? Yeah. I think he likes me. I haven't told him about you. I didn't ask you to. Why did you quit Le Logge? Mr. Mizusawa thought highly of you, right? I wanted to cook and watch people eat at the same time. When people eat good food, they look so happy. It makes me glad I was born. I'm happy you found a boyfriend. What are you doing? Brown! You know it's me. Good boy. What are you doing here? How did you get in? Ruri... Don't call me by my first name. What do you want? I'm... Get out or I'll call the police. Will you rent this place to me? I'd like to use it. I'm quite good at cooking. I have... to fulfill Takeshi's life. You might not believe me but I'm Takeshi Tanaka. Eat this... and you'll see it's my... Takeshi's cooking. I also knew where to find the spare key. I'm in a different body but I have Takeshi's memories. So... Takeshi is... dead. Please leave. You took in Brown. Thank you. Wait! How did you know Brown's name? He's Takeshi's dog. The rice omelet... The first dish Takeshi made for Ruri. The angel's rice omelet. Who are you...? Beware of fire... and lock up before you leave. So you'll... For... 2 months only. That's fine. Thank you. And... Will you let Brown stay with me? You can come anytime too, Miss Ruri. Hello. - The restaurant's open again. - Yes. With a new chef? I'm taking over... for a while. Sorry... We like the old chef's food. Hold on. Try it. It's on the house. It's 100% like the old chef's. It's good. You're right. It is. It's good. Here you are. Enjoy. I never knew you liked to cook. Sis... Sis? What a surprise. Why? You've never called me that. Really? You were cold especially toward me. We both have Dad's blood in our veins. To Dad, you and I are faulty goods. I wish... we could have done the things we liked instead of piano. How's this restaurant for next month's feature? They have a new chef, plus he's good-looking and the food even got better. But he won't accept interviews. Pay him a surprise visit and write me an article. You can do it, right? Yes. Use work to blow away the marriage blues. I speak from experience. Sorry. Not open yet... I'm Sato from Monthly Mangiare. I apologize for barging in. I'd like to write an article on your restaurant. Lastly, what made you want to become a chef? When I was small, my family moved to Naples, Italy, for my father's work. He was just so cool. And he doted on me. I wanted to become... a cool grownup like him. When I was 12, my parents died in a sea accident which I survived by a miracle. For a while, the chef... took me in like I was his real son I am Takeshi, and nice to meet you. but I ended up with relatives in Japan I am Ruri. Nice to meet you too. and enrolled in a local middle school. That's where... I got the nickname "Napoli." Once, I cooked something... for a classmate of mine. That's when I first felt it. The exhilaration of cooking... I am going to take this. for other people. Especially to someone who really enjoys the food. I was saved by her smile. To see that smile, - Is that good? - Not bad. I thought I'd cook anytime she asks. She loved to eat and all she thought about was... making me cook for her. This plate is good. I can't count... how many dishes I made for her. Here you go. - Thank you. - Yes. She was a genius at looking happy when eating my food. - I am going to take this. - Sure! Having said that, she never once told me how good it tasted. I think I got better at cooking... to make her say, "It's good." She was silently giving me the motivation. We're through. This is nice. Much nicer than I thought. I was worried 'cuz you said food stall. What's on the menu? Anything you want to eat. Is that the restaurant's slogan? It depends on the ingredients. Okay, listen. Appetizer, Caprese salad. First course, gnocchi Sorrentina. Second course, sea bass acqua pazza. Dessert, baba and double espresso. - A Taurasi wine. - Okay. What's the name? I haven't decided yet. Then I'll give it one. Ristorante D'Angelo. "The angel's restaurant"? Yes. Make it one that gives people a gentle push from behind. Sounds good. The first meal she ordered. A crazy course. You should make a happy face especially when you're sad. Then an angel will give you a gentle push from behind. Takeshi...? Are you enjoying playing with my feelings? This is not at all like Takeshi's cooking. I'm never coming here again. I don't ever want to see you either. Napoli... Takeshi! Takeshi! - Wait! - What do you want? I ran like this that night. I wanted to tell you... Tell me what? Hey! What happened? What's the matter? No! What are you doing?! Wake up! What's wrong?! Wake up! Sorry. Who are you? What do you want from me? I... I hate you. I hate Yuuki Makihara for taking Takeshi from me. Give him back! I want Takeshi back! Even if you don't believe I'm Takeshi I want to love you afresh as Yuuki Makihara. I love you. You're... not Takeshi. The real Takeshi would never say that. You couldn't begin to understand but Takeshi and I were friends. We were friends. A few times, I thought of becoming... more than just friends. But Takeshi... With a smile like an angel, he so gently rejected the idea and chose to stay friends with me. Do you know how much I was saved by that? Every relationship... doesn't have to develop... into a romance. A special friendship that embraces you can make life so wonderful. You'd never understand that. - I... - Stop. I want to forget. Takeshi went to heaven. I'm getting married. To a man who loves me more than anyone in the world. I made up my mind. My life has to go on without Takeshi. So... Disappear from my life forever. What happened? We're closed today. All right. No questions. But I'm relieved. You didn't cry when Take died. I was worried. But I'm glad. Finally, you're crying. It's okay to cry when you feel sad. Take's accident got me thinking. I thought about many things. I thought... You and Take are alike. You never show your weakness and are stronger than anybody. You both try too hard at everything. But nobody is always strong. We all feel like crying at times. You don't have to act tough when you're with me. That's the kind of man I want to be for you. I really do. Is that a bad thing? Mr. Mizusawa... Will you marry me? The one who's been saying that all along is me. There's something you should know. What? Oh no... Napoli? Napoli! You should at least eat. Napoli... I'm still alive. Sorry... I shouldn't have provoked you like that. It's okay. I feel relieved. Relieved? It wasn't Takeshi who held her and told her he loved her. - What do you mean? - It was Yuuki. So my uncle overrode Napoli? This is confusing. I want her to be happy. I can't do that with this body. What do you mean? I know... It's my own body. I guess it's not just mine. How can you laugh? I laugh especially when I'm sad. - I need a favor. - What is it? When I finished the song I felt connected to the universe so I went up on the roof. I thought I could reach out and feel the universe's life force. But I had an attack. I passed out and fell off. There's something I want to do while I still have Yuuki's memories. Good music can make people smile. Just like good food. Brown, chow time. - Excuse me. - Yes. Is there a Takeshi Tanaka here? Takeshi Tanaka? Yes. A letter for Takeshi Tanaka. There's no return address on it. Do you know who it's from? Who? Don't worry about it. Hello. May I? Please. Thanks. It was great. You're investigating, as usual. As usual? Whether it's popular or not you go to each new restaurant to check out its food. You're the most diligent chef I know. May I ask for a favor? Thank you for coming... to our wedding reception. We've only invited... our closest friends today. Although we don't have anything special planned the meal you'll be eating today is made by an up-and-coming chef I discovered myself. It's not a course and the entire menu was left up to the chef. I believe he's more skilled than the one at Le Logge. I hope you enjoy it. Up-and-coming chef? Sorry I didn't tell you. Be strong. It's Takeshi Tanaka's biggest moment of his life. Who's the chef? Eat and you'll know. Let's eat. Ruri... What are you making? Authentic Spaghetti Neapolitan? Never. Why not? It's the one thing I won't make. I still remember to this day. It was the beginning of everything. Perfect. Who made this? I promised not to tell. Yuuki Makihara... I decided a long time ago to ask a chef like Take to cook for my wedding. Let's finish the meal. Please let Takeshi and me be together forever. It's ready! Seafood soup has to be eaten right away! How can it end up shaped like this? I had a bad feeling when you said you were making chocolate. Sorry. No. This chocolate you made as an example... How do you make it so nice? I quit. I'm never making chocolate again. I like this one better. It's full of love. You ate it! The chocolate I worked so hard to make for my true love. Sorry about that. Give him this. I can't give my true love something a guy friend made. Who is he? I won't say. Why? Did you want one from me? Out of obligation? No thanks. "To Takeshi, from Ruri" Darn. It looks nicer than mine. How innovative. Japanese-style risotto and bagna cauda. The taste of the earth... I've been here 3 days and he hasn't touched me. He took it seriously when I said no fooling around. I caught a cold on purpose so I could stay here. I'll do what I have to. I'll keep my cold until he pins me down. What are you doing!? Who are you talking to? Were you listening? Of course not. - Why are you dressed like that out here? - Yes. - You have a cold. - I have a cold. Come inside. - No. - No? Don't be stupid. Make me rice porridge? No. Not if you go outside dressed like that. You can eat every grain so it's easy to wash the bowl. Great diet food since it makes you full with a small amount of rice. Eat in moderation. Napoli... - I'm okay. - Don't overwork yourself. Today, you have to let me. The final dish is something special for the bride from the chef. For the bride only? That's not fair. Spaghetti Neapolitan does not exist in Naples where it gets its name. Originally a dish eaten by the American soldiers in Japan it's become one of Japan's most common "taste of home." For years, the chef pursued the perfect recipe for this day. Please enjoy. Go on. It's Takeshi's cooking. Are we always gonna be like this? Yeah. I like us like this. So if... I get married to someone... Yeah? Will you cook... for me then too? In that case... Let me cook for your wedding reception. I'll make you a special Spaghetti Neapolitan. It's a promise, okay? Ruri... Sorry... One last thing. I have to tell him something. Takeshi... Takeshi! It was good. It was really good. I'm sorry I never told you. That day... The day of the accident I wanted to say something to you before anybody else. But I never got to because of what happened. Congratulations. From the bottom of my heart. Takeshi... Napoli... Are you okay? Where am I? Miss Ruri's wedding. Miss Ruri? Do I know you? - Napoli... - Napoli? Satoshi, what are you doing dressed like that? And why am I dressed like this too? Uncle Yuuki... Are you Yuuki Makihara again? What do you mean? I've always been Yuuki Makihara. I don't know who you are but congratulations anyway. I wish you happiness. Thank you. Let's go. Takeshi! He's not him. Your acting was so corny. I wonder if she believed it. Don't worry. She's uncomplicated. No matter how sad she is, she can't help but smile over good food. I was about to crack up. - "Where am I ?" - Shut up. - You okay? - Now I am. Thanks for waiting for me. I've become a patient man. Kiss her... This is like the sky in Naples. True blue. Take me with you the next time. But there won't be a next time... Napoli... Napoli... Napoli... Dear Satoshi Makihara How are you doing? It's been 3 years... since we moved to Naples. I wanted to tell you... about the airmail with no return address. I found the sender. Who are you? A friend of Takeshi Tanaka. How is Takeshi? He met with an accident... Is he dead? Oh my God... Ever since I fell ill he's been sending me money saying he's just trying to be a good son. I told him no so many times. When he came to Naples each year for the anniversary of his parents' death he cooked for me. I think he wanted to show you his gratitude. You taught him the joys of life. What's this? My husband made it. He studied Takeshi's recipe. Takeshi followed your words until the day he died. "You should make a happy face especially when you're sad." "Then an angel will give you a gentle push from behind." Yes... Takeshi was an angel.
