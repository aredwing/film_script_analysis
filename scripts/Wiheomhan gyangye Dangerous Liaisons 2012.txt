To my dear Fenyu, from Huimin, in the 15th year of Minkuo. Huimin - your husband? I'd \ove to know what sort of man he was'? He was a respected teacher - modest and patient. He knew me better than anyone. If you gave me a chance, I could understand you even more. Don't say that. Fenyu, you mustn't live in the past and let your beauty wither. You don't need to tell me how to live. What are you doing? I want you... to say goodbye lo him. I'm helping you be resolute. Fenyu. Fenyu. You won't read it - I'll read it to you. My darling, my Fenyu... On September 7 this year I was reborn because that's when I first saw you. You're the first to show me how love and anguish go hand in hand. But it's your fate to know me.

My dear Fenyu. A day apart from you feels like a year. Though you tear up my notes, I'll keep writing. What's happening lo me'? I'm unhappy and anxious here. I used to find it so oppressive there. But now I dream of its tranquility. That's because you're there. Thank you for alerting me. Otherwise - It's what a godmother does. Miss M0, you know? Mr Jin is nearly back from overseas. Help me think of how... to keep Beibei away from that scound rel. Why not visit Madame Du in the country? Separate them. Puppy love - comes fast. goes just as fast. In a month or two, she'll have forgotten him. That won'! do. Xie Yifan is there. That's even riskier. Don'! worry. Xie Yifan is in the oily. Really'? That's good. I could speak lo his grandmother. You know, I called Fem/u the other day and warned her to beware of Xie Yifan. For a good woman to fall into his clutches it'd be like being bitten by a dirty blowfly. A blowfly? It's time I made my move. This blowfly will bite that cow's little darling. We're both onto the same prey now. And the other one? I can'! work her out at all. Is that so'? Are you in love with her? Love? My whole life, I've only ever loved you. Careful. If you \ove, you \ose. Of course. She should be losing her heart by now. Young Dai. This is China's future Cezanne.

Miss Du, you wish to forego your late husbands estate? Very well. I advance, she retreats. I slop, she comes closer. This proper lady is really something. I almost told her I loved her. Oh, is that so? She's extremely sensitive. If it weren't for Fenyu. I might never have met such a woman. You're in love with her. No I'm not. You are. She's touched your heart. Impossible. I was only playing the lover to conquer her. If what you're feehng isn't love, there is no such thing as love. All I've done has been for you. She was just our wager.

I just pushed you a wee bit and you gave up the woman you love. What a pity. Xie Yifan - you lose. I want my prize. I want it now. I said the loser has no right to the prize. If you turn me down, I will destroy you. What did you say'? I'll destroy you. As you wish. Wenzhou, I saw Beibei today. I heard some shocking news. She was deflowered by Xxe Yifan. She's lost the will to live. If you still want her, go to Jin Zhihuan. Tell him everything. You say you love Beibei, yes? More than life itself. Then let's do business. Restore the nation. Return it to honor. We'd rather die. Cherish China! Make China strong! Boycott Japanese goods! Buy Chinese products! Return it to honour. Restore the nation. We'd rather die. Cherish China!
