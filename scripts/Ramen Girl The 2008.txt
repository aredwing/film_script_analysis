Can you show me? Show me. Please tell me what you mean. What, are you crazy? I'm so freaking wasted I'm about to collapse. You got any beer? Sure. Thanks. Drama, total drama. You would not believe the stuff. The creep who pays the rent for my apartment keeps bringing home his ex and keeps bringing his friends Asking me to do favors and stuff. Once in a while, okay, I mean.. but there's a limit. Tonight, I get back from the bar, there he is with Godzilla and ask me to do him another favor I lost it. If you think I'm terrible, you should see the apartment. So do you think I could crash here? You? Hi. Hi, Abby. Hi. What a coincidence. Gretchen didn't tell me you are living here. Gretchen is full of surprises tonight. She's right in here. - Please, come in. - Thanks. Where should I put the suitcases? Anywhere you want, doesn't matter. Gretchen. I really need to sleep, honey. Toshi's here. Great. She's sleeping. Yeah. She looked really tired. What happened? She asked me if I have a car. And? Se oa muy molesta. She sound really upset. Tell me about it. Well Probably I should go. Sorry to bother you. No. Wait. Do you want something to drink before you go? I mean you come all this way. Personally, I could really use a beer. Yeah, me too. Okay. That's the ramen shop where I work. Easy commute. Yes. Your boss, he speaks English? Not a word. Really? I can't understand a word he tells me not to mention he's psychotic. He keeps trying to kill me. Why do you stay? Maybe that's because I have no where else to go? That's just pathetic. No. I think you're on a path to something. One day I'm sure I will taste Abby's ramen. God, I hope so. Yes. So, what about you? What's your path? My path. Typical Japanese. Work in a big company get married have children grandchildren then die. That's just grim. But in college I learn music. I had a band. That's cool. Most of the time we just got really drunk. And we are talking about how we are going to make revolution to the Japanese music ground. Then of course, we became salarymen. It's what our parents wanted. My parents would only be happy if I became a partner at a major law firm. Strange. Who'd to think we have the same problem? That's right. Interesting. Somewhere along the way I just forgot what I wanted to do with my life. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning I can't breath. That's probably why I started this habit. Sorry, I smoke just the last one and I don't have any. Wanna take a walk? It's monsoon. I guess I should go home now. Almost the morning. Have you ever been to the ramen museum in Yokohama? There's a ramen museum in Yokohama? You kidding me. I'm not kidding you. Really? - Yeah, really. - Okay, I have to see it. Let's go there next weekend. Yeah, okay. - Great. -I'll let Gretchen know. I don't think she's intsrested. Yeah, but it woud be awkward. She's my friend. I have to let her know. You guys going out and all. The first night you took a taxi home together. No, no. She just share thhe cab with me. So it's okay I call you? Yeah. It's okay, you call me. I don't understand you. Merry Christmas! Yankee, go home now. I'm sorry, I thought the decoration would look nice. I bought them at the market. Look. Look at the color The texture. I think corn can be beautiful. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hey Japan, I was fired tonight. On Christmas Eve. Heartless Japanese. Cold blooded Japan. I'll tell you one thing Nobody is running this side of town. The longer I'm here I don't understand anything or anybody. Like, my boss. I used to think it was the language. And now I just realise I don't get him at all. It's a bowl of soup. Tell him to get over it. No, no. There's something about the Japanese they make the perfect bowl of soup. It's kind of beautiful. It's like, with each bowl you try to get closer to perfection. I think that's beautiful. - Ain't that beautiful? - It's insane. Listen to me. The only you're going to survive in this country is to do what everybody else does Drink. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'm so full. When I was a kid I came here one time with my school. The other kids always made fun of me because my grandparents came fom Korea. I wanted to run away from those kids and sleep onto that ship. I want to go away from Japan, somewhere. Where? I don't know. I just want to go away from Japan. You are cold. I should take you home. No, I don't wanna go home. I'd rather be here with you. i don't understand you and sto hitting me. i don't understand, i don't understand Who is that guy n the photos? You know, the one you cry over. He's handsome. Paris. Don't hit me. Where you going, tough guy? Tough guy? WHat? You dished it out but you can't take it? Yes, I gotcha! What? What's wrong? I don't understand. You look so serious. My boss wants me to go to Shanghai. Oh, no. I've heard this before. How long? Three years. Three years? How long have you known about this? Since a couple of days. I have to go. It's my obligation. My God. You did it again. I don't want to leave you. Then tell them to send somebody else. That's realted to our work in Japan. If the company wants you to go, you have to go. Then how can you spend three more years in a job that you can't stand? How? Why why don't you just tell them to go to hell and do something algo que realmente te guste, algo para ti mismo? something that you really love, something for yourself? And don't say it's because you're Japanese because that's just not an excuse. I am Japanese. Why do Americans think that everybody should be like them? I've said everything that I have to say really. - Abby. - What? Would you please come with me? Where? Shanghai? Yes. We could be together. Please, don't do this to me. Please, Abby. Please come with me. Please, will you taste my broth? Please, Sensei. What are you doing? I did everything I saw you do. Everything. I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. Are you sure you won't come with me to the airport? No, no. That'd be too sad. Can you just tell me again just one more time you really, really want me to go with you? Go. I could miss your flight. Sensei, quick. Sensei, please help me. I keep trying and I never get it. Please. Teach me how to have But how? I don't know anything about love. Everytime I feel it it's gone it disappears. And all I have left is pain and sadness. Ijust needed to create something for myself. Myself. Myself. Successor. You .. My successor. I'd be honored. Where's sensei ? I can't leave without saying goodbye to sensei. and 1 Maezumi special. In a minute. Abby, there's a guy, he says he knows you. Who is he? From where? I don't know. I hated my job, so I did what you would do. I quit. I started to write music again. Welcome to my Ramen Shop. English Translation : i1chocolat @Subscene.com
