He's a little punk with a gun. And I want him to know that you wanted me. You liar. You tell him that, I'll kill you. Shouldn't get so violent. You're way too little for it. Get outta my house. Hello! Hello! Hi! Excuse me! Excuse me! Hi! Can you help me? I can't get out. Can you... I guess my handle broke. I know. Eddie... Quinn. Oh, yeah. We know him. - Always violent. - Yeah, well, he...

Anyone. - It was good. - What's good? - Perfect. Perfect. Does he make a habit, hitting you? - What? - Your face. Uh, this? Oh, no. Eddie didn't do this. No. Eddie wouldn't... He'd never touch me. - He'd never touch you? - No! No, and, you know, I don't want to talk about this anyway. 'Cause, you know, I'm not here about my face. And I don't want to get mad at anybody. I just, uh... When I go home, he's gonna want to kill... somebody that did this to me. He doesn't think he... He thinks somebody else does it? No. He doesn't do it. He doesn't... That's what I'm sayin'. Are you listening to me? - I'm tryin'. - OK. I know Eddie. OK? And I'm gonna go home, and he's gonna want to know who did it. And, you know, he's gonna think... I got raped, uh, or, you know, beat up, whatever, somethin' like that, and then he's gonna think somethin' else, and then he's gonna want to kill somebody. So, if you wanna... If you wanna sign these forms, we'll pick him up right now. - No, I don't wanna take him away. - OK. OK? I just wanted to be able to call somebody. In case something happened, and then maybe I couldn't handle it. - But forget it. That's OK. - All right. Here's my number. Somethin' comes up, you call me, OK? - Yeah, yeah. OK. - Go right to the phone, just call me up. You got a instinct, follow it, all right? - We'll send a wagon. We'll pick him up. - Hey. I love the guy. OK? I'm playing a dollar a ticket to listen to Augie stutter. I don't stutter! We were walkin' down the street... We were walkin' down the street the other day... Yeah, he says, "D-D-D-D-D-D-D." Hey! Where ya been? You were supposed to be at the doctor's at 3:00. I been callin' all day. The phone's just been ringin' and ringin'. I w... I went to the doctor's. - You did? - Yeah, but I couldn't find the place. - You couldn't? - No. I lost the address. You know, I only had three dollars, and then the car broke down. - So you get some change and call. - What? Well, if you're gonna disappear, let somebody know you're all right. Call where? There's a pay phone. Well, you call here, leave a message. It's pouring. What the hell has that got to do with it? Wh... What the hell has that got to do with anything? Well, I said it's rainin'. What are you doin' all the way down here? Come on next to me. You know everybody. - Sure. - What? I said I know everybody. Lucinda, get her a drink. What are you havin', Murph? Don't call me that, Eddie. I got a name. Well, come on down here. Let me take a look at ya. That's the way Uh-huh, uh-huh I like it Uh-huh, uh-huh That's the way Uh-huh, uh-huh Jesus fuckin' Christ. What the fuck happened to your eye? - God sakes. - L-I fell. You fell? - Where did you fall? - Right outside the place there. It was raining hard, and I was running just to keep from getting wet, and I slipped and fell, woke up there in the rain. I don't know how long I was out. I went home, you weren't there, so I came here. Here. Nice and warm. You're shakin' like a leaf. Get her a towel, will ya? Yeah, sure. You're frozen! Lucinda, get her another shot. - Let me see your head. - I'm fine. How could you be fine? Do you know what your face looks like? - Yeah. - Come on. Get her into the bathroom. Get her out of these wet clothes. Wrap a towel around her waist. Get her in a coat. I'm gettin' you to a doctor. - No doctors! - No doctors. Georgie, Lucinda, get her in the back before her brain freezes altogether, will ya? Shorty, do me a favour. Get me a drink, will ya? Pour me a drink. Three dollars. She's got three dollars in her pocket. She goes to the doctor with a bum carburettor. She's pregnant, and falls over. It's all I ever get, Chinese stories. Fables to cover foibles. - Disgusting. - Yeah. - I know. - Make good money, though. - Yeah. I have a pair of boots like that... - Here's one. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Do you have the time? - I have no idea. Must be about 7:30. - You have no idea, but it's 7:30? - Yeah, I think so. Oh, boy. Come on. Doctor. Doctor. Will you do me a favour? See this lady? She could be bleedin' internally. We have been waitin' an hour. The only reason I'm here is 'cause I'm pregnant, but you say the baby is fine, and I just want to go home. No. No, I didn't say that. What I said was I couldn't tell. So lay back on the bed. I'm gonna check that abdomen again, OK? - That's a doctor? - He looks like a doctor. Looks like a gladiator. - Pain? - No. - Pain? - Hey, the X-rays are negative. Pain? That tickles, right there. OK, that's it. Your X-rays are negative. There's nothin' wrong with ya. I'm takin' you out. Just wait here! We'll be out in a minute! I ain't gonna wait here all fuckin' night. Give the girl a break. She's had a rough night. Anyway, the baby's OK? - The baby's OK. - Yeah. I wouldn't want to be a woman. Neither would I. Some big Pollak sticking their fingers inside all your private parts. - I hate hospitals. - Mm-hmm. - Why don't you put the radio on? - Why don't you shut up! Put on somethin' nice. You look like hell. Gee, thanks, Eddie. You look fine. Just put yourself together. It's rainin'. Put on some heels, and that red dress. This is a crazy night to go dancin', with the face and the dress and the... Let's go eat. Whatever you kids want. Make up your minds. - Yeah. - What's everybody talkin' about? - We're here. - Yeah, we're here. - Know what I mean? - I don't know. Eddie, I'm hungry. You know what dancin' does? Dancin' sets up memories for when we get older. It keeps you in shape. Dancin' makes your eyes alive instead of dead. You should try it, Shorty. - You know I don't dance. - He don't dance. I'm serious. Just try it. We'll make it a thing. It'll be fun, Georgie. Yeah, I want to. I want to. - See that? - No. Not a chance. Oh, come on, Shorty. We never go out dancin'. Come on. We're here. Let's do something. - Shut up. - Come on. Look. He's leavin'. What do I gotta be, a 24-hour inspiration machine? Come on, move it! Last chance! No? OK. Bye, Georgie. Thanks for the ride. Gimme two. - It's a lousy night. - Yeah. Too much rain. Hey, wait. Hey, hey. You didn't pay for the tickets. Oh, geez. I forgot the money. Oh, and look at this. She's in her red dress and everything. You got any? She doesn't have any. I mean, no purse, nothin'. Could I write you an I.O.U.? I didn't bring the car, so I don't have my driver's license. But I got a big heart, and we gotta dance. How could you take a lady out with no money? I'm stupid. Look how sore she is. - She's embarrassed. - Could I sign for just a little cash? How much? We got a cab ride, oh, say two drinks. Make it three. Make it for 20, plus the tickets. Is that OK? Oh, you know, you're really... You're terrific. You really are terrific. Could we make it three more bucks? - Don't push it. - No, for you. - You don't have to do that. - I know. - I want to. - In that case, make it out to me, - otherwise I won't get the money. - What's your name? - Carmen Rodriguez. - Carmen Rodriguez? You could sing that. Eddie Quinn. Carmen Rodriguez. There you go. But I'm telling you, it's a lousy night. There's only about a handful of dancers up there. Thanks. What? I hate it when you do that. People like to be nice. You got a guilty conscience. - Come on. - I wanna go home. - Oh, one dance. - Come on, Eddie. No kiddin'. - Let's go. - One dance. One dance. One dance. One dance. Come on. If we don't go in, I'm gonna look like a chump with this money. Come on. - OK. - All right? One? - All right. OK. - Just one.

Go ahead. - Thanks, pal. I'm gonna be OK. - I know. Get down Get up outta your seat Get up, get down, get up and get with the beat You hypocrite! - Take it easy. - Son of a bitch! - Phony bastard pervert! - Shut up and go to bed! Come out here and say that! You come out here and say that to my face, you fuckin' lowlife! My husband'll kick the shit outta you! Hey, Maureen. Well, couldn't you? Fuckin' fat tub of lard! Fuckin' hit you so hard he'd fuckin' lose his fat ass! - Couldn't you beat him up? - I don't wanna. What do you wanna do? I want you to be a tough guy! - That's what you are, isn't it? - No. What the fuck is wrong with you? Eddie! What the fuck is the matter with you? God, no! Not too much! Not too much! Get off him! You're both fuckin' nuts, you know that? And you're a goddamn whore. He called you a whore! I wanna take beer bottles and smash 'em over people's heads. OK. I just wanna smash 'em. OK. Because I love you. What the hell are you talkin' about? Make some coffee, Eddie. Hey, Maureen, we got beer. You want a beer? No. I'm goin' to bed. Jesus. When you think about it, what an interesting thing a woman is. Tits and ass and... lips, and th... this kills me... hair. Where the fuck did hair come from? What is hair? It's like nails. Same as nails. Nails? Nails? What kind of nails you got? I don't have any hair on my nails. Oh, boy, are you pretty. You are so pretty. What would you do if I kissed you? Would you scream? Not me. We were meant for each other. We're all banged up. - Yeah. - Yeah. We do what we feel like doin', even if we get punched. Yeah. You didn't get punched. You fell. Not only once. You fell three times. OK. "OK," what? What are you doin'? Why are you doin' this? You know I love you. I protect you. I could never hurt you. I'd cut my arms off for you. I know that. We'll just lay here. We'll lay right here. Just make me feel warm. That's all I want. I wanna know what happened to you. - What are you hiding from me? - Nothin'. I wanna know who did this to you. I know you love me. That I know. But I can't stand for this. Gimme the guy's name and I'll blow the shit out of his ass. Somebody thinks they can screw with my wife. Nobody can touch you. Because you're Murphy. You're queen. You're the king. Was it that guy across the hall? Was it that fat slob across the hall? It wasn't? Then who the hell was it? Who the hell and the shit and the piss was it? I wanna ask you a question. Don't answer me until I ask unless you're clairvoyant. Which you could be, but you haven't been up until now. You're just pretending to understand to be polite. You can't see my thoughts. You can't understand... You can't understand my obscurity. Unless you have infrared vision, which... Do you? Can you see in infrared? Can you type 170 words a minute? Can you sew? Can you cook? Can you dance? What can you do? Nothin'. I wanna know. It's a simple question. - I fell. - You're gonna play games with me? Somebody beats you up, and that's OK? You come in here with your eyes all bloody, and I'm supposed to love you when everything inside me is telling me I'm bein' lied to! I'm gonna kill the son of a bitch, and that'll be the beginning and the end of everything. And then you'll know how I really feel about you. Not your fault. Go back inside. Hello? I need the number for Van Landingham City Ward, please. - Gimme a double. - Double what? - A Siberian Mist. - I don't know what that is. It's made of vodka, scotch, vermouth and various other poisons. Everything. Crme de menthe, beer, wine... What else is there? Bourbon, gin... Shit! Shit. Put a lot... Shit's good. Put a lot of shit in it. I'm having a Siberian Mist. Do you want one? - Sure. - Two Siberian Mists. What the fuck is a Siberian Mist? I'm in trouble. The world's controlled by a computer and seven women. One has brown hair, one has blonde hair, blue hair, black hair, green hair, one has no hair. Is that seven? What's the matter, Eddie? Love is so difficult. It's like horse racing. It's like perfume. It's like fog. It's like kissin'. There is no end to love. Cigarettes, you smoke 'em, you put 'em out. I got invited to a luau. What am I supposed to do at a luau? - Who is it? - We're from Mobile Response. We're lookin' for Eddie Quinn. Hi. You know, I changed my mind. He's fine. It's... He's all right now. It's just a false alarm, I think. Do you know where your husband is, ma'am? Not really. Hey, look. There's been a complaint. We got a call he's causing a disturbance. Now, I don't know what it is. He's drunk, he's pissed off or he's having an episode, but we either gotta take a look at 'im, or we call the police. - That's the procedure. - Yeah. Jesus Christ. I had a premonition. You know what that is? - It has to do with the occult. - It was all so clear. There were seven working-class ministers, all in miniskirts. They were working on their computers. - Psalm one, psalm two, - Eddie. Eddie. - Psalm three... - Eddie, you know I'm Catholic. You know I don't like that kind of talk. I'm talking about women, you asshole! I'm talkin' about nuns! Priests! I'm talkin' about bad news. I'm talkin' about love. But there can't be any love... 'cause there aren't any people. It's all temporary. I know. I've seen it. You get a cold. They turn you in. Did you see how that guy sneezed? Why the hell doesn't he go home to sneeze? What the fuck is he doing, sneezing in public? He's got the flu. He's got cancer. He's got T.B. He's got "shititis. " His blowhole is out. Do you know what they do when your blowhole's out? Nobody wants ya. OK. I wanna buy a drink for everybody. Siberian Mists for everybody. I can't do this. I can't. You know what? I'm not goin' in. I love my wife. She likes to break beer bottles over people's heads. That's what she loves. Give me another drink, Cooper. Siberian Mist. Make it a double. I'm gonna give you one more, Eddie. Then you gotta go home. Do you love her? I don't think anybody should kiss anybody they don't love. Why are you breakin' my balls? My balls spot. My balls spot! - My balls spot! - Loser buys. Oh, no. Now the monkeys are in the trees. Oh, shit. You're in uniform. I respect the military. Soldiers. One, two, one, two. I have a gun. You have guns. Fair. To draw, we count three. One, two... No, no, no, no, no! Don't you know I can fly? I can leap tall buildings in a single bound! - What happened? Where is he? - You just missed him. You wait right here. I'll get the car, all right? Yeah. Fear is a disease. I'm waitin' for a bus. I have no knife. I'm just like you. Little tiny bus stop person. It's hot, you know. Oh, much cooler. Much better. I'm on a code six on the A.D.W. Suspect at Mary and Riviera. Requesting assistance and backup. Get your hands up! Drop the fuckin' gun! Oh, no, you don't! You don't like me 'cause I'm from another planet! I'm a computer! Well, that's too bad. One and one are two. Two and two are four. Four and four are eight. 132, 133. 364. Seven million times seven million is zero. Anything times zero is zero. You can't control me because I know the details. - Drop the fuckin' gun! - No! Eddie! Oh, no! No! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Get his arm. I got this fuckin' asshole. Quinn? Right here. Hi. How is he? I don't know what kind of shape he was in before today, but he's not good. We've been running tests. I'm afraid the evaluation is not very optimistic. - What does that mean? - We're gonna keep him for a while. You know what? The whole thing, all of it, was my fault. You know... It was just a big fat misunderstanding. I think if I just go get him, he'll be fine. How long is a while? Listen, I don't know. It could be three months, could be three years. Your husband nearly killed an employee of this institution. The man is ill. Five minutes. Eddie? It's me, Mo. Murphy. Your sweet potato pie. Look at you. You got all strapped up. Can you hear me, Eddie? Can you hear me? Eddie, listen to me. I lied to you. I didn't fall. It was the neighbour. That fat tub of shit across the hall. And he did this to me, in the face. All of it. He did everything. And I didn't want to tell you... because I didn't want you to kill him. Because I didn't want to be alone. I think we ought to start out life old. We have all the pain, and we're feeble, and we look at our friends, and they're feeble. They're 100. But every day we get younger and we have something to look forward to. You start out old and then you get young. You can't take care of yourself, but... there's hope. And then, when you reach 20, nineteen, twelve, ten, every day is really a new day... and it's really a miracle. Eddie, you gotta get out of here. And then you're a baby, and you don't know your life is endin'. You just suck on your mother's tit and then you die. Goddamn it, Eddie! I love you. Don't you leave me! Come here. Put your face up here. I want to touch it. You gotta do somethin', Eddie. You can't stay here. You're a little sick right now, but as soon as you get better, you can leave. You get better in three months. You can leave in three months. Three. Put your mouth up here. I wanna feel your breath. OK, that's it. Time. - Dad! - Dad! - Dad! - Dad! So, so, suck your toe. Suck your toe to Mexico. All right. All right. All right, get me a cup of coffee. Jeannie's a butt-head. - Stop it! - No, wait. I got you. Girls! Will you leave me alone? You're driving me nuts. Go in the other room, OK? Hello. Miss Green. I'm sorry. I didn't get that. You miss green, or you are Miss Green? No. L-I am Miss Green. - Jane Green. - You don't like your name? No, I don't. Bad enough Jane without being followed by Green. I remember you. I haven't seen you for a long time. It's been three months. - You haven't seen me for three months? - Yes, ma'am. Three months? Not longer? I was told it would take three months for me to get better from the sickness I had. Now, I've been good. I done everything everyone told me. Well, to get well, sometimes it takes longer. Sometimes it takes a lot of time. It was a promise. She said three months. Oh, I see. How have you been feeling, Eddie? Well, first of all, I'd like to say... you're a very beautiful woman. And I haven't... been around the kindness of a woman for... some time. And I appreciate you lookin' at me with soft eyes. But it's hard to answer how I feel... 'cause good or bad doesn't describe anything. OK. I have your file here, and the evaluation is quite optimistic. No outward signs of aggression. You've been very cooperative with your counsellors. Though you seem to have some difficulty with your time and spatial equation, your rehabilitation is going very well. We've lowered your level of medication. Seem to be handling that quite well. Everything seems to be right on track. So, if I could just ask you a few questions, I don't see why we couldn't wrap this up. OK. I want you to be perfectly at ease. That would be a little hard, 'cause I know I'm on approval. What does that mean? It means I know I'm bein' judged, and I wanna say the right thing, 'cause I think I've changed... and I wanna go home. Good. You shot one of the attendants who came to pick you up. Why do you think you did that? I think I was frightened, and when I got frightened, I got angry. I used to want to kill everybody. I used to want to break beer bottles over people's heads. But you don't anymore? No. I just want to be normal. I don't want any trouble. And your wife? How do you feel about her? I love her. Even though she was the one to turn you in? Yeah. She hasn't visited you. - No. - She hasn't written? No. If your wife were to have divorced you, how would that make you feel? Eddie? Well, I don't know how I'd feel. I haven't seen my wife for a long time, and I don't know what she's doing. The reason I'm asking you this is it's very important for us to know you won't leave here with any active hostility towards your wife. - No. - No enmity whatsoever? No, what you... None of what you said. And if your wife were to have stopped loving you, what would you do? - What's the matter? - What? Drink your coffee. Good fuckin' morning to you too. Hey, Pop, kiss her. That's what she wants. Is that what you want, a kiss? Come here. Yeah! Well, do it if you're gonna do it, and get it over with. Oh, nice. Really nice. - Morning. - Hi. - Hi. You OK? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm just frazzled right now. My nerves are shot. Too much coffee and too many kids. - I'll get it. - No, I'll get it. You expectin' something? The institution. They said he was gonna be out today. - So? - So, I just... I wanna know if he was OK. You have reached the home of Giamonti Construction. - Joey Giamonti, wife Maureen... - Hello. Yeah. Who wants her? Yeah, I'm him. No, not Quinn, Giamonti. That's her name. Not "Guh-monti," Giamonti. - Joey, give me the phone. - That's right. Hello. Is he out? When? Well, where is he? Hang on. I don't have a pencil. Hang on one sec. Jeannie, give me a pen. Give me a pen. Thanks. OK. 3855. Yeah. The Ford? Hotel. OK. Yeah. Is he OK? OK. Thank you. OK. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. OK. Bye-bye. What the fuck you keep saying "thank you" for? Stop usin' that language around the kids! What? I'm sorry, guys. It's all right. We hear worse than that all the time. - Yeah? What do you know? - Like shit and bitch... ...and cock twister. - What? And ass muncher. - That's a good one. - Yeah. - And shut up. - All right, fine. Take your sisters outside. I want to talk to your mother in private. OK, Dad. Come on, guys. Fire Fire I'm Eddie Quinn. I was incarcerated three months in the loony bin. - Who am I speaking to? - You were in an institution? Went through the plate glass window three months ago. I don't know if it was a lack of vitamins, or the bad food, or the darkness, or maybe the drugs they put in you, but my hair is gettin' thin and it looks terrible. Oh, I understand. You wanna be how old? Twenty-five. All right. Give me the number. I'll call him. No! Well, I'm not gonna let you call him. Joey, don't fuck around. I'm not gonna call him, OK? I'm not gonna go see him. Just knowin' he's out there's bad enough. What is that supposed to mean? It means that... it took me a long time to forget about him. - Yeah, I never went to visit him. - So? But it means that I think about him every day. It means... I can't see him again, anyway, 'cause it'll kill me. What do you want from me? Turned him in, divorced him, married you... Why are you washing the same fuckin' cup over and over? So stop acting like an asshole. Let's just get through this. I'm the asshole, right? Not him? Not you? I am? Gimme his number. I'm gonna talk to this fuckin' guy. Just a little bit. I'm just going to talk to him a little bit. Joey, I love this guy, OK? I love you too, but I love him more, and I told you that. Come on. I'm happy with you now. Don't rock the boat. Don't rock the boat? Oh-ho, that's too uptown for me, honey. I can't live like that. What are you sayin'? "I love you. Thank you for takin' me out of the fuckin' gutter, "but I love my first husband more"? "So please don't call him because you might rock the boat!" What the fuck is that? Rock wha... Rock whose boat? I don't see any fuckin' boat. This is a house! Hey! I'm the guy you married, remember? You had a smile, you wore a veil, you said the vows. We didn't have those babies by osmosis. Somethin' happened. I didn't rock the boat then, I got in! You are such a crude asshole! I hate you! What's going on? Your mother keeps talking about a boat. Shut up! Jeannie, wanna meet your daddy? - You mean my real daddy? - Yeah. The one that your mother's... was in love with. The one that she married first, and out of those two came you. - That OK, Mom? - Of course it's OK. You should meet your daddy. You're makin' a big mistake here, buddy. Jeannie, go get the girls, make sure their hair is combed. We're goin'. OK, Dad. Rosie, Dolly! You're a jerk! - You want something to drink? - You got a Siberian Mist? A bottle of white wine I was just about to open... I don't give a damn what time it is. Wine? Good. Dash, pour it for us, and make sure the glasses are clean, please. I got a beautiful wife. She's all blonde, and... You know? I don't think it'd be good to come back from the nuthouse lookin' all beat up. It's too much of a sad homecoming. No, darling, too depressing. Don't worry! Your face... Ooh, it's gonna spank! I don't have much money. - You have a cheque? - I have no cheque. Oh, I have an Alaskan cheque. - Wanna see my identification? - I don't want to see that! I'm Saul Sunday. These are my babies, and we're gonna make you look beautiful. All right, where is he? We're goin'. You love him? That's the way it is. That's your business. But I'm takin' care of this. Where is he? - The Ford Hotel. - Ford Hotel. - I'll find him. - Right, you find him. Don't forget to pick the kids up at 4:30. Or do you want Willa to? - I don't care. - Fine. Willa. Do that. - Fine. - Fine! Figures. I don't believe you. All the... All the times you held me. All the fuckin' laughs we had... All the things we did together. Come on! You can't tell me you was passin' time. You can't tell me that. 'Cause I won't believe it. Believe it. - Come on, Dad. - Come on, Dad. We're ready! I'm gonna do this. And you don't get mad! Hey, Joey. I had a good life with you, OK? You want to bust it, go ahead. Go! Are you ready? Don't be surprised at how beautiful you are. Get ready for the new... Eddie... Quinn! Whaddya think? Well? It's... very nice. That's a very good job. Could I do one thing? - Whaddya wanna do? - Could I have a scissors? What...? That... That's much better. That looks absolutely awful. I think it's good! It's fine. OK, then. I'm gonna go. Thank you, Saul. You're very sweet. I love you. Can I kiss you? - Hello? - Eddie Quinn, please? Hold on. Eddie! Telephone call for Eddie! Hello? Is that you? I'm really depressed. You are? I can't find ya. - Jeannie's on her way to see you. - Who's Jeannie? She's our daughter. Daughter? She was born, the one that was in the oven. How long was I in? You said three months. Was it longer? Yeah, a little longer. Am I gonna see ya? You're not sick, are ya? No, I'm not sick. - I wasn't gonna call you. - You wasn't? Joey insisted that he take Jeannie down to see you. Joey? Who is he? Should I know? He'll tell ya. Oh, shit. You ready? I don't know what I'm supposed to do. You just be you. You can say anything you want. Or, if you... don't want to talk, you don't have to. I mean, you know, we can be nice. Remember, he's your father, and it's important that you meet your father. - But you're my father. - You got that right! I have you and you have me, period. Just because you didn't come from me doesn't mean that I don't love you as much as if you did. I love you just as much as your sisters. Probably more. You feel that, though, don't you? I mean, you... you know it. I mean, you can feel it? Yeah, I do. All right. All right, let's do this. Don't tell your sisters what I told you, 'cause I'll deny it. I know you kids. You like to torture each other. - OK, Dad. - Look at this place, it's a fleabag. Jesus Christ, I'm surprised anybody lives here. I'm makin' toys. This is your daughter Jeannie. I'm Joey Giamonti. Hi. Hi. That's a very pretty dress. Thank you. Do you recognize me? Almost. I mean, I practically do. Except, I was sick, and I lost something up here, I think. Are you very big for your age? Maureen must feed you well. Amazing, really. You been away a long time. Come here. All right, look. You've been on the inside for ten years. - Where? - In the institution. The kid is nine. Nine years old? Yeah, while you were on the inside. - You're nine? - Nine. - And who are you? - Who am I? I been Jeannie's father for nine years. Maureen divorced you. They said you was never going to get well. - Who said that? - Maureen and the hospital. Yeah. So I married Maureen and I adopted Jeannie. And let me tell you something else. When I found Maureen, she was dead. Depressed, pregnant. Really at the fuckin' bottom. Thinkin' all sorts of weird shit. And I helped get her off the drugs and the booze. We even quit smokin' together. You know, forget about that. That's not important. The thing is she thinks she loves you. She doesn't, but she thinks she does. OK. I see. Do you have a cold? Because you act like you do. I don't know if you really do or not, but you act like you're all choked up on phlegm or something. Fuck did you say to me? You puttin' me on? Daddy, remember what you said? Take it easy on him. Be quiet and sit down. You fuckin' around with me? 'Cause believe me, I'm not playin'. - I love Maureen. - No! I love her! You don't love anybody! She's my wife. We got a family. You just forget about her. She's not even the same person anymore. You don't even think about her, understand? Look, I know all about you. Maureen told me everything. OK? I don't give a goddamn who you are! You're not going to come in and take a shit on my life! You got that? Do you wanna hit me? Because... you act like you do, and I accept that, but I can't get contaminated again. So you just have to tell me what you want. What I want? What the fuck... What the fuck you mean, what do I... All right, look. We're havin' dinner at the house. Why don't you be there? - Why? - Why? To settle it! Why the fuck you think, "Why?" You got a problem, I got a problem. Daddy, that's not the way you ask people to dinner! Shut up and sit down! - Now, can you read? - Yeah. - You know where Chestnut is? - Yeah. - There it is. Be there, bring a friend. - I can't. Well, then don't. I don't understand why you want me to bring a friend. Do what you want. Just show up. We'll straighten this fucking thing out. I love Maureen. And I don't give a damn if you're married to her or not. If I come to your house for dinner, I'm takin' her with me. Here. Let's drink it. You can't walk in there with a half a bottle of wine. I can't go in there by myself, Shorty. You gotta come with. Inside? Forget about it. We'll be waitin' right here. Come on, Shorty. He said I could bring someone. Can't ya see he's nervous? Let's walk him in. You shut up! I'll go in with him. Am I supposed to sit in the car all fuckin' night? Yeah, you talk too much. Forget about it. Fuck you, Shorty. - Shut up. - I gotta have a drink. Why the fuck did they ever let you out? Come on, buddy. You're fuckin' up. We'll have a drink inside! - I broke! - You didn't break. Oh, Jesus. I wanna go back. - Come on! - Go ahead! - How do I look? - Oh, honey, you look great. That haircut I gave you, this beautiful new outfit. Makes ME sweat. Go get her, Tiger. Come on. - Come on, come on! - Come on, ya gonna be fine. Don't leave me out here all fuckin' night, Shorty! Shut up. - How long was I in? - Ten years, I told you. - Come on. - She said three months. Shorty, this is Joey. Joey, this is Shorty. Yeah, good to see ya. You told me to bring a friend, I brought a friend. Brought a bottle of wine, too, but I drank it. - Have a seat. - Fine. Where's my ex-wife? She's not feeling very well. But, uh, she'll be down. We have two girls. That's Rosie and Dolly. You already know Jeannie. - Hello. - Hi. If you'll excuse me for a minute... I'll see if she's ready to come down. Certainly. Your haircut's nice. Thanks. This is Shorty. - Hi. - Hi. What's his real name? I dunno. Shorty, that's what we call him. Tony Russo. I'm your father's best friend. Maureen. Maureen. Wake up. Time to go. Time to come downstairs. Joey! Can you sit down for a minute? - I never lied to you. - I know that. Well, I lied to him. I lied to him a lot. Anyway, I swear to God. You know how you love me? This guy goes right off the bridge for me. I think he went nuts for me. Anyway, I just want you to know it's not you. - It's just, I owe this guy. - Bullshit! You don't owe anybody except your kids. Now, you do what you think is right, baby. I'm going downstairs. I'll see you there. The problem isn't you and it isn't me, OK? It's the kids. I mean, Jeannie, she's big. She's almost grown. But she still needs her mother. OK? And the other two, forget about it. I can't do anything to hurt them. You see, we're a family, OK? And the key to that family is your ex-wife. She's... the spit that holds it all together, you understand? So what you're saying is kids are more important than you and me? They are to me. What are you telling him that for? Your fight with him is about Mom! It has nothing to do with me. - Hey! - Don't be so harsh. I understand what your father's sayin'. It's very clear. Kid shouldn't talk up like that. Shows disrespect. - Gotta be polite to your parents. - He's not my father. Eddie's my real father. But I don't want you. You're not the one I married. Yeah, that's right, and when she gets older she's gonna realize... that anybody can be your father. It just don't matter. Jesus Christ, what have I got here? Shorty, come here, will ya? Rub the back of my neck, will ya? Harder. Harder. Jesus! You want it soft, you want it hard? Make up your mind. I don't do this professionally. - Let me do it! - Yeah, let her do it. See, I can feel the knot. How's that? Is that too hard? - Knock it off. Jeannie! - It's fine. - It's good. - OK, that's enough. - No, he's still tight. - Take your hands off his fuckin' back! I asked you nice, and he told you. Now, take a fuckin' hint and sit down! What? Jesus Christ. Baby. Jesus, I... I'm an idiot, OK? I love you. You're my angel. You... It's... I'm jumpy tonight, OK? It's a peculiar night. Peculiar. - Can I get a beer? - You wanna beer? OK. Where is she? Drink that, and that's all. And don't tell your mother. - Is she coming? - She'll be here. Wait a minute. How do I know you told her? Who is this guy? What do you think of him, Shorty? What do you think of this? Hey, Joey. What the hell are you doin'? We came here for dinner. Nobody brought a piece. What are you pullin' a piece for? It's not that kind of an evening. Have a drink, relax, calm down a little. We got a little girl here. - Where the fuck you going? - Daddy, don't! - Shut up and drink your beer! - I can't believe it, Daddy! This is bullshit! I can't believe you brought out a gun! I don't want to talk to you right now. You haven't lived long enough to argue with you. You're just a glorified piece of blue sky. Leave me alone. I'm gettin' mad! No! Don't! Don't! Don't! Sit down. Oh, Eddie. I'm sorry, Eddie. I'm sorry. I did it. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm sorry. I told him I love you, and I told him that from day one. I swear to God I did. I did. No, let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Baby, I've been in an institution. You told me three months. I come out, I got a grown daughter. You never wrote me a card, never sent me a picture. You divorced me. You left me. Now, go downstairs and give that joker the news. I can't take any more. What he do to you? He hit you? What'd he do? Maureen? - Speak up. Come on. - Hi, Mo. Remember me? - Hiya, boy. - Long time. How's it going? Not so good, Shorty. - How ya doin'? - I'm OK. Must be pretty confusing having two daddies in one house, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah. I know I'm supposed to be the long-lost daddy you always wanted... and I wish I could be. But it's too late. Too much time's gone away. We missed it, you know? We missed it. Joey's your daddy now. You know, yeah, he had the time. And maybe that's a good thing. I mean, he loves you. He does all the daddy things with you. He's doin' all right, right? Well, that's good. That's very good. So m-maybe we could be friends? I guess. Like best friends? No. I don't want to be your best friend. You're gonna have a lot of best friends in your life. But I tell you what. Could we be second-best friends? You only ever have one second-best friend. OK. OK. - You all right? - Yeah. You better get downstairs, man. It's time. What the fuck are you doing? I'm talking to my friend here. Can't you give me a minute? Fine. But I gotta tell ya, it's gettin' fuckin' weird down there. You know I'm taking your mother with me? I know. OK. I'll go, then. Come on, Shorty. Let's do this. Tough situation. Lot of pressure. I haven't got the foggiest idea of how this is gonna come out, do you? Do you know how many times I dreamed this? Get your coat, Maureen, and we're gettin' outta here. All you need is a coat and some good shoes. Do what I tell you. - Joey, can I talk to you for a minute? - Talk. Never mind. - Jeannie, come here for a sec. - You leave, you leave alone. - The kids stay. - I'm staying. I'll get my coat. - Looks like a lot of bullshit! - Don't blame her! What difference does it make what she says, what she feels, what she thinks? For whatever reason, she belongs to me. - Yeah, you pricks belong together. - What, I'm a prick? Not you. Her. What, are you calling your wife a prick? All right, you two get out of my fuckin' house. Guys. Come here. Come here. Come here for me. Come here. Come here, I wanna tell you somethin'. OK? I just wanna... - What's the matter, Mommy? - Come here. Mom! Mom, you're hurting me! OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's just... I love you, OK? - I love you too, Mama. I know. And you. Even though I'm not here, I'm with you, all right? Jeannie. I love you. And don't you forget it. I love you. You take care of your sisters. I love you more than anything in the world, you know that? You're the greatest kids in the whole world. The greatest. Ah, you'II... Don't worry about it. We'll be fine. Hey, cut it out, Joey, OK? L- I-I don't need guilt trip. I got one already. It's all settled, and I talked to the kids... and I'll be in touch, OK? You coming back, Mo? I don't know, Joey. All I know right now is I'm leavin'. Tell the... That I'm sorry, OK? Oh, my fuckin' Jesus Christ! There she is! Oh, my God, Maureen, you look so different! Maureen, you feel all right? Where are the fuckin' keys? I got 'em. - Get the fuckin' keys! - He's fast. See? Now! Now! Come on, Maureen. Out! Out! Shorty! Hang on, Eddie! Hold him. I'm coming. - I'll get him. - Stop! Oh, just don't... - Drop the gun, Joey! - Dad! Get him off! - Got him? - Got him. I can always count on you, Shorty. Don't hit him! Watch his face! Stop! Oh, stop! I told you to stop! Maureen! - Don't! Don't! - Dad! Dad! - No, I want my daddy! - Get over to the side. Get over. Just stay! Right there. Get the fuckin' gun! Get the fuckin' gun! - Fuck! - Oh, Jesus Christ! That gun's gonna go off! The girl's out here! Will you stop? Stop it! You're biting him! Get off of him! Stop! Stop! It's over! It's over! She doesn't love you! She doesn't love me! She's de lovely. OK. He's all right. He understands. Get in the car. Everybody get in the car! Start looking for the fuckin' keys in your purse. I told you, I have the keys in my pocketbook! Why are they in your pocketbook? - Why did you take them out? - You were in there for hours. Yeah, but you didn't have to put the keys in there. What's that got do with the radio? - Give me the fuckin' keys. - Don't talk to me like that! - Here's the goddamn keys. - Well, give me the fuckin' keys. Jesus Christ! Nice house. Big. Hey, I robbed this from the house. Wanna swig? Why not? It's good for you. Come on! She don't want any. Can we just be quiet for a minute? - I don't wanna talk right now. - What's the matter? Can't you see she's upset? Leave her alone. But I see everything, all right? This is supposed to be a good time. - What's done is done. Jesus. - Oh, please. Please. I'm not deaf. I heard you the first time. - I was talking to Mo. - Why don't you put the radio on? I wanna hear some music. I wanna dance. I'm gonna start singin' if you don't shut up. I don't wanna talk to you, all right? - I wanna talk to you. - Shut up. - You shut up. - Shut the fuck... - You shut the fuck up. - I was talking to her anyway. What the fuck are you talking about?
