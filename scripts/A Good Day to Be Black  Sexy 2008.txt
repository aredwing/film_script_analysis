You know you had no intentions to finish it. How are you gonna start something like that and not finish? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, look down at my man and you'll see what i'm talking about. Oh, is that why you look so stank? - Mr. Hit-and-Run? - That's not even the same thing. You're wrong for that. That is-- I don't have a lot of time in the day. - I told you that. - You had time to come get some pussy. Why is your mouth so foul? Huh? Man, that's-- It's not like that and you know it. Actions speak louder than words, d'andre. Here we go. Shit. So what you got planned today? - You got some extravagant plans? - I don't know. I just figured we could go out and eat or something. You invited yourself over. Okay. Here we go right here, i got it. Me and you tomorrow, we-- Tomorrow-- Tomorrow, we can-- We can go out and eat. Your restaurant, your spot, you choose. Tomorrow. I promise. Me hungry today. - And you're already here. While you're here you should just hang out. - Really? - Really. It's a special occasion. I will cook you breakfast. Since when do you cook? You're here, i will cook. How about that? I'll cook. - You gonna cook? - I'll cook. All right. All right. I'll stay a little while. Little while. Only if you really really need me to. You do need me to, right? Mm-hmm. I don't wanna keep you here. - But wait wait wait. - No, you wanna go? You should go. - We can go-- - Ciao. You still sitting there? Be out. You gotta go. What you still doing here? I thought you left a long time ago. - You're funny. - You're funnier. Mmm. That looks good. For the food we're about to receive For the nourishment of our body and our mind, In jesus' name. Amen. All right, let's eat. Mmm. Mmm. - D'andre. - Mm-hm. - Do me a favor. - What? What? What? All right. There you go. What's-- What's the big deal? Please? Come on, man. What difference does it make? I'm saying the reality hasn't changed. - I take this-- - It makes me happy. - You know what? No biggie. - Uh-huh. Everything to your liking? Yeah, you did your thing. I'll give you that. Come on. Tell her to stop calling. Damn. Don't do that. I can make you eggs. Hello? You want some eggs, baby? No. No. No, i'm here. Yeah. No no, man. We can't do that deal. This guy's 20g short. Unless he comes up with his end, that's the only way. Yeah. No, i tried to explain this to him. I mean, he understands. There's no mystery. What are you-- You advocating for this guy now or what? No. For sure. All right, good. You want your bacon? I gotta go. I'm gonna head out. Thank you for breakfast. Where are you going? Right now? Why are you leaving? 'Cause i gotta go. Why? What's the problem? Today is a work day for me. You realize that, right? - No. - No? I came here from work. I gotta go back to work. Are you coming back? - No. - Why? - Not today. - Later tonight? It's not gonna happen. Tomorrow i'll call you though, all right? What? Whatever. You and your business day. I'm not your wife, d'andre. You don't have to give me your work speech. Oh, it's apparent that you're not my wife. If i wanted my wife, I'd be home with my wife. All i've been doing for the last hour is telling you Why i gotta leave, and you're constantly stopping me from my agenda. You have a problem with me cooking? This ain't got nothing to do with you. I gotta go. You ain't said you ain't had long-- It don't matter. If i say to you i gotta go Then i have to go. Why do i have to explain that to you 100 times? How is you callin' and invitin' yourself over to my house my fault? All i'm simply doing is explaining to you what's not feeling right for me right now. And you still haven't done that. What does not feel right to you? Because you're doing more talking than listening. You got a problem with breakfast? You should be receiving instead of broadcasting. Oh, you're not worried about it now, huh? You don't wanna hear what i've got to say now? It don't have nothing to do with what i do. I'm on the phone and i'm having a business call And you got the nerve to talk while i'm talking. How am i supposed to know? You speaking while i'm speaking. - I'm sorry about that. - Making snide comments while i'm on the phone. I'm sorry about that. I apologize. - It won't happen again. - Right right. Therefore it should all be good now, right? That's it? - You apologized so... - That's all that i see as the problem. Something about being real literal about this day. It's just the overall energy in this day has been - Real real brand-New. You got this-- - You are so extra. Oh, i'm extra? I'm extra? You're the one that barely came before you answered the phone. Business call? You couldn't even halfway take a piss Without the daggone voicemail indicator going off. - Business call? - That's bullshit right there. - Oh, that's bullshit? - Yeah, that's bullshit right there. What i say? Not your whole speech? You making it like because it's a business call - That made the difference. - That did make the difference. It makes more of a difference if it's not a business call. No it doesn't. See? That's the problem i have, Because now you're moving Into a whole 'nother area of things. - I don't know what you mean. - You don't know what i mean? That's straight up disrespect. And i apologized. You rocking the boat. You being dramatic. I'm not rocking the boat. I apologized. That was wrong. You got this real funky-ass energy going on with you right now. Why i almost had to wrestle your funky ass ring off your finger? You wanna start with that and we can work our way down? Yeah, because you act like because my ring is not on my finger, That somehow, i'm not married, right? You don't think that i know you're married? - I hope you don't lose sight of it. - How could i not? Your wife reminds me that you're married. I really could give a fuck about the ring. It's tradition, okay? When you come over here, the ring goes off. That's it. That's all. But not today for some special reason. But I'm brand-new? What's up with that? That's not new energy? Nigga, please. Come on. Wait, what part of the game are you missing? Are you delusional? You don't get that every time i come here To oblige you, i take my ring off? - Oh, you're obliging me when you come over? - Yes, I'm obliging. That's you. That is your baggage that you're removing. Yeah, you do wanna ride with this guilt trip now? I'm not tripping. That's what it is. I am your fantasy, okay? And i love that. I make you happy when you come over here, You get away, and that's what we want. You called and invited yourself over, i cooked, Now you got beef. What's up with all that? You got a problem with me trying to make you happy today? - That's what i thought. - I can't do this, man. - I can't do this. - But you're doing it. - You're continuing it. - You started it. - I started off trying to tell you-- - You stood here And started it with the big dramatic pause And the big "brand-new." - But you're not with it. - I'm gonna holla with you about this later. D'andre, you are not gonna call me later. Again, I mean, i don't know why i even speak to you. What you mean, you don't know why you speak to me? - Because you don't believe shit, - What does that mean? I'm telling you what's going on with me, and you ain't-- Because i know you're lying. I know you enough to know when you are lying. And you're lying right now. You're not gonna call me back today. Yes, i'm gonna answer my fucking phone. I'd appreciate if you keep your mouth shut too. Speaking. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Okay, all right. I'm going. All of a sudden the phone is a problem. The phone rings one time, the phone rings 20 times, it's a problem. But you're tripping like Something's changed. All this arguing, bitching and moaning-- I get that at home. I don't need that here with you. I'm amazed at how disrespectful you've become. This shit is just-- It's amazing to me. - You say you want one thing, But i can't-- I can't imagine you really do, man, The way you've been behaving this day. But it's cool. If that's what you wanna do. Are you talking to me? I thought you were still on the phone. What did you say? I was trying to be respectful. That's what i thought. Hello? Hello? I'm sorry, i must have the wrong number. Who are you looking for? - Excuse me? - Did you call d'andre? Yes, i did. Who is this? This is helena, who is this? - This is his wife. - Oh, he just left. Did you wanna leave a message? Who is this? Helena. What's your name again? - Bitch, i know you know me by my first name. - Who? Who? - Jade. - Oh, that is such a pretty name. Bitch. You are so far out of line, right now. I wasn't trying to be out of line. I apologize. - You're obviously looking for him. - Apology not accepted Because i know damn well you know if i call my husband's phone, - I was not calling for you. - I was trying to help out. I didn't know. Oh, thank you. I'm really trying to understand... - I do what i can. - ...why my husband was with you today? Maybe you should ask him. I'm asking you, bitch. You're the one who answered the phone. I'm not the bitch. I think you got the wrong number for real. You have a problem with your husband, not me, cow. Well, is there something i can help you with? Hey, you know what? You know what? You know what? How long is this been going on, helena? About eight months, jade. You love him? Maybe. Do you? What the fuck do you think? What do you think? I took the ring, the last name, The bills, the debt, the child support, everything! Yes, i love him. How would you feel if somebody came and destroyed your family? Think about my children. Think about how they're gonna feel. You're fucking my shit up. Hey, baby, it's me. Let's do lunch or something tomorrow, okay? - Call me. Hey, this is my second message. I know you pretend to be busy with your job that you're never at. But call a sister back. I wanna talk to you. Bye. Okay, dre, what is with the ice?
