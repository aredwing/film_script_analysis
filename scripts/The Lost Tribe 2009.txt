Big time, big time, it's all about the broadband these days, Joe. As you know. So what do you think? Ahhh, it's ok ... the market that we are targeting ... ... is tiny. Not to mention that your main competition is Bi-tunes. How did William Wallace defeat the English? What? How did William Wallace defeat the English? Who the hell cares? What does that have to do with anything? Just answer the question. I'm sorry there steroid boy. I don't watch anti-Semitic films. One word: numbers.

Are you out of your damn mind? There is no way in hell that I'm moving this boat with a half dead guy in there. I'm not going to jail for this. First of all, nobody is going to go to jail for anything. We'll hand him over to the authorities as soon as we get back to the resort. Otherwise, we waste an entire night waiting for them ... not to mention their red tape. And trust me ... we don't want to keep Mr. India Telecom waiting. He's right mate. We're better off pushing on. How is he? Vital signs are ok, but he's dehydrated and losing blood. - he really does need to get to a hospital. - Exactly, that's why we're going to push on. - What happens with the coast guard? - We're not going to wait for them. Tom, the sedatives not going to last forever and this guy could be trouble. Got a lock box? Down there. Heavy breathing.

That's strange. He may have started running when we reached the shore. Do you want me to keep looking? No. Let's gather what's left and build a shelter. Hey, Hey. How did this happen? It doesn't make any sense? I thought you were standing watch. I was. I don't know. It could have been the autopilot. I don't think so. That auto pilot was state of the art. Yeah, but those things conk out all the time. Conk out? Yeah. Storms or solar flares they disrupt the satellite link up. They go off the air. Look, for all I know it could have been stuck in the death stars tractor beam. As long as the insurance company buys it, I'm fine. It'll be fine. Trust me. It's all good. This is why the Dalai Lama says to practice detachment. So your not bound by the shackles of material possessions. It means we need to learn to let go. Yes Hey Honey? I think the universe trying to tell me something. Hey Sherlock, the wood needs be drier than that. Sherlock? We did that at school. What does that mean then? Watson is that you? He doesn't have to call me Sherlock. Must have their reasons. Perhaps you should have been keeping watch instead of making stupid jokes. And then we wouldn't be stuck at the end of this world. What do you think I am? A puppet? Hello? Is he? I think so. You see? I told you he had drowned. Yeah, but ... How did his body get here? Now that we have identified the body, can we go please? We can't just leave him like this. The smells going to get a lot worse as it rots. And it won't be long till something comes by looking for a free meal. There is a dog running around here, there's gotta be someone here. Besides ... We've gotta start thinking about food and water. But shouldn't we stick together now, Tom? No, someone needs to go. If anything happens ... Oh Wow. Hello? Hello? What is this place? It looks like some kind of military site. It works. Damn! My God. Gansus. - What? - Gansus research. They sponsored my research project last year on dna coding. - At NYU? - Yeah. They're very well funded by anthropologists. And very well armed. Give me. Hopefully it works. Works pretty good. Yeah, it's trying to find a signal. There ... I found it! FIND THE REMAINING TEAM AND TERMINATE What's going on? Guys? It makes no sense. Why did they leave all of this here? They must be coming back. Guys? Hello! Joe! Alexis! Here. Jesus, man. Look. - What? - Look. Hey doesn't our guy wear this? Yeah He was here. Let's go! Hey Chris! Joe! Tom! Over Here! What happened? I don't know. We found it like this. Mayday! Mayday! Does anybody read me? copy. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Does anybody read me? copy. When are they supposed to be here? I don't know, Joe. You heard them. They lost the transmission. Somebody or something took that guy ... and you want us to just sit around here and doing nothing? Please trust me. We're gonna be ok. OK? Ok like your dead friend over there? Oh yeah. We could go see him, but somehow he's gone! Oh hey let's all go to my boat. We can't. Why? Because it's gone! But for our leader, everything is ok. Joe, I do not recall asking to be your leader. Not his fault, okay, Joe? The guy went through the port hole and crashed the boat. - Anna! - None of us could know that. - That guy crashed my boat? - Is she serious? We don't know if that's what happened. She's laughing? After that foolishness solar flares and satellite links. - After I take my chances with you? - Stop! What? Tom! I was trying to save time. Fat lot of good that did. I didn't know this was going to happen. Don't go? Look, we all understand. We understand. Lying is ok! - Tom? - Anna, please. I just need some space. Hello? Hello? Hello? Tom? Tom! Why would he have gone in there? He must have went back to the camp. What? Why? The equipment was still there. He must have thought they would come back. I don't ... I'm going. Okay, let's go. Now hold on a minute. Shouldn't We wait here for him? I mean the Coast Guard could be here at any time. Fine. Wait, if you want. The jungle is a living breathing organism. And you just breathe it in and it'll be ok. Oh My God. Tom? Hello? Tom! So it was all like here, right Anna? Everything, all the gear, everything was here. Boy, they didn't waste any time did they? Where did they go? The text message said to find the remaining team and end the mission. They must have come back and left. And he's out there, looking for them somewhere. Yes, but how the hell can we find them? That's like looking for Noel Gallagher at Old Trafford, isn't it? Hey Guys? Over here. What is it? Looks like they might have gone through here. If that guy was here, he must have been in some kind of trouble. We're gonna find out, aren't we? Guys? Oh my gosh. Lovely. What else we gonna find? Chris? There's something up there. It's probably just the wind. Guys, what's going on? Everything Okay? Yes - Yes, fine. - Can we go now? Oh good. Who is it? Jesus Christ! He's here. Oh My God! What the hell kind of animal did that? The sternums been split open. No animal did that. What's happening? Oh My God. What is that? There is something up there! I've had enough of this. I'm going back to the beach. You can't just leave, Chris. You see that? That's not normal! You said so yourself! I'm going back to the beach to wait for the coast guard. like any normal human being, rather than running around playing George of the bloody jungle! Ok he is right. We need to go back. What if they don't show up? And what if Tom is in trouble out there? That's a risk I'm willing to take. I'm sorry, but I'm going back. We don't know what's going on! You are unbelievable. All this being a warrior goddess at one with the universe bullshit ... goes flying out the window once the shit flies? You're pathetic! Let's go. Tom Hello? Is anyone there? Hello We need to catch that dog. Tom? Tom? Chris, wait up. Chris, wait up. What happened to that yoga of yours love? Maybe we should head back. I'll tell you what. I didn't ask to come along. If you want to go back, jog on. Unbelievable. Damn! It's all been erased. I saw something. There may be something here. Yeah Kansas is canceling funding, it makes no sense, given that in the last three days ,,, we've come closer to the truth than we have in 300 years, The rest of the team decided to leave but I couldn't I told him that I needed another week ,,, to finish up the field reports ,,, of the specimens we've uncovered so far, They agreed , And then it happened, We found something! We found something! There was no doubt in my mind that this was it,,, the answer to a question that man had been searching for since the beginning of time ,,, the missing link in our evolution, The cranium was much larger than I expected ,,, and the eye sockets were small, indicating a limited field of vision, it conclusively proved that, as a species, we evolved, And Moreover, our evolution was not through a gradual progression ,,, from simian to Homo sapiens ,,, but that a genetic mutation had caused the simian to ,,, evolve into humanoid creature ,,, one which later became human legend among locals are that these creatures are still alive they're known as "La Tribu Perdida ",,, the lost tribe, There are other sites still to be excavated and many unanswered questions, I needed more time, but had to be careful, I couldn't risk this getting out, not yet, ELO RECOVERED WAITING FOR INSTRUCTIONS If the church were to find out ,,, HOLY BIBLE I wouldn't live to tell this discovery, NEW KING JAMES VERSION VALUE $ 50 MILLION ACCOUNT 54119571814 NATIONAL BANK OF ZURICH They were the only ones interested in stopping the world from knowing ,,, that God did not create man on the sixth day, Anyone who knows about this is dead.
