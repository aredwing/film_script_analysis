Do you have any idea how much this equipment costs? And what happened to the second button cam? Okay, Im not going to lie. There was an incident. You went for the crotch shot, didn't you? No. Okay, yes. But it wasn't my fault. Do you know there's this suction thing-- That's it! Man, Ive had it with you two and your crap. All you do is take and take And you don't even care about anyone else. Why do you two jerkoffs keep looking at your phones? MILFS. They keep texting us. Me, too. It's like They think we're dating or something. Can you two focus, please? I knew you were gonna break my stuff. I knew it. I let you borrow it anyway. Then really it's your fault. That's what Im talking about right there, man. You never take responsibility. You just get into all kinds of crap And expect it's going to work out. You should be embarrassed, man. I'm out. This is ridiculous. Are we assholes? You are. Hey, man. Thanks for being cool About me digging out last night. What happened with that? Nate lied to me, man. He needed someone to run interference. I'm gonna ask you something about last night. Sure. There was a real weird vibe. My parents fighting over you. You don't think They're getting back together, do you? I mean, because i love my dad, But Ive just never, ever thought That they were happy together, And last night was just a reminder of all it. [Cell phone rings] Who is it? No one. Okay, guys, hear us out. We're done. We're through. Right. The bet's off. I won. I did, but who cares? Okay, right. These women... they're crazy. Yeah. Hormonally unbalanced. Sexually frustrated. Menopausal. Fine. Congratulations. Wait. There's more. Look, we need to stop 'em. They call us 24/7. They know where we live. They just won't stop! Yeah, i have finals in two weeks. And? Um...we need your mom's house. Why's that? This ought to be good. Look, there's no way The MILFS will come to a party at a dorm. Yeah, and there's no way That people will pay for a party in the dorms. Hold on. Back it up. Why do we need the MILFS to show up At my mom's house? Think about it, right. What if they had other young guys to go after? Right? Other young studs To, like, tickle their fancy. Then they'd finally stop calling us. No. Aw, come on! Aren't you supposed to wingman for us? Come on. Brandon, Didn't you bequeath your debt to us? Sure. Then technically, You owe us. Fine. I'll do it. But this officially pays off my debt. Okay, awesome, because we already started Putting these up around campus. And at the MILF bar. Oh, my god. Hey, stranger. Hey, what's up? I saw you guys are having a house party. That's pretty awesome. Yeah. Not me, but... Oh. But are you going to go? Yes, but... i think Im going to go, too. I could use the opportunity To blow off some steam after all these tests. That is if you're going to be having Some of that sweet, sweet Microbrew action going on again. No. I really think It's just gonna be the regular kind of beer. Oh. You don't want me to come? No, of course not. Great. Then Ill see you there in a few hours. Great. Okay. Good-Bye. Good-Bye. [Cell phone buzzes] You haven't returned any of my calls. I know. We need to talk. Okay. I've heard that tone before. Look, it's been fun, all right? It has. But we both knew this wasn't going to last forever. I mean, i really don't want to hurt Anthony. Well, what about me? Don't you care what i think? Of course, but-- Sheldon talked to you, didn't he? What? Asshole. He doesn't want me to be happy. Holly-- Look, you are the first person I've been attracted to since the divorce. And what, now you're suddenly popular And you're just gonna dump me like trash? No. How's it looking? So far so good. Oh, thank god. She's alive. Best way to spend the rest of the year, you know? Best buds hanging out. Nice party, fellas. It's not bad. Oh, hey, man. Um, hey, listen, you know, It was really great living right next to you, you know? I'm sorry we didn't get to hang out more. Yeah. Sure. Whatever. What happened to your eye? Now he's captain asshole.

Yeah, yeah. Look at that. Isn't that just silly? I mean, why would you bother With someone with such a huge age gap? Maybe...i don't know, Maybe they've just got a real connection or something. So do you have plans for summer? Oh, actually, i have an internship, So Im going to be around here. So what about you? Yeah, i just live about 20 minutes away, So i, too, Ill be right here, Right in this area. Cool. Cool. Most of my friends are going home for the summer, So Im going to need someone To hang out with.

I'll be quick. I'll be here. All right. Bye. Bye. Hey, stud. You had me worried. I thought you were leaving, but you didn't. I was going to. But you stayed. That must mean something. No, it's over. Seriously-- No, not yet. Mom, we're all out of beer-- Aw, shit. No. Uh... dude! What? Jesus, mom! How long has this been going on? Since after the dorm party. What? Brandon... you made me feel so guilty, man, And this whole time you've been screwing my mom? I'm sorry. Sorry, man. It just... Anthony! Hey! Aah! My other eye! Aah! Alex! Alex, wait! What's going on? What's that noise? I still can't see--Aah! What the hell kind of friend am i? I, i... you know, with your mom, And i don't know why. I'm sorry, man. It's not cool. I'm sorry. And i let you keep thinking it was okay to feel guilty About just seeing my mom naked. I don't know how we're going to fix this, man. I want to. I really do. I just don't know how. And Im really-- I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Anything. I'll do anything. Just say something, please. Just say anything to me. Well, i screwed your mom, too. Huh? Dude, it was, like-- I'm sorry! I thought you were gone. I, uh... i can't believe... Im sorry. Mrs. Murphy. The moment i opened that door, She was, like, possessed, man. She wanted it. Drop 'em. What? You heard me. You got to see me. Now i get to see you. Okay. Um...yeah. There was no stopping her, dude. Oh, this is crazy. I am so confused right now. Stop! Just... call it even? I don't know. Yeah? Call it even. Could you give us a second? Look, about the party... Ill totally reimburse any damage we caused-- I just came here to apologize. Really? Look, Brandon, Im not going to lie. I think we had a really great thing going. But...you're right. This wasn't supposed to last forever, And after seeing what it did To you and Anthonys friendship, It's best that it end now While you guys still have a chance to be friends. And it would be really weird If we had a real relationship. What if we got together? You'd be Anthonys stepdad. Yes, that would be weird. See you around, kid. Well, have a good summer, ladies. You're going to be around, right? Yeah. I got some units to make up. I'll be here. You gonna be here? Yeah. Cool, cool, cool. All right. Sweet. I'm taking off. [Horn honks] Hold on. Is that the chocolate syrup girl? Is that her? Hey, dude, check it out. I can see straight down her shirt. I can't believe you're still seeing her. I guess Im a romantic at heart. Peace, guys. See you later. Wow. Hey, guys, Im out, too, as well. I have to see the ladies one last time Before i head out of town. They get one more round with the Nate-Man! Whoo-Hoo! See you next year. Later, man. Well, that's everything. Yeah, guess so. Are you going to come by the house later? Or later on? Yeah, probably. Hey, man, i was thinking. If anybody was going to be sleeping with my mom, I'm glad it was you. Dude, what the hell? Come on, man. What, too soon? Well, my dad wants to meet me for dinner, So i got to go. Said he's got something important to tell me. Call you later? Sure. Cool. So... so... how have you been? Good. Good. I've been good. I'm just packing. I'm moving into my new apartment off-Campus, So i just came by to pick up a few of my things. I didn't think you'd want to see me After the incident at the party. Yeah, that was strange. Yeah. But, you know-- That's okay. Anthony came to see me. He told me everything. He did? Yeah, yeah. He told me that he ended up dating your cousin And he didn't tell you about it, So it ended up being weird for you and your family. So that's all right. Don't worry about it. Yeah. But it was my fault, too. That's a nice pattern. Thanks. I made it myself. Brandon, is that a peephole? Yeah. It's a long story, But our neighbor moved out already, So it's fine. We have this whole place to ourselves. Good.
