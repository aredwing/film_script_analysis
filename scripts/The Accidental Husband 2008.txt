You know why? - I'm on tenterhooks, shoot. I'm looking for the real thing... you're talking about, but I wanna feel love. The kind where you're so delirious... you can barely breathe or eat. I'm waiting for Prince Charming who... will pick me up, sweep me off my feet, - slam me into a wall, and bang my... Let me stop you right there, Reesa. First, I don't think love... is supposed to deny you of your food... or oxygen supply. Love is supposed to nourish you. Well, I'm just saying I want the fairy tale. I want the excitement, the romance, you know? Yeah, I do. This Prince Charming... of yours doesn't exist. He's good for a few nights in the sack, but his charm will run thin, which is what charm does. Well, I hear ya, Dr Lloyd, but what I'm saying is that I want to be deeply... - and passionately in love. You want to be passionately in love. I see. You know who's a bigger flake... than your buddy, Prince Charming? His brother, Prince Passion. Reesa, if you are truly serious... about wanting to find real and lasting love in this town. I'm gonna have to dish out tough love to you now. - Uh-oh. This serial dating of yours... is a waste of time. You can't... find something when you don't know... what you're looking for. You're playing the field, right? Hoping that somebody will want you, when it's you who needs to figure out... what it is you want. Anybody can fall in love, but what you deserve is a man with... the emotional maturity to stay in love. Don't settle for a boyfriend... when you can demand a manfriend. I'm not really the demanding type. Don't go there, Reesa. Hear what she's doing, listeners? That is the sound of a woman who settles for second-best. Why do we do that? I mean, deep down we know we deserve better, so why do we keep lowering our standards? I devote a chapter... to this in my new book, Real Love, which come to stores on Wednesday. I've finally learned that unless... you demand real love for yourself, you're going to get seriously hurt out there. But how am I supposed to know if love is real or not? Spell it out for yourselves. R: is he responsible? E: is he your equal? - A: is he an adult? - Are you freakin' blind? - And most of all, L: is he loving? That's a ridiculous call. - Know anybody like that? - Not really. Hold out for it, Reesa. You'll be so glad you did. Oh, Dr Lloyd, you are such a lifesaver. Thank you so much. You're welcome. All right, next caller. - Patrick. Come on. - Where'd she go? Hopefully, she went to buy you a muzzle. Keep your mouth quiet next time. - Move it, move it. - If there is a next time. Showtunes. Showtunes. - More showtunes. - I like showtunes. - Obviously. It's sad. - Oh, there's the love doctor. - I hate that lady. - My lady loves this. - Mine, too. - Your... your who? I mean my mother. - What is that? - You're a beast. Next caller. Sofia of Astoria, you're on the air. - Hi. Hi, am I on? Yeah. Yeah, here we are. Let's go. I'm supposed to be getting married this... weekend, and I'm having second thoughts. - Second, third, fourth? - What do you mean? Thinking about calling this off a while? Well, I took your online compatibility... test, and I scored a 12. OK. That test helps predict... long-term compatibility, caller. - You're right to consider this... Sofia? ... very, very carefully. Forty-three per cent of marriages end in divorce. All right? You don't want that. How long have you known this guy? About five months, but he's... a really good guy and all, and... But... but... five months? Sofia, are you scared of being alone? - I guess so, maybe, yeah. 'Cause you know what's scarier... than being alone? You know what's worse? Being alone with the wrong guy... for the rest of your life. You got it? Doesn't sound like an average case of jitters. Wait, are you saying I should call off the wedding? I'm running out of time, caller, but you know, deep inside, what you need to do. Thank you for calling. Good luck. Knock-knock. - Mm, who's there? This is your publisher speaking. - Mm, we don't want any. - Read 'em and weep. - Oh, really? There's only one way to find out. No, no. I'm too nervous. You read it. 'The doctor is in. The first book from local talk radio... sensation Dr Emma Lloyd, Real Love, establishes Lloyd as the latest... khoja of modern romance.' - Latest what? What did they call me? Khoja, apparently. I don't know what that means. I don't know how to spell it. - K-H... - What kind of word is khoja? ...O... It's just showing off, really. - OK. - For a popular magazine... to review a self-help book... and pull out a word like 'khoja', 'from the Turkish 'hoca': A, a title of respect for teacher. - B, a wise man.' - Or woman. Oh. Or 'C, a sub-sect... of ancient Ismaili assassins.' Hm. - Iets go with A, for teacher. - I don't know. The assassin thing, I wouldn't throw that out. - I love New York Magazine. - Geniuses. - Should I write a thank-you note? Send a fruit basket. Mm. I love fruit. Yeah, well, that's... why I'm marrying you, my khoja. We're not done. We're not done with comments... - Ah. - OK. OK. Let's see. 'Dr Lloyd's analysis of love's... dos and don'ts is both insightful... - and trenchant.' Trenchant. What does that mean? Is that some kind of fancy word... for 'full of shit?' Trenchant? - Direct and incisive. - Gimme a break, smart-ass... What? I saw it on Jeopardy. Why didn't they just say, 'Read the book, ruin your life?' Read the sports page to us, huh? 'Physical gifts can offer... such insightful observations... into the human heart is a thing of wonder.' - Whoa. Trouble, one o'clock. 'She is chicken soup for the heart.' Oh, my ass. - Hey. Hey, Sofia. Sof. - Uh-oh. Here we go. I'm reading about that lady that helped... you plunge a knife through my heart. - Very trenchant stuff. - I can't talk right now, - because I gotta be someplace. We'll give you a ride. Hey, fellas. Stop the truck. Sof, come on. You haven't returned any of my calls. - Well, I've been busy. - Sofia, give the guy a break. Talk to him, Sof. Oh, don't do that, Sof. Come out here. Sofia. Please come out here so that we can talk. No, no, no, not you, sir. You can put your hands down. - Firemen. We don't arrest people. We'll hose you down. Sof. I'm not gonna go anywhere until you come out here. I don't understand. You know, one minute we're gettin' married, talkin' about names for our kids, and the next, because some fruitcake... - She's a doctor. - Of what, Sof? Of what? Talk to me, here. Patrick, it's over. I'm sorry. OK? It's over. I gotta go. All right, show's over, folks. Let's... keep it movin'. What are ya lookin' at? I met someone I like, but all... my friends tell me he's wrong for me. - What do your friends say? - We have nothing in common. It's just the sex. I'm just running away from many more... appropriate men who pursue me. - Because... - Afraid of the real thing? So they say. - There's Patrick. - Oh, Patrick. - Patrick... - Quiet. Leave the man alone. Can you not see that his heart is broken? How can he eat when the woman... that he loved abandoned him forever, virtually without explanation... and may be, at this very moment, cuckolding him with some other man. - Good night, everybody. Cuckolding? What's that mean? - Hey. - I'll be right with you. I'm giving Ann Coulter's... frequent flyer miles to Michael Moore. Ajay, come on, man. This hacking's getting out of hand. - You can get into serious trouble. Too late. Bon voyage, Mr Moore. See the clipping on love doctor's wedding? Who in their right mind is gonna marry her? - Whoever we want. - What do you mean? Check this out. - Who's that? - That's her. - The love doctor? I got it off her birth certificate. - Oh, I don't know about this, Ajay. What are you talking about? All you ever do is walk around muttering... about giving her a piece of your mind... or letting her have it or fixing her wagon. OK, for one, I've never said, 'Fix her wagon.' If you've moved on, that's different, and I'm happy you finally put this behind you. Wait, whoa. Maybe me tellin' her how I feel... and holdin' her accountable would be, you know, important for my growth... or whatever. What do you think? What am I, your yogi? I thought... you just wanted a little payback. - Let's do it. - Nice. Oh, no. Now you're married. I'm married. - I'm what? - Already married. - According to who? - 'According to whom.' - The state of New York. - That's impossible. - I have never been married. You must have the wrong Emma Lloyd. Emmaline Willing Lloyd? Your real name is Emmaline? A lot of things you don't know about her. - How do we fix this? Annulment forms. Fill them out. Have them notarised. Bring them back. - I can't believe I didn't know. Your husband needs to sign them. - Fianc. - Husband. - I don't have a husband. Then who is Patrick Thomas Sullivan... - of Astoria, New York? - Who is he? - I don't know. - He's your husband. His address is right there. - Astoria? - Queens. I know a lawyer who can sort this out quietly. - I'm sure that won't be necessary. It will. I've got a book to launch. Yours, I might add. - You don't think I was married. No. It's not that. It's just the timing of this could not be worse. - I know. I'm recalling 70,000 copies... of a moving memoir... by a new author that we've trumpeted... as the next Maya Angelou who turns out... to have plagiarised... Guess who? ...Maya Angelou. - I forgot about that one. I didn't. The headline 'Love Doctor: A polygamist' - just flashed before my eyes. - Hold these. On top of everything, Bollenbecker take-over. They haven't announced which publishers... they'll keep and dump. So one self-help author... who can't seem to help herself... from being married, Abdington Books could be history. I understand completely. Trust me. I'll take care of it. Everything will be fine... Oh, no, darling. Naughty choc-y. - You don't need this. You're right. Moment of weakness. - Go get 'em. - Taxi. Bye, sweetie. Hello? Hello? Hello? Excuse me? You're not Patrick Sullivan, are you? - You are? No. - May I help you? - I hope so. Is this 230133rd Street? Yes. It is. I'm looking for someone who lives here... by the unlikely name, Patrick Sullivan. Patrick. Keep going, tall lady. Keep going. Excuse me? Excuse me, sir? Officer? Hello. Hey. Hey, I'm sorry... No, no, no. That's fine. Um, can you... tell me how I can find Patrick Sullivan? - We couldn't get that lady out. She weighed 500 pounds. - She knocked you with her skillet. Frying pan. - Patrick? - Yeah. Ah. You won't believe this. That home-wrecking lady... from the radio walked in here. - I believe you. - Can I help you? - What's she doin'? Looking for Patrick Sullivan. - I was told he might be here. - Right over there. - She looked over. - What are you havin'? - Um, whatever he's having. - I'll bring it right over. It's walkin' right this way. - It's takin' its coat off. - How do you do? It just looked at me again. It's comin' over here. It's comin' right for me. What does it want? Patrick Sullivan? You're not an easy man to find. - I'm Emma Lloyd. It thinks I'm you. Help me out. Hey, I, uh... I dropped my chalk. I'm Patrick Sullivan. - This is my opponent, Larry Berlson. Oh. Mr Sullivan. Mr Berlson. How do you do? I'm here for the oddest reason. - We all are. - Here you are. - Mine? - Mind if I interrupt? - Knock yourself out. - I didn't mean... - Don't play? - Yes. Then you're stripes. Down the hatch. - No, no, Mr Sullivan. I'm here to... You don't drink? You don't play pool? Perhaps I can get you an herbal tea? Nine in the corner. We need another round. Mr Sullivan. Something very unfortunate has happened, - and it could make a mess of my life. I'm sorry to hear that. - It's certainly not your fault. It's your shot. Um, all right. Well, how can I explain? You see, um, uh, I'm about to be married. That is too bad. Congratulations on the other thing. We got a bride in our midst. Thank you. That won't be necessary. It's necessary. I feel a toast coming on. Wait a second. - I know you. - Excuse me? Yeah, yeah. Real Love With Dr Emma Lloyd. - You're that lady I hear on the radio. Yes, of course. You found me out. - Have you ever been on television? Um, no, but I have a book coming out. - I love television. My girlfriend never misses your show. Oh, well, has it been helpful in your relationship? Oh, you have no idea. It's completely changed our lives. - Oh, really? That is so nice to hear. Yeah. Tony. Here you go. - To the bride and ever-changing life. To the bride. To the bride. Mr Sullivan, as I was saying, you see, I'm about to be married. Be careful. Forty-three per cent... of marriages end in divorce. That's right. It's all... about picking the right partner. - So true. It's so true. In order to do that, my fianc. Richard, and I, need a license from New York... - Richard from dispatch? Asshole. So on an otherwise lovely morning, - we go to city hall... - To Emma and Richie. Richard. - And I don't want any more. - Hey, you're right. Don't want Richie to see... you hammered before your wedding. Tony. Give me that herbal tea over here. Herbal tea, coming up. Very funny, Mr Sullivan. Very funny. - I'll have you know I don't get drunk. You don't? No. My father taught me a good trick... to hold one's liquor. You simply recite... the presidents' names in order. - Out loud? - Forwards or backwards? Watch and learn, gentlemen. To Washington, Adams, Jefferson. Madison and Monroe. - Carter. - Carter. - Reagan. - Reagan. - Bush. - Bush. Do you think maybe we should pour you into a cab? - Maybe your fianc's worried. - Oh. That's right. That is exactly what I came to talk to you about. - OK. - Yes, Mr Sullivan, - it seems we're married. - Come again? We... are married. - I thought you were marrying Richie. Exactly. - I'm over here. - Right. Uh, yes, it seems that we, I mean we, are victims of a glitch in some... computer, somewhere, somehow. I don't know, has married us. - A glitch? - Mm-hm. I'll say. A big one. - Oh, boy. So, um, if, um, you'd just be... ...so kind as to sign these papers I'd... Ow. Washington, Madison, Adamson... - Are you a fireman? - Indeed, I am. I always liked you guys. Lights are out now. Sorry about that. Oh. Ouch. Hello? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh. Excuse me. - Good morning, Dr Lloyd. - Good morning. Wait. - Someone had a rough night. - Oh, yeah. Excuse me. - Oh, my. - I need the emergency outfit. - What? - The emergency outfit. Outfit I keep for emergencies. Richard called six and a half times. Last time he hung up. He was looking desperate. Worried about Bollenbeckers? - Can you get him for me? - On the phone? - Why do you do that? - It's fun. - The outfit? - Not here. - I had a date. - Oh. You know we're not remotely the same size? - Richard. Aspirin. Coffee. - Oh, and your father's... - Now. Please hold. Richard, line one. Richard, sweetheart. I am so sorry I didn't call. I was in Queens so I thought I'd stay at... my father's and go over wedding stuff. - Why didn't you call? He brought you in this morning... - with your mom's dress. - He brought me back in... - with my mom's wedding dress. - And your father's here. - She knows it. - What about Sullivan? - It's beautiful. - Emma? - Yes. I found Sullivan. - Coffee, Wilder? - I'd love some. - Aspirin? - I've got the papers. - Welcome. Not on me. - Coffee filters? - I don't work here. I know they have to be notarised. Can you get that? - Sure. - Don't worry. You have enough on your plate without... having to worry about this. Don't... Emma, your husband would like a few words with you. - Who? - Patrick Sullivan? - ... have them on you? - Sweetheart, can you, um? Can you hold please? Not a word. Hello? You there? Hello? - Ah. Mr Sullivan? - Hey. Let me get to the point. I left some... very important documents in your... - Richard. Phone. - Uh, can you just hold on... - one second? Don't go away. - Yeah. Richard, sweetheart, I am so sorry to keep you holding. - What's going on? I'll explain at the cake tasting. - I can't. I'll meet you tonight. But you promised. All right. Husband. Cell. Oh. Mr Sullivan? Mr Sullivan. - Wilder, here. - Mr Sullivan? Hello? - Your father on two. Gotta run, darling. See you later. - Gonna wait for your coffee? Nobody's got that kind of time. I don't know what you're smirking about, Wilder. I'm just glad to see you're having some fun. Does it look like I'm having fun? Wait. You drove all the way in just to bring Mom's dress? Actually, I was hoping... to lure you over to Bemelmans... - for a banana split like the old days. Bemelmans has been closed for years. Ah, well, my timing's always been a little off. Don't keep your husbands waiting. - It's not what you think. - I know. Mr Sullivan? Thank you so much for calling back. - Excuse me? - What do you want? - Car's downstairs. You're late. Mr Sullivan. - Yes. - Yes, about last night. - Yeah. - What exactly happened? I tell you this, you do one hell... of a Riverdance. It was quite a night. - That doesn't sound like me. - That wasn't the good part. - What do you mean? - I'm here. You're where? Hey, I'm losing you. Hello? Can you hear me now? Look, forget last night. What I want is a rather large stack... of papers I need you to sign. - I got 'em right here. You do. Thanks. You made my day. - Coffee? - Thank you. - I know a notary not far from here. Right now? This appointment took me three months to get. - Sounds important. - Cake tasting. - Like I said, important stuff. It's the wedding cake, and she's Marilyn Hirschfield, a respected cake maker. - These appointments are hard... I love cake. - What are you doing? Hey. - Scoot over. - This cake is fantastic. Shh. Please, please. Be quiet. - Can I get another slice of this one? You've already tried the butter cream. It's my fiance. She's on the fence... about the butter cream. - I am not. - Have any milk? - Sure. After this, we go to the notary? - Yeah, absolutely. How much is this? It's free, sir. Bullshit. It's free. - Here you are, sir. - Here's my milk. - Would you like a sip? - No, thank you. I'm not six. Holy crap. Cake down. I need a spoon. Don't worry about it. I got this. Here we have our dark Belgian chocolate... with vanilla mousse torte. - Thank you. - It's awesome. Oh, my God. Do you know if you mix these two together, it tastes like a Ring Ding. You gotta try this. No, no, no. That's all right. I'm not your baby. No, no, no, no, no. - Ah. Ah. - No. - Mmm? - Ah? - Mm. It's yummy. - It's super-duper. Mm-hm. Um, may I, um... may I just... have one more glass of milk, please? Attagirl. Milk for my bride. In fact, milks all around. Milks all around. - Hey, where you ladies from? - Germany. Wow. You must really like cake. Yeah, you gotta try this, and mix these two together. Hey, hey, can we get, uh, some Ring Ding things for the gals over here? Darling, I am certain everyone is being attended to. Baby, I got this covered. Don't you worry about it. - Quite a handful you got there. That he is. Impulsive, unpredictable. You never... know what he's gonna do next. - Full of surprises. But that's the fun of it, isn't it? - Of course it is. - It is, trust me. - Here you go, ladies. He reminds me of my husband... when we first met. Everybody... thought we were a total mismatch, but we had so much fun. And we still do 25 years later. Hey. What are you ladies talkin' about over here? - Talking about the men in our lives. Ah, boys. - Never mind. - How did you two meet? Oh, honey, you tell the story. You tell it a lot better than I do. No, no, no, no, no. No, you tell it. You're the good, uh, teller of it. - Please? - All right, all right. Sure. - You ladies heard of pro wrestling? Stop. Kidder. Oh, he's such a kidder. Kidder. It was a, um, uh... a blind date. - Oh? Yeah, yeah, we were fixed up. Yes. Fixed up. But not with each other. It was two separate blind dates... in the same bar. - Both goin' terribly. - Horribly. Think about those people who set us up. - Susie and Allen. - Susie and Allen. - What the hell did they know? I don't know. I guess he noticed me. Well, I mean, come on. Look at her. - A guy would have to be blind. Noticed me suffering on my bad date, and then the band started playing this... song, and it was my favourite song. And suddenly he was next to me and... he asked me to dance, and... I said yes. - What was the song? - Song? - Mm-hm? - Oh, yeah, the song. - Oh. - # Over night scenes... # Dinner and wine Saturday girls... # I was never in love Never had the time... - Honey, Every Woman in the World. Every Woman in the World. # Laughing myself to sleep... # Waking up lonely I needed someone to hold me... # Oh, oh, oh... # Girl, you're every woman in the world to me... # You're my fantasy... - # You're my reality That's it. Uh, that's the song. That was totally off the top of my head. Known each other for two hours and we already got a song. We don't have a song. How long is this gonna take? Emma Lloyd, Deepak Manaam Chaturvedi. - Mr Manaam Chater... - Deep. Deep. - Mr Deep. - I recognise you. The passed-out lady Patrick carries around. Yes, that would be me. - I brought you a little something. Oh, how very thoughtful. Do we have to do this right now? Delicious. - It's not unlike a Ring Ding. - What'd I tell you? I'm sure you'd really love a glass of milk with that, but I have to get home and changed for my book party. - If you don't mind... Don't rush. I'm a notary public. - I took a test. - OK, I'm sorry. Um, how long do you think this will take? Let's just review, hm? Signatures... check. Dates... check. My seal and you'll be on your way in ten minutes. - Oh. - An hour. A year. As long as it takes. Who can say? Anything you can do to hurry? I don't mind paying extra. - Trying to bribe a public official? Oh, this is ridiculous. I'm late. I'm late, and I'll send a messenger in the morning. That will be more than enough time. - I could bring it by the office. Oh, no. I will send a messenger. Thank you, Mr Sullivan, for your co-operation. Well, thank you for thanking me. Mrs Sullivan. - A year? - Patrick, I'm out. Out. You had your fun. This is too far. You should be ashamed. - A nice lady like that? I wanted to give her a taste... of her own medicine, period. And then I... I don't know. - She's starting to grow on me. No. Look, no growing, OK? No growing on anyone by anyone. No knees weakened, no shines taken to, none of it. Not on my watch. Now, go. You and Ajay have caused enough trouble. Out. Dr Lloyd. This way, please. Dr Lloyd? This camera, please. - Smile, please. - Beautiful, thank you. - Hi. - Eye contact, please? - Sign this. - This way, please. - And where's Richard? - Right over there. Thanks. - Hi. Oh. - Not too shabby, huh? - It's wonderful. I can't believe it. Sign these. OK. - I have so much to tell you. - Did you get the papers? - Um, they're at the notary. Excellent. Karl Bollenbecker's here. - Make that out to him. - Oh? He wasn't coming, then his... office said he was. Good or bad? How could it be bad? He hasn't even met you. - You look stunning. - Thanks. - What happened to your head? - Oh. Bird accident. A pigeon flew into me. I'll go take care of it. - Emma? You remember Dr Benton? Yes, hi. Nice to see you. Hi, Judy. No sooner do we leave you then, bang. I see your picture big on the bus. Oh. From the cake tasting. I felt so foolish, I went... and bought your book immediately. - Oh, that's unnecessary. - Later I was reading... your very sensible observation and your clinical judgments... - Are they good things? I'm sure some people find them useful, but I was surprised that a helpless... romantic can give such practical advice. - Me? Helpless? - Oh, yes, you. Hopelessly helpless, but let me finish. So my husband, Karl, returns... to the home and on top of his paper, there is an invitation to this very party. Isn't it amazing? When you say Karl, do you mean Karl... Bollenbecker. - It's a small world, isn't it? Yes. Teeny. Like a marble. Or a gumball. I had to drag Karl by the ear to come here. - It is a girly book. - Oh, no. It's not that. Karl can be very girly. Only that he... doesn't like to socialise with someone... - whose company he intends to liquidate. Liquidate? - Who, Richard? - Yes, but we can fix that. After this party, you and Richard... will join us for dinner. If Karl sees the man I saw, Abdington Books will be safe, I'm sure. That is unbelievably kind of you, but you see, Richard and I made plans... and so we're supposed to... Only one thing you're supposed to do, Emma, and it's to bring your fianc to dinner. Let's find Richard. Karl is waiting. Oh. Oh, oh, my husband hates you, but you saved our marriage. Do you mind? Not at all. Um, who shall I make it out to? - To... - Richard. Um... thank you. Oh, hey, hey. I brought your papers. Richard. Sweetheart. Please go with me on this, OK? - Remember Greta Bollenbecker? - Cake lady. - It's a small world. So small. Constantly shrinking. - It must be the global warming. I want to introduce you... - to my husband. - Her husband, Karl, is Karl Bollenbecker, who just acquired Richard's, your publishing house and he's thinking... of dumping you, Richard, and it. - Wait, I own a publishing house? Yes, and you're my fianc, so please just focus, concentrate. Got it? This is him. - You must be the cake dunker. - You got me. - That's my Richard. - Casual Fridays? I actually just came from soccer practise. - You play football? - Well, I'm no Lucas Podolski. Podolski. Well, nothing could beat Podolski. I own his team and he is a magnificent... pain in the ass, but a genius. You own the Bayern Mnchen club? Why don't you use Klose on defence? He's been under-utilised. - That's what I told that stupid coach. Klinsmann? Gotta go. - We agree. Excuse me. My name's... Ow. Jesus. - What? - Hand noogies. We give each other hand noogies. This is my brother, Carl. Your name is Carl as well? This is a small world. Yes, teeny. Like a gimlet. Yes, my tiny, teeny little brother, but not small. No. Big. Older, but not by much. - Carl, who I love so very, very much. How's it goin', bro? - Wine? I'm sorry, I'm suddenly very thirsty. - Carl? Carl? - Carl. This is Karl Bollenbecker and I'm Greta, his wife, - and we're so charmed by your sister. And her outspoken fianc... who seems to find fault with... every player in the Bundesliga. - But not Podolski. - But never Podolski. So, you sound English, but your sister... - Can I borrow Emma? Yes, but we both had... I'm sorry. A hand noogie. Who is that man out there pretending to be me? - I can explain. - He's wearing sweatpants. - Sullivan. Honey, you're stress-eating. I'm not. Go on. I wasn't at my father's. I was with Sullivan. Not 'with him' with him, but in his apartment drunk. That sounds... worse. I assure you I was fully clothed. Beyond that, I'm not certain, except he showed up today... with papers when I had to go to the tasting, which you refused to go because you're busy... - Get back to the Bollenbeckers. Right. Fine. At the cake tasting, there was this sweet lady. And she thought Sullivan was my fianc... and I just couldn't disappoint her. But this lady wasn't sweet at all. She was Mrs Bollenbecker, - which I didn't know. - You certainly know now. I do. Had I known I wouldn't... have let the whole thing continue. But it did continue until everyone... was quite taken with him, especially Mrs Bollenbecker when he sang. - He's a singer? - No, no, no. He's a fireman. - Darling, are you sure you want that? Yes. Yes, I am. What is he doing here? He came to bring me the notarised papers. But then there was Mrs Bollenbecker. I'm Emma Lloyd, so he's my fianc. - And I am tiny brother Carl. Oh, Richard, I'm terribly sorry. But, uh, oh, look. Mini-cupcakes. Look, Emma. I only got... about half of what you're saying, but this seems to be something that can be cleaned up easily. So before you harpoon what is left of my... reputation, I am gonna go in there... No, no, no, you can't. They're going to exterminate you. - What? - Not you, Abdington Books. Terminate. No, liquidate. That's it. Yes, chop it up in little pieces, sell it all off. Everything must go. That's why Karl wasn't coming. - But he did come. - Because Mrs B made him come. She made him come so he could meet you. Oh, look. I think he's really starting to like you. Oh, all right, I... Let me think now. Man owns so many entities, I can buy... a year before our paths cross, so we just have to get through this. A few more minutes? And a dinner. Tonight. It was Mrs B's... idea, so Karl could get to know you. - He's gone. - Karl? - No, Sullivan. He's gone. - But the dinner. - Get him there. - Oh, uh... - Is Sullivan even in here? - I don't see how he'd fit. Not now, Marcy. - Find the lioness within. - Now, you've read my book? Mr Sullivan, Emma Lloyd here. Here's the deal. My entire career, and my marriage to Richard, probably, are at stake here. Frankly, I need you. I really need you... tonight. - Hello? - Say 'yes' if he's there, - 'Oh, my God' if he's not. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Don't overdo it. - You got hit by a cab? - Good, nice touch. What hospital are you in? I'll be... right there. He was hit by a cab. - Who was hit by a cab? - Is that Sullivan? Oh. So it was only your foot? And you're fine, promise? Oh. Carl, he got... a cab ran over his foot Yeah. - Carl can't catch a break. Drink lots of cocoa. Bye-bye, darling. Richard, I was beginning to think a man... who would leave his fiance un-attended... for so long might not be as charming as I imagined. But, no matter. Please, join us for dessert. Karl, I know how important this dinner is to my future... with the Bollenbecker Group, but I've got this family thing. And where I come from, family comes first. So I'm just here to invite you to a party. - Could be a lot of fun. - To family. Above all else. To family. You look beautiful. Nice crowd for your upanayanam, man. - What's with all the white people? Party crashers. - Even that one? - No, that one's with me. Welcome, Emma. Get up there. Oh, I love my husband but he snores at night, and it only gets worse... My husband snores all the time. I just, tight slap. - Tight slap. - You look really cute. - Why do they snore? Check your mehndi for hidden messages. It's part of the tradition. When marriages were arranged, the groom would search his bride's body... on their wedding night to find initials. Ah. That's naughty. - Did I happen to say thank you? You did, and you're welcome. You're not the person I thought you were, Patrick. Likewise, Dr Lloyd. I can't. I have to go. Wilder? It's me. Can you come get me? - Hey. - Hey. Got any beer? - You did good tonight. - Thanks. You gotta tell her, man. Girls are way into honesty. All right. Goodnight, you two. Oh, um, honestly, Wilder. What am I doing? Running around Queens in the middle of the night, crashing Indian bar mitzvahs two... weeks before my wedding with a man... - who's technically my husband. Beats me, Em. - Would you like another one? - Mm, yeah. - I used extra eggs. - Thank you, Daddy. - I wish Mom were here. - Yeah, me too. She'd know exactly what to tell you, wouldn't she? You're doing all right, actually. - You still make a mean breakfast. I second that. He also makes amazing smoothies. Is there time for one? - Um, no. Uh, Lauren, this is Emma. Emma. - Oh, my God. - Hi. My mom loves you. I'd listen to your... show, too, but I don't have a radio. Which reminds me, is there a mall here, or a Best Buy or something? Oh, there's a Toys 'R' Us. Maybe they'll have something for her. Nice to meet you. Wilder, it's been real. Um, excuse us a minute. - Is there something wrong with you? No, no, nothing. I'm just late and I have to go meet Richard, so... - Don't jump to conclusions. - No. Thanks for breakfast, Father. Sorry I can't stick around for the smoothie. You don't know everything there is to know. No, like some things never get old, and, um... My car is here. Look, this time, you're really wrong, Emma. You are. Goodbye, Wilder. Bye, sweetheart. Daddy loves you, nonetheless. The golf tee white is stylish, but, um, I just, it's been done. And it's not as common as the... picket fence white, which is safe, but it's a bit boring. The Navajo white is bolder, but it's sort of in-your-face white. I don't know, um... They all look the same to me. - In what way? - In that they're all white. Yes, but different, I mean, wildly different. Are you not going to ask me about last night? Well, I assumed it went pretty well. Bollenbecker Group just renewed my... contract five years, thanks to you. Now, all we need to do is file those... papers and we'll put this behind us. Um, well... I don't have the papers. - What's going on, Em? - I don't know. He had them at the book signing. Between the dinner and the upanayanam. Indian bar mitzvah, don't ask, I misplaced them. - I had them in my hands. - Don't worry about it. - It's so unlike me. - It's all right. I'm gonna take care of everything... from now on. A white lie is still a lie. It may be a subtler shade of truth, but anyone's who's looking can see it on the wall. So I should tell him the truth. I'm saying that a cream-coloured, ivory-hued, matte-finished, half-truth... will erode the foundation of your relationship. - You're getting married soon, right? Yep. That's right. Your fianc must be a lucky man... to know he has you to keep him honest. We're both very lucky. Brother Carl. Didn't know you played. Let's drop the bullshit, shall we? It's Richard. - Richard Braxton, as you well know. Patrick Sullivan, as you well know. Hell, we're practically family. You behaved like a real gentleman... over a rather odd period. Emma tells me you did me a good turn... - and I appreciate that. - It was fun. I have to play the spoil-sport and ask for those papers... - so we can go separate ways. I'll bring them by the office. - No, that's not gonna happen. - Why's that? She and I have a life which doesn't include you, and I want to keep it that way. So I'm asking you man-to-man... - not to see her, call her, text her. I'm not much of a texter. Somebody in your circle seems to have a gift for technology. - What do you mean? The more I look into this glitch, as Emma calls it, the less accidental it seems. You might be technol ogically-challenged. Anyone close to you... - might be able to pull this off? Not off the top of my head, no. I intend to find out who did this. Something wrong with him. I know you've been there. We've all been there. Sounds like a crush. You're a grown... woman, let's call it an infatuation. ...far bigger problems than what you have now. You're dreaming. Wake up, girl. Do you... share the vision of the future? Is he dependable? You have to ask yourself. Smart, successful, beautiful women... cannot live on kisses alone. You may think the chemistry... has commonality with friendship. Take a look at the compatibility... quizzes in my book, chapter seven. - You'll find it illuminating. - Thank you. Thank you, caller. Hi, you're on the air. I'm reading your book, too. You call this a self-help book... - or does that term offend? - Uh, not in the least. - Who does it help, exactly? - Well, it... See, the thing is, I, um... I haven't... gotten to the helpful part yet. - Perhaps you're a slow reader. No, it doesn't tell you how... to find somebody to love, or how you... get somebody to love you back. All it does is tell you what's wrong... with the person you're in love with. That to me, well, that's not very helpful. Perhaps it is you who are wrong for... the person you think you are right for. What is it you know about me that would make you say that? - I don't know you. - You bet you don't. I don't. Since you called, here's some advice. Instead of blaming others for your problems, - consider looking at yourself. I'm looking right at my problem. - Well, stop fogging up the mirror. Nice. - Did you just hang up on a caller? I did not just hang up on a caller. Hello? Hello? Uh, hello? I think we've been disconnected. It must be those cell phones, those nasty cell phones. Thanks to my caller for calling... and I will be seeing you tomorrow... for the next Real Love with Dr Emma Lloyd. Are you crazy? How dare you come to my... place of work and make prank calls? I'm flipping through this and it was so full of crap... - that maybe I ought to call in. I see you actually bought my book. - No. I stole it from your party. Stole it. That makes sense. And I took your compatibility quiz. - Really? How did you do? - According to this, my lifestyle is wholly unsuitable to... any freak who would buy or write a book... - like this. Surprise. Those tests don't lie. New York City Fire Department. Official business. Please exit the elevator. Come on, ladies. Sir, thank you. - What are you doing? - Unsuitable? Is that really what you think of me? I don't think of you. You want to see unsuitable? Hey, security, - what's the story with the elevator? Holy. - My wife loves her show. - Delivery. I can't even get a guy to hold a door for me. - Step back, please. Can you fix the focus on that? - Zoom in a little bit. - There you go. I've had enough of this. Excuse me, sir? Doctor? Doctor? I'm gonna have to ask you... to please stop. Stop what you're doing. Come down to the lobby immediately. Stop it. Stop it now, please. - Sorry about that. - Which part, exactly? - Kissing you thing. - We just got caught up. - Carried away. - Lost our heads. I'm getting married. Yeah. You love him? I only ask this because... being that I'm your husband and... you're my wife, I have this... I have this vested interest in seeing you happy. I want to be happy. Don't you? What is happiness anyway? I don't know. You tell me, you wrote the book. I guess I don't know. - Patrick... It was nice being married to you. You, too. - Thanks. - Goodbye, Emma. Oh. Oh, oh. I'm sorry I'm late. I know, I'm always so prompt. Don't worry. When I arrived, I told them... to bring the drinks in ten minutes. - How's that for timing? Oh, what a day. You have no idea. Actually, I kind of do. I heard your show today. - That was Sullivan, I take it? Yes. The good news is I got the papers. Everything but page 127, and I'm sure it's in there somewhere. - We'll never see him again. - So why don't you look happy? I am. Well, I've got something that might cheer you up. Harry Winston finished our rings. Now, wanna have a look? Wow. See, the circle of eternity... came out great, don't you think? - No. They did mine wrong. - What are you talking about? - It's perfect. - It says 'Do I? Do I? Do I?' Not 'I do, I do, I do.' Em, you're under a tremendous... amount of stress at the moment. It's not stress, Richard. I just don't know. I'm really confused. Well, I'm not confused, Em. I know exactly what I want. I think you and I are the perfect team. Never doubted it for a moment. But I am not gonna talk you into marrying me. Take a few days... and figure out what it is you want. In fact, why don't we begin that right now. Richard. We had a really nice time. Good conversation. He was sweet and funny, but I don't know. Something's missing. - There was no... Exactly. - Spark? Yeah, let me... tell you something about sparks. Sparks cause fires and fires will burn your house down. Keep searching for good ol' Sparky, you're sure to get burned. Trust me on that, OK? Oh, I'm so hungry. Wilder. Your girlfriend's wearing my robe. Actually, his girlfriend's daughter... is wearing your robe. - Hello, Emma. - Aren't you my? So, um, why the big secret? I wanted to tell you. Your father thought you wouldn't hire me... as caterer if you knew we were dating. - Is that what you call it? That or this is an elaborate ruse... - of yours to get out of paying my bill. You have been worth every penny. There you go again, always saying the perfect thing. You've been together for almost a year. Why didn't you tell me? You've met so many women over the years. I thought I'd hold off... on this introduction... until we were sure of each other. - And are we? - Well, I am. I can't even keep track of all the things I've misunderstood. Sorry. Dad? I know I never asked you, but, um, what do you think of Richard? Do you like him? Well, sure, honey. What's not to like? I mean, he's perfect, isn't he? - Is that a compliment? You don't need compliments from me. I've never told you how to live or who to date. That's always been in your department. So, what if I'm, uh, losing my footing in my department... and I'm asking for a second opinion? Well, I think Richard is a... ...a good, safe bet. You know? He's the kind of guy... that you've always gravitated toward... and advised other women to pursue, isn't he? Probably the type of fellow that my... brand of fatherhood pushed you into. Look, honey, I mean. I've made some big mistakes in my life, some real whoppers, but if I hadn't I probably wouldn't have... been able to recognise the real thing... when it came along. You don't... have to be so right all the time. It's OK to make a couple mistakes. - Hello, tall lady. - Oh, Emma. Emma, you're drenched. Come, darling. - Move, she has to eat something. Quiet. Can't you see that she's not here... to eat or watch telly or chit-chat? She's come for the man she loves. Here you are with your 'come, come'... and your 'sit, sit' and your 'eat, eat'. You're standing in the course... of true love. Stand aside, I say. Through the beads, up the stairs, two flights. What? Yeah, it's raining. Figured you'd have the day off. Come in. Oh, here you go. Let me, uh, let me get you some dry clothes. - Patrick? - Yeah. I think I called off my wedding. Emma, I... I need to tell you something. - What? - It can wait. Oh. - How's it going in there, babe? Great. - We're having toast. - I'll be out in a minute. OK. # You're my fantasy... # You're my reality... # Every woman in the world What is this? And this? And this? Are you some sick stalker? No, Emma, it's not what you think. Emma. - Emma. Emma, wait. - I can't believe this. I saw the invitation. You're married? - No. No, I'm not married. - Liar. Stay away from me. Emma. Emma, I can explain. Yeah? What, that this is no accident? There was no glitch? No, you. You are the glitch. You Googled me, invaded my life, invaded my privacy, ruined my relationship. I almost called off my wedding for you. I trusted you. I had sex with you. You're just some sort of con man, scam artist, deranged fan? - Know what? Don't flatter yourself. I... What have I done? Richard warned me about you. I warn... people about men like you every day. - I'm worse than my own callers. Emma. Stop. Thank you. Can I show you something? Please? Do you know her? - No, I don't. - Yeah, you don't. Come here. That's Sofia, as in 'You're cordially... invited to the marriage... of Patrick Thomas Sullivan... and Sofia Idelia Maria Chechagua.' She's Dominican. We met on the job. She almost blew up a building... polishing those nails of hers. I carried her down 15 flights of stairs... and sat next to her hospital bed... until she woke up. - What does this have to do with me? She was a big fan of your show. Listened to it every day. One day, she called in. - You probably don't remember. - No, I don't. - You told her to call off the wedding. Patrick... Someone you don't know and can't... remember, you changed her life... and mine forever. I guess I wanted to educate you about that. About what it's like to have your... life ripped out from under you. I wanted to knock you down a peg. - You did. - Emma, I... - Goodbye, Patrick. - Emma. Emma. It's beautiful. I was just thinking how... how it's... too big for me without you here. Are you here? If you'll have me. Do you mean you still want to get married? I do. I do. I do. As many of you have heard, I'm getting married. People keep asking me if I'm nervous. Well, I'm not. My eyes are open and what I see... is not the man of my dreams, but the man of my reality. He's who he says he is, there where he's supposed to be. If you want to close your eyes and jump in, try the high-diving board at the YMCA. There's a generation of men... and women roaming New York City... in search of the holy grail dream partner. But until we learn the difference... between romantic love and real love, we're just searching in vain for... something that doesn't even exist. Here we are. Until next time. Ask yourself serious questions. Couples shouldn't have to hide. Play with fire, get burned. Irresponsible. Dependable? You can't trust what you lust. Does he give you a stable universe? Love has to be earned, not yearned. Stop obsessing about this old girlfriend... of his. Got it? All right. Next caller. It's a hard decision. Am I right? Well, caller... Trust me on that. Next caller. Based on what? What? Trust me on that, OK? OK, well... Um... I don't know. What do you want from me? - Real Love is just a theory. A theory, yes, but based on ten years of research... and study of sociological, psychosexual, statistical analysis of men and women... and their relationships. What if you're wrong? Hello? You still there? Take that one. Trust me, she needs to take that one. It's 15 minutes after the hour and... you're listening to Real Love with me, Dr Emma Lloyd. Uh... Yep, we got time... for one more caller. We've got... Patrick of Astoria. - Patrick of Astoria. - Oh, really? I thought for a second... you weren't gonna put me through. Thousands of people are listening. Let's... not waste their time. How can I help? There's... there's this girl that I'm... that I'm falling for. That I have fallen for. And, uh, well the trick is she's... she's getting married tomorrow. And if that's what she really wants, then I'm happy for her. That's very generous of you, Patrick from Astoria. There's one other thing that... ...that she doesn't know. - We're almost out of time. The thing that I didn't tell her is, um... - The thing she doesn't know... Come on. ...is that I love her. You know, I, uh, I look at her... and I see, I see my whole life. And I just thought she should know that. I'm afraid that's all the time we have, caller. This is Dr Emma Lloyd. And you're listening to Real Love. Where's she going? - Get in there. - OK. Let's see, we got, um, Chuck... on line four is looking for his soul mate, and Maria on line two just got dumped. So, Chuck? - Yeah? - Say what's up to Maria. How you doin'? Well? Do you really like it? - Perfect. You're perfect. - I'm fucked. It's an interesting segue. - Did you listen to the show last night? Yes. - He loves me. - I know. The entire tri-state area knows. The car's here. - What am I gonna do? Well, first thing we should fire her. - I heard that. - Sister at the keyhole, - just what you always wanted, huh? I did, didn't I? Instead you got you and me. We didn't do too badly, did we? We were a disaster. Yeah, we were. But I see a comeback in the making. Yeah? For a guy who's waited... this long to marry my daughter, he sure is cutting it close, don't you think? - Do you know how I know I love you? How? Because nothing in the world would... make me drag you to the altar again. We don't want to press our luck, do we? I should go see how Emma's doing. Let me know if he gets here. - Take it off, Marcy. It's crooked. Let me try. Oh, so this goes like this. And this... goes here. Here comes the bride. I can't do this. Excuse me, ladies. Could I have a moment? - Richard... - Wow. Look at you. Seems kind of silly, though, huh? Me in this dress, veil. Bridesmaids. It's like... some sort of play or something. No, you don't look silly. Well, you look extremely not silly... and handsome yourself. I'm sorry I'm late. I had to go back... to the city and get something for you. You forgot to file them. You should know by now, I'm not really the forgetful type. No, no you're not. Ever since you gave me these, I've been... putting off filing them for some reason. Why do you think that is? I love you, Em. I'm clever enough to know when I've lost. I should have asked you to marry me a long time ago. Well, maybe we just missed our moment. If you marry me today, you'll... always be looking over your shoulder. You'll never be completely happy. - You need to be happy, Em. - I can't stand it. Oh, Richard. It'll be all right. I'll be all right. As soon as we... can get past that angry mob out there. Oh, yeah, them. I'll handle this. Really? No, not really. In fact, this time you... should worry. I have no plan. Come on, help me up. Give me that candle. Would you just wait until I've left... the room. I might need this suit again. Richard? Engine 41, this is Great Neck dispatch. We've got a fire alarm and sprinkler... activation at Saint Paul's church. Great Neck? It's not even in our district. Listen, I know it's out of your... district, but here's the thing. You guys have sort of been requested. - How you doin'? - I had to talk to you. You could have just called. So, what's up? This. When I was a kid. I used to have a hard time believing in happy endings. The heroine rode off into the sunset... with what I thought was the wrong guy. One day, my dad found me crying. I was watching Lady and the Tramp... and he asked me what was wrong. I said, 'Dad, those two dogs... don't stand a chance. They're wrong for... each other. They have nothing in common. The movie's gonna end, they're gonna... break up and be heartbroken forever.' He pulled me in close and he said to me, 'Em, sometimes when you're really in... love you don't sweat the small stuff.' Are you saying we should run away together? Are you insane? You're old enough to be his mother. - Wait till he gets out of school. Who is this? - Good day to you, madam. - You were going to behave. I don't know how you do this. People... drive me crazy. It won't happen again. - Where was I? - Don't sweat the small stuff. I didn't appreciate... my father's advice for a long time. You have to figure out those things... for yourself. But enough about me. It's a quarter past the hour and now... for a word from our sponsors. This is Dr Emma Lloyd, you're listening... to Real Love. Please, don't go away. Haven't you got any cats to pull out of trees? That only happens in cartoons, Mrs Sullivan, as you well know. Indeed I do, Mr Sullivan. What can I do for ya? Happened to be in the neighbourhood, thought I'd stop by and say hello. - Why don't ya come here for a second? I can't leave my desk. - I have to be back on any second. Oh, come on. They can wait. Just stand up and walk towards me. - You didn't come to see me at all. Of course, I did. OK. And we're back... in five, four, three, two, one. This is Dr Emma Lloyd. We're back with Real Love. Susie from Morningside Heights, you're on the air.
