And one time I killed a bighorn. And I cried because my dad made me sleep outside in the cold. I couldn't feel my ears for two weeks. After that, I killed some deer. I was a good shot. Everyone said I'd go to the Olympics. They say my father was also going to the Olympics. In swimming. He even made it to the--to the-- What's the word? The state league.
