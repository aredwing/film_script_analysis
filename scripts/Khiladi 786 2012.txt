"He'll make it right..." "He'll set things straight." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." Two types of people can be found in this monetory world. One that earns, and the other that squanders. People also know them as husband and wife. Marriage, a twist in life... ...where the earner meets the squanderer. And some people earn from marriages. Like our very own Champaklal Desai. He has fixed 475 marriages till date. He could've fixed 500. But since he's included his son in this joint venture... ...he has broken the joints many alliances. We'll introduce you to him as well, right away. Are you happy with this marriage, dear? - Yes, father. Dear, ready to go to dais? Mr. Champak Lal. That's a fine groom you've chosen for her. Their horoscopes match so perfectly. Thank you very much. You should thank the Lord... I think the guests are here. Come on. Just a minute. - What? Uncle. Thank you so much for helping me out. If it wasn't for you... ...I would've lost my love forever. Dear, I believe love's more important... ...than horoscopes. Right. And where marriages are concerned... ...fibbing is allowed. Right? Yes. Get ready quickly. - Okay, uncle. All the best. - Thank you. Handsome and dashing, Mansukh bhai." 'This is Mansukh Desai.' 'Son of Champak Desai.' "He knows how to rock, and groove..." Take it to the dais. Yes. Yes, Jignesh. What are you saying? But he's a nice boy. The horoscopes don't match, I'll take care of that. What lie? Love's more important... ...even if the horoscopes don't match. The decorations look nice, don't they? - Yes. You want to know a secret. In the marriage that's taking place today... ...the bride's father was strictly against love-marriage. But we put up a charade... ...and now he thinks this is an arranged marriage. Where marriages are concerned... ...fibbing is allowed. Don't worry, I will arrange everything. We'll talk later, okay. Keep playing, this is a marriage. What's the point now? You just blew everything. "He's ruined everything." Champak Lal, the marriage is cancelled. Rascal. Useless. Mansukh. I'm dead. Fool. I might never fix 500 marriages... ...but you'll certainly break that much. Rascal, useless. What? Why are you beating him? Let him go. Don't interfere. Give me a stick. I will beat him. He broke-off the marriage that I had fixed. Papa. - Useless. Sorry, papa. Sorry, papa. But he said sorry. I wish you had said sorry before he was born. "Champak, I am sorry I cannot bear a child"... ...then I would've been really happy. Fool. Fool. He broke that too. Stop it. - You stay quiet. Quiet! Get out. - Papa. Get out of here. - Leave him. Fool. Get out of here. - No, papa. Papa, last chance. Papa, last chance. Stupid, fool, idiot, good for nothing, useless, rascal. Get out! These doors are closed for you forever. Closed for you forever! Closed for you forever! He's the one who broke that marriage. His father fixed marriages all his life... ...but he couldn't fix a single one. Its curtains for him now. That's enough charade for a day, everyone go back to your homes. "Mansukh, you're done for." Good time begins. Hey stop, stop the truck. What are you doing, catch them. Bahattar, did you see them. They brokee the barrier. That's okay. Bahattar here will break their bones. Come on. Great, boss. Real gold in pure butter. Billu. You did the right thing buying this barn. Boss. Illegal smuggling under the guise of pure milk... ...business is flourishing. Great. Great. Hey you. - Yes. Close the gates. Khiladi(player) is back. "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." Inspector. Leave quietly while you still can. Punjabis never come or go quietly. I've made inspectors like you disappear into thin air. Where's the boss? Boss, where are you? Looking for that piece of trash. Look in the trashcan. Boss, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? Boss, we didn't see a thing. There are three things in the world that erxist... ...but no one's ever seen it. Ghosts. True love. And Bahattar Singh's speed. Beat him. "RComee on." At least now tell me who you are. Name, Bahattar. (72) District, Malkanpur. Village, Tashi. Blessed with the grace of God. Wielding 786. Come on, arrest everyone. Catch them. - Catch them. Arrest them. Great, man. You really beat them to a pulp. What about that family from Gurdaspur? Those Gurdaspur peopplee did call. And they... - speak up. They... refused your proposal for their daughter. Why doesn't anyone want to marry their daughter with me? Don't worry, bro. They eentire orld wil look with awe... ...when you find your wife. - Why the world? Only I will see her. Bahattar. - Yes. What about the buffaloes? Distribute it amongst the villagers. - What? Each buffalo costs 20,000. Don't argue with me. We've apprehended such dangerous criminals. Distribute the buffaloes. They wil drink ther mik and bless us. And we'll catch more dangerous criminals. There goes everything. Fine, I'll sell the barn. - No! We'll build a school for the children here. School? - Yes. School. He's distributed everything. That's why they call him 'Khiladi bhaiyya'! "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "He'll set things..." "He'll set things straight." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "He's the saviour for others." "But he's stuck in whirlpool himself." "When will I find that gorgeous damsel?" "That will call me her beloved." "I count the stars, waiting for her." "I've turned into a lonely wanderer." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "You will. You will." "You wil find thee gir of your dreams." "The Lord will bless you with his grace." "You will surely find her somewhere." "Our farmily is unique." "A bride from every corner." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." Sukhi, ask her will she marry me? That's Simran, she refused your proposal four days ago. Then hy is she dancing ith e? Who does she think I am? This is the liit. "The moment will soon be gone." "If possible..." Mansukh, this morning an old woman said to me... ...Mr. Amol, give me 400 shrouds. Mansukh, do I really look like Amol Palekar? Mansukh. Hello! People are calling me Amol Palekar... ...why do you want to be like Amitabh in "Sharabi"? Come on, stop drinking. In life I could never finish anything I started, Jeevan. When I went to school... ...the teacher asked me to leave school. When I went out to play... ...children asked me to stop playing and leave. When I took the scooter out for a spin... ...my neighbour said leave him halfway. And today my papa said, leave the house. Hey, you will die like this. Like die hard. This shop here is to sell shrouds and coffins. Not to pick up dead bodies. You don't pick up dead bodies... ...and I can't shoulder the burden of my humiliation. I couldn't fix a single marriage. Not a single one. I couldn't send-off a single bride happily. Hey! Hey mister. Someone control her. She is out of control. "Beloved." "Beloved." Save me. Slowly! "Beloved." I am dead. Stop. Where are you taking me, Indu? Enough of the long-drive. Stop now. Alcohol spoils your liver. Listen to Jeevan. Listen to me. Your life will get better. What the... "Beloved." Rascals. Can't you see? You ruined my car. - I will... Who was it? - Indu! Indu! Indu! Forget it, they are drunkards. I told you stay quiet. This is your fault. My fault? But I'm here to marry you. Why you... You want to marry me. - I swear. Indu Tendulkar. Get lost from here. If I see you again... Now get lost. But, Indu, listen to me... Why you... - I'm dead. Now I've lost it. - Get lost. Now you've had it. It's a gun, it's not for fun. You're done for. She's a psycho. Who will marry you? Get lost. See, Jeevan. That's another groom that ran away because of me. True. You're real bad luck for grooms. Now. Who did this? Who was it? What did they do? They ruined my car. Come. Sit in the car. I will deal with them. Come, sit. Who are you two? I run this shop. I was sitting here shaving my beard... ...when this madam crashed her car. And you? - I am Mansukh Desai. I fix people. You mean contract killing. No! Tell him in detail. I mean marriage. I fix marriages. I say let's eat here and we'll go home and take a bath. The Lord won't mind. What do you say? - Quiet. The boss is here. Y'ers, that's TT.' 'He's been ruling the Mumbai Underworld for 20 years... ' '... but no one's found a single clue against him... ' '... and he's a big mystery.' 'The witness against TT went issing... ' '... under mysterious circumstances.' 'You can escape death but not TT, why is that? ' 'Watch tonight at 10:30, how T scares the hell out of people... ' '... only on Jago Bharat TV.' Sit. My name... TTT. Tatya Tukaram Tendulkar. Yes, sir. Who doesn't know about you, sir. Tel e who doesn't. I'll acquaint myself with him. My name's Tatya Tukaram Tendulkar for a reason. Tatya gave me strength. Tendulkar gave me fortune. For Indu's marriage... He's asking what about Tukaram. He gave birth to me, what else? I heard you're a matchmaker. Yes. You've already met my sister Indu. She studied in London, till 10th standard. Great, sir. 10th standard. Actually your sister doesn't need education. Exactly. I keep telling her. If you keep going to one place too often... ...it only brings humiliation. She doesn't understand. I tell her I will get you any degree you want at home. She's very stubborn. Very stubborn. Such girls are expected to be stubborn, sir... ...you cannot expect it from someone like Mansukh. Look, Mansukh. I'll do anything required for Indu's marriage. But I want a decent family. Decent family... - I do. I do know a decent family. I know a decent family... I'll get you one, give me 10 days. Ask for 13, so your rites can be performed after that. Jeevan! Don't interfere when I'm talking to a client. Hey! Calm down. - He's my uncle, Jeevan. He's studied only till 10th standard... ...so he doesn't have manners. But in Dholakpur municipality school, sir. Not from London. Anyway. But remember, I want a decent family. Yes, sir. Here is 200,000. advance. But Mansukh. I don't like people who break their promise. You can leave any task incomplete. But always fulfil the promise you made to TT. Yes, sir. I know. I always watch the news channel. Sir, I'll give you good news in 10 days. Otherwise people will get your bad news on television. Find the groom in 10 days... ...or you will go missing after that. Get it. He's TT. TT! A one way trip to hell. We could've escaped anyone else. But just ait and watch, TT wil surely crush us. Why don't you learn from your past mistakes? What a strange life you have. I can't live or die. Hello. Mr. Teller. Where will you find a groom for that crazy girl? Do you know anyone? I do, Jeevan. I do. There's just one man who can control that spoilt brat. Bahattar Singh. Who is Bahattar Singh? Khiladi 786. Few months ago papa and I... ...went to Punjab border for a marriage. That's where we met him. I told you so many times, but you don't listen to me. Hey, beautiful. Let's go for a ride. She's gone. Pappi. Rascal. Get the glasses. Get these things out of here. Give it to that fool. Why are you all so stiff? Get in the mood. Sit down. Do you want anything else, son? Pappi, hurry up. Get the glass, we're in the mood to... Brother. What is my fault? Will I wait for you to make a mistake? What's in the truck? What? - What's in the truck? Speak in his other ear.

I didn't see anything. I didn't see anything either. We didn't see anything too. Look, there are three things that exist in the world but cannot be seen. Ghosts. True love. And Bahattar Singh's speed. His speed's not bad either. Thank you. Thank you very much, you saved my life. Thank you. You saved my papa's life. Son. Quiet. Are you fine? Are you hurt? Only Bahattar Singh's enemies get hurt. No one can even touch him. No one can even put a scratch on Bahattar Singh. Are you married? - Oh yes. What about that family in Rudrapur. Did they call? - They did. What did they say? - It's the same old story. They rerfused for the arriagee after hurmiliating us. No, I am not. If you don't mind will you pose for a picture... ...along with the wedding procession. Procession? The wedding procession. Oh, the wedding procession. Just watch, Jeevan. Bahattar Singh will get married to Indu. But you said they're police officers. Where marriage is concerned... ...fibbing is allowed. Ticket! Ticket! Ticket! Where to? - Tasi. Tasi. Who are you visiting in Tasi? Bahattar Singh. Oh, you're visiting Bahattar singh. Then you don't have to buy a ticket. Decent family. It's a very decent family. They approved the marriage this morning. Consider that my sister's good fortune has begun. The boy's pure Indian. Pure breed. Have some sweets. Jugnu, you missed a golden opportunity. Our friendship could've turned into a relationship. How? - What? Look at this young man. Standing right before us. "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." Sattar. Don't make me open my mouth. Relations are done with decent people... ...not with powerful ones. Have you ever done anything... ...other than con, rob and loot people... ...that people will let their daughter marry him. Brother. You won't find a bride for him in India. You get a bride for him from Canada, Africa, China. That is also thee tradition of your famiy. Wearing this uniform... ...do you think you're the real police? Though we're fakes, but we do the job of the real police. We apprehend those trucks and hand it over to you. You don't do me a favour. I give you half the share. And I do that honestly. Here. 150,000. From the truck caught yesterday. Here. 50,000 more. Get new uniforms for yourself. You've ruined the uniform with your antics. Listen to me, Bahattar. What is it?

Son... - No, father. I feel humiliated. With God's grace we'll receive a good proposal soon. Looking for Punjab and found China. What is it? - No. What is it? - He's from Mumbai. So?

"O sweetheart." "I am so lonely, lonely without you." "O sweetheart." "Your memories..." "Your memories..." "Your memories torment me." "O sweetheart." "O sweetheart."

"O sweetheart." I am so lonely, lonely without you. O sweetheart. Brother. Look at him. Bahattar's looking so happy. Brother. I hope there are no problems... ...in his marriage this time. I will tie this knot. Today is Independence day. But I believe independence cannot be celebrated... ...by just hoisting the flag, but it should be felt from here. From the heart. Now I would request the minister... ...to say a few words. My brothers. First of all, I would like to congratulate everyone... ...on Independence Day. Today is Independence Day... ...so I want to release a few of you. And... those who are being released, their names are... ...Kishor Rane. Rampal singh. And Azad Reddy. My party wants such people... ...who aren't receiving any aide from the government. I want them to approach my party, meet us. I assure you, that our party will help them in every way. Best wishes and congratulations for your release. Best wishes and congratulations for your release. Come. Best wishes. Catch him. He's not fit to be released. Lock him inside. - I didn't do anything. These days it's become a fashion to slap poiticians. During the Independence Day celebrations in Jail... ...an inmate named Azad deduced... ...this meaning of liberty and slapped a minister... ...on the day of his release. Take a close look at how innocent this face looks. But he's a dangerous criminal... He's a police officer. You said you wanted a decent family. Hey! Don't mess my mind. Marriage in a police family. You want to send me behind bars! You're dead. Now you're dead! You're dead! Great, Mr. TT! Just great. Jeevan, you were absolutely right. Their promise is a promise, and our prormiser doesn't count. You just said you want a decent family. And he's decent. You never said he shouldn't be a police officer. You don't have so many conditions for a visa... ...as many as you have for a brother-in-law. Groom wanted, conditions applied. First of all, nobody's ready to accept your proposal... ...due to your reputation. If someone does take the bait, your sister drives him away! You need someone who is decent... ...and can handle Indu. And he's just that. He's brave, wealthy, decent. They're so decent that you don't need to buy a ticket... ...in the bus going to their village, just take their name. There are rmany girls aiting in line to rmarryy him. And he didn't accept it easily, I had to lie. I lied for you... that you're a police officer. What? - Yes. They askeed mee again. "What?" and I said yes, you're a police officer. And you ignored all my efforts. Baktawar, go ahead and shoot. First Jeevan and then me. Hey! Stop. What did you tell them? That I am a police officer? - Yes. I accept. But... if anyone finds out about your lie... ...and if there's any problem in my sister's marriage... ...then you will learn a lesson. - What lesson. One that will turn you both into 'seekh kebab's.' Yes, sir. When are they coming? - After two days. What's going on? Bahattar's getting married. What's this? Muskmelons. Looks fresh. Tatya sir, you need to memorize the Mumbai Police slogan. 'Sadraksanaya Khalanigrahanaya' (Protect the good and destroy evil). Mumbai Police Jai Hind! Please. For Indu's sake. Protect the good... bring Khali back, Mumbai... You'll get it. You'll get it. Sadashiv Amrapurkar Police... Sada Naka, Kala Naka, Police Station... What's this? What do I do? Hocus-pocus, Abracadabra... What the... No. Bahattar, where to? The trucks will be arriving in two hours. Jugnu, don't worry. You go ahead, I will join you. But where are you going? I'll just drop them around the corner. You go ahead. Whoever utters His name shall be blessed. - By the Eternal Lord. Look. Where are they? Coming. Get in line. Attention! Attention! Long live Mother India! Brother, which city are we in? Stupid, we're in a truck. Good times begin. Where's Bahattar? Run. Rascals. Stop. Bahattar! "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." Happy birthday to me. Eat it. How long are we going to celebrate your birthday in jail, Azad? Don't worry. Next happy birthday will be in my house. I'll be released soon. And just watch, I'll come for you riding a horse. We'll get married in Nalasopara. And honeymoon in Bangladesh. Bangladesh! Bangladesh! Bangladesh! I've been hearing that for three years. If this goes on then... ...this time TT will get me married to a police officer. Are you threatening Azad? Go ahead, do it? - I can't. Because I know... a criminal's sister... ...can only marry another criminal. Otherwise, later when the truth is out... ...it'll only create problems. So, when they come to see you, tell them the truth. Very good. So that TT's jailed along with you. I don't know what to do. Don't worry. I'm being released tomorrow. That's it. By the way, they're arriving tomorrow as well. But their arrival is inevitable. So is mine. What do you think? Do you want it in writing? Do you want it in writing? You fool. You know you can't read or write. Don't yell. Come on. - At least let me eat the cake. We will get married, Indu. Aazad. - I'll come out, riding the horse, don't worry. They came in a truck. Thank God they are here. We are here. Yes, mother. Shall we? Everyone get down. "The player..." All these people... They're from my village. Go and take a tour of Mumbai. Go on. And be back for the marriage. But first ask him. Oh yes. Where does Dharmender stay? Dharmender, he stays right here in Juhu. He lives in Juhu. Go on, setup camp there. Fine. Whoever utters His name shall be blessed. - By the Eternal Lord. Get on with the anointment. "He knows how to move, how to groove." "Mansukh Bhai." Sukhi, leave her alone. "Beloved." Indu's so glad to see you... ...that she threw a flower at you. I am a crazy, stupid Jatt (sikh). I strayed in her lane, it was a strange coincidence. She threw a flower at me, but along with the pot. Wonderful. He looks like the girl's uncle. ACP sir is here. Brother, talk like a police officer. I'll take care if it. 'Sadraksanaya Khalanigrahanaya' Mumbai Police. Jai Hind! "You will always have a good time with us." Punjab Police. Jai Hind. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful. I am TTT. Tatya Tukaram Tendulkar. Tatya gave me strength. And Tendulkar gave me fortune. And what about Tukaram? He gave birth to me, what else? Sorry. This is my police team. And this is my maid Mili. And Mili's brother Bhagat. Made for each other. What's wrong with Bhagat? That was my fault. I knocked him down with my car. He's been like this since then. But TT's so compassionate. He gave us orphans a place in his huge house. We just can't figure out what is bigger, his house or his heart. I bow before him. Wonderful TT. You're truly great. TT. I am Sattar singh. This is rmy brother Ekhattar Singh. This is my son Bahattar singh. And this is Ekhattar's son, Chauhattar Singh. You missed Tihattar. Tihattar! Where's my Tihattar? Wait. Stop. Mother. Stop. No, mother. Calm down. No, mother. Liar. - Mother. Calm down. Calm down. We all miss Tihattar Singh. My younger brother Tihattar singh... ...went missing in the carnival years ago. We all miss him. Forget it. This is my mother, Margret Mandella Kaur. Father brought her from Africa. And that's... Ekhattar's wife Sheen Wong Kaur, from China. And she... is Bahattar's mother, my wife. Olivia Martin Kaur, from Canada. Hello. Where is he? Where is he? Jai Hind, sir! An inmate escaped and I chased him here. I thought he came here... Hey! TT, you? What the... When did you become the ACP? Since I... gave the department exam. But, Bhalerao Kambli... ...you're still an Inspector. Hey, I'm no Tom Dick or Harry. They call me Bhalerao Kambli. I was, I am and always be an Inspector. Let's see who does anything about it. But why are you wearing the ACP's uniform? It fits me, so I wore it. But you've gone crazy. Since I'm the ACP... ...I will wear the ACP's uniform. I won't wear the constable's uniform. You're not worthy of wearing a constable's uniform either. You're a criminal. A criminal. Criminal! Criminal! Criminal! Criminal! Criminal! Criminal! Criminal! Criminal? Yes. I was, I am and always be a criminal. But who made me a criminal? The culprits of societtyy did. Because I cannot tolerate crime. So, I never arrest criminals, I directly kill them. Encounter. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Until now, only people called him a rogue inspector. But now his own department's calling him names. Very bad. This isn't right. - No, no, no. But, it's the court's job to punish the criminals. Sir, promise me that... ...next time you catch any criminal, you won't kill him. Swear on Goddess. What's going on here? What's this charade? I'm losing my mind here. Inspector Baktawar. Kambli's not in his right mind. Get him some cold water. Take him away. Cold, what? You goon, I will shove this stick... Take him away. Jai Hind, Kambli sir. He's an old friend. He's been an inspector all his life and... ...I suddenly got promoted to ACP so he's jealous. Jealousy. - Yes, jealousy. Jealousy. Where are you taking me? - Get in. You're locking me up. - Get in... I won't spare you. I won't spare any of you. - Come in. Let him stay in here. So, did you have a comfortable journey? We had a comfortable one, but I can't say about the others on the road. So, where's your station? I don't know. We never go there. Wonderful. I mean your house is really grand. We shed a lot of blood for it. Hey! Who will say sweat? Sweat and blood. We shed lot of sweat and blood for it. Indu's here. "Beloved." Please. Have it. Have it. Mili, take Indu inside. - Yes. Come. "O Sweetheart." "O Sweetheart." Was she digging for oil? No, she was only testing for endurance. Yes. She was checking if you're a real player? Right, Jeevan. - Yes. You will have to pass all her tests. Don't worry. I will pass all her tests. Even if I've to give a blood test. Great. Mr. Azad. Finally after three years, maybe... ...you'll be starting a new life. Try to feel this from here. From your heart. From my heart. And once you get out of here turn into a new... Yeah-yeah, I remember every word. Turn oveer into a new leraf. Get an honest living. Etcetera. Etcetera. Right? No matter what I do on the outside... ...I am never coming back here. Thank God. Once you're out of that cell, we can get it painted. There's one thing. Can I get a cigarette? - No! Listen. Let's go out. That way... even I can smoke one. What happened, Azad? Azad never involves anyone in his wrong deeds. Great. Such thoughts are rare today. Indu! Catch the rascal. Bring him back. You rascal. - I didn't do anything... We'll teach you a lesson. Get in. - What is my fault? I am getting married today. You can forget about that. Who is disturbing me? "Beloved." What is it? How about a long-drive? - Let's go. Wear your slippers. We'll be taking the car, not going bare-foot. "Beloved." By the way, you like driving, don't you? You know, so do I. You won't anymore. Indu, careful. Indu, you drive really well. "Beloved." I use this just as well. - Action. Action. Indu, you're just my type. - What do you mean? How did I get here? Speed, darling. Speed. Now let's see whether this car only purrs... ...or does it roar as well. It flies too. "The player." "We'll party..." "We'll party..." "We'll party tonight." "Together we're dynamite." "We'll party tonight." "Together we're dynamite." "I didn't come riding a horse." "I've brought this beautiful car." "I didn't come riding a horse." "I've brought this beautiful car." "Let's go for a long-drive." "Let's go for a long-drive." "Let's go for a long-drive with me, sweetheart." "Give me a moment of peace." "I've left those lonely lanes behind." "I came here to watch your grace." "We'll party tonight." "Together we're dynamite." "I didn't come riding a horse." "I've brought this beautiful car." "Let's go for a long-drive." "Let's go for a long-drive." "Let's go for a long-drive with me, sweetheart." Sweetheart, we returned just as we left. Goodnight. Right away. Hey! Hey, stop! We've decided! Engagement on Tuesday. And marriage on Wednesday. Give me a hug. I can't believe you did this. You handled everything. I can't believe it. Don't go with a sad face, it'll only bear bad news. Just watch, we'll have no more problems now. Hello. Mansukh. What are you doing up there? You should be thankful that I didn't go any higher. I am still alive. And that's more important. No, no, tell us. Is there something lacking. Tell us. Come up. Come up and I will tell you. Come here. Come quickly. Careful. Yes, tell us the problem. What's wrong? Something lacking in our hospitality? Why the sad face? For the first time I'm in love... ...but she humiliated me instead. Who is it? Tell us. Mili. Is that all? Let Bahattar get married... ...then I will set you and Mili up as well. Really? - I never lie. Get Bahattar married quickly. Right, after that you and Mili. But I believe you. All I want is Bahattar to get married. He returns to Punjab with sister-in-law Indu. And concentrates on his work. - Yes, your duty must be suffering. No, no. It's not about the loss. We'll recover the losses with two trucks. I want Bahattar to concentrate more on his fields. Grows crops. Sister-in-law Indu brings food for him. And his police job. Let the police do that. We are not their slaves. Don't you work for the police? We're fake police. What good are the police? Wear the uniform and anyone can be a police. It's more important to be a better person. Like these people. Brother Sattar raised an orphan like me. Brother Ekhattar taught me to use a gun. Bahattar employed me in his job of plundering trucks. He made this poor man successful. All I want now is Bahattar to get married... ...and return home with sister-in-law Indu... ...and tell him to make an honest living. Until now we survived on the trucks that crossed borders. Tomorro, if anything goers wrong... ...I swear I won't be able to forgive myself. What the... This alcohol's truly amazing. I am drinking and he's drunk. Why do you drink if you can't digest it? Bahattar Singh. "The player." "The player." "He's the player, buddy." Bahattar Singh! Bahattar Singh! What's wrong, Mansukh? Why are you screaming? You lied to me? Name Bahattar, but you don't live up to it. Bahattar Singh, stray dogs can run behind cars... ...but they can never drive it. What did you think? I won't find out? Bahattar Singh, you must have heard the saying. Which one? No matter how big the mango grows... ...it always hangs under the branch. No, I haven't heard this saying. But I've heard something similar. It's like this... - so be it. And quietly... Punjabis never come or go quietly? Bahattar Singh. Mansukh. You can only hit me in your dreams. In reality, I would've had you for dessert. Dessert? How? Angry milkshake. "Mansukh's done for." Who beat you up? Bahattar. TT kiled me. TT sir, you're istakeen about us... ...and we were mistaken about Bahattar. TT sir, don't punish us so cruerlly. TT... Your mistaken identity gave me the wrong family. I feel soon I will need the goods that I sell in my shop. Allah. Please, help me. Jeevan, one has to make small sacrifices... ...for big achievements. What the... Any doubts. Why does Jeevanlal Pranlal Dcosta make a sacrifice... ...for his sister's marriage? You make the sacrifice if you want to. Get well soon. Okay, Jeevan. I will make the sacrifice. But I will make this marriage successful. And even if I die in the process... ...then at least my father will keep my photo at home. Indu madam, where are you going? What authority do you have to ask me that? - He does. Everyone follows my orders in this house. You're getting engaged in three days. Before that you won't step out of the house. But... - I don't want to hear a thing. All I want to hear now are the trumpets blaring. Brother, you're fixing my marriage by telling a lie. This is wrong. Look. If a lie can fill your life with happiness... ...then I am ready. Your future's much more important for me. Once you get married in a decent family... ...I will feel relieved. This is nice. My in-laws will be decent, but not my brother. Who says so? I've decided. After your marriage, I will settle down in Khandala. Until now I've extorted money as the mafia... ...but now I want to ask for the newspaper as a neighbour. I want to sit under the shade of trees in my garden... ...instead of the refuge of my bodyguards. Brother. You cannot justify your lies by saying this. And I don't want to either. I just want to see you married. And now you will set foot out... ...only when you leave in a palanquin. Get it. Only three days left for your engagement. Once you're married I'm sure you'll get promoted... ...and Indu will be lucky for you, I am certain. Your phone's ringing. Hello. Why do you call if you can't speak? Rascal, dog. Who was it? I don't know, just likes to trouble me. Someone's having fun. I can surely tell that Indu has immense love for you in her heart. So why doesn't she express it? I am so tensed. I've passed all her tests. Does she want to kill me now? She's shy. She feels shy. Take her to a hotel. Invite her to dinner. Be a little romantic, and then watch. Will she then express her love? - Of course. Haven't you heard that song? - Which one? "Let's go to a disco, let's eat out in a hotel." "Let's get romantic, darling." "Let's get romantic, darling." So shall we? - Disco? No, let's first inform the one you want to take to the disco. What is it? - He wants to say something. Go ahead, tell her. I... l... You say it, I feel shy. He wants to take you to the disco. Disco? - Yes. Go on. Hello. - Indu, its Azad. Where are you? - I am at home. What are you doing at home? Do you think I am crazy to be released today? Listen to me. I've guests at home. She's talking about you. Guest. I didn't ask anyone to pick me up... ...because I thought you will come pick me up. Now do you want me to take the bus? I don't want excuses. I told you there's a problem. A fly ruined my life, and you're telling me about personal problems. Are you coming or not? We'll get married today. Today? - Why? What's wrong? Why are you giving such a loud reaction? You do love me, don't you? Of course I love you. She's talking about you, that she loves you. To herr friend. I don't want to hear a thing. Come here right now. Just a minute. What time? Let's go. Will she be there? - Of course she will. Come on. I hope she doesn't leave me there stranded like a fool. Come on. Not at all. Meet me at 9:30, Lokhandwala Circle. Fine, be there on time. Cigarette. Goodbye. - Good boy. Goodbye. - Good boy. Sir, this time he really left. Bahattar, help me down. You're still hanging. I told you let's take the car. I cannot travel in that small car. The truck's a manly vehicle. I only travel in the truck. Come on. Come on. Vaet. Park ther truck. Hey, it's RDB in the house. Redefined as RD Burman. "Call the fire brigade." "Call the fire brigade." "Call the fire brigade." "My desires are on fire." "Beloved." "Beloved." "Beloved." "I'm waiting just for you."

Don't stress yourself, lady. All the women in our house are foreigners. We're lacking Indians. Excuse me, sister. Beloved. We won't tolerate it any longer. Down with dictatorship! Sir, these people are advancing ahead. Don't move anyone. Everyone go back! Charge! Here I am. Wait, I'm coming. Hey, you dropped your flag. You will never learn. - I... You will never learn, rascal. Staging a riot, are you? - But I... Arrest him. Come on. Come with me. - But I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. Indu, we will get married. Don't lose hope, Indu. I'll be back. I'll be back! Indu. Indu. I'm right here. Indu. Why did you come out? The one who's suppposed to, isn't coming out... ...so I thought why don't I come out. Who are you talking about? I didn't understand. I will explain you. Indu. Don't you have anything better to see In Mumbai... ...that you brought me to see the jail. Come in. - Do I have to go in? Why, are you scared of the jail? "I won't stop following you, darling." "Even if you throw me in jail." Hello. Bahattar. This is Azad. Hello. My boyfriend. And I want to marry him. And, Azad. This is Bahattar Singh. Punjab Police. And he wants to marry me. Punjab police appoints such idiots these days. Officers like you... are no match for Azad. Right now, you're the one behind bars. Hey! Even if I'm behind bars, I'm still the lion. And you're sticking your hand in the lion's mouth. The lions in the junglee don't scare e... ...and you look tame. I fear that if I roar, you might go stand up. See, you even stood up. Why you... If I were outside, I would've killed you. Who do you think you are? Name, Bahattar. District, Malkhanpur. Village, Tasi. Blessed with the grace of Lord. Look here. Wielding 786. If you were outside, you would be praying to Lord... ...that "Lord, why am I outside". Bahattar, I will kill you. I'll make mincemeat out of you. It'll give you a bad stomach. Stray dogs can't digest meat. I will ruin you. I will erase your family from existence. Hey! Back in Punjab... ...when someone writes 70, 71, ...no one dares to erase that. You will erase my family... Bahattar. - Hey. Coward. Don't hit the wall. Hit me if you can. What have you done? - Thank God he didn't hit you! Call the jailor quickly. Yes. Bahattar. Come, sweetheart. Do you want to get married? - To you? You already put a barrier on my life. I meant that young man, that Azad. Yes I do, but... he's in jail. - Don't worry about that. I will get him out in a day or two. You? - I will have to. When children demand toys that don't last too long... ...but we've to get it for them. Come, I'll take you home. Come, Indu. Come. Come on. "When I saw you I was breathless." "I couldn't sleep all night." "I couldn't sleep all night." "When I saw you I was breathless." "I couldn't sleep all night." "I couldn't sleep all night." "You were like a fresh breath of air."

"I couldn't sleep all night." "I couldn't sleep all night." We've been attacked. Find out where they're attacking from. Go. Fast. - Sir. Who are you? What's my mistake? Will I wait for you to make one? Jailor. Here... here I am. Under the table. That's why the people say... ...the police always work under the table. No, no, no, no, no... Actually, when you fired... By the way, who are you? - Bahattar Singh. Punjab Police. I'm here to encounter a criminal. - Who? The one who slapped our minister. The minister's special counterr... ...has ordered me his encounter. But that's Azad. - Azad (free)? But the minister's office said he's still in jail. No, I meant his name is Azad. Yes. Joking with Punjab Police. No, no. Pulling our leg. It's okay. Go ahead. Call him. I will shoot him. Just a minute. As a police officer you must know... ...that taking a criminal out like this requires papers. Where's the paper? What was that? - Punjab Police's speed. Encounter paper. Not this paper. - But I only read Punjab Kesari. If you want Maharashtra Times... ...then go get it yourself. I mean the paper for Azad's encounter. Have you ever seen papers for illegal encounters? No. - What kind of a jailor are you? But... but... - I get it. I know people like you very well. People like you like to see their name and picture... ...published in the papers. That's fine. You can go ahead with the encounter. Your photo will be published. I don't mind. Bahattar Singh's photo is often published in the papers. The eencounterr should take place from theerer, not here. Are you sure? - Sure. Will you call me or should I? Shall I get a cup of tea for you as well? Hey. Go bring him. - Yes. I was saying... Don't spare him this time. Is there anyone else you want me to take care of? Everything fine? Okay? Yes, Jailor... you called. Bahattar, you... Don't mistake this for a toothbrush. It's not for cleaning your teeth. It can blow your brains out. Get out. Just come with me quietly. Open your mouth. Greedy dog. Okay, goodbye. - Okay. Just a minute. What happened? - Let him preach. Look... for all the sins you've committed... Repent for it from my heart. Right? Bye. Come on. Is that what you wanted to say? - Yes. Bahattar, come on. Otherwise he will bore me to death with his preachings. He's finally reformed. But, too late. What are you doing? Why are you shooting? Punjabi's never come or go quietly. Indu, I am free. I am free. Didn't I tell you? Bahattar. - Yes. Thank you. Indu, no need to say thank you. I could've freed everyone for your sake. Move back. Back. You freed me from jail. Come back later. I will make you rich. Rascal. I gave you the Taj Mahal... ...and you mistook yourself for Shah Jahan. What... - Bahattar. Forgive me if you can. Indu, don't apologise. It's destiny. And anyway, God blessed me with his grace... ...but maybe not with love. And I like a fool I was dancing with joy... ...in someone else's marriage. See you. You didn't tell me that you dance so well. You didn't tell me. When we met for the first time, you hurled the flowerpot at me. Second time you pointed the gun at me. After that you tried to scare me in the speeding car... - Fine. Let's go, Indu. You left no chance as well. You humiliated me at the disco. You go to the disco in a truck. In a truck. - Disco? And in a truck that has all the colours in the world. Don't insult the trucks. Trucks are the pride of Punjabis. Yeah, right. It's true. It's our way of living. To herll with him... Ho is that? Aren't you a police officer? No police officer is And anyway, my job's similar to police officers. I catch all the smuggling goods that... ...come from across the border and hand them over to the police. I do a good thing for the country... To herll with his... That means you're not a police officer. What difference does that make? You're not exactly marrying... ...the commissioner. - Hey. A criminal's sister will only marry another criminal, not the commissioner. Which criminal? - Her brother TT. Who else? Don't look at her like that. TT wanted a decent family. So he fooled you with his charade. Tell him. Smart-alec. Is that true? TT isn't a police offfficer. I asked is TT a police officer? Yeah, but you didn't say either... ...that you're not a police officer. What difference would that have made? Nothing. - So? Nothing. - Enough of your charade. Let's go. - Azad, what's this? You can see that I am talking. You don't have any manners. You will teach me manners... Indu... he was trying to hit me, so... You did the right thing. Come on, let's go home. Home? Yes. Home. I've realised that I was demanding... ...for a useless, good-for-nothing thing. Come on. Wait, I will show you. Jeevan, after ordering the flowers... ...give a reminder to the music band. Tomorrow at the marriage I don't... You lied that Bahattar is a police officer. You lied to me as well... that TT is a police officer. Sir, this is not my fault. It's all because of my father. He said that where marriages are concerned... ...fibbing is allowed. He was right. And before anyone finds out about your lie. ...I want you to bury it deep in the ground... ...and get us married. Because, now if anyone finds out before the marriage... ...then you are done for. That means you two know everything... ...and you two are still ready. Ready. - Ever ready. The proceession ill be here any minute... Hello. Hello. Who are you? Why don't you say something? You've made my life hell. You've all the time in the world, but I don't. Stupid, fool, idiot. Every day... What do you get by hearing your son curse you every day? Satisfaction, Jigna. That he's alright. He's even working now. He was working with you as well. - Yes. He was making mistakes, but... ...you didn't have to throw him out of the house for that. Jigna. One has to heat the iron in fire first... ...before moulding it into something useful. You think I am happy about... ...throwing my son out of the house. In future when he's successful... ...l'll be the happiest person on earth. Am I right? I am his father after all. Father, I look like Aladdin. Of course, brother. Father. You're crying. Father, I am not leaving. I am bringing your daughter-in-law home. - Yes, son None of our ancestors... ...saw their sons or grandsons getting married with pride. They'd eitheer marry therm in the streets... ...or elope with the girls in taxis. Bahattar, for the first time... ...we'll be associated with such a honourable family. And for the first time... ...our family will get a local daughter-in-law. Just keep laughing, father. Keep laughing. Sir. Don't worry. Just look at how happy Indu is. I think this time she will certainly get married. Yes, Baktawar. Education to women, paves the path to progress. You're right, boss... Come quickly. Look. You will soon be a part of this sensational news. No one should know that you're from press. If anyone asks, say you're the videographer. Where is Bhagat? - Bhagat's downstairs. I'll explain him everything while you turn on the camera. Switch on the camera, quickly. Bhagat. Oh, it's you. - Yes, it's me. I've made all the arrangements for a live-telecast. Now the entire world will watch TT's charade. Very good. The real fun starts now. I've called Raghav. Raghav? Why did you call him? I will handle the camera. "I will handle the camera." If you stand up everyone will find out. Just stay seated, I will handle everything. Listen. Listen to me... Just stay seated, I will handle everything. Look... Mili. Mili. Mili. Mansukh, that horse... Mansukh. Mansukh. Jeevan. - Yes. I still can't believe that I fixed this marriage. Yeah, but count your chickens only when they hatch. What? - I mean this marriage... ...is between two explosive personalities. One's a bomb and the other's an atom bomb. Just pray that none of them explodes... Get out. - You don't want me to attend the marriage. Go get ready and come back with a gift. Today we'll show you... the Don's hospitality. Look, at one side you've fritters being fried... ...and vegetables are being brutally chopped on the other side. Weird looking chefs have been called... ...on his sisterr's marriage.

Hey you! You think I am a fool. I've got a rash on my back sitting on that chair. And you two want to take all the credit. Why you... Bhagat, you've gone crazy... I'll show you what I can do. Give that here. Let go. - Where are you taking the camera? Bhagat... The groo wil alk ahead frorm the fourth round. Now me in the front? - Yes. Bhagat... - stop. Let's start the marriage from the beginning, I want to shoot it. You... you're absolutely fine. We've a problem. Wasn't he crippled? - He sure was. Miracle! Miracle! Miracle! Hold this. You make the video. It's a miracle! My brother was paralysed because... ...he had an accident with TT's car. And today, he's been cured... ...and dancing with glee to see him happy. Dancing with glee. - Dancing. He started dancing with glee. He started dancing with glee, in TT's house. He started dancing with glee. Forget all this. Continue with your nuptial rounds. Shut up! I beg you, forgive me. Actually we both brother and sister are press reporters. Our job was in danger so we put up this charade. Forget all this. Continue with your nuptial rounds. Please forgive Mili and Bhagat. Please forgive us. Forgive us. - Baktawar! Take theem away. Brother! Brother! - Come on. Forgive us. - Come on. Mili. Leave us, Baktawar. Come on. Get going. Get lost. - Come on. Get lost from here, come on. - Oh TT. What are press reporters doing in your house? It happens. These things happen with influential people. The press reporters get a story. People do anything to make a living. They even lie. Forget all this. Continue with your nuptial rounds. Four. TT, now I wil teach you a lesson. You locked me up. Where was I locked up? Five. Five nuptial rounds have been completed. Six. That's six. Last one. Stop! I won't spare anyone. I will arrest everyone. I will throw everyone behind bars. TT! Enjoying the marriage, are you? What did you lock me in the room for? Honeymoon? I couldn't go to the bathroom... He locked me in a place, I had to search for a corner. He locked me in the dungeon. Darkness all around. Walls everywhere. Any direction I turned... ...I bumped into a wall. Mumbai Police, calm down. Your friend here seems angry. Calm him down. He's no friend of mine... - Baktawar. Azad boss, why don't you barge as well citing "Stop". Boss. You spent so long in jail... ...that you must hate the word "Stop". Hey! - Sorry, boss. I'll wait here... while they take their rounds. I see. Stop! Sattar! Ekhattar! Bahattar! Stop this marriage. Where did this rascal come from? Who are you? - Inspector Jugnu Singh. Punjab Police. - I see. Your relative. No, no... - No. I am not their relative. You're going to be the relative of these scoundrels! Leave me! Leave me! Get lost. No one's ready to form any kind of relation with them. Do you know why? Because it's been their tradition... ...to do all the wrong deeds in the world. But he's a police officer. Police officer? Him? Police officers don't look like him, they look like this. Tell me, does anyone appoint a 10th standard drop out. Hey, what is he saying? He's lying. I am not a I am 12th standard drop out. But you said that you're police officers. Brother, he's fake. He's lying. - That's a lie! You all lied to me. You lied to me for your son's marriage. Aren't you ashamed? You should all die of shame. TT sir, calm down. Calm down. Take a peek in yourself beforer blaing others. You call yourself police officers. I know everything. Mansukh has told me everything. You are not police officer either, you're a criminal. A criminal. Baldy, do you want to choke me? I tried to tell you that he's a criminal. But no one listened to me. Everyone believed his white lies. Tendulkar, now you will have to deal with Kambli. You committed such big crimes... ...but you also tell such cheap, petty lies. And while wearing the Mumbai Police uniform. Why? I was helpless. Because I... couldn't find a decent family for my sister. And anyway, I didn't lie. Mansukh asked me to lie so I did. TT boss. Azad has abducted the priest. And Indu as well. Gentlemen, why did you abduct me? The marriage wasn't complete yet. Priest, you've to conduct Azad boss's marriage now. Stay quiet! Azad, let me go. Or you will regret it. Nonsense. What can Bahattar do to me? What can he possibly do? Do I need to tell you? Try to rermerber. You will understand. Azad speaking. Send 200 more men. Right now. Indu. Our marriage venue has arrived. How did he arrive before us? When did he overtake us? I didn't see. There are three things that exist in this word... ...but you can't see it. Ghosts. True love. And... his... speed. "The player." "He's the player, buddy." Remember what I had said? I will load you with riches. But I didn't say I will give you mine fortune. Hey! She's my wife. - What wife? I know how to count. You still have one round left. - That's why you're still breathing. Let Indu go. - Indu. Why you... No. Why will I lock horns with you? My men can deal with you. Ronnie! Chhagan, Chintu. Ravi, Raghu, Madhu, Aktar. Aazad Come on, the marriage dais is waiting for us. We've to get married. - Aazad. Let's go quickly, or he'll come and ruin everything. Come on. The dias is not decorated, but we'll have to get arried. Brother. Bahattar! "The sky's thundering." "The earth's shaking." "For this scratch." "You'll have to pay with your blood." "It's true."
