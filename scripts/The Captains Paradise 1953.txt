A WOMAN OF RARE QUALITIES. A MATE TO SATISFY ALL THE HOME-LOVING ELEMENTS IN ME. [ Henry ] INDUSTRIOUS, DOMESTICATED. BUSY WITH THE HUNDRED AND ONE ACTIVITIES OF THE DAILY ROUND. A WOMAN WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE CENTERED ON THE JOYS OF HEARTH AND HOME. IN THE WORDS OF THE POET-- "SOBER, STEADFAST AND DEMURE." BUT IT IS ABSURD TO IMAGINE THAT THE SAME WOMAN WHO COMES HOME WITH THE GROCERIES... CAN ALSO COME HOME WITH THE MILK. SO IN KALIK-- MADAME ST. JAMES. A CHILD OF NATURE, THE EPITOME OF THE JUNGLE, THE MATE THAT THE TIGER IN ME, IN EVERY MAN, IS SEEKING. PLEASURE-LOVING, CAREFREE, DELIGHTING IN THE ADORNMENT OF HER BODY, OCCUPIED IN MAKING HER ATTRACTIONS EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE. THE FEMALE OF THE SPECIES. GRACEFUL AS A PANTHER, LIGHT OF FOOT AS A GAZELLE. A HAPPY WOMAN, AND WHY ? BECAUSE ALL HER THOUGHTS ARE, AS THE POET SAYS, "A WONDER AND A WILD DESIRE, THE DEVOTED PRIESTESS OF LOVE, LIFE AND LAUGHTER." THAT, RICCO, IS MY SOLUTION FOR MAN'S HAPPINESS ON EARTH. TWO HAPPY WOMEN, EACH IN THEIR WAY PERFECT, AND IN BETWEEN, THE COMPANY OF MEN, THE CLASH OF INTELLECTS TO STIMULATE THE MIND. CAPTAIN, A GENIUS. THANK YOU, RICCO. I'LL TELL EVERYBODY. YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING. BUT ALL MEN SHOULD KNOW OF THIS WONDERFUL DISCOVERY. SOONER OR LATER. BUT UNTIL YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION, OR UNTIL I'M NO LONGER WITH YOU, YOU'LL TELL NO ONE.
