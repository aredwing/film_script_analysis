Didn't I ask you not to go on that side? I'm tired of explaining this to Birbal. But he doesn't listen. You wicked, you've started talking a lot. It's not safe to go there. Come.. come. Birbal, you are here! Birbal, do you just have to wander here.. .. and there or learn something in life as well? Whatever I say you hear with this ear.. .. and let go with the other. In this way you won't even get admission in any school. Grandpa, look what Birbal has found Grandpa, is it dead; won't it ever fly again? Perhaps it's journey ended here. - Journey means? Means it's purpose must have got solved. What is purpose, grandpa? - Purpose? Whatever we have to do in life; consider it your purpose. Without a purpose life has no identity. Grandpa, what is my purpose? One has to decide one's own purpose, Tahaan. Eating everything! - Hey Tahaan, come here! Do you teach this to your Birbal? Look he nibbled my clothes. Take these sheep to the mountains. Then you'll come to know, Zoya! - Come to know what? That how difficult is the job of us men. - You and man? Do one thing; go and call mother. Shouldn't I take Birbal? - Leave him at least sometime! Go; say grandpa has come, go! Come, Birbal come. All the time Birbal.. all the time Birbal! You want to become Birbal when you grow up!? You could never catch me, Zoya! Son of Birbal! You know Birbal, mother was crying even today. Look mother has come; now you'll get scolded. Mother, you know I went to look for Birbal.. .. then I heard tanks fire from the mountain side. And then Birbal spotted a dead bird. I didn't bring him; he came after me himself. And then I went home and grandpa went to police station. Tahaan, Zoya, look carefully and say.. .. what all do you see here? Nothing. - You shut up; you don't know anything. I'll say. I see colourful threads. That depends on the style of the onlooker. Father weaved this with his hands, grandpa? - Yes. Let father come then I'll tell him to.. .. make a picture of Birbal also in this. Donkey in carpet; have you gone mad or what? Grandpa, Birbal is absolutely ready to go to work. We both.. -Tahaan, you are just a kid; immature by brain. Grandpa, don't pay attention to her words. This matter is between us men. Birbal, I've convinced grandpa. We'll start working tomorrow. Now you don't make any mess. So what if I fell asleep; you could have woken me? Is this donkey yours? He is very cute. His name is Birbal. When my father brought him from Sirhom.. .. he was this small. You aren't coming to school; going to work? Tahaan walks like a donkey. - come on, move! Tahaan walks like a donkey.. Tahaan walks like a donkey. Come on, move! - Tahaan walks like a donkey. Tahaan walks like a donkey. Tahaan, look your donkey is running away. Birbal. Hello? What? 1 0 rupees per kilo? Sir, even if apples rot; they won't sell at the price of potatoes. Okay discount for you. Fifty.. fifty; but only this time Uncle Yakub, only interest is getting deposited in your.. .. account; have you thought something about the capital? I have kept the accounts clear, sir; nothing to worry. And your son Yusuf; who'll repay his loan? Well, we pay the interest on time, sir. I'm worried about the capital. It's 5 years since your son went missing. What are you saying, sir; it's not.. .. even 3 years that Yusuf went away. But.. but your money won't go anywhere. I am the head of the family. I promise. Grandpa, Birbal and I have come. Come on, don't we've to go to work? Who advised you to come here? Go home immediately. But last night..? Hello? - Go.. go. What's the matter, young man; you look lost? Come on, let's hear a story. About a little girl. Very innocent; exactly like Zoya. Her parents used to toil in the sun whole day. And only then they could arrange meals twice a day. On the other hand whole day that small girl.. .. used to move here and there in the house. Absolutely upset. One day.. it rained heavily! And the roof of that old tattered house.. .. was leaking from many places. Water kept dropping inside from there. For long she kept watching this with petrified eyes. Then for sometime.. she fell asleep. Then, her house got drowned in water? All the clouds disappeared somewhere. Bright sun came out. Through that hole light was coming in. And fell on a dead butterfly on her shirt. Slowly that butterfly became alive. What! Became truly alive? - Became alive! And then it came out of her shirt and started flying.. .. here and there.. here and there in the whole house. The girl's happiness knew no bounds. - Then? Then that light kissed the face of that small girl. That's it! Since then her life got changed. She understood that life is not for being upset. It is like a pleasant dream. It has to be lived to the full! Say what? - Could such light touch me also? Yes, my child yes. Birbal.. -Tahaan, why don't you teach him properly? I wonder who is teaching whom? You're teaching the donkey or the donkey is teaching you. 'It's not the question of only your husband. ' '8 thousand men are missing here. ' 'Now even no hope is left any more ' 'We don't even know if he's alive or not. ' 'Shall I consider myself a widow? 'Oh Allah, to die is better than this. ' Mother, where are you taking all this? Why are you taking of this carpet? Birbala? Birbala? 'Everyone is gone; even Birbal is not here!' Mother, wait! Mother, wait! Mother, where is Birbal!? Mother, wait! Wait! Tahaan, wait! Where are you running!? Hey wait. Don't run! I'm getting late! Why.. why you beat him!? Why!? Why you beat him!? Why!? This donkey kicked me twice Leave.. Leave Leave.. Leave him! Leave.. Leave! - This donkey is not yours any more This belongs to Lalaji. Go from here! If you listen to me then your problems will end forever. If you listen to me then your problems will end forever. This is your solution. If you sell this house to us.. .. then this loan will get repaid. And then you just relax. That is all right. But I can't ruin my business.. .. waiting for some missing person. Look, I kept this proposal considering your feelings. The rest is up to you. But, mother Biral..? Hello!? Hello!? Hello, I am Moli speaking. I've sent a money order of rupees 5000, receive it. There is no letter for you. If it comes I'll send. Well, policemen were looking for you. You didn't get informed? Then go. Mother, but what about Birbal? Your husband is missing? Boy, go home. 'Curfew is imposed in the whole region. ' 'This morning militants tried to trespass near Karnal sector. ' 'BSF restricted them. ' '6 militants got killed in the firing and 3 wounded. ' Anyone among them? Hey boy, come here. Don't you know curfew is imposed here? Family will be worried; go home. Come on.. come on. Tahaan? Tahaan? Tahaan, you went to Lalaji's place last night? Not that, I was.. - Mother, he was out for long. I saw him sneaking into house very late at night. Birbal! What a surprise! It seems he followed me. Mother, you know they beat him so much.. .. beat him so much that I couldn't tolerate. So I just went and cut his rope. And did you think what they'll think about you? They'll call you a thief. Take him back to them? Hey you thief! You stole the donkey! - Leave.. Leave me. Sir, this child stole the donkey. - Stole? No, he doesn't steal. It's matter of only 2 days, Mr. Mirza. I've ordered for a new truck. Then all the deliveries will be before time You just keep the payment ready. Sir, this child stole the donkey. -Thank you. So, kid; is this true? If I had stolen him.. then would I come to return him? Sir, give me some work. Instead of money give me this donkey. Come on, go. - Sir, believe me; Birbal and I can do a lot. Hey go! There's no work here for you, go! But I'll come back for sure to take back my Birbal. Today you've no escape. Come to mother! Mother, look at him; he took all the money from the box! Could I do so? Zoya is in a habit of joking How could Birbal and I live separately? I will have to bring him home. Money? -This is interest money. This is not interest money; this is for my Birbal! This isn't enough even for one day's fodder. .. for that useless. - He is not useless! Now say where is my Birbal? - We sold him. What; sold him!? - Yes, that old man took him. By now he might have reached the mountain. Mountain? - Yes. Hey kid salesman, where are you rushing to? That useless old man sold Birbal! - Useless old man? If you think that when time comes.. .. one has to bow down even to a donkey. Then you are mistaken. I'm not going to do so! But I also know that where words fail kicks work. You've stopped 1 0 times within 10 feet distance. Four.. four.. four.. four.. - Uncle, throw the ball. Uncle is your father! I am Suhan Dar. Ball? Here it goes. - Sixer! Mr. Dar. - What you said? Mr. Dar. - Now who the hell are you? I am not who the hell. I am Tahaan. Mr. Tahaan, what you want? I can make him move. - He can make him move. How? Why covering this ear? Donkey listens with one ear and let's out with the other. For the first time I see a donkey influenced with bribe. What false promise you whispered in his ears? Nothing. Look, Mr. Dar he can do a lot of work. He just needs a guide; and I'm there for that. I'll make him move even faster than ponies. - Is it? Your donkey will go ahead of ponies? If it doesn't happen so, then you don't pay anything. One minute. When did I say that I will take you along? No.. no.. - Hey! Don't go closer to him. Nature has given two eyes to donkeys at such.. .. a place so that they could see all the four of their legs. So they know when to kick. - Is it, my hidden talent? Uncle Dar. Hey uncle. - Yes? Give this letter to her. - Love letter. This envelope is scented. Scent of love. Children, what is this? - Love letter! Love letter. - Come on, uncle you are just.. You are just. Hey! Look what he did. - He eats letters also? Ladies hair pin! Come on, do your work. Yes, say. - Sir, when will we reach home? Hey, it's a very long journey. .. it will be night by the time we return. Did you tell your family or not? - No. Then tell your family. Tell his family Tell his father, tell his mother, tell the whole village. Come on, go from here! But you wait for me. I'll come shortly. Hey! I'll wait for you. I'll wait for something to happen. I'm just waiting for so many years. Come on.. come on! Tahaan? Sir, where is Zoya now? Oh my god! A small Kashmiri boy! How sweet! You watch, she and junior sir will make a nice couple. Look here, child; I'll click your photo. - Smile, child. Tahaan. Tahaan, what are you doing here? And if anybody wants to click your photo will you just grin? I.. I just came to tell you that I am going. And she came in between. - So then go! Yes.. yes; I'll return by evening. But, Tahaan where are you going? - Evening.. evening! Tahaan? Tahaan? Hey brother militant, did you see Mr. Suhan Dar? Did you see Mr. Suhan Dar? Did you see Mr. Suhan Dar? Did you see Mr. Suhan Dar? Did you see Mr. Suhan Dar? - He went this way. Mr. Dar! Mr. Dar! - Oh my god; he came back.. .. again like a useless coin. - But I told my family. You only told me to inform the family. Come here. Go back home or I'll beat you. Please take me with you. Birbal will work more if I'm there. Oh! So you've named him as Birbal? Akbar's minister! What a person he was and what kind of ministers we have now! What? Nothing. What title you have for your mule? Tahaan! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! What's wrong with network? Hello! - Please listen. If you didn't want to talk, why you called my number? Hello! - Mr. Dar! Yes. Who? It's not Zafar's phone. Why would I give my phone to Zafar. Why would l? Who is Zafar? My father. Mr. Dar.. What? C'mon, Birbal. Come. C'mon, Birbal. Hey! Hey! Uncle Suhan! Uncle Suhan! Uncle Suhan! Oh, uncle, it's me, Zafar. Oh! Good that you told me. Otherwise I'd think emperor Shahjahan.. .. has come with his Mumtaj Mahal. Uncle, you left so early today? I've not left early, you are late. I know the reason very well. Uncle, you had assured her aunt that you'll take her with you. Greetings! - Greetings! But I'd not permitted you to give my mobile number to everybody. Uncle, please don't get upset. Nowadays the incoming calls are free. And they have come out with a very good new plan. I know incoming is free. But this phone is mine. Not your father's. My father. - Shut up! Tell her that we have names also.. .. for the donkeys and mules here. What name her aunt has for her? Nadira. You shut up! What is your name? - Nadira. - Huh! Nadira! Where has he come from? He fell from the sky but instead of falling on date tree. .. he fell on my shoulders. Mister, now the boss has come. You may go home. C'mon. Let's go. Go! Hey, why are you staring? Leave the donkey and get lost. Get lost! C'mon. Hey! C'mon. Come. C'mon. Come. C'mon. Come. C'mon. Come. Come nicely! "There is disco dance in your heart. " "Disco dance!" "There is disco dance in your heart. " "Disco dance!" This idiot is still following us. Hey! Get lost. Go. Oh! What's this? Why are you carrying the bag? We have a donkey. Give me. C'mon. It seems that donkey is missing that boy. Find him out. There's no need. It will be like asking for trouble. This donkey will deal with this donkey. C'mon. Fast. Where has he gone? He was here just now. Hey! Why you were struggling with the mountains? They look after us. There is a method to climb and get down from it. Your Birbal didn't tell you this? Give me. C'mon, drink this. And you'll get well soon. What are you looking at? I've to handle all these troubles How was it? c'mon, smile. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. What is mightier? Brains or brawn? Hey! What is mightier? Brains or brawn? Brawn. Who all are there in your home? I'm all alone in this world. O' donkey, she didn't ask you. My aunt and my elder sister Jaya. How much time you needed for buying all these donkeys? How much time we must have taken, Zafar? Idiot! Around 4 years, dear. years? - Yes. Do you know why this place is so empty? They all ran away. Stop nonsense. These are the homes of Kashmiri Pandit. Quiet and deserted. All had to leave. Friend! Come. Laska? You know, TV reporters we here. I saw. I was here. Laska. Once again you are hiding as always. Zafar! Keep it here. Hey! Who is this Laska? You'll know it soon. He'll tell you soon. An old friend. Who turned away from the world of fear. Who was deserted by his own. And so now he neither wants to talk to anybody.. .. nor would he talk. Laska uncle! Panditji! He lives with the memories. With a hope that perhaps the past days will be back. Doesn't anybody stay here? But if he is fearful, why does he stay here alone? He thinks it is better to stay in his own home.. .. in this quiet place than staying in refugee camps. Zafar, you'll understand it faster if you keep your mouth shut. Uncle, I was going to tell this same to Nadira. But by the time you said it. Mr. Suhan, who all stay in your home? He has only a nephew. All others were killed. Come. What are you doing? C'mon. Hurry up. C'mon. c'mon. Get in. C'mon. Go quickly. C'mon. Come on. Shabir! You've come? Am I late? Shabir, he is uncle Suhan. He brought me here safely. I'm zafar. - Greetings! Greetings! May God bless you. Thank you, uncle. Bye. Bye. Bye. Hurry up, Nadira. It's the time of our wedding. Mr. Zafar, it's the time of her wedding. You heard her? It's her wedding time. Hey! Keep the goods quickly. Keep the goods quickly. Today the goods won't reach on time.. Because of these lazy people. What have I done? We're late because of this donkey. No! I was ahead of your mules. Oh! So you are challenging for race? Race? - Race. There is only one way to go sooner. Look, both of you will run a race. What will we get? What you'll get? 1 0-15 rupees more. What else? And I'll get my Birbal. No. you'll get Rs. 10. that's all. But I want my Birbal. All right. You'll get it. Let's go. Uncle! I'll win. So l want the mobile phone. It is cheaper than the donkey. Mobile? Small one or bigger which opens up? C'mon. Run the race. Let's go. The race is not easy. But we'll have to win. Otherwise how I'll be able to take you back home? Hey, get lost. My mobile is guaranteed. Birbal! Oh! We'll reach uncle Suhan's house soon. Then the race gets over. You'll just look on. Birbal, if you want to come home with me.. .. then you must come with me quickly. C'mon. Hey! I'm ahead. Nadira! Nadira! Nadira! Oh! Good! How is my child? Had you gone to work today? - Yes. You served tea to people? - Yes. Have you made any friends? No. Oh! Now go out. Wait for a while. You'll find your new friend soon. Who is he? Go and wait for him. Who is it? It is not a simple race. A mule is racing with donkey. Let me see. Baba, you had said there is a donkey and a mule. But only a boy can be seen. Yes, I had said it, but.. Donkey! Huh! Zafar! Idiot! Hey, c'mon. - Baba! Don't worry. Don't worry. He will be pleased with you only if you touch him with love. Now Zafar will get a kick from me. But dear Yasin, this donkey is not a common donkey. This has stood first in the race. How could the idiot reach? The donkey was lucky. Nothing else. You know who gets the credit for this victory? Who? Tahaan. From today this lovely friend is yours. Mine? - Yes. This is wrong. You had said that you'd give me the donkey when I win. Had I said that I'll give you the donkey? You are talking as if this was your donkey.. .. and I forcibly took it. You won just a race and you want the donkey? Huh! If this useless Zafar had not got involved.. .. with a girl on the way, could your donkey.. .. have reached here before the mule? No. but you had said that if I win you'd give me my Birbal. Oh stupid, I'd said it to encourage you. Or would you and this lazy Zafar have reached here on time? But I reached here before time. So what do you think, had Zafar reached here on time.. .. would have I given him this mobile phone? Somebody come and talk to him. Explain it to him. Get lost. Go. You told lies. You are a liar. Yes, I'm a liar, so? Uncle.. You've taken his donkey from him? What? What are you looking at? Go and see if he goes home safely or not. Go! Hey! Where are you running, idiot! Huh! Hey! I was almost dead running after you. And then there's such ice fall! You didn't take your Rs. 10. the old man won't give later. You should have taken it now. I don't want money. I want my Birbal. Your brain has become like that of a donkey.. .. while running after the donkey. You know how much a donkey costs? You'll have to make 1000 such rounds. Only then perhaps you'll be able to buy one. Yes. You do this. take this Take it. Look, we don't even have a donkey in our fate. Take it. Take it. I want Birbal. Hey! Where are you running to? Hey, Tahaan! Why are you crying? I'm your friend. Idris. Won't you tell your friend? I lost everything. What do you mean you lost everything? Birbal. I'd gone to bring him back. Birbal.. who Birbal? Birbal. My donkey. He is like my bother. Lalaji took away everything. What if you get back your Birbal? How will you bring him? By stealing? No. why should I steal? I'll ask Baba. Baba! Baba who? He is one who has solution to every problem. So let's go to him. Not now. We'll go tomorrow. Where will you meet me tomorrow? Perhaps tomorrow I'll come to your home. My home? Look, don't tell anybody about our friendship. I'll go. Remember it. Don't tell anybody. Idris! Idris! Baba can really get back my Birbal? He surely can. Is he any magician? He knows magic? No. Will I have to work for him? No. Will he give me money? No. Then why would he do this for me? He does this for everybody. But he'll ask a question to you. A question? To me? What question? Like, who owns these mountains, valley and this jungle Is that so? Who do they belong to? It is your job to find this out. Brother ldris, I'll come back. But this girl came with her parents. She looked very eager to talk to junior boss. She has brought the sweets from Mumbai. I saw your junior boss. He had put on such a fine dress. Shut up! Why is he my junior boss? You do this, you eat all this sweet. Aunt, all these mountains and the jungle.. Who do they belong to? Forget all that. She was not looking so bad. But there was too much make-up on the face And the shoes had high heels. I don't think junior boss will marry her. Aunt, tell me who do these mountain.. Aunt, tell me, who do these mountain belong to? Get up! All of you come out. How many people are there in your home? Tahaan! Tahaan! What is inside this? Nothing. Just rice. What is your name? - Tahaan. What is your age? Tahaan means kind hearted. Listen! Listen! Every male member is requested that.. .. to gather at the school building. Listen! Listen! Every male member is requested that.. .. to gather at the school building. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! What are they going to do? All of you stand up in queue. In a queue! C'mon. C'mon. Get up. Move back. C'mon, go. Oh, why have you come here? Just now you announced that all males should come here. So I came here. OK It doesn't matter. Now go home. Yes. We found one. We are bringing him. Over. We'll soon be there. Idris! Idris! What? Are you afraid? I'm not afraid of anybody. Not even the army people. Really? They had come to our home yesterday. With big guns. Aunt was afraid. But I wasn't afraid. Not a gun. With guns. Do you know how many types of guns are there? Made in China. Made in Russia. Made in America. Rocket launcher! Grenade! Here. Made in Kashmir. When these big guns are shot then you can see smoke everywhere. Your ears will explode listening to their sound. I saw it when a rocket fell on my home. Since then I can hear sounds in my ears. Even in my sleep. Didn't you get hurt? I was hurt. But Baba came on time and saved my life. Your Baba is a nice man. Isn't he? He can bring back your Birbal. C'mon. Let's go to Baba. Do your family members know that you've come with me? No. Good. Don't tell anybody about me. How many times will you repeat it? You know what Baba says about these mountains and valleys? What does your Baba say about them? At some time all this was sold. Including us everything was sold cheaply. Can you seethe blue sky up there? Yes. Even that doesn't belong to us now. We are paying up the interest, but the loan doesn't get repaid. Baba says we must change all this. "We shall change all this.. " Were you going to pass through the forest? There is no need to worry. Hey! Why are you blindfolding me? It is necessary. Otherwise it will be difficult for me.. .. to take you to Baba. Have we come to meet the militants? Do you want Birbal or not? I want it. Tie it! - OK Let us go. Is this the correct path? Do you trust me or not? I have played blind man's bluff with Shireen also! My foot is stuck into dung! I would have slipped and fallen! No, it's just mud! Do not tell lies! I can smell the stink! Anyway, you are not going to fall. But I can see nothing! Nothing at all! Are you breeding a lot of ducks? May I fire it? It's not a task for children, but a man can fire it. Nothing happened. Baba is calling you. Come quickly. Tahaan, let us go in. I had never thought that a gun can be so heavy. Brother ldris, do you also have a gun? Stop talking nonsense! Do you want to meet Baba? Brother ldris, Baba.. Did you like meeting Baba? Yes. And he said that I will find Birbal. But didn't he ask the question? - He asked But I said that I too asked the same question to everybody! To whom do these mountains and forests belong? But my mother and sister Zoya didn't answer me! What else did Baba say? He too didn't answer me. Instead, he said that I should go to school everyday. And I should play. Did he say anything about me? Yes, he did. That you will give me something.. .. to deliver at some place. Yes; in your next trip, I will give you a packet. Are you hiding something? This is a task for me. Careful! Careful! May I see it? - No, no. Baba may get angry. But what will you do with it? I.. hold it. What does it do? I will tell you everything when the time comes. Will these shoes fit you? These days, your mind is becoming like that of Birbal! I don't know. Oh no. Tahan, again you disappeared! Do you know, yesterday junior master had a fight.. .. with his mother and father. He is not ready to marry that girl. Tahaan! Are you listening to me? Zoya, I have to go in the early morning. - Where? This time I am going to tell mother. You are doing this everyday! Mother! Mother! Hadn't I told you? Again he is going there! Don't you know? Father went there once.. .. and we are still waiting for him! I am doing all this for the sake of Birbal. Everyone has forgotten what father had said! He had said that Tahaan will never be lonely.. .. if Birbal is with him. May I go now? Mother, what's this? 'Mother, please listen to me!' Suicide bombers were found in Baramullah. Tahaan! You turned out to be very brave! Are you ready for the 2ndjourney? Who tied this? Yaseen, uncle Suhan's nephew. All day he was adorning him. He told me not to put too much load on him. And uncle Suhan agreed. Well, I would have been better off.. hey! If I had been born as a donkey! Uncle Suban.. Do not worry. He has said that if you want to earn money.. .. by working hard, you can do so. Hey! Brother Jafar who is the owner of these mountains? Huh! Uncle, did you see? The idiot is thinking of buying the mountains! Tahaan, these mountains and forests do not belong to anyone. In fact, we belong to them. While we live, we think that we have bought them. But after death, we become one with them. These mountains have lived since centuries.. .. and they will live on. Dar sir, is the purpose of life served after that? Who taught you this? My father used to say that it is necessary to have a goal in life. Dear, your father was right. For me, life is a story. A short story of a long journey And it's necessary to have a purpose in every story. Jafar, what's your purpose? Forget it. Shall we go? Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Hey, look there! I saw Lasra! Why would Lasra come in front of an idiot like him? Uncle, are you feeding an apple? You never gave me! This time I got very good apples. Pandit! Birbal! Where did it go? Look! Look, what your donkey has done to the steps! Where did he go? Hey, idiot, eat this! Look! Hey, donkey! Hey, donkey! Oh, so you are here! What do you think? That you will fool me by running away? Jafar Khan knows everything! He knows everything! Jafar Khan will catch you from wherever you go, ok? Do you want to eat an apple? Eat! Eat! Eat! Move! Move! Come! -Where had you gone? Yes, we will see. War has benefited only the governments. Whether it is of this place or that of across the border! What does it mean? It means that your husband will sit with you, walk with you.. .. dance with you! All of us know how a father carrying his dead son's coffin feels! These mountains, these forests.. .. these rivers are witness to it. Our children are our future! I wish their life improves! Yaseen is my only heir. All that I have will belong to him.. .. everything else is nonsense! Hadn't I told you I will not give it to you? It's inside. Now what do I do with this? Keep it with you. I will meet you later. Till then, take care of this and yourself. Watch over it. Keep it hidden. But will I get back Birbal? I have promised you! You will get it. Dar sir! - Yes? Hurry up. - Why? Are you missing the deadline for your marriage? Over and out. Greetings. -Where are you going? - Rajpura. What is your name? - Suhan Dar. What all are you taking this time? Sir, the same apples, bag of rice, spices.. .. and a lover's letter for his beloved. Carry on. Let him pass. Open it. Open it. Hey, boy, what's your name? Tahaan. What is your name? - ldris. Come on. Tahaan! Tahaan! Do you know him? I know uncle ldris. Greetings. - Greetings. This is my uncle, Salim. Are you going up to Darpna? Yes. And you? - We too. So shall we travel together? Yes. Shall we go? OK, let us go. Come. You are very quiet! Is everything all right? Uncle's relative died. Oh! What happened? - He was old. Oh! Well it was a good thing. What do you mean? No, I mean nowadays, more people die at young age, isn't it? That's why. Stop. We will be going this way so good bye. And I feel sorry for your loss. Let us go. Let us go! Come on! Father! Hold this. Counting at half-rate, here are your wages for two days. This is not your job, now go home. What time shall I come tomorrow? There is no need to come tomorrow. You should be in school during daytime. Get going! Come with me! Come with me. Grandpa sleeps here. There's no one in this room. It is always vacant. Don't know why father doesn't like it. Tahaan, look at this! I have made all this! Look at this! This is grandpa's mule, Shera. And this is grandpa. This is father, and mother. Tell me who is this? Birbal. This is me, and who is this? Who? This is you. Tahaan. Why don't you buy another donkey for yourself? Another one! Why? Does Birbal belong to you? My father had given it to me. Where are your mother and farther? My parents are dead. That is why all the rooms are empty. Grandpa, get me another donkey. Why? What's wrong with this one? It is bigger than me! But you are also growing up! Tell me frankly why you don't want Birbal. Because, because Birbal belongs to Tahaan. How do you know? His father gave Birbal to him. He himself told me this. So what do you want from me? Grandpa, please return Birbal to him. What about the money l have spent on Birbal.. .. if I return it to him? Grandpa, you only had told me that our happiness lies.. .. in making others happy! I had said so but.. right. Right. Give it!

Is it hot? Yes; take it. Will you drink tea? It's free. I will just be back. Hey! One more job is pending. - Do you mean I won't get back Birbal? No, do this job and then you will get Birbal. What? Should I throw it? - Yes. After taking off the pin, keep the lever pressed.. .. or else it will explode! Will it explode if I let it go? If you release the lever even by mistake, throw it immediately! Tahaan, are you still wandering here? I will come after finishing my work. Hey! Hey! You will get hurt! What were you doing with them? Birbal! Yaseen! Hey, Tahaan, where had you gone? I waited so long for you! Birbal, if needed, I will make Grandpa says that miracles do happen! Look, it is happening! Father! Father!
