There is mail for you. Should I bring it? You have been gone for 5 days. Dont you want to live together anymore? Because I go out late, I dont want to move yet. Stop whining. Did you come here to drink something, we havent talked in a while. Have you got any money? - Yes, Ill buy. Where are we going? Give up, Ill play again. You know that girl? - Sure. A first class whore. I believe that immediately. Cant you introduce me to her? Nadine, phone for you. Its Francis. Dont stand there like that, Ill lose my concentration. Will you be late tonight? - I dont know. Stop whining. Theres nobody here. Its a week now. Its ok. Manu... Manu, come please. Where is Radouan? Where is Radouan? - Come here. Are you watching that junk again? I thought you wouldnt come to eat. - Shut down that tv. You are totally insane. If you were a guy... Go to the kitchen. I want to finger myself here. I have had enough of doing it in my room. Where are the papers? - In the basket. Do you smoke nowadays? - No, its for you. A gift from King Radouan. Do you deal like your brother, fucking Radouan? - Relax. I am relaxed. But the whole neighbourhood is talking about it. You are so scared that the cops will arest you. Hes not the type to jump at everything. Something happened between us. I shouldnt have done it immediately the first night. I dont understand why he doesnt call back. I think hes affraid of me. A girl with character scares men. They feel less virile. They are all sissies, thats what they are. Manu, come please. You havent seen Radouan? - No. We dont live together. Tell that dick that hes wanted. When we find him, hes dead. What did he do wrong? - When we find that dick, hes dead. its ok. Dont talk like that or you will die! No jokes, we will come and find you. Understand? Fuck off now. Do you still have some stuff? - Or did you smoke everything? Bah, you really are hopeless. Are we going to drink something? Have you got any money? - I just got my welfare. Are you French enough to get that? I'm going to my brother's. - I dont want to see him. What are you still doing with that damn junkie? Cant you do anything with your shitty life? Mind your own business. There are always problems with you. You are a piece of shit. Can you lend me 300 francs? - Your are daring. Work. You know what that is? - There's no work in France. Thanks. Come, lets go. - Did you get hit, Manu? You saw that. So what? - You should have hit back. I wouldn't take something like that. - I am prepared for anything. We will buy some beer and go for a stroll on the quay. You want me to come? Yes, that would be nice. There are some things... I need to talk to you about. Maybe you can tell me what I have to do. I have an importane meeting now... ...but I will ask what time the last train leaves. OK. - You will give me the address? Juvisy, Htel de la Gare. You cant miss it. They have seen your porn movies. With all those nice details, I think its gross. You help everybody, then you have to hear something like that. If you didnt want to tell it, you should have shut up. Id rather have you know it. - Well, I know it now. I could care less. Shit on them. Bring them to me, Ill make them stand in a row and shit on them. Give me a beer.. You want to be a rebel? Shall I show you what I do to rebels? You havent had enough yet? Stay down. Take her out of there. Lets go! Take off your pants. Strip or I'll kill you. Exchange? Turn around. On your hands and knees. Hurry. Shut up. Its like I am fucking a zombie. Move your ass a bit. What do you think you have between your legs, asshole? Ive had enough. Bitch. Manu. How could you?... How could you let him take you like that? How could you, Manu? They can have done much worse. Were still alive, right? How can you say that? How can you say that?! Because I dont care about their stupid dicks. I have had more in me. You wouldnt leave your car behind with valuable stuff in it either. I cant keep dicks out of my pussy, theres nothing valuable in there. Its only a dick and were only girls. It will be alright. Damnit. I will make you come. You are touching my whiskey without asking and you didnt even put it back. Be happy theres still something in it. Its always the same. With everything I say, you give stupid answers. If you want to live together, there has to be dialog and respect. And you cant cope with that. You really dont have some stuff? Whats up with you? Dont you have enough of being down? Will you give me a Jack? - No. Come on. Here you go, little princess. Damnit asshole. Kill him. Waste him. Stop it. Its a poor guy. - mind your own business. Fuckers. Dont you see hes a poor guy? Dont you see hes whyning? Is he your sweetheart? Do we have to waste you too, bitch? Leave her alone. Understood? I will only tell you once... ok? You, come here. - No. I dont want that. They will kill him. Come here. Hurry up, Mother Teresa. Your big friend Francis called. What do you see in that dirty junk? - What did he say? Nothing. He was totally stoned. And I dont want to see him anymore. When did he call? He will be here for a few days and then hell squat for 3 weeks. He makes a mess, eats everything and spills coffee everywhere. And he shouts at me too. Hes whining because I threw his stuff away... ...because when he doesnt have enough speed, he wants to filter it twice I dont want to see him again. - Please, be quiet now. Stop it please. Youre a fucking idiot. How did you get those bruises? From dickheads like you. They always like to hit me... ...otheriwse they dont feel alive. Did you have a fight again? Youre always stoned. They didnt rape you, right? You havent been raped, right?! Who? - That guy is a real pain in the ass. Hes my best friend, shut your fucking mouth. Your best friend? And you are his best slave... ...and he doesnt give a shit about you. Your best friend. Who was it? Who did it? It doesnt even come to your mind, to ask how I am doing. You are so dumb you make me puke. You dont look tht traumatized. Damnit, you make me puke. Slut... Slut. Good evening. Can I have the number of Francis Godots room? Number 26, second floor. He only payed for 1 person. I only come for the evening blowjob. How is it going? - I am without Subutex. Basic stuff. Can you make a nice prescription for me with nice... ...handwriting. The above right, three boxes of eight. I know. I have done it so many times I know it by heart. Didnt be rude on the prescription. That will cause suspicion. Now is not the time to whine to me about that. Theres something I really cant forget. Do you remember Nolle? You know how she rode her bike over the border, full of acid. I have to get her false papers, but I cant get them. I have to be at the Luxeuil station buffet on the 13th at 12 oclock. Wheres that? - In the Vosges. First class. But I cant be there. You have to give her the papers. Shes driving across the border, with the stuff, her acid. You have to take care of it. Now a days there are enough people with problems. I am going downstairs for a while and my... Thank you. Its nice of you to come. - Thats normal, isnt it? Have you seen it... ...theres pharmacy near the hotel. You know how to choose good hotels. I am asking you something. At the moment there are no trains. Insane. This is going to be a long night. Fuck, no trains till tomorrow night. You arent very social... Where are you going? To Paris. To Paris? Can you drive a car? - Yes. If you can drive, I have a car. And I want to go to Paris. Will you wait for me in Paris? - Not really. Thats convenient. Thats very convenient. I am in a very shitty position. I bet you'll say again that youre having bad luck. I want to see the sea. Take me there. Thats what the car is for, with gas to go back again. Can I ask you something? - What? Have you done any porno movies? Yes. How did you know? Is your boyfriend a fan? I dont have a boyfriend. I'm crazy about it myself. Thats one point for you. God damn. I'm thirsty. Stop please, I have to drink. Further down the road is a gas station - There's the sign. Good news. But you better not do something to me. I really wont do anything. If you want, you can take the car now and drive away. I am going to eat. And you? I dont know. Eat with you. Funny how we met eachother, isn' it? No, its not funny at all. It was now or never. We can see it like that too. - We can go on a journey. With your 10,000 Francs? - I dont want to go anywhere. And I have to be in the Vosges on the 13th. I dont want to screw Nolle. We can stay together till then. Too bad for her. - Damn, I am scared. What a funny feeling. Its going pretty fast actually. You were standing to close to me. I could have shot off your arm. Because of that experience were getting better. What did you think about it? Immediately afterwards I felt bad. Really bad. I wanted to sit down and cry, end of the world atmosphere. But now... ...I feel very good. I would almost feel like doing it... Again, right? Awkward. We dont know if they are looking for us. Don't forget that cops are stupid by nature. But they're also very diligent. And we werent very cautious either. You have to be sharp. From now on we have to drink a lot. And catch some guys. The more you fuck... The less you think and the better you sleep. What would be fun... ...is if you do 69 with us. Fuck off. Did you see how that dick went down. With his expensive suit. Hello... Boom. The face he made. - Stupid fuck. Where are we going? - How would I know. Where luck takes us. And well let the "you can fuck off" side of our souls go its own way I have cut myself everywhere. - Its crazy like that. You dont know anything, its cool. We are far from the Vosges. We have to be there at the 13th. What do we have to do there? Its far away, its cold and ugly. We have an appointment there with Nolle, right? Yes, I forgot. I would advise you to use the Beretta 92f, with the Pachmayr grip, totally stainless steel. Its one of my favouite guns. Its very virile. I think its great. You push the magazine deep into the end... ...you pull the sledge back, unbolt on the side. And the gun is ready to fire. Remember to push the magazine into the end hard. Pull the sledge and unbolt on the side. And if your husband... And if his wife likes to shoot dickheads? We dont have the right answers at the right time. But we do have the right actions. Thats a start. And we arent doing it that bad. No. But those people are going to die. The dialogs need to have some level. Crucial to death. Will we prepare some lines? - Ofcourse not. Then we wouldnt have any ethics. Dont forget to buy some drinks. Did you buy drinks? - Yes. As a kid I spilled my drinks on purpose to get my mom mad. She got sick of it. Damn, I am getting anxious to fuck. Thanks. Youre not playing? You want some coins? You will bring me some luck. Only your dick, nothing else. - But thats dumb. Safe sex. Cant do that anymore. I cant do this. Its against my principles. You cant get it hard. Thats boring. I dont know whats wrong. Maybe if you do it with your mouth for once... You are lucky I have a female concious, pal. Bitch. Thats filthy. I dont get whats so funny about that. Damnit. I chocked myself.. Bitches. Filthy fucking whores. I didnt say you could leave. What we didnt like about you, was your condom. You have been revealed, pal. Your a condom dick. You cant just go around fucking unknown girls. Because you never know who your dealing... pal With killers of condom-dicks. Yuck... Terror in the city. - Is our picture included? No one will recognize us with that. We are just two girls, one big and one small. Do you want to feel my balls against your ass? Fucking bastard. Do you know the way to Biarritz? No, I dont see the signs. Youll have to tell me the way. Me? Are you crazy? Just drive. I have to tell you. Will you just leave me like that? Hello. Can we get a room? The best looking room. - The best... Theres no better room. Are there drinks in the room? - No, but we have drinks down here. How much? - For the best room? 800 Francs. This is a nice Hotel. Very nice. OK... See you later maybe. Dont you think its weird that nothing is happening? You always have strange thoughts about "nothing happening". That we are sitting in a hotel doing nothing after all this. Like everything is allowed. Tactically, its not good to think about things like that. Right. We have to remain mentally strong. Why not start ruining your Jack with Coke. I do what I want. Excuse me... I am thisty. You are thirsty? You want a beer? Good evening. One beer, please. Good evening. Where are you going? To the room. - I am going with you. Thanks, bye. Damnit. Too bad for them. Good evening. - Gendarmerie. Do you have your license and registration? - Ofcourse They should be in my purse. Sorry. I hope you are not leaving me? I also know who you are. For being on the run like this, you dont look that scared. Thats because of our shortage of fantasy. You are going too far. Everyone is scared to die or to end up in prison. Its not about that. Nobody escapes from it. I dont know, but on tv they said you shot a man... ...and a woman without a reason. Does it have a better morals if we want money? We dont have extenuating circumstances. If I would have met you on the bus, I wouldnt have wondered that much. Thats the ultimate trick. Come, girl... Come on. We are going to bed. Are you coming? Are we going to bed? Good night, girls. - See you tomorrow. He reminds me very much of my brother. Reminds me of the house we will get sometime. Thank you. You too? Why dont you go passed the border? Too silly. And what would we do somewhere else? I dont believe is somewhere else. You cant just sit here without doing anything. That cant be. Yes it can. You cant just wait untill they catch you. I am hesitating between jumping from something or burning alive. But to just sacrifice yourself is too arrogant. After our first meeting in Vosges I vote for a jump without a cord. Its a miracle that were still here. I want to end it just as good as it all started. A joke has to have a good point. You will have to push me before the jump. Im too affraid. I dont get it. Dont worry, I will push you. We should write the press a letter too. "They jumped without a cord." Or else they will just make up something. - Yes, communication is important. Concentrate. I dont have all day. Now I missed it. Concentrate please. Dont talk to me like that. You think your brave? What kind of guy is it? - An asshole. I am glad you are paying him a visit. Did he do something to you? - Getting on my nerves. I wouldnt gladly get on your nerves. And the volt is there. The dick lives in a huge castle. Good morning. - Hello, sir. We work for the inquiry firm Lpsos. Would you be so kind to answer some questions about culture-consumption? Sure. Come in. - Thank you. There we go. I am ready. Then we can start immediately. I dont have a tv, but I have heard about you. I had someone else in my mind though. I wouldnt have expected to meet you either. I wont ask how you know me. - That would be misplaced. I dont know anyone like you. You must be different than others. What you do, is... ...extremely violent. You must have suffered very much to become violent like that. I dont know what you went through... ...and I dont know why I trust you. Open the safe, pal. - You are an open book to me. I would be glad to make a deal with you. Get out of the way, asshole. Unbelievable what he was talking about before he opened that damn safe. You already look a lot worse, fucker. No, I wont kill you. - Thank you. Hey, sis... ...kill that son of a bitch. Good evening. Champagne, please. - Later. I will have a walk around - Here. Fuck off. Keep your dirty hands off me! This a fuck club here, not a Mosque. Act like a pig, dickhead. Act like a pig! Strip those pants. Yes, they must have coffee. And with a little luck, we will get some bread too. Then we can stay together. This is not the moment to give up. I cant use that. Dont move! Where is she? - Back off, nothing to see here. Dont move. - Please move back. Dont move. Wheres your friend? where is your damn friend?
