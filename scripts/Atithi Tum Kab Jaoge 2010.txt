These are the forms they come in. The crows are the messengers of these guests. And they announce the arrival of the guests before hand. ""Feel at home."" Guests are usually welcomed home using such words. Big mistake. Because they really start feeling at home. ln the beginning, we enjoy the guest"s company.. ..and the gifts that they bring along. But gradually this germ.. ..slowly spreads around our entire house. Even our ancient scriptures.. ..contain descriptions of this inferior being, guest. Mama Shakuni, Jaichand, Manthara.. ..Musharaff, etcetera.. have all been our esteemed guests. Usually these guests appear during Diwali, Christmas.. ..and summer holidays. But sometimes, they arrive at any given occasion. Scientists around the world are still researching.. ..the arrival and departure of these beings. We"ve learnt from reliable sources.. ..that guests are creatures who have.. ..no fixed arrival and departure time. That"s why they"re called, "A-Tithi" (dateless). Yes, sir. Taneja Arts Present, "Pachaas" (Fifty ). Hail Goddess. Scene no. 1 . The movie begins. The hero is running covered in blood. Cut to, the hero"s legs, he"s running. Cut to, tight close of the hero, he"s running. Cut to side trolley, the hero is running. Cut to crane shot, the hero is running. Cut to, the hero"s legs, he"s running. Cut to, tight close of the hero, he"s running. Cut to crane shot, the hero is running. Cut to side trolley, the hero is running. Cut to POV, the hero is running. Stop it, stop it how long will you make him run. l"m tired. The hero? - No, no not the hero, l"m tired. Run ahead. l mean go ahead. - Yes, sir. While running he comes in front of a shanty. And knocks on the door. Enough, that"s all right. What next? What happened? - After that.. Just a minute, sir. Yes. He breaks down the door. The hero"s deaf sister hears the breaking of the door. She sees the hero and shrieks, ""Brother""! The hero is about to fall.. ..when his disabled father runs and catches him. The hero"s blind brother starts crying at the sight of blood. His tears are falling. The hero"s elder sister who is suffering from Polio.. ..of both the hands wipes his tears. The hero staggers and falls at her mute mother"s feet. And says ""Mother. Mother, l"ve killed Manohar Lal"". Hearing that, the hero"s mother says.. Just a minute, what is all this? What kind of a family is this? The mute mother can speak. The deaf sister can hear. The blind brother can see. The disabled father runs. The elder sister has polio in her hands. What is all this? Oh, no, sir. The story becomes clear.. ..when we go into flashback. Actually 15 years ago Manohar Lal killed.. ..the hero"s sister"s insane husband.. ..on the 50th day of their marriage, just for 50 rupees. The widowed sister banged her hands.. ..so hard on the ground to break her bangles.. ..that they were crippled with polio. Seeing this the mother shrieked so loudly that she lost her voice. And the shriek damaged the eardrums of the sister. Father was so shocked, that he suffered a paralytic attack. And how did the younger brother turn blind? He was blind since birth. ls this a family or a hospital for the deaf, dumb and disabled? This is my family Taneja. Oh, good family. The public will shed tears. The public will shed tears when the mute mother talks. l can"t hear anymore. l"ll leave Taneja. l can"t hear any further. Puneet, go for it. Just go for it. The mute mother"s dialogue should be mind-blowing. l"m writing that, sir. l"m on it. l"m leaving, Taneja. - l"ll see you out. No, you remain seated and listen. Know more about my family. Okay. Hail Goddess. Puneet, come on, start. For the super-hit story. Look, l completely trust my talent and your laptop. lt"s almost done, sir. Sir, if l could get my cheque? You"ll get the cheque too. Why do you worry? Actually, my mummy and daddy are coming over. l have to take them to Ashtavinayak. l have to take them to Siddhivinayak. To Shirdi, to the hospital. - Hospital? l"ve to get them operated. Actually, mother can"t see properly. And father can"t hear properly. My family is very similar to the don"s family. And then, no one gives a concession during recession. And then if you have guests, it really makes things worse. l need to show this to the lead actor. The opening shot is scheduled for after 20 days. lt"s done, sir. - Thank you. Thank you. As per "Vaastu Shastra" (science of architecture).. ..l want my bathroom here, where my bedroom is. - Right. And l want my bedroom here, where my bath is. - Hello. Do you get my point? - l"ll just come. Are you listening J. D? - Yes, yes, Mrs. Khanna you"re right. There it is, okay. - Yes. Mrs. Khanna, last time you said.. ..you want your bedroom where your kitchen is. Remember? - l"ll be right there. You"ve already got it demolished three times. So what? l"ll keep getting it demolished until l"m satisfied. After all it"s not very often that one gets a house made. Yes, but you"re getting it demolished very often. What"s breaking down? - The house is breaking down. Sorry Mrs. Khanna, gender mistake. But don"t worry, there won"t be any mistakes in your design. Munmun will handle it. - Okay. Munmun, just give her what she wants. l"ve to rush off, my wife has an appointment with the doctor. Oh, what happened? - Just a chronic back problem. Take care. - But don"t worry, you"re in safe hands. She"ll do a good job. - Okay. l"ll see you. Bye. - Okay, Munmun. Now look into this book. See here. - Yes. As per page two, it says.. - Hey, Mun. Your phone is ringing. Excuse me, Mrs. Khanna, just a moment. Puneet, where are you? - l"m driving. How many times have l told you.. ..not to talk on the phone while driving. lt"s a new car. Do you know how much we"ll have to pay.. ..if you meet with an accident? And if a police officer sees you.. ..you"ll have to pay him a hundred rupees. Munmun you"re the one who called me. There were three missed calls from you. So, why did you miss my calls? Why didn"t you pick up my calls? l told you that l was driving. So, can"t you answer my call just once? Sometimes you"re so irresponsible l really get worried. Why did you call? - There was a call from Ayush"s school. They"ve called us to the school. Who teaches the child at home? - We do. Don"t you have any values in your family? Your child is so poor in Hindi. Please take special care of your child"s Hindi. He has scored 10 out of 100. He doesn"t even know the meaning.. ..of "Atithi Devo Bhava" (Guest is God). Even l don"t know that. Now l know where the source of this problem is. lt"s not right to blame the child.. ..when the mother herself is ignorant. Goodbye. What does "Atithi Devo Bhava" mean? lt means guests are like God. Like Lord Ganesha. What does Atithi mean? - lt means guest. Those who visit us at home. But no one visits our home. ""Guest, when will you come home?"" Madam, l"m leaving. l won"t be coming tomorrow. l"m expecting guests at home. - What? Papa, even the maid has guests. - Yes. You have a guest everyday at your home. You"re taking so many days off. Now if l have relatives, they"re bound to visit me. l"m leaving. They are highly influenced by movies. They don"t know the importance of guests. They"ll know when they have guests. Papa, won"t we have a guest at home? l planned my holidays last week. Before l receive any guests.. ..l"m going to visit someone with my entire family. Catering to guest can be very risky. l mean it. Be careful. ""Guest, when"ll you come home?"" ""Uncle from Delhi."" ""Aunt from Jaunpur."" ""Rinku, Chintu. Rimjhim, Sweety."" ""Mother"s sister or the father"s."" ""When will you come?"" ""How nice?"" ""When will you come?"" ""Guest, when"ll you come home?"" ""When will you come home?"" ""Guest, when will you come home?"" Stand straight. Stand straight. Don"t move. Another slap and you"ll start bleeding from the other ear. lnsolent. l asked him, ""Where does Pappu live"". He says ""There"s no Pappu here, get lost"". Get lost. And he says, ""Why did you call me watchman"". What do you want me to call you? Obama. ls this how you talk to elders? Hello. - Your guest is here. He slapped the watchman. Do you have a father? What do you call your father? Papa. - Papa. Papa. Give me your papa"s number.. ..l"ll tell him how insolent his child is. Give me his number. Come on. - No. Where are you going? - l said that l made a mistake. He says he"s your uncle. Pappu. Pappu. Pappu. Didn"t you recognise me? l"m uncle Lambodar, from Gorakhpur. Did you recognise me now? No. See that. He wet my waistcloth in Gudiya"s marriage. Guidya.. - From Bareilly. Now do you recognise me? Aunt Dolly"s.. - Yes. No, the aunt, did you recognise me now? l"m Putani"s aunt"s sister"s sister-in-law"s brother-in-law. Lambodar. Putani? - Your father. Now did you recognise me? Yes. Come, touch my feet. Touch my feet. That"s right. This is what you called culture. You should behave properly with elders. Not like you. l"ll slap you again. Will we keep standing here? Pick up the luggage, come on. Come here. Come here. Come here. Keep Rs.10. Get yourself treated.. ..and buy yourself some milk with whatever is left. Get it? Go on, be healthy. Come on, Pappu. Come on. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come on. Hello. Hello. Who is he? - Uncle. Which uncle is he? You never told me that you have a relative in Gorakhpur. Or in Jhansi. - l didn"t know myself. You didn"t know about your own uncle. You"re so irresponsible sometimes, Puneet. lt"s been 12 years since l left Kanpur. lt"s been eight years since father passed away. l"ve never been in touch with anyone. There must be many such relatives.. - But Puneet. Munmun, now he"s here. We can"t do anything. Come and meet him, or he"ll feel bad. Come on. - Come on. Like this? - Why? Wear some clothes. l"m already wearing them. - Wear some more, please. This, this one. Uncle. - Here l am, son. Munmun, your daughter-in-law. Hello. - No, no. You should take the blessings of your elders. Come touch my feet. Touch my feet. Bless you child, bless you. Beautiful, cultured, virtuous. You"re like Laxmi (Goddess of prosperity ). Just like Sarla. Your aunt. You two look like Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati together. lf only Putani had been alive today. He would"ve been very happy to see you two. Putani? - Sorry. My father. Take a seat. l"m really happy to see that you"re doing well. Really. When you have your own home, and your own wife.. ..what else do you want in life? ls he your own son? - Yes, come, come Ayush. Yes. "Atithi Devo Bhava." Remember. - Come, son. "Guest is like God, like Lord Ganesha." Touch his feet. Touch his feet. Let it be, let it be. He"ll do it when he wants to. Respect comes from education. Be seated, l"ll get tea for you. No, l don"t feel like drinking tea now. Uncle farted. - Ayush. Bad manners. - Me, or uncle. Ayush. - He"s very naughty. How long does he plan to stay? - Must be two-four days. Did you make something for him? - He"s not well. Shall l make pilaf for him? Have you had a bath, Uncle? - Yes, son. l had a nice bath under the shower. You have a wonderful bathroom. And that soap, it smells so good. l could see through it. l"ll go dry these clothes. Okay. He used my soap. - He used my towel also. And Baba Ramdev"s purgative worked miraculously. My stomach is absolutely fine now. l"m really hungry, dear. Prepare some rice and lentil with your wonderful hands. And do you have clarified butter? Then make some puffed bread. And some vegetables. And if you have curd, make some side dish. And what"s that called.. radish, cucumber.. Salad, salad. - Yes, make that too. Don"t take too much trouble. Won"t you have some dessert? - That"ll be later, later. Let me finish venerating first. Dessert? Had this been my uncle.. ..your plight would"ve been worth watching. Wow, the food was really delicious. This has reminded me of Sarla. Please have some more, Uncle. We"ll make something else for you. l"ve had enough. l"ve had enough. Dear. Dear, come here, Yes. Here. - Do you want something, Uncle? No, no. l"ve tasted daughter-in-law"s cooking for the first time. lt"s wrong to keep her empty-handed. Keep it, dear, it"s an auspicious gift. May Goddess Annapurna always keep you happy. May no one return from your doors with an empty stomach. Keep it. Ayush, what are you looking here for? Eat the bread, come on eat the bread. No, no, it"s okay. Come here. Which grade do you study in? - Grade? Fine, now tell me.. ..is Delhi closer or is the moon? - Delhi. Wrong. The moon is closer? - You"re lying. Be quiet. How is that, Uncle? Can you see Delhi? - No. And take a look, you can see the moon. - Yes. So which is closer? - Moon. Sorry, you"ll have to sleep outside without the air-conditioner. So what? One has to adjust when there"s a guest in house. lt"s just a matter of few days. Let him sleep in the bedroom. We"ll sleep outside. Seems to be a nice man. Get some room-fresheners tomorrow. We"re out of stock. - Okay. What.. what happened? Mummy. Ayush, when did he come here? He must"ve come here at night. What kind of sound is that, take a look. No, son it"s alright. l think some wild animal has barged in. - Yes. lts okay, Ayush. lt must be a wild animal. What happened? Uncle is gargling. - Gargle? At midnight? - lt isn"t even 5:45. People wake up early in the village. Just to gargle? - Yes. They have early breakfast too. - What? Mun. - Yes. - Have you finished Mrs. Khanna"s design? No, l"m still working on it. What happened? All is well. Puneet"s uncle is visiting us. And you know what happens when there"s a guest at home. He gets up at 5:30 in the morning. And needs breakfast readied at 6:30. That too, after having a bath. Otherwise it"s supposed to be inauspicious. Really? - Yes. ln his village, daughter-in-law"s.. ..can"t enter the kitchen without having a bath. You"re done for, Mun. Munmun, finalise this. - Yes. l"m going to see the doctor, will see you later. What happened? - The same old chronic back problem of my wife. Finalise this. Mun, don"t you feel that J. D"s wife.. ..is spending more time with the doctor than with J.D. By the way, do you know.. ..where l can find "Singhada" flour. "Singhada"? What is that? - l don"t know. But, uncle wants to eat bread made of that flour. Can you believe it? Maid, Sweep that corner. That one. Here. Here. Go on. You can go further ahead, inside. Go on. Yes. Yes. lt"s done. - Done. Now the clothes. - l"ve already washed them. You"ve washed them? - Yes. Fine, now let"s wash them properly. Come on. Puneet, hail the Goddess. - Hail the Goddess. What"s going on? - Yes sir, l"m on it. l"ve finished till interval. lf you"ve finished the interval, then, reach the end too. There"s just 15 days left for the opening take. lf the script isn"t ready, our hero won"t come for the shoot. Son, Mahabharat. Daddy, l"m talking on the phone can"t you see? How are mummy-daddy? Don"t worry about mummy-daddy. Just think about the script. When will you give me the script? l"m on it, sir, l"m on it. Hail the Goddess. - Son, please switch on Mahabharat now. Daddy, ever since the both of you have arrived.. ..you"ve been watching live Mahabharat. Why do you want to see it on television now? Oh, God. What are both of you up to now? You don"t even let me apply make-up. What are you doing, son? Uncle, l"m working. - Working? What do you do? - l"m a writer. That"s okay, but.. what do you do? l write stories. - Wow, even l write stories. But how do you earn a living? Uncle, l write stories for movies. - Wow. How nice, how nice. Go on, go on work with concentration. - Yes. Wow. Very good. Movie stories. Pappu, do you know him.. that movie actor.. - No, no. He"s very tall. He hails from our village. Mr. Amitabh, Mr. Amitabh. - Yes, Amitabh. And, Dharmendra, do you know Dharmendra. No, l only work with the recent actors. The actors these days are not worth it. The real actors were the ones in our era. Dilip Kumar. "Ganga Jamuna". Bharat Bhushan, Rajendra Kumar. Dharmendra. Wow. Tall and a broad chest. And lots of chest hair. Chest hair. lf the fly enters in there, it won"t find his way out. And die right there. The actors these days aren"t like that. They shave their chest. Clean shaven. Like they"ve made it into a runway. You can"t call them actors. And the actresses. You get speechless. Sadhna, Vaijanti Mala, Asha Parekh, Padmini. From top to bottom, they look exactly the same. And they can sit in one place and sing the entire song. At one place. They were so cultured. Hello, there are prayers going on. l should send uncle, right now. Okay, okay. Uncle, there are prayers going on. Downstairs in the building. Would you like to go? - Fine, fine, l"ll be right back from the prayers. Later, l"ll tell you a story about Vaijanti Mala. Yes, yes. - About Vaijanti Mala. This is wrong, l"m completely against it. ls this our culture? Who is he? - He"s our writer"s uncle. - Oh. Hello. - Hello. As long as we play devotional songs from these gadgets.. ..the Goddess will never be pleased. The discourses should come from your heart. Until you don"t chant the discourses.. ..Goddess will never be pleased. We already told them.. ..that this latest technology shouldn"t be in the temple. Of course. - The drums and the flute are all lying is ready. But who will sing? As long there"s devotion, and love for Goddess.. ..in our hearts, anyone can sing. - Yes. Come on, l will sing.

Not that, this. What is this? - Bedroom, sir. No, what is this? - Mrs. Khanna"s design. You sent this design to Mrs. Khanna. - Yes. She wanted the bedroom in place of the bathroom. You moved the bedroom in place of the kitchen instead. Sir, there was so much confusion, she kept changing.. Confusion. Why don"t you do one thing? Why don"t you ask your uncle to construct it? l"m sure he"d also be an interior designer.. ..besides being a doctor. Sorry, sir. - You better be. And if you can"t do it properly, l"ll ask someone else. There are thousands of designers around. Yes. And they wouldn"t have any uncle either. Go on. - Sorry. Baby. lt"s okay. l just can"t handle the pressure. Firstly, Mrs. Khanna changes the plan everyday and confuses me. And l don"t get enough sleep either. l can"t sleep outside in this summer without the AC. And then uncle wakes me up.. ..at 6 o"clock in the morning with his gargling. Then prepare his breakfast, his lunch. Go home and teach Ayush. l just can"t cope up, you know. Didn"t l tell you, guests are good only for a few days? By the way, when is your uncle leaving? God only knows. lt"s been 12 days, he should leave now. Hey, hey.. here, under the table. And listen, sweep it properly. Don"t dust it in the air. Sweep properly. You missed that corner. That corner. Bend down. lt will go further in. lt will go further. That"s it, just stretch your hand. Maid, l can see it from here. Get it out. Madam! Madam! - What happened? What? What happened? l don"t want to work. - Why? As long as this uncle is at home, l don"t want to work. But what"s wrong? Your maid is lazybones. You called me lazybones. - Yes. Do l look like l"m lazybones? Do l look like l"m lazybones? l might look like one, but l"m not. Look, Manda, you.. - No, you watch. Wonder where you got this guest from? He stands on my head.. ..and makes me sweep the entire house. Sweep the dirt from this corner. Sweep the dirt from that corner. l"m a maid after all, not a rat.. ..that l"d go to every corner and sweep it clean. He makes me wash the clothes three times over. l"ve been working in this house for the past three years. Have you ever said anything to me? Have you ever said anything to me? - Look Manda.. Yes, yes. She steals the cream from the milk. She steals tea leaves, sugar. She steals spoons and bowls, and takes it with her. Don"t you. Oh, God. You called me a thief. Thief. - Yes, l did. Do l look like a thief? Do l look like a thief? l look like a thief, but l"m not. But now l don"t want to work in this house.

Dear, l"ll do the sweeping. Dear, don"t worry l"ll do it. lsn"t it? Lazybones. That corner. - Yes, l will. What"s there to laugh about? Who will do the household chores now? You or your uncle? With great difficulty l had found a maid.. ..but he made her leave. Do you realise what he has done? He turned the maid out. Do you know the importance of a maid in a woman"s life? l know, l know. A woman can live without her husband.. ..but not without the maid. You can find another husband. But a maid.. He turned the maid out. l"m not going to cook for him. Order from the hotel. We"ve already eaten five times from the hotel this time. We"ve already spent a lot. Then, we"ll have "Pav-bhaji" on the streets. But l"m not cooking for him. Okay. - Okay. Son, this is a heavy snack. Hey, give me some butter. No, no, don"t be a miser. Daughter-in-law. Cook something light for dinner. Lentil, rice, flatbread, few vegetables. And we"ll have dessert later. Oh, God what has happened? The stomach is feeling so heavy. He seems to have cooked in cheap oil instead of butter. Uncle, take this medicine. No, no, Uncle. This is gas. Let it flow, don"t try to stop it. You"ve been passing wind since morning. Please take this medicine. How long will he keep doing this? As long there"s air in the atmosphere.. ..it will.. go on. That"s why l"m saying, take this medicine. l can"t take it, son. - Why can"t you take it? l mean, why can"t you take it, Uncle? l"m a vegetarian.

Sorry, sorry. The dirt.. Hey, Kaalia. Are you the actor or the director of the film. Who asked you to say two? lt isn"t my mistake. The old man has been troubling me since. He"s been asking ""How many were they?"" ""How many were they?"" So l said two. Couldn"t you say something else? Why did you have to say two? Where is that old man? Which old man? He"s standing right there. - This old man? Who are you? Which department are you from? Who are you? Make up, setting, junior artist? Which department are you from? Where are you from? Who are you with? - l"m with Pappu. Who is Pappu? Who is Pappu? Who is Pappu on this set? - Pappu. Who is Pappu? - There he is. Puneet, you didn"t tell me you"re Pappu. And he"s with you. He"s my uncle, sir. - lf he"s your uncle.. ..is he attending my wedding procession here? Am l getting married? Are we playing the bands? He destroyed a set worth Rs.50 lakh. Who will pay for the reconstruction of the sets? Him? Do you know how much money Rs.50 lakh is? Have you ever seen it? They come here to eat for free at film parties, beggars. Sir. Please, sir, don"t abuse him. He"s an elderly man, l apologise. He"s like a father. Your father could have made such a mistake as well. lf he"s like your father, then keep him at home. Why bring him to the shoot to.. - Sir. No need to abuse him. lf you say another word.. - What will you do? What will you do? Are you threatening me? Do you know your stature? You"re an ordinary writer, trying to threaten me. l"m throwing you out of the film right now. Now come to my office to collect the cheque. Come if you have the guts. l"ll give you nothing. Who do you think you are? You"re locking horns with me.. for this old man. You"re putting your career at stake. l"ll see who gives you work in the industry. Security, throw the old man out. Throw him out. - Hey.. No one touches him! Let"s go, Uncle. Pack up. Hail Goddess. So, Uncle, how are you? How are you, dear? Do l look like your daughter? - Do l look like your uncle? Have you ever seen yourself? You look like a grandma, great grandma in fact. You don"t have much time to live. You"re walking towards your grave. See that, she calls me uncle. That"s wrong, Sister. Uncle is so young. Be quiet or else l"ll call your papa. What"s the matter? - See that. Whenever we meet, all he says is, ""l"ll call your papa"". He"s so short-tempered. He has high-blood pressure. And has ordered for fritters. You people really lose your mind after a certain age. Nothing"s wrong with him. After what he did yesterday at the opening shot.. ..he doesn"t have the courage to say anything. He didn"t even gargle this morning. And l didn"t wake up. l was sleeping. Now you better wake up. You"ve lost the film already. Before you lose anything else ask him to leave, please. See there he is. Please. Please do something. Okay. You"re back, Uncle. Come. Listen, Pappu. l need to talk to you. l want to talk to you too. - No, listen to me first. Look, what happened yesterday wasn"t my mistake. l didn"t do it intentionally. l swear on Sarla, really. We hail from small villages, son. We don"t know how to behave with influential people. l don"t have any children. But after staying with you people for so many days.. ..l felt that you aren"t Putani"s son, but mine. And.. l couldn"t control myself seeing you happy. And.. l made this mistake. Please don"t be angry with me. lf you want l"m ready to fall at his feet. But please forgive me. What are you doing, Uncle? lf my father had made the same mistake that you did.. ..would he apologise to me? Or would l let him apologise? With your blessings, l"ll find more work. Just like Putani. Putani had the same thinking. Really. Pappu hasn"t changed after coming to the city. l"ll tell everyone when l go back to the village? When will you go back? - l mean, when will you go back? Tell me in advance, because.. ..we need to book the ticket two months in advance. Yes son, l will tell you two months in advance. l won"t trouble you anymore. Daughter-in-law, l"ve brought sweets. Make me a cup of tea. ""l"ve lost my peace."" ""l"ve lost all my happiness."" ""Look how sad you"ve made us that we"re crying."" ""l wonder when you"ll leave.""

""Guest, when will you leave?"" You ape, you"ve come here to die. Commander, kill him. Pardon me, brother. He"s our guest. And we should show respect to our guests, not disrespect. Vibhishan, sit down. He"s not a guest. This guest has devastated my Ashoka gardens. He trampled the delicate flowers.. ..of my beautiful Mandodari. He killed my soldiers and created havoc in entire Lanka. He has made my life hell. First the soap, towel, bathroom, bedroom.. ..and now he has taken over the entire house. Keeps the television switched on all night and doesn"t let us sleep. Pappu. - ln the morning he wakes us up with his gargling. He has created havoc in the whole house by constantly breaking wind. l lost my work, l lost my maid, . ..and you want me to show respect to the guest. Sorry, Puneet. What do you say, Mandodari? Don"t you know anything? You"re so irresponsible, you know. Teach this guest a lesson.. ..so that he never visits anyone as a guest again. He"s a sinner. Okay. Soldier, set his tail on fire. Pappu. Pappu. Pappu, what are you doing? Cut, cut, cut. How did Hanuman"s tail come off? l"ve been asking for the past three days to get a new tail. l"ve been working with Sugreev"s tail. What?

Dear, l was sitting at home and watching television.. ..when l received a call, that Sarla, your aunt.. ..has been bitten by a dog, and she passed away. Uncle, then what are you doing here? You should be in the village along with aunt. lsn"t it, Puneet? Yes. - With aunt? How could l? She left five years ago. Where? - To the heavenly abode. What are you saying? - Yes.

Yes, l"m paying for the mistake that l made by marrying you. l"m leaving. Take care of your child and house alone. Fine, go and don"t come back. Yes, l won"t come back. Finally my eyes have opened. Did you take sleeping pills before getting married? - Daughter-in-law. Daughter-in-law, where are you going. Wait, Daughter-in-law. Uncle, please move aside. All my friends had warned me against marrying him. Then why didn"t you listen to them. Listen to me.. - Be quiet, Uncle. That Bhatinda girl was much better compared to you. Bhatinda girl? Which Bhatinda girl? You lied to me, didn"t you? You liar. l will.. Uncle. You hit my uncle. You hit my respected uncle. lt"s your fault. Why did you duck? What happened, dear? Tell me what happened? Ask her. - You tell me. Uncle, don"t ask me, ask him. Fine, both of you tell me what"s wrong. Uncle, she has a friend in Delhi. She"s getting married day after tomorrow. And she wants both of us to go there. She wants me to leave you alone and come with her. Who will take care of your diet? So l said, if l tell uncle how important it is.. ..for us to go, then uncle will leave for Gorakhpur. l will never tell uncle to go. Uncle, please explain him. You aren"t going forever. - Yes. Daughter-in-law is right. But.. - Daughter-in-law is absolutely right. And you"ll throw daughter-in-law out of the house.. ..for such a trivial reason. Had Putani been alive today he would"ve died again seeing this. Apologise. Apologise to daughter-in-law. Sorry. - Sorry. See that, you fool. Daughter-in-law, l apologise on his behalf. You"re absolutely right, dear. l"ll leave tomorrow morning. Fine. But, the ticket has to be booked two months in advance, so.. l"ve booked the ticket. l"ve booked it.

Who cooks for me in Gorakhpur, tell me? Sarla is no more. l cook for myself. That"s it. l jumped off at Thana station, and came here. And your neighbour opened the door for me.

Son, it"s gone to the garage. lt"s broken down, that"s why. lt hasn"t gone to the garage. They took our car away because you didn"t pay for it. That"s what Raju"s father is telling everyone. You"re a liar, l don"t want to talk to you. Ayush. He"ll come back. Look, son. Today the festival of Lord Ganesha begins.. ..and the both of you were in Delhi. So l brought and idol of Lord Ganesha home. Lord has come here, but only as a guest. He"ll stay here only for 11 days. But when he leaves, he"ll take all the problems with him. l"ve only one problem. Lord Ganesha is there. He"ll solve all your problems. The Lord will leave in 11 days. But when is he going to leave? l know that guests are like God. But Their duty is to come, bless His devotees.. ..with His grace and leave. Goddess Durga comes only for nine days in "Navratri". Lord Ganpati will be immersed after 11 days. But when will he leave. God, l can"t take this anymore. Do you know why we venerate Lord Ganesh first? - Why? One day Lord Ganesh and Kartike had an argument.. ..about who"s more intelligent. Then they approached their parents. To Shankar-Parvati. Lord Shiva said ""whichever one of you.. ..completes seven rounds of earth first.. ..will be known as the most intelligent one"". So what happened next? - They had a race. They had a race. Kartike"s carrier was peacock. So he flew away on his peacock. Lord Ganesha, thought for a moment. He used his intelligence. He took the blessings of his parents. And His carrier is.. The mouse. - Mouse. He sat on the mouse, and took seven rounds around his parents. They asked him, ""What did you do"". He replied, ""Whether you call it earth, or my world.. ..my parents are everything for me"". Lord Shankar was very pleased to hear this. He said, ""Ganesh, whenever there"s a veneration performed.. ..anywhere in the world, you will be venerated first"". Otherwise, that veneration won"t be successful. That"s why, Lord Ganesha is the God of Gods. Because he respects his parents. Son, there"s nothing greater than your parents in the world. Get it. So say, glory to.. - Lord Ganesha. ""Oh, Lord Ganesh, the giver of the joys and the destroyer of sorrows."" ""Who waives off calamity whose blessing gives enough love."" ""His body is resplendent with a beautiful orange color."" ""He has a pearl necklace shining around his neck."" ""Pray to this auspicious idol, praise the Lord."" ""At mere glimpse of him, all of your wishes come true."" ""Praise the Lord."" ""The jeweled crown is for You, oh, son of Paravati."" ""With sandalwood paste smeared on His body.. ""..and saffron red color on His forehead."" ""That jeweled crown looks beautiful."" ""The bells of the anklets make a lovely tinkle on Your feet."" ""The bells of the anklets make a lovely tinkle on Your feet."" ""The bells of the anklets make a lovely tinkle on Your feet."" ""Pray to this auspicious idol, praise the Lord."" ""At mere glimpse of Him, all of your wishes come true."" No, no we can"t release your car. You"re three months instalment is due. Sir, l"m paying two months instalment. No, nothing can be done. Sir, l"ve promised my child. Why do you make such false promises? Look, the manager is very strict. He"ll never understand. Pappu. Didn"t you recognise me? l"m Niranjan, Niranjan Tripathi. l came to your home with uncle Lambodar. Dukhbhanjan, Ranjan, Niranjan. And he called me Manoranjan. Did you recognise me now? "l follow only one principle." "Greet everyone with a smile." "We should never fall short of friends." l"m the manager here. Patil, come here. - ""Praise the Lord."" Arrange for tea, he"s my acquaintance. He writes for films. - Yes. Come, take a seat. - l"ll order for tea. Come, come take a seat. ""Praise the Lord."" ""Praise the Lord."" ""Praise the Lord."" ""Praise the Lord."" What did you teach your child that he has turned so brilliant? He has scored 85 out of 100 in Hindi. Gayatri Mantra, Shlokas. He recites discourses, which even we don"t remember. When l asked him, ""who taught you, son"". He said, ""uncle"". Who is this uncle, l would like to meet him as well. Very nice, very nice. He"s a very nice boy. ""Pray to this auspicious idol, praise the Lord."" ""At mere glimpse of Him, all of your wishes come true."" ""With a big belly, a yellow silk garment.."" ""..and a serpent around His waist."" ""A straight trunk that is bent at the end, and three eyes."" ""Ramdas awaits You at his doorstep."" ""God, please bless us when there is trouble and protect from disaster."" l"m standing before you. Give me the offerings. Puneet, you knew my parents were here. My mummy can"t see properly. She mistakenly knocked down a vase. lt was an imported one. My wife got it from Dubai. My wife insulted them. He yelled at them. They kept crying, and listening to the rebukes.. ..and l kept watching. When l got up in the morning, l found out.. ..that they went back without telling me. Today l realised what a lowly man l am. There"s me, l quietly kept listening.. ..when my parents were getting rebuked at. And there"s you, that left his career.. ..just because l said something to your uncle. l respect you. l"m sorry. l"m a coward. At home l"m scared of my wife. Outside l"m scared of the hero. When the movie releases in the theatre on Friday.. ..l"m scared of the audience. l"m sorry. What are you saying, sir? You"re my senior. l"m senior, but l"m junior to you in abiding by relations. Here"s the cheque, for the movie. And l"m making another film, "Baghban" type. Here"s the signing amount. l"ve talked to Mr. Amit. Tomorrow l"m going to bring my parents back. l"ll come back the next day, The day after that we"ll go to Khandala for the sitting. And we"ll come back on the fourth day with a super-hit idea. l completely trust my talent and your laptop. Uncle. Hello. What can l say? Macmohan is asking for you. ""Praise the Lord.""

""..and protect from disaster."" ""Praise the Lord."" ""Praise the Lord."" Come on. Where are they? - We left them right here. Ayush, come. - Where were you? Uncle? - Where is Uncle? l"ve been looking for him. l went to get balloons for Uncle. l asked him to stay here. Wonder where he is. Where could he be? Let"s look. You look that way, l"ll look for him here. - Fine. Ayush, stay with me. Did uncle come back? - No, he went along with you. Have you heard, there has been a stampede.. ..at Juhu during Ganesh immersion. There was a chaos suddenly. Many were injured. The situation is very bad. They"re showing it on television. lt"s truly regretful for this to happen.. ..on such an auspicious occasion. You can see the photographs.. ..of this place, for the first time only on our channel. People here are looking for their family member. There"s no.. You can see the bad condition that is here. Uncle. Save him, save him. l"ll go take a look. You stay here. You go sir, he"ll be absolutely fine. l"m there. l"ll come along as well. Manasi Joshi, along with cameraman Santosh. News of every moment only for you. Come on, come on. Move back. lf you want to see the injured, go to Cooper hospital. Go there. Let"s go. Lambodar. - There"s no one by that name. Go to Nanavati, the dead bodies have been taken there. Lambodar. - There"s no one by that name. Go to Nanavati, the dead bodies have been taken there. People have died? Go on. No he hasn"t returned yet. His luggage is here as well. - Where are you? On my way to Nanavati hospital. The dead bodies have been kept there. His name isn"t amongst the one injured. God. l hope he"s alive. - My God. Did you find out anything? They haven"t retrieved the bodies from the sea yet. We"ll know in the morning. lsn"t this what we wanted? For uncle to leave. Now that he has left, why are we worried? Puneet, you"ve been so irresponsible. No, no. Pappu don"t pay him. He"s asking for too much. The fare from the station to here is just Rs.1 7. Liar. The fare is just Rs.1 7. Where have you been? - Son, l was.. Where have you been all night? l searched for you at Juhu, but couldn"t find you. Then l went to V.T. To buy a ticket. See this, l stood in the queue all night.. ..and reached the ticket window only in the morning. But that"s okay. l bought a "Tatkal" ticket, and l"m leaving tomorrow. Okay. Couldn"t you call? Do you know what we"ve been through all night? What happened? Ayush spent all night crying. Your daughter-in-law, that Godbole. Do you know how worried they all were? That watchman whom you had slapped. His duty ends at eight but he didn"t go home all night. We were searching for you like crazy.. ..and you couldn"t even inform us? Forgive me. l did have your number, it was in my diary. But the diary fell down somewhere. l thought if l tell you, you"ll ask me to stay back again. l"ve stayed here for long enough. How long does a guest stay back, son. The Goddess leaves in nine days. Lord Ganesha left in 11 days. Uncle, l didn"t.. - Just a minute, Mun. Wait here. You leave right now, we can"t wait until tomorrow. l made a big mistake, l apologise son. l apologise to you. We made a mistake. Puneet, calm down. - Just a minute, Munmun. She looked after you for so many days but you don"t care about that. Just because you overheard her saying something once, . ..it"s our mistake. We don"t have the patience or the culture.. ..to welcome guests at our home. Please leave. Listen, son. l.. - Please leave. We never wanted any guests to visit us. But he, he never understood. He would always keep asking.. ""When will the guest arrive?"" You came, and we liked it. But for how many days? After four days we wondered, ""When will he leave?"" l always wished, if my father were alive he"d live with us. But had my father been in your place.. ..we would"ve behaved the same way with him. The parents can keep the children with them for all their lives. But children start thinking, ""When will they leave"". Our son will do the same thing with us in future. And we deserve it. Please leave. Please leave. Just like Putani. Putani would start crying just like that. You"re right, son. But a guest should understand his duty. He wont be respected like God if he stays back for so many days. And even the Lord leaves after 11 days. And that"s why we wait eagerly for Him. And we ask him come back soon. l will come back again next year, son. l will come back. l won"t be able to stay away from all of you for long. Really. Stop, stop, stop. Puneet, what"s wrong? Why is there a crowd here? Hello. - Uncle. Who are you? - l"m Putani"s son, didn"t you recognise me? Pappu. Pappu? - Yes. So aren"t you Pappu? - You made me Pappu. Oh, God.. son, l barged into the wrong house. What was your address? lt was written room no. 703. A wing or B wing? - l don"t know that. But Madhuri just wrote room no. 703. Actually, our room numbers are same.. ..but they"re in different wings. You rascal, your guest has been staying in our house.. ..for the past one month, and you"ve been watching the fun. Sorry, but didn"t l tell you.. ..that l"m troubled by the frequent visits by my guests. So l went out for month as a guest myself. That"s okay, son. Thank God l met you otherwise.. ..l would"ve left without meeting the real Pappu. That"s okay. - You"re leaving, Uncle. l"m leaving. - Okay. No, no how is that possible? You"ll have to stay with the real Pappu for few months. Yes, Uncle. - Otherwise Putani"s soul won"t rest in peace. Yes, yes. Yes. Sarla. You speak just like Sarla. Pappu. - Yes, Uncle. Yes. - Not you, the real Pappu. Pick up the luggage, son. And touch his feet.
