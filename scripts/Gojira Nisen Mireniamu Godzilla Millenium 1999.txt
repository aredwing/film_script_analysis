Turn west by 18 degrees. Roger. What's that? The change in density of scattering plasma is expressed in the form of voltage regulation. In other words, when a sign of fluctuation of dielectric charge occurs on the earth's surface, the plasma in the sky above is induced to the ground. A kind of systematic law is created between the plasma and the tremor in the ground. In short, a seismometer. What are you trying to do with it? You're slow, old maid. Old maid?! The epicenter doesn't wander. If it moves at a fixed speed... What does it mean? It's coming, Dad. Yes! It's coming! We still can't get in touch with the fishing boat. Maybe it went to another port because of the fog. Or maybe their radio is out of order. Godzilla 2000- Millennium Recently something's wrong with the sea. So we've got nothing to do but drink. Right, buddy? What are you saying? You're on the booze every night. Now the bar's closed. - And earthquake! - It's big! If you want to get down, go now. I'm okay. Better still, worry about your own daughter. lo is my partner. Here we go! Too Close. Dad! Come on! Come on! You're rather young for a deputy chief cabinet secretary. You're also chief of Crisis Control Intelligence Agency. It's come up to level 3. Excuse me. Level 3? Yes, sir. - You mean it landed? - At Nemuro, sir. I'll call for a Cabinet decision for a military campaign. The landing spot is fogbound. It's no use to campaign. lo! Steady! Steady! It's better, isn't it? Not at all! Why not take some pictures? That's what you came here for. Right? Honestly, I didn't want to take this job! I've got enough! Change your film cartridges. Does Godzilla hate the energy created by human beings? Japan Trench off East Coast Finished installing a G Sensor at Point 23. Depth: 5300. Heading ten degrees right! Like a forest of chimneys. What's that? You said you'd give me a job with a computer magazine after shooting Godzilla at Nemuro, didn't you? But you got nothing on film. Even a little radioactivity, though harmless to your body, can ruin your film. Continue the hunt! Not that father and daughter again! Don't complain. They're a headache Mr. Kimura in Matsushima? - This is Shinoda in Tokyo. - Hello. About the data you sent me just now... That's right. The temperature of the sea water off Kinkazan at 38 degrees 15 minutes North is a little too high. Fasten here as tight as you can. Okay? Sure. I'll do it. Excuse me. Is Godzilla Prediction Network here? Network? Oh, yes. Well... eh... you see, go over there, turn left, and then turn right. That's the short cut. Turn left, then right? - Get moving! Move your hands! - I'm sorry. Anyway, go to the left, and you'll see. What's wrong? "Short Cut" Excuse me. Ichinose is back. How's the concentration of radioactivity? Normal. Good. What does the seismometer say? Excuse me! So you want to work with us again. Let's have a contract. "Admission fee: 200,000 yen. Monthly dues: 50,000 yen. " What's this? For membership. The members will predict the damage by Godzilla and study the right investment and business strate I'm not going to be a member of your "Godzilla Prediction Network. " Okay? I just want to continue my research. In that case, too, you'll have to be a member. That's the rule. Mr. Shinoda! I'm in charge of business. Fortunately, we're in a special service month. We can offer you the Private Membership course at a very reasonable price. How about it? Crisis Control Intelligence Agency (CCI) This material has very high magnetism. It might be able to replace uranium as a new and better source of energy. - A meteorite? - Probably. If this discovery leads us to the creation of clean energy, it means a lot to our CCI Agency. Balloons are filled up with air. Aqua lift system, stand by. To the surface. Understood. To all ships, start lifting! It's moving too fast! It's rising on its own! What's up? In Nemuro, east-by-northeast wind, velocity 9. "Ultra Close Shots on Godzilla!" In Urakawa, north-by-northwest wind, velocity 7. Fair... - Supper's ready. - I'm coming. In Hakodate, southwest wind, velocity 3. Cloudy 9.0, This is "Godzilla Prediction Network. " Hold the line, please. GPN2031. Oh, it's Mr. Sonoda in Fukushima. I've been catching slight tremors all this evening. The epicenter is moving to the south. Young Master. Chasing Godzilla again? Yeah. Give me your hands. You stink. No, your hands. Chemical, goodbye. Goodbye. See you again. Hello. What? The epicenter moving? Thank you, sir. You said "a reasonable price. " You didn't say I'd have to pay the toll charge. Start dropping. We tried to excavate the rock. But we hit some very tough material. We can't dig it anymore. How old are the layers on the rock? The deepest one is sixty to seventy million years. Why is it floating? Logically, it can't float in the water. But if it surfaced of its own will... Own will? It can be a life form possibly from outer space. Level One acknowledged! Katagiri speaking. I understand. I'll go there immediately. Is it him? The sea-bottom sensors are showing he's going down south off the Ibaraki Coast. Take care of this place. Eventually, the epicenter is still going south. At this rate... The nuclear power plants in Tokai Village. Probably. What if the nuclear plants are destroyed? This is Katagiri of Crisis Control Intelligence. Godzilla might land at Tokai Village. Shut down the power plant reactors immediately! Shut down? But I'm not in a position... The government appointed me to cope with emergencies. I'm authorized to order you! Shut down now! Stop the reactor! Shut it down! Stop it down! Godzilla may land at Tokai Village on the east coast of Ibaraki Prefecture. Regarding it as a crisis, the government held an emergency Cabinet meeting. They decided to send the Self-Defense Corps to the landing spot. Why don't we choose a safer place for observation? Would anyone wanting to climb Mt. Everest be satisifed by standing on a hilltop instead, just because it's safe? Now Katagiri has his entrance. Katagiri? The Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary and boss of CCI. It's been a long time, Professor Shinoda. I quit the university lab a long time ago. I know. If you'd stayed, I'd have roped you in together with Miyasaka, when CCI was established. I'd have turned you down. My ideas are totally different from yours. What's wrong with killing Godzilla? Biologically, Godzilla is a very special existence. It's full of unimaginable mysteries. To study Godzilla will be the key to disclose the secrets of living beings on the earth. Even so, you can't allow all the damaged caused by Godzilla. That's why I organized the Godzilla Prediction Network. It's to find the movement of Godzilla as soon as possible and minimize the damage. You're welcome to my network. I'll give you a discount. This is the last day for your network. To stop reactors isn't enough. Stop all energy sources in this area. I'm Takada, head of the First Division. I'm in command of this operation. Do you really think you can kill Godzilla? Terrible! Tank battalion ready to attack by 0530. Ready by 0530. Understood. As we learned from experience, Godzilla, when attacked, definitely advances towards its attackers. We can make use of its atrocious aggressiveness and lead it to the mouth of the Kuji River. If people fall victim, it's a failure. I'm taking it into consideration. What if Godzilla ignores us and heads for the nuclear power plant? In that case; "Blast bombs" buried in the ground will block Godzilla's way to the reactor. Fine. You drive it down to the river. Then what? We developed a new weapon especially for this day. It's a new type of full-metal missile that will penetrate anything, not just to blast it. It's totally different from conventional ones. It can drill Godzilla's skin, no matter tough he is. - lo. - Hey. What now? Go with lo to a safe place and collect materials. What will you do? I want to watch Godzilla. Katagiri seems determined to kill him. The mines laid by the Marine Corps. It must be Godzilla. He's coming! Get moving! Target on! Nose missile away! Wait till it gets closer. Fire! Move out! Move out! Full-metal missiles. Fire! It responds to the movement of the sun. As things are... As things are, what will happen? lo! Radio call for you, sir. - Katagiri speaking. - This is Miyasaka. The rock took off to the sky! What's that? You said the sea. I thought of swimming. You told me to bring a net. I thought of insects. What are you thinking, fools? What's that?! What was that huge flying object? If only it hadn't come... Kitaura, Kashima City, Ibaraki Prefecture It's quite natural to think the object came from outer space. Why does it come back after sixty million years This is a conjecture. The energy source of the object is light. When it landed on earth, it sank in the deep sea where sunlight couldn't reach it. Then the deep-sea submarine cast a light on it, and it woke up. It might be dangerous to human beings. It could defeat that mighty Godzilla. Certainly it has tremendous destructive power. But I hear it stopped all its action. It's necessary to take proper countermeasures. Take an analysis scan on the thing. If it's an alien life form, it must produce a reaction. Finished fixing CD wire. Turn the crane west by 20 degrees. Okay, okay. What about Godzilla? The naval and air forces are desperately trying to find it. Stop! All fighters! Keep 300 meters from target, - sensor in scanning mode. - Stand by, okay. Sonar-scanning is starting now. No life reaction. But it has something enclosed. Liquid or gas, or something... How can it fly? I can't deny the existence of an advanced science far superior to ours. Prof. Miyasaka, a call for you. Miyasaka speaking. What? Shinoda wants to see me. He wants to use CCI's up-to-date equipment to search for Godzilla. One word, please. There's no news for you. That thing has no sign of movement. You think it'll move again? Yuki! Who said you could call me by my first name? Come with me... as a servant. This is a chance for you to collect materials directly. Okay? Maybe as your "assistant. " What happened? It's on, and I didn't know. Was it connected to your cellular? No way. Then how could somebody get into your mobile? You were the last man I'd ask for something. Tell me. Where's Godzilla now? Search me. Wish you'd tell me. You can use the CCI equipment on one condition. Give us all your data on Godzilla. It's a deal! Let's go back to Tokyo. I found the data in my mobile that got hacked. The Godzilla file. If you give them our data, what'll become of our "Godzilla Prediction Network?" No argument. Bring the MO disk of the data on Godzilla. I want you to help me with my summer vacation homework. All right. Bring it, too. These photos are of Godzilla's skin found in Tokai Village. The first one clearly shows scars and traces of damage, but the second one shows none. The same piece of skin? Only five hours between the photos. What remarkable healing ability! All the layers of skin - granulate, prickle and basement - are alive. What a creature! It's invincible! The question is why the Godzilla cells can revive. It must have something to do with the radioactivity stock in Godzilla's body. Let's take out a cell and enlarge it. Yes, let's. This is it! So this helps Godzilla's miraculous recovery. Recovery of cells and formation of solid form... The peculiar formative substance has two functions. It's like the origin of life. We can be its godfather. Actually you found it. You have the right to name it. Let me see. Organizer-G1. Organizer-G1? - The Clouds are disappearing. - Don't panic. That thing is doubly blocked with powerful electromagnetic barriers. Even if it regains its functions, it can't take off again. If Organizer G1 is the secret of Godzilla's remarkable healing ability and vitality, we might be able to make use of it for medical treatments. If we materialize the idea, it'll be wonderful. This is only a part of the mysteries of Godzilla. I feel as if we were back in the university laboratory. Why did you quit? Our science is going too far, and human beings are too coerced. I was scared of them... Come in. Excuse me. Here's a girl who calls herself lo Shinoda. Have you brought it? The electromagnetic barriers have been broken! You and your trick! Because... I didn't want to ruin the Godzilla Prediction Network. But they'll soon find out. That's you MO, isn't it? Let's get away. Shinoda! The giant UFO flew away! The object is flying over Yotsukaido. Liquid or gas, can it be a living thing, if it has no organism? It's been asleep for sixty million years. No, for a longer time it must have been drifting in outer space before it reached this planet. Is that why it discarded its organic body? Scanning helicopter! You're too close! This news program will continue. Here's a special bulletin. Three CCI helicopters were crushed by the mysterious flying object above Makuhari, Chiba Prefecture, at 5:20 P.M. today. All the six men of the crew died. It's advancing west by northwest. The people in the areas along the flight course should be very careful. We're in danger. We repeat. The people in the areas along the flight course should be very careful. Meanwhile, following the government decision, the Self-Defense Corps was ordered to stop the giant UFO. Look! We can get a scoop! Go up to the roof! It's no time for that! Get away! Go to the roof! What are you saying? It's a big scoop! Block the streets around City Tower! Do all you can to lead the people in the building to safety! I understand. Keep all aircraft away, including the media, from the sky above Shinjuku. The area one kilo from City Tower must be evacuated. We'll start helping evacuation. Yuki! Come on! Run! Now that some people fell victim, we must try our best to destroy the giant UFO. Fortunately, it's going to be sunset soon. But the UFO might resume its destruction in the morning. What's tomorrow's weather? Fair. Let's use "blast bombs. " We've got to take care of it tonight. When will it fly up? We've been waiting long enough. At present, all traffic and transport facilities to this area are stopped. The area around City Tower is blocked completely. The area to be evacuated is Shinjuku and West Shinjuku, from First Street to Six Street. Take a good look! It's like a scene of the end of the world! This giant flying saucer that appeared in the sky above the capital of Japan is still staying immobile, as if challenging mankind, the ruler of this planet. Looking down at us from the sky, it gives us an impression that it's trying to reign over us... All computers in the Shinjuku Area are out of order. - Protect the crisis control data! - Yes, sir. The main computer at Anti-Hacking Center doesn't work. The computers in the area are defenseless. The computers at KDO and other key stations are out of order, too. What's happening? Miyasaka Use a polaroid lens! Tendrils! They're hacking the supercomputer of City Tower, collecting a great amount of information on human beings. Visualize the access route! Use the linkage tracer. Chief, at this rate, the safety of the entire world is in jeopardy. This whole thing can be terminal. Human beings have dangerous desires; invasion called science, thoughtless curiosity... If CCI hadn't picked it up, somebody else would have done the same in the near future. Am I one of those reckless scientists? Eh? - The special engineer unit set off. - Good. Something's wrong with the atmosphere around the giant UFO. The oxygen content of the air is gradually lowering. The balance of construction is getting out of order. How long do you need to set up the bombs? - About thirty minutes. - And to pull out? Ten minutes will be enough to get to the safety zone. Hello. Finally it's connected. Yuki? Guess where I am. In a few minutes, I'll find out what they're after. You can't be in City Tower, of all places! Get out of there! They're going to change the atmospheric content! I know. But I can't get out now. We've got to know why they're interested in Godzilla. I'll find out. Hello! Hello! What a troublesome "assistant!" We're on the 51 st floor. We're starting to plant the bombs. Hey, stop! Wait! Let me go! Mom's in the Tower! I want her! Let us pass! Her mother's in the building! Let us pass! Go quickly, Mr. Shinoda. This building will detonate very soon. But how... Mr. Miyasaka's instruction. What are you doing? Get out of here quickly! I'm beginning to know what the aliens want. You've got to get out! We're going to detonate this building. Go ahead. What'll you do? I'll go as soon as I get this data. Find a guard and ask him to tell Katagiri to postpone detonation. Hurry! Dad, be sure to come back. I promise. Put on some speed. Finished setting the blast bombs. Starting to pull out. Detonation at 21:10. We'll be waiting. Wireless. The two persons who went into City Tower haven't returned yet. Who gave them permission? Me. Pull all the guards back! Immediately! Wait! - Stop! - Yes. Don't detonate the building now! Dad is there on the 48th floor! Tell Mr. Katagiri of CCI to postpone detonation! A man is still in the building. Can't you postpone detonation? No delay. Just as scheduled. The man is Shinoda. No change of schedule. It's done! "Millennium" Millennium? There's no time! Follow me! - Dad! - Wait, lo! Let me go! Dad's in the building! It's too late! It's too late now! Don't do it! It's a dead end. I can hear something. lo! Dad! Somehow I managed to survive. They want to change the earth's atmosphere so that it'll be suitable for their living conditions. The key word is "Millennium. " What does it mean? Millennium Kingdom. They want to build their own country on earth. They want to know something else. This. Why are they interested in Godzilla? You got your summer vacation homework? Something without form can take on a form. Organizer-G1! Godzilla's in Tokyo Bay! How about stopping the supply of electricity in Tokyo? If there's no energy to take, Godzilla will go away. No use. I think so, too. There's only one thing on Godzilla's mind. That's right. Revenge. Look! Tentacles! Is that Organizer G1? What's wrong? Organizer G1 belongs to Godzilla. Other creatures can't control it. Put out the fire. What's happening? It's trying to become another Godzilla. How ironic! It was brought back to life by Godzilla, then destroyed by Godzilla. Yes. Godzilla's coming! Get away! Escape! Everybody, escape! Katagiri! Get out of here! I'm seeing in this close for the first time. - Escape! - No! Come on! Godzilla! Katagiri! Science progressing in the wrong way produced Godzilla. Why do you appear before us? It was us human beings who made the monster. Godzilla is in ourselves, in everybody's mind.
