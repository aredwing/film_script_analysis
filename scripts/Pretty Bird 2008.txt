I've, uh, I've, uh, worked in the aerospace industry for 20 years, so... [chuckles] truly? Mmm. [Curtis]: Nice. Well, I, uh... ...Am kind of a buff, too, So science-wise that puts us on the same page. Did you study engineering somewhere? Where? Do you know that 90 percent of the population Doesn't understand creative types? Artists, inventors... ...Scientists. Like that English fella in the wheelchair, You think he's got any friends? - Who, Stephen hawking? - He doesn't. I mean, sure, people kiss his ass... ...But they're not his friends.

Maybe it's time for you to step out front. Hmm? [knock on door] - This is weird. - [laughs] Well, it won't be for much longer, ok? Well, hello. We so welcome you. Richard Honeycutt, Kenny Owenby. - Yeah. - [bell dings] Ooh! Biscotti. We've got, uh... Name cards. Kenny, music. Hey! Hey, come here. Yeah. Hello, hello. Look who was hiding from me. - Rolf, this is Rick. - [Curtis]: Kenny, please? Do you have any pets, Rick? I'm married. - [snaps fingers] - Kenny! Please? [whispers] sorry. Tonight I present to you a dream. A dream, born in the dark of a movie theater, When first the world heard these immortal words. "shaken, not stirred." [men clamoring] [gunshots] [mimicking whooshing] Most people think that rocket belts And greatness exist only in Hollywood, In a fantasy place, or some... ...Future world. But to you, gathered here tonight, Let me officially say... Screw the future... ...'cause I have it. [grumbles] mm-hm. [exhales] Hydrogen peroxide-propelled personal rocket device. [Curtis]: The rocket belt. You know about this thing? I'm a rocket scientist, man. Curtis? Did you hear that? He just said he knows all about this. Where'd you get these blueprints, Curtis? The library, the public library. Kenny, please. We're starting a company, Rick, That is going to change the way people think About a lot of things. Yeah, well, that's great and all, Curtis, But you know people have been trying to do this for years. [chuckles] what makes you think it's gonna be any different now? That's a good point, and it's exactly that kind of attitude That has guaranteed they wouldn't make it. I mean, how do you think a company like Boeing got started? "gee, I don't know, Curtis, how did Boeing get started?" I don't know, but they sure as hell didn't do it By sitting around on their duffs, scared to take a Chance. Don't you at least want to give it a try, Rick? [Curtis]: Ok, essentials. Let's see, little blinking lights, glowing dials, You know, machines. Everything should glow, So we can work in the dark if we had to. - [snorts] - Rick, look. - Twins. - And over here is gonna be an office with windows And posters, inspiring posters. I'm gonna need a lot more counter space... - Kenny, be writing this down. - "counter space." [Rick]: A lot more counter space. - From now on it's called r & d. - [Kenny]: Oh, perfect. - Research and development. - Mm-hmm. Ok, so, uh, counter space. What else? [Rick]: Magnifying lamps, lab supplies: Plastics molding machine, parts supplier, Bulk hydrogen peroxide. What are we using for accelerant here? Fine, fine, whatever that means. Kenny? - It's gonna be expensive. - Kenny, write that down. And we are going to need corporate credit cards for everyone. Got it. Rick, could you not do that, please? - Hey, I'm not finished here. - Leaving a message. Kenny? - Uh, magnifying... - Wait. Uh, R&D supply list. - Magnifying lamps. - Magnifying lamps. - Lab supplies. - Lab supplies. - Accelerant, whatever that means. - Some kind of accelerant... - You sure we got money for all this? - Kenny? - Uh, blinking lights. - Blinking lights. Uh... Glowing dials, inspiring posters. - Metal shelving. - Metal shelving. - Metal shelving. - Slop sink. - [Kenny]: Slop sink. - Slop sink. [Rick]: General cleaning supplies. - Uh, cleaning supplies. - [Rick]: A distillation setup. Distillation setup. [Rick and Kenny continue, overlapping] - [Kenny]: Mechanical cleaner. - [Curtis]: Mechanical cleaner. [Rick]: You guys got tool belts? [man]: Looking good. Looking pretty good, fellas. Got your seed money, got your space. You want to set up this lab that you're talking about. - You got your potential investors. - Of course. You know, I've known Kenny for a long time now. He'll tell you every startup, there's risks involved. But therein lies the potential To make a substantial amount of money. - [Kenny taps desk] - knock on wood. - [Rick]: Fantastic, huh? - [Kenny]: What is? It's the name of the company. Fantastic technologies, incorporated. It's classy but with a little bit sci-fi. [Kenny]: Curtis, that's genius. [humming] [Curtis]: Good morning, good morning. And good morning. At fantastic technologies We don't think fantastic is so crazy. [clears throat] at fantastic technologies We don't think fantastic is so crazy. Right from the outset our sights are set For out of the ordinary. Out of the or... [clears throat] [slide projector whirs] Right from the outset our sights are set On out of the ordinary. [humming] Morning, morning, morning. Morning voice. At fantastic technologies We don't think fantastic is so crazy. You can guarantee the first thing we think Will already be outside the box. Maybe you said to yourself, "that's a crazy idea. I must be insane." not at fantastic tech you're not. We applaud risky thinking. Taking chances. But only the ones backed by hard science. It's not just a rocket belt... ...It's an attitude. [doors closing] Yaah! Did I scare you? [chuckling] No. Oh, my God, I am pooped. But luckily, stopped by the old bookstore on the way home And I found this. Picked up a copy for everybody. Wow. "the spring in your step: Motivational wit and wisdom." [Curtis]: I know, good stuff, right? Mmm. Yeah. Thanks a lot. Any investors at the bookstore, chief? Well, you don't want to put the old cart before the horse, do you? Hmm. [chuckles] You need any help? - No. - Excelente! [Curtis groans] - Ah! - [grunts] Listen to this one. Rick, listen to this one. "anyone can steer a ship in calm seas." Hmm. Hey, here's an interesting one. "don't remove a fly from your friend's head with a hatchet." Oh, look here, it says that's a Chinese proverb. - So don't use a hatchet. - Well, yeah, not for a fly. They're saying don't use the wrong tools for the job. - [stifled chuckle] - "bite off more than you can chew, And then chew... ...It." "bite off more than you can chew and then chew it." "plan more than you can do and then do it." That's a good rhyming one there. What's the deal with his legs? - What do you mean? - His legs. They just kind of dangle around. It doesn't look like he's flying. It doesn't look very cool. Could you do something else with his legs? Mmm. Can his legs do anything cooler? Can we retract 'em? Uh, human legs don't retract. Oh, I got it. What if he does 'em like he's doing a judo kick? You guys affiliated with NASA? How do you mean "affiliated"? Yeah, I don't know. Got anything else? [%% Leo Delibes: Ou va la jeune indoue ] [Curtis]: So big business dinner tonight? Yeah, uh, viper technologies. What do you know about these guys? You heard of 'em before? No, but I'm sure they're great, you know. Probably some, uh, venture capitalists. Capitalists, huh? Awesome. Hey, uh, Curtis. There's, um, something else that's awesome. What's that, Kenny? Opera. Live opera. It's, uh, downtown, near tons of restaurants And great bistros. And, uh, you know, you've been working so hard lately. - You deserve a night to chill out. - [Curtis]: Is it in English? Actually, that's the fun part 'cause they provide you with your own program with the words on it, And you just follow right along, so... Do you guys need me to leave? - Are you talking business? - Oh. No, no, no. No. We're, uh, we're talking opera. - Curtis has never been. - I've never been either, But Kenny says it's really neat. Oh, well, then we should all go sometime. While we're on the subject, Mandy, um... ...I have got a business dinner tonight. And... [sighs] Would you want to go with me and... And... ...Talk and... What's the name of the place called, Kenny? Il villaggio. Oh, that's supposed to be a really nice restaurant. I wanted to ask you before, but I felt shy. Why so confident now? - No reason. - Liar. - I would love to go. - Great. Ok, wish me luck. I'll tell you how it goes. Good luck. I love music... And movies. Uh, of course, I'm a bit eccentric. You don't have to beat yourself up. I love movies too. This wine is delicious. Goes very well with the potatoes And the filet mignon. - Agreed. - [Mandy]: Yeah. So, what kind of movies do you like? Mostly old ones. Classics, I guess. - I love classics. - Yeah? So, what's the favorite? Which one changed your life? Oh, um... Let me see. Changed my life? - Um, that's a hard one. - [Curtis laughs] Um... I would probably have to say the exorcist. - Wow. - Yeah. The way the mother stood by her daughter All through when the devil was possessing her. - Oh, I know. I love that part. - Yeah. I... I remember it so vividly. Um... Shane, my son, he got a stomach virus The first time that I saw that movie. He was vomiting for two days. It was just... It was awful. Poor little guy. This was when I shared custody with my former husband, And it was his weekend. So I... I was there in the car, just... ...Sort of bundling my son, And he's getting sick in this bucket I brought And he's crying his little eyes out. And then I thought, bam! The exorcist. And I looked in the rearview mirror of that car And I said, "Mandy riddle... ...If the mother in that exorcist can keep it together, While satan himself is making a mess inside that little girl, You can get through this." So... You know what we did? We grabbed that bucket And marched right back in the house. [Curtis]: Wow. You saw a lesson there That probably No one else ever saw. [man]: Fantastic technologies! - [Curtis]: Chuck! - [laughs] did I scare you? - You're viper technologies? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet I'm the last Guy you expected to see tonight. No! Not the last. No! No. No, no, no. Yeah. Chuck and I did some business A couple, a few... Three, four years back? - I'm chuck stutters. - Hi. And anything you heard... ...Well, hell, it's probably true. Uh, Mandy, uh, Ms. Riddle is our director of marketing. Ohh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! I apologize. Excuse me. - No need. - Ooh. Let me get a drink. [whistling] Garcon. [chuck sighs] Fantastic technologies. Well, Curtis does have a fantastic knack For screwing things up. Wow. Ok, just because an idea doesn't work Doesn't mean it's anybody's fault. Look at that, always on the bright side, isn't he? Just relax. Come on. I'm playing with you! - [groans] - [both chuckle] I read the prospectus, I like the idea. What, are you kidding me? A rocket belt. Wow! Count me in. Seriously? [%% Leo Delibes: Ou va la jeune indoue ] [engine pops, hissing] Shit! [winces] Damn it. [sighs] - [door closes] - ow! [both laughing] I nearly died when you said director of marketing. [Curtis chuckles] I've never been director of anything in my life. You are insane, Curtis Prentiss. [chuckles] Shane? What are you doing up? Go upstairs and wait with Grammy. [chuckles] I'm sorry, Curtis. For the life of me I can't remember If the magazine said I'm supposed to act like I don't want you to come in Or act like I do. I don't know. [laughs] I mean, that's just one of those, you know, calls that... You know, judgment things. - Um... - Uh... I think maybe you should leave. I'm starting to feel like I wanna take my pants off. Oh, my God. Ok. - I'll... I'll see you tomorrow. - Ok. [Curtis]: Good night! [car engine revving] I don't give a shit about Robin Williams. I'm just saying he's a good actor. Curtis, we have a problem. Before you say anything, let me just tell you this: You are doing an extremely good job. Now go. Ok. These blueprints here are incomplete. What are you talking about? Look, here. There is no diagram for this last part here. Very important valve. It's missing. So there's no directions, Then I'm gonna have to make this thing from scratch. - Ok, so? - There are no blueprints, Curtis. I'm... How the hell am I supposed to know - What it is I'm doing? - Blueprints this, Blueprints that. It's like all I'm hearing lately. Because there's nothing else that matters, you idiot! - I would be done by now. - Rick, look, look, look, We are inventors, right? We invent! I'm sorry, but that's what we do. Oh, man. Who the hell am I kidding? Jesus Christ. All right, just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Look at it. Look at it like this. It's like this. It's like... All right, now, uh... All right, what was the name of the guy who invented the nuclear bomb? Curtis... [chuckles] - Just, come on... - No, I don't have time for this shit. All right. I know you know. Just tell me who was it. Oppenheimer. Right. Now, let's... Let's just suppose this Oppenheimer, He's, uh, he's having a day like today. He's frustrated, right? And all the other scientists come in, And they're like, "hey, Oppenheimer, Retard, haven't you heard? It's impossible to build a nuclear bomb. Can't be done, you're wasting your time." Now let's just imagine If this Oppenheimer believed them. If he said to himself, "you know what? They're right. This bomb's too hard to invent. I'm done. Can't do it." Now you tell me, Rick, where would we be today? [scoffs] Now you see what I'm saying. But he did not give in to that negativity, Thank God, and neither can we. [woman]: What are you doing, babe? [Rick]: Oh, nothin'. Nothin'. What are you doing? [woman]: I'm about to make dinner. You gonna be home? Uh... No, I'm probably gonna be here late. I'll see you later, babe, all right? [%% Wim Mertens: Iris ] Well, there you are, you vicious little bitch. [generators whirring] [rocket pack whirring] [Rick grunts] [laughs] whoo! [Rick laughs] [Curtis]: Inside all matter in the universe, There is more space between atoms Than atoms themselves. Hi, I'm curt Prentiss, and I'm gonna level with you. I'm not a scientist, But I am a doctor of sorts. - What is this? - And my specialty is people. At Prentiss industries we believe in taking the space Left by those atoms And filling it with respect. [knock on door] Hey, Rick, what's the problem? I mean, uh, come on in. [Curtis groans] You want a hot pocket? What you got there? [chuckling] What's that? Oh, yeah... No, uh... Yeah. I caught your little TV commercial. Prentiss industries. [nervous chuckle] Sorry, what's that? I couldn't hear you. Well, I don't know, you're the genius. - Why don't you tell me? - Thank you. Thank you. I am a genius, And I will tell you... I noticed that my name is not listed Anywhere on your little pamphlet here. I did not build this thing So that you could shove me out of the way - And take all the credit. - I don't appreciate you poking around my office. I don't appreciate you Trying to push me into the shadows, asswipe. May I see that, please? - This? - [Curtis]: Yes. Sure. See? May I hold it, please? No, you may not hold it, please. Well, boy! Whoo! Nothing gets by you, Dr. Sherlock Holmes! I built that belt. Ok. [scoffs] fine. [laughs] fine! Fine. You gonna market it too? Huh? Are you gonna show up for meetings And spit fingernails on the floor and call everybody stupid? Are you gonna charm people into giving you a million dollars? Bring goliath to his knees? [chuckles] holy cow! I must be a comedian 'cause that's a total joke! No, you know what? You actin' like a scientist Is the fuckin' joke, asshole. - Ok, you're right! - [chuckles] Maybe I don't know all the science stuff, Maybe I didn't go to a very good college... Hey, Curtis, wake up, man! You didn't go to any fuckin' college! Of course I didn't because what I've got you can't teach! People love me. That's my genius! And I'll give you a thousand dollars, jerk, If you can name one person who loves you! I have had marketing jerks like you... ...Stealing my ideas for 20 fuckin' years. And that is over. Now, I am... I am... I am dead fuckin' serious, Curtis. You make no more decisions without checking with me first. You read me? Do you fuckin' read me? Because I am done with screwin' around! Ok, you want me to promise you something? You gotta promise me something too. - What, Curtis? - You can't call me dumb. - What? - Don't call me dumb. Not around you or me, especially Kenny. - No "dumb." - I don't give a shit about Kenny. Maybe you oughta start caring about him. And you keep belittling people, he's gonna lose confidence in me, And the second he does that, then there goes the money. All you gotta do is treat me with a little bit of respect... ...And finish the belt. - Finish the belt, huh? - Finish the belt! I did. An hour ago. [birds chirping, singing in distance] Randy, I want to introduce you To our colleague, Kenny Owenby. - We spoke on the phone. - [Randy]: Yeah. Fantastic technologies. How do you like that? We love it. [chuckles] [clears throat] Ok, so you're gonna want to just feather that throttle. Not much more, 'cause I got it dialed in real sensitive, so don't lean into it. Don't worry about a thing. I've flown a couple of these before. [laughs] no, you haven't. 'cause it's my belt, And you have never flown my belt. Understood? Shithead. I'll give you the thumbs-up, all right? What the hell are you wearing that for, man? Here we go!

You have an entertaining presentation... ...But we're gonna need a little more science than that. [whispers] ok. You know, I'm sorry, this reminds me of a movie that I saw once, A movie that, I don't know, pretty much changed my life. Maybe you've heard of it. It's called the dead poets society, Starring the incomparable Robin Williams, - In his first serious role. - [bangs fist on table] And in it, he plays an embattled soccer coach Who tells his students, carpe diem. Which to me... ...Means never let the sun set on your dreams. Good day. Ok, wow, sure thing. Yeah. [%% Wim Mertens: 4 mains ] Oh, that'll work. Wow! Well, I enjoyed meeting you, too. [air brush hissing] Hey! [chuckles] Fuck. [sighs] [clears throat] - What? - [Curtis]: Morning. What are you doing here? What are you, uh... What are you doing here? - You wanna give me a hand? - No. Suit yourself. [door slams] [sighs] You know, you can go home if you want. You know, take the day off. We got things under control here. What, I bust my ass and then leave you in charge? No. I'm, uh, I'm fine staying right here. Wow! Rick? I am officially giving you the day off. Tonya probably hasn't seen you in... Shut up. Don't tell me what to do. The belt is finished, Rick. [chuckles] really? What are you, Chuck Yeager? You don't know anything. [whistles] [door opens, slams] [Curtis]: Rick, I don't want to sound like a know-it-all, But do you know what it means to undermine synergy? Go fuck yourself. Oh, for Christ's sake. Jesus Christ. Curtis, what the hell do you...? Shh! [shushing] Easy on the language there, partner. Come on, you guys. [chuck]: Go ahead. The cursin'. We got some money guys here, I don't wanna freak 'em out. Nice place you got here, chuck. Yeah. Feel free. Go ahead, look around. Hey, uh, fella, you wanna do me a favor and tell your boss I'm here? [groans] Who the hell are you, fella? Hey, pal, just calm down. Where's Prentiss? Did you just tell me to calm down? Listen, fella, why don't you go run and tell your boss - He's gotta come out here and talk to me. - My boss? Who the fuck are you? I might just be a major fuckin' partner in this goddamn business. I already warned you once about the swears. - Got something here, chuck? - Yeah! - That's Curt's rocket belt. - Ho, ho! Ho! No! Don't you even touch that! That is not yours! Stay away from that. Everybody get the hell out of here now! Forget this, fellas. Come on. We're leavin'. Yeah, right. Ten mattresses, For a three-bedroom house. - I don't... It doesn't make sense. - [laughs] In one day. What do you do with ten mattresses - In a one-bedroom house? - He's lying to us, Kenny! Kenny! He is lying to us! He's trying to push us out And he is trying to take everything! Kenny, we are getting it right in here. Right here. - Right here, you understand? - Rick... We're getting it right up in here, Kenny. You and me are getting screwed. Kenny. Kenny, do me a favor And ask your little friend over here If he made a deal with some guy named chuck? Chuck, who just now waltzed into R&D Like he owned the goddamn place. Curtis, do you know a chuck? Somebody who's... Come on, you ask... You ask stupid here If, uh, he's been off making side deals And throwing money away this whole time That your store has been going straight down the tubes? - What about the store? - Ok, fine, excuse me. Kenny, will you please ask Rick If he recalls a certain promise he made - About the nature of... - Just admit it, Curtis! - ...Our interpersonal business relationship... - Just say it! You've been making deals without us! - Ok, fine, excuse me. - No more trying to push me into the shadows. Excuse me, but I am the president of this company And I will run it in whatever fashion I choose. And I caught him sneaking around behind our backs And painting the fuckin' rocket belt without telling anybody! [Kenny]: Well... I knew he was gonna paint it. - What do you mean you knew? - [Kenny]: He told me. I consulted him on the colors he had in mind. [scoffs] [exhales] [groans] so you two cock-knockers are, uh, Out pickin' colors and you're paintin', And never even thinking to check with me About any goddamn thing that's going on? Richard, it's all in your mind. No one's out to get you. You are freakin' out about stuff That doesn't even exist. [whispers] it's fine. It's fine. Aah! - [man]: You're gonna sue 'em? - Yeah, a lawsuit. That's what I said. [man]: For what, though? What's it gonna say? I don't know, Carl. Uh... I don't know, just put, uh, For ownership of said rocket belt And, uh, I don't know, uh... For ownership and a bunch of fuckin' money. [Carl]: What's his name? Prentiss, right? [woman on TV]: ...As the Cincinnati archdiocese... [Rick]: I'm gonna sue him for a million dollars. How's that? A million dollars and the belt. That's enough, right, you think? [woman on TV]: ...Telling savers to stay out of the... Technology stocks extended their gains... [Curtis]: People may doubt what you say But they'll believe what you do. The rocket belt works. I mean, the thing works, so pretty soon we'll be fine. [man]: With this investment I would just... I'd just advise some caution, you know. I am being cautious. That's why I need the loan. [man]: I'm looking at the accounts and it, um, Looks like we're in a pretty heavy downward trend here. You know, numbers won't tell you everything. I can't give you a loan, Kenny. I mean, you just lost a substantial amount of money. Not lost, Ted. Invested. [Ted]: These partners of yours, you, uh... You know 'em, you trust 'em, right? Ted, they're my best friends. [woman on TV]: April 15 falls on a Sunday. You have an extra day to get your taxes in order... [Curtis]: Every day, millions of people die. You know, they work some dumb job Their whole life and then they die. Just gone, Like when you shake an etch-a-sketch. That's bullshit. [lights hum overhead] [door opens] Hi, Rick. What are you doing here? Where is it? Curtis, where's the belt? Where is the belt, Curtis? Where's the belt, Curtis? Where is it... ...Shit for brains? Where's what, Rick? Where's the belt, Curtis? - You seem really upset. - Curtis... You better tell me where that rocket belt is Or this whole deal is gonna go south real fast. Everything you're saying sounds very important, But I'm late for a meeting right now. Thanks. I'm gonna get that belt either way, Curtis. [door opens] [Rick]: Good God, woman! I designed it. - I built it. - Mm-hmm. With my own goddamn hands I built that thing. So I'm... I'm sorry. You've gotta draw a line somewhere. - [chamber spins] - [exhales] Richard, please. Now that's the sound of freedom right there. Don't you worry about me. Is that what it is?
