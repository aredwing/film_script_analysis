Meanwhile, let me introduce you to the protagonists of this tale' This is... ...Rawna Rawnojoy Mitter. The only son of the Miners of Mirrorsville. Tch! This is not a test of skill! It's child's play! So what do you want instead? To blow off each child's head? A sharp shooter... ...but not interested in guns! This young man's only interest is music! The heroine - Julie Zulekha Khan Beloved daughter of the Khans of Mirrorsville But, Good Lord! What is she up to, this child from a conservative Muslim home? And this woman with her... ...is her nurse Fatema Been looking after her since childhood. Some looking after, this! But wait! There are more players here 2 kings! Here is King no 1 Name? Bishwanath Mitter Occupation? Real estate. Plus...underhand dealings in drugs Fortune favours the bold! Sabir Khan Owner of Khan Constructions Ltd. King no 2! Reputed Muslim family. But his goons too, are involved in underhand drug deals Above all, Sabir Khan is the prime enemy of Bishu Mitten Both have their sights fixed on Mirrorsville slum. Both wish to tear down the slum & build highrises At present, the slum-dwellers are fed up of their constant fights! Come, listen for yourselves - Hey Manik! Another round of cha! Gang wars will start in about an hour! Really, it's getting too much! It's a theatre, not hutments as such. From morning to night we have drama! Careful now! That's a sharp new blade! Brawling all morning, can one keep one's head? What is it today? - Who can say! Godforsaken fellows.. ...love stepping on each other's toes! They'll drive us out from here, God knows! Both demand cuts! What the hell, I say! Just paid off one; the other turns up today! This simply can't go on! They'll soon be dead and gone! Knife one another & be done! Like an the shindy yesterday... ...almost at death's door Sunny lay! You see that Tayeb Bro? See how they bully the poor? Where is it? Who? Who else but those louts Sunny & Pappu! Let's go check it out! What's going on here? Ah! You here too? You & that cheat there make a fine pair! Shut up you piece of shit! It's me who's in for it! 80 bucks lost before any sale! You cheat on weight at every turn of scale! Short of cash? I'll be damned! Now scram! We have to taste the fruit before we buy! I took just one bite. Awful stuff! So why' '80 bucks? You bloody cheat! What precious ower are you, my sweet? Go quietly about your business If not' If not 'what? Again! Who asked you to pitch in, you smut? - Enough! Now quiet, everyone! What do you think you're up to, son of a gun? Pick any poor man and slit his throat for fun? Come on Tayeb, don't lose your cool so fast! Mess with me, buddy' you breathe your last! You make my blood boil, you pieces of slime! From before our fathers' time you've run us down... ...without reason or rhyme! Yet you are mere Mitters, while we are Khans sublime! Yes? Hello? We're descendants of Bahadur Shah The Great! Ah! Now we've got it straight! Not Shahrukh, nor Salman, & yet he is a Khan! Your dad was a refugee, surname Akhtar! Half crazy, bleary eyed, a Unani doctor. How come you suddenly turned Khan? Who's your real father now? Are you your Uncle's son? I swear to God, your life is over & done! If life is done, it's done Be it knife we face, or gun Come up if you dare In a trice we'll slice you bare In a trice we'll end your run! At night in Mirrorsville prowl hunters out to kill No one knows when day will dawn on Mirrorsvillel Mirrorsvillel Mirrorsvillel At night in Mirrorsville all roads the mist will fill Who knows when light will break on Mirrorsville? Mirrorsvillel Mirrorsvillel If life is done, it's done Be it knife we face, or gun Come up if you dare In a trice we'll slice you bare In a trice we'll end your run! Mirrorsvillel Mirrorsvillel Mirrorsvillel Mirrorsvillel Ah! Here at last on the scene! What do you mean? When we came, just 4 years old was Tabbu You brought him up He thinks of you as 'Abbu' He's like your son. Hotheaded? Perhaps yes.. 'But fought for you & landed in a mess. If you don't bail him out tomorrow' You should have told us long ago a nephew's a far cry! Why, a sister, if a widow... is not welcome any more! What're you saying Sister! You know well... ...Tabbu's hot temper is impossible to quell! I've tried to reason with him in vain! Grandma, you explain Look Sabir, who else is there for a woman... ...but father, husband or brother? Tell me then' ...if Julie were in trouble, God forbid... ...could you rest until you came to her aid? Shh my child, shh! You're responsible for him, his guardian! Go find a way to get him out of prison! Easy for the old woman to say! But, the person needed for that' 'is a most dangerous one! 'Is a most dangerous one! Not King, nor Knave... ...an Ace! Tayeb will surely kill me one day! My image is tattered, my reputation at stake! Lost his father early. Now a spoilt brat! Can't control his temper, that's what. Sabir Saab, must loving care make a monkey of a lad? Then what's the use of culture, tell me that? But Tayeb isn't really a bad sort At this age their heads just get too hot! Isn't the Police Commissioner your friend'? That fellow Tayeb knifed, is he on the mend? Not come to yet. It was deep, the wound! 'What's his name again? Think they call him Sunny' Tayeb needs a lesson, I know that better than any' I'll teach him good & proper' First pray to Allah Miya... ...that Sunny survives! If not, I greatly fear... ...that Tayeb will be charged with murder And your image tarnished further! True, I could ask the Commissioner if I' But hide any facts, &you deal with RTI (Right to Information)! I understand sir. 'With Elections ahead' ...one mis-step, & you're as good as dead! These are mere tries anyhow. Okay, I'll take your leave now. Oh! Do call us if you need anything... 'before the Elections we mean! Come now, Sabir Saab your business is mine too! Let me see what I can do' Friendship is above any law after all! Hey you! Give the Commissioner a call. If it hadn't been for Grandma, I'd prefer for Tayeb to stay in the stir. A real taste of prison.. 'Would soon make him see reason! True But Tayeb has his uses too. By the way, Manmohan still won't sell Even doubling our price didn't jell. Says the house holds memories of his mother! But sell he must, or we're in lather! Oh go on, Mirza Saab'.! If the price is right, anyone will sell! Not always for money! Well' 'guess you'll know when you're as old as me So think of some other strategy! Surely Manmohan has some weak spot? Send someone to find out what! Who would you say? Who... Okay! Okay! Send Tayeb if there's no other way. Inside my heart a highway There you race your jeep I dare you to stop when you reach my parched lips Inside my heart a highway There you race your jeep I dare you to stop when you reach my parched lips Water, fire, earth or sky - nothing do I fear Place your hand in mine & see where we go from here My reckless heart is ready to dare All for your love...

By Allah's blessings and your good will... ...the going has been great. But it's made me grayer still! Time's on your side now - a racehorse unstoppable!

Were it to happen so... ...that all scenes with your magic glow May this world dwell within my heart... 'where every part is you! Just heard they've beaten up a guy from the slum He's in the hospital, poor bum! These are their scare tactics... ...to clear Mirrorsville slum And we? We just sit & watch? Let the Miners wield the stick? Don't worry so much Sabir We Khans have our own technique! Hey! Hey! Hey! Moving around openly, these kids! What if someone were to see? Tayeb bhai? Tabbu! Here in this room? You...? Who'who's this one? Bishu Mitter's son!!! Fate's decree...indelible... overwrite...my Master Tell you something Rawno? Get out of here. This business, all this fighting it's not for you my dear. Get out of here! Remember Uncle Bunty? Lives in Mumbai...? He's very fond of you. Shall I ask him to try? Make music your career... ...come home sometimes to me. After you make good... ...get married... ...to someone you love truly. Don't listen to what others say... ...or you'll live to rue the day! You have only one life Live it your own way! Tell me Aunt... ...Christians & Hindus can marry. So can Hindu and Sikh But if it's Hindu-Muslim the marriage won't stick? What? Rot! Get such ideas out of your head! In our faith it's forbidden. It's forbidden today... ...as it was forbidden then 'Then' meaning? When? A few years before my marriage maybe' I had a friend called Madhu.. ...from a Hindu family. Probably quite a bit younger than me. Daadijaan's brother's house in Lucknow...? We went there in winter you know' This friend of mine lived next door. Your Abbujaan' 'was crazy about her! She too, was undone! Madhu"! It's an old story... ...but look at the turn of life - Madhu lives here now... ...as Bishu Mitter's wife! Keep it loose, see...? Let go, or he'll cut free! Cut him down! Yippee! 'Will you marry me? I will. What about your Abbu & Ammi? Tomorrow, I'll tell my father clearly' 'you're the only one I'll ever marry My father cannot bear to see his daughter in despair She must always be happy & carefree! What makes her happy then? Only when 'yours truly' is in her ken? And then? Ammi! Sent all my shirts to the laundry at one go? Was it essential to do so? Not a single good one left! What am I to wear? Go find me something, I'm going out in half an hour! So you needed her right now? I see! How nicely she was oiling my hair! You ruined it with your yelling, you bear! You're the only one to go out? Not me? So? I'll take over the oiling now' Stop it! What d'you know of oil massages anyhow! Really? So who does? Rawno, your lover boy? 'Who-who's Rawno? Wh-who's Rawno? Stop acting coy! I know what you're up to, each & every ploy! What you do, where you meet... I know everything! Bunking college & having a great ing! What are you thinking? When you'll meet & tell? Keep one thing in mind he's a Hindu! Infidel! More important than that he's a Mitter! They're our sworn enemies! It would be a slur' But no way will I marry that Parvez! I would rather die! I'm telling you straight. Really? So whose wife will you be, my pretty one? No one's at all. She'll live alone, will Zuleika Khan. That's for the best. Remain alone...here in this house' ...right here until you die I'll look after you always' Stay here, under my eye Your dad and my mom? It's got to be a joke! Your mom and my aunt were friends! That's how it broke! And then? They dreamed many dreams the two of them! The families may have met to talk things over' Must have gone pretty far! If the girl embraces Islam, I have no problem. But can she? It would still be a problem for me! A girl who can forswear her own religious vows' ...how can she be true to her love & her spouse? I tell you straight, if a kafir enters here' She won't, never fear! I'd much rather get out of here! If they wish me to convert, I shall Why just religion, for you I'll give up all But' But what? I'm thinking of my father. Such a strict Hindu! He'll be devastated if I eschew' I don't want that either, Madhu' What're you trying to say? We'll have to elope somewhere - far, far away! But where? Mumbai. My Uncle Bunty has lived there for years We'll live with them at first till I start my career I'll be a famous playback singer in no time you'll see! It won't always be like this on top of the world we'll be! So? 'Will you elope with me, Khan? I will Rawno, You are my jaan (life) You will do no such thing! If you still do... ...I swear on your dead mother, I'll hound out you two! And with my own hands I'll kill you. He won't escape either' And after I've killed you both, I'll kill myself too. Father! Listen Khan.. ...suppose we stay as paying guests somewhere? Or may be...at a cramped shanty somewhere? As long as we're together, I really don't care. But wait! 'Will you find work in Mumbai? You're not a graduate yet! Hang graduation! Remember that Club night? Rawna's magic? How that one song took ight? If nothing else, I'll join a band. They do well there, I believe I could get Montey over, and' 'he'd be lyricist, lead singer me, Chiku with his drums' that's three' Great! What about me? I'd be out? All of you in? Why out? You too will sing! No worries, mate! Fusion is in! Hmm Where will we live there? Imagine' a little room somewhere' Hmm' 'a little room I see' 'a little room I see' So-so-do-re-mi-mi Cheaply, but together; we'd make it quite pretty We can live in a low-rent room, a cramped little shanty Take showers in time-bound water, perfectly dandy!

Wait and see' We'll turn Mumbai into Switzerland, with ease! A little room I see' So so do re mi mi! We'll make it so pretty! I can cook a little, will you say 'third rate'? If lunch consists of noodles and dinner is omelette? - Super! My mouth is watering already! For power cuts at dinner we'll have candles ready The Arabian Sea is calling me' Let's start packing now! The two of us will hit it off somewhere, somehow' We'll cut down on costs' But our mood will be regal! We'll shop in the evening after a full-day's rehearsal Two hearts... overowing... ...in a cramped little shanty' Oh no! Not a shanty any more! A little room I see' So so do re mi mi We'll make it so pretty We'll play it musically A little room I see' A little room I see' So so do re mi!mi It'll be oh so pretty! A little room I see' It'll be oh so pretty! I'd closed off! And I was dreaming' 'that my Reshmabai International Puppet Theatre... ...had become very famous We were getting calls from all over! And along with that... ...money! But all these are just daydreams! D reams... How sweet they are, these dreams.. ...aren't they? But dreams are all they are' Reality is playing complex games elsewhere! Come, let's take a look! It's a game of percentage, bro... It's a game of percentage, bro... ...a game of percentage!

Think it over, there's no hurry Here, keep my card. Just a phone call, no need to worry. The school teacher said Raju is the best Be it annual exams or a class test But what can we do to help him get ahead? He helps you with your tea-shop instead! Just stop to consider' 'how much money we'll get if we accept their offer! You can afford an assistant... Raju can go to an English medium school! Surely you can do this for your son! Ruin his life? Don't be a fool! What is there to think about so much? I'm not the only one! Have to consider the others too! When have the others thought of you? If they got such an offer... ...wouldn't they grab it too? Feel like studying in an English medium school? Hey kafir! Arshinagar is going! What d'you plan on doing? Nothing... If Arshinagar goes... ...your temple's no use! No more ringing of that bell! Who says so, tell? Good Lord!! 'What's in your head? Cow dung or grass? The slum will be razed to build highrises!
