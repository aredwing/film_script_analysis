[ System Alert ] Alert! Incoming storm. [ System Alert ] Alert! Incoming storm. We've got an emergency situation, in coming meteor shower. Its a rouge meteor shower. - We're just picking it up now. - How come we didn't get any indication of this. - I'm in the dark as much as you are. - That... that's not good enough... Give me a damage report. Decompression in our outer supply's building. It looks like our second escape pod took a hit. What the hell? Madsen? Do you read over? Communications dead. [ System Text ] - Malfunction. Filtration Unit 09. Shit! [ System Alert ] Emergency Alert Crew to active stations. [ System Alert ] Emergency Alert Crew to active stations. Hey Jones come on, hey wake up! Wake up Come on! We've got a situation! No shake a god damn leg and get up! Power outage in bays one and two. Powers dropping. This is Commander Gerald Braunchman, Moon-base ARK. Official request, code 9. Immediately evacuation of all crew to Earth. I repeat, we have a situation up here. Immediate request of shuttle launch. Evacuation of all crew members to Earth. [ System Alert ] Oxygen filter failure in bay three level 4 and rising. - What the hell happened to levels one to three? - We got hit by A meteor storm communications down. We're loosing power, we're on emergency back up We lost an escape pod. - Looks like thermal controls been hit. - Damage to both solar panels. Somebody turn that thing off. Handing Over. Run Ops, see if you can get us back on line with ground control. Copy That. Stranded 2013. I can't breathe. Come here. Jeez. Bruce, check oxygen back up! - John, you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. [ System Alert ] Back up systems on line. Limited function available. Oxygen stabilizing. That meteor ripped a hole through... The roof of Bay Three. Carbon monoxide filtrations been hit. Johns, get down there! We need to seal of that aria. And fast Its leaking poison throughout this Station. Take a welding kit seal of the air lock. On It. - I'll go. - No, No you can't... I did the last CVL I'll be fine. All right, close every hatch and Bay as you enter., Other wise you could start a chain reaction, decompression could blow us all to hell. Well so no pressure, then. Doc, I need you to get down to the fuel cell. See if you can buy us more time by activating the emergency filtration pumps. I'm on It. Ready, Cameron? Ready. When I opened the door the air lock, there's gonna be a tone of debris and compressed carbon monoxide. Suit up as fast as possible. Done it. Cameron, do you copy? Over! All EVA suits have been destroyed except for one. Its a bit burned, its fine. It's too risky. Cameron, the smallest tare in the EVA you get sucked out into the vacuum. Shall we cancel the mission? I'm at air lock to Bay 3. Anti-gravity over ride on. Were running out of time. Let's go! No heroics, if it looks bad just abort. Hears hoping. I'm going in. I'm opening the air lock Then I'm handing control over to you. Yes, sir. Safe lock in the heat shield failed, now I'm jammed. Lock down failed! When we abort? That shit will be leaking into the station. Lock down on door two's holding. Proceed with the mission. Process the damage for me. Bay's holding. Carbon monoxide's of the charts. There been serious impact. Bay four must have been damage. Okay CO2 is an immediate concern. She's got to shut that thing down! We got to shut down that filtration unit and get you the hell out of there. Can you see what we've got here? Nothing we could not see anything, your on your own. Where's the meteor exactly? Its impeded in cylinder nine. Between that and the filter. The meteors lodged. Hang one, I'll try and leaver it out. Cameron? Come in! Cameron, do you hear me? I'm not going anywhere. I need you to guide me to the shut off valve. Its right underneath, Its right underneath. The valve should be right underneath to the right side. The valves damaged, we still got leakage. Carbon monoxide leakage is causing mayhem the units can't keep up. Were close to catastrophic collapse. Cameron, get out of there, do you hear me? Cameron! Cameron! Cameron, do you hear me? Cameron, do you copy? Come on, Lieutenant! I'm at airlock Bay 3. Get out of there, if you can't close the air lock, seal bay 2 door. Colonel, it is heating up. Bay 4's about to collapse. Christ, Cameron's still in there! There get your mask on! Good. Ava! Cameron! Now where are you? Over here. Hey hey, do you hear that? Are you okay? You wrench this and you head up I can crawl out from behind this. Lets lift this thing. Up! Come on come on, lets go. You okay? Thank god I thought we lost you. It's okay, It looks worse than it is. Come on! Wait. Bruce! You got to take a look at this. There's some kind of spores in it. Come on, you two, lets get out of here. The less of this crap, that leaks out of the station the better of we will be. OK go! Okay the seal is holding, that should prevent leakage into the living quarters. You put on quite a show for us. Thanks. Lieutenant, you've been exposed to chemicals Hit the showers. Lieutenant! Good job! You too. Hows it looking? Ah it's good to go. Close. 95% off the base is powered off, so... until we can get the emergency light back... we're gonna have to get use to working in the dark. This gives us only 72 hours. Mission control will follow standard emergency procedures. It'll take 92 hours to clear for an assent, Another 72 hrs to launch a rescue for us. So we have to buy some time. What about the escape pod? It only handles 2, not an option. We still got traces of gas leakage, carbon monoxide levels are abnormal. Doc! Johnson! CO is odorless its colorless its tasteless. Neurological signs of CO poisoning include hallucinations disorientation, headaches, gas gangrene visual disturbances and death. Great more good news. Solution? We stay vigilant. We keep a close eye on one another, if any one off you see's any one ells exhibiting any on of these symptoms... Report it to me immediately. Understood? Understand. Alright, I want to try and clear out as much of this carbon monoxide as we can... Opening the filtration devices that are still operational. Seal the airlock. [ System Alert ] Danger, air lock open. Okay that worked, good news. Carbon monoxide levels are at a minimum. Bad news, it drained more power from the fuel cells. How about repairing the solar panels? The suits are toast. Shit. We really are stranded. Johns, you're the engineer, figure something out. Maybe you can breathe in space. Lance, why don't you shut down the drilling rig, we're draining power from the vitals. All right I'm on it. I'll go. If doc can take a look at that meteor. There's some kind of spores attached. What are you talking about some kind of spore. That sounds like a foreign cotangent. That should go immediately into quarantined, none of us here get to play happy scientist. Our firs objective is to save are own asses. Do you understand? I'll deal with it. And listen I can't stress this enough. If any one of you starts felling confused or anything abnormal including mild auditory, or visual hallucination... You come see me immediately. Scientists! Drilling rigs going to sleep. Should reduce our power drain! Ava, can you come up here. You got to see this. You got it contained? Ye. Come and take a look at this. I've never seen anything like it, Some form of ancient cell structure, Its reproducing at an incredible rate. What? Got a sample there, why don't you run it through diagnostics see what you can find. This is Moon Base ARK, Colonel Brauchman to mission control, come in! Madsen? Are you there? Can you copy? Madsen? If you can hear me, Close down all mining work. Power is reduced to emergency lights only. Confirm rescue shuttle request. This is U.S Moon Base Ark, Colonel Brauchman to mission control, come in? She's ran three different diagnostics? All have identical results. Spores from the meteor can reproduce them self's without carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen. It seems exposure to light is what triggers them. Holly shit if this is what you say it is. We've just joined Banning Fleming and Edison. They can replicate, reproduce nutrients entirely by themselves. Like a bacterium? Only a hole lot smarter. Spores are essentially dormant codes, though no one knows what the replication of those spores will look like. I mean it could transmogrify it could mutate it could evolve. Evolve into what? But its the rate of growth that's absolutely extraordinary. I mean they're 100 times faster than any cells found in the human body. You okay? Yea. I'm just feeling a little nauseous I'm gonna go and lie down. - Hey. - Hey. Easy now, slowly. Where am I? Medical bay. Why are you all here wha... what's wrong? No! God no get it off. It's okay! What is it get it off me!!! Whats going on! Hey, just Relax! Son of a bitch! Johns, out in the hallway now. Okay, you okay! Whats it doing just look at me. Hay hay hay listen! You gotta breathe, breath for me. Slowly, just calm down just calm down. Okay. Shhh, I'm here. Okay. Ava, you got to listen to me now. OK? You have what appears to be a massively execrated pregnancy. Ava, okay, I can't explain it. I mean it can't be this fast. It can't be. Okay. What are they fighting about? Just Gerard is being a little cautious as usual, Be all right. We are going to get to the bottom of this I promise you. Don't worry about it, you've got to rest okay. Here lie-down. Okay. I'm gonna leave now. Oh don't go. I'll be right back, you're safe here, it's OK. He wants to put her in lock down. Lance, shes got to go into quarantined. You've got to back me up on this. Shes got some form of massive growth, Without power to the equipment I can't make a correct diagnosis. Do you and her... did you? Aw come on man, 6 months pregnant in 24 hours? Give me a fucking break. Shes got a reaction to chemical exposure, we need to have access to treat her. Shes going into isolation, I'm not going to risk station safety. Your not putting her on lock down Colonel. She needs constant medical supervision. She has contagion. Rules state contagion requires 48 hours lock down and observation. And if she dies in there? You'll have supervised access But that bay door will stay locked. [ System Alert ] Access is denied. Colonel, this is unacceptable protocol I need unconditional access to Ava 24/7. Colonel, do you hear me? I'm just as concerned about Cameron as you are. As commander, I'm bound by regulations. Shes gonna remain in isolation. You'll have access to her when ever you need, just let me know. How about now. Look, I'm not a medic do but according to your notes, shes late into her third trimester... when a babies organs are almost fully formed. How the hell's that possible? The diagnosis is that its some form of cyst. Might even be accelerated cancer, or replicated pregnancy its been known to happen. But what if these spores have some how infected her? Well then we'd be in deep shit. Oh God! Jesus Christ. No no no don't touch her. Shes dying man Cameron, Cameron come on. Ava, wake up! Ava can you hear me? Come on. Come on. We have her... What the hell are these things? Colonel, I need a light! Bruce! Snap out of it come on, give me light! What happened? Whatever caused the swelling burst you passed out. Shes hemorrhaging I need Ptoesium Nephragin, top shelf. Gentlemen we need to leave! She'll die unless we do something. This room is officially under quarantine. You can't lock me up in here? Lie down Ava! Ava, let me help you! I'm not leaving her. Why do you want to lock me up in here, what is wrong with you? Hey! Bruce, go! I will stop the hemorrhaging. Colonel, you have no jurisdiction here. I'm the stations doctor. Right the medical bay is yours, report to me when you're done. Can't do this to me you son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! No! Get lii aa! Shes infected, you could be now. She put her life on the line for us and this is how you repay her? You concentrate on fixing the communication device. Then command can figure out what to do with her. Until then... You follow my orders. Sure sure. I'll just follow orders. Figure we all got a bit of cabin fever, maybe a touch of carbon monoxide poisoning. Ell Captain ordered to lock Ava up and. Maybe one of these spores infected her and created some. Weird shit. And we've yet to find out what that is. Heating's been of for 7 hours. Starting to feel a chill. Well back to work. Senior engineer Bruce Johns, Moon base ARK. Screams! Ava, what are you doing? Ava! Ava! Ava! Let go! Sit on the bed! Ava calm down! Hold her! Help. What the hell is wrong with you, Calm down. Johns Johns, we need your help! It bit me! What the hell are you talking about? It bit me Alright! Alright! Something was in there! Hey, hey! Something was in here! There's nothing in here. Well something took a god dam bite out of my leg. Ah look! Bruce, listen to me you probably just got cut by some glass from the cabinet or a broken bottle OK. Its nothing... No, no no, listen listen! There's something god dam in here... There right there. I swear, Look. Go on look. I'm locking this room down let me know when your done. Look him over hes clearly got all the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning. Okay. Something was on top of me. I felt the weight of it on my chest, okay. This creature was feeding on my breast. It wasn't real their was nothing Ava. There is nothing in here, do you understand me? You' are hallucinating. Okay. Lie back down, I got to take a look at Bruce's cut, I will be right back. Bruce, meet me in the surgery bay, I'll take a look at that cut. I know something was in here with me. I know you saw it too. Is it possible I gave birth to something? I don't know. Close your eyes, and its 25 year old single malt. Oh God. The glass makes the wound is deep. Something bit me. Lay of that stuff will you, Its not helping. Listen I swear I saw something in there. Are you hearing things as well? You don't believe me. No, you and Ava, you have a lot of the same symptoms. Ye well, what if something used Ava to reproduce itself? A creature that's got know no DNA. You thinking about the spores again? Come on, admit it is possible. Once I have had a chance to examine the systemic fluids from Ava I can make a clear determination. But until then the most logical and reasonable one is that it was a, ingrowing fibrous cyst that burst. There was nothing in that room to prove otherwise. Now I want you to go get some rest, and that's an order. Ye. Colonel wants communications back. You know If you ask me, we don't have a hope in hell. Antenna's destroyed. What the...? Shit! Johns, are you working on those solar panels? We need power. Come on, come on! God! Yes it will. Come on. And. Look at this, you've reestablished communications, we can figure out a way to get of this rock. Johns just informed me the antennas destroyed. Whats his condition is he fit for duty, I need him. Hes worrying me hes showing signs of paranoia. Hes hallucinating. Is he drinking? Out of control, but he is clearly suffering from some kind of chemical exposure. I don't have the necessary resources to treat him properly. Never mind make a correct diagnosis. Do, it looks like its just you and me then ha. For now. I am not going insane. I am not going insane. I am not going insane! I am not going insane, I am not going insane! I am not going insane! I am not going insane! Johns? Johns? Johns? Hey. Johns, listen. Enough. I want you on that tread mill to sweat the alcohol out your system. And then I'm gonna treat you for monoxide poisoning. This, this stops here OK I need you back in function. Come on. Son of a bitch. I knew it. What? What are you doing? I need to see your finger. What? You came in direct contact with those spores. Why didn't you report this to medical, you know the rules. Sure ye your all about the rules aren't you, Colonel? We have station guidelines for a reason. Station guidelines? You mean like what to do when a crew member is sick as a dog after saving all your lives. Fuck you. Cameron, until Dr. Krauss can figure out what the hell is wrong with you. I am forced to keep you under surveillance. You mean locked up? If you don't release me your putting your own life in danger. You know I don't take threats likely. Your going to be facing a court marshal after this. I saw something. It wasn't a nightmare. Cameron. If you don't let me go, your putting your life and everyone else's in danger. Cameron, there nothing there you are suffering from contagion. I'm gonna have to put you in a isolation cell. Get back here. Let me go. Colonel. Son off a bitch! Lets take a look. Not yet, easy. Let's get that checked out. Yes. What happened in the corridor? It would appear the chain of command has broken down. Bruce attacked me he's lost his fucking mind. Go find him. I want an explanations. Shit, the door! Bruce? Ava... Bruce? Bruce! I know you're here. I'm not afraid of you anymore. Oh God oh! Fuck...! What the fuck is happening to me? Te! What the fuck is happening to me! Fuck...! Fuck! Cameron? Come on, wake up quit screwing around. Who released you? I'm not going to let you harm me. Ava, look I'm not here to harm you. Its company rules they state that I have to place you under lock and key. You're not going to put me in that cell. Something happened in here and you don't believe me. Please don't make me do this the hard way. No! No! God no!... What the hell happened? She attacked me. Come on lets restrain her! Get up. Come on. Let me take a look at Oh shit. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. What? What do you want? Stop it! Stop! What do you want? Stop! All right. Do you have an answer for this? Yes I do. She threatened me, and station guide lines. Rules require that I place her in an isolation cell. She's not seeing things clearly. She was contained. Until you went in there without consulting me. Well who released her ha? Bruce! Look... I looked at the surveillance tapes. Cameron cut her finger on a test tube containing those spores. You don't believe me? Take a look at her right for finger. She's infected. What's this? An alarm. I know what it is, why? Its an extra precaution. I'm keeping you under observation the antibiotics I gave are fairly strong. Hey. I had to protect myself. Okay I am not crazy. Why would you hide that from me? I was scared. Something came out of me didn't it? Tell me. I saw something in here. I wasn't dreaming. You have to release me. I can't do that now. You're making a huge mistake. Ask Bruce! Bruce, open the door! Bruce! Bruce open. What ever came out of Ava... Is here. I can see it. The fucking things... Its stalking me. Its studying me. It, Its driving me fucking crazy. I think I'm gonna die. Bruce? Bruce ah! Shit. O Jesus. What happened? It's Bruce. He's trying to kill me. When? Right now just a second ago. Bruce is dead. That's impossible. He was just here. Whatever you think you saw, think again. Because it wasn't Bruce. Colonel. There is something else inside this station with us. An it bread itself in Ava. Now its transformed itself into a replica of Bruce. They were both infected by the spores. Its been using the air shafts... To move around. We're gonna have to kill it. Then we're gonna need Ava to help us. Ava? Bruce is dead. How do you know that? I'm sensing what its doing. Ava, we need your help. You may be the only one who can control it. Not anymore. It might of used me to bread, but I'm as much a threat to it as you are. My guess is... is that it sampled Bruce's DNA when it bit him. It's figured out that the male is physically stronger so its replicated itself into him to survive. We still need your help. Can we trust you? You can trust me. This is Moon Base ARK, log entry 184. We have evidence of an alien life form. It used Lieutenant Cameron's body as a host. And now its mutated into a viable life form. It seems hell bent on killing us. It's taken on human form it should be easier to find. Somethings wrong. Compressor 4 is failing. Its cut of all of our oxygen. 3 not responding. He's trying to collapse the system. It doesn't make any sense. If this station implodes it'll die right along with us. It knows where the escape pod is though Bruce. I'll try the over ride system. See if you can find it. I'll come with you. The compressors failing! See the light. The lines been cut. Can you bypass it? Hows that. Oxygen's down. Lets go lets go lets go move come on! Come on. What are you doing? He knows we're trying to kill it. Ava. Its reading our positions through me. Cameron! Cam Stay with us! Ava! Come back. Fuck! Ava!, Wait. [Systems Alert] Danger! Air lock open system malfunction. Hey, get Ava to safety. While I close the door lock. That's crazy! We can't over ride the door from here! [Systems Alert] Danger! Air lock open system malfunction. God! [Systems Alert] Danger! Air lock open system malfunction. Give me your hand. [Systems Alert] Danger! Air lock open system malfunction. [Systems Alert] System over ride. [Systems Alert] System locked. [Systems Alert] Evacuation in 30 seconds. [Systems Alert] System locked access denied. Oh, hey! I'm getting the fuck out of here. [Systems Alert] System locked access denied. Access is denied. Try it again. It doesn't work. [Systems Alert] 9... [Systems Alert] 8. [Systems Alert] 7. [Systems Alert] 6. [Systems Alert] 5. [Systems Alert] 4. [Systems Alert] 3. [Systems Alert] 2. [Systems Alert] 1. Oh God. Its coming back. I can't stop it. Let's get to Bruce's quarters. Maybe hes discovered something about it that cam help us. Go go come on! Christ! Holy shit! Hes got something on his journal. This thing grew in Ava. I couldn't reveal to the crew, I was infected. I can't risk being put in isolation. Find what to do... Its cloning itself into me. I'm the one its replicating... I'm afraid off what it could become after... What its original form might be. Maybe a... As its evolved into a human form, it'll be easier to kill. Nothing in carbon monoxide. If your watching this right now... The only way any of you can survive.. Is to leave in the escape pod.. How long does it take to prep the pod? Too long. Unless... Sacrifice the entire station. Divert all reaming power to it, that should give it a kick start. Let's do it. Hey. Once we do this theirs no going back we only get one shot at it. Then we better make it work. We need this to prepare the pod for final ascension. If the emergency the power pack in the bay door plug this in. Its coming back this way. Ava. We can do this. Okay. Lets see what we've got here. I've diverted the fuel lines. Kick in the power when your ready. I'm on my way. Its coming back. Oh Gosh gosh... - Sorry. - I can not see anything. We prepped? The pods my be at 80% by the time we get there. Come on, let's go. I don't have a light I got it, I got it come on. [ System Alert ] Carbon monoxide level 4 and rising. [ System Alert ] Oxygen level compromised. Carbon monoxide doesn't make any sense hes gonna poison us all. Trying to do what Bruce said., we should do to kill us. Its opened the air lock to Bay 2. Get to the pod and initiate the launch sequence, go. No! We have to stick together. I can't coordinate the launch without you being there. Go. Go. [ System Alert ] Danger. [ System Alert ] Oxygen level compromised. Carbon monoxide level 2 and rising. Son of a bitch. There we go. [ System Alert ] Launch sequence initiated. Ava, I've initiated the launch. Punch in your code. Ava, do you copy? Ava? [ System Alert ] Carbon monoxide level 3. [ System Alert ] Launch in 3 minutes. We're at 80%. Gerard. Get down here. [ System Alert ] Danger! Oxygen level compromised! Gerard! Its here! In the launch bay! [ System Alert ] Launch in 2 minutes. Gerard! Ava! Breath! Hold it! [ System Alert ] Launch in 1 minute. Son of a bitch! It's locked, we can't over ride it. We have to stop the launch. Open. [ System Alert ] Launch in 30 seconds. Come, get in. [ System Alert ] Launch systems go... [ System Alert ] Launch initiated. Close the lid to the pod fileow.. I'm trying to do. [ System Alert ] 8. 7. 6. [ System Alert ] 5. 4. 3. [ System Alert ] 2. 1. [ System Alert ] Launch! Shit! Units dead. Check the emergency tanks. Go on. We have 17 minutes. Is that real? This is Colonel Brauchman. I have an urgent message. We have lost all contact with Earth control. I need to get an urgent message to Captain Madsen. This is an urgent transmission from Colonel Brauchman. Come in! Its the shuttle beacon My god about fucking time! Its landing. Do you think they'll make it? 50: 50. If we stay here, pry to god that they make it to us. Or its 3 and a half minutes to the landing dock. Can you hold your breath for 3 and a half minutes and run? Ye. Tails, we wait. Head we run our ass of. Fuck! Come on! There's still no communication from the moon base. All we have is the escape pods landing beacon. The door must of opened on impact. No sign of life. No one came out of here we would see tracks. Rescuers shuttle should of docked by now. Hopefully we will get some answer. Until then, we keep this low profile. Have you called ops, They'll be here in 10. Get this pod back to base under wraps. If the news hounds get wind of this... It'll be all over the networks. Seal of this area. No one gets in or out. Sir. I think you should see this. Mission control, this is Colonel Brauchman reporting from the USS shuttle Magellan. Madsen, whatever comes out of that pod kill it... Its not friendly it killed Klauss and Johns. It is clearly a threat to Mankind!...
