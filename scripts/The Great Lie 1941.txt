Oh, well, I suppose I'd better get back to this. I'll get these cleaned up. They're both asleep. - They are? - A nice-looking place this is, isn't it? - Still a party? - Till dawn. They've made a madhouse of this apartment since they were married. Oh, but I have to know about Philadelphia. I'm going to see her. I've got to know. I've got know. She told the reporters she was going on with her career. You're the husband. Guilty. Do you realize that Madam Kovak is due to play with the Philadelphia Symphony... ...on Tuesday? - Yes. The piano. Mr. Van Allen, your lawyer called three times. - He wants to see you. It's important. - Thank you. - He called yesterday. - Why didn't you tell me? - I did. - You did? - You were saying something, sir? - I am madam's manager. She's due in Philadelphia, Tuesday. House is sold out. - I've got to know. - Well, you sit right down here now. I know little about madam's musical talent. I just married the lady. Oh, an artist like Madam Kovak should be married in a cathedral. A wedding of importance. Everything she does is of importance. Instead of which she runs away like a chorus girl. Yeah. It was all very impulsive, wasn't it? - Would you like a drink? - No. - Cigarette? - No. Morning paper? Maybe a sedative to cool you off and quiet you down. - No. - Would you like a glass of milk? Well, what do you want? There's only one thing I want. Madam Kovak. I've got to see Madam Kovak and I'm going to wait until I do. Well, sleep tight. The house is yours. What's that...? What's that peculiar smell around here? Fresh air. I've just opened the window. Oh, yes. Skoal? - Hello, Jock. - Hello. - How's the lawyer? - How's the bridegroom? Not so good. You could've told a friend, who's your lawyer, you intended to marry Sandra. - You looked on the wine, I take it. - You may take it. I did. You haven't been out in daylight for a week. Well, there's something about that woman. There must be. She's a great pianist, a great beauty. But after all, marriage is a step. - It's a leap. - In the dark. Well, it's morning now. Seriously, Pete. Are you going through with this? - Well, we're married. - That's just it. - What? - You're not. - What do you mean we're not married? - Sandra's divorce wasn't final. Well, don't be silly. She gave that party to celebrate her final divorce. You climaxed the party by getting married. That's what they told me when I woke up. Look, Pete, her divorce decree cannot be entered until next Tuesday. - The lady got her dates mixed. - You mean, we're not really married? Not unless you do it again. If you wanna go through with this, you'll have to marry her soberly and legally. It will all be arranged very simply for you to be married by a judge, if you want to. Come out and have lunch and we'll talk it over. Oh, no. No. What I need is some nice, clean fresh air. I know where I can get it. - You'd better pull yourself together, Pete. - Don't worry. I will. Thanks very much. So long, Pete. Mr. Pete. Violet, Violet. What is it? It's Mr. Pete, flying down from the sky like an angel of the Lord. Hush your mouth. Don't go calling that man's name. He ain't coming here no more. He's on his honeymoon, he is. How are you, Mr. Pete? Hello, Jefferson. - Been raining? - Yes, sir. Been pouring down. - Where's Miss Maggie? - Violet's right in there. She's the one that knows about Miss Maggie's whereabouts. Man, did you see that old airplane come a-raring and a-snorting? Man, I sure did. Hello, Violet. No use using that whistle, Mr. Pete. That sound belongs to the days that is gone. Where's Miss Maggie? Mr. Pete, if you take my advice, you'll get right back in that airplane... ...and fly away like a bird right back where you come from. I've just arrived and I wanna see Miss Maggie. Where is she? Mr. Pete, if you take my advice, you'll get right back in that airplane and... Now, nobody ain't gonna use no force, Mr. Pete. If your conscience don't keep you from going up, your manners should. Just think, Mr. Pete. I have been thinking. The whole of the morning. We has had our thoughts too. And they ain't been very good company. Violet. Yes, Miss Maggie. Your name ain't Violet, Mr. Pete. My goodness, honey child. Lay down before you catch more cold. Is he drinking? What do you care if he's drinking or if he ain't? Tell him I'm busy and I've got a cold. - Are you taking your medicine? - Yes. I'm much better. I don't wanna see him anyway. That's what I told him but I'll tell him again. You go down and be nice and polite now. Tell him I've got a cold, that I'm busy and that I... I can't see him, can I? No, Miss Maggie. You can't. Well? Why not? Don't ask me the reason why not. Just tell me the reason why. She's got a bad cold, Miss Maggie has. How did she catch it? Walking in the rain alone. Then coming home soaking wet and sitting down thinking... ...and forgetting she's wet. Thinking so hard about someone or something. Oh, I see. We sees too, Mr. Pete. We sees the papers. It's a fine thing when you read news about your friends in the papers. Well, I'm sorry. Miss Maggie never tell you, not till Judgment Day, what you done. But I knows and you knows, Mr. Pete, there's only one thing to do now... ...and that's to go away and stay away, Mr. Pete. You get right back in that airplane and fly away. Pete. What's the matter with you? What's the matter with me? Oh, you got a cold. - Yes. - What are you taking for it? None of your business. - Well, how did you get it? - I got wet. You didn't have sense enough to come in out of the rain. - Lf I had any sense. If I had any sense... - I wouldn't be in your life. No, you wouldn't. Just like this cold, a sneeze or two and you'd be gone. Your nose is pink. Your eyes are red. And violets are blue and sugar is sweet and I wish you'd go. I asked you to come up... ...because I didn't want you to think I was afraid to see you. Like a little child hiding in her room. Hey. - What? - Sit down. Look at that. Without your shoes on. - What are you doing here anyway? - I wanna talk to you. You wanna talk to me? You act as if nothing had happened. Well, among other things, l... I'm thinking about going back into aviation. You know, there's a lot doing now. Hemisphere defense and all that stuff. - Whose idea is this? - Yours. Don't you remember? The day after New Year's. There was snow and we skated and... Yeah, and I proposed. And I refused. Oh, Pete, let's not go into this all over again. You see, the unfortunate thing for me is that... And I'm not whining. - It's been like this for four years. On and off and off and on. Well, there was only one thing I ever asked you. One thing I begged you to do. To be a sober, solid citizen. Well, sober anyway. But I guess the prospect was too dull for you. Well, now it's all over... ...and I feel the way I did when they took the bands off my teeth. And I had those blasted things for four years too. Yeah, I know. Tell me honestly, is this marriage of yours going to help? If I thought it would, I'd be so for it. Well, you know Sandra. Yes, I do. You like her? I hate her. Oh, not because you're married to her, Pete, but you know. Well, I won't talk about her. The fact remains that whatever she was or is... ...she is your wife and I can't discuss her. - Maggie, let me... - Oh, Violet was right. You shouldn't have come and I shouldn't have seen you. I wonder what you think of me, really. You know what I think of you. You think of me as you would a nagging, haggling wife and I'm not. I'm young. I like to drink and dance and go to parties... ...like other people do. Every time I see you, I feel like your little old gray-haired mother... ...with the roses over the door and the lamp in the window. Well, the lamp's out. That's not true. Anyway, I'm tired of being your... Your haven. - Did your wife know you came here? - No. Don't you think it would've been nicer if you'd told her? Yes, but she was asleep. Besides, I wanted some fresh air... ...and I wanted to talk to you about something. Aviation. No, but... Well, we all make blunders. Have you come behind her back in the first week to tell me you've blundered? - No. - Then what did you come here to tell me? I don't know. I'm sorry. Come in. Excuse me, Miss Maggie, I just had to come up. - Mr. Pete, you is bad for us around here. - Violet. Your lady wife must be waiting for you now. I'm sure your intentions are of the best but this is a personal matter. There's nothing personal between Maggie that ain't personal with me. - Why, since she's that big, I've always... - Violet, please. Pete, you'd better go. Perhaps I'd better. I did tell you about that aviation thing, didn't I? - Yes. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Sorry, Violet. Please, Violet. Stop, please. - Are you still here? - Yes. Did you see her? No, and I'm not leaving till I do. She sent word she would wait till you got back... ...and then talk it over with you. It's a crime. Those are her new records out today. The woman's a sensation. And this concert waiting for her with the Philadelphia Symphony. How would you like a little drink? Cigarette? Glass of milk? No, I want Madam Kovak. - Oh, that's where I came in. - No. - What's that? - Oh, that's been going on for a long time. No. - What's the matter? - You opened the window this morning... ...and I caught cold in my shoulder. Do I get a kiss or don't I? We've been talking and he agrees with me. That's nice. About going on with my work. After all these years of working, it'd be silly to give it up. Of course, he's right. My name is Peter Van Allen. Oh, I'm so sorry, darling. Get out. You hurt. Pardon, madam. This is Worthington James. Oscar. Well, how do you do? How do you do? Oh, Petie, ring the bell. I don't think I've ever had such a headache in my life. Pay that little man. I think he's made it worse. Bertha. Bertha, I want a cup of black coffee with brandy in it. Do you think that'd be best? Would you like one? - No, dear. - No? No. Worthy James waited to meet you. He's one of my oldest and best friends. He gave me the money for my piano lessons here in New York with Vannez. How old was I then, Worthy? Too young. How do you like my Pete now that you've seen him? Very good. Go get a drink, Petie. You look sad. You failed me. I expected you to come in with something to say. Something amusing. He's a gay lad, really. I'm sure of it. Oh, Pete, go and tell poor old Joshua I'll call him up in an hour. I want to talk to you first. Go along now. Well, I must be hopping. Oh, don't hop yet, Worthy. Stick around a bit. - Would you like cheese or some port? - No. - What about Philadelphia? - She'll call you in an hour. - I guarantee it. - Thanks. I'll be at home waiting. - I'll show you out. - No, don't bother. - Goodbye, old man. - Goodbye. Bertha. Come here. Take this tray away. I hate the smell of food. - Don't look like that. Are you angry? - No. Worthy James has been like a father to me. Oh, why, I haven't a jealous emotion in me. I could take that two ways. Where were you today? You didn't even call. Oh, I went down to see my good lawyer, Jock... ...then I flew down to Maryland. - Whatever for? - Fresh air. - Did you get it? - What? The air. Well, what would you like to do? Do you feel like kissing me? Oh, Pete. You've got to be patient with me, Pete. I've been a bachelor so long. So have you, for that matter. I should have been a dutiful wife... ...and whipped up a little home dinner for you today. You know, one of the most attractive things about you to me... ...has always been that you understood women. Now, you're going to try and understand me, aren't you? I wonder if you could ease up on this party life of yours. You know, come away some place quietly. Some golf and some walks and some fresh air. Golf? Walks? Me? Pete, this is a side of you I've never seen. By the way, I haven't told you. We'll have to do it again. - What? - Get married. - Are you kidding? - No. I'll have to propose and you'll have to say yes... ...and then we can be married again. That's what Jock wanted to see me about today. But I don't see what was wrong. It seems your divorce from Mr. Stokes will not be final until next Tuesday. Ridiculous. It was final when I married you. I'm afraid you're mistaken. The decree can't be entered until next Tuesday. - You had your dates mixed. - Dates bore me. Then we're not actually married. That's it. Did you tell someone in Maryland all this? She must have been very amused. And if there's one thing I adore, it's being laughed at. And by a woman. Of course I haven't told anyone. Well, are you gonna propose to me again? I think we should sit down and talk this thing out... ...and see where we're going. Then we can be married next Tuesday. - I'll be playing in Philadelphia. - Put it off. Is there a doubt in your mind that we could make a go of this? Well, I'm asking you to marry me. You were much more amusing the first time. I'm sober now. Well, suppose you go out and get yourself into another mood? All right. Pete. When are you coming back? - Next Tuesday. - I'll be in Philadelphia. That's the day we're going to be married. I have asked you to marry me on Tuesday. I've already told you I won't be here. Then don't go to Philadelphia. - Is that Miss Kovak's room? - In there, ma'am. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. - Here you are. - It's so warm. I'll get your wrap. You were magnificent. Bravo. Bravo. - Hello. How are you? - Oh, darling, you were never better. - Darling. - How are you? Let's have some food. I've never known you when you played so magnificently. Sweet of you to come around, but I'm catching the New York plane. What happened to that young man you ran away with? - What? Hello. Come in. - Oh, hello. He's still running. I've only paused for breath. If that's Peter Van Allen I know, don't let him get out of your sight. You might have let us know. We were in New York. Well, I'm afraid that party was a little wild even for you and Harry. Excuse me just a moment. - Hello, Maggie. - Hello. - Weren't you out front at all? - No, I just got in at 10: 15. Oh, and you came right back to see me. How sweet. Where's Pete? In New York. Did you come to see him? I came to see you both. I thought he'd be here naturally. How did you know I was playing here? - Called your apartment in New York. - Pete's there? No, there wasn't any answer so I talked to the porter downstairs. You see, I was calling from Washington. Well, would you like me to give a message to Pete for you? Yes. Let's go into my dressing room for a moment. Sit down, Maggie. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. I've just had one. Sweating like a stoker. Well, don't catch cold. I'm just over one. - May I bring you anything? - No, thank you. Pete left the window open while I was in bed and I caught cold in my shoulder. I didn't play very well tonight. I'm sure he did it on purpose. One thing, there's never a dull moment with Pete. Tell me, did you find him stubborn? When? Well, you were engaged to him twice, weren't you? Yes. You're looking very well under the circumstances. What circumstances? You said you had a cold. Oh, yes, but I said I was over it. The cold? Definitely. Good for you. Now, what is it you want me to tell Pete? It's an idea I've had for him for a long time. If you write it, I won't open the letter if you mark it "Personal from Maggie." I went to Washington to see my Uncle Ted. After Pete told me he was going to offer himself to the government. What for? Income tax? Aviation. Didn't he tell you his plans? Not about flying for the government, no. No, I'm going to keep Pete on the ground. What is this scheme? Pete is an expert of maps and navigation. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in England. Oh, he has a natural instinct for it. And that coupled with his flying... ...makes him the kind of man the government's gonna need. Uncle Ted said all he'd have to do would be to apply for a job. Well, that's very kind of you, Maggie. But I like Pete where he is and as he is. Well, he's your husband. Yes, he is. Supposing you go. I came... - It was just a thought. - Oh, and a very sweet one. If I didn't think you meant so well, I'd feel like slapping your face. On that one point, Sandra, we deeply understand each other. - Don't miss your little train, Maggie. - I won't. I want to make a party-to-party call. What? Person-to-person call then. Mr. Peter Van Allen. V-A-N A-L-L-E-N. In New York. Gramercy, 550264. If he's not there, try the Racquet Club. If he's not there, try the Yale Club. Find him. His wife, Mrs. Van Allen, is calling. Hurry it up. - Jefferson, whose car is that? - Mr. Pete's. - When did he come? - This morning. Why didn't you tell me? Violet promised me she'd sweep him out of the house with the trash... ...while I was getting you from the station. But why didn't you tell me? Well, we wasn't gonna say anything if Violet done got him cleared out. You done had all the botheration you can stand. I heard a roar like thunder and in come this machine a-flying through the gate. It done tore down part of the gate. Slammed on the brakes and might've thrown itself through the window. - Miss Maggie. - Yes? We tried every means at our disposal... ...outside of witchcraft, to get him out of the house. But he wasn't in no moving mood. - I do think you have your nerve. - Now, hold your horses. I will not. This isn't a roadhouse... ...that you can drop in and out of. I don't want you here. Go to your wife. - Don't be a fool. - Don't touch me. Let's not brawl. At least listen to what I have to say. Supposing you go. A prisoner has a chance to speak before he's sentenced. - You sound like a book, a cheap one. - The prison line was a good simile for me. All right, laugh. Supposing I admit I haven't had a particularly happy time lately. It's been a shock. I did love you more than anything else in the world and it does hurt. Now, what could you say that would alter that? What? Do you suppose I'd come here if I didn't have something to say? - Definitely bearing on what you just said. - No, but what about your wife? Sandra? Well, Sandra was not properly divorced from my predecessor, Mr. Stokes... ...when it was thought that we were married. The necessity for a second marriage ceremony... ...was explained to me by my lawyer, Jock Thompson, last Wednesday... ...when I came here to see you. But you didn't tell me that. I should liked to have told you but I had a clear duty ahead of me. I returned and explained the situation to Sandra. I asked her to marry me when her divorce papers were final. That was yesterday, Tuesday. But she preferred to go to Philadelphia and perform on her piano. So I waited in New York until midnight. And then by every stroke of my conscience, I was free. So I came down here to tell you about it. I've always told you everything about myself, haven't I? Give me a cigarette. I've got a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach. This room is full of ghosts. I haven't been in this part in years. Yes, you know, we're going to have to do something about this room. Violet... ...lunch. Ham, cakes, honey and coffee. Jefferson. Jefferson. Jefferson. You go right out and get that peanut-fed hickory-smoked, sweet Virginia ham. You ain't gonna feed that man, is you? Listen, Jefferson. I'd feed the devil himself... ...if he'd polish up the smile on Miss Maggie's face like that. Violet, you better practice ducking. Ducking, what for? When that high-toned New York lady what he done married... ...comes stomping here with that gun... - Gun? There's gonna be shooting here and shooting there. No dog's gonna be safe. I ain't gonna have nothing to do with it myself. I ain't worried now. Steady, Jefferson, here we go. I'm steadying. Nice music. Yes. Must be something very special going on around here. Oh, yes. Yes, a wedding. Oh, friends of yours? I've known them both for years. Personally, I'm glad the suspense is over. They've been messing about at getting married ever since I can remember. - Fools. - Yes. Was it a nice wedding? The usual thing: "Do you? I do." Kiss the bride. Have some cake. - That's a good idea. - What? Kiss the bride. Why do I love you? Because I am so beautiful. You know, you are a funny-looking little thing. - What? - But I do like your face. And that crooked little tooth when you smile. - And your hair. - What's the matter with my hair? That cowlick. You couldn't even fix it for your wedding, could you? I can hear your heart. It's beating so fast. Don't be silly. That's my watch. It's still beating. Well, it's getting late. I really should be on my way, you know. Dear. So should I. I'm on my honeymoon. So you are. Yes. - Having a lovely time? - Lovely, so far. All right. - Maggie. - What? You've shrunk. Oh, I forgot. Maggie Patterson, are you still doing that? - Well, they hurt. - Well, then sit down. Do you remember the first time I met you? At a football game. Yes, you had lost your shoes. And you had to carry me out. Yup. And when you clutched me around the neck, I said: "Pete, old boy, you're hooked." And Pete, old boy, you are. Pete. Pete, no. All right, I won't argue with you. You can make the house white. - The trees white, the dogs white. - I'll paint you white if... Darling, now listen. Mr. Talbot's waiting. He's a very busy man. I think we should start in this room in here, don't you? You know, Papa preferred this room to his own study. Well, we can redo the ceiling. That was his chair. He even let the dogs sit here. And lots of mint juleps if I remember. - Oh, yes, nice big ones. - He was a tough gentleman, your father. - Yes, he was. - Yeah. And I can be tough too. - What about, for instance? - About you. - Oh, I don't believe... - Oh, Pete, stop it. Here's Violet. What's this, Violet? A letter for Mrs. Van Allen. I signed for it. Washington. Anything bad? He has to go to Washington at once. And you just married five days? I'd just let that letter blow away in the wind. - Violet. - Yes, Mr. Pete? - Take off the covers in the other room. - Yes, sir. - How about curtains? - Curtains? I think some nice bright chintz. You know, brighten the whole room up. Hey... ...that letter for me? Oh, no. It's for me, from Uncle Ted. Venetian blinds? - Venetian blinds? - Oh, Venetian blinds? Yeah. Well, why don't you just...? You're an expert, you know? You do the whole thing and let me know tomorrow. - All right. - Thank you. Hey. Talbot's gonna take a look around and bring some estimates tomorrow. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Oh, yes, there is. - Anything in that letter? - No. - Let me see it. - No, I won't let you. You will let me see because I'll get it anyway. Give me that. All right. I would have had to tell you anyway. It's from Washington and they want you to leave at once. Really? Let me see it. Uncle Ted says, " If Peter is serious... ...I strongly advise that he lose no time in coming here." Then he goes on to say that Aunt Ada is in New York now and... I have an idea. You fly to Washington. And I'll go on to New York, stay with Aunt Ada. You see your man in Washington, come to New York and we'll have a spree. - What do you say? - Why, that's great. You were going to lie to me. You were gonna hold out on me. With those innocent little eyes of yours. Darling, I know you must go but I hate it. Now, now. We made a bargain, didn't we? Maggie, you smell of hay and horses and sunshine. Gee, what lovely kids you're going to have. Yes, hello. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Yes, I understand. Oh, operator, when the long-distance call comes through for Mrs. Van Allen... ...she's in the Palm Lounge. Mr. James. Hey, Emile. Where is Mrs. Van Allen? Oh, Mrs. Van Allen? Oh, yes, madam. She's there. Say, where are you going, dear? It's Maggie. I must congratulate her. Order me... ...a double. Hello, Sandra. Congratulations. Thank you. Where is Pete? Washington. - So you did get him into the air. - Yes. Maggie, I'm giving you fair warning. I'm going to get him back. Pete's married to me now, Sandra. There wasn't any flaw in that ceremony, was there, Maggie? You'd see to that, wouldn't you? Do we have to go on with this? I've canceled my Australian tour. Really? Maggie, I'm going to have a baby. - Pete's? - Yes. But you wouldn't. You couldn't. - You're wrong, Maggie. I can and I will. - Mrs. Van Allen, please. - Yes. - Your long-distance call, ma'am. Thank you. Hello. - Hello. - Hello, darling. I'm talking from your Uncle Ted's house. Hello, darling. Hold on, will you? I'll go upstairs. No, there isn't time. I said, I haven't time. I'm leaving on a trip immediately. - Well, yes, dear, I know it's a shock but... - Well, I'm down in the bar. I can't hear anything. Let me go upstairs, will you? What? You did? How long? - Well, that's very quick, isn't it? - It was sheer luck. You had the right hunch. If I'd been a day later, I'd have missed it. Your Uncle Ted will explain everything to you. Yes, he wants you to come back here with your Aunt Ada. And stay here until I return. Well, do you know for how long? Oh, you don't? I see. Tell him I'm with you. Well... Well, darling, goodbye and take good care of yourself. Goodbye, my darling. There's a kiss. Did you hear it? Well, send one back. Aren't you pleased? Oh, yes, of course I'm pleased. Goodbye, Pete. Goodbye. Pete going away? You're going to lose him, Maggie. I'm going to get him back. Time will take care of that. I told you I'm going to have a child. You're lying. Time will take care of that. Ask Mrs. Greenfield if she will come into the study. Yes, sir. The senator said he would like to see you in the study, ma'am. - What for? Who's with him? - Colonel Harriston. Colonel Harriston. I'd love to meet him, Aunt Ada. You will, dear. We'll have him in to tea. What is it? Oh, how do you do, Colonel Harriston? Mrs. Greenfield. The plane's missing. Peter Van Allen? Oh, that poor girl. - Maggie. - Yes. - Come here, dear. - Yes, Aunt Ada. Come into the study. Hello, Uncle. This is Colonel Harriston. - Not the Colonel Harriston? - Mrs. Van Allen. How do you do? Maggie, we've had some news about Pete and his party. It's not altogether hopeless but... Colonel. They've been missing for 24 hours over the Brazilian jungle. Brazilian jungle? Missing? Yes. The terrain is a little difficult. It takes some time to get a searching party and their planes back over there. It's very rough and none of them have been able to make a landing yet. And the weather wasn't any too good. They were on their way back. Actually, they were due last night. Of course, we don't know. I wouldn't say that it was hopeless but... Did you say you had sent a searching party out for him? Yes. As far as we know, the only point they could land... ...is 40 miles from where they last heard from the plane. The country's very thick and it may take a little time. Yes, I see. But they're all experienced men. Brady, who's with them, knows the country as well as it's possible to know it. I'm very sorry, Mrs. Van Allen. Oh, thank you. It's not hopeless. Mr. And Mrs. Latan... ...and Madam and Miss Rosinni are in the drawing room. Very well. I suppose this is still secret. - Yes, I was going to point that out. - Oh, I understand. Come, darling. - Doesn't look very good, does it? - No, it doesn't. Jefferson. You go up and see what Miss Maggie wants. I just can't stand to look at her face. Who is that gentleman upstairs with Miss Maggie? That gentleman is from New York. That's Mr. Pete's lawyer, that is. It's so hard to believe... ...so hard to understand. I know, Maggie, but you've got to think of yourself, some sleep, some food. What for? There's nothing. I really don't care. There's nothing. All these weeks he's been missing, I've kept hearing him come over here... ...with that silly little plane... ...and his signal going: - I really heard him this morning. - What? Of course it was only Jefferson and his lawn mower. There was no one else like him alive. Do you remember those ridiculous sketches... ...and that silly old whistle and...? - But you know him very well, didn't you? - Oh, yes. School, college, his lawyer. I knew Pete. - You've got to forgive me. - Oh, of course, my dear. Oh, yes. Jefferson, Mr. Thompson will stay for lunch. - Yes, Miss Maggie. - Will you have a drink? If you'll have one, it might be good. - Bring Mr. Thompson a mint julep. - Yes. And, Jefferson, don't you and Violet go around looking like that. Mr. Pete's just gone, that's all. Yes'm, just gone. Yes, Miss Maggie. Nice people. Oh, yes. They both loved Pete very much. Everyone did. Oh, by the way, Sandra called me at 4:00 this morning. Somebody saw it in the early editions and called her. She's out of her mind. Is she? There is a satisfaction in knowing when he went out... ...he was doing something worthwhile. - Oh, I know, I've thought of that. I've thought of everything that would make it easier. - But, you see, I made him do it. - He was a very happy man, Maggie. He was very happy to go on that trip. He called me from Washington the day he left. He called himself "the big family man." He wanted children. Yes, I know he did. That would have been something, wouldn't it? What? Something of his. To live on. - Yes. - Oh, if I could only scream or something. Maggie. Maggie. Oh, I'm sorry. This... This letter registered special came from Sandra. - For you? - No, it's for Pete. Oh, well, I'll send it back to her. It seems like a very long letter. I think I'll go to New York with you. I was going to suggest you didn't stay down here alone. Yes. - Jock, let's leave right away. - All right. I'll hurry. Miss Kovak? She's not at home. May I wait? It won't do any good. Could I leave her a note? Well, you may. Have you a piece of paper and pencil? Yes, miss. Thank you. Who was it, Bertha? I must speak to you. Were you lying when you told me you may be going to have a child? Pete's child? Does that matter now? If it's true, it does. It happens not to be true. Then you were lying. Yes. Sandra, do you remember telling me sarcastically in Philadelphia... ...if I wished to leave Pete a letter marked "personal," he'd receive it unopened? Here's a letter from you to Pete marked "personal." In that you tell him you're going to have a child. Yes, yes, yes. Sandra, be honest with yourself. You only wanted that child... ...when you thought you could get Pete back, didn't you? Now he's dead. I came here to ask you for that child. - What? - I was married to Pete. I could give him Pete's name. I could give him everything that Pete could have given him, had he lived. Sandra, why shouldn't you hate me? It's the same old story, isn't it? We both loved the same man. So you admit that, do you? Of course I must admit it. I do believe there's one true thing about you, Sandra. And that's your feeling for Pete. You know, I can't think of him as gone. How he loved life. He left us two things in this world. I have his money, you might have his child. You're extravagant, you're a woman of the world, a public figure. Your piano, your success, they won't go on forever. None of us gets younger. Let me ensure your future and you ensure mine. - Your future? - His child. That could be my future. And I'd make you secure financially always. - Money. - Yes. That's so completely mad. Oh, think, Sandra. Oh, no, I couldn't do it now. It's different. I'd be alone. I'd be afraid. But you needn't be. I won't leave you for an instant. You? Sandra... ...let's call a truce. - A what? A truce until it's over. - You haven't told anyone else? - Of course not. We'll go away secretly. You say no one knows, no one else will know. Don't worry about anything. Leave the arrangements, everything to me. Hello. Oh, I'll do that. Here's the latest issue of Fashion. The smell of cooking is making me sick. Boiled vegetables. And chicken. You can't have steak every day. There. That's better. You won't strain your eyes. Oh, I brought you something. - What is it? - Open it and see. Sadie? Here's some more apples. She's raising a rumpus about the stew. I know, but she can't have steak every day. I ordered them from New York. Piano and orchestra. Here, let me play them for you. Whatever gave you the idea that he's a pianist? He's a fake. Sorry. I guess I don't know much about music. Well, here are your things. Cologne, talc, bath salts, lilac. Couldn't get gardenia. Vitamin B tablets. What's in the big box? Oh, things that we'll need later. What things? Stuff the doctor ordered. Oh, I got you something else too. You like color, Sandra, look. Isn't that pretty? Lovely. Suppose you wear it. Did you bring my sleeping tablets? - No. - Forget them? - No. - Well, why? Well, I asked the doctor. - What did he say? - He said no. You couldn't have told him how badly I was sleeping. I told him how badly I was. It amounted to the same thing. I don't ask you sit up nights with me. Oh, I know you don't. I have to keep my eyes on you. Hey, how many? My third since lunch. Three, four, five, six, seven. This pack holds 20. All right, all right, all right. I smoked 12 cigarettes since lunch. If you really wanna know, I had six this morning. - I knew that. - Spying on me. - I have to. - Why? Because you're such a liar. - You smoke your head off. - Oh, sure, but that's me. I'm not special. What do you want me to do, sit here and go crazy? Why don't you take a walk? Oh, it's too cold. Wear your fur coat. That's a good idea. I'll wear my new mink cape. There might be a photographer from Fashion... ...waiting to snap me as I step over a cactus. Sandra. Ham, onions, butter... ...everything the doctor said you couldn't have. What have you got behind your back? Come on. Hand it over. Pickles. Oh, Sandra. Yes, pickles. I like them. - I know you do. - I want them. I'm sick and tired of doing without things I want. You and that doctor with your crazy ideas of what I can and what I can't eat. You're starving me. But you've kept very well on this diet. You know you have. And it's not for much longer. And left alone, how you eat. That's the way I'm made. I'm not one of you anemic creatures... ...who can get nourishment from a lettuce leaf. I'm a musician. I'm an artist. I have zest in appetite and I like food. I've been lying awake thinking about food and now I'm gonna have it... Sandra, Sandra, sit down. I'll make you a sandwich. But no pickles. No onions? A very thin slice. Whoever heard of an ounce of brandy? The doctor said, as long as you were used to brandy, you could have an ounce a day. But no more. Come on, Sandra, play. Just because you don't drink. Oh, I do, I love a drink. I haven't had any up here... ...because you weren't allowed it. - That's very kind of you. I suppose you think I'm a chronic alcoholic. Oh, Sandra, I don't. This will probably turn into a cyclone, one of those tornadoes... ...you read about in the newspapers, and blow us all away. I wish it would. I'm stifling. Well, let's... Let's play over here. Come on, Sandra. We've got time for one more game. The wind is driving me mad. Can't you do something about that lamp? It's a pity you couldn't have found a place with electric light. Well, I could have. I'd have also found newspaper reporters. If you want privacy, you have to pay for it. Why don't you tell me I've smoked enough? Well, if it will take your mind off the weather... That's right, be patient with me. I'm a spoiled child, an imbecile, to be humored. Maggie, the martyr. You make me sick. As for keeping my mind off weather, who brought me here? - Come on, Sandra. Let's play. - You brought me here. I've had enough. I'm fed up with the whole business. I'm going to get out of here. Sandra. No, you can't keep me here and I won't stay. I won't stay. Don't go like this. It's not good for you. I'm going to the garage and start that car and get out. Be careful with that lamp, you'll set the house on fire. Oh, I will? That will be fine. - That will settle everything. - Sandra. You burned me. You burned me. No. No. Sandra, I'm sorry. Really, I am. I'm sorry. Come on. Maggie. Maggie. Isn't that doctor here yet? He should be any minute. Ed left an hour ago. I never thought I'd be doing this with some hick doctor taking care of me. He's not a hick doctor. Oh, no, he's a Park Avenue specialist. That's why he's in Arizona delivering babies at a nickel a bunch. You know very well why. He could easily be a Park Avenue specialist if he wanted. That's what he says. Now, look, Sandra, I know you're uncomfortable. But don't worry about Dr. Ferguson. I know about him, that's why I took this place. He's had a brilliant record at Johns Hopkins. Oh, I suppose he knows his job. I wish he'd get here. You smoke a lot, don't you? Yes. Sadie, don't leave her alone for a minute. - So you never had a child of your own? - No. A pity. Just the sort of woman that should have them. - Oh, well, you'll have plenty of time. - I suppose so. It spells life with capital letters. A woman without a child is like a man without an arm. The right arm. Tragic, the father dying before the child was born. Did you know the father? Yes. What sort of man was he? Oh, he was handsome and clever and gay. - Will you have some coffee? - Yeah. Doctor? Do you know what I miss here tonight? I miss the father standing around getting in everybody's way. Waiting for me to say: "Well, old man, it's all over and they're doing nicely." Doctor? All right. There he is, safe and sound. Pete. Oh, Pete, my darling. Bravo. Now, here, you see, is the river. The Amazon. - And down here is Manaos. - Manaos. The nearest point which they could be brought. Up here, this section here. That's all jungle. It's almost impassable. But where were they heard of? Here? Oh, I can't tell you that. All I know is that the searching party left Manaos yesterday by canoe. They must have had something to go on. Of course, it's just the vaguest chance. What are you up to? Hello, Colonel Harriston. I didn't know you were here. You're always whispering. Want your coffee here? - Come here, darling. - What? Harriston has come over to tell me there's a faint chance... ...of at least two of those men being alive down here in Brazil. Do you mean Pete? Well, they have rumors of whites living with natives up here. Miles away from anywhere. - You mean Peter Van Allen? - Possibly. We don't know that. There's a rescue party going in to see. Then I must telephone to Maggie at once but I don't know where to get her. Last I heard was a post card months ago... ...from, I think, the Grand Canyon. Something about Old Faithful. I wouldn't say a word. Remember the suspense when they were lost? - I'll never forget it, nor Maggie's face. - We don't want that. After all, it's just a chance. No, I think you're quite right. I shan't say a word. Oh, Ted. Do you realize it's months since we've heard from that girl? All the better. Save us some awkward moments while we're waiting. - Yeah. You're not going, colonel. - I'm afraid I must. - I wanna follow this thing through. - Oh, well, I'm sorry. Anyone would think you hadn't been fed for a month. Here, Mabel, greedy. Give your sister a chance. Now, that's all for today. It's Petie's feeding time, Miss Maggie. We're coming. Come on, Petie, going in to lunch. Come on. Come on. There we go. Pete, now we'll have a little lunch. Yes, we will. Now we're gonna have our lunch. Come on. Come on, darling. - I got his lunch all ready for him. - We know. You know, I was thinking, Violet, Mr. Pete went to college at Yale. I suppose he'd like Young Pete to go there too. Yes, Miss Maggie. Shall I go up and pack his things now... ...or would in the morning be soon enough? Oh, Violet. He sure going to look mighty funny up at that Yale college without any teeth. I am silly. Now you're talking sense. Straining your eyes to appear 20 years ahead. What you going to be doing in the meantime? Bringing up this young gent. You is young, Miss Maggie, and your little boy needs a pappy. And you, Miss Maggie, you ain't hardly had no marriage at all. Nope. No other man for me. You're the man of the family now, aren't you, Pete? We mustn't spoil him, Violet. No, ma'am. What's that? Oh, Pete, you're getting bigger every single day. It looks like your Aunt Ada's automobile coming through the gate. Really? Well, I didn't know she was coming. - You'd better take Pete and feed him. - Yes'm. - Aunt Ada will probably stay for lunch. - Yes'm. - Violet, there's the telephone. Answer it. - Yes'm. Violet will lay you down here. I is a-coming, telephone. Hello there. What a surprise. Where did you spring from? Washington. I came like the wind. How are you, Maggie? Never felt better. - I want to talk to you. - Come on in then. - Is that your baby crying? - Oh, yes. Violet's with him. Darling, let me have your things. Maggie, I hardly know how to begin. - But you're trembling. What is it? - Miss Maggie. - Miss Maggie. - Yes, what's the matter? You're wanted on the telephone. It's a telegram. I just couldn't write it down. You better go. All right. Excuse me, Auntie. Violet... ...I came down to be with her when she got the news. - It is a telegram? - Yes'm. Just like the grave opened up and spoke. Quiet, Young Pete. Hello. Yes? Yes, this is Mrs. Van Allen. Go ahead. From where? - Signed Pete? - Ted was down in a place called Manaos... Oh, but... Darling. What? Go ahead. Yes? "Could not wait telephone connection." Yes. "On my way"? - Your uncle telephoned me this morning... - Auntie Addy, please? Go ahead. Yes? "Arrive Cartersville." Yes. "About midnight Thursday." "Love, Pete." Oh, thank you. Arriving Cartersville about midnight Thursday? - Pete and another man were found. - Why didn't you tell me? - When did you first hear? - About six weeks ago. Harriston came to your uncle... Arriving Cartersville about midnight Thursday. But that's today. Darling, your father's coming home. Yes, yes. That's Pete. That's his signal. How far is it to the airport? Oh, about 10 miles farther on. - What time is it, Parker? - Eleven thirty-five, ma'am. He's over here, this way, towards home. He's gonna land at home like he used to. Come on, Parker. Turn around. He'll land, and we won't be there to meet him. - That can't be nobody except Mr. Pete. - It sure can't. Listen to that engine. You go right on and call the airplane station... ...and tell Miss Maggie to come right smack home. You go right on and stand... Be standing by. - Maggie. - Take it easy, Pete. Mr. Pete, Mr. Pete. The next thing I expects to hear is the angel Gabriel blowing his horn. Good evening, Violet, where are they? Good evening. They is at the airplane station. They reckoned you was landing there. Jefferson, he's telephoning. Home. This is your home, Mr. Pete. This is where you belong. Hear that, Mr. Pete? Hear that welcome for you? - That's him, isn't it? - Who else? Well... Well, I think I'll wait here till his mother gets here. Hey, you don't think he's having any trouble, do you? You think he's all right? Well, I better go see. Come on, Mr. Pete. I knows what you want. You want to get up and say howdy to your pappy. You ain't no poor, little orphan no more. You has got a pappy just like any other little boy. Hold his little head. There. There he is, Mr. Pete. The sweetest little lamb that ever drew the breath of life. - Where is he? - He's upstairs. Oh, Pete. What about that? Oh, yes. What's his name? We call him "Young Pete." Do you like him? He's lovely. Darling, you look ill. Oh, no. I'm all right. Really. - Tell me, are you all right? - Of course I'm all right. Oh, Maggie... ...do you think I've changed? Oh, the grey hair. - A sober, solid citizen, remember? - Yes. Maggie... ...let me look at you to see if you've changed. Have I? No. Nothing was the same without you. Nothing. He's like me. Young Pete, oh, yes. How old is he? Three months and four days exactly. Our son. Yes. Our son. He was all I had of you. Except so often, I had the feeling you were here. Laughing at me and chasing me... ...and roaming around in that silly little plane. Yes, but, Maggie, I'm here now. But you know what? It still seems like I'm seeing you through a mist. Jungles and dark woods. But, darling, you're here. You've come home. Did she really wanna go up and take that baby with her? No, she wanted to hold the plane on the ground. Says it's bad for his ears. Don't you ever let me catch you taking that baby up ever. No, ma'am. But ever is a long time. Isn't it, Petie? Topsy-turvy like you. "Out with the boys." Now, really. Violet, you're spoiling the show. There's only one show going on now and that's that baby going to his bed. Violet's right, Pete. Do you know what time it is? - Anyway, that's bad for his eyes, darling. - The plane is bad for his ears. Movies are bad for his eyes. It'll be tough on his feet. - What? - When he learns to walk. Mr. Pete, can I trouble you for this bundle? Very good. Sleep well. Oh, would you like a nightcap before you turn in? - Now, kiss your mammy. - Good night, darling. - And wave bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Yeah, he's going with Violet. Violet's gonna put him to bed. You know, Maggie, nobody but you could have such a lovely baby. Oh, he'd be a perfect baby no matter who his mother was. Why can't we take him with us to New York tomorrow? Pete, you're insane. But he'd like New York. How do you know? He told me he would. You're absolutely mad. - He's a marvelous boy. - Oh, yeah. You know, I have dozens of these. If you really enjoy looking at them... ...I could send you 50 to Washington if you send them back. - He'll send you 150 if you want. - Your Coke, sir. - Oh, thank you. - Coke, my eye. - That's a Cuba libre. - Do you mind? No, darling, we're on a spree. But don't forget, I'm right here beside you. - First time in New York since I got back. - It's a celebration. - Who is it? - Guess. I don't know. Pete, darling. What does one say to a ghost? Hello, Maggie. I couldn't believe it when I heard you were alive. It was in Australia before a concert. I drank champagne... ...and played Chopin's "Funeral March" in swing time, actually. - Have a drink? - No, thanks. - Colonel Harriston, Miss Kovak. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Staying in town long? No, we're going home tomorrow. - Running away so soon? - We've been here a week. - I do miss the country. - That's what she says. Don't believe her. She's just dying to get back to her boy. She hates being away from him. I've got something to show you. - Here. - Oh, pictures. Oh, I'd love them. That's the son and heir. What do you think of him? Why, he's so big. He's 31 inches tall, weighs 29 pounds, has eight teeth and he bites. And if you don't believe me, just ask that puppy there. Oh, he's lovely. And here. Here's one taken with his mother. I think he looks like Maggie. But she will have it that he looks like me. He is like you. - Oh, but he has Maggie's smile. - Perhaps. I don't know much about babies. Well, I must go. You're both looking so well. That must have been quite a moment... ...when you told Pete about the baby. I'd like to have been there. Well, that's what I call a striking woman. Mister and Missis... Come on. Here you go. Here. Jefferson, take them. Come on, Mister and Missis, get your supper with the rest of them. Well, here I am. Yes, I was expecting you. - Going to ask me to stay? - No. - You'd better. - Maggie. Maggie. Maggie. Pete. - Why, Sandra. - Hello, darling. How are you? What are you doing here? I hardly know myself. I was motoring to White Sulphur Springs. I realized I'd gone through to Maryland... ...that you lived in Maryland, and here I am. I hope I'm not intruding. Of course not. Would you like some tea? - I'd rather have a drink. - Good. - Gee, Sandra, you're looking fine. - I feel well. A little tired. Oh, I love this place. Yes, I must show it to you. I was wondering, could you put me up for the night? I was going to White Sulphur for a rest anyway. I've had a tough season. Why, yes, I suppose we could. Couldn't we, Maggie? Why, yes. Oh, that would be lovely. Thanks. How much ground have you got here? Oh, about 20 acres. You see, we're still sort of doing the house over. Maggie used the other wing. This part of the house used to be shut off. I see. And when the family expanded, the house went with it. That addition, let me tell you, is something. I can hardly wait to see it. It? It's a him. Oh, that's right. It was a boy, wasn't it? - What would you like to drink, Sandra? - I don't know. - Mint julep? - Lovely. - What are you drinking? - The same. Three mint juleps, nice and cold and frosty. Yes, sir, Mr. Pete. I'm dying to see that baby. - Could we go up now? - Of course you can. Pete, it's time for his bath. - I know. - Can't I see him in his bath? Why, certainly. Come on. Isn't the proud mama coming? Oh, here he is. Oh, he's got company. - Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening. Lady come to see you. - Has he had his bath? - Yes, ma'am. Now take your little bow the way Violet taught you. He's kind of shy of strangers. He's got to get over that now. Let me have him, Violet. - Go to your pappy. - Come on now. - There. - Now, no more nonsense. Now, go on bow for the lady. There, that's it. That's a good boy. Now you go to your mother. - What do you think of him? - Oh, I like him. - What's that? - He always likes his little tune... ...before he goes to sleep. Oh, musical? Where do I sleep? In the south room. Jefferson will light the fire. I'll show you. Maggie likes to stay and tuck him in. Shall we have that drink first, Pete? They's nice and frosty, Mr. Pete. Coming right down, Jefferson. Pete. Come on. Our drinks are waiting. Hey, aren't you dressed yet? Oh, are we dressing? Well, I thought you'd want to. We have a guest. - What's the matter? You got a headache? - No. Well, then you better hurry. It's almost 7:00. All right. Harriett won't leave New York even in the winter. She was a good sort. Didn't she lose money? No, that's the story she tells. Fuzzy left her a lot. - Did Fuzzy die? - No, he gave her a lot. He's in a home for inebriates, someplace in New Jersey. Hello, darling. You're late. - We've already had three. - Three? Oh, Maggie, that wifely tone. Do you count his cigarettes too? It's doctor's orders. Doctor's orders. How familiar that sounds. Would you believe it? I was under doctor's orders. You? Yes. I had to count my cigarettes, my drinks and my calories. I had a little dragon watching over me every minute to see that I did it. It didn't seem to do you any harm. No, I have never seen you look more blooming. - Come on. Have another one. - Why, I shouldn't. But how I love to do things I shouldn't. To my hostess. Maggie, my dear, may you always be as happy as you are now. Dinner's served. You always were a traveler. You would love Australia, Pete. It's a great man's country. Earthy and exciting. Reminds me of our own West. You know, Arizona. Arizona? That's where Young Pete was born. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Not here in the ancestral home? - No. That's when I was missing. Pretty grim for Maggie. No wonder she wanted to get away from people. Mr. Pete, you're wanted on the telephone. Long distance. Oh, excuse me, ladies. Jefferson, we'll have our coffee in the drawing room. Oh, I'll take my brandy with me. Put the coffee there. What are you going to do? - What are you going to do? - Nothing. - You're going to hold me to my bargain? - Yes. When I made it, I didn't know Pete was alive. When you thought he was dead, you didn't want that child. Now he's alive, you want both. It was never a part of the bargain that Pete should be alive. The money you gave me is in trust. It's never been touched. You're not going to tell Pete. No, Maggie. I'm not going to tell him. You're going to tell him. And I'm gonna stay here until you do. Well, that's that. Harriston has new planes that he wants me to see. I think I'm gonna say good night. I won't have any coffee. It might keep me awake. I want sleep. - Sleep? You're not turning in now? - Maggie looks a little tired. Are you, Maggie? It's so early. I won't go to bed right away. I'll read and write letters. Open the windows and get some of your good country air. - You've got luncheon guests tomorrow. - Yes. Then I think you've had quite enough for one evening. - Good night and try and get some rest. - Good night, Sandra. Oh, don't bother, Maggie. I can find my way. Good night, Sandra. Coffee? What's going on between you two? - Nothing. - Well, something must have happened. Did Sandra say anything to upset you? No, she didn't. Well, then, my darling, don't you think you've let me down a little? How? Well, I don't know why Sandra came here. But I'm sure she came here for some reason. And I particularly wanted her to see how happy we are. We are happy, aren't we? Of course. Then don't you think you could have taken some other way of showing it? You hardly ate. You hardly spoke. Anyone would think that I beat you in private. I'm sorry. Maggie, there's something between us tonight. I don't know what it is but it's like flying in a fog. I can't seem to get my bearings and I don't like it. We've always told each other everything, haven't we? That's been the great thing. No secrets. Always honest with each other, haven't we? Well, then don't you think you can tell me what's making you unhappy? Maggie, I think I know what it is. It's Sandra. Her being here is what upset you, hasn't it? And you think that... Well, that I still find her attractive, don't you? Do you? I'd be lying to you if I said anything else. Any man would find Sandra attractive. Perhaps even a little exciting. But you see, Maggie, I'm not just any man now. I'm your husband. The father of Young Pete. And believe me, that makes a whale of a difference. You and Young Pete. You'd have to be a man to know what that means. But it's the tops. What time is it, Violet? I didn't get to sleep till early this morning. It's 10:00. I've laid your clothes out. That wretched lunch. What am I going to do? The first thing you'll do is drink your coffee. Ain't nobody coming for an hour. And me and Jefferson done got everything under control. Well, give them their mint juleps when they arrive. And then smoked turkey and Virginia ham... ...and then all the hot dishes out on the buffet. I don't want anything to go wrong, Violet. Oh, is Kovak up yet? Her? Laws, yes. She was up with the birds. Had breakfast and then come to the nursery and took the baby. Where? What's the matter with you this morning? You're as white as the tablecloth. She just took him for a little walk. They is down on the lawn. - He's not a bit afraid, is he? - No. No. You're not afraid, are you? All right. - Good morning, Maggie. - Good morning. Hello, sleepy head. Hello. I'm sorry I slept so late. I'm getting dressed now. Take your time. I'm getting acquainted with this young man. He's a darling. Yes, isn't he? I'm thinking of stealing him. You better not try it. Here, Miss Maggie. Pete. - Pete. - Maggie. I've changed my mind since last night. If you think I'll stand by... ...let Pete think that child is yours and say nothing, you're crazy. Why didn't you tell him the truth when he came back? Why did you lie to him? I didn't lie to him. Pete thinks that child is yours. He is. - What? - I didn't lie to Pete. The child is mine. Your part was finished the minute you gave that baby to me. From that day on, I had only one purpose in my life... ...to make that baby mine and to forget that you ever existed. So you told Pete the baby was yours. What did you think I'd do about that? Oh, I don't know what I thought. That you'd never come back. That perhaps you'd marry and stay away for years. Perhaps you'd die. I hoped you would. But I didn't die and I haven't stayed away and I want that child. Sandra, you walked away from that baby without one backward look. - I've seen him. - You could anytime. We made no rule. I was in Australia. It takes more than an ocean to keep a mother from a child she wants to see. All those months, you never wrote me one line asking about him. You were perfectly satisfied to have him off your hands. Why, if that had been my child, I'd have never given him up. But he's not your child and you're going to give him up. You could justify that lie to yourself but you can't justify it to Pete. He'll never forgive you, Maggie. Oh, you're not going to tell Pete, are you? You see, you're afraid. You don't dare tell him how you've lied to him. I'll tell you something else you're afraid of. You're afraid you'll lose Pete. You will. He never loved you as he loved me. You were second choice. You caught him on the rebound. There's only one thing holding him to you, Maggie, and that's my baby. I'd be too proud to hold a man with another woman's child. Pete... ...come here. - What's the matter? - Sit down. - I've got something to tell you. - Oh, what? I've lied to you about Young Pete. What do you mean? I mean, he isn't mine. - What are you talking about? - He belongs to Sandra. Sandra's his mother. He's mine, Pete. Yours and mine. I'll tell you as simply as I can. When you were in South America before you were missing... ...Sandra told me she was going to have a child. Your child. And then when you didn't come back and we thought you were dead... ...well, it wasn't an easy situation for Sandra to face alone... ...so I went away with her and stayed until Young Pete was born. Then I persuaded her to let me take him. It was the only way he could have the place in life he was entitled to. He was your son. So Sandra gave him up... ...so he could have that place. Wait a minute. That's why you went to Arizona alone. That's why you didn't take Violet or Aunt Ada with you. - Yes. - Yes. I thought there was something funny. You were always so shy about taking the credit for Young Pete. And I remember you saying once: "No matter who the mother is, the baby would be perfect." Yeah. At the time, I thought that was rather sweet. I liked it. And you, Sandra. Ever since you've been in this house... ...you've been hammering sarcastically at Maggie about that baby. The "proud mother" business. I thought there was something. - Pete, don't you see that...? - Yeah. You told everyone that the baby was yours. You lied to everyone. When I came back, you even lied to me. How long did you intend to go on lying, Maggie? Well, I couldn't bear the thought of losing either of you. Well, why are you telling me now? Because now Sandra wants the baby. - You're gonna take the baby away? - He's mine, Pete. When I gave him up, I didn't know you were still alive. - It's different now. - How is it different now? Sandra just told me that I was only holding you because of Young Pete. Her child. And that if you knew I'd lied to you, you... Well, you'd leave me. Stop. Stop it. - Haven't you any sense? - Oh, but... Shut up. Don't act like a crybaby. Well, Sandra... ...the baby is yours. If you want to take him... ...there isn't very much I can do about it. He's a fine little chap... ...and we'll miss him, naturally. Maggie... ...thank heaven we've got each other. Oh, yes. Here they is. Your mammy and your pappy. The company is almost here. It's time for this little rascal to have his nap. Now kiss your mammy. And your pappy. And wave bye-bye to the lady. And come on with Violet, honey child, to your little bed. Yeah. I wonder if I could have a drink. Oh, of course. Maggie, I'm not staying for lunch. What about Young Pete? I'm leaving him with his mother. Come on. If you look like that, people will think I beat you. If you don't stop, I will. Now, come on.
