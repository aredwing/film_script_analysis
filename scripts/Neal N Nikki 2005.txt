But now, he rears horses! After settling in Canada, Dad brought Mom from Punjab. The result of their 25 years of hard work is not me it's Albert, their horse! You go gaga when you see pretty women, You forget all about me! I make the tea, I cook the meals. And they get the kisses? What rubbish! When did you cook meals for the horse? Come on! Let's take a picture! Don't touch me! Mom and Dad are very cute. They can't stay without each other. And when they're together, they're always fighting! Unfortunately, both of them are very happy! And now they want to see me happy. They want me to get married! Me! The Neal! Don't get me wrong.. I don't have a problem with girls, they love me! Neal! He rocks, and he's the one to score! You thought you've seen the best, but he's here to show you more! N E A L! GO Neal! They tell the whole world, that they're crazy about me! I'm kidding. Girls aren't that crazy! It's not that I don't want to get married. But you need to choose the right kind of girl, not this domesticated, homely type, you know! I've told Mom, I'm the athletic type I like football. Then I have the perfect girl, she's also very sporty and athletic". ..just like you! Hi! I'm Minni! Wanna play? If I don't have any kids in the future.. ..it's all thanks to Minni! Neal, look who's here! Your Daddy's best friend, Harpreet Uncle.. and Cherry Aunty, and their daughter Katrina! Niiiice! Hello! Hello! - How you doing? Ok, what's wrong with her? She's pretty.. forget pretty, she's hot! What are you saying Neal? Mom and Dad actually got it right? Damn, I wish this was as simple as buying a car. Actually, when buying a car, you can test drive it. You can check how to handle it, its power, it's smoothness Can it handle curves? Did you say something? Would you like to go for a drive? I'd love to - Great! Harpreet come! Let me show you my horse! He's won all possible awards! He's so proud of him, he praises him in every word he utters! Why shouldn't I be? You can recognize his breeding in everything he does! He lives up to the Punjabi name! You go girl! What happened? It's a little big, but there's no need to be worried! What? - Mummy. Oh my God! Hello! Meet Gyaniji! His job is to impart wisdom, but its only me that he imparts it to, And I am forced to listen to it because in our house.. ..Gyaniji's place comes right after "Babaji's. Half of Mom's sentences start with "Gyaniji was saying. I was saying there is no need to worry. And this is Gyaniji's son, Happy. Samar with a Guitar, who wants to be a Rockstar.! Gyaniji, what should I do? Start the marriage preparations, the girl for Neal, will come from Bhatinda. "A pretty girl from Bhatinda.." " ..dressed in pink attire.." " ..and silver sequined shoes." "The cadence of her flowing tresses.." "..makes the fields go wild with gushes." "She's loved by God." "She's loved by all!" "Her face is sweet, her soul is sweet!" "Everyone calls her Sweety!" "Everyone calls her Sweety!" Neal, what're you doing? I can't believe you're getting married! Why did I give you so much advice? Marriage is not a good thing. Do we look like happy guys? Look what his wife has done to him.. ..he's got to wear tight clothes all the time! As soon as I got married my life was over. After this you're pretty much done. How could you say yes for the wedding? A girl from Bhatinda? You haven't even met her! Stop panicking guys, Relax. I decided a long time ago that I will have an arranged marriage. Why? Have you seen my girlfriends? Will you marry any one of them? It's simple dude! I don't trust my choice in women! That's why I said yes to marry Sweety! Dad in a few clays I'll be married and my life will change forever. And then you know what's going to happen next. I want to spend the remaining 21 days in Vancouver. You know, big city, lots of fun. Dad, I just want to have some fun. Neal, why do you think married guys don't have fun? Dad, are you having fun? - Go son, go! You sure? - Sure. Dad, ya? - Ya! Hello Vancouver!!

"I want to party harder, searching for romance." "O' God, this guy is so lovelorn." "Gosh! He fails to understand this norm." "That it takes time for the hearts to grow fond." "Love takes time to bond." "God, this guy is so lovelorn." "Gosh! He fails to understand this norm." "And when I meet my baby." "Shes going to drive me crazy." "Dont know what I would do that would get me high and hazy." "This is the city where I'm gonna get some action." "Just wanna have some fun, get some satisfaction."

I dont know if youre feeling the same way or not? This feels so right. No you feel right. Last night felt so right. Neal youve lost it! Youre talking about Nikki. The same girl who went crazy about her ex-boyfriend.. ..the same girl who wanted to cut off your... Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning? Whats the meaning of good morning? Nikki, good morning means that last night was.. ..nothing for him. You were just another girl. Idiot why did you say good morning like that? Ok turn around, hold her, and tell her.. .. how wonderful this morning really is. Why did she get up? Ok before she goes somewhere talk to her! It's a nice clay isn't it? I dont believe this, now were going to talk.. ..about the weather? How predictable, who wants to talk about last night? No one! Would you like some coffee? Coffeel? What I would like to know is how were you.. ...last night, Mister Know It All? What I would like to know is am I one of.. ..those girls you came to Vancouver for? What I would like to know is why are you asking me for coffee? Coffee would be fine! Coffeel? Why did I ask her for coffee? I dont even know how to make coffee! I wonder why I didnt meet you earlier? I think that.. - Dont even think that! If you think that I am going to drink that coffee.. ..you must be crazy! Look at her. She will be the perfect wife. Mom will also like her. Actually mom wont like her at all, but who cares? Nikki.. I want to say something I knew this was coming, next hell say Nikki youre very sweet and last night was very special but... Nikki youre very sweet and last night was very special... Nikki hes about to dump you, just like Trish! Dont let him do it. before he dumps you, dump him! Neal I know what youre going to say. What happened last night, happens only with few people. Wow Neal! You and Nikki think alike! This is the perfect moment. Propose to her! Tell her you want to marry her. Oh God, how pathetic! Whats he doing on his knees? Will he beg? Will he ask me not to tell anyone? Will he tell me not to expect anything from him? Before he hurts you, dump him! It's ok, get up. You can forget about last night. It didnt mean a thing. Lets move on, shall we? Do you want me to drive? No Why, do you want to drive? No Do you want me to drive? No. Good! - Good! Great! Did you want to listen? No. Good Why have we stopped? Guys, can we, can we please get a ride to Vancouver? - Please? Weve been walking on this road for so long. And, and we just really need to get back. I mean, were going to lose our jobs if we dont. Please. Can we please get a ride? Get in. Can I turn the radio on? Look whats he doing, hes touching.. ..the poor thing all over. Hes doing it with her permission.. ..and she seems to be enjoying it. I knew the moment I saw him that he is a scoundrel! It could also be the other way around, she could be playing him It could also be that he will take advantage of her and then leave her! If she wants she can stop him.. ..but its fairly obvious that she doesnt want to. I knew you would think like that! You guys are all the same. After you get what you want youre gone! It's not always our fault! She must have brought.. ...the poor guy here by blinding him with.. ..her sweet talk so she can have a good time. She probably has an ex-boyfriend who dumped her.. ..and now shes using this guy to get even with him. Get out! Nikki? Nikki? What are you doing? Nikki? Whats wrong with you? I'm saying goodbye! Last night was the biggest mistake of my life. Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki listen to me, Nikki... And now youre the idiot who I have to remember for the rest of my life. Get out! Get out!
