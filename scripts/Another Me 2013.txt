But your world hadn't even started to end until last summer. Up until then, you'd had a perfect childhood. Not a worry in the world. Not a care in your heart, not a stain in sight. Do you remember? Do you remember what it felt like? Mom and Dad still so in love. You, their beloved daughter. Oh, ! ime gusta, me gusta! I'm 15! I don't want to see that. Oh, grow up! Until that moment... on the balcony, when everything changed. When Dad's hands started to tremble. And he said in full daylight, how strange it's dark. That was the end of your perfect childhood. It's multiple sclerosis. It's funny. The grief is making me strong. But it's making you weak. I've waited so long. But the time is close now. The time for me to come. With no one there to stop me. You will disappear. And no one will know it. Hey, baby. Thank you. Excuse me. Okay. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Let's try that again. Good afternoon, John. Good afternoon. Lovely to see y'all. I'm delighted to see so many of you turned up after last week's insalubrious auditions. But, hey, you'd do anything to get out of maths class, wouldn't you? Ah, you would, wouldn't you? Right. Without further ado. Macbeth... Drew Fraser. Your new neighbor. Thank you. Dan Jones, his understudy. Well done, Dan. Gus Philips... you will play Duncan. Peter Lane will play Banquo. Now... the most important character in the Scottish tragedy. Who's going to be that cruel, insidious, beautiful queen? Fay Delussey... why don't you come join us? Now, Fay, come on. Her understudy will be Monica Meldrum. It's okay, you can smile, Monica. It's allowed. Sara Simpson... Lady Macduff. You're gonna have to rehearse with Drew, like, every day. Don't even get me started. Don't look so smug, Delussey. You do know why you got that part, don't you? Uh, raw talent? Talent, my ass. He just feels sorry for you. That's all. You got a pity part. Everybody here feels sorry for you because your father's dying. Don't listen to a word of what that loser says. Yeah, totally. She's just jealous. Are you sure you're all right, babes? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. You swear? Honest. Anyway, I'll see you guys later. Okay, bye. Bye! Bye. Bye. Bye, chicken. Nice! Hey! Drew, what the hell? You look like you've seen a ghost. Don't do that. Sorry. Nice pictures. Thanks. I got to run. I'm later already. Okay. Bye. A man has been arrested in connection with the abduction and suspected murder of a teenage girl... Fay. I didn't hear you come in. How are you? The fog's awful. Yeah, it's bad, isn't it? Probably why Mom's late. Yeah, probably. How was your day? I got the main part in the school play, so... Oh, well done. That's wonderful. Your mum will be thrilled. ...on the night the victim went missing. The victim has been staying with her aunt... Ah. ...and had left the residence... It's terrible, isn't it? Not much older than you. Promise me you'll be careful, darling... Oh, Dad, don't be such a nutter. I just want you to be safe. Okay? Hey. Fay. What is it? Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing, honest. You can always talk to me, love. - I couldn't get a bus. - Okay? I'm not going anywhere soon. I had to walk back. Almost got lost. How are you, darlings? Fine, yeah. Good. Yeah? Fay? Yeah, all right. Well, um... how was school? Tell Mum your news. You tell her. Faces In the fog Howl at the moon Like a dog And you You haunt me Oh, you Haunt me You can't hide from your fears, however hard you try. I've waited so long. And you Haunt me So long. You haunt me. Good morning, Mrs. Brennan. Morning, Mrs. Delussey. Fay. Hi. Everything all right? Oh, yes. Yes. Such a wonderful head of hair. Oh. You'd never think I had hair as lovely as that. Oh, no! Not again! This lift is always the one to break down, ever the even one. Can you explain me that? They were both put in at the same time. Strange. Kill someone someday. It's a hazard. I'll have to get in touch with that lazy landlord. Ah! Mustn't be late for school. Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine. Yes, but she was quite right yesterday to take the stairs. She's got young legs. She should use them. I took the lift yesterday, Mrs. Brennan. Don't be daft. Yesterday, I saw you going down the stairs. Plain as day. Seriously, I haven't used the stairs since we moved in. Bye, Mrs. Brennan. Bye, now. Bye, love. 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell... Um... Dwell in doubtful... Okay. Okay, stop. It's okay. Fay... I need you to relax. Okay? Just take a breath. 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. Okay? Try again. 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell... In doubtful joy. Dwell in doubtful joy. I'm sorry. I can't concentrate. I've learned it, but, um... Monica. Look, today's the first day of rehearsal. I want everybody to note that. This is the first day of rehearsals. No one's going to criticize you. I'm certainly not going to judge you. And no one's paying for this. Okay. In the staff room, there's a DVD of Roman Polanski's version of Macbeth. Francesca Annis gives a brilliant performance in it. I want you to go take a look at it, okay? I'll go get it now, shall I? Great. And, Fay, relax. Meanwhile... Um, let me see. Andrew. Center stage, please. Hello? Is someone in here? Help, someone, help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! Somebody help me! What's wrong? Why are you screaming? Someone was coming after me. Well, who was it? I don't know. What the hell? Who's been tampering with my lights? I didn't touch your lights. Someone was coming after me. Why was someone following you? I don't know. They were coming. Are you sure this wasn't just, like, your imagination or... It was not my imagination. Someone was running after me. You causing a scene, Fay? What, the main part not enough limelight for you? Yeah, look, come on, enough fun and games, now, yeah? Go home, now. Go home. All right, guys, let's get out of here. When did Monica leave the rehearsal? She left after you did. You think it was her? Well, Lady Macbeth, I never thought you'd take method acting so seriously. Piss off, Drew, it's not funny. Monica Meldrum is totally trying to screw with my head. Yeah, and succeeding, by the look of things. Jesus, relax. Sorry. Want me to walk you home? Mum's coming to pick me up. All right, well, I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow, then. Bye. Bye. How was school? How did the rehearsal go? Oh, great. Yeah, it was brilliant. I totally nailed it. In fact, everything's brilliant. Almost too good to be true. I feel like I'm living in paradise. Let us suppose that Y minus four equals 41. Who can tell me the value of Y? Fay? Fay Delussey? Yeah? What? At the same time, as soon as Lady Macbeth hears that Duncan's coming under her battlements, as soon as you hear he's coming, your plan starts in your head. The mechanics start working, yeah? Yeah. Should we try it? Okay. My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight. And when goes hence? Tomorrow as he purposes. Oh, never shall sun that morrow see. Okay, you just remember. He's just seen Malcolm... Three pounds. Seriously! You know, I bet the scales are rigged to keep you coming back. I knew I shouldn't have refreshed my lipstick before the weigh-in... Oh, come on! I starved myself all week. Good night, Mira. Bye. Bye. You all right, Fay? Has that been fixed already? Yeah, I think so. It just went up, so... I wouldn't trust it, yeah? Could swear they said it would take a few days. Take this one. Oh! Sorry, too late. Hey, come on! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Fay? Fay, is that you? Yes, Mrs. Brennan, it's me. What are the noises? Just the lift. You didn't come up in the bad one, did you? No, Mrs. Brennan, I took the other one. Night, Mrs. Brennan. Good night. Fay? Ann? What, darling? Was that Fay who came in now? I worry about her. She's-she's a teenager. She needs space. Don't fuss so much. Hadn't you arranged to meet your, um... your girlfriends tonight? Yeah. Well, go. Please. Just go. I don't have to go. I mean, I'm-I'm really happy to stay... Just... just go out. Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were in here. Mmm. I'm almost done. I'm almost done. Going out? Yeah. Yeah, with the girls. There's some, um... some lasagna in the oven. Fay! Fay! What's wrong? You okay? What are you doing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. What are you doing? You okay? Uh, yeah, no. I was just, um... doing my homework. Okay. Okay. Come sit down with me. Come on. You can stop this now. You were in full view of everyone. Bye, Dad. Bye, love. Where's Mum? She went to work ages ago. But I just heard you talking with her. She was crying. It was the radio. Radio was on. Oh. Oh, okay. Bye. Bye. Hey. Hi. You learned your lines? Most. You? Uh, same, yeah. The end of act two's impossible. Tell me about it. This is the very painting of your fear. This is... the dagger. Okay, stop. Guys, what's happening? Fay, you need to turn Macbeth. You need to be the hand that guides the sword. Do you understand what I'm saying? I want you to do that one more time. Monica, pay attention to this, okay? So let's set it up again. Morning, Mrs. Brennan. What? Are you playing games with me? Sorry? Just a minute ago, I just saw you walking down the stairs. Don't play games with me! This is not Gaslight. What's go...? Mrs. Brennan, I just came out my flat. I may be old, but I'm all right up here, so you can go and play your silly little games on someone else. Gaslight! Wait! Who are you? Why are you doing this to me? Wait! Who are you? Why are you doing this to me? Stop! Stop! Did you see her? See who? A girl, like me, coming out of here. No one's come out. You must have seen her. She must have run past you. No one's come out. Mrs. Brennan, that wasn't me you saw up there. That was somebody else. Of course it was you. I'd never mistake that beautiful hair. What have you got now? Um, science. Oh, okay. What on earth have you done to your hair? Oh, my God. Fay, have you looked in the mirror? Look, I-I saw her. I-I almost saw her, almost caught her. Mrs. Brennan saw her, or spoke to her, even thought she was me. You saw who? Rewind. Back up, you nutcase. Do you want to tell us what the hell is going on? Me. Someone who looks like me. Someone... What's happening to you, Fay? Someone's pretending to be me, and it's totally messing with my head. Why would someone do that? Oh, God knows. It's total psycho stalking stuff. You don't think it's Monica Meldrum? She's everywhere. She's all over the place. I just couldn't believe that Monica... Fay? Head teacher's office, please. Fay! Fay, your hair... what happened? Fay?! Do you think that this isn't difficult enough without you acting like a lunatic? Do you really... do you really think this is what your father needs right now? Just... tell me what's going on, Fay. Maybe I can help you. There's someone... out there making out... she's me. Like with Mrs. Brennan in the lift. At school, the other night. By the car outside. It's-it's like I've got a twin or something. Whoever she is, is identical to me. Oh, my... Mum, you're freaking me out. You were a twin. You were an identical twin. There were complications when I was pregnant, and I-I... I lost her. Oh, we had you. Did you bury her? Yeah. St. Stephen's Church. Layla. We called her Layla Delussey. The first Noel The angel did say Was to certain poor shepherds In fields as they lay In fields where they Lay keeping their sheep On a cold winter's night That was so deep Noel, Noel Noel, Noel... Ta-da! Wow. You like it? It's knockout. It really suits you. Look at you all grown up. Come here, give me a hug. Come here. Come here. It's only a haircut, Dad. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh, my baby. Now, you be happy, be safe. And be strong. Everything will be okay if you're strong. Hmm? Yeah? And don't you be sad because of me. It'll make you weak. I can't protect you for much longer. Dad, please. I'm sorry. I wish you hadn't kept Layla a secret from me. I know. Your mum tells me how upset you are. I'm sorry. I wish she hadn't died, Dad. Me, too. Me, too. Here she is. Oh, my God. That is so cool. Wow, Fay. And very fancy. Makeover time. Mmm. Fay. I hardly recognized you. He's so got your number. I don't know. This is the very painting of your fear. This... This is the very painting of your fear. This is the air-drawn dagger which you said led you to Duncan. Oh, these flaws and starts, impostors to true fear, would well become a woman's story at a winter's fire authorized by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all is done, you look but on a stool. Have fun! There you go. That one's yours. Thank you. Be careful. It's hot. Okay, yeah. So, uh... any word from your evil twin? I mean, the look-alike you've been talking about. Shit. What? My mum told me yesterday I had an identical twin that died before I was born. I'm sorry. I wouldn't... No, that's fine. It's... it's just a bit weird and sad. Yeah, I bet. My mum reckons my dad... being sick made me remember my twin, like, unconsciously. She thinks one grief can unlock another. Whatever that means. That's deep. I reckon she's read one too many self-help books. I don't know. Now I know about it... I feel like I miss her. But, really, I've always missed her, just never known it was her that I missed. I don't like seeing you sad. I know. Oh, I hate the fog. It's so spooky. Oh, scaredy-cat. Don't worry, I'll protect you. Thanks, but I definitely don't need protecting. Okay. You changed your hair. What about it? I don't know. You look like a different person. What, and you don't like me looking like a different person? No. It's nice. Okay, well, I've got to... Yeah. Go now. So... Um, I'll see you tomorrow? Uh, yeah. Great. Cool. Night. I'm home. Dad? Fay. Are you all right? I'm fine, I'm fine. What happened? Oh, I... I must have fallen asleep reading my book or something. I don't know. Well, are you all right? I'm fine, I'm fine. Don't you worry about me. That's it. Pull me up. You nearly gave me a heart attack. You're too young for a heart attack. Here you go. Thank you. Fay. You don't want to look at that. Oh, my God. Put it down, Fay. Fay. My love. Fay. F... - Good morning, Miles. - Good morning, Vincent. Behaving yourselves? I doubt it. Hey, just the girl I wanted to see. I'm late. Hey, listen, I just wanted to say that I've stolen a few hours from your English class for rehearsals. Hey! Come back. I waved at you this morning in the playground. You just ignored me. Why didn't you wave back at me? What's the problem? I came in through the street entrance. I haven't been in the playground this morning. Maybe it was, uh... maybe it was Monica. I don't know. I just... Look, I was out last night. Bit of a hangover. Maybe it was just me. Take care, Fay. - "Look at me. I'm Fay. - Please notice me. I'll do anything to attract attention." You! It's been you all along, you little bitch! You think you can mess with my head? Fay! What are you doing? Go on, Fay! You psycho! Stop, Fay. You mess with me again, I swear I'll kill you! Get off! Fay, please! Come on! Fay! Fay, come on. Calm down. What is going on? Relax. She's a psycho. Monica Meldrum is impersonating me. She keeps pretending to be me. Why on earth would she go to all that trouble? I don't know. Because I got the main part in the school play and she wanted it. I mean, she even said I only got it because my dad's dying. Why would Monica say something... Because she's insane. It's not me. Don't you see? This is what she wants. Okay, if she really is trying to impersonate you, just ignore her and she'll soon get tired of it. How can I ignore her? This morning she came in through the playground and a teacher actually mistook her for me. Okay, Fay, I don't know about anything else, but this morning she was not in the playground pretending to be you. She got in early through the street entrance for school council... I can vouch for that myself. There's nothing I can do. I have to call your parents. Well, at least from now on you'll be able to tell us apart. I'm doing what I can, but... it's a delicate area. You're gonna have quite a scar. I hope so. Do you remember when we used to come here? You always insisted on a Lion King balloon. And then you'd hold on to it for two minutes, and... you'd let it go. I liked to see it fly away. I wish everything could just be the way it was back then. You, me. Your dad. I'd do anything for you, Fay. Anything. I would. I really would. Stop seeing my... Stop seeing him, then. What? Don't deny it, please. I don't know what you... Is that why I got the main part? No! No, no, of course not. How could you, Mum? No. I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for it to happen. I just... You-you just couldn't help yourself? It's been a... been a difficult... Couldn't you have waited? I'm sorry. Life's not always as... simple as you want it to be. It's as simple as you make it. All right, I'll end it. I promise. Fay? Yeah? Darling, Drew's here. He's come to say hello. Oh. Um... Yeah, no, send him in. Hi. I, um... I wanted to see if you're all right. Oh. Yeah. Fine. Did you take these? Yeah. That's really cool. God, is that you and your twin? It's really beautiful. So, does it hurt? Oh, not much. Everyone thinks I'm crazy, right? No. No, not at all. In fact, actually, I think they were planning on giving you the Most Uncrazy Teen of the Year award. I don't know. Maybe I am. I don't know what to believe anymore. It turns out it wasn't Monica after all. Yeah, I heard you were quite impressive. Let me know next time, and I'll sell tickets. We could make a fortune. Okay, ready? When we get to there, we race. Okay. I'm so slow. "Well, she said, 'Yes, ' we said, 'I do.'" That's so cringe. I think that means they got married. Really? Yeah. Oh, I think so. Well done. Well done, Drew. "Marjorie and Joe Lodge, who loved the pier and the sea." There. It's okay, my love. My girl. My darling. Oh. It's okay. Baskin-Robbins once made a ketchup-flavored ice cream. Ugh. Ugh. Oh, that's just vile. They've got shrimp-flavored ice cream in Japan. Oh. Mmm. Mm-hmm. And seaweed. Horrible. Well, we should get our acts together in about five minutes. Hmm? It's okay. Come here. Get a room. That doesn't look too pretty. I'm-I'm sure that's... Excuse me. I think I know this car. What's going on, Fay? Can I help you? It's Moffat's car. What? You know John Moffat? He's our drama teacher. Is he... Oh, it's a nasty accident. He's in theater at ICU, St. Bernard's. What happened? There was a girl in the road, apparently. She threw a stone through the windscreen, and the driver swerved into the tree. But there's been no sign of anyone. We can't find the girl who did it anywhere. Shit. There was another passenger in the car. Uh, a woman. The paramedics, they sent her home with barely a scratch. Fay, what's going on? My twin did this. She knew. She knew before I did Mum didn't end it. Fay, what are you talking about? What if this other person is like an extension of me? I'm sorry, I've got to go. Mum? I've got a migraine, love. I'm gonna sleep it off. Okay. Okay, love, I'm off to work. Mum? Yeah? Mum. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. You not getting ready for school? Oh, I'm not feeling too good. Could you call me in sick? Sure. I'll see you tonight. So, we'll pick up where we left off yesterday, shall we? That would be act one, scene six. If you remember, they had just arrived at Macbeth's castle. Thanks for the photo. I don't know how you did it, but you look really hot. So, please, Banquo, Macbeth... The photo you put in my locker? Lady Macbeth and Duncan. Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, any time today, thank you. So, the top of page 36. And, Fay, if you can do the couplets with the rhythm you had yesterday, that was brilliant. You mean Monica? I wasn't here yesterday. I was sick. My mum called me in sick. Yes, we did get the call, but no, you were here. We did the whole of act one? I was off sick. Fay, I-I've really tried to be patient with you, but I've really had enough with your dramatics. I wasn't here yesterday! Give it up, Fay. We were all here yesterday. We all saw you. Yeah, exactly. We all saw you. Yeah, thank you, ladies. Now, please go onstage. Fay? Fay? Psycho. Fay! Yeah, that's her. Hey, baby, you want to pick up where we left off yesterday? Get off! Oh, you weren't saying that yesterday. Get your filthy hands off me! Oh, shit! Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What's wrong, darling? What's wrong? I'm losing my mind. I'm going mad. You're not. You're not losing your mind. I am! I am! You don't understand! I am! Shh! Stop it, now. Stop it. You listen to me. You are not losing your mind, okay? You're right. What you think you see, you're seeing. It's Layla. I see her, too. I've always seen her. How can it be? Oh, my love. Your mother was found in the Whitecross Underpass, unconscious. Bleeding. Placental abruption. Common enough, apparently, but they should have picked it up in the scans. I... went straight from work to the hospital, and she was already in the theater. They told me only one of you would survive. And they had to operate immediately, and then... Then I had to sign... ...the papers giving them permission to let one of you go. They told me, if I didn't sign, I could lose all three of you. And, of course, I signed. It felt like a viable trade. One life to save another and... and Ann's. She was so beautiful. Like you. Just like you. The most perfect thing I'd ever seen. Except that she was dead. I never told your mum that I'd signed her execution papers. I couldn't tell her that. It was a guilt I had to bear on my own. Dad. And... ...she's still here. My ghost daughter. With me. Calling in her debt from me. At first, I thought that only I could see her, but I was wrong. She's always been here, in the shadows. As real as any ghost can be. And where is she now? No. Dad, I want to see her. You mustn't see her. It's dangerous. You don't understand. Fay! She's me! I want to see her! You mustn't see her! I'm not enough for her anymore. She wants your life! Don't you understand?! You mustn't look at her, Fay. If you don't look at her, she can't hurt you. It's the only way she can get you. Promise me, Fay. I know. I can stop her, Dad. I know where she'll be. Fay! Fay! Fay, wait! I'm here. I know you're here, too. I'm sorry you died and I lived. I wish you lived, too. But you have to stop punishing us. It wasn't Dad's fault. Where are you? Look at me, Fay. Go on, look at me. I know you can't resist. You have to leave us alone, Layla. Never. Look at me, Fay. Look at me, Fay. Look at me. - He was in such a hurry. - He didn't want to wait, and, of course, he couldn't take the stairs. I tried to tell him the lift is broken, but he wouldn't listen. No? Okay. I tried to tell him to take the even lift. That one works. That one has always worked. I told that lazy landlord a thousand times. I knew that lift would kill someone one day. That landlord is a murderer! Fay! Fay, wait! Wait for me! Fay! Hey. You all right? Yeah, I'm good. I'm sorry... about not being there for you. Look, forget about it. My head was totally mashed with my dad and stuff, so... Of course. I'm sorry anyway. See you in the wings. See you in the wings. Your father would be so proud of you. Are you ready? I'm ready. You will disappear, and no one will know it. Faces In the fog Howl at the moon Like a dog And you You haunt me Oh, you Haunt me Cracks in the mirror On the wall Dust clings to light In the hall And you You haunt me Oh, you Haunt me Silhouettes framed in smoke And blinding light My hands sweat and shake So much tonight And you You haunt me Oh, you Haunt me You haunt me.
