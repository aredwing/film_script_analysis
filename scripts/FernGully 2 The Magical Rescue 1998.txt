Come on, Wal, one more time. Bandy, you're next. The reason the forest is cool and green below... It's all right. It's just those Beetle Boys up to their tricks again. The canopy keeps us safe from the harsh rays of the sun... Hey, Stump, what are we gonna do today? Duh, what are we doing today, Pips? Well, let's see. We could... Ah, who knows? Same as yesterday, I guess. Same as any old day in the forest. I thought you liked FernGully, Pips. Yeah, FernGully is the most beautiful place I know. But let's face it, boys, it's the only place I know. And I get tired of it sometimes. We can keep dry, hiding underneath leaves. We can keep ourselves safe, hiding inside of trees. Down. Oh, you need some water. Oh! Hey... Pips! Whoa! Nice of you to drop in, Pips. I know you can't resist a gardening lesson. - Cor! - Wow! Down here, Miss Smarty-pants. Let the legend show you how to do it. - Way to go, Pips. - Beat that, Crysta. Magi Lune taught me that magic is too precious to waste on silly games. Ah... Oh... Well... just this once, then. Oh, yeah. Real impressive. - Go on, Crysta. - Yeah, show him. Wow! Whoa! Just what we need - another tree. Big deal. The forest is full of them. Personally, I'd like to see something new. Come on, boys. Hey! Wow... She grew a tree. A whole tree. You can try one too, Bark. But remember- magic is not just for fun and games. I'll remember. Oh... You'll learn to do it someday, Bark. Watch. I'll show you how to start a sprout. Don't waste your time on that boring stuff, Bark. Come on, boys. Let's go find a little action. Emergency! Incoming! - Run for your lives! - Did you hear that, Pips? They're coming. Women and bats first! Out of my way. I'm an endangered species. Ooof! Batty, calm down. What is it? Mayday. We're going down. This is Chopper One. We're going down. Help. I'm sorry, Batty. I don't understand. Two words - hu... man! Humans? Hu, hu, hu, hu... - Where are the humans, Batty? - Where are the humans? I'll tell you. They're right behind me. Run for it! There are no humans in FernGully. It's perfectly safe. FernGully safe? Survey says, uh-uh, wrong answer. Lounge around all you want in your fungal furniture. I'm outta here. I'm a ghost. I'm history. You can't see me. Bye-bye now. No way, Jos. You won't find old Batty hanging around. What's that? What's happening? Crysta, look out! A human! Yeesh! And an ugly one at that. Go, Slasher. Go, Boof. Yikes! Gotcha! Pathetic animal. Let's see what we have got today. Don't ruin his fur, you stupid mutt. Oh, another wombat. Ooh, a little bandicoot. Cute. Oh, just a joey kangaroo. You'll make a nice pair of slippers. Why'd they have to make these things so complicated? Beats me, Boss. Well, what did we get? Three more, Boss. Splendid. There's three animals we'll never see again. No, this can't be happening! Maybe it's a terrible dream. Maybe I'll pinch myself and wake up. Ouch! I'm awake! So those animals are really gone. And humans will buy them or sell them or eat them or wear them! Oh, and experiment with them. But they're only babies. Their parents... Oh, what will I tell them? Agh, a bug! Just a bit of dirt! What was that? Relax, Boss. Just think of all the money we'll make when we sell those baby animals. Huh? I'm trying to relax. I tell ya, Mac, I don't know how you put up with this outdoorsy life. You're doing all right, Boss. Roughing it will put hair on your chest. Maybe so... - I still prefer bubble baths and room service. - Hmm... I'm with you there. Careful, Boss. Don't wanna burn down a thousand years of rain forest. What do I care? Wait a minute. Rain forest? How can you set fire to a rain forest? Trust me, Boss, it'll go up. And if it does, it'll be the end of your little hunting trip. It wont just be the end of my little hunting trip. Blasted bugs. I'll get you! Nice shot. Boof, boof! What are you looking at? Get over there and guard the animals. And don't let me catch you sleeping on the job. That gives me a real creepy feeling, right down my spine. Aaargh! Shh. Yikes! Nugget! Quiet. I need your help. Nugget! Nugget! Hi, Mom. How ya doin'? Shh. - You can do it, Bandy. - Come on, Bandy. It's easy. Mrs. K, look out! You're not so tough. Or fast. Huh? What the...? My hat! Boys, we've found ourselves some action. Ayee! - Nice shot. - Yeah, yeah! Get him! Bugs! We're surrounded by bugs! I'll get you... - That guy could lose some weight. - You should talk. Yowwww! Word up! Can't you do better than that? Dog food... I like that. What's next? Come on. Let's get back and help the others. Over here. Hurry. Let's go. I hate bugs! - Look out! - I'll squash you like a... Like a bug! Follow me! Get in the truck - now! Let's go! Step on it! Let's get out of here. Leave the dogs. My baby... Nugget! My Nugget! Stupid dog. My baby! Oh, Father, there's so much healing needed. I don't know where to start. There are many of us to help. It will take all of our love and care. But some things, my dear, even with all our magic, do not mend quickly. Crysta! - How's Mrs. K? - She needs more water. I'll get it. I'm so sorry, Mother. They were in my care and were my responsibility. No, Crysta. There is no way to prepare for humans. I only hope he knows I love him. - I'll bring him back so he can tell you himself. - Pips! Me and the Beetle Boys will go after those humans and rescue the babies. - Well, someone has to do it. - Pips, none of us has been outside the forest. And they're probably in the town by now. What's "the town"? The town is no place for little bugs like you. It's full of weedkiller, television, tax attorneys. It's a horrible place. You mean we should give up, without trying to find the babies? In a word, yes. Well, I'm not afraid of any old weedkiller. And if a television tries any funny business with me, whammo! Yeah! I'm surrounded by idiots! Except this one, I like her. The girl can stay. - To the town! - Yeah! Uh... which way do we go, Pips? Hmm... Batty? - I'm not telling. - Batty... No, no, no. You know better than any of us the terrible things humans do to animals. That's what'll happen to those babies unless we rescue them. So true. I'm coming with you. You wouldn't last two minutes without me leading the way. - I thought you were scared of humans. - Scared? Huh! Moi? Course I am. You gotta be batty not to be afraid of humans. I mean, have you ever seen one eat an oyster? It's terrible. We'll miss you, Crysta. I want you to take this with you. Oops! Fairy dust! Look after it. And remember what I told you. You bet I will. Good luck, Crysta. Good luck to you, Pips. Don't worry, Crysta. We won't let FernGully down. Wow! - Is that the town, Pips? - I don't think so. Batty says the town is really ugly. But that's beautiful. - Hey! - Pretty lights. Looks like all the fireflies are out tonight. Yeah. Maybe they heard we was coming to town. Come on. Let's introduce ourselves. Yeah. Uh... you first, Stump. No, no, you first. - It was your idea. - Was not. That buzzing noise means something bad, but I can't recall... - Biggest first. - No, smallest first. Hi there, little glow-worm. What's your name, cutie? I remember! Don't touch it! It's... Electricity! - Dangerous. - Batty, will you cut it out? Take a look at this, fellas. I never knew there were so many humans in all the world. - Those humans don't look so tough. - Let's take a closer look. Ooh, bad idea. I see disaster, ruin, peptic ulcers. Years of therapy! Don't worry, Batty. This looks like fun. I love this ride! Look out, Stump! Hey! Shoo, fly! Yum! I don't know why I bother. You're all totally out of control. - I can't get enough of this human world. - Yeah, yeah. Sure is fun. - Oh, yes! Having fun, are we? - That's right, pal. Well, I've got a joke for you. - Yeah! - What? What? It's about some fairies who volunteered to go to the scary, human world - to rescue some poor, defenseless little... - Babies! Oh, you've heard this one! We don't know where to look, Batty. They don't know where to look! Big surprise! I ain't afraid of no weedkiller. I'll find your little babies. But this place is so big. And there are so many humans. And they all look the same. Those babies could be anywhere. Better get some sleep. Human fun takes it outta you, let me tell you. You're not going anywhere tonight, little fella. Heel, Slasher, heel! You gotta smarten up, dog. No use pining for your pal. You got work to do. All those animals are tucked in and sound asleep, Boss. I don't know how anyone could sleep here. There are creepy-crawlies everywhere. You just have to get used to 'em, Boss. Yeah. Those overseas buyers will pay a fortune for those little critters. I'm gonna get me a penthouse apartment in the mountains with a pool hanging off the back. It'll have air conditioning, pool table, electronic everything. Things are definitely looking... up! That's all right, Boss. You'll get the hang of it. Good night. - Huh? - Oh? - What's going on? - I don't know. I don't believe... It's that blasted little kangaroo again. Where? There. You call yourself a guard dog? I don't know why I bother with you, I really don't. Sleep tight, Boss. Mind the bugs don't bite. Wonderful work, Crysta. Thanks, Father. I can't believe the carelessness of those humans. Humans have forgotten they used to live here with us. Remember, Father, not all humans have forgotten. Wait there, little flowers. I'll get you some water. What was that? Hmm, what the...? Oh my! It's the humans' monster. Are you hurt? Oh, you poor creature. It's all right. I just wanna help you. It's no good. I'm not strong enough. What an awful machine! Serves him right. But he's helpless. He'll die if we just leave him here. Please help him. You're lucky I can't refuse a fairy request. - Boof, boof! - I beg your pardon? - Boof, boof. - That's your name? Boof? Pleased to meet you, Boof. Oh, you want me to see your paw? It'll be fine. There. Does that feel better? Ooh! Grrr! It's all right. Boof's just being friendly. He don't belong in FernGully. He's just a pet. A toy for humans. This is a living creature who is lost and scared, and he needs help getting home. Something tells me you're not gonna just fix his leg and send him on his way. No. I've got to take him home somehow. Ruff, ruff! That's right. But where is your home? Of course. Down the river, in the town. Come on, Goanna. We're gonna need your help getting started. It'll be all right, Boof. We'll get you home. Just hang on tight. Come on. OK, Goanna, if you would be so kind. This time we're gonna get it right, Budgie. Keep your eyes up at all times. Keep counting the beats in your head. - One, two, three, four... Feel the rhythm. - Wait a minute! Oh no! No, no, no, Pips. No, bad idea. Batty, we don't know which way to go. We need help. I'm gonna ask someone. Why can't we look separately? Not entirely separately. We should stick together, especially round me! Huh! Those don't look like regular humans. - She looks like one of us. - Kinda big, though. I'm gonna fall, Grandpa. I know I'm gonna fall. Concentrate, Budgie, concentrate! Oh, Budgie, you've got no sense of balance. I don't think you'll ever be ready for the clown act. - Did that human hurt you? - Who... who...? That funny-looking guy with the big nose. Did he hurt you? Hurt me? No! That's my grandpa. - What are you? - A fairy, of course. I guess you've never seen one. That's OK. I won't hold it against you. I've never seen a human like you before, so I guess were kind of even. - This is my first time out of FernGully. - FernGully? Where I'm from. The place I live. - It's in the forest. - Don't tell her that! Aagh! Horrible bugs! - No, it's all right. They're my friends. - Get 'em away from me. Oh, my gosh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm OK, I think. You humans sure pack some punch. - I really hurt you. - No, I'm fine. Really. You need to rest. Can you say personal injury attorney? You and your friends should come inside. I have to practice but you'll be safe in here. - My name's Pips. - I'm Budgie. Pleased to meet you. Mayday! Batty to FernGully. Do you read me? Pips captured by human. Mission a disaster. Come in, FernGully. Do you copy? Come on back, big buddy. My handle is Roadkill. Looking for signs of little baby animal life. Looking, looking... Ooof! Just a minute, what's this? Oddly familiar. It's a clue! Joy and hallelujah, I found a clue! Bleurgh! It's clear to me now. I've got to find the others. Ooof! Hey, it's Batty. Let him in, guys. Yeah! Fellas, fellas! Hey, I found the... Batty, check this out. River on, river off. River on, river off. Can you beat that? Sun on, sun off. Sun on, sun off. Ha ha ha! Whoo-hoo! Waaah! Aaah... You gotta try this icy creamy stuff. What's this? Yee! I insist that you steer clear of that sinister square. Don't be such a spoilsport, Batty. This is our friend's world. Exactamundo! We don't belong here. We... Whoa! D'oh! I found the babies! The forest, the humans, the fire, the truck. The babies! Budgie's gonna take us on some rides later. Oh, no. You're turning into humans. I'm going to rescue the babies. Is anybody coming with me? Just you, huh? Uh-huh, uh-huh. OK, partner, it's just you and me. Now we're getting somewhere. Bark, you go in and I'll guard the exit. We'll both guard the exit. No, I'll go round the back. Hoss, Little Joe, the barn's on fire! Charge! There he is! Grab him! Ouch! That hurts! Is that a probe? Bad move with the charging. Never mind, Batty. It was nice of you to try. Yeah, you can always rely on Batty. Thanks, Bandy. Yeee! This is the dumbest ride I ever saw. - Maybe we're not doing it right, Stump. - Sure isn't too exciting. That's more like it. Way to go! Look out, boys. Where'd you learn to shoot like that, Mac? Lots of practice. Batty was captured, but I found the babies. Oh... - Bark, Bark, Bark! - Way to go, Bark! Let's go find Pips. Be careful, Pips. It's so high. Wah-hoh! How do you do that? It's not that hard. I've been practicing my clown tricks for years, concentrating my brains out. But the harder I try, the worse I get. Maybe you're trying too hard. Thinking about something and doing it are two different things. Just do it. Show-off. Pips! Of course, wings are a big help. Not so easy now, is it, little fella? But it won't be long before you're out of here. One little truck ride, then onto a boat and sailing out of the country. Cheerio. I want my mommy! Come on, guys. It could be worse. At least we've got each other. Agh! What's gonna happen to us, Batty? Oh, zoo exhibits, laboratory testing, handbags. You don't wanna know the details. You always wanted to cruise away to exotic places. No. Me neither, but that's what we're going to do. Bye! Step right up. We need one more to play. Let's play. Go! We have a winner. Here you are, little lady. Nugget! Careful, Pips. Someone might see you. - What is it? What's wrong? - There's something about this place. I can't concentrate. I came here because humans came to FernGully and captured baby animals. That's horrible. I'm supposed to find them, but this place is so distracting. I'm sorry, Pips. I'll help you. We'll find them together. - Pips, we found 'em! - We know where the babies are. Come on! Let's go get 'em! OK, boys, lead the way. Wait for me! Is that them? That's them. - Certainly is. - No doubt. Come on, Boss. That's the last of 'em. We're all loaded up and ready to go. Finally! - The animals must be in there. - What do we do, Pips? I'm thinking. I'm thinking. Geronimo! Budgie! Wow! Hey, slow down! There are kids around here! That's Budgie! Hey! - We'll never catch them. - It's hopeless. We gotta catch 'em. Come on! - It'll be great to get back into civilization. - I have to agree with you, Boss. I can feel that Jacuzzi bath already. I'll be up to me neck in lovely, warm water. We'll be in hot water if we miss our connection. Can't you go any faster? Put your foot on it. Whoa! Oh! Hang on, Budgie! You can do it! Hey, she did it! Oh! Boof, boof! Whoa! Mmm... Pah! My birds! There's a girl on the truck. She's stealing the birds! - Get rid of her. - What, me? Yes. I'm the brains and you're the dumb one who does the dangerous stuff. You're right. Fat lot of good you'll be anyway. Take the wheel. I can't drive no truck! - Agh! It's you! - I'm here to save you! - You kidnapped Pips. - Pips is coming. The boys are on their way. That's a relief. Don't take kindly to people who steal from me. You're in big trouble. Good luck, girlie. Whoa! - Budgie! - Whoa! D'oh! Budgie! Whoooooah! Help! Hang on, Budgie! That human's in trouble. But humans are trouble. What to do! It's not my business. I didn't ask her to... save my life. I'm coming! Aaaah! Budgie! Oh... oh! Whoa! Whoa! Oh, Budgie. I thought I'd lost you. You were so brave! Budgie, you're OK! Yay! Great work, Batty. I'm proud of you! Look at you, palling around with humans. Huh? I thought I was dreaming, but you're real. - You're actually fair... - Failures. What? Don't say that. I blew it. I spent so much time thinking of myself that we've lost the babies. Don't be so sure about giving up. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. This thing comes with all the options. I was promised a shipment of birds and I don't see no birds. We got the baby animals. What about the birds? They were, uh... stolen. Hah! Now that's rich. The poachers got poached. And now you want $50,000 for a few crates of mangy animals? - I'm not that mangy. - Me neither. Get those crates loaded quick smart. Of course, of course. Mac, get to it. Stupid mutt! - Hey! - Look out! Oh... We're finally getting our act together. That's it. Brilliant. Shhh! What's taking so long? Where are those animals? Blimey! Stop them! Stop them! If anyone tries to get on, tear 'em to pieces. Faster, Grandpa. Go faster. Whoa! Oh! Oh, no! Aaargh! Hey! This is no time to practice our act, Budgie. I'm not letting those monsters get away with the animals. I'll take care of the situation. I've got a plan. I'll reason with them like adults. I've got everything under control. Oh, no! That girl's in trouble. Let's go, Boof! - Crysta! - Did you find the babies? They're up there. Heel, Slasher! Charge! Get in there! Whoa! Get us outta here! Oh, no! It's up to me. I've got what it takes to do the job. I'll take him by surprise. He'll never know what hit him. Windows... Gotta remember those windows. I've been doing this too long. No! We can't let them get away! Give me the gift of fairy hopes. Turn them all into fairy ropes. Get him, boys! Please... grow! You can do it, Bark. Yeah, little Beetle Boy, give it all you've got! You little pest. - I did it! - Bark, look out! Get outta there! My money! Almost got it. One more... Nugget, no! Oh! Whoa! It's too dark down there. We couldn't find him. I'm so sorry. Nugget. Oh, Nugget... What's goin' on over there? - Nugget? - I knew I could do it. Did I miss anything? Oy! I told you we shoulda hired a plane. Shut up. Well, at least things couldn't get any worse. Actually... it's low tide. - It's time to go home. - Home. That sounds great. - Boof! - Boof, you and your friend can't go with us. You belong in the human world. I know someone who's always wanted a puppy. How about two big ones? - We couldn't have done it without you. - It was an honor, Pips. - Maybe we could visit again? - Oh, you have to. Any time. You too, Batty. I'm happy here, thank you. There are no surprises in Fern... ...Gully. Pips... Goodbye, Pips. Goodbye, Budgie. Hey, Father, that looks great. Crysta, Pips, you're back! But what about the baby animals? Did you find them? Mom! Ah... ah... - My baby! - Mrs. K! You're almost better. Hey, Mom. What's for dinner? - Nugget! - I love you, Mom. - Pips? - Uh-huh. You don't think you'll find FernGully a bit, you know... quiet, now that you've met humans and been to the town? Oh, I don't think so. You can make your own fun. All it takes is a little imagination.
