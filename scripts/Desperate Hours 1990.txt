( Rattling ) Put your left hand on top of your head. Now the other one. Guard: We're at the gate. In the three years since my client's incarceration... For the record, a 12-year sentence for manslaughter during a bank robbery. In the three years since Michael Bosworth's incarceration, he's completed the Johns Hopkins Creative Writing Workshop. In addition, I present the court two letters of character reference from nationally known authors. And I'll produce transcripts from the mothers of two men he shot down in the past. Nancy: I'll also point out that Michael Bosworth's I. Q has been measured above 130. Prosecutor: The prosecution concedes that Michael Bosworth is very intelligent but we also know that he always reverts to violence. The charge before the court is attempted murder. It defies all reason that Michael Bosworth would jeopardize a flawless prison record by attacking a guard over... ( bangs ) I'm not a case history. ( Gavel thumps ) The defendant will speak only when spoken to. - I don't need... - ( Bangs ) Bailiff, sit this man down! I don't need a rich girl's self-serving charity! I'm just pro bono busy work for her rich daddy's law firm! Judge: Bailiff, sit the man down! I want to go pro per! I demand to represent myself! My life is in jeopardy from every guard in that prison. - And Nancy Breyers' defense... - ( Gavel bangs ) is trivial, unsuitable, weak, and defeatist! Mr. Bosworth, if necessary, I will have you gagged and bound. Ms. Breyers has represented you diligently these past weeks. You are fighting for your life. You may not go pro per. Your Honor, may I be permitted to confer with my client in private? I've got nothing to say to you. Permission granted. I have nothing to say to you. Man walking! - I'm gonna grab a sandwich. - You got it. Stand right here. Ma'am. Hold it right there, lady. You stay here. Mr. Bosworth, I am trying desperately to think what more I can do to convince you of my competence in your defense. Please, I've worked very hard to help you. Please, I've... worked very hard. ( Sniffles ) Relax, cowboy. Hook him up. Hook him up. You better do what he says. Please put your hands behind your back. ( Chair rattles ) Son of a... God damn it! ( Cracks ) - ( gasps ) - Let's go! Whatever I do, it's only because I need you. - Say you need me. - I need you. - I want you to act scared of me. - I am scared of you. ( Guard grunts ) - I knew something would go wrong! - Driver: You got no faith, Albert. Nancy! Hi! I thought you were supposed to be in court this morning. - Nancy: Gotta keep going. - Oof! Hey... I'll wait for you... open your eyes and look at me! I'll wait for you. I'll wait for you as long as it takes. Woman: Nancy! Nancy! My brother knows what he's doing. Open the door! Open the door! - Where's the lawyer? - Get outta here. Move! Nancy, are you okay? ( Dog barks ) - Daddy! - Hey, Zack! Hiya, kid. How you doing? Okay? - Okay. - Ls your mom in? Yeah, come see Mommy. Come on. Hey, Mom! Look! Hey, Mom! Look! it's Daddy! Zack, what are you doing in shorts? It's almost winter. - Go up and get changed. - Hi. You're not supposed to be here till this afternoon. Hello. Hey. Daughter: I'm surprised you guys are talking to each other. Yeah. I love your hair like that. It's beautiful when you wear it that way. - Oh, come on. - I'm late. All right. Mom, Kyle will be driving me to riding class after school, okay? - Okay. - ( Playing classical music ) if it makes you feel any better, she's a lot harder on me when we're alone. Hey, come here, I want to talk... ( music resumes ) She's still going out with Kyle? Nora? ( Sighs ) I never liked that kid. Kids his age are supposed to be cocky, full of life. You know what I mean? Trouble is with Kyle, he thinks too much. Nora: We can't all be full of surprises like you. Kyle's reliable. If she marries someone like him she won't have to worry about him running off with some female half his age. - Of course, I'm only quoting. - That is not fair, Nora. Okay, so Karen is 24 years old. So what? "Fair"? Ls that what you still think life has to be, Tim... fair? Jesus Christ. When are you gonna grow up? Well, I am trying. Look, I came to tell you that Karen is over. - I've broken up with her. - Poor baby. Abandoned at her tender age. The truth is, Nora, I came this morning hoping to talk with you. What are we doing? Wrestling? You always make sure you're not here when I pick up Zack. Nora: We have nothing more to say to each other. If you want to talk to me, talk, and then leave me alone. They're at it again. Go put on your pants, okay? Do you need any money, anything you and the kids need? - Nora: Please, Tim, not that! - Well, what do you want? What I have always wanted... somebody that I can trust! Somebody that I can depend on! Not you! I do want to tell you one thing. I figured it out. I took up with Karen because she wasn't you. Well, even dumb me figured that one out. Now I've broken it off with her because she wasn't like you. I can't believe anything you say, Tim. No, I don't blame you. Are you sure you want to sell the house? The kids are settled here and all the work you've put in and everything. Okay, I'm sorry. ( Sighs ) Too many bad memories, huh? And good ones. Ditto. One thing you've gotta believe, Nora... I never wanted to hurt you. Well, you struck out there. Hey, Zack! Come on, let's go! Nora: Zack? Tim: Hey, there's a brontosaurus in the pool! Zack: No way, they've been extinct for more than a million years. Hey... how about a kiss? Now, listen, don't forget to tell your English teacher the difference between "lie" and "lay." Mom, she'll flunk me for being a smart-ass. I doubt it. Don't I get a kiss? Just a friendly kiss? - Nora: Bye. - See you later. I'll call back this afternoon. Will you be here? I don't think so. I'll leave a key under the mat. You take care now. Nora: You, too. You sure? Tim: Sorry. Tim: See you later. - Hey, young fella. - Hi. - You wanna drive? - Yeah, that'd be great! - Okay, move over. - Zack: All right. ( Car door closes ) - Go on. - Come on, Dad. Come on. - All right, let's go. - ( Engine starts, roars ) Mom, bye! Bye, Mommy! ( Engine roaring ) Driver: Now what? What, are you gonna take a swim? Albert: I don't get it. Won't the cops be looking for the car? So they will, Albert, so they will. But not this one. - Feast your eyes, boys. - It's a Jaguar. We're gonna steal a Jaguar? Holy shit. Where'd you get the keys? You know who God helps, don't you, brother? Albert: I never even rode in a Jaguar before. Hey, I told you. That's my brother. - Mike, can I drive? - Sure, you can drive. Whoo! Yeah! You can drive that beat-up old Cougar right into the lake. ( Engine starts ) Take this. - Albert, can you whistle? - Sure. I want you to whistle so I can hear you. And I don't want you to stop unless you see somebody coming down the road or a car pull up. ( Whistles tune ) Hey, Albert! Move that goddamn log out of the way! - ( Whistling ) - ( Engine roaring ) ( whistling ) Geronimo! Whoo! Mikey! Mikey! Mikey! Man: She's good. She's real good. Gotta hand it to her, she's holding up real well. I hate playing good cop/bad cop. It's bullshit. I was too hard on her. The lady is a liar, among other things. - How do you get that? - I've got a feeling. - A feeling? - Call it "women's intuition." Here's what you want. Bob? Bob? - Yeah? - Agent: What? This is Carl Ornitz from the U.S. Attorney's office. He has some news for us. Not news for the good of mankind, I assume. When Michael Bosworth was originally prosecuted, there was a significant part of the government's case that was excluded from the trial because of an inadmissible confession. So when Bosworth was being pursued, he broke into a liquor store. He wanted to take the clerk with him. The owner resisted. He was found shot. A couple of weeks later, Bosworth was arrested. He confessed to the crime before he was read his rights. We think he confessed on purpose. He was never tried for murder, only for armed robbery. The thing is, he had a prior conviction for burglary. People were at home. He held them hostage... - And? - And as usual, somebody got dead. - Are you going to file on her? - Better. I'm letting her go. What are you talking about? I haven't even done my affidavit yet. Let's quit screwing around and get a Title 3 for her phone. Evidence won't help us with this lady. Even if we had cold proof... even if that marshal recovers, she'd waltz into court and say she was "mesmerized." "He made me do it." Temporary insanity. Look at her. She's too smart. I want her to be free as a kite. I want her to go to him because she wants him. Then we'll take the lovebirds together. Michael: Rich man, poor man... beggar man, thief. Brother: I like the one back there with the swimming pool, man. That's pretty nice. Albert: I think we should get the hell out of here. ( Birds chirping ) ( sighs ) Son of a bitch. Yeah, yeah, my heating is gone. My house was freezing last night. - Man: What's the address again? - 1448 Whitney Drive. - Whitney Drive? - When can you get someone out here? Man: Look, we're really backed up now. We'll get someone out there as soon as we can. Ls that "soon" as in "real soon," or "soon" as in - "whenever the hell we feel like it"? - ( Knock on door ) Do you want me to put it on the radio or not? - Yeah. - ( Knock on door ) Okay, okay, just get somebody out here, please, thank you. - ( Knocking continues ) - Coming. ( Knocking ) Good morning. You called about a winter cover for your pool? What? No, I'm sorry. This house is sold... unless my husband may have called. - Oh, yes, it was your husband. - No, he would have told me about this. ( Creaking ) ( gasps ) Look, if you scream, your children are gonna come home, and they're gonna find you in a pool of blood. Please. What do you want? Hey, there's a swimming pool in the back, and it's heated. Um, someone left their bikini on the grass. - That's my daughter's. - Oh, yeah? How old? Is she cute? The keys to the station wagon. - The keys? - Michael: I can help you. You're scared now. The fear will pass. You'll feel proud of yourself. And I'll feel proud of you. The keys. ( Gasps ) ( keys jingle ) No one's gonna hurt you. I promise. Okay? You gotta learn to trust me. You probably can't absorb any of this right now, but you and I are gonna be friends. Michael: Would you like to go upstairs and put something else on? Nora: Yes. Michael: Albert! What are you doing up there? Michael: Albert, were you in Nora's bedroom? You are never to enter that bedroom without Nora's permission. I parked the Jag in the garage. Let's just take the goddamn car and go. I don't like it here. Michael: Well, then you leave. You're only here because when I was in prison, my brother needed your help. I want you to go through the house. I want you to look for money and jewelry. Nora, sit down. Sit down. I want to reassure you. - You have a daughter, May? - How did you know her name? Well, I was going through your husband's letters, and, uh... She's 15? And then there's the younger child? Zack. He's... ahem... - He's eight? - Yeah. They come home from school around what time? Nora, don't make me resent the kids before I even meet them. Zack gets dropped off around 3:00. - By a carpool? - Yes. Does the parent come to the door? Of course not, picking the children up is hectic enough without dropping... Gimme a break, lady. Nora, do you think you could speak on the telephone without crying? If you can, we can be out of here a hell of a lot faster. Yes, anything. You're a strong woman, Nora. You know, smart men love strong women. Brother: What if they tap Nancy's phone? Michael: She's a victim. They'd never suspect her. I'm a very fair man, Nora. You know, I would never hurt anyone unless they were trying to hurt me. I swear it. Here's what I want you to say. "Hi, Nancy. it's Nora. "Just called to gossip. Nothing important." And I want you to leave her this number. All right? Now you try it. Hi, Nancy. it's Nora. Just nothing important. Just called... No, no, no, no, no, no. I want you to smile. Okay, there. That's it. Big smile. - You've got a beautiful smile. - ( Dial tone hums ) You try. ( Faintly ) Smile. ( Keypad beeps ) ( line ringing ) Recording: Hi, this is Nancy. Please leave your message after the beep. - ( Beeps ) - Hi, Nancy. it's Nora. Nothing important. Just called to say hi. Ca... call me back at 555-4810. Bye. - Good girl. - ( Beeps, dial tone hums ) Nora? Nora? Come on, open up, Nora! Open the door! Come on, I want to apologize! I'll camp outside. ( Yelling ) I once waited in line two days for tickets for the World Series, so I mean business! Open up! I'm gonna break in like the big, bad wolf! Nora! I'm not going to ask again! Open up! Hey! Anyone home? Nora? Hey. I want to apologize for this morning. ( Door closes ) Tim! ( All yelling ) No, no! Leave him alone! Enough, man! - Albert! Albert! - He was gonna use it on me! You saw it. He was gonna use it on me! Enough! Albert, you're frightening Nora. You stupid shit! Everything's under control. Timmy's got the idea. He's gonna do exactly as we say. Everything's gonna be all right. What the fuck is going on here?! Who are these guys? He's gonna be just fine, Nora, as soon as he figures out the rules. Here's $500. MasterCard. Visa. Take it. Take it all. Michael: Are you considering the options now? Force? Negotiation? Maybe a little psychology? - What do you want? - I'm waiting for my fiancee. I just want a place to relax. What if the police followed you? I won't lie to you, Timmy. If they touch me, they touch you. Why here? Why my house? Fate. Besides, this isn't your house any longer. - I saw a "for sale" sign out front. - There's a kid out there! Michael: A "for sale" sign is a trouble sign. Take me. We can leave now. Take me as a hostage. - ( Hammer clicks ) - You think before you act. Mom, I'm hungry! ( Game audio squeaks ) Huh. Hit him! - Albert: You want to beat Tyson? - Yeah. Yeah, duck and hit from the same side he did. I'm not even past Bald Bull. When you get your star button, use it as soon as you get it. Hey, Zack. What's going on? Mom? Mommy? Mommy! - Tim: Don't touch my kid! - Mommy! Mommy! - Zack. - Michael: Let's all relax. I got some questions that I want some answers to. Do you have a gun in the house, Timmy? No, they're not safe with kids around. You're not around here to protect Nora any longer. Did you get a gun when Timmy left? No guns. So, Timmy, tell me, is there any chance that anyone from your office would be stopping by here? - No. - What does a man like you do to... to have all this? I was a corporate lawyer, but I quit so I could defend psychopaths like you. Wally, I want you to take the brat into the other room now. - Mommy, don't let him take me. - It's okay. We'll play some TV. I won't hurt him. it's okay. It's all right. it's all right. Zack, go with him. - Michael: Move it, Wally. - Mommy! Nora, are you okay? You were once a successful lawyer, and you gave it all up to work for something more meaningful? Gee, Timmy, why'd you do that? You want to know the truth? I watched too many westerns. I wanted to be the sheriff. Nora, what do you have prepared for dinner? I have a turkey. Anything else you want? I'd like to wash. Nora, you don't suppose Timmy has any fresh shirts in the closet? I like to dress for dinner. How did he talk you into this, Wally? Nobody talked me into nothing, all right? Really? Seems to me you're in deep shit, kid. ( Door closes ) A man is not a gentleman unless he knows how to mix a proper martini... and tie a proper bow tie. ( Recording beeps ) Hi, Nancy. it's Nora. Nothing important. Just called to say hi. Call me back at 555-4810. Nancy: 555-4810. ( Line clicks, beeps ) Wally: Where's the heat in this place? It's getting chilly in here. Nora: it doesn't work. ( Utensil clatters ) Michael: Got to be careful with these things, "Sheriff." - You could get yourself... - ( Thumps ) Mmm. Hm. Shouldn't your girlfriend have called by now? ( Fanfare plays ) And yours? Albert: Mike! Michael, it's the news! Let's go. Come on. ( Program music plays ) News anchor: Good evening. Attorney Nancy Breyers says it's a miracle escaped killer Michael Bosworth did not kill her. Police officials report she's cooperating fully... Maybe we should get the hell outta here, Mike. She's cooperating. I told you. I told you she would do that. You heard that, right? News anchor: Now the latest we... You know, you're as thick as two bricks. Don't you understand that the more she cooperates the more they're gonna think she's a victim? Would you do me a favor, Wally? Don't think. Don't talk to me like Albert, Mike! I'm your brother. All right, come here! Don't you... - ( piano bangs ) - Don't you understand, huh?! Listen to me! Look at me! I love her. She's the only person that I'd die for. - Now you get it together. - ( Tires screech ) ( rock music playing ) ( music continues, engine rumbles ) May: Look at you. You're blushing. - He gonna come in? - Nora: He never does. - She's some piece of work. - Don't hurt her. Please! Don't let... Hey, I don't... l didn't mean any disrespect. Wally: I would never hurt your daughter. I would never hurt any girl. ( Both shouting ) if that kid comes in here... I'm gonna start with you. - Hi, Kyle! Hi, honey. - May: Daddy, hi! - Hi. - You mad at me? Mad at you? No. I love you. You know that. I love you. Hey, you know what? Look, why don't I buy you guys dinner? You know, just go and have some fun. Mom wants you and Zack to spend the weekend with me - so I'll see you at my place later. - Kyle: I can't. - Here, take it. - I work tonight, sir. Well, take the night off. I'll pay you double time. Tim: How much do you make? Go on, take it. Hey, May! Come here! ( Music continues ) May! Come back! May! There's nothing we can do, May. Give me back my Walkman. ( Player clicks ) ( all shouting ) Easy, Albert! Easy! Easy, Albert! Easy! Put it on a leash. May: What the fuck is going on here?! May... I'm getting really angry. You want to point the gun at someone, point it at me. You want to threaten someone, threaten me. Sheriff, you just don't get it. May, listen to me. You do as they say. They're very dangerous. They're fucking idiots. - Stop it! - No, Daddy! No! - Albert! - Stop it! Albert, put him down. - Nora: No, stop! - Zack: Daddy! Nora: Stop it, Albert! Stop it! It's not over. I promised Nora no one's gonna get hurt. Nora, please sit down. - Zack? - Yes, Daddy? It's way past your bedtime. - Okay, Daddy. - Zack. - What? - What do you want to do? L-I don't know. Play Nintendo, maybe. No, Zack. You're going to bed. Come on, we have rules. You're not giving the orders in the house anymore, Timmy. There's too many rules. Zack, go play. Live a little. Good night, Mommy. I love you. Love you. ( Sobs ) Daddy, please. Oh, Daddy, - don't let them hurt us! - I know. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, be strong, kid. I'm proud of you. Come on, you're going to be fine. No, Daddy, please. I don't want to go. I'm scared, Daddy. I know. You're going to be fine. Come on. - Come on. - Okay, okay, okay. - Be strong for me. Okay? - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'll go. ( sobbing ) Hey, Zack, where are you going? ( Snaps ) I'm going to bed! You live by too many rules. I certainly feel sorry for Nora. Take your hands off her. - Is that another rule, Tim? - You bet. Albert: There's a guy out there! I think he's... he's a plumber or something! From the heat... heating company. Somebody was supposed to come this morning. ( Doorbell buzzes ) Michael: You get rid of him. ( Grunts ) I called you this morning. Lady, you're my 15th service call today. You have to pay whether I come inside or not. Well, it's too late. My kids are already asleep. You still have to pay. $48.06. I have to get a check. Michael: 48 bucks for not doing a damn thing. That's why America's becoming a second-rate country. I wouldn't pay him. What difference does it make? I thought you wanted him to go! Michael: it's the principle. You could've been a thousand miles away, Albert. Now you're trapped here waiting for the police to come. Yeah? You're trying to fuck me up. I'm not listening. ( Doorbell buzzing ) ( May groans ) Write another check. You get rid of him. - You want a receipt? - Canceled check will be fine. You okay? ( Whimpers ) - Liar. - Tim: Nora! Hold it! I know how to use it! Let her go! May! Go upstairs! Now! Let her go, Wally! Let her go, Wally! - Go! - Albert? Huh? Albert for Nora? I read your letters to Nora, Tim. You both want to rekindle your passion for life. Hey, I know that feeling. I know that feeling. And you're both liars. Mendacity is the great sin that's destroying America. And I'm a living reproach to you 'cause I'm an honest man. You want to destroy me, but you're no match for me. It's judgment call, Tim. Huh? it's your move. You want to play this game, Timmy? But you gotta be willing to go all the way. Come on. Come on. Come on! ( Knife clatters ) Nora: Don't hurt him! You know, I really like this family, but you're pushing my patience. - He was gonna cut my throat. - So what? Wally: Albert! Albert! ( Yells ) - What do we do now...? - You idiot! You see what happens when you lie, Nora? You're lucky you're still alive. Get Timmy upstairs now. Come on. He needs stitches. May, help me with this. May! - Are you okay, Daddy? - May! - Zack: You'll get through this. - Put your finger up there. Tim, you can't go on taking chances like that. - You can't. - There's nothing else to do, Nora. - Come on. Okay. - Move your hand, Zack. Zack, I'm gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be fine. - They'll leave soon. - Rip me off some tape. Hey, Daddy, why don't you shoot them with Mommy's gun? What? You got a gun? When'd you get a gun? - I bought it when you left. - Why? I was scared at night. I was afraid at night! - You've got a gun? - Pull me off some tape. - May: Where is the gun, Mom? - It's up on top of that cabinet. More tape. Tape! Hurry, Zack! - I'm trying, Mommy. - Tim: Quietly. All right, okay. - Here. - Nora: More. Mom, the gun is not here. Nora: May, it is up there somewhere! Well, one of the retards must have found it! I'm sure Bosworth doesn't know anyway. Hey, May, remember when you jumped from here to the garage roof? She broke her arm! I was a little girl then. I can make it now, Daddy. It's a closer angle from Zack's room. Zack, can you try just jumping off? Daddy... Daddy, I'm too scared, Daddy! Nora: And you know heights make him dizzy. I won't let them take the chance. What if they fall or get caught? Then they're in the same situation they're in now. Isn't it worth a chance? Thanks. - Zack, don't try till it's light. - No! - Oh, come on... - No! What if Bosworth is telling the truth? What if he really doesn't mean to hurt us? ( Door rattling ) Michael wants the children to sleep in their own room tonight. May: Zack, Come on. I'll tell you a story. ( Nora whimpers ) No... Zack, I'll tell you a story. Zack...? I'll see you in the morning. If they make it out tonight, we won't be Bosworth's favorite family anymore. I hold you responsible... ( gasps ) for everything that's happened, Tim. He kept his word. Nobody got hurt until you broke your word! Nora? Everything that happened up till now doesn't matter. It doesn't exist. Yesterday, we were bickering about who got to keep the goddamn golf membership. You can't believe him, Nora. You have to trust me. You have to trust me. I just... I just want to go to sleep. I just want to go to sleep... ( sniffles ) and never wake up. Here. I love you. ( Sighs ) ( tires squealing ) ( Bob on radio ) 12-28 across the state line. Agent: Of course she is. Bob: I hate it when you talk like you already know what's happening. "Hate" is a strong word, Bob. Just stay with her. Man: Primary's stopping at a phone booth. ( Coins jingling ) Can't make out the number. Recording: We're sorry, Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and dial again or call your operator to help you. ( Engine roaring ) Agent: Tell "Tail-end Charlie" to pick up the number on that pay phone. Call the phone company and find out who she called at 7:15 a.m. We're losing her. Agent: Let the state police book her, but make sure they keep it quiet. I want Bosworth to be expecting her. While Romeo waits, we'll have a chat with Juliet. ( Telephone ringing ) - You answer it. - Hello? - Kyle: Hi, is May there? - Hello, Kyle. I'll have to see if she's here. Hold on. It's for May. May? ( Yelling ) May! - Wally, bring the kids down now! - May: I'm here. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. You're sorry about what? Sorry I have to be here with people like you. Nora: May. It's Kyle. - ( Music playing over telephone ) - Hello? Hey. I called you at your dad's. Why are you at your mom's? He went out of town. Kyle: Do you want to meet me at the lake in an hour? No, I'm busy. You were gonna be with me today. Kyle: Hello? Hello? What are you being such a bitch for? Because I am. ( Handset clatters ) ( music continues ) You can't stay here much longer. Somebody's bound to notice. - People see things. - People see what they want to see. Hey, May, why don't you make us some coffee? Go on, honey. Go on. - Albert: I'll go with her. - It's okay. I'll go. What about the other kid? Go upstairs and get him. Albert: Hey. May I come in? ( Creaking ) Hey, Mike! Mike! Zack! Oh, I don't know if you should be climbing around like that. Hey, that's a big drop... - Hello. - Hi. How you doing? Ls... is Mrs. Cornell in? L-I'm Ed Tallent, her real estate man. Ed: ls something wrong here? Hey! Nothing's wrong, real estate man. Get in here! Ed! Christ, Ed, what the hell are you doing here? Ed, for God's sake. I just came by to tell Nora that there were some problems with the closing, all right? L... l think that there... well, we may not be able to make escrow by Christmas. - Zack, May, go upstairs now. - Zack: Daddy, I... Don't argue with me! Go now! Get outta here! Wally: This is not good, Michael. Tim: Now, look, Ed can stay with us till you go. He won't be a problem. There's a lady raking leaves right across the street. - This is bad, this is very bad... - Michael: Albert! Now's not the time to do something dumb! Albert: I said he cannot stay here. Albert! Look, you won't be here that much longer. Ed can stay with us. He can stay in the basement if you want. We can all stay down there if it makes you easier. Come on, I give you my word. Come on, I swear it. ( Muffled gunshot pops ) ( body thumps ) Now maybe you'll understand. God. Oh, God. Ed. Albert: What if somebody heard? Jesus Christ. Calm down, Albert. Albert, just calm down. - The whole goddamn neighborhood... - He doesn't care about you, Albert. You're not part of his plan. He's going to kill you, too. You know, Albert, you're so dumb. ( Yelling ) I can't take it in here, Michael! We're gonna go right now. And I'm not fooling around. Albert, where'd you get the gun? Where'd you get the gun, Albert? I found it. Michael: Nora. Hey, Nora, did you lie to me? I didn't mean to lie to you. I didn't mean to lie, but you lied to us! You said you'd be gone by midnight! Shut up! Shut up! Michael: God damn it, Albert. Gimme the gun! Gimme the gun! Fuck! No. I can't handle this. It's too much. I'm going. Well, why not? You can go. What are you talking about, Mike? It's best we split up now. Do me a favor before you go, Albert. Get rid of the dead. You mean that... I can go? Yeah. Yeah, you head south. And we'll all meet up in Juarez. What the hell is going on here? What are you doing, Mike? I'm killing two birds with one stone. Timmy and his family want us to leave? Well, then, they're gonna have to help us. - How? - You're gonna have to drop by the bank. 10,000 would be just fine. I don't have that much money. Timmy, you gonna start lying to me again? Someone's gonna have to go with him. He's gonna go straight to the police! - What did I tell you? - What? Stop thinking. He's going all by himself. He's mad, and he's scared. Well, uh... I'll see you guys in Mexico. Mexico. Definitely Mexico. Albert: I've never been alone. Not since... I met Wally when we were little kids. Get the door. ( Engine starts ) There's only one thing for you to think about out there, Timmy. Any red light shows, any sirens... they get it first. - ( Tim groans ) - Not you. Them. - You think about that. - ( Groans ) Good morning, sir. Pardon. - Sorry about that. - She was next. We usually require your wife's signature. - My wife's not well. - I'm sorry. I've been banking here for 14 years. I opened the account myself, and I want to close it out myself. - I'll have to talk to Mr. Nelson. - You do? Good. ( Motorcycle revs ) - Mr. Cornell? - Yeah. You know there's quite a substantial penalty for cashing these certificates out now. I know that, but it's unavoidable, you see? I just need the cash. It's an emergency. Well... if you'll sign right there, I'll cash you out, Mr. Cornell. Cashier's check? Uh, no, cash, please. Cash. Okay. And one more, please. - Thank you. Very kind of you. - It'll be a moment. ( Motor rumbles ) - Here you are, Mr. Cornell. - Thank you. - Please count it. - I'm sure it's okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Next, please. Excuse me. ( Whinnies ) ( horn honks ) - ( tires squealing ) - ( Sirens wailing ) ( sirens wailing ) ( engine whines ) TV announcer: KUTV news bulletin. The FBI announced today it will not file charges against attorney Nancy Breyers in connection with the courtroom escape of accused killer Michael Bosworth. Breyers was not available for comment. We'll keep you posted with further information as it beco... - She's in control. - So why doesn't she call then? - Oh, she will. - She will? ( Chuckles ) What do you find so amusing? You. Wally. Looks like you won the Vietnam War all by yourself, Timmy. ( Clatters ) That's a good boy. - I knew you wouldn't take any chances. - ( Groans ) - What have you got? - I'm not sure. A body's been discovered in the southern part of the county, a real estate agent named Ed Tallent shot at point-blank range. - May mean nothing. - Where was he found? In a riverbed. His car was on the scene about five hours from here. Probably does mean something. Give me the addresses of all his residential listings. Excuse me, ma'am, but it's my opinion this guy Bosworth believes he can escape from anywhere. Now, I'd like to start setting up roadblocks in the area. - Request denied. - ( Helicopter blades whirring ) if Bosworth is in a house somewhere, there sure as hell are hostages. That's the way he plays. Your orders are to wait for me to give you more orders. Thank you, ma'am. Maddox! If you learn anything, don't drift away! I'm just a cheap float in a stormy sea. Woman: Oh, yeah, it was beautiful. It was great. I'll call you later. Albert: Hey. Which way you guys going? Sorry. What college do you go to? - Fuck off. - Oh, come on. I just need a lift a little ways. That's all. - Go away, please! - Oh, come on. Lisa, call the police now! Run! Run! Stay away from me! ( screams ) Police dispatcher: We've got a report of a young man covered in blood - harassing two girls... - ( Tires screeching ) - ( car horn honking ) - We're there. ( Siren wailing ) No. No, no, no! Albert: No! ( Woman shouting ) ( panting ) No. ( Whinnying ) Maddox: You in the water! Drop your weapon! ( Voice echoes ) ...your weapon! ( Whistling tune ) ( whistling echoes ) Hey! You in the water! Drop your weapon! I'm not gonna tell you again! Put the gun down! ( Echoes ) ...the gun down! ( Whistles ) Maddox: Put the gun down! ( Gunfire stops ) That gun the kid was carrying is registered to a Nora Cornell on Whitney Drive, which is right here. Agent: Get me those residential listings. On that call the primary placed from the phone booth, telephone company says it went to a residence... "Timothy and Nora Cornell, 1448 Whitney Drive." ( telephone ringing ) You answer. Start talking. - Hello? - Nancy: ls Michael there? Yes, he is. If this is a trick, you can kiss your family goodbye. - Yes? - Michael? - Nancy? Nancy! - Michael? - Where are you? - Nancy: I'm close. - Did they believe you? - Of course they believed me. Oh, baby, you're brilliant. Oh, you're brilliant! Oh, God, I miss you. We're at 1448 Whitney. How long will it take? Nancy: I think I can get there in less than an hour. All right, you just be careful. You stay calm. - You just think about us together. - Nancy: I will. - I love you. - I love you, too. ( Line clicks, dial tone hums ) ( laughs ) She's on her way. She's on her way. It's almost over, Timmy. I'll be out of here in less than an hour. What about us? Timmy, have I ever broken any promises to you? Man: Out! Let's go! Agent: Where is she? She's in a house, back at the command post. Agent: Okay, let's have it. But make it fast. All right, look... right now, she's officially just an innocent civilian. - No charges. isn't that your deal? - If she cooperates. And if you send her in there and anything happens tonight, they'll have our ugly asses in court tomorrow. No, only one ass is involved... mine. And what's ugly about it? We've got exigent circumstances here. The rules don't apply. We've got a ticket to ride. I just don't think it's worth the chance. The guy is a fucking maniac. He's not afraid to die. Man: Maddox is right, it's only a matter of time before we go tactical on this shithead. Listen closely while I pull rank on you. We're doing it my way. We will discuss it no more forever. ( Slams ) Get it off her. He'll search her. - He trusts me. - Get it off. Remember now, all you have to do is to get him to leave. Once you're well away from here, stop at some restroom down the road. - We'll take it from there. - I understand. If you don't, you know what's gonna happen to you, don't you? I told you, I want to live. - ( Motor roars ) - My knees are shaking. I can hear your knees. You remember... you do this, no charges will be brought against you. You can't turn your back now. If you change your mind now, we're going to take casualties. Nancy: I know. I know! You think she's gonna think straight when she's face-to-face with Bosworth? She's got her brains between her legs. Now I could be inside that house in one minute. Flash-bangs at the door... we make a three-point entry, - it's all over. - We're giving that family a chance. The way they've played along, maybe they don't have any chance coming. You know, Maddox, I've begun to... you just don't give a damn, do you? If it goes sideways, we'll pull out our guns and waste the whole neighborhood! ( Thunder rumbles ) Don't forget to smile when you see him. He... he might want me to... Well, smile when you do that, too. Oh, God. I can't. You can. ( Whimpers ) I-I'm not ready to die. Then you make sure you do just what I told you. W-what happens when we come outside? What if... what if he realizes what I'm doing to him? L... l want a gun, or I won't go in! I won't! ( Motor roars ) I just put my ass on the line. Now, you get outta here. My earrings are killing me. I'm in a real bad mood. You be careful, honey. ( Motors roaring ) I'm passing command to you. You fuck this up, you're gonna leave your badge and your credentials in a manila envelope 'cause I don't wanna see you when I get back. I'm going to the forward observation point. ( Motors roaring ) ( radios crackling ) ( safety brake clicking ) Man: Subject is on the scene. ( Door knocker rapping ) ( gun hammer clicks ) ( door slams ) I know that they tried to get you to betray me. ( Nancy grunting ) Let me introduce you to the Cornells. I got this wacko in my sights. I think I can take him. That's Zack and May and Nora. This is the greatest woman in the world. Nora: My God, what are you doing? You must be insane! - You shut up! - Tim: Zack, go upstairs now. May: Come with me. I'm going to tell you a story. Michael: Nancy, I have something that I want to I want to... I want to give to you. It's gonna keep us together for the rest of our lives. - Nancy: I can't... I can't take it. - This used to be Nora's. - What's going on? - Follow the line and turn around. Just tell me what's going on. I gotta get through to see somebody. We got a problem with the traffic. Now move it! Hey...! Son of a bitch! ( Rock music blaring ) Man on radio: Jesus Christ, we've got company. Man: Goddamn son of a bitch. It's too late. See what he does. - Kyle: May! - Who's that? - ( Knock on door ) - May's boyfriend. May's boyfriend. - ( Knock on door ) - Come on, May, open up! Hi, Kyle. How you doing, kid? Kyle: I'm sorry to stop by so late, but, uh... - Tim: What is it? - May and I had a fight, and, uh... well, if she could go for a ride with me I'd really appreciate it. Tim: Well, she may still be angry, Kyle. I'll ask her. Are these for her? - Yeah. I'll wait for her here. - Okay, you bet. ( Slams ) He wants to take May for a ride, and he won't leave without her. Wally: That's one less we got to worry about. - Well, then you call her. - May! May, come down, please. ( Rapid footsteps ) May? Kyle's outside. He wants to make it up with you. Now you have to go. Now. Go on with him. I'm not leaving unless my mom stays. - Michael: Nora's coming with me. - Tim: What for? Michael: So you don't call the cops on us when we leave. Bosworth, you're so close. Don't blow it. If she doesn't go, Kyle will make a scene. I know it. Let her go, Mike. Please. You and I have a date with destiny, Tim. You'll be coming with me after all. I can trust Nora more than I can trust you. Daddy, what about you? We're gonna win if you do as he says. ( Sobbing ) But I don't wanna, Daddy. I love you. Go. - Go. - Okay. Okay. Michael: You go with your boyfriend, May. You go far away. Otherwise, I'm gonna kill your daddy. ( Faintly ) Okay. Okay. - Kyle: Are you okay? - I'm fine. I don't know what's going on, but let's get out of here. ( Engine roars ) All right, you prove it. You get the car. ( Grunts ) Oh...! ( Hammer clicks ) Mr. Cornell? I'm Special Agent Brenda Chandler, FBI. We're here to help you. No, you can't do that. You'll get my family killed. We're gonna let them drive away. No, I'm going with them... Bosworth and his brother and the girl. - You're hurt! - No, I'm not. I'm okay. - Tim: Eh...? - Don't take long in there. He's going to go suicidal any minute now. Why are you doing that? Just kind of a wild idea. You'll just have to trust me. Mr. Cornell! If we have to go tactical, we're gonna take casualties. Well, that's just one more chance I'm going to have to take, isn't it? - How come I didn't hear the car start? - I got no key. Put your arms up. What is this? Huh? What's this? Huh? What the fuck is this? Tim: I found it on the seat of my car. I was... I'm scared. All right. You get going now. I want to say goodbye to Zack. Daddy! Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, there's people with guns outside. I saw them. I'm scared... Shh, shh, shh. You must be quiet. Listen to me. You've gotta hear this. You've got to speak quietly. Okay, okay. Okay. Daddy, are they going to shoot us? No, no, they're here to help us. Now, I know you're scared. But we mustn't let the men downstairs know. Okay, I'll be back soon. - Tim? - What? - Tim...? - What? There are so many things I want to tell you. And I don't have time to tell you. I know. Me, too. I'll be right back. This place is a tomb. You two get out first. Get in the back. Nancy, baby, I want you to start the engine, don't turn on the lights. - Shit. - ( Weapon clicks ) - Nancy, what's wrong?! - No! Hold it! Hold... ( screams ) Hold it, Bos... ( grunts ) - Where you hit? - Ln the ego! Get me a bullhorn! ( Gunfire crackling ) ( screams ) Mommy, what if they shoot Daddy? - They won't. - Michael: You betrayed me! Nancy: Michael, no! Michael, please! No! Michael: I did all of this for you! You shut up! Shut up! This ain't over. ( Telephone ringing ) You watch him! ( Telephone ringing ) This is Michael Bosworth speaking! So before you start with your bullshit I want a car here to take three... no! Four people to the airport. I want a plane with five hours of fuel. Okay, I'll see what I can do on that. Michael: Don't you start lying to me! I know who's in charge out there! You listen to me! I want all your people out of there in 10 minutes or I'm gonna start killing the whole family! - ( Crashes ) - We can't negotiate him out. There are still four hostages in there. Bosworth needs killing. We don't violate the rules until they don't work. Everyone's alive. So far, this is still a potential win. Someone bring a four-door car to the house... now. Be careful, Zack. Be careful, honey. Okay, Mommy. Don't worry. Lady, this is the sheriff's department! - Mom! - I love you. You'll be okay. Drop him! ( Crashes ) They're gonna get us out of here yet! ( Grenade bangs ) ( screams ) - Tim: Give me the gun. - Nora! Nora! You're dying, Wally. You're dying. You're not going anywhere. Michael: Nora! ( Bangs ) Nora! Give me the gun. Give me the gun! ( Nancy whimpers ) Nora! God damn it! - Get over here! - No! No! No! ( Sobbing ) I've decided I love your family too much. You're all coming with me. The more the merrier, right? You're through, Bosworth. It's over. You stay right there, or you're gonna kill your wife. - Tim! - It's okay, Nora. ( Gasps ) Tim! I'm still in control, Timmy. Nora: Tim! Nothing can happen to you, Nora. If you never trusted me before, you have to trust me now. I'll blow her brains right across the room! You know what size hole this caliber bullet makes when it comes out the other side, Timmy? He can't hurt you, Nora. He can't hurt you, honey. ( Gun clicks ) ( doors slam ) ( gun clicking ) Chandler: Your car is waiting, Bosworth. Do not move! Stay down! ( Whirring ) Do not move! We'll come to you! ( Yells ) Clay, get her out of here, will you? ( Camera clicking ) ( May sobbing ) ( sobbing within ) ( instrumental music playing )
