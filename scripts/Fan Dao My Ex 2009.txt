Of course not! Ken's new woman. What is this? Is this your new whore? Did you already sleep with her? Meen, please calm down. Why? - You promised that you're not going to look at other women. - No It's not what you think. I'm not ready to have a baby. Are you sure that it's mine? Bastard! Meen. "I've asked myself many times. Are we really supposed to have only one true love?" "What if I find a new true love? Would that be so wrong? I'm just an ordinary guy." "If I have the chance to choose my true love ...why shouldn't I choose?" "...take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife and promise to be faithful, in sickness and in health," "...to love and to honor for all eternity." I do. Cut! Let's move on to the next scene. Thank you. OK. Hey! Hey! What the hell? How could you let it drop? Sorry. Don't drop it again or someone might get hurt! When are we going to hear the good news? Ken? Ploy? Isn't the fact that we're dating each other... considered a good news? But didn't the fortune teller said that you guys are not soul mates? Well, I don't know. I never believe in those sort of things. But someone saw Ken still going out with Meen and Bow. What is that about? - What are you guys talking about? - You got us all confused. Ploy, what do have to say about that? It's not true! Hungry? No. Bastard. What are you doing? I told you to stop taking the picture. Stop following me! Ken. No. Don't make a scene. Stop! Let's just leave. Don't pay attention to all those nonsense gossip. You can't trust these people. The paper said that "someone" knows the truth. For once, I would like to know who is this "someone" these people are talking about? If I can't trust what they say... then who did this to your car? It was probably that stupid guy who took our picture. He probably wrote up the story. What about Meen and Bow? It's just the same old news. Gossip is gossip. I promise that I won't let it happen again. I only want to be with you. I'm booked for the whole month. You can talk to my agent to set up the schedule. OK. Goodbye. Hello. Ken. Ken. Ken. Hello. Ken. Hello. Hello. Hello. Ken? Who the hell? Why called if you're not going to say anything. What is this flower doing in here? Whose is it? I don't know ...I don't know how it got here. Are you okay? Ken. I just saw a woman. I'm scared. What? That's ridiculous. There's only me and you. C'mon smile. You were just dreaming. "Actually, I'm just an ordinary guy. I am no different than other men." "I'm just living my life. It's normal to date someone and then break up." "I think it's very normal. Sure I've dated several women. But, each time though..." "I've always been honest and I did tried my very best." So don't you care when women say that you are selfish?" "Everybody has their share of selfishness. I cannot make everybody happy." Why did you turn it off? Why do you want to watch it? The real me is sitting right here. Just ask me anything. I want to know if I am "the one" for you. C'mon answer. - Yes or no? - Of course, you are. Well, how would you know if later I've turned out not to be "the one"? Ken. Huh! I promise that you will be the only and the last woman for me. OK? Will you get bored of me? If I have to stay with you just like this forever and not leave, then I'll be happy. Don't you ever forget what you've just said. If you break your promise, I'll torture you to death. Torture me? Then I would die for you right now. Not now. I feel so sticky. I'm going to take a bath. I'm coming in. No. Why not? Didn't you just said that you'll torture me to death? Don't you want to bathe? Turn around. Ouch! Calm down Ploy. What is it? Ken. There's someone in the room. Where? I don't see anybody. Ploy. What is going on? I know about the car incident. Our office was trashed as well. Just forget about it. I think it just some sick person doing all of this. I think it could be one of your ex who did this. Maybe it is Meen. That bitch wouldn't leave you alone, even when she knows that you're now with someone else. Can't blame her though. The news about me dating Ploy are just plastered all over. Don't make excuses for her. And you, you should be more careful with whom you sleep with. Especially that psychopath. I've tried to stop you and you went and slept with her anyway. Anything else? If not, then I'm going to hang up. Oh, wait. Since, the production is done. I'm thinking of going down to the house in Hua Hin Province for a week. Ken. We're going to have a baby. What? Are you crazy? Are you kidding me? I'm just not ready. Are you sure that it's mine? Bastard! Hi Ken. Hi. I'll clean up right away. I didn't know that you were coming. How many of you? I'll prepare meals for you. It's okay, it's just me. I'll take up the bags. Jibb, what are you doing? There's someone in the car. Where? I don't see anybody. C'mon. I have to get to work. You're just so slow. Ken. I've finished cleaning up. If there's nothing else, then I'm going home. Meen. How did you get here? Are you surprised? I'm sorry that I got really upset that day. I have a good news. I got rid of the baby. Aren't you happy to see me? Yes. I miss you so much. You know? Ploy. How did you get here? What were you doing? What took you so long. No. Nothing. And why didn't you tell me that you were coming? What about you? You didn't tell me either. Are you hiding someone in there? No. Ploy. Ken. Huh? What happened to your back? Where? Right here. Oh, I got cut by some tree branch earlier. I think that's how I got cut. It's nothing. What's up with you today? Why are you asking me so many questions? Do you want to be a reporter? OK, I will answer you in every positions and angles. So nosy. Won't you smile for me? Hello. King, is that you? What's up? Do you have any hot pics for me? No hot pics. Just weird ones. I'm running a gossip magazine here, not some magazine about weirdos. They're pictures of celebrities, Ken and Ploy ...and something else. None sense! I don't want any ghost pictures. But I believe that they're worth being front page material. Then people will starts speculating and say that I've retouched those pictures. And in the end I'll end up on the front page myself, getting sued. Listen, I want you to take pictures of celebrities, not ghosts. Understood? OK, picture of celebrities only. I'll send them out. Bye. Ken. Ken. C'mon. Don't run too fast. Ouch. Are you okay? I'm fine. Bastard. Still hurt? A little. You're okay? Do you think it's okay? I have to leave. I have an event and can't be late. Ploy, I've decided... ...about our engagement. When I get back, I'll make it public. Are you sure? Yes. Call me when you get home. OK. Bye. Forgot something? What? Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Drive safe. Where were you last night? I called and you wouldn't answer. I was with Ploy. Oh, enough sleeping around with all those girls. It's now all over the tabloids! Did you tell Meen that I was coming here? No. Why? Did she goes and cause trouble? Not exactly. All of a sudden, she just showed up here and then disappeared when Ploy came. Then that's good that they didn't bump into each other. What was she doing there anyway? We haven't really talked yet. Then what were you guys doing? Anyway, let me know if she shows up again. So I can take care of it once and for all. You just don't have the gut and get things done. For someone like Meen, you just have to be blunt. Hey. Hey. What? Nothing. I got to go. Hello? Hello? Ken? It's only been 5 minutes and you already miss me? Stop fooling around. I was talking to the client. They want us for an event. But, they couldn't get through to you, so, they want to know if you're available? It's up to you. Okay then. Thanks Honey. He's mine! This is not going to help. Meen, I have... ...something to tell you. What? Well... Hello. What's up? Do you know what happened to Ploy? Wait a minute. What? What is it? Ken. Ploy is dead. What? She crashed her car into the bridge while driving back. Now the police wants to talk to you. Because you were the last one that she called. Good news? Are you crazy? She died at the hospital. I'll let you know if there's anything else. Thank you for your cooperation. Ken. Did the police say that it was an accident or was it a murder? Does it have anything to do with your ex-girlfriends? Please don't ask him any questions. He's still in shock. If we find out anything further, we'll hold a press conference. Excuse us. I really don't want to start working right now. I need some time off. OK. We'll wait until we've sort out everything. If there's nothing else. I would like to go back to the house in Hua Hin Province. OK. Drive carefully. Just go ahead, ditch the press and meet me at the office. Ken. You still have the nerve showing up here? Ken. You want your cover page, huh! Ken. Ploy is dead. Isn't that enough? Stop it! - Ken, - What more do you want? Just leave before the press get here. Trust me. Go! Go to the office and wait for me. Please, go. I apologize on behalf of Ken. But, you shouldn't have come and tried to interview him now. I'm not here to do an interview. But I have something for you to see. What? It's the pictures that I took of Ken and Ploy and someone else. Ken, Ploy and someone else. Are you blackmailing us? I'm not that much of an asshole. I took these pictures 2-3 days ago. I checked... ...and there's something wrong with these pictures. Have Ken take a look at it. It's obviously been retouched! Meen. You are everywhere! You just won't stop! Hello Is this you, "een? This is Nimirt. I would like to know when the hell are you going to leave... Ken alone? I'm warning you. Don't push me or you're going to be in a lot of trouble! Hello. Meen? Meen? Are you listening? - Hello? Hello? "At 5pm today, - Meen! Hello? - A body was discovered inside a condominium in Sukhumvit." "After further investigation, the police found the deceased to be 'Miss Meentra'," - "the daughter of a politician..." - Hell no! "Who had recently dated an a-list movie star, Ken." Suicide. Hello? "From the initial investigation, it reveals that the cause of death was suicide." "She has been dead for at least 3 days." Hello. Ken. Where are you? What's going on? I'm here at your house. I'm out buying some stuff and cigarettes. Just hurry back... I need to talk to you. Be quick! Hello. Hello. He has to see these pictures. Where the hell is he? I want to talk to Ken not you! I told you that he's not here. I can see his car parking outside. He's got to be here. The car is broken. I am not stupid. You dumb bitch! He doesn't want to see you anymore. Don't you get it? - But, he has to take his responsibility! - What responsibility? Both of you did it together. He didn't do it alone! I think you'd better leave before I have you dragged out by the security. "Nimirt." Sorry, the number you've dialed cannot be reached at this time. Meen. Bow, I promise that you'll be the only and the last woman for me. If Meen hears this, wouldn't she be angry? No, I broke up with her already. Why didn't you keep your promise? Meen, I didn't mean ...to hurt you. In two years, if thing gets better... would you marry me? Are you serious? Why would I joke around? I promise... ...that you'll be the only... ...and the last woman in my life. Why are you blushing? Why didn't you keep your promise? In the past, I've never lied to you. I really loved you. I did love you Meen. Meen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. "Lun-Tome Tree." Meen. The name of this tree is bad omen. Nonsense! It's a good name, but the people mistook the meaning for "sorrow." But the princess changed the new name to "Lee-La-Wa-Dee." I think it's beautiful. Just let him know how many you want. We can have them planted it at the house next week. I just want only one. Huh? Because, I have only one true love. I love you. I love you too. Really? I promise... ...that you'll be the only... ...and the last woman in my life. "I've asked myself many times." "Are we really supposed to have only one true love?" "What if I find a new true love? Would that be so wrong?" "I'm just an ordinary guy. "If I have the chance to choose my true love ...why shouldn't I choose?"
