We hear in our media how our future may not be as great as our past. We're caught up in making a living instead of designing our lives. We forgot what we're capable of. Let me tell you the truth. The future will be what we decide to make it. There are people who will succeed in making a difference. They live with passion. They're doing things differently than people living in fear. It's a glorious day, isn't it? Hello, Father. Lieutenant Ambrose. We'd like to speak with Mrs. Winterbourne. - That would be me. - Patricia Winterbourne? She's my daughter-in-law. What is this regarding? The murder of Steven DeCunzo. Then you'll want to speak with me. Why is that? I'm the one who killed him. Oh, my! Oh, my! Steve DeCunzo. That's a name I'd rather forget. Let's go back to the beginning. My name's Connie Doyle. I grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey. Mom died when I was 12. Dad and I just didn't get along. At 18, I decided to give us both breathing room. Besides, Ma always said: "Destiny is waiting for you. You just gotta go find it." If you're looking for fate, try New York City. And guess who I met that very first day? Hi. What's that behind your ear? - Neat. - Steve DeCunzo. It's nice. But it don't say what you do. Good cards don't do that. It's too showy. - See, I'm an agent. - Wow! For who? I'm not at liberty to say. It's professional ethics. How old are you? Eighteen. Today's my birthday. You're shitting me. You seem so mature. - Really? - That's it. We gotta celebrate. Happy birthday! For me? Steve assured me I was both beautiful and unappreciated. The last thing a teenage girl wants to hear. Yeah, I fell for it. Moved right in with him. What the hell... It was okay for a while. Maybe he didn't give me flowers, but... I sure had my pick of stolen car radios. The important thing was, he took care of me. And he didn't ask for too much in return. But if this was supposed to be my big destiny thing... I was expecting a little more. Come on, Ma. Give me a sign. I'm pregnant! Isn't that great? What do you mean you're pregnant? What do you mean, "What do I mean"? I took a test and it came out positive. We're gonna have a baby! You're gonna tell me it's mine? - Of course it is. I mean, who else? - Don't give me that shit! You screwed Connie, didn't you? No, man, never. I said, "Did you screw Connie?" Sure, I did. Yeah, lots. Slut. - Get rid of it. - I'm not getting rid of it! So ends my brief history with men. After that, I just kept getting bigger. They fired me as a waitress. The uniform didn't fit. So I blew my money on luxuries like food and toothpaste. My time at the Y ran out. I was about to spend the night on the streets. Now I got this baby to think about, and I just can't let that happen. It's Connie! I'm about to have your baby in the street. Come watch! Steve's out at the moment. Hey! I need a place to stay! You owe me that! - This ain't home! - You owe me! You don't want me to come down there. - I want you to come down here! - I will! - Come on down then! - I'm not coming down! I'm telling you, I got no place! I got no money! Here. You wanted to have a baby? Fine. Have it in the street. That's it, Steve! Jesus Christ. Unbelievable. Don't try to blow me off like that. Get over here. I'll help you pray. Give an old man a quarter? No? I'll help you to your train. Get your hands off me. Don't touch me! Nobody touches me! Somebody touched you. Here. I was saving it. But, go on, take it. Gee. And here's a shelter on the West Side. I mean, they pray at you, but the food's okay. Thanks. Wait a second! - Look out! - Hold it. Wait. Board! This ain't the subway! Let me out! - Hey, where does this train go? - Boston. Tickets! Tickets! Tickets! - Mister, please! - Ticket! My husband must have it. Steve! Ticket. I have her tickets, sir. Told you I had a husband. Of course she has. I mean, look at her. Or are you implying something about my wife? No, sir! Sorry, sir. Wow, thanks! I've had a rough couple of days. We're not really married, are we? No, we're not. You look very thirsty. Would you like a soda? - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Let's go sit down. - Really? I'm telling you, you'll never find a seat. I had no idea it would be this crowded. I forgot about spring break. Those college days seem a million miles away. Don't they ever? Patricia. Hugh. Is there something I should know? I picked up a pregnant woman in the club car. He has a thing for us. Did you get my drink? - He gave it to me. - I like her better than you. Would you get me another one? Why not? I mean, who knows? Maybe I'll get lucky again. Play nice. - Hi. - My name's Connie. Oh, man! I'm sorry. It's all right. That's okay. Hardly anything. I'll clean that right up. Here. I'm so sorry. I've got... Here. Here we go. - Here. - There, got it. No problem. So, how far along are you? Oh, I don't know. Twelve, 13 months. You know, you are my first American conversation. - I've lived in Hong Kong since I was 8. - Yeah? We throw soda now. It's a new thing. Anyway, I'm gonna meet Hugh's family. I'm so nervous. Oh, my God! You're soaked, aren't you? Put it on. - Yeah? - Oh, I insist. Anyway, my dad was a banker. About a year ago, my dad died. I didn't know what I was going to do. I didn't have anybody. I don't even remember my mom. I'm sorry. Feet get big when you're pregnant. I haven't seen feet this big since I saw the Knicks. Well, look at my fingers. Like hot dogs. I gotta get this ring off. - Shoot! - Oh, no! "Dear Penthouse, I thought it would be a lonely ride..." There's an empty table. If we move right now, we can eat. Yes? Be right there. - He'll kill me if I lose it. - I'll get it. - I got it. - Good. Wow. God, it's beautiful. Thank you. Thanks. - That's so sweet. - Go ahead, try it on. - Isn't that bad luck? - I couldn't have bad luck. We gotta go. Here. My baby. - My baby! - Careful, honey. - Where's my baby? - Your baby's fine. - What? - Your baby's fine. I wanna see him. Her, it, whatever! We'll see what we can do. What you can do is bring me my baby, that's what. Right. Jeez. There you are. It's so sweet. Just like a little cookie. Hey, leave me alone! I know what I'm doing! Mommy doesn't really know what she's doing. She was lying. Two legs. Two arms. Hands. Toes. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Eleven? No, no. Ten toes. Oh, you're my little boy. You be careful with that, cookie. Those things can do a lot of damage. Nice digs. Look at the nice stuff. Oh, shit! Nurse! Miss! Miss, you brought me the wrong goddamn baby! It's too bad. You're a nice one. Miss! What...? - Mrs. Winterbourne? - What? - How're you feeling? - You guys got this all screwed up! Wouldn't be a first. Remember the accident? I was in a train wreck! Who'd forget a train wreck? - How long have I been here? - About eight days. Holy crap! Where's here? You're at St. Declan Hospital in Stamford, Connecticut. There was another pregnant lady on the train. Did you know her? Did? Oh, Jesus, God! - Is she dead?! - Mrs. Winterbourne... Will you please stop calling me that! What's that? What the hell is this?! Nothing. Something to relax you. I don't need to relax! I need to straighten this... Wait. Where're you going with him? Listen to me. I'm not... That feels nice. - Would you like onion rings with that? - Yes. Did Dr. Hopley say we could walk? There's something important I must tell you. Are we gonna have a bad day? I thought we'd have a good day. We'll be good. It'll be good. I sounded hysterical before, so you didn't wanna listen to me. I'm gonna be real calm... when I tell you there's been one major screw-up! - Is that so? - Yes, it's so! Look, I gotta talk to Hugh! Oh, no! Not him too! Oh, God, no! No! Found this card in her purse. Connie Doyle? - No, I'm sorry. I never heard of her. - How'd she get your card? I give those to every chick I meet. You should try it. - I'll remember that. - Sorry I couldn't help you out. It feels good to be here tonight! Yeah, 39 million people watching me! It feels real good to be here! Connie's dead. - Who's Connie? - The bitch who hollered at the window. Example of Dianetics! - Dead? - Yeah. She was gonna have my baby. Makes you think, doesn't it? Dead, dead, dead! There's something mysterious about the secret squares! That Bobcat Goldthwait is so funny! I am every parent's dream! Okay, cookie. We're going. Whose telephone is that? Is that your telephone, Mrs. Winterbourne? Is everything okay? Is everything okay, Mrs. Winterbourne? - Aren't you gonna answer? - Is that it? I thought it was a ringing in my ears! - Hello? - Hello? This is Mrs. Winterbourne. - What? - Hugh's mother. Patricia? - I feel so awful about this. - I know, we all do. Yeah. No. Jesus, this is difficult. I wanted to see you. The doctors say I can't travel. I'm surprised they don't chain you. You don't have to talk now, dear. You don't have any family here, so consider our house... That's nice, but... I'm your mother-in-law. Don't argue. That's my grandson you've got there. - Well... - I've sent a car for you. - No, no, you can't do that! - ...be expecting you. - Mrs. Winterbourne? - No. - That's what it says. - Don't believe that. Holy shit! - What's this? - This is a Rolls-Royce. That's like the Cadillac of automobiles, huh? No, the Mercedes Benz is the Cadillac of automobiles. This is a Rolls-Royce. Hey, look, I gotta explain something... You don't explain to me. I'm just Paco. You explain to Mrs. Winterbourne. Okay, Mrs. Winterbourne? Do I look the way you expected me to? Not really. Hugh was always stuck on blonds. You know, tall and sophisticated. Yeah, he got tired of those. So he never sent any pictures of me? Hugh didn't like cameras. You have to develop the film, remember to pick it up. Too much responsibility. That's Hugh. - Poor boy. - Yeah. Oh, my God! - This is not right. Tell her... - Hello, Patricia. - Something terrible's happened. - Yes, I know. I know you had something terrible happen... but your terrible thing and mine are two different things. I understand. You lost a husband and I lost a son. You wanna hold... My grandson. It's been so long since I've done this. You're doing fine. What did you name him? - Cookie. - Pardon? I was just trying it out. I haven't decided. Have you thought of Hugh? He looks just like him. Okay. Sure. Fine. Hugh it is. I miss him so much. Mother? Okay. That's enough. - Good to see you. - What's wrong? - I just... I gotta go. - I don't understand. It was nice, really. Didn't he tell you he had a twin? Yes, but I didn't know he was identical. That must've been a shock. I'm just still so confused from that train wreck. Of course. Anyone with a brain would be sensitive to that. Thank you, Mother. I'm Bill. I wish we could've met under pleasant circumstances. - No, this is okay. - I meant, before the accident. Oh, right. Right, right, right. Would you like to hold your nephew? He's a lovely child, Bill. Luckily, he doesn't look like us. Oh, Bill. Come with me, Patricia. I'll never get away with this. Oh, Mother Winterbourne. Hello. That's what I first called my mother-in-law. She seemed so cold. What'd you end up calling her? Mother Winterbourne. She was cold. I had these made when Hugh said you were coming. Old pictures of the boys to torment you with during our visit. They're cute. Hugh was very embarrassed by this one of him naked. Except for the cowboy hat. You're only in college once, I suppose. Well. I cannot cry anymore. - Call me Grace. - Grace. Yes. He's so adorable. Well. Thank you for keeping this one safe. Thank you. Can Mommy go to prison for this? Can you say 5-to-10? Where'd he find her? Where'd they meet? - What do you mean? - Well, she's hardly in his... - Class. - Frankly, yes. The water, Mother. Admit it, there's a bit of white trash on the edges. How'd I ever raise such a snob? It's a mystery, Mother. Let's ask the servants. I demand that you at least give her a chance. I'm sorry. Does it sound like I prejudged her? "White trash"? No, no. - Is that a derogatory term? - I'm serious, Bill. Maybe she's a wonderful, down-to-earth all-American girl. But what do we know? Nothing! Except that Hugh brought her, expecting us to welcome her... with open arms. If he wasn't dead, you'd be screaming at him. You can be insensitive sometimes. Sometimes? I must be slipping. You know what you need? "You Are Here" maps. They're all waiting for you. What do you mean, "all"? Who's all waiting? Just family. Mrs. Winterbourne, Bill and the Father. I'm dying to meet him. He never stopped talking about him. Father Brian is the Monsignor. Hugh's father died. Right. That's when she got sick. The husband, then Hugh. Too much. Sorry I was late. I got lost. I've been coming here for years, and I still get lost. - This is Father Brian Kirrane. - How's it going? - Pleased to meet you. - It's a pleasure. Hugh spoke of you often, and with affection. Oh, that's so touching. I haven't seen him since his first communion. Oh, well, it made a big impression. He was a fine man. He'll be missed. Thank you. And thank you for so generously welcoming me here. Hey! What's with the hands? May I take the baby? He stays here! He'll bawl his head off if my tits aren't handy. Sorry, Father. Breasts. No, "tits" is fine. Isn't it, Father? Oh, yes. "Tits." "Tits" is fine. Fine. When Bill and Hugh were small... the diaper truck would take the diapers away. But now everything's disposable. The trucks would drive up. Yeah. The men would come out with these huge sacks. - Your pills. - I took them. Before. - Take your pills. - Who works for who here? No! No! Give it. - Give it. - Let go. No! You must watch her every minute. Oh, shoot! Man, I'm sorry. - Look at this. - It's no problem. The clothes are a little big. - After the baby I lost a little... - Height? Mother says I was rude and unfriendly when we met. You weren't rude. Just unfriendly then? That's good. Gives us something to build on. Forgive Bill. He hasn't yet mastered conversational skills. So, where in Hong Kong did you meet? The mall. - The mall? - Sure. Hong Kong's a happening place. They got 7-Elevens, Popeye's Fried Chicken. Great Chinese food. You ought to go. Thanks. Hey, Father, want some? - You with the hands again! - That's my job. It's all right. Really. She'll be around in a minute. Get it later. Dining ritual is different in Hong Kong. - We use chopsticks. - And you eat out of paper boxes. Paris must've been ideal for a wedding, Patricia. Oh, yes. So French. Tell us about the wedding. Well, it was beautiful. Could you elaborate? Real beautiful. Right there in France, which is real beautiful, you know? I would've been there, had he picked up the phone. It was spur-of-the-moment. I don't blame you. Hugh just didn't think about it. I know he wasn't always responsible. It may have looked like thoughtlessness. But to me, and I know I knew him such a short time... there was a kindness about him that was sweeter... because it was so thoughtless. He was one of the only people who was kind without a reason. Not because he wanted something but just because. You understood him. I never did. I thought there'd be time to figure him out. He talked about you all the time. He'd say: "We look alike, that's why we act so different." I thought he didn't tell you. He did. Of course he did. It was just when I saw you it slipped my mind. - Of course it did. We understand. - But why lie about it? When I saw you I was so confused. This house... I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I have to lie down. I'm going to my room. - What were you doing? - Her answers weren't consistent. This is not a cross-examination. She's been through hell. She's covering something up. I mean, look at her! A banker's daughter? My ass! Sorry, Father. No, "ass" is fine. Right? Well, in Judges chapter 15 Samson smote... the Philistines with the bone of an ass. I think that was ass in a different... - "Ass" is fine. - She's hiding something. She's Hugh's widow, and she has just given birth... to my grandson under tons of metal. I don't care if she's a drug lord, I'm gonna help her! Unless you treat her with respect I'll take you and spank you! - And don't think I can't do it! - Paco. My money's on her. "I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth." This is our faith. This is the faith of the church. We are proud to profess it. - "In Christ Jesus, our Lord." - Jesus, our lob. I believe in one homely epileptic jerk. Hugh... Donald... Arthur Winterbourne... the Second. I baptize you in the name of the Father... and of the Son... and of the Holy Spirit. You found the secret passageway. Very clever. Is that it? I thought I was lost again. Ready for the party? - Party? - Yes. We're having a few people over to celebrate the christening. I guess I can handle a few people. - Thank you very much. - He's right. So that's Patricia. Not who I pictured for Hugh. No. I was surprised you didn't call me. Come. There's so many old fogies here. Meet people your age. - You'll have more in common. - I'll bet. Oh, you have a beautiful little son. Thanks. Isn't he great? I was just telling Susan... that I have to know who does your hair. My dear, it is so bold. I was hoping you could give me makeup tips. Your look's so dynamic. I'm too conservative, is my problem. That nail polish with that lipstick. Where'd you get that tip? From a magazine? - Oh, listen. - What? - It's Hugh's favorite song. - He was always whistling it. - We used to sing it all the time. - Did you? Excuse me. Now I know this sounds silly... but Hugh and I used to play this song. Can I sing it to the baby? That'd be great! Thanks. Come on, my precious. You know, you really ought to let Patricia sing too. Yes, I hear she has a wonderful voice. Come on. Thank you. - Bye! - Good luck. Wonderful. I was hoping your mother would get up and sing. Yeah, she has to come out of her shell. - Now, take it. - Me? Street! I can hear it. Did you, Mama? Sing them blues! You tell them! I wouldn't worry. You're damn close. Be careful with him! I am. - I loved your lyrics. - Yeah. Didn't understand, but they were wonderful. What a singular interpretation. Oh, fuck off! You heard her. Fuck off. - I didn't know the song, okay? - So what? I love that, what do you call it, rap? Everyone expected me to know it. What do you care what people think? Really. That's nice of you, but I don't belong here. I mean, look at me! I am looking at you. You're fine. This is fine? Of course. Maybe we could do something with the hair. Let's... Maybe... Actually... And the clothes, they don't fit. It could be a better style. The shoes... I don't like these. The makeup. This was a bit much. And I didn't like the nails. I don't like this... Excuse me. Forgive me, I never had a daughter. That's all right. I barely had a mother. Hello, darling! How are you? Get in touch with banking contacts we have. - Mrs. Winterbourne. - How are you? - So nice to see you. - Thanks. Hi, Mother. What brings you here? Well... Come in. - Hello, Bill. - Patricia. Are you free for lunch? Well, you're not now. Take her somewhere nice. - Maybe I should go home with you. - I'm not going home. And you are dressed to go out. So, Bill, take her out. If you don't wanna do this, I can catch a cab. Believe me, I'd never hear the end of it. It's great to see a grown man afraid of his mommy. - This is really a beautiful city. - Isn't it? Let me take you on my Freedom Trail tour... through historic Boston, past Paul Revere's house... Can we go to the "Cheers" bar? I'll pretend I didn't hear that. I love that show. Norm? Norm's great. - Paul Revere's house. - What happened between you and Hugh? Well, Father started us in the company together. When he retired he was gonna hand the reins to both of us. They called a meeting of the board where they'd pass the torch. Hugh and I stood at the door, waiting to go in... and Hugh turns to me and says, "Wait a minute"... and he walks down the hallway. - And? - And he didn't come back. Three months later, I get a postcard from Taiwan. - It says, "How'd it go?" - You're still mad at him. I had to take responsibility. He got a woman pregnant and married her. That's more than most would do. - That woman would be you, right? - Yeah, sure. So, are you hungry? - I am supposed to buy you lunch. - Yeah. Hi. - Hello. - Hi. The wine list. - Wait a sec. - How long has that been there? It's been there since I met you. I must look silly. - No, you could use some silly. - You think so? Shouldn't you be getting back? I've already blown off the afternoon appointments. Mind if we walk around more? No, I don't mind at all. Hang on. There you go. The first time I was here, Paco brought us. In the 4th grade and me and Hugh were bombing history. He said, "You wanna know history, you gotta go where it happened." Why Paco? Why didn't your dad bring you? Well, let's see. That was when Father was away on business mostly. Our childhood, it's called. Paco goes into the gift shop and buys us these... paper minuteman hats. And a couple of those guns, those muskets. We went nuts! We take off, go through this park... through traffic. He's screaming in Spanish. He's going, "Look both ways! Look both ways!" We came barreling down here. We had such a good time. Hugh runs ahead of me. He's Revere, and I'm a Redcoat... and he's screaming, "My brother's coming!" You miss him. He was a delightful guy. He didn't have any problems because he didn't want to. It was that easy for him. Oh, can we go in? It's my mom. I wanna put this on a chain. - Of course. - Okay. May I? - There we go. - It's nice, but it's so expensive. Didn't Mom give you the account? Yeah, but she just shoves this checkbook at me. Then write a check. It'll be your first. I'm glad I was here for it. There you go. Oh, darn it! I wrote the wrong date. - Let me write another. - Of course. Mother, we need to talk. Tyson. What brings you here? Grace asked me to make a new will to include her daughter. - She has? - Yeah. - You can't. - Billy, don't start. I found out something about Patricia. - You're investigating her? - Mother. - Can we talk later? - Hi. You wanted to see me? Patricia, this is my attorney, Ty Winthrop. Don't hold it against me. I've decided to change my will to include you and your son. What? - I don't want you to do that! - Why not? It's not right. - But you're family. - Don't put my name on that thing! That's not what I came here for. Tell her she's crazy. What about your son? I know you want the best for Hughie. So do I. Don't you see? That's why I'm here. I mean, I'm here because of you. And you. Because you took us in. Not because of the money! I'm not here for the money! My God, of course not! And no one thinks that. Does any one here think that? Please. Maybe it sounds crazy, but I don't want you to sign it! Well, it's my money and I want to sign it. In fact, I wanna sign it more now than before. - You had something to tell me? - No. - Mrs. Winterbourne? - Yeah? I'm sorry. It's Paco. It was the pool repair man. Paco thought it was true love. I could tell the bastard was out for a good time. All right. - What'll you do? - Get him out. I can't believe... Come on. Give me your hand. Let's go. - Come on. - I'll lead. And he was a lousy tile man too. See? Come right off. What's he singing? - Don't you know the tango? - No. I taught my boys the tango... so they could woo all the women. Woo the women! She's a women! Woo her! Really, I'm such an old fart. No. Come on, we'll make a Paco taco. Hi, Mrs. W. She's a nice girl. Don't you think so? - You dance with the girl. - I'll dance. Good night. Night. - Music! - Paco! Dance! Tango! Tango! Tango! I don't know what's going on, but I feel good. So... good night. Good night. I just remembered. I don't live here. I live... somewhere else. Did I say good night? Night. I parked the car out front, not out back. I'm gonna have to get the car out front. I do not understand men. You and me both, honey. - What do you think of her? - She's terrific. I think I think so too. I think I like her. Is that okay? I mean, she's my brother's widow, maybe. Maybe not. But we can leave that for now. Shouldn't I be feeling guilty? - I don't know what I'm feeling. - Happy? Could be. Could be happy. Could be an aneurism. Is this wrong? Worried what Hugh would think? Look... whatever went on, he wanted you to be happy. Really. Has someone been smoking in here? Don't tell Paco, please. I'll never hear the end of it. Give me that. You know you shouldn't be doing that. So, how's it going with you two? - Nothing special. - I see. Got some mail. Your old friends are looking you up. - What's wrong? Bad news? - No, no. Junk mail. - That's too bad. - Would you excuse me? Certainly. Don't cry. It's okay. Someone knows about us. Everything's gonna work out fine. Don't laugh. Mommy's in denial. It's all she's got. It was pretty good while it lasted, cookie. We weren't stupid enough to think it would last forever. That's about everything. Let's change you and we're out of here. Hi. Are you going somewhere? Yeah, I gotta go. I've worn out my welcome. I don't think so. I think you're still welcome. Is it my fault? Is this about the other night? The kiss? You thought I came on to you. That was a brother-in-law kiss. These are for Mom. You can't go. There're things I gotta take care of. I thought you said you didn't have family. I don't. Do you have a job? A home? All right, you've made a decision. I respect that. As a businessman, I have to make decisions. I like to think up a list of pros and cons. Why don't we do that? Make a list, call it column A, column B. Column A is going, column B staying. Column A: If you leave us, you will have: No family, no money. You won't take our money. You have nowhere to go. I'll write in "nothing." In Column B, which is staying. If you stay, you're gonna have a comfortable home... somewhere to raise a child. Write that down. You'll have a mother who loves you... a butler who loves you. How many people can say that? - And me who loves you. - What? Don't interrupt. Where was I? Me. Me asking you to marry him. I put that on top of the list. Oh, God. Or I could just take it off altogether. No problem. Easily done. Let's recap, shall we? Here we have column B. Security, home, love. Weighed up against column A. Nothing. Tough decision, that one. Wouldn't wanna be in your shoes. - Did you just ask me to marry you? - Kind of. Shit. I imagined the moment would be just like this. Don't answer now. Say yes tomorrow. These really were for you. Do you mind if I step into your office? Do me a favor. Can you talk to her? She listens to you. Tell her we're gonna have a great time. I'll take you to ball games. We'll watch the Red Sox. It'll be a bonding sort of thing. I guess now you have to marry me. Oh, cookie... you could never screw up your life as bad as I screwed up mine. Patricia! What are you doing here? - Leave me alone. - Why're you running away? I'm not running away. I'm leaving in a hurry. What do you think? This is some kind of joke show? I wanna know where you're going. I wanna know now! Paco, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's over. I got things in my past that could destroy this family. - You're not the only one with a past. - Bring that back! You know what they do to men like me in Cuba? You got a choice between jail and a boat in a lot of water. I pick the water. I came here to make myself into a new Paco. Instead, I starve. I do things... I don't even wanna know about myself. Then Mrs. Winterbourne, she find me, give me this job. This job saved my life. This family saved my life. - They're strong. - You don't understand. If bad things are going to happen... let them happen here. The family will be there for you. Winterbournes stick together. And whatever else you are, you are a Winterbourne. That's just it. I'm not. Listen to me! I don't know you. I don't know where you come from. But I know this: You are as much a Winterbourne as I am. Board! Go. Go! - Jesus. We thought you were gone. - How is she? She's had another attack. Thank goodness you're home. Are you all right? Oh, damn. Damn, damn, damn. If it weren't for this body, I'd live forever. Now, what do you have to say for yourself, young lady? Grace, I don't fit in here. Nobody fits in here. - You do. - But I didn't at the beginning. Guess what I did when I met Bill's dad. What? I was starring in a hit Broadway musical. - You're kidding? - Yes, I was in the chorus. It folded in one week. But I had potential. But... I met Bill's father and I fell in love. And... I didn't fit in here. I made them fit me. - I don't think I can do that. - Yes, you can. You can do anything. You made Bill come to life. I never thought I'd see anybody do that. Why did you run away? Bill asked me to marry him. Doesn't move slowly, does he? You don't want to? I do. But... Darling, Hugh is gone. And even though it hurts, you simply must move on. - Do you love Bill? - Yes. Then do it, Patricia. The Winterbournes need new blood like us. Promise that you'll never take that baby away again. That's the one I would choose, Patricia. - That's pretty too. - I think they're all stunning. - Up, up. - Rising, each layer. Each layer rising separately. - Is this the main one? - This is. This one has ivy. This is so wonderful. Look at this. - Ascending into the light... - Exactly. - What're you doing after this? - What did you have in mind? May I cut in on this one? - You're a lucky man, Bill. - Thank you. I haven't had the pleasure. You haven't? I have. Steve DeCunzo. You remember. - I'm glad your mother's doing so well. - Thank you, Steve. Very well, then. Just one dance. - I want her all to myself. - You'll have to catch us first. - What are you doing here? - So we have met before! - Just get away from me! - What's wrong? Connie! Is something bothering you, Connie? Connie? - Why are you here? - I thought you were dead! I thought my only child was dead. That does something to a man. I cried. I really did. How are you? I cried for you and for the kid... and for how I'm pissing my life away. I started making changes. You'd be proud. And then, a few weeks later... I steal this radio and find a People magazine. And there's this picture of the Winterbourne family. And wouldn't you know it? Their new daughter-in-law looks just like this tramp I knew. You sent the note! You didn't write, but I didn't see a reason to be insensitive. Okay, it worked. You got me scared. So what's next? You're so nervous. I just wanna congratulate you on this great life you've... appropriated for yourself. The dead chick wasn't gonna use it anymore. And by the way, marrying the guy's brother? You thought of that? That was pure genius. Didn't know you had it in you. Congratulations. - That's it? - Absolutely. There is one thing. My son. What role do I, the father, have in all this? I'll give you a goddamn role! I'd be happy to discuss this with your mother-in-law. - How would her heart take my news? - Okay. What do you want? Come by my place tomorrow and bring my boy. What'd you name him? Hugh. After the dead rich guy, right? - That's very cute. - Come near him and I'll kill you. Be there tomorrow... or I'll mess up your life so bad you'll never see that kid again. Not for nothing, but that is a good look for you. Hold it right there. Thank you. I don't like that guy. Do we know him? No, but you're gonna find out. Watch out for the sharks. - Here you are. - Thanks. Hey, there's the guy! Look at that. Big boy. Look at that. Look at that. That's my chin. That's my chin. Look what I got for you here, pal. Look what I got for you. - What's with him? - He's got taste. Come here. Come here. Come here. So, you got a plan? Let's hear it. I ought to tell them about this nasty con you're pulling on them. It's not right to let the kid live a lie. I should let everybody know who he really is... and sue for custody. Birth fathers are winning cases like this every day. And look at the mother's character. A slut con artist exploiting a family to get money. Mommy would never see you again. But the problem is... I still get nothing and I'm stuck with a baby. It's filled out. Just tell me the amount. Fifty thousand. "Patricia Winterbourne." Very nice. Very nice. Thanks. But... that's not enough. I have a better idea. No, you'll like it. An idea where everyone gets what they want. How many ideas do you come up with? Not many. Wanna hear? - Why are you asking me? - Do you? You take the kid out for a walk, I'll show up and kidnap him. I'll smack you so it looks like you struggled. They'll give at least a million. That way I get a return... for sacrificing my parental rights. You go near that kid and I'll call the cops. I'll say it was your idea. - They won't believe you. - Why else would you pay me $50,000? With a forged check, by the way. - I won't hurt those people. - They won't miss a million. What if I just clear out? - I'll take the kid. - You don't want him. But he's mine. Aren't you, big boy? This will kill Grace It'll kill her. She's gotta die sometime. - I have to go. - I had him laughing. You see that? You and the kid gonna take a walk in the Commons tomorrow? I'm getting married tomorrow. So? Hello, Steve. What you can learn. We've forgotten our dreams. We've forgotten how you can find adventure in... Your partner's here. I got a little change in the plan. Instead of me taking a walk and you stealing him... you get out of my life, or I blow your head off! Will you stop watching the damn TV?! Future will be what we make it. Holy shit! Oh, my God! Jesus Christ! I didn't do it! I just came to scare him! I didn't even know it was loaded! It went off! He was already dead! We could've discussed this problem. Believe me, Bill. He was dead when I got here. - I do. - How'd you know I was here? I got here first, then... followed you. - Why'd you come? - Paco... followed him last night. I came to... To do what?! Oh, Bill, you didn't! No, no, no. Of course I didn't! All right. If neither of us did it... then let's call the police. No, let's just get out of here, okay? - Wait! - What? Come on! Come on! Let's get out of here! Shit! - Come on. - Forget it. - You don't believe I didn't kill him. - Nope. Damn it. We'll never trust each other again. I trust you. You shouldn't. I've lied to you ever since we met. You don't have to tell me. - Yeah, I do. - Honestly, I don't care. You don't even know who the hell I am! I'm not Patricia Winterbourne. I didn't even know your brother. I met him once... with his wife before the crash! The hospital screwed up. I didn't have a place... - Okay, Connie. - How could it be okay? - What? - It's okay... Connie. I knew all that. What? I didn't know all the details, but... You knew? It's okay. - Why didn't you tell me? - What is this? I've been going out of my mind! Now we got a dead guy! And Bill knew all the time! - I didn't think you'd kill him! - I didn't kill him! All right... maybe I should've been more forthcoming. I'm not exactly Miss Honesty in this relationship. I was afraid to tell you. I thought it'd scare you away. I fell in love with you... not with your name. I wanted to tell you so many times. First I was just afraid, but then Grace... If she found out Hughie wasn't her grandson... So I committed this major fraud and... tried to marry you under false pretenses. - How do you feel about that? - All couples have secrets. - So, did you kill Steve? - Nope. If I'd known he was trying to hurt you, I might have. - What are you supposed to call me now? - Anything you like. I like Connie. I like Connie too. Glad to see you. Welcome. Alison, be careful! Welcome. It's a glorious day, isn't it? Hello, Father. Lieutenant Ambrose, Boston P.D. Oh, my! Oh, my! - The ceremony may be delayed slightly. - Something wrong? Your mother seems to be confessing to a murder. She must be crazy. Sit down! Sit down! As you were! False alarm! Save the organ! Soon! I just decided that offing him would be more effective. Are you sure you don't want a lawyer present? You should. Can't you confess and go to jail? Mother, what are you doing? I'm confessing, Bill, to the murder of... - Steven DeCunzo. - Exactly. You can't. She's protecting me. - She has no lawyer. - I told her. - I'm who killed him. - No, I am. He was blackmailing us. - I payed him off. - With this? - Which she signed? - I shot him! - He's lying, I shot him. - No, no! Wait! Wait! - I suppose you shot him too? - Yes, I confess. Those of you who shot him, how many times? - Three times! - ...the magazine! Where did you? - In the chest. - In the motel. - Who wants to take this one? - I do. - How far away were you? - I stood across the room. - And I'd do it again. - No. He was shot in the heart. What are you all talking about? I just came about the check. We got the killer in the car. Jesus. I don't know what's going on... but if I commit a crime, I'll wish I was from this family. - Are you sure? - You want me to be wrong? We got the gun, the fingerprints, even a confession. Although there seems a sale on those today. - Why did he do it? - It's a she. Some lover's thing. He knocked her up, tried to dump her. I wanna see her. How long do we sit here? What're you looking at? - Do I know you? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. The bitch out in the rain with the quarter. Didn't you die? Yeah. Looks good on you. I'm sorry. One of us was bound to whack the bastard. I was the lucky one. You guys gotta learn to wait for lawyers. I wanna hire her a great lawyer. One specializing in "I-did-it-can-you-blame-me" defenses. Did you know her? Yeah, I knew her real well. Can I speak with Patricia alone? It's okay. Who was Steven DeCunzo? The baby's father. I was never married to Hugh. I barely knew him. I wish I had. What? I've been lying to you. I should've told you the minute we met. - But with your heart... - What truth? We didn't have any place to go. I didn't want him to grow up like that. This is the only home I've ever had. I fell in love with you all and didn't wanna leave you. I'm just so sorry he's not really your grandson. He will be. My heart could stand four more of these. Really? Do you, William Hazard Winterbourne... take Patricia to be your wife... to love, honor and cherish for as long as you both shall live? I do. Do you, Patricia, take William to be your husband? To love, honor and cherish as long as you shall live? No. Do you have a ring to... Excuse me? I, Constance Helen Doyle... do all that. Just... do it. Do you have a ring to show as a symbol of your love? I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Mr. Winterbourne. Mrs. Winterbourne. He's married.
