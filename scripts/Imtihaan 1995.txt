But that daughter neither cares for me nor my honour. What has Preeti done now? What do I say? A prospective groomis family had come to see her yesterday. But she went out before they could come. Only I know the embarrassment I suffered near the guests. You know everything, but only donit know .. .. that you have suffered a heart attack once before. Do you know how harmful worrying can be for you? How can I not worry? Can I forget that I am the father of a young girl? You stop worrying, l|'ll make Preeti understand. Where is she by the way? Good evening! My dear friends, I .. Friends, I will throw this flower towards you. In whose lap this flower falls .. .. this evening will be in his honour. It is the first time I have been floored by someoneis beauty. Only you can help me now. Help me, for the sake of your fragrance. The way Arjunis arrow had hit the eye of the fish .. .. you too fall in her lap only. How lucky you are! Friends, todayis evening is in her honour! You are leaving my hand and going. Why did you stop" .. after taking two steps? After taking two steps. I am aware. That you love me. Why did you stop .. .. after meeting my eyes? You are leaving my hand and going. Why did you stop after taking two steps? After taking two steps? Even meeting the eye is an expression. Even lowering the eyes is an expression. This is true, you can ask anyone. That stealing a glance is also an expression. Dont look there, there is nothing there. Here is the heart that loves you. Even your temper is beautiful. I love even that expression of yours. What your have eyes said .. .. come close to me and ask me. Come close and ask me. I have a strange feeling today. Every desire of mine has come to fore. Why do I feel today" .. that the pace of my heart beat has changed? I have a loving temperament. What about yours? I will tell you .. .. the secret that is hidden in my heart. I wish to keep you .. .. hidden in my every breath. You are leaving my hand and going. Why did you stop after taking two steps? - Mr.DD! - Mr.Pande! How are you? - Hello, uncle. - Hello. Who is besides that beautiful girl? That beautiful girls name is Preeti. Besides her is her father, Mr.DD. The one who I wanted you to meet. You wanted it? It is my duty to fulfill your desire. - Lets go and meet him. - Yes, lets go. Mr.DD, meet Vicky. And Vicky, meet Mr.DD. - Mr.DD Khanna! - Pleased to meet you, sir. Pleased to meet you, Vicky. He came to this city a few years ago .. .. and today, the entire citys business is in his hands. - Mr.Pande. - Come here. - I want to introduce him. - Ill do that. - Vicky, she is my daughter" - Preeti! I can never forget her all my life. You mean you know each other? Not she, only I know her. No one has heard my song the way she heard it. It can mean only two things. Either you didn't like the song, or the singer. I think both assumptions are wrong. Because she herself loves music. And even her father loves the singer, then why wont she? - Right, Preeti? - Daddy! That means she likes you. Tell me, what did you like here? I think the entire worlds beauty is present here. - Oh really? - I have plans to sightsee tomorrow. I was wondering if I could get a companion .. .. these valleys would become all the more beautiful. At your age, I used to make companions just like that! If thats the case, even Ill start my journey on that hope. That even Ill get a companion in this beautiful valley. - Return my scarf. - First pinch me. What? I would like to know if this is a dream or a fact. I don't have time for such nonsense. Alright, then lets talk sense. Tell me, are you Mr.DDs daughter or not? What nonsense are you talking! Dont feel offended.l observed that Mr.DD is so lively .. .. but his daughter has no heart at all. Only two assumptions can be made .. .. from your leaving the scarf behind. Either you don't care for things, or you want to gift it to me. I accept the gift. I promise it will be more dear to me than my life. Apart from you, I don't lack anything. But I feel gloomy without you. It was my decency that I kept ignoring your brazenness. I wonder what misconception .. .. made you go beyond limit. I don't think I have done anything unusual .. .. for which you should get so angry. How could you gather courage to send this gift to me! Courage? In love, courage" Mr.Vicky, if you dare to misbehave again .. .. I will probably forget that you are a guest in this city. Vicky, now not two, but only one thing can happen in love. You have failed. Now take the help of God. Thank you. Hello, Ms.Preeti. You cannot call this misbehavior. Even I am entitled to receive Gods food. You and here? It is good to know .. .. that you have faith in prayer and worship. It is the first time I have offered prayers. Lets see when the Goddess will be pleased with me. Come, let us ask the Goddess to fulfill our wishes. Come. Mr.DD, you have everything. What else do you want from God? A young girls fathers only worry is .. That he should get a good son-in-law. Preeti, what kind of a son-in-law does Mr.Khanna want? By the way, what are you doing tonight? - Nothing. - Good. Then come to our house in the evening. Today is Preetis birthday. Oh! Then I will begin waiting for the evening to come. Hey! Atleast seek the blessings of the Goddess. I sought her blessings, and have even been rewarded. And assume that the Goddess has heard your prayer. She will surely send your son-in-law to the party tonight. To recognise him is your job. Only two assumptions can be made about your disinterest. Either you are afraid of society. Or you don't care for my love. Only two assumptions can be made about your disinterest. I have been standing in your path .. .. with my heart held out for you. But you do not believe in my love for you. Only two things can happen now. Either victory or defeat. Tell me to die .. .. or come and hold my hand. Only two assumptions can be made about your disinterest. Preeti, you love returning gifts, don't you? The gift I have brought today, .. .. only two things can happen after this. You will either accept the gift or return it. And in both cases, victory will be mine. - Preeti. - Yes, daddy? If you accept Vicky as your life partner .. .. your life will go smoothly. Daddy, you are well aware I am not destined for that happiness. Dont blame your destiny! You yourself have invited this gloom. Come out of it and see! Happiness is waiting for you. And I will give you that happiness. Daddy, you have tried this several times before. Yes, but those were attempts of a weak father. Today, DD Khanna is telling you his decision. You will have to marry Vicky! What right do you have to make decisions about my life? What right do I have? The one who lives only for you, you ask him what right he has? The one whose honour you never cared for .. .. you ask him what right he has? The one who spent his entire life rearing you .. .. you ask him what right he has? Doctor, hes out of danger now, isnt he? He is out of danger, but it isnt all over yet. Save daddy. Please, uncle! A doctor can only give treatment" .. not fulfill the patients wish. You are aware that your father has only one wish. There are only a few steps between life and death. If you put your acceptance as a hurdle between that space .. .. then maybe your daddy lives a little longer. I beg of you child, don't sacrifice my friends life .. .. on the altar of your obstinacy. I am ready to get married. - Really? - Yes. Child, you will have to make me a promise. Dont tell Vicky anything about your past. - But.. - Dont tell him anything. Ramu Kaka, I have brought good news early in the morning. Congratulations! My friend Vicky has got married. He is bringing his wife here. Just do one thing. Polish up the house. No! Dont beat me! God! I think he has seen a dream again. And what is strange is that his dreams come true. He tries hard to ensure that his dream doesn't come true .. .. but it does. Who can stall what is destined? Nandu, get up. Vicky has got married and is coming here. That means my dream will surely come true. No. I cannot get beaten by a woman. I cannot stay here today. I will have to leave. Let me go! Tell me, do any women work in your hotel? No. And this room you have given me, .. .. there is no picture of a woman in it, is there? No, but why are you asking me this? Because if she comes out of the picture and beats me, what then? I don't understand. Anything can happen to make my dream come true. So please, until evening, no one should come in my room. Specially not a woman. - Alright. - Thank you. No woman should enter room O07. One must bathe with cold water. This door is closed. All doors open here with keys. My keys. - Where is that rascal? - A woman! Which rascal? The one who brought me here, finished his work .. .. locked me up in the bathroom and sent you here. - Where is he? - Look, no one sent me here. I came here on my own. Then you only will have to pay for yourself and that man. The rogue left without paying me! Look madam, you are mistaken, lam not that kind of man. You are not that kind of man? ls that why you were coming towards me with your clothes off? I was going to have a bath. I know very well! Even you are a freeloader like that other man. Give me money! But money for what? I havent even done anything. Then do it, who is stopping you? - I'll get beaten! - I will take money from you! Why will you take money from me? Will you quietly leave on your own or do I call the waiter .. .. and make you suffer humiliation? What, you will make me suffer humiliation?lll humiliate you! -You rascal! You rogue! -Who can stop what is destined! On their first night, .. .. no one apart from the wife and husband enter the room. Then how come this sleep entered our room? I had put you here to decorate the room. But you put my Preeti to sleep with your fragrance. Only two things happen on the first night. Either the groom goes to the bride or the bride goes to him. The groom has failed, now you only will have to come to me. I will wait for you outside. Oh! So this is what you do secretly nowadays. Look, return those photos to me! Or youve had it from me! Dont be so cruel! You couldnt belong to me because of Raja. Atleast let these photos remain with me. Alright. Now only Raja will take these photos from you. Raja? Preeti, Raja always comes between us. If Raja hadnt been my friend, .. .. I wonder what Id have done to him. What would you do? If I wouldnt get your love, Id take you by force. If you have the guts, try it. Guts? Actually, if Id not had to go to London,ld prove it to you. - Oh yeah? - Yeah! Tell Raja I will meet him tomorrow. Your youth has blossomed. I, Gulshan, should be the first one to smell it. How do you like the smell of this? A lion only wants a prey. You saved her from me. Now who will save you? You hit me? Do you know what fate you will meet now? -Come. -You are always picking fights. Why did you have to do this? It is because of this nature that papa doesn't like you. Whether he likes me or not, what difference does it make? You like me. If you don't change your habits, .. .. its possible even I stay away from you. Will you be able to stay away from me? You will change only if I stay away from you. Why did you come here? You want me to be dismissed from college? You are aware that I am the ex-student of this college. More than you, I have a right on this college. You had a right over it, not any more. Preeti, the class is empty. Why don't we take advantage of this opportunity? Preeti, why do you always misunderstand? Come, Ill teach you music. You will teach me music? This is not a knife, a sword, a baton, that you will teach me. Understand! I will leave such a lasting impression of my love on you. I will leave my image in your eyes. Preeti, I don't feel like leaving you. That is why I am telling you to marry me soon. Then come, let us have a rehearsal. - You know me, don't you? - Yes. People like you first get to know rich people .. .. and then get friendly with their daughters. Before making friends with Preeti, .. ...you should have at least considered your status. Mr.Khanna, the sun rays give equal light to you and me. It doesn't differentiate between our status. Preeti can get influenced by such tall talks .. .. but not me. I want to ask you that the fake love youve trapped Preeti in.. ..will you release her from it, or will I have to do something? Mr.Khanna, is this a request or a threat? I don't make requests to lowly people like you. If you think that you, with all your money power, .. .. can stop our love, then try it. Get this clear! If you don't stop meeting Preeti .. .. I can even speak to you in the language you understand. Where are you going? I will ruin and disgrace you today! So that your lover goes crazy on seeing you in that state. IQ! Seeing your condition Raja will understand .. .. that my revenge for that slap has been taken. If next time he tries to mess with me, .. .. I will actually rape you. Who did this to you, Preeti? Te me, Free. Tell me. I put you on oath. - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. Count! Count the number of wounds on my sons body! I want Raja in that many pieces! Did you see the outcome of being friends with Raja? If you were not friends with Raja, .. .. Gulshan would never have taken his revenge from you. You are probably not aware .. ..but I am the cause of enmity between Raja and Gulshan. You are mistaken. Raja is a man who makes enemies with everyone. What I fail to understand is what you see in that ruffian. Daddy, Raja is hot-tempered, but he is not a ruffian. That is what you think. Daddy, just see Raja once the way I see him. Even you will begin to like him then. Enough, Preeti! You have praised that loafer enough. You take my love for you to be my weakness .. .. that is why you havent stopped meeting Raja .. .. despite my several warnings. And I probably never will stop meeting him. Let me see how you meet that goon from now on! Why have you come here? You know very well why I have come here. I will not let you meet Preeti! Before I forget that you are Preetis father, .. -- get out of my way! You are a goon, so you are bound to use threatening language. Henceforth, Ill not allow even your shadow to fall on Preeti! Please move out of my way. I will not move from here! - Move! - I will not let you meet Preeti! - Move! - I will not! Lets go. Preeti, until today, society treated you with respect .. "because you were my, Deen Dayal Khannas daughter. Tomorrow, the same society will avoid you. Until you live in this house, .. .. you are the daughter of a respectable family. The moment you step out, .. .. you will be called a girl who eloped with a goon. You will live, but life will seem a burden to you. Maybe your father is right, Preeti. Will you be able to meet the accusing eyes of society? Will you be able to say with pride that you love this goon? Will you be able to give all this up & live happily with me? Answer me, Preeti! If Preeti had favoured you, she wouldve.. .. turned towards the door. If you still have any decency left in you .. ...don't try to meet Preeti ever again. Raja, wait! I have brought an answer to all your questions. Take this. Daddy, I did all this to save your honour. Or my love is not dependent on marriage. Mr.Khanna, finally, love has won. You could not stop this flow of emotion. Lets go. Slop! Preeti, stop! Look! Even God wants your daughter to marry me. I will kill you! Daddy, if you have the guts to widow your own daughter, .. .. go ahead, shoot! You can call this stupid act marriage, not me! A father can understand our emotion, not a stone. Lets go. Raja, stop! Raja, I say stop! You are now man and wife. See what a good friend I am. Youre going to London tomorrow, so I got married today. I even saved you from giving me a gift. You got married to suit yourself. And where the gift is concerned, I actually forgot.. I didn't forget. How can I forget? These are the keys to my bungalow in Khandala. Go and celebrate your honeymoon there. Tell me what happened after nine months. Preeti is embarrassed. Call me after you reach there. Come. My heart says let us make love .. .. slowly, stealthily, secretly. Who knows when we will get such romantic weather again. My heart says that let us make love .. .. slowly, stealthily, secretly. Who knows when we will get such romantic weather again. Your every move is intoxicating. It makes me more desperate. I crave for you .. .. now that you are close to me. This is a union of two hearts. That is what this beautiful night says. Now that you have touched me .. .. my youth has blossomed. Let me place my lips on yours. That is what even I want. That is what even I dream of. Who knows when we will get such romantic weather again. No. Get up! People are afraid of KK & his son like one is afraid of devils. Yet you dared to cross swords with us? I will take your life today! NO!! Preeti! What happened, Preeti? Preeti, open your eyes. I saw a wonderful dream! I will get married. Marriages nowadays are so strange. The wife sleeps in the room, and the husband sleeps outside. It will be better if you don't get married. But how come you thought of marriage today? Did you see a dream again today? What I saw today was wonderful! Neither will I get beaten by a woman, nor a man. And I myself keep away from kids. I will propose every girl. Someone is bound to accept. I will evade what is destined today. Beautiful girl! - Listen! - What is it? I have decided to make you my wife. Shut-up! Dont you feel ashamed? But you didn't beat me? I don't feel ashamed. I do feel embarrassed, but I must say this today. I want to make you my wife. Are you mad to tease a girl? - How dare you tease a girl! - I will! I cannot get beaten today! Who are you? What is the matter? - You dare to tease a girl? - I didn't. Go ahead, tease. Its good. I didn't get beaten. Ive met my dream girl! Make me your husband. Neither can a woman beat me, nor a man. And I drove the kid away. - Who can beat me now? - I can! No! - Where are you going? Everybody come here! Look, he is teasing me. - Beat him. - Yes, beat me! Who can stop what is destined! You got beaten! But I don't understand. What was the reason of sleeping separately yesterday? The question you are putting me, .. .. Ive put the same question to myself .. .. several times since last night. But I havent found any answer. But what happened after all? When I entered the room, Preeti was fast asleep. I found that strange. But I left the room assuming that she must be tired. After some time, I heard her scream and ran to the room. She looked very scared and was standing near the window. This is like making a mountain of a mole hill. What do you mean? This is normal human nature. It takes time to get used to a new place. Take my advise. Give Preeti so much love .. .. that she forgets her past. Even if she falls asleep, it is in your arms. Preeti, you saw the bloomed flowers in the garden. But my flower hasnt bloomed yet. I wonder when it will bloom. The road ahead is bad, and the weather has also turned bad. It is dangerous to go up in such a situation. Please return home. Come next full moon night. Hail the Goddess! The Goddess fulfills ones wish on the full moon night. Preeti, take the car and go home. - Let me test God today. - But .. No Preeti, only two things can happen today. Either I will return dejected, or God will grant me my wish. Priest, it is possible that God wants to test us. But.. Whether anyone else goes or not, I surely will. Son, this is not worship, its suicide. My soul already belongs to someone. What is left is this body. Let me surrender it to God. What a crazy man. He didnt listen, despite my warnings. Listen! Child, who are you waiting for in this stormy weather? The one you called crazy. I tried my best not to fall in love with you. But love cannot be controlled. Its my heart after all, it fell in love with you. My heart is not at fault. Your name is on my lips. My heart holds your image. lam fortunate .. .. that you accepted my love. I am fortunate. Our hearts say .. .. well never part now. I tried my best not to fall in love with you. But love cannot be controlled. Its my heart after all, it fell in love with you. My heart is not at fault. I wonder how those people survive .. ...who don't have anyone they love. They must be stone hearted, .. ...those who don't love anybody. How would I have not given my consent. I am not so arrogant. I tried my best not to fall in love with you. But love cannot be controlled. Its my heart after all, it fell in love with you. My heart is not at fault. - Enough, Preeti. - One more. If you keep feeding me like this, .. ...I'll be ruined for home and career. I want to feed you and make you so fat .. .. that you cannot move out of this chair. That way, at least you will stay with me. Why make me fat for that? I myself am ready to spend my life in your arms. lam sure this is some enemy of love calling. I told you it must be Sunils call! Yes, I remember. I have told Preeti that were lunching with you today. But when.. Yes..Yes, alright..Okay. - When did you tell me? - Sorry, I forgot. But you get ready and come to the rehearsal hall. - Well lunch with Sunil today. - Okay. - Be on time. - Yes. - Wh..whats on your cheek? - Where? Here. The idiot Sunil! He always say I am late. And he himself hasnt turned up today. Sh..Shekhar?..Here? I have come here from London for a few days. I had never expected that you will..meet me like this. You two know each other? We've spent many years together. We were in the same college. Shekhar, meet my husband Vicky. You two friends talk while I go and call my friend .. .. and check why he hasnt come yet. Preeti, you got married? - Yes. - Does he know about you and Raja? No, he doesn't know anything about my past. - What if he comes to know? - Shekhar, Vickys coming. Preeti, I am staying in this hotel. I have some pictures of you and Raja. Come and collect them if you want to. What is the matter? You are leaving when I have come. I was looking for a friend. Maybe he is at the pool side. - I'll go and check. - Have lunch with us. I'll keep meeting you now. Well speak some other time. Sunil was stuck with some case. He has left home now. His punishment is that we go to another hotel now. Yes, lets leave this place. - What happened? - Nothing. What is Preeti doing with this guy? She? She is his wife. Preeti is back in this city. She will surely meet me now! I got late because my car broke down. I thought you must be sleeping, .. .. so I came in stealthily so as not to wake you up. How was I know to know youll get scared. - Dont ever do this again. - Alright. Just a minute. Yes, I am her husband speaking. When did this happen? Alright, Ill bring Preeti along and come. Preeti, you daddy has taken ill suddenly. Well have to go. - How are you? - In": fine, daddy. - Vicky didn't come? - Hes coming with the luggage. I want to speak to Preeti in private. Alright. What is the matter, daddy? lam carrying a burden on my heart. I cannot carry that burden any longer. When destiny snatched Raja from you .. .. and you came back, you were always lost in your past. I had to go for some important work to Ooty. You suddenly fell ill. I took you also to Ooty along with me. There, I came to know that you were carrying Rajas baby. You were blessed with a daughter. But your selfish father lied to you .. .. that the baby was still-born. No..no..no. That days lie is still piercing my heart. Your baby is alive. Her name is Pinky. She is in lshwarchand orphanage in Bombay. Hurry up. Hurry! - Hello. - Hello. I am pleased to see that you are rearing" .. these kids like a mother. Msayatri, if it wasnt for your love, .. .. these poor kids would have suffered. Mnlshwarchand, the truth is, what you do for these kids .. .. even their parents wouldnt have been able to do. I see my childhood in them. If me, who is an orphan, hadnt got someones support .. .. I wouldnt become the rich man I am today. Youve come again? lshwarchand, when I like something, .. .. I see to it that I get it. I have told you several times before .. .. that I will not give you this land. Those who are beggars are given something. We want to buy your land. I will not sell this land at any cost. I grab what is not sold to me. No son, he is a respectable man. We should give him a last chance to think over. Remember, if we cannot get things by fair means .. .. we even use foul means. I am pleased to know that after Mr.Khanna .. .. you have taken over the responsibility of Pinky. - Can I meet Pinky? - Why not? You have a greater right on her than us. - Call Pinky from room 4. - Yes, madam. You stay here, Pinky will join you. Alright. - You've come to meet me? - Yes, child. - Why? - I will play with you. - I'll take you out. - Do that later. - First do one thing for me. - Tell me. Sit down. Write. Mother. - Say it again. - Mother. - Say it again. - Mother. Please write. Yes, child. I am very annoyed with you. Why don't you come to meet me? Pinky, youve come. She must have asked even you to write a letter to her mother. If you don't have any objection, .. .. can I take Pinky with me for 2-4 days? Only if you want to adopt her. - That is what I want. - Then I have no objection. What is the matter, Pinky? Everyone says that my mother has gone across the ocean. I'll just be back after giving her this letter. Pinky..Pinky! Listen to me. - Let me go. - lll unite you with your mother. - Really aunty?! - Yes. Aunty, what is a mother like? Ramu Kaka, see who is at the door! Yes child, Ill check it out. Now its your turn to catch me. - Come in sir. - How are you, Ramu kaka? In": fine. Yes. Dont cheat. I know you can see everything. - You are here. - Yes, I am. How did this new guest come into our house? Id gone to the orphanage. I liked her so I got her here. - Caught you! - What is your name? - My name is Pinky. - Pinky?! Nice name. Did your aunty feed you anything or.. "she kept playing with you through out the day? - She gave me lot to eat. - Your aunt is really nice then. Yes. Aunty will reunite me with my mother. Very good. You had lot to eat with your aunty. Now you have to eat with me too. Okay? - Yes. - Ramu kaka, serve the dinner fast. - Yes What happened? Drink water. Enough? Are you okay? How are you feeling? My child. Will you have more? Have a little more. Please. You are auntys darling, arent you? Lovely child! One more. Last bite. - Now one last bite. - Thats it. 0K5! ' - Aunty? - Go to sleep, my child - Preeti? - Yes? - Has she slept? I have also some claim over you. Ive been noticing that youre giving Pinky lot of importance. Why are you saying that? Because she might not be able to bear being separated" ..from you, when you drop her back tomorrow. Vicky..what if we adopt this child? I have no problems in keeping her with us. But when we have our own children then we might not" ..be able to give her the same affection as we do today. Then..think about what she will go through. It will be better if you drop her back at orphanage. Hey! Your silence proves, not two but one thing. That I have to get ready very soon to become a father. When you have decided to send her back then.. ...it will be better if you don't meet her often. If she becomes attached to you then" ..it will be difficult for us to manage her. Please. You are also leaving me and going like my mother did. You had lied to me about reuniting me with my mother. I'll never come to know what a mother is like. I'll never talk to you. Brother, how much for one plate masala dosa and batata vada. - 13 rupees. - 13 rupees? Here is it. Take it. Why don't you eat first? I'll take the money later. No. I'll not let my dreams be fulfilled today. - Dreams? - Yes. Youll not understand. My pocket will be picked and I shall be beaten. Take your money. Even if my pocket is picked, Ill not beaten. Masala dosa. - Here is the masala dosa. - Yes. - Sorry. I slipped. - Are you drunk? Crazy fellow! - The bill. - No. Ive already paid at the counter. - Before eating? - Yes..before eating. I have been working as a waiter for last 2O years. Youre the first customer who has paid before eating. You don't believe me, don't you? I have paid the bill. - You can ask him. - Lets go. - Lets go. - Come on. - How can you speak like that? Where is that man who was standing here a while back? His duty has got over? What work do you have? He says that he paid the bill before eating here. - I have paid the money. - Where have you paid? Its a good excuse to have paid when youve seen Sharma leave. Oh no..l have paid the money. 13 rupees for masala dosa and batata vada. - You are lying. - Whom did you pay the money? If you don't believe me, Ill pay again but Ill not be beaten. My wallet! Somebody stole my wallet. - See! - Ill be clobbered. Where will you beat me? - Here itself! - Beat him. - Hit him. - Hit him. Hello sister-in-law. In": Sunil speaking. I hope you remember that its my marriage anniversary today. Yes. I have already spoken to Vicky. He will come to the party straight from the rehearsal. - Please can you make it on time? - Yes. - Yes. I'll surely come. - Thank you. 'I will leave such a lasting impression of my love on you. 'I will leave such a lasting impression of my love on you. 'I will leave my image in your eyes.

'But cannot live without telling you howl feel. 'How will I ever be at peace with this passion? 'We will not be apart even in death. 'I will leave my image in your eyes.

I was taken aback on hearing the song, about where he got this" ..wonderful love song from. Nowl know that it is sister-in-laws choice. 'I will leave such an impression of my love. What attitude! How many more secrets do you have? - Hello. Hello? - Who was it? But.. - Preeti. - Yes? Youll surely come to the rehearsal on missing me. It will be better if you come along with me. No. I don't feel like going out today. Okay. I'll leave. - Everyone will be waiting. - Okay. - Take care. - Hello. - Ramu Kaka, give the phone to Preeti. - She is not at home. - Shell be coming to meet me. Preeti! Where are you lost?

You will stay here till I take Preetis testimony. But Inspector, Preeti is still unconscious. I see. You want to flee before she gains consciousness. What do you want to say, Inspector? Mr. Vicky, In": investigating this case. Even after giving it a lot of thought, I could not" "understand why you came home when your show was not over yet. Did you know before hand that Preeti was going to be attacked? Are you suggesting that I tried to kill Preeti? - It can be. - You are crazy! If I had done it, then why would I bring her to the hospitall? Only Preeti can tell us the reason why! Till she gains consciousness, youll stay here with me. Come on. You bastard! You tried to murder my wife. Vicky..lm not the one whom you are mistaking me for. In": Preetis first husband. Then why did you try to kill her. I did not try to kill her. The misunderstanding will be cleared if you listen to me. I was married to Preeti for one night only. I was dead for her the next day. The fishermen saved me and I took a long time to get well. When I came back to the city, her father had gone somewhere. I saw his picture in the paper one day and went to meet him. I was very happy when I saw Preeti but.. ..l was surprised to see vermilion on her forehead. That lie has been haunting me since then. Peerti..your daughter is still alive. Her name is Pinky. She is at the lshwarchand orphanage in Mumbai. I decided at that moment that I will not come" .. in between you two. That I will take my child far away from here. That is why I went to the orphanage to take her. There I saw Preeti taking Pinky out, somewhere. Why do you want to adopt Pinky? Pinky will get a father and Ill get a reason to live for. Preeti is Pinkys caretaker. Youll have to meet her. - ls it necessary? - Yes. Her permission is necessary in order to adopt Pinky. I was not able to understand how to get back my daughter.

You want your daughter from Preeti? You can yourself get her. You will not understand. Call her. Hello. - Her husband is at home. - Try once more. - Hello. - This is Shekhar. Its important that I meet you. In": waiting for you at the hotel Skylarks gift shop. Okay? I know that you don't want to reveal the past to your husband. That is why you have kept your child in the orphanage. I want to adopt your child. You know, In": helpless due to the situation. I cannot hand over my child to anyone. - Preeti, lll..- No, don't ever try to meet me again. Preeti is a mother. And a mother will not give away her child to a stranger. Preeti..lm Raja speaking. The situation has forced me to call you when I didnt want to. It is very important that I meet you. In": staying at hotel Skylark, room number 316. Dont cry. Your tears cannot change our fate. After being separated from you.. ..l went the way my destiny guided me. Raja..l married" I know, in what circumstances and how you got married. I don't have any complaints. In": happy for you".
