It was beautiful. Stop! Peter. Peter Porter, come here please. Good work on the fire, bud. Look at this. This is a very beautiful spot. What about this full moon? You could get a moon tan. So tell us about the meteor shower. And do you know what a meteor shower is? It's the ice and debris that's... Well, actually, the sun is melting the ice off the comet and that's when the debris falls loose. - Do you believe him? - No. I don't believe you either. Check out our campsite. Are you guys hungry? Yeah, what'd you bring to eat? - Hot dogs? - "Sot" dogs. This is the Porter family. Can you turn the little... Look at that! ...yard this big and our dog will always be happy. - Wow. Okay. Oh! - Hello. Oscar. - Oscar! - Oscar! What is he doing? - Oscar! - Shit! Excuse me? Crap. Don't repeat that. Oscar! Oscar! Oscar! Do you see him? Is everything okay? Baby? Okay, do you remember anything else? I just remember screaming. Mom! He was eating my boy alive. Very, very sketchy details here. An American man and his young son holidaying in France were brutally killed last night... The circumstances are very graphic. ...what police believe was a vicious animal attack. In what authorities believe was a brutal animal attack... ...an attack that has shocked police officers. Authorities have confirmed the death of 36-year-old Henry Porter And Peter Porter. ...found mutilated. He was just seven years old. The young mother is the only survivor. Claire Porter... ...taken by ambulance. Authorities are hopeful she will recover... I have lived here, my whole life. Cannot remember anything like this ever. People are wondering what type of animal... A breed of animal has yet to be determined. Police are urging people to be patient as they continue with their investigation. He was tall and thin. It had hair all over. His hands, they were huge. You said "he." A major turn in this tragic case. This is now officially a murder investigation. Now, suggesting that there may be someone... ...responsible for the death of the Porter family. This is not an animal attack. Not an animal attack. What type of man could be capable of such things? The question many in France are asking... One of the biggest manhunts in recent times. An entire community living in fear. A very peaceful place and what has happened has shattered that peace. Major developments in the huge manhunt. A local man was taken into custody. At 14:52, we apprehended the suspect at his residence. Police have identified a man... ...involved in the Porter tragedy. - The suspect's name is Talan Gwynek. - ...Talan Gwynek. - The only suspect... - ...accused of murder. This monster of a man... ...refusing to answer police questions. We also learned that Gwynek's home in Cerdon... ...is only two miles from the location of the attack. Gwynek has been transferred from Cerdon to Lyon. But the question, the validity of the charges. No clear motive. No prior criminal records. Some legal analysts are calling his arrest an abuse of human rights. Well, at this stage there is no factual evidence to indicate anything more than an animal attack. Katherine Moore... Gwynek's court-appointed attorney... There is a vague description by a woman who was very much in shock. Europe has a long and sordid history of animalistic murderers. To be honest, I'm not convinced this is an act of murder at all. The French legal system values hard evidence more than eye witness testimony. That nuance is certainly relevant to this case and I believe it will work in our favor. You're an American living in France, an expatriate. Well, um, both my parents were human rights lawyers. My father was French, my mother an American. When they divorced I spent every summer in France with my father. Mrs. Moore, were you hesitant to accept this case, considering the victims are American and the defendant is French? What matters to me would be to see an innocent man sent to prison. Okay. I think we got it. Great. Hey. Hey. You look great. Yeah, you too. How are you? I'm good, good. Mmm. Oh... Uh, how was your flight? It was fine. So, uh... Good. So you're doing TV interviews now. Yeah, I'm not used to that, that's for sure. Did I look as nervous as I felt? No, you looked like you'd been doing it for years. Good. Um... Oh, here, let's just move out here. Um... Been a while. So... Damn, I didn't want this to be awkward. Mmm... Oh, hey. Problem. Mmm. Monsieur? Oh, shoot, uh, Eric, this is Dr. Gavin Flemyng. Kate, come on. It's Gavin. Gavin. Oh, okay. He doesn't speak French. - Very well. The Gavin, right? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I heard a lot about you. Come on in. Thanks for helping out. Ah, of course. Um... Didn't realize you were American as well. - Do you have a PhD in wildlife forensics? - Yeah. Probably just set up right here. Kate said you did an amazing job on a similar case where you helped redirect the investigation from murder to animal attack? Oh, no, he more than helped. His testimony was instrumental. Oh, I hope you can do the same for us. Here's the initial stuff. Oh. I just wanted to thank you for your time. Uh, if you need anything, like bios, statistics, police reports, hash... Anything. Anything. Anything. Um, actually, I've already put a request to examine the victims' bodies as soon as possible. Maybe you can make, uh, a request to the judge so we can get a quick response? I'll lean on him. Okay, so, uh, back to the Claire Porter interview. The investigative judge agreed to let you review the tape, so we're good on that. He's also okayed you sit down with Talan. All right, and who's investigating? Uh, yes, Captain Klaus Pistor. Ex-military pilot. Been heading up murder investigations for nearly a decade. Every Thursday he eats lunch at Pierre's, orders the Croque-Monsieur with Bleu d'Auvergne cheese. Hates raisins, like crazy. I think there's an allergy issue there. So if you want to kill him that's the way to do it. Hang on a second. Is there a... Yeah. It's good to see you again, Kate. Mmm. Give it time. You just got here. I just remember screaming. He was tall and thin. It had hair all over. His hands, they were huge. You said "he." He was eating my boy alive. Voila. I'm sorry, uh, you don't speak French. Of course, you're English. But you see there was a camera malfunction and, uh, Claire Porter's condition was so poor that the judge concluded the interview. So, you took Talan Gwynek into custody based on her description? Yes, I did. He more than fit the description, don't you think? I am aware his appearance is unique, but did you pursue other leads? Uh, yes, apart from surveying the crime scene, the entry points and the attacker's footprints. Uh, footprints? We didn't, um... We didn't see that evidence in the investigation dossier. Were they photographed or cast? No, the heavy rain had washed them away, but the measurements matched the suspect's. Okay. Um... I do find it a bit unusual that you took my client into custody based on an inconclusive eyewitness account and not hard evidence. Uh, we have the camera malfunction, the footprints being washed away... This investigation's had some issues, Commissaire. You agree? The test results for your client's DNA at the crime scene will be back in less than 48 hours. So, I suggest we continue this conversation then. That is if Gwynek's DNA doesn't show up at the crime scene. Very good. So why don't we go see your, uh, client? Thank you. Follow me. Your team will stay in the observation room. You all right? Mmm-hmm. Very important. You do not touch him. You do not hand him anything unless I say it's okay. But your guards will not be allowed to be in here. It's my client's right. I guess it is. Okay, you have, uh, only five minutes for the initial meeting. Five minutes? Yes, believe me, it will be long enough. He hasn't spoken a word since we arrested him. You can angle these cameras? Take it off, now! Okay. Okay, he's all yours. Good luck. Bonjour, Talan. Talan... Pistor. Uh, I would like to remove his handcuffs. Oh, no, no, no. I take full responsibility for my security. Absolutely, not. No, categorically not. His feet are chained to the floor. And you have guards right outside this door. Don't let me regret this, Ms. Moore. Okay, Rineaux. What's she doing? Thank you. You speak English? Did your mother teach you how to speak English? Yes? My mother, how is she? She's very worried about you. And your father, I have yet to speak with him. My father... He... Your father? Listen, everything is going to be okay. We will talk again soon. Until then, do not speak to anyone else about this case but me. Help me. Everything happened so fast. I got in there, scratched my arm. My glasses went flying. - Are you okay? - Jesus Christ. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. The whole thing just happened so quickly. You all right? Yeah. You didn't get hurt, right? Yeah, thanks for that back there. I'm just your regular knight in shining armor. Did you hear what he said to me? He said, "Help me." That's what he said? Yes. Wow. You sure this is the right case for you? Yeah, more than ever. This doesn't make any sense. You could have been really hurt back there, you know? The guy can barely move. There's no way he could have committed these crimes. If his mobility is as limited as it seems, and, you know, with those attacks, then there's no way he could have done it, you know? There's no way. Wait. Do you know where you're going? God sakes, Katherine. Yes, I know where I'm going. I'm going to look it up on my GPS, because I know your whole, uh, brain GPS is... You're like an old married couple, you two. What? - Bloody hell! - Jeez. Nice driving skills, Eric, really. - Thanks, I got the instinct. You all right? - I'm good. All right. Shall we? Mrs. Gwynek, can you tell us what you remember about the night the Porters died? He was home that night. He was very sick. He did not leave. He couldn't. Sick, how? Talan's condition... He can't move. Can't even get out of bed for days sometimes. - What was he like as a child? - Mmm... He was a happy boy, a kind boy. Children made fun of him, called him names. He didn't ever want to leave the farm, so we choose to school him at home. I take it you taught Talan English as well? Yeah, but he speaks much better than me. He's very smart. Mrs. Gwynek, your accent is Eastern European. It's Moldavian? Uh, Romanian. I was born there, but we moved to France when I was young. We had family all over Europe. Not so much anymore, but we still remember. Do you see me? And this is your mother? Oh, Mama. She's beautiful. And what about this gentleman here? Oh, was my uncle, Tavis. He had the same condition as Talan, only he died before it became too severe, in the war. Uh, what can you tell us about this condition? Well, it's sometimes passed down to the men in our family. Their bones too long and too weak for their bodies. - Has there been any official diagnosis too? - No. No, no one's ever been able to help. We tried, but... I'm sure you did all you could. Yeah. What was it like for Talan growing up? He spent the most time with his father. He died last year. I'm so sorry to hear that. Mrs. Gwynek, um, if you don't mind, would you speak about what happened there? It was a car accident. Uh, he was just driving home late, lost control... Mmm. That must have been very hard on you. It was hardest on Talan. Mrs. Gwynek, I'm having a really hard time understanding why they've decided to target Talan. Do you know why they are convinced that he's guilty? Our land. Your land? Mmm. They've always wanted this land. If I give up my land, will they give me back my boy? Holy shit! Hang on. What is it? You okay? What is it? No! "Killer." It says "Killer." No! No, he's not killer! Please, please, people need to know that! No! He's no monster! People need to know that, please! - We're gonna help him. - We're gonna help him. So, the government wanted to turn the Gwynek's land into a storage site for nuclear waste, which would have given the town a sizeable contract, but the Gwyneks refused. What's so special about their land? The clay down there is extremely dense, which makes it safe for storage. For nuclear waste? Yeah. I mean, nuclear energy powers about 80% of France, so their land is unique. Valuable, I bet. How much was the contract? Um, about 30 million euros. It also says here that Klaus Pistor is on a committee trying to win that contract. You think he had anything to gain? That's a lot of money. Especially down there. You thinking about his father's death? Yeah, I am. Yeah, me too. I just remember... Kate! Eric! ...screaming. I just, uh... I was speaking to a doctor friend of mine from Oxford and, um... Excuse me. Excuse me. Um, we were discussing Talan's appearance and symptoms, and there's a very rare disease called porphyria. Um, symptoms include, um, excessive facial and body hair and receding gums which obviously makes the teeth look longer. And yeah, it also causes crippling chronic joint pain, muscle weakness, all sorts of nerve damage, even seizures. So, people with this can barely move? Exactly and it's so rare that some doctors haven't even heard of it. Okay, great. Uh... What's up? Uh, my necklace, it's gone. Oh, I haven't seen it. Sure it's around. Uh, anyway, um, this condition, how do we test for it? It's actually pretty complicated. It needs a pretty specialized facility in order to handle the tests. There's only one hospital around here that can handle it. How does one... Is it genetic? How does one catch it? I'm not too sure, you're gonna... But, uh, it's certainly a good start. Okay, perfect. We'll request an evaluation for Talan tomorrow first thing. Good. Good. Good. Um... I'm gonna go home. Okay. Kate, do you want... Do you want to just go grab a drink, catch up for a second? Um... I'm beat. It's just... It's been a hell of a day, so... - Okay. - Okay. All right. Um, all right. Good night. Good night. What the hell are you doing, man? What's that? What are you doing? Here with her? What's going on? Um, look, Eric. I don't know you, and you don't know anything about my relationship with Kate. Actually, I know a lot about your relationship with Kate. I don't give a shit about your personal life, man. I really don't. I just hope you're not trying to win her back here. We don't need that kind of distraction. Right, well, first off, it's been five years. Mmm-hmm. Besides, I'm in a relationship so you can rest easy. No, you're not. Yes, I am. No, you're not. You looking into my private life? I'm just doing my job, man. You mind your own business, mate. How do I know I can trust a man who steals information for a living? Mmm. And actually, that reminds me, why is it exactly that you don't work in the States, Eric? You should go home. Oscar! Oh, by the way, we received the DNA results, but, uh, unfortunately, they were contaminated. We're relying on those results. Of course, we all were. Right. Are you familiar with the offer made on the Gwynek land for federal storage and nuclear waste? Of course. Of course, in fact, I talked to the judge already and he said it was irrelevant. The land dispute complicates the investigation, and personally I agree with him. Uh-huh. Oh, I'm still adding it to the dossier. Well, you know, that is your right, I know. But remember this is a murder case, not a land dispute. Okay? Okay, the offer made on the land would have brought 30 million euros to this community. That type of motive... The motive? Ms. Moore, come on. Let's remember who's on trial here. No one is on trial yet, Commissaire. Wow, he didn't want to touch that, did he? No, he didn't. Can you get me the police report on... Talan's father's death. Got it. Thank you. Let's go. Well, I hope you have strong stomachs. Oh, God. You don't have to be here for this. Oh, no problem. You all right? I'm fine. Want a glass of water? No, thank you. Okay. I'll try and do this as quick as possible. Okay... Bodies have been preserved in a negative temperature chamber, so there's minimal to no decomposition. Very vicious clawed attack. Um, the back of the skull has been completely ripped away. There's also a discernible bite pattern, consistent in a large animal attack. The left femur being completely exposed. Bottom jaw's been completely ripped away. Also the tongue been partially consumed. Moving down here to the femur, there's evidence of severe mauling. Once again, no evidence of any type of weaponry and the same bite pattern. An animal did this. Fucking hell! Oh! You okay? Fucking hell. Let's take a look at the boy. Right. No. Okay. So I had hoped to bring you some good news about the DNA, but the samples were cross-contaminated. It's nothing to worry about. It was just a mistake at the lab. It happens all the time. And they're running the new tests now. But I do have some good news for you. We may know the condition you suffer from. It's called porphyria. Did any doctors ever mention this to you or your family before? No? The symptoms of this disease and what you suffer from are very similar. And if you do test positive, it will help prove that you were not physically able to commit these crimes. Uh, we'll have to move you to a hospital for some tests. Is that something you'd feel comfortable with? Yeah? Okay. I would like to talk about the night of the deaths. Do you remember where you were that night? I cannot remember things when I am sick. Okay, I understand. We call those blackouts. Uh... I thought I lost that. It was bent, but I straightened it. Thank you, Talan. It was my father's ring. I lost my father not long ago also. I know how that feels. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Is that Talan's arrest video? He didn't even put up a fight. His father's accident report. Oh, good. Pistor investigated this case and Rineaux was first on the scene. Really? Mmm-hmm. Single car collision, no foul play, ruled an accident. Yeah, but check out the toxicology report. He had Phenobarbital in his system. He had 15 times any normal prescribed amount. Fifteen? I talked to Mrs. Gwynek. So she swore that her husband has no history of drug problems. No depression problems, no medical problems at all. Okay, guys, do you want to come in here a minute? I've just sorted through my findings for the, uh, Henry Porter examination. Yeah, uh, so why didn't Pistor investigate his death as a possible homicide? Money makes people do strange things. It certainly does. Right, so, um, Henry Porter... For the bite marks, first of all, indiscernible. I can't tell you what animal they're from. Um, also, Henry Porter's skull was crushed and it takes 1400 PSI to crush a human skull. And obviously a human's bite is maximum 200 pounds. Good, so not human. No, no... Um, so... Sorry, excuse me a second. What's up with him? I don't know. Fuck. He's a prick is what's up with him. Okay. I mean, he's an animal expert. There are thousands of them. Why him specifically? 'Cause he's best for the case, Eric. Is that right? Yeah. He can't even tell us what animal that is. Let me ask you something. You tell him what happened to me in the States? What happened? No! Why, did he say something? It wasn't her, mate. It was me, I found out myself. It wasn't difficult. You sold privileged attorney-client information for cash. Solid work. Cash? You don't know what you're talking about, all right? So, please, shut the fuck up. Eric. What's going on? Did you get sick or what? Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think it's just the food here. Yeah, France is really known for shit food. Eric. Oui. I'm sorry. Yeah. So, right, anyway, um... Where was I? Uh, the bites. So, it's definitely not human, then? Oh, yes. So, no, no. Uh, no, this was a huge animal. Good. Oh, my God. The hospital... Claire Porter went into septic shock and died. Oh, Jesus. Okay. So the judge authorized your request for a medical evaluation. It seems that you made an interesting point concerning your client's physical deficiencies. Uh, thank you, Ms. Moore. We'll keep you informed. Uh, actually, Commissaire, if I may. Uh, I was going over the police report issued for Jorge Gwynek's car accident. You investigated this, yes? Yes, that's correct. Then, I'm sure you're well aware that he had 15 times the prescribed amount of Phenobarbital in his system. What's your point, Ms. Moore? As the investigating officer, I feel like you have ignored certain elements pertaining to my client. Why didn't you at least investigate the crash further? Because I think that he's a drug addict. There is nothing in his medical history to suggest that he had any substance abuse problems. Nothing! If you have any requests, why don't you put it in writing? Wait, please. A farmer from outside the city reported that some kind of animal attacked his horses. He was standing on two legs, over two meters tall, covered in hair, and called it a "monster from hell." That sure sounds like the animal that killed Henry Porter. We'll follow you. Yes, why don't you do that? Oh, my God. Jesus! That's impossible. There hasn't been a bear, a wild bear in this region for... A hundred years. This has to be the bear that attacked the Porters. It's all consistent, the area, the size of the animal. Gavin? We'll have to run some tests, but this is looking good. DNA results. We need Gavin. Gavin. I was just, uh, reading that there are certain strains of porphyria that are not only passed genetically, but in rare cases, they can be transmitted through blood or any mucous membrane. Just gonna turn this light on. So, um, I need you to look at this. Talan's DNA results, cross-contaminated again. Well, get them to do the test again. Actually, can you, um, ask them to send me both DNA analysis reports for both tests? Here. Hey. What's wrong? I don't know. I'm worried about you. No, don't. You should be worried about the case. Right, 'cause I'm never worried about my cases. Nothing's changed there then. Yeah. Mmm. Do you think he could have done it, Gavin? Look, there is no way a man could have done anything like that. Yeah. Yeah. You're doing a great job, Kate. Thanks for saying that. And you were right to move here. I should have come with you. I miss you, Kate. I miss you too. The day has come for Gwynek's specialized testing which could produce results that exonerate him of all criminal charges. Jesus! Um... Stop. Why are you helping me, Kate? Mmm. Because I was taught from a very young age that everyone deserves to be heard. Especially the ones that think they don't deserve it. They'll get what they want. Do you want me to quit? You thought about it though? Mmm. Yeah. Yeah, come in. Oh. Uh, Talan, these are my partners Eric and Gavin. You haven't officially met yet. Talan. Uh, Gavin is gonna explain a few of the specifics about the exam. So, okay? Okay, so, um, Talan, along with the normal battery of tests, the lead physician is also going to administer, um, uh, a corneal impression to get a cell sample of one of your eyes. Um, this will be the early indicator of the porphyria. After that, he's going to attempt a photic-induced seizure. A photic-induced seizure? It's strobing lights that will cause stress and trigger an attack. It's the only way to confirm the porphyria and allow it to be admissible in court. All right, we should get going. Guards! It's gonna work, right? It has to. Mrs. Gwynek, okay. Rineaux. Commencing the examination of patient Talan Gwynek. Okay, we will now do the corneal impression. Relax, Talan. The early indicator for porphyria is positive. Excellent, excellent. Now let's move on to seizure induction. Hmm. I will need you to stare at the flashing light. Uh, doctor? No, no, it's normal. We need to stop this right now. This is unusual. Doctor, please! Help, somebody! No, no, no! Gwynek, don't! How did this happen? He could barely move. That was not Talan. I hope you're happy, I hope you're happy! All this is on your head! How the hell were we supposed to know that this was going to happen? I knew! You got him transferred. He killed three people and now he's gone! I promise I was only doing what I thought was best for my client! I don't give a fuck! Just go! Go! Let me do my job. Go! Go! Go! You go! Fuck! Reports from Lyon indicate four more dead. Gwynek's whereabouts remain unknown. Where would our werewolf legends be? Put "luna" in the word lunatic. Researchers tracked down more than a thousand reported attacks and compared the dates with the lunar cycle. The most dangerous time following a full moon. Eric? You here? Eric? Hey. Hey. Did you spend all night here? Yeah. How you doing? You all right? Listen, uh, I'm glad you're here. Um, you know how we were wondering how it was even physically possible for Talan to destroy that hospital? Yeah. Okay, so, bear with me. You know how people say the full moon can make people go mad, crazy? Yeah? Okay. So, watch this. Put "luna" in the word lunatic, but do we really know what effect the moon has on our lives? Okay, look. The sky was so bright. There was a full moon. There's been these studies on epileptics where a full moon triggers these prolonged seizures. They have these violent outbursts and they get almost this, like, super human strength. It has something to do with water. You know how like the moon affects the tides, right? Mmm-hmm. Well, human beings have almost 60% water. I mean, it kind of makes sense, right? They even have a name for it. It's called the Lunar Effect. Okay, so... So you think he becomes what he is under the influence of the moon? What are you saying? Hey. Hey. Last night the moon was 98%. Tonight, full moon. What's this? It seems there's no more running for Gwynek. Police have the building surrounded. However, details on how he escaped a heavily guarded hospital wing remain unclear. I'm going. Yeah. I'm going to get my coat. Why? Pistor doesn't want you there. He's my client, Gavin. I have a responsibility. But he's a murderer, Kate. Leave it alone. I know he's a murderer, Gavin. I'm done defending him. - I don't know, I mean, if this Lunar Effect... - You coming? You're making a mistake, Kate! Yeah, I'm coming. A lot of people have died. I don't want them to die because of me, okay? Yeah, well, the person you're trying to save is a fucking animal! I know that, Gavin! What do you want me to say to you? Haven't you helped him kill enough people, Kate? What? All right, you need to stay here. I don't want to see you. Can you pull your shit together, please? Go, go, go! Uh, Katherine Moore... Pistor! What are you doing here? I told you to stay away. He is my client. I don't want to see anyone else hurt either, all right? Don't worry. He's on the eighth floor. He hasn't killed anyone yet. We have the situation under control. Control? You have no idea what you're dealing with here. Oh, really? Why don't you tell me, Mr. American. What are we dealing with here? I think he has this condition where his behavior is affected by the moon. The moon? What are you talking about? His violence isn't naturally there. Okay, okay, okay. All I know is I don't want any more innocent people killed by that maniac. He moves, he's dead. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Talan Gwynek. Pull your men back. Pull your men back. Right now! He's right. I don't want anyone else to die, all right? We got it. Get them out of there now! You don't know what you're talking about, okay? What have we done? Based on eyewitness reports, authorities believe he is headed to his home in Cerdon. Get in. Get in. Get in. I tried to tell you, Kate. I know, Gavin! Fuck, what happened to your eye? I saw the news, what happened? It was unlike anything I've ever seen, man. The guy fell 10 stories. It was like Planet of the Fucking Apes. He was standing right in front of us, Gavin. That thing inside of him, it was not Talan Gwynek. - It's like he wasn't even... - He wasn't even human? - Exactly. - I don't think he is. I looked at the DNA analysis reports Eric sent back to me. The results were exactly the same both times. The contamination patterns were identical. - The DNA just wasn't classifiable. - He's non-human? Yeah. He's non-anything. I don't know what he is. It looks like we're too late. She's not here. What's with all the security? I'd say she was afraid. What was she afraid of, huh? Now she's gone. She probably left to meet him somewhere. Fuck! What if that was her plan all along? No. What choice did she have? What are you talking about? Hang on, hang on, hang on. Think about it. If 500 years ago someone saw a man with Talan Gwynek's same appearance, that condition, okay? And that man was under the influence of the moon. This Lunar Effect, and it made him predatory and it made him this killer, this man eater. Wait, it sounds like you're talking about a loup-garou. A werewolf? Yes, they'd say that he was not human. He was a man and a beast like Talan Gwynek. All the more reason that his whole family should be exterminated. What? For 50 years they lived in peace. And then something bad happened. Talan's father was killed so that you could profit from their land. Kate. I just need some air. All right? Mrs. Gwynek? Mrs. Gwynek, are you in here? It's Katherine Moore. It's just me, okay? I know about the secret you've been hiding about your family. I know you're... I know you're, um... You're just trying to protect your son. If they killed your husband, we can help you. But Talan has to be stopped. Please come out. Please. - Fuck! - Sorry. Eric. Sorry. You go. You're not supposed to be here. Eric, I have an ax in my hand. Don't sneak up on me. What are you doing in here? Nothing. I thought I saw something. Yeah, I was worried about you. Let's get out of here. Where did the cop... Jesus Christ! Police! Talan Gwynek! I don't know. I don't know. At the rate he's moving, he could be anywhere. I don't think he's going to leave the forest. It's his home. The cave system here, he and his father spent a lot of time there. He grew up in those caves. Okay, we leave in one minute. He trusts you, so you're going to help me bring him in. Let's go! I'm not going. Why? I just need to figure some things out, Kate. I can't explain right now. I can't. Gavin, come on. What the hell is going on, really? What is this about? Show us your arm. Listen, what's going on? Mmm? Let me see your arm. Gavin! Gavin, let me go. Let me go! What is that? Oh. I got, uh... I got infected by Talan, um, in the police station. And that's why you're changing? Where did you get that? It doesn't matter. If I do anything, you use the gun. Okay? I'm scared. Me too. I hope you know who you're trusting. Gavin. If you decide to meet at the convoy, I'm ready to take you. Thank you, Officer. Shh! They found something. Let's go. Oh, my God. Stop. Stop. Stop. There's something. It's coming from that hole. Quiet. Shh! Hold on. Come on, you motherfucker. Show yourself. Fuck! What is that? Oh, shit! Talan! Talan. Talan, you don't want to hurt him. Okay? Talan. I know what this man did to you. Just... Just let him go. That's right. That's right, Talan. No one else has to die. That's right. Okay. - Kate? - Hey, are you feeling okay? Yeah, yeah, I feel pretty good. Listen, I've found a basement here. I think it was used as a holding cell for Talan. His mother knew all along. He's dead, Gavin. Hang on, I can hardly hear you. I tried to plead with him. They're taking his body to the morgue. Listen to me. If you start feeling anything... Kate, come on. I feel fine. Just be careful. Watch Pistor, Kate. He can't be trusted. Oh, Jesus! Let's see. Come back here. Oh, Jesus Christ! Okay, come here. Come here. Who did this to you? Can you tell me who did this to you? Look, I'm gonna get you some help. Okay? You said you'd protect him. Now look what you did. What's gonna happen to me? I don't know. I'm not your mother! But you won't ever be like him. Not with what you did. Your son did this to me. You all said you'd protect him. Your son did this to me. So what did Gavin tell you? Is he all right? He said he was fine, but I don't know. We don't know. It might be too late for him. He could be turning into what Talan is. A fucking animal. We don't know that. I pulled Gavin into this and I'm gonna help him. No matter what it takes. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Pistor's gonna do what he wants to do. He's gonna kill him and who's to say he's wrong? This is all about money to Pistor and I'm not gonna let him get away with killing Talan's father or Gavin. Eric! Get in the car! Eric, fuck, what are you doing? Sixty, 70 miles an hour. I couldn't catch him. I couldn't catch up with him. And they shot him, like, 10 times, and he didn't die. He didn't die, Kate. What does that mean? He can't be killed? Is that what that means? He can't be killed? Maybe they have to shoot him in the head. Is that what it is? Is that the only way that he can die? Eric! No! Kate, run. Talan, it's okay. No! It's fine. Talan, please, come on. None of these people understand you, and they never will. They're scared of you. But I can help you. Please, Talan. Talan. Talan, no. Talan, Talan, please, Talan. No, no, no, Talan, Talan. Talan, no! Talan, no! Talan! No! No! Fuck! Fuck! No! No! No! No! No! Please! Please! Gavin? No. No. It's a case that has horrified France... ...because of its brutality.

I'm glad to be here. Thanks for having me. Yes, it's hard to believe it's almost been a month. A couple found mutilated. I'm fine, thank you, and Kate's recovering well. A pregnant woman has been reported missing. No, no, I don't think he's dead at all. Family members say their son was on a backpacking trip... ...son was on a backpacking trip across Europe. But you ask how a human can do that and my answer is simple. He isn't human. A brutal slaying near Cologne. No, no, the reports are not embellished at all. I've seen what he can do. You've seen what he can do. Have you felt any side effects? Have you been affected in any way? An entire community is living in fear of what they're calling The Beast of Strasbourg. I'm completely serious when I say to you that Talan Gwynek, by the mere definition of the word... Is a werewolf.
