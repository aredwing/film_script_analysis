Let's get this joint jumping, yeah! Tomato juice fountain. Gross! Epic salad bar! It's everything a vegetarian vampire could hang a fang on! Hey, Draculaura! We're on, Gil. You like? Fabu-licious! Her birthday is Valentine's Day? You bet. Take a gander at her birthmark. The whole dang holiday was fashioned just for her. She's so lucky! No. I'm the one who's lucky. Clawd, you make my dreams come true. Which is why I got you this. And this, and those, and these. And... I painted that! O- M-Ghoul! Can this day get any better? Draculaura, in honor of your most special birthday, your father would like to give you a new car! So, that would be my dream party. Guess I need a reality check, right? Absolutely not! Your fantasy is our reality. In fact, we're gonna make it even better, aren't we? You ghouls are the best-est! Fantasies. Everybody has them. Congratulations, Ghoulia Yelps! Your scientific work has cured Mummengitis! Ghoulia, Ghoulia! Fantasies are great. Reality can be a bolt in the neck sometimes. It's nice to take a break. But sometimes, fantasies can become expectations. And when that happens, it can put a lot of pressure on the monsters in your life. It was Draculaura's Sweet 1600 and Valentine's Day! And to top it off, the whole holiday was created just for her 400 years ago. I'll tell you about that later. As official party planners, Cleo and Clawdeen realized that they had 1, 599 birthdays to live up to. So, what do you think? I think it sphinx. She did that for her 1521st birthday. We gotta step up our game. A little birdie told me you guys were throwing a purr-fectly epic party. We're here for our invites. Please, Toralei. You're not coming. Give me one good reason why not? Uh... How about three? Fine. Just remember, every kitty has her day. So better watch your backs. Oh, we're so scared. Hey, ghouls! How goes the Party planning? Great! Right, Cleo? Oh, totes-ma-ghost! We're gonna throw you the party of the millennium. Hey, Clawd, what you got there, big bro? A little something-something for Draculaura. Oh! You shouldn't have. I bet it's way romantic! Black roses? Candy skulls? Bowl of yak meat? What? Yak meat is delicacy. It's a study guide for her driver's ed test. You can only take that test twice, or you have to wait another six months to get your license. Oh! You shouldn't have. Really. Really. I guess I'd better go study right now. You got a ghoul like Draculaura a practical gift? Bad wolfie! Ow! What? Her hopes for her Sweet 1600 are higher than the pyramids. Now those would make a great gift! Nah, I got her something that'll make her howl at the moon! Ugh! You don't like it? No way. We had to tell Clawd that the necklace was nice, but he was going to have to think of something that would knock her bolts off. Pressure was way intense. Caller number five, you're on with Cupid, Goddess of Love. Tell me, what matters to your heart? We were all huge fans of Cupid's show, and we listened to it every day. She's a love genius, an expert on romance. Got a problem with love? She can fix it. Yeah. So, like, I really like this boy, right? Total crush-o-rama. But he doesn't even know I'm, like, there. I hear you, caller. This Is something we can all relate to. There's a monster we like, somebody we just know we'd be perfect for. If they would just notice us... Let me ask you, caller. Are you invisible? Yeah, that's what I'm like, saying. It's like he can't even see me! No, sweetie, are you actually invisible? Oh, dooiy! Uh... Hang on. Hey- Hey- Oh, my ghoul! Like, thanks, Cupid! See? She's the ghoul! Do not understand why play these games. In mountains, village elders choose a date for you, spit in hand... Ugh. Shake, end of story. Is no muss, is no fuss. Okay, is little muss. So, which bloke you gonna take to the party? That is a problem. What's caught in her net? She can't decide between Slow Moe and Don of the Dead. She's a monster of science, not romance. Too bad science can't decide for her. Oh... Oh! Good luck! Good luck! Caller 15, what matters to your heart? Yeah, um, I have this... I mean, my "friend" has this problem. What do you buy the ghoul that has everything? Oh, I hear you caller. My advice is not to buy her anything. Find her something personal. Something that says you listen. I don't have all of my powers yet. I can't reach anything. I got it. Thanks, Cupid. You the man. Uh... The ghoul. Clawd? Now you can get up to your locker, no prob. See? I wanted to prove that... That's what you think of me? You think I'm short? Aw... Clawd found out the hard way that expectations can be a real bop on the nose. Ouch. Clawd was totally in the doghouse with Draculaura. And now I was about to find out that he had a lot to live up to. Aw, maybe I'm hoping for too much. It's just that Valentine's Day brings back so many memories for me. But you ghouls all know that story. Yes. Heard it a thousand times. I haven't. I want to hear it. Oh, I don't really want to get into it now. Oh, okay. Never mind. Well, fine, if you're gonna twist my arm. It is the most romantic story ever told and it all started at my old school. Like, vampire old. His name was Valentine. And he was the most romantic monster ever. Every ghoul in school was fangs over heels for him. But he chose me. We met at a Mock Witch Trial. For no creature as fair as this, with eyes as bright as a full moon, with skin as soft as a ghost's kiss, and a heart as pure as snow, can possibly be a witch. Not guilty That is so beautiful. You both get A's! He was amazing in every way. He wrote me the most exquisite poetry. And every moment we spent together was something out of a fairytale. And for my birthday, he gave me the greatest gift I've ever received. He created a holiday just for me! Valentine's Day! Happy Birthday, darlin'. You have the biggest heart. Almost full of love. Tonight, I shall make it mine, forever. But that night, my family had to flee, due to a misunderstanding with the locals. And I never saw him again. That's so sad. I wasn't asleep, Mr. Rotter! Oh! He was my first love and he was everything I ever wanted. You only knew him for aweek. It was supposed to be forever. He seems pretty self-obsessed to me. Don't you think it's weird that he made a holiday for you, but named it after himself? Whatever, it doesn't matter. What we had is all buried in the past. I'm with Clawd now. And he's just different. I better go get ready for my driver's test. "I better go ready for my driver's test. " Won't invite us to the party, huh? Then we'll just have to ruin it! All this math has got your head swimming round like a blind tuna. You gotta ask yourself, what does your heart want? Here, let's write up a list of pros and cons for both blokes on your computer. You're writing a program to decide your perfect match? Science doesn't have all the answers, you know. Sorry! Just saying that love is a mystery, dipped in secret sauce. There is a magic to it. Mmm, mmm, mmm. There's nothing more beautiful than a full heart. Valentine, how may I romance you? Who are you talking to on the phone? Mom, I got it. Jeez! Valentine? Draculaura. Ah! Smooth, man, real smooth. Copasetic, Valentino. Ice cold, daddy-o. Oh. Sugar! I have been waiting ages to hear your sweet buttery tones. Who are you talking to on the telephone? Mom! Get off the line. You want me to transfer to Monster High? Surely, anything for you, darling. You hear me? If you don't clean up all this batguna... Yes, Mom, chores first! Hang up! Apologies. I can't wait to see you, Valentine, my love. Cupid, I'm begging here. Like, hey, Valentine, why are you so crazy about this vampire chick? Because Draculaura's perfect. She's one of a kind. And she has such a big heart. The biggest heart of any monster there ever was. She completes me. She completes my collection. All I have to do to harvest your heart, is fill it to 100% with love. I was nearly there, but then you got away. That won't happen this time. If you don't clean up your batguna, it's sunlight for you, son. Yes, Mom, I know. I just want to make her happy. You need to remind her why she fell in love with you in the first place. Cleo and Clawdeen knew of a secret place buried deep below Monster High, that would be perfect for the party. The catacombs! The map says there should be an old concert hall somewhere around here. Ugh! Hasn't anyone heard of GPS? Look, a door. There must be a key around here somewhere. A skullet key! Those open everything! Whoa. What's that smell? Totally. Who died in here? Oh, my ghoul! Well, that was a close shave! Operetta. Thanks. Y'all nearly fell into "the Cauldron of Eternal Body Odor. " One dip in there and whoo-ee... You'll stink like a polecat for a thousand years! What brings you by? Draculaura wants her birthday party here. Well, then, let me rope this off for you. Perfect! Now, all we need is a few thousand scented candles. Let's get to work. The program's done? So, who is your perfect match? Yeah, Don or Slow Moe? Well, what are you waiting for? Hey, hot stuff! Heath Burns! Heath Burns! Hoffa! Clawd had finally figured out what to get Draculaura. Something she couldn't get anywhere else. Check it out. Oh, a box of junk. How thoughtful. Yeah, you can't give her a bunch of stuff that you dug up from the backyard. It's not a box of junk, it's... What's that about? Is there a sale somewhere? Why wasn't I told? Ghoulia! Did you read my blog? A hot new boy just transferred to Monster High! I heard that he was looking for Draculaura. Who could it be? How am I doing? All right, no mistakes. But I was looking forward to failing somebody. Just parallel park and you survive your driver's test. Mess up, and it's off with your grade. Valentine? You fail. Valentine! I'm Toralei. Pleased to meet ya, darlin'. I'm... Valentine, yes. I know all about you. I see my reputation precedes me. And I know you're here for Draculaura's heart. Hush, now! Look, she called me. She didn't call you. I did. You did? Why? To help you get past her guard dog. The furry fellow? Her boyfriend. Boyfriend? Relax. Clawd doesn't have a romantic tuft of fur on his whole body. He's no threat. He sure is big. Aw... It's okay, fraidy cat, the big, bad woof is leaving. Now, get over there and do what you do best. Well, all right, now we're talking. Why are you doing this, anyway, pretty kitty? Let's just call it a birthday present from the heart. Mmm-hmm. Draculaura. Draculaura. My Valentine. How romantic! Ah... The attention Draculaura was getting from Val was making her batty with glee. 'Course, that much glee is hard to hide. What's going on with you and Valentine? What? What are you talking about? Everybody knows that you guys have been hanging out. It's all over school. It's even in Spectra's blog. Okay, okay. We've been spending a little time together. So? So? Are you forgetting that you already have a boyfriend? In my village, they have name for this, Problustravitch. Not cool! Do not tell him I said this, but my brother's a great guy. And he cares about you so much. I know, I know. And I care about him. But Val is just so dreamy and romantic, and amazing. Clawd may be smelly and annoying, but he's not stupid. He's going to find out about this. I'm telling you this as your best ghoulfriend. You can't have it both ways. You gotta make a choice. Holy smokes! I'm Ghoulia's perfect match! Apparently her scientific research showed that you two were the most compatible. Dude, now I know why I'm having so much trouble in Mr. Hack's class. Science does not make any sense. Neither does Mr. Hack. "Oye, oye. All right, now see 'ere, children!" Heath, Ghoulia's a very nice, sweet, shy ghoul. She's kind of a fish out of water when it comes to dating. We were hoping you could be a little, um, you know... Less Heath-y? Yes! Yes! Less Heath-y? Are you kidding me? I'm her perfect match. I'm gonna turn it up to 451 Heath-grees! This is gonna be bad. This is gonna be awesome. Bad. I mean bad. Yeah, this is gonna be bad. Draculaura had a problem. She was torn between the two boys. Oops. Clawd. And Valentine. But in the end, Draculaura knew the answer. Oh, Val, that's so sweet! You know me, darlin'. My heart is in your hands. Or vice versa, if you catch my drift. Listen, I've really enjoyed all of this. All the gifts and attention and everything. But it's not real. What? I've got something real with Clawd. I didn't want to have to resort to this. But, I'm gonna have your heart, darlin', one way or the next. Draculaura? You, you, you Got dumped! You're really gonna ride this wave in? Now, with most Dead Languages, in order to conjugate the verb, we first must... Oh, no! Very good, Clawdeen. But it's pronounced "Ahhno. " It is the rare Ghost of Christmas Past tense. They broke up! Vampy puts Doggy outside for good. Now that it was official... Clawd was howling in pain. Hey, over here, I'm open! We had to talk to Draculaura. But we couldn't find her anywhere, which was way weird. Any luck, mate? No. She won't answer her phone. And I've texted her, like, 20 times. Good thing my dad pays the bill. Oh, I am so mad at her. How could she do this to Clawd? Love makes monsters do silly things. Good call, Ghoulia. Maybe she is taking her driver's test now! But she wasn't there either. Ha! You failed! We finally ran into her and Valentine as they were leaving Study Howl. And that's when we realized something was way wrong. Draculaura, we need to talk, like, now. Where have you been? With Val. I had all my classes changed. That way, he and I will never be apart! What about my brother? Which one? You have, like, 10. You better not be acting all weird like this at your party. Oh, I can't make it. What? Valentine says he has something extra special planned for my birthday! It'll be heart-stopping. Lates! Oh, no, is the party off? Boo-hoo-hoo. I can't believe we spent so much time on this to have her blow us off! If she wasn't immortal... I don't know, gills, something's amiss. Yeah, she's not behaving like herself at all. Her Sweet 1600 party meant so much to her. All of sudden, she not care. Very odd. You're right. There's one ghoul who can get to the bottom of this. Spectra? We need a favor. TORALEl: Isn't this amazing? Everyone's miserable, Draculaura and Clawd are toast, and the party is canceled! This is gonna be the best birthday ever. And it's not even mine! I wish I could say the same, darlin '. Operation Steal Her Heart not going so hot? It's moving slower than molasses. Her love for that hound was stronger than I considered. I thought you hypnotized her. I did, but I still have to fill her heart completely with love. Else I can't harvest it and put it in my trophy case. I just need to make sure I get it soon. Why the rush? This is fun! The spell will become permanent in three days, her birthday. And she'll be stuck in that state forever. Her heart will disappear like smoke. She'll be incapable of loving anyone ever. Even me. And no heart, no trophy. Either way, I win. Good luck. This is so juicy. I better send this video to the ghouls. Fast! A spell? Steal her heart? I'll pound him! Ghoulia's right. Getting rid of Valentine without breaking the spell would be a voltageous fail! She'd be a total zombie! No offense. So how do we break it? 'Cause I really wanna pound him. Who knows the most about the awesome powers of love? Cupid, it's a love emergency! If he put her under a spell, in order to break it, we're gonna need this. Hand me my bow. Uh... You couldajust opened it. That's the key right there. Oh! Cupid was gonna shoot Draculaura with an arrow, which would make her fall in love with the first monster she saw. And we were gonna make sure that monster was Clawd. Ghoulia... Now's not a good a time, Heath. This is one fire you can't put out, Lagoona. Whoa! See, she's crazy about me! I'd offer you this pepper, but you're already so hot, darlin'. You make my heart so happy. And full? It swells with every moment I spend with you. Yes, I can tell. Ready? I've never seen a monster with powers like his. One arrow won't be strong enough to break the spell. Hurry. Here they come. Use two, then. We're running out of time! Look out! That went well. Valentine's Day was tomorrow! Ghoulia was still trying to make it work with Heath. After all, science can't be wrong! Can it? Ghoulia! I wrote you a killer tune. It starts with a smokin' guitar solo. Thank you, thank you. You've been a great audience. I love you. You can applaud now. And as for Clawd and Draculaura? They were madly in love with the wrong monsters! Once they got shot by the arrows, Cupid and Clawd were inseparable and nothing else mattered to them. Oh! Ow! What? Bad wolfie! Snap out of it! Look, sis, we're happy. Can't you just be happy for us? Cupid, come on, your arrows caused this. You know that, right? All I remember is looking into his puppy-dog eyes and never wanting to look away. Ugh! Gag! Look, how do we break the spell? Why would I tell you? Why would you want to? Because of her! Draculaura? She seems happy, too. She's in danger! Don't be a hater, sis. Love is magical! That's what I'm trying to tell you! And poor Draculaura. With every romantic gesture, she was falling deeper and deeper under Valentine's control. A shower of kisses. The doves will be flyin'. Come tomorrow night, your heart will be mine. Oh, Valentine, that was so romantic. Apparently, not romantic enough. We had to stop Valentine before he stole Draculaura's heart forever. There's gotta be something in here that'll break these spells! There is nothing in here but games and tricks. I do not understand why monsters trust her so much. Uh... She's Cupid. She knows more about love than anyone. Her bow and arrows! She just left them here. Well, these are too dangerous to be lying around. I'll put them in my locker. I don't think... What you want? Cupid? She not here. I'm Abbey, I help. Well, I like this ghoul, but I don't know how to talk to her. Be direct. Do not waste breath on flowery introductions. Say, "Hello. I like you. You like me?" See? Is easy. Uh... Okay. lam natural. They like you. Because I do not play games. Hey, that not bad. You're on with Abbey, where love is not game. Go! Ghoulia was looking for info on Valentine and Cupid. She asked Heath to help so she could finally prove science was right. Secret admirer? No, no. In my village, if there is no name on package, it get sent back to post office. Whoa! Your friend just totally owned that dude! Crash and burn! Owww! Shh... Yeah, right, right, right. I'll get that for you, hot stuff! Whoa! That's just on the surface. What's taking so long? Crikey, it's almost her birthday! We don't have much time, gills. Why couldn't my brother just be more romantic in the first place? It's not his fault. Valentine hypnotized her! He let her get away from him, Frankie. I mean, his big gift to her was gonna be this box of junk. And now, every time I try to talk to him, he and Cupid keep waggin' their tongues about the power of "true love. " And that's when it hit me. There was something in that box more powerful than Cupid's and Valentine's powers put together. Guys! I have a plan. But we need to get everyone in the same room at the same time. But how? A party! We're back, baby! Cleo and Clawdeen made copies of the skullet key and used them as invitations. Jackson, come to Draculaura's party? A party? Me? Awesome. Actually, it's for Holt Hyde. We need a DJ. Draculaura's party? Hey, you guys, wanna come to Draculaura's party? Yeah, that way everyone can see us and see how in love we are! See how in love we are! Great! G ro-to-the-ross. How's it going with Heath? Maybe science wasn't the answer after all. That's when Ghoulia realized that her science was sound. It was her computer that was the problem. There was a bug in the program! She was never supposed to be with Heath! Yeah, yeah, you were right. How're ya gonna break it to him? Hmm... I found Draculaura and Valentine. And now, to get them to the party. So, what do you say? There's no time for that. Her birthday should be all about filling her heart with love, completely. Well, I know nothing fills her heart faster than a party in her honor. Hmm. Then we'll be there. Count on it! Perfect! Man! Yeah! Hyde in the house! Yo, yo, yo, it's ya boy, Holt Hyde, on the Squeals of Steel! Uh-huh. Okay, Frankie, what's your plan? Okay, Ghoulia found out that Cupid's arrows' powers only work if the bow is intact. The magic is in the bow! If we smash the bow, Clawd and Cupid will be released! That is fur-rific news! Toralei! Toralei! Come on, we gotta find her before she wreaks havoc! Let's split up. We had to find Toralei and figure out a way to smash the bow, freeing Clawd and Cupid. That way, Clawd could give Draculaura the box. We're almost there, fellas. Just a smidge more, and we can skedaddle on outta this one-dragon school. But we had to do it before the spell became permanent. Time was running out! Deuce! Have you seen Toralei? Nah, babe. Why, what's up? They say love hurts. Let's find out. Oh... Cleo? Hey, gorgeous. Where've I been all my life? Cleo, are you okay? How dare you touch me? Oh, no! Hey, Gil, I... Gills! We have to do something! But what? If we step out, she will shoot us with bow. She'd have to catch me first. Clawdeen's plan was brilliant. She was going to use herself as bait. It was risky, but it was the only chance we had to stop Toralei. Aw... Look who's lying like a dog just waiting for this kitty to scratch. Did it work? Oh! Cleo? Hey, Deuce. I missed you. Whoa! What's going on? No time to explain. Clawd, you gotta give this to Draculaura. Hurry! Are you sure? You guys said she'd hate it. Trust me. Draculaura? I have a birthday gift for you. Get along, little doggy. She made her choice, ya dig? I don't even know why you try. A mangy mutt like you could never make a ghoul like Draculaura happy. That's it. It's on! Let me down! You don't know anything about her! I did make her happy. Draculaura, look in the box. The spell Valentine put on Draculaura was powerful. Remember! It's working! But I knew there was one thing stronger. Hey. Real, true, mind-blowing love. Everything about Val was faker than a Vampire's tan. But Clawd was real. And real beats fake any day of the week. Even on Valentine's Day. What just happened here? You, you, you Got dumped! Shut it, you bunch of cumulo-nincompoops! I'm Valentine, dig? I can get any ghoul I want. You know what, Valentine? It's time everyone knew how much your love stinks. Where are you going? My Power, it's gone! You, you stink! Mom! Valentine was a very powerful monster. But it was all superficial. There was nothing on the inside. And once the outside was gone, so was his power. Oh... Can you ever forgive me? There's nothing to forgive. Fantasies. It's okay to have them. You are the most amazing guy I've ever known. I wish there was something I... Here's a stick. Ready? But when fantasies get in the way of what's real, you gotta let 'em go. We hope you like the party. We know it's not exactly what you wanted. Are you kidding? This party is off the fang! It's perfect! Thank you so much! Because sometimes, reality can be better than the fantasy. And one final present... We talked to Mr. Hack, explained everything. He's going to let you take the driver's test again. Oh, my ghoul! I'm going to get to drive my car! Here you go. Ithought you might want it back. So romantic. Truth is in love and in life, you never know what to expect. Here he comes. Be gentle when you break it off with him, mate. He's really fallen for ya. Listen, it looks like there's an opening for Stud Of The Century since Val's out of commission. I can't be tied down right now. Don't wanna disappoint all the ladies. No hard feelings? Hey, hot stuff, wanna dance? Caller, you need to be subtle. Laugh at his jokes, even if they're bad. I'm going to pretend I did not hear that. Caller, you must be direct, look him in eye, tell him how you feel. If he no feel same, move along. And while that may cause some arguments, isn't that what makes it freaky and fabulous?
