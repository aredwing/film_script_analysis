JUST ANSWER THE PHONE, TAKE CARE OF MY ACCOUNTS AND MY CORRESPONDENCE. I'M NO GOOD AT PAPERWORK. I'M SORRY, MR. FRANZ. I COULDN'T. [Phone rings] I HAVE NO ONE TO HELP ME WITH MY DOLLS. I WORK ALONE. I NEED SOMEONE IN THE OFFICE. WHATEVER YOU DO, YOUR WORK WILL BE SATISFACTORY. I PAY THE USUAL WAGES, BUT IF THAT ISN'T ENOUGH, I COULD MANAGE A LITTLE MORE. WON'T YOU PLEASE TRY IT?

ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME WHERE HE IS? PLEASE, DON'T GET ME INTO TROUBLE. MR. FRANZ IS IN THE BACK ROOM. WHEN HE'S IN THAT ROOM, HE NEVER WANTS TO BE DISTURBED. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, DON'T GET EXCITED. BUT CAN'T YOU SEND UP SOME SMOKE SIGNALS OR SOMETHING? CALL HIM ON THE PHONE. HE'D BE FURIOUS. MR. FRANZ, FURIOUS? THEY DON'T COME ANY MILDER THAN HIM. ARE YOU AFRAID OF HIM?

I DON'T KNOW MISS HALL'S NEW ADDRESS, BUT I EXPECT HER TO STOP BY IN A DAY OR TWO. I'LL SEE SHE GETS THIS. THANK YOU. COME ON IN, BOB. SORRY IF I HURT YOUR FEELINGS. I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, BOB. [Sally] HOW BEAUTIFUL! [Franz] YES, VERY NICE. THE PRICE DOESN'T SEEM TOO OUT OF LINE. I'LL TAKE FOUR GROSS OF THAT. WHAT DO YOU LIKE, MY DEAR? THIS ONE HERE. THE WHITE ORGANDY WITH THE BLUE RIBBONS. IT'S A PITY YOU CAN'T MODEL IT FOR US. [Franz] I CAN SEE IT WOULD BE VERY BECOMING ON YOU. YES. WELL, TWO GROSS OF THE STRAPLESS ORGANDY, AND TWO OF THE NEGLIGEE. [Salesman]HOW ABOU LINGERIE TO GO WITH IT? [Franz] YES, YOU CAN PUT THAT IN, TOO. WHEN CAN YOU DELIVER THEM? [Franz] YES. [Salesman]TEN DAYS. ALL RIGHT? WILL THAT BE ALL, MR. FRANZ? [Franz] DO YOU MIND IF I KEEP THIS STRAPLESS ORGANDY? YOU CAN CHARGE IT TO MY ORDER. I THINK THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MR. FRANZ. THANK YOU, MISS. HERE, LET ME GET RID OF SOME OF THIS STUFF FOR YOU. MISS REYNOLDS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D EVER DO WITHOUT YOU. [Phone rings] YES, MISS REYNOLDS. WHO? NO! BY ALL MEANS, TELL HIM I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. AN OLD FRIEND OUT OF THE PAST IS HERE TO SEE ME. SHALL WE CALL IT A DAY? I'D HAVE TO STOP SOON TO MIX MORE PLASTIC. SO, YOU'LL FORGIVEME, WON'T YOU? CERTAINLY, SIR. MY DEAR FRIEND,HOW ARE YOU? EMIL! EMIL,WHAT A SURPRISE. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD. I ARRIVEDYESTERDAY. WITH YOUR PUPPETS? OF COURSE. MY PUPPETS OPEN THEIR SHOW NEXT MONDAY. I SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH FOR YOU TO COME AND MEET THEM. GOOD. OF COURSE, I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO. HOW DID YOU EVER FIND ME? WELL, I THOUGHT I'D NEED THE SERVICES OF A MARIONETTE-MAKER WHILE I WAS HERE. SO, I OPENED THE DIRECTORY AND THERE WAS YOUR NAME. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, FRANZ. NO MORE SHOW BUSINESS, HUH? NO, NO, I GAVE THAT UP. I JUST HAVE DOLLS NOW. DOLLS, HUH? MANY, MANY DOLLS, AS YOU CAN SEE. AS LONG AS YOU ENJOY IT. TELL ME, HOW'S YOUR DEAR EMMA? EMMA, EMMA... THE GIRL WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HAIR, YOUR WIFE. I HAVE TRIED SO LONG TO FORGET THAT NAME, I SOMETIMES ALMOST SUCCEED. SHE LEFT ME. WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN? MY MARIONETTES WERE PLAYING IN LUXEMBOURG. SHE RAN AWAY WITH SOMEONE SHE LIKED BETTER. AN ACROBAT. ACRO-- THA MUST'VE HURT. HOW THA MUST'VE HURT. BUT, I'M HAPPY NOW AT ANY RATE, AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS. EMIL, LET ME TAKE YOU TO DINNER. WHY NOT, WHY NOT? WE'LL HAVE TIME TO STOP AT THE THEATER AND VISIT YOUR MARIONETTES. THAT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA, FRANZ. SO, LET US GO. WAIT TILL YOU MEE MY LITTLE PUPPETS. BRAVO, BRAVO. EXCELLENT, FRANZ. EXCELLENT. YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN A PERFORMANCE LIKE THAT IN AGES. WELL, WELL, WELL. THIS IS LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS, HUH, FRANZ? YOU WERE ONCE THE BEST IN OUR PROFESSION. YOU STILL COULD BE, IF YOU WANTED TO. WELL, YOU SEE, THINGS HAVE BEEN GETTING TOO MUCH FOR ME LATELY AND I'VE BEEN THINKING OF A PARTNER. WHAT ABOU JOINING ME, HUH? IT DOESN'T INTEREST ME. WHY NOT? BECAUSE MY MARIONETTES ARE OLD AND NEED ATTENTION? I DON'T MIND REPAIRING THEM, IT ISN'T THAT. WHAT IS IT, THEN? I'M CONTENT IN MY DOLL FACTORY. ISN'T IT TIME WE ATE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, MY FRIEND? WHY MUST SOMEONE WHO'S CONTENT WITH THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM? CONTENTMENT IS UNNATURAL. EMMA'S LEAVING MUST'VE DONE YOU A GREAT DEAL OF HARM, MY BOY. YOU THINK SO? YOU'VE RUN AWAY FROM LIFE. YOU'VE SURROUNDED YOURSELF WITH ALL SHAPES OF PEOPLE: THEIR FACES, THEIR LEGS, THEIR ARMS... EVEN LITTLE MANNEQUINS OF THEM. BUT NOT THEIR SPIRIT. YOU'RE AFRAID OF THAT. WELL, I'VE FOUND PEACE, ANYHOW. WILL IT LAST? I HAVE NO FEAR IT WON'T. I LOVE MY DOLLS AND I'M QUITE SURE. THEY'LL NEVER LEAVE ME. LET'S FORGET ABOUT THE PAST, EMIL, AND HAVE A GOOD TIME, HUH? LIVING IN THE PRESENT IS THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING. AFTER DINNER, WE'LL GO BACK TO MY SHOP, HUH? EXCELLENT IDEA. HOW ABOUT THAT? HAPPY? UH-HUH. DID YOU PICK THIS SHOW FOR ANY PARTICULAR REASON? I GET TIRED OF THE SAME THINGS ALL THE TIME. DON'T YOU? YES, I DO. SUCH AS WHAT? DOLLS. WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE A FREAK? PLEASE, SIR, I... THIS IS HOW IT FEELS TO BE SO BIG YOU CAN STICK YOUR FIST THROUGH A CIRCUS TOP! [Colossal Man] LIKE A CLOWN! MR. FRANZ SAID YOU WERE GOING BACK TO ST. LOUIS TOMORROW. MAYBE. [Colossal Man] I CAN GROW TO BE 100 FEET TALL! AND I DON'T NEED A CHANGE OF WARDROBE. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME WITH ME? WHAT WOULD I DO IN ST. LOUIS? LIVE IN A PRETTY LITTLE HOUSE. BECOME MRS. BOB WESTLEY. [Colossal Man] "MAN LIVES THROUGH PLUTONIUM BLAST." THAT'S A GREAT JOKE, ISN'T IT, SERGEANT? WHY DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN HANGING AROUND ALL THESE WEEKS? WHAT DO YOU SAY? I DON'T KNOWWHAT TO SAY. THEN DON'T SAY ANYTHING. [Colossal Man] WANT TO GO BACK AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THE MONSTER? THE CIRCUS FREAK? THAT'S RIGHT, SERGEANT. I'M A CIRCUS FREAK. HAVE A TENT, WILL TRAVEL. WHY DON'T YOU MAKE A SIGN SAYING: "SEE THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN"? SAY, I GO A TERRIFIC IDEA. WHY DON'T WE FLY TO LAS VEGAS TOMORROW AND GET MARRIED? I COULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT TELLING MR. FRANZ I'M GOING. WELL, LET ME TELL HIM. I'LL SEE HIM FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. YOU GET PACKED AND BE READY. I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 10:00. HOW'S THAT? WONDERFUL. [Colossal Man] I'M NOT GROWING, YOU'RE SHRINKING! [Phone rings] [Sally]HELLO? [Franz]MISS REYNOLDS. IS ANYTHING THE MATTER? WHEN YOU DIDN'T COME TO THE OFFICE THIS MORNING, I BEGAN TO WORRY. HASN'T MR. WESTLEY BEEN TO SEE YOU? YES, HE WAS HERE EARLIER, BUT HE'S LEFT. [Sally] WHERE DID HE GO? BACK TO ST. LOUIS, I BELIEVE. [Franz] MISS REYNOLDS? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES. CAN I EXPECT YOU AT THE OFFICE THIS MORNING? YES. I'LL BE THERE. [Franz] ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU ARE. NOW THINGS ARE AS THEY SHOULD BE. BY THE WAY, I LEFT THE BILL FOR THOSE ST. LOUIS SHIPMENTS ON YOUR DESK. I'LL SEE TO THEM RIGHT AWAY. MR. FRANZ, DID BOB GO BY AIR? NO. BY TRAIN. I BELIEVE HE HAD HIS TICKET ALL READY. IT WAS VERY SUDDEN. HE'D BEEN NEGLECTING HIS BUSINESS LATELY. IT PROBABLY CAUGHT UP WITH HIM. DIDN'T HE TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT ME? YES, HE DID. HE TOLD ME THAT HE'D ASKED YOU TO MARRY HIM, AND THAT YOU HAD CONSENTED. WHEN'S IT TO BE? HE DIDN'T... I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T SET THE DATE. BOB GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED FOR ME AFTER YOU WERE MARRIED. I BEGGED HIM NOT TO TAKE YOU AWAY. I TOLD HIM HOW SAD IT IS WHEN PEOPLE GO. [Franz] OH, MY DEAR. I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU UNHAPPY. IS IT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T COME AND SAY GOODBYE? THAT WASN'T THOUGHTFUL OF HIM. WILL YOU LISTEN TO AN OLD FRIEND? PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU TRIED TO FORGET HIM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. THAT'S NOT TRUE, I DO KNOW. BOB WOULDN'T TREAT ME THIS WAY IF HE COULD HELP IT. SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO HIM. WHEN DID YOU MAKE THIS, MR. FRANZ? WHILE BOB WAS HERE. IT COULD BE HIM, ALMOST. THANK YOU FOR THE COMPLIMENT. THE AIM OF EVERY COMPOSER IS TO FIT THE WORLD WITHIN THE LIMITS OF HIS SYMPHONY. [Franz] A WRITER WANTS TO PUT ALL OF LIFE BETWEEN THE COVERS OF HIS BOOK. IF I CAN MAKE MY DOLLS IN THE IMAGE OF THOSE I KNOW AND LOVE, I'M SATISFIED. IT'S A SMALL TALENT, I KNOW, BUT I HAVE TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT. IT'S THE ONLY ONE I HAVE. I'LL BE OUT OF THE OFFICE FOR AN HOUR OR SO, MISS REYNOLDS. WILL YOU LOCK UP, MY DEAR? I HAVE MY OWN KEY. PARDON ME. CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE SERGEANT PATERSON IS? THANK YOU. SERGEANT PATERSON? YES. I'M SALLY REYNOLDS. THE MAN AT THE DESK SENT ME TO YOU. OH, YES. SIT DOWN, MISS REYNOLDS. HERE IT IS. YOU SAY IN THIS REPORT YOU MADE DOWNSTAIRS THAT YOUR FIANCE DISAPPEARED MYSTERIOUSLY. JUST WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? SOMETHING MR. FRANZ DID TO HIM. SUCH AS? MR. FRANZ DIDSOMETHING TO HIM. YOU SAID THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO PUT IT. DID HE HIT HIM? DID HE SHOOT HIM? DID HE STRANGLE HIM? NO, HE... YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME. WELL, THAT'S MY BUSINESS. NOW TELL ME, JUST WHAT DID HE DO? HE MADE BOB INTO A DOLL. HE MADE YOUR FIANCE INTO A DOLL. I SEE. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IF WE LEARN ANYTHING, MISS REYNOLDS. I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. SUPPOSE THERE WERE SOME OTHER PEOPLE THAT DISAPPEARED THE SAME WAY? WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING THEN? THAT ALL DEPENDS. WHO WERE THEY? JANET HALL. ANYONE ELSE? A MAILMANNAMED ERNIE. ERNIE LARSON. GO ON. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? I GUESS IT IS. OKAY. LET'S GO SEE THIS MR. FRANZ. HE'S TAKEN BOB DOWN. HE MUST HAVE HIM INSIDE. [Sergeant] IS THIS THE MAN? [Sally] YES. THE LADY SAYS YOU'VE BEEN MAKING PEOPLE DISAPPEAR MYSTERIOUSLY. [Sergeant] TURNING THEM INTO DOLLS. WHY, MISS REYNOLDS, WHAT MADE YOU SAY SUCH A THING? [Franz] THAT'S PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS. [Sergeant] IS THAT WESTLEY? [Sergeant] HOW COME IT LOOKS JUST LIKE HER BOYFRIEND? I MODEL ALL MY DOLLS AFTER PEOPLE I KNOW AND LIKE. PEOPLE I LIKE TO HAVE NEAR ME. [Franz] THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, IS THERE? [Sergeant] MAY ISEE IT, PLEASE? [Franz] CERTAINLY. IT'S LIFELIKE, ALL RIGHT. [Franz] I SHOULD HOPE SO. BUT I ASSURE YOU, IT'S ONLY A DOLL. WATCH. [Franz] WHAT DID YOU EXPECT, DEAR? THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF PLASTIC. YOU SEE, HERE'S A WHOLE CASE FULL OF THEM. LOOKS LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND KIND OF TOOK A POWDER, DOESN'T IT? OKAY. I'LL PUT THROUGH A TRACER ON HIM, ANYWAY. BE SEEING YOU. FEEL FREE TO DROP IN ANYTIME, SERGEANT. [Sergeant] THANK YOU. YOU WEREN'T THINKING OF GOING TOO, WERE YOU, DEAR? OF COURSE. PLEASE, DON'T. IT WOULD MAKE ME SO UNHAPPY. DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO WORK FOR YOU AFTER ALL THIS? I THINK OF YOUR PRETTY EYES AND YOUR LOVELY VOICE, AND THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS ON YOUR DESK, AND I ASK MYSELF, HOW COULD I EVER BEAR TO LET YOU GO? BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. NOW WHY DO YOU SAY THAT, MY DEAR? BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND BEING IN THIS PLACE ANOTHER MINUTE. IT'S LOCKED. OPEN THE DOOR. IT'S LOCKED. NO, NO! [Intense, high-pitched drone] [Franz] BE CAREFUL, MY DEAR. YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF ME, ARE YOU? WHY, I'M YOUR FRIEND. [Franz] YOU MUSTN'T FEEL BAD, MISS REYNOLDS. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO PUT ON YOUR NEW CLOTHES. YOU DON'T WANT TO MEET YOUR FIANCE DRESSED IN NOTHING BUT A NAPKIN, DO YOU? [Franz] HERE THEY ARE. FIRST YOUR TOILET ARTICLES. [Franz] AND YOUR STOCKINGS. AND THE DRESS. IT'S VERY PRETTY. YOU REMEMBER YOU SELECTED THIS YOURSELF? [Franz] YOU WANT TO MAKE YOURSELF LOOK NICE, I'M SURE. YOU'RE GOING TO MEET BOB. SHALL I HELP YOU? THAT'S BETTER. HE'S ONLY ASLEEP, MISS REYNOLDS. WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A STATE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION. BOB! [Franz] BE PATIENT. HE'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE. THIS FRESH AIR WILL REVIVE HIM IN NO TIME. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I ENJOY THESE LITTLE REUNIONS. [Franz] YOU FUNNY LITTLE PEOPLE. I WONDER WHY IT IS YOU ALWAYS HATE ME SO AT FIRST. I HAVEN'T REALLY HARMED YOU. [Franz] YOU GET THE BEST CARE. I NEVER LET YOU GET TOO WARM OR COLD, TOO HUNGRY OR TOO TIRED. YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL. THINK. NO DAILY GRIND, NO BUDGET PROBLEMS, NO TAXES OR DEBTS OR FAMILY TO SUPPORT. I SEE TO EVERYTHING. AND IT'S NEVER DULL. YOU SLEEP AWAY THE BORING HOURS IN YOUR JARS, AND WHEN I WAKE YOU, IT'S ONLY TO HAVE FUN. TO ENJOY SOME NEW TREAT I'VE THOUGHT UP FOR YOU. [Franz] DON'T YOU SEE HOW FORTUNATE YOU ARE? YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO ALL THE REST OF YOUR LITTLE LIVES BUT BE HAPPY. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK! CHANGE US BACK THE WAY WE WERE! I LIKE YOU BETTER THE WAY YOU ARE. ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP US THIS SIZE? ALWAYS. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO US? WOULD YOU REALLY LIKE TO KNOW? IT'S MY SECRET, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL GIVE ME AWAY. IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPLE, REALLY. NOTICE HOW THIS SLIDE PROJECTOR THROWS A VISUAL IMAGE. I CAN MAKE IT ANY SIZE I CHOOSE. WHEN I PUSH IT CLOSER TO THE WALL, THE PICTURE BECOMES SMALLER. [Franz] BEING OF AN INQUIRING MIND, I ASKED MYSELF ONE DAY IF I COULDN'T DO THE SAME WITH LIVING THINGS. I REASONED THAT IF I COULD PASS THEM THROUGH A DEVICE SIMILAR IN PRINCIPLE TO THIS SLIDE PROJECTOR THEN I WOULD BE ABLE TO PROJECT THESE LIVING THINGS TO ANY SIZE THAT I WOULD CHOOSE. THIS IS THE ANSWER I FOUND. HERE, TOMMY. TOMMY, TOMMY, TOMMY. TO PROJECT A COMPLEX MOLECULAR STRUCTURE SUCH AS A MAN OR A CAT, IT'S ONLY NECESSARY TO CHANGE THEM INTO ENERGY FIRST. MUCH AS THE LIGHT IN THAT SLIDE PROJECTOR. I SOON FOUND OUT THAT THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY TO CAUSE THIS CHANGE WAS TO BREAK DOWN THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE BY MEANS OF HIGH-FREQUENCY VIBRATION. NOW, WITH THIS TUNING FORK, I WILL SET UP A SONIC VIBRATION. JUST AS THE GLASS DISINTEGRATED THROUGH THE RESONANT FREQUENCY SENT OUT BY THIS TUNING FORK, SO WILL A LIVING THING DISINTEGRATE TO ITS RESONANT FREQUENCY. OF COURSE, IT'S A MUCH HIGHER FREQUENCY. THERE YOU ARE, TOMMY. NOW, WATCH THIS. ALL RIGHT, KITTY. I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. [Intense, high-pitched drone] NOW, WATCH THE CAT. YOU REMEMBER TOMMY, MISS REYNOLDS. [Franz] HE ALWAYS LIKED YOU. TAKE HIM. BEING SO SMALL, HE MAY FEEL STRANGE AT FIRST. [Franz] PET HIM. I MUST GET SOME OF THE OTHER LITTLE PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITH ME. I WANT THEM TO MEET YOU. HELLO, BIG BOY. WHO'S YOUR FRIEND? [Franz] MISS REYNOLDS, MAY I INTRODUCE MISS LANE? CALL ME GEORGIA. THEY ALL DO. GLAD TO MEET YOU, SALLY. WELCOME TO THE TOY DEPARTMENT. [Laurie] HI, KIDS. THIS IS LAURIE. SHE'S A SWELL KID. LAURIE MEET BOB AND SALLY. HOW ARE YOU? HELLO. GOSH, I'M AWFULLY SLEEPY. HOW LONG DID HE PUT ME AWAY THIS TIME? FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, ANYHOW. [Georgia] YOU MISSED A LOT OF FUN: A PICNIC IN A FLOWER BOX, DANCES, AND A MOONLIGHT SWIMMING PARTY IN THE SINK. ALL BECAUSE I WOULDN'T SING FOR HIM. HI, LAURIE. LONG TIME, NO SEE. HI, EVERYBODY. WELL, HI, STAN. SAY HELLO TO BOB AND SALLY. [Georgia] AND IF IT ISN'T MAC! PRIDE OF THE MARINE CORPS. MEET BOB AND SALLY. WELL, WELCOME, STRANGER. THE OLD FRANZ IS LEARNING HOW TO PICK 'EM BETTER ALL THE TIME. WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET THIS PARTY ROLLING? [Georgia] YEAH, LET'S GO! WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? WE GOT A NEW ARRIVAL HERE TO CELEBRATE. I HAVE SOME REFRESHMENTS FOR OUR LITTLE PARTY. A PETIT FOUR. A KNIFE TO CUT IT WITH. SOME TINY LITTLE CUPS AND SAUCERS. AND A MINIATURE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE. [Franz] PLEASE HELP YOURSELVES. I'M AFRAID I'M A LITTLE TOO CLUMSY TO SERVE MY GUESTS WHEN THEY'RE AS SMALL AS YOU. [Georgia] OH, BOY. GREAT! [Mac] THIS IS FOR YOU. A TOAST TO THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY, SALLY AND BOB. [Laurie] ARE YOU TWO ENGAGED? SAY, WHEN'S THE WEDDING GOING TO BE? YOU'D BETTER ASK HIM. POOR BOB AND SALLY. [Franz] THERE'S NO ONE YOUR SIZE WHO CAN MARRY YOU. I'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT IT, SOMETIME. STOP! ALL OF YOU STOP! HOW CAN YOU BE SO CALM? CALL FOR HELP, RUN, DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING BUT THIS! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER, ANYWAY? I GOT USED TO THIS SIZE IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES. BELIEVE ME, BROTHER, I KIND OF LIKE IT. I AIN'T NEVER HAD IT SO EASY IN MY LIFE. LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. WE'RE IN A JAM, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT FOR THE TIME BEING. I KNOW HOW SHE FEELS. I TOOK IT PRETTY HARD, TOO. BUT WE SOMETIMES HAVE TO DO THINGS WE DON'T WANT JUST TO HAVE SOME FREEDOM LIKE THIS. LISTEN, HE DROPS A CAPSULE IN YOUR JARS TO PUT YOU TO SLEEP. [Mac] DON'T BREATHE ANY OF IT. [Stan] PIPE DOWN, HE'S COMING BACK. COME ON, BABY, LET'S GO. [Mac] ROCK IT! NOW, LAURIE, YOU MUST SING FOR US. NO. I DON'T WANT TO SING. [Franz] BUT YOU WILL, MY DEAR, OR BACK IN THE BOTTLE YOU GO. YOU'RE A DOLLY, YOU'RE A DOLLY YOU'RE SO CUTE AND LOVELY, DEAREST LITTLE DOLL SAY YOU WANT ME TO BE NEAR YOU TO BE YOURS FOREVER MORE, MY LITTLE DOLL YOU'RE SO PRECIOUS, YOU'RE SO DARLING YOU'RE ALL THAT I COULD WANT, A LIVING DOLL NEVER LEAVE ME, DON'T DECEIVE ME STAY WITH ME FOREVER MORE, MY LIVING DOLL NEVER LEAVE ME, DON'T DECEIVE ME [Doorbell rings] STAY WITH ME FOREVER MORE, MY LIVING DOLL [Knock on door] YES? I WAS PASSING BY AND SAW THE LIGHT IN YOUR WINDOW. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE LONESOME, SO I DROPPED IN. YOU MIND? THAT WAS KIND OF YOU, EMIL. HOW DID YOUR OPENING NIGHT GO? WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. COME AND SIT DOWN AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT. LET ME PUT THINGS AWAY, HUH? BUT IT WILL ONLY TAKE ONE MINUTE. YOU MUST HEAR WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. COME. SIT DOWN. FIRST OF ALL, EVERYBODY WAS THERE. BUT EVERYBODY! HE'S GOT SOMEBODY OUTSIDE. THE TELEPHONE. THE POLICE. DOES ANYBODY KNOW THEIR NUMBER? I SHOULD REMEMBER. I CALLED THEM JUST YESTERDAY. [Bob] HURRY UP. POLICE DEPARTMENT. POLICE DEPARTMENT! WE'RE AT DOLLS INCORPORATED! FIFTH FLOOR OF THE TILFORD BUILDING! PLEASE HURRY! POLICE DEPARTMENT! ANYBODY ON THIS LINE? HE CAN'T HEAR ME. IT'S THE MUSIC. BUT IF WE STOP IT, FRANZ IS SURE TO COME BACK. TILFORD BUILDING! FIFTH FLOOR! DOLLS INCORPORATED! ANYBODY ON THIS LINE? HELP! HELP! HELP! WHAT'S THE USE? NOBODY CAN HEAR LITTLE PEOPLE LIKE US. ISN'T IT AWFUL TO THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL AROUND US, AND WE CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH TO THEM. AND THEN, RIGHT AFTER THE FIRST ACT, WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE CAME-- EMIL, I SIMPLY HAVE TO GO NOW. NOW WAIT A MINUTE, FRANZ. WAIT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO CAME BACKSTAGE TO CONGRATULATE ME. JUST A MINUTE. I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE RECORD PLAYER. THERE, YOU SEE. THE RECORD PLAYER TAKES CARE OF ITSELF. COME ON, LET ME FINISH IT. FRANZ, LISTEN. I TELL YOU, IT WAS LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS IN BRUSSELS. NOW, WILL YOU GUESS THE NAME OF THE PARTY WHO CAME BACKSTAGE? TRY, TRY. I CAN'T GUESS. YOU TELL ME. [Bob] THE MACHINE. I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD GO THROUGH IT THE OTHER WAY AND COME OUT OUR RIGHT SIZE. HE SAID IT WORKS LIKE A PROJECTOR. I'LL BET I COULD FIGURE OUT THE CONTROLS. IT MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA TO FOOL WITH IT. YOU MIGHT GET KILLED. I DON'T CARE. I'M WILLING TO RISK IT. I AM, TOO. WHO WOULDN'T BE? WELL, ONE'S ENOUGH. IT ONLY TAKES ONE OF US TO GO FOR HELP. [Bob] SHALLWE TRY IT? [All] YEAH. HOLD IT, YOU'RE LIVING DOLLS, BUT I WAS ONE OF HIS FIRST PUPPETS. I DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE THE GUINEA PIG. OKAY? ALL RIGHT, MAC. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF I MAKE A MISTAKE. COME ON, LET'S GO. IF IT WORKS, YOU'LL NEED CLOTHES. I'M PRETTY SURE HE KEEPS OUR OLD ONES IN THAT CLOSET. [Stan] THAT'S RIGHT. I SAW HIM HANG MINE UP IN THERE. WELL, COME ON. LET'S GO. YOU THREE GIRLS BETTER STAY UP HERE. I'LL WORK THE CONTROLS. STAN, YOU GO TO THE DOOR AND KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR FRANZ. [Stan] JUST A MINUTE. [Bob] THERE YOU GO. COME ON, LET'S GO. [Intense, high-pitched drone] HOW SPLENDID FOR YOU. SO, I SAID TO MYSELF, I SAID, "AT LAST I'M BEING APPRECIATED." I COULD HAVE WEPT FOR HAPPINESS, FRANZ. AND I AM HAPPY FOR YOU. MAY I GO NOW? I SHOULDN'T DETAIN YOU LIKE THIS, SHOULD I? YOU GO ON AND... I HAVE TO BE ALONE IN THIS KIND OF WORK. YOU UNDERSTAND? [Stan] HOLD IT! WHY DON'T YOU GO AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND I'LL TALK TO YOU WHILE YOU WORK? NO, NO. I'D RATHER GIVE YOU MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION, OLD FRIEND. SO TELL ME, WHAT HAPPENED THEN? OKAY. WE'D BETTER GET BACK. WHAT ABOUT A NIGHTCAP WITH ME, HUH? I ONLY WISH I COULD. SO, LUNCH TOMORROW THEN, HUH? CERTAINLY. I'LL CALL FOR YOU ABOUT NOON. EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT. I SUPPOSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE FOR US TO SAY BUT GOODNIGHT, HUH? LET'S BE BOLD AND GET IT OVER WITH. GOODNIGHT. [Mac] COME ON, STAN. YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH FUN FOR TONIGHT. COME TO BED QUICKLY NOW. IT'S TIME. [Doorbell rings] COME IN. SERGEANT, HOW ARE YOU? FINE, MR. FRANZ. YOU DON'T MIND IF I GO ON WITH MY WORK, DO YOU? I'M SHORTHANDED AND I'VE FALLEN WAY BEHIND. I NOTICE YOU'RE ADVERTISING FOR ANOTHER SECRETARY. YES, IT'S QUITE A PROBLEM KEEPING HELP THESE DAYS. HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO LOSE SALLY REYNOLDS? SHE WENT TO ST. LOUIS, I BELIEVE. HER FIANCE LIVES THERE, YOU KNOW. WELL, I COULD HAVE SAVED HER THE TRIP. WHY? HAVE YOU NEWS OF HIM? WELL, HE DIDN'T SHOW UP AT HOME, AND WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO MORE SOME MORE CHECKING ON HIM HERE. HOW STRANGE. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE COULD HAVE BECOME OF HIM? WELL, THAT'S WHA I CAME TO ASK YOU. [Doorbell rings] MISTER, CAN YOU FIX MY DOLLY? WILL YOU EXCUSE ME? TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMER. I'LL JUST LOOK AROUND. WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU. [Franz] TELL ME, WHAT'S YOUR DOLLY'S NAME? [Little Girl] SUSIE. SHE GOT RUN OVER. OH, DEAR, DEAR. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? SHE RAN OUT IN THE STREET WHILE I WASN'T LOOKING. THAT WASN'T NICE OF HER, WAS IT? SHE'S A BAD DOLLY. YOU KNOW, YOU OUGHT TO SPANK HER WHEN SHE DISOBEYS. I DO, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO DO ANY GOOD. ARE YOUR DOLLIES LIKE THAT? THEY DO GET RATHER HEADSTRONG SOMETIMES. [Sergeant] MR. FRANZ? WHAT'S IN HERE? [Franz] JUST A WORKROOM. WELL, MAY SEE IT, PLEASE? THERE'S NOTHING THERE THAT WOULD INTEREST YOU, SERGEANT. I GO THERE WHENEVER I'M LONELY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. MAY I HAVE THE KEY, PLEASE? THANK YOU. YOU HAVE SO MANY DOLLIES. THEY MUST GIVE YOU LOTS OF TROUBLE. YES, BUT THEY'RE NICE. I NEVER GET LONELY AND THAT MAKES UP FOR IT. [Little Girl] LOOK! ISN'T THAT CUTE? [Little Girl] CAN I HAVE IT? NO, DEAR. NO, NO. PLEASE. WHY NOT? EVERYBODY WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU GOT IT. YOU KNOW, GROWNUPS ASK SO MANY AWKWARD QUESTIONS. BETTER GIVE IT TO ME. DON'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME. I WANT IT. WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS THING IN HERE? YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT UNTIL I GET BACK. OH, THAT? WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO YOU? YOU GOT ME. YOU KNOW WHAT A PHOTOGRAPHIC ENLARGER IS, DON'T YOU? WELL, THIS WORKS JUST THE OPPOSITE. I USE IT TO MAKE MODELS OF PEOPLE. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE HOW IT WORKS? SOME OTHER TIME. I'VE GOT TO BE RUNNING ALONG. WHAT YOU GOT THERE, LITTLE GIRL? LET'S SEE. A TAPE RECORDING INSIDE. [Franz] DO YOU LIKE IT? [Little Girl] UH-HUH. CAN I HAVE IT? NO. BUT YOU CAN COME AND PLAY WITH IT ANYTIME YOU LIKE. AND THE CAT? YES. THAT, TOO. ABOUT THOSE MISSING PEOPLE, I'LL BE CHECKING WITH YOU LATER. I DO HOPE YOU FIND THEM SOON, SERGEANT. THANK YOU. BYE, HONEY. NOW, I'LL FIX YOUR DOLLY. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PUPPETS YOU EVER HAD, EMIL. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST JEKYLL AND HYDES THERE EVER WAS. IT WAS MADE BY SCHWARTZ, IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS IN PRAGUE. BUT A FUNNY THING, EVERY TIME THE CUE COMES FOR JEKYLL TO CHANGE INTO HYDE, NOTHING HAPPENS. DID YOU BRING ME BACK HERE AT THIS LATE HOUR BECAUSE YOUR STAR PUPPET WAS A LITTLE TEMPERAMENTAL? PLEASE, FRANZ. PLEASE UNDERSTAND MY PREDICAMENT. THERE ARE ONLY THREE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD I TRUST TO CURE HIM. MARIANI, WHO'S IN MILAN. AURIAC, BUT HE'S IN PARIS, AND YOU. YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL I NEVER COULD RESIST FLATTERY. HOW MUCH TIME CAN I HAVE TO WORK ON HIM? WELL, YOU SEE, WE HAVE A MATINEE TOMORROW AT 2:00. IT WOULD BE TRAGIC TO RETURN ALL THAT MONEY FOR THE TICKETS. CAN YOU HAVE HIM READY THAT SOON? I'LL TRY, EVEN IF IT TAKES ME ALL NIGHT. AND, ONE MORE THING, HOW MUCH IS THIS GONNA COST? NOTHING. THAT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO FOR AN OLD FRIEND. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MAY A DEAR OLD FRIEND ASK YOU SOMETHING OF A PERSONAL NATURE? CERTAINLY. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO THAT BRINGS THE POLICE OVER TO ASK ME ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS? WHEN WAS THIS? THIS AFTERNOON. A POLICE SERGEANT NAMED PATERSON. HE COMES TO MY HOTEL ROOM,AND IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC, HE ASKED ME IF YOU WERE IN THE HABIT OF MAKING PEOPLE DISAPPEAR. I SUPPOSE YOU TOLD HIM I DO IT ALL THE TIME? BUT SERIOUSLY, IT'S BAD BUSINESS TO HAVE POLICE PRYING INTO YOUR AFFAIRS. EMIL, I'M QUITE SERIOUS. IF I THOUGHT I WAS BEING WATCHED I WOULD FIND LIFE INTOLERABLE. NOW, BE A GOOD FELLOW, WILL YOU, AND TELL THE NIGHT DOORMAN TO LET ME IN THE THEATER LATER ON. I'LL HAVE TO GIVE MR. HYDE A TRYOUT WHEN HE'S FINISHED. I'LL RUN ALONG NOW. I'LL DO IT ON MY WAY HOME. I DON'T SUPPOSE I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO YOU, FRANZ. NONSENSE. GOOD NIGHT, EMIL. AND GOODBYE. [Franz] SORRY YOU'RE AWAKE, MISS REYNOLDS. MAKES EVERYTHING MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? THE POLICE HAVE BEEN ASKING MY FRIEND, EMIL, QUESTIONS. THEY'RE GETTING TOO CLOSE. THAT LEAVES ME ONLY ONE COURSE. YOU'LL FREE US, WON'T YOU? YOU'LL MAKE US OUR RIGHT SIZE AGAIN? [Franz] AND BE DEPRIVED OF YOUR COMPANY? NO, I COULDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. CAN'T YOU SEE? IT'S BETTER THAT WE ALL BOW OUT TOGETHER. [Franz] PLEASE, DON'T BE FRIGHTENED. CAN'T YOU SEE? IT'S MUCH BETTER THAT WE ALL MEET DEATH TOGETHER THAN FOR ANY ONE OF US TO BE LEFT ALONE. THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN LONELINESS. WAIT. WAIT, I HAVE A SPLENDID IDEA. YES, WE'LL HAVE A GOING-AWAY PARTY FOR ALL OF US. A CELEBRATION. EMIL ASKED ME TO FIX HIS PUPPET AND LEAVE IT AT THE THEATER. WE'LL HAVE OUR PARTY THERE. A THEATER PARTY. [Franz] NOW, LET'S ALL GET READY. SAY, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH BEING A BOTTLE BABY? LOOK AT THE SERVICE WE GET. THE OLD BOY IS REALLY LETTING GO. HE'S BEEN GIVING US PARTIES LIKE THEY'RE GOING OUT OF STYLE. AND TONIGHT, A THEATER PARTY NO LESS. YOU BETTER ENJOY IT, GEORGIA, AS IT MAY BE OUR LAST. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? SALLY! TELL HER. HE SAID THAT TONIGHT... HE SAID TONIGHT HE WAS TO KILL US ALL AND GOING HIMSELF, TOO. WE'D BETTER HURRY UP AND DRESS. WE'LL TELL THE BOYS. BOB, BOB, HE SAID HE'S GOING TO-- YEAH, I KNOW. WE HEARD YOU TELL GEORGIA. IF I WAS JUST MY OLD SIZE FOR FIVE MINUTES. LET'S TRY THE PHONE. THERE'S NO MUSIC NOW. MAYBE THEY'LL HEAR US. SURE. AND SO WOULD FRANZ. HE'S JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR. HEY, THE WINDOW. IT'S SLIGHTLY OPEN. MAYBE WE COULD SIGNAL SOMEBODY. SURE WE CAN. WE'RE ONLY FIVE STORIES UP. HERE'S SOME PAPER. GET SOMETHING TO WRITE WITH. LAURIE, KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR FRANZ. HERE'S AN OLD PAINTBRUSH. IT'S ALL DRIED UP. SAY, HOW ABOUT USING SOME OF THIS LIPSTICK? [Stan] HERE'S A PENCIL. [Bob] GREAT. BRING IT ON OVER. [Bob] LET'S SEE NOW. I'LL WRITE, "HELP! SEND POLICE!" [Georgia] YES. [Mac] COME ON [Georgia] HURRY UP. [Bob] GET THAT PENCIL OUT OF THE WAY. PUSH SOME OF THAT STUFF BACK. [Mac] AIM IT GOOD. NOW, SHALL WE TAKE A TAXI TO THE THEATER? I THINK THAT WOULD BE A NICE TREAT. OF COURSE, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE OUT THE WINDOW, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL MIND THAT LITTLE INCONVENIENCE. AT LEAST, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT THE CITY SOUNDS LIKE AT NIGHT BECAUSE THIS TIME, I SHAN'T PUT YOU TO SLEEP. [Franz] YOU'VE BEEN VERY GOOD. THIS IS YOUR REWARD. YOU ALL RIGHT, MR. FRANZ? YES, YES, FINE. [Janitor] KIND OF LONESOME IN A THEATER WITH NOBODY AROUND. NOT TO ME. I HAVE MY PUPPETS TO KEEP ME COMPANY. BUT YOU'VE BEEN AT IT ALL NIGHT. I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D GET YOU SOME MORE COFFEE. NO, NO MORE COFFEE. I STILL HAVE PLENTY. DON'T COME ON THE STAGE! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. NO MORE COFFEE. I'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE CAPSULES THAT HE USES TO PUT US TO SLEEP. IF WE COULD SLIP IT IN HIS COFFEE... IT MAY NOT PUT HIM TO SLEEP, BUT IT'D SLOW HIM DOWN SOME. [Mac] WHERE'D YOU GET IT? [Bob] THE LAST TIME HE PUT US AWAY. NOW THEN, I THINK OUR PUPPET FRIEND DR. JEKYLL IS READY FOR A TRIAL. GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM DR. JEKYLL. I HAVE DISCOVERED A STRANGE DRUG. IT IS ABLE TO FREE MY EVIL NATURE FROM WHAT IS GOOD IN ME. [Franz as Jekyll] THEN I BECOME THE SINISTER MONSTER, MR. HYDE. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A FEW MEMBERS OF OUR AUDIENCE, I'D LIKE TO PUT ON ONE OF THE SCENES FROM OUR LITTLE PLAY. [Franz as Jekyll] WHICH ONE OF YOU WILL VOLUNTEER? COME NOW, WE MUSTN'T KEEP DR. JEKYLL WAITING. [Franz] MISS REYNOLDS, YOU WILL PLAY THE GOOD DOCTOR'S FIANCE. GEORGIA, YOU WILL BE HIS VICTIM. AND, NOW LET ME SEE, FOR DR. JEKYLL'S BEST FRIEND... YES, BOB, YOU SHOULD BE VERY GOOD IN THE PART. THE REST OF YOU JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY YOURSELVES. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ON, MISS REYNOLDS. I'LL PROMPT YOU ON WHAT TO DO. GO AHEAD, DARLING. KEEP HIS EYES OFF THE COFFEE CUP. TELL HIM HE'S BEEN STRANGE LATELY AND ASK HIM WHAT'S THE MATTER. YOU'VE BEEN STRANGE LATELY. TELL ME WHAT'S THE MATTER. NOTHING, MY DEAR. NOTHING AT ALL. IT'S ONLY YOUR IMAGINATION. YOU MUST PLAY UP TO HIM. REMEMBER, YOU LOVE HIM. SAY SO. TELL HIM HE CAN TRUST YOU. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU. WHY CAN'T YOU BE KIND TO ME? NO. MORE CONVINCING, DEAR. TRY IT AGAIN. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU. WHY CAN'T YOU BE KIND TO ME? THAT'S IT, MY DEAR. THAT'S IT. [Franz as Jekyll] THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. THEY CAN NEVER BE CHANGED BACK AGAIN. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE STOPPED SEEING ONE ANOTHER. THERE IS DANGER HERE FOR YOU AND I WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO YOU. ASK HIM TO CONFIDE IN YOU. WHY WON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG? I HAVE TRAVELED THE ROAD OF NO RETURN. THERE IS NO GOING BACK. ONLY DEATH CAN FREE ME FROM THE CURSE I HAVE PUT UPON MYSELF. [Sally screams] WHY YOU'RE MORE OF A FIEND THAN I THOUGHT! IF YOU'RE GONNA KILL US, GET IT OVER WITH! CUT OUT THIS CAT-AND-MOUSE GAME! BOB, DON'T RUIN OUR LAST ACT. LOOK AT THIS PUPPET DOWN HERE, FRANZ. LOOK AT IT CLOSELY! IT'S A MONSTER ALL RIGHT, BUT NOT HALF THE MONSTER YOU ARE! STOP IT, BOB! THE PUPPET! YOU'RE DESTROYING THE PUPPET! STOP IT, I TELL YOU! STOP IT! [Sally screams] WHO'S THERE? ME AGAIN. DON'T COME ON THE STAGE! I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT TO BE DISTURBED. I HEARD YOU SHOUTING AND I THOUGHT-- YOU THOUGHT WHAT? MAYBE YOU WANT SOME MORE COFFEE. NO, NO, YOUR COFFEE'S FINE AND STILL HAVE PLENTY. BOB! MISS REYNOLDS! WHERE HAVE YOU RUN TO? WHERE ARE YOU HIDING? WHERE ARE YOU? DON'T RUN AWAY FROM ME! COME, IT'S TIME FOR US TO GO! WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO, ANYWAY? HAVEN'T YOU HEARD A VENTRILOQUIST PRACTICE THROWING HIS VOICE? [Georgia] HELP! WE'RE HERE. [Laurie] STOP HIM! HELP! I'VE HEARD ABOUT ENOUGH. THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY NEARBY! IT'S 5:30 IN THE MORNING. MOST PEOPLE ARE IN BED NOW. IT'S HOPELESS! LET'S GET TO FRANZ'S AND THE MACHINE. IF WE MAKE IT, WE'LL COME BACK FOR THE OTHERS. IT'S THIS WAY. SECOND AND MAIN. AND WE HAVE TO GO TO SEVENTH AND HILL. HOW FAR IS IT? ABOUT A MILE,I THINK. WHEN WE'RE OUR SIZE, THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF 6 MILES. HOW CAN WE MAKE IT, BOB? WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT STANDING HERE. COME ON. WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? DID YOU SEE THEM LEAVE? THEM? WHO? NEVER MIND. ARE YOU SURE IT'S THIS WAY? I THINK SO. I WAS ALMOST SURE THAT IT WAS. WAIT, BOB. LOOK, IT'S THE FACTORY. COME ON, LET'S HURRY. WE HAVE TO GO TO THE FIFTH FLOOR. THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR WON'T BE ON FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR. WE CAN'T OPERATE IT OURSELVES. WHAT ABOUTFREIGHT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, THERE MUST BE A FREIGHT ELEVATOR AROUND BACK. WHEN DO THEY MAKE DELIVERIES? I DON'T KNOW. SHIPMENTS USUALLY COME IN BEFORE I GET TO WORK. COME ON. [Bob] HEY, WAIT! IT'S ALL RIGHT. HE'LL BE BACK FOR ANOTHER LOAD IN A MINUTE. BOB, LOOK! BOB, LOOK, THE LABEL! IT'S FOR MR. FRANZ. GO ON, GET OUT! DOLLS INCORPORATED WE'RE IN LUCK. HE LEFT THE DOORS OPEN. [Sound of key in the door] [Little Girl] MR. FRANZ! MR. FRANZ! WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY? ISN'T MR. FRANZ IN? LET ME TRY. [Sergeant] WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH MISSED HIM, DOESN'T IT? YOU LIKE HIM, DON'T YOU? BECAUSE HE MAKES DOLLIES? [Little Girl] AND PEOPLE, TOO. PEOPLE? LITTLE PEOPLE. HE MAKES LITTLE PEOPLE, DOES HE? HOW? OUT OF BIG ONES WITH A MACHINE. REAL LITTLE PEOPLE? PEOPLE THAT WALK AND TALK AND EVERYTHING? HOW DO YOU KNOW? MR. FRANZ SHOWED ME. HE SAID, SOMETIMES WHEN I'M GOOD I CAN PLAY WITH THEM. [Sergeant] HE ISN'T HERE TO LET YOU PLAY WITH THEM, AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE UNHAPPY? [Little Girl] HE SAID I COULD PLAY WITH HIS KITTY. [Sergeant] OH, A KITTY? [Little Girl] A LITTLE, TINY KITTY. MR. FRANZ KEEPS IT IN A MATCHBOX. HE MADE IT IN HIS MACHINE. [Sergeant] I SEE. ISN'T IT TIME YOU WERE GOING TO SCHOOL? WELL, COME ON. I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THERE. LITTLE PEOPLE. CAT IN A MATCHBOX. COME ON. [Bob] GET AWAY FROM THAT DOOR. COME ON, SALLY. WE'LL CALL THE POLICE. DON'T LEAVE ME. PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME. DON'T LEAVE ME! I'LL BE ALONE. THE END
