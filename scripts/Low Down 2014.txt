Squeaking bedsprings, buzzing flies, dripping faucets were all filled with rhythm to him. That he was "a great jazz pianist" was the opinion of Charlie Parker, Lester Young, and scores of others who played with him. I, too, was in awe of his talent. But I loved him out of all proportion... as only a daughter could. One more time. Motherfucker. Hey, Hobbs, maybe not the fifth... that last note? - Try sharp eleventh. - Yeah. - That's the Monk note, man. - That's right. Yeah, man. - What'd you think of that? - I loved that one. The circular spherical midnight? Mm-hmm. I think it felt good. - Yeah? Yeah. Maybe something a little bit more danceable? Whoop. Hey. Push the button, mutton. Ah. My lady. Kind sir. - Hey, where are you goin'? - That thing's too slow. You're fast on your feet, "Vargas. " Dance lessons have paid off handsomely. Grab those rabbit ears, too. Why don't you, uh, put on some coffee? You want a cup of coffee? I'm good. Joe Albany, we had an appointment scheduled in my office three days ago. Did you forget to mark it down on your calendar? I'm sincerely sorry about that. You see, I took a job down in Palm Springs... very nice place, legit, a lot of film people. Mm, one of the terms of your parole, Joe, is that you call me. You inform me of any work that you procure. Do you have any record of this employment? Uh, it was a cash job. Unfortunately, I don't have much left. I owed a few people some money. I... I got the TV out of hock for my kid and so... Mm. I don't like having to leave my office, Joe. I have a new air cooler that I enjoy very much, and I don't like this town. So I don't care to travel the streets of this town and track down people who are not considerate of my valuable time. You must turn up on time. No excuses will be accepted. - Is that clear to you? - Yes, perfectly. Should it be necessary for me to return here, you will be returned to the penitentiary. Is that also clear to you, Joe? - Yes, sir. - Right. Now please, roll up your sleeves. Other arm. Nothing fresh. I've been clean. And that will be $3.55. Hey, champ. You got any money on you? What? Is that a joke? Okay, okay. I know you. Pay later. Okay? Are you sure? I... I know you. Pay later. See? Our luck is changing. You brought her back. She'll live and I'll get her another body. Let me die. Ugh! Hey, listen to this one. "Due to your melodic nature, moonlight never misses an appointment. " What? Let me see that. Wow. That's poetry. I'm gonna keep this one. I can't take this any longer. Oh, it's "Night of the Living Dead. " Mm. That's a good one. You have to shoot him in the brain. It's the only way to kill him. Oh, good. Thanks for that info. Who is it? Hey, it's Lew. Hey, Joe. I was just walkin' along, noticed you were home. Thought I'd come up, say hi. You think I'd be okay if I just came in and rested for a few? No. I'm here with my daughter. Listen, here's the story. - Keep it down. - Shh. - Keep your voice down. - Okay, I'm sorry. So here's the story. I just copped and... I ain't feelin' so good out here. Fuck you showin' up here. Aw, man, come on. I'll just be in and right out. No. Got a little taste for you. You think I give a shit? There ain't nobody that followed me. Just wait there. The whole story becomes more ghastly with each performance. Difficult to imagine such a thing actually happening... He's just gonna use the bathroom for a second. Come on. - Oh, thank you, man. Hurry up. Go on. You better not make a fuckin' mess in there. Wake up, Jo. Time for school. It's the weekend. Yeah. It is, isn't it? That's great news. That's the best news. We'll go do something fun later. - ... to renovate the - Hollywood sign, and guess who's gotten into the act? Well, Alice Cooper. The Hollywood sign is a rebel, I mean, a nightmare. And that's just like his lifestyle. - Hey, Jo. - I'm cleaning my lifestyle, and I wanna clean the sign up. It should be Hollywood, not "Hollyweird"... I have a big surprise for you. Oh, but you have to remember one thing... Ta-da! Really are as skinny as a little stray kitten, Amy-Jo. You must eat. "Amy-Jo. " I never call her that. You should. I named you after my two favorite sisters in "Little Women. " Amy, pretty and self-possessed, and Jo, the independent tomboy. Yeah. I know that. Well, you seem to have the tomboy part down. I think she's got the pretty part down, too. Guess what, Jo? Your mom wants to start singing again. We can try to work together like in the days of old. I thought you didn't like working with singers. I don't recall saying that. Well, I for one will be honored to have a collaborator as brilliant as your father. Think it calls for a toast, don't you? "If music be the fruit of love, play on. " Beautiful. Amy-Jo. - Not here. - Why? We can go somewhere else. It's a pity your dad has to work in a glorified pizza parlor. I think it's great. Right on. Thank you, Billy Strayhorn. That was a tune he wrote, called "Lush Life. " I hope I did it justice. We'll take a short break now. Joe? Joe. You were great. Come sit with me. Joe, my man. - One second, man. Joe... Nice work. - We enjoyed it. - How're you doin'? Well, this has become a crashing bore. I'm getting out of here. Why don't you go over there and sit with the boys' club? Just... listen. - Mom, it's okay. - You're right. I'm okay. Amy-Jo...! Porter? Porter? There any messages... - Hey, hey. - What're you doin'? What hap... hey, Sheila. Amy... your mom... ah, so you know. "I wanna hold your claw. " Ha. That's right. It's Valentine's Day, isn't it? Yep. Let me make you breakfast. We only have two eggs. I'll run to the shop. - Only one egg. - Oh, well. I'll be back in a flash with the hash. Corned beef hash, that is. "Today... is named after a saint... who got his head chopped off... for performing weddings. Ouch. " "Happy Valentine's Day, Dad. " Hello, Joe! - Hello? - Gram? Amy, is everything all right? No. What's going on? Is your father there? No. Well, where is he? Oh-hh. I hear you wheezing. Your chest hurt? Yeah. - All right, now. Okay, I want you to sit over there. All right, you just sit down. Sweetie, I'll get you some water. - There you go. - Thank you. Too bad the chauffeur had a day off. Oh. There is a book... that I have been thinking you would enjoy. Here it is. Now, you've got to trust me on this. I know you like it. It's Dylan Thomas. I want you to read that. Dylan Thomas was 15 years old when he left school. So you have two years to become a writer as good as Dylan Thomas. Yeah, there's plenty of room in here for all your things. Mm. I'll see what I have in the refrigerator. Noodles and gravy? - Third title defense in - New Orleans for the champion. With a minute to go in the 10th round, The place is beginning to warm up to the action. Two good punches by the champ. Two left-hand leads by Johnson. Both those shots blocked. And it's good the right hand was, because it was whistling. How can you believe in all those things? Because as Charlie Chaplin said, "I am a citizen of the world. " Johnson on the left, six years younger at 25. pinpoint punching... with even left-hand leads. The referee Jesus Selas... a staggering left-hand lead! And it jarred the champion. Hello, sweetness. It's so good to see you. Are you coming home soon? No, I live in hope. Hey. Sit here. Look at that. Thanks, Mom. You look all in. I'm doin' all right. Much better now that I can finally see my girls. The bureaucracy is inhuman. What about you, monkeyshines? Life treating you all right? Yeah. I hate school. You and me both. Have you had a chance to play at all? Yeah. There's a piano in the chapel I can sign up for. I can imagine it's ghastly out of tune. I've played worse. Hey, I got you some change for those nutty vending machines. Marquez, 3-7-9-1. - Dr. Huerta to the dispensary. - Dr. Huerta. I need your help. I need you to go see my P.O. All right. What exactly do you want me to ask him? I just need you to ask him what the hell's going on. I was sent here pending review to get clean. Okay, great. Tell him I'm clean. What the hell is wrong with you, Joe? You only had six months left on your parole. I know. Thank God they put you here and not back in prison. Yeah, well, it ain't prison, but they still won't let me leave. I mean, why the hell did they pick me up for marks anyway? That's the wrong question. Why do you have them? I'm crawling out of my skin. Oh, hey. There she is, folks. The queen of the rodeo. Her arms overflowing with riches. Thanks. Mmm. Albany, 3-4-1-7-7. Well... lovelies, that's my cue. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, love. See you soon, I hope. Yeah. Take your cigarettes. That's what I came for. - Bye. - Yeah. John Dean finished his testimony before the Senate Watergate committee today. - The interrogation of Dean... You can't help yourself if you can't think straight. You've got to feed the mind. Look at you go. You eat like a linebacker. I love it. You know, you feed the body, you feed the spirit. You want a tomato? - Sure. - Here you are. My neighbor up the street grows these. - Nice and fresh. - Do you want bread? No, thank you. Not right now. So tomorrow we'll go and get your father. I don't know why he does stuff like that. I just don't know. I don't understand. I'm glad you're here. Hmm? I'm gonna feed you up. Yeah, you'll be a little fat thing in a couple of weeks. Here we are. Good luck, Joe. Keep playing it clean. Joe. Wow. It's a... it's a... A handcrafted shoe polisher. I thought you could use a new one. Oh, fantastic. Wow. You know... I dreamt about this food in there, Ma. What a waste of a dream. Wasted dreams. Wasted dreams. Mine is a life strewn with wasted dreams. Speaking of which, how much back rent do I owe on this palace? - Two weeks. I paid one. - Shouldn't have bothered. We could have always gotten another room. - You should've just boxed up my stuff. - Hey, just a minute. What kind of idea is that? Your daughter can't live out of a box. Joe, you do understand that one of the terms of your probation is to establish permanent residence? Yeah, yeah. Where's my fucking wallet? - Joe? - I'm goin' out. Why won't you just sit down and relax, all right? - All right, you can't go out. - Jesus Christ. - Have a ginger ale. - I don't want any fuckin' ginger ale! I'm almost out of smokes. I need to fuckin'... Don't you ever get tired of lying? Yeah, well, we know you're no fuckin' saint yourself. No, I'm not a saint, but I suffer like a saint with you for a son. - Ma, get the hell outta my way. - What are you gonna do, knock me down? - Let's all sit. - It's almost ready. If you don't fucking move on your own, - I will move you. - Cut it out, Dad! - Move. - Why don't you just kill me? Put me out of this misery. There's a knife on that table. Do me a big favor. Yeah? Don't put ideas in my head. You get away from her, you asshole! I hate you! Don't you ever talk to your father that way again. Look at the sadness it causes. Where's my goddamn wallet, huh? - Behind you. What is wrong with you? Every single night you get... Hey. Stay close, okay? Okay. Hey, LaPrez. - Is this your train? - Yeah. I like it. - A little rusty, though - Yeah. - I need to wash it off. - Mm-hmm. But then it's going to get more rusty, yeah, 'cause it's metal. Is that it? Is that it? Yeah. It looks like... sort of like a... a lamp to me. It's fantastic. I love it. You sure? - Yes. How much can you do with it on? Is it gonna stay on? It stays on. There's like a... there's a base thing. It hurts, though. - We've got to file out some of this. - Okay, okay. I love it. You're gonna get reimbursed. I have to go. I'm late. All right, see ya. Hi. Hi. What are you guys watching? - Do you have a lot of homework? - No, it's Friday. Oh, yeah. I always forget that. Oh, I got you this. Thanks. I'll save it for dessert. Hey. - Did I hit you? - No. I'll live. What was that anyway? - Licorice. - Oh? Then it's completely understandable. - It's good, right? - What's that? It's good. The music. Yeah. It's really beautiful. It's my dad. Really? Joe is your dad? Yeah. Wow. It was nice to meet you. See you later. Hey there, kid, glad you made it. I read some Vishnu. - Who's Vishnu? - Evidently a Thai writer. Read this. Read this before Vishnu. Bravo! Bravo, Maestro. Hey. What shall I play next, Fun Bun? Um... "Over the Rainbow"? - Hey there, Peanut. - Hey. Sorry I didn't meet up to walk home with you. It's not like I need you to. Oh, I know that, but I like to. - I didn't hang you up, did I? - No. Where are you going? Me? I'm not going anywhere. - Why the cologne? - Jeez, can't a guy smell good? Hey, listen. Why don't you and your little friend check out what movies are playing down at the Vine? - Wait. What little friend? - LaPrez. It's still 99 cents there, right? - Yeah. - Okay. There we go. Here. Hang on. I know I had another buck around here somewhere. Ah. Here we go. Great. Here you go. Popcorn. Okay. Hey, be back before dark and don't talk to any creeps. Go on now. You're still here. I live here. Really? Where? Uh. Right down here. No one's supposed to actually live here, so I get it for pretty cheap. Just watch your head. I'll get the light. Whoops. I'm sorry. This is the bathroom. - Thank you. - Dry yourself... you'll catch a cold. That's, uh, that. Watch these stairs here. - I can't believe it's here. - Yeah. Here it is. I also have my own private entranceway to the alley. Some light. Ahem. - It's so cool. - Yeah? I just... - Does it work? - just fixed it, actually. Let me play something I think you'll... think you'll like. Uh, there it is. She sounds like a bird. I like it. Good choice. Well, I guess I better go check in on my dad now. Yeah, okay. I'll show you out. I don't want you to get lost. Yeah. It was awfully nice that, uh, you visiting me. Don't forget to watch your head. Bye. Amy. Did you see these records I brought over? Check 'em out. Eric Dolphy. Booker Little, he's my favorite. He died so young. Clifford Brown was his favorite and he died young, too. Crazy. It's like God wants to take these guys 'cause they're so good. Yeah. This'll do nicely. - You know this one? - Mm-mm. You're gonna dig it. I assure you of that, young lady. You are in for the truth. Yeah. Excuse me. Hey, man... I got what we want right here. You think she's gonna go to sleep soon? I live in hope. - I'm gonna go to bed now. Oh, okay. - Good night, love. - Good night. Sweet dreams. Is it cool? Alain, are you ready?! The girls are good to go! Yeah. I'll be in in a minute. Gotta go, gotta go. Okay, just back up just a little bit. Okay... right up here. Okay, ladies. Wait here one second. Cowboys, come with me. Come with me. Okay, right here by this tumbleweed. Alain, on your mark, please. Here we go, right over here. Okay, could we get this light over? Be right on him. Can we get that red gel here? Now, headdress on. Please be careful. Could we get him the, uh, thing? Yeah, right there. Good. Hang on... "Cowboys and Indians," take one. Mark it. Oh, that's great. You look so beautiful. Okay, take out your guns. Yeah, "pow, pow. " Help yourself down... Very good, gentlemen. Spin those guns. Okay, you see him. Now, take your time. That's good. Okay, kneel down... okay, now kiss him. - All right. - Good. Hold it right there. Take his cock in your hands. And now put it in your mouth. Ow! Cut! What the fuck? - Out of my way. - Hey, there she is... Back to one. Psst, Joe? Yeah? I just let your P.O. into your room. You might want to take the kid out for a while. Ah... yeah. Yeah. Hey, Jo, what do you say we go for a walk? I'm all right, Grandma. I'm... Dad? - Dad? - Yeah. Do you think we can go back yet? Did you finish your homework? I finished an hour ago. Come on. Thank Christ he didn't find this. What is that? Are you going somewhere? Yeah, I was... I was lookin' for the right time to tell you. Um... I need to leave for a while, Jo. Why? A lot of reasons. I... I can't keep myself straight here. You understand? If I stay here, I'll never get better. And I know a lot of cats workin' in Europe. I could... I could play there and make some money. But here... here, nobody seems to care about the music. - I care. - I know. And you're my number one fan. But... Christ, I don't even have a fucking piano here, Jo. What about your probation? Well, I... I figure if they find out I left because I was tryin' to do somethin'... to accomplish something... creatively, well, I mean, you'd have to be a real crumb - not to back that up. - Okay. Can I come with you? Yes, soon. I just need to get a little money together. Then I'll send for you, I promise. Come on, Joe. No tears. You'll get to hang out with Gram for a while. Say something. Please? Nothing I say is gonna make any difference, is it? Hey. I need help with my mother. You do? What's goin' on with her? Uh, take LaPrez to the lobby and wait for me there, okay? Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Many years ago, the public opinion polls in this country showed a trend away from organized religion, but now the polls indicate that trend is bottoming out. And these days there seems to be a revival of that old-time religion. I've decided to give you twice as much for it. No, no, no. I want my Tide. LaPrez? Yes? It's time for you to say goodbye to your friend and come with me. Hold on. What's happening here? Are you a relative of the boy's? No, but, I... Well, I'm with Child Welfare Services. Please let me do my job. Please come with me, dear. Fuck. - Hello? Joe Albany on the line. Do you accept the charges? Yeah, yeah. No, no, I accept charges. Thank you. Hello, Mom? Can you hear me? Did I wake you? Joe, I hear you. It's 3:00 in the morning. What's going on? I got big news. I'm coming home. Why? Is-is... is everything all right? Sure. Everything's fine, Ma. So when will you be here? Uh, my flight gets in around 3:30. 3:30 when? - At 3:30 this afternoon. - This afternoon? Yep. Listen, I gotta run. Kiss to Amy. Joe? Joe? Your father seems to be coming home. Wow. It's really... news. - I need some coffee. - I'll have some, too. No, no, no. You should go back to sleep. Nah. The sun will be up in a couple hours... might as well see it. Oh, how are you? You look good. Look at you, Jo. You're so beautiful. I'm speechless. Amy, go get your father a nice cold glass - of ginger ale. - Ah, yeah. And maybe some of those little tarts that we made... if we have any left over. I can't remember. So, where is my bunk in this tiny slice of heaven? You could... you could sleep there in Amy's bed. Amy can take the daybed and I can be on the sofa. Okay, great. That's okay? Yeah. Thanks, Joe. Dad, you want me to put your stuff in there? Mm-hmm. Thanks. - Is that all you have? - I'm traveling light. - Joe? Joe? - Yeah? You're playing with dynamite coming back here. How... how long are you planning on staying? What, are you trying to get rid of me already? No, but, Joe... you skipped out on your parole. You could go back to prison. Yeah, yeah. Hey, listen. I have something for you, dear lady. My advance on a recording I made in Paris. - Here. - Oh, thank you, Joe, but I... I can't... I can't take that. No, please. I'm happy to do it. Besides... I wanna know it's in good hands. Well, if only for the safekeeping. Hey. I see I made it onto your wall of fame. Ha, ha! Yeah. Yeah. Oh, check this out. Dsseldorf. It's a swinging little town. I gotta take you there someday. Hmm? Ah, this is cozy. Is that the lucky fella I've heard tell about? Yep. That's him. - Cory, huh? - Cole. Cole. That's right. Good-looking kid. He's a lucky guy. Whew. I went to a lot of fancy restaurants over there, but nothin' came close to your cookin', Ma. That doesn't surprise me. Hey, get your elbow off the table. - Cole plays the drums. - Oh, yeah? I'm in this band. We're just rehearsing, trying to get something going, you know? I mean, I understand if you're busy and whatnot, but we'd be honored if you could come by sometime and share your musical wisdom with us. Maybe. Uh, sure. I don't know about wisdom, though. - Hey, hey. - Hey. Looks like I'm interrupting your supper. Ah, what are you talking about? Get over here. Hey, Joe. Welcome home, buddy. - Far out, man. - Yeah, come on in. How are you keeping yourself, Hobbs? Can I make you a plate? Are you hungry? - Did you have dinner? - Oh, no, thank you. Hobbs, this is Amy's fella Cole. - Nice to know you, Cole. - Hi. So, Cole, you weren't by any chance named after the great Cole Porter? No, I was born around Christmas... so they called me Cole. Who's Cole Porter? Amy, who's Cole Porter? Is that some kind of joke or something? You think I've gone stupid while you were gone? Never. He's one of our greatest American composers. You'd dig him, I'm sure. I'd love to hear it sometime. Did you take your medication? - No, I did not. - Thank you. He has to take an anticonvulsant. Oh. - You have epilepsy? - Yeah, but it's not so bad anymore. I was really lucky. I got, you know, on the first nine-week trial ever. "Klonopin. " Hmm. I heard about this in the UK. I never heard of it. Have you always had seizures? Not until my stepdad started knocking my head against the wall. Ah. I'm sorry to hear. That's life. Gram's trying to get Cole to try some natural alternatives. I certainly am. The Chinese have been studying the human body for centuries. She found out about this healing martial art called "chi kung. " It's pretty cool. It's a lot of breathing and movement, meditation... that kind of thing. Oh, yeah? Let's see some moves. Yeah. Show us some moves... make you feel better. Okay. Um, but I'm... I'm just learning. So... Oh, shoot. I messed it up. I'm supposed to get back to here. - Hey. - That was beautiful. Good boy. - Come on, Hobby. Uh-oh. Watch out. - Come on, Hobbs. Give him a fight. - I'm not feelin' that good. My dad was this Golden Gloves champ. - On your feet, knave. - Let's see how you fight. Let's see you jab. Let's see you jab. - Hobbs, get up! - Come on, come on! Hobbs, come on, give him a good jab. - Come on. - Ah! - Oh, shit, man. - You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Hobbs, you fight like a baby. - I need some ice. Who fights with their glasses on? Oh, don't worry. His face is used to this. - Let's get some dessert. - You gonna make it? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Jeez. You come all the way back from Europe and you punch me in the fucking nose. Excuse my language. You haven't lost your touch. He's a little rusty. Oh, hey, Hobbs. Cole here is a drummer. Ah, that's good. See, you kids need to swing, man. Your music is so loud, you're bashing your brains in. I don't know how you can think about playing any music. Who's your favorite? Who do you like, Hobby? Max Roach. - Yeah? That's magic. You float when you hear that music. It seems difficult that a human being could even do it. It's just... - ... wow. - You listen to Max? Max Roach? - Yeah. Great drummer. Sounds familiar. - Played with Clifford Brown. - Played with Charlie Parker. - Yeah, I know Charlie Parker. Joe played with Bird, of course. Really? - Yeah, yeah. I played with Bird. Here in L.A. we played a gig. It was a live air shot and I'm "comping. " He was obviously not happy with me. He was glaring at me. And I didn't know what to do, so I turned the beat around. I started playing everything kind of backwards and he gave me a sterner look and I finally didn't know what to do and I said, "Fuck you, Bird. " And I think it came over the air and he said, "You're fired, Joe. " And... and, uh, he turned and he left, one eye staring at me. I swear to God. Bird... we used to go buy reeds for him... three and a half... cut it down for him. Direct line to God, man. - Yeah. Yeah. I think they're all touched by something wonderful. They're all touched by God. They die for what they believe in. I've heard you play, Joe, and I sincerely think - you have been touched by God. - Thank you, Ma. Hmm. But the positive side, I've been playing, man. Yeah? - I can't believe how much you've been recording. - Oh, yeah? Good to see there's still some people willing to sink a little money into jazz over there. Here's Dad. Hey, go back, go back, go back. He's so serious. It's coming off a little bit. I'm taking the empties back to Mayfair. Do you need any help with them, Grams? - No, thank you, dear. - You sure? Oh, yeah. You two have a good time. I'll be right back. Bye. - Goodbye. Hey. Oh. He was so good. Nobody like that. So how long do we have you here for? Indefinitely. - Indefinitely? - What? - Yeah. I was fucking deported. Fuck, man. For what? For holding less than one lousy ounce of pot. - No. - Yeah. They took me down, stamped my passport "cancelled" and threw me on the first plane. I can't go back for three years. Shit, man. - Democratic nominee - Jimmy Carter was busy explaining what he meant in a weekend interview with the Associated Press. Thanks, Mom. You know, let her know what the hell is goin' on here. The first thing in the morning, you've got to go downtown and see if you can find yourself a public defender. End of story. No more bullshit. ...$8,000 annual income might be the dividing point. The Democratic Party and the great leaders of the Democratic Party... Two, three... And then go to the interject? And then... okay. So that last part again. So... that last part real quick. Dum-dee-da... And now we'll go to the interject. They've only been playing together a few weeks. Really? Sorry about that. We're... this is the one... that's the first one that we actually wrote together. It's supposed to be kind of a medley thing. Chapter two of a 16-part... yeah. We're still working on it a lot. Let's do this at 51. Okay, one, two, three... - Cole! - Cole! No! Don't hold him down... that's how he'll get hurt. Yeah, just clear everything away around him. - Should I call an ambulance? - No, not yet. Have you got a blanket? Clear the way! Clear the way! Take it easy. Take it easy, man. Take your time. Hey. Hey. Is that part of the... part of the act or...? I sure missed this little joint. He'll be okay, Jo. I know it's a frightening thing to witness, but, I daresay, you get used to it. I'm glad you were there. - I'm glad you're here. - Wow. You better be, 'cause you're stuck with me now, kid. You and Cole seem really... connected. That's nice to see. I think we are. We have a lot in common. Ah, that's good. That's really good. Listen, Jo. I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything. You know? Stuff with boys... things like that. You might feel uncomfortable and... No. No, I wouldn't. I mean, I'd ask your advice or whatever. I'd tell you things. I'm glad. Your mother and I are both very... sensuous beings. Passionate. I always assumed you'd take after us, so... I don't know. I guess I am. I mean, Cole's very... "passionate. " But I haven't been with anyone else besides him. Ah. Well, that's fine. Mm-hmm. Man, I have a big day tomorrow. We should hit the road. Are you ready? Ma, do I have any clean handkerchiefs? What? Do I have any clean handkerchiefs? - Hand soap? - Handkerchiefs! Oh, handkerchiefs! - "I'm sorry, sir. I... I'm clean. I... I promise to do whatever it takes. " Aw, Jesus Christ. Okay. What the...? Get rid of that fucking dope. Don't flush it. Joe. Jesus. Oh, hey, Amy. Step aside, man, and hear my tale. Yeah, yeah. Thought maybe you were some of "L.A.'s finest. " No, no, 'tis Greeks bearing gifts. - For you. - Thank you so much, Joe. Yeah. Thanks, man. Wow. Joe. Yeah. Wow. It... This is not mine. Kitty, come here. The coast is clear. Joe, Amy, this is Kitty. Hi, I'm Kitty. Yeah, she's a singer. I've been working with her voice a little. Hi. Kitty. Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Joe. - A singer, huh? - Yeah. Hey, Amy. Can I offer you some pop? - Or some water maybe? - No, I'm good. - Oh, okay. - You sure? So what's going on, man? Well, I had my day in court. - Yeah? - Excuse me. So what's it gonna be? Are they gonna send you up for a spell? No, not that. But... I got five years' probation. That's 1,825 days. Some kid. She was a math major. Yeah. They dole out any other punishment? - N.A. meetings? - Nah, thank God. If I never see the inside of another one of those sewing circles of misery, - I'll be doing all right. - Hear, hear. You sure dodged a bullet there, Giuseppe. - Yeah. - The judge a jazz fan or what? Are you psychic now, Hobby? I don't think so. Because he was a jazz fan. A big-time fan of the recordings I did with Prez. Far fucking out, man. The legendary Joe Albany rides into the sunset! Fantastic! Congrats. Man, man, man. Am I itching to play. Anywhere, anytime. How 'bout we try to book some practice time down at the union? Maybe get a couple cats together, maybe not. But at least we're playing. Hell, worst case, we can try and clean up this ungodly sty and practice here, but... Yeah, I got rid of the piano. It was a real piece of shit, anyways. Remember? You still have your horn, right, Hobby? Well, that brass bitch... that one done run off with the ol' piano. - Hmm. - I hear they shacked up - at that pawnshop over on Third. - Yeah. - Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Hey, hey, hey. - Fuck! - Who's that? Well. Hello. And thank you, my dear. Oh, sorry about the interruption there. But, you know, pssh... I forgot my key. Lew's in between pads. He's staying here just temporary-like. Well, we're gonna get going. Joe just came by to share some glad tidings, man. Don't go. You just got here. - Come on, Amy. Well, it was nice to meet you. Oh, yeah. Nice to meet you as well. - It was nice to meet you. - We can still play, Joe. - Get your horn, man. That's your daughter, huh? Hey, ain't you all grown up now? Come on, Jo. So listen, Nat. I've been trying to line up some gigs and I know you're the main man about town, so... Oh? Uh-huh. Yeah, that's what I hear. Drag. Yeah. Well, okay. If anything comes up, I do mean anything, I am ready, willing and able. Yeah, it's Hollywood 6-4636. That's correct. All right, well, keep up the good fight and hopefully I will speak with you soon. Okay, take care, Nat. Yeah, bye. No luck? - Not yet. But hope, she springs eternal, my dear. I got a whole book of hope right here. Is this Mom's number? I think so. Mm, yeah. Does she ever cross your mind? No, not often. Well, maybe she should. I mean, she did have something on the ball once upon a time. Besides being a drunk. Don't do that, Jo. We all fall down on our ass. We all need a hand getting up. I want you to grab on. Grab me. - You okay? - Yeah. Best mud of your morning. - It's kind of squishy. - Feels good. You okay? Yeah. You wanna hop up here? Anything to drink? Yeah, I'll... I'll have a ginger ale, please? And two phone books? That's great. Thanks. - Are you okay? - I don't feel well. Did you take your pills? I threw... I - I threw them out. Is that okay? Okay. No, they made me feel like shit. Sorry. - It's also getting dark... - Yeah. - Oh, my God! - It's okay. Thank you. What the fuck are you looking at?! I'm sorry! I'm gonna go call Gram, okay? Sir, please walk outside. No! Stop! He's sick! He has seizures! He can't help it! He's sick! You're not helping the situation any better. - Calm down! - He can't control it. He's sick! You are not helping this! He's sick! He has epilepsy! He's sick and he can't help it! He has seizures! Calm down. He would've been admitted there not long ago... one hour, maybe two. One moment. Are you a relative? Yes, I am. Well, he's being held for evaluation. What does that mean exactly? Psychiatric evaluation. You can speak with the doctor in the morning. Yes. Thank you. I'll do that. What did they say? Cole's getting the medical attention that he needs now. All right? Please, cara mia, don't fall apart. All right? - Can I see him? - Of course you're gonna see him. Oh, Joe. Thank God you're here. Cole had a seizure and was arrested, and Amy... I don't wanna hear about that now, Ma. I just need some fucking peace. No! That's what you need. Shh, shh. Look at me. Look at me. - All right? - I can't. I want you to try to sleep. Shh, shh. - I can't. - Shh, shh, shh. You're a strong girl. You're a strong girl. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. May I leave a note for Sheila Albany? Have you checked the bar down the street? No. Can I help you? I was looking for... Sheila Albany. Sheila, if you know this kid, better tell her to get lost. That's my kid. Come over here. Sit down. Well, you came looking for me. So now what? I wanted to see you. Huh. Well, there's not much to see anymore. You want something? No, I'm good. And a ginger ale for my fair charge. You look more like Joe all the time. What does he have to say about me? He doesn't say anything about you. How is he? He's in bad shape. I don't know how to help him. It is a true pity that he was forced to come back to this creative wasteland. "Forced to come back"? Deportation. Least that's what he told me. Didn't he tell you, his little musketeer? Sure, I knew that. I just didn't know he was talking to you. Well, we speak quite frequently. He told me about your boyfriend and his unfortunate affliction. An interesting choice for your deflowering, I'll give you that. - What are you talking about? - Never mind. Let's... let's talk about you. I mean, what are you into? Are you... a scholar or a cheerleader or something quite different altogether? Your father is very concerned for your welfare. And let's just say the reports I've been getting are less than stellar. - I don't believe you. - Hmm? I don't believe you. No? I can't say I blame you. But nonetheless, I'm afraid it's true. Your father fears that on top of you being no longer a virgin, that you suffer from a sort of self-loathing. But I'm afraid what pains him most is that you are... and I quote... "no academic. " So now that the cards are on the table and I know all your dirty little secrets... let's reassess. First, the, um... it's apparent that you're... no scholar. Oh, dear. Second, judging by your father's reference to self-loathing, you couldn't possibly be a cheerleader. However, there seems to be an indication that you may well just be a slut. What, no answer? It's funny, 'cause you do rather look like one. Thanks. That's all I needed to hear. - Bravo. - Fuck you. Okay, I'd like to welcome any newcomers who are joining us tonight. And if anyone is new for the first time here, could you please raise your hands? Welcome. - And your name? - Joe. Welcome, Joe. Thanks. Would you like to share with us? Uh... I'm not sure of the setup here. Well, uh... I've been on dope for about 30 years now. Uh, that's over half my life in and out of prisons, nuthouses, what have you. I think that... I hope... that I can say with some knowledge that the longer you live with this, the more it'll place you in some terrifying scenes. That said... I'm, uh... I'm not here to take some pledge... I'll likely never keep. Because for all its inherent horrors and soul suffering, I must confess, I love getting high. Anyway... You see, I have a daughter Amy, and... I have a daughter that I hope to... that I need to... shepherd. Pardon me, miss. I'll give you $50 if you'd be so kind as to let me have a look at one of those. Get lost, shitkicker. Ah, don't be that way, darlin'. How 'bout a hundred for the both of 'em? Is Hobbs here? Uh, no. He's out for the evening. Anything I can do for you? Come on in. So... How can I be of assistance to you? I need to get some stuff for my dad. He's sick. I don't know if I know what kind of "stuff" you're talking about, exactly. Yes, you do. Is your dad out there hidin' someplace just waitin' to come in here and, uh, filet me like some kind of fish or something? No. He doesn't know I'm here. Can I just get it now? You know... it's kinda funny. 'Cause I was just thinkin' about havin' a little taste of this myself. You wanna share it with me? Thank you, Johnny. I think it's time for a new total on our board. The time is exactly, uh, 12:10. And let's take a look and see what's doing on the total board. That's the old total, Bob. We've got to get a new total up there. So I'll tell you what... - First of all, we have - JM Service Company, $100. We certainly thank you... Very good. And I have one here that I need to read. It's from "a proud grandma. " It's Opal Mayer, or Meyer I think it's Mayer. She pledged 35... That was fantastic. I want you to hit that note... Joe...? Once again, 361-4141. We're gonna be here all night and tomorrow and we want to hear from you. Now we're gonna go back... Come sit down by me. My poor lost boy. Johnny, do you have one more thing to add? One more thing, please, Monty. I have a young girl, her name is Judy Stiles and she gave me $25 when I went and had my... hair done. Nice girl. She said, "I have a healthy child"... Hey, is that my darling daughter? Yes, Dad. Come here a sec. I want you to know something. I want you to know that there's a gentle Savior who is smiling down upon you. And His hand will always be there to guide you with loving benevolence. Dad was always trying to get clean, and he would now and then. But his time passed and he died just shy of his 64th birthday. I wondered how it felt to float like him. And for many nights to come, I would float above the darkness of my life. Did being the most luminous object in the galaxy justify sacrificing all earthly cares? I decided... fuck it. It didn't. You're being recorded, you're being recorded.
