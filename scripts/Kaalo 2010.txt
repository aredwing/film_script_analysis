Every incident had a story... One such incident had occurred in. ...Northern India in a village named Kulbhata. During 18th century, this village, surrounded by a desert, was tormented by a witch named Kaalo. Kaalo wanted to sacrifice nubile girls to satisfy... ...her greed for immortality. One day she was stoned to death and buried by angry villagers... ...but her fear lived on in and around Kulbhata. Years later some villagers spoke of Kaalo's sightings yet again. Kulbhata was vacated overnight by scared villagers. All roads leading to Kulbhata were sealed by horrifying tales... ...of Kaalo killing anyone who dared to enter Kulbhata. It is said, Kaalo still roams in Kulbhata... ...in a more ferocious form than before. And it is believed that since that incident... ...no one has gone to Kulbhata. Until a bus carrying some passenge on its way to Kuldevi... ...had to pass through Kulbhata Respected father, I am coming back. I id not reply to any of your letters until now because I myself didn't have any answers. But I do now. I am bringing joys for the village with me. I have a whole lot of explosives. We will dig a well in our village. No one will lack water now, father. We will have everything. Your son, Sameer.

Uncle, we played with those things in childhood. Want to see the power of this string? Until Goddess Kuldevi's blessings are here, no trouble can enter this bus. Amazing! Nonsense! - It's fire proof! - See, we can make a costume out of it. And you can put me on fire. - Brilliant idea! It will be a photo shoot on fire. - Nikhil, what this old man is saying... - Relax. Chhotu, what happened? Even I smoke, but it's forbidden in a bus, right Thank you. What happened? - Great! - What was that hero saying? What happened? - We have a flat tyre. Get down all of you, we have a flat tyre. Damn this bus! They should not leave the bus. They shouldn't. They don't know what a big risk they are taking. Chhotu, what's happened to you? It's nothing, just a flat tyre. Come, let's have a smoke. - Damn him. Come on. Come! - He's such a sissy. Why do you bring him along? I told you not to bring him. - Why are you always after him? - Bury him alive. Come on! What? What are you up to? That's the problem with me.

They are being very foolish. Why don't they understand that they'll only find death. They don't know that this is the beginning of our end. I think we should leave. Even we may get sacrificed because of them True. - No. We will all go together. We cannot leave anyone behind. Hey jerk! Come out! Chhotu. It's the effect of the joint. Chhotu. Why don't you understand? Know wha taking a dead body with you means? It means taking death along. What do you mean, you rogue? I should leave my friend here? Chhotu is our responsibility. Let's do one thing. We'll call an ambulance. But my mobile is working here. There's no network. Then to save us from legal hassles we'll have to leave the body here. What nonsense are you talking? This man was with us. We cannot leave his body behind in the jungle. Sorry friend, I was only joking, when I told you to die. But you really... He's dead. Come. You betrayer. Guddu, why are you standing there? Please come. Get in. What had to happen is over with. Who can avoid what is destined? Come, let's go. Come on! Guddu. I'm on a high. Come inside. Chhotu. Chhotu. Come. I've been driving since so many years... ...but such a thing has never happened. 'Destiny'; while getting this printed on the bus, I never knew, that no one can get anything before time... ...and more than one is destined to. Then even if it is someone's life. Boss. Where are you? We have to go. We are getting late. Why are you playing pranks? Boss. Boss. Conductor, why don't you understan Get in the bus. Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss. Boss. Boss. Damn the conductor! Let's go and check. Stop them! - Why are you going out? There's danger lurking outside. - Shut up! Don't go out. - Let's go from here. Cowards! - Come inside. Come! Are you scared? No, I'm not scared. But even they are sitting inside. Wait, I'm coming. You guys go. I'm going up to my Chhotu. He's been lying there alone since so long. You don't understand, you always insist on doing what you want. Blood! What's going on here? Let's go, or even we will die. You are sleeping? Making me cry, you are sleeping here? Who will roll my joint? Huh? Let's go. - Wait! Where did the jerk go? What have we got to do with the conductor? Let's go back. Look at this blood. It's only over here, nowhere else. It seems like from here, straight up... Run! Guddu! What happened? Tell us what happened? What did you see? What happened? What happened? Why don't you tell us what happene Conductor... his blood... - Blood? Someone from above... - Shona? Shona. Shona. You'll come to no harm, child. Oh God. Kaalo has come for this child. Oh, so this is the girl because of whom all this is happening? Throw her out! Even I saw it. That witch looked at her. Throw the girl out! If we don't throw her out, the witch will kill us all. If the root of the problem is this girl, let's throw her out. - Throw her out! - She's not a kid, she's death for all of us. Throw her out! Don't any of you dare to touch the girl! Shona will not go anywhere. And if anyone touches her, remember, I will kill him before Kaalo does! Kaalo! Listen, Kaalo has seen us. And whoever she sees once, she doesn't spare them. We must leave this place and leave the borders of Kulbhata. But she will never let that happen My God! The witch has seen us! Don't worry, it's going to be alright. Sit tight. I will get everyone out of here. - Damn Kaalo! I'll deal with the witch! - Careful! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! She's Kaalo! She went under the bus. The tank of the bus is leaking. Everyone get out. Get out! Ouick! Hurry! Run! Rukmini, run fast! Shona! Run! Run fast! Careful! Shona! Run! Run! Guddu, we have to get rid of this girl, or we all will die. Let's go. Leave my hand. She's somewhere here. Run! Run! Rukmini, run, run, run! Faster. Faster. Hasmukh, let's go! Let's move. Fast! Fast! Fast! Oh my God. Where's my hat? I'll just get my hat. No Hasmukh, where are you going? Hasmukh, no. Hasmukh. Hasmukh, come back! Hasmukh! Are you mad? Hasmukh, please don't go. Hasmukh. Hasmukh. Hasmukh. Hasmukh, please. Hasmukh, please don't. Hasmukh, please don't go. Hasmukh, come back. Hasmukh! Hasmukh! Hasmukh! Hasmukh! Hasmukh! Hasmukh! Careful. Hurry! Over here. Rukmini! Relax. Relax. Come. What are you doing? I'd brought explosives to dig a well in my village. But I guess it's required more over here now. It's no use. - What do you mean? There are some powers that can be destroyed only with their power Even Kaalo can be killed with her own weapon, none else. - Where can we get her weapon from? - Then nothing can be done. No power in the world can save us from dying. There are some weapons that can stall her death for some time, but not finish her. So what should we do? Just sit back and do nothing? Sit here and wait for death to com That is the truth, Sameer. We cannot do anything. Certain things are beyond mankind. We have to kill her, then whether she is a witch, or anyone else. Then whether she dies with her weapon, or with explosives. There is one option. What option? There is a jeep over there. If I reach there somehow, we may not have to kill Kaalo. No, you will not go there. You won't. Sir, I don't know how ferocious Kaalo is. But I will fight until I am alive. We'll come to no harm, dear. Sir, take care of Shona. - Yes. He must be a dead man by now. So what do we do now? You take care of the old couple. Oh God, what do we do? Sameer is not to be seen. Could Kaalo have... - No. Until then, I'll get rid of that jinxed girl. Uncle, send that girl here. Uncle. Come on. Glory to Lord Hanuman, a sea of knowledge' Glory to the Monkey God, the enlightened one" A devotee of Lord Ram, he is very brave" He's the son of Anjani and Pawan, the God ofWind" Ghosts and spirits cannot come near you" When you chant his name He can cure all illnesses, eliminate all pain' Just invoke him Listen! Just listen! Guddu! Guddu! Sameer, listen to me. Guddu, help! Someone stop them! - Uncle, help! Sameer, leave him. - Uncle! Sameer, leave him. - Leave him! Why are you fighting? - What are you two doing! Stop! Move! Sameer, leave him. Uncle! Uncle! Enough! Enough! Why are you after each other's lif If you have to fight each other and die, why are you running away in fear from Kaalo? Huh? Why are you running away from her? If you have to fight, don't fight to belittle each other Fight to finish Kaalo. Fight to finish Kaalo. I trusted you, sir. I trusted you! I trusted you. - I got scared. Let's run out of here. Come. Come on! Hurry! Chandan, remove it. Remove it! Hey! Remove it fast! Remove it, Chandan! Chandan. Hey! Chandan! Forgive me, friend. I feel she is flying over us. I don't want to die. I'm going.
