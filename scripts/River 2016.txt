I don't know what you guys do. I want nothing to do with this. Fuck, you scared the shit out of me, man. Can you leave the door open, please? Thank you. Hi. - Sorry. - It's okay. I'm Beverly Hartwick. I'm John. What can I help you with? I was at a bar a couple nights ago, down south... there were two girls having drinks with some Australians... they were getting really drunk, and... uh... this one girl couldn't have been more than 90 pounds... Her name was Nang... Can I see your passport, John? Yeah. Sorry, just give me a second. Please, please. Let me explain. It's okay. Yeah, hi. It's Bev. No, those fax dipnotes we received this morning... Can you read them to me again? Has a time been set? No. That's good. Thank you. Did you come here to turn yourself in? No, I came here for you to help me. I'll be honest, beyond accessing legal council... there's not much more we can really do. I can get you a list of some good lawyers here in Vientiane. Can I do that for you? Yeah. Okay. I'll be right back. What is he doing here? Why is he with you? I'm sorry. It's not his fault. I told him you were expecting me. I didn't know what else to do. I just need to get my money, then I promise I'll go. There's nothing there. The police raided it. They took everything. Take him back to his apartment. John, it's Stephanie. I wasn't sure if you've eaten. The government wants to shut us down because... one of our doctors is wanted for murder and sexual assault. The senator's son, or whoever the fuck he is... He attacked me' I defended myself. I don't know what happened down there, John. Please tell me you don't believe... This has nothing to do with what I believe... Showing up here has made the situation so much worse than it already is. I had money here... What are you going to do? I'm gonna cross into Thailand. Make my way to Bangkok. Fly home on my return ticket. This is an Australian politician's son... You don't think that INTERPOL is involved? I don't have a choice. I'll take my chances. And if I get stopped at the airport, the US Embassy will... get involved, and I will face the consequences there... but one thing I can not do is be caught here. I sympathize with you, but there is nothing I can do for you. I need you to help me. Stay the night, but in the morning... Fuck me, man. Mr Lake. John Lake'! My name is Patrick Reardon. I'm with the American Embassy in Bangkok. What time is it? It's about 9:30. In the morning? Yes, in the morning. I've been here for... four days. We just heard about you yesterday. You're without a passport. There's no record of you entering Thailand... at any of the airports or landcrossings... and you were caught crossing the Mekong illegally. So, you're gonna be deported. Under normal circumstances... you'd be sent back home in a couple of days... but Laos has filed an extradition request. It seems there's an outstanding warrant for your arrest. There is. Well, if they can satisfy the Kingdom of Thailand's extradition requirements, then you'll be sent back to Laos. How much time do I have? Before you're extradited? Everything has to be cleared and vetted by the courts here. It varies. I don't know. Six months, maybe? It could be a year. Now... Now, I'm told that you threw a bag into the river before you were apprehended? Did they find it? No. You'll only be here a few days before you're transferred... to a larger facility in Bangkok. I was hoping I could, uh... call home, call some family for you? You got family? You can call my sister. Her name is Natalie Lake. She's a nurse. Presbyterian in Chicago. You're gonna need money. And, obviously, clothes. Can I reach out to your sister for that too? You can ask, yes. Thank you. Hang tight, John. When will I see you again? I'll see you in Bangkok. John! How are you? I'm okay. Good. This is Mr Nishant Pan... from Thai immigration. You're being deported today. No, you're going home, John. Back to New York City. Laos withdrew the extradition request. I'm going home? The case was flimsy. They didn't have enough to convict you... At least, not enough to satisfy the courts here. We would have had you out a few days ago, but there was a... misunderstanding between the courts and immigration. It happens. Take this. It's a letter from the Thai government... your flight itinerary. This was reissued. Your uh, sister sent some more money. I'll need you to sign for it. She also sent you this... Clothing, for the return journey. Let's get you out of here. Thai Immigration is gonna take you to Suvarnabhumi... and make sure you get on that plane. Thank you. Thank you. Can I see that? Did you know about this? No, but I'm not surprised. He raped that girl. It's complicated. John, you have to understand, in a situation like this... with a foreigner, a politician's son... the police are under enormous pressure... to find the guilty party. It's a miscarriage of justice, but there's nothing you can do. It's not something you can change... John, don't! John! Hey! Hello. Ticket to Laos. Okay.
