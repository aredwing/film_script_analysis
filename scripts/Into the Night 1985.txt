King ] Caught in a quick sand and I'm startin' to sink So tired of strugglin' that my mind can barely think I don't know where I'm goin' Lord, I don't know what I'm gonna do My fuel supply is finished There ain't nothin 'left to burn I need someone to help me But I don't know which way to turn I know I don't have much of a choice I'll go out of my mind Or into the night I'm rollin' and tumblin' Spinnin' end over end Got to have some peace and quiet So I can find myself again Still if you ask me what's the matter I just don't know what to say There's people all around me but I feel so alone I guess they'd like to help me But I have to do it on my own I know I don't have much of a choice I'll go out of my mind Or into the night Into the night Do you want some coffee? Just a minute. What did you say? Do you want me to make you some coffee? No. No, thanks. Aren't you hungry? Oh, yeah, sure. What's the matter, Ed? Why aren't you sleeping? I don't know. Well, what can I do? Just love me, okay? Oh, that's Stan. What is it? Am I doing something wrong? - No, of course not. - Well, what is it? I don't know. Oh, we better go. Herb's probably going berserk by now. - Herb can wait. - I gotta go. Have a nice day. "Have a nice day"? KABC 79 Los Angeles It's the Ken and Bob Company. Loman and Barkley I'm moving! I'm moving! In the morning Hear how good Our country sounds KLAC Rick Dees in the morning KIIS-FM KOST- 103. Good morning. I'm David K. Duncan. Commander Chuck Street with traffic. How's it going? we've got a slowdown on that south bound Pasadena freeway. This is the Dave Hull program on KRLA, but we are gonna interrupt the show now for this special announce-- Don't you want to hear what happened? No, not really. If it's important, I guess they'll let us know anyway. Ah, a smilel Okay, now we're gettin' somewhere. All right, Mr. No-Sleep, I have something for you. What's three miles long and has an I.Q of 165? A Saint Patrick's Day parade. Actually, it's a Cinco de Mayo parade. I can't sleep anymore, Herb. Are you gonna be all right? I don't wantyou nodding off at the wheel. No, no, I'm fine. We can switch. I'm fine. I'm okay. I don't know. I don't know. My job is a dead end. I feel weird, like I'm from another planet or something. Ellen kissed me on the top of my head this morning and said, "Have a nice day. " - Can you believe that? - What's wrong with that? Bank tellers say, "Have a nice day." The cashier at the supermarket says, "Have a nice day." I just think that somehow yourwife should say something better than, "Have a nice day." You're losing your mind, Ed. How long have you had insomnia? My last good night's sleep? Yeah, the full eight hours. Seems like... 1980. Yeah, the summer of 1980. You're in bed. You can't sleep. I don't see the problem. You go to the airport, catch the midnight flight to Las Vegas. Nobody sleeps there. Very funny, Herb. No, listen, I'm serious. You need some action. I'm not a gambler. Don't gamble. Have a few drinks. See a show. Get loose. Get laid. Oh, wonderful. I'm sure Ellen would love it. You'll be home before she wakes up. Sex isn't the problem. When was the last time you fucked your wife? You're a classy guy, Herb. Up in Vegas, there's a beautiful, young girl named Melissa. She will do anything you want for $200 an hour. Two hundred dollars? Anything you want. Anything. For example? if you want, she'll dress up like Santa Claus. Would she bring me a pony? You're having trouble with this concept. I'm talking about the universe of infinite possibility. No such thing. The only limits are money and imagination. Sorry. I'm a little short on both. Hello, Fielding. How much would I have to pay one of these women for sympathy? Sympathy? Very kinky, Ed. I'll see you at lunch. Ed Okin. They're claiming we've got a synchronization problem. Naturally, this has nothing to do with their god-awful carrier tracking loop. They want full tolerance checks on all buggers, sensors and corresponding transducers. Scanners seem to check out. Yeah, but that's on the uplink. The problem is downlink. Ed, have you got the signal-to-noise ratio on the downlink? Ed? Yeah? - have you got it? - What's that? Yep, we're having synchronization problems. I need the signal-to-noise ratio on the downlink. Signal-to-noise. Right. Um, mm-hmm. - Right. - I've got it here. I was just, uh-- Uh... signal-to-noise, signal-to-noise. - Signal-to-noise: 5.3 db. - Five point three? What modulation scheme? - Uh, B.P.S.k. - "B.P.S.k."? Isn't that correct? we switched to Q.P.S.K. two weeks ago. Q.P.S.K.? It was incredible. I can't tell you how I felt. It was incredible. I can't tell you how I felt. I wish I'd seen it. The whole place was excited. I couldn't talk my wife out of going to the orchid show. Everyone was there. - if you missed it, you can see it on cable. - His family was there.

She probably lives there. Not for years. They barely speak. Bizarre. Go ahead. I'm sorry, you folks are gonna have to leave now. - We're friends of Bud Herman's. - Mr. Herman sent me over. He wants you to leave now. Fine. We're going. What about my cab? I'll take you to your car. Let's just get out of here. do you know where downtown they take the cars? I've gotta get ahold of Hamid. Shit. do you know where to go? No, I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. We're going to find my car. Would you help me, please? Just a little more. No! I've gotta go home. No more. I've got problems of my own to deal with. How do you think I feel? You're all I've got. Well, that's hard to believe. You're tellin' me. if you want any more help from me, I wanna know what's going on. You wanna know what's going on? Yes. All right. Have a seat. Okay. They killed him. - killed who? - Hasi. "Hasi"? In the parking lot. I-- I was with him. He was waiting for me. The stones were his. - We have to get the police. - No, I can't. I smuggled them in. - What stones? - Six perfect emeralds. They're priceless. They killed this guy for six emeralds? How'd you get involved in all this? The stones are from the scepter of an ancient Persian king. Remember when the Shah fell and the royal family fled Iran? The treasury was looted. Somebody got away with a good part ofthe crown jewels. Hasi was "somebody's" cousin. Um... he was gonna give me $25,000. So I went to Zurich. I went to a vault. Everything went fine. He met me at the airport. - Who killed Hasi? - They wanted the stones. If I lose the stones, I'm dead for sure. The police can't help me. I'm one of the bad guys. Who were those men chasing you at the airport? I don't know. I've got to make some kind of deal with them. - With who? - That's what I have to find out. I know they're all Iranians or Persians or something. I-- If they're on visas, they don't want trouble. Well, this is kind of outside my field. Oh, Christ. I can't get ahold of Jack. He would help me. - Who's Jack? - He's a friend of mine. - Is he involved in this? -Jack? No! Jack doesn't need any more money. I guess he doesn't need me anymore either. Maybe if you explained to the police that you were doing a job-- That I'm a smuggler? No. Okay, so now what? I know someone else who could help me. Would you help me get to him? It's my only way out of this. No. You did it before at the airport. I'm not sure what I did at the airport. You saved my life. They don't know who you are. Right now they don't know where I am. Just stay with me for a little while longer. How do you know you can trust me? Because I know men. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What am I doing here? This is insane. I'd do it myself, but I don't know who's there. I promise I won't ask anything else. This is awfully good, sir. I think you can feel very confident with that. We'll just raise the shoulder a little, put a tuck in there. Good. Excuse me, dear. We've all got homes to go to. This is the phone number... to the pay phone in ladies' room. Give it only to Hamid. It's just straight up Rodeo? Yeah. Oh! Wait. Uh, it's private. You'll have to show this at the door. "Jack Caper"? - Is he the one with the wife? - Yeah, the one I can't reach. - Was that his boat? - Yes. Nowgo on. Okay. After I talk to Hamid, I'll-- I'll pickyou up right here in front of Tiffany's.

I'm gonna ask you one more time. do you know what they were looking for? I don't fuckin' believe this. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to get some information from you before I can let you go. Oh, sure. Would you just walk me to my car? Sean,Jeff, come on, get out ofthe car. These men work for me. Ed. Uh, Pierre, come on out and meet Sheriff-- Peterson. Sheriff Peterson. Sheriff Peterson, this is my husband, Ed. And this is our good friend, Pierre, from Paris. Can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you. I-- Pierre doesn't speak English. He's such a good cook though, who cares? well, it's nice to meet you all. if you'll just-- Oh, I'm sorry. Um, my name is Mrs. Ed O-O-- C-Cohen. Uh, C-o-h-e-n. Um, I live at 1234 Malibu Canyon Road. Malibu, California. And our number is 456-2199. And our number is 456-2199. That's fine. we'll, uh, most likely be in touch with you within the next two days or so. Oh, look at the time! Honey, we're going to be really late! Oh, you're right. It was nice meeting you, Sheriff. Thank you so much. Uh, Sean,Jeff, could you walk Pierre over to the Roberts' house? We're so late as it is, and it's only a block from here. See you later, Pierre. Bye, Sheriff. So, uh, are you having... a nice time in America? I know it's here somewhere. "Somewhere"? Yeah, I had to use it once. I ruined a silk blouse. Must have been awful for you. There it is. The only thing I can't handle is snakes. At this point, a snake would be reassuring. Now what? Well-- Well... the grounds are crawlin' with servants during the day. We wait here till dark. You're kidding. It's only noon. Mmm. Ah. Try to rest. Get some sleep. Sleep here? Diana-- I'm gonna try to grab a nap. Diana? You scared the shit outta me. It's dark. I've been watching you sleep for nine hours. Can we go now? Oh, boy, I really conked out. Yes, you did. Mmm. This thing's locked. No, it comes off. Maybe it did once. You must be stronger than you look. Jack? What's happened to you? They say my blood's gone bad on me. I'm buying it by the case like champagne. Are you, uh, in pain or-- I can't even get any interesting drugs. It's good to see you, Peach. I couldn't figure out what Joan was doing here. I had no idea. After years of compulsive spending, she's finally... taking an interest in estate planning. Did she tell you I called? When? When? Jack, I've been trying to get ahold of you for six months. It's Joan. That bitch. She's very thorough. Who's this? Oh, um, Ed Okin. I got myself into trouble, and he's the only one I've been able to count on. - What is this? - It's an orgy. You're trespassing. Get them out. If they won't leave, call the police! Larry, disregard that. - You are endangering his life! - Get her out, Larry. Whoeveryou are, or thinkyou are, there have been a dozen just like you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to come here. You better hurry and tell me the problem. Hasi's dead. Hasi's dead? Yeah. Hamid too. How? Hasi sent me to Zurich to get some stones out of a safety box. Theywere left to him and-- He needed money in a hurry, and he used you to get 'em into the country. That little shit. People have been trying to kill me too. Yeah, Larry told me about the men in the boat. Must be Shaheen. Hasi's aunt? Did you ever meet her? Hard as nails. She's got a deal in escrow. Major development downtown. Escrow closes in a week, and she's gotta come up with a bundle. She called me for a short-term loan, a big one, but, uh, I didn't need the headache. She mentioned that she might take Hasi in as a partner, if he could raise enough cash. She had to know about the stones. Wait a minute. This is all about a real estate deal? - She can have them. I'll keep my mouth shut. - A real estate deal? Honey, you know enough to get 'em locked up or deported. My wife sells real estate. Not to mention blackmail and murder. It's not just the stones anymore. You're gonna have to negotiate with Shaheen. Negotiate? Offer to sell her the stones. She'll understand that. - What about the Frenchman? - What Frenchman? Someone else who wants to kill us. Well, whoever he is, he can't possibly be as dangerous as Shaheen. - What do we do? - Go around by my office. The number's on the Rolodex. - Shaheen Parvizi. - Parvizi, right. I'll just wait outside. Okay. You get out of the country and start again. This'll probably be the best thing that ever happened to you, Peach. I thought you hated me. Bye. I'll miss you. Take care, Peach. I will. Can we borrow a car? Mr. Caper said take any car you want. This is nice. The keys are inside. Be careful, huh? See you at the airport. Okay. Banzai. You've gotta go. Mrs. Caper is really pissed off. Which one is Mrs. Caper's car? I'm not armed. Those are not for you. Are they for me? But only three. For good faith. - Whose good faith? - Yours and mine. - Where are the other three? - Diana's hiding them as we speak. - Where? - I don't know. - I should believe that? Can I help you? Wherever they are right now, it'll be somewhere where they can be discovered by anyone... or destroyed, so we don't have much time. do you have the money? At this bulk, Miss Bailey, I can give you a very good price. Whatever it costs. You only get married once. Only when she's sure about her safety, she'll call. She'll tell you where they can be found. You'll never hear from her again. Then you wait for the call with me as long as it takes. No, she makes the call when we're reunited, when I'm safe too. You expect me to believe you won't take the other half? Good faith. We could've taken them all. How do you know she has not already run away, Ieft you behind with me? I don't. It's a risk we'll both have to take. This girl goes with anyone who takes care ofher. She gives herself away like a fool. She has nothing ofher own, only what's given or what she takes. This is a foolish risk. Right now there's really no choice. for you maybe. Aren't they beautiful? Oh, yes. Gorgeous. Mrs. Parvizi will be by to pick them up in a few hours. All she wants is the money and no more trouble. - Who are you? - That's all she wants. Just what was promised her and her safety. - What about you? - I'm just a friend. A friend? Of Jack Caper's too? You drive his car. What do you want? She said she'd split the money with me. All this risk for $ 12,500? No. Please. - No, of course not. - Then why? The last thing you'd believe is anything close to the truth. The truth is... I'm not sure I know. Somebody had to help her. I happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. - How much did Melville offer? - The French guy? we rejected his offer. Twenty-five thousand dollars is nothing. I do not understand. Okay, you give me the money in cash. when I see Diana, we 'll call and tellyou the location ofthe other three stones. It's simple. Too simple. why? what is it? what's wrong with our plan? There has to be a catch, a trick. I do not trust your plan. I think it's a very good plan. Come on. Time's running out. Escrow is closing. - Did Jack Caper tell you that? - Yes, that's right. - I'm Jack's son. - His son? Illegitimate. But some day it'll all be mine. You and I might be doing business, going out to lunch. All right, okay, fine. I'll tell you the truth. Diana's C.I.A. I'm on Her Majesty's Secret Service. We've got the place surrounded. I'm really from Immigration. We thought you might have some illegal aliens working here. - What are you playing at? - I apologize. I've been lying. I'm actually the chairman ofthe committee to reelect the president. - I was hoping for a substantial contribution. - You are mad. Nowyou don't know what to believe, do you? Look, either you've already lost everything... or you have to take a chance on me. Neither of us have much to lose. If he's still there, you better let him go if you ever want to see those stones alive. A-Again. Ever. I promise if I'm followed, I'll go straight to the police. Besides, it might take every one of you to retrieve the stones. They could be scattered all over the city. - When can we expect this call? - When everyone's safe. Mr. Oskovitz. Mr. Frank Oskovitz, please go to the white courtesy telephone. One minute, sir. One minute. Aero Norte Flight 1 56 to Mexico City now boarding at Gate 53. Boo. Great. What are you doing? What are you doing? We'll miss the plane. I have to make the call. Fuck 'em. We'll do it from Mexico. No, no, no, no. It has to be done now. I want it overwith. You're crazy. The flower market downtown. Yakamura Roses. It's waiting for you. It's in your name. Wait! Wait! Your atencio'n, por favor.

It's more comfortable than out there. I'm very sorry, sir. Rules are rules. ...please go to a white courtesy telephone. Miss Susan Dorgan, please meet your party at baggage area-- Look. Now what happens? - What the fuck-- - Federal Agent! Everybody down! This is ridiculous. Big shot, huh? You got a gun. Now what? Shithead. You. Huh? Maniac. Let me askyou something. Maybe you can help me. What's wrong with my life? Why is my wife sleeping with someone else? Why can't I sleep? What are you doing? Will somebody tell me what we're doing here? Well, at least we're not dead. Maybe we are, we just don't know it. When you die, you don't go to a Ramada Inn. How do you know? And, uh, what's happening here? Sorry, Mrs. Parvizi, but you'll have to come with us. Can we see you in here for a minute, please? - Are we under arrest or what? - I'd say you'd fall into the "or what" category. - Are you a policeman? - I'm a federal agent. Feel better? will you gentlemen excuse us, please? I don't know what's going down here, and I don't want to know. All I know is that this money's clean, and I'm supposed to give it to you. - For what? - Someone-- - Someone very important must like you. -Jack. There's $750,000 right there. All this money is for us? Who you gonna tell? You got 24 hours undisturbed. You're not to leave this room. After that, you're on your own. - Do we Thank you or what? - Follow the "or what" category.
