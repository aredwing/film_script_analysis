I don't take no free tickets on no one's train. Now you take a ticket, or you get run over. and eat with the white folks. Know what I mean? Flirt on your own time, Albert. She's jealous! - Hey, where's my chop? - That was the last one. Hey, I want my fuckin' chop, puerco. Please be courteous to the help. We've run out. We only get pork once a year. I know you got more back there. Only for the kitchen detail. Perhaps one of them might sell you one. - I ain't buyin' what's mine! - You know the fuckin' trip, homes. No freebies. Your mama was a freebie! Hey, tough guy. You want a write-up? Maybe you wanna go to lock-up, huh? Move it! Come on. We got ten minutes here. Let's eat. You sold our meat, Al. You been gettin' by with that shit too long. We ran out. It happens. Now move on, flycatcher. Got hungry men behind ya. you chickenshit motherfucker. In your dreams, Pedro. In your dreams. Where the fuck do you think you're trespassing into, huh? - What do you want? - I thought you wanted it. - What? - My chop. I don't want his pork chop. I want his life. Oy, e, why don't you go play with the polar bears... or the may, ates? They are tu estilo, Toluca. - What's Toluca? - That's the Aztec ball court. Where you lose, you die. - I'm gonna drop you, white boy! - Go ahead, drop me. I ain't afraid to die. Come on! Come on! Come on! Reggie! Carlo! Hey, boy, that shit wouldn't happen if you were up here with Daddy. Fuckin'... You speak Spanish, gero. So do parrots. I'm in here for backing up a carnal. I killed a Tres Puntos 'cause he was gonna take out my partner. Soy, Chicano. Chicanos killing Chicanos is what they want. Blacks and Chicanos killing each other is what they want. That's how they run this place. Once we get together, they don't run shit. You got a lot to learn about being Chicano, gero. I'm no lightweight, and the colour of my skin shouldn't keep me out. White is the enemy. White's the system. You're stuck in the middle. All my fuckin' life I've been kept out. You know what that feels like? Knowing you're a Chicano... and no one accepts you 'cause your skin came out white? My mom's as brown as you are... and my white dad tried to beat every ounce of her outta me. But you know what? He couldn't do it. Chicano's not a colour. It's the way you think and the way you live. And if you're willing to give up your life for a carnal. I'm here to do that. Use me. Use this. You said it. Everything's based on colour, right? I can get places you can't 'cause my skin's white on the outside. But I'm brown on the inside, to the bones. The only way into La Onda is to take down one of our enemies. In your case, it would have to be somebody big. Someone who we can't hit without losing a lot of carnales. Gimme a chance! Trust me. Just one chance! Respect is everything, gero. You ready to die for it? Blood in, blood out. Start cookin' breakfast at 4:30 a.m. Start dinner at 2:00. I'm startin' you on pots and pans, with the niggers. Thanks for nothin'. l-I'll take whatever I can get, Al. - Whatever you say. - That's right, babycake. I knew you'd wise up, sunshine. - That greaser pimp can't do half what I can do for you. - Sounds nice. Hey, Gil. Tell Red Ryder I got that protein powder he wanted. See that? You learn to treat me right, and you get it all. Food, coffee, cigs, drugs. Hell, the works. Come on over here. Hey, clear outta here. It's off-limits to everybody but me and the staff. Hey. You like that? - Oh, that's nice. - Yeah. So's this. So this is where you keep all the goodies, huh? Some of'em. - Pinto beans? - No pintos for you, baby. Nothin' but Texas barbecue. - How 'bout it, sweetcheeks? - Just remember, Al! I fuck who I want, when I want. All right. It's all right. Take it easy. It's all right. You treat me right, everything's gonna be all crimson and clover. Popeye tried to take it. Almost bit his dick off! Well, I can wait, baby. That spic's a pig, got no class. Just don't make Daddy wait too long. Come on now. Come on. - You wild little bitch. - This is just a sample. - I'm gonna fuck your brains out. - When I'm ready, Al. When I'm ready. The prices, they're so high. - The prices don't mean nothing unless they sell that much. - I wanna stay! Cruz, I've been looking everywhere for you. - I'm saying goodbye to my family. - We were just leaving. - Hey, Cruz, can you buy me a low-rider when you get rich? - Thanks for all you've done for our son. - Please. - A low-rider when you get rich! - A low-rider. - I wanna stay with Cruz. - Bye, Alicia. - Come with me, Cruz. People want to meet you. You've got to circulate. You're the artist. You make them look so noble, so, uh, fuerte. I paint what I see. So you really like it, huh? - Oh, yes. - I'm sorry, but I've got to take him to a press photo. - We'll bring him back in a few minutes. - All right. Janis, wh-what are you doing? They were gonna buy something. - Ah, they're looky-loos, window-shoppers. - How do you... - How do you know that, Janis? - Look, I thought we agreed to keep tonight strictly business. Yeah. So? They went in. How come they went in? We both have a lot at stake, Cruz. Don't let them blow it. But, gentlemen, your names are not on the list, and if you don't have an invitation, you can't come in here. Look, we don't need our names on the list, ruca. You see that face up there? That's me. Well, whether that's you or not, it doesn't matter. Miss Weinstock needs to say that it's okay for you to come in. Have yourselves a good time. Enjoy yourselves. There. There's my invitation, okay? Hey, hey, hey. L-It's okay, Belinda. It's all right. It's all right. - It's okay, Belinda. - It's okay, Belinda. Hey, Cruzito. Congratulations. - Come up for an abrazo, ese. - Orale, Gilbert. In a minute, homes. Come check out the carrucha, carnal. Cruz Candelaria, vato. This is big time, homes. Oy, e, it's too bright in here, ese. Too much white. Hey, Cruzito, homes. What happened to our invitation? - What, are you ashamed of Frankie? - Are you ashamed of me, homes? I'm glad you came, but why did you have to bring Gilbert, that culero? - You know Gilbert can smell money from across town, homes. - No shit. - He came to help you spend that plata. - Oh, shit, I can't pay him now, ese. - I've only got ten bucks to my name. - What, with those prices? Hey, shit, I ain't sold nothing, ese. Well, maybe if we jack up a few of these maricones, vato. - I got the guy in the bell-bottoms. - And I'll take everyone without a bra, vato. Be cool, ese. I'm trying to hold it together. Gilbert wants his full payback before he's gonna give us any more credit. - Be quiet. - No, you f... Relax. Here, have some pisto. I'll see what I can do, all right? - He says he'll take this price. - Tell him I'm not negotiating. The price is so low now, it's a steal. - He'll probably pass. - That'll be his loss. Listen, Janis, I need a cash advance. Can you help me? - I've already given you three advances. - I need some money, Janis. What good is it to have a show if I don't sell anything? Cruz, most of your paintings are already spoken for by important collectors. - What? - You'll be completely sold out by the end of the night. Sold out? All of it? Well, then why can't I get some money tonight then? Doesn't work that way. The cheques go to the accountant to be processed. No! I need some money now! Do you understand me? Tonight! Come on. I sold out, so I deserve some, right? You've got a brilliant career ahead of you, Cruz, but all that talent can go right in the garbage. Think about that when you're getting high with your friends tonight. Please, no Baptist sermons, okay, Janis? Strictly business, remember? Thank you. I got a hot tip, Al. How's my credit? - Hey! - Oh, come on. Don't be that way. Nothin' like poppin' that cherry, huh, Al? Red Ryder, your mouth, your mouth. - Lakers won in overtime, Al. - Oh! Give him a green one. No, the other green one. Why do you keep bettin' on them L.A. teams, Lightning? She looks a little bowlegged to me, Al. You're gonna always be runner-up, punk. I'm still gonna cut that VL placa off of you, sissy. Hey, Pancho, don't be a sore loser. Get the fuck out of here. I don't want that greaser pimp even talking to you. Understand me? Tomorrow is your day, gero. Tonight you must read the black book. These are the killing points. The arrows show where a man can be killed. Hit a man here or here, and he dies slowly and painfully. Hit a man here or here, and he dies instantly. When you get to the kitchen in the morning, look in the largest stockpot. Geronimo will be watching. If you're successful tomorrow, you'll become one of us. If you fail, you die. Hey, no, I got that, Howie. Let a real man do the job. It's all yours. All right, you slaves! I want them things cleaned in one hour. Now, move it! You, get to work! Come on now. You heard the man. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. - You got to do what the man says. - Hey, come on, man! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my back! Oh, it's so hot! - What do you want me to do? - Somebody get that off! Oh! Oh, it's burning my back! God! He burned my back on purpose! I know he did! - It hurts, damn it! It hurts! - I know it hurts! I can't do nothing for you. Put-Put it... Put-Put it away! Put it away! Hey! What the fuck are you doing in here? I'm sorry. Excuse me. I didn't know. - What are you doing in here? - I didn't do anything. - This room is off-limits. - You shouldn't be in here, babycakes. - All you men, back it up. - What do you want? - I'm sorry. I just wanted more steel wool. - You are fucking up, Al, letting this kid in here. - That's okay, Bob. He's cool. - Cool, bullshit. Nobody else is supposed to know about this. - I won't say anything. - Shut up! - It's all right, Sergeant. He does what I say. Hey, I am not risking everything for some piece of ass! Just a goddam minute. You get paid plenty for your risk, right? Am I right? - Yeah, right. - Well, all right then. Now, get moving. We got plenty of trips for you to make. And remember, I got a receipt for every dollar you got in that money belt. Hey, what the fuck are you looking at? Get your ass right there, stand there and don't move! Bob, cover that money up. How long does it take you to get back here from the parking lot? - Fifteen minutes. - All right, I expect you back here in... in ten. - You keep this damn door closed. - Don't you give me orders. You just make sure nobody sees you leaving here. God damn you, you little bastard! Don't you ever come in here! I done told you! Now get the fuck out of here! You little prick tease! I'm tired of you swinging your precious little ass around like you own the joint! You haven't put out worth shit! I'm sorry, Al. I fucked up. I know. Forgive me. I thought you were alone. - Get out! - Please don't hold it against me. - Shut up! - Please? Let me make it up to you. I know I've held back, but I'm not gonna do it any more. We don't have a lot of time. Come on. Let's get to it. - Hurry up. Hurry up. - I'm gonna lick you clean. - Do it, bitch. - Lay back and enjoy it. - Shit! - I'm telling you, man. Lieutenant, I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, you're trying to insult my intelligence? You're Onda, he's BGA. Look, I know you're the gang coordinator, but you side on the wolf ticket. - Shit! - Come on. - Don't bullshit me. Have a heart. I'm trying to stay out of trouble. I just want to get out of here. I can make something of my life before I get too old to enjoy it. Al, I told you to keep the door... You fuckin' little shit! Okay, gentlemen, it was just an accident. Get back to work. You got breakfast to make. Man down! Let's go! Storage room. Man down. Let's go. God damn it! You all want to fuck with me? Sergeant, I want you to shake this place down. I want the ID and background on every man in here. All right, I want to know who did it. Somebody in here gets 25 years, or you're all dead, so take your pick. You shut up! I wanna know who did it. Everybody in here goes into lockdown. No exercise, no rec room, no sunshine. Get out of there! No nothin' until I get some answers. And until I do, you're not gonna see the light of day. Sergeant Devereaux! Sergeant Devereaux, I want you to strip-search these men. Everyone here is going to do time in the hole. - Hello! - Hey, big fella. - You'll get it. - Say, Sarge, where's the food? - You'll get it! It's on its way. Sarge, throw us the damn food, man! If I don't get that damn book and money back, you're not gonna walk off this cell block alive. - Do you understand what I'm saying? - Your name's in that book, Bob. - Hey, Bob. - What? Can I get an extra dessert tomorrow? Hey, push this cart over here! Let's move, man! I'm getting hungry up here! Shut the fuck up. - Whose are they? - They're a friend of my brother's, home. But he won't say shit. He's asleep anyway. - You're gonna get in trouble if he wakes up. - Nah, fuck that. All right! Hey, see you later, homes. - He's gonna get pissed at you. - No, I'll kick his ass. - Hey, Cruz! I thought Chuey... - Hey, man, this ain't no playground. - Damn! - Oy, e, pendejo, you don't know how to knock? I'm sorry, but it's cool. I know what's up. Chale, it ain't cool, and you don't know what's up. You understand? I'm sorry. Your place is great, and I wanna come back. Okay, carnalito, but be cool. You can't just barge in anywhere you want. - All right. - Go upstairs and watch TV until Mom comes. I took his shoes and I threw them. Go on. Go upstairs and practise so you can be a badass like Bobby Chacon. - Simn, eh? - Hey, hey, hey! Tell Mom that my back was hurting so I had to take a nap, all right? - Yeah. - Yeah, vete. What the fuck's wrong with you? You can't fucking be sonando yourself when my carnalito's around. - That's cool, homes. - It ain't cool, homes. Come on, Cruzito. Come on, man. Come on down. This will cure your back pain, homes. Ah. Painting those 22 masks is a drag, homes. I'm tired of this assembly-line shit. It's money in the bank, Cruzito. Paint some rucas, homes. It's all right, she said It's all right - Take any, thing y, ou want from me - Take the pain away. Hey, paint some rucas naked. Oh, man. Ese, I don't want to spend the rest of my life... decorating rich people's fucking living rooms. Oh, I want to do something different, ese. You know, the way that I see it, Cruzito... you know, homes, you take the money and you run, vato. Yeah. I'll peddle for you, eh. Fuck 'em, man. I'll paint what I feel. Fly, on, little wing This is your bautismo, gero. We created La Onda, the seven of us. This is the inner circle. Everyone is a capitn and commands his own soldiers. We all have an equal vote, but I am the elected spokesman. This is the last time you will ever sit in this circle. You've proven yourself, so we're admitting you into Onda. It's a commitment for life. As a soldier, you will answer to this council... and carry out our orders without question. Failure to do so is death. Blood in... blood out. Please, somebody! Juanito? God! Help! Somebody, please help! Help! - Don't touch him! Don't touch him! - What's wrong, Mom? - Leave him alone! - Mom? Stop it! You! You did this, you bastard! - We got to get out of here, Cruzito. - Juanito! - There's nothing left! - Cruz! Please bring my baby back. Please. There's nothing we can do! If we don't get outta here, we're fucked! Okay? Come on, please! - Juanito? - Come on! Please get up. Oh, come on. You can do it. Get up. Please, son, get up! Oh, God, no! The Lord is my shepherd. There is nothing I shall want. Fresh and green are the pastures where He gives me repose. Near restful waters He leads me to revive my drooping spirit. Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me all the days of my life. In the Lord's own house shall I dwell... forever and ever. Let us begin. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Let us offer our prayers. Beloved... Not now! Not ever! You are dead to me, like Juanito. Let us pray. Lord Jesus Christ, by Your own three days in the tomb... you allowed the graves of all who believe in You to be made holy. So you made the grave a sign of hope that promises resurrection... even as it claims our mortal bodies. Grant that our brotherJuanito may sleep here in peace... until you awaken him to glory. Then he will see You face to face... and in Your light, we shall see life and know the splendour of God... for You live forever and ever, amen. It's okay, jefito. You can cry if you want. The Aryan Vanguard's been insulted. You spics knew Big Al had an insurance policy with the AV. So when your little lamb strays from the flock... I'm gonna kill the boy! I heard that. Al deserved to die. Besides, your AV-ers owed him more money than anybody else. He still dies. The council has authorized me to make a substantial cash offer... to assure nothing happens to Miklo. - I'm listening. - Half of Al's cash. Eight thousand dollars. We're now open for business. You don't give me squat. You don't even do business unless I say you can. You understand? So? So, what are you giving on the Lakers-76ers? Give the puto four on 76. 76ers and four points. - Give me the Lakers for a hundred. - I'll take some of that action myself. Miklo, if Onda's going into business, carnal... people have to know they can trust us, so treat everybody the same. The AV-ers control the dope, and the BGA-ers are trying to move in on them. We'll do business with both of them. Money knows no colour, carnal. Everybody likes to gamble. All right, all you little old ladies. It's the milkman! Come on. It's time to collect all that milk money. That's all I can do. I'll give you a half point more, that's it. - Yeah. - All right. Hey, man, that's the point spread. - Gotta be cool, bro. - Be cool. Christmas time. Pancho Villa. We gotta start helping our gente get out of here. You should be ashamed. Quit looking at boobs. Look at a boob tube, compliments from El Mero Mero. My BGA brothers. Pockets! Gotta get rid of that natural look, go back to processing. - You'll look like me, vato, huh? - Hey, how about those Raiders, chump? It's gonna be two-for-one, bro. Two for me, and one for you! Hey, man, don't talk to me about credit. I got debts as thick as a phone book. Now that Mosca and Flaco are getting transferred down to Chino... we'll have a base close to the courts in Los Angeles. Give 'em some money so they can set up a legal fund. - Recruit some soldiers. - You got it, jefe. Come on! This is my parole picture, huh? Hey! You only get paroled once, huh? Magic. Something to remember you by. All right. Okay. Here we are now. All right, vato. Take a picture. Oh, come on. Hey, I got people waiting. Ready? You know, I grew up about ten blocks from here, but this place blows my mind, Carmen. It looks like Hawaii, man. My father planted this 40 years ago. Created the whole Yucatan right here. Carmen's the best chef in all of East Los. - Is that right? - Uh-huh. Suck on this liquorice stick. It's been dipped 20 times to make you hump all night long, Paco. With you two around, I ain't gonna need no marriage counsellor. - I like your style, Paquito. - I'll check it out. I know this shit is good, 'cause, like, the last batch you made... was dynamite, man. But the only trip is, I'm wondering if you can supply the quantity that I'll need, see? - I mean... - First the money. Then the honey. All right, look. You see my homey out there? You got nine more grand. Now show me yours. Get him a caja. - Okay. - Make sure not to shake the baby food. PCP is very explosive. Boom! I'd hate to lose such a handsome customer. Mmm, Mommy. That feels good. You might need it for later, hmm? So did you really make this stuff? You a chemist? I worked in a medical lab. Hey, baby. Have you ever had a threesome? What's the matter? Too much for you? No, I just like business before pleasure. - He's a fucking cop! - Rollie, get in here now! You son of a bitch! No! No! You killed my baby! My... - Oh, it's PCP! Don't breathe! - Motherfucker! Get this shit off of me! Oh, shit! We gotta get you to the hospital. No, no, no. Get me a hose! We gotta wash this stuff off. Don't breathe! - Shit. It's a bust, ese. - God damn it. We lost the fucking lab and Clavo's money. That pinche loan shark's gonna shit! How we gonna pay him back now? - We lost everything. - Mira, mira, there's Carmen, eh. - Come on, man. Turn around. - Who's that? - What? - Hey, she's signalling someone, man! - Hey, hey, Paco, get back here! - We gotta wash that stuff off you! - Draw in the perimeter! - Wilson, call it in! Block Mario in on the radar! - Police! Stop the car! Pull over the fucking car! Stop the car. Put your hands on the steering wheel right now and keep your hands up! - Let's go. Out of the car. - Careful, careful. You two, out of the car. Orale, that's a nice placa you got there, ese. You should be riding with me, not fucking with me, carnal. Don't you call me carnal, you piece of shit. I'm not your brother. Scumbags like you are killing off our kids. - What an example to set for the kids. - Listen, you motherfucking rat punk! I'm gonna put you and your rat clica back in the joint, you hear me? - You keep talking. You keep talking! - All right, all right, Paco. - Let's... Hey! Let's go. - Check the trunk. - Put some clothes on, man. - Hey, you got a warrant? - Check that trunk. - What do you think you are, bulletproof? - God damn it. Check it, Rollie. - Check the trunk. So you think I never seen an OD before? What's the matter? You don't recognize your own son? - Hey, fuck you. That ain't Hector. - No, Hector's only 11. That boy's 13. If your boss Savedra keeps manufacturing that shit, it'll put Hector in the cemetery too. but you still smell like chorizo, pig. This pig is the only thing standing between you and them... but you ain't gonna get through me, punk. I ain't no rata. Yeah, you're a rat. Get up. Go. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe my time here in this institution... has turned me completely around, and I'm very grateful. Now I think I can make it as a productive member of society. Mr Velka, isn't it true that you clique with La Onda... a group whose motto is "Blood in, blood out"... meaning you have to kill someone in order to become a member? I hung out with a group who were my friends from my old neighbourhood. Our reputation grew out of defence of each other, but that's not... that's it. Nothing more. They didn't even listen. They fucked me. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Miklo, and make something of your life. I don't ever want to see you in here again. This is my daughter. Look at her. Look at her! She was only six months old when I came here. She grew up without me. I don't even know her. - That ain't right, carnal. - No, it's not, but it's that way for too many of us. That's why your parole is so important. You've got to prove there's another way. You got a chance to do it. I don't. Right on, carnal. Right on. - Thank you. - You gotta start acting like somebody who deserves parole, carnal. Put it on the record. Earn your freedom on paper, ese. All they got in front of them is your jacket. You are your jacket, 'cause to them you're just a number. Everyone who enters the joint thinks he's a man, but you know what he really is? A number worth 30 grand a year. They want us to come back... and what's worse, they have us lining up to get in, ese. We gotta turn the system around. We gotta outthink them. Now, concentrate. Why do you deserve parole, Mr Velka? Sir, I've been in prison almost a third of my life. I've grown up here. I've learned to read and write here. I earned my GED. Mr Velka, this board's only concern... Sir, with all due respect, look at my record. I've worked hard to prove I deserve another chance. It's in there in black and white. Please give me another chance. Damn, ese, they're not that good, homes. That's the best thing I've tasted in nine years, vato loco. - Good to be home, carnal. - Right on, cachetn. Right on. - That rose won't bloom in the spring. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. No Baptist sermons, okay, homey? It takes away the pain in my back. The Lord can't. I tried praying. - You better still be painting. - You know it, homes. You know it. But it's different than before. More real. No, hombre. Famous Apartments? They ain't famous no more, ese. Orale, come stay with me, homes. - I got a studio. - Nah, I gotta stay here. Frank got me a place. And, besides, the parole board checks my address. Thanks, Cruzito. Any time, carnal, t sabes. You don't know how good it is to see you, vato. Vato Loco forever, carnal. Nobody home! Quiet outside! What the fuck's up with you? - Milkweed. - I made it. Hey, welcome to the barrio, homes. Hey, Smokey! Apache! Mudo! Hey, homes. See my hermano? Yeah, Carlos. Hey, he told me to tell your mom to send more coffee. - And make sure it's, um, TC. - Shit. She never sent me nothin'. Hey, yeah, put some clavo in it this time. Chata! Some coffee. So, uh, you got a place for me in this building, huh? Uh... Hey, you know, that didn't work out, homes. Tell him to suck his pipi. You can stay here, ese. It's the same address. - I even got you a good job. - You're supposed to have an apartment for me! Hey, just a fucking minute, Your Majesty! This ain't the joint with three hots and a cot. This is the streets, homey. You got no choice. The parole board calls the shots here. This is your address for at least three months. La Onda could do better than this. Yeah, Rico and Luis split after a month, man. I'm just hanging for my old lady and my kids. - What about Popeye? - Popeye's docking me for a third of my cheque, man. Everybody's getting clipped, man, to pay that loan shark Clavo. That's the dude that fronted the bread for the PCP lab. That's not the way it's supposed to be! - I burnt you on that one. - Truck's loaded. Can I get my cheque? No, Larry. No, no. Don't be that way. Larry, pettiness is an ugly thing. Won't be able to cash that till Monday. Company will do it for ten bucks. - All right. - So, Larry, what do you give me on the Lakers and Golden State? Three points? Come on, Larry. Kareem is crippled. Give me six points and Golden State. Come on. - What? - Barry's hand's hurt. He's Golden State's whole offence. Hang on, Larry. So? Kareem is injured. So is Nixon. Six points ain't enough. Listen, six points or no bet. Sorry, Larry. Sorry, Larry. All right. Who made you the expert? Put me down for 1,200. Yeah, 1,200, Larry. East Los has gotten really crowded. It is, man. Illegals pouring in from everywhere, homes. Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Panama. Donde sea, homes. Crossroad of the world, ese. A Latino world. - You seen Paco? - What? - You seen Paco? No, not since Juanito died. They don't want to keep the wound open, man. They don't want me around, homes. - That's cold-blooded, carnal. - Paco's a narc, homes. - He'll probably bust my ass someday. - Man, that's fucked up. - Detective Aguilar. - Detective! Big time. - Miklo? - Good guess. - Are you out? - Yeah, two weeks. - Well, why didn't you let me know, man? Hey, after nine years in the joint, it ain't easy to call a cop, ese. Listen, it's not me I'm calling about any, way, . It's Cruz. He's hurtin', man. He needs his familia. - He has no family. - That ain't right, Paco. - Vatos Locos forever, remember? - No, you know what I remember? The day they lowered my little brother into the ground. That changed me forever. And every time I see a junkie on the street, it just reminds me... how Cruzito pissed away his life and his talent. Yeah, well, think about it. I gotta get back to work. Hey,, hey,, carnal. How you doing, man? Is there anything I can do to help? Nah. If I'm gonna make it out here, it's gonna be me who does it. And I really want to, carnal. There's lots of chances to go the other way, believe me. - But I'm gonna make it, Paco. - Well, that's great, carnal. That's... That's great. - I need the keys to move the truck. - Wait a minute. Make sure all the tyres are out of them and to wash it down. So you know your hoops. What the fuck? Hey, gero. Fuck the world. Would you please get out of my bed? I gotta go to sleep. - Later, ese. - Get the fuck outta my bed! - I gotta go to work in the morning, man! - What the fuck you on, ese? Hey, just relax! What's up with you? That's my space, man. That's all I have! Hey, Gil, there's been some sort of mistake on my cheque. I'm $150 short. - I worked 20 hours overtime last week. - That's right. I'm gonna do you a favour and take 150 out 7 more times... till you pay back the money you stole. What? I've been totally straight with you, man! What are you talking about? You know, I try to give you cons a break. You see money, and you can't resist stealing it. That's a lie, man! I never stole from you, Gil. It wasn't me! You had the keys. You knew where the money was. What? I didn't... I didn't do anything. Wait a minute. 150 times 8 is 1,200, right? Right? You used my money to pay back your gambling debts? Huh? That's a cute story. Tell you what. I'm gonna call the cops. I'll tell them my version, and you can tell them yours, convict. Hey. I'll get you some extra overtime. Yeah, right. So much for the straight world. Fucker's got me by the balls. This is just to get you on your feet, ese. You know, later on you'll get something better, t sabes. Yeah, right. Maybe I can join the priesthood and get some of that tax-free Sunday money, huh? Ah, I was doing better than this in the joint. This just ain't worth it, ese. - Don't bother, milkweed. - There's no respect. Oy, e, open up! Ronald Reagan, asshole. Open up. - Who the fuck are you, pendejo? - Who the fuck are you? I live here, pinche huey, . My house. Hey, hey, hey. It's cool. It's cool. He's crashing here. Hey, Popeye, I told you no artillery in this place. - You wanna get these people out of here now? - Hey, go change a tyre, gero. - We're talking some heavy business here. - You ain't gonna make no deals in this place! - You're gonna fuck up my parole. - Come on, ese. Let's go. No, Cruzito. This is my house, damn it! Cruzito. Hey, Cruz. Where you been, ese? Where are those little four G's that you owe me? Oh, l-look, homes. I just gotta sell a couple of my paintings, ese. And me la ray, o, I'll get you your feria, homes. Paintings. That's right. At least you gave me some paintings, ese. This baboso still hasn't given me dick. Can you believe that? That's not what La Onda's about. I ain't paying you shit! Shut the fuck up, gero. I represent La Onda here. You represent yourself. You always did. Hey, Popeye, you been collecting? What about our share, homes? Fuck, popi! Me too! You told me you were broke, ese. Everybody's fucking broke. I didn't come here to listen to you chumps whine about nickels and dimes. I'm talking about copping a hundred grand. In Nueva York, I mean, shit, that wakes people up. - Anybody got a problem with that? - Hey, hey, no, no. - Hey, we got no problem with that, ese. - Then what's the bullshit? I'll do it. We'll do it. I got... I got Mudo out on the street right now. He's copping some wheels. And, uh... And, uh, we got the muscle. You just give us the plan. You got the muscle to jack yourself off. That's it. You better watch your back, Mr Retread Man. I'm gonna put you in fucking high heels again! Go ahead and make your move, motherfucker! I'll send you to hell with Big Al. I ain't got no time to waste on your wolf tickets, chump. You're right, kid. This chump can't even change his socks. He can't, but I can. - Hey, Clavo. Hey, hey. Wait a second. - What's the scam? - Oh! - I need a trigger man, white boy... not someone who just punches the clock. You wanna see who I am? Huh? - I don't give warning shots, cabrn. - We can do the money truck, or we can off each other. - M-Miklo, don't fuck around, ese. - Realthing. Miklo, this vato's big trouble. In the joint, I was hustling more money than that punk ever dreamed of. He was punching my time clock every day. What's the gig? The armoured truck at the Zody's Saturday night. A lot of cash. Popeye cleans his debt and... and gets ten percent. Armoured truck's a dumb deal. It's too dangerous. Not this one, smart boy. The driver's in on it. He's a customer, okay? Okay, we'll do it. But it's 50-50, and you wipe out Cruz's debt. Chale, homes. Don't get fucked up in this bullshit. - Stay straight, pendejo. - No sermons, ese, remember? This is who I am. So do we gift wrap this sucker for you, or do you walk away empty-handed? Sixty-forty. Realthing handles the cash. You come up with the guns and the car. Apache's driving. Me and Smokes will back up Realthing. Okay. I can deal with that. - You're gonna have to. - Hey, hey, hey. What about me, fucker? You're out of it, asshole. It's payback time, Popeye. I'm gonna take back my rent money, with interest. Let's have a drink, ese. Detective Aguilar? Delivery from El Tapayec. - I got you, man. I got you. One sec... I did. I did so. - No way. No way, man. - Check this out. Check this out. Manuel's special. - I knew it was you. Is this a nuclear accident burrito or what? Something to tide us over till lunch. Us? You mean you. The two of you. Hey, I'm an undercover cop, all right? I'm working on my character look here. - You're a fat undercover cop. - Does this look real or fake? Real, right? McCann. Oy, e, narco, you like busting dope dealers? Oy, e, pendejo, this is my lunch hour. Big deal going down tomorrow. The Zody's on Whittier. - Who is this? - Look for a blue Econoline van with 20 keys of coke inside. - You'll be on the 6:00 news. - Oh, yeah? Who is this? All I got to say is, shit goes down and we're sitting here without back-up, we're gonna be two sorry assholes, man. How many times have we done this and nothing's happened? Huh? A lot. Relax. Have... Have a doughnut. Have a doughnut. - I already have one. - Look, have another. Look at these. What a dick. "Dick" and "asshole." That's all you call me. What is my name, "Dick Asshole"? - Hey, hey. Blue Econoline van. Is that your guy? - I don't know. - Do you see a connection anywhere? - No. Looks like two Latino males in front, some more in back. I don't know how many. - Hmm. That's a lot of people for a dope deal. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Shit! They're ripping off the connection! They're going to take the money and the dope! No, no, there's an armoured truck! Shit! This ain't a buy. This is a heist, man! Call it in! - 211 in progress, Zody's on Whittier! - Look up! Look up! Come on! Smokey, I got you covered! Let's go! Shit! Apache, cover me! - Wait, pinche! - Apache, wait! Shit! They're heading south on Whittier! There's two of them! - Call it in! - Right! - It's me, carnal! - Miklo? What the fuck are you doing, man? - Give me the gun, carnal. - No fucking way, ese! Miklo, I can help you! Give me the fucking gun! I ain't going back, Paco! You owe me this one, Vato Loco! No! Miklo, wait! I can't! - Stop! Police! - Fuck you, Detective! Stop, or I'll shoot! Hey, Cruz, man... Huh? You painted it about 20 times. Hey, come on, tecato. Let's ride the horse. Hey, chale, Chuey. We got an intruder. Oh, shit, homes. It's John Wayne. Well, you're just a bunch of little chavalas... and I can whip the whole bunch of ya Chicanos! So, what you want, man? Not much, carnalito. Uh, hey, how are you? How you doing? - You know, things people usually say who care about each other. - Oh, s... After seven years of nothing, man? Not even a fucking greeting card. You want hospitality, homes? Hey, pues, there's a can of chinga tu madre right there on the table, man. Why don't you help yourself? "Hey, homes"? Did you say "Hey, homes" to Miklo, homes, before you shot him? - Hey, chill out, Chuey! - Hey, what was I supposed to do? He was a shooter in a robbery! I was doing my job! Nobody has the right to kill innocent people! No, you're a pinche vato vendido, puto! - Fucker! - Hey! - Ow! Ow! - Hey! Fucking relax! Hey! Hey, djalo solo! Fuck you! Fuck you, wimp! Hey, homes, you can't come here any more unless you're going to bust me! Who the fuck gave you permission to use my little brother in your paintings? I don't need permission from you! He's my carnalito too! Hey, don't you use Juanito as an excuse to wreck your life! You don't have that right! I don't have the right, huh? Fucking right I don't. You're fucking right I don't have the right. I don't... I don't have that fucking right. You want him out of my painting, joto? All right. All right, there he is! Take it, man! Come on! Juanito always loved me more than you, homes. You were always too much of a badass to love the little vato! Just like you are now. So much of a fucking badass, you kill your own people! No! Don't you ever say that to me again, Cruzito. I let you say that once... What the fuck? You gonna kick my ass? Well, icaiga! Let's get down! Come on! You're the badass! Well, come on, gabacho. You the law! Do your job! Do your fucking job! Look at this. Look at that. Must be from Quentin, huh? - Hey. Hey, he's the guy... - PCP bust. That's Popeye Savedra. Miklo's connected to him. It's your destiny, man. It's... It's like a wave nothing can stop. No, no, it's a lot more complicated than that. This is some heavy shit, all right? Everything is perfect. It's like your mother's love. is like you have no mother. It's absolute hatred, complete destruction. In other words, "You win it all or lose everything." Sweet bunch of guys. This big, fat pig Popeye, right here in the centre? He's gotta be their leader. - Hey, Aguilar! - Look at the way they're all grouped around him like that. Hey, Aguilar, that, uh, that con you blasted just got out of surgery. He's gonna be a whole lot easier to catch from now on. Nurse, could you give me a minute, please? Nurse? Por la Virgen, Miklo, I did not know that it would... Don't talk to me about the Virgen. Vatos Locos forever. That all died when you pulled that trigger. How did everything get so fucked up, man? The pinche badge, ese. You owe me, vendido! Who's the sell-out? You're telling me you're working hard going straight. The next thing I know you're pointing a.357 at me... and there's two guys dead on the ground. I would have given you anything, Miklo. But you... you can't just take away what I am. You chose the wrong side, ese. There's too many of us. You're gonna lose. No, uh-uh. See, I don't forget where I come from or who I am. That's what keeps me going every day. - You don't want to hear the truth, Paco. - What truth? This, La Onda? Is this your truth? Two-bit punks like Popeye Savedra with their PCP labs? Or you, robbing Zody's and killing innocent people? Well, if that's your truth, then you're right. I don't wanna hear it. Get out, puto! You're not my blood! I'm cutting you off like they did my leg. You don't exist for me any more. Miklo, orale, carnalito. What's up, ese? You're looking good, homey! Hey, Hopalong! You better tell Carlos he'd better stop fucking with my business! - You stay... - Pockets, not in public! - Ain't gonna let no junkie rip off my customers. - Velka, time to lock up! - It's the Bionic Man. - Hey, Carlos. - What's with the BGA? - Pay no mind to cheap conversation. They're just sore losers, ese. They're just flapping their crow wings. - Pockets is on the warpath, ese. - Oy, e, I can't help it if the customers know where the quality is. - He's been selling them baby powder. - I don't have all day, man. Let's take it in. Hey, Majito. Gonna be cellies, huh? Move over here. Let me get those cuffs. That's a badass pano, homeboy. You've been burnin' them quills, huh? You're getting good. It's yours. My "Home Sweet Home" picture, huh? At least this bum leg got me something. I get to work at the law library. What's all that mad-dogging between Carlos and the BGA? The vato's got one sweet cocaine connection. Hmm. And he's moving in on Pockets' customers. How did he connect? Nobody knows. But it's dynamite shit. Pure Bolivian flake. And Montana, he just stood by and watched Carlos jump in? Plata talks. Carlos is recruiting lots of soldiers and buying influence... on the council to try to neutralize Montana. Says it's his own personal trip, not Onda's. That's bullshit! Personal trips is what's fucking Onda up. I saw that out on the streets. We're cutting our own throats. It's too soon to be walking on it. It's a long way up, but there's no way they're gonna stick me... uh, my carnales. Your own cousin did that. - You should put a hit on that puto. - No, he's mine. His payback's gonna take time. I'm gonna make him sorry he ever fucked with my business. Hey, puto. What the fuck do you think you're doing, chorizo? Trying to jump-start your memory, punk. Turn your ass around. - Where the fuck is Popeye Savedra? - I ain't seen the vato. - He took off. - Yeah, right after Zody's, right? You were in on that, too, weren't you, Smokey, hmm? - How about these putos? You know 'em, don't you? - No. No way. Isn't that what that snake tattoo means? Hmm? Isn't that what that snake tattoo means? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, ese. I'll tell you what I'm talking about, pendejo. You're a two-time loser, Smokey. One more, and they're gonna lock you up for good. So you better tell me about Onda, or I'm gonna strap you down with the bitch. You'll never see the streets again! If I say anything, I'm dead meat. I ain't gonna tell you shit, ese! It's baby powder, baboso! You write down every word I say. Anything you don't understand, you ask. I will answer just once, so write it down. Precedents for habeas corpus, cruel and unusual punishment here. You're also allowed to help on Durham decree. How much can you charge for this? You do your homework, jailhouse lawyer... can make as much as any mid-level attorney on the street. I'm gonna live in here. - Jerry, I don't mean to be nosy, but I... - Then don't be. All right, what? What is it? I'm just wonderin', uh... You own all those hardware stores. How come you're in here? Eleven tons of Colombian weed, twelve keys of heroin... and a pilot that turned state's evidence. Big time. - Hey, Jer, I just want you to handle my ca... - All right, George. - Hurry up, Jerry. - Charlie, I didn't see your jacket here. You got an appointment? The name's Carlos. Remember, I'm paying you a lot of feria, ese. - You make an appointment, Charlie. - You should be working on my case overtime. Charlie! Cool out or get out. George? Table. Oy, e, Miklo. You could take your leg off and hook down some of the books from up top, ese. Hey, I'm just kidding, ese. Come here. Oy, e, come here, man. Okay, relax. I got the medicine to make you well, vato. Mira, if you're ever in any pain, homey, you just come talk to me. You should talk to El Mero Mero. Chale, think about the future, not the past. Montana's not God. Tomorrow at the council, I'm giving Onda a chance to move into the driver's seat. Don't be left behind, eh? Mira, I cut a sweet deal with the AV-ers. They'll supply me with all the dope I can move... just as long as I sell only to the blacks and the browns. What do you have to give in return to the polar bears? I gotta plug up the BGA pipeline, take 'em out of the dope business. It's simple. Me and my soldados can take care of Pockets in here. My brother Smokey, he can take out Cheap Times, their main supply joint down in L.A. All I need from the council is back-up. It's a sucker's deal, ese. The only thing the Aryans want is to start a war between black and brown. Chale, we've got a truce with the BGA. Why do you wanna play the chimp with these may, ates? The market is there. Cocaine is America's cup of coffee. Oy, e, check it out. I'm making so much feria right now... it's making Miklo's gambling book look like bubble gum change. We don't start wars to become dope pushers. You even addicted some of our own soldados to coca. We're supposed to protect our people, not destroy them. Look at his arms. He loves that shit more than he loves us. - It'll destroy La Onda. - Enough words! We've come all this way. You wanna go back to bumming cigarettes, ese? - Oy, e, you wanna shine shoes? - Ese, La Onda don't shine shoes. That's right, but that's what's gonna happen if we don't make our move now, ese! I wanna own the whole fuckin' store! Now are you with me? I say chale. You're not the leader here. I say Onda's not with you. You do what you have to do without us. 'Cause I ain't going back. I don't need Onda for this. Money buys my back-up. I'll get the polar bears to back my play. - Hey, carnal. - No, ese. Carlos, come back! Jefe, we can't let him go. We can't let him split up Onda. Carlos! Can't you see Montana's stupid for letting Charlie walk? Onda's committing suicide. - Fuck you, Jerry! - Fine. I thought you wanted to learn something. Listen, Charlie's a businessman. He broke some serious business rules. Not only did he get strung out on his own shit... but he moved on BGA clients when he didn't have to. - Is that right? - Yeah, that's right. You know, I see the jackets of most of the cons that come in here. Eighty percent of them... Eighty percent of them are drug cases. You know why? Because everybody out there's doin' it. Doctors, lawyers, housewives. Cocaine is America's cup of coffee. You were Carlos' connection. He said the same "cup of coffee" line exactly. You were supplying him. You're pissed 'cause he's doing business with the AV-ers now. Last year, California passed a flat-time law for drug offenders. You know what that means? That means they have it worse than anybody... murderers, rapists, anybody. There's no parole, no good time. That's a lot of guys that are gonna be here for a real long time, all drug users. - Can you see the potential? Can you? - Yeah. Anyone who can accommodate that appetite... can control this joint and every other joint. Dwell on it. Drive it. Drive it, Ryder. Here's your pill briefs. Jerry said it'll take at least three months for the court to respond. Well, well, well, Lightning. Our favourite spic lover has come home. I knew he'd be back. It's overdue. You hear that, Lightning? The cripple here wants to collect your gamblin' debts. Yeah, well, I might think about it, if he'll show me his falsie. - Come on, cripple, show me your stump. - Little white Mexican boy... came all the way back just to show us his stump. - Hold his fuckin' leg. Come on, man. Stand still. - Get off me, motherfuckers! Too many britches on. Stay still, God damn it, I said! You gotta be crazy to pull this shit, Lightning! - He must be laughin' in his grave, cripple. - Get off, you fuck... - No, leave it alone! - Stay still, God damn it. - There she is. - Fuckin' puto! You ever heard that old saying, "Put your foot in your mouth"? Spit-shine that shoe, boy. You fuckin' polar bears are gonna pay, believe me! Carlos works for us now, and every day he brings more Onda soldiers with him. You greasers better wise up. It's a white world. The coloureds are here to serve us. From now on... you're gonna be my personal errand boy. - You motherfucker! - Fuckin' punk. Go out for a pass, cripple. Come on. Go deep. Now you're back to your true nature, boy, crawlin' on your belly like a worm. - They put it in my face! - You have to understand, your leg is gone, Miklo. You can no longer be a soldier. That's why I put you in the library. It's not what they did to me. They got no respect for Onda. We should never have given up Carlos. You think I wanted to? Carlos fucked up, bad! I'm not saying he didn't, but he was right about the drugs. Whoever controls them controls everything. You ever seen an old drug dealer, Miklo? They don't exist. the majority in the pintas in the Southwest. What good is it if we're a bunch of fuckin' slaves workin' for the BGA and the AV-ers? We gotta attack now! We gotta take power! The best of us ending up in pools of blood... for a pinche pack of smokes and a snort of coca! I don't know where you're comin' from, bro. A Chicano from Cal State got them to publish my essay on prison reform. They want me to write a book on the Chicano in prison. You better lift your eyes outta this book, jefe. You better see what's goin' on around us now. Wind it up, gentlemen! Take it to y, our houses. Let's go. Move it. No can do, carnal. Quarter of the bill I can take care of maybe. Indugu, you forgot your comb, man. Maybe. Thinks he's gettin' away with something. Tootin' his horn to a fairy tale. Hey, Magic. Help me out. You mad-dog me, you better watch your back, homes! Now the fuckin' AV-ers won't pay on their bets either. Why pay? They were testing us with Carlos and we folded. Now they're gonna take us apart piece by piece. Whether we like it or not, the dope business is where it's at, Magic. If the AV-ers and the BGA-ers control it, they control everything, including us. Fuckin' A, ese. Carlitos was right. No, he was stupid for selling out to the AV-ers. Onda should take the money left in the gambling book and make a buy. - Yeah. - I know a connection. But the council won't approve it. We should do it anyway. - You wanna die, ese? - If I have to, I will! I lost my fucking leg, my family back home. This is all I got left. If we don't do something now, Onda dies. Do you want that? Magic, I love Montana too... but I'm not gonna stand by and watch them destroy us. Will you stand with me, carnal? Right now there's only two of us, so we gotta lay back and wait for an opening. The Aryan Vanguard's gonna force Carlos to make his move soon on the BGA. - I told you to stop branchin', punk! - I said next! - I said move. Let's go. - Better watch your back, 'cause I'm gonna ride you. You're right. I don't want any trouble. I've changed my ways. Now I'm takin' all your customers. Say anything, and you're dead! At the same time he hits Pockets... his brother Smokey will move on Cheap Times, the BGA's drugstore down in L.A. Hey,, hey,, hey,, hey, She's a super freak Super freak She's su... Brought you monkeys some coconuts... from Quentin! The only problem is, Carlos is so strung out... he can't see the wolf in the henhouse. If I know Red Ryder, as soon as Carlos does the AV-ers' dirty work... they'll pull his protection, and it'll be open season on Carlos Zuniga. Carlos! No! - Move, move, move! - If I'm right, all hell's gonna break loose. That's our chance, Magic. Where there's war, there's opportunity. What we gotta do is wake Montana up and move Onda into power. Montana, nosotros estamos muriendo. Que ellos peleen contra el BGA. No! Listen! Before we fuck up everything we built, I have to have a meeting with the BGA. We're making a horrible mistake. Can you understand that? - What, are you blind or what? - Wait a minute! I said I want you ready! I'm not gonna waste the lives of our soldados for nothing! The time to strike is now! If we wait, they'll destroy us! No, Magic! We gotta back El Mero Mero. If he says meet with the BGA, we gotta do it. What are you talking about? If we stand by, we're gonna watch Onda go down in flames! Magic, tenemos que darnos esquina. I want you to hit Smokey! I want him dead by tomorrow! Geronimo, dile a tus soldados que se calmen. Three more California prison inmates have been killed in gang violence... bringing the tally, of fatalities this week to 11. Aguilar! - Aguilar. - Hey, chorizo. You still want Popeye Savedra? - Zuniga? - They got a hit on me. I need protection or I'm dead. Listen, Smokey, if you want protection, you're gonna have to give me more than Popeye. I want everything on Onda. Who they are and where they are. - Hey, no way, forget about it! - Hey, don't talk shit, Smokey. You stay out there alone, you're dead. You said so yourself. All right! All right. I'll give it to you. The whole lay, out... capitanes, soldados. - Where can we meet? - St Mary's Church, Fourth and Chicago. - I know it. - Be there in 15 minutes, chorizo, or forget about it. I'll be there. Quiet in the church. Aguilar? This is Lieutenant Ivan Burnett. He's from San Quentin. - Detective Paco Aguilar. - How're you doin'? - This the victim? - Yeah. - Paco, we just heard from Sacramento. We are to cooperate with Corrections on this. That means that Burnett's gonna be bringing down his entire team. - What does that mean? I'm out of it? - You heard me. Well, this is bullshit, Captain. Well, come on, I've been working on this case for months. This vato was about to give me the full lowdown on Onda. What do you know about Onda? I had a run-in with a couple of these guys here. - The whole council. Captain, I'll need this picture. - Fine. - My chief investigator will debrief him tomorrow. - Hey, wait a minute, man. That's my evidence. This is an East L.A. case. Look, I appreciate your interest, but this is much bigger than East L.A. Things are popping up all over the state. You hear about the grenade that was thrown into... the Cheap Times Social Club in Wilmington last night? I'm betting that Zuniga here was the quarterback. Part of a plot started by his brother in Quentin. - It all comes outta Q - All right, all right, Lieutenant. Let's get inside. This is happening here, not in San Quentin. It's all tied up to prison gangs. Now, it's very complicated. That's why we're taking over. Do you speak Spanish? You ever been in a street gang? No, but my warden has, and he's Chicano. Well, is your warden related to someone on the Onda council? Miklo Velka is my... is my cousin. I am related to him by blood and by this. Look, Lieutenant, I don't mean any disrespect... but I think I can get further on this thing than you can. All I'm asking is that I'm involved. Thank you. This was a personal thing between Carlos and Pockets. Carlos and Pockets were loose cannons. That was business. But what you all did in L.A. night before last was bullshit. There's gonna be more blood on blades than broken bones... 'cause we ain't lettin' y'all hit us in the back no more. Now, you wanna powwow? You wanna talk? Go ahead, talk. Onda had nothing to do with Cheap Times. Carlos' brother Smokey acted on his orders, not Onda's, and he's paid the price with his life. Cheap Times made for cheap lives, man, lots of'em. You want a war? We're ready. Believe me, we'll win. We've got more soldiers, and they'll go all the way... to the death if they have to. I've got soldiers. My soldiers are ready to die. We've done proved that. Is that what you want? I guarantee that's what the Aryans want. We can stop the killing now. You and me, right here. Now, your word means something here. What about Folsom and Chino? - I speak for them too. - Mm-mmm. Maybe for Soto or Folsom, but your word ain't reachin' to Chino right now. Mosca Lopez is crazy. I done lost three people down there. I can ask the warden for a temporary transfer. He might agree if you guarantee peace while I'm gone. Fuck a truce! We cannot... Five days. Miklo will coordinate Onda business in my absence. You can trust he'll make sure nothing happens while I'm away. So do we have a truce? - Right on. - Well, well, well. You now have a combined IQ of two. - You're a dead man, Wonder Bread! - Why don't you kiss my enriched white ass, motherfucker? This here's my coon dog. Get them coons, boy. - Red Ryder, what's goin' on? - Don't ask me what's goin' on, man! Ask us, "What are we doin' here? Is there a war?" - Yeah! - We'll run 'em outta the goddam banks! - Save the taxpayers some money. - All right, gentlemen! Let's clear the yard now! It's between the niggers and the spics. We're white, white, white, you motherfuckers! You're a jailhouse lawyer, a counsellor. He knows you'll follow my wishes. But what if he's lying? What if the BGA doesn't want peace? Nobody in here knows what peace is. They've never had it. I'm talking about power, carnal. The only way for us to gain real power is for black and brown to come together. Huh. And I thought Popeye Savedra was the leader of Onda. It's hard to buy it's the little guy down there. You better believe it. He's got what you call charisma. You really think he can do something to stop the violence? Montana's got something that makes you wanna listen to him. Got a lot of heart. If anybody can stop this war, it's him. I can always bring in the guns, but I'd rather it be him. I don't like you travelling alone. I don't trust the administration. I don't trust anybody. Don't worry. The warden's guaranteeing my passage. Top-secret route. I made a deal with the vato. I get to spend the night in Delano, see my daughter. After 14 years. Can you believe it? Come on, Segura. Move it. You got it. - What time's my daughter coming? - She'll be here about 7:00 sharp. We'll rack you at 6:00 tomorrow for a shower. I'll be waiting. - Name's Wallace. - Montana. Say, amigo, you ain't got no street smokes, do you? This state tobacco, man, it'll kill you. I don't smoke. You don't smoke, huh? Man, I can't wait for these son of a bitches to let me outta here... Do me some pickin' so I can send my old lady some money back in Louisiana. - I used to pick a little when I was a kid. - Huh. Me, I've been followin' this crop all my life. If it ain't that, I takes me a little drink. If it ain't that, they got me behind bars tryin' to dry out. You ever pick any grapes, Wallace? No, I ain't never picked no grapes, but I done cut me a bunch. Yeah. - Here. - Oh, man. Is it... Is it... Say, a-amigo, do you mind any if I have, uh, two? Ah, keep the pack. They're only for trade. - Oh, man. - Lights out. You know, when I was a kid, I used to love to pick. Nothin' like fresh vegetables and fruit ripe from the vine. Yeah. Mmm. Okay, the escort's on his way. You'll have one hour with your father. - Let's go! - I'd like a couple of seconds to straighten up. I don't care who you are in San Quentin. You're nobody here in Kern County. Can I just take a couple of seconds to straighten up? Please? I'm gonna put your daughter in the visiting room. You've got one hour. The clock is ticking. One hour. I'll be right back. Morning, Montana. Good morning, Wallace. See they botherin' with you early in the mornin', huh? Nah. It's... It's a good day. I'm not gonna let anything ruin it. Ooh, them damn short-handle hoes. Yeah, I used a few of those myself. Oh. Oh. Here, amigo. Why don't you use this? Yeah, well, I'll hold it for you. Thank you. Yeah, chingo de tiempo since I felt this good. - Huh? - My daughter's coming today. - Oh, man, today is gonna be such a good day for you. - Yeah. Your daughter's gonna be so proud of you. Uh-huh. Now, this is what they call "a change of plans." For Cheap Times! For Cheap Times! Son of a bitch. Motherfucker, think you can blow up my brother? Uh-uh. You can go join your maker now, for what falls to the floor is his. Don't forget your smokes. How'd you know he was in Delano? How'd you know the head of La Onda was there? Man, I do not give a good goddam who that taco-eatin' motherfucker was. Oh, who that taco-eatin' motherfucker was? Do you know who you killed, asshole? Your mama. - We're gonna stay here. - Nope. He's been in for 30 years. He's as tough as three-inch steel. - When I get back, I'm gonna bust your ass. - I'll be here. Come in here. Yeah, that's the man. That's the one who ordered it. Bring him in here. - Tell him what you told me. - I didn't order no hit on nobody. Don't bullshit me, man. I ain't no sucker. He's BGA. He made the hit. He's your man. I ain't tryin' to play you for no sucker, brother. I'm just tellin' you, if I wanted to hit Montana, I use a freelancer. An AV-er, so it couldn't be traced. I'm not a stupid man, son. That's enough. Come on over here with me. - Is that your man? - Yeah, that's him. - Why don't you let me talk to him? - No way. He ain't gonna tell you nothin'. Do you wanna get to the bottom of this problem? You wanna deal with it? Now, I know he'll talk to me. Your call. Goddam. The man got you down here too? Yeah. Look here. Why you hit Montana? Oh, I dig. The man got his eyes and ears in the wall. Don't sweat, brother. I'm gonna maintain. Who ordered the hit? You did. You did. With your kite you did, man. - You did. I got your kite, man. - I didn't send you nothin'. - Fu... You did, man. - Who ordered it? You did. I got your comb. I kn... I know your design. - You got my comb? - Yeah, I got your comb. I opened it up. I read the message. I burned it. It was your comb, man! The warden let me come in here to talk to you about Montana's murder. Who the fuck are you to come here like this? Montana's none of your fucking business. You've gotta listen to me, Miklo. - The BGA didn't do it. - That's bullshit. - We know the fucking BGA killed him. - Yeah? Well, the administration doesn't think so. And what if they're right? You wanna be responsible for starting a fucking war against the wrong people? Huh? Listen, man. I know you hate me. I shot your leg off, and that's something I'm gonna have to live with for the rest of my life. But you're still my blood, and I'm not gonna stand here and watch you destroy yourself. If you start this war, you and your vatos will be committing suicide. Now look over there. You see the warden? Do you want that? Ah, you're the man now, aren't you? Look, Montana left you in charge, right? Be a real leader, man. I'll meet him in the yard. One lieutenant each. No guards around. That's far enough. Let 'em go on their own. I swear to you, it wasn't the BGA. Montana was a stand-up dude. We were set up. That old man was no jive-ass punk. He was hard-core BGA. That's right. That's why it don't make no sense. I take out Montana with my own man? That's suicide. Now, you do what you wanna do, but think about this: Who you think stands to gain if BGA and Onda war? The fuckin' AV. Oh, yeah, they want us to take each other out. Then they step in and take over everything. We go back to bein' slaves. The AV-ers. They're the only one who could've gotten Montana's route from the white guards. Right? I work with Lightning in the wood shop. He gets my comb, he counterfeits it, he sends it to Wallace. - It's possible. - And now that motherfucker Red Ryder... sittin' in a front-row seat just waitin' on us to take each other out. So what do you propose? I say whip those motherfuckers together. We do to them what they tryin' to do to us. You see those pinche vultures? They're watching us with a magnifying glass right now. So for the next six months, we'll practise a good-neighbour policy. So we got a deal? We join forces? Yeah. And we'll celebrate a big Mexican holiday together. Now, which one you talkin' about? - That means what now? - Day of the Dead. - All right. - Right. - In six months. - My man. They're shakin' hands. We got a truce. We won't congratulate ourselves too soon. We'll wait and see. - I don't trust that dude. - No, no, no. This boy's in way over his head. He ain't got no choice but to go with us right now. We help them take out the AV-ers, we're making the may, ates stronger, ese. It's okay, carnal. When you expect nothing and you get everything, that's destiny. The BGAwants to help us take out the AV-ers? All right. We'll throw a little white meat to the dogs. Then we'll rob the house. - You were right. - You did the right thing, Miklo. - Tell your mom I love her, okay? - Take care of yourself, all right? Yeah. Juanito, Juanito. Hey, homes. If anybody messes with you, ese... I'm sorry, ama. - I loved Juanito. - I know, mi hijo. I loved him, ama. I'm sorry. I missed you, mi familia. She put the handcuffs on. Two days later I come back, she's got eye hooks drilled in the door. She's got thongs. I swear to God. She absolutely loved it. She became orange... You got it. Yeah. One more. Come on. One more. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! No more! No more, man. I'm through, okay? That's it. Ten cents a fuckin' hour, that spic warden ain't gettin'... a nickel's worth of overtime outta me. Hey. Hey, hey, hey! What the fuck is wrong with you goddam people? Are you... God damn it, you stupid fuckin' asshole! You got it in my eyes! Lousy... Now, everybody keeps their mouth shut. You understand me? This way, there won't be no problem with nobody when the shit go down. - That way we control the whole joint, right? - All right. Come on, you want some of this? You want some of this? Who do these punks think they are? Look at this. It's unbelievable. Every hit was strategic. I don't like being lied to. I want the Onda council broken up. Use interstate compact. I want them out of here. Get them out of here before the end of the week. Taxpayers just saved another three million bucks. Everything's a fucking joke to you, man. What's your problem? What's my problem? You got a problem! No, no, no, you don't understand, man. That little bastard's up there playing God, and he's got an army to back him up. Yeah, I don't understand, right? I don't ever understand, right? Well, as long as he's doing it behind bars, it's not gonna affect you or me, is it? - Is it? - Oh, it's not gonna affect us. It won't affect any of us, will it? You used me. I tried to save your life, and you used me to set up the BGA. I did what I had to for my brothers to survive. Your brothers! And what am l, Miklo? Man, you grew up with me. You slept in my room. You wore my fuckin' clothes. How could you use your own flesh and blood to help massacre all those people? I didn't want to hurt you, Paco. In here you use what you've got. Without your help, a lot of carnales would have died. Don't you thank me. I hate what you did. I hate what you stand for. You know, Paquito, for a long time I hated you. I blamed you for everything. But then I realized something that changed my life. Everything you did, even shooting my leg off... forced me into my destiny... Here. Inside these walls, I've found the strength of La Raza. You got no fucking idea what La Raza means. It's about our people out there... working, surviving with pride and dignity. That's La Raza. Not lying and murdering. All you got is your white father's hate. Still hung up on my fluorescent skin, vato? Hmm? He wasn't my real father. Montana was. He taught me about respect. You gotta be willing to die for it. Like you. Like you not deserting me after the car crash at El Pino. That was real respect for a brother. And I'll always love you for it, carnal. We should help each other, not cut each other's throats. Let's be brothers again. Just because you're a cop and I'm a con doesn't mean we can't cooperate. I can give you tips from inside that can really help you out on the street. You got a lot of power out there, man. Your guidance and advice would be invaluable to me. What are you asking me, to be a member of your gang? Are you out of your fuckin' mind? You remember how we took out Spider for Cruz? Together, Paco, we're unbeatable. Your Onda's not my onda, and it never will be. Paco! I'll always be your brother, Vato Loco. Never. - They're watching, homes. - I know they are. Let 'em watch. The show's just beginning, and they don't even know it. This will probably be our last meeting together, carnales. They're trying to break Onda up. But you know what? They're only helping us grow. They're using the interstate compact to exchange each of you who's from out of state... for cons from Califas. So, Chivo, they're sending you back to Arizona. Hey, man, we can't do nothin' about it. You gotta go. But at least you'll be back to your mom, man. She needs anything, let me know. I'll take care of her. Geronimo goes back to Texas. You straighten your son out. They're trying to break up La Onda, but we're gonna turn it on 'em! And you know how we're gonna do that? Each of you is gonna establish your own chapters. La Onda has $15,000 for each of you, so you'll start things out strong. We're gonna spread La Onda gospel Billy Graham style. Yeah, s. Que no, homey. El Mero Mero had a dream. We are that dream. We're gonna multiply in numbers undreamed of... in every pinta, every barrio, every southwestern state. La Onda has a destiny, and no one can stop us. What about me, carnal? - Where do I go? - You stay with me, carnal. You're the eyes behind my back... the leg I don't have, the other half of mi corazn. You ordered me to destroy this mould. But I kept it for protection from you. Now I want you to destroy it. - I loved him. - We both loved him. But we did what we had to do for Onda. You were right. I give my life to you. What are we doing here? - Come on, man. - Man, you got me out of bed to come down here? Think you lost more than your hair, vato. Don't believe all that shit you hear about Samson, ese. I'm just strippin' myself down to the bone, homes. - Yeah, what if I said I wouldn't come? - Shit, I knew you would come. Come look at yourself in the mirror, ese. Oh, man. It's not all marked up, man. It's a sign of respect. For ten years, man, I've been star trekking in the twilight zone. Damn, we were all innocent, eh? It's all gone, Cruzito. It ain't like that any more. What, not even a little carnalismo left in there, ese? What, you think you use brotherhood up like a shot of tequila? You just drink it down, it burns, it makes you feel good, yeah? And then you're left with the hangover the rest of your life? Look, man, you showed me your mural. You're a good artist. I think you're the best. Now, come on. Let's go. Hey, just 'cause you wear sunglasses don't mean you're blind, ese. Oh, shit. You want to know what I see up there? A fantasy, man. A dream. Three vatos looking for something that wasn't there. Loco, we stood by each other. We trusted each other. Orale, that's worth believing in. Shit, we were familia, homes. He ain't my family. I hate that fuckin' puto. You ought to scrape his ass off the wall like dirt. Chale, vato, no matter how much hate there is between you and him... you're still connected. You got the same blood pumping through both your hearts, ese. That's a bond you can never break. Neither can Miklo. - He's still just trying to be like you. - That's bullshit! Simn, ese, come on! El Gallo Negro, the baddest Chicano in the barrio. Yeah, well, that ain't me. Not any more. You ain't changed a bit, ese. Oh, so, what... what are you saying? It's all my fault, the way everything turned out? Oh, I see. What, you think you got so much fucking power, huh? Control everybody's destiny? - No, you're right, man. - No, I'm not. - I set Miklo up. I made him go after Spider. I mean, I started the whole fucking thing. Relax, ese. Your back wouldn't be all fucked up. Miklo wouldn't be in prison. He'd still have his leg. - Hey, I forgive you, ese. - I don't want your forgiveness, man! You know, that's your fuckin' problem, ese. You can't forgive yourself. You need that guilt. It's what keeps you going. Hey, I know, bro. I fed mine through a needle for ten years! And that gero up there, hating his own fucking white skin? Shit, he's got it worse than both of us. You gotta cut it loose, carnal. It's fucking poison. That's who we are. Three Vatos Locos full of carnalismo... trying to survive in a fucking war zone. But what I know now, bro, is that I need my familia to do it. We all do. Even you, pinchejura. Badass cop. - Come on, man. - Hey, don't back away, vato. Life's a risk, carnal. Remember? You said it yourself. Step into the ring and throw down, ese. You a badass? Take care of business, homes. 'Cause we're from East Los, ese. We come out chased by hounds, huh? 'Round and 'round we go, wearing a pinche rabbit's foot for luck... just ahead of the fucking hounds. Yeah! Hey. We got something better than a rabbit's foot, homes. We've got familia. Hmm? You know what I'm sayin', ese? You may be bad, but you can't dance like Smooth Cruz. Oh, I see now. I remember you, vato. El merengue at the Tender Trap, '72. Rucas got their hearts broke, and I kicked your ass. Shit. Oh, shit, man. I was breaking hearts and faces, vato. Bullshit! You still can't dance, ese. You still can't dance. Yeah, but you can learn, ese. I'll teach you, simn. 'Cause it ain't ever over, homes. Ever!
