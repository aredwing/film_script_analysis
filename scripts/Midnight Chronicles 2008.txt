They shall be called to a place of secrets forgotten by time and shadow. There they shall set in motion events that will shake the foundations of the earth and the heavens. "The Tale of the Black Wave" Here I am. Here freedom. Dorosul! Show me. It hurts? It was. My faith is gone, I'm not coming back. Shadow can not grab with your hands, as the Legate could not abandon their vocation. Why are you doing this? You belong to him forever. Amusing. I return you to Izrador. Many years ago, the dark god Izrador was cast out of heaven and sent to the ground. Since his fall, a wall, separates heaven from the death, separates gods from their creations. Izrador, bearing the name North shadow gathered around him the evil and dark forces. He started a war against Free Tribes. Led by the Queen of Arad, free Tribes passed Izrador attack. But Izrador not lost. The third war the dark god has made another attempt to capture to which free tribes were not ready. At this time, the god of darkness won. Seizing the land his iron hand, ...sent Izradorean priests and the servants run possessions from the city of Teros Obsidiya. There was the era of the eclipse, the magic and hope had disappeared from the world. Hundreds of years passed with As long as the shadow fell. MIDNIGHT CHRONICLE Calm down? Maybe even posovetuesh meditation? No you are not forced to wait This smelly little people all day long. We suffer to shadow gained force. We followed this skitaltsem half way to Eredlander. Two weeks enjoyable Rest - this is not enough? Holiday? Happy holidays. Another night, Kruce. And we back to the Teros Obsidiya. I do not know. This is who? So far from the tower, Chuzara? Geddon world pays you, Meg. I would like to speak with him personally. And this is who? We do not like you? Forget, Kruce, its honesty - it was good. Although sometimes inappropriate. You go with me Blekuir, it is necessary to build the temple. Mandeyn on the side rescuer. Do not you think? I am surprised that Geddon ... And to know the fate of Tosh Kamara, Legate disappeared. Sunny. What happened the night there, Meg? Meg? Prophecies of the northern Land exaggerated, Geddon. The Legate does not take them seriously. Sanulel not mistaken. Never. Still, some in Consulate think in another way. Do not miss any of the threats which would it not seem incredible. Ok. But this prophetic tale of the hero, who is alleged to rise up against us - this foolishness. Sorry, I must prepare for the trip. Because of missing Legates and not a news? Do you have other responsibilities, Haarn? Tosh Qamar has been sent to the temple about five years ago, Geddon. Our time is running out. You can refer Sanulelu that the fate of Tosha Camara will soon be known, and the temple Blackweir will be completed. Excellent. He pleased. May I know who you are sent to this task? New envoy. He will not let me. Who are you? Servant of the darkness. Open the gate. Take what you would burn unnecessary. Four wagon products. He once again for their own. Yes. This is not to argue. They say the mayor arrest you. Rather, we are. For the high taxes. Anyone in Blackweir understand that the mean charges Lesher. Better to pay it, than to see in its territory a new church. You know best. It would not know. Now go. You always give me in the best seats, Meg. At his death, I will know Each dung pile in the west Kaladruna. Kruce you at any time you can go from me, unlike the rest of the servants, then I will be bored without you and these spectacular destinations. Kruce, not each time job leads gentlemen in raptures. Score one job! Which will lead to a small joy, or at least to a place which does not stinks rybimi giblets. Honestly, I love the smell of fish. I will perform assignments Geddona. And if playing on Geddon pipe, we must dance. Yes, we find that a Legate, just do not want to bury their talents. Yes what talent? Write to the saddle? Prisluzhnitsa deign joke? Honey, I'm talking about intuition. Feeling unnatural. And, believe my inner feeling, nastily in this place definitely should be tavern. Sorry, I thirst torments. We are awaiting trials. You know, my dedication perfect, so if I am to you ponadoblyus, seek me in the tavern, fortifying myself with something beautiful in obnimku. Or maybe two. Pig. I know how few are those who returns lost me. I am afraid, I taught you ungrateful occupation, Meg. You taught me that the entire Glory belongs to the dark north. Taught to learn the name of the victim. That's all. Haam believed that age dulls my ability ... I hope you dokazhesh him that he is mistaken. Wait! There is no character what you Legate. I do not know what it is. Do not know? That was last winter. I am afraid to contact physician. Savior - and suddenly afraid of? Well, yes. Do not let yourself, Meg. Discuss this when the return. How can you say. Beirial. This castle is not abandoned. Legate claims possession. Even after his death. Soul? I find the rest. We stayed in this place. There is something else. Something old. Something strong. What did he say? There are many spirits. Scared. But Tosha Camara do not see. Offer besiege dessiatinas farm near the village of Ferngleyd. The collection of tithes from the forest villages had terrible consequences. I hope this "hunter" not asked you to hide the true number of deaths in the village. That would be a mistake if you know what I mean. Iana? Iana! I can not speak, Gaelen. Do not walk behind me. How many years old. I will not let you disappear again. Go away, Gaelen. Doros garuk. I came into the darkness that release you from to use. Especially Ishar nosfo. Doros Auchan. I praise this place. Berash! Return, fly into the darkness north. They went to Izradoru. This temple is now mine. What could help mayor city chief architect? I requested not to come here. Someone came. Someone? Legate. From the tower. You said that there was no priests from the tower would not. I do not think that this ordinary priest Lesher. Perhaps we have too long delayed construction of the temple. I am afraid that our explanation not work. Maybe we should ... This Legate took you all the courage, Dolan? I assure, if you dash me a reason to doubt in thee, so be it. How many more chickens endure your farm? My farm - this is not your business. Reshu when it is finished. And you reported to me about all the caravans that come to the temple. But most importantly, Dolan - silent. With this Legate, I investigate myself. Can you ask? Ask, but do not promise to reply. How many have you killed? You mean Legates-traitors? ??????? Eight. I killed eight. What you feel when kills a Legate? When someone refuses to darkness, it becomes white as the light Since then he no longer Legate. What do you see in the flames, Deleth? Just flame. That's all. How can you say. The attack was successful? Where the remaining elves? Your comrades. They returned to Karadul. We bring your supplies. But since you left. I have another job. Here? In Blackweir. As there may need to elves? Forget. There is one thing that you should know. Another Legate has arrived in Blackweir. This is bad news. Are you sure? You saw him? It has been many years since As long as I did. Sometimes, before the storm, I again his feelings, his call, his signs. And feel it now. There is a prophecy, Chuzara. Predicts the arrival of the enemy in this latest era. The enemy is very dangerous for our lord. Grozny warrior. Written that the earth itself moans sing out his name. You did not say anything. Who is it? Old friend. Sorry. Friend. Everything in the village believe that you are dead. My mother still makes your candle every spring. Life is unpredictable, Gaelen. The easiest way to go. Remains the same - difficult. Much more difficult. But this is life. Live, standing in a queue to pay tithe tower. Life, as it fear in anticipation of monsters? You call this life? This is what we have. Gelen, why did you went after me now? Why not go then when I wanted? My parents raised you. You want me to leave them? How many sleepless nights I spent, thinking that you go with me. I so want this. I can not. I led the mayor of the city and the chief architect. Welcome to Blackweir. Lesher Noga, serve you. Lyubueshsya beauty Krolis? Need to depart? Is she here? She was a Legate. Then it's true. Tower again stretches its long arm in the slot Lesher. I wonder whether she knows about the snakes, who live in its walls. Where have you bought this book? Some things are not bought. If the Legate notice it, we end. What do you want, the magistrate? To begin to explain how killer owns the art of writing, although this is prohibited. Lesher teaches? - Be careful. - It is a threat, Krolis? Yes. Darkness would be, Krolis. This is inevitable. Do you think Lesher remain in Blekuire when everything happened? You're very confident in the outcome. Wind changes, Krolis. Think to be faithful, to how is your "book" will be burned. And you along with it. Do not mention the word "book" before the Legate. What is the Legate? Legates are different, but this I have not seen it. I syta on your throat cowardice. From fear of you has. Are you not afraid? Soon all know that we have done. Stories of ghost Blackweir, Dolan -- it is not just a fairy tale at night. I know. So please be patient and keep mum. And our new guests, and all earlier, there awaits a sad end. Those two seem to be a perfect felt in the darkness of the church. A city - no. There is a local legend. By hearsay, it is called the "hunter". He is strong? Perhaps. On the Green Road raised the smoke. So, the information until they have reached? As always. Strange that they do not wondered the source of smoke. As always. They trust me, Lesher. This is stupid. Indeed, as why would they not believe? Wagons, which I gave to them, enough to feed an army. However, as they did. Have you seen a Legate? This is not your business. As this is not my Lesher? The representative of the tower -- important person. If you want something to do send the latest installment goods in my possession in Aysine. Prepare to travel as soon as possible. And do not shumy much. I do not necessarily have to take responsibility for it themselves. Be sure, if you have interest in its share. Now go. I made it for the sake of the family. All - just for them. If you are on the missing money or that only you knew the exact time of arrival of caravans, I'm afraid you have already calculated. I'll pay for everything. But I have a suggestion. In exchange for the safety of my family. Families traitors are sent to the hill. This is a death sentence. When the power does not remain, they die. There are a few things. The secret! You get it, if smilueshsya of my family. Why does your secret so expensive? Because you are in danger. And what if the meeting with the Legate of this bad? He asked me to gather the townspeople Dolanu and help to build the temple. If you need to let work to death. Dead unlikely will be able to pay taxes. This Legate, Meg Kiln differs from those who came before. He asks questions on the other. On the past. The architect said it no ordinary priest. Never mind. How long it here not last. Like the rest. Like all the previous ones it will destroy the city. Qualitatively. The work of elves. I know how to look elven arrows. What else? Here is a great place to order to arrange the ambush. These thieves know where to go. Monster was here, I feel. Soon he will be roasted monster. While there will be this Legate, We must get rid from nizkopoklonnichestva and give promise of the tower ever to keep her faithful. Nizkopoklonnichestvo - you know. Not smey, Krolis. I am concerned only one. A small link in the chain our devotion to the tower. Elven knife? Sure. Everyone knows that Hunter brought elves. And he - trickster, capable of the most heinous acts. The best is - it is block the way to the city. Check whether all know of the hunter. I think I am in the tavern properly explained to them all. Where are you going? Tavern at the wrong side. Excellent, Gaelen. I do not remember how many times I had to raise the shield. How many more times you have to fall? What's the matter, Gaelen? As a girl? Innocent. What are you talking about. You gave the tithe? Yes. And? Dad, in an area of Blekuire I saw Iana. Her hanged? No, it was in the crowd. I knew that the cause of the girl. So, my baby Iana returned. She always liked me. Thorns and roses, a deadly mixture. It is on the side of the hunter. I am glad to hear that. Morrec -- a great guy. It does not matter. Morrec needs good people. You're a good man, son. In your blood flowing Erenlend. - Are you strong. - So what? I go? Leave a blind father and engage in the farm? You will die of hunger earlier than the cows. Shadow took away my eyes, Gaelen, but not the heart. Do not take it. That is what he wants. That he needs. How do you know? I know that you do not want to stay here and rot with us. What do you believe in something, that a new day will come. Say it! A new day will come! Here you see that coming. What is it? I do not know. Once here there were magic. Yes. It seems that everything is repeated. What is written here? This is the only entry? Go ahead. Several years ago I was down here to see the temple grounds. Then I found this. Are you ever wondered why the church never to build, even after a hundred years? Corrupt fools you type never reluctant to consecrate him. Legate ruled everywhere. But not in Blackweir... Really, why? I no this is not told. Do not dare. Legates! Dolan. Dolan, what is it? You brought us here, and why would not you say? I said. Chuzara in danger. Your stone is said to you? Legate, gentlemen! Your stone was right, Meg. Chuzaru eaten by pirates. Who are you? I am the city magistrate, your lordship. Did you know that Blackweir waiting for the return of the shadows? Mercy. I'm trying to do everything possible for your Highness. I do not have time for you, Magistrate. Your grace. Your grace. I have information ... I know about the crimes against the tower. Find Chuzaru. Be careful. I find it. Convinced me that I did not spend time in vain. Blekuir was captured by the Mayor Lesher nearly ten years. It has long been concealing income from taxes. Do you think that Legate does not know? This is not all! It specifically delayed construction of the temple, to buy time for theft. It is tricky! Do not how you talk, the magistrate. The delay was caused by an attack on caravans to deliver the goods. It makes an architect tell her all about caravans. Reports all hunters. Lesher familiar with the hunter? It has a squeaker. I do not believe that Hunter knows the source. What Lesher uses it. Lesher not as clever as you think. I do not understand. It is clear that the tower is interested in is to find this man. Let me help find it! I am afraid that this is not my power, the magistrate. When you do away with Lesher, Blekuayru will need a mayor. Dedicated tower. Well, ready? Who asked? Teros Sword Obsidiya. Spiritual Legate of the title. Shadow of the north, and so on. Well, if this is not the servant of a Legate. It's amazing what you can not tavern, and not with a bottle in his hand. Yes, the shower and asked to go there. But you know, the guy at the desk so stinks, I was not able to make more of this. It is terribly razit onion. I'm sorry. As to the travel in the temple? By the Legate? I think too late to play. Stop, stop, stop, look, you can not wait to sleep? But first you want to see the Legate. Now. This mayor knows Lesher. Most likely. Who's there? Krolis? Quiet! Wonderful! Only the best psychologist may recognize my dodge duplicity. Shut your it. Now. Amazing! Lost child Elsedera, and such a terrible person. You stop. Wait. Here I thought that too late to play. I hope your friend does not around anywhere nearby. No? No? Okay. What do you want? So, we'll see. To never again feel smell this god forgotten village. And that people have stopped believe in its ghost. I want something warm. What you need to Legate? Who am I to know that he needs? Well, you go with us or not? Lesher hang your intestine to the wall. It is clear that it all want to show impressive amount of my dignity. Answer the question! I go with you. Excellent. The air is heavy today. Something happens. I cleanse myself. I repudiate you. What you need here? Leave me. You do not need words. I must do it alone. I have been told that your race disappeared from this earth for a long time. We do not die so easily. You killed them. All. They have been hunted to their for that place. You join them, Legate. Too late. If you want, kill me, but then you kill a free man, not the Legate. The old man insisted on that will take you. Live. Stop! They caught me. Yes, he does not forgive. They know me on this. The spot, which can not wash off. Perhaps, and it was not. I can not lift the shadow of your soul. No. It is, I will devote the remainder of his life. Where are you looking at? We call it sleep. Looks are not very. Sometimes. You like? What brought you here from the Blekuayra? Beer is over? Buyers ended, a hunter. What happened? Legate! He arrested Lesher and began to hang the townspeople. What? You should know about it. Where would not have gone Legates, there is always - a pile of nothing. He needs me. Keep track of everyone who enters or leaves the city. Ok. Every hour hang three, while I will not bring a hunter. Do you think I am cruel? On the contrary, I am merciful. Many cities have been destroyed entirely for smaller crimes. I assure you that Blackweir will not be equal to preserve the fidelity to the tower, Your Grace. You made the right choice. Elven knife. Dodge archness. Dodge, your lordship? Indeed robbers brought elves. I'm tired of your lies, Lesher. The city - as a mature the fruit that you want to disrupt. And you do not need no church and no Legates. Bloodthirsty scoundrel streets Eysina could be anyone, even the mayor. Mercy, your grace. I can be useful. Maybe. Such cities as this, attract all the worst. Idealists and fraudsters. The city stores terrible secret, right? And such a cunning rat, as You could not not know. Y. .. I do not know. Then you do not need me. No. Stop. Tell me about the dead Legate. Tell that knew Dolan. These are just legends. Which tell the children. Welcome to the darkness. Thanks to your mercy, I go under his shadow. You are very fast, my dear friend. Observers have reported to us about your arriving only two weeks ago. But nothing is said about the purpose of visit. Rain, church Sanulela soon disappear. Speak gently! Allies first Legate everywhere. You've heard about the prophecy? Fear North presages the emergence of a strong enemy. And predicts the return of to whom we are waiting for a long time. This is possible? Indeed, after the ritual, not to mention our only one error, all dead. What if we were not mistaken? She is still alive? Her strength amazes even me. I had to guess, that you have come for it! While I am happy to fucking again see you, dear friend. Suppose that is here, while do not remember anything. Or not yet sdohnet. Hunter will come? Of course. What if the fraudster stole Tosha? The fraudster - a Legate? Hardly. What do you think Chuzara? Kruce said you found something in the woods. Something that made the you return. I am worried for you. Monitor Architect was not a good idea. How do you take? Do you remember the ghosts in the house? Think of prevention? In the woods I found a ruined building. It looks like its built Legates during the first war. Leaving us with a warning. Warning from the antiquity. I could see only one word. Yes? The word "prisoner". Elves ever sleep? Not so, as human beings. We are - children of the sun and stars. Where Morrec? And both are very small. Deleth! He passed away the night. I thought you a friend of his. Friend. He destroys himself to stop the execution. He did not say. Iana is not stupid. You do not know the intentions Morrec. And you that, you know? What are you doing? I feel that we are going in this direction. For hundreds of years, they came to this place. To die. For this door strength. What in this situation may help to power? Those that have tried to do envoys from many years ago. The force, which helped them. I wonder what other secrecy hides the city. The first keeper rests. It can not be busy. I came to it from the tower. I know. But it run even the first Legate. How long do you serve? Five years, I - her eyes. Then for the first time in five years, I ask you do something for me. Wake her. Shay. I am glad to see you in full health. Which shade of darkness disturb you at this time, Geddon? What does not give you rest? Perhaps the moonlight reminds you about the brother? As a white spot in the night. What do you know about my brother? Not just about the brother, but a twin brother. Memories of him have you. He died. A long time. From my hands. You saw a lot, Geddon, what has been hidden from the eyes. The hearts of people. Heart say, and you hear them. I came to you for advice. And not to discuss his brother. Once the tower finally reaches Blekuira, Grimnor. This is inevitable. There is nothing imminent. Do you like anyone you know that. It seems to me unlikely that young Legate change and unlikely to wake his conscience. Morrec, after so many years, you have to suspect, Blekuire that there is something, that are not able to protect the tower. Son brought me to this place. Legates locked his here in this stone. Two thousand years he spent here. Once the shadow fell, he helped me bury him and it must remain so, and concealment. His time has come again. And not just him. Blackweir has strong roots. Land remembers his valiant past. There is one place, oath place where the shadow loses its force. We need your help. I am going to Blackweir, Deleth. I know. And as the journey from elf help me? Monsters are dual salaries for each new hearing, pribitoe to the gate of the city. There seems to fool found a company. For me it would do the same. Yes, but he will find another way. The fact that he would be killed, he did not help. And do not avenge your family. He said so? Yes. Although there should have been. It is clear that among you is a big gap. Wen Haag found the manuscript in an abandoned store in the mountains in the north. Once it served as a girl. In winter, the walls formed thick layer of ice. She thrust a hand into ice as far as possible. And admire the reflection of her. She was very beautiful. Do you? Before it became a inspector. Prior to his death. He could sit for hours, not feeling the wind, looking south. The dream of the Legates, which never comes. Will. It is written, that it appears. And that there would be this sign. Beirial. You should be left weapons before entering. Elves do not give up the weapons. Make an exception. It looks suspicious. You underestimate the elves. No! Not there. What was that? They told me that there too dangerous. Too. A strange journey. It is impossible to meet by darkness on an empty stomach. Leave me Kruce. What is this place? We'll come again. Beirial. Deleth, no! Elves have never been slow. Why the slowness? I came back for you. I am here to save Rights Gaelen, this is not a game. I go with you? Ian, we must be going. You what? What is that? Elf! Elf! Elf! Elf! They are. Give me a weapon. Elves have never leave their weapons. Do what he said Deleth. He taught the same, and who I am. Gaelen. Go. What's the matter, Chuzara? Zharko. Too hot for me. You know, I would have preferred to see their women alive. Rather see the dead. Problems? Guess. Who is it? They will kill him. There is another way. Better. Chuzara. Tosh. When the words disappeared, I thought you killed the elves. But here everything is worse. I Megom Kilnom. Butcher Geddona. Why, Tosh? To be on the side of the world. Announce that the shadow take your life. All. Previously, you never was so fascinated by faith. Or you forgot that in our it was banned? How you can confuse love two novices to this heresy? Avoid it, Chuzara. Without it, difficult, but but this is real life. Choose between you and my God? If you think that I support this temptation, you fool. This Izrador you believes duroy, Chuzara. You and everyone else. Or do you think shadow of the truth and cares about you? To me you are dead, the hunter. Even if so, when I I saw you there in the yard, for a moment, I wished to he chose someone else. I do not want to make you hurt. It is a threat? Meg. I know. It is here. It is still alive. Stay with it. Be careful. Do you? Northern Star in the shade. Southern stars must shine for them. Grimnasales. Enter Lord Domosuuran. And you too, Iana. Dark Night today. I know you? Just dark. Legate comes in den monster, and it will last. I knew that thou shalt come, Legate. Tosh Kamar! Izrador waiting for you. Tosh Kamar dead. You can not win. Afraid of the farmer? Enough to play in the charade. Grimnor was right. You go for me until death. The pride of a Legate, I am familiar with it. Envoys concluded you in jail. How you managed to escape? I'm relieved your enemy. Dorosul! We were born from one breathing, your teacher and myself. He had the power on me in this place. And in the shadows of darkness, it will be dance with the monster. And the monster learns it, who it is and who he becomes. Legates locked him in the stone. Antiquity covered him runami warnings. ?? ??????? ??? ? ??????, ????? allow it to take shape. What is the power to Legate such as this? You've heard about the new prophet? I was able to deal with only one word. He will stand for hours. That word - "prisoner." Do not feel the wind, looking south, dreaming of the Legates, which never comes. Who? Beirial. Defer not, Meriam. Lord Domosuuran. Iana. This place will belong to the north. Grimnasales. Strazhnik is no more, Deleth. Those who are twice must come together as a flock of hungry locusts Faroduna. That would mean his return. If you're right, weird is about to be realized. Where to now, Legate? Find someone who either never betrayed me. Only the king of darkness is power to destroy a senior. No, not the king of darkness will be able to do so. Grimnasales who killed the guards? This Legate. Meg Kiln. It can not destroy all of those who put him in prison, that talk about one Legates? This is not an ordinary Legate. It is a harbringer. The time has come. Do you speak in riddles? You must know, sir, that we are here then to release the hunter. Perhaps he was already dead. Yes, John. If you will be easier, I can you are sure that Morrec alive. While. Who are you? You do not remember, huh? And I remember. Girl. Dirty. Frozen. Runs into the woods. Escaping from trouble. In the forest was a man. He brought you to where the food was. Cranberry likely. It was close, yet you are not warm. It was you. You sang to me, under a big tree. Yes, under a tree. Then you fell asleep. When awake, you have not been. But you found someone, right? Someone very important. Boy. Gaelen. I left Gaelen with orcs. I doubt that his fate in the hands of orcs. Gaelen went on a journey which should not be missed. Grimnasales. Do you want to say that the friend Iana ... For everything there is a time Domosuuran. I heard about the books. I thought it was all destroyed by the Shadow many years ago. Most yes, but good People kept that could brought here and hidden them from our enemies from the north. Probably, they are very valuable. For a couple-three of these books can be purchased Blekuir and all of his tenure, Iana. This treasure! More than just treasure. Here is the soul people. The knowledge generations. Awaiting days to come again.
