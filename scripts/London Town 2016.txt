Come on, boys. - Tossers. - Shay, what does shagging mean? - Cooking, that's all. - Oh. Mum's a much better shagger than you. - Well, she didn't make your favorite pudding every night like I do, did she? [instrumental music] - What's that? - Nothing. Mind your own business. [engine revving] - Hey, hey. Hey, hey. I'm home. - Daddy! - Oh, hello, munchkin. How are you? Oh, oh! Is that tea ready? Whoa. Bloody long day. I'll tell you that. However, I sold an upright Steinway. - Huh. That's great. - It'll help. What's the score? - Oh, the Os. I forgot it was on. - How'd you forget? - I've been a bit busy with school shopping, picking up Alice, cooking you dinner. - Like a proper little wife. I'm only kidding. It's appreciated. Oh, by the way, I have got us a lead on some tickets for the FA Cup match between Chelsea and Leyton Orient. - How'd you do that? - Oh, one of my clients in the shop. Not bad, eh? That ought to make up for the eight hours I've got to spend in the taxi tonight. - I got a package from mum. What if I went to stay the summer with her in London? - She asked that? - Well, I want to go to London. - I'm sure you do, sweetheart, but ain't no one going to London for the summer. - Why not? - We've already been over this, Shay. I need you here in the shop with me. - Well, what if I need to be there? You can't keep me from my mum. I'm not your bloody slave. - That's enough. - Oh, bollocks to you! - Hey, come here. No child of mine is gonna live in a bloody squat with a bunch of hippies let alone, look at me let alone with a woman more interested in being her 14-year-old's mate than his mother. - She's not even like that. I'm nearly 15. - She keeps promising to come for you. Let's see if that ever happens, eh? - You're just mad she's in London being somebody while you're feeding off the bottom in Wanstead. - Come here. Come here! [door slams] - Daddy, what's a squat? - It's no place for a young lady like yourself. That's for damn sure. But it was Four Tops all night With encores from.. [muffled song] Shay! Shay! Roots rock rebel Onstage they ain't got.. Have you lost your mind, boy? Turn that off. Turn that off! What is that? - I don't know. Mum sent it. - Listen, I know you're angry with me but we do have neighbors. Do you understand? Good. I'm going on my shift now. You look after Alice, okay? The British army is waiting out there And it weighs fifteen hundred tons White youth Black youth Better find another solution Why not phone up Robin Hood And ask him for some wealth distribution? - Oh, I've got to get to London. - And leave Wanstead? Are you mad? At least you can play that classical duff. - I don't want to play classical. My dad makes me. I hate it. I've got to work in his lame shop all summer, as well. - Plenty of pianos there to practice. - Piss off. Jack, why you got to bother me all the time? [laughs] My six-year-old sister's got more brains than him. - He's just pissed off he's not gonna have anyone to beat up, now he's leaving. - If we stay here, we'll be deadbeats just like them wankers. - On the dole? - Yeah. It's what I get for being the product of a broken home. Statistics don't lie. I'm doomed. [laughs] Hi, dad. - On the counter. Congratulations on finishing the year. - Are you serious? - Oh, I am, indeed. You've done a great job this year in school. I'm proud of you. Um, that's not all. I need you to go round into London for me and pick up some spare parts from Al. I thought you might want to treat yourself to something while you're there. - No, it's alright. You don't have to. - Get out of here. I'll see you tonight. Skedaddle. - The next station is West Brompton. Change here for London Underground District Line and National Rail services. Alight here for Earls Court Exhibition Centre. Please mind the gap between the train and the platform. - What are you looking at? [muffled song on headphones] Well? - I was just wondering what you're listening to. - Piss off. - Come on, I'm curious. - Curious? - Come on. [song continues] [chuckles] Thanks. Who are they? - What, you've been living under a rock? - Worse, I think. Wanstead. [laughs] - You're funny. - What's your name? - Vivian. - Suits you. - Yeah, well, what's yours? - Shay. - Guevara. I like that. The Clash. - Huh? - The band, it's The Clash. - I've never heard of them. - I can tell. What are you up to? - I'm picking up some parts for my dad and see me mum. - I'm gonna go get tickets for tomorrow's show. The Clash are playing with the Buzzcocks. Now, it's sold out, but they're doing a last-minute release. You should go too if you know what's good for you. - Yeah? - Yeah. You gonna drink that? [laughs] [instrumental music] Civilization. Thank God. - This is nothing. - That's them. Beautiful-looking blokes, ain't they? - No, they're sexy. - No wonder I can't get a girlfriend. I thought it was me spots. [laughs] - I've shagged them all. Two at a time. [laughs] You're too easy. - You know.. I should really go if I'm gonna get to me mum's and the music supply. - What, you'd rather see your mum and go shopping than go to Camden Town? What kind of a man are you? - Wait. Wait, wait up. - A decent working-class British man can't find a job because of the immigrants. That's the facts! And the British working man is tired and fed up with having everything laid out on a plate for the Pakis and the Coons! It's time to take care of our own. It's time to stop immigration and start repatriation. Stop immigration! Start repatriation! - Daft clowns. Like they can get a job anyway. - I thought you punks supported them. - Not me punks. Not The Clash. They're totally against it. I mean, all you got to do is listen to one of Strummer's lyrics. Like, um, "White youth, black youth "better find another solution. "Why don't you phone up Robin Hood and ask him for some wealth distribution?" - So he's a rotten commie. - It's about us getting along. We're all in the same boat. It's the rich who are killing us. - The rich? Well, why didn't anyone tell me? [laughs] - Hey, Ronnie. - Alright, Viv. You're in luck, my friends. Two tickets left. - Oh, nice one. - Of course. Are you sure you want to waste this on him? - Now, now, Ronnie. - Suit yourself. Right, all out. I'm afraid that's it, guys. Piss off. - The little prat can barely see over the table and he's got the last bleeding ticket? - Yeah, and if you got a problem with it you can take it up with me. - Hey. - No, no, no. That's punk. Start with this. You know, you'd look good with black hair like Strummer. He's a handsome-looking devil, ain't he? - Me with black hair? If you say so. - I do. Anyway, I've got to go. My dad's gonna kill me. - So that's it? - What, you thought I was gonna suck you off too? - No, I... - I might. [laughs] I'll meet you out front before the show. I said something better change I said something better change I said something better change Change change something better change Change change - You won't get better than that. - I want that one in there as well. - That one? That one should be 650 but if you buy this one I'll give it to you for 625. - Okay. - How about that, hmm? It's a bargain. - What about this one here? - This right here? Now, this one should be 850 but if you buy both of them, 800 quid. Shay! I thought you'd be here hours ago. Be right with you. - What about the drums at the back? - The drums at the back, I'll let you have that one for 700 quid, okay? - 700? - Come on, it should be 750. Have a look at the ones on the left. I'll let you have the whole lot two guitars and the drum kit. - Nine hundred. - Two grand, two grand. Two, two grand. - Two grand? - Yeah, alright? It'll be far more expensive for me. [piano music] Go have a look at the drums. Go on, the ones on the left. [chuckles] These punks they're worse than the hippies. Just get uglier and uglier. - Better than disco. - Truer words never spoken. Come on. I've got the parts for you. If they got anything to say There's many black ears here to listen But it was Four Tops all night With encores from stage right Charging from the bass knives to the treble But onstage they ain't [music stops] If they got anything to say There's many black ears here to listen But it was Four Tops all night With encores from stage right But onstage they ain't got no roots Rock rebel Dress back jump back.. - Shay, dinner! 'Cause it won't get you anywhere [music stops] Shay! - Why are you wearing mum's hat? Daddy, Shay's wearing mum's hat. - You trying to do me over, boy? You trying to do me over? [door opens] I never want to see that thing again. You hear me? And what have you done to your hair? - It's your fault she left. [door shuts] [door shuts] - I got to take Alice to the child minders before we move the piano. So set the straps while I'm gone. - I'm leaving early tonight to go to a concert. - Huh? What concert? Who, who's gonna look after Alice? I've got to be in the taxi all night. And where, where, by the way did you get the money for a concert, huh? - From you. I'm going. [laughs] - I know you think you've got it all so figured out but it's not as simple as you think. - Well, it's not exactly rocket science, is it, either? - I hope you don't get that anger for me, boy 'cause it's only worth it if it's worth it. Come on, sweetie. - I guess your music really wasn't worth it. Was it, dad? [instrumental music] Hey now it's a matter of opinion If you agree Someone else will say the opposite Well hey now you won't ever change the weather Take what's there if it's rain or if it's shine Are you running too fast? Are you walking.. - Come on boys, pull, pull. [grunts] - Oi, I like your hair. A little Sid Vicious, are ya? - Uh, Sid's a wanker. [grunts] - Who do you like then? - The Clash. - Come on, Shay.

Where's your mother? - She's, she's on her way. Is he gonna die? - No, no. He has sustained some rather serious injuries but he'll be fine. I'm afraid we will have to keep him in for a few weeks, though. - I want daddy. - Can we see him? - Daddy! - Oh, hello. Do you want to sit beside him over here? - Why is he just lying there? Is he sleeping? - Well, yes. Um, the, the doctor did, uh, an operation so the, uh, doctor put him to sleep and, and he fixed his leg and he put that cast on it. And, and now he's just sleeping to get better. - When's mummy coming home? - Soon. - Well, what are we gonna do? - Well, I don't know. I'll think of something. Here, eat your dinner. - I don't like that, Shay. - Well, you'll have to have it. - Well, I don't want it. - Alice, please. - I don't want it. - Alright, listen to me. I'm gonna be like dad for the next couple of weeks so you're gonna have to do what I say. - But you're not an adult. - Well, I better be. Otherwise we're gonna be in deep trouble. Did you hear me? [instrumental music] Alice, I'm serious. Go on, get ready for bed. I'll keep it for later. - It's rubbish. - It is. Don't be cheeky.

But he gave up the band. - Well, what makes you think that? - Well, he bloody quit playing, didn't he? Opened the shop. - Oh, no, no, no. Shay, Shay, I, I left your dad. I mean, he did everything he could. I, I.. I, I don't know what gave you that idea. - He did. - Yeah, well, he was probably trying to protect me to protect you. [sighs] - So why did you never come and visit us.. You know, after all those letters you sent saying that you would? - Yeah, yeah, well, I, I meant it, you know? When I, when I wrote that, I meant that. I just.. [sighs] I mean, life gets complicated sometimes, you know? I'll make it up to you. I promise. [woman moaning] [moaning] [instrumental music] [engine starts] [music continues] [music continues] - I need to find Vivian. Do you know where she lives? - It's not for me to say, mate. - Just tell me where I can find her. It's really important. - Sorry, kid. - Do you fancy football? [chuckles] [knocking on door] - May I help you, sir? - Does Vivian live here? - And who might you be? - I be Shay. Who are you, her butler? So she lives here then? Vivian! - Ms. Daniels isn't accepting any callers. Good day. - I'm not a caller. I'm her boyfriend, you old git. - Stop right there! - Vivian! Vivian! - Now, go, out with you, now. - Stop! Shay! Stop! Shay! - Do you know this guttersnipe, Ms. Daniels? - Well, he isn't. Let him go! - Get off me! Daniels, yeah? And this is where you live? Who are you? Are you the daughter of Thatcher's little pig? Liar. - What are you doing here? I told... - My dad's in hospital. And we're losing everything. Is that good enough? - Shay. - Piss off! [sniffling] [sniffles] - The time is now. - Says who? - Says everybody. - You cannot mount a poxy revolution on hearsay. - Depends on who's doing the saying. - The question here is, what's more important. The truth or freedom from it? - Why don't we ask Shay here as he is too young to be corrupted. Shay, what's more important the truth or freedom from it? - I don't know. Isn't it the same thing? Exactly. - Good morning, all. You alright? - I am very well. - Oh, good. Mm. - How's Alice? - Yeah, yeah, she's better. She went back to sleep. You alright? Let me get you something proper. What is that? - Oh, make me something proper, too, will you? - Oh, me, too, please. - Yeah. - Oi! Oi, guys, they're doing it. It's happening here, Victoria Park. Gonna be a march, Anti-Nazi League a free concert, The Damned! - Aw, piss off. - And The Clash! - The Clash? - Convenient, we get the piss kicked out of us by a bunch of skinheads, then a free concert. Lovely. - Let's go! - Shay, do you want to come? - Mum? - Yeah, alright. It'll be good for ya. You better eat that on the way. It's alright. Can we hear it, please, for The Clash? White riot I wanna riot White riot a riot of my own White riot I wanna riot White riot a riot of my own - Anti-Nazi League. This is the official collection for the Anti-Nazi League. We're gonna put the money into property.. [indistinct announcement] [indistinct chattering] - You ready? - Yeah. [indistinct chanting] - Come here. - I was hoping not to see these National Front skins. [glass shattering] - Come on now! - Jesus. - This is gonna go ballistic, alright? Stay close. - Alright. [indistinct yelling] [siren blaring] - We just need to get past this to the concert. [indistinct yelling] - Oh, oh, oh! - Get off me! - Stop it! Get your hands off her, you bald prick. - Shay, no!

Ain't that right? - Oh, yeah. Thanks, Paul, mate. Regards to your family, yeah? Hey, Paul? It's not your fault, mate you got shit for brains! I can't help all of ya! [laughs] It's alright, mate. You're not my type. [groans] - That's not what you said the last time you saw me. - What? My bird! Is it you? They finally got you with that taxi, huh? - No, I was beating up a skinhead. - Oh, were ya? [laughs] You weren't at my concert, were ya? - I thought it was you. [sighs] What's your name, shorty? - Shay. - Guevara? Is that you? - Heard that one before. [laughs] - Come on. [groans] Hell of a concert, though, yeah? I think we might've woken up a couple of corpses. And isn't this the cherry on top? Home sweet home. - What did they get you for, anyway? - Disturbing the peace, I suppose. [laughing] Strange, isn't it? - The silence? - Yeah. - I miss it when it's not there sometimes. You know, just a feeling in your stomach like this is all that matters. - How do you mean? - I don't know but maybe it's just one shot at it. And that's the last. [laughs] - You've been listening to too much of my preaching, shorty. Getting a bit deep, isn't ya? I'm gonna have to turn you on to something a little softer, son like maybe a little Bee Gees. - Well, not in this life, mate. [laughing] Me dad says.. It's only worth it if it's worth it. - Yeah, well, you listen to your dad, alright? He sounds like a wise man. - Yeah. He gave everything up for us. - Yeah? - Not my mum, though. Went on her own trip, left us. London was calling, I guess. - Oh, mate, look.. Some people just burn bright, you know? But they're plugged in somewhere else completely. And maybe we've got no right to expect them to be burning bright just for us, just for our sake. Do you know what I mean? - Bollocks. - Yeah, bollocks. Bollocks! Do you hear that, boys? Shay Guevara says it's your bollocks! - Oi, shut it! [laughing] - You alright, Shay? Yeah? - Yeah. [chuckles] - Try and get some sleep, yeah? [groans] - On your marks, gentlemen.

[laughs] This is my Alice. - Look at you. - Now, Thatcher, that's someone who gets me out of bed in the morning. - Come off it, man, the Strummer says this the Strummer says that. - But Strummer also says, right that you and I should be friends. Black and white in it together. - It took the bloody Clash telling you that for you to figure that out, huh? Some mate you are. - I know Strummer. - Sure you do, mate. We all do. - No, I really do. - The revolution can wait. Come on, the food is getting cold. Johnny. - Hey, no judgments, Shay. [indistinct chattering] - What are you doin'?

Give her to me. - No. Johnny, you take her.

Not that you'd understand. - I don't need some 13-year-old punk judging me. - I'm 15! You don't even know me age! I've got to take care of everything you run away from. - I didn't ask you to, and I don't tell you how to live your life or what to do, do I? - Me and Alice need a mum, not a drunk mate! You don't deserve Johnny. And you sure as hell didn't deserve dad! - You fuck off! [engine starting] - Mummy. Mummy, wake up. We're going to see daddy. Mummy? Mummy. Come on. - Come now, best be goin'. - We can see mum soon, right? - Yeah, of course we can. Oi, mate, what are you doing with my taxi? - It belongs to London Taxi Company. - Hey, whoa, whoa, wait. - I'm bringing it back to 'em. - Oh, come on, mate. - Take it up with the company. - I'll pay you, man, come on. No! No, mate, come on! Come on now! - We're fucked. What? How are we gonna make any money? - We'll be fine. - Oh, we're gonna have to live with gran. - No, we won't. - She smells, Shay! - I'll handle it. I've got an idea. - What idea? - Joe Strummer, I know him. If I could just get him to come to the opening I can make it work. Come on, Alice. Come on, Alice! [sighs] [instrumental music] - Good luck, son. You're gonna need it. I'll try and put the word out to the town for you. - Cheers, Al. - Okay, boys, let's go. [telephone ringing] - Hello? The Rock Shop. Oh, hi, Vivian. No, Shay's not here. Well, he told me to say that. Shay was in the nick with Joe Strummer and we're putting on a concert in our own shop. - Alice, you weren't supposed to say that. - Well, we need as much publicity as we can get. - You alright? - Yeah. I'm feeling much better, actually. - I think the nurse fancies you. - Uh, you think? I haven't exactly had lot of time on my hands for that kind of thing, have I? - Because you're still in love with mum? - No, Shay. Do you want me to be? - I mean, you was always kind of a nag with her. - Guess it must've seemed that way, yeah. - It did. - Listen.. I know you're mad and that you blame me for your mother and everything. - Dad... - No, listen. I want you to listen to me, Shay. I mean, you and your sister, you're the best thing that I ever did. I mean, you helped me, both of you when I was feeling low and I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. So don't go feeling sorry for me or blaming yourself. [laughs] I love my life. And I only hope that you love yours half as much as I do. So when you're done being angry I want you to remember that.. Okay? Good. Now get your ass out of here and go and look after your sister. - You've got to be kidding me! You're the tosser that's going off about The Clash coming to Wanstead? - Actually, they are comin'. Shay knows him. They went to rehearsal and everything. - The only way he'd know rock stars is if they took turns shaggin' his mum. [laughing] - I've taken on skinheads twice your size. [Alice screaming] - Shay! [grunting] - Are you gonna stop talking about my family? - Ow, my nose! - On Sunday morning, so he could learn all about the goods. - Oh, how ridiculous. What is there to learn about toys? All you do is bounce them, cuddle them or turn them on. - Just like girls, really. - No, the government isn't helping people and the working class is all but forgotten. Just look around you, you can see it. And now we've got these National Front tossers and they're just taking advantage of people. But that's wrong, man. No, people have got to take it into their own hands. - So you're calling for a revolution of sorts. [Strummer laughs] - You're gonna get me into trouble, man. But, but, but yeah, yeah, like, a musical one, for real. You know, we've got, we've got an obligation The Clash has, you know, to tell people to wake up. Wake the bloody hell up, people. This is a pirate life. [instrumental music] Oh oh oh oh pa Ra pa Pa Ra Ra pa Ra.. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, no, mate, can we see Joe? - Do what, kid? - I need to see Joe. - Well, they've gone. Look, I've locked up already. - I'm telling you, he knows me. Can you just give him this? - Do you know how many of these we get every day? Go give this to Joe. Give that to Joe. I can't keep giving him all of these. - Oh, come on, mate. - No, no, you'll be alright. Just come back tomorrow. - Thanks. Oi, does Joe Strummer live here? I'm a mate of his. - Piss off. - I need to talk to him. It's important. Please. He knows me, I swear. - Please stop. He really does know him. - He comes in and out. I don't know when he'll be back. - Can you just give him this, please? - I don't know if I'll see him. [train horn blaring] - Shay? - Yeah? - What if Joe doesn't show up to the shop? - He'll show up. - Well, he better. [dramatic music] [clanking] - What are you doing? - What? - Stay here. [music continues] Oi, who's there? - Shay? - Penelope? - Where have you been? We've been worried sick. - We? - Daddy! - Hi, sweetheart, how are you? Oh, it's good to see you. Can you take Alice out? I just need to speak to Shay for a minute, sweetheart. On you go. - Come on, honey. - Thanks. What's The Rock Shop, and where's my taxi? - They took the taxi. I had to do something. - A bit more than something. Well? - Drastic times calls for drastic measures. - Don't use my words against me, boy. Now, what is goin' on? - I sold the stock and updated it. That's all. We, we needed to go another direction. Dad, you don't need to worry. I've got a plan. I know Joe personally and he'll help. - Are you on drugs, son? - Just try saying thanks. - I wanted to get first in the queue for tomorrow. - I'm not a guttersnipe. - Well, I wouldn't care. I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth. You forgive me? [instrumental music] - Come on. You'll catch your death out here. - Open up! - Open up, come on. - Are they actually gonna play? - We want The Clash! - Shay? - Open the door! - I think we should call the police. This could get ugly. - Oh, bollocks. - What? - Open up! - It's me dad. - We want The Clash. - Come here. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] You kept my album, I see. - Yeah. - That's about the only thing. - I'm Shay's dad. - I'm Vivian. How do you do? - Fantastic. You did good. It should've been done a long time ago, truth be told. Thanks. [pounding on the door] What do you want to do? - This is my doin'. I'll handle it. - Hmm. - Step back, everyone. Come on. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] Welcome to the grand opening of The Rock Shop. Thanks for your patience, everyone. I'm sure The Clash will be here very soon. Uh, but first I want to give you a warm-up, me. [keyboard music] [indistinct] - Alright, alright, that's enough! That's enough. No show today, folks. On you go. Come on, Shay, let's go. - No way, The Clash is showing up, mate. - I said go on. [indistinct chatter] - Shay, look! - Oi, shorty! Is this all for me? [cheering] Alright, man. You alright? I was supposed to be somewhere else tonight but I couldn't let my mate down, yeah? This is for my mate, Shay and his dear old dad, and The Rock Shop.
