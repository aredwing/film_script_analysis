GOODS AND PEOPLE ARE LANDED HERE, WHICH IS NEW YORK CITY. THEN THEY'RE PUT ON CANAL BOATS AND TOWED UP THE HUDSON RIVER- HERE. THEY START UP ALONG THE ERIE CANAL- HERE- AND TOMORROW WHEN THE SEASON OPENS, YOU'LL SEE BOATS GOING WEST, TAKING OUT GOODS AND SETTLERS- WAY OUT THROUGH THE INDIANS COUNTRY, MAYBE ALL THE WAY TO THE PACIFIC COAST, MEN WHO'LL START FARMS AND BUILD NEW CITIES. THEN IN TIME, OTHER BOATS WILL COME BACK LOADED WITH WHEAT AND GRAIN AND THINGS THEY'LL BUILD IN THOSE TOWNS RIGHT ALONG HERE, DOWN TO NEW YORK. THEN THEY'LL BE PUT ON BIGGER BOATS AND SENT OVER TO EUROPE AGAIN. SORT OF AN ENDLESS CHAIN IT IS, JUST A-COMIN' AND A-GOIN', A- COMIN' AND A-GOIN'.

HE SAID YOU HAD DRUNK MORE THAN ANYBODY EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CANAL. THAT WAS ONLY UP TO 3:00. BY 4:30, THEY WAS ALL WILLING TO INCLUDE THE GREAT LAKES. WHO'S THAT FELLA? I JUST INTRODUCED YOU TO HIM. - WHAT'S HIS NAME? - MR. HARROW. I DON' LIKE HIM. NOW, YOU DON'T KNOW MR. HARROW. YOU GOT TO BE POLITE. IS HE A CANALLER? HE WORKS ON SAMSON WEAVER'S BOAT. GO ON NOW 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO GET SOME SLEEP. OH, SO THAT'S WHY YOU MADE ME TIE UP HERE LAST NIGHT. YOU SAID THAT'S SAMSON WEAVER'S BOAT. DON'T PAY NO NOTICE TO HIM. - DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT? - NO. GO ON NOW, JOTHAM, AND GO AND GET YOUR LAST DRINK. I HATE A LIAR. THE RECORD'S SORT OF GONE TO HIS HEAD. WHY'D YOU KEEP HER FROM COOKING MY BREAKFAST? I AIN' STOPPED HER. GET ON THAT BOAT. DON'T YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT. MAYBE THE TIME HAS COME FOR ME TO GIVE YOU A GOOD LICKIN'. THAT TIME AIN'T NEVER GONNA COME, KLORE, AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HUMORING YOU. NOW, YOU GET ON THAT BOA AND GET YOUR BREAKFAST! DANGED IF I LIKED THAT. DID YOU KNOW IT WAS OUR BOAT LAST NIGHT? THAT AIN' THE POINT. WHEN A LADY SAYS A THING, A GENTLEMAN'S GOT TO BELIEVE HER. IT WAS HIS GOING OUT OF HIS WAY TO BE SO MEAN. IT AIN'T THAT I BLAME HIM WHEN HE GETS MAD 'CAUSE I GET MAD, TOO! ARE YOU MAD NOW? BY JEEPERS, I'M GETTING TO BE. WELL, IF YOU GET MAD ENOUGH, WHY DON' YOU TRANSFER TO MR. WEAVER'S BOAT? HE NEEDS A COOK. OH, I COULD GET A JOB EASY ENOUGH. IT'S JUST THA HIS BOAT'S SO HANDY. I AIN'T WORKED UP ENOUGH YET. MAYBE KLORE WAS JUS SHOWING OFF IN FRONT OF YOU. WELL, I SUPPOSE I HAVE TO MAKE HIS BREAKFAST. SEE YOU WHEN THE FOG LIFTS. WELL, I HOPE SO, BUT MAYBE I WON'T. - WHY? - I MAY HIRE OUT TO MR. BUTTERFIELD. - TODAY? - IF HE GIVES ME THE JOB. OH. I JUST CAN' UNDERSTAND IT. A BIG STRONG FELLA LIKE YOU HANKERING FOR A FARM! HERE. HERE. YOU CAN' SLEEP HERE! GO IN YOUR OWN CABIN. I WAN MY BREAKFAST. YOU'LL GE YOUR BREAKFAST. - I WANT EGGS. - YOU'LL GET EGGS. OH. SO YOU THINK YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT I'M GONNA EAT, DO YOU? WELL, I WON' EAT EGGS! WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WANT... EGGS. BUT I WANT 'EM DIFFERENT. I'M SICK OF YOUR EGGS. BOILED EGGS AND FRIED EGGS. I WANT SOME BOILED FRIED EGGS! THAT'S WHAT I WANT. WELL, LISTEN, KLORE- YOU ARE DRUNK NOW. WHY DON'T YOU GO IN AND GET SOME SLEEP SO WE CAN GET OUTTA HERE THIS AFTERNOON. I AIN'T GOT A TASTE FOR THIS TOWN ANYMORE. - THERE YOU ARE, MR. HARROW. - THANKS. - MORNING, DAN. - MORNING, MRS. GURGET. KNOW MOLLY GOT IN LAST NIGHT? YES, MA'AM. SHE'S TIED UP TO OUR BOAT. HEY, LOOK OUT! NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, MOLLY. BE CAREFUL. HEY, DON'T THROW THOSE EGGS! HEY! LIKE FUN YOU WILL! WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOLLY? IT'S THIS HERE KLORE! HE'S GONE AND GOTTEN ME PRETTY MAD. I'VE STOOD JUS ABOUT ENOUGH OF HIM. HE AIN'T GONNA GIVE ME NO LICKING, AND I AIN'T WIPING NO EGG OFF OF HIS FACE! WHAT'S THE EGG DOING THERE? I PUT I THERE. MUST HAVE THROWN THE WHOLE DOZEN AT HIM. EXCUSE ME FOR MAKING YOU A WITNESS. IF I WAS YOU, I'D UP AND LEAVE HIM. THAT'S JUST WHAT I'M GONNA DO. I AIN'T NEVER BEEN ASHAMED OF MYSELF, AND I AIN'T GONNA BE ASHAMED OF ANYBODY I WORK FOR. GET YOUR THINGS AND COME ON TO ROME WITH US. I'LL SEE YOU LATER IN THE HOTEL. WELL, NOW THA YOU'VE QUIT KLORE, WHY DON'T YOU SIGN UP ON OUR BOAT? YOU'RE GOING ON A FARM. WILL THE COOKING BE GOOD ON A FARM? I GUESS NOT. DO YOU LIKE CHICKEN PIE? YES, MA'AM, I DO. WELL, I AIN'T BOASTFUL, MR. HARROW, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU COULD GE A BETTER CHICKEN-PIE MAKER THAN I AM. - AND GRIDDLE CAKES ON MORNINGS LIKE THIS? - I DO LIKE GRIDDLE CAKES. THEN WHY DON'T YOU STAY ON WITH MR. WEAVER A WHILE LONGER? I'D LIKE TO EAT YOUR COOKING, MA'AM, BUT I DON'T THINK THE CANAL'S EVER GONNA AMOUNT TO ANYTHING. - WHAT? - NO, MA'AM, I DON'T. NOT WITH THE RAILROADS COMING IN LIKE THEY ARE. YOU'RE FOR THE RAILROADS, TOO! WAIT A MINUTE, MA'AM, DON' GET YOUR DANDER UP AGAIN. - YOU'RE FOR THE RAILROADS! - NO, MA'AM, I AIN'T, BUT THEY'RE BUILDING RAILROADS ALL OVER NOW. THE PEOPLE AND GOODS FROM EUROPE CAN GO OUT WEST QUICKER ON THE RAILROADS THAN THEY CAN ON THE CANAL. THAT'S THE WAY THEY'RE BUILDING UP THE COUNTRY. NOW, DON'T GE YOUR DANDER UP. I AIN'T. I'LL NEVER GET ANYWHERE ON THE CANAL. I KNOW A LO ABOUT A FARM. MAYBE IF YOU HAD SOME GOOD CANAL COOKING YOU'D FEEL DIFFERENT. NO, MA'AM, I WOULDN'T. WELL, THERE'S NO NEED OF ME GOING ON MR. WEAVER'S BOAT THEN. HE'LL GE ANOTHER DRIVER. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'D LIKE HIM OR NOT. WELL, I GOT TO GET MY THINGS. BUFFALO GAL, CAN' YOU COME OUT TONIGHT?

KLORE IS AWAKE. THE MINUTE HE HEARS MOLLY SKIPPED, HE'LL WANNA FIGHT THE FIRST FELLA HE SEES. I JUST HAPPEN TO THINK I'VE GOT TO SEE IVY. SIT DOWN! MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IF KLORE DID GET IN A FIGHT. SAVE TROUBLE FOR MOLLY AND DAN. IF HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE MOLLY WENT, SEND HIM OVER TO THE AGENT. I- I'LL GO WITH YOU, MR. WEAVER. YOU'LL STAY RIGHT HERE. SOL, AIN'T NONE OF YOU GO NO BRISTLE ON YOUR BELLY WHERE KLORE IS CONCERNED. OH, HELLO, SHERIFF. HELLO, SAMSON! YOUR BROTHER'S A BOAT BUILDER, AIN'T HE? - AND A GOOD ONE. - I'M BUYING A NEW BOAT.

I WANT TO KNOW WHERE MY COOK IS AT. MOLLY'S QUIT YOU, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. - WHAT? - THAT'S IT- WHAT. - QUIT ME? - THAT'S RIGHT. - WHERE IS SHE? - SHE GOT ANOTHER JOB. ONLY THE AGENT KNOWS WHETHER SHE WENT EAST OR WEST, AND HE ALLOWS US HOW HE AIN'T GONNA TELL YOU. OH, HE AIN'T, AIN'T HE? YES, SIR. HE SAID YOU TELL HIM WHERE SHE WEN OR HE'D WIPE UP THE PLACE WITH YOU. OH, HE DID, HUH? HEY, FRED. KLORE'S COMING HERE TO WIPE UP THE PLACE. HEY, SEND JOE IN HERE. I WOULDN'T WAN TO SEE NO TROUBLE, BUT BY JEEPERS, IF KLORE STARTS A FIGHT, THE SHERIFF OUGHT TO PUT HIM IN THE LOCKUP. WELL, IF HE WANTS A FIGHT, HE'LL GET IT. WELL, JUST THOUGHT MAYBE I OUGHT TO TELL YOU. HUH. JOE, KLORE'S COMING HERE. HELLO, JOTHAM. YES, SIR, SHERIFF. I FIGURE ON A 96-FOO BOAT, ABOUT 150 TONS. YES. IS THA A FIGHT? IT WOULDN' SURPRISE ME.

AS FAR AS I KNOW, HE'S A PEACE WITH THE WORLD IN UTICA. PUT THE LAW ON HIM, SHERIFF! I'LL GET THAT DRIVER OF YOURS, MR. WEAVER. BUT YOU'LL SPEND 90 DAYS IN THE LOCKUP FIRST. I THINK IT WAS WRONG TO GET IN A FIGHT, JOTHAM. OH, LOOK! JEEPERS CREEPERS. OH, LOOKIT, FATHER! HERE'S ANOTHER BOAT! HELLO! THEY MUST BE THE PEOPLE SAMSON WEAVER WAS TELLING ME ABOUT. WHERE ARE THEY GOING? MISSOURI FIRST. THEY'LL SPEND THE WINTER THERE. IN THE SPRING, THEY'LL MEE UP WITH A LOT MORE WAGONS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. THEN THEY'LL START OU ACROSS THE PRAIRIES, ALL THE WAY OU TO CALIFORNIA. - WHAT FOR? - SOME OF THEM AFTER GOLD, I GUESS. OTHERS JUS TO MAKE NEW HOMES. IT'S EXCITING JUST TO THINK OF IT, AIN'T IT? THEY'LL HAVE TO FIGH INDIANS AND WILD ANIMALS. IT'LL BE DANGEROUS. THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK HARD, AND THERE'LL BE HARDSHIPS FOR THEM TO FACE. A MAN'LL SUFFER A MIGHTY HEAP TO GET LAND HE CAN CALL HIS OWN. - ANGUS? - AYE? A HA'PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS. OH, THEY'RE WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I WAS THINKING OF BONNIE SCOTLAND. MAN, WE'VE COME A LONG WAY FROM HOME, HARRIET. THE FURTHER WE GET FROM THE OLD HOME, THE NEARER WE GET TO THE NEW. WELL, THERE'LL ALWAYS BE SCOTLAND FOR YOU TO GO BACK TO. AND FOR ME, THERE'LL ALWAYS BE YORKSHIRE. BUT FIRST, THERE'S A NEW HOME TO ME, AND IT'S A GREAT COUNTRY WE'LL MAKE IT INTO. SO DON'T BE DOWNHEARTED, ANGUS. IF WE'RE RICH, WE CAN GO BACK IF WE STILL HAVE THE HEART FOR IT.

THERE NOW. GET SOME FRESH AIR. MAYBE I BETTER TAKE A LOOK AT THAT KITTEN'S TEETH. YOU KEEP AWAY FROM HER TEETH. SHE'S ALL RIGHT. AND LOOK AT THE WAY SHE'S GROWING. CAN YOU REALIZE IT'S THREE MONTHS SINCE I'VE COME WITH DAN? I AIN'T NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY. I WONDER IF JOTHAM KLORE GOT OUT OF JAIL YET. DO YOU THINK THERE'LL BE TROUBLE WHEN HIM AND DAN MEET? WELL, IT'S JUST AS WELL MAYBE THAT THEY DIDN'T MEET. BUT THE FUNNY THING ABOUT DAN, HE DON'T LIKE TO FIGHT. OF COURSE SOME WOMEN WOULD MIND THAT. I DON'T. I DON'T EVEN MIND HIM NOT CUSSING. OH, FORTUNE, I AM IN LOVE WITH HIM. HMM. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE PUTTING UP ALL THOSE PRESERVES FOR THE WHITESBORO FAIR, EH? WELL, LUCY SAID THAT ONLY FARM PEOPLE SENT THEIR COOKING, SO I THOUGHT IF I COULD WIN A PRIZE WITH MY PRESERVES, IT'D PROVE TO DAN THAT CANAL FOLK CAN DO THINGS, TOO. OH, THE GRAND PASSION, AS THE FRENCH CALL IT, IS A STRANGE THING. WEREN'T YOU EVER IN LOVE, FORTUNE? WHEN I WAS YOUNG. SHE WAS A CHARMING LADY. SHE WAS A SNAKE CHARMER WITH A CARNIVAL. WE WERE AWFULLY FOND OF EACH OTHER. IN FACT, SHE TOLD ME SHE LOVED ME MORE THAN SHE DID HER SNAKES. BUT I SORT OF RESENTED BEING THE RIVAL TO REPTILES, - AND JUST LE THE MATTER DROP. HEY, MOLLY. I'LL GET TO THE FAIR A DAY BEFORE YOU DO. I BETTER TAKE YOUR PRESERVES ON OUR BOAT SO THEY'RE ON TIME. I TAKE THAT VERY KINDLY, LUCY. - IT'S A GOOD IDEA. - I'LL GET THEM READY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. I'D LIKE TO SEE DAN AND HER LEAVE TOWN AS QUICK AS THEY CAN. - KLORE? - HE GOT OUT OF JAIL THREE DAYS AGO. HE'S COMING WEST. DO YOU SMELL ANYTHING? WE'RE COMING INTO ROME. I'VE NEVER SMELLED ROME BEFORE. WHEN DID YOU GE OUT OF JAIL, JOTHAM? WEDNESDAY. WHAT YOU HAULIN'? GOT A CARGO OF RIFLES AND BULLETS GOING OUT WES TO FORT LARAMIE. I GUESS THE INDIANS ARE ON THE WARPATH AGAIN. HEAR YOU PUT UP QUITE A FIGHT YOURSELF IN UTICA. SAY, DID I. IT WAS ASTONISHING. I TOOK SEVEN MEN TO PUT ME IN JAIL. - WHERE ARE YOU HAULING? - SYRACUSE. THEN I'M COMING BACK TO THE ONEIDA FAIR. WHY, JEEPERS, THERE'S SOMETHING SMELLING AROUND HERE. HEY, OTWAY! YOU SMELLING UP THERE? WELL, IT AIN'T WHA YOU'D CALL A SMELLY SMELL. PULL OVER TO THAT SHORE. I'M A-GOING BY YOU. OH, PLEASE, MR. KLORE. YOU HEARD ME, DIDN'T YOU? AND DON'T GIVE ME NONE OF YOUR LIP. YOU DON'T NEED A BOA FOR THEM HOGS. YOU COULD FLOAT THEM INTO SYRACUSE ON THEIR OWN SMELL. OH... HI, MR. ROBERTS. - HI. - BOAT ON YOUR WAY EAST? THEY WERE LOADING YESTERDAY IN ONEIDA. SHORT-HAULING WEST. DON'T FORGET NOW, IF YOU HEAR OF ANYBODY WHO WANTS SOME GOLD TEETH, - TELL THEM ABOUT ME. - I'LL TELL THEM. HERE YOU ARE, LUCY. LAND'S SAKES! YOU MUS HAVE FIXED ABOUT 15 KINDS. SAY, IF THEY'RE ONLY HALF THE KIND YOU MAKE, THE PRIZE IS ALREADY YOURS. AW, SHUCKS. YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT. ARE WE LOADED YET? JUST ABOUT. WHERE YOU BEEN? MR. BUTTERFIELD'S ON BUSINESS. - ABOUT THE BOAT. - WELL, IN A WAY. WE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF HERE IN ABOUT A HALF HOUR. I HAVE THE URGE TO RIDE THE HORSES WITH FORTUNE. WELL, I RECKON FORTUNE WON'T OBJECT TO THAT. I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA HAULING THAT LUMBER FOR THEM RAILROADS. - IT PAYS WELL. - I HATE DOING ANYTHING FOR THEM. THE CANAL AIN'T GONNA BE WHIPPED, IS IT, FORTUNE? IT'S A FUNNY AGE. NO LIKE WHEN I WAS YOUNG. EVERYBODY'S CRAZY FOR SPEED TODAY. DO THINGS FASTER AND GET THERE QUICKER. THE RAILROADS WILL GIVE THEM MORE SPEED, ALL RIGHT, BUT THEY'LL MAKE THE PEOPLE FORGET HOW FINE THE WORLD COULD GO AT FOUR MILES AN HOUR. THE RAILROAD'LL NEVER LICK THE CANAL. I JUST AIN' GONNA THINK ABOUT IT. WE'LL SOON BE AT THOSE LOCKS WHERE DAN ALWAYS TAKES YOU WALKING. IF I WAS YOU, I'D ONLY THINK OF THAT. YOU KNOW, FORTUNE, I THINK DAN'S GETTING TO LIKE THE CANAL. PRETTY, AIN'T IT? THE NICEST SIGH I EVER SEE IS THE CANAL IN THE EARLY MORNING WITH THE MIST RISING. GOSH, I NEVER NOTICE HOW PRETTY THE CANAL IS WHEN YOU'RE ON THE BOAT. - WHY? - 'CAUSE YOU'RE SO DANG SWEET-LOOKING YOURSELF. - OH. - YOU ARE. GOSH, MOLLY, I AIN' NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY. I TOLD THA TO FORTUNE MYSELF. JUST TODAY. OH, YOU. I WAS FORGETTING- I GOT NEWS. - WHAT? - COME ON, SIT DOWN. I ADDED UP MY BOOKS THIS MORNING. WE MADE A LOT MORE THAN I FIGURED WE WOULD. - OH, DAN. - MAYBE WE COULD GET MARRIED NOW. ALL RIGHT, AND YOU CAN BUY THE OTHER HALF OF THE BOAT, CAN'T YOU? BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER WAN TO LEAVE THE CANAL NOW. OH... - I THOUGHT- - I'M SORRY I BROKE MY PROMISE, DAN. IT'S NOTHING. DO YOU WANNA TALK SOME MORE ABOUT GETTING MARRIED? MAYBE IT'D BE BETTER IF WE DIDN'T NOW, HUH? ALL RIGHT. DAN, YOU'LL GE YOUR HANDS ALL DIRTY. - THIS IS SOIL. - IT'S DIRT. YEAH, BUT SOIL AIN'T DIRTY. IT'S CLEAN AND SWEET-SMELLING. MY PA USED TO SAY IF IT WASN'T FOR THE SOIL, THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY WORLD. IT GIVES US LIFE. GROWS THINGS FOR US TO LIVE BY. GROWS GRASS FOR THE CATTLE TO GRAZE ON SO'S WE COULD HAVE MEAT TO EAT, TREES AND FLOWERS THA ARE PRETTY TO LOOK AT. I RECKON, MOLLY, NOBODY'D BE ALIVE IF IT WASN'T FOR SOIL. YES, BUT YOU NEED WATER TO LIVE BY, TOO. YOU GET WATER FROM THE SOIL - DIG A WELL. YOU AIN'T SETTING TO TALK ABOUT A FARM, ARE YOU? NO. THERE WAS A FUNNY LOOK ON YOUR FACE JUST NOW WHEN YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT GETTING MARRIED. - NOW, DON'T GET YOUR DANDER UP. - IF I THOUGHT- WE GOTTA GET BACK. YOU KNOW, MOLLY, IF WE GET UNLOADED BY TOMORROW, WE'LL GET TO THE FAIR BY THURSDAY. - HELLO, MISS LARKINS! - HELLO, DELLA! WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THAT COW? AW, SHE'S GONNA WIN THE PRIZE FOR HAVING THE MOST MILK. I'M TAKING HER TO THE FAIR. IT'S MR. BUTTERFIELD'S. - YOU'RE TAKING HER? - WELL, YOU'RE A-HELPING ME, BUT I'M A-TAKING HER. HOW MUCH MILK DOES SHE GIVE? SHE DON'T GIVE ANY. YOU HAVE TO SQUEEZE IT. BYE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING, FORTUNE? NOTHING. WELL, STOP THAT. IF I DON'T GET A DENTAL CASE PRETTY SOON, I'M GONNA TAKE OU SOME OF MY OWN TEETH. MAYBE YOU'LL GET SOME CASES AT THE FAIR. MOLLY, THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA. IF MY COOKING SHOULD WIN A PRIZE, I'D BE THE HAPPIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD, JUST FOR DAN'S SAKE. GOSH, MOLLY, THE FAIR IS WONDERFUL. - WHAT'S THEM, BOOKS? - YEAH. AND A PRESEN FOR YOU. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW PRETTY YOU LOOK. IT'S LOVELY! BUT IT'S SO BIG. OH, IT SORT OF TOOK MY FANCY AT THE STORE. - PUT YOUR NEW DRESS ON. - ALL RIGHT. WE WANT TO GET TO THE GROUNDS RIGHT AWAY. SAY, MOLLY, IT'S LIVELY THERE AS ALL GET OUT. JEEPERS CREEPERS! WHAT A CAKE. THAT'S A CHAMPEEN. YOU'VE HAD SOME LIKE IT. I JUST MADE THE FROSTING THICKER. I AIN'T SEEN ANYTHING AS NICE AS THAT SINCE MY MA WAS ALIVE. MOLLY AIN'T GO THE REPUTATION FOR BEING THE BEST COOK ON THE CANAL FOR NOTHING. OH, IT'S JUS A CRAZY OLD CAKE. WE'RE GONNA TAKE I TO THE FAIR WITH US. YOU KNOW, DAN, YOU BOUGHT SUCH A BIG OVEN. I HAVE TO USE I FOR SOMETHING. FORTUNE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DIFFERENT KIND OF SNUFF, I GUESS, THAN WHAT I BEEN USING. THERE! YOU'RE ABOUT AS PRETTY AS ANYTHING I EVER SEEN. MY MY, I'M GOING TO BE SO DANG PROUD OF YOU AT THE FAIR. YOU LIKE FAIRS, DON'T YOU, DAN? OH, COUNTRY FOLK THINK THERE'S NOTHING SO FINE AS A FAIR. THE CANAL HAS ITS CELEBRATIONS, TOO. THEY SAY THERE WAS NOTHING EVER SO FINE AS THE ONE WHEN THE ERIE OPENED. YOU WERE THERE, FORTUNE. TELL US ABOUT IT. - OH, I'VE TOLD YOU. - I WANT DAN TO HEAR. WELL, ALL RIGHT. IT WAS IN 1825. THERE WAS CANNONS STRUNG OU WITHIN AN EARSHOT OF EACH OTHER ALL ALONG THE CANAL. THE MINUTE IT WAS OPEN AND THE WATER CAME IN FROM LAKE ERIE, FIRST MUDDY AND SLOW LIKE A LITTLE CREEK, THE GUNS WENT OFF ONE AFTER ANOTHER ALL THE WAY TO NEW YORK. THEY HAD THE NEWS THERE 80 MINUTES LATER. THEN THE GUNS STARTED FIRING ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN. IN ABOUT AN HOUR, WE KNEW THA NEW YORK KNEW ALL ABOUT IT. WHEN THE CANAL WAS FILLED, THE FIRST BOAT TO MOVE ON HER WAS GOVERNOR CLINTON'S. SHE WAS PAINTED ALL RED AND WHITE AND DRAWN BY FOUR MATCHED GRAYS. BUT WHAT EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING A WAS A BEAUTIFUL KEG STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF HER DECK. IT HAD THE AMERICAN EAGLE PAINTED ON I AND THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER WRAPPED ALL OVER IT. IT WAS A BARREL OF WATER FROM LAKE ERIE TO BE EMPTIED IN NEW YORK BAY. IT WAS QUITE A SIGHT TO SEE. WASN'T THA WONDERFUL, DAN? I BET IT WAS. COME ON, I CAN'T WAI TO GET BACK TO THE FAIR. - I'LL WRAP UP THE CAKE. - OH SURE, BUT LET'S HURRY. MOLLY, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A FAIR FOR LIVESTOCK. THERE'S EVERY KIND OF BREED OF CATTLE. FIRST HOLSTEINS I'VE EVER SEEN IN NEW YORK STATE. IT'LL MAKE HISTORY, AND THEY SAY THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF'S GONNA BE THERE, AND THAT RICH MR. VANDERBILT FROM NEW YORK'S GONNA MAKE A SPEECH. YOU MEAN THAT RAILROAD FELLA? WELL, THEY CALL HIM COMMODORE VANDERBILT. HE OWNS A FLEET OF FERRY BOATS ON THE HUDSON. I'LL BE UP ON DECK. THERE'S BEEN SOME FINE, BIG STALLIONS PASSING BY HERE. FARMIN' AND CATTLE RAISIN'! COME ON OUT, MOLLY! JEEPERS CREEPERS! THERE'S ABOUT A MILLION INDIANS COMING! YOU COME FAIR? WE GO WASHINGTON AND SEE GREAT WHITE FATHER SMOKING PIPE OF PEACE. OLD TREATY END. NEW TREATY COME. YOU'RE GOING TO WASHINGTON TO MAKE A NEW TREATY WITH THE GOVERNMENT. MAKE BIG TALK WITH GREAT WHITE FATHER. LIVE NOW IN PEACE 20 WINTERS WITH WHITE BROTHER. LEAVE IN PEACE MORE. NEW TREATY. - DID HE SAY NEW "TEETHY?" - NEW TREATY. OH, I THOUGHT HE SAID HE WANTED SOME NEW TEETH. THAT'S MY PROFESSION- ME FIX BAD TEETHY. NOW, IF ANY OF YOUR BOYS SHOULD WANT ME TO FIX THEM- HMM-MM. NO. NO. JUST MY LUCK! IF I'D HAVE GOT HERE SOONER, I MIGHT HAVE GOT SOME BUSINESS. IT'S THE BEST COLOGNE YOU COULD BUY, MY BOY, STRAIGHT FROM PARIS- EVERY BOTTLE, GENUINE FRENCH COLOGNE.

JOTHAM KLORE'S GETTING HIS FORTUNE TOLD. - AND DANIEL HARROW'S HERE, TOO. - OOH. AH, WITHIN ONE, I SEE ONE. ONE DAY, ONE WEEK, ONE YEAR. YOU WILL BE IN A TERRIBLE FIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A GLASS LOOKER TO TELL ME THAT. - I'M JOTHAM KLORE. - AH. I SEE A TERRIFIC STRUGGLE. YOU EXCHANGE BLOWS. YOUR BODY IS PITTED AGAINST ANOTHER BODY. THERE IS BLOOD. WHO'S GONNA WIN? THE CRYSTAL DOES NOT SAY WHO WILL. YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T SEE ME WINNING IN THERE? - I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. - YOU'RE A LIAR! AH, MY DEAR SIR.

THAT PROVES YOU'RE A LIAR 'CAUSE I AIN'T GONNA GIVE YOU NOTHING! TELL ME HE CAN'T SEE. SAY, JOTHAM, THEY GOT ONE OF THOSE NEW RAILROAD CARS DOWN HERE A PIECE. I AIN'T INTERESTED. ONLY ONE THING ON MY MIND, AND THAT'S YOUR PARTNER, DANIEL HARROW. I AIM TO MEET HIM AROUND HERE SOMETIME TODAY. YEAH, BUT THIS HERE CAR WAS PU THERE JUST TO INSULT THE CANAL. - WHO'S INSULTING THE CANAL? - THE RAILROAD PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY THE CAR IS THERE- SO THEY'D HAVE THE LAUGH ON US. - WHERE IS IT? - COME ON, COME ON. I DO HOPE WE GET THE CAKE IN BEFORE THE CONTEST CLOSES. I'M SO MAD I COULD FIGHT A DOG! - WHAT'S THE MATTER? - THEY WOULDN'T TAKE YOUR PRESERVES. GOOD GRIEF! ARE THEY AS BAD AS THAT? IT'S ALL ON ACCOUNT OF YOU AIN' A RESIDENT OF ONEIDA COUNTY. WHEN THE FELLA TOLD ME THAT, I JUST STARTED TO BLISTER. I SAYS, "WHAT KIND OF WAY IS THIS TO RUN A CONTEST, YOU WART?" THIS AIN'T A FAIR. IT'S AN UNFAIR. IT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR COOKING. WHY, THERE WAS NEVER ANYBODY COULD COOK LIKE YOU, MOLLY. I'D FEEL TERRIBLE IF IT WAS BECAUSE MY COOKING WAS BAD. NO. I WENT TO SEE THE MAN IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING. I TOLD HIM THE SAME THING. I SAID, "DO YOU REALIZE CANALLERS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING HIS FAIR SINCE BEFORE YOU WAS CALVED?" IT MADE NO IMPRESSION. I COULD HAVE SLAPPED HIS FACE. - OH, MR. HARROW. - HELLO, MR. BUTTERFIELD. COULD I SEE YOU A MOMENT? OH, EXCUSE ME, PLEASE. MOLLY, THERE'S SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN PICKLES- KLORE'S AT THE FAIR, AND HE'S LOOKING FOR A FIGHT. DAN AIN' AFRAID OF HIM. IF HE WANTS TROUBLE, DAN'LL GIVE HIM PLENTY. I'LL BET MY BOATER WILL BE GLAD THAT HE'S AROUND. I HAPPEN TO SEE YOU HERE, AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL TELL YOU MYSELF. THANK YOU KINDLY, MR. BUTTERFIELD. I SURE APPRECIATE IT. I'D GET OUT AS QUICK AS YOU CAN NOW. YES, SIR, I WILL. I'LL SEE YOU IN UTICA THEN. YES, SIR. THERE AIN'T A COWARDLY BONE IN DAN'S WHOLE BODY.

ARE YOU SCARED OF KLORE? WHAT PUT THA IN YOUR HEAD? A WHILE A GO YOU WAS ALL PERKED UP AND CRAZY TO GO TO THE FAIR. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU WANNA GET OUTTA HERE AND GO BACK TO UTICA. WELL, I MIGH GET A LOAD IN UTICA- DID YOU KNOW KLORE WAS HERE? I WAS TOLD THIS MORNING. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY YOU NONE. DON'T YOU THINK IT'D WORRY ME A LOT MORE TO KNOW MY BOATER WAS A COWARD? HOW AM I A COWARD? YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY. WELL, I- I GOTTA BE IN UTICA TOMORROW. TO GET AWAY FROM KLORE. NO, IT'S... SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT? IT'S SOMETHING WE SAID WE WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT. ABOUT A FARM? LISTEN, MOLLY - WE'VE BEEN MIGHTY HAPPY ALL SUMMER. DON'T LET'S SPOIL IT NOW. DAN, DID YOU GO AND BUY A FARM? YES, I DID. I OFFERED MR. BUTTERFIELD A PRICE LAST WEEK, AND HE SAID HE'D THINK ABOUT IT. TODAY HE SAID HE'D TAKE IT. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GO BACK TO UTICA - TO SEE HIS AGENT. I SAID THAT ABOUT A LOAD ON ACCOUNT OF LUCY BEING THERE. THEN ALL THE TIME YOU WAS ON THE CANAL, ALL THE TIME THE BOATERS WAS BEING NEIGHBORLY AND FRIENDLY, THE ONLY THING ON YOUR MIND WAS YOU WAS BUYING A FARM! I SAID FROM THE BEGINNING I DIDN' THINK I COULD STAY ON THE CANAL. YOU NEVER GAVE THE CANAL A CHANCE. YOU NEVER BOTHERED TO NOTICE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS. YOU NEVER NOTICED YOU'VE BEEN HAPPIER HERE THAN YOU EVER BEEN IN YOUR LIFE. THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU. NO, IT AIN'T. IT'S BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PLAY FAIR. THIS PROVES IT. ALL THEM THINGS YOU'VE BEEN BUYING FOR THE BOAT! THINGS THAT WAS TOO BIG FOR THE BOAT! THAT LOOKING GLASS, THAT KITCHEN OVEN. YOU KNEW ALL THE TIME YOU WAS BUYING THEM FOR A DIRTY OLD FARM. EVEN THIS DRESS! I BET YOU BOUGHT THIS TO GO TO CHURCH IN! WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D GET MARRIED IN IT. I'LL NEVER MARRY YOU NOW. I JUST THINK YOU'RE ACTING CRAZY. MOLLY, YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THERE AIN'T ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU EXCEPT THIS, AND IT'S JUST 'CAUSE I CAN'T DO IT. WILL YOU COME AND LE ME SHOW YOU THE FARM? ME AT A FARM? DO YOU THINK I'M A TRAITOR? EVEN KLORE WOULDN'T ASK ME TO DO THAT! I THOUGH HE WAS MEAN, BUT HE'S NOTHING AS COMPARED TO YOU. YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT 'CAUSE YOU'RE MAD. HE NEVER LIED TO ME. I NEVER LIED TO YOU. IN YOUR HEAR YOU DID. YOU WERE SAYING ONE THING, AND ALL THE TIME THINKING ANOTHER. AT LEAS KLORE WAS HONEST. MAYBE YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT HIM. MAYBE I SHOULDN'T! WELL, IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU FEEL, THERE'S NOTHING GONNA STOP YOU FROM GOING BACK TO HIM. BY JEEPERS, I CAN GET MY DANDER UP, TOO. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I GOT SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU I AIN'T SO MEAN. FROM NOW ON, MY HALF OF THE BOAT IS YOURS. I WON'T TAKE IT. WHERE'S DANIEL HARROW'S BOAT? OH, QUITE A PIECE DOWN THERE. OVER THE BRIDGE. THE BOAT WAS ONLY MINE IF I STAYED ON THE CANAL. WELL, I'M GOING, SO NOW IT'S YOURS. WHETHER YOU MARRY ME OR NOT, I DON' THINK YOU'LL BE HAULING MANY SEASONS MORE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GONNA TRAVEL 4 MILES AN HOUR WHEN THEY CAN GO 20? TIME'S HAVE CHANGED, BUT YOU'RE SO BLINDED BY THE CANAL YOU CAN'T SEE IT. THINGS AIN'T LIKE THEY WAS 25 YEARS AGO. IN ANOTHER 25 YEARS, THEY WON'T BE LIKE THEY ARE NOW. THAT'S PROGRESS, AND THAT'S WHAT'LL LICK THE ERIE. NOTHING CAN LICK THE ERIE! I MAY MISS YOU, BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, I'LL SEE THE ERIE GROWING EVEN MORE WONDERFUL, HAULING THINGS EAS AND HAULING THINGS WEST. AND I'LL BE ON MY BOA SEEING IT ALL HAPPEN. THAT'S MORE THAN YOU'LL BE! YOU'RE SO SURE OF EVERYTHING. I'M SURE OF ONE THING I'LL BE ON MY FARM GROWING THINGS FOR THE TRAINS TO HAUL. SOIL WON'T CHANGE. THAT'S JUS AS IT WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE BECAUSE LIFE COMES FROM THE SOIL AND LIFE WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME. JEEPERS, IT'S THE MOS I EVER TALKED IN MY LIFE. YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE ON THE ERIE! IF YOU EVER WANT ME, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE PLACE WHERE I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME. THAT'S THE FARM I BOUGHT, MOLLY. - THE FARM YOU WON'T EVEN COME TO SEE. THAT'S THE TRAIN. I GOTTA HURRY. RUNNING AWAY, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. JUST LIKE A COWARD! THAT'S ALL I COULD EXPECT FROM A MAN THAT DIDN'T LIKE THE ERIE! IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING IN THE WORLD. WHY COULDN'T HE SEE THAT? IS THAT DANIEL HARROW THAT JUST LEFT HERE? YES, BUT YOU CAN' CATCH HIM. HE GO ON THAT TRAIN. I'LL BET HE DID THA JUST TO INSULT THE CANAL! RUNNING AWAY FROM A FIGHT, EH? FUNNY FELLA YOU'D PICKED FOR A BOATER, MOLLY. YOU AIN'T MUCH LIKE YOUR PA. HE'D NEVER LET A COWARD WORK FOR HIM. SAY, BOSS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE MAYBE TONIGHT BY SUPPER? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? STEAK. GUESS I'LL HAVE TO LIKE STEAK. THEY SMELL GOOD, MOLLY. I DON'T SEEM TO TAKE ANY COMFORT IN COOKING ANYMORE. I GUESS MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING THE SEASON'S OVER TOMORROW. - CANAL'S CLOSING. - YOU'RE TIRED. OF COURSE, DAN LEAVING, THAT PU A LOT OF WORK ON YOUR SHOULDERS. I'M USED TO WORK. IT AIN'T THAT- IT'S THE FACT THAT I COULD EVER BE IN LOVE WITH A COWARD. AFTER ALL, MOLLY, YOU DON' REALLY KNOW THAT DAN IS A COWARD. - HE RUN AWAY, DIDN'T HE? - HE WENT AWAY. HE RUN AWAY. THAT'S WHAT I CAN' FORGIVE HIM. MAYBE IN TIME I COULD HAVE GOTTEN USED TO HIS WANTING A FARM. BUT BEING A COWARD, IT'S JUST AGAIN' MY NATURE. AND ANYWAY, I AIN' UNHAPPY OVER HIM. - NO. - NO. - NO. - LIKE YOU SAID, I'M JUST TUCKERED OUT, THAT'S ALL. THAT'S IT. WHEN YOU GET TO ROME TOMORROW, YOU CAN TAKE A GOOD REST. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, FORTUNE? WHO ME? I GOT SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO. I'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE TRIP, I GUESS. WHOA! WHOA. HELLO, FORTUNE. HOW ARE YOU, DAN? - DOING YOUR FALL PLOWING? - YEAH. I SEEN THE BUGGY COMING ALONG, AND I THOUGHT MAYBE- - IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE? - YEAH. - MOLLY? - YEAH. SHE'S IN ROME. I HAD SOME BUSINESS UP THE ROAD A PIECE AND THOUGH I'D SEE YOU. - HOW IS SHE? - OH, YOU MIGHT SAY IN ONE WAY SHE IS AND ANOTHER WAY SHE AIN'T. SORT OF A YES OR NO PROPOSITION. - SHE AIN'T SICK? - WORRIED. - ABOUT WHAT? - MOLLY'S A PROUD LITTLE THING, AND IT KIND OF HURTS YOU TO SEE PEOPLE SNEERING, I GUESS. - WHO'S SNEERING AT HER? - CANAL FOLK. - WHY? - OH, THEY'LL FORGET ABOUT IT IN TIME. - PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER. - FORGET WHAT? OH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT? WELL, YOU SEE, THEY'RE ALL SORT OF STICKING THEIR NOSES UP AT MOLLY. SOME OF THEM WON'T EVEN SPEAK TO HER AT ALL. I HEARD SOL TINKER MYSELF INSUL THE GIRL RIGHT TO HER FACE. - INSULT MOLLY? - YES. ABOUT WHAT? CANALLERS HAVEN'T ANY USE FOR ANYONE THAT EVER WORKED FOR A COWARD. THEY THINK I RUN AWAY? AND MOLLY HAS TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF IT. YOU SEE, MOLLY'S PA WAS A FIGHTER, AND SO WAS KLORE. THEN AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU, WELL, THEY SAY THAT MOLLY AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH ANYMORE TO WORK FOR A REAL MAN. THERE AIN'T A MAN ON THE CANAL THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MOLLY, - THAT'S WHAT. - THAT'S WHAT I THINK. BUT IT'S HARD FOR A GIRL TO LOSE THE RESPECT OF HER FRIENDS, EVEN THOUGH THERE AIN'T NO CAUSE FOR IT. ABOUT THE ONLY ONE THAT PAYS ANY NOTICE TO HER AT ALL IS KLORE. - KLORE? - YES. HE'S ALWAYS GO A BIG SMILE FOR HER, BUT MAYBE HE'S ONLY GLOATING. YOU NEVER CAN TELL. AND SHE'S BEING INSULTED JUS 'CAUSE I DIDN'T FIGHT HIM. NOW, HOW DID I EVER GET ON THAT SUBJECT? I'M JUST AN OLD FUSSBUDGET, I GUESS, WHO NEVER SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT. IS KLORE IN ROME? YES, HE STOPS A MOLLY'S BOAT REAL OFTEN. WELL, I MUST GET ON. I'M GONNA BE IN ROME MYSELF TOMORROW. - NO, ARE YOU, DAN? - YEAH. BUYING MR. WEAVER'S HORSES. - WELL, I'LL SEE YOU. - YEAH. SO LONG.

I GUESS I DID FEEL A LITTLE MEAN AT THE FAIR WHEN YOU RAN AWAY. I DIDN' RUN AWAY. I HAD TO GO SEE ABOUT MY FARM. I DON'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT THE FARM. GOSH, MOLLY, I WISH YOU COULD JUST SEE IT. - IT'S GOT THE BEST SOIL- - YOU DIDN'T COME HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT. NO, I DIDN'T, BUT NOW THAT I'M SEEING YOU AGAIN, I CAN'T HELP TALKING ABOUT IT. IT'S ALL I THOUGHT OF EVER SINCE I BEEN ON IT- JUST HOW FINE IT'D BE IF YOU WAS UP THERE. I'LL NEVER BE THERE. EVEN IF YOU COULD COME FOR THE WINTER, MOLLY. IF YOU STILL LIKE THE CANAL, YOU CAN COME BACK WHEN IT OPENS UP. I COULDN'T GO WITH A MAN I DIDN'T RESPECT. WELL, I AIN' DONE ANYTHING- YOU RUN AWAY, AND THAT'S WHAT HURT ME SO. NOT THAT YOU WAS LEAVING THE CANAL. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THAT IN TIME. BUT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY, YOU RAN AWAY. AND EVERYBODY KNEW HOW I FELT ABOUT YOU.

HERE COMES DANIEL HARROW! DON'T GO DOWN THERE, DAN, PLEASE. IT'S WHAT I COME FOR - TO MEET KLORE. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT. I GUESS I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF ALL RIGHT. BUT NOT WITH KLORE. HE'S BEEN FIGHTING ALL HIS LIFE. NOBODY'S EVER LICKED HIM. IT AIN'T A MATCH. I AIN'T NO WEAKLING NEITHER. I CLEARED FIVE ACRES OF WOODLAND ALL BY MYSELF IN ONE MONTH, AND I PLANTED IT, TOO. GOSH, MOLLY, THE COUNTRY'S BEAUTIFUL IN THE FALL. THERE IT SMELLS SO SWEET. BUT KLORE'S TERRIBLE WHEN HE'S MAD! I'M GETTING ME SOME APPLE TREES, TOO. DAN, MAYBE YOU'LL BE KILLED! I GOT THE SOUTH FIELD ALL SOWN WITH RED-BUSH CLOVER AND A CLOVER OF CROP OATS. OH, DON'T FIGHT DAN. PLEASE DON'T.
