Where's he working? -Why did they ask you to go there? Is it because...? -Because of what? -You said they might be checking on you? -Is he here?-Who? -My late father, that tenant - who else! -No. -Where is he? -Ilija, what happened? -Nothing... ...just not yet. -Will you finally tell me why they asked you to go there? -Because of him. -Because of him? -Have I told you we don't need a tenant? -You have. -Yes, I've told you 100 times... ...but you insisted as if we're starving, so you did it, but you did me in too! -Who placed this sanatorium here?!! - I've always told you what to do and what not to do. But you don't listen. -Do you know who he is? -You mean, by vocation? -By everything!!! -He told me he was a tailor in Paris, and now he wants to open a shop here. -OK, and? -And what? -Who is he, what's he doing here? -I don't ask, he doesn't say, he pays on time... -How does he afford rent? -Tell me what happened there, Ilija! -That man, our tenant, Petar Markov Jakovljevic, that tenant with three names... ...is a mean and dangerous man. Police's been watching him for a long time... ...they asked me what he is doing, who are his friends and who's visiting him... -Who did you talk to? -With a police inspector... -He told you he's dangerous? -No. -How come you know he is dangerous? -Police never inquires about a good and honest man.. -As soon as he comes back, we'll give him notice, he'll pack and leave... -I told the same to inspector, but he said not to make fuss about it... ...he said he's just suspicious for now. He's probably done something... ...against our country. If he was common criminal, they would got him by now... -Did you tell inspector about your heart? -Are you nuts, he's not a doctor! -Than I asked him, because I can see he didn't tell me everything, I said "Comrade..." ...are you suspecting me? You know I was in prison for two years.. -He said "I didn't know that". But on his table, there was this thick blue folder... ...with coffee stains all over.... My case, for sure. -You'd never tell he's inspector, he's.. ...tidy, well dressed, you know... in my time, you could recognize them from afar. That was their tactic, as soon as you see him, you know who is he. Today, you can't tell who they are. That way it seems there's more of them. He also asked me how we're handling inflation? I said, excellent... ..we accepted stabilization,it's a holly thing for us. Well, Danica... ..he also asked me did he receieve any phone calls from Paris, I said... ...so far no one called him...-What are you saying, they called him... -When??? -A few times... -Jesus, why didn't you tell me?!? -I didn't know it was important. -It is!! If I told them there were no calls, they'll think I'm working for them! -Hallo,can I speak with Comrade Drazic? Ah, it's you...Ilija Cvorovic speaking... I came by this morning for medical... Oh, sorry, I frequently go to the doctor's. ...I told you no one called him but my wife just told me they called him...a few times. -I've told you our conversation was purely informative, don't worry, good bye. -Good bye... -What did he say? -Not to get upset, easy for him when that villain isn't in his house. -When did you clean his room last time? -Yesterday. -Give me the key! -What for? -Give me the key! -Let's go... -"Petite paquette"... ...some kind of medication? -He's a diabetic, his brother sends him insuline every month from Paris. -Stay on watch! -This is just a plain calculator. -Yes, I can see, I'm not blind... During the war I saw watches and pens that blow up and cut off hands -How big is our savings? -We don't have any savings! -And do you know how much he saved? -He worked for 20 years abroad... -How long have I worked? My whole life. -They pay well over there. -"Over there"? You think he earned this... ...French are paying US dollars to our "famous couturier"!!! -Here he comes! -Put on coffee, no sugar for him and be carefull... ...behave as always, quietly, kindly... ...and don't say something stupid. -Comrade Jakovljevic, hello! -Hello, sir. -How about some coffee, it's been a while. -I just told my wife this Jakovljevic seems to avoid us... -Are you mad at us?? -No, it's just that I'm constantly in a hurry. -Please do come in. -Stay for 5 minutes, have some coffee. -All right. -A cigarette? -Ah, no thank you I don't smoke. -So, how's your health? -Comrade Cvorovic, only my illness serves me well, nothing else does. -How about your work? -I'm going completely crazy, Mr. Cvorovic... -What's the problem? Maybe we can help? -It's been 9 months since they've promised me a location for my taylor shop... ...but yesterday everything fell through. They said that according to... ...the city developement plan, that location is reserved for TV sevice shop. -So what are you going to do now? -That's nothing, comrade Jakovljevic! -Do you know we've lived for 25 years in sheds and basements?... ...he got heart condition and I got rheumatic knees... ..then we took a mortgage for this house and now we are in debts up to here! -Danica! Our problems are under control! -One more thing... ...we took one worry off our backs but another one showed up... ...our daughter graduated 5 years ago. She's a stomatologist and now she can't find a job... ...people don't have two tooth in their heads but there's no job for a dentist! -Danica! ..as long as there are jobs for 100 000 politicians! -What are you talking about? -Do you think their kids are waiting in line for jobs? -They first secure them jobs and then they give birth to them! -I'm sorry, my friends are waiting for me! -Please stay, finish your coffee... -Another time, mr. Cvorovic. -No problem, come by whenever you can. -Good bye. -Are you crazy, you stupid woman? Can't you tell he's provoking us.. ..and gathering information? -What have I said that's untrue? -Shut up. -As if you know what's true! -I do. -There are people in this country whose job is to know the truth. -I thought the same story all over again, when manager came in and... ..said "Congratulations, we hired you.." -And I'm looking at him, I almost fainted.. ..and I ask him "I got the job?"... ..you know what, if I knew you'll cry this much, I wouldn't accept that job! Mom! -My baby doctor! -Don't tell him yet, first I wanna give him hard time for what happened before. -Daddy, is it your heart? -Ilija, what happened? -Nothing,I fell and I got some bruises -Where did you fall? -On the ground, where else? -Why are you looking at me like that? I'm fine, give me some schnapps! -What so funny? Is it because I fell? -Daddy I got the job. -You got the job? -Yep, I'm starting on monday, childrens hospital. -Ilija...-Ah, yes, here, take your friends out, treat them, take it! -And you said a lot of things in front of that man. OK, OK, cheers! -Ah the car keys too. -OK, here you are... ...but be careful, there's plenty of lunatics that don't stop on red. -Let's get rid of that Moskvitch, he's using so much gas... -As if there is a better car? -I'll be back in 3 days. -What car is better then Moskvitch? -Finally, something nice happened to me. -Hallo, can I speak to inspector Drazic? That is you, inspector? Ilija Cvorovic here. -I've seen my tenant 2 hours ago at Dorcol area, there were five of them... ...they were looking at some maps, it was an organized meeting. Excuse me? -I accidentally passed by and I saw them. -Please I told you to relax... ..don't worry about the thing, good bye. -He doesn't give a fuck that this villain lives in my house, "don't worry, don't worry..." -Take it easy, Ilija. -These villains are roaming around and he says not to worry?! -Listen you, I've lived honestly and I'll die as an honest man! -I don't want fingers pointed at me when it's found he undermined the country from this house! -Ilija...-I went to prison once because I trusted people, it wont happen twice! -Hallo, comrade, stay out of shady affairs... you don't know who you're dealing with! -He's trying to involve innocent people in terrorism! -What's that? -Huh?? -What is that pin doing there? -Erm, I had to patch it up. -His actions are planned from here... -When did you start taking insuline? -2 years ago when he started using heroine... ...now we're both junkies. -Eh, my Petar, you have such bad luck... -It's not bad luck, I'm an idiot.

I've decided to build a house. Now I have to deal with builders, architects... ...but I'm born as a masochist, I'll hang on... -I've never visited Paris. -Here if you really wanna go, I'll give you... ..keys of my 2 bedroom appartment in the most beautiful part of Paris... -You kept that appartment just in case? -Ah, no, I wont go back to Paris.. ...I kept it for my son, but for him Paris wasn't enough, he left for New York -Finally,we had a big fight.

Is it? -Is this yours? -Have you heard him, is it yours??? -No, it's Polish. -Djura, stop it! He's provoking us, he wants us to kill him just so he doesn't confess... -Wait a minute...Listen... Do you know who, after 600 years, brought to the throne a foreign pope ? And a Polish one! -By accident, huh? And Leh Valensa got the Nobel prize for peace by accident? -Is it by accident you didn't write to your aunt for 20 years? -And by accident, you gave your appartment keys to my daughter and encouraged her to emigrate? -You're out of your mind, you're a lunatic. -Djura, stop it, you'll kill him Djura! -Djura stop it...Djura, STOP IT!!! -Go get the professor and doctor to confront them! -I'm not going anywhere, he'll attack you! -Look! -OK, that's better, if he tries something... ...fill him with lead!!! -OK, well done... -I apologise,but this is all your fault! ...you're constantly provoking us, humiliating us, insulting us... ...and Djura is a nervous type... let's have a cup of coffee... ...you surely know, you've got that from your bosses before you moved in... ...that I was in jail for 2 years... ...I don't know if they mentioned Djura, probably they have... ...he was in jail too, for 4 years... ...you see, they informed you right and I admit it... ...whenever someone asks me, I say "Yes,... ...I adored him! Stalin was for my idol, everything in the world.." ...today they say he did a lot of bad things, some if it true, some of it not.. ...they accuse him for crimes he didn't commit. some of it is true and I admit it... ...but back than, I thought he's pure like Virgin Mary... ...I was a young fool, I'd take a gun and fight,thinking that I fight for justice... ...I needed sobbering up... ...to stop and think about and to say to myself "The one who put you in jail wanted good for you"... ..and I'm very grateful for that today... ...today I know exactly where I made a mistake... -Are you in pain? Well, Djura knows where to hit... I'm telling you this because I think you're in a simmilar position like I was long ago... ...but my friend, you're not that young as I was back than... ...you're old enough to know better, pull yourself together... ...confess it and I swear... ...whatever you tell me, will remain within these 4 walls... Wait! I turned on the tape recorder, here, I turned it off. -I know you had to take your father's and brother's side when you were young. ...and you tuned to the wrong side, where foreign agents just waited for you... ...they are creating chaos in our country, stirred up by English and Americans -Americans waited for you in Paris and took you under their wing, right? -And you were young, you wanted to eat, to fuck and those things cost money... ...also drugs...-Mr. Cvorovic, I'll miss my plane. -Don't worry, you won't. -You won't miss the plane if we reach a compromise. -About what? -To confess all of this to me... ..I'm telling you this as if you're my brother Djura, confess it... ...we'll sit in my car, I'll take you to police and you'll say " I did it... "I'm guilty, I ate shit", exactly like I say it now, no begging... .."I ate shit, I did this and that, I was blind.." ..."Punish me, I want to pay for my sins and be a man again..." -Why are you grinning? -I can't believe there's a man like you. -Can I ask you something nicely? -Please do. -Help me not to kill you, do you understand me? -With lots of reasons, and to answer to no one... ...I was always on the verge to kill someone, don't let it be you, I beg you!!! -I don't want you to pay for all the others who humiliated me... ...who tortured me, please don't let you be the one. -And you will confess everything to the police and they will think about it... ...than we'll come back here, Danica will make lunch, we'll invite Djura, too... ...he'll forgive you for beating you... ...and you go back to Paris to work, but on our side... -And me - if they remember to give a public citation - good. If not, that's OK too. -It was my civic duty. -My greatest pleasure will be to know that I brought one man to the right path... -Can I ask you something as a friend? -Go ahead... -Let's go to the City hospital. -What for? -Do I look like I'm not well? -Yes... -I got tired, I'm chasing you all over Belgrade... My heart is failing. -Your nerves.. -My nerves? -Yes, they are failing. -Jakovljevic, you're nuts! I should go to hospital where your people are waiting for me? -Your doctors, who would lock me up... ...like a madman. You think I'm crazy? -Take me to the police, I don't want to talk to you any more. -Wait a minute! -We have to clear this up. -Jakovljevic, do you think I'm crazy? -You're certainly a very sick man. -What kind of illness do you think it is, Jakovljevic? -I can't see myself objectively and it's not nice to be crazy, Jakovljevic... ...and not to be aware of that. -I lived as a normal person for 60 years and suddenly I went crazy when I met you? -You're not so special to make a man crazy! -You imagine too much, as if you are very significant... -Jakovljevic, I'm not crazy, Jakovljevic! -I'm perfectly normal, not crazy, Jakovljevic. -Than it's terrible. -What's so terrible? -Not being crazy and yet behaving like this... ...it's worse than being crazy. -What is it than, Jakovljevic? -What? Won't you tell me what it is? -Jakovljevic, that's hate and disgust.. -You wounded me in WW2, I hardly stayed alive. -Who's "we'? -Who's we?! You, your father, your brother... ...and all those who we killed and those who got away with it... -When you saw that you can't kill me in a war, than you sent me to jail... ...you didn't like the idea that we're all equal... ..and that there are no class differences between people... -The war was hardly over and you're back already... ...with your honestly earned capital, a thousand such before you and even more coming... ..who will try again to build castles and mansions... ...to opress and destroy others again... ..is that so? Was I imprisoned... ...just because they made me believe in the system... ...and you're free because you don't believe in the system? -Oh you, motherfuckers, what does that mean? -Does it mean I was a fool my whole life? That I worked against my own principles, always on the wrong side... Is that it? Was I imprisoned just because I shouted "Long live Stalin and World revolution"? -Is that why you imprisoned me? What was I suppose to shout "Long live capitalism"? -Listen to me, Stalin killed you... ..but not enough, obviously, I kept his.. ...photo as icon on the wall and I'll do it again!!! -You wont win this battle as long as I live! -Me, my brother and thousands of our men!!! -Who are you? -You're not Jakovljevic! -You are someone else, even bigger traitor! Who are you? -Who are you? Who are you?!! -Comrade Cvorovic, you need your medicine! -Nitroglycerine... -This won't do, you need nitrglycerine!! -I don't have any... ...I couldn't find it in the pharmacies. -Halo, emergency? Please, an ambulance... ..to Serdar Jole street 14. Yes it is urgent! -Man is having a massive heart attack... ...Please, hurry... -Ambulance car will be here in ..I can't, your brother would kill me. Mr Cvorovic... ..I wish you the best of luck. -Halo, Smiljka? -Tell Djura to go and block the airport... ..the tenant slipped away... ...I'll follow him... -Get him! -Get him!
