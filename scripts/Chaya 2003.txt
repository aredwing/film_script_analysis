Why are you saying that for? You two, get the dirt out. What are you guys gabbling about? Hurry up! What the hell is this? Look. You two help open the lid. Hurry up! Why don't you give us a hand too? You should have help us. It's heavy. That's it for today. So damn heavy. Noi! Hello. Don't you come in. Nut, help me, please. Nut. Excuse me? Who is it? It's me. Ruj, how did you get here? Nut. There she goes again. Give me a hand. Get her on the couch. I'll get some water. Ruj, it's me. Nut, this... My sister. Your sister? Since when? Since 3 years ago. My uncle and his wife... which were her parents died in an accident. My dad adopted her. It was when you were abroad. Aren't you taking her to the hospital? No, I don't have to. She'll recover soon. I have no idea what the heck this is. No doctors know how to cure it. Hey, Sa. Nut. She's recovered. Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. Hello, uncle Hey, Sarut. When did you return? Oh, wow, you've been quite famous. In Cambodian's antiquities, Dr. Sarut is known to be number 1. Maybe it's just because I'm interested in it. Hat's why I pay much attention to it. Nut. Yes? I have some new thing to show you. Follow me to my office. Excuse us. Make yourself at home. Yes. Sa, take care of our guest for me. Slowly put it down. Good. Open the lid. Where did you get it, dad? Our men in the east sent it to me. I had a check. It's not faked. It looks like a coffin. Yes, but I can't be so sure... ...that's why I want you to go and take a look for yourself. And I'd like you to dig around for other remaining, oh yes, and why is your friend here? He just came back from abroad. So he stopped by for a little chat. What does he know about our job? How can we let anyone know about this? I'd like your friend to do the dig, if possible. This man's so straight forward. Just tell him that we're digging for the Department of Fine Arts. But... Just do as I tell you to. Remember, only concentrate on what you're doing. Yes. You're interested in Cambodian ancient culture too? Yes. I've always found it interesting. Would it be okay to ask for a signature? I'd like to keep it as a souvenir. So did you agree with what I wrote? From your story, it seems Princess Miyawantra has such a cruel heart. You meant when she poisoned her own father? Yes, even though she was about to be crowned, why assassinate? That was only from the encryption. The real story that happened nobody could knew the real reason. Except... those who were born in that era. If it's like that... everything would be solved then. What do you think? Why don't you let the government take care of this? If we let them do it. It'll take ages. And besides, I found that piece of antique. Imagine my name on the papers. And then we can have an exhibition at the gallery, it'd be a big hit. Then after that we can give it to the Department of Fine Arts. You too will be famous. Okay. I will do it. Stop trying to talk me into it. What? Nothing. That castle? Yam? Where's that grave? You have to go over there. Just keep driving and you'll see. You're not coming? No, you two should rather go alone. With too few people, I won't go in there. Where are you going? So fast. Let's go. Hey, Ruj, what's the matter? Ruj! It felt like someone just slit my throat. Are you okay? I'm fine. Let's get going. Take it easy. We can come again tomorrow. It's getting dark. And we better get more men. I think we should head back to our camp. The grave won't go anywhere. Thanks. It's hot. I asked Yam to find 10 men to help us tomorrow. More digging around the grave. But whose grave is it anyway? From the design of the coffin and how it was adorn with ornaments, it was probably as important as a ruler. And it was a she. But the way she was buried, was a punishment, because there were no assets in it. And the way the grave was built. There was no honoring. And from the location this area should be the land of Yasopura Nakorn which is in the same era as Princess Miyawantra. I think this is Her Highness corpse. That princess you've always been crazed about? Why aren't you so thrilled? I'm not so sure yet, but it is possible. But to make sure we have to check the age in Bangkok. This is not a small thing. No body had ever found any evidence at all. I think we need to let some professionals at the Department of Fine Arts to take a look at this. Department of Arts? Miyawantra Don't worry, sir. I'll bring the real one back to you this week. Sure, sir. Absolutely. Goodbye. Dad? Where are you now? Almost there. The roads are just killing me. How's everything over there? Good. We're brushing up the grave... and searching for other things. Great. I think I'll get there soon. That'll be all. Okay? Did you find anything else apart from the grave? Not yet. I don't hope much though. Since she was buried alive, I don't think there's any treasure in it. I'm so excited. I finally get to see Princess Miyawantra. I know you're really interested in her. That's why I brought you with me. Just don't make any troubles. Okay. What's the matter with you? I saw it. You saw what? A woman dressing strangely just cut in front of our car. Are you out of your mind? Who'd be walking in the woods like this? You're wasting time. Go. Go. Will you stare until I melt in front of you? In front of all the holy sacred. Let them be as my heart that placed at your feet forever. Let your sweetness be as lasting as your words. I fear that it will not be the same after the wedding ceremony. Nothing will part my loyalty for you even death. What are you dreaming of? Sa. Nut. What are you doing here? I've always been interested in Princess Miyawantra for ages. You know that. You can wait in Bangkok. You'll get to see her anyway. But... What's bugging you? It's not that trouble anyway. Hello, uncle. Hi. Where's Nut? Over there. We've found nothing so far except the coffin and a couple of potteries. Uncle, I think it's a little odd here. What's odd? I'm pretty sure that this is the grave of Princess Miyawantra. For the punishment, all assets including accessories are still here except the coffin's lid. So it's a little weird because even worthy things like this ankle bracelet is still here, Yam? I know nothing, sir. Know what nothing? I just want to ask you if this is the way it was when you've found it. Yes sir. It was like this. Are you so sure... that this is the body of Princess Miyawantra? I am, sir. Something told me so. I have something to discuss with you. Let's go talk inside the tent. Let me talk to Nut for a minute. Come, Yam. Where is the grave? Over there. I'll show you. Follow me. Yes. I told our men to brush around the graves. In case there are still thing that was left behind. Pawitra Akanirut No, Akanirut! Are you okay? How are you doing, Sa? I'm okay now. It's better. I was so worried. How come this time is worse? See? I told you to stay home but you didn't listen. You're asking for troubles. I'm sorry. You said 'Akanirut' before you passed out. Yes? Where did you get that name from? I'm not so sure. It was from the vision I saw before I passed out. Vision? Yes, and it passed away really fast I could hardly see. But the clearest one was a man dressed up like an ancient Cambodian warrior and slit his own throat to death. I knew straight away that he was Anakirut. And he looked a lot like Rut. You don't believe it, right? I do. I'm surprised because I've seen that Anakirut guy too. Come on, let's do it. Be careful. Be extra careful. Give it a push. Look out! Watch out! Put in your effort. It's up. Let's move it. Dad, Sa passed out. Is there anything I can do for you, Amitradevi? Who would dare to ask the king's son in law? I am not married yet, please do not call me by that name. Everyone in Yasopura knew of that. But, I will not pulling your leg. I invited you here today... to give you a drink blessings you and my beloved sister, Miyawantra. After the drink has passed through your throat, let anything I do be forgiven. If that's all. I'll have to say goodbye. I guess General Akanirut is drunk now. Akanirut. Are you alright? You were crying out loud. I had a bad dream. It's good that you are okay. I'm thinking of sending you back to Bangkok. Everything seems to be in a mess here. It's not fun anymore. Boss! What shall we do with those men? It was just an accident. Why are they scared? Let's have a look. Take care of her. What happened? The workers got scared that what had happened... would be because of the spirit guarding the grave. Do you believe that? Spirit? Yes. Who is it? Who is it? Miyawantra, what relationships are we in? You want to know what we are Akanirut? You were the commander in chief of King Visudhdevaya of Yasopura Father of me, Miyawantra and my sister, Pawitra. Should nothing happened... you would be the next king as my consort. But no one knew of everything... and with the love for my sister... I sacrificed half of my heart to her. But that would never satisfy her need. Her most malicious mind wanted all. She wanted to take everything from me. Even her own father's life... was used to get rid of me. Wantra Father, it is time for medicine. My daughter, you are not angry that I have postponed your wedding ceremony? I do understand your reason. To have resentment among sisters because of a man is not a right thing to do in royal family. Pawitra's behavior is not right, and we all know that. But I only ask you to forgive someone with your blood. I do understand that. If I can't let go of a thing such as this, How can I reign? And Pawitra is also my beloved sister too. You... Father. Help, is there anybody out there? The King has been poisoned. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. No! I've never thought you could be this cruel, Because he had postponed your wedding. Do you really want the throne this bad? No... I Forgive me, soldiers, take her to prison. No! Pawitra, you've misunderstood. No! Pawitra, No! For you. Forgive me, but I have to follow the law. Have you got any last words to say? Remember my word, Pawitra. I have not planned of any harm against father. You must find the real criminal... to prove my innocence. The Cobra snake poison that I used has got no color nor scent, The only people who would know about this would be you and me. It'd be rather impossible to catch any criminal. Pawitra! You! I curse you. I will revenge your soul every life. Your soul? It'll be locked up here with your body. Forever. Pawitra. Pawitra. Pawitra. Let go of me. Pawitra. Pawitra. After that you know what happened. I knew of your loyalty and love for me From your voice above. Miyawantra Including the blood that seeped through the ground. No, Akanirut I have lost count of how many lives I've been waiting for you. I won't let anyone get in our way now. Come, my beloved one. Now that cruel Pawitra's life is almost over, let her death be a blessing for our love. Sa! What happened to her? Why? Akanirut? Why do you still have feelings for her? I'm not Akanirut. Even though I know I was once. But now I'm Sarut Anirutteva. Not your Akanirut, your lover. How could you forget our love so fast? Or have you forgotten that once all you wished for was to give your heart as a bracelet that would stay by my feet forever. Or is it because of the lust that one made you forgot everything? Miyawantra. What had happened in the last life I have no idea. Neither does Wisa, My religion had taught me that everyone was born to pay off their Karma. If Wisa or Pawitra had committed so much bad karma she is probably paying it right now. No, no way. There is no words from any cults or religion to heal away the pain of revenge in my heart. It will only be healed by blood. She won't die that easy. She'll have to suffer as much as I had to suffocate before I die. Who ever tries to get in my way won't be forgiven. I'll take the coffin out again tomorrow. And make the ground steeper. Plus adding in 4 more ropes. Yam, tell our men to be more careful and don't stand in the back. I'll tell them to be more careful sir. What? Sa's been hit by a car. She's in coma. What should we do, dad? Why is it with everything? Then let's go back to Bangkok. Yam, take care of here for me. Yes, sir. There's nothing much overall. What I'm worried is she hasn't recover yet. I'm afraid we'll have to check her nervous system again. Oh, Sa. Yes, I'm so sorry. There was an accident that slowed us down. Oh yes, I'll send you the lid first. Yes. So hard to get the money. Dad. Dad. The door wasn't locked. Rut, go check upstairs, I'll check the store room. Dad! What's going on? Yes, please contact back. Thank you. Cool down, Nut. When police arrives, they will find some clue. Now what's missing? Just Miyawantra's coffin lid? What? Hello? Yes. Sa's missing? What do you mean about Miyawantra's coffin lid? Could we talk about that later? I think you should be concerned about where Sa is and how she's gone. I think I know where she is. You get this thing done, leave Sa to me. Miyawantra, please stop all this revenge. Sa. Sa. Sa. Sa. Are you okay? What is this all about? Rut? Be careful! Shit! Come this way. Be careful. This way. Watch out. Man's word cannot be trusted. Akanirut Is this Akanirut, the man I've been loving and waiting for years after years? The man who promised to place his heart at my feet. He has forgotten so fast. How many lives had I been crying out to Sivadev just to see you once again. Is this the love you gave me by trusting a betrayer such as Pawitra? Anyway, tonight will be the night I'll get it over with all the love and revenge. Let it be the end. Wisa, Be careful. Does she really mean that much to you, Akanirut? Miyawantra, I beg you. Let go of this girl. Rut. Sa, don't. You won't have a chance to help the man you love Pawitra. You too will suffocate like I did. The pain of losing the one you love right in front of you. Then I'll let you die, slowly, painfully. Miyawantra, I beg you. Let her go. You want me to let go, Akanirut? Do you know how much it hurt to be in that small coffin, how it slowly took my last breath. Do you know how long it took? All I have in my mind is... revenge. Just pure revenge, Akanirut. But that's what happened in the past. This girl is not Pawitra, look at her. She is not. I beg you, Wantra. Human being are born to fix what they done wrong. Akanirut sacrificed his life that day was to prove the love for you. His love and his sacrifice still live, Wantra. Don't be so sad, Wantra. Your mother had left you a sister to take care of. Do this well. I'm so sorry. You are not that betrayer. And you are not my beloved warrior. Your lives are nothing for me. My enemy had passed away by the circle of life. Thank you, Wantra. Let two of you forever be in love. Please forgive the things I've done to you in the past. We can't fix the past. Presence is what we can change. Yes. Rut, we're ready. Should we load this on board? Who are you selling it to now? No, no. I promise you. This will go straight to Department of Fine Arts I will not dare to touch our land's treasury. Oh, I almost forgot, Yam just returned this. He confessed at my father's funeral. Must have been afraid to die. It said to put here. Can I have it? No one knew it exists right from the start, let's just make it lost.
