I'm all over the gaff, man. No, no, no. Listen, I've not been home. Yeah? I feel like shit. I smell like shit. Listen, I swear to you now, yeah? No, I'm pro... You know, it's just like... You know, she was a nice girl... ...but it's just not my scene, man. I've got other things on me nut. No, we got stoned. We got the munchies. We went to the garage. Nothing happened, okay? I've got to concentrate on this job. I can hardly keep my eyes open. You're late. Oh, hi, are you? Nothing, nothing, nothing. It's just a job. I'll call you later. Alice, the invite for tonight. Thanks. Hi. I was just... It's all up and working. You've got the four alarm settings. All the cameras are wireless, all right? You can monitor any room remotely from any PC anywhere, okay? When you're at home, you just use this remote. - I'm sorry it took so long. - That's okay. - It's gonna cost a bit. - Yeah, I know. Should I take you through the system? Actually, I have to go out. You can give me a thumbnail sketch before I go. I'm gonna take a shower. Why don't you put your stuff away and pour yourself a proper drink? Everything working? Beautiful. So I have to go to this stupid party. It's for work. What if you came with me? How's this? I can't wear that. I'm just the alarm guy. You'd be doing me a favor. Grew up not far from here. Haven't been back for a while. So it's the next one. It's a left here. It's here, here, here. Are you sure about this? I need to piss. - Are you watching me? - No. You see that? I didn't see a thing. Mind if I drive? Good evening, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Fucking hell. What's the occasion? It's my boss' housewarming. Cashed in his shares and bought this. Thank you. Will I be bored? You won't be bored. Alice, you look fabulous. Misha's right over there. Alice, over here. You look amazing. Hello, Misha. Who's this? - Adam. - Hi, Adam. What do you do? I install wireless security systems, custom built. How old are you, Adam? I'm 23. Sorry. Welcome. Nice guy. Why don't you get us something to drink? I'll catch up after I chat with a few people. Go on. How did you meet him? He's installing the alarm system in my flat. Well, really? And how long has this affaire de coeur been progressing? Oh, about three hours. Maybe I'll get myself a young little thing. It's all for you, of course. If you wanted it. Hi. It's so fucking quiet in there. Hurry up, yeah. Fucking hell. Come on, you had fun, yeah? I think... ...I might be having the best night of me life. Oh, God. Why is he going so slowly? Come on. Burn him up, you've got the machinery. You wanker! So are you gonna dump me at the edge of town... ...and never see me again? Is that what you'd like? Well? I'll let you know. Will you now? Fucking hell. You okay? - We should do something. - No, it's too late. We can't just leave it here. Let's get it off the road. Go and sit in the car. Shit. Adam, get in the car. Two secs. This is silly. We need help. Adam, get in. Jesus. No, stop it. What are you doing?! Adam! Leave him alone! - Shit! - No! Stop it! Stop it! Jesus! Shit. Oh, my God. Fuck. Fuck. Oh, fucking... - Need a push? - What the fuck do you want?! What the fuck do we want? Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, I didn't... Shut up! Shut up! Stop that! Stop it! Get inside. Lady, open the door. - Come here. - No. That's better. That's much better. She's all yours, sir. No, no. Take it easy, darling. What did they do? Don't tell anyone. - What? - I have to tell you something. What? What? I can't see, what? - What? - All right, Adam. No! No! It's not helping. Just one. We said, didn't we? Fuck it. Adam, wait. Turn around. What? What did you wanna tell me? Today's my first day back at work. Yeah. Are you sure? It's been a month. It's enough, yeah? Your eye stuff's on the table. Come on. Police aren't interested. Just another case of GBH. A fucking farce. Came to the house. Useless. Yeah. You came back. Hi, Alice. It's nice to see you. I was trying to reach you. Your father's solicitors called Monday. Said it was urgent. Welcome back. Mr. Collins, Alice Comfort. Go ahead. How long ago? When was the funeral? I see. No. We weren't really in touch anymore. Yeah, I know where it is, thanks. Oh, Dad. Oh, shit. I'm sorry, sorry. Sorry. You fucking dozy tart. Sorry. - Sorry, my car runs away with me. - Well, no worries. The man with the beard, who is he? Heffer. - Heffer? - That's what we call him, okay? Alice. Alice. Where the fuck are you? Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Two days. Two fucking days, you selfish... I went to your work. They said you was ill. They didn't know where you were. Well, what was I supposed to think? Fuck, I'm so sorry. I'm making some food. Are you sure it was him? His name's Heffer. Heffer? Okay. I followed him to his house. Where? About six miles down the road. Two and a half if you go through the woods. Will you put that fucking stuff away? - What? - You're so soft. Fuck off. What's got into you? What can we do? Call the police? We did call them. We didn't tell them the whole story. You didn't tell them about... No. It won't do any good. I wanna show you something. - Where did that come from? - It's my father's. He was a soldier. He didn't believe in turning the other cheek. Was he in the army long, your old man? - All his life. - Yeah. Tough guy. Left his gun for his daughter to have. Taught her how to use it. So... ...we run around the countryside shooting people, is that...? Do you know what they did after they finished with me? They laughed. I can't just walk away. I wish I could. That fucking animal. Keep still. What do you want me to do, Adam? It's your call. Well? Do it. All right, bag him. Come here, come here. Come on. Alice, there's stuff everywhere... Adam, stop it. Look, we had no choice, right? It would have barked every time we got near. I know, I know. Look, had to be done, yeah? Yeah. You'll get used to it. Crisis! Shit. Crisis? Alice. Alice. Crisis! Shut up. You filthy fuck. Think about it, Alice. Think. Crisis! Come on, Crisis, where are you? Crisis! Crisis! Who the fuck's that? Soph. Sophie. I'm gonna look for him. That's his daughter. How do you know? I just know. Crisis! It's okay. Fucking... It's okay. Crisis! Crisis! Crisis. You look like you know your way around. You haven't seen a dog, have you? I lost my dog. I've been looking all day and I can't find him. I'm sorry. Everything's so shit without him. My life's shit. It's all just so fucked up. Maybe it's time to leave. And go where? I just wanna find my dog. He just wouldn't run away and leave me. Where did you go? For a walk. Here. I've been thinking. They'll come here eventually. We just have to keep on watching. We don't know that they'll come. We'll have to sit there for days. Well, the dog's out of the way. They fucking raped me, Adam. And they fucking destroyed your face. Look, we need to be able to see inside the house. We need to see when they come. All your equipment is in your van. - Just have to get you in the house. - Inside the house, yeah. Yeah. You're fucking crazy. Okay. Well, then why don't you fuck off... ...and leave me be? Alice. Napisy pobrane z NapisZone I just... We did the dog, yeah? So why can't we just? I don't understand what the fuck we're doing here. Come on, come on, come on. Fuck. Fuck. We were in the mood for some entertainment. I told you, I was looking for my dog. - Your dog? - Never mind. - It's not your old dog we came to see. - Fuck off. It's the young pup. - Call her, Billy. - Sophie. - We've come to see you. - She's not here. Tell us where she is, old chap. We'll go and pick her up. Shit. Well, you are a bit of cunt. Yes, fair enough, Mr. Rape-o. - Jamie, please. - You sick fucks. I see you've turned the missus to face the wall. God rest her. - Must be ashamed of something. - Something disgusting. Sophie must have done that. Doesn't want her dead mom to see what a mess you've made. She'd die all over again. Jamie, really, what do you want? We may find that we need some more money. I haven't got any more money. All right, well, since you're an old friend... ...tomorrow morning. Or I'll be forced to collect. - Maybe you can take the Porsche? - That fucking crap piece of shit?! Fuck. Fuck. Sophie? Where are you, hon? Okay. Trust me. Trust me, okay? Are you in there? - Sophie? - They did this to me... ...your father and his friends. Where are you? Billy boy. Give it to her. Sophie? Sophie? Please! - Sophie. - They've gone. You okay? I could hear them talking. Just hold on a minute. Fucking hell. Fuck it. Take this off. Quickly. I fucking love you. I fucking love you. I want you to turn over for me. Turn around. Turn over. - That's it, good girl. - Adam. - Listen to me. - Adam, no. Now, listen. I just want you to tell me something. - I need you to tell me. - No! - Are you ready for a fuck? Tell me. - No! Fucking tell me. Want a very good fuck? No! Fuck off. What the fuck are you doing? Stop it. What are you doing? No. No. Adam! Adam. Adam. Adam! You fucking... You can't do this! You fucking coward. I'm cold. Let's get you in the house. Fucking help me. Come on, stand up. Help me. Where did you come from? You fell against the car horn. I heard it from the road. The road's two miles away. I want... I want to thank you. I was making a mistake. Another mistake. Well, we all make mistakes. I've done something. Go on. I knew some people... ...who were friends of mine. I owe them money. And we used to work together long time ago in the military. After Maggie died, I began to see them a lot. Who's Maggie? My wife. Anyway, I was driving them home, these friends of mine. We'd been drinking. Must have been 4 in the morning. And there she was. My daughter. Miles from anywhere. Sophie, need a lift home? Leave her. I'll pick her up later. We'll take her. Yes, Bill? I'd love to take her. Crisis. I try to make sure Sophie isn't around these two men. Just because the way they look at her. They're cold, cold men. Anyway, she... Jamie starts telling her things about me. Toying with her. We've been to a party. And your papa's invited us all back to yours. I think we should just put him to bed. Leave her out, please. She's 16, for fuck's sake. - In Djibouti... - It's too late. ...I saw Jamie shoot a taxi driver in the back of the head... ...instead of paying the fare. - Fuck off. - What do they want? Don't speed up. Let them wait. You wanker. Fuck. Well, that wasn't very nice, was it? I think we all need a pick-me-up. Not in front of my daughter, Jamie. Now you, beautiful. I think then she knew what was gonna happen. She was trusting me... ...to do something. I had to do something before we got home. So, what did you do? I improvised. It was a diversion. That was all it was ever meant to be. Just something to get Jamie and Bill's mind off my little girl. - Get out. - What you doing? You're hurting him. Shut up, just go. Go now. I'll keep them busy. I made myself want to do it. I made myself. And then I didn't wanna stop. What did you do? Say it. I fucked her. Take it easy, darling. Catch. No! That's it, that's it. Alice. Alice. Fucking little tart. Yeah. You fucking remember me. Shut your fucking mouth. Shut it. Quiet! Shut up. Gag him. Get him up here. Up, up. - Where are we going with this? - Just hold him tight. Stay still. You filthy fuck. Fucking give it to him. You ready? You fuck. Fuck's sakes, Alice, give it to him. It's over. - I thought you was gonna shoot him? - I was. Then fucking do it. That's why we came. - It's over, Adam. - No. No, it's not over, no. I haven't fucking forgiven. Now, come here, show me. That's it. Now, what's your best eye? - Yeah, yeah. - Adam, don't. No. - Come on, just step away. - Shut up! Shut up! You've had your fucking go. An eye for an eye. Justice for me, Alice, yeah? - Yeah? Yeah? - Adam... ...I am begging you. Put the knife down! You brought me here. This was your fucking idea. No! Fuck! Fuck! Alice. Alice. Alice. Where are we going? Somewhere safe. It's your friends. What's up, Jamie? Looks like there's someone else in there. Fucking Christ! Fuck. Fuck.
