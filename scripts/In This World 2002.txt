The most recent came to escape the US-led bombing campaign... which began on October 7th, 2001. Many of these children were born here, like Jamal. He is an orphan. He works in a brick factory. He gets paid less than a dollar a day. It is estimated that 7.9 billion dollars... were spent on bombing Afghanistan in 2001. Spending on refugees is far less generous. The daily food ration is 25 grams of vegetable oil and 60 grams of pulses. Every family is given a tent, a plastic sheet... three blankets and one stove. Who's moved my clothes? I'm going, okay. - Ask your uncle to help you. - Okay. Be careful. Think carefully and don't... Don't worry. I'll tell him. Wait for me! Share the bread. Eat like a human, slowly.

More than five million live in Asia. Almost one million of these live in Peshawar. Many of them want to leave.
