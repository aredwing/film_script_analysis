Uh, no. But I've got some fancy pants perfume for you. - Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Okay, what about this one, Julien? Roses are red. Violets are green. You are so handsome, you make all the ladies scream. It's no use, Maurice, I am a king without a kingdom. Where is all the admiration? The fawning? The brown nosing?

Do you see what is happening here? Make them stop. Make them stop. It is a message from the gods. They are looking down from the heavens and saying, "King Julien." And I say, "Ugh, what do you want now?" And they say, "Sorry to disturb you, all great and most dashing king with all the best dance moves." And I say, "Oh, do you mean like this?" "Yes! We love that!" "So, get on with it. What do you want already?" "Even though you're all these great things, you deserve more." "Oh, go on." "King Julien, take this potion and from this moment forth you will be known as the King of Love." Ah! King of Love? Come, Maurice. We have much work to do. Wake up, Africa. it's Valentine's Day!

Whoa, sounds like a blast. But we've got a rendezvous at the human safari camp. Where's a monkey when you need one? Ugh. Fellas, if I ever let some doll get to me like that, just put me down. What? What did I do? Target identified, sir. All clear. Skipper. This silent treatment is killing me. Just tell me what's bothering you. I can't get into this right now, dollface. Keep lookout. We'll be back in a jiff. Whoo. Today must be my lucky day. I tell you, fellas, it's like I'm talking to a piece of wood. How am I supposed to know what she's thinking? - I mean, I'm not a mind reader. What is going on in here? Penguins? You can only get so far when the conversation's all one-sided. Rico? Fire! Stop, drop and roll! One minute everything's peachy and the next, sneak attack. Flanks me with the cold shoulder. Skipper, with all due respect... You and your lady friend need to patch things up. Pronto! You're right, I deserve that. Um, Skipper, there's something you need to see up here. - Whoa. - This better be important, Private. Shiitake mushrooms. Penguins! Get them! - Hula Girl! - We'll deal with this later! Dollface! - Rose petals? - Check. - Water? - Check. Is it ready yet? There must be 50 zebras all up in her face right now. Come on, Marty. This things not going to make you irresistible. Trying to work here. Melman? Where did that giraffe go? Chop-chop, Kowalski. I need that potion now. A couple more love songs on that ukulele and I'll be done for. All right, everybody out. Out, out, out! Final ingredient. Hexyl cinnamaldehyde. Hexyl cinna what? I don't know! Just improvise.

What the... - He's right, freak. The joke will be on you when my magic potion works its magic. And the water buffalo said, "That's not my mama." I'll admit it. I like romantic comedies. - Hey, where's she going? - What? - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - We were talking. - What she doing? - Hello! Hi, there. She spoke to me. - Did I say that out loud? I don't know what it is about you, but there's something that I just find irresistible. Wow. Check it out, it's actually working. How can it be permissible She compromise my principle Yeah, yeah Oh! She a craze you endorse she's a powerful force You're obliged to conform when there's no other course Ah! But now I find her Whoo! Higher, higher! Yeah! Whoo! Call me. Simply irresistible Hey, Alex, welcome to the love shack. Ho-ho. Wow. Yeah, this is really something. Oh, you've gotta read some of these Valentines. I didn't think they could find a word to rhyme with magnificent. But they did! - Ha-ha! Yeah, you know, speaking of Valentines, I realized I still hadn't given you yours. So... Great! Throw it on the pile. Oh! How could I have missed the pile? Okay, I'll just be on my way then. Unless you have something... That's the stuff! ...for me? Mmm. Smells like jojoba. Oh, did you say something out loud? Alex? Any requests, Marty? Free Bird? At least I never needed a magic love potion to get my Valentines. They came naturally. I don't know, Julien. This doesn't look like the one the penguins made. Don't worry, hippo woman. I threw in a few new ingredients to kick it up a notch. That giraffe won't know what hit him. - Nice try, Julien. - Hey! - Alex! - Seriously, Gloria, come on. Not you, too. But I think I might be losing Melman. You are! You're not losing Melman. You don't need this. Yes, you do! Oh, I don't know what to think any more! Gloria! Could this day get any worse? Ow! What was that? A wake-up call. Wake up? What are you talking about? You used to be a New York giant. Now, your hair's a mess and you're all alone. Yeah, well, it's your fault. Your stupid potion is making everybody crazy. Is it? Or are you crazy not to try it? Yeah, right. You can be irresistible. Just like you were back in New York. Close your eyes. Can you hear the crowd screaming your name? "We love you, freak." They're going crazy for you. Do you hear it? Yeah, I can hear them. - Freak, freak, freak, freak. - Freak. They can't control themselves. Freak! - Freak! Freak! - Freak! Don't you want that back again? I do. Sign here. Now, go get your mojo back. What is that smell? Ladies and gentlemen, Alex the Lion! - Ha-ha! - You reek! - Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna be sick. - Me, too! Get away from us! Hey. wait! - How long is this song? - Whoo-hoo! I think I need a little air. Hey, where's Marty? Where's Marty? Ah! That's more like it. What's more like it? All right. Why don't you take five, ladies? I need a little Marty time. Sounds great. - Come on, everybody. it's Marty time. You guys are funny. But seriously, I need a little space. A little more space, please. More space, more space! - Hey, look! There's Marty! - Where? Easy, easy. Perfect. Save yourself! Save my what? Oh. - Melman? - What? Melman! Melman, why don't you wanna spend time with me today? What? No, it's not you. It's... - it's me? You're dumping me? - I'm what? - On Valentine's Day? - No! You sick, sick giraffe! - Gloria! I don't wanna be irresistible any more! Come back, Marty! Wait, where's Marty? Um... What are we doing here? Who's Marty? Beats me. Oh, girl, I hope that's not permanent. No more love potion. Operation "Hula Rescue" is a go! Skipper, she's heavily guarded. Not for long. Listen up, pretty boy, I may not have your perfect tan or your chiseled abs but I've got something you'll never have, a wounded heart. Dollface, it took losing you to realize how much I need you in my life. Just let me talk. I used to think Valentine's Day was just a superficial holiday for sissies, wussies, and pansies. But now I realize that buying cheap flowers or some pre-packaged chocolate isn't just a whacked-out merchandising conspiracy, it's also just a nice thing to do. Huh! Not again! Skipper! Code red! Handle it! - Goodbye! Well, Hula Girl, I'm begging you. Will you take me back? Is that a yes? Or no? Ha-ha! Not my bobblehead! Stop it! Is it yes, you need more time? Or, or no, you're not ready to answer? Oh, come on, make up your mind! You are mine now! It's a yes! Aw! Well, no hard feelings, kid. Hope we can all stay friends. No! No! I don't get it. What happened today? Well, it's his loss. I'm over it! What in the world? Music? Dance number? Lady Liberty float? Oh, Melman. Come on, Julien. I need that potion. Mmm. I don't know. Skinny, sickly guy like yourself. What could you possibly do for me? I can reach tall places. Okay, deal. Don't you make that deal, Melman Menkowitz. - Oh, great. They're gonna make up. - Come on, Frankie. Okay, this is like the sweetest thing that anyone's ever tried to do for me. Yeah, until I ruined it. Baby, I didn't need all this. All I wanted to know was that you were thinking about me. Hmm. Oh, I was thinking about you. Aw! Yeah, well, here's someone none of us was thinking about. Aw. You know what? I think I know something that might cheer him up. "Roses are red, violets are blue, I love writing myself Valentines, but no one else seems to do it to me." It's too wordy. Huh? What the... Uh... We know it's not like it was back at the zoo, but... - We could make you some more. - No. You got it just right. It's not about how many cards you get, it's about who you get them from. Aw! Wow! No offense, but you stink! You need a bath! - In turpentine! Ladies and gentlemen, gather around! Oh, not again! The King of Love is back with a brand new bottle of... And the lucky freak who gets to try it first will be... - Ha-ha! - Ah! It's okay. It's okay. There's still some left. Now, who wants it? - Ew! That is disgusting! Oh, King Julien... Oh, that's a nightmare coming. Hey, you can't leave. You must sign the contract. Maurice, you're my lawyer. Do something! I would advise against any sudden movement right now, Julien. Where is the love?
