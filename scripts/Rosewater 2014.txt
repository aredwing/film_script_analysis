A mix of sweat, and the rosewater they showered down on the faithful. I used to think only the most pious carried that seem. Mazi jaan... Mazi jaan... Mmm. Wake up. These men want to talk with you. Get up, sir. And get dressed. We are here now. Hi. Hi. Would you like to come back tomorrow? It is a bit of a mess. It is my childhood room so... No? No. Take some. We don't want to impose. You come with the sunrise, you go through my son's belongings, and you say you don't want to impose? Put on your scarf, madam. Do I provoke you? Mother, mother... Uh... Why do you have so many films? Because I've always liked watching them. I've been watching them since I was a kid. What is this? This is porno? No. No, no. It is an Italian film. Uh, an art film. This is porno. No. Do you know about this? Sir, she doesn't know. It is an art film from Italy. What is this? Next time you see my face, show some respect. I will. You motherfucker! You shot my foot! The Sopranos. Porno. Sopranos. Porno. Leonard Cohen? Amazing! Right? It's beautiful, but ominous. Keep it. I got it for you. It's just some music. Jewish? Porno? Porno? Tintin. Porno? Yes. Could be. Yes. What... What does this say? I don't know. You don't know? No, it's in German. I don't know. But it's from your room and you don't know? Yeah, but it's my late father's. God bless him. Confiscate this. Please. You know if you can't reach me at the office, you can always call my sister. Yes. And you have her work number? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And if I can't reach you? Sorry. I'm going to miss you. We have to make the extra cash, no? I know. Yeah. With this guy coming in here. It's crazy how, like, you're one month pregnant and you're already like this. Go away. Hey. Ah, I felt it. Yeah? I think so. Yes. What do you want from us? Do you come in peace? It's just one week. There is great anticipation in the run-up to Iran's presidential election Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the hardline incumbent, is no longer the guaranteed victor. His opponent, the more moderate Mir-Hussein Mousavi, has been gaining quickly and could be poised for an historic upset. But Ahmadinejad's student organizer Alireza Abkar still believes. So-called Western democracy is corrupt because it reflects only the will of the people. Why the Iranian state is superior? Well, where do I begin? We have a big, huge backing of Ali Khamenei, and he supports Ahmadinejad's motives. He understands it's an Islamic state, not a corrupt, Westernized environment which Mousavi would like. Kids today. Right? I'd love for you to reconnect with him now that the elections are upon us. You think he'll still want to talk? Yes, I mean, if I bring him some Maltesers, he will talk. Allah is no match for London chocolates. It's not funny. I'm sorry? It's pathetic. Ahmadinejad or whoever, they take these poor street kids, who've got nothing, give them food or sweets or whatever. Indoctrinate them to spout this gibberish. It's pathetic, and that's the real story we should be doing. He's from here. Sorry? Alireza, he's from here. He's an Iranian Brit. He was born and raised here. He's educated. He doesn't need the chocolates. He just misses them. Well, off we go. Yeah. Let's go. Thanks, Bobby. Remember Lindsey Hilsum's out there if you need anything from Channel 4. Okay. Cool. All right. I was last in Iran three months ago for my sister's funeral. Her name was Maryam. She was my heart. I followed her to every film, museum and concert she would take me to. In 1980, she was arrested by the Ayatollah Khomeini. Six years in prison for being a communist. Six years! MARY AM'. Mali... Maryam was following the footsteps of my father. My father Baba Akbar had been jailed by the Shah for the same offense. Of course, he gave them nothing;. I gave them nothing. He never broke. I never broke. I miss them both. Please turn off the computers. Oh, yeah. Thank you very much. See you later. See you later. Ah! Ah! Welcome, sir. Hey, hey. Come, come. Let me take this from you. Come. Come. Thanks to God I came along, you could have been stuck here for hours, huh'? Hey, hey. No, no, no. He's a personal friend of mine. I've come to get him. Don't listen to him. A brand new car for you. Freshly painted, huh! You can relax. I'm from here. It's fine. Ah. Welcome home. Okay. I see you have a Mousavi poster. Yes, it helps. It doesn't let in the sunlight. What do you like about him? Uh, he isn't Ahmadinejad. He's getting a lot of attention now. Do you think it's only because of who he isn't? Uh, may I ask, are you here for, uh, business or pleasure? Or perhaps pleasure's bitter rival, family? No, I'm a journalist I'm covering the elections for Newsweek magazine. Oh, yeah? Yeah. And I'm also visiting my mother. Uh, I meant no disrespect. No problem. I think Mousavi is honest. Well, maybe he's not. Tell Newsweek, tell the whole world, if Mousavi fails us, it's okay, we will find someone who won't. I see you're in the satellite business. Sir, satellite dishes are illegal and I shouldn't have to remind you we live in a lawful and devout society. Do you need one? VPNs? Information access here is very fragile. No' I'm very happy with my satellite service. But I am in the market for a responsible driver. What kind of, uh, vacation benefits package are you offering with this position? Absolutely none. Okay. Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah? Yeah. Great. You sold it to me. Davood. Davood. Mazijoon! How are you, Moloojoon? Good, good. Did you sleep on the plane? Well, relatively. I'll make you baghali ghatogh for your lunch. You'll need to eat as much as you can before reporting on all this ashghal. Moloojoon, come on. You can't be this cynical. What? Mom, tomorrow is the election. Surely you'll be standing with the people. Don't tease me. Yeah. I had a very persuasive cabbie. He is very excited about this "not Ahmadinejad." Who knows, maybe this time it will be different, right? Garbage doesn't pick itself up. If the people don't, then who will? You sound like Maryam. And you sound like Babe. It's good to see you. Have you washed your hands? In the plane. Go wash it. Go wash your hands. Go, go, go. Go. You slept well, huh? Yep. Come. Would the kind gentleman like the window or the aisle seat? Oh, no. No. No. What is this'? Where is your cab? I don't have a cab. What did we ride in this morning? Oh, yeah, that. Oh, that was my friend's cab. He was sick. He said I could use it. I never said I had a cab. Okay. Are you sure? Yeah. This... Even if I had a cab, it's not the way to get around this city. Trust me, man. You can't get anywhere. Okay. Okay. With this... You get where you want to go, quick, you know. Yeah, yeah. All right. Yeah? Okay. You take it? Yeah, yeah. Hold this? I'm fine. Sure? Okay. Yeah. And you're gonna look good on this, huh. Okay! Oh, by the way, I brought you these good friends of yours from London. Chocolates! Mmm-hmm. You're very kind. No problem. No problem. Uh, Davood, turn that off, please. Okay, So tell me, there's recently been a lot of talk about Mousavi's strength. Is it something that surprises you? Is it something you expected? Mousavi is, uh, corrupt Like many of the founders, he has forgotten the lessons of the revolution. It is easy to fall off the path. But he has his supporters, right? Some academics, some dead-enders. Well, Mousavi says that Ahmadinejad is not his main concern in the election but the election itself. They think that the vote might be rigged. That there might be some manipulation... Who says this? Oh, people in the street. Journalists, clerics... Please, stop. This is all nonsense. Rumors and lies that enemies of Iran would like us to believe. To weaken us. I'm surprised, Mr. Bahari, that a sophisticated person would fall for this. What about an unsophisticated person? Hmm. Ahmadinejad is devoted to the Supreme Leader. You see, we are not a nation, Mr. Bahari, we are the Ummah, the Islamic nation. We obey the commands of the Supreme Leader, and the Supreme Leader determines all. Ahmadinejad understands this, Mousavi does not. Ahmadinejad is what must be. And are you going to watch the debate tonight? We'll have it on, but, uh, as I said, there is still much to be done. Good. "This is what must be, Maziar. "This is what must be." Oh, man, that guy! Who talks like that? I can't believe he let you film it. Why not? He's a poster boy for the Supreme Leader. What's he got to be afraid of? Looking like an ignorant asshole. He's not alone, you know. Yeah. Neither am I. Just because you can't see the cockroaches doesn't mean they are not there. Come on, Davood, let's go... Uh, uh... Patience, brother. Listen, you're a reporter' right? Don't you want to report the other side? I'll take you to it. Where are we going? Huh? Where are we going? To a dead end. Come. Hamid. Cyrus. Maziar. Cyrus. Maziar. Hey. Hi. So you are a reporter? Yes. You've come to the margins to find out what the animals think? We don't have lo use the camera if you don't want. No, no, no. You can film. Yes? Sure? Yeah. You don't have to tell me your names, okay? Hamid Javilli. Cyrus. And, uh, who are you guys gonna vote for? Mousavi. Why? Because we are a great people, a great civilization, and we deserve a president that's equal to our past. They say that Mousavi is gonna cut the relief funds. Do you think that's gonna happen? I don't care. You wanna talk to my brother? Ahmadinejad gives them money every month to smoke opium. Opium. We don't want their money. We want a life. We are {he educated. Only the uneducated are the ones who vote for the dictator. So you are students? Uh... We are the educated. Huh. Come. Come. Okay. Come on, we'll show you. Davood? Yeah. You're in frame every single time. My apologies for the conditions, Mr. Bahari. It's okay. Yes, Hamid. When is this shithole due for renovation, huh? Uh, when you get laid maybe. When I get laid? Ask your sister. Oh, you wish! Mr. Bahari, welcome to Dish University! The economy in Iran is on the verge of collapse! Novels are now censored by the Ministry of Islamic Guidance. .. nuclear weapon could unbalance the whole region. Mr. Bahari, you can film. You can film. No, I ran out of battery. I'm sorry. Oh, too bad. We are high up and the satellites are low so no one can see them from below. I see. This is all Cyrus! Cyrus the Great! VPNs, filter busters... Anything you want. Gail of Duly. Uh, Grand Theft Auto. That's impressive. Mmm. My sister doesn't even know what your name is, Davood. Maziar, you're famous. Hello. Hi. Whoa! All right, let's go, Davood. Bye-bye! Bye! Come on, Davood. We are running late. Okay, guys. Come on. - Maziar. Maziar. Bye-bye. Why don't you stick around, huh? We're gonna fix some dinner. We're gonna watch the debates. We can't, we have to... We have stuff... We'll come back. No, we have stuff to do. I have an interview. We'll be back. Hey, hey, hey- Next time. All right, let's work. Let's work. Let's go. Great. Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Um, all right. You set? Let's go. So, as a spy, I'm just trying to figure out why your country is so terrifying;. You know, the first thing to know about Iran is that it is not evil. Actually, Americans and Iranians have a lot of things in common, more than they have differences. What do I have in common with you? What is the number one enemy of the United States? Al-Qaeda. AI-Qaeda is also the number one enemy of Iran. The Al-Qaeda members say that I! you kit! an Iranian or if you kill a Shiite, you go to Heaven and you get 72 virgins. Well, they won't be virgins for too long, huh? Right? You know what I'm saying? Upstairs. I'm sorry. No, that was great. That was really great. Sorry, sorry. No, no, no' that was great! I know it's stupid. I'm an idiot. Do you want to ask him the "I'm a Jew" bit? You did great though. Uh... Or "Are you a terrorist?" Uh... Yeah. Yeah. Let's save the Jew bit for outside. We'll do the terrorist thing. That's, um... But no, that's great. Just... - Just try to keep it straight. - Okay, okay. And, uh, I'm the asshole. All right. So, yeah. So, one more quick question. Are you a terrorist? No. That sounds like something a terrorist would say. That was good? Okay. Yeah, that was great. Hey. What the hell was that? It's a TV show. It's supposed to be funny. Ah, I thought he was, uh, crazy, you know. Yeah. Vodka refreshment? No. Thank you. You are a pious man? I am a whiskey man. To the Greens! You know, Hamid is a good Muslim. He doesn't drink, he doesn't have a girlfriend but he doesn't stop us from going to hell either. Shut up, for God's sake! Watch. A fraud? The wife? Why would he go so low? No. This is as high as he can reach. I think he's afraid. I think he's scared. Yeah. Yes. He did well. He did well. Yes. Yes. Our man. Our man did good. Mr. Bahari? Yeah? Why did you put away your camera when you saw the satellites? Look, I've been doing this for many years. And there are certain situations, that if you film them, it won't do your friends or the movement any good. I know this regime very well. I know where the lines stand. Yeah, but if they are not afraid, why are you? Hey, guys, come. It's the revolution, Maziar. We're going to win tomorrow! Patna. Hey. Hey, listen to this. Listen to this. Listen. It's a huge demonstration. They're incredible. Yeah? They just want to be heard. They just want to be heard. They just want... They just want to be heard! Down, dictator! Maryam would be so proud to see this. - To the Greens! - To the Greens! Hey, Davood, I'm going inside. Sure. Okay. I'm going inside. Hi. Hello. My credentials. Hello. - Can you hold this? Thank you. - Yeah. Okay, you can go inside. Thank you. Not you. You stay here. I'll be back. I've been talking to a source who says the Supreme Leader has had his own private polling done. This suggests that the main opposition candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi is in the lead in all but one province. Hello. It's Alireza. Ahmadinejad has triumphed! How? A landslide! How would you know? The polls haven't closed yet. Praise Allah! A great victory, Mr. Bahari. Excuse me. Excuse me. I am a journalist. This is my accreditations. Who are you? I'm supposed to be inside. What is this? What are you doing? I'm a journalist. This is my accreditation. It says that I'm supposed to be inside. Your time is done. No, no. We are journalists. We are allowed... Huh? He has the papers in his hands. Now go. Leave! You're done. Okay, okay. We're leaving. Fine. Fine. Go, before I fuck both your mothers in front of you. Hey, hey... No, no, forget about it. Don't listen to him. Don't listen to him. Come on. Okay. Let's go. The government has announced that President Ahmadinejad has been re-elected with 62.6% of the vote. The challenger, Mir-Hossein Mousavi got... Did he really win? Two other candidates got less than 1%, They say. They've reported that Mousavi did not even carry his place of birth. His home. How unpopular he must be. You'd think they would have allowed him that. That he saw himself as having strong momentum going for him... Iran's Presidential election is ending in controversy. The opposition has called it fraud. For the fourth day in a row, a river of protesters stream through the streets of Tehran. These people feel that their election has been stolen from them. This government won't allow us to say what we want. We want freedom! We want freedom! You said you'd stay until the election. I know. But the election is over. I know. I know. This isn't like you. Lt's getting too dangerous. I have to stay here, Paola. Khamenei is doing the Friday prayers. Okay. Uh-huh. And? You know, he never does them himself. Or he rarely does them himself. And I think he's gonna use this opportunity to bring some sense into this and maybe, uh, validate people's concerns or, uh, talk about a recount of the election. Because something special is happening here... Mazi, what are you talking about? And stop moving around, you're making me nauseous. Please. Hmm. Okay. Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I will look into the flights tomorrow, okay? All right? Okay. And in the meantime, you and your round friend down there below, okay, you go to sleep, because it's getting late. You're lying. And you're beautiful. Ah... Good night. What's he saying, Maziar? He's saying that from now on, anyone that takes to the streets is gonna be held accountable for all the violence, all the blood and all the rioting that occurs. Do you think these demonstrations will continue? Yeah. I think so. I think it's my responsibility. When I stay home, I'm worried about other women, other boys that are here. And I think I should go, maybe I can help them. I think Pm a little braver new. History has taught me that all the, uh, revolutions start like this. Nothing stays like this forever. Mousavi! Hey, Davood! Wait, you're gonna get hurt! We have to fight back! What are you doing? Fighting back! You're gonna get killed! Come on. What do you want me to do, huh? They took my vote. I'm dirt to them. I'm dust. It's not right. It's not right, Davood. Ah, well, who are you to say? You have a real weapon and you choose not to use it. Oh, Jesus Christ! Sorry, no offense. None taken. God, Maziar, have you shown this to anyone else? No. Can we get this out tonight? Have you got time? Hmm? Yeah, no worries. Yep. It'll be in London before 7:00. How do you want this credited? Ah... Uncredited. They probably already know that you shot ii, because there's cameras everywhere especially around the Basij headquarters. I know. I know. Are you sure you want to go ahead with this? Yes. This has to be seen. Mazi jaan... Mazi jaan... Mmm. Wake up. These men want to talk with you. Get up, sir. And get dressed. We are here now. Turn to the left. Welcome to Abu Ghraib, or whatever you Americans like to call it. Put your blindfold back on. Your specialist will come to claim you soon. Stand up. Stand up! Give me the names! Stand up. I don't know! I swear, I don't know! All these lies, huh? All these lies! Fucking lies! I swear. I swear. I don't know. I can see the fucking time, but they're giving me all the rough cases. I know. But after this case, everything will be different. Of course. Next time, my love. Yes. I promise you. I promise you. I promise you, yes. Of course I understand. I have to go now. See you, my love. Bye. Sorry, sir. Is everything okay? I very much want this opportunity to work out for you, Javadi. Bahari is not some street thug. He will be well-prepared intellectually. Of course. I've given you the questions he must answer. But, Javadi, we must have his confession! Do you understand? Of course, sir. The people in the streets must know how they have been fooled by these traitors. We can end this, but we must show them how their leaders have been receiving orders from foreigners, Zionists and Jews in the West. They will listen to him, Javadi. Yes, sir. And remember, we need his face for the cameras. This will take much more than just a fist, Javadi. Yes, sir. Salted cucumbers. You must be hungry. Thank you, sir. I'm... I'm fine. It's salted cucumbers. You must be hungry. Yes, yes. Yes. I'm gonna have one. Mmm Mmm. Sir... Can you tell me why I am here? Because if this is about filming the demonstrations, I can assure you I am... You can film. I'm fully accredited by the Ministry of Culture... You can film. You know, it was just so sudden. It was... The camera was there and the violence erupted. But we have nothing to hide. So why then? Why? You are here because that's what happens to foreign spies caught on Iranian soil. Yes, we know you are a spy. A spy? Yes. The game is over, Mr. Bahari. And for who am la spy? For CIA, MIG, Mossad, Newsweek-You tell me. Newsweek me magazine'? No, Newsweek the carpenter. The media arm for CIA. No, no, sir. No, no. I can only go by the evidence. Sir, you are making a big mistake. I am a journalist That's it, nothing more. Just a journalist? Yes. As a spy, I'm just trying to figure out why your country is so terrifying. The first thing to know about Iran is that it is not evil. Americans and Iranians have a lot of things in common, more than they have differences. What do I have in common with you? So can you tell me why... just a journalist will meet up with this American spy on the eve of the unrest? He's not a spy. He's not a spy? He's... No, it's a show. It's a show? A comedy show. It's stupid... It's very stupid, yes. He's a comedian pretending to be a spy. So, can you tell me why an American pretending to be a spy had chosen to interview you? And why would a real spy have a TV show'? Why did you tell this man that America and Iran has something in common? Was that funny, too? You know, Khamenei said that America is the Great Satan. But maybe you don't think that's right. Maybe we have been hasty. We kicked America out of the door and you will bring them back through the windows. No, sir. I... Speaking to a person from the United States is not treason. Revolutions, just like people, they have to grow up. Do they? You little spy. It's all a show, Mazi. The blindfold. The shit food. "Your specialist is here." They are all putting on a play for you, Mazi. They say I am a spy. A spy! You're? A spy ? Yes, I know. I know, it sounds absurd. Well, it doesn't matter what they think. You will tell them nothing. There's nothing to tell. So you'll say nothing. I can't just say nothing. You must. You will. Well, this has been very helpful. Thank you for your counsel. I have nothing to tell them. Because I am not a spy. You underestimate them at your peril. They have learned much since the days of the Shah. Oh, my God. They thought they could break us with fists and feet. Belts and batons. They didn't know our strength. If they use sticks, you must be stone. If they use stone, you must be steel. And if they use steel, I... I must be titanium? Yes, Fm sorry. I forgot all those years you spent in prison. All that you've learned there. You were always smarter than everyone. No one knows but you. I am not being smart. I don't know if I can do this. You have to. I am not you nor Maryam. No, no, no. Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em in the eye! This is nothing, Maziar. They're a paper tiger, Maziar. Maziar... Mazi, look at me. Look a! me. Tell them nothing. Why did you ask the traitor Khatami if the election could be rigged? Who pays you in America? The CIA? How many Jews work for Newsweek? Who is Anton Chekhov? Anton Chekov? The playwright? Hey, you tell me. It is you who has listed an interest of him on Facebook. Confess. Who else are you working for? Why do you write so much to Bashiff? Three times you have visited New Jersey, America, in the time before the unrest. Why? Confess. I have a very good friend who lives there. You have friends in New Jersey? Yeah. My friend lives there, what can I do? He likes it there. Apricot. You want apricot? Yes. Thank you, sir. Are we not friends? Mmm-hmm. Yes. So why do you insult me? Insult you? No, no, I would never... Newsweek is an internationally distributed "weekly magazine headquartered in New York City. "It is privately owned and has operated for over 70 years." This is a schoolboy report. Sir, that is the truth. The truth is not an insult. The truth is you are a spy, working with the Americans and the Zionists to destroy our holy system. I'm not a spy. You are a spy. Yes. No, no, no. The American government doesn't control Newsweek magazine. To be honest, it's not even worth controlling anymore. Is it? Yes. Yes, it is. This weekly model of magazines is completely outdated. Outdated? There are better ways of doing propaganda. Through the Internet. In the blogs. Twitter. Uh... There's many things. The game has changed completely. So this is just a crazy theory? It is a little bit misinformed. Are we paranoid? You're not... Paranoid? I didn't say that. Are we paranoid? Are we paranoid? Sir... How are you feeling? Like shit. I apologize for my colleague. He is enthusiastic, but perhaps not as understanding of the intellectual nuances. Your father was imprisoned at one time, was he not'? Yes. When was this? In 1953. He was accused of being a communist. Yes. Was he? He was a communist back then. On whose authority was he detained? Under the Shah. Yes. The Shah of Iran. I'm sorry. Thai must have been difficult for your family. Thank you, sir. But I thought at that time, Iran had a democratic leader. Mossadegh. Mohammad Mossadegh. So there was a coup? Yes. Organized by? The CIA. The Americans, British... Operation Ajax I believe it was called. The West wanted the Iranian people's oil. Yes. And the journalists and gangsters that were paid by the CIA to spread lies and violence, and turn the Iranian people against its government so the Americans and Zionists could deploy their puppet the traitor, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi... Yes, but that was in those days, sir. I... But I am not a spy! Yes, Mr. Bahari, this is history! We are not crazy. This is not paranoia! Why did you meet with these saboteurs in the months leading to the unrest? Saboteurs'? They... They are normal people. They are not... They are friends of mine. They are not saboteurs. You will tell me. Or they will tell me. - Oh, no. - Seyyed! You have the wrong people, sir. These are not... You must not just take his blood, Javadi, you must take his hope. Yes, sir. Good morning, sir. Sir? I've been thinking, and I wanted to know your opinion about, uh, how the Americans do espionage these days. Is it very different from how it used to be in the '50s? Is n? Because I might have been tricked as well. I... I might have fallen into a trap. I don't... How is your beloved mother Moloojoon? She must be very worried. I... I don't know. I think she's fine... Good. I'm surprised. She did not contact us. Normally a prisoner's family can be very persistent. Visitors, lawyers... But for you, there has been none. Is media espionage a new field? Is it? You should call her soon. Poor woman. To lose her husband, God rest his soul and to lose her daughter, Maryam. And now this. Let's call her. You want to call her? Do you want to call her? Yes. Good. Call her. No answer? Strange. From now on, lam your mother. And father. Family! It is time to do this right, Mazi jaan. You must sign your confession. Hmm? You know, everything can be forgiven. Everything. Seyyed? I had forgotten just how fucking boring this place was. I used lo collect small pieces of limestone from the prison yard and shape them against the metal bars and play chess with them for hours and hours. Whatever it took to keep strong, sane. I'm thinking of signing the paper. Why? Because I would very much like to get out of here. You know, it's not just signing a piece of paper. They will make an example of you. So what? You will be on television. So what? You must leave here, but you must leave here a man. Maryam would understand. Maryam is not here. Lam. Maryam. Bahari! You are here for Maryam Bahari, right? Yes. You may see her. One half hour. Only the parents can go in. Why? Why? Don't touch him! You're going to kill me, boy'? You going to kill me'? Stay there! This is the boy. He said he would "get me. " I just wan! To see my sister. Blindfold. Mazi... Mazi jaan! Shame on you! You blindfold a 10-year-old? Shame on you! I will kill them and they can throw me in this shithouse. I want to kill you! No! No, Mazi! No! No! No, you can't. No! I need you out there. I need you out there. You must see all the films you can see, you must listen to the most beautiful music you can find. Okay? I will live that through you. Be that for me, okay? Promise? Okay. It's okay. It's okay. No, Mazi. No. I'm concentrating. You should see, I mean, you look really... You look really good from here. Stop it. Turn it off. Don't move. Don't... Don't move. I'm embarrassed. Put it away. No, it's okay. My bosses are not happy with you. But I don't understand. I'm trying to do everything you want me... I am trying to figure out the media conspiracy, but I cannot lie to you. I know. Huh? I know this. But they have decided to kill you. I brought you a Nescaf. Why... Why do they want to kill me? There is milk and sugar. You don't like my Nescaf? I don't understand what they can achieve by killing me. You don't like my Nescaf. Blindfold. It's... Blindfold. Now is the time. No... No, don't! No, no! No... What a terrible thing for a wife to lose her husband. A mother, her son. For a child to grow up and never know their father, that's a terrible thing. - What are you doing? - You should see. I mean, you look really... You look really good from here. No, Mazi. No. But the choice is yours. You will go on television and tell how you lied to our great people, how you put anti-revolutionary elements in touch with the foreign agents. And you will apologize to our great Master for breaking his heart. You will do all this, or your beautiful wife will be a widow. I apologize... I apologize... I apologize to all the Iranian people for what they saw. I am not a person... Baba, please, please. I'm trying to learn this. You never had to do this. You never had to speak on television. You always kept your integrity intact. You never faced this. They barely touched you. Others have suffered more. No, Baba. No, no. You don't understand. You were what they said you were. You can choose who you are. I am not a spy. Lam not a spy... They locked you up, but you are still free. You don't understand, Baba! You were who they said you were. You filmed the truth about these sisterfuckers. What is more dangerous to them than the truth. huh? Tel! me. It didn't change anything. Look where it got me. God damn it, believe in something;. It is your only hope. Like communism? Did it ever occur to you that the dream that kept you during your torment, it was corrupt? Your great Russian heroes, they also torture. Your torture was conceived in the Gulags. Where do you think the Shah's secret police got it from? From the Soviets. From the CIA, from the Mossad. From all the fucked up secret services of the world. Was it worth it? Was it worth leaving a mother and a child on their own? I'm going to learn this. I'm going to say it on camera. And then I'm going to go home. What is your name? And tell us about your role in the colored coup d'tat. My name is Maziar Bahari. And I am a member of the western media. I am a journalist, and as such, I am a member of the Western capitalist machine. Western media saw its candidate lose the elections, on June the 12th of 2009. Western media claimed it was a fraud to undermine and to hurt the legitimacy of the elections. Western media afterwards claimed that there was a coup. What followed was a series of preplanned actions designed to foment a failed color revolution. My colleagues and I started to ignore accurate reporting and we produced reports that were very inaccurate and illegal. I apologize to the Iranian people. ...and to my family. And to our Supreme Leader for my actions and my wrongdoings. Seyyed! That's it'!? Davood? Maziar? Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened? No, no, no, it's nothing. Come on. I am sorry. I am very sorry to put you through this mess. Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I told them everything I knew about you and your activities. Why didn't you tell me you were the mastermind of the green revolution, hmm'? I could have doubled my driver fees. I'm very sorry, Davood. I'm going to get you out of here. As soon as I come out, I'm going to do everything I can. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Specialist time. Yes? Yes. Stay. Javadi. Yes, sir? Four thugs beat up a Basij. I want them to feel 10 punches for every punch they gave. But Bahari confessed. Yes, yes, yes. The thugs. Yes, sir. What's wrong? Blindfold! What? Blindfold! Sir, what's happening? I confessed! You did nothing. I confessed! You did nothing! Sir, I said exactly what you wanted me to say. You confessed, but nothing has changed! I did what you told me to do! I will see to it that you rot here, dirty spy. I'm no spy. sir. Your wife will never see you again. Oh, sir... Your child... Your child will never know you! And your mother will die brokenhearted. And you did this! No... Sir, please. No... Please... Please. Get down. Please... Get down! Get down! Motherfucker! Please... Please stop. You spread these lies! Answer the question! Answer the questions! I'm forgotten. Maryam... I'm afraid. You? You're afraid? They are afraid. They've tortured you for the crime of bearing witness. This is fear. They are scared of you. They are weak, Mazi jaan. Not you. Use your freedom. Use their weakness. Use their weakness. Fight, Mazi. You have a lot of women's phone numbers. Does your wife know about your cheating? Shirin Ebadi. You have four numbers for her. When and where did you have sex with her? She is a very respectable and married woman. Yes. I interviewed her a couple of times. If you never fucked her, why do you have four numbers for her? I also have 10 numbers for Ahmadinejad. Why all this traveling? All these numbers. Why? What is this? This is porno? Porno? How many girlfriends do you have? Why all these numbers? Why? How many times do you have sex with them? Why? Why? Are they whores? Why all this traveling? Why? lam ashamed to say, sir. What's that, spy? What do you mean? No, I shouldn't tell you. Please don't... Don't make me do this. You can tell me anything. That's why you are here. Well... I travel to all these places... Yeah. Because I enjoy massage. Massage? What do you mean? Massage. Massage... Yeah, massage. Of a sexual nature. I can't believe I'm telling you this. I... I shouldn't... I shouldn't.4. No, no, no. It's good. Go on. I travel regularly to get these massages because I find myself addicted to them. It helps satisfy my need. Hmm. These massage, are they expensive? No. No, they're actually quite reasonably priced. You walk into an establishment, and they are there, lined up. All of them. Very beautiful. Very... Very young. And you choose the girl that you like, and they take you by the hand and they lead you to a room that has a waterbed. Then she starts to undress you. And she undresses herself as well. But I probably shouldn't tell you this. I probably shouldn't No, no, no, please continue. No, I don't want to continue. Please. This could... No. This could be very important information. Son. There is one massage that is called... You wouldn't believe this, sir. It's called the Persian massage. It comes from the time of Cyrus The Great. And what it consists of is three girls at the same time. The girls are very professional and they know exactly what they are doing. And they immediately start squeezing you. They squeeze you and they release you, and they squeeze you and they release you. And it is the best feeling, sir. Four trips to America. So why all these trips? I was desperate. Yes. The reason I went to New Jersey... You know what happens in New Jersey. Yeah, of course. Everybody knows what happens in New Jersey. Oh. I... I... I had to see it with my own eyes. What did you see? Well, there is this place that's called Fort Lee. It's a military town? It used to be, sir. Now it is a massage playground. And it is massages from allover the world. Oh. So I went there because I had heard crazy stories. Crazy stories about people dying. Dying? Yes. What do you mean? Of pleasure. Of pleasure? Unbelievable. Not for New Jersey. No? No. Newsweek reporter Maziar Bahari has been arrested. What is your reaction to that? Well, I am just appalled at the treatment that Mr. Bahari and others are receiving. It is a show trial. Thai explains this very silly move you did there. Yeah, which one? Specialist time, Mr. Hillary Clinton. What did you say? Mr. Hillary Clinton. She's been talking a lot about you. Sheytoon. Naughty boy. Hello? Salaam. They've taken Mazi! The government. We need a lawyer. There must be something we can do! How long has he been in there? How long? Too long! Even one day is too long. I've sent letters to the Italian and the Canadian embassy. And we've also got some petitions up on the website. I'm six and a half months pregnant. And it's important to remain positive. Maziar Bahari is the correspondent for Newsweek... He's not been seen by his family since his detention six months ago. Maziar Bahari is being held now according to... We're trying very hard to get as much publicity as possible. We've expressed our concern about Mr. Bahari's confinement. It is a sign of weakness. Your wife talks too much. She is talking badly about Iran. Doing interviews. Writing letters. Stand up. No, sir. No... Stand up. Please... Stand up. Blindfold Off. Call her. My wife? Call her. Yes, sir. Yes. Call her and tell her to stop talking shit. And you have to dial nine to get out. Nine? Nine. Okay. Hello. Paola? Mazi, hi. Hi! Are you okay? Mazi, everyone's supporting you. Everyone. We'll get you out, Mazi. The baby? The baby is fine. The baby is great, actually. We're having a girl, my love. Be a man. Be a man. Marianna Maryam Bahari. I love you. I love you, Mazi. Be a man. Control this woman! She cannot talk badly about us! You have to stop her and control her! She cannot talk badly about us! She cannot speak to anybody about you! You have to control her! Okay. Okay. Shall I call her again? What are you doing? Stop, please. No, stop. Thank you. No. Thank you. Please stop. To Marianna! Maryam Bahari! Marianna! Maryam Bahari! Did I torture you? Did I? I tell you, my father was tortured by the SAVAK. They beat him up so badly that he couldn't walk. Even now, 30 years later. I did not do that to you. If this is not torture then what is it? Many people seek to destroy us. And many people don't admit that easily. I was not seeking this. Good. A pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bahari. And it's a pleasure, sir. I hope your time here has not been too unpleasant. Well, the nature of prison is... It's prison, right? Yes. Please. Yes. As you know, the discipline of media espionage is a new one. Oh, yes, it is everywhere. It's a new trend. The West has been quite effective in blurring the line between a spy and journalists. We must catch up if we are to battle effectively. Do you understand? Do you want me to become a spy? We want you to help our holy system with information. Now' this is a letter of commitment... Mmm-hmm. ...Mr. Bahari. Read it thoroughly, sign it, stamp it. The letter basically is for you to provide us with reports, information, any anti-Iran activity. And the letter... Yes. Yes. Excellent. Specialist. Because of your diligence and good work on behalf of Islamic Republic, this man is back on the path of righteousness. Seyyed! Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bahari. Blindfold. Thank you, sir. Thank you. So the man they accused of being a spy is not a spy. But if you would like to become a spy, you know, for us, that would be appreciated. Bahari. Seyyed. Come. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of Captain Dazmond and the entire crew, welcome aboard ight number 3826. Nonstop service from Tehran to London. Our ight time will be six hours and 15 minutes. Si! back, relax, and enjoy the flight. Would you like some coffee, sir? And here's your tea. Thanks very much. Coffee or tea? Finally, I was free. But my joy is tempered by those I left behind. People that did not have the advantage of international attention. Countrymen and women, whose only crime against the state is not believing in its perfection. And the acolytes. Those without imagination. "(hose who, even in my confinement, were more alone and afraid than I. Because in their hearts, they know they cannot win.
