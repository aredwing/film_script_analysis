Getting late to bus, give me your autograph. Why? Don't know when we'll meet again. Our friendship will not end with autographs, friendship doesn't mean living together in college, but sharing joys and griefs all the life together. Let's meet whenever it's possible. It's easier said than done. If we strongly wish to meet, we can under any circumstances. We can meet how far we may be. I'll arrange for our meeting. Have you finished eating? Canteen is closing. Get down from the stage! What's this? You're married and have children too, still haven't changed. We're meeting to have fun and re-energise our lives. Get down. Notjust we, our families too must re-energise. My son will perform a dance now. My daughter will dance now. Stop talking now, had food? We did have, he'll never change. My business deal is done, I'll settle down in Switzerland. I'm shifting my office to Delhi, I'll stay there only. We were meeting since we lived near by, will it be possible to meet if you go far away places? We decided then and met now, right? Where there's a will, there's a way. We'll surely meet, watch out. - Definitely. Prabha, come here. What's it uncle? Your dance was excellent. Which class? - Seventh class, uncle. Is it? Which rank? That's the biggest problem with him. Seventh class second year. Stop dances and start concentrating on studies. Hey! Who are you? It seems above the sky, there are stars... So what? When I dance, every star must come down... Don't know who will become what... Don't know who will meet whom... If friend becomes your shadow, the fun will never stop... Man having blast today is the hero of tomorrow... If you don't dream thinking dreams will not come true... You'll miss the happiness of the dream... Nothing will change with date if you remain as yourself... Roaming like a wastrel is also luck, that's all... I'll pick you up at 9 am tomorrow, right? What? Joke? Sorry, I don't have any such idea. Why is your voice dull, Nisha? Tell me dear, no problem. You keep everything to yourself, never share anything with me. Brother... Flyover contract has been bagged by Rao's Company. We've lost Rs. 30 crores. How many times I've told you not to disturb when I'm talking to my daughter? Dear, I'll come late to home. You eat, dear. You don't need English to convey emotions. Any language will do. I can understand the tension you're feeling to manage, and also the intention behind it. Tell me... how much you took from them? No sir, I didn't take anything. Really sir. Trust me... - Rs.30 crores is not a big deal. I can earn it in 3 days. But you betrayed me, I won't tolerate it. Tell me, how much you took from them? I made a mistake, please forgive me sir. I beg you sir, please leave me. I'll spare anyone but not a betrayer. If I've to leave, then I'll leave like this. She's Prabhas' mother. Though she's trying to learn English for she hasn't yet picked up An incident happened in city that evoked lot of interest, like every brain has an idea and every tongue has a taste, a group of college students celebrated their farewell, on different roads with dances instead of college campus. Traffic was disrupted in many places because of it. Prabha! You're ruining family honour. Is it the way you go to college? I'll complain to your father. Watch live updates on it every hour, keep watching the uninterrupted live telecast. Have you seen on TV? I'll come home and watch it. Your son is dancing on roads. Our honour is going to dogs. I'm already tensed, cut the line. Stop... stop... the car. Who do you think he is? Criminal lawyer Hanumantha Rao. That's why I'm stopping. Do you know what you're saying? - What's the problem there? How many times I've told him yet he has no sense. Why do you come so many times and get insulted? Please never come again, sir. We'll lose ourjobs. Who is it? - Father! What's this father? Travelling in a Benz! Belongs to a client. - Client's. You go, tell sir, I'll call him. - Okay sir. Go. A birthday party, you're not coming with us. I'll come there. - How can you? Will he leave you? I'll jump the wall. - Go home! ...dancing in public, everybody is watching... Oh mother! Please don't kill us with your English. Has mother become so cheap to you? When you were in Inter, I thought it was upto home only, when in college, I thought it was upto district only, do you've to make it a state wide issue if you pass graduation? In which channel? - Gemini TV. Don't you've any shame, son? Just one Gemini TV only? Couldn't make it to NDTV? BBC? CNN? My fate! Father and son will never reform in this life.

Rajeshwari, that was his last day in college, birthdays, marriage days will come every year, but farewell day comes only once in life. Who is tomato? Who else, you! Keep quiet. Hi Aunty! - When did you come from Vizag? - Today. She did her MBA here, we went to college for her certificates, but called us tomorrow, I said Prabha will come for it. Where's brother? Haven't met him for long time? I'm in bathroom, just a minute. He'll come. It seems girls in my college are not beautiful, so he's not coming to me also, you know that? Like father like son! Hubby! Viswanadham from Swiss. What? Are you coming to India in 2 days with your son and daughter? Will Bhadram give other details? What's this? Yes, we all friends are having a get together meet in my home. No, usually I arrange the meeting, right? We wanted to surprize you, last time everyone didn't turn up. This time it's special, after 10 years, all our friends are coming with their families. Let's have a blast re-living those olden golden college days. We'll never give up this friendship... Why are you getting so emotional, son? On whom? Aren't your friends my friends? We are meeting after ten years. Let's rock, father. No way! Why? We've to arrange a lot of things, we are leaving today. Go to college tomorrow, take the certificate and come. Uncle... uncle... - Just do as uncle says. You can't avoid brother, I need my certificates. Always troublesome. Sensational! What? My music? Your beard! Friends meeting after 10 years with their families, isn't it great to hear? We'll also join you. We'll also have a good time. I don't want you there, you'll spoil my fun. You always stop us, are we competitors to you? Look at your height and ours, you don't care much about your friends, you don't give any value to friendship... He'll not speak any more, take him away. You managed him, we'll come, what will you do? Can I avoid? I'll take you. Did Nisha propose to you yesterday? She did. So what? - What did you tell her? What would I say? Don't you know about my love story? I'm waiting for Nandhini, how can I say yes to Nisha? We're in trouble, she tried to commit suicide. What? Suicide? Yes, she's in hospital now. Her condition is very serious. Where are you going? - Hospital. You'll not come back alive from there. Do you know who her father is? For your safety, run away to some other place. Why should I run away? Because his daughter has tried to commit suicide. He'll not only spare you but your family too. I'm going to station along with Bhadram, your mother has gone to Ameerpet to shop with Prasanna. You pick up and drop them in station. Okay dad. We are going to Vizag tomorrow, right? Why not today itself? Tell me where's Prahhas? - Don't know. Tell me... tell me... - I don't know. Tell me! Tell me! - I don't know. Tell me! Nisha's father has sent his goons for you. They are beating up our friends, I managed to give them a slip, I took a video of them beating our friends, they may come for you, so I'm sending you MMS, be careful, buddy! Walk faster. They'll be waiting for us in railway station. Where's brother? How is it? - Yuck! No! Not good? You come. We are getting late. Shall we see some bags in that shop, aunty? No, let's go. Come fast. Come to that shop. Two for Rs.100! Brother! Pant! Why are they quoting high rates like a shop? How much? What happened? My sweet son! - Yes. Brainless fellows! How they are fighting on roads? Don't know from where they come? They must be taken to police station and given a good thrashing. Don't stare at them, don't look at them. What's it son? - Love, mother, love... Auto, take them to railway station. I'm Nisha's father. You must be with me in 10 minutes. What if I refuse? You beat my men and left them alive, I'll never commit such a mistake, your friends are with me, you love your friends, don't you? You'll definitely come. I know it. Why are you inviting him here without bumping him off there, boss? What did you say your name was? It's Prabhas, right? Look, my daughter is mad. She always hides everything in heart, that's why she tried to commit suicide, if she had told me she loves you, I would've got you both married by now. But, you're very lucky. If anything had happened to her, by now you'd be... Day after tomorrow you're marrying my daughter, be ready. Marriage... - Ask your parents to meet me. I don't like this marriage. Stop... okay, I'll marry her. But please listen to me once. Nisha is really lucky to have such a loving father like you. She'll be happy only when the man she marries her loves as much. Love and marriage happens only when both like each other. What are you saying? Why don't you like it? Tell me, why don't you like it? Because, my heart is not with me. Last year I went to Switzerland for a music program. I've told the organiser of Swiss Telugu association, that you all are right and left hands of AR Rahman and Mani Sharma. enjoy the summer holidays. You must leave in 2 days. I've already mailed them this photo. Did you see? Rahman, Mani Sharma and Devisri. Will it work out, buddy? You can sing, you will, but we don't know much. Just follow my style. I feel like children of Goddess of Learning have come down. Who are they? Are they also here to sing? Who is this half baked man? He doesn't have much command on language. Language? Is he also a singer? Why didn't you tell me? Buddy, it's very easy to manage him. You must give me all the details, right? Did you have food? They will, just now got down from the flight, they'll freshen up and eat. Who amongst you is left hand of Rahman? Me sir! It's me! Rahman is very close to me. - You could've told me that earlier. Why are you getting so tensed? Rahman always tell me that's your weakness. Victory! Victory? My heart almost stopped. Will you have food? - They will eat, keep quiet. Still 4 days to start the program, till then... - Want us to enjoy? Practice! We've arranged this program spending big money, if anything goes wrong... - You'll see our talent. What talent? Michael Jackson rocked the world by your age. Do you know, Hitler committed suicide by your age? Nothing about you sir. Boys, get going. - Yes, coming. What a place! - Yes, indeed very nice! Hello, go speed. Go slow! She's going away... take left... take left. We're going right side. You bloody! You can go without underwear but never go out without your passport. If you get caught with police, you'll be behind bars for a week. Oh no! I don't have my passport. Where are you going, Prabha? Go left. - We must go right. Bloody! How many times you've come late? - It was my mistake. It's not mistake but your habit. Don't pay her. Don't ever call her again to sing in chorus. I'll never commit such a mistake again. Please give me an opportunity to confess, Father. How many times should I forgive you? This is better. - Please listen to me Father. You fall at feet, this is bad habit. They say you mustn't hide anything from father and church Father. That's why I'll tell you a truth. What is it? My dad was drinking entire night despite I warned him not to, I too had a little getting curious of what really does it have? Did you drink? Why did you do like that? Fate, Father. What happened then? I understood my father. - What's that? Another peg will be better. What happened then? What will happen? I had a full bottle, Father When I woke up, it was 9 am. That's why I came late to church. You sinner! If I allow you into church, you'll spoil other girls too. Take off this holy dress and leave the church immediately. Keep the dress here and leave the church. How am I to start it? What a figure! Telugu girl! I know face reading. Once I look at anyone I can tell their horoscope. God gave you an angel's beauty but a devil's heart. You're eating a stolen chocolate now. You've the habit of stealing two things at time, it's in your bag, you steal two things on asking anything, stop... come here. The lips that should taste only nectar, did you drink till late night? One peg... no, two pegs ...three pegs! A full bottle?! Get lost man! Why are you murdering the song? They'll understand it like this only. Where's Prabha? It's time to practice. How can he be here? He met a Telugu girl, right? He would've gone after her. - For a girl? You can escape from police also, if you fall for any Telugu girl here, you're dead. Telugu people are so powerful and dangerous here. Did we come this far to die? The only one who knows music is Prabha, we came here trusting him to make some money, now we are in a fix? If we leave him, our program will get upset, you do something. Why is he telling us to do something? What's this your voice is changed? Music troupe from India? - It's us! No problem. I love music. - We too. I heard you don't have female singer, so I'm here to sing for you. Please give me one chance sir. We can but do you've any singing experience? - Buddy! Chorus singer in church. - Chorus? He's a pain. What's it? Prabhas saw this girl only. - What? Oh my God! How am I to tell him? What? Who? - What? SPB? He has now work, he recommends to make Chitra sing for Shreya. Tell him, I'll call back later. Please get me that opportunity sir. My voice will be good. No need to sing now, come tomorrow here at the same time. Let's think about it then. This is too much. We too had same feeling earlier. - Bye sir. I'll come tomorrow at same time. - Okay. Isn't she like heroine? Not like indeed she's the heroine. Telugu heroine in Switzerland! Prabha met this girl only today morning. Why are you telling it now? Why didn't you tell me that little earlier? I said about SPB's phone to tell you that only. But you used it to build up your image. Bloody, she was some where else you brought her next to him now. It'll be very easy for him now to flatter her. I've no doubt, our bodies will also not go back to India. Luckily we know her, it's very easy to create misunderstanding between them. They have booked a room in star hotel, what are you doing sitting out here? Where did you go away without practicing? Who is that girl? How did you find it? Can't I guess if you look at sky like a mad man? You're right. - Who is that girl? She's... she's... not a girl. Buddy, she's an angel who has come down to earth. You don't feel too much, let's send her back in some flight. Never take hasty decision in selcting girl friend and cell phone. If you like and buy it, new models will come later and tempt you. You'll not say this if you see her. That is... he saw her! - No, I didn't. He didn't see her. The girl touched my heart. Swiss girls do touch your hearts only. A girl came today morning to sing in our troupe. If you see her, I'm sure you'll say I love you to her. Bloody... fool... how do I look like to you? Would I say I love you to any girl I meet? I'm sure you'll if you see her. - No chance. What if you do? - I will not. You'll fall in love if you see her. I will not. - You will love her. I'll not love her. - Then let's have a bet. What bloody bet? We'll show you that girl tomorrow, if you feel like falling in love with her, not only to her, you mustn't express your love to any girl in Switzerland. Okay will not do, we need a firm promise. Promise on him. Should I promise on my dad? I think our son is thinking about you. Buddy, think over it again. You can't change promise after seeing her. You've promised on your dad. If anything happens to him... - Why are you so scared? Will she be so beautiful? Come... come... show me. Where is she? Come. Show me... No need to be so confident, you'll fall flat. Where did he go away? Where is the girl? She said she's busy and will not come, that girl in the bouquet shop. The girl in that shop? - Yes, that girl only. The girl with bouquet? Isn't she like an angel? You feel like saying I love you to her, right? - No, I don't feel. Hastily I promised on my dad. But she's also very beautiful. I promised. - Yes. I mustn't say I love you. - Yes. How dare you fix me like this! What if she says it? Is it okay to you? Lt'll not break the promise, right? That girl will say I love you to me. That girl will say... - Will she say? That girl... will say I love you. Shut up! You made him promise and laughing now. We know about him well, do you know what we did before this scene opened? Looks like she has this disease. I heard your voice by rewinding last evening's encounter. I've decided to use your voice. If you sing in my troupe, you'll be on moon in future, your life will change completely, but we've a small problem. - What's it sir? That is... I don't know how am I to tell you? No problem, please tell me sir. There's a 6 feet, six pack Prabha in my troupe, though he doesn't have much knowledge of music, any girl falls in love with him easily, if you also fall for him, program will get upset and your future will be ruined. Do you've this talent too? - Is this a problem? Who is he? Look there! That's him! Next to the French bearded man. That's him! He's a face reader and tells the horoscope. You're shocked! Have you fallen in love with him at first sight? I love music. I hate love. I don't want to be a singer, good bye to you and your troupe. Please listen to me... Please... Thank you very much. How is it? - Excellent buddy! We can happily practice now without any disturbance. Let's do it. Get up! Getting late. - What's this sister? Sister, your breakfast. Have you forgotten it? Go! Come fast, we are getting late. Go... go... You... you... it's you... I feel everything in this world is second to you... Whatever has happened it would've happened because of you only... You appear before me, where ever I'm going... You're moving me though I'm alone... You're charming me, whatever I'm thinking... You're making me happy, though you're not before me... Happiness in a moment and doubt in the next moment... Thinking about you only in sleep also... It's always you in my eyes... I've gone mad thinking about you... O my love... What? Program is cancelled? Why? IT market is down and sponsors have backed out. Those who brought tickets want refund. It seems they can buy a flat with ticket money. I pledged my wife's jewels for the troupe's travel and stay. What am I to do now? Trusting Ramana Reddy has cost me dearly. I forgot to ask you, did you have food? Very nice! - How long should I wait? Bloody, I'm waiting. You bloody idiots! Why did you spoil the mood? The girl left. My foot! You're in trouble. Program is cancelled. Cancelled? We are practicing day and night, and you say it's cancelled. All out time is wasted. - Pay us something and settle us. I'll not settle you, infact you must pay me. Why? - Why? To have fed you like pigs. Who will pay for it? Sometimes our money goes drown the drain, you mustn't mind it. Sometimes passports too get torn, you mustn't bother about it. Where can we bring so much money? You practiced day and night, right? Sing on roads to earn. Whatever name you may give it, return my money, take your passports. Okay? - Okay. Till then stay here only. - Thank God. I didn't mean here. Where to? What happened, buddy? Bloody! Stop... Just now came to know there are slums in Switzerland too. Couldn't they've made 'Slumdog Millionaire' here? Our lives weren't so bad even in Hyderabad. He showed us hell, you must show your power to him, buddy. Where is Butch Thomas? What? It seems you threatened the boys not to go to India. Yes, I did threaten them. So what? We'll not go, we'll stay back here only. Don't give our passports too. We'll go after settling your dues. But please change the room. It's very dirty. That's respect. What the hell did you do? You boasted with us and then fell at his feet. You ruined our honour. Do you've any sense? Why are you tensed? Program is cancelled. That's all, isn't it? I've managed to get a sponsor. Our show will go on. - Really, buddy? Promise. - Will it work out? Why will it not work out? I've been trying for long. She'll accept. - She'll accept? You mean a lady sponsor. Wait! Aren't there women sponsors? You carry on darling. I'll follow the sponsor and work out. Till then be on the job of settling Thomas' dues. Should we've beg for it? - Why do you want my permission? You did a good thing today. I'm scared of you because you know everything about me. Please don't follow and torture me. My legs involuntarily walk towards you only... I went silent because of you only... I'm talking about you only with everyone... I too have become like you only... Though everyone around is abusing, I'll not listen to any of it... ~ Digital Desi Releasers ~ What do you want for your birthday? Wait for 5 minutes. I'll deliver this. - Okay. Nani, come here. Why hasn't sister come back? - She'll come. Don't worry. Sister... sister... Sister! What happened? Nani and Ritu are missing. Did you see them? You know face reading, right? Tell me where are they? That's him, today is his birthday. I told them to wait there only. Please Prabha, tell me. Don't laugh! What did you promise and what have you done? You promised on your dad, yet... cheated us. I'm still bound by the promise. Not only that girl, I would've helped any girl in that position. Our fate! I think we'll never go back to India. What the hell are you blabbering? What do you want me to do? You must come with us from tomorrow. There's stamina to win in heart... There's a soft loving heart in a corner... If he listens to our song without missing a word... Jackson will come back to earth from heaven... Song of heart is playing out on guitar... Fate is clapping hands... When struggle becomes your companion, won't victory be yours? With your music, let the chariot march ahead... You've love armoury to protect you... Which ever country it may, our message is same... Which ever stage it may be, our dances are a celebration... Our songs are stream of thought that flows between sky and earth... This is modern era where voices of the poorjoined in chorus... This is the time when world has seen it's power... ~ Digital Desi Releasers ~ What's this? Your passports and flight tickets. Go back to India immediately. Why all of a sudden? What happened? Don't you know what has happened? I had warned you on arrival. Stay away from girls. You love Nandhini. Do you know who is Nandhini? Daughter of my friend who is in Texas. He left her in my care trusting me. If he comes to know about your love, he'll kill me also along with you. That's why you leave this place immediately. Come on... say you love me. Come on say it... say it... What are you saying sir? How can I love Nandhini? She's a mad girl. Mad about music. That's why she was after us. Anyway we're here to make money. Not to fall in love. You don't imagine things. Don't narrate tales to me. Leave immediately. Please listen to me once. Give us two days time. We'll leave after earning money. We'll pay you also. I don't want money, I want to save my life. Leave immediately. - How can we if you say suddenly? You love Nandhini, why were you so harsh on her? Didn't you make me promise worse than that? Sorry, we got afraid of Buchi. - And made me promise. He's just a comedian. You made me promise not to say I love you to her, So I thought I would make her say it. Nandhini loves me. I wanted her to express it first. If we have two days time, Nandhini will say I love you any moment. That's why I was little harsh about her with him. Okay, what shall we do now? Whatelse can we do? Let's go back to India. India? If we wait for two days... Let's go. Prabha has come for you. Tell him I'm not here. He's going back to India. - So what? Told you tell him I'm not here. He risked his life to save us, why are you behaving like this? What happened to you? If he doesn't love me, why should I let him know I love him? What's it? What? I want to tell you something. - Go ahead. Why are you covering your face? You've done something wrong. - Yes, I committed a mistake. But I don't owe any explanation to you. You're going back to India, right? What is this? You love Prabha, right? Then, why don't you tell him? He said I'm mad. Did he say directly with you that he doesn't love you? Think over it again. Prabha has come to you before going back to India, he wouldn't come unless it's very important, right? What if he had come to express his love? Why don't you talk to him? I'm not able to talk to him after knowing I'm not in his heart. You don't say anything, just stand before him, he knows face reading, right? He may start loving you after knowing about your love for him. Go, if you miss him now, you may not get him again in life. Go! You wanted to say something, what's that? That is... how am I to tell you? No problem, tell me. Tell me. - I don't... l... Come on tell me. - I don't know face reading. This is a gift by a girl who loves me without really knowing me, I don't know if she loves me or not, I don't want to keep it with me without knowing that, you're a good girl, keep this gift with you. If you love anyone in future, you can give it to him. Take it Nandhini, if it's with you, I'll take it as she loves me. If you love someone else, why should I take this gift? Go to hell! Stop! Nothing will happen to you. Why are you crying? It seems Nandhini has sank into coma. What happened then? She'll come... My Nandhini will come for me. She'll come, your Nandhini will definitely come for you. I'll manage my daughter. Go! It's true you love Nandhini from young age, it's true, she lives in Switzerland, it's true you've downloaded Nandhini's photos from Internet, but when did we go to Switzerland? What's all this cooked up story? What could I do? He was pointing a gun on your head and insisting I marry his daughter, you know one thing, I'm going to meet Nandhini tomorrow for the first time after 15 years. She'll be in India for 10 days only. Should we need violence now? That's why I cooked up a story for him. You cooked up a brilliant story extempore. I didn't cook anything, I just told him my love for Nandhini in words. Our real love story starts from tomorrow. Uncle Butchaiah! Oh! You made Butchaiah as Butch Thomas. Uncle... uncle... - It's unbelievable, buddy. It looks exactly like your story opening scene. It was airport but railway station here. That's all. - Greetings... - Uncle! Are they your friends? - Yes... Did you all have food? Same character, only backdrop has changed. What's he saying about backdrop? Let's discuss later, let's go home first. Come and have food. - You must eat well. Everyone has come? - All have come, it's fun and frolic. All have come except Viswam's daughter Nandhini from Switzerland. Daddy, enough of offering prayers, there's lot of work to do. This is our ancestral property, let me offer prayers peacefully. Children! Have you had food? - No, we'll have it later. I'll kill you kids... skipping lunch in the game. Stock over? Fill the empty bottles with cheap liquor and sell it. People only see labels not the stock inside. He was church father in your story but he's a wine shop owner in real. Isn't his character different? Buddy, it's fun and festivities all over the home. But I feel like I'm in a cemetery. We don't have anything here, let's go back to Hyderabad. No, how can we leave to Hyderabad immediately... My sister calls me James Bond. All others call me Firebrand. Your Swiss brother-in-law? He's also here. Shall we play cricket? Get lost half ticket. Why are you all dull? Problem? Why did we all came here? Look at his face! You've come alone without your sister... Why is he saying sister? Not sister he's saying mister. I'll tell him. Why are they saying sister? Trying to flatter sister. Am I a half ticket? Your son? Did you recognise him? Your childhood dance partner Nandhini's dad. Why didn't you tell us about his character in your story? He hates me from my childhood, that's why censored. There wasn't a villain in story but we have one here. He was a dull student, he failed seventh class twice or thrice... That was then. Now a brilliant student. Am I a brilliant student? - Just to build image. Children want a swing, go to the next town and get it. Do I look like a porter? - People may over hear you. It's all out family, it's not wrong to do our work ourselves. I can't do it father, I'm going back to Hyderabad. Find someone else to do it. Why are you leaving suddenly? Why a gang is going for a swing? Just one man is enough. He's not going to get a swing, he's going back to Hyderabad. We are meeting after 10 years, you must enjoy it, why are you leaving now? You enjoy it, just out of your college, youth, have a blast. We'll go. We are here to refresh. You refresh yourselves, we are leaving. Why are you leaving now? Your uncle wants you to stay here. Friend's marriage, I must go, father. If not this marriage, you can meet your friends in another marriage. We are meeting once in why do you want to leave now? What's that for? Okay, go. Come on boys. Bad luck boy. What's that code language? It means he's fixed. Gate closed here too. Your story was indeed great. But Nandhini didn't turn up. If Nisha's father comes to know this is fake story, he'll kill us. He's sad and you're adding to his woes by telling about him. What if we go to Switzerland for Nandhini? Look there! Everyone is following line and he's trying to overtake. Do you've sense? Who gave you license? All are coming in line, are you special? I'll beat you, go back. I told him to overtake. What sorry? You look educated. Can't you use common sense? I'll talk to her. How many have to tell you? Arrogance of money? Remove your car. Atleast you tell those filthy rich people. Madam, please leave it. I'll talk to her. Please listen... - You stop it. Sister, come. Are you inside only? You go... go... l'll talk to them. Are you a traffic policeman? What bothers you if the car overtakes? Unnecessarily you made my darling abused in public. Why? You knew about your darling's arrival because of this trouble, right? Had wee been to Hyderabad silently, we wouldn't have know it? Thank God saved. Please do something. Father! - What happened son? Marriage is stopped. - Why? Why? Bride is dead, dad. You've to tell another story why she died, say her mother is dead. Bride's mother, father. - How? Why are you crying for her? Feel fatherafeel, please don't ask me questions, father. Okay, you go home. Okay father, have good time with your friends. I'll go home. What's your confusion, son? Would you like to come back here? You're fixed mentally that I'm gone. It won't be nice if I return. - I'm telling you come back. Okay dad. Come. - Where to? We are in Hyderabad now, must reach tomorrow morning only. Stop boy! - Uncle Butchaiah. My foot! You left after talking big. Why did you come back shamelessly? It's a long tale. - Tell me. You'll get bored to repeat again. - Say it interestingly. Bride's mother is dead! Marriage canopy turned into a mourning place! Don't miss it. - Stop your ads. You wanted to say it interestingly. You should stay back and console the bereaved family, why did you come back immediately? They are mourning and we didn't want to be a burden to them. Are you friends? Do you know what is friendship? Did you have food? - Asked it perfectly for the first time. We are hungry. - Come... Where's everyone? I don't see anyone here. This temple is very famous. - Is it uncle? Uncle! Who is he? He didn't respond to your greeting. He's his father. What are you saying? Yes, I lost my parents when I was a kid, I and Viswa were friends, his father took care of me like his own son, Viswa's father fixed a marriage for him, Viswa told me a day before marriage about his love, and his father will not accept it, I arranged his marriage with his lover overnight, unable to bear this shock Viswa's mother died, ever since then he hates me, he's angry on his son. What are you searching? - For you only... for you only... Really? Cut... Your shirt is great. This is the worst shirt I have. Okay... shall we play cricket? I'm half ticket, I don't play with black tickets. What the hell you're talking without respecting elders? He risked his life to save you from kidnappers. When? - In first half. Bond, you may go. Nandhini is watching T20 match in the penthouse, I don't think she'll come out now. She's mad about cricket. Did she come all the way here to watch cricket? If she stays upstairs, what will be my position? Buddy, please do something. Okay, you want her to come out, right? If you cut the cable wire, she'll come out. Chance of watching it on Internet. No use in biting nails. I think better to go up climbing the pipe. You're great buddy! Go up! Should I? You're the hero in story and we should take risk in live? No way, you go. Do I've to buddy? Buddy, I'm climbing. - Go ahead. Did you ask about store room on arrival? Is it for this? I brought 20 cases of liquor, where should I store it? They are having a blast, but my position is... Okay, enjoy it. Watch now! Did you've food, Prabha? - I had, uncle. I had, uncle. Did you eat? Then okay. Are you having drinks, uncle? What's this uncle? This is our fate. I got it, all are drunk. How come TV is running here and not in my room? That is also fate. Not fate... Come here. Come. I thought of you while cutting cable wire to Nandhini's room. Dad, please don't ruin my life. You used to cut cable wire if you didn't like your mother watching soaps. Please don't say anything, dad. Will you please come out for a moment? Go and talk to her. - Father. I've been watching you since I came, you're torturing me. Why did you cut the cable wire? Who told you I cut the wire? You were standing there little while ago, right? Crow was also there, crow could've done it. What am I blabbering? You were behaving over when I came out. It means you'd have cut it. Me? Cutting it? I'll never behave so cheaply. Look, how cheap he's behaving. It's waste to talk to you. Don't ever try to cross my path again. Father! Why? Look, how proud! Very arrogant! Any little brother with a beautiful sister will be. Uncle! Did you have food? - I had. Bond did eat. - Didn't eat? Why are you playing without having food? Uncle, I swear I ate. - No, you must eat now. Eat well and then play. This revenge is okay, what about your love? Days are passing quickly. Just 8 more days. Watch out, I'll flatter her in 5 days. Impossible... you must come. You're coming, that's all. Who is it? - My son. He finished studies in Australia and now training in Vizag, I told him to come here, he says no time to come. Give me the phone. Why are you refusing to come? Ask him to come. I'm Viswa uncle. The same uncle. Rishi, I like you very much, because none of my friend's children is as educated as you. You know Nandhini. Right? She won a gold medal in London Cambridge University. She's a gold medalist and you made her a chocolate thief. To enhance my character I downgraded her character. Do you've to downgrade so much? You can come, can't you? Appala Naidu's son Rishi, studied in Australia, he's presently training in Vizag but refusing to come here. You please ask him to come. I won't take a no. I'm terribly bored here. You must come without fail. I think Nandhini is teasing you. She's already angry on me and who is this Rishi? I'll tell you, give me a cigarette. I know why you're jealous, why are you getting tensed? The new arrival's name is Rishi, name is very stylish, but whose son he is? Would Appy have a son like Hrithik Roshan? He'll be like Appy only! Sorry buddies! That's your bad habit. My sister loves Switzerland, if anyone talks about Swiss, she'll get charmed. If anyone talks about India or Andhra, she'll get angry. Stop. What is he man? I had great thoughts about Nandhini, but he says something else. Unwittingly this boy has given us the full information. You must praise Swiss so that Nandhini overhears it. Me? - Can't avoid it. We don't have much time. Impressing her is more important. You prepare the speech, we'll arrange the gang. Come on boys. Those black tickets think I'm a half ticket. My sister hates Switzerland. Do you know how beautiful Switzerland is! Even offices here not as neat as the roads there. Here only an AC will cool the rooms, but there entire country is cool. Roads, houses and rooms are congested here, but in Swiss, broad roads, big houses, what do we have here that's comfortable? If I've another life, I would like to be born in Swiss. Flow is correct, right? What do you know about India to say like this? What's here to live comfortably? There's love between humans here. That's enough to live the life happily till end without any riches. Though homes are congested, people don't feel it. They feel they are living closer. Though not related they sacrifice for other's sake. Though blood related there, nobody cares for their own also. I understood what I missed till now after coming here. The love and affection showered on us in these few days, I feel like being born again and again here only. ~ Digital Desi Releasers ~ Why? Why do you take so much time to tell your choice? Don't handcuff me... I must make it to your heart today... Please listen to my heart... Don't hide your feelings... Seen you as a woman of substance, don't mask yourself with silence... Come... come... running, O my dear... Take chances and risk without any more fear... Growing amidst clouds... Is that why moon spreads cool moonlight? We blossomed amidst thorns... Even my petals will hurt you... Shore may change but not the attitude... Our lives will never change... Express it and then go... It's not love if you hide it in your heart... It's not sin to share nectar of love... Bliss of love is never a burden... Won't your beauty make an open invitation? Nandhini said she hates you, why are you still here? Let's go back to Hyderabad. Now I've real hope. Nandhini is just like I had imagined. Watch out now, how easily I'll flatter her. Impossible. - Who is that? My sister never plays shuttle. She loves basketball. You know? No. To hell with you. Who cares if your sister likes basketball or not, are you giving misinformation, like fools if we get a basketball court ready, are you planning to play there? Get lost! Why are you staring? Go away! Why are you laughing? Those front benchers think I'm a half ticket. My sister loves basketball. Get ready a basketball ground. To hell with that kid, he's giving misinformation. He's too smart kid. Basketball is correct. Where are you going? They are playing basket ball there. I'm going to watch it. Your plan has worked out. Appy's boy! Are you such a good basketball player? Would Appy have a son like Hrithik Roshan? He'll be like Appy only! Had food kids? Uncle, don't turn me into a killer. - What's he blabbering? Would anyone become a killer by eating food? Why are you torturing us, uncle? Would we die if we skip a meal? Don't anyone bother about us? Rishi may be tall and handsome, so what... What happened to him suddenly? He'll be normal after eating. - Then come with me. If you don't eat you'll have problems, that's why I always ask, had food? Rishi is a good in martial arts too as in studies. He'll now break this ice bar. See, how Nandhini is impressed. You too break the ice bar. It's martial art, you must break it with technique, if not it'll break your hand. You're not talking like a hero. Hero isn'tjust brawn, he needs brain too. He's wantonly targetting you, buddy. Breaking ice again is bore. Why would he use the same? I've ordered for another one. Bring it boys. Come son. Father, you wait. - What's this uncle? If he too tries, we'll know who has more strength. Strength is not something to exhibit, it'll come out when it's necessary. You come son. - Father, you move aside. Start the music, Bunty, you dance. Father, I must break it today. Come... come... son. I'm telling you. How can I father? Don't get emotional son. I know very well about you. What great thing did you do to sing happily? Nandhini will leave in a couple of days, you're not tensed as much as we are. No need to get tensed, if I talk to her for half hour, I can flatter her. You must first talk to her to do it. I can talk only if I get her alone. Even if you get, she doesn't have good impression about you. I'll make a good impression. - How? See inside. Waterfalls is 60 kms away from here, get ready quickly. Your batting is better than bowling. You four kidnap Bond using masks, I'll put him on rocks, I'll join the group silently, finding Bond missing, everyone starts searching for him, I'll take Nandhini and show her Bond in the rocks. Nandhini will hug Bond on seeing him, with tear filled eyes she'll say I'm indebted you all my life. I'll handover Bond to the family, I'll take Nandhini alone and flatter her with my sweet talk. How is it? I think I'll become a director. - You will. Your brother-in-law's horoscope hasn't changed, got kidnapped in story then and now in real too. That's his fate. - Come sister. I told you I'll not come. Come sister, it seems the waterfalls will be very beautiful. This is nothing, I've seen Niagara falls four times. Come on sister. - Plan misfired already. This is also for our good only. I'll stay back and work out something, you carry on. - Today also same buffoon's dress. My fate. - You don't know about youth. Why are you still here? We are getting late. I'm not coming father. You made this plan. Why are you refusing now? You go... go... Aren't you coming? Nandhini come quickly, we are getting late. She'll not come. - Wait, I'm coming. Come sister, it seems the waterfalls will be very beautiful. This is nothing, I've seen Niagara falls four times. Please come sister. - I told you I'll not come. Aren't you joining us, brothers? Waterfalls will be very beautiful. You carry on, we are afraid of water. You come in Rishi's car, this car is full. Your father is villain to you. Aren't you guys going? - How can we without you? Saved for now. Plan to go there. What do you call a chocolate in Telugu? Sweet tuber. - Silly! 'Chocaletu' Enough of having bath, come down. Open the bottle first. - I'll do it. Get me that. Where are the bottles? What a body! Go boys! Why are you massaging here? You'll pay Rs.5 only, he promised to pay Rs.100. How dare you want Rs.100? Why are you beating a kid? - Who are you to stop me? Who am I? - Why are you going overboard? Go away! - How dare you hit me! How dare you hit me! - Stop boys! What man? Go... go away! He's here, come on boys. Come out, acting smart before a girl. Come out. - Come on show your power now. I beg you please... leave him. What are you looking at? Lion is there! Are you fine, dad? - Didn't get hurt... Uncle, you were right. Strength isn't for exhibition, it'll come out when it's necessary. ~ Digital Desi Releasers ~ O my mischief girl, my golden girl, I'm all at sea because of you... O my mischief boy, my golden boy, I'm all at sea because of you... I followed you... I saw your beauty... I fell for your grace, O girl... I gave my heart to you... I made you say it... I gave dreams to your eyes... I've started to like you... Great, you're mine... Great, you're my biggest dowry... Great, I'm yours... Great, I'm your biggest dowry... Hey girl!

Your invitation is exciting my nerves and you've taken over me, O my dear... But he's getting the sympathy. What's this twist? Is it painful son? I think his pain will ease in the store room. Why to store room? - For medicines. For bigger twist, look there! How are you? Why did you come here? How did you come here? You've come suddenly? I brought her, met her in the temple. She's here on excursion. She was speaking fluently in English, So I liked her very much and brought her home. It seems she's yourjunior, she told me on the way. Your mother would've brought her dad too if he speaks in English. Daddy told me everything. This is different Nandhini. Nisha come, I'll introduce you to my people. Mother! - What? Nothing, go... go. Hey! We are in for trouble. What happened? - What if Nisha meets Nandhini? I told her this Nandhini is different from that Nandhini. You dimwit, what if she says she's from Switzerland. - Go! Where is Nisha? - I introduced her to Nandhini. They are talking. - What happened to him? Why did you lie to me? Please have coffee. - I'm leaving aunty. She knows the truth, her father will kill us. Prabha, come in for a moment. I want to talk to you. Come whatsoever it may, face it, go. Go! Who is she? Is she close to you? My junior... why? What actually had happened was... I expected this. Prabha lied to me, rascal. What did you say now? I'm little busy. You gossip with aunty, I'll come after sometime. I was chatting with my friend, I think she left in anger. You mean didn't hear anything she told you. Didn't hear, right? Good job! She's a sticky girl, big bore. You called me for that, right? That's it? That's all, right? Nandhini didn't hear anything Nisha told her. Even if she hears nothing much to lose. - Why? We forgot, today is the last day. Tonight all are leaving. I found a good son-in-law in this trip, I like Rishi very much. Why are you delaying it? We are leaving tonight. Let's ask Nandhini's opinion, come. Whatever may happen, today I'll express my love to Nandhini. You tell her. - You tell her. You tell her. - You tell her. I want to tell you something very important. Where is Prabha, uncle? - Why? Nothing, I'll come back in a minute. Brother, come here. I'm already tensed, please leave me. I'm more tense than you. It's about my life, brother. Only you can solve it. That's why I'm telling you. What happened? I love a man known as Prakash, he called me last night, he got a job in Australia, Rs.1 lakh salary, will be joining in 10 days, and wants to take me along with him as his wife. You're lucky. You want your dad's approval, right? That's not the issue, Prakash's parents are money minded people, he says his parents will respect me only if I take Rs.50 lakh dowry. That's why... Does he love you or the dowry? Think practically, brother. If I go with dowry, I'll be respected and live happily. That's why I'm convinced. How can you be so selfish in love? Uncle struggled a lot to send you to college, how can he get money suddenly to marry you off. That's what I'm also asking, without bothering about grown up daughter's future, he lost heavily in different business deals, nothing is left except this house, tell my father to sell this house and conduct my marriage, brother. Do you know what you're saying? If uncle sells this house, where will he stay? There's no other way than to sell this house for my marriage, why not sell it now? If I miss this chance, I may not get a better choice. If I ask him, he'll say it's ancestral property and shouldn't sell it. He loves you very much, that's why I'm asking your help. Please brother, convince my father. Okay, I'll talk to him. Uncle, I've an important thing to discuss with you. I'm discussing important... - Come I say. Get up. What's so important thing? A friend of mine Prakash, very good boy, he works in Australia, how much you think his salary is? Rs.1 lakh a month. He's planning to marry and leave in 10 days. Very good match to Prasanna, can I talk to them, uncle? How responsible you're on your sister! Since you say he's a good boy, I don't have any doubt about this proposal, but they are asking Rs.50 lakhs as dowry, uncle. Rs.50 lakhs? Then, let's sell this house. What's this uncle? You love this house, right? May be but it's a good proposal. Nothing is more important to me than my daughter's life. Let's sell this house and conduct Prasanna's marriage. But please keep it secret from Prasanna. - Why uncle? She may not let me sell this house because I love it. Moreover she may not agree to marry and leave me in 10 days. Why will she not agree? I'll make her accept. You don't say a word. I'll make her say yes. Come. Uncle and I've fixed a match for you, his name is Prakash, he works in Australia with Rs.1 lakh salary. He's my close friend. Very good proposal. I'm refusing it wholeheartedly, brother. I don't want this marriage. Please agree dear, if we miss this, we may not get a better choice. That's a father! Father... father... - Calm down dear. Please don't cry. Calm down dear. As a girl you've to marry and leave. Calm down dear. Did you see how she's crying on talking about marriage? I don't want this marriage, father. - It's wrong. - Don't say like that. We've decided, this marriage must happen. I said no, I don't want this marriage. It's wrong, you mustn't say like that. This marriage will happen, it must. What's this? - I said no. She's refusing marriage, why are you forcing her? Father... This marriage must happen. This marriage must happen. - You know that boy? You know. I know him. He's very smart. What great Australia? Is he good match to Prasanna or not? Infact he was born for Prasanna only. But a small problem. - What's it? They are asking Rs.50 lakhs as dowry, uncle wants to sell this house. This house! Will you sell this house? Prasanna is like a daughter to me also. I too have made little money. I'll bear all the marriage expenses. I'll take care of the gifts. We are not here to share only happiness, allow us to share your difficulties too. I too made good money in Swiss, I'll take care of the dowry. Prabha, come here. - Tell me. Call him. There's a problem, marriage must happen within 10 days, because the groom is leaving to Australia. Within 10 days? Okay, let's go from here after conducting her marriage. I too got the same idea. I didn't know you all love me so much. Love can't be said in words, it must be shown in deeds. You! I'll ensure that every guest enjoys feast and leaves. How many more days? ~ Digital Desi Releasers ~ My life... you swelled like sea today... Doused my heart with your golden rain... What did you say with your eyes? You've tied me with your breath... I'm experiencing happiness today which I never felt earlier... Though young and old are watching, I think your game will not stop... You made pushed the distance away between us... Heart is thrilled with turn... Have those days of silly fights come back? Happiness is doubling up... It has become my most cherished memories... She's mine in this life and in any life on this earth... I can't tolerate Prabha any more. Nandhini is always after him. I don't know what to do with him. Just say yes, I'll kill him. No, we must plan something else. Everyone hits 4's and 6's, but never give me chance to bat. What? - Come here. You're always with them only, we too are your friends. Sit with us. - Tell me what's it? A girl came for Prabha, who is she? She is... - Is she Prabha's lover? No, she tried him. Her father is a big Don. He threatened Prabha to marry her. But Prabha narrated a story that he loves Nandhini and escaped. What's that Don's name? - Just now got a bottle. Tell his name. - Had food? You go, we'll join later. Why is he having seizures? He'll not be well till he eats. - He'll die without food. Uncle, listen... I want Nandhini. - That's all! Leave it on me. Come here. Put this thread into the needle. Needle... thread... - I'm calling you only! Coming! Don't shout. Where did I keep my cell phone? Why did he leave iron box switched on? He's always like this. What happened? Don't touch that iron box. It's giving electric shocks. Hey stop! Stop I say! Rishi, he's beating me. - Stop! Why are you beating him? You don't know. - What should I know? Have you gone mad? What if anything had happened to you? Shut up! Say sorry to him first. - Father! Without knowing what had happened, you're asking me to say sorry. Say sorry. Why are you beating a grown up son for trivial thing? Is beating me and my friends trivial thing to you? Either I must be here or he must be here. Why are you over reacting? Get out. You stop. What he did was mistake. I'll send him out from here. You please don't go. You go away. Why are you asking him to leave? You're drunk, go away. I'm not drunk, listen to me. If you don't go now, it's a promise on our friendship. Why are you still standing here? Go! Do you know what you're doing? What's all this? I fear his presence may spoil our 30 years friendship. No need to be so harsh dad, I'll go away. What happened, father? Please listen to me. Nobody must utter a word, all of you go in. I'm sorry uncle, I didn't beat Rishi for nothing. Please forgive me. You must forgive me. He's not my son at all. Your father promised on our friendship, so I stopped. If not I would've told them. I said he's my son since your father told me to say so. I too don't know why. I'm leaving father. Till now I thought I was your world. No father, you've another world. Who is Rishi, father? Isn't he asking you? Answer him. He'll not tell you, I'll tell you. Allow me. Elderly man who didn't talk to your father for 20 years called him home. You allowed me to come home, I'm happy. If you say you've forgiven me, it'll give me peace of mind. Let bygones be bygones, the future is in your hands. What are you saying? We met in temple, right? My son saw Viswa's daughter, he wants to marry her only, father too agreed to this because grandson is adamant. Greetings uncle. Sit here. Unable to ask Viswa, father called you here. You must conduct this marriage. I'll give my life also to conduct this marriage. Why did you do like this? - What happened now? I don't have any objection. My father who never accepted my love, that family which didn't even come to console when my wife died, Nandhini hates them. Nandhini will not agree to this marriage. Let's do one thing. We're staying here for 10 days, let introduce Rishi as Appala Naidu's son to Nandhini. Both are well educated, they will get on well easily. Let them come to an understanding, let's ask Nandhini and get her acceptance. You and your father must unite. Seeing you getting close to Nandhini, fearing he may break the given promise, he's asking you to leave. Is that all the matter? Do you need all that drama? It's true I love Nandhini. But never proposed to her. She too doesn't have any feelings for me. So there's nothing for you to fear or for me to feel sad. You're important to me, dad. You're my hero. I'll do anything for you. Forget all this and come back happily after conducting the marriage. Mother, take care of dad. You failed to understand your son, right? What do you want me to do? Are you leaving? Sister. - Found it? Not yet sister. - Search properly. - Okay. A small help please, I've lost my dollar, I love it, please find it for me. You say it's your life, where will it go? Search it properly, it'll be with you only. Your dance was great. You too can dance well. But as good as you did. - Don't worry, I'll teach you. How can you teach me? I'm going away to Switzerland. Will you forget me after going to Switzerland? I may forget anyone but not you. - I know it. I made this for you. Take it. How is it? - Great. I love it. I searched, but didn't find it. Did you find it? Didn't find it. Stop! Didn't you find it really? - No. Why are you lying? I saw you putting it into your pocket. I put it there so that you'll see it. Didn't get me? Infact I'm here for you only, Prabha. When I met you at the railway gate, the happiness on your face was similar to what I saw as on your face years ago. I understood I'm still in your heart. But I wanted to know how much you love me. That's why I behaved as if I don't like you. Every try you made doubled the love I've for you. No girl ever had this luck, I love you and you love me, and make you love me more. I can't take it anymore. What are you thinking? Come here. Your grandfather, your paternal aunt, uncle. Keep the sickles inside. Why did you make me a fool with your story? But still you're lucky. My daughter still loves you. Though I lied to you, I love Nandhini. Who is she? Forget her. Come. Bloody! Then die! Don't come near me. What are you doing? - Father! You may feel sad and shed few tears. But the pain is mine. If you force a marriage for your selfishness, I must go through the pain all my life. What are you trying to say? I'm not able to get it. I love Prabha. Don't be in haste. Prabha doesn't love you and will never love you. Prabha loves me, right? No. Why are you lying? Nisha told me everything. I heard everything. Father, you always told me how much you loved mother, Prabha loves me more than you. I failed to understand you. - I promised your father. My foot! Till now never bothered about us if we are alive or dead, now his grandson likes her, will he come forgetting the past to unite with us? If I didn't have a daughter, would he be here? Though you went them like a dog for 20 long years to forgive you, he didn't forgive you, but you helped my love, and got punished for 20 years, that's why you're more important to me than my father, you're important. My daughter's life is important who loves your son. I don't care about anyone, your son is my son-in-law. Your son is pure gold. No, I don't want to be again... There's substance in his decision. I know what was my mistake all these days. My ego stopped me from accepting it before my son. I didn't come to you for this marriage only, I wanted to come to you, honour your friendship, and get my grandson married to her. Why is Nandhini coming here? You're refusing to marry my daughter because of her, right? You told me a story that she had met with an accident. I'll make the story come true. She mustn't live. Go away! Start the vehicles. Go away. I beg you, please don't harm Prabha. I love him. You can take my life. Please don't harm him. I can't live without him. Darling! He won't harm us. Look there! He loves our love story, isn't it sir? He'll not harm us, come.
