Everything was almost stationary. There was water and a boat. And then someone was pouring gasoline. "Essential beauty", I thought. I was so tired. I thought "Nature contains many mysteries". I couldn't sleep. It was hard for me to see. All the details were strange, strange shapes to me. A boat was going into the water. Various occurrences. And the boat began to move. There was someone in the boat. - We're gonna try to go fast enough to go into the night. I saw drops of water and it was very bright. I was moving. All of a sudden it was dark. I was moving very fast. I saw the light of the moon reflecting in the moving water. And I heard the man say something. I felt so tired and I was moving so fast. I think I went to sleep and I wanna to tell you... - It worked. ...that I dreamed of you.
