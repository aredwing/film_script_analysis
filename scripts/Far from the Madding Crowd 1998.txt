I think it has a Casterbridge boyfriend! - Do you know his name, Maryann? - No, miss. - Patron. - What are you doing? Nothing, ma'am. Moving sacks. - It's stealing the barley! - No, employer ... How dare you? Out! Out! You must return to the hacienda soon! The landlady is mad! Fanny Robin has gone! And the foreman has taken for stealing the barley! I knew it! I knew I was a thief. The question is: Who will be the foreman now? Not you, that's for sure. Fanny Robin is gone. Do you know where can she be? Excuse me, miss. "There was a young soldier that was courting? You're right. It's what we hear. Jan Coggan, go to investigate the villages. Billy Smallbury, go to Casterbridge. Try to find out who this man and if Fanny went to look. Yes, ma'am. Come on. All. Vamos! Why has it become a pastor? What happened to your finances? I lost it. How? I was unlucky. Sorry to hear it. You better keep between us we know. I had no intention of telling anyone, Bathsheba.

Mr. Boldwood wants to see Miss. I can not receive in this state. Tell which is full of dust and can not lose. Tell him I can not see him. That will do, Mrs. Coggan. Ms. Everdene can not receive, sir. Is full of dust and is not presentable, that's what it says. Just wanted to ask if you knew anything about Fanny Robin. Not yet. But Billy Smallbury Casterbridge was to get her. So do not bother more. Who is Mr. Boldwood? Um Mr Laird, the Little Weatherbury ranch. Why asked Fanny? - Well, boss, when Fanny ... - Sorry, Maryann! I think the landlady me was asking me! Fanny lost her family as a child. Then Mr. Boldwood the put in school and to work with his uncle. - That's very nice. - Seen this way, yes, Miss But God help us! A man a desperate woman! - Are not you married? - All young people here have courted. Mary Stockton was behind for one year. The daughter of the planter Ives spent more than 20 pounds in clothes. It would have been better had thrown the money into the river, because Mr. Boldwood never noticed. - I have a penny! - Where did you get it, Teddy Coggan? Mr. Boldwood gave it to me. I opened the door and said: "The new boss is an older woman, is not it? " And I said yes. Teddy, strip inside! Excuse me, miss. Sam ... Still no news on Fanny Robin. We'd better prepararmos to drain the swamp of Newmill. Yes, sir. Adam! George! Come on! Boys! Vamos! Vamos! You never have asked to marry Miss? Many, I imagine. A man once asked me. But it was not appropriate for me. What a pleasure to be able to refuse! Kiss my feet, sir, My face is important for men. Do you love her, miss? No. But I liked it. And yet you like? Of course not. The boys are coming. May reduce the wages to 8 shillings. The landowner pays us only 8 Ives. It could drive us all! And where would you go? I've lived my whole life in this town! Who will be appointed overseer? That is the question! It's my turn. If you say so, Henry. Is it Fanny? I think it's the sheep We Lost Christmas, sir. Leave it, Sam. Then start on that side. I dare not look at her face of so shy I am. Cheer up, Joseph. Everything will be fine. - Any news of Fanny? - No, miss. No one has seen. Well, let's begin. Joseph Poorgrass, are you here? I am Poorgrass, "sir." Speak up, can not hear you. What is your work on the farm, Joseph?

Exactly. Y. .. takes 10 shillings. A small gift since it just arrived. - Thank you, ma'am. - It's more than a week's wages! The new pastor will need someone to help you. Who could it be? Young Cain Ball is a good boy if the pastor does not Oak regardless of their youth. I do not care. Okay, Cain Ball orders will be pastor. Do you know what your tasks, pastor Oak? I think so, Miss Everdene. Temperance and Soberness Miller. "Both are women? - Yes, we are here. - We believe. What have they been doing? Plow, sow, break the hard ground.

You will not find a better pair! - Sit! - Me, Miss? Return to your place! Well done! You lost your chance, Henry! What? To be brief, Miss, Fanny Robin has run away with the soldiers. - It's a sensible girl, right? - Yes, ma'am. A wise girl. The boy is 11 th Regiment of Dragoons. Melchester have gone to. I told her to follow them. - How do you call that man? - I have not discovered, miss. But I think it has more category a soldier. Cain Ball, you'd better not tell the landowner Boldwood. Yes, mistress. Now that most of you are present ... Last night, I surprised the foreman Pennyways stealing barley from the barn. I thought about reporting it, but changed my mind. And I will not appoint another foreman. I'm going to manage all by myself. Still do not know my talent for agriculture, but I'll do my best. And if you serve me well, I will repay in kind. And lest anyone think that being a woman, I do not know the difference between a good or bad business. I will arise before that you wake up. I'll be on the field before you will rise.

I like to come to headquarters, women are indecent. I'll go tomorrow. Good night, Fan. Good night, Frank. Good night. Damn! What do you want? Who the hell is it? Must be a landowner! Bring a sack of grain sample. But where have we come? Allow women to come here! What audacity to come here! An indiscretion, that's what it is! Well? I'm afraid, miss, all you can do with it is give to the pigs. The most I can offer is ... 30 shillings a quarter pound. I'm doing you a favor taking it out of hand. Then the pigs will to find another food, right? This grain is worth 62 shillings and will not sell for less. - Who is this woman? - The niece of Mr. Everdene. Unable to display tenderness before men, Fan. I would throw the barracks. Come here. You know that only I have eyes for you. - Really? - There is no other. When you said that we would get married, Are you serious? Sure. I know I'm not ... I just want you sure what to do. - If you have a better idea ... - Do not be silly, Frank.

No. His bank is in opposite of yours, miss. He was not looking. Well, what did? Not even once turned to look at throughout the mass. Why should I? Did not ask. All others are set on you They say a woman rejected as a young man and why it's so quiet. People always say that. Guess is nature be reserved and indifferent to everything. Yes, ma'am. Rich and gentlemanly, "He who cares? Who is that? Mr. Boldwood Why? No. It's for little Teddy Coggan. I want to give a pleasant surprise. What type? "Roses are red, violets blue, Honey is as sweet as you are. " That would be fun send it to the old Boldwood! How many rounds would give! - No, do not understand grace. - I can imagine your face! He would die of worry! Let's do lots. Or Boldwood Teddy! Ah, no! On Sunday not can play with money. We will use the book! There can be no sin on him. It is more likely to fall open. So open is Teddy; Boldwood is closed. Patron! Done! Alter the solemnity of a priest. Letter to Mr. Boldwood. - Thanks, Joe. - Sure. Marry me Adam, George, go on preparing the ground of 3 acres. Sam, finished clearing the fields for spring grain and leads a group Durnsey Hill to start plowing. Yes, sir. I think it is for your pastor. My mistake. It is for the pastor of Miss Everdene. No. - No, do not worry. I will take them. - Come on. Liddy! "Mrs. Coggan has already lit the fire in the kitchen? Yes, ma'am. Tell him to burn it, Will you, Liddy? Unless you want any girls.

They say things his uncle and dislikes. We are buying everything new. Resistant chairs for fat people for thin and delicate. - A piano again. - How? What will make a planter with a piano? If all the money wasted his uncle, we will affect us. It is the turn of the head, the movement of the shoulders, Is the challenge of women in general! Hello, neighbors. Is there room for two more? Hey, shepherd! Sit by the fire. What happened? We were talking about strange behavior of the patron. And what have you been saying about her? These old men were putting green.

We are concerned as workers. If you lose the farm, What will become of us? Has no knowledge agriculture and has no foreman. I do not know that defends pastor. I should have named his foreman. Is right for the job. What? Ms. Everdene entitled to be his own overseer and to stay as pastor, if desired. - Boldwood. - Good morning, Mr. Boldwood. Oak. Oak, I'm afraid I opened unread by the recipient. I apologize for my error. Apology accepted, Mr. Boldwood. - It's Fanny Robin. - Fanny? Thank God! Do not know I knew her. Actually, no. I found the night I arrived and gave him a shilling. He says he will marry with a certain Sergeant Troy the 11 th Regiment of Dragoons. Oh, Fanny Foolish girl! - Why? Do you know that Troy? - It is in this region. He says he is a nobleman. Yes, it is said to be the son illegitimate one Lord. It's pretty smart, but when it comes to women ...

But I can not say. You better say it, or will put your head in cow dung. He sent a card Valentine's Day! - What Boldwood? - No way! It was just a joke. Not interested in it. It's incredible. Have you been losing the head Boldwood a Valentine's card? Continues, Liddy. What else do you know? Is it going to marry him? Not want to marry anyone. Is very busy being his own boss. It should not with everything he has. Then it comes up. All women do. Except you, Maryann. Well, not that I did not try. Can we consider Miss Everdene ... beautiful? Very beautiful, indeed, sir. Attracted much attention when came here, if you remember. - This will make you stand out enough. - It's so nice! You do not want to take a cold in the church. Oh, sorry. Come here. I'm so nervous. Come on, you will be proud of yourself. You will be a lovely bride. The Mass was over, Sgt. - Sergeant Troy? - Yes - Are there any witnesses? - No. Want to witness a wedding? And you? - Was not there a wedding today? - No. Go to hell! Frank! Frank! He believed that the Church of All Santos was the bell. I arrived there at half past eleven as you said, and the priest told me I was wrong. I did not worry too much, I thought why we could get married tomorrow. Silly! But it was a mistake! Are we going tomorrow, Frank? Damn you! I will not do so fast. - But, Frank ... When? - God knows when! Marry me. Marry me. Marry me. Marry me .... Miss Everdene. This is not eating, Mr Oak.

I am sorry, mistress. Good morning, Mr. Boldwood. - Have you been looking? - Good morning, Mr. Boldwood. Good morning, Miss Everdene. Mr. Boldwood. Miss Everdene! Good morning. I feel I have much on its mind. My life is not the same since I looked good on you. I never saw her husband. Even when I was young. But now, seeing her, I feel that my lifestyle is bad, in all respects. I came to make a proposal marriage, Miss Everdene. Mr. Boldwood, I ... I respect him a lot, but I can not marry you. But ... Valentine's letter! It was a joke should not have sent it. Do not say it was a joke. I can not accept. Mr. Boldwood, I ... I'm sorry. But you awakened something in me. I love her. I want ... let me tell you I love her, again and again. Mr Boldwood, no, please! I can not stand feel so much ... when I feel nothing. I'm too old Cree and sad but will change, Ms. Everdene. You will notice that we have gone. Not imagine I would say those things. I am a miserable for making him suffer like that. So do not tell me definitely is rejecting me. Do not love you, Mr. Boldwood. I tell you that. But I can go back talk about this issue? Yes Can I think of you? I guess so. - And hope to conquer? - No. No, do not. Let's go back. - I'll visit tomorrow. - No! - Give me time, Mr. Boldwood. - Yes I'll give anyone who wants. - Now I'm happier. - No. Not satisfied. I need to think. He's gone. He said he would not marry and left. Okay. Did he say where would you go? I had no money. So I do not know what he meant. Thanks. Cain, go to the meadow below and bring the horse chestnut. I turned the crank. I need to talk to you, Gabriel. Do workers have said something about me being in the forest with Mr. Boldwood, yesterday? Ah, yes. Turn you, Gabriel. My head is spinning. No. It holds well. I'll show. Tilt the blade so. Let go of my hand ... please. What did they say? To be married before the end of the year. Well, that's nonsense and I want to contradict them. - Okay. So Bathsheba ... - Miss Everdene. If Mr. Boldwood has proposed marriage, I will not lie only because I tell you. I just want to say is not true. I will not marry him. Well, if it is true, I think I can say. May also give my opinion on their behavior. I have not asked your opinion. Only do what I said. And what's wrong in my behavior? It is unworthy of an honest woman. Did not like my bluntness, eh? Absolutely. I have you in such low regard, will not even consider. And exactly what I was unworthy? Maybe not to marry you? Absolutely. Long ago I stopped thinking about it. And to desire it, I guess. And also if desired. Bathsheba! You have been a senseless. Bringing hope Mr. Boldwood, if you're interested, is not well. He himself who cares, You should have made known in a more dignified to send a stupid letter Valentine's Day. How dare you talk like that? You pay your damn salary. You'll go. Abandon the hacienda When the week is over. I'm going now, if you prefer. Go now, then. I never want to see anymore! Patron, Mrs. Coggan says that there is no beef and asked if I could be calf. Do not bother me with the damn meat! - Sheep, patron! Sheep! - Sheep! - 60! 70! - 59! They have broken the fence! Entered in a field of youth clubs, young lady. It started to swell! And die nit if not cure. Idiots! Come to find me and not go directly to them! When eating clubs ... his stomach was swollen. It is a horrible and painful death. Cast out from here that still are well, fast. Come on, guys. What I can do? What I can do? The sheep are so unfortunate! Whenever something bad happens. - There is only one way to save them, miss. - What? We have to make a hole in one side with a special instrument. Can you do it? "I can do? If you are wrong by an inch, puncturing the stomach and the sheep will die. Only one man you know it. Who? Do it coming! The pastor Oak. The Oak pastor no longer works for me. The landowner Boldwood know what to do. No, mistress. He commands call the pastor Oak. You need a vacuum tube, with a sharp punch inside. - Yeah, right. - Yes, that is the instrument. Do not stand idly by while the sheep are dying! Go and find someone who can save them! Vamos! Quick! Who wants to go to find, unless you want to Oak? Do not know. Just do see you'll find someone. Do not send for him. No. Mark Clark! Bring Oak. Take the horse. Tell him to come then, I ask him. Well? Hunger said that good no bread, lady. What? He says he will not unless requested to do correctly, as any woman who asks a favor. Where does he get those damn air?! Lose the whole flock. I'll be ruined. Why does not ask him more delicately, Miss? Sure and come. Gabriel is a gentleman in that regard. Mark ... come home. "Do not desert me, Gabriel" Will you stay here with me, Gabriel? Where do you go for your license, Troy? Do women in the city? Again I Weatherbury, to help harvest the hay. "Harvest of hay? It's a job a little humble, to a nobleman. What do you know of nobility? I do it every year. Then you go for women in the field. Give it up, Dobbs, is a good boy. "That girl did not leave you at the altar? Do not continue to think on it? - Yes? - Seeking job, sir. Are the field, right? Your turn will be 6 am to 10 pm. The salary is 5 shillings a week. It's not like farm work. Are you sure that you? - Yes, sir. - Okay. You have to mark it. Can end up in another farm or not. Yes, ma'am. Cain! Blush insult. Good job, Gabriel. Well done and quickly. - Cain Ball? - Yes, Mr. Oak, I'm here. Soft like the wings of an angel. Good morning, Miss Everdene. Mr. Boldwood. I do not think you can. I'm busy here. You can leave them alone, do this for years. I'll see the new flock Mr. Boldwood Leicester. My place, Gabriel. Keep all working. If that does not mean marriage ... She will have less to say, when she marries. A man put in place. Do not understand why a young lady must have a husband, when you're brave enough to fight their battles, and does not need a house. It eliminates the opportunity for another woman. Yes, a woman like me. I do not think you have many Boldwood possibilities, Maryann. I thought that no woman would have them. But I think the kiss in the woods the other day. It's a lie! Not marry him. Ah, Oak neighbor! How do you know? Why do not you turn to work? I have reason to believe I already knew our patron before, pastor. I do not think anyone else knows. Not that I'm sure. I knew her before, when I was somebody. I have not always been who I am today. Did she do you care? More than my life, Jan. She does not like Boldwood. I know not. But she has it all, and I ... I'm just a pastor. That's the way, Gabriel. I promised that I would not tell anyone. I will be a tomb. Depart from my feet! Do you think there will be enough meat for all, Mrs. Coggan? There will be enough to feed a regiment, miss. I do not want to disappoint anyone. I know how my uncle did these things well. Do I sit here? Gabriel, you want to sit to the other side and assume the task of that part? Then, brewmaster, How old are you? The pastor would like to know the story of his life. May the Lord help us! We're here to harvest! Well, not exactly remember the year I was born, but I remember all sites in which I lived. I was born in Longpuddle to 11 years Malta produced for 22 years, and after 22 years at harvest. Then, 3 years Cresscombe, and here I will make 31 years here by fista de la Candelaria. - How old are they? - 117. That is the age that I have! Good afternoon, Miss Everdene. I apologize for the delay. Good afternoon, Mr. Boldwood. Gabriel, do you mind to change you site and leave it to Mr. Boldwood? Thanks, Gabriel. # I lost my love I did not care # Soon I'll have another # To be better than the other. I wonder who will be doing Fanny. I was sitting here Last year at this time. I wonder if there will be found his beloved. And if you have not found, find one you like. No, you should be married If not checked would have gone home, right? No one knows a man more, a hunchback, or some kind of second-hand I help you? I hope I do not expect a perfect one at my age. If I had my beautiful Jane, Maryann, I would choose. What about the old brewmaster? His Rebecca has been dead many years. Do not be silly, need a young man not an old man. Is not it true, Maryann? Come on, Joseph, you If you are a young respectable Maryann is looking for a man. # I have sown, # I have sown, # The seed of love. # And I've planted ... Cros rude! Begone! Go on, Joseph. It was very nice. No, no more song - And make Everdene Miss! - Yes, boss! "You will touch me, if I sing, Gabriel? # On the banks of Allan Water # When the Spring came # The beautiful miller's daughter # It was the most beautiful of all # The summer brought the pain # And a dishonest soldier # On the banks of Allan Water # No one was more unhappy than she. - Very nice. - Good night all. I'll stretch my legs. Come on, guys. I know I'm too old for you, but take care better than any half man younger than me. The will protect and will love with all my strength. Only God knows what it means to me. Try to love him, Mr. Boldwood, but I will not make a promise tonight. I'd rather wait a few weeks. - But he believes that then ... - He was saying he was leaving. I have hopes that when you return to harvest I can promise I'll be your wife. But remember it I have not promised. Enough for me. I ask nothing more. Ah, Mark! Mark. Good night. Excuse me. We have been engaged. Let loose. Sorry, let it go at a time. No, I can do it alone. Is trapped. Allow me. Thanks for letting me watch such a beautiful face. It was against my will. I like for resistance. I have to cut the dress if you hurry. Then do it and move on. - Look at this mess. - What is worse on purpose! Not true. I say yes. And I will. I've seen so many women beautiful in my life I have not seen none as beautiful as you. You can take offense if you like. I do not care. There. Sergeant Troy. I wish it had been impossible to undo a knot. Good night ... precious. Good night ... precious. No! I cut my arm! You are a stupid guy, Cain Ball! Go find your mother, Cain. Is in the field next door. Mother! Mother! Mother! - Good morning, Sergeant. - Good morning everyone. Good morning, Sgt. - Welcome back, Sgt. - Beautiful morning! I'm happy to be alive. We thought we would not this year. I heard that his wife was expecting another baby since the last time I saw you. My wife's affairs not your concern, Sgt. Indeed, Coggan, it's time that teach you how to tie a knot! Good morning, Sergeant Troy. Fanny Robin is not working in the field this year? Fled, left behind a soldier. They say their loved one is in the Regiment of Dragoons. Did you know? I know the man as myself. No other man in the regiment I like more. Is it in the same regiment that you? Who is this woman? It's the new boss, Ms. Everdene. Five minutes after arriving here, dismissed the foreman. Think you can do it alone. What is your name Fanny's lover? No. I can not say. There is a code of honor among the soldiers, you know? Miss Everdene! Good morning! I did not know it was you the other night. I think I was impertinent. I think so. What are you doing on my land? He helped his uncle with hay preparation since childhood. I hope you do not mind to do the same for you. Not sure. I see you still mad at me, because I took the liberty to call beautiful. Do not let strangers they are bold and arrogant. What retirement. Is an ordinary woman and mediocre. What do you think? Could happen to me without saying anything. The pleasure of feeling something is in being able to express at that time. Have done the same if it was ugly. And since when undergoing this afliciccin? Since I was old enough to differentiate the deformity of beauty. - Miss Everdene, do you forgive? - Do not think so. I said I was beautiful and I say again. The most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I can not stay here talking all day. A trader horses arrive at ten. What time is it? - Do not wear a watch? - No. Take mine, is a gift. I can not accept it! Do not be silly! It was my father. Face it, Miss Everdene. I want it to stay. Please come back and get it. Just know you! Why would I the watch of his father? Please. I have my workers been followed throughout the field. Temperance, the young Sergeant not married, right? I do not think it is, Mr. Oak. At least not behave as a married man. Girls ruin decent that's for sure. Trying to give his watch. Yes, and it is not only trying to give. Miss Everdene, good morning. Are you trying to deal bee you alone? Do not have one to help? No, they're all finishing to collect the hay. I'll do it for you. Thanks. You'd better put the veil and gloves, but could bite. Yes, the veil and gloves. And it will be better than the hat too. The hat also missing more. Still warm from your head. Better than what I put you. I am not good at these things. Show some gratitude, please Miss Everdene. It is ridiculous! Hold this swarm with arm more than a week ago exercise with the sword. You've never seen? No. Help me get it off, I'm suffocating. Should display. I do very well. Now? I have no sword now but could get one this afternoon. "Stay with me ... in Blackridge Hollow? Well ... Liddy would have to carry me. I do not see why. I can not find to you alone. Good grief! If just to teach exercised with a sword. One would think that I'm inviting some sort of depravity. Take care of Miss Everdene. Okay, Simeon? If you need help, tell Sam not to hesitate. - Yes, sir. - Return in time for the harvest. Arre! Stand back 60 feet from me ... and stay quiet. If you are afraid, I can not. I have no fear. - "The sword is sharp? - Not at all. So, are you ready? Still as a statue. - It has been ... Amazing! - Wait! You have cut your hair. "As he has done ... with a sword blade? Is sharp as a knife, could cut a man in two. My life has hung by a thread! To be exact, his life hanging by a thread 195 times. Never fails. "I can keep it? We will meet at the foot of Hill, on Sunday afternoon. I can not. This is a horrible job. Oh, what would a girl in a white horse! My life is stagnant the lack of opportunities. I guess you have a myriad suitors. I was getting married, with a soldier. - Are shirking, right? - No, it was my fault. It's better this way. He was a gentleman. I had always thought that would hinder him. You'll find someone else! There are dozens in every corner with his tongue out. - Is this? - Too big. What about that? - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. Could you show some of their rings? - For you, sir? - No, no. For one ... Miss, perhaps? For his wife. It will be. It was the landlady. I was in the forest with a soldier. - I was going to kill her with a sword, and then ... - Teddy! Do not be silly. Gabriel, are you also walk? I thought I should go get it, as the man who should it is far from home. Mr. Boldwood. I do not understand what you mean. Why should I go to fetch Mr. Boldwood? For the wedding, say to be among you. What they say is not true. I did not give any response Mr. Boldwood final. But upon his return, I will. I can not marry him. I wish I had known never Sergeant Troy. It is not good enough for you. I came to beg no more relationship. Sergeant Troy does not concern us. What do you know him? Do you see a honest? Because I do not think has too many scruples. I do not mean it all bad, but it is not fully trusted. I want you out. Do not want you to stay on my ranch, I do not want. Go, eh? What nonsense! How to work the farm? This is the second time intended to say goodbye. What's in that? I am your patron. You'll go. Bathsheba ... You know I love you. And I will love you forever. I mention it only so you know you do not wish any harm. That said, I keep aside. But I beg you to consider. If you care about your reputation as much as me. Be more discreet with that soldier. Gabriel, will you let me now? Not to be ordered as a patron, I ask a woman. You have come. I had no intention of doing so but ... Mr. Oak was looking for him. I found the road. What Oak is about me? I do not fear him or anyone else. - We walk a little. - Just a moment. God, you're beautiful! No. Bathsheba, I absent briefly. It is only to Bath. Do not worry. No, not ... I have other things to think about. - I can not explain. - Ven. Show me a smile before I go. No, no! Sorry. I have not been contained. And I think you either. Dear Mr. Boldwood, now I've had time to reflect, y. .. although I am very flattered his intentions with me, I feel it dishonest and unfair ... He is pointing well above its possibilities, if you expect to get it. Simply pretty face to please. It is a libertine or so they say. Takes advantage Boldwood is absent. It would be better to stay with him. I would like to see Troy in charge of a farm! He has two things and one is under her skirt. I swear by God that you can put under my skirt all you want. Who are you talking about? We were talking about what passes between you and Sergeant Troy. I forbid you to say those things. You know I do not care. We know not, lady. I hate you, is a libertine. It is not a rake! What do I care what it is? Take this to the mail! This is a change. Excuse me for having misunderstood, miss. I thought he liked Sergeant Troy, but now I do not. The people are always saying such nonsense! But if someone says word about it, I will say: "Of course a young woman like Ms. Everdene can not love him. It is unworthy of it. " But, Liddy, do not you understand? I love him dearly. Patron! And Mr. Boldwood? I have gotten into trouble, Liddy. I have written to Mr. Boldwood y. .. I have rejected. Do not worry, miss. Will be out until harvest. Miss Everdene, am I afraid? Mr. Boldwood, good afternoon. I remove the middle. I do not take the middle. I've never done. Do not let me believe, was only hope. That night, at home ... Where did all those kind words? Is your hope of being able to love? Do you really forgotten? You should not have a heart. Bathsheba ... tell me who wrote this negative only as a joke. Tell me. Lie. I have no loving nature you think I have. You have enough affection, but is directed to another and I know who. Why not let Troy my treasure alone? Before his arrival, you have accepted me. - Can you deny it? - No. No! I had it! But I stole it during my absence ... and I took it. Come, marry him! Vamos! Do not talk like that! I'm just a girl! Fascinated by the uniform scarlet and gold braid! It is unworthy of you to attack a woman in this way! I have no one to defend me. But what has ... Has the red dandy. Do you? Has he kissed? The kissed! Holy God has kissed. I would have given all by the touch of your hand. - Then, I will kiss. - No, no, Mr. Boldwood. Do not do it! It is a respectable man, behave as such! - Damn. Damn! - Do not curse him. No! I love him, I can not help it. Bathsheba, forgive me. Excuse me. I have accused you, when he is a sinner. He has stolen my heart with lies y. .. flattery. It is fortunate that there returned to his regiment. Bathsheba, do not let it put me in front ... why could not respond. Oak Lord! Oak Lord! He is responsible for the finances! The boss is gone! It Cain Ball. Goes with their best clothes. He won a day off for having cut his arm. It's true. For a broken leg I read "The Pilgrim's Progress." My father was dislocated arm and had time to go to court. How many times do I have to say do not run while you eat? You choke. I was in Bath ... and vi ... our patron. - Yes, so what? - I was walking. Drink some cider will come in handy. He has risen through the nose! Leave the guy alone. It has a horrible cough. - Somebody give pats on the back. - Yes Now tell us what happened. Come on. I saw our landlady and a soldier ... enter into a kind of park. He put his arm around his waist, and came increasingly as a couple. I think the soldier Troy was Sgt. Now, she will lose his reputation forever. - It is better than a ... - Brother, bite your tongue. They sat down and began to speak looked like a serious issue. The landlady was crying. Desperately! Are you sure it was her? Absolutely. - And then? - I saw nothing of the patron. Why cry if you had no privacy with that man. It does not. I'm sure not. Wait, before you speak. It is not ignorant. It was well-bred, know how to use sweet words. It was his impetuosity that led him to be a soldier. The ladies prefer a sinner. Do not beat yourself up for it, Gabriel. What does it matter who is her lover, it can not be yours? Not for me that I fear, is for her. Patron! He's back! We were concerned, did not know what had happened. Sorry, Liddy. I had no time to explain. But I'm back. Ms. Everdene, Liddy. You might say ... My employer can not welcome, sir. - Good night. - Good evening, Sergeant. "Sergeant Troy? Yes? I am William Boldwood. I like to talk to you. About what? About a woman which deceived. I'm surprised his impertinence. Surprised or not we need to talk. Be the fondness Fanny Robin for you. Is an orphan. Has no one to protect it, except me. - I should marry her. - I suppose so. - I would, but I can not. - Why not? I'm too poor. Troy, I propose a business transaction. Was engaged to Miss Everdene, before the occurrence. - No, they were promised. - Almost. - Maybe you had promised to - To hell with that "maybe"! If it had not appeared, sure he would have accepted. Look, Troy, should know this ... flirt with her, Marriage does not make it. Marry Fanny Robin. It is most appropriate for you. I will make him worthwhile. Oh yeah? I'll give you 50 pounds tonight. Fanny receive 50 pounds to organize the wedding and 500 pounds the day of the wedding. Therefore, Sergeant, collect your luggage turn around and go to Weatherbury tonight. How do you know that I will accept 50 pounds and then not go to the wedding? I know I can not appeal to your honor, but his cunning. 500 pounds is much money to waste. Frank? - Frank? Is that you? - I have to go to meet him. - No! Go! - I can not leave without telling! - Become desperate because of me. - Well, be brief. - Frank, you're late. - Oh, God. Knew was coming. How could you doubt it? Liddy went to his grandfather's house and also bestowed upon the others. We have the house to us. Go upstairs. I'll be in bed in five minutes. Do you see my dilemma? I can not marry the two. Prefer to marry Fanny, because I like more. And of course, you would make it worthwhile. - I kill you! - She did not appreciate it! Bathsheba Marry ... waive it. You must love him a lot. I thought he was worried by Fanny. Marry Bathsheba, Troy! Do not give up! Le note 500 pounds the day of the wedding. What will I get something now? Please ... I have 20 pounds here. But I must be sure he will marry her. Writing. I'll go look for it and signed it. She must not know anything! Come to my house! I'm waiting! Wait here. I'll get a paper. Did he think the break? It is a ridiculous, Boldwood. I'm no angel, but do not buy or sell to women. "Married? Fanny left me long ago. I do not know where it is. Say you love Bathsheba, but at a shred of evidence and considered a whore. Please! Now that I have given a lesson can keep your money. I do not want. I do not want! I will pay, Troy. I will pay dearly! It is the first time I have a real house. Belong here. It's mine. I've never belongs anywhere. I just find refuge in the army, but ... And your family? My mother was French. Was governess to the children the Earl of Severn y. .. Conde noble lover. They married soon, when they knew I was underway. - What about the clock? - It was him. Gave it to me when came of age. It was my only legacy. "CEdit love rebus" The family motto Severn. "Love yields to circumstance." - Did you know the count? - I never said. I saw him only once. Paid for my education. That is what I am, Bathsheba. A bastard. For not belong anywhere. If you have a child the clock will be for him. Know who he is. - Good morning, comrades. - Good morning, Sergeant. He married her, then. Say good morning. No need to be honest. This house is old and dark. I have intention to reform, make it more modern. We have to be happy, while we can. Coggan, Do you know if there is a madman in the family of Mr. Boldwood? Once I heard that His uncle was not right in the head, I do not know if it was true. Well, never mind. Com I'll be on the field you soon. Maintain the same familiarity. Here's half a crown, to drink to my health. Not accept any gift from Him. Cain, tell the Sergeant that comes a storm. If you are not covered haystacks, lose them. Tell him it's important. Sergeant Troy says it will not rain and not bothered by this nonsense. Will you marry me? Friends, tonight we celebrate just a good harvest. It is also the conclusion a wedding. I recently had the take pleasure this lady, her mistress, the altar. We have not had the opportunity to celebrate our wedding ... publicly. So to celebrate it as it deserves, and that you can go to sleep happy I sent for brandy and pitchers of rum. Yes! Three pitchers for each guest! No, no, Frank. Have had enough. We want no more. Thank you, Sgt. Nonsense! Friends, friends! We send women and creatures to bed and we celebrate ourselves as it deserves. And showing cowardice and can fetch work elsewhere. Is that you, Frank? It's in the barn! "I can help? If you do not mind climbing the stairs dark, could approach these bundles. Will we cover everything before it starts to rain? Yes, if we hurry. He promised he would. You better get off. Gabriel, I guess I thought when I left run to Bath that night, I went to get married with Sergeant Troy. At first, yes. And You should also think other things. But it was not so. I went there to finish it. But when I went to go ... I said this morning he had seen a woman more beautiful than me. That promise could not be faithful to me, unless I marry him. And jealousy and attraction I married him. Bathsheba. No blame. There may have been found another. Come home. I will finish it alone. Thanks, Gabriel. Thanks a thousand times, for everything. I forgot haystacks of this year. Is a big part of their harvest, sir. Things I have not done very well lately, Oak. Hoped to organize a little my life, but ... somehow my plans have gone down. I'm sure laughingstock of the district. Absolutely, sir. Not for me. Oak ... I can not get rid my miserable his sufferings. No. Whatever they say, the truth is that I left. I never promised anything. Indeed, it was nothing. Everything was more created by other than by us. It was nothing. Have a nice day. Lord. If it had not fallen in the last obstacle, would have gained 200 pounds. It is a stupid throw that way my money, Frank. Promise me you will not come back tomorrow. If you make a good day bring me thinking. I would rather run 160 Km in the opposite direction. You have lost the courage and cunning you used to have. Had sabiod as you were, behind that anger, I never would ... Please, you know what time Casterbridge closes hospice? I do not know. - Poor! - Stay where you are. Go to the top of the hill. I deal with it. - You? - Vamos! Frank? - Frank, are you? - We looked everywhere. I thought you were away here or you were dead. - Why did not you come to the barracks? - I could not. - You were so distant with me in the church. - Fanny, was angry. I went to your accommodation, but ... Not good. - You have money? - No. You can not go to the hospice. This is all I have. Damn! They are just pennies. I left the army, Fan. Now I have only what gives me my wife. I can not give you anything more. Go there only tonight. Can you walk? We'll meet tomorrow ten in Grey's Bridge. No, Fanny, do not misunderstand. At ten o'clock. - I'll take all the money you can. - Frank ... What happens? Nothing. Fanny, I'm so sorry! Now I can not do anything else, but I will. I promise. - Do you know? - No. - I think so. - Think what you want. Can you give me 20 pounds, Bathsheba? Why racing again? Do not go, Frank. - Stay home with me today. - It's not for racing. Then what? I worry with those mysterious commitments. And you worry me with those suspicions. Do not get too far, Bathsheba, or you'll end up regretting. I already do. - What do you regret? - My love affair comes to an end. All love stories end with marriage. Do I need to laugh my costs? And you are silly to my costs. I think I hate. Do not hate. Hate your faults. Let us end this discussion. Give me 20 pounds and be at peace. If needed, take it. I guess I will have already gone when you return from the ranch. I promised to meet someone. Not long ago, would have required many promises to get away from me. When I was more valuable than any other pleasure. Who are these hairs? - Yours, of course. - Liar! No, I forgot I had them. - They are blonde! - Not true! Do not insult me, the hair are blond. Who are they? You're my husband! You should not save another woman's hair! - Tell the truth, Frank! - Do not make a drama! God help me. Joseph. What message do you bring? One sad, patron. Most will not see Fanny Robin. He died at the hospice of Casterbridge. Fanny is dead? Mr. Boldwood sent car to bring her home. And the pastor's buried today at four in the afternoon. No, no, Fanny is my responsibility. You go to the search, Joseph. Use the new car with red wheels. Clean it. Put the garden foliage. Put it nice for her. I will do my best, Mrs. How went to the hospice, Joseph? Was there a long time? It seems that only since last night, Ms. They say they came on foot from Melchester, and that it killed her. Should have been here. Why not come home? What time could have happened the road to Casterbridge, Joseph? Yesterday afternoon, I think. - Yesterday afternoon ... - Yes, more or less. You'd better go, Joseph. See you soon, Joseph. Come on. - Liddy? - Yes, ma'am. What color was the hair Fanny? Golden, Mrs. He had a blond hair. People always commented. It's horrible death in a hospice. I hope I never such misfortune occurs. They said that her lover was a soldier The same regiment Mr. Troy. Soon dark. - Where is Poorgrass? - Last hour left. - What could have happened? - Maybe you've stopped at Buck's Head. - Oh, no! - Not by Fanny died in the car! Take another, Joseph. After a drink, a man has twice the force. Work smoothly. Well, thank Providence I do not stay away from drinking. Joseph Poorgrass, If you are a disgrace! Leave a dead woman outside in the dark! - You are a Cuba! - No, pastor, not true. The only thing they suffer is ... Multiple viewing. That's why you see double. "Fanny Robin and son" It is too late and dark to make a funeral with dignity. Could lead the body home, Ms. Troy, or it could stay in the church until tomorrow morning. Is better than relocate to the church. No, the church is cold and lonely. Take her home. Would be better off in church would soon be there with flowers and others. No, it is not polite nor Christian. Take her home. What is it, Liddy? It's a wicked story, Ms. I know that can not be true. They say that Fanny died in childbirth. I can not believe it. Only written name of Fanny. We would have said, if true, right? Maybe. Go to bed. Oh, Fanny. Wanted as 'd tell me your secret. Well? What happened? Who's dead? - Let! - No! You stay! Is your son? I had a child. No! Fanny Robin was my maid! Do not kiss, Frank. Kiss me! She means more to me of what you've been ever! Or you, or you will be! And if Satan had not tempted me your pretty face would have found and I would have married her! Oh, Fanny, forgive me. Before God, you're my wife. If she is that ... "What am I? Do you? You're nothing to me. Nothing! Madam, I have been looking for everywhere. Have you been here all night? Is he at home? It was when they came to find the coffin. "They've taken? Oh, Liddy. Poor thing! Come. Getting sick. No! Mr. Oak has come early, Ms. He came to ask how it was. "Mr. Troy has returned home? The children say they have a nice tombstone of Fanny. I do not know who paid for it. Damn you, God! O Lucifer. Or whoever you are. - Seeking to Ms. Troy. Is he here? - I am Ms. Troy. Sorry to be bearer bad news, Madame. Her husband drowned in Lulwind Cove. No. No. Good to see you out home, Liddy. Your boss seems to have improved after a visit from his aunt. Yes, sir. - I guess more lively. - Yes, animated. - Terrified, you say? - No, I said it is more lively. - Do you consider all your problems? - Yes, sir. I've been with him when you had problems. With the lack of Mr. Troy and all that. And if you remarry ... I hope to continue at his side. Do you have promised? No, I have promised. It's just a feeling. Yes, I understand. When referring to the possibility to marry again, deduce ... He did not say never, sir. Past should not do so long with the rake, Liddy. It is better to be short and quick. Maybe now that returns to its owner not want to give up their freedom. He once said that could remarry within 7 years if he did not believe that Mr. Troy return to claim it. Could marry now any sensible person, is what the lawyers say. - Why? Do consulted? - By God, no! Good afternoon. Thanks for appreciating the brave challenge! Thanks! Gentlemen, Jack continues to be the champion! I will try. Well, here we go. Leave it to me, man. The Royal London Hippodrome is pleased to present Dick Turpin's horse rides to York! And death or better ... the tragic death Black Bess! - Ms. Troy. - Mr. Boldwood. I hope that today has luck with his sheep. Yes, a lot. Gabriel has to do to an ultimate purchaser. - What is that? - The show is about to begin. They say it's very funny. I was not allowed to go to these sites when I was young. You have to see. I buy some tickets right away. No, I can not enter. I have yet to see a buyer. But he likened a you input. Vamos! Vamos! For the first time, we have a crowd out there. Come! Are you all right, gentlemen? It is a comfortable place, right? Are you all right there, ladies? Is everything all right. Do not worry. That is our patron. Stop! Friend or foe? Stop! Friend or foe? Stop! Friend or foe? Open the door, stupid! Dick Turpin is on the run. Come on, open! Okay! In God's name, What do you think you're doing? I have a creditor out there. If I speak, I recognize. - You need to talk. They paid for it. - I say no. We still have to do the rest of the show! I will not speak. Not notice the difference. Joseph Poorgrass, what are you doing there? You have to take Ms. Troy home. Flashing women come get me. Hundreds! Thousands! Joseph! I have to do to a buyer. Want to lose that attraction? Multiple vision Viva! Hope you're not thinking to tell what you saw, Fray. Or else you strangle. Everyone thinks he's dead. As you can see, I'm not. How are things at the ranch? How is my wife? Gabriel named as foreman. And Mr. Boldwood as supervisor. And it is introducing all these modern machines. He says he can do the work of 20 men. So doing well. - Think again? - Maybe. If returned, the first thing I do is remove Oak and you nombrarte foreman. A condition that ... She knows nothing about my current job. I'm the right man for you, Sgt. Ms. Troy, did a day marry again? Do not think about those things. No, of course not. There never was shown the death of my husband. It may not be a widow. Sometimes I think the first Once it became Weatherbury. When I was something for you before him, but ... That does not mean anything. Never liked me. I liked and respected. - And still does? - Yes You know you can get married within 6 years without any proof of his death? Yes, I know. If I wait until then Do you marry me? But Mr. Boldwood ... Six! Who knows where we are! Do you want to marry someone else? No, of course. I do not like talking about it. Of course not. Just promise me that if he to get married someday, be with me. - I ... - No. I do not expect love. I think an agreement between two people mature. That's what I want. - I think. - When? Christmas. I'll tell you at Christmas. Bring clothing black silk Liddy. He's not going to put that! Should be a bit more cheerful for a night. No, I will dress in black. People just make assumptions, if it did. Prefer not to go. Mr. Boldwood be angry if not. Has not been deprived. Hired violinists. All the people go! Knew it would not so much trouble. Save the dress Liddy. No go. What should I do, Gabriel? Wait you make a promise tonight. I think the sin is to marry with a man who does not love. Love for me is a disgrace either by him or by anyone else. I fear that if not give you my word go crazy. I believe it. I think the future of that man is in my hands. What should I do, Gabriel? Why not give its promise, then? I would. Is that you, Gabriel? Do you know the latest fashion? - No, sir. - What the hell! My hands are shaking. Can you do for me? Are you coming tonight? I'll come when you have finished with barns, sir. Well. Any woman can to keep a promise, Gabriel? It depends. Or rather, an implied promise. I can not answer so it is implied. That word has more holes as a sieve. You've become very cynical. A woman is able to maintain a promise of marriage? You know who I mean. I pressed the issue and end I think he has decided to be kind to me. Do not trust a lot of promise. Still young. Gabriel, I have called other matter. You did a good job on the farm and I make my partner.
