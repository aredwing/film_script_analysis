Molly, wake up and shut up. - Leave Molly alone. - You wanna make something out of it? - Come on,July, beat her up. - Get her, Pepper! - [Shouting] - Stop it! [Shouting Continues] Lay offJuly! If Hannigan wakes up, she'll get sore. It's okay, Molly. You were just having another nightmare. I want my mommy and daddy. Uh, Molly, we ain't got mommies and daddies. And we ain't ever gonna have 'em. That's why we're called orphans. I'm not an orphan! My parents are alive, and they're comin' to get me someday. Yeah, and Annie's got a note that proves it. [Molly] Will you read it to me, Annie? - Please? - Brother, here we go again. "Please take good care of our little darling. Her name is Annie. - She was born..." - Was born on October 28. [Together] We will be back to get her soon. We have left half of a silver locket around her neck... and kept the other half, so that when we come back for her, you will know... that she's our baby! Do you wanna sleep with y! Our teeth inside your mouth or out? Now get to sleep! I know these don't mean anything to you, but they're everything to me. They're proof I got parents. Do you really think they're out there, Annie? Yep. And I'm gonna meet 'em someday. # Maybe far away # # Or maybe real nearby # # He may be pouring her coffee # # She may be straightening his tie # # Maybe in a house # #All hidden by a hill # # She's sittin' playin' piano # # He's sittin' payin' a bill # # Betcha they're young Betcha they're smart # # Bet they collect things like ashtrays and art # # Betcha they're good Why shouldn't they be # #Their one mistake # #Was giving up me # # So maybe now it's time # #And maybe when I wake # #They'll be there calling me baby # # Maybe # # Betcha he reads Betcha she sews # # Maybe she's made me a closet of clothes # # Maybe they're strict as straight as a line # # Don't really care # #As long as they're mine # # So maybe now this prayer's # #The last one of its kind # #Won't you please come get your baby # # Maybe ## [ Clock Chiming] - Now what? - If my folks haven't found me, I'm gonna find them. - Again? - Pepper, watch out for Molly! - But what if Miss Hannigan catches you? - She won't. [Creaking] Boo. Trying to make a break... again. - What the heck are you doing? - Aren't you gonna beat the tar out of me? Have I ever hit any of ya? No, but you've threatened. That's worse. I know. [Laughing] Kid, if any of you think it's bad in here, it's lousy out there. I'm doin' you a favor by not lettin' you go. - What do you say? - I love you, Miss Hannigan. - I can't hear ya! - I love you, Miss Hannigan! - Rotten orphan. - I'm not an orphan! My parents left me with a note saying they'd come back for me. [Laughing] That was 1922. This is 1933. You're an orphan. [Blowing Whistle] - Rise and shine! Rise and shine! - [Girls Moaning] But it's in the middle of the night. Don't you think I know that? Annie here tried to run away... again. So as a little welcome home party, you're all gonna clean this dump till it shines like the top of the Chrysler Building. - What do you say? - [Together] We love you, Miss Hannigan. And I love you. Now, scrub these floors. Strip them beds for the laundry man. Get to work! Now!

Bundles, you're full of applesauce. Oh, Miss Aggie, won't you let me even take you out for an ice cream "sodee"? - No. - How come? 'Cause I'm savin' myself for Oliver Warbucks. Now get the lousy laundry. Get the heck outta here. Oh, very well. So long, fair Aggie. And Merry Christmas to all! [Together] Bye, Mr. Bundles! Miss Hannigan, may we please have our breakfast now? - No. You may have it later. - [Girls Groaning] There's a rush order of dresses you gotta finish.

Annie! Get your little orphan self out here! Miss Hannigan, Annie ain't here. Really? Where is she? Mr. Bundles rolled her out with the dirty laundry. What? I could lose my license.

[Groans] - [Dog Barking] - Don't you even think about... Ow! Bitin' me! - That's the last of'em. - Good, good. All right. Let's drop these at the pound and take our lunch break somewheres warm. - How 'bout Florida? - Yeah, good idea. Hey, come back here! That's mine! Oh, go on. Eat up. What's wrong? Are they chasing you 'cause you're looking for your mom and dad too? Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. Sometimes it seems like the only thing you've got is trouble. But things'll get better.

Only sometimes Sandy forgets his name is Sandy. - Right, Sandy? - Just call your dog. Sandy! Here, Sandy! Come on, boy! Thattaboy. Good Sandy. All right, then. Next time I see you, Sandy better have a leash and license. - Otherwise he goes to the pound for an eternal sleep. - Yes, sir. Now get home before you catch pneumonia in this cold.

I hope you didn't catch a cold out there. - I don't know whatever I'd do without ya. - Scrub the floors yourself? Of all my little girls, Annie here is my favorite. Thanks for bringing her back. Well, seein' as she means that much to you, ma'am, I guess I don't mind... that I spent the whole night chasing after her. Well, if there's anything I can do to repay you, Officer. - Well, actually, there is. - Uh-huh. There was thing mangy mutt with her that got away. He comes sniffin' around, give a holler, and he's off to the pound. Oh, yes, sir. You can count on me, sir. For anything. Ta-ta. All right, the show's over! Back to your rooms! And you... If the Board of Orphans finds out about this, they'll start nosin' around here and I could lose my job. But I thought you hated your job. Oh, no, I love my job. It's kids I hate. You wait here. I'm gonna go cook up your punishment. - And it's gonna be a doozy. - Miss Hannigan, Miss Hannigan! We saw a mouse! A mouse! - Do I look like the exterminator? - There it is!

I don't want you ever to do this again, so you're gonna scrub every inch of this dump... with this. - Glad you're back? - Yes, Miss Hannigan. Liar! What's the one thing I always taught you? Never tell a lie. - That's right. - [Knocking] Excuse me. I was told I'd find a Miss Hannigan here. - And who might you be? - I'm Grace Farrow. The City Board of Orphans said... Look, it was all a mistake. Somehow, Annie got in the laundry basket. Well, one thing led to another, and I had to call the cops. Please don't fire me! I think you must have me confused with somebody else. Oh, I get it. [Scoffs] Uh, listen, honey, if you're peddlin' beauty products, I don't need any. Miss Hannigan, I do not peddle anything. I'm personal secretary to Mr. Oliver Warbucks. - The Oliver Warbucks? - Yes. - The richest man in the world? - Yes. The Board of Orphans sent me here... to extend Mr. Warbucks' personal invitation to an orphan... to spend the holidays in his home. I'm an orphan. I can be ready in five minutes. An orphan child. Perhaps a child like this one. Great idea. I'm a child, and I'm an orphan. A liar! Annie ain't no orphan. She's my little girl, and she's nothing but trouble. That seems hard to believe. Look, you can have any orphan in the joint, only you can't have Annie. If this has something to do with the laundry or the police, perhaps the Board of Orphans should know. She's all yours. - Merry Christmas. - Good. If you'll just sign the paperwork and get Annie's coat. Coat? Why would a kid need a coat? - We'll buy you one at Bergdorf's on the way uptown. - Really? - Yeah. - Bergdorf's? Well, ain't we fancy? - [Girls Gasping] - You'll never guess what happened. - I get to go away for Christmas. - [Girls Cheering] [Girls] Bye, Annie! Bye! # Some women are drippin' with diamonds # # Some women are drippin' with pearls # # Lucky me, lucky me # # Look at what I'm drippin' with # # Little # # Girls ## Gee, it's really big. Everybody! Everybody, this is our Christmas guest, Annie. Annie, this is... everybody. Hello, everybody. Did Mr. Warbucks' plane arrive yet? He called from Teeterboro. His airplane's been delayed, but he's on his way. - May I take your coat, miss? - Will I get it back? - [Chuckles] - Of course you will, honey. Now tell me, what would you like to do first? The floors. I'll scrub them, and then I'll do the windows! No, Annie, Annie! You're Mr. Warbucks' guest. - You're here to have fun. - Really? Really. Now, we've ordered in special things just for you. Mr. Warbucks instructed me to make sure that for the next two weeks... you have a swell time here. # Cecile will pick out all your clothes # You mean I get to wear new things? #Your bath is drawn by Mrs. Greer # Really?

Welcome home, Mr. Warbucks. How was your trip? Don't ask me about my trip. It was a nightmare. My factories are shutting down right and left. It's bad, very bad. I'll be in my study. Mrs. Pugh, bring me a sandwich. President Roosevelt phoned. He's awaiting your call at the White House. Fine. - What did you say your name was? - Annie, sir. Is there any particular reason why you're here? With all the negative press you've been receiving, sir. - Oh, yes, right. - Annie is the orphan you invited for Christmas. - You're a girl. Orphans are boys. - You didn't specify boy, sir. Aw, gee, Mr. Warbucks, sir, that's okay. You can trade me in for a boy. I really liked seeing your house. It sure is big. Annie, I couldn't be more delighted... that you'll be spending Christmas here with me in my big house. What are we supposed to do with her? Well, it is Annie's first night here, so... Then come to my club for dinner and cigars. Sir, your club is for men only. - And I don't smoke. - I see. - Then how about a brandy? - How about a Broadway show? Gee, I've never been to one of those before. Then you'll attend a Broadway show... with Grace. I thought you were going out. Oh, yes, well, see, Mr. Warbucks, I've never met anybody with a real job, except Mr. Bundles, so I'd kinda like to watch you work. Fine. Sometime when I'm not busy. Sir, you're never not busy. Oh. All right. Well, that's about it. Good-bye. Couldn't I watch just a few more minutes? My assessment of the situation, Mr. President? Well, it's pretty darned bad out there. My factories... everybody's factories... are shutting down. Mr. President, I know you're feeling pressure. I'm feeling pressure myself at this very moment. You're coming to New York for the holidays? - Invite him for Christmas! - Why don't you and Mrs. Roosevelt... spend Christmas with me and my new... Annie? Excellent! He said yes! That's wonderful news. So the President of the United States is coming to your house for Christmas? For Christmas dinner. I wonder what Democrats eat. Let's go out and celebrate with Annie. We'll show her the town. - Too much work, Grace. - That's okay, sir. I've never seen New York before, so I'm just as happy to watch you work. You're telling me you live in New York City and haven't seen the place? - Miss Hannigan... - She runs the orphanage. Well, she never lets us kids out. What's New York City like anyway? Well, it's... Hmm? Let me think.

My Annie is going to be adopted by your millionaire? Actually, he's a billionaire, and, yes, he's going to tell her tonight. Well, ain't she the lucky one. Yes, well, if you'll just sign here. Sure. Would you excuse me for one moment, please? [Screaming] Now, where were we? - Hey, sis. - [Sighs] - Glad to see me? - Don't it show? Did they let you out of prison this time, or did you "excape"? - I cut a deal with the warden. - Rooster, you're the only con I know who could con a cop. Thanks. Hey! Meet my new gal. - Lily... Lily... - St. Regis. - St. Regis. - Miss Lily St. Regis. I'm named after the hotel. Oh, which floor? Oh, real nice place you got here. Sure, every day I get down on my knees and pray, "Why me?" Gee, I don't know. Spill it, Rooster. What do you want? [Claps Hands] Me and Lily was in the neighborhood and... Ten bucks to tide me over? Ten bucks? I ain't got ten cents. Get out and take the St. Regis here with you. Hey, wait a minute. You mean, after all your crooked schemes, all you got is lint in your pockets? - Look who's talkin'. - I'm doin'just fine, thank you. Oh, no, sis, you're doin' like I'm doin'. Lousy.

He don't? Where does he live?

You're gonna do fine, sir. Just tell her how you feel... - and speak from your heart. - I'll try. Mrs. Pugh said we could have a picnic right here. That sounds delightful. [Stammering] Annie, before we eat, there's something I want to ask you. But first... Did you know that I was an orphan? No, sir. I lost my parents when I was very young, and, well, from that day on, I vowed to work very hard and become very rich. - And that's just what he did. - Yes. But, Annie, l-l-I never realized... - U-Until he met you... - Exactly. I mean, what's life about... if you don't have anyone to share it with? - D-Do you follow me? - Sure. No, not really. Oh. Maybe this will explain it better. Oh, gee, thank you, sir. L-I noticed that old broken one you always wear, and I thought, off with the old, on with the new. No! I don't want a new one! My mom and dad left me with this one... and a note saying they'd come back for me someday. Mr. Warbucks, you've been real nice to me, but all I want is my parents. I understand. I do, child. If it's your parents you want, then I'll find them for you. But I'll need your locket and that note... so the F.B.I. Can trace them to your mother and dad. Annie, if Mr. Warbucks says he can find your parents, he will... even if he has to pull every string, right up to the President of the United States. Thank you, sir. Annie, we're going to find your parents. We are. I think I'd like to write to the kids about this. Okay? Of course. # Maybe now it's time # #And maybe when I wake # #They'll be there calling me baby # # Maybe ## [Radio] #But, brother you're never fully dressed # - #Without a smile # - [Whistling] # Who cares what they're wearing # # On Main Street or Savile Row # #It's what you wear from ear to ear # #And not from head to toe # # That matters # Ah, the lovely Boylan Sisters. ##[Boylan Sisters Vocalizing] # So Senator, so janitor # So long for a while # # Remember you're never fully dressed # #You're never dressed without an S-M-l-L-E # And so, Annie, as we come to the end of another program, we'd like to thank you. - [Annie] Thank you, Mr. Healey. - It's Annie on the radio! - Who cares? - Shh! - And remember all out there: Oliver Warbucks is offering $50,000... to the couple who can prove they are Annie's parents. $ 50,000! This is Burt Healey saying, smile, darn ya, smile. - Good night! - [Yelling] - That's my favorite. You're a bunch of saps. Who cares if Annie was on the radio? - I do. - Me too.

And there's a $50,000 reward. - Well, how do you like them apples? - Isn't it great? Great. Get to bed before I paddle ya. But what about our dinner? - What about it? - You didn't give us any. 'Cause I knew you was gonna be bad tonight, so I punished ya ahead of time. Now scatter. $50,000 reward. I hate that kid so much I could be her mother. - Excuse me. - If you're gonna rob the place, start by taking the orphans. [Chuckles] Actually, miss, the wife and l... We're Ralph and Shirley Mudge, by the way. - We were looking for whoever runs this place. - You're lookin' at her. Then, um, maybe you can help us. You see, about 11 years ago, we left our little baby here. She was a little boy. I mean, girl. It's just so hard to tell when they don't have no hair. Right, honey? You mean, you're Annie's parents? - Yes. - I don't believe it. I told you she wouldn't believe us. Wait a minute! - Rooster! - You got to admit it, sis, we fooled you, huh? Right up until when your girlfriend there opened her trap. - Rooster, you sure know how to pick 'em. - Don't he though? Aggie, we're gonna blow this town with all the dough we'll ever need. I got a plan. - I bet it's foolproof. - One hundred percent. We're gonna fool Warbucks and grab those 50 G's. You and every other con artist this side of the Hudson. Yep, but those other cons ain't got an artiste workin' over in Brooklyn... - making fake birth certificates. - Keep talkin'. And those other cons ain't got a sister... who knows all there is to know about the kid. Yeah, yeah, I know all about Annie. I also know Miss St. Regis here ain't got the brains for the job. She makes one slip, and we all end up behind bars for life. - Yeah, you're right. Lily's out. - And I'm in. Sorry, sister. - But... - Now about the 50 grand... Here's the split. Half for me, half for you two. - Deal. - Hey! Wait a gosh-darned minute. - You wanna be cut out of the deal completely? - Heck, no! Then stop whinin'. - One last detail, Rooster. - Shoot! Annie... Once we got the kid, what do we do with her? I make her disappear. Then we head straight for... Straight for where, Rooster? # Easy Street # [All] # Easy Street # #That's where we're gonna # # Be ## [ Chattering] Well, let's hope for the best. We're her real parents! We're her real parents! [Shouting] Ladies and gentlemen, please fill out your questionnaires truthfully... and any specific details will be most helpful. Sir, I think every liar, thief and crackpot... showed up on our doorstep today. So many sob stories, but nobody mentioned giving Annie the locket. Did they show up yet? It appears that everyone who claims they were your parents are fakes. Oh. Well, I'm sure my real parents'll show up. Maybe they missed their train or got lost or something. Sir, this just arrived via special messenger from the F.B.I. Good. The information about Annie's locket. "Between 1918 and 1924, 90,000 of Annie's type of locket were made and sold." The F.B.I. Says it's impossible to trace your parents through it. I'm so, so very sorry. Drake, let's you and I check on the Christmas menu. You did the best you could, sir. Thank you for all you've done. You know, I guess a kid can do okay without parents. Looks like you got everything you wanted. I'm afraid that isn't so, Annie. # I've made me a fortune # #That fortune made ten # # Been headlined and profiled # #Again and again # # But something was missing # # I never quite knew # #That something was someone # # But who # # My speeches are greeted # #With thunderous acclaim # #At two universities # # Bearing my name # #Yes, something was missing # # Each time I got through # #That something was someone # # But who # #Who could # #That someone be # # How could she make it # # Known # #Who would need me # # For me # # Need me for me # #Alone # Annie, I love you as if you were my own little girl. I want to adopt you. Would you consider it? It's just that I love my real mother and father so much. I don't know if I could love anybody else. I understand, but if you could find a place in your heart for me... #The world was my oyster # # But where was the pearl # #Who dreamed I would find it # # In one little girl # #Yes, something was missing # # But dreams do come true # #That something # # Is no one # # But you # Mr. Warbucks, if I can't have my real parents, I think I'd really like it if you'd be my father. I have an idea. Grace! - Yes, Mr. Warbucks. Is everything all right? - Couldn't be better. TelephoneJustice Brandeis and ask him to come over to sign the adoption papers. Oh! That's wonderful news! Oh, Mr. Warbucks, that's wonderful ne... Um, when shall I tell the judge to come? Well, Grace, it's Christmas Eve. Let's have the adoption tonight and a big party as well. - Tell Mrs. Pugh to order in flowers, champagne, caviar. - And ice cream and roasted corn. Did you hear the little lady? Ice cream and roasted corn... and all the Christmas decorations left in the city of New York. - Yes, sir. - And Grace, extend our invitation to everyone in the house. Miss Grace, will you be there too? 'Cause it's really nice when you're both together. Grace, will you join us? Well, I'd be honored. Wonderful. Let's get ready. L-I'll take care of everything! Mr. Warbucks, the house is ready. [Sighs] Drake, it's never looked better. You've really outdone yourself this time. Thank you, sir. Annie! Are you ready? Leapin' lizards! Just look at this joint! - You know what, Annie? - What? I think I'm the luckiest man in the world. And I think I'm the luckiest kid.

The house is all spiffed up. Looks like we're ready. That's a very pretty dress you're wearing, and you look very pretty in it. Thank you for noticing, sir. Justice Brandeis. Brandeis! So happy you could make it on such short notice. Happy to be here to preside over this momentous occasion. - And this is Annie. - Oh, how nice to meet you. Well, Oliver, Annie, I'm ready to begin if you are. - I'm ready, Judge. - Me too. - [Barking] - I guess it's unanimous. - Shall we begin? - Sir? Sir, before you start... May I present the Mudges. [Gasping] - There she is. - [Crying] - Who are you? - We're your mommy and daddy. - [Barking] - Mind your manners. We're Ralph and Shirley Mudge. - Ain't she cute, Ralphie? - Oh, she's a regular doll. Annie Mudge? - [Growling] - Sandy! Shh! Be polite. Drake, please. Perhaps we should discuss this privately. - Well, we was kids and poor, sick... - And dumb to leave you. But we had no choice. You see, a nice man in Canada offered us a job on a farm. - No babies allowed. - No. So, we had to leave ya for a little while. Eleven years is more than a little while. Mr. And Mrs. Mudge, yours is a touching story, but... But l-l-I suppose you'd like to see some I.D. Well, here's our driver's licenses... and, um, Annie's birth certificate. It appears to be in order. Born: New York, October 28, 1922. - That's my birthday. - Those are the dates in Annie's note. Yes, but I'm still not sure. Finally, we saved up enough money to come looking for our little girl. We got into town, and we went straight to where we left our little baby. And the very nice... and very attractive... lady at the orphanage said we'd find Annie here. - I still can't believe we found our baby. - Me neither. [Both Sobbing] Mr. And Mrs. Mudge, there is one more thing. Oh! You know, with all the thievin' that goes on in orphanages, I bet you don't have what we left with you all those years ago. You wouldn't happen to have the other half of this? Would you? - [Gasping] - Look, Ralphie! - The locket. She's wearin'it! Perfect fit, so if you just get Annie's things, we'll be on our way. Mr. Mudge. - What about the money? - Oh, of course. You'll be wanting something for having taken care of her. Well, we ain't got much, but... here. You didn't know that Mr. Warbucks was offering a $50,000 reward... - for the couple who can prove they're Annie's parents? - He is? Well, we sure don't want no money. - No, no, no, no. - Just... We want our little girl. Come on, Pa. On the other hand, with $50,000, we could afford to bring Annie up right. - Uh-huh. - [Stammering] In what form might this money be? Certified check. You can pick it up tomorrow with Annie. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow? I'd like Annie to spend Christmas morning with us. If that suits you? Oh, yes, please. We've lived without her for 11 years. I guess one more night won't hurt. Come, Shirley. Wait, I just want one more look at my sweet angel! She's a dream! A dream! [Sobbing] [Door Opens, Closes] Come on. Let's join the rest of the guests, tell them your wonderful news. Thank you, Drake. Everyone, Annie has finally found her parents. - Here's to Annie Mudge. - [All] To Annie Mudge. # Silly to cry Nothing to fear # # Betcha where they live's as nice as right here # # Betcha your life is gonna be swell # # Lookin' at them # # It's easy to tell # #The sun'll come out tomorrow # # Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow # #There'll be sun # #Just thinkin' about tomorrow # # Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow # #Till there's none # #When you're stuck with a day # #That's grey and lonely # #You just stick out your chin and grin # #And say # #The sun'll come out tomorrow # # So you gotta hang on till tomorrow # # Come what may # #Tomorrow, tomorrow # # I love ya tomorrow # #You're only a day # #Away ## Aw, come on, why can't I go with youse guys? 'Cause you can't leave children all alone, that's why. Huh! Since when did you care about those little tykes? It's Christmas. My heart is full of glad tidings of great joy. - Now let's go get that raggedy Annie. - Catch you later, baby doll. But l-l-I ain't the motherly type. [Coughs] - Merry Christmas, Annie. - Merry Christmas, Annie. Merry Christmas. Did you look under the tree to see if Santa left you anything? No, he brought me my parents. That's plenty. Think they'll let me keep Sandy... and let me come visit you, sir, and Miss Grace? Yes, of course, they will. You look like you didn't get any sleep. Oh, yes, well, we've been talking with the president... and working with the F.B.I. All through the night, and they haven't turned up anything suspicious, so... So I'm really a Mudge... Annie Mudge. Where's our little Christmas present? - We know she's here somewhere. - Mr. And Mrs. Mudge. - [Barking] - [Whimpering] You will let me keep him, won't you? - Why, of course. - [Barks] The only thing I love more than little girls is little dogs. Don't I, Ralphie? Come on, Sandy. Well, we better be on our way with our little Annie. - And our little check. - So soon? Annie hasn't even opened her presents yet. - Sorry, we ain't got time. - Very well. If you'll come this way, we'll prepare the check. - Darn. Lost again. - [Girls Laughing] Gosh! You sure you girls never played poker before? Beginner's luck. How much she owe us? $479.39. What? Where am I gonna get that kind of loot? Hey, why am I worryin'? I'll be rollin' in it when Rooster and Hannigan get back from Warbucks'. - That's where Annie is. - Oops. What's goin' on? Spill the beans. Nuh-uh. My lipstick is sealed. Yeah, but your purse ain't. Hey, give that back right now! Yeah, I'm sure the cops'll be very interested in your fake I.D.s. [Screams] You watch it. Get out of my way. I want those back right now. Fess up! Okay, okay! Rooster and Hannigan are pretending... to be Annie's parents for the reward money. And when they get back, I'll be sittin' large and livin' pretty. What makes you so sure they'll be comin' back? [Chuckles] Because I'm Rooster's dame. He'd never let me take the rap and spend three months on Rikers Island. Again. Sir, the Mudges' certified check for $50,000. - Well, nice meeting you all. - We'd better get. Cheerio. Toodle-oo. Ta-ta. See you in church. - [Laughing] - Aren't you forgetting something? Oh! How silly of us. We've been childless for so long, it's gonna take some getting used to. - Come on, precious. So sweet. - Come, Annie. - [Muffled] Come on. - Unhand me! - You messed with the wrong dame! - What are you doin' here? Makin' sure I get my piece of the cake. I want my moolah. Out of my way! [Screaming] - [Together] We love you, Miss Hannigan! - Run for it, Aggie! [Man] In the name of the United States government, I command you to halt. Who do you think you are, the president? - [Gasping] - Geez, Aggie, it is. Well, if it isn't the Mudges. Or should I say, Miss Agatha Hannigan... and Daniel Francis Hannigan, also known as "Rooster" Hannigan, also known as "Danny the Dip." Also known as, "The jig is up, Rooster." Lily St. Regis, also known as Miss Sadie Algonuin, also known as "Phyllis the Filcher." Also known as, "You loused up big, Lily." Well, it ain't Easy Street, but at least I'm wearin' silver. Don't that hotel of yours ever shut its doors? Uh, it was his idea. He made me do it. Annie, Annie, tell these people how good I always been to ya, huh? Miss Hannigan, I would, but the one thing you always taught me was: Never tell a lie. Brat! I'll let you in on a little secret. I never liked you. Never. You're nothing but a rotten gold digger. I've always been so good to ya, and this is what I get, huh? You drove me to this! # I'm headed straight for the nuthouse # #With all the nuts and the squirrels # #There I'll stay tucked away till the prohibition of # # Little # # Girls ## Miss Hannigan's gone forever! [Cheering] Annie, I also have some important news for you. Oliver. The F.B.I. Were finally able to trace the handwriting on that note of yours... to a David and Margaret Bennett. You mean the Bennetts are my real parents? Where are they? Annie, I'm sorry, it seems they passed away some time ago. So, I really am an orphan. Annie, are you all right? Yeah. I think so. See, I always knew my parents loved me, and they'd come back for me, if they were alive. I guess you have to look at the bright side. At least I'm not a Mudge. [All Laughing] I hope this is the start of a wonderful new life for all of us. And I'll see to it that each and every one of you... will be adopted by a fine, upstanding family. [Cheering] And Annie picked out Christmas presents for all of you. - They're waiting underneath the Christmas tree. - [Cheering] Grace! When I talk about a new life for all of us... I do mean all of us. And if you'd still like to be Annie Bennett Warbucks... I'd like that more than anything. I love you very much, Annie. And I love you, Daddy Warbucks. #Together at last # #Together forever # #We're tying a knot # #They never can sever # [Together] # I don't need sunshine now # #To turn my skies to blue # # I don't need anything but you # #You've wrapped me around # #That cute little finger # #You've made life a song # #You've made me the singer # [Together] #And what's the title of the dream # #That's just come true # - # I don't need anything # - #Anything # #Anything # # I don't need anything # # But you ## ##[Orchestra: "Tomorrow"] ##[Orchestra: "N.
