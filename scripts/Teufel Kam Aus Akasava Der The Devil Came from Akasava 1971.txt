Tell me, what happened? l took the stone- the stone, in- Were you in the cave? Yes. l... l found it- the stone- l found it. l'll get a doctor. l'll drive over to Thorrsen and ask him to come here. Wait for me and watch out. What do you want? What are you doing? No... you can't do that. Good morning! ls your husband at home? - Yes, but he's in surgery right now. - Would you please ask him, whether he could come right away? Joao, my assistant, is seriously injured. - He has to help him. - l'll tell him. Yes. lngrid, how many times have l told you not to disturb me? - l'm sorry, but it's urgent. - This is too. Professor Forrester is waiting downstairs. - Forrester? - His assistant is badly injured, and the professor would like you to go with him. l assume you have to operate on the man. - l understand, yes. - Well? Tell him to go home, l'll come as soon as possible. - Good. - Good. - What did he say? - He'll hurry. You can go home again. l assume, he'll be finished here in about half an hour, and he'll come to you right away. By the way, there is a shortcut, approximately four miles from here. Turn right at the first turn-off, that will save you at least 15 minutes. Yes, thank you, l'll do that. And please... every minute is important for life and death here. He'll hurry. Where is that guy? The stone is gone. - One moment, where are you going? - The inspector called me, dear sir. My name is Lambert. We first need to determine, when Professor Forrester disappeared. Hello, Mr. Lambert. So you saw Professor Forrester for the last time, - when he came to your clinic? - Yes, lnspector. You also reported, that he was very agitated... and he told you he would go right back to his place. Yes, he asked my husband to treat an assistant of his, who had been badly injured. He seemed a little confused. Thank you, Mrs. Thorrsen. And now to you, Doctor. What do you think caused the death of the assistant? Stroke. But strangely enough, the professor asked for plasma. Well, he was an archeologist and no medical doctor, he made a mistake. You said 'was,' Doctor. You are implying a fact that has not yet been proven. l would say there is proof. As we all know, his jeep was found completely destroyed, and the police found traces of blood leading into the jungle. But that isn't proof that he is dead. No, no, Doctor, we need facts. Well, this may be correct from your point of view. l only know that traces of blood were found, and for someone injured in the jungle there isn't much of a chance to survive. Well, this is certainly a convincing argument, but as l said, we need proof, how, what and why. l'm really sorry, lnspector, that is something that requires your intellect. Very nice, Doctor, very nice. And now to you, Mr. Lambert. You are an intelligent person and a good businessman, but also the British consul here. What will the government's reaction be in this case? My government will not be able to blame you at all, even though it is your responsibility to avoid something like that. One more thing, Mr. Lambert. Do you know what type of research the professor was working on? You know, he really didn't like to talk about his work, he was very secretive. There has to be some indication. Professor Forrester comes and asks for your help, and he disappears shortly thereafter. What happens then? This is probably something that we will never know. Well, friends, something new? No, sir, unfortunately not. No fingerprints, no papers or anything else to identify the dead body, absolutely nothing. Professor Forrester disappeared, his assistant is dead, and 6,000 miles away a complete stranger is murdered in his office. Well, this is an extraordinarily difficult situation. You will solve it, Sergeant. - A call for you, sir. - Yes, who is it? l don't know, sir, but she sounds charming. You will get far with your intelligence. Hello. lmpossible. No. Just go to hell, please. Stop that. Hello. - ls there a Miss Jane here? - Madam, someone wants to see Jane. Oh, you are looking for Jane? Yes, l have an appointment. l have an appointment today with Miss Jane. Oh, then come closer, sir. Thank you. One moment please. l'll see right away whether Jane is available. Tinkerbelle, pour a drink for the gentleman while he's waiting. Well, what would ''Your Majesty'' like? Oh, thank you, thank you, it is much too early for this. Come please, Jane is expecting you. Third floor on the right. l'm sorry, l didn't want to make any inappropriate moves. Here l am. You are right on time, darling. Now, listen to me. l don't mind working together with your gun-toting Secret Service agents, but l have a reputation to protect. l am a married man and l have to consider my wife. Maybe she would be delighted to hear that you still have some steam under the hood. Am l right? Well, l don't think this is very funny. Oh, my dear Sir Philip, of all the conceited Scotland Yard officials you are the nicest. l almost admire you. You are so wonderfully correct. Oh, Jane... you will ruin me. But come on, we have to talk about this matter. All right then. l'm sorry that l had you come here, but you have to admit that this bordello is an excellent cover. All right, now let's get to the heart of the matter. You have to bring us the man who committed the murder in Forrester's office. Was the guy who was stabbed one of your people? Yes, he was. - And what was he doing there? - He tried to crack the safe. - Hurry, come to bed. - What? Come on, they are watching us. Come on. Yes. - And what are you looking for? - Professor Forrester's assistant... died of a blood disease, according to medical reports. Yes, caused by an unknown form of rays. You are right. We are only interested in one question: The origin and cause of these rays. The Secret Service can depend on Scotland Yard. And now... may l offer you something else? No, for my health... it would be better if l went back to my office now. Oh, Sir Philip, how nice of you to come. - Hello. - Hello. how are you? l'm fine, thank you. Have a seat, please. My leg is a little better now. Well, you know, the damp- it can drive you crazy, but it will probably never heal completely. Your only souvenir from lndia. Oh, no, there is something else. Even if some people see these things as somewhat antiquated, sometimes you do meet the old ghost once more. There is probably not much use in pining for the past. - Well, yes. - By the way, l am sorry. that l have to take up some of your precious time. But my dear friend, l am always available for you. Thank you. Let's get down to business. l know that Professor Forrester disappeared. He was a good friend of mine, and l would like to ask you, to find out everything that you can about what happened to him. But you can't ask me to send someone to Akasava. That is not at all in my area of responsibility. Really, you know you can send someone... - unofficially. - Oh, Sir Philip, how nice to see you again. l hope you are doing fine. We always enjoy seeing a guest. But, please excuse me, l have to take care of the flowers. Certainly. Yes, yes. Sir Philip, could you do a favor for an old friend? Well... Mr. Forrester, there is a telephone call in the bar for you. Mr. Forrester, a telephone call. Mr. Forrester, please. My name is Forrester. There is supposedly a call for me. Thank you. Forrester. Yes. Yes. l understand. lf you say so. lt's okay. All passengers of flight 737 to Mombasa, proceed to gate A. The passengers from London are asked to go to Customs lnspection. Mr. Forrester? - You are Mr. Forrester? - Yes. l was beginning to doubt that l would find you. By the way, l am Tino Celli. l was a good friend of your uncle's. - Excuse me. - Oh, yes. l heard a lot about you. l am happy to meet you. Come. My car is outside. Wonderful. Let's go. Hello. - Can l rent a car here? - Certainly, madam, but you have to wait a moment. May l? Sorry to barge in like this. May l give you a ride to town? No, thank you. l prefer to take a cab. So pretty and so prickly. What a pity, right? - There are no cabs here? - They are all taken. Taxi! Oh, man. - May l invite you now? - Okay, one point for you. My name is Jane Morgan. My friends call me Tino. l'm sorry to be so curious but would you tell me please, what you plan to do in our beautiful city? l plan to work here. l am a dancer. Fantastic. lf you are a dancer by profession, you probably don't object to it during your spare time. Yes, l do quite a bit. - A beautiful country, isn't it? - Yes, beautiful. Do you also think that it is so different from dusty, old England? - Yes. What are you doing here? - Oh, you know, nothing really. l am only here in my capacity as nephew. Nice job. Did you ever hear the name ''Walter Forrester'' before? - No, l don't think so. Who is that? - A scientist, who disappeared in Akasava several months ago. He was a mineralogist. l am here to find out whether my uncle is really dead. l have to know what happened. Now, don't be depressed, we'll find him, alive and cheerful. Everything that we have heard so far has only been suppositions by some people. There is absolutely no proof that he is dead. - Are you married? - No. Why are you asking? The only possible reason why you rejected my invitation. You have very little imagination. My name is Morgan. Jane Morgan. Yes, please. Yes, Miss Morgan. The bellboy will show you to your room. - Thank you very much, once more. - See you later. As fate would have it, my room is directly next to yours. Jane... will you go to dinner with me? lt depends. But you can find me in the club. Okay. l'm looking forward to it. Jane! How nice to see you. l'm sorry, may l introduce myself? - Lambert. - Yes. Nice to meet you. l registered you as my wife, because l don't want people to ask any questions. This is a very dangerous situation for you. All right, you are a better judge of that than l. Tell me something about you. You make it easy for me. You are good-looking... - you are young. - Please. l would like to know something about my new identity. Oh yes... a very interesting person. Jane Morgan, 23 a dancer from Jamaica. You have been married to me for two years, and Morgan is the name that you perform under. l never talked about you because we are separated. We can't make it too obvious for the others. Anybody could be a murderer. Be careful. You are young and pretty, Jane. l don't want anything to happen to you, but anything is possible. We have to go. Fantastic! l get ideas. lf you don't try it with her, l'll get upset. Wonderful. Good. Bravo. l didn't think you were that good, Jane. You really can be charming! l like you better without clothes than with. - ls it all right like this, you old peacock? - Yes, perfectly posed. - Hello, Walter. - How charming. Since you are not willing to come to us, l decided to come to you. How nice. But l never quite know... l am Dr. Thorrsen's wife, Mr. Forrester. Oh, really? l heard a lot about you and your husband, Mrs. Thorrsen. l wanted to drive out to your place anyway, but how nice to meet you today already. My husband is very busy right now, that is why he couldn't come. Are you sorry he couldn't? Absolutely not. Would you like to dance? Oh, yes, very much. How about a little drink? l hate hair gel. Thank you very much. - Do you know who that was? - l don't know. He has to disappear from here. But where are we going to put him? But Mr. Forrester... l'm a married woman. At least, married women know what they want. l know it. Oh, Walter. We could take him out through the window in the room next door. - That's the best way. - Okay, let's... There are steps below the window. lt should work. But we have to be careful. Well, let's go. What are you waiting for? Yes, yes. ls something the matter? l just saw something, that l just couldn't have seen. Wait, l'll get the car. Arthur... why are you drinking so much? - Can l help you? - No, he just drank too much. He fell asleep, it happens frequently. - Well, if you say so. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - And thank you. l'll take care of it. Thank you. - What's the matter? - My car is gone. What? Jane, did you recognize the driver? l hope you know how to swim, my dear. Would you like to see the clinic? - Yes, certainly. - Good. lf you wish. lngrid... did you ever consider going back to England? To be quite honest, l never thought about it. l believe in fate. l accept what life brings me. But, Walter, you are not really interested? We both agreed to something here, but we shouldn't consider it too important... at least not right now. You know, l have my work here, and it fulfills me, even if it doesn't appear that way. - Do you know what l want here? - Certainly. You want to find your uncle, but be prepared, he is probably dead. Will you come upstairs with me? But this is terrible. lt seems as if they are no longer alive. They have narcolepsy, don't they? Yes, very serious cases. - And what happens to them? - All inmates of this quarantine station... will be taken by us to a special treatment in London. He looks more than 100 years old. - Where did he come from? - l don't recall. One day he was here, just like all the others. Completely apathetic and without any memory. And nothing is known about them? No. We will probably never know anything about them. ls there no serum or something? So far, modern medicine has not found any serum for it. - What do you do in London with them? - They go to a specialty clinic, run by Dr. Henry, they can do more for them there. Andrew? l want you to meet Mr. Forrester. - Hello. - Hello. Your uncle was one of my best friends. l heard that you were one of the last people to talk to my uncle. Yes, l think so. But someone must have seen him after that. Let's go have a cup of coffee. Come. - What is your theory, Doctor? - lt's the jungle... very simple. You don't seem to think so, Mr. Forrester. l must be absolutely certain. lf we can help you, you will find us in Rio dos Mortes. What a charming name. - lt means... ''River of Death.'' - That's what l thought. An old legend says that it is the devil's birthplace. l like strange old tales. Sometimes these legends hold a kernel of truth. What do you think? Come, continue. Well... there is supposedly some stone, that changes a certain metal to gold under the right circumstances. This mineral has rays that burn everything, it must be a completely unknown type of mineral. Professor Forrester, your uncle, found one of these stones someplace. Some criminals must have found out about it and kidnapped him to find out where he found the stone. Because whoever has one of these stones, controls the world's gold market. A nice fairy tale. Really. Oh, no, this is most certainly no fairy tale. Okay, let's assume that there is some truth to this story. Has anybody ever seen one of these stones? Certainly. You don't believe that they wouldn't look for them otherwise? Well, then tell me everything. Well, l took your nice dead body with me, - in your own car. - Why? l wanted to save you from a few years in government housing. - Extraordinarily funny. - Do you know, there is someone, whose machinations are hard to comprehend. - And who is that? - Dr. Thorrsen. - Eavesdropping is fun, isn't it? - Who's eavesdropping? Jane, it's all right. May l introduce you to Major Celli of the ltalian Secret Service? lf that is the case, then l did eavesdrop. Maybe you can imagine what we plan to do. Certainly. l assume you want to take a closer look at Dr. Thorrsen's clinic, and he would be in the way. You will never see such beautiful flowers in a greenhouse. They really are beautiful. - Walter, what is it? - Damn it- - somebody took a shot at me. - Come, l'll help you. Well, l'm afraid your leg is broken. - Damn it, what else? - Oh, it's not that bad. We only have to give you a plaster cast. lt's not that bad. Why don't you give Mr. Forrester a sedative? - lt will get better. - lt's enough for me, if l feel the way l used to. Why don't you cheer up, Walter? This way you at least get to come to London with us and we'll stay together. Oh, then l'm really very happy. Now start to count from one to 10. One... two... three... four... five... six. Yes. Do you really think his leg is pretty bad? Really, sweetheart, stop it. Are you really seriously concerned about him? l only want to know what's going on. Remember once and for all- what l do here, l do for both of us, do you understand? For both of us. Would you tell me now what you plan to do with him? Our dear young friend will take the stone for us to London, packaged in lead and plaster. But why him? Because nobody will suspect Professor Forrester's nephew. - Understood? - But that is much too dangerous. Only for him. Not for us. - What would you like? - Champagne. - There you go. - Yes, thank you. Do you like her? l can't stand her. l don't either. Oh, really? - And l hate you. - Oh, how charming. First you love me, now you hate me. No objections. The only thing that l can't stand is you don't care at all. Oh, hello. - Good evening. - We haven't seen each other for ages. Thank you for the invitation. We enjoyed your performance. You are doing this very, ah, seductively, l must say. Oh, thank you very much, l must admit, l always... am a little afraid, when there are friends in the audience. Tell me, why did you invite us tonight? Well, you know, l feel so alone, everything is so boring, so terribly bland. Yes, l understand, l also think it is boring here. And l have a lot of work waiting for me back at the clinic. My husband sometimes is less than polite. - l'm sorry. - But it was only a joke. Come and have a drink with us. What a shame that l have to leave now, but my wife will keep you company. Goodbye. There is something that bothers me. Why did you invite us? l don't understand. l will try to get in. Wait here. Lambert. How did this happen? l was at Dr. Thorrsen's clinic with Tino. Tino went in by himself. He is probably dead. Someone took a shot at me. Stop this nonsense. He is dead, isn't he? Yes, he is dead. Come. Hurry up and come. lt is terrible. Someone took a shot at me with a rifle from the door. Who are you really? Don't tell me that he is your husband. How do you know? How do you know? Do you think l'm an idiot? You can't play this comedy for me. Do you have any proof that l am? Oh, God, l have eyes in my head, that's enough. You can't pretend with me. l like you anyway. You don't like to wait for someone to ask something of you, do you? But if you really want to take it that far, why don't you stay here? Now l would like to ask you. But it will be short and sweet, - l'm leaving for London at 8:00. - What? For London? Wonderful. So what should l do now with a dead body in my room? Don't worry, l have good friends, they will help you. For sure. Who? - Not the woman from the clinic? - No. Not that one. She is flying to London with me. Now, why be upset? Lord Kinsley, how nice to see you. And how nice to see you. We meet much too rarely. Why don't you come to tea sometime? And this is Humphrey, my new nurse. - So when will you come and see us? - We have a lot of work. - May l call you? - Certainly. l neglected to introduce you to Walter Forrester. Nice to meet you, young man. - Bring him along sometime. - Thank you, sir, l would enjoy that. - How is your leg? - One gets used to it, slowly. Only the wheelchair is a little irritating. - But you look excellent. - Oh well, l have nothing else to do but to take care of myself. l hope that we will see each other soon. - l hope so too. - Goodbye, Mr. Forrester. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Who was that? An old friend of ours, a multi-millionaire. He is our patron. A charming old man, who made his fortune in lndia. An interesting friend. What are you thinking? This man is one of the last philanthropists. Without him, we would have never been able to set up our clinic. He was extremely helpful. He basically supplied us with all that we needed to build the clinic, as well as what we still need now. Yes, yes, it's healing well. Your husband did a good job. l believe that we can replace the cast with something a little lighter. That would make me very happy. l can hardly carry it any longer. ln half an hour you'll hop around again. Dr. Henry, something happened. lt's patient number 77. - What is the matter? - He disappeared. Come on. Look in the park or in the hallways. Very well. What is with this patient? Doctor, what is going on with him? We don't want to talk about my problems but free you of your cast instead, my dear man. l really feel a lot better. Go get some fresh air with him, it will be good for him. Make sure that he doesn't walk too much. l would suggest you bring him to the hotel later on. Make sure he keeps his leg still. Yes, sure. Oh, one moment. Ah, that feels good. Hello? What? Nobody knows where he is? No, don't call the police. Hello, darling. Don't move. One moment. What is the matter with you? l'm the one asking questions here. Who are you? l am Walter. What kind of nonsense is that? Don't tell me some kind of story. Forrester never had a nephew. l swear you're wrong. - My uncle... - Shut up. l want to know who is your boss. Now, let's tell the truth. Who do you work for? Spit it out. You can kill me, if you want, but l will never tell you. Bravo. The Secret Service people are very straightforward. Secret Service? How do you know about that? l just happen to work for Scotland Yard. Well... tell me. lt is about Forrester's disappearance, and also about this mysterious stone. Apparently, three different groups are after it. But which one is the most dangerous for us? What are we going to do? - Cooperate? - Good. Yes. Their faces were completely black and charred, and their hair was white. There is nothing that we can use as proof. - The matter is completely stuck. - So what can we do now? First of all, our opponent must be lured out into the open. Let him assume that Professor Forrester left important research results for his nephew Walter. Then he will most certainly do something. He has to approach us. We will most certainly keep surveillance on Walter. We want to get the material in your hands, right? Yes. That means, l am playing bait for you. When do we start? lmmediately. l've already prepared everything. l made... l made it known that the material is in your hands. Good night. How can you simply barge in here, Mrs. Thorrsen? But Dr. Henry, do you plan on hiding something from me? lngrid... lngrid, come here. Andrew. l didn't know you were in London. Why didn't you inform me? There is a lot you don't know, my dear. But why aren't you with your friend? You need to tell me, you with all your dirty affairs. Get out and don't forget to do exactly what l want... otherwise... - Otherwise? - Otherwise everyone will find out how l got Mrs. Thorrsen out of a bordello in Mombasa. Now that would be something interesting for your circle of friends. You could tell your friend over coffee about your experience with dirty harbor rats, you will come up with something. Listen, Mr. Forrester is still missing, we have to conclude the matter. The stone has to get to the lab for processing. Our chemist is waiting there, we have to hurry. What are you waiting for? l have to take care of something first. Hello, this is Thorrsen. We've got it. But our agreement is no longer valid. lt is worth considerably more and we want double the price. l'll give you 24 hours to think about it. Please decide by then, otherwise we'll have to contact other parties who offer more. Yes, call. Sir Philip, after all that you told me, something has become very clear... That four people were killed in Akasava, and probably your friend Forrester as well, because we must assume - that he is dead. - l cannot believe that. Now, the Secret Service is of the same opinion. Then l'm in very good company. The two of us survived quite different problems in lndia, didn't we, my dear Sir Philip? Another cup of tea? Now what kind of secrets are you whispering about now? - Are you turning the world upside down? - Nothing important. Yes. All right. Hm, please treat this information as confidential. Certainly, but there are some circumstances, and a lot of strange coincidences. lt is simply not believable that so many people are killed because of such a ludicrous stone. Yes. But this seems to be the case, my dear Lord Kinsley. But l really am not allowed to discuss this now. But, Sir Philip, l don't want to cause you any problems. You know, l am only interested in one thing... the mysterious disappearance of my old friend Forrester. Hello? What is that? How did you get in here? How charming. Would you please be nice enough to tell me what you want here? - l am Sue. - Oh, well, that really gets us very far. Sue, and Chinese as well. Listen. There are men who want to kill you, do you understand? You are supposed to be killed because of the material - that you received from your uncle. - But it takes two for killing. l am willing to tell you more tonight. Go to the China Restaurant, Down Street. - Please come. - Then l can't say no. How do you know that l am supposed to be killed? Out with it. l can't tell you right now, but l know, that your life hangs by a thread. Hard to believe. Well, then l will come. - Good evening. - l have an appointment. My name is Forrester. l was asked to make you an offer. Then do it. What is that supposed to be? Listen. We offer you for your uncle's material... But you will also have to tell us where the stones were found. lt is your choice, you decide. - lf not? - You will find out. - And where? - At a new location. Go to Wong's, Lincoln Street 29. But you will also have to tell us where the stones were found. lt is your choice, you decide. - lf not? - You will find out. - And where? - At a new location. Go to Wong's, Lincoln Street 29. Humphrey, take care of this. l was supposed to come here to... Someone must have overheard us. We have to get out of here. Hello. Listen. Book two seats to Hong Kong. We are coming right now. - Thank you, my sweet Abigail. - Who is that? That is Forrester. You know Thorrsen was supposed to kill Forrester. He took him to his clinic and disfigured him terribly. - But he didn't kill him. - He is still breathing. Poor Forrester. Release him from his suffering. Well, Abigail. He believed in me until the end. Until he found out, that l only wanted to use his discovery to have absolute power. lf you can change ordinary metal into gold, then you rule the world. Forrester knew that l was financing Thorrsen. And when Thorrsen was unable to kill Forrester after stealing the stone, it was clear to me that only l could be the head. But now there are no more obstacles. Abigail, we will rule the world. Hurry and get dressed. lt is terrible. l just can't believe it. Tell me, how was this possible? Did you discover the two? No... it was the nurse on night-duty. What a terrible business. Nobody is safe from violence or murder. But why? Why two innocent men? We can't change it anymore, my dear child. Your husband's death and that of Dr. Henry is a loss for science. Please, sir, let us... let us not talk about it anymore. - You have to calm down. - l am so- l know it is hard, but think of tomorrow. Here, child, this tea will do you good. - Thank you. - Drink it all, and then the world will look different again. Thank you. We will find a way. Trust us. l would suggest you go to your hotel. Yes, you are right. Humphrey, what happened? Let me go, l am afraid. Stop! Don't move! Humphrey, take her away. - There is something wrong here. - But what are we going to do now? Go in, what else? - Yes, please. - ls Lord Kinsley at home? - Yes, but he is resting. - lt is extremely urgent, - we must talk with him. - Fine, then follow me, please. You too. Normally, l shouldn't bother my brother, but you are so nice. Please wait here. There is somebody to talk with you. Hello, what can l do for you? - Yes, we want... - l believe, we made a mistake. lf you want to see Lord Kinsley, l am Lord Kinsley. - lt is still a mistake. - l'm very sorry. Sorry, but we better leave now. Goodbye. Yes, goodbye. Help! Help! Hello. l've heard a lot of interesting things about you. Really? Then come and tell me. Well, especially about your success with women. That arouses my curiosity. You are also supposed to be an expert on some sort of stones.
