Double that amount for Maths and Science. ls it over? After this we'll have to send him to Trichur for coaching. That will be more expensive. Do you remember any of this? One more person younger to you by 15 years is also going to come. Whether it is male or female... ...the same expense has to be repeated for that too. lsn't this accounting enough between us? Don't you have anything else to tell him? - What else is there to say? - You eat. Do you have tuition in the evening? Yes. Maths tuition. Should l tell mother to send auto for you? - No need. l'll come in bus. - Okay, you go. - Pranav! - Hello, Vivek! Did you get scolding from father yesterday as you got late? No. Father came still more lately. Do not urinate here. l could not control it. With this crooked mind you want to go for meditation. For that you want one more days leave. Aren't you scratching your head and trying to make it bald... ...before time for that? Not possible. ln a week you want to meditate for five days. This arrogance is not correct for a peon, Cletus. Cletus can go. Father, when l was coming here that... ...Tesse teacher told me one thing. A prohibited act is being done by a responsible man. Then how can we scold the children? l didn't understand. ln bold letters it is written that no one should urinate. But you urinated there. l think Tesse teacher saw that. l don't think at this age... ...l'll have the eagerness to do that which is prohibited. - Have you heard of Prostate gland? - Yes. Have you heard of the infection that comes to that? Prostitution. Sinner! That is something else. My problem is l can't control urinating. - l'm fed up of passing urine. - ls it only this much? l'll tell about this to Tesse teacher now itself. Devil! You want tomorrow one day's leave. lsn't it? - Take it. - Okay. People like this also come. To catch on to urine. My God! Why this eagerness to kill? Eagerness to kill Eagerness to kill. The soft tone of this music. Mother! You go. l'll take the medicines and eat. Did you eat your medicines? Don't forget that this is a brave act at the age of forty. Mother! What are you searching for? My specs. Your forgetfulness, mother. Have some beetroot. You always have beetroot. l have a doubt. Don't your parent's get salary from their job? We can't eat cash. - The problem there is busy. - Why is it like that? The minute it is dawn they both are in hurry burry. lt is really a Tom and Jerry game. Then it is easy to cut beetroot. That is good. My mother is a housewife. She has to just supervise the servant. That is good. For supper she'll ask Daddy. How is today's special? lf daddy says good, she'll be proud. - lf he says bad? - She'll abuse the servant. - Good afternoon, teacher! - Good afternoon. Last week l gave you a CD. Didn't she resemble this teacher? Nonsense. Are you making fun of the teacher? This is not that. l'm sure. Yes. l heard it secretly. Daddy was telling mother. Even though he is cruel, he doesn't lie. l had so much trouble in stealing that. You come. That is correct. Father! Boys! Pranav, Vivek. Am l right? There is only one way to remember names. ln between you call out the name and address some one. Two years back l was your teacher. So l know ln exam both of you will get high distinction. lsn't it? Do you still use this? When l get wheezing, Father. - Shall we go? - Are you in hurry? - A bit. - Go. Come. Pranav, l'll give you a surprise day after tomorrow. What? - Day after tomorrow is Sunday. - Yes. There is Malayalam class of Shailaja teacher. Pranav. First three letters PRA. Another one. First letter PRA. Did you see this? A fetus of seven months. At this stage we can know whether it is male or female. That is if we want. Cigarette smoking won't harm the baby in the computer. Thank God! One like that is alive in this room. - ln my stomach. - ls it? lt is unable to enter the room. Have you not slept? - Has the boy slept? - l don't know. ln the morning till school you give him a lift in car. With that a father's responsibility is over. ln between a father can look into his other matters. l'll see. Not only in the case of son. For some days you'll be lying idle after child birth. l'll look after your mother's needs also correctly. l'll do everything for the happiness of the wife who... ...goes off to sleep and snores the minute she lies down. Go to sleep. She is reading news paper. Put off the light. Good morning teacher's father! Kumbakaran has come. Where are Ravan and Vibheshan? Morning itself l got a nose cut. Sit down. Time is 10:15. - Where are the others? - They are coming, teacher. Have you come? Sit down. Where did we stop yesterday's story? - That old man. What is his name? - Baran Lola. Some Ruchi. - ls it Chavarpu Ruchi? - Rogue! What did you say? lt is Bara Ruchi. We are studying about Bara Ruchi. Repeat it. Bara Ruchi. - Bara Ruchi. - Yes, Bara Ruchi. - You are getting spoilt. - ls it paining? - Get lost. - Okay, okay. Even though he is highly learned he didn't know which... ...was the most important sloka in Ramayan. Bara Ruchi was confused totally. ln that state one night Bara Ruchi lied down under a tree one night. ln that tree lots of gods were residing. At night when gods started to talk between themselves... ...Bara Ruchi heard that. You know what they said? Nearby a lower caste woman had given birth to a baby girl. This Brahmin who is lying here is going to marry that girl. That is what they said. Hearing that Bara Ruchi got shocked. How can he being a pure Brahmin marry a low caste girl? That is never possible. Bara Ruchi decided that. What did he do? He went straight to the king. He told the king a big lie. What was that lie? lf the baby girl of that lower caste woman remains alive... ...this kingdom will get destroyed when she turns three years old. Due to that the baby should be killed as soon as possible. She is a small girl. lsn't it a crime to kill that? lsn't it? So what did the king do? He decided to make a hole on her forehead. By tying a rope to that he decided to make a hole on land... ...and put her inside that... The parent's of this child cried like anything. But there was no use. The servants of the king made hole on the forehead of the child. - Did that child die? - Don't be in a hurry. She slipped inside that hole little by little. Have you come, dear? Come. This is the one about whom l told you. Do you know who she is? She is Pratibha. Pratibha! An old style name. How does she look? Super. This is the PRA about whom l told you. Pranav, Pratibha. Both names start with PRA. But l don't understand one thing. She is studying in government school that too in Malayalam medium. Why does she need to come to Shailaja teacher for tuition? lt is we who need Malayalam tuition. That is what l told you. Her father is in such a job where he has to work on Sunday's too. Seeing him he has an eccentric look. l have come here once before. l don't know whether you remember Shailaja. lt was some years back. l remember very well. lt is not some years, Bala. lt is 18 years back. When my mother died. But that time also you had this beard and Kurta, Balendran. Hear this, father. Balendran was the hero of the studious students in college. He used to sing, draw, write, and act. He had all this talent. To be precise a ten headed Ravan. Then he eloped with one Uma who was studying for Malayalam degree. l also remember the story of your marrying her. Where is she? Her mother. There are lots of stories. l'll tell. Like the love stories which you read in some weekly's. lt can't be said so quickly. Now l only have her as mine. That is the end of the story. You come here, smart girl. Pratibha! lsn't it? What better name can a genius's daughter have then this? lsn't it? Are you hungry? Shalini, give her something to eat - You come. - Go. Come. l'm her father and mother now. lt is six years now since Uma died. lt started as a small headache. She spent time in hospitals for 1-11l2 years. What ever was possible treatment was there it was done. But... For some days we'll be in this Shailaja's neighborhood. l have taken a small house on rent. But l have to go for work on Sunday's too. l'm hesitant to leave her alone in that rented house on holidays. You know, time is very bad. This is a place where l don't have any relatives or friends. - lt is then that l remembered you. - Good thing. At least that way you remembered me. You need not worry for any thing, Balan. During Sundays some children come here to study Malayalam. So called modern families children. l have no problem. With them she can also be there listening to stories. - Teacher! - This is one guy in that. What is it, Vivek? What is there in the vessel? Today is my birthday. Mummy sent this. lt is sweet porridge. Thank you! Many, many happy returns of the day. Thank you, teacher. Doesn't this Malayalam teacher still... ...know how to say birthday wish in Malayalam? lt is not that l don't know. lf l say that also in Malayalam, he'll consider me as an alien. lsn't it? Do you think he doesn't think of you like that now?. This is sweet porridge. lt is Vivek's birthday. He was asking whether she can stay there at day time on Sundays. She is first in everything in class. She sings and dances. They were praising her. l found out in detail who was she and from where she had come. While we are meeting a person for the first time that is the procedure. - Do you have tuition today? - Yes. What kind of a person is this Malayalam teacher? Does she know how to teach? She is a good teacher. She'll tell us lots old stories. Here mother tries to tell him mythological stories forcibly. But he won't listen. lt is good that we put him in this Malayalam tuition. He'll at least learn to abuse us at old age in Malayalam. No use of listening to stories. You must get good mark. - Okay. - Go. You are a great singer. You said you are very brave. Now what happened? - Sing. - Should l sing? You must sing. All of us are waiting to hear Pratibha's song. Sing. lt is not a new song. lt is an old one. This is my father's favorite song. On top of the mango tree this parrot is sitting looking at the clouds. Come down from the top and give me a small peck. On top of the mango tree this parrot is sitting looking at the clouds. Come down from the top and give me a small peck. There are dreams which are floating in my eyes. Come on the tip of my lips and blossom as a smile. Come on the tip of my lips and blossom as a smile. On top of the mango tree this parrot is sitting looking at the clouds. Come down from the top and give me a small peck. l can see all the beauties of this world on the dimples of your cheeks. l can see the dreams floating in your eyes like clouds on sky. ln the wide spread sky the sun is spreading its rays. The moon comes out of the cloud... ...as if a beauty is looking out of the window. ln my dreams your face is flying high. On top of the mango tree this parrot is sitting looking at the clouds. Come down from the top and give me a small peck. The beauty of the nature is spread all over. When the cool breeze touched me l had a tinkling feeling. When you talk the voice is so sweet like honey. l can hear the sound of your anklets in the air. Will you continue to come in my thoughts like this? On top of the mango tree this parrot is sitting looking at the clouds. Come down from the top and give me a small peck. With the music of veena you sing like flowing water. There are dreams which are floating in my eyes. There are dreams which are floating in my eyes. On top of the mango tree this parrot is sitting looking at the clouds. Come down from the top and give me a small peck. Before Unni's exams my maternity leave will start. For some days l'll be able to pay attention to him. ln office everyone is making joke of my pregnancy. The interest of seeing second delivery after 15 years. ls he still against this child? First l also thought of not having this child, mother. Not because l'm scared of people's mockery. lf even l don't pay attention to Unni during exam, he'll become lazy. He'll lose mark. Even Unni's behavior has changed now. l feel he is getting detached from me. After sometime you'll also leave. Then l'm scared l won't have anyone of mine. Then l'll become totally lonely in this flat. My prayer is that this should be a baby girl. l can talk to her. Sometimes l can tell her my sorrows and cry. l'll have a company. Fourteen years of difference. That is a real difference. Anita must be now 38-39 years old? No, no. She is 40 years old. l told her to abort it. She is not listening to me. Without even scanning he has decided that it is a baby girl. For help her mother has come over. The problem is not in gender. A normal delivery at this age. lt is impossible. To whom are you showing? Doctor Anne Philip. She also said the same thing. ls it that dirty bitch? For the first 10 years of our marriage... ...she kept saying we will have a child just now. She'll do the needful. She is also like my wife. Till now she also doesn't have a child. Do you know that? Not only her. ln my knowledge some 3-4 gynecologists don't have child. l think it must be due to the curse of doing abortions. lt is not that. They are always talking and studying about this. Daily they keep seeing this only again and again. Due to which they must have lost interest in sex. Fallopian tube, Ovary, Vagina. After hearing all this their mood will go. Hearing all this we lost our mood. Then what is there to tell about others? Did you also lose your mood? Not that. l was just thinking. Your problem is that you don't have a child. My problem lies in thinking about the coming child. lf this thing was not there, what will happen to us in this tension? That is correct. Get two more large pegs. What else? You finish that. Have you selected a name for the baby? l have selected two names. Kshama and Daya. Which one do you like in this? Both these are girls names. Are you sure it will be a sister? Grandma told me that it'll be a girl. Due to that only you have become more beautiful. You tell father not to scold the child too much. The child might get scared. Mother! - Father! Father! - What is it? What happened? What happened? Make her sit there. Slowly. What happened? When she removed the plug from iron box she received a shock. Do you still make her iron your uniform? Can't you do all this? With this stomach what all can she do? She has to look after my needs and your needs. You are no more a child. You do some of the works yourself. Don't trouble mother unnecessarily like this. Now another child is going to come in this house. Thank god nothing happened. Go and get some water. Go. How do you feel now?. - Nothing. - Go and lie down inside. Slowly. Father Alfred Jerry Manramchadi Kunnel. That is my full name. l always like to be called with full name. l don't like if any one shortens it. l mean pet name. Many people have understood your weakness. So they are calling you with another name. - Do you know that? - No. lsn't it black berry phone which you carry secretly? - Yes. - Berry father. lf you don't know by now, you listen to me. That is your secret name. Jerry Father. Berry Father. l hope these useless children don't address me in any other name. She understood. Pranav! Pranav! How fast you walk? Yesterday l saw you in town. With your friends. Without uniform you looked so cute. What is this? ls it a mobile? Please, father! Don't complaint this. lt is father's mobile phone. l have kept it in switched off mode. When father bought a new one he gave me the old one. - Please, father! Please! - Okay, you go. But remember my mercy. What is it? Don't you have anything to study? By putting on music you are just dancing. Are you not ashamed? Do and study. He is dancing. ls it true what you are saying? Promise. My mother told me. Some big shot is buying that house. Haven't you heard of smart city? lt is that or something like that. What ever it is. One thing is for sure. Shailaja teacher is going to sell that house and plot. Shailaja teacher, sisters and her father are going to some village. As they don't have money they didn't get married. From this they will get some money. That is for sure. After exam we must find a new Malayalam tutor. That is what mummy's tension is. - l have given a photo. - To whom? Shailaja teacher? With that l have given my mobile number too. Whom did you give all this? ls it to Pratibha? This phone was given to me by father for an emergency. From one week l have been hiding it. l hope at least she sends an sms. They look like local people who use public phone. That girl would have never even touched a cell phone. My god! l'm 10 minutes late. Mummy is going to kill me. We'll see later on. Bye! lt is an unknown number. That means... Wait. Mother is saying this is a baby girl. lt seems seeing my face it is obvious. What do you feel? The excitement of finding the answer for puzzle is gone. That too to think at the age of 45 and admire. Once l asked you before whether all men are like this. For that you gave me a sarcastic answer which l have not forgotten. Even then l'll ask you. Why are you always so angry with me? You try to go to sleep. Every day like an imposition you... ...keep asking the same question. Anyone is bound to get bored. Not only questions. Everything. l'll sleep. Else l'll act like sleeping and lie down. You can take dirty CD's from almairah and go to watch in TV. ln this modern life l thought there is bound to be some problem. Thinking like that l pacified myself during early days. Now it is becoming unbearable. There is fire inside me. There is a boy in this house who is... ...old enough to search his father's table drawer. Do you remember that? Shut up and sleep or get out. You don't give me peace of mind even for a single day. The age to reform me is gone. You mind your business. lf that is not possible, you get out of this room. So this is the last day of your studies in this institution. l'm proud to be the principal... ...such bright and wonderful students like you. As you know our institution... ...has many great teachers as your mentors. And l'm sure that all of them have done a great job... ...in fulfilling our dreams. That is to get cent percent distinction this year. He has made it by heart. Do remember one thing my dear students. Your study leave is for nothing other than to study. To study only. Because there won't be a second chance for you to perform better. - May god bless you all! - Thank you, father. l would have done that job. Why are you doing all the jobs alone? What for did l come? Due to that l could understand one thing. Due to hectic work l forget all this. lf you need blouse or bra, why don't you tell me? Who is going to see how the under garments are? How costly it is to buy these things newly? What is it, mother? Scissor. You are so forgetful. l want to tell you one matter. By the time Unni's exams are over it'll be time for your delivery. lf we go to our native place, we can see good doctors. The expense will also be less. You will have a change. You'll get some fresh air also. That will make the child healthier. l'm also thinking only about that. l won't get permission. Even then we must go. Let Unni's exams be over. You get the phone. Dial Shashi's number for me. There also l have two grand children. That elder boy is very naughty. l can hear his voice and l can tell him about our arrival. Without consulting my husband we need not tell that now. You dial the number and give me. l'll decide whether to tell him or not. Mother! l used to tell everyone that... ...it is shame for we Malayalees to keep a tuition teacher for Malayalam. lf l continue to say this more, my income will stop. That is why l stopped saying this. When big matters come small things fall down. After this we won't be able to see teacher. - Will we be able to see? - May be. When you see me on the way doesn't forget to stop the car and say hello. Teacher, did that girl who sings song also went away? l think you liked that song very much, Vivek. Poor thing. Pratibha is the smartest girl that l have come across. Her 8th std. exams are going on. After that she and her father will leave. That girl said she wanted to see you both. Did you meet her? She asked me for your address. l have given it to her. l have given both your phone numbers too. Okay, then. Study well and write your exams very well. ln Malayalam you must score full marks. - All the best! - Okay, teacher. You fool l'm sure that girl doesn't have a mobile of her own. We are not able to understand the message. Leave that. We must at least confirm that it was sent by her. - How to do that? - lt is too easy. We can call back the same number from which that message came. Else we'll send back a message saying who are you? May be she took away her father's cell for some time. lf l call back or send message, only he'll get it. Then what? He'll come home. Tell my parents everything. They are waiting to find a reason. They will kill me and throw me into this water. For that you need not flirt in phone. lf he picks it up, you cut it. Then you make the call. Take it. No need. Many of the rape cases that we see in paper... ...are being caught through the mobile number. Then you come. Anita, get my shoes. Give it here. What a problem? How do you feel now mother? lt is better. Even then l feel very sleepy. l don't feel like waking up. Your medicine is getting over. l'll buy that too. Anyway l'll be going to hospital. There will be a big queue for check up. Mother, do you need slippers? l don't need anything. After check up you come back soon. l'll visit the doctor and come back soon. Do you want anything from outside? Study well. Stop seeing TV and making phone calls. lf take some trouble now, you'll get result. Have you taken that card? Are you shocked? ls this your house? This is the first time l got into lift. lt is really nice. - Why are you not inviting me inside? - Come. Where are your parents? l came today as they'll be having holiday today. My parents will come soon. Where is Vivek's house? ls that also a flat? ln that room my grand mother is there. She is sleeping. We can talk slowly. lf grand mother wakes up, there will be problem. lsn't this you? Are they your parents? Your mother is very beautiful. You have so many toys. lt is very beautiful. Very interesting. ls all this yours? l have to go back soon. Do know one thing? l came here without my father's knowledge. We came to my music teacher Kalyani madam's house. We came there to inform that we'll be leaving here. There is a small passage opposite this. That is where Kalyani teacher's house is. Father dropped me there and went saying he'll be back in half an hour. l cut that half an hour into two. Fifteen minutes there. Fifteen minutes here. How is my brain? The bell is ringing. Don't go. My parents will kill me. Please! Why? For showing these toys to me? - l'll meet them and go. - Pratibha, please! Don't go now. My parents will kill me. For sometime you get inside this. l'll just close the door. Else they'll kill me. Please! Please! Quick. Come. Where is Anita? There is lot of crowd in hospital. At least it'll take three hours to see the doctor. l came back. Why to waste a holiday unnecessarily? Sit down. Sorry, sorry. What is this? Sit down. Sit there. Where you reading or sleeping? l was ringing the bell for so long. Are you studying well? You must study well and become a smart guy like father. What a problem is this? That is also over. This is the usual here. - There is no gas in soda maker. - No problem. We'll use cold water. lt is not like that when a person has come from outside. Dear, come here. You do downstairs and get one soda. Cross the road carefully. No need. Let him study. He'll come just now. You go fast. Buy the 2 liter one. Let us sit inside. We'll finish before my wife comes. Come. Brother! Brother! l need 2 liter of soda. Hello, come here. Pratibha! Pratibha! Pratibha! Please! l didn't do it purposely. Believe me. When l went to the shop l had put the key in my pocket. l lost it either on lift or some where on the way. You don't get scared. Pratibha! Pratibha! By the time the check up is over you said you'll come with the car. There are lots of auto rickshaws in city. Now in holidays you have started drinking at home also with friends. With this stomach l was roaming in the shops and on the way. Dickrew's wife saw that. She must have seen that staggering friend of yours. Now everyone has got a new gossip to discuss. You need not think about our undelivered baby. But there is a son of ours in this house who is going... ...to appear for his 10th std. exam. Are you listening to me? The day Unni's exam will be over. That day l'll go to my native place. Let him also know what native place is and what humanity is. Let me also breathe in fresh air. Don't remain awake for too late. Your eyes and face have swollen up. After exam we'll go to our native place. Let your small sister take birth by seeing native place. Then we can bring her here afterwards. What do you say? What is it? Come here. lf we stay there for some days, your wheezing will improve. That is what your grandma also told. Why do you look unhappy? Don't you like my coming near you and talking to you now days? Your small sister is imprisoned inside here. She is in a peaceful place. She need not know anything. She is no complaint or anger on any one. She is in a small darkness. Once she comes out on this concrete prison... ...like all other women she'll also start to face sorrow and problems. But she'll be a company to your mother. lt is better rather than to be a prisoner alone. lt'll be like in a prison to be together. She'll also learn the happiness of togetherness. Now what shall we do? Did you see all over properly? l took the money from my pocket in the shop to buy soda. lt must have fallen some where there. ln that hurry that too in that crowded place. Even if the key had fallen there, l'll not get it. l'm sure of that. lt is gone. That girl is inside that. Think something practically. There is one way. ln our golden bazaar on top of the cassette shop there is a... ...shop where they make duplicate keys. When l lost my cycle key l solved my problem by going there. But there is a problem. Your mother is on leave. Your grand mother will also be there for full time. First a guy from there will have to come to make the key. lf he comes like that and opens the door... ...if that girl is okay then no problem. Now when you call she is not replying. ln that case she might have died inside. lt doesn't have to be like that only. May be she is silent from inside as she doesn't want to make problem. ln that case doesn't she need sufficient oxygen? Let us do one thing. No one knows that she came to your house. So there won't be any problem for the time being. Daily you check the news paper. l'll try to find out tactfully where she lives. Particularly notice two things in paper. First thing whether there is news that she is missing. Second thing if there is any father's photo who has... ...committed suicide as his child went missing. Shailaja teacher told me that day that he is very fond of her. We'll find some way. lf l get any news, l'll ring you on your mobile. Else no need. Mobile is very risky. Now it has become easy for the police to tap it. Unnecessarily l'll also get caught. l'll call you in your land phone. No need. l'll come directly. That is safe. - ls your grand mother still there? - Yes. l think she is sure to become a problem. ls there any scope to drive her away from there? Not required. l just asked like that. While handling a case we must make the entire angle safe. This has become like Cinderella's story. Only the slippers are remaining. Best proof. Give it here. Your grand mother had a problem before marriage. On seeing grilled stone she'll break it at once and eat. ln those days for old people and pregnant women hot... ...water is prepared on the front of the house in a stove. So coal and brick will always be there in front of the house. By breaking all that... ...your grand mother will eat happily without others knowledge. Then your grand father came to marry her. He was a big shot with lot of respect and status there. Everyone was scared about hiding this matter and getting her married. These are stories which mother has told me by herself. On first night father told mother that l have brought a gift for you. He told her to see under the bed. On first night a rich husband is giving a gift. Mother looked at the gift. - On looking what was it? - What was it? A full burnt brick. lt is not a story to laugh. My cruel father made my mother eat half of it. To take revenge for hiding this fact and getting her married to him. Poor mother dies when she was young. ln those days men were so cruel. Even though times have changed have men changed that much? Can we say that all men are alike, mother? There are women who will refuse to eat brick. See that Dickrew's wife. lt may be a vulgar example. That Shailaja teacher who was taking Malayalam tuition for Unni. l have seen her just once. She must be my age. She is unmarried. Even then she is a powerful woman. She can live as she wants. What happiness? Even then l feel men are near about the same everywhere. Then what about Mahatma Gandhi, mother? Who knows about that poor Kasturba's state? Once you are caught that all. Unni! Pick up the phone. He has picked up - Hello! - Hello! - ls it mother? - No, it is Unni. ls it you, Unni? Give the phone to grand mother. No need. Tell her the matter. Nothing, Unni. Our Appu fell down in bath room. ln left hand there is injury. There is nothing to worry. He is lying near me after taking medicine. - Hello! - Do you want orange? Tell this matter to your grandma. l'll call later on. Tell her that there is nothing to worry. Okay. There is no urgency here. - Did you hear? - Yes. - Are you studying well? - Yes. lf you get A+ in everything you'll get a gift from uncle's side. - Did you hear? - Yes. Tell grandma there is nothing to worry. Okay. Okay, uncle. - ls your grand mother still there? - Yes. l think she is sure to become a problem. ls there any scope to drive her away from there? Who was that Unni? lt was Shashi uncle from native place. What did he say? That... He said not to inform grandma. What is it? What did Shashi tell? - Appu fell in bathroom. - God! What am l hearing this? What did he say? What did brother tell? Our Appu fell in bathroom and then... Then? Rest l could not hear. - l'll phone and find out. - Wait, mother. Don't get tensed. Let me see. lt'll be nothing. Shashi uncle didn't call from home. lt was from some hospital. He told me to tell you that they are all there. What to do? Shashi doesn't even have a mobile or anything. Mother, where are you going? l'll go there and come back. After hearing this l have no peace of mind. Nothing would have happened to him. Even if you want to go... ...after Ranjith comes l'll tell him to drop you in car. All that is not needed. He'll be tired coming from office. No need. l'll go in bus. There won't be anything. lt is sometime since l saw them. Mother! Mother! Do you have money with you? l always have some amount in my hand. Unni! Unni, you go with mother till bus stand. Dear, don't stop medicinal oil bath. Go, go. l know that it is the age when teeth and nails grow for men. Uncle had told you particularly in phone to tell grandma not to come. lsn't it? There is only a small wound in Appu's hand. He had told not to get tensed. lsn't it? lsn't it? ln spite of that my son coolly told a lie. That too looking at the face of mother and grand mother. My Unni! What has happened to you? Look at my face. lf l tell this matter to your father... ...don't you know what will happen? - Tell me what will happen? - Anita! The boy in the lift misbehaved with our Dickrew's daughter. lf you want, you come. There is a big commotion in third floor. Unni, you sit here and study. l'll see and come. As you said she may be standing inside that silently... ...as she doesn't want to create problem. ln that case doesn't she want sufficient oxygen? lt is how long since you have been doing this thing? Will you misbehave? lndecent guy. Come, come. He should be thought a lesson. You'll take money from us and misbehave with our ladies? Please! Don't do anything to me. How long you have been working as a lift man? Actually what happened? l saw with my two eyes. When the lift opened they both were hugging each other. Oh God! l can't believe this. Hello, Mrs. Ranjith! Come, come. What is the use of crying now?. Don't hit me any more. Pratibha! Pratibha! Pratibha! Can you hear me? Come here with us. Don't trouble me any more. l'll not repeat this. Pratibha! Pratibha! Brother, where is the house of Balachandran? Ask that shop keeper. Go from the left side. lt is the third house. Come, what happened? l found out. lt is a small rented house. No one has any idea from where they came and to where they went. The house is locked up with a big lock. Who is that? lt is me Pranav's mother. Vivek. l came to clear a doubt in maths. Come here. There is still time for it to start smelling. ln that case some ants and all. Oh my god! Look. See here. What will we do? Aye, Pranav's mother! lt has been some days since he looks scared. Now suddenly he has fainted. You don't be tensed. Come. Particularly there is nothing wrong. For some days you change him to a place of fresh air. l mean to your native place or something. Once his exams are over... ...and school closes we are planning to go to our native place. Make that trip earlier. One thing the polluted atmosphere of the city. Then the closed flat life. Over that the exam fears. Anyone will get tensed. For the time being if you change him, he'll get relief. Continue the same medicine at present. lf he has severe problem, he can use this tablet. Okay. Most important is not that. You take one day leave. You drop him in your native place. lf possible, today itself. You can bring him back a day before exam. Till then he can remain relaxed. lf you remain alone for some days, it'll be a relief to you also. We'll go, Unni. On reaching there all this problem of yours will be over. Come with us. - What happened, sir? - You come with me. Mother! Come on. Open it. Mother! There is light sun light and shade everywhere. There is light breeze blowing on top of the paddy field. There is light sun light and shade everywhere. There is light breeze blowing on top of the paddy field. The yellow flowers on the way... Welcome you to this place of harmony. Far away on the sky l can see rainbow. There are thousands of swings hanging from trees. There are coconut trees all around. There is light sun light and shade everywhere. There is light breeze blowing on top of the paddy field. There are lots of boats floating in the water. As the rowing speed was less the breeze gave a helping hand. There are lots of boats floating in the water. As the rowing speed was less the breeze gave a helping hand. There are lots of plants in water which come behind the boat. Our eyes float here and there like fish to see the scenery. Behind the black water many of our memories are hiding. That cool breeze is freshening up all those memories. There is light sun light and shade everywhere. There is light breeze blowing on top of the paddy field. All the old stories are hiding below this black water. We must look out sharply to find them. Brother-in-law! You are busy. You have to return back soon. ls this what you are going to say as usual? Today l'm very tired. l'll be returning only tomorrow early morning. What a wonder? Come, come. Are you fine, dear? By eating all the fish you have become really fat. Take this and keep inside. Let us go inside. Brother-in-law, can l get tender coconut water? Sure. l'll arrange for everything if you are not leaving today. - Where is my grandson? - He is in the car. - How are your studies going on? - Not bad. l'm not able to open this door. Come. Anita! Doesn't he eat anything? Look at his health. lt is not because of his eating. He is tensed about his exams. lt is not tiredness. He is ashamed of lying to you grandma. lsn't it? Did you see, friend? l was hurt only this much. Don't forget that he is your brother. Come, come. Did you eat extra today, aunty? No, dear. There is a small baby inside my stomach. - That is your sister. - Won't it feel short of breath? No. ln the floating sun light we can see the boats going. - You have this. - You eat this. Take this away. Brother-in-law, have this fish. - Nice one. - Have it. Thorn. l have passed urine. You go and urinate. Only once in a while l'm able to eat such tasty fish. You eat the whole thing. lt is a pleasure to drink toddy. There are lots of plants in water which come behind the boat. Our eyes float here and there like fish to see the scenery. Behind the black water many of our memories are hiding. That cool breeze is freshening up all those memories. There is light sun light and shade everywhere. There is light breeze blowing on top of the paddy field. All the old stories are hiding below this black water. We must look out sharply to find them. All the old stories are hiding below this black water. We must look out sharply to find them. There is a boy in this house who is old enough to search... ...his father's table drawer. Do you remember that? Where is the key? So many ants are there. Give me something, madam. Madam! - Geeta! - What is it? Yesterday also you came. Why do you come here daily? - Madam, l'm hungry. - Dear, give him some change. You are fully pregnant. He might curse you, if you say no. ln my small purse you'll find change. Appu! Get that small purse of grandma. Take it, aunty. Where is Unni brother, aunty? He is sitting on the pond side and studying. Let him study something. Don't you have exams? Go and study. Beggar family. Mother! Which is this key? lt was in your purse. Damn my memory! This is our Unni's... - Where is Unni? - There. Dear Unni! Close your eyes. l'll give you one thing. - l don't want it. - Don't say like that. While coming from your house... ...there is one thing which l brought with me unknowingly. Close your eyes. Grandma! Grandma! This key. That girl must have... Unni! Stop there, Unni. Unni, stop. Unni! - Unni! - Brother! What is it? Unni! Father, something has happened to Unni. - You come fast. - Where? Come, fast. Unni! Unni! Unni! He has fallen. Move away. - Unni! - What happened? - Brother! - Move away. - Brother! - Unni! Look son. Grandma told us everything. Nothing happened to that friend of yours. Promise. Yes, Unni. Before l could tell everything what all did you do? Did you get tensed for this? Now only l came to know about it. The mistake was mine. l forgot that the key was in my purse. Grandma, how did that girl come out of almairah? lt is really nice. Why are you not inviting me inside? Come. Where are your parents? l came today as they'll be having holiday today. Do you know one thing? l came here without my father's knowledge. We came to my music teacher Kalyani madam's house. We came there to inform that we'll be leaving here. - lt must be them. - Don't go now. My parents will kill me. Please, get in. Sorry, sorry. What is this? You go downstairs and get one soda. Let us sit inside. We'll finish before my wife comes. Come. Before he brings soda, let us each have one as dry. Give the thing. Don't be scared. Come. Don't be scared. lsn't this original? Didn't you see that seal? lt is very good. Come fast. Don't be scared. You come. - l didn't take my slippers. - You can take that later on. Come. Go. Go. Even if it happened unknowingly... ...it is good that l brought that key with me. Why? lf l had given you that key, you'll again put... ...someone inside that and lock. Either your yet to be born sister or your mother. Due to bad luck it could be me too. There is light sun light and shade everywhere. There is light breeze blowing on top of the paddy field. The yellow flowers on the... ...way welcome you to this place of harmony. Far away on the sky l can see rainbow. There are thousands of swings hanging from trees. There are coconut trees all around. l have selected a name for baby. Will you keep that? - ls it Kshama or Daya? - Both that is not needed. You tell me. What ever you select we'll keep that name. - My name starts with PRA. - Yes. We'll keep a name which starts with the same letters. - ls it Priyamati? - No. lt is not good. - Prabha? - That is too bad. How about Pratibha? - Pratima? - lt is not Pratima. lt is Pratibha. The Bha of Bhasha. Pratibha! lt is a good name. lsn't it, Anita? Yes. Good name. Pratibha - EFG. - Half of eight. lf it is half of eight, how will O come? O. - Shadow of line. - No. l'll show you. God bless you. God bless you? You phone in this number and say. What is it? Why are you crying? lt was a puzzle. Wonderful puzzle. Cheriacha! Did you see his shyness? The characters depicted in this film... ...is similar to all Malayalees living and dead. This is not at all a coincidence.
