It's all right. Calm down. It's OK. I'm just going to take a look, all right? Just... OK. Easy. Whoa. Whoa. All right. I'm going to go for it, all right? Easy. OK... all right, come on. Come on. ( straining ) I'm just, I'm just helping. No, come on. Oh... girl, he's OK. No. Come on, boy. Come on... come on. Twister! Twister, he's beautiful. You got to see him. ( thunder booming ) Easy. All right. Easy, boy. Easy. I'll be right back. You got yourself a beautiful boy. ( whinnying ) Well, I'll be. That's the quickest I've ever seen a foal up. I think you got yourself a runner. Twister? Virginia? Daddy? Stay here, Caroline. Dad, where's Virginia? Virginia! Hey, boy, hey. Virginia, what... Twister just gave birth. I can see that. Dad... Twister's... well, she... ( sobbing ) Look, Dad, I'm sorry. Virginia, the next time that you have one of your premonitions, or feelings or whatever, and it involves you running out into a thunderstorm at 4:00 in the morning, you are going to be camping out in your room for a month. (horn beeping ) Oh... hell. - 'Morning, Ford, Virginia. - Blake. Lit up pretty here last night. Yeah, it was, uh... it was a rumble, all right. Sorry about the mare. She was getting on in years. Hard to believe she waited so long to give me a foal. Appreciate you two taking charge... 32 hands on the payroll, all with their heads up their butts. Pardon the French, Virginia. - You're pardoned. - There you go. What's this, Blake? It's for a newborn's immune system. Yeah, I know what colostrum is. It's for the foal. It thinks Virginia's his mama. - I just don't want... - Blake, we must get moving. The race starts in less than an hour. I have to register the contestants, brief the vets, review the ground rules... Don't get your undies in a bundle. No race in this county is gonna start without me. All right. Well, gotta go. Virginia, think you can come up with a name for that foal? Sure. Why don't you two join us in town for the finish... we're gonna have one big celebration. Mm-hmm. Cross your fingers for Darrow. Cross your fingers and hope he gets lost. Virginia... What? Darrow's a jerk... everyone knows it, except Caroline. And where do you think you're going? To feed the foal. Who else is going to do it? One of Blake's hands. Impossible... they all have their heads up their butts. Virginia... I don't want you to go near that horse. It's a foal, dad. Foal, horse... whatever. Whoa there, fella. Easy, boy. 'Morning, Lee. 'Morning, Virginia. Come here, boy. Got a mind of its own. Boy. Yeah? Hmm... yeah. Sunrise? Oh, it's ok. Nah, too wimpy. Dancer, Prancer... Nah, already taken. Sleepy, Grouchy, Dopey... ( whinnying ) Sorry. Just brainstormin'. Stormin'... Storm... Stormy! That's it, Stormy. You like that, don't you? Thought so. You got a way with horses, Virginia. ( rumbling ) Whoa! Easy... I got him, Virginia. Get away! Get away! Get off the trail. Get away. That's Darrow. He has a personality disorder. Keep your arms in! You ride like a chicken! Whoa, boy. Need a vet, now! Get a bag. Check the horse. But I'm here as as grand Marshall. How do you think you got that job, Huntington, - county elections? - Right. You worked him too hard. You're not at the halfway mark yet. I know the game plan, Dad. Then follow it... wait till the final stretch, then you run this nag into the ground if you must, understood? Oh, jeez... yeah. Come on... yah! Hurry up! Huntington... - what the hell are you doing? - The requisite physical overview. I'm checking for lameness, mucous membranes, back withers, attitude, muscle and anal tone, according to the checklist. Just take his pulse and get him on the road. Right. Anal tone. Come on, boy, come on. Come on. Heeyahh! Heeyahh! Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey! Whaaa! Hey! Come on, go. Yeah! That's my boy! Yeah! My dad might be watching. So what? I'm already an hour late. I'm sorry. What are you looking at? - Not much. You're putting me to sleep. Oh, yeah? Maybe this will wake you up. Looks kind of small. We got a bigger one for our sow Susie at the state fair. Saddle her up. We'll gave a go at it. Oh, wait. Didn't you guys eat her? I could whip your butt. Just let me know when your daddy lets you back on a horsey... I'll be waiting. Happy trails. I'll let you borrow my pig trophy, If it'll make you feel any better, Darrow. Wow. Virginia, you have a gift. It's from mom's recipe box. Oh, no thanks. - No thanks? - I don't feel like it right now. But you always liked lemon-meringue pie. I'm kind of full. She just wants to keep her girlish figure for Darrow. Uh, yeah, well, uh... Speaking of Darrow, in my opinion, he drives a little too fast. And you can tell him that, if he doesn't slow down, you won't be going anywhere with him, OK? And while we're on the subject, isn't that skirt a little bit too short? Ha, what, for lobster town? - What about your jeans? - Jeans? You used to criticize me for wearing them too much. The ones with holes in the butt. That's it. I'm finished. ( stammering ) What did I say now? Teenagers. So, how are the lobsters running, dad? Lobsters don't run... They crawl. Oh... Well, do you need any help on the boat? OK, what is it? Out with it. Well... I want to start riding again. Would you like some Ice cream with your pie? Answer's still no. May I please be excused? Yup. Ay- ay- ay... Give me patience. Sometimes I can't help myself. Things just pop out. You're the bratty little sister. That's your role in the family unit. I think you have a nice figure. I hope I look like you one day. That'll come sooner than you think. Don't push it. Why do you like Darrow? He's such a jerk. If he's such a jerk, then why hasn't he told dad about you feeding the foal. Well, he wouldn't do that... would he? Why do you even want to ride after what happened to Mom? I am glad Dad sold Twister to Blake. I hate that horse. It wasn't Twister's fault. Mom told us that at the hospital. I know that now. I knew that then. ( sobbing ) I just couldn't understand it. I still don't understand it. ( whistling ) Stormy! (whinnying ) Hey, boy. Here you go. Want to go for a ride tonight? Come on, boy. Go. (Virginia ): "Twister came through again. " "Best heart and lungs" "on any horse you could ever find. " "Our third Memorial Day victory in a row. " "Blake offered to buy her again. " "Ford told him he'd have to start looking for another wife. " "A wise man. " "I'm thinking we should have another baby. " "Haven't decided whether I should" "let Ford in on the scheme yet. " "Our surprise package arrived last night" "at 2:42 a. m.," "four days apart from Caroline. " "They told me the second one is always easier... they lied. " "14 hours in labour and she came out kicking and screaming. " "I think she's going to be a force of nature. " Easy... get hold of him, boys. Easy, fella, easy. Keep control of him. Jeez! We got him for you. Get on. Take him. Come on, let's see what you got. Come on. Let's go. Ha! Go easy, Darrow, go easy. Hey, come on. Let's go. Tighter, let's go. Go easy. Just work him slower, Darrow. Yeah! Come on. Hey! Come on. Hey. Whoa! Stormy, stop! Whoa, boy! Son of a... - Come here, boy. - You all right? - Easy, boy. - Get off me. Should have that horse shot. This is a western bit. Does he look like a barrel horse to you? You might as well have used barbed wire. You're right... he doesn't look like a barrel horse. He looks like a dead horse. It's all right. No one's going to hurt you. Ah, the, uh, the bottle-nosed deer fly. They're the worst. Excuse me? A wide splatter pattern, and, uh, very sticky. Ooh, you got a purple-winged, uh, kumquat there. Actually, I've got something that, uh... for that. Hold on. By-winged froghopper. You can always borrow this if you want. I mean... - Just in case you ever... - No, thanks. It's all right. - ... run into a yellow-nosed... - Needle pointer. So, where are you headed? Here... I'm training For Blake Raines... first week. Oh, he'll keep you busy. That's what I like. Jessie Eastwood. Ford Lofton. Nice to meet you. And you. Well, I suppose we'll be bumping into each other again. Yeah, it's, uh, it's a pretty small town. Everybody, uh, kind of knows everybody else. See you. Take care. Stormy update. Oh, don't worry. I didn't shoot him. Where is he? Sold him. Some sucker upstate. Just thought you might want to know. ( bell ringing ) Have a nice day. (whinnying ) Stormy! Stormy! Stormy! Stormy! Ahh... damn it! Your mom was really good at this Easter-egg making. Dad, a tiny hole is a lot better. Oh. And you have to be patient. That your outfit? Oh, no, Dad, I just came downstairs to help you with eggs. Then I'm going back up to change. ( giggling ) What's wrong with your sister, bythe way? Ah, Darrow's dad sold Stormy. Who's Stormy? Twister's colt... come on, she's been acting like it was hers ever since she delivered him. What do you mean, she's been acting like it's hers since she delivered him? - Well, um, ha... it's... - Well, then, what? Well, it's actually kind of funny... I got to go. Bye, Daddy. Hey, Mr. Lofton. Splendid day to be painting your eggs, huh? ( knocking ) Virginia? Hey. I heard about the horse. He was my horse. No, Virginia, he was Blake's horse. He would have died if I hadn't been there. Well, you don't know that. They never should've sold him. He should've stayed here... with me. Mom never would've let this happen. Virginia... I told you to stay away from the horse. You don't think I did that to punish you, do you? I don't know and I don't care! I miss her so much. So do I. We all do. But she's not coming back, Virginia. But we can keep her here... in our hearts. That way she'll never be gone. Don't you feel her in your heart? Hello... hello? Hi. Oh, hi. I'm Ford Lofton. Remember we met the other day? The entomologist. I was hoping, uh, hoping you'd have a few moments. Sure. What's on your mind? Well, I was, uh, I was wondering if maybe you needed some extra help around the stables over the next couple of months. Setting up fences, looking after tack, that sort of thing. I figured you for the type who already had a job. It's not for me. It's for my daughter, actually... Virginia. Does she ride? No, but she knows her way around horses pretty well. Well, I could probably use the help, but it's not really my call... you'll have to speak to Mr. Raines. Oh, I've already spoken to him, but he said that it was up to you. She's a great kid, she really is. She practically runs the household. See, she lost her mom about three years ago, so she's the one who's had to take up most of the slack. I'm sorry. Thanks... it's, uh, it's something you learn to deal with. Send her over. Great. I'll have her here this afternoon. Bye. I appreciate this. Thank you. She'll be so excited. Let me down! Let me down right now! I will not raise a daughter who doesn't talk, who doesn't smile and who feels sorry for herself 24 hours a day. It's my life. I can do whatever I want with it! Who's she, Dad? Her name is Jessie Eastwood. She's very nice. I'm sure she's delightful. OK, out you go. She's expecting you. What? Is it going to be the fireman's carry again? Git. Her hip is a little short. She's not getting under her back end. You'll have to teach her to overstride. Move. - Are you Virginia Lofton? - Yeah. Your dad didn't tell me you're a know-it-all. Just trying to point out a few particulars so that the horse moves better. You know how to saddle one up? Do I look like I was born yesterday? I'll tell you that in about 30 minutes. Take Princess in the barn. Grab a couple of helmets. Good horse. She has a soft mouth. I think we've already met. - When? - A couple of nights ago. You and your horse nearly landed on top of my car. My dad sold Twister to Mr. Raines after Mom's accident. I guess he just didn't want her around to remind him. He told me he never wanted to see me on a horse again. It's been almost three years. So, you ride at night? Stormy was my horse. Even though he didn't belong to me, I know that's how he felt, too. So, what do we do now? What you do is clean out the stables. Come on. Hey, Dad. Hello, Virginia. PB-and-J and a beer? You're missing out on some of the major food groups there, Dad. Uh-huh. So, um, how does toasted burrito sound? I think we got all the fixings. Mmm... yep. Here we are. So, how did work go today? Great. Miss Eastwood's real nice. You know, you were right about her. Mm-hmm. What did you do? Stuff around the barn, stable. Cleaned up, oiled some tack. That's it? That's about it. You didn't, by any chance, happen to do any riding, did you? I saw you, Virginia. I ride because I love it... and it reminds me of Mom. What's wrong with that? Look, I know she's not coming back! I know that! I'm not the cook in the family. No, no, no. This is, uh, this is fine. Good. Got it. # Oh, the future lies in the cradle # The future lies in the cradle # The future lies in the cradle # And the past lies in the ground # Oh the future lies in the cradle # The future lies in the cradle # The future lies in the cradle # And the past lies in the ground # We all leave a footprint # Here upon the earth I wonder # Will I leave # A footprint # Will I make a ripple # On the deep blue sea # On the blue sea would there be a ripple Sorry being down some farmer's driveway in the back seat of your car doesn't thrill me. You know what? Just drop it, OK? - Ooh. - Darrow, what are you doing? Let me out of the car. Use the door if you want. Ha, poor little Darrow didn't get any tonight, is that the problem? Tonight? What the hell is so different about tonight? Darrow, take off your glasses! Hey, what are you doing? Stop it. - Get off me. - You're not able to see the road! Darrow, let me out of the car. Darrow. Darrow, turn the lights on! Stop it! Changed your mind, huh? Get off me! - Ahh! - Oh God! ( screaming ) Ford, I'm sorry. Imagine that stupid farmer driving in the middle of the night on that bridge without his lights. Can you imagine that? Caroline... Caroline? Oh, my God. Mr. Lofton, Mr. Lofton. What? Is she... is she OK? She took a pretty good poke in the nose but it's a clean break. It should heal without any disfigurement. I've got her on Demerol. Want to keep her overnight. You sure that's it? She's going to be fine, Mr. Lofton. She's in a light sleep. Oh. Oh, Caroline. - Ooh! - Ow. Ooh, I'm so sorry. - That bad, huh? - Oh no, no, you look fine. Liar. Um, do you remember when Paul Cramer got hit in the nose with a baseball? - Yeah. - He looked awful... at first. He still looks terrible. Oh. Um, has Darrow called yet? Uh, I'm not sure, I... I don't think so. Oh, OK. Hello! Hi. Have you got a minute? Uh... Well, you've got three options: You could, number three, ask me to leave:, number two, we could talk on the porch; or you can invite me in. Hmm. Wow. Well, I'd never have thought of that. There's a technique to everything. How's Caroline? She's good. Darrow's a bit of a handful. More of a shovelful, I'd say. Where's Virginia? Oh, they're up there together. I'm gonna keep my distance. They're getting along. She's a good kid, you know. You should let her ride, Ford. That's between me and her. It's also between her and her life, and her and her spirit. That's what she's got leftover to wrestle with once you've made your decision. You know, I'd quite understand if you wanted to exercise option number three and ask me to leave. I won't be offended. You know, I lost my dad when I was nine. I was raised by my mother and three sisters, and I've spent almost my entire life surrounded by headstrong women. An opinion or two doesn't bother me. Do you have any sugar? So, uh, thanks for helping me with the, uh... I enjoyed it. I like Easter. That's not exactly what I meant. I know. ( whistling ) What? What are you looking at? Oh, uh, nothing. Oh, she speaks. By the way, I've got to go to Watertown today on business. So, uh, I'll be away for the night. For the night? Uh-huh. But I'll be back tomorrow. But we're celebrating our birthdays tomorrow. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. I realize that. But I'll be back in the morning. You got my cell-phone number just in case there's any problems. OK? Hey, girls, show some fortitude. You've been left on your own before. I'm sure you can handle it. See you in the morning. It's been so long since you played. Yeah, I guess it, um, I guess it reminds me of Mom. Why don't we open our presents to one another? Without Daddy? He went on a stupid business trip, didn't he? Yeah. Where is it? Virginia? Yeah? Oh. Found it. You first. OK. Oh, Virginia, it's, um... it's beautiful. What do you think? It matches your eyes. I mean, well... not right now. But, well... Oh, jeez. I love it. - OK, open mine. - OK. Oh, Caroline. It's just like Mom's. I know. I have a confession. Yeah? I've read Mom's diary. I know. So have I. You have? It's under your mattress. Turn to March 5th, 1991. "I took Caroline to the stables today, again," "and tried to get her on Misty. " "She bawled her eyes out. She wanted no part of that horse. " "I was disappointed at first, but it made me" "take a hard look at myself" "and admit that I was doing it more for me than for her. " "I wanted another rider in the family so much," "but I wasn't thinking about her needs. " "Even though they seem sort of undeveloped," "kids have their own outlook on life. " "You can interfere with them up to a point," "then you have to back off. " "I really don't care now" if Caroline ever gets on a horse or not. " "She's going to find out what interests her" "and she's going to become her own person. " "She and Virginia have brought so much joy into my life, " "so much more than I ever thought" "a God-given gift possible. " "And I have to pinch myself each day" "just to make sure it's real. " You memorized it. I was so afraid that it would get lost someday. ( engine rumbling ) Stormy! Hey, boy, how you doing? Just one minute. I'll be right back. Thank you, thank you. Oh, thank you! Happy birthday. Quit bawling. Take him out for a spin. Go! What? Nothing. Nothing. ( whistling ) ( chuckling ) Oh. It's fine. It's so beautiful. I know. I can't believe Dad got me a pearl. I can't believe he bought me Stormy! Hey. Wow. You guys look... you look great. - So do you. - Oh, well, thank you. But the tie has to go. - Why? What's wrong with it? - Everything. Hmm, let's see here. You're ready. Go on. Dad? Are you sure this is a good idea? Look, I've taken you to Blake and Lydia's Easter- bonnet party since before you could crawl. Have you seen my car keys? We can't avoid them forever. Besides, it's been a while since I've taken my girls to a dance. Have you seen my... ( humming ) Give them to me! ( laughing ) Ford! Girls! I'm so glad you came. Hello, Lydia. It'd be a shame not to have you here. I love your bonnets. Thank you. Ford, save a dance for me? Oh, look, there's Jessie. She's with Mr. Crane. Ughhh! Uh. Well, let's go say hello. No, she's, uh, she's dancing. So what? I don't know what to say... Come on! Come on, Dad. Show a little fortitude. Yeah. Come on! - I, I... this is... - Come on, come on. You know what? OK, stay right here. Excuse me. Cutting in. Good afternoon, Mr. Crane. - Miss Lofton. - Yes. - Oop! - Oh! So, did she like her present? Well, it got her attention, that's for sure. Good. Ahem. So, would you like to dance? I think that was the plan. ( slow music playing ) # Where are you tonight # I wonder # And where will you be # Tonight when I cry # Will sleep to you come easy # Though I alone # Can slumber # Will you welcome me # In the morning # At another one's side # How easy for you # The years # Have slipped under # And left me a shadow # The sun can't dispel # I have built for you a tower... Cutting in. # Of love and adoration... Caroline. I, uh... Didn't know you would make it today. I wouldn't have missed it. You look great. How do you feel? ( gasping ) Feeling much better. Thanks. Ohhh! 'Morning, Dad. Hi, Virginia. You have a good ride in the rain? Yeah. You know, he's so strong. Strong enough for an endurance race, would you think? Excuse me? Oh, it's just that there's an endurance race Memorial weekend... I thought... Yeah? Thought you might like to enter, that's all. But of course, if you, uh, if you don't want to... No, no, no! I mean, yes, I mean no! Yes, I want to ride, I want to ride! - Are you sure? - Yes, I want to ride. Thank you, thank you. - Watch the branch, Virginia. - Oh! Slow. ( Virginia ): I rode with Dad for the first time in so long. He borrowed Charlie from Mr. Tucker. Stormy's pulse hit 129, but came right back down after five minutes. He's going to be ready. Personally, yours truly feels like one big knot. Dad got me on what he calls boot-camp schedule. Three more weeks until the race. It's weird seeing Dad and Jessie together. I have a premonition about it, but I think it's a good one. You pick a 10-mile stretch in the race, then you make your move. The idea is to burn out the pack around you, so that you put enough distance between you and them so they can't catch up with you. Dust them off. Got it? Got it. Come on. Virginia, go! Whoa! Look at you, Ms. Hunter Jumper. Easy, boy. Oh, don't worry, Wendy, he doesn't bite. His name's Stormy. He's not afraid of your stupid horse. Oh, no? You sure about that? ( laughing ) What are you dweebs laughing at? Let's see what else he can do. How about a race down to the tracks? ( train whistle blowing ) Um... Ooh, 1:00 train. Makes things interesting. Some other day, Darrow. What's wrong? You need permission from your mommy? Oh, sorry, I mean daddy. Yaaa! Yaaa! Yaaa! Come on. Let's go. ( train whistle blowing ) Go for it, Stormy. ( brakes screeching ) Come on. ( train whistle blowing ) ( horse neighing ) ( Virginia ): It rained really hard last night, but it's supposed to clear up forthe race, which is tomorrow. Stormy's ready. I think I am, too. And somehow, I just know that Mom will be watching. Stormy! He couldn't have gotten out, Dad. Even if I left the door wide open, he would've stayed until I got him! He can't have got far. He's around here somewhere. He was stolen, and you know it. The tire tracks. You know it. Who would steal a horse in a storm? Darrow. Darrow? He may be a spoiled brat, but stealing horses is way out of his league. I whipped his butt in a race. He's afraid of me and Stormy. He doesn't want to lose. Racing? You have no business racing, especially that idiot. Look, I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't have, I mean... I shouldn't have. ( arguing ) ...get the hell off my property. Can you pass me the, uh, meat? Dad. Dad, wait up. Hey, where you going? I'm going to get, get the word out, keep looking, talk to the sheriff. Great. Then you can drop me off in town. Caroline, I think you should stay with your sister. Dad, I've got a hair appointment, And I can't cancel it. A hair appointment? Yeah. She'll be fine. She's tougher than you think. Come on, let's go. Hair appointment. OK. Thanks a lot. Bye, Dad. (p.a.): Attention, please, attention. All contestants are requested to report to the registrations table and then proceed to the scale, where they will be weighed in with their tack. Hi, Joel. Hi. ( telephone ringing ) Hello. Ah, Virginia, I know where Stormy is. What?! Darrow and his two dweebs did steal him. Well, how do you know? I told dweeb number one, Joel, that I've always had a massive crush on him. ( Virginia ): Uh-huh. He's so pathetic. He spilled everything. Oh, my God, the race! It starts at noon. That's 45 minutes. Where's Dad? He dropped me off and split. I think he's still looking. Oh, jeez, where... where is Stormy? Don't do anything stupid. - I won't. ( Caroline ): - Promise me? Caroline! The shack at Lampert Creek. Virgin... In your dreams. ( laughing ) ( engine reving ) I'm sorry. Oh... Come on. Please. Ohhh! ( groaning ) No, whoa, whoa, whoa... Oh, OK, OK... ahhh! Clear. Mount up. 'Morning, Blake. 'Morning, Colonel. Oh. Whoa, whoa! Contestant number 17, Darrow Raines. 168 pounds. Mount up. Oh, whoa, whoa! Oh, oh, oh, stop. OK. Stormy! Stormy! Excuse me, may I have your attention, please? Attention, please. Quiet! The course is marked with the customary white flags indicating turn-offs and paths. There will be two vet checks, where your horse's pulse will be taken, and overall fitness to continue will be assessed. As you can see, the route will take you out of town and continue to the barrens, where vet check one will be. After leaving the first vet check, you will be looping around the countryside, doubling back over the barrens and the route to the finish. You may consult your maps if you are unclear at any time. And I should like to point out that this year we have A magnificent new trophy, Generously donated by Blake Raines. Thank you. Thank you. Dad! I was looking all over for you. Listen, I hate to say this, but I think the horse has been stolen. Darrow stole it. His friend confessed. I called Virginia, looked for you and called Virginia back. Slow down. Did Virginia say where she was going? No, I just told her not to do anything stupid. ( siren wailing ) Virginia! Oh, no. Clear the road, please. Everyone stand back. Clear the road, please. Dad. Caroline told me, and then I drove the spare truck. You what? You said it was for emergencies... - OK, spare me the gory details. - 'Morning, Ford. Saw her out of town, occupying a lane. Thanks, Sam. No problem. Kind of like to see Raines's kid get his butt kicked. I'm tired of him and his old man thinking they run the county. We got another one. Huntington, let's get the show on the road. Right. They weren't briefed, and I do not have their names on the morning sign-up sheet. What are you talking about? They're already registered. They're just a few minutes late, that's all. Sorry, I can't permit it. - Let her ride! - Yeah, let her ride, Quinn. Let Virginia ride. ( all ): Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride... Riders on your marks. Come on, Misty, come on. Go get 'em, Melissa. ( all ): Let Virginia run! Let Virginia run! Let Virginia run! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride... This is bordering on civil disobedience, officer. And it's your duty to stop it. Forthwith. Seems to me there's an easy way to do that... forthwith. Let Virginia ride forthwith. ( all ): Let Virginia ride! Let Virginia ride! Oh, all right, put her on the scales. ( cheering ) Good luck, Virginia. Thanks, Melissa. Whoa, whoa, Misty. Slow down, girl. Hey! - Move it, get out of the way. - Hey, knock it off! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, boy, come on. Yah... yah! - Watch it. - Hey, hey, hey! I had no choice, Blake. There was no recourse. It was a mob run amok. Crane, you're a coward. Right. Ah, what the hell. She's so far behind, anyway. You know the routine. Let's go to work. - Whoa, whoa. - Whoa, Son. Good job. Come on, Crane. Let's go. Move it. - Check her here. Here you go. - Thanks. - Come on, come on. - Check it, check it, come on. Yes, yes. - Come on. - You have plenty of horse left. Ride him into the ground if necessary. 132... rather fast. He'll need at least 10 minutes. - Five minutes! - Five minutes. Perfect. Right. Clear. Come on, Darrow. Go get 'em. OK, got him. Come on. Who's in front? Costello and Raines. - Gary. - Hey, Ford. - Dad... - What's he got? 94. He'll need around eight minutes. Eight minutes! Dad... Virginia, calm down, you've got plenty of time, plenty of time. Relax. Yah! Yah! Ahh... oof! Come on, Misty. Come on, girl. Hmm... - She's in the race. - How far back? Close enough. I should've kept that damn horse. I don't lose races, Son. Huntington! Huntington! Get over here! You're pushing him pretty hard, Darrow. I'll take care of this horse, Miss Eastwood. - I got it. No problem. It's not necessary. I can handle it. I'm quite familiar with this horse. 135. He'll need about 12 minutes. 12 minutes? What the hell are you talking about? He's overheated. His pulse is racing. 12 minutes rest, and we'll check it again. Oh, my God, you idiot. Excuse me? Damn it! Uh, Jessie. I apologize for my... my boy. Uh, he's a real hothead. Probably spoil him too much. But, you know, 12 minutes seems a lot. The horse needs it, Mr. Raines. Miss Eastwood, have you been happy working at the ranch? - Yes. - Good. 'Cause I've been happy with you. When I see someone doing a good job, I make it a point to reward her. So, what exactly are you saying, Mr. Raines? I think you should recheck the horse. No. The specs are correct. And you could let go of my arm now. Come on, boy, come on. Yah. Clear. Clear. Let's go. Come on. Get out of the way! Hey! What the... Let's go. Come on. Hey! Come on! Stupid horse, let's go. Yah! Yah! Good boy. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, boy. Hey! Hey! Ahh! Yah! Stormy! Stormy! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Yah! All right... Ugh! Come on, boy. Hey! You got two minutes. Suck it up. Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa... whoa. Good boy. All right, come on, boy. We can do this. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, boy, easy. Whoa, whoa. What is it, Storm? OK. Come on. Yah! ( whinnying ) Damn it! Yah! Come on, come on. Go easy, that's it. Come on, yah! Yah! Let's go. Come on, Storm. Yah... yah! Here they come! It's Virginia and Darrow! Here they come! It's Virginia and the spoiled brat! All right! Come on, Virginia! ( cheering ) Come on, Darrow! Move, so I can see! Come on, you can do it. Come on. Yah! Let's go. Let's go, Darrow. Come on, Son! Come on, boy! Yah! Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Bring it home, Storm, bring it home. Good boy. - Are you ok? - Yeah. - Did you fall? - I had a little help... Stupid horse! But I'm fine. - You did so good. - Thanks. Right on, Virginia! May I have your attention, please? Your attention. Entry number 36, Miss Virginia Lofton, has been disqualified. What? ( booing ) Settle down. Hear him out. We've just learned of a course violation which has, ahem, has been, uh, verified by a secondary source. Verified by who? His old man? And, and after a judicial review, the official winner is... is Darrow Raines. That's my boy. ( booing ) Ha, ha... Come here, Son. Ha, ha, hey! We did it, buddy. Check his pocket. - OK. - Way to go, buddy. That trophy will look great on the mantle. Run up and get it. Ooh... Whoa-ho! Everyone, I want to thank my family, friends... and, to all the racers, you rode a real clean race. Thank you. Mr. Marshal, would removing a flag from the course qualify as a violation? ( crowd ): Ohh... Busted! Cheater! I repeat that, uh, uh, that after a, uh, after a thorough examination of the, uh... ahem... of, of the facts... Put me down! ( giggling ) ( both ): One... two... three! Ahh! Go get it. It's yours. You deserve it. Go. Here you go. Yeah! Speech, speech, speech... Well, you know, I'd like to thank my sister for finding Stormy, of course. Ahh! Ha, ha, ha... This is good. I made the pie. He doesn't make pie, he buys it. I've been thinking... I've been thinking. Come on, spit it out. I'm thinking we'll paint the front of the house. Yeah, right, like we paint the house and you watch. Oh, that's you... You never do anything when you want. We do what we always do. We all do it together, and... Oh, ho... You are so, totally, grounded. ( laughing ) ( Virginia ): It was the happiest I've seen Dad in such along time. He said Jessie would spend the night in my room, because Blake fired her, kicked her out of the guesthouse. She didn't seem very upset. Caroline is out of her Darrow phase, and her nose looks almost perfect again. ( Jessie ): If you're painting the house, paint the barn. May I please be excused? (Virginia ): I think Mom would be smiling and laughing right now, too. I got through the race because of her and Stormy, and wanted to find a really good way to thank them. I'm going to give Stormy a week off, which I think he'll really like. But I didn't know what I could do for my mom. After a while, though, I sort of figured something out. I realized that I can't do anything for her like I can do for Stormy. I can never bring her back... But I can always keep her in my heart, like my dad said. And, that way, she'll never be far away. She'll know when I goof up. And she'll know when I do something good. And that's OK. Yes! I did it, I did it, I did it...
