How're you? - Fine. How're you? - Who is that guy? Paul Madvig. - He's head of the Voters League. - MAN: Hello, Mr Madvig. Glad to see you. Hello, son. He's the biggest crook in the state. I hear he feeds a thousand people a week. Is it true you've throwing over Governor Hartman? What about Ralph Henry and his Reform Party? If Ralph Henry's so anxious to reform somebody, why don't he start on that son of his? He's gets in more jams than the dead end kids. That's for talking about decent people. A little reform wouldn't do you any harm. As a matter of fact, I think it would do the state good if somebody'd reform you right out of existence. Get out of my way, you cheap crook. Hey, what a slugger. - Who is that? - Ralph Henry's daughter. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Hey, Ed. - Hiya, Paul. I just met the swellest dame. - Yeah? - Yeah. She smacked me in the kisser. - All right. - Hey, Sloss, come here. - I don't get it. - Look... - What do you want? - Oh, never mind. Go out and tell old man Henry I want to see him, will you? - That's a good one. - What is? - Are you serious? - Why not? What'll Nick Varna and the rest of the boys say if they hear you've been talking to a Reform candidate? Oh, what do I care what they say. - You'd better care! - Oh, yeah? Yeah, if you want to keep on being boss. You better wash your mouth out, young fellow. Come here. SLOSS: Lay off there, will you! (WOMEN SCREAMING) Tell Madvig I want to see him right away. Yes, Mr Varna. MAN: Four is your point, Ed. MAN 2: Come on, Ed. Ed, Nick Varna wants to see Paul. Little Joe, brother, that's it. I'll tell him you're here. Yeah, take care of yourself, Gus. Right. Hi, Ed. Nick Varna's downstairs. - Yeah? - He wants to see you right away, Paul. - Tell him I'm busy. - But, Paul... Tell him if he wants to wait around, maybe I can find some time for him later. Maybe. Tell him. - Paul. - Yeah? You're really going through with that crazy idea? What crazy idea? Backing old man Henry on the Reform ticket. - That's right. - That's wrong. - "That's wrong"? - Yeah. As wrong as those socks. Wait a minute, what's wrong with them? - The clock. - Yeah. Mmm-hmm, it ticks too loud. You know I thought they was pretty. Yeah, old man Henry and me is cooking up the deal tonight at dinner. At his house. And say, Ed, it's his daughter's birthday, what do you think I ought to give her? - Want to make a good impression? - Sure. - Nothing. - But why? Because you're not supposed to give people things, unless you're sure they like to get them from you. Well, maybe. But I'm not gonna pass up an opportunity like this. - You see, I like... - All right. Give her a convertible or a handful of diamonds. Well, maybe you know more about it than I do, I guess. Think he'll play ball after election? I know he will. Why, he's practically given me the key to his house. - Yeah, a glass key. - Hmm? - Be careful it doesn't break off in your hand. - Don't worry. It won't. How far has that dog got her hooks into you? Ed. I'm gonna marry Janet Henry. Course nobody knows about it yet, except you and me. Well, you'd better insist on the wedding before election day. Eh? Then you can be sure of your pound of flesh. But, Mr Varna, he left positive orders to... Shut up, Oswald. Come on in. Have a chair. - Cigar? - Thanks. You know, Paul, they closed my places last night. Broke a lot of equipment. Yeah. We read about it in the paper. Rainey said the order came straight from you. Well, what do you think of that, Ed? I think somebody ought to give Rainey a nice long vacation. Business is business and politics is politics. But they ought to be kept apart. I bought protection, Paul, and I want it. Well, I tell you, Nick. We're gonna clean up this town. I'm too big to take the boot from you now. You maybe too big to take it laying down, Nick, but you're gonna take it. - You are taking it. - Oh, no, I'm not. The Golden Club's open tonight. Get me Rainey. Hello, Rainey, it's Paul. How're the folks? Good. Hey, look, Rainey, just got the tip that Nick is opening his Golden Club tonight. Yeah, slam him down so hard, they'll splash! - Well, Nick, now you know where you stand. - Thanks. (LAUGHING) PAUL: I tell you, you haven't got a thing to worry about. We mustn't forget the opposition. What, that guy here reminds me of is an electric fence. Buzzing around all day, nothing comes out but wind. (ALL LAUGHING) You know politics is simple. All you need is a little muscle. Look, muscle gave me my start in politics. It was when I was assistant to old man Zimmerman, the plumber. Mr Madvig, you're joking. You mean about the plumbing or the muscle? Well, I just can't imagine you as a plumber. No? I'll drop up to your bathroom some day and show you. (ALL LAUGHING) MAN: Well, Paul, I must say, you've come a long way since then. Yeah. Coffee will be served in the living room, Mr Madvig. Okay. He's funny, but don't you think he'll get a bit tiresome as a steady boarder? Paul's support means the Governorship for me. I know, but is being Governor worth it? Don't joke. And you must be nice to him, Janet, anyway until after the election. All right, Dad, at least he'll be some laughs. - Janet... - Why weren't you at dinner? With Madvig, I'd sooner cut my throat. Look, I've got to have some money. But I've already given you every penny I have. - Well, then ask Dad for a loan. - I can't. Oh, Taylor, why don't you stop gambling? Don't go sanctimonious on me. I'm not. But if you'd only stop for a while. RALPH: Taylor. - Janet, do you mind, please? - No. Taylor, do you realise that you're attitude toward Madvig is very embarrassing to me? - I'm not running for Governor. - Well, I am. Your gambling, your night-clubbing and your drunkenness has got to stop. - Oh, that's just ducky. - I mean it. On Monday I'm gonna find you a job. If that doesn't straighten you out, I'll... - Where're you going? - Out. Thank you. Hey, there's Ed Beaumont. Come on. Come on in, Ed. Want you to meet Janet Henry. This is Ed Beaumont. How do you do? So you're Mr Madvig's assistant. He's more my partner, I'd say. Anything to eat, Ed? Oh, Mr Henry, do you know Ed Beaumont? Oh, yes, yes, I know who you are. Oh, here are those figures you wanted for Mr Henry. Oh, yeah, thanks, Ed. Won't to stay for coffee, Mr Beaumont? Yeah, sure, come on. Little drop of java will wake you up. Some coffee for Mr Beaumont. - And brandy? - Thank you. You know, Ed, I was just telling Janet, Miss Henry here, about the time I was in the newspaper business. Yes, you were saying you had a job at The Observer, but you didn't say what it was. Oh, well, it was sort of like in the circulation department, you know. You see, I used to go around the different newsstands and I'd ask for a paper, if the guy'd hand me The Observer, that was okay. If he'd hand me The Post, I'd slug him. That was to teach him a lesson, you know? Oh, you were sort of an Observer missionary? No, because a little while later, I made the same deal with The Post. Well, how could you serve both newspapers, Paul? You see, if the guy handed me The Observer, I'd slug him for The Post. If he hands me The Post, I'd slug him for The Observer. It was very simple. You certainly were a two-fisted newspaper man, Mr Madvig. Wasn't he, Mr Beaumont? PAUL: Yeah, but there was just one hitch. I used to have to be very careful about repeating. But once I missed. I remember it was on Third and Broadway, I slugged a guy for handing me The Observer. About a week later, I got balled-up and I found myself in the same spot. Well, the guy hands me The Post so I have to slug him again. You should have seen the expression on that fellow's face. There was enough there for an expression? PAUL: Oh, sure, I just used to slug him easy with the left. But you haven't heard the topper. Quite a while later when I'd gotten out of the racket, I found myself back in the same spot. Well, the guy saw me coming and what do you think he handed me? The Christian Science Monitor. And you slugged him again? No, I didn't have no deal with The Monitor. Oh, what a pity. - I must be going. - RALPH: Oh. - Good night, Mr Henry. - Good night. - Good night, Paul. - See you in the morning, Ed. I'll see you to the door, Mr Beaumont. I'm sorry you're leaving so soon, Mr Beaumont. I'm sure you've have some interesting stories, too. I think you've had enough laughs from the wrong side of the tracks for one evening. You're hardly the type people laugh at. There are people who don't laugh at Paul. Oh, he is amusing for a limited time. To be with him everyday, how can you stand it? I get along very well with Paul because he's on the dead up-and-up. Why don't you try it sometime? OPAL: Ed! Oh, hello, Opal. I've been looking all over for you. I've been slumming with your brother up at the Henry house. Ed, I need your help, I gotta have some money. Yeah. How much? All you've got. Don't ask any questions, Ed. Please, don't even tell Paul. All right, Snip. You're sweet, Ed. Mr Varna, please. Taylor Henry. Hello, Nick. I've got $500 for you. But, Nick, I'll have the rest in a couple of days, I promise. Oh, he's sore. But he'll take the $500. How can I ever thank you, baby? OPAL: Ed! - Let's go, Snip. - Now wait a minute. - Put 'em on. - Who do you think you are, Beaumont? - Hurry up. - I'm not going, you get out of here! - Sure, with you. - Taylor, stop him! (GROANING) Let go of me. Let go! Here's your key, Snip. - I hate you. - You'll outlive it, baby. - No, I won't ever. Good night! - I'm coming in. - To lock me in my room, I suppose. - Not a bad idea. You can't stop me from seeing Taylor. Neither you nor Paul. I've got a right to happiness just like anybody else. - I'm free, white... - And 18. What's wrong with being 18? Lots of girls get married when they're 18. Why, Taylor's own mother even. Hey, what are you two barking about this time? What's the matter, didn't they feed you at the party? Did I hear something about Taylor Henry? Have you been seeing him again? No, I just happened to mention his name. You don't have to lie for me. Yes, I saw him tonight! After all I've said? - Where were they? - In a nightclub. We weren't. I was at his apartment. - You were... - And I don't see what business it is of yours! You're supposed to be my brother not a watchdog. No sister of mine is gonna be taken in by any cheap, chiselling, tinhorn, playboy like... OPAL: He's not a playboy. You know it. This the first time you've been to his apartment? No, it isn't, I've been there dozens of times! (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Ed! Ed, Paul's gone up to Mr Henry's house after Taylor. He's gonna kill him. Take it easy, Snip. Paul's not that crazy. I'd be a chump to go up there at this time of night. Now you go to sleep. (DOOR CLOSING) I thought you went home. Did you find Taylor Henry? - Opal phoned you, huh? - Yeah. Did you find him? I found the old man. Had a long talk with him. - Wasn't Taylor there? - No. Why? He's lying outside the house in the gutter. He's dead. Yeah, so? Didn't you understand what I said? - Sure. - Well? Well what? He was killed. What do you want me to do about it? Bust out crying? Should I call the police? Don't they know about it? There was nobody around when I found him. Thought I'd better see you before I did anything. - Is it all right to say I found him? - Why not? Ed, you're a fool. One of us is. Hey, think I'll ask Janet if she'd like a lift home. - I wouldn't. - Why not? - She'll want to ride with her father. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, Nick. - Yeah. - I got an idea. - What? - Why don't we knock off Madvig right here? - What? Sure, then they don't even have to move him to bury him. When I want your advice I'll ask for it. I was sorry to hear about Taylor, Mr Henry. - He was a friend of mine, and a nice boy. - Thank you. - Could I have a word with you, please? - What is it? I suppose you realise that politically it don't look so good for you. - Why not? - Because of Madvig. The Observer is already hinting he killed your son. And it won't be long before half the state will believe it. Get a load of that. How do you like that? Varna butting in that way. He's got a nerve. I think I'll go over and try this out. Hey, keep your shirt on. But with me and The Observer you're a cinch. - Think it over. - No, thank you. Just as you say. Good afternoon, Miss Henry. - Where you going? - I'll meet you at the car. Miss Madvig? May I speak to you for a moment? You loved Taylor, didn't you? I just heard something I think you ought to know. - What about? - About Taylor's murder. ED: Hey, Opal! Ready to go, Snip? Miss Madvig and I were having a private conversation. A funeral's hardly the place to talk about a murder. Even privately. It is if you've just heard Nick Varna say he had enough evidence to convict someone of Taylor's murder. He said that? Who? Your brother. Why don't you peddle your scandal to someone who wants to hear it? Don't pay any attention to that stuff, Opal. It's only Nick Varna's way of... What's all the gab about? Hello, Snip. I know. It's tough. Come on, move over and I'll drive you home. (SOBBING) No! I'm sorry, Mr Beaumont, Mr Farr isn't in. - When'll he be back? - Oh, I don't know, he didn't leave word. Think I'll take a chance and wait in his office. - You can't do that! Mr Farr'll be angry. - Don't you like this job, sonny? Oh, it's you, Ed! (CHUCKLING) That crazy kid. He never gets anything right. A Mr Bowman, he told me. You trying to give me the run-around now that Paul's in trouble? No, Ed, you know it's nothing like that. Here, have a cigar. You know, Ed, there are some people who think we're pretty slow in cleaning this murder up. Yeah? What have you got? Here. Take a look at this. Tell me what you think of it. Now, I don't attach any importance to that, Ed. Nuts are always writing in anonymous letters on every case. Ed, for heaven's sakes, you don't think I'd take that thing seriously, do you? I just wanted to show it to you. - You said anything to Paul? - About the letter? No. Well, don't. - What's Nick Varna got? - He's coming in to see me tomorrow. Well, I've got to listen to him, Ed. There's a lot of pressure on this case, especially from The Observer. And I can't just sit here and... If Paul tells you to, you'll sit, stand or ride a bicycle. I'm District Attorney of this county! And I'll... Well, of course, if you... If Paul... - lf there's any real reason why I shouldn't. - There isn't any reason. And I wouldn't like you to go around thinking there was. And tonight I'd buy that bicycle. (YELLING) Hey, get your paper. Hey, read all about it. "May call Madvig in Henry murder." Hey, read all about it, extra, extra. Hey, get your paper. "May call Madvig in the Henry murder." Hey, get your paper. Hey, read about that Henry murder! - See The Observer, Paul? - Yeah. Well? Look, do we have to go through that, "Well? Well what?" routine again? Not if you don't want to. Oh, Ed, stop getting your tonsils in an uproar. I've had the newspapers after me for years and I'm still sitting pretty. You ever tried sitting pretty in an electric chair? What are you trying to do, scare me? The Observer's already talking about a secret witness. No, fiddle-faddle. If Varna's got something, he's gonna give it to the paper. He's the one that's spreading all that dirt. Patch up your trouble with him, Paul. I'll patch up nothing with that pop-eyed spaghetti-bender. He's gotta learn that when I say things are closed down, they're closed down. What's good enough for the old Eighth Ward is good enough for anywhere, huh? Well, the system has worked pretty good up to now, ain't it? - Sorry I bothered you with my nonsense. - Nonsense is right. And I don't wanna hear any more guff about Nick Varna or Taylor Henry neither. Okay, I'll see you don't have to. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Hello. What is this, a social service call? You don't like me, do you, Mr Beaumont? I think I do. I'm pleased. Even with such qualified approval. Why are you pleased? For some obscure reason, I think you're very nice. Say the not so obscure reason. I'd hoped you'd help me find Taylor's murderer. Do I look like a guy that runs down murderers? You look as though you could. I'm sure you can tell me one thing I want to know. What? - Did Paul kill him? - No. You're sure? You know you're Paul's best friend, and you found Taylor's body. All right, let's have it. - What? - The letter. Come on, give. I got one just like this. Some half-witted crackpot. But if it's not a crackpot, I've got to be sure. Won't you help me? No. I see. You're afraid. You think Paul'd misunderstand because you're his friend. Don't get any such corny ideas. If I want to help you, or I wanted to, it wouldn't make any difference whose friend I was. - But you said you liked me. - Sure. You're built well, got a pretty face, nice manners. But I wouldn't trust you outside of this room. You're slumming, and I don't go for slummers. You think you're too good for me. Well, sister, it so happens I think I'm too good for you. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - Who is it? - Paul. - Paul! - In there. Come in. Hi, Ed. Doing a little packing, huh? Yeah. - Where you going? New York? - For a starter. When you coming back? One-way ticket. - Hey, now, look, Ed, if I said anything... - Got to stop by the jeweller's. - Wanna come along? - Yeah, sure. Travelling alone, huh? Let's get going. New York. Kind of cold now. - Sure you wanna go, huh? - Tired of hick town stuff. Meaning me, I suppose. You know, Ed, you're awful hard to get along with. Never said I wasn't. How about a drink? Sort of a farewell toast. Okay. - Hello, Paul. - Hi, Paul. - Hi, Ed. - Hello, Paul. Hi, guys. Couple of beers. Well, Ed, I guess you don't think much of me as a big time politician, do you? - Figure it out for yourself. - I've done all right. I don't think I'm any Napoleon, but I've come a long way since the old Eighth. You think you have. What do you want me to do, write Nick a love letter and tell him all is forgiven? Well, it wouldn't be a bad idea. Look, Ed, all I know is, when you start a fight, you finish it. What are you sticking up for him for, anyway? I'm not sticking up for Nick. I'm just tired of everybody outsmarting you, that's all. Who's outsmarting me? All right, rubber-ears, come on. Okay, spill it. Who's outsmarting me? Do you have to ask that? You're backing Reform till you get yourself jockeying into picking a fight with Nick. And if that isn't enough, you play ball with a guy who'll dump you overboard as soon as he's elected. - All for a snooty dame that wouldn't look at... - Cut it out! - Well, I gotta be going. - Oh, wait a minute, Ed. - Take your hand off of me. - Oh, now, cool off, will you? Come on. - Let go. - Sit down, Ed. Get out. Get out! - Beaumont's here. - Good, send him in. Come on in. Thanks for trying to talk some sense into Paul. - I thought he was wrong. - He'll know he was before I get through. Now let's get one thing straight. Is this split between you and Paul for good? - You sent for me, didn't you? - Yeah. - I came, didn't I? - Okay. - Got any plans? - Ticket to New York. You can do yourself some good right here. How? You ought to know plenty about Paul Madvig. What's your proposition? Thanks. Why did Paul bump off young Taylor? - Nice pooch. How old is he? - Seven. You haven't answered my question. You haven't made your proposition. I'll stake you to the finest gambling place in town. Let you run it to suit yourself with plenty of protection. Why would you be getting any protection? You're not so hot for putting in with me, are you? Wasn't my idea. Sit down. I tell you what. I'll give you 10 grand in cash right now, 10 more election night if we beat Paul and the gambling house offer still goes. What do I have to do? Matthews, the publisher of The Observer, is outside. I want you to give him the lowdown on Paul, and all the dirt on how he's running the city. Most of it's just routine. Nothing to it. All right. But there's something in that Taylor Henry killing. We could start with that. - Maybe. - You mean, we ought to start with 10 grand? Thanks. Now, I haven't got much time. I'll call Matthews in. Just give him the dope. He'll put it in shape. Start off with the money you gave Opal that night. - So you know about that? - Sure, that dough was for me. I still have some of Taylor's IOUs. - Say, you didn't bump him off, did you? - Don't be funny. Listen. You followed Opal to Taylor's apartment. That's an important point. Give Matthews all the details on that. Looks pretty good. You don't think The Observer's printing a lot of wind, do you? You know, I thought you were bluffing, especially by going to Farr. Not much. - You know Sloss? - Yeah, I know him. Paul tossed him out of the leagues downtown at headquarters last week. That's where he made a mistake. Sloss came to me spouting. He saw Paul and Taylor arguing on the street that night. He only lives a couple of blocks away. That's good. But you know Sloss, he'll never stand up. He won't have to. I got his affidavit. That's the McCoy all right. - Where is he now? - New York. But he'll be back tomorrow. First, I'm gonna have him talk to Matthews. Then we'll go and see Farr. There won't be anybody going to see Farr. And you can stick this in your ear. Haddock! (GROWLING) Jeff! Rusty! Let go, Haddock. If you want it this way, you can have it. - Thanks. - Jeff! - What do you got? - Two pair. That makes four bucks I owe you. (MOANING) - Must be having bad dreams. - Yeah, wonder what he's dreaming. - Well, how you making out, brother? - Deal 'em. - Sweetheart, you know what I told you. - Take it easy, Jeff. Give me two cards. Look, sweetie pie, you ought to lie down. You don't feel so good. Jeff, be careful. You're liable to croak him. You can't croak him. He's tough. He likes this. Don't you, baby? (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - Hiya, Nick. - Nick. Hiya, Matthews. The guy's a pip. Every time he comes to, he gets up and starts something. Well, isn't all this beating likely to be fatal? Not unless we want it to be. - The water still in the tub? - It's getting a little dirty. He won't know it. He's okay, Nick. Can you hear me, Ed? This is Nick. Listen. You're going to give Matthews the dope on Paul. All right, I'll have you worked on until you do. - Jeff. - It's a pleasure. - Nick, please! - Shut up. Okay. (THUDDING) It's no good. He's throwed another joe. All right. We'll be back in the morning. Come on. You owe me four bucks. Okay, ain't it? - No potatoes? - No. Where did you learn how to cook? My first wife was a second cook in a third rate joint on Fourth Street. Oh, yeah? What's the matter? Don't you like your steak medium? When I bite a steak, I like it to bite back at me. Rusty! RUSTY: Bust it open! There goes the baby. Get him! Crazy fool! Step on the thing like this. RUSTY: Turn it over! (BOTH SHOUTING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) Please, we're trying to help you. You're badly cut. Get Paul Madvig. Oh, you'll be comfortable by the time Mr Madvig gets here. Get Madvig. Hey, what's this all about? Who wants to see me? - You can't come in here. - Look out. Oh. It's you, huh? Paul, it's Sloss. New York trade for Varna. Big witness. Passed out? Look, if that guy dies, I'm gonna turn this place into a warehouse. Come in, please. ED: Hello, Snip. Oh, you're... You're better. - Yeah. - I'm glad. Ed, what was wrong between you and Nick Varna? We just had a little misunderstanding. Have anything to do with Taylor's murder? No, it didn't. Do you know who killed Taylor? - Did Paul kill him? - Shut up! Ed, did he? If you must be a nitwit, don't go around with a megaphone. Then he did kill him. It would be nice if somebody else in this town besides me thought he didn't. It would be especially nice if that somebody were his sister. Today's Observer practically said he killed him. It wouldn't dare print that if it weren't true. Listen, Snip, you know a lot about newspapers. Matthews is in with Varna. They don't want Paul to win the election. What you saw this morning is only the start of what's coming. They're gonna rattle Taylor Henry's bones until the final vote's cast. You shouldn't mind. Paul doesn't. After all, he's a politician. Matthews wouldn't print it if it weren't true. He wouldn't! Snip, he would! I don't believe you and I never will! (DOOR SLAMMING) Are you awake? There's a lady here to see you. - What kind of a lady? - Miss Janet Henry. - Tell her to go away. - I can't do that. She knows you're better. When are we gonna be alone again? Never, if I can help it. I suppose I'll have to see her. No wonder people beat you up. Come in, please. Paul says you're feeling much better, Mr Beaumont. They say I'll be able to sit up by the first of the year. Paul said you'll be out in a week. Sounds like you've been seeing a lot of Paul. Let's don't talk about Paul. - What do we talk about? - You. - Comfortable here? - More or less. - No fun? - No fun. Hasn't your nurse been treating you well? - Not as well as I'd like. - Poor boy. If I'd known you were being neglected, I would have come sooner. (DOOR OPENING) What's this I heard about coming sooner? I said if I had known he was recovering so rapidly, I would have come sooner. Way I figured, Ed's lucky for you came at all. Oh. Hey, Ed, Janet made me buy these for you. Huh? Oh. - Well, how are you? - Fine. How do you like that? See what comes from having brains? "Use your brains instead of your fists," he's always telling me. Look what happened. I go about my business, he winds up in a hospital. - Yeah, but think of the rest I'm getting. - Yeah. Hey, look. How do you like that? 15 G's. - Congratulations. - Thanks. We're not announcing it until after the election. Oh, no? - How's everything else going, Paul? - Oh, fine. - Keeping Sloss under cover? - Sure. - I'd get him out of town. - Hmm? Paul, don't you have to pick up Opal? Opal? Oh, no. Opal went to the country for the weekend. Where in the country? I don't know. You know, she acted kind of mysterious about it. I guess maybe it's just a party or something, you know. JANET: You better run along anyway. You have to change for dinner. Yeah, yeah. Are you coming? - I'll be along in a minute. - Okay. - That is if you don't mind my staying. - Why should I? Well, Ed, do you need anything? No. Not a thing. I'll take these. Guess you don't at that. Well, I'll see you later. Keep punching them. Do you hate me for this? Why should I? You're not dishing it out to me. You're a strange man. Tell me, why did you take such a beating from Nick Varna? For Paul, on account he pays me. That's no reason. Suppose I said he pulled me out of a river once? - I wouldn't believe you. - Okay. I did it because he's my friend and he's square. Remember? And because he would have taken the same beating for me. That's what I felt about you. A stubborn loyalty. That's why I want you to help me. - Will you? - No. I don't want you around because I'm liable to start making passes at you. Besides, that crummy brother of yours needed killing. What did you do to her? She was as near crying as anybody could be without crying. I must be losing my grip. I used to put young ladies into hysterics. Hey, find out if a guy named Matthews, who owns The Observer, has a place in the country, will you? All right. Thank you very much. - Where are you? - Here. - Matthews has a place near Pine Lake. - Thanks. You've got your clothes on. Well, I can't very well go out without them. People might talk. But it's raining out. You've got a temperature. Dr Redmond will never allow... Send that to Dr Redmond. Isn't it kinda wet for you to be out, Ed? Hey, Rusty, little Rubber Ball is back. I told you he liked the way we bounced him around. I was wondering where you boys were. What do you suppose gives me such a boot out of slugging you? Jeff, you talk too much. Sit down. Won't you take your coat off and dry yourself, Mr Beaumont? Thanks. - You're Mrs Matthews, I take it. - Yes, I am. Sit here, Beaumont, where it's nice and warm. NICK: You feeling all right again, Ed? - ED: I'm fine, Nick. - That's good. You boys can go back to town tomorrow. You see, we were playing safe as long as we didn't know for sure you weren't gonna die. I'm glad you've come, Mr Beaumont. It's been so dull around here. - Nobody talking to you and Opal weeping. - Now, Eloise... Well, you know she's done nothing but weep since she talked with you. It's been awful. Want me to tell you what they're eating their hearts out about? Sure. Opal thinks her brother murdered Taylor Henry. (GASPING) That's what she's been talking to your husband about. - She's been telling him... - Ed, don't! Baby, you're sure one for getting beat up, ain't you? Let him talk. It's kind of entertaining. Well, Opal, am I right? Isn't that what you were doing? - Please. - Oh. Nobody is supposed to talk about it except you and your brother's other enemies. He did murder Taylor! You see? And of course, your husband is going to print her accusation. Not that he believes Paul did the killing, but he's in kind of a tough spot. Nick owns the mortgage on The Observer and he has to do what Nick says. - Stop it, Beaumont! - Shut up. And so, although your husband doesn't believe Paul is guilty, he's going to print the story tomorrow, and it'll carry a lovely wallop. You can just picture it in black ink all over The Observer. Opal Madvig accuses brother of murder. Clyde, is that true? (STAMMERING) Well, I... Here's the funniest angle of it all. Soon as Nick frames Paul Madvig, he'll let The Observer go bankrupt. You see, he doesn't want to be a publisher. Does that mean you're broke? I'm afraid it does, darling. I... Five years. From riches to rags. It's been quite a ride, hasn't it? Will you have a drink with me, Mr Beaumont? Sure. All through, Ed? You'd hardly believe how through I am. Well, what does it amount to? It's our turn to hang one on you and Paul and we're doing it. The girl came here on her own. So did Matthews. So did you. Now, as far as I'm concerned, she and you and he can go wherever you wanna go. I'm going to bed. Come on, boys. Wait a minute. You mean, I don't get to smack baby? What for? He's through as soon as The Observer comes out in the morning. Good night, Snip. Aren't you coming to bed, dear? Here's how. Little Rubber Ball does all right, don't he? - Should we have another? - Why not? Eloise, please come upstairs. Oh, throw something at him, Mr Beaumont. Why should I go to bed? It's much nicer here. (GUN FIRING) - Which room? - What? - His room. Which is it? - In front. - Ed... - Get your clothes on and get out of here. Was it... Was it Clyde? Yeah. Dead as a mackerel. - Where you going, Ed? - Thought I'd get a little fresh air. It's not a bad idea. Wait a minute. I was thinking it's kinda funny that with an open ink well and a pen on the table, we didn't find any writing up there. What, no writing? We'll have to discuss that sometime. Rusty. This is my pigeon. Hiya, Big Brain. See what I mean? Hey, the party ain't over. We're going out of here, Paul. If you want to stop us, try. - Thanks. - Let him go. Beat it. Hey, take your Sleeping Beauty with you. Well, Ed, you ain't the only one who gets action on our team, huh? Matthews just committed suicide. - Matthews? Here? - Yeah. Listen, The Observer is loaded with dynamite for the morning. Get Judge Thomas on the phone, have him appoint somebody close to us to administer the estate. He can do it because there's no will. And have the administrator kill the story. Get it? - Yeah. - Come on, fellow. Don't wait. But, Paul, I can't make my boys vote the Reform ticket? Why not? Most of them come from a reform school. - Paul. - Hey, I'm good. How are you? MAN: Hey, we'll give a stop to Murphy and Kelly. Hey, look, you're not supposed to be running around like this. I thought you were supposed to stay in bed. I just got a tip from Farr's office. He's gonna bring you in for questioning. Take it easy, will you? What can that over stuffed pelican question me about now we got The Observer shut up? What about Sloss? - Tutt. - Yes, Paul? Donovan and Burns are out picking him up now. They ought to be in any minute. - You got Sloss' ticket? - Yes, Paul. Good. I'm sending him up to Maine for a nice, long rest. I wouldn't be too sure about Farr. We need to buy some more of those anonymous letters. He doesn't think much of the ticket's chances. Well, he don't, huh? Maybe I better go down and give that beetle-nose a little pep talk. Hey, wait a minute. Look, you feel strong enough to come along? - Sure. - Let's go. - Oh, Tutt. - Yes, boss. When Sloss gets here, put him in my office and see that nobody gets to him. Yes, Paul. Hiya, Sloss. Take him up to Tuttle. (GUN FIRING) - MAN: Why, it's Sloss. - That came from your window, Paul. MAN 2: Let me get to him. MAN: What the hell? Paul! MAN 2: What's the matter? No use, Paul. He could have gotten out six different ways. (SIRENS WAILING) Uh-huh. Yes, you're right. I suppose they'll pin this one on me, too. Why not? Sloss was a big witness. No one had a better reason to get rid of him than you. Paul, you got to go to Farr and tell him all you know about the Taylor Henry murder. Think up something else. - Are you covering up for someone? - No. Well, then you better talk. - I can't talk. - Why not? I killed Taylor Henry. Would you tell me how it happened? It was an accident. He was at the house when I was talking with old man Henry about Opal and him. He followed me down the street and started the argument all over again. He took a poke at me. I smacked him and he fell and crushed his skull on the kerb. Certainly gummed things up keeping quiet all this time. Why did you? You had a perfect self-defence plea. I didn't want that. I want Janet Henry. Ed, I want her more than I've ever wanted anything in my life. What chance would I have with her if she knew that... More chance then than you have now. More chance of beating the rap, too. Farr'll never touch me. Listen, if he thought it would do him any good he'd arrest his own mother and get a conviction. And those letters have got him plenty worried. (KEY TURNING IN LOCK) I thought so. So you put up with Paul, be polite to him, for the sake of the political backing your father needed. That was easy. Then she decided Paul killed her brother, was going to escape punishment, but even then she played along. That's splendid. Paul's sister and his sweetheart, both trying to steer him into the electric chair. He certainly has a lot of luck with his women, doesn't he? I wrote those letters. I'm sure Paul killed Taylor and I'm going to prove it. What do you think Paul's going to do when I tell him about all this? You're not going to tell him. What good would it do? Beside you're too fond of him to hurt him. And there's another reason. I'm asking you not to. Can't you forget about Paul for a minute? I thought we'd settled all that. I told you once, Paul wouldn't make any difference if I wanted you. But I don't. You still think you're five points better than Paul and four better than me. - You're wrong. - No, I'm not. Now that we understand each other, let's get out of here. Extra! Read all about it. Extra! Paper! Hi, Al. Hi, Jim. Hi, Ed. Well, looks like you were right about that swivel-neck Farr. Really been putting it to you, haven't they? (CHUCKLES) - Did he get that indictment? - Yeah, don't you worry. We're getting a writ of habeas corpus, there ain't a judge in this town that'll hold me. Any judge'll hold you if you don't come through with the truth. Oh, you too, huh? - Did you have Sloss bumped off? - No. - What about Taylor? - I told you about that. Yeah, you told me. You told me you were keeping quiet for Janet Henry. Well, that's crazy. - She doesn't even like you. - Don't start that again. I'm telling you, she's been trying to shove you into the electric chair by writing anonymous letters to Farr and everybody else. That's enough. What is this, Ed? You trying to get her for yourself? - I'm tired, go on, get out of here. - I'll get out when I finish talking. You'll get out when you're told to. - This is the kiss-off. - Okay, Paul. - Say, Ed? - Yeah? I took your advice. I got that bicycle. My kid's riding it. (SINGING I DON'T WAN TO WALK WITHOUT YOU) - Give me a fresh beer, Joe. - Coming right up. Give me another one. Well, if it ain't "Sock me again" Beaumont. Hello, Jeff. Hey, gang. Meet the swellest guy I ever skinned a knuckle on. - We're gonna have a little drink. - Okay. Nah, not with these mugs. I got just the place for me and you. A little room upstairs that's too small for you to fall down in. I can bounce you around off the walls. That way, we won't be wasting a lot of time while you get up off the floor. Excuse us, gents. We got to go up and play handball. Me and Cuddles. Sit down. Go on, sit in any chair you wanna sit in. If you don't like that one, take another one. I want you to consider yourself my guest. We'll have a couple of drinks. And then I'm gonna knock your teeth out. - Nothing wrong with this chair. - You're a liar. There ain't a chair in this dump worth a dime. Look. See, Beaumont. You don't know a cockeyed thing about chairs. - My error. - Ah, a wise guy. You think I'm drunk. - No, you're not drunk. - I am drunk. I'm drunker than you are. I'm drunker than anybody in this dump. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) What'll it be, gents? Where you been? I rung for you an hour ago. I bring the best friend I got in the world up here for a drink and we got to sit around waiting a half an hour for a broken down waiter. What do you want? - Rye. - Scotch. And don't get the idea I don't know what you're up to, either. I'm not up to anything. I'd like to see Nick, and so I thought I'd find him here. That's a lie. You don't care where Nick is. It's me you're after. - Oh. - I know what you're up to. You're a heel, that's what you are. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna beat the hide off of you. Here's looking at you. I don't wanna look at you. You're a heel. All right, have it your way. You think it's a smart trick coming up here and trying to get me to talk. About what? Sloss? You know what I think about that guy. You ought to get a medal. How'd it happen? Oh, no, wise guy. Little Jeff ain't talking about that. - Why not? A secret? - Yeah. A secret. Between me and Nick and the lamp post. And you ain't no lamp post. - You're a heel. - Buy you a drink. Ain't a bad idea. But you are still a heel. And I'm still gonna knock your block off. Don't worry about me. Nick's got everything fixed. ED: Rye. JEFF: Scotch. I wouldn't bank too much on Nick. Remember he let McMurry fry. Well, I'm not McMurry. A swell chance with all I've got on Nick. What have you got on him? (CHUCKLING) He thinks I'm drunk enough to tell him. Go on, tell him, Jeff. Hi, Nick. Meet Mr Beaumont. - He's a heel. - I told you to stay undercover. This whole joint's undercover, ain't it? - Hello, Beaumont. - Hiya, Nick. - Get much out of him? - No, not much. I think you're a pair of heels. - They've had enough. - Scotch! You talk too much with your mouth, Jeff. I told you that before. - What's the matter with you? - I'm talking to you, Jeff. Well, quit talking to me. You know, we're coming to a place where I am gonna quit talking to you. Don't be a heel, Nick. - You're just burned because I killed Sloss. - Sit down and shut up. Don't paw me. (GRUNTING) (NICK GASPING) - Got the roscoe? - Yeah. Now you see what we got to do? We got to give him the works. (NICK GROANING) Take it easy, Jeff. I'm just a big, good-natured slob. Anybody can push me around all they want to, and I never do anything about it. Let's blow. Give me the roscoe. - What kind of a heel are you? - Sit down. Sit down. Remember I owe you something? Put your hands on the table. What a half smart guy you turned out to be. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Get the cops. Better get a doctor, too, in case Varna's not dead. Better get an undertaker in case he is. (JEFF CHUCKLING) - All right, boys. Put him on ice. - Hold it a minute. So long, sweetheart. - Funny man, huh? - Yeah. You're gonna die laughing. - Take it easy. - All right, boys. The show's all over, clear out. That was pretty slick, Ed. Pinning that Sloss killing on Jeff. Thanks for giving me those bobs. They tell me your wife's folks live in Omaha. Yeah, they got a nice quiet little place up there. I like it. Better wire them that you and the missus are on the way. - What is this? A rip? - Uh-uh. - Just a piece of pretty good advice. - Well, I don't get it. Why don't you get smart? Tomorrow Paul's gonna beat that indictment you hung on him and the first guy he reaches for is gonna be you. In a pig's ear he'll beat it. Okay. But when he nails your ears over the courthouse door, don't say I didn't warn you. Hey, Ed. Ed, wait a minute. Ed, wait, wait. Now, look. I'm not arguing. See? All I'm asking, is how is Paul going to beat the rap? Will you listen to me or do I have to write it down? In the first place there isn't a judge on the bench who'd dare hold Paul now that the Sloss thing is cleared up. Well, but... And in the second place, and hold on to this one, it wasn't Paul that killed young Henry. Hey, how did you figure that out? By that talk I had with him in the hoosegow. We got down to cases and he told me he did it. But... But that don't add up. Look, rummy, it adds up swell. If Paul had done it, he wouldn't have waited till now to tell me. He's covering up for someone. Taking the rap. Taking it for someone extra special. If you'll do like I'll tell you, we'll make the pinch and you can postpone that trip to Omaha. Say, Ed, are you sure you know what you are talking about? I knew what I was talking about when I brought in Jeff, didn't I? Yeah. Yeah. Well, what do you... - What do you want me to do? - Swear out a warrant for murder. - Who's the party? - Janet Henry. Janet Henry. Janet Henry? Why, that's the old man's daughter. That's young Taylor's sister. Why, that's the girl... That's the girl that Paul's been covering up for. - Oh, well, I couldn't do... - Listen to me. I got on her like a car load of bricks. It started when she jumped her brother about Opal and ended up with young Henry where they found him. All along Paul's known she did it and he's been covering up for her. And all along she's hated Paul's guts and hated him for himself and for the stranglehold he had on the family. She's the one that's been circulating those poison-pen letters. Running off at the mouth to Matthews. Trying to shove Paul into the electric chair. I tell you, it's got to be her. So get busy. Say, you're not talking about just ordinary people, Ed. This is Janet Henry. I want no part of it. Better have, Farr. There's only one guy that ever kicked Paul in the pants and got away with it. McCluskey, remember? And he jumped 18 floors into Centre Street before Paul got at him. (DOORBELL BUZZING INCESSANTLY) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - What is it? - I want to see Miss Henry. - At this time of night? - Yeah, this time of night. - I couldn't possible disturb her. - Then I'll do it. That's out of the question, you can't possibly... I can't... You can't come in here. What is it, Peter, what's the matter? Beaumont. - I wanna see your daughter. - I'm afraid you are overstepping yourself. Get her down here or I'll go up and drag her out of bed. I'd better call the police, Mr Henry. - You don't have to. They're already here. - What? - You gonna get her or will I have to? - Ed. - What is it? - Okay, Farr, there's your party. Oh, I don't know, Ed, now. I've... Mr Farr, I must ask you to explain this intrusion. You see, Mr Henry, it was like this... Ed, what does this mean? It means Farr has a warrant for your arrest. Arrest? What for? - The murder of your brother. - Why, man, you're crazy. - You'll have to prove it. - That's absurd. On whose evidence was this preposterous warrant issued. - My evidence, and brother, it's hot. - Ed? Okay, Farr, take her along. All right, go on up and stand by while she gets her clothes. Wait. I think, Mr Farr, you'd better prepare another warrant. I'm the one you want. I killed my son. I... I followed Taylor and Paul after they quarrelled here at the house. I caught up with him in the street. I told Taylor that he was ruining my political career. He struck me. He was going to strike again. Well, we... We scuffled. Somehow, he... He fell, and his head hit the kerb. When Paul and I lifted him up, he was dead. - It was an accident. - And Paul? I made him promise not to say anything. I was getting worried. Afraid we'd have to hang the girl to make the old man crack. MAN: Excuse me, please. (CLAMOURING) I'm glad to see you beat it, Paul. MAN 2: Yeah, the whole thing was a frame, eh, Paul? PAUL: It's good to get out of that cage, I can tell you. Well, I'll see you later. Who you gonna run for Governor in place of Henry? I haven't picked him yet. But whoever it is, you can bet on him for a winner. MAN: That's right. (ALL LAUGHING) - Take those first. - Yes, sir. Ed, I had to come. I want you to take me with you. Ed, there's no use pretending. You love me and you know it. No matter what you'd say to the contrary, there'd always be something inside of me that would say you were lying. But Paul? - No, I... - You owe him plenty. Paul's been fine. And in my heart, I'll always be grateful to him. But if I'm married in gratitude, it would be all I'd have for him. The answer's still no. Still leaves us on different sides of the tracks. Let's dynamite those tracks. Take me with you. You two got it bad, huh? Well, what are you waiting for, you goon. Are you kidding? What do you want me to do? Run out and bring you a preacher? Come on, get going before I change my mind. Hey. I suppose you think I'm nuts? No, the other one. But if you figure on getting married with my rock, you're nuts.
