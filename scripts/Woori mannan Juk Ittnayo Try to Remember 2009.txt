Even if time erodes everything, someone remains unforgettable. Even though the one is unrequited love. The memories of my childhood fill me with warmth. You do slapstick show in sleeping. Are you OK, my dear? Bad daddy, you rode it without me! Go! Go! Go! Go! In-woo! Daddy! You won the race? In-woo! In-woo! What's wrong? Wake up, In-woo! Since then, he didn't allow me to stride more than three footsteps. In-woo! Slow down. In-woo! Well, what "stride" means, daddy? I rarely lost consciousness under daddy's excessive care But, I happened to pass out once in a while. Whenever I passed out, I had weird dreams. Sometimes they were eccentric, or exciting... I was so happy even in dream. And, it ended up with silly dream at times. But, after I waked up, I always had this lingering sadness of which I can't explain. No! She just fell down in front of me. - Oh my god! - The victim is unconscious. Please come quickly. - Well, it's a kind of strategic retreat. - Look! Wait! Anyway TRY TO REMEMBER Do you like this picture? Yes. My son, you seem too busy. So, I text my will to you instead. - Hey, Soo-Yeon. - Where are you? Sorry, Soo-Yeon. I forgot it. - I had urgent business. - Urgent business? Can I make it up tomorrow? Do you have any issue to talk about, don't you? Yes, I do have. Mom, stop this practical joke! Is it funny? Yes. I am very serious. If you truly love and long for someone, you would be born to the one next time. That's why you text-messaged your death will to me and why you wore the mask of dad's face? Yes, I was always wondering how your dad felt like. Did you eat? Of course. Meal time was while ago. What time was it? What? What time is it, now? Can I pay the bill, next week? I will get paid next week. Pardon me? You know, our company was merged into the foreign company. I am sorry to say this, but they are restructuring the company. And, we have to lay off one of each department. So, I am the one? Yes. I told you many times I warned you last time, remember that? But, what are these picures all about? Who care about this kind of pictures? You're doing this to get me troubled. Son of bitch. Well... No need to rush. Did you already get a betterjob? Then, you betrayed me for the better one? What's this? Is this a dog or a bird or what? Son... of bitch...? You come early. Hi. No? But, you always take sugar in your coffee. Actually, I had a blind date a few days ago. I might want to say it nothing. But, it was something for me. I am serious. And, I feel like I'll marry him. Marry him? Yes. Are you kidding me? You don't believe in fate, do you? But, I am a completely fatalist. And, this is my fate. I'm sorry. Hello. I saw your post on internet auction. Hello. Hello? I am sorry. I am late. Here you are. This is for you. It's a bit far away from Seoul but, they'll call you teacher. Also, you have to lease your house to get money for your mother's hospital bills. This is the application form for the job. Call this number, tomorrow. I told them all about you, already. Anyway, why so dry these days? It won't rain at all or what? And, I feel tired... Damn it. You can see my past life? I'm not sure if it's past life. I've seen some visions of others ever since I was a little kid. What did you see? Sometimes, I saw it in my dream orjust came to me like bam! OK, then? Why are you interrupting us? Sometimes, I have strange dream too. What dream? It's always the same. This lady with long hair untied Enough! It's my turn to tell my story. Hello? Did you see it? My charm worked on her. By the way, I am not older than you. We are the same age, OK? We look like the same age, don't we? No, I won't be able to commute from Seoul. Really? That would be great. Then, I'll pack my bags and be there soon. Thank you. See you soon. You're a professor, then? Not really. No? Well, almost the same. They provide me with lodgings. Good! They're really serious to have me at their university. Good. What about you and Soo-Yeon? Good. Actually, she wanted to come and see you. Ah... But, she was put on duty. Instead, she sent you her regards. You must come across your destined love again someday. What did you say? You must come across your destined love again someday. It's what your dad told me though... Somewhat it's been true in that I met your dad. Hello! Who are you? Is it, Gwangduk-li 20, right? You are from Seoul? Yes. I'm General Park. Come here. What are you doing? Come on! Is it OK with you? It's great. Breakfast is served at 7:30 and dinner at 7. Meals are not served after 10 minutes from each meal time. No meal after 10 minutes, understood? Yes, Sir. How long will you stay here? I'll stay here until the end of this semester. Then... Unpack first and take a rest. Thank you. Have we... Have we met before? Pardon sir? Take a rest. You're lucky to eat. I was about to clean the table. Be my guest. Thank you. My dear, say hello to our guest. He's from Seoul. I'm PARK In-woo. Have we met before? This is my dear daughter. Yeah? Ah, Yes. Is there any problem? No problem at all. I'm HwANG Eun-Gyo. It's nice to meet you. Yeah. You have very girlish name. What? You're right. It really sounds girlish. Your wife is a great cook. I've never had tasty food like this. It's me who prepare foods. Why she looked so familiar? I get going. We get going! Hurry up! We have to catch up the bus arriving every 15 mins. My dear. Please slow down. Don't run. You work at the continuing education center? Yes, curriculum management is one of my jobs. So, you are the one who arranged things here for me by phone? Yes, it's me. But... Attention! Hey, you! Bow to the teacher. Good morning. I'm HwANG Eun-Gyo. It's nice to meet you. I'll teach you to take heartfelt photos. No smoking, here. I'm sorry. Luckily, not yet lighted up. Wow, it's exactly what I take in my coffee. Then, you take two spoons of sugar and cream? Don't you think it's great place to be? What? Yes, it's great. I don't know why I haven't noticed this beautiful place before. I wanted to run away from this town all the time. The best way to leave rural town was to go to a university in Seoul. Well, you can't understand it cuz you grew up in Seoul. Have we met before? You asked me yesterday, too. Cuz you look so familiar. Have we met before? Have we, right? Do you know me? Nope. Then, we don't know each other. Yes, you're right. By the way, how did you know I grew up in Seoul? It was on your resume. Wow! Nice weather. Teacher? Get on. It's our fortune to meet each other like this. Let's celebrate it! What about drinking together? You're joining us, right? Yes. Get in! Come on! - In-woo, come and sit here. - Where? Why? You sit here and teacher, come here please. It's OK. Please sit down. Let me test what you taught in the class. Uh? Let me in! One, two, three! Drink a shot. Yes. - Please give me one shot, too. - Sure. Are you going to drink and drive again? Not me, you drive. Excuse me! A coke for him, please. Teacher is so pretty because he's from Seoul. Pretty is not for a man, gosh. What's wrong with you? He's really pretty. What's your problem? Please shut out. You mean cut it out? It's more appropriate. What a narrow mind you are! He just wanted to make a joke. By the way, do you have a girl friend? Yes, I do. Then, are you married? No, not yet. She's just girl friend. In-woo, are you OK? Are you all right? Yes, I am OK. Really? What a stubborn girl. I can drop you off at your house. It's not easy for you to make U-turn. We'd better walk home from here. What about Karaoke? Enough for tonight. Go home or your wife'll kill you. I want to hang out more to sing. You better go home. OK, I got you. Teacher! Yes, sir? Come and check this. This is my first time to take a photo. Is it good? Yes, very good. Take it. It's souvenir for you. Well, I'd better get going. - Be careful of driving. - OK. Let's go. No. I am sorry. I thought I saw something. Did I do wrong in my past life? Why things go wrong everytime? Excuse me? Do you believe in past life? Can I ask you something? Please send me one of my stuffs that I left on you. That's from our time at university... I can't sleep. Don't be late for breakfast. Let's go, doggy. Thank you for coming all the way. I'm Gen. Park. Hope you have a good time here. It's short for 2 days though. And, please seize this beautiful view with your eyes and hearts together. Yes. We started this farm stay a year ago. I suggested it first. Because dad seemed Ionely and we have a plenty of empty rooms. But now, dad is more into it. Last night... Excuse me of last night. I don't get drunk easily. Can I ask you something? What? What did you see that night? You told me you saw sometihng. That was... a warrior on horse. Horse? My dear, my dear? Take your breath and hold it. And, hold your bow at 45 degree. Don't shoot it in hurry. Both of you and bow can be hurt. My dear! Any volunteer to try it out? It looks difficult. Give it a shot. - Me? No, thank you. - Go and give it a shot! Do I shoot now? Are you OK? I'm fine. I just feel dizzy. I'm sorry. It's OK, my dear. Dinner is ready. - Wow, it looks very delicious. - Did you make everything Gen. Park? Yeah. By the way, why do people call you Gen. Park? Don't you think I look exactly like Mr. General? - Anyway, nice to meet you all. - Nice to meet you, too. Cheers. My dear. This is the famous Andong beef, not imported meat. Please accept my apology in sending wedding invitation by SMS. Hope you come and wish us the best. SMS death will and even wedding invitation... I told you she's not for you. You'd better let go. Don't say that. She's for me. Don't you get it? She sent you wedding invitation. Anyway, I'll come down to see you soon. Understood? I get going. Talk to you later. Wait! I met someone today and I feel like marrying her. Check her out. Isn't she great? What wedding you mean? Hello. Uh? He hanged upon me? I'm so sorry. It took so long. What were you about to say? Your past life. You're right. My past life... Do you like rainy day? Yes. You feel stuffy when weather is dry. Dry weather drives you crazy, right? Exactly. Amazing! I can't stand dry weather. So, what's my past life? Earthworm. No, it can't be. I see. Don't touch me. In-woo, hurry up. Turn and close it. And, push the shutter button. It's easy. I'll take a picture of you. Where's In-woo? My dear has some business in Seoul today. She's gone already. Your package arrived yesterday. I forgot to give it to you. Thank you. When did you arrive? Just now. Are you off, tomorrow? Hold it up a little more. More! Turn it further outward. - Turn it more? - Yes. We're ready. Please sit down. Everything's OK? Yes. Granpa, look here. Can you adjust your collar? Yes. Arert you hungry? Let's have dinner out. Is it OK that your father is waiting for us to come for dinner? Arert you fed up with my father's foods? Since you left me, honey, there's no one help me with this. Wow, this is real ancestral food table. Yes, help yourself. So do you. You worked hard for me today. My pleasure. I really enjoyed it. How long have you done this? Taking a picture for a portrait of the deceased? Yes. It's been long since I did it at university. Something wrong? No. You seem to go to Seoul often. Not quite often. Just once a month. Is that for business? No. Just for regular checkups. Pardon? Are you done? Let's get some air. Good. I'm on my way home. Talk to you later. Your father called? Yes. I think, your father really care about you a lot. He overprotects me. He always says that he owed me a lot in past life. Past life? He's just saying. My mom passed away when I was little. He felt sorry that I should grow up without mother. He didn't have to feel sorry. Rather, I should thank him. Whenever I walk along this stone wall, I imagine people from Chosun Dynasty show up at the corner. Sound stupid, isn't it? Not at all. I told you I saw a warrior on horse the other day. I understand how you felt like. I feel like that long time ago, someone stood here and saw the same moon like us. I am not sure if they saw the moon here or not. But, I am sure the moon gets you tender feeling. Here you are. Whatsoever, who remember that? Pardon? Nothing. Dad. Did you eat? Of course. It's past dinner time. You know you're late? What? I asked to let me help him. Actually, I want to see you to ask you something. Ask. You graduated from Dongkuk University? What? And, you joined the photo club when you were freshman. Right? Ah, you're right. I knew it. From now on, I can sleep well. What are you talking about? You told me that we haven't met before. But, we've met before. I went to the same university. Not all students at the same university know each other. Did you already know we went to the same university? I didn't think, it's important. Well, I went to the university but, I couldn't graduate. That's why you didn't tell me that? Nothing important. Maybe... So, you want me to call you senior? Did you take these pictures? Of course, I did. Where? This photo's taken on the alley when I arrived at your house in Andong. Teacher, hurry up. Watch your steps. Two, three, OK! - Class dismissed - Yayyy. Have fun! Yes. Can you turn around? Please smile. Wow, it looks great! Did you make this by yourself? Of course, I did. Yes? Museum pictures? Yes, he's here. Yes. Can we ask you a favor to take pictures of university museum for PR brochure? Yes, my pleasure. Mr. Senior... Actually, I have something to tell you. Something to tell me? Hello? Take it easy. I'll call you back soon. I'm sorry. I got something urgent in Seoul and have to go. It's OK. Have a nice trip. Thank you. What? Have a sweet dream, tonight. You sound cheesy. - Good night. - Good night. Hello? Soo- Yeon I'm sorry. Earlier I was panicked cuz we fought over wedding gifts. Wedding gifts? You know, brides are nervous before a wedding. And, we release the stress to family and close friends. Family and close friends? You know me better. Don't you think you're cruel to me. We were in love. I'm sorry. Who asked you to come down? Hi. Are you home now? I'll call you back. I'm taking a shower. I know. I love you, too. Mr. HwANG called a day. He has a urgent business in Seoul and can't have a class today. Does he need to make up the class? Yes. He's coming back tomorrow? It's sunny day! Mom. Why? Is there anyone bullying you here? What do you mean? Everybody is nice to me. You look tired than before. Any worrisome? Mom. If I were born again, it'd be better to be a woman. They don't trust my mental ability or what... I need guardiars approval in order to apply this. Mom! Why do you want this? Organ donor is good thing. I am not sure how long I can live. I want to do something good before the end of my life. Don't do this to me. It's a bit much, mom. I am not doing this to give you hard time. I didn't mean to hurt you. Think about your dad. If there had been an organ donor, he wouldn't have died. So what, now? I know, it won't make him alive. But, that's why I want it more. I've never done good things for others. But, I wish I could do it even after I die. So, please sign on it. Do it for me. So, did you sign on it? Yes. What should I do? She really wanted it. Not a single woman, here. What? Nothing. By the way... what about your life in Andong? You seem to settle down there. You have a girlfriend there? What? Yourjunior colleague from the same university! How did you know that? It's me with the third eye. Actually, I have something to tell you. Shit! You shit on me? - No, Sir. I didn't mean it. - Then, what did you mean? Hey, take it easy. I told you I didn't mean it. What? Don't stop me! I'm sorry. It's all misunderstanding. Stop! Don't stop me! - I'm sorry. - Don't stop me! Even an earthworm will respond to your action. Earthworm! You son of bitch! I'm not an earthworm. You drive me crazy. How many times I have to tell you I am a victim. That son of bitch... They picked on me first. Hey, stop it. Hey you! Yeah? - I feel stuffy without raining. - Is he your friend, right? He's so called... a friend of mine but, older than me. I've been listening and seeing it for 4 and half hours... - Shit. I keep telling you. - Get him away! - Can I charge my cellphone? - Yes. Hey you, earthworm! Wriggle, wriggle. Hey, mister. Wait a minute. Have we met before? This phone is turned off. Please leave your message... Hey doggy. He's not coming home today. What shall I do? I know, I know. You think, I deserve a better guy. But, he's the one I like. Are you OK? I think, I am punished. What's up? You're such a player that nothing gets you down. Sorry. About what? Everything. Actually, I had something to tell you when you come back to Seoul. What's that? Not now... I'll visit you in Andong and then, talk about this there. Mr. PARK Seung-Hwan & Mr. HwANG Eun-Gyo. You can go. Mister, wake up! - What the hell... - wake up! Hey. I'm home, In-woo and Gen. PARK. All began on that day, 5 years ago. What's wrong? You have only 30 days till SAT. Do you really want to be stuck in far countryside? If you don't study, you can't even be around Seoul. Open your text book again. It's 257 page. In-woo, you may go home. Yeah? I can do it. Really? Bye. What are you doing? Study hard! In-woo, is your class finished? Why? Do you want me to be a dumb in good health? Yes. My dear, come with me. Tired? Give me your backpack. Actually, thanks to overprotective dad, I could graduate in good health. That was my wish though... Instead of an university in Seoul, I had to go to the hospital in Seoul. Hello. This is my uncle's house where I stay for medical checkups. - Good to see you. - It was my first time that I left Andong and visited Seoul. You're grown-up and pretty now. It's my cousin, once our family's shame. Just a moment! Hey, hurry up! What's going on? After 5 times trials for SAT, he finally got in the university and became loving son again. He's the one who gave my cousin the funny nickname, old hag. Can you chin up little more? - That's what I found out later though. - Me? Listen to him. OK, be ready. One, two. Three. Dad wanted me to go to an university around our hometown. But, I didn't. Cuz it was my first chance to have my own freedom. And, I didn't want to miss it. I finally could make it to the same university with my cousin. Give all the books returned just before. We are asked for 3 to 3 blind date. Let's go! I can't. I have to go for part time job. No way, they are prep students of flight attendant. I heard they're hot. Wait a minute. They are all your type with long straight black hair. You make sure that we are the same age of freshman. Smile, please. My anticipation of college life did end shortly before a year. My dear. - You wake up? - In Andong, An old tomb was excavated on the construction site of housing. According to the local academy, remains of the tomb such as love letters and shoes threaded of womars hair dated 400 years ago and once belonged to LEE Eung-Tae. Especially, the love letters were written by his devoted wife who had longed for her deceased husband forever. I don't know since when I have had the same dream. Maybe, it's after I watched the news on TV. But, unexplainable sadness lingered even after I woke up. I got better after I returned to Andong. But, I had to go to the hospital in Seoul, once a month. It was the day for hospital when it happened. It says we must chance upon our destined love someday. If the chances are repeating, they tend to become destiny. But, I couldn't wait doing nothing. Instead, ask and it will be given to me. People say you can create your own love. Or is that what destiny means? - And, I might not be able - In-woo. To have much time left. Coincidence or destiny? I happen to know the right person for the photo class. Don't worry. I'll let him call you to talk about the job. Can I give him your contact number? - Sure. - OK. You didn't know? She collapsed again. She might be in critical condition. So, she was moved to Seoul. No. Can you believe that I have had the same dream? The dream repeated over and over. How come I realized our destiny too late? What the dream meant and, who the lady with long hair was in the dream? Long long time ago, a lady was chased by someone. The lady who looked exactly like you was me in the past life. In our past life, I was you and you were me. Let her go free just once for me. She's the one I love. She's just a child of the traitor. If you don't tell anybody, nobody knows she's the child of the traitor. I'm sorry. I already knew who she is. If you get in my way, I can't let you go, either. I see... If you insist, then, I have no other choice. You couldn't imagine how happy I was only because you always stood behind me. Whenever you felt gloomy, my heart was aching. Whenever you smiled, my heart was shined. Whenever I thought about you, I was happy even in agony. But, I was useless for your pain. There's belief that we could be reborn to our beloved one, if we truly love and long for the one. So, I've decided I wouldn't lose you like this again, if I could be born once more. I've sworn I would protect my love even by sacrificing my life. Why did you make Do you want to do good thing alone? Let me join you. And, you're my guardian. Thank you... It's reported that a Korean medical operation team succeeded in the organ transplantation of unprecedentedly complicated case. A patient, who had been suffered from multiple malfunctions, was transplanted with heart, kidneys and lung altogether from one donor. Excuse me... Have we met before? Yes. Try to remember... In 1998, an old tomb was found on the construction site in Andong. It was the tomb of a man who died at early age, 420 years ago. In the tomb, love letters by his devoted wife were buried together with shoes threaded of the wife's own long black hair. The love letters and the shoes have been exhibited at the museum of Andong Univ.
