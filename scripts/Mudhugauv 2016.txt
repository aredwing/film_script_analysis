We told him mice!! Well done! What did he say? 'Oh my God! Don't hit me! Don't hit me!' Did he cy like that? Yea! Exactly!! He asked us how much we charged for our services. And what did you say? l said it was 10,OOO rupees! Then what did he say? He said he'll give us 20,OOO ifwe broke both your arms! Such fun, right? And we told him we'll do it, if he paid an advance! Laugh!! - Come on, laugh!! You didn't take the advance from him, right? Hey! How can we do that! Isn't that wrong? We took the full amount! Shall we start then? Laugh! What is this? l'll show you right away! Don't hit me!! You son ofa gun!! Do you know who does the most number of car deals in South India? Yea! Who is it? - Hyundai!

Ramesh, until this car reached here, it was yours. But now, it is mine! Sir, but... So ifyou want this car in this same form, you'll have to buy it from me! Aer giving you an owner's discount, it will be around Rs.10 lakhs! So ifyou don't bring the cash immediately, you'll have to buy dierent parts ofthis car from Tamil Nadu 8 Karnataka and elsewhere.. So.. See you then! And yea, if you go to the police, l won't pay their commission. Tell me! Rambo? Police? What happened? - Live? Switch on the TV! The incident occured during the traic regulation by the Police, to facilitate the ministefs 'People Welfare March!' The problems began when the famous businessman Rambo was stopped on his way. Cl Padmanabhan 8 co from Samudrakani police station were the ones who stopped Rambo. Rambo, who has influence in the police 8 the government, was stopped forcefully by Cl Padmanabhan. Forthe next few days, all the meetings should be fixed here. Ramakrishnan, Even you'd have forgotten your original name now! But there's a name you would never forget. Thambi. My elder brother! l was waiting patiently, Ramakrishnan! For your downfall to begin. And l saw it today.. Whoever you threatened and built up this empire ofyours, they would all laugh at you! You will lose eveything, and this Rambo will go back to being the old Ramakrishnan Bonakkad. On that day, l shall come. To settle our scores! 'Cl Padmanabhan tried to assault Rambo by pulling him forcefully out ofthe car# He said that no one can influence the police; and that he had to take this action because they were disrupting his duty. Disney, l want him! Thambi, right? Done! No! That policeman! Padmanabhan! l enquired about him. His nickname is Padayappa. Long back, when the movie 'Padayappa' released, a bunch ofyoung kids beat him up badly in the theater. That's how he got the name - Padayappa. lt's better that we don't do anything directly now. The incident is still a hot topic, right? Let these channel guys cool down. He will fall right into our trap. And then we can use a frontman, and finish him! One tight slap! What's this mess on your face? Mom!! (Kisses) So it was you who was shown on TV? On TV? Didn't you see? The first priM went to Ganga - Bharath team. How was your VIVA? Vey nice!! Full marks for sure! You said the same thing Iast time as well. There's just one month Ieft for the final exams. Do remember that! lfyou roam around doing such paintjobs, Don't wory, my dear mom!! Go wash your face! Who's that girl? Does she study with you? No!! Found her on the road! Anyway, she looks really graceful. That graceful girl's name is - Ganga. Don't tell me you ended up kissing her also! Huh? Did that come on TV too? No! l stopped kissing people whom l don't know. That'll be good for you! You don't have to get to know people you don't know now! No!! Brother! Bro!! What do you want? Then move! Let me complete this. Why is eveyone doing the same penon's face? Why don't you sculpt my face, Ganga? Didn't you say that the face you were searching for, was mine? This is our assignment! And he is our model. You please move! Okay. After this, can you sculpt my face like this? Stop disturbing me and leave! Please! l won't disturb you. l'll just say one thing and leave. What? l liked you instantly when l saw you that day! Even my mom likes you. Mom saw us on TV. And since you already like me, shall we fix this? Liked you? When? What do you mean, when? You were ogling at me that day, right? And then you met me and said that my face is good; and that you liked me! Didn't you? l didn't mean it in that way! What's the other meaning for 'l like you'? Do you know only one meaning for 'l like you'? Then tell me the other meaning! What's that? Pick one ofthese. l don't want to! Then l won't leave from here. Pick one! So you like me! 'Remember this face?' Evey good looking girl will have one such friend! And she'll be the one who screws up eveything! We'll meet herwhen this one's not there! Ganga, Ganga, look at me! Yea! Tell me! Look at me! Did you see that couple? Don't look quickly. Slowly.. Saw them? Yes. Why? That couple is not that great, right? Not as great as? l mean.. as much as us! But, we are not a couple, right? No.. But still, we aren't that bad either! None ofyourtricks are going to workwith me, dear! Then why don't you think this way? What are the chances of a guy like me getting a girl like you? Actually, this is an interesting question. See! So what are the chances? Tell me! 1110? 11100? 111000? 1110000? No! 1 out of 1 lakh? 1 in ten million? So there is a chance, right? Son, can you li this for me? Come! Please help me! Fine? - Yes! Don't follow me again saying the same thing! Give me a good reason for not liking me? My dad won't allow! All that's later, right? l'll take care of it! That's not for later.. That is my primay reason! We don't have to get married without your dad's permission! But is that a reason not to fall in love? No! But what if my dad objects ae we fall in love? l will convince him! Or else, we can wait till he's convinced! There are many other reasons as well! Then tell me what they are! Err.. You have many more suppli exams to pass! What good is an engineer without 'supply's? Give me another reason! You're a fatso! But my mom says that l've lost weight! All moms say that! So will your problem be over if l become slim? There are many more reasons. Then tell me, Ganga! l don't remember any right now! Until you say that you love me, l will come and stand here daily! l don't care if it's 10 days or 10 years! Then l'll be 32 yean old and you will be 30! Son, can you please put this down for me? Titanic? Such a big hotel and such a small door? Talk loudly man! For mo. Be careful. They hold our bags for us in this hotel! Don't press it too hard. It'll break! lt's a breakable laptop. lsn't it? On which floor is it? - 1 6th. So how many would be there? - Huh? Have you reached? When it's time, you'll get a message on your mobile. Don't move! Hey! That's not a toy gun! There're bullets in it! ls it? Did he say who the guy was? - No! Then will the person who has to be shot come to us, and say 'Shoot me! Shoot me'? Didn't l tell you that this is an actual gun? He said he will text us. Oh. Okay. We don't have a name, photo or address! Where will we go shoot him? lnternational deals are like this, man! Eveything is conveyed through messages. Since we are lucky, the guy to be killed landed here from Bombay and we got this job! That's why we got such a big job! Shouldn't we live like this? lf so, we should've asked 50k extra. That's true. But l didn't think of it then. The message has come! Where? lt's ringing in your pocket! Not my pocket! - Then? lt's in your pocket! - Oh yea! Sory! It was in my pocket! l can't see anything! David's friend is calling. lt's not a toy gun! Reached? ln the li? He has reached! Come! l feel so tempted to shoot him! Come! l'll go back today itself. - Why? Okay. See you in Bombay then. lt's Rambo! Him? How are you? - Long time, right? What do you have in your hand? - Huh? There's iust one bullet. So.. aren't you going to finish me? No! Who sent you? Tell him the truth! ls it him? Me? l'm asking you. Is it him? ls it this bloody brd? - Who got shot? Are you leaving, Rambo? Bro? The gun? Who will give us the rest ofthe money? What are your names? He's Kumari and l am Putthari. l swear, we didn't know who were going to kill, until we got into the lift and realized it was you, Sir. Please let us go! He's coming here! Don't stub that cigarrette on us, please! Okay. l'll let you go! You will? Let Kutthari be here. Chaakkari, you go... and bring this person l want. North C.l. Name - Padayappa. Sir, we work together. We've never woed alone. lsn't it? - Yes. Okay. You both can go. Will he come, ifwe call him? He should come! Phew! We got our lives back! Shall we escape without going to the station? lfwe don't do what he said, he will find us 8 kill us! He won't show such mercy then! Don't scare me, man!! This is a big trap we're in! Why does he have to make us call him? Can't he call him directly? No man! This is a plan, to kill that man! - Plan? lf we call him, we'll be the ones who'll get caught! Remember David? His same plan! lf so, what ifwejoin the police's side like we tricked David 8joined Rambo? Rambo is much more influential than the police here. Even ifwe join the police's side, we can't trust them! They are frauds! Then what do we do? We'll see. Come! l've lost my peace of mind! Ask for a li! Hey, please stop! - What is it, bro? Can you give us a lift? Only mo people can go, right? - Only mo are going! Dude, what was his name? Rajnikanth? lt's Padayappa! Oh yea, Padayappa! Where's the stand? By the way, we don't have to go in together. - Then? l'll go. Why should you go? lf you go, you'll screw it up. l'll go, call him nicely 8 come. You stay here! Go! What is this? Sleeping centre? Eveyone's sleeping, huh? Bro! Hey, Sir! lt's saying something! lt's saying something! Don't you want it? l'm keeping it here! Oh! He's sleeping! Sir, Padayappa? Padayappa is your dad!! What happened? - Something blew up inside! You got what you asked for, right? Hey Kumaari. Padayappa is his nickname. His original name is Padmanabhan. Couldn't you tell me this earlier? l could've avoided a slap. Padmanabhan Sir? Padmanabhan Sir is at West Fort! - Where's that, Sir? Hey, what's the matte What? What's the matter? l was asked to take that Sirto someone. Take him to someone? - Yes. To whom? - Rambo! Who? Rambo! - Haven't you heard about him? Long, white hair and all.. No, Sir. Please! l'll wait outside. But l'll leave from here only with him. Did you get scared? Can 3 people go on this? That's ok. He's a policeman. We can go triples! There's someone else outside, along with him. Sir, didn't l tell you that day itselfthat it'll be a big problem? They are Rambo's men! You do one thing. Go home right away, Sir. l will handle them. Yea right! And then l will be the one to get screwed! Where's he going? - Start the bike! Who are you? Are you here to bribe Padayappa? lfyou're here to bribe Padayappa, then give it to me. Are you here to beat him? Then do that directly! Looks like he has set his eyes on my bottle! Dude, Padayappa has escaped. You come through the other side. Brother, give him a couple of extra poundings from me! Hey Kumaari, what the hell happened over there? This started off like a Shaji Kailas film, but now its like a Priyadarshan film. l don't understand anything! ls he dead? Shall l go enquire? Yea right! We don't know anything. Let it be like that. lf he isn't dead, will he come searching for us? Both him and the Police will come. That's for sure! KISS! ls he out of his mind? Let it be. But where is he now? There's no report of him checking into any hospital. Still.. can someone be attacked by kissing? What C.l. Sir said is true. There are eye-witnesses! Where are those eye-witnesses? Notiust that. Many such cases have been reported in foreign countries. And that boy? We don't know who he is, Sir. l'll tell you, Sir. l don't know who that boy is, Sir. There you go! What the hell were you doing? Do you at least have any idea about the guys who followed you? No, Sir. You don't know that too? But if l see them again, l can recogniM them! lfyou see, you can recognize! As ifthey're going to come in front ofyou evey morning, and do a fashion parade saying 'please recogniM us!' Fool! Moron! We don't even know if Rambo is dead or alive. ln case he's alive, it's sure that he'll come searching forthat boy. lf we can track that boy, we can nab Rambo with all the evidence! lt's not that easy to get rid of Rambo. Find those 'quotation' guys and that boy immediately! Anyway, you go ahead with this. Get some new guys from the Police training camp as well. But still, how can someone attack anyone by kissing? The urine bladder has been destroyed by the bullet. So he cannot control his urine! lt'll keep on flowing out. l've attached a urine bag. That means? Wherever he goes, he'll have to cary the urine bag with him. Sheesh! How can he go around carying a urine bag? When will his condition get better? A complete cure in this case is not possible immediately. Apart from urinating, nothing is else is possible with this organ! Don't move or shake rapidly. Don't strain yourself under any circumstance! There will be bleeding! There are high chances of it being infected. Then the only option would be to chop it o! But in this condition, he cannot travel by flight. There will be bleeding if there's air pressure. And it can't be said how the body would react during climate change. Sir, Thambi... He is tired both mentally and physically! So, ifthere's strain, he can even lose his mind! Then he will start doing really weird things. Even otherwise, he is a little eccentric. Then we have to be vey careful. (Kisses) l want him!! Sir, Thambi? Padayappa? Then? l want that son of a bh who kissed me! lfyou can't do it, tell me!! l'll find him! Bring eveyone you have a doubt on! Get lost!! Ganga, Where were you all this while? l was tying to jump over a wall. - Ganga, Yes, mom! - Take your clothes inside. Coming!! Mom is calling. l'll be right back. Don't leave now, Ganga! Huh? l said don't leave!! You're in form today, huh? l need a kiss. (kisses) Sheesh! l don't want it overthe phone. l want it directly! Okay. You come here. l'll give you! l'm already here! Open the door! What? Open! Where? Where are you? Outside. - Outside? Where? - On top of the wall! Top ofthe wall? Where? Come to the other side ofthe balcony. - Where? First come to the balcony. Saw me now? Where's my kiss? - Here? You? Go!! Somebody will see you! Whateveryou say, l won't go unless l get a kiss! Gosh!! - Someone broke it! What's that? Come here! - Hold my hand! ls it a thieR No way! Which thiefwould dare to break into my house! Who's that? Clicking photos? Walk!! Go inside!! Don't push me!! l'll shut up ifyou kiss me! Wake up!! What are you doing here? Where? - In my house! You idiot!! This is my house! Oh my God! Why am l here? So you don't remember anything? - Ganga? Yes! Coming, mom! - Have you woken up? Go!! Go fast! Open the door. - Shut up 8 come fast! Dad is there downstairs. How'll you go? You come with me. Let's see. What are you going to do? They will see us! What's that fo - Go down. Careful! Oh! How come you're early today? Come! Stay here. What? - We're trapped! We can't go back inside. Mom will come out any minute! Wait! See! These are our children! What good is such children!! Who is it? l came to give this book to Ganga, uncle! ls it? - Yes, dad! Then take it! What's that? Nothing, dad! l should be slapped for giving you this job! They are the only evidence against Rambo! You have to find that boy and those guys immediately! Did you get any details about Rambo at least? No, Sir. What the hell were you investigating for all these days then? Even though l couldn't get any details on Rambo, l've got some other details related to this case. What details? There are reports of boys bemeen the age of 18-22 going missing from various parts ofthe city, Sir. So? There are chances that Rambo might be behind this. How? l don't understand! Even he wouldn't have traced that boy. That must be why he's kidnapping boys ofthat age group, and tying to identify him! What did he do to those boys who were kidnapped? From what l heard, he is a psycho! No one can predict what he does, and how or when he does it! Come forward. Do you know how to hug? H.. h.. hug? Do you know how to hug? l know! Do you know how to hug? - Yes. l know. Do you know how to kiss? Huh? Do you know how to kiss? l know! Stop cying! lfyou cy, l'll kill you, you dog! Hug me!! Slowly. Not him as well! One silly kid who's not even old enough as my career... lfyou can't even find him, what's the use of having you all? l think l know the guy whom you're searching for! God! l mean.. l know someone who kisses vey well! Dude, l have an idea! - What? What ifwe catch that boy for Rambo? And then? Rambo will leave us alone then, right? He will leave us alone. But what about that Padayappa? He will kill us. l'm sure! l have another idea! - That's enough! Let me say it. What if it's good? Then say! What ifwe show Rambo's Iocation to Padayappa? And then? Then they'll settle their scores themselves, right? What ifthey don't? They will settle their score with us! Shall l say an idea? Yea. Tell me. Shall we search for that boy? lsn't this what l told you earlier? - That was earlier, right? What l'm saying is that we'll go in different directions. There's no point in sticking together. So as soon as you find him, call me. l can't walk too much! Sure? l'll call you. You should also call me. Find him, okay? - Yes. Okay then.. Such torture this is. Dude, stop!! Come here! Any change in plans? -A small change. You go this way. l'll go that way. Why? - There's a lot to walk this way. Call me immediately when you find him, okay? You iust got lucky! ls this dude the one l have to kiss? He would require at least a double dose of kisses! Dude! Hey dude! What happened to you? Mom, What happened to him? He's been sitting there stunned from the time he came! You ask him younelf what happened. lf you won't tell anyone, l'll tell you. Yea. Tell me! A rich gay man kidnapped me, threatened me and made me kiss him! You kissed him? And then? He didn't like my kiss! l felt sad for him and called Komalan for him. l got this in return for that! What's the important thing you wanted to say? Usually, this is supposed to be a good news. But.. For us.. this is a bad news! What's that news? Give it to me! What? Kiss! Just one kiss! That day? Yes! That day! l slept offtoo soon! l iust remember one kiss! With that, you won't be pregnant! No! l'm really scared! Don't be tensed! Let me think. Are you thinking of a name for the child? One tight slap! Get lost man! What's wrong with him? How did you confirm this? l've been vomiting for the past 2 days. That must be due to something else! Not just that, my belly is also growing! You're iust imagining things! No! It's really growing! With that you confirmed it? l checked in Google. This is it! l'm sure! But that day, nothing like that.. l shouldn't be walking so fast in this condition. My dear Ganga, stop scaring me saying this again and again! Who else should l talk to about our child? We'll go to some hospital 8 check! There's no need for that. - Then? Are you going to give birth to that baby? That's why l said so. Let us confirm this fint! And think about the rest later. Till then, don't get so worked up! For the time being, don't tell this to anyone. We'll figure a way out. That kiss that day is the reason for all this! What do we do now? This is all this guy does orwhat? l had warned you then only! You better drop me back home! Why? Can't you take an auto? lt's said that travelling by auto should be avoided during the first 3 months! Looks like you'll end up having the baby! Then? What should l do? - One kick l'll give you! Who tells you all this nonsense? l downloaded a pregnancy app on the mobile.. Your bloody app!! - Gosh! My phone! Where did he go? Brother! Me? - Can you give me your phone? To make a call. Please! Don't think that you can escape leaving me alone. l didn't do this alone!! So we will suertogether! Until you tell me that you'll mary me, l'll stand here! Even if it takes 10 days or even 10 yean! Then you will be 32, and l'll be 30! And ourchild will be 9! Just rememberthat! Shall l go? l got his number!! Come! Where's your gun? No! No! l give up!! l'll kick you all day, you bloody dog!! Hello? Dude, l got that Emraan Hashmi's number! Police? Which police? Sir, he cut the call. l think he must have escaped! Now we'll have to make this one speak the truth! Stand up! Sir, please don't do anything to him. Then you come here directly. We'll talk about the rest once you are here. What's the case, Sir? You'll come here only if you know what's the case? Sir, you please give the phone to Padmanabhan Sir. Leave me! Sir, he wants to tell you something! To me? - Go! Sir, it wasn't us who tried to kill you. It was Rambo! We'll decide all that once you reach the station! Sir, you please leave him alone. l'll show you where Rambo is!! You don't have to do such big things! Just come here directly! Hey, he cut the call again! lf so, we will roll this guy over the rod, Sir! lt's all a mess now! A car is coming! Get out, l say! Who are you?
