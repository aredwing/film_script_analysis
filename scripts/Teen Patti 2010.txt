I will be patiently waiting for you. Your Perci Trachtenberg, Chairman! Department of Applied Mathematics. University of Cambridge. You must be Venkat... Subarmaniam! Would you belive it, for this name... I practise alot to call this name in the mirror. Well to be honest! It wasn't easy for me to call Perci Trachtenberg. You just said it? Any problem to find this place. Not at all. But these kind of places most often embarasses me, So, I heard right. So, shall we go? Okay! I feel very strange to recieve your letter. I am... I am really unknown from your job since many years. And it's really pleasure for me to meet you. Like others you're in illusion. It's not a big difference. Between madness and brilliance, it's upto you what you want to show. I've heard you are a clever player. It won't be good that I disappoint you. But... I don't play anymore. What happen? Logic defeat Magic. That's what I have to ask you, Perci! Can I ask you question? You may... I know that you... ...were a succeed magician earlier. Then how a magicain could become a mathematician. You know what more is interesting. What? How a mathemaician suddenly become... Camera! It's just a matter of chance. Put electric fenses all over the campus. And on every 30 meter... a hidden camera. Don't mind but students of these age. Are always misfire in these kind of diciplinary measures. Everyone is not like you. You are one in million. I want weekly reports quickly. Ideas should have some applications. Did you understand my thesis. Your every paper is already rejected. You will be retire in 3 years. You should be greatful unless you have this job. It seems that technology institute turns to agriculture. During festival where these professors takes cut. We have found during sting operation. That they all are gone in Dean's party. I am here, Speak for the others. Would you tolerate for lifetime, Will you marry me? Please! But you won't understand. And why would you understand. Are you drunk? First get some drink, then get some cigarette, then drugs, that's what we came here to do, and do you know the results. What if your father will know? What it seems it doesn't exist. And what doesn't exist. That could be. Actually, I was waiting for congratulations. Since I have become Dept head. It's only you who didn't congratulate me. I just forgot you. What suggestions you have submitted to dean. Regarding department's improvement. I read them. But don't mind. I have different plans regarding department's improvement. Now it's just a matter of professor's relationship. We will play a game to understand this. Three bowls or you can suppose it 3 doors. I am putting a car. Three doors. And there is a car behind one of them, Let's shuffle it. Shuffle it. Now if you have to choose a door, then which one you will choose. We won't open it. That randomly we should open any door, let's open A. If you have to change you first choice then... would you like to change it. Let's see who is right? Aparna or Sid. We always have to change our first choice, Most probably we have seen that our choice is more often wrong. They are taking maths class on tennis court. In educational institutions like us. You know what maths department means. To less some burdon of mental hospital. We have our living example like Mr. Venkat. And what about us? Do you have cards? How are you? I was about to call you. 3 lakhs are remaining on you from three months. Lakh! My guys are coming to your place. It's not a simple case to get 100% scholarship. Let's go to Oris this evening. Someone is here. Let's meet in the evening. One minute. I am Pandey! Do you know Mr. Praveen. You know? I came from there. Why do you make problems? Come on give me the money. What's the mess? What are you doing from past few days. I'll tell you. Bring three students in class room in next ten minutes. This hand will win. We have two kings and they could be three. But it's not a game of memory. Sir, shuffler doesn't make problem. If I watch two games or two hands. I could predict about cards. This game is yours. It's a magic. No! It's not a magic, It's mathematics. My mind is racing. If we play more few games. Why don't we try it in real random situation. Then we will find out that your theory is working. This game was on internet. There are many places where these games are being playing professionaly, Sir, you give me 2 days. And I will arrange everything. How come? You came to meet me. What happen? What happen to oris? I am waiting from 4 hours. We were supposed to go restaurant tomorrow not tonight. Check out I have send you message. Limit is limit. I just proposed you and you can't be angry. Good Morning! How are you? It seems this place doesn't clean from many weeks. I will send Laxmi here. Did you start gambling. House is clean, you don't need to send Laxmi. Dust! Don't know why you men can't see dust. Professor Kale was also like you. I remember once. I went to Kanpur. When I came back and I saw my house was very dusty, I asked to professor what is this? And he said what? It means he didn't saw dust. I agree this housewife job is out of reach for professors. Did you submit your research paper. Reject! Again! I knew it. It happens. Same thing happend with Mr. Kale. They don't know about genius people. You know what Professor Kale said about you. He said if it would be america. Then Professor Venkat would get Noble Prize yet. You made me busy with chat. What paper I have submitted, that's gone rejected. Because what I can see our respected Mr. Dean can't see. We have to change our names and identity. And it has two reasons. First if we will go like this. And the second thing is... They shouldn't know our real identity at any cost. We will go like those people who visits these kind of people. And we will go seperatly. You all will sit on different tables. And then Mr. Venkant will come to your tables. And you will tell them, that which cards you have, You will tell Mr. Venkant that which cards you have, and He would tell you that... who is going to win the game on that table. Do we have to change the identity. Sir, I will go as Badru. Sid! You will come next. Then I will tell you that on which table you have to sit and play. Our campus dry cleaner Dal Chand. I will come to wear that shirt. Are you walking in garden? Which kind of girls come over there? Sir, we can't take here there. It's out of her reach. What do you mean I can't do it. It's just an experiment and if Sid and Vikram can do that. Then I can also do that. It's risky. And we can't take this chance. What's wrong with you? Do you know which kind of girls come over there? You always underestimate me. What's wrong? You know that's not the right place for girls. Girls have to make their place. We will practice these signals daily for an hour. Because the most important thing is as much we prepared, something is out of our control. Which kind of place is this? It's a social club. You will find all card players here. They all are genius in maths but they didn't even know. Sir, we are doing it all for your research. I shouldn't go there. It was necessary to examine my theory, You can better understand that any invention how difficult to examine in practical life. Was that the only reason or something else. I didn't know you are going to examine me here. I thought... we will talk only friendly. Sometimes I become little bit excited. You know there is no big difference between Genius and Crazy, Not like I thought. Then what did you thought? Don't give me the answer. I don't want to know. You tested your theory. I have never seen you before. Do you know why my name is Dabru Seth. I always carry pistol. Teach him swimming. We will play bigger game. Winner will take all. It's my lucky game, and I will must win. He narrated you joke, Now laugh! I will must win. You messed up everything. Give me the money. What do you think? What is this nonsense. It's all my fault. If he didn't have gun today. Then I would kill him. We made many mistakes what we have to rectify. First of all we shouldn't go to our own car. Next time we won't go. Sir, do you know. We have earned lot of money. What that Dagru took. Yes! The most important thing is... I don't want to do this research. Sir, My papa tool loan for my studies. He always cursed me for that. I want to pay my own fees with that money. And if we will get some money then my life will be change. Sir, game was closed because of me, Slr, give us one more chance. No! I will do my research my own. Sir, after retirment this money will help you. We done all for research. Where this money come from? They will reject your paper again. Like they always done. I knew the cards. They were talking to me. Phone call for you. Look! I think you have dial wrong number. Number is right and man too. You are Venkant speaking. You played well tonight. Now do some social work. Now I need share for every game. Who are you? Now listen to me. I need 2 lac for each game. If not 2 lac then that cute guy, Siddharth Baja, I will break his legs. Do you understand. And don't tell anyone about this. Who was he? It is not a joke? Only we 5 people knew about the game. Then who was he? Victoria talkies. You will play your next game there. Whatever you do think and decide. Now danger was increasing, Yes indeed. What did you think? What should I say? Answers... could be many. It means nothing was decided but it was... Why you didn't go to police. I can't put my students in danger. And one of them, could be responsible for that. Then what did you tell them to start the game? I said I need money. And they agreed. 2 lac for sir. Suppose it royality for theory. I have invested one lac. So this one lac is mine, Now the rest is one lac. It means everyone's share is 25000. Today I have become a rich guy. It's just a beginning. But after today we will just put our prize amount. What is this? I thought share will be equal. But if we won then just because of Mr. Vekant. Forget about the money. Then we won't need him anymore. Who? You and me. Me? Do you think I can do it. Because still... You can do acting. I am falling in love. With this game. First time in life I realize. That I want to win. Everything. I don't want to lose. Someone is following us. And we will never caught. I was afraid. And I wanted to know that finally who was black mailing me. To pay 2 lacs. I reached that place what was decided. I didn't know who I am going to face. Hey, Leave the bag and go. I thought someone is watching me everytime. Lot of money. I am a bheem (Winner) I can do anything. How much will you take to drop on bus stop. I am Dhaniram's friend. This gulabo doesn't know what is fear? Gulabo just know love. What the hell? Who are you? This Vikram is so weird. It's house full in heaven. No room for you. You won't seen again here. I am billu. Aren't you chillam's man? That must be someone else. Where I have seen you? Didn't seen on suzie's place. And that aparna? Keep you eyes away from her. And if try to make any trouble. What name you told? Joti Prakash Pandey. By the way my mom's name is Joti. And father's name is Prakash. Did money losted in auto. Or have been stolen. Have you gone mad? How did you come there? What are you trying to say? I lost money. You are the responsible whatever happened there. Now we can't go there. Everyone is recognizing us. And they all know that we all are together. Everything is finished. I really needed that money. Game is just started. It's going to be started. What do you think about these places? I can take you such places, where you can win in one night In fact in one game, what you didn't won yet. And more than that. What are you trying to say? As much you can think as bigger you can win. If game is bigger then obviously danger will be bigger. Camera will be everywhere. Are you explaining or scaring us. Wait! In these parties. Mostly rich people will be there. Who have enough money that they don't care if they win or lose. If there are influencial people then security will more but... You guys are gone mad. You don't understand anything. Sir, let's go. It will be fun. Fun! Whose fun? How much fun? You may be right, You need this money, No! You told me by yourself. I really don't need money. We won't play. When you needed money then we played. Now we need money and you are getting back. Sir, please try to understand we need money, Specially me, Abbas is a rich guy. Sir, leave it all. Sir, we will win in one night we might don't need to play again. You know hindi too. His name was Tarun Vachunda. Now he became Tony Milano. He is such a big playboy. Have you seen Mr. Vekant, I don't think he is here. You find him. Sir, I can't see Mr. Vekant anywhere. He might didn't come. Now what should we do? Your place or mine. I thought sir won't come. No! There is some problem that he didn't come. But where he is? Sir, where you have been? Have you ever sat in Victoria. Rain, Air and Victoria. Sir, you didn't answer our question, why you didn't come. I was having snacks. Sir, today was a big game. We could win many things. Losing is necessary to win. But what will you do to win alot. How much money you will earn? Isn't that enough for you? You are very intelligent. Sir, are you fine? No, I am not fine. I have a problem. A little problem. And this problem's cause... ...I have to find today. That cause is standing on my front. That cause is one of you. But who? Sir, they beat me alot. Who? Sir, who is this man who know everything about us. Phone call for you. First plenty is on your front.

Please forgive me I just steal last time I stole your papers from your hard disk... but intensions were good do you realy forgive me? Maybe your dont need the mathmatics... but mathmatics needs you Vinkat accepted himself as culprit of using his theory on wrong way he believes that after happening all this... he cant receive this award... Vinkat wanted that his papers should be denied on probability Vinkat says that he cant accept this honor... Because he lost his student during this theory. And that's what became biggest truth for him... but camrage university didn't took back his award... neither let him withdraw his research papers... To maintain this truth... that knowledge cant be destroyed... Vinkat become visiting faculty member in cambrage university. And he's still teach in his village
