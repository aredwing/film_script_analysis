When touching the scars I felt that there was a story beneath every wound. A small abnormality to me was something to contemplate. What is this? Why are you all here? Calm down, calm down... This is my territory If we settle, it means no more Yakuza trespassing into this area. They say this is their turf. Then it's our fault. You are idiots! What the hell did you say? Are you a fool?? Stop! Don't do it! Don't move! That's enough. The money on the table is payment for my men's results. We won't invade your turf again. You have received a warning. Be careful where you do business. I don't want to run into you again. I am interested in childhood traumas. How much left? Twenty thousand. This is only the interest. When will you pay every cent? Please sir, don't do this! I don't have the money to pay you now. I'll find a way to pay all of it back. So you're in love with him? It will be very difficult if you choose to do this again. There won't be a next time if I see you both together again. Remember what I said. You should go back to Japan and we won't see each other again I see. "CHOCOLATE" I've checked everything and I think she has problems with her brain development. This doll is a reminder of my father. Look after it carefully. Your daughter's condition is not that bad. Zen's condition is stable but she will need special care so that she can be as normal as possible. Some things will not come easily to her. Although time has passed, you should know, there is a reason as to why I let you go that day. It is so difficult to look after our daughter, but I am happy because when I see her, I see you. Zen is not like other kids. She needs special care and attention. My life is devoted to her. I will always love you... Zin. Zin and that Japanese are contacting each other again. What should we do? Having fun playing by yourself? Zen! Let's chat, have a seat. You're Zen? Japanese name just like her father. Can you speak Thai? What do you want? Leave her alone! Sit down! You know what this is called? Hmmm? Do you know? I said leave her alone! Let me tell you, losing a toe can change your way of life... When you walk... when you run... you're constantly reminded of the past. I should have done this to you then. so you wouldn't have to be reminded of the pain every day. Actually this place is quite convenient. It can be a bit loud, but you'll get used to it. Owww!! It hurts!! Thank you, thank you, thank you... That was Zen performing Thank you for the applause... Thank you for the encouragement... Don't be shy... Check those pockets for coins... Thank you... Thanks very much... Any more Ma'am? Thank you, thank you, thank you everybody Thanks very much... Any more coins? Thank you... How for our second performance Anybody want to test Zen's abilities? Think of it as helping out the kid. It's not taking advantage of her, come on... this way a little bit... I'll also give you a try... Zen?!? Hey!! That was a stupid thing to do! What if her hand gets chopped off? Which coward did this? Oh, I thought she was really tough. What else can she do? Nothing... It's OK, let's go... It's OK, let's go... Hey, hey hey, where are you going? Hey, hey hey, where are you going? You're dead, fat man! Don't tell Zin about your leg, OK? Are you OK? I'm OK. Hot everything can be caught in your hands. Hot everything can be caught in your hands. Let's do this, if you cannot catch it with your hands, Let's do this, if you cannot catch it with your hands, I'll yell... I'll yell... They're all gone now... all gone. Let's do this. Next time it's dangerous, I will yell... Flies! Let's do this. Next time it's dangerous, I will yell... Flies! Let's do this. Next time it's dangerous, I will yell... Flies! OK. Flies! Oops... Zen? Did you understand any of that? You're supposed to duck. Flies! OK Zen, for real now, OK? mom!! What are you doing? mom, you know she's not normal like the other kids. Why do you have her risk doing stuff like that? Come on, it's good practice for her. This way she can protect herself when she needs it. And we want to make money... I know you mean well, but it's not much money. Well, it's enough to pay your doctor's bills. The medicine you want can have strong side effects and they can be pretty bad. I know. But, you may be lucky with minimal side effects. Why don't you head on home now? Let's go out Hmmm... Zen, mom will call tomorrow. Let's go out! Brush your teeth after you snack too, OK? OK? OK. Let's go out! Let's go... HO!!! Catch the ball... It's for Zen... Do you want to try? Do it for Zen, Come, give it a try, Thank you, thank you, thank you... Thank you, very grateful... Thank you, thank you... mom, why is mom not coming with us? Because we don't have enough money. We need lots of money to pay for medicine for auntie We need lots of money to pay for medicine for auntie so when she's well, she can be with us. so when she's well, she can be with us. Why lots of money? Zen! Look at this! Looks like a lot of people owe money to auntie Zin. Oh, Zen, I'm so sorry, I forgot to tell you that we cannot go out today. But today is the day to go out. I know. Today is the day to go out. Go out today! Go out today! Zen... Today! Today! Sorry... sorry... Today! Today! Today! Zen! Don't be afraid of your mother! Zen! Please stop!

Hang on... she's sick! Listen to me! She needs money for a doctor! Hey... Ouch!! What a cold hearted fool. How does auntie Zin know these people? Bunch of criminals.

If he pays us back, we can pay for all the medicine. Excuse me... What? Who are you here to see? We are here on behalf of Zin, to collect money you owe her. Zin? Oh! I forgot, how much do I owe her?

Oh, by the way, somebody left this candy for your sister. The person was just here. Who was it? I don't remember. Here, someone left you a treat. mom, can you come here? What did you guys do? Why are you covered in bruises? Where did you get all the money? Uhhhmmm... How did this get here? What did you do? Nothing, I went to the hospital. I asked, who did you go to see? Nothing, I went to the hospital and... And what?!? Listen to me auntie! What's your excuse? I asked you to take care of Zen, but what did you end up doing? I asked you to take care of Zen, but what did you end up doing? What do you want me to do? I found your book with all the names of people who owe you money. It's all your money, isn't it? However, I didn't know the full story. We don't have enough money to pay for your medicine. It is so expensive. You're dying, and Zen is mentally handicapped. We need the money! What else are we to do? Who did you go and see? The people in the book. What's going on? Who are they? Did you have trouble with them? We need this money, it could save your life. mom, can you do me a favour? Can you take a letter to Nishi San restaurant. Tell him it's extremely important. Thanks. Sorry to trouble you. I'll try to reach him. If I can reach him, I'll call you. Hang on! Zin is trying to send this letter to her husband. What should we do this time? Just send it. We can then settle this once and for all. It looks like he may return to Thailand. I need to return to Thailand immediately. Hello? Yes... I understand. I'll be there immediately. See you there. Hello? I thought you said they were next door. I haven't seen a single soul! More silent than a cemetery. Wait for me there. OK, I'll be here. Just hurry. Oh... this is ruining my mood... Can you change the channel? I don't like it. Ah... They already left before I got here. They're not here but they should still be alive. Ah... But the gang was here waiting for them. I'll try the store. Ah... I will go... It's me, remember? You know there's no escape. I am not afraid to kill him. Brother mom, where are you? Let's catch up. It's been a long time. We miss you here. Haven't seen you in a while. You look horrible. Give me back my brother. I want to go home. Wouldn't that be nice. If he cared for your kid at all, she wouldn't be going around robbing people. It's my money. It's our money. It's our business. It was our agreement. Nothing was ever yours. That all ended already. But it's not finished with me. Your kid went around beating up my guys. My people were killed by your husband. Then let's end it all here today. mom... Where's mom? So you really want to see him? I can arrange that. mom! mom! If you hadn't gone with that Japanese, you wouldn't have ended up like this. How I'll have to kill you. Zen! Come here! Zen! You bastard! This is between us now. Just you and me. Great great! Come on!! Zen! mom!! Mother... Stop it! Let Zen go! Flies! mom!! mom!! mom!! mom... In reality, any life can never be perfect. But I discovered that one thing can make things less imperfect, one thing can bring life close to perfection. one thing can make things less imperfect, one thing can bring life close to perfection. It is love. We must find love. It is love. We must find love.
