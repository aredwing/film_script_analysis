Give me the keys. How bad is it? I can make it. I only got one more day. I can make it. Please. Let me see it. I went straight through, thank God. -You got lucky. -This is lucky? Yep, darling, this is lucky. It's okay, baby. You may want to bite something. Do you know what you're doing? Spent three years in the desert, darling. I need you to hold still. All right? Your plates are swapped. You're good until Alabama. If you get woozy, you take a bump. Not a line, a bump. Go straight down this road and keep your lights off. You keep 'em fucking off until you hit the pavement. -You understand me? -Thank you so much. THE NEIGHBOR What's he doing? He's shooting rabbits. What's he doing that for? 'Cause they're like squirrels, chewing and digging everything up. Or maybe this is what people do around here. What, is he like a tweaker or something? No, he's not a tweaker. How do you know? His aim's too good. Seriously? You're such a jerk. I'm late, babe. Johnny, when are you coming back? I don't know. It... it shouldn't take too long. A few hours. I can stop and get lunch if you want. No. What is it, then? Nothing. This is temporary. How temporary? A few more deliveries and we're cool. I get straight with my uncle, and then we can get oceanside, you know? Someplace nobody can find us. We're close, babe. We're really, really close. You come in late, you come in short, and you've brought me a side of attitude. I've been sticking my fucking neck out for you. I get it. You know, I read that, the number one reason people give for office theft... is "the company owes me something." You see that employee right there? My nephew. He knows how to do his job. He keeps it clean. And he knows that I don't owe nobody jack shit. That's why he's gonna grow old and fat. And you, I don't know about you. Guille, get this jackass outta here before I lose my temper. Sorry to keep ya. Training day. -Big delivery today, John. -Yeah? What should I expect? 100. Not a penny less. -Light me a goddamn cigarette. Go on, Guille. How's things out at the ranch? Rosie's complaining about the bugs a little bit, but other than that, everything's good. You're doing pretty good for yourself? No problems, right? So if, anything was bothering you, you'd tell me, right? I mean, yeah, of course. Of course I would. Everything's good. You... your daddy was like you. The devil keep his soul. He didn't say much, but when he did, He-he saved my neck more times than I can even think about. I owed him, you see? And that's why I took you in, taught you how to be a man, you know? I mean, you said you wanted to go in the Service. I allowed it. Yeah. But that's over now, John, you know? You've done your time. You at home now with family, right? Where you belong, no? I know, Neil. -Uncle Neil. -Uncle Neil. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a problem, Officer? Step out of the vehicle. Have an appointment today, Johnny? Make a little pickup from your uncle? -I'm clean. -Bullshit. You was born dirty. You know better than to leave it out in the open. Maybe you're hiding it someplace else. Someplace I gotta look a little harder to find. You think I don't know what goes on here, Johnny? Your kind rots this town from the inside out. And I don't take no shit from two-bit dirt rats like you. No matter what your tats say, you'll always be scum under my boots. What you say to me? I just said you're not wrong. you're clean. Guess you weren't lying. Drive safe, Johnny. What happened to you? It ain't mine. How's that gal of yours? She's sick. Is she inside? Nope. Well, I hope she's all right. See ya in a few days. -Hey, what happened? -All good. -There was a good amount. -How much? I think it was like 100 grand or something. 100 grand? How much of that do we get? Tomorrow, the white bag goes to Neil, and we get the fuck outta here. I knew you could do it. I knew you could do it. I knew we could do it. What if we took all of it? Neil would hunt us down and kill us. Is he gonna kill us if we leave? Well, not fucking him over would certainly help him cope. We could really use the whole 100. Yeah, we could, right? It'd certainly make a difference. That would be greedy. Greed makes people unlucky. Yeah? Hey, neighbor. Hey, listen, I hate to bother you so late, but, got a question for you. All right. Brought over a couple cold ones. Yeah, come on in. -All right, cool, thanks. -Have a seat over there. Thank you. -What's he want? -I don't know. -So, what's going on? -I appreciate it. Yeah. By any chance, were you on my land today? Yeah. Yeah, your trashcan was laying in the middle of the road. Just drug it back up to your house. All right. Makes me feel better. Found some tracks, you know, I didn't know if someone was trying to rob me or whatever. Hell, you can't tell about people in these parts. Nope, that was just me. You gonna keep peekin' around that corner or you gonna come out? -Good to meet you. -How you doin'? I'm Rosie. We don't get too many women good-looking as you around these parts. Y'all married? Yeah. All right. Just wondering who you was. I'm Rosie. Night, baby. Yeah, I got me one of those. Yeah, they're pretty good for looking at the stars. I use mine for looking at my neighbors. I'm just screwing with you, John boy, come on. No, but I do watch that road out front. See some pretty interesting things. Sometimes a car will come in light with one pair of plates. Hour later, goes out heavy with another pair of plates. Ain't that weird? We all got our secrets. I ain't no hypocrite. You do what you do, I do what I do. That's why we live out in these parts. Don't want to be bothered by others. Well, I better be headin' on back. My boys gonna be gettin' home at any second. Hey, come on by sometime. I owe you for a cold one. Nighty night, neighbor. Stop being nosey, babe. And pack your bags, we gotta go as soon as I get back, all right? Are you sure you're ready for this? Yeah. Yeah? Leaving everyone? Friends and family and everyone? We don't have any friends. This... I'll see ya, babe. Should just buy everything new. -Hey, any bumps on the road? -Nope. All good. All right. Here you go. Try this. I'm not that hungry... I didn't ask you if you were hungry. -Where you going, John? -I'm not going anywhere. -What the fuck are you talking about? -This is a small town, boy. There's no secrets I don't hear. I don't know what you're listening to, but it's bullshit. -Bullshit? -Why would I fuck you over? You're the only family I got. You are right for Hallmark, boy. I hear everything. Everything. Sometimes I hear things I don't like. Now, I rely on a lot of people. Most especially you. I can't afford for there to be any dissension. You understand? Even if we are family... Come on, come on, come on, come on! Pick up the phone! At the tone, please record your message. When you finish recording, you may hang up... Rosie? Troy! You didn't happen to see, Rosie come by here in last hour or so, did you? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did. Caused quite a dust storm. Seemed she was in a big old hurry to get somewhere. Yeah, see that? That's why I don't mess with 'em. What's that? Pretty girls. Will break your heart every time. Troy? Got those beers. You motherfucker. # Everybody loves, everybody loves # # Everybody making love... # # Everybody making love # # Everybody making love # # Everybody making love # # Everybody... # Fuck. Hey. Kid, you better get up. Fuck. -You're not one of them? -I'm not one of them. -You have to help me get out. -I'm gonna help you. Your last name, what's your name? -I'm Sarah. -Sarah? -Please. -They're not gonna hurt you. They took my friend Cole. You have to help me find him. I know, I know. I just saw him next door. No, that's not him. You have to find him. You have to help him. -Please. -I'm going to. I just need you to stay quiet, all right? People don't make it out of here. -Girl, you gotta be quiet, all right? -Okay. I'll be back. Shit! John! Holy shit. John, he's fucking crazy. -John... -Slow down. -Help me, John, help me. -Slow it down, slow it down, slow down. John, help me. Get me out of here, please! Please. This lock, babe, I need bolt cutters. No, no, you don't. No, just break it off! Just break it the fuck off! -Get me out of here, John, please! -Stop! Fuck. -Fuck. -It's him. It's him. He's back. Fuck. He's back. Fuck. John... I can take him. I'll stop this. I can take him. -Okay. -He doesn't know that I'm here. -He's by himself. -John... -One blow and he's done. -Johnny... -I'll be back before you know it. -Okay. John... side of the road.

Hey, hey! Why you... Why you messing with me? Get off of me. Come on, man! About damn time. Well, which one of you dumbshits forgot how to tie a slipknot? It's nice to see you, too, Daddy. -You got any aspirin? -Aspirin? I'm the one who needs aspirin. I had that kid's dad on the hook for 50K. Now we ain't got shit. Well, you know, you didn't have to kill him. -He saw my face. -What'd you expect me to do? I'm sorry, okay? What do you want from me? You're gonna dig the damn hole. Alone. Hell, like I've never dug a goddamn hole before. Cooper, you all right? Yeah. Just allergies. It's not allergies. Harley, give us a sec, would you? God damn it. Cooper... it's okay to be scared. When your mom died, I was scared. I didn't know how we was gonna survive. But we made it work, didn't we? We found a way. Now, can it get ugly? Yeah. Did we ever mean to hurt these people? No. Hell no. We was just tryin' to get a few bucks from people who already got plenty. And then we was gonna give 'em back. You gotta know that, boy. Today, something went wrong. We just doing our best to make it right and move on. Tonight, I'm gonna need you to do everything I tell you, no matter what happens. Because tonight, we are gonna get everything we need to survive. And then we ain't gonna be scared no more. You go get your brother and go downstairs and I'll show you, okay? -Okay. -I love you, son. All right, boys, we got something special tonight. That little girl's dad is in real estate development. He's worth about five mill. But the mom, she's loaded. I figure her inheritance is worth about 35. Which means little blondie in there oughta fetch about high six figures. Boys, we do this right, we are set. Well, hell, let's just ask for seven. No, no. We play by the rules just enough till they know we're serious, but not too much that they're gonna go call the cops. All right? Let's get to work. -Which one's yours, bud? -Don't matter, either one. Well, it kinda does matter. I don't want your fucking sickness. Allergies, asshole. All right, Cooper. Now, listen to me. When you pick up this hammer, you pick it up real, real slow. It's not about what you're gonna do with it. It's what they think you're gonna do with it. -Yes, Dad. -All right. Let the camera do the rest of it. All right, let's go get her. Please stop. Please don't hurt me. P... please don't... Please. No. This is your proof of life. As you can see, your daughter has not been harmed. Yet... If you do not do as you're instructed... you will never see her alive again. Hey. You did good, boy. You did real good. We done? Don't it look like it? What about the other girl? She ain't worth nothin'. We're gonna have to get rid of her. Why not just ransom her back to that guy? She's seen too much, son. Just ask John. Hell, he's some lowlife trafficker. Can't pay if you don't need the problems. Right? We're just taking out the trash. Doing the world a favor. What we gotta do is keep our eye on that prize. Okay? All right, attaboy. -God, John. -It's all right. You've gotta keep quiet. There's three now. -Okay. -There's three people here. I saw the other kids in the rooms. -I'm going back to our house. -God. I'm gonna get the bolt cutters and I'm gonna get my gun. -This is gonna get really bad... -Okay. -really quickly. -Yeah. -I'm not gonna let them hurt you. -Okay. -I'm not gonna let them hurt you. -Yeah. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Please don't. Dad, help! Dad! Dad! Help! Eat that shit! Fucker! Where's the fucking gun? Fuck. Fuck. Hey, where the hell is your brother? You know Cooper. Goddamn shame we can't keep her, Dad. Yeah, she's a pretty little thing, ain't she? Yeah. Now, remember, you said I have dibs. You do. Do me a favor, though. Don't tear her up too bad. I'm thinking I might like a poke at this little one. Bet you'd enjoy that, wouldn't you, princess? Sweet. Dress her up. Something nice. Don't mind him. No! No! Please! Shut the fuck up! I'm here to help you. I found your friend Sarah, and I've got a girl upstairs, okay? -I need your help. -I'm sorry, I can't walk or run. I tried to run. I'm sorry. I can't walk. No, wait! Where are you going?! -No, don't leave me! -Shut up. I'm gonna cut this chain. I do not want you to move. I am not gonna leave you. Please tell me that you can move on your own. -Yeah, I'm okay, I can move. -Yeah? All right, listen. I found your friend. He's down the hall. He's hurt pretty badly and he can't move on his own. I need you to dial in right now. Do you understand me? My girl is upstairs and I need your help. -Can I count on you? -Yes. -Can you throw? -Yeah. Take this. I want you to throw the rock at that house. And hit it hard. They're gonna come out. So as soon as you throw that, you take him, you go to my truck right over there, start it up, but do not turn the lights on, all right? -You wait for me there. -Okay. All right, listen, do not lose those keys. Count to 100, then throw the rock. Now, I got this off an Iowa girl. They paid a lot of money to get her back. You can tell how much money folks got when they get the girl something like this. You know, little girls generally don't make it on the good wall. No, ma'am. Generally, they're too strung out. Too easy to get. But you are a special little bird. Unique. Prettiest goddamn girl I've ever seen. You're gonna do just right by us. Please... I was beginning to think you didn't speak. You wanna look nice and pretty for your close-up, don't you? Don't you? Zip it up. Something's going on. Cooper! Coop! Cooper! Come on. Cooper! Cooper! -Cooper! -Coop! Dad! He's fucking dead! -I will not leave! -Come on! -Go! Get up! -Keys. Come on. -Shit! Shit! -Get in the truck! Start the fucking truck! Shit! Hold on. -Where you going, John? -It's not what you think. -They got guns. -What? They're coming with guns! Here. Get in the car! Get in the car! Guille! -Guille! -He's dead. Go! Get in the car! -My God! -Get in the car! Come on! Go, go, go, go! -Are you all right? -Yeah. Go, go, go! Keep your heads down. Heads down! Ain't nobody gonna take me! Come on, motherfuckers! Shit! John, I'm gonna need you... -Fuck! -Don't fucking move! -John! -Rosie! # Take my heart # # Precious love # # Guide my hand... # That motherfucker! Fuck! Fucker! I knew you were trouble, Johnny. The Service puts a certain moral code in you. Just like it puts a certain moral code in me. You know, I just wanted to kill you. This is ugly country. People do ugly things. Ain't it like that sometimes? Get the fuck up! You understand what it means to take a life. They don't understand what it means to give it. Fuck you! God damn it! This is old country, Johnny. No place for weakness. Motherfuckers. Cooper didn't do shit to you. You fucking murderers! Takes someone like me to see that. To see that some people ain't even meant to be born in the first place. # Woe to those # # Who embark # # Then to take us apart # # I call upon # # The Lord # # Whom I serve... # Fuck.
