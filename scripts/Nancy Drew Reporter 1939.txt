When you find Mr. Tracy, would you ask him if he'd condescend... ...to undertake a reportorial chore for me this afternoon? If you don't mind. Oh, no, sir. I don't mind. Don't stand there like an imbecile. Round him up. Yes, sir. - Well, they're here, Mr. Bostwick. - Who's here? - The students. - What are they doing here? Mr. Bostwick, don't you remember? It was a promotion tie... up to increase circulation. And what did I promise them? Well, they were to work for you for three days as real reporters. And the one who submits the best story during that time... ...was to receive $50. - And a gold medal. - Oh, I might have guessed it. I don't know why I let you talk me into these things. You had the place filled with a lot of champion potato pickers. Now, the place will be over... crowded with a lot of crazy cubs. - I won't see them. - Mr. Bostwick, they're right beside you. Mr. Bostwick, these are the young people... ...you've been so anxious to meet. Nancy Drew from the Brinwood School for Young Ladies. - I'm very pleased to meet you. - How are you? Miss Phyllis Kimble of... - How are you? - How do you do? Are we really going to have real assignments just like real reporters? - I know all about fashions. - I'm dying to find out. Can I cover a scandal? Girls, boys. Mr. Bostwick, won't you say a few words to the contestants? Yeah. Very few. Why anyone is simple... minded enough to want to work on a newspaper... ...Ive never been able to find out. Why, Mr. Bostwick. Journalism is a very noble and glorious career. With the adventure, romance and everything, I should think you'd love it. I do love it, I love every minute of it. I love my employees too. Here, take one. All right. I won't look. What did you get? I've gotta write a story about a squirrel in the park. - Where's the mayor live? - Why? I gotta find out how many babies he kissed. "A human... interest story about a goldfish"? "Ladies' Amateur Poetry Club, Cozy Nook Tea Room, 1 p.m." - All right, now. Come on. Get going. - All right, children. Come on. And if it isn't news, you needn't bother coming back. - Clever idea? - We'll go into that later. Mr. Bostwick, I don't believe you take us seriously. My dear Miss Whoosis, in regard to your supposition... ...I see you're not without perspicacity. I still haven't been able to find Mr. Tracy. Every time I depend upon a reporter, I'm double... crossed. Oh, all right, leave a memo on his desk. Tell him to hurry over to the courthouse. They're holding an inquest on that woman. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Imbecile school children. Are you satisfied with your assignment, Miss Drew? Oh, I think it will do, for a start. Dr. Carey, please. Raise your right hand. Do you swear the testimony you give... ...will be nothing but the truth? - I do. Dr. Carey, as autopsy surgeon, you examined the body of Kate Lambert? - I did. - And what did you find? That Miss Lambert's death was not caused by heart failure... ...as Dr. Hibbard certified. Her death was caused by a poison. Sodium ferranide. What is sodium ferranide? It's a chemical used in photography. Is such a chemical easily obtained? Oh, no. Only on special order from the manufacturer. It's a new agent not yet on the open market. In fact, only those who are well advanced in photography know about it. Miles Lambert. Mr. Lambert, you're the first to suspect your aunt had not met a natural death? I was. What aroused your suspicions? For years, Dr. Hibbard had assured me... ...that my aunt's heart condition was nothing to worry about. And when she died so suddenly, I was naturally very shocked and surprised. But even so, I didn't suspect anything... ...until I happened to run across a scientific magazine in my aunt's library. There was an article, which had a great deal of significance to me... ...in view of the circumstances. The article was about sodium ferranide... ...and the portions of it dealing with the chemical's poisonous properties... ...had been carefully marked in pencil. To whom does this magazine belong? It's addressed to Eula Denning. - Did you mark this article, Miss Denning? - Well, I... - I must have - Why? I keep a file of all chemicals I work with. Especially poisonous ones and their antidotes. Then you are interested in photography? Yes. How familiar are you with sodium ferranide? Well, I know something about it. Miss Denning, what was your relationship to Kate Lambert? My mother was her companion for many years. After mother died, Miss Lambert took care of me. Isn't it true that in Miss Lambert's will, you were the sole beneficiary? Yes. But I didn't kill her. Why, Kate Lambert was the best friend I ever had. She put me through school, treated me as her own child. Yet you coerced her into making a will leaving all her property to you. - No. - A will that was made... ...less than a week before her death. - No. I didn't do it. Someone must have taken the poison from the dark room. Mr. Garrett, if you had the chemical tin, that would prove I was innocent. How? The murderer's fingerprints would be on it. - Not if they'd been removed. - But they couldn't be removed. If anyone touched that chemical... ...the ferranide would etch the prints into the metal. A search has been made for the poison container. - It's missing. - But it must be in the house. You were the only person connected with the Lambert household... ...with a knowledge of sodium ferranide. You were the only one who had access to her room the night she died. And the only one who had motive to commit murder. I didn't kill her, I tell you. I didn't. I didn't kill her, I tell you. That's all. - What's the verdict? - The girl's being held for trial. Murder. What's up, baby? Something we didn't figure on. I gotta get out to the Lambert joint and find a tin can. - Look out. - Oh, heavens. Come back here. He's gone away. He drove away. Knocked the bumper off. What's all this about a tin can? There's fingerprints on it. If the cops find it first, we're gonna be in a jam. - A jam? How? - Never mind how. If Eula Denning isn't set up, she'll get all that old lady's dough. Oh, I see. And if she is set up, the money goes to Miles Lambert. Not bad. - How much do you get? - Oh, Lambert will take care of me. I'll have to start being nice to Mr. Lambert. Don't you be nice to nobody but me, lamby pie. Be careful, baby. Officer, did a man come in here? The DA's closed up this joint. No one can get in here without a court order. I'm here to see to that. Well, the man bumped into my fender and ran away and... Oh, a hit and runner? Yes. And he must be around here some place. - It's the only place he could've gone. - You and I will just take a look around. Maybe you'd better go on that side, I'll go on this one, so he can't escape. Good idea. And if you spot him, yell. I'll come a running. Hey, what are you doing there? Why, I'm here to read the gas meter. That's the man, officer. He's the one who smashed my fender. - Oh, a run and hitter? - Yes. I won't prefer charges if you pay to have it fixed. Well? Will this square it? Itll only cost me three and a half to have my fender fixed... ...and about 50 for the gasoline I wasted, so here's a dollar back. All right, get along with you? Thanks a lot, officer. He had an awful lot of money for a gas meter reader. Maybe I'm in the wrong branch of the service. Did he say he was from the gas company? Yes. Gee, that's kind of funny. I got it, Mr. Bostwick. All about the Lambert inquest. I was delayed on account of a man ran into my fender. So it was you? You switched those assignment slips, didn't you? Well, I thought reporters always did things like that. At least, they do in the movies. It says right in my textbook... ...that a newspaperman must stop at nothing to get news. If she intends to impress the editor she must do much more... ...than what the assignment calls for. So there. A thing like this would happen to me. I have it. Every word. Oh, it's sensational. I'll bet you, you never thought I could do it. The story of the Lambert inquest was on the street a half hour ago. But that's impossible. I had it right here in... We were lucky enough to get it from the DA's office. Oh, dear. And I was so sure I had a scoop and you'd have to stop the presses. - Stop the presses? - Or something. My dear little girly, will you please take pity on a poor, tired old man? If another thing like this happens to me today, I'll lose my mind. - Good morning, Dad. - Good morning, pet. How's the star reporter this morning? Don't mention it. You watch. I'll show that Mr. Bostitch whatever his name is. - I'll get a story yet. - That's the spirit. - Good morning, Miss Nancy. - Good morning, Effie. Doesn't that look good? Effie, you're an artist. Boy, oh, boy. What cuisine. Oh, shucks, Miss Nancy. That's just plain old cereal. Dad, I have a favor I wanna ask of you. Go right ahead, darling. I'm in a receptive mood this morning. Go right ahead. Well, Eula Denning needs a good lawyer and I want you to defend her. No, I wouldn't want that case, Nancy. I've been reading, I'm afraid the girl is guilty. There's no extenuating evidence. I'll bet she didn't do it. What makes you think that? I don't know. I guess maybe it's my woman's intuition. She doesn't look the type who'd poison anybody. You can't go by type. The most charming woman in history was a murderess. Committed crimes less than the Lambert estate. That's where the man with the funny ear came in. Funny ear? What are you talking about? This man sat next to me during the inquest. And afterwards got in a car and ran into my fender. I'm gonna take that car away if you start having accidents. But it wasn't my fault. I wasn't even in the car. That's why I followed him. I made him pay for that fender too. Guess what? He went to that estate and tried to get in. - Probably another reporter. - I don't think so. He didn't look smart, and he acted suspicious. I wouldn't concern myself about it. - Oh, no. - You want it? Certainly. I'm saving it for last. - Goodbye, darling. - Bye... bye, Dad. Ted. Oh, Ted. - Where are you, Ted? - In the garage. What do you want? Come here, will you? It's something very important. Oh, I'm busy. Well, where are you? Here. What's the matter? What are you hiding for? Somebody tried to blow up my car. Oh, stop it, will you? It's nothing to get excited over. Nothing to get excited over? How can you say a thing like that? Why, I might have been blown to bits right before my very eyes. It's just a gag. A whistle bomb. - You mean, it's just a practical joke? - Sure. It blows off when you press the starter. And boy did you go into a tailspin. I'll bet you put that thing there. Oh, don't be an infant. I got better things to do. Well, fine thing. It's practically a menace to civilization. Anyone who'd do a trick like that ought... Pipe down. Pipe down. - We didn't do anything. - Hey, let me go. I'm gonna tell Ma on you. - They got a load of them. - Not mine, they're Killer's. Killer Parkins, you'll grow up to be a fiend. - Lt was Mary's idea. - Lt certainly was. Mary Nickerson, you ought to be ashamed of... Ted, aren't you going to speak to your sister? That gangster? She's out of my control. You're jealous because you didn't think of it first. - Give me those. - These belong to my big brother. They don't, now. Now, go on. Get out of here. Before I lose control of myself. Go on. Get out of here. You thugs. I'm in my own back yard and don't you dare come in. Nice going, Nancy. The very idea. Just a nice quiet morning at the Drews. - Well, so long, I'll be seeing you. - Where you going? Where do you think I'd be going with tennis racket, to shovel coal? I'll tell you where he's going for 10. I wouldn't pay you a penny, I'm not interested. Then what are you asking for? You get in the house. I'll tell you anyway. He's got a date with a beautiful girl. Are you going to play tennis again with that woman? What do you mean, woman? She is only two years older than you are. Well, if you'd rather play tennis, why all right. But I was sort of depending on you to help me. Of course, my getting the best story for the paper isn't important. You know how it is. The honor would be nice. - Gosh, Nancy. - It's all right. Go right ahead. Don't mind me. I just... Oh, by the way, I have something for you. Oh, you have? Well, what is it? It's nothing really. Just a little birthday present. I spent the four bucks I had to fix the fender. Well, gee, Nancy, thanks. But my birthday isn't for two months yet. Is that so? Oh, well. Now that you've seen it, you might as well keep it. Well, gee, thanks. I don't... Oh, gosh. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Wait a minute, Nancy. Look, I might postpone my tennis date if you really need me. Don't bother. Don't bother. I was going down to the jail to interview Eula Denning... ...I wanted you to take your camera along. So far, she hasn't allowed anyone to take her picture. Then how do you expect me to get one? Oh, I'd think of a way. Then you don't really need me? Well, reporters always take staff photographers... ...when they're on important assignments and besides... ...Dad doesn't like my going into the jail alone. I'll go with you. A jail is no place for children, Mary. Let her go. Maybe they'll lock her up. I should say not. Now, go on, change your clothes. Wear your new hat. - All right. - I'll get your camera for you, Ted. Hurry. I want to make the noon edition. And besides, maybe you'll have time to fix my fender. Duped again. - No cameras. - Well, you see, I... Give the lady your camera, Ted. Well, okay. All right. Over there. That's that. You should have known you couldn't get a camera in. I did. What was in the case? I took out the camera and put in a block of wood. I figured something like this. Look, you don't expect me to take a picture in here after what she said? Of course, silly. And if they catch us we'll stay here. Oh, stop your worrying. Put your hat on. - Inside? - Of course. You never saw a real newspaperman without his hat on, did you? They even eat in them. No, not like that. It looks awful. For gosh sakes, what're you doing? - You just gave it to me. - I know. No, now let me fix it. Fix it is right. Oh, you ruined it. There. Now you look like a real reporter and not a store window dummy. Yes? I'm Nancy Drew of the Tribune, and Mr. Nickerson, my photographer. - Hello. - Oh, a reporter. You seem so young. I guess, I better explain. We're not real reporters. I want to win a prize in journalism and that's why I wanted an interview. - What did you say your name was? - Nancy Drew. Are you related to Carson Drew, the attorney? He's her father. Oh, I see. Miss Denning, do you know a man with a funny ear? It's all sorts folded up like. No, I don't. Why do you ask? There was one at the inquest. I was wondering if he's a friend of yours. I don't know who it could be. Miss Denning, I don't think you did anything. That is, I mean, I think you're innocent. If it's all right, I'm gonna ask my father to come. Oh, if he only would. You see, there's... Well, there're so much evidence against me. Why, it's even worst now than it was yesterday. Did they find something else? Police checked with manufacturers and learned... ...the only sale of sodium ferranide in this part of the country was to me. Well, if you only had that tin can, the one the poison came in. You know, you told about it at the inquest yesterday. - It's disappeared. - Someone probably stole it. I saw it just the other day when I was cleaning... out the darkroom. I can't understand why they didn't find it. - Lt was... - What's the matter? The tin was empty, but I didn't throw it away. I wanted to save it because the manufacturer's address was on it. Think hard. Maybe you can remember what you did with it. I put some empty bottles and things in the basement in an old cupboard. The container must've been with them. - Maybe it's still there. - Yeah. You just leave it to me, and please don't tell anyone. Oh, I almost forgot. Miss Denning, may we take a picture of you? - I don't mind. - Hurry up, Ted. Thanks a lot, Miss Denning, and we'll let you know what happens. - A bit to your right. - Look sad now. Hold it. Here, what's the big idea? What's going on out here? We're taking the quaddle form to porknip with the ornflarble. Am... skray. - Ls the gentleman with the prisoner? - Ted, I think we better be leaving. What if you can get in? It's still illegal. Not for a reporter. Reporter has the right to do things an ordinary person shouldn't. Now go ahead and do exactly as I told you. Okay. But if anything happens, don't blame me. - Hello. - Well? You don't wanna subscribe to any magazines, do you? - No. - I didn't think you did. - Are you watching this place? - Yep. Well, I guess you get kind of lonesome around here all by yourself? Sometimes. I'm not very busy right now. If you like, I could play a little game of rummy or something. Say, that's an idea, son. - Draw up a chair. - Swell. Look, do you mind if I sit over there? I'm kind of superstitious. Oh, sure, sure. We ought to have something to shoot at, son. - Say, a penny a point? - A penny a... Yeah, that'll be fine. I'll keep score for you. Hurry, Nancy Hurry opkay's getting my oughday Hey Don't do that. It puts me off of my game. Oh, I'm sorry. What was that noise? What noise? - I'd better investigate. - Well, you were just hearing things. Maybe so. Ted. Your mother wants you to come home right away. Oh, hello. Glad to see you again. Well, I guess I'll have to be going. - How do we stand? - I'll figure it up. You got me in a fine mess. I lost my allowance to that rummy shark. Well, it was worth it. I found the tin can. Yeah? That man with the funny ear was there. He chased me out of the basement. Gosh, Nancy, we took an awful chance. Maybe we shouldn't have done it. We better get this to the police station. See if Captain Tweedy can find fingerprints on it. Suffering cats. Look at the time. My tennis date was at 3. But this is more important than tennis. - She will never play with me again. - Don't you want to go? You don't need me. You can tell me about it later. Goodbye. Help. Help. Stop that woman. She's thief. Look out. She's a thief. Stop her, please. Thief. Stop her. Stop her. She's a thief. Captain Tweedy, of all people, it would have to be you. Well, what are you staring at? Come on, get away. Break it up. - Hi, Dad. - Hello, pet. - Gee, I'm glad you're home. - You are? What are you doing up so late? You get back to sleep. Good night. - Oh, but Dad. I can't go to sleep. - What's the matter? Nothing. No? Come on in, tell me all about it. Now? Dad you've always taught me to do right, haven't you? I tried to, Nancy. Dad, if I believed in something I knew was right... ...I should always live up to it. More than that. Don't back down an inch. Supposing you made a promise that you knew was right... ...I bet you you'd keep it. - Certainly. A person who fails to live up to his promise is a weakling. You'd never want me to break a promise, would you? Of course not, Nancy. If you make a promise in good faith... ...Id expect you to live up to it, no matter what it cost you. And you'd help me live up to it? Certainly. What kind of a father do you think I am? Then, you're going to defend Eula Denning... ...because I promised her you would. What? You said you'd help me keep a promise. Nancy, you tricked me into this. You're always doing that to me. Now, I won't have... Well, all right. If you can give me any reason to believe that Eula Denning is innocent... ...Ill take her case. Oh, Dad, I knew you would. Well, Ted and I went out to that Lambert house this afternoon. I found that tin of sodium ferranide. The one that could've had fingerprints on it. You two went out there alone? I know it was important evidence. That man with the funny ear chased me out of the basement. And Dad, that's not the worst of it. When I was taking that tin to the police, a woman stole it from me. That proves other people are mixed up in it. - You should have gone to the police. - Oh, I know it. Everything's gone wrong. I failed all around. - Maybe I'm just not intelligent. - That's right. - Dad. - Darling, everybody makes mistakes. Don't you see, Dad? If Miss Denning is convicted, it'll be my fault. I was foolish and lost the evidence that could save her. - I'm responsible. - Well, don't worry, Nancy. I'll see Eula Denning in the morning. Oh, Dad, honestly, I feel 10 years younger. Don't be too enthusiastic. There isn't a stick of evidence we could take into court. There will be if you can get hold of that man. - Would you know him if you saw him? - With that ear? I'll say. It looked like one of Effie's popovers. - A cauliflower ear? - What? - I said a cauliflower ear. - What did you say? I can't understand you, Nancy. Well, how can you expect to splashing around like a seal after a fish. - That's no way to talk to your father. - They're stockings. Why don't you take them out? Here's the towel. Oh, dear, Now I have to start all over again. I said that that man's ear looked like one of Effie's popovers. I said, it was probably a cauliflower ear. That might indicate that he was a boxer or a wrestler. Really? What connection such a man could have in this case is more than I can see. I felt all along that that man with the funny ear was a clue. I think you ought to do something about him. I'm going to do something about a girl with a funny face. - Come on baby, you're going to bed. - Put me down. I'm no baby. - You'll always be your daddy's baby. - I won't be anybody's baby. Everybody loves a baby That's why I'm in love with you - Pretty baby, Pretty baby - Oh, Dad. Dad, don't be so silly. Good night baby Good night baby Good night baby I'm going to leave you now Oh, Dad, we've gotta talk this thing over. In the morning, the morning The bright and early morning The morning Hello. - I'm Nancy Drew. - Charmed, I'm sure. Draw up a chair. No, thank you. I've been standing all day. Do you keep pictures of prize fighters and people like that? You should meet some of my wife's folks. You came to the right place. I know them all. What's your guy look like? Oh, you'll know him in a minute. He has a cauliflower ear. Here. If you recognize him, let me know. - Ted. Oh, Ted. - What do you want? Well, don't make me yell. Come here. - Excuse me a second, Helen. - Okay. - How did you find me here? - Hello, Ted. - Oh, I get it. - Where would one expect to find you? - Ted's got a girlfriend. - Ted's got a girlfriend. Quiet, small fry. - She's not so pretty. - I'll bet Ted thinks so. - What's on your mind? - Look at this clipping I found. Hey, let me see. Soxie Anthens. Who's that? He's the man I saw at the Lambert place. He used to be a boxer. He's at Maxie's gymnasium on 1 st Street. - How do you know? - Yeah. How do you know? I just asked myself where I'd go if I were a prize fighter... ...and it would be a gymnasium. I called up all the places in town, pretended I was Mr. Anthen's girlfriend. Pretty soon I found out he was at Maxie's. Then I hung up. Yeah. Well, it was nice of you to tell me about it. I... I gotta get back. - Goodbye, Ted. - Goodbye. I don't want to keep you. I thought I'd let you know where I'll be if Dad asks you. You're not going down to that gym alone? I am. Something has to be done about Soxie right sway. He's important evidence. You tell me about it so I'll get in a jam with your father... ...for letting you go there. I did no such thing. You're not responsible for me. We'll go with you. We just love fights, don't we? - I hope to kiss a polecat. - You two will not go. - Why not? - Never mind. Darn it, Nancy. Now you got me worried. Maybe I better go along. I don't think you ought to. It's a tough place. - I can take care of myself and you too. - Well, if you insist. Here. - What's this? - Your costume. You'll pose as a boxer by the name of One... Round Loogan... ...gain Soxie's confidence. Who knows? Maybe he'll incriminate himself. Say, you had this all figured out, didn't you? Why, Ted Nickerson, I did not. Ten cents. - This is an awful joint. - Ted, there he is. I'm positive the woman that stole the tin can from me is Soxie's girlfriend. Now all you have to do is get him to tell you her name, where she lives. Maybe you'd like to know if she's got any bridge work. How will I...? Remember Captain Tweedy always said, "Cherchez la femme." Find the woman. - The only smart thing he ever did say. - Yeah, and he stole that. It's true. You can always get information from women. They just love to talk. Yeah, I've noticed that. Go ahead now. I'll wait out here for you. - He doesn't look very friendly does he? - Remember, you're One... Round Loogan. - Wait a minute. What's the name? - One... Round Loogan. All right, champ, but don't get sore. Everything's all right. - Hi, champ. - I ain't no champ. You sure train like one. I'm kind of new around this break. But I've been putting the boys on the canvas up in Frisco. - Yeah? - That'll be enough of that. Didn't I see you with a nice... looking dame? - What's your name? - One... Round Loogan. I'll bet that babe... One... Round Loogan. Never heard of you. Well, I ain't very well known around here yet. How about sparring a few rounds? That'll get you attention. Oh, I ain't gonna do any training today. If you're a fighter, you're in training all the time. Well, well, I didn't bring my clothes. That's all right. I'll get you some. Hey, Jake. - Yeah. - Get the guy a pair of trunks. He's gonna show me how they do things out in Frisco. - Oh, sure. Well, come on. - But, I'd really rather not. I want some gum, please. Maxie's gym. This is Soxie Anthens' girlfriend speaking. Will you have him call me back as soon as he can. Wait a minute. He's right here. Hello? Hey, Soxie. Your girlfriend wants you to call her right away. Okay. Come on, in here. No, no, not there. Come on through here. Hey. Get in there, will you? In you go. All right, Soxie, warm up a little bit. A little, that's it. No dames. But I've gotta go in there. I'm his manager. His manager? What...? Ted, what are you doing? Gee, Nancy, I'm in an awful mess. I just learned something that might be an important clue. I wanna go. So do I, but I can't. I gotta fight him. Fight him? Oh, Ted, you mustn't. I'll get mobbed or something if I don't. Oh, dear. Oh, look. Maybe he's out of condition. Yeah, like an ox. Okay, One... Round, let's go. Ready, Jake? All set. Well, goodbye, Nancy. Now folks, we're gonna have a little excitement. Three... round boxing exhibition... ...between Soxie Anthens of Chicago, who we all know... ...and One... Round Loogan, the Frisco Flash. All right, boys, go to your corners and come out fighting. Why, One... Round, your glove is untied. Here, let me fix it for you. Nancy, you're a genius. Now if I can only tag him. Come on, Soxie, come on. Come again, Ted. I mean, Loogan. - Tag him on a whisker, Soxie. - The kid ain't got no whiskers yet. He has too. Wow, chalk one up. Well, chase him for a change. - How much time left? - Come on, Ted. Don't be so nice to him. Attaboy, Ted. Come on, hit again, hit him again. Come on. Come on, Loogan. Come on, hit him. Do something, hit him, hit him. Attaboy, Ted. Now, you got him. Ted. Ted, Ted. Oh, Ted, speak to me. Speak to me. Ted, what happened? That's what I was just about to ask you. Try three, five, two, four, four, nine. Gee, I wonder what they're doing. I don't know, Killer. Maybe they're both insane. Hello, this is Soxie Athens. Is my girlfriend there? No soap. Dear, there's only one more we can call, and that just has do be it. - If you got the rest of them right. - Oh, I'm sure I have. Yeah. Oh, look at me. I'm ruined. I won't even dare show up for my tennis lessons now. Tennis lessons? Ted, is that girl you've been playing with a tennis teacher? Sure. It's Helen Winfield, the champ. Those lessons cost me one... fifty a copy. Tennis teacher. Oh, that's wonderful. I mean, I'm sorry about your lessons, but... Hey, what's the matter with you? Nothing. Nothing. Now try that other number three, five, two, four, four, O. Maybe you ought to be psychoanalyzed. Oh, I'm going home and getting me a cookie. Get me one too. I'm gonna stay here and find out what it's all about. Okay, pal. Room clerk, Beldenburg Hotel. This is Mr. Soxie Anthens. I'm calling my girlfriend. She isn't here just now, Mr. Anthens. - It's the place, how do I get her name? - Be strategic. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know where Miss... went? No I don't, but I'll see if she left a message in your box. - Soxie lives there too. - Really? No, there's no message, Mr. Anthens. Shall I tell her you called? Just a moment. Oh, Joe, did Miss Lucas take your cab? Yeah. Why? - Her name is Lucas. - Yeah. She went to the Mandarin Cafe, Mr. Anthens. Well, thank you ve... Thank you very much. Mandarin Cafe. Have you any money? - Well, not to brag about. - Neither have I. Don't eat too much. Oh, boy, a Chinese place. Mary Nickerson. We just love Chinese places. Don't we? - Yeah. - Where did you hoodlums come from? Thought you'd get away from us, didn't you? Yeah. - You're going home. - We are not. We might get lost. We're going with you. - Over my dead body. - Mine too. Well, I guess I'll just have to call up Nancy's father then. Oh, all right, all right. I suppose we'll have to do it. On one condition, when the waiter takes your order, you say "I'm not hungry." - But I am. How about you, Killer? - I'm starved. We haven't enough money. Are you going to cooperate with us or not? - How about it, Killer? - Sure, we'll play along. Okay, let's go. Wait a minute. Let's just try this once. Now, I'm the waiter. What'll you have, pests? Chop suey. - No. No. - No, No. Look, we're broke. We can't buy you any food. - Would you settle for a glass of milk? - Well, we might go that far. Okay. It's a deal. Ted, why do you have to have a sister? Ask Ma. Oh, I'm afraid this is a little too close to the orchestra. This will be fine. Thank you very much. Ted, did you see? She's right in the next booth... ...with Miles Lambert. - She is? Something's funny. I'm positive that's Soxie's girl. I think she's stepping out with Mr. Lambert. - Do you suppose Soxie knows Lambert? - He might. Let me out. - What for? - Never mind. Never mind that. Come on. Maxie's Gym. Soxie. - Hello. - Mr. Anthens? This is a friend. Would you be interested in knowing... ...that Miss Lucas is dining with Miles Lambert... ...at the Mandarin Cafe? - Who's talking? Who'd you call? I phoned Soxie about Lambert and Miss Lucas. And was he mad. - Suffering cats. - We may learn something important. When he gets here, something's sure to happen. Yeah, probably a tong war. What you order, please? I'll have some egg foo young. - And you? - Just tea. And you too, please? Glass of milk. - And chop suey. - Yes, yes. Ted, look. - Soxie. - You cheap little... - Take it easy, Soxie. - Sit down. You've been planning to run out... ...since you found Lambert was on that lady's dough. Shut up, Soxie. As for you wise guy, you want this dame, she's yours. But the moment you and her try a break, you're gonna get a surprise. I still got the tin can, with fingerprints on it. - I know what to do with it. - Why, you... Soxie, Soxie, don't. Hey, what's the matter? Hey, where you come from? - What you doing? What's the matter? - Why? - I go call the police. - No, no. Don't do that. We don't want any publicity. Come on, dolly. - Get the check. I gotta call Dad. - Sure. - Yes? - Your daughter's on the phone. Thank you. Hello, Nancy. Dad what happens to the Lambert estate if Eula Denning is convicted? It goes to Miss Lambert's nearest relative, Miles Lambert. Why? Oh, I was just wondering. Thanks, Dad. - Come on, Ted, hurry up. - Give me some dough. I'm short. It's all I have. Sixty... five cents more, please. Look mister, that's all we got. Maybe you'll trust us? Oh, sure, sure, you nice people, I trust you. Thank you very much. Come on, Ted, we've got to hurry. Sixty... five cents. But you just said you trust us. You see, we gotta go home and get the money from our folks. But we'll come back. Sixty... five cent. Now, look what you got us into. We don't know nothing about it, do we, Killer? No, they invited us. Look, mister, we haven't got 65 cents. Got check, no 65 cent? - Yeah. That's right. - No. You wash dish all day. Maybe two, three day. Hey, hey, where you go? Kitchen that way. - Kitchen that way. - Now, look. - I don't wanna wash dishes. - I'm awful tired, but I can supervise. You're gonna wash dishes, both of you, and it'll serve you right too. - Hey, mister, maybe she could entertain. - Entertain? - Yeah, she's a famous singer. - I thought you was my pal. - What're you trying to do? - You must be winging. Honest, sir, she's sung all over the world. All right, you sing nice American song. No good, wash dishes. Come on, quick. - What will I sing? - Anything. "Little Bo Peep." - Oh, oh, dear. - We'll be in for life after this. Say, mister, can't you help her out? I can't do it, they're just too fast. Oh, phooey. Oh, Miss Drew, now we are all present. Now, here's the $50 and the medal. And now, if Mr. Bostwick has chosen the best news story... ...submitted by our charming... - Give the prize to this one. About the humane worker who invented a nut cracker... ...for toothless squirrels. That's me. I won. I won. - Lt is with great pleasure... - Unless Miss Drew has a story. Oh, I have a story, Mr. Bostwick, but it's very confidential. You see, my father... Well, what is it? The fact is, Mr. Bostwick, some strange man called my father... ...and said he had the missing tin of sodium ferranide... ...with fingerprints on it that would prove Eula Denning is innocent. And would show up the real murderer of Kate Lambert. - Ls this true? - Why, Mr. Bostwick... ...you know my father's reputation and I wouldn't tell a lie. - Go on. Go on. - Furthermore... ...the man's bringing the tin to my father's office this evening. Terrific. Charlie, stop the presses. You're wonderful, Miss Drew. Hold page one for replate. Hottest story yet. Hey, rewrite. Don't stand there like a half wit, give her the money, she won. - Congratulations. - And now, Miss Drew... ...I take great pleasure in presenting you the check and the medal. Give the check to the others, I'll just take the medal. Come on, Ted. We're in a hurry. Remarkable. - Remarkable. - Isnt it a whopper? "Well, Soxie Anthens gonna spill the beans." Well, well. You don't understand Sergeant Entwhistle, that story isn't true. It's printed in the paper. - Nancy just made it up. - What they print it for, if it isn't true? That's the trouble with newspapers. It wasn't their fault. I made the editor think the story was on the level. Why? Oh, dear, Sergeant Entwhistle, are you sure Captain Tweedy won't be back? Sure, I'm sure. He's in Chicago on a radio interview on how to avoid crime. He's done it, all right. - Just the same, I'll bet he'd understand. - Yeah. What's Captain Tweedy got that I don't? Well, for one thing... Look, sergeant, I put that story in the paper... ...so the police could trap the real murderer. Well, that's different. How? Don't you see? That paper'll be on the street any minute. If Lambert's the murderer... ...he'll go after that tin can the minute he reads the story. He'll think Soxie's gonna double... cross him. Miss Drew, I'm sort of influenced to think you've got something. Of course. All you have to do is be at Soxie's place when Lambert arrives... ...and arrest them with the evidence. - Where does this guy, Soxie, live? - Room 815, Beldenburg Hotel. We'll help you identify them. - You can't come along. - But I got to go along. I want to get an eyewitness story about the case. When they read what I write, you'll be promoted. Yeah? I see what you mean. Promise to keep out of trouble. - Oh, sure, we promise. - We promise. This is Sergeant Entwhistle. Send up a couple of squad cars. - Hey. - Oh, no, no. You mustn't do that. If they see police around, they'll run away. Or at least get rid of that tin. Yes, I see what you mean. I'll go alone, capture them single... handed. That will be much better, but, if they even see you, then... Don't worry. They'll never know me. I'll wear that disguise in the Cullen case. Here it is, sergeant. Thanks. Thank you. - Oh, careful, Grandma's medicine. - Clumsy. - Good evening, young man. - Good evening, madam. Will you register, Arthur? Oh, sure, Grandma. Grandmother would like the same room she had when she was here. - What was it, Grandma? - Let's see. My memory ain't what it used to be. Was it, 815? Well, 815 is occupied, Mrs. Plopper. But I can give you the one right next to it. - Oh, that would be wonderful. - Yes, that will have to do. I have to be up high on the account of my asthma. I see. - Show Mrs. Plopper to 817. - Come children. Why don't they make these doors bigger? - Careful, Arthur. - Yes, Grandma. - Anything else, madam? - No, thanks. There you are. Thank you. Get those bags open. Didn't I tell you about my disguise? - Out here, sergeant. - Okay. Did I fool them. Did I fool them. Anything happens, I'll give you the signal. Right. - Let me do that, will you, Nancy? - Yeah. This one goes to the wall. - Pull that wire through, will you, Nancy? - Sure. - Here. - Okay. I don't like this business, Nancy, it gives me the whim... whams. I know. Me too. All set here. If you don't hear me, let me know. - I can hear him. - Yeah? Why, I'm so sorry. Why, I guess I must be in the wrong room. - What's your name? - Why, my name is Mrs. Plopper. Help. Help. Help. Get the wagon and set it off. Oh, do something. Oh. - Hello. - Drop that phone. We weren't doing anything. Honest. No, we were merely trying... Shut up. Come on, get up, you. All right, get out of here. Come on. Upstairs. All right, hurry it up. Come on. Mister, what are you gonna do to us? All right, in here. I wonder what they did to Sergeant Entwhistle? Gosh, I don't know. - We've gotta get out. - Yeah, I know. - Oh, it's no use, Nancy. - Let's yell. Yeah, together. - Help. Help. - Help. Help. Somebody, help. Think, I hope they got machine guns in this picture. So do I. Say, look. - Nancy's car. - Nancy's car. - Let's let the air out of the tires. - We ought to do something. Say, I just remembered. Hey, those are mine. - Let's put them all on. - Oh, boy. Help, somebody. There's not a chance, Nancy. Not a chance. With hundreds of people right under our feet, there must be some way out. - What's that? - Oh, it's just a fuse box. Say, those are the fuses to the electric sign. If we turned that off, we'd get attention. They wouldn't notice it for hours, maybe. By that time, it'll be too late. Beldenburg. Wait a minute, I've got an idea. - There, that ought to create a sensation. - And this will help. Look. Bed Bud Hotel. Get the engineer to fix it right away. Somebody's coming. Hurry up. Open the door. - Mister, downstairs, a criminal. - We gotta catch it. Follow me. So you were gonna double... cross me. - Get the police, quick. - All right. Give me that. That will hold them. - Ted, hurry up. - Right. You're punchy, Lambert. - That story in the paper was a phony. - Yeah? You're still hanging on to that tin can. In case I have to prove you killed the old dame. I don't trust you. You'll get your dough, soon as they convict Eula. If I double... crossed you, you don't think I'd tie up the law here, do you? - Where did he come from? - He was looking for that tin can. Say this is a frame. Ted, they're getting away. Help. Help. Come on, let's grab this one. They're getting away in my daughter's car. Hey. Hey. Wait. Hey. Hey. After them, man. Nancy, get off that car. Stop you idiot. That's the car I'm chasing. Come on, let's go. Hell, what's this all about? That's the man that poisoned the Lambert woman. - And here's the proof. - Hi, Dad. Nancy, how many times have I told you not... Sergeant, how dare you allow my daughter... Calling car 21, calling car 2... 1. Proceed to Gem Movie Theater. Apprehend two kids, boy and girl, about 13. Didn't like picture. Set off whistle bomb. That is all.
