Stop, please, it hurts. - Does it hurt? - No, it just makes a lot of noise. No. no, don't. Hold on for another minute, baby. No more, please... please, please. It hurts. I want the red crayon! I want the red crayon! I want the red crayon, now, the red crayon, now, now... - What's happening? - Must be the power... What the hell? Sarah? - Sarah?... I'm gonna get you out. - I want the red crayon! now, now... - Release the bed! - The red crayon... I want the red crayon! Red crayon! - Don't fight it, honey! - I want the red crayon! Red crayon! I want the red crayon! The red crayon! - I want the red crayon! I want the red... - Okay... I want the red crayon! I want the red... - Hey, here... here it is. - I want the red... You'll be okay, everything's gonna be okay. Daddy's here. You'll be risking her health, if you take her home now. You think, by just pushing a button we can get her diagnosed? It's a process of elimination... I know it's slow, but we have to go through all processes, for her symptoms... - just to find out what's actually happening. - I just want her to feel better. I don't think there's anybody in the world that can do more, then we've done already. Have you talked to her? Have you listened to what she has to say... or, you just stuck her in that damn machine? Sir, she's just repeating the same thing, over and over again... - I want the red crayon! - Alright. I want the red crayon! - I don't see a red... is pink, ok? - I want a red crayon! - I want a red crayon! - Come on. I want the red crayon! Sir, I'm really sorry, the problems we've had with our equipment lately. I'm sure all this, must have been very exhausting for you. Have you considered taking her to an institution, especially now... I have considered taking her to another hospital. Look, you should think about it, it's a big decision. Sarah is my daughter, all decisions that concern her are big. Here we go. No, no... Try to get some sleep, ok? - It will do you good. - No, no, not again... Sleep tight baby, make sure the bed bugs don't bite. Love you. I really, really wanna go home. Hey... baby, wake up! Come on. Let's get you out of here, let's take you somewhere... where they'll listened to you, alright? I want a red crayon! I want a red... - What're you doing? - I want... Look, don't do anything, you'll regret later. I want the red crayon! Let us keep her here for tonight. I know what's best for my daughter. You have to believe me, if I knew a better place for her... I'd take her there myself. You think you know better than me, because you have meters and meanings. You don't really know, what's going on. Look, she doesn't even wanna leave. Your great machines caught a fire with her inside it! I know that, but she needs to stay. - We're trying a new med on her. - I wanna sleep! I wanna sleep! You get your own bed in a minute, Tobias. If we stop the medication, she could develop a more... serious condition and we'll have to keep her here a lot longer. Not six, not seven, not hell, and not heaven. Everybody alright? Yeah, we're alright, but this elevator sure isn't. Tobias. Tobias? Quit messing around, man. Tobias? Tobias? Call for help! This is Rick, Security, we're stuck in elevator six... we need help now, it's an emergency! Hello? Hello? This is Rick, Security, we're stuck in elevator six... we need help now, it's an emergency, and quick! Hello? Why don't you just let me die? Jesus Christ. Where is everyone? - Is there repairs going on? - No. There should be... there should be patients here. And staff. Shhh... - It's the air-conditioning... - Why? It's off. It's a god-damn fire drill. - Alright, let's take the stairs. - Good. Come on! - It's locked. - Can't you see. Can't you see? Can't you see? I don't wanna listen to him. Is there another door? The maintenance staircase, in the other wing. Can't you see? What're we doing standing here? Where is it? Well, thank you. Come on, let's go. What's that noise? Why don't we just find an exit. Are all the machines out of order today? They should have turned them off before they left. I don't understand, can't we just get the hell out of here? There's no way out of here. The maintenance staircase is open, it's just the end of the hall. - Sarah should take her medicine. - What medicine? As, I was saying before, we're testing a new drug for epilepsy. Epilepsy? Yeah, the Doctors think that might be the reason... Who gave them permission to test this new drug on her? Unlike the old drug, this drug won't damager her liver. Sure, of course. Look, if we discontinue the use of this medication, the affects could be fatal. What is that? It's coming from over there. Excuse me, ma'am? Ma'am?... Uh... What the hell is going on here? I don't care, it's none of our business, let's get out of here, please. Did you people hear, what I said? Let's get outta here, we need to call for help. She has no eyes, sees it all, makes no difference... they know where we are at all times. - Will you stop it. - Not me, they can't see me. Stop it! Hello! Can anyone hear me? Is anyone there? Can anyone hear me? Is anyone there? What the hell is going on here? Why don't we all just... get outta here? Come on, let's go. After you, you're Security, you go first. Come on. We need to get down, right? So, let's go, come on! Oh, my God. What was that? Hey! Who's there? - Go! Go! - Go! Come on, go! What the hell was that? What was it? There is only one hell. - Sit down. - No, it's just a scratch. I tell you, why don't we make a camp fire and sing songs, while we're at it. Hey! Calm down. While somebody's running around tearing peoples eyes out... you want me to calm down? Don't pay any attention to him honey. Okay? Ben. Look, a bright light or a loud noise can trigger a seizure. We need to stay calm. - What is that? - I haven't heard it before. We can't stay here, we have to find our way out of here. I'm not going down them stairs again. There's an info-desk in the other wing, let's go. Sarah, please wait. Where are we going? You think the info-desk people have a solution to this? You know of a better way to go? - No. - Exactly. The rain stopped. It's almost too quiet. The whole hospital is empty. There's not even a dial tone. Hello! Hello! We're in the north wing on the fifth floor. We need some help. I repeat... If there's something here prying peoples faces... you really wanna announce on the microphone... that we're stuck on the 5th floor? Look! They're on the third floor. What the hell was that? Hey! - At least we're not alone here. - Who gives a shit, just get us outta here. - Well, I don't give a shit. - But that's your job. Isn't anyone else wondering where all the people are? Let's take these, we might need them. - You know how to use them? - Sure. Where is Sarah? Sarah! - Sarah! - Sarah? Sarah! Sarah. Sarah. Sarah are you ok? Sarah? Honey? - Are you ok? - Yeah, everything's ok. Let's just get outta here. - What's in that room? - I don't know nothing of this. Stop, Ben. There's no time like the present... There's no time like the present... - There's no time like the present... - And it's gonna get colder and colder... - There's no time like the present... - And it's gonna get colder and colder... - There's no time like the present... - And it's gonna get colder and colder... Hello? The number you dialed, is not in service at this time. What the... Come on! This is not happening, this is not happening, what was that? Go! Go! I need to switch this off. No don't! Maybe it scared that thing off. Yeah... What in the hell was that? You've seen that before, Tobias? I saw you cover your ears before she even started, so why was that? The Scream Queen. The what? You tell me. What are they doing?... Ben? Why are they here, huh? You know the answer. The emptiness. This is a hospital, and they're doing some repairs. Maybe they hit a gas pipe and were... all high and hallucinating. Hallucinating the same thing at the same time? No, it could be that I'm hallucinating all of this, all of you. Yeah, and you're wearing a night gown, and we're all gonna wake up in any minute. The X-Ray, If we stay here for too long we're gonna be exposed to the radiation. Cancer is not gonna kill any of us. This is shit. You don't want to go out there. This is bullshit, this is just a mass psychosis a body with no eyes... But we all saw it, god-damn it. Yes we did, but it's time to use a little common sense. Fool. I think the rest of us should stay together. So what do we do now? Take the X-Ray machine on our way for help. When is Sarah suppose to take her medication? Soon. What happens if she doesn't get it? Help! Help! - What was that? - John! Help, get me out of here! Open the door! Help me get out! To die... is beautiful. Watch out! Perfect girl. Tobias, what're you doing? It doesn't hurt. Dying is easy. Stop. Stop it... You don't know what are you doing. Oh I know what I'm doing. I know it a hundred times. Tobias. I promise you will sleep. Do you know how it feels, when it's cold... when it's really, really cold? - He looks ok. - Let's pull him out. Come on! Hang in there. What the hell did this? It's all falling apart, everything's falling apart. Sarah, are you feeling ok? Have you seen that? Have you? I want the red crayon. I want the red crayon! Just as soon as we get home, alright? - How are you feeling? - Hurts like hell. That freaking rent-a-cop and his sidekick hit me. You know, you should be thankful your head's still on your shoulders. - You almost got us killed. - Who me? If we didn't have to drag, that retarded kid around with us... we might be out of here already. - Is this real? Huh? - Hey! Stop it! Mass psychosis, huh? Somebody has to take control of the situation. This situation can't be control, not by you, not by anybody. Not by you either. No. Shhh... It's the intercom. - I think I've heard that before. - You should know what that is. Hello, is anyone there? - Hello? - Hello? Hello? What floor are you on? - We're on the... floor. - What floor? What floor? Hello? At least we know we're not alone. Oh yeah, a lot of good it's gonna do, we're all in the same shit. Let's find them. Come on. What the hell? They blocked this exit. Come on Rambo, do something useful. Find us a real way out. You wanted out. - Are staircases behind this? - Yeah, I think so. So much for that. We have to go. Come on. - What the hell happen here? - Only God knows what happen here. Walter! No! Walter. The only sensible solution is to give up the girl... give up the girl... give up the girl... give up the girl... It's up to you. It's all up to you. Let's go. Nobody survived. - Tobias, come! - Let's go! Go! - Ben! - Take her! Let's go! - Go! - Come on, get outta there! Do it! Why did he have to be a god-damn hero? Nobody ask him to be... - Get off of me! - Come on! Looks clear. - They want the girl, you know. - How do you know that? Isn't it obvious, the ghost, the old man's stories, the tape. You starting to believe this. You'll get us killed if you don't... You think I'll let them kill my daughter to save you? And yourself, and the nurse. What if the old man is right? What if it all depends on you? What's happening? Hello? Hello? - What floor are you on? - We're on the third floor. - What floor are you on? - We are on... - Why'd you hang-up? - It was me. What do you mean it was you? It was the same call, I made earlier. There has to be some explanation for this. Maybe an echo. Maybe you accidentally recorded something. No. Maybe it's some kind of parallel dimension thing, you know. Like one world on top of another. My watch is stopped. All the clocks have stopped. What does that mean? I don't know what it means. But time has stopped. It's not moving. Look. - How can time stop? - I don't know. - Sarah, what is it? - She needs to take her medicine. Where do we get it? The emergency room bed, It's behind that blocked wall. You stay here. We'll clear that wall. If you do get outta here? What're you gonna do with time stopped? Right now, I just wanna get my child the hell outta here. Let's all worry about that later. Sarah everythings gonna be ok. Daddy's gonna get you outta here, ok? Can you watch her. Don't even lay a finger on her. You won't live to regret it. No. No. That's the fastest way down. Have you huh... seen Sarah's drawings? - Yeah, I've seen a lot of them. - What do you make of them? I think she knows something we don't. - Don't start with that. - Ben... when you were gone, I heard Sarah speak with Tobias. I didn't hear what she said, but she spoke clearly and didn't repeat herself. She's just a little girl. Why is everyone keep saying she is the reason for this? And what if she is? I touched Tobias' hand, it was cold. It was like he was dead. What's this? Sand? - Guns never really helped. - Yeah, but We'll never know. What're you drawing? That's ok, you don't have to show me. That's ok! It's ok. You know Sarah's gonna be ok. Do you have children? I have a boy, he's four. And the father? I haven't seen him in a couple of years. I'm sorry. Don't be, he wasn't the kind of man who... - What was that? - I don't know. This... what the hell? This is Johns', he dropped' them, remember? - Hey wait. - Ed, I need to tell them. They'll say it was me, I just shot Rick in the head. It's what they'd say, if they saw you. Come on, why don't you and I, take a little walk? Have a lot of fun. Shhh... - What? - Did you hear that? What the hell is that? Come and get her! You can take her. You can have her. Come and get her! We just wanna get out. She's here, you can have her. - She's not yours... to give away. - Get... - What if it's really is true? - What? If I don't give them Sarah, this is never gonna stop. If they wanted Sarah, why don't they just take her? Hello? Hello? That idiot there, want's them to have... Sarah. - What? Tobias? - It's Sarah. You... you are one of them. Have you ever been cold? I mean really, really cold. Cold enough for you? Sarah! Sarah! Here she is! Hey! No, no, no... Sarah! Sarah! Everything's ok. Who is that? Ben, here. - Is he dead? - It's like he's been dead for a week. - We have to go. - Yeah. We should be able to reach the ground floor from here. Get the chair. No, no... not there... not there. Do you know how to get out from here? No... no... - Can you draw it for me? - No... This way? I think we can find Sarah's medicine in here. - Did you find it? - No, will you check that one. Could be some other way out through the garage. Yeah, the Staff go through the mortuary to reach the garage... even if the Chief tells them not to. We don't need the Chief, to make an exception. Oh shit! Sarah! Look! She can't go far, you check over there, I'll check this way. - Keep your walkie-talkie on. - Okay. Sarah! Sarah? Sarah!? Ben. Can you hear me? Ben? Emily, talk to me, where are you? Ben! Excuse me. Can you help me? Excuse me, can you help me? Can anybody please help me? Where is my daughter? Sarah! Ben, can you hear me? Ben, where are you? I don't know huh... there were people and they... What? Where? The Emergency Room, but Sarah is not there. - Where are you? - I'm outside room 235. Ok, I'm coming. - I can't hear you. - I'm right in front of room 235. You must be in a different hallway. Ben, there's only one 235 in this hospital. There's a teddy bear poster beside it. Ben? Ben? Ben? Ben? Ben, can you hear me? I found Sarah... she's... Finally. - Not that way. - Sarah? - Where are you going? - It has to stop. What're you talking about? Ben! What happened? I don't know, there were these people... but, it was like they couldn't see me, or something... Ben. Get Sarah. It's ok, we're gonna get you out of here soon. What the hell? Emily. Emily, I gotta get you... No, take Sarah, you can come back for me later. No, that is not going to happen. Okay. No... We need to get outta here! - Just try to hold on, baby. - She's sleeping into a coma. Through those doors we can get to the garage. Come on, let's go! Ben! Emily! Emily! Oh God... Open up this door! It's ok, I'm gonna get you outta there. - Please, open this door! - It's stuck. Please, please, please... Please, open it... No, God... It's coming. It's coming. - It's here, it's here. - Sarah, What's here? Hold on, baby! Sarah, you're alright? Again and again and again... How the hell, do we get outta here? No, no, no, no, no... This can't be happening. Everyone will die. What happens, will happen. Sarah please, If you know how to stop this, do it. What happens, will happen. What happens, will happen. Okay... It's not your fault, it's not. It's not your fault. You stay here, ok? Someone will come and get you. Hey... Sleep tight, baby, sleep tight. Don't let those bed-bugs bite. I love you. Somebody will come and get you. Sarah. Sarah. What're you doing here? No. Try to hold on for another minute, baby. No, not anymore. I'd like to go home now. You don't understand, light can't live in darkness. No, you're not going to do that. Sarah, I don't feel cold anymore. I want a blue crayon. I want a blue crayon.
