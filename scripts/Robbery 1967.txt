Now - hard right! We didn't make the corner. We're after him again! Good boy. Move it, move it! All right. [CHlLDREN TALKING] Over you go. [TEACHER SHOUTING] Children - wait for it to stop! [SHOUTING AND SCREAMlNG] Stay where you are!!! We're gonna hit them! We're gonna hit them! NO!!! Charlie Delta Two, what is your position? Charlie Delta Two, do you read me? - Is there anybody hurt? - We're all right. Did you see the driver? Sshhh. Contact lost with suspect. Unable to continue pursuit. We've crashed outside the Quentin Pope... ...Junior School. Would you recognise that driver? What? [CRYlNG CHlLDREN] Would you recognise the driver? Yes, of course I'd recognise the bastard! - Bye, Kate. l'll see you this evening. - What time? - Oh, I shouldn't be late. - All right. lf anything crops up I'll phone you. All right. Bye bye. - I'll be right with you. - You'll never be right with me, Jack! Hello, George. What can I do for you? l'd like a little chat about a car. Oh? Talk about cars all day, if you like? A silver Jag? - Thinking of buying it? - No. No, I, er... ...I was just wondering who was driving it. Ah. Someone pulled a job, eh? No. No, not me, Inspector. l jacked that lot in - it's a... ...it's a mug's game, isn't it? Well, I mean, there's no point... ...now I've got the job... - ...and the business. - How is business? Can't complain. ls, er... ...is he with you..? Never saw him in my life before. Got a warrant, lnspector? What? For a social call? This bloke's a better actor than Mickey Mouse. Well, er... ...I'll be seein' yer, Jack. Six-Oh-Three-Eight-Seven-Four-Two. Scotland Yard here. Sergeant! - Your call on number three. - Oh, thanks. Right, she's already made three insurance claims. Get onto Bedford, see ifthey've got anything on her. Right you are, guv'nor. George. Go carefully, eh? Remember who her father is. - Well? - Nothing. - Still think Jack's the driver? - That's my best guess. This is the Squad, Inspector Langdon. We deal in evidence and arrests, not guesses. l think you're right about him. He's our man - but we've got to... ...get evidence and we've got to make it stick. You've got to make it stick! Yes, sir. That was a close one yesterday, love. Mmm. Did you see the papers? - Eighty-five thousand quid? - Nah. Not a penny over seventy-five... ...and that's trade valuation. Not what we got. Yeah... they're all at it. - Where's Paul? - He'll be here. l've had the law round. That was quick! Who was it? Langdon. Hi. Evening. Jack's had callers. The Squad. Yeah. Langdon... a try-on. Does he know anything? - What? Him? - Does he know anything? Of course not! Well, let's keep it that way. Here's how it is, then. We've got the capital now for the investment. We all agree to go ahead? - Yep. - Yeah. Well, why don't we share out in the usual way? I mean... ...we're doing all right. l want us to do better, Frank. l dunno. lf there's one thing l know... ...money breeds money. Huh, mine must be on the pill. All right, Frank - I'll pay you off. l'll find another firm that's interested... ...in three or four million pounds. Four million! Bloody hell! Frank? l'm interested. Jack? Yeah, yeah. Count me in. The job, Paul? lt's a night mail train. From Glasgow to London. The Tuesday after the holiday. What? - Not till after the holiday? - Exactly. The banks will have been closed... ...from midday Saturday... ...till Tuesday morning. There'll be that much more money on the train. What happens to the money afterwards? A friend of ours flies it out of the country within the hour. Ahh! [CHUCKLlNG] Where do we share out? Switzerland? Share's delivered wherever you like. l know where l want mine delivered. Okay? There's just one more thing. This is the big one - the biggest. From now until we finish the job, I want no... ...trouble with the law. You understand, Jack? Me? l'll be as good as gold. We've got nothing to worry about then, have we? Bloke askin' for you, Mr Aitken. - What sort of bloke? - A bloke! How much you getting for these? - Shopping, Inspector? - Not today. You know who I am, Aitken? l'm making enquiries into a... ...robbery at Northumberland Avenue - ten days ago. l have reason to believe you can be of assistance. l must ask you if you're willing... ...to be put up for an identity parade. We're very formal all of a sudden. ls this an invitation? Would you rather it were printed? Uh, I've got to go out... ...but I'll be back before you go to lunch. - No, I don't recognise anyone. - That will be all, thank you. - Good morning, miss. - Morning. Now, all I want you to do is just to go along the line... ...and ifyou recognise the man you thought... ...you saw in the car, just touch him. All right? - Okay. - All right. That's all right, miss - if you'll go with the policewoman. Gentlemen. We're very grateful for your time. That will be all, thank you. [MEN TALKlNG] Yeah, waste of time, this. - Don't rate his ugly mug. - No, neither do I. This way, please. Now, I want you to go along the line... ...and ifyou recognise the man... [SCUFFLlNG AND SHOUTING] Get him out of here. - Take him off. - I'm sorry, I--- - ...I'm sorry, I didn't mean... - Right, that'll be all. Thank you, gentlemen. l want a summons for assault. - You're in trouble, Jack. - Naahhh. - Get--- - Jack! Look... ...I'm just tryin' to help you. Make a statement. Tell us who else was in on it. l've got nothing to make a statement about. Ahhh... ...do yourself a favour. What do you mean? You saw what she did. Who? That bloody schoolteacher! How did you know she was a schoolteacher? That stuff will kill you. l thought you said you were already in condition? [WHEEZING] l thought l was! How are things going? Made a start on the drivers. Like who? So far, Mike... ...Pete... ...and those two we used on the furjob. Mike's good. The other one talks too much. You know that. You want two drivers to every car, right? l want everybody doubled up... ...and no weak sisters. So, l'll keep trying. - How about the railway end? - All fixed. Four of our lads are now railwaymen. Fully paid up. - What about electricians? - Not easy. Ben's got one or two good lads... ...but he's not going to settle... ...for wages - he'll want a cut. Talk to him. How about your friend the banker? Robinson? He's in prison. We'll have to get him out. We'll need his knowledge of bank security... ...and for the bank notes. Only an expert can tell the safe ones. So we'll have to get him out. - Just like that? - Yeah. You could have a problem there. Ha, he's worth it. We'll split here - see you, Dave. Zero. Seventy-three pieces, sir. Thank you. Fifty-two pieces for your spend. You're straight up, sir. Thank you. Three hundred thousand. And a cut of the profits. Straight. How much you expect? Somewhere in the low millions. - I'll take a cut. - Uh-uh. Dave, darling... ...I've missed you, where have you been? Go away, baby - I'm busy. Ask me later. Percentage or forget it. How much? Twenty-five percent. We'll work for you, Ben. Take it or leave it. l'll put it to the board. Fine. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty... ...seventy, eighty, ninety - a hundred pounds. Place your bets, please. All bets on? Twenty-two. You win, Mr Aitken. Place your bets, please. [NEWSREADER] "On the day of the funeral a general strike was declared and---" Welcome to J Wing, Robinson. What a pity you won't be staying long. W-what do you mean? What are you talking about? You're going over the wall, Robinson. Tomorrow: four-ten exercise, west wall. l don't want any trouble. Neither does your wife, l should imagine. Or the boy. How old will he be now? Why me? l don't know, Robinson... ...and I don't care. All I know is you go over the wall tomorrow... ...even if I have to throw you over myself. Right. Let's run through it. Uh, four hundred yards on the left... ...bottom of the incline, there's a road to the junction. Half a mile beyond that... ...there's a sharp right-hander. Then a crossing. After the crossing... ...there's no turn-off till you get to the main road. Keep it at forty. How many turnings off the main road? Er, nine. How many of those can we use as alternative routes? Fi... six, l think. Five. Five or six, what does it matter? lt matters. Let's get back to the bridge a different way. You've got... six minutes. What kind of recruiting? Specialists? All kinds, apparently. Drivers. - Electricians. - Electricians? Any names? You know I never can remember names. Who's "the money"? The talk is it's from that diamond job. Any more on that? Had to be the mob we were talking about. None of them's spending. And that's interesting, isn't it, Mr Langdon? Very interesting. Keep listening. Three-sixteen. Two minutes late. We can't have that, can we? Hmm, no. What's the average? lt's never more than six minutes... ...over the past ten days. That was my smoke you took. Smoke? l never 'ad your smoke! Why don't you shut your mouth or I'll... - ...put one on you! - You'll do what? Hey! Hey! Break it up! Break it up there! [SHOUTING AMONGST PRISONERS] How much do you think there is tonight, Bob? lf you take three million as an average... ...there could be four million tonight. Judging by the number of sacks. ls that high-value coach always in second position? Has been all week. Have you found an engine driver for me yet? l've got one in mind. Have we found out anything about this, Jock? Yes, sir. Kidderminster Laboratories... ...confirmed it WAS one of... ...those stolen at the time of the break-in last year. The timing mechanism's the kind of... ...thing you can buy at most shops. Any one of half a dozen specialists... ...could have rigged the two together. Which gets us nowhere. Do you think the diamonds are still in the country? lfAitken's behind it? No. - You've charged Jack? - Yes. - He's not speaking, of course? - No! l take it Number One District's... ...keeping an eye on the Aitken mob? Round the clock. Frankly, I would have thought this job... ...far too sophisticated for Aitken on his own. l couldn't agree more. Who's behind it? Somebody with some brains. [TELEPHONE RINGING] And not only that... There's someone who's recruiting - and only top specialists. - Pretty strong rumours to that effect. - [ON TELEPHONE] Yes? lnformation received? - Yes, sir. - [ON TELEPHONE] It's positive? Right, George - you keep on to this. You'll get all the help... - ...you need from Number One District. - [ON TELEPHONE] Yes, he's here now. l'll tell him. [ON TELEPHONE] Well done, David. lt's the Rosary Gardens strangling, sir. Renshaw's at Harrow Road now and he'll be charged tonight. Water-tight? Absolutely. Well done, Mike. Smart arrest by the young detective... ...in Paddington, l thought. Good. Well, come on lads... ...let's get this over with. l've got a meeting with the... ...Commissioner in ten minutes. Now, then... ...anything fresh on the Robinson escape? Well, he had outside help, of course... ...but I think we'll have him back... ...inside in a matter of days. Reasons? Well, he's an amateur, sir. "Good conduct" man. First-time loser. No underworld connections. Who helped him over the wall, then? Well, he probably made friends inside. What? They sprung him for love? Let's hear your thinking, George. Well, I think somebody wanted Robinson out, sir. l've got his file here. Listen to this. lt says: "...the accused was attached to security department... "...of his bank shortly after promotion from chief cashier." "He handled matters concerned with..." "...safety and care of bank vaults..." "...and safeguarding high-value currency." The Case Officer added... ... that "...he made no use of this..." "...knowledge but committed straight-forward embezzlement." So? Well, that's why Robinson's out. Somebody's planning a big job... ...and they need his know-how! Maybe. Well, I'll get on to records... ...sir, and get a rundown on the jail friends... ...past and present. l think it'll be useful. Any idea whatjob they could be planning? Er, something special, and I, er... ...think I know when. More "information received"? No, sir. The calendar. My guess is it's due over the Bank Holiday when the... ...banks are closed for three days. That will give them three days and nights... ...to open up the bank vaults. But l, er, know you dislike guesswork, sir. There's a time and place for it. l think you might be right. So, lads - you can tell your delighted wives... ...that Squad leave is restricted over the Bank Holiday. That's all. l just want to speak to her! Just for a moment. She's not alone. But of course she is! That woman sitting over there is a policewoman. How do you know? lt's a special brand of perfume they wear. Use your head, Robinson. Your wife's followed wherever she goes. What do you expect? To think that I--- Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Well, now you know what you're risking. l wasn't feeling sorry for myself, you know? l've had time to think. Night after night. What did you think about? About my family. How I can make it up to them for what I've done. Well, a hundred thousand pounds would help, wouldn't it? lf I do what you want... ...what happens to them? They'll be brought out to Switzerland, to join you. Passports provided. We'd never be able to come home again. Home is a Swiss bank account. l'd be hunted for the rest of my life. You will be anyway. You're an escaped convict, remember? Switzerland's your best bet. You'll have one hundred thousand pounds in the bank... ...and your boy will speak three languages. Huh. lt was your idea started the whole thing, remember? Something we talked about in prison. Passed the time. Probably. l'm not sure. Robinson, you're in! You were in the moment you came over that wall. That last rehearsal wasn't good enough. There were two men without gloves on. Your men, Ben. Frank, one of your drivers jumped the gun. Don't they know the order they leave in? He was nervous. l'm paying for nerve... ...not nerves. What about the equipment, Don? Three of the radio units didn't work... ...and I couldn't read the signal from the spotter. l'd like doubles of everything, including batteries. - Frank? - Sure. How was the timing? Too slow. - Things will be easier on the night, we'll be--- - It was too slow! We've got forty-five minutes at the outside. l want it done in twenty-five. You fellas think you gonna bust... ...a high-value security van in twenty-five minutes? lt won't be a high-value security van. The regular vans will be out of action. Fixed. The substitute one will be easy. - Do we provide the shooters? - No guns! What happens if things get sticky? Turn on the charm, Ben. - Now, look--- - No guns. l want no violence, no accidents. They don't carry guns, we don't need them. Five million quid and no guns. They don't carry guns. And they've never been done. Still think we should have 'em. Why, in case someone should disturb your hair? l can handle myself, I just... ...don't reckon getting caught. Nobody does. lf you're caught with a shooter it's... ...three times the sentence. Okay, okay - no guns. Now, about the share-out. What about the share-out? l don't like the idea of the money leaving... ...the country before the payout. l want mine before we split up. We're talking about millions of pounds, now. We're talking about road blocks, car searches... ...house raids, shake-downs. They'll know who pulled the job. Without the money they can't prove anything. You said the notes won't be traceable. You'll get the money... ...when it's safe. Okay. That's it, then. My boys are out. And mine. We can't do it on our own. No. We'll have to postpone it, then. No. Frank, get them back. Cash on the nail - right after the job. lt means we'll have to hide out till we've counted it. We'll be pinned down and the law will be swarming. So we need a hide-out. Close by. lnside the police cordon, with all that money. Could be the safest place. l still like Switzerland. Not for us. That's that, then. Means the boys will have to be briefed again... ...and thoroughly. Dave will tell you when we've got a hide-out. And the next time we meet... ...will be on the money train. - Inspector Langdon? - Ah, yes. - One prisoner. - Thank you. - Much obliged to you. - Thank you. Sit down. Take off the cuffs. l thought we might have another little chat. We're informal here. Left it a bit late, haven't you? [LITTLE LAUGH] My mind seems to work better at night. - Do you ever find that? - No. Tell me about the Robinson escape? ls it a wall picture? What's this big job comin' up? l don't know anythin' about any "big job". Jack... ...come off it now. You know me - I'm not talking. Well, I've got all night. Well, I don't know. What a mug. You're in 'ere, they're out there. Do you think they're giving you a thought right now? Do you know Paul Clifton? Come back to bed, Kate. Why? What's wrong? Tell me. "Never again." "From now on..." "...straight and narrow." "I'll never put you through that again, Kate." You bloody hypocrite! Oh, well - what's a little cheating, here and there? lt's happening all over. You're imagining things. Come on! Paul, I know you. Kate. Have you ever been to three movies... ...in a day and had no idea what you'd seen? What are you talking about? l'm talking about how... ...long a day is when you're alone. Think I don't know about that? Yes! You were in prison, Paul. l was alone. l wanted you to give us a home, but you never will. So what makes you so different... ...from any other man I might want to go to bed with? And don't think I don't want to go to... ...bed with a man when you're inside. Don't think your friends don't offer. l think you've had too much to drink. l don't care what you think. l don't care if you don't think. But you do think. You're the Last of the Big Thinkers, aren't you? Who's been talking to you? And there you are. You start cheating, Paul, you end up... ...thinking everyone else is cheating, too. This doesn't help. lt helps. lt helps a little. How about that? l'm at the stage where l settle for a little. You wouldn't settle for a little, would you, Paul? You're big. l'm going back to bed. How big are you, Paul? l'm talking about the gun... ...in the drawer, in the bedroom. - What's the gun for, Paul? - The gun is nothing. You don't need a gun... ...to go straight. - It's nothing. - Don't lie, Paul! - Say it! - Kate. You never used to need a gun. - No, you used to--- - SHUT UP! Darling. You tell me what the gun's for... ...and I'll come back to bed. [DEEP SlGHlNG] Oh, what's it for, Paul? Because l'm not going back inside. Not again. Dave? There's a grey car coming. An Austin. SHUT UP! Shout it from the bloody rooftops. Be glad when we've got the radios. - Thanks, Ken. - How's it going? - I haven't seen those sleeping bags. - They're in the back of the Austin. KEEP YOUR BLOODY GLOVES ON!!! l've put the call through on this line, sir. Thank you. Hello. lsabella's on her way. And she's well up to weight. Good. Keep your messages brief. Remember... ...while they're not in use they can't be traced. Any questions? [MUTTERING] No. Yeah, where's the rest of the crew? They'll be here. l hope they're not comin' by train! lf there are no more... ...serious questions, we'll get into position. ls that you, Doctor? [OVER TELEPHONE] CLIFTON: "The baby arrived on time and is well up to weight." Come on, come on. We don't move till we get the word. Here he comes. Hello, Number One. Are you receiving me? Over. Receiving you, Number Two. l'm in position and clear. [POLICE RADIO lN THE BACKGROUND] Anything from the police? Just routine. Gimme the walkie-talkie. Everything all right? The telephone lines to the houses have been cut. They should be here to fix the signal phone any moment. l telephoned our man in Ireland. He'll fly in and pick up our share... ...of the money as soon as l let him know. Wish we were going out with it tonight. ls Kate joining you afterwards? Ben's boys giving you any trouble? No. They seem to be good workers. You left Robinson back at the bunker. Yeah. He can chew his nails till we get back with the money. l'll get back to the bridge. Out of sight, down the road. What do you make of this? - Bedford. - Bedford, eh? What did you put in 'ere? - It's lovely. - We all hate it. lt's horrible. Have some Settlers. Not me, gives me indigestion. Operator, I've been trying to call Monarch Oh-One-Oh-Eight... ...and it seems to be out of order. Could, could you, um... ...help me, please? It's very, very important. [OPERATOR] "Would you hang on a minute, please?" [OPERATOR] "Scotland Yard? That Monarch number is..." [OPERATOR] "...being called. We are tracing it..." [OPERATOR] "...but I thought you might be interested in speaking to the caller." Yes, we're very interested. Thank you for passing it on. Hello. This is the Exchange Supervisor. Uh, who are you calling? l'm... ...I've been trying to call Mrs Robinson. Monarch Oh-One-Oh-Eight. And it seems to be out of order. Could you have the line... ...tested for me, please? lt's very urgent. Yes. Certainly, sir. Uh, what is your number? Well, I'm calling you from... [SCOTLAND YARD ON PHONE] Hello? Hello, sir. What number are you speaking from? She's comin'. [OVER WALKIE-TALKIE] She's comin'. SHE'S PASSING ME NOW! Better not be bloody late tonight. WHAT'S UP, MATE? HOW LONG YOU GONNA BE HERE? WHAT?

Six minutes gone - nineteen minutes to go. We're behind schedule. Start her up... ...and keep going, but slowly. You can go a bit faster. And keep your eyes out for a marker. A red marker, further down the line. Keep your eyes down! And stop when I tell you. And when I say stop, you stop - or you'll get some more. What's the chance of getting some tea? lt's coming. GET DOWN! ON THE FLOOR! - Get them down. - ON THE FLOOR! ALL ON THE FLOOR! Come on! Outside - into line. Dead on time. How much longer have we got? About five minutes. Hold it! Right! - Right, that's it. Out! - There's only a few left! Time's up! Out! Don't move for half an hour. We're leaving a man behind. Anybody moves will be killed. lf you have any trouble - shoot! No, the mail train hasn't come through here yet. Well, if your lights are at red, it must still be in section. Mine are all at green. Yes, everything seems to be all right here. All right, I'll check again. Come on, let's 'ave yer! Will you put them all in one pile, please? Are there any more? No, only this one down 'ere. l want one... one at a time over here... ...and don't open more than one at a time. - All right, come on, get in. Up, up. - That's it. We'll be back in forty-five minutes. Right, I'll set up something to occupy the law. You all know where to go. Stick to your routes, and no speeding. Hello. Langdon. Who? Oh, yeah, yeah. Have they traced the call? ls that the best they can do? Yes, I agree. lt could be Robinson. Yeah, l'll get up there straight away. Put them round the back! Round the back! Seven thousand pounds, in new notes. As agreed. This calls for a celebration. There shouldn't be any fingerprints on the vehicles... ...but someone may have been careless. Drink? No. Don't worry, Paul... ...I'll have them cleaned up. When do you want them? ln about three days. l'll phone you. lt depends when you're pulling the job, I suppose. The less you know, the better.

[POLICE RADIO] "...county CID." - [POLICE RADIO] "Origin: Oh-Seven-Three-Five---" - What's Langdon doin' up 'ere? Jack's talked. Jack wouldn't tell a policeman the time. [MEN TALKlNG IN THE BACKGROUND] That's if they can remember it. No one's talked! The local police called the Squad in. They're out of their depth. Come on, Robinson. Let's be 'avin' yer! [MEN TALKlNG IN THE BACKGROUND] l wanna take her to Paris. - Bless her. - Yeah. A hundred thousand pounds of this is yours. Something wrong with the notes? Some of the fivers are rejects, of course. Burn them yourself, along with the wrappers. Yeah... ...as soon as l'm through with this batch. Still worried about your wife? Well... if only l could talk with her. Anyone calling Monarch Oh-One-Oh-Eight will be traced. They're bound to be tapping the line. You haven't called her, have you? l never even got through, Paul. l-I just wanted to hear her. Who'd he call? His wife. Where'd you call her from? Telephone box, down the lane. lt's a quarter of a mile from here. l never got through. They couldn't have known it was me. What do we do with him? Leave it. Paul - listen, please. You go on checking. - Can I help you, sir? - Good morning, yes. Beg pardon, sir. - Yes? - A Mr Langdon. - Morning, sir. - Morning. Who are you? Uh, Inspector Langdon, sir... ...Flying Squad. l see. That was quick work. How did you people get to know? Oh, I didn't. l just happened to be in the neighbourhood.

We traced the call, sent a car to the box - but he'd gone. - Oh, well, could you direct me to the--- - Sorry, Inspector... ...hate to appear uncooperative.
