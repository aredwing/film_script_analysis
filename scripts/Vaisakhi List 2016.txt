East or west, this place is the best. The wise have been right. There's no place like home. This is where l always feel like home. Sir, l think you love this place. The only difference in maternal and paternal uncles is the way they think. Yes One's your mother's brother-in-law and the other your father's This is how differently you and l think You think this is a jail. Whereas l think of this as my home. Think about it. lf even after getting paid such lucrative salaries you think of it as jail.. ..how would those innocent ones feel who have been in there since ages. Being a jailer, you love your prisoners so much l have always seen the violent side of the police. This is the first time l am seeing their affectionate side. Bahadur Singh. - Sir. A mother keeps a child in her womb only for nine months. And see how much she loves them. l have kept them here for 19 years.. So think how much attached l am with them. They are rotting in here and not being released. l am sure there might be other officers like me.. ..who love their prisoners, but they cannot show it. Because this is what everyone is taught during the training.. ..that you have to even suspect your wife even if you bad intentions for her. Anyway, l don't have a wife. Hence, l give my wife's share of love also to them. What? - Yes You too should love these so-called prisoners like your cousins - Okay. Sir, one of them is my real cousin. l had told you about him. Oh, very good. And you two too. Get all your cousins who are in different prisons transferred here. So that we can make them feel at home. Yes sir. - That is great, sir. Sir, if we take the population into consideration.. ..mothers should first of all stop giving birth to sons But if they do, they should give birth.. ..to sons like the great jailer Jolawar Singh Johal. lt's not easy to give birth to sons like Jolawar Singh Johal. l know what my mother had to go through to give birth to me. My mother went to every possible temple, mosque, church. My mother waited for 21 years to have a child. 21 long years Then, sir? When she turned 22, she got married to my father. And that's when Jolawar Singh came into this world. Shut up. Work during working hours and joke during your free time. Never forget these three things Jolawar Singh Johal. Sir, you keep an amazing balance between affection and strictness l don't think any prisoner has every escaped from your prison. Tulsidas, l sometimes like what you say. You are talking about running away? Forget about running away.. After their sentence is over, l have to request them to leave. "Please leave, brothers." lf we start keeping ex-prisoners here the number will increase.. ..to appoint where we will have divide this place into PUDA approved sectors Some time ago, prisoner number 107 made a few failed attempts to escape. He came back the same way he went and said; "How are you doing? Please forgive me." "l bow before you. Now this is my home." "l surrender my life to you." Tarseen, what were you putting to dry over there under this scorching sun? l go for a walk after lunch. Great. l cannot believe that l am talking to the same person.. ..who tried to run away from here a couple of times, 15 months ago. He has given up on all his bad habits and has become so health conscious. ..that he has accepted this place from the bottom of his heart. Jailer Jolawar Singh Johal salutes you, unofficially. What are you doing? This is nothing, son. l feel like bowing before you. No, please don't do that. l agree that you haven't done anything crazy in the past 14 months. But l cannot ignore the fact that once.. ..a person is infected with the escape virus.. ..it came became active in him anytime. That's true. - What? l mean you are right. One more thing, Never get this filmy feeling in your mind.. "There is no prison in the world that can keep Tarseen Lal inside." So my brother, this isn't a prison. This is an unfortunate place.. ..which you need to make fortunate with your presence. Now you are embarrassing me. This is what l want. l want you to be embarrassed. So that you don't embarrass me. This uniform has always been spotless. And l always want it to remain ultra clean. As far as facilities are concerned, l am here to provide them. l need Fleet boots, size nine. - What? To go on walks. Size nine, no l will get you size ten. We will build a running track for you. You can run on it day and night. l don't care whether or not you build a track. But l will accept whatever you say. Now the prisoners will run from there. Jarnail! Jarnail! A girl has come to meet you Me? - Not even a man would come to meet you. She has come to meet the other Jarnail. Jarnail! Jarnail! A girl has come to meet you Aman! Jarnail! ls everything all right? My marriage has been fixed. Your marriage has been fixed? l tried convincing my father, but he didn't give in. And you gave in? l've been fighting with my family ever since you were arrested. Relatives taunt my father that he got a drug peddler for his daughter! And you too joined the crowd You very well know that l am not involved in this. l was framed And you also know who framed me. Till when will you keep suspecting my brother? People keep talking about you How do l make them shut up? You don't know the condition l am in. And me? What about me? Jarnail.. l spend each day in this prison thinking about.. ..getting out of here and starting afresh with you. l am already enduring a punishment.. And you are giving me another one. Please forgive me. l won't. Go and talk to your father again. lt's too late, Jarnail. l am getting married tomorrow. And you are informing me about it today? What would have you done if l would have told earlier? You would have eloped with me? No, right? You would think about it in the prison and die a little every day. You are not leaving me alive either today. Think of me as a bad dream. You are cheating me. Why did you commit if you didn't want to carry through? Answer me. You cannot marry anyone else. You cannot make my life difficult. Now we both have a difficult life ahead of us, Jarnail. lt's difficult for you to live without me.. ..and for me to live with someone else. "You go away, and it gets difficult to breathe." "All the dreams that l had start to shatter." "You go away, and it gets difficult to breathe." "All the dreams that l had start to shatter." "A never-ending.." "A never-ending sorrow is what you have given me." "You have given my eyes the reason to shed tears." "You have given my eyes the reason to shed tears." What's the scene here, sir? He is a lover. He is being sacrificed because of love. He has a very short story. Come on out. Hurry up. Coming, What's the hurry? Are you getting married? Yes l am going to meet my future wife. l am running late. Tell me, which intermediary is getting the ring? Aunt Bachno. You should have told me. All l get is milk. And Bachno gets the ring. She has found a very beautiful girl. Forget a ring l would gift her an entire sector. Anyway.. Bye. Bless you. He looked at her photo and gave his consent. Now we are waiting for your consent. How much do you make, son? Around Rs 30000 a month l have five buffalos They gave 50 litres of milk l drink around 2 litres of that. And then 50 litres is sold But, if you drink 2 litres then it should leave you with 48 litres How do you manage to sell 50 litres? Well.. l adjust. No matter what he does but he is honest. He is a gem of a person. He might be an orphan but he does not have any vice. And then, l am here to clear all doubts Son, do you have any demands? Don't embarrass me. l won't even let you spend a penny on the wedding. Bachchan Kaur, l like him. - Then get the sweets. - Of course, right away. Balbir Kaur. - Coming! Mummy, you couldn't find anyone better for Aman? The match that l told you, was it bad? One druggie is enough is this family. You want me to marry your sister to a druggie? How do the drugs harm her? He owns 7 acres of land This one won't even have seven milk cans Satwinder! -Coming. Move back - Come fast. Coming, l came. - Balbir, l like him. So should we fix the marriage? Yes, of course. l like him. Here son, eat some sweets - Congratulations, sister. - Congratulations to you too. Jarnail, if you want to talk to the girl in private then go ahead. ls it okay? Yes. -Yes, of course. Why not? By the way, do you like me? Not at all. You know what is arranged marriage and love marriage, right? l don't want to go for arranged marriage. The boy l don't know anything about.. The boy l don't love.. How can l spend my life with him? People get married You fall in love after marriage. What is the guarantee? l can give guarantee for myself. l am sure to fall in love with you. l don't know about you That's why l don't want to get married. When l'll fall in love, l'll get married Please, can you say no to my father? Please. Even my relatives know that l had fallen for you. ..just by looking at your photograph. l.. - l don't know. Just gather yourself and say no before you leave. But son, you just said yes to us. What happened in five minutes? l like your daughter a lot. And l don't want to lose her. A priest had told me that my first marriage wouldn't work.. ..but the second one will. So l was wondering, l should first get married to someone else.. ..and then marry your daughter. So, tell me. Take this crazy boy away from here. You found such a boy for my daughter? Brother, listen to me. l don't want to listen anything. Take this boy away from here. Listen. Hold this. You came Jarnail. You had gone to meet a girl. So did you fix the marriage? No. Things didn't work out. Why? Who ruined it? Yes. -Who? The girl. What? Don't ask too many questions l am still in shock Bye. Bye, uncle. Madam, this is a good service you have started. ..of teaching English to senior citizens in the evening in the school. l shall learn Punjabi later. You should first teach me how to read and write in English Next week my grandchildren are coming here from Canada. l cannot stand in front of them like a dummy. How can l teach it so quickly? l don't want to become a scholar in English.. Just teach me how to take my grandchildren's names. What's so difficult in their names? Tell them. Sylvester and Suzanne. l feel giddy when l try to pronounce them. Fine. Fill the admission form. You can join the class from tomorrow. l'm running late for my class. - Okay. Okay. Let's go, son. Okay, let's go ahead now. M for Monkey. Monkey means. -Cat. Not a cat, a primate. Come what may, you guys will never learn English. How are you doing, dear? Good? Hello. - Hello. You are here. -Yes l thought a lot after we met. You are right. One should go for love marriage. l am with you. Thank you. Bye. - Hold on. Are you doing around with someone? What do you mean? l mean do you have a boy in mind for your love marriage? You don't go looking, you just fall in love. So you agree that it just happens, right? lt happened to me. -What happened? l think l am in love. Are you feeling all right? What kind of things are you discussing with me over here? Let's go sit elsewhere and talk. Let's go to your house and talk. You should better get yourself treated by a doctor of your village. My village's doctor is on the verge of commit suicide because of a girl. How will he treat anyone? Look, l am done beating around the bush. The truth is, l am in love with you. Look, l am not that kind of a girl. 365 facets of women doom the men. That day you said that you want to go for love marriage. Today you say that l am not that kind of a girl. What happened, son? Nothing. We were just settling the bill. Do it. You should stick to your story. -Yes l will do love marriage with the one l will fall in love. Then fall in love with me. l don't sell curdled milk. Madam, are you facing any trouble from the students? No, ma'am. All the students are good. Good. - Principal madam, have you started milk service in the school? No. Why? There is a milkman outside. What is he doing here? l am here to learn. l too want to learn English. Welcome. But before we teach English, we teach Punjabi. Punjabi runs in my veins After l was born, the first word l uttered was 'Udha'. l spoke the mother tongue before l said mother. Fine, l will register your name. What is your name? - Jarnail. - Jarnail, please have a seat. Ok Hello. Madam, what do we call a milkman in English? l tell you. Lover. - Good, now l learnt this as well. A milkman is called lover in English. Aman! Aman! Aman! - Please listen to me. - l don't want to hear a word. l don't want to go for either love marriage or arranged marriage. Please leave me alone. Talk softly, don't get me expelled from the school. You don't want to go for either love marriage or arranged marriage. What's the third kind of marriage? Let me know. l shall make arrangements for that. lf you have, any brains then try to understand. l don't want to marry you. - But why? - What is wrong with me? - What is right with you? You are not educated You don't have any brains. Madam, from where do l get brains like you? You want to put 500 ml of milk in a 250 ml container. - This is how rustic l am. - l don't want a rustic. Who is standing there with your sister? l want to.. Who is he? No matter how much ever a dog runs after a car, he can never ride it. Get this straight.. lf l don't get married to Aman, you will have to arrange for your own drugs. Yes, brother? Lovers tend to get beaten up a lot in our village. No village has ever respected lovers. By the way, l didn't go there to romance. l had gone to resolve an issue. Let me resolve your issue. Do you know who he is? No. - He too doesn't know you Let me introduce you. Binder.. he is the boy who had come to get married to my sister. And he is the boy my sister will get married to. Get going. l don't want to see you again. Kick and leave. l told you to kick-start the bike. Sorry, l thought you asked me to kick you This is a self-start bike. J for.. -Jug. Jug means.. jug. Don't you think our language is close to English? Yes, l think so. K for.. - Kite. Kite mean.. - Kite. L for.. - Lover. Lover means.. - Milkman. Madam, the lover didn't come today? That reminds me, my buffalo fell ill today. She wasn't giving any milk. - Really. When l went to the dairy to get some milk.. ..my wife asked me to go to school. She said she would take milk from a lover. Then did she? Why didn't you come to school for three days? Yes The teacher isn't good. She gets angry at the drop of a hat. l had come to deregister my name. Sorry. l was a little harsh the other day. No, you weren't harsh. You just verbally abused me a little. l didn't verbally abuse you. l just said that you have less brains. This isn't rewarding either. By the way, l have sworn to increase my brains. l have spoken to a few people about it. l am really sorry. l do not like this. Please forget it. l memorized it with great difficulty. But if you insist, l shall forget it. So are we friends now? l forgave you, isn't that enough? Why do we need to be friends. The other day you told me that you wish to marry me. That is the thing of the past, madam. When the milk curdles overtime, it turns into cheese. And cheese is expensive. Now l have curdled.. ..hence l have become expensive. Now you won't be able to get hold of me. Son, didn't you settle the bill as yet. lt is settled. Everything is settled Okay then, bye. Bye. l said bye. A friendship with a Jat is an.. ..unbreakable bond. What say, madam? So what's my status now? ls it arrange marriage or.. "My heart has stopped beating for, it now belongs to you." "l love you more than my life." "My heart has stopped beating for, it now belongs to you." "l love you more than my life." "l always pray.." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "There shouldn't be even a breath's distance between us" "You should dwell in me and l should dwell in you" "There shouldn't be even a breath's distance between us" "You should dwell in me and l should dwell in you" "We should have just one shadow." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "You are my companion. You are my wealth." "You are my beloved from the previous life." "l am your companion. l am your wealth" "l am your beloved from the previous life." "l will be your beloved and love you forever." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." "When death beckons you, l should die instead." Brother, this was just a mischief between the girl and the boy. That's why the alliance didn't go through Please forgive me. Son, it is my daughter's mistake. Why are you apologizing? Guri, go inside and get anew towel. Let us perform the tradition. - There is no new towel in the house. - lt's okay, son. Then go and get a clean, washed towel. Go on. Don't worry. Try getting her married to him. l'll teach him a lesson. Son, you are about to begin a family life. You should stop being mischievous and concentrate on your work inflation is high And your expenses will increase after marriage. No matter how much the expenses increase, water is always free. What do you mean? Marriage means adjustment. And l will keep doing it. Earlier48 litres of milk turned into 50. Now 40 litres will turn into 50. Adjustment. Son, there are many expenses to consider when getting married. Will this much money be enough for you? Yes, l will manage. Just be ready to attend the wedding on Sunday. Later don't blame me that l didn't inform you. What are you saying? We will come even if you don't invite us You are like Baljeet for us, son. -Yes. Here, Jarnail. Rs 50,000. Let us know if you need more. Don't feel shy. Thank you, brother. - l will return it soon. - Not a problem. Bye. Stop. Stop. -Yes, sir? What's in these cans? Milk l have sold most of it. l have some left if you want it. Check it. - Okay, sir. What happened, sir? -l will tell you. Sir! l got it, sir. Look at this. -Give it here. What is this? You are carrying it around. Don't you know what it is? Opium. l swear on God, l don't know how.. You must have brought it. Or did the milk turn into opium? Arrest him. Take him to the police station. Okay, sir. - Take him along. Let's go. l.. Police has arrested Jarnail. What happened? - They found opium on him. - What nonsense! lf you don't believe me then go to the police station and check And you say you don't want to marry your daughter to a druggie. And the one whom you have found is a saint. Trust me, this drug doesn't belong to me. Someone has planted it. Jarnail, we thought you are a nice boy. Thank God, we learnt the truth before the wedding, Let's go, Aman. -Aman.. Trust me. l have been framed. Who will frame you? l don't know. But l am innocent. When the law states that you are innocent.. ..we will believe that you are innocent. Aman, didn't you hear me? Let's go. Aman! Aman! "You go away, and it gets difficult to breathe." "All the dreams that l had start to shatter." "You were the one in a million for me." "But you didn't value my feelings." "You were the one in a million for me." "But you didn't value my feelings." "You killed me and then asked me to stay alive." "You have given my eyes the reason to shed tears." "You have given my eyes the reason to shed tears." Jailer told me your story. l feel sorry for you When is Aman getting married? Her name's Aman, right? What will you gain by knowing that? The jailer asked me to ask you. lf he might be able to help.. Tomorrow. The jailer won't do anything. You only will have to do something. Run away from here. l am already very sad. Please leave me alone. l am telling the truth. l am.. l have dug a tunnel to escape. Let's flee tonight. You have tried to flee three times earlier as well, right? What happened? You turned your 6 months term into a two years term. No one refuses a free ride to anywhere. They say, "Why refuse it. We just have to sit." You are getting a readymade tunnel to escape from the jail.. And you are having attitude! Shame on you. l am running away. You can do that right away. Good that she is leaving you Stop. l wouldn't have offered you if you hadn't suffered like this. l know what it means to be away from a dear one. You will yearn for her like l yearn for my son .. ..if Aman gets married to someone else. - l won't. She cheated me. Tarseen, for God's sake, please leave me alone. Ok. Then get lost. l didn't come to you You have come to me. Listen to me, brother. Think about that girl as well. People proudly boost about their sons-in-law. "My son-in-law stays abroad." What will they tell about you? "My son-in-law stays in prison." Look, everyone has a reason. Only fortunate ones get love. Don't miss the chance. Why should l follow you? You have a habit of running away. lt's not a habit. l run away to meet my son. After my wife passed away, l am his mother as well as his father. 'l had a small business of toys' Here you go. Thank you Bye good. Toys on sale! There are dolls with hair and monkeys with bells.. .. keep them safe from kids, and you get 100 years' guarantee. Toys on sale! Bhuggu? What happened, son? No. Don't cry. Mr. Tarseen? -Yes? You don't pay attention to your son. He is in the third grade and he still cannot Punjabi. This is wrong. You are in the third grade and you didn't even tell me. Well done, my boy. Well done. Scold him. He cannot read Punjabi. lt's okay if he cannot read Punjabi. But you should never scold him to study. But how will he succeed if he doesn't study? You know how educated am l? l have attended first grade, that too only for half the year. But l am running a successful toy business. l am very sex-full. Daddy, successful. You say that he doesn't know Punjabi. But he is so good in English. - Did she teach you that? - l have learnt it from television. School doesn't teach him. He learns from television. We are paying the fees for no good reason, son. Next time we will give the school fees to the cable operator. What can the children do if the parents are like this? Let the children do what they want, sister. But l know that l cannot see tears in this motherless child's eyes. He was crying when he was born. l slapped the midwife because of that. "No, l cannot see you cry." "No, l cannot see you.." Come on, sit in the shop. Daddy, how much do you love me? Less on Sundays and more on every other day. Why less on Sundays? Because of getting up late. - l get up at 6;00am. - l am talking about myself. Daddy, you will never stop loving me? lt's not a scheme that will come to an end, it's love. Don't leave him before you get Rs.5000. Do you understand? Watch out! -Are you hurt? Can't you see? How dare you slap a police officer! Can't you see? Why are you staring at me? l didn't appear out of thin air. You should have looked at the person before slapping him. He hit a child with his bike. You call him a person? How can he be a person? Okay, fine. You should apologize to the SHO Bheemchand, he hit him with his bike. He should apologize. And l will forgive him. He is done for. You have slapped the SHO. You will be in prison for around 5-6 months - Daddy.. - They are just blabbering, l have seen so many cops slapping people. But none of them was imprisoned. No, right? l too will come back. Like they scare to make the kids study.. They are scaring you. You should study. Okay. You didn't let his mother live in peace when she was alive. Now at least let him live in peace. Let him know the truth. Son, you should learn to live without your father. He will keep leaving you like this. Let's go. Where are you going? Take me along. Brother-in-law, l would not mind to trade places with you. Then do it. No, the judge will decide your term in prison. l will be staying here? How will he sleep without me? They will have to release me. My son cannot sleep without me. Forget about your son.. You just see how we give you sleepless nights. l slapped you, right? You should slap me in front of the kid. And our score will be settled. Settle down. l'll make sure you stay imprisoned for long. Daddy.. - Son, you got scared again. Whose son are you? Mr. Tarseen Lal's. That's it. So you don't need to feel scared. lt's just for today. l will be out tomorrow. You just drink milk and go to sleep on time. lf you feel restless.. ..you can ask your uncle to remove all the toys from the cycle. He will stand on a stool and remove them. You can play with all the toys. We will buy more toys to sell. Till the time you are done playing, l will out of here. 'l was sentenced six months' imprisonment for slapping the SHO.' Daddy! Give me a kiss. Come here. Daddy.. Yes, son? Now you will be staying here? Who told you that? Everyone is saying so. That they won't let you out of here now. No. There is no prison in the world that can keep your father locked in. He was out all these years, wasn't he? lf would have been inside if he was ever imprisoned. Why are you crying? Well, l have cold Stop lying. Your nose leaks when you have cold. My nose is blocked hence my eyes are watery. - Promise me that you will come out. - l promise. l will come out soon. Promise. 'l couldn't make a false promise to my son.' 'Hence l tried to escape from the prison.' - Catch him. - Let me go. My son is waiting for me. Let me go. Leave me. Let me go. Let me go. How must my son be surviving without me? l will get out of here. And if we get caught? Our term will be extended a little. A little? A little more. Look brother, if you don't flee, Aman will get married to someone else. And if you succeed in escaping, then you will have at least some hope. You might be able to stop her wedding. You need to decide. When are we escaping? We will get into action after moonrise. Tonight. Barracks are locked at night. You will break the lock with your slipper? From where did you get this? lf Tarseen Lal can dig a 30 foot long tunnel.. Then can't he make a 3 inch key? Made it with hard work. Not one but four. So many? There are four barracks. You never know which barrack is locked with which key. Hence, l made four keys. One would open my barrack and one would yours. So my brains work, doesn't it? Yes, it does lf you were in love, it wouldn't have. Yes l have always sold toys, brother. - l never played with them. Life has been.. - Gather here everyone. Hurry up. Come on. Jailer wants to talk to everyone. Come on. Respected prisoners.. We are grateful from the bottom of our hearts.. ..that you gather around after blowing just one whistle. My dear brothers, as you might or might not know.. ..that tomorrow is 13th April. And today is 12th April. You should have started from 1st April. We are not here to teach them how a calendar works. Get to the point. Coming to the point, like every year, this year as well.. ..we will be celebrating Vaisakhi in a grand scale. My dear brothers. Even if someone is dying at our respectable jailer's house.. ..he cannot breathe if he doesn't celebrate any festival with you. Hence, tomorrow, on the auspicious occasion of Vaisakhi.. ..our respectable jailor will.. ..present an entertainment program. l am just going to arrange it. l am not the one going to jump and dance on the stage. And what do you mean by entertainment? Sunny Leone is coming here? Ranjeet Bawa is going to perform. lnstead of entertainment program, say a cultural program. You don't even know how to make an announcement. Sir, then why don't you make the announcement? - Move back My dear imprisoned friends.. We very well know how important Vaisakhi is for Punjabis. Good news is that tomorrow on the occasion of Vaisakhi.. ..our local MLA Mr. Satpal Mandher.. ..will be joining us in our celebration. There more good news. On the occasion of Vaisakhi, he is going to give a big gift to all prisoners. Long live Jailer Jolawar Singh Johal. Long live Jailer Jolawar Singh Johal. Long live Jailer Jolawar Singh Johal. Glory to him! Glory to him! Pump it up! - Glory to him! l didn't hear you! -Glory to him! You are turning me into God now? What's the big gift you are talking about, Jailer? Have patience. Can't you wait for a day? My mother waited 21 years to have a child. 21 long years. This is how you make an announcement. Sir, l am not an announcer. l am a sub-inspector. And do l make announcements at the railway stations? "Jhelum express from Jammu will be arriving.." "..on platform number three instead of platform number seven." Prisoners don't fear us because of such behavior of yours. Please listen to me, sir. Why should l listen to you? -l.. Shut up. Who is it? Take a deep breath. We need to stop a vehicle. l too am eager to meet Bhuggu There's one coming, Stop it. Would you have died if you would have stopped? We won't be able to stop any vehicle like this One of us will have to lie on the road like a dead body. That's how any vehicle would stop. First, decide, do you want to go to meet your child or his mother. Someone might run you over instead of stopping. You hide, okay? Hide or they will think that you killed me. Shut up, only then will you look like a dead body. Keep straight your handle. Are you awake? -Yes Stay awake. l have given this cycle to in good faith. l won't break your trust in me. As soon as you break my trust, our bones will break lt's not going to happen. Still, if l nod off then let me know.. lf that happens then a truck driver will tell you. Or the newspaper headlines Ride it carefully. You killed a dog! -What happened? Not a dog? l am a human being! We are in deep shit. Can't you see a person sleeping on the road? Please forgive us, sir. lt was too dark so we couldn't see anything. Couldn't you put a light on your cycle? Light? Do you want us to install a generator on the cycle? You are asking us to put alight? We barely have enough money to pump air into one of the tyres. There are many who are ready to hurt a poor soul. But there are only a few who help the poor.

"The black thread got stuck in the latch.." "The brother-in-law fought with his brother's wife." "The white roosters crows in the courtyard." "The white roosters crows in the courtyard."

You still have six months of term left. l ran away. You escaped from prison? Didn't you feel ashamed? l felt ashamed hence l escaped at night. Bhuggu. Why did you have to escape from the prison? Couldn't you wait for another six months? You are getting angry as if you lost on interest.. ..because l broke the Fixed Deposit six months before term. Where is Bhuggu? Bhuggu! Daddy! You have grown taller. Bhuggu! Come here. Come. Daddy! Bhuggu! Bhuggu! Grandma, daddy! Don't worry, son. l am here. Why is my son scared of me? Because he knows that you are a bad man. Look son, he ran away from prison. Why did you run away from prison, daddy? Because of you, son. Let's go. No, l am not going with you Now l will stay with grandma and grandpa. Don't say such foolish things You want to stay with them? We don't even know when they will drop dead. Daddy, you ran away from prison. What if police arrests you when you get out of here? Then l will lose both, my father as well as my mother's father. What did you feed my son? He used to always chant my name. Because now he knows the truth about you. What truth does he know? Son, whatever l did, l did it for you. l ran away from prison for you. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Tarseen, you should leave or l will call the police. Call them. l am not scared. l have come here to take my son. l have the right to do so. Let's go, son. l think you should call the cops. Go ahead. Let it be. Don't involve the police in a family matter. Disconnect it. Disconnect it. l am ready to do whatever you want me to do, okay? But don't hate me. Daddy, l don't hate you. l hate your stupidity. lf you hadn't tried to escape from the prison 18 months ago.. ..then we would have been together today. Go away from here. Go away. Now l'll leave with you only after you are released from the prison. Bhuggu, listen to me. You have taught him all this nonsense. Your knees don't work but your brains work overtime. Leave or your mother-in-law will shut you up. Leave! -l won't leave. Leave or l will.. Disconnect it. Disconnect it. l have a small request. At least tell him to give me a hug. Why don't you tell him? How did you come out of prison? Through a tunnel. l cannot believe that you ran away from prison. Many in the prison won't believe it either. But l cannot help it. lt was very difficult to live without you. Now no one can separate us Neither your parents nor your brother nor anyone else. Police. They can. Hence, we will have to run away. Will you run away with me? Aman! Aman, where are you? Mummy! Come fast. Mummy! What happened? -What happened? What happened? Aman ran away. Oh God. Look at this. Sir, is here. Congratulations, sir. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. Thank you You finally got your favorite prisoners released. l think everyone read the Vaisakhi List printed in the newspaper? Yes, we read it, sir. Sir, you have proven that no one in the world.. ..can think about these prisoners like you do. There is no doubt in that, Bahadur Singh. The effects it took me to get them released.. Either l know about it or l only know about it. Even if l got everything done over the phone.. But still l busted my knees. Why are you whispering? One prays on his knees. Today l feel as if my kids have got a new lease of life. My mother must be feeling so proud of me. Your mother waited for me for21 years. What nonsense! Not you, she waited for me. You turn an emotional feeling into an adult feeling, Sorry, sir. Sorry. Did you inform the prisoners who are being pardoned? No, sir. This is like kissing a sleeping child. lt pleases neither the child nor his mother. Go and call Jarnail and Tarseen. l'll go and call them, sir. Sir, you have got pardon for your two favorite prisoners. But what they don't mend their ways after being released? As if there won't be another moonless night. We will arrest them again. Bahadur Singh. -Yes, sir. Have you made all the arrangements for the Vaisakhi function? Almost done, sir. - We need to sprinkle DTT.. - Why the DTT? Have we invited mosquitoes? We have invited the MLA. What else do you need to do? Sir, when MLA will felicitate you. ..there will be a shower of flowers. We need to just put that balloon up. Do l have to do that? l will do it, sir. - Then why haven't you already done it? So that it doesn't burst before time. Then we will have to put it up again. This is how much they respect me. They cannot put up another balloon worth two rupees. l doubt you will manage to give me 21-gun-salute after l die. Sir, it's not that. The balloon has flowers in it. They will scatter everywhere. lt won't be right for me to ask the prisoner to up your flowers Oh, shut up. l know my prisoners love me. But still, do talk to them on my behalf and tell them.. ..to give a huge round of applause when l am getting felicitated. Sir, l will go and tell them that right away. l'll cuss them if they refuse to applaud. There is something called as the fear of the police. You will never use that. You will always be ready to cuss them. Get lost from here. Sir. Brother, send less Punjabi newspapers from tomorrow. Nobody buys them. Did you read this news? Does a confectioner ever eat his owns sweets? There's news about your brother-in-law. What? He ran away again? No, the government is releasing him on Vaisakhi. Show it to me. Look at this. Tarsenlal son of Pyarelal will be released today. Brother-in-law is being released. -Yes Jailer Jolawar Singh Johal speaking, l am the PA of the prison minister, Jeeta. Mr. Garewal, order away. The minister's niece wants to interview.. ..the prisoners who are being released today. Strange. The one who is getting them released is not being recognized. This is like honoring the chorus leaving the singer Hans Raj Hans aside. Anyway, she is MLA's niece. l cannot say anything against her. Mr. Garewal, make sure that you and MLA sir reach on time. We have sprinkled DTT everywhere. But still we don't want the mosquitoes to arrive before the MLA. Fine. Bye. Sir.. Tarseen and Jarnail are missing. Do they have an upset stomach? No, l even checked the toilets l couldn't find them. Strange. America were able to found Laden in a foreign country.. And you guys cannot find Tarseen and Jarnail in our own prison. l am telling the truth, sir. l have searched the entire prison with a fine comb. Really? Check with the boys who have come to erect the tent. Some prisoners have a habit of sharing a smoke with outsiders. Okay, sir. Aman. l wanted to talk to the jailer on phone. What? Have you lost your mind? - You ran away from prison, Jarnail. - That's why. A nice man will suffer the consequences The least l can do is call and inform him why l did it. Hello? JJ speaking. Hello, sir. lt's me, Jarnail. Jarnail, where are you? l asked Ranjeet to go and get you. That idiot is making you talk over the phone. Sir, l want to talk to you. You can talk later. You have a lifetime left to talk First, let me talk. lt's more important. The good news l am about to give you. lt will make the ground below your feet move. - Sir, first listen to me.. - Let me finish. Government has pardoned Tarseen and your prison term. You two are going to being released at the Vaisakhi function. Damn..! Didn't l tell you that it will make the ground below your feet move? This has been possible because of Jailer.. ..Jolawar Singh Johal's personal pursuit. Now you tell me, what were you saying? Now what do l say, sir? Now if l say it, the ground below your feet will move. l am so happy that my feet aren't touching the ground. How much more do l have to lift my feet? Tell me whatever you want to say. Sir, l have already escaped from the prison. Oh no. When? From where? l mean how did you escape? Sir, Tarseen has dug a tunnel. And we managed to escape. Tarseen is with you? Yes. He won't dig a tunnel only for me, will he? You ruined everything l did. Sir, if you knew that we were being released.. ..then you should have informed us. l wanted to give you both a surprise. l didn't know that you two would shock me instead. This is like a girl eloping with the guy she was supposed to marry. Read the Vaisakhi List printed in today's newspaper. The news of your release my great deed is printed on it. Now l will surely be felicitated. Sorry, sir. Sorry? l know how l showed them that you two have a good behavior.. ..and got your prison term pardoned. This is as if the child came out before the midwife could show her moves Your eagerness has doomed me. The seven-months ones couldn't wait for nine months.. They freed themselves before time. Sir, now tell me what should l do. Listen.. You are going to being released at the Vaisakhi function in the evening. l want you back in the prison before that, at any cost. Sir, we don't have the prisoners' uniform either. You don't have a uniform. l won't be left with one. For God's sake come in whatever state you can. You can even come in your knickers What are you saying, sir? You are reacting as if l've asked you to come without your knickers on. There are anyway 8-10 black knickers gang's members in this prison. Two more won't make a difference. Okay, sir. l am coming, What do you mean by "l"? Bring Tarseen with you. You can call him up and tell him. l am not getting my son married that l'll invite everyone personally. You will get him with you. Sir, he is not with me. l left him in his village. l don't know where he must have gone with his son by now. Oh God. They are going on holidays with their children. Here l will have to go on a permanent holiday. Sir.. if we cannot find him, at least let me get released with honor.. Why are you stopping me? -Very good. The stain on the uniform will be the same whether one prisoner escapes or two. Get this straight.. lf l get into trouble then l won't let you get released either. lf you want to come back to prison.. Then you'll have to come back with him. Jarnail.. What happened? Why do you look so sad? Vaisakhi List. On the occasion of Vaisakhi government has. This is what l was thinking about! For how long will we keep hiding! You ran away from prison for me. l respect you even more Jarnail. But l wanted you to be released with honor. - With honor. - l guess God heard you But what will we do now? What else. l'll have to go back to prison on time. That too with Tarseen. Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind, sir. l have asked all the prisoners to applaud in your honor. Now they will applaud when l will be humiliated. They should applaud whether in honor or in humiliation. Humiliated? What do you mean? - For God's sake, don't.. - Jai Hind, sir. Sir, l think Jarnail and Tarseen ran away from the prison. You don't have to think. lt is true. They have really escaped No, sir. Prisoners cannot escape. We have such tight security. Our security is tight? When our neighbors bang their head to the wall we yell.. "Keep it low, we can hear it." They dug a tunnel right under your nose and left.. ..but you all didn't even realize it. They dug a tunnel in the prison? Then what, should they have dug it on your house? That's strange. We didn't even come to know about it. No, sir. l heard strange noises. But l thought it is due to the new earthquakes that we are having. We will face an earthquake now. That too in all our lives. On lndra Richter Scale. Sir, what will we do now? What can we do, Tulsidas? They have done what they had to do. Now you should prepare to remove your uniforms and sit at home. lf you want to do something then keep your mouth shut. No one should know that they ran away. Sir, what do l do about what l told to the prisoners about applauding? You are still thinking about applauds! Stop them. They cannot be stopped l have cussed them.. l asked you to use police fear. Sir, if everyone feared the police.. ..then these two prisoners wouldn't have escaped. We had to cuss them. - Back off! Bhuggu! Tarseen? You still haven't left? Bhuggu, look at this. Chandigarh, 13thApril, this time Punjab Government.. ..has decided to pardon the remaining term of those prisoners.. ..who have been arrested for petit, insignificant crimes As per these orders, two prisoners from Bussi Pathana police station.. ..Jarnail Singh, son of Mr. Gurbax Singh and. ..Tarseen Lal, son of Bhairav Lal will be released today. My son has started reading! l went to prison for 18 months and my son learnt to read Punjabi. l'll happily spend the rest of my life in prison.. You should become a Doctor. Tarseen, only we know.. ..how we took care of this tearful child after you were arrested. Hence, we tried to keep him detached from you so that he doesn't suffer. Don't misunderstand us Coming! Son, l'll be right back. Daddy, l love you a lot. Sir, all the other prisoners are asking about.. ..Jarnail and Tarseen's whereabouts. Tulsidas, such words always add insult to injury. Anyway, forget about it. Tell me, did you find out where did they dig a tunnel? No. - Then find out. Okay, sir. Bahadur Singh. -Yes, sir? We will go and tell the prisoners.. ..that Tarseen and Jarnail are getting released today. Hence they are busy doing the paperwork. Okay. JJ sir? l am not as smart as you are. But if you permit, can l say something smart? Tell me. The problem is that we want both the prisoners.. ..two show up doing the Vaisakhi function? They will be here. - How? We will postpone the function for two days. Now are you even greater than the Nanak Shahi Calendar? Dimwit, Vaisakhi is usually celebrated on 13thApril. This isn't like Navratras that if you are unwell on the first day.. ..then you can fast on the ninth day. Sir, l told you l am not as smart as you are. Then why do you mess with me? Let's go. - Sir. Hello, sir. -Okay. Sir! Sir! Sir! You didn't recognize me. Recognize you? Do l owe you anything? Try to put some pressure. Pressure? Am l sitting in a toilet? Not down there, put some pressure on your brains. ln which barrack were you held? No, sir. l have come from outside, and not inside. l am Bheem, sir. - Bheem? Bahadur Singh. -Yes, sir? What kind of Mahabharata takes place these days? Sir, you didn't recognize me. Tarseen Lal, the one who you are about to release, l am his brother-in-law. l have come here to congratulate him. Can l meet him? Son, l would have but at the moment, they are bathing him. Bathing him? Sir, are you releasing him or hanging him? No, l mean he is having a bath, as it is his last day in prison. That's good, sir. Let me meet him for just two minutes, please. For God's sake, you can meet him in the evening. He will be going home at night. They he will be all yours You can do whatever you want to. Well, we have kept an entertainment show to celebrate his release. But l had a desire to meet him and offer him some sweets. But son, these four boxes will be consumed by the staff. Sir, you can keep these three boxes. Let me keep one box. l have purchased it from his favorite place. His favorite place? Yes, l know all his favorite places. When l used to come to meet him he used to say.. "Bheem, when l get out of prison, we will go there and have Samosas." "We will eat Jalebis from that place." "Bheem, we will go on road trips together." Sir, l know all his favorite places Bahadur Singh. -Yes, sir. Bheem knows all his favorite places. Yes, sir. - Should we cuss him? No, let's play. What, sir? Let's play. You mean.. You mean my.. ..brother-in-law ran away? What do l tell you, Bheem Singh? l have seen many sisters and daughters run away.. But here the brother-in-law ran away. No sir, it's not like that. Once my sister too had run away. Oh damn. Did she return or is she running cross-country? Sir, the one go runs towards God never come back. You mean your sister is dead? No. lf your sister is no more then to meet.. ..whose sister has your brother-in-law dug such along tunnel? He is laughing? Oh, he is crying. For God's sake go and talk to your brother-in-law.. ..that he should stop exploring the country and come back to prison. Otherwise, we are going to lose our jobs.. ..and he will be stuck here for another5 years No, sir. Please save my brother-in-law. Don't cry, my brother. The circumstances are such that even l feel like crying, But we cannot cry wearing this uniform. Control, Bahadur Singh. Control. Sorry, sir. Bheem Singh -Yes, sir. You said you know all the favorite places.. ..where your brother-in-law used to visit. Yes, sir. Then you should go to all those places.. And a very capable officer of our office will go with you. Sir, you should such duties to me as well. ldiot, l am talking about you only. Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. - You two have only four hour now. To save your brother-in-law and to save your job. Sir. What kind of a place is this? This is Sage Crow's Abode. This is where he used to come. Anyway, what better place to hide than this? Yes Sister, what is police doing over here? We had given their monthly share. Then he must be here to spend Let me go and check. Yes, sir? Call the sage. Many sages come here. Which one are you looking for? Which animal's name did you take? Crow. -Yes. Call Sage Crow. We peahens didn't get along with him. He gave him another place and got rid of him. Tell me, how can we help you? You cannot help me, sister. My house is already on rent. See where your sage crow kept pecking. Your brother-in-law is following such sages? Not just my brother-in-law, everyone is following sages these days. - You follow me. - Okay. Come on. Hello? JJ speaking. Hello, sir. lt's me, Jarnail. l have caught Tarseen Lal. Caught? -You caught him? l knew you would save me. l am proud of you. We are coming there. Please keep the gates up. Are you an escaper or the prison minister.. ..that you wish to enter through the main gate? There are huge cannon sized cameras in front of the gates. They can even count all mosquitoes lf tomorrow someone finds out that you had left this place.. What will you say? You had gone to get immunization against dengue? Then how will come inside? Come back through the same tunnel you left from. That's fine. Then we will come through that tunnel. Okay? Tell me. Sir, we found the tunnel. - Good. lt gets better, sir. We filled it with sand and filled it up permanently. - So that no one can escape again. - Tulsidas! Oh Tulsidas! Now what do l tell you! This is what was missing! You ruined everything. What do you mean? l mean we should keep a prayer meeting for all the prisoners.. ..who were hanged in this prison. Only then will our troubles come to an end. What's the new trouble we are facing now? The mother of the tunnel you just closed..! Those two fathers were supposed to get inside through that. lt's not a problem, sir. l will use 5-7 workers and dig it once again. Oh God. My mother must be feeling so embarrassed. "l waited 21 years for this animal?" "Being a jailer is getting tunnels dug in his prison." Then l think arranging a prayer meet for you would be perfect. Not me, for the prisoners! Sir, what do we do now? Do one thing. Don't do anything. ldiots, they had only one way to get inside and you have closed it. l've heard of prisoners planning schemes to get out of jail.. These are the first prisoners who will plan to get back inside. Now you will have to accept, my tunnel will come in handy again. Think about it. lf l hadn't dug the tunnel then how would we go back inside? lt's all thanks to you. lf you hadn't dug the tunnel, then we wouldn't have been in this mess. Right? You ungrateful being. Henceforth, l will never do good for anyone. - Oh God. - lt happened in 2009.. - Let's leave. l gave blood to a sick person in my locality. He wasn't grateful. He comes over every month to complain.. "Tarseen Lal, from the time l have taken your blood." "..l catch Malaria every month." Did l add mosquitoes in the blood for you? There's more! l go to Goddess's abode on foot. But l offer water to the one riding a mule. l also offer water to the mule. lt's okay. lt's a mule, but it is going to a holy place. When l greet the same person in Katra, he refuses to recognize me. Forget the person even the mule doesn't recognize me. Say, hail Goddess! Say it. Say.. Have you seen her anywhere? l too am looking for her. She is my sister. Where did you see her? Tell me, where did you see her? l saw her in the movie 'Sholay'. She is Neeru Bajwa. That movie had Hema Malini in it. We haven't come here to increase your general knowledge. We are here to find my sister. Don't dance in front of these dogs, Bholi! Why didn't you tell me? - Hey! How old are your parents? 50 years old? There is still time, you can get a new sister. But you'd better take care of that one. There are many songs made on sisters But no one lets the sisters live. "The flowers, the stars, everyone says so." "My sister is one in a million." Hello? Son, did you check with all her friends? l still need to visit a few of her friends Go and check then. lf we don't find her there then she must have.. ..gone to Bussi Pathana police station to meet him. l will call you up. Meet you there. Okay. l think he is crazy. Ramu, get the firecrackers out. - Okay, sir. - Look over there, what is he doing! Great. - l had suspected it when he was talking to himself. Let's go. Your sister got separated from her mother, right? l will unite your mother and sister. lf l start attacking you, your entire family will gather here. Get lost. Hey! Where are you going! You are only looking for your sister? l am also looking for your brother-in-law. We escaped We are trapped. Now we cannot keep Aman with us But where will l go now? There is a place where no one can find you. You can forget to take a few gifts.. ..but don't forget to keep the liquor in the car. Okay. - Go. Hello, uncle. - Hello. Jarnail, you? These arrangements? Baljeet is getting married. Can you call him? -Yes, of course. The wedding procession must be about to leave the groom's house. l don't understand, Balbir. What will we do? lf the wedding procession reaches here.. ..we will be humiliated in front of the villagers. l suggest we should call up and inform the groom's family. What do you say? Congratulations, brother. Jarnail, you? The problem was such that l had to run away from the prison. Aman is getting married today. Son, it's your father-in-law. Excuse me. Yes, daddy? Actually, Aman has left the house in the morning without informing us. She still hasn't returned, son. l have a request to make. Till we don't know where Aman is.. ..you should not leave the house with the wedding procession. Can you tell me why are we running away? This is the boy l was going to get married to. Baljeet? -Yes. He is my friend. You are eloping with your friend's babe? Excuse me for my language, sister-in-law? Both friends want to marry the same girl? This is a case of betrayal. But l don't understand who is betraying whom? No one is betraying anyone. l will talk to him. You won't dare to drive back there! l am about to get married to him today. He won't listen to you, Jarnail. Hey, he is all set to get married. What will you go there and say? "l am taking your bride with me, you can marry someone else?" Sir, MLA's niece is here to meet you. Tulsidas, you. Yes. -Why are you staring at me? Escort them inside. Look, there they are. Welcome. - Hello. l am Navdeep. She is my colleague, Mani. - Hello, sir. - Mani. That's a very small currency. Just kidding, Sit down please. Order me. l am sure you must have received a phone call from uncle's office. Even if l hadn't, l wouldn't have been able to get rid of you. l mean who can stop news reporters! Order me. Quickly call Jarnail and Tarseen. Then we will start the interview. What's the hurry? l will call them. But first let them dress up. They don't need to dress up. We have come to take their interview for the newspaper. No one has ever come here to find how they are doing,. ..and you have come here to take their interview. They are bound to be excited. Forget about them, even we are excited Actually, only a few people understand a cop's humor. You have come here for the first time. lt is my duty to serve you well. l should offer you some sweets. Tulsidas -Yes, sir. Go to a confectioner who is very far away from here.. ..and get piping hot Jalebis for them. Won't that take a lot of time? Please ask him to get them from somewhere close by. The shops close by don't give us things on credit. We used to order food 5-7 days a week.. And they stopped giving us credit. Tulsidas. -Yes, sir. You don't move from your place when girls come here. Get going now. Listen.. - Sir. Also get some wafers and Parle biscuits - Not Parle, it's Parle G. We cops never even address our father as "Ji". How are these Parle guys related to us? We will give the money and get the goods. Even if we take it on credit. Tulsidas! -Yes, sir! Take your time. - Make sure the Jalebis don't cool down. - Yes, sir! l'll send you to prison till the Jalebis arrive. l mean give you a tour of the prison. This is Bussi Pathana prison. This is the historical spot where Shaheed Bhagat Singh.. ..and Sardar Udham Singh used to usually sit. Sir, l have done masters in history. And as far as l have learnt these two martyrs never came to this prison. Miss, you might have forgotten to read a page or so. Let me give you insider's information. Englishmen.. They were devils in disguise. They always feared that if their friends find out that.. ..boththe revolutionaries are in this prison.. ..thenthey can get him released anyhow. Hence, they used to inform something else and keep them somewhere else. Sir, you are proving a history student wrong. Really? This means the government has been lying to me. l specially got myself transferred to this prison. l said, l don't mind if you pay me 5000 rupees less. ..but Jailer Jolawar Singh Johal will only serve this prison. Mr. Johal, your thoughts are amazing, But l pity your lQ level. l pity those whom l have been.. ..askingto bow before anon-historical spot since the past 19 years. Now will you let us meet Jarnail and Tarseen? Yes, of course. Why not? But first let me offer the Jalebis l ordered for you. l don't want them to become straight. Come on. That's our car. The thief is riding it. - Follow them. Let's go. Drive. - Let's go. Stop. Drive faster! Stop! Have patience. Stop. -This jeep's owners! Look behind! They are riding our jeep and wearing our clothes Wait we are coming. -Jarnail! l thought it was Baljeet and his men. But l guess people value the jeep more than the bride. Oh please? - Shut up. Nothing will happen to you. - Drive fast. There is no salt in the snacks. There is no sugar in the tea. Ask him to add more sugar. We don't have much time. Let's go and find my brother-in-law first. Will l drink bland tea till you don't find your brother-in-law? No.. - Brother-in-law! - Catch him! - Stop! Stop! - Come on, hurry up. Just one Jalebi? l avoid sweets What do you like to eat? l will order that. Actually we are dieting hence we don't eat. You are on dieting? This is not an age when you should diet.

What are you saying, Mr. Johal? Please! Call for Jarnail and Tarseen. Oh sure. Why not! Why not! Excuse me. Hello, JJ speaking. -Jai Hind, sir. Sir, l stayed hungry and thirsty and found Tarseen. Jarnail too is with him. Why are informing you? You can never hide a pregnancy from a midwife. l knew an hour ago that both the fishes are coming to prison. Sir, if you had received a call then you should've informed me as well. l would've to starve here. Bahadur Singh, you can tell me your complaints later. Try to understand Ok, sir. - Quickly get both the fishes here safe and sound Sir, we don't want to fish - Okay. Quickly get both of them here. Hold on. What do l do with the junior Bheem, sir? What can we do? He can do us no harm. Bring him along, He will hang around here. You should have told him that bulls are following them. Whom did you address as bulls? Not you sir, l was talking about that cop. Then what am l, a postman? No, sir. We have been addressing them as bulls since l was small? You are smaller than this as well? Forget about him, let's follow my brother-in-law. - Come. Come and get us - For God's sake, stop our jeep. Listen to us. Look they are speeding away. Get them. Move aside, we want to get that stolen jeep. - Stop the police jeep. Catch them! Stop! - Stop! - Brother-in-law! - Why are you fighting? Why is he stopping us? Get out! - Get out! - Let go of me, you idiot! - Okay. Move aside, we want to get that stolen jeep. Why do you want to get it, brother? Because l am a police officer. Nowadays there are many fake cops here. -Yes Show me our l-card. l-card. Your l-card is fine. Thank you. Now can you show me your l-card? But newspaper vendors don't have an l-card. He is talking to me. My l-card? -Yes - Wait, l will just show it to you. - Show it to me. l-card, l.. l think my kids took it to school by mistake. Fine. Now don't waste our time and let us go. How can l let you go? Who knows l make be a fake police officer. l believe that you are areal police officer. Please let us go now. One police officer should understand another. A relationship is a different issue. Mothers and daughters keeps their own accounts. You should check his l-card. Blind-faith is what gets you killed l will make you check my l-card today. Even if l have to send junior Bheem home. He is very strict. He doesn't let his wife enter the bedroom till.. ..he doesn't check his wife's marriage certificate. Mr. Johal, we need to report to our office. Please call them. Ms. Navdeep, l want your advice. l have a distant cousin. He has a child. l don't know whether it's a girl or a boy. Did the child complete high school? May be will complete it this year. The child will become a graduate in three years. l need your advice, if we make the child do post-graduation in journalism.. ..and make him or her a reporter just like you then how will it go? You don't know when he or she will become a graduate. You don't know when he or she will do a course in journalism. You don't know when he or she will become a reporter. You have two reporters sitting in front of you.. ..but you are not helping them with anything. Mr. Johal, if they are not here in five minutes.. ..then l will make a call to my uncle. Really? lf you had explained it to me so sweetly earlier.. ..then l would have made the arrangement long back. Strange. l will bring them right away. Right away.. Sorry, l forgot the baton. Ranjit Singh, what will we do if we really lose our uniform? What will we do? l have it planned. You think about yourself. l will work for you Sir. The girls are threatening me now. l don't know what to do. Sir, keep them busy in a conversation and kill time. ln the meanwhile, the prisoner will return. Tulsidas, what else should l talk about? l have gone way beyond my capacity. Sir, heed my advice, tell the truth to the girls.. ..andtake them into confidence. l myself have lost all the confidence. So how do l take them into confidence? l don't know how should l get Jarnail and Tarseen right away? One trouble follows the other. l don't know what will they return. Tulsidas -Yes, sir. The five prisoner who came here last month.. Who were charged for murder and sentenced life imprisonment.. Don't two of them have the same names Jarnail and Tarseen? They have the same name. That's it. The girls have said that they want to meet Jarnail and Tarseen. They didn't tell us that they want to meet Jarnail and Tarseen.. ..who are going to be released. Okay, so you are Jarnail and you are Tarseen. Tell me, you two are being released today, on Vaisakhi.. How do you feel? Lady, is this some new kind of third-degree? No, you are really being released. The government is pleased with your good behavior.. ..and hence has pardoned your prison term. How do you feel? Feel? l think the government has lost its mind. This is what we feel. We have come here for 14 years. You are mistaken. You haven't been imprisoned for 14 years The local MLA is her uncle. He has pardoned your prison term. What's today's date? 13thApril? 13thApril? And you are fooling us as if it is 1st April. Lady, if they joke with the feelings of the prisoners. ..then tell me how will we spend 14 years here? Forget about the pardoning of our sentence. You get us hanged. - That's it. We don't want to spend 14 years here. 14 years for what? Tell me that which law states that punishment for possessing .. ..2 kilos opium and slapping an officer.. ..will result in 14 years' imprisonment? They are so cruel. They have left a mark of their fingers on the face. The government is releasing them for good behavior? Let uncle come, l will tell him. Why did you slap that girl? We killed someone with such great difficulty. And she said that we were arrested for slapping someone. She is the MLA's niece. Who knows, she might be telling the truth? The truth? You got fooled by her? Tell me, in which country does the government pardons.. ..someone who has committed a murder in just one month? Such leaders need dangerous people like us. Someone who can do anything. Who knows, that MLA might have pardoned our sentence for a reason. You might be right. You can be right. Listen.. ..isn't it better to be MLA's henchman than rot in this prison? You are right. But you have slapped this girl. What if she informs her uncle and cancels our release? We suffered a bigger loss than slapping someone than killing someone. He slapped you? -Yes. How is that possible? They are very decent prisoners. They even seek respect from the senior prisoners every morning, They have a school like atmosphere in jail. How can he slap you? Do you think she is lying? Look at his fingers' mark on her face. - Oh no. Ms. Navdeep, please don't tell your uncle about this. He belongs to the other party. He will get angrier if he sees this symbol. What? - No. l know. lt is not their fault. lt is Salman Khan's fault. - How? He had once raised his hand on a reporter. Now everyone wants to copy him. Sir, MLA sir is here. Tulsidas, l am already worried And now you have come here with more worries. He is here before time. Come. Come here. -Sir. You should open the door sooner. lt looks bad if bigwigs open their own doors. Okay, sir. Sir, it's good that you came in a beacon less car. This is the trend these days in the political market. l only know about the family market. My wife wanted to go to her maternal house in a hurry. She took the beaconed car, otherwise l would have brought it. The opposition will object if they find out about it. They will say that you use official vehicle for personal purposes. Try reasoning it with your wife, sir. l understand that it would be easier to reason it .. with the opposition than my wife. Because there is no greater opposition than my wife. Let's go, sir. The devil and our death stand before us. Tulsidas. -Yes, sir. Send a few prisoners at the gate to welcome him. And gather the others in the barracks Sure, sir. -l think minister was thrown out of his house. Hello, sir. Welcome. Happy Vaisakhi. Happy Vaisakhi to you too, Jolawar Singh. See, l am releasing the two people you had recommended. Are you happy now? l am happy. But you don't look happy. Actually sir, l love the prisoners you are about to release so much. That now that they are about to leave, l am feeling emotional. Otherwise, it's not an issue. For how long will you be sad? Consider them to be your daughters. All daughters leave one day. Sir, if all daughters leave one by one then this place will look deserted. l will be left with only a few daughters who have life sentence. lf you are so sad then l will cancel their release. You can keep your daughters at home. Sir, you are talking about daughters.. ..here the status of the father is also not confirmed. That whether he will be leaving this place or not in the evening. What do you mean? Sir, l mean come home.. welcome. Sir, they are here to welcome you from a longtime. Hello. - Hello. How are all of you? Are you facing any problems? There is just one problem. Hot water is causing everyone's intestine to burn. Please arrange for a water cooler. But we had installed coolers last year. Those were air coolers, sir. They give cold air, right? -Yes. Then make them drink hot water and stand before them. The water will become cold on its own. l have noted it down. l also need to go to home for widows Begin the function quickly. Sir, we cannot start the function right away. -Why? Because they will have to share their feelings with you. They have been waiting for you since morning.. ..like sisters-in-law wait for their sister's husband. l mean they will get angry if they don't vent out. So sir, l request you to try to understand my helplessness. Uncle! l am your distant uncle. But that doesn't mean that you call out to me from a distance. Come here and talk to me. Let's go. How was the interview? That is what l wanted to talk to you about. - l have already told him. That our prisoners get angry sometimes. Please forgive them. Forgive them? How can l just forgive them? There were ill-mannered People are bound to get angry sometimes. Prisoners often become of irritable nature in prison. Let me calm them down before they get angry. Okay, leave only after they are released. Okay? Not the release, they will leave after they watch us getting ruined What? Oh sorry. l thought you were Tulsidas. Did you order flowers from outside to welcome the minister? l have ordered many things from outside. lt's on the way. You came 15 minutes early. Really? That's enough Dear prisoners. ..first of all let me wish you a very happy Vaisakhi. Jailer told me that all of you wanted to share your feelings with me. Speak without hesitation. Minister! -Stop! Hold on. Let them come here. Tell me. Sir, we apologize for our mistake. Please forgive us Look, it's human to err. What's the use of keeping someone who has mended his ways, here? You have accepted your mistake. l feel proud of you for that. Minister, you are not canceling the release scheduled today, right? Why would l cancel it? lnstead, l will do release them with my own hands So that it encourages the other prisoners. lf the government is releasing two prisoners today for good behavior.. Then in the near future, it can also release four more. Long live the minister! Long live the minister! Enough. Enough. Very good. They already began the function? They didn't even wait for the people who brought back the prisoners. l think l might be getting a promotion. But no one is even bothered about me. Jai Hind, sir. Thank God you are here. Sir, where are the two prisoners? That's what l was going to ask. Where are they? Sir, we saved them from the police and sent them here. Then where did they go? Couldn't you bring them along? Sir, we stopped on the way to a garland for brother-in-law. You needed to make sure that he is here. Only then will you be able to garland him. What happened, Jailer? Sir, we have brought a garland for you. What such a rush for this? lf it was late, you could have couriered it. l would have worn it at home. Come on, begin the function now. Sir, now that you are here, do us another favor. Plant a sapling with your own hands What is this plant a saplings issue? Actually, l just uprooted a few at home.. ..because they kept obstructing my path. Sir, does this mean you are against the 'Go Green' moment? What is that? This is a planting department, sir. Please don't issue statements without giving it any thought. Say a few words in favor of planting trees. And plant the sapling which you have uprooted in the morning. Really? l had heard about what you sow is what you shall reap. Today l have learnt that you will have to plant what you shall uproot. Okay, get the sapling, Bahadur Singh. - Sir. Get a sapling. A sapling? We don't have any sapling in prison. Uproot an old one and get it. Get just a sapling, anyhow. Let me see. Give way. You found it? Sir, l have brought a sapling, Where did you uproot it from? l have never seen it in prison. Sir, it was kept in your office, on the desk You idiot, it is fake. lt is made of plastic. Sir, no one will know it is of plastic. Look, l have hidden the roots with soil. People do makeup on top and he did it at bottom. Won't he find out from the fragrance? Sir, l have used an incense stick to give it fragrance. You can arrest me if anyone finds out that it is fake. - Oh shut up. Get it here. Get the sapling here quickly. Okay, sir. - Go. Give me. Get it here. Do you want to grow it in your hands? Here you go, sir. The plants of my country. Even an incense stick fails in front of their fragrance. Actually, he loves plants from when he was just a kid. Trust me, l saw the movie, Shaheed-e-Mohabat Boota Singh.. ..because l thought it is based on plants. But it's a pity that it was based on a person. Sir, please plant it. Come on. - We are getting late, right? - Yes, sir. Water it. Sir, this plant doesn't need any water. lt is waterproof. But if you insist then please. Dear prisoners, today l promise you. ..that before it becomes a tree, l will get half of you released Then all of them are bound to die here. Come on, let's begin the function. Let's go. Sir, l wanted do discuss something personal with you. Now what? There is a small request on behalf.. ..of the prisoner we are about to release. They said it would be better if you release them.. ..on 1st May Labor day instead of today, on Vaisakhi. Why? Both of them are wageworkers They relate more to the labor day than the harvest day. Jolawar Singh, official work doesn't follow such rules Sir, make an attempt. lt would be great. We will release devotes during Navratras. During Diwali we will release confectioners. And release dyers during Holi. Very good. Next you will say release all husbands on Karvachaut. They will see the moon and come back. Are you starting the function or should l leave? Sorry, sir. Actually, l think a lot about my prisoners But they don't think about me. Jarnail, Baljeet. Jarnail.. Are you asleep? Baljeet! l haven't stolen anything. l will talk to him. You should heed our advice, brother. My son has already lost his mother. Don't make him lose his father today. l will be right back. Listen.. listen to me, brother. Baljeet! You should feel ashamed. l had come to talk about this l don't want to hear any excuses You are playing with my honor. Shame on your friendship. Baljeet, l didn't know that Aman was getting married to you. Now you know, right? Yes, but.. She is the same girl l was engaged to. l would have been married to her if l hadn't gone to prison. But you didn't get married, right? That's what l am telling you. You didn't get married, right? Let Aman be where she is happy. And what about me? Everyone in the village knows that we are getting married today? People will talk for a few days and then forget about it. Aman loves me. Think about this what if even after you get married.. ..she won't be yours from her heart. l need to reach jail on time. Let me go, brother. Fine. Go. But Aman won't go with you. Aman will go with me. lf l had to send Aman with you.. ..then l would have sent her with you 18 months ago. What do you mean? l love Aman more than you. Tell me. You had gone to meet a girl. So did you fix the marriage? No. Things didn't work out. His proposal is cancelled. You like girl. You send marriage proposal. Aman is happy with Jarnail. But that didn't work out. Jarnail hadn't given his consent earlier. But now they have decided to get married That's why l had planted opium in one of your cans l got it, sir. What happened with Jarnail was bad lf you want, my proposal still stands. You betrayed me! Stop. You shouldn't fight. Brother, you will get hurt. You don't look good fighting like this for a girl. Get him. Coming, brother. The one who took the girl is going against just one. And four will beat the one who had nothing to do with this? Where is he? Leave me! Jarnail! Leave me. Leave her! -Jarnail! Let's go! Let's go! We will take care of him later! We need to reach the prison on time. Get in. They will leave! Keep driving! Don't stop. Stop! Where are you going? - l am right behind you Caught you! Now there's one guy behind us! Now there are two-three more behind us! Leave me! Keep holding, Don't let go. - No problem. l'll stop ahead. Brother, l don't even know him. l just took a lift from him. You guys are so stubborn. No one will ever try to go after your daughters - You.. - Damn you. There they are, uncle. -Yes Jarnail.. Hit them, uncle. Get him! My cycle! Move aside! Fulfill our demands. Fulfill our demands. Long live the workers' union! He took our banner with him! May his soul rest in peace. What happened to him? He owed a lot of money. He got a heart attack last night. Good, he got rid of the creditors. May his soul rest in peace! Stop! - Get him! May his soul rest in peace! - He took the dead body with him. - He stole our dead body! - He took the dead body with him. - Stop him! Catch him! He stole our dead body! Father, creditors never spare you. Look, they took his dead body with them. They will sell his kidneys and recover their money. Get down, l have goons following me. They will beat you up as well. Stop. Stop. Make him lie down. You are back. -Yes, brother. Please forgive me, you have to suffer a lot because of me. What are you saying? l will stand for you wherever you want me to. Just don't ask me to sit. Why? Keep driving. l'm fine. "After selling off everything.." "After settling all dues.." "All dues." "All dues." "After selling off everything.."

Dear prisoners, l would first like to give my best wishes for Vaisakhi. Now is the time everyone has been so eagerly waiting for. Prisoners being released before term completion. l would request our Jail minister Mr. Satpal Mundair.. ..to come on the stage and share his thoughts with these prisoners And begin with the process of the release. Mr. Satpal Mundair. Let's go, sir. lt is closed What kind of a tunnel did you dig that filled up immediately? Do l dig tunnels with guarantee on them? And this didn't close on its own. - Someone has ruined my hard work. - Now what? Dear prisoners, l don't know what to say. l don't know.. what to say. Oh sir.. l really don't know what to say. Now l have the speech in my hand. l mean now everything is in our hands. Now all of you can talk freely. l know it is very difficult to spend your life in prison. So our government will try to one by one release.. ..prisoners who have good behavior at the earliest. l feel sad that your husbands are not more. Your uncovered heads and white clothes haunt me. But don't worry, our government is with you. lf any of you wish to get married again.. ..then the government will find boys for you. Boys? After all, one man should help the other. l know you are very brave. l can see the queen of Jhansi in each of you l can see Mother Teresa. l can see PT Usha! God has blessed you with a boon.. ..of carrying a child in your womb for nine months. God has blessed you with this boon? l know this is not true for you. But brothers, please listen to me. Don't get me wrong, Whenever you are released and you go home. This is what you have to say to your mothers, sisters and daughters. ..on behalf of the government. No one will cry when this idiot minister will die. l wonder how people voted for him. He became a minister on companionate grounds What's that? Through sympathy quota. Like you got a job after your father died. My prisoner brothers, l won't take much of your time today. Even though l know that you have nothing else to do. Now, l would request the jailer to bring on stage.. ..the two prisoners who are getting released today. Jarnail Singh and Tarseen Lal. This won't work! Jarnail Singh and Tarseen Lal. Let us go, inspector. He is announcing our name. We are being released today. Which father of yours told you that you are being released? Not our father, that mother told us. Ask her. -Yes Did you hear that? He is announcing our names. Jarnail and Tarseen.. -Shut up! Do one thing, call me back when they come here. Get up. Respected Jail minister and my dear prisoners. Before everyone learns the truth.. ..l want to present my clean record to all of you. A few years ago there used to Ramayana play enactment in our prison. On the day when Laxman faints.. The prisoner who had become Hanuman.. ..made such a big jump to get the cure-all herb.. ..that even after Dussehra was celebrated he didn't come back. Then to correct the track record of our prison.. ..we decided that no matter what happens to Laxman.. ..the Hanuman won't leave the prison to go get the cure-all herb. Like the minister was saying, he doesn't know what to say.. l know what l have to say, but l don't know how to say it. ln 20 years of service, l have always tried not to stain this uniform. But it's as if as soon as l had a bath, the fly left a spot. How do l express my feelings and share my pain? ln the ending what it comes down to.. ..is that l loved these two prisoners like my own children. But these ungrateful beings treated me like a stepfather. My uniform doesn't allow it otherwise.. ..l would have cussed them so badly.. ..that their family would have begged me. "Here, settle it between yourselves." "You don't need to involve mothers and sisters into this." These sticks won't help. l have already tried it. We cannot jump across the wall using them. Everything is over. Nothing is over. We will jump. Jarnail, we will have to find some other way. Have you ever heard anyone making,. ..such a big jump with such a small stick? No, l haven't heard But l also haven't heard.. ..that a girl ran away with the boy ..she had refused to marry. But l also haven't heard that a father makes multiple attempts.. ..to flee from the prison in order to meet his son. And that even after every unsuccessful attempt, he doesn't give up. Did you give up? Tarseen Lal, we have done many firsts in our lives This wall which no one has ever been able to jump cross. We will be the first ones to do that as well. Your son has just learnt to read right? He will also learn to laugh, play and live. Without you. And you too get married to someone else and keep crying for me. lf we want to get out officially then we will have to go back inside. lt's upto you. Or your fear might kill your son's happiness. When the law states that you are innocent.. ..we will believe that you are innocent. Now l'll leave with you only after you are released from the prison. Risking my job, l did so many things to get the two of them released. But they have ruined my reputation. Hello. Well done, my boys. Today you saved Jailer Jolawar Singh Johal reputation from being ruined. Better late than never. Brothers, my mother must have not eagerly waited for me for 21 years.. ..as much as l eagerly waited for you in the past 4 hours Minister, they are so stubborn. Since morning they have been saying that.. ..they want to show their gymnastic skills to the minister. They want to put up an act. l tried talking them out of it. l told them; "Brothers, he is jail minister and not a sports minister." But they didn't budge. They did it. Yes ldiots, you ended up at his feet. A little misaim and you would have killed him. Anyway, now l would request our respectable minister Mr. Satpal Mundair.. ..to release these two prisoners on this festive occasion of Vaisakhi. A huge round of applause. l don't know what to say. Thank you - Thank you. l really don't know what to say. Our prisons are so full of talent. The prisoners performed a magnificent jump. What talent? The prisoners came inside from outside. The prisoners have to run to make a jump. There is no place to run in the prison. Hence, the prisoners run outside the prison, jumped and came inside. Very simple. The prisoners were not in the prison. They came at the last moment. Didn't you notice how scared the jailer was? What is the evidence? l will gather all the evidences you want. But we will be blamed. The jailer might have recommended them.. ..but we are the ones who passed the order. Try to understand - Why should l understand? l have kept smart people like you with me.. ..to understand and explain, Mr. Jeeta. l do my job, the rest will be handled by Jeeta. Let's go. Your father got released. Now will you come with me? Daddy. Please forgive me, son. We misunderstood you l should be the one apologizing. l too suspected your son unnecessarily. But then l had this doubt that if he had 2 kilos of opium with him.. ..he wouldn't have framed me with all of it. He would have consumed most of it. Forget it, son. All's well that ends well. -Yes. Right. But if your daughter had agreed to marry me at the first go.. ..then this would have ended two years ago. Let's go now or do you want us to marry in prison? Tell me. Sir, why did you lied to us and introduced us to the wrong prisoners? All's well that ends well. - What do you mean? - l mean forget about it. And if one lie can help someone settle down.. ..then that lie is greater than the truth. But you were you trying to settle down? My mother waited 21 years for a child and l for you. What? l mean how do l explain it to you? l have loved these prisoners a lot. But they took undue advantage of my love.. ..hence l have decided that l will take my wife's share of love.. ..back from these prisoners and give it to a deserving candidate. l didn't get you. lt has never been easy to marry an intelligent wife. That's why l like you Uncle! Such decisions are not made by uncles. Such decisions are made by our parents or us Why are you looking at her? ls she your mother? You Mr. Johal. -You Mrs. Johal.
