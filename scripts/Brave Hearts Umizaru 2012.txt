But for search-and-rescue... we have one organization that covers the whole nation. The Japan Coast Guard Special Rescue Team. Or "Special Ops." They are based out of the 3rd region's Haneda Airport facility. And boast the highest level rescue skills imaginable. They are 36 select members from 13,000 coast guard officers. Divided into 6 teams. They can respond to chemical and gas explosions. They're ready to roll out to any part of the country... to step into situations too hazardous... for even the most trained rescue divers. They face various hazards. Confront death on a regular basis. So they train constantly... building up stamina, mental strength... sharpening their judgment and acumen. They are trained for danger. In short, Special Ops are... the last line of defense in maritime rescue. "Japan Coast Guard Special Rescue Team" Water, clear! Taiyo Senzaki rolling out! Check residual pressure. Come and eat your wife's delicious cooking, Daisuke. Here, Mika. Thank you. Chow time, Taiyo. Munch munch. Take a seat. Your tank goes...? Off! Wow, Taiyo. Good call. Eat up, Mika. Yoshioka always does when he visits us. He tells me about it in his emails. "Today we celebrated Taiyo's birthday..." Or you and Kanna's 5th anniversary. He comes to forget how lonely he is without you. You sure look happy now. We're inseparable. Stop it. - Why? - It's embarrassing. Why's that embarrassing? Yeah, stop it you lovebirds. We're not doing anything? Excuse him, please. We're no slouches, either. Our second one's coming. That's right. You'll be a brother, Taiyo. A big brother. And future Coast Guard officer? Do it! Follow your dad! No, a boy's got to outdo his dad. What, like Prime Minister? No way! That's a bit much. - Think bigger. World leader. - The world? Darn right. President of the United States! Hold on. To be President of the U.S... He has to learn English! Right! Repeat, Taiyo! A... B... C! Stop it. He'll catch your stupidity. See not "Thee"! Stop! Look at him. I'm sorry, Kanna. For having a job not suited to raising kids. That's okay. I can't picture you in a desk job. Being a rescue diver is in your blood. I wonder when he'll understand... what his dad does. Well, you can't quit until he does. But be safe. Haneda Tokyo International Airport. With today's low pressure system... expect some extra turbulence up there. Make sure people are fastened in. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. C.A.? Yes, Mika's a C.A... cabin attendant. Really, Yoshioka? How'd you swing that? She's from Kagoshima. Lieutenant? Morning! - Where was I? - Kagoshima. Yes! Yoshioka was on a speed date. A friend brought her. We hit it off. And now they're both in Yokohama dating every morning. It's not a date. Way to go, Yoshioka! Senzaki. You two seem close. We're long time buddies, yes. This is where the cream of the crop gather. We may have partners, but we look after ourselves here. Of course. This isn't a frat house. Yamane. Senzaki may be older, but you're the veteran here. You should know better. Togawa! You too. Sorry, Sir. Vessel collision in Osaka Bay. Yoshioka. Tanker on fire and sinking. Container vessel crew in need of rescue. Region 5 divers on site. A 945-hectopascal typhoon is approaching Kyushu. Rough sea around Osaka Bay will sink the container ship. rescued 3 crew members. But the ship's leaking toluene. - Toluene? - Of all things. Tell me about toluene, Yoshioka? Flammable and toxic. 50 ppm max. Ready, special ops? Container vessel's on fire. Rescue units pulling back! Osaka Bay, 34 31 N, E135 10E Patrol ship Tosa pulling back. are still on board. Status unknown. starboard, lower deck! Damn. Special ops. Toluene leak confirmed. Entering from windward side. Shima and Senzaki, prepare descent with respirators! Vessel's listing severely. Can you handle it? Yes. No problem. Rope check! Carbine hook check! All clear! Be careful, Daisuke! Begin descent. Flammable gas reaction zero! Disengaging respirator! Commencing rescue! Disengaging respirator! You all right? We're Coast Guard! Shima! He's conscious! I'm going to ready him for winch up. You're safe now! Way to hang tough! Administering oxygen! You'll be all right! There's one more! I'm going! Too late! It's submerging. Rope check. Release safety! All clear! Wait, Senzaki! Senzaki! Stay there! Help me! All ships evacuate! Roger! This is Coast Guard 687. One diver and one survivor are in the sea! Prepare the sling! No sight of targets! Locate from above! Daisuke! Grab on! Grab the sling! We're too low! Daisuke! LAJ501 ETA to Kansai Airport scheduled for 18:30. Special Ops returning to Haneda are to stand by. Repeat. LAJ501 ETA to Kansai Airport scheduled for 18:30. Special Ops returning to Haneda are to stand by. I had to go when I saw there was another. It was reckless all the same. He was asking me for help. If I deem it too perilous, I don't go. Even if the target's a meter away. We're called to places that divers and rescue units can't touch. Make a judgment error, and there's no one to help. We're the end of the line. All the more reason for not quitting. I want to get everyone out. I see. Now I know why you wanted to join us at your age. The ferry accident 6 years ago. The oil rig 2 years ago. I hear you rescued the last survivors. Nice heroics. But ultimately... your team members had to rescue you. In my opinion... creating those circumstances signifies a failed mission. You made the same mistake today. Your groundless bravado endangered everyone. Listen close. Successful operations require skill and cool heads. If you keep this up, you'll just need rescuing again. If a colleague dies saving you, then what? Senzaki's looking pretty glum. Long time since we had a guy who wears his heart on his sleeve. You don't like him. This unit must consist of the agency's most special people. Special people, huh? You disagree? No, you're precisely right. That's you. But Senzaki may be special, too. I'd prefer not to be lumped with a guy who's risen on luck. Excuse me. It was heartbreaking... retreating when there were still people to be rescued. Hats off to you special ops. I watched what you did. While we stood helpless. We lost one. But you did all you could. It wouldn't have been like you to leave him. Are you returning to Haneda now? I'll be training there this weekend. Buy me dinner or something. Take care. Hattori. Don't be reckless. I'm no role model. You are to me. Kanna! Where's Taiyo? You okay, Taiyo? Are you hurt? He's fine now, but he cried like crazy at the hospital. He fell down some stairs? We were hit by a wave of people rushing down steps at a station. He was wrenched from my grip. Just surface cuts? Two stitches. But no internal damage. Thank God. You scared me. Forgive me. I'm just glad it wasn't serious. Right, Taiyo? You okay now, buddy? I didn't know what to do. The ambulance was slow in coming. Taiyo was bleeding and crying in pain. It must've been horrible. Holding him and waiting like that, I got to thinking. And feeling sorry for this one. What kind of world are we bringing another child into? I worry about all the things Taiyo will have to face. I mean, who views these times as full of hope and happiness? It's hard enough to look after oneself. It's nothing like when we were kids. Kanna. I guess I'm nervous about giving birth. The world is full of good things, too. It'll be all right. Don't worry. I can't trust those words from you. They're groundless. So what if they aren't? If our feelings are strong... Taiyo... let's go to bed. I'm returning noon tomorrow. I'll email you. Have a good day. Mika. We've been together 10 months now, mostly by email and phone, but... that's actually been good for deepening understanding. Yeah? So maybe we're ready to enter a new stage in our relationship. In short... We're here. This is your stop. I'll email you later, okay? See ya. Damn! I should've started sooner! Don't be an idiot. You know Mika's thinking it. - Marriage? - Of course! Women think a lot about it. They do? You're pathetic. Okay, I'll give you my sure-fire proposal line. Seriously? Look straight into Mika's eyes. And say, "Into you..." Not "I'm checking in." No way. I'm serious. Not a chance. Besides, that's your line. - You can borrow it. - Nuh-uh. Okay, then. Marry me. If yes... then bump me. That's awesome. It'll show her your passion. That's great! No, wait. What? Bump me seems a little macho. Really? - "Bump me, please"? - Too weak. Marry me. If yes... please give me a bump! Okay. Felt natural. Yes! Go with that! Thank you! Hold on! Here I come, Mika! You idiot! Stay there forever. Next! Shima and Senzaki! Senzaki and Yoshioka are working hard. Actually, Senzaki had been promoted to 10th Region Captain. And he declined for this? He's got a passion for saving people. My advice? Just your opinion. It's about Yoshioka. Yoshioka, huh? He's tried to propose to me many times. He Proposed? In a manner of speaking. That's great! Congratulations! Oh, excuse me. But I don't want to get married. You don't? Why not? What? Why not? I don't know. They get along so well. You're in my way. She must have her reasons. Like what? You think Mika likes somebody else? I said I don't know. What am I washing? I totally encouraged him. I'm all flustered, too. He's proposing to her now. This is fine. Are you sure? You're on duty tomorrow, right? Get to bed. Well, good night. Mika. I've something important to say. Can it wait till next time? It's pretty late. Okay! Will you marry me? If yes, please give me a bump! I can't right now. Can't we stay like we are now? Stay? But... I'm not interested in marriage. I don't want to get married. Why? I like my job. So keep your job. Even if I earn more? And the life of a Coast Guard officer's wife is full of worry. It's out of the question. Mika... my feelings for you are real. Yes, my pay is lower. And I'll cause you worry. But you won't regret it. I'll stake my life on making you happy. Marry me, Mika. I'm sorry. But I can't. You'd best find someone else. Thank you for flying with G-Wing Flight Mio, could you take 47D some hot coffee? Of course. Thank you. Finished? Not answering, huh? We'll be landing in just an hour. Very impressive... flying by yourself. I'm visiting my grandma in Chiba. You live in Sydney? Dad's work... No. 1 engine fire! Switch and pull! No. 1 engine fire checklist! Auto pilot's off! What's happened? Trouble in number 2! Losing hydro-pressure! A task force is assembling now. Aviation Bureau, local police. Tokyo Fire and Chiba Fire Departments. How much time's passed? Search-and-rescue satellite... reported it about 15 minutes ago. Engine and control trouble on G-Wing Flight 206. Tokyo Airport Division, Tokyo Aviation Bureau Rescue chief Shimokawa. From the Coast Guard? Make way. Coast Guard this way. Excuse me. Chief, this is Coast Guard Agency Rescue Chief Shimokawa. Isehara, Transport Ministry. Pleasure. The trouble is with G-Wing 206 from Sydney to Haneda. A 747-400. Jumbo jet carrying 346 passengers and crew. Jumbo. It lost 2 engines over the Izu Islands. And 3 hydraulic systems are down, making control difficult. Don't make me repeat myself! Just give me accurate info! Haneda Airport Chief Dogami. Flight 206 is way off course languishing over Izu. Pilots are controlling the vessel with ailerons and engine thrust. Trying to get back on course. G-Wing Flight 206 from Sydney is in serious trouble. Control is extremely tenuous. A crash landing is expected. We're to wait off of Haneda and prepare for the worst. How many aboard the plane? Captain Yamaji, have Team 3 board rubber rafts off Haneda. Team 2 will rendezvous with patrol boat Izu. What happened to Flight 206? Has it crashed? Where? It has not crashed! 206 is in flight. We'll have 206 land from the south on Runway C. We can minimize risk that way... due to the runway's length and proximity to Tokyo Bay. Shift other departures to Runway A. Close runways B and D and divert other landings. The Wind's blowing northeast around Haneda. Strong 18 to 20-knot crosswinds across Runway C. Very tough landing conditions for a crippled jumbo jet... with no hydraulics. And only right Wing engines working. It'll have to come in at an angle. But crosswinds could easily knock it off balance. In the worst case, it could crash away from the runway. Photos! Air Force photos over Miyake Island. Let's see. Engine 2 is gone! And this tear? Probably from the engine's impact. Not good. May have severed the hydro line. And it's still airborne? Right turn 30! Over-banking! More thrust! Can't! We're over ETT! Just do it! Tighten your seat belts, everyone! Hold your child tightly on your lap. Tighten your seat belts! The number you are calling is out of range... or is not turned on. Mika. Let's go. If we're called out... it means... the plane's in the water. Is Mika on that plane? It won't come to that. We won't be needed, right? Course not. It'll land safely and we'll be called back. We leave Yoshioka here. A rescue requires skill and cool heads. That's not possible with loved ones involved. I'll tell the captain. You cover his duties. Wait. He could see his girlfriend a mangled mess. Or perhaps not. People are saved in airplane crashes. We go in believing that. Or else why go in at all? How often must I tell you? You get too emotional. I'm coming along. Don't worry about me. I see why you're long-time buddies. Too alike. Shima... where are your feelings, then? I leave them at home. Mobilize all fire and rescue teams. Prepare for emergency landing on Runway C. All fire trucks stand by in case it crashes into surrounded buildings. G-Wing Flight 206 out of Sydney is facing engine trouble... and is approaching Haneda airport. All other flights have been diverted for the time being... with only Runway A open for takeoffs. Haneda Airport Runway C The Wind's strong. About 20 knots from the northeast. There it is! Please get in a crouch position. Follow the emergency card. Grab the seat firmly, head down. Let me tighten that for you. You're going to be fine. Keep your hand and forehead close to seat. Landing gear down! Flight 206 is in view! Can you see it? Altitude 500 feet! Wind speed still 20 knots. You sure you want to force a landing? Final decision's up to the pilot. If he thinks he can land it, we let him. Coming in for landing. Landing gear's not all out! Control balance. Captain, accelerate. It reads landing gear down. We can't trust that. What now? Confirming details. Await further instructions. Hungry? Donuts! Donuts, huh? Let's go find some. Airplane accident? Oh no. No word on a landing attempt. The plane carrying 346 passengers is still in flight circling. Word is they've less than The mood is very tense. Mika. No landing gear? The pilot, Muramatsu, says he's tried everything. My God. How do we land it? Remaining fuel? But can it fly that long? It'll have to be a belly landing. On the body? Right on the runway. It's a jumbo jet! With right landing... ...gear down? The fuselage will break up. There'll be huge casualties. That's not a "landing." It's a "crash"! You want them to fly until they runs out of gas? Everyone will perish if we don't bring it down! What if we land it in Tokyo Bay? We'll at least avoid a collision with buildings and fires. Maybe minimize casualties. A sea landing? Can it be done? In 2009... A US Airways flight did it on the Hudson River. Everyone was saved. Boats happened to be nearby. Even if successful, a jumbo would sink in 20 minutes. And plunge right to the bottom of the bay. We set the landing coordinates and wait there... commencing rescue immediately. Fire, police and Coast Guard divers could do it in 15 minutes. What other way is there to save those 346 people? Where do you propose? Someplace away from chemical plants. And away from any vessel paths. In a southwesterly direction. We need an aerial landmark. Here. The Umihotaru manmade island. We can mobilize rescue units there in an hour. We don't have an hour. No? It'll be too dark for a sufficient visual. The pilot must be able to see the water. It'll be suicide. Can't a rescue be set up sooner? We're out of options. A belly landing? Why not a sea landing? It would avoid buildings. That alternative was rejected. By the time we get rescue in place, it would be too dark. I see. Can't we do anything? We can continue to stand by. They've decided to land on Runway D. We're to prepare for the plane overrunning the strip. A one-mile perimeter northeast of Runway D. We're embarking now. Haneda Runway D... Captain. What Senzaki? Water visibility, right? You need to be prepared for fires in a runway belly landing. To minimize that... you'll need to use up as much fuel as possible. Understood. Hold on. Chief! Special ops on site. Talk directly to Chief Shimokawa. Shimokawa here. Senzaki here, Sir. Senzaki. How about building a runway for sea visibility? A runway? We light up the water. Guide lights visible from the air. Guide lights. Then we can delay Flight 206's landing. And have time to get a rescue in place. Daisuke. Is that possible? A jumbo needs 900 meters of approach lights. And 2 kilometers of runway lights. to place in the water, Senzaki. Flight 206 only has fuel to fly another hour. Is it possible? It was you who told me not to give up if there's even a glimmer of hope. Let us do this, Chief. We'll make it happen. A sea landing it is. Captain Muramtsu. If you'll make the lights, I agree that is our best hope. Let us land on water. Water landing! We land it on water! Senzaki, go build a runway. Sir! Gather all lighted buoys. I'll return to special ops base. Get all patrol boats to the landing point. And keep all other vessels out of the area. Police departments are at the Coast Guard's service. Thank you. We'll need your support. Assemble medics. Get data on past water landings. Jumbo in the water. Approach lights 900m in length, Runway lights 60 meters apart, That's about 200 lights. We don't have nearly enough. Borrow from fire, police and Self-Defense forces. The current is fast out there. It'll be hard to keep them aligned. Put anchors on all buoys. Patrol boats will lay them. We'll readjust the strays. But we're racing the clock. With today's current, the fishing will be good. Excuse me! Stay in port today! - Stay in port? - Please. Why? A jumbo jet is making an emergency water landing. A jumbo? Yes, a jumbo. This is the Coast Guard. All vessels must evacuate... Can't do it. This boat is anchored to this spot. The generator shorted. Can we see? We pull up the anchor and tug it in. There's no time. We've no choice. Assemble your crew. Here you go! Hurry! It's not enough! More buoys. Fire department equipment will be here in 5. Listen calmly. We'll be landing in Tokyo Bay. On water? Do your best to keep everyone calm. We can't have them panic. L3 understood. L4 understood. This is Captain Muramatsu. Due to a landing gear and control malfunction... a standard airport landing is not possible. On my decision, we will attempt to land on water in Tokyo Bay. Please remain calm. Please stay calm and listen. But this is no cause for despair. The Coast Guard will be waiting for us when we land. They've promised to rescue you all. And I promise to land this plane properly... and return you safely to your families. So please listen to the attendants and remain calm. Yoshioka! We fly in 5! I proposed to Mika, you know. She turned me down flat. Can't marry, she said. I see. But I want her to be happy. I need her to live and be happy, even without me. Yoshioka. Daisuke. Miracles happen, right? We'll save them all, right? We Will. We'll save them all. That's what those 346 passengers are expecting of us. L2 Buoy is off the line. Move it to mid-point of L1 and L3. Hooking up monitor! Chief, Chiba riot police have brought more waterproof lights. Special ops divers are planting them now. Any boats still in the area? Six, Sir. One with engine trouble. Get it moved. It won't budge. We won't make it. Don't give up. Again! Hold on, Taiyo. I'll make you something. Let me confirm this. G-Wing Flight 206 will be landing on water? Correct. What? The fate of the 346 on board are with the pilot and the Coast Guard. I see. Thank you. Your view, Mr. Aoki? It's a huge gamble. It has no precedent in Japan. Do you really believe this splash down can work? We've never even simulated this, Captain. Re-check engines 3,4 and fuel. The lights are all in place. We'll take up rescue posts. Heli's all yours. Thanks. We don't have enough boats to rescue everyone in 15 minutes. We don't? We'll make do with what we have. Listen to this, Captain. Kaiyomaru is heading your way. We're sending ours out, too. Private vessel radio. Boats are assembling. Boats at sea, make for Haneda. I'm taking my boat. This is the Hakuyo-maru, ready and able to assist, Sir. Captain, requests from civilian vessels! Daisuke. We're here to help. Tell us the coordinates. Send out any boat that floats! Let's get moving. Chiba 2 to Disaster HQ. Emergency shuttles ready from rescue station to area hospitals. Staff and vehicles are deployed and ready. Ibaraki Police providing support to the north bay. Chiba Nursing College offering help. Local hospital dispatching Interns arriving from Kanagawa Medical University. Come in, Command HQ! No. 2 First Aid Station, Chiba Central Pier Status on first aid stations! Almost there! Pull! Damn it! Let's finish this! As soon as 206 lands... rescue divers are to move in. But jet fuel may leak so the engine must be shut down. Police fire boats will be there. We can't take more than 2 minutes. Load emerging passengers onto the smaller boats. The unharmed on patrol boats, injured to Oi and Chiba wharfs. We'll need the help of private boats. Doctors and Red Cross will administer first aid at the wharfs. Ambulances for serious injuries. Chiba and Tokyo ER facilities are on standby. Police will carry injured if ambulances run short. First response is vital. Before that plane sinks, let's get all 346 on board out. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be landing soon. Brace for impact. Please follow the cabin attendants' directions. Take safety positions. Lower your heads to your laps. Do not inflate vests yet! Put away glasses, pens and any sharp objects. I loved our time together. I can't swim. Don't worry. Coast Guard divers will grab you. Coast Guard divers? They train very hard every day for just this sort of thing. Rescuing people is their specialty. Don't worry. How do you know? Because the man I love is one of them. Everyone will be saved. I promise you. Brace for landing! The police, fire departments, aviation bureau are all here. Flight 206 is about to land on water. At the helm of Flight 206 is Captain Muramatsu with 346 aboard. On site are the Coast Guard, Fire and Disaster Agency, metropolitan police. A plane with 346 people will drop right here. Even If it lands in one piece, we only have 20 minutes. Then it'll sink 60 meters to the bottom. That's out of our range of action. Make every second count! We don't have time for our usual triage. Start by saving those who can move. The injured come later. Roget Flight 206 captain Muramatsu requests rescue status update. Lights and rescue operations are in place. Surface conditions? Northwest winds 8 meters. Weakening slightly. Waves settling to about one meter. Visibility? Good. Hardly a swell. Obstacle vessels all removed. Private boats standing by for aid in rescue. Doctors are set up on the docks. They're all here to bring you in. Flight 206 is all that's on our minds. Just land that plane safely, Captain Muramatsu. Once you set it down on the sea... we will get you out. We will return all of you safely to your families. You're the one who suggested the lights, aren't you? What's your name? Senzaki. Thank you, Mr. Senzaki. You've given me courage. Next week... my wife's having our first child. It's taken us 10 years. I want to see him. My wife's due with our second, too. Is that right? Let's schedule a play date. Then I'd better make it home. Damn right, Captain. G-Wing Flight 206 will be landing on water in 3 minutes. Take off! We get them all... you hear? CAs take positions! Captain! We're not alone. We're all battling together. Pitch 10 degrees! Rate, shallow! Hold on! Flight 206 location confirmed. All units stand by! The plane's wavering! It's about to touch down! Mika. Stay down, get on the boat, remove heels. No baggage, check for fires. Inflate life vest by the door. Follow the person in front, remove heels. Remove pointy objects. You can do it! Brace for impact! Heads down! Await signal to execute planned rescue. Mika! Move out! Landed on water. You've got 20 minutes! Attention all rescue units! Water landing confirmed! Move in on Flight 206, commence rescue now! Affirmative! Patrol ship Mutsu commencing rescue off right Wing. Heading to the middle exits off the starboard Wing. Fire outbreak spotted! Fire on Flight 206. Fire in engine 3! Extinguish fire! Ready! Lower me! Unbuckle your seat belts. Fire! No! Exit this way! Please stay calm! Unbuckle seat belts! Shunsuke! Shunsuke! Time to get out. No obstructions! Remove heels! Unit 5 divers descending onto fuselage. Tokyo and Chiba fire departments now coordinating response. Fire extinguishing efforts underway! Let's go! Stay calm! Don't rush! You all right? A passenger's stuck between seats. Please! Lend me a hand! Yoshioka! Let me through! Let's all pull. 1, 2, 3! Where are you, Senzaki? Left Wing! Cockpit door is jammed. Rescue from exterior! Roger! Please, help this passenger. Who, me? Anyone who can't move? You'd better hurry, too! Crew exits last. Now hurry! Anyone still back there? Is there anyone who can't move? Anyone who...? One overboard! You all right? You're safe now. Fissure in the fuselage center! It'll break in two! It'll sink! Hurry! Flight 206 is starting to sink. There's a tear down the middle. Airplane! Airplane! Mr. Terada. Rescue divers are outside the cockpit! Yes, Coast Guard special operatives. They're breaking the cockpit windshield. - They hope to enter from the window. - Daisuke. We have visual on the pilot and co-pilot! Opening the windshield! Heli, Roger. We're pulling up to stand by. Got it! Got engine cutter. Entering! Let's get you out! My leg. Pilot's leg is wedged in the console! I need an air saw and spreader! Air saw and spreader! He's bleeding! Applying tourniquet! Get the co-pilot out first! Get him out! We'll get you next, Captain. Anyone here? No more passengers up front! Okay, now the crew. Hurry! Forward evacuation complete except the cockpit. Heading to help out aft! Aft condition status! Sea water pouring in! Exit from the tail side remains. Still over 100 passengers to evacuate. They're panicking here. More rescuers! All ships, assist rescue at the tail. All ships that can carry passengers head for the tail. Where's she? Somebody... help! Help! Stay calm. Please stay calm. You'll be okay! Somebody, help! Help! Somebody! Co-pilot rescued! Pilot's leg is trapped under the console. Consciousness level 2U. to tear through the console. It's still going to take time to get everyone out. It's going to sink. Report on changes to fuselage angle. I'll get you out, Captain. Hang in there. Severed! Trade places! Spreader! Got it! Anyone here? Anyone left? Yoshioka. Mika! You hurt? - I'm fine. - Good. Yoshioka. I'll get you out, Mika, don't worry. Stay tough, Captain! That was a beautiful landing! You need to make it. You're having a kid! Is that you... Mr. Senzaki? You're going to be a dad! Let's get you home! Yoshioka. Yoshioka. Dammit! Yoshioka. I've been keeping a secret. I...I... Mika, just think about getting out of here. The fuselage is rising. It's going to sink. Special ops divers in yellow and black are trying to get him out. And the pilot's not out yet. That's right. Your daddy's in there. He's trying to help a person get out. Divers are still working desperately. Senzaki, get out! You guys go! I'm remaining! I'm getting you out, Captain. The plane has split. The front is sinking. Too late. Pull them out! They'll be sucked under! Hurry, Senzaki. You've got to go! Senzaki. Senzaki! I am not... giving up! You have to pull out! Pull out! Shima! Senzaki! Pulling out! Senzaki! Senzaki! Get out of there! Get out here Shima! Senzaki! Pull out! Pull out, please! Yoshioka. I gotcha now. Captain Muramatsu! Your family's waiting. Let's both go home. Everyone gets out alive. Masks and oxygen tanks! Get me and Senzaki tanks. Hurry it up! Yamane! Oxygen tanks! Tanks? Get out, Mika! Go! It's 60 meters deep here! If you get stuck in the sludge, it's over! We'll get out before that! What makes you so sure? Nothing! Shima. We have to save them all. Bring it down! Hook yourself up, Senzaki! Switch with me, Senzaki! Senzaki! They're not going to make it. It's sinking! Flight 206 has sunk. Still inside the cockpit... were rescue divers and the plane captain. I sure hope they got out. onto the helicopter. But not the others, unfortunately. Can you see that? It's the pilot! Captain Muramatsu! He's nodding. He's okay. He's been rescued. They're being raised onto a helicopter! His left leg is injured, but he is conscious. Mr. Muramatsu. Hurry with the back evacuation. Almost finished here. Mika! Watch out! Yoshioka! There it goes. It's sinking. Hurry! Yoshioka! Just go, Mika! Get out! No! Mika! Hurry and get out! Go Mika! Yoshioka! Hattori! Get her out of here, Hattori! No! Saving her comes first, Hattori! No! He's... he's my... Mika! We're not together anymore. Evacuate this civilian. Yoshioka! Go! Hurry! No, stop! Yoshioka! Yoshioka! Live a happy life, Mika. Yoshioka! Yoshioka's trapped in the cabin! Special ops' Yoshioka! Yoshioka of special ops is still on board! Yoshioka. Does he have a tank? No. Yoshioka!

Divers are gesturing a big "okay" circle with their arms! It's your dad. Way to go. We have just witnessed a miracle! Yoshioka! Yoshioka! Can I have a word with you guys? I'm sorry. Because of me... I'm so glad you're safe. I... have something I need to tell you. It's okay. My parents divorced when I was in high school. Ever since then... I stopped thinking of marriage as a happy thing. I swore to myself... I wouldn't end up like my parents. That's right. You are you. But I was wrong. I'm... a divorcee myself. You are? I married at 22...for 6 months. I couldn't make it work. I'm afraid. If you marry me... you'll surely regret it. That's why... Well, I'm sure. I'll make you happy. So you were married, no big deal. Let's look toward the future... together. All passengers have been confirmed safe! Yes! All! Chief Shimokawa. Great work. I never would've dreamed we'd get everyone back from that ordeal. You have my warmest gratitude. We just carried out our duties. The passengers of Flight 206 were saved... because everybody here pulled together. They all prayed that the 346 aboard would survive. And poured every effort into making that happen. That's how we got through this crisis. Everyone's feelings... caused a miracle. You're safe. I was so worried. It turned out just like you said. Everyone was saved. Yes. I thought you just had luck on your side. But that doesn't seem right. Shima. But still, most important to a rescue... I know. Skill and cool heads. And a little... this. Taiyo pointed to you on TV and said "Papa." He figured out what you do. He had the eyes of an adult. Really. Maybe there's hope. For this world. Of course, there is. People came together. There's lots to believe in. I feel safe to have another. Well, we're waiting for you. So come on. Want to know? Boy or girl. The doctor told you? No, don't tell me. Either's fine with me. As long as it's healthy. But you want to know. I do. Which is it? Well...
