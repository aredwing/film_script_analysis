Get moving. l've got tables that need clearing. Thank you. -Bill. -Hey. Terry. -Yeah! -Hey. You work here, huh? No, l'm just... You're just bussing a table in your free time? What do you want? Can we talk for a second? -Wow. So, how you been? -Fantastic. -Cheese stick? -No. Can l ask you a... Kind of a sensitive... Are you drinking? -Hey, come on, man. What is this? -l don't know if you've heard this, but l'm kind of the principal over at Plainview now, so... Wow. Congratulations. That sounds really boring. Okay, before l change my mind, do you want to coach basketball for us? Wow. Yeah. That's... -Yeah. -l can't believe Buller would leave his team. He's built such a good program with those boys. No, no, no. l want you to coach girls' varsity. No, hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, we got a great team. You gotta see them, okay? They're fantastic. My daughter's on the team. Tamra. She's huge. Big as an ox. -She has huge hands, like her mom. -l don't know, Terry. That's... All right, look, you know how many hoops l had to jump through just to be able to offer you this job? All of them. l had to jump through all of them. l appreciate that, Terry, but l can't coach girls. Women hate me, you know that. Yeah. Okay, well, then just stay here and wash dishes and eat other people's food, and, you know, enjoy that. lt's not so bad, you know. Not a lot of responsibility. You're right. There's no responsibility. -Spreading the love around. -Can you hold that for two seconds? -l quit. -What? -You want to go out with me? -l'm married. All right, forget it. l'm taking Bobby with me. Who's Bobby? Excuse me. Sorry. l'm really sorry. Come on, Bobby, let's go. We're gonna get you out of here. Have a good meal. -You hear they finally hired a new coach? -Yeah? -Guess who it is. -Phil Jackson. -Bill Greaves. -Who's that? Remember that guy who used to coach boys' varsity over in Culver? No. Remember? His entire team quit right in the middle of sectional finals? So why'd they hire him? -He's probably the only guy they could get. -We should just quit right now. -Shut up, Mindy. You can't even play. -You shut up. Neither can you. l hear he has problems. His team made it to the sectional finals, okay? He must be good. -Hey. -You can go now. Lisa, are you kidding? What is your damage? Nothing. l just don't see why they all have to keep moving here. -You do realize you're black, right? -Obviously. Well, our dad says that if we didn't have illegal's to work the factories, the country's entire infrastructure would collapse. -Your dad sounds like a pussy. -He is. Hasn't our infrastructure already collapsed? -Hello. -Who are you talking to? -Who is she talking to? -No, l'm just at school. l don't know, some guy she met at Shoes Etc. Last weekend. -What guy? -He has a mustache. Gross! Why does she always go after guys with facial hair? -l know, right? It's so disgusting. -lt's like kissing your dad. Okay, you just take it to a whole other level. -That is really unnecessary. -Shut up. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 1989 Class Triple-A Indiana State Finals. Starting for the Plainview Chargers, number 21, Bill Greaves. -ls this girls' varsity? -Yeah. l'm Bill Greaves. l'm your new coach. Where's the JV squad? We don't have a JV squad. -This is it? -Yeah. Did Terry put you guys up to this? This is a joke, right? What is this, Terry? That's just six girls, man. Yeah, yeah. Those girls, they don't even look like they're in shape. Well, the girls' program, okay, it's not as in-depth as the boys' is. Jesus Christ, what program? That's just some bored-looking girls waiting for the tits to come in. Hey, now, come on. You know? My daughter's on that team. -One of those girls has a broken foot. -Yeah? Hey. We were just wondering if you're coming back to practice or not. No, not today, sweetheart. Go home, get some rest, and we'll start tomorrow. Tell everyone to go home and play with little kitties, okay? -Asshole. -Hey! Hey, mouth! -See? Girls. They hate me. -Yeah, it's not just girls. Hi. Sorry we're late. Hey. Hey, how's it going, kiddo? How you doing? -Good. -Good to see you. Can we talk for a minute? -Yeah. What do you want? -l got your message. -Yeah, thanks for calling me back. -Don't drunk-dial our daughter. l'm not drunk-dialing our daughter. l'm coaching basketball again. l wanted to tell her that, okay? -No, we're really happy for you. Yeah. -Yeah? Why didn't you call me back? -l had a crazy week. -You don't get 10 minutes to call me back? Look, l gotta go. Make sure she studies for her algebra test. -That'll be fun. -She's barely passing. You could help her if you wanted. -What do l know about algebra? -More than me. -Bye, Mom. -Bye, sweetheart. l'll call you. Don't believe her. -She doesn't call people back. -Hey. Beautiful. Beautiful. All right! You watching this? Shit. Shit. Hey, get off your phone. Talk to me. What's new? -l'm playing ball. -Basketball? Yeah. l made varsity. You made varsity? Van Hunt's, they got a really good team. What position? -Shooting guard. -Shooting guard. -You a starter? -No. -How's your ball handling coming along? -lt's fine. You know, you really limit yourself when you only drive to the right. We should go over to Woodlawn tomorrow, see how you're coming along. -l can give you some things to try. -Yeah, l already have a coach. Doesn't't mean we can't shoot around. Mom really wants me to study for algebra, so... You know, just 'cause your mom hates me doesn't mean you have to. She doesn't hate you. She feels sorry for you. She feels sorry for me? She says you're the loneliest man she's ever met. Yeah, well, l never felt more lonely than when l was with her, so... You know, you really shouldn't say things like that. It makes me feel weird. -Eat your sandwich. -Okay. How many minutes do you get on that? Wow. So, like, l could take your picture like that? That's great. That's neat-o. All right, everybody, put your balls away. Hustle up. Line up on the baseline. You guys know what a baseline is? -Hi. -Hi. -What's your... What do you do here? -l don't know. Why don't you go play in traffic? Get out of here. Jerk. -Wow. -l hear you think we're losers. ls that true? Did you say that? Yeah. What's the point? Why practice if our coach thinks we suck? l don't know. Prove me wrong. When l blow on this whistle, l want you to sprint down court towards the other baseline. Every time you hear the whistle, l want you to change direction. You touch a baseline, you can stop running. Everybody get that? -What an asshole. -l bet he has a small penis. Why would you say that? Because men with small penises always treat women badly. -Who told you that? -My mom. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Damon just walked in, you guys. He looks so cute in his jacket. -Just go talk to him. -And say what? -''Hello.'' -Are you kidding? -l mean, that's just so obvious. -This is pathetic. -Wait, what are you doing? -Oh, my God. -She's not going over there. -Yes, she is. l can't even look. Is she talking to him or his friend? -Oh, my God, she's kissing him. -No, shut up. Okay, l'm not listening to you. Thank you. ls she... -He wants to talk to you. -What? What did you say to him? Don't be a freak. He's waiting. -Go. -Go. You have to go. What did you say to him? -l just asked if l could borrow his ketchup. -Oh, no. -Hey, Damon. -Hey. -How's it going? -lt's all right. You hungry? -No, no, l'm okay, thanks. -Do you want to go sit in my car? -Sure. -All right. -Do you like music? -Yeah, l love music. This is cool. -Yeah? You like it? -Sure. -l could make you a copy if you want. -Really? -Hey, what are you doing? -l'm done. -You're not done. Who says you're done? -lf she's done, l'm done. Put that away. Keep jumping. No cell phones. Keep jumping. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, buttercup! Keep jumping! Defense! Slide, slide, slide! Open. Slide, slide, slide! Open. -Defense! -Defense! -No, l said, ''Defense!'' -Defense! Slide. -Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide! -Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide! -Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide! -Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide! Check! -Block! -Block! All right. That's all you got? Yeah. Now you're ready to pick up the ball. Lisa! Ball! Ball, ball, ball! Over here! Over here! What, are you blind? l'm open! Yo! What's going on? Is there a reason you're not passing it to her? All right, look, l don't know what shit you girls have between each other. l don't give a shit. l've got enough shit in my own life. l've got a whole universe of shit. l don't need any more of your shit, so just keep your shirt off the court, okay? You can't start drawing lines here. Even if we did, you'd already be on the wrong side anyways. -What do you mean? -Listen, l hate to tell you this, but aside from Billie Jean King and figure skaters, nobody considers girls real athletes, so... -Who's Billie Jean King? -She's a golfer. And that's not true. There are lots of people who like girls' basketball. Yeah? When's the last time you saw a girls' basketball game -playing in a sports bar? -l can't go to sports bars. Hey, look, if it makes you feel any better, we're all on the wrong side. l mean, the game really belongs to the blacks, so... -The men. -You're an asshole. Big asshole. What'd you say? -l said you're an asshole. -l'm an asshole? -Yeah. -Yes. Hey, let me tell you something. What you girls know about basketball could fit in a thimble. Now, l can help you with basketball, and believe me, you girls need help, but l can't do dick about anything else. You want to complain about how unfair that is, l can just leave right now. You want to play basketball, l can teach you how to do that. Why don't you come get me when you decide what you want to do? You're not allowed to smoke in here. Okay, look. l'm just gonna be honest with you. -l live with my grandmother. -Yeah? She watches Jeopardy every night and goes to bed at 8:OO. -So? -l need something to do. We all do. So, you're gonna keep playing or what? What? No. Everyone wants to quit. l can get them to change their minds. Who says l want them to change their minds? -Come on. -So do it. Change their minds. Spit it out, sister. What do you want? You just have to do something for me. -Okay. -Oh, my God. lt's not my fault, it's the car. The car is just, like... Okay, easy on the speed bumps. -l've got a hangover, okay? -Sorry. Sorry. Why hasn't anyone taught you how to drive? -l don't know. -Signal. Signal. Well, where are your parents? Aren't they around at all? They're around somewhere, just not around me. What about your grandmother? l mean, why doesn't she teach you how to drive? Do you think l want to learn how to drive like an old lady? Yeah, well, you're kind of driving like an old lady right now. -For God's... -l'm sorry. l'm sorry. -Okay, l think l need a break. -Should l stop? Okay, no... Jesus. -Can l go? -Yeah. Why don't you take me to the hospital, 'cause l've got whiplash. -That is great! That is hot! -That is great! That is hot! -Come on, Huskers, make that shot! -Come on, Huskers, make that shot! -Go, Huskers! -Go, Huskers! Bill? Bill Greaves? Derek Springer. We played against each other in high school. l'm sorry. l'm drawing a blank. l played for Prairie Hill. l was a grade beneath you. Okay. You want an autograph or something? lt's nice to see you. It's good to see you. So l hear you're a busboy now. -What did you say? -l heard you're a busboy now. Yeah, l heard you were a girls' basketball coach. -Good luck. -Don't need it. All right! Let's play some hoops! H-O-O-P! Hoop! -Plainview Chargers! -Where's your boyfriend? -lt's a long drive. -Yeah. Too long for Damon. All right. All right. Hey, huddle up. Now, look. Come on. That means make a half circle. Let's go. All right. You know, a lot of people say winning doesn't matter. l'm not one of those people. l think it does. l think it matters a lot. in fact, l think it's the only thing in this life that matters at all and the people who say it doesn't are just assholes, plain and simple. The losers in life are always forgotten. There's absolutely no reason to play unless you're playing to win. You understand? -Fight! Fight! Fight! Kill! -Fight! Fight! Fight! Kill! All right. What are you waiting for? Let's go. Shouldn't we do something or say something? -Like what? -Like something like that? Yeah. Okay. Okay. ''Go, fight, win'' on three. One, two, three. -Go, fight, win. -Go, fight, go, fight! Let's do it. You guys are great. Bill. You can't say ''A-holes.'' -You can't say the A word. -What do you mean? -Can't say the A word. Yeah. Yeah. -Did l say that? A-hole? When? in the thing. In the huddle. -Hey. -Hey. -l'm Trish. -Tamra. Give me some of that popcorn. lt's all right. -Come on! -l'm open! -Switch. -Lisa! -Tamra, l'm open! -Go, Tam-Tam! Tough luck. That's all right. Come on, guys, defense! Come on, D. Head's up on D. -Shouldn't you be trying to comfort them? -What? Shouldn't you be trying to make them feel better? l don't think there's anything that can make you feel better -after a game like that. -Sure there is. What is this? l liked that music. Yeah, so did they. -You like basketball? -No. All right, well, how'd you like to be my assistant? No. Okay, listen, l need some help. l don't know how to deal with all this girl shit. Fifty bucks a game. Fifty bucks? What? -There's no budget for that. -You're getting paid. Okay, l'll give you 10. Twenty. -Eleven. -Eleven? -Eleven. -Fifteen. And l get to use the gym to work out during practices. You work out? All right, we lost, and we lost bad. Now, part of that's my fault. l never coached girls' basketball before. Aside from my daughter's freshmen games, l never even watch girls' basketball. l didn't expect the other teams could be so much better. l just thought everyone would kind of suck. That's obviously not the case. We're behind. We need to catch up. We need to catch up fast, or we're not even gonna be able to lose our games with any dignity. You have a daughter? From now on, we're gonna run practices mornings and afternoons. From now on until the end of the season, l don't want you to think about anything but basketball. l don't even want you to dream about anything else. What about schoolwork? Yeah, all right, schoolwork. Basketball and schoolwork. We can't forget about our families. No, no, family's important. l'm not asking you to take me that literally. -What about global warming? -Excuse me? -The planet's dying. It's kind of a big deal. -Yeah, don't you care? All right, all right. l don't want you to think about anything but basketball, schoolwork... -What did you say? -Family. Families and global warming. Okay? Got it? l guess. l want you to treat these like they're your babies. ''Treat these like your babies'' is a sexist analogy. You should tell us to treat them like our pets. -You all right there, kid? Yes, darling? -Can we treat them like puppies? Like little Chihuahuas? l want to put them in my purse. -Well, yeah. That sounds great. -l know. Do you want a little puppy food, too, for the balls? -Yeah! -Yeah. Yeah. Just take them with you wherever you go, okay? , Home, out to eat, at the mall -when you're taking a dump. -But we'll look like idiots. No, you looked like idiots last night. You start taking this game a little more seriously and that will change. -Hey. -Hey. -What's going on? Where's Molly? -Molly's at Gracie's birthday party. -What? -Yeah. What are you talking about? It's my day. l tried to call you. You really need to get a cell phone. No, no, no, no. That's not how this is supposed to work, okay? -Okay, Bill, just sit down. -Yeah, let's sit down for a second. This is my day, Stacey, okay? l'm not gonna take less time than l already have, okay? You want to know why she feels uncomfortable around me? lt's because you never pick up the phone when l call. -You pit her against me. -No. Calm down. You're legally obligated -to tell me where she is. -l would think about that if l were you. Tell me where she is. Let's go. We're leaving. Let's get out of here. -Dad, what are you doing here? -Come on. We're leaving. Let's go. -No, l just... No, l just got here. -Let's go. What're you hanging out with him for? He's got bad form. Let's go. Let go of me! -Get in the car. -No! Get in the car. Get in the car right now. Get in the car right now. -Hey. Hey, is everything all right here? -Everything's fine. l'm her father. Molly... Hey, Molly. Come on, Molly. l'm sorry, okay? Molly? Okay, l'm gonna open the door. Molly, l'm opening the door, all right? -Hey. -Hey. l need some help. Molly ran... She took off. She ran down the fire escape -and l don't know where she is. -No, she's okay. God damn it. l was worried sick about you, young lady. -l was worried sick about you. -Look, you go home. You don't want to push it. -She's really emotional... -Let me talk to her. Don't come in my house. -Hey, hey, hey. -She doesn't want to talk to you. -Here we go. Mr. Right's here. -ls everything okay? ls everything okay with you? -We're fine here. -Hey, get out of here, will you? Please. -You're getting out of line. -Yeah? -You okay? -Yeah, l'm fine. All right. l'm right over here. Look at me. -Come out here. l want to talk to you. -Billy, look at me. -Let me just talk to her, okay? -She wants me to call the cops. She wants me to get a restraining order. -What? What is she talking about? -Listen. You embarrassed her. Molly, come on. Let me talk to you for a sec. You should go home. Molly, come... What are you willing to do to win this game? -Anything? -Anything, huh? Gee. Would you follow her? Come here. Go ahead, now, push me. -No balance, right? -No. l want you to set a wide base. l want you to keep low on that defense, you understand? Get your arm out. Be the boss! This is our house. And you're the home team. 'Cause we got a whole crowd of people out there waiting to see what's gonna happen. They didn't come in here to see us... See you guys have fun, or get along as a team, or any of that other bullshit. They came to see their school kick ass! That's the only thing that's gonna make them want to come back, so let's get out there and let's give them what they want, all right? Whose house is it? -Our house? -Whose house? -Our house. -Our house. Whose house? -Our house! -Our house! l can't hear you! Whose house? -Our house! -Our house! -Whose house? -Our house! -Whose house? -Our house! That's right! Is there anything you'd like to add? Donna? Would you like to say something? You know, l remember when l was a girl, my father, he would take me out to shoot hoops, and l wasn't very good at it, but he always said to me, ''Donna, l think you should stop playing basketball...'' Okay, that's enough. That's good. That's good. That's good. Let's go. Let's get out there. Let's go! Nice. -Tamra! Tamra! Tamra! -Chargers! -l brought this for you. -What is it? lt's a burrito. l thought you could document our downfall. Abbie, l'm open. Get back! l'm open! She's open! Give it to her! -Lisa! -Give it to her! She's open! Give it to her! What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? What are you thinking? -Tamra. -Tamra, post up! Timeout. Timeout. Timeout. Timeout. Come on, come on. What are you guys doing out there? What are you doing? Tamra, you got to stay tight on that big girl under the bucket. Come on! -She's scoring all the points for her team. -What do you mean, ''big girl''? -What? -Do you mean fat? Are you calling her fat? Look, just because someone's big, it doesn't mean they're fat. Okay, l didn't say she was fat. No, but you called her big. It's the same thing. Jesus Christ, who gives a shit? See, that's the attitude that causes girls to have eating disorders. -Yeah. -Yeah. -What do you want me to call her? -Her name is Cindy. Why don't you try that? -Okay, fine. -Good. Can you stay tight on Cindy? -ls that okay with you? -Yeah. -ls that okay with you guys? -Yeah. Thanks. -Yeah. -Thank you. She can't shoot from outside, so let's make them shoot it outside, okay? -Okay. -Okay. Let's go. Chargers! Come on, team. Good hustle. Let's go, let's go! Pass it to Kathy! -l'm open! l'm open! -Kathy's open, pass it to her! Pass it! What's the matter with you? Kathy was open. At least it was close. -What is she doing here? -Just be nice, okay? -Hey. -Hey. Sit down. Thanks. So, where are you from anyway, Kathy? -Arizona. -Yeah? Why'd you move to Indiana? My mom and l were looking for a place with a little more racial hostility. And where's your dad? -California. -What's he doing there? He plays for the Lakers. -No, he doesn't. -Which one is he? The Mexican one. -Wait, which one's the Mexican one? -Shut up, Mindy. -You shut up. -l wasn't talking. -So? -You're so hopeless. l gotta go. ls that her little brother? Where were you tonight? We had our first home game, remember? -Shoot. -Did you forget or something? l'm really sorry, Abbie. Did you win? No. Well, l made you this mix. -You did? -Do you want to listen to it? -Sure. -All right. Thanks. -You're a good dancer. -Thank you. -Wow. -lt's so good! -lt is. -l think we should kiss. -Go, Warriors! -Go, Warriors! Get in position! Let's go! -l'm open. Tamra! -Let's go! Nice pass. Let's go. Good try. Foul! Come on! Come on, man! -lt's all right, Chargers. Let's go. -Get on them. Get on them! This isn't hockey. Where'd you find these girls? -Come on, Warriors.

Come on, Chargers! -Spic! -Don't miss, wetback. That's okay. That's okay. Hey, did you hear about the Mexican who went to college? -No. -Yeah, me neither. -Kathy, what're you doing? -What did you say to her? -Nothing. -Kathy. -l don't know what you're talking about. -Got something to say? -l didn't say anything. -Why don't you say it out loud -so l can hear you? -You must be hearing things. -Can you repeat that? -You have a hearing problem. Cause l can't hear you. -l didn't say anything. You're talking a lot of trash right now. You know that? Say it again. Go ahead! -Hey, hey. Hey, can you help me out? -You've got balls, right? -Can you help me out? -Say it again. Can you help me out with your player? What's going on? What happened? -They called her a spic! -They what? -They called her a spic! -Okay, that's just tactics. You can't listen to that shit. That's the oldest trick in the book. l heard your coach was a dishwasher. Beat her ass. -Right, you guys... Come on! -Shame on you. Guys, get off! Wendy, stop pulling her hair! Hey. What's up? Please don't make me go back out there, Coach. l'm not gonna make you go back out there, don't worry. l hate it here. Everyone's so frisking white. -Yeah. l know. -No offense. None taken. -You want to know something funny? -Yeah, l love funny shit. Tell me. l've never even been to Mexico. Probably wouldn't fit in there either. Listen, you know, kids are stupid. -Yeah, but it's not just the kids. -Well, you know, people are stupid. lt starts in childhood and then continues all the way to death. -l let everybody down. -No, you didn't. No, you didn't. l just walked out on a game. -Hey. -Sorry, you guys. -Yeah. Lisa punched someone in the face. -What? -Yeah. -Here Here. -Are you serious? -You all right? -Yeah, are you? -Yeah. -Did we forfeit? -lt got really rough out there. Yeah, we forfeited. And their spirits are down, so l think we need to... You need to do something for them. -You know... -Like what? We're gonna be passing places to eat. Maybe you could take them out for dinner. -l don't have any money. -You don't have any money? No, l can't take them. No. What am l gonna... Okay, l'll pay for it, but, you know, you're gonna have to pay me back. You should try dipping your French fries -in your milkshake. -Okay, that's disgusting. -l thought l was the only one who did that. -lt's really good. -You should try it. -Let me try that. How about an onion ring? -No, that's gross. -No, that is so disgusting. What, are you like... You got a rulebook or something? Tight on her, Abbie. All right, come on! Come on! Don't let her score. -Come on, keep it up! Keep it up! -Don't let her score! -Hands up! -Don't let her make that shot! All right, Chargers, let's go. -Come on, guys. -All right, come on! Get it back, girls. Get it back. That's what l'm talking about! Yeah! Abbie, foul. Foul. Stop the clock. -No, l'm not gonna foul her. No. -Stop the clock. -Come on! No! -Stop the clock! All right, that's good. Good. All right. Timeout, timeout. Bring it in, bring it in. You don't ever contradict me. lf l tell you to do something, you do it, you understand me? All right, when that girl misses her free throws, Abbie's gonna take the ball down court and look for the clear shot. Wendy, l want you to set a pick at the three-point line. Set it hard. Kathy's gonna cut off the screen and go backdoor, understand? -Go for the lay-up. Bring it in. -What about Wendy? What about Wendy? She's gonna be wide open on the three-point line. Yeah? Everybody's going to be expecting Kathy to take the last shot, so... Wendy can make it. l've seen her do it. -You can make it, right? -Yeah. Okay. Everybody's gonna be expecting Kathy to take the last shot. Wendy's gonna be free after she sets the pick. Abbie, you get the ball to her right away. Wendy, don't miss! -What if she does miss? -What? Well, what if she does? You just put more pressure on her. You should say, ''Try not to miss.'' -Something encouraging. -Tamra, shut up. You're gonna make it, you understand? All right, everybody bring it in. Let's go. ''Go, fight, win'' on three. One, two, three. -Go! Fight! Win! Yeah! -Go! Fight! Win! Let's go. Get out there. -Yeah! -All right. Box out, Tam-Tam! Go, Wendy. l know what you want. Come on. Go. lt's as easy as that! That's what l'm talking about. That's what l'm talking about. Yeah! -How do you girls feel right now? -Great! -Good. -Yeah? How'd you like to feel like that every day for the rest of the season? You played a good game tonight, but none of you played your best. -Are you kidding? -Hey, we just won. What more do you want? l want you to keep winning. lt's a good start. Let's go. Let's get in the locker room. That was good. Did you see your dad cheering for you? He was like... l don't think anyone at the game missed it, thank you very much. -And the red pants. -Hey. Hey. -Thanks. -Good game last night. How funny was Tamra's dad at the game last night? -He was so funny! -Tam-Tam, box out! Tam-Tam! -Okay, Chargers! -Go, Chargers! Hey, Bill, where you been? Game's about to start. -l can't... l can't do it. -What do you mean you can't do it? You see that girl on the Van Hunt team, number three? That's my daughter, and she hates me. She hasn't spoken to me in two weeks. l can't coach against her. What do you mean? You can't just leave. Come on. You gotta be a man. l can't do that to my daughter. She may be your daughter, but those are your girls out there. Go, Chargers! Go, Lisa! Go, Chargers! Go, Tam-Tam! Tamra, post up. Come on, girls, box out! Come on! Timeout. Timeout. -Are you okay, Coach? -Yeah, l'm... l mean, tell us what to do. Come on. We can win this. Okay, Molly, l want you to watch number three. -Molly? -Who's Molly? Abbie, l want you to watch number three. She can't go left, and you might be able to get a couple more turnovers, okay? -l want you two to set a trap, okay? -Are you sure you're okay? -Yeah. -You sure? Let's bring it in. -Go! Fight! Win! -Go! Fight! Win! Yeah! Go, Chargers! Let's go, girls. Here we go, Abbie. Keep it going, keep it going! Hey! -You apologize to that girl right now. -No! -You apologize to her right now! -Get lost! Stay out of this. Stay out of this. Don't make a scene, okay? Don't talk to me like that. You shut up! And you're a loser! l hate you! So, that was your daughter, right? Yeah. Yeah. What... What did you do to her? What did l do to her? -l mean, what... -l didn't do anything to her. Well, why does she hate you so much? Her mother brainwashed her. -What did you do to her mother? -Nothing. Well, we think you should take her to see a counselor or something. -ls that what you think? -Well, l think it would help. We don't need any help, okay? lt really helped me and my dad after our parents got divorced. -Yeah, it helped me and my dad, too. -Whatever. A therapist helped me stop confusing issues with my mom -with issues from my father's abandonment. -Jesus Christ! -ls everybody here from a broken home? -My parents are still together, Coach. But they hate each other. That's ridiculous. ...but l'll come back when you draw it. -Hey. -Hey. -You want some popcorn? -No. Thank you. -Can l ask you something? -Sure. Do you like women? -Who told you that? -No one. That's none of your business. l'm sorry. Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of if l did, either. When did you first know? l mean, if you did. Attraction is chemical. You feel something for someone, your body just lets you know. Sometimes before your mind accepts it. Why? -You think you might be... -l don't think so. -ls that Wendy's boyfriend? -Yeah. -l don't know what you're talking about. -What about the text you sent me? What about that text? -Hi, Coach. -Hey, Wendy. Who's your friend? Hey. Joel. Nice to meet you. -You know she's 16, right? -Seventeen, actually. -Yeah. Whatever. You're still too young. -Hey, it's not like that. Yeah? What's it like? You want to know, huh? Yeah. She's wearing a retainer. You know that. Stay off the sports drinks, Coach. -Stay away from my team. -Yeah, all right. You coming, Wendy? Move with the ball. That's good. Okay, drive it. Drive it at me. A bit. Nice. -You're late. -Yeah, well, l'm here now. We have a new addition. -Who the hell are you? -Her name is Floor. Can you speak English? Not really. Can she play? -Do cows say moo? -Great. Well, welcome to America. We'll get you a ball with your name on it. The girls want to talk to you about something. Yeah? What now? Keep the toilet seat down or something? The boys played their first home game Last night, and the girls thought that they were treated better. -Yeah. -lt's not fair. Well, life isn't fair. What can l say? Adapt or menstruate, right, Floor? The girls want to bust through a paper banner like the boys. -Yeah. -Yeah. And we want an announcer, too. And cheerleaders. Yeah, that stuff comes with winning games. We have been winning games. -You know, at least a couple, right? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah. l'll see what l can do. l'll jot it down on my to-do list. lt happens. Okay? Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! -What's he doing out there? -l don't know. Hey, Coach, are you okay? -Hey. -Are you okay? What happened? -Hey. -Can you help him up? -Come on. Do you need any help? -Did you fall? -l'm just trying to find my... Hey! -Jesus. Where's my hat? Yeah. l'm just trying to find my keys. -l'll help you. Are they in here? -What's wrong with him? -Here, can you stand up? -Thank you. -We got a lot of balls. -Those are our babies. -l will find my keys. -You know what? They are not in here, so l think that we'll just give you a ride home. Where's the light? Okay, come on in. Thanks, girls. You okay? What, did you have a party in here or something? Yeah, a big party. Let's have a party right now. Hey, put on some music. What was the occasion for this little party, Coach? What, you didn't hear? l won Asshole of the Year award. l didn't know they gave out an award for that. -Yeah, they got awards for everything now. -Let me guess. Is this the trophy? -Yeah. Isn't it gorgeous? -Were you any good in high school? -Are you kidding me? l was great. -Really? l led the only team in Plainview history to make it to State. Did you win? No. Then you couldn't have been that good, then. Sassy pants! -Somebody's a sassy pants. -Was my dad any good at basketball? He was good at putting on his jockstrap. ls this your wife? Ex. -She's pretty. -How'd you get her to marry you? What am l, a tuna fish sandwich? -What is that? -Coffee. -Have some. It'll make you feel better. -l don't want a coffee, l want a beer. -No. No more beer, Coach. -No, you don't need any more beer. Take it from him. Take it from him. So, what, were you guys high-school sweethearts? -Yeah, something like that. -What happened? Just... You know, high school ended, that's all. -Did you play ball in college? -No. Why not? -lt just didn't work out. -Well, where'd you go? lU. That's the man right there. -So, you couldn't make the team? -l could have made the team. l could have made the team plenty and then some. l just don't understand. l mean, if you could have made the team, well, why didn't you play? He had a kid. ls that true? Thanks for the ride, but l think it's time you should go. Maybe now. Well, we don't want to leave you by yourself. l think we'll just stay until maybe you want to, like, drink some water -and lie down? -Just go. -Are you sure? -Are you sure? Don't you want us to clean up or something, or help you out? -Just... Just go, please, okay? -No, we're not gonna leave. l don't think you're all right here by yourself. l'm fine, sweetheart. Come on, let's go. -We'll see you at practice, okay? -See you, Coach. -Are you sure you don't want us to stay? -Go. Hey, you can recycle these cans, you know. -Get out! -Okay, okay, Coach. -Fuck! Fuck. Jesus! -Good morning. What are you doing in here? l just thought l'd come by and say hello, you know? Haven't spoken much since you started, so... -Yeah, l've been busy. -The girls are really coming along, huh? Tamra can't stop talking about you. Yeah, she's good. They all are. They're doing a good job. -l know, l told you. -Yeah. Yeah. No, you're... -What's this? You rode your bike today? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. l lost my keys. -Yuck. -Yeah. So, you find them? Yeah, yeah, they were under the seat. Something... Something you want to say to me, or... -No. No. Guess not. -Okay. Okay. Just try and keep a hold of those keys, okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You got it, you got it. -Fuck it. -Hey. Listen, man. l'm just gonna say it. l think your assistant coach is a lesbian. -What? -Yeah. Boy, that feels better. -How do you... -l mean, l don't know. Don't, like, you know, quote me or anything. l'm just... l just got a sense. -The way she moves. -Yeah. Yeah. Her general demeanor. She drives a bus. -Yeah. -She wears very comfy sneakers. l'll check her out. l'll see... It's gonna be fine. -Okay. -Okay. -All right. -Weird. Great. Hey. -Hey, thanks... Thanks, man. -All right. Go, fight, win! All right, who wants to talk about what happened last night? Who wants to talk about why we lost to a team that was shorter, slower and less talented than us? Anyone? l see. Well, if we're not gonna talk, we might as well get a little running in. Hit the baseline. Where's your sister? -She's at Shoes Etc. -Shoes Etc.? Yeah. With that new guy. You know how beautiful l think you are? -Hey, party's over, shithead. Let's go. -Hey! -Let's go. -What are you doing here? Didn't l tell you she was 16? -l'm 17! -Whatever! -Coach, it's not what you think. -You have no idea what l think, okay? -Wendy, you're not going anywhere. -l'm sorry. Let's go. -You're having private practice, huh? -Shithead! -Oh, my... What are you doing? -Get out of my face, asshole. He's fine. l'm sure it happens to him all the time. Let's go. Let's go. -What is wrong with you? -l'm sure it happens to him every day. -Did you just throw a shoe at me? -No. No. No. l didn't throw anything at you. That wasn't me. Let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go. -You picked a real winner there. -What are you, jealous? No. -No, l'm not. -You are. -No. -You're jealous. You're totally jealous, you perv. l hate to bust your bubble, honey, but you're not my type. l'm moving! l'm moving! Go ahead! Go ahead! -What's your type? -l like big tits and an onion butt. What's an onion butt? lt's an ass that brings tears to your eyes. All right, everybody, gather around. This is last year Triple-A finals, okay? These girls are from schools just like this one. What's wrong? What are you laughing about? What is it? -Gross. -Shit. You guys are looking at my... All right. It's not funny. Here you go. Save me some of those pizza things. -Okay. -Excuse me. -Hello? Hey. Yeah. -l want you to watch this point guard. They're really good. You guys could be this good. Watch this defense. Keeping them outside, see? -They can't penetrate. See that? -They're really good. -What is she doing? -Wow! -Did she just take that? -What was that, a foul? Wde open underneath the bucket and... Rattled out of there! So are you gay, or do you got a fellow or what? That's not a very polite way of asking. l'm sorry. Are you a lesbian, or... -Does it matter? -Hey, l don't care. l'm just... You know, it's a small town. A lot of people would be uncomfortable knowing that somebody like you is hanging out with their teenage girls. -Do you think they're comfortable with you? -l'm not a... l've never known a gay before. -l don't know how this works. l mean... -Sure you have. They just didn't tell you. Okay. Since we're being so honest here, you mind if l ask you a question? l hope you're not gonna ask me to impregnate you, are you? That's cute. No. What happened with those boys at Culver? Someone said something they shouldn't have, something about my daughter, and l did something l shouldn't have. Just for saying something about your daughter? l lost control, and my players didn't back me up. Let's just leave it at that. Lisa, Kathy against Tamra, Wendy and Floor. Let's go. All right. What'd l tell you girls about putting this shit on my court? -No! -No! No! No! No! -That's not trash! -What is it? Barbie shit? What is it? That's not trash. Open it. -What is it? -Open it. That's very thoughtful of you. Thank you. We wanted to get you something. Okay, back to practice. Let's go. Come on. Let's go, come on. Thank you very much. l appreciate it. Hey, can l get a... Can l get a pack of Cool's? Menthol? They're minty. -What makes a guy turn into a jerk? -Why are you asking me that? -Look, do you know Damon Tisdale? -Yeah, the ugly guy? -Okay, he's not ugly. -Short kid? l know. He's a point guard. l know. He's good. We're kind of dating and, l don't know, he's never been to one of my games, -and l've been to all of his. -Well, you know, a kid like Damon Tisdale is not really thinking about the big picture right now, you know what l mean? No, l don't. l mean... l mean, you know, he's a star athlete. He's popular. He's got a pretty girlfriend. As far as he's concerned, the sun shines out of his ass. Well, okay, then, what is this big picture? Big picture is the rest of his life. That's the big picture. He's gonna be pumping gas in a few years. l don't know if that's supposed to make me feel better or worse. l don't even think he's that great a player, to be honest with you. Mop the tears up. Put your bras back on. Let's go. Stop talking about boys. Come on. We have a job to do. Bring it in, let's bring it in. Let's go. This is the last game of the season. Up until tonight, we've won some of our games, lost some of our games. This game determines whether or not we have a winning season or a losing season, and that determines if we get to go to the sectionals or not. You know what? -l don't really give a shit, because... -What? This has been a good one for me, and... So just go out there, and, you know, do the best you can. l mean, you know, try to win. -Are you drunk? -l'm not drunk at all. l'm serious. l want you to win. But don't think that that's not... Hey, wait a minute. Don't think that that's not important, not to win, okay? You know what l mean? Okay, l'm not... Yeah, hold on a second. Hold on, hold on. One, two, three! -Go! Fight! Win! -Go! Fight! Win! -Get back. Let's get back. -Go, Chargers! Come on, defense, girls. Tamra, box out! That's okay. That's okay. All right! Tam-Tam! Hey! What's up? What are you doing here? -Nice room. -Thank you. -ln your garage. -l know, isn't it cool? Yeah, we had our last game tonight. -We won, FYl. We're going to the sectionals. -That's great. What were you doing? l mean, l always make it to your games... -l know. -...and you've never even come to one yet. l... l forgot. Yeah. Look, Damon, l like you, you know. You're really cute. You're a good kisser. Thank you. Yeah, l like you, too. But l just don't think you're seeing the big picture here. What do you mean? What do you want to do with the rest of your life, Damon? What do l want to do? Be on reality television. Right. All right. -Goodbye, Damon. -Where are you going? What's wrong with reality TV? -Everything okay? -Everything's fine, yeah. Can l get you anything else? Another Coke? What is that, the orange drink they're having? -That's the Wallaby Darned. -Yeah? lt's our most popular drink. -Cricket! All right, l'll have... -You want one? Yeah, why not? l'm celebrating tonight, so... Yeah? What's the occasion? End of my first season as coach of the Lady Chargers. -You coach girls' basketball? -Yeah. That is so cute. l used to play. -Were you good? -l was okay, yeah. Not bad. -l bet you were. -Man, l bet they love having you as a coach, huh? They're okay. l don't know if they like me so much all the time, but... No, l bet they love you. -Well, l will bring you that Wallaby Darned. -All right, thanks. You almost done? -l feel great. -Great. -These are delicious! -They are, yeah. You... -Good day! -Yeah, okay. All right. -Maybe l'll get another one of these babies. -How about some coffee, Coach? -ls that a hint? -Maybe. l'm gonna go get that. -You know what'd be fun... -No, no, no, don't... Leave it, leave it. Please leave it. -Let me help you. l'm sorry. -Somebody will get it. l was just gonna ask you if you wanted to maybe go somewhere else -and have one of these with me. -No, but thank you. l didn't mean to grab you there. -l was just trying to... -lt's fine. -...get your attention. -Here's your check. l'll be back. l'm sorry. l shouldn't have asked you out. That was probably... Fuck! Shit. Okay, move it. Hey. -Sweetie, what are you doing here? -What are you doing here? What happened? l made a mistake, honey. l made a bad decision. Oh, my God! Girls, what are you doing here? -Why weren't you at practice? -l got fired. We heard. How the hell are we gonna play in the sectionals without you? You're gonna be fine. You got Donna. No, Donna doesn't know anything about basketball. To us, you're still the coach, so you better start thinking of a plan. -Okay? -And fast. -Let's go. -Here. What's this? lt's the tapes from all the games l've been taping over the season. See you around. l mean, it's a federal offense. Did you know that? You can't sell your prescriptions. You just can't. They're yours. Okay? You take them for a reason. l want to finish the season. -Forget it. -You want me to say please? l don't care what you say, all right, Bill? You blew it. -Let me go to the sectionals, Terry. -l said you blew it! -Come on, man. Let me just... -You broke my daughter's heart! You broke all their hearts. l'm sorry. Get out. Hey, girls. l just wanted to take a moment before we head to the sectionals tomorrow morning. l know you're nervous. l am, too. But just remember, we're a team. That's not something anyone can ever take away from us. Now, l've never been part of a team before, and at my age, it wasn't something l was expecting to ever happen. So, l want to thank you for giving that to me. My whole life, l've felt apart from other people. l don't feel apart from you girls. And no matter what happens tomorrow, l'll always be proud of you. -Go, Chargers! -Go, Chargers! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We can win. We can win. We can win! Set a trap. -Get off the road, you moron! -Shut up! Everyone ready? No. Are you serious, you guys? The game hasn't even started and you're already sitting here like we just lost! l mean, come on! Have you realized how much we've accomplished this year? l mean, we're a winning team, guys! That's cool! And l know Bill isn't here, but we were the ones on the court winning those games, each and every one of them, all by ourselves! With our talent and our skills and our minds, right? And if Bill was here, he wouldn't let us sit around and mope, right? Am l right? -Yes. -Yeah. l said am l right? -Yeah! -Yeah! Oh, my God. Whose house is this? -Our house! -Our house! Get up. Get up! l said, whose house is this? -Our house! -Our house! Our house! That's right! Go! Come on. Let's go, let's go! Abbie, get your head in the game. Focus. Come on, girl! Hate the Chargers! -No! -Come on! Hey, chica. -Can l see your green card? -Kathy, l'm open! Hey! Coach! -Coach, is that you? -Yeah. We can win! -What are you doing here? -Why are you so sweaty? -l rode my bike. -We missed you! We missed you! We don't have a lot of time. We don't have a lot of time. l think you can beat these girls if you switch your defense to a full-court press. These girls, they're healthy, you know? They're tall and healthy, but they're not good ball handlers. l want two defenders on the ball at all times. Keep them flustered, and they'll lose their cool. -You got it? Stay on them! -All right, we got it. Double-team them. Let's go. What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? Let's go! Come on! Come on! Go! Come on. Come on. -Double-team them. Yeah! -Double-team them? Tell them to set the trap. Keep them in the trap. -Trap? -Set a trap. -Trap. -l need a cigarette. -You gotta go. -What do you mean? -What do you mean, ''What do l mean''? -lt's my team! Come on, guys. Come on. Bill. l like the shirt. Yeah. l know you're being sarcastic. We won! -You're kidding me. That's great! -No, no, no. We won! We won 52 to 50! -All right! -lt's good, huh? -Yeah! -Yeah! What? Are you kidding me? She was nailed! Can you hear me? Billy. Hey, Billy. Hi. Hey, hey. How you doing? -How are you? -l'm okay. -Why don't you come sit with us? -ls that okay with Mr. Perfect over there? He's not perfect. Come on. Come on, ref, that was a foul! -That guy's an idiot. -She's gonna be heartbroken. Listen, tell her she played a hell of a game, will you? -Will you tell her that? -Yeah. She really did. All right, everybody. Huddle up. Huddle up. Come on, come on. All right, now, listen. l've seen this team play, and they're all D, which is easy to get around if you look for the open shot. You guys seen Hoosiers? l want you to pass the ball four times before you shoot. What's the most beautiful, beautiful play in basketball? -Does anybody know? -Dribbling? -Scoring? -Passing. That's right, passing. Do you know why? Because it binds you together as a team, okay? Remember, it's not whether you win or lose, it's who's afraid to play you next time. Let's go. One, two, three. One, two, three. -Go! Fight! Win! -Go! Fight! Win! Yeah! Look them in the eye! What's going on? They're double-teaming Kathy. What should we do? Okay, that's okay, that's okay. Wendy and Lisa are open, -so tell them to set the pick and roll. -Okay. And tell Tamra to get those offensive rebounds and chin it. Chin it when she gets those offensive rebounds. Are we winning? Good game. Good game. -Hey, what happened? -We're going to the finals tomorrow! Hey! You're going to the finals? All right! -Who are we playing? Who are we playing? -lt doesn't matter. -Who? -Prairie Hill. Prairie. Shit. No kidding. l'm going. l'm going. l'm going. l'm going. Okay. Hey, hey. -Call me. l'll meet you in the parking lot. -All right. Good, Coach. Are you sure he's coming? -Are you ready? -Coach! -Coach! -Let's go! -Okay. -We were waiting for you. Let's go! -So, what's the plan? -l don't know. l'm not sure yet. l don't know. You better come up with one quick. We're gonna be there in half an hour. Okay. l'm working on it. How do you expect to sneak by Tamra's dad without him recognizing you? l have an idea. -What? What is it? -Yeah? Yeah? -What is it? -lt's good. You're gonna hate it, but you're gonna do it.

Call a timeout. -Timeout. Ask Tamra what the hell is going on! He wants to know what's going on. Why is she letting that girl score all over her?
