You should feel like you at the highest point is in the world. Yes, if it is not raining. You come from Vancouver? No. I actually come from anywhere and nowhere. You must know that feeling, if you travel for work. I travel a little, yes. The nomadic life of a businessman. What time zone am I today? I try to remember where we met. That was at the conference Last year in New York. You and Jeff were selling a few West African plots. When I had no interest, but now I ... My company and I have to invest there, if it is current. I'm sorry, we have plots six months ago sold. Six months ago? Yes. - Then I have really bad luck.

Do you have anything in Hong Kong? Have you all ensured? Who are you? Late payments. Questions. Something is wrong. It's time for me Go get some answers. Serge is a nobody. He follows commands, just like me. I need a source. Someone I can trust. Quite an empire, you this creates Kerr. A little of this, a bit of it. Let me work legally. You'll never work legally. I put a few people in it. Come here. What do you need? Someone in Miami. - Done. Equipment? Dragunov. How about an N-170? Too much recoil. Goes through a brick wall. My goal is not a brick wall. A man who knows what he wants. I get it tomorrow in Miami. No problem. Call this number. Question to Constantine. He takes care of everything. One more thing. Can this man check? He says that his Mr. name. Graham. I think he is talking nonsense. Everyone in the investment Industry told nonsense. They destroy the world. He has too many questions. I liked nothing, what he meant. And what was that? That he knows who I am. Yes, I let him by a few Friends of the secret service check. Let's see, what I can do.

I am sure that your old comrades still know those who go to The Mafia have placed. I agree, your friend, Icarus! Vadim is an enemy of the people, Icarus. He is a traitor. The truth is a lie, Icarus! - Do it! Kill him! Please! Please! You're my friend! You have to murder him! Please, do not! Choices ... My boyfriend murder ... ... Or ... We must hurry, Vadim. I know where we boat can get. I put him in not seen for years. That is no surprise. Most people see Vadim Borazhelov never. When you came to America. both of you went your own way. Vadim worked his way to top of the crime syndicate and you work for his Mafia rivals. But Vadim wanted the Hong Kong store. Then began a war. Now you are the only that is over. You can find me not hold here. Actually we do, what we want. You see, you is not, which government will object? And then my family? They have a chance, you do not. How? Vadim is a dirty piece of work. I'm not you dirty work. I'll kill you and your family here. In your case will be that you not saved on the farm. Joey. Daddy! How have you handled them? Okay, I guess. I did not know what awaited us. Are you hurt? No. What happens now? Who are they? That is one last thing, I do it before we are safe. What did she say? They help us as I do something for them. No, that's a lie. Do not go! I have to. They use you. Even if I did not come back, they take care of you. You must come back! The time has come. We go. Daddy! Of course they use me. Just like the mafia. Like the KGB before. I have a new assumed command. And this time it's an old friend. I agree, your friend, Icarus! Vadim Kill now! I have a choice. Vadim was then escape his fate, so I secured mine. That was funny with fate. Follow him, then forcing to you, where you want. For closed. Bratstvo: a truly bad situation. A suicide bombing. No one interested in it, how I come out, while the work done. Hey Vadim, that Icarus back. Icarus! Icarus! It was so long ago. Come on, please! The best champagne. There are only 40 bottles of the world. I have 20 of. Life is interesting, do not you think? Cigar? I quit. It's nice to see you again. There are memories up. I agree. You look good. You look strong.
