No, I was here three years ago. We need a holiday T-bag! T-bag is here! It's so good to see you. My little pupalina. - Ah! Grazie mille. - Prego. Come on! So... how was the flight? How were the exams? Is it raining in England? Tell me it's raining. It's raining, isn't it? - This place is... - Wait till you see the inside. Come on! Oh, my God! It's not quite the pensione I recommended. Isn't it heaven? So... - How are you? - Fabulous! - Really? - Uh-huh. - What's on your iPod? - Er... I don't know. But I can tell you it would not be "Nothing Compares To You". Don't tell me you're actually over Doug? Doug who? This is the best holiday ever. I'm in love. - Puglia's beautiful, isn't it? - Uh-huh. I knew you'd love it. Thanks for flying me out. Hey, I wanted to celebrate your graduation. Congratulations on being officially the clever one, by the way. Thank you. You'll always be better at ballet. Hmm... true. So bringing you here was surprise number one. - Are you decent? - Who, me? Lil! Oh, my God! My little professor. Maddie never said you'd be here. Oh, well, when she told me Doug had dumped her, I was like, "Yes, hallelujah, man-tox time!" And is there a better way to spend my book advance? - Tiziana. - Eh? More Aperol Spritz, please? Si. - And a glass for you. - Per me? - She's a bit grumpy. - Nice Italian, though. Oh, she has got very familiar with the Italian tongue. So tell her. I'm getting married. Sorry, I thought you said you were getting married. Isn't it amazing? - Oh, my God! Not to Doug? - Oh, God, no! But... you're on man-tox. You're supposed to be finding yourself. Well, I did. Here I am. And there he was, so there we are. Are you crazy? How long have you known this guy? Five weeks, but it's enough. When you know, you know, you know? You said that about Doug... and Marcel and Connor. And Tarquin. This is different, he's... sensitive and kind and gentle. - Definitely not Doug, then. - He's just the most wonderful thing... - Grazie. - Prego. At least tell me it's a long engagement. That's why I had to get you here. The wedding is in two days. - That is insane. - I know! - Don't look at me. Puglia was your idea. - I don't remember telling her to... marry the first man she found when she got out of the taxi. He's wasn't the first man. He was, like, at least the fourth. - Have you lost your mind? - Mmm. Look, T, I was freaked out as well, but he is a great guy and you know I never say that. I just can't believe he wants to marry me. Oh, God, please don't start that again. You know why. - I do? - Yes. Because you're a goddess. Yes, well, I suppose that must be it. Goddess on a mountaintop Burning like a silver flame The summit of beauty and love And Venus was her name... Whoa! She's got it Yeah, baby, she's got it I'm your Venus I'm your fire Your desire Well, I'm your Venus I'm your fire Your desire Her weapons were her crystal eyes Making every man mad Black as the dark night she was Got what no one else had... Tss! She's got it Yeah, baby, she's got it I'm your Venus I'm your fire Your desire Well, I'm your Venus I'm your fire Your desire Venus She's got it Yeah, baby, she's got it... Ooh... really sorry. Goddess on a mountaintop Burning like a silver flame The summit of beauty and love And Venus was her name Yeah, baby, she's got it She's got it Yeah, baby, she's got it I'm your Venus I'm your fire Your desire Yeah, I'm your Venus I'm your fire Your desire What? What am I supposed to say? I'm thrilled? - Well... - I'm thrilled it's not Doug. I'll drink to that. I look forward to meeting him. Well, you will, tonight. There's a dinner. You're gonna love him. Anyway... what about you? Anything to report? Finals went OK. I may have messed up one paper. No, I don't mean boring stuff. I meant boys. Oh, come on! You're out of the library now. You've got to let your hair down and your inner goddess out. I'm not like you. I don't go all wobbly every time a boy takes his shirt off. Maybe she's just saving herself for her old flame? Who? What? - This is where T fell in love too, isn't it? - Taylor doesn't fall in love, - she's too sensible. - OK. What? I'm your sister and I don't know this. Hello? It was just a holiday romance. Just a holiday romance? Why didn't you tell me? You were in the middle of one of your worst breakups with Doug. So, what happened? Nothing. The holiday ended and uni started and life just got in the way. This is so exciting! You're back here. Maybe you could rekindle the whole thing. No... He was off to travel the world. Exs are like fireworks. Never go back to them. Either they blow up in your face or... Or they go all limp. I think I might get changed and pop down to the beach. See if I recognise any of the old crowd. OK. Taylor! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe you're here! Three years we've been waiting for you, We'd given up. - And you, when did you get back? - I never left. I couldn't leave Enrico. What? Does Raf know you're here? Ciao, bella! - What are you doing here? - Oh, that's nice! No, no. Dio mio, it's great to see you. But it's been ages, babes. - Hello, stranger! - Hi! - So, finally you come back, huh? - Yes. How are you guys? - Good. - Molto bene, grazie. Pretty much the same. - He's still sunburnt. - Oi! That's a healthy colour, that. - And you guys are still together? - Yeah, of course. Nothing changes. Yeah, but not everything is the same, you know? There's a boy I know He's the one I dream of Looks into my eyes Takes me to the clouds above Oh, I lose control Can't seem to get enough When I wake from dreaming Tell me, is it really love? Ooh, how will I know? Don't trust your feelings How will I know? How will I know? Love can be deceiving How will I know? - How will I know? - If he really loves me - I'll say a prayer - With every heartbeat - I fall in love - Whenever we meet - My love is strong - But I feel weak Oh, wake me, I'm shaking Wish I had him near me now Except there's no mistaking What I feel is really love Ooh, tell me, how will I know? Don't trust your feelings How will I know? How will I know? Love can be deceiving How will I know? If he loves me If he loves me not If he loves me If he loves me not, oh How will I know? Taylor? - I see you've met my fianc. - Your... What do you think? A bit too gorgeous, isn't he? - This is your fiance? - Yeah. Do you guys know each other? - Er... - No! Hi, I'm Taylor, Maddie's sister. She... she's your sister? Yeah. Can't you see it? T and I are like peas in a pod. What is that? T is for Taylor. - T is for Taylor. - What? Do you know these guys? No! Hi, I'm Taylor. Nice to meet you. Hi, how are you? They're normally much friendlier than this. Guys, it's my sister. - Ah-ha! Well, welcome to Puglia, Taylor. - Taylor, hi. Oh, so that's why you're here, for your sister's wedding. Yes, yes! And I am just so excited! I knew you'd approve once you met him. Isn't he divine? Yes, er... sorry, sunstroke! I think I need to go and lie down in a dark room. - Well, I'll come with you. - No, no, no. I'll be fine. Taylor. Taylor! Are you all right? - I just don't want Maddie to know. - But you and Raf... A holiday romance, years ago. It was so totally nothing. It's better to just pretend it never happened because it pretty much never did. OK, if you say so. - I'll see you at the dinner. - Yeah. - Have you got a husband at home? - Several but, none of them are mine. No, I don't do romance, marriage or biological clocks. Oh, Lil, everyone needs a man sometimes. I just change the battery. So, Lil, what do you do? I write erotic fiction. Ooh... If you need any help researching, I'd be happy to, er... I'm in Italy, babe. I'm not ordering the fish and chips. - I'm spaghetti bloody vongole! - I can't believe they're sisters. Why not? Er... yeah, like, you're just... sisters. What? Come on, Rafa, speech. Give it up for the man himself, mio migliore amico. That was beautiful, Mikey. Thank you. - No, you're beautiful. - No, you're beautiful. I could just stare at him all day. Er... I'm getting married. - Yes, Raf. - Hey! - Miss Maddie. - Mm-hmm. My friends can tell you that I don't really, usually, fall in love so easy. But... with you it was truly love at first sight. What can I say? You're amazing. Passionate. Brave. Not afraid to show the world how you feel. I'm just so lucky you're mine. - To Maddie. - To Maddie. All right, babe, your turn. - Oh, no, no... - Yeah. OK, yes, yes, yes. Er... well, I know that this has come as a bit of a surprise to some of you, not least to myself. Er... T... Mum's not with us anymore, but, er... well, you and Lil are all the family I need. You were the one who sent me here and I can't thank you enough because look what I found. Er... I've made a lot of mistakes over the years, and, Raf, I have to be honest, when I met you, I thought, "He's gonna be another one that won't last. "It's just another holiday romance. " But then suddenly I knew that some holiday romances are meant to last forever. The power of love is a curious thing Make a one man weep, make another man sing Change a hawk to a little white dove More than a feeling, that's the power of love Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right Power of love that keeps you home at night Don't need money, don't take fame Don't need no credit card to ride this train It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes But it might just save your life That's the power of love That's the power of love First time you feel it it might make you sad Next time you feel it it might make you mad But you'll be glad, baby, when you've found That's the power, makes the world go round Don't take money, don't take fame Don't need no credit card to ride this train It's strong and it's sudden and it'll be cruel sometimes But it might just save your life They say that all in love is fair Yeah, but you don't care - But you'll know what to do - What do to When it gets hold of you And with a little help from above You feel the power of love... Whoo! Don't take money, don't take fame Don't need no credit card to ride this train Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel You won't feel nothing till you feel You feel the power Just feel the power of love That's the power That's the power of love You feel the power You feel the power of love You feel the power of love You feel the power of love That's the power That's the power of love You feel the power You feel the power of love You feel the power of love You feel the power of love Taylor. Hey! Nice to see you again. This is crazy, huh? Yeah, but that's Maddie. She loves a big show. I mean, I had no idea Maddie was your sister. Yeah, she has been my whole life. I understand, but... But if I'd known, I would never... - But we're in love, so... - Yes. And I'm so thrilled. Congratulations. Thank you, and I'm pleased you graduated. That was what you wanted, right? So, er... congratulations to you too. Thanks. - OK, this is weird. - No, it's not. It's the opposite of weird, it's totally 'unweird'. - We gotta tell her. - No. OK, maybe it is a bit weird. But just because it's weird for us doesn't mean it needs to be weird for Mads. - I don't wanna keep secrets from her. - She's my sister. She means everything to me. If anyone deserves to be happy, it's her. So let's just forget it ever happened, please, and keep out of each other's way. - There you are. - Hey! - Getting to know each other already? - Yeah. Great, because I have a few wedding-y things I need you to do for me tomorrow, like help Raf sort out his suit, make sure he looks gorgeous for me. You'll get on like a house on fire. So much for you to talk about! Whoop! Whoo! Hey, guys, I'm coming! I thought you wanted to kite-surf the world. We are. The honeymoon. Oh, funny. Maddie always said she wanted Paris. Would you like to try them on? Oh, no, no, no. I'm not the bride, I'm... It's someone else that he's marrying. I'm no one. I'm just a friend. I mean, the sister of the bride. I guess what people want can change. Perfect. I didn't change, Raf. I just couldn't drop everything and run off... - into the sunset with you. - Yeah, I know. Your "real life", right? - How's that working out for you now? - Great! Cool. Are you seeing anyone? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Oh, sorry. Why are you sorry? Well, that's a no, isn't it? No, actually, it's not necessarily a no. I just don't wanna talk about it. I think that sort of thing is private and doesn't need to be sung from the rooftops. I forgot. Never say what you feel, right? I just don't see why people have to make such a spectacle of their feelings. Because if someone sings it from the rooftops, you know that they really mean it, and that's what weddings are all about. - Buongiorno. - Buongiorno. What do you want me to do, Taylor? Become a monk? I don't know, maybe not fall in love with my sister? But how could I know she was your sister? I never met two people less like each other. What's that supposed to mean? - Ciao. - Salve. You're the one who broke it off, and you forgot all about me! I didn't forget about you, I was working on my degree. Whatever. And, anyway, I'm not the one who spends all his days on the beach with hot girls in bikinis. Come on! You know I wasn't interested in them. I was waiting for you to come back, like you said, but then I realised you weren't, and then I met Maddie, and she was so open, so positive, so full of life. Full of life? So I'm not full of life? But... maybe you are, but how would anyone know? We shouldn't be listening to this. Come on, let's go. "Don't make a spectacle of your feelings. " Maddie made me happy again, OK? She brought me back to life. How many times do I have to say how happy I am for you? - Why are you so angry? - I'm not angry! I think we're done. Oh! Doug! Oh, you do miss me. What are you doing here? I'm hereto rescue you from making the worst mistake of your life. That is so sweet. Only you were the worst mistake of my life, so... Mads, Mads, Mads, Mads, come on! I know we've had our ups and downs, but that's all part of our thing, isn't it? It's a ride. It's a great, fun, sexy rollercoaster. All right, maybe we've had a big down these last few months. You dumped me! That just means we're due for a big up. Know what I'm saying? Bobcat... Doug, I don't want your great, big, sexy... ride anymore. I want to get off. I should never have let you go, Madison Jones. Hmm... I messed up. I'm man enough to admit that. Oh, this again! Come on, we are incredible together. You know that. Just go! One more chance. Come on, you owe me that. I don't owe you anything, except maybe a smack. How can you say that? You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar When I met you I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around Turned you into someone new Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet Success has been so easy for you But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now... - Sorry! - And I can put you back down too - Don't, don't you want me? - This is why I don't want to see you. You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me Don't, don't you want me? The idea that I can't survive without you! You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me It's much too late to find you think you've changed your mind You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh? I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar That much is true But even then I knew I'd find a much better place Either with or without you The five years we have had have been such good times I still love you But now I think it's time I lived my life as my own I guess it's just what I must do Don't, don't you want me? You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me Don't, don't you want me? You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me It's much too late to find you think you've changed your mind You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh? Which part of "I don't want you" don't you understand? The don't. I've been out with some jerks in my time, but you are in a class of your own. Oh, thank you! Why did I put up with it for so long? The hope, I suppose, that some day you'd be the one who'd go down on one knee. Certainly tried every other position. Just... leave me alone! All right, I get it. Had to try, right? I'll go. On one condition: have dinner with me tonight. - It's my hen night. - We'll do it early, very low-key. - No. - Come on. If those five years meant anything to you, one last meal. I can wish you well, show you there's no hard feeling. And then you'll go? On my honour. OK. - What's he doing here? - Lil... Oh, you're such a good friend to Maddie. She always looks so great standing next to you. And you were always such a good boyfriend to her, because she always looked so young standing next to you. He's just leaving. See you tonight... love monkey. - Tonight? - It's under control. It's never under control with Doug. He's your kryptonite. And he's a dick. Hmm... Mmm... Aah... Yeah... It was horrible hearing Raf and Taylor fight like that. They used to be so close. Is he still hurt that she didn't come back? Or is it the stress of us having to pretend we don't know Taylor? Or maybe it's just all the stress of the wedding. Yeah, could be. Or could it be that they were both body-snatched by aliens and are planning to take over the universe? Whatever you think, amore. Whoa! I love it when you give me your attention. Argh! Outrageous! Wanna play, do ya? What's your problem? My problem is that I hate lying and I'm terrible at keeping secrets. Ooh, what's the secret? Er... I'm pregnant. Oh, my God! That's amazing. You're happy, right? Yeah, yeah, it's just really early days and we're trying to keep it a secret. Oh, yeah, of course. Oh, but, wow! And you, are you excited? Still taking it in, really. God, you guys are gonna make the most amazing parents. What you gonna do? Ow! Please don't! Stop it, woman! How did you get on? - It was great. - Really, really well. So, Taylor, is there someone you'd like to invite to the wedding? How do you mean? Well, like a plus one. Oh, no. Well, what about the guy from three years ago? What guy? Oh, that guy? Er... no, forget about him. That guy, he's, er... he's gone. - I'll go for a swim, hmm? - OK. Gone? Gone where? Just... gone, OK? Well, does he know how you feel? If you want someone, you have to follow your heart. It might not be part of the plan but you can't just do nothing, you have to tell them. He moved on. Please. - Oh, I'm sorry, hon. - Why? Don't be sorry. Well, it would be nice for you to have someone there. I'm not you. I'm fine by myself. - No one is fine by themselves. - Yes, Maddie. You should try it sometime. Permesso... I got flowers for Madison Jones. Oh, gorgeous! Raf knows me so well. Oh, I love pink roses. "Looking forward to seeing you tonight, Doug. " What's he doing here? He just turned up out of the blue and hijacked me. It's just a final farewell. Well, slamming the door in his face said it perfectly. Well, it's nicer this way. Grazie. - What are you doing? - Don't worry, I can look after myself. When? When have you ever been able to look after yourself? Like, all the time. Yes, I'm out there, and yes, sometimes I make mistakes. You think? I know, Taylor, OK? But I live with those mistakes, and I don't expect anyone else to sort them out for me. It's better than locking your heart away, too scared of getting hurt. I've lived with your mistakes. Where do you think I've been for the past five years? And three years before that? And 18 months before that? Did it ever occur to you that maybe the reason I'm not all over guys all the time is because I've seen what a fool you've made of yourself again and again and again? Well, I'd rather be like that than the other way. And if I've made you afraid of opening yourself up to love, then I'm truly sorry. Is that my necklace? Just get off my stuff, OK? OK, ladies, break it up. Time to go. - Go where? - The tomato festival. - I'm not in the mood. - That's why you're coming. Oh, I wish I could, but I have a team of brilliant people coming to pluck, wax and tint me to within an inch of my life. Well, you're excused. You're not. I like tomatoes, I really do. But a whole festival? It sounds lame. Ow Ha Mmm, yeah I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down Cos I just can't wait till you write me you're coming around I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh And don't it feel good? - Hey - All right now And don't it feel good? I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true But I don't wanna spend my whole life just awaiting for you - And I don't want you back for the weekend - Not back for a day Oh, no, no I said, "Baby, I just want you back and I want you to stay" I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh And don't it feel good? Hey, are you all right now? And don't it feel good? Yeah, oh, yeah, now And don't it feel good? Walking on sunshine I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real I'm on sunshine, baby, oh I'm walking on sunshine, baby, oh I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh And don't it feel good? Hey, all right, now And don't it feel good? I'll say, I'll say, I'll say, I'll say, I'll say it again now I'll say, I'll say, I'll say, I'll say, I'll say it again And don't, and don't, and don't, and don't, and don't it feel good? Sunshine Don't it feel good now? Is that it? We gotta get clean before it dries. Come on. Where? Oh! Low-key? You deserve a decent send-off. You look stunning. Well, I'm in love. But then you always look stunning. Ah, my favourite. To... new beginnings. Now, that I will drink to. Remember the first time we opened a bottle of this? We stayed up all night, watched the sun come up. You said you could listen to my voice forever. No, I probably said it felt like I'd been listening to your voice forever. And, if I remember rightly, you only ever talked about yourself. No, I don't believe that, baby kitten. I'm sure you talked about me too. Oh, God... what am I doing here? Right. Come home. No, here. I'm getting married in the morning. Sounds like you're trying to convince yourself. No, I'm trying to get it into your thick head. Fine, fine. You want to get back at me. I understand that. But don't mess things up for yourself and this poor kid in the process. Doug, believe it or not, not everything is about you. Oh, please! You're only doing this to punish me. No, I came here to find myself. And I did. In Raf. I'd like to find myself... in you. Oh, God... Come on, Mads. Five minutes you've known this guy. Five weeks, and he's got to know me better than you did in five years. Do you know why? You didn't let him do that thing I wanted? Oh, you filthy little squirrel. - He listens to me. - I listen to you. - Oh, please, you don't let me... - I love listening to you. I... I love listening to... ...those sweet little sighs you make in your sleep. That crazy singing of yours in the shower. That noise you made that night at the George Cinq. I think the whole of Paris heard that. It was a wonderful night. And this is... It's wonderful. This stuff you're great at, the chase. It's the follow-through that lets you down. And I wanted more, Doug. I wanted marriage. We were perfect as we were. Why spoil it? No, do you know what's perfect? We never have to have this conversation ever again because I've found true happiness. That kid will never be man enough for you. Raf is young, yeah, but he's a grown-up. - You're not young, but you're a child. - Thank you. No, that wasn't a... God, you don't even want to grow up. - The thing about Peter Pan is... - He can fly. He ends up alone. It's beautiful. Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating? Do you understand? Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming? Is this burning an eternal flame? I believe it's meant to be, darling I watch you when you are sleeping You belong with me Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming? Or is this burning an eternal flame? Say my name, the sun shines through the rain A whole life so lonely, then you come and ease the pain I don't wanna lose this feeling Oh Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling Do you feel my heart beating? Do you understand? Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming? Do you understand? Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming? I need to know. You can't be here. - Something happened back there. - No! - Tell the truth. - Truth about what? Surprise! Oh, God, it's him! He was the guy. She's the ex? Mads, I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. - Yeah, but I-I... I can explain. - Please, I can do this. He was the guy, a guy. And I didn't want to tell you because it was nothing. But then you just kept going on at me about how I never let anyone in and I started thinking, "Did I make a terrible mistake?" And then we were on the beach, all covered in tomatoes, and there was this sunset and suddenly it was three years ago and I looked into his eyes and I knew... I don't feel anything for him. I never did. He's been desperate to tell you because he doesn't want to keep secrets from you. But I didn't want you to know because I didn't want to spoil everything and... ...well, you always make such a huge drama out of everything, which is why you two are so perfect together. But now I'm the one who's ended up making a huge drama out of nothing. I know I've been a really shit sister. And I'm so, so sorry. Is this true? Yes. And do you still have feelings for her? No, I feel absolutely nothing for her. I'm so sorry. Hen night? As in girls only. As in we don't wanna see you again until the church. I should probably just go. Yeah. Well, what are you waiting for? It's my hen party already. You look like shit. Go and get changed. Are you sure you want me there? Don't be stupid, T. We all make mistakes. Oh, yes! And tonight I intend to make a whole lot more. I come home in the morning light My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?" Oh, Mummy dear, we're not the fortunate ones And girls, they wanna have fun Oh, girls just wanna have fun The phone rings in the middle of the night - Your father yells - "What you gonna do with your life?" Oh, Daddy dear, you know you're still number one But girls, they wanna have fun Oh, girls just wanna have That's all they really want Some fun When the working day is done Oh, girls, they wanna have fun Oh, girls just wanna have...

I feel like I should have some wisdom to impart. All I can think is 50 different ways to say orgasm. Everything I know about real love I've learnt from you and Maddie. You know, you've got me through some really tough times, and I know you two have had it tougher than most. But we've always got through it together. We've always had each other, haven't we? When your mum died... Maddie told me that what really broke her heart was that your mum would never be at your wedding day. You've done the hard part now. Don't you wanna be there for her? Well, how long have we got? Shit! Hey, little sister, what have you done? Hey, little sister, who's the only one? Hey, little sister, who's your superman? Hey, little sister, who's the one you want? Hey, little sister, shotgun It's a nice day to start again It's a nice day for a white wedding It's a nice day to start again - Hey, little sister - Who is it you're with? - Hey, little sister - What's your vice or wish? - Hey, little sister, shotgun - Oh, yeah Hey, little sister, who's your superman? Hey, little sister, shot...

Where have you been? Where's Raf? It's a nice day for a white wedding It's a nice day to start again - Where have you been? - It's my fault. She had to stop me from performing an ill-advised aviation stunt, which is never a good idea after 12 sambucas and a minestrone. You look beautiful. Just one sec. You look beautiful. Taylor, am I making a fool of myself again? Raf's not like those other guys. He's a keeper. You done good. And what about you? Are you... really OK with this? Come on. Maddie. No matter what, you've never given up on love. You followed your heart wherever it leads. That's how I wanna be. Christ, don't make me cry now! I know it's out there for you. You just have to grab it when you see it, OK? - Oh, where's your dress? - Sorry... Er... it's not the only thing that's missing. Er... - My thong has gone! - What? This is news? Right. Are we ready? Yeah. - OK. - Yes. You all right, ragazzo. You look a bit perduto. No, I'm fine. I was just running naked down the street missing my own wedding cos some idiot left me duct-taped to a tree with a donkey. Ah, the donkey! Please everyone be seated. Welcome everyone to the wedding of Madison and Raffaele. Before we proceed, I'm obliged to ask... Does anyone know of any just cause or impediment why these two should not be wed? Oh, sit down, Doug. - Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up. - He has that effect on everyone. Let me ask again if anyone knows a cause why these two should not be wed. Well? Wait. Raf... Oh... All my life I've gone from wrong guy to wrong guy and now, finally, to have found a guy who's right... ...who's kind and decent and... ...beautiful inside and out. Because... you are the right guy. But it's not right. Not for me. I came here to find myself and I found you. This is the same thing I always do: running off into the arms of a man and losing myself. Er... it's incredible to me that someone as amazing as you wants to marry me. How could I not get caught up in that? The big church wedding, this... It's everything I've ever dreamed of. Until now. I'm in love with love. But am I in love with you? I don't think that I am. I'm so sorry. You deserve to be loved wholeheartedly. If I could turn back time If I could find a way... I'd take back those words that have hurt you And you'd stay I don't know why I did the things I did I don't know why I said the things I said Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes I didn't really mean to hurt you I didn't wanna let you go, I know I made you cry But, baby, if I could turn back time If I could find a way I'd take back those words that have hurt you And you'd stay If I could reach the stars I'd give them all to you And you'd love me, love me, like you used to do If I could turn back time If I could turn back time My world was shattered and I was torn apart You took a knife and drove it deep in my heart You walked out that door, I swore that I didn't care But I'd lost everything, darling, then and there Too strong to tell you I was sorry Too proud to tell you I was wrong, I know that I was blind And, darling, if I could turn back time If I could find a way I'd take back those words that have hurt you And you'd stay If I could reach the stars I'd give them all to you And you'd love me, love me, like you used to do If I could turn back time If I could find a way I'd take back those words that have hurt you And you'd stay If I could turn back time...
