It's still climbing. 7.0. 7.4. 7.7. Where's the epicenter? Downtown Seattle! 7.9! Aah! Dr. Hill. How big is it? I'm on my way. 7.9. We haven't seen activity like that since Denali. The Seattle Space Needle is down. S-waves are off the chart. The structure, designed to withstand a 9.1 quake, was toppled by the 7.9 quake... Let me call you back. That rocked Seattle this morning when a massive underground gas pocket ruptured 50 feet below the street, causing the ground supporting the entire downtown area to cave in. Yeah, we've got a lot of wires... Everything from pacific to the shoreline has been blocked off due to flooding. Hikers are stranded at Point Defiance Park, and reports of structural damage to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge... Aftershock. 4.6. 4.9. We need to narrow down that hypocenter. Might take a while. We're measuring several active lateral skips. Let's focus on the Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates, and if you get me infrared numbers in the next 30 minutes, that'd be great. Forget the Gorda plate. The rupture zone wasn't anywhere near Lake Shasta. The epicenter was about 162 miles east of us. I'm betting the Ellensburg area. Ellensburg? This is local. I've got subduction measurements from the north American plate. Local faults were ruptured, yes, but they were activated by something deeper. Trust me. Central Washington. I found evidence of several faults there last may. Sub-asthenosphere. Forget the hypocenter. We're not going to find a rupture with the equipment we have. Let's get some graphs of the affected areas, all right? Thermo and infrared. We're also looking for interacting faults. Someone call navstar. We're going to need satellite photos, asap. You got it. Denver call yet? We're still waiting on usgs. Good, then we still have some time to narrow the rupture lock zone. Could you get me the geo-lab in central Washington? Thanks. What are you doing, Sam? What do you mean? I mean, what are you doing? This is my operation. You don't just come in here and take over. All right. What was your plan? It's not about who has a better plan. It's about chain of command. You work for me, remember? Jordan, people want answers right now. And they're gonna get answers. Come on, where are my thermos? Let's go. Let's go. Yes. We're on it. Well, you're in a world of hurt, Roy. You're done, buddy. You're done. Okay. Show me what you got. Hang on to your jock strap, Roy. Denied! Playing for all the marbles today, Roy? Yeah. Is there any other way to play? You're down by two. Clock's ticking. What are you going to do, buddy? I don't know, Paul. What do you think I'm going to do? That's easy. You're going for three. You always go for the long shot when you get desperate. Who's desperate? Yes, you are, Roy. You're very desperate. You're just trying to get into my head again. Trying? I've been in your head since Harvard. Just because we're old roommates, you think you got me down, huh? I own you. Own this. Three points. I was right. You were desperate. You always go for the long shot. But I won. Yeah. You were lucky. Dumb luck. Yes? Mr. President, there's been an earthquake. Where? Seattle, sir. How bad is it? The Space Needle collapsed. Amanda! Come on, girl. We're gonna hit traffic. Relax, Clark. She's coming. You said she was coming a half an hour ago. You're not starting this again, are you? Starting what again? This is the first camping trip you've taken your daughter on in what, four years? I'm around right now, all right? And whose idea was it? Oh, come on... Stop fighting! Please! We're not fighting. Your mother and I are having a conversation. Thank God for divorces. Wait a minute. You're going camping dressed like that? Yeah. With this as your luggage? I need my music. Your music? You didn't help her pack? Okay, let's just go. You guys are giving me a migraine. Goodbye. Have fun. Oh, yeah. Don't take it personally. She's like this with everyone. She hates me, doesn't she? You'll have to ask her that. Are we going? Let's go! We are going. Just a minute. Oh, I almost forgot something. Look, I don't... I figured she'd need this. Thank you. Go easy on her, Clark. It's been a while. I'll call you as soon as we get there. Okay. Wanna be true gangstas pranksters pretenders to the throne yo, it's all about respect just kick it so just forget the rest yo, yo it's all about respect you'd better pack your bags yo This is governor Williams. Governor. There's been an earthquake in Washington state. They're asking for California's help. I'll be right in. Local hospitals have moved their patients to outgoing facilities. Most of pike place market has been flooded. As many as 200 people were seriously hurt when the downtown monorail collapsed. Memorial Stadium is down, and congestion on the I-5 has caused many commuters to overflow into downtown neighborhoods. Traffic in and out of Sea-Tac has all but halted... This quake is worse than the Northridge quake, sir. That area is going to be feeling the side-effects from this one for the next five years. How does this affect the rest of the nation, Daniel? Well, sir, right now, it's the story of the week. People are glued to their TVs, but I believe eventually, the financial impact of this one is going to send a ripple effect across the rest of this nation. And how is the governor handling this? He's doing his best to put out fires, sir. But how is he handling this personally? He's a bit overwhelmed, sir. They weren't prepared for this sort of scenario. Then let's give him a hand. He has to know he's not alone in this. We're going to do everything we can to help those people through this tragedy. Uh, Mr. President, you have a meeting scheduled with the German ambassador. Reschedule. Sir, he's not going to be pleased. Uh... you've rescheduled twice already. And I'm rescheduling it again. My people come first, Sean. Get to somewhere safe. Don't panic. Kind of try and keep an ear tuned to the radio, or, of course, television. Jordan... look, um... I'm sorry if I overstepped my bounds. It's just, I... I walked in there, and I just can't stand... Being out of control. I know. You're a control freak. It's one of the things I love about you. Oh, well, I hope that's a compliment. Sam, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry I came down so hard on you. All right? Do you accept my apology? Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. What's the problem? You recommended Marshall... Come on, Sam. He's not even published. We both know I have twice the experience. I was perfect for the job. No, you weren't. I know you're brilliant, Sam. I know you can run circles around Marshall, but... But? It's not just me, Sam. It's everybody you work with. Oh, really? Yeah. Let's hear it. People think... What? People think you're too focused. Too focused? I'm too focused? In a nutshell, Sam, you're not a team player, okay? And frankly, your theories are a little bit on the radical side. Oh, I see. You scare people. I see. Uh-huh. You want it too bad, Sam. You can't see the forest for the trees. Oh, well, I never heard that one before, but you know what? I will try to be less competent. I don't want to intimidate my colleagues. Hello. All right, what do we got here? Gunshot wound? Just missed his aorta. Bullet's still lodged. You give the heparin? Two minutes ago. Let's keep our eye on that pressure. So, did you and Jill make up? That's none of your business. Oh, that means no. Thank you very much. Step aside now. He's all yours, Zack. I got it. Keep pressure on that artery. This guy's a bleeder. Yeah, I'm on it. She still wants me to take the Porsche back. Can you believe it? Sponge. Are you going to? No way. It took me three months to get a turbo 911 in that color. You can't reason with her, huh? She wants a new house. How do you reason with that? Well, you guys just really need to talk. Nah. I'm gonna wait this out. She'll crumble eventually. Yeah? You sure about that? Okay, let's flush the pericardium. You don't want me to stop the bleeding first? No. Why not? Look at that EKG. See the rate? I'll cauterize the vein after I've got the bullet. The bullet can wait. Let me stop the bleeding, just to be safe. Bullet's lodged in a vein. Owen, relax. I've got it under control. If you need help, all you have to do is ask. Don't need help. Don't do the Maverick thing. Don't do it, Zack. Don't do it? Oh. Why, it's already done. Sponge, please. Boy, we sure saved this guy some bleeding and some scar tissue, huh? We need to talk. Thousands more are still missing in what many are calling the biggest disaster to hit the west coast in over a century. Most of the transportation in the Seattle area has all but halted as workers attempt to open up access... The faults were activated by a larger fault. We centered the epicenter nine miles South of Ellensburg. Did you confirm it with the university? UCW is down, but we got confirmations from both Denver and Spokane. State of emergency for the entire Seattle area... You were right, Sam. It's worse than I thought. To provide aid and relief to the victims of this tragedy. Every time you come in to assist me, it's the cowboy thing. It's the one-man Zack show. What's your point? We're a team. We're supposed to be working together. I had it under control. What if you hadn't? Would you have asked? It's never happened. I don't know. If you were wrong today, and that bullet was lodged in the aorta, that patient would have bled to death on my table... I'm not gonna concern myself with alternate realities, because the only reality of the situation is that I was right, and I saved that poor guy some serious internal bleeding. Who are you trying to impress, Zack? I don't even know what you're talking about. Then why are you always showing off in the O.R.? Look, what would you have done? Procedure. Procedure would have taken twice as long. The guy would have lost an extra pint of blood. Come on, why don't you tell me what's really on your mind? Why don't you just ask for help? Because I don't... I don't need help. Everyone needs help some time or another. No, no, not me. One of these days, you're gonna screw up and cost someone their life. Tell Jill I said hi. Finally the angels have come for you. Hello? It's me. What do you want, Owen? Zack says hi. That's not why you're calling. We need to talk. Well, you should have done that before you went out and bought that car. Come on, baby. Can't you just let it go? No, I can't, Owen. I think I deserve a reward now and then. What's wrong with that? What about me, huh? What about the kids? We're falling all over ourselves in this house. I like that house. It's too small, and you know it. Mom! There was a quake in Seattle. It's on the news. I'm on the phone. A lot of people bit it. I know. I know. I heard about it. The University of Washington and the University of Puget Sound have been closed until further notice. Over 2,000 people are reported missing in the downtown Seattle area... Oh, lord. What happened? Uh, the quake. We had a quake? No, in Seattle... See? Right there. That is exactly what I'm talking about. What are you talking about? You are too wrapped up in yourself to see anything around you, including us. I didn't call to argue. Then return the car, and that's final. Jill, hang on... The military has sprung into action... God... Just stop or you're both in trouble. Out. So, are we good now? Yeah. Why? Well, no reason. It's just, we've only been on the road less than an hour, and we've already had to make a pit stop. Well, do you have to be somewhere? No, I'd just like to be at the campground before it gets dark. I don't see what the big rush is. We're not in a big rush. Well, if there's no rush, then why are you pressuring me? Look... why don't we just drop it? Fine. It's dropped. We've got seismic activity in Northern California. We're getting activity all over Northern California. Berkeley's reporting an 8.4 aftershock. 8.4 aftershock? That's bigger than the original quake. That doesn't make sense. Well, we're getting reports here it was felt as far as South of San Bernardino. Are you sure it was an aftershock? Yeah. We can't find the hypocenter, and there doesn't appear to be any new rupture zone. What about everyone else? Portland? Los Angeles? Same. There's nothing. Bob, we will do everything in our power to help you out during this crisis. I know how difficult it must be right now. You can count on our support. Excuse me, Governor. You have another call on line 2. One moment. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to put you on hold. Rachel, I hope this is important. I'm talking with the governor of Washington. I think that it is. This is Governor Williams. Outside of Redding? Just now? Are you sure? An entire train just disappeared outside of Redding. Just disappeared? In the same location as the other seismic activity. What? Take me in closer. Sure. No problem. Now, closer in on that line. Here we go. Make me a hard copy. Yeah, you got it. 120 people were on board when the train vanished. Rescue teams are now searching for survivors. Dad, can you please put my music back on? Hey, this is serious. Lighten up. They said it was just an aftershock. People were probably hurt in it. Look, I realize that you're going through your own thing right now, but do you think you could consider someone else once in a while? Oh, okay. Is this your version of parental advice? Yes. Who are you to give me advice? I am your father. Oh. Why don't you try being my father and be there once in a while? What do you call this? This is something on your to-do list. You can't get off that easily. I don't know why I even try. How did I know you were going to say that? God. Governor, do you want to issue a statement regarding the missing train? No, not yet. Not until we have all the facts. Where's Rachel? Rachel? Jimmy, we already talked about this this morning. We've been waiting for two years now. I thought you wanted to have a family. Yes. Yes, I do, but not now. Now is not the right time. All right, then when? You know, it is never going to be a perfect time, Rachel. Rachel... I love you. I love you. Jimmy, this is such a bad time. Can we please just talk about this when I get home? Please? Rachel! Rachel, where are you? Jimmy, I've got to go now. Rachel, where are you? Yes, coming. Rachel? Oh, there you are. Any news in the last 10 minutes? No, nothing yet. What about the relief effort for the Seattle area? Let everyone know I've already been on the phone with the governor of Washington. And we're doing everything we can. And the fact that they're calling this aftershock an 8.4? It isn't sitting too well with a lot of people. When I have more answers, I'll call a press conference. Till then, the last thing we need to do is add to the panic. We'll get through this. Let's take it step by step. All right? Jordan? Can we talk? What is it? What if that wasn't an aftershock? It could be its own distinct quake. Two separate earthquakes, back to back? Do you know what the odds of that happening are? The odds of an aftershock being larger than the original quake are worse. So where's the hypocenter? I don't know. You're not making any sense, Sam. Wait. Maybe it's deeper than we think. Deeper than we can measure. Deeper than we can measure? It's just a theory I'm working on. What's the theory? I don't want to say just yet. Might as well say. You're thinking it. All right. You know I've been working on the San Andreas fault and other possible fault lines interacting with the North American plate, like the San Jacinto fault, the Pinto Mountain fault, the Blanco fracture zone... I read your book too, Sam. While I was researching those faults, I discovered something that led me to believe there may be a few others. Deeper ones. How deep? Below 700 kilometers. 700 kilometers is the deepest. They don't get any deeper than that, Sam. I'm convinced they do. Two here. Four here. How come no one else found them? We don't have the equipment to measure that deep. It's like galaxy predicting or measuring anti-matter. You can only extrapolate based on what we can see. So you're thinking that these theoretical faults are interacting with each other. Interacting with each other and other known faults, yes. It's a possibility. I'm not gonna lie to you, Sam. It's a stretch. Calling that 8.4 an aftershock is a stretch. Just because we can't find the fault line doesn't mean it doesn't exist. You should know that. I know that, but I can't take this to USGS. Jordan, look at the pattern. What if I'm right? What if these two quakes were building on each other? A chain reaction. I'm speculating here, but if my theory is right, there's a very high probability that more will follow. Think about it. 7.9. We've got 8.4. What's next? An Ontrack passenger train was reported missing moments after communication was lost with it. Rescue teams... This is a nightmare. Have settled on a rural area... Two earthquakes occur 800 miles apart on the same day? I'm not an expert, but I think it's fair to ask some questions here. Well, technically, they're calling the second event an aftershock. Who's "they"? And have we confirmed this information yet? This information comes from a number of different sources. Nothing has been confirmed yet. Right now, most people are just speculating. And that's exactly what we don't need right now, speculation. There's a lot of scared people out there... And they have a lot of questions about what just happened. Someone has to have the answers. We need a face to this disaster team, someone everyone can look to. Mr. President, we're dealing with two governors and their administrations here, not to mention the mayors of the affected cities. This might take some time... We don't have time to cut through the red tape. By the time the left hand has figured out what the right is doing, this will have exploded in all our faces. Get me Nolan. He's perfect for the job. What about the governors, sir? Have they come forward with someone? No, sir. Not yet. Well, I have. If they have a problem with my choice, they can give me a call. They have my number. Could you get Mr. Nolan on the phone for me, please? Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. President. I understand. Roy, we're gonna need a base of operations. I'll start setting up a disaster management center immediately. We'll need to gather the best in the field. Seismologists, geologists. We need to figure this out as soon as possible. I understand. Who do you have in mind for this? I'm working on a list as we speak. All right. You'll report directly to me. How do you want to approach this? Let's set up a press conference. Let's hit this disaster head-on. Good idea. People need to know you're in charge. You up for it? I'm up for it, Paul. You'd tell me if you weren't, right? No, sir, I would not. The ball's in your hands, buddy. If anyone can pull this off, it's you. I understand. Thank you. I won't let you down, Mr. President. You're okay. Get some coffee, Zack. We're gonna be here a while. What's going on? You didn't hear about those two quakes? Yeah, well, I saw something on TV. The hospitals can't handle the overflow. All the injuries from the two quakes, they're helevacing them down our way now. Should be here within the hour... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Owen, I just got off a double. I need you here. You got it. Thought so. But at this point, they don't even know where to start exactly. At this point, they're simply trying to save lives and make sure that as few people get injured or die as possible, so... Is that why dad's working at the hospital? Helping all those hurt people? Mm-hmm. There's a lot of people that need help. I just hope the ground stops shaking so Dad can come home. Me too, Calvin. Me too. No! What's going on? I don't know. In the wake of these two devastating events, Northern Washington and Northern California have been declared federal disaster areas. President Hollister has appointed Roy Nolan the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Nolan will be coordinating the efforts of a special investigative team to explore the causes of these two incidents. I just thought that you, of all people, would know something. Zack, I'm sort of busy at the moment. Something I can do for you? Yeah, you can tell me what the hell is going on. Dad, please. Come on. No, I can't. It's an official state of emergency. I'm sorry. I never ask you for anything. Just level with me, Dad. Come on. I don't have time for this right now. I'm very, very busy. Right. You'll... You'll let me know when you do, though, right? I'm not making any promises. I'll let you know as soon as I can. Okay, good. Wouldn't want to hold you accountable for something. What was that? Nothing. I've got to go, dad. Zack? Dad, got to go. Bye. What's going on? I don't know. They say, "jump," we say, "how high?" Roy Nolan, the head of FEMA, asked for us specifically? That's right. Why? I don't know. We'll ask him when we get there. Where? Los Angeles. Los Angeles? But I didn't get a chance to pack. Your husband Jimmy's on the phone again. Donna, could you please just tell him I'm sorry, but I'll call him back later? He's called four times already. Just tell him that I'll talk to him when I get home. Thank you. Okay. Great. This could take hours. What if I have to pee? We just stopped. Oh, excuse me for not being on your schedule. All right, we can fix this. What? Dad! What are you doing? Thought you said you had to go. Well, yeah, but... We don't even know where this road goes. Then I suggest that you sit tight and relax. Dad... When Mom hears you're doing this... Yahoo! Oh, I missed doing this. Dad! Oh, my God! I can't believe this. There's a road. Well, which way should we go? I don't know. We could try that way. No. That way. All right. Whoo. Hey. We need to know what we're up against. Now, are these aftershocks going to continue, and if so, how big are they going to get? Each and every one of you are here today because you're the best. This nation is counting on your expertise and knowledge. You'll have access to some of the most advanced equipment possible, and if there's something that we don't have that you need, let me know. Any questions? All right. Let's get to work. Sponge, please. So what did your dad say? He share any secrets? Same thing he always says. Nothing. What's his problem? He's into avoidance. Sponge. Out of sight and out of mind. That's the way it works with him. If it's not right in front of him, he doesn't have to deal with it. That includes me. Suction. It's okay, though. I'm getting used to it. He avoided my mom's funeral. He avoided every birthday and Christmas of mine since then. Sorry to hear that, Zack. Nothing to be sorry about. I've accepted it. Dad avoids. Well, I wish my mother- in-law would avoid me. Dr. Hill? Yeah. I think these are for you. Thank you. Was there something else? I just wanted to introduce myself. Zoe Cameron. I'm doing my graduate work at ucla. Really? If there's anything I can do to help you, just let me know. I'll be around. Okay. Thanks, Zoe. Look at this. What is it? Look at these dark spots. Dust clouds. Yeah, but from what? They all seem to be originating from this spot here. What's that? What's right there? Mount Renault. Yeah. What are you thinking? Can you get me a measurement on Mount Renault before and after the last quake? Yeah. Right away. Jordan? Bear with me. I'm onto something here. The aftershock in Redding was a fluke, an anomaly in the Pacific Plate subduction zone, exacerbated by the wet weather this region has been experiencing. Maybe this wasn't an aftershock. Excuse me? What if if this was a quake with its own epicenter? A quake? We're listening. Let's look at what we know. Our first quake was here. Ellensburg, near Seattle. Our second quake, here, outside of Redding. How can you be so sure it was a quake? See these dark spots here? These are dust clouds. Where do you think they come from? Mount Renault. Prior to this "aftershock," as you're calling it, this mountain measured 1,756 feet. Afterwards, 1,736 feet. The mountain dropped 20 feet. Aftershocks don't do that. It takes a quake, a very deep quake, to unsettle a mountain like this. So you're saying that the second quake was caused by the Seattle event? It's possible that this was a chain reaction caused by the same fault... An undiscovered super-fault that could potentially connect all the faults along the West Coast. If you look at these last two quakes, you'll notice something similar about them. The tectonic activity was side to side on both quakes. This fault is deep, and I believe it's only a matter of time before it ruptures again. So, according to your hidden fault theory, we could be looking at the big one? It's not out of the question. We have to look at all the possibilities. It's our job, right? That's why we're here. This theory of yours is, uh... certainly interesting. Does anybody else want to speculate? There's a definite pattern here. These aftershocks were felt all the way down to San Bernardino. That's an enormous area of activity. If I'm right, these ruptures will continue South, interacting with other fault lines, increasing in magnitude. I think the public deserves to know what they're up against. We're not going to create a panic situation based on an unproven theory. Then let me prove it. Thank you, Dr. Hill. That will be all. This was a waste of valuable time. Mr. Nolan, I have something I'd actually like to show you that makes sense. Sam, can you slow down? They don't want answers. They want excuses. There's a way of going about this. You're not doing it. They don't want to solve the problem. They want to pacify the public. I'm not going to be a part of it, Jordan. Can you relax? Will you just calm down, please? It's right there in front of them. All they have to do is open their eyes. I'm on your side. You acted like it back there. You have to build a consensus before you posit a radical theory like that. That was not the right time or place. Now, I believe the second was a quake. But you don't believe there's a fault? Right. I'm gonna hold off on everything until we have all the facts. You do that, Jordan. Sam... Twilight zone. What? Those birds overhead. That is weird. What are they doing? I don't know. They can't seem to make up their mind which way to go. Dad, what's going on? I don't know. Roll up your window. Maybe we should turn around. There's something up ahead. You wait in the car. No. What happened? I don't know. Looks like the bridge collapsed. Doesn't make any sense. Watch your step. Where's Browning? It's gone. Wait. Listen. What? It sounds like country music. It's the radio. No. I shut it off. Dad, I've heard that stupid song before. Yeah, it's definitely country. It's coming from down there. Well, where are you going? I'm going to go down there and check it out. What for? 'Cause if there's anybody down there, they're going to need help. Dad, there's nobody down there. What if there is? Well... It's all right. I'll be back in a minute. Okay, well, then I'm going with you. No. One of us needs to stay up here. Why? Would you please just do what I'm asking you to do? Okay! Please. Okay. Well, do you see anything yet? No, not yet. It's definitely getting louder. Everything I love is gone I think I'm right on top of it. There's definitely something here! Dad, let's just go! Just give me a minute, would you, Amanda? What? What do you see? Amanda, get back in the truck. Why? What? Don't argue with me. Just get back in the truck. Okay. I'm going. Okay. Dad... What did you see down there? They were dead, weren't they? The family at the rest stop. They were buried. That's why this road ended. That's why we couldn't find a town. They were buried alive. No. Yes, they were. Why are you lying to me? Come on, let's get in the car. Do you understand that could have been us? Amanda... Sweetheart? Come here. Did you bring your thing? Is it in your bag? Is it in your bag? In here? Breathe it in deep. Do it. Do it again. Is that better? Come on. Come on. Come on. Dad, I just want to go home, okay? That's what we're going to try to do, sweetheart. We're going to try to get home. Thank you. The families of everyone aboard that train need to be notified. This is not a recovery mission yet. We're still calling this a rescue mission. Absolutely. All right. Rachel? Yes, governor? My ex-husband and daughter are up north, camping. Um, I haven't been able to reach them. I understand, governor. I'll look into it right away. Thank you. That's a hard sell, Roy. More quakes? Can you actually predict something like that? Well, under usual circumstances, uh... no. But you thought you should bring it up? I just want you to be aware of all the possibilities. I appreciate your candor, Roy. So where is the idea coming from? One of our team members, Dr. Hill, she believes in this theory pretty strongly. She's done some cutting-edge research in the field and documented her findings. What about the rest of your team? Negative. They're not on board. Do you believe it? Much of her theory is based on extrapolation. It's based on... You know, what we can't see. I wish I could bring you some hard evidence on this, but I can't. What's your gut tell you? I don't know anymore. That's not good enough, Roy. We can't just go around spouting theories we don't even believe in ourselves, scaring the hell out of the public, but if there's a chance her theory is right and lives are in danger, that can't be ignored. What do you want me to do, Paul? Get the evidence, Roy. I'll get right on it. I don't want a word of this to anybody outside of your group. We don't need to create a panic situation. I understand, Mr. President. Great. I don't think that was an aftershock. Well, until I find some evidence, it doesn't really matter what I say. What kind of pattern is this? That's a side to side. It was taken minutes before the event. Well, what about this, right here? That's pre-activity. Wait a minute. This isn't side to side. It's a lateral skip. What do you mean? See how closely they're spiking? Side to sides have at least twice as much space between them. I'm sorry. I'm not following you. Aftershocks are supposed to have the same pattern of movement. This is completely different. This is another quake. Thank you. Any time. Mr. Nolan, can I speak with you? Yes? We looked into the event outside of Redding. It had an epicenter. You found an epicenter? We found evidence of it. If there's a fault, it's too deep for our equipment. There's nothing we can do short of going to the site. Can you prove this? We can measure magnetic field, radon activity, variances in water level, total absence of earth movement... Yes or no. Yes. Yes, I can prove this. If this whole notion of yours turns out to be a wild goose chase, this won't be good for you. I know. And you still want to go? Yes. Okay, you'll answer to me and to me only. Is that understood? Yes, sir. Thank you. Governor, we've just lost an entire community at the base of Mount Renault. Which towns have been affected? Browning has been completely buried. We're trying to get rescue teams out there right now. What's the delay? The dust is too heavy for us to fly in, and I-5's been shut down from, uh... Sacramento to Oregon due to structural damage. I want every possible survivor out of there. Mm-hmm. Contact Washington, D.C. I'm going to declare a state of emergency. Yes, governor. What's on the other side? Sam, where are you going? Nolan gave me the okay. What? I'm going to Redding. You're going to Redding? Mm-hmm. Something wrong with that? No, I just didn't think that he'd, uh... Have faith in me? Not everyone's as close-minded as you are, Jordan. Sam. Wait a minute. So, uh... can I come? And actually get your hands dirty? That's not you anymore, Jordan. Whoa, whoa. Wait. I've been a little caught up in office politics lately... Yeah, a little. All right, I deserve that, but I can still help you. If you come, we're doing this my way. Fine. You're sure you want to take orders from me? Yeah. Get your stuff. Foxtrot, this is Tango, calling Unit 415. Riverside, do your read? Over. How close do you think we are? 15, 20 miles. You really think we're going to find your fault line here, huh? I'm certainly going to try. Just out of curiosity, how? I thought you said you read my book. You just don't quit. If you think I'm doing this to spite you, you're wrong. Dead wrong. Actually, I was about to say I admire that about you. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. Hmm. All right. The largest rupture should have happened here. There's got to be an easier way than this. I'm sure there is, but it's not as much fun. After we take the soil samples, I want to measure the magnetic field. I guess we'll look for Radon, get the strain gauge. Oh. It's good to see you haven't forgotten everything. Don't start in on me, Sam. What? Mr. Nolan, we have reports that towns are missing in Northern California. Well, for whatever reason, I can assure you, my people are getting to the bottom of this. Mr. Nolan, we've had reports that entire towns in the Northern California area have been without communication. Now, what is your assessment of the damage caused by this second quake? Well, we don't have the numbers yet, but, uh... I promise you, we're going to meet this crisis head-on, and once my people have evaluated the data and have made an accurate assessment, we'll start putting the numbers out. Mr. Nolan, you must have a general idea by now. Well, like I said, we have to be very careful with the information we release, especially right now. Translation, it's bad. How can you tell? Look at him. Look at him. He's ducking and dodging like a featherweight. Fall into the ocean. These theories are completely unfounded. I know it makes great news to say that the big one is coming, but I'm not interested in sensationalizing this tragedy. I'm interested in damage control. He seems like he knows what he's talking about. But that's his job. You know, my mother never stood a chance when they argued. From all the data I've received, this threat is behind us, and that's the end of this conference. He knows something he's not telling us. I don't feel good about this. I don't understand. We should have found something by now. Maybe we're in the wrong area. No. This is where the activity was documented. If we don't find any evidence, Sam, we don't have a leg to stand on with Nolan. I know. Our credibility goes out right out the window. I know. I know. You don't have to remind me. There's something we're missing here. Yeah, it's called evidence. No. We're starting too big. What do you mean? We've checked all the obvious rupture areas, the bigger ones, and come up empty. You think we'll have better luck with the smaller points? Think about it, Jordan. If this fault is deep, how much activity is actually going to make it to the surface? Recordable activity? Okay. Now, see these larger areas? They're not part of our fault. They're from the faults affected by our fault. That's why they're on the surface, but these smaller areas are not part of the San Andreas or San jacinto faults. They veer away from them. Exactly. That's why they're so tiny. These deep faults sometimes never leave a rupture point. The ground soaks up all the activity before it ever gets to the surface. So then these tiny points would represent the end of the road. Mm-hmm. You try screaming through 700 kilometers of earth and see who hears you. Why do I get the feeling you've tried that? We're lost, aren't we? Why don't you just go back to sleep, sweetheart? I did that already. Look, I... I really don't want to fight with you again. I... I thought this trip was supposed to be a fun time. Oh, I forgot. What are you doing? Calling Mom. Is that okay with you? Yes, it's okay with me. It's just that I tried that already. God. Figures. Hang on. What was that? I don't know. Dad? Dad! We're sinking. Sinking? What? You mean, like quicksand? Yeah, maybe. Dad? Drive! Oh, my God. Don't you have four wheel drive? It's in four wheel drive. It's just not helping. Oh, my God. Dad, what are we going to do? I don't know. We've got to get out of here. Dad, I can't get the door open! Mine won't either. We can't stay in here. Calm down. Calm down. We're gonna get buried in here just like that family! Amanda, we're not gonna die. I'm gonna open your window. What? No. No, no. I don't want to. Get out. It's all right. Come on, Amanda. You can do it. Go on! Climb out, sweetheart. Go on. Climb out! I don't want to die! Climb out, sweetheart. Come on, dad, let's go! Dad, come on, follow me! Amanda! Dad! Get away from the car! Dad! Dad! Dad! I can't find you! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, where are you? Dad! Dad... Come on, dad! Please! Don't do this. Don't do this. Dad! Dad! Dad, please. Dad, where are you? Amanda! Dad! Dad, I've got you! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad. Come on. I've got you. Come on. Dad, come on. Dad, I've got you. Dad! Dad, come here! Dad, I've got you. Come on. Come on! Hurry! Come on. Come on. Come on. Dad, don't leave me again. I won't. I won't. Come on. Let's get out of here. We're wasting our time with this. Right here. We should be right on top of a rupture point. Well, it's a nice theory, Sam. Have you ever been right and you know it, and you're just waiting for everyone else to catch up? That's the kind of talk that gets you in trouble, Sam. If I was wrong, that would make you feel really good, wouldn't it, Jordan? It's not about right or wrong. I just don't think you're going to find anything here, okay? Why did you come out here with me? Sam, we need a new game plan. I don't have another game plan. This is my game plan, Jordan. Hey, I'm not the enemy here. Look around. What we want is not here. Fine. You want to go? Let's go. Come on, Sam. No, it's been uphill since day one with you. I'm not doing it anymore. Sam, can we just talk about this like adults? What? What's wrong? Look at that. What do you think happened? I don't know. I don't see any wounds. But it's weird. It looks like they just dropped dead. They probably did. These animals were poisoned. Poisoned? All I can think of is ruptured gas pockets. Poisonous gasses. Oh, no. Come on! Come on! Shut your door. You're not actually thinking... Yes, I am. Roll up your window. Sam, these gas pockets are usually pretty deep. I know. Really deep. I know. You brought the gas masks, right? Tell me you brought the gas masks. If you're right, this could prove your depth theory. Jordan, the gas masks. Where are they? Gas masks. I'm trying to remember. Jordan, where are they? I'm feeling kind of dizzy. Where are they? Jordan. Jordan, stay with me. Don't go to sleep. Jordan... Jordan! Dammit! Wake up! Put this on. Jordan! Jordan! Jordan. Ow. Did you hit me? I thought I lost you. Ow. Thanks. I owe you one. We need to get these samples tested and cross-referenced with the Gorda plate. We're looking for depth analysis. I also want to get some thermo images analyzed with the known rupture points. Sam, I want to apologize to you about before... For not believing in you. Thanks. I knew you'd come around. Now if we can just get everyone else on board, we might stand a chance here. Okay, your plane is ready. Your flight arrives in San Francisco at 6:00 P.M. The press conference with Mayor Spaulding is scheduled for one hour after that. Thank, you, Donna. Are you sure it's wise to travel right now? I can't hide in here forever. Besides, the people of this state need to see their leaders, now more than ever. What is it, Donna? We've, um... We've been trying all day. We haven't been able to contact your family. I see. We're not going to stop trying. I appreciate that. Governor, forgive me for being forward here. We both know that Clark is not going to let anything happen to Amanda. I know that. It's just there's so many things that could have gone wrong. I should have said no. I should have stopped them from taking that trip. They would be safe right now. You had no way of knowing this would happen. You said it yourself. They both needed this time alone. I know. I know. I... They're going to be fine. I hope so. Thank you, Donna. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Dad, I lost my inhaler. We'll figure something out, sweetheart. How? When? I don't know. Just one step at a time. Dad, we're never going to last out here. Look, all you've got to do is break it down in your head. Do you see the bend in the road up there? Yeah. All you think about is getting there. Yeah, and then what? We'll worry about the "and then what" once we get to the bend in the road. See how breaking it up in your head makes it easier? Yeah, nice try, dad. This still sucks. Yeah. It still sucks. What's that? It's an extrapolation. I factored in the last two epicenters. Now, throw in these gas pockets. This fault is deep. It's worse than I thought. Can you show me? This fault not only interacts with San Andreas. It interacts with every major fault line all the way to Baja California. So if you're right, the next quake... Should be right there. San Francisco. San Francisco? How concrete is this information? I told you. It's a prediction, or as close to one as you can get. It's not enough. I have soil samples and gouge proof that two fault lines interacted, and we have personally witnessed ruptured gas pockets, indicating how deep this is. I understand that this quake may have been deep. I'm not questioning that, Dr. Hill, but you're asking me to believe in a fault line that we can't even prove exists. You're asking me to evacuate millions of people based on, uh... On what? Some dirt samples? Some ruptured gas pockets? Look at the thermo activity map for yourself. Every major fault line is in jeopardy. Yeah, people should be evacuated, right now. If a quake hits San Francisco with anywhere near the magnitude of our last two, we'll be facing a huge disaster. And if you're wrong, and you do admit there is a possibility you are wrong, an evacuation like this will cause enormous panic. Lives will be lost. Our job is to... To calm people down, not get them worked up. No, it's our job to arm the people with the facts, good or bad, and that's what I'm trying to do. Facts that contradict the data collected by this task force. Mr. Nolan, I pray that I'm wrong, I really do, but I don't think I am. That fault line is unstable, and it will rupture again. And more than likely, it will happen in a very populated area. We need to prepare for this. I'm sorry, Dr. Hill. There's not enough to go on. I can't support this theory. I appreciate the effort, and we'll certainly take everything into consideration. But you're not going to do anything about it. Yes, I'm going to do something about this. I'm going to do my job, just like you're doing your job. I'm going to pass this information over to my superiors and let them decide. You mean the president and his advisors? Why don't you get them on the phone right now so they can hear Dr. Hill's explanation? It's not that simple. Why? There are other considerations. You could make a mistake and have to own up to it. That's enough, Dr. Fisher. What are you going to do when it comes out that you had information that could have saved millions of lives and you sat on it? I'd stop right there, Dr. Fisher, before you step into something you can't get out of. It was all for nothing. You did your job. That's all anyone can ask of you. Did I? Maybe you're right about me, Jordan. Maybe I don't know how to build a consensus. I don't know how to get things done that way. There wasn't enough time. I have to convince him. Thanks for backing me up. That man's a fool not to listen to you. I couldn't help overhearing in there. You said San Francisco's next, right? That's right. How certain are you? I'd bet my life on it. Oh, no. Judy. I understand you've declared a state of emergency. This flies in the face of the statement just issued by FEMA. Are we in danger of another quake? I don't have that answer, but our state was hit by a tremendous quake earlier today, and we are responding as best we can. We're pooling all of our resources to rebound from this tragedy, and yes, we are receiving aid from the federal government. Marvin? Do you know how many people are still missing? Do we have an estimate of casualties? No. We're still tabulating those numbers. I'm not going to lie to you. I believe they're going to be high. That's the bad news. The good news is I'm confident that we can and will overcome this obstacle. Next question? How long do you expect it will take the state to recover from this tragedy? As long as it takes, but we will recover. There's no doubt about it. We will get back on our feet again. Governor Williams, how are you responding to the millions of dollars in damage? The issue right now is people, and trust me when I say it is our first and foremost priority to see that everyone is safe and accounted for. We will be doing everything to bring our loved ones home, even if I have to personally oversee the rescue of every individual involved in this tragedy. You have my word on that. Governor Williams. Yes? Is it true you've lost contact with your own family? Yes, it's true, but there are many, many people in the states of Washington and California who have lost touch with their loved ones. I think we all have been affected in one way or another. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Right this way. Oh, my God! 7.9! 8.9! It's a 9.2! Where's it located? San Francisco! Rachel! This is Troy Keller from Sky-Cam one. This is unbelievable. I'm looking at this with my own eyes, and I can't believe it. The bridge is shaking. It's moving. Governor! Governor! Over here! Mayor! Mayor! Oh, my God! This way! Hurry! We've got to go! It's too late! It looks as if the entire bridge is going to fall into the bay. The entire structure is going to give way. It's breaking. It's breaking up! Cars are tumbling into the water. This is incredible. Come on! Come on, let's go! Look out! My God. My God. There it goes. Those struts are falling inwards. The whole structure is collapsing into the water. If there are any survivors down there, it's nothing short of a miracle. The Golden Gate Bridge is no more. Mr. Nolan, it's the president. Also, as you mentioned... You had the evidence, and you didn't contact me? You're right. I should have acted sooner. I'll take full responsibility. This isn't about blame. We need take a pro-active stance on this situation, and if this Dr. Hill believes we're still in danger, I want to hear it. I understand. Don't start second-guessing yourself. Be the man that I put in that position. Well, I've got to be honest with you, Mr. President. At this point, I don't know where to begin. Begin with your gut. We'll go from there. Dad, I'm starving. Yeah, me too, sweetheart. Here. Let's try up here. Are you getting anything on your radio? Wait. Hold on. Wait. Wait. I think I am getting something. The quake was measured at 9.2 in magnitude. Reports of missing people... San Francisco. Are still flooding in after the golden gate bridge collapsed. Most of downtown San Francisco was leveled. Both Governor Williams and Mayor Spaulding are believed to have been inside City Hall when it collapsed, burying all inside. They are still listed as missing. Oh, my God. Mom. Everything's going to be okay. Zoe. Did you reach your family in San Francisco? I told them to leave, but I haven't heard from anyone since. They're okay. They are. The phones are jammed. You may not hear from them for a while, but they will call. Dr. Hill? Mr. Nolan would like to talk to you. Right. They'll call. You warned me. I should have listened to you. Mr. Nolan, this isn't over. What we've experienced so far is nothing compared to what's still on the horizon. I'm listening. Since the quakes originated deeper than anyone thought, it's hard to place the exact hypocenter, but we can make an educated guess based on the areas of activity, specifically, the ones corresponding to these last three quakes. Let's follow the chain reaction. We started with a 7.9 outside the Seattle- Ellensburg area, to an 8.4 outside of Redding, and then this 9.2 in San Francisco. That leads us to our next rupture point. Here. The San Andreas fault? We could be looking at a seismic event larger than modern man has ever witnessed before. If this rupture occurs, it could take out the California coastline. How much time do you think we have? Factoring in the magnitude and space between these last three quakes, along with the intensity of the subsequent aftershocks, I think we're down to days. Days? I would love to see your data. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, please. Let her talk. There's nothing we can do to prevent the main fault from rupturing, but maybe we can stop it from interacting with San Andreas, causing an interruption, if you will. How do you propose to cause this interruption? We'd have to stabilize the fault line. And how would we do something like that? Fuse it. What? Fuse it? Technically, we could fuse the fault line if we generate enough heat. Melt the layers of sub-strata in the tectonic plates. And how on earth do we generate enough heat to do that? There's only one way I know of. A nuclear explosion. The heat generated from the nuclear explosions, positioned at just the right points, could fuse the fault line together. This is crazy. Okay, let her talk. Thank you. The main fault would still rupture, but the chain reaction would be interrupted, stopping at San Andreas. How do we find these points? We'd start by isolating the areas with the most activity along the fault line, and then choose the sites with the most risk of rupture. You're talking several nuclear explosions here. Have you stopped to consider that we might be dealing with radiation? Fallout? Among other things. We're all familiar with Nevada's nuclear testing program in the '50s. The blasts will be contained underground, and if we're careful, the surface damage should be minimal. And what if something goes wrong? Is there a risk? Absolutely... But if it works, we just saved 50 million lives. Are you sure? Yes, Mr. President. You want to use nuclear warheads? It's the only way to fuse the fault line. This has never been done before. What guarantees do we have that this will work? I wish I could give you some guarantees that this will work, Mr. President, but I can't. It's a long shot, Roy. I believe it'll work. I'm not comfortable with this sort of gamble. The stakes are just too high. What are the other options? If I had other options, believe me, I'd be presenting them now. You have no other contingency plans? Not in this situation, sir. Trust me. We've gone through every scenario imaginable, and none of them help. This seems like such an extreme measure. This is an extreme situation, Mr. President, extreme measures are needed. With all due respect, I need you to make this call now. We don't have time to analyze this. I'm just supposed to have blind faith in this theory? Well, Dr. Hill's been right so far. I see no reason why we should start doubting her now. I'll give you a call when I've made my decision. Yes, sir. From the devastating 9.2 quake which hit earlier this morning. Efforts to coordinate the massive emergency... Excuse me, Mr. President. California governor... Sir, I've just checked with the Pentagon. They can't confirm the safety of this plan. With all due respect, Mr. President, it is outrageous. Outrageous is all that we have left. We're out of alternatives. If this works, it could save millions of lives. May I speak frankly, sir? Please do. I know Mr. Nolan is a very good friend of yours... What I mean to say is, are you letting your relationship with him affect your judgment in any way, sir? I trust Roy. You would risk the possibility that these nuclear warheads could complicate our current situation and cost us more lives? What are you suggesting? That we do nothing? I'd rather have faith in something and be wrong than have faith in nothing at all. Call Roy back. Tell him we're going with Dr. Hill's plan. I'm authorizing the evacuation of the entire West Coast... And the placement of warheads. Yes, sir. Set up a news conference. There has been a massive mobilization of troops along the West Coast, causing great concern across the country that something major... Many are speculating that the deployment of troops has something... The National Guard has been mobilized in some more heavily hit areas... The president is asking that all Americans work together in this time of crisis. Have been raised to an unusual level around the massive military operation, raising concerns that civilians... The White House has refused to give out any information before tonight's speech, raising the level of anxiety... Officials at the highest levels have neither confirmed nor denied the movement of nuclear warheads across the West Coast. At a time when the geographical future of the Western seaboard seems uncertain... The economical damage is still being tabulated, but many believe it may take years to get the area back on track. President Hollister's speech, set for tomorrow. Millions are hoping beyond hope... Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States of America. Over the last day, our Western seaboard has experienced three devastating earthquakes. These natural disasters have shaken the foundations of our cities, towns, and other rural areas. Federal relief has been given, and you have my word that more help is on the way. Now, we have reason to believe that another major population is at risk. If we are correct in our assumptions, then the entire Southern California area will be hit by a fourth, and potentially catastrophic earthquake that could have a domino effect on the entire coastline. We must decide, as a nation, how we're going to handle this crisis. Are we going to allow this earthquake to shake the foundations of our spirit, our community, and the ties that bind us all together? Or are we going to come together as a nation, neighbor helping neighbor, until each and every person is safe from harm? I believe in my heart that we have the strength and courage to survive this calamity... Together. Join me now as we face this challenge... And God bless you all. This is the third quake in a row, each increasing in magnitude... It is feared that tens of thousands may be buried... Governor? Rachel? I'm sorry... I can't feel my legs. I can't feel my legs! It's okay, Rachel, it's... Okay. It's okay. Where else do you hurt? I just feel cold. I feel cold. It's okay. It's okay, Rachel. It's all right. It's all right, it's all right. It's okay, Rachel. It's okay. It's bad, isn't it? It's not good, Rachel. It's not good. Stay with me. Rachel. Rachel, stay with me. Rachel, focus. Rachel, Rachel, Rachel... Focus. Focus. It's going to be okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa! 5.6! It's an aftershock. It's subsiding. Owen. Yeah? Maybe you should think about getting your family out of here. What about you? I'll stick around, I'll help evacuate the people. I don't think I could live with myself, leaving these people behind. Cover me? How are you today? In light of the tragedies along our Western seaboard, he has declared martial law, and authorized the evacuation of the entire West Coast. The details were not given, but the president suggested that the Los Angeles area may be next in a string of deadly earthquakes that continue to threaten... The entire Western seaboard. Hello? It's me, baby. Did you see the news? I can't believe this is happening. I'm scared, Owen. It's hard to believe we were fighting over a car just yesterday. Seems like another lifetime ago, doesn't it? What were we thinking? I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry for everything I said. We have been acting childish, haven't we? I know I have. I'm sorry, too. You've got to get moving, Jill. What about you, Owen? What are you going to do? I'm going to stay and help evacuate. No! No, Owen! We're not going to go anywhere without you. It's going to be all right. You can just get that out of your head. We're not going. It's going to be all right. You've got to trust me on this one. Owen... I'll see you soon, all right? That's a promise. Okay, okay, I'll start packing... Don't worry about all our stuff. You can buy more stuff. Just... Just pack up what you need and get out. Okay. Okay. I love you, baby. I love you. Owen... The entire west coast is being evacuated east of Barstow in Southern California and Fresno in Northern California. It is asked that the people in these evacuated areas take only what they can carry. Tamika, Calvin... Stop it. Give it to me. Give them to me, I said. What's wrong, mom? Nothing, nothing is wrong. I just need you two to settle down, okay? Can you do that for mommy? Sit down. Just... I'm sorry... We didn't mean to upset you. It's not your fault, baby. Okay. Now, listen to me... I need you to pack. We're going to be leaving the house for a while. What? Where are we going? Someplace safe, baby. Well, aren't we safe here? Just go pack, okay? Go on, go help your sister. Thank you for joining us and giving us the latest update on that. We will return in just a moment with another update on the relief center operations. Oh, God, help me! All right, all right, all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We're not going to get out of here. I don't believe that. I don't believe it. You're not going to die, Rachel, trust me. It's okay. Somebody's going to find us. It'll be okay. I had a fight with Jimmy this morning. And he tried to talk to me before this happened... And I didn't take his call. If I could just take it all back, and tell him I'm sorry... "I'm sorry, baby. " If I could just tell him that I love him, and that I want to have a family with him... Rachel... You're going to see Jimmy... You're going to see Jimmy very soon, and you can tell him all of these things you just told me, okay? Okay. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you... Rachel, Rachel... Rachel, stay with me. Rachel? Rachel! Rachel, stay with me! Please! Rachel. Look at me. You can do it. Stay with me... Mr. Nolan, your son's here to see you. Zack? I need to talk to you, Dad. What the hell are you still doing here? Hospital needs my help to move people out. You need to leave this city. Now! Why? What is happening? Talk to me, dad. It's the worst-case scenario. Listen, I'll arrange for a helicopter to get you out. No, I can't just leave my patients behind. Don't argue with me, Zack. What is going to happen to all the people who don't get evacuated out of here? What happens to them? We're doing everything we can to get them to safety. But it's not going to be enough, right? How many casualties? And I want the real numbers, dad. Don't give me the press numbers. Millions. I can't leave, then. I don't know if you're being stubborn or just ignorant. Why, because I'm refusing to bury my head in the sand? Sorry, dad. Not all of us have problems facing the truth. What the hell is that supposed to mean? I think you know exactly what that means. Let's drop it. Why are you avoiding me? I don't have time for this right now. How many times have I seen you since mom died? Did I do something to offend you? We're finished here. Recon four, we're four klicks South of delta-lima-foxtrot-seven. Over. Go ahead, Mr. Nolan. You're on with Dr. Hill. I don't know about this terrain. Are you sure we can't set up about two miles south? The drill sites need to be exact. We're manipulating the rupture points. Just wish we had a little more elbow room. Do you think you can pull it off? Oh, I know we can. The question is, can we pull it off in time? Copy that. We've arrived and we're setting up now. Over. Roger that. We've got a tight timeline, so let's keep going. Okay, come on, people, let's go. Come on. We don't have all night. We've got a lot of work to do. Dr. Hill, how deep do we have to be? The warhead needs to be 324 feet below the surface at this site. Well, that's easier said than done. We're drilling through layers of bedrock. I wish there were an easier way. That's where the plates conjoin. We'll get it done. Mr. Nolan. We're at 200 feet. Keep drilling. They've got 200 feet. What have you got? Okay, everybody. Listen up. We're going to first clear rooms 1 through 22, followed by 23 through 44, and then 45 through 85. After that, we can move on to the 100s. I want everybody that can walk on their own to go first, followed by those in the wheelchairs, and then the patients in the gurneys. All right? Let's move. Owen, pediatrics is all clear. You're sure? Checked the whole wing myself. All right, let's get these patients out of here. Let's do it. Coming through, coming through. Let's take it back a couple inches. All right? I'm good this side. All right, easy. We're clear. All right over here. Take it out. We're unloading the warhead now. Okay. Get it in place. More! That's it! That's it. It's secure, Dr. Hill. Take it up. All right, take it up. All right, gentlemen. Arming cable is attached, sir. Give it a sec. Keep it clear. Keep it clear. There's no turning back now. Let's just hope this works. We're losing the jetty. 270 feet. 275 feet. We are at target depth. Set it down. Okay, cap it off. Back it up. Keep going. Keep going. Dump it. Okay, guys, let's seal it off. Let's go, let's go, let's go. The shaft is sealed, Mr. Nolan. Prepare to set the warhead. Yes, sir. Standing by, sir. Sir, can you take a look at this? Initiating it now. There's still unnatural frequencies. I got it. Locked in. Switching remote detonation capability over to you, Dr. Hill. I don't know if I'm ready to do this. Me either. On my count. Three, two, one... Turn. God help us. We're good to go, Mr. Nolan. One down. Five more to go. Next location, here we go. Governor Williams' office. Oh, my God, oh, my God. I got through. I got through. Yes, yes, this is Amanda, Governor Williams' daughter? Is... No, no, no, no. Hello? Hello? Damn it! Sweetheart, sweetheart. It's okay, it's okay. Sweetheart... We're going to get through this thing. We made it this far, right? Come on, let's just keep walking. Hey, I've got somebody here! Joe, give me a hand. Let's go! Let's move it! She's alive! We are presently flying over the freeways of Los Angeles, and it is an unprecedented sight. All roads are leading out of the city. Obviously, many people are evacuating to the evacuation camps on the borders of Nevada and Arizona. People are grabbing... What about dad? He'll meet up with us later. Dad's not coming? Not yet, baby. He still has work to do, helping people. What kind of people? Sick people, okay? People that can't help themselves. Grab that bag. People at the hospital? That's right. People at the hospital. Now, get in. Get in. Calvin, buckle up. Mom, are we going to die? No, honey, of course not. Why would you say something like that? I saw something on TV... You just forget about what you saw on TV. Okay? Now, the only thing that matters is right here, right now. All right? Mama's not going to let anything happen to you, okay? Let's go. Excuse us, please. Clear it out! Excuse us. Have you seen my husband? I don't know where your husband is, ma'am. I'm looking for my husband. I already tried that! I'm sorry. We need help over here! What's the status on Governor Williams? How is she? She's alive, but still listed in critical condition, sir. That's the good news. The bad? We can't get the people out of the cities fast enough. Then bring in more helicopters, more trucks, whatever it takes. Mr. President, we have tapped all of our resources. If the National Guard is not enough, then activate enlisted servicemen. They've all been activated, sir. The reserves? We are fully deployed. Then come up with something else. We will save those people. Mr. President, at some point we have to face the inevitable. And what is that, Daniel? That some things are just out of our hands. I don't believe that. Keep trying. Mr. Nolan has arrived. We're arriving at site number three. We're halfway home, Dr. Hill. Down. Ease it in. Switching remote detonation capability over to you, Dr. Hill. Got it. What's the status of our warheads? They've placed three of the warheads. Are they having any problems? Not to my knowledge, sir. If they have any setbacks, I want to know immediately. We can't afford any delays at this point. Understood, Mr. President. Governor? Governor, are you awake? How are you feeling? What happened? Just relax. You've suffered a concussion to your head. You broke your left leg. Where's Rachel? Just lie back, lie back. But where's Rachel? Rachel... Rachel didn't make it. She saved my life, Donna. They did everything that they could for her. I need to talk to her husband, Jimmy. I took the liberty of telling him that you were going to call when you felt better, okay? My family, Donna. I need you to find my family. Your daughter called in earlier today. She did? What did she say? We lost the connection... But the fact that she called tells us that they're okay. Okay? So you just have to rest now. Just relax, okay? I'm sorry for bringing you out here, Amanda. I should have been better prepared, sweetie. I screwed up. I've screwed up everything with you. I... I... I can't seem to get us right. Dad, that's not true. Yeah, it is. I should have stuck it out with your mom. I should have made that work. I'm sorry for the whole thing. Dad... You don't have to apologize to me, okay? The important thing is that you're here with me now, and that's all that matters, okay? Now, come on. We have to keep moving. We have to go. You turned out pretty good, Mandy... With or without me. Dad, wait... Do you hear that? I think it's a car! Yeah, I hear it. I can't tell which way it's coming from. It's coming from over there. Let's go! Hello! Hey, wait! Stop! Hello! Mandy, wait, wait. Hello! Where is it? It's that way. Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on, I saw it. Hey! Hey! Wait! Wait! Stop. Hold up. Stop the truck! Thank God. You got room for two more? Sure, hop in. Okay... Hi. Right here you see I-10, and people are abandoning their vehicles. It is a spectacular sight. The military... Everyone's out. I've got two criticals. You want to come with me? Yeah. Sounds good. Clear a path, please. We're coming through. We've got a critical coming through. Everything's going to be okay, sir. We're almost there. Help me get this guy on the truck. What are you doing? Please, please! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Please, you've got to give me a ride! It's my family. Please! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's patients only. Please, let me on the truck! How are we all doing back here? Everyone okay? Are we going to get out of here? Sure we are. It's just going to be another moment. Where are you taking us? How does barstow sound? Barstow? What's in barstow? They have an emergency evacuation center set up. We're all going to be safe there. Thank you. Let me in! Hey, what's the hold up here? This city's going to blow. We're not going to make it out before the quake. We're going to die in this parking lot. Come on, people, just stay cool, and we'll all get out of here. See? We're on our way already. What's happening out there, Donna? The president has ordered an evacuation of the entire west coast. Oh, my God... There's a strong possibility of more quakes. How much time to do we have? The usgs can't tell us for sure. Now, their guess is less then 24 hours. They'll never get the people out in time. Please, governor. Everything that can be done, we're doing. We have the National Guard, the Highway Patrol, the local law enforcement. They're all working to keep the traffic flowing eastward. It's not going to be enough. What about the trains? We could use freight and commuter cars... It's already done. The airports? We can increase the flights. Open military airports... It's done. Cruise and freight ships... We could... Carla, Carla, please, please. We are doing everything that we can. Oh, come on, now! Damn. Status? We lost another drill bit. Earl, get a backup in here, now! It's on its way, sir. How far down are we? We're about 273 feet. Let's move! Dr. Hill... It's solid layers of rock all the way down. We've gone through three drill bits already. Keep trying. We have to be at a depth of 432 feet on this fault line. It's critical. We'll do what we can, Dr. Hill. Where are we? About 200 feet left to go. How much time do we have? Maybe a couple hours. You should probably get some rest, Sam. I can't. You'll run yourself ragged. There's a cot in the other room. I tried it out for you. It's not bad. I'm good. I'll wake you up if anything happens. How's that? Promise? I promise. All right. Thank you. Also, as you mentioned, there are so many people that have been affected that these relief sites might very well be overwhelmed with the amount of people that will be trying to find some sort of refuge there. Is there any particular... Mr. President, the tent cities are filling up, sir. How close are we to full capacity? We've already passed it, sir. Then we have to make it bigger. Sir? Get me the governor of Nevada. Hey, Dad? Yeah, honey? Did you ever meet anyone? What's on your mind, Amanda? I don't know. After you and mom? No. No girlfriends? One-night stands? This is not exactly the kind of conversation you have with your daughter. Yeah, you're right. Never mind. I shouldn't have asked. No. Really? Really. Why? Guess I never really got over your mom. Do you still love her? Yeah. Well, why did you leave her? Mom says it's because you're jealous of her job. No, Amanda, believe me, I have... I have no interest in being governor. Well, then, why? Because I was scared. What's to be scared of? Change. Thought she'd become someone else? Sounds kind of stupid, doesn't it? No, dad, it doesn't sound stupid. But F.Y.I.? She didn't. I'm beginning to see that. Here we go. Oh, my... Look at this place. And the people are still coming in by the thousands. Local, federal, and military resources appear to be strained as people from everywhere work together in this crisis to evacuate. The scene here can only be described as controlled chaos. Cars and trucks keep flooding in by the hour, bringing in more and more families. Despite the numbers, there is a spirit of camaraderie, of family, throughout the camp as everyone tries to pitch in and make this impossible situation work. Keep moving. Keep moving. God, look at all these people. And still the people continue to come by carload, by busload, by truckload... Keep moving. Sir, we need to use a phone. All the lines are down, except for official channels. Excuse me. Sir, my wife is Carla Williams, the governor of the State of California. We really need to find out if she's okay. There's a communications center about 50 meters down. They'll be able to help you out, sir. Thank you. Come on, keep moving! All circuits are busy. Please try your call again. I'm sure Jill and the kids made it. Yeah. Try them again. I've been trying. Too many people on their cells right now. Do you want to wait around here and see if you can find them? Nah. Patients need us, right? It's okay, Owen. I can't bail on you. Yes, you can. I can do this alone. Owen, it's your family, man. You've got to go. Go. Get out of here. Go. You sure? Yeah. Don't start with that cowboy thing. Don't try and be a maverick, Zack. Yeah, I'll work on it. Thanks, Zack. No problem. Jill? Calvin? Tamika? Sorry. You want some water? Jill? Jill! Excuse me, I'm looking for a Jill Hunter. She should have signed in with my son and daughter, Calvin and Tamika. Just a second. Hey, buddy, wait your turn. It's a line-up, you know. Hey, where you think you're going, man? They should have signed in hours ago. Sir, I've got people in front. I'm a doctor. I need to find them right away. Check the block assignment tables, over there. Thank you. Sorry. Next, please. Step forward. Hi, there. Could I ask you for a favor? I need to speak to Roy Nolan, the head of FEMA. He's my father. Dr. Fisher? There's a radio call for Mr. Nolan. Who is it? It's his son. All right, transfer it over. Hello? Hi, there. I need to speak to my father. I'm Zack Nolan. I'm sorry, he's not here right now. He's in the field. Okay, um... Can you tell me where? I really need to speak to him. Where are you? You in Barstow? Yes, I am. Yes. Tell you what. I will get a message to him. I'll tell him that you called, okay? Okay, thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you. What's wrong? It's so surreal, Jordan. I can't even think anymore. I know the feeling. It's been a whirlwind since this started, and then I... Just paused for a second, and it all just crept up on me. What if I'm wrong? Don't start second-guessing yourself now, Sam. What if people lose their lives because of me? Your plan's the only solution. It's the only one that works. I want to believe that, but I don't know. Well, we do our best, and the rest is fate. That's not good enough. Look... At some point, you're going to have to let it go, Sam. Even if you could predict every single earthquake... You can't save everyone. I know. You have to let it go. Can I get a hand over here, please? Excuse me, I'm looking for major Hamilton. Thank you very much. Major Hamilton? Yeah? I'm an E.R. surgeon named Zack Nolan. Can I help you? Yeah, absolutely. We're running heavy triage here. That means "set limits. " Are you familiar with that? Uh, refresh my memory. Priority one is stop the bleeding and keep them breathing... Everything else can wait. Okay, gotcha. If you think your patient will take over three hours, pump him full of morphine, and give him to God. Let him die? Can you do that? Yeah. Hi. I'm Dr. Nolan. How are you doing today, sir? You just hang in, all right? Hey. How's everything? You saved my family's lives. My brother just called me from Phoenix. If you hadn't predicted that quake... They would've died. I don't know how to thank you. It's okay. Jimmy, I know you've already heard the news about Rachel. I'm... I'm so sorry. I know this is devastating for you. I can't imagine how painful it must be... But I was with Rachel when the building collapsed. She saved my life, Jimmy. She wanted me to give you a message. What did she say? She wanted me to tell you that she was sorry about the fight you two had had, and that if she could take back all the things that she said to you before she left, she would... And that she loved you very much. She just... She just wanted you to know that. Right here. What's your problem, man? Excuse me, excuse me. Sir, sir, sir. Can I help you? I'm looking for my family. Well, I need to see your registration. I didn't have time to register. Well, then, I can't let you pass. You'll just have to stop me, won't you? Sir, hey! Jill! Jill! Daddy! You made it! Of course I made it. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You okay? God, I missed you two. Keep the pressure on that, okay? Dr. Nolan. Yeah? We have two more cranial injuries coming in. Okay, bring them in. That looks like a four-hour job to me. Well, maybe for you, it is a four-hour job. For me, it's a half-an-hour job. Bring them in. I'll be ready. You better be sure. Wouldn't have said it if I wasn't. We're placing the last warhead. How are we on time? It's difficult to tell at this point. Whoa, hey, look out, look out, look out! Tell me this is an aftershock! It's not an aftershock. It's starting! All right, we need to stay calm. You have to get that last warhead in place. I know, I know. Give him a hand! We lost the warhead. Unit two, unit two, come in. Sergeant, requesting instructions. It looks to be only about half-way down the shaft. The warhead needs to be 324 feet below the surface at this site. It's a couple hundred feet down. That's not optimal. I don't think we can get to it. Keep trying. Oh, no... What's wrong? The arming cable's been severed. We can't arm it from up here. Sergeant, get everybody out of here. Can we do without it? No. No, we need all those warheads to go off at the same time. Otherwise, the explosion will be localized, exponentially increasing the damage. We'll just have to live with that depth. Can we arm it manually? Mr. Nolan, this is major Bennet. Yes, there is a manual override on the bomb hull. Can you walk me through the arming process? You'd have to go down there. Mr. Nolan... Mr. Nolan, you won't have enough time to escape the blast radius. Just answer the question. Can you walk me through this? Yes. I'm going in. Let's move it out. All right, good. That's good. Come on, hurry up! Okay, get out of here. But, sir... Go! Mr. Nolan? Mr. Nolan! I'm here. Still descending. Let us know when you get close. Will do. I'm right on top of it. All right, I'm there. Mr. Nolan, first I need you to open the panel. Done. You should see three switches... Yes. Done. Do you see the L.E.D. Display? Yes. I need you to punch in this code... Zero-niner-niner... Zero... Nine... nine... Charlie-Alpha... Charlie-Alpha... Five-niner-niner... Five-nine-nine... Romeo-Oscar... Seven... Mr. Nolan? Mr. Nolan, are you there? Mr. Nolan? I'm pinned down. I'm stuck against the wall, about two-thirds down the shaft. I can't complete the sequence. Damn it! I can't reach it. It's okay, Mr. Nolan. Stay calm. Just take it slow and easy. We can do this. Damn it. I'm sorry. It's not your fault, Mr. Nolan. We'll think of something else. Damn it. We need to call the president. Roy. I blew it, Paul. No, you didn't blow it. Don't give up on me now, Roy. No offense, sir, but... I had a little run-in with a nuclear warhead down here. Looks like it won. How bad is it? Well, I dropped the ball, sir. No, Roy... You're just down by two. What do you mean, Paul? Do what you do best. Make the long shot. Not this time, friend. Not this time. Is there anything I can do for you, Roy? Yes. Just one request. Name it, buddy. Dr. Nolan? Zack Nolan. Here. Can you come with me, please? Why? What's wrong? It's your father. Close him. Dad? Dad, it's Zack. Can you hear me? Zack? Yeah. Hey, what happened? What's going on? Well... I had a little accident down here. What kind of accident? The kind you don't walk away from, son. Is it... Zack, I need you to be strong right now. There are a lot of people that are depending on you, just like they were depending on me. I hope you're out of the L.A. area, Son. I'm in Barstow. Good. Good. I didn't think you'd listen to me. You're stubborn as hell, you know that? You got that from your mother. Really? Because I thought I got it from you, you know? Dad? Dad? Can you hear me, dad? Zack, you still there? Yeah, yeah, I'm here, dad, I'm here. Uh... I miss your mother, Zack. I've missed her for so long, I got used to it. Never let yourself get used to missing someone. It makes you numb. It kills a part of your soul. I wanted to be there for you, Son, but... every time I would look at you, I'd see her. I was so busy thinking about what I lost... I couldn't see what I had. I should have said this a long time ago, but... I love you, Son. I know you do, Dad. Zack, take care of those people. Dad, wait for a second, okay? Dad, are you there? Can you hear me? We lost the connection. It's happening! Dad, I love you too. What do you want to do, Sam? Let's go ahead. The last one isn't armed or at the right depth. We have to take our chances. Activate the sequence. The warheads are armed. Begin the countdown. Are we ready? On your command, Dr. Hill. Fire warhead number one. Fire warhead number one. Fire warhead number two. Fire warhead number two. Fire warhead number three. Fire warhead number three. Fire warhead number four. Fire warhead number four. Fire warhead number five. Oh, my God! Nolan did it. It's going to go! Three points. I got you. I got you, Son. Don't worry about it. 5.6. 5.3. 4.7. 4.2. 3.6. 3.2. 1.8. It's stabilizing. It's stabilizing. What happened? I don't know. 0.7. 0.2. Zero movement. It's holding. The San Andreas fault... Is stable. No further signs of disruption. You did it, Sam. It worked. It actually worked. We interrupted the chain reaction! It's stable. The fault line is stable. Congratulations. Well done, Roy. Well done. What's wrong, Sam? Look right here. Those are aftershocks. Then why aren't they decreasing in magnitude? Congratulations, Dr. Hill. You're a hero. Uh, Mr. President, I'm not entirely sure that this is completely behind us. What do you mean? Did we or did we not avert this disaster? Well, Northern California, Washington, and Oregon, are almost certainly out of harm's way. That's 60 million people you're talking about. That's incredible news. I'm not so confident about Southern California. The San Bernardino warhead was only at a depth of 200 feet or so. It went off, didn't it? Yes, it did, but it needed to be another 200 feet down to be optimally effective. I'd feel a lot more comfortable confirming this before we start letting people come back. How much time do you need? Another 24 hours. I just need to make sure the fault is stable. You've got your 24 hours, Dr. Hill. I'll be waiting for your call. Thank you. I've got another internal bleeder. I need 10 minutes. 10 minutes. That's five hours of surgery. I need 10 minutes and I can save him. You know the rules. You have to let him go. I cannot just let him go. I will not let him go. Dr. Nolan, you have to make a choice. I can't make that choice and I won't. You've got to make a decision. I can, and I just need some help. I thought you'd never ask. I've got this one here. Owen! Sorry I took so long to find you. You're on with the governor. Oh, thank you. Mom? Mom? Oh, baby, I am so happy to hear your voice. Me too, Mom. Are you okay? I'm better now. Where are you? We're outside of Barstow in one of the evacuation camps. Thank God. Is your dad with you? Yeah, Dad's right here, and he's fine. Good. Some camping trip, huh? Yeah... It's five-star hotels for me now. How have you and dad been getting on? We're good, Mom. We are good. Wow, is this my Amanda I'm talking to? Yes. Yes, it is. Hi, Carla. Hi, Clark. Clark... Yeah? There's so many things I want to tell you. Me too, Carla. Me too. We can't get any closer without risking radiation. Let's circle around that Ridge and take another reading. Something here doesn't make sense. What are our coordinates? 34 degrees, 51 minutes north by 116 degrees, 47 minutes west. Jordan, get me a map of this area. What are you thinking, Sam? This can't be. Why? What's wrong? That's supposed to be the Kern River. Can I get a confirmation on our coordinates? Kern river? Yes, Dr. Hill. It's the Kern River. Where are you going with this, Sam? The Kern River is supposed to drain into the Whitewater Reservoir. Which way is the Whitewater Reservoir? Uh, let me see here. It's south of you. Yeah? And? This river's flowing north. It's supposed to be going south. It changed direction? How's that possible? I don't know. How does this relate to our rupture spot? I don't know, magnetic pull? I've never heard of magnetic pull affecting a river. Ocean waves, yeah, but not the direction of a river. Jordan, just give me a minute here, please. This isn't right. God, look! What the hell's going on, Sam? The quake disrupted the water table? That quake disrupted more than the water table... It opened up the fault line. So then the river... Is draining into the fault line. That's why it changed directions. Which is why the San Andreas fault activity isn't decreasing. The explosion wasn't deep enough to fuse the fault line. It's rupturing as we speak. Pull a thermo-map of the Redding quake area. Why? What's happening? Just do it. The plates are moving. Patch me into the White House. You're sure? You're absolutely positive? Yes, Mr. President. The fault line affecting Southern California is still unstable. The San Bernardino warhead wasn't deep enough when it went off. We need to keep the evacuation moving east. We need to get everybody out of there. It's only a matter of time. How much time? We could be looking at hours. It could be minutes. How big do you think this quake could be? I believe it will change the geography of Southern California, sir. I understand. Thank you, Dr. Hill. I want all of our resources focused on this evacuation. Everything we have. Just keep those people moving out of there. Yes, sir. Dr. Hill, Dr. Fisher, follow me. You can set up your command center in the communications tent. If we just had more time. Sam, Sam... Come on, let it go. It's over. I can't. Sam... Please, let it go. You've done all you can. Owen, you sure you don't want to go be with Jill and the kids right now? Yeah, I want to be with them, but she wants me to be with you, and one thing I've learned in our marriage is I give the lady what she wants. Guys, we've got another critical coming in. Oh, okay, I'm on it. Are you sure? Trust me, he's sure. Okay. Hey, Owen, thanks for helping. Thanks for asking for it. It's okay. Everyone, just stay calm. This is it. U.S. Geological Service reporting massive seismic activity in Southern California. The San Andreas fault is opening up. The rupture has ripped through Los Angeles and is pushing eastward. 8.9, sir. Fissure eruptions throughout Southern California. Sam! Come on. Let's go this way. Sam? Hey, secure your patient. 9.2, sir. The rupture has reached 25 miles east of Los Angeles, devastating Pomona, Ontario... Let's get everybody ready to evacuate. Stay calm. I'm afraid, Mommy. Don't worry. Mommy's not going to let anything happen to you. Hang on to me. U.S. Geological Service reporting. The chasm continues to widen, now 45 miles east... It's 9.8 and growing in magnitude. 9.9. The rupture is 60 miles east of Los Angeles, moving in a north/northeasterly... 10 and still climbing. All right, that's it, Owen. We can't do anything anymore. Go be with your family. Yeah. Be careful, Zack. Keep going. Go! Dad! The rupture has reached Barstow. The evacuation centers are in danger. The San Gabriel valley is flooded. Oh, my God! Jill! Jill! Come on, let's go! All right. Has reached the evacuation center. It's cutting tent city in half. God help us now. It's still climbing. Oh, my God... 10.5! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan, the water! Sam! Sam! I'm coming. Hold on to me. Grab my arm. Hold on. Come on! Come on. Run! Jordan, come on! Come on, get up! Get up. Come on! We've got to go! Come on! Come on... Oh, my God. It stopped... It's over. I think it's over. Wow. Yeah... wow. It's over. It's finally over, sir. Though this event was a tragedy, it was also a wake-up call. We are not the masters of this planet. We're just one of the many species that have inhabited this place that our ancestors call Mother Earth. And though our cities and buildings may fall, as long as we hold true to the virtues sacred to every one of us, as long as we have faith and the will to prevail, we will endure.
