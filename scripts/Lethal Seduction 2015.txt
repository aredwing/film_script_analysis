Yeah, the girl gains 15 pounds in her first year of college, right? What? No, the 15 stands for the 15 guys they must have sex with their freshman year. I'm pretty sure you're wrong about that. ( horn honks ) Hello, hello. What do we have here? Hey, babes, how's it going? We're going to a party. How would you lucky ladies like to be our dates? ( laughs ) The blonde was into me. Don't you think she was a little too old for us, dude? Dude, 40-year-olds are just teens with decades of experience. All right. What if they had said yes? They'd be pretty disappointed when they find out we didn't actually have a party to go to. Well, actually... Oh, man. Surprise! Sorry, man, I had to promise not to blab, you know. Happy birthday. Oh, there's my birthday boy. Make a wish. Maybe it'll come true. Yay! Sodas and pizza by the pool. Mark. Can you help me? Sorry, I, uh, need someone to tie the back of my top. Yeah, sure. Let me help you with that, sweetheart. Honey, why don't you go downstairs and help entertain the guests? - Oh! - There you go. He's on the Fulbright Fellowship Board and we've been pals forever. Boy, I can tell you some stories. Anyway, he's a good guy to know. I could give him a call if you'd like. ( audio blurs ) 'Cause you know what they say, it's not what they know, it's who you know. - Mark? - Uh, yeah, yeah, that'd be great. And Mark, if you need anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to call me. Actually, I was wondering... Yo! Have you seen Melanie's new bikini? Yeah. I'm gonna go see if your mom needs help. - Uh, okay, thanks again, Randy. - Who's that dweeb? Oh, he works with my mom at the aquarium... Cool, man. Anyway... Listen, here's the plan. Saturday night, get your mom out of the house. We raid your dad's liquor cabinet, invite over Melanie and whichever friend has the lowest standards. I don't know if those bottles are any good anymore. They haven't been touched in, like, 10 years. Dude, scotch doesn't go bad. It ain't like milk. Oh. I think everybody had fun, don't you? Uh-huh. Oh, the pizza was outstanding. No more Little Gino's. It is Brutelli's from now on. What did you think of your presents? Hello. Earth to Mark. Sorry, mom, I'm--I'm writing a really intricate line of code right now. But I had a great birthday, thank you. You know, there's a church social this weekend. I think there will be a lot of nice girls there. Maybe we should go check it out? Okay, Mom. Okay, well, happy birthday, baby. I hope you had fun. How we doing there, Mom? Mom? Almost ready. Thanks again for taking her out, Randy. Oh, happy to do so. Ta-da! You look incredible. Yeah, really, really pretty, mom. All right, we will be home before midnight. No worries, it's cool. - Don't worry about it. - All right, okay. I'll be fine. I am safe and sound right... We're clear. Okay. I feel the time has fallen Down on me like a rain And I know my days are numbered... Ever had a Harvey Wallbanger? Dude, that's all you got? My dad wasn't much of a drinker. How do you make an Old Fashioned? Not with peppermint schnapps and amaretto. - Okay. - I've got an idea. Get some ice cream. Ice cream? Yeah. Get some ice cream. Okay. I got mint chocolate chip. Your drinks, my ladies. These are really popular in France right now. Thank you. He watches those kinds of videos on his computer, hours. He clears the search history, but I know. You sneak through his laptop? Mark's a good kid. I mean, he's going through some-- some big changes in his life, lots of heavy stuff. And I just think that he's at that age where he needs some space. That's soft. Yeah, they're denim. Maybe he could use a male role model in his life. Do you know what, Randy? I couldn't agree more. You do. Mm-hmm. Oh, this is great because... So I made a phone call and I totally took care of it. Called who? ( doorbell rings ) What the hell is that? I don't know. - Hi. - Hey, Mark. Hey, Deacon Williams, my, uh, mom's actually not here right now. Oh, I'm here to see you, my boy, 'cause I understand you're heading off to college in the fall. Princeton. That's right. Uh, but this really isn't a good time. Your mother asked me to stop by and see if I could offer some wisdom or advice about the changes you're, uh... Oh, you have company. Yeah, just a few friends. Well, perfect 'cause I brought Bible trivia. You are my sunshine, my only sunshine ( humming ) So the Deacon said he had a wonderful time with you last night. I'm glad someone did. Mark, I need you to go to the hardware store and pick me up a new towel rack. The one I bought is the wrong size. Okay. And pick us up a couple of smoothies, my treat. Mmm. Oh, there you are. Excuse me, can you help me? What--what is GPM? I'm sorry. Do you work here? Um, no, but I--I think I can help you. Um, GPM is your flow rate, gallons per minute. Um, this has a--an eco-flow. It's 1.5 GPM. It'll save you money, but there's no... There's no oomph. Exactly. Now, uh, my mom has this massager. It's got a strong pulsating spray and I don't-- she swears by it. Is your mother single? Yeah. Then, this will do just fine. Thank you. Hey, what's your name? What? Excuse me? I'm Carissa Kensington. And you are? Uh, Mark. Mark Richards. Well, thank you for your assistance inside, Mark. No problem. I'm just terrible at this handyman stuff. Probably put it in and it'll still leak. Oh, well, they make them pretty intuitive nowadays. You might have to seal the pipe with plumber's tape. Well, actually, I was hoping you could do me a really big favor and install it for me. Would you mind? I--I live just up the hill. Uh, well, I--I'm supposed to go back and help my mom. I'll pay you for your time. Princeton, wow. You must've gotten good grades. Uh, valedictorian. Yeah, I got a full scholarship, actually. Wow, impressive. All I ever did was party with my friends through high school. You know what that'll get you. Uh, what? An Arizona State degree and a very rich ex-husband. Well, it seems to be working now. Hmm. Better make sure. Would you care to test it with me? Try it before the hot water runs out. Get back in there, dude. She's waiting for you. Go. Now. I won't bite. Unless you want me to. Where have you been all day? Just out. Hmm. Did you put up that towel rack for me yet? I'm about to. These are pretty. Why are you so giddy today? Am I? No reason. Just a good day, I guess. Oh, I invited Wally over. I hope you don't mind. No, I don't... Liar, liar, liar! No, it's true. Three times, I'm telling you. It was incredible. - Liar! - No, it finally happened. I feel like a 5,000 pound weight was just lifted off me. Okay, so what's this hot, rich make believe nympho's name? Carissa Kensington. Yep, it's totally a fake name. And how old is she? - Like, 40. - 40? You're the one that said that banging a 40-year-old's like doing it with two 20-year-olds. Yeah, I know I said that, but what about Melanie? I don't know. I'm with Carissa now. She's taking me out. What? Yeah. Mom, have you seen my phone? Check your jeans. Watch out. Three in a row. Did you find it? Yeah, it was in my pants. Wow. Don't you look nice. Where are you off to tonight? Going out on a date. Oh. With that, uh, Melanie girl? No, with someone else. - Who? - Someone else. ( clears throat ) Mark, um, if you're not going to tell me who you're going on a date with, then you can't use the car. I don't need the car. - ( car honks ) - Gotta go. I'm just gonna... Yeah. Huh. That's a nice car for a high school student. Uh, computer science for information management systems. So you want to be like one of those IT guys? The nerd patrol that'll come in and fix your laptop? More like a software developer. Hmm, interesting. Can't believe they didn't card me. Tell me more about this computer program. Oh, well, I've been working on this app for the past year. My little man. Made it for my mom for after I leave for college. It's a cross between a lifestyle app and a personal assistant for mothers. How to reset the universal remote control. Yeah, it's supposed to help with everyday tasks and problems. Uh, for example, how much chlorine to put in the pool or where do I find my car in the parking lot. How to install a shower massager? Exactly. I think it's a million dollar idea. I love it. - Really? - I do. In fact, I actually have a friend who works at Intel Digital Labs. Oh, IDL, yeah, they're huge. I can see him being quite interested. That'd be awesome. Now, if I do this, I expect something big in return. I need to go powder my nose. I'll be right back. Run, kid, run. Sorry, you talking to me? Get out while you still can. Trust me, she's bad news. I paid the check. Ready? Yeah. You know how to work a stick? Sure. Good. So do I. I suppose since you are all of 18 years old that I don't need to know who you were out with until 12:15 AM, but I would appreciate a call that lets me know you're okay. Mark, I was worried to death. Sorry. I understand that you're almost out of the house and you need your space, but I worry about you. You haven't been acting like yourself lately. I just want to make sure you haven't fallen in with the wrong crowd. Wrong crowd? Seriously, nobody's doing drugs. - Marijuana's a drug. - I'm not smoking pot. Cocaine? Is that why you're so happy and full of energy lately? No. I gotta go. Put your bowl in the sink, young man. Um, I--I'm gonna pick up some chicken after work. Will you be home for dinner? No, probably not. These suits are pretty expensive. Don't worry. You'll work it off. Can you have it ready by tomorrow? Sure. I'll put a rush on it. Thanks, Jim. Today, I thought we'd hang by the pool. And I bought you these. Though you probably won't be wearing them much. ( chuckles ) This house is amazing. What does your ex-husband do? He used to be a broker. What does he do now? Worm food. I'm sorry. Whatever... That's okay. I thought you were divorced. Nope, trophy widow, five years now. Sorry. That's okay. Hey, want to rub some lotion on my back? Yes, please. This place is incredible. What's in that shed over there? Oh, that's my torture chamber. I'm kidding. It's an outdoor sauna. That's nice. Mark? Markie, you in there? Mom, a little privacy. I'm using the bathroom. - ( water running ) - Okay. I'll wait. ( shower running ) Okay, you're just being ridiculous. ( clears throat ) Really? It's too much to pick up our own clothes. Carissa? ( heavy breathing ) ( shouts ) ( screams ) ( doorbell rings ) Could somebody please get that? Yeah, I'm on it. Hi, sweetie. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, did you not get my text? I--I thought we were skipping tonight. Well, I--I... Hi, please--please come on in. Mark. You must be Tanya. - Hi. - Hi. - This is for you. - Thank you. Um, who are you? I'm Carissa. Kensington. ( Tanya clears throat ) Huh, hmm. Mm, this wine is really good, Carissa. Oh, thank you. It's my favorite Bordeaux. Duax Melon. Oh, that's strong. Better. The steak is delicious. Not bad if I say so myself and I do. So, um, Tanya, have you tried that new app that your brilliant son here created? App? Mm-hmm. No, I don't believe I have, have I, Mark? Well, it was supposed to be a surprise. Yes, well, we are quite good with secrets and surprises now, aren't we? Well, it--it's very inventive. And who knows? If it takes off, he might be able to just skip college and start his very own fortune 500 company. Skip college? Hasn't Mark told you? He has a full scholarship to Princeton. Not exactly something you skip. Uh, no, I didn't mean to imply... Do you have any idea how hard it is to get into a school like that? Mom, she wasn't saying that... I'm speaking, young man. The hours he has put into studying, essays, the science fairs, the volunteer work. Would you really encourage him to just throw all of that away? Mom, I'm not throwing it all away. That's an incredibly irresponsible thing for you to suggest. No one's suggesting anything, mom. You're--Randy, can you help me out here a little? You really do have some nerve. Who do you think you are? Look, I'm sorry if I offended you. You're damn right, you offended me. And while we're at it, let me be very clear. I do not approve of whatever this is. Mom, I can tell you right now, this is... I'm speaking! Miss Kensington, my son may look like a man to you, but I assure you, he is just a boy. Well, with all due respect, Mrs. Richards, you're very wrong. He is very much a man. A man who's more than capable of making his own decisions. Don't you think it's about time you cut those apron strings? Your audacity astounds me. You may very well be the same age as me, but you are not his mother. You don't get to suddenly show up and start making decisions and passing judgment. Now, I don't know you, Miss Kensington, but it seems to me that you are simply a lonely middle-aged woman who is out to satisfy some sick, sexual thrill and I forbid you to drag my son into your perverse game. Boy, that mother of yours is a real piece of work. I'm sorry. She's just protective. Mother sharks aren't that vicious and they eat their young. Can you believe the nerve of that woman? The gall to suggest I'm too clingy? I'm the one letting him go clear across the country to go to college, aren't I? What would an 18-year-old boy want with a piece of work like that anyway, hmm? Goodnight, Mark. Hey, wait, wait. Are we good? Well, it's just really upsetting to know that when push comes to shove, you fail to come to my defense. I tried, she... Yeah, no, boys try, men do. A real man sees what he wants and he takes it. He doesn't ask permission from his mommy. You're right. Do you even know what you want, Mark? When that boy gets back here, I'm gonna sit his butt down. We are gonna have a conversation about this because I am not letting him out... ( car doors slam ) This is all I could find. Hope it's all right. Hi, handsome. Are you ready to try something a little more thrilling? Isn't that what we've been doing? Child's play. I'm talking about dangerous. Dangerous is my middle name. Oh, yeah? ( gasping ) That was intense. Don't do it, Tanya. Give him his privacy. He's a good kid. You should be more trusting. Darn it. Wow. Oh, my God. That's the way to wake up in the morning. You just know you're gonna have a good day. So what are we gonna do today? Your choice. Uh, you mean like what position or what room? I think we should take a breather. A breather, who needs a breather? Just a couple of hours. How about the beach? Oh, yeah, yeah, sex on the beach. That sounds cool. My God, you are insatiable. ( doorbell rings ) Are you expecting someone? No. Why don't you jump in the shower and get dressed? Okay. ( beep ) Yes? Hi, this is Tanya Richards, Mark's mother. Oh, this should be good. ( door buzzer ) I wanted to stop by on my way to work. I just think we got off on the wrong foot. So you're here to apologize? Well, I can't say I'm all right with you seeing my son, but, um, I believe we both have something in common. Is that so? We're both widows. Mm-hmm. I understand the loneliness and what you're going through and you know what it feels like to lose someone you care about and love so much. I do. But let's cut the crap. You're--you're here for Mark, right? You're gonna, uh, save your little boy from me? Mommy to the rescue? Excuse me? You're pathetic. Go home, Tanya, we're done here. Excuse me. We're not done here. I want to see my son. Get him right now. Listen, I don't like you. I don't like you one bit, Tanya. You're a self-righteous, condescending bitch who's afraid of letting her son grow up simply because she's afraid of being alone. You have no idea what you're talking about. Don't I? Mark is my son. I'm his mother. - Don't you... - Oh, please spare me the sentimental family bond crap. I came here to make amends. Clearly, that was a mistake. Mark's not an idiot. You know, in a couple of weeks, he's gonna toss you aside and then you'll be all alone. Possibly. Or more likely, after a month of me screwing his brains out day and night, I'll be able to convince him to do anything I want, including cutting you out of his life for good. Have a nice day. Whoa. Mm, smells good. Cream? Please. Mm, blueberry's my favorite. Almost as good as Mom's. You know, Mark, I was thinking, maybe you should move in. I've got this big house all to myself and, well, it would get you out from under your mother's prying eyes. Um, I don't know if that's such a good idea. Why not? Don't you like it here? Yeah, yeah, it's just my mom still needs me. And what's the point? Summer's over in a month. - Over? - Yeah. I'm gonna have to move all my stuff to go to college. I don't want to move it twice. You know, I think we should skip the beach today. I think you should go home. What did I say? Yo, this place is sick. Let's go. How many bedrooms and more importantly, how many bedrooms have you done it in? Just drive. So what'd you do? Did you eat all her high fiber yogurt? Did you TiVo over her episodes of "NCIS"? No. Did you ask her to take out her dentures when she wa... All I did was imply that we were having a summer fling. You don't tell that to a chick, especially one who's only got so many good years left. She wanted me to move in with her. To the Pleasure Dome? That's great. My mom would kill me. You gotta leave the nest at some point so what's a few weeks early? I think she's gonna break up with me. I got it. We buy her flowers and butterscotch toffees from the five and dime. Just shut the hell up. She's an evil, conniving, back-stabbing man-eating tramp. Randy, I'm worried about my son. I mean, he has no idea that he's under this vicious siren's spell. Siren? Yeah, is that a thing? Daughters of the Greek god, Achilles, mermaid-like creatures who seduce young sailors with song making them crash their ships on the rocky cliffs? Uh-huh, that's her. Anyway, I have got to find a way to snap Mark out of this trance. - Or... - Or what? Nothing. It's not my place. Oh, come on, Randy, of course it's your place. Clearly, what I'm doing is not working and you always tell me the truth. So what should I do? I think you should allow Mark to make his own mistakes. He's a good kid. All thanks to you. You're a loving, caring mother and he is the person he is because of you. But Tanya, you can't protect him from all the dangers of the world. Sometimes, you gotta let the baby get burned by the iron if he's ever gonna learn, get strong and, you know, grow up. Really? That's your big advice. What? How can you take that insane woman's side? No, I don't think I was... That is horrible advice. What kind of idiot lets a baby play with an iron? The next thing you'll be telling me is I drove him to her, that it's my fault. Unbelievable. I'm just thinking that if you wouldn't have made it so difficult for Mark to be independent, he might have stayed closer to home. Who knows, you know? Maybe he would've gotten together with that girl from the party. Melanie? The girl in the bikini. Hmm, well, anything's better than that woman. I'm gonna call and invite her over. No, Tanya, that's what I'm talking about. You're going about this all wrong. You're right. I'm gonna send her an email from Mark's email address. What? No! That's even... Thanks for the advice. Tanya! Oh, thank God. Hello. Hey, uh, I was getting worried. Did you get my texts? I did. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to say those things to upset you. No. I certainly don't want this to end. It's been the best time of my life. I really, really like you a lot. A whole lot. I know you do. So can I come over tonight? Gosh, do you think your mommy will let you? What does my mom have... I thought you were mad about me going to Princeton. Don't be silly. Of course I want you to go to college, Mark. But only if that's what you want. I fear you make all of your decisions based on what the queen decrees. Hey, I know she's intrusive. That's a very nice way of putting it. I'd use controlling or manipulative. That's not exactly fair. My mom's supportive and not as domineering as you make her out to be. Mark, downstairs. What was that? Uh, nothing. Right now! Is that your mother? No. Just hold on. What? Uh, you're really pretty friend Melanie's here to see you. Hi. Hey, sorry about that. Hey, Carissa? Okay, look, maybe you can come over. But you're gonna have to promise me... No, that's okay. Uh, my mom needs me for something. We can get together tomorrow? Are you sure? I--I'm gonna be up pretty late tonight. Tomorrow's fine. Gotta go. Bitch. That was very delicious, Mrs. Richards. It was my pleasure. And thanks for inviting me, Mark. Mm-hmm. So Melanie, where will you be attending college? I've been accepted at Columbia. Oh, an Ivy League school as well. You two will be close together. I have a really good idea. You should rent a moving truck and drive across country together. Don't you think that'd be kind of fun, Mark? Melanie, would you like some dessert? Uh, yeah, sure. Oh, I didn't make any. But you guys should go get some ice cream. You can take my car. My treat. It was lovely seeing you again, Melanie. You, too. And you two kids have fun. Stay out as long as you like. I'm sorry. It's okay. ( no audible dialog ) I had to revoke her Facebook privileges because she kept posting baby pictures on my wall. Wow. I thought my mom was bad. No, she means well. She just has no boundaries. Yeah. Sounds like she needs a hobby or a boyfriend. Actually, there's this guy she works with, Randy. You met him at my birthday party. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. He's a really cool guy. He used to be really good friends with my dad. Um, I like him, but the guy won't make a move to save his life. The hypocrisy is pretty thick out here, huh? Are you ever going to kiss me? Um, yeah. Yeah, I--yeah, I want to. I mean, it's just, uh, I've kind of been seeing someone. You have a girlfriend? Not exactly. It's--it's just like this little fling that's--oh, screw it. ( chuckles ) Let's go. Okay. ( chattering ) - So I'll call you tomorrow? - Cool. Okay. Goodnight. Goodnight. ( door opens ) You're home already. Yeah. Did you have fun? Yeah. What did you guys do? We went and had ice cream. Your treat. Um, we went to the beach and, I don't know, it was fun. ( radio blasts ) ( screeches ) Shh. Do you like her? Mom, we're just friends. Why? I mean, she's awfully cute. It's complicated, all right? Think you're so special, don't you? ( whimpering ) That you can have anything or anyone that you want. Listen to me and listen to me very carefully. Mark is mine. You can't have him. And you will never, ever see him again. Do you understand me? Never! Now, just in case you forget, this will help you remember. ( screams ) - Did you hear that? - I did. ( screams ) ( car speeds off ) Hey. Hey. Just one now, they're not for you. Okay. So, um, do you think maybe you'll call-- you'll call Melanie today? I might, but please don't meddle in this, okay? Just once, let me do something on my own. ( chuckles ) ( video call ringing ) Yeah, that's a good point. ( no audible dialogue ) Uh, hi. Hi, Sam. Hey, Randy, can I, um, talk to you for a second? Yeah. Uh, to be continued. To be continued. You here to tell me that I'm right? Your plan worked. Mark and Melanie hit it off last night. That wasn't my plan. Well, you gave me the idea, so they're hitting it off and no more Carissa. You know what, Tanya? I'm done playing your manipulative games. Look, Mark is gonna be out of the house soon and he's moving on with his life. And you know what? So am I. I don't know what you're talking about. I think you try to control everything in your life. Ever since Hal's been gone, I have been there for you and Mark. I'm trying to fill this hole in your life the best I can and you--you find a way to somehow push everyone who cares about you away. You obviously don't know what you want or maybe you do. It's not me. I really don't know where this is coming from. I think you're just overreacting. Why don't you just--just calm down and take the muffin. I don't want your damn muffins. I'm tired. It's been 10 years, way too long. It's my fault. I should've said something years ago. I'm sorry, but I don't want to be your safety net anymore. Well, I--Randy, I... Throw me a soda, will you? Yeah. I don't get it. I thought we had a good time. I don't know why she's not picking up. You're such a pig. I'm not a pig. I'm into Melanie. So you're just gonna dump the woman who stole your flower, that's it? Dude, I already feel like a sleaze for making out with Melanie last night. I need to break it off with Carissa. So, that's it. You're done? Yeah, completely. Carissa. I just love this place. All the marine life, so impressive. Who's this big guy? That's MC. - MC? - MC Hammerhead. All the fish in the tank are named after recording artists. Oh, wow. Uh, that one there is the great Barry White. Mm-hmm. The fancy one shaking her tail, that's Sharkira. Her hips don't lie. And, oh, uh, is the--is the ray named Sugar or Charles? Sting. Very clever. What--what's that? Oh, this guy here? Yeah. - This is a trident. - Wow. Actually, don't touch. They're very sharp. Okay. It's the weapon of Poseidon and Neptune. - Okay. - Pretty cool. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm, yeah. So... Uh, Tanya's office is down the hallway to the right. Oh, uh, well, actually, Randy, I was, um, kind of here to see you. I mean, it's pretty obvious at dinner the other night that neither one of us is having our needs met by the Richards family. I know what it's like to give someone all your love and have them reject you. You are a siren. Excuse me? Could you please leave? What? Just, um, could you leave? Wait. Are you kidding me? I'm... - Yeah, I'm... - Don't. Don't bother. I'm--I'm going. Can I help you? Damn, he wasn't lying. Who? Mark wa--Mark wasn't-- I'm Mark's friend Wa-- I'm Mark's friend, Walter. I--it's very nice to meet you. Okay, yep. All right. What are you-- I mean, did Mark send you? Yeah, he, uh, he confided in me that you two were on the outs so I figured I'd come over and lend a shoulder to cry or, you know, any other services you might need. He told you we were breaking up? Yeah, he's crazy. I--I don't understand why you would trade in for the newer model when you have vintage classic at home, you know? Aren't you charming? Women just love to be referred to as vintage. Why don't you go ahead and make yourself comfortable? Um, so I guess I should just tell you about myself. I come from strong Dutch and German stock. Come on. Hey, uh, hello. Uh, Melanie? Uh, I can't really see you, um... Mark, I--I really can't talk right now. Well, I've been trying to call you all day. Yeah, I know, I--I'm not feeling well. Um, I've got to go. Uh, do you want me to come by? I can bring you some soup. No, no, no. No, no. It's okay. Uh, I'm not sure--I-- I don't think that we should see each other anymore. What? Why? I'm sorry, I really have to go. Hi, sweetie. Uh, hey, what's up? Great news. My friend from Intel Digital's coming over tonight. You ready to pitch your app? Uh, tonight's not really a good night for me. Can we do it some other time? Mark, I asked him to do me this favor. His time's very valuable. I know. I--I'm sorry. It's just... But you see, this is exactly what I'm talking about. You're never gonna get anywhere in life unless you get over your childish fears and go after what you want. I'm gonna pick you up at 8:00. Dress sharp. All right. See you later, Mom. Hey, honey, do you mind coming in here and chatting with me for a minute? I--I can't. I'm in a rush. You going to see Melanie? Oh. So where did you get those new... Never mind. Listen, have I been overstepping? Mom, we can talk when I get back, but I-- I won't be out that long. ( car horn ) Promise? I promise. So it'll remind her when to put oil in her car, when to buy her vitamins, uh, when her favorite TV shows are on. But the best part is the ad potential. My Little Man will make suggestions to the user throughout the day. So, uh, hey, there's a new low calorie yogurt at the supermarket. Um, you should pamper yourself today. Uh, this spa has seaweed wraps and, uh, well, basically, that's my app. Bravo. Very impressive presentation, Mark. Thank you, sir. It's hard to believe you're just out of high school. It's a million dollar idea, isn't it? - It is. - So what do we do now? Well, Montgomery Technology's just put out their version of your app last month. You had a great idea, but they beat you to the punch, kid. They've had years of market research and development. By the time we got your app up and running, it would be obsolete. Well, thank you for taking the time to meet with me. You've got top notch programming skills. When you're ready to join the working world, I better be your first phone call. Okay. Carissa? Always a pleasure. Thank you so much for coming all the way out here, Trevor. Helen says you're playing tennis Sunday. Maybe I'll see you at the club. Okay, great. - I know the way out. - Drive safe. I should be going, too. Wait. You're leaving? I--I got us some nice champagne. I--I thought we would celebrate. Celebrate what, that fact that I just spent six months developing something that I could've bought for a buck 99? Mark, he just offered you a job. You're gonna be working for one of the top software developers in the world. Yeah, in four years. Well, I mean, I really don't understand why you're going to college to--to get a job that you can have today. I don't know. I--I just--I need to go away and be my own man and experience life for myself, you know. You want to party and get laid. No, that's not what I was saying. No, no, no. It's okay. I get it. Need to, uh, sow your wild oats, as they say. Just like our little fling. It'll be one of your many adventures. Yeah, I guess so. Well, then let's toast to that. - Okay? - Okay. Grab those champagne flutes. Call me. Yeah. It really does open the pores and help to relax the muscles, don't you think? Why are you doing this? Oh, sweetheart, I'm not doing anything. You're the one doing it to me. Don't you see that? Stringing me along, making me believe that you want to be with me and--and really, really be with me. All the while just using me and waiting to leave me until you're done getting what you came for. Please let me go? No. I didn't let my husband leave me for that tight assed trainer. And he was old and wrinkly and useless in bed. What are you doing? This is all I am to you right? A little plaything, a toy to help satisfy that teenage libido of yours. Here's your most important life lesson, sweetheart. Women are not trophies. We're not to be traded like playing cards. We're not levels of a video game. Ow! Get off of me. Please. You love it. Now, stay still and don't make me hurt you, Mark. ( crying ) Mark? Mark? Where the hell is he? Blocked. You've reached the Walter Braunstein Experience. For tickets and directions, please leave your name and number. Thank you. Uh, hey, Walter, this is Tanya. Um, have you seen or talked to Mark? He didn't come home last night and, um, well, I'm a bit worried. So if you could call me back ASAP, please, uh, thanks. I'm sure he's all right. Ah. You want some? Yes. Too bad. Ah! Somebody! Shh. Relax. You'll last longer if you do. Hi, Randy. Sorry to interrupt you, but, um, have you spoken to Mark in the last 24 hours? I have not. Yeah, he's mad at me, too. It's not just like him to completely ignore my calls and texts. Yeah, well, if you talk to him, would you, please, tell him that his mother is very, very worried? Yeah. Thanks, Randy. 35 missed calls from Mom. This bitch is crazy. I'm at Carissa's. Come get me. ( beeps ) Who is it? Tanya Richards. I'm here to pick up my son. Oh, hello, Tanya. Did you bring muffins? I'm in a bit of a rush, thank you. Mark? Mark! Where's Mark? Come on in. Have a cocktail. I don't want to have a cocktail. Please send my son out now. Well, Mark's--he's a little hung up right now. But, hey, do you mind if we talk? I--I mean, you know, just until Mark's ready. It's kind of important. Fine. Right this way. Help! Somebody! Help! ( Mark's voice echoing ) Mm, a Napa Opus One. It doesn't get much better than that. Can I get you a glass? No, thank you. - I'll water it down. - No, thank you. Tanya, you have every reason to hate me. And then some. But I'm about to give you a very rare opportunity. If you're selling cosmetics, I'll pass. I prefer not to look like a whore. We're about to find out how much you really love your son. I can save you the time. I love my son more than you can imagine. No matter what he has done, unconditionally. I don't believe in unconditional love. Even a mother has a child with the selfish reason to have something love her back. But what if that child that she gave birth to one day grows up and rejects her? Stops loving her. I'm done with this conversation and I'm leaving. Mark! Honey, come on. Let's go. Put those on if you ever want to see your son again. You really must think I'm crazy. On the contrary, I think I am. Mark! Oh my God. Oh, my God, Mark! Poor baby! He's been in here almost a day. I don't know how much more he can take. Why are you doing this? He is a child, for God's sakes. Now, now, settle down. I thought you cared about him. But I do. That's why I'm gonna give you a chance to save him. There's one round in this gun. Mark's at death's door. Now, you could either put him out of his misery or you could use the bullet on yourself and I'll let Mark go. What? Why are you doing this to us? Mark and I had something very special, Tanya, and you went and screwed it all up. Now, I have to clean up this mess and I'll be damned I'm gonna be the one to take the blame for what you've done. Your son tried to leave me and I couldn't let that happen, Tanya. Do you understand me? He left me no choice! He did this! Hey! Ah! I'm speaking. So what's it gonna be? Mark dies or you die? Seems to me that either way, I win and you lose. So what do you say we put this whole mess behind us and get on with our lives? Well, or at least my life. You really are the goddamn devil, aren't you? Okay. Well, I'll be waiting while you sweat out your decision. I know it's a tough one. Mark. Mark, don't fall asleep now. You stay with me, honey. I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay. ( cell phone vibrating ) Pick up, pick up. Come on, Tanya, pick up. Can't get to the phone right now. Please leave a message. Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not... Come on. Stick that pretty little head in here. Mark, Mark, stay with me, Mark. Come on, baby. Oh, God. Oh, God. Mark... Mark, um, when your... when your father died, I, um, I was just so terrified of anything happening to you. I have been so, so selfish and a coward. Baby, I just--I just thought I was-- I thought I was protecting you from dangers of the world and I-- I was only protecting-- protecting myself. And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you. I'm so proud of you. One, two... ( loud bang on door ) Hurry it up! I'm not opening this door until I hear a bang. Oh, that's it. Honey, come on. Your mom's about to kick the shit out of this bitch. Oh, God. ( screaming ) That's it, mommy, do it. ( doorbell rings ) Who the hell is that? ( gunshot ) Wow. Look who had some balls after all. You don't get to win! I win! I win! I win! ( screaming ) Burn in hell, you bitch! No, Mark. Come on. You're okay. I got you. Watch out. Here, watch your head. Watch your head. Stay with me, Mark. Don't go. You're gonna be all right. I'm gonna get you-- I'm gonna get you to a hospital. - Baby. - No! ( shrieks ) ( rattling ) ( panting ) ( police sirens ) All right, that should be everything. All right, thank for your help, man. Dude, it's still not too late. I could put in a good word at the community college. I'll see you at Christmas. Okay. Um, I could make you guys some sandwiches. Oh, we have fruit and chips and soda. We'll be fine. Okay. Well, take care of him. All right, I'll try. Don't let him get into any trouble. I just don't know what I'm gonna do without my little man. Well, I'm sure your new one will pick up the slack. I'll do my best. Thanks for everything, Randy. Yeah, you go it. Okay, well, just keep it under 60 and call us as soon you get over the Arizona border and... Call me whenever you want. Okay, love you, Mom. I love you, too. - Take back your gold all the dreams that Were sold to you - Bye. - Bye. He'll be okay. Walter, would you like to stay for lunch? Oh, I can't. I'm going to the movies. My girlfriend's picking me up. Girlfriend? Whoa, look at you. ( car horn honks ) Oh, and there she is now. Did you guys know that seniors get half off on matinees? It's awesome. All right, baby.
