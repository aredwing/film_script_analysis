Come on. Come on, Carla. Tell us what she had to do with the prime minister. She was balling him. Wait a minute. She's all right, then. That makes her a hoe. She's okay.

Well, I'm gonna call the guard in And see what he has to say about that. You know, you've got a very pretty face. Well, forget it, honey. You're not my type. I'm only trying to tell you if you call the guard, It's not gonna be so pretty anymore. Oh, is that a threat? It's a fact. Honest. I'm only trying to help you. [Dramatic music] Come on, girls. In a line. You two, get a move on. Keep it straight. Get in line. Come on. Break these lines up. Straighter. All right. What is this big bird cage? That's what we call the mill out there, That big machine that presses the sugar out of the cane. The warden zappa is nuts about it. He had the whole thing built from his own plan, And he keeps adding to it, making it bigger and bigger. The ones who work in the bird cage Are the ones who didn't keep up Their boulders in the field Or girls who made trouble, Like fighting or stealing something. That's because people get hurt sometimes in the big bird cage, Especially informers get hurt, maybe even killed. [Screaming] [Screaming] [Thud] Like I was saying, Informers always get found out. All right, you girls. Off to work we go. [Dramatic music] [Water running] Well, look at our little Ms. fancy. You look like you were born with a coconut in your mouth. I learn fast. Almost anything. Oh, very good. We'll see in the long years to come. You're lucky. She likes you. So what? At first, I thought you were going to be in For a lot of trouble around here, But I can tell you're smarter than anybody thought. You know how to get on the good side of people. Look, I don't need any friends, And I don't want any enemies. All I want is to get out of this place. I heard about you and your letters, But I'm gonna tell you something. Your letters aren't gonna do you a damn bit of good. I don't believe you. I haven't even had a trial. Somebody'll get me out of here. Well, plenty of us said the same thing. You'll see. Get a move on. You there, up the stairs. Hurry it up. [Ominous music] No! [Screams] Please send her to mad house at once. [Screaming] [Screaming] [Screaming] [Screaming] [All screaming] That's horrible. They don't ever come out, Not for anything. Hey, Karen, you're a big dummy.

It's all full of women, 100s of 'em. Think of it, man. What a blow for freedom. Liberate all those young pretty girls. How you figuring on going about that? We got to get somebody on the inside. [Screaming] Doctor, doctor! [Moaning] [Mysterious music] Ah! [Laughs] Hey, stud, looking for anybody special? Eh. [Laughs] Tsiang. Prisoner tsiang. No. There she is, over there. [Laughs] Ah, there you are. Why you looking so dirty? You got to get all cleaned up. Oh, please. Not again. Take somebody else this time. Who are you kidding, cutie pie? Come along now. What's going on? The warden feels like having a little company. Well, it's good to know There's at least one man around here who's naturally inclined. Don't get your hopes up. Lin tsiang is the only one he's ever inclined with. Why not? She's a good-looking dish, if you like chop suey. Wow, you must be pretty thirsty. Yes. But, you know, I think I'm better now. I've stopped hearing those voices almost, But the others... They're insane. I don't want to be in here anymore. Listen, I'll see if I can get you out of here. I'll talk to the warden, okay?

You have nothing else to report. No, there's nothing more. I swear it. Well, I see. Then listen to this. Mommy, I miss you very much. Every night I cry and cry. When are you coming back? No, not now. That's enough. Perhaps next time if you bring me more important information Than useless bits of alcohol from the infirmary. Well, we mustn't have anyone suspecting you, Not even the guards. These women have ways of learning things from the guards. [Blows landing] [Moaning] [Dog growling] Down, boy. I'm not going anywhere. We're just looking. Well, girls, get out your cups. Gina's going home tomorrow, And she's got a little surprise for us. Give me that stuff. Ah. Let me get in here.

Belly up to the bar. Let me have that cup. Thank you. Mm. Where did that come from? She works in the infirmary. Wait a minute. That ain't from them jars with the guts in 'em again, is it? No, this time, it's the good stuff. Honest. What happens if they find out that she took it? Then she don't go home tomorrow. Or for a long time after that, either. [Dogs barking] Hey, hey, here she comes. Oh, shit. Sorry, big girl. It's for your protection, you know. The hell it is. It's for my protection from that big sex maniac over there.

There she goes. Damn it. She has no right not to tell us. She's the only one around here that ever gets any, And she won't even tell us about it. It's criminal! Doesn't anybody even know a new dirty joke? [Laughs] 'Course, some people around here don't need talk. You can tell what they're thinking just to look at 'em. Now, you take this big dyke here. You can tell by the way she looks at me Exactly what she's thinkin', And it ain't nice. You can tell how she'd love To put those big horny hands on my skin, Press that big, ugly body down on top of me. Hey, wait a minute! [Clattering] [All yelling indistinctly] [Screaming] So help me you little bitch, I'm gonna get you. I will.

Some government people are coming to inspect the camp, And some of the girls have been chosen to meet them. Now, this is our chance to get some help. Don't you see? Oh, yes. If we can only talk to someone. We will. But first, we've got to get you cleaned up. The warden wants to see you looking pretty. Oh, yes. Of course.

I'll tell them what's it's really like in this place, And when I get out of here, I'll see that something's done about the rest of you, too. Yeah, do you really think you can? Sure, I've got some pretty big friends. All I need is just to talk to somebody from the outside Just for a few minutes, just to get a message out. I don't think those fellas come here for conversation, Honey. They come here for coochie. Shut up about that. I can't stand to think about it. If only I could get laid by a real man once in a while, I think I could stand it. [Soft Hawaiian music] Don't worry, I'll steer you through this. I know how to handle these creeps.

It's better than going on like this. Bullshit. You'll just make it worse. Anyway, I don't have to argue about it. I'm just telling you to back off. Now!
