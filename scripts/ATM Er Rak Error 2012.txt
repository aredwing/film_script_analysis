What's your type? - My type? - European. - C-cup. - Mixed. - Prim and proper. / Chompoo Araya - Players are exciting. - Never gave it any thought. - Slanted eyes are a turn off. You should be asking, who finds me attractive? In our department if you could choose anybody, whom would you choose? If I had to choose someone here? Do you ask everyone this question? I'd rather be alone. May I go now? Is it true? Yeah sure... Thip. You can't be that naive. If they aren't together, they won't drink from the same straw. Acting like this, they did it already. Seriously inside the coffee shop I saw he touched her ass. Everyone please come to the meeting room. Before you started work here everyone signed an employment contract with a "non-fraternization" clause. According to statistics in Japan Stupid rule. If they want to be together why stop them? Right! How Idiotic! And another 46.7% will conspire to commit crime. Now in our department there is someone breaking this rule. Ms. Ning. Shit. You? Mr. Aek. Please follow me to my room. Damn. - What the heck is wrong with you? - I tell Aek to look at Ning's boobs everyday. Just now I told him to look. Stay away from me. I am not that close to you. Oh this is a photo taken on orientation day. Well, Ning and I have been close ever since university. - Exactly. - Right? Very close. Like brother and sister. You guys are this close? Oh this is the after party. - Spraying water. Lot of people played. - Yes yes. Fun. - Just drunk. - Totally drunk. What about this? Oh it is just a game. - Yes. - That is also game. - Yeah that is a game too. - What kind of game? Pass the watermelon game. Yes. Just passing it along in turn. Yes, lots of people played. That is a watermelon, not a tongue? If that is a watermelon, this must be a hotdog. Who posted this photo!? I don't know. Ms. Jib. It is not what it looks like. Fine. Then you and Aek need to decide who is giving the hand-job. You mean is "giving up their job"? - I can't take it anymore! - Huh? I can't stay this way and fire people. If anyone finds out about us. What am I going to do? Jib don't be paranoid. - No one will know about us. - Anyone following us? - No. - I told you to check, check! I did. OK then. What about we bring fake dates to show at work? - Wait. A fake partner? - Yes. A fake one. - Whoever, just hire one. A maid or someone. - Gosh. Jib! Don't try to argue with me. Jib stop it. No need to know what we are. There is no need for words. This is the pressure I have to confront I have given all my heart to you. Here it comes. It's your fault. You hit on me first. You made the first move. Move? When did I do that? Umm... Miss We're here. Just call me Jib. We are same age. Fine. I admit it. But you flirted with me back. What is this? This document is confidential. For your (urgent) consideration Don't be surprised, I just want to tell you... This girl... is so cute. You're late. Don't think I won't dock your pay. You can take my money, but don't break my heart. Let's break up. What? What's wrong with you! That is not the solution. Are we a couple or just lovers? Why do we have to hide like this? It's very frustrating. Then let's get married. Thank you. So it will be on Oct. 31 st Halloween. Please make an 150,000 Baht deposit within 2 weeks. Congratulations. Smiling now? What? Feeling better now? So you already proposed then? No time to get cold feet later, OK! Have I ever chickened out yet? Hello Ms. Jib. Stop messing around here. Yesterday when I proposed to you, I was just kidding. - You looked stressed that's why. - No way. I'm already 27. I won't ever let you go. Gosh. So forceful. I already told my family too. My parents are very happy. They said you will have to resign then. So you can help at the factory. Umm wait. I didn't say I would resign. You first. You proposed first. Yes, I did. Yes. I did propose but I didn't say that I will quit. Jib you should resign. I will take care of you. And why can't I be the one to take care of you? What kind of a man would allow that? Allow what? Nowadays it's normal. Normal if you are a pimp. - But I earn more money than you do. You quit! - You quit Jib! - Hello. - Hello. / Hi. Miss. Jib. This is my son. Just got his masters from Cornell. The one who will be training here. Hello. My name is Yo. If you ask me how I feel to be here I would like to tell you all that I am very excited. And if you wonder how I feel. Nobody asked. No shit. His parents must have dropped him when he was little. Sure. And his face hit the ground first. I feel a bit pressured. But if you ask if I am scared, I am not. Because I am sure that I am joining a team made up of professionals. Thank you very much. So everyone please no need to go out of the way for me. - Anything you want to teach him, do so. - You know I can just fire you. Don't be intimidated, just think of him as an ordinary trainee who must start work on time. - If you fire me, I will tell your boss! - And finish work on time too. No privileges. And if he ever is out of line, you can tell me. Umm dad? About the bank's no fraternizing rule, for trainees it doesn't apply right? No no. That's a relief. That means umm... I can hit on Ms. Jib. You are joking, right? This is not a joke. This is for real. Ms. Jib. Ms. Jib. Yes? How is the new software system? We have already started implementing it at Chonburi. The stadium is packed full of Buriram fans but they can't drown out the cheers of Chonburi fans. The game has started, Chonburi got the kick-off. Piphop kicks the ball to the left of Therdsak and is passed to Nattapong. Hey, hurry up! - Hey! What? How come it is in Japanese? Let me see. How to change to Thai? How am I suppose to know? It's all in Japanese. You're right. Damn it! May be this one? Look. They are both in the same spot. You sure? Buriram has control of the ball. It's one to one. Oh My... saved by Sintawee! Oh that was close! Your call. I'm sure it's the one. Chonburi Chonburi Buriram! The 4th referee added 3 mins in the first half of the game. Withdrawal amount. One two three four... Balance amount = 17,500.00 Available Balance = 17,500.00 What's up Pued? Hello Pad! Come to the ATM now it's giving out free money. What? I can't hear you. I said the ATM is paying out double. What? Free what? The ATM is giving away double your money! What double Ds? The ATM is giving away double your money! The one in front of Thai Insurance Co. OK then just see you later. And why are you speaking Northern dialect? No bro I said the ATM is cashing out double. Huh! The ATM is giving out free money! Holy shit! Director of ATM Department How can an ATM give away an extra Our IT guys checked the hard disk and detected an error in the updated software. Did you check the CCTV? What's wrong with the picture? Why did you allow someone to carelessly stick a pest control ad here? I called them to complain already. Our high angle CCTV, must have something right? What's this? The technicians who installed the software... They tried to return to resolve the situation. But... Pull the plug!! The techs said all the people involved took the money during the half-time football break. What time was the break? Cross reference the timestamps from the ATM and you'll have all the names of withdrew persons. I already told you that there was a glitch in the software so none of the names on that list have timestamps next to it. Which means there's no way to track down who made withdrawals with extra money? From the information we have on hand I would say we have nothing. How long have you worked here? Almost 10 years. Before the board meeting next Friday I need to know who made those withdrawals and we need to get all the money back. If not then I will dock 10 yrs of bonus instead! Umm... Both of you! But it is only 130,000 it can't compare with 10 years of our bonus. It isn't about the money it is about the trust in our bank. Ms. Jib Ms. Jib, is your heart still available? My heart is available and enough room to keep your in there. Do you want to change your last name to mine? Whoa. It's your chance to try it out. The only fear I have is you will love it. Love love my last name. This isn't a threat but this was just the appetizer. Just quit! If I were Jib and had a guy sing a song like that to me I would jump out the window. Jib is starting to fall for him. I heard that they will go upcountry together. Huh!? Yes. Upcountry. Over night. I bet this time Yo and Jib will... get it on for sure. I am so jealous of Yo. Look carefully, Jib's boobs are big too. They bounce when she walks. I'm getting goosebumps. Argg! Argg! What the hell man? Oops, I am sorry. I flicked my wrist too hard on that one. Is it red? If not staring at it, you'd barely notice. Why did you put a spin on it. My eye is going to fall out. I'm not playing anymore. - Fine you get the points. - You have it! Just the two of you together. People will say you are easy. Why would anyone think so dirty? We are going to work. Then go with me. I can't. People will talk. Then tell me what are you working on? I will do it. It's out of your league. Yeah? They're sending you to stop the flooding? No, an ATM in Chonburi accidentally paid out 130,000 and the bank wants to know who withdrew it. I have to recover the cash. That's it? Piece of cake. It isn't that simple. If you succeed, I will resign. OK. You said it! If I can do it, you will quit. And what if you can't do it? Then I will quit. I will remember you said that. I am glad that my girlfriend doesn't have Alzheimer's. Aummara To love, must take a risk. 1 pm in front of your house. What's in your hand? Gum. Let me see. Why did you swallow your gum? You are going to meet that loser again? Listen Gob. You can talk to me about anything. I will always... I am sorry mom. Gob! I am your mother! You brat! Bastard. Damn you! JNBC Bank. Chonburi branch. Ms. Jib saw all these pictures already, correct? Yes. Here is the list of who made withdrawals that day. All of this? Yes. And Ms. Jib already saw this list too? Correct. Argg!! Living large huh? Temporary closed. Interview 100 people a day Should be okay. Possible. Shit! Hell no! Hole in one! How could it fall into this tiny hole?! Shit! Shit! Actually you don't have to walk me. No, I have to because it's dark and dangerous around here. You never know if there's a psycho lurking around. How are things going? No progress yet. Please follow up by checking on Mr. Sua as well. Why do we have to do that? I am evaluating his work and I don't want him to know. Oh I see. Ah huh. You are really hard working. Oh Jib, If I wanted to talk to you about something wouldn't you... ummm feel uncomfortable? Well... You are really great at work. Sweet and very responsible. Let me be direct. You are my type. Just a sec. Hello. Sup bitch!? Last night I was so smashed. I had to hold the toilet just to puke. Damn right, and? Yes bitch. I don't even wanna brag. Hold on. Thanks for sending me off. Shit, it was like... Damn it! I smell like puke. Bitch. And the cigarette you bought yesterday. Talking about it makes my throat itch. Are there any locksmiths in the area? Hop in. I will take you. Are you from around here? Bangkok. Yes? Hello. What can I do for you, Mr. Sua? Can you schedule appointments with the people on the list for tomorrow? - Oh sure. - Schedule as many as you can. Mr. Sua, what are the appointments for? I think the people who withdrew the extra money are on this list. Oh I see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And why are you here? Taking care of some business. You work at the bank? Are you sure there's a locksmith around here? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey... what's wrong with the car? Still got gas too. Oh my god. What? Sorry bro, can you go push the car for me? Totally not my day. Holy shit. Holy shit. Hey, where are you going? Come back! You forgot something?! Me! Hey! What the hell! Shit!! Shit! No wonder it's locked tightly. Hey! What are you doing here? Please don't shoot. Don't shoot. Hey! Hey! Gob. Pued. Pued. Come here! One sec. Gob. Please take good care of my heart. Of course. I only have one and I don't easily give it out. Got it. I'm... only give it to the one I truly love. Love you. Pued! Enough already. Look at her. She looks like she really needs to take a dump. So cute. Cut it out. Gotta go now. Hurry. What are we going to do? I already used the money to buy my bike. You're lucky. Look at me. They got to rip out my tooth. What am I going to do? We set him on fire. But there will be smoke. Then drown him? His body will float. Think jackass! Feed him to sharks? Not even a bone left. Not a bone left. How much money we got in total? The two of us, around 30,000 or so. and you want to kill someone for that?! So what should we do? I don't know man. I just know. I am really hot! Open the window. Thank you. Sorry. Are all the interviewees here? Hey... you. - Ms. Jib! - Yes? - What are you doing here? - Here to see you, Mr. Sua. Oh... Manager, Ms. Jib just arrived. She must be tired. Maybe a coffee will help. Please get her one? Sure. Sure. It's good you're here. So you can see how a professional gets work done. Yes. You're so professional - why is there nobody here yet? - Soon. - Really? - Yeah. Mr. Professional, want some noodles? The noodles are getting stale. I gotta go. Watching a professional like you has tired me out. I sympathize How are you going to know who those people are? Don't give up. That's him! Pued. My finger is stuck. Let me help. You call that help? - My finger is going to tear off. - I am sorry. Pued can you see is he gone yet? He is crossing the street. That's okay. Pued, just get out of here. Don't worry about me. - Okay. - Damn Pued! I was just testing you. You are my true friend... Hey, you! Why did you leave me yesterday? What? Leave? You left! Where did you go? I went to use the toilet. You disappeared. I drove around all night looking for you. Pad, isn't this the guy you said is here to get the money back? This is the guy who took the money. - I don't think so. - Yes it is. Your relative died a month ago. The ATM incident took place this week. He can't be the guy. What are you doing here? Are you guys related to him? - Yes. - That's good. He's been scaring everyone every night. Very scary! You must call out his soul and guide him home. Give him directions in detail. From the temple's entrance, turn left go over the bridge. At the intersection turn right. When you see 7-11, turn there and go down until you get to house number 114. Isn't that my house? Yes it is. Gosh. Ms. Aummara Pornsuchart Hello manager. I need you to do me a favor. Yes Ms. Jib, what can I do for you? But you cannot tell Mr. Sua. Hey. Stop stop stop. Stop here. It's gone. Gone. My car was parked right here. My car's gone! Where did my car go? I'm not lying, seriously. I dropped the key in the gutter. I didn't say you were lying but you can't pick your car lock this way. How about bring me your car registration for verification and then you can take your car. You - got guns? - Sure. What kind do you need? Custom or standard issue. - Custom. - Short or long? - Short is fine. - Gas or air? Air. - Roll or magazine? - Magazine. - Dull black or glossy? - Dull black. - Just a sec. - OK. All out. - What do you have? - Nothing. You punk. Why so many questions then? You're wasting my time. I have handcuffs, - You want? - I'll take it. Metal or? Metal or whatever just get it! Put them all on the counter and I will pick. Some water too. Water or? Whatever is in your fridge just bring it! Chrysanthemum water - What if there is none. - Just bring whatever. Gosh!

Let's go catch some criminals. Miss Jib - Head office Did you send me the fax? About to. I didn't get it yet. Did you forget? No I didn't. Umm... sorry, Mr. Sua. My wife needs me to run some errands. That's fine. I can handle it myself. Send fax. Excuse me. Can I use your fax? Go ahead Lieutenant. Thank you. Hi! Did you receive my fax just now? Is it the one with attention to Ms. Jib? Room 8005, right? Room 8005, what hotel again? Here's some water. It's Tharachonburi hotel. Can you check whether the entire fax got through? Because when I sent it there was an error. Oh, please wait. OK. Ah... Ah... Ah... One moment. Yes it looks fine. Can you read it for me just in case? What does it say? There is no message. Just a copy of an ID Card. Huh? A copy of an ID card? Whose ID card? Aren't you the one who sent it? You should know. Oh yeah. Sorry. I forgot. Thank you very much. Ah... Ah... Ah... Sir, what kind of ice is this? Not cold at all. - My dentures. - What!? Tharachonburi hotel. Hello. There is a fax for you at the front desk. Okay. - Hey you! - Hey?! Move over. - You are a cop? - Yup. Let's go to Tharachonburi now. Yes sir. Hey follow that car! Hurry! Hurry up! Umm okay. Aummara laundry service. Sir why is that woman going to Ms. Aum's shop? She is trying to get back the bank's money. You guys aren't on the same team? Yes we are. Ms. Aummara, right? Yes. I am Aum. Laundry drop? No. I am from JNBC bank. Oh what can I do for you? You withdrew money from an ATM paying out double right? No. I don't know what you are talking about. Really? I think you do. Your withdrawals are very unusual. What do you mean by unusual? Did I use my elbows to withdraw? No. Unusual because on Oct. 2nd You made 6 consecutive withdrawals and 3rd, 4th and 5th another 20,000 Baht And the last one was 16,000 Baht totally 78,000 baht. Normally to withdraw 78,000 Baht You should withdraw 20,000 - 3 times And 18,000 last. Correct? So what if I withdrew money that way. I'm free to withdraw money any way I like, right? I didn't say you can't. But it seems like after you discovered the ATM gave you extra money you made 5 more withdrawals. So you got double extra money right? Are those brand new washing machines? Please have the money ready by tomorrow. I will come by to get the money. What are we going to do next? Follow her. - I need a room. - What type? I want room #8004. If you keep acting like this, I won't click like for you. Let's both take 1 step back. Each take 1 step back. Take 1 step back. Step back? Non-sense! No way. Hello. - Are you home yet? - Got home awhile ago. I drove, didn't walk. What's up? Are you free tomorrow? Can you go see my mom. She needs help with the buffet head count. Tomorrow? I can't, very busy. Oh never mind then I can do it then. About quitting prepare yourself. I will win. Look, the moon is smiling at us now. What does the moon have to do with anything? You make no sense. What are you up to? What happened if I had a heart attack? If you're serious about our competition you could have at least changed your car. If you're going to cheat. Don't get caught like this. Shameful. Look at you, impersonating a cop. You look more like a postman! It worked so far. You better get ready to resign. The laundry lady already returned all the money to me. Where's the money? Show me. In the bank. In our 3 years together I know that when you lie your nostrils will twitch like that! See! - Cross-eyes! - What?! Furry forehead! Where are you going? Curse and run. - Come back then you wuss! - Cross-eyes! - Sissy! - Wait. Who are you talking to? I can't tell from your eyes. Hey wait. Wait. Tissue? That won't hurt. Ouch! Prepare for defeat. Here is the face of the person resigning. Jib... Better use your time to become my house wife... Sua Excuse me. Is Ms. Aummara here? Is Ms. Aummara here? Mom went out. Where did she go? You won't know the place. Let me take you. OK. Let me get on... The bike, right? Of course! No. You might pretend to break hard. Better if I ride. Hey don't forget me. - Mom. Mom. - What? Someone is looking for you. Yes officer? He said that you took extra money from the ATM and he wants to see you. So I took him here. What money? I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't take it. Yeah correct. My mom didn't take it. The other day a customer forgot 20 Baht in his pocket. And mom returned it. My lovely daughter. But if you don't believe her my mom can swear to the lord buddha. Ma'am! Ma'am! Shit! This isn't the Tour de France! Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me. How much to Ms. Aumara's laundry? I'm not on the job. It is not my route. Try another car. Hey hold this. - What is this? - Frogs. Nooooo!!! Am I at the hospital? No you're at the bank. What! Bank! Bank, bank? I didn't take the money. I don't know anything. I didn't take any extra money. Wow so handsome. Please keep an eye on your mom. Don't let her give the money to that bank lady. - Got it? - No problem. I will take care of it. Gosh, what I got myself into! Just snap away please. 123 So cute together, huh? ...lovely. Look at this! So sweet. What song is this? The wedding march song played in church. No it's advertising theme song for 5 star chicken! Oh really? Gob. Gob, what are you doing here with... him? Nothing. We ran into each other by accident. What's in your hand? How could you take wedding photos with him? What about me? Me? Me? Hey are you two boyfriend girlfriend? - Yes. - No. - Just friends. - Friends? In the past I admit I had feelings for you but now I realize he is... the one. It's not what it looks like. There is nothing going on between us. If it makes you happy then I will go. It is after all, my fault my heart fell too quickly. Hey you. Don't you think your boyfriend deserves an explanation? Thank you for your understanding. Damn. No one listens to me. Wait.

Oh it must be my car key and registration. Just open the package. If it is, could you get the car from the police station for me? - Oh okay. - Thank you. Ready to go? Are you in a hurry, Ms. Jib? Mr. Sua is asking me to get his car for him. Good. We can get his car first then help him catch some thieves. Let's go. What did you expect from just a close friend? It's been 3 months and you never proposed to me? Huh? What the heck? I am poor. Where would I get the money? What about when you said you won that money? So instead of proposing to me you used the money to buy the bike, right? Yes. So about the ATM giving out extra money, you took some too, right? Yes. Can I go back to being your girl who rides your bike? Hey! Gob, what are you doing? So you admitted it, Pued. You took the extra cash from the ATM, right? Choose? Return the money or spend the night in jail? I don't know anything. Shit! You won't talk? Manager. Do it. Will you talk? Manager, put it inside his shirt. No. No. No. Stop it. I will talk now. You won't talk huh? OK send someone now. I am at the football field. I withdrew 14,000 and double the amount came out. Oh no no. It's itching. I got it together with Pued. We both got double. Pued.

Hey are you crazy or what? Did you really intend to shoot the kids? I only wanted to scare them. I didn't mean to fire. But the gun went off by accident. Doc. How is my kid, Jack? Jack. My sweetheart. Look at your dad. When you were little and hit your head. He told me to stitch it up myself. Didn't even take you to the hospital. No wonder I have issues. I need love from men. Doctor. Doctor. Is my son okay? I am so sorry. We have tried our best but your crocodile lost too much blood. Oh no. No! Also this was stuck inside his throat. What is that? That is mine. The treatment fee is 1,200 Baht. Another 10,500 is for the damage to the equipments. Where will I get that kind of money? I will pay. If it wasn't for me this wouldn't have happened. Everyone went through so much trouble. Thank you all so much for helping me. Actually, the extra money you took is partly the bank's fault. You got 20,000 Baht extra, right? Correct. I wanted to return it but I already bought Jack with it. His full name is Jackpot. The fortune teller said if I have a pet named Jackpot. It will increase my luck. What about you, Ms. Aumara? I bought new washing machines with all the money. What about you guys? A down payment on the bike. I lost my tooth a while back and I feel embarrassed. So I got a gold implant. Okay. I will tell the bank I couldn't track down the people who took the money. Hey what about our deal? We owe these people our lives. Pued. Pued. Pued stop! Turn around. So cute. You're crazy. Sweetie. The hell is wrong with you two! You aren't in love. You won't understand. You think you are so cute, huh? Gosh... Wasting my time waiting for you loser! The woman from that room left this for you. - Thank you. - Welcome. Put the wheels back... for me. What about you, Ms. Aummara? I used the money to buy washing machines. What about Pued and Pad? A down payment for the bike. I lost my tooth a while back so I got a gold implant. Sound clip evidence. Case: Lost cash. From ATM Boss. Today's meeting has been postponed. OK. Keep me updated. Boss. Please sign here... Go over this again. - Has legal gone over this yet? - All done. You can start legal proceedings. We need to prosecute to the full extent. What about you, Ms. Aummara? I bought new washing machines. What about Pued and Pad? - Very good Ms. Jib. - A down payment for the bike. - I lost my tooth a while back so I got a gold implant. - Aha. Hello? Yes this is Ekaluck. What? Huh?! Shit! Mr. Sua Mr. Sua I thought you said your girlfriend will take care of this? How come the bank is still calling? They said they got our voice clips and they'll sue us. Here 130,000 Baht. The amount that was taken. Well done. - Yes? - Ms. Jib Mr. Sua recovered the money already and returned it to the bank. Please inform the legal to cancel the proceedings. Alright. Yes? Mr. Sua please come to my office. Where did they get the money? They got a loan. OK, since you recovered the money that means I lost. I will talk to my boss about quitting. Jib. They didn't get a loan. That was the money for our wedding. What? You used our wedding money to pay? You made me. How could you sue them after everything they did to help? Please don't change the subject. Do you know what you're doing? What about you, Jib? You want to win so bad, nothing else matters. Selfish, don't you think? You don't want to get married right? You never wanted to propose right? That's a separate issue. Don't mix them together. Just admit it! - You didn't want to propose. - I was only trying to find a solution. So you didn't have to hide and pretend and you won't be paranoid and stressed. That's your solution? No need to hide. Just break up. Easier. You mean that? Yes I do. - Seriously? - Yes. Fine. Let's break up. Wedding's off. I am sorry. Wait up. Sorry. Sorry. Thank you. - Whose 1,200 is this? - From all of us. We will pay you in small installments When it rains it's always the same question, "Are you tucked in a blanket?" Every morning "How are you today?" Love you my darling no matter the day I will always say "love". What is this? Jib... better use the time to practice being a good house wife... Sua - Yo - Yes? Please call Mr. Sua for me. - Okay. - Don't. I will resign. Hey! What? That was slick of you. What's that? Don't act innocent. What does she see in you? She gave up her career for you. - She quit? - Yes. Hey about Jib's boobs I never really noticed them, OK! You remember when I said Jib has really big boobs? And when she walked it bounced up and down. I was just kidding, alright? The thought never crossed my mind. Not even once. What? I'm going out. Let me hear the girls scream! Tonight the ghosts who are still single dance till your heads fall off! Tonight was supposed to be our wedding party. Sure if someone didn't take the money and used it. Jib. But you did the right thing. It was my fault. I wanted to win so badly. I caused so much trouble. Please tell them I'm sorry. You know, I already quit my job. What? Are you crazy!? What were you thinking? I quit so that you can keep yours. And why did you quit? Because I am just kidding! I didn't quit. Hey that is not funny at all. Have you ever heard of the word "appropriate"? How could I resign? If I did, Who would take care of you? What if I proposed to you again? What would you say? What if I say no. What would you say? If nothing else I will go back down stairs. How about this? Rock-paper-scissor to see if we marry or not? Is everything just a game to you? If I lose, you have to marry me. Okay? If I lose you must marry me. One two three. Jib. Marry me? You're the only person in my life who I don't mind losing to. I love you so much, Jib. Marry me? Then you lose. What took you so long? You made it sound difficult. I wasn't sure if I understood you correctly. I know you aren't stupid. May I kiss my fiancee now? Up to you. Nah. Nerd! All the couples in the house! Let me hear some noise!
