Tonight is one of the nights that daddy tucks you in, okay Jack? No. Boy you are stubborn. That is daddy's worst trait. Dad: I do recall that's how I got my prom date with you though. Hmm, let's go. I'll be right down. Hey come here, come here, look at me. Remember, your worst quality can also be your best. Okay? Give me a hug. And he's in for the score! Good night sweetie. I love you. Mike: Don't, please. Help! Brandon: She is thirsting for my penis. She's hungry. Man: She is so bad. She can't see out of the back of her head, nimrod. Yeah, but I'm saying-- yeah, and I'm a sexual being, big woop. I'm out there. I've put myself in the field. I'm a predator. I'm like,. Another one. Ah, looks like I'm just in time. Gives me an idea. So... Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Jack. Jack: Thanks. -Hey, man. -Hey. -How you doing? -Good. Why are you sitting here? You feel okay? Yeah. All right, well, I got my eye on a few ladies. You wanna go, you wanna go talk to them? And do a little hunting, a little pussy hunting? -Jack: I'm okay. -Yeah! Go on ahead. I have a favor to ask from you though. Can you watch the door while I go to the bathroom, I really have to use the bathroom. You don't wanna go in there. You know, ah, goddamn, that stings! Does uh, does your bro wanna play flip cup? He's not-- he's not my brother actually, he's my cousin. I don't care, I don't care. You keep saying stuff. I don't care. Do you wanna play? I'm good, thank you. I'll play. Do I need any dice for this? What's happening here, i like it, it's very good, very passionate, very sexy. If we could just get a little of this left hand down on the titty. Just touch them titties. Just one bit, come on. What-- hi, how are you? Turner, what are you doing? Hi, I'm Turner, nice to meet you. Hi. Hi, hello, these are very lovely boots. Do you mind if I sit right here in the middle here, a little fast? All right, ahh, so, uhm, I'm here now, so why don't you guys just catch me up, where were you two. It looks like you were somewhere around right here. I don't think so. Oh! Brunette girl: No, no! All right, well. Smell ya later. Yo, who's that fucking freshman who has never smoked weed before? Brandon: Oh, I've never smoked. -Frat boy 1: That's you? -Yeah. Frat boy 1: Take a hit right now! I'll take it. Oh, he should take it. Frat boy in purple shirt: Take a hit, it's your birthday! -No, no, no, no. -Frat boy 1: Oh, go for it! Dude I don't have all day man. All right, let's go, I'll do it! You know, this is how you do it. Look, look, look, look! You light it and you just go,. Brandon: Could you light it for me? Frat boy in purple shirt: You can light it for him right? Yeah you go it, all right! Group: Freshman, freshman, freshman... Let's go!! -What the fuck? -What the fuck? -I am so... -You can't do that! That wasn't me, there was some flash of just red. Man: That's insane! Get the fuck out of my house! Get the fuck out of my house! Turner: I swear there is no way that your dick is sorer than mine is. Brandon: No I'm telling you, I really went to town on myself last night. Turner: Oh yeah, you did. Whereas little Turner, he was taken care of by an experienced third party participant last night. What, no way, you f-ed a girl? Turner: Oh, better. You told her you loved her? What, no, man, I got my dick sucked. Nice, you got it on the forehead cam? Oh, every juicy detail, i mean from her head just slowly moving down... Ah, into the point of no return. Oh yeah, brother! Enters your gravitational pull... -Turner: Yeah-heah! -Just wiggling around. I mean if I'm the sun, she is the closest planet to the sun. Whatever planet, it's sucked in! Exactly, you know what I'm saying? Brandon: Or she's like the millennium falcon, you know, when she's getting drawn in by the tractor beam, and she can't escape, because she's helpless. Jack, you must be reading the longest damn birthday card of all time over there. Yeah seriously, who's that from? It's from uncle Mike. Oh uncle Mike, how's he doing? He's okay, he invited me to come over to his place over winter break. Oh, just you and uncle Mike, that sounds lovely, I'm not going. Can I see it? Okay, he didn't invite you. Brandon: It says he's not gonna be there. Oh, tight as fuck, definitely going. All of us, what do you say boys? I'm in! I don't think it's really a good idea. Oh come on, Jack! You gotta let me come, man if I don't get to go away for winter break, my dad said he's gonna make me work for him! You know how fucking lame that is man? He works at quiznos! Look, uncle Mike is not really the epitome of fun. Fuck uncle Mike then. He's not even gonna be there right? He's not gonna be there. See, just us boys! Three guys. -Hmm-mm. -One cabin. -Uhuh! -Non-stop fellatio. All night, from girls. My god, with the fucking touching man, I'm trying to do my own thing here, shit. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hell man, I know my whole family ain't getting into heaven 'cause if I get there, and I see them, I'll know I'm in hell. I believe when I get to heaven, I'm gonna get a lot of just all that old pussy I had before I got there. It's gonna be right there waiting for me again. Yeah, but I don't really worry though about dying. It's not so much dying a virgin, it's just dying without like... Doing anything. Turner: Nah dude, you'll be fine. I've done a little bit. Turner: You'll be good, man. That's why we're taking this little vacay, man. I'm gonna teach you, you're my little cub, my little baby cub. All right, I can be the cub. Turner: Yeah brother, that's right. Brandon: Suckling on her nipples. Turner: Yeah, no, no, no, none of that. Well well. Oof, oh man. What the fuck is this man. This is my uncle's house. Turner: Well, I mean, was it in a fire or something man? Brandon: Come on. Turner: Place looks like a fucking turd. No, it's rustic. It's how it's supposed to look. Turner: Okay, all right. I'm just saying, this place doesn't exactly give me, you know, warm cuddly feelings. Brandon: Isn't that why you brought your shotgun? You're just a crazy person. Turner: Just wait, i got it, I got it. Good grab. Oh, a little chilly. -Oh, sorry. -Yeah, whatever. Yeah. Turner: At least the inside looks nicer than the outside! Oh, shotgun biggest room! Brandon: No way, that's the coolest room! Uncle's Mike recorded message: Hey Jack, it's uncle Mike, just checking in. I wanted to make sure that you got in all right. Uhm, look, I'm not gonna be around for the next week or so, and I'm not gonna have any cell service where I am. So I uh, I guess I'll just see you when I get there. Uhm, be careful, all right kiddo? Brandon: I'll wake you up with my midget porn, you're not complaining. You brought it on yourself! Man... Turner: What the fuck. Bro! -Brandon: What? -Turner: What? Oh, the breaker broke. Turner: Yeah. What are we supposed to do? Live like, fucking jebediah and his amish goddamn band mates or what? We'll call someone tomorrow. No, I want a flashlight right now. Where's our flashlight? I don't know. Turner: That's all right. This'll work. No it won't work! I'm in the middle of a battle. Can you pause it, please? Would you pause it, Turner? You're being inconsiderate. Jack: Oh shit, shit... Shit! I got there, I got there to pick you up, I can get home safe. Dude, you only have your learner's. You don't have a wallet on you. You're wearing a garbage bag. So where did you sleep last night? A dumpster. Brandon: Why-- why are you sleeping in dumpster? I don't know. You know if it's something weird like some fetish thing, I get it, all right. Let's just say I get it. So you can tell me, if you want, you know. I'm into some nasty shit, I'm sure you got a-- we're related. You must have some weird stuff going on. Sexually. Hey, all right! Jack, honey... Mommy has to go. And I'm gonna take you over to your cousin's house, okay? Okay. Promise me something, Jack. When you turn 18, if you feel sick, don't be afraid. Repeat after me. When I'm 18... Jack: When I'm 18... If I feel sick... Jack: If I feel sick... Mom: I won't be afraid. Jack: I won't be afraid. Turner: Hey crystal, what's up? It's Turner. What no, no, we haven't met. It was the app just a few minutes ago, remember? No, no, I'm the guy that sent you the photo of just his balls. Yeah, you wrote back like right away. Yeah, no, the cute balls. Yeah, with the razor blade next to it. Hey, come on, I swear I'm not a serial killer. I mean the app I'm using says we're only two miles away. Jack, where are you going? Just out, for a walk. Turner: Okay, tell me more. Oh, yeah you're fucking wet. Would you get off the phone with your mom already? Turner: I'll fucking kill you I swear to god. Just hang up! Mike: So what's the status? Mom: He has the gene. Shit. Well, I don't know what we were expecting. Mom: The chains didn't hold. I need you to get the cage. Mike: That's your responsibility. Mom: You know I can't. Someone could recognize me. I'll arrange to get it there tomorrow. Mom: He needs it tonight. Well, I can't get it tonight. Mom: Mike, if you don't wanna go back-- look, I've done my best to lead a normal life, and I'm not about to fuck it all up right now. We had a pact. You're lucky I'm even talking to you. He's gonna have to wait till tomorrow. Turner: Well, it's not a fucking real road, you fucking idiot, it's a piece of cardboard. Brandon: I know, I was just kidding, I was just joking. Jesus, oh my god. Brandon: Ah, shit. What the fuck is this? Brandon: Ah, it'll probably turn on in the morning like yesterday. Ah, what the fuck man. This is Jack's uncle's house. He should be here dealing with this shit. Do you know the story about Jack's family by the way? Yeah, his mom like shot up his dad or something, right? No, it goes way beyond that. A lot more. All right, well every family has problems. I mean, shit, my dad used to be an alcoholic. Still is, we just got over it. They have a Wikipedia page, just about them. Oh, god. Yeah, okay, it all started with uhm, Jack's mom's oldest sister Margaret. She went into the city with her boyfriend for a romantic night out, right, they were gonna get dinner. And after dinner he surprised her. He had a hotel room at the Waldorf astoria. It's great, it's fantastic, it's a nice hotel. I would do dirty things to stay in that hotel. Turner: You would do dirty things for free. Brandon: Yeah listen, the next morning, the maids come in, boyfriend's dead. Head split open like a pumpkin, or a melon, or a watermelon, and Margaret, she's handing from a chandelier, dead too obviously. Turner: Jesus. She killed herself. Yeah, oh, but you know, Jack's mom, that gets a little nastier. She took much longer to go crazy, you know. She waited, you know, years. And then one night, when Jack was around five or six, his mother just went ballistic. Cut her husband's face open with a razor. Really tore in. Like, gruesome, okay? My parents, they still don't understand how one night a person could be completely normal, friendly, interesting, nice, and then the next, homicidal. They never even found her body, just her clothes, completely soaked in blood. Oh, but the worst one, the worst incident by far is uncle Mike, our uncle Mike. He was in Europe, taking an overnight train from Brussels to Amsterdam. And the next day when the train pulled into the station and the conductor came to open the doors, he found 12 bodies, dead people, just slaughtered, torn-up, cast all over the walls. You know it was just disgusting. There was guts everywhere, it was really just gruesome stuff, awful stuff. The only guy that made it, was uncle Mike, so naturally he's a suspect, but they couldn't find his fingerprints on anything and frankly it didn't make any sense that a scrawny teenager could've killed an entire car full of people, you know? Not like the way, whoever did it, did it, because he tore like jaws off and shit, I mean god... Holy shit, you're fucking related to these people. No, it's through Jack's father, so, I'm not psycho. Whew. All right, that really tired me out. I'm gonna go to bed. You should bundle up, okay, the heat's off. I love you. Shit, fuck... Damn. What the fuck? Brandon. Brandon?! Recorded message: This feels as if it's your beach, yours alone. Don't shoot! Fuck... Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary mother of god. Pray for our sins. Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Reporter on TV: Medics on the scene found the victim's body was cut in half, authorities speculate a rogue black bear... What's with you watching the news? Ssshht! ...may be responsible for the attack, and authorities are urging all residents to remain vigilant while carrying our their daily activities. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Morris Wright. What exactly did you see miss? Uhm, I was waiting for a train to home, and I heard a noise, and then this thing ripped him apart. Brandon: Fuck. Reporter on TV: Now authorities are saying that it was a black bear. Is that what you saw? Uhm, I'm sorry, I can't answer any more questions. Reporter on TV: Morris Wright, the victim, 25 years old, black male. Brandon: Fuck. Reporter on TV: Survived by three sisters and a mother. Brandon: That must've been one big bear, damn. Yeah, yeah. I think with bears you're supposed to stand and scream, I think that's the standard procedure. Uhuh. Hmm, obviously they weren't in the boy scouts. Mike: Please, don't. Hey Jack, uhm, if you wanna keep sleeping outside, that's totally okay, but, could you just let me know? You look like shit. But you're really soft. Have you been using moisturizer? Yeah, it's like i got hundreds at will shooting out my asshole. Rose: I'm done with interviews. I came to... I was at the station last night. Where? On the other side of the track. Rose: Did you see the attack? I heard it. Rose: Bullshit. What are you doing? Why do you have this? Don't touch him. He's sick. So what did you see last night? I didn't get a good look at it. A big gorilla. You don't believe me. No, I do, I do. Was it weird looking? What did it look like? Was it big? Or was it weird and hairy? Man: Rose, who is it? Time for you to go. You are going to leave. Please. It's got my address on it, okay? -I'm not taking it. -Take it. Nobody tells me there's a guest in our house. He just came to talk... Who came to talk? Jack. I'm Gonzo. Well, did she fix you a drink? Rose, did you fix our guest a drink? He didn't want a drink. Just because you're settled and sobered up doesn't mean our guest has to. Jack: No really, I'm fine. Rose pour the scotch, the good scotch. Rocks? You'll have to excuse my wife's poor hospitality. She looks sexy sitting on my couch, but she just isn't into the whole housewife thing. Guess I spoil you too much, huh babe? Guests first. Have a seat. No, you wanna hold that with a strong grip. So what brings you to my castle, Jack? I told your wife i heard the attack. Oh shit, so you were there when that nig... When Morris Wright got killed. It ripped his whole bottom half off, didn't it? Maybe you could tell me what happened to her wedding ring? This is an important investor. I gotta go. Rose, if you will. What up, motherfucker? Gonzo: Oh, I'm ready to bake cakes, I just need some flour. Hey. If you need anything, let me know. Rose: Thank you for coming. Hey, what are you doing? Just rolling a joint. Yeah, it's kind of a big milestone for me, so, if you cannot just hover over me that'd be great. Why are there animal crackers all over the ground? I don't know, I'm not really focused on the animal crackers, because this is my second time smoking, so it's gonna be my first time getting high, so it has to be perfect. See it's, not too tight. You gotta let the grass breathe. Lesson number one. Jack: All right come to my room, all right? Okay, I'll be there as s... Oh, shit. -Howdy-doody. -Jack: Close the door. Okay. What are we watching? Just watch this. Well that's creepy. What is it? Like a YouTube video? No it's from the gopro. Is that the girl from the news? You killed someone, you killed somebody. I think I'm a werewolf. That's a really bad legal defense, all right. We're gonna need to get a lawyer. We need to work on that. Look, look at the hands. Those aren't my hands. Oh, my god. Do you think I'll turn soon? We should call someone. What happened to your dick? That's the real question, you know. Did that transform too? Did it get much bigger? -What? -That would be good. You should definitely call someone. Recorded message: Uh hello, Wade here from Nana's attic. Looks like we've got an item here for you to pick up. Oh fuck, okay. I got some bad news. -Jack: What? -I have some bad news? Jack: What? Uh, we got like four more days of you turning into a werewolf, it turns out. Isn't it only supposed to last like one more night? Brandon: No, the moon only has to basically full for you to transform. And I'm looking at the lunar calendar, and it says that we've got four more nights of basically full moons. We're losing sun. This is-- oh, fucking Christ. Okay, if the sun goes down, I'm dropping you in the woods. Because I don't think I should be in the same car with you. Thanks. What do you expect, I'm not gonna die for you. Well, I mean I'd die for you-- I'm not gonna just die. I'm not even dying for you, you would just be eating me. I'm not gonna be your dinner. I'd sacrifice myself, but that's a different situation. Anyway, I don't wanna have to explain myself. Jack: Hi, I'm here to pick something up. Name? Jack: Jack, Jack luskey. ID? I lost it. We're in a big rush, if there's any way you could hurry up, it'd be great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah. Out there. Jack: Excuse me? Wow. Yeah that's a nice one, hah. Has a little wear and tear, but it's sturdy as hell. Must've been a rich lady to afford a cage like that. Real nice lady too. This is excellent ironwork up here. Son, would you get down from there before you kill yourself? Sorry. Sorry about that. The truck's for me too? I'll drive my car. Fellas? Crystal: I'm so hot. Yeah, yeah you are. You're hotter than your profile picture, that's rare. That's gotta be the nicest thing anybody has ever said to me. Hey, do you know about law and stuff? Well, that's kinda non sequitur, but I guess. I just, I got this friend Jimmy and he was asking me if, you know, if an intruder broke into your house and, and this intruder, say, had a record, and was wanted for murder, and, and you killed them, is that a crime? Well it doesn't matter if they're a murderer, in order to kill somebody you have to feel like your life's in danger. Yeah but it wouldn't matter either way, though, right? He wouldn't get punished if this was a bad person. Okay, well, the Jew that killed Lee Harvey oswald still got in trouble. Are we good? Yeah, fuck, sorry, I'm just a little out of it I guess. I don't know, maybe I'm just not in the mood, I... Well, that's not what this little guy says. Oh, oh... It's funny you say that, 'cause I actually call him little Turner. Oh, so he's little. Oh, he never stays little. That's the trick. I got an idea. Now, what's that. You care if I film this? Only if I get a copy. You are amazing. Hmm, come here. -You stay right here. -Will do. Don't move! All right... Fuck it's not in here. Crystal: Forget about it. I know where it is, just stay right here, don't move! Hold that thought. What the f... Fuck. -Brandon: What's wrong? -No gas. Oh, shit. The car doesn't have a warning light or anything? Man. Jack: How much time do you think we got? Oh god, I don't know, when do you usually transform? I don't know. Do you think we can put the cage in the other car? Nah no way, it's way too small. Ah shit, shit, shit, shit, shit man! Shit, we're in big trouble here! Jack: Relax, we're gonna be fine. No, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be okay, and I'm gonna, you're gonna eat me. Jack: Help me with the cage. See if the werewolf in you eats me, it's not 'cause it's evil, it's because it's a monster. Jack: This is good. Brandon: See, so, if the werewolf in you eats me, it doesn't make it evil, it's just a monster, you know. It doesn't have any control over it. Jack: That sounds pretty evil to me. Brandon: No not if you don't have a choice, see like, you know like the hulk, see with the hulk, you put the hulk in a terrorist base it just destroys everything in it's path, and he's a hero. He's off the hook, in a church, and yeah, he's obviously not a hero. That's what makes it a monster, he doesn't have a choice. Okay, the lock is on. Jack: Good. Take off all your clothes then. Jack: Gimme your watch. Brandon: All right but why, i really like this watch. Just gimme your watch. I won't break it. Okay. All right. -There you go. -Jack: Thanks. And now take off your clothes. Jack: What? Brandon: I need your clothes, you'll rip 'em when you transform. Come on, hurry up, hurry up, please. Jack: All right fine. -Here. -Okay. Thank you. Oh and the jacket, i need the jacket too. Jack: No, I'll keep my jacket. No, no, no you'll tear it when you transform. It's a nice jacket, you don't wanna year that jacket. Jack: I'll take it off before. What if you're not able to, though? It'll be like an experience, yeah? You love experiences, right? I do like ex-- okay. All right. Jack: Get outta here! No, I wanna watch. No, uh, Brandon get out of here, you saw the footage. Ah, fine, okay! All right. -Wait. -Brandon: What? What do I do about food? Uh, oh I got crackers. Jack: Shit. Brandon: I'll see you later, good luck, good bye. Rose: Can you walk Joey? And what would be the point of that, sweetheart? He needs to get out, it's healthy. That dog ain't healthy. And it ain't never gonna be healthy, 'cause I am not spending $10,000 of my money to fix his broke ass. All right. I'll walk him. Come here Joey boy, yes. Let's go for a walk. Let's me and you go for a walk, mommy said, "let's go for a walk." So, let's take you for a walk. Out we go. Holy shit, you wouldn't believe it. His legs must've healed. He ran away. Good night, babe. All right babe, so, this is the Remington 12 Gauge, I'm gonna teach you how to fire this shotgun. Girl as fucking sexy as you, needs to know how to fire a gun, right? Too many predators out there. I know! So you're gonna take-- you got your safety mechanism here, the trigger. This is where you're gonna -throw the shell. -Okay. You wanna throw it in there, you cock it, put it up to your shoulder, find your target and fire. All right, so there's no ammo now, I just want you to learn how to like hold the gun, get a sense of the weight of it. Seems easy enough. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go. Right, you got it. I need like a smaller one. Yeah, I'll get you a mini. All right, so just aim at like them flock of birds out in the distance there, no ammo, but just you know, get a sense of it. Poof! There you go, oh baby, you're so fucking good with a fucking shotgun, hmm! Jack, Jack? Open the fucking cage. Okay, one second. It's open. What is that? Oh, sorry about that. That's nothing. Here you go, you should get in the car, it's warmed up for you. All right, come here, come here. This is so brokeback right now. Oh shit. We can't have him knowing about this. Brandon: Why? Because I fucking killed someone. Oh right, yeah. That's fucked up by the way. Turner: Yeah, morning to you too, Jack. -Hi. -Hi. Hey, hello. So you got a new truck? And what's with the cage? Uh, this is for uncle Mike's cat. Oh my god, I love cats. That cage is for a cat? That cat must be fat as shit. Yeah, well it's an outdoors cat, so it just mostly sticks in the back. -Turner: Uhuh. -Hunts rodents. Can we play with her? Brandon: Sure if you could find her, yeah. Crystal: Kitty, kitty! Brandon: Who's that girl by the way? What her? Yeah, that's uh-- that's crystal. Yeah, she's my slam piece. Met her online and god she just gives me the biggest boners. That's romantic. Yeah, well I'll let you get back to whatever the fuck Houdini trick you're planning, I'm outta here. -Baby! -Brandon: Have fun. Yeah one sec, Brandon. Oh, hey Turner. Hey, man. I feel like we haven't chilled much since we got here. Yeah I know. Hmm. Sorry, I've just not been feeling too well. Yeah, that's all right. By the way, you haven't seen the gopro anywhere have you? No, no. That's funny, 'cause i actually found it in this room, just the other night. All footage mysteriously gone off of it. -That's weird. -Turner: Yeah. Must've been Brandon making one of those movies. One of those movies? Jack: You know. Yeah. Well, this was fun. Let's chill some more, all right? Jack: Definitely. Okay. Oh, can I get my watch back by the way? -Jack: Oh I still need it. -Oh, why? Wow... All right, awesome. I'll set the watch for you. And I'm setting it to 20:22. - There you go. Thanks. I got it. Don't worry. Hi. Can I help you with something? Gonzo: Hey jacky, how you doing? Oh no, this is Brandon. Brandon. What's up, kiddo? Oh nothing much, I'm just mapping out some strategies. Uh, heck strategies. For uh, future tourneys. It's settlers of catan. Do you play? Yeah that's great homie. Listen, where's jacky at? Wait uh, who are you? I'm that motherfucker. Hah, could you be more specific please? It's Gonzo. Tell him to come by my spot. He knows where I'm at. Bring Jack out or I'll crush your skull. Uh, do you know a Gonzo? I don't think he's gonna come, I'm sorry. If it was me, I would go. Ah okay, well this... I don't know if you need to be this rough, sir, I think it's a little unnecessary. So uhm, if you could have him back here before eight o'clock, and that's really important you know. I really-- that's essential. If you could have him before eight. Eight o'clock, okay? Hey jacky, how you doing? Can I get you anything? A cigarette, a scotch? Oh right, you don't drink. Coke? I'm fine, thanks. So. Jacky boy. What did you see that night at the train station? I don't remember much. You don't remember much? Well rose was there. And then the black bear came. And then rose came running to help when she heard some screaming. So my candy-ass, narrow-behind wife, came running when she heard some screaming from a motherfucker she doesn't know, who was being attacked by a black bear. You know Jack, a lot of people are afraid of me. Do you know why a lot of people are afraid of me? Because I'm strong. And yet I am a pillar to the community. You know I donate over 10% of my profits to the boys and girls club? I love kids, jacky. See. The key to my business is know the truth, avoid the sleuth. Now, I avoid the sleuth. And you best believe i wanna know the truth. So I'm only gonna ask you one more time. Was that motherfucker at the train station with my wife? They were there, but not together. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey listen. Next time you see my wife, text me, okay? Baby, I think Jack should stay for dinner. I don't see why not. I can't. Stay. I made plans with my cousin. -Brandon? -Jack: Yeah. Hmm, well. Is that the kid that followed us here? Uh, well. Bon appetite. Hey, ain't that the chick from the news? No, don't be racist. Did you boys ever try a tapenade? I make a mean tapenade. You know, it's my grandmother's recipe actually. When my grandmother died, she passed it down to my mother, and when my mama died, she passed it to my older brother. And when my older brother was murdered, I found the recipe in his wallet. Hmm, so. Brandon, Turner. Where you guys at the train station that night with Jack? Brandon: No, we weren't. What night? Who's this? Could we change the topic? No, I'm sorry what night is this? Could you please pass the tapenade? It seems evident that you boys were not there the night that Morris Wright was tragically killed. Yeah, why were you there, Jack? You never told me you went to a train station. I thought we told each other everything, all of the sudden you're keeping secrets? Why were you at the train station the other night-- well I would like to make a toast. Never mind, I'm sorry. Nah, go ahead Brandon. Make a toast. No it's fine. Make a toast! Okay. Uh... Well, this is a lovely house, it's very exciting to be here, for dinner. And uh, I had a tough semester last semester at college, socially. But I made it, i persevered thanks to my two best friends here, who I love. And uh, it's really exciting, again, to be meeting all of you. Especially Carl. And uh, yeah. I'm excited to see where this goes. Thank you. Ah. To friendship. And whatever the fuck that little guy was talking about. And now that our palates have been cleansed, the tapenade. In a few seconds meet me in the kitchen. I'm gonna go check on the chicken. This is some fantastic tapenade. I think it's excellent, really great. It's always great. Do you need help with that? Can you help me? -Yeah. -Not with that. He killed the dog. He killed Joey. Uhm, I'm so sorry. And now he thinks i was with Morris. I told him you weren't, so there's no way he'll know. I'm gonna start showing soon. You're pregnant? Babies cost a lot more than dogs. He wouldn't kill a baby. Yeah, if it were his. Can you help me? Gonzo: Rose, we're two sets in, and no entree. Please. I don't-- get the rice. Turner: And that is the first time Brandon ever sucked on a dick. That's a true story. I'm sure. Only last week? Turner: Yeah man, it was just last week, she was like, who's this little kid, and I was like, oh, his name is Brandon. Brandon: I don't remember saying exactly those words. Turner: Yeah, whatever, you were drunk. Ah, anyway, that looks nice. Say, what kind of scotch are we drinking by the way? Gonzo: Currently Johnnie Walker blue. Turner: I've heard of Johnnie Walker black. Gonzo: Welcome to the blue. Son. I'm feeling kinda sick. Brandon can get I the keys. Oh yeah, yeah. You're leaving before the entree Jack? Yeah, stay for the entree, Jack. I would, I'm just feeling very nauseous. Thanks for the hospitality. I enjoyed the tapenade. Okay, we gotta follow him. Why, to watch him vomit? No, no, something ain't right, and I wanna fix it. It'd be really rude. We can't just leave. Ahem, excuse me, Mr. Gonzo, uhm, may I please be excused. Now what is going on here fellas? Did you not enjoy the tapenade. No, no, I did very much, very much, thank you again for that, I'm just, concerned with my friend. I wanna make sure he's okay. Sure, go. Hey Carl, I'll call you later. Thank you for dinner. Wait, this isn't the fucking way. Oh, I'm taking the scenic route. The fucking scenic route? Do I look like I have time to take the scenic route? I'm calling the fucking cops. No, please don't call the cops, no cops. Fuck you, man. You're trying to protect him with that cage bullshit. I know something is going on. I'm not trying to protect him, I'm just not trying to bust him, that's all okay. You know, it's Jack. It's gonna be one huge misunderstanding, I can feel it. No, no, no you have exactly two minutes to get there before I call the fucking cops. Fine, call the police. Let 'em come and find Jack vomiting, big deal. That's not a crime. I mean, we're the ones with weed on us. You think that's a smart idea to call the police when we have weed on us? It's not, it's not a smart idea. Turner: Go, nine. Fine, I don't care. -Turner: One. -It's your own funeral. -One! -All right, all right, okay. Stop. I'll take you. Goddamn right you will. Ssshht, ssshht, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up. I don't hear anything. That's really good news, that's such good news, because that, our job is done here then. That's it. I don't think so. I wanna know what's in here. All right, wait one second. Will you, wait, wait. Let's not go in there. Why? I have, I've had some homosexual feelings lately towards you... Turner: Oh my god, Brandon. And I wanted to talk to you about it. It can hurt our friendship. Don't fucking lie to me Brandon. Don't fucking lie to me. I will open this damn door. Don't fucking lie to me-- all right, fine, I won't lie! What, what? Jack's in there and he's a werewolf now. And he's gonna turn into a werewolf, and then we go in and he kills us. Now you are goddamn full of shit. He'll kill us! Get off, get off me Brandon, I'm not fucking kidding. Now open that goddamn door. All right, fine. Fuck man. Brandon: Hey Jack, it's us. What the fuck are you guys doing here? What the fuck are you doing in here? I'm sleeping here. What kind of fucked up psycho-creep are you? Turner, you gotta listen to me, go upstairs now, please. Brandon, help me out! No, don't talk to Brandon all right. I know you two are full of secrets. Now, tell me what the hell is going on. Turner, I will explain everything tomorrow. Right now, you just gotta get outta here. Well, this wouldn't be the first time a member of your family has had some explaining to do. Oh, shit. Turner: Hey, you know, get back here! -Brandon, get the lock! -Brandon: Oh, shit! No, no, no, I know something is up man. This fucking cage, and you're staking out at night, and the bloody gopro. Turner, you should... Aahh! -Turner: Oh, my god! -Brandon: Shit. Turn the lock! Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh, god! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh my god, oh fuck. Fuck! Brandon! Brandon. Brandon come on, come on. Come on, Brandon, Brandon, come on. Come on. Come on. Brandon, hey, hey! We're gonna get you to the hospital. You're gonna be okay. -You should've seen yourself. -Jack: That wasn't me. You looked awesome. Jack: It was the werewolf, I'm sorry. Come on. Call, please call a prostitute, man. Why? I don't wanna die a virgin. Do you think I'll have enough blood for a boner? It's gonna be okay. You're gonna have live. Come on Brandon, come on Brandon. Come on Brandon, pick up the fucking phone. Come on. Fuck! Come on Brandon, fuck! Mike: Hey, it's Mike. I haven't heard from you. I hope you're okay. Look, we had a pact. The gene was supposed to die with us. I thought that was clear. I don't know what you're trying to sustain here. Sedating Jack, hoping he finds the cage. This is no way to live. What the fuck is going on? The lady, why was she here? What else do you know? Did she say anything? And the cage? Why now? Welcome to Nana's attic. You will never get the answers you want by asking so many goddamn questions. So you know something? No, that was just a piece of advice. Unfortunately in this case I genuinely don't have an idea of what the fuck you're talking about. You got a map? Where you headed? West. West? You don't need a map to follow the sunset. I'm going to Colorado. That's a pretty good road trip. You'll be on i-80 west for about 2,000 miles till you hit the mountains. I don't imagine you would make a trip like that by yourself. I'll be fine. No son, I don't think you will be. What about that nice lady who bought you those nice things? Maybe she could go with you? Or what about that friend of yours? The strange one. They're not coming. Son. 10 years ago i had a lot of shit. My wife was battling cancer. My son went bankrupt in the city. And my momma couldn't remember my name. A man is measured by the weight of the people leaning on him. But too many people leaning can knock you down. You're being a bitch. I'm just going west. West, north, south, fucking Antarctica. No matter where you go, you're being a bitch. Not so fast, son. This makes two times you've been in my store and you haven't bought a goddamn thing. My advice may be cheap, but it ain't free. We'll fix the problem tomorrow. I forgive you. Turner: Fuck, goddammit. Remember, your worst quality, can also be your best, okay? Promise me something, Jack. Don't be afraid. If the werewolf in you eats me, that doesn't make it evil. It's just a monster, it doesn't have any control over it, that's what makes it a monster, it doesn't have a choice. Oh, what's up? Do you have anything else? Not yet. You gotta trust me. Hold on to this. And drive over to my place. See you in the morning. Crystal: Check this out! What, oh babe thank you, but I'm just not very hungry, I appreciate it though. Okay, uhm, well, I guess I'll just put it in the fridge, uhm, I'm probably gonna go. What, no! Why? Well I don't really know why I even came after the last time. Oh come on, I'm sorry, and I'm sorry about that, that was total horse shit on my part, and I know I disappointed you the other night, and I want tonight to be special for us, all right? Can you give me one more chance? I guess. Yeah? You do look a little off and I feel bad. All right, that's all right, how about tonight, you, me, and little Turner hang out. Hmm, what do you think? Hmmm... I mean I didn't drive over here for nothing, so. Oh, I know, oh I know, I'll make it worth your while, all right? Okay, but this is your last chance. Okay, so why don't you get ready? And I'll meet you upstairs in five minutes. -Crystal: Sounds good. -All right. Oh fuck... Jacky what are you doing? Jack: I'm just getting myself some scotch. You have got some balls coming here tonight. You lying motherfucker. Well, enjoy that scotch. Because I am about to beat your ass. What the fuck? I am going to end you, motherfucker! Hmm, damn. All righty, let's do this. Turner? Well Jack, it seems you like to play games. Let's play one of my favorites. Now the rules are simple. My boys are gonna press pressure points on you. You are gonna scream. And then I'll give you this stress ball, you can squeeze it, hopefully it'll help calm you down. Carl told me. You lied to me, Jack. You shouldn't lie. Boys. Turner? Babe? Turner? I swear to god if you scare me I'm not gonna suck your dick. Oh yeah, you feel that, huh? Do you get the point, Jack? Don't lie to me Jack. Never! What the fuck is this guy--? Shit. What the fuck? Fuck! Fuck this shit. Oh shit, I shot Carl. Motherfucker! Carl man, are you okay? Shit, motherfucker, don't you know how to aim? Oh my god, is that? Turner, it's the cat. Turner, I found the cat. You're gonna miss it. Holy fuck... Jack... Crystal? Holy shit! Oh, baby. What the hell did you do to me last night? Oh, I can't remember a goddamn thing. All right, baby where are you? You want some milk? Oh! Oh, no... What the fuck. Motherfucker! Fuck! Jack: Where's rose? Follow me. No, I'll follow you. Inside. In the barn. In the cage. Jack: What are you doing? Just get in the cage. Still got that watch of yours? Jack: Yeah. Give it to me. You got an alarm set for 20:22. I'll see you at 20:20. Get up. Over there. Right there. Get out of the cage, Jack. Get out of the cage, Jack. Over there. Jack: Turner, you gotta put me back in the cage. No, no, no, time to confess, Jack. And you don't have much time. Turner, I gotta get back to that cage. Turner: One more step and I'll shoot you right now. You won't shoot me. I'll shoot you right fucking now. Just like I shot your mom. There's my confession. Now answer my questions. Did you kill Brandon? What do you want out of it? Did you kill Brandon? Yes. Did you kill Morris? Yeah. And did you kill crystal? No. She was torn up just like Brandon was. Did you kill her? Turner I swear, i didn't kill crystal. Okay, I gotta get back to that cage. No, no, no one is gonna believe there's a werewolf, unless it's caught on camera. Look at him. All these murders are getting put on the werewolf, that I'm gonna kill with my silver bullet. Silver bullet? What? Five seconds till I'm a hero. Turner, that's not gonna fucking work. You gotta shoot me now, kill me now-- shut the fuck up Jack, shut the fuck up! Oh, god! I'm the good guy here. He killed Morris. I will kill you both, you can only kill a werewolf with a silver bu-- I'm sorry. Get in the fucking cage. I'm not gonna make it. Get in the cage. Mike: Welcome to the family.
