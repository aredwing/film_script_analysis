Bars in the daytime are like women without makeup. THE LILAC BAR Not like that! You got married in a church, so kiss like foreigners do. That's right! Hurry up. Not like that. Try again. Stop teasing. He's sweating. I'm surprised Miyuki got married first. She loved working here. Marriage is what every woman wants. Not me. I'm going to save some money and open my own place. Shall we cut the cake? Shouldn't we wait for Mama? Mama? We're waiting for you. What? Well, please hurry. The owner's chewing out Mama and Mr. Komatsu. Mr. Komatsu? I wonder why. It's obvious. "You're not making enough money!" I guess it isn't easy being a mama. Sales were down last month and the month before. Why? Mama's doing her best. Isn't it because Mr. Minobe stopped coming in? Sorry my phone call took so long. Mama, do you know where Mr. Minobe goes these days? Yuri's bar. The same Yuri who worked for you. Minobe has contacts at big companies. If you call him, he'll come by. I wonder. Your job is to make money for me. If sales are down again this month, I'll replace you. Understand? Don't be so prim. Yuri goes all out. He's trying to humiliate me! Telling me to do such a thing! But business has plummeted. Even so, I won't call him. It's not just Mr. Minobe. I've never begged anyone to come in. It's not pride. I hate doing that. I hate liquor, yet I drink my fill every night. Isn't that "going all out"? Get your own place. Where would I find a million yen? Mama, don't worry. Any of the 700 bars in the Ginza would hire you. What's that? I hate that sound. I've got a bill to collect on. Regards to Miyuki. - Mama! - What happened? Suicide. The Bluebird hostess. The fortune-teller was right. Fortune-teller? I took her to a fortune-teller who predicted misfortune, and it hit her hard. Something awful's happened! I heard. I'm sorry I'm late. The Bluebird was heavily mortgaged. - I heard it was a love triangle. - Not debt? Her patron and her lover had a fight. How old was she? Forty-three, but she looked younger. - Aging's hard on a woman. - I'd better save up for the old folks' home. Enough of that talk. Sing, somebody! We've got a train to catch. Thanks for everything. I'll go see them off. He could at least buy second-class tickets. Try to think more positively. It won't be easy! Be grateful you got a chance to marry. Compared to handling drunks, his mother will be easy. Mr. Matsui, take good care of her. We're not far. Please come visit. Thank you. As the office girls are leaving work, our work is just beginning. This is nice. Or is it too plain? No, but it's a bit matronly. Really? I'd still like it. You sure? Twin matches - good luck! Stop acting like a cheap cabaret girl. It's vulgar. You sure know how to eat. You just ruined the taste. - Other shops sell these for less. - Ours are better. I'll take these. How about a discount? You'll ruin me! How much is this? Don't say that. Just come by. We haven't seen you in so long. I'm Ionely. I really am. Welcome! Don't bother. He's from the savings plan. Sorry I'm late. So it's 100 yen from Sachiko, and 200 from Kiyomi. It's all here, pops. Night fell... I hated climbing those stairs more than anything. But once I was up, I would take each day as it came. Mr. Minobe, welcome. You're quite a stranger. You called, so here I am. You'd completely disappeared. Pardon me a moment. Mr. Minobe's here. Did you call him? I said it was the Lilac Bar calling, not you. Same thing. He's my customer. Don't meddle. It's business. Just don't. Do you like this tiepin? Very nice. You're not even looking. I bought it for you. For me? Put it on. - No, give it to a customer. - But - Good evening. They're cracking down. It's harder to get the goods. - You mean Tetsu got caught? - Yeah. Next time I'll be the one sent to the slammer. You've got it good here, surrounded by girls, and with a regular paycheck. That girl's crazy about you. - I'm not interested in the girls here. - Really? You can't succeed as a manager here if you fiddle with the goods. Maybe, but what a waste! Welcome. You've got new girls, but this place is dead! That's because it's still early. Right, Mama? He's hinting it's because he's been away. That's right. So come by every night. - This place is so routine. How rude! You can't take him seriously. He'll always act mean and then turn on the charm. - Is that true? - That's my... routine. But seriously, I've run a lot of companies. Any place headed downhill is always depressing like this. I see. Is Yuri's place lively? You bet. Not like here. Want to see for yourself? Please. I could learn a lot. Welcome! Is this seat okay? Mari. Mr. Inagaki came by last night. Yuri worked for me until last summer. She has a gift for handling men. Forgive me for neglecting you. Care for a drink? My stomach's been bothering me. - Swimming in dough, eh? - Sure. Maybe I'll lend it out. Can you teach me to calculate interest? Don't imply that's my line of work. - It's great you're so busy. - Thanks. Actually, I barely scrape by. Liar. Didn't you buy a new car? A used one that barely runs. It uses so much gas it drives me crazy. - Still, you're succeeding. - See, she - Be quiet and drink. Mama and I have a lot to talk about. Mama, that kimono is stunning. Those stripes really suit you. I gasped when I saw you come in. Your dress is lovely too. Enough. I'm not paying to listen to this chatter. Well, hello there! Hello. I used to see him at your place. A brewery executive. He's very nice. Mr. Minobe. Sorry I've been out of touch. Busy as usual? Only at night. Business is dead. Always the kidder. Excuse me. He's president of an appliance firm. I taught him how to use a radio during the war. Now his company's thriving. Shall I introduce you? Yes, please. No problem. I'm leaving for Izu tonight to go golfing. Come along. I can't golf. What would be the point? I'll play the golf, okay? It's too sudden. Your place just phoned. A guest... Thank you. I'll be going. I'll be here. Phone me. Leaving already? I'll drive you back. Don't bother. Walking's faster. Please come again. Take care. Mama, scouting out the enemy? I know where you're going. Please, go ahead. It's my first time here. Yuri won't stop calling. I'll drop by later. Really? I'll be waiting. What were you and Mama talking about? Gimme a refill. What to do? The time to decide was looming. I went to work at a new bar. Only a few leaves were left on the sycamores. How nice to see you! When did you arrive from Osaka? Last night. An emergency shareholders meeting. I see. This way, please. - I had a hard time finding the place. - Forgive me. I lost your map card. Welcome. He drinks Black & White with water. Don't forget. - Nice place. - Thank you. Making more than before? It's always money with you. That's the most important thing. Foreigners ask for the price list before they even drink a glass of juice. And they pay up front. Did Mama give Minobe the brush-off? Where'd you hear that? Besides, how would we know? You're well trained. Is my face red? I may look sturdy, but I can't drink at all. Then why come to a bar? I can't stand sitting at home once the lights go on. But aren't you married? Not even close. Should I call Mama? That's okay. I'm not her only customer. You're so nice! I'd like to marry a man like you. I'm honored. It's true. Handsome men are conceited. May I have a drink? Sorry to neglect you. Yukiko, could you go to the bar? Have a drink on me. Thanks. Mama doesn't have a patron? No, she's too virtuous. She'll cave in eventually. A woman's a woman. Want to bet? - On what? - On who'll get her. All her regular guests are here. Let's see. That old man from Osaka has the most money... but she likes the banker best. Odds are on him. What about the fat fellow? Not even in the running. Did you put on a little weight? Hardly, with all my debts. That can't be. Nothing's harder than running a 30-man factory. Is that so? You're thinner. Am I? It's stressful changing bars. - But even prettier. - Thank you. - You like tempura? - I love it. I'll treat you tomorrow. Can't. I have to see a customer off at the airport. Some other time then. I'm sorry. Welcome! Did Mr. Goda arrive? Mr. Fujisaki's a regular too. Yes. That guest told me to hold this for him. There's 500,000 yen inside! Don't fall for that. It's true! Silly. He's just trying to get you to go out with him. It's just for show? Leave it with Komatsu. How about dinner tomorrow? - What time? - Any time. I'll call you. Leaving so soon? Stay a bit. I have to meet someone. Keep the drinks flowing for my men there. How about dinner tomorrow? Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. Take care. Between 11:30 and midnight, the Ginza's 16,000 hostesses head home in droves. The best go by cab... the second-rate take the train... and the worst go off with their customers. Junko. Tomoko, you'll miss the last train. Goodness! Bye now. You forgot this. Silly me! It's for my son's school trip tomorrow. Good-bye. - Good night. - Good-bye. Welcome. - Welcome. - Thank you. The sign's still on outside. I'm sorry. She's drunk again. I'll take her to my apartment. Keiko, isn't that kimono a bit plain? Is it? Wear something flashier. The Carton Bar. A call for you. What is it? No, we can't provide geisha this late. Give them some sushi, then kick them out. I'm busy, so I'll be brief. I paid the 170,000 yen your guests owed at the Lilac so you'd be free to work for me here. It's just a formality, but please put your seal on this receipt. I'll collect the money soon and pay you back. I'll be going. No need to see me out. Did the owner leave? I hate to ask, but could you collect on bills again tomorrow? She'll probably want interest too. I'll get a cab. Will you bring Junko? Back home... I felt tired and a little drunk. My rent is 30,000 yen, a lot for one person. But for us Ginza hostesses, an apartment's a fashionable accessory... just like expensive clothes and perfumes. Junko! Oh, it's you. Mama wanted to come, but relatives arrived from Nagoya. She asked me to extend her apologies. I see. We'd appreciate payment soon, sir. I've overspent this month. I'd prefer to pay these two bills next month. I understand. But they're bills from the old bar, so... Mama's having a hard time too. Yes, her aunt and uncle just came from Nagoya. She asked me to apologize. Me? I'm watching her place. But please do visit our bar again. Okay? Good-bye. The man from Osaka was furious. Was he? It's still easier than saying no to his face. You're right. I just learned a new trick. Mama... who's your favorite customer? I don't know. I do. Mr. Fujisaki? I don't dislike him. But in our business we have to treat every man like a lover. You can't love just one man. Too bad. I could love just one rich man. That 500,000 yen from last night - I can still see it. Let's not talk shop. Here. Thank you. Your omelettes are as good as a restaurant's. My late husband loved omelettes. I hate to cook. - Even rice? - I use an electric cooker. I thought you'd say that. You still have to know how to use it. You'll have a hard time when you get married. I had it hard at first. At first? Oh, when you got married? I've always wanted to ask: What was your husband like? Handsome? There's a photograph in the family shrine. May I? Isn't he good-Iooking? He's kind of chubby. I'm disappointed. He wasn't really handsome, but he was so kind. Maybe because he was ten years older. I was just out of high school. I caused him such grief with my selfishness. He died so soon. I wish I'd been nicer. But he looked so healthy. Was it illness? No, he got hit by a truck. Poor man. It's hard to forget someone you lose so unexpectedly. Mama... is it true you put a love letter in his urn? Who told you that? Mr. Komatsu said you told him once when you were drunk. It's a beautiful, romantic thing to do. When I heard that, I respected you so much. Silly girl. It's not true. That's Komatsu for you. It was in a novel I read. A novel? What a letdown! But my husband was such a good person. Is that why nobody else can win your heart? It's not that. It just seems so dirty. It's not my way. If a woman does such things, her charm disappears. Aren't you Ionely sometimes? Sure. But I have a brandy and go to sleep. That kind of fever soon passes. You really have some self-control! I clench my teeth so hard they hurt. Honest? You're so gullible! Oh, you! A woman shouldn't be loose. That's one rule I've followed. I'm not a prude, but if I let go once, it'd be too hard to stop. Maybe I'm just a coward. Don't sit there thinking. Your food's getting cold. Hello? Mother? Just a second. Junko, please get the door. What is it? This is too sudden. The kimono-maker's bill is due today. Wait a couple days. I'll send it with your monthly allowance. Listen, did you make your pickled cabbage? Bring some when you come. Don't catch cold. Good morning. How'd it go? Let me eat first. I'm starving. Fujisaki finally paid, but Mr. Goda won't pay unless you ask him personally. He flashed the money but wouldn't hand it over. I'll go see him tomorrow. The usual inn at Tsukiji? Won't he try to seduce you? They try all the time, but it can only work if I let them. Famous last words. You've heard of Nobuko at Club 8? She wouldn't even give in to a cabinet member. But then she fell in love with some down-and-out guitarist. Now she's a maid in a love hotel. I started as a busboy in the Ginza ten years ago. I've seen a lot like her. What's your point? Just sharing my experience. Good marmalade. Thanks for coming. Yesterday I had to take five kimonos over to Yuri's place. Five? Her business must be booming. Care to buy any yourself? I just finished paying for my last one. Pay whenever you can. I trust you. Men are so strange. You always rush off afterwards. It's bad manners, especially the first time. Can't you stay another hour? Don't get lipstick on me. You're like a politician. You don't keep your word. "The girls in my care are precious goods not to be touched." That only applies to women like Mama. Oh, that's nice! Fooling around with me while going on about her. There aren't many like her in the Ginza. Oh, I see. What? You did to me what you couldn't do to her. Nonsense. Hurry and get ready. Hand it over. - What? - The money. You said you liked me. I'm a pro. I charge the men I like too. It pays better than a normal job, but I have to spend so much on myself. It's a vicious circle. It makes no sense. The owner takes it all anyway. How old are you? Don't ask. Old enough. Thirty? That's the turning point in a woman's life. The time to decide whether to marry or open your own bar. Tell me, would you like your own place? You're joking. I'll consider it, if that's what you want. I couldn't. Yes, you could. You could make it work. How much would it take? Give me a figure. Even tiny bars in the Ginza cost over a million. Then it's no problem. Some money I lent out came back before it was due. An honest fellow. See? In cash. Just a little windfall. My wife will grab it if I take it home. And the banks only pay 6%. If you're serious about setting up shop, take it. You'd lend it to me? Well... maybe even give it to you. I come to Tokyo several times a month. It's a waste staying all alone in a big room like this. Maybe we could... reach an understanding. I don't want to force you into anything. Think it over. Ask yourself if you want to spend your life working for others. Mama... come closer. Will you dine now? No, thank you. I'm just leaving. I should be going. I'll have an answer next time I see you. Hello? Komatsu? I'd like your advice. It's not a bad proposition. You approve? That's irrelevant. So you'll finally get a place of your own. You were a cashier when I recruited you five years ago. Time flies. Now it's either marriage or my own bar. No respectable man would marry me now. I've made up my mind. So you're giving in to the old man after holding out for five years. What's so funny? If I was going to do it that way, there are better men than Mr. Goda. I'll solicit subscriptions. If ten men put up 100,000 yen each, that would make a million. I'll deduct their drinks from what I owe them. Now I approve! Being a kept woman is stupid. I'll chip in too. You will? Thanks. But I don't want to burden you. Mr. Sonoda, Mr. Ito, and Mr. Matsubara - they're good for 200,000 yen each. That's 600,000. The rest are small spenders. But Fujisaki's a banker. He could put up 200,000. No, not him. Why not? No special reason. You feel awkward asking him? Something like that. I know a good bar for sale. - Where? - Shall I show you? Please. THE CONGA BAR The down payment is cheap. Just one drawback: You share the restroom with the sushi place downstairs. No pressure, but I've got two other interested parties. - We'll talk it over. - I'll be eating downstairs. Well? It needs some fixing up, but it's a good place to start. I'll be your bartender. - You're too expensive. - Not at first. But sharing the restroom with a cheap sushi place - would my customers come? They'll come to see you. Let's do a test run. Order something. A dry martini? Coming right up. Komatsu, your secret's out. The lipstick on your shirt. Lipstick? Can't avoid an occasional smudge with so many women around. So what do you say? Well... We can't quite decide. I've got nicer places. What a surprise. Long time no see. I'd like to talk to you. How about some tea? Are you still angry at me? Angry at you? About what? I want to apologize for taking your customers. I'm sorry. It was the only way to keep my place going. Don't worry about it. Minobe still comes? Yes. Maybe it's this light, but you look thinner. Just between us, I'm deep in debt. It's taking its toll. You must be joking. I heard you bought five kimonos for Christmas. I don't have them anymore. I bought them on credit, then pawned them for cash. Clever, huh? Isn't that risky? I sold my car and put away my golf clubs. I borrowed so much to get started that now I'm in a pinch. Don't laugh. What'll you do? I've decided to die. Isn't that a great idea? They say sleeping pills work quite well. Yuri! Just kidding. It'll be a staged suicide. I won't actually die. I'll just fake it to hold off creditors. Shocked? Not shocked. Impressed. I thought, with your place doing so well, your view of the world might be a little too rosy. But you've tasted struggle too. I respect that. You're embarrassing me. What a strange conversation. Whatever happens, don't give up. By the way, I'm going to open my own bar. Really? That's wonderful! Let's drink to that. Women working in the Ginza fought desperately for survival. It was a battle I couldn't afford to lose. On my days off, I took my pledge book from one company to the next. Some men promised more than I expected, some less. But I didn't want to discuss money with the man I really cared about. A pledge book? Well, well. Your money will be repaid little by little in the form of your bar tab. So we have to come drink to get repaid? Smart idea. I'm not trying to coerce anyone. Joking aside, I'd like to help, especially since it's you, but a bank can't lend 200,000 without collateral. However, I can put up I may be branch manager, but it's other people's money. May I speak to you, sir? Excuse me. I shouldn't have come. Collecting on bills? Depressed? I don't feel down. My client didn't pay, but at least I ran into you. How about some tea? What a nice fragrance. What's your perfume? Black Narcissus. Must cost a lot. It's stronger here than at the bar. Really? So you're opening your own place? Has everyone contributed? Nothing but promises so far. I'm counting on you too. You're putting me in a spot. Why? Well... No, I'd better not. Come on. Tell me. All right. A bar is no place for you. I'd be happier seeing you marry a good man. You're the first to say that. Everyone else encouraged me. It's not the money. But I always feel sorry seeing you with drunks. I don't know how you got into this line of work, but you belong in a nice home. Don't be offended. It's just my opinion. Put me down for 100,000 yen. Christmas time again. How depressing. I have to buy new clothes, sell tickets. Well, well. Long time no see. Kiyomi! How are you? I'm fine, but the Lilac is going under. Did you hear? Yuri did a terrible thing. I know. You do? She committed suicide! No, she was just faking. Can she fake being dead? Dead? Yes. I just got back from paying my respects. She put sleeping pills in brandy. Not too many, but with that much alcohol... I'm sorry she was so much trouble to you. Not at all. I just came to offer my condolences. I only sold her a slip and some panties. You can pay me in due course. I'll discuss it with my relatives. If I'm not paid soon, I'll be fired. We'll do what we can. Please. I'm very sorry. I should have stopped her. No, it was just her bad luck. One way or another, it would have come to this. Forgive me for saying so, but I told her from the start not to work as a hostess. Besides, she was too young to own her own place. Even a man who works his whole life can't be sure of success. How much harder for a woman on her own. Stretch yourself too far and you're bound to fail. Excuse me. I've come on behalf of Mr. Minobe. I'm Yuri's mother. I apologize for all the trouble she caused you. I'm deeply sorry for your loss. It's very difficult to have to say this, but selling the bar only covers part of the 1.5 million that Yuri owed Mr. Minobe. He requests that you pay the remaining 300,000 yen. I have the papers with me. We need your seal. Must I do it today? Her funeral's not even over yet! I'm merely Mr. Minobe's employee. Why do you think she died? You kept pressing her for money. She thought a suicide attempt could hold you off. But instead... she really died! What do you need Never mind that. Can you get it? Ask the owner. I can make a lot on the deal. It's a manager's duty to help. If you get the money, we can go to the hot springs together. Forget it. You're in love with Mama, aren't you? I don't normally tell strangers' fortunes, but since you know the lingerie shop owner... I see the word sake in the back of your mind. Is there some connection with your work? Yes. I work in a bar. That explains it. What do you want to know? It's about starting a bar of my own. Pick a card. Not for a couple of years. You'd be rowing a boat against the current. Time solves everything. Wait patiently. You'll soon receive a marriage proposal. A proposal? I came to work and forgot about everything. Welcome. Don't you have the wrong place? You're terrible, hiding out here and not even calling me. This is Mr. Horiuchi. He's with Asahi Steel. - Pleased to meet you. - My pleasure. Even more beautiful than I was told. He's a big shot in steel. I thought you two should meet. I'm indebted to him. I see. You'd better be careful. He's no good. Don't go telling him the truth. Poor Yuri. Yes. She should have told me about her debts. It was only a million or so. I could have helped. You sold her place. Squeezing her mother for 300,000! That should be your condolence gift! What's your problem? Tomoko, get me a drink. Straight. Don't worry. I'll pay for it. You really can't hold your liquor! Mama, the manager wants to see you. What? Don't be so nasty to Mr. Minobe. You want me to flatter him? Forget it. Customers pay for a good - I said forget it! I quit the Lilac because of him. Who is he anyway? He drives Yuri to desperation, then comes here like nothing's happened. I hate him! He makes me sick! Not tonight! I can still smell the incense from Yuri's funeral. Just being next to him is an insult to her memory! There are limits, even in business! Stop being so emotional. This is a bar. People pay to have a good time. So what? Listen to me! You get paid to show men a good time. If you don't like it, take off that kimono and work in an office and starve! Shut up! Komatsu, Mama's throwing up blood! Blood? Mama, are you all right? Call a doctor! Get a cab! Sorry to bother you. It was a small ulcer. Four weeks passed. I spent both Christmas and New Year's in bed, and the following week as well. Excuse me. Dad. May I ask your name? So good of you to come. I should have come sooner. But the holidays were so busy with the bar and the place in Akasaka. I'm sorry I caused you such trouble. I asked Komatsu about you. You look well. Thank you. It's not serious. I see. I came across some turtle soup. I thought it might do you good. Buy some fruit with this. Thank you. This is my first time in these parts. You can still see traces of the old Tokyo. This may not suit your taste. Unfortunately Mother is out. You needn't have. Look what she brought. Thank you. Heat this for her tonight. Even turtle soup costs a fortune these days. Thank you for this precious gift. Your brother seems nice. Yes, almost too nice. Is that his son downstairs? Yes. He had polio. Really? He has such a cute face. Don't go far. He's starting school this year. There's an operation that could help him, but... It must be hard on you too. What about your apartment? - Junko's looking after it. Don't worry about the bar. Your health's more important. Well, I should be going. Taxes are coming due. Could you do some collecting? I'm sorry. I've been meaning to. Ah, it's you! I'm not supposed to let anyone in, but you're all right. Nice place. The rent must be high. Is that a present? Thanks. So this is her bedroom. It's still warm. Put that down! - Is Mama out? - She's in the hospital. And I came all this way. Which hospital? - I don't know. - Don't be ridiculous. She didn't tell me. Why not? Is she trying to hide something? She's not that type. There's nobody but you. The nerve! Don't mock your elders. What are you doing here? - Watching the place. This is a waste of time. I'm going. Don't be so gruff. You can have some tea even if she isn't here. Don't be naughty or Mama will scold you. Tea's ready. What were you doing? Checking to see if Mama has a lover. Oh, you! You call this tea? Tastes like medicine. You'd be hopeless as a bride. I don't plan to get married. - You want to stay single? - You're so slow. I'm disappointed. What do you mean, slow? I mean dumb. You're the dumb one. I'm going to have my own bar someday. That's my dream. Dreams are nice, but first take a long look in the mirror. That's rude! Speaking of which, Mama never replied to my offer. Did she say anything to you? - No. Listen... What are you doing? I want my own bar. I feel my youth fading by the day. Sick people always say that. Maybe I should go to the beauty salon. It's been so long. Want a massage? That's all right. I don't have much to do. Lie down. I hate to impose. Here? How's that? I used to give my boss massages when we went on business trips. Brother... were you this kind to your wife? Of course. She was my wife. That's why she left you... and her own son. I'm home. Welcome back. The owner came by to see me. Really? She gave me this. You take it. You sure? Thanks a lot. How did it go? Let me smoke first. Don't smoke the butts. Take these. Thanks. Life now really makes me long for the old days. Those were good times. Your father had the fish market. We sent you to a good school. What did my sister-in-law say? That she'd never return to a family like this. That's how couples are these days. You don't have to run off. Emiko asked about you. "How's his job as an insurance salesman?" You've wound up like this because you're too nice! You go to court again next week, right? I ran into your lawyer at the bus stop. Why didn't you say anything? I've troubled you enough. It's a little late for that now. Why'd you affix your seal to a receipt you knew nothing about? Did you have to do everything your boss said? That's right! I'm too nice! I'm just a fool! They were selling these sweet bean cakes. They're hard to find. Have one. No, thanks. They're good. I said no. Fine. I won't force you, but I got them just for you. I guess you only like fancy things these days. It's not that. I'm just not hungry. Fine. But you really can't afford to be so extravagant. What do you mean, extravagant? Aren't you? You keep a fancy apartment instead of living at home. That's not an extravagance. Then what is it? Tell me! Customers come to the Ginza for a taste of luxury. Satisfying that craving is what we're paid for. Apartments beyond our means, taxis, expensive perfumes - it all serves that purpose. Men wouldn't be interested if they knew I lived in a place like this. Somehow it would show, no matter what I did. Isn't it a shame you're stuck with us? Why even come home? Go to some expensive hospital. Mother. Isn't it the truth? That would suit your silk kimono better! Mother, how many times must I tell you? Kimonos aren't a luxury for me! I know - it's business! That's right! Looking good means good customers. In the Ginza, appearance is everything. You wouldn't understand. I'm actually quite frugal. Flashy kimonos would get more attention, but I can't wear them in the daytime, so I buy plain ones instead. You have no right to call me extravagant! I said I understood! Then stop saying it! Who'd ever want to work in a bar? Drinking till I'm sick, being a plaything for men. I haven't enjoyed a single day since I started. Even lying here, thoughts of bills torment my dreams. I'm miserable! But how else could I send you If you can find a better job, tell me and I'll quit! Go ahead and insult me! I'm a burden on you! Just leave us! Stop it! Just go downstairs! It's all my fault. Keiko doesn't have to pay for the lawyer. I'll just go to prison. Don't say that. I'll ask again when she's in a better mood. Take this. That's all right. Don't tell her. Excuse me. My name is Sekine. Mr. Sekine? No, I'd be ashamed if he saw me here. Tell him I have a fever. How can I do that? Please just get rid of him! I see. That's too bad. I just had business nearby and wondered how she was. I'm sorry she's not being more polite. It's all right. Please give her this. It must be hard on you, but please take good care of her. What a kind man. How'd he find out I was here? What does it matter? Fat people are usually nice. His wife is certainly lucky. He's not married. You don't say. Doesn't he remind you of Yasuo? He was such a kind son-in-law. I'm going back to work next week. But you're not - I have to. That's why the owner came by. I see. Would you talk to your brother's lawyer first? Money will settle it. Help him out. No! I have no money. LAW OFFICES Despite what I'd said, I couldn't let my brother go to jail. I'd only been away from the bar a month, but I couldn't get used to being back. Maybe because Junko and Tomoko were away. Whiskey on the rocks. Without any water? Same thing last night too. Mama, do you still feel worn out? A little. Everyone's dressed so nicely. All under 10,000 yen. You're kidding! That cheap? It's true. Miss Kiyomi sold them to the girls before Christmas. She bought the clothes Miss Yuri had pawned, then sold them to the girls here. She must have made 300,000. Very smart. Smarter if she'd saved it. She spent it all on that guy who sells black-market whiskey. Mr. Komatsu's in Akasaka right now. I'm here as a customer tonight. White Horse. A double. - It's been a long time. - It has. That's no tone to use with a customer. I quit the black market. Next time it would have been jail. Don't be so stuck up. I know you're Ionely. I've been thinking about it: Give me a chance just once. You won't regret it. I'm a paying customer! Oh, hello. - Leaving? - I was, but come up. No, I'll drive you home. You will? All right. I'm glad to see you're better. Thank you for calling on me. You drive well. I'm just a safe driver. I don't drink. Bars can't be much fun then. I'm looking for a mistress. Always joking. I wouldn't date a woman if I weren't considering marrying her. Thanks. What? Would you laugh if I proposed to you? I know. No need to answer. I just wanted to say it once. Pretend I never said it. Bye. Oh, it's you. What is it? I waited here. Better than going to your bar. May I come in? - Don't be so formal. You must be tired. What do you want? Out with it. The lawyer got me a suspended sentence. It's all thanks to you. You needn't have come. I already knew that. So what is it you want now? Money again? It's not for me. - Yoshio? - Yes. Dr. Murata said if he operates now, Yoshio will be walking before school starts. Without crutches? Well, that'll take six months of physical therapy. But he can't go to school as he is. I know you'll say no. It's a lot of money. Then why come? I'm sorry. I've always been a coward. I don't know why. How much will it cost? Never mind. It's selfish of me. I just thought maybe you could ask the owner - How much? At least 70 or 80,000. It can be in installments. Please help us. I won't ask again. That's what you always say. I mean it. I've made up my mind. We'll cut our ties as brother and sister. I promise... I'll never come here again. This is the last time. Please help. For poor Yoshio's sake. Please, I beg you! That's right - take everything! All of you! Just prey on me! Enough! I don't want to hear it! Come in. May I? Go home. Think it over. You sure it's all right? I meant to give you something earlier, but I forgot. Here. Open it after I leave. Please don't go. Stay awhile. What's wrong? Nothing. May I open it? Black Narcissus. You mentioned you liked it. Mama. Why are you crying? What's wrong, Mama? I'll take this one. Buying a present for someone? I heard you received a fine proposal. I saw the fortune-teller yesterday. She told me. She's good, isn't she? Well? Very becoming. Look. I don't have the money today, but I'll pay your hospital bill soon. Thank you. That's a huge help. Don't talk like that. We're not strangers anymore. You're right. I never dreamed I'd become the wife of a factory owner. Hello! You seem different today. Do I? Junko's waiting in back to talk to you. What about? She's quitting. At least she's giving notice. Don't be angry. So you're quitting? Why? I got Mr. Goda to put up some money. I'm opening a bar. Mr. Goda? Is that so? Congratulations. That's wonderful. What a relief! Did you find a place? It's above a sushi restaurant. We share the restroom, but I don't mind. What is it? Nothing at all. Congratulations. Hello? This is she. Mr. Sekine? No, he's not here. Who's calling? Mrs. Sekine? You're really his wife? Yes. Hello? Hello? It's so embarrassing. He may not look it, but my husband's a hopeless womanizer. He lures them in with marriage proposals. I can't count how often I've had to straighten things out. This time he borrowed the neighbor's car and hasn't been home in a week. I'm not even jealous anymore, but our neighbor is angry. He forgot his address book, so I called all the women in it. He's not bad at heart. He just loves to show off. He lies and then begins to think it's all true. That's just how he is. I'm so sorry I had to call you like that. A pretty woman like you - you didn't fall for it, did you? Fill it up. Mama, are you all right? I'm fine! Welcome. Welcome. You look well. I heard you were sick. I'm very well. See, it's really you that I love. Oh, my. Excuse me. Mr. Fujisaki, who's she? Introduce us. You're drunk. Mama, come here a moment. Komatsu, keep an eye on her. Leave me alone! Let me go! What do you plan to do? Drink till I die. Who's that geisha anyway? Acting so prim! I'll steal him back! Stop it! I hate you! - How's Mama? - Mr. Fujisaki's taking her to a nightclub. The geisha left. She can't keep drinking. Her guest wants her to go. I can't stop her. Mr. Fujisaki... I'll go anywhere with you tonight. Or don't you want a woman like me? I understand. But no more drinks. Mr. Fujisaki... I've heard you've had a lot of women. But I love you. Women fall for your type. You know that? Yes, I know. Let's go home. It's after 11:00. You mustn't get sick again. Let's go. I'm so glad you're here. The tax collector is coming tomorrow. Bring your books over tonight. We'll fix them up. I see. Whiskey really knocks you off your feet. I'm sorry to bother you. Do you feel ill? - No, but I'm thirsty. - Want some water? Thanks. Stop thanking me. I drank so much. Did I say anything? No, nothing. Thanks for everything. Good night. No, don't. I love you! I always have! No, don't! What's wrong? I had a dream. I was crying. When I woke up, I was really crying. What was your dream? It was about my late husband. Even when a woman's in your arms, you can never tell who she's really thinking of. Light me one, please. It was a strange dream. He called to say he was returning from a business trip. I went to the harbor to greet him. Strange that he'd be coming by ship, but that's how dreams are. He stood on deck, waving the presents he'd bought me. Guess what they were. Potatoes, onions, and radishes. We married just after the war, when food was scarce. He often brought vegetables back from his trips. Seeing those vegetables in the dream made me sad, so I started crying. I see. Was he a kind man? I love you... but I'd prefer a husband. Someone always by my side. I don't want to see you just once in a while. I'm happy now though. Really? You don't regret it? No, I don't. But I'm worried about one thing. Worried? When my husband died, I placed my picture and a letter in with his ashes. I vowed I'd never love another man. I wrote that down and asked the priest to put it in with him. I'm a strange woman, aren't I? I have to go now. No, stay a little longer. I can't. It's still early. I'll make some coffee. That's all right. I meant to tell you last night, but I couldn't. I'm being transferred to Osaka. When was that decided? The end of the year. I leave tomorrow. I won't forget you. Call me if you ever come to Osaka. All I can do now is help when you open your own place. I promise you that. Mr. Fujisaki... I really do love you. I love you too. You do? I love you... but I don't have the courage to break up my home. It may be selfish of me, but it's the truth. I bought this stock cheap. It's worth 100,000 now. Maybe it will help. I meant to leave it last night and go. A noble sentiment, but I was too low to see it through. I'll never forget this brief time together. Take care of yourself. I just saw Fujisaki. Why are you crying? Did he jilt you? I used to respect you. I was amazed at how you never gave in for five long years. That illusion's gone. Sorry. I'm not that good. Do you love him? Why don't you answer? I don't love him or hate him. Besides, he's being transferred to Osaka. You fool! Why'd you give in if you don't love him? Aren't you ashamed? Did you forget your letter and picture? - That was just - - Liar! I looked into it. I got drunk one day and asked the priest about it. Why'd you do that? Why? Don't pretend you don't know. You know I love you. But I never said a word. I kept it locked up inside. It became so unbearable I even seduced one of our girls. Some manager! Last December it got so I couldn't take it anymore. I went to the temple and checked. It turned out to be true, so I vowed never to touch you, or let anyone else either! But now you've turned into a consummate pro! Sorry to disappoint you. But who told me to act like a pro? Who told me to flatter Minobe? You told me never to go halfway, to be a real pro! Well, now I'm a pro, and the customer's happy. What's wrong with that? No! I love you! Let me go! Marry me. I'm begging you. Let's open our own bar. Get out or I'll scream. You hate me that much? I don't hate you or love you. That kind of marriage would never work. We know each other too well. Please just go. Go! Please let me be alone. You really love Fujisaki, don't you? I understand. I'll never bother you again. You'd be a great help, but I could never afford your salary. I see. Why'd you quit the Carton? Have a fight with Mama? I'm tired of that place. I may go back to the Club 8. I'll help out when you're busy. - Thanks. Good-bye. Mrs. Fujisaki? I'm Keiko from the Carton Bar, and a customer of the bank. You've been very kind to my husband. Not at all. Congratulations on his promotion. Thank you. I borrowed this from your husband. I'd like to return it. Is that all right? If I need it again, I'll borrow it directly from you. I see. Here's a little something for the children. Dear... Thanks. Please take good care of yourselves. She's beautiful. Not at all like a bar hostess. Mommy, what is this? Can we open it? Later. It had been a bleak ordeal, like a harsh winter. But the trees that line the streets can sprout new buds no matter how cold the wind. I too must be just as strong as the winds that gust around me. Ah! Welcome! It's been so long! Welcome! THE END
