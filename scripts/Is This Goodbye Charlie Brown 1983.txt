One more step, beagle... ...and I'll punch your lights out. Hey! [LINUS SCREAMING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Who is this? Oh, it's you, my sweet baboo. I am not your sweet baboo. Can I please speak to...? Did you call to ask me to go to a movie with you? Ugh! No, I did not. - I called to speak to... - But you can. That's the way it's done. When a boy wants to take a girI to the movies... ...he calls her up and he asks her: "Would you like to go to the movies with me?" And she says, "Yes, I would love to go to the movies with you. " And then they go to the movies together. But I didn't call you. I want to talk to your brother. Well, I'll be glad to go to the movies with you. I'll be ready here at noon, thank you. Here, my sweet baboo wants to talk to you. I am not your sweet baboo. Boy, oh, boy, my first date. Hello? I have something very important to tell you, Charlie Brown. Could I see you in a little while? Sure, Linus, come right over. What's the problem, Linus? We're moving away, Charlie Brown. You're what? My dad has been transferred and we're moving away. You should have told me on the phone. I can take bad news better on the phone. Every time the phone rings, I expect it to be bad news... ...and I'm ready for it. Well, anyway, we're moving away. We'll have to go to a new schooI and everything. We have a kid in our class who's been to eight schools. He never knows what's going on. But who am I to talk? I've only been to one schooI, and I still don't know what's going on. [PLAYING PIANO] What's this? So you won't forget me. Forget you? My dad has been transferred. Our family has to move to another town. Who is this? That's me. You can keep it on your piano so you won't forget me. What if I wanna forget you and I turn the picture around? What are you doing? I'm going to the movies. My sweet baboo is coming by at noon... ...and we're going to the movies. Don't count on it. [SIGHS] Well, I don't have much time. You're the last customer I'll ever have at this stand. I thought we might talk about this move of your family's. I don't know what I'll do without Linus. He's my very best friend. Not to mention the fact that he's my second baseman. I notice you don't mention missing me, Charlie Brown. I'm leaving too, you know. Well, I didn't mean that, uh, I wouldn't also... I mean, of course, I will... Well... As a matter of fact, I can't help you. I've sold my practice... ...and you'll have to discuss this with the new doctor. So long, Charlie Brown. The new doctor will soon be here. Good morning, doctor. Fifty cents? Are you crazy? I'm not gonna pay 50 cents. It's my whole week's allowance. Besides, I'm still hoping that they're not gonna move away. I'll just wait here for my regular doctor. It's you. I'm waiting for my sweet baboo. He's coming to take me to a movie. I'm afraid you're gonna have a long wait. He'll be here. He called me. Now, try to stay calm. I have terrible news. My dad's been transferred. We're moving to a new city. I don't believe it. I refuse to believe it. So there. This may be my last game, Charlie Brown. I'll probably never see you again. Unless, of course, we happen to go to the same college. What college do you think you'll be going to, Charlie Brown? It's kind of hard to decide in the last half of the ninth inning. Here, Charlie Brown. It's an invitation. We've received an invitation. Linus and Lucy are having a little farewell lunch. I guess it will be quite a nice party. It's being catered. Lunch? What about my date? What about the movie? My sweet baboo is supposed to pick me up at noon. I told you, we're invited to Linus' house for lunch. Come on, let's go. I'm not going. I'm going to sit here and wait for my date. Well, have it your way. Are you sure you got the right caterer? Not to worry. Joe CooI Catering came highly recommended. By who, I wonder? - Hi, Lucy. BO Y: How you been? [RINGING] All right, everybody, sit down, sit down. Lunch will now be served. Attention, everybody, attention. Hear, hear. As you know, we are moving to a new city... ...and this is our way of thanking you all and saying goodbye. BO Y 1: Hooray! BO Y 2: Goodbye. BO Y 1: Goodbye. Goodbye. Mr. Caterer, serve the dinner. [CHEERING] I propose a farewell toast to Lucy and Linus. Good luck and happiness in your new home. [CHEERING AND CHATTERING] Hey, I'm not sure, but are these dog biscuits? What kind of a lunch is this? It must be a fancy continentaI lunch, sir. I see there's a gravy boat. It seems to be water, sir. [GRO ANING] They should have had bowls. Ew! Dog food. Dog food. Well, I sure hate to say goodbye, Charlie Brown. It's sure been nice knowing you. This is really happening. I can't believe it. Well, so long, you old blockhead. It's been nice knowing you. I don't know what to say. I can't believe it. I... I... Snoopy always wanted this blanket. I think maybe I'II leave it with him. Linus is gone. If you're still waiting for your sweet baboo... ...you'd better forget all about it. I just saw him leave. What do you mean, "leave"? He's gone. He and Lucy have moved away. Their whole family just plain moved away. That's ridiculous. He can't move away. We had a date. Things like this just don't happen. I had a firm date. We had an understanding. I'll sue. Where was that big truck going? That's a moving van. Linus and Lucy have moved away. But I thought she was just kidding. I didn't think they'd really go. Well, what do you care? You never liked Lucy anyway. You were always picking on her. But I don't understand. I mean, I... Oh, stop making excuses. Go on home and play your old Beethoven. [PLAYING PIANO] Schroeder, what if you and I got married someday, and...? I never even said goodbye. Look, a postcard from Linus. "Dear Charlie Brown... ...this is the moteI we stayed in the first night. It had a swimming pooI, but we didn't go swimming. Lucy has been crabby all day. I have to ride in the back seat with her. This looks like it's going to be a long trip. Your friend, Linus. P.S., tell Snoopy to enjoy my blanket. " That's the saddest postcard I ever read. Don't tell me I've grown accustomed to that face. I understand you heard from Linus. Yes, he sent me a postcard from some moteI. It was the saddest postcard I've ever read. You miss him, huh? Yep, it's just not the same without Linus. I was gonna challenge your team to a game... ...but I guess it would be too crueI. Beating you ordinarily is pretty easy, Chuck... ...but with Lucy and Linus gone... ...it would be a massacre, Chuck. Now, look here. Don't say another word, Chuck. I know you're embarrassed for your team, but it's okay. I won't challenge you. I'll stick to playing in my league. At least they put up a struggle sometimes. Oh, boy. Hey, Marcie, we gotta do something about poor old Chuck. We gotta get his mind on other things. You're kind of sweet on Charles, aren't you, sir? Marcie, are you crazy? Sweet on Chuck indeed. How I can be sweet on a guy... ...who I can strike out with three pitches? Marcie, you're crazy. Maybe I ought to call Chuck. "Sweet on Chuck. " That's the craziest thing I ever heard. I guess the only civiI thing to do is to call the kid and leveI with him. How could anybody be sweet on Chuck? I hate to think of him, though... ...Iying there wide-awake and wondering. The poor kid. Maybe I should give him a break. Good grief. How could anybody fall for Chuck? The dumbest manager who ever lived. He can't pitch or bat or run or anything. Poor kid. [PHONE RINGING] - Hello? PATTY: Hi, Chuck. This is Peppermint Patty. How are you, Chuck? I'm all right, I guess. But I just... That's what I wanted to talk to you about, Chuck. I know you haven't been sleeping well... ...and I wanted to straighten out a few things. - Oh? - We gotta get this straight, Chuck... ...so if you wanna come and see me, well, I guess it'll be okay. Wha...? See you? Wha...? Yes, I realized you're all overcome, Chuck, so I'll help you. Yep, if you wanna take me out... ...oh, say, to the movies or something, why, it'll be okay, Chuck. [MUMBLES] Of course, if you try to hold my hand, Chuck... ...I'll have to slug you. Okay, kid, thanks for the invitation and the call. Now go to sleep. No more sleepless nights, hey, Chuck? Well, I'm glad the kid got it off his chest. It's kind of funny. I never knew old wishy-washy Chuck had fallen for me. Boy, a deed well done. [SNORING] Wha...? What am I doing here? Hello, hello? Boy, I must be cracking up. What am I doing here... ...in the middle of the night? I dreamt that I spoke to Peppermint Patty. I must be going bonkers. Now I'm wide-awake. It's time to get up. Good grief, it's 1:30 in the morning. What am I doing up at this unearthly hour? Maybe I'm dead. I wonder if I'll ever fall asleep again. Maybe this is it, never to sleep. [SNORING] Good morning, sir. You're up early. Yes, Marcie, I'm up. I don't know quite how to put it, Marcie, but I'm waiting for a date. I was invited last night, Marcie. You'll never guess with whom I had a heart-to-heart talk. You didn't call and bother Charles, did you, sir? What do you mean, Marcie, bother Chuck? Last night, Chuck offered to take me to a movie or something. And I'm waiting for him. Of course, I'm just being polite. No mushy stuff for me, Marcie. If Chuck gets too fresh, I'll deck him. I'm sure Charles would never do that, sir. Well, Marcie, I don't wanna be rude... ...but two's company and three's a crowd. Get what I mean? I hope you don't have to wait too long. So long, sir. Not to worry, Marcie. Good morning, Charles. Good morning, Marcie. Any news from Linus or Lucy? As a matter of fact, yes. Here's the second card I've received since they left. You read it. I'm too sleepy. "Dear Charlie Brown... ...the farther we go, the more crabby Lucy gets. I don't know how much longer I could take her crabbiness. Dad says that he's sorry already that he made the move. And he jokes about sending Lucy back home. I wish he would send me back. Ask Sally if she has seen any good movies lately. " You miss them, don't you, Charles? Yes, I do. You're not getting much sleep, are you, Charles? As a matter of fact, untiI last night, I was sleeping pretty well. Want to tell me about it, Charles? Well, last night, I felt sure I was cracking up. I awakened standing up, holding the phone to my ear, in the middle of the night. Then, when I went back to bed... ...I was wide-awake, and it took me forever to fall asleep. Did you talk to Peppermint Patty, by any chance? Strange you would say that. I did dream I had spoken to Patty on the phone... ...but as I told you, I fear for my sanity. Don't, Charles. Still waiting, sir? I hate to disappoint you, sir, but I saw Charles, and he's not coming. Marcie, you don't know about these things. He'll be here. Charles doesn't even know you called last night. He was asleep. The kid's fallen for me. He said he'd come for me today. You wouldn't understand. I'm trying to tell you, sir. He's not coming. Look, Marcie, you just tootle along. I'll sit here and wait for my date. If that's the way you want it, sir. Don't stay up all night. Well, here's your food. Come and get it. Okay, here it is. Enjoy it. And, remember, it's not good to eat your dinner quickly. I wish you'd learn to take more time. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Yes, this is he. Chuck, somebody waited and waited all day. Chuck, somebody was stood up. What do you have to say to that? - Huh? - Yes, you didn't show up... ...and now some people's feelings are hurt. You've done it, Chuck. Now you're going to have to stew in your own sorrow. Revenge is not for me, Chuck. Revenge is left for others, if you get what I mean. What? Who? Huh? You'll see now that I can still be a friend. In spite of your treachery, I'll turn the other cheek. I know you're bashfuI. And most likely, you were just too shy to show up. I understand. Well, Chuck, you'll have to do it on your own. Now it's up to you. I understand your reluctance to declare yourself... ...poor old wishy-washy Chuck. I never know what's going on. Get off the phone, big brother. I'm expecting a call. From whom are you expecting a call? My sweet baboo. You know that's not so. Linus is far, far away. And anyway, he wouldn't be calling you. Incidentally, here's his latest postcard. Read it. He mentions you. Oh, goody, goody, goody. Have I seen any good movies lately? I'll sue, that's what I'll do. [SIGHS] [TRUCK APPRO ACHES] Ah! Hey. You're back. My dad changed his mind. He didn't like the new job. What kind of a neighborhood is this, anyway? It didn't change a bit while we were gone. Don't people ever progress around here? What a stupid neighborhood. Oh, yeah, she's back too. [PLAYING PIANO] Your sweetie is back. Hey.
