What do you see? Your eyes are set wide apart. You have siblings luck. I'm an only child. That's why you're greedy. You're born with their luck, so you're lonely. I'm not lonely. The man you're dating will be your ruin. Break up! Dump him at once, sister! I don't have a boyfriend. I told you I can't work mornings! Bad brother! Why? why? why? Spit it out! It's dirty! Drink this! Dad! Money! Why you! I told you not to barge in when we're working! You're Bong-sun! What the hell'? - Do you know her? - Yes! Of course! Shin Bong-sun. SHIN BONG-SUN Who are you! Scripture says... 'After desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin'. 'Sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death'. Amen! Righteous Heavenly Father... Why did you come? Yesung? Yesus? Jesus?

Chief! I mean, Warden. You all haven't changed. - Sit down, please. - Have a seat, please. The Judicial Research and Training institute's... mock trial will now begin. The prosecution may proceed. Defendant Lee Yong-go abducted young Choi Ji-young... sexually abused her, and killed her with a brick. Everything has been proven by proper officials. I believe this case is not fit for a retrial whatsoever. Thank you. The defense may proceed. The prosecution's claim of proven evidence... that is the biggest error to this case. Your Honor, the defense speaks in contempt... Error'? Yes, Your Honor. The prosecution is not the one who was assigned to this case. Contrary to other cases... the evidence and records must all be re-investigated. But the prosecution seeks a ruling by taking fabricated records and false testimonies only. Then, were you the one in charge of defense back then? Were you? No, I was not. No further questions. But! I was there. That is a clear fact. You were there? Yes. I was there. Your Honor. Everything I'm about to say is nothing but the truth.

Last trial for a verdict hearing. Do good on your last chance. Do a good job. It's no time to be running! Yong-go! Crazy fool! She just fell? And died just like that? Yes. That's really weird. How was she lying on the ground? Just fallen down. It was scary. What if someone else killed her to steal the Sailor Moon bag'? Cut the crap, fool! So, when you went there she was just lying? Yes. - For no reason? - Yes. Think it could kill you? My arm! It hurts! Right! Arms! People usually fall arm first. Right! But her back of the head cracked. How'd that happen? The Sailor Moon bag! Right! The Sailor Moon bag. She was skipping like this? Right! It's the bag! What was the date on that day? February 27th,1:15 p.m. During lunch break. Okay! February 27th... That day was our bath day! What the! There's no water. Turn the water on! The pipes froze over so we couldn't take showers! - Right! It was -18 C! - Yeah! She slipped on ice! That's it, boss! There's water everywhere in the markets. That's right! Then, what about the wound on the kid's forehead? There was a brick next to her? Yes. There was a brick. A brick? - Wait... - A brick? While She fell... I'm dying here! But Why'd you pull her pants off? First, loosen the pants to help blood circulation. - Blood circulation? - Yes. Then, Why'd you strangle her? I didn't. Second... Press the chest vertically. Next... Free the airway and block the nose. Breathe in 12 times a minute. - Good job. - Yes. Next? Wake up! Wake up! Are you okay? - Wake up! - Good. Shake the patient to gain consciousness. Next? Pinch or slap. - Don't hit for real, sir! - He's alive. - Damn it! - Right. He's alive. Now, let's follow along. Cardie Pulmonary Resuscitation. - Cardie Pulmonary Resuscitation. - That's right. - CPR. Right. - Of course! It was the Commissioner General's kid. And it's no fun drawing blame on the market. Pressure to solve the case all around them! Yong-go got talked into taking the blame! Shit! We'll do Yong-gu's trial! I object! The witnesses claim only circumstantial evidence. The witnesses testified to only what is true. Really? - Mr. So? - Yes? What did you do in life? Hallelujah. I'm a pastor. I mean your past. What? I'm not sure when you are referring to. I also made clubs with friends to play soccer. Weren't you a gangster? - What? - Your Honor! - His past is irrelevant to... - And you? Mr. Choi? I've always been interested in sunken treasure ships. - Charged on 7 accounts of fraud? - I object! Bringing up the witnesses' past is irrelevant to this case. Overruled. Can we trust testimonies from men who served sentences? Look, Brother... I mean, Prosecutor? Is there a law... that states testimonies from former inmates can't be trusted? - No, but... - So, tell me! Is there a law that says folks like us always lie! No, there isn't. - No further examination. - You mean questions! We're not suspects here! Order! I apologize. Defense? Do you have another witness? As the prosecution requests, he has no criminal record. Rather, he has worked hard for the country. I call the prison Chief at the time to the stand. - Let's go. - Sure. I am Jang Min-hwan Chief of Security at Prison. - One of our inmates... - How is he? Eating three meals a clay. Exercising when it's time. When it's past 9:00 p.m... he'll probably sleep. Commissioner? I know it's not my place, but please re-investigate the case. Then, he'll walk free after his term. Am I wrong? Lee Yong-go... He's innocent, sir. A child... Ever lost one? Yes, I have. To an inmate I cherished. Defendant? Did you abduct the Commissioner's daughter to get revenge? Yes. I followed her. Sailor Moon bag store. Daddy! Just read what the uncles wrote. Read it! Ji-young said she'd show me a store that sells Sailor Moon bags. So, I just followed her. - That's it. - Good! Did you pull her pants off to sexually abuse her? Did you? First, loosen pants for blood circulation. Good! Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation. I don't remember. Did you hit Choi Ji-young with a brick to kill her? No. Ji-young fell and... - Yong-gu! - Oh my! When you can't remember, what do you say? I... don't remember. That's good. - I don't remember. - Good. Remember... - Happy! Happy! - Happy, Happy Happy Mart. That's good! A brick fell on her head. - Did you see it'? - No, I didn't. Come on, pal! - Just pretend you know! - That's right! Cardie Pulmonary Resuscitation... Yong-go! Yes? Do it in the morning. Yes. Your Honor... lam intellectually impaired. The scary policemen hit me. They didn't investigate. PETITION Read this over. - What is it? - Here. I wrote it myself! Pass the pens! Don't spill on it. Write clearly. Sign it. They said if I signed, they'll send me home to Yesung. And buy me the Sailor Moon bag. And so... the written statement... is all fabricated. Perfect! You win! Daddy! Great job! - Yong-gu! - Yes? Your lawyer is here to see you. Yes? Is this a prison or daycare! Anything you'd like to eat'? I can get it for you. Free Time! The chocolate bar? Yes, tasty Free Time. You have a daughter. Yesung? Yes. Yesung is pretty. - Listen to me carefully. - Yes. The girl's father is the police commissioner. Yes. Damn... You know! The police! Yes, police. Very scary. He's the leader of the scary men! He's totally out of it! He could harm Yesung! Yes. How frustrating. Mr. Lawyer? Mr. Lawyer? Here are our inmates' petitions. These things don't really help. Even a public lawyer should show dedication! It still won't lessen his sentence. Look! Look at this! Lee Yong-go is not smart enough to write this! Still think he's the culprit! Think of Yesung... and stay focused. Yes. I must go home. Right. You can go home. Don't worry. Got that? Yes. Ji-young said she knew a store that sold the Sailor Moon bag. So, I followed her. But Ji-young suddenly fell. Speak clearly to the judge. Speak clearly. He wanted revenge on the Commissioner for getting hit. So, you abducted his daughter Ji-young, correct? I repeat. Did you abduct Choi Ji-young? You must die for Yesung to live. You get it? You're the father. When Ji-young resisted sexual assault... you killed her with a brick, correct? I repeat the question. Did you strike Choi Ji-young with a brick? Defendant! Answer the question. Accept your punishment. If not, I'll do the same to your daughter. Answer the question. Yes. When Ji-young resisted sexual assault... you killed her with a brick, correct? I repeat the question. Did you strike Choi Ji-young with a brick? Did you kill her with a brick? - Defendant! - Yes. Did you kill her with a brick? Yes, I did. Bastard! Think your kid will be fine! I'll kill your kid, too! Ji-young! I'll kill your kid, too! Yes. I did it. I did it. Lee Yong-go! What are you saying! Come to your senses! Your Honor, the defendant is psychologically intimidated. Order! You're his lawyer! Do something! I killed her. I did. Are you out of your mind! You didn't kill anyone! She died because of me. I'm sorry. Very sorry. Why're you sorry! No one apologized to you! Why are you so sorry! If you speak out, you'll be ordered to leave. Please help my Yesung. My daughter. - Order! - I did it. What are you doing! You're a lawyer! A lawyer can't be like this! The police only took the witness accounts... and dismissed the defendant's denials. Lee's statement was fabricated by force from the police. Also! Ji-young did not die of the brick wound... but an occipital injury! That too was dismissed! Contrary to police claims that Lee strangled her... her autopsy showed no sign of strangling whatsoever! Defense? Give your final argument. Your Honor. I request for leniency. The prosecution's demand? The defendant admitted to the charges. I request the same sentence to the defendant as the first trial. Your Honor! The investigation is biased. It was only forcibly done to establish a crime. They dismissed the principle of presumed innocence! They abused the defendant's mental disability... and love for his daughter to force him to give up on everything! The innocent defendant was sacrificed at their convenience! As the defendant admitted to the charges, the trial is adjourned. The defendant's appeal is rejected. The first trial's sentence stands. Defendant Lee Yong-go is sentenced to death. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I was wrong. Please help Yesung. It's my fault. And so, I defend... a man wrongfully sentenced to death... to clear defendant Lee Yong-gu's false accusations. That is why... I am here today. His wife said, I can take piano lessons. Piano? The Chief has a piano at home. Daddy, I'll play it for you later. Piano? I like piano. Daddy? You're not a bad man, right? - Yong-go? - Yes. Take care. One, two, three! See? Isn't cooking fun? It'd be easier to eat out. Yesung makes this a special Thanksgiving. Yesung made this pretty one. You too, Mister. It's from Yesung! Hi, Daddy. How are you? - Is it from Yesung? - Letter from Yesung! Let me see! Tada! 100! Yesung got perfect! Good job! Bong-sun should be a model when she grows up. Funny. Baby looks funny. - He's way too honest. - I'm sorry. Fall on your knees Hear the angel voices Night divine Hello... Uncle... Uncle 1004, hello! Are you studying hard? I'm dying to hear you read to me soon. I hope you get along well with Daddy and the others. Take care. From Yesung! It's been hours! Hello... Shouldn't we prepare something for the annual talent show? That's a load of bullshit. If we place first, will they let us out? Yeah! One night out with family. Really? - Disgusting! - Yesung! How about singing? - Yes, singing! Sailor Moon! - Good idea! - She will never turn her back... - Cut that out! Sir? There are more Christmas amnesties this year. Due to presidential elections? Right, the elections. Lots to send off, too. Pardon? The date's been set for 5482. December 23rd. - Spider. - Louder. - Spider. - Louder! Spider! - What about this? - This? Philippines. Morphine? No, it says 'Hairpin'! You read that already! So weak in the head! Stop it! YESUNG I can't decide that on my own. I'll need permission from the principal. This is the last time. Pardon? That Yesung can see her father. Please help. I'm begging you. Pretty. Shit! Why's the execution so soon after the trial? This should be protested. It goes completely against existing laws! I should be the one to go first. Everyone in the prison deserves to go before him. Pretty. Yong-go... We can't let him go like this. - Hey, Chun-ho! - Yes? Oh no! What's going on! I'm sorry. Why'd this break? Take them quick! Ouch! It's saving a man's life. Only if you give me your turf. One! The hell! Two! Gotcha! You're working? Carry on, then. You heard? If you think this is your father, please come up. Do it right. It's to save a life. Got it? Yes, boss! Here! Here! Where are the boys? It's taking long to blow up the big thing. You sure he's your father? You said, you're an orphan. All the fathers in the world is my father! Go Cell 7! Go! Holy night The stars are brightly shining It is the night of the dear Savior's birth Long lay the world In sin and error pining Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn Fall on your knees Hear the angel voice Night divine Night when Christ was born Night divine Everything's all set? Don't worry. Yesung's teacher's on our side. Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus praise we Let all within us praise His holy name Daddy? Hand. Hold hands. - Hurry Up! - Hold hands! Hold! Let's go!

For my angelic father. The defense gives the final argument. In the name of justice... I will... forgive... my father. Defendant Lee Yong-gu's disability is recognized. He was threatened and beaten by the police. The court accepts he was forced to confess. According to testimonies... there is not enough evidence... that he abducted, sexually abused, then killed Choi Ji-young. The court remands this case... and overturn Lee's death sentence... and demands a re-investigation. The court finds Lee Yong-go... not guilty! Yesung! - Yesung! - Hello! It's Daddy'. Yesung! Daddy's here! Daddy? - Goodbye, Yesung! - Goodbye! Goodbye, Daddy. - Goodbye! - Yesung, goodbye! I love you! - Yesung, I love you! - Goodbye! Eat your beans!
