The sky was full of stars. Now go and get washed. Otherwise the sun will be laughing at you. Yes, yes. Heidi! I just wanted to say ... You wanted to say 'good morning'? No, I wanted to... Good morning, Alp-hi! - What do you want? - Do you have to stay at home now? - Do I? Who says so? - The pastor said it. - I'm ready! - Do you have cheese and bread? You're always thinking about food. Go now! And don't come home too late. Hey, Alp-hi! Nobody told you anything? What? That you were coming? I need to discuss something with you. No time. I have to work. I was preparing my sermon on the way. So? Is it about charity? No, about patience. - Luke 21, 19. - Why? Isn't it written: 'In your patience ye shall win your souls'? Yes, yes. May help you a bit? Surely that's not why you've come up here. Doesn't matter. So what do you want? You have beautiful grass. - Well, I'm here with a request. - With a request? The new bells will be raised Saturday after next. The children do it, as is the custom. Your grandchild is one of them. Will you bring her down? Heidi does not like to go down to the village. But in fall she will have to go to school anyway. She should have gone last year already. No more excuses this time. Who says so? The law. I was given the child two years ago. At that time, no one asked if I wanted the child. And now I decide what's to be done with her. You wouldn't start a fight with the board of education? They should leave my Heidi in peace, she likes to be with me. Here, take this. Shall we? It's far to go up there! You promised that we would go on the next sunny day. This is today. I want to see where the stream comes from. We'll get a huge hunger if we go up any further. - I have some food left. - But I have nothing left. You can have the cheese. And the piece of sausage? You'll get that too, but only once we reach the top. I'm sorry, you can't have the piece of sausage anymore. But are we really going? Word of honor? - If I say so. - Hush! Look. I know what you want of me, Father. Please sit down. You think these bells can just ring in the reconciliation? That's why you came to me and not because of Heidi. That's what I thought. Why not? When I moved into the village, the misfortune had already happened. But the others?! They claim that I did not quench the fire in that windy night. Out of arrogance and ruthlessness. The embers supposedly sparked out of my chimney. And I was to blame that 5 houses and the church tower burned down. - Do you want some cider? - Why not? And yet I can swear that I did not even have a fire going that night. If only I had let the other houses burn. But I was the first one trying to put the fire out. Me and my son. He was killed while trying to extinguish it. Six months later his wife, Heidi's mother, died out of grief. Do you think I can simply forget? And after all that, they pursued me in justice! I had enough of these neighbors. That's why I came up here. Believe it or not, but I am as innocent as Job. Without any misdeed. Innocent. And here you think that I'll go to church on Sundays? It would not bother me. Even if a biblical man like yourself has no need for it. - Think it over again... - There is nothing to think over! Just do it for the child! - Goodbye, Alp-hi. The cider was good. - Goodbye. Here, now we are on top. Give me my sausage. But we can go still further up. Higher up there's only rocks. You can see that. - And we can't climb up? - No. - Why not? - Because there's only rocks. - And where does the stream begin? - This is the source. - Then where's the beginning of the source? - Give it a rest! There, on the top of the ridge is also a small lake. - Have you ever seen it? - Sure! - So you can go up further! - Will you promise me... ...that I'll get some of the sausage? - But are we really going? - Yes, we're going! Here it is: The beginning of the source! Let's go to the lake. How beautiful it is up here. - Where does the water come from? - From the sky. But you won't make me go up there, I'm telling you right now. Where are we here? At Echo Ridge. Listen: Little swan, little bear! - Grandfather! - Heidi! Stupid pig-cat! You made the echo angry. Give me your hand. Let us sing something. But a beautiful song. The brook flows into the village. And where does the water flow then? Into the Rhine. And the Rhine? - Into Lake Constance. - And it stays there? - I don't know. - Who knows then? - The teacher. He knows it from books. - Can't you read them? - Not those. - Why not? You're so nosey! Come on, let's go. You have to know what you want: Either you learn how to read, or... ... you can go up to the mountain. You can't do both. Then I don't want to learn how to read. Never! I'm sure the pastor means well. But we two don't want to have anything to do with the villagers. Are the bells heavy? It depends on the size. Can the children even carry them? Yes, if they work together. And if a child is sick? Then another one takes its place. But if all are there already, there's nobody left who can stand in. Shouldn't we go down after all? We could wait around. We'll see. Thanks, Grandfather! Shall I sing something? Yes. - Hey mother, it's starting. - Alright, then go. I'm going to the village. Are you sure you don't want to step inside? When it's over, I'll knock at the door and wait here. Hello. Heidi! So you made it? I can help with the bell. But grandfather said someone must go with me. I see! Close the store already. We want to be there when our boys arrive. He could have come for the entire day! Let the people talk. The hens can't do it! That's right! What is right?! How dare you! Let him go. One should take away the child. He'll get what's coming to him yet. Nobody will help him then. All children to the rope. But lift the rope only once the bell founder says so. Lift the rope! What's wrong with that little one? You don't want to join in? It belongs to Alp-hi. Come, you're part of it as well. Come on, pull! There's enough for all. All will get a chance. - Did you also get a sausage? - Yes. - But Brigitte, this is white bread. - This is a soft roll. - Do you want some? - A little, but the rest is yours. My late husband used to bring me white bread every Saturday. Didn't it get hard? Later in the week I roasted it... ... on the fire. - If I had money, I'd buy you... - ... white bread daily. - I can live without it. - Are you coming to see us? - Welcome! Brigitte, your house looks run down. Grandfather! I got a sausage and was allowed to pull too. I know! - Do you live...? - Peter and I live here. - And in the chambers up there? - We can't, the roof is broken. Don't you know how to use a hammer and nails? Nobody will show him, how. I have to climb up every day with the goats. Someone else would have to do it. Why don't you take someone in the two chambers over winter. - I could do that. - I mean for a fee, of course. Of course. I think I know now what you mean. You do. That's good. Goodbye. Come, Heidi. Get home safely. Heidi, come on! We have a visitor. Your aunt from Frankfurt. - Yes? - Go see her at once. She has been waiting for 2 hours. She's upstairs. She also brought you something. Look at that! Heidi, how much you have grown! Give me your hand. I hope you remember me? - You're Aunt Dete. - So, you have not forgotten me then. I brought you a dress. Go ahead, unpack it! Yes. Thank you. But why would you deny her happiness? You only get such an opportunity once in a lifetime. The child stays here. But then my trip from Frankfurt would have been completely useless. For the last time: The child does not belong in the city. I see. And what gives you the right to decide that? I took her in, back then. And I was entrused with Heidi by my late sister. At that time you didn't have a bad conscience. But now, after two years... I had just obtained a position and could not take care of her. But now it is high time for a good education. In the house there's 2 bathrooms, a governess, and electricity. And you can eat for example chicken or venison even on weekdays. - I'm sure she'll get a good deal. - Stop this nonsense! Make a decision. It's urgent. Lord Sesemann is going to America in a few days. That's why he can't leave his daughter Klara alone. Just imagine, she always has to sit in her chair. You only ever think of yourself. That's why you're feuding with everybody. That's enough. Get out! Good. I'm leaving on my own. I won't be sent away. Adieu! She never received such a nice dress in her life. That's ok. She is also a good kid. I must go now. Unfortunately I can't stay here. Do you want to accompany me for a bit? - I don't know. - Of course, just go. That way we can at least spend a moment together. Come! - Adieu. - Have a good trip. Listen, Heidi. Are you sure you don't want to come with me? Where to? To the train station, by car. I need to ask Grandfather first. Nonsense. Just come with me. We could surprise him. You could buy him something. What? A tobacco pipe? Yes, that way for once you'll have a present for him. Oh yes! But then we have to hurry. Heidi?! Where are you going? To the train station with my aunt. When will Heidi come back? Right thereafter. From the train station? Who says they're going to the station? Heidi. Just now. For God's sake. Alp-hi! Alp-hi! Gee! Where is the child? (Man) What a child? Heidi. Imagine not stupid! Seek them out yet! You have Heidi kidnapped! Why are you raging so? The baker took her in the car. What? Heidi! You won't find a pipe down here. What do we do now? You can get pipes where I come from. In Frankfurt. Is it far? Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Why don't you go there with me? I know you'll love it. But will I be back home tonight? Why? Otherwise Grandfather will be worried. But Grandfather would be happy to let you see something new. But will I be back tomorrow? Come with me. And if you want to, you can be back very quickly. Just do everything as I told you. - And what's that...? - Psst! No time for questions. There you are. Good evening, Sebastian. Is that all? - This is my niece. - Then go in, you are expected. Johann, pick up Lord Sesemann only after 11 o'clock. Good night. Where is the child? (Man) What a child? Heidi. Imagine not stupid! Seek them out yet! You have Heidi kidnapped! Why are you raging so?

Good evening, Miss Klara. Good evening, Miss Rottenmeyer. I do apologize, the train was late. I am very grateful that the car could wait that long. Otherwise everything went fine. Now, give everyone your hand. - Hello. - So this is the child, Dete? Step closer, girl. What's your name? The Miss asked about your name. Tell her. Heidi. What kind of name is that? That can't be right. It's the name of her late mother, Adelheid. I dare say. How old are you? 8 years. 8 years? That's impossible. Is it true, Dete? It can't really be verified... ...come with me.

He was known for his Klugkeit . One day the Emperor rode with his crown over the heath , - - Stopped and said : ' If you give me answer three questions can , I will reward you richly . ' ' How can I get the number learn of the stars in the sky? ' Without thinking , replied the shepherd : ' Just Send out your servants , to count the grains of sand on the beach. ' " Countless numbers . " ' Now tell me : how long do I need to ride down to the earth? ' " What do you mean what the shepherds said ? I do not know. " ' If your rides so that the sun is always above your crown , - - You're in twice twelve hours here again. ' The last question has been no one answer : ' How long is eternity? ' The shepherd thought and replied : ' Somewhere there is a high mountain . ' " Higher than the Echo Ridge ? " Higher than all the mountains of the earth. ' Every 1000 years is of a bird and sharpens its beak on it. And when the whole mountain has worn to the ground , - - Then the first second eternity past . ' " How did you like the story?
