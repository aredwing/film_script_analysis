Don't be offended. We have a way of making sure our client are who they said they are. Fuck her. Now. And we watch. You are negotiating huh? Now. Victor Dragovic is in Jersey. Bullshit. Why? I don't know, that's all that I know okay? Look, Nick, you don't know who you're fucking with okay? These Serbs, they're not like the Italians. Fuck, they're not even like the Russians, alright? They have no code. Hmm. Ugh! No, no! Wait! Wait! Wait! Where is the delivery? Pull me up and I'll talk. - Ah! No! - Where? Wait. New Jersey docks. The ship is called The Cambodian Star. Now pull me up! - Will Dragovic be there? - Hmm? Yes, yes. Victor Dragovic will be there. Now pull me up. Pull me up. Please. Please. You can have her. No charge, I promise. I'll throw her sister in too, okay? Huh? Oh, please. I told you everything I know. Come on. Just pull me up. Ah! Negotiation is over. They say our genes are what make us immortal, that our children will carry on our names, our legacy. That it is family that gives us hope. I am proud of you Andre. As I am of your brothers, Ivan and Goran. Means Happy Birthday kid brother. My fourth son Janko could not be here but he sends best wishes from Poipet. My son, Andre, you and I have the same blood in our veins. Here is to many good adventures. May we all live long. Detective Cassidy. Special Agent Reed, Human Trafficking Task Force. What can I do for the FBI? Well, you know I'd hoped for a little more inter-agency collaboration. You're trying to keep the operation contained. - Stop so... - Leaks, yeah I understand. Look, you know, it's not too late to hand the op over to us, you know. Viktor Dragovic. Ex-Serbian national, now working in Russia. Thank you for coming in late. Dragovic made a fortune in hotels and gambling in Eastern Europe and Asia. But he's also a major player in what I consider the most despicable endeavor on Planet E, human trafficking. Dragovic kidnaps young girls in South East Asia, runs them through Europe then sells them all over the globe. The skin trade's worth billions of dollars. Last year alone this country saw over 2000 cases and I consider every single one of those a goddamned tragedy. This is Dragovic's oldest son, Goran. Educated in England. Son number two, Ivan. Runs the Middle East operation. This is son number three, Andre. Isn't he cute? He's a student at NYU. And there's a fourth son Janko who runs the trafficking operations in South East Asia. Okay you all know Nick Cassidy. He's the case officer in this particular opus. Take it away Nick. This morning we fished Dex Guroff, an informant, out of the Hudson. Two gunshot wounds to the head. Before he was killed Dex confirmed to me that Viktor Dragovic is here in Jersey. Now thanks to shared bi-lateral intelligence by the Royal Thai Police, we know why. Better. We know where. Our target is the ship The Cambodian Star. The coast guard confirms it arrives at Pier 21 at the Jersey Docks in less than three hours. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to make sure that coming to America was the worst decision Viktor Dragovic ever made. Andre, relax. This time, your first time, I will be with you. Open door. Go; Q9, go! go' Move! It's not my fault. Janko, your son. But you? You are the boat skipper. Where I come from, men are accountable for their actions. Today, Andre, you will prove that you are your father's son. The blood on my hands is the same as the blood on yours. Make me proud. Please. Please, no. Please! This is the police. If you have any weapons lie them down. Andre! Left side cover! Andre! Stay with him! You have to run, Andre. He cannot chase us both. - I want to fight with you. - Obey me Andre! Run. Survive. I'll prove to you... I am my father's son! No! I've waited my whole life for this moment. I am not afraid to die. Do it. Do it! - You okay? - Yeah. Holy Christ. Mr. Dragovic was unaware of the contents of the container. He maintains he never fired a shot. And that he and his son Andre were caught in your mishandled operation. My client is a respected businessman in Russia and in Asia. But not in Serbia, though. - Right, Colonel? - Hmm? Pretty dicey for you to go back there. All those bodies in that container, did they give you a little buzz on your old genocide days? Mr. Dragovic was exonerated by the International Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. He is a Russian citizen now. The Russian government have been contacted and you... - Excuse me, Captain. - Yeah? Be right back. - Who's this, Reed? - Russian counsel. Mr. Romanov, this is Captain Costello. I spoke to the Russian embassy in Washington. I'm here to monitor my client's human rights. Really? His human rights? Are you fucking kidding me? You're lucky I don't poke your fucking eyes out. Let me know when he's gone, Reed. I'm going to wrap every dead body from that container around your neck. 30 counts of murder. You should have killed me in that dockyard, Detective. How the hell can you sleep at night? How can you do this? Buy and sell human lives. Ask my customers. When they stop buying, I stop selling. Goran. Ivan. The skipper you recommended? He fucked up. The police know about the delivery. Janko. Our baby brother is dead. Father in prison! All our contacts in the government over there will have to come over soon. Russia won't take us anymore. And don't you fuck this one up. - I... - You're family, okay? You're blood. Even if it is diluted whore's blood. And Andre's killer? Don't you fucking worry about that. Come on in. Janko here, he has picked you to be in one of his movies. Now can you say, 'fuck my ass' in that lovely accent of yours? Wow. Get up! Tony, the Americans, they have Viktor. We know. The sons, they try to get him out. They have contact in government. They want revenge too against the cop that killed the youngest, Andre. Min. You should stop this work. It's dangerous. When I call the police and give information they said they would protect me. We have. Every time. So as long as you are on the case, I do what I do. Maybe it stop what happened to me happening to other girls. Let's see what you got. OK!- If by your art, my dearest father, you have put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek, dashes the fire out. Oh, I have suffered with those that I saw suffer. You do exactly that on Friday. You'll be there? Haven't I been there at all the important moments of your life? Hmm? No. You haven't. What? Are you two ganging up on me? Alright, you get some sleep. I'm going to have to deal with this, this uh... this criminal. What's wrong? Hmm? The girls in that crate were Sofia's age. At least she has you looking out for her. Today I stared into a man's eyes and knew nothing was looking back. How does that happen? What date is it today? Shit. I forgot. Thirteen years. Look I'll get you the most beautiful roses in New York tomorrow morning. I promise. You may forget, but I don't. Happy anniversary. What now? Are you even... It's Costello. I got to take it. Yeah? Hey Nick, it's Costello. Listen, this is important. I just got off the phone with the Thai police in Bangkok. Listen, Viktor Dragovic is... Rosa! Nick. This is for our brother. No! Dad? Sofia, get back. - Ah! Dad! Please don't. . ' Dad! Jesus, Nick. Nick, can you hear me? It's Costello and Reed. I know this is hard and we're probably the last two guys in the world you want to talk to right now. It's the wrong time and place. Let's get out of here. Nick? Nick? Rosa. Sofia. I'm sorry. Nick. Rosa and Sofia are dead. Their bodies were consumed by the blaze. The firefighters found you downstairs. Dragovic? He's gone. Diplomatic pressure convinced the judge to grant him bail. As soon as he was on the street he was in the air. There was nothing we could do. Russians wouldn't take him. We think he's somewhere in Thailand, maybe Cambodia. Nick, you don't need to think about this right now, man. All the guys sent you this card and I'm going to put it right here. There was a funeral. How much did Dragovic pay you counsel? I'm a diplomat. I have immunity! I have a wife! Children! So did I. Where's Viktor? ' - Where?! Poipet, Cambodia. Baby Doll. Ah! Vi ktor. You have to move on. There's nothing more I can do. What do you mean? Nothing more you can do. The Americans are insisting, and the Thai too. They are applying heavy political pressure. I can't keep denying that you are here forever. There's only so much I can do without them asking questions. There can be political consequences. The woman in the photo, she is not your wife. And the girl in the next one? She is about the same age as your daughter. 0K!- I'll try for two more weeks. But then you must leave for Laos. That works. Hey hey! No running I said! I want to put in place a plan for you, my sons. To take over the companies. You, Goran, will oversee all the operations in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus. Ivan, you will take over Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czech Republic. Both of you will oversee expanding trafficking, South East Asia. Janko? Oh, oh, oh! Not bad huh? I'm getting good! I like a girl who can fight. 21 cuts, 7 cigarette burns. How old were you when they took you from Vietnam to Germany? Twelve. You know, I remember my mother was really upset because she only got $700 and not $1000. Agent Reed is from the FBl's human trafficking task force. This is special branch major Tony Vitayakul, his partner, Captain Nung. This is cell phone footage shot by a guest at a New York restaurant owned by Viktor Dragovic's attorney. Cambodia, Baby Doll. Watch the background. He took a plane to Dallas. From there we tracked him to Mexico City where he could buy a fake American passport for under $1000. But he bought it from a snitch and you know how these things pan out. We think Nick is suffering from a severe psychological breakdown. Nick's plane landed exactly 18 minutes ago. I got lucky. Cassidy's gone crazy. He's gone insane. He's on the south ramp. He went that way. You stay with Nung. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Ah! Argh! Ah! Ah! Yes? Tony. He in Baby Doll now. We'll be there. Okay, quick. I wait for you. Be careful. Where's Janko? No Janko. No Janko. No Janko. No speak English. Ah! Where is he? Where is he? He's at the warehouse. The warehouse, by the river. Where he keeps his stock. Stock? Young girls. Ah! Get out. OK!- Fuck this, stupid motherfucker. The man you are looking for, he is in Janko's office. But Janko not here. Get down! Get down! Put your gun down! You killed Nung! I didn't kill that cop. I just want Viktor Dragovic and his sons. After that I don't care. That cop was my friend. Last chance. Get back! (gunsho? Tony. You get him? You okay? You hit? Come on. We're going to get this guy. Just go. You stay here. I'll go check the tapes. Ok. Gotcha. Have you found out who's leaking the information to the police? Good. We'll send someone for her now. OK!- Never underestimate a pervert. Where's Janko? Where is he? He's at the warehouse. By the river. Where he keeps his stock. H 9Y- Let's go. Go, go, go! Stay here. Where's Janko? (gunsho? Ah! You're not my brother. You're the son of a whore who fucked everything up. Father would never! Father says goodnight. Janko! Where's Viktor? Hey Janko! Ah! Get it over with. The man you killed had a wife and kid! Another one coming in a month! I told you I didn't kill him. Reed shot him with his own weapon and gave it to me. Down! Tell me where your father's going! Yah! Ah! Janko! Can you hear me? Where's your father gone? Where? Cheng... Cheng Chao. Cheng Chao. When did Dragovic get you? Guess we all have our price, Nick. Look at the price you paid. You should have got with the program. You think you two are going to stop the skin trade just because you run around like fucking boy scouts? Fuck you care about these girls? They'll just rot wherever they are anyway. And you will rot in hell. He mentioned an air strip. Cheng Chao. You know it? Cheng Chao. The Cambodia border. Hold still. Why are you doing this? You're hurt. No, this. Going to the border. Probably getting ourselves killed. - It's my job. - Bullshit. You're talking to a cop here. There's Min, my informant. She's my girlfriend. You know... some of these girls are just not kidnapped. They are sold. Sold by who? Their parents. Min was sold by her mother. Now I think they got her and they could do anything. Mm. I love people with scars. We are the same, you and I. Mm. You have a very strong heartbeat. There is a musicality to the rhythm. Dum, dum. Dum, dum. Dum, dum. Dum, dum. We are not the same. No? No one with a heart can do what you do. Blood money is still money. But nobody wants damaged goods. Vi ktor. Adieu. ' Ah! Tony! The kids! Listen, okay. You see those trees? I want you to run and hide behind them. I want you to look back. Remember the faces of these men. If something happens your father or me, it is your duty to do something about it when you get older. Remember. Now run! Dad. It is a helicopter. You can watch me kill her. Ah! - Go. - No, no, no. Mister we aren't finished. Go! Too bad you'll never see your daughter again. Sofia, right? She was a very fine piece of merchandise. Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? So she could still be alive? I hope so. We'll be coming back to collect her. Don't ever lose hope Nick. I don't know where she is. But whatever it takes, wherever I have to go, I'm going to find my daughter.
