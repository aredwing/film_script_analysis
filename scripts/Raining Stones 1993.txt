There's one here on its own. This one on its own. Go round the back of him. Go round the back of him slowly. We've not come all this way for fuck all. Go round the back of him slowly. Oops... Get it, lad! Get it. I've got the bastard! You've got it! Get it! She'll get it! Oh, we've got to get hold of it! I've got the bastard! Hold it! Hold it! I've got it! What do I do with it? Get hold of the scruff! Hold it tight! Get hold of it! Help me, will yer! Hold it! Come here! Take it easy, will you, lad, I've got no chance here... Ah! There's shit all over... look at this! Watch that, it's scalding hot, son... I am knackered... It just wants one good belt on the back of the head, then it'll be stone dead. Good hard... short, sharp shock. Come on, let's give it a go. Just wack it across the napper. Good heavy blow. But where, though? The back of the head, across the shoulders, know what I mean? Put plenty of force into it, son. Go on, go on, go on, go on! Just whack it. Hit it on the head. Look, look! There's one thing... What are you waiting for? Hit it. Listen, we could always sell it as it is. To that butcher, you're joking. He'd rob us blind. Give it a belt, will you, Bob. Oh, you know, you're so good at giving the orders out, you do it. Come on, when you kill it, I'll skin it. I'll peel that bleedin' fleece off like peeling an orange. Now just give it a belt. Come on son, you belt it. Get on this side. Get on this side. Oh, there's me fucking tea! Jesus... hold the bleedin' thing! Tommy, I fucking got it! I've got it. Cor blimey, its' got loads of bottle, ain't it. What do you get off of sheep, anyway? Foot and mouth disease unless you wear a condom. Ah, very clever, very droll. Yeah. I'm serious here, what do you get off it? Mutton, you dopey bleeder. What do you think you get off it? Yeah, but what do you mean? Show it me. Get four legs, don't you. Couple of shoulders, all them chops, feel the ribs there, all of them. How many chops? Fucking big bag full. Oh, serious. Come on, can't you be serious for a minute? Well count them, feel them. Ten, eleven, twelve... Hang on, hang on, one... two... three, four... Don't be worrying, you'll be getting your share. Come on. Jesus Christ! Can you smell that? I thought it was you. It's farted! Come on, let's get it down there. Hold onto it and I'll get one good shot at its napper. Have you got it? Let's get it down then. Go on, get hold of it. Smack it. Go on! How many times have you been in that position with a sheep? Never mind. Come on, hit it. Fucking hell! I should have done this job on me own. You're bleedin' hopeless. And watch me. Don't hit me. Just give it. Just give it one. Ready? Go on. That's it. Go on! Fuck it. Let's take it down the butchers. Get hold of the back end. You shit house. You shit house... Come on, you twat, look up, look up. Just give him a honk on the horn. Give over, with everybody's eyes round here? Here, I'll tell you what. You get out, get in the butcher's shop, I'll drive it round the back. Go. Be bloody quick, then. It'll feed the whole bleedin' town, I' telling you. Have a look at that. Hello, Bob. All right... Ah! You're pulling my pisser, aren't you? What do you mean? What I mean? That's mutton, that. Nobody wants mutton these days, they want lamb. Well it hasn't gone out of fashion. They're still eating it, aren't they? Yeah, of course. I'm not saying that. You're talking fourteen quid there. How much? /Fourteen quid, if that. I thought you said... Hang on... last one I sold I got thirty-odd pound for her. Not sheep, lad. On our kid's life! Thirty-odd pound. No. This is another bollock I've dropped now. Is there nothing at all you can do for us? Well have a look at it. It's massive. Well, let's have a look at it then, Bob. Oh, Jesus! Told you it was a big bastard, isn't it? Big bastard! It fucking stinks! That's because it's been pissing and shitting all up the sides of my van. Oh, stop moaning! Fucking hell! Can't do owt with that. We can't take it back to the moors, can we? Listen... listen are you going to fucking kill it for us, and chop it up or what? Well, get it in back of shop, then. Fucking hell! Watch you don't pull its fucking head off. I'd like to pull his head off, I'm telling you. I'd like to pull yours off! Do you know you, you've never stopped moaning from this morning. Come here... Now listen, Bob. I'll do this if you put that fireplace in for us. Fair enough, that sounds okay. Yeah. It's all plumbed in and everything. The bloke did it. I paid him. Done a runner. Well, you can't trust anyone, that's fair enough lad, yeah, go on. That's all right, yeah? Yeah, okay, I'll do it. Come on. Come on lad, get its head head over this bucket. Okay Bob, get hold of its ears. Pull its ears back. Go on. Head back, keep hold of him. Just cut it. Dirty bastard! Jesus, he's cut its fucking throat! Before I go to Communion... I will listen carefully to the priest at Mass. I will tell God that if I am sorry... if I have spoilt my love for Him... by choosing something that He does not want. I have nothing to eat or drink for one hour... it is not a very long time and it is to... it is to remind me of the great Son of God who will come. Before I go to Communion... I will listen carefully to the priest at Mass. I will tell God... I want to grow up like Jesus... and I want to meet Him in Communion. Very good. Very good. Thank you, Coleen. Thank you. Now you see... the Church, well we call it Mother Church... has decided that when a child reaches the age of seven... the age of reason... it's time for the parents to prepare them for their first Holy Communion. So the parents must teach that child about the loving family of God... and that their first Communion marks the beginning of a beautiful friendship with Christ. I'll take the vault, lad. Okay, I'll get 'the room'. Jesus! You've started early, haven't you? Hello, girls. This could be your lucky day. Have a look in this basket. Best mutton. Look at that. Fresh as a daisy. Two pound fifty the leg. What do you mean 'no'? A beautiful piece of meat, that. No? You sure? You don't eat meat? /All right, love. Hiya, mate. Look at this bit of flavour, eh... look at this, real English mutton. Look at that... I'm sorry, mate. I'm sorry, I'm skint. Skint? I know exactly how you feel, pal... Can I do you a favour, lads? Fair enough... Hello folks, here you are, have a look at this. Real English mutton. Look at that. Beautiful leg of mutton. Just done it before I came in here. Hiya, Walt! Hiya Bob, you all right? Have a look at that for a leg of mutton. Beautiful leg of mutton, that. How much? /Two-fifty. No, I'II, I'll give you two quid for it. Two twenty-five. No, two pound or nothing. Sold to the girl over there. Do you want a bag with it? Yes, please. There you are, love. Put it in that bag. Yeah, over there, love. Have a look at them chops. What d'you reckon, Cissie? D'you want owt? Breast? Chops? How much? One-fifty your chops, love. Bit warm though, aren't they? Hello there Paddy, me old son. Not Paddy. Come to do you a favour, son. Have a look at that. Now you can fuck off! I, I, that's not very nice, is it? Just fuck off... all right? Who d'you think you're talking to, Paddy, old son? I'm not a dickhead, you know. Eh? Sudden death... or a broken jaw? Ah, just get your face away before I tread all over you. Okay, Pad. Any time you like. /Thank you very much. Anything for the weeken, boys? Anything at all, lads? Jesus wept! How'd you go on in that vault? Crap. Couldn't sell it. Couldn't even give it away. How did you do? Four-and-a half quid. Four pound fifty! That all? So where's all this fucking money we're going to make according to you? Oh, come on Bob, you haven't given it a proper chance yet, have you? Give over... We'll have to try some other pubs, won't we? The Carters Arms, the Horse and Jockey and all the others. I'll even take some of it up to Rhodes. Well, what do you say? Okay, yeah. Can we have a pint first? Halfs. Put your meat on the tray, I'll put it in the back of the van. 'Scuse me, love. Can I have two halves of bitter, please? Bob. /What? Order us one of them meat pies, will you, lad? And a meat pie, love, please. Hello, Tommy... /Hello, Tony. By the way, Tommy, any chance of that fiver you owe me? I give it to young Bob to give you. Hasn't he given it you back? Nobody's given me anything. He's a bugger... he gets me into all sorts... I'll make sure you get it back, son. Okay, cheers, Tommy... Ta-ta, pal. "Send Joe to Lourdes all donations welcome. " There's your pie. Ta, lad. How's that young Joey going on? Little Joey Young? /Aye. You know me fell off bloody roof. /Aye, I know. And he wasn't even employed bloody legally, was he? That means he won't get a penny back. /That's right. Now joking aside, we're having a bit of a collection. See if we can send him to Lourdes. Did you hear about the kid from Liverpool in the bloody in the bloody wheelchair they took to Lourdes? They got him to the water's edge and he couldn't get in because his legs was twisted... so they had to hire a little crane... and pick him and the wheelchair up... over the water... and submerge him. And when he come out they all had a look at his legs... and his legs were still twisted. But the wheelchair... had two new tyres on it. Where's the van? /It's gone, hasn't it? I can see that, you dozy pillock. Where the fuck is it? Well, I don't know, lad. It was there ten minutes, only. Well, where's the keys? You've left them in the van, haven't you? /Yeah. You dozy fucking bastard! You left them in the van! I've a good mind to... All right. Hang on. The bleedin' police could have towed it away. There was no tax, or nothing on it, was there. Excuse me, love, you've not seen a green van go round here, have you? A what? /A green van. No... No, why, has somebody pinched it? I've only been in there ten minutes. You know, they're bastards. Take the eyeballs out of your head here, they would. Hey, lads, you haven't seen a van being taken out of here, have you? With all the meat in? Took the lot, Walt. They took everything. Yeah, they've took the lot. You know, I can't report this to the police either. It's not taxed and insured. Would've cost me fifty sixty quid just to get it through the MOT. That's twenty quid, innit? /I haven't got it, mate. Just don't have the money. What am I gonna do, Tommy? Let's go and have a look. You haven't seen a van round here, have you, son? Oh! Where's your key? How was our Coleen? Our Coleen were absolutely great. You should have been there. Yeah. Yeah. Father Barry asked her to read. She just went up... I think I were more nervous than her. How did you go on? We got us a sheep. You want to watch it, Bob. Somebody catches you. Look... how much is this Communion going to cost us? For the dress? Yeah. Er... we can't get her dress without getting her shoes. How much? What's up? Nothing. What are you snapping at me for? I'm not snapping, I asked you a question. How much? God, you only just got in and you're snapping at me. I'm not snapping. How much? About seventy, eight quid. Jesus Christ. I told you last night it were going to be something like that. Yeah... What is wrong with you? Eh? I've had the van nicked. Oh, Jesus! Outside the Falcon. I was only in there for ten minutes with Tommy, flogging the meat. Come out and me bloody van's gone. What you going to do? I can't go to the police, can I. I had a nice little scaffolding job lined up with that next week. Two or three days work. At least it would have kept our heads above water. Now... I've blown it. /Oh... it don't matter. No wheels. No job. We'll manage. /How "we'll manage"? Where we going to find that kind of money? We're already scratching as it is. Sommat'll turn up. All right. Oh yeah? At least with the van... I could have done a few days work. A bit here, a bit there. But now! Now. I can't get anything. Look, there's no law that says she has to have a new dress. I say. /Father Barry won't mind. I'm not bothered about Father Barry. Look, that dress I got her last year, that one'll be fine. Oh, fine. She walks up the aisle looking like a pauper... while all her mates are clobbered up to the hilt. Will she heck look like a pauper, don't be daft! Listen, you had a Communion dress when you... were a kid, didn't you? Yeah, but... yeah... Well so will our Coleen. I don't know how long it takes, or what I've got to do. Anyway, how long is it? /Only six weeks. Well she's going to get a dress. How? /I don't bloody know! You're talking daft now. How many bills have we got to pay? Gas, electric. Phone's already out and you're talking about a dress! I'm talking about the most important day in our Coleen's life. Is your dad down the Tenants Association tomorrow? Should be. Why? /Just wondered... You took your Pill? /I always do. I always feel like I'm committing a sin. Hey... We're not fucking animals just because we've got on work, you know... you're fucking parasites! Do you know what you want? Eh? You listen to me, bollocks! Do you know what you want? A fucking revolution! Do you know what I think of you? Eh? Here we go, here we go, here we go... So these two are yours? Yeah, I've got another one at home, Liam, who is eleven years old. Right. These are both under five? Under five, yeah. Is Jimmy in? Er, yes. He's on the phone, Bob. Do you want to sit down for a minute. He shouldn't be that long. Cheers. So that's, that's your worse problem, the electric, isn't it? Well, that's my immediate one, yeah. Right, well, you'll have to leave that with me. I'll have to see what I can... I'll have to speak to somebody else and, you know, I'll see what I can do about that. Yeah... so what else have you got? And, um... I had the, the sink in the kitchen leaked for two years... and the water leaked out and ruined all the carpets and everything. And so I had to replace all the carpets and... the, um, the Treasury Department sent me a cheque for a hundred and fifty pounds. The carpets cost me four hundred quid... I've got in here. Listen, I've got to go to a meeting, Jimmy. /I'm still not happy, man. I've got to go to a meeting, Jimmy. Well, you're the Labour, you're the Labour Councillor for the estate. I said I'll see to it. You've said that more times than Soft Mick and it's got them no where. That's a lie, Jimmy. /Let me tell you this. You'll not tell me anything. Wait till we start holding the rent back. Then you will be in deep shit, my friend. You're not worth a tripe supper! /No... And no wonder that Labour keep losing the elections! Wants goosin' with the raw ends of a pineapple, him. Hello, Bob. How are you? Hiya, Jimmy. /What is it? Listen, you still got them rods that Kevin Gill lent you? Yes, somewhere in the house, lad, yeah. What's up? Do you think he'd lend them me? No problem. No problem. I thought I'd go out and earn myself a few bob rodding a few drains, like. You know, it's been raining all week... Well, why not? Why not? Give me a couple of hours here. Slip up to our house and I'll sort them out for you. Anne and Coleen all right? /Yes, they're fine. See you later on, son. Bye-bye. Yeah, cheers. See you. Hello, love, I'm in the area cleaning drains and I wondered whether you'd like yours doing? No. I'm a little busy. I can come back later, if you like. No, it's all right, thanks. I have my hands full. Okay. Thank you. Excuse me, mate... /Yeah? Do you want your drains doing? /Drains? Yeah. I'll make a hell of a good job of them, I'll set me rods out, rod 'em out for you, whatever you want. No, mate. No, mate. Nothing wrong with these drains. Did them myself last week. You sure? /Positive. Ok, thank you. Fine, see you. No, no. Thank you very much. We've got somebody that does that. Okay, thank you, love. Bye. Can you tell me what exactly you do? Yeah, what I do basically, is lift your manhole cover off... put my rods together... /Yeah... hmm-mm... rod it through and make sure it's clean and clear for you. Sounds a good idea cos we've had blockages before. Have you? /Yeah. Oh, then I'm your man. /Sounds good, that. I could get that done and then probably come in and check your bathroom for blockagees up there. Come in your kitchen, check your kitchen with my plunger. Sounds great. Just what we need, that. Get in, you. /Why? Get in. Shut it. Listen pal, I don't care what you're flogging... whatever it is, we don't want it. Now piss off! All right, mate, yeah, see you. What have I told you before about going out there with no clothes on and nothing... I'm in the area doing drains... and I wondered if you'd like yours cleaned out. There's nothing wrong with my mains. I've had them checked. Nothing at all wrong with my mains. Not your mains, drains. No. I've had them checked. There's nothing wrong with them. Drains! D-r-i... drains! I keep telling you, there's nothing wrong with my mains. Not your bloody mains! Your drains! There's no need for that language. Oh, aye... Anyway, I'm not bothered, there's no need for that language at all. So you don't want your mains doing? No. /Ta-ta, then. Ah, Bob! /Morning, Father. Can I help you? I just wondered if you had any drains that might need rodding out. Well, that's very good of you. I have a manhole round the back that needs to be looked at, come on. You're the right man in the right place. Oh, my God! Yeah. We sometimes have difficulty in flushing the toilets. That's because all the shit's coming back on you, Father, and getting blocked. And these drains look as though they're collapsing to me. You're going to need new ones soon. Oh, we can't afford it. I'm sure if it wasn't for people like yourself helping us for free, we'd never never get anything done. Can I help you at all? No, you step back, Father. I'll carry on with this. I'll soon have done. Okay, okay. Give us a shout when you're ready and I'll put the kettle on. Okay, Father, yeah. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh! Bloody hell! Oh, Jesus Christ! Jesus! Jesus! I think that did the trick, Bob. I think so, Father. /Oh, my God... I hope that fits you, Bob. /Thank you, Father. Every man has the right to work, Bob... and should not be subjected to the butt of criticism when he fails to find it... through no fault of his own. It doesn't work like that though, Father. No, but it should. That's the way things are nowadays. Come on, and help yourself to the biscuits. Thank you. About Coleen's Communion... /Yeah? There's no reason for you and Anne to be going into any debt because of it. We'll manage, Father. Middle-class parents don't spend half as much. That's because their kids run round in new clothes all the time. You can celebrate Communion without any fuss or expense. Oh, I know it's a Catholic tradition to lash out on... dress, flowers and photographs... but it isn't necessary. But that's all part of it. Love and prayer is enough, Bob. I don't want our Coleen missing out, Father. She won't. When she walks up that aisle... I want her to look as smart as the rest of them. Which she will. This is her big day. /Yes, I know that. And ours. This is once in a life time. You'll not be... embarrassed if I suggest something? Depends. The school has dresses available to people who can't afford... just for the day. You mean cast-offs. /Not at all. I'm talking about dresses that have been donated. You're talking about dresses that kids have worn. In immaculate condition. /No thanks, Father. No one else would know. Anne and I would. It'll cost you a pretty penny, Bob. We'll manage somehow, Father. We'll manage. Bye, now. Have you worked since you last signed? No. Hello, lad. You just been to sign on? Yeah... Look, I'm sorry about the other day with the van. Ah, forget it, mate. No, it were my fault. I should've been more bloody careful. Anyway, listen. You can now do me a favour. Anything. What is it? Go and get yourself signed on... then we'll go and have a nobble. Just do us a favour, try and pick a few winners. I can't pick my bloody nose. Right, right, come on! Go on dad, have a shot at it. Goal! Our kid's back! /Is she? Yeah... /Where is she? In there with me mum. Where's Sean? Gone to the shops. She's give us two quid. Two quid! She must be loaded. Pick this out, son. Oh, yes, there's a gap! Oh! What a save! A goal! How are you, kid? Fine, dad. You all right? Yeah... Turn that bloody head-banging gear off, will you, love? Blimey, it's a wonder you've got any ear drums left. Where's your mum? /She's on the loo. Is she? /Hm-mm... So how are you doing? /I'm okay. Well, you look okay, just got little black marks under your eyes, though. Dad, that, that's me make-up. Make-up? /Yeah. Well, you look a little bit washy. Washy? Well, rundown, yeah. Are your eating properly? /Yeah, I feel great. Well how's the flat doing? It's great! Paying your rent every week? You bloody make sure you do. /Hi, Tom. Shift your arse... Yeah, all right. There's some tater'ash in the pan. Is it hot? Yeah. Just cooked it. Get myself a bowl now. Oh, by the way, er... madam... how long are you staying this time? Oh, a couple of hours. We're going down to the market in Middleton. Shouldn't be too long, though. Eh, she bloody changed, ain't she? She looks well. Not so long ago we were dragging her in off the bloody grass... and changing her drawers and putting her to bed, eh? Don't be disgusting. Ta-ta, then... All right, Tracey? Let's get going. /Let me just do me hair. Your hair's all right. /No, it's not. Yeah, it is. Has he still not got a job yet? No... just goes down and signs on, that's it. Doing his head in. Sending him mental, it is. Still, you've landed on your feet, haven't you? /Yeah. So you're doing all right, are you, babe? Yeah, and it pays well. Tommy, don't put that plate on that table, you'll burn it. Bloody hell, it's not going on bloody Antiques Road Show, is it, May? So what is you're doing exactly? Sales... What, selling? /Yeah. Selling what? Um... selling perfume, make up. Selling that stuff? Bloody hell! Over a hundred quid a week. You get a hundred quid a week! Yeah, with commission, though. You couldn't do us a favour, could you? Go on. Bottle all my experience in the engineering game, which is over thirty years, by the way... cor blimey, we'd all make a fortune. I'll just get me coat. Still no luck then, no? There's nothing doing anyway, love, is there? Fresh air sandwiches here at Christmas, I'm afraid. Here you are, dad. What's that? Get yourself a drink. Don't want that, chuck. Honest, things are not that bad. If it was mine, he'd take it off me. May, that would be different wouldn't it? Oh, dad! I treated me mum and the lads... She's loaded now, Tommy. She can afford it. /Go on. You sure? /Yeah, here you are. Tell you what... when I win the pools... I'll buy you a George Formby long player, okay? Right, Tracey. See you later, Tommy. See you... bye. Hiya. Do you... still do Communion dresses? Yeah, we do. Is it for the little girl? /Yes. Right, okay, um... well do you want me to through the prices with you first? Please. Okay, um, do you want a full outfit? Yeah, we do. Yeah. /Right. Our dresses start from fifty pounds... and they go up to ninety pounds. Then you want a head-dress. That's a really nice ring of flowers you get... they're three twenty-five up to five ninety-nine. Then you want, um, a veil... from five ninety-nine up to nine ninety-nine. Oh, unless of course you want us to provide you with a consett... What's that? It's the head-dress and the veil combined. It's actually what most people are buying these days. It would look really lovely on her. How much is it? Um... they're sixteen ninety-nine up to twenty-nine ninety-nine. Oh, and then, you want white gloves two ninety-nine. Is that it... is that it? /Yes. Well... do you want to go home and have a think about it? Yeah... yeah, I think we should. No, there's no point. We'll go for it. Where are we going to find a hundred and fifteen quid? A hundred and five. You've already put ten down, haven't you? Oh, yeah. And that's why we're walking home instead of getting a bus. Will you just shut up... And there's the shoes. We've got to get the shoes as well, another twenty quid. We'll find it. Don't worry about it. Oh, yeah. Mister Moneybags! Will you shut up! Well, it's bloody stupid, isn't it? Oh, stop moaning, woman! /Coleen, come on, hurry up! When am I getting my dress? Soon as all the alterations have been made. What? Then you'll get your dress. Soon as the alterations have been made. Jesus! Can't you just shut up! Don't take it out on her! She can wrap you right round her little finger. Get hold of her hand crossing this road. Right. Come on, hurry up. Anyway, it's so happens, I've made meself a few quid. You what? Whoops, eh... I had a 25p win yankee on the horses and it's come up. Well why... Don't tell that Tommy, though or he'll be tapping us. Why didn't you tell me? I was letting you sweat a bit. Right, how much? Right, Coleen, what I'm going to tell you now... I want you to listen to me very, very carefully. Okay? Well, you know about Our Lord, don't you, he was crucified on the cross... well... the night before he was crucified... he... he got all his mates round... round a big cable... and they had a big tea. Did he eat beans like us? I think he probably ate his up. Oh, very clever. Get in the kitchen, I'm doing me best here. The reason he had all his mates round for this tea... was because he knew he was going to die. How did he know? Well, because he's Christ. Christ knows everything! Why couldn't he run away? /Oh, bloody hell! Don't they teach you anything at school? Well, they told me about confession. Oh, forget confession, get confession right out of your head. We're not talking about confessions, we're talking about Communion. Right, what happened... Jesus gets His Disciples... Who's telling this, Anne, me or you? You! We'll be out here all night... way you're telling it. So what he did was, He got all his mates there like... and He picks up a piece of bread... and He takes like... a piece of the bread off like that... and He holds it up to His mates... and He says... "This is me. This is my body. " Right? And then He He got hold of His cup... What's the next one, Anne? "This is my blood. " Oh, aye... picks up His cup, or his goblet... and He says to His mates... "this is my blood. " Yeah, but I don't want to drink Christ's blood. It's not real blood! It's just a glass of wine! How come you said that it were blood, then? Because it means like... it's the blood of Christ... it represents the blood of Christ. It's blood and it's wine. Do you understand now? You don't, do you? It's like... it's like when you die, you go to Heaven. Aye, well, if you've had no... if you've not had your Holy Communion you can't get in. Do you understand what I'm talking about? No. Well, look at me. /I'm looking. He gives you the present of life so that when you die you can go to Heaven. If you don't have Communion, you can't go to Heaven. Now do you understand? /No. Oh, bloody hellfire! Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, five... Thanks, love. Bye, now. All right, Bob? Hello, Ted. Do you know a bloke called Gilbert? Gilbert? Yeah, small guy, moustache. He's a smart-arse. He owes Tansey money. No. I don't know him, mate. I just wondered if you'd seen him about. No. Don't know him. Bye... All right, Tracey? I can't really give you that money... Never mind you can't give it me. You know what the trouble is... It doesn't matter about the kids. We want the money. All right? Yes, mate? Dave Ward sent me down. I'm looking for a guy called Mike. Yeah? He said there might be a couple of nights work here. Didn't realise that we were advertising for a fucking pot collector. Right. I suppose I'd better get you kitted out. That's all we fucking need... You worked in the clubs before, mate? Well, I did two years in the bar... bar at the Milbeck. Do you know what the job entails? Well, I can handle myself, if that's what you mean. What sort of training do you do? Training? See, training's looking after yourself. I play table tennis now and then. Do you know what sort of club this is? He's a comedian. Well, I can see it's not a fucking ballroom dancing club! No, this is a rave club, dummy! Do you know how to do a proper body search? I'll soon learn. Do you know how to handle people when they threaten you with knives and guns... Well, we all get together, don't we, and sort it out? It's like the old day... Yeah, it's as simple as that. It 'eight' fisticuffs at dawn. Let's see what we got in me toy box for you. Oh, Jesus Christ! It stinks, man. You're joking, aren't you? /It's a Riko's jacket, that one. Yeah, it's to keep the muggers away. Shark repellant, I think... That's it... lovely... Looks younger already. I wouldn't go that fucking far! Overstatement, sorry! Mutton dressed as lamb. Be on the Clothes Show next. Leave it out, boys. I've only come for a fucking job, not an audition as a comedian. Pants. Where do I put these on? Just stick 'em on now. He's shy now... Have you got something different to us, eh? We'll find out what a real man he is. Show us what you white boyes have got. Whoa! Cool man, look at them undies. Fucking hell, he's got a sunbed! Do you shave them legs or wax them? What? Thought you said I was working with professionals. He's a fucking pervert! Doesn't hang on the door though, do you fucking Eric! Hey, easy, get off me case. Not so much a Chippendale, more an MFI. Hey, Bob... he went "wait" training once. Stood at a bus stop for half-an-hour. The track is... you're in three nights a week. Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Fifty-five quid a night. In at ten o'clock, any later, you're out. No drinking and smoking on duty. If you're found with a drink or a fag in your hand... you're out. And no fucking around with the women. Yeah, I know, "Or your out!" Get us a drink! She's got something... Tracey! Jesus Christ! /Bob! Listen! Are you out of your head or what? What? Don't give me that! I just stood and watched you! It's only... I'm not on about that! Everyone's at it in here. That's why the place is rocking! I've just seen you! You've just passed something to a bloke down there and he's giving you money. You're a pusher! Come on, I'm taking you home. /Get off me! Your dad will bleedin' kill you! /Will you let go of me! Come on, I'm taking you home an all... Is this the ponce you're pushing for? Listen, mate! /You fucking get off! Fucking get down there, you bastard! /You fucking twat! I'll kill you, you bastard! /He's a fucking lunatic! What's the fucking score then, eh? He's a fucking drug pusher! Has anyone seen any fucking drugs? He's seen fuck all! Fuck him off! No! Fucking keep him, I'll sort it out... The girl's that pushing for him, I know her! Yeah? /Yeah. We fucking know her. She's a fucking slag! Her fucking father's a friend of mine! Who gives a fuck! Look at the fucking state of your jacket. Get it off! You're nothing but a fucking balloon, you are. Don't fucking need you here. Look... fucking twenty quid. Be fucking grateful you got that, you cunt. Does that mean I'm fucking fired? Yeah, count yourself lucky! /You fucking bastard! "Drug alert no to drugs Say no to drugs" Come on! Come on, Rambo. Oh leave it out, love. I hardly touched you. All right... Hope so... I'll tell you what, you're going to have a shower and in the morning... Try this, love... Bad... now this is going to sting. I don't know where to start. Keep still! Jesus Christ, it stings! Morning, Bob. /Morning, Tommy... Bloody hell, it's nippy, isn't it, lad? Right through the bones now, mate. Eye-eye! You been looking through key holes? /Get away... What have you done to your eye? /Had a bit of a fight last night. Fighting? Bet the other fella doesn't go to school this morning. I tried me hand at that bouncing game. You must be a bloody crackpot, that's only for young bulls, that, lad. Wages, Tommy. Wages. What did Anne say? Well, I got slung, didn't I, so there's not much she can say, is there now? What, you got the sack on your first night? Well and truly. Just as bloody as well. Listen, this mate of yours, you know, is he all right or what? Sound as a pound. I've worked with him loads of times. And what's this job we're doing, and where are we going? I don't know where it is and what we're doing. I told you everything I know. That's all I know. Digging up turf? Yeah, he's a bloody ladscape gardener. Here he is now. Jesus, look at the state of it. All right, Dixie? This your mate? /Yeah. Jump in the back. /Sound as a pound. Give us a shout when you're in. Okay... okay! Not worth getting out of bed for. Go away! A tenner for two hours work's not bad, is it? We'll be back home before the kids go to school. Why can't we get involved in laying it? We'd make a few more bob out of that. He's got another gang there doing it, that's why. He's got a couple of gangs working for him then, has he? Got loads fellas working for him. He has one gang cutting it, one gang laying it. But he's got gangs all over the bloody country. Does loads of work, you know, Dixie. You'd think he'd have a decent van... Jesus Christ! What does he want a decent van for, for bloody old soil and wheelbarrows and spades! That's pushed my piles back about a fortnight. All right, let's get these shovels moving here. Eh, where are we? The Con Club. Conservative Club? /Yeah. We're not nicking their fucking turf, are we? You're not a Tory, are you? /No. Well what are you worried about then? Yeah, the caretaker lives miles away, there's no problem... all you've got to do... is heads down... arses up... let's get into gear and make a couple of bob, come on... Here you are, Kevin Keegan. You get over here and take this corner... Hurry up... What am I going to do? Roll them over and take them back to the wagon... Come here... Keep in a straight line, make them about a foot long... so you can roll them up like a carpet... Here you are, dopey arse, you get over here. Now go in sections as fast as you can... a couple of barows and we're up the road, all right! Now come, Dean, hurry up, lad, will you! Too early for this sort of stuff for me. I've got a bad back. Hey you, can't you keep up with me here or what? Oh, keep them neat, will you, lad... come on, Tommy just make it safe there... Oi! Oh no! Communist bastards! We can pick up a roller from a scrap-yard dirt cheap. All you want then is a roll of twine, a couple of pegs... couple of banjoes, a plank, a wheelbarrow and a rake. We're on our way. Yeah, to do the businesses properly. Now, it all depends if I get my hands on a van. Just put an advert in the local paper. And I'll need me phone putting in. Correct. As soon as a local punter rings up... I go down, measure the job... go nick the turf, lay it down, get paid all in the same day. You ever done it before? Dead easy, lad, like laying carpet tiles, isn't it? Just make sure the underneath's dead flat. Where do we get the turf from? Parks, gardens, cemeteries... And Conservative Clubs! Well that's the best quality stuff. We get a few extra bob for that, don't we? But I've got to get a van. Where we going to get a van from? To ensure tenancy arrangement under the private landlords... So, where does the difference come in? The difference is you've got no you've got no protection... If you get any problems at all, give us a shout. Yeah, okay. Hello, Bob. /Hello, Jimmy. This is my son-in-law, Bob. Pleased to meet you... This is Ken Rider, councillor. Second prize again, eh? I hope you got it fighting for the working class. I've got to go now. Give us a ring. /Nice one. No problem. All right, son. Listen... I'm after a van. You don't know anyone, do you? A van? Yeah, nothing fancy. Have you got the money? Depends on the price. But without a van I can't work. Er... hang on, I'm sure there's a card come in yesterday. Cheers, Jimmy. Yeah... this is it. This is it. Only come in yesterday this, Bob. Let's look at that. Two-sixty! Well he won't rip you off, you know... you know Cliff, don't you? Cliff... oh, is that the little guy always wears a boiler suit full of grease? Lives on Hollins. I'll give that a look at, cheers. You're looking a mess, you know, son. I feel a mess. Listen, what did this Communion dress cost you? Oh, has our Anne been talking? Anne hasn't mentioned it, son. Young Coleen's been coming around telling me all about it... and I put two and two together... you know, it must have cost you a bomb. Yeah, a good few quid, yeah. But I'll manage. Aye, so I see. Look. /No, you look! I've got a lot of respect for you, Jimmy... but this is none of your business. Bobby... we're family. Look, I got meself in this mess, I'll get meself out. Not through the Church you won't, son. What's the Church got to do with it? Because you're looking for answers and there isn't any... because they're part of the problem. Look, you've got your beliefs... I've got mine. Okay? No, what you've got is fear. And five Hail Marys ain't going to help what ails you. Because all this religious mumbo-jumbo... all it does is tire your mind and stop you thinking for yourself. Look, Jimmy, the last thing I need right now is a lecture. Or a sermon. No what you need is a job and there aren't any. Oh, now tell us something I don't know. When you're a worker, it 'rains stones' seven days a week. And then it pisses down on me. Ah, not only on you, Bob... you see, you're walking around with this individual guilt... and this is what they want. It's destroying you. God knows, you know, given half the chance I know you're a grafter. It's not done us much good, though, has it? We never invented the system, son... but it's up to us to change it. What's that? /Slanging match. Smack-heads! But she can't be any more than fifteen. You've got my ring! I haven't, Ellen! I haven't got your ring! Well you've got me money then, haven't you? No! Cos I want to score tonight as well. You're a liar! You're a liar! I need to score tonight. You know for a fact... What chance have they got? You know, one or two might slip through the net... but for the rest of them, it's, you know, it's mapped out... it's all cut and dried. They've got no work... no hope... it's all despair. All the they've got is crime, booze, drugs... families just breaking up. And do you know, it could be a lovely estate to live on. Do you know, we're like punch drunk fighters hammering at each other... instead of us getting together and sharing around the power for us to make all the changes... and that's all it is in a nutshell, the rest is propaganda. It'll do about thirty to the gallon on the road. Let's have a look round here... Hang on, hang on a minute, Tommy... Well, you have a look. I'll have a look here. Yeah, but Tommy... Oh, come on Cliff, play the game, look at the bloody bodywork, son. What's wrong with that? Jesus Christ, there's more filler here than on Barbara Cartland's face! There's some spots of fillers... Look at that, the tyres are bleedin' baldy. They're remoulds. Yeah? Yeah, well, you don't see the tread with remoulds, do you. You're joking, aren't you! I've seen more rubber on a bleedin' French letter! You must have a big French letter. You've got new tyres on the front! Hey, Cliff... I'm having it. Right, how are you having it, then? Is there any chance of us, er... knocking the price down? Oh, here we go now, knock it down! How many owners has it had? Owners! Only one owner! Who was it, fucking Ben Hur? /Who's Ben hur? Come on, Cliff! Does he live on the Estate? Cliff, Cliff... I'm buying the thing, right? Can we knock it down to two hundred? How can you do that, I've got to make some money... He's lost his mother! I'm going to lose my wife if I sell it for any less than that. Two hundred? No, two sixty, and that's it. Cliff, I haven't got that amount of money on me. What about if we can come to some sort of deal? Can I pay you weekly... So you're paying half the price of the two sixty, right? And a tenner a week. Can you manage that? I don't want any pissing about. If you say a tenner a week, I want it. Mum! Dad's got a new van! I'm going downstairs and see him. Hey, dad! /Coleen... Yeah, look at this! What! Is is this ours! /Like it? Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Come on, let me show you the inside. What do you think? That's ours? /Yeah, it's not bad, is it? Why didn't you tell me you were getting a van? It came out of the blue. A bargain, two sixty. Snatched his hand off. Two sixty? Look, the bloke I'm getting it off is a mate of mine. And he says I can pay him back bit-by-bit once I start earning the money. Ah, come on, this is us, kid, we're on our way up now. I can start earning wages with this. In fact, I've already pulled one little job on the way down. Yeah? /Moving a little bit of furniture... so it's a start. Oh, it's got to be right, this. It's going to make it for us. So what do you reckon? Well, it could do with a bit of a clean, couldn't it? Bit of elbow grease and it'll be fine, this. Dad, when can we have a ride in it? Later love, later. But for now... you can sit in the driver's seat and play with the steering wheel. There you go. Get in there. Have a go on the steering wheel. Hey, can earn some money with this, love. Brilliant! Ta-ta, love... Hello, Gilbert. Hello, Bob. Are you all right? Yeah, fine. Better now. I know what you mean, mate, yeah. Yeah, see you later then, Bob. You little shithead! /I was going to pay you! Oh, yeah! Were you? I've got the money! I was going to pay you! I've got the money! I want it now! I've got it! You never give me a chance. When you borrow money, you pay it back. Right. /Right! And never mind spending it at bookies. Look, we want this every week... Right... /Every week. You owe a lot of money! /Right! Right! Don't spend it in the bookies... I'm warning you! /I won't! A warning! /Okay... Oh, yes... part time cleaners... evening shifts for city centre. Mmm... that looks all right, doesn't it, where is it? Oh, Stretford. Waste of time, isn't it, that? Travel'd be a week's wages, wouldn't it? See if there's anything else. "Returning to work... " Mum? Yeah? Can I have some money to go to the chippy, please? Oh, he's always after money, our Sean. Come here. Ta. Um... Right, I want some change. Okay... I shouldn't be too long, right. I'll be home in a bit. Mum... can I play out... /Come straight home, bye. Yeah, of course you can. Put your coat on. "... earn pounds at home. Experienced machinists required... for making baby buggy hoods and aprons. " Aye, I wonder how much that is? It's usually cash in hand. I used to get 12p an apron... and if I really was good, you know, disciplined myself and put the hours in... I'd get between ten and twelve quid a day. Sounds like it'd do us, that. You've got to be fast. I've not sewed in ages. Soon get back into the swing of things, don't you. Eh, mum... /Yeah... yeah? An ambulance has just pulled up outside Mrs Whittaker's house and the people in the chippy said that she's took an overdose... Let's have a look. You know, it doesn't surprise me, this. She got caught for doing the meter. Did she? /Yeah, about three weeks ago. You know, it gets you like that, dunnit? Yeah, but throwing the towel in's not the answer, is it? She's got three kids, for Christ's sake. Mmm... it's funny how we start off, innit, with all these big ideas... and you realise that things aren't going to change... Well... no... Like Bob's prospects. When's he going to get a job? Well, Tommy's like that, he's been trying for ages, he's give up now. Do you know... I'll live and die in that flat and nobody'll even know. But at least you're not on your own, are you? I reckon we should go out one night... and get ourselves a couple of sugar daddies. Do you reckon? /Yeah... Isn't it gorgeous? /It's lovely. She looks like a princess. /It's lovely, isn't it? Go on, Coleen, give us a twirl. Oh, yeah... now walk up and down. Put your hands together as if you're going to the altar. Oh, she looks great. Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy... seventy-five, eighty, ninety, a hundred... and four pounds. I'll just get your change. Keep close to the edge, love. No, you're going too far away from the edge. You're wasting too much material, love. You've got to keep that edge, keep it closer to the edge. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, love! Come on! You're running riot! Try and keep as close to... I don't want any wastage at all, love. What did you work on before? Um... kid's coats. Kid's coats! My God, I bet you had a lot of waste on them. Go on, then... whoa! What? Listen, love... ...keep your edges together. I want to keep it close. Lift your foot. Lift the foot. It's you, you make me nervous. You're making me ner... you're making me nervous, love... ...look at that wastage on that material. Can make a belt out of that. Just try... I'll be all right once I get... Have you got a machine at home? /No, not yet. You haven't got one at home! /No... Well how do you expect to sew? Er... I'm going to hire one. Well, I can't be working on that, love. We need a job... ...whoa, whoa, whoa whoa! Girl! Bloody hell! Gift the thing up! No, I'm sorry, love. /What? I'm sorry, love. You haven't got a clue, have you really, love? Er, yeah. I'll try again... Come on, love. /Why? I haven't got time to train you, love. Well, give me a chance. No, go and practice on somebody else's material, lovey. What? /Off you go... here's your coat. /When I'm at home I'll be all right. Never mind. Off you go. When you've got some experience, come back. Off you go. Go on, love, go on. Wasting my bloody time, they do. They haven't got a clue about bloody sewing machines! Right... I've got everything for the mince pies, so I'm all right for that. All right? Yeah. Um... want some bread. /How many loaves? Two. Two loaves. Will that be enough? Yeah. Yeah, I've got a bit in. Um... Boiled ham. Get some salmon paste... yeah? Salmon paste... Yeah, Coleen likes that, doesn't she? A big bag of crisps. Oh, coke... What about the booze? What about it? Have to get a bottle of whisky. Don't have to get a bottle nothing. I do. That bloody brother-in-law of yours is coming. I'm not having that Tory-faced pillock saying he never got a drink in my house. Don't be daft. Give over. You know what he's like. What's up? Nothing, love. Nothing. Well, can you get a move on? Yeah, I'll see you later /All right. See ya. Yeah. Ta-ta, love. Here we are. Get it from here. Excuse me. Have you got a cake with icing on, please? Is that big enough? Yeah, that'll be fine, that. Yeah. Is that the lot or have you got to get anything else? Sausage meat... Fancy a little bet? You what? I got a couple of tips last night of Keith in the Carters' Arms. Go halves with me for a Yankee bet? Keith? At the Carters'! Oh, sod Keith and the bets, mate, listen... I'm up to me neck in the shit. What with? Have a look at that. Oh, bloody hell, lad... how much? You all right? /Yep. Can you get that for me? Your daddy in, sweetheart? /No, me mum is. Mrs Williams? /What are you doing? Nice to meet you, love. Look, you don't just come barging in somebody's house... Fucking shut it! You got a dickhead for a husband and he owes me money... You can't just come in me house. ...lots of it! Do you mean Bob? Ted, go up fucking stairs. Have a look upstairs. You're not going up me stairs. I've not got anything. No, you're not going up! Get out! Where is he? Look, get your... Where is he? I don't know where he is. Get him down my stairs now! I told you, he owes me money. Let me tell you the shit you're in! Tell your mate to get downstairs... He borrowed a hundred and fifty pounds. It's there in black and white. Look, he's not in. All right. He borrowed a hundred and fifty! Look... /Shut up! The people he borrowed it from... maintained it was for a Communion dress or something for a young girl. Probably that little girl there, was it? Paid four weeks, then pissed off. Get out, will you! Done the vanishing act. He's not here! But not from me, he doesn't! I bought the debt! Look, he's not here, so you... And now he owes me! And I get fucking paid. Don't come mithering me about it, I don't know anything about it. Altogether it's two hundred and eighty-five pound. Will you tell him to... Two hundred and eighty five pound, love, please. Two hundred... I've not got two hundred and eighty-five pound! How much have you got? Nothing. You must have something. I've not got anything! You must have something in the house. Oh, can you stop him! You just stop it in there! Anything upstairs, Ted? Look, he's gone and messed me kitchen up. Ted, anything upstairs! No, fuck all! Let's have a look at your fingers. No. You're not looking at my fingers... Let me have a look at your fingers! /What for? Hold your fucking hands out! /No! Hold your hands out! Take the rings off. /No! Take the rings off. This is me wedding ring. Pretty daughter, isn't it, that? You just leave her alone, and just get out! Do you want her to stay pretty? Just get out. Do you want her to stay pretty? Take the fucking rings off! Put them on the table. God... this isn't fair, this. No. Take them off! If you don't, he fucking will! Now take them off and put them down there! I don't believe this! Money. Where's your money? We haven't got any money. You must have some fucking money. There's no money! We're skint! Video? Where's your bag? I don't know. Where's your bag?

Get the money out! There's nothing in me bag. I haven't any money... You have no fucking money but you're living off me! Whose, fucking money bought this? Mine! Give me some money! I haven't got any. Open the fucking bag. Let me see. There is no money. I know... What's that! What is that? /Why... Take that out! What for? Give it to me. Give it to me! /That's me book... I need... That'll fucking do for starters. I'll be back for this when it's fucking due every Monday... and you can tell that fucking shit-house of a husband of yours... either he pays... we find him, we'll cut his fucking bollocks off! What am I going to do now? Then I'll come back and I'll rip it out your fucking arse! Do you fucking understand now, do you? Just please don't... Don't fuck about... with US! Now... ...let him fucking know that we'll be fucking back! Anne? Hi, love. Why didn't you tell me? /Tell you what? You borrowed that money, didn't you? You never come up on the horses. You borrowed it! Oh, I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry. Just get off! /Tell me what happened? They said things! They were really threatening. You should have seen them. What did they say? They said... They said Coleen were... ...was pretty. And did we want to keep her like that? I'm sorry, love. Look, I'm sorry... /It's all your fault! And they said they'd come back and take it out on my arse, that's what they said! Look, I'm sorry, love... You've got no bleedin' right, Bob! You really haven't. Look Anne, I'm just ducking and weaving just trying to keep my head above water... ...trying to get what I can. I'm sorry. You've got us all in the shit now. It's all down to me. Oh God... We'll have to go the police. We're going to have to do something! Oh, the police. They think we're a load of tosspots to start with. Oh shit! Don't go. Don't get it. Bob... Stay there. Just stay there. /Bob... Mum... It's Coleen, love. /Mum! Oh, Coleen... What the bloody hell's going on, lad? Oh, Jesus! Look at the mess in here. What's happening? They didn't hurt you, did they love? Them men didn't hurt you, did they? They took mummy's ring. Didn't they, mum? They got the ring. Yeah... Are you all right now? What else did they do? They push me over there and... ...and they got mummy's family allowance book. Hey, Coleen... when we've cleaned your mum's kitchen up, shall we make some more cakes... ...for your party? Eh, shall we do that? You sit there. Where are you going now? /I'm going out. Oh, don't be a dickhead! /Bob! Bob... don't be a dickhead. Get out the fucking way, right! Stop it! /No! You're out of your depth, lad! I need to do this. I'll fucking sort it out my way. You stay here, Tommy... Bob, don't be a dickhead! Think of these, lad. I'll fucking sort it out my way! Bob... Bob! /Leave it out, will you, son. City lost again! They want stuffing! Every week I get blamed... On your bike... You know me... you know me... Tansey, are we going for a flutter... Please. Let me come with you. /No, no... Let me come! Where you going... where are you going... Are we cabbing it tonight? Tansey, come on. Come with us, man. I'm away. I'm away. /No, come with us. I'm away, get yourselves away. Do me a fucking favour, get yourselves... ...have a good night, I'm away. See you... See you. Look after her. Look after her. I'm away. See you. Take care. Tansey! Who's that? What the fucking hell are you doing here? You called. /What? You came to my house and frightened the fucking life out of my wife and kid. What you fucking talking about? You know what I'm talking about. You owed me money. /Yeah, that's why I'm here. Come on. Into that, are we? With fucking folks like you, I am. Yeah. Come on. Keep coming. Listen... Just keep coming... Listen, you're gonna want somebody, aren't you? You're going to want somebody to look after you... /Just keep coming. ...help you get out the shit that you're in. Just keep coming... Somebody who can help you financially. /Just keep coming. I'll look after you... I'll look after you... Ah, fuck you! See you when I'm sober... I want that fucking book you've got with my name in it. You're fucking dead! /I'm already dead! And what I haven't got, you can't take from me! I want that book with my name in it. Crazy fucking bastard! I want that book with my name in! I want that book! Tomorrow, you fucking arsehole, I'm coming for your arse... ...and I'm going to shag your wife's arse off! You bastard! You bastard! Book... Bob? /I'm in trouble, Father. What do you mean? Come in. What is it, Bob? What's happening... Sit yourself down. What's up? I'm in terrible trouble, Father. What kind of trouble? I've been responsible for a man's death. You... you killed someone? No, it was an accident. An accident. I didn't mean to. To a man named Tansey. The loan shark? /Yeah... You fought with him? /Yeah... About what? /Money. You borrowed from him? No. I borrowed from a loan company... ...but I couldn't keep the payments up... ...and Tansey got hold of the debts. That's what he does. Debts and drugs. So I heard. How much? /A hundred and fifty pound. To pay for Coleen's dress? /Yes, it was the only way. Bob... I thought you had more sense. Hold your horses there for a second. I took these out of his pocket. What is it? It's the book with all the names in. That's the money they all owe. And if... if they don't pay he goes round and breaks their legs. That's why the call him the Collector. I boil up inside, sometimes I get angry. But I'm a grafter. I know that. I get up every morning and go looking for work, wherever it is... I'm a good Catholic, Father. I go to church, I believe in God, I pray... but it doesn't put food on the table. When did this happen? About an hour ago. So he's still lying in the car? As far as I know, yeah. Does anyone else know about it? No. Just us? /Yeah... What are you going to do about it, Bob? I'm going to have to go the police, what else can I do? But I don't... I don't want them going round telling Anne and Coleen... ...I want you to do that, Father, please. I want you to do it because I can't. I can't... /Why should you? What? Tell Anne. Tansey's dead. Fuck Tansey! May God have mercy on his soul. You didn't kill him. No. It was an accident. Yes, it was an accident. So why sacrifice your freedom and the happiness of your family? There's lots of good people on this Estate... ...will sleep easier in their beds because of his passing. They were afraid of him, Father. They were afraid of him. You came to me for advice and help. Then stay away from the police. Go home and pray for Tansey's worthless soul. Say nothing to Anne or to anyone. First thing we do is get rid of this lot. You're not an evil man, Bob. People like yourself are hungering for justice... in the name of Christ who was himself the bread of life... you deserve it. Now I'll hear your confession. In the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit, amen. Forgive me Father... for I have sinned. Over in that corner there... /Coleen? Hey, lads... /Coleen! Do you mind standing over in that corner there, please. Just over here. Come on, lads. Everyone line up just there. That's the idea. Just over there a little bit, son. Now, just come a bit closer in. That's it, and lift baby up. Just behave yourself. I know you don't want to be here but just behave yourself. Right. What, you got problems, mate? Just a minute... Did you hear about Tansey? I believe he became unstuck in a car crash. Unstuck! He's as dead as a bloody dodo! How did it happen? Just run into a concrete wall or something. Pissed? Stoned out of his head, I believe. Couldn't have happened to a nicer fella. Mr Williams can I have your attention, please. ...just face the camera. Now everybody a big smile... I've seen more life in a sick note! Come on, everybody! One, two... Mr. Williams... Mr. Williams! Bob, stop it! Mr. Williams... ...now face the camera, that's the idea... ...after three, a big smile... one... two... three... cheese! Mr. Williams? The day before He suffered... He took bread in his sacred hands... and looking up to Heaven, to you, His Almighty Father... He gave you thanks and praise. He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said... "Take this all of you and eat it... this is my body which will be given up for you. " When supper was ended He took the cup... again He gave you thanks and praise... gave the cup to His disciples and said... "take this all of you and drink from it... this is the cup of my blood... the blood of the new and everlasting covenant... it will be shed for you and for all men... so that sins maybe forgiven. " Yes? Hello, love. Does, er, Mr. Robert Williams live here? Yeah. But he's not here. Can you tell me when he may be back? Well, I don't know. He's gone to church. Why? Does he own a green Transit van... ...BRJ 563Y? Yeah, but it's been stolen. Well, we've found it. It's in the police pound at Collyhurst. I wonder if you'd give him a message, ask him to collect it. The body of Christ... Amen...
