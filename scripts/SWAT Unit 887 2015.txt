Yes, l promise. I will look through every single one, okay? Even the pinks. I said the pinks. Okay, I can't wait. Okay. Okay, love you. I love you, too. Bye. "I love you." Anyway, so how do you think we did today'? I think we did good, man. Yeah'? I think we kicked ass. Sorry about that. Is he there'? Hey. There's my girl. How are you'? Good. Mmm. Ooh, woo! Geez, Chris. What have you been feeding her'? Shut up. Come eat. What's up, buddy'? Sam, what's going on, man? Man, lam starving, brother. Tonight, on Crime Watch, the search for 19-year-old Janet Andrews has come to a happy end. Police raided a suspected base camp of human trafficking When was this'? Did you know about this'? Mm-mmm. Oh, my God. Hey, everybody, Sammy. Sammy is on TV. ...rescue of Janet Andrews and the other hostages. A shoot out occurred, which resulted in the deaths of three of the alleged kidnappers. Now, back to you at the studio. You can't play cowboys forever, you know. I'm not harping on you at all, but today you could have been killed. And you don't just have the two of us to worry about anymore. I took this job because I wanted to do something important. You know? I get it, though. I get it. I understand where you're coming from. We--we do have something important, though. I know. We've got a baby on the way. I know. And honestly, Chris, every single time you walk out that door, I worry. And every time that phone rings while you're on duty, it's ridiculous. I lose a year of my life. I'm going to be gray in, like, a year. Oh, my gosh, you are not going to be gray. And if you are gray, I will still love you, and we will buy you the best hair dye in the world. But I don't need to be gray. Listen to me. You need to be safe. Yes, I will, okay'? Every day I am safe. I came home tonight. I'm going to come home tomorrow night. And I'm going to come home every night for the rest of your life. You know why'? Because I love you.

Be ready for a briefing in 10 minutes. Ma'am. All right, everybody, listen up. We've got a situation. A tier 3 target was just identified arriving at LAX just a short while ago. One Damian White. White is an ex special military ops turned career criminal. He's managed to stay off the grid for the last seven years, so we're not exactly sure his reason for popping up again, but it can't be good. The last time, he managed to hijack a shipment of raw radioactive materials for the ecu-terrorism organization, the ELF. This character here is Nick Koslow. Okay, Koslow is White's right-hand man, his enforcer. You should all recognize these three clowns. Now let's see if we can't get some eyes on each one of them. See if we can't flush Damian out. Their roles as black market arms dealers makes them a likely first stop for Damian. If White is back out in the open, you can rest assured that these men are, too. Other than that, we are flying blind here. God knows I hate flying blind. All right, let's get as much information as possible, their local contacts, known associates, any gossip that might be brewing in the trenches. And I need it yesterday. Okay, connect with your contacts. Let's nail this bastard. You okay, ma'am'? We need to alert local authorities, and get the police captain on the phone. Yes, ma'am. - This is Uni! 887. - We have a report of a 273 Delta in progress just east of your position. Can you respond? Yeah, we're on the corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and Market. 10-4, in route. Oh, you fucking bitch. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy what'? Jimmy what'? Put the gun down, please. Listen, Jimmy. Shut up. Shut up. I don't understand why you're doing this. Shut up. I can't-- Shut up, shut up. Shut up. What is this'? What is this'? Mm-mmm. What is this'? Mm-mmm. Huh'? What is this'? My neighbors here, they're normally good people. Okay. Right'? And I just hear weird noises coming out of there. Listen to me, why don't you calm down'? You sure they're not just, you know, doing something? What kind of noises? Tell me. Tell me! Okay, I was just going to visit my mom for a little while, okay'? Don't fucking lie to me. I was just going to see her for the weekend. Who are you fucking'? Tell me! I'm not fucking anyone. Believe me. Who are you fucking'? Trust me, I'm not fucking anyone. Who are you fucking'? I'm not fucking anyone. Look at these lips. Look at these lips. Whose lips have you been kissing? Don't!

Stop it, stop it, please. watch movies and series Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Thank you. Hicks, what's your 20? Do not pursue the suspect. Wait for backup. I'm on the corner of 8th and 9th Street. We need backup. This is Officer Hicks. My partner is on his way. We have a man down. Suspect down. Report. I'm reporting live from downtown Los Angeles at a crime scene. Earlier today, a woman was found at her house tied up by her boyfriend. The man ran to avoid capture. An officer shot the man whose identity remains unknown. The woman was saved by Officer Cutter and Officer Hicks. Hicks and Cutter, get your asses in here. Sit down. That was some stunt you guys pulled. Chief wanted to come down on you guys very hard. Captain... Did I fell you to fucking talk? Then shut up. Don't think you're going to be cooling your heels and sipping Mai Tais waiting for the review board to go over that disaster yesterday. I'm putting yous on babysitting detail. Tonight, Senator James Abrahams is doing a big deal and he wants a couple cops to keep an eye on his VIPs. Since I don't want to break up this happy marriage, you're going to accompany him on his babysitting detail until the review board clears him for general duty. I understand, sir. I mean, I'm sure I could be used better on some other detail. Don't you think'? You know, you should have thought of that before you let your fucking partner play hero. Now, get the fuck out of here. Yes, sir. Hicks... You're not going to last in the PD if you don't learn to play by the rules. It's that simple. LAPD. Captain Ryan. One moment, please, while I transfer your call.

All right, let's get some people down there. I'm on it. Okay, you two are going to man the south wing checking the IDs. The Senator is going to be in the north wing with the main body. Why would he have us on the south end, and everyone else on the north end'? I mean, what's going on'? Because the Senator wants all his team on the north side. Why move all the gallery security to the perimeter? They know this place better than anyone. Because he doesn't want any problems. I guess there's a lot of bigwigs here tonight, huh? The senator rubs elbows with a whole bunch of high-profile people. He likes to make a big splash. Okay, sounds easy enough. Sounds like we're on grunt duty. We hit the south wing, stand still, watch stars, you guys get to have fun. Correct? It's going to be a good time. Just stay out of everybody's' way. This is going to be a walk in the park. Come an. Okay, I understand we're hereto work, not question. I get it. Take care of it. I'm going to go mingle. And don't cause any trouble. You see what you get us into'? There's no working as a team, huh? So why don't we go the rest of the night and you try not to fuck up, okay'? Just pay attention, man. Seriously, please. I got you, man. Please, please? Look at me. Can you pay attention?

Good, all right, also confirm that Claire Landis was on that guest list. I'll send a transfer for the asset, ma'am. Whoa, this is not our jurisdiction.

You're not going to let them die, are you, Christopher? Are you? Oh, so you think playing with peoples lives, that's a game? What do you want'? No! Hey. That's not how this game works. Okay? You don? ask me questions. I ask you questions. Okay, you have something that I very much want, like I said, and I have three fat cats and a little girl that would very much like to go home, okay'? I'm sure we can come to some-- some kind of agreement and arrangement. But only if you follow the rules. You have a pen? Because you might want to [at this dawn. One, absolutely no more press! What does that mean? You heard that, right'? Shh. I want it quiet. You hear that'? It's really quiet. I want it that quiet. Two, absolutely no feds. I don't want to wake up with some FBI drones kicking down my door. If that happens and they die just like your poor partner, okay'? Listen to me, you cock sucking motherfucker, I swear to God, when I find you lam going to kill you. You hear me'? Listen to me, asshole. Don't be rude. It's unnecessary. Three, I want a plane. I said I want a plane. A midsize, you know, a G6. No miles, full tank of gas. You know, the kind those Hollywood guys fly. Okay? And the last thing, I want $100 million. I said I want $100 million. want $100 million and a G6. What's wrong with that? Who wouldn't want that'? And you're going to give it to me, aren't you'? That's not too much to ask for, all things considered. Oh, and Christopher, I don't know if you remember, but I have four bartering chips, and every six hours that pass that I don't get what I want, I don't give a fuck what it is. I may improvise and say I want to get a blow job, and I don't get it, you will have killed one of these people. Okay? So... let's get the ball rolling, shall we'? Let's get the ball rolling, I said, shall we'? That's called a gun you just heard. Hey, I am a cold-blooded killer. It's what I do best. I kill people. Now I have three bartering chips. Don't forget about me. This salad sucks. Who made this shit'? Sorry, sir. It's all right. Don't be sorry, man. Just do. Is this a fucking joke? Shh! Cutter. Cutter! So what are you going to do about it'? Jesus Christ, Cutter. You stay put. We're coming to you. You better start talking right fucking now. You get the IT guys to trace that number. Right now, Cutter is the only solid lead we have. Now Kane, I need you to run point on this, and we got to move on this fast, my man. If I'm running point, I'm choosing my own team. They understand the importance of keeping things quiet. That is my team, sir. You got it. Get me personnel. Chris! They'll die just like your poor partner. They'll die just like your poor partner. You might want to jut this dawn. One... Two, absolutely no feds. I don? want to wake up with some FBI drones kicking down my door. That happens and they die just like your poor partner, okay? And lastly, I wan! $100 million. You're going to give it to me, aren't you? That's not too much to ask for, all things considered. Oh, and Christopher, I don't know if you remember, but I have four bartering chips. Every six hours that pass that I don't get what I want, I don? give a fuck what it is. I may improvise and say I want to get a blow job. and I dun '1 get it, you will have killed one of these people. Okay? So let's get the ball rolling, shall we? Let's get the ball rolling, I said, shall we? Where the fuck is the info on these hostages? Does he have any connection to Landis? We've got the basics, but nothing connecting him to the doctor, no. Give me what you've got. The first is Alan Brolin. CEO, Pharmatech. Billionaire, on a second marriage, two kids, no connection to Damian, and no criminal history. Next is Joel Fisher. He's one of our state representatives. Typical upper middle-class background, married, no kids. Got into some trouble in college, but nothing major. And the third is Jordan Lawrence. She's a state Superior Court judge and former national pageant winner. Squeaky clean. Keep digging. Having zero connection just doesn't make any sense. And what about Jenkins? Any further connection? Possibly, ma'am. I'll send our guys in to collect the asset. Stop the transport. Damian has got us by the balls on this one. We've got no choice but to play by his rules. Then let's get a hold of Captain Ryan, get him up to speed about Jenkins. Maybe we can do something with that. And for the love of fucking God, get Cutter back on the phone. I've never seen any of those men. I don't know who any of these people are. Well, they know who you are. Okay'? It may have been just a heist gone bad. It may be something else, but this is what I can tell you. They want you dead, they have your daughter, and there's a very real chance that this could go very bad. And do you hear me'? What I need you to do is be strong, listen to me, and you need to stay calm. Okay, you need to tell me everything that you know. This is Cutter. Cutter. You're on your own for the next few hours. I'm contacting your captain now. Letting him know that under no circumstances is anyone to meet Damian's demands. I understand. Hey, Don, you want to have some fun tonight, huh'? Hey, birdie. Hey, birdie. Hey, little bird. What were you doing taking me Yankee dollars, eh'? What are you doing taking me Yankee dollars? I seen it. You let that pecker get away.

So, what's going on that you needed all of us so urgently? I'm sure you all know about what happened last night at the Senator's gala. Well, there's more to it than you think. The people behind it were actually trying to kidnap a scientist. Dr. Landis, to be specific. So, what do we have to work with so far'? Not much. They threatened to kill a hostage every six hours unless we turn Landis over to them. That ain't going to happen. But we're taking it seriously. And remember, we do not negotiate with terrorists. Fisk, Aubrey, since you guys have worked undercover, there's got to be people you can tap for information. Get that information. Somebody knows something about where that heavy artillery came from. Copy that. Epps, you go with them. Lance, you're with me. You, Cutter, and I are going to go question Dr. Landis. We could use afresh pair of eyes. Let's move on this. Oh, fuck. Those fucking cameras. I'll willing to cooperate. I will do anything you want me to do. I'll tell you anything you want. Whoa! You done fucking around? It's just me. Put your fucking weapon down. Move your ass. We got work to do. Please, just let me out of here. I need to get my daughter. So, how is she doing? She seems to be holding up all right. She keeps talking about her kid. Anything else? Nope, just waiting on a background check. Not a word about what these guys might want with her'? No, sir, she says she has no idea what they could possibly want with her. Hey, flip to Channel 6. News Channel 4 has acquired exclusive security footage from the attack at Senator Abrahams' gala that left several dead and countless wounded. So now we bring you an inside look at the horrors that went on during the attack. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Jesus fucking Christ. So what does this mean for the other hostages? Nothing good. It's him. This is him. Record this, okay'? Track it. This is Cutter. Hey, guess who'? I assume you've seen the news. Huh'? What was my first rule, Christopher? Listen to me, don't do that, okay'? Look, just give us some more time. What was my first rule'? You don't need to hurt anyone, okay'? We didn'! break any of your stupid ass rules. We're just trying to get people home safe, okay? So, please... This is extremely disappointing. Extremely disappointing, because you're going to have to do better. Okay'? Look, what you're asking for is not that easy, okay'? If you give me a little more time, I can do this. Hey look, the rules were very clear. They were very clear. And this is no lane's fault... but yours. Now, who should be next'? Huh'? The butcher? The candlestick maker? Or Little Miss Muffet'? Huh'? Or you'? Nobody else has to die, okay'? Nobody has to die. Give me some more time. Christopher... you're a fuck up. Damian, please, give me some more time. We got a lock, sir. Kiss my ass. Hello, doctor. I'm Sergeant Kane. This is Officer Lance, and I know you've already met Officer Cutter. Nuclear or biological doctor'? What'? Your specialty, Doctor. Nuclear or biological? Hey, let me tell you something. I've done this long enough to know that when people with that kind of heavy artillery come after people like you, people with your pedigree, it's always about getting access to one of two things every single time. Nuclear or biological weapons. So which is it'? Biological. Okay. But I would never hurt anyone. I would never hurt a fly. So, who are they, and what exactly could it be they're after'? F don't know. What do you mean you don't know? What do you mean you don't know? You understand, somebody is going to die if you don't talk'? Please help us! Cutter, Cutter, I said that's enough. I don't care what you-- You don't care'? I said enough. Yeah, their deaths are on your head, okay? Help me find my daughter. Carrot? Aw, the man has got good eyes. Good for you. So my boys tell me you need to talk to me? Very convincingly, I hear. Sometimes you got to make an impression. Mm-hmm, yeah, you know, you can also try doing that with respect. Now, you'd better be talking about a lot of money or else I'm going to take care of all of these people. You got it'? Respect goes both ways. Now, money? I got that. But I'd rather not talk business with the help. Chill, I got this. All right, we can do this privately. Jesse, take them outside. Let's step into my office. So, what can I do you for'? Need a little info. Fancy shindig got hit last night. Big rm. Heavy artillery. You know anything about that'? Nah, I mean, I heard about it, but I know nothing. Hmm. So, where they get their firepower? It wasn't me. I ain't stupid. Ain't messing with crazy honkies, no mad scientists. Well, look, do me a solid. Matter of fact, you know what? I'll act like I didn't see this. You should give me a call if you hear something. I'll do that. Make sure you do that. Oh, hey, Fisk. Um, now don't forget. If your boys need anything... you know where to come. I'll remember that. You remember that. Kane, talk to me. Nice work. They were able to trace the call. Team is prepping to move into the location as we speak. So it's not about her daughter now. It was unavoidable. Listen, she's refusing to cooperate. She's pushing to go along with the team. You know it's obviously out of the question. Any leverage for her to talk, because you know we're going in blind. No, no, any leverage we might have had is gone. She has no other family. We weren't able to put a lock on the father. She's insisting we turn her over to them. Mike, an exchange is out of the question. Agreed. I hope you and Kane know what the hell you're doing, but I have a summit I need to prepare for tonight. I'm leaving this up to you. And Mike? Don't let me down, huh'? Okay. We just got word that the local PD has tracked Damian's phone and they're on route. Damian is too smart to be traced by a cell phone. He doesn't make mistakes like that. All boys in Bravo Team. Cover the rear and side entrances. Keeping anyone from leaving and covering our asses. Meanwhile, Team Alpha will infiltrate the main entrance. Hi. Good evening, ma'am. You seemed a little restless. When we're all set, Bravo will detonate smoke grenades, giving us cover on the inside. Oh, that coffee is good. Cheers. Cheers. Sorry I've been so upset today. Yeah, it's hard being locked in this room all day. I mean, you've been watching the cameras, right'? Yes, that is my job. Don't you go anywhere. Clear! Clear! Clear! Place is empty. We're too late. What the fuck are you doing? Son of a bitch. Hey, yeah, I just got away from the officer. I'm on my way to you. Let me speak to Mikayla. Goddamn, they played us. No one was ever here. They just dropped the body of the hostage off. The judge, f think. I know he's given you his list of demands. I've heard the tape, but with Damian it's never just about the money. In my experience, it's always something more complicated than that. He made sure to target the most high profile people at that event, guaranteeing we'd at least entertain his demands. I can only give you a few hours. Then I've got no choice but to move in. John, look at me. Are you okay'? John, what happened? She-she just-- Look, stop stuttering. Talk to me, okay'? What happened? How did she get out'? Where is she at'? I messed up, all right'? She got me. She came out of nowhere, and she clocked me with a freaking coffee pot. She's-- she's gone. How did she get a coffee pot'? I don't know. We were making coffee earlier. What is wrong with you'? I didn't see her. She came out of nowhere. She took off. How did she get out of the room'? I don't know, no one was watching the room. She just came out. No one was watching the room'? No one was watch-- Do you hear yourself? I messed up. I'm sorry. We'll find her. We'll find her. Goddammit! Ugh! Son of a bitch. We got played. Cutter. Sir, listen to me. Dr. Landis knocked John out. She took his car. I believe she's going to Damian. Give me the phone. Cutter, there's only two hostages left. That means there's 12 hours and no bargaining chip. Let's move it, okay'? Pick up, pick up. Listen to me. Something is not right. Some {hing hasn't seemed right. Think about it, okay'? If they took the hostages' phones, how did Dr. Landis get a phone? They took them all. They put them in a bag. So, why did Dr. Landis have a phone? Cutter, I've got no choice but to move in. This is Cutter. Did you find my little package? All wrapped up neatly with a bow'? Yeah, I got your package, and I'm going to be seeing you really soon. You should know by now I wouldn't make it that easy for you. Listen to me, you sick fuck. Tick took, tick took, tick took, Christopher. Asshole. We are tracing the LoJack system on John's car right now as we speak. We should have a lock anytime. So get backup ready, get everybody ready, and meet me at the location. Hey. Ready to go'? Yes, sir. Come on, let's get it together so we can catch our plane. Let's go, move. Hurry. Yes, sir. Be cool. Were you followed? Huh'? No, I made sure of that. Yeah? Listen to me. I don't want no trouble from you. All right'? You so much as breathe a word I don't like, boom. Please, just let me see my daughter. Please, just let me see my daughter. We are a go to move in on the target. Location is three blocks south of Main Street. I repeat, all units be advised. We are a go to move in on the target. Location is three blocks south of Main Street. This is Special Agent Melanie Hamlin. Badge number Alpha Delta 0735441. I'm requesting immediate air support. Tier 3 target's name is Damian White. Be advised that local PD is already en route. Copy that. Send all available units. Lance, look, when we land, get to higher ground. Got it'? Get me that security footage. Son of a bitch. The video was never about the fucking demands. Stop, stop, stop, fuck. It's okay. Goddammit. Here. Come on, Lance. Stay back here and provide cover. Copy that, sir. These motherfuckers got a sniper. We need to get everyone out of City Hall. Now. A bio-weapon'? Holy shit. Come on, Lance, goddammit, come on. Now! Move, move, move. Nick! Come on, let's go! Let's go. I'm on it. Move! Keep running! We need to get that hostage. We're fucked. Got it'? Copy that. Let's go. Lance, you see that shut, you take it, copy. Cutter, I'm hit. He shot my scope. How you doing? They're upstairs. All right, I got your lead. Let me lead. I'll protect you. That's cute. I got you. Let's go. Any sign of Landis? Sir! Sir, are you okay'? Don't ever ask me that again. Go. Move. Exactly what kind of weapon are you talking about? I'm pulling up the schematics now and sending them over to you. I got 100 plus people in this building. That's not enough time to clear them to a safe perimeter. Guy was thick. Move! I want to thank you for being here, and I know exactly what you need to do. So, make the right choice. Can you pass these over, please? Nick, Nick! Put the fucking gun on the ground right now. Want to ask if one wasn't enough? Please give me a reason to fucking kill you. Kane to Cutter, Damian is on the roof. Do you copy? I'll handle this. Go get Damian. Ready for this, big boy'? All right. I haven't had my workout today. Huh. I'll advise you. Okay. Got to cheat, huh'? It ain't cheating. It's fucked, bitch. Yeah! Woo! Yeah! Who's the bitch now'? Kane to One, I've located the Senator. Ladies and gentlemen, I need your attention. I need you to evacuate the building immediately. This is not a drill. There's a bomb in the building. Please do not panic. Just exit as quickly as possible. Let's go, let's go, all of you, please. Out of the building. Right away. What the fuck is going on, Mike? What the fuck is the matter with you'? We've got to evacuate the building. Dr. Landis planted a bio-weapon in here, and it's going to detonate in six minutes. Do you understand me'? Look, look for the fucking bomb or get out. What'? Find weapon? I thought your team had did a thorough sweep of the building. Would you shut up'? Obviously not thorough enough. Now, get those people out of here. Call a hazmat unit, and have them set up a perimeter. Senator, please just get the fuck out of the building. Go, go! There's a bomb in here. Your ass! Get out! Your ass! My ass. This has got to be it. Hey! Put your gun on the ground now. Motherfucker, I'm going to kill you. Fuck you. Dammit, why can't they just label this stuff'? It would make it a lot easier. All right, here we go. All right, I'm doing it. Here we go. I did it. I did it. I did shit my pants but I did it. I did it. I shit my pants. It is never easy to say goodbye to a fellow officer, especially someone I will call a brother. I met Sam during our training and watched him grow info an incredible officer. His courage and his strength are not to be forgotten. Sam, we will never forget you. And we will never forget the sacrifice you made for this city and her people. God bless your soul and I know I'll see you soon one day again, brother. Have a beer. You did good, kid. Like, I couldn't have done this without you. If there's anything you need at all, we're here for you, okay'? Take care, buddy. Yes, sir. Hey, baby, I'm just going to grab her some tissue. She's not doing so good. Okay. Be right back, okay'? All right. You okay, Ms. Hicks? I'll make it. You sure'? Thank you. Come here. Why don't you come have a seat, okay'? Get off your feet. It will do you some good, okay'? ...a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles. According to a source inside the LAPD, the warehouse was one of White's many safehouses scattered throughout the city. Authorities were hoping the raid would lead to the recovery of Dr. Claire Landis and her daughter Mikayla, bath of whom disappeared from the Senator's gala last week. Unfortunately, the two remain missing. If you have any information regarding their whereabouts, please dial the number listed at the top of your screen. Hello? Christopher. What's the significance of the place we hit? They're voting to shutdown my research. What the hell they have you doing out there, huh'? Oh, you don't want to know. Believe me. Oh, I do too. Is everything in order here? Such a good performance. You almost had me worried that somebody actually kidnapped my precious little girl. Are you up for little game'?
