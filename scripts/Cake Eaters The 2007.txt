Georgia, please try and hold still, honey. Great. Hold that. Hold that. Morning, Marg. - Hey, Judd. Georgia's just getting dressed. They got child pornography laws in this state, you know. Damn it, she's just trying to bring awareness to the disease. Oh, hell. She's trying to make a name for herself, and you know it. All right. Here, I can do it. - No. Georgia, please, just be patient, okay? I don't... There's my angel. Hey, Nana. Okay. Come on. It's all right. I'll get the wheelchair. Mom, no. Now, are you sure? She's sure. Here. There you go. Don't forget to take your pills after lunch. And don't feed them to Kelsey anymore. You'll... kill that poor dog. Go back here? Yeah, all the way down on the end. Hey. I don't even know how to price these, Dad. I don't know what they're worth. You got me. How's about we just ask them, let them tell us what they want to pay? Check this out. Yo, how much for the porn? $40. Each? What, are you kidding me? That's a fucking rip-off. Yo, that's her. Yo, check out this... oh, for real, man. Yo, yo, check this one out. Yo, do you have, like, a website or something like that? Okay. - Seriously, I'll check... get the hell out of here. What? We're talking. - Right now. Right here, gentlemen. Out! Hey, Bud! - Bitch. Now. Gone. - Who's this guy? What did you say? Nothing. - No, what did you say? I am not saying anything, man. Dude, forget it, man. Let's just go. I don't think they're teaching manners anymore at the schools. I guess not. So... how's business? Pretty slow. Now, what are you doing here, easy? We was just, um... getting rid of stuff we don't need anymore. Georgia, you must know Mr. Kimbrough. He's the butcher. I'm a vegetarian. We like that. This is my granddaughter, Georgia. I see that. A granddaughter indeed. And the hoverer, my son Dwight. And with his permission, you can call him Beagle. Hi. - Hey. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Uh, I've seen you around. You, uh... you go to my school. You go to Lincoln? No, no. I, uh... I work there in the cafeteria. I make your lunch. If you want to call it lunch. Yeah, well, school food gets a bad rap, I guess. Hey, easy. Dad. Could you keep an eye on my booth for just a minute while we take a little trip to the ladies' room? Not at all, ma'am. - Thank you. Actually, I'll volunteer Beagle here to help you. Beagle? - Yeah. Oh, okay. - Yes. Sure, sure. Thank you. Just careful. Okay. I got ya. - Okay. What's with the women's clothes? Oh, they're my mom's. Where is she? Uh... she's not, uh... she's just, uh... What? She died. Oh. If you don't mind my asking, who took those pictures? My mom. Really? She's applying for a Guggenheim. Oh, yeah? What's that? Like, a grant. Ah. Well, I liked them. Okay. Here I am. Well... yeah, I probably shouldn't go into the... I'll take that. Thank you. - You're welcome. Come on, girl. Come on. If you don't mind, we'll be just a minute. All right. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Sure. I'll just wait out here for you guys. All right. You should come over tonight. Why? Thanks for waiting. Here we are. Oh! - Yeah. Oh, damn. It looks like rain. Lord, I swear the only time this happens is when I put the top down. Will you all excuse me? I'm just gonna run on and get it. Yeah, okay. - Here we go. I just need help with my homework. M-my hands get really tired if I write for too long, so I get people to help me. Otherwise, I wouldn't ask, you know? So what's wrong with you anyway? I have Friedreich's Ataxia, a neuromuscular disease. Is that why you talk kind of like you're drunk? I do? - I mean... no, it's... I just... it's slurred a little. Oh, I get it all the time. I-I just didn't know what the... I didn't know anything about it. I didn't mean to offend you or anything. No, you didn't. It's... a genetic defect of some kind. Are you gonna get better? No. This is pretty much as good as it's gonna get until my heart gives out. I wonder when that's gonna be. Look, you don't have to come over if you don't want. I just... - no, no. I want... I want to come over. Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Cool. Beagle! Let's go! Get it in gear! What is he doing? You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. All right. I'll see you later. Jeez. The hell is that? Who is that? Is that... I'll be goddamned. What the hell are you doing up there? I didn't get the mail till this morning. I would have been here. I-I've been on the road. I know. There's a hole in Mom's sewing room. I know. What happened? I had to put her in the hospital. Diabetes got real bad. She wasn't walking. High blood sugars, bedsores. Had a heart attack a week later. It was a real simple ceremony. You know, we tried to call you in New York. Your number didn't work. Couldn't get ahold of you, so... I'm sorry, Bud. It's been a long time. You got a girl down there in New York? I haven't been in one place long enough, Dad. How about this, three bachelors under the same roof? You don't have a girl yet, Beag? Please. You still dip? God, that used to drive his mom nuts. You remember that? You're never gonna get a girl unless you quit that dip, Beagle. Did I ask your opinion? Lighten up. Here, I thought you might like to hear the new tunes. Hey, thank you. Wow. God damn it, it's good to have you back. Your mother would be so proud of you. Your food's getting cold, Dad. Big stuff, kid. The first round's on the geezer. No, no, Dad, it's my treat. I'll get it. Really? Yeah. Three ginnies. I haven't seen you since battle of the bands. Mike. How you doing? How 'bout you? W-what are you doing? Restoring old trucks with my uncle. Making bank on ebay. Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Nice. You good here? This is... - yeah, I'm good. All right. What are we, elephants? To coming home. What's going on, ladies? How you doing? Ladies, what'll you have? I got to pee. yeah? Hey. It's okay. Do you want to shoot some pool, Dad? No, thanks. Why don't I play some music? Make it music. Hey, guy. # I heard your mockingbird don't sing # Stacy. I thought you were in New York. I was. Yeah. How'd it go down there? Ah, it went, uh, pretty fast and pretty slow. Right. Stacy, you seen, um... uh, Stephanie lately? Sure. She cuts my hair. Ah, come on. # Happening # # it doesn't seem you want to be my friend # # why don't you open up and let me in right now? # # all for the best # # I'm just doing my best # # and I don't know what I'm doing it for # # I will knock on your door # Where's brother? Mm-mm. Steph. You scared the shit out of me. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. What are you doing here? Huh? Aren't you gonna ask me in? No. Why not? Because I don't want to. You're my friend. - No, no. No, you don't get to f... I want to be with you. You don't get to just say that to me after three years. I know that I fucked up. You asked me to marry you. - And I meant it. And then you took off without even saying good-bye. I'm here now. I'm... good for you. Okay, now, honey, imagine the organs in your body floating in the different colors I project on you, okay? Green is the alchemy of consciousness, with its spiraling energy and DNA. Purple opens the body's energies. Yellow strengthens the nerves and the brain. It's a little bright, Mom. It has to be to have healing energy. Silver removes diseases. Beagle. Shit. Wh... Hi. Are you expecting someone? I'm sorry. I tried the front door. Come in. Your name is Beagle? Yeah. Judd. - Hey, nice to meet you. Yeah. Hi. Uh, Georgia asked me to come over and take dictation for her. I'm a little bit late, though. Well, um, we're in the middle of a treatment, so... oh. We're just finishing up, though. It's okay. But gold is the most important one. There's no point in doing it if you skip the gold. Mom, it's getting late. I got to get my homework done. Hey. You don't go to Lincoln, do you? Uh, no. I work there. Well, we've met all of Georgia's teachers. We've never met you before. Yeah, I'm not a... I-I'm more like a temp. Oh. What subject? Well, what difference does it make? It's dictation. Come on. Beagle, why don't you help? We'll be right down here if you need us. I got it. There you go. Close the door. Okay. Cool room. Thanks. Come here. Okay. Is that your, uh, homework? Yeah. Okay, just read it. Okay. "What American poet wrote, 'hope is not found in a way out but a way through'?" Robert Frost. Just write it right there? "What poet wrote, 'hope is thing with feathers. "'It perches in the soul "'and sings the tune without the words and never stops at all'?" Emily Dickinson. "What famous poem did Welsh writer Dylan Thomas pen?" Do not go gentle into that good night. Okay. What? You can kiss me if you want to. Okay. Felt. Gonna have to start looking sharp. Nobody made any money today, so let's just take a second look. Aha. Whoa. What's up? Oh, what the hell? Coming, coming. Why, easy. What a surprise. Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Mmm. You started without me. Hey, there's always something to celebrate in my family. How about celebrating this in there? Let's go. - Ooh, ooh. Straight ahead, now. - Mmm. You want to be helpful? - Mm. Slice up a couple of these onions here. Sir, yes, sir. Ooh-ooh. Can we have some of those twice-baked potatoes? Really? - Mm. You want to wait that long for them to bake... twice? Once is fine. Twice might kill me. I don't think so. Hey, ease. - Hmm? I want to ask you something. Did you notice anything funny about the way your son was looking at my Georgia today? Beagle? No, ma'am. That's just Beagle. He's got absolutely no game in that area, trust me. Georgia. It's time for your friend to go home. Oh, shit. Come back tomorrow. Yeah? Yeah, we can go somewhere. Okay. Honey, wrap it up. I'll see you tomorrow. - Great. Bye. Now, I'll be sure and call the school on Monday and let them know what a hardworking teacher they have that comes to his student's house on a Saturday night when he could be out with some friends his own age. Okay, bye. Good night. Hey. Morning, Buddy. Morning. # The world's locked up in your head # # you've been pouring it a concrete bed # # your habits ossify # # you don't realize you're fried # # to find someone you love # # you got to be someone you love # # to find someone you love # # you got to be someone you love # What do I smell? I smell eggs. Eggies! Eggs, my favorite thing. And you know what? You know this man right here, he will not allow me to eat one egg. It's because you're supposed to be watching your cholesterol. To cholesterol. What have I got this morning? My two boys in the same room with me. I'm eating eggs, Bud. You gonna be able to stick around for a while? Yeah. I-I-I don't know. I, um... I'm kind of in between gigs. Music thing's not really working out. Didn't you just tell us that you made a record? And we still got to pay for it. I think we sold, like, 13 copies, Come on, you could... I'm thinking about bartending again, I guess. You... you can always help out in the shop. Right. Oh, no. I don't believe it. - What's wrong? No, I don't... oh, my God. What? "Dear Miss Kaminski, "we would be delighted to publish your continued work "on the Georgia still life series, "and you have been chosen as the aperture foundation portfolio pick." That's me. Are you serious? - Yes. That's incredible, baby. That's what you wanted. Yes, it is. - Good. Congratulations. You hear that, Georgia? That's awesome, Mom. It is, isn't it? Oh, baby, just think. Someday your images are gonna be hanging up next to Sally Mann. No, your image is. No, god gave me such a beautiful daughter, and I want to show the world how special you are. Mama, do I have to do this today? I just really don't feel like it. Why not? I love your photos. It's not that. I just... well, let's just get you into this and take some... baby, she don't want to do it. Well, how do you know that? Okay, who's up for a day of beauty? I'm gonna go. - Where are you going? Nana's taking me to get my hair cut. Jesus! Georgia. Are you okay? You all right? I got you. You know what? You're not going anywhere without your wheelchair. Mom, I don't need it yet. Georgia, you're covered in bruises. I know that. I'm the one who's dying, remember? It's not you. What did you say? I just don't need you reminding me all the time. Well, I just... how did I get to be the bad guy? What are you thinking about, my angel? Sex. Whoa. It's, like, this huge deal, right? Uh-huh. I mean, but is it really? No, it can be very beautiful, and it can be very not beautiful. How old were you when you first... when you lost it? Georgia, where's this going? I-I mean, I was 17 or... Okay, I was 15, and it was in an alley behind my parents' house in Upper St. Claire with a boy named Johnny Yusef. He was Russian, very handsome. I was drunk, so I don't remember a whole lot about it. In case you're getting any ideas, I suggest just... wipe them from your mind. Sugar, we don't have such great luck in this family. Hey. Hey, there, pork chop, breakfast for you. Hey, gorgeous. Here we go. There we go. Would it be okay if I just pop out for a few minutes, have a smoke, walk? You okay? - Yeah. All right. Well... all right. So what are we gonna do today, hmm? Trim the ends, keep the length? I want something radical, sexy. Well, I can do radical sexy. What's the special occasion? I have a date. You have a date? Sweetie, that is so great. Is he cute? Yeah. He's interesting. Interesting, ooh. Is it love? I'm not really looking to fall in love right now. Well, why not? There's nothing like your first love. Trust me. I just want to see what it's like. What... uh, what are we talking about here? I want to lose it. You want to lose... it? Honey, that... uh, that's... that is something serious, you know? I mean, you only get one chance for your first time. It should be with someone you're crazy in love with, you know, 'cause you're gonna remember it the rest of your life. You should wait. I don't really have a lot of time to wait. Easy, someone's here to see you. Well, how about this for a surprise, huh? You know what you can do for me, Vito? What? I'll take care of Miss Kaminski. Why don't you run across the street and get us a couple subs before they close? But I ate. So wh... yeah, well, I could use some subs. Okay. You got it? All right. You sure you don't want to wait inside? Yeah, I'll just... all right, we're here. You got it? All right. Listen, I'm the queen of stupid, so one word: protection. All right? You're gorgeous. I'm a genius. What? I j... You hungry? Oh, man. You are a pain. Doesn't anybody else feed you? I'll get you something. Well, some things just get better with age, and you're one of 'em. Mm. Well, hello, rock star. You like it? Your mama's gonna kill me. # Let me show you # Hello. # that deep look in your eye # # makes me want to be # # always by your side # I haven't been in here in a while. It's... still got the... the bunk beds. That's sweet. What's that? Oh, this is, uh... it's your vinyl. You didn't have to do that. Yeah, I did. I mean, I had to do something with it, so... I couldn't sell it. Thanks. This is so weird. You drink bourbon now? Got to do something. Isn't that kind of a grown-up drink? Hey. - I'm not... I wasn't gonna drink it. Look at those new tattoos. Look at me. Steph. If you want me to leave you alone, you just tell me, okay? I'm sorry. - I know. I know. # I got a feeling something's headed my way # # I don't know when it'll get here # # or how long it will stay # # so I'll wait forever # # for somebody to find me here # # soon we'll be together # # I've been alone for all these years # Beagle. Hey, uh, he's not here, Dad. What? What do you mean, he's not here? I don't know. He was supposed to help me this afternoon. I'll come with you. Put a shirt on. Where are we going, Dad? She's something special, isn't she? Yeah. She won the blue ribbon two years running at the 4-H. Couldn't afford to hang on to the place, so... I guess we're gonna eat her. # soon we'll be together # # soon we'll be together # # Soon we'll be together # # I've been alone for all these years # They're not always this cute. Don't look at me. I'm not gonna kill her. Where the hell have you been? What have you got on? Loafers? You don't slaughter animals in loafers, for christ's sake. Here. Did you forget you told me you were gonna help me today? Hey, Dad. I saw you. What? I saw you. Saw me what? With Georgia's grandmother in the shop. I saw you. Yeah, she's there a lot. - She's there a lot. You screw her a lot? That isn't what you think it is. Mom's been dead for a month! I know how long she's been dead, for christ's sakes. What did you do? Did you... you... you pick this lady up on the way home from Mom's funeral? Just tell him, Dad. Tell me what? He's been seeing her for years. Well, then... that's great. I never, ever would have left your mother. Things happen, and things change. So, uh... all this time that I was, uh, cleaning up mom's piss and filling out those HMO forms because you "couldn't stand to see her like that," you were off fucking that old whore. Hey! - Do I have that right, Dad? Leave him alone. Hey! Hey! - Lay off him. Guy, I don't want to hear it! What? What the hell did I do, huh? Nothing. You did nothing. You knew about this? You didn't do anything? What did you want me to do? Oh, you fucking... You left her here to die. Now, what was so important that you couldn't show up not once in three years? Dad! Hey, Georgia, I didn't hear you come in. Oh. Good god almighty, look at you. You look good. It's crazy, right? - Yeah, I like it, though. You look good. - Thanks. Wow. Where's Mom? She's upstairs taking a nap. Is she okay? Okay? She's a little wound up. Yeah, I know. But she does the best she can. You know your mama. Georgia, honey. Holy shit. Georgia. Georgia, what the hell did you do? What... what did you do with your hair? I cut it. Uh, yeah, I can see that. And Marg let you? It's my hair. And I... and where do you think you're going right now? I have a date tonight. A date? Beagle is picking me up. Uh, no. No, no, no, no. Absolutely not. - Why not? Well, for starters, he's too old for you. He's a teacher at your school. Actually, he just works in the lunchroom. Oh, so you lied to me? He's really nice, Mom. I'm sure he's nice. He wants to get into your pants. You so do not get this. No, I get it. Believe me. Georgia, I get it. I'm going. Let me. Fine, Georgia, I'm not gonna stop you. Fine. But you be back by 10:00, or I'm calling the cops. Georgia, you need a ride home, you let me know, okay? Just step up on that. Okay. Good? That's for you. Be right back. You can hang on to that. Beagle. Anything happen to that girl, I'm gonna kill you. Okay. All right, hold on to my waist. What'd you do to your hair? You don't like it? - No, I love it. So where we going? Green Lake Resort. # hey, maybe the time just wasn't right # I don't know what to do. Do y... Beagle did this. He did? It's not bad. # Hey, when are you gonna stand # # and stop looking over your shoulder # # me with a head full of words # # and not one useful expression # # hey # # let go # # we with holes in our hearts # # were whole at the start # # our story began # # we film ourselves to the end # # try to suspend # # our lives in the dark # # hey, when are you gonna stand # # and stop looking over your shoulder # # see, there's a sun in the sky # # and a moon that will take us till morning # Hey, this is... this looks right. All right. Always smells like smoke in the old smoking rooms. Do you smoke? No. Do you? - No. I kind of want to. Want to sit down? Well, hello, handsome. What brings you by? Well... I, um... uh. Oh. - Bottoms up. Mmm. I can't do this anymore. Do what? This. Sneaking around. I can't lie to my boys anymore either. Easy, a man's got a right to his privacy. Here. I love you. Honey, I love you too. No. I love you big-time. You've always been my dream girl. You've just been out of reach. I-I don't want you to be out of reach anymore. I want you to do something for me. What? Marry me. Oh, I should get it. Hello. Mom, listen. Georgia's gone. I just... I let her get on the back of a motorcycle with some guy on some date, and I don't know where they're going; I don't know... Honey, you did exactly the same thing when you were her age. But, Mom, she's only 15. I don't know what to do. Okay. Now, who's the boy? No, he's not a boy. He's a... he's... he's 20. His name... it was a dog name. Beagle. - Beagle? Mom, I don't know what... should I call the police or... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Don't call the police. I think I know how to find her now. I'll call you as soon as I know something. You stay there in case she comes home. And, sugar, just try to calm down. Well, I don't think that's gonna happen, but okay. Oh. - What's going on? Oh-ho. Oh, g... Your white trash, low-life son has kidnapped my Georgia. Oh, come on. Beagle? - Yes, Beagle. He took her from her mother's house without asking. Took her... - Oh, come on. No, no... on a motorcycle somewhere, God knows where. Come on. He wouldn't do anything wrong. He's a good boy. He's not a boy. He is a man. And he is not good enough for my granddaughter. Something kind of smells like a farm. Oh, um, yeah, that's me, I think. Um, do you want to maybe take a shower first? Yeah. Okay. - Okay. I take a pretty quick shower. I'll just be a minute. Okay. Hey, Red. - Yeah. Have you seen a disabled girl, real pretty... with a man on a motorcycle? Nah. - Nothing? Thank you. - No problem. It's a scooter, babe. Offering our easy pay plan on this item.

Look, I don't care if you like me or not. I just want to get this over with. Don't you think... don't you think this is a little bit fast? I mean... look... Georgia? Just leave. What? Why don't we both just go, then? What... what if I just got us something to eat, and we could hang out in here and watch TV together and... Just leave! No. Damn it. Are you okay? - Yeah. What? Right there. Oh, my God. Hey. What? Don't you remember this place? Oh. Okay. Right, they had vibrating beds. God. They certainly did. That had to be 1986? I j... I don't know.

I couldn't even be in the same... room with her those last few days, couldn't stand to be in the same room with her. Beagle was there. Beagle was there every single day. He did something I could... never do. He was with her when she went out. I couldn't do that. Easy, losing people is lousy. Beagle... Beagle, he's a hell of a man. He's one hell of a man. Tell you what. Why don't we just wait out here for a while, huh? Back up the car. Violet, it's me. - Did you find her? Yes, and she's fine, and she's going to spend the night. Well, I just... I don't... know what to do with her anymore. They don't come with an owner's manual, do they? You're doing fine. You think so? Well... She's amazing. She must get it from somewhere. Okay. Good night. Bye. I'm sorry. Beagle. Hey, we got to go to school. Oh. Okay. Do you mind turning around while I change? Oh. Yeah. Of course. # I wouldn't mind # # If every day # # was like the day # # I had just yesterday # # you and I # # hanging on every kiss # # on all of this # # I wouldn't mind # # if all of my nights # # were like the nights # # You held me so tight # # your lips so close, so close # # on the back of my neck # # little sounds, little breaths # # but these times # # they just won't stand still # # they slip away # # and haunt me until the next time # # you take me in, take me in again # # and let me begin # # I wouldn't mind... # so I guess I'll see you at lunch.
