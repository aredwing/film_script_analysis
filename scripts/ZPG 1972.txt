Body temperature Except when illness strikes. Ah, they're design to go throughed. The whole range of childhood diseases. Nothing serious, Just enough to keep mother Constantly on her toes. She's darling. Don't you have a younger one? Sorry, we're... We" 're out of infants. They just can't make them fast enough, And trade-Ins have been sluggish. Some mothers can't stand To see their little ones grow up. Come on, lady. Make up your mind. We've been waiting here all day. Well, we'll take her. Do you have a name for her? We need a name so we can program her. Bonnie, after my mother.

I wonder what the hamburger Monte Christo Would taste like? Same as the spaghetti bolognese. Maybe we should have the beef stroganoff... a la old Vienna. Transgressors reported in sector 15. Transgressor's reported in sector 15. No, please, you've got to believe me. He's not a baby. He's just small for his age. She's lying. He ain't all right. He's eight. He's small for his age. Come here, boy. Come here. He doesn't look eight. He is eight. He's just small for his age. She's lying! Oh, please, don't hurt him. Oh, please, please. It's a fake. You can't fake this, lady.

For survival of the fittest, Man must be fit to pass, And for the amusement of your young ones, Cartoons will be shown at 5 p.m. For those junior citizens On the 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. rotation, These cartoons can be seen Before they tune in to their video study counselors. For the more athletic among you, The minister for sport And the council for citizens' entertainment... you may remove your atmospheric shield As the museum has made every effort... only a few ahead of us, mummy. We're getting there. How long did you have to wait? Four years... four years for just one hour. Welcome to state museum number 43. Hey, there's a line here, mister. Stay in line. Stay in line, please. Allow the museum personnel to pass through. Next couple. Time for us now. Come on. Although we know you will find all of the exhibits fascinating, May we request that you make your three selections At the central desk and keep moving. Others are waiting in line To share your happiest bliss. The flora and fauna on show here Are either the result of a ceaseless search on your behalf Or have been artificially cultivated on the premises By members of our laboratory staff. Almost all of the species have been extinct Since the end of the 20th century. Many of the fascinating replicas of marine and animal life May appear frightening to children, But we assure each parent there is no cause for alarm. In fact, many of these animals, Although totally unproductive, Were kept as domestic pets and bought as playmates For 20th century children. These animals contributed nothing, Were not a source of food. Our museum houses the largest selection of flowers On this continent. These aesthetic objects have been hydroponically cultivated, And hence it's been impossible To recreate their former aromatic properties. These flowers, pleasing to the eye as they are... get out of there. Come on. Get out of there. I am now going to take this gasoline pump And pour gasoline into this car, Which is also from the 1970s, And that's all there was to it. Sweet substances caused grave disorders of the teeth, And remedial surgery had to be conducted with primitive instruments. These surgeons were called dentists. However, the true cause Of our present atmospheric conditions Was the unrealistic and inept policies Of the leaders of industry. The crimes committed by them Were further perpetuated by the political and religious leaders Who irresponsibility allowed the equally devastating crime Of overpopulation. Time... The time is 13:55. Will all museum officials Report to their designated posts. And humanity suffered the great famine And the smog blanket age. Outside and to the rear of the museum You may visit our 20th century life exhibition. This is comprised of a street of seven houses, Any one of which is a perfect replica Of the domicile of the 20th century family. Each home is fully equipped With all the household gadgets Which have been obsolete... Who's with who tonight? Well, if you want to go with carol, I think she's coming down with a cold. She must have got it from me. I cured mine with a big dose of aspirin. There ought to be a law against free-Breeding germs. I think I'd better sleep alone tonight. Why did you lie to George? Why did you play along? I don't know. Why lie? Well, I don't know. Edna's behaving like a bitch for the last couple of days. Besides, you might be coming down with something. Who says? I say. Thank you. Delicious. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Well, that's our 1971 exhibition for today. Hope you enjoyed yourselves And saw some interesting things. Now Russ and George will take you to the pond pavilion Where you'll see some bodies of water That were known as lakes and ponds. Some contained edible fish now extinct. As you know, during the spatial crisis, These bodies of water were filled in To make room for housing. Oh, good evening, Mrs. McNeil. Good evening. Is Dr. Mallory in? Yes, doctor's in his office.

Doctor, I went to the baby shop today, And I just couldn't go through with it. Go on. Well... also... I find it very difficult... to make love. Have you used the audio-Visual erotica? Yes, but it just doesn't seem. To stimulate me. That's unusual, carol. Most women find it helpful. I know. Doctor, I just can't bring myself To believe all this. I just don't understand myself. I know I'm very lucky really. I have a much freer life And unusual space And oxygen privileges And better rations And even a vegetable garden, but... Lots of women would like to be in your place, carol. I know. I know. Doctor, I... Go on, carol. Go on, carol. Go on, carol. Doctor, I want to have a baby... my baby. That's impossible, carol. I know, but I want my own baby. You know that's impossible, carol. No one is allowed to have a baby For the next 22 years. I know, but I want one. That is not reality, carol. Your life is reality. You must learn to understand and accept it. It is as it is, And it will be until the day you die. That is the only reality. The only reality, carol. The only reality. Welcome to twilight city, Northeast division, sunset sector. The society wishes to express Its sincere and extreme pleasure At your visit.

Here is an announcement From the council for citizens' entertainment. The council for citizens' entertainment Wishes to announce That all those who have tickets For this evening's athletic event Report to the mass participation section Of your cinema. For survival of the fittest, Man must be fit to survive. The council for cultural education Is presenting the metropolis... Irrespective of nutritive value, Food was absorbed in huge quantities. Specific times of the day Were set aside for the intake of this food, And the replenishment of corporal energy Was sometimes turned into a social event. These events were even conducted out of doors Without any precautions taken To shield their activities. Although it seems ridiculous to us, Provided as we are by the society With a calorically calculated balanced diet, These people were almost criminally addicted To food. These 20th-Century specimens Took food for granted And ate indiscriminately, Although during those times, Half the world population was underfed. It appears barbarous to us, But until the end of the 20th century, Food was served on open plates. Meat was allowed, even encouraged, To be hung until it began to rot. Makes you shudder, doesn't it? Cheese was not considered a great delicacy Unless a crust of mold had formed around it. Not unexpectedly, these eating habits Contributed greatly To the general degeneracy of 20th-Century man. His health was poor... Disorders of the stomach, And can you wonder at it? Obesity, cardiac strain, thrombosis... All the conditions arrested, Corrected, and finally abolished By the society's rigorous and protracted efforts On your behalf. If these people seem happy to you, It can only be because they considered ignorance To be bliss. They allowed their addiction every license, Swallowed poisons without a care for the morrow Or their fellow man. Initiates of this eating cult Made great play Of the trappings you have just seen. Plates were decorated, painted, and sometimes gilded. Eating utensils were often of silver And used time and again Without the sterilization which you take for granted now. He's sick. Turn down the lights. Uh... put the child on the table. He has a terrible fever. Nothing to worry about. Huh. Fine, fine. Strong, healthy boy. Don't be afraid, carol. I won't tell anyone. Believe me. I won't tell anyone. Please trust me. I just want to look at him... Just a little look. A boy? Please... may I touch him? May I? Please, carol. Oh! Ooh! He's so... he's so soft, So little. Oh! Mummy. Oh, mummy. Here they come. Isn't he... Isn't he lovely, George? Were you there? Yes. Do you... feed him? You two have done a hell of a thing here. Uh... tell them, George. Well, look, Russ, uh... we're friends, and, uh, Edna and I had a talk last night. I mean, we really had a talk, And we decided that, uh, Well, that we're all in this together, you know? Well, like I said, we had a talk, you see, And, uh, we... We would like to, um, Kind of be... part of the family, you know? That wouldn't be possible, George. No. Just part of a big family. You understand? Look after the baby sometimes. We just want to share it with you, that's all. I could help you change the diapers or anything. Look, Russ. We're friends. We... We live next door to each other. We... We come in and out of here all the time. All we want to do is come over more often Just to see the baby, not to interfere. We just want to see the baby. We could just be... is that... look after it. Is that asking too much? Please, carol. I'd like to hold the baby. No. Why not? Why won't you let... Why won't you let us hold the baby? We'd let you hold our baby. Let her. No. Let her hold the baby. Maybe it's not as bad as we think. Russ! Well, at least they're our friends. Where's Edna? Well, I don't know. In the bathroom, I guess. I think I heard the baby. Why did you wake him? He woke up by himself. Give him to me. Really, carol, he likes me. Look. Give me my baby. Ourbaby, darling. What are we going to do? I don't know. We'll have to work something out. How can you be sure? I can't... but which is the nearest execution square? 1-5-4. We're directly under 1-5-4. Now, listen... the post must be dead center. I'm sorry, but I am not leaving the baby here. Only on certain days, carol. I'll look after him, I promise. If you want a baby so badly, Why don't you have one of your own? It's against the law, remember? Look, uh... can't we come to some kind of arrangement that... that we can live with... something... I don't know... every other day... Something like that. No. All right. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. You son of a bitch. What are you going to do? It's a lousy world. Today's my day, carol. You look after him. Take good care of him. I will. Hey. Give her the baby. But I... I don't want to disturb him. Give her the baby. You know, he likes it here. He slept all night. By the way, this is your last day. What did you say? I said this is your last day. We're keeping the boy with us permanently. We think he'll be safer. You never know when someone might inform on you, do you? You haven't eaten. Neither have you. You're not taking the baby. What did you say? I said the baby stays. But you've... the baby's got to come with us. Tell them, George. We've got to have Jesse with us. That's right. I want that baby, And I want it now. George, we are not playing around anymore. What do you think you're doing? One word from me and you And her and the baby have had it! Shut up, George! What the hell do you think you're saying? I want that baby. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Please... I'm sorry. It's all over. Jesse stays with us... all the time. You're crazy. You are crazy. You're all crazy. I'm taking the baby out of here now. I'm taking this baby out now. George, it's a doll! It's not Jesse. You're dead. You bastard! You're dead! George! Help me, mummy! Help me! I'll kill them. I'll kill them all! They've got my baby! They've taken my baby! I'll kill them! I'll kill them all! I hate them all! Get a hold of yourself. My baby. They've got my baby. Come on! Get a hold of yourself! I want my baby. My baby! Give me back my baby! I want my baby! Let me in! I want the baby! Give us back our baby! My baby! Open up! My baby! Open up, you bastard! Open up! Give me back my baby! Baby! My baby! My baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Baby! Our baby! Kill them! Kill them! Baby! Some people never learn. Baby! Kill them! They deserve every bit of this. Baby! Kill them! Baby! Baby! Kill them! Baby! Kill! Baby! Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em! Baby! Kill them! Baby! Kill them! Where are they? Kill them! They took... They took my baby. Kill them! My baby. They took my baby away. Kill them! Kill them, kill them, kill them! Kill them! Clear the immediate area.
