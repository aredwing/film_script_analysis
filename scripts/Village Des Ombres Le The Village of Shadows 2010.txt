It's useless! Fire! Fire, in God's name! Strempel, if you're behind the door, get down! Get down! Klaus... I beg you... Don't do it. Don't worry, Sergeant. Trust me... Ulrich. Rubbish! Stop, Mathias! You don't have any more scary ones in your book? - Yeah, but that one worked ok. - For you, everything works! What, for me? - What? - What? I didn't say anything. - Shut up. - I didn't say anything. No-one else has another scary story? No, that's enough. I like it. You read weird things. Legends, Superstitions and True Curses. This is a rare book. Emma, put your seatbelt on, please. Why doesn't he let me lead? We'd already be there. You don't know the way, don't moan. I'm not moaning. Chill out. You're chilled out alright. I don't have my sister bugging me. - Damn it! - Feel sick again? Yeah. You want us to stop? Don't barf in the car. Just the sandwich not going down. Last time I eat on the freeway! It's your stories that don't go down. You think it's funny because it never happened to you. - And to you it did? - What? - No, no. - Go on, you started. You started, you finish, Lila. The story with the girl? What story with the girl? This sounds very interesting. Lila, go on, tell it. - You're a drag. - Ok, drop it... A little argument? Keep your eyes on the road, huh? We should have gone in Hugo's car. Who invited Hugo? He's your sister's boyfriend, didn't you know? She didn't tell me. I wanted to tan. I know what we can do... What's your problem? Is it me? Give me some time, Hugo, please. Pardon Katia, what was that? - Leave it out, Hugo... - I thought she said something. I didn't say anything. She does talk! Me, at least I speak all languages. - Stan, can you translate? - Is it Stan or Stephane? Stan. It's his stage name. That's my baby. Check this out. Funky! Cool! Turn it up! What's the story with the girl? Go on! When I was little... I often went on holiday to my aunt's, near Madrid. One afternoon, I was playing ball with the other kids... opposite the neighbor's house. At one point... I threw it too hard and the ball went into the garden of the house next door... I was freaking out. I couldn't find the ball. I could hear the others laughing. And suddenly... She said... My name is Elena. Do you want to play with me? No one lived in the house? No. The garden was a jungle. I asked her where her parents were. You wanna play in the pool? The GPS is gone. We're lost. Is that it? The last inhabitants of the house were a couple. With a little girl... called Elena. They had been living there a few months... and one day... they discovered... their daughter... dead... drowned... at the bottom of the pool. You're kidding? I'm used to it. No one ever believes me. I believe you. You talked to a dead person? Fuck! - What the fuck? - Call him, please. He doesn't know the route. Voicemail. - What are you playing at... Call me! - Why did I let her go with him? - He's crazy. - Don't worry. You see them? Watch out! Marion! Marion? Damn! Hugo! - Where are they? - We only lost them for 30 seconds. Marion? Hugo? Where are you? Does anyone have a signal? - No. - Me neither. I can't start the car. - What shall we do? - We can't stand here in the rain. Let's go to your grandparents' house. We'll find a solution... - Are you crazy? - We can do nothing here! There'll be someone who can help us. We're gonna freeze here, that's all. - Emma, listen to me! - No, you listen! I'm not leaving without my sister! Ok? They've gone to the village! We can't be far! We're already here. Emma... We can call them from the house. Come on. PIERRE LEVEE CLINIC Are you ok? The house isn't far now. Marion? Is anybody there? Is there anybody here? This way. - Shit. - Wait. Here. CASTLE HOUSE Welcome to Castle House. There's no dial tone. My parents must have cut the line. We only use this place for vacations. - I'll try the neighbor, I know him. - We didn't see anyone. How do you know he's there? People go to bed early in small villages. I'll go check. - Wanna come with me, Mathias? - Yeah. My grandma used to say when I was naughty that she would leave me in Ruiflec. I remember now. She called it ''the Village of Shadows''. She said in Ruiflec, you never know what's hiding in the dark. Are you ok? We have to leave here, David. I don't know why we came to this dump. Ruiflec, what a dumb name! - I don't trust your Lucas. - He's not my Lucas. It was his idea to come here. He's into you, no? You have a problem with that? - You introduced me to him. - I've only known him 2 months. He's not your buddy? Nobody knows the guy but we all followed him. - Shut the door. - Go and shut it, David! Lock the door! What happened? It's Lucas... he was walking in front of me... He hit me. With something. - Let me see. - No! Get the first aid kit from my bag. I thought he was gonna kill me. He had this look... I've never seen him like that. Why'd he do that? You think I know? - We can't stay here. - I agree. I'm not going anywhere until we find Marion. Don't look at me like that, it won't change anything. It was moved recently. It's burning hot. I'm not sure. - It looks like Hugo. - Your sister's boyfriend? This drawing looks like it was done years ago. Hugo wouldn't have... Marion! I'm sorry. It's ok. What have you been doing all this time? I was looking for you. I was looking for you. Where are the others? I have no idea. We were driving... We reached the village. I fell asleep. Then I heard you. That's it. I don't know any more. - Your story doesn't make sense. - He's right, it's not clear. If all the others disappeared, why not you? It's only half an hour since he passed us on the road. When I listen to her, it sounds like hours. It's just bullshit. Can you believe these two? They think I'd make up a story just to scare you? Don't touch me. You were outside? Alone in this shithole? You saw your friends disappear before your eyes? Stop it, Marion. No! Then shut the fuck up! That's funny. - Which one is the big sister? - David. - You're going too far. - I'm right, no? Everybody calms down. We have other damn problems! No. She's bullshitting us and we're falling for it. And what about that? Is that your boyfriend's idea too? What are you talking about? Why are you showing me that? - It's not the right one. - I didn't let go of it! Hugo's face was there! You saw it, right? We have to stop trying to understand. We have to get out of here. - She's right. Get the gear and go. - How? - Both cars are dead. - We'll walk, we'll hitch. We leave the others? And Lucas? If he's gone crazy, there must be a reason. - What do you suggest? - We have to look for them. They would look for us. No. We're leaving. No discussion. I'm sure we came this way. Where did this forest come from? Lila? I beg you, we can't go further. - Honey... - Do you trust me? We can't stay here alone, let's go. Be careful. What's happening? Tell me. Lila, calm down. Look at us, please. Lila, what's wrong? Lila, what's wrong? Answer me. I saw... I saw people. I saw something. - What did you see? - Something happened here. - What happened? - I don't know. I don't know. Gently. - Can you walk? - Yes. What's that? Where's Mathias? Mathias? It's my fault. It's my fault. Why didn't I stop you coming here? Who are you? What do you want? What have we done to you? Come here... David, look at me. All that's just children's stories. You must have the wrong name. That village didn't exist for years. We kept walking straight ahead. We're back here again? It's still going. The village... it seems to be alive. And wants to hurt us. It wasn't this house. That's a Mauser! David, be careful. What's that doing there? That dates from the Occupation. It's from August 8, 1944... WAGNER, 8.8.44. August 8... That's today! - Do you think... - Lie down! David! Wait! You're crazyI He could have killed youI I didn't think. Was it Lucas? No. I saw a soldier. There's something out there. What shall we do? Let's go. Stay here, I'll take a look. What are you doing? Don't go out there! We stay together this time. Please. Please. Don't worry. David! LilaI Get down! Get down! David, get down! Get down! Get down, David! Emma! You killed himI DavidI It's ok, Lila. It's ok. - Listen to me. - No, it's not ok. No one will get away. Look where we are. We're being hunted like animals! You think we have a chance? Why us any more than the others? Just lie down! Wait your turn! Give in, as usual. - I'm not really surprised, Marion. - You sound like Dad, no surprise. Little miss perfect, does everything right! But you're not in control here! Are you in therapy now? If you don't like me leading, that's your problem! I never wanted that role. You're the eldest! We didn't see anyone die! No-one! You know what I did when you disappeared? I looked for you! So that's what we do! We have to believe! Lucas... I saw Lucas. At that window. He was there, I swear. Let's go. Come on, Lila. I don't know if I can make it. Of course you can. Because I'm here. I'm with you now. MUNICIPAL LIBRARY He was watching us from here. He must still be here. - They've gone to the villageI - We can't be farI - We're already here. - Welcome to Castle House. - We can't stay here. - I'm sorry... Don't touch meI You were outside? Alone in this shithole? Where did this forest come from? - Something happened here. - What do you want? - Where's Mathias? - It's from August 8, 1944. Lie downI I saw a soldier. - Get down, DavidI - You killed himI No one will get away. David... Lucas? Who did these drawings? The one who's tricking us. It's like a registry of births. It's not a registry of births. It's always the same day. And the same month. August 8. Wait. Ulrich Wagner. There's a pattern. The 8. What? The number 8, look. 1944, 1952. Every 8 years. Every 8 years, August 8. Like today. There are always 8 names on each list. What's at the end? Why 9 names? Why are there 9 names on our list? There are 9 lines on every list. And the paper is lighter here... There too, there was a 9th name... but it's been wiped out. Why? Lucas is on the list? Maybe he's a victim? Maybe he wants us to believe that. It's me... The next one is me. I won't leave you, Lila. I won't leave you. No! Come on! EXI There's a passage there! It wasn't there before, let's try! Lila... David? Lila? Lila! Marion! Marion... Lila... where are you? Answer me! Let us go... Please! Lila... David? Emma? Marion! Where are you? Give me your hand! The drawings... You did them? Why? Why are you doing this to us? I want to see David again... Please. Marion! It's ok, I'm here! It's ok. Don't move. You're holding me too tight, stop! Stay close to me. Lila... Medical report.: Termination of pregnancy I have something to tell you... Mathias had this book in the car! They're all the same! Ruiflec! Page 88. What? There. ''Ruiflec... the Village of Shadows.'' RUIFLEC.: THE VILLAGE OF SHADOWS ''August 8, 1784... ''a young peasant vanished at Ruiflec leaving no trace. ''Those responsible for the kidnapping were known to all the village. ''Eight nobles who, terrified by the popular uprisings, ''had chosen to flee Paris and move to Ruiflec. ''They feared the extinction of their kind. ''And sought the means to prolong their earthly lives. ''At any price.'' Sires, hereby... expressly note the creation of the Order of Eight. ''Death itself may die, my brothers in arms.'' If you turn the 8, it's perpetual motion. Infinity. Keep going! ''Every 8 years, in the 8th month, ''the members of the Order of Eight captured an innocent, chosen at random.'' Have pity, Sires, no! ''They were convinced their victim would return from the dead ''bringing the Key to Immortality. ''After the first seven sacrifices, none of the victims returned. ''But the 8th time...'' Mama! August 8, 1840 Mama... Let me go! Let me go! Help, Mama! Bastien... I beg you, spare me. Mama! Bastien! Let me go! Not my son! Not my son! Please! Please! Mama! Mama, where are you? Mama, save me... Please... Please! Mama, help! Mercy, I beg you! Let me... Let me go, I beg you! I beg you, spare me! Sires, I beg you, please! Sires, please. Let me go! ''The child was buried beside the seven other victims... ''in what was later called the Clearing of the Innocents. ''And on the 8th day... ''But what returned from the dead ''was no longer a child... nor even human. ''It tore apart its 8 torturers ''with a bloody rage. ''The inhabitants of Ruiflec, ''knowing that the child's rage would turn against them ''tried to show the demon his suffering was not their fault. ''They hoped these offerings would save their families. ''But it wasn't enough to appease his anger. ''Since then, no one can leave Ruiflec ''until the curse on the village ''is broken.'' There's a page missing, it's been torn out. There's a way to get out, in this book. How can this map help us? The village keeps changing! There must be a way. The Clearing of the Innocents. Look! The Clearing of the Innocents is exactly in the center of the symbol. It's the real heart of Ruiflec. We should go there! Marion? Yeah. I know. I know you lost it. Don't worry... I didn't tell mum and dad. Why didn't you tell me? Now we're talking. You really pick your moment. - You think it's the end? - No, we'll get out of here. You keep saying that. Now shut the fuck up! - Marion, I don't... - Shut it! No, Marion! Lila? Stop! I don't want to play. I don't want to play anymore! Wait! - I saw... - It's here. The Clearing of the Innocents. This is where Lila passed out. Except... that wasn't there before. Castle House. The Disappeared of Ruiflec August 8, 1944 Let's go, FrolichI We have to leave this villageI SoldiersI Forward marchI Does anyone have a light? I'm not going to tell you the story of Ruiflec. You already know it. But I don't know if you know my story. That's really... a scary story. I was born here. In Ruiflec. My parents were too poor to leave the village. My father clung to his land. Like a tick clings to skin. So we stayed. We were the only ones left. And one day... in 1928... You know what happens here. He took them all. My father... My brother... My sister... My mother. The real question is... why... why did he leave me? Why? Because there was nobody else. Everyone had gone! So he chose me... For better and for worse. Every 8 years, 8 little mice to feed the mean little cat. But Lucas brought us here! I suggested this little country weekend... Where are your neighbors? Mathias! Castle House is not his grandparents' house... It's my house. He really liked you... Too bad. - You killed them all! - I never killed anyone! I never killed anyone. He wants you to feel the same terror he did. When they took him from his mother, he became cruel like his torturers. He draws well, no? What a waste! He had talent. You think you're walking in the streets of Ruiflec, but you're in the labyrinth of his crazy mind. In Ruiflec, he makes the rules. I don't think it works, that one. It does. Let her go! You're hurting me! I'm impressed, Emma. You've been right from the start. We can get out of here. - Normally, only I know. - Tell me! Tell me, Mathias! Tell me! Tell me! Ask your sister. You can't do it, Marion. Immortality is not a gift! You can't go back. Even me, I'd often like to die. He killed Death itself... Those who burned him didn't profit from that. But I did. And I can tell you it's a real nightmare... You can't get close to anyone. You watch the people you love... die. And the worst... is that you're exactly like his victims... Plus you feel the guilt. You belong to him for ever. It's your turn, now. Welcome to his madness. Welcome to Ruiflec... Marion... - What's happening? - Don't look. August 8, 2008 That's it? It's over? It's over. Can we go now? Don't leave me, Hugo! I beg you! No! Mama... Marion! I'm sorry. He has no mother. - We need each other. - What? I'm his family, now. No, Marion... Don't leave me. Please. Don't leave me... He needs 8. I'm cold... There's just one missing... Are you ok? I think there's a garage nearby. Thank you. Where do you come from? From Ruiflec. Ruiflec? I haven't heard that name for years... My grandma used to say, when I was naughty, that she would leave me in Ruiflec. She called it ''the Village of Shadows''... Because in Ruiflec, you never know what's hiding in the dark. That's just children's stories. You must have the wrong name. That village hasn't existed for years. Very pretty. Mama... To Bibia, my mother, my inspiration...
