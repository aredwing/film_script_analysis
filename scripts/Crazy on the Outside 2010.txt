Speaking of France, Tom, you think you'll be going back there anytime soon? - What do you mean? - Well, it's just that, statistically speaking, people who go to France and then get out of France... usually end up back in France. - [Grandmother Screams] - [Vehicle Approaching] - [Horn onks, ires Screech] - re we expecting anyone? - [Engine Revving] - ou stay.
