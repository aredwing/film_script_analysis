The board is not pleased with the current state of affairs. Affairs? Namely the selfish attitude displayed by the world's children. The board is of the opinion that you share some responsibility in this erosion of the true spirit of Christmas. The true spirit of Christmas is the giving of oneself. That message is being lost. Children today worship money. They only think in terms of give me this and give me that. I don't understand. Children sit on your knee. Yes. And tell you what they want. Yes. And you give it to them. Yes. Course sometimes you choose not to. Connie... Is this about the pony? It's Constance... And that has nothing to do with my feelings today! Changes need to be made. What kind of changes? It's time for you to step down. Ho, ho ho ho ho! Who will replace me? No one. You're canceling Christmas? Just the Santa part. Of course the board will retain all rights to your image for merchandising purposes and so on. But your actual services, will no longer be needed. Paragraph four of my contract clearly states that I cannot be forcibly retired. I'm well aware of paragraph four. The terms also state, that you are to foster an attitude of holiday cheer year round. And engender the spirit of Christmas in all the young. Yes, well we'll settle for three. Farley Morgan, and his best and only friend, Steven Rojack. Two students at Riverbrook Academy, an exclusive private school. Two uncontrolled and uncontrollable hellions. This one is a little different. Adam Claymore. His mother is a teacher at Riverbrook Academy; he was put into a wheelchair last year after a car accident that also took the life of his father. His anger has shut him off from Christmas, and what's worse, from his mother. Provide verifiable proof that your influence has inspired an attitude in accordance with the true meaning of Christmas and you get to keep your job. And if I don't? Christmas is cancelled. You have thirty days. Thirty days, that's right up 'til Christmas Eve. I'm well aware. Oh and one more thing... You're prohibited from revealing your true identity to them. What's this? It's a phone. Don't tell me you're that far behind the times. I know it's a phone. Why are you giving it to me? If you should succeed, at any of your three tasks, this phone will ring. Good luck. Thank you. Merry Christmas, Connie. Merry Christmas, Santa. Three rings. Randal. You were eavesdropping. I thought you might need backup. This Constance woman is a real, a real... Bah Humbug? Exactly! Failure is not an option. Here. What in tarnation is this? While she was speaking, I was doing research on Farley and Steve. I hope you find that very useful. What do I do with this? You plug it into your laptop. I have a laptop? Okay, let's go. Time is a wasting. You're in charge. Oooohhhh! Now that wasn't so bad, was it? I still prefer traveling by reindeer. I miss the old chin warmer. You are going to get used to it my friend. I understand that we have to be incognito. I know the importance of not being recognized. But why the ridiculous clothing? Randal, you know how we look on the outside doesn't matter. It's what's inside that counts. What name are you gonna use when we're here? Kris Frost. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You think about that all by yourself? You're going to love yours, Mr. Elfman. Ho, ho ho ho ho! Hey, Farley. Hey, what's up, man? Thanks, boy. Go, go. Hey, catch ya later, Kip. You got it? I got it. Let's do it. Hi, Mom. Mom this really isn't the best time right now. Love you. Bye. Ready? One, two, three. There ya go. I can do it myself! Okay. Careful, it's gotta be centered in the bowl. This is gonna be awesome. We will go down in the history of this school. Let's go. Good morning, Mrs. Claymore. Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How's your boy doing? As good as can be expected. These things take time. I know but it feels like it's taking forever. He's a good boy. I think most kids are basically decent. Oh here, Miss Claymore, let me. Oh, thank you. Aaahh! I am so sorry, Mr. Johnson. I'll make sure whoever did this gets punished. I don't know how you can stand working with kids like that. For two cents I'd quit this job. Farley Morgan and Steven Rojack, principal's office. NOW. What did we do? You know very well. Go. Now! My dad has given a zillion dollars to this school, Principal Barnes will believe what I tell her. We'll see about that. I hope you two put as much effort into your science projects as you did this prank. Impressive resume, Mr. Frost. Thank you. SNIFF-SNIFF Peppermint? Candy cane. You're the janitor, right? Let me see. Coveralls, surly disposition, intense dislike of children, yeah that makes me the janitor. How long have you been practicing the custodial arts? Twenty-two years. Seems like you're in need of a change. You just talkin', or you got something in mind? Good pay, frostbite insurance, free hot chocolate and two weeks winter vacation in Boca Raton! The community for all seasons. How soon can I start? Well how about you get changed and hand in your notice? I would love to hire you, Mr. Frost, but I'm afraid we already have a janitor. Oh? I'm happy to keep your resume on file if anything comes up. Oh, excuse me. Yes? What do you mean he quit? A job opportunity up North? What does that even mean? Never mind... Thank you. Um, it appears, we have an opening. I hope you have room for my assistant. We don't have money in our budget. Mr. Elfman works for free. You're hired, both of you. Joy to the world. Ahh, Mrs. Claymore. Jeannie. Mr. Frost? Kris. Nice to meet you. And you. Rough morning, huh? Typical morning when dealing with junior high schoolers. Ah, it can't be all that bad? Have you ever worked at a school before? First day. Wait 'til you meet Farley Morgan, you will rue the day you took Mr. Johnson's place. Thank you for the warning. My associate tells me that Mr. Johnson was renting a room from you? Yes, was is right. He's moving out this afternoon. Is it big enough for two? It's a room above the garage. There's only room for one bed, but it does have a sofa that pulls out. Perfect. Ha, ha. It's hardly perfect. It's cozy. Would you like to come over and have a look? No need. My associate and I sorely need a roof over our heads, we'll take it. That's wonderful. Ha, ha! Wow, I didn't know what I was going to do when Mr. Johnson left. To be honest, I need the rent money to make ends meet. Somebody must be watching over me today. Somebody must. I'll see you after school. Okay. Thank you. Good to meet you, Kris. And you. Come in! I just wanted to know what you decided about Farley and Steven. I gave them a warning. A warning... I think a month's detention would have been more appropriate. They promised not to do it again. And you believe that? There were other factors to consider. I get it, Farley threatened to call his father. And he hasn't made his yearly contribution to the school yet, right? The boy lost his mother three years ago. I know that, and believe me I have bent over backwards to cut him all sorts of slack. But he's getting worse. Somebody has to say no to him. It's just matter of time before he hurts somebody, or himself, with all these pranks. I promise you. The next time he acts out, I'll deal with it. Promise? I ran into Jeannie Claymore. She's a very nice lady. Look at this stuff. It's pathetic. Oh, it's fine. This is supposed to bring Christmas spirit? I can't do it. Sure you can. An artist is only as good as his tools. Give me something to work with, tinsel, bubble lights... Cranberries and popcorn strung together on a string!!! You'll do fine with this. I won't do fine with this. I have a reputation to uphold. I have people that look up to my decoration skills. I don't do second-class decoration. Why don't you call Mrs. Claus and have her send down some of the good stuff? Okay, I can do that. Here we go. Look who we got here. You must be Johnson's replacement. And you must be Farley. He knows your name? I know a lot of names Steven. I'm Mr. Frost, and this is Mr. Elfman. You know my first name, but do you know my last name as well? It's Morgan. As in Morgan gymnasium. And the Morgan Reference Library, and the Morgan Public Park. My father donates a lot of money to this school and the community. That makes me a V.I.P. around here. Ah, you hear that Frost. We're in the presence of a very important pipsqueak. Farley, have you ever donated any money to this school? Or to anyone else for that matter? SMASH! My bad. SMASH! Why don't you go down to Santa's square, sit on his knee and ask him for some new decorations? I remember when you sat on Santa's knee and asked for a puppy. How would you know that? I know a lot of things about you boys. I know Steven wants to be professional drummer. He's got a set of Slingerland classic five drums in his garage. That his father bought for him that he's paying off very slowly. Farley Granger Morgan. Granger? Before I'd laugh, your middle name is Rolob. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You're named after a movie star that your mother had a crush on. And you've never paid for anything in your life. Who are you? I'm the janitor. There goes an angry and troubled boy. Who could put an end to Christmas as we know it. Yes... I'm gonna get a broom. Well, here it is. Like I said, it's not much, but it's cozy. We'll take it. Wonderful, I'll go get the rental agreement. Excellent. You sure this is such a good idea? It's all part of my master plan. Oh, you have a master plan. Well, I have a plan. A plan. Just a regular plan? Downgraded from a master plan. Good. Oh, that wasn't so hard. I hope you don't intend for us to live with Farley Morgan too. Oh no, he's a wreath of a different colour. But I, I wanna do some more research on him, where's that inter... interweb? Oh, yes. Thank you. You're welcome. What do I do with this? You plug it into the USB port. Mmmhmm. Which I will do for you. Okay, now what? Click on Farley's name. With the mouse. Don't, I will do it. Farley Morgan, age fourteen, only child. Farley lives with his father, Charles Morgan. Farley's mother died of Lou Gehrig's disease when he was thirteen. I remember her. I liked her. I got her the dog she gave to Farley for Christmas. Athletically, Farley excels as a swimmer. Academically, his best grades are in science. For more information click the appropriate icon in the drop down menu. KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK! Come in! Quick question before we sign the papers. Would you like to join Adam and me for dinner? I'm an excellent cook. We would love to. Great, I'll set two more places at the table. Thank you. Dinner's ready, Sir. Thanks, William. Is my dad back from San Francisco? The conference went longer than he expected. He will be back for my science fair, won't he? I can't wait to show him what I've been working on. He assured me he wouldn't miss it. Okay. Hello, Adam. Welcome. Adam, we're having guests tonight for dinner. Why don't you come in and wash up. I'll help. I can do it myself! Adam doesn't like that. I want to put in a wheelchair ramp to make it easier for him, but with all the medical bills I barely have enough to pay the mortgage. Since the accident, that's where Adam sleeps. It was a utility room, as you can see it's really small. He used to stay upstairs? I tried carrying him up and down the stairs for a while but he just got upset. Eventually I just decided it was easier to move everything down to the first floor. We never know all the things that are going to cause us problems, until we have the problems. That's for sure. Hungry? Yes. Adam, you've hardly said anything all dinner. Adam's a little shy around new people. Are you excited about Christmas? Have you asked Santa what you want? I don't believe in Santa. He's just a fairytale. Really? Fairytales don't prepare you for the real world. I think there are a lot of children' literature teachers who would disagree with you on that. Well, as a teacher, I don't think it's healthy to fill a child's head with misinformation. And I'm bothered that he's always portrayed as fat and Caucasian. Santa represents all that's best in the human heart, what he looks like on the outside doesn't matter. Maybe Santa looks like whatever the children want him to look like. Yes. Tell me, Mr. Frost, do you think Santa exists? I believe Santa exists as long as there are people who believe in him. Well I'll believe that when I meet him face to face. Oh, ho ho. Anyone for dessert? Yes! How 'bout some milk and cookies? I'll have whatever anyone doesn't finish. I've been thinking about my whole responsibility in this gimmie gimmie syndrome, and Constance may have a point. I should see what I can do about this. You sure you have time to do that? And converting the three boys to the true spirit of Christmas? Well the only thing I can do with the boys is to play up the idea. I can't change them, they have to do that themselves. With a little help from us! By the way, could you set up a little Santa mall session for me? I really want to get a lap side view of things. I'll set you up in one of the malls. First things first. We gotta decorate that school. Oh, I got an e-mail from Mrs. Claus! That's great! She said the packages should arrive at Riverbrook first thing in the morning! Whoa, ho ho ho ho! Oh, joy to the world! Joy to the world! Well, good morning. Good morning. Um, where's your car? Don't have one. Well how do you get to work? We take the bus. Come on, Randal, we're gonna be late! Don't be silly, catch a ride with Adam and I. Oh, thank you anyway, but we can use the time to plan how we're going to decorate the school for Christmas. Ah, okay, well don't say I didn't offer. Drive safe. Ride safe. Nothing like a little holiday atmosphere to create a little holiday cheer. We've only got fifteen minutes until they come in. How did you? Fast bus! Very fast! It's magnificent, Mr. Frost. I didn't realize we had so many decorations in storage. Well, we didn't... They were in the very back of the storage closet. Ah. It looks like the North Pole threw up in here. That tree does sort of kick butt though. Some broken ornaments might ugly it up. All right, everyone! Let's move on, shall we! We still have class today. I wanna know who the janitor is. What do you mean? Who is he? Where'd he come from? How does he know so much about us? We need his info. How you gonna do that? I'll handle it. Farley and Steve, step in here for a minute please. Uh, we're gonna be late for class. Now. I heard the principal let you off with just a warning. She didn't think it was any big deal. I do and you both should have apologized to Mr. Johnson before he left. Too late now. It's kinda hard to apologize to somebody who's not really here. Maybe next time. There better not be a next time. Well who knows what the future has in store. Yeah we're not really psychic, Miss Claymore. Okay, you can go now. But I'm warning you, if there is a next time, I'm complaining all the way up to the school board. Oohhh. Yeah, okay. Hello? Hello, is this Charles Morgan? Yes. Hi, this is Gene Claymore. Farley's teacher. Oh hello, Miss Claymore, what can I do for you? I'd like to set up an appointment with you to talk about Farley. What about him? He's acting out in some pretty major ways. I'm sorry to hear that, Miss Claymore, he's working through a lot of issues. I'm aware that he lost his mother. He's coping as best as he can, I think you should cut him some slack. I, I am, but... You're his teacher, not his therapist. I'm not trying to be his therapist, but I still think we should meet teacher to parent. Fine. I'm away at the moment, when I get back in town, I'll call you and set something up. Maybe tomorrow after the science fair? Um, no, no, that's not good. Um, I'll get back to you. Thanks for calling. You're his teacher, not his therapist? It doesn't take a doctor to know that that kid is going to make life miserable for a lot of people. Farley, shouldn't you be in class? I'm doing a report on Mr. Frost and I need some background info. Such as? Where he worked last, what's his first name? Stuff like that. Kris is the first name you're looking for, but I'm sorry Farley, I can't give you any other info. Why don't you ask Mr. Frost yourself? The assignment is to find out as much as you can from outside sources. How 'bout where he worked last? It'd be great if you could do that much. Farley... I talked to my dad yesterday about the gym renovation. He said he would talk to his accountant first thing. That's wonderful. He's pretty forgetful, though. I might have to call and remind him. Or not. True North Industrial is where Mr. Frost worked last. That's all you get. Thanks, Principal Barnes. You rock, I'll make sure my dad talks to his accountant first thing tomorrow. Well? Nothing, nada. Not even a True North Industrial Group? They're for real, but there's nothing on Mr. Frost or that dorky friend of his. I'm thinking lying on his resume should get him fired. Maybe even a crime, especially working with all these innocent kids. We got him. How can I help you boys? There's something I want to show you. Look what we've got here. Isn't this where you said you worked last before coming here? Did I? I hacked their site, there's no record of you working here. There's nothing on Mr. Elfman either. What's your point? I'm sure Principal Barnes will think of one. Not to mention the school board, the cops. Well I hope you spelled my name right. It's one S. One S, try again. I'll wait. Oh, look at that. If you'll excuse me I have some work to do. Steven. What the... I'm telling you. The dude wasn't there when I looked this morning. That's way freaky. Come on. Ha ha ha ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Freak. Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Who's first? Hello, what's your name? Heather. Heather, that is a beautiful name. Tell Santa what you're going to get your mother this year. Hmm? You know how good you feel when you get a present? You'll feel even better when you give one to your mother or father. Really? Really, and you know why? Because giving a gift to your mother or father is saying I love you. But I don't have any money. You don't need money to give a gift. You could give your mother ten days of helping with the dishes. Or making your bed. Or a month's worth of hugs and kisses. I could do all those things. Yes, you could. And remember that a gift form the heart is more valuable than a gift from the store. Now tell me what you're going to give to your mother. Ho ho ho, that's a wonderful gift! She will love that! Merry Christmas to you! Here ya go, here ya go. Bye bye. Next! What do ya think, Kip? Isn't it cool or what? It's your father. Thanks. Hi, Dad. I'm just finishing it now, I can't wait to show you. Oh... Yeah, it's just some dumb science fair. Yeah, next week. Sure, okay. CRASH! This is Eric Simms, reporting for WALQ, from Santa Square in the downtown mall. I came here this afternoon to report on what I thought would be just one of those heartwarming holiday stories, we always see this time of year. But, it turns out this story had an intriguing twist. One which may change the way we feel about Christmas. A few days ago the regular Santa here was replaced by... well, we're not sure who. You may want to see this. Uh, I'm still trying to compile my naughty and nice list. Instead of asking the children what presents they wanted, our mystery Santa asked them what gifts they wanted to give. This is a big story. And believe it or not, the children got excited. And so did the parents. The story of this mystery Santa has been racing around the blogisphere for the past few days. Then things started getting a little strange. I asked to see the photos, taken here of the children sitting on Santa's lap. You won't believe what you're about to see. The mall photographer swears these images are all taken of the same Santa. If it turns out that these images are not the result of some technological trick, then we may be looking at the first physical proof that Santa Claus isn't a myth. He's real and walking among us. Eric Simms, reporting. How did you do that? It's the magic of Christmas. People see in Santa the best parts of themselves. You think that reporter can give us any trouble? We've got bigger stockings to stuff. I'm still gonna keep an eye on that Eric Simms. We should focus on Farley. The classroom circuit breakers. Hold this. Are you sure this is gonna work? Trust me, one drop of super glue on each circuit breaker will freeze it when they turn it to the off position. By the time they can fix it, the science fair will be history. What is that? Ahhh. That's a little welcome we had planned for you. You might have killed us! Oh, they're just some harmless fireworks. Scared ya, though, didn't it? Not me. Ha ha ha ha ha! Right, Mr. Toughguy. Are you gonna tell Principal Barnes? She'll probably expel you for this. Not unless you can prove we were here. Let's go. It looks like in all the excitement you squeezed that tube of glue. I wouldn't worry though, the police have solvent. The police? Don't you run out on me! I suspect you'll be charged with malicious vandalism. With intent to do bodily harm. We, we weren't trying to hurt anybody. It was just a goof. You think, uh, Farley's father is gonna feel that way about it? I don't think so. But if Principal Barnes and the police. And his father. Don't hear anything about it. Then that's a reindeer of a different colour. Yes, it is. Superglue solvent. A janitor's assistant never leaves home without it. I'll make ya a deal. Okay. What kind of deal? You do something for us and we won't tell anybody. And we'll unglue your hand. What kind of project? I'm in. What about you, Farley? When? Tomorrow morning. First thing. This is Eric. No, let me guess. They claim to know who the mystery Santa is. Okay, okay. What's the name and number? Steve, I'm about to go home. Did you catch any of the science fair? Um, yeah a little. Not a lot. Is everything okay? Yeah, perfect. Never been better, well, I gotta go. Steve, wait. Come here for a minute. It's hard to find time during the day to talk. And I wanna ask you something. Why do you work so hard at trying to convince everyone you're a bad guy? I don't do that. Yeah, you do. You know studying works two ways right? When you're in my classroom studying the material I give you, I also study you. You are? Yeah. And every other kid in my classroom. And when I look at you, I see a basically nice guy doing everything he can to disguise it. It's just that I like to have fun. But it's a mean kind of fun, hmm? Practical jokes, that sort of thing. Like the catapult you and Farley used the other day. I know you were aiming at me. And if that had hit me, I probably would have balled you out and sent you to the principal's office. And I probably would've excused myself and gone somewhere and cried. You would have? Yeah, Steve, I'm not just a teacher, I'm a person too. And it hurts when someone humiliates me. I, I didn't mean to humiliate you. I don't think you did either. I think it's something Farley talked you into. He can be pretty convincing. Yeah. And let's face it. He can buy anything he wants. That's very intimidating. Don't tell him this, but it even intimidates me sometimes. It does? Yeah, I'm a person too, remember? Anyway, I think Farley talks you into things and you don't think about what might happen. Maybe. I just want you to know I think you're a better person than you pretend. That's all. Good night. Night. See ya tomorrow. own, Steve. What numbers? The number of Principal Barnes' cell phone number that I'm gonna call if you don't pay attention. Forty-eight and three quarter inches. That's right. Farley better show up if he knows what's good for him. He'll be here. It's awfully nice of you Steven to come over and help. The boy has a big heart. Can I pet him? Sure, his name's Kip. My name's Adam. You're Farley Morgan. How'd you know that? I was at the ceremony when they opened Morgan Park. My dad forced me to go. Well, thank him for me, I used to use it all the time. Really? Little league. I sometimes used to play Frisbee. I was getting really good at that. What put you in the chair? Car accident. Is the chair temporary? Permanent. That sucks. My dad died too. I lost my mom. Glad you like the park. Where did you come up with the name Kip? It's short for Kipling. Rudyard Kipling. He wrote this poem called "The Power of the Dog." Everyone's working in the garage! I'll be there in a second! I need some water for my dog. Sure, come on inside. Okay. Good boy, Kip. Here, come here. Sit. Good boy. Why didn't you bring your solar robot to the science fair? That's your answer? It broke... Besides, I'm no scientist. I figured it'd be stupid to try to pretend to be somebody I'm not. I don't know what's going on with you, Farley, but your father and I need to talk. Good luck. Well he's coming to meet with me at the school on Tuesday. If he doesn't show up, don't take it personal. I never do. Here ya go. Thanks. Good boy, good boy. I dropped my book and he brought it up for me. My mom was in a chair just like yours before she died. We got Kip trained to do a lot of cool stuff to help her. Kip kicks butt. Steve's in the garage. Stay, Kip. I'm comin'. Hello, this is Eric Simms. I got a message that you had a tip about the mystery Santa. I'm so glad you got back to me, Mr. Simms. Indeed I do. So who is this guy? I'm not at liberty to say, but I encourage you to stick with this story. You're onto something big. Something very big. Okay, well, well thank you very much. I appreciate the tip. Lower it, slowly. Slowly, slowly. Ha ha ha! How you doin there? Excellent, it's looking very good. Kinda taking a lot longer than I thought. Well, it'd be a lot better if we had help from Farley. What about Farley? Speak of the devil. Some refreshments from Miss Claymore. That is excellent. Here you are. Oops, my bad, uh, that's mine. Miss Claymore told me you drink milk. That's right. Thank you. Are you guys just gonna leave those cookies there? Cause I would like every single one! Can I? You don't mind? Are you gonna finish your cookie? Do you want it? Yup! I took a bite of it. That's not a problem! Oh, hello! Wow, that looks terrific. You've done an amazing job. Thank you, Mrs. Claymore. Would you all like to stay for dinner? Would love to. Aw, sorry, we gotta go. There's our ride. Let's go. See you guys tomorrow! See ya. Thank you both, so much. You're welcome. Hey, you think you could give me ride tomorrow too? Yeah, sure. Well I guess I'll get dinner started. I'll see you in, um, about an hour. Excellent, thank you! SNAP! Now I know how Andorra must have felt! Hey, whoa, how did you get this installed so quickly? We're early risers. Solid. Oh, my. This looks great! Adam come on out! This is so cool! Why don't you give it a try? Okay. Easy now. Nice and slow. Take your time. There ya go. Cool! Easy round the corner. There ya go. Adam, you got it. Wow. So awesome! This is so cool! Thank you so much, you guys! You're welcome. There ya go. It's too hard. I can't do it. It's okay. It'll just take a little practice, sweetie. Okay. You can do it. Come on. I can't do it! Here, watch this. Come on, Kip. Sit. Come on. Good boy. Ha ha ha ha! That was so cool! This is the best Christmas present ever! Well it was all you, buddy. Yeah. Did you do this for you mom, too? Yeah, but with a rolling start you can make it on your own. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! HONK-HONK! Bye, Farley! Bye. You coming? Uh, naw, it's okay I'll walk. I'll catch ya later. Okay. Bye, Adam. See ya. You know I've been thinking it'd be pretty stellar if we could do more for Adam. Stellar? It would be pretty cool, if we could think of a way, you know, to get Adam up those stairs so he could be in his normal bedroom and not be stuck in that closet. Yeah. Did you see that little dude's face light up when he did the ramp? Giving feels pretty stellar. Yeah, it does. I'm gonna start thinking of a way to get Adam up the stairs. Maybe make it like a Christmas present for the little dude. That would be a wonderful present. I'm gonna think about it. See ya! See ya. You straight up about knowing a cop that will do it? Dude, I've got it right here. Fingerprints and all. Cool, I'll be there asap. I don't really feel comfortable with this. Aw, it's only for a few minutes. It's not the time that bothers me so much, it's the whole dressing up bit. He won't be threatened by a grandmotherly type. Where did you get the dress? From Jeannie's closet. I'm gonna have to let it out. You told me his plane leaves at 8:20. You don't have much time. Flight 308 to Atlanta will now begin pre-boarding... Thank you. I'm sorry, I didn't see you there. Oh, that's okay! You know there really is a wonderful article in there on the best dogs for retirement! I haven't read that one yet. Why would ya? You don't look a day over twenty-five! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hardly. I'm Charles Morgan. Rand... ine. That's an unusual name. I've never met another one. Well it's nice to meet you, Randine. Are you retired? Could be soon. I'm sorry, I didn't see you sit down. Oh, I was in the back worrying. You look like someone I could come over and talk to. I hope you don't mind. Oh, I don't know if I could be any help. I bet you help people all the time. I could really use a man's point of view. Well, I'm all ears. It's my twelve-year-old grandson. What's his problem? David has always been a happy kid, smart as a whip too. Two years ago his mother died, he was devastated. Yes, I um, know the feeling. Now he's doing terrible in school, he's a real troublemaker. Lies all the time. Seems mad at the world. I guess I can see why you're worried. The real worry is my son Robert, his father. What's he doing? It's what he's not doing. What do you mean? Robert is constantly traveling with business, sometimes for weeks at a time. Doesn't attend any of David's school functions, even when he promises he will. I know for a fact that the boy's teacher has tried to set up appointments to talk about David's troubles, but Robert always finds a reason not to show. Well maybe the reasons are important. More important than his own son? No, no, of course not. I know that he's lost the love of his life, but his boy is hurting too. It seems to me that if Robert would stop avoiding reality and face this together with his son, so they can heal, move forward with their lives. Yes, well maybe it's not that easy. It won't be that easy. But it's what needs to be done. It's what Michelle would want. Michelle? She was my son's wife. Oh... I don't know what... Morgan residence. William, it's Charles. How was the flight to Budapest, Sir? I haven't boarded my connection. I'm cancelling the rest of my trip, William. I'm gonna hop on the next flight, should be home Tuesday. Farley will be pleased to hear that. I want you to tell Farley I want to have dinner with him that night. Yes, Sir. Uh, what is Farley's teacher's name? Mrs. Claymore. Claymore, Claymore, yes. Can you call this Claymore woman and schedule a meeting with her at her earliest convenience. I'll be happy to do that, Sir. Thank you, William. What guy won't talk to a grandmother? I'm never doing drag for you again. My calves still hurt from the high heels. Ho, ho! Hey, you know how we were talking about a way to get Adam up those stairs? Well, I have an idea that is off the hook. Off the hook? He means that it's a fantastic idea. Oh so that's like off the chain? Same thing. I'm really stoked about this. Stoked? What is the idea? It's called the 'Mobius', in the wheelchair world it rules. I mean how sweet is that? It climbs up curbs, stands on two wheels and travels through sand. A bunch of other cool stuff too. If Adam had one of these he'd be one mobile dude. Impressive. If he had that he'd practically be an all-terrain vehicle. How expensive is that? I'm gonna level with you Mr. F, it costs some serious coin. But that's where we come in. How so? We organize and raise the money. That's some beaucoup dollars though. You think you can do it before Christmas? It'd be one wicked present to get the little dude. Haven't got much time. I know. How can we help? You could open up an account at the bank to hold the funds we raise. Maybe even contact the wheelchair people to get us a deal? Okay. Have you thought about contacting a local company? And having them match funds. You raise half then they match half. That's an awesome idea. Thank you, Mr. F. Oh and don't forget we gotta, uh, keep this on the down low from Mrs. Claymore. Okay. Okay, see ya. Think he can do it? There's no comparison between that which is lost by not succeeding, and that which is lost by not trying. Our clock is ticking, there's only nine days left until Christmas. Chillax, Randal. By the way, what does on the down low mean? And I was hoping you would help. Yeah right, what you really want me to do is hit up my dad for some skrilla to pay for the chair. That is so not true, dude. Okay, cause this is stuff I want our class to do ourselves. What about Mr. Frost, he in on this too? He's helping. There's something weird about him. He's okay, man. You trust him and not your best friend you've known since kindergarten. Look, dude... I am not mad at the whole world like you! Okay, I just thought that because you've been around a person in a chair you'd understand what this could mean to Adam. I guess I was wrong. Farley, my precious boy. By the time you watch this, I'll be gone. I know right now this is hard for you, but one day you'll understand how lucky we were to have shared so much together in such a short time. Farley, wherever you go, whatever you do, I'll be with you. I'll be at the swim meets, cheering you on. I'll be in the audience when you graduate from high school and college. I'll be there when you fall in love, and I'll be in that first pew when you get married. And I'll have my arms around you in the hard times. I have them around you right now. So what I'm trying to do is raise money to get this wheelchair. It's really cool, it's like this futuristic wheelchair that climbs stairs and stuff. Awesome, thank you very much, Sir. Have a good day. So you guys are gonna take this way, right? Okay, so we'll grab some for you. We are gonna go this way. Okay, cool. There you go. You guys can share them all right? See ya, guys. And I was hoping that you'd help me raise some money for a charity to get a chair for an underprivileged kid. Perfect. Thank you very much, have a good day. I was beginning to think you wouldn't be here to welcome me home. I had stuff to do. Well, I wanna know all about school, how you're doing. Is steak okay? It's fine. It's been a long time since we've sat down at the dinner table. And who's fault is that? Mine, of course. All that's going to change, I promise. Like you promised to be here for the science fair. I'm sorry about that. Whatever. It's very good, William. I'll tell Marion. How do you like your steak? He likes it medium rare. They'll be up shortly. Pretty weak when William knows how I like my steak and you don't. Okay I get it, you're angry with me. I probably have it coming. Probably? Look, I don't appreciate this. I don't think your mother would want it this way either. How would you know? What is that suppose to mean? She left a DVD telling us a lot of things she wanted, but you've never looked at it, have you? I know you lost your mother the night Michelle died. I lost my wife. My friend, my partner. The woman I'd spent years with, building a life together. When you're an adult, maybe you'll understand. I'm pretty sure I'm adult enough to understand I lost more than my mom. Welcome home. I see a little improvement. Although that's just my own personal observation. I'm not a psychologist or anything. I was completely out of line, I apologize. You're probably in a better position to judge Farley than any psychologist. You see him in action every day. So you see some improvement? Farley and his friends helped build my son a wheelchair ramp. That doesn't sound like Farley. No, actually it doesn't. I think the janitor talked him into it. The janitor? I know it doesn't make any sense, but somehow he did it. Adam really appreciates what the boys did for him. Farley and Kip are welcome at our house anytime. I'll be happy to tell him as soon as he starts talking to me again. I've missed a lot of events in his life. I think the science fair was the last straw. All you can do is keep trying and hope for the best. Believe me I speak from experience. I find it hard to believe that you have trouble with your kids. Kid. Singular. Adam. He's still coping with his father's death. I'm sorry about that. Car accident, a year ago. My husband died instantly and for some reason I was spared. And your son's in a wheelchair? Yes. I'm sorry. Adam just feels so helpless with what's happened to him he's just shut everybody and everything out. He doesn't want to do any of the things we used to do. He used to cook us dinner one night a week. It was a family event for us. That's all gone now. All you can do is wait and hope that he'll eventually open himself up to life again. You move on as best you can, in some ways you can't. May I suggest something? Please. Talk to somebody. It doesn't have to be a professional listener. But you should have somebody to talk to about what you're going through. I'm not very good with talking about my feelings. Nobody is, it hurts. But sometimes it's the only thing that'll help ease the pain. So, find somebody. Thank you. I see you still wear yours. It's tough letting go. Tell me about it. Mr. Morgan... Charles, please. Charles. Remember, Farley wouldn't be so angry if he didn't love you. I suppose you're right. And you can call me anytime. Thank you. Hey, Farley. What? I won two free tickets on the radio this morning to paintball extreme. You wanna come? Paintball is lame. I, I thought you said you liked paintball. Maybe last year, not anymore. Well, I talked to a bunch of kids about raising money to get Adam's chair, still sure you don't wanna help? Man, you are full of lame ideas today, aren't ya? Lame ideas. No, dude, this is really gonna help him out. Why don't you go talk to Mr. Frost, he's your new buddy. Why do I have to choose between the two of you? Why can't I just work with Mr. Frost and hang out with you? Because I don't like him and friends are supposed to agree on things. Yeah, like paintball not being lame? You're like a one-way street, man. You just snap your fingers and expect me to jump? You know what? I don't care, do whatever you want, man. Fine, I don't care! Just, we'll do it without you! Hey, I thought you might like some company. Thanks. So how you doin' on that ramp? You were right. With a rolling start I can go right up it. Kipling's poem about the dog's in there. I thought you might like to have it. Thanks, Farley. Um, what was its name again? "The Power of the Dog". Right, um, I'll get it back to you as soon as I can. Oh, no hurry, I know that poem by heart. "Brothers and sisters, I bid you beware of giving your heart to a dog to tear. "Buy a pup and your money will buy, love unflinching, I cannot lie. But, but then later, it gets really sad. About when your dog gets old and dies. "The spirit that answers to your every mood, is gone. "Wherever it goes. For good. "You will discover how much you care, "and will give your heart for the dog to tear. That's really nice, Farley, I've never had a dog before. But I think I know what he's saying. Yeah, well I gotta run. I just wanted to drop the book off. I'll catch ya later. Hey, um, maybe do you wanna come over for dinner sometime? I don't think your mom wants me at your house. Okay. I don't think she'd mind though. I'm a bad influence. Just ask her. All right. See ya. Gimme the ball. Come on. Ready? Put the ball down. Put the ball down. Ready? Ready? Oh, nice catch, buddy. Over here. Over here. Whaddya doin? Whaddya doin? How are ya, Kippy? Jeannie. Hi, it's Charles Morgan. Oh, hi. How are you? I'm, I'm well thank you. Um, how are you? I'm fine, thanks. Great, I, I was hoping to take you up on that offer to talk. Sure, it would have to be after the school day. That would be great. I have some time tomorrow afternoon. I could possibly come by after your last class? That could work. Why don't you meet me in the science room? Great. No, absolutely. Great, looking forward to it. Thank you. See you then. Bye, Charles. Bye. Oh, looks good. What are you raising money for? Um, it is for a special needs student from another school. Oh, good for you. Adam, would you like a chocolate muffin? Sure. I'll take one of those. Sure. What's the damage? Uh, five dollars. Whoa. It's a good thing we're not buying a dozen. Well, what goes around comes around, Mrs. Claymore. Thank you, Steven. You're welcome. I'll hold onto it for ya. See ya. Bye. Um, Mr. Morgan... Five minutes of your time would be really cool. All right. It has to do with Mrs. Claymore's son, Adam. Oh yes, she told me about you boys building that ramp for her son Adam. Did Farley really help you with that? Well, we were kinda forced by Mr. Frost, but once we started it felt really good to help out. Well, that's very impressive, Steve. What can I do to help you? Well, um, we're trying to raise money to get one of these amazing chairs for Adam Claymore. Uh, this is my business plan. Hmmm. That's terrific. Getting a company to match funds. That's uh, that's very smart. I was hoping you'd know of some company that would be open to helping us. Not that I'm trying to put the bite on you, Mr. Morgan. You didn't, I put the bite on myself, okay. Awesome. Who's the adult handling the business end? Mr. Frost. Well, tell Mr. Frost to give me a call and we'll work out all the details. Awesome. Is uh, is Farley helping you with this as well? To be honest with you he's not really talking to me. Yeah, join the club. He says the guy's working as a janitor over at Riverbrook. I know, Farley told me when he sent the prints. Okay, what is it you want me to see? This looks like any old fingerprint to me. You're the expert, Neil. Do you have the prints up on screen? Okay hang on a minute. Now zoom in on them. Are those words? That's right, it looks like the kid pulled on over on ya. No, no I don't think the kid set me up. I think I found the real Santa Claus. The mystery Santa Claus has been visiting malls all over the state, spreading his message about giving, and the people are responding in droves. Videotape shot last night at this mall, is being broadcast all over the world. This mystery Santa is changing the way we think about Christmas. I say mystery because no one knows who this man is. Once again, his message of giving rather than receiving has become so popular, that department store Santas across the country are being instructed to use the same approach. Tune in tomorrow when I reveal the identity of the mystery Santa. This is Eric Simms, reporting for WALQ. Please be bluffing. Krissy Krissy Krissy Krissy Krissy Krissy!!! AHHHHH! That's, uh, not good. Okay... KRIS!!! Oh boy!!! I can't believe you know how to add and subtract numbers with just a pen. Well it's something new. Ho, ho, ho! Yes, well okay. Factoring in the money we have coming in, divided by the amount of time we have left. Right, right, right. But, but don't forget the wheelchair folks are cutting us a deal. So knock 25% off the original cost. Oh, we're still $3,800 short. Oh... But that's better than we were doing yesterday. Yeah, the trouble is we're not playing horseshoes. You're not giving up, are you? No way. You kidding me, I just got my mojo working. Okay, so what are you gonna do next? Another bake sale? Well half the kids in this school are on sugar shock, so... Oh wait, um, car wash. I could get that organized in an hour. That'd be great, go for it! All right. I loved Kipling's poem. The dude could write. Do you think you're risking your heart, as Kipling put it? Loving a dog, and knowing they have a short life. I think there's a risk of hurt whenever you love someone. Yeah, I guess we've both learned that. I guess we did. Hey, Adam. Hey, you know I saw an amazing thing on television the other night. A Santa in a mall. And in every picture they took of him, he looked different. Yeah, I saw that too. Do you think he's the real Santa? I wouldn't be surprised. So you think Santa exists? I believe he exists if you want him to exist. Whenever you do something special for someone you love, that's saying that you believe in Santa Claus. But I don't have very much money. You don't need to buy anything. You only need to give something of yourself. Giving your love. It's the greatest gift of all. See ya later. Oh, car was... Hey, oh car wa... Aaahhh... Car was... aw, come on. We haven't had a car in two hours. Well it's gonna rain later on in the week and maybe people don't want to wash their cars if it's gonna rain later. Well, I'll catch you later. Where are you going? To see a man. He went to see a man about what? My question exactly. Where have you been? Uh, okay. A cheque for $3,800. That should put us over the top. You sold your drums. I'll get some more someday. I want you to hear this. We wish you a Merry Christmas! What's that mean? It means you done good, kid. You done real good. Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! He's much better at it than I am. Adam? Adam? Honey, what happened? I tried to make you a Christmas dinner, but everything fell out of the cabinet. I'm sorry, mom, I'm so sorry. It's okay. You tried to make me Christmas dinner? Yes, and now it's all ruined. I can't do anything right. It's perfectly all right. It's wonderfully all right. It's the most wonderful present anyone's ever given me. I love you, mom. I love you too, sweetheart. Merry Christmas. We wish you a Merry Christmas! We'll make it together okay? Okay. Okay. Two down, and twenty-four hours until the finish. I'll miss you too. So many great memories to tuck away. Don't ever forget them. And Farley, don't you let him. Enjoy those memories. But don't let them consume you. Life. What a wonderful word. Life is for the living. So promise me you both, will make room in your heart for new memories. Now my darlings, know that I love you. And know that love, should never be a solitary act. It's for sharing. So please, share it with each other. Farley, I uh, I want you to give me something for Christmas. But it's Christmas Eve, there's no time to buy anything. You don't have to buy anything. I want ya to do something. I want you to give me a second chance. Dad... Oh, no, no. I have done so many wrong things this year. When we lost your mother, I was lost, Farley, I was lost. I ran to what I knew best, I, I, I, went to my work. And that was unfair. It's okay. NO. It's not okay. I'm gonna make it okay though. From now on, I promise. Well I was acting like a jerk too. It happens when you're angry. And you can't show it, huh? I think you were as lost as I was. We know what to do now, huh? We know what to do. Quietly now. Ready? Oh shoot. Hope nobody heard that. It's supposed to be a surprise. Thank you. Oh come on, Farley. Show up. Hey um, you're here from TV right? You recognize me. Well no, but I see you have a camera person and a satellite truck so I figured. Are you here for one of those feel good Christmas Eve stories? Uh, no. We got a hot tip that our mystery Santa Claus might be making an appearance here tonight. Cool. Hey, all right. This is what, this is what we're gonna do. Okay. The Mobius will be here any minute. But in the mean time, this is what we're gonna do. It was cold enough to freeze the hot springs in Georgia. Dashing through the snow... What's that? Carolers. They sound close enough to be right out front. Why don't we go check it out? Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh. Hey, what is all this? Where's my ramp? Steve has an announcement to make. Adam, all these dudes, all these people, have worked really hard in order to make this happen. You know those stairs that you can't get up? Yeah. Well now you'll be able to. Adam, look. See that awesome chair? Yeah. That's for you. Watch this. Oh my goodness! So cool! There's no sign of Farley and it's almost midnight. Maybe you better call Constance. Oh, I suppose I should. Merry Christmas, dude. Merry Christmas, Farley. You need him more than I do. You mean you're giving me Kip? You have to come and visit all the time! I will. I'm proud of you, son. Your mom would be too. I love you, Kip. We wish you a Merry Christmas! Ha ha ha ha! Job security. Thank you all so much, everybody! I don't know what to say except Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Won't you all stay a while? Well uh, if Adam shows me how those new wheels work. This is so cool! Thanks so much, Steve. No problem, buddy, glad you like it. You're the best! Sweetheart. Thank you all so much. Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho! I know it's last minute but, do you have plans for Christmas dinner? Well uh, nothing that can't be cancelled. Great. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Congratulations. As much as it pains me, you have quite literally saved Christmas. Let me see the footage. Pulitzer here I come. NO!!! Where is it? Give me that! On behalf of the board, I am required to inform you that your contract has been renewed. Inpropretuity. That means forever and ever. I know what it means. You seem disappointed. When you grow up, you learn to live with disappointment. It's the pony. Please. My entire life is not defined by something that did not happen when I was seven years old. So you don't want a white Christmas? What? It never snows here. It did in 1964, so it can again. His name is White Christmas. I'm sorry it took so long. Oh!!!!! Oh he so beau... Oooohhhhhh!!!! Thank you so much! Oh he's, oh he's so beautiful! Ooohhh!!!!! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Santa! Merry Christmas, everybody! Oooohhhh. Oh you're so beautiful. Oh, I'm so happy! I always wanted a pony! Look! Are you seeing that? Look! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, ho, ho, ho! Look, Sweetheart. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
