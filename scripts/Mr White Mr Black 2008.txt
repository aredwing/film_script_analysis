He is Kishan, my brother. Where does he live? Here in Goa. Even I will in Goa? - Is it? Yes, what is his address? Goa village. Is that so? Can you see the street from here? - Yes. Take a right from there. Take a left from there. You'll get a circle there. Take two to four rounds of that.. .. circle, then ask anybody, they'll tell you about him. They'll tell you about him. Is that clear? Take it, sir. There is no deal in love. Where will I search for my Kishan now? Hey run! Hey brother! Whose dog is this, brother? Hey brother! Somebody help me! I am very scared of dogs! Open! Open. Kohl eyed. Kohl eyed.. Hey you! How can you directly come in like that? Shall I get down? Hey! Wait there! The meter is running. Don't leave. We got down.. Brother, there is a dog. If that dog had pulled my wraparound, I would've.. .. got embarrassed in public. I found you, felt like I found God. Don't address me as God, I am Tulsi. Who are you? I am Gopi. I am looking for him. Do you know him? You are looking for him? Who doesn't know him? He is famous all over India. By the way, who is he? What? I meant.. nobody has the guts to say who he is. Yes. - He is our.. Kishan.. - Yes, Kiran. - Kishan. Are you deaf? I told the same thing, Kishan. Kishan. I'll call him right away. 922.. Hey Kishan.. where are you? Where are you? Brother, let me talk to him. Where? Where? There! Okay, one minute.. one minute.. Your brother is here. Give it to me. Here, talk to him. Hello! Where did you say you are? I'll get him there right away. We've reached. We've reached. Come, come. Meet your brother. Radhe, come. I am Gopi, Tulsi. - The same.. understand my feelings. Do you see this building? But, that's a hut. You call that a building in English. There is a ground floor on the first floor. There is a terrace on top of that. Your brother Akash must be there. Kishan. - The same.. are you nuts? Hey, why are you taking this bag along with you? First, go and meet your brother. You first go and meet your brother. Give this bag to this brother. Come on, go and meet your brother. Go. Go. Hurry up. Kishan! There is water.. be careful. You'll get wet. Hey Kishan! Tulsi, here.. Hey thief! Thief! Police! Brother, I've come all the way from Hoshiarpur.. .. searching for my brother. Somebody stole my bag. Who was he? Tulsi. That thief stole my bag. Whose photograph is this? I've come in search of him. So, is he Tulsi? He is Kishan. Then who is Tulsi. Tulsi is the thief. Then who is he? Sir, I've come all the way from Hoshiarpur to take him. Are you searching for him or the thief? I'll search for him and you should search for the thief, right? Why are you looking for him? To take him back to Hoshiarpur. So, he is a run-away from Hoshiarpur. He didn't run away from Hoshiarpur, but walked.. .. I came running behind him. Tell me one thing, all together how many men ran away? Total? There was only one.. that Tulsi. And you are looking for him? I am searching this guy, Kishan. And Tulsi? He ran away with my luggage, right? That thief! This is a police station and not the alleys of the village to.. .. play hide and seek. You first decide whom are you looking for. You are very confused and confusing me too. Decide whether you have to look for Tulsi or this Kishan! Babu.. Police! Hey! Open the coat! Oh no! Shit! If I press a button, you all will shatter to pieces with me. Why do you want to die? Surrender yourself.. .. I will appeal to the court to reduce your punishment. I don't want forgiveness. Leave. Look Babu, don't take a wrong step. Inspector, you can't convince me. Please, don't press the button. We will do as per your wishes. Look, I'll keep this gun down. Let them all leave from here. Okay? Okay, I am keeping it. Relax. Relax. Move out from here! Out! Come on! Get out! This is mine, this is Chhoti's, and.. This.. This is yours, this is mine, and this.. Chhoti's. Okay. It means, Chhoti's share equals ours. Your sister, Divya is very lucky. You fool, idiot, isn't she your sister too? Look dude, I was not destined to go to school. I had a dream that I would educate Divya. I am trying to fulfill that. What difference does it make if.. .. I am doing some swindling for her? I am not doing any robbery, murder or fighting with anyone. Just a bit of swindling. That is acceptable. Look, I was telling the truth. The bell rang. Hey Divya! You will live a very long life. I was just talking about you. Do you have any problem? Brother, this is London. Everything is fine. I know. I know. Listen, I've deposited your fees money in the bank. Manager said he would transfer it. Strange, isn't it? Earlier men used to get transferred and.. .. nowadays it is money. Our country has progressed. Brother, will you continue to talk about money or.. .. talk about yourself too? Dear, what do I tell you about myself? If you insist, let me tell you. I've become a rich man here. You remember people used.. .. to buy gold chains in the village.. I buy hotel chains here. That's great, brother. Thank you. Listen, I hope you don't have any problem with the food in the hostel? If you have so, then tell me. I'll send a lunch box from here. Now enough, brother. I am very proud of you. Somebody has to learn from you to see dreams and fulfill them. Enough of talks now. Concentrate on studies, okay? Okay brother, take care. Bye. Bye. What is it? Kishan, there is a limit for everything. Hotel chains? Sometimes we don't have enough of money.. .. to buy a cycle chain, you are talking about hotel chains? Somebody has to learn how to charade from you. Ladla! Don Ladla! We've put him to rest. What can he do when faced with Teenie, Meenie and Zeenie? At the most, he'll watch a Hindi movie and weep in his mother's lap. Your values and principles can't provide a day's meal, Ravi. What has your values and principles, that you're willing to.. .. risk your life for, provided you with? A low-wage cop's job, an ordinary apartment.. .. a pair of khaki uniforms, and a govt. jeep. Look! Look at me! This is the same me and this is the same you. We've both started off from this same footpath. But look at where you stayed behind and look at where I've reached. Today, I own buildings, properties, bank balance.. .. bungalows, cars, what do you have? I have my mother with me. To hell with his mom! I've been watching this movie only till this scene.. .. for the past 5 years. Whenever the mom's dialogue comes, he freezes the screen. How much more? Mom! Son! - Mom! Son, freshen up fast, I've cooked a sweet dish for you. No, mother. Before that I want to share a good news with you. Have you brought home my daughter-in-law? No, mom. It's a much bigger good news. Today, your son has become a don, mother. I'm don. - Really?! 'I'm don, I'm don. ' 'I'm.. I'm.. I'm don. ' Mother! You'll come back, won't you, mother? You'll feed me sweetmeats with your own hands, won't you? Don! Don! Don! We've traced the girls. We've received information that.. .. they're in Goa. I love the beach. I love the sand. I love the beauty. I love the pain. I love the rain. From here to there. The ocean stretches. The ocean.. A fire burns somewhere within my heart. It's a wet climate, my love is young. My fantasies are full of fun. From here to there. From here to there. The ocean stretches. The ocean.. The ocean.. The ocean.. I love the beach. I love the sand. I love the beauty. I love the pain.

Babu, is your stomach alright? - Yes. Then why are you making such noises? Those girls, pal.. - Yeah! Those girls.. Hey! Hey! Catch it! Catch it! Come here! Are you drunk? - No! What are you doing with him, Babu? I was taking him to brother Kishan. Do you know he stole again, yesterday? You should be ashamed, Hari! You've made Kishan's life hell. He can't meet anybody. Everybody assumes him to be you. Obviously they'll assume so. We're like Ram and Shyam, the twins. By the way, do you have a twin sister? Sorry! - Hold this! Keep this money and get out of this locality. Because of you, Kishan avoids meeting dad. Mom and dad have passed away. I'm talking about my dad! I don't have a problem. C'mon, let's meet your dad. It's the alcohol talking. Babu, the farther he stays from me.. .. the closer will Kishan be to me. Why did you tell her that I'm drunk? Kishan, don't fool around with this girl. Anuradha is such an innocent girl and you're fooling her.. .. by cooking up stories about twins. I'm not fooling her, pal. She had once seen me in this condition. I got scared. I told her that I've a twin brother. Since then, Kishan has to pretend to be Hari. If I tell her the truth, then she'll leave me. Fine! Then just handover 50% of the money that she gave you. You..! It's pretty small. Here's a big one. Very good! Pass it! Pass! Hey! Shell out the money. Why are you shouting? What's the balance? The old due. - Then add this to it and collect it later. But where will I search for you? Hey! You don't have to search for me. Even the kids know me. Am I knew here? What nonsense are you talking? Sir, does everybody out here know you? - What is it? Do you know him? Who are you? Look, I am what I am. You can assu me whatever you want to. But please keep him in mind. I've come to take him and I'll surely take him back. He was a wrestler! A wrestler! The only thing I don't understand is that.. .. why someone outside Goa's looking for you? Tell me something, have I fooled anybody outside Goa? No! - Then where has he sprung up from? You should have looked at him. He was looking like a bull from Jaffrabad. With a staff in his hand and wearing a wraparound.. .. he looked like an illiterate villager. Are you sure it was my photo? I can identify your photo even with my eyes closed. I hope it wasn't Hari's photo. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, I'm late. - Did I say anything? You didn't but then it's my duty to explain myself. Here, I was after this. Take it. Anu, how many times have I told you not to give money to Hari? By giving him money, you're not.. .. going to mend his ways, are you? He'll not change. He's a stain. He's like a birthmark. He's stuck to my body. He's like my shadow. I know. I can understand your problem. You brothers are so different from each other. He doesn't have any manners, and.. .. you're the epitome of good manners. Thanks, Anu. You're the only one who understands my problem. Thanks. Thank you. What did he say? Staff, wraparound, bull. Oh hell! Brother! - Mr. White. Hey dhoti! - Mr. Black Stop! Stop! - I'm not going to stop! - I'm Gopi! My Kishan is again into some problem! Brother Kishan, listen to me!

Hey brother! It's my wraparound. It's mine! Hey! A mermaid! Please help! Please rescue me from these goons. Come! I'll help you! What happened, brother? Hey you! Run for your lives! It took just four slaps to get rid of them. Thanks! - What? - Thank you. Ok. Can you please return my honour? What?! - My wraparound. Sorry, can you drop me home for that? Drop you home? - Please! - Ok. Where have you brought me? Is this your house or a hotel? This is my house. You don't seem to be a native of Goa. Have you come here looking for ajob? I've.. I've come to look for you. He's not here. He must've gone to Mumbai. To try in the movies. No, no. He's very much here. I've enquired. But I couldn't find his address. Then will you search for him with this photo? - Yes! By the way, where are you put up? Actually I.. nowhere. I'm a stranger in this city. Then listen to me. You're going to stay in this hotel. I'll tell the manager. No, no. You've treated me so well. Thank you very much for that. Moreover, I can't be a.. .. burden on you just a few minutes after knowing you. Oh c'mon!

Have a seat! Sit! - Ok. Be comfortable. - Ok, sir. I keep hearing about your twin brother's antics from Anuradha - Yes. That's the reason I cracked the joke. Hello! - Hello, this is Brown here. Tell me, inspector. What made you think of me? My wife has made purchases worth Rs. 5 lakhs from your shop. Yes, absolutely. And she didn't pay. - I didn't ask either. That's your big-heartedness. But business is business. I'll send you the Rs. 5 lakh in two days. Cash. No problem. Your dad's moustache is too big. Did you see, Kishan? - Yes! A cop's job, a govt. salary. - I see. And royal tastes. His wife had made purchases worth Rs. 5 lakhs. And now my friend wants to settle the account in cash. It's very obvious that he must've received a huge bribe. All corrupt souls!

Then what does he do? - He bears the punishment for his misdeeds. Then where's he? - That's yourjob to find out. We're going to take him along. - That means I've to leave him. Absolutely! Firstly, he's innocent and secondly, he's my son-in-law. If you're going to take him then who's going to be in the lock-up. Where will I get that Hari? Uncle, are you the cop or us? Have you caught the wrong guy or us? Has the burglary happened in your house or ours? Will you nab the real thief or us? Ms. Tania! - What is it now? Hasn't the manager told you that.. Yes, he did tell me that you don't want to meet me. But I wanted to meet you before leaving. - Why? Is there anything left to say? No, Tania. You're misunderstanding me. If I'd told you something wrong in my drunken stupor, last night.. .. then kindly forgive me for that. I can never misbehave with you. It's just that I couldn't bear to see you in that state. Liquor is not the cure for loneliness, Ms. Tania. In fact, liquor makes one all the more lonely. Those who encourage you to succumb to liquor.. .. aren't your friends but your enemies. You've everything by God's grace. God forbid, if you lose it all in the future.. .. then these friends of yours won't be there with you either. Learn to identify true friends, Ms. Tania. I'll take your leave now. Gopi! - Yes? Where are you going? - Back to my village. Back to your village? But you've promised somebody. I'll seek forgiveness from God. Who all will you seek forgiveness from? You were apologising to me sometime back.. .. now you're even going to apologise to God. What to do, madam? I'm in a fix. How can the one who helps others find the right path.. .. be in a fix himself? Gopi, you're not the one who's trapped. It's me. What? - In your simplicity. In your honesty. In your love. Pappu has passed his exams! Kishan! Pappu has passed his exams! I've tracked down the girls. They are staying in GK resort. Mind blowing! C'mon! Hello! May I help you, sir? Yes. - I need a room. Single or double? - Two singles. Why don't you take a double? - Who needs the room? You, sir. - Who's paying? You, sir. Then why are you giving me free advice? Open your register. - How long will you be staying, sir? Normally we don't wait for more than a second. But sometimes we've to go in for 7 years. Stay back! He meant stay back. - Yes. You can leave that area blank. Right, sir. - Thank you. Thank you! - Thank you. Come along, idiot. - Please attend the counter. I'll teach you a lesson or two. 'White! Mr. White!' Kishan. - Yes. - Huh! Is it? Babu! - Yes? Don't come in between. Go! Kishan! Hey Kishan! Please wait! Wait! Where do I hide from this wrestler? He's after my life! Hey Kishan! I know you're here. Look.. Look Kishan, please come out wherever you are. I've come to take you back. I should've kept a dog! Had I kept a dog then you wouldn't have been able to catch me. Police! Police! - There's a small station in the village. You can find the cops there. Hey wrestler, please leave me! Please! Even if I lose my wraparound, this time I'll surely take you along. Why are you after me? I'm not after you. Your dad was after my dad. To find out the truth about you. What rubbish are you talking? My dad has my complete address. And how did you and your dad come into this? Come along with me to Hoshiarpur. I'll tell you everything there. By the way, what's the matter? It's a 25 year old case. - Case? What case? Court case. Which court? - Hoshiarpur court. But how am I concerned with a case between two fathers. Because you're his only heir, brother. Heir? - Yes. What am I getting? - Land. How much will it be worth? - Rs. 25000! A land worth Rs. 25000? Do you expect me to bring it down here? That's why I'm taking you there. You've to come along with me. No, I'm not coming. - You have to. Are you trying to use force? Are you a cop? Do you have a warrant? Am I your father's property? Hey! What are you doing?! Are you going to ask me for a warrant, Kishan? I'm a devotee of Lord Hanuman. He had set fire to Lanka without a warrant. He had lifted the Drona hill without a warrant. You must hardly be weighing I'll carry you up to Hoshiarpur in my palm. I swear on Lord Ram! Wrestler! Wrestler! - Are you coming along with me? Pack your bags and be ready. I'll return soon. See you! The rascal is after my life! You people are having fun, isn't it? Go out, have a drink and come back. And see what I do to them. Ma'am, this is ruby. Original! Ruby! Very good! No, no! Pack this! - No! No! Can I show you something in gold? Gold?! Gold! - No, no! Where? Where is the gold? - Yeah. I will show you. - Bring it.. Bring it! Get the gold! Get it! Car! Mom, I want the car.. No more cars! You want the car? Take it. Hey, madam. Pack this also - No, no! Where's the gold? - No, no! Why's he saying no? - Because my BP's shooting.. .. up on thinking of the bill. My wife has so much gold that if she walks the street.. .. wearing all her gold then she would look like a mobile goldmine.. Let it be! Let it be! Pack all this! He'll settle the bills. Won't you? Won't you? Look, he agreed. Oh good Lord! There's Complan for growing kids.. .. but what plan is there for growing bills. What are you doing here, dancer? I am where you are. Hey macho man! - Sexy bomb! I like it! Hey do you come here daily? No. By the way, if you invite me, I'll come whenever you.. .. want me to. Which band do you play for? - How does it matter? I can play it on anybody. How about you? As long as somebody doesn't play it on you.. .. you'll never understand. But you're able to understand, darling. Why have you come here? The same reason for which you've come here. Do you think you're Romeo? Had you been Juliet, then I would've been Romeo. But it would've been better had you been Radha.. .. because I'm Kishan. And I'm Gopi. - You?! Is this a wrestling ring.. .. what are you doing here? I don't like him. Ladies, I'm Gopal Murlimanohar from Hoshiarpur. How long are you going to be here? As long as you're here. I'll leave when you leave. What are you saying? Should I wrestle with you or have fun with them. Fun? Right! Fun?! Yeah, let's have fun. - Yeah!.. C'mon, let's go. - Hey go! I'm Gopi. He's not going with you! He's going to come with me to Hoshiarpur. C'mon, leave me! To hell with your Hoshiarpur! What are you acting smart for! Have you gone crazy? You've started fighting with me on meeting girls. Look, girls, you can flirt with him as much as you want to.. .. but at the end of the day he's going with me to Hoshiarpur.. .. I've promised your dad. Kishan! Brother Kishan! Oh! This is fun! I'm scared of that staff wielding guy who keeps.. .. stalking me. I think his mother must've sung.. .. songs from horror movies to him instead of lullabies. I am fed up of this guy. Hello, Mr. Kishan! - You?! Village! - Ghost! Kishan! Kishan! Where are you?! Goddamn! This guy is troubling me! He doesn't even let me visit.. .. the toilet in peace. On one hand these girls are troubling me for diamonds.. and on the other hand he stands in my path like an RTO officer. Don't you have anything better to do? You're standing out here like a statue! You think I am a part of a herd that chase me with a staff? If you keep scaring me with that staff of yours then.. .. I'll break it one day. I'm not going to Hoshiarpur for Rs. 25000. I'm not going to leave behind millions for dimes. Have I gone crazy? Am I that stupid? Do one thing, you keep that land for yourself. From me to you. Thank me for it and leave. Don't eat my brains! I would've eaten your brains, if you had them. If you had brains then you would've celebrated your.. .. father's victory. You would've come.. .. with me to Hoshiarpur and chosen your piece of land. You would've erected a memorial for your dad. What kind of a son are you? Why are you getting so sentimental about my dad? It's better for me to go along with you to Hoshiarpur.. .. rather than have you stalking me all day. Really?! Will you come with me to Hoshiarpur? You arrange for the tickets and I'll pack my bags. Tickets? We'll go to Bombay by bus and from there.. .. we'll take a train to Hoshiarpur. No! Bus and trains? No! We'll take a flight from here to Delhi. Rs. 10000. - 10000?! Yes. From there, AC train to Ambala. Rs. 5000. From there a bus.. I won't travel in a bus. We'll hire an AC car. At the rate of Rs. 10 per km. It'll be Rs. 6000. How much? - 21000 to go and 21000 to come. Arrange for that money and I'll come along.. I don't have that much money?! What?! You don't have money? -No. Then how'll I come to Hoshiarpur? Who promised dad? - I. Who vowed to take me to Hoshiarpur? - I. Then who'll arrange for the money? - I. - Then?! Arrange the money and I will come to Hoshiarpur. If I arrange the money you'll come to Hoshiarpur with me? Definitely.. - Swear on me. I promise that you arrange for the money.. .. and I'll go along with you to Hoshiarpur. Ok. I'll go. How can you escape so easily! And you also promise that you'll not show me your face.. .. or stalk me till you arrange for the money. Yes, I promise not to stalk you or show my face. Yeah baby! - Kishan! - What is it? Kishan! Kishan! The mermaids are bathing. So should I apply soap on them? I meant the girls. - Which girls? The girls who were bathing. - What! Where are they? In the swimming pool. - Mind blowing! We'll go their to swim and while swimming we'll Befriend them and ask them where the diamonds are. And you think they'll tell you? - Yes. They'll beat you to pulp. If they're swimming in the pool then we'll clean up their room.. .. by then. - Yes. - Find out their room no. - Ok. Okey. Yes! I'll ask them right away! Idiot! Why will you go and ask them! Ask the waiter. Take it! Pass it on! - Take it! Here! C'mon! Pass it here! C'mon! C'mon! Get it! - I'll get it! Hey! Kishan! Why don't you be the elder brother and.. .. seek one of their hands in marriage for me. Why? - That way we can ask them to give us the diamonds as dowry. Shut up! You just keep on blabbering. Kishan! Listen to me! Oh I broke it! O my God! Where have they gone man! Hey! Move aside! What kind of a bat is this! Why are you breaking that TV? They could've hidden it in the TV. Then couldn't you switch on the TV and see. Donkey. - Sorry! Sorry! That's the way! I like it! No! No! I don't like it! Oh my God! I've to renovate that entire room. You'll have to pay another In rupees? - Right, sir. Are you ok, sir? - No, man! I wasn't even in the room. I don't even know who broke it. But it's your room, sir. - No! It's your room. You can keep it. Right, sir. But it's in your name. And the keys are with you. The one who has the keys has to pay the fine.? C'mon, hurry up! Get dressed up. I'm sure that even when the don comes he won't find us or the diamonds. Oh the diamonds. Where are the diamonds? It's in the locker, idiot! C'mon now, hurry up. - Locker! Locker! Ask the kid to keep quiet, I'm not able to think. Right away! I want to play now. It's mine! No, dear. We can keep it away for now. No, it's mine. It's mine. Shut up! Hey bandmaster! I'll make her dance to my tunes! Kid, what's your dad's room no.? - Ok! .. I'll play with the police vehicles. There's a police siren in that! We will scare people with this. Who is that? Shit!- Hurry! Oh God! - Why did the three of us leave the locker and come here? C'mon! The bandmaster! Shit! Gopi! Brother Gopi! What are you turning your face away for? Am I naked? You had made me promise that I shouldn't show you my.. .. face until I get the tickets. Don't bother about that, I've got the tickets. Here, look. - Really? Have I ever lied? Moreover, even if you had taken the money.. .. no one would've given you flight tickets. - Yes? That Anuradha is coming along with me. Actually she hasn't seen a Goa without the sea. If you want you can bring Tania along. Really? - Yes. That'll be great, brother. - Great? But we'll spend our honeymoon here in Goa. Not in Hoshiarpur. You're truly like Lord Krishna. Naughty and romantic. It's paining! - Forgive me. Thank you. You can praise me later. I'm in a hurry now. Let's go. I'm all set. C'mon! Let's go! Where did the bandmaster go? We must catch him. - Yes we should. - Yes, of course. Don, my fate is so bad! Everybody has to die someday including me. But just see in how many different ways one can die. By train accidents, road accidents, plane crash. You know? Some drown in a ship, some drown in liquor. Some are poisoned to death. TB, malaria, AIDS, etc. There's no dignity in their death. Dignity is there in my death. I'm going to die in the hands of a don. Don! A don who's going to die a dog's death at the hands of.. .. the police. I meant, instead of dying a dog's death at the hands.. .. of the police, he should directly be bitten by dogs. Who's the dog? - There's neither a mirror to show you.. .. nor is there any time. But Don, I've a final wish before I die. Please fulfill it. What's the last wish? Mother used to tell me.. Mother? Mother. - Mother? Mother used to tell me that if there's no way out then.. .. we should watch a movie at a nearby theatre.. .. then we would surely find a way. And there is no theatre nearby. And you don't have a VCR.. But I only have tragic movies.. I don't want to die laughing anyway. If I cry by seeing those movies.. .. my heart will be rid of all the burden. Maybe even the body would lighten. You wouldn't have a difficulty lifting me up. Don, will you show me the film? It's my mother's last wish.. Mother! The last film.. Don't cry! Switch on the TV.. Play a nice classic movie. Play a nice old classic movie. You're so nice. You're so innocent. You're so lovely. O mother! O Mother! You're so nice. You're so innocent. You're so lovely. O mother! O Mother! This world.. Mr. Don! You're crying! I'm leaving. No! Where are you going? To stop those tears. They flow such that there's no line or valve behind them. There's nothing to stop them. Oh God! I've even given up my plumber's job. I'm going to look for a mother for you, don. Where will you get her from? - I'll find her, don. I'll get you my mother. I'm going to die. Who'll take care of my mother? You're the only one, don. Only you. Take good care of my mother, don. - Mother! I'm going! - Mother! Take good care of my mother, don. - Mother! Mother! Mother! I'm saved! - You've driven me crazy.. Babu - You've driven me crazy.. You've driven me crazy.. - Babu. Aren't you ashamed, naked guy! I'm dying at the don's hand and you're talking a bath out here. Get out! Bring all of them to the airport. In the meanwhile, I'll get the boarding pass. C'mon! - Ok. Who's this? - It's me, brother. How are you? - I am fine. I had something to tell you. - Yes, tell me. - I've chosen a guy. A really nice guy. I want you to meet him. Yes, I do have to meet him. I'm bringing him and his dad. Even I want to show him.. .. that my brother is a big businessman too. Very good! Very good! When are you coming? - What do you mean when? I'm calling from the airport.. I'm coming right now. Mr. Black. Brother Gopi, please save me.. What's this new story now? Brother Gopi, I have a sister who studies abroad. Whatever I do, I do it for her, brother Gopi. She is getting engaged. And they want to come here. Brother Gopi, they think that I am a rich person. That I have many hotels. But the truth is I have nothing. If the groom's family comes to know that I have nothing.. .. the engagement will break. Please save me. - Buddy, I understood everything. Brother Kishan, I understood everything. But you will come to Hoshiarpur with me.. .. once everything becomes fine, won't you? You have faith on me. I have complete faith in lord Hanuman. I'll try to do something. These two guys are here as well? Kishan. Hi. - Hi. They are here. - Who is where? Ladla. - Whose ladla? No body's dear one. Ladla is his name. And you know he is a don. A don. How would he harm you? And why would he do that? - Look, I don't have time.. .. to answer so many questions. He will kill me the moment he sees me. He will kill you? Why, Kishan? - Not Kishan, but Hari. Hari ran away with their diamonds. And these guys are chasing me. - Then tell those guys.. .. that you are not Hari, but you are Kishan. There's a lot of difference between.. .. saying something and proving something, Anu. Till I don't bring Hari in front of them, they will think.. .. that I am Hari and they will chase me. And you know I am Kishan. And I can't bring Hari here. No. - That's why they will kill Kishan.. .. assuming him to be Hari. What would happen finally? What would happen? - Finally what will happen is that.. .. Kishan will die in Hari's place in this diamond puzzle. And when Hari will be caught Kishan won't be there. Because they had already killed Kishan. - Yes. I hope you understand what I am saying. It's a bit confusing. - Hari's well-wisher! What are you explaining to her? Explain it to me. What! - Now I got it. Hari ran away with my diamonds. - Correct. Now you will hand over Hari to me. Or else in this hurry I might shoot you.. .. assuming you to be Hari. Will I get a chance? - What chance? What's the time now? - Where? In your watch, of course. It's 2 o'clock. - 2. - 2. He might have gone to Bali by now. - Bali? - Bali? Yes, it's his daily program. - What? He meets Kali at 1 o'clock. - Kali. - He goes to Bali at 2. - Bali. There he eats a rice plate at 3. I want to go to Bali. - Do I look like a travel agent? Let's do one thing. Let's go to the port. You can catch him there before he leaves this place. If he escapes to Bali you'd be left with empty hands. - No. I will go to Bali. - Thank you. I will go to Bali. I won't go bankrupt. C'mon! Be careful. Be careful. There's a gun in my hand. Be careful. - Yes. Yes, come. Walk faster or else the ship will leave. Is this is the right ship or you are pulling a fast one? You think I am pulling a fast one on you? What are you saying! He's there. - Who? Hari. Hari. He's there. Red cap and red jacket. - Red cap. Red jacket. I can see him. - He is his mother's favorite child. He's his mother's favorite child. Really! Stop. - Hey! I am here. I can do it for you. I am as good as three. Wait here. Stop. - You think I am a fool? - No. We will be here. You will go there. You will escape to Bali with your brother Hari. You wait here. We will go there. - Yes. Come. Come. - Be careful. Be careful. Ok. Hide your face. Down. Down. Whoever is there in the red coat will get Hari's death. Move aside. Something is definitely wrong. Freak! Nothing's wrong, Anu. I am here only, isn't it? See I am the owner of this hotel. But this owner will disown the ownership for a month. K.G. Resort will become G.K. Resort.. .. whose owners will be Gopi and Kishan. 'Hey Mr. Black!' 'Hey Mr. White. ' 'Hey Mr. White, Mr. Black!' I have been pushing around the suitcases since 25 years.. .. but I didn't get to wear a suit even once. And this stick-man came here half-naked.. .. but today he is roaming around like a big shot. How are you? - Brother. O God! Good to see you. Brother, he is Sid. - Sid, hi. - Hi, Sid. And he is Sid's dad, Mr. Vikrant Patel. Greetings. - It's alright. Very nice to have met you, Kishan. - Pleasure's all mine. Please meet my friends. Please, come. He's my partner, Mr. Gopi. - Greetings. How do you do, Mr. Gopi? What are you doing? Awesome. Awesome look. Very interesting. Stick. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - And she's Tanya, our employer. Hello there! - Employer? -Hello! - Means.. Its owner. - Owner. Yeah. - Actually Mr. Gopi and Tanya are, you know.. In love. - Yeah! Yeah! And she is Anuradha. She and I.. Actually she's my owner. Yeah. Shall we go now? Shall we? - Yeah.. Please come. Thank you. What is going on! You changed the hotel's name.. You even changed the owner's name. What's the matter, Roshan Lal? Tanya ma'am, you are corrupting your family business. Everything will be ruined. I mean there will be no credibility left. Why don't you understand that? Look, Roshan Lal. It would be far better if you don't bother.. .. to lecture me about family business and credibility, ok? Or else I will also have to lecture your wife.. .. about your relation with that Suzie girl. Should I, Roshan Lal? - Ma'am. Suzie. Gopi and Kishan are such good people. I am really happy. Two heartbeats of the same heart. One is Gopi and the other one is Kishan.

It is a great thing for this Indian heart to feel happy when.. .. our son or daughter is wed to a good Indian family. It's a great thing. It is the happiest moment of our life. I was confident, dad. After talking to Divya, one can.. .. definitely understand that she is from a royal family. Brother Gopi, the engagement ceremony was.. .. a super hit one. Yes, instead of wearing this suit, if I would've worn my.. .. loin cloth, then it would've looked grand and pomp. You.. Phone.. - Here. Who is it? Three of them? Okay, send them in. Journalists. Hello.. - Hello, sir. Hello, who are you? I am Khabri from Dopahri. I am Miss Sting from Twing channel. And I am from Daily Danga. Good. What made you come here?

Right now. When you were looking there and turned here.. .. you must've seen me. Come, sir. One minute. There is something wrong in this.. .. name plate of the resort. - Name plate? Not at all. How did it become GK from KG? The owner has changed so the name also changed. What are you saying? The owner has changed? - Yes. Who is the owner now? You? You both are owners of this resort? Why did he come here? - He used to wear a loin cloth.. .. and Mittal got you released from the jail. I was undergoing punishment because of your confusion. By the way you slowly digested that.. .. five hundred thousand rupees. Punishment? - Yes, this inspector is always confused. Shut up! There is no confusion today. If there isn't any confusion, why are you here? Did you forget the way to the police station? Or you have come here for the extortion money? Look, I am a very good citizen of this country and I will not.. .. encourage this kind of illegal activities. Extortion money? Yes. I am not here for the extortion money. I am here to investigate two things. Oh, tell me. How did the name of this resort change from KG to GK? Three journalists are missing from this place. Missing? But I.. - Newspaper is shut down?

Not three, but two journalists had come here. Both were girls. One named Khabri and other named Sting. There was a problem between both of them. Brother Gopi got angry and kicked them out of here. Since then they are missing. - Missing? - Yes. From where? - Here. I am saying the same thing. - Even I am saying the same thing. Then who is confused? - James.

C'mon move away from here. Hey, you do not recognise the owner! And on top of that you act smart! Hey, you may be the owner of your house, understood? If you talk too much then.. It seems some mad dog has bitten you! A mad dog has bitten me? - Yes. I will show you now. One minute. Hey, go.. get out! Fool, idiot! Tight slap! Wait till I make a bed roll out of you! Hey he's taking me somewhere! I'm the owner of this resort! Shut up! - I'm the owner of this resort! Whatever you are, I'll show you now! Can't you understand? You fool! G.K. Resorts!
