(CRASHING) (RUMBLING) (DOOR OPENS) - What's going on? - (JAKE) I think there was an earthquake. Don't be stupid. Since when do they have earthquakes in Battersea? (SARAH) on, my God. What? - What? What is it? - (SARAH) Must be a bomb. (GREG) Why would terrorists bomb here? Makes more sense than an earthquake. (CAR ALARM BLARING IN DISTANCE) Do you have a TV? Shit. That's my car. Wait. It could be dangerous out there. You've gotta be fucking kidding me. (CAR ALARM BLARING) (BEEPING) (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) (EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE) Oh, my God. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (DIALLING MOBILE PHONE) Turn on the TV. Nick, just do it. Just turn on the TV. I think there's been a plane crash. (BARKING) No, no, no, here. I can see smoke coming up from somewhere over by the park. Nick, just turn on the TV. (TYRES SCREECHING) (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO) Oh, shit. Foxy. Foxy? Foxy, there you are. Come on. Come here. What the hell is that? (FOXY BARKING) Foxy. Come back. Foxy. Foxy? (FOXY PANTING) Foxy, what is it? (BARKING) Foxy. What is it? (SHOUTS) Foxy! - (SLICES) - (DOG WHIMPERS) Foxy. (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) (HORNS HONKING) (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) (OVER RADIO) # You can look but don't touch desire (MAKING POPPING SOUNDS) # Your dreams are dust at dawn # And now you've got what you've been longing for # You don't want it any more # But this time # This time I cleared the dishwasher last night so your favourite mug's in the top cupboard on the left. Great, thanks. # But this time you've gone across that line # You don't know any reason she might have done this to me, do you? I'm sorry. - I just can't believe she did this to me. - Forget her, yeah? I mean, you're probably better off being on your own for a while. You're never on your own. You're always either with her or with me. Yeah. (CHARLIE SIGHS) (COUGHS) Would you mind putting your window down'? It's wafting fumes. (WINDOW WHIRRS) I've lost my deposit. You know that? Yeah. You've only told me about 50 times. Look, Charlie, relationships end. People change. You can't blame yourself. You must be the only person who still uses matches. - They're handy. - If you wanna burn down a house, maybe. Hey, and you know what? You know, I don't blame myself. I blame her. - I didn't change. Do I look like I changed? - No, you haven't, Charlie. No. No. (REPORTER OVER RADIO) Britain is on high alert... I'm still the same guy. I'm still loveable, do-it-all-for-his-friends Charlie, so... At this stage it's not clear what has happened, but reports tell us there has been a plane crash near Hyde Park in central London. We haven't been made aware of the size of the aircraft... You hearing this? - It may have been a military cargo plane. - I just don't get what I did. A fucking plane has crashed in the centre of London. Please! --Attack or hijack, claiming probable engine fault. There's someone else. There has to be someone else. --Alleging that the plane was shot down. A quarantine around central London is in effect, and we've been told to expect... Why do these things always happen when you're trying to get somewhere? Oh, look at this. For the love of Chr... (HONKS) Man. Try it now. (BEEPS) - Still nothing. - (SARAH) Oh, you're kidding me. They're supposed to keep people out, not in, for fuck's sake. You couldn't get a better demonstration of how good the lockdown security is. Heh. (SARAH SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) (BOB) I'll try something else. You know, something new. Would you look at that? There's a man's coat in here. Is that Shelley's car? - That's a man's jacket. A man's jacket! - Calm down. - Let me go. - Not until you calm down. I bought this car for us, Mark. I bought this car. Maybe that's why she dumped you. (CHUCKLES) Too soon, yeah? Sorry. - You lousy fucking... - Charlie! Charlie. Leave it out. - Feel better? - Yeah, a little bit. You're on my... You know. - Oh, sorry. Sorry. - Yeah. (GROANS) So, what if she's here. You grin and get your stuff, and then we're out. All right? - Come on, let's get it over with. - Yeah. But if she says one word to me... (KEYPAD BEEPING) - Try it now. - What's going on? My guess would be the plane crash has fucked with all the power and phone lines in the area. It's messing up all the security system. - Keeps sending everything into lockdown. - There's no rush here (!) You know, you guys just keep chatting. I don't need to be anywhere. Let's try this. Ta-da. Thank you. - We're gonna be able to get out of here? - Oh, yeah, yeah, don't worry about that. Cheers for that, mate. I thought she was gonna kill me. No, no, no. Brilliant. You know what I gotta do now, don't you? Is reroute the alarm to the emergency power system. Otherwise you're gonna have this all night. You'll be in a right pickle. So, where's your basement, kid? Which one is it? You don't remember, do you? (CLANGING) (MARK) You won't start something when you see Shelley? - Of course I'm not. - You are, aren't you? Promise me you won't. - Charlie. - I promise. (BOB) Cor. Stinks, doesn't it? (JAKE) Well, you let me know if you need anything, yeah? (BOB MUMBLING) (DOOR CLOSES) Hmm. (BOB HUMS) Eh. Hello. (CLATTERING) Hello? Someone down here? Mm-hm. (HUMS) Hmm. - What...? - Easy, Granddad. I could hear you upstairs. I think you might be looking for that. All right? Granddad? (MUMBLES) Here we go. Ah. Let's have a look here. (CLATTERING) (ROCK MUSIC OVER RADIO) (WOMEN CHATTERING) - Why don't we just move in here? - So, who gets the couch? - Uh, I'm getting it. - How do you know? I chose it. Charlie doesn't have anywhere to put it. He doesn't like it anyway. He has nowhere to put it because you kicked him out. Do you wanna start bringing some stuff down? - No. I'm very happy helping you up here. - 'Cause you're really helping, aren't you? Well, hello. Who's this little guy? I like it, put it in there. - That's the keep box. SHELLEY: Yeah. It's one of the first things Charlie got me. - Chris. - It's cute. It's cute. If someone had bought me this, it wouldn't have taken me five years to dump him. (MUSIC STOPS) - (WHISPERS) Shell. - (MARK) I'll take that. - (WHISPERS) Awkward. - Yeah. Awkward, buddy, yeah. - You might wanna mind your business. - (MARK) Leave it, Charlie. Leave it. - Yeah, don't stop on my account. - Charlie, what are you doing here? - What am I...? - (SHELLEY) You shouldn't be here. I left a message telling you what time I was coming. So you wanted me to see all of this, then, did you? Charlie, what do you want? I wanna know what happened to us. That's what I want. Charlie, now is not the time. I don't care that everyone else is here. I wanna know why we're splitting up. I wanna know why we're standing here with our stuff in boxes... I meant, what do you want from storage? (JAKE CHUCKLES) What? (JAKE) You are having a fucking laugh. (MELANCHOLY ROCK MUSIC OVER RADIO) StaY- Oh, you can't be... (SIGHS) I hate my life. I do. Gotta get a new job. This is just fucking ridiculous. (WHISPERS) Absolutely fucking ridiculous. And I deal with absolute muppets. Honestly. Work in a storage warehouse. What a ridiculous place to work. Looking after people's stuff. I mean, what...? Are you done yet, mate? I can't hear you. What the fuck? (GASPING) (GROWLS) (SCRAPING) (BANGING) (GROWLS) What the fuck was that? Probably just air settling in the pipes or something. - Charlie, you should go. - (MARK) Maybe we should all leave. - If the power's down, we should all go. - It'll be back on. It's been doing this all day since that plane went down. I just wanna get everything sorted. - So you can get me out of your life, right? - (SHELLEY) Yes, Charlie. - So I can get you out of my life. - Just fuck off. - Hey, watch your mouth. - (SHELLEY) Mark. (MARK) Charlie, let's just leave. - I don't know why we should... - Let's leave. Get out. Come on. Leave. - Bye-bye, then. - Shut up, Chris, really. Are you all right, sweetheart? (MATCH STRIKES) (CHARLIE) Chris was lucky I didn't give him a slap. - You know that was lucky, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was lucky. The stairs are this way, are they? Are you sure you don't wanna just go home? Yes. Please, let's just go home. No. You go. I just wanna stay and get this done tonight. All right, then we're not going anywhere. We'll stay and help, yeah? I'm starving. There's a vending machine downstairs by the toilets. Okay, look, I'm gonna go with him because I need the loo. - You wanna come? - No. - Oh, bring me back some water, will you? - Yeah. What the hell happened here? Any sign of the young fellow who works here, no? Hello? (VOICE ECHOES) Hello? (BEEPS) (DIALLING TONE) Line's dead. Is the engineer's van still there? - Yeah. - Yeah, he must be over there. (DIALLING MOBILE PHONE) I've got no service. Have you? Uh, I doubt that because my phone's at the bottom of the river. - Why? - That's what happens when someone dumps you over the phone, Mark. Hello? I don't know, maybe the transmitter was taken out by the crash. Well, I don't intend to spend my night in here, I can tell you that much. The engineer will be back and then we'll all be sorted out and... - What are you doing? - Get out of the way. - Charlie, come on. - Get out of the way. Well, you definitely scratched it. I mean, what were you gonna do if you broke the glass? There's a metal shutter outside. Great. So what do we do now? (CHRIS) He kept making me laugh. (NIKKI) How? Whingeing at her like that. How will that do anything? So bad. Great. Will you get Shell a water for me? - There isn't any. - Make sure no one comes in, please. - No one's coming. Hurry. - Oh, my God. What is that? Wh...? Oh, you want some of me? Pussy hole. Yeah, that's right, Charlie. Mmm. Fuck. Chris? Chris, is that you? Nikki, you almost done in there, babe? Yeah, I'll just be a minute. Chris, did someone come in here? Hello? Hello? (WATER RUNNING) (CREAKING) (WOMAN SCREAMS) What the fuck was that? (CLATTERING) Hello? Hello? Is there someone in here? (GRUNTS) Hello? - We gotta get out of here, man. - What the fuck are you doing in here? No, you don't understand. It's going to fucking kill us. (CLATTERING) He's coming. (CREAKING) (SCREAMING) (KNOCKS) Hi. - What are you still doing here? - Security shutters are down. We're looking for the guy who works here. Thought you might have seen him. No. Where's... Where's Nikki and prick-face? They've gone to get a snack. Oh, there's the lamp from when the time that... (SHELLEY) Mm-hm. Yeah. Hm? What? Hm. Just... Charlie wants you to go and leave us alone so that we can talk about the relationship that we don't have. Again. No, I didn't say that. That's not what I meant. I didn't say that. But, Shelley, if you wanna discuss it, we can... - Look I'll... I'll leave you guys to it, yeah? - No. Mark, stay. Charlie, it's over. Accept it, move on. I can't keep having this conversation. Just tell me what I did wrong. Give me something. (SHELLEY) Nothing. Nothing. I just... I just don't love you any more. I don't know how to make it clearer to you. You don't excite me. You don't make me happy. You don't make me anything. Why won't you accept it? - (CHARLIE) Shelley, let's just... - Charlie, Charlie, leave her. All right? Let her calm down. - Jeez. - Look, I'll go talk to her. Yeah? Yeah, thanks, man. - All right. - Thank you. (GATE RATTLES) You all right? I can't take it any more, Mark. He's getting on my last nerve. - He's upset. - Yeah, well, he's not going on at anyone else all the time. Why do I have to deal with this like I'm the only one who's done anything? - You don't. - Really? - Mark. - Come here, get in. Mark, stop. When are you gonna tell Charlie about us'? - Not yet. It'd kill him now if he found out. - You're gonna have to tell him eventually. I know. Are you sure about us'? - You should go back to him. - In a minute. Not here. (NIKKI) What are you doing here? (CHARLIE) We're locked in. I went down to find the guard or receptionist, but I couldn't find him. (NIKKI) Where is everyone? - Charlie? - What? Where is everybody? I told Shelley how I felt about her so she had to get as far away as humanly possible from me. - And Mark's gone after her. - Right. - And Chris, has he come back yet? - Do I look like I give a fuck? Why do you have to be such a dick, Charlie? Hey, maybe that's why she left you. (SCREECHING) (RATTLING) (SCREECHING CONTINUES) Wait here. (CHARLIE) Mark? Mark? (MARK) Charlie. - You all right? Heard a scream. - Yeah. You? - Yeah. - (CHARLIE) Where's Shelley? She's fine. She's fine. I was, uh... (NIKKI) Mark! (SHELLEY) No, Charlie! (NIKKI) Stop it. Stop. (SHELLEY) Stop it, guys. Just let go. - Charlie... - No, you don't touch me. Don't touch me. I'm sorry, it just happened. It just happened? Well, how long's it been going on? - (MARK) Look, we didn't... - Shut up. Shut up, I'm not talking to you. How long has it been going on? When we were together? Since we split up? I wanna know. Just tell me. - It doesn't matter. - Answer the fucking question. Handy, yeah? So just... Just... Every time you took one of your work trips to Brighton, you were going to see him? Hm? Yes. I'm sorry. - Charlie, where are you going? - Leave him. Classy. Well, at least he knows now. I just wanna go home. Charlie. - Wait up. - Yeah. - Just... - I didn't know. You're her best friend and you knew nothing about it? Mark's your best friend and you didn't know. Well, where are you going? The receptionist has gotta be around here somewhere. - I just wanna go home. - Hey. I'm sorry that they did that to you. (FAINT WHINING) - Charlie. - What? I just heard something. Hello? - There's nothing here. Let's go. - No, wait. I just heard something. - You didn't hear anything. - (FAINT WHINING) I did. There. Did you hear that? Really? (NIKKI) Chris. Chris? Sweetheart, what's up? Chris. What are you doing in here? Chris, what are you doing? He's being stupid. Come on. No, he's not. Are you all right? Babe, look at me. Oh, my God. It's all right. It's all right. I'm here. What happened? Hon? (CHARLIE SNAPPING FINGERS) (CHARLIE) Chris? - (NIKKI) Hey. - Chris. Are you OK? Stop it. Babe. What the. . .? (NIKKI) What happened? Tell me what happened. (CHARLIE) Give me his phone. I need some light. There's nothing up here. (CHARLIE GASPS) (WHEEZING) (SHELLEY) Nikki? Nikki, what's wrong? Where's Charlie? He's in there. What the fuck? (MARK) What happened? (SHELLEY) Chris. The receptionist. His face was ripped to pieces. We are all going to die. You think I don't know who you're working for? Hm? She sent you, didn't she? I know she did. (NIKKI) Guys, help! I know your game, trying to creep up on me. I've got eyes in the back of... - (CHARLIE) What are you doing? - You can't take me! Let go. You send her a message from me. You tell her you can't get blood out of a stone. (GROANS) - Nikki, are you OK? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. I thought he was gonna kill me. - (SHELLEY) Still breathing? - Yeah. But he's gonna have a hell of a headache when he wakes up. - What should we do with him? - Kill him. He killed the other guy, was gonna kill me. - Kill him. - Classy. And what exactly was he gonna do, Nikki? Brush you to death? Let's tie him up. - (DAVID GRUNTING) - (MARK) Hey, hey, hey! Who are you? Let me go. No. It's not as much fun being on the other side of it, is it? Why did you kill that guy? Why? - Who are you? - Fuck you. You might have found me, but I'm not gonna tell you anything. You tell that poison whore to go fuck herself. Which poison whore? Her? (DAVID) My wife. - Your wife? - Who's your wife? - Mary. - (CHARLIE) Don't know her. - That why you killed the receptionist? - Kill? - Yeah, you heard what she said. "Kill." - But I didn't. Well, I was just... See, I was just coming downstairs to brush my teeth - What the hell are you talking about? - (DAVID) Hm? Well, I live here. You live here? My wife, she didn't send you? - Why would your wife send us? - She divorced me. She's trying to bleed me dry, you see, yes. She's not gonna get another fucking penny out of me. No fucking way. I moved all my stuff in here. I live here now. She's never gonna find me. Never. When she attacked me, you see, I thought my wife had sent her. - Have you seen anyone else here tonight? - No, not a soul. - He doesn't look like a killer. - How many have you met? It does explain the slippers and the dressing gown. Nothing explains that dressing gown. Do you have to make a joke out of everything? - You don't tell me anything any more. - Can you shut...? (CLANGING) It's coming for us. It's coming for us. We have to get out of here. We have to... We have to get out of here. (SHELLEY) What is it, Chris? Close the door. Go. I think it's gone. (SCREAMS) It's gonna kill us. It's gonna fucking kill us all. Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! (NIKKI) Chris! (CREATURE SCREECHES) (CREATURE CHITTERING) (CHITTERING CONTINUES) (ROARS) (HEART BEATING) (CREATURE GROWLS) (ROARS) - Won't be seeing him again. - (SHELLEY) What are we gonna do? - I just wanna get out of here. - We can't because the shutters are down. My unit's the best bet. It locks from the inside. In case... In case your wife found you here. We get it. We get it. - This way. Down here. Stairwell and up. - (CHARLIE) Great, further from the exit. My unit's up on level four. We'll be safer up there. Shit. Where's the key? - The key. The key's gone. Shit. - Find it. (RATTLING) (CREATURE CHITTERING) - (DAVID) Shit. - Open the door. - Open the door. - Open the door. - Come on. Open the door. - I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Come on! (MARK) Come on. It's coming. (DAVID) The key is stuck. (NIKKI) It's coming. (CREATURE GROWLS) Oh, fuck. What the hell was that? It came from the plane. I'd put money on it. I've been following it on the news all afternoon. You see? There's no way that was a normal cargo plane. They've locked down half of London. Military everywhere. Snipers, the lot. (REPORTER ON TV) --another large aircraft is heading for UK airspace and has ignored all known landing requests. The MOD now have confirmed fighter jets have been scrambled and are on an intercept mission. In a surprising and alarming move, tanks are on the streets of London. They know there was something on board. Something top secret. Something classified. Something like that fucking thing out there. Are we gonna listen to a guy who lives in a storage unit and is clearly crazy? You think the government hasn't known about this for years? Hello, perhaps you're the one who's deranged. Did you not see the fucker? Hm? Whatever it is, it's out there, on the loose, and it's not exactly trying to make friends with us, is it? Okay, let's imagine for one second that what you're saying is even remotely possible. What do you think it wants? To survive, perhaps? I don't know. Fuck knows, I haven't got a clue. - I can't hear it any more. Think it's gone? - Maybe it's trying to find another way in. - We need to get out of here before it does. - (DAVID) The shutters are locked. Even if we got out of here, we'd still be trapped. Where would you go? Wait. Remember... Remember when we came in, there was a guy outside, an engineer, and he had that device and the shutters were going up and down? We find him, we find the device, we can get out. All the power systems and wiring are in the basement. If the engineer wanted to override the system, he'd go down there. Well, there's no way I'm going back out there. Hm? Shit, he's right. What we need are weapons. - Have you got weapons? - Hm? No. But I do know where to find some. (SHELLEY) Other units. But that still means we have to go out there. Not out. Up. Okay. What you need to do is you need to get to the far end. That's where all the larger units are. That's where all the good stuff is. Charlie. Look, about Shelley, things like this just happen. - She has ambition, you... - Listen, we may have to work together to get out of here alive, but when this is over, I never wanna see you again. (CLANKING) Charlie, I really think that we have enough. Charlie. - (CREATURE SCREECHES) - Shh! (BANGING) It's a dead end. It's a dead end! Up. Up. UP, UP- Help me up. Help me up. Help me. Give me the bag. Give me the bag. (CHARLIE) Shh! Shh! Shh! (WHISPERS) Help me up. Okay. (CHARLIE YELLS) - Charlie, give me your hand. - Mark. (MARK) Charlie. Mark! Charlie, give me your hand! Mark, help me up. Mark. (DAVID) Here they come. (MARK) Here, quickly. Take it. Go on. (DAVID) That's it. (NIKKI) Hey. (SHELLEY) Mark, what about Charlie? - (MARK) He's gone. All right? - What do you mean, he's gone"? He's gone, Shelley! He's gone. He's gone, he's gone. There was nothing I could do. I tried to save him. I tried to save him. It ripped through the air vents like they were paper. We need to get out of here. We need to leave. Here. Take these. We need to go. We need to go. Take it! Here, Shelley, take the knife. Take it. Take it. Come on. All right. We need to get out of here. (DAVID) All right. All right. All right. (BANGING) (IMITATION GUNFIRE) (DOLL) I love you (BEEPING AND WHIRRING) (CREATURE GROWLING) (TOY DOG YAPPING) Charlie, I thought... (CREATURE SCREECHING) - It's coming. - (DAVID) Come on. Oh, dear. (WHISPERS) Go. Don't lose track of the others, Charlie. Go. I'll be fine. I know what I'm doing. (GROWLING) Looks like it's just you and me, then. Look at you. You're vicious, aren't you? Nothing but vicious. You know, you're just like my wife. Yes, you're like my Mary. Yes. Mary. Mary. (CREATURE SCREECHES) Never did have a sense of humour, did you? (CHARLIE) It'll be down here. (NIKKI) There is no way that I'm going down there. You wanna stay up here on your own? Okay. You two go that way. Nikki and I will go this way. - (WHISPERS) Charlie. - Shh. Uh... We found the engineer. Well, most of him. But the device won't be far. You guys go back upstairs. I can't see it, Nikki. Hold this. - (NIKKI) Hm Reauy? W up. Because I was enjoying taking my time down here. Jesus. It's not fucking here. Shit. Charlie. - Is that it? - Yeah. Charlie. (NIKKI) Guys, we've got it. Where's Shelley? - Where's Shelley? - It took her. There was nothing I could do. - (NIKKI) No. - We have to find her. No, it's too late for that. We have to get out or else we'll all die. You can't save her. She's already dead. What, you think she came looking for you? At least we can get outside and call for help. You always talk about me never wanting to be on my own, yeah, and always relying on you. But it's you, isn't it? You need me. It's easy to be the cool one around boring Charlie, right? But you couldn't even get your own girlfriend. You had to go and fuck mine. Yeah, but she loved it. (CHARLIE) Still doesn't mean that I wanna see her get hurt. And you know what? I got nothing to lose now, so I'm gonna go and fight that thing. And if I die, at least I'll know I died more of a man than you. It's suicide, Charlie. Suicide. (CHARLIE OVER RADIO) Shelley. Shelley. (CREATURE ROARS) - Charlie? Charlie, can you hear me? - (CHARLIE) You're alive. - (WHISPERS) Shelley, where are you? - I'm in the lift. - Are you OK? - Yeah. I don't know where it's gone. - I'm coming to get you. - You might wanna hurry. (CLANGING) (CREATURE SCREECHES) - (WHISPERS) What are you doing? - (WHISPERS) What does it look like? I'm saving your ass. Have you got a light? No. (TOY DOG YAPPING) (CHARLIE COUGHING) (COUGHS) - You OK? - Yeah. - Do you think we killed it? - I don't know. - I'm gonna go look for Shelley. - Okay. Hurry UP- (FIRECRACKER WHISTLES) (WHISPERS) Shelley? Shelley? - (SHELLEY) Charlie? - Shelley. - You saved me. - You sound surprised. - Is it dead? - I think so. Okay, let's get the hell out of here. (GROWLING) (BEEPING) Mark? Mark? (SHELLEY) Mark. Mark. Mark. Open the door. (CHARLIE) Open the door. What are you doing? - Mark, open the door. - (CHARLIE) Mark, what are you doing? (SHELLEY) Mark. Mark, open the door. (CHARLIE) Mark, what are you doing? Open... Open the door. (SHELLEY) Mark! Mark! (CHARLIE) Mark! Mark! - Mark! Mark! - (CHARLIE) Mark! Mark! Mark, open the door! Open the door! Mark! Mark! Mark, open the door! Come on, help me with this. Help me move it. (NIKKI) Where did it go? - (CHARLIE) Give me the keypad. - It won't work. It will work. (BEEPING) (CHARLIE) We're getting out of here. (MARK SCREAMS) (MARK GROANING) (YELLS) (GRUNTING) (NIKKI) Fuck you! (YELLS) Charlie. (CREATURE SQUEALS) I just want to go home. Charlie, I'm really sorry for everything. Do you want a lift? No, I think I'll walk. Thank you. Charlie. Did you break the windscreen wiper off my car? Yup. (EXPLOSIONS IN DISTANCE)
