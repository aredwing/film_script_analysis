Come for a drink? No, I'm meeting my wife at 5. We leave this evening. - Where to? - To fetch the kids. Then to my in-laws in the Basque country. Drive safely! - I'll see you in 20 min. - Already? - We said 5 at the bar. - Get my necklace at the jeweler's? The one next to the florist? I'll take care of it. A beer, please. Late afternoon heavy traffic warning: two million cars on the roads for summer vacation. Last year's death toll was 200 at this time. Departure figures are on the rise so far. Highway Safety again urges utmost caution. - Where are you? - It's already 5? Sorry, I had a call! Be right there. Anything else, sir? - Antoine? I'm so sorry... - What're you up to? - I got held up. I'm coming! - Stop saying that. Just come! I'm coming, I'm coming! - How're you? - Fine. You? Exhausted. You didn't look exhausted across the street. I had to answer an email from the US. It took time. Get my message? What're you staring at? - Your necklace. - Why? I hadn't noticed you stopped wearing it. I took it in 3 weeks ago. Want a drink? No, let's get going. You have to get the car and I have to pack. I want to shower first, too. Why leave so early? In an hour, traffic will let up. Let's eat here. You don't mind eating cold, do you? What are you doing? Why are you standing there? I'm going out. - What? - I'm going out. - What for? - Cigarettes. There are plenty here. I'll get gas and check the oil. It'll save time. A scotch, please. - A single? - Double. I filled the tank... And checked the tires. And the cigarettes? - You said we had some. - I was wrong. - Want me to drive? - No, thanks. Sure you're okay? Of course. What's on your mind? Nothing special. And you? I'm dying to see the kids. I wonder if they've changed. You can take a shower. You have time. I have to finish packing. On the A42 south of Beaune a car collided with a truck. The car's occupants were killed instantly. The truck driver is unscathed. 10 minutes later, at the Mcon exit... Let's get off and take the back way. We'll get back on the highway after Tours. What do you think? Hlne? Know Ducasse's fees? Not off the top of my head. It can wait till I'm back. When's that? Tell them the 18th. Hang on! That's a long break! Two weeks. I deserve 'em. Sure you can live without me that long? Aren't you presumptuous! - Take care. - You, too. - What're you doing? - I want to move. But it's only for a few miles! Take the left lane. It's moving faster. Can't you see I'm trying? Watch out! - Why the face? - What face? You seem irritated. Because I'm in the left lane when the right line was fine! - If you're tired, I can drive... - I said no! What're you doing? I have to pee. Need anything? A scotch, please. - Single or double? - Double. There's a detour. We have to go right. Thanks, I noticed. There's always a detour on this road! Can't they repair in winter? - When the ground's frozen? - Or the fall! Not with 2 million on the road! - You missed the turnoff. - What turnoff? For Tours. What about the cars behind us? They aren't all going to Tours. Relax, you'll get to Tours! What'd I tell you? We're on the wrong road. It never occurs to you you could be mistaken. Say what's on your mind for once! - Remember that 125-mile detour? - To avoid traffic! Not intentionally. You trying to piss me off? Just say so! Shut up a second! I'm trying to see where we are. I think we're on Route 182 heading toward Blois. Sure you won't turn around? - Furious? - Me? You see anyone else here? Just because I dared ignore the arrow and we'll make a detour. - What's wrong? - You almost hit the guardrail. Can't I drive? And get there three weeks from now? - The lady doesn't like my driving? - Watch the road. I'll watch the road, I'll drive nicely, carefully, without going off the tracks. You know which tracks I mean? You get my meaning? Is this necessary? That you care what I think? It might help you. - Help me what? - Help you... To understand me, for instance. And in that way... to make my life easier. But I doubt that really interests you. You're far too selfish. If you loved me even a little, you'd... - Finish your sentence! - What's dumber than a train? I felt like a train on that highway. I had to get off the tracks. Understand? Do all these guys ask their wives before getting a beer? You had a beer? - What'd you drink? - A scotch. A double? - And before? - Before what? What did you drink before you got gas? - Nothing. - Is that so? Don't believe me? If it's true, then it went to your head. Think I'm drunk? You talk as if you are. Am I talking nonsense? No, but you hate me. Not at all. I can see it in your eyes. - Why won't you understand? - Understand what? I don't hate you. I just wish you'd treat me like a man sometimes. And let you stop at every bar? - Here we go again! - What? You always find the putdown. - Think I'm an alcoholic? - I wouldn't have married an alcoholic. - Do I drink often? - Not often. - How many times a year? - I've never counted. Two or three times at most. So what's got into you? Dunno. I'm in a tunnel tonight. It's your fault. If only you didn't treat me as the lowest of the low, as soon as I feel like stepping out of line. Is your life that tough? Take Herv... Every evening he's half-drunk. But you still find him interesting. You talk to him for hours, even when he's smashed. First, he's not my husband. And second? - There's a truck. - I saw it! Mind talking about Herv? Will you shut up! I'm trying to read the signs! - Admit you'd rather be with him. - Stop it! Now we're on Route 10. Tours is to the left. A spectacular escape from Le Mans prison... The fugitive, highly dangerous, was last seen in a stolen car. He threatened the police before fleeing. His description has been sent out. What're you doing? As you can see, I'm stopping. If you get out of this car, I'm going on alone. If you intend to join us, you can take the train. And a drink for my young friend here. - This round's on me. - No, my wife's waiting. See George? Life's great. Yep! To the good life! Hey, buddy... That's not very smart. It's very bad for your health, understand? The devil's on vacation with you. Let it all out. I gotta go... You... You're a nice guy. It's written on your fucking face. Everyone can see it. So be careful! I'm going. Buddy, you're going in the wrong direction! "I'm taking the train." You've reached Hl... - Where's this train go? - To the depot. I'm looking for my wife. A brunette with light pants and a tank top. - Any more trains? - Last one just left. - For where? - Bordeaux. - What's the next stop? - Sainte Maure. - Is that far? - 20 miles. You've reached... Move your ass! I've got a train to catch! What're you holding up decent people for? Don't stay here, please. Go back to your car. Can someone tell me what's going on here? Mind cluing me in? They're after a fugitive. What's it to me? There are worse things going on! I gotta meet my wife's train. - The Bordeaux train go by? - 25 minutes ago. Sorry, I have to lock up. What time is it? Ten past midnight. A scotch. This one's on me. Hey, boss, two. Two what? Ask the gentleman what he's having. Two whiskies. I've got lots of time. It's my night. You married? Not married? I'm married. I have two kids, a daughter, 10, a son, 8. They're at camp in the southwest. I'm on my way to pick them up. I'm from Paris. And you? From around here? Not drinking? Don't like it? Never mind, it's a free country. Do what you like. I don't like whisky either. But tonight I happen to be drinking whisky. But it's not my fault really. It's my wife's fault. If you're single, maybe you never wondered, but the question is crucial. Take my wife, for instance. Am I right, am I wrong? Who knows? She must hate me right now, but I don't give a shit. I got sick of playing the good little doggie. Here are my kids. Notice anything? What? That guy. Did you notice a tattoo on his wrist? - What guy? - The one you bought a drink for. And he refused. But that's okay. - It's a free country... - I'm not talking about that. So he got up and left! - Where you headed? - Bordeaux. Gimme a lift? You're on. Oh, shit! Looks like another roadblock. I could use a drink. It's moving. Want a cigarette? Friendly advice: don't breathe in their face. We're through! - Can't you read? - Why? - Speed limit's 55. - I know. - Play it safe and slow down. - Relax! - Know the road? - You bet I know it! Every summer for 15 years. It's my road! I wouldn't mind stopping in. I'm thirsty. Interested? - You're like my dog. - Why's that? Always thirsty. Tongue always hanging out, that it? - Where's your dog? - He's dead. - What're you doing? - What? - Can't you drive straight? - Sure, I can... You're off your rocker! I thought it was a roadblock. You're a real wimp. I got scared, so what? Everybody gets scared. Don't you? What the fuck? I didn't tell you to stop. I need gas. Got any cold beer kicking around? No, but I've got scotch. Pefrect. Want some? Can you talk to me a bit? It'll keep me awake. Talk about what? Anything. I'm a curious guy, I'm interested in everything. Falling asleep? Tired? Never mind, watch the road. I am. Why? Think I'm a bad driver? You're sluggish. - Want me to go faster? - No, straighter. You should trust me more. I drive best when I've had a drink. Sure, one maybe. Why don't you drive if you don't trust me? Leave that alone! Why should I? Don't you ever get smashed? It doesn't interest me. Me neither, usually. An occasional beer after work... Even that... I rarely have time. Gotta be home by 6 sharp. The sitter's waiting for me at the door with her coat on. She's always in a hurry. Dunno why. Her time must be valuable. Everyone's is, except mine. My wife's, especially. She's a corporate lawyer. You can't imagine what it's like. Business lunches every day, always in meetings, never home before 8 p.m. Year in, year out. She's so important that after the kids were born her partners came in person to convince her to come back to work. Imagine! What're you doing? A flat. I didn't do it on purpose. Get out. I'm going. - No spare? - In the trunk. Go get it! Get the jack! - You got a jack? - I must have one. Where is it? Know how it works? Sure I do. Sorry. Wait... I'll do it. Get up. Would you get up! Stop hitting me. I'll get up. To think, hundreds of 'em are out looking for you, howling your name on every TV program... You screwed 'em good. You don't give a shit about their laws. That's the truth! If men weren't scared shitless, if they were real men like you, we wouldn't need courts and cops and red lights at every intersection. You're above all that. You're a lord, a prince. Tonight, I feel happy. Happier than I've ever been in my life. You can't imagine how happy I am. You're a brother. You could've left me back there to die like a dog. If you didn't do it for fear I'd turn you in, you're wrong. I'm no snitch. I have a sense of honor. I'm a man, too. You misjudge me. That hurts me. It really hurts me that you misjudge me. Hlne misjudges me, too. She doesn't think I'm a man, either. What're you doing? Think I didn't see that? Hey, you hear me? This isn't the road to Bordeaux! - Shut up! - It's my car, my road, turn around! Shut up, or out you go. It's my car. You don't scare me. You got no gun. - Shut up! - You got no gun. I saw you with the tire. Why drive with one hand? - You're a cripple, that it? - Will you shut up! Get out. What're you gonna do? If you're gonna kill me, do it fast and clean. I don't wanna suffer. - Break down? - A flat. - Give me a lift to the next garage? - Sure. No, the other side. Is that the village? Are we far from Bordeaux? This isn't the road. - Really? - Bordeaux's quite a ways. Why? You want to go to Bordeaux? What's the make of your car? A gray Rover with Paris plates. Got the keys? They in the ignition? I'll send someone. That's my car. You must've driven a long time with the flat. It's torn to shreds. You need a new one. Did you find a cell phone in the car? Sure that clock's right? Is it really 11 a.m.? Yes, why? What time do you think it is? You think it's still last night? Not going down? Badly. Won't you eat something? I'd rather not. What happened to you? Why? What's wrong? Looks like you got into a fight. Can I use your phone? Local calls only. You've reached Hlne's... It's Antoine Dunan. Your children are ready, they're waiting for you. We expected you at 10. What happened? - My wife's not there? - Isn't she with you? - She hasn't called? - Where are you? She was supposed to arrive by the morning train. - What time? - The first train, I think. - The 6 a.m. bus? - I'll call you right back. - France Telecom... - The Cascade Hotel. - Which town? - Andernos. - Shall I connect you? - Please. Cascade Hotel. This is Mr. Dunan. Did my wife take the room we reserved? No, sir. No one showed. Can you check the room? The key hasn't moved. How will you pay? We held the room. Do you know what time the first train arrives from Bordeaux? 6 a.m. It's a bus. - And the next one? - Just before 10. France Rail. Is this the Andernos station? Do you know if the 6 o'clock bus arrived? And the 10 o'clock bus? On time? You sure? My wife should've been on one. A brunette, short hair... We don't check our passengers. Of course. I'm sorry. Andernos Police Dept. Excuse me, I'm worried about my wife. She was to arrive this morning. Do you... - Name? - Hlne Dunan. - Age? - 40. - Description? - Average height, short brown hair. - Wearing light pants and... - No one answers that description. You sure? - No one was taken to the hospital? - A man who had a car accident. Did you hear if the bus had any problems this morning? Not to our knowledge. Try the train station. Thank you. Antoine Dunan again. - Has my wife arrived? - Not in the past 5 minutes. She hasn't called? - You sure? - Absolutely. - Could anyone else have answered? - Only I answer the phone. - So what do we do? - What do you mean? What do I tell the children? Tell them... Tell them we've been delayed. When do you expect to arrive? In two hours at most. And if your wife arrives? Tell her she can reach me... Is this the number? - At 0546541322. - All right. Want anything else? Sure you're all right? It's my wife. What's happened to her? I can't seem to find out. She's vanished. We left Paris last night. We had a spat, she decided to take the train. After that I don't know. Where were you? In Tours. You saw her board a train? France Telecom... The Tours police, please. I'm looking for my wife. We split up just before Tours and I have no news. I wondered if you heard anything. Hold the line. No, sir, nothing unusual reported. Where was the train going? - Bordeaux. - Maybe she left you a message. Bordeaux station. Is there a message for Mr. Dunan? A message when? - Last night or this morning. - Hold the line. No, sir, no message. Sorry. Did the night train from Tours arrive this morning? Yes, sir. - No problems? No delay? - Hold the line. I'm told it was 30 minutes late due to an incident in Poitiers. What was it? I'm afraid I don't know, sir. Poitiers station. I understand there was a problem on the train last night. That's correct. Can you tell me what? A woman was found unconscious with a head wound. The Emergency Squad took her to the hospital. Do you know the woman's name? We weren't told her identity. You didn't see her? I wasn't on duty last night. Poitiers Hospital... I'd like to speak to Mrs. Hlne Dunan. She's not on my list. Is she in maternity? No, she was brought in to the emergency room last night. - About what time? - After midnight. Just a moment, please. There's a mistake. The hospital's full. No one's been admitted. She may have been treated here and taken elsewhere. Try Jean Bernard Hospital. Hold the line. Is she in surgery? I don't know. She was found on a train. Hold the line. Just a minute! She's probably not registered under her name. What name would it be? None. I just found out she has a head wound. - How old is she? - 40. Hold the line. We don't have that person. Last night several ambulances... Poitiers Hospital... Sorry to bother you again. My wife's probably not registered under her name. - What name then? - None. A woman of 40 was found on a train with a head wound. I'm terribly sorry. We have no one of that description. Did you try Jean Bernard? Try the police in Poitiers. They should know which hospital. - Try the University Hospital. - She's not there. - And Jean Bernard? - Not there either. Try Chtellerault. Chtellerault Hospital. Did you admit a woman with a head wound? - You are? - Her husband. Your name, please. - Is she there? - If she's the one found on a train. - Can I speak to her? - Your name, please. - Antoine Dunan. - Hold the line. I'll pass you the head nurse. I'm told you're the husband of our injured patient. I can't wake her up right now. The doctor ordered not to disturb her. - How is she? - She's in shock. - What happened? - The doctor will explain. Can't you tell me anything? - Is she okay? - She's out of danger. - We're expecting you. - I'm leaving now. Can I make one more call? Sure. It's Antoine Dunan. I found my wife. She's in a hospital in Chtellerault. What happened? She was hurt on a train. That's all I know. I'm going right now. Could you keep the children until this evening? Yes, but till what time? Eight at the latest. Don't you want to speak to the kids? I'm in no shape to. I'll worry them even more. I'm sorry... Explain the situation. Reassure them. I'll do my best. Won't you eat something? Can I pay for the calls and the rest by credit card? If you like. My wife's in a hospital in Chtellerault. I heard. But are you sure it's her? I'm Antoine Dunan. I called about my wife. You can't go up now. Visiting hours start at 2:30 p.m. - The head nurse said... - One moment. I'm the one you spoke to earlier. Your wife's still sleeping. With what the doctor gave her, she'll be out a while. - I must see her. - Let me ask the doctor. He's busy now. - I have to see her. - I understand, but you can't just yet. Can you tell me what happened? The doctor will see you. Take a seat. Someone will come for you. Lt. Levet, Poitiers police. Have you managed to see your wife? Not yet. I'm to wait for the doctor. Very well. Please follow me. Wait. You can go in. I haven't had time to fill you in on the facts. Your wife, if it's her in there, is out of danger. The doctor is definite about that. But she's in a state of shock. Whatever she does or says, you must remain calm. Your husband's here. Forgive me. I was so afraid. I called the children. They're fine. They're waiting for us. Did they tell you? What? What is it? Tell me what? What's the matter? Hlne, look at me. You'd better leave now. The doctor doesn't know if your wife can leave tonight, and he wants her to rest this afternoon. He'll examine her again at 7 p.m. Do you hear me? Do you know what my wife was trying to tell me? Let's find a place where we can talk quietly. Can you give me your wife's maiden name? Meurissey. Place of birth? Dakar, Senegal. Your address? Is your wife employed? Yes. In a law firm. Do you work as well? I work for an insurance company. Do you have children? Two. A daughter, 10, and a son, 8. They're at summer camp. We're on our way to pick them up. Have you and your wife known each other long? We married 12 years ago, - What terms are you on? - Good terms. You weren't with her last night? Only in the early evening. Why only then? I stopped for a drink. Where? First just south of Chartres. On the old road. I can't say where exactly. Did your wife go in? - She stayed put. - What'd you drink? - Scotch. - Then what? - We got back on the road. - Did you argue? Not really. Hlne was testy. That makes me belligerent, but it was no big deal. A normal spat. But you stopped another time? - Where? - Just before Tours. Your wife didn't join you? When I came out of the bar... Yes? She was gone. She left a note saying she was taking the train. Did she threaten to do that? She said she'd leave in the car. Why didn't she? I'd taken the keys with me. She didn't say she'd leave anyway? You sure? No mention of a train? Mr. Dunan, does your wife have a habit of disappearing? Did you have a violent row before? Just a few words. Did she mention divorce? I had one drink too many. It's not grounds for divorce! When you realized your wife was gone, what did you do? I went to Tours station. How long do you think you were in the bar? Ten minutes, maybe 20. I tried to leave, but a guy bought me a drink. You return the favor? No, but he wouldn't let me go. Think she could've got to Tours on foot? Maybe someone drove her or she called a taxi. She did call a taxi. And the taxi driver, who parked at Tours station, said a gray Rover with Paris plates roared off. Was it you? - I tried to catch the train. - Did you? It left Sainte Maure 20 minutes before I arrived. I gave up. What did you do? Mr. Dunan, what did you do? I went into the bar across the street. Did you notice anyone in particular there? You didn't strike up a conversation as in the previous bar? No, I just had a drink. Very well. I'll go get us something to drink. Coffee or something else? - I wouldn't mind. - What? Coffee. Christophe Mantana... He broke out of Le Mans prison. He was found dead by the D35. A car seems to have run over him several times. Witnesses sighted Mantana in the bar after the train left Sainte Maure station. After Sainte Maure, we lose track of him. He must've met some trusting soul who gave him a lift. But this time Mantana met a man who didn't want to wind up as road kill. Other witnesses say Mantana was at Tours station before the train left. He followed your wife aboard. The train was virtually empty. He could attack her without being seen. He got off after taking her jewelry and purse contents. We'll know in a few days, when the DNA tests come back. Why DNA tests? It wasn't just to rob her that he attacked your wife. The doctor will examine your wife again at 7 and tell you if you can see her. That gives you time to go into Chtellerault and find a hotel for the night. Are you in shape to drive? - What time is it? - 6:30 p.m. You sure? Clara, this is Daddy. - Is Mommy okay? - Mommy's fine. She gets out of the hospital tomorrow. For sure? Yes, I promise. Don't worry. Will you really be here tomorrow? C'mon, honey, don't cry. Everything's fine. If you cry, I'll cry, too. Yes, Daddy. We're thinking of you very hard. We send our love, we love you. - Mommy, too? - Mommy, too. See you tomorrow. Is that Mr. Dunan? Are you Mrs. Dunan's husband? Barring complications, she can leave tomorrow morning. Her head wound isn't a pretty sight, but it'll heal fast. The hardest part in her case will be psychological. It'll take time for her to feel normal again. She said you have kids? Yes, two. - How old? - 8 and 10. - Boy? Girl? - One of each. Her pregnancies weren't difficult? No complications, no miscarriages? She's awake. Let's go see her. Take a seat. Can you come out a minute? It's past visiting hours. Make sure he stays no more than 20 min. The nurse will come for you. Don't stay more than 20 min. and don't let her talk too much. All right? Your wife's waiting to see you. Don't say anything. The nurse wanted to make me up. I said no. I don't look too awful? Not at all. You looked so scared earlier. I was afraid you'd hate me. Why? It's all my fault. I have to tell you something. Do you know when I started to lie last night? We hadn't even left. I told you I'd had a beer, but no. I'd had three. When you were in the shower, I said I'd get gas. It wasn't true, either. I had a scotch. I kept going all night. I wanted to feel strong. Completely free. You hated me. I took it all out on you, on us, on the children even. With a drunkard's rage, I tried to debase everything and I kept going all night. Until I wound up this morning on the roadside without knowing where I was. Did you have an accident? You're shaking. In just a few hours, our life turned upside down. Be quiet. And I'm afraid. Afraid nothing will ever be the same... That each time the memory of... When we're happy, we don't pay attention. The four of us were happy, right? Please stop. I want us to leave here tomorrow and go get the kids together. Antoine, I want to live with you.
