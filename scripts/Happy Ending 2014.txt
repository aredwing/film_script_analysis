Thank God they took your car, not your housel I'll return their goddamn moneyl What's wrong? No money in the bank? Fine, let's break some funds. No funds either? Nothing?

It was nice meeting you all. I-Ii! Who is she? - Your dooml Rack Publishing signed her after cancelling your contract. - What? They've given her a 3-book deal. - What? And they're also paying her double. - What? Why are you on repeat-mode? But how? Why? She's smart. Writes well. Maybe... even better than you. And she doesn't have your attitude. Plus, she writes romantic novels, which always sells. She got the contract because of you. You made her. I hope you're happy... with your fame, money and boozel Girlsl - What? Fame, money and girlsl Not booze, I am not Devdasl What now? Read this. You might learn something. Crazy Heartsl Crazy Fartsl What? Reay? - Yeahl When? How? - What do you mean, how? Are you sure? - Are you serious I was travelling all of February. Then how... is it possible? Didn't you come down one Thursday for that meeting? But we don't do it on weekdays. - We did it that day. Correct... shit I mean... so sweetl Baby, come here. Baby? Baby, what happened? Baby, what happened? Baby, I am actually really happyl It's wonderful news. Superb news.

We need to do something. Not us, you...l Thanks. Hey Yogi, sit with me. Talk to me. About what? About life. I'm busy. Don't do it. What? - Don't call Divya. Why? Look... men go crazy between 12 and 4 am. They over-commit, get sentimental. Cry and weep. And settle for anyone. Basically, they start thinking from their pants. Then comes morning, and they come to their senses. Next comes remorse. That they are in more trouble now than when they startedl But it's Divyal - She's your ex, and married. She has three kids. Actually, they are triplets. So, counts as one. See, Yudi. You will do what you want to do. My advice... ...is don't do. Hello. - Hi. Yudi? - Are you sleeping? It's 2 am. - Can you open the door, please? What? You're kidding me. What are you doing here in the middle of the night? I'm in a mess. I'm broke. Ohl You need money? No...l just wanted to talk to someone. Where's that girlfriend of yours? It's a bit complicated. I mean, I've broken up with her. But I don't think she's understood. Did you tell her clearly or is it all just in your head? I've given her few hints. Some things never change. If I lell her directly, it will break her heart. What a thoughtful jerk. You know what your problem is? You love the fun that comes with romance ...but not the responsibility that comes with commitment. What's so wrong with that? I mean all relationships are fun and exciting in the beginning. Later, the mystery's dead once you know each other. And all the excitement and romance disappear. We covet commitment so much that we ruin what we have. And what remains? Fights, battles, family, her mother's birthday ...his uncle's anniversary, baby showers.. Then you have three kids. And that's the end of lifel Shut up, Yudi. - Papa, I need to go potty. Mummy.. - It's called lifel Whatever, dude. Couldn't you wait for me a little longer? Why are we discussing this now? I did wail, you know. A really long time. Hey, remember.. ...our Vegas trip? - Yeahl Mad trip, right? - Let's just wipe that off memory. And our matching tattoos. You know, mine's faded a bit. - No, no, it's okay. Don't take off your pants. It's okay. And yours? ls it fading too? Nol Mine's great. You still have it, right? Yeahl You didn't get it removed, did you? You got it removedl Why? What do you mean, why? If Jason saw it, what would he think? Yudil - You could have made up somethingl He can't read Hindi anyway. Let me see what you did. No. - Show me. - Yudi, just stop it. - Show me. What is wrong with you? What the hell is going on? Hi, honeyl Who wears pink shorts, dude? If you break my marriage, I will kill you. - Okay, okayl Here we gol Thanks. But you really didn't have to do this. I could've taken a taxi. - Why taxi? I am your personal, sexy, chauffeur. Okay. I'll be awhile. You go ahead. It's okay, I've cancelled all my appointments. Shall I wait for you at the coffeeshop? No, no, please don't wail for me. Gary will drop me home. Baby. I can wait for you all my life. Isn't that a bit too long? Yudi, forever and everl So sweetl Love you. I know you love me too. Hi, Yudi. How are you? How is life treating you? Cut the bullshit, Gary. Why did you call me here? Look, maybe this isn't the best But this is all you have now. And I think you should do it. You got me some shady deal again? Do you want the car back or not? I liked your book. What was the name again? - Operation Payback. Yes. Operation Playback. Payback. - Yeah, right. The story's good, tight. The second half is a bit slow. You read my book? - He did.

Comedy. I want a romedyl Two birds with one stone. What? Classes and masses. Get them both. - Great ideal Writers are such copycats nowadays. They make a dozen films with the same successful idea. Someone's remaking this hit South Indian film. Now everyone's working on the same idea. That's the business. - But, Sir, Why don't you sit here instead of me? - Sir, No, no, I'll go get a message. You sit here. - Sorry, Sir. Go on. Last night I saw this Hollywood film. And it just clicked. I knew then this is my gold standard. I took the next flight here. Now, I'm looking for a mixed writer ...who can write a Bollywood film, Hollywood-style. Mixed writer? Great idea. Money is not a problem. I want to make a film that has Comedy, flirting and steaminess Kickassl Kickass? - Kickassl Kickassl Oh Kickassl First half, Meet Parents. Second half, Meet Fuckers. Mix and match. We have a silver jubilee. Look, Armaan, Ji.. Armaan-ji. These are famous films. We can't just copy, I mean We'd get caught. So what good is he for? Get creative, man. So what if we're caught? It's your neck on the line. But I'll get you out. - We will. Can I tell you something, Armaan? You spent a fortune coming here, and you're with the best writer. Let's get him to write something fresh. Where are you from originally? I am from San Francisco. No wonder. Listen, do whatever, but I want a young love story. - Consider it done.

But why? Because you.. And then Lovel Lovel Lovel Lovel But, all boys are doggie. And all girls are not doggie. Something goes wrong. Then comes "l've changed. I'm completely sorry. I love you". In the end, everything's happyl But yes, the boy and girl should be handsome. Costumes by Manish (Malhotra), Abu Jani... Music by Pritam. And if you go abroad to shoot them, great. That's how you write a romantic comedyl "And this is the secret only true lovers share." "The joy they find in each other, and the dreams they dare to dream.." "..is by virtue of the power of love that engulfs them." "Consumes them. And transcends all bounds." "So her thoughts were exactly this." "Love me..and free my soul." "l love you..and I adore you." "And I do this because I do not know.." "..any other way of loving." "And I am just thankful." $1 What lheul Thank you. Beautiful writing. Beautifull That last chapter tears just welled up. I was really choking. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm the one who wrote it. But every time I read it, it still makes me emotional. It's my favorite chapter. Mine too. You've read my book? - No. But I will now. For sure. - I hope you like it. Incidentally, what kind of books do you like? I like all kinds of books. Put a telephone directory in front of me, I'll even read thatl Have you read this book? I hear it's really good. That's a really old book. It's still on the shelves? Well, it's a classic. Classic? Why, there's no depth in it. He wrote something. And he just got lucky. You just said you like all kinds of books. What's so wrong with this one? It's just a one-book wonder. He wrote something for the heck of it and it became a hit. By fluke. My agent said he's totally ruined. Poor guy's on the streets now. Should I sign you a copy? Your name? - Yu.. Yogi. Yogi. See you. Hang on a second. Half of them fell asleep listening. Actually, I almost fell asleep readingl You know, I don't get it. Why do people show up at readings? Clearly, they have nothing better to do. If they love books, why can't they just buy the book and read it at home? Omigodl I forgot to tell you. After the reading, an Indian came up to me.. And said, "Beautiful writing my eyes welled up.. "..L was choking.. Really choking." What a pansyl I know right? I'm actually writing all this romantic bull.. Which people are buying.. And getting sentimental, can you believe it? I knowl If anyone hears me like this That's it. I'll be banned. Hello. - She's a fraudl That girl is a fraud. And she had the gall to criticize my bookl Yudi, I am pregnant. She's selling rubbish and she knows it. Her readers are all a big joke for herl Man, I am the joke here. I'm going to read her book.. Throw it on her face and say "This is nonsense."

Why are you following me? I am writing a romantic comedy. And I thought I'd read your book. And guess what I found out You are a fraudl - What? What do you mean? "If anyone hears me like thisu" "..l'll be banned." - Stop it. "L such am a big writer now. All of America has read my book." "My agent says I am No. 1." "What I didn't know is that agent ...gives this spiel to all his clients. By the way, you write well. But I have to tell you one thing. Your book readings are so boring.. That people were falling asleep. I'm sure some even died. - It's okay. My books sell. Yes, but the question is entertainment. How do we make your readings more entertaining? You don't need to do anything. I'll manage. How about some advice from a senior, super successful writer to a budding writer? - No, thank you. Shhl Just listen. People aren't there for your reading skills, you know? They're there to meet the writer - see if his personality is exciting.. ...all his experiences in life. What, should I read out my biodata? - No, but be charming. Chat with your audience, crack some jokes. They'll read your book at home. So for one hour, spend 15 minutes reading.

Who'd have thought, aahl I love the 80's. Okay. Okay. Let me start over. We met 11 months ago, and I kissed you at Nancy's home. Not cheek-to-cheek, but lip-to-lip.

If you wanted to prance in the shower, ...you could've at least locked the door from inside. Montu, you're stuck on the wrong detail. I mean, when I shower, I always lock the door from inside. And from the outside, when Gauri's in the shower. Montul Focus. Get me out of this mess. Walk with me. You deleted the video on her phone. She has a copy of it on her laptop. And the laptop's at her home. Right. So, here's the plan. We'll sneak into her house and delete that file from her laptop. She's leavingl She's leavingl Where did you call her? - Arclight Theatre.

About sneaking into your house. Oh my God. - Your computer? He smashed it. Oh my Godl So it was you the other day? You didn't know? So what were you mad about? No wonder I smell you all over the housel And I thought I was missing you. I'm so stupidl You know what, I deserve better than this. I am sorry, Vishakha, l.. Actually, you know what? You're absolutely right. You do deserve better. You should spend your life with a better man. I'm not good enough for you. Are you trying to get rid of me? - What? Nol Nol at all. - For that girl? What? Which girl? - I know all about you and that 'writer'. Ohl - Oh? Is that all you have to say for yourself? You're cheating on me, Yudi. You broke my heart. No, Vishakha, there's nothing between us. - Don't lie to mel You're having an affair with that pseudo, intellectual.. Matching-matching, rice-plate Reddy, aren't you? No.. We're just friends. Nothing's happened - no kiss-wiss, sex-wax And anyway we're not together anymore. You and I are not together-together anymore, right? Are we? Gimme fivel - It's not confirmed yet. It is confirmed. That's all the confirmation you need. Beyond this is your judgment. Come on, gimme fivel I feel bad for her. - Gimme fivel On this sidel Gimme ten you're free again - You two are celebrating You both should be ashamed. Movel Out of my wayl Be ashamed. Now your chapter is over. My Bab)!- So I thought, maybe I could become a writer too. Wowl I don't have a cool back story like you. It's jusL. As a kid, I used to watch Dad He never had time for anyone. Not even himself. He was successful, but, You know, ...l wanted to taste life, you know what I mean? I tried starting my own rock band. But that was hard work too. That's when I realized I should be a writer. How's your life of leisure working out for you these days? I'm brokel I have to work now. No choice. Trouble is, I can't write. - You've forgotten how to work? It's writer's blockl - More like a mental block, don't you think? Can I ask you something? How do you write these love stories? You don't even believe in them. - How do you know? Maybe deep inside, I'm romantic?l So Yudi's life is just like a romantic comedy now. Soo sweetl Correct. In this big wide world, we bumped into each otherl You didn't bump into her, you stalked herl We're a nice combination. She's hot. I'm cool. She's romantic on the inside, I'm romantic on the outside. She's young, l'"1 Y'-"\9- Shut up, I'm not old. Okay, young at heart! Anyway, everything's perfect. - Actually This is going too smooth. Something's going to give somewhere. - Shut upl What? - She could be engaged. Married. Pregnant. And if it's a serious film, she could be terminally ill. - Whal?l That doesn't always happen. It does. Almost all the time. It's a requirement. Hey, what's up? - Nothingl Just thought I'd say hi. - Okay? Hi, Yudi. Are you married? What? No. I knew it. Did you call me to ask that? - No. I just called. And, you aren't engaged, are you? Have you seen a ring on my finger? - No. You could've hidden it also, like Montu. - Who's Montu? What are you blabbering about? You don't have a boyfriend, do you? - No, Yudi. I don't have any boyfriend. I knew ill Any critical Uh, you're healthy overall, right? - What thel Good, good. Done. Any more questions? What? Okay call you later byel Well? - You didn't ask all the questions. Will you accept her if she's carrying someone else's sin ...in her stomach? Shut upl - Just asking. So, situation normal. - Impossible. Every story has something happening right about at this point. When? - Now. Now? - Almost. Now? What happened to you? This.. was.. a small accident. Wasn't an accident. It's an allergy. All this stuff around my face? These foreigners overdo things. Give me a few days. I'll be fine. What do you got? Write something? No, l'll.. finish it soon. I have a new idea. What's this? - It's all his genius. Thing about me is, ...l'm a method actor. I've done my homework. I've marked the best scenes in these films. Use the ones you think are right for the script. This way, no one will ever be able to tell.. ...which film we copied it from. You mean you watched all these films and marked every scene you liked? - He saw them. I understood them. So. Knock yourself out inserting these scenes. Armaanji, I think we should try something different. What is different? No matter how different you try to be.. People watch what they like. Okay, just give me one week. I promise you, your mind will be blown. He doesn't get it. He doesn't get it. Look here. This look? There's 10 pages of dialogue coming. Can you hear them? Hold ill Wide shotl Jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, closel Wide againl Cut to song. That's how you write scripts. Sir? - Not yet. There was a time when.. ...whatever I said was the script. If I didn't? Pause. If I was having an affair with the heroine? Pregnant pausel Screw it. Do your thing. I don't like interfering anyway. I'm just sharing these ideas so.. ...you don't write a boring script. - No, no. It is a romcom. Remedy. But it should be a bit hard hitting. Intense. Life is hard hitting and intense too. Do all of that on your own time. Sir, I just don't want the script to be cheesy. Cheesy? Understand this truth. In this world, every boy is na'l've.. ...every girl is insecure, and we're all cheesy in real life. People go to the theatres ...with their family and a tub of popcorn. Don't waste their money. Everything should be spectacular. And happy. Let the hero and heroine run into each others arms. Let there be slow-motions. Let there be sunset. If it rains, let it. If it songs play, let them. Why, if they want to kiss, let theml These days, the Censors aren't an issue. People should be happy. Don't get stuck in your creativity. Don't give life lessons for 300 rupees. There's no more, Sir. Let's write quietly for one hour. You write yours, I'll write mine. I don't have anything like this. Can I borrow your dolly? Absolutely not. That's my lucky charm. Don't touch it. Fine. Can you type a little slower? You're giving me a complex. Focus. I can't do this. Tryl It hasn't even been 5 minutes. I need inspiration. Isn't this enough? I have an idea. What is it? You're off to 'Frisco tomorrow, right? - Yeah? Let's drive there. - Why? Because you haven't seen the Pacific Coast Highway. And maybe I'll find my inspiration driving. But my flight and hotel have been booked. - So? Get them cancelled. Think about it. The coast on one side. Open skies on the other. And me, in the middle of it alll No. I have a reading day after morning. I'm not taking any risk. Baby, I am risk-free. I come with a guarantee. Are you sure this is a good idea? - Absolutely. We'll head out in the morning, reach by sundown, and you can make it for your reading the next morning. Come on. Fine. - Done. But we'll start early. - Absolutely. Early morning. Finallyl You call this early morning? It's not morning yet. You've calling me like a psycho from 6 aml You said we'd leave early morning. Early is 11 or 12, after a nice long breakfast. What's with all this luggage? Planning to settle down there? What? This is just basic stuff. You should've brought some porters along. Don't be such a big baby. Reay? Your Highnessl - Thank you. Thank you. Wowl This is so beautiful! If this doesn't inspire you.. ...you should just quit writing. You're welcome. And you wanted to fly alone. All we need is some background music to go with this scene. Sure. Oh man. What? No, this is not nice. No way "It's not the flu or feveru" "He-s justu" "Down with love." "Down with love." "The black eyes." "The fair cheeks." "The sultry gaze." "The enticing gait." "Why did you break my heart." "Why did we fall in love." "Why did you go away.." "Away...Away.." "Comeu" "Shower me with your love.." Give it to mel - Stop it Yudi. "What's behind the veil." "Behind the veil.." "What's behind the veil." "Behind the veil.." "My heart's behind my veil.." "Every time I see a girl, my crazy heart goesu" "Ole...Ole...Ole.." "l sway, dance and sing the song of love." "Ole...Ole...Ole.." Aahl Nonsensel Nonsensel You Idiot. Are you okay? - What happened? I feel asleep. - You fell asleep at the wheel? Hold you, please don't sleep. - So it's my fault? Of course. First, you wake me up at 6 like some school teacher. And then happily dazed off. Nonsensel It's not starting. Engine must be flooded. What now? I'll call AAA. They'll gel us out of here quickly. Oh God, we'll be very late. - No, we won't. I'll get you there by tonight, I promise. Y! Y! No, I'm not asking why. Iam saying Y. My name is Yudi. Y for Yahoo. U for Underwear. U for Unicorn. What did they say? It'll lake at least 4 hours. 4 hours? I can't believe I made such a huge mistake. This was such a bad idea. As long as you had the wind on your face, everything was fine. At the first sign of trouble, it became a bad idea? I cancelled my nice, comfortable flightl If the pilot had fallen asleep ...you wouldn't even get a chance to argue like thisl Yudi, you do realize we could've diedl - Don't be so dramatic. Whoa, I'm being dramatic nowl - Of coursel We should get a lift. I can't believe thisl No one wants to helpl Wait. What are you doing? What are you doing? Take off your shirt.

You need a sexy pose. Sexierl That's good, That's nice. Nice. And turn around slowly. Slowly, slowlyl Shut up, Yudi. Okay, it's networking. Tell you what, take the top off. What the hell are you doing there? Get up. I think you'll do better than me. Take it off. Why are you covering? - Are you mad? Take it off, Yudi. Show your chest. Stick it out a little bit. - Yeahl Nice. Heyl You need a ride? No, no. Please go. It's okay. Thank you. Idioll He called you an idiotl Finallyl You from India? Yeah. Girlfriend? - Nol We're just friends. Just friendl Tell him, Yudi. I have 'just friend'. - Yeah? Shut up, Yudi. How much longer? 2 minutesl 15 minutes. 20-25 minutesl Thanks. So sweet - The perfect Facebook moment. Yay, I'm finally marriedl Hubby and wifey foreverl I love youl Heart, heart, heart. At least 15 Comments and 100 Likes. "What a lovely couple you guys make." "You guys are perfect for each other." What do you think? 3 years? - Nah. 1 year tops. First 3 months will be ruled by hormones. Next 3 by realization... and the following 3 by frustration. By the first anniversary, they'll be at war. "Give me my spacel" "l don't like your motherl" "What's wrong with my mother?" "l hate you. I don't want to talk to you." "Eff youl" "Eff youl" Hey, that groom looks.. Just like the hero from one of your books. If I ever run into the hero of my book.. ...l'll knock him out. I don't get it. Every girl talks about equality and independence. And yet all of them wanL. ...their prince charming to swoop in and rescue them. Complete them. Change their life. Doesn't make sense, right? Then why do you write those books? What difference does it make if I write or not? Dude, you're a bit offl What? You and me, we won't last 6 months. - 6 months? We can't last 6 hours. An whole lifetime is out of the question. Perfect. Cheers to that. What? Why didn't you book a room for yourself? I didn't Where did you plan on sleeping? - I don't know. I don't think that far ahead. - Yudil I thought you were on top of the arrangements. I handled the travel. Are you really sure you don't have any extra rooms? Sorry, ma'am. We're fully booked. This has to happen. Enjoy your stay- I can't believe I'm forced to share a room with you. Come on, we're adults. We'll manage. I'm an adult, I can't say the same about you. So listen. I'll lake the bed and you take the couch. You know, I have a bad back. I can't sleep on the couch. So I should sleep on the couch? - No. You don't have to. It's a big bed. We both can fit in here comfortably. Without even touching each other. I promise. No. This is ridiculous. I always sleep on the left side. You're on the left, just in the other direction. Hang on a second. This is my room. Why should I sleep on this side? - Don't be selfish. Switch! Reay? - Yeahl Roll over the blanket, Yudi. Can you keep your feet away from my face? You too. Your feet stink. - Not more than your face. Can you.. Aanchal. Aanchal. Aanchal. Aanchal. Okay, I'm going to lift your arm in the air. If you're asleep, your arm will slay up. Else it will fall down. How old are you, Yudi? Oh, so you're awake. What do you want? - Nothing. I just wanted to apologize. You met with an accident because of me. So I'm sorry. I shouldn't have fallen asleep either. Sorry, I got carried away and said too much. - No. It was my idea to drive here. All I had to do was drop you here safe and sound. Driving here wasn't a bad idea at all. I really enjoyed it. Lovely weather, right? The room's nice too. So is the bed. So soft. Should we do something? Make out? What? I can't hear you? I think we should make out. - I can't hear you, Yudi. Let's kissl You didn't have to kick me. A polite no would've done fine. Uhh, okay. Hmm? Okay. What okay? You won't fall in love, right? I don't fall in love. Good. - And normally, I usually say this to girls. And I can never be so direct. All I am saying is ...l go back next week I don't want things between us So let's not complicate things. - Nol Let's just be in the moment. - Yeahl You understand, right? No falling in love. Just control yourself. I'm very addictive. What? - Should we put on some music? I'm sorry. - You have a big nose. You moved your heacL. Okay. Anyway, let's try this again. Should we increase the volume? Are you going to talk nonstop? Nol Nothing's changed, right? Not at all. In fact, you seem more irritating. Can we sleep properly now? What, you mean upside down? My face hurts. I don't know how many times you kicked me in your sleep. Next time sleep on the couch. Tell me. One second, almost ready. How do I look? Like you worked really hard all night. - Shut upl Relax. It will be fine. "To gain something, you have to lose something." "Rena knew it boiled down to just three words." "But did she have the courage to finally say them aloud.." "..to the person who stood for everything she despised?" "ln that heartbeat, she found the courage." "So her thoughts were exactly this.." "Love me and free my soul." "l love you and adore you..." "...and I don't know any other way of living." "Of lovingl" And I counted 1 yawns, 3 snores and 1 dead person. A very senior writer, friend and philosopher ...once said to me, "People come to book reading.." "..to know more about the author." So I'm thinking let's you and me have a conversation. Let's just talk. What do you say? I have a question for you? - Yes, sure. How close to your personal life is your writing? Have you ever been in love? Umm. Let's see. Class 3, Class 1, 12, college.. Three years ago. Kiran, Vikram, Hussain, Kkrish and Andy. Yes, I have a question. - Yes. Why do you write such conventional and idealistic love stories? Because, our lives are so crowded and often, love between two people gets lost in it. So I thought there's one way to save love. Write it down in the pages of a book and sell it. What I am trying to say is that love nowadays is just a four-letter word Thank youl "The heart sometimesmconfuses me.." "And...l'll be really grateful if..." "Understand what's it sayingmand tell men" "And...l'll be really grateful..." "l'll be really gratefulu" "lf you just let your heart expressu" "uwhat you could never say." "Just like I am for you... You're for me." "Just like I am for you... You're for me." "lf we keep meetingmlike thisu" "Love might just seek us out." "The heart's deceptive..." "Why did it skip a beatmhearing about it?" "It's no longer in my control." "Since the heart's stuck on you." Let's take a picture? - Of course. Patel Value. "Just like I am for you... You're for me." "Just like I am for you... You're for me." Yeah, babyl Yudil "l'll be really gratefulu" "First I request... then miss you.." "l think only about you." "l don't love you.." "..still I always want you around me." "It's nothing... yet, there's something." "Since we met, the heart feels..." "Just like I am for you... You're for me." "Just like I am for you... You're for me." "YOI-Fre for mg " "YOI-Fre for mg " "l'll be really gratefulu" So, everything fine or not? - Yes and no. Why does this always happen with you? First, you were confused about Vishakha. Now it's Aanchal. Shut up, Montu. There's no confusion this time. I suggest you do a full background check on her. If she falls in love with you.. ...Il will just spell trouble. - No chance. She's just like me. - Like you? Wowl Then this will be the best relationship of your life. Yeahl If she's so smart, why is she giving you so much attention? Let me tell you something. Girls love projects. And what better project than me? That's true. That's very true. Aanchal. Hey, what's happening? Nothing, I'm free. - Heyl You're not free, okay? Do what? - Have a drink with me. Done. We'll meet at 9. Yudi, don't go - Bye. Don't go, Yudil Yudi, what the helll You know how tough it's been to get permission to go out I won't be able to do this after I become a father. Please let me go. Aanchal's leaving tomorrow. It's her farewell dinner. Tomorrow on, we're together. - Fine, go. I know you don't love me. - Semi Vicky, could you keep an eye on my friend, please? He's very depressed. Sweetheart, why so sad? - Married, thank you. Almost done. Just two more minutes. One more minute. Yeah. So what were you saying? So. Suddenly, in the middle of the jungle Oh manl Sorryl And I left poor Montu alone for this? Flight details Almost done. Done. So, tell me. - Forget it. Oh come on, tell me. I'm listening. Reallyl Okay, so suddenly, in the middle of the jungle, ...a tiger? Or a bear? Dinosaur? Okay, let's say it was an elephant. Suddenly he saw that an ele... Yudi, my phonel Yudi.. Yudi, I need the I'm sorry. Sorryl Nol Nol Did this belong to one of your ex-girlfriends? But she's not here. You can wear them. No, I don't want them. Fine, you come out as you are. I love a naked girl in my bedroom. What's all this? Don't touch anything, pleasel Wowl You wrote these? Yes. Once upon a time, I used to be a writer. Why haven't you completed any of it? - Couldn't find happy endings. Not every story needs a happy ending. Not bad. You do work hard. It's bad for my image. Keep them back, please. - Fine. And please don't tell anyone. Can you play, or is it just to strike a pose? Of course. I'm not a total fake. Really? I wonder. Actually, I always wanted to be a rockslar. Yeah, I've heard that story. So sing something. - Now? No. I feel shy. Why? Don't know how? I'm a legend. The world just never got it. Reay? Ready? Wowl - I wrote that song in.. Okay, it's Led Zeppelin. Yeah. But seriously. Anything. "L was 16...and she was beautifulu" And I bought this guitar to impress her. Very impressed. - Thank you. So...was she impressed? - No. And I bought this guitar for no reason. Funny. Okay, seriously. - Seriously. I don't remember it, but - BuL. What are the words? "It was in one of the drawers." "It was right here... but now it's lost." "It shouldn't have happened." "My heart's gone missing." "My senses were a bit dusty." "That was my only fault." "Let it bemwhafs gone, is gone." "It was useless anyway." "Welcomemmy beloved." "My heart... - It's your punishment." Are you sure you can't stay for few more days? - I wish I couldl "Welcomemmy beloved." "Welcomemmy beloved." "Welcomemmy beloved." "Welcomemmy beloved." AanchaL. Yeah? You know? Yeah? When are you back? I don't know. I have no plans. Do you have any plans of coming to India? - Not right now. But I will, one day. Okay. Thanks, for everything. I had fun. So I'll see you tomorrow before I leave, right? I have to meet Armaam. Deadlines You know how it is. - I know. No problem. I'll try. - It's okay. So bye, I guess? Bye. That turned out such an anti-climax. - It's correct. We decided not to complicate the situation. But you want her to come back. Why haven't you answered your phone? Sorry, must be somewhere inside. What are you doing here? Where's your husband? - I left himl What? For me? - Shut upl I'm not leaving until he comes here and apologizes lo me. That could take weeksl - So is that a problem? That's fine. That's fine. I'll take your bed, you take the couch, okay? Actually, I have a backache. That bed is specifically designed for me. Yudi, I've only heard this crap a few million limes. Besides, you could sleep on the floor, it's really good for the back. So basically, the first time I feel something for a girl.. And she's leaving. - Oh my Godl You're in love with her. - I don't know if it's love. That's your problem. You never accept your feelings. If you go on like this ...you'll slay alone all your life. Anyway, can I ask you something? Can you live without her? - Of course. I can live without anyone. I don't need anybody. Let me put it in a different way. Will you miss her if she leaves? Maybe. - That's it. It's love. This is love? Well, not for the rest of the world. But for your standards, this is enough. Since it's established you're in love-ish with her.. - But we.. Shhl I think now that it's clear. You should go tell her. Seriously, Yudi. Slop living your life like a comedy. Live it like a love story. Kickass line. I should write that down. My kick and you're fooll You're in lovel Mommy. - Oh, honey. Come here. Come here, honey. You okay? Look who's here? Daddy's herel Okay, come on, let's give you your bag. Come on, honey. Come onl - Daddyl Daddyl Take care, okay? Listen, Divya. I know I hurt you bad. I never said this properly. But I'm really sorry. Can you say that again, please? I really am sorry. Its okay, I wasn't any less, either. You know? Anyway, come here. - I'll get crushed. Come on. Give me a hug. You take care of yourself, okay? - You too. She's leaving. Aanchal. - I know. You think I should - Yes, I think you should. The Airport Climax never fails. What rubbishl - That's how the world works. Don't try to change the rules. Look, no one knows why.. But, the Airport Climax Scene always works. But they won't let me inside. Buy a cheap ticket to somewhere. I could always call and stop her. - That'll just kill the effect. Nonsensel Sir. - Be back in a minute, buddy. Look at that guy. Driving like an maniac. And people blame us taxi drivers. As if the road is his father's property. Heyl Stop the cabl - Stupid lndianl Stop the cabl I'll show you who's the real Michael Schumacherl Aanchall Aanchall You? - Tell him to stop. What are you doing here?l - Tell that moron to stopl Careful, you might hurt someone. - No, madam. We will win this race. What is he doing? - I know him. Stopl Stopl - You know this fool? Yesl Please stop the car. You could've said this before. What are you doing here? I've got something to tell you. Please don't. You don't even know what I'm going to say. - I don't want to know. You won't even give me a chance? Don't ruin it, Yudi. Reay? - It's easier said than done. And we don't believe in all this, right. No falling in love, remember? But I can change. Maybe I'm not just talking about you. Iam not ready for this, Yudi. And I know you aren't either. Trust me on this. You'll thank me for this later. We'll still be friends. "Boasts all the time." "But turns out to be a dud." "Bad luck sent a gift." "But he was really happy to see it." "Even after hearing his doom calling.." "...stupid fool asks what is that?" "Bro...you're such a pussycat." "A big oaf and spoil brat." "You've no reason to chat." "Bro...you're such a pussymcat." What are you doing, Yudi? What's wrong with you? That's enough. Thank you for getting me here, Yudi. I'm so happy you're back in your senses. Your depression made my life boring. But yeah, how long will I cry over one girl? Did I give her a dollar less? Let's do something wild. Don't answerl Ohl Oh, so what's wrong with him? - Unfortunately he's had an anxiety attack. - Oh my Godl Hey, Yudi. - Hi. What happened? I'm pregnant. Shootl I'm so sorry. He's dying, isn't he? He's dying, right? If anything happens to him, I'll be all alone. No, Montu, he isn't dying. Then what happened? I'm pregnant with your child. Oops baby? How? What do you mean by how? What's going on? Why are all the women getting pregnant at the same time? Is this some kind of flu? Shut up, Montu. Please. Now we're really brothers. My wife and your Vishakha, are both pregnant. Didn't I always tell you, Yudi? No matter how many girls you fool around with.. ...you'll end up marrying her. Relax, relax, I'm just joking. Relax. I love you, Yudi. You're my best friend. Please don't diel - Don't worry. You aren't wearing anything below? - No. So what are you going to do? Vishakha's pregnant, I can't abandon her now. I have to do the right thing. Let's try to get a hold of your life. You're going to marry the girl you don't love.. Because she's pregnant with your child. The girl you loved is now the mother of three kids and stays at your place with her kids whenever she wants. And the girl you love now.. Is treating you the exact same way you treated all your girlfriends so far. Karma is being bitchy. So what's your point? There's no point. You're just screwed, that's all. Idioll "They say love dwells in every heart." "Someone just needs to find it." "You never know when one falls in love." "When the eyesmmeet." "The distance made me realizeu" "..how close you're to me." Surprisel Happy birthdayl Yudi cutiepiel I got him goodl Everybody's here. Thanks. "Happy birthday to youl" She's nice. Okay. HI. Montu.

I mean close friends. Iam pregnant with his child. HGY- . H9Y- Yudi pudie pie. I love you. You've never once said "l love you" to me. You know what? I don't want to marry you. Come on, Vishakha. - No. If you're marrying me out of pity, I don't want any of it. It's not pity, this is our kid. - Yudi.. I'm not pregnant. I'm sorry? Whafil I lied to you. What?l - I know. I'm having a panic attack again. But why? Why? - Because I thought it was the only way. You'd have never said yes otherwise. But such a big lie? Have you lost your mind? Vishakha, that's just mean. You're crazyl You have a right to be angry. Say what you need to say. I could've got a heart attack. I could've diedl Don't worry. You won't die so easily. You love yourself too much. I'll just mail it to you. - Don't worry about it. You should go to her. - And do what? Tell her that you love her. I've said it once already. You want me say it again? You'll have to say it from the heart. And prove you really love her. Prove to whom? Them. Who? - Them. Them. What? Prove to the whole world, the universe ...that you've changed, and that you love this girl. But before that, you have to really change from the inside. How much more do I have to change? Change can't be measured. It can only be felt. In movies, this is so easy Music does half the work.. And everything's fine in a minute or two. But there's no option for poetry in life. The last few years, I started many books.. ...never finished even one. I was afraid that Ending should not be bad. See. I don't like endings. If I don't write ending then atleast hope remains. This time, I'll have to commit to one story honestly. S0 what if I fail? At least I won't be scared anymore. Oh no. No. No. You actually wrote the script. I thought I'd have to return their advance. I even got my cheque book. Remember, don't stare. Come. I said, don't stare. Hello. What's this? The script. Come narrate it to me. On the beach. He is convinced he's unable to finish the book.. Because he can never start it. Suddenly Suddenly, he realizes that silence is the best poem. And he wrote it down Cut to widel A red convertible enters in slow motion. And them. Jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, closel He wears his sunglasses, lights up his cigarette, A superhit song starts, That's the hero's reentry. In high speed, another red convertible screeches to a halt. There's this stunning beauty sitting inside. Cut to your close. Cut to her close. Cut to your close. Cut to her close. He's playing a song for her on the guitar. Soft musicl And it strikes a chord in the girl's heart. She turns around, and it starts to rain. He's wandering around like a madman, missing her. Rain continues. He looks towards the sea and smiles. Methinks, one day One day. Then? What then? That's all I wrote. - What? Where's the ending? I haven't found the ending. I'm going in search of it. "L found it... - But I didn't know it." "Since I knew you.. - I forgot everything else." "l found it... - But I didn't know it." "Since I knew you.. - I forgot everything else." What do you want? - Aanchal. Ma'am. Someone hereto see you. So, what are you doing here? Well, I was in the neighborhood. So I thought I'd just say hi. Okay. Hello. HI. Are you done with your script? - Well, almost. I couldn't find the ending. That's why I'm here. - Oh. I thought you came hereto see me. I have a few notes. - Of the climax? For you. Me? You said don't ruin things by saying it. So I wrote it down. I'm a writer, after all. I need to read what I've written, ...to really understand. Read it. "If you want to learn how to swim, you have to jump into the water." "How long will I to sit in my boat scared of.." Okay, that's rubbish. It was just warm-up. It's nonsense. Read the next one. They say opposites attract. It's a lie. Everywhere, we look for a reflection of us. If you ever do find one, treasure it, keep it safe. Oh nonsensel The best line just flew away. - Sorry. You know, Aanchal. I'm not asking you to spend the rest of your life with me. Who wants a lifelong commitment? Let's take a day at a time. We won't think about the future or look at the past. We'll just take care of the present. And before you know it, we'd have spent the rest of our lives AanchaL. I love You okay? Yeah. Good. So, I said I love you. Do you have something to say? Thanks. Thanks? Are you serious? What? - I mean, it was hard for me to say that l.. "They say love dwells in every heart." "Someone just needs to find it." By the way you didn't answer my question. You said lets take a day at a time. So only today. We can think about tomorrow later. Oh really? Every story can have a happy ending. If you end it at the right time. For now, this is The End to my story. "L found it... I came all the way from America just for you. Even forever seemed like an hour waiting for you. Now, no one can separate us. I love you, baby doll. Aaand CUTI Mind-blowing, Armaanji. Superbl Did you understand what I said? - Not really. Come to the van, I'll explain it to you. Thanks. They should have casted Aliya. By paying ten million rupees or so more. She's a bit old. Excuse me, Sir, I didn't write that dialogue. What is he saying? First time, right? - BuL. It's okay. Superb, Sir. Superb. - Thanks. How was it? Nice. How are the dialogues coming? Kickassl "Boasts all the time." "But turns out to be a dud." "Bad luck sent a gift." "But he was really happy to see it." "Even after hearing his doom calling.." "...stupid fool asks what is that?" "Bro...you're such a pussycat." "A big oaf and spoil brat." "You've no reason to chat." "Bro...you're such a pussymcat." "l wonder what your destiny... has in store for you." "Son...you're stuckmin your own trap." "A little girlmbowled you over." "And you just held to your bat." "Bro...you're such a pussycat." "A big oaf and spoil brat." "You've no reason to chat." "Bro...you're such a pussymcat."
