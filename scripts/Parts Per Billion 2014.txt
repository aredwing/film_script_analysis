As last night's report of a series of large explosions awaits official confirmation, widespread fear of a biological weapons launch continues to spread throughout the region. Justine, what are you seeing in the capital? The Foreign Ministry remains shuttered for a second day as evidence mounts that the insurgents may have used at least some part of their long-rumored biological weapons stockpile in the course of last night's incursion. Have you been able to get any word yet on the government's response? Well, it's hard to find any officials here at all in the capital, Mark. But those who are willing to speak off the record confirm the regime's plan for a massive retaliation in the next five to seven days. Well, while we are trying to restore that image, ITL News has just obtained amateur video footage purporting to show casualties from last night's exchange of missile fire. A warning... this footage contains images that may be disturbing to some viewers. Obtained from a junior military officer fleeing the site of last night's clashes, it seems to belie assurances from both sides of the conflict - that no chemical or biological weapons... - Damn it. Have been deployed. Such images are horrifying enough, but there's an even more horrific scenario if the contagion spreads beyond the region, potentially infecting tens... if not hundreds of thousands. - They're saying... - Look, I'm... if you want, I'm just gonna go to the guitar shop. The pickup fried out, so... They can't just keep fighting, right? We are now going live to a press conference at the Centers for Disease Control. As of 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, the CDC has not measured any airborne contaminants beyond a 100-mile radius of last night's advance in the Middle East. What this... what this means is the continental United States has not and will not be affected by the reported use of these pathogens. Steven, the situation in the larger cities near the epicenter of the conflict remains tense as persistent rumors of mass deaths in scores of towns and villages gain credibility. At least three regional governments have begun issuing gas masks... Rumors abound in the capital as the prime minister and his cabinet depart the city... This is simply a precaution in order for us to maintain government function... Meanwhile, a veritable exodus of refugees continues to stream across regional borders, desperately seeking safety from a threat that remains, perhaps intentionally, undefined. In Washington, the president has issued a statement urging calm and affirming that no known pathogen poses any threat... The trade winds are spreading the pathogen well beyond the conflict's borders, confirming officials' worst fears about the airborne virus. Reports of mass casualties as far north as Italy and Portugal are pending confirmation. What we're apparently seeing here is a virus, or a complex of viruses, killing some almost immediately, while leaving others fully mobile. However, within hours, nobody in the affected area remains alive. Stay tuned, please, for further developments on this breaking news story. That pickup's all right. But when I move around... it doesn't have that punch and it's just fading out a lot. - Don't worry... - All right, so... Okay, cool. Thanks, man. He says it's gonna be, like, an hour. There's something... - I am so hungry. - Oh. I don't even know why we're fighting this thing. - It was the fucking dishes. - Yes! You guys have maids, you know? So it's not like you see a dirty dish and you're like, "Hey, here's a dirty dish. I've got to do something about it. I'm gonna wash this dirty dish." - You're... - What are you... I mean... You're totally fixated on this. It's not the dish. I'm not even talking about the dish anymore. It's a metaphor. - Yeah, it's a metaphor... - I know what you're gonna say. - No, you don't. - The dish is a metaphor for my anxiety about how different we are. What? - You did know. - Well, of course I knew. - So, fuck it. - Just wash the dish. Just metaphor the metaphor. Just address my anxieties with dishwashing liquid. We'd miss this if we ever lost it. We'd be like, "I wish we could go back to when the worst thing we had to worry about was the dishes." Hey. Hey. Oh, my God. You guys, congratulations! Let me see. Oh, my God. That is so adorable. So what's going on with this shit in the news? - Honestly, I'm not watching it. - Don't know, right? - Nothing's changed. - I am going to go to the bathroom. Oh. Ahem. Although state and county authorities have been almost unanimous in urging residents to remain calm, a spreading, seemingly spontaneous exodus along the Eastern Seaboard has caused state highway patrol officials to shut down six major northbound arteries, piecing together... Traffic's insane out there. Did you guys eat my food? I got you this. Anna, why have you been so freaked out lately? So, what, I'm not allowed to talk to any girl I've ever slept with? Are you gonna go crazy? Is that it? No, it's the exact opposite. I think you should talk to all the people you want to... any girl you've ever met, whenever they call, whenever they stop by, whenever you bump into them. Yeah, I think you should take as many opportunities as possible to talk to them. Jesus, Anna. Because, God, there is so much time, isn't there? There is so much time between all the dishes lying around, the fucked-up amps, the fried-out pickups, your rich grandparents... and your boring, stupid ex-girlfriends coming to the "Gates of fucking India"? You know? Because between all that, there's so much time for... laying in the bathtub... and reading the soap bottle... and looking out together, up at the leaves... and holding each other, because we're both so happy that we're actually scared. Because if it really is all over... Erik, if it was just us, and there really was nothing left on Earth... What are you doing? No, Anna, Anna, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's the song. That... that is the song. Those are the lyrics to our song. That's it. It's gonna be beautiful. No one is willing to confirm or deny what we're seeing here. It clearly isn't benign. Even at this distance, David, I've got to admit, I'm scared. We're getting unconfirmed reports of rioting at dozens of airports as all domestic and international flights remain grounded. Hundreds of thousands of people are now running through the streets here seeking any kind of shelter. The president and his cabinet have been evacuated to an undisclosed location while assuring local authorities... as yet another American city reports an almost unbelievable casualty rate... I, the Lord, have held My peace a long time... Just in the last several minutes, it's really... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We are no longer receiving reports from the following cities and municipalities... Boston and the Boston metropolitan area, - Bridgeport and the... - Philadelphia... - Baltimore... - "Then the fifth angel poured out his bowel on the throne of the beast, and His kingdom became full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain..." - Jesus Christ! - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - "They shall become refuse on the ground." The following is a bulletin from the Emergency Management Agency. If concentrations in your area have exceeded 80 parts per billion, you must take immediate shelter and remain where you are for a minimum of eight days. State authorities will continue to broadcast hourly updates as long as emergency networks remain operational. What does that even mean, "parts per billion"? Per billion what? Per billion of whatever else was out there, I guess. It's a beautiful day. Not a cloud in the sky. We could read something. Sure. Remember this? Oh, that. That was a moment of weakness. Well, at least we're not going to get divorced now. It's so clear out, baby. The birds up there, they're just flying around. It's too bad we aren't birds. I wonder what they're feeling. Like their favorite TV show got canceled. I could talk to you for another 20 years. Aw, shut up. I mean it. I was just thinking it the other day. I just realized that... that you're my wife. It took me practically till just now to really believe it. We're going to have to go to Children's. What? There are no more canisters here. We're going to have to go to Children's Hospital. Okay. - Oh, my God. - Don't look. Oh, God. That looks like... that sweet nurse in Cardiology. Sarah. Her name was Sarah. Sarah. Sarah? Sarah. Sarah. - Mr. Sachs, I... - Wait a minute. Look, I know you're busy, but I need a favor from you. It's for my wife. She's in there waiting to see Dr. Henderson. They took her off life support. They took her out of ICU. We're just waiting, Sarah. Well, we have an emergency... Well, this is an emergency! You understand?! This is an emergency, Sarah! She's dying! And the doctor's just taken a three-hour coffee break. - Mr. Sachs... - I'm sorry. I know you're a good person. Esther and I really think of you as someone close to us, like you're really family. Please, I'm begging you. Just come with me. Help me. Help me get her to ICU. Come on. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that. We have an emergency... Mr. Sachs? Mr. Sachs! Jacob! Get me an oxygen unit. - Jacob, get me an oxygen unit, now. - Yes, right. Mr. Sachs? Lift your head up for me. Try to breathe normally. - Okay? - Yeah. - I've gotta go. - Wait, wait. Listen to me. It's a biological attack. - Isn't it? - They don't know. People can't breathe... old people... kids... animals are okay. We only have about three hours... It has to do with how much material is in the air. And winds and... if it gets up to more than 35 parts per billion, you're going to need one of these to survive, Sarah. Now listen to me. Listen. You got to get one. Not a charcoal filter. Pure oxygen. You'll be able to last eight days. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Good luck. Nurse! I have to go! "Connect me to something. Give me something," I said. You know? "Give me something, Counsel. Give me something that connects my client eating baba ghanoush at some streetside cafe somewhere in... do we even know where this was taken, Tracy?" And then Tracy said... And then I said, "No, the prosecution just gave us Exhibit 345, defendants Hightower, Esselen, and Sachs and 'unidentified man.' 1979." "So, please. Help me out here," I said, looking sort of baffled. "Give me whatever it is you're hanging your case on so that I can defend my client. But don't keep giving me exhibit after exhibit, so-called 'fact' after so-called 'fact' that doesn't add up to A... trade secrets, B... any of your employees actually compromising your trade secrets, or C... any material damages done to your company's overseas interests, because if opposing counsel doesn't or can't, or for whatever reason, they won't... Your Honor, I respectfully request that you dismiss the case against my client." And the judge dismissed it. You guys? We're... we're evacuating the building. The news, then a proliferation of rumors and hearsay, and then almost street by street... Hey, man. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Hey, man. I'm leaving a message, dude. Did you... if you're watching TV, there's a... anyway, turn on the TV. It has something to do with the war. We're supposed to... conflicting reports of trade winds... So, um... meet me back at the house. And... please change your outgoing message, though, baby. Seriously. But efforts to keep citizens calm and encourage them to maintain their normal... I'm gonna take you left, then right... - Ah! - Busted! Surprise myself! Ah! Take it back right here. And then I'm gonna score again. Perfect defense. Oh, yeah! That's game, baby! - No, no, no. - That's game. No. Okay, so here's the deal. If I sink this, right here, you let me pay you back. You don't owe me anything, man. You see, that's exactly the kind of talk that won't be allowed if I make this shot. What happens if you miss? Uh... You know, this is really gonna determine my inner morality. If I miss, then you never have to hear about it again. How's that? Okay? Borrowed your Jeep, fucked up the transmission, we're square. But if I make it, you accept the cash. All right, I'll trust your subconscious. You hear that, Rick's subconscious? You don't really want him to make this shot, do ya? Make him miss. You're just... you're gonna stand right there? You never said anything about where I could stand. - Okay. Okay. - Oh, I'm sorry. It doesn't really matter. That doesn't bother me. - 'Cause you know why? - Why? 'Cause I got it like that. I give up. Nice work on the Sachs case. Thanks. Where are you going? Home. That's it? That's it. Whatever. Let's not end this on a bad note. You're a wonderful guy, and who knows what would have happened if we had met before. But it was never a question. There was in my mind. I'm sorry. It's the end of the world. If it really is the end of the world, how funny, you know? For once, it really would be when it feels that way. How romantic. Anyway, turn on the TV. It has something to do with the war. Meet me back at the house and please change your outgoing message, though, baby. - Come on, come on. Let's go. - Seriously. I'm starting to tighten up a little bit. Let's go. What? She told me to turn on the TV. - She wants me to meet her at home. - Now? Yeah. - So you're...? - Sorry, man. You know what, man? You are so fuckin' whipped. Hey, I canceled a lot of shit for this so we can just hang out. Yeah? Like what? Coffee at Saga? Tarot card reading? - Yeah. - I'll see you on Thursday. - You gotta be kiddin' me. - I'll see you Thursday, man. Yeah, fuck you, motherfucker. - Thursday. - If you're lucky. God damn it. Hey. I finished the song. I have an idea. Why don't we take a nap, just forget about everything? Listen to this. "The souls of all my dears have flown to the stars. Thank God there's no one left for me to lose." Hm. You know what your grandmother said to me? Mm. She said... that "the only important language spoken in the world is spoken between a man and a woman. In bed." I don't know. Maybe you want to watch the news? - Nuh-uh. - Or write some more poetry? No. You know what? We should probably get up and do the dishes. No, I don't think so. And so, finally... eight years later or whatever... at some New Year's Eve party, Grandpa finally got up the courage and he kissed her. At least, that's how my mom used to tell it. They're gonna love you. Seriously. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried, baby. - Hello! - Hi! - Hello! - Hi! I'm so glad to meet you. I'm so happy to meet you, too. Yes! Goodness! Ooh! Someone did very well. This is a beautiful ring. - That's right. - He did very great. How are you, sweetheart? Men are so much like kids, it's silly. I mean, there's the guitar and there's the garden and there's basketball and football... it's a wonder they have any time at all to devote themselves to other responsibilities for family. But they do. They do. - Yeah. - Bless 'em. You know. I'm gonna have to sit down, I think. - I just got a little pooped. - Yeah, sure. What you've gotta watch, of course, is when you breed something more and more specialized, it can only survive under very narrow and specific conditions. Here. Thank you. - Got something for you. - No, Grandpa, I'm fine. - No, no, no. - I'm fine. No, no, you can't refuse me. You just can't. I'm not gonna take no for an answer, - so you might as well just stop. - Okay. And I wanna tell you something... man to man, okay? No matter how much a woman may tell you that she's happy to support you, that she's not interested in material things, she wants you to be free... sooner or later, they all want the good things in life. - I know, I know. But Anna isn't like that. - Well, I'm sure she's not. I'm not telling you that she's shallow. Probably is the most natural, basic instinct in a woman... actually, any human being... make a home, make a nest. You know, I'm playing a show at this thing. It's called "South by Southwest." And you know there's a lot of... record company people, and managers go. That's wonderful. - I can make a living playing music. - I'm sure you can. And I'm sure you'll figure it out. Don't let anybody pressure you, huh? Just take your time. If there's anything ever I can do to help you, you know I'm here. So funny... I was just thinking this morning that, God, I have turned into such a typical "girl." I never thought it would happen to me, but I... oh, God... I am completely obsessed with him. Beyond obsessed with him. I mean, even when I'm angry or jealous or, I don't know... maybe that's the same thing... but he leaves for an hour and I can't stand it. I don't know what to do with myself. I feel kind of crazy and... that can't be healthy. Well, I'm not sure it's healthy, but it is the way it is. - Yeah. - Yeah? And I'll tell you something else. You'd be someplace at a party or a friend's house or something... and he'll be over there talking to somebody. And you see his face. And you think, "He and I are going to make some beautiful babies." - Cheers. - Cheers. You know what? I don't think I can take this. No, no. I told you I'm not taking no for an answer. - No, Grandpa, I can't. - Oh, Erik, come on. I got it, you need it. - What's the difference? - I always appreciate... I am not taking it back. That's final. - I'm sorry. - Idiot. You're too good for my dirty money? You think there wouldn't be such a thing as war if it wasn't for me? I got news for you, kid. There are worse sinners on this earth - than your grandfather. - No, no, no. I don't... Wait till you have a child! Wait till you have a sick child! Then you'll lecture me. And if you have any trouble at all remembering or if you aren't sure of your answer, just say, "I don't remember," or, "I don't have any specific recollection." Now, that last one actually covers quite a lot. If, for instance, you "sort of" think you might remember something, but it's possible that you aren't remembering it clearly, it's never perjury to say, "I don't have any specific recollection." They were developing a pathogen. I know, Mr. Sachs. But the prosecution won't be asking about that tonight. It wasn't even my division. I offered advice to my clients on pharmaceutical lines. Okay. We have about 15 minutes until opening statements. They just offered me so much money. So much. Millions. Okay. Mr. Sachs, look at me. This trial is not about how certain governments got a hold of certain weapons or formulas for weapons over 30 years ago. This trial deals with the very narrow issue of whether or not you violated your contract with Sichel Systems by revealing trade secrets, and you didn't do that. You didn't break the terms of your contract. You're innocent. Have you had a child? - No. - You can't watch them die. She lived another 15 years and she gave us our grandson, Erik. But the prosecution doesn't need to know that, do they? I took it. I took the money. I knew it was wrong, but I took it. My wife is living in denial, but I know it's my fault. I deserve to be punished. We really need to leave, Mr. Sachs. Oh, my God. Oh... it's too far. We'll get there, we'll get there. Hold on. If we can find some more canisters up there, it's gonna get us eight days of air, and the poison will be gone. To think I was so scared about having that operation. And Dr. Henderson died... Esther, if you're going to go through all the ironies of the situation, we're going to be talking another 20 years. You know that? I won't say a word. I don't ever want to say anything. What? What did you say? Excuse me? You don't want to say anything? Huh? You don't wanna say anything... about my pants? Something about my pants? They're too high. Okay, here we go. Have you been looking for a job? Yeah, I've been looking for a job. I print out another 175,000 resumes, I change my profile on another million job sites. - I mean, the thing is... - I even call Human Resources. I swear to God, I feel like "Willy Loman." I said... "If anything comes up, do me a favor. Keep my number. Give me a call." I mean, you were getting plenty of work when you were putting her through law school. Yeah. People used to hire writers. You can get any job you want. Yeah. One more job. Pay some bills. Buy some stuff, get another job, pay some more bills, buy some more stuff... Yeah, but it's that or what? Play basketball with your buddies all day and let Mia buy your shirts? You know what's interesting to me, is that why... instead of printing a bunch of resumes, why we all don't just stop in the middle of the street and say... "What the hell is going on here? What is this all about?" I mean, why am I here on this earth, you know? - Oh, Len... - No, I mean it. I mean it. Why does the universe expand for eternity? Wh-why... how much longer am I gonna live? Why am I the only animal that knows it's gonna die? We all asked ourselves those questions when we were, like, eight. Yeah, but why did we stop asking, you know? 'Cause I never got any answers. Is this about the war? This is about what I'm supposed to be doing with my life. I just don't know what I'm supposed to tell Dad. Oh, God, Sarah. Tell him I'm happy. I mean, you tell me... X-ray vision... am I horribly depressed? You know what I just realized the other day? We're at some party at Mia's office and we'd just gotten in some stupid fight and we're outside in the parking lot. And I just realized that... she's my wife. And I love her. I mean, I really love her. She married me... so I can't really be that depressed, can I? God. I hope I meet someone like you someday. - Except with a job. - Except with a job. Come on. Come on! Fuck. Shit. Mia? Sarah, what the fuck is going on? Listen... they're not telling the whole story on the news. Well, I haven't seen the news. What's going on? Just ignore what everybody's saying. You have to get back to the house. Get out your dehumidifiers and ionizers... anything you have that filters air... and seal yourself into the basement. What... what is it? Is this the war? Just listen. Remember how we put Mom's oxygen tanks up in the attic? Yeah. I got rid of those months ago, Sarah. Damn. Well, just stay down there as long as you can. I'm starting to freak out here, Sarah. What's going on? How do you know all this? Because I... I met someone who knows about this, - and I... - Hey, Sarah? Sarah, listen to me, okay? What the fuck? Hold on a second. I gotta give you a call back, okay? I'm gonna call you back. Stay safe. Attention, please. There has been an emergency reported in the building. Leave the building immediately using marked stairways and exits. Do not use elevators. Hey, buddy. Do you know where your mommy and daddy are? You okay? Using marked stairways and exits. Do not use elevators. Attention, please. Attention, please. There has been an emergency reported in the building. Leave the building immediately using marked stairways... It hurts. What hurts? My tummy. Where does it hurt? Hmm? It... Okay, okay, buddy. Okay. Uh... we're gonna... What the fuck are you doing? - Hey... - Get the fuck away from my boy! Hey, man, it's okay. Your kid is not doing... hey, whoa! Hey, hey... hey, listen! Jesus Christ! Hey, listen, man! - Listen! - Fuck you... - Daddy! - Damn it! Listen! Listen! Jesus Christ, man! Stop! Listen to me. Take care of your son! Hey, do you have any Goldfish? - Um... - Yes, Goldfish. Maybe up there. Thanks. Uh...? Wow. Do you think that they stuffed everything up like that for the party? No, I think that is just how they keep their things. - You know what's weird about that? - What? Oh, shh... Oreos. - Look at this. - Mmm. - Mmm. - Mmm, mmm. Yummy, yummy. What's... - What's weird? - Huh? - What's weird about it? - What's weird, what's weird. - You said... - It was... I don't know. It's just weird... ever since we got engaged, there's suddenly like all these... I don't know, these waves that we... No. I know exactly what you mean. There's, like, a right way and a wrong way of doing everything, and we're, like... You know why? It's 'cause we're, like, we are like, the Anna and Erik tribe. You know? And I mean there's something terribly wrong about putting the... look, the cat food next to the tea. Yeah, but probably the way we stack things and put things together really neatly seems completely insane and constricting. - Right? - Yeah, yeah. I mean it already feels so wrong to do it any other way than the way we do it. Right, but that is how it begins, you know? That is why countries invade each other... 'cause of that. "You don't put the tea in the right place." Yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you, you're the bad guys. You have no idea how to do it, and we're better. "You know what? The green tea goes on the top shelf next to the cocoa, fuckwad, or I'm gonna kill you." The beginning of civilization. I'm sorry. I have got to move this. - No, I mean, it so doesn't belong there. - There is something immoral about it. - We'd be hypocrites if we fail that. - Future generations will thank us. The products of this apartment will cry out for liberation. It will be a beacon of proper shelf arrangement for the entire region. Oh, my God. So good. I can't find the Goldfish. He was up there. God. I hear you. Hi. Hi. - Was I talking to myself? - No. I've been feeling so weird these past few days. You know... I see stuff. Out of the corner of my eye sometimes. I don't even tell my boyfriend... my fianc. And these past few days, I... I mean literally, last night, for a second, it was like there was nobody left anywhere... except animals. Running down the middle of the street. God, and Erik was like, "What? What are you staring at?" You didn't say? They say schizophrenia starts when you're, like, 19 to 25. You hear voices? Well, I just heard a bunch of crows screaming "War! War!" Well, they aren't telling you to jump off any high buildings, right? No. Good. My name is Rick. I'm Anna. I've considered the high building option. But life is so absurdly short, anyway. Yeah, I've been thinking that. Makes you only want to do the important things. But what are the important things? I'm pregnant. First time I've told anybody. - Greyhound. - You got it. Vodka and grapefruit. Here you go. Thank you. You don't know what a Greyhound is? Hey, who got us this job? So, anyway, all I'm saying is marriage is just all of these artificial restrictions. It's like going on some radical diet when you're not even fat. All I'm saying is, yes, agreed, congratulations Anna is hot. She's incredibly hot. And, granted, you're probably not going to meet anybody who's that hot and whatever cool and interesting and wonderful. I don't know what you're talking about. You're making a scene. Well, what is he looking at, then? Right now he's looking at you. Having dragged me across the room and yelling at me - in front of all my coworkers... - I'm not yelling at you. Can I get a vodka and tonic? Brilliant, that's exactly right. - Yeah. - Fucking more alcohol because that's really going to help. Thank you. See? He probably thought he was marrying the most magical, beautiful girl on earth. It's up to you, man. I'm just saying you could be dealing with that kind of shit for the rest of your life. Or I could spend the rest of my life saying, "I met the one true love of my life when I was 22 years old and I was too scared - to ask her to marry me." - If she is the one true love of your life. I mean, there are billions of people. No, she's... she's the one true love of my life. Okay. So you have the rest of your life to ask her to marry you. Fuck. It happens every time. I get dressed up to come to a thing like this, and it's a fucking disaster. Len, none of these people matter to me. None of these people mean anything to me except you. Let's get out of here. Ah, fuck. Oh, God I need water. Water. Done. What's this? I got it at the museum. It's a trilobite. It's probably like 300 million years old. And now they just give them away with a $50 membership. There used to be billions of 'em. They must have had a lot of sex. They couldn't help themselves. They were in love. Or it was just instinct. Same thing, I guess. I'd have babies with you. I mean, not right away, but... we should, you know? What? I never said never. I said, "Don't marry me if you want to have children." But you would? I could. Yeah, I would. We should. - Right? - Right. Think of how beautiful it would be. "It"? She. She. Okay. We will. You promise? Not right away. But someday. Promise. Mia?! There you go. It's okay. Come here. So we need to... I need you to get everything out of the kitchen that you can, okay? I need you to just get everything that you can. Okay? I'm going to go upstairs and get some blankets. Okay? Gonna bring it down to the basement. Okay? Yeah? Sure. Okay. The following message is transmitted at the request of the United States government. This is not a test. All residents of the United States are strongly encouraged to establish... Gonna need some more tape. We've gotta seal all the windows up here, we've gotta seal the door. Does creme soda count as water? What? - Come on, sweetheart. - I'll just get that, okay? Let's get everything downstairs. It's all diet food. It's all fucking... low carb crap. All of it. It's okay, sweetheart. Hey, look... I have a chocolate bar in my pocket, okay? With almonds, okay? Go back downstairs. Okay? Go back downstairs. - Come on, sweetie. - Okay, okay, okay. I got it. Do you need this tape? - Nope. - Okay. Did you call Sarah? Mm-hmm. You okay down there, sweetheart? Ooh. Andy, it's... it's time to stop. I thought you didn't want to talk anymore. I just don't want to sit here watching you kill yourself. We'll get there. You see? If we can just make it up there, we're gonna find some more canisters, I know it. Stop that, Esther. Stop it, come on. Take your hand... Take your hand off the wheel. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but look. I've gotta... we can't afford the energy it takes to fight like this. I wish... I wish you would put more energy into finding solutions. There are no solutions, honey. The news broadcasts have stopped, and... everybody that we love is dead. Listen to me. Everyone I love is not dead. The only person on earth that I love is still alive. Oh, you're such a charmer. You could charm the knickers off of any girl. Well, there's no girls left but my girl. Okay. Here we go. I can't stand how much I miss you when I'm gone. I know. Oh... so, I got a new book that I really want to read to you. Okay. Wait, I don't know which one to read to you. Wow, that song is really good. Yeah, you know, I... Let me just read you one. What... you don't have to stop. I know, I know. I mean, I just, I just... I just wanted to show you something. In the park. I want your opinion on something that they're building across the river. Uh, what, before we go home? Yeah, yeah. It's just been bugging me. I pass it every day on my run, you know. Right. So do you want to look at it? Uh, sure. You don't want to hear this? No, no. Read it to me, read it to me. Ahem. "At the red towers of your native Sodom, the square where once you sang, the spinning shed, at the empty windows set into the house, where sons and daughters blessed your marriage bed. A single glance, a sudden dart of pain stitching her eyes before she made a sound. Her body flaked into transparent salt. Her swift legs rooted to the ground." Right? That's... that's incredible. - You're so distracted. - No, I'm not. I liked it. No, you have no idea what I just read to you. Not no idea. Come on. Hey. "Dilute." "Dilute. Dilute!" Dilute. Okay. Come on. Let's go see your weird-ass building. Okay. Uh... this looks right. See that... that big red building with the arches? It's that. - Oh. - Right next to it with the... The water tower, just right under that, there's like this cluster of red buildings. That red garage-looking thing? - Yeah. - I can't really see it. - Is it next to the... - Yeah. What am I looking at? Hey! I have to give this to you now. Oh, my God. What does that mean? What does that... is that a "yes"? You have to say yes if you're gonna... You still need to say "yes." I love you. I love you so much. Say yes. You need to say yes. Please. Look at you. You love me... Well, what do you think of our news? - What news? - Our news. Erik and Anna. Oh, that's fine. Oh, honey. You don't dislike Anna, do you? I think she's wonderful and I just love her. I'm just so happy about this. I like her fine. You know I offered him some money and he wouldn't take it? Oh, well, he's getting married. You know, he's going to be the big macho man now. Head of the family. He'll probably never take money from us again. Well, I bet if I made it in real estate or cattle ranching, he'd take it. What are you laughing at? Nothing... well, yes, I am. I'm thinking of you standing in the middle of a herd of cows. Very funny. Honey, don't do that. Oh! Oh, shit. God damn it. - Did you cut yourself? - No. Just leave it. I'll get it later. Come on over here, my darling man, and talk to me. What's the matter? Tell me what's really troubling you. I took their money. They wouldn't have paid me so much if they weren't gonna use my knowledge. Oh, no. You weren't working for them. You were just working at their laboratory. They wanted great scientists to work at their laboratory. It gives them prestige. I knew they were working on pathogens. They were just picking my brain. All I could think about was Liza. Listen. That money... gave Liza 15 more years of life. It gave her Erik. What if they use it, Esther? What if they use it and everybody dies? Well, I think you're going completely crazy. I really do, you know. You are not to blame for everything in this world, no matter how smart you are. And I'll tell you something else. I'm taking a little offense at this. I didn't marry a murderer. I married the kindest, gentlest, most loving man in the world. I don't think you ever knew just how much I love you. I swear, it... - Esther? - Ow...! - What is it, honey? - Ow! - Come on, Esther. Come on. Come. - Oh. No. - Come on, come with me. - I'm fine. I just got excited. Come on, come on. Let me take you. I'll take you upstairs. Okay, come on. One, two, three. - Here we go. - Oh...! Come on. Come on. I'm okay, really. Well, whatever it is, seven or eight days. When we're done with the water... and there's tangerine juice, too. When we're done with everything, then we go up. Even though the radio said eight days. Maybe we ought to make it seven. But what the fuck do they know, you know? Air could be clear at six. Clear enough, anyway, for me to go up and get supplies and come back down here. - What? - The last thing they said was... "200 million dead in Europe." So that's not everybody. Nothing's gonna be left, Len. We don't know that until we see. Len, nothing's left. The radio stopped. There's no more planes or helicopters. When's the last time you heard anything other than birds? We'll stay down here three more days. And then... - We'll drive to the marina. - No. We'll get a boat. We'll go out on the lake. And we'll keep going until we find someone. - I don't... - What? I don't wanna... wade through a bunch of corpses to go steal a boat to go look at more corpses lying on a bunch of docks. Even... even if we did make it, Len, what are we supposed to do? Do you really want to play "Adam and Eve"? Build it all back up so it all just gets destroyed again? Maybe people will learn. It's like that guy who hit you for trying to take care of his kid. It's like that guy I defended... great guy, good father, always showing me pictures of his grandson... who helped invent the shit that killed everyone. People aren't going to learn. It's something in us. It's something in the way that we're made. Then at least... we'll have more time. At least we'll go out on the water together. We'll find a boat with a nice, big cabin. Come on. Len? That guy, Jay, from the law firm? He fell in love with me. I never did anything. I never let him touch me. But I... you know, I... I made him think, I guess... that he had a shot at it. - Why? - It was just a way to... Just a way to pass the time? To feel better about myself, I guess. Why do you need to feel better about yourself? It wasn't about you. It was just my curse. Len. Why are they gonna stay down here like caged animals? Or we're gonna go upstairs tomorrow... and lie down on the grass. Breathe in... and die... when and where we choose. We'll eat the chocolate bar before we do it, okay? Okay? - Oh, my God. - What? What? Did you buy this weird soap? What? I seriously think I've found my new religion. Oh, yeah, that stuff. Wait, have you read this? No. I mean, the writing's so tiny... Wait a minute. Listen to this. "Einstein, 1939. After Nazis and Commies united, proposes 'space bombs' that destroys all unless we finally teach the moral ABCs the real Rabbi Hillel taught Jesus to unite all in, all one, God faith." Did you find a pay phone? I got some noodles. Just gotta add water. And some drinks. And there's these things... energy bars. And napkins. I couldn't find a pay phone. I don't think they make them anymore. What is this doing on a soap bottle? And where did you get this? I mean, it was at the health food store. - It was cheap. - "We're all one or none. There is no god but God. Teach 'Love thy enemy.' One Israel-Moses- Buddha-Jesus-Mohammed. - One! All one!" - All one! "Dilute! Dilute! Okay!" How about the switchboard? The hospital switchboard. Or all of these houses and apartments around here. They've all got to have phones. Esther... he's gone. Erik's gone. Oh, look at this. Read this. "For on God's spaceship, Earth"... "With bomb and gun, we're all one or none. All one, all one, all one! Exceptions eternally? Absolutely none!" "Absolutely none." Oh, my God. Why is the most inspiring thing that I've ever read sitting on a soap bottle? "Dilute." "Dilute! Dilute!" "Dilute! Okay." - You don't know that. - It's just the way it is. Because he could be with any of his friends. That's just it, honey. You don't know it for sure. You don't... No! No! Oh, oop! No... Oh, God, no. Shh... Okay, people. We're closing down shop in two minutes. You've got two minutes to get your purchases up to the counter. Okay? That's it, man. We gotta go. Come on. 250. Let's go. - Come on. - Yeah. Um... fuck. - Hey. We're done, man. - Let's go. I-I gave all my money to... here, just run this. Yeah, okay, buddy. That's it. We're outta here. You're closing up shop. Just... just... you're not selling any more of these anyway, right? Don't be stupid, man. We ain't giving them away, either. I understand that. Just take this. Here. That's all I got. It's all I got. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out now. - Hey. - Hey! Put down the kit! It's the end of the world, okay? Just let me walk out of here with a chance. Put down the kit. What? The last thing you wanna do on earth is shoot me? This is how this shit started, anyway. Right? That's how it started in the first... - You ready? - I'm fine. Good. If you're fine, the tests are gonna show it. Anyway... we haven't seen Dr. Henderson for a long time. - Come here. - That's right. And here I was, trying to cheer you up. Oh, yeah. You remember when we lived in Washington, the Georgetown apartment? Yes, I do. We both got the flu at the same time. Yeah. And I took care of you first. I ran out in the freezing cold, went and got you a nice, big bowl of hot soup. - It was so cold. - Yeah. And I wrapped you up all nice and cozy in a blanket. Remember? Then I turned the thermostat up as high as it would go. Then it was my turn to baby you. Tucked you in real tight, And I made you some of those awful poached eggs you like. Mm-hmm. It's been a good life. Yeah, I think so. A good life. Oh, I forgot to tell you. What? The best thing in the world. I have something to tell you. What...? The best thing in the world. We're going to have a baby. We don't have to do this. Whatever we said last night, we don't have to do it. Not today, anyway. Mmm, mmm. I regret every fucking diet I ever went on. Mmm. Come on. Let's get out of here. Ahem. If you have to, if that's what you have to do... go, but I won't. I... I don't think we're gonna run out of food. I don't think we're gonna run out of water. I think that if we just stay down here another couple of days... - No. - If we go up then, we're gonna be fine. - Mm-mm. - Okay? - No. - Yeah. Yes! Yes. Mia! Don't leave me! Don't leave me. Stay with me. I love you, baby, I love you. I need you. I need you, I need you. I need you, I need you... stay! Please stay! Please, I need you. Please?
