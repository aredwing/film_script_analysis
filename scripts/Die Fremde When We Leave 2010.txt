Melek will get better, God willing. I'm sure she was happy to see you. We didn't go to Aunt Melek's. Be quiet and eat. We waited really long for Mommy. I told you to eat! Open your mouth. Are you deaf? Stop it, Kemal! Eat your food! Come back here! Come back here! Don't, Kemal! What are you doing? Leave him alone! Get out of my way! Don't hurt him! Get in there! Zeynep, come on! We're late. Umay! My child... Mom! Why didn't you tell us you were coming? Cem! Look how tall you've grown! - Hello! Hello, my darling! You're so big. Come in! Come! Where's Kemal? So what do we do now? I missed you so much. It's so nice to have you here. Father! Welcome. Let me take that. Let me kiss your hand, Father. Umay! What a surprise! Cem, come here. Hurry up! Where's Kemal? In Istanbul. Have a seat. Come. If you'd let us know, we would have picked you up. You're so much bigger than you were in the pictures. Show me your hands. My Lord! Look at that... They're so big. When's Kemal coming? In a few days, for sure. He's got a lot of work. Are you ticklish? Catch me, Grandpa! - You bet I'll catch you. Stop that! Your father has high blood pressure. He shouldn't get too excited. How's the cafe doing? Good. Kemal fixed it up. Why don't you open another one? You could even open one here. That would be nice. He's not coming. He's not coming? What's that supposed to mean? Umay! What are you doing here? Sit down. Sit down! What took you so long? I was doing stuff. When did you get here? She's not staying long. Mind your own business. Did you say something? You heard me. What did you say? Are you deaf or something? - What did you say? Are you deaf? Sit down! Finish your meal! He didn't meant it like that. It's exactly what he meant. Mehmet says you'll make Cem a bastard if you take him away from Kemal. You've grown up. He looks like you. I was a lot fatter. She was homesick... I know... I know... But you know how young women can be. It's only for a few days. She's very sad. She doesn't want to upset you. Please, tell Kemal. Alright. God bless you. Where's Cem? Don't get upset, my child. Your father took him to Friday prayers. Why didn't you wake me? I wanted to let you sleep in. Eat something, my child. You're so skinny. Remember, how you fought your brother for this seat? Now you're back in your favorite chair. If only you talked to Kemal... We just don't get along. It will never work. Things aren't always exactly how we'd like them to be, my child. No matter what, you cannot separate your son from his father. I'm miserable, Mom. Is that what you want? I can't do it anymore. I'm exhausted. You told me you'd be here for me, no matter what. Let's make a ball. Going out? Yes, Mother. I'll be back at five. I've got to go. I'll be back in three hours. You can't do that. - Wait for me. Hey, wait! No! Holy Shit! I don't believe it! Do you wish you'd have kept the baby? He'll never change. I missed you. I missed you, too. A lot. Is this how a man behaves? I'm sorry. We were in the park. I lost track of time. Act like a man! Understood? - Yes. A real man acts like one! Yes. So? What? You're in love! He's got such beautiful hands. Beautiful hands? Look. We're getting married. You're too young, Rana. Look at me. Please... Leave me alone. I know what I'm doing. I love him, Umay. Will you be with me at my wedding? Of course. It's been a week. What are you going to do? Have you made a decision? I'm staying here. Find work, go to school. It's not just about you, you know. You have a son. And what about us? Everyone's talking about us. You want too much. Better than too little. You're a twenty-five year old mother. You're too old! Stop dreaming! I gave up a lot for you kids too. Do you want me to end up like you? Forgive me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. If you worked here, where would your child stay? It's taken care of. Really? Yes, my family will help me. Ok. You've got the job. Thank you. Do you watch this at home, too? I am home, Father. Umay, my child, we love you. You're our oldest daughter. But you belong to Kemal. You are a married woman. He beats me. He's your husband. The hand that strikes is also the hand that soothes. A slap or two is no reason to run. I'm not going back. I'm going to live here. How do you intend to do that? You are not alone. Did we raise you to bring shame upon us? You will return to Kemal. You always praised Uncle Bekir for choosing his own path in life. I still do. But you don't compare to him. Why not? Father, why not? Because that's the way it is! What are you doing? Have you gone mad? Get a hold of yourself! I'm not going anywhere! - Then do as you please! What are you going to do? What will you tell Kemal? He should come and get her. She is his wife. I wish she'd been born a boy! Was that good? Kemal, I didn't say you were wrong. Calm down. What? I understand. May God be with you. Whore! Kemal's not coming. He doesn't want you back. He called you a German whore. Do you realize what you've done to us? How are we supposed to look people in the eye? We have to take Cem back. He wants his son. Cem is staying here. You heard me. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Answer my father! Stay out of this. Look at him! - Silence! Are you alright? Get up. Leave me alone! He's his son! He has a right to him. You leave him no choice. It's best for Cem. Cem isn't going anywhere. He belongs with me. Umay, you're losing it. Get a hold of yourself! Get out of my way! Put down the knife! Let me pass! Over my dead body! You stupid girl! May God protect you from the evil eye. How did Kemal meet him? They became friends back in the army. Kemal trusts him. I don't trust anyone anymore. Don't worry, father. It'll work out fine. I'll leave with Cem tomorrow morning. It'll be alright. What's going on? Good evening. Is Umay Aslan here? What do you want from her? - May we come in? We received an emergency call. - Not from us. Please stay. Are you Umay Aslan? - Yes. Do you even have a warrant? We don't need one. Calm down. What is going on? What do you want from us? What is this all about? May God curse your soul! You shouldn't have done this, Umay! Beat it! You too! I'll be next door. Knock if you need me. Thank you. Good night, Cem. Good night. Good night. Thank you. - You're welcome. Father? Leave me alone. Go away. Sign here please. And here. Okay. I'll take care of the rest. - Thank you. That's what we're here for. Any more questions? Avoid all contact with your family, for now. And no meetings within the secure area, ok? Yes. You can play with the other kids here. Isn't that great? No. Where are you going? To work. Why? So you and I will have some money. Can't you stay here? Come here. I have an idea. You're a very strong boy now. Don't be afraid of anything, ok? I'm always with you! Thank you. You're welcome. That's it. Relax your grip, nice and easy... That's not bad at all. Nice and easy... That's it. A quick flip, front to back. Right? Good! Atife took longer than that. Nothing I do is ever good enough for her! Yes, it is. But give her an inch and she takes a mile. Now back to work! So, what's the answer? Acar! You coming or not? I'll catch up with you. Could you give this to mom? Please. Come back. I'll help you. What are you doing here? - Nothing. I just... Get out of my way. What is this? - Nothing. Where did you get this? She gave it to me. - Where is she? She just stood there. - What do you mean? You won't see her again, you hear me? I can see her if I want to! No, you can't. Acar, where is she? I have no idea. She didn't say. I don't know, man! Am I doing something wrong? No, you're doing everything right. Hi. My name is Stipe. Umay. Umay. Nice name. See you later. Sit down. They've broken off the engagement. All because of Umay, right? She's ruining my life! I'm not like her. I love Duran. My child, calm down. Duran's father will change his mind. Wait and see. There's no hurry. You're both still young. Mother, you don't understand. I can't wait! Mother, I'm pregnant. We're ruined. I invited Nimet over last week. She said they'd be out of town. But they went to someone else's place. She lied to me. What is she doing right now? Who knows where they sleep, or what they eat. The poor child is all alone. Without a family, without a father. She has ruined everything. Everything. The family, Cem, our honor, me. Why can't she at least live with us? She causes us nothing but pain. Kader, you must do something about Duran and Rana. Speak with his father. Convince him. Please. They must get married! Mommy... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Mommy? Yes? Are you going away? No, I'll never leave you. You left Daddy because he was angry with me. No. We didn't leave because of you. Your father loves you just the way you are. Is he coming to see us? Shall we walk for a bit? Are you well? I'm fine. Rana's wedding is off. Duran's father doesn't know that they have to get married. Come home! For your sister's sake. He says our family is without honor. It's too late for that now. I would only bring more shame upon you. But Cem needs you. And I would like to see you, too. Then do something about it! I don't know what. Umay, please! I don't want to! It's enough! You can't treat us this way. If so we'll never see each other again. Mom! Mom! Ok? Ok. Hi, Mete. How are you? Who's that? Acar. His sister was the one who called the cops. That slut Haldun was talking about? What did your friend just say? Nothing, just talking about chicks. What's the problem, boy? You got a problem or something? - No. - Sure! What are you going to do now? You should at least try to call again. Hey man, hang on. Come here. What? Are you sure? It's up there. Hey, what's up? Are you coming or not? - Leave me alone. I'm gonna throw up. - Not in my car! I'm not coming. - Why not? Afraid, or what? I'm not afraid. Why should I be? - I don't know. Are you afraid? - I'm not afraid! I'm talking to you! Are you afraid? Get out of there! Come down! A house full of women! Like I said, she's a whore! Shut the hell up! Let's get out of here! I know you're in there! Stop. That's enough! Go to hell! Mommy? Brother, stop! Please stop! Don't worry, my love. I'm here with you. Brother, stop it! Please! Take him, please. Is this supposed to prove you're a man? You don't scare me! You whore! Get lost! Get away from the window! Who is it? I don't know. Mommy? Yes? Why did you leave your T-shirt at Carmen's? When you leave, it's important to leave something behind. I'm sorry to put you through this. Don't be. I'm not afraid. You need to press charges against Mehmet. Don't you get it? It's my family. Can't you understand that? You have your own family. That's your child over there. Come here. Hey... You can stay here for a while, really. Thank you. One, two... and three! One, two, three! I got it! It crashed right into my butt, didn't it? Was that you, by any chance? - No. Excuse me. - Excuse me. Would you like to have dinner with me? I'd love to. I'm so sorry. I totally forgot. No problem. I'm still here. Yes. Are you still hungry? And what do they want for you? Nice things. The kind of life you aspire to when you live in Oldenburg, where everybody's always happy. And you? What do you want? Let's see what happens. You want to tell me about your brothers? For the Sugar Festival, Mehmet always made sure that I looked pretty. He'd comb my hair, carefully, very gently. He used to give me all his candy. Are you tired? What was it you wanted to show me? This. This moment. Let go of me! - You're ruining everything! I only want to see her for a moment. I want Cem to be at his aunt's wedding. If you want to make Rana happy just leave! It's enough. It's my family too. Who are you to give me orders! Did it ever occur to you that she might not want you here? Did you forget who raised you? Who changed your shitty diapers? Who dried your tears when you sobbed? Let me in, you asshole! Why can't we see Rana? Come on. I have a son. His name is Cem. He's a good boy. But, because he's my son, he's not wanted here. As a woman I decided to live alone. I have tainted your honor. I have destroyed my family's dignity. And now my son is without a family, too. Baba, you used to say blood is thicker than water. That we are only strong together. Father! Don't desert us...please! I never want to see you again. Never. Do you want to draw something? No. Are you hungry? No. Do you want to play a game? No. I want to see my grandma. So what are you going to do about it? I'm not leaving again. Well, what do you think is gonna happen? This is about something else, Umay, you know that. Maybe your parents will forgive you. But if they have to decide, if they have to choose between you and the community, they'll never choose you. Yes they will. Some day. Thank you very much. I thank you for hearing me. I would like to inform you of your daughter's condition. She's not well. Gul... Gul Hanim was your name? We appreciate your concern, and thank you for your efforts. But you see, Umay does not want any contact with us. Kader, that is not true. You know that. Umay misses you. Very much, in fact. But she fears you. We are her family. She has no reason to be afraid. Look. You are the head of the family. Your sons listen to you. You are their role model. You should care for all your children. Also your son. You don't want to lose him too, do you? Gul Hanim, please! I beg of you! Please. Good evening. - May God protect you. You leave God out of it. He has nothing to do with this. This is the kitchen. Nice. This is Cem's room. Aren't you hungry? No? I'll show you something. Mom? Mom, is that you? Mom, say something, please. Mom... Here comes another one! Oh, sorry. Bullseye! Happy Ramadan, Father. I brought you baklava. Father, I wanted... Because of Rana's wedding... Please forgive me. You're my family. You are my failure as a father, Umay. You're breaking my heart. Who was it? The neighbors' kids. They wanted sweets. What are you doing? Get out, Cem! Wait! He's my son! What kind of mother kidnaps her own son? What kind of father are you? - What did I do wrong? Get out, Cem. - Don't drive us apart! Don't ruin our lives! Stop it, Kemal. That's enough! Let him go. That's no way to do this! That's enough! I'll get him! How would your parents feel about you getting married again? Would they give you some peace? It wouldn't change a thing. Once a whore, always a whore. But thank you for asking. I'm leaving. Cem is all I have. What if I came with you? And the fairy said to him: You see? I told you. You're flying! She holds him tight and her wings carry him. And no one can see them except for him and the fairy. Why do we have to leave? Sometimes you have to leave people so you can find them again. Like Omer? Will we find him again? We always find the ones we love anew. But when we go, we have to leave something behind. We do. I never meant to hurt you. I'll finish school soon, go to university. I've met someone I love. Perhaps we will marry. You can be proud of me. I love you. Forgive me. Forgive me, my child. Go now. Go. Let's go, Cem. Mommy? Is grandpa sick? Yes. Grandpa is sick. Can I walk with you for a bit? Of course. He'll get better. Yes.
