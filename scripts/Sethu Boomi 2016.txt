In all the home town people of that place live. Only in Chennai people from all the places live. He is the hero of our film. Hia name is Kumaran. Lord Ganapati! Take me towards my victory. He is smart and good looking. Did you think that he is Chennai boy? It is not that. He is a real villager. Near Ramanathapuram Muthugalathur is his hometown. Do you know where he is going happily? His dream of eight years is going to come true. For your father to sit in this seat it took 38 years. That is why I sat quickly, uncle. You are talking in the same manner as your father. My words will come true. You'll flourish. Thanks, uncle. - May i come in? Yes. - Hey, Riyaz! Congrats! - Thanks. Congratulation, Kumaran. Thank you. - Sit. Yes. You are the first person to go to China from our company in promotion. It should be given by grandpa. Sentimentally I'm giving you. Within 20 days you'll have to leave. Thanks. All the best. You rock. - Thanks. Brother, one minute. Sister told me to wish you. Thanks. You achieved your wish. It is written that you will flourish. Who can change that? You rock. God is on your side. Congrats! - You! Watermelon! When are you going to marry me? Do you see lots of dream? It is not a dream. It is confirmed. I'm approaching you from 6 months time. There are so many chasing me like crazy. But you are not ready to even see me. What do I lack? How can I say that? On seeing a girl the feel to live with her for 100 years I should die on her lap, that feeling should come. On seeing me what do you feel? I feel so many things. Don't get angry. The way i said no to you tomorrow a girl might say no to me. For that can we get angry? Go lady. I curse you from my heart. You should go to China and charm a useless. What she talks you shouldn't understand.. and what you talk she shouldn't understand. You are sure to wander in China bus stand. Even if I wander like that I promise that I'll not chase you. Leave me. I'm going to China. Ramanathapuram district, Muthugalathur. I understand. It is not a bad place as you are thinking. A place filled with love. This story is about the people in this place. He is Rasu. Are you wondering that prayer song and black brief is coming together? There is no aim. Only desire is he should roam around alone in the middle of ten people. That is all. He likes his mother a lot. He is too crazy about money. If mother and son start talking about making money, they won't stop at all. Even if the town is in fire, that will think about only filling their cash register. Brother. - What is it, sir? I want to meet Sivagangai astrologer Manickyam. It is an important matter. Let us go and meet. Is it so? I'll get him now itself. - Don't forget. I'll get him now itself. He is Samy. He is everything to Rasu. Go and say that Samy has entered the game. Not only if someone talks wrongly about Rasu. Even if someone thinks, he'll hit. Now he is whipping. In future the ones he'll whip is all for Rasu. If any of you think about doing anything against Rasu, this Samy is still alive. Not even a single person can remain alive. Lord Ganapati! Look at this. The one born for war is fearing blood. bravery is not in seeing slaughtering of chicken. There is a value for blood. Can anyone talk to you? Hey, Kokri! Add lots of onion. Kakkai, you cook mutton for your brother-in-law. Greetings. - Greetings, Welcome. Abib! We are very happy. Won't they ask me? Uncle, brother has give one lakh. If you want you can give 1 1/2 lakhs. Will we refuse to take it? Okay, in my share you can write 1 1/2 lakhs. Not only that. In stone carving the main thing that you should watch is Kelachery Abib Mohammad. It should be written like that. Are you giving money only for fame? Not for fame. How long will we remain alive? When the next generation sees that, they should know that Hindus and Muslims have remained with unity. - Right. Who said that we are different? Akbar drank milk from a Hindu mother. Muthuranga Thevar, whom we pray as god has drunk milk from a Muslim mother. All the blood is one. Don't feel bad. I said it unknowingly. If the thoughts are good, we don't mind about religion. I'll leave. Thanks a lot. - Okay. Go slowly. Greetings. - Greetings. Will you borrow greeting also? I know. You go. Bring it inside. - You go. Will I kill it? On taking inside, I won't get anything. I must take the chicken in control here itself. Inside- - Hey! There are olden pants inside the brief case. Everybody seems to know fully about me. Brother-in-law! - Come. Kids! - Don't call as Chakkara Machan. I have a good name as Chakkara Murthy. Why do you call me as Chakkara Machan? In town everybody looks at me as if I'm a diabetic patient. Will anyone include Murthy and call? Go man. I think from Pavada you have got promotion to blouse. You go and ask your sister. - Hey, Valli! Brother! - Sister, how are you? You have become very slim. Don't you eat at all? Where is mother? - In kitchen. She is very angry. You go. - Okay. Mother. - Go away. Mother, why are you angry? I told you that I don't like you going to Chennai. In this you are saying that you'll be going to foreign. Mother, it is my wish from childhood. Please try to understand. At young age I thought you are saying for fun. Now you are really serious about it. Do you know how sad I feel? Go and see in the outside world. If children are going to foreign, they feel happy. Only in our house Do you know I'm in which position? How much is my salary there? Go mother. Is it a money that I have not seen in my parent's house? Or else it is money which your father has not earned? We are feeding some 6 to 7 families. Do you need to earn to support this family? Please mother. It is my wish. Try to understand. Don't talk about it again and again. - Mother! Your father is pampering you. - Mother! Why is the pot and vessel rolling? That's not the kettle. It's my throat. I think today my party is cut. Son-in-law, such a big fight is taking place at home. Without paying attention you are stitching hook in blouse. I... The more we reduce talking, the more food we'll get. You'll never lack for gruel. Kumaran is coming. - Come in. How are you? - Grandpa! Father. - What? Mother is saying that I shouldn't go to China. Just now you have come. You have bath and be ready. I'll handle mother. My pet father. - Go man. You must stay back and eat. That is why your sister has cooked chicken. So today also you won't leave. - When have I left? Come here. I want to talk an important matter to you. brother has come from out of station. They will be cooking mutton and chicken. you don't come away empty handed. You fill the tiffin carrier and bring. Are you not ashamed? - Don't make noise. What is it? He is a young boy. He is acting adamant. Why don't you go and tell him to have food? Have I delivered some 5 to 6 children? He is my only son. i wish that he should stay with me. He is not a small boy. He is old enough to take his own decision. But he'll listen to you, isn't it? He'll listen to me. Tomorrow when we are not alive he might start to feel that his life got spoilt due to us. After that there won't be any meaning for our affection. Eat. - No need. I'm telling you to eat. - No need, mother. If you say okay to my going to foreign, I'll eat. Okay, you go. Okay? My dear mother. Malar, are you still not ready? Father, I'm ready. It looks like seeing my mother Sembagavalli. Enough of wooing me. All those who came may leave from gate. Call them inside. - She is teasing me. Welcome, Kinsman. - Greetings. We got delayed. Why so much commotion for a marriage that won't take place? Go away. - Come. Come carefully. Have tea. One minute. Elders must not misunderstand me. Till now I don't know who is the groom in this. Whether he is fair or dark? Whether he has got money or not? Whether he is educated or not? He is old or young? However he might be, I have no problem. But... The man whom I marry must be resident groom. This also gone. If it is okay, not only tea. You will be provided lunch also. What, Malar? Dad, I am listening to you. Dad, please! Only for me. You have got many relatives. But for me, everything. is my dad only. Hey! Hey! Get up. Get up first. This also got failed. Directly, she will have 60th wedding then. Dad, are you angry? Why are you doing like this? "One who remain unfaithful and forget the help done by someone else, he will reach the hell and won't go to heaven". You only taught to me. There are two locks. I don't know which one. There is one more watchman here. Hey! Hello! Get up. Morning itself, you have a peg. Then you come here to sleep instead your house. This is your usual attitude. Already, the business is too bad. In the midst of that, he has come. Is he a Bombay tailor? Is he going to stitch jacket for Amala Paul and Nayanthara? What a fellow! He is just stitching dresses for ladies here. For that, he is showing off. Apply palm oil on your hair for 50 paise. You look terrifying. Hey, order tea for me. What a fellow! Why should I get tea for you? You order tea for yourself. There is no hair for you. You are having tummy freely. - Get lost. Hey, poison seller! You supply coffee using tamarind powder. Get one for me. Are you insulting my shop? In your tea, I will supply palm oil instead decoction. Remember that. Only murderers remain in this house. Wait. Let the road roller comes. I will make it roll over your head. Supply tea for him. - He has come freely. That's why, he is supporting me. Hey, see. My son has come. Hey, Bombay guy! Hey, tea fellow! - Hi! Master came. Today, I will have a peg. Then I will come and bite your scissors. I will vomit in front of your shop. Get down. Don't sit behind me. - Why? Why are you saying like this? - I say not to touch me. Hey! Whatever you want to tell me, say it in next street. Even if you slap, I won't mind. But don't insult me here. - Get in. Hey! If you are proper, keep the shop open till I come after having a peg. Hey, rascal! Stop there. Hey! Fool! Hey, you are running as if you got scared of your wife. So sad of your wife. What to do now? - Why is he running like this? He is not running just like that. He is running out of fear by looking at her. These two guys have come. They got stuck. - Careful. Don't stop in front of her. - Stop! What? - There is a problem for my wife. Please come and help me. Go and file a complaint in police station. Start the vehicle. - Sir, please! Please come and help me. - This girl needs help now. Come. Hello! Don't expect that he will have a fight if there is any problem. No need of all that. Please come. What's the problem? - It's over there. Come. Let it be. We are coming to solve the issue. Will you get us a peg? I will get you full peg, snacks and water packet. Wow! She is having a bar in wine shop. She is talking seriously. Are you joking? Come. Whatever she says, is it serious? Hey, Malar! Come here. By looking at a girl, I should feel that I must be with her for 100 years. Then, I should die upon her lap. That should be the feeling. The moment when I see that girl, she will be my wife. What are you looking at? Pick up the snake. No. Don't do. You phone for No. 108. If snake bites him, the van will arrive at the right time. I can't carry him. You phone. Did you talk so soon? I have given missed call. Will you give missed call to 108? What nonsense? One minute. - What? Will you hold slightly on top? Sir. - What? Careful. Okay. Rascal! Last time, a thorn has poked me. When I told you to take it out, you said 'Get out'. Now, you are throwing away the green snake from her hand. Hey, it's not the snake. It's the green rope. Green rope? You fool! It's a rope of trap. There is no one who got escaped from love. Hey, you got it. I will come. Hello! We have saved you from this Anaconda. But you are going just like that. Is just the word 'thanks' enough'? Or, shall we get her number? She looks like a spark. My son! I saw a guy who played Paandi. I saw a guy who played indoor games. But now only I am seeing a guy who is catching the green snake. Yes. - Not only that. Now only I saw a guy who massaged a snake like this. Oh! Hold this. For what? - Find all the details about her. What did you address me now? I addressed you as Uncle. - Then why should I do broker job? Hey, won't you find a bride for me? In your childhood, you used to stammer. The moment when you spoke well, I worshipped Lord in Pazhani. Will you tell me to investigate about girls in this manner? Get all the details before evening. Rascal! When did you drop me properly? Where is that snake girl? Hi, Granny! What? You are looking happily. - I caught a green snake. You fool! Did you catch a snake in forest? You only told me that if I massage a snake, the cooking will be good. You fool! After your wedding, your hubby should catch a snake and you should massage the tail. Then only, the food will be tastier. What are you saying? Why are you scolding me? Like how you said, I caught a snake. That has encircled my hand. The what? A guy who went by that side helped me to take away the snake. I massaged its tail. Won't the food be tastier then? Leave about the cooking style. How was that guy? Granny! Are you talking like a granny? It looks as if you have the desire upon him in heart and anger in lips. Granny, I will kill you. You might have seen only one in road at your age. But in my age. I have seen many like you. Go away. "Why did you take birth? Why did you take birth?" "A child is a child". "That's what many people think". "Why did you come here to disturb me?" What is this? Does he feel better? - First and all, he sleeps earlier. Today even after eating too parottas, he didn't sleep still. He doesn't think about his father. Won't you sleep? Give. Give. Have it. - Drink. No need? Go to Uncle's house and watch 'Chota Bheem'. You have understood the feelings of your Dad. "Worship during night time". - What is it? Wait. Wait. - "There are too many secret dreams". Wait. - What are you doing? - "Everything there is worship". Where are you searching for the phone? - See. Someone has asked me if I need bank loan. He is stopping us from doing our deed. You are lying down here after having a free peg. That guy is knocking the door. Go. Thinking that it is next house door, they are knocking our door. Hey, go and open the door properly. Wait, I will come. Listen. Don't sleep. Go. - About turn. Swear upon your parents. Promise me that you won't sleep. Will you go or not? Or I will get up. We both do all those jobs. Don't sleep. Go. - Anyway, you disturbed my sleep. I feel so excited. Who is knocking the door? Will you knock it till the dawn? Come. Come. Why are you knocking the door now? Okay. I think you were getting promise from Aunty. Did you hear? I might get promise. I will even eat food. Who are you to question? Get lost. Hey, you got 500Rs from me. If you buy snacks and jasmine flower with it, who will give me details then? Is this the time to ask for details? She is the only daughter of her beautiful parents. Okay? Go. - Hey! What sound it is? Your Aunty only. She slept. That's why, won't you sleep without boozing? Why are you crying? You fool! I have only one son. I thought of having 2nd son for his company, Why did you disturb me then? You are knocking the door at wrong times. You educated guy! Even if I beat the drum, she won't get up. I lost my life. I lost my happiness. You are crying a lot. You won't booze also then. Okay, leave it. I will go then. - Come here. - What? You asked me her details. My wife is one useless. She slept even in her Mom's wedding. If I want to say about my daughter-in-law, we need to see her for one day. We need to feed her on another day. Oh no. - That's her nature. Hey, you are boozing from last night. Starting from quarter, it goes till full bottle. Everyone has started going for job also. When are you going to say then? What to say? Actually... While boozing, do you know why guys close their eyes? He is torturing me. While drinking water, he thank the sky by looking above. While eating food, he thank the earth. While boozing, one closes his eyes. It's because, you are going to die by closing your eyes. That's the symbol. Hey, I told you to tell about my girl. But you are saying something and all. Why do you look angry? Shall I say? Shall I tell it as poetry? Twenty kilos in sky. Forty kilos of clouds. Fifteen kilos in rainbow. - See. Ten cents of stars. - Oh! Seven tonnes in lightning. All these were mixed thoroughly. In that 47 kilos, if Lord Brahma creates a girl in earth, how will it be? "Why are you killing me? Why are you plucking my heart?" "You look too innocent; but you are throwing stone into my heart". "My heart, like a puppy, it will move its tail, did you see?" "Did you tie my shaking heart?" "Why are you killing me? Why are you plucking my heart?" "You look too innocent; but you are throwing stone into my heart". Hail to our brother! Hail to our Prince! Hail to our brother! Hail to our Prince! "My love is a peepal; my heart is a plantain tree;" "My heart is filled with lovely birds". "Why are you thinking a lot? Why are you kidding me?" "Why are you shutting your door of heart?" "All the time, I am hearing your love music;" "Even if I lie down, I keep thinking of you". "After I started desiring you; I even love your family". "Don't disturb me as sweet breeze". "Why are you killing me?" "Why are you plucking my heart?" "You look too innocent". "But you are throwing stone into my heart". "In front of your house, you kept the spices for drying". "Even my love age is getting dried along with it". "You made me speak to the breeze; you made me sing by myself". "You made me a cock on your memory". "I don't feel like talking to my people;" "I remain reserved with myself without mingling". "I am living only in your memory;" "But you are going without telling me anything". "Why don't you unite with me as river?" "Why are you killing me?" "Why are you plucking my heart?" "You look too innocent". "But you are throwing stone into my heart". O my flower! You look like fire spark. - Hey! Whom are you addressing as flower? Your father remain responsible. But you are going behind a girl. Hey! Crab! - Did I say as frog then? Son! My girl and your girl are there. What are you saying? - Turn the vehicle first. What is this? - Wait. See there. Am I right? Using a stone, they are polluting the water? They caught a green snake in a forest on that day. Today, they are trying to catch something using a stick. Let them catch anything. You catch this. Stone! Hey, man! Don't throw it upon my head. They will get angry then. Hello, we are doing one important matter here. What are you doing here? What are you doing? Inside the water, are you preparing snacks? Hey, don't you have sense? Why did you throw the stone inside? Hello! Can't you see properly? Are you so sure that he only threw the stone? By throwing the stone, why are you terrifying the girls? Stupid! - While talking, why are you slapping me? I will get you a peg. Keep quiet. There were two stones. One got skipped. For that, she is scolding us. Stupid girl! Hey, come. Let's go. Look at them. Looking like idiots. - Call them. Hello! Hello! Girls! Girls! Frog catchers! What is this? I told you to call them. But they left. You are so lucky. What do you say? That girl is always catching something or the other. Bald fellow! Are you my Uncle? What did I say now? For leaving me, he is finding new reasons. Still 16 kilometers. Kumaran! Kumaran Sir! For 50 Rs, you are predicting the horoscope. Why don't you say something good? You are going to get caught to Vallaalan. Go. Go and suffer. - Where did I say? That Goddess is saying. I said them through my lips. Even while saying good, you might also have to face bad time. Whatever Goddess says, I am saying. That's it. Come, Brother. - Come, Rasu! You told me to come. Rascal! What did you say? Hey! When a girl comes to show horoscope, will you predict something bad? You are working for just meager amounts. If you behave like this, I have invested crores of cash in my business. How should I behave then? Rasu! - Are you cheating others? - Leave him. He is innocent. If you beat him, it's a disgrace to you. You carry on with your work. Rasu, since I am poor, you have beaten me. But whatever I told your granny, it won't go wrong. There are four palm trees. One of the four will surely fall down. By looking at that, you will cry a lot. On that day, if my words go wrong, I will chop my tongue and throw it in front of your house. Brother, he is saying something and all. Will it happen like that? Whether it will happen or not. You shouldn't misbehave with them. That's why, I told you to calm down. Is he a God? Uncle! Why don't you eat and go? I have eaten. When did he eat? Don't worry. He will come surely. "In the midnight worship". Get lost. What are you looking at? - Don't scream. Get down. - Why? "In the midnight worship". We have reached the border of her house. We will drag it and go after this. Is it Pakistan border or what? If his father chops us into pieces by seeing us? You only said that her dad is a teacher. Then how will he chop us into pieces? If he is a teacher, won't he chop us? Won't your love has eye, ear, nose or anything? Shall we do like this? - How? - One minute. In international level, we should think like this. By putting the hand inside the pocket? By tossing the coin, if head comes you alone go and see now. If the tail comes, we will see her tomorrow. Okay? You will have to go alone from here to your house. Is it okay? Me alone? - Then me? - There are three burial places. There are 9 guys who are incharge of it. There are 20 drum beaters also. Are you scared now? Then come. "In the midnight worship". Kumaran! - What? - People start the bike and drive. But you are switching it off and dragging. Is it right for you? If there is any problem, we can escape. What escape? At this time, even the devil will take rest. But you are using alarm for love. When she goes to school, When she goes to market, you love her. Don't irritate me for all that. - Hey! Whenever I want to see her, I will see. Look at me. If anyone comes, give me a silent signal. Okay? - How will I give a silent signal? Why are you shouting? Devil usually comes for walk during this time. What do you say? - That will come by wearing jasmine flower. Fool! You are having the jasmine flower. Yes. Yes. I don't understand what all I'm having. O devils! don't come. I am the only husband of my wife. In this village, every house has got axe if not stove. They might chop other fellows even in morning. No one will come as witness. If they chop me in night, my wife will become a widow then. If we bark like these dogs, we will be safe then. "If you don't know how to react, ask me". Oh no. If you watch serial till 1 am, who will come to watch night shows in theatre? Kumara, it's wrong. Hey! My son Kumaran! Don't take more time. Why are you shouting? I am coming. Why are you running like this? Did you tell her that I have also come? Get lost. Why didn't you tell me there is a dog in her house? - Dog? Instead of this churidhar shawl, why did you bring another shawl? I kept that shawl for drying. But today morning, it is missing. Oh! If guys get a small cloth, they will do black magic and trap girls. This is such a big dupatta. That's all. Hey, I am scared already. Why are you scaring me more? I said it just for fun. No. I feel something and all. Someone is following me. Son! After this dogbite, I am unable to sleep. Whomever I see, I feel like to bark at them. I don't know what's going to happen for us. Oh! It's so hot. In this shop, cool drinks taste will be good. You have them. I will come now. If one who has been bitten by a dog doesn't put rabies injection, he might die. You said you will get me drinks and snacks. First you drink these cool drinks. Then only, you can booze well. - Son! My son! For looking at them, should I drink cool drinks? Will no one come to put an end to this? If I drink cool drinks without brushing my teeth, I will get fever. Oh! Whoever is in love should get infected with Chickungunya. Excuse me! I want to talk to you. My name is Kumaran. - Hmm. I have studied MBA. My age is 25. - Oh! My father's name is Kasilingam Pandian. My mother's name is Naatchiar. - Okay. I am the only son of my parents. We have got lot of properties. Oh! - I will be shifted to China branch by Sameera group of companies. You can also accompany me. Why should I come? Company allows to take my wife also. They will give us apartment to stay. You tell this to your wife. That's why, I am telling you. Do you dream a lot? Dream can't be seen. It comes by itself. - What are you trying to say? Do you love me? I don't like all that. Even I don't like. But I liked you a lot. If you also like me, I will ask your hand along with my parents in proper way. Listen. In the name of love, I don't want to defame you. Whatever you think won't take place. Did I ask you whether it will happen or not? I just asked you whether you like me or not. Talk about something else. Okay. We will talk a lot after marriage. Alright? What, Son? Are you talking like how I said? Is it going fine? Get lost. Hey! Hey! Give the money for cool drinks. Hey! Hey! "You can also lie upon my shoulder". Enough of singing. Get up, my dear! I have prepared hot vada for you. Vada snack even for today also? What is this? Tomorrow I will take leave and prepare bajji snack for you. No. No. When you have leave, you prepare bajji snack for me. Okay? Oh! Cooker! Careful, Dad. "God will fail in this". Who is calling me at this time? Hello! - Hello! Malar! I am Kumaran speaking. Who is calling? That Kasi Devar's son. That day, I told you about taking away the snake. Oh, is that guy? He belongs to our next village. The line might have got crossed. What next village? Vehicles might get crossed. Will the line also cross? "God will fail in this". - Oh! "God will fail in this". Malar! Malar, the moment when I saw you I want to live for 100 years with you. I felt like I must die in your lap itself. Hey! Moustache fellow! In these 7 crores people, if we both live together, will there be any problem? Even after picking up the call, you need not say 'hello'. Please say 'I love you'. Why are you disturbing me? You kept the foreign liquor outside and Indian liquor inside. Then how will our country develop? Keep our liquor outside. Keep the liquor outside. Hey, no. - Hey, shut up. Hey, Sami! - Shut up, you bloody fellow! If you have pen in your hand, will you write anything? No... No... No... No... Hey! I did it by mistake. Hereafter I won't do. Please forgive me. Please give the finger. It has to be given immediately to join. Please give. Please! If you have paper and pen, will you write anything? I will beat and kill you. Please tell him. People always create issues every now and then. Hey, give it. Give it. - Take it. - Please give. I will take leave. Thanks! - Hey! Finger is for writing. But if you talk, Get lost. - Useless fellows! For this itself, he lost the finger. What is this? He chopped the finger. All are Samy's fellows only. Hey bald fellow! Did you see? I am the Samy. Sir, what do you want? Why are you blocking our way? Leave us. We have to go. You move. Let me talk to him. Before I get angry, you drop the sand and go. Or else? Only the cart and bullock will reach home. Why? Will you shoot us? Try and see. We will reach our home only with this sand. I will manage whatever happens. Rasu's guys carry sand in their lorries and tractors after 12 am. You people were safeguarding them. Since we are poor, are you taking us for granted? We are taking the sand for our low scale work. You are treating us as thieves. Right? You people won't listen to us properly. Only when we arrest and beat you, you will listen. Hey, stop it. Hey! Is shouting and beating your job? Won't you find a solution to the problem? Everyone knows that sand shouldn't be transported from riverside. I can't take lesson for each and every one. By wearing the khaki, don't joke. You are talking like this here. Don't you know about the thieves who steal sand at 12 am? They have got lot of money from them. That's why, they act so reluctant. This is my duty. No one should interfere in this. We also know that it's wrong to take sand from riverside. This is neither the river nor the sea. This is pond. In lorry and tractor, many bigshots are stealing sand. Leaving all of them, so sad of these farmers. Their agriculture got destroyed. They just pick two loads of sand. They sell them to construction companies. That's how, they are leading their lives. You are torturing them. So sad. Leave them. We will solve the issue. Hey, go away. Go away. If you decide everything, what is he doing here? What is the use of us then? There is station. There is law. There are many jobs for us. You please go. He has said anyway. Then what? Please go. Go. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, Pandi! Arrange them. Come. How are you? Is he not there? - He went to Sayankudy. What's the matter? His brother is there anyway. That Kadharbhai matter. One who transports sand via cart. When we caught them while transporting the sand, he talked against me that I was safeguarding for Rasu. Since I was angry, I would have hit him at that time itself. Since I don't want to drag Rasu, I left him as it is. That Kasalingam also supported them. Listening to them, they all went. Then, why do we remain as police? Now also, I came to inform your brother. For getting money from you, I can't get insulted from people. For this matter, you are standing here. If you had beaten them when they were talking? Break his hand by beating him. If he remain hungry for ten days, they will keep their mouth shut. If the elder comes to know? I will manage. You said it. I will squeeze him then. I told you to cut the ladies finger. But you are cutting it like woods. See how you are kidding. I will tell you something. Mom, cut it well. Kumara! If you go to Chennai, you will come only once in 6 months. Now you are going to China. When will you come? From China, it's only five hours. Whenever you want to see me, I'll come. Kumara, you will be working in China. Mom is scared whether you will marry a Chinese. Shut up. Mom, don't listen to what sister is saying. Your daughter-in-law lies 6 kms away from here. It looks as if you are not going to find her. It looks as if you have fixed a girl. Hey, man! Keep quiet. You don't put new hooks. Hey, Kumara! Where are you going? Won't you keep quiet? - I will come now, Mom. He doesn't know anything. After this problem, did police guy say anything? In the way you treated him, he is totally shattered. He won't interfere in our way. Don't be so assault. They are real rogues. They will do anything for money. Don't go alone. Okay? Dad, I will go out and come. You go and come. - Bye! He looks like a cub. Bye! Come to my village. I will deal with you. Kumara! Why are you fighting with those boys? They poured water in my liquor. Don't talk badly about them. - They should be killed. - Shut up. You at lease get one for me. There is non veg food in my house. Get me one. Please! Malar, only on Sunday I prepare porridge. Today also, penance? Hey, what did that astrologer say? There is danger for the important person in house. Who is there in my house? My Dad only. For him, not just one day. I will remain in penance for 10 days. Go and light that lamp properly. Hey, shall I meet that astrologer? He will change the water again into liquor. Why did you bring me here? Won't you come to temple? Listen. There is a case upon me.. that I sold an Undi from this temple in Singapore. Only 3 Rs was there in Undi. Thinking about this case, my lawyer committed suicide. Do you know? You should get reformed. For your sake, I came to pray to God. Don't utter a lie. You don't pick me up properly. You also don't drop me properly. To see that snake catcher girl, you brought me here. Don't announce it. - Carry on. One who has come with that girl, I should propose my love to her. He goes without listening to me. You will be beaten up. Hey, girl! I am coming. "Bended eyebrows and cherry like reddish lips". "the divine smile; The thick plats; in the coral like body". "holy ash is applied". "That divine feet of yours". Are you 'Thalapathy' Rajnikanth? What are you singing? I will kill you. I want to tell you something for a long time. Nowadays, I don't like to booze. If I lie down, I'm unable to sleep. For you, I'm double okay. For me, you are slightly okay. I love you. Answer immediately. I will poke you with a knife. Run away from here. Light the lamp and poke the knife also. I wonder where you are going to get married. Cha! - Wow! I am unable to worship properly in temple. Malar! Hey, Malar! Hey, new flower! Where are you taking the lamps? Hey, we have met each other many times. Why don't you say 'Hi'? Is there anything wrong? If I want to say 'Hi' to known people, I will have to say it all the time. Okay. Okay. Fine. You need not say 'Hi'. But at least, you can say 'I love you'. - Not only today. Even if you come behind me for another 50 years, that won't take place. Hey, Malar! Hey! I am sorry. I just tried to hold you. Sorry! She has broken coconut for him. Stop the bus. Let there be holiday for schools. What? What happened? Hey, Uncle! - What Uncle? Her slap sound was more louder than temple bell sound. I told you not to irritate her. Now she slapped you. She didn't slap. She just touched me. Did she touch you? You called a green snake as rope. Will you accept that she slapped you? I never thought you will be insulted like this. Sorry! Since the lamp kept for her Dad got broken, she slapped you. Don't hype it up and become angry. Please forgive her. It's okay. - Listen. If you don't ask sorry, we would have burnt her village wholly. Nonsense! You can go. Due to you only, even she is not loving me. You are not educated, Come, let's go. - Where? Sacramant is given. Come. I am already irritated. - Come to have sacramant. You don't get for me. Come on. Hey, what? You slapped him over there. Now, are you crying here? You are mad of your Dad. Even your father don't like what you do. Do you know whom you have slapped? He is a good guy. Why don't you ask sorry to him? INAUDIBLE Ah! When? Is he available? I will come at once. Dear! - Dad! Call brother. - I will call him now. I was unavailable for one another. They have created an issue. What? - Why should we come to all the places? If it goes like this, we will be... - Samy, till the issue is over, be calm. Get lost. - Will he listen to what we say so easily? Whatever it is, Rasu will speak. You don't speak. Okay? All the thieves are there. See. Rasu, don't play with innocent people. Kadharbhai should return back to his house before evening. Or else, you will be held responsible for all issues. This is our problem. Did we interfere in your problem? Why are you interfering in our matter unnecessarily? We will tackle this. You will manage all that. Where is Kadhar Bhai? Search for him in some mutton shop. Hey! Upon whom are you pointing the finger? I will cut it then. Cut it. Cut it. - Keep quiet. - Don't create an issue. Keep quiet. Rasu, before today evening, Kadharbhai should be in front of my house. Sorry! - Come, let's go. Come. You keep quiet. Hey, are they so powerful? Brother! - Tell me. - I will kill them. - Keep quiet. Keep quiet. You are talking about murder. You should survive first. Just calm down. Hey! Are you there just to kill them? We should criticize them first. They just got our money and did nothing else. Hello, what is he saying? Hey! I told you to leave that Kadharbhai. Let him be in my custody for one day. If we tell you to arrest, you must arrest. If we tell you to leave, you must leave. Anyway, you are getting money from us. Hey, come. Thanks, sir. - You have beaten him well. If you talk once again, I will chop your head. Go. Brother, elder is talking too much. Shall we finish him? Cha! Our mistakes should last for only 15 days remand. After killing that elder, should we remain in jail permanently? Whatever we earn, we should enjoy that. That's life. Malar, I heard you want to meet me. What's the matter? It's my mistake. I came to say sorry. I don't need your sorry and Hi. I need my love. Hey, don't talk about it again and again. I can't. Hey, what you can't? I like you a lot. Do you like me or not? Say that you like me or you don't like me. If you say that you don't like me, I will go like this. A good guy like you. A nice family. Am I a fool to say no to all these? Then, what's your problem? I don't have the privilege. The moment when I was born, I lost my mother. From that day onwards, my Dad brought me up. Leaving him, are you telling me to come to China? - Hey! All girls will have to live with their husband after marriage. Is your Dad a huge matter? - Stop it. What do you know about my Dad? When my Mom passed away, my Dad was 24 years old. For a guy, that's the age to start the life. But for my Dad, it has got over. Without thinking about another wedding, he survived only for my happiness. I can't come by leaving him. For everyone, their father is a teacher. But for me, he is my God. My family feeds this entire village. Won't we feed your father? Don't talk about it again and again. From the moment I saw you, I started forgetting my Dad. During his end stage, I should look after him as my son. He should die in my lap only. Hey, Malar! - Please! I beg you. Don't make me unfaithful. From the moment I saw you, I started forgetting my Dad. I beg you. Don't make me unfaithful. Hello! - Devadha! I am Kumaran. - Yes, tell me. I started. Nothing. Inform your friend. I will never disturb her life. Kumaran! Actually, Malar... - I didn't forget her. I am taking her memories with me. Please listen to what I say. Malar is a very good girl. I should take four passports like Kumaran. I will go for job in China and Japan. You did a lot here. You need not work over there. Hello! He says that he wants to earn a lot in foreign. Let him go. - Tell her. Over there, liquor shops will remain opened for 24 hours. That's why, he wants to go there. - Oh! What is this? When he is taking leave, you are crying. She will cry for everything. I will accompany you. - Dad! If you come, I will also cry along with you. I will manage. - Okay. - Take leave. Long live! Long live! Have timely food. - Don't cry. Be careful. What are you doing? What is your problem? Listen. You got a nice life. Don't spoil it. A girl might get anything like profession and money. But if she doesn't get a good husband, she has to cry for her whole life. Nice family. Nice guy. Why are you so adamant? Did I tell you that I am in love with him? You need not say. I know. Only your lips deny it. But your eyes say that you are loving him. What should I do to make you understand otherwise? - Wait. I will call his number. When he says 'hello', if you don't shed tears, I will accept that you are not in love. Do you need only that? Give it. Talk to him. Tell me, Devatha! Devatha! Malar! Malar! Is it you? Talk to me, Malar! Talk to me. Hey, what? Malar! Malar! Malar! What happened? Malar! Hello! Hello! Malar! What happened? Go and see what happened. Hello! Malar! Hello! Hello! - Won't you speak? Vimal! Vimal! What happened? Vimal! For asking them, they have beaten me. Hey, who sent you? Who? Who? Tell me properly. If you don't say, then... - Hello! Malar! Malar! Malar! Malar! Malar! Malar! Open your eyes. Malar! Malar! Malar! Malar! Malar... We should do something to them. If you keep walking like this? They might have done something. We should do something. If we remain calm, they might underestimate us. That Rasu might have done everything. Keep quiet. You are talking as if you have witnessed directly. Don't utter anyone's name simply. Are you safe? - I am safe, Dad. How about that girl? She is fine now. Malar! Dad! Will I leave you and go? Nothing will happen like that. God won't leave us. Is it paining very much? My dear! O God! Nothing should happen to my son. Kumara! - Mom! - What happened to you? Since I cried, did it happen like this? - No, Mom. What is this? What are you talking? Go and see the girl who saved our son. - Come. Kumara! Dear, what happened? They have beaten her like this. If I had known that you all will cry for me, I would have died at once. - Dear! Don't say like that. Till 100 years, you should lead a long life. Nothing will happen to you. How do you feel now? Please! Don't disturb the patient. Leave the place. What happened? How is she now? She is fine. Nothing will happen. - Okay. Then what, Kumara? There is no danger for anyone. Okay, you take leave. No, Dad. I am not going. What is this? That's your desire. Are you scared of all these? Don't worry. You take leave. Not that, Dad! - This not new to us. We are used to it. You just take leave. I am not going, Dad. Not that. Dad! - What? You take leave. I will take care of her. You go home and take rest. Brother! - Tell me. Tell Uncle and Ambani to come to tea shop. Who is coming in car? Oh! This guy? Do you know who I am? My Dad? He is Rasalingam Pandi's son. You know. This wound? Do you know how it took place? Attempt to murder. In front of me, you are the only one who pointed your finger against my Dad. Now I have only a small doubt. That's why, my vehicle has been parked just in front of you. If it gets confirmed, my vehicle will run over you. What? - Hey, Rasu! I don't know whether you are behind it or not. But if you desire to challenge my family, I will kill all of you from your family. Where is Samy? What is happening? Did you challenge Kasi's son? Or my relative? Kasi might have created a scene. He might have come to kill for that. Who will attack your relative girl? Then why should she go there? Ask like that. Only love will make a person to go anywhere. You will have to accept that. I sent moustache guy and Pandi. They will bring Samy now. Where is brother? Why do you feel angry? He will come now. This is it. Hey, he should be killed. Samy, how is Malar? There is nothing wrong for Malar. What is happening here? Even I am also thinking that. Whatever we did casually, someone is doing them with a plan. Why do you think about the past? Wait. Kasi's family has mistaken us. We should change that first. Let's think what to do. From the age of seven, he fed me. He has come to our place and threatened us. We should do something. Hey! What is it? Is Mahaut feeding the elephant or vice versa? You are one... Some one has chopped him. He has been admitted in hospital. You are the one who gave second life for him. Listen. You have time to do good for Rasu. First, try to save your relative girl and her life. It's you who has to do everything for her as her mother. I will deal with the rest. Listen to what I say. Brother! - I am telling you. I will manage Rasu. Hey! None should know what has happened here. Samy, you go first. What? How are you? - Are you fine? - Yes. I am fine. He is waiting there. He wouldn't have come with a good news. Come in. What's the matter? You are bigshots here. You are hiding the fight case as accident. That day, your son has also threatened Rasu. He is also hiding that. You are playing this game without informing the police. If there arise any problem, it will be a shame for us. As a police officer, I am there to help you. You are the elder of this town. You decide for yourself. Don't put me in trouble between the issue of you and Rasu. I came to inform you only this matter. As you think, nothing has happened. For the help, we will come to you only. Brother, do you want divine porridge? No need? It will taste well. Kadhar, reach home quickly. - Okay. Dad! - What? If anything has happened to me, who will look after you? Don't talk like that. Without getting drained out of my grandson's urine, I won't die. That's what, I pray to God. Will God leave me or what? Come. Come. Malar, see who has come? Malar! How are you? - Hmm. You keep talking. I will bring tea for you. You be here. Murugavalli, you bring tea for all. Okay, Mom. - Come in. You saved my son's life. What am I going to do for you? - This love is enough till the end. Take your seat. Do you wonder how to call me? Call me as mother-in-law. Brother, I am asking you as your sister. - Yes. For how long, will you remain as father to daughter and vice versa? Please send Malar as my daughter-in-law. Should you ask like this? I should be lucky enough. I will enquire her Mom's relative and let you know. You ask and tell me. But Malar should be my daughter-in-law. It's a torture to prepare curry. Hey, you marry. Why are you saying comedy at once? I am telling the fact. You marry. I can only have first night instead of wedding. I can do only that. - Hey! A girl should look after you in future. - Okay. Then who will look after you? - Are you so good or what? Get lost. Oh! Teacher is coming here. Ask him what it is. Kasi's family have asked Malar's hand for wedding. What did I do to you? You left the house at the age of 7. Your sister has given birth to a girl and passed away. Am I responsible for that? You lost your life like this. The moment when I married your sister, She told me that you are not my brother-in-law. She said that you are our son. From that time till date, I am seeing you as my son. How many times have I approached you to come back? Even now also, I can't be happy thinking about Malar's wedding. I am still crying by thinking about your condition. Only when you come, she will marry. For you, everything is your sister's daughter. Think and see. Hey, whom are you pointing? If you do so, I will cut your finger. If you think about attacking my family, I will kill your entire family. O God! You should look after us well. See. From sowing the seeds in Kumaran house, till the plants are harvested, they won't do anything without us. Hey! You don't keep your hand upon this. Then like last time, there might be destruction then. You always get ashamed like this. Give me strength during these tough times, God! Hey! - Give me strength, God! Rasu shouldn't know about our arrival. - Okay. Hey, see who is coming? Come in. - Come. How are you? I thought of talking to you But you have come. I came to inform you.. that there is no connection between Rasu and these incidents. I know. Whoever desire for family and money, won't attempt to kill anyone. What? I thought you will come as relative. But you have come as fighter. I know. You are like Karnan along with Duryodhana. Where there is anger, there will be character. Leave all that. Your sister's daughter. Are you ready to give her hand to my son? Tell that first. - He is an angry guy. How will he say yes then? Wait. - Tell me. When shall we fix the wedding? - See this. Like this only, we should fix the wedding. Muthuvaduga Thevar and Kamatchi Ammal's grandson. Kasilinga Pandian and Naatchiar's son Kumaran and Govinda Thevar and Paappathi Ammal's grand daughter, Muthaiah and Lakshmi Ammal's daughter, Puthiya Malar are going to get married which has been fixed in front of elders. "It's you or me; come and join". "Even the breeze got united; let's touch the border". "It's you or me; come and join". "Even the breeze got united; let's touch the border". "I can't bear the hunger; arrange for lunch". "When you look at me, I feel excited; come to me". "I could understand your feeling; bear for one month". "I will surrender myself wholly; take me wholly". "Is it right?" "It's you or me; come and join". "Even the breeze got united; let's touch the border". "Drop the jasmine flowers upon the bed". "Act as if those jasmine flowers get squeezed". "Due to my nonstop kiss, did you lose your ear rings?" "Search for it below the bed; with shyness after the dawn". "Hey, devil! Don't do it. This is too much". "Even your anklets are creating high sound and wakes up everyone". "If you sleep, I will also sleep; Else I won't be able to sleep". "My arrogance will be controlled in your sari fall". "Due to these kisses, this jasmine will shy away". "Due to the touch of your hand, I will get intoxicated". "Is it right?" "It's the time where lightening passes inside the head". "Like star rain drops, you should kiss me". "Intermittently, this cloud will shed rain out of desire". "When my wings become wet, I will shiver like sparrows". "Why should my youthfulness should get wasted? Give me more and more". "I can't tolerate your torture; you move and lie down". "Even the angels will come and decorate our bed". "Why did you become as Vethal? My body is paining a lot". "There are lines in your palm for 6-7 kids". "Oh my God! There will be problem in this country due to you". "Is it right?" "It's you or me; come and join". "Even the breeze got united; let's touch the border". "I could understand your feeling; bear for one month". "I will surrender myself wholly; take me wholly". "Is it right?" "It's you or me; come and join". "Even the breeze got united; let's touch the border". Okay. Come on. Did I make you wait for so long? It's okay. Tell me. - I... I should have come and met you in house. By conveying the matter of my jail sentence, I might cry. I am quiet scared of that. Last time, I cried for my sister only. I have never seen my mother. My sister is everything to me. Since she was born, my sister passed away. Thinking so, I ran away at the age of 7. When I came back, she looked like my sister. Every day, I thought of asking pardon to her. I feel bad that I left the mother and child. Hence till date, I am unable to face her. According to me, my sister's daughter is a Goddess. I can see her only from long distance. Uncle! Listen. A human life, is a distance from birth till death. In that small distance, one should know who is affectionate to whom. That's why, I brought her today. I will give you half of my life span. You will lead a long life. This Samy has not prayed to God before. Now I am asking you. The life which my sister didn't lead, her daughter should lead. She should live. You should make her live. Hey! You are too intoxicated. Go carefully. - Okay. Who is intoxicated? Is this the level of intoxication? You go, man! Samy!!! Samy!!! Samy!!! Oh my God! Take him from here. Move. Move. Samy!!! Oh, Uncle! - Samy!!! Samy!!! You passed away without seeing her wedding. You became a dead body like this.. Look at your sister's daughter. She got fainted. What will I say? Samy!!! Samy!!! I will kill the one who killed you. Elder! See, they killed him out of relationship. Even if I say many times, you won't listen. Now also, I am telling you. Kill that Kasi lingam Pandi. Within 8 days, I will bring you out by using my position. One who killed him should be ruined. Tell her to eat. Malar! Is it right if you remain hungry? Please eat a bit. Get up. Careful. Uncle! Please have lunch and go. I will eat. Don't cry, Malar. When I was born, my mother died. Now only I knew that my Uncle loves me a lot. But whenever I look at him, I remember my Mom. Now he also died. Did I commit such a big mistake? This is the only property which your Uncle kept for you. "Like my mother, I considered you in my heart". "Your name safeguarded me as a fence". "I saw the dowry of my Uncle inside this box". "Only tears are left for this girl". "Leaving you, your eyes won't go with tears". "Till I die, my debts on you won't get reduced". "Leaving you, your eyes won't go with tears". "Till I die, my debts on you won't get reduced". Malar! I will take leave. Hey, what happened? Why are you crying? What happened? I was born as a girl. Yes. If my Uncle die out of fever or accident, I will consider it as fate. But someone has beaten him dead. If I remain as guy, I would have done something. Hey, what is this? Don't cry. That Rasu is considering you as culprit in Samy's murder. Rasu might say like that. But people know about us. You are one. People might think wrongly also. Who is it? This is month end. They might have come for money. What is the matter? - I want to enquire about Samy's murder. Why should you enquire me? If police has a doubt, they will enquire at least four people. Leaving those four people, you have come here. Even if we have killed him, we will surrender at once. We don't kill the relatives. Don't be so excited. Shall we close the case by saying that Samy was not murdered? - Proceed. Even if you don't find, I will find. Not for you. But for my fiancee. Kumara! - Dad! Tell me, Dad! - No. If you had gone to foreign on that day, this problem wouldn't have arisen. Right? Nothing like that, Dad. No. Unnecessarily, we are forced to interfere in this. Dad, we have connection in this. What do you say? - Yes, Dad. That day, one who has beaten me. And the one who killed Samy, if they both are same? The day when Samy talked to me, he was killed during that night. Maybe, one who doesn't like this relation might have killed Samy. We need to find this, Dad. Son! Whatever it is, be careful. Be careful. - Okay. Samy is our guy. Whoever has killed him should be killed. Don't hype up this issue. Police is there to investigate. Then what? What will police do? They have covered the mirror with wire. Will they solve our issue or what? We should do something in this. For the love you have with my family, I am so glad. Listen. Samy is not only related to you. He is related to us also. Out of hastiness, don't do anything. Whatever it is, tell me. I will take leave. Uncle! - Ah! Come here. - Why are you not allowing me to concentrate in sports? Wait. I will put two goals and come. Nonsense! - Brother, he doesn't know anything. He is irritating us. Please take him. Hey, get lost. Move. What did you say? Get lost. Did you beat me? Wait. I will inform my wife before dealing with you. Get in, Man! - What reason? Before and all during your love period, you included me also. Now you got engaged. Then what is my need? You go, Man. - Hey! Many murders are taking place. Shouldn't we find who killed Samy? Listen. Police, CBI and CB-CID are there for that. If you interfere in this, you might get caught. Be careful. Will I? - Yes. - First, I was targeted. But I got escaped. Next, they killed Samy who became our relative. Next, I am close to you, since you are my Uncle. Next, it's your turn. Better know one thing. My wife knows how I should die. My wife only knows how she will die. You need not worry. You start now. - Listen. Don't come to me if there is any problem. Why are you doing like this? I am having a shop in wine shop. Will he kill me? Start the bike. Let's go to bathroom first. I feel uneasy. If I was killed, even that axe will cry. Senthil Brother! Senthil Brother! - No one is there. Is it you? Come in. What's the matter? Nothing. Samy has been killed. I came to enquire about that. He does gundaism; he follows violence. He has even tortured tea seller. Will he die peacefully? He will die like this only. Why should you enquire me about that? No. Samy has created many issues. Recently, he has chopped your finger also. That's why, did you take revenge? - If journalists think of lifting axe, none can do politics in Tamil Nadu. We use only pen to correct this country. Why do you ask only me? - Don't you know? My father has been accused for this. Brother, I don't know whether you know about your Dad. But we know. He is not that kind. He is a good honest guy. Nothing will happen to him. You go. Journalist Sir! Since he chopped your finger, you remain calm. You have got many relatives here. If one among them has done it, what will you do? For a peg, people might confuse you a lot. Don't ask all that. Go. He is saying as if I am confusing others for a peg. Listen. His newspaper has been sold here for 30Rs. I am in enquiry commission. None can have food without my permission. Get lost. - I am your Uncle. Samy got united with our family. So, did Rasu do anything? Cha! We shouldn't think like that. He looks rude. But actually, he is child like. He won't slap anyone. Once, he slapped the astrologer. That's it. Like how you have doubts, even he has got many doubts. Without Samy, Rasu has no power. Why should he kill him then? I need you. We will marry now itself. Listen. I will marry you. But after finding out your Uncle's killer. Come. - Hey, where are you taking me? You are asking the mode of murder to everyone. Did you ask me? I am your uncle. Uneducated lawyer and non posted police. Come. I will show you a beard fellow. He will tell everything. - Listen. I have left an important work. If I don't get a clue, I will immerse you in this water. Come. He is there only. He is boozing. Catch him. Now he will be eating mixture. I am watching him for the past 25 years. He is like this only. He will look at us. See. Ah! Ah! Ah! Hey, no. No. Don't kill me also like Samy. Hey! We are searching for Samy's killer. Why should we kill you then? Hey, come here. Don't be scared. Come. Come. - I won't harm you. Come. From starting onwards, you remained with Samy. Where did you create a problem? Hey, tell me. He will give you commission. Else, we will file a petition against you. Upon whom, are you filing a petition? If anyone abuses Rasu, he will beat them. How will I say who killed him? Not only that. Samy has slapped even a police guy also. Ilandhanur police station is not leaving the sand lorry. Call and tell them to leave it. What are you thinking? We will have to file minimum two cases per month. You will find some victim. You file the case upon him. I know whom to kill and whom to leave. You shut up and go. If Rasu's name gets published tomorrow after filing a FIR, If it gets published? - You will get a news that Inspector is dead. From your wife's flower, till her inner wears, It was bought in our money. Before I reach my house, the vehicle should reach the shed. Oh! Did you hear? In the name of Holy Spirit, Amen! God will remain with you! God will forgive only the unknown mistakes. Not the known mistakes. According to me, both Hindu Goddess and this Christian Mary Goddess. Both are same only. In this pure place, I am asking you. Who killed Samy? I saw the guy who killed Samy. Is it you? It's me only. I was waiting all these while to kill you. Do you think I was working for you and Rasu? It's not for that. I am there to kill you. Even her inner wears also, was bought in our money. You will have to finish him. All these while, I was stubborn that I am a police man's wife. In a single word, he insulted us in front of everyone. If you don't ruin him? You will insult me in front of my wife. Should I tolerate by seeing all that? Only when you die, my wife will accept me. Sir, he might die. Let's leave him. I am not born in the generation where I am scared of my life. By fearing for my life, I didn't surrender myself to you. I want to have food in my sister's daughter's wedding. After that, you kill me. - You die. Malar! He is saying about his sister's daughter's wedding. Let's leave him. Let him go. Please, sir! Is it a flower? Hmm. For the past 6 months, I am telling you to destroy the guy who insulted me. Whenever I tie the sari, I remember what he has said. In front of law, the khaki. It has no value. You and your father are not his target. Samy is his target. Brother, one minute. I committed the sin. So I will tell the truth as part of repentance. Within 10 days, he will get transferred to another place. Then you can't harm him in any way. Hey! If you keep thinking about that dead guy, what about whoever survives? Go. Go and do your work. - Mom, keep quiet. Brother, don't be angry. Calm down. What? - I want to talk. About what? - About Samy. Tell me. - What? Tell me. - You think that my Dad only killed Samy. I came to say that it's not true. Hey! Then who killed him? You know it. Tell me. Who is he? Tell me. - By knowing it, are you going to kill him? Get lost. - Hey! Do you want me to remain silent? I should kill that guy who killed Samy. - Hey! Is she your mother? She is your wife and she is your child. There are hundreds who trust you. Are you going to leave everyone? Please don't. Hey! All their lives are equivalent to Sami's life. Do you know who my Samy is? That's half of my body. He is my life. - If he is your life, he is my relative. The moment when I considered Malar as my wife, at that time itself, he is like my Dad. I will manage. "If I decide once", Who is that? - "I won't listen to myself". Hello! Who is it? Your conscience. - I don't have a thing like that. Like how you killed Samy, have you killed your conscience also? Hey! Who are you? - It's not important who I am. The moment when you got bribe, you didn't lose your sense. now, have you lost it at once? Today, we should decide whether a killer should wear Khaki or not. You must come to the place which I say. Hey, if I catch hold of you, I will squeeze you. Who is going to squeeze whom? We will see in palm tree forest. Come there. Hello! Tell me. You have come at the right time. So scared, right? Turn right and enter the forest. I always desire for you. Shall I give you one? What? - What will be given in phone? It will be kiss only. She is one... Tell me. - What so urgent? Is there any work left in your house? Look at the specs. Get down from your bike. Hey, I don't think you will leave after getting the money. I think you will die surely. Where are you? Come, James Bond! You have found out clearly. Today even if Lord of death denies, you will die in my own hands. Your Dad and Rasu should fight and die. Hence, I sent my guys to kill you. That day, you escaped. Today whoever comes, you won't escape. You are gone. Come. Come. Come. I won't leave you. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Hey, leave. Hey! Leave. Ah! What? Are you checking whether you are dead? You are alive only, fool! Now do you understand the value of life? Only when you lose something, you will understand its value. When you are about to die, you are scared and shed tears. A human's life is a surprise. It's the miracle created by God. In a single foetus, eye, ear, nose, mouth, blood and skin have been joined as a miracle. You are destroying it for some reasons. If you want to die like animals, what is the need of this sixth sense? Rascal! If I think, I can chop you here and bury. I have read. I have read already. When a mother gives birth to a child, it will pain as if 20 bones get broken. I am educated. When your Mom has given birth to you, it would have pained like that. I promised in front of Sami. I will lead a good life with her. That's the reason. Listen. Throw away your criminal sense. You surrender yourself to police. Tomorrow the first news which I am going to read, It must be that. Get lost. You killed Sami. Go and die. What is this? That is also a life. Cha!
