You've got to put some pressure on. MAN: How can a game have such an effect on man's soul? The way I see it, how can it not? You don't choose the game. It chooses you. And when it does, life and golf become forever connected. That's how it was for a young man named Luke Chisholm. You've got to be kidding me. ANNOUNCER: Once you make one mistake out of the water there, you just continue to make the same mistake over and over again. Are you hurt, son? I'll get over it. Yeah. You the guy I saw putting the flagstick in the field? Yeah, and you the guy that crashed through my fence? Here Let me help you. Johnny Crawford's the name. - Luke Chisholm. - Yeah. Yeah, let me see that. Yeah, look... Put a little pressure on there. It'll stop the bleeding. - All right. - Yeah. - Thanks. - I need to get you to my truck to get you some medical attention, all right? So let's get these clubs up here. You feel all right? You're not dizzy? No, I'll be all right. You're a hell of a driver. Megan Monroe had twins last week. Yeah. Haven't taken the sign down yet. The evening service... is just letting out. - WOMAN: Hey, Johnny. - Hey, how you doing? I went this morning, in case you was wondering. - Order up. - Let me guess. - Same as usual. - You got it. - All right, you all done there, darlin'? - Divine. How y'all doing here? Some more coffee? WOMAN AT TABLE: What's wrong with him asking her out? Oh, Sarah, I could use some more coffee. Excuse me. How you boys doing here? You gonna save a dance for me tonight? I'll think about it. She's just playing hard to get. Of course she is. Mama, it's Uncle Johnny. JOHNNY: Hi, everybody. This here's Luke. He's had a small accident, but, uh... Do we have that aid kit back there? I'll get it, Mom. MOTHER: Johnny, what in the world happened to this poor boy? Don't worry. He's gonna live. Mercy. Looks like you've been hit by a truck. More like a cow. You hit a cow? No, I missed the cow, but I did manage to run through the fence. MAN: City boy can't drive. Do you need a doctor? No, ma'am. I need a mechanic. Here you go. - Thank you. - Sure. We need some strong hands to get the car over to Brody's shop. Jake, be a dear and help Johnny. What about my burger? The poor man's car just got wrecked, and you're worrying about a burger? Where are your manners? JOHNNY: Come on, Jake. Let's go. Let's go. Jake, come on. SEATED MAN: Have fun. Come on, Smiley. You, too. Work some of that off. - Yes, sir. - Come on. - Come on, Chuck. JOHNNY: Let's go. - Sarah? - Hmm? Drive Luke to the inn. I'd be much... much obliged. Thank you. Sure. There you go. Just let me know whenever you're ready. Oh. Mom, we'll be right back. - Thank you, ma'am. - MOTHER: Drive careful. WOMAN: Are you right? Will this end in tears?  SARAH: Where you from? LUKE: Waco. But I've been on the road these past couple of years. Yeah? Me, too. - Really? - Mm-hmm. What for, school? I'm training to be a horse whisperer. I always thought horse whispering was only in the movies. But it's for real, huh? Yep. Well, good luck with that. Thank you. So where you taking me, anyway? Oh, we're just going to the River Inn. That's Uncle Johnny's place. Are you two related? No, he's just a close family friend, but I've always known him as Uncle Johnny. Here we are. Well, thanks for the ride. Right. Oh, you have to get that from the outside. Feeling it all as the wind blows  Feeling it all as the time goes  Do you feel my eyes right there on you?  Hello? Don't you even think about coming in here with those. You must be the one who ran off the road. What'd you do, fall asleep at the wheel? Well, come on. I don't have all day to check you in. Let's go. And close that door behind you. You're not bad looking. Blind as a bat, maybe. You married? The neighbor girl's looking for a husband. No, ma'am. I'm not married. Okay, now don't lose this key. It opens the front door, too, so you don't bother me when you drag in late. Yes, ma'am. There's extra towels in the cupboard there, but it's okay to use the same one twice. Breakfast is at 8:00. Don't be late. Hi there. Thanks for teeing it up with us here on Golf Central. I'm Todd Lewis, sitting beside Frank Nobilo, and, Frank, we begin with that unbelievable story happening at the Callaway San Antonio Open. Well, that's right, Todd. Luke Chisholm is a name that we've all had on our radar screens ever since he won the Texas State Amateur Championship. Folks, if you have not seen this highlight before, sit back and enjoy. It's something you will not forget. The winner of this tournament earns an exemption into the Valero Texas Open just a few weeks from now. Luke Chisholm had a one-shot lead on the final hole over Joe Buckner, Father Martin on the bag, and look who shows up on the tee: The number one player on the planet and the tournament's lead sponsor, T.K. Oh. What an intimidating presence. Well, that's enough to rattle anybody's cage, and in this situation, Luke Chisholm, he just blocks his tee shot way right. His dad Martin wanted him... Whoa. It's not the time to start playing it safe. Yeah, but if I make par, he's gotta make birdie to tie me. You're playing not to lose instead of playing to win. Here Remember who won the Masters last year? Well, that guy over there. Yeah, that guy over there. T.K. Oh got his fourth green jacket. Remember who come in second? Nobody remembers the runner-up, Luke. You can get on the green in two if you hit it with the big stick. That one hurt. You want to hit a few? Your hand up to it? CROWD: Ooh... ooh. MAN IN CROWD: Come on, Luke. Right into trouble. Thread the needle with a 3-iron. You bump and run it up on the green. I think I should just punch out right here. You got to put some pressure on. Hit the 3. Hit the 3, huh? Hey, Mama, there's an Easter egg hunt at the church tomorrow. Sounds like fun. Can we go, Dad? You got some practicing to do tomorrow. Martin, it's Easter Sunday. Sundays are reserved for golf. Son, you have to drop. That's playing to lose. You gotta listen to me. I've been listening to you my whole life and this is where it's got me. All right. Where you gonna put it? I hope he brought a snorkel. All right. Let's see what you got. You gotta pull yourself together here, son. Am I embarrassing you? You hooked it. You gotta watch your right hand. There you go. Let it release. Come on, now. Let's get something started here. Don't flip it. Come on, now. Come on. One more good one. MAN IN CROWD: In the hole! CROWD: Oh! Give me another one. CROWD: Oh! Well now, you're playing not to lose instead of playing to win. Nobody remembers the runner-up, Luke. - God! - You gotta put some pressure on him. Hit the 3. TODD LEWIS: He snaps his putter, flings the shaft, and then the sad shot here, his father Martin, walking away from son on the final hole. Oh, my goodness. He ends up shooting an 80 on the day. We're going to look at the one that started what I believe was the meltdown when he hit it into the hazard and going forth from there, Frank. What was going through his mind? FRAN NOBILO: Well, I think he was still smarting, Todd with the decision he made off the tee, whether to hit driver or 3-wood. That's obviously still in the back of his mind. And once you've made one mistake out of the water... I had a feeling there was more going on than meets the eye. Wow. He chilled good. NOBILO:... what could I have done differently instead. Just hitting never gets you out of trouble. LEWIS: The problem is, his ball remains... What do I got to do to get some food around here, kill a cow myself? NOBILO: So really, this is farcical. You've got no chance- Wow. That's no greens keeper. "PGA of America Half Century Club. " Hey, Luke, I was hoping you'd be here. You can tote these. Well, close your mouth, sugar. Let's go. Well, where we going? Hey, you're looking a whole lot better. I'm feeling better. You're in good hands with Mabel. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll feed you right, but it's my brother Johnny that you're gonna get the most from if you pay attention. Now where is my dance partner? Sarah? Sarah? Maybe you could just introduce Luke around. Oh, sure. Hey, you feeling any better? Oh, yeah. It's amazing what a shower and some clean clothes will do. You good with this, Duane? Yeah, go on. Am I ever gonna get to see you whisper to a horse? Well, I don't do that just in front of anybody, you know. What about dancing? You do that in front of anyone? Hey, look here. It's Tour boy. Jake Rustin, this is Luke Chisholm. Yeah, we had the pleasure earlier today at the diner. Yeah, that was right before I helped drag your car out of a cow patty. Wasn't too happy about it at the time. Then me and Sarah saw you on TV, remember? Hey, you're a regular celebrity. Not every day I get to help out a record holder. Hey, Jake, be quiet. Well, I had quite the meltdown. Oh, yeah. I especially liked that mud bath. The Golf Channel, they don't miss a thing. Jake. It's okay. Just let him talk. I'm sure he could have done a lot better. You play golf? I could hold my own. Yeah? On what course? The kind with windmills, volcanoes... - Come on, guys. - pirates? All right, can we be social? Let's play nice. I never shot a 16 on one hole before. Yeah, well, it was a 14. Sarah, it was a pleasure. You want to dance? Leave it all behind  I didn't see where it went. You hooked it. You gotta watch your right hand. Let it release. Don't flip it. Dad, it's getting dark. Well, I can see just fine. Come on, now. Let's finish what we started here. One more good one. Come on, now. JOHNNY: There you are. Hey. Tough day, eh? Yeah. Heh, I've had better. Yeah, well... I saw you on TV. I got to say it was painful to watch. Try living it. Believe it or not, I have. I believe it. I snooped around in your study. Yeah? Well, I chased the Tour for a while. Had my ups and downs. You want an observation? You were playing from back here, see? Tournament golf has to be played in front of you where the target is. That's a new one. You have the mechanics. You just don't know what it means to play the game in front of the ball. Well, I'm debating on picking up a club ever again. Well, I have a proposition for you. Spend seven days with me in Utopia, you'll find your game. Seven days? I don't know. Well, it'll take you that long to get your car fixed, you know? So think about it, all right? I'll be at the driving range 9 A.M. tomorrow morning. Sarah. Hey, Johnny. SARAH: I thought you could use some company. Gonna be fireworks soon. All right. I also wanted to apologize... for Jake. His dad basically disowned him after he chose the rodeo over the family business. But he's got a warm heart, that's for sure. I see. You two together? No. Everyone expects us to be, but... I don't know, especially Jake. So... well, what about you? Me. Mom and I lost my dad to cancer two years ago, so I suppose I'm just... taking each day as they come. I'm sorry. "I suppose" means God works in mysterious ways. Well, Johnny says he can help me with my game. Think I should take him up on his offer? Well, I think... I think some time here might do you good. "Donations appreciated. God bless. " Nice. You got game, son. You could have told me you owned this place. Well, you could have told me what really happened to your putter. What made you want to build a golf course out here? Well, originally I moved here to get away from the game, but easier said than done, I guess. So you quit the Tour? Well, the game just wasn't a good fit for me anymore. Yeah. Okay, listen, let's... let's get started. I want to see you hit some, all right? I want to see you swing. - Yeah, these are a little better. - Yep. Why do you grip the club that way? Well, I don't know. Just feels good. Well, that's the wrong answer. Now, let start from scratch, all right? I need to know why you do the things you do. Like the foundation for your swing, from the grip to the follow-through. Now go think about it and write it down. The first step in finding a good game is to find some conviction. You got that? Think about it. How'd I end up here? Unbelievable. The toughest challenge you'll face isn't the golf course or even your competitor's score. It's that casual comment offered by someone, anyone, about how you should be doing it. If you don't have conviction about where your foundation is, that off-handed comment will take you out of your game and erode your confidence. Now, you got that? Yes, sir. That's Ben Hogan. Yeah. The one and only. Place the club in my left hand with my thumb down the shaft. Place my right hand over my left thumb, my lifeline. That helps me cock my wrist in my backswing. That's good. And do it with ease. LUKE: You're not from here, are you? Well, not exactly. I've lived in a lot of places. Been around here and there with the military. No, I'm not from here. How'd you end up in Utopia? You ask a lot of questions, young fella. You really do. I burned all my bridges. There was no place to turn but here. A Tour player like you, the players you played with, why here? I'll tell you. Paul Hawkins was a student of mine way back when. That's Sarah's dad. He was a good man- a great man. He let me stay with them while I... got my act together. Been here ever since. Did you get in some kind of trouble? It's getting late. I'm gonna see you tomorrow down by the river. Daybreak, all right? What does the river have to do with golf? You'll see. You will see. JOHNNY: Rhythm, balance, patience. That's what you need to stay in your game. The same with fly fishing. It takes a calm mindset a focus on the feel, rather than the outcome. It takes emotional control. Hey? All right. JOHNNY: All right. Now, tell me. What was his downfall? Well, he... he took the bait. Yeah, but why? What made him fall into that trap? I'm not sure. 'Cause he was hungry? No, he was mad. I teased him with a shadow casting, never quite letting the fly touch the water, so I was able to take that fish out of his game today. Now, you ready to give it a try? All right, remember. To stay in balance in the skiff or during your golf swing, you have to control your emotions. Okay? Uh-huh. Breathe, Luke. Rhythm, balance, and patience. Johnny, I got one. JOHNNY: Now catch it. Keep the tip up. Seep the tip up. Take it as it comes. All right? Easy. Easy. Oh! Never fails. Got him, Johnny. Hey-hey-hey! Good job, son. Woo! How come you always seem to do things the hard way? - Good. - Hey! JOHNNY: Come here. I want to show you something. named Jack Nicklaus took me out of my game. You know how? By staying in his game. The calmer he was, the madder I got. And I tried shots I wouldn't ordinarily take. Now, this look familiar? A little hiccup on 18. Well, at least you got beat by the golden bear. Yeah, and so would you have. Ha ha ha. Now tomorrow we actually meet at the course. Fifth fairway. I'm sorry. It's not good to be late in life, son. Time is too precious to waste. I said I was sorry. If this was a tournament, you'd be disqualified. Now, you want to play like a professional, you have to act like one, all right? Now take a seat. Take a seat. Today... we're gonna paint. All right? Paint? All right. All golf shots start with a blank canvas. We paint the shot with our eyes first... so our bodies can reproduce it accurately. Now... what kind of shot could you make from here? - Well, I think- - No, no, no. Don't think. See. Okay. I see a low punch eight iron. Playing the ball back in my stance with a slightly hooded clubface. I can see the ball flying about 30 yards with some hook-spin, landing on the upslope of that hill, bouncing up and going in the cup. Okay. Now go paint it. - Morning. - Morning. - Just paying a visit to Paul. - Yeah. So hard. Mm... Hey, Mama, you gonna be all right? Just give me a minute? - Right, honey. You go have fun. - Take care. Can't believe it's been two years. Yeah. I miss Paul most every day. - Yeah. - Yeah? Whoa-ho-ho. Yeah. Whoa-ho-ho. Ohh. Ah. - Hi. - Hey. LUKE: You look nice. Well, thank you. So your Uncle Johnny, he's a real piece of work today. Yeah, well, it's actually kind of a rough day for all of us. It's the second anniversary of Dad's passing. - Oh. - It's okay. Is there anything I can do? Well, I was gonna ask you... My father and I used to go up to Obra Maestra on his birthday. I was thinking of going out there later today, and I could really use the company. It'd be an honor. Okay. I see Uncle Johnny's got you painting already. Yeah, he does. I wasn't expecting that. Looks like we're gonna have to add another shelf. Maybe one day there'll be Tour trophies on that shelf. Ain't no maybes in this world, Luke. You understand? Yes, Dad. Good. Now rephrase what you just said to me. Well, one day there will be Tour trophies on this shelf. I'm counting on it, son. I'm proud of you. You ready, cowboy? Obra maestra means masterpiece in Spanish. I can see why. Sure is beautiful. Might even go as far as call it Utopia. Yeah. I suppose you might. You ever think of living somewhere else? Well, everything I need's right here. I'm free to be myself. Free to do the things I was born to do. What is that? Bring freedom to horses. And, uh, the occasional stranger. JAKE: Come on. Hyah, hyah! Move! Jake. Jake, you're coming too close. You're gonna scare the horses. Come on! Come on! Whoa. What are you doing out here with him? I'm taking a ride. I didn't know I needed your permission. So, Tour boy, choke on anything lately? Yeah, well, at least I got a sport to choke on. And what do y'all play out here, mutton busting? You know what us Tour boys say about hicks and sheep, don't you? That's real funny. I don't know who you think - you're talking to. - Boys. Hey, quit it! Now, you're acting like a couple of children. Jake! Chuck, get him off! You heard the lady. Get off me! Now, how about you two hotheads settle this over a friendly little game of cowboy poker after the rodeo tonight? MAN: Woo! ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final event of the evening. Hold onto your seats. It's time for cowboy poker. Introducing our players: Duane "Slim" Pickens and Chuck Baer as the usual suspects. Four-time Utopia Rodeo champion Jake Rustin. And our final player, he's a first-timer, so let's give a warm Utopia welcome for professional golfer Luke Chisholm. All right, boys, deal the cards and let's get this party started. Time to put up or shut up. All right. What are we playing? Texas Hold 'em. Oh, yeah, but there's a catch. You got to hold on to your chair. Why? You'll see. The last man still in their seat in the end wins 200 bucks! ANNOUNCER: Watch out. He's got his sights set on the usual suspects. Chuck's all in. MAN: Go get him, Cannonball. ANNOUNCER: Who's Cannonball gonna go for next? MAN: Watch out, Slim! Keep your butt in the chair. Aa-aa-ahh! Whah! JAE: It's you and me. Let's see what you got. Boys. MAN: Atta boy, Jake! Whoa! ANNOUNCER: And the winner is the rookie! Dang it! Yeah! Proud of you, son. Hey, Luke, Luke, what's next for you? Is it time to go pro? Um... Well, this hasn't even sunk in yet, so I'm just gonna try to enjoy this feeling and, uh- He's a humble kid. Uh, what he means to say is yes. He will be turning pro. Of course he'll be turning pro, and we'll begin to look for a sponsor's exemption immediately. MAN: Woo! All right! - Yeah! - Good going, Luke! I'm sorry. Yeah, I know. Laugh it up. Hey, speaking of manure, where'd the rhinestone cowboy go? I was ready to gloat. Well, Jake went off in a huff. He doesn't like to lose. Well, that makes two of us. Hm.. Well, there's more to life than winning, right? Like what? Family. Friendship. Faith. Love. Oh, yeah. I guess those, too. All right, Johnny's got the horses hitched up. It's time to go. You know, cowboy? Sometimes I think you might just be hopeless. Hey, Luke. Get in here, smelly. Come on in here. I hung up your masterpiece. You forgot to sign it. What's this? Oh, that? Oh, that bottle's my greatest trophy. No, let me explain. It's the last liquor I ever drank. Doesn't it tempt you? No, just the opposite. Makes me remember all the things I lost because, uh, I drank too much. That's why I put it there. Is that why you quit the Tour? Well, more or less, yes. More or less, yeah. Pretty hard to drink and drive, eh? Yeah. Well, I'm sorry about this morning, being late and all. No, no, I'm not. I am not. Learn how to paint your shot, you learn how to be on time. A professional golfer does both. Now, sign your masterpiece, Picasso. LUKE: Where we headed, anyway? JOHNNY: Going to work on your putting. Well, the golf course is back that way. Uh-huh. Yeah, it is. I thought you said we was going to work on some putting. That's right. That's right. We are. Come on. I hope you brought some of your winnings from last night. Well played, gentlemen. Well played. Hear, hear. Keep practicing. Well, look who he dragged in here with him. You a little stiff this morning? Still sore I beat you last night. You better watch it. JOHNNY: Enough of that, Jake, knock it off. Hey, Jake, come on, come on. Get the washers, all right? Let's get the game started here. Come on. Same old Jake. Come on. Okay. Now, the rules are simple. The man who's up pitches from behind the marker of his choice. Yeah, but I don't see what this has to do with golf. You just watch. Just watch. Just watch. See? Ooh! You owe me five bucks, boys. You ready to give it a try? Yeah, sure. Come on. Don't make me look bad, now. All right, it's on, boys. There's not a chance he'll make this. You gonna put your money where your mouth is? - Ooh. - You're on. It's a bet, Jake. Ho-ho! - Beginner's luck. - Woo! Here Let's see you do that again. All right. All right. MAN: Everybody  Needs a woman's love, now  Yes! I like this game. Crazy, cowboy. Hey, knock it in, man. Oh! I'm gonna move  I got to work it on out  He's better than you! Early in the mornin'  I play a few more now  Well, bend it on out  Woo! Yeah! Yeah! Come on. - Come on. - Woo-hoo! Let's go. Ooh. - We're even. - We're even. Come on, Slim! I like it like that  - Oh, come on! Everybody  - That's the one! Play it. Needs somebody  Yeah! Everybody  - Ohh-ho. - I'm impressed. Needs a little love now  Oh, mercy  Make me proud, son. You make me proud. Watch his form. Right off the fingers. I'm the rodeo king! You know what I love about the cowboy way? Everything! Hey! Woo! Okay, boys. Let's go. Let's go. We're going to the links now. We're gonna do some putting. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Pitching washers... give me an idea for a putting technique. You're kidding, right? No, no, sir. I have a respect for tradition, but I have a passion for the truth, okay? Now, here. - Jake? - Yes, sir. Use the face-on putter. You use the traditional one. Quiet in the peanut gallery here. Come on, Jake. Help me out. Get in the hole. Get in the hole! Yes! Oh-ho-ho-ho! - Here you go, Tour boy. - It's gonna be a good day for me. Good. Good. You try. Come on, rookie. Make me some money. - BOTH: Oh! Ooh. Aah... This is fun. Miss it. Miss it. No, no, no. Yes! I'm impressed. You ready to give this one a try? - Sure. - Here you go. When in Utopia, right? DUANE: Come on. Let's go. More drinks for me tonight. Let's go. CHUCK: Ain't no way. Come on, now. - This look right? - Yeah. No way. No way. No way. No-oh, yeah! All right, let me ask you something. Would you or could you use this in competition? I'd probably get laughed off the course, but it definitely works. Yeah. No, you keep it. 'Cause when the time comes, you'll know when to use it. Okay. LUKE: You have any kids? No, sir. That's one of my biggest regrets. I saw your wedding photo. Oh, you snooping around again, are you? You snooping? You're a super snooper. - I'm sorry. - You're a real snooper. Well, that's a cool study room. Pictures of all those legends. No. Annie, my Annie, couldn't have kids. She used to joke that she didn't need any 'cause she had me. Yeah. Well, if you don't mind me asking, what happened? Well, she's... she's gone on. Couldn't put up with my drinking anymore. Can't say I blame her. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, well... gone but not forgotten. Yeah. As they say... all part of God's plan. Yeah, I suppose. Good night. Night. See you in the morning. You bet. LUKE: Let me guess. This is where you drop me off in the middle of nowhere and expect me to get back home with the clothes on my back and two golf tees in my pocket. That'd be way too easy. - Wow. - That's it. - Is this yours? - Yes, she is. Yeah. Um... You're not planning on going up in this thing, though, are you? Well, why not? I mean, flying's a lot like golf. Shoo. Eh? Ah? No. You said fly fishing was a lot like golf. - Did I say that? - Yeah. All right, maybe I did. You ready? - No way. - Why? I'm keeping my feet on the ground today. Oh, yeah? LUKE: Whoa. I don't know about this, Johnny. Let's turn back. JOHNNY: Your feet control direction with the rudder. - The stick controls the wings and pitch. - Okay. Now, to turn, you press one foot and turn the wheel in that direction. LUKE: Turn the wheel in the direction. - And to go up or down, push or pull. - Push or pull, yeah. - Got it? - Okay. LUKE: Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Okay. - Okay. No hands, see? Like this. You're doing good. LUKE: All right. I'm getting it now. I'm getting it. I think I'm getting it. JOHNNY: It's like riding a horse. Seep her steady. Uh-oh. Ooh-ooh-ooh... What's... Wait, wait, wait. What just happened? What-Johnny? - Hold on. Hold on. - What happened? JOHNNY: We have an emergency. We have an emergency. - LUKE: Whoa! - Put the plane down. Johnny, you take it. Take it. You take control of this aircraft, son. All right? I don't know what to do. Keep the nose down and level the wings. All right? - Okay. - All right. JOHNNY: That's good. Good. - All right. You're all right. - How's that? - All right, now go- - We should try to go back, shouldn't we? No, we can't get back. We have to find a place around here. Come on. Come on. There's a-There's a wheat field. All right. Good. You're doing great, son. Keep your wits about you, okay? Level your wings. You got 500 feet to go. How about that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're doing great. Steady. Steady. Steady. Bring it in. Bring it in. Steady. - Wings level. Keep the wings level. - Okay. Leveling my wings. Is this good? We good? Great. You're doing great. Leveling. Leveling. Bring it in. Bring it in. Well, coming in, coming in. Wait. What-What happened here? - Goodness me. - What? The engine was turned off. Did you turn the engine off? LUE: The engine turned off? Is this your idea of a sick joke? Why are you laughing? Confidence comes with being prepared, my son. As in golf or life, hand in hand. I'm about to throw up over here. You can't play in a tournament unless you're ready for the unexpected on game day. MABEL: It smells delicious. SARAH: Mabel's trout's famous around here. More famous than her pies? Couldn't be more famous. As famous, maybe. But more famous? For food in a world where many walk in hunger, for faith in a world where many walk in fear, for friends in a world where many walk alone, we give you thanks, O Lord. Amen. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. He definitely puts the game first. Reminds me of someone else I used to know. That he does. Hopefully he finds his way quicker than me. - Hey there, stranger. - Hey. So, uh, when's the last time you caught a firefly? Well, I don't know. Since I was a little kid. Well, that's too long. Come on. She has Paul's gift. She always was a daddy's girl. It's okay. It's okay. - Hey, Sarah. - What? These ones in here quit making light. Well, that's 'cause they know they're trapped. It makes their lights go out. Watch this. Freedom's a powerful force. Not yet. I'm sorry. No, I- It doesn't mean never. It's gonna... It's gonna rain. Ready for today's lesson? I can only imagine what you got in store for me today. Today we play golf. Good. What should I hit, a driver? No, no, no, no. Today we visit the history of the game and its future. You're gonna be playing with hickory sticks and a face-on putter. Ooh. Not bad. Perfect. S F T. One for you. See it. Feel it. Trust it. Little butter cut over that left tree. How far? About 310. What's the course record? Well, you ever shot a 59? You keep playing this way, you just might. Weather permitting, of course. - Boom. - Yes, sir. Not sure we can get this round in. There ain't nothing stopping me. I'm seeing it, feeling it, and trusting it. It's time to wrap it up, son. It's not the time to start playing it safe. We got one more hole. No, no, no. Well, it matters to me. That's not the lesson. That was never the lesson. You spent the whole week teaching me how to play the best golf of my life. Now I'm playing it. All right. Well, you don't have to prove anything to me, Luke, because I'm not your father. You don't know anything about my dad, so back off! No! you can't spend your life trying to validate yourself with a golf score. Well, how would you know? It looks to me like you quit on your dream, living out here on this godforsaken goat ranch. And this is your dream today? This? This is your dream? JOHNNY: You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink! Woo. I'm sorry, Johnny. I forgive you, son. Whose grave you digging? You'll soon see. What's yours gonna say? Mine? Yeah, your epitaph, your headstone. What do you want people to say about you when you're gone, huh? Maybe it'll say you shot a... a 59. Huh? I never thought of it like that. Maybe we'll just leave it blank for now. No. I mean... I'd want it to say... something. It will. It will. But I don't think that your coming here... was an accident. But only you can decide what to do from here on out, 'cause, I mean, there's nothing more I can teach you, son. Woo. Thank you, Johnny. No, don't thank me. Thank Him. 'Cause God is all around us. Inside of each of us, if you listen... there's a still, small voice of truth leading us... talking to us... and telling you that you... can see God's face... feel his presence... trust his love. Yeah. S F T. Huh? Woo. S F T. God bless you. Happy Easter. JOHNNY: Luke, inside this box is a pencil and two pieces of paper. One is for writing down all the truths you've learned during your time here in Utopia. The truth that life is about faith, relationships, character, and integrity. That God has a purpose and calling for you that is much deeper than a little white ball falling into the cup. These truths will become your new heartbeat, the foundation of your new life. The other piece of paper is for writing down all the lies you've been told during your life. Lies like your golf score being a reflection of your true identity and self-worth, or that failure in golf is failure in life. Take the truths with you, but bury the lies right here, right now. Once you have buried your lies, chisel your living epitaph. MAN: Today I found myself  After searching all these years  And the man that I saw  He wasn't at all who I thought he'd be  I was lost when you found me here  I was broken beyond repair  Then you came along  - Yeah! And you sang your song  Over me  It feels like I'm born again  It feels like I'm living  For the very first time  I'm living for the first time  It feels like I'm born again  It feels like I'm living  For the very first time  It feels like I'm breathing  It feels like I'm moving  For the very first time  In my life  All ready to go, are we? Yeah, I think so. Don't think. See, feel, trust. Yeah. Now, before you leave, I have something for you. I have something here. Well, you've given me more than I can repay, sir. Well, gifts aren't meant to be repaid. They're meant to be passed along. Look at this. That was my last tournament. You notice anything? Huh? Well, you're not on the leaderboard. Well, yeah, that, but no. Look again. Look again. Look. - Oh, it's the Texas Open. - Right. That's this weekend. Yeah. The tournament's main sponsor is an old friend. He says as a personal favor he'll offer you one of his free exemptions. All right? Huh? Man. Well, I don't... I don't know what to say. Well, I think, between you and me, it's all about the ratings. He's probably hoping you have another meltdown, and I'm hoping that you can prove him wrong. Yeah. Well, you can count on it. Oh, yeah. Now, don't go running over any of them cows, because I don't want you to ruin my pie. Well, don't worry. I can see a little better now. Yeah, you can. Okay. God bless you, son. God bless you. Aw, I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss y'all, too. Thank you so much for everything. You bet. Got you a little gift. Just keep the lid off it and you can come visit whenever you want. Well... till next time, then. Next time. You need any more putting lessons, you just let me know. Hey, Tour boy. Well, if you need some lessons on some cowboy poker, well... you're just gonna have to figure it out yourself. Johnny. Yeah. Thank you for everything. No. I want to thank you for everything. I really do. Yeah. And, son, I do believe. Okay? Yes, sir. God bless you. - God bless you. - Thank you. Let's get you something to eat. Yes, Mom. Hey, Bud. I got you a, uh, little present. Callaway's latest and greatest. Thanks, Dad. Luke, uh... my actions last week... were wrong. I... I pushed you your whole life to succeed at golf, and I never once asked if that's what you wanted. I'm sorry for that. Well, I forgive you. I only want what's best for you. I know. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, son. Well... Ain't looked at mine in a while. Might be overdue. Good night, son. Welcome home. Hey, Dad. Yeah? I almost forgot. You want to caddy for me this week in the Texas Open? FEMALE SPORTSCASTER: Welcome, everyone, to the pride of the Lone Star State, the Valero Texas Open. I'm Kelly Tilghman with PGA Tour winner Brandel Chamblee. A compelling story this week, Brandel, is the sponsor invite, Luke Chisholm. BRANDEL: How does one go from oblivion to center stage? This man knows, Kelly. In his first PGA Tour event, he has a chance for redemption. COURSE ANNOUNCER: Now on the first tee, from Waco, Texas, Luke Chisholm. BRANDEL: Round two and three saw heated action atop the leaderboard. Some of golf's biggest names pining for the lead. Rich Beem, Stewart Cink, T.K. Oh, and Ricky Fowler. MAN: Come on, T.K. Oh! KELLY: This pressure-filled Sunday at the Texas Open offers an abundance of characters. Stewart Cink, four-time Masters champ T.K. Oh, and we have a local talent with fresh wounds. BRANDEL: The surprise performance coming from Luke Chisholm, just two weeks removed from that complete meltdown at the Lone Star event in San Antonio. And now, he finds himself chasing, of all people, T.K. Oh, atop the leaderboard. And, Kelly, you really couldn't script it any better than this. No. No, you can't, Brandel. We've seen Cinderella stories before, but we've also seen what T.K. Oh has done to those glass slippers. He has crushed them. BRANDEL: And we pick up with Luke Chisholm now on the 10th tee. Let's hit 3-wood. Fairway's a little tight. KELLY: Chisholm playing it safe here with the 3-wood on this very reachable par 5. MAN: That's okay, Luke. BRANDEL: And that shot will very likely put some demons in his head. It was a shot almost identical to that that started his monumental blowup a few weeks ago. Luke's gonna have to conquer those demons if he wants to win, and that is one of the toughest things to do in golf. Well, what you want to do, son? Go back to the tee. MAN: Head up, Luke. Well, it's gonna be one heck of a par, Dad. Oh, you got it. BRANDEL: Having taken an unplayable lie on his first drive, Chisholm is now back on the tee hitting his third shot. Looks like he's going with the driver this time, Brandel. And, Kelly, I don't know why he didn't use the driver the first go-around. He hasn't sniffed missing a tee shot all week long with that Callaway Octane driver. Perfect! Exactly as he has all week long. See you in the clubhouse, boys. Y'all play well. KELLY: A par after taking an unplayable could be a turning point for Chisholm. This Sunday has given us a great leaderboard. Rich Beem capable of a big charge, question marks surrounding Luke Chisholm, and T.K. Oh as intimidating as ever. KELLY: But it looks like we're winding down to just two. A classic David and Goliath story between Chisholm and T.K. Oh. Chisholm from 12 feet... and he sinks it! Luke Chisholm just one back of T.K. Oh. BRANDEL: You know he's licking his chops right here, not only to make birdie, but to put the pressure on T.K. Oh to do the same and avoid a playoff. Remember, T.K. Oh eagled this hole yesterday. And now Luke Chisholm with his second shot to this par 4 on the 18th hole. MAN IN CROWD: In the hole! Yeah! KELLY: The pressure is really on T.K. Oh now. He has no choice but to go for the green. - Oh, yeah! - Woo! Looking good! KELLY: This one's looking good, Brandel. It's on the green with a chance at eagle. BRANDEL: He makes it look easy, doesn't he, Kelly? ELLY: What an answer by the steely veteran T.K. Oh, who drove the green. If he makes this eagle putt, he wins. KELLY: And how's this for excitement? T.. Oh and Chisholm are headed to a playoff, both men tied at 16 under. BRANDEL: And T.. Oh has the upper hand once again. He's never been defeated in a playoff on the PGA Tour, and Luke Chisholm, his first taste in extra holes. KELLY: They're going back to the 18th tee, where anything can happen. T.K. Oh and Luke Chisholm are about to tee off on one of the greatest risk/reward holes in all of golf. And earlier, Brandel had a chance to take a closer look at this tremendous finishing hole. The finishing hole here is a great one. A drivable par 4 of 355 yards that plays downhill and gives the players a lot of choices. But those choices come with risks. The green is protected by a tree and a bunker and a treacherous water hazard. The green itself is very narrow and fast, with a lot of slope in it. And a two-putt from above the hole is highly unlikely. But one of the worst places that a player could drive the ball would be long and to the left, in that area there, because an up and down would be almost impossible. And his pitch shot would most likely run off the front of the green. WOMAN IN CROWD: Come on, T. ELLY: And there you have it, folks. This hole provides the perfect stage for the drama that's about to unfold. MAN IN CROWD: Come on, T.K., let's win this! Well, no surprise here, folks. T.K. Oh has taken driver out. Obviously trying to make an eagle and win this thing outright. But in doing so, he brings double bogey into play. T.K. Oh lives for moments like this. KELLY: And T.K. Oh is one of perhaps just 10 players who can drive this green. We saw him do it just moments ago in regulation. Oh, it sounds like he crushed that one. BRANDEL: Yeah, it's a good-looking swing. Always in balance. It took off on the right line. But there's more wind now than there was earlier. He's getting more help, and with his high ball flight, carrying that creek should not be a problem, but holding this green will be. KELLY: Oh, look at this. This could be serious trouble. That's the danger zone Brandel was just describing. MAN IN CROWD: One more shot, T.K.! KELLY: Luke Chisholm going with the conservative play, iron off the tee. BRANDEL, Yeah, no surprise there, Kelly. He's stuck to that game plan all week, and with only one exception has he strayed from the fairway. He's looking to put this ball in a spot where he gets the right number, gets a wedge in his hand, and he can put the pressure on T.K. Oh. KELLY: Luke seems relaxed. Is this the same player from two weeks ago? BRANDEL: No, it's not the same player. He may have the same swing, but a completely different outlook. LUKE: What do we got? MARTIN: 75 yards... LUKE: Uh-huh. MARTIN: Just like in regulation. LUKE: Yeah. MARTIN: Lob wedge. LUKE: Thank you. BRANDEL: This is the same shot he had just a few moments ago, however, the situation is entirely different. He knows that given T.K. Oh's lie, he could win this tournament. Whereas a few moments ago, he was chasing. LUKE: See it. Feel it. And trust it. KELLY: Not quite like his hole out in regulation, but under the circumstances, a very solid shot. BRANDEL: If T.K. Oh was looking for a gift from an inexperienced Luke, he didn't get it. T.K. Oh a nearly impossible pitch. He's looking at a tight flag, the green is running away from him, not to mention the water. Anything short of hitting that flagstick and he's probably going swimming. BRANDEL: Plain and simple here, Kelly. He needs to play away from the hole. And it's a pretty safe bet that he's gonna have a longer birdie putt than Luke's 8-footer. KELLY: The ultimate test for T.K. Oh, but I wouldn't put it past him. He's done it before. BRANDEL: Look at the way he's sizing this up. It almost looks like- and he is, I think, gonna go right at this hole. This absolutely makes no sense to me. If he doesn't hole this, it's very likely that this ball's gonna run off of the green. KELLY: This would really be something. He's got to aim right for the flagstick. Anything short of perfect here, he's looking at bogie at best. That's if he's lucky enough to avoid the water. BRANDEL: The only way to pull this shot off on that line is with a lot of speed, a lot of spin, and he has to land it in an area about as big as a dinner plate. KELLY: And it looks good. It's got a chance. Didn't go in. Remarkable! BRANDEL: He's unlucky, Kelly, that that ball didn't go in, but lucky that it stayed on the green and gave him about a 15-foot putt up the hill, and maybe he can put the pressure on Luke. KELLY: And look at him. He's not even fazed. This is a makeable putt for T.K. Oh. Is this where experience pays off? BRANDEL: Generally speaking, first-in in a playoff wins. And if he makes this, I promise you, that hole will look a lot smaller to Luke. KELLY: How many times has T.K. Oh been in this exact spot and emerged victorious? It's that mental edge that makes him the great player that he is. CROWD: Oh! T..: Ooh! KELLY: He thought he had that one. BRANDEL: T.K. Oh's tee shot left him with a lot of stress. His second shot left him with a lot of work. And now it's Luke who has the work to do, and T.K. Oh no longer has control of his own fate. That control lies with Luke Chisholm. KELLY: It was a great par for T.K. Oh just to stay in it. But now the door is open for Luke Chisholm to win the Texas Open. BRANDEL: One can only imagine what's going on in the mind of Luke Chisholm right now. Two weeks ago his career was over, and now he is one putt away from taking the Texas Open and beating the best player in golf in the process. JOHNNY: Luke knew this putt was meaningless in the big picture. He was now answering to a higher calling. It was time to go to a place beyond tradition, to a place of buried lies and unearthed truths. A revolution had begun within Luke's soul. He had a purpose and a calling that went beyond any scoreboard. - What? - It's kind of a putter. JOHNNY: He saw, felt, trusted, and stroked the putt of his life. Utopia is defined as a place of mythical perfection, but I knew differently. Utopia is indeed real. It's a place where the voice of truth resides and eternal trophies line the shelves. A place where there are no accidents. I guess you're asking yourselves whether or not he made the putt. The better question is, does it really matter? How can a game have such an effect on a man's soul? WOMAN: Feel your eyes  On me  Shine your light  On me  I'll catch your fall  Struck a match, the rest is buried  Wishin' I could write this story  Like a star, you float into the air  Feeling it all  As the wind blows  Feeling it all  As the time goes  Do you feel my eyes right there on you?  Morning light  Brings me  To your side  Skin heats  I breathe it all  On a train, the tracks are hazy  Through the fog our voices carry  Evening falls, but you're in perfect view  Feeling it all  As the wind blows  Feeling it all  As the time goes  Do you feel my eyes right there on you?  Quiet all, live in silent days  Steady fall for you  Feeling it all as the wind blows  Feeling it all as the time goes  Do you feel my eyes right there on you?
