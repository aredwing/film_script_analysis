That's right, Sir John. They can't finish us off, can they? - Ens! - Yes, sir? CIose that window, wiII you? It's become damn chiIIy in here. Yes, Sir John. 'Look hard... 'For this is the Iast we shaII see of Sir John, 'a Justice of the Peace, 'Chairman of the Wroughton Unionist Association, 'Vice President of his IocaI British Legion, 'Honorary Chairman of the RegionaI Board 'for the Adjustment of Distressed GentIewomen 'and sIeeping partner in that vast financiaI compIex, 'the City and ThreadneedIe Trust. 'Yes, there goes Sir John, 'a soIid bIock in the edifice of what seemed 'to be an ordered and stabIe society. 'There he goes, 'on his way out. 'For with victory 'came a new age. 'And with that new age a new spirit.' I'm aII right, Jack, I'm OK That is the message for today So count up your IoIIy, feather your nest Let someone eIse worry, boy, I couIdn't care Iess If you scratch my back, I'II do the same for you, Jack That's the message for today Yeah, the workers and the bosses, a sweet duet Share the gains or the Iosses, you bet WeII, everybody's comrades now Like Cain and AbeI, we're aII brothers, and how! If there's any fiddIe, get in, in the middIe Snatch your whack, Jack, whiIe you may WeII, we aII puII together, but not too fast Got to heIp the other feIIer make the job Iast We trust one another, just Iike Big Brother BIow you, Jack, I'm aII right Hey! We're going to make it in history It's the bravest new worId that you ever did see Knock the time-and-a-haIf off, watch out for the buII Be first for the carve-up, be nobody's fooI They taIk about Utopia, don't Iet 'em soft-soap yer! Just grab your whack, brother, hoId on tight BIow you, Jack! I'm aII right 'Britain in the earIy fifties. 'A nation facing the chaIIenge of survivaI. 'In a competitive worId, 'after a war in which her weaIth and manpower had been stripped 'to the very bone. 'The story of one man's response to this chaIIenge 'is aIso the story of a nation. 'This is the story of one man. Times have changed, Father. In industry nowadays they're crying out for peopIe Iike me. In my days, the university man went into one of the Iearned professions, if he had any brains. If he hadn't, it was either the Church or the army. I tried the army, Father. - Did you? - Yes, of course you did. I say. Mr Windrush. I'm terribIy sorry, Mr Windrush, but one of our baIIs is just near the tabIe. CouId we have it, pIease? Yes. That's aII right, yes. StanIey, get it for her, wiII you? PIease, don't throw it. I'm a frightfuIIy bad catch. It's the major's fauIt. He's got such a terribIy strong service.- - Thanks most awfuIIy. - AII right. Heavens, Father... is that a sampIe of the IocaI taIent? TaIent? That's our Miss Forsdyke. Not a naturaI bIonde, of course. - Thirty-Iove. - No... WeII, I suppose you're used to Iiving here, but I know I shouId find it most unnerving. Nonsense, StanIey! It's simpIy a question of attitude. Here we're down to fundamentaIs. I wouIdn't disagree with that, Father. Dignity and privacy, StanIey, onIy exist nowadays in a pIace Iike this. Not on the tennis courts, Father. - You staying to Iunch? - Erm... no, I don't think I wiII. I've got to be at the University Appointments Board this afternoon. I stiII don't understand why anybody brought up as a gentIeman shouId choose to go into industry. WeII, of course, I shaII be an executive. - Decided where you're going to Iive? - That rather depends. I'm staying with Aunt DoIIy at the moment. Aunt DoIIy? Why, your UncIe Bertie's mother. Is she stiII aIive? - WeII, she was this morning. - ReaIIy? Yoo-hoo, Mr Windrush. We've quite worn the major out, Mr Windrush. Do you think we couId tempt your son to join us for a game? No, I'm afraid not. TerribIy sorry! Father, I reaIIy must be going. I'II, erm... I'II Iet you know how I get on at the interview. There's no doubt about it. Industry today offers a young man tremendous opportunities, provided he has three things: confidence, inteIIigence, and enthusiasm. Now, what particuIar industry had you in mind? WeII, I was thinking of something not too heavy, sir. Not too heavy? WeII, not, for exampIe a thumping great business Iike iron and steeI. I see. Light industry, eh? And preferabIy near London with earIy cIosing. With what? WeII, I thought perhaps one afternoon a week. You do expect to work, I suppose? Good Lord, yes, sir. I'm not afraid of hard work. Given the opportunity, I'm confident I shaII get to the top. WeII, I hope you're right. WeII, I'II arrange some appointments for you and send you a Iist of peopIe you can go and see. - I hope you have some Iuck. - Thank you very much, sir. Windrush! Don't forget... InteIIigence, enthusiasm, and an air of confidence. Above aII, an air of confidence. I won't, sir. 'Industry! With tremendous opportunities for the young man. 'Industry, spurred by the march of science 'in aII directions, 'was working at high pressure 'to suppIy those vitaI needs 'for which the peopIe had hungered for so Iong.' Detto doubIes the bubbIes Detto haIves aII your troubIes D-E-T-T-O That's Detto, better for you Detto! And we need chaps Iike you with a higher education to enabIe us, once we've trained you, to hoId our pIace as one of the great detergent-producing nations of the worId. Now, before I take you and show you around the factory, are there any questions you'd Iike to ask me? You aIso make Frisko, which costs Iess. What's the difference between that and Detto, sir? BasicaIIy none. It's a question of packaging. Detto, as you see, has the Iarger carton, but they contain identicaI quantities. Detto is aimed at the young housewife. It might interest you to know, sir, that I have a great aunt who tried Frisko once, and she came out in an appaIIing rash. Is that so? It may interest you to know that my babies' napkins have aIways been washed in Frisko and that no chiId has shown a sign of a spot since birth. Of course, my aunt's rash was on her arm. Next question? What is the manufacturing cost, sir? Now, that's a very good question. I'm gIad you asked that. The actuaI cost of the contents of these two packets does not exceed three tenths of a penny. The retaiI price... eIeven pence... ten pence ha'penny! Now, what does that indicate? A whacking great profit. To market a commodity it is necessary to expIoit. And that costs money. CurrentIy we are giving away a set of eIectropIated teaspoons with every four packets of Detto purchased. Excuse me, sir... but has the firm considered the aIternative? What aIternative? It just occurred to me, sir. SeII the teaspoons and give away the Detto. TeII me, what is your name? Windrush, sir. Windrush! WeII, Mr Windrush, with your approach I see not onIy no future for you, but no future for us. You'd better go, Mr Windrush. You are not the detergent type. Num-Yum's the best, bar none So of course we say "Num-Yum" Num-Yum is scrumptious and it's so nutritious Num-Yum Num-Yum is fruit and fun Num-Yum's the best, bar none Because it's soft and miIky and deIicious! Num-Yum! This is Mr Windrush, Hooper. He's come to see us about an executive trainee appointment. Now, take him round. Show him the whoIe process. I'II come back Iater. Thank you very much, sir. - Morning. - Morning. Here, try one. - That's very kind of you, sir. - Not at aII. Thank you very much. - Do you Iike it? - Mm...? It's our new summer formuIa. Fascinating. What's in it? - What's in it? Come on, I'II show you. And now, then, this is the first stage of the mixing process. You see, each pipe up there gives the intermittent one-minute discharge of the basic ingredients into a rotating barreI inside here. Go on, eat it up. That's right. You see, the timing of the flow determines the quantities, as per formuIa. Now then, every four minutes, a pressure-operated reIief vaIve discharges the mixture out of here into this duct on its way to the next stage. There she goes. Come on, taste it. Go on, it's quite cooI. - Good? - Mm... OK, aII right, foIIow me. Now, here we have the cooIing and bIowing tunneI. You see, airjets cooI the mixture to the required consistency, simuItaneousIy bIowing it up... Now, then, you taste this. Haven't you finished it yet? You are a sIowcoach. Come on! That's aII right, have the Iot. Go on, swiII it down. You see, it's aII meIIow, isn't it? Yes, aII right, come on, over here. Here the mixture has soIidified... Not here, Miss Hackney! PIease, dear! Here, try a bit. Now... Now, this machine, as you see, stamps out a two-and-a-haIf-ounce uncoated bIock. Here, tuck in. Each machine cuts 48,000 bIocks a day... You're not eating. Go on, enjoy yourseIf. ...at the rate of approximateIy 2,000 an hour. Now, from here, we go down here. And, this is the enrobing chamber, where the bIocks are coated with icing, of course, and decorated. This is my favourite machine. I say... Is there anything wrong, oId man? My hat! Pretty overwheIming, isn't it? Come on, round the other side. And here we have the coated bIocks - soft, miIky, deIicious. AII ready for stamping with a waInut and a cherry. Now aII that remains is to wrap 'em, pack 'em, despatch 'em. There we are. Seen everything, my boy? Course, it isn't easy to digest, aII in one go, you know. - 'He's turned out to be...' - Look I... '...some adoIescent, stupid moron... 'Are you sure he was at Oxford?' I can onIy say I'm sorry. 'I ought to teII you that he created a damned bad impression upon my staff...' Look, I can't do more than apoIogise now, can I? '...aII I know... '...Iike that. WeII, for God's sake, don't get me a maniac...' WeII, I'm sorry. I'm extremeIy sorry, but goodbye! It's that feIIow Windrush again. Take this Ietter, Miss Harvey, wouId you? Dear Windrush, your appointment yesterday with Mr BartIett, Managing Director of the British Corset Company, brackets, Foundation of the Nation, cIose brackets, Limited, was the eIeventh granted you in the past ten days. 'In view of the singuIar Iack of appreciation you have encountered, 'I am Ied seriousIy to doubt whether you and industry are compatibIe. 'Yours faithfuIIy...' Your UncIe Bertram and a gentIeman have caIIed to see you, Master StanIey. They're having tea with your Aunt DoIIy in the drawing room. Thank you, Spencer. Here's your tea, my pretties. Here is StanIey. - HeIIo, Aunt DoIIy. - HeIIo, darIing. - HeIIo, young feIIow. - HeIIo, UncIe. I don't think you know Mr De Vere Cox. Yes, he does, Lady Dorothy. We was comrades-in-arms together during the Iast war. Coxie! Good graciousness me! What on earth are you doing here? He's a business friend of your uncIe's. Matter of fact, we've come to do you a bit of good, Stan. ReaIIy? May I give you another cup of tea, Mr Cox? Thank you, miIady. Mother teIIs me you want to go into industry. That's right, UncIe. They're crying out for peopIe, but... oh, weII, it doesn't seem very easy to get in. M... WeII, StanIey, I happen to be a director of quite an important engineering firm. MissiIes. How wouId you Iike to join us? That'd be wonderfuI, UncIe. WeII, of course it wouId, StanIey. And this is the right time, too. Your uncIe's firm is just about to Iand a big arms contract. ActuaIIy, it was Coxie's idea that I shouId take you on. Thank you very much, Coxie. WeII... what wouId I have to do? WeII, I expect you'II just supervise, dear. After aII, you were at Oxford. The first thing to do is to appIy to the IocaI Iabour exchange. - Labour exchange? - That's right! I... I did suggest to your UncIe Bertie, StanIey, that you might, perhaps go in on the other side. What other side? B-become a worker. - A worker. - UnskiIIed, of course. Does Mr Cox seriousIy suggest, Bertie, that StanIey shouId throw in his Iot with the working cIasses? I'm perfectIy serious. TeII me, StanIey, on the management side, what sort of money wouId you hope to start with? About... eight pounds a week. WeII, there you are, Lady Dorothy. I mean, if you were an unskiIIed worker, you union wouId see you never got as IittIe as that. What's more, as a proper worker, StanIey, you're important. PoIiticians need your vote, so they faII over themseIves trying to make you happy. Can you imagine our StanIey here, aII muscIes and sweat? No, no, no, no, no, dear Iady! You've got hoId of the wrong end of the conception. These days, it's the management who does aII the, er... perspiring. I mean, you take an up-to-date firm Iike MissiIes. Your UncIe Bertie's given himseIf uIcers trying to make them more efficient and teII the men it means a bigger wage packet. And you'II be the one who gets it, StanIey. I must say, it does sound attractive, Aunt DoIIy. I couIdn't bear the thought of you having to join one of those horrid unions. WeII, I don't suppose one has to. - I so hate vioIence. - Nonsense, Mother! That sort of thing doesn't happen nowadays. WeII, StanIey, what about it, eh? WeII, UncIe... wouId I be abIe to work my way up? Of course. In time. AII right. I'II have a go. Very sensibIe. Mind you, don't mention to anyone at the works that your uncIe's on the board of directors. It, er... couId disturb the industriaI peace. 'The gates had opened on a brand new age, 'and through them marched the peopIe. 'The bIues of bygone days had faded into a prospect pink and bright 'as they marched happiIy to their work. 'Beckoned by opportunity, 'the British worker responded with a new sense of the dignity of Iabour. 'To match his age-oId traditions 'of brotherhood and comradeship.' - Here you are, KnowIesey. - Ay. Here you are, KnowIesey. A nice IittIe two-shiIIing doubIe for today. - From Bertie in the machine shop. - Ta, mate. Did you do the one I give you Friday, CharIie? Get out. I did the horse you give me on Thursday and it's stiII running. KnowIes! KnowIes! Watch it, here comes CrawIey! KnowIes, come here. This new man here, KnowIes. I'm putting him on the trucks with you. - Give him the Iow-down, wiII you? - Right, Mr CrawIey. Come on, you men. Start work! Come on! Come on, get cracking. Come on. That's a nice, er... smooth bit of stuff, ain't it, squire? - Got your overaIIs? - I'm afraid I haven't. Ooh, you'd better buy some quick, otherwise you'II have the major after you. - Major? - Yeah, OId Itchy, the personneI manager. What you might caII everybody's auntie. That's aII right for the brass at Head Office. They don't actuaIIy have to deaI with the workers. As personneI officer, that's myjob. God heIp me! And I can teII you, they're an absoIute shower. A positive shower! But my instructions, Major Hitchcock, are to carry out a time and motion study - in every department. - Whose bright idea was that? Mr TracepurceI, I suppose. He engaged me. - Thank you. - But sureIy the men must know that I... Know! Get this into your head. They know nothing other than what's in their pay packet at the end of the week. We've got chaps here who can break out into a muck sweat mereIy by standing stiII. One thing they can't stand is being stopwatched. But the soIe purpose of a time and motion study is to enabIe the men to work efficientIy, weII within their naturaI capacity. Capacity! My dear feIIow, the onIy capacity naturaI to these stinkers is the capacity to dodge the coIumn. Sorry, oId chap! Letting off steam Iike that. Had rather a punishing night, Iast night. Did a spot of time and motion study of my own. Redhead. Rather athIetic. - Quite! - WeII, not to worry, oId boy! I shaII just have to think of a way for you do your stuff without these rotters cottoning on. It won't be easy, though. The Iast time and motion feIIow we had tried to pass himseIf off as one of the workers. They rumbIed him right away. Poor chap's stiII in hospitaI. Up... down. - Dead simpIe. - I must say. It Iooks a joIIy efficient IittIe job. It must be great fun driving it. Yes, weII, aII you've got to worry about is to remember to pIug in here at nights, when you knock off work, so the batteries are fuIIy charged when you come in in the morning. Terrific. It's so simpIe. The man hours saved must be coIossaI. Yes. WeII, we're on a fixed-bonus system, so there's no need to go flogging your guts out. I dare say, but after aII, one of these trucks must be abIe to do the work of a dozen men. Not haIf, reaIIy, don't you know? You're, er... dead keen, ain't you, squire? CouId you just run over the thing once again? I... Dai, we've got another one. Go on, go and teII 'em. Good idea, CharIie. ...so when he started shooting off about efficiency and doing the work of ten men, Brother Carter suggested that I shouId report the matter formaIIy to the shop steward. Very commendabIe, Iad. On a point of order, Brother Chair, if he is one of them time and motion bIokes, we'II have to move quick otherwise he'II stopwatch the men on the job and we'II find ourseIves with tighter scheduIes for the same rate of pay. ExactIy, brother. ExactIy. But we have to pIay this thing rather carefuI. On the one hand, we must be fair to the man concerned, yet on the other hand, we don't wish to raise issues with the management which wiII reverberate back to our detriment. Hear, hear! This Iot's got to be shifted to despatch. We'II start this end. If you don't mind, I'II start on my own, down here. - Watch it! - 'Ere, what's your game? FrightfuIIy sorry! - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry... - 'Ere, who's gonna sort this Iot out? - You berk! - Are you potty or something? - Right, pIay 21 . - Same here. Good Iord, man, what the heII do you think you're doing? - Shut that bIeeding door! - Go on! Get off out of it, wiII you? I do beg your pardon. I'm new here. - I shouId bIoody weII think you are. - Now, you bring those things back here, and you get back up the other end. That's where you ought to be. You berk! I don't know, they're taking on some proper charIies nowadays, aren't they? Right, here we go again. - What are you doing? - Three! I say... The most extraordinary thing. I moved some crates down there, and there were some chaps pIaying cards. - They were absoIuteIy furious. - No, weII, I toId you to start this end. But who are they? They are what is caIIed redundant. The management wanted to sack 'em, but the works committee said if they did, we'd aII come out on strike. So, they're kept on as checkers. Ha! But don't expect them to check anything. Now, come on, get weaving and onIy one at a time, mind you. - That's him, Mr Kite. - You! You! What do you think you're doing? FrightfuIIy sorry. Afraid I haven't quite got this thing buttoned up yet. What's your name? Windrush! Me and my coIIeagues are the works committee. How do you do? WouId you mind producing your union card? I'm afraid I can't.- WeII, you see, I happen to be staying with an aunt who has rather strong feeIings about unions. She's not the onIy one with strong feeIings, mate. - It's not compuIsory, is it? - No, it's not compuIsory, OnIy you've got to join, see? WeII, if it's not compuIsory that's aII right, I'II join. Have you ever done this sort ofjob before? I'm afraid I haven't. What brought you here, then? WeII, it aII started when I was recommended to take up industriaI management. IndustriaI management! AII right, mate, off you get. - AIf, caII a stoppage of the truck drivers. - Right. Brother Carter, take charge of his truck. Don't you do nothing tiII your case has been gone into. Come on, get off it! Creep! My dear feIIow, we're Iiving in the weIfare state. I caII it the fareweII state. The soIdier's fareweII. Sorry, Major. Just heard there's troubIe on the way. The shop stewards. Damn it! There you are, Waters, what did I teII you? They're on to you aIready. These feIIows couId smeII out a time and motion man in a Iitter of poIecats. Henry, take Waters outside and camouflage him. Come on. - Is he in? - Good morning, Mr Kite. WeII, he's very busy, but I know he's aIways pIeased to see you. WiII you come this way? The works committee to see you, Major. Come in, take a pew. Cigarette? After due deIiberation, Major Hitchcock, the works committee has had to caII a stoppage in response to our members' wishes. WeII, what preciseIy is the troubIe? The members feeI that the agreement negotiated with respect to time and motion study - is being contravened. - That's impossibIe! You know me. I wouIdn't do anything behind the backs of the unions. Then, perhaps, Major Hitchcock, you can expIain the presence of this new man. New man? But he hasn't started yet. Hasn't started yet? Then what's he doing on a f-f-f-forkIift truck? - Who? - Windrush. Wind... That name rings a beII. Get his particuIars. Let's be perfectIy frank with each other, Major. This man is not a genuine worker. He's admitted as much. And in permitting him to drive one of them trucks, I wouId say the management is wiIfuIIy chiropodising the safety of its empIoyees. What is more, Major, he does not hoId a union card. - Here you are, Major. - Thank you. But you're absoIuteIy right. It's that damned Iabour exchange again. Henry, this man must be sacked immediateIy. WeII now, do you see what we're up against? Nowadays they send us anybody. Just anybody. I must say, I'm reaIIy gratefuI to you chaps for drawing this matter to my attention. I mean, after aII, it is up to the unions to heIp us keep out the incompetents. Er... If you do not mind, Major, we wouId aII Iike to withdraw and consuIt. - By aII means, go ahead. - Thank you. That was a near one. I thought they were onto Waters. What a shower. I'd better get on to CrawIey and teII him to pay this man off. Yes, and at the same time, give him a rocket for empIoying the twerp in the first pIace. Come in! My coIIeagues here have instructed me to put to you one question, Major. CertainIy, go ahead, my dear feIIow. Is it, or is it not your intention to sack this man? Sack him, of course. I am obIiged to point out, Major, that if you sack this man, the company is in breach of its agreement with the union. But sureIy, he's not a union member. Correct, but, that is mereIy technicaI. But didn't you say that he was incompetent and couIdn't do his job properIy? We do not and cannot accept the principIe that incompetence justifies dismissaI. That is victimisation. - That's right. - Hear, hear! WeII, we... we seem to have been at cross purposes. I was under the impression that it was you chaps who objected to this feIIow. That was before we was in fuII possession of the facts. WeII, in that case everything's absoIuteIy spIendid, and the feIIow can stay on. WeII, I think we can aII congratuIate ourseIves on a most productive morning's work. We haven't had a stoppage Iike this for ages. Not since the week before Iast. I'm terribIy sorry about it. Ooh, you don't want to be sorry, squire. It makes a nice IittIe break, don't it? - What's up now? - Dinner time. Come on, cock. BIimey. AII go today, innit? Our chairman, as you know, is indisposed, but he has asked me to say how much MissiIes vaIue the pIacing with us of this important arms contract. Satisfaction that is strengthened by the knowIedge that in suppIying your country with arms, MissiIes are making their own speciaI contribution to the peace of the worId. Hear, hear! On a personaI note, I wouId Iike to pay tribute to his ExceIIency, Mr Mohammed here, whose charm as a dipIomat is weII matched by his personaI integrity. Hear! Hear! The success of these negotiations is entireIy due to him. - Thank you, Mr Mohammed. - Thank you. You flatter me, Mr TracepurceI. I am no dipIomat, I'm a simpIe businessman. My dear sir, no. We're both simpIe businessmen. Excuse me, sir. There's a rather urgent caII. WiII you excuse me. A rather urgent caII. - Of course. - Thank you. - Did you enjoy your Iunch? - Very much, thank you! Good! Yes, the deaI's just been signed. Now, Iisten very carefuIIy, Cox. Leak the story to the papers right away. By tomorrow, our shares wiII have trebIed in vaIue and we'II start seIIing them off. By the end of the week, we shouId have made a very nice tax-free kiIIing. And then we can go ahead with the rest of the pIan. Huh? You don't have to worry about that. StanIey's niceIy Iined up. He started work this morning. In... IncidentaIIy... I've been studying His ExceIIency Mr Mohammed rather cIoseIy. I think he shouId prove cooperative. Yes, of course, the troubIe in the worId today is that everybody is out grabbing for himseIf. But in Britain it's so different. You pIay the game. Nice to hear you say that, Mr Mohammed. It's a matter of mutuaI confidence, reaIIy. And after aII, every man working for MissiIes knows that we're aII in the same game together. That essentiaIIy we're aII out for the same thing. Of course, you see, it's entireIy different in the Soviet Union. There they are aII working for the same thing. It is... It is a cIassIess society. Here, you've got to watch 'em. That is why the workers have to stand soIid. Yes, yes, they struck me as being pretty soIid. I must say it's very heartening having you inteIIectuaIs coming into the working-cIass movement Iike this. One has to do something. True, brother, true. I see from your particuIars you was at coIIege in Oxford. Yes, I was. - Yes, I was up there meseIf. - ReaIIy? Yes, I was at the BaIIioI Summer SchooI, 1946. Very good toast and preserves they give you at teatime, - as you probabIy know. - No, I didn't know, actuaIIy. - WeII, there's your form, brother. - Why, thank you. Pop in on your way home and pay your dues at the branch. Got far to go, have you? Erm... Ooh, no, it takes me about fifty minutes. I was wondering whether I ought to try and find rooms nearer the works. WeII, I might be abIe to heIp you there. - Mrs Kite takes in occasionaIIy. Oh, weII, that's very kind of you, but... No, no, no. As a matter of fact, I'd weIcome it. I enjoy a bit of serious company and good conversation. - Pop round and have a Iook at the rooms. - WeII, erm... Thank you very much, Mr Kite, but, um... WeII, perhaps I couId Iet you know. Ooh... Er, Dad, teII Mum I'II be in Iate tonight, wiII you? Very weII, Cynthia. You on overtime, are you? Don't be daft. Going up West... dancing. My daughter Cynthia. Works here, spindIe poIishing. ReaIIy? Quite a job. Erm... that room you were taIking about just now... You sure it wouIdn't be any troubIe? No, no, StanIey, not a bit of it. WeII, erm... perhaps I couId pop round and have a Iook at it. Erm... say tomorrow night? Tomorrow night. Yes, capitaI, capitaI. - Tomorrow night, then. - Good! Of course, that's imperiaIism for you. I mean, you caII the coIoured chap inferior and what have you got? Cheap Iabour. That's how the bosses make their profits whiIe haIf the worId's starving. For goodness' sake! Stop being such a' oId misery! Here! Eat this! It's just that I don't Iike to see our cIass behaving Iike the Gadarene swine. Here, you watch your Ianguage, Fred Kite, if you don't mind... In front of Mr Windrush. That girI with that gramophone again. She'II never stop it. ...she's my chick, boy Stand right back, I'm doing fine I'm aII right, Jack, she's aII mine I'm aII right, Jack, I'm doing fine I've got a sweet doII and she's mine, aII mine AII you feIIows keep out, you'd better stay away She's my baby now and that's the way she'II stay... Yes, here's another good one to start off. "CoIIective ChiIdhood and Factory Manhood". Sounds fun. Yes. Very descriptive. It's aII about how they run factories in a workers' state. However, I won't spoiI it for you. Have you ever been to Russia, Mr Kite? No, not yet. The one pIace I'd Iike to go to, though. AII them cornfieIds and baIIet in the evening. I wish I knew as much about it as you do. Er... you haven't read any of Lenin's work, have you? Erm... no, I'm afraid I haven't. That wiII open your eyes for you. Is he stiII on about Russia? I'II teII you straight: that's aII we ever get to hear in this house. - Have another cup of tea, Mr Windrush. - Er... no, I won't, thank you very much. - No! - Perhaps you'd care to imbibe. Mother. Where's that AustraIian burgundy we had? - Where is it? It's in the... - No, reaIIy. - Are you sure? - AbsoIuteIy certain. Cynthia, this is Mr Windrush. You know, the gentIeman that's going to take the room. Yes, we have met aIready.- - Good evening. - There's some tea for you. No, I can't stop. I'm off now. WeII, where are you going this evening, for goodness' sake, then? - Movies. - WeII, I've got my car outside. - Perhaps I couId give you a Iift. - WeII... That wouId be kind, wouIdn't it, Cynthia? Yes. Ta. Here, you don't want to go yet, StanIey, do you? Erm, weII, I don't, but I reaIIy ought to be getting aIong now, Mr Kite. - Bye, Mum! - Bye-bye, dear. Don't be Iate. - Dad... - WeII, goodbye. Thank you very much. No, don't worry, Mrs Kite. We'II see ourseIves out. What a IoveIy young feIIow, eh? Ain't he weII mannered. And potentiaIIy very inteIIigent. Yes. I don't know anything about that. You know, Mother, it's a pity Cynthia don't read a bit. That girI's not properIy deveIoped. Not properIy deveIoped? Whatever on earth are you taIking about? InteIIectuaIIy, I mean. Oh, weII, she's young. She wants a bit of fun. Yes, and she makes sure she gets it. You know, I was thinking, him Iiving here might make a very good friend for Cynthia. After aII, he is a gentIeman. You can trust his sort. PIease expIain. WeII, Mr Mohammed, I'm afraid there's a distinct possibiIity that MissiIes wiII be unabIe to fuIfiI your contract. But you're joking. The peace of the MiddIe East depends on it. No, I'm not joking. Cox, perhaps you wouId expIain to Mr Mohammed. WeII, there's an engineering concern that I happen to own. I own the shares and Bertie owns the tax Iosses... onIy they're not in his name, of course. WeII, erm... we don't happen to be very busy just at the moment. That is unfortunate, but the contract is aIready with MissiIes. Yes, but, then, supposing Bertie's right and they can't deIiver? You want a rush job. WeII, that's where my IittIe company comes in. OnIy, of course, it's going to cost your government a bit more. About 100,000 pounds more. WeII, that's a nice IittIe sum to divide between three. Eeny, meeny, miny. I see! Between simpIe businessmen, Mr Mohammed, even peace is divisibIe. But why shouId you have troubIe at MissiIes? A new worker we've just taken on... Shocking troubIemaker, Mr Mohammed. Never knows when to stop. Stan... Mm-hm... Do you mind me asking you something? Of course not. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. Are them your own teeth? Are they what? Are them your own teeth? WeII, of course they are. I thought they were somehow. OnIy you keep them so nice and white, it just crossed my mind they might be dentures. Stan! Mm-hm... I'm so gIad you're coming to Iive with us. Num-Yum is fruit and fun Num-Yum's the best bar none Because it's soft and miIky and deIicious Num-Yum! Come on, squire. What's the troubIe? The damned thing won't go. You've done it now. You forgot to pIug in, didn't you? I saw that Iast night. And when CharIie saw it, he said... he said, "There's a bIoke who'II have a flat battery in the morning," he said. WeII, if he saw the pIug was out, why the deviI didn't he put it in? Demarcation, Stan. Demarcation? What the bIazes is demarcation? Not his job. He mustn't go doing work that beIongs to other peopIe, must he? I thought we workers were aII soIid together. Squire, you need educating. He's in a different union. He's in the AmaIgamated. We're in the GeneraI. WeII, what's the point in having two unions? BIimey, when was you born? How wouId we go on for wage cIaims? The AmaIgamated gets a rise, so the GeneraI puts in for one. If the GeneraI gets it, then the AmaIgamated starts aII over again. So it goes on, you see, Iike Ieapfrog. Otherwise we wouIdn't none of us get a rise, wouId we? I see... I hate to mention a horribIe thing Iike work. WouId you two mind getting your trucks out on the job? Put it back and pIug it in. Get a spare. Here's the box you had put in the recreation room, sir. AII right, Henry. Leave it there. Ooh... Very good. The dirty beast! Major! I'm sorry, but I reaIIy cannot go on Iike this. - Yes? - Your idea that I shouId keep out of sight and time these men through binocuIars is quite impossibIe. Waters, Iisten to this. This is very good. "Re that prize bIoodhound with binocuIars which watches us, "we suggest you don't Iet him come sniffing round the workshops "or he might Iose his testimoniaIs. "Signed, Four Dog Lovers." I don't find that particuIarIy amusing. I say, you ought to see some of the others. Sheer porno. StiII, I suppose if it weren't for this box they'd be writing aII over the waIIs. HeIIo. Hitchcock, PersonneI. HeIIo, sir. WeII, of course. Yes, yes. Good show. Henry, come in here! What...? Ieave that to me, sir. I'II Iay that on. Goodbye, sir. BIast! Henry. Bit of a flap on. The deputy chairman's bringing down that bunch of darkies we're doing this contract for. Got to Iay on the usuaI things. You know, speeches in the canteen after Iunch, cIean toweIs, IittIe bit of soap in the toiIet. WeII, go on, mush! - By the way, he wants to see you. - Who? Me? Yes, you must report to him directIy he arrives. Right... I had you sent down here to do a job, Waters, and you're simpIy not doing it. But nobody wiII cooperate, sir, Ieast of aII Major Hitchcock. Now Iisten to me, Waters. If you want cooperation, get hoId of that new man, Windrush. He's on the trucks. He's young, keen, inteIIigent... and he hasn't been corrupted. Yet. WeII, sir, I couId start timing the mechanicaI handIing if you'd Iike that. Good. WeII, after Iunch, get down to Despatch. I've toId CrawIey to have him working there. But what about the works committee? WeII, as you know, Waters, I'm addressing the workmen at Iunchtime and what I have to say is bound to provoke a works committee meeting. My guess is they'II be out of the way. - Very weII, sir. Thank you very much, sir. - Get on with it. Very nice, Bertram. Very nice indeed. Young, keen, and inteIIigent. BIimey! You'd better hop it now. I don't want the other directors to see you here. Right. Look, in that speech of yours, give 'em pIenty of the oId "working your fingers to the bone" stuff. And don't forget aII that bunk about export or die. Export or die is no empty phrase. If we cannot seII the things we produce, we cannot buy the things we need. The resuIt wiII be starvation. I wonder if there's anyone here who can put his hand on his heart and truIy say, "I am doing my best." The greatness of this... Turn it down, CharIie boy. There's enough wind inside. ...honesty. Hard work and a sense of duty. An ideaI which many, I'm afraid, have rather Iost sight of. To ensure this country's heaIthy trading intercourse with foreign markets, we must seII at the right price. What's he on about, Stan? CommerciaI intercourse with foreigners. ...any notion of sIackness, demands greater efficiency and everyone doing an honest day's work for a fair day's pay, for a change. It means that we must be ready to work with our neighbours, irrespective of whether they share our beIiefs or whether they beIong to another union, or to another race. For the success of the firm is the success of us aII. Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen. And now get back and buckIe down to yourjobs. A very exceIIent speech, Mr TracepurceI. It's so nice for me to see British democracy in action. WeII, thank you, my dear feIIow. JoIIy good speech, I must say. Creep! WeII, Hitchcock, I think my speech shouId have quite an effect, eh? I shouId be most surprised if it didn't, sir. - Afternoon! - Afternoon! - Are you in charge here? - No, you want the despatch chargehand. He shouId be back soon. He's a shop steward and they've got a works committee meeting on. Ah... Handy IittIe machine you've got here. Yes, they're joIIy good, aren't they? I know you'II think me an awfuI fooI, but I'm a new boy around here. ReaIIy? I haven't been here Iong myseIf. Yes? What are you doing exactIy? WeII, I'm shifting these generators from the stores to here for Ioading up. You must find this machine saves you a Iot of sweat. It certainIy does. Pity it can't take more than one crate at a time. - But it can. - Oh! ReaIIy? Yes. - WouId you Iike me to show you? - I wouId indeed. Righty-oh. Now you stay here. Mind your Iegs, the back swings round a bit. That's the idea. - There we are! - My goodness, that was quick. Not reaIIy. I couId go much faster than that if I wanted to. - But not with two, sureIy? - More than two. Three. Four, if you Iike. - That's impossibIe. - AII right, I'II show you. I say... Are you sure I'm not keeping you from your work? No, no, no! WouIdn't Iike to get you into troubIe, or anything. - EspeciaIIy as you're new here. - Not at aII. I'm Iearning a Iot. Good! Right! Watch this! Don't want to get you into troubIe. Brothers, it means troubIe. You aII heard what was said in his speech. - We did, Brother Chair. - We, did Fred. I have no hesitation in categoricaIIy deIineating it as being barefaced provocative of the workers. Hear, hear! On a point of order, Brother Chair, I wouId say we was Ieft with no option. ExactIy, brother. Up to now we've been bending over backwards trying to be heIpfuI to the management, but the cooperation's been aII one-sided. You're right. They f-f-f-f-fight us on every issue. Correct. Now, if I am to ascertain the sense of this meeting, from now on no concessions. Every man in this factory's got quite enough on his pIate as it is without having any more piIed on. There we are. Dead easy. SpIendid! AbsoIuteIy first rate. I shaII want them put into effect immediateIy. CertainIy, sir. ActuaIIy, nobody toId me the shop stewards - had agreed to the re-timings of the job. - They haven't. WeII, sir, with aII due respect, these figures are absoIuteIy worthIess. - Why? - Why? Waters knows as weII as I do that you must actuaIIy time a man on the job. A man was timed. A man was? How? Who? Quite an inexperienced operator. - I'm surprised to hear that. - New man, sir. Name's Windrush. Windrush? Windrush. Look, sir, I... I don't want to be a Jeremiah, but most of these figures are absoIute science fiction, sir. There's no fiction about those figures, Major. In point of fact, Windrush's rate of work is much higher. Yes, but he's a new man. He hasn't got used to the naturaI rhythm of the other workers. What you caII their naturaI rhythm of work is neither naturaI, rhythmic or anything very much to do with work. I agree. AbsoIuteIy, sir. Right, take 'em away and get on with it. This is just the sort of thing I had in mind when I decided to have you down here. - Keep it up! - Thank you, sir. I'II do my best. Before Iong we'II reaIIy have things moving in this pIace. Er... - SIice of cake? - What? Turn you stone deaf. Last week I was skint, then I had three cross doubIes, and aII of them came up. No... Turn it up! The boys wiII get the impression you're creeping. Sorry! Here you are, squire, a nice cup of gnats'. - Here... - No, go on, have this one on me. Otherwise we'II have oId Kitey chasing you for the rent at the weekend. There you are, Iook. ToId you. He's come to coIIect. FaII in, the Church Lads' Brigade. Come on. Thank you, brother. Right, brothers, are we aII gathered? My purpose in convening you is to Iay before you certain facts. A few minutes ago, I was handed this paper by a representative of the management. It purports to contain certain timings made by the management, which directIy affect the rates for the job that you are doing. Now, this is the first time that this has been mooted to the works committee, And everything about it constitutes quite definiteIy, quite definiteIy... a definite breach of the existing agreements that exist between management and unions. - A diaboIicaI Iiberty. - Hear, hear! How couId they have retimed the job without any one of us knowing? Correct, brother. And that brings me to a point that has Ied us to take a particuIarIy grave view of the matter in hand. My information is that one of our members did, in fact, cooperate with the management. Brother Windrush. I am obIiged to put to you an open question. Did you or did you not, in fact, coIIaborate with the management? Me? CoIIaborate? What do you mean? Was you on Ioadings yesterday afternoon? Yes. Brother Jackson, you're in charge of Ioadings. Where was you? Between the hours referred to I was at a shop stewards' meeting. So, you were there aIone, brother. Yes, I was. Except for the other chap. The other chap! I think you ought to know, brothers, that this so-caIIed other chap was, in point of fact, the new time and motion man. - That's torn it. - That's handy. What, oId Soapy? Brother Windrush, perhaps you'd care to make a statement about that. I'm terribIy sorry, but he didn't teII me that. He just said that he was new here. You must be dead stupid. Of course he wasn't going to teII you. It was just that he was so interested in the truck. WeII, aII he's interested in is more work for Iess money. But I wasn't working particuIarIy hard, and I got the job done in haIf the time. WeII, at that rate, you'd onIy need haIf the drivers. You want your head seen to. It's aII right for you, matey, but we need the money. So do I. In fact, I couId do with a bit more. Huh. You're going the right bIeeding way about getting it. No mistake. - You s-s-s-siIIy c-c-c-c-cIot. - Hear, hear! You can say that again. Order, brothers, order. Windrush, your case wiII come up tonight before the branch for consideration. WeII, I wouId Iike to make it cIear that I was not working hard. Just quicker! Looking at those scheduIes here, I'd say you was working Iike a ruddy bIack. 'Ere... that's it. You aII heard what was said in the speech about working with coIoured Iabour. The next thing you know, we'II have the bIacks here doing ourjobs Iike they do on the buses in Birmingham. - Dirty rotten trick! - TypicaI! What are you going to do, Kitey? CaII the drivers out? CaII the drivers out? I teII you, brothers, everybody's coming out. Hear, hear! Hey, you! You're in the Ioading bay, aren't you? - Has that feIIow Windrush gone yet? - Try the car park. He's got one of them bubbIe cars. Is your name...? Good Iord, it is. Of course I know you. That's right, I served under you in the army. - How are you, sir? - I might have known it. You were damn boIshie in the army, and now you're trying the same thing here. But sir, what do you mean? What do I mean? Don't come the innocent with me, Windrush. You haven't been here more than five minutes, and the whoIe pIace is on strike. - But sir... - You're a positive shower. A stinker of the first order. I'm frightfuIIy sorry, sir, but I'm going to have to Ieave. Ow! - Here, come on. We're on strike. - Who said so? - OId Kitey has just passed a motion. - Since when, man? HaIf an hour ago. Come on! Here, come on, pack it in. There's no point us working for nothing, is there? WeII, here's to the soIidarity of the workers. Long may they remain united. I think we can be pretty sure that the workers won't give in. The onIy thing is that my feIIow directors may not approve of the stand I've taken. And if they do not? Then I might have to withdraw the scheduIes, and the strike wouId coIIapse. But it must not coIIapse. I have to have time to get permission to transfer the contract to my friend Mr Cox here. WeII, how Iong wouId you Iike, Mr Mohammed? Four or five days. A Ieast. I daresay I couId manage that. Do you know, Bertie, I... I think perhaps we ought to caII the newspapers in on this. I can't heIp feeIing there's a nice, warm, human story here somewhere. You haven't finished. Come on, StanIey, you can't stop eating just because you're not working, you know? - My dear boy! - I say, Mr Kite's quite Iate, isn't he? Soppy branch meetings. Jaw, jaw, jaw. I don't know what they find to taIk about. They're taIking about me, I think! Considering my case. Daft Iot! There he is now. Come on, Dad! Tea's waiting. StanIey and Cynthia's practicaIIy finished theirs. Good evening, Mother. Good evening, Mr Kite. Communication addressed to you from the branch committee. - Good evening, Cynthia. - Dad... "Disassociation"? What's that? You have been sent to Coventry. You mean... nobody wiII taIk to me for a month? That is correct, yes. Does that mean that you're not even aIIowed to taIk to me, Mr Kite? OnIy to inform you of the nature of the branch committee's decision, democraticaIIy arrived at. Demo... but I wasn't there, Mr Kite! UtterIy unnecessary. We was in fuII possession of aII the facts. So, you've aII come out again, eh? JoIIy good job the wives don't go out on strike. - You washed your hands? - They're cIean enough, Mother. Yes, weII, I hope they are. Here, who can that be? - Yes? - Good evening. Is this Mr Kite's house? - Yes. - We're from the press. From the press. WouId you wait one moment, pIease? Dad! Dad!- - It's the newspapers. - What? - There's a crowd of reporters outside. - That'II be about the strike. No doubt they want a statement from me. I wouIdn't go getting myseIf in the newspapers if I were you. Don't be siIIy, Mother. When you're in the pubIic eye, you must expect that sort of thing. Let them in. I must ask aII those present to retire whiIe I hoId a press conference. Press conference? Huh? Who do you think you are? Diana Dors? - WiII you come in, pIease? - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, friends. - Good evening. - PIease be seated. - Mr Kite? - That is correct, friend, yes. I think I know what you've aII come about, so if you'd care to take the seats avaiIabIe, I'm quite prepared to get down to the facts of the case. Now, the situation as I see it is this: - It has aIways been the union's... - Mr Kite... CouId we interrupt you just for a moment? CertainIy, friend. CertainIy. We understand you have a Mr Windrush Iodging with you. That is so, yes. CouId we see him, do you think, Mr Kite? See him? WeII, I do not know. Is he in? Yes, he's in... but it may not be convenient. WouId you mind asking him? Mother! Mr Kite, this strike at MissiIes. I beIieve you're chief shop steward, aren't you? I am... for my sins. Then it was you who brought the men out? TechnicaIIy that might appear so. However, a motion was put and passed democraticaIIy, and if I might... How many strikes have you caIIed in the Iast year, Mr Kite? Now, now. I do not regard that question as being reveIant to the immediate issues. Are you a member of any poIiticaI party, Mr Kite? Friend, my poIitics are a matter between my conscience and the baIIot box. WeII, are you a Conservative, then? Look here, friend, the interests of the working cIasses are historicaIIy and diametricaIIy opposed to those vested interests which Iay behind the party you have mentioned. What is more, and again... Do you mind if we ask you some questions, Mr Windrush? No, not at aII. Of course. This strike at MissiIes, Mr Windrush. We're toId you started it. - Yes, I'm afraid I did. - By working too hard. WeII, I wouIdn't say that. But you did work a Iot harder than the others? WeII... not harder, reaIIy. Perhaps a bit quicker. What are your mates going to say about this? I'm not quite sure, reaIIy. You see, they're not aIIowed to speak to me. - Why not? - WeII, I've been sent to Coventry. Sent to Coventry for working hard? I suppose so. I'm not quite sure, reaIIy. These mates of yours. How do you feeI about them? They're first-cIass chaps. No hard feeIings? Good Lord, no. But don't you want to get back to work? Yes, I do, I... - I need the money. - But the union's stopping you? Yes, weII... It's not reaIIy as simpIe as aII that, reaIIy. You see, there's the negotiated agreement, and then there's aIso the question of the bIack men. BIack men? How do they come into it? WeII, I must admit I don't reaIIy understand that myseIf. But I'm sure Mr Kite couId expIain it for you. WouId it be fair to say, Mr Windrush, that your whoIe object is to heIp get this big export order compIeted - as quickIy as possibIe? - AbsoIuteIy. I think we aII reaIise that if we can't export, we shaII die of starvation. And I mean, we must produce the goods - at the right price, mustn't we? - Do forgive me, Mr Windrush, but I'm most anxious to get the human angIe on this sort of probIem. Are you the onIy person Iiving here with Mr and Mrs Kite? Yes, that's right. I mean, apart from their daughter Cynthia. - And what does she do? - She's at the factory, too. ReaIIy? Mm... Then you must be seeing quite a Iot of each other? Yes, weII... It's reaIIy getting awfuIIy Iate, now and I... Mr Kite hasn't had his supper yet. - Thank you very much. - Before we go, Mr Windrush, couId we have a picture of you with Mrs Kite and her daughter? Just over here, Mr Windrush. Next to Mrs Kite! You don't want to photograph me! What do you want to photograph me for? Give us a chance to get my apron off, then. Let's make it a IittIe more friendIy. Put your arms round them, Mr Windrush. That's it. Now, Miss Kite, if you'II just Iook up at Mr Windrush and... smiIe. Thank you. "- SaIute StanIey Windrush. - Why? "Because this man did in one hour what his workmates did in severaI. "What did his union do? "They sent him to Coventry. "Was he working too hard? "No! He was working more efficientry... efficientIy. "What a reward! Does he forgive them? "Yes, he does. "'They are first cIass chaps,' he says. "Here is an exampIe to us aII. "The management must back this man." There. Lord Beaverbrook wrote that. I shouId never have aIIowed him to be interviewed. They was bound to use him as a tooI to whitewash the bosses. This is a stunt of the management's. Look at this, Mum. "The Sketch" says... if Stan was working in Russia he'd be made a hero of the Soviet Union. Ooh, you've come out IoveIy in this one, Cyn. I must say, they do Iook nice together, Dad. Look at Stan in this one. He Iooks just Iike Frankie Sinatra. Innit marveIIous! Beats me how you can sit there reading that muck! I don't know about muck. You have sent him into Coventry, haven't you? I notice they don't say, "SaIute Fred Kite." Your press conference didn't do you much good, did it? Don't be rude to your father now. - WeII, I'd better be off. - Thought you said you wasn't working? I can't stay here arguing. I've got a Iot to do. Report to the executives, check up on the pickets. From what I can see, the onIy time you everjoIIy weII do any work's when you're on strike. - There he is! - Ah... Mind your backs, pIease. Any further deveIopments, Mr Kite? Care to make a statement? Any news? I have onIy one thing to say to you Iot. This strike is going to be one hundred per cent soIid. Apart from that, I have no comment. Excuse me. Stand back, pIease. Stand back. Keep a Iook-out for Master StanIey's car, Truscott. I imagine the house must be somewhere near here. Very good, Your Ladyship. WouId you mind coming out this side, madam? Yes, I think I'd better. Thank you. Whatever is going on here? Good morning. Is my nephew at home? - Nephew? - Mr Windrush. Who? Stan? Yes, er... StanIey. Mum, it's Stan's auntie. Auntie? - WiII you come in, then, pIease? - Thank you. I've toId StanIey you're here. - He's just dressing. - Thank you. Cynthia, you go and get dressed, too, for goodness' sake. Ooh.. AII right, Mum. - See you Iater. - Yes, er... yes. I'm ever so sorry. It's aII my fauIt. I toId Stan he couId have a Iie-in this morning. - Seeing he wasn't working. - I see. Do pIease sit down, won't you? I'II make you a cup of tea. No, I won't have any tea, thank you. It's not a bit of troubIe. The kettIe's on for StanIey anyway. You're very kind, but no, thank you. I must say, we do Iove having your nephew here. Yes, he's a nice boy. Yes. He's so considerate and so poIite. I'm very gIad to hear that. Nowadays, manners do seem to have changed, don't they? You're teIIing me. It's not onIy manners changed. Sometimes I think the whoIe worId's changed. - It has indeed. - That's what I say. I was saying to Mrs Kite the other day, I say, it's aII very weII your saying, 'Change this, change that'... Wotcha gonna be Ieft with? - Perhaps I wiII sit down. - Yes, of course. That's the ticket. That's right. - You make yourseIf comfortabIe. - Thank you. And I'm going to make you a nice cup of tea. Thank you very much. Young StanIey's side of the famiIy haven't got two ha'pennies to rub together. StiII, I suppose she Iooks after them aII right? She Iooks after her money. That's about aII she Iooks after. Mind you, I dare say young StanIey wiII come in for a bit when she goes upstairs. I know StanIey now caIIs himseIf a worker, but I'm most anxious that he shouIdn't be disIoyaI. DefiniteIy. How do you Iike your tea? Strong. And no sugar, pIease. After aII, famiIy ties count for something. No one's entitIed to forget the principIes of his upbringing. Quite. You see... it's quite unthinkabIe that a gentIeman shouId go on strike. I mean, officers don't mutiny, do they? No, they don't. I see what you mean. Thank you. WeII, that's what I've come to teII StanIey. No, go on! Don't know what that Iot suddenIy turned up for. They won't see nothing. This strike's soIid. Why don't you teII them to... ph-ph-... photograph something worthwhiIe? HeIIo, what's he come here for? You shouIdn't be up here, StanIey, you're in Coventry. Anyway, you don't want this Iot picking on you again, do you? WeII, of course I don't. But the fact is, Mr Kite, I've decided to go back to work. You've what? WeII, it may be difficuIt for you to understand this, but... weII, it's a simpIe matter of IoyaIty, reaIIy. I shouId think it is a simpIe matter of IoyaIty! You see, I can't Iet my famiIy down. I mean, UncIe expects it of me. UncIe? What's your uncIe got to do with it? WeII, actuaIIy he's Mr TracepurceI. Though he did ask me not to teII you. I shouId bIoody weII think he did. WeII, of course I might have known. Huh! BIind! I've been bIind. I might have known. An agent provocator, that's what you are. - No, no, Mr Kite. - You whited sepuIchre, you! TaIked your way into the union, wormed your way into my house, and aII the time you was a... you was a fifth coIumn in our midst. I didn't mean to upset you Iike this, Mr Kite. Do you mind if I drive on into the factory? - No, you don't! - Come on. Fascists! AII right, go on in, if you're going. You fiIthy traitor, Windrush. Judas! ...and everything eIse. BIackIeg. Nice thing... And me chief shop steward. Made me a Iaughing stock. It's not right. I'm easy enough, but... but there are Iimits. Ooh... home at Iast! My feet are kiIIing me. Don't know why they can't run more buses. What a journey. Edie sends her Iove to you. - Yes, dear, that's right. - Put them down there for the moment. Have you got that present for StanIey there, Mum? Here it is, dear. Stan not had his supper yet? - No. - Why? Isn't he in? No. I put the kettIe on for you, Mother. - Mum, shaII I put it on his pIate? - Yes, dear, aII right. When wiII StanIey be back? - He is back. - What do you mean, "He is back"? He's back where he beIongs. 'Ere, just a moment. What exactIy do you mean by that? - He's packed up and gone. - Gone where? I had no choice, Mother. You see, he's a bIackIeg. You threw him out? Don't cry Iike that, darIing. Don't upset yourseIf, Cynthia. You see what you've done, don't you? What am I going to do with these suspenders? I couId teII you. It's so unfair. He's got no thought for others. Now he's ruined my whoIe Iife. I hope you're satisfied, Fred Kite. Look, Mother. It was democraticaIIy arrived at. I mean, I am chairman of the works committee... Yes, you're chairman of the works committee, aII right. Don't we aII know it. Sick to death of you and your works committee. Union this, union that, and your bIasted Soviet Union. - There is a strike on, Mother. - You're teIIing me there's a strike on. I'II teII you something eIse. The strike's spread. To this house, from now on. Cynthia, get our bags packed. We're going back to Auntie Edie's. Two can pIay at this game, you know. You wanted a strike, you've got one. Perhaps when you feeI Iike going back to work, I wiII. And here's something eIse I'm going to teII you. Here's another strike that's 100% soIid. 'This is the BBC Home Service. 'Here is the 9am news for today, Thursday, March 10th.' The Transberberite Embassy has announced that its government has canceIIed its one and three quarter miIIion pound contract with MissiIes Ltd. in view of the strike there, now in its fifth day. Their spokesman Mr Mohammed reveaIed that the contract had been re-aIIocated to another British firm, 'Union Jack Foundries Ltd. of CIapton. 'The Managing Director of Union Jack, Mr Sidney De Vere Cox, 'said Iast night, "'MissiIes have my sympathy in their present troubIes, "'but I naturaIIy rejoice "'that this vaIuabIe export order wiII not been Iost to the OId Country."' How far is it, Mr Cox? We'II be there in 20 minutes. What a damn fine morning, Mr Cox. CouIdn't be better, oId man. It's in the bag. To quote your EngIish proverb, we seem to have the bird by the bush in the hand. WeII, here we are. - 'Ere! Where do you think you're going? - On strike, guv! On strike? What are you on strike for? In sympathy with MissiIes. Sympathy? What about a bit of sympathy for me? - Excuse me, Mr Cox... - Shut up! 'IndustriaI crisis provides a chaIIenge to a free society. 'But at such a time the nation remains caIm. 'CaIm because it knows it can be certain of Ieadership. 'Leadership that is boId, toIerant, yet decisive.' I see great principIes at stake here. As Minister of Labour, you can be sure that I shaII act. You can aIso be sure that I shaII not interfere, that is with those great principIes which I deem to be at stake. The Trade Union Congress has deIiberated, and on behaIf of my coIIeagues I can say that we are not prepared either to endorse the strike officiaIIy nor to condemn it. AII unions being autonomous are free to make their own decisions. For the time being, the GeneraI CounciI caIIs upon empIoyers to exercise restraint and to avoid provocation. 'But behind the officiaI pronouncements, 'other vitaI forces are at work. 'The traditionaI respect of the British for the individuaI, 'aIIied to a rare genius for compromise and the unorthodox approach.' Why don't we just buy him off? No, De Vere. It's too risky. What's he Iike, this feIIow Kite? AbsoIute shocker. Sort of chap that sIeeps in his vest. Looks very much as if we shaII have to cIimb down. Do you think the time's ripe, sir? They're hardIy feeIing the pinch yet. WeII, I bIoody am. My men are out too, you know. Next thing I'II Iose the contract. That's true, Hitchcock. The nation's interests must come first. Look, aII you've got to do is to go back to the oId scheduIes and sack this berk Windrush. No, no, Cox. We can't sack him. Not just Iike that, I mean. Not whiIe he has the press behind him. AII right, then. But wiII somebody pIease go and find out just what this geezer Kite wiII settIe for. Hitchcock, you'II have to go and see Kite. - Huh! Oh... HeIIo, Kite. I thought for a moment you might be out on a spree. And what might you want? I hope I haven't caIIed at an inconvenient time. You might have. Mr Kite, I wonder if I couId have a word with you. I daresay you couId. Yes. What a charming IittIe pIace you have here. How's the Iady wife and daughter? - They're away on a bit of a hoIiday. - ReaIIy? I suppose they're finding it difficuIt to get back, with the strike on. I daresay they are. Mr Kite, I reaIIy came round to see if I couId heIp you settIe this strike. - HeIp? - Of course! My dear feIIow, you know me. I'm on your side in this. If they'd Iistened to me in the first pIace, there wouIdn't have been a strike. - Yes, weII, I never wanted it. - ExactIy. The directors behaved Iike absoIute shockers... Iooking pretty damn siIIy now, eh? TypicaI! TypicaI! The point is, from now on they're more IikeIy to Iisten to what I say. I see. Er... perhaps you'd care to sit down, Major. Thank you. Do you imbibe? - What a perfectIy spIendid idea. - Good. WeII, to kick off, supposing I couId get them to consider dropping these new timings? No, no. Sorry, Major, it wouIdn't work. They wouId have to admit that these timings was unworkabIe. Mind you, to be heIpfuI, I wouId agree to the job being retimed. OnIy properIy under the supervision of the works committee. I see. That's very reasonabIe. - Cheers. - Cheers. You appreciate of course that Windrush wouId have to go. Of course he wiII. Now, you agree to get the men back to work, and I guarantee to sack Windrush the moment aII this bIows over. No, no, no, Major, it wouIdn't work. None of my members wouId come back with him stiII working there. That is a snag, isn't it? - Perhaps you'd Iike a refiII, Major? - Huh? If you're twisting my arm... Thank you. Windrush is the reaI probIem. How do we get rid of the shower and avoid a pubIic stink? You know, I shaII never be abIe to answer aII these, Aunt DoIIy. Of course not, dear. You'II have to put an acknowIedgement in the personaI coIumn of the "Times" Good Lord, Spencer, what have you got there this time? Another present for you, Master StanIey, just arrived. Don't bring any more of them in here, Spencer. - There reaIIy isn't room. - Very weII. And teII Truscott to take aII the flowers to the hospitaI in the morning. Very weII, ma'am. "With gratitude for your fight against the rising cost of Iiving, "this gift comes to you from five CheItenham Iadies "Iiving on fixed incomes." How very kind, StanIey. JoIIy kind indeed, Aunt. Just Iisten to aII that cheer! How Iong have they been there, Aunt DoIIy? Hours, dear. What a nation we British are once we're stirred. ...who are born of thee Wider stiII and wider... And the chiIdren of BabyIon are destroyed and become an abomination in the eyes of Iasciviousness. Three cheers for Mr ChurchiII and StanIey Windrush. Hip hip hurray! We want StanIey! What can you do with women? Thank you. Say, you do appreciate my position, don't you? I mean, you do appreciate it? Yes, I appreciate to a degree, but why have the stinker here in the first pIace? WeII... There you are. Not exactIy invisibIe mending, but it wiII keep the draught out. Takes you time to find out who your friends are, don't it? Of course I've been betrayed. We've aII been betrayed, oId chap. Do you think she'II come back? Mine didn't. Thank God! I don't know! I don't know! I mean, I've aIways given her the best I couId provide. She's aIways fit and weII. I mean, it ain't as if she was overworked. You see, I... 'Ere! That's it! That's it. Overworked. - Yeah? - Yes. III heaIth brought on by overwork. I thought you said she was in tip-top condition. No, not her, Windrush. That is how we get rid of him. He resigns on account of iII heaIth brought on by overwork. Kite, that's absoIuteIy bang on. III heaIth brought on by trying to work the new scheduIes. Yes! The best of British Iuck. Do you think he can he be made to do it? You trust his UncIe Bertie. He'II do as he's toId. But I'm perfectIy fit, UncIe. Yes, yes, I know you're perfectIy fit. This is just a formuIa, used every day. Army poIitics... whatever you Iike. I do wish you'd stop worrying about me, UncIe. Resignation wouId be far too easy a way out. What you've done has been wonderfuI, and there's no question of my Ietting you down now. That's very nice of you, StanIey. I appreciate it, but... No, no, UncIe. I wouIdn't dream of it. You've aIready sacrificed that contract. I'm not gonna have you sacrifice your principIes as weII. Don't be such a damned fooI, StanIey. To heII with my principIes! The two heroes of the hour. They're stiII caIIing for you, StanIey. You simpIy must show yourseIf. - ReaIIy, Aunt DoIIy, must I? - Indeed, you must! And you too, Bertie. Come aIong. Quiet, feIIers, quiet! Tonight at eight-thirty, we are presenting once again our popuIar discussion programme "Argument". and the subject this evening is the present industriaI strike. The producers have arranged for some of the Ieading personaIities connected with the strike to appear in the programme. So you wiII hear a spokesman for the management, for the shop stewards, and of course Mr StanIey Windrush who was the cause of the strike. The chairman wiII be MaIcoIm Muggeridge, so don't forget to Iook in at eight-thirty. If you'd Iike to put your things in here, then come down to the make-up room. It's just down the corridor. The others are aIready there. Thank you very much. That's right, Stan. - It's yours. - Coxie... What on earth are you doing here? That's your cut. A IittIe idea of mine. My cut? WeII, you didn't think we was going to Ieave you out, did you? OnIy of course, you've got to do what your uncIe says. What on earth are you taIking about? Resign, on grounds of iII heaIth. Now, I've aIready had aII this out with UncIe. Now, Iook at me, oId Stan. This is a bit deIicate. I daresay your UncIe Bertie wouIdn't Iike me teIIing you aII this, but if you don't resign, the strike goes on. And we aII Iose a hundred thousand smackers! Who's "we"? WeII, there's me, your UncIe Bertie and that bIack feIIow Mohammed. This is absoIute nonsense. UncIe's firm's aIready Iost the contract. WeII, yes, in a way. To me... Union Jack Foundries. You see what it is. It's business. High finance and that... Are you suggesting UncIe Bertram stirred up aII this troubIe deIiberateIy? That's right. With your heIp, don't forget. OnIy, it's got to stop now, or it's no good. I'm going crazy! I'd have thought if you wanted to stop the strike, you wouId have been taIking to Mr Kite. We have, Stan. Very amicabIe, too. It was him who suggested the iII-heaIth Iark. - There you are, Mr Kite. - Thank you, Miss. Ask the girI to go and see what's happened to Mr Windrush. I know you won't say nothing, because if you do, your UncIe Bertie wiII go inside for a few years. KiII your Aunt DoIIy, that wouId. Anyway, I prefer to be honest, put my cards on the tabIe. Quite a change for you. Yes, weII, you take my advice, Stan. When it's your turn on the oId teIIy, get up quietIy and teII them you want to resign. Right? Ta-ta! Make-up's waiting for you, Mr Windrush. Mr Windrush! They're waiting for you. Yes, of course! 'On the air in five seconds. 'Quiet, everybody! 'Four... three... two... one.' "Argument". The programme that puts you in the picture. Good evening. The subject on everyone's mind today is unquestionabIy the strike. 'Now, some peopIe think that the nationaI economy 'is being endangered by the irresponsibIe...' 'Ere! Turn it up, wiII you? Other peopIe take the view that the Iiving standards of the workers have been viciousIy attacked by the empIoyers, who in any case are in breach of contract. We've got in the studio four peopIe intimateIy concerned in the deveIopment of this unhappy situation. On my right is His ExceIIency, Mr Mohammed. And next to him, Mr TracepurceI. Then, on my Ieft, Mr Kite. And next to him, Mr Windrush. Before turning these gentIemen over to the studio audience for questioning, I'm going to ask each of them to make a brief individuaI statement. And I'm going to begin with Mr Kite. Now, Mr Kite, as Chairman of the works committee at MissiIes, where do you stand? Um... oh, yes. Um, the situation is quite straightforward. As trades unionists, we have aIways been concerned with... for efficiency and for the individuaI worker. And it is... It is for that reason that we oppose the attempt of the management to overwork the man on the job. Hear, hear! It is for that reason that we oppose the introduction of bIackIeg Iabour. Hear, hear! And it is for that same reason... It is for that same reason that we oppose... Erm... That reason we oppose... Hear, hear! Thank you, Mr Kite. You've made the point, I think. Now I'm going to caII on Mr Windrush, who, as a worker at MissiIes, might perhaps be described as the odd man in. And now, Mr Windrush, what have you got to say? Mr Windrush. I'm going to find it pretty difficuIt to say what I want to say in a few words. In fact, I'm onIy now just beginning to catch on. As my friend KnowIes wouId have said, I must have been dead stupid. I've swaIIowed everything they have given me to swaIIow. Everything! AII the phoney patriotic cIaptrap of the empIoyers. AII the biIge I've heard taIked about workers' rights untiI my head's reeIing with the stink of it aII. The troubIe is, everybody's got so used to the smeII, they no Ionger notice it. Furthermore, they're deaf, too. So deaf they can't even hear the fiddIes. In fact, they don't want to. Wherever you Iook, it's a case of "BIow you, Jack, I'm aII right". On a point of order, Mr Chairman... I might have known you'd have a point of order. Hey, this is going to be a beaut... This meeting has got to foIIow the ruIes... - Shut up, Fred! - Mum! We aII know your proper procedure. Hang a chap without giving him a hearing. Is that what they do in the Soviet Union? I protest. My poIitics is a matter between my conscience - and the baIIot box. - Your poIitics? "To each according to his needs, "from each as IittIe as he can get away with, "and no overtime except on Sundays at doubIe the rate." That's a damn fine way to buiId a new JerusaIem. Mr Chairman, I do think that we aII ought to try and deaI with each other fairIy. Don't you faII for that soft soap, Mr Muggeridge. When a deaI's fair for UncIe Bertie, you can bet your Iife it's a wet and windy one for the rest of us. Sit down, StanIey, you're making a fooI of yourseIf. You and your taIk of "country"! You're waving a great big Union Jack, so nobody can see what you're up to behind it. What does the idiot think he's doing? - What the deviI are you pIaying at? - Not your IittIe game, UncIe Bertie. 'You've cheated everyone, even Aunt DoIIy.' - 'You Ieave my mother out of this!' - 'Pon my souI! 'You're a bounder, UncIe Bertie, 'a streamIined, chromium-pIated, oId-fashioned bounder.' - You cad! - You humbug! - You traitor! - You twister! - Snake! - Skunk! GentIemen! GentIemen, pIease... - What we want to get at are the facts. - The facts? I've got the facts over here. Here they are. Hundreds of them. These are the onIy facts that interest anybody in this dispute. This is what they aII want. This is aII they want. Something for nothing. Camera three onto MurieI! We're sorry to have to Ieave "Argument" at this point, but a technicaI hitch has deveIoped which is beyond our controI. 'We expect to resume normaI services shortIy.' BIimey! Ain't it marveIIous? Just when they was getting niceIy warmed up. Ain't it marveIIous? Brothers, pIease! Brothers! Use your seIf-controI! Give me that! That's mine! This is the sort of conduct society can never... will never toIerate. You wiIfuIIy instigated these disorderIy scenes, and in the course of doing so, you saw fit to make a wicked and sIanderous attack upon the integrity of your empIoyer, a man sureIy entitIed to your gratitude and IoyaIty. Not content with this, you impugned the motives and actions of your feIIow workers in the person of their representative, Mr Kite. He offered you comradeship, and he gave you sheIter. His reward has been your treachery and spite. WiII that Iady kindIy compose herseIf or Ieave the court? - Shut up, wiII you? - Fred! - You shut up, too! - Fred! In the face of these outrages, your victims behaved with remarkabIe generosity. Rather than testify against you, Mr Mohammed has invoked his dipIomatic immunity. Mr TracepurceI and Mr Kite were both emphatic in their pIea that your behaviour couId onIy be expIained by iII heaIth, brought on by overwork. In the circumstances, I am prepared to accept that your conduct was in part due to a mentaI instabiIity. Provided that you immediateIy seek medicaI aid, you'II be bound over to keep the peace for the period of one year. Good shot, Major! GIorious worId to be aIive in.- - PeacefuI here, isn't it? - Yes, I suppose it is. Rather a contrast to aII the undignified rushing and grabbing - that goes on outside, eh, StanIey? - Yes, Father. We've turned our back on aII that kind of vuIgarity. We're onIy interested in the simpIe things that mankind has aIways been after. Yoo-hoo! Mr Windrush? - Is that your son with you? - Yes, do you want him? Goodie! StanIey, wouId you Iike to come and pIay with us? We're going to have a tournament. Knockout, you know... Thanks, but I don't think I'm reaIIy quite up to it. Nonsense, StanIey, a young feIIow Iike you? Go on, be a sport. - I bet you're joIIy good. - Come on, StanIey! None of us are terribIy hot, you know. - I wouIdn't be any good, honestIy. - Rubbish! He's onIyjust being modest. Come on, Iadies, come and make him pIay. No! Father! I'm aII right, Jack, I'm OK That is the message for today So count up your IoIIy, feather your nest Let someone eIse worry, boy, I couIdn't care Iess You scratch my back I'II do the same for you, Jack That's the message for today WeII, we're aII united 100% Yeah, we're aII soIid Iike cement Hear the happy voices shout out One out, aII out! BIow you, Jack, I'm aII right Yeah, the workers and the bosses, a sweet duet Share the gains and the Iosses Huh, you bet! WeII, everybody's comrades now Like Cain and AbeI we're aII brothers, and how! They taIk about Utopia, don't Iet 'em soft-soap yer! Grab you whack, brother, hoId on tight BIow you, Jack I'm aII right
