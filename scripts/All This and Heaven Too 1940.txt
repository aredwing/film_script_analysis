And neither will my mother when she comes back. - She's Mademoiselle D. - Well, who's Mademoiselle D? Hurry up. Miss Haines is in. - Our teacher's name is Mademoiselle D? - No. Her name is Desportes. But she was known as Mademoiselle D. Don't you understand? Shh. Girls, be quiet. "Jane Van Buren. Margaret Van Rensula." Did you hear what Emily found out about our new teacher? Everybody's in, Miss Haines. Thank you, Rebecca. This is Rebecca Jay. "Agnes Brevoort. Mary Simpson. Marianna Van Horn. Rose Stanton. Clara Parker and Elizabeth ward. Dor..." Young ladies, you may go to your seats. "Dora Vanderbilt. Emily Schuyler. Louise DeRham, Helen Lexington. Faith DeLancy..." - Give me the paper. - Here. Be careful. "Virginia Knowles." - See the look I gave her? I don't think she'll like it here. You may sit down, young ladies. And now I want to say that it gives me great pleasure... ...to introduce you to your new instructress in French... ...Mademoiselle Henriette Desportes. I'm glad to welcome her to our school. And I trust you'll have the good sense to profit by her teaching. - You may take over. - Thank you. - Good morning, young ladies. Good morning, Miss Haines. Imagine, Emily... ...being involved in such a scandal and teaching in our very class. It's about time... ...we had some excitement in this school. - And in your language: Good morning, young ladies. I've been appointed your teacher. I hope before the end of the year I should have deserved to become your friend. Well, so much for that. Will you turn in your literature books to page one? I will select at random from the roll. Agnes Brevoort. - Yes, mademoiselle? - Will you start reading, please? Dora. Give it to Emily. Yes. Emily. Please, send me the paper. Now Marianna Van Horn will translate. Mademoiselle Van Horn, you will translate, please. I don't know the place. The top of page one. Perhaps Helen Lexington has been paying more attention. I, mademoiselle? - Yes... She'd better never jump on me before the whole class... ...or I'll show her. - Shh! "What would you like to play? George: No. Let us go to the woods... ...to hunt for fraise... " You call them strawberries. They are the strawberries that grow in the woods. How did you find out? Mother's maid kept all the Paris papers and I read them. - Are you sure? - Am I sure? She's the same person and I think it's wicked. Mademoiselle Schuyler. I believe that is your name, Emily Schuyler? Yes, mademoiselle. You have been doing a good deal of talking. - Would you like to ask a question? - Yes, mademoiselle. But I'm not sure you will like to answer it. - Well, come here, will you? Emily. Was there something you would like to know? Could you tell me how to spell "Conciergerie"? I beg your pardon? I'm asking you how to spell "Conciergerie." I think it's the name of a French prison. Why do you want to know? I mean, that particular word? Well, you said yourself we were here to learn. Yes. Of course. C... ...O... ...N... ...C... ...I... ...E- R... And then you might show us how you spell the name Praslin. Emily. Emily, be quiet. And now if you will all excuse me, please. Come in, please. Miss Haines, l... - You? - Yes, it's I. I came to welcome you to your new home. Oh. Then I'm afraid you've come for nothing, Henry. I must leave at once. You must accept my resignation. - What? - They have found out. - I was a fool to think they wouldn't. - What have they found out? I should have told you before I accepted this post dishonorably. I let you take me in as Henriette Desportes... when you're also Henriette Deluzy, the notorious Mademoiselle D. Is that it, my dear? You knew? Naturally when Mr. Field recommended you, he told me everything. We agreed that old scandals might be forgotten in your case. - It was you, Henry? - Miss Haines... ...would you allow me to speak to Mademoiselle Desportes? Certainly. And I hope whatever you decide will be for the best. It isn't any use, Henry. Though you've done me this last kindness, even you must realize it is hopeless. "Conciergerie." That girl asked me how to spell Conciergerie. That child... All that is past. No. It's crossed the ocean and followed me. It's down there in that schoolroom now in the way that girl looked at me. Henry, I have nothing left to fight with anymore. Yes, you have. If you could only see yourself as I know you can be. Proud, looking up with clear eyes, ashamed of nothing. If you can face your conscience, you can face those children. And don't beg for their respect, demand it. If I only had your courage. Please. Please, Henriette. I suppose I owe it to you to try. Mademoiselle Deluzy. This sign will teach her a lesson. - Why do they call her Mademoiselle D? - Her name is Desportes or Deluzy. - I wonder if the duke was as handsome... - Shh. Here she is. The rest of the lesson today will be conducted in English. You may lay aside your books, for it is to be entirely oral. I am going to tell you a true story. Perhaps I am wrong in telling it to you... ...but in a few years you will be women of an age to love and suffer... ...and face difficult problems. So it will not hurt you to learn... ...that life is not always the pretty picture we might wish it to be. If there are any of you who do not wish to hear my story... ...you have my permission to leave now. Very well, then. All I ask is that you give me your whole attention. For most of our story we will be in Paris, in a large and beautiful house... ...which is the residence of the Duc and the Duchesse de Praslin. It is of the governess in this household which I will tell you. On a February morning some years ago, she had not yet arrived in Paris... ...whence she had been summoned for an interview. It was a passenger on a steamer which was making its way... ... across the foggy English Channel from Southampton toward Le Havre. In the bag she carried was a letter of recommendation from her last employer. She could not know into what unexpected adventure the letter would carry her. And even more, how another letter would one day bring her world down in ruins. She only knew that one cycle of her life was past and another beginning. And she looked forward toward the distant, invisible shores of her native country... ... with mingled feelings of hope and apprehension. She was traveling alone. She had learned long since to look after herself... ... and if she was lonely, she hoped that nothing in her manner gave it away. I beg your pardon. Do you mind if I talk to you? Since we seem to be the only ones hardy enough to brave the deck. Please, believe me, I've never gone up to speak to a stranger before. If I've offended you, if you want me to go away, I will. I saw you first on the dock at Southampton. How sad those people were when they said goodbye to you. After five years, it is difficult to part from those you love. I was sad for them, I don't know why. That little girl, how bitterly she wept. That was Nina. I was her governess. And when the gentleman took your hand and wished you happiness... ...the oddest feeling came over me. You were a perfect stranger to me, and yet l... I found myself wishing with all my heart that you would be happy. I suppose you think that's ridiculous. Naturally. And yet it's true that you're not happy now. It's in your face and in your manner. You're unhappy and resigned to it. Well, a person in my position must be content... ...with picking up a few crumbs of happiness from others' tables. - Now I'm sure you'll excuse me. - Oh, please don't go. I know I've been impertinent and rude... ...but I promise I won't probe any further. I will talk about the most innocent generalities. In fact, I'll talk about myself. - I'm an American. - I rather guessed that. From Massachusetts. My name is Field. Henry Field. And there's a "Martyn" in the middle and a "Reverend" that goes in front. You are a minister. Well, I'm not exactly a full-fledged minister yet. I haven't taken a regular pastorate. But my father's a minister and I preached my first sermon... ...when I was 15 in one of his cut-down coats. Just now I'm broadening myself with some travel. I don't suppose broadening will hurt a minister, do you? I'm sorry, but we dock soon. The luggage is being sorted in the lounge. Yes. Thank you. - If you'll excuse me? - But I don't even know your name. Where will I ever find you? Well, I really don't know where I'll be myself. Goodbye, monsieur. You're not thinking of joining this household, mademoiselle? I hope to be the new governess. Hope, you say? Heh. You'd not enter this house of your own free will. - You find that amusing? - Yes, quite amusing. You see, young lady, I'm old Pierre, the handyman. And I not only sweep the courtyard, but I wash the windows and see a good deal. I could tell you things. So many things. - I am expected. - Follow me, mademoiselle. Everyone knows the pleasure you take in humiliating me. I have no wish to humiliate you, Frances. My decision... Isn't every day of my life a humiliation? Theo, I'm your wife. We're both young and yet we live... Frances, in the name of your pride. Come in. Mademoiselle Henriette Desportes. Yes? Madame la Duchesse. I trust I am not too early. Really? What time is it? You asked me for 11, madame, but if I am inconveniencing you... Please make yourself comfortable, mademoiselle. Thank you, Monsieur le Duc. - Allow me. - Thank you. Allow me to express my gratitude for the compliment you've paid... ...in summoning me to discuss your children's education. I sent you my letter of reference yesterday. I hope you found it satisfactory. The reference. Oh, yes, quite so. As I remember, it was excellent. There must, of course, be much more you would wish to know about me. I, for my part, should wish to know more about the children... ...before I could assume such a responsibility. The requirements are about the same as your last position, Mademoiselle Desportes. We want a governess to take full charge of the children's education... ...to supervise their music, drawing and behavior. I'm afraid they'll be quite a handful. We have three girls. They might be a little difficult. You see, they are from 8 to 13. I understand, monsieur. Then there is a boy... ...who was born... ...some years later. Raynald, who is not quite 4. He's a bright little fellow, but his health... Raynald is sensitive like me. For years before he was born I was made unhappy and ill. - He will bear the marks of my suffering. - Frances, please. I think we can bring this interview to a close, Mademoiselle Desportes. In view of your excellent reference... ...a trial of the post is yours if you would like it. Before you commit yourself, monsieur... ...I was expected to provide a letter of guarantee from my grandfather... ...my only living relative. I'm sorry, he has refused it. Isn't that rather strange? Your own grandfather? And furthermore... This is very awkward. If I come here, I shall have to ask you to call me by some other name than Desportes. Am I to understand that your name is not Desportes? My grandfather, the Baron Desportes, received his title from Napoleon. So naturally, he is opposed to my associating myself in a household... ...of such prominent friends of the present king. I must say this is... This is an awkward situation, Mademoiselle... Deluzy. I chose that name to keep my initials intact. So this is what happens when you want to make a change, Theo. We're to take someone in to teach disloyalty to our children? I give you my word, madame... ...I would not allow my political beliefs to affect my teachings of your children. But if... If these things make a difference in your feeling, I will understand. Oh, that must be the children. I had asked Mademoiselle Maillard to bring them by. Does that seem necessary now, Theo? - Good morning, Papa. - Is this our new governess, Papa? - You didn't come to dinner last night. - I finished my lesson... Children, children. Not so much noise. Your poor mother's nerves. - Mademoiselle Maillard. - Yes, monsieur? This is Mademoiselle Deluzy. - Very pleased. - How do you do? - I do hope you're better today. - Come, children, make your curtsies. This long-legged colt is Isabelle, the eldest. Mademoiselle Isabelle. You are already a young lady. And my little Louise. Mademoiselle Louise. What lovely hair for curling. May I curl my hair? Mademoiselle Maillard... Not one of you children has so much as said good morning to your mother. - Good morning, Mother. - Good morning. And where's Berthe? Here I am, mademoiselle. Good heavens, child, don't spill Mama's ink. I'm not spilling, I'm drawing. Well, give that to me. How many times have I told you not to touch the things on Mama's desk? Such a beautiful child. A little headstrong, but very lovable if one can win her over. Raynald. Raynald, come away from there at once. You bad, bad boy to pick Mama's flowers. Just for that you'll stay home tonight. And for supper, no baba. Not one spoonful. Whatever made you do a thing like that? It's for mademoiselle to put on her dress. Oh, that was kind, Raynald, a very kind thought. But you should have asked permission first. Perhaps if you ask her now, she'll let you give it to me. But I picked it for the new mademoiselle... ...because she has pink ribbons in her bonnet. Mademoiselle Maillard, let him give it to her... ...and take them all out of here. As you wish, madame. Come, Raynald. Thank you, Raynald. But since it is your mother's flower, wouldn't it be nicer if you gave it to her? See how pretty it will look in her dress. I'll pretend I'm wearing it here when I go out. All right, Raynald? Yes, mademoiselle. Here, Mama, it's for you. Thank you, Raynald. All right, children, back to the schoolroom. Mademoiselle Maillard, Isabelle, Louise, Berthe, all of you. I'll see you at lunch time. - Don't forget to come to dinner. - You promised to go riding. Quickly, quick. Well, Mademoiselle Deluzy... ...one never knows how a new person will fit into a household... ...but I like your way with children and they seem to like you. Would it be possible for you to report in the morning? It is very kind of you, monsieur. But I feel I could not come at all without madame's approval as well as yours. Oh, it really doesn't concern me one way or the other. Monsieur has taken over the children's education. He knows I was satisfied with Mademoiselle Maillard... ...since she's proved her loyalty and affection. I hope you won't mind if she stays on with me as my personal attendant. Until tomorrow then, mademoiselle. And I hope you will stay with us for a long time. Thank you, monsieur. Mademoiselle Deluzy. Yes, madame? How old are you? Twenty-five, madame. So young. - This way. Don't trouble, monsieur. I will find my way out. - Good day, madame. Good day. Monsieur. Don't leave me, Theo. Oh, how angry you are with me. - I'm late at the palace. - But I must talk to you. I never see you. The king expects me. Does the touch of my hands fill you with aversion? - Really... - It must be aversion... ...since you avoid me, never willingly give me a moment's thought or attention. I have no wish to avoid you, Frances. I would talk to you by the hour if we could do so with calmness and sanity. - But it always ends the same. - Wait, Theo. Wait. Oh, how cruel you are, my darling. Take the children, take them. I care nothing about them, about anyone but you. Theo, if I promise never again... ...to torment you with my anger and mistrust... - You don't know what you're saying. - Theo. Theo. Theo, come back, please. Theo, come back. I beg you. I hate you. I loathe you. You're wicked, wicked, wicked. - Oh, Father Gallard. - Have patience, my child. "And one day, when the little princess was walking in the royal gardens... ...she noticed a lovely pink rose which she could not remember having seen before. As she leaned to smell its fragrance, it suddenly dissolved into thin air. And there in its place stood the fairy godmother. And the fairy godmother spoke to the princess and said: 'My child, you have been kind and good and I have come to reward you. Now I have only one gift to bestow upon you... ...so mark my words well. For once your choice is made, it cannot be changed. It is within my power to give you happiness... ...while you are young, or happiness when you are old. Which shall it be? ' The princess pondered in deep thought. 'It is a hard choice, dear godmother. But if I spend my share of happiness while I am young... ...then I shall have nothing left to look forward to. So let me have my happiness when I am old... ...and may heaven send me patience.' The godmother then embraced her. 'You have made a wise choice. And you will not regret it, dear. Go now with my blessing."' Do you agree that she made the right choice? Papa. - Come. I asked you a question. - When did you come in? Louise, was the princess right to wait until she was old to get her happiness? No, I think she was foolish to wait so long. Couldn't she ask for a little when she was young and a little when she was old? Ha-ha-ha. Berthe shows early signs of diplomacy. But it's not so easy as all that. Is it, mademoiselle? No, it is not so easy as all that, monsieur. Happiness isn't a little cake which we can cut up to fit our appetite. Doesn't mademoiselle read beautifully, Papa? She doesn't read like a mademoiselle, does she? I would say the great Rachel herself could not read better. Oh, Papa. Rachel. Will you take me to see her on stage some day? You'd like to see Rachel, wouldn't you? I would very much. I never have. - But I'm afraid this isn't any time... - Oh, please, Papa. Perhaps. Now I should not be interrupting. It's time for lessons again. Isn't it, mademoiselle? It certainly is. The girls have their history... ...and Raynald is about to retire into a corner with his alphabet and his sniffles. What's this? Sniffles? How did you get the sniffles? Raynald didn't invite them, Papa. - They just came. - Ha-ha-ha. Well, send them away then, the same way mademoiselle is about to send me. Oh, don't go, Papa. Mademoiselle doesn't mind. Why don't you stay as you often do? Unfortunately, the House of Peers is meeting this afternoon. Your father has to make a speech about the advantages of a treaty with Turkey. - A speech? - Let Turkey wait. - May we come and hear you? - Perhaps, if I make a very good speech... ...mademoiselle will allow me to come along on your walk in the park. - What is it, Pierre? - The carriage is ready. Oh, yes. Mademoiselle, I'd like to talk to you. Yes, monsieur. Isabelle, take care of Raynald, will you? Louise, Berthe, get out your books. Yes, mademoiselle. Come, Raynald. - Yes, monsieur? - Tell me, please... ...about these sniffles. Is it a cold, do you think? It is too early to say. He will be all right. I'll keep him in today. - Good. Mademoiselle? - Yes, monsieur? There is something I wanted to tell you. If I have fallen short in any way, monsieur... Do you know, we had almost forgotten what peace was... ...until you came into this house. I can't tell you how much it means to me. But, really, monsieur, they're such good children. How foolish my fears seem now. - Fears, monsieur? - About you. Because you were a stranger. From now on, my fear will be that some day... ...you will leave us. Oh, I would not be so foolish as that, monsieur. For as long as the children need me and you wish me to stay. Thank you, mademoiselle. Berthe, my darling, the song is to learn history to, not to dance to. Yes, mademoiselle. I didn't mean to. I'm very sorry. And, Louise, you are old enough to know better. But, mademoiselle, it's so hard to remember things that happened so long ago... ...and way over in England, not France. When I taught an English girl French history, she said the same thing. The war of the Roses is very simple if you just learn the song. The king's coat of arms had the red rose of Lancaster for an emblem... ...and the queen's, the white rose of York. I know. Just like Mama and Papa. She had a crest of her own before she married him. Only his was better than hers. - Mama had the most money. - Not when they were married. She has now. At least Grandfather Sebastiani has. He owns this house. He only lets us live here because Papa married Mama. That's true, mademoiselle. I'll bet it makes Papa simply furious... Now, now, Louise. Some other time. We must finish our song. Berthe, my darling, come here. There. I apologize for intruding on your domain, Mademoiselle Deluzy. But, madame, on the contrary, we wish you would visit us more often. I'm only here now because I was sure this is where I would find monsieur. - He spends so much time with the children. - He left, Mother. - He's gone to make a speech. - About Turkey. So I see he lets his plans be known in the schoolroom. Will it please you to sit down and join us in our lesson? No, not at all. I'd planned on taking a drive with monsieur. Well, I'm not going out alone for all the world to see. Dress Raynald. I'll be waiting in the carriage. I'm sorry, madame. Raynald can't go out this afternoon. What did you say? He has coughed once or twice. It may be a cold. Do I understand that you forbid me to take Raynald, Mademoiselle Deluzy? No, madame. But it is such a raw afternoon and monsieur himself... Is it among the authorities conferred on you by monsieur... ...that you dictate to me concerning my own children? Not at all, madame. If I spoke hastily it was out of concern for Raynald. Sincerely, I meant no offense. If you would choose one of the other... - Mademoiselle Maillard? Yes, madame? Dress Raynald at once. I will dress Raynald, madame. But, mademoiselle, please. - Just think, you're taking Papa's place. A lady needs a gentleman to accompany her. Oh, no, Raynald, the other seat. - You'll spoil my dress. - No, Mama, please. Pardon me. Raynald tells me it makes him ill to ride backwards. Childish nonsense. Go on, Albert. It's a wise chicken that runs to cover at the first clap of thunder. Don't you think so, mademoiselle? She made me ride backwards all the way and when I got sick she scolded me. Yes, cheri, I know, I know. But it's not worth crying about. Such a little thing isn't worth tears. What is this I hear from madame about Raynald? She made me ride backwards, Papa. - He is suffering a slight chill. - Yes, I know. You told me this morning. Yes. It would have been better had he not gone out. Most certainly. Why did you allow it? - I did suggest that with his cough... - Next time, do more than suggest. But when his own mother says... I've made you responsible for my children. There is to be no questioning your authority. You place me in a very difficult position. You know how such authority would be resented. Papa? Papa? Are you angry with mademoiselle? No. No, Raynald. I'm not angry with mademoiselle. I'm very sorry. I understand, monsieur. I know what the children mean to you. Pardon me. I've spoken to the duchess. I think she understands what I've just told you. You see, we must realize that she is sometimes overimpulsive. Her affections run away with her judgment. I appreciate your confidence, monsieur. And Raynald is such a strong little fellow. He will be quite himself by tomorrow. - Won't you, darling? - I'll be better tomorrow, mademoiselle. This hurts, Raynald, I know, but just once more. - Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle. - I'm here, darling. There. We're all finished. That wasn't so bad, was it, now? Poor little fellow. The treatment for diphtheria is always painful, monsieur. Mademoiselle. I want the compress right back. - Yes, doctor. - The throat is badly inflamed. We can only hope to check it from spreading. He must be kept quiet and calm. What about the other children? They're leaving at once for their grandfather's in Corsica. Good. I'll be back this evening. Remember what I told about the windows. - Oh, yes, yes. Of course, doctor. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Mademoiselle, it hurts my neck. There we are. See, Raynald? Now, you're wearing a stock like Papa's. And here is some chocolate. No, no. I don't want it. All right, Maxine. You may go. Be patient, darling. You'll feel better in a little while. If you would bring Raynald his mirror... ...he could see for himself how grown-up he looks. He'll be getting a tall hat and a cane before we know it. Thank you, monsieur. There. Now show Papa how nice you can smile when you want to. See, monsieur? You can't say Raynald isn't a brave little man. And now we're going to have our dejeuner on a tray... ...just like your mother has hers. No, no. It hurts my neck. Let's forget about the chocolate, then. Here's a tangerine. And as I peel it, you must guess how many pieces there are. Do you know how many? No, but we'll soon see. Now, come on. Let's count. - One. - One. - Two. - Two. - And three. - Three. It is not my place to suggest, but might it be better if I stayed here with Raynald... ...and let someone else take the girls away? Ten, 11, 12. Now, let's try this one first. It's nice and cool. Just let the juice run down your throat. I thought I could get someone from one of the hospitals. There. That didn't hurt very much, did it? - Not very much. - No. Now, here's another. I'm sure I could follow the doctor's treatment. That's very, very kind of you, mademoiselle. I'll send the girls away with Maxine, then. My head is loose, mademoiselle. Will it fall off like Berthe's doll that got left in the rain... ...and all the sawdust ran out? No. We'll hold it on tight. Besides, your head isn't filled with sawdust. It's full of good sense and bravery. Will I die and have to take nasty medicine? What an idea. You'll have to take medicine to make you better. But we don't think about dying. But my white rabbit died. And I loved it better than the brown one that didn't. Hush, my darling. You're going to sleep now. Yes, mademoiselle. It seems a shame to shut out the air and the sunlight... ...especially with the warm spring coming. Yes, it does seem a shame. But the doctor says that... Yes, I know, monsieur. Mademoiselle. I want you to know... ...how grateful I am for what you're doing. When madame understands, I'm sure she will be grateful too. I'll be back in a little while. Amen. He is too little to be frightened. Monsieur, Mademoiselle Deluzy. Dr. Louis? Yes, madame? Shouldn't I go in too? No. I think it would be wise not to. I'm afraid you might upset him. I, upset him? I mean, there's great danger of infection. I'm only speaking for your good. How dare you. Isn't a mother's place by her husband at the bedside of her child? There's nothing you can do. Think of your own health. Why should I consider myself? No one else does. Either my wishes or my health, anything. Now, now, my dear. Your welfare is most important to all of us. Father. If you'll go to your room, I'll see you later. My room. I suppose that's where they'd like me to stay. Watch him, keep him quiet and well covered. That is all any of us can do now. I expect the ultimate change for better or worse before night. We can only hope that his strength will carry him through the crisis. Yes, monsieur. Believe me it will. But he has no strength. He's always been frail with a frailness that is a reproach to me. Why do you say that, monsieur? Do you remember that first day you came? I spoke of three children. And then of one who was born several years later. - Yes. - Does that not tell you all there is to know? That he's a symbol of cold embers which should never have been revived even for... Monsieur, please. I'd rather you didn't. Theo? Oh. Father Gallard. I hoped it might be Theo. I've come to bring you what comfort I can. What comfort can there be for me in a house where I'm pushed aside like dirt? Oh, Father, I don't know how much longer I can endure this agony. Have patience, my child. Humiliate your soul and endure with calm the delays of God. The days I spend alone thinking only of him. The nights I weep. My tears mix with the ink as I write him letters. Letters with only the barest hope that he'll so much as read them. I stand outside of his doorway not daring to enter for fear he'll reproach me. Gold and silver are purified by fire... ...but those who God receives as his are proved by humiliation and sorrow. You're my father confessor and in you I truly confide. We're still young, Theo and I, and yet for three years we've lived... Oh, Father, is it a sin for me to love a man so much? Marriage is sanctified in the fullness of the claims between man and woman. Well, then tell him that he's wicked, that he sins. Only I'm repulsed. Even a governess can come and go where she chooses. It may be the necessities of Raynald's illness. No. She's not repulsed. She receives him in his dressing gown in her room. Or she's in his. I'll not have my place in this house usurped by that woman, that servant. Day and night, at any hour, those two, they're always together. Don't be too despairing, monsieur. Crisis must come sometime. Only I wish... Mademoiselle? Yes, darling. It's too dark in here. May I see the garden? The doctor thinks not yet, darling. Perhaps, tomorrow. What is it he wants so much? He complains of the dark and the closeness. It is stifling. He won't believe me when I tell him how green the garden has grown. And that the almond tree is really in bloom. He begs to look out, and if I had my way, I'd let him. Please. Please. The garden, Papa. Sick or well, we're not meant to suffocate in this world. Just the one time. - Please. - It's a very mild day, monsieur. And such a little thing to ask. It will give him a new interest in life to see the garden. After all, sun and air are good for every living thing. I don't know why I should have more confidence in your word... ...only the doctor's... ...yet I do. - Thank you, monsieur. There we are. Papa will carry you. - All right, my boy. - Yes. We're going to take a look at the garden. No weight at all. See, Raynald? The almond tree breathes in the sunshine and the warm spring air. And every day it grows more strong and beautiful. And that is how you must grow, strong and beautiful. Theo. Are you mad? Do you want to kill him, mademoiselle? Theo. Let me go. You're hurting me. Let me go. Let me go. - Then do go. - If he dies tonight it'll be your punishment. God will visit his revenge on this house. Come, darling. We will look at the almond tree again tomorrow... ...if you'll promise to try to get well as hard as you can. Look, mademoiselle. Look. You see? I can run faster than Papa now. Of course you can, darling. Isn't it wonderful, mademoiselle? Yes, it is wonderful, but let's not have too much running for the first day. Ha-ha. He's completely out of hand, mademoiselle. - Isn't he? - Mademoiselle... ...why don't you come down? May I come in, mademoiselle? - Yes. This is from madame. Madame, I hope I have not come at an inopportune moment. But I could not wait any longer to say my thanks for your charming gift. The brooch? Oh, yes. A small souvenir. I'm glad if it pleases you. I would appreciate very much a few words with you alone. Really? Well, I'm quite busy now. The duke and I are going away together this afternoon. I hope you find the children well and happy. Yes, we're going to Corsica to join them. The duke and I. - I will not keep you long. Raynald. - Is that his voice? Give me the ball. - Yes. He's playing with Raynald. - Mademoiselle Maillard? - Yes, madame? - Ask him to come here. Yes, madame. You know, the poor man can hardly wait to get away... ...from everything. I have felt for a long time... ...the need of coming to a closer understanding with you. Your kind message and this expression of your goodwill... ...made me feel this was the right moment. Really, I've never felt the need for any conversation with you. It is just that I wish harmony between us above all things. Even during Raynald's illness, I couldn't help but feel some resentment... ...some disapproval... Mademoiselle, since by some miracle Raynald has survived... ...and according to your notions, you've tended him faithfully... ...let us say no more about it. Madame, even though the children are under monsieur's charge... ...I would like very much to follow your wishes too. Then I can only repeat what any woman has a right to expect: That she come first in her own house, with her own children... ...and with her husband. But truly, madame, no other thought has ever been in my mind. If I have overstepped my position, it has been unintentional. And I assure you I'll be more careful in the future. The future? Oh? Yes. Who knows? Mademoiselle? Yes, my little sleepyhead? I wish we didn't have to go south next week. I wish Papa would come here. I miss Papa, don't you, mademoiselle? Yes, Raynald. I miss Papa and Mama too. I don't very much. What a thoughtless thing to say. Mama loves you very much. Didn't she send you a box of toy soldiers only yesterday? - She makes me ride backwards. - Such a little thing. You don't make me ride backwards, but I think I could if you asked me to. I think I could right now. Darling, I wish you wouldn't even try. But I want to show you. It really isn't necessary. Henriette knows you love her. I won't get sick, I won't get sick. I won't, I won't, I won't. Pierre, I'm riding backwards. What do you think of that? Who has arrived home? That's for me to know and you to find out. I didn't get sick a bit. Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle. We came home. Louise. Papa. - Papa. - Well, well. How is my little boy? I rode backwards. You did? How wonderful. Mademoiselle. How have you been? Don't you notice anything, mademoiselle? - Why, whatever... - Look at me. - What happened? - It's my tooth. It ached and ached. And Papa said he'd bring me to the dentist. Mama said to go to one there... ...but Papa said he wouldn't trust anyone but Dupont. I did it for mademoiselle, all the way home from the park. Raynald looks splendid. Listen. When you take me to the dentist, if I'm very brave... ...Papa has promised a surprise. We planned it and you'll never guess. I didn't get sick one bit, did I, mademoiselle? Guess. We'll wear our best clothes, sit in a box and not go to bed until midnight. Now can't you guess? I remembered you'd never seen Rachel. Did I, mademoiselle? Oh, but how kind. Mademoiselle, why don't you tell Papa I didn't? It was Papa's idea. She plays tomorrow night. And it's the last time she appears as Phedre. After that she's going back to England... ...where you came from. Didn't I, mademoiselle? Look. I didn't know the Duc de Praslin was in town. Flowers, mademoiselle. Just think. Isn't it thrilling? Isn't it perfect to be out with a handsome man like Papa who buys us flowers? Thank you. Here is a program, mademoiselle. - Thank you. - Thank you, monsieur. I wonder who she is. A friend of the duchess, do you suppose? They have a most attractive governess in that house. If they have, and they seem to have, she is most attractive. I mean, as a governess. I'm so excited I can hardly read my program. Now aren't you glad I made you wear your new dress? She doesn't look like a governess at all, does she? - Not at all. - Louise. I wonder what brought the duke back to Paris so suddenly. I heard the duchess was in Corsica alone with her father. Yes? How very convenient. Papa. Mademoiselle. Look, isn't that the king? Yes, darling. Look, mademoiselle. He's greeting us. Do sit down. I think I'm going to die right here. Imagine, my first visit to the theater... ...the king bows to me, and look, everyone is staring at us. Louise, the curtain is about to go up. Why the music, mademoiselle? I thought they only played music in the opera. It's a musical prologue. Now, quiet, darling, please. Yes, mademoiselle. - I beg your pardon. - What is it, mademoiselle? Nothing, monsieur, nothing. I just wondered about the noise. Sorry to have disturbed you, monsieur. Good night. Don't stop, Papa. I love to dance with you. - It's late, dear. I better say good night. - Oh, Papa. - It's long past midnight, Louise. - Must we stop? It's been so wonderful. Thank you, Papa. Thank you, dear mademoiselle. Now I'm sorry I threw away my violets. But I was so excited and the others threw theirs. Even you, mademoiselle, you threw yours. But I wish I'd kept them to remember tonight. May your gentleman offer his flower as a substitute? You're so nice, Papa. Thank you. - Good night, dear. - Good night, Papa. May I thank you, monsieur? I enjoyed it so much. I'm glad you did. I must say that for myself, I prefer comedy. It's a sign of getting old, they say, but I can't help it. There is tragedy enough in the world. I don't think we have to buy our tears. - Good night, mademoiselle. - Good night, monsieur. Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle? Yes, Louise? Do you know what, mademoiselle? I was just thinking. I'm going to give you the flower. - Oh, no, dear. Yes, mademoiselle. You know, we'd never had such a good time before you came. We never had anything like this. Even Papa was never so gay. Yes, you take the flower, mademoiselle. Papa gave it to you and I think you should keep it. - But believe me, mademoiselle. - All right. Suppose we keep it till morning and press it in a book. Oh, I know what I'll do. I'll put it in my diary under the date of June the 11 th, 1846. - Why, darling? - Because that's today. And you know what I'll write under it? "This was the happiest day of my life." You're so excited. Wouldn't you like me to sit with you for a while? No, thank you. Somehow or other I'd rather be alone. - Good night, dear mademoiselle. - Good night, Louise. - Mademoiselle. - Yes, Louise? I just wanted to tell you I love you almost as much as Papa. And I love you too very much, darling. - Sleep well. - I will. We expected to stay until September, but Mama told us... ...that we were coming home that day. I haven't the least idea why, but she seemed all upset. She'd get angry and then she'd cry. Then Grandfather Sebastiani would pat her hand. - Oh, I'm glad to see you. - I am too, mademoiselle. I've missed you both very much. Do you know why Grandfather Sebastiani came back with us? How would I, Isabelle? There's something very funny about it because he hasn't been here for years. On the train, whenever he and the abbe and Mama had their heads together... ...and one of us came, they'd say, "Shh. The children." And talk about the scenery. - Mademoiselle Deluzy? - Yes? The Marechal Sebastiani is waiting to see you in his apartment. Why do you suppose Grandfather wants to see you? Well, I'll tell you better after I know myself. Keep yourselves busy while I am gone. It's almost bedtime, you know. - I wonder why he wants to see her. - Do you think something's wrong? There must be or Grandfather Sebastiani wouldn't have sent for her. Come in. Madame la Duchesse. - Hope you had a pleasant journey. - I did. Thank you. - Father Gallard. - Mademoiselle Deluzy. I am the Marechal Sebastiani. I am very pleased to meet you. I have heard so much from the children. I too have enjoyed the same sort of acquaintance with you, mademoiselle. I could have hoped... ...that our meeting might have occurred under pleasanter circumstances. Oh, Father, let's get this over with. Mademoiselle Deluzy... ...has this newspaper article come to your attention? We are waiting for your explanation. One evening, as governess, I accompanied Louise and her father... ...to dinner and the theater. Does that require an explanation? Do you realize what this means? There are people who write trash and others who read it. You've made a deliberate effort to steal away from me everything that I love. But that you dared plan this last insult. You flaunted your influence over my husband for the king... ...and all of Paris to see. Let me speak for myself, madame. I resent the slander as much, or more than you. Do you realize what this slander, as you call it, implies? - It is clear. - You admit it. I admit nothing. If you do not choose to believe me, then you must believe facts. This house, which is infested by Mademoiselle Maillard and your spies. - Every movement is known. - What do you mean? Just a moment, Frances, let us not be hasty. Well, perhaps there's been nothing actually wrong between you. I have too much faith to believe he would abandon himself with a servant. If your actions have that appearance, it might as well be so. There is every difference between appearance and fact, madame. If as this article implies... ...it appears that you and monsieur are not on good terms... ...are we also to accept that as a fact? What? I'll not tolerate this any longer. Nor will I, madame. - Have I your permission to leave now? - Not yet. Come in. I'm sorry, but madame asked me to tell her. Mademoiselle Deluzy, my daughter means a great deal to me. I haven't been able to buy her happiness... ...I intend to spare her all the humiliation I can. We must find a way out of this difficult situation. Monsieur, it is so simple. I will pack my trunk. That would be as unwise as it is hasty. Why? Since the duchess makes no secret of her dissatisfaction with me. Since it is her happiness which is your only concern. Were you to leave now, it would give credence to this gossip. My son and daughter will be seen together more often in public. And this gossip will die away. You will live here, apparently on the best of terms with both of them... ...and all I require is your promise of more prudent conduct in the future. I assure you my conduct will be no concern of yours in the future. Isn't it enough you humiliate me at home? Must you do it in public as well? The entire court, all of Paris is talking about it. They know you have a wife and you say in your actions... ...as plainly as you could in words that you prefer a servant. Isn't it enough that she's a governess without making her your companion? Theo, you must put an end to it. Mademoiselle, you mustn't leave. You shouldn't have come here. There is enough trouble already. - I beg of you to remember the children. - Don't, monsieur. Raynald owes you his life. Louise, Berthe, Isabelle, who have learned to trust you. - They are young. They will forget. - How...? There are some things it is useless to fight against... ...and one of them is another woman's jealousy. She hates me. Believe me, it will be better for all of us. She will be happier. - And perhaps in time, you and she... - Never. She loves you, monsieur. What kind of love that drives one to madness? If she tortures you and others, it is because she is goaded by her passion. Being a woman too, I can understand that. I hope you will never understand what it is to be smothered by a love... ...which has become insufferable. I shouldn't have presumed to speak about love at all. - I have no right and I ask you to forget it. - I'm glad you did. I've wanted you to know. It's always the same. Demanding, demanding, letters, tears. I live in fear I shall be driven to do something desperate. - You mustn't even think such things. - I know. I know what I'm asking. I know the slights and humiliation you will have to put up with. For myself, I shall do what I can to make it easier. I'll give them their pretense of reconciliation. Their precious appearances they think so important. Mademoiselle, you haven't it in your heart to deny the children and me... ...the only sanctuary we have. But, monsieur, I've always had to fend for myself. - And it's taught me to be practical and... - well, let's be practical, then. She's only one reason to make you want to go... ...and there are five reasons to keep you here. - Five? - Yes, mademoiselle. Four young ones and their father. Shall I count them on my fingers for you? No, monsieur, you needn't trouble. You have asked me and that is enough. If you had tried to bribe or drive a bargain with me... ...I shouldn't be yielding against my better judgment. To be loved as you are in this house is above all bargains. Isn't it wonderful? There, look. Just coming in. It's Victor Hugo. When I grow up, I'm going to give a ball. And there's La Martin, the great poet. He's talking to Chopin. - Oh, I hope he'll play tonight. - The king hasn't arrived yet, has he? Not yet, silly. Everyone will be here, even Rachel. I saw Rachel. You know that, don't you? Oh, yes, we heard about that. Oh, look over there. It's Papa. There's no one here who dances as beautifully as Papa. Doesn't Papa look handsome? I wish I could dance with him. - I danced with him. - You did? Yes. Look, this is how he held me. What are you doing? I put Raynald to bed and looked everywhere for you. - Don't be angry. - Dear, mademoiselle, it's so exciting. We were only looking. - In your nighties too. - Nobody's seen us. Only Papa. He looked up once. I know he saw us. Then he looked right away again with the oddest look, so Ionely. Mademoiselle, why doesn't Papa come to the nursery anymore? Yes, why doesn't he? Well, he does whenever he can. Not as he used to. Never to have fun anymore. Sometimes he comes in with Mama and asks ever so politely about our studies. Mademoiselle, why isn't Papa happy, do you know? Well, you see, your father is working very hard. These are troublesome days for the kingdom. And so sometimes if he appears worried and a little strange... ...it is because he has such big problems of state on his mind. Well, Mama is much pleasanter and I guess we can't have every... Mademoiselle, look, the king. - Your Majesty. - Darling. I want him to bow, then Berthe and Isabelle will believe me. Now come along. You've seen the king. Maxine is waiting to wash your faces. Scamper along. Mademoiselle, is the king a bad man? Pierre says the people will cut off his head. He is not bad. He's Papa's friend and he's my friend. Yes, and he's mademoiselle's too. Mademoiselle, do you think it's the king who stops Papa from coming here? Berthe, your father is a peer of France... ...and has a great many responsibilities to attend to. Mademoiselle, when I grow up, do you think I'll be a peer of France? We'll discuss it tomorrow. Now, now, now, into bed. You must promise me not to talk anymore tonight. Yes, mademoiselle. - Good night, mademoiselle. - Good night, Berthe. - Good night, Louise. - Good night, mademoiselle. Isabelle. Darling. Tears? I'm so unhappy. Isabelle, you? - Why? - I don't know. It isn't anything I can tell anyone. Oh, I'm so afraid. So... ...my little girl is growing up. I don't want to grow up. But, darling, everybody grows up. It's natural and beautiful. It's nothing to be frightened about. Has anyone been telling you things? Ever since Father Sebastiani came, he and the abbe. This morning when I went to confession, the abbe said... He said... Oh, I can't. Darling, don't you know you can trust me? He said, in a year or two, I'd be old enough to get married... ...and I had to prepare myself. Oh. Well, what did he say, Isabelle? He talked about the duties of marriage and submission... ...and I don't even know what he meant. But the abbe didn't mean to frighten you, darling. Sometimes when we are young, life frightens us. Someday when you are in love and are loved in return... ...you will find out then that nothing else matters. Now, if there are things you want to know, you must go to your mother and ask her. Oh, I couldn't do that. When I marry, I don't want to be like Mama. - Isabelle, you shouldn't say... - But that's just it. That's what frightens me. Seeing Mama the way she is, I couldn't even talk to her. But you, I wish you'd tell me. Well, Isabelle, there isn't very much I can tell you. I have never been married, you know. Haven't you ever been in love? Well, I've had the love of my children. But I mean the other kind of love. Does it always make people unhappy? What can I say? If love is right, it is the most precious gift in the world. But you must be sure, very sure, that it is right. For if it isn't... ...there is no worse agony. Nothing more bitter. Nothing more Ionely to be imagined. Thank you, dear mademoiselle. I feel so much better already. I'm sorry I was such a baby. Oh, but you weren't, darling. And we'll talk about it more tomorrow if you want to. Go to sleep now, Isabelle. I will, mademoiselle. Good night. Good night, mademoiselle. Monsieur. I'm sorry. I stood it down there as long as I could. The smiles and bows and hypocrisy. How are the children, actually? Very well, monsieur. Their studies... I miss them. And they miss you. They think about you. They wonder. I wish I knew if I was right when I agreed... Has madame told you our plans about next Saturday? No, I have not seen madame for several days. I'm rather glad she didn't tell you, for it's good news. We're taking the children to Melun for the holidays. Oh? I've heard so much about Melun from the children. It is your home. Yes. Yes, it's my home. It must be beautiful in the country at this season. How good it will be to get away from... From here. The first snow. Yes, it's come early this year. How like a fairyland it makes the garden look. Why are you smiling? May I share whatever pleases you so much? You will think I am very silly, I'm afraid. But standing here like this with the snow falling... ...reminds me of something I used to know. Do you remember the little round glass globes that...? Oh, yes, I know. With a snow scene inside. We had a paperweight on the desk at home like that. You shook it and the snow whirled out from nowhere in a blinding storm. Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Then if you looked closely enough... ...the whole rest of the world seemed to be... ...obliterated and shut out. I'll tell the children about Melun. I'm sure they'll be delighted. Thank you, mademoiselle. - Good night. - Good night. Good evening, monsieur. I trust you had a pleasant time. - Who are you? - I am Charpentier. - Charpentier? - Your new valet, monsieur. Since when are you my valet? Since this evening when the marechal was kind enough to engage me. - Oh? The marechal engaged you? - Yes. How thoughtful of the marechal. - Shall I prepare you for bed now? - No, thank you. - I'm capable of preparing myself for bed. - Is there anything I can do for you? Yes, you can get out. Tell your master I'll give him a report of my activities. - But... - Good night. Good night, monsieur. Who is it? It's only me. It's very late. Oughtn't you to be sleeping? I ought to, but I couldn't. What about you? Oughtn't you to? Or couldn't you, either? - What do you want, Pierre? - This is from the master. Now, now, not so eager. You stand there on tenterhooks for a minute or two. - Was that meant for humor, Pierre? - Humor's a wonderful thing... ...and we shouldn't waste any of it that comes our way. For instance, in a way, there's humor in the master... ...sending me out in the middle of the night... ...to buy trinkets for the pretty governess. - There is no humor in impertinence, Pierre. - That's another thing, impertinence. It's a privilege that comes with old age and partly makes up for other losses. I'll give you a little bit of impertinent but good advice, mademoiselle. Run. Run out of this house for your life if it's not too late. I haven't the least idea what you're talking about. I'm talking about a man who has a wife. - How dare you. - Now, now, you must forgive an old man... ...for talking so plainly. But I watched you come into this difficult household... ...and I know what your presence has meant to the children and to monsieur. I've loved him ever since he was a little boy running around at Melun. He's a fine gentleman, mademoiselle. Yes, he is, Pierre. And I think you're a fine person too. That's why I dare to speak to you like this. Don't you know there has never been a word between the duke and myself... ...that couldn't be shared by all the eyes in the world? But your feelings, could they be shared? Yes, of course. Then why do you stand at this window? Not now, but so often. What is it you see from here? Is it perhaps the lights in the other wing of the house? Look, mademoiselle, there on the left, the lights in her rooms are burning... ...and there on the right, the lights in his room are burning. And between them is that long passage where the lights never burn. Suppose some night you saw that passage lighted. Could you share your feelings then with all the world? - You had better go now, Pierre. - Yeah. Yeah, I'll go. I'll go because I see it's too late to give you any warning. You're caught in the net and you don't even wish to escape. Good night, mademoiselle. Then if you looked closely enough... ... the whole rest of the world seemed to be obliterated and shut out. Now, you look after the duke and the duchess. George, you take care of mademoiselle and the children. Put the master's luggage in the other carriage. Hasn't madame's luggage come down? Not yet, monsieur. Well, I'll see about it. I hope there will be lots of snow. - Hello, all ready? - Oh, Papa. Are we really going? We certainly are, as soon as your mother is ready. Did you pack enough woolen stockings for yourself? - I hope Marie will go sleigh riding. - What time will we arrive? Frances, the children are wait... - I understand, madame. May I go now? - Yes. Yes. Excuse me, Monsieur le Duc. May I have Pierre come for your luggage? Theo, last night I poured my heart out to you in a letter. I crept to your door. I'm forbidden to enter... ...and stooped and pushed it under the sill. - I received it, Frances. - But look... ...you didn't even open it. Oh, Theo, do you suppose this empty pretense is what I'd hoped for? Last night I begged you to come to me. I'd hoped that we might start this journey today united as we once were. Theo, have you completely forgotten the life we once shared together? If you're unhappy, Frances, I'm truly sorry... ...but I swear, I never intended you pain. Oh, no, you only say that. In reality, you delight in torturing me... ...as one day, heaven willing, I will torture you. - We'll be waiting for you in the carriage. - You needn't trouble. I'm not going. What do you mean, you're not...? - Not going? - I'll not step one foot out of this house... ...with that woman. - The children will hear. It's time they realized how you conspire against their mother. - You who've turned them against me. - If you don't stop... They'll realize how I loved them... ...when I'm dead and out of your way. Then it'll be too late. In heaven's name, Frances. Theo! Let me go. Let me go. I'll put myself out of your way, I'll never trouble you again. Frances! No, Theo! Papa, don't let her. Mademoiselle. May I have the baggage, please? What's the matter? Didn't you hear me? I've got to take the baggage. Certainly, Pierre. Come, children. Get up. Mademoiselle, why does Mama hate everybody? - Shh. Berthe. - But she does. You're wrong. You must remember that your Mama is often ill and tired. But... Come now. Into the carriage with you. - But... - Your mother's all right. So don't look so frightened. She asked me to tell you that she doesn't feel up to traveling. You and mademoiselle are to go just the same. - Are you coming? - Not this time. - But that spoils everything. - Let's not have any argument. You'll miss your train. - Come now. - Hurry. Come. - You will come and see us, won't you? - You must. - Please, Papa. Yes. Perhaps. Oh, Pierre, take them into the carriage, please. - Then take down my luggage. - Yes, monsieur. - You are telling the truth? She didn't...? - No. - She didn't harm herself. - Oh, thank heaven. Monsieur, we can't go on like this. Here are the tickets. I'm sure you will give the children a good time. See that they write to their mother. I shall think of all of you during the holidays. - What happened? - Oh, it's nothing. But why do you keep your hand hidden, then? I didn't want to frighten the children. It's nothing, really. Only a slight cut. A letter opener. The blade was sharper than I thought. You're sure it's nothing serious? Shall I send the baggage cart along, monsieur? Yes, Pierre. Isabelle. Louise. Where are you? Isabelle. Louise. It's getting dark, mademoiselle. I wish we brought the dogs. Now, really, children, it's getting late. You know Loti is waiting for us. Where are you? Well, I suppose we better keep on looking for them. Isabelle. Louise! - Mademoiselle? - Yes, darling? Mademoiselle, what shall we do if we meet a ghost? Well, I suppose there are good ghosts as well as bad ones. Oh, no, mademoiselle, not on All Hallows' Eve. Just the devil and the witches. - Mademoiselle, let's go home. Boo! - I'm a goblin. I'm a witch. I'm a ghost. - Isabelle, Louise, you frightened me. - We could hardly keep from laughing. - We were behind you. - I thought the goblins had gotten you. - Oh, no, mademoiselle. - We were behind you all the time. Come on. I thought you nearly saw us. Mademoiselle, let's go home. Hush, darling. It's only an old song. A ghost. Mademoiselle, a ghost. - Now, Berthe. - But really, mademoiselle. Look over there. It's a ghost. A pretty solid ghost, I must say. Don't you know your own father? - Papa, what a surprise. - What are you doing here? I knew where to find you. You know, Loti roasted apples for me when I was no bigger than Raynald here. That's what I did, monsieur. Fix Papa an apple. - Yes, Louise. - We were so unhappy you weren't with us. - Whatever made Mama change her mind? - Mama is not here. I asked her to come but she preferred to remain in Paris... ...with your grandfather and the abbe. And you came all alone on the train? Oh, heavens, no. I had Pierre to protect me. I hadn't intended to come at all but as the holidays approached... ...and I thought of all of you... ...I couldn't resist. Well, mademoiselle, do you like All Hallows' Eve at Melun? You shouldn't have... Yes, very much, monsieur. Here, monsieur. Won't you join us at the fire? Please do, Papa. I should like to join this family very much if I'm welcome. But I can go right back to Paris if there are any objections. Oh, no, Papa. Don't think of such a thing. And you, mademoiselle? Whatever you think best, monsieur. - Are you sure the children are all right? - Oh, but Pierre is with them. And we promised that after the carousel, they could see the puppet show. - I know but it's late. It's a long drive home. - Good evening. Good evening. How is Madame Gauthier? - Fine, thank you. - Oh, here she is. Bless my eyes, if it isn't Monsieur le Duc. - Madame Gauthier, how good to see you. - We have missed you in Melun, monsieur. - The children, are they with you? - They'll be here. Mademoiselle Deluzy, this is Madame Gauthier. Now, what have you got to warm us? How about a bottle of my special brandy? We always have some, monsieur. Jean, quick. - Why not sit by the fire, mademoiselle? - Thank you. - It's a long time since I saw you last. - Madame Gauthier... ...I must say you haven't changed a bit. - Ha-ha-ha. - May I help you with your coat? - Thank you. - I must confess, monsieur, I was cold. - Ha-ha-ha. Oh, how the children must have grown. Wait till you see. Oh, here's your brandy. Jean, take this. It will be nice to see them again. Raynald, with his big eyes. Berthe, Louise. Isabelle must be of an age for marrying. Madame Gauthier? - Coming. Excuse me. There, you see? I can't hide anything. Even an old friend reminds me that I am next door to being a grandfather. Don't be ridiculous, monsieur. At Melun, you're the youngest of them all. Why shouldn't I be? Do sit down. Let me have your boots. Thank you. Don't you think we all like to go back to the time... ...when we were happiest? You see, here at Melun, I can forget. But what about you? We've always talked about the children. It's been "mademoiselle" this and "monsieur" that. And there's been so much I wanted to know about you. - What shall I say? - Well, tell me about yourself. Were you happy as a child? Well, I was alone, except for my grandfather. And he never quite forgave me for having been born. He had his reasons. Was that why you became a governess, because you were alone? I've often wondered. Since I loved children, what better? Marriage. You could grace any home. I should never marry, monsieur. May I ask why you say that? Well, there is some mystery in my birth, just what Grandfather would never tell me. It has not always been pleasant living with this blank. I sometimes feel like those silhouettes artists cut out of black paper... ...and paste against a white card. Just the outlines of a person standing against nothing. How awful for you. Oh, please forgive me. I do not want you to feel sorry for me. I have the children. And even though they're not mine, I sometimes imagine they are. And when I tuck them in bed... ...and know they will wake up in the morning still loving me, life is good. Though I shouldn't quarrel with the good fortune that brought you to our house... ...as your friend, I could wish you something quite different. May I ask what, monsieur? It would make me most happy to think of you... ...sitting before your own fire... ...with your own children playing near at hand. And your own husband looking at you and counting his blessings. - It's late. Hadn't we better be going? - Oh, please don't go. Don't even move. Why? I might say "don't move" because as you sit there... ...the firelight is so beautiful on your hair. I might say "don't move" because it is All Souls' Day... ...and you mustn't disturb the spirits. And again, I might say... ..."don't move"... ...because this is a moment so full of understanding... ...that I can't bear to see it come to an end. Didn't we have a lovely time? Papa, do you think we'll visit Madame Gauthier tomorrow? Oh, I think we can manage. - Madame makes wonderful hors d'oeuvres. I think the pastries she wrapped for us were better. - Now, you mustn't come in with us. - Why ever not? We've bought a surprise and it isn't wrapped. So you must promise to stay out here for five minutes. Please, mademoiselle. - See she obeys, Papa. - I surely will. If you'll give us a few minutes, your patience will be rewarded. Help them, Pierre, will you? - Don't worry, mademoiselle. I will. It's been a long day. You must be tired. No, I'm not tired. I'm frightened. Would you have preferred I hadn't come here? No. And I can't deny it's been beautiful to have you here these last few days. And I tried not to think of the accounting that you and I, too, will have to give. Whatever comes, I promise you won't have to face it. I can't help but feel, this time you will pay very dearly. I always pay. Sometimes I pay most for what I never had. It is not unfair that for a few days I have had what I can never pay for. - Please, monsieur. - These few hours... ...this little glimpse of what life might have been. - I hadn't asked for more. - No. And if it had been only one hour, one minute... ...it would have been worth throwing away everything for. Knowing it could never last? It will last as long as it is remembered. Monsieur, if you will be kind enough to step into the study. Would you tell the children I'll be up in a few minutes to say good night? Mademoiselle Deluzy, just a moment. But madame, I supposed you... Monsieur is downstairs... whatever is told him downstairs, I am here to make sure that you understand. This time you've gone too far, mademoiselle. You're to leave this house into which you've brought evil and sin. Yes, madame, there is evil in this house. But it was here before I came. It was not I who brought it. What intrigue beneath that mask of innocence. It was not enough for you to be a governess. No. You had to conspire to become mistress... ...to steal everything that was mine, including the affections of my children. Affections cannot be stolen, madame. They are given freely or not at all. If you had been a mother to your children, if you had earned their love... ...nothing I could have done would ever have made... You used them shamelessly to attract him, to separate him from me. You have deceived yourself into believing that. Have you not one shred of decency? How dare you entice him to come to you here? To confess that you and he, to admit openly without delicacy that you... why do you stop? I challenge you to accuse me of what you know is not true. I am not here to challenge you in a matter that is personal. I am here to dismiss an unsatisfactory servant. Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle, if you will agree to leave without making a disturbance... ...I am prepared to deal generously with you. I will give you a letter, clearing your name of all scandal... ...praising you as the most excellent of governesses... ...affirming that you're leaving of your own free will. Madame, I don't know what to say. What of the children? I promised Monsieur le Duc... You needn't hope that this time he will protect you. A man who has found it so easy to replace a wife... ...will not find it difficult to replace a governess. Wait a minute, mademoiselle. We're not ready yet. - Oh. I had forgotten. - Won't be but a second. - May I help you take off your hat and coat? - Oh, yes, thank you, Louise. Yes. We're nearly ready. It's a surprise. - We can hardly wait for you to see. - Are you ready? - Not quite. - Well, hurry up. Just one little second. - Ready. - Now you may look. There, for you. You must open it all by yourself. - You'll never guess. - We've been planning for the longest time. That's why we wanted you to go to Madame Gauthier's with Papa. We never went to the puppet show at all. See, mademoiselle, it's another box. Now you must open this one. Why didn't Papa come up and see too? Mademoiselle, why didn't he? - He'll be here presently. And here's another one. Wait till you see what's in this. - Oh, do hurry, mademoiselle. Yeah, do. This is the very last. Open it quickly, mademoiselle. There it is. Oh, we do hope you'll like it. - We knew you didn't have one. - So we bought it with our pocket money. - It's so beautiful. - Aren't you pleased? We didn't tell a soul, not even Papa. Wasn't it funny with all the boxes? Ha-ha-ha. But mademoiselle, you haven't opened it yet. Yes, mademoiselle, we have writing on the inside. - Like on Mama's jewelry. Read it out loud, mademoiselle. Now you must turn it over. "Melun. November 2nd, 1846." We picked it out ourselves. We got it so you'd always remember today and us and Melun. Come in. Mademoiselle, if you will step downstairs. - I will talk to mademoiselle. - But... - Do as I say. - Yes. - Look what we bought. - Yes. - Show him. - Just one minute. - I have something to say to mademoiselle. - It's time for bed. - Don't you want to see? - What has happened? - Nothing. Do as mademoiselle says. - But... Help the little ones undress. I'll be in in a moment. I'll be in a minute. - Aren't you coming? Isabelle will help you. I'll be in just a minute. Monsieur. If you could have heard them. To believe that you and I, with the children here. They and everyone else. The marechal showed me the papers. You can imagine what they're saying. Full of pity for the wife left ill and deserted while her husband openly carries on... - Oh, it's too shameful. - I beg you, monsieur. Right you were to call it madness. My madness. To think that we could escape, even for one moment... ...from their pious hypocrisy. Henriette... ...tell me, say something to me. Don't just stand there. Help me! If there were anything I could say or do to help you... ...I would. I'm sorry. Sometimes I think they'll never stop until I'm truly mad. I beg you to forgive me. My dear friend... ...we have both known how it had to end. Yes. We've both known. Deep in our hearts, we've known that if ever you go away, I will go too. - No, monsieur. - Wherever you go, I will go. You are desperate. Yes, I, too, am desperate. It would be easy to do something we will regret. To stay here and see you go, that I would regret. I couldn't bear it. To be here and have you gone, say your name and not have you answer. Don't leave me. If you were to come away with me... ...what could we say having made them right? Even if I were to stay, what might not happen between us? No, I must go now, monsieur. But you... Once before, when I was leaving, you asked me to stay. It was because of the four in there you asked it. Loving them, we must think of their future. Of Isabelle and Louise and Berthe, who will be ready for marriage. Who must not grow up disgraced in their society... ...and their church by our doing. None of this is their fault. They alone are innocent, actually. As for ourselves... ...I came into your house, my dear friend... ...and in your unhappiness, you reached out your hand for help... ...and in my Ioneliness, I took it. And we have had such a friendship as is given to very few. But where will you go? What will you do? I have my work. There are other positions, other children. After all... ...everyone can't expect in all this world... ...to be one singled out to have one's heart's desire. See, monsieur. They wanted me to show it to you. "Love to mademoiselle. Isabelle, Louise, Berthe, Raynald. Melun. November 2nd, 1846." I wish my name were included here. It is. It always will be. Will it be any comfort to you to know that when you're gone... ...my only happiness will be in knowing that I'm sharing your Ioneliness? Bless you. Will you say goodbye to the children for me? If you wish. No. I must. But I don't know what to tell them. Mademoiselle, did Papa like it? Berthe, be quiet. - Come here, darlings. - What happened, mademoiselle? Is anything wrong, mademoiselle? Papa seemed so strange. I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. Did Papa bring it? Is that it? No, it's just I have to go away. Go away? Where? Mademoiselle, are you ill? You look ill. No, I'm not ill. It's... My grandfather is ill. But you never even told us you had a grandfather. Well, I didn't think it concerned you, dear. But mademoiselle, everything that concerns you concerns us. When must you go? Tonight. Now. Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle, don't go away. Really, you can't. How long will you be gone? I'm afraid, for a very long time. Please don't cry. Isabelle, you are the eldest. I rely on you to look after the little ones. Mademoiselle. I'll write. Is mademoiselle coming back? I don't know, Raynald. I hope she will. All I can say is, I can't wait on and on and on. Sorry about the rent. I never intended to be a burden to you. And I never intended to let you. Hmp! Month after month. I suppose there has to be a first time for every foolishness. - If you wish me to leave... - Nonsense. Where would you go? Henriette, let's be practical. You know the fix you're in as well as I do. A governess has one stock-in-trade. That's her good name. - You throw yours away. - Surely you don't believe that. Well, when I was young, they used to say that people only threw stones at trees... ...that were loaded with fruit. But I'm an old friend and I believe you instead of gossip. No one else will ever believe you until you produce a letter from the duchess. - She promised she'd send me one. - Yes, so you've told me. That was November. This is August. It's a long time to believe in a promise. I'd be only too glad to give you a position here tutoring my students... ...but even this poor establishment has its reputation to think of. I've written her over and over. I still believe she intends to send it. Hand me such a letter and I'll put you to work at once. Without it, to state plain facts, you'll never work here nor any other place. I know. I ought to know. - Henriette? - Yes. What does Monsieur le Duc have to say to all this? I've never told him. He thinks I have a position here. What's this you say? You've let him come here to see you with the children twice... ...and you've never even told him about the letter from the duchess? No. That's why you've always asked for the parlor instead of bringing him up here. Because you know that he would guess... ...that everything is not as right as you wish to pretend. - I'd rather not discuss it. - Oh. Well, you better do something about it. Madame LeMaire... ...will it trouble you too much if I ask for the parlor again today? Oh. Is the duke coming again? Yes, I had a letter from Louise. "Hope you are well and happy. We miss you. Do you miss us? Papa asks me to tell you that on the 17th of August... ...we'll come to visit you on our way back from Melun." - Today is the 17th. - So I see. Best dress and everything. Well, use the parlor, but this time, use it to some purpose. - You're good to me. Really good. - Oh, don't get sentimental. I hate it. I must say one thing for you, Henriette. The purse in which you keep your courage... ...is not as empty as the purse in which you keep your money. Mademoiselle! We were afraid you might not wait. Oh, but you knew I would. This is such a pleasure. We had to take a later train. We came directly from the station. It was so sweet of you to bring them all. You don't know how glad I am too. How are you? Thank you, never better. And you, monsieur? It has been such a long time since your last visit. Me? The days go by, one after the other. Come along and see what we've brought you. Let us go into the parlor. Oh, mademoiselle, if only you cold see Melun now. It is so beautiful there. Monsieur le Duc? Him, too, mademoiselle. I've missed you. - May I have a word? - With me? - Yes. It concerns our mutual friend. Mama told us that we were coming home that day. Where is Pierre? He couldn't come. - He wasn't feeling very well. I would loved to have seen him. And Raynald, roses and forget-me-nots. Berthe, you remembered how I love mignonette. Yes, and ferns from the woods too. And the fruit, mademoiselle. Grapes and peaches. - The very largest peaches. Look at my basket, mademoiselle. And these are all for you, from Melun. The strawberries were all gone. It was early for blackberries. This melon isn't ripe yet. But anyways, it's the first off the vines. Look, mademoiselle. How sweet of you to remember me like this. When are you coming back? - We must go now. Say your goodbyes. - But, Papa, we only just came. It's late, and I wish to speak to mademoiselle. - May we come and see you soon? - Yes. Run along. - Raynald. Isabelle. - Good night. - We'll come back soon. - Do come to see us. Good night, mademoiselle. Why didn't you tell me? If only Madame LeMaire hadn't interfered. It was time someone interfered. You would still go on lying to me, pretending you had a position here. You've enough trouble. If you had told me it was only a matter of a letter from her. I kept hoping she'd send one. I wrote many times. When did you write? What did she say? What dare she say? She never replied. She answered nothing. Nothing? Is nothing an answer? Yes, nothing would be her answer. When the weak are also cruel, we should beware of them, my friend. The weak know how to use their power. They have soft, white hands with which to squeeze and squeeze. Monsieur, you frighten me. I frighten you? That look on your face. Oh? Is it as noticeable as that, that I'm going mad? Oh, please. Let's forget the letter. I'll manage. Come to the house tomorrow. Come at 2:00. I'll go back to England. I'll do anything. Come tomorrow. Come at 2. You'll have the letter. So you see, when you burst in here as late as this... ...and threaten me with your anger, you're only acting foolishly. I'm sorry, Frances. I had no idea that the letter was already written. Well, perhaps there's an apology due from me too. I've been thoughtless. Poor Mademoiselle Deluzy must have suffered. Has she suffered? Well, surely you know. You went to see her tonight, did you not? You left me at the train and took my children to see her. Yes, I went to see her and took the children. And yes, she has suffered. And you have suffered too, poor Theo, haven't you? - Just give me that letter. - Oh, but wait. I want to read it to you. I must be sure that it meets with your approval. "August 17, 1847. To whom it may concern: I hereby recommend Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy... ...for those excellent qualities of mind and character... ...by which she has endeared herself to us during her service... ...as governess in my household. She left with mutual regret and at her own request. Signed, Frances, Duchesse de Praslin." - Do you find that satisfactory, Theo? - Oh. It's more than satisfactory, Frances. It is generous. I wasn't fair to you, Frances. Oh, but wait. I've written another also. Perhaps you'll like it even better. This letter is so important to Mademoiselle Deluzy... ...I must be sure that you are entirely pleased. "To whom it may concern: I hereby certify that Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy... ...was employed in my household as governess... ...against the unheeded pleadings of me, their mother. From the first she conspired to deprive me of everything I hold dear. My children she taught to hate me... ...and with my husband she consorted brazenly. Finally, I could bear no more and I had her sent from my house, never to return. And all this, I certify to be God's truth. Frances, Duchesse de Praslin." Which letter do you like the best, Theo? To think that I almost believed you. Oh, but I'm only offering you your choice, dear Theo. But then, perhaps it doesn't matter... ...for there's really very little difference between them. You see? And I'll tell you something more. No letter will I ever write... ...except one that will prevent her doing to another what she's done to me. Thinks she'll be safer in another country, she's mistaken. If she goes to England, I'll write to England. And if she chooses another country, my hatred will follow. Even if she crosses the ocean, I won't spare her. No matter where she goes. If she goes to the ends of the Earth, my hatred will follow her! Theo. Theo. Theo! L... I didn't mean it. L... No. No. No! Theo, you couldn't! You wouldn't. L... Have mercy. You're mad, Theo. No, Theo, I didn't mean it. Theo, no. No, Theo. Theo, have mercy. Have mercy. Theo, Theo. No! No, Theo! Theo! No! So it's come to this. Gendarmes in my house. Scandal, notoriety, ruin. Yes, here it is. Don't knock. Open the door. Are you Henriette Deluzy-Desportes? What? The duchess has been murdered. This is what you've brought. No more talk. Get into your clothes. Don't touch anything in this room. I always knew something terrible would happen. - You must tell me. You can't arrest me. - I'm not here to tell you. - I'm here to take you to the Conciergerie. - Stand back, will you? It should be hard for you to get out. Murder. The Duchesse de Praslin murdered. Here's the victim. Duchesse de Praslin murdered. As I remember, it was in the middle of the night... ...when Mademoiselle Maillard and I ran to the duchess's apartment... ...and pounded on the doors. They were all locked. And then we ran around the garden and up the outside stairs. There we found a door unlocked. It was too late. The duchess was lying at the foot of the bed. In a few moments, she died in Mademoiselle Maillard's arms... ...without having been able to say a single word. Poor madame, so good, so kind. It's that woman who's at the bottom of this. Anything further? Yes, monsieur. When I saw there was nothing to be done, I went to summon the duke. Halfway there, I met him and he followed me back into this room. - What was his behavior? - He was extremely agitated. What did he say? What were his words? This is important. Well, he asked me three questions: "Did she speak? What do you think of it?" And, "Have you seen anything?" And as he said this, he seemed very uneasy. Well, why don't you question him, not me? Will you sign your deposition? Right there. Next. Mademoiselle Hortense Maillard. And please do not leave the room. I may want to question you again. Mademoiselle Maillard, your testimony is of vital importance to this investigation. And when I heard the cries of the servants, I took a pistol... ...then went in the duchess's bedroom to find what you already know. Have you any explanation which may account for this tragedy? No. Well, perhaps the intruder? That was our first thought, robbery. But since there's nothing missing, we've dismissed it. Did the duchess have any enemies who might have wished to harm her? No. One does not wish death to anyone. I'm not so sure of that, monsieur. Would you care to explain the bloodstains on the clothing you were wearing? There was blood everywhere. She was covered with blood. When you came to your room, you attempted to wash the blood off. Did you not? Yes, I wanted to see the children and to tell them... God help them. This testimony of the valet is very strange, monsieur... ...concerning the doors to the duchess's room. It appears they were locked at first... ...and then mysteriously, they were no longer locked. I remind you that as a peer of France, I'm not accountable to officers. How right you are, monsieur. Under the laws of France... ...you are accountable only to the House of Peers. I wonder how someone must feel... ...who is not fortunate enough to find herself in such a lofty position. Whom do you mean? What are you leading to? An investigating judge doesn't lead to anything. He only follows where the evidence leads. In this case, possibly to the Conciergerie to the cell of a Mademoiselle D. I believe you know her very well, monsieur. She can have no possible connection with this affair. No possible connection. Leave her out of it. You ask me questions, questions. But you won't tell me anything. The prosecutor would like more concerning your relations with the deceased. From the testimony of the servants, letters and other papers of the duchess... ...it appears that for a long time, you've been guilty of wrongs toward her. You did not have the regard and deference you should have. You tried to take away from her... ...the affections of her husband and children. No, that is not true, monsieur. When I came into the household, things were already on a bad footing. There was already little affection between mother and children. There were causes of dissension between the duke and duchess... ...which it was not in my power to end. If later the duchess said I was the cause of her unhappiness... ...it only goes to show the workings of a mind... ...so tortured by the most horrible and unreasonable of jealousies. If you had known her, lived in the house with her, you would understand. Whatever your interpretation of the relations between yourself and the duke? You are referring to scandals which were not true. - True enough to result in your dismissal. - In my leaving. But not to giving up influence over members of that household as you should have. How many times have you seen the duke since then? - Three times. - Alone? No, he always came with the children. What has become of the children? Only answer the questions. - Did you see him on August the 17th? - He came with all four of the children. Did you see him alone on that occasion? - For a few minutes. - Why? - To console each other in your separation? - No. We discussed a letter of recommendation which the duchess had promised me. I do not understand this line of questioning. Have you not learned that there are grave indications... ...accusing the duke of having killed his wife? No. No. That is impossible. He... He who could never bear to see one of his children suffer. I don't believe it. Tell me it isn't true. I beg you. Tell me. He couldn't. He was so gentle. I wish I could take you into a certain room, mademoiselle. There you would see, written in blood... ...the record of a struggle a woman put up for her life. Handprints from wall to wall, bell pull to bell pull, from door to door... ...as she struggled helplessly to escape the blows... ...of the assassin who struck her down. Listen to me, he could never have done this dreadful thing. If he should have had part in it, it is I who am guilty... ...because I asked too much. I was wrong, wrong. I see it all now. And now it's too late. He must have gone to the duchess demanding that letter of recommendation. She must have refused him and then... There, you see. I am guilty. Write it down in your records there, guilty. I, I alone, never him. Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes... ...you are to be held in the murder of the duchess. - Take her out. - Please. Please believe me. It is I alone who am guilty. - Come this way. - No. Sometimes it is difficult to tell from the sound of a mob... ...whether the people are inciting a revolution or having a good time. But on this occasion, I'm afraid it is clear. We can't afford to delay longer, Your Majesty. I hesitate to say it, but there's already much dissatisfaction. And now comes this scandalous crime casting a blood over the whole peerage. The Duc de Praslin and this woman must be brought to judgment quickly. - Poor Theo. - Shield him will cost the throne of France. Yes, the people demand their blood. - Can you get a conviction? - You must. There are difficulties, Your Majesty. In order to convict, we must establish a motive. If I may say, it lies in the sinful relation between the duke and the governess. Yes, but where can we turn for conclusive evidence? To scandalous newspaper articles? To the gossip of servants? To the letters of a wife who never accused her husband? What is necessary, what we must have is an admission from the accused... ...both of them, or one of them, of their guilty love. Then you must get this admission in any way you can. Baron Pasquier, as chancellor of France and president of the House of Peers... ...it will be your duty to question the duke and this woman. If he is found guilty, you will bind her over to be tried in public court. I've prepared this order for the arrest of the Duc de Praslin. It only needs Your Majesty's signature. He was my friend. "And in view of Article 29 of the Constitutional Charter... ...requiring that no peer be arrested except by authority of the chamber... ...we have ordered the following: Article 1, the Court of Peers shall be convened. Article 2, the court will proceed to the investigation... ...and judgment of the crime imputed to Theobald Duc de Swazer of Praslin. Done at the Palace 'd'eu, August 19th, 1847. Signed, Louis-Philippe." So be it. It has been decided to imprison you here rather than risk transporting you to a prison. People are enraged at an act... ...so foully committed against a noble and religious woman. It would be unsafe through the streets. I appreciate your solicitude for my safety. I implore you now for an open and full confession. Did you commit the crime of which you are accused? Who can say what a crime is? You dare to affirm that you're not guilty? Since you've come with the conviction of my guilt... ...nothing I might say would change your opinion. Your family and friends would like to believe... ...that you were driven into such a barbarous act by a passion you regret. Were you not urged by the evil advice of someone else? I received no advice from anyone. One doesn't give advice in such matters. Monsieur, we are prepared to deal with you as liberally as we can. Only say that you were forced to do it, and perhaps you will save yourself. Certainly, you will save the throne and all of us. What is one woman's life compared to these? You make me ashamed that I know you. Then I have no alternative but to hand you over to the king's prosecutor. What were your relations with Henriette Deluzy? She was once governess to my children. And to you, monsieur? She was my children's governess. She brought them peace and order... ...where once there had been fright and confusion. She gave them the love that had been denied them. But to you, yourself? Once, she saved my son's life. Did you know that? How queerly we reward those who have been faithful. You persist in speaking only of the children. We demand an honest answer to a plain question. Did you love this woman? Love? Do you know the meaning of the word? I believe we are all thinking of the same thing. I did not love her. I give you one last chance to save yourself. I warn you, monsieur, you will give a truthful answer to that question. We've only begun. And if it takes hours or days, we'll get it from you. Are you quite sure? What did you say? Oh, I was just thinking... ...that there is more than one answer to a question. I don't understand you. I did not intend that you should. Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy. Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy. - Yes? - Follow me. Mademoiselle, there is a visitor waiting for you in your cell. A visitor? For me? Yes, mademoiselle. Perhaps you don't remember me. Yes, I remember. - Mr? - Henry Field. - You are the American minister. - I hoped you'd remember. How did you get in here? I'm not allowed visitors. They may deny you visitors but not the consolation of a minister. I read of your trouble. I came as fast as I could. You're not asking me to believe you came because I was in trouble? That must surprise you... ...but it was some impulse stronger than my will that compelled me. Perhaps because that other time we met... ...in such a brief encounter... ...and I saw that even then you were not happy. I had wanted to say something to you. And ever since, I've regretted that I was afraid to. What could you have had to say to me then or even now? Just a word of faith that might be some comfort. All ministers have their faiths. Most of them preach that one must endure with patience... ...the miseries of this world in order to earn happiness in another. But I believe that no matter what our despair... ...there is a heaven on this earth for each of us. If we can only find it. A woman is dead, the children I loved are orphaned. I'm afraid I can't believe in your heaven on earth, Mr. Field. You must try not to be bitter. Don't you know you can't help me but will only harm yourself? You are a minister. And I? Don't you know what they're saying about me? - But it isn't true. - Suppose I tell you it is? It will make no difference. You are a fool. I went to your lodging and gathered your belongings... ...the police had not confiscated. I thought you might be glad to have them. Then I went to the residence, thinking you'd want to know about the children. I talked to an old servant named Pierre. What has become of the children? They've been sent to Corsica to their grandfather. Their mother is to be buried there. I couldn't think of anything to do... ...except come here and let you know you have a friend. You have been very kind, Mr. Field. I'm sorry I was rude just now. I understand. You are to be questioned before... ...the Commission of the House of Peers. Are you well-prepared? - Have you good legal counsel? - No, I do not wish a lawyer. I will tell them all they want to know. After all, I have the truth to rely on. I call your attention to the fact that in your first questioning... ...you made a most violent avowal of your own guilt in this crime. I said I should not have asked for the letter. I should have accepted my fate. In that, I was guilty. - When you sent him for the letter... - I did not. I begged him to forget it. So much the worse for both of you. It demonstrates the spell you had him under. The power you held over him which resulted from the passion... ...that was between you. We always return to that, don't we, monsieur? Yes, and we will always return to it. Then I will tell you again, I did not bring sin into that home... ...since that is in your mind. I could not have done it out of respect for the children. I could never have kissed their pure brows if I had been guilty of that. They were like my own children. Though perhaps I was wrong to think of them in that way. Can't you understand that it is possible to love honestly? Can you call it an honest love when it results in a violent crime and death? Oh, yes, monsieur, it was honest. There has never been anything evil between the duke and myself in the past... ...nor was any future evil intended. I am telling you the truth and you must believe me. Is there not something in the tone of a voice which can convince you of that? Mademoiselle Deluzy, I have news for you that will make you speak. - What more can I say? - I advise you to prepare for a shock. I've just received a message. The Duc de Praslin has taken poison. - Oh, no. - Yes, mademoiselle, poison. At this moment, he is dying. The doctor says it's only a matter of hours. To me, it has but one meaning. By this act, he admits his guilt. He has judged and condemned himself. But to you, it must have a frightful significance... ...and I ask you to consider it well. Plainly, mademoiselle, he deserts you. He seeks for himself to evade the justice his conscience made him fear. He takes a coward's course. You alone he leaves to suffer the aroused anger of the people of France. I call upon you in this moment... ...to soften, if you can, the consequences to yourself. Admit the sinful passion that led to the murder. Denounce this man who betrayed you. Rebuke his cowardice by the courage of your confession. I do not know by what means you have driven him to his terrible act. I do not know if he has, as you say, abandoned me. I can only tell you what I have said before. You drive me to a course I had hoped to avoid. That of taking you to that house and bringing the two of you face to face. - I beg you, monsieur. - Do you wish to speak? Only for him. If he is dying, have at least the pity to let him die in peace. Captain, summon carriages. Order a large guard. It'll be needed. Yes, sir. Sergeant, double your escort. Take the prisoner to the house of the Duc de Praslin. You're not thinking of joining this household, mademoiselle. Heh. You'd not enter this household of your own free will. I did it for mademoiselle all the way over at the park. Raynald looks splendid, mademoiselle. I just wanted to tell you, I love you almost as much as Papa. You know, we never had such a good time before you came. We never had anything like this. Even Papa was never so happy. To be loved as you are in this house is above all bargains. - Well, may we go in now, doctor? - I don't think you should, monsieur. Surely you don't intend to question him now? He's dying. He's in frightful agony. Let us go in. Mademoiselle Deluzy will wait here till we call her. Yes, sir. Monsieur, we come to question you for the last time. I implore you to tell the truth. That your repentance may be as public as your crime has become. I haven't any strength... ...to say anything. It would take such a long time to tell the whole truth. We don't ask the whole truth. We only want a yes or no. Are you guilty of the murder of your wife? To some questions... ...there isn't any yes or no. Your suicide is your answer. We only require a confession of your motive. Was it not your entanglement with Henriette Deluzy... ...that drove you to the madness that possessed you? My... My strength fails me. Some other time. Bring the woman in. Who? Did you...? Did you bring her here? You still have a chance to speak. Bring her in. You go to meet your creator. I beg you not to add further guilt to your soul... ...by shielding another who's guilty with you. Did you love this woman? L... I cannot answer anymore questions. Is not your bodily pain less than the suffering of your soul? - Did you love her? - Will you never be satisfied? I am dying. What more do you want of me? Then the last chance comes to you, mademoiselle. Is there anything you wish to say to this man? There is nothing I need to say. It's useless to try further. Take her away. I've done everything possible to help you... ...but I see it's been in vain. May God have mercy on you. Pierre. Monsieur. Lean close. Listen carefully. We have little time. I want you to tell her something. Why I took poison. She may think that I was afraid. But I wasn't afraid for myself, do you understand? No, monsieur. You should have heard them, even now. "Did you love her? Did you love her?" I couldn't have borne it for long. I would have said it to their faces. "Yes. Yes, I love her. With every drop of blood in me, I worship her. She's my heart, she's my lost soul... ...I've been searching for." They would have sent her to her death. - I'll tell her, monsieur. - Yes. Yes, Pierre, tell her. Say the words that I could never say to her. Perhaps she knew. I think so. I think she knew. They can never harm her now. She was free at last. Free of every prison except that of her memories. And this is what he had come to. A grave in an unconsecrated ground... ... a number on his tombstone such as convicts wear in life. This is all that remained of the noble Duc de Praslin. And their love... ... thwarted in life, twisted into an ugly horror. Well, it had taken his death to give it everlasting life and beauty. Yes, she wished that she might die, but that was not possible. She was alive and she must go on living. A friend with great tenderness talked to her of her future. But what future was there for her in a country where she was hated... ... where the mobs would gladly have torn her apart? And so for the first time he talked to her of a new country. A land far away to which he might arrange to take her. He tried to make her see that it was no longer safe for her to remain in France. He was right. The people were angry, they felt they had many grievances. That the king and the courts could let this wicked woman go... ...was the last straw. So they fought the revolution of 1848 and pulled the king from his throne. It is strange how the fate of one governess could so affect history. Then after many months... ...there came from America a surprising offer of employment. She could not know then that it was her kind friend that had arranged that too. I cannot tell you her emotions... ...as she approached this strange, new country. Suppose the terrible things that she wanted so much to forget should follow her. People can be as cruel in one country as another. They can find copies of old newspapers and stir up what is best forgotten. They can exchange sly glances and whispers. And though perhaps they may mean no harm... ...the ugly story grows and spreads until there is no peace for her. No, not even in America. Oh, please, mademoiselle, don't go on. Well. It is for you to tell me the end of my story. Does this governess deserve to suffer the rest of her life? Or does she earn the right to continue her work... ...in this country where so many before her have found refuge? I thank you. I thank you with all my heart. But you, Emily Schuyler... ...you have said nothing. That surprises me. I thought you would be the first to ask me a question. Uh... I haven't any question, mademoiselle. But, Emily, I'm quite ready to answer anything. No, mademoiselle. No, you needn't tell us anymore. I guess you know how we feel. We're just plain skunks. Emily Schuyler, if Miss Haines heard you say that word... ...we'd be sent home for good. That's what we are and I don't care who hears me say it. I'm going to burn those newspapers... ...and never mention a word to anyone as long as I live. Let's all cross our hearts and hope to die and be cut in little pieces if we do. We're sorry. Mademoiselle, I'm sure Emily didn't mean it. - Oh, please. - I'll never forget this day. Mademoiselle, say that you'll forgive us. - You do, don't you? - Oh, I do. I do. All right, mademoiselle. We will resume our lessons tomorrow. You may not have learned much French today... ...but I think you have learned a little patience and tolerance... ...and that is the same in every language. Hurry now. - We'll see you tomorrow, won't we? - We'll look forward to it. - Oh, dear, dear, mademoiselle. - We're so glad you're with us. Mademoiselle, l... I just wanted to tell you that we love you very much. How long have you been standing there? Long enough to see your triumph. You've won their love for the rest of their lives. - Do you really think so? - Yes. Then I am content with the future. If you could only see into your future... ...you would see that there is so much more there waiting... ...if you'll accept it. The first snow. Then if you looked closely enough... ... the whole rest of the world seemed to be obliterated... ... and shut out. Henriette, there are many kinds of love possible between a man and a woman. And peace and gentleness and companionship... ...are not the least of these. I promised you once that you would find a heaven on this earth... ...and I'm going to keep that promise if it takes a lifetime of devotion.
