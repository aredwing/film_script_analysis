So sell that for a good price and give me! Wait! Here! Take this 200 rupees! This is price for the rickshaw, isn't it? Help for my friend! What is the use of myself as your friend! Don't l have this right too for being friendly with you for these years! There is a duty for you! lf l die suddenly, you'd do my funeral! That expense is for you only! Not for anyone else!

How will it be if great people stop good things with the meeting? Shouldn't we fallow these! You used to tell me that l'd not see differentiation as poor and rich and caste! Are those lies? Why you're not answering father! Should he answer immediately? lt's respect for father only if he answer after 10 seconds! ls it not father? Nothing dad! ls my ln-law is a rickshaw man? O.k. Ask that lucky girl and his uncle to come and meet me! Father! We only should go and meet them father! What are you telling man! Don't get angry father! Ammu's uncle has got more self-respect! When he came to know that l'm rich, he told her not to talk with me father! That girl then? Ammu treats him like her God! So she refused to meet me! Did she refuse to see you knowing that you're a millionaire's son? Then why should we go and see her? Shouldn't we show them that we're cultured people who thinks rich as dangerous tiger. So, we'd go and ask for bride father. What do you feel father? l'll think over it! l'll think over! Elder man! Don't stand here! Go! Wait sir! Poor girl is getting degree! l'll see that and go! Who?

Your son has spoken that already! That is... l've told that it won't happen! They love each other! They'll love! What will these children know about life? Elder persons call tell good and evil, can't they! l taught my daughter good... ...things only! l never taught bad things! lf what you tell as good becomes... ...bad for children? ln that case! Do you think that it is good for my daughter... ...to marry a billionaire's son? ls it not? lt won't fit sir! Rich and poor can't live! ln that too, you're rich by hereditary.

We don't have cash locker... ...or money! But we've love in full of our heart! There may be! But your talk shows that the affection of father & stepfather are different! Only parents know that the child is in hungry when it cries continuously and... ...it is in stomach pain when it cries in irregularly! Others won't know! ln that case, do you think that l won't know the need of my Ammu? You won't know! Definitely you won't! Billionaire Vedhachalam, when... ...he came to know that his son loves a girl, he has come to a rickshaw man's... ...hut to engage her! That is the fatherly affection!

His dead mother wanted my only son's marriage to take place... ...in a best manner! l want to make this as she wished! You're a great man! Do what you think as correct for your status! Coming Friday is a good day! Prem's mother birthday! We'll conduct the marriage on that day! You accept for this marriage, don't you? You haven't asked her consent from whom you'd get the consent! Mam! Come out! Mam! Sir wants to ask something from you! Ask sir! Mam! l've decided to make you daughter to marry my son! What's your opinion? All should happen according to her uncle's wish! ln-law! What do you tell! Yes! Shouldn't l see my future daughter-in-law? l'll call! l'll call! Then, l'll make a move ln-law! l'll make a move Mam! What ln-law!

Consider me as a mad! What is there in that! You'd go to marriage and bless my Ammu with your golden heart! Will you do? For me! l'll do Babu! l'll do! Come Mam! Come! Come! Ammu! Your friend has come! Here! Mam! See who has come! All these are my mother's jewels! Father asked me to give this to you! See whether you like! Uncle! Ammu! They've come uncle! To depart me from you! They've come uncle! Mad! Who can depart us? l'm outside in sight! This Babu will be there in your heart permanently! You'd not cry! Go and get your father's blessing! Go! Come! Sit! There is nothing with your uncle to give as gift! Small gift! Have this in memory of me! Dog child! Grateful animal! Even if it is near waste basket, if it sees its owner, it'll bark and show its relation. Only thankful animal. Here! Wear this new dress! Spending 1000s or lighting camphor spending 5 paise for god is same! This is what l can do to this human God! Wear this! l'll wear! l'll wear later! Give uncle! l'll take that! No dear! No!

Come this side! l'll see her marriage and go! You're showing affection like your own daughter! Food only, isn't it? They'll provide you! He says that it is time! What do you tell? Why are you starving for food like this! Like catching place in the cinema theatre! There is food for everybody! Eat slowly! Old man! You too go and sit comfortably! He's tied wedding rope! Bride and groom will put meals with their hand! You too wish them heartily! Uncle! Uncle! No! l'm not her uncle! Don't believe this! l'm a poor man! Rickshaw man! There is no relation between this girl and me! Uncle! Does it mean that there is no relationship if you sit in beggars place without sitting in the marriage hall? You sent me off my saying bye! ls that wish or sending me out of your home? What does that mean? Tell me uncle! What meaning? That means that he wants to get goodness and want us to get sin! He treated your father's love as a liability! He's settled that! Mam! l didn't treat that as a liability Mam! Can poor come among great people? Why can't! Money only has the differentiation as poor and rich! Not for love! There is signal light! ls there separate light for car and rickshaw? You ran and worked hard for this girl! Why man! ls she your daughter why do you work hard for her? When l asked so you told that Ammu is my dear, my soul and l'll work like this until l die! And now you're going like an unknown person! ls this fair! You didn't bless them! You're putting fire on their stomachs! You tell me! Don't l have affection? l didn't come to this marriage as no dishonor should come to my daughter who is going to marry a rich man! Can l make queen to sit on the thrown and spoil by standing nearby? You know, don't you? You may justify your act! But, did you see how many lovable hearts are suffering? This good man is standing in an ordinary costume by doing invaluable goodness! l treat him as a great man! Sir! Your hands are Gangues river! Your feet are like holy shrines! l'm seeing your image as a temple sir! We feel proud that we lived with you! lf you come and wish, it is like the wish the God! Come! Come and wish them without refusing! Sir! l'm lonely! Sick man! Old man! lf you ask me to wish, l don't know to talk even four words too. You'll get fruit if you stand under fruitful tree! l'm a dried tree! You're asking me to wish! Even if there is a gold lamp, the wick is in thread only! Our children may be gold! lf you don't bless them as a wick how can there be brightness in their life! Come! Bless them! Uncle! Don't set me apart uncle! Don't set me apart! Come! Come! Stand this side! See! Bless us telling that we'd live well! Bless us uncle! This is a promise on me! Are there number of loving hearts around me? God! This Babu didn't ask you anything so far! God! You gave light to my eyes! You gave strength to my hands and gave guts to my heart! With the power that you gave l've done my duty properly! Now l'm standing by losing light, strength and guts! Lord! l'll go off! But you'll be here! Whatever good l'll do to my children by being alive, you'd do that! That is enough for this Babu! God! l'm very happy now! My heart is filled! God! Uncle!
