No. - Then he's in the sauna. He isn't there either. - Maybe he went to the bar. To meet Raisa. - That's what I'm afraid of. You'd better hurry before an old man steals your woman. You're late. - Damn it! Go! And don't come home drunk! BROTHERS Hi. - Hello. Lunch is over. Would you like to have... - I'll have tea. It's not brewed. - That's okay. I'd like to talk to you for a moment. - Sure. You want milk? - No thanks. How much? - 1.50. It's on the house. Let's sit over there. I'll take a break if it's okay. Katja. - Raisa. I'm here because of Mitja. Has something happened to him? - No. Well... Yes. He's ruining his life. I want to be frank with you. I know. I know. - You know what? I know Mitja is cheating on me with you. Mitja is just a friend. There's nothing between us. Mitja is my fianc. We're engaged. I know. And I want to congratulate you. What's the problem? I thought I'd come here and you'd understand. You understand, right? - I do. Mitja is cheating on me with you. You don't have to feel threatened by me. - I don't. I don't have any plans or anything. - You're his good friend, right? Why do you sleep with him then? We were friends before you got engaged. It was nothing serious. I don't have any plans. I'm not going to take Mitja from you. Can't you leave him alone? Can't you? Can't you? To be honest with you, I couldn't care less about him. Hello. Can you take this woman, your fiance, - and get the hell out! You're making a scene at my work, you monkeys! - Don't yell. Why are you here? - I need to talk to Raisa. About what? - This isn't working. Why can't you just tell her? And you call yourself a man. - Raisa. Katja, I can't live with you. Katja, I can't live with you. - Why not? Because I have to have such high morals all the time. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm my father's son. - Oh, please. Katja darling, don't go. Katja darling, let's talk and sort this out. Don't touch me. - Katja darling, wait. I'll explain. I didn't mean it. - I know. Get in the car. I don't want Raisa to hear... - I love you. Everything's alright. Let's go. Ivar. Ivar. It'll be a minute. Ivar, dammit it. Unbelievable. - It looks so different here. There used to be a bank and an auto shop here. I bought Vaseline for my bike there. - I'm so happy you came. I need my big brother. Let's have a drink. How are you after all these years? Pour us two beers, will you? I won't serve you. - I'm just joking. He's welcome. You're not. - This is my big brother. Ivar, this is Raisa. - Hello, Raisa. A beer? I won't sell you anything. - Raisa... God dammit! I told you to stay out. Look at this. Oh, a golf course. - That was Paavo's crazy idea. He thinks he's going to make money on it. There were 70 hectares of farmed land here. - If not more. They had a greenhouse and sold vegetables to the villagers. Everything was sold. Are there still workers here? - No. A golf course. And the house looks like it's dying. We might have to sell it, too. - Why? Paavo hasn't told us why. I'm glad you're here. We'll sort everything out. Look at how he's kept the house. Paavo, wake up. You have a visitor. Hello, Father. Ivar. You're in good condition. What would kill an old beast like me. What are you doing here? I'm here to celebrate a special day. June 30th. You remembered. I wanted to visit you and see how you are - now that you're turning 70. That's a hell of a good thing. Hell of a good thing. These guys won't remember anything. Welcome home. Ivar, dammit. - It's been 25 years. How's Gunilla? - She's okay. She's alive? - Yes. She lives near Stockholm. She's well? Lives in the same nursing home - where she worked as a cook. She can no longer work. I see. She is a wonderful woman in so many ways. Really? - Oh, yes. We have to celebrate this. - Absolutely. You have something to drink? - I'm sure you want to freshen up. Torsti! Look who's here. Did you know Ivar was coming? - No, I didn't. Hi, Torsti. - Hi. What brought you here? - Well... Good to see you. - I didn't recognize you. You look the same. - You look more manly. What do you do here? - I keep an eye on Father. I make sure he doesn't drink. Torsti, show Ivar where he can settle in. I hope I'm not disturbing you. - Oh, no. This is your home. I was thinking we'd have dinner and drink - since it's your birthday. We'll talk. There are things in the past, - and we could all lighten our loads. - It sounds... There is a load indeed. You're the father. - And we are the sons. We're a family after all. - Torsti will make a cake. That's a great idea. We've never had a party before. I'll make a cake. Mitja, there will be booze. We'll make a toast once you've settled in. - Sure. It's been some time, but I'll find my way. Ivar. Come to the sauna when you've settled in. Paavo. We should talk. - What the hell have we got to talk about? We have unfinished business. - I don't have any. I'm not trying to pick a fight. Let's sort these things out. You always want to pick a fight. You always did. I'm asking you nicely. Let's talk. - Not now. First things first. It's my birthday after all. You don't care. You didn't even remember. Ivar did. Dammit, I'm turning 70 tomorrow. - Hard to believe. Damn you! You remember these stairs, don't you? - Yes. This is your room. This? I remember this. There was a bunk bed here, another one there. We sat and played games here. You still have a rope ladder here? - No rope ladder. We used it a lot. - Yes. On many nights. Great memories. I didn't spend that many nights here, though. Paavo drove me away like he did the rest of us. He was afraid of us. - He was afraid of us boys. Boys turn into men. He had nothing to worry about. He knew his worth. Those are your old books. - Let's see. We took the best ones to the antique book store. James Bond The Man with the Golden Gun. Applied philosophy. How has your life gone? - Well... I have trodden upon this Earth. I've spent the last years in Germany. You've made it. You're educated. - It's nothing. You've lived abroad. It doesn't mean anything. - It doesn't? How is your mother? - My mother died 15 years ago. She had cancer. She went quickly. She wanted to spend her last days here, - but Paavo wouldn't let her in. "Get the fuck out of here, you whore!" he said. That's what he did to all of our mothers. Used them and drove them away. How's your mother? She lives in her own world, in her own reality. She walks the streets of Vaxholm, afraid that Paavo will come. The last time I saw her, she was wearing a bag on her head. He's done a lot of harm. Why don't you pull yourself together and take charge? You know what I'm waiting for? I'm waiting for the old man to die. Then I'll fix this place up. I don't want the others to hear. - It might take years. No, it won't. He's been drinking two years straight. He sold some land and spent the money. He was living at the casino at one point, - playing and drinking. Enjoying life. - In other words. Mitja is all messed up, too. He came here a couple of months ago. - What does he do? I don't know. - Films? He's trying to. His last film was a disaster. He shot it abroad. It was expensive. He's in debt? - I'm sure. Has Paavo financed these projects? - I think so. Even though Mitja got his mother's share of the inheritance. So Paavo has given Mitja his share? - Yes. So our share of the inheritance is vanishing? Yes. The old man is drinking it. That's why I hope he dies soon. There was enough money to buy a couple of houses, right? - Yes. That's what I figured. Then there's the Russian girl at the bar. Both of them are chasing her. Mitja and Paavo? - Yes, father and son. They fight all the time. The girl could be linked to the mafia. What if he leaves this all to her? - He wouldn't do that, would he? Who knows. Has he said so? - He's not human anymore. He's an animal. Be happy. You'll get a new stepmother. Thanks a lot. So this is what's going on here. The last two years have been pure hell. Pure hell. I'm his slave. I feed him... - Why do you put up with it? Because I refuse to leave this place. - What happened to your pride? Your principles, all that we talked about. What happened? - Good question. I still have hopes and dreams. I'm not that old. A golf course. - I'll bear with it, - and then I'll make something nice out of this. That's the plan. I can't understand how they could let a place like this get rundown. You have a family? - No, I don't. And I never will. I've seen the two run after that girl. There's no way I'll ever bring some slut into this house. How's your health? You look well. Do I? - Yes, you do. You can't see anything? - You have something? No. No. I just mean it's great to see that you're well. I sometimes have epileptic seizures. - You have epilepsy? You didn't know? - No. You didn't have it back then. I developed it as an adult. - I see. We all have our crosses to bear. Don't get scared if something happens. It'll pass. Just so you know. - You mean, if you have a seizure? So this is hell. The old man is an animal and Mitja is a bloodsucker. And then there's the Russian girl. I'll go make the cake. Raisa honey. Me. It's me. Paavo. ANT POISON You want to know why I called you? I wanted to invite you to a party. You would make it special. Could you come around ten? Wear a pretty dress. You know what I mean. I know you can. Well, see you at ten then. Bye bye, Raisa honey. Did you call that Russian girl? - I called Raisa. Ivar is here. You haven't seen him in years. None of us has. And you want to invite whores. Listen. - Thanks a lot. Torsti, the situation is this: I have a little surprise for you boys. In honor of my 70th birthday, - I'll surprise you all. I hope you'll have a positive attitude. You've surprised us plenty of times over the years. Torsti, you have such a serious attitude toward life. How many people will I set the table for? - Six. No, seven. You boss me around. First it's four people, then six. Make another cake. You're so good at whipping eggs. You have a weak left arm. It must be like a snake. Your left arm is made of paper. Our father Deliver me from evil Your love of money brings upheaval And makes you mean Ivar. Come swim with me. - Oh no. It's really warm. It feels so nice. - There might be muskrats. This is wonderful. Come. - No, I won't. Have a beer then. I'm a new man. Tonight we'll drink and sing until morning. There are so many questions I want to ask you. I can hear the highway. Yes, it's been over there a couple of years. Too bad we have to give this place up. What? We have to sell it. - Why? You've seen the shape the house is in. Besides, I need money. I'm working on the project of a lifetime. I'll make my mark in Finnish film history. Did you hear about it? Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche will be in my next film. I don't have their names on paper yet, - but it's all agreed. I need money to get the project started. How much money does Paavo have? Look at all this land and the house. They must be worth millions. But I don't know where he's put the money. Ask him, okay? Are you interested in this? - Yes. Torsti told me you already got financing from Paavo. Quite a bit of financing. That's nonsense. He doesn't know. - So it's not true? I got some money, - but not even enough to cover my mother's share. Everything here was bought with Elina's money. This is my mother's family estate. I should get... If we split this fifty-fifty... - Fifty-fifty? With who? You and I will split this. If we sell this... Torsti is entitled to his share, too. Legally he isn't. Why not? Paavo hasn't acknowledged him as his son. What about your and Katja's child? He's grown up, isn't he? What does he do? Is he studying? Katja miscarried in the fifth month. She never gave birth. It happened shortly after you left. Katja and I lived together for some time. Then I left the country, and we broke up. We got back together just a couple of months ago. What does Katja do? - She's a psychiatrist or a psychologist. A youth psychologist. - You live together? Yes, at the moment we do. But I will move into the sauna soon. I can't live with Katja. I have to be so damn lofty with her. I'm my father's son, after all. Katja... Katja... Katja would be good for you. You would be right for each other. You have that loftiness in you. You have the noble personality Katja needs. I'm a rogue. You had a crush on her, didn't you? What's so funny? All these years. I'm so happy you came. - We're brothers. You're like an angel to the rescue. We have the best possible father. I'll talk to him. Please do. - I will. Hello. - Hello. How are you, pastor? Whisk and you shall be rewarded. Where is he? - In his bedroom. Valdemar! Valdemar. Valdemar, dammit! I'm glad you could come. I'm on holiday. - You're tan. Did you pass out in the sun in your garden? - Oh no. I was fishing on the pier and fell asleep. I hope you have all the necessary props with you. Voil. - Voil. That's what the Russians say. Torsti! - Yes? Bring glasses, will you? This is it. - It's God's grains. Here you are, you swine. - Thank you. Just kidding. First things first. Where is my love? This damned life. To Georg Ots. Not that I want to, but I have to make a decision tonight - if I still want to enjoy life. You're an old friend. I know you will support me. - You can count on me... You know what, Valdemar? ... like Pontius Pilate. Now that Ivar is here, - I realize 25 years have passed, and I haven't seen him. I thought, who's that old man? He's my son. Dammit! Time goes so fast. Man doesn't get old. Time just goes by. - That's right. I realized it and thought, is this my life? Is this everything? I've been married, no happiness. My wives were terrible. My first wife. A whore. Gunilla. Ivar's mother. A real slut. My second wife was a hysteric. Mitja's mother. She was paranoid and crazy. She would be on my back all the time, nagging. Throwing fits. I didn't have a single day of rest. And my third wife, Torsti's mother... Oh, Torsti. - That's enough. Torsti, why are you always so serious? He takes everything so seriously. - No sense of humor. Spade. - Clubs. I need my glasses. - Grog glasses. Speaking of which... Even though we haven't met that often, - I see that we have the same darkness in us. The same blackness. I'm basically a happy person. There's no great sorrow, but I have the same darkness. We're our father's sons. - Where do you think it comes from? I don't know. I can just see it in you. Are you able to deal with it? - Yes, but it still startles me. I once had an affair with a woman. It was just a harmless fling. We ended it, and then one day the doorbell rang. I opened the door, - and there was a man standing in the rain. He looked disturbed, and he was holding a gun. He didn't threaten me with the gun or anything. He came in, sat in an armchair - and told me to sit down. I sat down at the desk so that I could escape - if he started shooting. But he just sat there, with the gun in his hand. He pointed the gun at the ceiling - and then put it on the desk. He said I'd ruined his life. It was the woman's husband. He walked out and left the loaded gun on the desk. It's still on my desk. Somehow it has... Somehow it has made me love life more than ever. I'm more present in the moment. But there is that darkness. Through my work, - I try to create these golden reflections. Imagine a polluted harbor basin in the city. It's full of waste, yet when the sun hits the water, - you'll see golden reflections. I'm floundering in the basin, - trying to create these golden reflections. And I feel Father pulling me down to the bottom. Does that sound... Does that sound stupid? - No. Does it sound familiar? Youth flies by Where is my love? You're in a party mood already. I'm glad you came. Unbelievable. - Ivar. The great connoisseur of Byzantine history. Which hallowed ground do you come from? What a reunion. You're here. - I've been here six years. Torsti, bring us chairs. Unbelievable. You've lost your hair. - That's right. It's so great to see you. - Sit down, boys. I have something to tell you. We were supposed to study - at the Martin Luther University in Berlin. I was too lazy to study. Reuben, Simon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Asher... I got caught cheating on the exam. - Will you serve us drinks? Ask Torsti. - I'll bring wine. Valdemar, we need to discuss family affairs. Valdemar is family. - I'm like a family member... I invited him. - I'm here more than in my own house. You are my brothers. He's my son just as you are. - Unbelievable. Besides, Valdemar has an important role - in tonight's surprise. Dear members of the congregation, dear Father. It's the time for red wine. - Sounds promising. The altar wine has been drunk. If you don't mind, I'd like to tell you a story. When I was a young pastor, - I walked to the church to preach a sermon one Sunday. There were three young guys on the steps, playing cards. They were drunk, and had bottles in their back pockets. In my sermon, I asked who could save us from our sins. That's when I heard one of the guys' happy voice: "Hearts are trumps. " And they toasted to that. You haven't changed. - Father. Torsti. - Boys. Ivar. My brother. My dear brother. - Brothers. A bit too much aftertaste. - Ivar wants to say something. We should sort certain things out before we start celebrating. It's great to see a school friend and former colleague. Mitja, what things do you want to sort out? There are a few things we need to sort out. Ivar. Yes, it was my wish that we'd sit down, drink and enjoy. And have an open conversation. I also have something important to tell you. Maybe this is the right time. I'm tense and curious, said Jesus on the cross. My dear sons, Valdemar. It is not good for man to be alone. Man was not created to be alone. God dammit, I don't believe this. - It's true. What do you mean, Father? I mean that I can feel it in my heart. Man was not created to be alone. Man needs... You really think she'll say yes? To an old playboy like you? Are you serious? - Your words are like flies buzzing in my ears. He's a little upset. He's always been hot-tempered. You're getting married? He thinks he's getting married. This is the decision I've made once again. Let's toast to that. To Father's happiness. To love. - To love. - To love. The greatest of them all is love. Father. - Yes? Who is she? Raisa... - Your father invited me. Raisa, is it true? Did you say yes? Raisa honey. My lovely pig! My birthday boy! Happy birthday! How come your father is so cute? Are you serious? - I brought birthday flowers and everything... I brought cookies. - Did you say yes to him? My favorite cookies. - No one has said yes to anybody. Russian girl, you want to sit down? - Torsti! Please, sit here, at my right hand. Where is Katja? - Sit here. Raisa. - Where's your fiance? The one you ran after. She's not my fiance. - It's wonderful that you came. Of course I came. My birthday boy. - Oh, fuck. Everybody's drunk here. - "We'll get married. " You old fucking stud. We should have castrated you. Where's your sense of humor? - He'll kill him! We should've locked you away in an institution. A toast to love. - Our father's love illuminates us all. Let's toast to that. Well said. - To lovely Raisa. To beauty and love. - The greatest of them all is love. To life! Father. I have a gift for you. It's a little story I made up. The story is set in the Polish countryside, - in a village that later became known as Auschwitz. Christ grows tired of people's sinful ways - and decides to show himself. He appears in Auschwitz on the day - they are going to kill the children. The parents accept this, as they get a few more days to live. The children scream as they are taken to the gas chamber. The children stare at the steel frame on the ceiling, - knowing what's ahead. The children hunch down on the floor, - afraid of the gas that spreads through the room. That's when they hear Christ's voice. "Do not fear, for I am with you. " The children turn to look at Jesus, reaching their arms out for him. They say, "Save us, Christ. Save us. " And Christ, the Son of God, says: "Rise. Come to me and I'll save you. " The children run to Jesus, - except for one little girl still lying on the floor. Christ says to her, "Little girl. " "Rise. " But the girl doesn't get up. All the children look at her, hoping they will be saved. But the girl starts talking. "If you are Christ, - you wouldn't have led us to the gas chamber. " "I don't believe you. " "I don't believe in you. You're not the son of God. " The children turn to look at Jesus, but he's gone. We hear a bang from the steel frame. Zyklon B gas, which is meant to kill people in a minute, - starts spreading through the gas chamber. The children scream. The lights go out. The oldest children rush to the door, - climbing over one another, trying to save themselves. A horrible struggle of life and death begins. They cling to each other and scream. The lights go out. The strongest climb over the smallest ones. It takes a long time before it's silent. Father. I brought you a gift. Thank you. Thank you. A horrible story. Why did you tell that on his birthday? - Katja. Oh, cognac... My angel, sit down. You came at the right time. I also have a gift. - Katja, sit here. I'm sure she'll want to sit next to her fianc. Raisa, we'll talk later. - Certainly. I also have a gift for you. I don't know how to give speeches. I made a song for you. - Paavo, congratulations. Happy birthday. - Don't take it out, please. I want to sing you a song. I'm no singer or songwriter. My job is to produce films, but I wrote you a song. This was written by an amateur, but listen to the words. Our father You're in our life like mud in a spring You stain and poison everything Everything, each and everything Our father Deliver me from evil Your love of money brings upheaval and makes you mean You're on me like a wet blanket Listen, Paavo. Our father Have mercy on me Have mercy on us Leave us, take your sins with you Vanish, die! Die, dammit! My sons, my lovable sons. Raisa darling, my little Raisa. At this lovable moment - when I could say I feel love flowing towards me, - I want and feel the need to ask you to be my wife. Fuck! I don't believe this. Damn you! You should be sent to an institution and castrated. - Come on. You've never been responsible for your actions. I mean it. Stop! - I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Violence breeds violence. - That's right. So jealous. - Let's forget all this ranting and raving - because there is love amidst all this. Mitja! You're intoxicatingly beautiful. So? - What is Mitja doing? What about him? Is he still in a bad mood? - You know Mitja. Raisa darling. May I ask you to come with me. - Of course. I apologize for my sons' behavior. Come here. This is what it's been like the whole time. And I meant what I just said. I'm serious. I'm asking you to be my wife. For better or for worse, - I will love and help you in every way possible. I will protect you and be gentle to you. I promise. Oh, Paavo. - Raisa honey. You know how much I like you. Your words are so beautiful. Raisa. - I have to think about this. It came so suddenly. And there's the age difference. Father is a clown. He's been doing this show all his life. I'm afraid Mitja will do something to him. He doesn't have the guts. Why do you say that? - He doesn't have the strength. It takes a different kind of man. A heavier hand, a darker mind and determination. Mitja doesn't have the strength. He's not a man who would do such a thing. And even if he did, - human life has no meaning, - considering where we live, this circle of life. All aspects of life. The end of a human life is as meaningful - as the end of a mosquito's buzz. It is totally meaningless to this planet. Of course we all fight for our lives. But if we look for a meaning in this, - we won't find it in money. It's somewhere else. It's not in the way people live here. What's the value of living like an insect? What's the value? - The thought is just so awful. The thought of ending someone's life. Well, I don't think it's a solution. Nothing will be solved. It's a cheap... You don't want to be weak. You should have the guts to... I've tried to think and find a way to live... I feel thoughts are just shadows of our emotions. We live so strongly according to our emotions. We do what feels best at the moment. All my life I've analyzed and pondered - at where I've ended up. In loneliness, in desperation. If there is no love in life... If there is no love... What are you doing? I just want to scare him. For once, let me do this my way. I trust you. Katja, let me go. Let go of what? - Let's cut this rope between us - before we strangle ourselves. What rope? What do you want to cut? You can do what you want, but don't do anything stupid. When I'm free, you'll have freedom too. Why should I be free? What are you trying to say? You've always loved someone else. Right? You can't hide it. You've always loved Ivar. Mitja. Don't do anything stupid. Mitja. Ivar... Mitja! I'd like to give a word of advice to the young couple. It says in the Bible that there is nothing love cannot face, - but there are things it can't. I'll tell you a story. Do as I say, not as I do. I bought a human-drawn plow from a flea market. I was thinking my wife and I would plow our potato field. One pulls the plow while the other stands behind it. I thought I'd be a gentleman and do the pulling. Everything went well, except that the furrow was crooked. It was like Hebrew writing. Sugar for the old man. Torsti, you have outdone yourself. - Just a plain strawberry cake. We switched places. - Looks delicious. I went to the back, and my wife got in front of the plow... We'd plowed for a week... - Oh, spoons. I want to apologize. Let's party as if nothing happened. I lost my temper. - Exactly. - It happens. Torsti, take a photo. We have to document this party. Take a photo of me with Father. How do you turn this on? I can't see anything. My missus said... - Valdemar, shut up, will you? Cake, anyone? Cake for the birthday boy? - Ivar, come and have cake with us. Oh my. - Oh yes. I'm sure no one wants coffee, right? It's bad luck to trip a piece of cake over. There are no strawberries in the pastor's piece. - He'll be fine. She said she'd go away for the summer... The cake is delicious. - Thank you. Torsti outdid himself. So sweet! It's been two years. Father... I would like to say... - Do you like the cake? ...that the way you made your women suffer - and destroyed them... Listen, Father. You didn't let Torsti's mother come here - and spend her last days with her son. You drove my mother into madness. And then there's the car accident we all know about. This cake is, indeed, sweet. God dammit, it's sweet. I have it all written here. You sent two men to threaten my mother. "They said they were going to bang my head against the stove. " This is a court document. You're a pervert. That's nonsense. You, like the rest of us, are made of moving atoms. Since there is no God, - you have the right to do as you please. But... Stop, for God's sake. - Wait, Father. That's why I won't leave you anything. My mother was never the same. - God dammit! Stop! - Apologize! Apologize! Stop! - Mitja! Fucking hell! - Don't kill him! My chest hurts! Wait. A heart attack! For God's sake! Everything I said... I can't breathe. - Let's get out! Go get Ivar. Ivar! Go ahead! - Paavo's arm is getting numb! Put the gun away. - Why won't you let me do it? Put it away. - It would've solved everything. No, it wouldn't have. Please forgive me. I was just teasing you. I was so stupid. Please forgive me. Mitja. - I would've killed myself if you had married him. I wouldn't have married him. I did it because of Katja. I was so stupid. I love you so much. Raisa. Raisa darling. Lovely Raisa. I'll take you away. Let's leave this place. Hell is waiting for you. Hell is waiting for you. Did you really think I'd die that easily? Soon you will. We'll have cognac and eat some cake. Everything will be fine. Damn you boys. - I don't feel good. Life wins, Torsti. Life wins. You showed me your true... Dammit. He's shaking. He's an epileptic! An epileptic! Valdemar, come here! Come and see what's shaking here. He's having an epileptic seizure. Put something in his mouth, - or the police will interrogate us. What a disgusting heap. Damn, that's gross. And drag him out of here. - I'll turn him on his back. On his back so that he won't swallow his tongue. Drag him out! Are you out of your mind? Are you? No? Please forgive me. You think you're better than everyone else? What right do you have? You see what's happening? Some responsibility. You have to take responsibility for your actions. Listen. I came here because I wanted to celebrate a reunion. I wanted to see my father and my brothers - after such a long time. You did a fine job. - Listen for a moment. When I saw the state they live in... ...you decided to... Who do you want to kill? No. It brought back memories of what I've been through. And you decided to get even. - I didn't mean to. You didn't? You just happened to pull out the court document? How dare you lie to me? Katja. I just wanted to get rid of the revenge, - all the blackness I've carried with me. - Great. Listen. - No! I was getting to the part where I'd say nicer things. You're a bullshitter. You only use your head. What's wrong with that? - What? I'm trying to think. - People follow their heart. Look at your brother! - I wouldn't have gotten rid of all this shit... You have a lot to learn from Mitja. He is what he is... Mitja is miserable. - And you are evil. I'm not. - You are. You come and vomit on others. Mitja follows his dick. He follows his heart. Mitja doesn't use his head. People who use their heads are Hitlers. They do their devilish things. Ivar, what happened to you? I can see you're the same. I feel dizzy. What? Did a thought interrupt you? No, memories. It was a thought. - No, it wasn't. All that we talked about, all that we debated. Don't you remember? - No. You're still as unrelenting as ever. You have the same madness. What happened to you? What? Maybe I died. You don't have to die. You don't have to kill yourself because you're already dead. Wake up. When I saw you, something happened. I realized that I've missed you all these years, 25 years. I was a teacher, and you were my student. Every time I saw you in class, I was happy. I could only think of you. I had to restrain myself from looking at you. I loved you. You loved me. You were fond of me. I lit a fire in you. Not only with my words, but with me. Don't say I didn't. When you chose Mitja, I had to leave. You killed me. I feel sick to my stomach. I didn't mean to. Or I don't know what I meant, but I didn't mean to. One night I was home alone. I had never drunk before. I turned fifteen the next day. I went to my parents' liquor cabinet. I filled a beer glass with different types of liquor. I closed my nostrils and drank it all. Being drunk was exactly as I had imagined. I ran into a wall because I thought it was a door. My friend Lotta came. We drove off in her car. We drove to the village and went to a party. And... I passed out. I woke up - to a man having sex with me. Then Mitja came in. He wanted to kill the man. He's taken care of me ever since. And then I found out I was pregnant. From that first time, from the first time I got drunk. Mitja said - he would be a father to the child. And Mitja came to my father - and told him he was my boyfriend. He said the baby was his - and asked for my hand in marriage. He said we would marry. And then - I miscarried in the fifth month. Mitja came to get me from the hospital. He did a beautiful thing. - Yes, he did. Now I understand what kind of a man Mitja is. Deeply desperate. But money isn't bothering him. It's something else. It seems that he prevents himself - from becoming what he could be. Both Torsti and Mitja say they need money. What about you then? Don't you want money? I thought I would help my mother with the inheritance. I would make her life comfortable. Well, there is no money. What do you mean? - There is only debt. How do you know? - Veikko told me. Your father? - He's still the manager of the bank. There is no money at all, only debt. He gambled it all away. Well, it's a relief for all of us. One more question. You still have the necklace I gave you? No. No, I don't. Ivar! Would you really have killed Paavo - if I had gotten married to him? Paavo or myself. You realize how sexy that is? And romantic. Mitja. He doesn't have any money. - Paavo? Nothing but debt. The house will be auctioned. How do you know? - Katja told me. I can't believe it. - It's true. Katja's father is the bank manager. - Fucking hell! Why did you have to come back? Why? Go get Raisa. Ask Raisa to come in. How can I get a ride to the city? Torsti. Mitja is possessed. Raisa, let's get out of here. What did you do? You killed him. - I just taught him a lesson. He's lying on the floor dead. Valdemar? - No, Father. Father! Dammit! What have you done? Torsti. Ivar. What are you staring at? I won't admit anything. I'll never admit anything. Mitja will be blamed for this, and for good reason. I feel perfectly fine. I've been lying here the whole time - after I had a seizure. I feel so good. I feel so good. I feel perfectly calm and balanced. Besides, you're just as guilty as anyone else. You said that human life is no more important - than a mosquito's life. All it takes is a strong human being. I'll stay here. See you. And thank you. I found a dead bird. I think it's best we call the police. Directed, edited and produced by MIKA KAURISMKI
