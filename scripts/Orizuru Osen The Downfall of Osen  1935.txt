Please wait for a while! We sincerely apologize! Please wait for a while! Power outage for all trains! North-bound ones are out! South-bound broke down! On top of this downpour, all trains out of service! Such a terrible downpour, Professor! You reckon? Bet that cosmopolitan beauty has today off from a nearby bordello! Beautiful snow-white skin with alluring hair and neckline! Quite a vamp! Bet poison got to her brain. A beauty brought to her ruin. What a pity! Such rumors being whispered in the background while a man stares in the direction of the forest of Kanda Shrine in this rainstorm. Sokichi. Study hard there. The woman who is being rumored about is sitting inside the stuffy waiting room. She too stares in the direction of the forest. Wait! Don't do anything rash! Running away like that! Seriously! Miss, come back with us. Watch it! Get lost, you loser! Damn it! He drew his sword! Guys, take her! Quick! Come, Miss Osen. Let's go back. They're no threat! Forget about them. Come back home with me. Alright? Excuse me, sir? Sir? Oh, thank you. TRADITIONAL ART OFFICE Home, sweet home, eh? Osen? Why so grumpy? Making me your prey again, huh? Hold your temper. Listen to your man. Trick them nicely and fully. We need all the money we can get. It's starting to get out of hand. I'll go buy some time with the client. Once we get the money, Amaya, you play the antique dealer. Got it? Who's this little stripling? Oh this? Just some stray dog Miss Osen brought back. Move it! You dumbo! She's a rare find! A true beauty! She's very happy to have found favor with you. As I mentioned before, the client is in Sendai. It could be Taiwan or Hokkaido, as long as the money is right. That's all! It all comes down to money. You see, my sister here worked in Sukiyacho entertaining guests just until recently. Please take this. When may I come to take her? She'll be going so far away, so I'd like to show my little sister a bit of Tokyo. Nah, don't worry. I'll bring her within a few days. You surely introduced me to a terrible person! What's this? Something wrong? Trusted Kumazawa with the scroll. I can hardly do temple repairs. Pay us the money or we'll report to the police! Plan to sell it off and walk away? You think you can get away like that? Didn't I tell you enough times that Monk Fuboku needs money urgently? I, Kumazawa, give you my word as a true gentleman. I ask you to please trust me! But he has suffered great misfortune. With the fire that destroyed both his temple and its living quarters. Because he needs money to rebuild the temple, he has gone so far as to sell off temple treasures. We won't take your offer for the Buddha statues, but you must pay us for the scroll! I understand, but he should have delivered the money by now. That antique dealer! So unreliable! Good evening. I apologize for being late. I rushed over to your house with the money. They told me you were here, so I rushed over. Please make sure. The owner of the antique shop Jurakudo. Please excuse us for a moment. How's Osen? Don't worry. Matsuda's got Osen covered. Please reconsider our offer about the statues. They are over there. Amazing! From the Tempyo Period and the Tang Dynasty! I would love to buy them. That'll boost my shop's reputation! But they are very valuable pieces, unlike the scroll earlier. Trust, indeed, is the most important thing here. Come here! Now! Damn it! What a disgrace! How dare you! You rat! You hurt my reputation! Calm down here. Don't be so violent. Don't ever step into my house again! Such a disgrace! It's not that we don't trust you. Calm down. There's nothing we can do if you're so upset. Just that they are very valuable statues. Hey, antique dealer! Stop it! I've had enough! "The greatest despairs is indeed the greatest hope. " I refuse such a preposterous scheme! You can live your life in luxury! They say, "Cheat a monk, you pay for seven generations. " You refusing? Why didn't you shut up and listen from the beginning? Insolent whore! Monk Fuboku has arrived. Welcome. This way, please. No innocent, nave girl gets drunk! Get that? This... is a little unexpected. We're merely giving fate a helping hand here. Where did that worm go? You lazy swine! You dog! Lolling around, eh! We've got a guest. Looks good. Hands off! You scared me! Hey you! Get the bath ready! Is she the sister you were talking about? All I am is a painted-up vixen in disguise! No matter what those heartless people do. Promise me... Promise you won't give up, okay? No matter what happens, I am here to help you, Sokichi. Thank you very much. I have found a mother and a sister in you. What's this, you rat! Shirking work again? Get the bath ready! Now! Get to it, you scum! Please. I will consider it carefully, since it is your sister that we are talking about. She's hardly worthy of you. Please, have a cup. Before that, would you excuse me? The toilet would be...? There, over there. May I humbly ask for your sister's hand? She's not worthy of you, but if you wish. Well, another drink. Here, let me shave. A lunatic with a razor, huh? Don't say that. After all, we do need to make you look as pretty as possible. Hey kid! Get some warm water in a bowl! Show me your face, you urchin! Hold still! I'm far from perfect. But he's good practice. Leave him alone! Come on! What difference does it make? He can lose an eyebrow or two! Then come on! Try shaving off mine first! I'd rather die than do what you people say! Hey! Don't lose your temper at me! Calm down! I'm sorry, I am! Go get changed! Hurry up! '"Everlasting heaven and earth, distant past and present. A man of small figure commits an audacious deed. "' Just completed school this spring, am I right? And now, learning music. Her voice when chanting must be lovely! Come here, over here. This is such a fortunate blessing. With the temple rebuilt soon and such a beautiful bride, I feel very blessed. Hello. What did you come here for, huh! How dare you show up! Come here! No, no, no, hold it for a second. Listen to me. Wait, Mr. Kumazawa. We must remain cordial here. Let's stop this bickering. Please, leave it to me. You've come about the statues, I presume? No need to tell me. Come, over here. Come. Well then. First, have a cup. I have left the matter completely to Mr. Kumazawa here. So rest assured. Our game's on, Osen. Come with me. It's starting to get frosty. You must be freezing. This is a thin kimono. No, I can bear it. I can bear anything. For the sake of Grandma who waits alone for me back home. I dressed your late father in his kimono just as now... when he left for Tokyo to study. Come back a great doctor like your grandfather and father. I know that my tears of joy will bring back light to these old eyes. Grandma, until I come back, you mustn't let anything happen to yourself. Her sweet grandson's first journey. The old woman was forever looking in the direction he left with her blind eyes. Sokichi, study hard and come home once you succeed! Show me some hakama. A bit more discount? It already is a bargain. I see. I'll take it then. Well, just the kimono this time. SAISEl SCHOOL I pray that you can go to school like them soon. I pray, every day. I think we met because your grandma's loving hearth called on me to watch over you like a sister. See you at my place later. Matsuda's wife is perfectly aware of your plans for my sister. Mr. Matsuda gave us 5 yen for carting the statues to Tsukiji from the temple. I can buy the books I nedd now. And go to school from tomorrow! I can't allow you to use this money! You're happy to have got it, but you don't know the whole story. Ill-gotten money. I don't want you to come to harm by using this. I'll manage your tuition... You must return this. Go return it now! Alright, okay. Let's party now! We did it! A great victory! He'll become a great man one day. I can't let him use ill-gotten money. Come here, kiddo! Have a bite. I'm returning this money here. What's that? Here. What for? Keep it! I gave it to you! But... This money is unclean. I don't want it! Huh? You said '"unclean'"? Shut up! You insolent urchin! You impudent bugger! Who do you think you are! We took pity and brought you home, you nasty stray dog! Take this! Now, hold it there. Leave it to me. I've got an idea! Leave it to me. Yeah? You, come over here. Kiddo! Hold still. We'll "enlighten" you! See? '"Enlightened," right? The only way to teach a rotten whelp like him is through food, just like a monkey! That's right! No food for you for the next 4-5 days! I'll teach you a thing or two. How do you like it? Hungry, aren't you? It's good! It's delicious! Dying for a bite? The big job from 10:00! Guys, wrap it up! We know that, Boss. Don't worry! Got that? We know, we do! Fine, that's enough for now. Go buy some rice crackers. Here you go. Here is 10 sen. Go get that famous Soma rice crackers with a bridle-shaped mark! Got it? Then go! Give me some, please. Oh, thank you! I want some! For 2 sen, please! Here you go. Thank you. Forgive me, Grandma! Uh-oh! Oh, it's you. Don't scare us! Give it over here. Two, four, six... That's weird! There isn't enough here! Hey you! You rascal! Where's the remaining You fool! Didn't take you long to do this, did it? So much for the speech on "unclean money"! Well, well... You're a true master at this! Don't try to fool us, you impudent fraud! Your kimono too! Dirty thief! There! '"Talent shows itself right from the start. " So true! No! Wait Sokichi! Forgive me, Osen! I pray for Sokichi's long life and great education. Don't think that it was I who saved you. It's your grandma's single-hearted love that made the gods rescue you. It makes me so sad, feel so helpless Ever since Kumazawa made me his with power, my life has only been a mindless toil. Sold to bordellos, then made to run away. What's more, now I'm forced to commit a heartless deed. Makes one want to die, but even death isn't enough. Even the gods must take pity on such wretched people as us. Sokichi! Wake up, stupid monk! Shut up! As if that's going to get the monk! I won't be preyed on any longer. What's going on? You must be brave, Sokichi! You double-crossing bitch! Do as you like! The lotus flower will take me to Paradise! Dead or alive, no one cared for a rag doll like me! But Sokichi's pure heart has shown me the truth and given me back my soul! From now on, no matter how long or short, I'll live my life with dignity! You saved me from calamity. You have the spirit of a Bodhisattva. Namu Amida Butsu Namu Amida Butsu PAWNSHOP Sorry that I kept you waiting. SAISEl SCHOOL You must be freezing! Don't worry about me. Be off to school! Oh, wait! Have these bean rice cakes on the way. But... I'm fine! Please, you have them. I feel bad. I didn't get to cook you breakfast today. Please, take it with you. You can't possibly study on an empty stomach. Osen scraped money together. She barely paid Sokichi's monthly tuition and saw him off to school. Osen returned home and noticed the lamp as if the last drop of oil was burning out. It started flickering weakly. May Sokichi pass his medical licensing exam soon and live a happy life. That is my only happiness in life. Hello, neighbor. Yes? I take it that you're out of food again, huh? Oh please, don't say that! You hear me now? That's why I'm telling you to... Only if you do as I say. You surely don't have to suffer as bad as this. No initial capital necessary, you know. Yes? You despise it that much? A grand design, isn't it? Send your brother to school while you beg me for food! You rather both starve? Perfect! Lady! Ma'am! You'll listen to me? Then here. Osen, did you grow rich overnight? I told you it's a good profession, didn't I? I didn't prepare supper tonight. Let's go eat out. No, I'll be fine with the bean rice cakes as usual. Osen? Where did these come from? It's... nothing. It'll be horrible if you catch a cold now. Your exams are coming up. You must eat some good food and stay healthy. Come now, let's go. The bill. Eh, huh? What! Pickpocketed! Oh? Take this for now. Please! You must sleep now. I can't possibly sleep. Not while you're studying here. How could I? Could it be the man, who forgot these? Police! What're these! Huh? A devil of a woman! Snooping around like that! My sister would never do such a thing! Osen! Did you really do something wrong? Forgive me, Sokichi. Your breakfast. The cooked beans are there, in the lidded jar, and the pickled ginger... It's covered with a paper lid. Osen! Take care of yourself and study hard! Don't ever lose your heart. Here is my prayer for you. May you rise high in the world, higher than the sky! Hey! I'm sorry! So sorry! Oh, Sokichi Hata! Hey, Hata! Professor! It was indeed where the paper crane fell that Sokichi was saved. We apologize for the delay! The train will depart soon! Medical emergency! Is there a doctor here? Any doctor on this train? Any doctor? There on the train was a doctor working at an internal medicine dept. Of a university hospital who was well known for his deep knowledge and skills. Sokichi Hata. He had just recently returned home. Her pulse is weak. One look at the woman and Sokichi stared at her face in disbelief. There she was, the woman who had... saved his life and took care of him like a parent when Sokichi was 17. Doctor, I'm very sorry but... Osen? Don't you remember me? I'm Sokichi. Sokichi Hata! Brute! Men are brutes! Beasts! What're you doing to my Sokichi? No! Be careful! You forgot about me and your grandma! THE END
