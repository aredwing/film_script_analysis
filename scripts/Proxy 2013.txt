Heartbeat looks good. Just need to get a few measurements here. Now, you did not want to know the sex of the baby, correct? - Mm, no. I'd rather not. - Okay. I honestly don't blame you. If I could do it over again, I wouldn't want to know, either. We were told I was having a girl. Ended up a boy. Had to redecorate the nursery, return all the shower gifts. Such a pain. Guess it's kind of ironic, though, considering what I do. Wipe up for you. - Here you go. - Thanks. There you go. So, how have you been feeling in general? Okay, I guess. I just want to get it over with. Just about everyone says the same thing at this point. It won't be long now, though. Okay, well, if you don't have any more questions for me, then the doctor will be going over all the results with you at your visit next week. - Okay. - Okay. Can you tell me your name? Can you open your eyes for me? Get breath sounds, too, when you get that done. We got the one I.V. We're gonna get another one... bilateral arm. Got a mid-20-year-old female involved in an assault. Obvious trauma to the head, vaginal bleeding, unresponsive. - Got one 14-gauge I.V. On... - One, two, three. We need to get a second I.V. Let's start some more I.V. fluids and get two units of O-neg blood. We need to call O.B. Stat. Ma'am, I'm Dr. Bales. Can you hear me? Are you having any pain? She's unresponsive. Give me the O.B. B.P. Stat. - Dr. Bales? - Yes. They can't be here for at least 30 minutes. They're in surgery. The baby's heart rate is really low. I need a blood pressure. Blood pressure's 60. We can't wait. We have to get the baby out now. I need a scalpel. Dr. Romero. Dr. Romero, please. Come in. - Esther Woodhouse? - Yes. My name is detective Allen. Do you have a few minutes to talk? Okay. May I? - How are you feeling? - Pretty sore. Not great, I guess. I'm very sorry about your baby. I know this will sound strange, but you are actually quite lucky. And how's that? You lost a lot of blood. Most people don't come back from that. You're right. That is a strange thing to say. Nevertheless, that's what you should be focusing on right now. How much worse things could have been. It'll help with the anger. So... Do you feel up to talk about what happened, what you remember? I... don't really remember much of anything. I left my O.B. Appointment. And I was walking to the bus stop. And then I woke up here. Everything else is just pieces, fragments. I couldn't tell you what was real or not. We recovered your purse at the entrance to the alley where you were found. We'll have you check it just to be sure, but... It looks like all that's missing is - whatever money you would have had. - When can I have it back? Um... soon. It's safe. I know. I just want it back. - I'd just like to have it back. - Okay, um, I'll see what I can do. Is there anyone you can think of, Esther, anyone at all, that may have held a grudge against you? Can I think of anyone who might want to kill my baby? No. What about the father? Sperm bank. Sperm... - Why a sperm bank? - Doesn't matter now. Co-workers, acquaintances? No. Why are you asking me all this? This thing that happened to you, Esther... this type of assault is almost always carried out by someone who knows the victim personally. The time it took to do this, the risk, The emotion involved to follow through with something so... It's just not characteristic of a random mugging. Well, I don't know who would want to do it. What about someone on drugs or... a misogynist... or maybe just some crazy homeless person who lived in that alley? Yeah, yeah. I mean, those... those are all definite possibilities. Looks like you have your next visitor. I'll get out of here, and I'll let you two get acquainted. Just, uh... give some thought to what I said. Call me anytime. My cellphone's on there and everything. - Okay. - I'll be in touch soon. So sorry, again, for your loss. Hi, Miss Woodhouse. I'm Mary Wilkens. I'm one of the social workers here at the hospital. - Hi. - How are you feeling? Going to get that question a lot around here, I guess. Yeah. Well, I'll try and make it quick so we can let the next one come in. - The next one? - The doctors, the nurses, rehab, police, social workers, religious counsel... all day and, I'm afraid, all night, until you leave here. There's gonna be more people come through that door than you know what to do with. You're gonna get sick of the attention. So, who can I call to talk to about helping you transition back into life? Uh, there really isn't anyone. - I'm kind of on my own. - Family, co-workers? I don't have any family. Friends? Who are you close to? My fish. Sweetie, I need names. Give them up. I'm sorry. There really isn't anyone... no one who would care. You're gonna need a support system, people to help you through this. Without it, it's going to be incredibly difficult. Well, the Chaplain's been in and the police and you. I'm talking about long-term support. We're here to help you with the initial phase of recovery. Have you ever had any formal therapy before? No. That lists therapists and counselors as well as several support groups that specialize in victims of violent crimes and women who have lost a child. Thank you. - I'll take a look at it. - I hope you do. Don't fall through the cracks. Too many people do. You have to reach out now. You remember the people who I said who are going to come in to see you and help you? That stops once you leave here. We're here to help and support you, but the second you walk out the front doors of the hospital, we disappear. I go onto to the next person that needs help and then the next. You understand? Okay. Sorry, buddy. One new message. Hey, it's me. Just wondering if you're okay. Okay. I'll just, uh, try you back later when I can. Message deleted. And he just kept laughing and laughing. You know what really gets me, though, is that he thought this was just a-a joke. Thank you for sharing that, Audrey. So, would anyone else like to share before we take a short break? All right then. For those of you who are new to our group, we have pastries and coffee, so please feel free to help yourself. So, let's take about, um, 10 minutes, okay? This your first meeting? - Yeah. - I thought so. I'm Melanie. - Esther. - So nice to meet you. - You kind of had that look on your face. - What look? Oh, like you're not quite sure what to make of this place. Well, I've just never really done anything like this before. I get it. The first time is always strange. - Here you go. - Thank you. Ooh, I love the shirt. - Thanks. It wasn't expensive. - Even better. It looks really good on you. Most of these women... they've been through some really horrific things. Do you think coming here helps? I do. I mean, there is something about hearing other people tell you the terrible things that have happened to them that... kind of makes you feel better about your own problems. It's like you're not alone. Is this how I look? Honest? Yes. Hey, but don't worry. That's why you're here, right? How come you don't? I guess most of my damage is on the inside. We're coming back now, so please feel free to join the group. Great. Thank you. - Ready? - Does everyone have to... talk about what happened to them? Oh, no, no. You don't have to do anything. You can... Just sit. A lot of people just come, and they listen, they don't talk. And then there's others... don't shut up. Come on, you. Come sit with me. My husband and son. What happened to them? They were coming to pick me up from work one night. Drunk driver ran a light. That was it. I'm sorry. They say it gets better... but it doesn't. It never gets easy. And everyone around you... they forget almost immediately. I think that's probably one of the most unbearable parts. They want you to forget, too, but... That's why I go to the groups. You can tell your story for as long as you need to, and no one gets sick of you being in pain and... no one gets tired of caring. I lost my baby. I was walking to the bus stop. And then... You don't need to tell me. It's still too soon. But you know what? For whenever you're ready. Because we all need someone to listen. Can I help you? I just... I didn't know where else to go. Well, I'm sorry, but you can't be back here. Do I have to leave? - What do you mean? - Is there someplace I can just.. sit? Well, no. This is a hospital. You can't just be here. Anywhere? There's a waiting room around the corner. I guess you could sit there. Thank you. Okay, just... you have to find someplace else to go. Hi, you've reached Melanie. Leave me a message. Hi, Melanie. It's Esther... from the other night... the meeting. I was calling to see if you were going today and... wondered if you wanted to get coffee again after. So, anyway, I guess I'll see you there. Okay. Bye. Good afternoon. I just want to begin by thanking each and every one of you for joining us today. My name is Denise Meadows, and I'm the director of the women's healing network. I'm a licensed therapist and a grief counselor... and I've been in this field for over twenty years. And what I can tell you is I understand that it took a lot of courage for you to come here today. But I wanted to let you know we all have something in common. We all have lost someone that is very important to us. Excuse me. Is there something that I can help you with? - Yes. Can I fill out an application? - Sure. Here you are. You want to go ahead and fill that out, bring it back on in? - Can I fill it out here? - If you'd like. - There you go. - Thank you. Peyton? Peyton? Peyton! Oh, my God. Peyton! - Please, help my son. - Is everything okay here? My son... he was just... he was literally standing here with me one se... - He was just right here. - Can you tell me what he looks like? He's... Peyton! Where are you?! He's... Ma'am, can you describe your son to me? - He's blond. He's... he's three. - Okay. Okay. - Oh, my God. I can't believe I lost him. - Blond hair. What was he wearing? He's in a T-shirt. He's in his favorite... he's in his favorite blue T-shirt. - Blue T-shirt, blond hair. - Yeah, blue T-shirt, blond hair. - He's got blue eyes. - Okay. Three years old. He'd never leave. Somebody took him. I bet somebody took him! Okay, I tell you, I'm gonna go look and see in the... Someone took him! I'm gonna check outside! I will look on the internal security cameras, ma'am... - and see if we can find him. - Thank you so much. Peyton! Oh, please, Peyton! One new message. Hi, Esther. This is Melanie. Sorry I'm just getting back to you now. I had some personal things to tend to today, and I just couldn't make the meeting, but... I would love to get together again. I would really hate to wait another week. How is tomorrow afternoon looking for you? There's a great place that really helps keep me centered... give me a call. - Hi. - Hi. - There you go. - Thank you. So, how are things? Okay. Good I hope it's okay that we came here. Sure. Do you come here a lot? I do. My son and I... we used to come here together. I don't know. I suppose it should hurt, but... Somehow, I get a bit of peace. What was his name? Peyton. What happened to the driver... the drunk one? Oh, I don't know. I thought about asking, wanting to know if it was instant for him... or if he suffered. But... Figured I'd rather not know. That way I can tell myself that he suffered. I do feel lucky, though. Oh, some of these other women... what they've been through. The absolute worst are the ones whose kids have been taken... kidnapped. They say the worst thing about losing a child through abduction and not knowing whether they're alive or dead, it's... it's just that... the not knowing. For me... if it was me the... the worst part, the thing that would just... Eat away at me, just sicken me would be the fact that I would hope for my child to be dead. Most parents... they hope for their child to be returned, that everything will be okay. But are they ever really okay? No, they're... broken. I forgot how much I love fucking you. So, who was she? Who? That fucking bitch you were with at the park. It's nobody. Just this woman from my support group. You wouldn't be cheating on me, would you? Of course not. I hope not. Not after what I did for you. God, I missed you. Look, I'm not gonna pretend to understand any of this. I did it because you asked me to. Nobody else would have done it. You know why? Because I'm the only one who really loves you. You know that, right? So, why haven't you been returning my calls? You said we shouldn't talk... - to be safe. - I know. I said you shouldn't call me. How am I supposed to keep you safe if I don't know where you are? - Next time I call, you answer, okay? - Okay. Come here. Mommy knows what she's doing, okay? I'm gonna keep you safe. That's my girl. That's my girl. - Hello? - Hi, Esther. It's Melanie. - Oh, hi. - I hope I'm not calling too late. No, it's fine. Good. I was actually wondering if you're up for a late coffee. Well, I'm not really dressed. Oh, okay. It's kind of last minute anyway. - Um, maybe tomorrow, then? - Do you want to just come over here? Are you sure? I-I wouldn't want to impose. No. I'd love to see you again. Okay, I'll be right over. Um, where do you live? - I think I owe you an apology. - Why? Well, the last time you asked to get together, I just... all I did was talk about myself the whole time, my problems. It's okay. I like listening to you. Well, tonight it's about you, if you're ready to talk. I, um... I was pregnant almost nine months, about two weeks away from my due date. I hadn't had any complications. I'd had a great pregnancy. I loved it. People just treat you differently when they know you're going to have a baby. Usually when I walk down the street... people don't even notice me. It's like I'm not even there. But then suddenly they saw me. Not only that, they wanted to touch me, and they were smiling at me. And it was like just me being there made them happy. Were you excited... about being a mother? I never wanted to be a mother. I don't understand. I think you're the only one who understands. - Esther, what are you doing? - I'm sorry. Why... why would you do that? I'm so sorry. I thought you wanted me to. You thought I wanted you to? I'm not a lesbian. Neither am I. I think I should go. I saw you with your son. At the... You don't know what you're talking about. Do you understand me? Do you?! I'm fine. You need help. You need help, Esther, and it's not coming from me. Don't you ever, ever call me again. Okay, bath time. He's getting ready, and I laid his jammies out on the bed. Babe, could you do it tonight? You kidding me? - Please? - Don't give me that look. I... - Oh, come on. I'm watching this. - I do the bath every night. You're like cool, fun dad. You get to read and play games, - and then I bathe and I... - That's right. I'm cool, fun dad. Cool, fun dad. Cool, fun dad is deep into a game with only 15 minutes left. Please? Peyton? Bath time! Hey, you. Peyton, let's do this! Peyton! No, no, no, no, no! Please! No! Stay with mommy. Come here. Peyton, please, no, no, no. What's wrong?! Ambulance! Call an ambulance! Go! God, please, no! Please, Peyton. Please stay with mommy. Stay with mommy. I'm so sorry. God, please, please. Please don't be scared. What... what are you doing here? - Did you do this? - I did it for you. No. I would never hurt you. I just came to do the things you couldn't do. Don't you see? So we can be together. Melanie. No more lies. We're the same. Hel... Hello? Melanie? - Yes? - Hey. It's Laurie. - Hi, Laurie. - How are you doing, honey? Oh, you know. Getting by. Just kind of hard getting back to things. Oh, honey. We've all been so worried. I've tried to call so many times, and no one has seen you guys. Have... have you been out of the house at all? No. No. Not since... We need to get you out of there. You need to talk to us. I'm calling Megan right now and telling her we're going to lunch today. - No, I-I can't. I just... it's too soon. - Honey, please. - You need to... - I said I can't. Sorry. Bye. She was talking to you. What? When I came back, she was talking to you. Before I shot her right there... she was talking to you. What was she saying? Only that you were next. She's gonna love this. I doubt that. She's fucking dead. Oh, damn. I'm sorry, honey. What happened? Some dickless piece of shit shot her. Holy fuck. That's pretty hardcore. - Is that little girl you've been seeing? - Yeah. And not only that, but they're trying to say that she killed their kid. Shit. Oh, fuck, I remember hearing about this. Didn't it happen right after you went in? It was right before, but I didn't find out until I got out. - How did you hear about it? - Small town. Plus I'm sure you read about it in the paper. What paper? The newspaper? They don't have newspapers in there? I don't know who the fuck reads newspapers. Uh, whoever wants to know what the fuck's going on, I guess. - So? - So... what? So, what the fuck did the newspaper say? Oh, I don't know. What you said. That someone was killed after killing some kid. - Did it say their names? - The parents? Yeah. Hmm, I don't remember. But I'm sure you can look it up online. Pat? What? What are you looking at? A truck. A truck? This truck's just been sitting there. Hasn't moved since... that night. You hungry? I... This fucking truck has been parked out there since that night. - It hasn't moved. - Okay, I see it. Pat. Patrick. You're hurting my arm. Where are you going? I thought I'd go to... to Peyton's school and get his things. Thought maybe we could go together. Your dad called earlier. He... He was wondering when you'd be back in the office. Everyone misses you. That second shot. What? I shouldn't have taken that second shot. I could have tried to stop the bleeding... Told the police she got away. I could have found out who she was. I have all those tools in the basement. I could have figured out why. Then I could have done it the right way. Mr. Verdel? Mrs. Michaels. - Is this a good time? - Of course. Come in. The students are at recess. How are you getting along? One day at a time, I guess. Thank you for coming to the funeral, by the way, and... for your card. I'm sorry I haven't... haven't had a chance to get around to get around to thank-you note yet. No, please, I'm... I'm not expecting anything like that. I'm just sorry more of the other students didn't attend the services. I don't think children need to be at funerals. It's not really the place for them. I'm sorry. I just, um... I don't really know... What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to just get his things or... Yes, I-I have everything together. I didn't mean for you to have to come here. Would have dropped it off when you were ready. Guess I didn't know when that was gonna be, you know? Turned out it was today. It's mostly art projects, crafts, paintings, some supplies, things like that. Ms. Michaels? Ms. Michaels. I'm sorry, but the students will be back in just a minute. Of course. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Verdel, for all your help. Hi, Laurie. Um, little bit better today. Thank you. I was actually wondering if that offer for lunch was still on the table. I just could really get out of the house today. Oh, I don't care. Anywhere's great. Sure, um, that sounds wonderful. Thank you so much for doing this. No, I'll just... I'll talk to you when I see you. Okay. Bye. Can I help you, dear? Yeah, I want to talk to the guy who wrote this. Uh-huh. And what is this regarding? This. I see. Unfortunately, I'm not able to allow direct access to the reporters. I can give you a phone number to the news desk or an e-mail address. Why? Why can't I just talk to him? - As I just explained... - Is he back there right now? That is beside the point. Ma'am, you are not allowed back there. I'm calling security. Raymond Sheeley? Which one of you is Raymond Sheeley? - Can I help you? - Are you Raymond Sheeley? - No, but... - Well, then get the fuck out of my way. Are you Raymond Sheeley? Did you write this? - Yeah. - What were their names? - Who? - The people that shot her. - I can't tell you that. - Don't fuck with me, Raymond. - What were their fucking names?! - I don't know! They... They didn't want them disclosed! - It's time to go, miss. - Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me! Get me those names, Raymond! I said get your hands off me! Come back again, we'll call the police. Patrick? One new message. Message one. Hello. This message is for Melanie Michaels. I'm calling from the channel 8 news desk. We received your message and are very sorry to hear about the loss of your son. Unfortunately, it turns out we ran a segment on this incident... Message deleted. No new messages. You are home. Where else would I be? Pat, you don't look so good. How should the father with a dead son look? Babe, you can't think like that. Or maybe you should. And what's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Why don't you come upstairs with me? I got something to show you. Come on. He's all around us. We're gonna be okay. Babe. I know. I know. I know. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. We could always have another one. - Morning, dad. - Morning. It's good to have you back. How you doing? I don't know how to answer that question anymore. Okay. You know I'm right next door if you need to talk or... just want to get out of here early. All right. Thanks, dad. It's good to see you, son. - Detective Oler. - Detective Oler, hi. - Uh, this is Patrick Michaels. - Yes? You're investigating the death of my son, Peyton. Yes, I remember, Mr. Michaels. How can I help you? Well, I found something that I felt I should tell you about. Okay. There's a truck that's been parked on our street ever since that day. - It hasn't moved. - Uh-huh. Well, I went into the truck, and I found a vehicle registration card for Anika... What do you mean, went inside of it? I went inside the truck. Mr. Michaels, did you break into this vehicle? N... no. It was unlocked. I just opened the door. It does not matter if it was unlocked. Did you take anything from the vehicle? Vehicle? Well, like I was just saying, I found this vehicle registration card. Mr. Michaels, you really must leave this to us. I understand that you're upset. Now, I suggest you return whatever items you took from the vehicle immediately. I will have someone check it out today, and we'll be sure to notify you if anything develops. - Mr. Michaels? - Fine. Fuck! Peyton? Peyton, mommy can't see you. Peyton? Excuse me. You dropped your hat. Here you go. That's mine over there. I think we've seen you here a few times before. Which one's yours? - Hello? - Hey, Laurie, I-it's me. Hey. How are you? Um... I'm okay. I was actually wondering if maybe we could get together and do lunch again today. Oh, honey, I'm sorry, I can't today. Are you sure? I-I just... I could really use someone to talk to today. No, I just can't. - Okay. No, no, I get it. - Have you tried to call Megan? Yeah, you know what? I don't even... I don't even have her number. Do you think you could give it to me? - Sure. - Okay, just hold on one sec, okay? Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. Okay, it's 969-1134. - You there? - No, no, I'm here. Okay. Well, talk to you soon, honey. Okay. Thanks. I'm gonna step out for a minute, son. Mel, it's Marshall. I have Patrick here. We're at the hospital, the E.R. He hurt himself, but he's okay, physically, I guess. Look, they're concerned about him here, and so am I, how he's handling Peyton. They're sending us to some kind of support group for this sort of thing. Look, I have to get back to the office, but I really think you should be there. He needs you right now. The group is in an hour. It's at some church loca... Come on. Esther, come on. Thank God. Patrick? Would you like to introduce yourself? No, I was told that I didn't have to talk. That's true. You don't have to. I'm... hi. I'm Patrick Michaels. Would you mind standing up for us, Patrick? My name is Patrick Michaels. Uh, I'm here because my son Peyton was murdered, and I can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about his little body laying there... And h... how he's never gonna smile at me again, and I can't stop thinking about the woman that did it and... All the things that I want to do to her, all the ways that I want to hurt her. Okay. Let's try redirecting this anger. What do you miss most about Peyton? I miss not feeling guilty about being a bad father. Um, I... You know, I used to feel like.. uh, working and making money, uh, providing a home and food for my family was enough, you know, was the role that, uh, I played. And now all... I can think about is just the things that we didn't do together, time that I didn't spend with him, things we'll never get to do together, and all the times that I said, "not now"... To this little boy that just wanted to play with his dad... How I was too... busy or too tired. Uh, I miss... taking my entire life for granted. - Mr. Michaels. - Yes? - Hi. I'm Elliot. - Patrick. Sorry. I-I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted to say that I really appreciated what you had to say back there, your honesty. - Thank you. - Sure. I've been coming to these for some time now. You don't see it that often. I'm sure your wife's happy that you're coming now, too. You know, I lost my little girl about four years ago... What do you mean, "coming now, too"? Well, it's just that I've seen her at several of... Melanie, right? Yes. Melanie's been here? Well, sure. I'd say off and on for about a year now. But our son only died a month ago. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I must have made a mista... It's just... I-I remembered the name Peyton and that he'd been kidnapped, and I thought she said her husband's name was Patrick. Our son wasn't kidnapped. He... He was murdered in our house. Again, I'm sorry. I must be wrong. - It's nice to have met you. - Hold on. - I really should get going. - Wait. - Who are you? - Anika Baron? It's "ah-ni-kah." Who are you? I'm Detective Oler with the Richmond police department. May I come in? No. Let's just do it here. Would you like to put some clothes on? No, not really. Why? You don't like this? Did you recently report a vehicle missing? Yeah, my truck, like a month ago. - A 2005 Chevy, red? - Yeah. And you reported it before you went to county for four weeks on an assault and battery charge? Well, I thought the fucking bitch had taken it. Guess I was wrong. Right. So, what? You actually found it? We found it abandoned in the Reeveston area. Reeveston? - Yeah. - So, can I go get it? Actually, no. It's being taken down to the impound lot this afternoon for processing and further investigation. Further investigation for what? You fucking found it. That's why I came here to talk to you. Your vehicle is being entered as potential evidence in a homicide. There was a break-in in that area, and a child was murdered. I don't know anything about that. I didn't say you did, but you will need to come down for a formal statement about the vehicle, - make sure nothing's Missing. - When do I get my truck back? Once we've established there's no connection. In the meantime, if you think of anybody who might have taken the vehicle, give me a call. Fine. Thank you for your time. And we'll be in touch about that statement. Last night, a home invasion in Richmond came to a tragic end with the death of a young boy. The father shot and killed the intruder before she had a chance to flee the scene. With more on this terrible tragedy, we go to Tom Warren. Thanks, Larry. Details are still uncertain at this time as to exactly what happened in this home. We do know the forensics team is alre... We tried to speak with the mother of the deceased, but she's understandably distraught, and she's unable to comment. Where have you been? Thinking. Okay. A-about what? Trying to make sense out of a lot of things that don't make sense. I don't know what you're talking about. What have you been telling people about Peyton? I... What have you been saying about my son? I don't... I don't know what you mean. I... nothing... Patrick. Oh, my God. It's time for you to stop lying to me, okay? It's time for you to stop lying! I'm not. Look... I don't know what you think you know, but... How do they know about you, then?! How do they know about him?! Who? Who? How does who know what? Patrick, please, come on. Who the fuck was she? Who was she?! I don't know, okay? Is that what you want me to say? I don't know! I wish I knew, but I... Please, babe, just put that down. I'm sorry, Mel. I can't do this anymore. Look at me, okay? Just look at me. Put that down. We just... we need to talk. - It's just us, okay? - It's too late for talking. I can't even stand to be around you. I need to leave. What are you saying? I just need to go. - So, he tell you where to find it? - Kind of. - Did you get what I asked? - Hmm. - I don't even want to know. - Good. - Reeveston. - Okay. There. - You're gonna just take it? - That's what's gonna happen. All right. I'll see you later, then. Thanks, bitch. This must be the right house. Just... just relax. Just relax. We're... we're just getting... we're just getting to know each other. - What do you want? - No, no, no, no. We're not gonna play that game, you know, 'cause you know exactly why I'm here. You fucked my girl, and your dickless piece of shit husband shot her. So, you don't get to ask any questions. You don't get to tell me any stories. But since it looks like we've got a little bit of time... I'd like to get some answers. Number one... how the fuck do you know me? I don't know you. I don't know... I'm... I'm sorry. Uh, continue. - I saw you at Esther's house. - Hmm. Okay. So, does your husband know that you've gone dyke? What? No. I'm not. What are you tal... Stop hitting me, please! I didn't even do anything with her! Okay. I believe you. It's too bad. She was good. She was crazy. That's what made her a great fuck. Oh, don't worry. That... that's not for you. That's for your husband. You see, it's like so few men... get the chance to know what it's really like to get fucked. So... Since he doesn't have that much time left, I figured I'd show him. And... and you can watch. You're sick. Yeah. And you haven't even heard what I've got planned for you yet, princess. You do know she killed my child. And whose fault is that? So, where is he? I don't have all day. I don't know. He left. He's probably never coming back. I'll take my chances. - Is the kitchen that way? - What? - Where's your toilet? - What? Your head. Down the hall. What's that? - What? - That sound. Like water running. I don't know. I don't hear anything. That's a fucking shower. Is that a fucking shower? Is he upstairs? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even hear anything. Wow. You are a sneaky, little bitch. He's fucking upstairs taking a shower. Unbelievable. Oh, fuck me. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck you! You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch! Oh, shut up already, please. Although, you know, I should be thanking you. You've made this a much better story. Oh, my God. You are fucked up. No wonder Esther fucking liked you. Our next story is that of every mother's worst nightmare. Two years ago, an unknown intruder broke into the home of Melanie Michaels. Her son was tragically murdered by the intruder, who was then shot and killed by her husband when trying to escape. One month later, the vengeful lover of the intruder returned, Taking the life of her husband. Melanie was then forced out of self-defense to kill the second assailant. I had the opportunity to sit down with Mrs. Michaels and talk about her story. - Melanie, thank you for being with us. - Thank you so much for having me. I am so sorry for your terrible loss. This is truly every mother's worst nightmare. How are you handling everything? Well, I don't think there's ever really a way to handle it. It's just taking it one day at a time. But there isn't a moment that goes by that... that I don't think about my boys. Excuse me. I'm sure. But what you're not doing and what you're being commended for is not allowing yourself to become a victim. And, in fact, you've written a book in order to turn your experience... - into education for other parents. - Yes, I have. It's called "our children, our responsibility," and it details your story, as well as, in retrospect, what you could have possibly done to prevent this tragedy. Exactly. I feel that there's a lot of parents out there... that take their child's safety, as well as their own, for granted. And if I could just prevent what happened to us... from happening to someone else, then I feel that Peyton and Patrick's deaths, they will not have been in vain. Right. Well, it takes a very brave parent to admit they made mistakes, - especially so publicly. - Thank you. I also understand that a few television networks are interested... in turning your story into a movie? Yes, there's some talks and some offers, but nothing's set in stone yet. Well, I wish you the best of luck with that and your book. I know the more people that hear your message and your story... - the better off we'll all be. - Thank you. That means a lot. And finally, I understand you have another big announcement. I do. I recently got remarried, and... well, we found out this morning that... I'm pregnant. Who the fuck are you talking to? Everyone.
