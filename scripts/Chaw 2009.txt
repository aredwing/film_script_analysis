Did you call headquarters? Come on! It's just a corpse! Why do they always send wimps like him to our station? Officer PARK! Sir! You can just walk out. What kind of bastard digs up a grave and takes the corpse! Put anything expensive inside the coffin? Just a 14k gold ring. - What the hell. - Damn it! We just buried him two days ago... Did he have any enemies? No. What's this? Your father must've loved caps to put this in his coffin. Major League Basketball, sir. - Evidence 1. - Yes, sir. Any news from headquarters? They're busy. A detective won't come till tonight. Guess a lost body at a gravesite isn't a priority. Disrespecting our village station! Let's go take your statement. - If you false testify... - I know. - You'll be arrested. - Let's go! Where are you from? - Can't speak Korean? - No Korean. Give me, give me. Drive, drive license license! Damn it. - Hey! Let go! - Get in, now! Let go! Get lost! You're drunk, aren't you? Your license, please. Good work, Officer. I'm Prosecutor JANG at Seoul District. Ah... your license, please. I am little busy now. I'll be in touch. You fool! You glaring at me! Got your license, Min? Driving without a license! Hey! Over here! Let go! Drunk driving's real bad, huh? Yes. Let's go, sir. I didn't do anything wrong! You little bastard! What? You little punk! How dare you glare at me! You son of a bitch! You bastard! Let go! Hey asshole! Stop right there! Come back here! - Hello. - Hi. Had another scuffle? Come here and have some instant noodles. Scratching lottery tickets again? No, I switched to game, now. What did the Captain say? He looked pretty mad. Someone called in saying I'm giving out too many tickets. But it's okay for a cop to be slapped? I could get fired. That's crazy. It's your last week in Seoul. Go easy. What do you mean? What? Didn't the Captain tell you? Tell me what? That you've been posted to a village station? You wrote down 'anywhere' as your second choice. That was a joke. Cheers! Perfect! City folks will pay 3 times more if you tell 'em it's organic food. Well being's the way! The town folks make money selling their goods at high prices. But what about me? Go on. Put it in. Wow, that looks fresh! That's hot! Libido! Libido my ass! I'll get fried eating this again. Damn fresh! You have the weekend farming project. I'll give you 10,000 ft 2 of the orchard for all your hard work. - You sure this increases libido? - Of course! Why do I feel like you're playing with me. Think we can make money? City folks have money to spare! We can lot-out the land and get rent. A hot-spring, a golf course, and now weekend farming lots. Other town folks are rioting that we're getting special favors. Let's go to the town for another round of drinks. Damn Hot! Sam-mae-ri the Crimeless Village Hey, Chief! Drank a few bottles, did ya? Capt. YOO! Wanna go into town for a drink? I'm still on patrol. This is a crimeless village. Let's go some place nice. Really? I heard about the case up in the mountains today. - A case? - It's nothing. Some fool dug up an old man's corpse and ran! Dang! I'm investigating it thoroughly. No worries. The town's economy is just picking up. Bad rumors, and city folks won't come. Handle it quietly. Since you're busy on the case, we'll have drinks next time. Let's go. Man, he's always challenging my authority. Over here! Another dish of pork head meat, please. All packed up? - Yes, but... - What? Think about it. Moving to the countryside with a pregnant wife and sick mother. Damn. Drink up. When you're young... it's good experience to work in a place like that. Watch tractors and go fishing. It's way better than the rotten life here in Seoul. I'm jealous, pal. Damn. What's wrong? Thought I broke my tooth. What is it? Hey, it's a pig tooth! Looks like you're in for a lucky streak. Grandpa! Grandpa! Granddaughter What was that? - Is she dead? - Not yet. What do we do? Let's take her to the hospital. Hey, wait! She's a goner anyways. Then what? I was driving drunk without a license. So we just leave her here? The passenger also gets charged in a drunk driving accident, too. You know? Sorry, mister. Hold still, mom! I have to go home. - Let go! - It's mine! I'm sorry. Mom! Let go! Don't forget to flush. Turn back, Mister. Turn back! Now! Go back! For God's sake! What are you doing? Sam-mae-ri 11km Hey, Soo-ryun! Jane Goodall What? Soo-ryun! What! Found something? Come here! There... It's just a magazine. Hey, kid. What's your name? Duk-goo. What are you drawing? - It's a letter. - A letter? Mackerels, mountains, pigs... And that looks like a witch. What are you doing, Duk-goo, dear? Nothing. Are you writing a letter to aliens again, dear? No. Mommy told you not to leave the baby and go out. I'm sorry, ma'am. I told you to call me mommy! Mommy! Say it! Mommy... That's right... mommy. I'll get you, boy! You're so dead! Guys are all the same! Never listen! Don't mind them. It's a strange family. He lived with his granny the shaman up in the mountains. But after she died, that crazy woman tarted to taking care of him. - She thinks she's his mom. - Really. But she's beating him so hard. It's less than usual. So, are you the new cop? Yes. I'm the Chief of Sam-mae-ri village. Hello, sir. I'm KIM Kang-soo. I'm PARK Man-bok. Your wife's a real beauty. That's my mom. Really? Hope you enjoy living here. Thank you. Where's the police captain's house? Capt. YOO? They're all at the ranch on a case. A case? You were there to research on wild animals? Our thesis is on the modification of wild boars to environmental changes. When did you find the body? Around 10 am. You were drunk last night and don't remember anything. I completely blacked out. Know what happens if you false testify? No, what? You get arrested. I see... - Find anything? - Yes, sir! Dang! That's it? The remains are all over the place. We'll have to collect 'em at daybreak. Never seen a body cut up so badly in my 10 years as detective. You go back to the grave, tomorrow. Yes, sir. Captain! Can you collect the remains in the morning? Who? Me? - Officer PARK! - Yes? Hear that? Get the rest, tomorrow. Shouldn't you be more cooperative? You're famous at headquarters. For what? Do it yourself, Capt. - Yes, sir. - Hi, Capt. YOO! Hi, Chief. What's going on? A murder case, at last, in our village. Dang! Chopped up? Folks from Seoul are coming this weekend. - Who's this? - Oh him. He's Officer KIM transferred here from Seoul. Allegiance! Officer KiM Kang-soo will... No need. But sir... Collect the body parts with Officer PARK at daybreak. Yes, sir. Thought you'd be watching tractors and just fishing around here, huh? Sir? I'm right, aren't I? As you can see, this ain't an easy village. - Officer PARK? Let's go! - Yes, sir. Damn manure! Morning! Good day. I'm sorry I can't stomach these things. No problem. Can you wash our boots later? Sure. Shit. That stinks. Oh, shit. Finished with the report? I'm on it now, sir. What's taking you so long! You writing a thesis! - Allegiance! - Finished collecting the remains? Yes, sir. I turned it over for an autopsy. We cleaned it up good at daybreak. Since the victim hasn't been identified... get a list of reported missing people until forensics calls. Yes, sir. Who's coming with me to the autopsy? I'll go. You didn't go to the scene, did you? Yes, I did. At what time? When did you get up? He didn't go. I knew it. Mr. CHUN! Is it your firearms examination day? No. I heard the body they found was a woman. Can I see who it is? Why? My granddaughter didn't come home! Really? We were just about to go. Go with them, sir. Let's go. - Bye, then. - go. Detective SHIN. Is this a murder case? Yes. That's from the dug up gravesite. This wasn't done by knives or saws. The wounds are sharp, but really rough. Then? Something sharp like this... ripped 'em into shreds. Hey, there's two of 'em? Two? This finger's the old man's. But this head piece is around 40. And it's less decayed. They died at different times. It's not human. An animal did this. Only a mountain animal can leave wounds like this. What mountain animal? I can't say for sure. But it's definitely an animal. A really... big one. We'll take good care of your produce Like it is our very own. We'll protect your health with organic produce. And we'll make more profit with direct selling. It's a win-win deal for everyone. Here, here! Thank you. You're saying we should close down the weekend farming cuz of the murder? It could be dangerous. We don't know anything yet. Are you crazy? It's harvest season! We can't close off the mountains, now! It'll just be for a few days till we solve this case. That'll ruin a year's worth of farming! If it's dangerous, can't the police stand guard? Stand guard? Fine, then. And keep this a secret to the rest of the village. If word gets out, the city folks will all run away! Understood? Get to work, then. - Goodnight, sir. - Bye. Damn bastard keeps challenging my authority. - Officer KiM. - Yes? Stand guard at weekend farming tomorrow with PARK and the others. Yes, sir. But, tomorrow's my day off. - Officer KWON? - Yes, sir! Get me a club from the back. - No! Wait! - Yes, sir! What did you just say? But sir! How dare you! - Sir! - Get the club! Relax, sir. Let me go! I'll get you! - Calm down, sir! - Sir! You call yourself a cop! - Detective SHIN? - Yes? You think it's an animal like Mr. CHUN says? Doesn't seem like he's joking. It can't be. A man-eating animal these days? You never know. It's a crazy world out there. You have to take a piss? - By the way... - Then me, too. You sure it's okay to stay with you? Of course. Just me and my wife anyway. Thought you'd read and go fishing here in the countryside? Give speeding tickets to tractors, huh? Enough with the tractors! It's not like that. Hello... What the hell? Just keep walking. Hurry! Wait for me. Know her? I'll tell you later. - Why's she following us? - She lives next door. - Sorry, It's not much. - It's good. Thank you. Is it really good? - Mother! - You bitch! You stole my food, didn't you! - Mom. - You bitch! - You ate my food! - Mom! She's pregnant! Stop it! Stop it! She's your mother! You're embarrassing me, Mom! Can't you ever do what you really want? Shut up! You always do what other people tell you! I heard you wrote 'anywhere' on your application! Damn it! Where ya goin' mister? Give me my food! Enjoy your meal. You like eating all that by yourself? How many bowls did you eat! Mother, please! I didn't ask for a shoe! City folks go crazy when they hear it's organic. - It's good. - I'm serious. What's this? Jackpot! Never seen anything like this. Pick the fresh ones, folks. Anything happen? No, sir. Did you find any clues? Nope. I have no idea. Of course, you don't. You're from Seoul. How was the job in Seoul? A total living hell. Right. It's no place to live. The people are rude. I grew up in Daejeon, the educational city. That's a good sized city. By the way, I heard you were born in '78. I was born in '77. So? Perhaps we could drop formalities when it's just us? And I am a 2 year senior in working here. Sounds interesting. - Hey. - Yeah? Wanna die? Drop the lips! - Jae-eun! No! - What's that? - Mommy! - Oh no! - Somebody help! - What's wrong? She got bitten by something. Are you okay, dear? Hold still. It's okay. It's okay. It'll be okay. It's kind of a venomous snake. Go to the hospital quickly. - A viper? - What's going on? Take her to the hospital now! - I have a bad back! - Just do it! - Here. - She'll be fine! Send everyone back, Chief! It's not poisonous. - It's just a field snake. - It's venomous! - Don't flip over a snake. - Damn! Look, a police car. I hope nothing's wrong. Me, too. Let's go. It's getting late. Just a few more, hon. Why? So you can give it to her? Stop it. It's not true. How can you smile! Come on. You know I love you. - Go get Seo-hyun! - Okay. Seo-hyun! Come to papa my little princess. What's that? Not again! What's wrong? There! My husband! We need your cooperation. Please keep out, folks. Danger Keep Out Just go back, lock up your homes, and don't worry folks. If you keep us from our fields, what about all our crops! Give us a couple of days and we'll wrap this up. If we don't harvest now, our beans and corn will all go to waste! Right? It's me... It's all my fault. My only granddaughter... What is this mountain animal you're talking about? - A wild boar. - A boar? Boars don't eat humans. The mountains got destroyed by golf courses and weekend farming. And poachers killed off all the animals! So the hungry beasts eventually dug up graves. They developed a taste for human organs. If that's true, this could get ugly. Mr. GWAK's hired hunters are coming tomorrow. Just going to sit and watch, sir? My hunch was right. No way. You saw it, didn't you! Yeah, but... I know it'll show this time. Let's go back up, just once! Please? Soo-ryun, please. We'll publish it and make assistant proffs. Gotta stop wiping after proffs. How'll you ever get married? Soo-ryun, please! Just this once. We can get it this time! You're coming, right? Here. Okay. We'll find it for sure! Stupid! What's this! Excuse me. Can you quiet down a bit, please? - Sorry. - Don't mind them. Honestly, you're really noisy. Sorry, we'll be quiet. - See? Let's just drink. - Okay. Hold on. Stupid son of a bitch! You bitch! - Let go! - Are you okay? Not you again! Let go! Can't you drink quietly! Stop it! On a weekend farming area in Sam-mae-ri... a terrible incident of a wild boar attacking a man took place. As wild boar attacks are on the rise throughout the country... a full-scale hunt for the animals have been enforced. Hey, hunter BAEK! Long time no see, Mr. GWAK. Too busy making money to go deer hunting these days? Thank you for coming out here. Who are they? I especially invited them. Expert bear hunters from Finland. I met them when I was training there. They're really fierce. Finland? Hello! I'm the Chief of Sam-mae-ri village. Nokia! Nokia! Xylitol! Xylitol! The gum? Hyva! Hyva! Stop! Stop! He doesn't chew gum. It'll be over soon, so get the barbecue ready. Mickey! Mighty! No. Way over 300kg. Think it'll show up, today? We set up bait all around. It'll come. Trust me. It's here! It's here! Go look! Hurry! - You go. - Hurry! Hurry! Be careful! No! Allow me to present the killer boar we captured! One, two, three! Incredible, isn't it? The one who captured this beast, the best hunter in the country... Mr. BAEK Man-bae! Give him a big hand, folks! He received training all the way in Finland... Excuse me. You were on the TV documentary called 'The Hunter', right? Yes... Autograph, please. Sign right here, please. Sir! It's been a long time. BAEK Man-bae... I heard you were running a shop somewhere, south. You were in this neck of the woods? It's just a small store. A legendary hunter like you wasting away in a place like this... Want me to get you a job in the Hunting Society? No need. Stubborn as always. - Is that the one? - No. They caught it by the crime scene. Look at its teeth! The real killer is still in the mountain. Quiet down. The reporters will hear. The situation is over. If it happens again, will you take responsibility? Stop the nonsense. It already went out on the news. It's over. - Good work. - Bye. What if it's not! Everyone says that's the one! Even if it's not, are you going to be responsible for the town's loses? What are you doing! I lost my only family. My dear granddaughter! A person's life is worth more than potatoes! Fine! Let me go! Open the mountains back up to the public, today! Heard that Capt. YOO? Sir? Let's cut up its stomach, first. It takes 3 days to digest anything. It's okay. It'll move if you hit the wrong nerve. I haven't done this in 10 years... Even had coffee and dessert. Swallowed it whole. It's the magazine left where your granddaughter was found. They shared their prey. What? The male brought it over and shared it. So the killer beast is this boar's husband? Damn happy couple, huh? It'll come back into the village. Lock up all the warehouses. The hottest new underground band... Mr. GWAK brought to celebrate catching the killer boar! Presenting, Love Space! # You're a city bum! # I'm a gangsta! # I'm a gangsta to the ladies! # Give you my heart! # Know who I am? Hey, Man-bae? Why the long face? Didn't get enough pay? Money's not everything, pal. Just something on my mind. You're hiding something, aren't you? You fool! You'll get punished for doing bad! Quiet! Okay, okay. So mean... The real killer is still in the mountains. We gotta get to it before the hunters! There is no such beast! Come to your senses! Give it up. Give up? Now? We spent 3 years on this project! Tips on how to survive from a boar by the Wildlife Commission. First, don't scream or move. Ifyou do, the boar will likely attack. Don't show your back, but stare at its eyes. Don't show signs of fear. If you have an umbrella, open it and hide behind it... it will mistake it for a rock and pass by. Boars have very bad eyesight... Do boars really confuse an umbrella for a rock? Who takes an umbrella up the mountain? That's nonsense. Can a boar really attack civilian homes? It's possible. - It must be starving, now. - Then we're in trouble. Headquarters thinks the case is closed. Did you contact them again? They said to stop the nonsense and told me to come back. But two people are dead! There's nothing we can do. It's not a murder case. Of course it is! It's closer to a natural hazard or calamity. Are you really going up to there, sir? # No matter what! # Call me when you need me. # I'll run to you day or night. # If anyone else calls me over, I'll think about it long. # But if you call me, I'll run to you no matter what! # Cuz I love you no matter what! # My love for you is A++! # Over the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans! # If you call me, I'll run to you no matter what! # Cuz I love you no matter what! Move! What the hell is going on! Block the gate! Let me in! It's an order! Let me in, please! I am sorry for everything. Move! Out of the way! Please don't shoot! Move! Officer PARK! Officer KWON! Give me the rope! Help me! Crimeless Village Mother! I pledge! To be loyal and true to the country and the people... to serve and protect the community and withhold order. What's up Officer PARK? The killer boar is attacking town hall right now. My mom's there! No need for you to come. I'm protecting Sam-mae-ri. What is it? The boar attacked town hall. Call for back-up! Okay. - Man-bae already knew. - About what? Mi-young! Are you okay? - Are you hurt? - No. - How's the baby? - It's fine. - How's mom? - She's Okay. Have mercy on us, God. Heal the wounded, O Lord... - What happened? - I'm not sure, sir. - Are you okay? - I'll live. It's a different boar, right? Officer PARK, that bastard. Where is he? There... Are you okay? Ah, yes. - Chief? - Yes? - Have you seen Mr. GWAK? - He went to give a tithe. - At the church? - Yes. - Did you see the boar? - Yes. How many? The one was here then another came and... - Two boars? - No, one! One boar... Why's it so heavy? Have you seen my pack of smokes? Hey! Open up! Open up, now! What are you doing in there! The boar... It's all over! Come out! Can't I talk from in here? Come out and talk about it. It must've been scary for you, too. Come on out. I got in here to fight off the boar... So you fought off the boar all by yourself? In here? - Yes. - Any casualties? It just grabbed the barbecued boar and ran out. Stupid bastard doesn't even know it's the same species. You think this Is funny? - No, sir. - Take Capt. YOO to the hospital! - Sun-bae! - My back! Sun-bae! Be careful! Don't worry about me! I'll see to you getting married. Will he be okay? Are you out of your mind! You knew, didn't you! You knew he'd smell the female boar and come! I never trembled before a prey in all my 20 years of hunting. You could've gotten the whole village killed! It's you who taught me to use all I can to hunt down the prey. I never taught you to do such despicable things! Don't remember? When I got bit by a snake and was dying? You said you'd find some herbs and left me there! You left me for bait. You're the one who betrayed and left me! People are like that. Eat and get eaten. Betrayed... Eat and get eaten. You will get eaten first. Mark my words! You'll pay! Man-bae! Why the long face? Don't be sad. We'll meet again, soon. Are you going up the mountain, too? With Capt. YOO in the hospital who else will protect the village? That's a relief. Don't let mom go out, and lock the doors tight. Okay. I'll be home early. You watch your mom for me, big boy. - Daddy will be back. - What about me? Pucker up, then. Can I come, too? We're busy here, Miss. Please? I have to catch the boar on film! Let her come. What if something happens up there? Go back, Miss. - Get out. - I have to go! I have to film it! Please take me? - Lady! - Wait! - Just go. - I have to film the boar! Stop making it difficult! Go! Stubborn girl. Probably has her reasons. There's an old man's cabin half way up the mountain. We'll set up camp there and search around. The bait for the traps alone will be so heavy. I shot it with three slug bullets, but it didn't do a thing. Its skin is rough and strong. Normal bullets won't work. What's this? My father used that to catch bears. A Mosin-Nagant. Made in Russia. No, it's Finland. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! - What Is it? - Mother disappeared. What? Did you look around? I Did, But she's not here. I told you to watch her! What were you doing! I fell asleep. Man! Stay home! I'll be right there! Mom! Mom! Have you seen my mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! What's the matter? - My mom disappeared. - What? The kid next door said she went up the mountain. Are you coming from there? I went up the mountain behind the village, but she's not there. - Take me with you. - Let's go, then. Wait! I'm going, too! You again? Why do you keep trying to come along? Please take me with you. It's dangerous. Stay here. I'll call you when we catch it. I can cook and entertain. Please take me with you? How will you entertain us? Take her. The more the merrier. Thank you, sir! During the Japanese War... The Japanese army began breeding pigs with foreign pigs and boars... to fund the war, but failed. They released the new boars in the mountains. The hills were filled with them. The test-boars were violent and ate everything in sight. Some got as big as 480kg. If charging at full speed, it can break through 10cm thick iron. No tiger or anything can stand against it. Where are you going, son? - Ma'am... - Come here. So you took the food all this time, huh? I told you not to feed the boar, it's dangerous! I'm sorry, ma'am. I told you to call me mommy! Mommy... That's right! Mommy! Ma'am... Hi, there! It's been a long time. Remember me? I'm hunter CHUN's eldest son, ll-man. Call me. What did she say? Still missing. Think positive. We set up a lot of traps, let's just wait. Yeah, stay positive. Why are you so bent on catching that boar? Do you know Jane Goodall? Vidal Sasoon? No, she's a famous zoologist who studied chimpanzees in Africa. I wanted to roam the world researching just like her. What's this? The boar's hair and dung. It's over 10 cm. - The dung? - No, the piece of hair. That means it's a lot bigger than the one we caught. Dung? Gross. - It's not just a boar. - Cut! Show a little more emotion. This time look more surprised. Okay. More emotions, please! Action! - Look at this! - What Is it? - The boar's hair and dung! - Incredible! It's over 10cm! - The dung? - The piece of hair! Oh, no! That means it's way bigger than the other one! - Practically an elephant! - A beast! It's not just a boar... - Oh my god! - Incredible! We're being punished. Long ago, slash-and-burn farmers came up here to make fields. They made a big fire here. The animals got burned and killed and a great boar came and attacked. They eventually all left and hunters came looking for the boar. I followed my father and came here, then. Did you catch the boar, then? - My father did. - How? He set up a huge drop trap at the village entrance. Countless hunters died and got injured back then. KiM from Bul-kyo became a cripple. Mama! Mama! BONG from Shin-eui-ju got his head cut off. And your father lost an eye. Then people stopped coming, so the mountain stayed the same. There should be an old drop trap somewhere along the river. What's a drop trap, sir? They used it in the past to catch tigers. Tie and stand up some logs, and put bait under it. When the tiger goes in for the bait... The heavy stones would drop and crumble. What is this, the Stone Age? Drop trap, my ass. Ever heard of the Baek-baek Cult? Baek-baek Cult? It was a cult during the time of Japanese rule. The leader of the cult killed 2000 of his followers. He ran from the cops and eventually committed suicide here. Then what? When the cops found his body... only his head remained! His body had been eaten up. Is there such a thing as a man-eating boar? 'Horochoros Minor Chageni' Breeding with a foreign species can cause a mutation in the DNA. It's rare, but a man-eating species can be born. Maybe that boar's a mutated species. An unidentified mutant yet in the academic world. That's it. It's still just a boar. - It cut through this wire? - Just took the bait. It's on to us. Wait! Mom! - Can we eat bats? - Of course. There. Really fresh and plump. They're hard to come by. They're really good for you. They're lizard larvae. Great stuff. Eat up and let's get going. I'll take Mom back down. Be careful out there folks. You wanna be the boar's next meal? We set up traps all around. You don't know the way. You're going to chicken out, now? No. But what about my mom? She can stay here till you come back. It's safe here. That's a great idea. Thank you! Let's get going then. Did the beast sleep here? No, it looks like an elk's been here. Hold on. It's a fresh print. How long's it been? Within half a day. It must be nearby. Let's go. Hey! Get me down! You getting caught in a trap? Get me down, now! Hurry up! - Mr. CHUN? - Ow my head. - Damn poachers. - Are you okay? This is the drop trap. It's huge! Big enough to catch an elephant! It's in good shape! Just needs a little work. What's this? A sensor connected to a GPS. I just add some dynamite, then it becomes a Claymore. Looks like something out of a movie. We can't catch it in that primitive way! Wait and see. I'll kill it myself. It reeks! It's only been a few hours. Sir! It's a set print. Its dwelling place must be within 100m. What's a set print? Boars tiptoe their way in to sleep and not leave trails behind. I had no idea there was a cave here. You think it's in there? The cave is deeper than I thought. If you wanna catch it, you gotta go to it. - Baby pigs! - Quiet! This isn't a picnic. It went out for food. Let's set up traps outside the cave. They're kinda cute. Move! You're killing them? - Why? Wanna raise a beast? - But still! Let's take one of 'em. For What? We'll need it. Must you do this? We gotta kill them off good. Still... poor baby pigs. Let's go! What if it comes back! This way! Hurry! Are you okay? I can't feel my butt! - It can't come in here. - Think again! Let's wait for it around here. Since we killed all the baby pigs, it'll come looking for us. If it doesn't show, should we go back to the cave? It probably dug out a new cave. It will definitely come back. The wound's bad. If we don't sterilize it, he'll have to cut it off. Put this in his mouth. What are you doing? - Say, 'Ah'! - What are you doing! Hold him! What are you doing! It's gonna sting! Shit! Crazy old man! That's hot! - Watch your language! - Shit! You try it! Shit! Sir, you really think I left you cuz of money? You didn't belong under me from the beginning. Being on TV... Expensive cars and clothes... They were all useless. Like you said, a hunter should live in the mountains. That's the hunter's life. Detective SHIN! How long did it take you to make sergeant? Around 10 years. How can you get special promotions? I thought you had no interest in that. Maybe I can run a station in the countryside like this, later. You wanna stay here after everything that's happened? It's still better than Seoul. The people are nicer and stuff. Why'd you become a cop? To make a living, of course. But I never thought I'd be out chasing a wild boar... It's not the life I pictured. If you can't live the way you think, think the way you live. Who said that? I just made it up. - Strange? - Yup. What the hell. Man-bae! - Shoot it! - Shoot! Come! Come on! It's stuck! Run away! Go to Man-bae! Sir! What's happening to me. Get up, sir! Hurry! - Pull the rope on the drop trap! - Get up! Let's go! Hurry! What's wrong? I can't go any further. Go without me. - Get up! There's no time! - Let's go! No! I'm a goner. - Get up! - Hurry! Everyone will die! I'll cover for you! Shut up! Let's go! Just get up! Get up! - Stand up! - Leave him! He can't get up. Let's go. No way! Get up! Let's go! Hurry! Get up! Let's go! Run! Take care, Miss. That boar's right on our tails! Get rid of it! Don't do this! Shut up! It will kill us, then go down to the village. Officer KiM! I'll take him down and call for back up. You lure the boar away. Wait! Why me, sir! You want all of us to die together, then? This is your chance for a special promotion! - You could be promoted! - But... Think about it. You promise? Go! Think of your unborn baby! Okay! I'll do it. - Hold that up high and run! - I'll go with you! Wait! If something happens to me, tell my wife I love her! - Go! - Please tell her! Over here, bastard! What the hell! That crazy bitch! Help me! Take your pants off! Don't let her catch you! God damn it! Oh man! Are you okay? Yeah. Hurry up! This way! I can't run anymore! Then why'd you follow me! Keep pushing it down! Push! Push! Faster! Faster! Faster! Head down! Now! Stop! Stop! Run! He didn't see us? - It's gone, right? - Be quiet. Go up faster! Stay back! It can't come way up here, right? I can't see it. It'll wait for us till we get down. Detective SHiN that bastard! We can't let it destroy the village! Then what do we do? We kill it. How? We don't have any guns! It's up the mountain. We have to catch the boar! The damn beast attacked town hall! But I stood up against it! When I pulled the gun out to shoot... - Go get him! - Yes, sir! Attention! Now! Any word on KiM? His phone's been off since yesterday. How can this happen in Sam-mae-ri, the crimeless village! Get the bike! That good for nothing... - Capt. YOO! - Run Officer PARK! - The elevator! - What about it? Drop trap! Drop trap! You take this cub and lure the beast under the elevator. Then I'll go up there. When you go under there, I'll drop the elevator and crush it. - What If I get crushed, too? - Just jump out in time! Okay. Be careful. Go down here? I'll go up and you go that way. How can I go down this way! - Put this on! - There's no way down! - Go down, now! - But How? Hurry! Why do I always have to lure! Timing is important! This is insane! Eat this, bastard! Go up! Hurry! Almost there! Get ready! Hurry up! Son of a bitch! It's coming! Get ready! There's your baby! Is it under there? Officer! Is it there? Is it there? Got it! Drop it, now! Hurry! Yes! We caught it! We did it! We caught it! Drop trap worked! Wait. It could try and pull something. There should be a sledge hammer around. Dynamite! - Let's blow It up with this. - Wait. Where are you going! Why'd you bring that out? It can't even walk anymore. You're right. Its legs are crushed. Damn! Let's go down. Headquarters will do the rest. - Let's go. - Wait! We should put it out of its misery. What? For the record, I caught the boar. The wick's kinda short. Oh no! Run! Hurry! How do you feel? Nervous? I don't know. It's like that at first. - Is It a boy or a girl? - A boy. Hope he doesn't have my wife's temper. You get promoted and have a son. Must be nice. - I guess. - Of course. - Mi-young! - Hello. - Hi, hon. - You okay? I'm fine. Thank god. - Where's the little guy? - Our baby? - With Mother. - Mom... - You came? - Let me see. Daddy's here. - He's your daddy! - What's this? Hold him, hon! Are you okay? Hon! Are you okay? Where's the boar? What did you blow it up with? Well... ah... I'll explain later. I told them everything. You couldn't wait? Geeze! How about becoming a hunter? No way! I almost died. The newspapers are going crazy. - Why? - Trying to interview you! Let's go! I'm getting the special promotion, right? Since it's not a murder case... Capt. Can you gather up the boar's remains before nightfall? You heard Detective SHiN. It's my day off, sir. Get me my club! But, sir! Last one to the station! A SHiN Jung-won film What? Where am I? Slept well, Duk-goo? Who are you ma'am? Ma'am? I told you to call me mommy. Boys are all the same. Call me mommy. Mommy. M... m... mommy. Mommy. Louder! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! I'm sorry, mommy! I'm sorry, mommy! Mommy! I love you, mommy.
