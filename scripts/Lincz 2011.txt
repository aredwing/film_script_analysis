Get down! - Go to mom. - Don't move! Adam Grad! Don't move! Get down! Face down! - He did nothing! - Easy! - Let him go! - Quiet, watch the kid! Watch the head. What did you hit him with? - What was at hand. - What exactly? A shovel. - I'm rebuilding... - You hit him as he lay down? Several times. We're angry.. - With the edge? - No, the handle... ...two or three times... Everyone can confirm. You mean your brothers, right? His eyes were open, he was looking at us. We left him in the field. We found him nearthe cemetery in the bushes. He could crawl there. I don't know. His head was smashed into pieces. We left him in the field. Alive. We found him nearthe cemetery He was dead already See you. Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. - How can I help you? - Ma'am... a hot day today wife's pension's late... Would you cuff it for me? Sorry the boss forbids. Talk to him when he comes. I can't. You can't? Oh,too bad... The heat is terrible. Oh, God! Alina, it's okay.. I'll call an ambulance. Did you call the police? If you don't report, he'll come again. They sentence him, you'll have a peace of mind. What if he gets out? - Will I live in fear? - He gets those who fear him. If you report, you show that you aren't afraid. Oh, God! Hania, who did this to you? Who, the fuck, did it? I certify Adam Grad. Yeah... Although there's a corpse, no one killed. So far we know that a neighbor helped them, and maybe an in-law with a friend. We can easily press the charges. The woman from Kruty called. She said that no one came for inspection. If so, she'll sell it to the media. How come? There was blood at the crime scene. Testimonies show he was beaten up in the field then crawled and bled to death by the cemetery So, do the inspection... ...and let's get arrest warrants. Aren't we waiting for the results? What for? We have the perpetrators already He took a shortcut to my house. Here Kopera and Grad caught him and began beating. - Your house's there? - Yes. - But it's a longer way - It only looks so. But by the lake it's easier to flee unnoticed. - You saw when they began the beating? - Out the window. They beat him for a minute. After they left, he's still moving. It was dark and you saw him moving? No, it was before 9 p.m. I have good sight, he's moving. - You saw the blood here? - Yes, I guess here... Perhaps... I don't know... but it was here... They've agreed what to say ...beat him here, he bled there, later; alone... it's not a homicide but a battery with fatal effects. As for the locals, I'm impressed. - We're done. - That's all you have to say? What about our men, how long will you keep them? - You've promised to tell us, dammit! - I can't. - Investigation is on. - Who can? Visits aren't allowed. I have a small child! What law is that? Don't! - Calm down! - You're the power to people?! Where were you when he's marauding? You're afraid! You come at night as political agents used to! You won't leave. - Hold them! - They won't get fucking alive! - Do something, dammit! - Like what? Run over them? Please, remain calm! People, order! You want another tragedy?! You won't help them this way! Get out! I guess, it's your turn. I'm from the prosecutor's office. Murder investigation is on, all were arrested, you know that. - Behave like humans! - You treat us as such? - Fucking political agents! - Order! Quiet! They're simple people, they don't know much... ...if they need a lawyer; when to visit, who can explain it? We'll start visits tomorrow. Attorney is from an office, unless you hire one. - What are the charges? - How long it takes? No courage to tell us? Murder; filing for provisional arrest warrant. You want to make them murderers? Victim was hit many times with dangerous tools. For the court it's not a battery it's a murder: Facts don't matter: Otherwise, we give them a moral right... Do you want to go home? You go fishing? I'm not asking for a permit... I also fish without a permit. Confess and all of you are free till the hearing. Summer's hot, you can sit by the lake, come on... - But, I said everything. - You said nothing so far! You dragged him into bushes, fucked up his head! -I don't understand. I didn't. - Did he fly there? Stupid lie! We left him in the field... I don't get it... how he...? What's your name?! - Your fucking name'?! - l\/Iaroin... Grad... - What's your address?! - Kruty 7. Did you, on July 1, batter and kill Zaranek? Yes or no? You understand the question?! Yes... 'Yes,' you fucking understand, or 'yes' you killed Zaranek?! - Fuck! Marcin, answer me! -I don't know... Help for the Arrested There was a tragedy in this quiet village, six locals lynched their countryman, a long-time recidivist. We aren't sure, but we do everything to... ...we form a community people are close... ...we'll help. - How much money so far? - We didn't count, but... From co-workers... You face homicide with extreme cruelty it's 10 years each, if you get a good lawyer: I bet you can't, so you get 15, what's more, you impede the investigation, Do you understand? What do you want, ma'am? Good morning! Maria Lubienska, attorney Ml: Grad, you don't have to answer any questions. Why are my clients questioned without their lawyer's presence? In spite of such failure, I declare to have serious doubts about the testimonies. I infer for re-hearing in my presence. Good morning, Basia. Lucky me, I made it for dinner; right? Want a drink? I stopped by.. to fix the radio, as I promised... Still broken, huh? Basia... I'll need money okay? I'll boil some water: Where is it? Same place? Please, I don't want to snoop around. The postman hasn't come yet He has, Basia. Where's the money? He wasn't here. No one came. Where? ...company that won the tender will start the works this week... Jesus sweet and Mary.. Bruzdowo 11 My name's Ewa Oldak... Why do you, fucking, get involved? Get out, or I'll call my husband! Call back and tell them you misheard... ...that she fell and she screamed. Get out! Yes, everything is fine. I'm sorry Your husband will fix it. And mind your own fucking business. OPERATING ROOM DO NOT ENTER You mother is conscious. Did you call the police? They noted that she fell on the stairs. See, how happy he is, brave to trace a fox and bark it up so well... no one will cross the fence, a real guard. You'll break the chain.. sit straight. Rascal? He wants to hide from the rain. Is your mother home? - We need to talk. - Nothing to talk about. Yes, there is. Jagoda... You took Basia without my consent. - She should go home. - Over my dead body 'Dead body' you say? Don't push it. You wanted to rob me, didn't you? Fine. She's back, I forget it. You have children to live for; so don't start with 'dead bodies] You fucker! Get out! I'll call the police! Shut the fuck up! You too! Sit down! I wanted to be nice, but with you it's fucking impossible. She comes home. If not, then be afraid. Explain it to your mother that it'd be better: You're mature, clever girl. Get out, or I'll let him go! You'll be afraid to leave the house. Go to ER. Report the assault and battery and we'll look for him. Drive alone... What if he comes back? - Leave my mom and kids? - My partner will be here, and I'll look around the area. Do you drink often? Don't exaggerate with injuries. If all women after fights qualified for abuse, who'd go in the field? What are you saying? I've been working in the country for 15 years. Women take men under the roof then they want to get rid of them. Okay where can I sue you? At the Chamber of Physicians. Each provincial capital has its branch. No permanent address, lives illegally by the dams. Individual complaint procedure to the E CHR. European Court of Human Rights ...on constant surveillance. At /east 3 shifts, 2 men each, this is half of the entire county You need an army battalion to get someone here. Those guys fucked up the old man. So tough, eh? Order! Don't move! Don't move! Over here! What's going on? You want a disciplinary punishment? - He jumped at us. - One man, at all of you? You return it voluntarily or beat the shit out of you? Adam Grad... You get out of here. Take your things. Hold on. I hold on. You can do it. Do you hear me? You go to jail for murder; doesn't matter; whether bandit, or not. He's the same rights as you, understand? I fell down... That's... nothing... it's... Alright, alright. Minister issued release order; you're going home. Thanks to the defendant court changed the charges into a battery with a dangerous tool. Grad's received 2 years in prison, suspended for 3. Charewicz and Oldak got half year sentence, suspended for 2 years for desecration of corpse. Kopera was acquitted. - Do you want to congratulate us? - Certainly But, we'll meet at the appeal hearing. Did you inform your clients that it's only the first half? An appeal gives you nothing. There's no new evidence. That's irrelevant. Offended pride veils your reasoning? At bandit's expense you want to imprison these people? You're partially right. The case became too famous to let it go, right? Now, I'm only interested in respect for the law. A man was killed, no matter what scumbag he's still a man. And the consequences of homicide are... ...absent You think they had a choice? In the face of law, it's irrelevant. Good morning. Did you see Rascal? He's always nearby - Went to fuck, he'll return. - See where the bitches are. I had the manual somewhere. Maybe Adam moved it. Thanks, I'll tell Krysia to thank you. Come on, let her have it for vacation. A wedding gift, after baptism we didn't use it. You'll, for the next one, right? Yes, maybe we'll go on some holidays... - Coffee? - No, I have to help packing. We need to settle something. You won't dare in front of the people! Get out of my yard! Mind your own business, it's between us. Get out! Do you know what she did to me? This whore robbed me. Jagoda, go. You've no fucking idea whom you're dealing with. I slay you, then the kid, and your woman! Go to your mother. I'll be back, slay all of you whores, and burn you down! Show it to me. The bandage... Zaranek was here. We drove him out. - Where did he flee? - Maybe to Bruzdowo. Failed here, so seeks revenge there. Fuck. - Get in, we'll get him down the road. - Easy! Get... get fucking in! Go back to work. What did I say? Zaranek slashed Adam. They drove him out, but he's coming here. You can't park here! The name of the callelt..? Okay.. Yes. I've been attacked. Do you want to report the assault? Fill it out. I'm not here to write! Thug threatens to kill my family! Go and arrest him, fuck! Lower down your voice, please. See the commandant. He's in charge of that. Over there. Right... They called from Bruzdowo. He's coming mad... he's beaten, They're asking for help. They fear he'll attack them. I don't care where you arrest him! I just want peace! Now, I have more than a dozen of entries. Drunkard tortures his wife. I sent one patrol, for he's still there and still beating, not like Zaranek, who maybe goes to Bruzdowo or vanishes in the woods. So, you're leaving us with that, right? I have one oar for all calls and for todays fair in Dobromosc. Ml: Grad... we'll Search for him. With that report to ER. Do the forensic exam! Is chief there? Gone, how come? I know it's Friday Okay With the officer on duty of provincial commander; please... Yes urgent... What is it? Got the cut harvesting? Harvest hasn't begun yet. But Sir; this is an emergency.. As per law, fair needs a patrol. it's the only car I have. If I don't get another, I won't cover the interventions, Sure, I can cope. They can get on bikes... I apologize for the spiteful remark. ...slight injuries. See, no point in getting frustrated... In fact, a woman called today; Zaranek threatened hen Zaranek Jaroslaw, age 61? The same one? The same. What's with you? Can't you deal with an old man? What did they say? Well, are they coming? Someone was by the house. Dog's gone. Is grandma alone? I won't go back there by myself. Mom! Stay at home. I'll be right there. Pawel, we'll take a ride to Kruty Where's your mother? She ran home, grandma is there alone. Come on, we'll block his way You go back inside. Wait till we get back! Stop! Enough! Fuck! That's enough! Three fit men, manual workers, against a 60 year old, who weighed less than 14Olb. Armed with shovels and springs, they had over an elderly man, even armed with a hatchet, the physical advantage that they could safely subdue him, without killing. One stroke with a spade is enough to take someone's life. They hit several times. They hit him not to overpower but to kill. The court reclassified the act due to social pressure and decisions of the highest, at that time, state factors. The question is - how it relates to the independence of the court? ...court that should uphold the law in the form that is valid in the Republic of Poland. Should Polish village change, by the court's decision, into the place of lawlessness and vendetta? One neighbor beats the other one, the first one, with his mates, kills him with impunity in revenge. Husband beats wife, her father and brother beat him to death as a punishment in his own house, And then, before the court their defenders will refer to hereby exceptional case. You mother fucker! You piece of shit! Fuck you! Leave him, too late... He has croaked. That bastard doesn't even deserve a funeral. You go to bed, to your homes. He won't come here anymore. After the repeal of the prior sentence, accepting the order of the reasons of the sentence at the request of Court of Appeal and in acceptance of his orders the District Court sentences Adam, Darius, and Marcin Grad to 5 years of imprisonment. The conviction of the Court of the First Resort in case Charewicz - Oldak accused of desecration of corpses, to 6 months in prison suspended for 3 years, is maintained. After verdict validation the court releases the details of the sentence. I'll testify fuck... I'll tell all. What did you say when you came with Oldak? They'll say you report your in-law to save your ass. I got twice for booting a corpse, but you did him good. You're right, I won't grass on you. Your daughter will! Are you with him? Do you want me to confess instead of them? Decide, who you are with. If your father pleads guilty he gets at least 10 years. What about his health? He'll get a good care. The prison stay is better than the remand. Decision from the provincial station... Of course, they investigating the breach of duty ...the case is shocking, for in general opinion pastor's work is recognized and accepted. What evidence is there to remove the priest? Parishioners protest at the seat of the archdiocese. ...from Bart/et for Events, Pawel... According to families of the detained, police arrested... Clean this up! ...cry for help, neglected locals lynched the terrorizing... policemen accused of breach of duty were sentenced to 6 months, suspended for 2 years, with immediate dismissal from the service. No one cares we only had one police car to back up fair my requests for the another car were... ignored ...because of the weekend. Turn it down! Fuck! ...a scapegoat for the media... - Have you seen Marcin? - He ran to Bruzdowo. Please check it whether it complies with the statements. I must inform you of criminal liability for false testimony /certify Renata Grad. 'Yes,' you understand the fucking question?! Or 'yes' you battered and killed Zaranek?! Marcin! Marcin, don't move! I won't go back there. Jesus! Marcin! /certify Renata Grad. It's obvious we can't do the investigation anew. Otherwise... So the prosecutor will bring the indictment. False testimony in order to defend a husband. She's been informed she can face 3 years. Still not enough for you? If we don't want an appeal against the investigation... ...well, indeed, they have good lawyers. Thanks to Lubienska, Grad brothers received a pardon from the President suspended for 10 years. If they commit a crime during that time they'll return to prison to do the ful/ sentence. Renata Grad faces charges of 3 years prison sentence for fa/se evidence. Her trial continues. English dialogues: Aneta Tatarczuk.
