We have millions of messages email and databases with secrets people have to know. About what? Classified information. Independent Leak was founded by a woman, Angela King. She was murdered, right? Attracted the attention too. Where did you keep those emails? I have. I have a copy on site and one copy safety elsewhere hidden. I'll make public those emails and then disappear. I'm with you.

A Senate investigation probably will be announced later. It's over, Russell. I can not hide it ... After this surprising twist situation, The International Tribunal shall again against Van Der Bilt for violation of the embargo.

However, a recording video secret reveals that Mr Schwarz could have been victim of a murder to avoid exposing these emails. Today, many companies They are trying to rewrite history and change the truth. As Mao, Lenin and others who used propaganda for political purposes, corporations now control images for commercial purposes. We are on the brink of a new world where the objective facts can be altered in the name Public Relations by companies that are larger states. "The media are the most powerful entity in the world. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and make the guilty innocent. And that's power and controlling the minds of the masses. " These are words of Malcolm X.
