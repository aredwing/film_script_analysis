JOE: Whoo-haw! JESS: Let him know who you are, boy! Yeah, boy! You got him,Joe! You got him! JOE: Whoa,whoa. JESS: That's it,Joe! WlLLlS: Kid looks pretty good. JESS: Well, hell... Yeah, I taught him everything he knows. JESS: Whoo! WlLLlS: How's the war? JESS: Well, it was all right. How's prison? WlLLlS: Glad to be out. JESS: I'll bet. Dock still in? WlLLlS: They might just let him out of jail some day... if he'd stop trying to escape. JESS: You would have done pretty good there... if you hadn't pulled leather. JOE: Like hell I did. I ain't never touched a saddle horn in my life. Howdy,Willis. WlLLlS: Little brotherJoe done went and shot up like a weed. JOE: It happens that way. You wanna try a ride? WlLLlS: Hell, no. I leave that to your big brotherJess here. Say,what is the going rate these days... for getting your brains beat out on the saddle? JESS: Same as always. $1.00 a day, beans, and hay. JOE: How long you been out? WlLLlS: About a year. -Doing what? -White boy picking cotton. JOE: Ma's gonna be happy to see you! Hey, Ma! Will's home! WlLLlS: Pa around? JESS: Oh, no. I ain't seen him in weeks. He's off chasing money ponds andfritter trees, as always. WlLLlS: That'd be James W. Newton, all right. Everybody says he's a good man. Just can't nobody figure out what he's goodfor. [Sizzling] WlLLlS: Mm-mmm. I been dreaming about your squirrel dumplings... forfour years now. MA: That's the last one, son. You almostfinished breaking that Ferguson colt? JOE: Yes, ma'am. He ain't that tough. I reckon we'll have about $10 by the end of the week. JESS: Yeah, he still owes us fourfrom last week. MA: You gonna go get it? JESS: Yeah, I will. JOE: Willis,you gonna stay on? You can help me and Jess break a few horses. MA: You let Willis finish his dinner. WlLLlS: Naw, little brother, I'm just staying a bit. Besides, I ain't horse crazy like you boys. JESS: It's nice to see you ain't changed,Willis. WlLLlS: You should've seen her, Mom. We was all set up. Talking about getting married, living on the 40 acres... the whole bit. And then some old jealous rat went and told her old man... that I'd been in a penitentiary, and that was it. Ffft. Cut me off, couldn't see her no more. Oh, he still wanted me to stay on and work his crop. Hell, I was the best cotton picker he ever had. Just didn't want his beautiful daughter... hooked up with an ex-con. A man gonna tell me I ain't good enough for his daughter... but I'm good enough to work his crop? I said the hell with you. MA: No, it ain'tfair, son. Maybe you should've stayed on, tried to work it out. How? How, Mom? What, like I tried to work it out up in Cottonwood... when them folks that known me all my life... stood up and testified against me in a court of law... and I ain't done nothing? I'm gonna work some things out all right. You just watch me. And if it ain'tfair when it's all said and done... it's gonna be unfair on my side of the fence. [Fiddle music] GlRLS: [Singing] Guide us to Thy side, Lord. Guide us to Thy side. The pathway of the righteous... Can have no earthly load. What good are gold and silver... When the devil wins your soul? Guide us to Thy side, Lord. Guide us to Thy side. Straight wages God won't pay you... His hours,they are long... But He helps those that help themselves... And protects the weak from strong. [Slow jazz piano music] GLASSCOCK: So where do you know this fella from? SLlM: We were in the pen together. His brother stole some cotton and drug him down with him. He didn't do nothing. The kid's green, but he's got guts. This here is my business associate. How do you do? Brentwood Glasscock. WlLLlS: Willie Reed. -Nice to meet you. -You as well. SLlM: Been a slight change in plans,fellas. I went out there and got it all set up. Going in at 12:00 noon instead of 12:00 midnight. GLASSCOCK: Slim, I didn't travel 300 miles... to stick a gun in someone's face. You can hold the horses. A night job is too much work anyhow. I ain't afraid of hard work. SLlM: This'll be a milk run. -Mr. Glasscock. -Hmm? BARTENDER: Chief wanted y'all to have a drink on him. It's Napoleon brandy. GLASSCOCK: Thanks. Heard they hit another pool south of town last week. BARTENDER: They sure did. WlLLlS: Who's they? GLASSCOCK: Chief Bakenron. One of the Osage millionaires. BARTENDER: Last year,they wouldn't even let him in here... but, uh, policy's changed. WlLLlS: Yeah? Why's that? GLASSCOCK: He bought the place. WlLLlS: Oil, huh? GLASSCOCK: Mm-hmm. SLlM: To Oklahoma, gentlemen-- the Sooner state. The sooner we get out of here, the richer we're gonna be. You ain't gonna drink that? WlLLlS: Nah. SLlM: Ahh. Lordy. lndians drink anything. GLASSCOCK: I prefer to go in at night. There's more time to do your work and a lot less people. SLlM: There's an easy way to do this and a hard way. Long as I'm leading this outfit, we do it my way. WlLLlS: Which way is that? SLlM: Why don't y'all relax? I got this sheriff's pecker in my pocket. We just cut him in on the take,that's all. GLASSCOCK: I still prefer nights. WlLLlAMS: Thanks a lot,Alvin. See you next year. ALVlN: Thank you, Mr. Williams. -Howdy. -Howdy. ALVlN: Can I help you, sir? [Laughs] This here's a bank robbery, and I want all your money. Hands up, everybody. Come on. GLASSCOCK: Howdy. Do us both a favor and just keep walking. SLlM: Lock him in that vault and get that boy out of there. MAN: Come on! Let's go! GLASSCOCK: Why is this happening, Slim? [Gunshot] SLlM: Double-crossing bastard! Damn him to hell! GLASSCOCK: Hyah! Hyah! [Gunshot] Hyah! Come on! Hyah! Hyah! WlLLlS: Oh... [Whinnies] [Squishy footsteps] [Knocking lightly] GLASSCOCK: Yeah? WlLLlS: Open up. It's me,Willis. GLASSCOCK: You all right? WlLLlS: Yeah. GLASSCOCK: Anybody see you come up here? WlLLlS: No. I come up the back. GLASSCOCK: That's my wife. Avis,this is Will Reed. WlLLlS: Howdy. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. AVlS: Charmed. WlLLlS: Sorry to wake you tonight. Well,they got Slim. GLASSCOCK: I know. Newspaper didn't say nothing about him being dead,though. WlLLlS: What'd we get? GLASSCOCK: What'd you get? WlLLlS: Nothing. I got out alive. GLASSCOCK: Well, if all we got's mine... it's not a hell of a lot. Some damn victory bonds. If we get expenses for Slim... there's not more than a few thousand there. It's not worth all that aggravation. WlLLlS: I'm with you on the idea of these night jobs. I figure that damn Jesse James routine we pulled-- hell,that was over with at the turn of the century. GLASSCOCK: I tried to tell that idiot... there's less risk in night jobs. Especially if you work the smaller banks. WlLLlS: But we're gonna get the big banks... 'cause that's where the money's at. Now,the difference is we gotta do it right. Yeah,we gotta scout our locations. We gotta get the best cars, gotta keep new tires on 'em... and plan our routes. I can take care of getting in and getting out. You got the nitroglycerin, right? GLASSCOCK: Oh,yeah. WlLLlS: So that's where you keep that stuff? GLASSCOCK: Yeah. Avis is ratherfond of keeping it under the bed. Aren't you? These look, uh, promising. GLASSCOCK: None of those are traceable. I suppose I could give you, uh... seventy cents on the dollar. -Ninety. -Eighty. And I promise never to tell anybody where they came from. GLASSCOCK: Eighty would be good. WlLLlS: Eighty-five would be better. We promise never to rob your little bank. -Deal. -Deal. [Chuckling] BANKER: You know, I'm retiring next month, and... I've got some information here... that might be valuable to boys in your line of work. It's a few square-door safes... I know about in this part of the country. Of course, it'll mean a little investment on your part. MAN: Thank you, ma'am. [Cash register rings] LOUlSE: Can I help you? WlLLlS: I like that Red Cross pin you got there,Avis. -Thanks. -You a nurse? AVlS: I was. That's how I met Brent. One day he was just another patient. And then I ran off with him... and here we are casing a bank. WlLLlS: You know how he takes all them powders? He ain't sick or nothing, is he? AVlS: Nah. It's just him. I wear this for luck. WlLLlS: How's she look, Glass? GLASSCOCK: The list is genuine. WlLLlS: I knew that old man was an honest criminal. GLASSCOCK: We can punch through the drum. The box is an old rotten Packer. WlLLlS: Mm-hmm. You can blow her with the grease? GLASSCOCK: Oh,yeah. Anything with a square door. I'll take it off there in one pop. WlLLlS: All right. GLASSCOCK: What else is on that list? WlLLlS: We got 41 banks here. Now I figure we wait... till these marks are flush with that harvest money... and then we take them one by one. GLASSCOCK: That's good, huh? AVlS: Very good. Who's gonna handle security? WlLLlS: Now,we need security? GLASSCOCK: While we're in the bank... someone's gotta be outside and watch our backs. We'll find somebody. [Starts engine] I reckon I know some fellas we can count on. JESS: Would you look at this? JOE: My goodness. WlLLlS: Welcome to Omaha, boys. JOE: Howdy,Willis. WlLLlS: What do you say, little brother? JOE: You look good. WlLLlS: Yeah? Feel good. JESS: Look at Willis the city slicker. WlLLlS: You like that, boy? JESS: Well,yeah. WlLLlS: What'd you boys bring all that horse stuff for? JOE: You said you had a job for us. WlLLlS: I do have a job for you. It's just not that type of job. WlLLlS: What do you think of Omaha, boys? JESS: Looks good. WlLLlS: Everything looks good from the seat of a Studebaker. JESS: Oh, my! Hello, darling! Say good-bye to Daddy there and say hello to me! Oh, my goodness. JOE: Ay. JESS: I like this town. JESS: Look out! [Honks horn] WlLLlS: Yep. It cost 1,900 off the showroom floor... but this one's an even two because of these custom wheels. Think you can handle a car like this,Joe? JOE: Couldn't do no worse. WlLLlS: Good. That's part of your job. Let's get you boys dressed. JOE: I don't know about this. JESS: Let's string him along for a little while. WlLLlS: You're looking sharp. Look at him. Look at him. CATHERlNE: What do you do for a living? JESS: What do you do for a living? CATHERlNE: I'm a manicurist. JESS: You are a manicurist. Well, all right. What do you think of these nails right here? CATHERlNE: You need to come in. JESS: Yeah,they need some help, don't they? Don't you look all spiffed up. JOE: Could say the same about you. JESS: Let me introduce y'all to these two fine ladies. This here is, uh, Catherine, and this is Madeline. This is Joe and Willis. CATHERlNE: So,what business are you boys in? JOE: That's a mighty fine question. Exactly what kind of businessman are you,Willis? WlLLlS: Damn successful. Now,y'all coming? JESS: Would you like to join us for dinner? -Um, sure. -OK. JESS: Well, all righty. [Light piano music] JESS: Now, I don't tell a lot of people this... but I am goodfriends with Pancho Villa. Now, it's the truth. It's true. He comes into Texas all the time. I go down to Mexico. We drink together. He's always catching hell in the papers. I'm telling you he's a great man. Great man, Pancho Villa. Friend of mine. You ever had a steak so thick? Mm-mmm. No way,Willis. I ain't never broke the law in my life. Saddle's hard, but at least it's honest. I ain't never broke the law in my life, neither... and they gave me three years for it. What about them watermelons and chickens? That hog? WlLLlS: I ain't talking about that. JOE: You're talking about taking people's money. No, not people's money. The bank's money. Banks have been dealing dirt to our people... since before we was born, little brother. It's time we dealt some back. Farmers got their money in them banks. lnsurance companies. See, all the banks is insured now. And that's who takes the loss, and, hell... they're the biggest crooks of them all. We are just little thieves stealingfrom the big thieves... that's all. [Jess whistling] JESS: You turn the little Baptist yet? We've got two pieces of cake over there... and they do have a friend. Just don'tfigure up to me, that's all. JESS: Pa's been doing his clean-living routine. It's rubbing off on the kid. WlLLlS: Yeah. Well, if the kid ain't up for it... It ain't like I'm afraid or nothing. JOE: How's it look? JESS: Pretty dead. JOE: Yep. Only an idiot would be out on a night like this. [Both chuckling] JOE: I don't know,Jess. Somebody comes, I don't think I can pull this trigger. JESS: Listen,Joe... we're gonna do what we talked about. We're not gonna kill anybody. That's why we got these loaded up with birdshot. Just gonna get this over with. Then we'll get back to that cake. -All right? -All right. JESS: All right. GLASSCOCK: You light the fuse right after you pour it. And you gotta pour it very steady... 'cause if you get a gap in that liquid... it's gonna blow off crooked... and jam up. See, dynamite blows out in all directions. But nitro... shoots straight out. Anything that's not nailed down in here... is going right out that door over there. WlLLlS: How long you been doing this? GLASSCOCK: Too damn long. According to the odds and the gods... you only get to make one mistake with this... then they walk around the edge of the crater. And if they find a finger or a toe... well,that's what they bury. We should probably leave now. JOE: What if they blow themselves up in there? JESS: Well, I reckon you'll be the first to know. WlLLlS: Ha ha ha ha ha! Whoo! WOMAN: Stop that noise! Who are you, and what are you doing down there? JESS: Go back to bed, lady. I got a fire siren up here. Do you hear me? JESS: There ain't no fire. WOMAN: And if you don't tell me what you're doing... I'm going to crank it up. [Scoffs] JESS: You touch the damn siren, woman, I'm going to blow-- JOE: Sorry to wake you, ma'am. We're repairmen. We're down here trying to fix a lock. Oh, no,you're not! Not at 2:00 in the morning! JESS: You touch the siren... I'm going to blow your whole building to kingdom come! [Siren] Hey! I said turn that off! You're bank robbers, that's what you are! Somebody catch these men! They just robbed the bank! JESS: Don't make me come up there! JOE: You're mean,you know that? WOMAN: Somebody stop these men! They've just robbed the bank! JESS: The whole town's going to be down here in a minute. -Hey! -What? WlLLlS: Get in there and carry that silver. We're getting it all. -Whoo! Where? -Behind the smoke! WOMAN: Catch them! They robbed the bank! That's my money in that bank! JESS: Well, it's our money now! WOMAN: No! JESS: Go back to bed! All y'all! All is well! All is well! [Gunshot] [Gunshot] WlLLlS: Come on! Keep your speed up, boy! JOE: My leg's shot! WlLLlS: When I was your age... I could've passed you running backwards with that load,Joe. Get it all? JOE: There's still a calendar in there. JESS: I got them idiots shooting at each other! WlLLlS: Hee hee! GLASSCOCK: It's a hell of a way to make a living. [Gunshot] WlLLlS: Whoo! [Gunshot] WlLLlS: Whoo-ha! I want to ship this back to Texas, miss. Well,whatever you say,Tex. Ain't you a little young to be running a hotel? Ain't you a little young to stay here all by yourseIf? Yeah. WlLLlS: Good evening, ma'am. LOUlSE: What can I getfor you? WlLLlS: You got any out-of-town papers? LOUlSE: Oh, no, sorry. You might want to try the depot. WlLLlS: How about that one right there? -The Police Gazette? -Yeah. Sounds good. WlLLlS: Let me get thatfor you. I was going to say only criminals read the tabloids... but you don't look like any criminal I ever met. WlLLlS: You'd be right about that. -Nickel for the paper? -Yes, please. WlLLlS: So... what's fun to do in Omaha? Well,you could chew gum. It's been nice chatting, but I have to close up now. [Playing] WlLLlS: Looks like we're going the same place. Piece of Wrigley's? [Louise laughs] -Hey, Louise. -Kat, how are you doing? WlLLlS: Howdy. Will Reed. Oldfriend of Louise's here. Hi there. KAT: So, how do you two know each other? LOUlSE: Well... that is a wild story. I'll let you tell it. WlLLlS: Boy,that is a wild story, isn't it? [Laughs] Matter of fact, it was 16 years ago to the week. Now, I was frog gigging down in Gracy Creek. I come around the corner... and who do I see bogged down to her knees in mud... with a frog stuck on the end of her gig... but Miss Louise here? [Both laugh] Boy,we got a lot of catching up to do. LOUlSE: Yeah, I guess we do. [Laughter] WlLLlS: Louise--frog gigging. [Laughs] [Jazz music playing] LOUlSE: Do you want a match? WlLLlS: No,thank you. I make it a habit to stay too busy. Busy doing what? Giggingfrogs? No. I'm an oilman. Really? You have oil wells and all that? Yep. Working on one right now. She's a real wildcat. You have quite a line, Mr. Reed. WlLLlS: My friends call me Willis, Louise. You ever heard of this place called the Argosy Ballroom? LOUlSE: Yeah. What do you say you and I get on over there... on Saturday night? I have to tell you something. WlLLlS: What's that? I have a son. -Really? -Yeah. What's his name? His name is Lewis. He's ten years old. His father died in the war. Why, I love kids. Why don't you bring him along? We'll go to the picture show instead. I think he would like that very much. And you? [Footsteps] ARTHUR: There you are. Sorry I'm late. LOUlSE: Arthur. This is Mr. Reed. WlLLlS: Will Reed. Pleased to meet you. ARTHUR: Arthur Adams. LOUlSE: Arthur owns the cigar stand where I work. ARTHUR: You ready to go? SlNGER ON RADlO: Right or wrong... I'll always love you. Though you're gone... I can'tforget. [Ukulele playing] [Sniffs] There's more money in that pile than Pa made in his whole life. WlLLlS: You got that right. JOE: As long as you're telling Louise you're an oilman... why don't you just be an oilman? Hell, I will be soon. If you boys are smart, you're going to invest with me. [Yawns] Oil, huh? Well...good luck to the both of you. Any money I make I'm putting into stocks and bonds. ln what? Silk stockings and bonded whiskey. At least till I get myseIf killed. You want Avis to carry your share? No. [Knock on door] Oh. WlLLlS: Put that thing away. Nobody knows us around here. Yeah,who's that? DOCK: The law. Lookingfor a bunch of no-good Newtons. WlLLlS: So,youfinally wore them tracking dogs down. [Both laugh] JESS: God almighty, you son of a bitch! Aiee! [Laughter] When did they finally let you out? DOCK: Let? Well, hell, I escaped. WlLLlS: Goddamn good to see you, Hoss. DOCK: Good to see you. JESS: Hee hee hee hee! DOCK: Well,who's this? Joe. -Your brother. -Joe? DOCK: Joe, I haven't seen you in a long time! JESS: Damned if this don't call for a celebration. WlLLlS: Whoo! DOCK: You weren't lying in that letter you sent me. WlLLlS: Hell, no. Got 5,000 in cash and 3,000 in bonds. DOCK: To hell with picking cotton. JOE: Goddamn it,Willis. JESS: Oh, "God damn you,Willis." [All talking at once] JOE: You got my hair,you-- JESS: Ha ha ha! Whoo-hoo! Hey! WlLLlS: What about Willy Hart? LEWlS: William Hart's good, but I like Tom Mix better. WlLLlS: Tom Mix? Them outfits he wears is kind of fruity, don't you think? LEWlS: He can rope and ride better than any of them. I want to be a cowboy when I grow up... but Mother says I have to stay in school. WlLLlS: Your ma's right about that. You don't stay in school, you'll end up picking cotton. That don't sound like too much fun, does it? LEWlS: Nah. WlLLlS: What's next? LEWlS: Could we get a chocolate soda? LOUlSE: Lewis. WlLLlS: How about a triple chocolate soda... with a big old scoop of ice cream on the side? That sound good? I'll race youfor it. Ready, set, go. Watch it. There's your mom. [Laughs] JESS: Whoo! I got 'em,Joe! Looks like a 6-pointer. JOE: Yeah. DOCK: Some hunting season this turned out to be. WlLLlS: I'll tell you what, boys. We hit every bank on this list... and I guarantee we going to make enough to retire. Then y'all get to do all the hunting you want. DOCK: So what do we need that Glasscock fellow around? There's enough of us. WlLLlS: I'll tell you why-- 'cause he knows his grease... and every damn criminal between Canada and Mexico. While you two boys are back there drinking... him and Avis are off scouting marks. JESS: I think we should get in the booze business. Everybody knows all big money is in bootlegging now. WlLLlS: Yep, and where's all that money going to end up? -I don't know. -ln a bank,that's where. JOE: Willis thinks it ain't wrong 'cause banks is insured. [Laughter] JESS: You'd think we were doing them a favor. See, if nobody ever robbed a bank... then all them insurance companies would go broke... 'cause nobody would need 'em. WlLLlS: That's right. I take it you ain't working today,Jess. What's she read,Joe? JOE: 14.6 since the last time. WlLLlS: This getaway map's got to be perfect,Joe. We gotta be able to drive this with the headlamps off. When do we get out,Willis? Where's it end? When we're millionaires, that's when. DOCK: How much is a million dollars exactly? WlLLlS: A million, Hoss? A one... with that many zeros. JESS: You got more guns in the running,you got more crime. And it just ain't worth it. JOE: Are you done yet? JESS: I'm just giving this fellow my opinion... of this new Volstead prohibition business. JOE: You ain't less of a drunk now than when hooch was legal. JESS: That's exactly my point. That particular law ain't doing its job. JOE: Let's go,Jess. -Have you got a wife? -Mm-hmm. -You got kids? -Mm-hmm. JESS: All right. Here you go. If I get arrested, you've got to bail me out. -Mm-hmm. -All right. JESS: You have a good night. JOE: Never knew making money the easy way... would be so damn much trouble. DOCK: It's colder than a bull's balls. JOE: Colder than a day-old dumpling. [Laughs] JESS: Colder than Pa's ass at plowing time. [Laughter] [Snap] GLASSCOCK: This may encourage folks to write more often. WlLLlS: Well, boys, it's our lucky night. JESS: Oh,yeah? WlLLlS: Yeah. I was up on that pole thinking... and I decided we going to get that other bank,too. DOCK: Ah, hell,Willis. I'm tired already. GLASSCOCK: What are you talking about, both banks? WlLLlS: Yeah, both banks at the same time. It's so cold out here there won't even be a dog barking. Jess,you go with Glass. Dock,you come with me... and,Joe, you're soldiering the street. All right? DOCK: Two banks? WlLLlS: Yeah. What do you say? -OK. -All right. WlLLlS: Glass,what does your watch say? GLASSCOCK: Are you positive you can blow that safe? JOE: Sure, he can. DOCK: Why you got to be questioning everything? WlLLlS: When that 2:40 freight whistle blows... you light yourfuse and let's get the hell out of here... to someplace where it's a bit warmer. Well, let's go, boys. -Willis? -Yeah? DOCK: Do you know the money's in there? WlLLlS: It's a bank, ain't it? Uhh. What? DOCK: Stand back and let me show you the two-step method. [Drops crowbar] What the hell you talking about? DOCK: Step one. Step two. [Wind blowing] DOCK: That's an awful big shot you're pouring. WlLLlS: Yep. Like Ma always said... God hates a coward. [Distant train whistle blows] JOE: Whoa, mister. Whoa, now. You're going to have to go another way. MAN: There ain't no other way. Well,turn around,then. It ain't safe. I'm too tiredfor your nonsense. Get out of my way, boy. Get up there! [Neighing] MAN: Wrong way! Whoa! Get out of here! [Yelling] JESS: You are a real desperado,Joe. JOE: I told him it wasn't safe. [Dog barking] ALDRlCH: But you said he... He threatened to--What was it? Blow up your entire family with dynamite? MAN: That was just atfirst. I can't remember too much, but he was friendly. Kind of funny. You know,we sent out a posse and that airplane,too. ALDRlCH: Oh,yeah, I know... but, believe me, these fellas are long gone. Thank you. MAN: Thank you, Mr. Aldrich. I'll buy all of that gum. LOUlSE: Well, hello, stranger. WlLLlS: Hello, Lou. Matter of fact, I'll buy the whole damn cigar stand. One of my wells just come in. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Now, I was figuring... that big-headed boss of yours in there... I slip one of these hundreds in the till over there... sneak you out,we take a slow drive in the country. What do you say? Willis, I don't know. Two hundred. OFFlCER: Will Reed? MAlD: That's him. He's one of them. I'll be back in just a second, love. Ma'am, gentlemen, can I help you with something? OFFlCER: Come upstairs with us... and explain what we found in your room. WlLLlS: I don't see how that's any of your business... but come to think of it... it shouldn't be a problem. What'd they do? They just searched me, made me put this on. -Well, get it off. -Whatfor? MAN: That's them, all right. I know them voices anywhere. Had on that same red sweater. OFFlCER: Thank you very much, sir. -That's whatfor. -Take him on back down. JOE: Lying son of a bitch! I ain't never seen that old man in my life! OFFlCER: Tomorrow,you boys are going to be indicted... for robbing the Lyceum Motion Picture Theater. If you got a statement to make, I'll be down the hall. JOE: I got a statementfor you! That old man can't even see! WlLLlS: Settle down,Joe. JOE: We didn't rob no damn picture show. WlLLlS: Settle down! Yelling ain't going to do us no good. They got us. We got to figure out how to get out of here. JOE: But we weren't even 500 miles of here that night. They can't prove we robbed nothing. WlLLlS: Hell,they just did. Hey, don't you get it? This here's a shakedown. Congratulations on yourfirst one. JOE: They already got that 2,000 from our room. WlLLlS: Which is, I'm sure, three times the amount... that was stolen from the picture show. JOE: Willis. All the time I was growing up, you and Dock,you was... off in the penitentiary, God knows where else. I never knew it was like this. Lord help me, I never knew. WlLLlS: It is, little brother. It is. But don't you worry,though, 'cause we going to get more. Now I'm about to show you why we wear... our savings account. Jailer! Let me out of here! I got a confession! WOMAN: Sweet boy... Syncopate your mama... All night long. With a Dixieland shake... Play it down... Then do it again. Every time... I hear that tune... Enough said... 'Cause I'll be with you soon. That's just why... I've got the Milenberg joys. Take it, boy. JESS: Oh. I'm sorry. LOUlSE: So,you're not an oilman, are you? WlLLlS: What do you mean by that? LOUlSE: Well,you know, there's talk around the hotel... and all that money they found in your room. WlLLlS: All that money? Me and my brothers made that money gambling. LOUlSE: You're a gambler? WlLLlS: No. I am no such thing. I'm just making my money now playing high-stakes poker... so's I can be that oilman. [Jazz music playing] JESS: Hey, little darling. I have a question for you. WlLLlS: Now,what I am is a businessman... just like a lawyer or someone working in the stock market. I'm just making a living. Do youfollow me? -Yeah, OK. -Uh-huh. How about it? Hmm... [Jazz music playing] WOMAN: I thought you boys said you were oilmen. DOCK: Oh! Now,that's a lie! You hear about those two banks in Hondo,Texas? JESS: We did that. He robbed one, I robbed the other. We went in there, and I said let's get 'em both. Hell,yeah, and God damn you, Uncle Sam! -I am a veteran! -All right, come on. -I fought them single-handed. -My brother,the war hero. -Hell,yeah. -Never got out of camp-- JESS: Don't interrupt! I can outdrink, outride... and outrope any member of this congregation... and I'll lick any man that says different. And I will lick you if you say different. [Music continues] MAN: 26 to 3,220. Twenty to me. Ninety-four, ninety-five. Well, hell,yeah, there's a pattern. One--they've all been robbed... and two-- my company had to pay out. ALDRlCH: And now it's up to the federal government... to bail you out. Right? Square-door safes blown with precision. No rough stuff. Couple of men outside for security. And the few watchmen they've taken... say they're a bunch of "please and thank you" country boys. MAN: If I got that much money in two years... I'd say thank you,too. HaIf these banks are clipping the association... for a hell of a lot more than was stolen. Damn bankers think it's a license to steal... now that they're all insured. You ought to just double the premiums... on any bank that won't springfor a round safe. MAN: That's justfine. ln the meantime... what is my government gonna do about this bunch? We're after 'em... and when we catch 'em... we're gonna put 'em away. JESS: Are we there yet? JOE: Go back to sleep. You're next. So how'd we do anyway? WlLLlS: I don't know. We done better. We'll count it in the morning. JOE: All right. Get some sleep. WlLLlS: Night, boys. SLlM: Willis Newton. If it ain't my old partner. Seems you done all right after we parted company. Got yourseIf a top-notch crew and all. WlLLlS: No,the only crew I got's drillingfor oil. So how the hell are you? SLlM: Can't complain. Thought we might talk a little business. So where you working these days? SLlM: Chicago. Things are hopping there. The bigfix is in-- cops, politicians,judges. Hell,they even bought the World Series. Boy,you must be in heaven. SLlM: Put you boys onto some sweet business opportunities. We have a mutual friend--Murray. One of your laundry fellas. Well, I tell you, Slim... those days are pretty much overfor me... but I do appreciate the offer. Yeah. Well, if for any reason... things don't turn out how youfigured... look me up in Chicago. [Door closes] LOUlSE: There was some creep outside earlier... who wanted to talk to you. That's just some old guy I knew way back when. What are you doing sitting in the dark? Hey,what's the matter? What's wrong, baby? LOUlSE: Willis, do you trust me? WlLLlS: Whoa, now tell me what happened. Did he say something to upset you? LOUlSE: No. I went to the bank today... to put your business things in the deposit box. I didn't want to fold up the oil lease papers... but the box was too small so I opened it up... and,Willis,there was so much money in there. I know you haven't made any money in oil yet... and you can't be winning that kind of money gambling. And I've seen you sign in at these hotels... under all these different names-- Reed, Rogers. And I found something in your jacket... that said your name was Newton. Reed isn't your name, is it? WlLLlS: Why, Lou? LOUlSE: I don't even know your real name? WlLLlS: I don't see how that matters much. You know that's just a part of my business. LOUlSE: Am I just a part of your business? -I didn't say that. -What is your business? WlLLlS: You know what my business is. LOUlSE: I don't think I do. Anyway, I put all that money in a savings account. WlLLlS: You what? LOUlSE: It's too much money to just be put in a box. WlLLlS: No. No. No. You really shouldn't have done that, honey. LOUlSE: Why not? The deposit box is in my name. You put the car in my name. When it comes to money, you do what I tell you. If it's going to be in my name, I think I have a right. WlLLlS: I got that money from a bank robbery. Are you happy now? A savings account? Are you trying to get me thrown in the pen? They can track that stuff, Lou! You're a bank robber?! My God! I'm in love with you! A bank robber! And a big liar! Don't act like I'm the only one telling stories around here. What? What? Like Lewis' daddy being killed in the war. He's still kicking around and you're still married. You don't know anything about my life. No, I don't, and you weren't gonna tell me. I'm not stealingfrom anyone or almost getting myseIf killed. WlLLlS: Goddamn it, Lou. I was born into nothing... and nobody ever gave me nothing. It's real simple. You do what you gotta do and I do what I gotta do. But you're a bank robber. Yeah. I rob banks. That is what I do. And it's what I'm gonna keep doing... until I make enough money from my oil business. Louise... I love you. I want to be together all the time. When I think about us I am thinking aboutforever. Then why didn't you tell me? 'Cause I was afraid you'd leave me if youfound out. LOUlSE: I wouldn't have left you. See, no matter how much money you have... you've got nothing if you can't trust someone close to you. Yeah. I'll tell you what. This next trip we're going up to Toronto... and I want you to come with me. What? I'm in love with a man, and I don't even know his name. -You do,too. -No, I don't. Name's Mr. Newton... and you are my Mrs. Newton. [Whistle blows] [Whistle blows] The guns go down under here. Put 'em under a douche bag and Customs won't touch it. What about the nitroglycerin? Do you carry that,too? No. Do you ever get afraid? I mean,what if they get caught? That's not a lucky question. WOMAN: Ahem. JOE: Evening, ma'am. [Train bell ringing] JESS: [Singing] Mary had a little lamb. Daddy killed it dead. DOCK AND JESS: Now it goes to school with her... Between two chunks of bread. Do do do... WlLLlS: What? GLASSCOCK: Mosler is 11 inches thick. JESS: She's shabby, shot, and short,too... GLASSCOCK: When I started out, you could punch... through a vault door with a jimmy bar. Could they not sing? JESS: Lulu lou... DOCK: Cuckoo coo. GLASSCOCK: Gonna take a lot of explosive to blow that. WlLLlS: That's all right. We've got a hell of a lot of explosives. GLASSCOCK: Can I be brutally honest with you,Willis? WlLLlS: Shoot, Glass. [Jess gargles] GLASSCOCK: Never mind. [Explosion] JESS: Damn. DOCK: Son of a bitch looks 11 inches thick to me. [Coughs] WlLLlS: What the hell have we got here? JOE: How do you get that open? GLASSCOCK: You don't. A month ago, they didn't have a round safe. These are worthless. WlLLlS: Don't tell me... we come all the way to Canada for this. GLASSCOCK: You blink your eyes and everything changes. Registered goddamn bonds, controls on explosives... round-door safe, cannonball safe! [Ranting incoherently] Ohh! Oh, God,what did I do? [Laughing] Ooh, ooh. LOUlSE: I thought you said you didn't smoke. WlLLlS: I didn't say I didn't smoke. I said it was a waste of time, just like this trip to Canada. LOUlSE: What about our vacation? [Brakes squeak] Come on. Let's get off here. LOUlSE: I'm glad they're changing the safes on you. You said you were done with all that anyway. GLASSCOCK: It's right out there on the street? WlLLlS: It's the dumbest thing you ever seen. These Canucks take all the currency to one place. They count it up... then walk the shit right back out in the street. GLASSCOCK: What about guards? WlLLlS: No guards! Just two Canucks and a bag of money. DOCK: Stick a gun in theirface. WlLLlS: They drop the bags, and we'll snatch and run. JESS: Be just like stealing old Tobe Roberts' watermelons. WlLLlS: Uh-huh. Hey,there, Louise. Just talking to the boys about a little business. How are you, beautiful? GLASSCOCK: I never thought we'd be going back... to this broad daylight Dalton boys kind of thing. JESS: What's the matter? Your stomach bothering you? Ooh, ooh, ooh. WlLLlS: This is gonna be a lead-pipe cinch, boys. Everybody know what to do? DOCK: You grab the bag, and we'll protect you. JESS: Is this the spot? JOE: Yeah. WlLLlS: A little bit more,Joe. JOE: I thought it was right back there. WlLLlS: A little bit more. WlLLlS: We ain't gonna get that one bag. We're getting all them bags. Go to hell. That ain't the plan. Well,the plan just changed, goddamn it. DOCK: Shit. Here they all come. WlLLlS: Dock, get that one. Glass and Jess,them two... and I got this one coming right at us. Come on,you sons of bitches. You want to live forever? DOCK: Drop the bag, or I'll blow you straight to hell! Drop it! WlLLlS: Drop the bag and get your hands up! Let's go! JESS: Excuse me. Excuse me. Give me the bag. Give me the bag! OFFlCER: It's a holdup! JESS: Shit. WlLLlS: Drop it! I said drop it, goddamn it. [Gunshot, screaming] You stupid sons of bitches. God-- OFFlCER: Aah! WlLLlS: Aah! [People scream] WlLLlS: Don't move! MAN: Call the police! SECOND MAN: They've got guns. OFFlCER: Hold it right there. DOCK: What are you doing with that damn gun? DOCK: Shit! Goddamn it! God! JESS: Get off me, you ignorant Canuck bastard! Get off my leg! Get the hell out of here, you son of a bitch! Get out of here! Get off my leg! Goddamn it! Shit! MAN: They're robbing the bank! GLASSCOCK: Jesus. [Clang] MAN: Let him go! SECOND MAN: Get out of here! OFFlCER: Hold it right there! Drop the goddamn gun! WlLLlS: Let's go, let's go, let's go! Joe! -Come on! Come on! -Drive. WlLLlS: Get Dock on the way. WlLLlS: Let's go! JESS: Let's go, come on! Give me that! [Gunshots] WlLLlS: Get down,Jess! DOCK: While they were clubbing my ass... where the hell were you? GLASSCOCK: Oh, gosh. JOE: What the hell was that back there? You tried to kill us off. GLASSCOCK: What a fiasco. Everybody in Toronto saw us. DOCK: We sure didn't see you. Where the hell were you, you yellow bastard? You didn'tfire a shot. GLASSCOCK: Listen to me,you idiot. I'm not supposed to fire a shot. You're not supposed to fire a shot! We're supposed to be backup, Willis! JESS: You back up any further, you'd be in Chicago. GLASSCOCK: I am a professional. I stick to the plan. -What plan? -Everybody shut up! WlLLlS: It ain't over yet! You got it? We're gonna see you two back in the States. GLASSCOCK: Why didn't you call and tell 'em we were coming? There's some windows you haven't shot out yet. DOCK: Where the hell was he? LOUlSE: I thought you were dead. They made an announcement at the racetrack. Everybody's talking about it. WlLLlS: I'm fine. LOUlSE: They said one of the gang was dead. WlLLlS: Nobody was hurt. We got away. LOUlSE: We've got to get out of here. WlLLlS: I was so stupid today, Lou. I wanted it all. I almost got my brothers killed. I don't know... how in the hell we got out alive, Lou. [Organ music playing] GLASSCOCK: Hey, I know that gal. Went to Sunday school with her. Yeah, in Parsons. How much you think was in those bags? Whatever it is, it ain't worth it. "All four wounded bank employees have been treated." WlLLlS: Bunch of stupid, dick-headed Canucks. LOUlSE: "Six bandits got away with an estimated $200,000." Hell, maybe 80. Them Canucks are pencil-whipping the insurance companies,too. You tell me, Lou, who's the criminals here? "They are believed to be American citizens... "one of which is thought to be critically wounded. "Police are combing hospitals and doctors' offices... "hoping to find a trail of blood... "leading to the perpetrators of this shocking crime." WlLLlS: Wouldn't have been no shocking crime... if they'd just dropped them bags like a regular person. Lou,you've got a bag. Out of nowhere comes a gun. What do you do? Boom. Drop the bag. I pick it up, I'm gone. How hard is that? Hot damn. -Willis. -Mm-hmm. LOUlSE: You have to promise me this was the last bank robbery. WlLLlS: You're damn right it was the last bank robbery... 'cause from now on it's oil business and that's it. LOUlSE: Aah! You're crazy. Why don't you tell me about this oil well? This oil well? -It's out in West Texas. -Yeah? -I even got a name for it. -What is it? WlLLlS: I'll give you one guess. MAN: Them big outfits been using them high-dollar rotaries. WlLLlS: I don't care about none of that. I put everything I got into this here rig. Where's my oil? MAN: Hell, Mr. Wilson... they done stuck too many straws in this soda. There ain't no pressure left. WlLLlS: Let me see if I got this straight. I put your ass in charge. I've been paying you top dollar for over a year now. I show up today and you tell me I got a chickenshit rig... I'm getting outdrilled by the bigwigs... and you got nothing to show me but a goddamn dry hole? MAN: There was oil down there. They done got it all. Ain't a damn thing I can do about it. Let me just put it to you simple. Just like an old sow's belly. Six tits, seven pigs. Looks like you're number seven. DOCK: Well, so who do we go after? WlLLlS: Every one of them sons of bitches right there. MAN: Yeah, go ahead. That's Standard Oil over there. John D. Rockefeller from New York City. Right over there is GuIf Oil. Mr. Mellon. He's a Northerner,too. Go on and get him while you're at it. Big city boys with deep pockets. Hell,you ain't even gonna get enough oil out of that hole... to part your hair. [Dock laughs] WlLLlS: That goes for all of you! Every one of you lazy sons of bitches is fired! Come on,Joe. DOCK: Aw,Willis, I wish you'd have let me do that. WlLLlS: What you looking at, Betty Crocker peckerhead? Either one of you two know where Jess run off to? JOE: Got a good idea. Why? WlLLlS: Let's go get him. MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, friends and neighbors... it's Booger Red's Wild West Show. Yes, it's entertainment for the entire family... and education for the children. You'll see the star-spangled pig. -What's that? -First place. JESS: First place three times this week. WlLLlS: That's good, Big Snake. We got a real job for you. You ready to go? JESS: I got a job doing what I like. WlLLlS: What,this? This ain't real,Jess. It's a damn zoo. JESS: It is real. It is real fun. Ohh! JOE: We're broke,Jess. DOCK: Yeah. JESS: Well,what are we gonna do? DOCK: We're gonna rob something. JESS: All right. DOCK: That well was a duster. JESS: Oh,well,that explains it. So you run out of money, and you need me, huh,Willis? Look at the big oil man go! Get off me. What you doing with my bag? JESS: So you boys lost all your money. At least I know where mine went. WlLLlS: There's something I want to ask you boys. JESS: You never ask us anything,Willis. Why don't you just tell us what you decided? DOCK: Now settle down. JESS: All right. WlLLlS: All right. It's this. Banks are pretty much overfor us. GLASSCOCK: They've all gone to cannonball safes. There's hardly any victory bonds left. Mostfolks are putting money in the stock market. JOE: Or oil wells. [Laughs] DOCK: What are we gonna do? WlLLlS: I got something in Chicago. And, boys,this is the big one. Now, I still gotta check it out closer... but I got some fellas working on the inside. JOE: I don't know,Willis. -Hell, Chicago? -What's wrong with Chicago? -I don't know. -"Hell, Chicago"? WlLLlS: Since when you been gun-shy about traveling? JESS: I don't like the White Sox. WlLLlS: I'm talking about getting out of this game. JOE: We're out of the game. WlLLlS: I'm talking about a couple of million dollars. JESS: Now that's interesting. That's a lot of money. DOCK: That is a lot of money. WlLLlS: It's about our kids not growing up on dirt. JOE: We ain't gonna have kids, we get ourselves killed. JESS: Ain't nobody gonna get killed. JOE: So banks are overfor us. Are we getting desperate? That's when it gets dangerous. You know that,Willis. WlLLlS: This ain't gonna be no Toronto,Joe. I promise you that. DOCK: I only got one question. -What's that? -Do you know the money's there? Aw,Joe. DOCK: Joe. LOUlSE: I can't believe you lied to me again. WlLLlS: That's before I got swindled out of my oil. Besides, I said no more bank robberies. -This here's a train. -Oh, God! WlLLlS: I can't quit while we're busted. LOUlSE: You said you were finished with all of that. WlLLlS: I wanted to be. I lost almost everything we had trying to be legitimate. God don't want me to be legal. I've tried my whole life and I keep getting pulled back in. LOUlSE: But we still have more money than most people do. WlLLlS: We ain't most people. And I owe them boys something. LOUlSE: They're not the ones who want the money. You are. WlLLlS: I'm the one who's got to take care of everyone. LOUlSE: Forget everyone else and think about yourseIf! What is wrong with you? Do you think you're the only man who got a raw deal? WlLLlS: No. But I'm not gonna take it lyin' down. LOUlSE: You see? You're never gonna get out of this. You go get your million dollars, but you're gonna be alone... starting in about 10 seconds. WlLLlS: Lou, stop. Get out of the car. We're going to my mother's. Don't you bother us. -I want to stay with Willis. -See? See? [Lively music playing in background] MAN: What do you want? WlLLlS: Willie Rice. Friend of Murray's. MAN: Come on in. -Hey,Willie. -Murray. MURRAY: Glad you could make it. Any trouble finding the place? -None at all. -Good. Come on. MURRAY: Wait'll you hear about this setup. It is the sweetest deal I have ever stumbled over. [Lively music playing] I grew up with this bird. Bill Fahy's the name. Little punk kid out back in the stockyards. Puny little bastard. Saved his bacon more than once. Anyway, he goes legit and becomes a postal inspector. Then two months ago... they transfer him from D.C. back to his old neighborhood. He likes the girls, and he likes the ponies. With the girls, you pay them enough... they always finish in the money. With the ponies--he's in deep with some serious people. More than a postal inspector makes in a lifetime. Anyway, he comes to me, and he says-- WlLLlS: I get the picture. MURRAY: Let me introduce you. MURRAY: I want you to meet somebody. FAHY: Don't tell me your name. You're a friend of his or he wouldn't buy the first round. Chiselin' bastard. Nice girls, huh? SLlM: Hey. This is the man I was telling you about. He's gonna help us out. Details, details. WlLLlS: Hey, buddy, details is my middle name. I want to know everything about this mail train. I'll supply the guys,the gas, the guns, and the guts... and you boys can sit back and split even with everybody. Can you handle that? FAHY: Yeah, sure. WlLLlS: Yeah. The consignments come down every Thursday on the 57 train. The Milwaukee registers are the pay dirt. Last week, it was 63 bags... insuredfor3 million. MURRAY: And sometimes, the Federal Reserve... loads extra bags at the last minute. I'm gonna check all this out then do some plannin'. Afterwards, any laundry work needs doin' on the bond... or the new mint money, you take it atfive percent. MURRAY: Ten. WlLLlS: Seven and a haIf. MURRAY: Done. GLASSCOCK: It's gonna be dark out there tonight. So I think it's a good idea if we wear these light hats. So we can identify one another. JOE: How do we know we're not being set up? DOCK: Shit,Joe. JOE: We're from Texas... and these fellas must know plenty of thieves in Chicago. WlLLlS: Yep, and the thieves know them. GLASSCOCK: Chicago's run by the mob,Joe. lrish, ltalian,whatever. If someone makes a score here... they got to fork a big chunk of it over. WlLLlS: Bunch of country boys do the job and we're gone. They get no tax from the big boys. JOE: Mail train's a federal offense,Willis. DOCK: Breakin' the law's breakin' the law. JOE: We ain't talkin' no little robbery here. WlLLlS: No,we ain't talkin' no little robbery. When the heat's on,we got ourfriend on the inside... who's gonna be running the investigation. DOCK: I just got one question. WlLLlS: Hell,yeah,the money's there. Three million dollars worth. I just seen it through a little peephole downtown. Goddamn it,this is everything we've been working towards. If we do it right, it's the last one. It's too much money,Willis. How we gonna get away with that? It's like killin' someone. They ain't just gonna let it go. -We'll be in Mexico. -You ain't up for it,Joe? -I ain't sayin' that. -You want out? That ain't it, and you know it. I'm in. Just askin' are you sure. Psst. All right. Boys... we fixin' to make history. WlLLlS: Get up and off, boys. This here's my train. MAN: Scram, boys. The bulls! JESS: Thought we was the law. How about that? [Train whistle blows] GLASSCOCK: Ten-twenty. JESS: Get your hands up, or I'll blow your head off! Get your hands up! WlLLlS: Stop this train at the two-mile crossing. [Train whistle blows] WlLLlS: Mister, don't make me blow your guts out. Get your mitts on that throttle! What the hell's wrong with you? You been kicked in the head by a mule? MAN: Hold on! GLASSCOCK: It's going too far. Damn. WlLLlS: Goddamn it! Now lookit where we are! Now back it up to where I said in the first place. -It's gonna take a minute! -Better be a quick minute! JESS: Ain't this a hell of a way to make a livin'? JOE: Everybody in there, come on out! What in the hell is going on? JOE: Keep them hands up. We're robbing this train. MAN: I was wondering whether we had hit something. -Anybody in there? -No,just me. All them postal turkeys is up front. GLASSCOCK: I'm gonna go see what's goin' on up there. JOE: Get down off of there. We're going up to the crossing. GLASSCOCK: Where is everybody? SLlM: I don't know. Something ain't right. That big son of a bitch must have run off. GLASSCOCK: What the hell's goin' on with this train? God. Hey! Hey! Drop that goddamn gun! [Brakes screech loudly] WlLLlS: See that tree? That's the crossing. Can't even park, stupid rat bastard. -Comin' down with two! -Comin' up with one! Slowly. SLlM: Remember, they got guns in there. WlLLlS: Yeah,well, so do we. GLASSCOCK: I got 'em,Joe. -You got 'em? -It's all right. WlLLlS: Mail car 2105. Hey. All right, everybody, outside now! Let's go! MAN: Ham, don't shoot! We're out here,too! WlLLlS: Jackson, get that poison gas! All right,you silly bastards. You're about to wish to God you had come out. [People yelling] MAN: Mister, don't let him kill them in there. Ain't nobody ever died from a stink bomb. JOE: All right, drop them guns now. WlLLlS: Come on. Come on. Get over there. Hurry up. Let's go. Who's the head honcho here? [People coughing] JESS: All right, move it, all y'all. ln here. Come on now. WlLLlS: Now I'm only after the registered mail... and I want every damn sack of it,you understand me? MAN: Yes, sir. WlLLlS: Good. Let's go. WlLLlS: Talk to me. MAN: Milwaukee registers are all up here. St. Paul goes back this way, and... this section's going to Minneapolis. There it is. All right. Start helping me toss these out and get Milwaukee first. Every single bit of it, honcho. Let's go! -Yes, sir. -Comin' down! JESS: Where the hell have you been? GLASSCOCK: Aw,Jesus. Some Hoosier was trying to sneak off the other side. Had a shotgun. Goddamn it. I had to shoot the son of a bitch. Y'all got anybody over there on the other side? MAN: You got us all here, mister. JESS: Aw, hell. Joe,you got all of them. JOE: All right. GLASSCOCK: I got him. Hell, I shot him five times. No, no. He's clear down the line. All right, now every one of you sissy belles... is gonna pick up a bag and lug it over to them two cars. Grab two. Throw it down here. SLlM: Put 'em in that back seat of that car. Some of you put 'em in the back of this car. Some of you put 'em in the back of this car. JESS: Shit. SLlM: Hurry up. Oh, my God. You idiot! You shot Dock! GLASSCOCK: No! No, I didn't! That's a Hoosier,Jess! Sh-- [Jess panting] Oh,Jesus. JESS: You shot my brother. Goddamn it,Willis! Willis! Get over here! It's Dock! WlLLlS: Jackson? Yeah, go. MAN: I think we can take this guy. You might all could take me but two or three will die. Now get back to work. JESS: Easy, Dock. Dock, come on. WlLLlS: No. No. JESS: He's bleeding to death. WlLLlS: Goddamn it, Dock. Oh, shit. We got to get him to a doctor. You holding?! We're gonna get you out of here, Hoss. Damn it,you just hang in there. You hold on, Hoss. Come on, Dock. Come on now. Come on. MURRAY: Did you get it? Shit. JOE: Come on! Easy, come on, come on. Shh. Get that on him. Get the hell out of here! Now! MURRAY: Jesus, I don't think he's gonna make it. -Get us a doctor. -Out here? Chicago, maybe. WlLLlS: Then we bring him to Chicago. MURRAY: A doctor sees him, and he'll call the cops. SLlM: Let's keep our heads. This could blow the deal. Why don't we just split the money and cut our losses? WlLLlS: This job ain'tfinished till Dock is taken care of! -OK, bad idea. -Take it easy,fellas. WlLLlS: You know people. That's why you're in this deal. I don't give a goddamn how, but you dig somebody up. If you don't, I swear you're not gonna make it. MURRAY: Calm down. I know a guy-- Let's go, goddamn it! WlLLlS: Take Dock with Murray. We'll stash the money. Eight shares, eight different places. SLlM: I gotta trust you with our shares? WlLLlS: We're trusting you with our brother. SLlM: Damn. SLlM: Jesus, Murray. I don't like this. Somebody had to see us drag this bloody son of a bitch up here. How is it he's not dead, Doc? DOCTOR: Chest wound alone should have killed him. Went in between his heart and his lungs. Hmm. I'll be back tomorrow to work on the fractures in his arms. MURRAY: Keep your mouth shut and don't get seen. He wants to win a fiddling contest,that's his problem. SLlM: It'd be a good idea if we got out of here,too. [Door closes] DOCK: Kill me. Git. JOE: Hey. We ain't leavin' you, Dock. Now,when you wake up, I'll be sittin' right here. Don't pass nothin' till you get to Texas. Remember, no contactfor a year. He didn't have a hat on,Willis. God almighty. [Baby crying] Joe. -God! -Aah! OFFlCER: Visiting hours is over, pal. MAN: Fan him. OFFlCER: Yeah. He's just like the kid. It's got an anchor on it. -What's this about? -What are you doing up here? They told me I could buy some beer up here. MAN: Come a long way for a drink,Tex. You got a name, candy boy? Yeah, I got a name. Name's Will Reed. I'm an oilman, goddamn it, and I'm throwin' a party-- OFFlCER: Party's all over, pal. MAN: Got your buddies two hours ago. That was an awful big score you guys made last night. It's too bad haIf the world saw you guys coming up here. WlLLlS: I'm just a messenger boy in this game, all right? You seem like good old boys. We could work something out. OFFlCER: Is that so? WlLLlS: I ain't got none of that money. But I can get my hands on a nice chunk of it... if you're interested. SCHOEMAKER: They say the value of money is all relative. This,for instance, is only ten smackers. It's nothing compared to the millions you pinched... but... it can pack a pretty hefty wallop. Time's relative. You're what, 22, 23? You're gonna be 50 years old before you get out of prison... if I don't get some answers. Got plenty of time. Because... I need you, Lou. [Dock gasping in pain] SCHOEMAKER: Come on, man. You can tell me, can't ya? I know this hurts. DOCK: I hope I die first. NURSE: Chief Schoemaker, there's a message for you. They say it's urgent. SCHOEMAKER: Thanks. We'll talk later. MAN: Time's runnin' out, pal. Looks like you've been jobbed. WlLLlS: She'll be here. OFFlCER: She? WlLLlS: Yep. She's a business associate. She doesn't have any idea what this is about. She's just bringing the money. OFFlCER: Ain't a skirt in the world I'd trust with 20 Gs. I'd be worrying about it every time I let her down. Every time she caught me hanging a story on her. Women never really forgive youfor that stuff. MAN: We waited a haIf hour. She ain't gonna show. There she is. I've got the money. WlLLlS: Good. You saw the papers? LOUlSE: Yeah. WlLLlS: We're just business associates, Lou. -You don't know nothin'. -OK. WlLLlS: We're gettin' out of this, Lou. When the time is right, we're busting Joe and Dock out. All right? Hey, Lou... OFFlCER: This one's pretty. You just business associates? LOUlSE: Back off,flatfoot. MAN: It's all here. Let him go. OFFlCER: Yeah, get lost. Nice doing business with you, candy boy. SCHOEMAKER: Let's have it. You're in a lot of trouble. You're comin' with me. Take her down to the precinct house. OFFlCER: Yes, sir. WlLLlS: Goddamn it! Backstabbing Yankee bastards! MAN: Damn! OFFlCER: Couldn't you have counted it a little faster? SCHOEMAKER: So you're the smart one, right? I take a bird like you downtown... you get a lawyer, you post bail... I never see you again. No, my friend, I'm taking you up to Rockford... where my cousin's the sheriff. He's got a nice solitary box up on the thirdfloor. I think you'll like it. Unless, of course, you want to tell me where... that post office loot is hidden? WlLLlS: So you can go tell the feds about it? SCHOEMAKER: Most of it. WlLLlS: Sorry to disappoint, but I ain't talking... unless it's to the man in charge. And you ain't him. ALDRlCH: Yep, biggest one ever. Makes quite a splash, this kind of thing. Well, nobody got hurt but one of their own. But all them zeros... Yeah...public's gonna want to see blood on this one. What we got to do here is put our heads together... and try to figure out who the inside man was. I'm sorry, "inside"? They knew every consignment on that train. Somebody high up on the inside must have tipped them. And I'll bet you my paycheck... it was someone right in your department. Huh. Hmm. JESS AND DRlVER: [Singing] Alla en el rancho grande... Alla donde vivia... Hay una rancherita... Que alegre me decia... Que alegre me decia. JESS: Aqui est bien, amigo. Prate. DRlVER: OK. Aqui. WlLLlS: Thanks for coming, Lou. I would have come sooner, but they wouldn't let me. WlLLlS: I know. Schoemaker give you the long list of bad things... that are gonna happen to me if I don't tell what he wants? He said you could go in for life,Willis. Ahh...could, if I don't play my cards right. They said you were in solitary? Yeah. How can you bear it? Just sit there thinkin'. 'Bout you, mostly. Swear it's like you're there with me, Lou. I can look into your eyes... I hear your voice... I even smell your hair. I just think about being in the same room with you, Lou. Not talkin' or nothin'. Just knowing you're there. You have got quite a line, Mr. Newton. I suppose I do. Lou... you know all them things I used to tell you I wanted? All I want now is to be with you. FAHY: Mr. Aldrich, I hope this doesn't take too long. I told my wife I would try to make it home for dinner. ALDRlCH: No,won't take but a minute. ln fact, it's right in here. ALDRlCH: Go ahead,take a peek. FAHY: Son of a gun. ALDRlCH: That's strange, isn't it? A peephole looking into the sorting room. FAHY: Son of a gun. Anybody could have made this. ALDRlCH: Oh... anybody exactly your height? [Spits] MAN: Come on now! [Shouting] JESS: What did I tell ya? I ain't never been throwed. Perfect record. You owe me 50 Yankee dollars. HAMER: Hell of a ride, son. You win. JESS: That horse wasn't near as mean as you said. I come all the way from Mexico for that? Oh, not just that,Jess. I'm Frank Hamer,Texas Rangers. Folks up in Chicago would like to have a little word with you. [Laughs] JESS: Aw, hell. Sh-- JESS: Frank Hamer. Frank, how about you let me go, I let you keep that 50? [Chuckles] HAMER: I guess not. JESS: Uh-huh. You guess not. Howdy! [Kicks dirt] Shit. SCHOEMAKER: Take a good look. GLASSCOCK: That light's bugging me. SCHOEMAKER: Look familiar? -Yeah, I know 'em. -ldentify them. GLASSCOCK: Well, let's see... this is Rube Waddell. That's Tris Speaker, Rogers Hornsby. lsn't that Ty Cobb? SCHOEMAKER: Yeah,that's Ty Cobb. Unh! SCHOEMAKER: You know this bird? JESS: Oh,yeah? Looks like he was weaned on a pickle, don't it? [Laughs] SCHOEMAKER: Shut up. Do you know him? No, I don't, and I wouldn't care to, neither. You know,Jess,your brothers have spilled the whole deal. Well, great. You don't need me then, do you? Sit down! Look, Chief,you are doing a hell of a job on this case. I want to congratulate you on pulling us all in... but you can squeeze me and my brothers... from now until Judgment Day... and you ain't gonna get word number one outta us. Get outta here. SCHOEMAKER: We got you. We got your brothers. We got Murray. We got Slim. We even tracked down your old pal Glasscock... at a health spa in Battle Creek. Still can't help you, sir. I'm getting sick and tired... of you stupid closemouthed country-- ALDRlCH: Go easy on that stuff, Chief. SCHOEMAKER: You're either the smartest or the dumbest... son of a bitch I ever dealt with. ALDRlCH: We've tried it your way for three months... and haven'tfound a nickel. Let's try it mine. -Hey,Willis. K.P. Aldrich. -Howdy. ALDRlCH: Feel like I know you already. You met Chief Schoemaker. WlLLlS: Oh,yeah. ALDRlCH: Sit, sit. WlLLlS: So, uh,youfrom the federal government? ALDRlCH: That's right. WlLLlS: All right. Well, it's about time. -Uvalde, right? -Yep. -I'm from Austin myseIf. -Pretty country. That it is. Look,Willis, I'm gonna put it to you square. We got to figure some way out of this. WlLLlS: Yeah. Well, I figure since it's Joe's first offense-- Willis... I got a file as thick as your arm there... on jobs youfellas pulled all across the country. I been following you boys for a while now... and I gotta hand it to you,Willis... you sure as hell had yourseIf one hell of a gang. But I'm sure some people in the Justice Department... might be interested in digging up some old business. All right. If I deal, do we walk? No. Not right away. Not on this one. But I could be very,very influential... with the judge who's going to do the sentencing. WlLLlS: Gimme details. You and Dock will get 12. Should be out in four. Murray and Slim-- No,them two bastards got their own money. They can make their own deal. What about Joe? If Joe and Jess make a good impression in court-- No. Jess didn't have nothin' to do with this. He was off runnin' horses. Willis, got Jess when he came across the border... to ride a pony on a bet, so don't bullshit me, son. I'm being straight with you here. All right. How much? They could get off with a year or so. Butfor that, I need all the money back. And I need you to hand me that little weasel Bill Fahy. Hmm. You know us Newtons do a lot of things, Mr. Aldrich... but there are a few things we don't do. We don't kill nobody... we don't steal from women and children... and we don't rat. Somebody's got to,Willis... or we don't have a deal. LAWYER: May I approach the witness,Your Honor? JUDGE: You may. LAWYER: Could you identify for the jurors... the person in this courtroom... who actually... masterminded the robbery? GLASSCOCK: It's the gentleman sitting there in the brown suit. William Fahy. FAHY: He's a liar! I've never seen this guy in my life! I'm being railroaded! It's not me! It's them! It's Willis Newton! He planned the whole thing with his brothers! It's him! JUDGE: Order in the court. Sit down, Mr. Fahy... or I'll have you removed from this courtroom. The Newtons will be dealt with soon enough... but since this is your trial... I suggest you concern yourseIf with the business at hand. ALDRlCH: Willis. You think this is gonna work? WlLLlS: When it does, you're gonna be talking... to an ex-millionaire. [Chuckles] JUDGE: You understand the meaning of a guilty plea? JESS: Yes, sir,Your Honor. It means we're guilty. You caught us with a wetfinger in the sugar sack, sir. We're guilty, guilty, guilty... and awful sorry we put everybody through all this trouble. See,we're simple cowboys. We don't know much about guns and train-robbin'. Just sort of come along on a lark... if you know what I mean. Is it true you turned to the fireman and said... "Ain't this a hell of a way to make a living?"" [Laughter] I guess. You know, but a fella has to ask himseIf... what's right and what's wrong. What we did was wrong. I suppose we messed up that ol' train robbery... 'bout as much as any outfit could. Even managed to shoot our own brother. [Chuckling] Naw,Your Honor, I figure that the Newton boys... was never cut out for the wrong side of the law. -You may sit down, Mr. Newton. -Thank you,Your Honor. JUDGE: Counselor, approach the bench. WlLLlS: Hell of a performance,Jess. JESS: Folks seemed to appreciate it. WlLLlS: Yeah. Right. Tell you what, it's a good thing we still got that 35,000. Actually, we--we don't have that 35,000. You spent it? No, I didn't spend it, I buried it. I went out one night with this cab driver-- he was a great guy-- and we found a perfect spot, we covered it up. I come back a couple of days later, it's daylight... and the whole damn place looks exactly the same. All right? I can't tell one rock from another. What you're saying is you got drunk... and you lost that money. I probably had a couple, but that wasn't the thing. The trouble was this cab driver was on a serious drunk. He didn't even know what road we was on. He was no help at all. Goddamn it,Willis, I been lookingfor that money... every day until they come and drag my ass up here. JUDGE: Would the defendants please rise? WlLLlS: I guess you're right, brotherJess. Us Newtons ain't cut out for the wrong side of the law. REPORTERS: Here they come! OFFlCER: Back up! REPORTER: Dock! [Clapping and laughing] REPORTERS: Joe! -Willis! -Willis! REPORTER: Willis, any regrets? JOHNNY CARSON: My first guest is a gentleman... who was one of the Newton brothers. Would you welcome Joe Newton? Joe? [Applause] -How are you, sir? -Fine. CARSON: It's nice to meet you. I think people thought I was really joking... and this was a put-on or something. JOE: Nothin' put-on about this. CARSON: Nothing at all. This was in 1924. JOE: Nineteen twenty four. CARSON: That you robbed the train. What train was that? I wasn't around in 1924. JOE: It's right out of Roundout, lllinois... about 30 miles out of Chicago. The little station they call a roundout... that's where they got the name. It was a mail train going on west. CARSON: It says in four years you robbed eighty banks. JOE: We robbed a lot of them. [Laughter] WlLLlS: No,we didn't rob all the banks in Texas. We just robbed 30 or40... but we robbed plenty in other states like lllinois... Arkansas, Missouri... Kansas,Wisconsin... North and South Dakota, and several other states. We're just like doctors and lawyers and everybody else. It was our business to do that. We never killed anybody, and we never wanted to. All we wanted was the money--to make money. CARSON: You lived pretty well, I suppose. JOE: Oh,yeah. Yeah. We stayed in the best hotels, ate at the best cafe... and drove the best cars there was them days. CARSON: A lot of women? JOE: If you got a good car and a pocketful of money... and a young man,yeah. That'll answer your question. WlLLlS: Nobody never give me anything but hell in my life... and I never done anything I was ashamed of doing, either. I've done some things I'm sorry of. One thing I was sorry of was we robbed a bank up in Kansas. Old boy inside got scared and run off and left $200,000. All they had to do was put it in a handbag. When I bawled him out about it, he says, ""Oh,we got enough." I says, "We never get enough." When I go in to get anything, I want to get it all. From then on, I went inside... and they was cleaned out when I come out. CARSON: When did they catch you, now? JOE: Right after that. One of our men-- it wasn't one of us, it was one of the men with us-- he got excited-- It had to be excitement. He went on the other side where he wasn't supposed to be... and shot one of my brothers. -Killed him? -No, no. JOE: He shot him five or six times with a .45. He should have killed him. [Laughter] CARSON: A .45 is a big-bore weapon. That should have pretty well-- Your brother recoveredfrom that? JOE: He recovered, lived to be 83 years old. WlLLlS: My mother was over in Cottonwood one day... and she met my schoolteacher... and I'd quit, and she asked her why. My mother said, "His clothes got so bad, he's ashamed to go." But she said, "He's the smartest pupil I ever had in my school... "and if you give him an education... "there's no telling what he'll make out of hisseIf. "And if you don't give him an education... "there's no telling what he'll do." CARSON: How old were you when you started this? JOE: Nineteen years old. When was the first time you went to jail? JOE: Uh,that Roundout train robbery. CARSON: Yeah. I thought you were going to put that on and stick me up. [Laughter] JOE: You thought I was gonna... CARSON: I thought you--Yes. JOE: You thought I was reachingfor my pistol? CARSON: I thought you were putting your mask on and... Old habits die hard, don't they,Joe? Let me ask you something. If you had to do it over again, you wouldn't recommend this. JOE: No. We was crazy for doing it. But you're young then. Somebody said, "Why didn't you invest that money?" I said, "Who wants a better job than what we already got?" That's what we thought then. I need money, go out and rob another bank. CARSON: But you wouldn't recommend that? JOE: I wouldn't recommend that. We was crazy for doing it. WlLLlS: When I first begin to think of robbing banks... I never thought of hurting anybody. And I knowed all them bankers was rich... and they didn't care about hurtin' us poorfarmers. So why should I care about hurting them? Why shouldn't I steal from 'em? It's just one thief a-stealin' from another.
