There's room in the car. Certainly, why not? Great! Very well then. Excuse me... We're taking the bus all the way up? Don't worry. We'll leave it up there, then it's not far. We've been doing this for years. Don't worry. OK. Oh, man... What the fuck?! - Move already! - Cool it, man. Fuck you, I'm cool! Fine. Just drive. - Move the sheep already! - Wait, don't run them down. They'll move away. Will you move?! Don't accelerate. Motherfucker... Excuse me, man. - How much to the top? - We're going to get there. You're not alone. Dear all, here are the guns. Don't fuck around with them, they're no toys. If I catch anyone... shooting at birds, dogs or cats, they'll have to deal with me. This is the way to carry a gun, with the barrel pointing down. Is that understood? If perhaps someone... has never used this type of a gun, let me know, and I'll explain it to them. What's up? No fucking license... But the lady here vouches... What the fuck have you done? - Nothing, the agency sent them. - Go fuck yourself. - Give him a gun. - No, you give it to him. Tell him to grip it tightly. You'll get your bullets, you won't shoot without them. You should always go outdoors. Nature is... how shall I put it, a stream of blood in our veins. Yes, fine, darling. OK, I won't speak then. What happened? Wait, let me see. It's nothing. Next time wear longer pants. Like mine. Here... It's so beautiful here. Calm. Wilderness. Untouched by men. We said, on my command! What are you doing? - There was a rabbit. So what? - A rabbit? We paid for this! - What did we say back there?! - Stipe, let him be... - You oaf. - Let him be, Stipe. Did it startle you? The heart... Let me do it. I won't go hunting today. It doesn't matter. We can just take a walk. No, I'd rather stay here. You have to move around. I don't feel like it. Shit! What the fuck?! You' re stupid, or what?! They'll call the agency to complain. Please, man... Lady? Would you like to try? We could go elsewhere if this lot bothers you. You and I... Ivica, come here a second. Ask her if she'd like to go alone with me so I can show her real hunting. Go alone with you? You're nuts, you could get us in trouble. Forget it. Ask her, that's my problem. Please, don't. They'll sue you, you know how they are. She won't come, huh? Is she afraid, what? Fuck, she just doesn't want to. I told you. Come... Come, let's go. - I moved and my eyes are closed. - Not at all, look. Please, take another one. - Don't move. - Wait... Look! Look! There... a rabbit! Look at it running. Go on... Watch me then. OK? Watch me. Your feet... You hold it like this... Watch. The powder stinks, huh? Try it? You're a bit strange girl, aren't you? Alright then. Let's go there then. Would you? Alright. Here... Wait... Here... Here... Take it. Hang on, hang on. Place your hand here. That's it. Lower... Firmly... that's it. Step forward. Come on. A bit more. That's it. Straighten up. That's it. It's fine. He's an asshole. Hello. Yes? What? Let me be, my sheep will run away! Again! It's there! Go on! You shot a rabbit! Don't be afraid of it. It's dead. This is... It's an old rabbit. He'd have died soon anyway. I know it's stupid to kill a rabbit like this... That's how it goes. Cut the crap. You've got something... It's just a small fly. Motherfucker! What have we done to you? You could have killed us! No one who shot at me lived. But I'll let it fly. Fuck, what can you do? Want me to kick your ass? You fucking cunt. You think this is all yours and you can do what you like? You fucking cunt. Stipe, what happened? Nothing, why? Where's his wife? We're waiting here, they're complaining that there's no game here... His wife ran away. - Don't bring his kind any more. - Ran away? Yes! He shot three feet from me. You gave him a gun, you jerk! Let's help him find her. He'll screw something up. Help him?! The motherfucker! Good day. What did you hear? - Some noise. - Don't mess with that. He asked. I can reply, can't I? What are we waiting for? Excuse me? I have an appointment. Please, have some patience. It's not my problem if you can't agree. This is not a way you do business. - This has been poorly organized - Yes, and they're impolite. Calm down. - What? I never get nervous. - Calm down. Come... Are you OK? Let's go. - I'm very tired. - We're waiting for those two. Fine. I'll take my medicine and wait in the bus. Calm down, calm down. I'll talk to them. It's not a problem. - I'll wait. - Didier, I'll handle it. Then do it. - I'm sorry. - Don't get upset. I'll talk to them. Here, take them home. - Wait, Stipe, what about you? - I'll go find them. - They can be anywhere! - I've never left anyone... and I won't start now! Stipe! Don't, we'll call the police! Take them the fuck out of here! Why are you doing this? Let the police handle that. - I pay my debts. - Stipe, please... Didier, come. We're leaving. We have to go to a hospital! She shouldn't have walked to avoid the venom getting into her blood. There's a road down there, we must hurry! Want me to help you or not? I want to help you, you idiot! Look, you motherfucker! Give me that gun! Call someone! Call for help! No, let go! Let go... You can't leave me here! Motherfuckers... Oh, fuck! Hello? Hello, Emergency? Hello? Hello?
