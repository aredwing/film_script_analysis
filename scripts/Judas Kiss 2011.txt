Two glasses of wine, please. Uh, vodka gimlet, rocks. Hey, I'm Zach. Nate. You're, uh... Topher's friend. Yeah. He, um... he showed me your audition tape for Blood and Barcelona. - You look good. - Did he say something? Well, I mean... I mean, you've got a good look. Too bad he didn't hire you as casting director. I witnessed your crash and burn with beautiful young Nate. Yeah, I, uh... aimed too high. Too high? Mmm, on the hotness scale. You know, I am a solid seven, and, uh, you can always get somebody two points below you to bump hot dogs, which for me is, like, a five, you know, guaranteed. But what I want is an eight or a nine, you know. Tens totally intimidate me. You know, I start to blather. He was, I don't know, maybe a nine, although with the lighting, I might have overestimated. I thought you could approach a nine. Seriously, no. So being my friend didn't help? Not so much. It can help you with one thing. Oh, yeah? What's that? Getting an excellent birthday present. You didn't... Thanks, Toph. It's got all my numbers and emails pre-programmed so you can reach me anywhere. Like if you were suddenly struck with an idea for a movie. Right, yeah. This will shrivel up your dick. Happy birthday, part two. Keystone? For the film festival. You want to take me to the keystone film festival? I need you to take my place. Your place? Dude, Blood and Barcelona just got financed. We leave for Spain right away. I need you to fill in for me as a judge at the festival. Dude, Keystone asked for you. There's no place for me there. Would they-would they even know that I'd be replacing you? Of course. All you have to do is watch some movies and interview film students for the festival scholarship. You love movies. And I'm sure the boys are cute. These aren't just boys, Toph. These are skinny-jeans-wearing brats who think that the world owes them something. Yeah. Ha, ha. Man, what would I even tell those kids? You know, my Hollywood career has consisted of parties and rehab. I think those kids would like to learn something from a guy who won the festival when he was only a sophomore. Yeah, that guy quit school to go to L.A. because he was so talented, and Hollywood obliged by making me the biggest partier ever. That was a different guy... Go back to Keystone. Birthday present, part three. I see you walk Around your room... Excuse me, uh... Mr. Welds? Welcome to Keystone University. We're the key to your future. Um, you must be here for the festival. You staying on campus tonight, son? Uh, Grace Hall. That's a student dorm, son. You must've pissed someone off. Most VIPs are staying in The Tower. At least it's easy to find. Thank you.

It only takes one look To start shakin' your head It only takes one crook To start sleepin' With a bat in your bed It only takes one brick Just to build up those walls And it only takes one hit To make them all fall I want to break your stereo I want to break Your stereotype I want to break your stereo I want to break Your stereotype If you could break my stereo I want you to break My stereotype Oh, you could break my stereo I want you to break My stereotype, yeah Now do you wanna see my little hammer It's stuck in my chest Do you wanna see my little hammer It's probably for the best We all have statues That we build up In our minds My little hammer wants to Break that stereotype I want to break your stereo I want to break Your stereotype I want to break your stereo I want to break Your stereotype If you could break my stereo I want you to break My stereotype If you could break my stereo I want you to break My stereotype Come on Shit! Ah, shit. Mrs... Blossom? Mr. Wells. Punctual as always. You look exactly the same. Your charm with the ladies is unflagging. Ahem. Oh, I'm sorry. We were just socializing. Thank you so much, Mr. Lyons, Mrs. Lyons. We are the honored beneficiaries of your unending generosity. That was Mr. and Mrs. - Yeah, I know. Of course, you did. Your schedule. Be prompt. Files on each of the scholarship finalists you'll be interviewing. Read them. Each of the finalists' tapes. Watch them. I get it, I get it. Thank you. Good day, then. Mrs. Blossom. Mr. Wells? Listen, I know I was sort of imposed on you here. Mr. Shadoe is quite an advocate for you. Mrs. Blossom, please. I'm trying to apologize. - For what, Mr. Wells? - For Topher. For screwing up your film festival. Topher Shadoe is a horrendous name. Why you boys choose to change your names is beyond me. Names, faces, films. I don't forget the good ones, even yours. You've got a schedule to keep. Yeah, right, um, okay. Okay, last question, Tommy. Tell us what makes your creative vision unique. I like to stare through windows and just watch people. Mr. Wells, please. Oh, call me Zach. I'm pretty sure smoking's not allowed. Stow it, Ralph. I need a poo break. So, Tommy, back to you. No pressure. So, yeah, I like to see what people are gonna do when they think no one is watching. Sometimes I'll peek through the crack of my sister's bedroom door... and watch her sleep. I also like to walk around with my hands like this. Like how mysterious you look surrounded by all that smoke, Zach. I wonder what you're looking at... what you're you thinking. Sometimes I spend my whole day framing people up. My whole life is cinematic. I even masturbate cinematically. Wow, you've got an exciting career ahead of you. Really? Oh, yeah, you're gonna make a killing in porn. - Mr. Wells! - I'm just saying. And scene. Thank you, Tommy. And now I really have to insist on that poo break. Thank you, Mr. Garlington, Ms. Lynn... Zach. Come on, Ralph. You look like you need to take a shit. I'm your 3:30. Well, this is awkward. Uh, nothing personal, but it looks like I have to care about who you are now. Look, you and I have never met. Got that? Never met. If you mean we've never been properly introduced, then sure. Never met. My name is Danny. - Danny Reyes. - What? So sorry to keep you waiting, Danny. - Human needs, you know. - Of course. I trust Zach was good company? Oh, he certainly was, Ms. Lynn. Uh, how come I didn't see this kid's file? Did you take my copy to the bathroom with you? What? I washed my hands. Okay, fine, look. Danny, let's get started, shall we? Why don't you tell us what inspired this wonderful film. Wait a minute. You're Danny Reyes. Yeah. Where did you grow up? I went to Lockton High School. Lockton? Zach, are you all right? What's the name of his film in this competition? Judas Kiss. Indeed. Danny, why don't you tell us what inspired you to tackle this controversial subject in the short form? Your father. No, my... My film is fictional. Some... Somebody put you up to this. Mrs. Blossom? Topher? Look, Mr. Wells, if this is about last night... Last night? You can't be Danny Reyes. I am Danny Reyes. For quite a few reasons, that's impossible. - Zach. - Mr. Wells! Where are you going? To find Mrs. Blossom. This is totally fucked up! I think I need another poo. Stop! What is going on here? That can't be Danny Reyes. Of course it is. He was on our schedule. He wasn't on mine. What is up with you and this kid? We have to interview him, Zach. Just gimme a minute, okay? Listen, I'll go reschedule with Mrs. Blossom, and then we'll go to coffee, okay? Just wait for me here, okay? Call Topher. Calling Topher. Topher, this better not be one of your little practical jokes. There's a kid here claiming to be Danny Reyes. Danny Reyes, from Lockton. Ring any bells? Oh, and I slept with him. Did you plan that too, you goddamn pimp? I'll call you back. You're... Welds, right? You gave me directions. That's why I'm here. Gimme a cigarette. We need to talk. The sweaty taste Upon your lips My hands are moving Towards your hips About to show me Where this feeling Will take us This night will make us Am I too common For your love Too mainstream Not quite strong enough Maybe I'm too naive or Tell me Do you like it rough? And, cut! That'll be all for today. Great job, everybody. I have an interview. All right, that is a wrap for the day. Everybody, please check the board for your next call times. I'm never having sex again. Are you still hung up on cute older dude from last night? You don't understand, okay? I am so completely, totally, all-encompassingly fucked. You need to chill. And there's no such word as "encompassingly. " Yeah, well, a new word is required for how much I just fucked my life. Spill. I slept with one of the judges. At the interview? No! Cute older dude, he... Turned out to be one of the judges. Wow. You have the weirdest mojo ever. I hope I'm not interrupting. No, no, you're right on time. Okay, drama queen, focus. Let's get this interview done, and then we'll sort out your issues. Right. Right, sorry, Abs. Focus. Hi, I'm Abbey Park. Chris Wachowsky. We've got your chair set up right over here. Who's your partner? Slave driver, you mean. Uh, that's Danny- Danny Reyes. You made Judas Kiss. Yeah, that's me. No one's ever gotten their freshman film into finals before. Lucky, I guess. Is there any chance that I could get a look at it before the screening this weekend? Really? You'd, uh... You'd want to see it? The entire film school is insanely jealous of you. We were all jealous of you when you won the film festival last year. Hello? Remember? Interview? I'm all set up here. Okay. Chris Wachowsky, winner of last year's Keystone Film Festival, how has life changed since winning? You gotta make things right with the kid. He's who he says he is. I'm sorry, sir, but you can't possibly know that. He's Danny Reyes. - He can't be. - He is. I'm Danny Reyes! You're Zachary Wells. Danny Reyes went to school here 15 years ago. That was me. What happened to him? I... He's gone. Just like that? You think changing your name added I.Q. Points? How many times you've done rehab now? You're getting a second chance, "Zachary. " Okay, we're done here. This is the key to your future. Change his past... Change your future. I'll see you around. You know, most people have a follow-up question when I say I plan on bringing bloody films back into fashion. Right. So, what, are you gonna go down to L.A. and do the whole starving artist thing for a while? Lame! No one tries to become a starving artist, rasshol. How about asking a non-bullshit question? Abbey you can't say... - Feent, bleep me out. Whatev... - Abbey... Ask him a real fucking question, you muss. Feent. Are you afraid of the future? Wow... That is a real fucking question. Am I afraid of the future? Yeah. Terrified. I mean, it's the future. Who wouldn't be? But it's a fair fight. I know I have what it takes to win. Okay, uh, I think we got what we need here. Abbey, could you, uh, take down that boom? Slave driver? Hey, what's up? What the hell are you doing in my studio? No harm done. Danny, this is Shane. Shane Lyons. Oh... Hi. I didn't realize you were still here. I'm meeting my parents for coffee. The film festival is their big hoohah for the year, so I'm at their beck and call all week. Who are your friends, C.W.? Uh, Danny Reyes. This is Abbey... Park. Danny Reyes and Abbey... Park. Huh. Danny Reyes, you have a film at the film festival, right? This is where my family's insane film festival party will be tomorrow night... And you're coming. If I'm forced to endure my parents' stay on campus all week, I'm entitled to bring extra guests. Yeah, party. Awesome, great. Yeah, and, uh, bring little missy with you. C.W., you're invited too, of course. Sure... Thanks. How did you get in here? Don't you think we need to talk? Feent. I blew the R.A. once. He owed me for not telling his girlfriend. Keystone University, where blowjobs are the key to my dorm room. Funny. I just want to talk to you about that whole interview thing. You see, I really need this scholarship. Why you more than anyone else? My film. Let's just say putting it in the festival is going to put me into a little bit of a financial bind. It cost a lot to make? You could put it that way. Gonna get that? Right. Hello. Hey, it's me. Rebecca. You're taking me to a cocktail party tonight. Do you ever just ask for anything? If I don't command you, you'll just stay all day in that pathetic dorm room smoking Art Deco cigarettes. I'm supposed to avoid drinking. Okay, I'll be straight with you. You're my excuse for blowing off Ralph Garlington. Fine. Great. Pick me up in an hour. You know, you can't smoke in here. You gonna tell on me? So, Danny... Daniel Reyes Jr.? Grew up in Lockton? Uh-huh. Your dad, he teaches at the high school? Yeah. And your mom? What about her? She died. Cancer, right? What? You trying to freak me out? No, I'm just trying to figure out how much of you is phony. Well, I'm about as real as you are. Well, that's not really saying much. Hey! You're Danny Reyes. Yeah. So did I pass your little test? Are we gonna be okay for this interview tomorrow? You do your part, and I'll do mine. Table! Not today, supermodel. Wow. Hollywood's made you cutthroat. Film school made me cutthroat. Hollywood just helped me dress better. So, Danny's interview, tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. You've seen his shorts, right? Shorts? Short films, pervert. How are we supposed to argue about it if you haven't even seen it? We have to argue? We certainly do. Unless you plan to work out this sexual tension some other way. Tension? You're bristling with sexual tension, Zachary Wells. Admit it: you're hot for me. I... I know, I know. Your life's so complicated. Whatever. Go watch the kid's damn film already. Go. Mrs. Blossom. Hey, Mrs. Blossom! Wait up! Look, I'm really sorry about that whole interview thing, but you've really got to help me understand what's going on here. Understand? You know that kid can't be Danny Reyes. You know he didn't make Judas Kiss. I made that film 15 years ago. Danny Reyes made that film. I'm Danny Reyes. You're Zachary Wells. Danny Reyes is still here. Please tell me I am not going crazy. You're not going crazy. Wait! You want more? Some answers. Danny Reyes always wants more. His cocksure attitude, his charm, his talent - they always get him what he wants. Stop giving him what he wants, Mr. Wells. Give him what he needs. I don't know what that means. You were brought to Keystone to do a job. It's the key to your future. Why does everybody keep saying that? - Everybody? - You, and that tour guide. That old man... Stay away from him. He has his own work to do. Do your job, Mr. Wells. Interview the students, judge the films, make a difference. Good day. Fet. Hey, rasshol! What happened to "Meet Me After Sundown"? Abbey, I'm sorry. Don't go all Canadian on me. What? Like you look like you're in my reality, but actually you're in a parallel dimension... Like Canada. Your ass, up here. You brought your camera? Yeah. Thought I'd get some practice shots. So, how'd it go with cute older dude? Fine... Weird. I- I don't know. Is this multiple choice? Okay, he said we'd be fine for the interview tomorrow, but it's-it's like... Like what? Like he knows me, Abs. Like he knows what we've done. He can't possibly know. Get down here. You're just letting guilt get to you. No one could know. Now, look at the pavilion. That is Emerald City, and you and I are Dorothy and her friend. Somehow your pretty-boy looks have gotten us invited to the festival's hottest party, so we are having fun tonight. Understood? Yes. Understood? Yes, Dorothy. Now, come along, my friend. Bitch. Welcome, weary travelers. For you... And little missy. I have a surprise for you. So you can relax and we can have fun later. Hey, Chris. Hey. Nice camera. Old school. Bolex 551 XL. You know your cameras. Is this the model with 36 F.P.S. and Aspheron wide-angle lens? Yeah. Everyone is talking about your film. Yeah, well, that's not always a good thing. Meaning? I just totally fucked up my scholarship interview. Well, maybe I can put in a good word for you. C.W., making time with our budding filmmaker? Daniel, little Miss Abbey sorely misses your company, and she commanded I come fetch you, so come on. Yeah, sure. I am so screwed, Shane. Screwed, screwed, super-screwed. Don't jump to conclusions. You just got under this guy's skin. Well, that's not the only thing I got under. I've seen Judas Kiss. How'd you manage that? It blew me away. It's gonna blow everyone away, no matter what that guy says. I can see to that. That's... awesome. Shane, your mom cut herself with the cheese knife thingy. Godver. C.W., do me a favor... Take him home, will you? He's a little, uh, wasted. You gonna be okay? Home in one piece, C.W. Sure. He's mine. Hey. Hey, camera dude! Thanks. I wish I was inside your head. All right, let's get you back to your dorm. Wait. Abbey. We, uh, need to get Abbey. We'll get her on the way out. Excellent. Okay, let's get you to bed. Okay. Alone. Bitch. Good morning, son. How'd you get in here? Your R.A. seemed real eager to let me surprise you. So guess what I got in the mail? I have no idea, Dad. Two things: your tuition bill... and this. My invitation. Dad, can we, uh, talk about this later? I have a scholarship interview to get to. We talked about this months ago, Danny. I pay for film school, and you are not to show that film. Dad, it's fiction. It's worse than fiction. It's a lie. Look, Dad, I have a real chance at winning this. Not at my expense, you don't. Not at your mother's. Don't bring her into this. Withdraw the film, son, or your little movie career is over. Dad, please. Aw, jeez. Take a shower. You stink. Gimme a cigarette. I am not supposed to talk to you. So, don't talk. Did that old windbag tell you to stay away from me? Why would she tell me that? Because you have a decision to make. Don't let him win. Danny? Do you care about anyone else? See, I won 15 years ago. Judas Kiss won. You cheated. I did not. What's the date on that? First draft. Senior year, high school. So what? Playing dumb doesn't really do it for you. Official rules say, "Original screenplay written while attending Keystone. " Who are you, huh? Why do you care so much about my past? His past is the key to your future. What on this campus isn't the key to my future? That script proves Danny cheated with Abbey's help. That's how you keep him from winning. Winning was the worst thing that ever happened to you. I can't just walk into Blossom's office with this. How would she know it's real? You don't have to. Now I gotta win. He's going cut me off if I keep Judas in the festival. Your dad's really that much of a Rasshol? Trust me. That's him on a good day. Most people walk facing the direction they're headed, C.W. Hey. You gonna go to Martinez' party tonight? Yeah, sure. Great. Then we'll meet you there. And remember- eyes forward. Come on. Only you and I know about the script. Look, I can't concentrate on this right now, okay? I'm serious. Get him out of your head. You know, you're right... I gotta get psyched about this interview. I love you, Abs. Oh! Okay. Too much love in the room. Wish me luck, huh? Luck, really. Zach, you ready for this? Uh, yeah. Ready. Is it all right if I come in? Perfectly fine, Danny. I'll start where we left off. Your film, Judas Kiss, tackles some pretty intense issues. Why such a controversial subject in the short form? Well, sir, I kind of wanted Judas Kiss to be more of a... great knockout punch rather than an entire boxing match. That is a wonderful metaphor, Danny. Thank you, sir. Winning this competition could open a lot of doors for you, Danny. What do you plan to do with those opportunities? Get rich. So, um, where do you see yourself, say, in 15 years from now? Famous, I hope. I'd work for it, obviously. Few more shorts before I graduate, then my first feature. Actually, I have an idea for it right now. It's about love in a parallel universe where everyone's turned around. Turned around? Yeah, like an all-gay universe where straight people are the minority. Gay, right. Of course. Is that a problem? No, no. Not for me, it isn't. So, in 15 years... Beach house in L.A., penthouse in New York, maybe one or two movies a year. Fly to places like Italy or Spain. What's so funny? Nothing. Spain is- Spain's awesome, man. So... What happens when everything doesn't go according to your plan? Well, I can work it. Judas Kiss proves what I can do. Yeah, but there's lots of great films in this festival. What if it doesn't win? Or what if you hit massive writer's block one day? Excuse me? What if you don't become rich? No fancy houses. You're just a part-time waiter who shoots wedding videos on the weekends for some millionaire's spoiled daughter? Are you supposed to be asking me questions like this? You shouldn't be afraid of questions, Danny. I'm not afraid. All I'm asking is, what happens when you don't get what you want? Look, I'm just focusing on my goals right now. It sounds to me like you're focusing more on the rewards. What if you don't have what it takes? Okay, great. Ralph, your turn. Um, Danny, let's talk about the lighting schemes you chose and how you used light to heighten the dramatic tension between the father and the son. Whaddya say, boys? Lunch? Uh, you two go ahead. I'll catch up after my cigarette. All right, see you at the cafeteria. Mr. Wells. Call me Zach. We've had sex, for Christ's sake. So that's what that was all about. All what? That interrogation. Well, you survived it, didn't you? So what do you want now? Do you think I'm gonna fail? You have everything you need to get ahead... Smarts, charm, looks. Everything, huh? You know, I can't stop thinking about you. I feel like you really see me. Why can't you just rely on talent, on hard work? Look, I'm not stupid. I know it's all about who you know. You think you're always gonna be able to get ahead by breaking the rules, use blowjobs and blackmail? What happens when you run into a player who's just using you? Do you sell him your dreams? We still talking about me? Who are you anyway? You know, nobody here knows you. So who'd you sleep with to get this gig? I'm just the guy... who can torpedo your shot at stardom. No. See, I'm gonna count on the audience for Judas Kiss tomorrow night, and the other two votes on that panel. The kid cheated. I know. Make things right. Where's my dad staying? College Inn. Hey. Hey. You got my note. Here, come with me. Why all stealth mode? I thought we kinda made a connection the other night. Me too. Shane really likes you. Is that why we're doing this out here in the middle of the forest? Shane is like the Emperor of Keystone. Look, Shane is amazing and hot. But you... You know about Aspheron lenses. And 36 F.P.S. I'm just saying that we should be careful. Shane... I promised I'd go to dinner with him tonight. Don't piss off Shane. You're really scared of Shane, aren't you? Okay. You going to the party at Martinez' later tonight? You? Uh-huh. Okay. Go, go... You're killin' me. I'll find you. I am so dead. Dude, we're in public. Why should we care about them? Doesn't it bother you that you terrify people? Do I terrify you? Look, I'm serious. What's that all about? I don't live afraid... Of them... Of anyone. A thousand urgent voices Shout their own refrain But you are the whisper That will light... Feels really nice. What's got your shoulders so tense? The festival? You know, Judas Kiss can't help but win something. It's not just that. It's my dad. If I don't win this festival, I'm out on my ass. I thought you totally charmed up that judge. Yeah, well, I'm not sure how well I did that. Maybe you could use a tutorial. Make him see how big a difference he could make in a young filmmaker's life. So incomplete And as I'm raking through The embers of this game A thousand urgent voices Shout their own refrain But you are the whisper That will light This phoenix flame Your love will let me Breathe again Hey. Move in with me next semester. No matter what happens with your dad, with... with the film festival, we'd be set. Say yes. Y- yes... Of course. Okay. You should get a move on. This is your big day. Foolishly We all run blind Across the earth So I sit here Contemplating What it is I've done Where I will be going I am not the one Not the one We're all looking For immediate salvation Unconditional love At a price we can't afford We need to talk. Jeez, ambush much? Feent. But one at a time. You first. Since when do you care who I sleep with? Shane stares at you like you're his property. He likes me... He wants me. He can help me, Abs. I don't have a problem with that. You're his flavor of the month. He only cares about you because of Judas Kiss and the festival. He wants me to move in with him. You had to be high to sleep with him. God, stalker much? You're jealous of Shane. Is that what this is all about? You and me? Don't flatter yourself. Would he be so into you if he knew we broke the rules to enter Judas Kiss in the festival? Shh! Chris is right outside. Yeah, and what about Chris? He really likes you. That's between me and Chris. You want me to butt out? Butt out. Feent. Abbey, come on. Sleep with whomever you want, but be your own man, you mus. She's your biggest fan. Not anymore. So make it up to her. I didn't do anything to her. Look, before Judas Kiss and this festival, nobody at this school knew I existed. I was just the new weird kid making a movie with his fag hag. So I heard. This is a competitive place. Yeah, and I'm just trying to keep up. By shacking up with Shane? How did you know that? You think you're Shane's first bitch? Last year. The way he calls me C.W., I swear, he made me hate my own name. He promised me everything, anything I wanted. Until Mommy and Daddy Lyons met me, and my films were too weird, too bloody. Too bloody weird. So when do you meet them? Today... At the luncheon. Come here. You think I'm scared of Shane? Nothing compares to how scared he is of his parents. Think about what you're doing. I don't have a choice... Look, I told you about my dad. I need Shane's help. Those pills he's been feeding you... they helping? My dad's cutting me loose, one of the judges is out to get me. I could lose everything. I need a place to stay, a job, money. Shane can get me all those things. So you and me... we're off the table. Well, maybe we could, uh... Look. Whatever you've done to get here, I'll stand by you. I'll be your friend. But so long as you're with Shane, there can never be an us. I'd like to recognize the festival's continuing support from Richard and Annabelle Lyons, Hollywood's most generous financiers. And a heartfelt appreciation to the judges of our student competition: cinematographer Ralph Garlington, screenwriter Rebecca Lynn, and, uh... Keystone alumnus Zachary Wells. Screening of the top five student films begins at 7:00 in the Lyons Theater. Please, enjoy your dessert. Reassuring to observe your attention to hygiene, Mr. Wells. I know that what you've decided today about Danny's future changes everything for you. Why am I so important? Did you even look around as you announced my name out there? No one knew me. I know. You actually remember me? Faces and films. Frankly, with you, it was more about the film, the one that got you into this competition. Your face was pretty, but your Judas Kiss was horrifying. I've never been able to get it out of my mind. Well, it wasn't a horror film. You can't take a compliment, can you? That was supposed to be nice? Would you like my critique? Yes. No. How did you even know what I decided to do? This is the key to your future. Feent. Bitter? Would you stop sneaking up on me? This roller coaster ride's almost over. You just need to take the last loop. I know what I have to do: ruin a kid's career, my career. You already did that. Go. Go make his life different than yours. Are you okay? Yeah. Fine. This is a really good movie. Yeah. Isn't it? I mean, Judas Kiss is... I need to get some fresh air. You want me to come with? I'm fine. Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it. Hey. You all right? No... Thanks to you. That film playing in there right now, it's better than mine. I'm gonna lose this thing. So, congratulations. I know that's what you wanted. You know that, huh? Yeah, I do. You know, I wasn't bullshitting when I said I felt a connection with you. I can't get you out of my head. Believe me, I want to. Zachary Wells isn't my real name. Yeah, duh. You know? You kept telling everyone, "Please, call me Zach," like not even you believed it. So who are you? My real name is Daniel. Like me? Daniel Reyes Jr. Come on, stop joking around. I went to Lockton High School. My mom had cancer twice. She died my junior year. My dad's a controlling son of a bitch. He cheated on my mom all through her last year of life. My dad fucked my drama teacher. My dad fucked- What the fuck, shut up! Who are you? Look at me... Who am I? Who are you? What just happened? Reality, I think. So what do we do now, huh? What happens when I go back to my life and you go back to the year 3000 or whatever? Does any of this actually count? I think it's a chance for you to not make the same mistakes that I did. Don't move in with Shane. How did you know about that? He's only gonna try and control you like Dad did. Worse, even. Look, I have nowhere else to go. You don't know how many times you're gonna sell little pieces of yourself to people like Shane. Your dreams aren't worth that. God, you never fucking stop, do you? Hey, look at me! Look at me, Danny. I make cheap-ass wedding videos. I go from shitty job to shittier job. I can't keep a stable relationship. I'm a seven who gets rejected by nines. I don't even know what that means, okay? It's too late for me to save myself, but you... You can save me with your life. Jesus, look, I am not you! Please, just help me. You're a fucking quitter. I'm not! I'll do what it takes to get what I want! Hollywood is never gonna happen. Chris, the guy you gave up for the safety of being Emperor Shane's bitch, is gonna leave you in the dust and become Keystone's best-known film graduate. You've already driven Abbey away. Shut up. This is our chance. I don't know why it's happening. Maybe it's God. I don't know. But we have a chance to make our life better. You had your life... and it's gone. So any mistakes I make, they're gonna be mine. Mine! I know you cheated making Judas Kiss. Look, you hate your life so much, then just kill yourself, you fucking mus. Leave mine alone. Dude, everyone's looking for you. It's a fucking shit storm. I had to wait until I could confirm the allegation. The Judas Kiss screenplay was written before... Mr. Reyes' matriculation at Keystone. Rough night? Rough life. I used to come up here myself when I was upset about something, which was often back in the day. Drama, drama, drama. Not that I'm ungrateful, but what are you doing here? Walking down memory lane, and I tripped over you. Looks like you tripped over someone yourself. Just a little disagreement with myself. I hope you knocked some sense into yourself. And then some. I'm a mean son of a bitch. Cigarette? I've decided to quit. Well, you're a better man than me. I've learned to take a punch better than you. I want to roll back this roller coaster that you've put me on. Roller coasters only go forward. You know, I've figured out who you are. "Welds. " That's just a typo, isn't it? Frigging university's too cheap to replace it. You still go by Zachary? No one could ever get used to calling me that. Yeah, tell me about it. Well, no offense, old man, but after tonight, I'm definitely not gonna let myself turn into you. I'm sorry, Mr. Reyes. We'll have to move on to the next film. Hold on, Mrs. Blossom. Ms. Lynn? I won't argue with your rules, but I've seen Danny's film. So what if it's no longer eligible? The film's already in the projector, and the audience is here. It deserves to be seen. I agree. I do too. Me too. What's it gonna be, Mrs. B.? Roll the film. Hey, uh... I'm kinda freaking out. Mind if I just hang back here for a minute? Uh... Yeah, sure. Where the hell have you been? Why is Judas Kiss playing? With me. Where are you taking me? Just come on. Eat your dinner. I'm not hungry. You have to eat. - But I'm not hungry. - Eat! You had to let them show that piece of shit? You. Only you could've told Mrs. Blossom. Get off me! I asked you. Don't I mean anything to you? You haven't meant anything to me since you let Mom die in pain. I'm not one of your super-villains in your comic books, son. I don't have that kind of power. You betrayed her. Your mom wasn't the only one in pain, Danny. Yeah, then what about me, Dad? Huh? I was there for you. I've been there for you forever. With you, always, since I was a kid. Back then was different, for you and me both. Your mom's first cancer... Whatever happened to "Everything I do, I do because I love you, Danny boy"? Huh? Daddy? Are you okay, Daddy? Daddy? Daddy! Wake up! You know, I lied for you... Told Mom you had to work late after school. I thought I was just keeping your secrets, like always. But you actually had a new one, didn't you? One you kept from me. Daddy, you're bleeding! No. No, no. No, Jude. You'll help your old dad. Yes, Daddy. Whatever you say. And you know everything I do is because I love you, right? Yes, Daddy. Mom cried all the time, and you weren't there! But, you know, I was okay... 'cause I thought that everything Dad did was because he loves me... wants me. I... I didn't wanna lie to you. You don't have to speak to lie, Dad. We all have things we don't say. You're no different, Danny. I was nothing to you. You're overreacting. Then why don't you take me down, Daddy, just like always? I'm done with you! Do whatever you want... Away from me. Dad. Leave. What happened to you? Difference of opinion. This is certainly our most unorthodox screening. Though Judas Kiss is no longer eligible to win, I do want to recognize the efforts of its director. Ladies and gentlemen, Daniel Reyes Jr. Thank you for watching my film. I know what I did was wrong, but... I guess I just wanted everyone to know. Thanks. Now, let's proceed to tonight's awards. So this was all about you? C.W., little missy. Well, you managed to pull it off, Danny. You lose and you still win. Thanks. Well, you could've thought to thank your producer. You weren't gonna say anything. I'm sorry, I just couldn't help it. Jeez, Abs, I'm sor- Whatevs. You two enjoy your victory celebration. Well, um, why don't you two join us? He owns you now. Don't drag us into it. Hey, come along with us, C.W. Don't let him fuck up. Don't fuck up. Let's go, come on. You know, you're not supposed to be smokin' in here. Mmm. Well, I've been thinking about quitting. Maybe you're not such a mus after all. I don't know. I don't think I can take a punch. You remember, before Mom's first cancer, back when Dad was happy? We used to go camping all the time. I used to think I could just reach up and touch that moon. We don't get along too well, do we? No. I'm scared. You know, I'm coming around to the notion that roller coasters might be able to run in reverse. What the hell are you talking about? I mean that we can move in whatever direction we want- change things, patch things that we fucked up, maybe even afford the luxury of a dream or two. Are you ever gonna make sense, dude? One day... dude. I certainly hope that wasn't a Judas Kiss. You and I have had one too many betrayals. You know, I'm never gonna forget you. Yes, you will. So, time dude. Do we ever fall in love? I think you know enough about the future already. Come on. Just give me a hint. He's... Into bloody films. Bloody films and Bolex cameras? So, what? We live happily ever after? No. No? You won't be able to get rid of him, and you'll spend the next 15 years waiting for him to return your phone calls. Now... Get outta here. Key to the future. Lost and in between The way you thought it was And thought it seemed And everyone has changed Bitch. Christopher Wachowsky... How was Spain? Bloody crazy, dude. Between that and all the time zones, I couldn't return your calls. I'm so sorry. I ain't mad at you. How could you be? You love me, Danny. Only a little. So explain your weird-ass messages, because I had nothing to do with you sleeping with yourself as a kid. Let's just say I was recently inspired. We need to try something unexpected. Listen now Listen now If you want another chance You'll take it now Oh, oh When you crash Crash, crash If it goes down tonight It's the messes That you make The hearts That you will break When you crash Crash, crash Oh, don't go another day It's time to walk away When you crash Crash, crash Oh, you'll crash Crash, crash One step forward Three steps back The rain is comin' Fallin' fast Don't give in to misery When happiness Can set you free One step forward Three steps back The rain is comin' Fallin' fast Don't give in to misery When happiness Can set you free You manipulative son of a bitch! You were behind all of this. A thousand ways A thousand words Still nothin' to say A thousand ways A thousand words Still nothin' to say With every day And every night Shadows shift They take flight With every day And every night Shadows shift If I fall If I fall If I fall again Will you be Here with me If I fall again? Many times I've tried so hard But it's never enough Many times I've tried so hard But it's never enough A siren blares But no one cares They just look They just stare A siren blares And no one cares They just look If I fall If I fall If I fall again Will you be Here with me If I fall again? Bruises and scars They go so far But I want to know Bruises and scars They go so far But I want to know If I fall If I fall If I fall again Will you be Here with me If I fall again? If I fall again? A thousand ways A thousand words Still nothin' to say A thousand ways A thousand words Still nothin' To say.
