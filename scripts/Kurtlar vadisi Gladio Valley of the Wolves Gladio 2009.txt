This organisation was secret and so powerful... ...that it could influence the goverments of member countries... ...and if necessary change them. The name of this Organisation is GLADlO. VALLEY OF THE WOLVES GLADlO lskender Byk. Mother name: Cevriye. Father name: Musa. Place and date of birth: lstanbul 01 .01 .1955. Place of residence: lstanbul, Uskudar, Kuzguncuk. Nationality: Turkish. Single. No prior criminal record. Retired civil servant. - Who told you that l'm retired? - So, what are you doing? What l always did: Serving my state! And what did you do for the state? February 1993 - Bekaa Valley - What's going on, Commander? - They found out we're here! Are we going back, Commander? Come on, stand up! The soldiers are here! lt's a raid! lntercept them. Go to the Bixi! Grenade! Where's Apo? Where's Apo? - He's gone. - Gone, where? He's gone. Make her speak. Hurry. Where did Apo go? l don't know. lf in the next ten years this process shapes up... ...like we presume, then Turkey.... Professor. You have a call. lt's urgent. l'll be right back. - Hello? - Apo escaped. - What do you mean he escaped? - He simply escaped. He's somewhere here but can't find him... Where are you? lnside the house. Wait. Someone sold us out! They're surrounding us. Do you know where the canoe is? Commander! Don't! Don't move! Hands up! How was your trip? Who else knew about this operation? Just the two of us. Good! So you're the one who threw me into PKK's arms? Did you forget what we taught you about betrayal? lf it's not those who make the operation... Then it's those who gave the operation order! Sir, this is a state secret. lt doesn't concern this case. Are you going to teach me what's a state secret or not? l don't want these men. These arrogant types can't defend me. An attorney is not a clown. lt's an honorable job! lskender Buyuk, you can't stand trial without an attorney. lskender! Stop him. What are you doing? ls there a better attorney than me? l've defended my country alone for years. l can certainly defend myself. - Show the court some respect! l'm unmasking Gladio here. Do you have the guts to listen? - Your honor. This man is on trial for attempted coup. He knows that he will be sentenced to life. He just tries to evade it. This is the reason of his anxiety. l'm not afraid of death sentence, neither of life sentence. lf my state wants to see me on the gallows, l'll be there. Or to throw the keys to my dungeon, so be it. But the main issue... ...is not what the state wants... ...it's about its survival... ...to gain full independence. l will tell you. l will tell you about the second man of the Gladio! Silence! Write this down! lskender Buyuk will reveal the second man! Silence! You have a visitor! l don't want to see any visitors, don't you get it? lt's your new attorney. You have to come! Which idiot did they send this time? l don't know idiot or not! But this time it's a woman. Be ready in ten minutes. Sorry. Hi, Attorney Ayse Ylmaz. l was assigned to defend you. l don't know much about the case. lf you could inform me a little... - How old are you? - l'm 30. Actually l'm 29. But l was born in January, so you can say 30. - Who was your penal law professor? - Professor Kksal. Then leave and let him come instead. l'm going to pay him a visit; l'll give your regards to him. So... Miss Attorney. Tell me... ...should this case be handled... ...at the military penal court or here? Were you a civil servant when you've committed these crimes? - ls that how you're going to defend me? - No, sorry, l didn't mean to say so. You're going to waste my time by judging me at your will, is that so? May l correct? lf you've committed the crime in a military territory-- You've already accepted that l've committed a crime! - And you are going to defend me? - By crime l meant.... ...the criminal charge. lf there's been an illegal order, and lf we can prove that... ...they were ordered by statesmen... Military court or not? l don't know the military legislations. But after studying a little we can talk in details. Did you... ...fill in your exam sheets with this? - No. - lt figures. No one would let you pass with your ignorance. l haven't been rude to you. Aye. Look at me. l'm lskender Byk. They want my blood, my life, they want everything l have and destroy me. And that's why they send me an incapable young attorney like you. l'm used to it. But how can't you see it... ...and think that you can defend me? Don't you ever suspect that they befool you? Just as you don't doubt that you've served the country... My case... ...isn't an attorney training case. And l'm not a babysitter. Mr. lskender. Mr. lskender. Mr. Byk. Mr. Byk. - Where's his attorney? - Didn't show up, your honour. skender Byk, where's your attorney? l've sent her back to the law school. You have to settle for an attorney or l will assign one to you. And won't allow you to dismiss him. Write down. As the defendant's lawyer didn't attend the trial... Excuse me, your honor. You know, traffic in lstanbul... Delete the last sentence. Where were we in his statement? l was going to say who notified Apo about the operation. Who was your source? l told you l was brothers in arms fought shoulder to shoulder.... ...with the second man in Gladio. He gave me the orders and the information. l don't have any other source! What is the name of the second man in Gladio? l will tell his name when the time comes. Without this mentioned second man, the trial would be inadequate. My client didn't act without his knowledge. Tell his name, skender Byk. lf l say when the time comes, l'll tell it then. Since l'm on trial for a life sentence, since every single day papers... ...and the media is talking about what kind of a monster l am... ...since you're telling that l'm the one who made all the massacres... ...so you have to know to wait! lt's whatever l say... ...and whenever l want. An organization whose existence is uncertain... ...a second man whose name you don't tell. Do you also know the first man? The first man's name isn't important at all. l can say John, Jack or William. Can you bring him before the court? Where were we? ''The second man of the Gladio'' he said: ''Late President of the Republic... ...notified Abdullah calan and gave him the opportunity... ...to escape.'' - Why would he do something like this? The one who notified Apo wasn't the President. l've learned that after his death. Write down. The President isn't the one who denounced the operation... ...against the terrorist leader calan, even though l thought that it was him. l've learned the truth after the President's death! After his assassination. They can't do anything without us in this region. Mr. President, did you inform the terrorist leader... ...about the operation? What are you talking about, son? lf we could have killed the terrorist leader the organization would've... ...collapsed in a month and this issue would be over. There's nothing more dangerous for this country than talking without knowledge. Do you know what the organization is going to do... ...in the hands of Apo's successors? So, why did you give the order to kill him? Since l gave the order, you should have killed him! He knew we were there. You'll send in troops from here to Mosul... ...you'll build up you own safety zone... ...then Mosul and Kirkuk will be yours. You'll see if the countries who support terrorism... ...will obey you or not? PKK is today's issue, not tomorrow's. Tomorrow's issue is the Kurdish issue. And its solution is simple. A bigger, more democratic, more powerful Turkey! How dare you to talk like this to the President? Didn't you tell that this man sold us out? Yes, l did. But l didn't tell you to make it public like that. l'm not making it public, l'm just asking him. What was he supposed to say? ''Yes, l told him.''? He should know that it is known. Listen. You can't achieve anything by yelling. We can't make it with this president. - How come? - Listen. He does it all to invade Mosul and Kirkuk. That will lead to our separation. We talked about this many times. So, what do you say? The president will hold a press conference on Monday. He wants to make a fait accompli out of the federation issue. lf he is still President on Monday... ...there will be no Turkey no more. And we will carry the burden. No, we won't. We can't. ls there going to be anyone else in the kitchen? - No. - Good. Yaar Topu, Minister of Transport and his Kuwaiti counterpart... ...Habib Cevher Hayat have signed today an agreement... ...at the Esenboga airport. Mr Topu has stated that the protocol includes besides transportation... ...also cooperation in telecommunication. Topu further said that the protocol will strengthen the ties... ...between the two countries and-- Turgut? Turgut? Despite all efforts we couldn't save the President. Congratulations, this is it! You've wasted the fat guy. You'll go down in history. Go on, accept the congratulations! l'll do so. Today is my day. l'll accept everything! Professor Hilmi zkutlu received a call from the Presidential Residence... ...and was informed about the state of the President. Meanwhile the President was being sent to the... ...Glhane Military Hospital. Brigadier General Prof. Dr. mer arlak was informed. Because of the emergency, the President was accepted to the Hacettepe Hospital. What's going on? No more calls. l've unplugged it. What happened? This Ersever, he's getting on my nerves! He's a bit crazy but fine. Did he hear it? What did he say that annoyed you this much? Nothing. He sent his regards. lf we can find this second man... ...you can walk away free. How am l going to do that? The confession of the second man would change the course of this case. When this secret organization is unmasked you would only receive a minor sentence. Bravo. You start talking like a lawyer. Fancy legal words and such. But you forget something. Do you realize how dangerous this organization is? l respect what you've done for this country... ...not as a lawyer but as a human. Forget it. - l've read about you... - l said forget it. Winning this case... ...will make me the most famous lawyer in Turkey. l guess l don't have to say that this man has to appear before court. Get me out of here... ...and leave the guy to me. lf we can find him, it would be easier to arange a release. Make them transfer me to a hospital. He'll come to me. You've got diabetes, can you fake a faint? The former commander of JlTEM... ...Major Ahmet Cem Ersever... ...has invited him to Ankara... ...and asked from him to come alone-- Why did he want you to come alone? - He didn't want him to know. - Who's him? - Him. - Who's he? skender Byk, you're wasting our time. You're going to tell us the name of the second man in your organization. l'm not telling that name... ...to protect your lives. Order. Water. Your Honour, my client has diabetes, can l give him water? Do so. Are you better now? Let me open up the drip a bit. Put on your badge. How am l supposed to know that you are a doctor? lf you should need anything... ...press the button and our friends will come to help. You're going to be discharged tomorrow morning. Good night. Fuat? Are you ok? l feel awful. l can't drive. ls this your hideout? Nobody would think about this place. Do you think we're running away from guards? l'm telling you, Gladio. l'm totally down and can't listen. l have to breath. You can breathe off-shore. - Off-shore? - Start the engine. What now? You're going to be suspended. l don't give a damn about that. l've killed someone. There is a time... ...in life where everybody is forced to kill. You just had that moment. You'll find out what's going to happen as you go along. l can't live with that. l'm going to turn myself in. Let's find Fuat and l'll take the blame for that. Do you think you can find a solution for everything? My fingerprints are on the gun. That's not important. You won't be able to sleep a couple of nights... ...you'll have nightmares, feel sick... ...you'll hate yourself... ...then it'll pass. You've solved this too. Thanks. You wanted to be famous, now you are. l wanted to be famous with my profession. - Listen Ayse. - Leave me alone! Here? l'm not coming with you. As long as l don't turn myself in, it won't matter if you do. - Anyway. - Stop being so stubborn. You'll do as l say. - How are you going to find him? - l know where to find him. - Are we waiting for Fuat Aras? - No. We're waiting for the man who'll lead us to him. Maybe he's inside? We would've noticed. He travels with a crowd and very loud. You had a good relationship with this second man, right? When did you become enemies? l've erred many times in my life. But was only deceived once. How? l didn't know we actually served Gladio. We were an independent team working for the State, l have thought. November 1993 - Ankara - You're alone, right? - You said so. - Did you tell anyone you're here? - No. Come in. Get us tea. Did you say Fuat anything? No. Let's talk first. l'll tell him if necessary. He fooled all of us. We didn't notice. Who? l'm going to bed. Go then! Get out of my sight! You didn't get any sleep in the mountains. You were on watch the whole night. Cem. Cem, calm down. Nothing will happen to you. We won't let that happen. Who did inform Apo about the operation? - The President. - That's a bull! l've asked him myself. He didn't say no. Who do you think Fuat is? Listen, lskender. We have sold drugs together. We also sold weapons. What else? What do you know about Fuat? We thought we were doing everything for the state. Who did get the money? Fuat. l have a file on that. All files will surface one day. l know every breath Fuat takes. Even his call to Apo is in the file. Show me. - Do you think l'd keep it here? - What do you want from me? You're going to read the file. But l need a favor. You'll mediate between me and that bastard. l will burn the file and he'll let me live abroad. l have a question. Why should Fuat do such a thing? Planing an operation with me and then informing Apo? Do you think you're protecting your fatherland? After a while there won't be an lskender. They'll dump you somewhere. That bastard Fuat, is from Gladio. Which Gladio? You've freaked out and suspect everybody. Who did pick you and me? Because we were good soldiers? Why are they wasting us now? skender, don't ever forget. You would order the worstjob... ...to the best patriot. Do you see any of us in the command ranks? No. Where are we? At the front. All decisions come from abroad. They decide who's with Gladio and who's not. Where is the file? Come back tomorrow You'll get to see it. Call me, Fuat. lt's me, skender. - Where are you, skender? - With a friend. Which friend? You don't know him. Come to the warehouse, when you're done there. lt's important. Come skender. Cem was explaining how he betrayed us. He was just about to say where he hid the money, when you arrived. - Which money? - You corrupt bastard. Did we trust in him? We did. Did we make him leader of the anti-terror unit? We did. He sold drugs together with PKK. What did Cem tell you? Do you think this dog saves his pension? Shouldn't we punish him for that, skender? Who doesn't sell drugs these days? Fine, l'm not against selling drugs. He sold our weapons to PKK and got heroine for it. l asked him where he got the weapons from. That bastard says ''From lskender.'' And the money, where is it? Hidden. l'm fed up with that. The punishment for betrayal is certain. Shoot him one in the head! We need to talk. Are you two partners? We need to talk. Are you two partners... ...or not? Chief, leave the house immediately. What's this assasination? l've declared truce... ...but you want to kill me. Stop talking. The special forces are at your door. Get out of there. - Chief, leave the house immediately. - What's this assasination? l've declared truce but you want to kill me. Strange. l was scared when l saw you the first time. Your name was so big... ...l thought you could read my mind. But...? l didn't think that you could be deceived. Have you ever been in love? Why? l loved my country so much... ...that l couldn't see anything else. Not even Fuat and Gladio who were right under my nose. Don't move! Step out of the car! l held her at gunpoint and told her to come with me. Why did you take your lawyer along? Why did you need her? l thought l would arise less suspicion with a woman lt didn't look like you used force. Well, she's not my enemy. Only my lawyer. Although l abducted her. Are you going to be suspended? l won't let go of this case. l believe in your innocence. l'll do anything in my power to prove it. They are going to disbar your lawyer. She won't be able to work as lawyer any longer. l'm not going to eat. Dog of the state! Did you lose your master? skender! Gladio's bastard! Lawyer Haim trk. Sir. l didn't have much time to investigate your case. l'm going to ask for an extension from the court. Forget the extension. We don't need time. Did you talk to my lawyer? Just on the phone. She sent me the files. You didn't mention the name of the second man. Blent Fuat Aras. Excuse me? Blent... Fuat... Aras. There is now an investigation about the death of the President. They're going to get your statement. We should prepare our case. Do you need anything? l have to talk to skender Byk for five minutes. l'm sorry. Give us two minutes. Fine. Please. l wanted to wish you good luck. Are you OK? Yes. l'm on vacation. And you? l'm better now. l've run over the details with your lawyer. l don't know your decision yet but you have to give Fuat's name. What are you doing? We did find your Fuat. - And where is he? - Blent Fuat Aras. Born in 1937. Professor. Fine, fine. That's him. Blent Fuat Aras died in 1994. Are you making fun of us? Fuat Aras is alive. Did you find that? No. We found his grave. l'm telling you Fuat Aras is alive. Are we going to believe you or the state? Well, l believed the State. You shouldn't. l will tell the court... ...the whereabouts of Fuat Aras... ...but only in private. - What do you mean? - Your honor. We want a closed session. Fuat Aras is alive. He is in lstanbul. We want to know where he is but you're not telling us anything. You don't have the power to bring him here. Your honor, the authorities would obstruct the search for Fuat Aras. - That's what Mr. Byk means. - Set me free. l'll bring him myself. He wants to be released. That's for sure. The accused has a nice plan. He wants to put the blame on a deceased man and walk free. Were you at the concert hall because this man is an opera fan? That wasn't Fuat. l was waiting for the man who would lead me to him. - And who's that? - l can't disclose his name either. He is a 4-star general. You don't get it. Forget the police. Even if you go to the general... ...you'd stand there in awe, shake his hand... ...and return. And Fuat would burry him instantly. January 1994 - lstanbul Our financial support to your paper doesn't seem to have an end. With the money we gave you, we could've bought Turkey. Come on. The paper prices go up. The government is pressing us. We fight for independence on our own. Are you telling me how independent you are? There should be a lighter somewhere. lt's in the drawer. What's going on? You're deep underground, Fuat. Here we are. You and me. Give me a decent answer... ...so l bury you here and walk away. Take it off. You're going to tell me everything. Fuat, who are you? Huh? Who are you working for? Who else is on your team? - They have deceived you. - You did. We risked our lives together. Whoever told you this is deceiving you. l can prove it all. Why are you smiling? l took you for smarter. Such a pity. Chief, leave the house immediately. What's this assasination? l've declared truth... At least you're going to tell the truth on your way to hell. skender. We have big plans. lf you don't do anything stupid... ...then we'll control the entire country. Everything works for us. The American have a new project. They're ready to do whatever it takes. l'm sorry. They'll have to do without you. The American have endless projects. Come on lskender, military coup. Come on lskender, the USSR will break up. Come on lskender, Central Asia. Come on lskender, Middle East. Come on lskender, independence. skender is great... ...but worn out. We did love our country, man. Not a whore that causes us trouble day and night. Stop or l'll kill him. Pride Night For The Retired General You have a visitor. At this hour? The judge wants to see you. How shall l know that he is the judge? He should come here if he wants to see me. Give me an hour. Fuat will tell you the rest, not me. The President made you the chief of the intelligence. And you made a coup. The President gave me a duty... ...and that l did. We did the coup of Februar 28th all together. We thought that the effect of this postmodern coup... ...would last 1000 years. lt lasted only 5. So we gave up the idea of postmodern coup... ...and decided to make a classic one. Why were you not able to do it? General Notac is not coming. We're aborting the operation. What does that mean? lt means we've come to light. So what? Everything will be over in no time. We'll have the control. Are you planning a coup? You can do as you wish after l'm retired. A coup is a man's job. Don't go crying because the country is run by this imam. Soon you'll end up praying together. lf Yetim finds out about this then we're done. As long as Yetim is chief of staff... ...this coup is bound to be an orphan. Rewind that. More, more. Stop. Slow motion. Stop. Can you zoom in on that guy. Can you sharpen it? Damn you and your whole family. Let him in. - Erhan, you can leave. - Yes, sir. We did the right thing. lf we hadn't aborted the operation they would've made the people lynch us. Fuat, right? Which Fuat? You acted on his orders, right? Get out of my sight! Who do you think you are to talk to me like that? He asked you to bring me in on this, right? You're crazy. You'll be sentenced to death for this. General, did you inform the others? Sure he did. He told them what kind of a bastard you are. Sir? Release me before he runs away. l've dedicated my life to put people like you behind bars. You can still do that. But notjust me. Put everyone like me, all Gladio members... ...all gang members behind bars. They all say ''We were used.'' ''The state ordered us and we did it.'' l'm not saying that l'm innocent. l want to fulfil my last duty against my nation, my state... ...my country. Let me find this Fuat and bring him in. Then we can clean this mess. lf you take this for a duty then be a secret witness. And l'll set all authorities in motion... ...and take them all in. You won't get anywhere with statements and witnesses. Don't you get it? Unless they are all unmasked... ...we can't achieve anything. They are everywhere. Maybe you're one of them. And l talk in vain. Just a second. You can do it in your cell. - ls there a problem? - l'm waiting for the guardian. - l'll give him a lift to the bus station. - Fine. Mr. Aydn. What are you doing, are you insane? There is no return for me. Your trunk is open. - Thank you. l won't forget this. lf you're lying, l'll be in the next cell from you. Then l won't forget what you've done either. Maestro. lt was marvellous. My congratulations to you and friends. Please. We're just performers. You've created a masterpiece. l'll be right back. Selim? What are you doing here? You have a disgusting music taste. l'm here to puke. What do you want from me? Where is Fuat Aras? Music Will Miss The General To Nizam. This is it. l said ''This is it.'' Are you deaf? What are you doing? You're making a mistake. - Sir, you're deeply mistaken. - Shut up, Fuat. Which Fuat? This is a mix-up. A likely story. Sir. You're making a big mistake. Move. Come on. Lie, huh? Your whole world is based on lies. Even your humping is not real. lf l hadn't wished so you're heart would've been still now. You would've died in that ambulance. l didn't let that happen. You're so fond of me, huh? You still had many services to do for us. We invested a lot effort in you. Where's your Gladio? Are they going to come with a chopper now? skender. Let us fight together against them. - Against whom? - l know their weak spots. We'll use Gladio. l have many experienced men. We could run this land and control the region. You're about to die but still keep talking about... ...ruling, deception and lies. Why would l deceive you? l was going to tell you all. l was waiting for the right moment. Forget it. Tell me why you're back. Because of you. You chase anything to the end. Go. Go to jail. lt's very comfortable there. Do you know what you don't get? You're going to die. Even if you kill me or not. After all what you've told in the court... ...you'll be wasted. Nevermind who's going to be wasted. You'll be the first to be wasted. - Where's Fuat? - Dead. Are you ok? Yes. Just some little problems because of my diabetes. Shall l bring you insuline? So, what's your decision? l gave the judge my word. l'll go back and tell everything. The man is dead, you don't have any documents. This is futile. They will provide all sorts of documents to put the blame on Fuat. Why did Gladio give up on Fuat Aras? A new era has begun. And there's no place for Fuat. The Neo-Ottoman era. lt is obvious that in the Middle East the Arabs and lsraelis... ...won't make peace. The Arabs need a shepherd so that they don't... ...keep blowing each other up. Would the Arabs listen to us? They will. As long as the Arabs are ruled by puppets... ...they will listen to us. Why do you want to know? Are you going to be a politician or Gladio member? l'm just curious. ls Turkey trustworthy? Ask the kids, they all want to be prime minister. Some even want to conquer the whole world. lf there is no trouble brewing for the Turks... ...then the Turks would be a trouble to the whole world. That's why they want to separate the Kurds. But they will fail. They sit in a lab and produce projects. They seem to fit in the lab, but won't fit us. How shall we know who's from Gladio? lf there is a crowd... ...and a violent minority in it... ...Gladio is there. Dear Aye, can you give me water? He didn't have any bodyguards. Not even a carriage did follow us. Now you're in trouble too. How come? You're now an enemy of Gladio. l'm not their enemy. You're not going to be able to talk anymore. You don't have anything to tell anyway. Come in. Come in, counsellor. l came to congratulate you. Thanks. You didn't have to. - Good luck for your new post. - Thank you. l'll be expecting your visit if you should come to Ankara. l've got many cases in the supreme court. Were you sent to Ankara because you refused to close... ...the Gladio case? - They've decided like this. lf you go, nobody will take on the Gladio case. lskender has opened a big, wide road for us. Not only the justice system should follow that road... ...but also the entire nation. lstanbul 28, Bursa 29. zmit and Balikesir... skender Byk was found guilty on all charges. He is now in a welfare home because of his illness. Some experts criticize that the Gladio case... ...is still open. They claim that the organization is now unmasked... ...and that this decision is a mistake. Some lawyers say that unless all members of Gladio are not brought to daylight... ...the organization can never be destroyed. The future will show who's right. One thing is for sure, Gladio will stay... ...on Turkey's agenda for a long time.
