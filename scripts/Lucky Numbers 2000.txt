Thank you. Thank you. All right. You have a good day. - [ All Screaming ] - Bye! [Man] They say the only luck is the luck you make. In the winter of 88, i was the luckiest man alive. I had it all - fame, fortune and my own parking space... at Harrisburg's trendiest bistro. I would have done anything to keep it all. And, unfortunately, i did. - Jack, how are ya? - Good morning, Mr. Richards. - Did you get a haircut? - Oh, yes. Looks good. Don't get too good-looking. I'll be out of a job. [ Chuckles ] Oh, how about this winter weather, eh? Farmer's Almanac sure didn't get it right this year. "Caterpillar in June, cold winter soon," they said. Amateurs, Jack. Hillbilly folklore, that's all it is. You should write your own almanac, Mr. Richards. Something people could believe in. Maybe one day I will, Jack. Maybe one day I will. - Enjoy your breakfast. - Good morning. - Wendy, how are you? -Just fine. - Yeah. How's the cold? - Oh, it's just allergies, I think. Really? Oh, not allergic to me, are you? No. [ Laughs ] I don't think so. - You're so bad. - Guilty as charged. I'll be right back with your cantaloupe and egg whites. - Okay. You pick me a ripe one. - Excuse me, Mr. Richards. - Sorry, but can I get a picture? -Well, sure. It's my son's birthday, and he saw you walk in. - What's your name, skipper? - Sam. Sam. Well, you're a big fella, Samarino. How old are you today? Twenty-seven? [ Chuckles ] I'm five. Five? Well, how's the wife? Allright. Happy birth day. - Thanks for coming by. All right. - Thank you. - Oh, you gotta love it. - Wow. You're Russ Richards, aren't you? Last time I checked. Well, hello! Hi. Here. Let meguess. Mmm. It's a resume of some sort, and you're looking for a job in broadcasting. Yeah, just read it. Asshole. You are Mr. Lucky today. I found you the ripest melon in Harrisburg. - Christmas don't be late - Fuck! [ Announcer ] Live from Harrisburg and News Center Six. Covering Harrisburg, York, Lancaster and Lebanon, it's Newsat Five with Dan Shuff, Heidi Zimmer... and Russ Richards with the weather. This is Newsat Five. [ Man ] Good evening. A teacher is behind bars tonight... for allegedly locking an unruly student in a broom closet. That story coming up. But first, let's check in with the weather center... to see if these beautiful temperatures will continue. - Russ? - Yes, it's the middle of December, and we still have more Now don't panic, folks. You're not in the twilight zone. [ Humming Theme from Twilight Zone ] Now, on the downside, if the weather gets any nicer, my Aunt Mildred could move back from Fort Lauderdale. Just kidding. A wonderful woman. Anyhoo, I'll be back with a complete forecast a little later. Take it, Dan. Thanks, Russ. We'll check in with you later. [Man] And now the fourth. [Woman] Eleven. [Man] And the fifth number, please. - Hi, Russ. - [Woman] Thirty. Hey, Dottie. How are you? - Still struggling with the diet. - Oh, yeah? Don't get too thin. It's not good for you. Eight. [ Man ] And there you have it. Tonight's Pennsylvania Lottery number: 19, 47, If you have it, come and get it. - If not, better luck next time. - Back to you, Dan. - We gonna talk about this? - Nothing to talk about, Cochise. I told you no more loans. Penn Fed's down the street. This is not... Not a loan. An advance. Stop acting like it's coming out of your pocket. If you didn't piss your money away, you wouldn't need an advance. Now, what is it this week-- racquet ball courts? Pee wee golf? Snowmobiles. You know it. I told you that. Jesus Christ. It's exhausting with you. Snowmobiles. How's business? When this heat wave ends, I'm golden. - You're the weatherman. End it. - [Groans] - Where the hellishe? - CrystaI! How many times do I have to tell those guys about the cables? I almost broke my fucking neck on live television! Yeah. Oh, sorry. I didn't realize you were in the middle of a meeting. No, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down. - Calm down. - You know... - Come with me. - I have to leave, of course. I talked to them about this thing. It's never gonna happen again. All right? Just relax. It's not gonna happen again. - Hi, boss. - Hello. How you doing, Bobby? I can't do the Olive Garden tonight. - [ Scoffs ] - My wife invited a few people over. - I've gotta eat at home. - That's just great, Dick. No, you know what? I am tired of this bullshit. Hey, hey, hey. Easy. Come on. Remember, we got that affiliates thing coming up. - Uh-huh. - Six days in Hawaii. - Mm-hmm. - Eating like pigs. Christ, you got some body on you. [ Giggles ] Tell me something I don't know. Do we have anything else? I think we're through here. Unless you want to torture me about the fucking weather chopper. Like that was a bad idea. Weather chopper? Come on, I'm a weatherman. You know what the truth is? I feel bad foryou, Dick. I do. One day you're gonna wake up, and you're gonna realize... you had a diamond in your hand, and you let it slip away. To where, Atlantic City? - Oh, that's what this is about. - To be a big game show host. That's right. I hear everything. I'm like a satellite in outer space. Did you get your audition? - My agent is all over it. - Right. [ Chuckles ] [Russ] Mace Kornberg, please. Yes, this is Russ Richards. Mm-hmm. You know, this is getting a little ridiculous. I've already left, like, five messages. Allright, your boss, Mace Kornberg, saw me on TV, okay? He loved me, okay? He wants to represent me. We... We sat at my personal booth at Denny's... for over an hour, and i told him all about myself. And now for some reason, he's not returning my phone calls. Well, what part ofthat was too long? Just tell him Russ Richards called, okay? Thankyou. [ Sighs ] What's happening? Still not there? Nah, but, the whole agency is out for the week. - A retreat or something. - What's a retreat? Oh, I'm not sure, but I think it's a religious thing. - Hey, i got great news for you. - Oh, yeah? Yeah. Remember my brother's car, the one that was in a wreck? For the sake of expediency, i am going to say yes. Well, he's finally ready to sell it. It's all pounded out, repainted, and ready to go. Beautiful lime-green finish. Looks just like a popsicle. Now, Larry, is there some reason that I should know this? Just if you decide the Jag is too much of an extravagance. I'm not selling the Jag. I'd sell my body parts to South America before that. Okay. You're the boss. Yeah, I am the boss. Here's another news flash for you. I'm not losing the house either. You know what you laymen fail to realize? It's not about the snowmobiles. Come on. It's about the weather, okay? One cold front, a little moist air, and bam! I'm Rockefeller. I'm on Broadway. I'm doing the cha-cha-cha. Yeah! [ Moaning ] Oh, God! Oh, whip me forever! Oh! Oh! Oh! [ Both Moaning ] [ Russ Sighs ] Boy, whew! That is always such a treat. Oh, with Dick, it's like having sex with a sloth. Don't put that image in my head. Here. Try this just one time. - No. - Yeah, it'll help you relax. I don't even want a contact high. It makes me nauseous. You shouldn't even be smoking it. You're the lotto girl. You practically work for the state. Put it out. Okay, I'm putting it out. - I have a question to ask you. - Yeah? If you had an agent, and you tried to get him for two weeks, eight times, and he didn't return your call, what would you think? - Um... - Huh? I can't relate. I've never had a guy not call me back. Oh! I just don't get it. When I met... I met this guy, he was... he was gushing. He wanted to do this for me, he wanted to do that. I've had my ass kissed, but this was really special. So he is officially your agent? It's not like you had one meeting. It's splitting hairs here, you know. I mean, it was clear he wanted to sign me. You know what he said to me? He said that I delivered the weather forecast with a Shakespearean flair. [ Chuckles ] Was he drunk? No, he wasn't drunk. What's wrong with you? Look. If the guy's not returning your calls, then fire his ass. Just hire someone else. What's the biggie? - Do you know who Mace Kornberg is? - Uh-uh. Do you have any idea of the pedigree of this man? Here's a little primer foryou. He only handled Gene Rayburn at the height of The Match Game. Wow. All right, so he is kind of a big shot. Yeah, congratulations. You just won the Cutlass. I wouldn't be caught dead driving a Cutlass. I'll trade it in. Well, how about door number two? Old reliable. [ Giggles ] Wait. You're in a very small, select group of guys. What is it that makes you successful... and all the others knocking on the doors not so successful? Well, I'm not so sure. You know, as i travel around the country, I see on television guys that would make good game show hosts. But i don't tell them. No. The analogy is a game show host is the icing on the cake, but the format is the cake. - Yeah, format is the cake. - To me, Dick Clark, for all the things he does, is an outstanding game show host. He stays out of the way. He lets the format work. And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's your host, Russ Richards! And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's your host, Russ Richards! [TV Continues, indistinct] So, Russ, it sounds like we can keep those scarves and mittens... in moth balls a while longer then. That's what it sounds like, Dan. And the sleds and snowmobiles can stay in the garage. That is correct, Heidi. I think we all get the point. [Dan] Thanks, Russ. We'll check in with you later. - [ Answering Machine Beeps ] - Hello. You have one message. [ Beep ] [ Man ] Uh, yes. This message is for Rob Richards. This is Sandy from the Gabler-Kornberg Agency. I'm sorry no one got back to you, but we were away on a retreat. - Apology accepted, Sandy. - I wanted to let you know... that Mr. Kornberg is dead. He passed away around eight months ago. I'm sure had he not, he would've returned your call. - Oh, jeez! - He went quickly. - Yeah. Yep. - Bye-bye. - [ Beep ] - That was your last message. [ Sighs ] Yep, that was my last message. [Rock] Russ, let me get this straight. You don't drink. You don't do coke. You're not a pussy hound. Well, what the fuck did you blow your money on? It just.. lt just went, okay? Does it matter? What was that? That's Carla, the Human Cannon. - Oh, she's good. - She's Dutch. - Russ, we go way back. - Right. And i like you. I do. I'm a fan. But 25 grand. I don't think i can lay my hands on that kind of money. - Oh. - Especially now. I'm going through a very messy divorce. - I'm sure you understand. - Sure. I do now. Okay. Take care, Gig. Thanks a lot. Take care. Hypothetically speaking, it's not like you're without options. What do you mean? Well, you do have options. What are they? Come. Speak up. Hello? Take your glasses off. - [ Hums ] - Well, what is that? Russ, i assume you have insurance on your dealership. Yeah, so? Don't you think now would be the appropriate time to, you know, make a few claims on, you know, some of those premiums? Oh, God. Oh, jeez! Are you talking about arson? The last thing you want to get involved with, mate, is arson. Well, that's right. Yes, of course not. The way to beat an insurance company these days is with a phony robbery. Oh, God. [ Scoffs ] You are veering in that direction. That makes me very uncomfortable. First of... Look. If i weren't, okay, the president of the Rotary, the vice president of the Sunshiny Day Club... and i'm a Big Brother, Gig. Russ, it's your money. [ Sighs ] The insurance company is earning interest off it. The whole "man ofthe people," nice guy thing, it's quaint, but don't you think it's time to put a cap on it, hmm? [ Exhales ] Well, how would it work? You know, like, you know, hypothetically speaking. How would, you know, how would it go down? - Well, it's nothing. - No? If i were to put it in medical terms... where you would equate brain surgery with a bank robbery, this would be like a visit to the podiatrist. - Hmm. - And it just so happens... I have an acquaintance named Dale who is a specialist in this area. It's a very simple procedure, Russ. The whole thing would take... Forty? Wow. Fortyminutes, tops. Dale arrives at your dealership on a prearranged night with his crew. [Man] lt's so easy to blowup your problems - [ Continues ] - Findshis way inside. Leaves the telltale signs of a break-in... and gains entrance. Then it's just a simple matter of getting thes leds out the back. I mean, the actual extraction process is the easiest bit. And, uh, that's that. All that's left is between You and your insurance company. End of story. Easy as pie. I, of course, would command the standard 20 percent consultation fee. - I figured that. - You know, it's up to you, Russ. I mean, only if you're ready for something like this. That visit to the podiatrist. Well, it's like removing a bunion or something. An ingrown toe nail, at the very most. Funny. Okay. Okay. Well, make the call then. Good choice. I was in the right place, but it must've been the wrong time I was saying the right things but i must've used the wrong line - I was on the right trip - All right. Let's do this cocksucker. - [Continues] - All right. Let's do it. I've been running trying to get hung up in mymind This is so cool. You can just come in here anytime you want. Yeah, i got the keys, don't i? All right. This one's for Charlie Hustle, okay? The pricks wanna keep him out of Cooperstown? I wasin the wrong place, but it must've been the right time - Home run. - I wasin the rightplace It's happening right this second. Send a squad car now! I was in the right world, but it seemed like a wrong, wrong - [Sirens Wailing] - Come on. Move it! Let me just ask you one question, Your Honor. Where's my bat? Don't worry about your bat, asshole. [Phone Ringing] [Ring] - Yeah? - I'm gonna break your fucking face. - What? - You better have a bag of money... the fucking second they set bail, or i'm telling them who hired me. I also want an extra ten grand for my pain and suffering. - Are we clear, weatherman? - No, we're not clear. We're the furthest thing from clear. I don't even know who you are. Look. A second ago i was asleep. And two seconds ago, i was in a blueberry field with my mother, and we were getting along really well. Save that for your psychiatrist. I want my ten grand. Stop it! Stop saying that! - I don't have ten grand. - Oh, no? You'd better sell something or kill someone. I don't care! You just get me my fucking money! - What... - [ Dial Tone ] [ Sighs ] Okay, Russ. It's gonna be a better day. - [Woman] Russ Richards! Hi! - How are you? Merry Christmas. Okay. Mmm. - Scoop-a-doop, Russ, love. - What are you doing here? - Problem. - What? Dale the Thug's getting a bit pissy about his ten grand. Dale the Thug? Dale the Thug? That's his nickname? When did that happen? Oh, that's childhood issues. Trust me, you don't wanna know. He was fine for a day or two, but now he's had time to stew, see? Good morning. What can I get you? - Can I have coffee? With milk. - Okay. - Do you have those apple pastries? - Wendy. - The pastries with cinnamon swirls. - Wendy, he's not staying. - He's leaving, okay? - Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks for asking. [Giggling] I cannot be seen with you. I am a public figure. Russ, you don't return my calls. I'm doing you the favor. If there's a Dale the Thug issue, time tends to be of the essence. I'm tapped out. The money i got for the Jag barely covered his bail. I am not having this conversation here with you. Th-There's an omelette named after me, for God's sake! - What's in it? - You leave that alone! Just go! - Really? Really. - I'll follow you. Yes! Hmm. Well, I'll... Um, Russ, i'lljust be outside then? - Oh, God! - Right? - Let's go. - On top of everything else, they've impounded his baseball bat as evidence. He bought it at an auction. Pete Rose hit with it or some shit. He shouldn't have used it then. Christ, even a plumber knows... to take his ring off before he snakes the drain. - You screwed up, he got pinched. - I did not screw up! I can't control the sexual appetite of my employee. I mean, either way, you're gonna have to pay for it. Why don't you just do this? Take... Just get it over with. Why don't you just set up an appointment at his convenience... to come break my legs or kick me in the nuts or whatever? You know what? I very much doubt it'll be the latter. That's practically how he treats his friends. You know, Russ, I've been thinking about your situation, and it occurs to me that sometimes in life... the greatest opportunities are sitting right underyour nose. Only thing under my nose is this mat with presidents up to Carter. - Am i missing something? - The lottery. Oh, that is so stupid! You think my playing the lottery is going to solve all my problems? Not playing the lottery, winning the lottery. You got that lotto ball machine down at the station, right? A little razzle-dazzle, you're set for life. Gig, i just came off a botched phony robbery. Let me bask in that a while before i start thinking about tampering... with the fucking state lottery! I'm not talking out of my ass here. - I do have experience with this. - Really. Yeah. About ten years ago, before I washed up on these golden shores, - I rigged a bingo game at church. - Church, huh? Weighed down a few ping-pong balls, Bob's your uncle! I walked away with a fucking lawn mower. - Oh, a lawn mower. Wow. - This is not Warand Peace, merely the concept of gravity. No, no, the concept of gravity... is when you fall down and you break your head open. Well, your glass is obviously half empty. No, Gig, my glass is totally empty. - Watch it! - Hate you! - Calm down! - Bastard! Calm down. You're acting like a child. - Stop! Calm down, please. - You promised! - What do you want me to do? - What's going on? Everything's fine. Thank you. She wanted to go. What do you want me to say? "I'm sorry. I'm banging the lotto ball girl, and i promised her first." I don't believe i bought sandals in December for no reason! I'll take you next time. In June, l have a conference in Seattle. Take your wife to fucking Seattle, all right? I wanted to go to Maui, you asshole! Oh, I'm an asshole. Am i the same asshole... that takes you out to dinner and buys you fancy European underwear? Try to get that from the weatherman, who i notice you've been awfully chatty with these days. Blow me. - Is everything okay? - Yes, everything's fine! [Man] I'm dreamin'of a white Christmas Just Iike the ones i used to know Where the tree tops glisten And children listen To hearsleigh bells in thesnow Oh, I'm Dreaming of a white - [Fades] - I have to ask you something. - What? - Oh, God. Oh, God. I don't know how to askyou this. [ Exhales ] -Just ask. - I wouldn't blame you for saying no. As a matter offact, i already expect you to say no. But I need your help on something. Aah! We're gonna be millionaires! I can't believe this! I have to admit, I thought it would be a slightly harder sell. All right, most important thing... is getting alone with that machine... five minutes before and five minutes after the broadcast. - That's key. - That's as key as it gets. Five minutes before, five after. Did you hear that, Crystal? I'm two inches away. How could I not hear it? Start taking notes, 'cause when Gig and i start hashing it out, there's gonna be gold flying around, and I don't want to miss any of it. - The first piece of gold is this. - Yeah. I think someone should call in a bomb scare. Then the building gets evacuated, and i'm alone with the lotto balls. Okay? Are you writing this down? - When we decide, i'll write it. - It's good, right? Russ, um, forgive me. Just a second. You call in a bomb scare, they evacuate the building, and shut down the broadcast. Right, then the firemen will come... and then the policemen will come, so kind of a lame idea, you know? All right. Jeez. It's just an idea. It's a work in progress, for God's sake. Even a painter's got to take the brushes and clean them. - Whatever that means. - Any better ideas, Smarty-pants? Why can't i distract Bobby somehow, the security guy? And then you switch the balls. - No, uh, lame. That's lame. What? - No, that's brilliant. - Yeah? - It's so simple, it's brilliant. In its simplicity, Russ. Simplicity. That's... - And moving on. - Okay, moving on. Moving on, i guess. - Next most important thing, right? - Uh-huh. We need to find your beard? What the hell's a "beard"? You need someone to buy the ticket and claim the winnings. But it has to be someone that you absolutely trust. - One beard. Check. - Time out, folks! There's not a person i would trust to do this thing. Not a single person. Ah! Oh, God! Oh, God. Okay. All right. I buy the ticket in disguise. Okay? And this eliminates all the outsiders. That's the answer. That's it. Okay? Yeah, yeah. Now we're cooking with gas, huh? I mean, how would you disguise yourself? What, as Charlie Chaplin? As The Tramp or something? [Laughing] Yeah, orno, Iike, from The Wizard of Oz. - The straw guy. - The straw man. Yeah, he could put hay in his clothes and wear a hat. - With a pom-pom on it? - No one will know it's him. - Ooh, it's clever. - Nobody would everknow! - No! Russ. - It's Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz. - Oh, okay. - It's Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, it's the Tin Man, it's the dog, it's the flying monkeys... and it's the Scarecrow. If you're gonna make fun of me, get your facts straight. Well, my apologies, sir. I am not the cartoon aficionada that you are. - It's not a cartoon, Crystal. - So what? - It's a movie. - Who gives a shit? - Children... Excuse me. - [Arguing] - It's a movie! For God's sake. - Calm down. Calm down. - Calm... Calm down. - Sorry. - Please? - All right. Back to square one. [ Chuckles ] Let's go. Hey, I know. My cousin Walter could do it. - Who? - From Ohio. He would be the perfect beard. He's this totally straight guy. He doesn 't even drink, and besides, he hasa crush on me. The minute You walked in the joint I could see you were a man of distinction A real big spender - Good-looking, so refined - Oh. Walter. Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind - I got you balloons. We should go. - Thankyou. So let me get right to the point I got you a room at a lovely country inn. I don't pop my cork for every guy i see Hey, big spender Spend a little time with me - Oh. It's so green and lush. - [Russ] Oh! Lookat this room! - [Russ] Oh, this is so great. - Look at this TV, a closet. - God, look at the painting. And this clock with a little light. It's so... It's so modern-day. - [Crystal] Oh, shower curtain. - Oh, Walter, look at this. All-you-can-eat buffet. Oh. Right up the block! - [ Wheezing, Coughing ] - And towels all prepared for you. - How comfy. What do you think? - Yeah, what do you think? - [ Gasps ] Mold spores. - What? This room has a high content of mold spores. - My throat's closing up. - Oh, jeez. - [ Gasping, Wheezing ] - Oh. [ Wheezing Continues ] - Are you all right, Walter? - [ Wheezing ] Mm. Tsk. [ Exhaling, Gurgling ] [ Wheezing ] Oh, jeez. - All clear. - Thank God for modern medicine. - Yeah. - Hey, Walter, test the bed. It's a combination of the heat and moisture. That's what does it. Yeah. Is it always this sticky in Harrisburg in the winter? Well, you know, it's... it's a fluke, of course, but it's not entirely uncommon, no. - Uh-uh. - W-Why's that? Well, okay, well, historically, weather has been unpredictable. - Yeah, well, w-why's that? - Why? - [ Sniffling ] - Well... Well, okay, you got... Your, uh... you got your cold fronts and you got... your warm fronts, and then you're talking barometric pressure. - Well, without my gauges, i.. i.. - I love hotels. Walter? Walter? Hey! Walter. - Yeah? - Are you clear on what we're doing? How long will it be be-before i get my money? - Oh, well... - Oh. Yeah, no. Um, it's real simple, honey. When we get our first payment, you take your 20,000 right away. - That's yours. - Right. Tax-free. - We want you to be happy. - Oh. Well, I could... l could really use the money, 'cause m-m-my church needs a new furnace. - Oh, well, that is so refreshing. - Yeah. And I'm gonna use the rest to open an adult bookstore. Ah. Okay. Well, that's good. That's good too. Yeah. Do you masturbate, Russ? Jeez. I've been so busy lately, I barely polish my shoes. - 'Cause i masturbate all the time. - Oh, yeah? Yeah. Some people think it's a sin, but God gave us the ability to masturbate to protect us from sin. Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. I could... I could see that. - Sure. Why not? - I like sex. - There's a lot of sex in the Bible. - Mm-hmm. - I'm sure there's a Bible here. - Yeah. - Yeah, sure. - S-So, we... - We're a team, right? - Yeah, yeah, a team! - Yeah? - Team. [ Chuckling ] - [ Chuckling ] - Ooh. Yeah? Yeah? - Oh, I've got one. Let me pick. - No, no, no, no, no! - Please, let me finish. Okay, 16. - I wanna pick one. Sixteen, okay?

No, the 25th was my anniversary, and I got divorced, and I got screwed in that. I didn't get a good settlement. Seventy. I had a '70 Camaro and got in that accident and got a huge settlement. - Oh, yeah. Famous whiplash. Okay. - Remember? That's right. Um, I got some randomly selected numbers, okay? [Walter] These are, Iike, completely random. - Okay? - Flick it. Make sure air gets... Twenty-two, seventy. Puncture. Then you inject a little paint into the ball. - You know, weigh them down. - Sixteen. Then weput a little glue over the hole. - Nine. - [Russ] Isn 't this fun? - Twenty-seven. - [Russ] It's like summer camp. It's like arts and crafts. - Seven. - [ Russ ] The six we don't inject. - Those are gonna rise to the top. - It's my birthday. Get it? Okay. Those are the winning numbers.

Good afternoon, Lawrence. Hey, Russ. - I've been thinking about you. - Big news. No, I have. First of all, this is for you. Token of my appreciation for how hard you've been working. And let me tell you something else. People have been talking about you. - What people? - Let's get another thing straight. No one is stealing you away from me, because you are... - What are you? - Number one. - That's right. - Wow, it's quite an honor. - I don't know what to say. - Well, don't say anything. As our Jewish friends say, "Enjoy." Look, Russ, remember i told you about my cousin's stepdad? The one with the roadside fun park in Colorado, in Leadville? Well, if you did, my brain immediately purged it. Well, i gave him a call, and i told him about our situation, and he said he'd buy our whole inventory in one fell swoop. Really? Well, how much? Okay, well, here's where we run into a small asterisk. - Thirty thousand? - Who is this guy, Jesse James? I oughta get in a Santa Claus outfit and give them away. I just thought, you know, if the noose starts getting tighter. "The noose"? Who am i talking to? Is this Larry, the winner? Is this Larry number one? Am i talking to the Larry that everybody's talking about? - Who's talking about me? - Oh, hey. Hey, hey, good. Good idea. - Good morning, sweetie. Hi. - Hi. - So, where is it? - What? The ticket. I'm dying to see it. Well, i have it. Don't worry. I'm not worried. May i see it, please? Well, actually, I might hold on to it for a while. - What does that mean? - Well, first of all, how come I'm only getting $20,000? I mean, I'm taking all the risk, right? - Walter? - And, you know... I'm... I'm the one who's gotta cash it in. What if they find out this was rigged? - No. - W-W-What if th-they... It's like this is a setup or some kind of, like, an ambush. - I could get caught. - That's not gonna happen. No. Shh. Sweetie, listen. You're being really silly. Okay? Now, we made a deal, and you agreed to it. So let's just move forward as planned, okay? No. Why... Why can't we split it three ways? - The weatherman, you, and me. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm doing all the work. - You're lucky to get a little bit. Well, can we... I'm family. Go get the fucking ticket! Now, give me the ticket, you jerk-off! Get off me! You're a whore! - Stop it! - Oh! Do not fuck with me, you sick, masturbating retard! Go ahead and rape me. That's what you want! Shut up! Where's the ticket? - I'm not telling you, slut! - I want that ticket now! - I'm telling your parents! - Stop it! Are you ready for the song "Bingo Was His Name-O"? - [ Children ] Yeah! - All right. There was a farmer had a dog and Bingo was his name-o B-i-n-g-o, B-i-n-g-o - [Walter Gasping] - Where is it? My... My... My... My... My puffer. - Your what? Stop it! What? - Puffer! Puffer! [ Wheezing, Coughing ] My puffer! I can't breathe! - I'll get it. God. - Get it. Thank you. Thank you. Is this what you want, your puffer? Where's the ticket? [ Wheezing ] I'm not telling you. Fine! [ Gasping, Wheezing ] - F-Fucky-you. - [ TV Turns On ] [ Inhaler Clicking, Expelling Mist ] - [ TV ] These days are ours - Walt, look. Happy Days is on. - Happy and free - Those happy days - These daysare ours - Share them with me Good-bye gray skies, Hello blue There's nothing can hold me when I hold you Feels so right, it can't be wrong Rockin' and rollin' all week long The people on the bus go yap-yap-yap Yap-yap-yap, Yap-yap-yap The people on the bus go yap-yap-yap [Man On TV] Laverne De Fazio and Shirley Feeney! - Casablanca. - [Laverne] Casablanca. - Shit! - [Man] Okay. [Screaming, Yelling On TV] Damn it! Come on. Where is it? Oh! Goddamn it! Ugh. [ Sighs ] I'm gonna puke. Oh! Yes. Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Yes! Hey, Walt, met your girlfriend. Cute. [ Voice Breaking ] Yes, I need an ambulance right away. My cousin had some kind of asthma attack. He's not moving. Okay. I can't believe it. I-I'm in shock. I thought he had one of those inhaler things. - His puffer? I couldn't find it. - Yeah. - You couldn't find it? - No, we couldn't find it at first. And then when we did find it, it was all out of shit... of juice. - Mist? - Yeah, mist. It was out of mist. - Mm. Know what his last words were? - What? - "Crystal, my sweet angel." - Don't, don't. "Go into my wallet and take the ticket, 'cause you and Russ deserve to have that money." Oh, God! Oh, fuck me. No fried clams? - Crystal? I know, baby. - Hmm. It's insensitive to bring up something at a time like this, but I think we do have a little problem. What? Well, with Walter gone, we have no one to cash in the ticket. - God rest his soul and everything. - I wouldn't worry about that. - Why? - I've got plenty of relatives. In fact, I'll probably see a lot of them at Walter's funeral. No. You know, l wouldn't bring them into this. - I mean, they've suffered enough. - [Woman] There's Russ Richards! He's more handsome in person! - [ Sniffles ] - It's times like this you wonder. You wonder if there's a higher being out there. - Maybe it was just Walter's time - - All right! Key lime pie. [Rock] - Hello, Jerry, mate. How are you? - Gig. - Wanna hear a cute story? - I would love to hear a cute story. You know i got a grandson, six years old. - That's a great age. - Yeah. [ Chuckles ] He says to me the other day, he says, "Pop-Pop, when i grow up, I wanna be a bookie and run a numbers racket just like you." Ohhh. I know. I melted. And then he asksme, he says, "Pop-Pop, when people play the numbers, what number do they try to win?" So i explain to him. I say, "Sweetie, every week we bookies, we get the number from someplace customers know we can't control." - And he says, "Like Sesame Street?" - Lovely that, isn't it? It's amazing what these kids come up with, isn't it? It's amazing. And i say, "No, no, no, no, not Sesame Street. We get the number from the lottery drawing on television, the last three digits of the real lotto, because everyone knows no one can rig the state lottery, which means no one can rig a bookie's number." - That's right. - And he looks at me. You know, big long look with these big brown eyes, and he says, "And I bet no one can win either!" [ Chuckles ] He's a genius. Kid's a genius. After all, h-how often do I have to pay out? - Once, twice, three times a year. - If. If. So, moving right along. Next day, guess what. I had 12 people hit the same number. - No shit! - Yeah. Which even a six-year-old kid knows, statistically, it's impossible. Out of the realm of possibility. Can't happen. - I don't know what to tell you. - Here's the funny thing, though. When i looked at the people who picked, a pattern started to emerge. - Really? - Yeah. Your ex-wife. [ Laughing ] Your ex-wife. Your ex-wife's mother. Her mother's sister. Your dentist. Your cousin Vic. A few other stray crinkly leaves from the family tree. They all played variations on the same number. - You know, Jerry. - Hmm. If it wasn't for the fact that we are dear friends - - We are dear friends, right? - Dear friends. I would suspect that you are accusing me of something. Of what? I mean, Jesus Christ himself can't rig the state lottery. Thank you. Unless - Unless Jesus had a buddy down at the TV station. - Ahh. - Ahh. - Ahh. - Ahh. Nah. [ Chuckles ] A real stumper, huh? - Yeah, a fucking head scratcher. - A fucking head scratcher. Fucking head scratcher, mate. You know, I got some pals down at the D.A.'s office. Always looking for a good head scratcher. Now, Jerry, you never told me you had a grandson. I don't. [Laughing] Hello, Dale, love. How are you? - What you gonna do tonight, Kippy? - Gonna watch Sports Center. You're gonna watch Sports Center, and you're gonna see if Winchell is still out with the knee thing. [Jerry] And if he's still out with the knee thing, we gotta change the spread on Detroit, right? - Right. - So what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna watch Sports Center. - Go home. Watch it. Go. Tonight. - Good night. - [Car Door Slams, Engine Starts] - Oh, beautiful. Lovely. Flat tire. - Oh, the shark has such teeth - Kippy?

[ Announcer ] And the sixth. - Twenty-seven! - Ooh, twenty-seven. What the hellis she up to? You're not smart enough to pull a thing like this off. Balls are just laying there. Hey. - [ Chuckling ] How are you? - Hey! Hey, you're that, uh - you're the, uh - - Weatherman. - Oh, shit! - Hey, I watch you every night! - Yeah? Thank you. - Let me give you a hand with that. - No, it's okay. - I insist! - I can carry my own groceries. Wow, man! It must be great having a job like yours, no? Well, it, uh, it pays the bills. Nah, you guys just read a bunch of crap from cards, right? Cold in the east, a storm right. It looks like rain. Aah! It's more complicated than that. Let me askyou - I'm trying to plan my birthday in a couple of months. Can you tell me if it's going to be a nice day? Oh, right, hey, nice meeting you. Always great to know a fan. Your name was? - Dale. - Dale. - Yeah. - The thug? So, Russ, i just want to apologize about the last time we spoke. I wasn't really feeling good. I was feeling sort of vulnerable. I had fear issues come up, being arrested and all. - Oh, yeah. - Plus, I was drinking, which I'm really not supposed to do, you know, on the medication. - Oh, I see. - Can I have some of these? - Yeah, go ahead. - You know, it wasn't a good moment. I just wanted to make an amends. Hey, listen, don't you worry. The truth is, l should be apologizing to you. I was gonna call about the $10,000, but the station got so busy. Don't worry about the ten grand, Russell. - It's water under the bridge. - Really? Wow! I didn't know that. All right then. Okay, let's celebrate. Yeah, because the new number i have in mind is about half a mil. [Spits] [ Clears Throat ] Come here, Russ. - I rather not. - Russ, come sit down. - No, no. - Russ, sit the fuck down! Okay. Unfortunately, Russell, we have a new wrinkle in the situation. Oh, really? What's the wrinkle? Basically I had to play pinata with Jerry the bookie's skull. - That ups the invoice a little. - Is he okay? - No, he's dead. - Oh! Oh, God. You know, okay. I'm really uncomfortable with this kind of conversation. You know, not to mention, I broke my 1986 World Series commemorative bat. - Oh, yeah? - It was a gift from my mother. She's gettin' a little old, and she's not feeling good these days. - Hasn't left the house in 6 weeks. - Okay, just give me - You killed Jerry the bookie with a bat? It's not like a half mil is gonna hurt you with that lottery ticket. - Get me the money, Russ. - Ohh! Great, Gig. We gotta talk about this. I'll fuckin' ball-bat you, you creep cock sucker. Okay, okay. Okay. [ Coughing ] - Mint Listerine? - Yeah. - When did they come out with this? - I don't know. - Is it good? - Yeah, it's good. [ Tires Screeching ] Look, just give this Dale guy a little extra money. - It's better than losing it all. - Better than being dead too. Crystal, he hits people with commemorative bats! He's not gonna hit you with a bat. He's your friend. - What? - Wanna see the jacket i got? He's not my friend. I just met this guy. How can he be my f - - Look - $900. - [Sighs] Made in Italy. I'm not screwing around anymore. If it wasn't on a boat, l don't want it. Stop buying things from Italy. You are not a millionaire. We - We are not millionaires. The first thing we gotta do is find a reliable, non-asthmatic person... to cash in this ticket A.S.A.P., or we're dead. Funny you should mention that. - I think I have another candidate. - Oh, yeah? Who? This guy that I was seeing when l was waitressing at the racetrack. I think he still works there too. A real sweet guy. Bought me a really expensive parrot, too, from Brazil or something. My cat bit its head off. You hated that fucking bird, didn't you, sweetie? The racetrack, eh. Well, actually, he's an unofficial employee. He injects horses with some shit that makes them run faster. Forget it. Cross him offthe list. Forget him. Who else? There is Scatter, the guy who installed my carpet. - I went to high school with him. - The man's name is Scatter? Yeah, well, he's a total coke freak, which could work in our favor because he usually needs money. No, junkies are problematic. Let's keep thinking. Mm-hmm. - Wanna have sex? - Oh, yeah. You know, i... I wasjust feeling good that day. Yeah. I, uh... I don't know what to say. I'm at a loss, boy. I'm at a total loss. I mean, here you are, supposedly injured, all right? You're collecting your lieutenant's salary and full disability. I didn't even want to do this. Matt had to talk me into it. You know how stupid I felt? The lower back, it's an enigma. Pat, I'm gonna be straight with you. Obviously I have alternatives to pursue, but I'm not gonna... because - cause I don't want this getting out. All right? It makes everybody look bad. But from now on, you are back on full patrol. Here. Get started with this. - A missing person's case? - Yeah, a bookie. Jerry Green. No one's seen him for about a week. Huh. Jeez. - What happened to him? - I don't know, Pat. That's what you're supposed to find out. Right. All right. We talked earlier about the fact there's a shortage of wading pools. Dick? Judy said you wanted to see me. Oh, hey, sport. Have a seat. Be right with you. - [Chuckling] - Is that Chuck Rhodes? This guy kills me. - I found Crystal too. - Hiya, kid. Judy, close the door. - Okay. - Thanks. - What's going on? - [Laughing] [TV. Off] - So, Russ, how's the finances? - What? - What? - The finances. - W-- Great. - Good. - You seemed in a bind last time. - Well, that was then. Terrific. And how are you, honey? We haven't talked in a while. - Did you know May left me? - Jeez, I'm so sorry about that. - Life's tough. - And how. - But you seem to be doing well. - I'm great. - But you seem to be doing well. - I'm great. Why wouldn't you be great, with a friend like Russ here? - Yeah. Look at that, huh? - Oh, jeez. Oh, boy. How about that? Don't say a word, not one. Cause if i hear one comment like, "What are you talking about?"... - I'm gonna call the cops. - What? Wh-What do you mean? It slipped out. We're listening. Go ahead. I chewed on it for three days, and I'm convinced I have evidence to fuck you both up big time. Bull. You don't have any evidence. What is that? - Stop it. Shut up. You shut up. - You shut up. Shut up! No. That's bullshit. Dick, you have the floor. You have the floor. - Go ahead. - Short and sweet. I want half the money, or i'll have you arrested, and might even do it on the air, live. - Imagine the ratings. - I'd like to see you try, asshole. - You're gonna see me. - I'll kill you, I swear to God! - I'm gonna kill you! - You treacherous little bitch! You got one week to get your shit together. - You listening? I want the money. - [Door Slams] Okay. Okay. Okay, let's do a little math. You want 20 percent, Dale wants half a million, and Dick wants half of everything. I don't have a calculator, but it seems I'm in debt again! Dale's money comes out of your share. He's your friend. - Not my friend. He's his friend. - I hardly know the man. Who cares? It's all fucking moot now. The only thing that's moot to me is the Dick Simmons issue. You get a toothache, you pull the tooth. What does that mean? - Let's kill the son of a bitch. - Oh, God! - [Crystal] Yes! - No! One call to Dale, we're back on track. Absolutely! Let's do it. What is wrong with you? He threatened us. Just remember that. - It is extortion. - Does that mean he's gotta be dead? - We're not giving him our money. - What money? That worthless scrap of shit? Yeah, okay. Maybe it's time for your friend, the drug-addicted carpet installer. - Oh, Scatter. - Scatter! Yeah! He could help. This is killing me. I have slept five hours this whole week. - Oh, God, here we go. - I have dandruff with big flakes. I've gained two pounds! Listen to my voice. I'm losing my instrument. Shouting isn't helping. - [Woman] Hey, Gig? - Yeah? There's a couple of cops in the club asking for you. - I'll be right in. - Oh, great! Cops in the club. I've always wanted to give an inmate fame. They kill the celebrities first, and then they fuck 'em in the butt. Will you just relax, please? There are cops always in this club. They're probably just arranging an engagement party or something. -Just hold on a tick. - Yeah. [Stereo] Toe to toe Dancing very close -Body breathing - [Gig] Goodevening, Officers. - What can I do for you? - Are you the owner? Yes, I am. Gig. Gig, do you know a guy by the name of Jerry Green? He apparently is known to come in here. Yeah, Jerry the bookie. Comes in here all the time. Has he been in here lately, because, I mean, nobody's seen this guy around for a while. Ah... about a week ago, I think. Huh. Back to back Sacroiliac Spine less movement - And a wild attack - You wanna get back to this? - Maybe ask another question or two? - Yeah, yeah. Where... do you find girls like that? I mean, who'd do that kind of stuff? Well, you know, it's remarkably easy. You'd be surprised. These two, I believe, we imported from upstate New York. I was gonna say, they seem like... Albany girls. Uh, so, anyway, we just wanted to drop by... and find out if you've seen this guy. Well, I'll let you know. Although, with Jerry, he could be shacked up anywhere. He's a bookie, for Christ's sake. It was nothing. Nothing. The word "lotto" never even came up. - See, Mr. Crazy Man? - Thank God! - They were checking on Jerry. - They asked about Jerry? - Yeah, yeah. It was just routine. - Not routine. It's called a murder investigation. No, trust me. Dale took care of every thing. They'll find a cure for cancer before they find Jerry. [MaleAnnouncer] Live from Harrisburg and News Center Six. Covering Harrisburg, New York, Lancaster and Lebanon, it's News at Five with Dan Shuff, Heidi Zimmer... and Russ Richards with the weather. This is News at Five. Our top story tonight: The body of a local bookmaker was found floating in the river today. Police say it was foul play and are following leads. More on that story in a moment. First, let's check in with the weather center... to see if we can expect more of these spring-like temperatures. Russ? Russ? Oh, yeah? - How about these temperatures? - What? The uncommonly warm weather - will it continue? - Russ? - Russ? Uh, um, wh-what was that question? Thanks, Russ. Well, it seems like we can keep those thermal socks in the closet... for the time being then. That's right, Dan. Police are calling it... the crudest attempt to dispose of a body in recent memory. Jerry Green of Linglestown... was apparently bludgeoned to death... and then dropped into the river with a brick taped to one wrist. This was insufficient weight to keep the corpse submerged. [ Sighs ] What time did they pull this bookie out ofthe river? Scotty told me around 6:00. Ted told me 8:00. It's like a fucking guessing game. They pulled him at 6:00 and bagged him at 8:00. Was he nude? Somebody said he had a T-shirt on. Why don't you get off your ass and check the reports, man? I'm going with nude. I'm so glad this thing is finally over. What does that mean? We don't have to look for this guy anymore. Gee, wouldn 't it be great if we found out who killed him? I realize that entails more work, but I'm just thinkin' out loud. Has it ever occurred to you, Chambers, that he was drunk... and he just slipped off the bridge? Hmm? A little thing called an accident. Why is everybody around here so foul-play happy? The man was bludgeoned to death, Lakewood! His skull was bashed in, he had a plastic bag over his head... and duct tape around his neck. Keep going. [Man On TV] You're in a very small, select group of guys. What is it that makes you successful... and all the others knocking on the doors not so successful? [Man #2] I'm not so sure. As i travel, i see television guys who would make good game show hosts. - But i don't tell 'em. - [Laughter] To me, a game show host is the icing on the cake. But the format is the cake. No one - [Man Talking] I'll love you till the day i die. Yes! And again. [Man] At 2.15 that afternoon, Johnny Clay - [TV Continues, Faint] - He's expecting me. - Come in. I don't know why I did it. It all unraveled and then one thing happened after another. Jesus. I'm still in shock, boss. I'm in so much trouble, Larry. No man becomes wise without stepping on the soil of fools. Right. Right! But I never claimed to be a - That's good. Where did you get that? Is that from the Bible? It's from this play I wrote in eighth grade about Evel Knievel. - Oh. - What are you gonna do? Well, I have a plan, i do. But I need money. I need it fast. I was thinking about that guy who wanted the snowmobiles. - Yeah. - You think he's still interested? Yeah, I think so, but you'd have to find some way to deliver 'em. Set it up. Set... it... up. - [ Dick ] $100,000? - That's right. You wanna sell me a lotto ticket worth $6.4 million for $100,000? Correct. I want out. However, this is a one-time-only offer, Dick. I want the money, l want it tonight at the station. If I hear any excuses, any bullshit like, "I can only get part of it"... or "I need more time," the deal is off. - Be reasonable. It'll take days - - Deal's off. - I'll get it, I'll get it. - Good decision. [ Russ ] Now, I believe that i have solved all of our problems. [ Crystal ] What century is this guy in? Put a motor on it, Jake! A year and a half behind this freak. One, I found a buyer for the snowmobiles, a guy in Colorado. I'm renting a trailer, and i'm gonna deliver them myself. - But why Colorado? - But, uh, uh! Number two: the lotto ticket. I sold it to Dick. - Hundred grand. It's his problem. - I don't think so. Numberthree, which is probably the most important of all, I'm leaving tonight for good. Now, questions? [ Tires Screech ] You fucked up the whole thing! You screwed it all up! - Stop it! - You brain-damaged fool! God, and i picked out a car and everything! Hey, now listen. If I didn't do this, we'd be in jail or at the river bottom... - with bricks taped to our wrists. - [ Groans ] - And you know it. - Oh, my God. You're so stupid. - Oh! - Oh, Crystal. - We are under surveillance. - Oh, yeah? Yes. Last night I stopped by a convenience store. A cop pulled in behind me, he got out, he followed me in... and then he pretended to get a cup of coffee! Did he pretend to get a doughnut? - Oh, you know-- - You are nuts! - You need to see a psychiatrist. - Oh, I'm nuts? - You can't handle this! - What about this little puppy? There's enough mist in this thing to save ten masturbators! [Rock] Ain 't no big thing to wait - - That's an ugly turn of events. - Mm-hmm. - Mmm! What is this? - [Continues, Faint] Schnapps? What, am i in third grade? - Can i have a drink, please? - Let's talk this through, shall we? You're saying that Russ, in his infinite wisdom, - Yeah. - sold the ticket for a 100 grand. Can you believe it? A $6 million ticket! - I've got more brains in my... shoe! - [Glass Shatters] Russ never really had the stomach for this sort of thing, did he? I do, and I want that ticket back, and I want Dick Simmons dead! Do you hear me? Fine. Fine. Speed dial. I love it. And I want his head cut off so i can hang it from my rear view mirror! - That's just your anger talking. - Yeah. Dale. Dale, it's Gig. - His machine. - Oh. Um, see, things have got a little bit sticky over here. Slight change of plans, nothing that your deft touch couldn't rectify. So either swing by or call back. That'd be marvelous. - Thank you. - Great. - Slight snag though. - What? Well, Dale - blesshim - has been doing favor after favor for us. If it's not one thing, it's the other. So - - So what's your point? - [ Sighs ] If he's gets the ticket back for us, we'll have to give him more money. - No. No way. NO. - That would only be fair. There is a limit to my classiness. - Quite obviously. - Shut up! I'll handle this. You just leave Dale out of it. Bunch of morons. I have to do everything myself! - Hi. - Well, well, well. Look who it is. An old face from the past. What's on your mind, gorgeous? - Oh, just wanted to say hello. - Really? That's sweet. 'Cause the last time we chatted, l believe you threatened to kill me. Gee, has something changed since then? You really did out smart us, didn't you? Screwed us royally. - I'm impressed, Dick. - I'm like a lion that way. I hide in the weeds, bide my time, then i jump out and tear the ass off some dumb buffalo. Ooh. So, Mr. Lion, how are you gonna cash in that ticket? I'll think of something. Don't lose any sleep over it. Believe me, honey, i sleep like a baby, 'cause the second you try to cash in that little fucker, I'm going to the lottery commission and tell them everything. If you did that, I'd rat you out quicker than a frog can take a piss. Mmm. - What do you want? - Halfsies. Half. Have you been exercising? 'Cause you look great. Deal. Nothing like rekindling an old friendship. Hey, that's him. Wagstaff. - Wagstaff? - Yes, Wagstaff. Are you sure? Light hair, 6'2' lives here. You need anything else? - Does he have a record? - You should read the report. Wagstaff was overheard bragging about the bookie's murder in a bar. Oh, what a jerk. You know what would be unfortunate? If we got into that whole let's-follow-him rigmarole. - [Tires Screeching] - Oh, perfect. [ Grunting ] Oh, man! It's getting cold out, huh? I never realized how heavy these were. K.C. inducted engines, twin carbs. Just touch that throttle and boom! It's like gettin' a chick off. - That wasn't your sales pitch. - Oh, yeah. You actually said that to people? Well, you know, just, like, biker types. Huh. Hey, Russ. Checkit out. I don't believe it. I thought you called for partly cloudy and pleasant tonight. A backdoor cold front. - A what? - A backdoor cold front. Rare. Almost impossible to predict. The atmosphere - a beautiful yet fickle beast she is. Is that from the Evel Knievel play? Yup. [ Sighs ] [ Engine Backfires ] [Backfires] [Chambers] Where in the hell is he going? Beats me. He's definitely up to something. Definitely. We should call for backup. You know, it never hurts. You know, backup, it's like an old friend. It's like an old sweatshirt you slip into on a cold night. Are you listening, Chambers? Get your head out of the clouds! - Hey. - [ Moans ] Hey, wake up. Come on. Wake up. - Fuck it. - [ Crystal Screams ] - What? - Wake the fuck up! - What is this? - What do you want? - You know what I want. - My wallet. Take the $50 out. And don't hurt me! I'm just sleeping over. - Where's the ticket? - What ticket? - Gig sent you? - The tooth fairy sent me, Twiggy. - Who do you think? - Hey, please leave. Don't fuckin' play games with me. I'm hopped up on wine coolers and antidepressants. I don't feel good. - Where is it? - I don't know. - You don't know? - No, I don't know. - Do you like baseball? - What? - Do you like baseball? - Yes. - Who's your favorite player? - Ted Williams. Ted Williams. He had some swing. It was sort of like this. [ Both Screaming ] No, hey, hey. Hold on. Just take it easy. I'm gonna call for backup. - I'm gonna go around the back. - No, you're in cowboy mode. Stop that! Wait for backup. Oh, shit. Shit. Shit! - We speaking the same language? - I'm gonna give him the ticket. It's not worth it. Life's too precious. Good girl. That's all i ask for, a little cooperation. - Here's cooperation, you shit! - Aaah! Ooh! - Oh! - Aah! Aah. - [Door Slams] - Police! Freeze! Don't shoot! No, no! There's a raving crazy guy up there! Just go kill him. Aah! Ohh! Lakewood, I'm hit! - Huh? Say what? - Don't let him through! Aah! [Crystal] Somebody! Get me a fucking robe! - Isn 't it ironic? - Yeah, ironic. Just another word for saying You're getting screwed. But so what, right? It's all over now anyway. In a while, bim-bam-boom, I've got this town in the rearview mirror. - Hey, take me with you, boss. - What? - Yeah, a little Colorado road trip. - No, no, Larry. Come on. Let me go.

Positive attitude - that's everything. Hey, pal, he got shot in the leg. I think he'll be fine. Let's hope so. Be careful with him! [ Larry ] What are you doing?

Nobody's beating me. You get out of here. I don't want you mixed up in this. - If i go to jail, I'm goin' alone. - Wait! Your money's in your briefcase! Don't do it! Don't take that sled.

You're in big trouble, mister. - No. Oh, God. - Yup. - You're gonna have to pay for it. - I told them, Officer. I said it was stupid at the start, but nobody listened to me. That's good. Remorse. Nice candy. 'Cause, for starters, we're looking at three big ones. Oh, God! Three big - Three years? Three hundred dollars. What? For the windshield. Plus, there's this little baby right here. You'll have to put that together with tape, but it still counts. - This-- This is a ticket. - Yeah. For operating a class-two vehicle without a license. Weight class two. Can't this wait? Mr. Richards is suffering from a concussion. - We're talking. - There's nothin' on it. My pen ran out of ink. Officer, i really must insist.

Where's the ticket? It's my show - This is the plan. I'm docking you for being an asshole. And I'm docking Gig for having people killed. And I'm docking Crystal for being a twisted, psycho bitch! Starting today, i decide where the money goes. If anyone doesn't like it, we're all going to jail. - [ Gasps ] - You give me that ticket. Where is it? Where is the ticket? I.. I gave it to Larry King. Uh, no... Got to learn to share your toys! [Dan] The search is over. The winneroflast month's $6.4 million lottery jackpot... has finally stepped forward. She's a waitress at a local Denny's right here in Harrisburg. Pennsylvania's newest multimillionaire is Wendy Fawcett. Thankyou so much! I don't know what to say. I've never won anything before in my life. [ Woman ] Wendy, what are you gonna do with the money? I'm going to put some in savings and some of it in checking. And the rest I'll be sharing with a good friend. - And who's that? - I'm not telling you! [ Cackling ] And we're giving a lot of it away to the Big Brothers, the Sunshiny Day Club, Asthma... - [Man] Do you have asthma? - No. But many people out there do. Wendy, how did you pick the numbers you played? - How did I what? - How did you choose the numbers? Oh, I get what you're saying. Okay, I get it, I get it! Um, wow. Uh, let's see, uh, seventy... seventy is because... a cheeseburger deluxe with bacon... is 70 cents extra. And, um, 16... When I was 16, I went to a party. And, uh, nine... Well, nine, we all know, is just lucky. Oh, man. And, um, seven is... I have seven Barbies, not including the ones that got their face chewed off... by the next door neighbor's dog, who's just such a great dog. [Russ Narrating] There it is-- a story to tell your grandchildren. Well, maybe not. Dick Simmons was fired from WTPA... after calling the network head "the luckiest asshole on Earth." He now teaches communications at Pocono Community College. Ethics. Crystal married and divorced a sickly 80-year-old millionaire... and sued him for half his money. She testified he was a Svengali, a word she mispronounced throughout the trial. He was like... like this "Svenjelly". [Russ] She lost the case. You're making my dreams come true She works at Gig's five nights a week. No cover charge, free buffalo wings with coupon. Thirty-nine! Gig bought an obscure stock called Microsoft in 1990. He now divides his time between Harrisburg and his estate in Monaco. Listen to this I've done all my daydreaming Oh, that sleep walk should be over by now As for me, i moved to St. Augustine, Florida, where it hasn't snowed in 50 years. - [ Engine Starts ] - And you know what? I auditioned, and i was back on TV. [Male Announcer] And now it's time top lay north Florida cable's... second-most popular game show, Lucky Numbers, with your host, Russ Richards. - Hey!

Dinner for 250? Okay. I'll make the margaritas. All right, now... [Narrating] You know, sometimes i walk past an appliance store... with 45 TV sets in the window, and i'm on everyone of them. At times like that, i say to myself, "Why me?" I mean, "Why me?" If i had to answe rthe question, i'd have to say, "Just Iucky." You're making my dreams come true Doo-ooh, doo-doo, doo-doo Nights were warm Dreams were easy No one standing Overhead Conversation Didn't mean much We were hungry but we could not be fed Radio blasting Silly little Iove songs We only listened for the beat Taking our chances Out there on the mean streets Hiding in the shadows from the heat From the heat We weren't lovers Just brave strangers As we fought and we tumbled through the night We were players Not arrangers And we jammed till the dawn's early light Swimming in the big lake Taking it easy Taking any comfort we could find Didn't need the real truth Didn't need the meaning Straight ahead ignoring every sign Every sign And, oh, i remember I know you do too Oh, that one evening I know you do too The moon flying high [Chorus] The moon flying high - And you took my hand - Ooh Ooh-ooh You took my hand Ooh-ooh And it went allright It went allright It went allright It went allright Oh So we walked out Hardly speaking Disappearing In the night Saw each other A few time safter But we never really got it right We weren't lovers Just brave strangers As we rolled and we tumbled through the night We were players Not arrangers And we jammed till the dawn's early light - Just brave strangers - Early light - Just brave strangers - Whoa-oh Whoa-oh Whoa-oh Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh Yeah [Woman] I can't wait to go to heaven Before i get my big reward If i'm good i could That's what they tell me i've been working for When i prove that i can do it That's when i'll get my big reward Keep that big wheel turning And my number will come up for sure I'm gonna get my big reward Wanna get my big reward Wanna have it all sewn up Before I'm all grown up Gonna get my big reward Gonna get my big reward Gonna get my big reward Right now Nevermind the odds against us I won't give up mybig reward We have to take our chances We got a plan and we can make a score I'm gonna get my big reward Wanna get my big reward Wanna have it all sewn up Before i'm all grown up Gonna get my big reward Gonna get my big reward Right now
