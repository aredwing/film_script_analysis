You go and try to make it back to The Room. Wish me luck, brother. It doesn't seem to be serious. Just passed out from alcohol. - Anyone been able to ID the guy? - Nothing yet, Officer. We'll get him cleaned up a little. I gotta go. - Paul, I need you in here now. - Right away. What've we got? 32-year-old cop, multi-gunshots. Right chest and leg. - Vitals in the field? - Stable. Type of weapon? Ask him. He shot him. Multi-shots also. A crack pipe was in his pocket. Let's get lines, pressure and fluid back here, please. I need two teams. Simon, he's yours. Martin, Christina, over here. I need you out of here now. Do us a favor. Father, you're too early, as ever. Get him stable and upstairs. Jodie? Call the ORs. I want two rooms in about three minutes. Hi, how you doing? My name's Dr. Luthan. I'm the doctor in charge. You've been shot but you're doing fine. Mind if I look? Let's take a little look. It's not so bad. Do me a favor. Take a deep breath when I say, "Now". Jodie in Trauma. We've got two patients with gunshots. We need two ORs. Deep breath. Great. No breath sounds on the right. Get a chest tube... ...and rays here. Stat, Paula, stat. - Got a name? Talk to me. - Simon, how're we doing? - A shot in the neck, one in the arm... - And the wild look in your eye. Let's relax. Same goes for everyone. Including you. You've been doing crack? Who the fuck are you? You been doing heroin? I need to know if I'm gonna help you. I'll look at your arm. Get a combine and pressure on that. - How're we upstairs? - Nothing yet. Of course not. Stupid of me. That's it. Right through there. One room up. OR 3 standing by. That's no good. I need two rooms. Two patients need two rooms. Motherfucker shot me. He fucking shot me! But you shot him first, didn't you? Calm down. Help us out. We're getting a urine sample. Are we in? We're in. - Good. Joel, do we have x-rays? - Nothing yet. - Where's Paula? - Don't know. Gentlemen, please? Thanks. Doc, you remember me, right? How's my guy? Obviously he's been shot, so... Excuse me. He's got a family. - Good. Point taken. Thank you. - This is his wife. Your husband will be okay. He'll be fine. Thank you. Talk to you later. The other guy, go easy on the painkillers, will you? X- rays are good. Let's get them both upstairs. I can't shake another room. They've just gotta open one, that's all. They just did. They're full. What's the move? We got an expanding hematoma. Pressure's dropping. Joel? BP's stable but we already lost a liter through the chest tube. Take the cop. Whole team goes with him. This team stays with me. Here, Daniel, you're gonna need this. Jodie, tell them he's coming. I need a basic tray set-up, sterile gloves. I need to get him intubated and I need light on this subject. I wanted to thank you. You did a great thing for my guy. Listen, it's... No, not you. This is one hell of a doctor, I tell you. She knows, she knows. Good. Thank you very much then. Thank you. Tara, can you get Mrs. Gomez up to the pulmonary unit? Excuse me. - You need anything, call me. - Will do. - I owe you one. - Sure. Anytime. Name's Stone, as in Sharon. Listen, they only gave me one room. Yes, I know. But you knew the other guy was in much worse shape. - They'll both make it. - You didn't know that. I did. Look, you made a moral choice, not a medical one. I guess I'm just... - I'm surprised, that's all. - Hang on. Wait. This is New York. Gunshot wounds aren't entirely unfamiliar to me. My opinion was that they were both stable. I wanted two ORs, I didn't get them. I had to choose. On my right, I see a cop with his wife in the hallway, and pictures of his kids. On my left, a guy who pulled a gun on a city bus. I had ten seconds to make a choice. I had to make it. I hope I did the right thing. I think I did. Oh, shit. Maybe I didn't, I don't know. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm just... It's okay, it's okay. You may well be right and I appreciate it. I will resign first thing in the morning. That's fair. Good night. Look, Jodie? Are you doing second shift tomorrow? Yeah, why? Well, it's just I have to... ...get these intern evaluations done. I'm supposed to get a nurse's input and I was wondering if maybe I could... ...get yours. - Mine? I was just thinking, your critical faculties seem quite... ...sharp. I'm sorry I got upset. This week has been bad. I know it's been bad. In fact... ...you're too busy. It's ridiculous. I'll do it. It's fine. I'll do it. Thanks. Great. Bobby, please go away. I've got 16 patients out there. I gave you a prescription for pain meds yesterday. I lost it. I got mugged. How many times you get mugged a week? Come on. I need some damn medication. No, take the vitamins I gave you. Try to exercise occasionally. Sorry, but my membership to the tennis club just expired. Should I do dips on the turnstiles in the subway? You're not sick, so I can't give you a prescription. Okay? Give us a break. Okay, sure. I can respect that. - Appreciate it. - Guy! I need a consult. Urgent. Excuse me, Doc. Are you an American? Can I talk to you? Yo, bro! Where was your ass at when I got mugged the other night? They picked him up passed out on Third. Off the bus, he looked okay. They left him ten minutes. Hi there. Jeez, he's really hot. - What's this stuff? - It's what he came in. - Do we have a name for him? - He won't talk. Can you tell me your name, sir? We started to work him up. He looked sour. We only left him ten minutes. Can you tell me your name, sir? Jesus! Hands, please! Get him in the back room. Oxygen. Joel, 10 of Valium. You'll have to calm down for me. Calm down. Simon, how's my EKG? I need some numbers. Any second. - Valium's in. - Hold the oxygen. We're getting him. Can you hear me? If you can hear me, it's very important... Okay, Foley. How's my Foley? We're already in. Let's get a tox and let's get labs. I want an ABG, I want a VDRL... ...I want a CBC, I want a... Just get some serology tubes. We'll work out what we want. Can you run the bloods? Look at this. On his wrist. All right, so we've got a hospital wristband. Hold him. Hold him! No name, no hospital. Anyone seen one of these? Silver. Pressure's 90 over palp and dropping. Where's it going? He could be septic. Look at this. He's post-op. Recent surgical scarring, fresh tracks. Possible IV, possible intravenous drug user. Simon, how's it going? 180, 60, 120... Fix the machine, for chrissake! - Here's what I want. - 70 over palp, Guy. Jesus, okay. Turn up the fluids. Dopamine. Run at 500, now. It's 240, 120. It's not the equipment. I'm getting good tracings here. Get the samples to the lab. The tests you wanted... I don't care. Get everything! Go! Now it's going up, 180 over 100. 180? Back off on the... Don't do that! Back off on the fluids. - Cut the dopamine. We overshot here. - The dopamine's not even in yet. Come on guys, help me. Theories. - What's happening? - I don't know. We're stabilizing. I'm getting a normal sinus rhythm. 120 over 80. - Did we do anything? - It's holding. 80 and steady. Think it's viral? I hope not. Could be. Maybe there's a virologist hiding here somewhere? Hi. Can you hear me? My name... ...Claude Minkins. Good. Listen to me, Claude. You're in Gramercy Hospital. I've been here before. You know what? You had a hospital band on your wrist. Where were you being treated? You taking any drugs? What medicine did they give you? I don't know. Triphase. Whatever they put in you... And what is Triphase? What is that? Is it what they gave you where you were? Tell Izzy I need a psych consult. Then call the pharmacy, find out what Triphase is. Do you have epilepsy? Stay with me. Do you have epilepsy? Diabetes? Asthma? I'm trying to help you, but you have to answer my questions. - Who gave you this Triphase? - Teddy Dolson. He saved my life. The two of us. Okay. But I need to... You go to The Room. You ask Teddy Dolson. He can tell you. You go to The Room. But listen, I'll go to The Room. I'll talk to Teddy Dolson, but at this moment... Help me. Please. He's talking? I'll help you. I just don't want to give you something to make you worse. - Steady, steady. - Hold him down! Hands! Valium. Hit him with another 20. Go. They're on the line. Jason, have you got him? Got it. I've got a patient who says he's on Triphase. Did you ever hear of it? No, no. Triphase with a "T". Could it be a street name or something like that? Start CPR. I need a milligram of epinephrine now! What'd you put on the death certificate? Unknown. Next of kin? No. We don't have anything. We'll let the medical examiner worry about it. Jeff, did you ever hear of something called Triphase? No. What is it? It's this thing he said. Why won't this new system accept my security code? I know I'm not supposed to say this, but I could've screwed up somewhere. Right. You shouldn't be saying it. Maybe we should have someone look it over. Why? Because I've never seen anything like this in my life. Maybe we should check it's not something new. What's new? He's homeless, cold, stoned on God knows what, he dies. It's more than that. You had to see it. I've been here 800 years, Guy. Believe me... ...I've seen it. You look like shit, my friend. Get some rest. By the way, I heard about the NYU thing. Congratulations. Hi, Guy. It's me... ...ringing to congratulate you. What do I have to do to catch up? I'd like some of my money back, please. Give me a ring. We're all very excited. Dad keeps reading the paper. Anyway, call me back. And can you tell me what neurology is? I don't know and I've got people asking me about it. Don't know why. Anyway... ...give me a ring sometime, yeah? I'm back in London. Talk to you then. Soon. 'Bye. Watching a rat running on a treadmill might not be... ...everyone's idea of fun. But to some American and Swedish scientists... ...it's justification for breaking out the champagne. We were watching that. Do me a favor. Get your grandpa. After years of research... Okay, listen up, everyone! Listen up! Thank you. As the only braggart in this family, I won't let you leave this house... ...without hearing this telegram. Stay where you are, Dad. It's from the White House. "We were delighted you were awarded the Wainwright Medal. " "To have worked so long, so brilliantly, with so little regard... ...for personal gain makes you a credit not only... ...to neurological medicine, but also to your country. Many congratulations. " "P.S. Any chance of a contribution to my re-election campaign? I'm desperate. " You heard of this? ...nine hours after the separation of the dorsal cortex... ...there was a significant, if temporary... ...recovery in voluntary mobility. - Extraordinary. - Scientists remain cautious. The world's rat population will be overjoyed. Where's those darn cartoons? This is so nice of you. I got you a baklava. Thank you. - Ready for some coffee? - Sure. Jimmy, can I have another coffee? Jesus, how many have you gotta do? How many have you done? I've done three. When are they due? - Cassmore will be a pretty good doctor. - Great. Exactly. That's exactly what I had. Thank you. Berringer. I think he'll be a shockingly bad doctor. - Isn't that a bit harsh? - No. You're right. He's lethal. I'll give him "fair". I don't wanna go any lower than that. And Myzerra? - The nurses like him. - He's good, isn't he? I don't know about good, but he's extremely sexy. Right. He was on "good". Now, sadly, he's on "unsatisfactory". FBI? Agent Hare. What can I do for you? First of all, this has to be on the q. t. - Is that something you can handle? - Sure. No problem. You seen this gentleman around? His name is Teddy Dolson. I don't know. I mean, take a look. I could put the picture up. Ask around. See if anybody's seen him. That could be damaging. Mind if I look around? Sure. Whatever you say. How do you know this? I can't even put faces to half these names. I don't know. I talk to people, I suppose. Plus, I see their files. You what? Rostering. It's okay. Have you seen mine? You just got your fellowship at NYU. In two months you won't talk to any of us. Yeah, dead right on both counts. Anything else? Your dad's a doctor. Right. "Was", actually. He retired. And your family? Are they medical? Not really. A lot of hypochondriacs, but that's not quite the same. Did the file say my dad had his license revoked? I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot. No, that's fine. I'm sorry. I'll put you out of your misery. He... Well, that is exactly what he did, in fact. For a very old friend in a lot of pain with terminal lymph cancer. Where do you stand on that one? I don't know. Nor do I. - Can I get you another baklava? - No, thank you. Sorry. Maybe next time we can go somewhere with better food. That would be anywhere in New York. Yes, it would. We should probably go, right? Yeah, absolutely. Listen, you go. I'll clear all this up. Thanks for doing this. Thank you for the coffee. - Right. Coffee. - See you there. - Jimmy, can I get the check? - Sure. Thanks. Sorry. Hang on. Got it. There you go. Who the hell is Claude Minkins? It's "was", I'm afraid. He died. Tell me he had insurance. That's not at all likely. This is $2,600 worth of lab work. Right. Can I... I had two people tied up for eight hours. What you do in your own home is your business. Let's get it into your head. This is not England, or the Royal Shakespeare... ...Taxpayer-Pick-Up-The-Tab Health Care System. Somebody has to pay for this shit. Sorry. He's got liver damage, but no hepatitis. He's HIV-negative... ...but look at his T cell count. - He's negative viral and bacterial... - What is that? I don't know. She probably just got her bill. Please help. Does this make sense to you? Take a look. If I tell you what I think, will you take the screamer? Very sick dude. Very funny labs. Catch you later. I do. I'm sorry. I realize it is very late. I apologize. Could you just answer me one thing? Does your hospital use a silver-colored bracelet? Okay, terrific. You don't know any hospital or anything that does use something like that? Thank you. I apologize again. Thank you very much. - Move, please! - Your rays are back. - Thanks. In a minute. - Someone gonna move Mrs. Gardner? Guy, Line 6. Thanks. Excuse me. Thanks very much for calling back. I'm looking for an autopsy report on a patient called Claude Minkins. It would be early hours of yesterday morning. Just looking for a cause of death. I'll hold, thanks. And that's it? That's all you have? Just pulmonary embolism? He'd obviously been in a hospital. I wouldn't rule it out as a symptom... Someone get the gurney! I have his lab report and frankly, it's completely beyond belief. We have a burn coming off the bus. All right. No, forget it. Forget it. No, really, thank you. I have to go. I understand. Thank you very much for calling back. Did he bite? One down, one to go. How we doing on Dolson? - We've been through a dozen shelters. - Fourteen. Plus the hospitals. We're making runs through Grand Central twice a day. Okay. Keep pushing. I guess we're looking for a body by now, but... He's still alive. He'll be needing medication. I'll make out a list. Perhaps you're mistaken? I don't see how that's possible. With whom did you speak? I didn't get a name. Someone here who called me back. At 1:00 in the morning. Gave you a cause of death, which you didn't believe. It just didn't make much sense. I can see that. I have no record of this man. I think, in fact, you have. If you could take another look. It's Minkins. M-I-N-K-I-N-S. Pulmonary embolism. I have no record of this man. Sorry. Who's actually in charge here then? That would be me. I've been here since midnight and I made no such calls. Okay, so let me just get this straight: No one phoned me, so that was my imagination running riot... ...and you've no record of a patient of mine who died 24 hours ago. Your hospital's known for losing patients. Living and dead. What did you say? What did you say? You're quite a creepy person. Before, I thought you were obstructive or inept. But now I think you're much more sinister. I think you better leave. - You lying about this? - Everything okay? Yeah, thanks. Here, I'm just off. You can pop your boss back in his drawer now. Apparently, you were threatening and abusive. For God's sake. I mean, that's just ridiculous. I was mildly sarcastic, but under the circumstances... ...I was astonishingly restrained. The doctor you spoke to needed protection from an orderly. That is just a lie. Who told you that? The chief medical examiner. - This is starting to sound really weird. - Get me the charts and go home. What about the body? They have no receipt on Claude Minkins. Who called me? Who? Give me a name. I didn't get a name. I was busy. Isn't this a little strange? "A little strange"? It sounds a lot strange. I did not threaten or be abusive to anyone. Then my apology was unnecessary. This whole thing has to be connected. You saw the report. The guy had a metabolic meltdown. He had a total failure in every system. Ever see numbers like that? Of course not. The report's a joke. All it proves is our lab is even more fucked than people say. - Then what about the wristband? - What about it? Jeff, I'm not trying to be annoying. A man died on my table, and I have no idea why. This is a repair shop. We're not here to do research. I got 100,000 crises a year in here and I have a responsibility to each one. - I've heard the repair-shop speech. - Let me put it to you this way. I'm your boss and I'm telling you... ...drop this thing. Now go home and go to bed. - Judith. How are you? - I'm great. How's it going? Good. Yeah. Terrific, thanks. You don't sound convinced. No, I'm horribly aware you've come to ask about the intern evaluations. How behind are you? - I did do a few the other day. - How behind are you? - Criminally. - I could pretend I haven't seen you. Judith, that would be incredibly kind. - Thanks. - Lf you play for the residents. No, not basketball. I don't even know the rules. We'll explain them. It's for a great cause. Where am I? I'm your doctor, Mr. Randall. You're in the hospital. Am I okay? So far everything looks pretty good. Where are my clothes? My stuff? They're outside. They're safe. I was in the park. It must be pretty confusing, huh? We were wondering, is there anybody you'd like us to contact? Any family? My daughter, but... When did you see her last? Not since 1978. When her mother died. I see. Anybody else you'd like us to get in touch with? No, I'm pretty much on my own now. Thank you. Could you stand up for me? Forgive me for asking... ...but I need to ask you a couple of questions. - What is, say, six times four? - Excuse me. I was wondering, do you suppose I could get something to eat? Absolutely. - Why don't we do that right now. - Thanks. I'd appreciate it. It's 24, by the way. The answer to your question. I was a schoolteacher for 18 years. Minkins, Claude. He was here last year. He was an ER walk-in. Fractured carpal. What's that? Ankle? No, it's a wrist. Let's see. Phone number: 212-000-0000. - That means he's homeless. - Next of kin? - No. - None. Thanks, Pat. But he's got an outstanding balance of $981. What, for x-rays? Let's see. Radiology was $289, and then the lab work. His bloodwork was another $500. Why the hell is he having bloodwork when he had a broken wrist? We'll tell you. Looks like it's been dumped. Meaning? It's the system. It sucks. There's not enough storage, so every month... ...they have to pull stuff down to make room. And would there be a hard copy or whatever? You could try the Records Annex... ...but it'll take you a million years to get clearance. I'll tell you what. Can you do another one for me? Dolson, Teddy. Please? All right. I'll do Dolson. Dolson for you. Dolson, Theodore. Undomiciled, conjunctivitis, no next of kin. Another deadbeat. Outstanding balance, $645.80. This is for lab work too? Yep. Bloodwork. For conjunctivitis? I guess not. Let's see. Details. You sure know how to pick them. I mean, we have been bitching about this system since they put it in. Let me get this straight. You're saying someone... ...has deleted all this stuff? What? You mean on purpose? What the hell are you doing? I'm looking for the file on Minkins. He was here before. Someone tampered with his record. Anyone see you come in? Look, Jeff. There are so many things about this which are so odd. Would you include your recent self? You nailed a fellowship. You're two months away. You're going to places I could never get to. Anyone finds you in here, and you aren't going anywhere. So relax, okay? By the way, your mystery man? I called security. They're looking into it. Okay? Now, come on. Come on. I was fighting my ass off like a gladiator. He didn't have a knife, he had a machete. Did I say six inches? Fourteen inches long. No lie, man. The motherfuckers took my scrips and all. Wait a minute, what kind of stitching you call that? It's good. It's fine. Bullshit. I'm homeless, not stupid. It looks like the Bride of Frankenstein. Tell him. Those are terrible sutures. You're a terrible suturer. See? I'm gonna make you all happy. - Jack, can you finish this up? - Sure. Good. And what's next? Don't you have that important reception at NYU? Jesus Christ! Where you going? I'm in serious pain here. And this motherfucker's 12 years old! Anyhow, my apologies again. It's not a problem. You've met the rest of the team? I think so. At the interview. - Dr. Sharma. - Nice seeing you again, Doctor. - Very nice to see you. - Thank you. Dr. Cohen. - Good to see you. - How are you? - Dr. Breceski. - Welcome to neurology. And do you know Professor Myrick? Who has nothing to do with this program... ...but was here and wanted to say hello. You took care of a neighbor's son. A cab accident. They said you were terrific. Anyhow, I heard you'd be here and I just wanted to pass that on. Thank you, it's a great honor. So you're moving on? That's right. I start here in the summer. Well, that's great. If you think that ER was tough... ...wait till Jim gets started with you. Right, Jim? Dr. Myrick? I probably shouldn't, but can I ask you a question? Certainly. Okay, basically... ...white male, forties. Elevated thyroid functions. Enzyme toxicity just off the charts. Convulsions, high fever... ...pulse, pressure and vitals in total disarray. Who are we talking about? It's just a patient of mine. You'd have to rule out meningitis. Did you do a spinal tap? Oh, no, he died on us. What about postmortem? Believe it or not, we've lost the body. Well, that never helps. Bottom line, without a tap, you'll never know. That's what I thought. Thank you very much. Sure. I guess I was a big help. So? He's not gonna drop it. I'm headed out. I'll see you later. She's eating very well this morning. How you doing? - You take care of your shift? - My partner's gonna cover for me. So what's this guy's name? Luthan. Dr. Guy Luthan. You're okay on this, right? It's not gonna go in my memoirs. You can't handle this... ...you better tell me now. Look, I'm in, okay? I'm in. My ears are ringing. Could you just raise your right hand and your left leg for me, please? You don't hear it? In a moment, Mr. Randall, then we'll get you right back to bed. This is Observation Room B. We need help, stat. You... ...gotta stop... ...it! This tape was filmed 22 hours... ...after the removal of a 4-micron spinal section... ...at the tenth vertebra. Insertion of an electrical prosthetic... Was followed by... ...administration of I.N. 1 monoclonal antibody and so on. Patient Number 12... ...regained 75 percent operational mobility. And 26 hours and 14 minutes after his operation... ...his condition is stable. Take it easy, guys. We're not there yet, but we are getting closer. Those who've been here from the beginning... ...Helen and Billy... ...and can remember Patient 1, know how far we've come. Don't go wild, but your work, your suffering... ...your sacrifices will certainly be worth it. And like I said... ...we're not there yet... ...but we certainly will be there. Thank you so much. Literally hundreds of dollars worth... ...of unnecessary lab work wiped off the computer. And Jeff has access to that computer. So I go to the Records Annex to look... I shouldn't be there. To see if there's a hard copy of details of this lab work. And there's Jeff again. This time, making pretty unsubtle threats about my future... ...if I don't drop it. What do we do? I have no idea what they're trying to cover up. But maybe there's something we should be doing. This isn't what Jeff told me. - You spoke to him? - You're pulling over 90 hours a week. I looked it up. It's too much. People burn out. I'm not overworked. I brought you over. I'm your biggest fan. Jeff may not be a great boss, but I trust him. Exactly what I'd have said three days... When you accuse him of conspiracy, you start to sound a little odd. Yeah, well, okay. All right. There's no question I am tired. That's for sure. But I promise you... ...I'm not cracking up. I tell you what I'll do. I'll get you a copy of the original lab work on Minkins... Shut the fuck up! I'm really sorry. I apologize. I seriously think you should look at it. The cops, they call you, yes? - They still here? - This morning I hear something breaking. I call 911 right away. Guy Luthan? You're Dr. Luthan? I'm Detective Manning. Sorry about this. Fuck! Fuck! So, did they just break the door down? Looks that way, yeah. We called. We figured you worked... ...at Gramercy. The responding officers, they got here, the door was wide open. So anyone see anything? You mean a witness? No. You look a little punchy. Anything missing? I don't know. Like I said... ...the door was open. It's legal for us to look around. What do you mean? You talking about the hospital stuff? I've been at Gramercy for two years. All of this was being thrown out. You mean, the towels and shit, right? Finders keepers, right? I thought you'd arrest me. I am concerned about the half ounce of pharmaceutical cocaine we found. It was next to your bed. Do you share this apartment with anyone? No. I have to place you under arrest. "You have the right to remain silent. " "Anything you say can and will be used against you. " Something's going on here. "If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you. " Watch your head. While investigating a burglary... ...at the defendant's apartment, police discovered in plain view... ...approximately 18 grams of pure cocaine. The state has charges pending concerning theft of property... ...from the defendant's employer. - I don't do pending, Counselor. Talk to me about bail. We think there's a risk of flight. We're asking for $10,000 bond... ...and we'd like his passport. Look, I can help you. I'm $125 an hour. It was a bad search. It was a first offense. For $1,500, we could plead this out, suspended sentence. Excuse me, where you going? I'm trying to help you! This is Guy. If you have a message, leave it after the beep. Thanks. Guy, it's Dad. I'm sorry to keep ringing, I want to say two things: One: it turns out I actually knew your NYU chap, Coseeki. At the Royal Marston, back in the fifties. And two: I thought I might fly over to buy you a congratulatory Tom Collins... ...or whatever they drink over there. Possibly later this month? Let me know what you think, okay? 'Bye. "Pending the outcome of your criminal trial, Gramercy Hospital... ...will agree to suspend charges on the stolen property. " "As of today, you are relieved of all hospital duties and credentials. " "The contents of your call room will be forwarded to you. " "Your presence on the property without invitation will constitute trespass." "We've notified Immigration we'll revoke sponsorship of your work visa... ...should criminal charges result in conviction. " Well, that was quick. All that in 24 hours. Taken me longer to find a bed for a patient. It's best to move fast on these things. It's not the first time this has happened. Is that right? That might explain it a bit... ...because obviously, I'm having trouble understanding why... ...it's so easy for all of you to believe I just threw my life away... ...which was going quite well. Why I suddenly... ...out of the blue, took up drugs and threw it all away. It's hard to grasp why that's easier for you to believe... ...than that someone in this hospital set me up to stop me asking... ...about a patient whose body disappeared into thin fucking air. But that probably just makes me sound druggie and paranoid, right? I'll be specific. I think it's you. I don't know what you're doing, but I hope it makes you rich or... We found Claude Minkins. It was a clerical error. He was buried four days ago, potter's field. Guy, please. Sorry, Doc. Never heard of it. It could be some kind of men's shelter. Or a church? You never heard anyone talk of The Room? The Room? They got rooms all over the place. They got rooms all over this city. Everybody got a room but us, right? Thanks, Bobby. Thanks. You're talking about the worms, right? No, The Room. I know. Yeah, I know. Down with the worm people. It's some kind of shelter? Ain't no shelter. It's their home. It's that underground shit. The worms. Track rats. Mole people. I don't understand. The Room. There's all kinds of places like that. People living underground. Whole bunches of them. All over the city. You know it? I don't like it dark like that. I like the park. - Do you know where it is? - I don't go down. You gotta be a mole. And you gotta know the way. Wait a minute. Where can I find one... ...of these moles? I know a half-mole. The guy we turn the cans over to. I see him all the time. That's how I know about this. Can I meet this guy? Slow down, Doc. We gotta work something out. What are you talking about? You know, man. - How much do you want? - I don't want your money. Come on, me and you are friends. What do you take me for? - I'm sorry... - A couple of scrips is all we need. No way. I won't do that. Forget it. Doc, are you sure? I mean... ...this surely smells important. Excuse me. Excuse me. - What are you doing? - I came to see you. I saw you getting on the bus. I'm sorry. I wanted to ask you a favor. Look, Guy, I'm sorry. We all are. The whole thing... We're all in shock. I don't know what to say. You were a great doctor. I just don't know... ...why you needed drugs. Someone planted that cocaine in my apartment. Someone took the cocaine from the hospital and staged a break-in... ...to attract the police. What are you talking about? I need someone to check the staff logs. September 11, October 9, last fall. It's written here. I need to know who was on ER duty when Minkins and Dolson were seen. What are you doing? Why? Because someone who worked these shifts has destroyed my life. I'm fucked, Jodie. It doesn't matter what happens in court. I won't practice medicine again. Not here. Not in England. Nowhere. Ever. Why me? Because you have access to the fourth floor. Look, I've put my number on there. Please? Think about it. Althea Dolson? Althea. Right, I beg your pardon. Thank you. My name's Harbash. I'm a doctor at Gramercy Hospital. I wonder if you'd help me. We're trying to locate anyone who might know a Theodore Dolson. You don't. All right... ...thank you very much, anyway. What kind of pain is that? Right, so that's a sort of high fever and a sore throat. That would be very hard for me to say. You'd have to have a culture taken. Could you hang on for me? I've got a call coming in. Thank you. Sorry. Hello? It's happy hour, Doc. We have found Mr. Half-Mole. Right. You got our finders' fee... ...and Mr. Half-Mole says he knows about these rooms... ...and it's a $100 tour. You got 15 minutes to meet us. Okay, fine. Where? Grand Central information booth. And don't forget. No scrip... ...no trip. My man. Okay, here we go. I could take him out now. Listen, he's got a line on Dolson. Come on, man. He's gonna take us right to him. Shit! Shit! It's one way! Go! Pull around the block. - Go! Go! - I got it. Watch it! Fuck him. Go! Around here. Shit! Shit! Son of a... Why didn't you move the fucking truck? Are you fucking blind? Are you fucking blind? Move your fucking truck! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! I'll move the fucking thing for you. It's about time, man. So where is he? - Where is he? - He's behind me. Track 24. And, Doc... ...you be careful. Watch your ass. So, is it far? Excuse me. Is it far? Tell me how far, roughly. Hey, pal. What's your hurry? - Look, man, that's the straight shit. - Dr. Luthan. That's amazing. I swear I saw you in the park... ...talking to a Dr. Luthan. Hello? Are you there? Are we in The Room? So it's down there? Is it down there? Are we there? I'm not gonna pay you till I get there. I don't go down there. - How do I know you're telling the truth? - You're still alive. To the bottom and through. Hey, wait! Wait! Fuck this whole... Come on. Come on. Someone there? Someone there? Shit! Okay, look... ...if someone's there listening, I'm looking for Teddy Dolson. Jesus Christ! Let him go. Who are you with? Who did you come with? No one. Who sent you? No one. I'm looking for Teddy Dolson. - Claude Minkins told me about this... - Where is he? Where's Claude? Claude came into the hospital where I work. I'm a doctor. He was very sick. We did everything we could for him. He didn't make it. You've come for Teddy? Yeah, is he here? Are you going to kill him too? Jesus, I'm not killing anyone. Listen... Do you understand where you are? This is our home. We have rules. You think we keep healthy so you can kill us? - I won't kill anyone. I'm on your side. - Bullshit! - They don't believe you. - You're dead! Listen to me for fuck's sake! I'm on my own. I'm not killing anyone! I'm here because whoever did kill Claude has also fucked up my life. Is Teddy here? If Teddy is here and he's sick, you have to let me see him. He's here. - How long has he been like this? - Four days. They found him at the steam pipes, trying to make his way here. His fever, is it up and down? Pulse? We stopped trying to count. What are they doing to all these people? What do you mean, "all these people"? Claude and Teddy? And the others. What others? Gramercy. That's where we all go. What are you talking about? He knows! And this motherfucker's in on it. A runner's missing from The Condo. A guy from the train yards. A woman came through looking for her son. They take the strong ones. They take men. Why? That's why they do the lab tests. Who's "they"? Yes, that's why they do the lab tests. Someone's looking for healthy subjects. Why us? They think you won't be missed. So did Teddy say anything? Who found him? He never said nothing. He was just laying there, twitching and bleeding. - He's bleeding? - His back is all fucked up. I thought someone knifed him. I wanna turn him over. Give me a hand. On three. Two... ...three. Jesus Christ. They're playing with healthy spines. Someone's cut... - Okay, hold him. - What's wrong with him? - I don't know. How far is it to the street? - Why? - He needs a hospital now. - We take care of him. He is crashing, understand? If we don't get him on an IV, he'll die. Let's start by putting that body down... ...and getting your hands out where I can see them. Put the stretcher down. I'm Special Agent Hare, Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is Detective Burke of the NYPD. Get your hands above your heads and come forward. We got a sick man. We're getting him to the hospital. Maybe you didn't hear me. I heard you. I heard you. What's the FBI doing here? We're working a kidnapping. Have you seen anyone back there? No, we ain't seen nobody down here, man. It's just us. This man is dying here. You've got a radio. Call for help. Radios don't work here. Come on, Doc. Move it. We don't have all day. How'd you know I was a doctor? Shit! They're gonna kill us! They're gonna kill us! Oh, no. I ain't got no beef with you guys. Talk to me, Frank. Get going. All the way back. - I'm homeless. - Keep your hands up. Move. Move! You stay right where you are! If you want me out of here, just say the word and I'm gone. Just take it easy. Frank. Shit! Jesus. Bob! You son of a bitch. He's getting away! Let's go. Come on, Bob! Get going! Move! Frank, you gotta help me! Come back! Get me out of here! Hey, what are you doing? Dispatch. Dispatch. Twenty-nine to dispatch. We got a man on the line. He's armed. Judith? It's Guy. Can you hear me? If you can hear me, please pick up. Please pick up. I know it's late. I've been shot. You've gotta help me. This whole thing, it's real. There are three men dead back there. I swear, it's huge. Judith, please pick up! They hijack people from the hospital and use them for research. Triphase is a research program... ...and someone at Gramercy is working for them. Listen, there's a cop called Stone. Call him, he might believe me. I have to talk to you. Are you all right? Hey, you're bleeding! - Who is it? - It's Guy Luthan. You know what time it is? Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just... - It's 4:00 a. m. What do you want? - The staff logs, did you... What did you say? Jodie, please. This is really important. You have to be quiet. My brother's asleep. My God, what happened? I'm okay. Oh, my God. That's a gunshot. It's okay. It looks worse than it is. - You're walking around like this? - Yeah... ...I can't go home. What happened? It doesn't matter. I can prove this whole thing now. Listen. You'll come in and you'll be quiet, all right? This has to be looked at. Jesus. You're losing a lot of blood. Where did this happen? It's okay. No one knows I'm here. No one followed me. Shit. It's okay. Someone's here. What's going on? It's Dr. Luthan from work, from the hospital. It's okay. What happened? He was shot. Take your coat off. The staff logs, are they still there? And? We'll talk about that later. You're in shock. You need to sit down. Here. Take your shirt off. Hold this there. Put pressure on it, and I'll get a first-aid kit. I'll be back. So tell me about Triphase. I didn't even take lunch. I stopped for five minutes and there's six interns... ...watching TV, eating popcorn. And you've been running all day long. Tell me about it. What do you know? You better get his doctor. I'm on it. - He's coming around? - Yes. You can go. Can you hear me? My name is Dr. Mingus. You're in the Acute Care Ward at Riverside Hospital. You were found five days ago by the boat basin in Central Park. You'd been shot. You lost a great deal of blood. You've been in a coma until today. We didn't know who you were till today. We contacted your family. Your brother is flying in tomorrow morning. I need to talk to the police. Sure. As soon as you're stabilized. I can't move. The gunshot... As I said, you lost blood. But we have other problems to look at now. Why can't I move? I have some tough news, Guy. Listen to me very carefully. Can you do that? You sustained a serious blow to your upper back. There was a severe cervical fracture of the sixth vertebra. Somehow... ...we're not quite sure... ...your spinal cord... ...was cut. At the moment, you're paralyzed from the neck down. We did everything we could. I'm terribly sorry. Guy, listen to me. This is not the end of your life. Not by any means. I know it's hard to accept, but you'll learn to do things... ...that you wouldn't believe possible right now. You're going to have a different life, that's for sure... ...but it can still be a great life and a fulfilling life, believe me. Whenever you feel ready, you can meet with our counseling people. We have an amazing program here. Please... ...leave me alone. I'll look in on you later. Dr. Luthan? Guy. It's Dr. Myrick. I came over as soon as I heard. Dr. Mingus was a student of mine. I've seen your chart. It's a terrible thing. I'd like to try to help. If you want to help me... ...let me die. That's a common request. Please. Four hundred of potassium chloride in my IV. What if there was hope? There isn't. What if there was hope? What would it be worth... ...to be able to walk again, to be able to feed yourself? To go back to your old life? To be a doctor. What would you endure? What are you talking about? I'm asking you a question. What would that be worth? I can't live like this. With proper care... ...you can live 20 years like this. What would you do? What would you risk... ...to change that? I have a C6 break in my cord. What if I told you there was a chance you could be healed? That there was a procedure that offered you... ...a good chance... ...that you might walk again? What would you do to make that happen? Anything. Anything? You'd better think about that. What do you mean? What do you mean? Wait! Dr. Myrick? Quiet. We have to be quiet. You're not paralyzed. It's an epidural drip. I turned it off. You're not at Riverside Hospital. This is Triphase. You're not paralyzed. I don't know how you get out. You're on the seventh floor. There's a hallway just outside. Listen to me. You have to get out of here. - This is Triphase? - Yes. I found some clothes. Put them on. What are you saying? I'm sorry. It's just the stitches from your gunshot. I can't stay. - Oh, God, they're looking for me. - Wait. How can you be part of this? For my brother. I was driving the car when he was hurt. Because I was drunk. I have to go. Just try to get downstairs. I'm sorry. - But how? - I don't know. They're still warm. He can't go far. This is Helen in reception. What's going on? - Luthan's out of his room. - What? - We don't know where he is. - I'll take the east area. I'll grab the other side. Don, go to one. Stone still want that address or you going home? You kidding? We're going home. He still wants it. Okay, can you hold one second? The guy's a cokehead, for chrissake. I told you. He saved my guy. I owe him. Okay, Triphase. 403 East 14th Street. Look for Biosyntex. Got it. My God. I know you can hear me. We know you're in the building. You've gotta listen to me. You need to listen to me before it gets out of hand. Guy, you have to understand. We never wanted you involved. All the way along, we tried to get you to walk away. I'm not a murderer. I didn't know what to do with you. It was terrible to put you through it, but I had to do it. I had to make it real. You had to feel it to understand what it is we're trying to do. And it is real. The hope I offered in that room... ...it's real. I can grow nerves. I can grow nerves and control their patterns. Thirty hours before he came to you, Claude Minkins... ...had his spine surgically severed at the fourth vertebra. Teddy Dolson lived for 12 days. I can show you their charts. Complete neural regeneration. I can grow nerves. We just have to stop them overgrowing. We are that close. I needed human subjects. That's the awful truth. Growth factors only code to species. To do the work, you need human subjects. And most of them will die. These men... ...they're not victims. These men are heroes. Because of them... ...millions of people will walk again. You see them every night. They're lost or cold... ...or stoned or worse. They have nothing. No future. No family. Nothing. But here, with us... ...here they're performing miracles. I've spent time learning about you. You're a brilliant doctor. I'm understaffed. I need you. That's why you're here. That's why I put you through this. Let me show you what we do. Let me explain it to you. We need to talk. We need... Hey, how you doing? You need to see what it is we're doing. There's a Detective Stone down here. He'd like very much to speak with someone in charge. Someone's coming down. Great. Lock these doors. She stays here. I don't want him leaving here alive. Find him, okay? Gentlemen... ...how do you do? I'm Dr. Myrick. How can I help you? This is Triphase. - You've got the right place. - And it wasn't easy. It took us... Had a guy, spent four hours trying to get your phone number. So let me get this straight. Triphase is like a part of Biosyntex, right? That's it. Yes. Look, I'm right in the middle of a procedure upstairs. Could we... You know a Dr. Judith Gruszynski? From Gramercy Hospital. - Is she all right? - She's fine. She got this nutty call from a guy named Luthan. Dr. Luthan. You know him? Is he a student? No, he's in Emergency. He's a Brit. Did you check the scrub room? Nothing. Do it again. I'm going down. Can I ask what the hell you do here? Research. Medical research. I'm a neurologist. Is that right? Are you talking about the doctor arrested for drugs? That's right. I really do need to get upstairs. We're freezing samples. It's a delicate procedure. We gotta get a statement. Later? Could I call you? Or come by the precinct? You know... ...I'll be done here in about 45 minutes. All right. We'll eat. Perfect. It's nerves, right? Excuse me? Neurology. It's... ...study of nerves. Yes, nerves. Are the doors locked? No. I'm 68 years old. I don't have much time. Three years with a rat to get to a dog? And after five years, if I'm lucky, maybe I can work on a chimp? We have to move faster than that. I'm doing medicine no one's ever dreamed of. This is baseline neural chemistry. You're killing people. People die every day. For what? For nothing. Plane crash. Train wreck. Bosnia. Pick your tragedy. Sniper in a restaurant, 15 dead. Story at 11:00. What do we do? What do you do? You change the channel. You move on to the next patient. You take care of the ones you think you can save. Good doctors do the correct thing. Great doctors have the guts to do the right thing. Your father had those guts. So do you. Two patients on either side. One, a gold-shield cop... ...the other, a maniac that pulled a gun on a bus. Who do you work on first? You knew. You knew. If you could cure cancer by killing one person, wouldn't you? Wouldn't that be brave? One person and cancer's gone tomorrow? When you thought you were paralyzed... ...what would you have done to be able to walk again? "Anything. " You said it yourself. Anything. You were like that... ...for 24 hours. Helen hasn't walked for 12 years. I can cure her. And everyone like her. The door's open. You can go out there... ...and put a stop to everything and it'll be over. Or we can go upstairs and change medicine forever. It's your call. Maybe you're right. Those men upstairs, maybe... ...there isn't much point to their lives. Maybe they're doing a great thing for the world. Maybe they are heroes. But they didn't choose to be. You chose for them. You didn't choose your wife... ...or your granddaughter. You didn't ask for volunteers. You chose for them. And you can't do that. Because you're a doctor. And you took an oath. And you're not God. So I don't care if you can do what you say you can. Or if you can cure every disease on this planet. You tortured and murdered those men upstairs. That makes you a disgrace to your profession. I hope you go to jail for the rest of your life. I'm sorry. Help him, please! Please help him. He's been shot! Oh, no, no! God, no! Help him, he's been shot. Help me. Please. Get some backup. You okay? I didn't think it was possible, but your cafeteria is worse than ours. I like it. I'm sure you do. So will you visit us soon, or are you too high and mighty now? I think I'm too high and mighty. - I'll come. Soon. How is everyone? - Pretty good. Jodie starts again in the fall. Yeah, I heard that. That's great. She did okay. So come visit us. Don't forget who your real friends are. The ones who fired me, right? You looked pretty guilty. You didn't look unfishy yourself. I'm sorry. You should be. - Take care. Good to see you. - Good to see you too. - Next time, I pick the restaurant. - Right. Dr. Luthan? You're from Dr. Cohen's office, right? My name is Myrick. Ruth Myrick. - Would you like to come inside? - No. Thank you. I have been trying to decide what to do about this... ...ever since my husband's death. As far as I can tell... ...it's pretty much all the data from his research. I think you should have it. I believe there's hope in this package. Why me? I believe my husband was trying to do a good thing. But in the wrong way. Perhaps you could do it... ...the right way.
