A memory makes you believe That he has never gone That there's no need to grieve And that the past lives on. A memory Comes to you in your dreams But it's not what it seems And haunts you for eternity. A memory Has all the tenderness Of those days of giddiness That seem to fly by. One evening, you went away And I felt that I'd die But I've known since that day That people can lie. Franois! Well, son? - You're looking good. - You too. The car's just outside. Can you park here? Anne swung me a special pass. Leave it... You don't seem too americanised. No, not really. At least, I hope not. Why? Didn't it go well? Oh, it did. But three years were enough for me. I won't ask about America. You'll get grilled later. You're looking good. So you said. I'm impressed. Your harem's looking after you. Talking of the harem, Aunt Line's doing lamprey. You're warned: it's lamprey for lunch. That suits me fine. Things haven't changed much in three years. It depends. Wait and see. Wait and see what? Just wait and see. Want one? Yes, please. They still smoke in America? Of course. You know, they're less dumb than they make out. Anne's running for office again. I suspected she would. Michle wrote she loved being a councillor. She'll be mayor next. God help us! You're not keen? She already has enough on her plate. You see that shop thing there? Her HQ. Pretty low-key. It's a game. No, she takes it seriously. She'll explain. She has political ambitions. It's always interested her. You don't want a wife in parliament? Actually, I couldn't care less. Don't tell her that! Still think nothing's changed, wise guy? I see what you mean. - A total overhaul? - Well? Not bad. Like a Chicago drugstore. Crazy, isn't it? I managed to buy the bookstore and set up a medical lab on the sly. That's illegal. Not really. I'll show you round. Tomorrow, please! Tomorrow, sure. Or next week. You haven't asked about Michle. So, how's Michle? She's gorgeous. And gifted. She's studying psychology. Didn't she write to you? She did. The joys of love Are but a moment strong The pain of love endures A whole life long You finish, Marthe. You look older. I hope so. I can't say as much for you. - Hello, Marthe. - Hello, Franois. I've done lamprey. I know, Dad told me. He can't keep a secret. It was a secret? Everything's a secret here. Hello, Franois. Hello, Michle. Not too tired? Had a good flight? Are you pleased to be back? I spent four days in Paris. You took your time. I didn't get a kiss today. You didn't? Is this all you have? Only one case of goodies? It's the one I left with, you know. What's wrong? Are you disappointed? Take him up to his room. Quickly, we eat as soon as your mother gets in. It's too heavy. Let's carry it together. Time for a scotch? Whatever I say, you'll have one. Remember your room? I should be able to. Wrong! This one's mine. The bedspread's changed. And the bedside lamp too. It was a birthday gift from your father. Not bad. So where's my room? Where mine used to be. Nothing's changed here I think. Nothing. Want me to help you unpack? No, it's okay. I'll do it after lunch. Well then... Still love university? I like it. It gets me out of here. I won't ask about America. It's bound to be the topic during lunch. Lunch, I can manage, I think. I've prepared my speech. They didn't really understand why you left like that. I imagine you didn't explain. My mother and her bodyguard. - Her bodyguard? - Matthieu. Matthieu Lartigue. Her running mate. He steers her like some sort of pilot fish. Your father can't stand him. Let's go down. Why can't he stand him? He thinks he's the one who got mum into politics. The local council isn't politics. She's ambitious. I'd like us to eat right away, if possible. - Is Franois here? - He looks good. Will you stay? I can add an extra plate. I'm sorry, I have a lot to do at the office. Time for a scotch? No, have your lunch. Really, I have a lot to get done. Stepmother! "Stepmother"! That's new. He always called me Tatoune. You're back at last. Yes, I've finished over there. This is Matthieu Lartigue, my campaign running mate. - Delighted. - How do you do. Come for coffee later. I'll try to. I'll be going, then. See you later, maybe. Poor man, he works so hard. I bet he loves it. Everyone, come and eat. Hurry! The trouble with Americans, those I met anyhow, and I met quite a lot, is that they're obsessed by God and money. It doesn't make life easy. But they're warm-hearted and energetic. I'm only sorry for them that they don't get to sample lamprey like this. I'm glad you like it. I've never seen people so wary about food. I'm wary about theirs! Their food's better than most people here think. You like burgers now? It depends. They can't produce a wine like this. We don't usually drink Haut Brion every day. No, but we produce it. Not personally. Have some more, dear. - Don't we get more? - Of course you do. I'm sorry. What is it now? Yes, Matthieu. Can't he let us eat in peace? Why is she getting into this again? She enjoys it. Politics has always hurt the family. Dad, please... Forgive me. I just don't like it at all. We all have our weaknesses. I'm sorry. A bit more lamprey? No thanks, Aunt Line. Sit down. Call Marthe. She's watching the tart. Help me. What's in the tart? - Pear and almond. You remember? - You bet. Matthieu's coming to show me something. I don't know what. You look worried. No, not at all. Coffee in the conservatory? What do you think? Excellent idea. I hope you don't prefer American coffee now. No, don't worry. You get good coffee in Chicago. - Here's Sir Lancelot. - Grard, please! In here, Matthieu! Come on. Sit down. I'll pour your coffee. Thank you very much. You look upset! I imagine I do. Something awkward has cropped up. We should talk in private. Maybe you think so but certainly not. We're a family, you see. Well, your family's under attack. - All the more reason. - Under attack? This kind of thing happens during campaigns. They smile and then strike low blows. Who is "they"? I don't know. Shall I read it? - Give it to me. - Please, Anne. Read the rag, Matthieu. You're interested now? It is a rag. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. "Madame Charpin-Vasseur is at it again! "She's taken a liking to it! "Now they intermarry, there's no stopping them! "The degenerate savages!" I'm sorry, I can't go on. "The degenerate savages! "In 1981, Charpin-Vasseur and his brother's wife "died in a mysterious car accident. "So the widow married the widower, "to try them both out..." That's insane! "An honourable family, honourable but jinxed! "In 1958, it celebrated the Fifth Republic "with a plane crash that killed our candidate's father and mother. "They were just Vasseur back then. "The name Charpin was in the sewer where it belonged." Don't get up, I'll go. No, she's not in. Of course. I'm her aunt. What? Oh, my God! Both of them But how They were together? Aunt Line! Are you all right? I'm fine, dear. I was thinking. I'm just fine. Is that all? Is this charming piece over? No, but... Carry on. It's most instructive. I feel very awkward. I should leave. No, you have to stay. It's all linked to the elections. Here's the rest. I'm sorry, Aunt Line. I think I know what it's about, dear. Don't worry for my sake. "Pierre Charpin, the grandfather, "held an important administrative post from 1940 to 1944. "So his son cut off all ties with him "then got shot in the Resistance shortly after D-Day. "One bad egg in the wrong basket. "A fine omelette! "Pierre Charpin was then murdered in strange circumstances. "One of his daughters, Micheline, was suspected." That's so unfair! The case was dismissed, Aunt Line! It doesn't matter, dear. "Her acquittal convinced no one, "no more than the theory of political revenge. "Pierre Charpin's wife died "of a possible broken heart a few weeks later. "The Charpins' annus horribilis. "Fate has been hard on them these last 50 years. "Let's hope that, on election day, "Madame Anne Charpin-Vasseur, the queen of flightiness, "will uphold family tradition and be soundly beaten." Right. Who wrote it? I don't think we'll ever know. Couldn't we try to find the printer? A printer would never have touched such a charming piece. Spare us the sarcasm. Forgive me. I loathe politics. It isn't politics! If you'd stayed out of this, we'd have all been spared this literary masterpiece. Shall I make more coffee? Yes, please, Aunt Line. How can she just sit and listen? She's very strong. What are you going to do? I'm going to fight, dear. - What's our schedule? - Low-rent housing but... We change nothing. Don't you agree? I don't need to agree. I just follow. Why don't you use the dishwasher? I work faster than it does. I never asked for it. Try to move with the times. Progress isn't all good. Do you understand? I have no intention of telling you what you have to do. I know, Grard. But surely you can see as I can that your stubborn determination to get involved in... I don't know what to call it... The social world? Social world, then. It spells only disaster. And this tripe is the last straw. What's so funny? The image... Tripe turning into a straw. Why not breaking the camel's back too. The reality's less amusing. Coffee for everybody? Thank you, Aunt Line. - I'll pour. - Thank you, dear. You see all kinds of stuff during elections. Spitting venom is part of the game. You don't understand the situation. - Every word is true. - It is biased though. Yes, it's biased. But it's true. Thank you, dear. Right... Matthieu, my boy, let's get going or we'll be late. Politics, as you call it, requires punctuality for the low-rent housing visit. Whatever I may say, you'll change nothing. Coming to Sunday's reception? Do I have to? There'll be pretty girls. I'll be there, then! - Need a ride to the campus? - Not this afternoon. Skipping classes? We're on strike. - You're what? - That's right. Ridiculous! Why? No idea. A day's strike will do us good. It won't hurt anyone. Come on, you Bolshevik. Want to come? No, dear, I have the gardening to do. You don't need me, do you? I need you on Monday, ma'am, to sort papers. What's the "ma'am" for? To keep it professional. No one's coming into town? No one. Thanks, but I'm going to rest and unpack. Okay, see you youngsters later. Is there a drop of coffee left? I'm afraid not. Anne! - Are you angry with me? - Don't be silly. Can I help? I'd like that, unless you're being curious. Did you pack this? Sure. Not bad! You'd have done better? Maybe, maybe not... See a green parcel? Take it, it's for you. That's sweet. Not opening it? There's no rush. - You couldn't care less? - I could. I guess studying psychology has made you complicated. I just want to be alone when I open it. So go somewhere and open it. I want to stay with you. It's a baseball bat. I want to stay anyway. I know why you left. You do? You were afraid of what you might do. You think that? Is this worth it? How did they vote last time? You can pick up votes from abstentions and the Far Right. And you renovated the place. That's what you tell people but you did as much as I did. You'll do all right. Why are you so devoted, Matthieu? Tactics. Career planning. All politicians bide their time. You're ambitious, then! You know I am. Here we are. Have they had that leaflet? We'll have to wait and see. Apparently, you have an admirer in building A, third floor. Jules Labire, a retired railwayman. How do you know? He only took your ballot paper into the booth last time. It seems pleasant enough compared to 4 years back. Indeed! We can be proud of ourselves. Hello, my dear. Everything okay? We had a quiet morning but we haven't stopped since. I need to go to the lab. I'll be in to lend a hand later. Hello. Everything okay? Yes, no problems at all. Glad to hear it. - Sir! - Just a second, my dear. No, there are no side effects. Excuse me a second. There's someone to see you. - Thank you, Vronique. - A girl. I know, Vronique. That's that settled. Adrienne, my dear! Come in, you darling child. Please, have a seat. You can count on us. - I think we drew a blank there. - You never know. - Shall I ring again? - Never! I feel like I'm begging. The others do it so we have to. Poor us! Here we are. Jules Labire. Your admirer. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. That's a good start! The poorer they are, the meaner the dogs. Don't panic... What is it? It's about the elections. You've heard? Anne Charpin-Vasseur, your town councillor, is here. Open the damn door! Come in! Thrse, lock that runt up! Sit down, please. Well, you got your third-floor apartment... I should hope so too. I waited long enough. You're happy now? It's better than the ground floor with all the kids dirtying up the windows. A pity the boiler starts up every three minutes. I know. The boilers are on my programme. The real problem is the bastards who cause trouble. The neighbourhood has improved though. Yes, that's true. But there aren't any benches. If you're out for a walk and your legs get wobbly, you've only got your thumb to sit on. Note that about the bench, please. Why didn't they think of it? This is Mr Lartigue, my right-hand man and running mate. He's a highly competent jurist. Have you noted the bench? Yes, and top priority for the boiler. The elections are next Sunday. You must come and vote for me. And for Mr Lartigue. We need you to keep on with our work and give Mrs Labire her bench. We need your help and support. We're too old to do much for you. You can vote for me. The more votes we have, the sooner we'll meet your demands. I kept my promises last time. Except the bench. Precisely. You have to help us with your vote. The more we have, the more we can do. I'm counting on you. We'll make this a good place to live. We won't bother you any longer. Thank you for your warm welcome. You can count on us. Not bad for a Nazi-Iover's daughter. She's not his daughter, she's his granddaughter. Not bad for a Nazi-Iover's granddaughter, then. I don't trust her aunt, with her innocent airs. What did she do wrong? Not a lot, just killed her father! You can't say that. She was acquitted. Besides, her father was a real shit. He shopped his son to the Krauts. Not many went that far. I remember it well. You can't remember yesterday! Anyhow, this says different. That's all crap, malicious crap. So vote for her if you want! It's going pretty well. - With the Labires? - In general. You're optimistic. We must get the old dear her bench. After the elections... Gangway, you old farts! Hey, quit pissing me off! Charming... What is it? Mrs Fanny Marnier? It's about the elections. Anne Charpin-Vasseur is here. - She's here? - Yes, I am. You know Sunday is election day. No, I didn't know. The local elections. Well, come in. - You've come to see me? - As you can see. How's the family? How many do you have? Four, plus my sister's two. She's looking for work. - Do you work? - You bet I do. I don't know how many kids you have but I can't keep up. Here, let me show you something. Where's my soup got to? You've eaten it, grandpa. No, I haven't had my soup or my dessert. You have. What? My father-in-law. He can't get about. Does your husband help? Life's not like on the telly. He works nights to make a bit of money. I see. It must be hard. Come and vote on Sunday. I need you. That'll get me out for once. I'll bring the kids. You're registered to vote? I don't bother with papers. I'll ask my husband later. That's good. Thank you for seeing us. Goodbye, and all the best. Goodbye, children. What do you think? That last one? I feel quite sick. We've had worse. Her husband doesn't beat her and the kids look normal. Maybe, but that's no comfort. We don't need you here pissing us off! It's about Sunday's elections... Anne Charpin-Vasseur is here. Go fuck yourself, bitch! Tell her, kids. Go fuck yourself! - That's enough. - I'm sorry. An occupational hazard. I've had enough. Let's go back to the office. Yes, we're on our way back. Yes, it all went very well. What are the bastards saying? I'll kill them! More leaflets! The same as before? That's bad enough. We're on our way back. Let's get going. You see. There was no need to go to America. That's not why I left. Why then? I wasn't running from you. Well, not you in particular. I was scared of doing something stupid. And not just with you. Do I have to explain? Explain. - You know I love you. - Well, well... The Charpins always love the Vasseurs and vice versa. Together, they make a fine line with a grand estate and a handsome fortune. Like in a Zola novel. You're the one stuck in the past. Who cares about that? Yes, I know, you don't care. Neither do I. But even so, aren't you bothered things keep repeating themselves? You think it's normal? It's been going on for four... - what am I saying? - for six generations. It's nothing to do with us. Don't pretend not to understand. I was attracted to you at thirteen. That late? You were very pretty when you were young. The attraction grew as the years passed. I started to stifle here. I could feel the weight of the family saying, "Go on, son, keep up the tradition." I ended up hating everyone. Surely not Aunt Line? No, not Aunt Line. Nor me? Well, I hated you a little. The more I loved you, I hated you at the same time. Thanks a lot! That's why I went to Paris to study law. I couldn't take any more. I remember. I was furious. I noticed. So was your mother. And my father. And Aunt Line too. That surprised me. To think I stayed here so long with all my problems... Going to Paris wouldn't have solved them. It did, as you can see. After four years in America, I come back here, I kiss you - well, I snog you - and I feel fine. I snogged you. And America has nothing to do with it. Time has passed and feelings have matured. Did you sleep around a lot there? Reasonably so. It's more heavy-petting than anything. But still... you can talk them round. Have you slept with boys? I've loved you since I was little, so I'll answer. Yes, I've slept with two boys, once each, and I found no pleasure in it. It made me sick. So I stopped. I thought of you. Perhaps I'm frigid. If you want, we could... I'm sorry. It's okay, it helps to talk. Can you breathe in here? You arrived this morning and you're stifling already? Missing the Rocky Mountain air? Go ahead, make fun. But as soon as my father showed me round, before even, as soon as I entered this house, I felt I'd never been away. But I'm asking you... Can you breathe here? I'm sorry, but when I want to breathe, I get some air. I don't make a fuss. You're pretty mature for your age. Watch out. They say girls are earlier developers. I can do that. No, it's okay. I have an idea. Why don't we go to Pyla? That way, we'd get some air. - When? - Right now. We'll take your car and stay till Monday. Is that possible? Everything's possible. We just need to ask Aunt Line. It's her house. Aunt Line! Have you got acquainted again? What do you think? Do you mind if we go to Pyla for a few days? To Pyla? Together? Yes, do you mind? Oh, no, not at all. I'm delighted. I'm glad you like the house. But, there again, what will your parents think? You've hardly seen your father. I know. But... If you'll lend it to us, we'll go right now. I'll get the keys. No one's been out there for five months. It could be dusty. We'll give it all a spring clean. Have dinner at Pierrot's. He's open, he'll be glad to see you. Old Pierrot. He still has his moustache? He had it in December. Don't drive too fast. Don't worry, I'll drive. Good. She's such a maniac. What are you talking about? I bet Aunt Line's right. She isn't. She's talking rubbish. Are you sure? Anne couldn't care less and my father won't understand. - You're an angel. - Far from it. Off you go. Have fun. - You understand me? - Yes, I do. Wait! Can I join you out there on Sunday? They won't need me for the reception at the town hall. Of course, it's your house. I adore you, both of you. - How will you get there? - In my old 2CV. My God! Can it get that far? It runs very well. Off you go now, get out of here. See you on Sunday. Micheline! Franois! Hurry up, children. Come down right now or we'll leave without you! No Pyla for you! We're coming! Hurry up! I want to unite people around simple, practical ideas designed to improve life in our town, devoid of ideology. Therefore, I'm not seeking the backing of a party. These are local elections. I'm running to serve the town as a whole. How was it? Perfect. Thank you. Anything else to add? In reply to possible personal attacks? No, I see no need to. Fine. Good luck, then. You're very kind. You were very good. Is it airing tonight? - So they said. - They don't waste time. Well, we do. Let's get to work on the envelopes. See Simone about the pack of twelve. Need a lift home? I don't like to keep asking. I don't mind. I'll use Michle's car tomorrow. They've gone to Pyla? Try to understand. They really wanted to go. But Franois only got here today! What can I say? They can do as they like. Grard will be furious. After four years, surely he can wait two more days. You actually seem pleased. Yes, Anne, I am pleased. They seemed so happy to be going. Yes, I am pleased. - I'm sorry. - You understand? Of course I do. Did they go in her car? Drat, I wanted it for tomorrow. I won't offer you my 2CV. If anyone sees you, it might lose you votes. There again, it's not showy. But if they see you advancing in fits and starts, they'll think you'll do the same at the town hall. Advancing in fits and starts is still advancing. What's so funny? Nothing, just silliness. We were talking about my 2CV. That's no laughing matter. That crate's a disgrace. Aren't the children here? No, they decided to go to Pyla. Just for the day? No, they're staying until Monday. What is all this? A glass of scotch? Please. What is all this? He wanted to go there. No need to get wound up. After four years away, my son runs off as soon as he can! See, you're getting wound up. Tell me why! I've no idea. Ask him when he gets back. Here you are. Thank you. What do you think of this? It doesn't matter what I think. Why not let people do what they want to do? I'm worn out! How are you, darling? Pretty worn out too. Visiting low-rent housing isn't much fun. Sorry but you wanted all that. Yes. And I don't regret it. I'll see how dinner's doing. Why should they go to Pyla? We can't talk about it all night! They took her car. Can you drop me off tomorrow? At what time? Before ten if possible. Can't your guardian angel do it? He's kind but he's not my driver after all. No, he's not, I am! You're my husband. Dinner will be ready in ten minutes. It's not that dirty. Not dirty at all, you mean. You didn't see my room in Chicago. I can imagine. It was even worse when I left. I'm starting to feel hungry. - What about the bedrooms? - What about them? We need to clean them, make the beds... Please. We can do that when we get back. Let me take a quick shower. The water may not be hot. I'll take a cold shower, then. Who's this I see? Haven't seen you in a while. Hello, Pierrot. - I thought you were in America. - I'm back. - How's Aunt Line? - Very well. She says hello. - And your parents? - They're well too. A nice table for you. I'll sit here, if that's okay. - Make yourself at home. - Old habits... - Not very busy tonight. - Tomorrow will be though. Your mother's running again. She's got the bug now. I bet your dad's not happy. He was hopping mad last time, I remember. - He's getting used to it. - Good job too. - Oysters and sole? - Perfect. - Okay. Red or white? - White. Right you are. A dry Doisy Daene. That suits me. Good to see that old rascal. Could be more discreet though. You said it... Four years ago, just one month after you left, it was here that Mum told Grard she was running. He blew his top. He calmed down - you know mum - but he sulked all evening. What a jerk! I'm really enjoying this. They're so bad in America. They rinse them in fresh water and it kills the taste. Franois... Tell me why you left. I already did. Tell me everything. I want to keep the mystery alive. You don't like your father? Why? Don't you like him? Answer me and then I'll tell you. You don't like him? Keep your cheap psychology. You don't like your father. Not a lot, no. Neither do I. Why don't you like him? He has some failings I dislike. It's not the opposite? You don't like his failings because they're his? So, Sigmund, why don't you like him? I've never been able to stand him. Sorry, but that's the truth. And he took my father's place. I like Anne but she took my mother's place. You see, they're not alike. Listen to me. When I was a kid, my parents used to fight all the time. No one told me! They fought when no one was around. Otherwise, the old hypocrite was all smiles. You think he's a hypocrite? Hypocritical, deceitful, evil and hedonistic. You hate him! Incredible! No, I don't hate him. Could have fooled me. One day, I think I heard mum tell him he wasn't my father. What did he say to that? I can't remember. You never know, we may not even be cousins. You never know. Just a boy and a girl who enjoy each other's company. That would suit you, huh? You know, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm wrong about all this. Too late! Can I have a drag? Can you do everything? Shut up, you pig! You're the pig here. All those years we've wasted... I don't agree. It's good this way. This is the right moment, see. Is that American pragmatism? You're too smart for me. I'm not! My cigarette! You can't sleep? Neither can you. It's the full moon. It's easy to blame the moon. You're right, it's not that. It's only natural to be a bit agitated, right? It's something I have to tell you. I'm scared you'll be mad at me. It would have to be bad. It is bad. If I don't say it, I'll feel dishonest. I love it when you have qualms. It's that sick leaflet about the family. I had an idea... That my father wrote it? That's stupid, right? Yes, it's stupid. We're both stupid. What's wrong? I don't know. I felt cold. Go back to sleep. Go on. Something's bothering you? No, nothing at all. Please, go to sleep. Okay, don't worry. Let me tell you something. I almost gave it all up. Why on earth didn't you? It's that leaflet. You can't let sleaze rule your life. Am I wrong? Do as you like, darling. I'm going back to sleep. - What's that? - A draught. Will you buy me croissants every day? For long? When's Aunt Line coming? I don't know. This afternoon. You see... Two days together is all you can stand. You're incredibly witty on Sunday mornings. You make good coffee. Your croissants are warm. Micheline, come and see! I've made you a fort. I love you. Michle! Michle! Franois! How sweet of them... Franois, can I borrow some toothpaste I forgot my tube. What a scatterbrain. Aunt Line! In the kitchen. What are you doing? You've made my bed up. This is the least I could do. Did your crate make it all right? No problem. Believe me, that thing will last forever. They're weren't upset? They were pleased, in fact. This way, I'll bring you back tomorrow. Your father was angry about you leaving so soon. I'm flattered. Can't he leave us be? What's bitten you? She's a rebel, you know. How did mum take it? I think she understood. What about you? - What about me? - What do you think? I'm so pleased you like this house. I've been so happy here. You're crying? So many memories. I love you more than anything. So do I, it's only natural. I was here when your grandfather and my sister died. I was expecting them. They had been away in Italy. Yes, I know. I'm silly to keep mulling over it. Why don't we play Monopoly? Or Scrabble, if you like. What do you prefer? I'm bound to lose at Scrabble. But that way one of you will win. You've blocked the board up nicely! Open up a new line. Don't count on it. Going back tomorrow? Yes, I have a class at 2. I leave early. I've been enlisted. Your mother wants my help and your father needs his papers sorted. Aren't they exploiting you a bit? That makes... twenty-three for me. It's normal to help Anne. Anne, okay. But my father... He could find someone else for his papers. I can't refuse. Too bad, I'll open up. - He's such a tyrant. - What's wrong with you? 19 for me. No more letters. He went and sold the vineyard to the Japanese... That helped build up the lab. None of us are winegrowers, you least of all. A seven-letter word. Thank you. Conceal You've been concealing things. Add everything up. I'll get us something to drink. I want to tell her my idea about the leaflet. Do you think I should? If you don't, I will. It's a true pleasure for us to welcome these leading French television performers. We are sure they will magnificently exploit the benefits and beauties of our region. Spoken to Maurice? He has some good news for you. Sorry, I need to see someone. I'll leave you in good hands. We are determined to contribute as best we can to make your stay a happy one and ensure your project's success. I felt it wise to make the most of the presence of our esteemed guests to celebrate with you what I call my return to civilian life. As you know, my great age and my state of health prevent me from running for office again. Next Sunday, you'll be electing your new council... - Something to drink? - Please. What's the good news? That's not bad at all. Well done. Quite remarkable! Did you like it? Yes, very much. Well, Anne, my dear, has Lartigue told you? You're well placed to take over from me. Allow me to tell you that I'm delighted. I could do with a drink. Let's not count our chickens. How long will you be with us? About four weeks. You don't have a drink. Let me get you one. - Will you trust me? - Certainly. What was your name again? Dominique. I'm Grard. Promise you'll wait here? - I promise. - I'll be right back. Did you see that hideous thing about my family? Yes, it's quite shocking but you needn't worry about it. It mustn't influence people. It won't, everyone knows it's all rubbish. - Any idea who's behind it? - Not at all! To be quite honest, it's not worth the attention. It reeks of the Far Right. More of hatred and personal vendettas... You can always ask Brissot if you like. He's here? My dear, I invite every elected representative. I don't share Brissot's ideas but I won't make him a martyr. Come over here. I hope you'll like it. You're very kind. Thank you. From the Domaine de la Solitude. Pretty name, isn't it? Here's to our solitude! Who do you play in the film? I'm a perverse and seductive woman. Perverse, I can't say, but seductive is spot on. What do you do, Grard? I work in curative chemistry, my dear. I run a lab and a pharmacy in town. Heaven must have sent you! I've had a sore throat for three days. Pop into the pharmacy to see me tomorrow. Let me jot the address down for you. It's here, in Glignac. It's not far. You can find me at number 24, Avenue Jean Jaurs. It's easy to find. What time suits you? Luckily, I'm not shooting tomorrow. In the afternoon, around four? Four it is. Perfect. My dear Brissot, our friend Anne has a question for you. How kind of you to speak to me, old chap. It's clear you're leaving soon. You're very bitter although I've been decent with you. Decent! I've made 15 propositions with not one voted. I don't know if you'll be succeeding our friend Montesquiou, I'm certainly not keen on the idea, but I would like you to take a closer interest in us. In that case, I'd like to know if you're behind that leaflet about my family that has been doing the rounds lately. I've seen the thing. I promise it's nothing to do with us. I find such tactics despicable and unfair. I'd like you to see that you're one of us. We're on the same side, we share the same interests. Excuse me, I've heard all this before. Like it or not, we're on the same side, just shades apart on the spectrum. It's nothing to do with you? I give you my word! Neither me, nor my friends. We respect your family too much, including a member whom you tend to ignore. Thank you for that information. Sorry to have bothered you. We'll work together, you'll see. - Friendly, isn't he? - The start of a great friendship. But he's not behind the leaflet. You never know with them but I tend to agree. - I'm thirsty. - So am I. And hungry too. Calm down. Have you seen my husband? Having fun? Stop the car. Hello, Marthe. What's wrong? I have to go shopping. Do you have your keys? Of course. Isn't Aunt Line back? I haven't seen her. She must be at the office. Okay, see you later. I'll be going, I'm late. I'm used to automatics now. What will Aunt Line tell your mum? I don't know. Nothing, I think. But you can't tell with Aunt Line. Her reaction was a bit odd. She didn't seem surprised. Nothing surprises her anymore. - Why did they go? - I told you. They wanted to be alone. They cleaned the house too. It needed it. - They were happy. - It would be wonderful. I've always dreamed of it. So has Grard. So has Grard. They don't want our dreams. They're right. The poll results are confirmed. The new one tomorrow won't change anything. As for the leaflets, there haven't been any new ones. Let's not get carried away. Okay but things are looking good. Is the news good? You could say that. That's no reason to slacken off. Let's get to work. No illegal bill-posting. And no trouble. Keep it dignified! - Remember to stop for lunch. - Don't worry. We need to eat too. Are you coming? No, I'd rather go home. Grard needs me this afternoon. He could wait a week. He's doing it on purpose. He's furious. Is he that scheming? - He's a spoiled child. - That's less serious. I'll get it. Yes, dad. Yes, an hour or so ago. It was very pleasant. No, it was my idea. Yes, but... I wanted to, you know. Don't get wound up. I'm not, I just didn't understand. Didn't Michle mind? Don't worry, she didn't put up any resistance. She was utterly charming and pleasant. No, Aunt Line isn't back yet. Yes, she's helping Anne. Here she is. Put her on when you can. What's on for this afternoon? I'm taking Michle to her class and going to see an old teacher. Yes, I'm borrowing her car. Yes, the Renault. Here's Aunt Line now. It's dad. Yes, Grard. Yes, as we said. Around three, okay? See you later, I'm busy. Did you tell mum? No. I thought it over and I don't want to stress her now. It's looking good so let's not stir things up. We have no proof anyway. A week living like hypocrites. Dear, we've been living like hypocrites for years. Let's be philosophical. People have lived like hypocrites since the dawn of time. That's what you call civilisation. Where are the toothbrushes, please? I need these bills sorted according to the date. You know the score. Just for the pharmacy? The pharmacy and the lab, you'll see. - If you feel like smoking... - No, thank you. There's someone here to see you. Just a second, my dear. Excuse me. Don't worry about me. I'll be here an hour or two. Bang on time. I appreciate female punctuality. - I expect you to cure me. - Trust me. Come upstairs to my office. My accountant might bother us here. I hope you don't have any wicked intentions. - I'm a true innocent. - So you're dangerous. I'm not really into afternoon quickies on the corner of the desk. You're right, you deserve better than that. I must tell you... I only have my throat to offer you. The ideal woman! The pig! The pig! I'm sorry about this, Franois. But it makes me sick. Don't apologize. He's always been like that. I remember when mum was alive. I was too young to understand but some things seemed strange. You hated yourself for not loving your father. I hate myself a little but I've never really loved him. Mum neither, you know. How do you mean? Your mother slept with my father? They were in love, dear. - Is that true? Are you sure? - Of course. Did mum know? I suppose so. That's why she married Grard. I don't know. He can be very charming, you know. Mum isn't charmed that easily. You're quiet. What do you think? I don't know. I don't care. I like Anne, she's tough. She'll be home soon. It's almost 7. My father will be back too. Chins up, children. Just one short week to go. It won't all work out by magic. We'll wait and see what we do. Aunt Line's right. It's a good job the gardener comes tomorrow. I searched his office. He has a printer. What were you after? I have no idea. Something to prove he wrote the leaflet. I even searched the wastepaper basket. - Did you find anything? - No, not a thing. He's not stupid. Turn the oven down, Marthe. They're not here yet. Anyhow, that proves nothing either way. Hello, you runaways. We didn't run far. You could have told us. - Is your mother home? - She'll be back soon. I'm worn out! Can I get you a scotch? No, I'll go, don't worry. - Stay for dinner. - I'd be in the way. No one will mind. I'd like you to. Come on! - It's late, isn't it? - You're not too tired? - Is Grard here? - Of course. We're all here! - I'm sorry. - Don't worry. Want a drink? No, thank you. I've invited Matthieu to dinner. Excellent idea. A drink, old chap? - I'd love one. - Go ahead. Hurry up, Marthe will be furious. I'll add a plate. I'll see to it. We could manage with one car. Maybe, but I promised to pick Marthe up. I want to check her vote. I'll come with you youngsters. I have to ask Marthe something. I bet he won't vote for her. Chapert, Patrick... Voted. Charpin-Vasseur, Anne Vronique... Voted. Charpin-Vasseur, Grard Paul Christophe. Voted. See you at home. Vote well, Marthe. Vidot, Marie... Voted. Keep the sweet bit for Grard. He loves that. We'll leave you together? You don't want to come? No, I have an essay to write. Besides, I know the result. May God hear you. If you want room to work, use my study. Just this once. Thank you, that's kind. Work hard, honey. Do you want me to stay? No, I have to study. Besides, you'll have fun. You really won't come? No, I have things to do. I don't like that kind of thing. All right, let's go. You have the keys? Grard's study! You lucky girl! I'll make the most of it. - I'm sure your mother will win. - I hope so. I can tell. Anne Charpin-Vasseur... Are you pleased? It's looking good. I can't believe it. Have you met my stepson? Franois, this is the mayor. Only until this evening. - Pleased to meet you. - Sir... Interested in politics? Only from the outside. You were in America, weren't you? Absolutely. A great country. - Isn't your husband here? - He's gone for cigarettes. If you're thirsty, there's a bottle of water in my office. - In your office. - Oh, please... It's true. It's going just as well elsewhere. We could end up with a majority. - Filthy little bitch! - Let go of me! Think I'd let him dishonour my family Answer me! Let go! - Good place to work, isn't it? - You scared me! I didn't hear you come in. Why are you back so soon? Your mother's so busy. She prefers me out of the way. Excuse me. Please, my dear, go ahead, work. Isn't Aunt Line here? I think she's out in the garden. - Would you like one? - No thanks. Go on. It clears the mind. What's your essay about? The notion of guilt. "The Morbid World of Fault". Dear God! Cheers. Are the results good? You know I don't give a damn. Come on, drink up! - You have to let me work. - I will. It isn't good? It's excellent. You see, I told you: it clears the mind. I like to see my baby girl work hard. I'm not your baby girl. But I love you like a daughter. - Well, almost. - Not again? - What? - You know what. You sleep with my son even though he's virtually your brother. Stop it! Are you out of your mind? No way, you little slut. You're drunk. You stink of scotch! No, I don't! Let go of me now. Why? Going to scream? No, I'm not going to scream. I know you're not. You're behind that sick leaflet. What are you talking about? You wrote that leaflet. Turns you on to think that, does it? Aunt Line! Aunt Line! He's dead. The lamp! We can't leave this lamp here. There's one like it in the attic. Don't move. Just don't move. Are you all right? Are you all right? - Do you feel like crying? - I can't. That's good. You must control yourself and help me. Listen to me. You didn't do anything, you hear? You didn't do anything. We're going to carry Grard to his room. Can you manage that? I don't know... Please, you must help me. I can't carry him alone. Do you trust me? Of course, Aunt Line. Help me, then. I'll explain later, dear. Careful... Just a second. Let's just keep on dragging him. Stop a second, I can't go on. Michle... My angel, listen to me. You know that tragedy that happened after the war? Of course, but you didn't... Don't say anything, please. Listen to me. I've never told anyone else this and no one will ever know. My father did some terrible things during the war. He worked for the Nazis, he drew up lists of Jews for the camps, even children. He helped hunt down the Resistance. And when Franois, my brother... left to join them, he let him be killed as well. Yes, I murdered my father. The awful thing is, I never regretted it. It's a terrible thing to have done but I've never regretted it. Don't tell me any more. You're right. Let's finish this. I won't do this every day! There he goes! We must be out of our minds! I'll go. Hold him nice and tight. Franois... Franois, my boy... I just wanted to tell you it's looking good. What? Oh, my God! Yes, I can hear you. Of course. Yes, I understand. I'm on my way. - Sorry, I have to go. - What's wrong? Nothing. Michle wants to see me. Fancy! And you run like a good doggy? You've won now anyway. Off you go. We'll be back soon too. Can you drop me off, Matt? Of course, madame. What are you doing? What are you doing? I don't know. I don't know how to explain. I feel as if I'm doing things backwards. You had no right to say that! My brother was the man of my life. He loved me as much as I loved him. Come to your room now. Sit down. Listen carefully, dear. I killed Grard, you hear? You didn't, I did. I can't let you. Can't you see? It's an incredible opportunity for me. I've waited sixty years for this. Every day, I hoped that something... I can't explain it. It's impossible, Aunt Line. But I understand. It's not for your sake, it's for mine. It's not even that. I understand, Aunt Line. I feel the same way. You still have your Franois. He'll help you. I was all alone. It was hard, you know. But I can put it behind me now. Way behind. I'm free. How funny, we're going to lie to everybody. I want to tell Franois the truth. I won't lie to him. Franois... Yes, all right. But no one else. You promise? No one. Look me in the eye. I killed Grard Vasseur. I killed him because... because he's a foul bastard! He... I'll think of something. You kept all that pent up inside so long... Oh, my dear, time doesn't exist. You'll see. Life is one perpetual present. I can hear Franois. I'll go. Wait here for him. Michle... Franois... Don't say anything. Aunt Line told me. I'm so... I'm here now. - The news is good. - Totally unexpected. Not at all! You prefer mayor or mayoress? Let's celebrate! - Where are they? - Upstairs. We'll be right down. Congratulations! Well done, mum! Come on. Let's put on a brave front. Processed by C.M.C. - Paris
