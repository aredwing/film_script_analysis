Like there's not enough time to get through all the things you have to do. You start cutting corners just to make it through the day. My dog walking business isn't exactly dog walking. Oh, this is gonna hurt! Oooah! Ugh! Some days I feel like a punching bag. Hashtag butt kicked by sister. Others a babysitter and ballet partner for my little sister Gillian. Ah! Ah! Uh! Lawn polo, sport of the future! Whoo! Two inches, pal, two inches! Sometimes, I'm just a doofus with a pair of scissors and a lot of grass to cut. She's my little mini-me. Ooh! I'd loved to dream of something better, but who has time to dream? Uh. If you wanna impress Lori Collins, why study CPR? You should be learning mouth to mouth. Girls like Lori only have eyes for hero types. People who save lives. Right, like lifeguards. Help me study. I gotta pass the test this year. Your pulse is racing. This CPR really works. Now take a deep breath and hold it. Okay. Oh. Wow, you're really into this. Ugh! All you can do is breathe and hope an easier life is somewhere out there. Yeah, this is pee patrol. Got our eyes on a foreign object. Uh, copy that, number two, let's get that thing out of the pool as soon as possible. We're going in, over. Look at the size of that thing. What are they feeding these kids? Floater alert! Floater alert! Better hurry, dweebs, it looks like it might need mouth to mouth. Go back to the kiddie pool. Ignore him, guys, he hasn't had his protein shake yet. Uh, she's gone, you can stop sucking in your stomach. I think she smiled at me. She laughed at you. Yeah. Look, you're only my best bro and all, but you can't compete with the Vances of the world. That guy is confident, cool, plays a mean guitar, drives a wicked car and he's a lifeguard. And maybe next time you decide to work at a place solely because the girl you're not so secretly in love with works there, you'll actually read the job description. Go on. This is ridiculous. It's only one! It's not gonna bite. Dude, you didn't even go in the water. Yeah, but I saw it, too. I saw it. For the ninth consecutive month dating back three summers, please join me in giving a great big Crash 'N Splash round of applause to lifeguard of the month, and my homeboy, Vance Handsome! Mwah. Ugh, ugh, ugh. Denied, sorry, bro, that one didn't make it. I gotta go. What a freak. Forget boy Baywatch. He might be lifeguard of the month, but you've got a glass half full this set. You got a sweet ride, a snazzy job, added with a cool best bro. What? My sweet ride has fleas. I fish poo for money. And my best bro is you. Your uncle has landed. Uncle Mitch? Nephew, huge me! Mm. Okay. Uh. Ta-da! I made your frown disappear. Master Sheldon, nephew's faithful companion. My frown is all good. Okay. Gentlemen, I need you assistance. Whoa. Ta-da! What is that? Obviously it's a tanning bed. Frankenstein's tanning bed. It's an industry thing. All the magicians rock the tan in Vegas. Have you seen Copperfield? Dude like sweats the vitamin D. He really puts the copper in Copperfield. Right? Anyway, I picked up this baby at a sweet storage auction out in Burlington. Once I figure out how to turn it on, I'm gonna baste in my own juices. You're uncle's weird. Uh-huh. Now, for my next trick, I'm gonna make this miracle of not-so-modern tanology go from this van to that garage without even laying a finger on it. - What? - Now. Uh, gift cards? For your efforts, kind gentlemen. Chop, chop. Yeah, there's a 99.9% chance there's nothing on these. I'll take those odds. Listen to your Uncle Mitch. He's the one in charge. Adam, don't forget about Gillian's dance recital. Oh, and don't forget about karate class. Bye, guys, have a magical time. We will, thanks. See you in one week. - Love you! - Bye. They'll be okay, right? Yeah, what could go wrong? Your brother's a magician. That's what I'm afraid of. Wah! Okay, who wants to see me pull a rabbit out of my pants? I'm out. You're in? Mm-hmm. All right. Gotta get back. Ow. Ow, dude, stay on your side. I can't win if I do that. I have to say, running power through the treehouse was the best idea since glow-in-the-dark toilet paper. Tomorrow, I'm gonna put a signal booster on the SAT router so we can stream HD to the 42-inch wireless. Yeah. This is gonna be great. Adam's got no parents for a week. Uh! Oh, come on, Gillian, are you serious? Ew. I'm in the zone. I ain't got time to wipe. Where is Gillian, by the way? She asked me to play hide and seek with her like two hours ago. What? Two hours ago? What can I say, she's good at hiding. Like pro level. But you didn't even look for her. Strategy, Baker, I wait 'em out. What, do I got something on my face? Gillian! It's probably best to stick together, you know? No, no, no, we'll take the basement, you take the garage. All right. Gillian? It's your old pal Sheldon. Look, I'm really sorry I didn't look for you. No hard feelings, right? Gillian! Hello? If you're down here, I just want you to know it was all Sheldon's idea. Ah! Gillian, this is Uncle Mitch's tanning bed. I don't think you should be... Ah! Surprise! Uh, uh, uh? What? That is not cool. I'm telling mom. Hashtag. What? What does that even mean? Gillian, where's Adam? Getting a tan. What is that? Guys, I gotta get out of here. Open it, open it. It won't open. It's like a safe. What? Guys, okay... okay, so now it's glowing and spinning. Why is it doing that? Uh-oh. Uh-oh? What does uh-oh mean? Just open it up! He looks even paler than usual. Okay. The party's over. You guys gotta go. Uh. Uh! Do you know we talk in our sleep? Uh, aaahh! Uh! Oh. Uh. Uh. Oh. Ah! Oh! Cranky. What is it? What's wrong? Oh, just a scream. Yes, I thought I saw a... clown underneath my... my bed. A clown! A... where? I hate clowns! Uh, it was just a bad dream. Video games after midnight not a good idea. Promise to behave? Uh. Oh, those are from last week. Oh, so I smelled. Who are you? What do you mean? I'm you. All right. Ah! Oh. Am I that bad? Uh, Sheldon... dude. This should be very cooling on the eyes. And now the cucumbers. There you go. Hashtag treat yourself. I can't watch this. You do know it's not me, right? Ah! What are you? An evil twin? A doppelganger? What have you done with our wingman? Guys, guys, it's me, okay? That's not me. Well, it is, kind of. It's like... it's like a clone. Like a clone thing, you know? Clones? Like brothers from the same brother? This just doesn't happen. What? Did he just appear out of thin air? No. Here it is. No, no, no. I saw it! I'm next! There isn't gonna be a next! Ugh! Hey! I said there isn't gonna be a next. You do realize that was the cord to the treadmill, right? Yeah, I do. Whatever. Dude, this is the most awesomest thing that ever happened to us. If you can't see how amazed balls this is... Okay, fine, it's amazed balls, but we have to play it safe. You guys have to agree that we won't go anywhere near it until we decide exactly what to do with it. Mm-hmm. All right, good. 'Cause right now we got bigger problems. You already look ten years younger. Okay, Gillian's in her own world, so she probably won't notice. But nothing gets past Uncle Mitch. He may not be a very good magician, but he's a master of observation. You have got to stop working so hard. What the... Here comes the boom. Did you make me chocolate chip pancakes with smiley faces on them? Your favorite, right? Sherlock Holmes is definitely on the case. Uh! Greatest nephew ever! Okay. But I mean what if he's dangerous? How do we know that thing's not a complete psycho? Uh, it's smiley-face chocolate chip pancakes, dude. That's like scientific proof. What a beautiful day. It's strange. He's an exact replica of you, but you don't have anything in common. He's responsible, organized and makes a mean pancake. It's as if the machine is somehow overcompensating for those personality bits you're missing. Baker! Ah! Do I or do I not pay you good money to mow my lawn? Well, see, now that you mentioned it... Look at it! It's four inches! Four inches! My hair isn't four inches. You measure your hair? If it's not done by the time I get back from doing Pilates, I'll find someone else to do the job for ya. Capiche? Okay. Gesundheit. Hey! There's a lot of other Adams out there. Uh, other Adams? I don't really know anything about. Just get it done. Okay. Come on, baby. Remind me why you cut Tony Pepperoni's lawn again? Because my allowance is like five bucks a week. Besides, Mr. Galatte's my best customer. He's your only customer. Exactly. That's why I can't lose my only customer. And I can't miss the morning staff meeting at Crash 'N Splash. If only you can be at two places at once. Huh, huh? Yeah, if only. Uh. Oh. Hi, everybody. No one can hear you, because you're not holding the kickboard. Can everyone hear me now? Yes. As you all know, attendance at Crash 'N Splash is way down this year. Huh? Which means our annual Splash-apalooza fundraiser is top priority. This place needs our help. Now Vance and his crazy popular band, Vance Vance Revolution, have generously offered to headline the event. We love you, Vance! But there's still a lot of work to be done. So if anyone has any time to spare, I'm looking for volunteers with fresh ideas to join me on the planning committee. Anyone? Dude, did you forget to use deo this morning? Huh, huh? Oh, thank you, Adam. Huh? You're welcome. Seriously, Baker? What fresh ideas could you possib... You can barely keep your shorts on. Need I remind everyone of last summer's lifeguard test, the filter incident? Oh, no! Hi, ladies. Or does this have something to do with the time I caught you secretly snapping phone pics of Lori while she was teaching basic rescue? They were for the newsletter, okay? I swear. Okay. I don't know what you're so upset about. With you on the planning committee, Lori will have no excuse not to notice you. Yeah, I'm not sure that's such a good thing. Besides, where exactly am I supposed to find the extra time to... What is that? Oh, my gosh. He's supposed to be watching Number Two? Are you kidding me? What is this? Something Number Two whipped up. It's a low-fat mango-licous pineapple, banana smoothie. A taste of tropical paradise. Mwah. What? Care for one? Ah, okay, is this what you got me doing all day? Being your man servant? Just the one of you. The one of me? He hasn't tried starting a fire yet, has he? Oooh, uh-oh. Ah, it burns! What have you done? It wasn't me. It was him. Okay, don't be mad, but I crunched the numbers. And in order for us to expand our lawn business, we're gonna need a full-time employee. Unfortunately, mistakes were made, lessons learned. And to make a long story short, a copy of a copy... He isn't so bright. Huh? Oh, man, he's rocking a unibrow. On the upside, he's easy to train and extremely hard working. Ugh! Hey, Winston! Huh? What'd I say? What'd I say... about sniffing people? No. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Winston. Down, boy. There you go. You named him? We can't all be called Adam. Ah! Strangling yourself may be counterproductive. Also, way less profitable. Whoa. Whoa, that's like... Half the block. It was Number Two's idea to have them pay for membership. Adam, maybe we shouldn't overlook the possibilities this opportunity presents. Mm. Whoa! Man, if Lori doesn't like one of me, then why she's gonna like another? Just more of me not to like. Because it wouldn't be you. When you made your first clone, you were all worried about Gillian, doubting yourself, wishing you were more responsible. And who came out of the gizmo that night? Mr. Dependable, that's who. Uh. All you have to do this time is focus on what girls want most in a guy. What do girls want most in a guy? Oh! I know. A good listener. Someone they can just talk to about their deepest needs and innermost feelings. Uh, no. What they want is a guy who can party. Everybody knows that. When did you become an expert on girls? The closest you've been to a date is the fruit and nut section of the grocery store. I remember that, do you remember that? Fine. Who cares? We'll make both. Two heads are better than one, right? I guess. Uh! Ow! Just clear your mind and concentrate. Good boy, here you go. Go in. I'm going, I'm going. And may the best you win. Hm. Ah. It's supposed to go out with that one. And then disappears Oh, caught it! Sometimes... Ah, party boy in the house. Check me out. Mm. Oh, yah. Uh, sweet hat, yo. Too much party, too much party. Sssh. Oh, man, laser lights, laser lights. Come on, let's go. Danny, come on, come on. Sssh, ssh, ssh. Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Winston, here boy. Just drop it. Come on. What light through yonder window breaks? Ah! The sound and smell, love doth quake. Uh,. Ah. Sparks! And that, my dear niece, is a Mongolian soap trick. I know, impressive. It smells in here. Hey. You know, once you get past the grunting, he's actually kind of sweet. Dude, he's got rug burns on his knuckles. Gnarly, bro. It's a teddy bear. Uh, ah! Om, om, om. Huh? Yo, party dawg! What do we do? I don't know. Why are we whispering? Uh, who is it? Pizza guy. Free breadsticks, yo! Winston. I gotta go back to night school. Mom was right. Gentlemen, our objective... make Adam awesome. We need to turn this drab, dull, dweeby chunk of human... Huh, I'm right here, dude. into this. We'll take a multi-pronged approach, focusing on career advancement. Party ability. Right on. Rock star, love of popularity. Which of course leads to... Romance. Yeah, excellent. Oh. First up, impress Lori Collins. Intel I got at the kiddie pool yesterday confirmed that Lori will be chaperoning her baby brother's b-day at the mall this morning. Meaning, operation party boy is officially a go. Winston, you're on Gillian detail. Wait, wait, wait, Winston? He can barely stand upright and you want him watching my little sister? We need Number Two at Crash 'N Splash. He's got a plan to get you off the pee patrol. I mean, what about sensitive me? He can do it. Oh, hey. That's a big negative. Your uncle has an important gig downtown. Love and support, remember? That's Sensitive's thing. What about me? You're backing Adam at the mall in case party boy parties too hard. I always do. Any other questions? You okay, buddy? Mah, mah, mah, mah. Uh, yeah. When doesn't this plan blow up in our faces? Party coming through? Yeah! Whoo! Hold those hands. Come on, kids, this way. Stay with me. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Where'd he get that? I'm guessing from them. Security! Keep going, and call for backup! Have party, will travel! Whoo! Dude with the lampshade, stand down! And pli. And lift. Lift. Lift. Uh! Whee! Nailed it! Sorry, I'll get that later. Nephew, thanks for tagging along. Boy, your hair grows fast. Anyway, thought if you saw me in action it might help you understand the magic that is Mitch. Uncle Mitch, the only person who needs to understand you... is you. How is this my life? Oh, there, there. It's not that bad. Not that bad? I had to pay them to let me work this place. Oh. I was supposed to be one of the greats. But I can't keep up with all these upstart magic yahoos with their tight leather pants, the cool tattoos, their awesome tans. I've tried to mix things up. I even got a nose ring last fall. Worst infection of my life. Maybe that's your problem. You're not them. You're you. You're Magic Mitch, and that's pretty magical. Excuse me, young man, is this where we get our bingo cards? Sorry, ma'am, there's no bingo today... just magic. Oh! What he say? They canceled bingo again. What? There's no bingo today. Get the coins out of your ears. Uh! Wow, tough crowd. This place is way too clean. Someone's been in here. Security breach! Baker! I've been going through the books, Ed. Why aren't you on pee patrol? Because then I couldn't be figuring out a way to save Crash 'N Splash from running out of money and shutting down for good. Phew! And how exactly are you gonna save the park from closing down? It won't be easy, but I found some profit-maximizing shortcuts to boost revenue. We're still gonna need Splash-apalooza to be a huge success, but if you do exactly what I say, Ed... this park will have a fighting chance. You had me at profit-maximizing shortcuts. There it is! No, he's not a lampshade. He's wearing a lampshade. Right. Now where did he go? I shouldn't even be here today. There's fliers to be made and tickets to be printed. And Vance has this crazy list of demands for his band. Party. Oh. So what you're saying is I should just stop worrying and just go with the flow? What I'm sayin' is you need to party it up. Oh, cake! Oh, yeah, yeah. This is so much fun and way less stressful. I know, right? Oh, yeah, baby! That's what I'm talking about! Whoo! Dude knows how to party. Plan B then? "I like to smash people's faces into really expensive cakes." You have some nerve being anywhere remotely near me. And since when did you get a ponytail? Oh, it's a clip-on. I like what it says about me. But that's not why I'm here. I've come to apologize. Wait, no, no. Excuse me, random stranger. Oh. Would you mind turning that up? Oh, sure. Love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kick start Thank you. Circle! Shotgun Uh? For you. It's great, it's great. All right, well... All I need's a little love in my life All I need's a little love in the dark A little but I'm hoping it might kick start Me and my broken heart Okay, you win. Apology accepted. What do you do for an encore? I was hoping to discuss a little Splash-apalooza over a nice, organic root bear perhaps? I can't. I have a co-captain's lunch meeting with Vance. Oh. How tragic. Perhaps another time then. Danny, initiate Operation Mustache. I got a 10-14 in Tower 3, need back-up immediately. Copy, kid. Uh! Hey! Who did that? Him! Yo, what's up, Vance? Come and get me! You in the lampshade, stop! Oh, yeah, rock and roll. Out of the way, coming through. Ahh! Lifeguard! - Lifeguard! - Hey! Lifeguard. I got you, Baker! Bring it, Vance! Can't hide from me. Touch down! Ah! I got you now. Whoa. Baker. Smell you later. Oh, when I get my hands on you. Uh! Later, dudes! Come on, boys! Huh? Vance can't dance, you are clear for lunch. I hope you don't mind, but I gave Phil a sweet tip to whip us up something special. What is it? It's one part chicken nuggets, two parts fish and chips and two parts real cheese. I call it, son of tuna melt. Oh. Try it. Adam, this is really lovely... Shush, my melancholy mermaid. But there comes a time in every man's life where their own mortality must be thrown to the wind. Like the seeds of indifference blown asunder by the lips of a hungry goldfish. I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about. Neither does she, but I think it's working. And if I should be swept up in a hurricane of jealously, let it rip me limp by limp until my beating heart is all that remains. Defiant in its own conviction for a breeze only for... Vance. Huh? I gotta go. I got you, Baker! Vance... are you okay? We should probably get you to first aid. I'll go with you. I don't feel so good. Uh. She's never gonna talk to me again. If there's any consolation, she doesn't really talk to you now. Keep that chin up, kid, we're gonna change that. Now let's get out of here. Let's go. Oh, a little bit of this, oh, a little of that. Uh, uh, uh! Guys, I've been thinking. Maybe what we're doing isn't right. I feel like such a liar. And Lori deserves better. Whoa, dude, I know we've had a few bumps, but you can't just give up. Uh, ouch! I'm giving in to expectations. What about Splash-apalooza? You're a two-person planning committee? I... I don't know. I'll tell her something came up. Hey, you're home. Oh! Ah, guys, it's her, it's Lori. It's Lori. Hide! Duck and cover, dudes! Run! Whoo, be cool. In a lot of countries, slamming the door in someone's face would actually be considered rude. Is this one of 'em? Sssh. Here, here, come in, come in. Me casa you casa. Stupid. You don't have to pretend anymore. I know your secret. You do? It's not what it looks like. I wanted to tell you, but it's hard to explain. I admit I was a little surprised at first. But it's nothing to be ashamed of. It isn't? I just never took you for a poet before. You left it at the snack bar. Ah. Don't be mad, but I kind of flipped through it. And? Coming down! It's okay, I'm a professional. You haven't seen a small set of silver keys, by any chance, have you? Come and get it, Uncle Mitch. I'm on it. Here we go, all right. Thank you. Wait. Here I am, rocking like a hurricane Stupid bicycle. Lori! Why is Vince here? Oh, we've got this senior lifeguard barbeque thing. I told him to pick me up here. I didn't know Adam Baker had a house. Lifeguards. Yeah. Can't be late, I better run. Let's go! Hi, guys. Nail you later, loser! I'm not a loser, I'm a magician! It's a respected profession. Don't sweat it, bro. You can't compete with that. He's a senior lifeguard. With a car. And a band. And amazing hair. Wait, wait, that's it. Why didn't I think of this before? Guys, the only way to fight perfect is with perfect. Ready or not, here I come. Oh, it's totally going down. Wish I could see it with my own two eyes, but nature called and I must answer. Hi. You're in my seat. Oh, yeah? Who's gonna move me? Ah! Help! That's my save. I got you. Everyone back, give him some room. Adam? Thank you. That was bodacious. And that's how it's done, Vance. Urh! Mind if I borrow some of this? Come here you little twerp. Baker? Great work, homeboy. You, sir, are in the chair. What? This is my shift. Not anymore. Vance, you're on break. It's time to give the new talent a shot. He hasn't even tested. Pfew, tested? Did you see what he did over there? That's real life, son. The kid's got the stuff, now give him the chair. - But Mr... - That's an order. You do realize I must destroy you now? Bring it. Wow, I'm awesome! And I'm dead meat. Vance! Vance! Wait up! Vance! Wait up! We need to talk. Vance? Vance, we need to go over the set list for the fundraiser. Why should I help Mattis? I'm like lifeguard of the century, and he's gonna take some rookie's side over mine. Vance, you're overreacting. Am I? I just got dethroned by Captain Pee Patrol. Need a lift? Huh? Thanks for the ride. No problem. What's going on with you, Adam? Every time I see you you seem like a different person. Maybe you just don't know me well enough... yet. We should do something to fix that. Well, we do need to talk Splash-apalooza. Seven o'clock then? Sounds... Perfect. Guys. We're bringing him in too soon. He's not ready. What? What'd you mean? I'm totally ready. Look, I even got my lucky socks, see? Ugh, oh! Lori's not just some girl. We can't risk it. Maybe you have a point. We're running out of first impressions, and I'm not sure we want our best player on the bench for this one. No. Man, you're right. I can't sit across from someone like Lori and act suave and sophisticated. I can't even figure out my socks. I'm just gonna call the whole thing off. Whoa, whoa, no way. I'm not standing up, Lori. Just trust me, I got this... 'cause we'll be right there with you. I feel kind of underdressed. I thought we were just meeting to talk about the fundraiser. Uh, uh, you know, fundraiser talk makes me hungry. I have to get in there and save this or she's gonna walk. You can't just barge in, she'll know you're a fake Adam. Just wait. He's supposed to tag out any second now. So I made two fliers. Mm. Um, which one do you like better? I like, um, colors, font, pretty. Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom. Dude, what are you doing? You got like zero game. Dude, I told you to trust me. Give me the jacket. No, no. Give me your jacket. What? Oooo. Great, now look what you've done. Forget it, I've got this. He doesn't got it. Um... what happened in the bathroom? There was crazy toilet suction in there. You wanna get out of here? Yeah. Okay. I've got something to tell you. You know that guy you saw today? The cool, confident one who swooped in and saved the day? Well, it's not really me. Not even close. I mean, that was like a fluke. Truth is, I'm not even that good of a swimmer. I failed the lifeguard test three years in a row. Oh, yeah, the filter incident. Well, maybe I can help you. Show you a few tricks of the trade, one lifeguard to another. So where are you taking me? To a place I know you'll love. Come on. Where are they going? This isn't the plan. Where's he going? I know you like this place. Let's go. Wow! Don't you get enough working here all day? I love it here. I mean, I used to make my parents bring me here once a week all summer. I can still feel the road rash from all hours I spent on the Plank Plunge. I know it's weird. It's not weird at all. Actually, I'd come here on summer vacation and see the lifeguards and think, "wow, they get to come here every day." There's not a better job in the world. And... I can't even think about what would happen if... this fundraiser wasn't a success. It will be. Okay, but for right now, let's not think about that. Let's just have some fun. Ha! You won? How'd you win? Holy. Do you want this? This is a disaster. Lori doesn't wanna play skeeball and go on the tilt-a-whirl. She's a sophisticated girl. Dude, chillax. It's going great. Great? But this is my date, and he's embarrassing us. Want this? Whoo-hoo. Uh! Ah! Baker residence, may I ask who's calling? Sweetheart, it's mom. Wow! Who it is? You know darn well who this is. Quite goofing around. Ugh. Don't you ugh me. My minutes are running out. Adam speaking. I know who's speaking. What's going on over there? Oh, dear mother, oh... You sound weird. You must detect the joy in my voice, but rest assured there's nothing to worry about here. Everything here is just... No! blessed and wonderful. Okay. What's going on over there? Go for Baker. Adam Baker, you put your Uncle M... Down. Put it down. Who's that? Wrong number. Like the legend of the Phoenix Come on. All ends with beginnings Yeah, I know. What keeps the planets spinning The force from the beginning Look We've come too far Make sure it's two inches. To give up Yard work party! So let's raise the bar Whee! This is so fun! Whee! Are you seeing this? She's up all night for good fun I'm up all night to get lucky This way, puppy party. Ride canine coming through! Oh. Aw, aw, look at my beautiful Penny Pants. Look at how beautiful you are. We've come too far To give up who we are Ah! Ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh. Uh! Ah! Ugh! Ow! Are you okay? Yeah. I don't know what happened. Nice shades. Uh. Yeah, I don't know, I was just trying out a new look. Yeah, my look. Are you supposed to dropping off Gillian at soccer practice? It's already done, so I thought I'd swing by the park and do lunch with Lori. No! I mean, she's busy today. Tonight's the fundraiser, and she has to go over some last-minute things with Vance. Ugh! Oh, oh, oh, wait, Handsome and Lori together? Ah, he's trying to get in between me and Lori. Lori and you? I mean, uh... we. Okay, well, we only have a few hours until the Splash-apalooza. There's a lot to do. And, plus, Uncle Mitch told me that I have to help him with this birthday party thing. Okay, I guess I'll just round up the boys and take care of Handsome once and for all. No, just leave it alone. That's an order. Whatever you say, boss. Pfllt. Baker. There you are, Baker. Perfect timing. You can say that. I need to speak to the Splash-apalooza planning committee. Where's the other half? Yeah, she's not coming. And if you want to talk to Lori, you're gonna have to go through me first. Give me a break, Baker. I'm finished with you. Done-so. And the only thing I want for you to do is walk right over to Mr. Mattis' office and turn in your whistle. And why would I do that? Because if you don't, you'll have to explain to Lori and everyone else why Vance Vance Revolution isn't playing Splash-apalooza tonight. What's so funny? You obviously don't realize who you're dealing with, Vance. Oh, yeah? Tell me, who exactly is that? All of us. Or everyone. Oh, hey! Uh! You. We're everywhere. Party! Party! Oh, yeah! Oh, Vance! Ah! This is my park now, Handsome. And you're gonna stay away from it. Because we'll be watching everything and everywhere. Got it? Ah! Bye. What's going on? Where's Adam numbero uno? What, are you his mother? No, I'm his best friend. Oh, yeah, really? Best friend? Then why did he put me in charge? Where is Handsome going? He had better get back here pronto. He has a show to play tonight. Oh, yeah, he's not gonna be coming back ever. What do you mean? Why? He told me he was gonna work for Water Planet. That conniving traitor. Yo know how life or death this fundraiser is. How could you let this happen? I don't know. I mean... by not caring. Uh, Mr. Mattis, you'll have to forgive Adam. He's not quite himself today. Yeah? Well, he's got three hours to find me another headliner or he's fired. What? You can't fire me. I'm your accountant. Okay, then you're fired. What? He's fired. And if you don't find me another headliner, you're next. Boom! See, I told you cleaning can be fun. And disgusting at the same time. Ugh! Mm. Alakazoo! We love you, Mitch! That was great, Uncle Mitch. I know, right? No better feeling than showing someone that the impossible is indeed possible, What you said last week was a game changer. I said that? I sa... I said that... I said it. I wasted all that time trying to be like every other magician out there. But what makes me different, makes me happy is... you know, like we said. Oh. What did we say? What did we... - Being... - Being... - ...the best... - The best... - ...magic... - Magician. - ...Magic Mitch... - ...Magic Mitch... - ...I can. - ...I can. Being the best magician I can be. Yes, I said it. Right. Truth. Honesty. Being the real you. That's where the magic is. Otherwise, what's the point? Hey, what's that? Oh, yeah, it's just a rash. I mean, probably from all that chlorine in those pools. You should probably get that checked out... not yet. This show ain't over. We still gotta make that grandma reappear. Mm-hmm. Pretty rabbit. Uh, I'll be right back. I think I turned the grandma into a rabbit. Vance won't be giving us any problems from here on out. Right now, Vance is the very least of our problems. Finally! Where have you been? Uh, magic show, long story. You remember my Uncle Magic Mitch? Straight jacket? This is some venue. Whoa, yeah. Where's Vance? Shouldn't he be setting up? That's what I've been calling about. There is no Vance. He just freaked out, I don't know why. No, he's probably just taking selfies and then liking them. No, I mean, he's gone, melted down, as in not coming back... ever. Perfect. Far from it. If we don't find someone to take Vance's place, there's not gonna be a Splash-apalooza. And if there's no Splash-apalooza, there's not gonna be a water park next summer. Mattis was so mad, he fired Sheldon. Oh my gosh, no way, no. Why, Sheldon? He loves that job. We need something big. Something amazing. Something... Yeah! Oh... Magical. Does he do something other than sparkle? You bet he does. I think. This is gonna be great. I have so many ideas. Come on, come on, come on, let's do this. Oh, yeah! It's magic hour! Let's go! Yes, yes, yes, let's go, Uncle Mitch. What? Looks like it's been hit by... A clone-ado. Uh, I mean, like a... like a cyclone. What? Hold on. Huh? Ow! What the... Adam, are you okay in there? Yeah, it's just some stomach issues. You've gotta stop eating those son of tuna melts. Brutal. I tried to stop him, but he was too perfect. Plus his hair's breathtaking. I was mesmerized. He's mad. You need to protect Lori. You do not want to go in there. I'm telling you, there's some serious toilet suction. Should I be worried? Uh, no, no. It's just... uh, mice. Big mice. We should go. Adam! What's going on? Well just... stay here, the llama will protect you. Help! I need a little help here, dude. Party foul. He over-powdered me. Perfect? Totally. Oh, oh, Adam, Adam. Where is he? He took off after I showed him the video. Adam, you need to see this. Adam, are you coming back? Hang on, I'll be back. I'll be right in. And I thought my house was messy. Yum, gummy bear. Ha-ha! Lori! Hey! I have to get you out of here. Adam, there was a hand. Oh, a hand? Oh, those mice must be evolving. We have to hurry. Look, Adam! What up? It's Lori. Hey. Oh, no, it's okay, it's okay, they won't hurt you. They're... they're with me. They're... well... Nice to meet your acquaintance. They're my clones. Clones? But that's not real, except in sci-fi movies. I know it's hard to believe, but there was this machine. And my schedule was like crazy... Oh, wait, you mean you did this yourself? No, it was an accident... at first. But instead you lied and then let them run around pretending to be you? You! You smashed cake in my face. And you, you read me poetry and then gave me food poisoning. And you, you just need to do everyone a favor and get that thing waxed! And you. You made a fool of me. All this time, like... like I was some game to you. And to think, I thought you were different. Lori, wait. I know I've been an idiot. I was scared. Scared I wouldn't say the right thing or, you know, be cool enough. Thanks to you, you showed me that the real Adam might not be so bad after all. If you just give me one more chance, I promise I'll never pretend to be someone I'm not ever again. I just... I... I really wanted to im... to impress you. Adam! Uh! I gotcha, I gotcha. Hurry, let's get him to the couch. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. I don't know what's going on. It's the machine, Adam. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Here. It's been 67 hours since the last duplicate was created. Each copy has manifested different traits. Exhibit one. Exhibit two. Each clone exhibits a shared sense of feeling. Even shared pain. No way! Ah! Scientific research, don't you think, boys and girls? That's not the part. Here. Mysterious side effects have surfaced. The headaches, the sweating and dizziness. And now a rash. Oh, nasty. If my analysis is correct, complete bodily disintegration will occur just eight hours after the initial onset of these symptoms. Further, each of my copies will suffer the same fate shortly after my own expiration. The only way to stop the cycle is with the duplex ignitor. Inserting the duplex ignitor in reverse position creates a protonic window through which each clone can be sent back into the initial subject. To do this, each clone must travel into the machine at a high speed, at no less than 37 miles per hour. That's good. We should do that. This is our only hope. Professor Loin signing off possibly for the last time. Van's packed, let's get this show... Uncle Mitch. road. I can explain. Nephew, what have you done? Busted. This is brilliant. What? We can use them in the show. Yeah, we can rage the magic show! We're gonna magic history. What? No, no, no, no, Uncle Mitch, it's too dangerous. We have to get them back in the tanning bed thing. Or the cloning machine thing... I don't know. Tanning bed? Uh, that might be a problem. What? What happened? It was like this when I came in. I thought Gillian had practiced her karate on it or something. We'll fix it. We'll make a plan. He can't get away with this. You're not alone, Adam. There's just one problem. The duplex ignitor is gone. St importantly, we get the duplex ignitor back. And Uncle Mitch, you can still save the park with a great show. Oh. Yes! All right, guys, we're all gonna be needed for the trick here. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Wait. I can't do the show without her. She's my good luck charm. Now why the slide? Because the professor said that all the clones are gonna need to be traveling at least 37 miles an hour to breech the energy field's outer shell. Yeah. That'... that's it, yeah. And before we take the plunge, we're gonna need the duplex ignitor, which of course Perfect has. How do we know he'll even show up? I know. I can text him to meet me at the show. It should work. He took my phone a long time ago. He'll know it's a trick. It doesn't matter. Lori's his... well, also our... weakness. It's too dangerous. Look at what he did to the machine. He's... he's unpredictable. You're in trouble, Adam. And I wanna help. It's just part of my lifeguard nature. And what about the Clone 2000? Even if we get the duplex ignitor from Perfect, it's not gonna do us any good in this shape. Danny? Sheldon? You came, too! I figured you weren't talking to me since... I kind of got you fired. None of that matters right now. You're in trouble, and we're your wing men. Plus, we helped create this mess, too. Word to that. So... you think you can fix it? Uh, yeah. But it's gonna take a lot of duct tape... and technical genius, of course. All right, we gotta go. The show starts in a couple of hours. We'll load the machine into the van. You guys gotta get it running during the show. Show time, whoo-hoo! Oh, my goodness gracious, that was awesome sauce, Todd. Thank you. Let's give it up for the guy who stacked a bunch of cups. Uncle Mitch, why are you hiding? Listen to 'em. They think they're gonna see some young rock star. But you're like hashtag greatest magician ever. Just pretend like you're doing the trick only for me, just like we practiced. You're right. We've got magic to make. Oh, um... due to unforeseen circumstances that were neither unforeseen nor circumstantial, the role of Vance Vance Revolution in tonight's performance will be played by a great performer. Vance! Vance! Vance! Vance! Straight off his one-week stint at the Beachwood Retirement Home, please put your hands together for the one, the only... Magic Mitch! I heat up, I can't cool down You got me spinnin' 'round and 'round 'Round and 'round and 'round it goes Where it stops nobody knows Every time you call my name I heat up like a burnin' flame Burnin' flame full of desire Kiss me baby, let the fire get higher Abra-abra-cadabra I want to reach out and grab ya Abra-abra-cadabra Abracadabra You make me hot, you make me sigh You make me laugh With the touch of a velvet glove Abra-abra-cadabra I want to reach out and grab ya Number one party! Yeah, let's get the party started! Five! Yes! Magic Mitch! I gotta go, excuse me. Okay. We did it! We did it! Thank you so much. Thank you. Every dollar counts. What do I have to do to get you back here next summer? Lots of money. Lori! There you are. Uncle Mitch did it. You guys were amazing. Mattis is going nuts. You've changed already. Yeah, I gotta get you out of here. What? Why? I'll explain on the way. Adam, where are we going? What about our plan? There's been a change in plans. Ah! Oh, there's the man of the hour. Amazing job, Baker. It looks like you really did save the park. Thanks. Have you seen Lori? Uh, she was just with you. You were walking towards the exit. What? Oh, Baker... Baker, come on, how'd you do it? Huh, it was mirrors, right? It had to be mirrors. Clones. Clones? That's funny. Boy, if that was possible, huh? Do me a favor, make that out to Ms. Penny Pants, will ya? Gillian, Gillian, Gillian. You have to kick me. Okay, sure. Ah! Oh! Oooh! Baker, what's the matter with you? Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, that was seriously low. He just wants to get rid of me. Adam doesn't deserve you, Lori, you belong with me. No! You don't know what you're doing. Yes, I do. What? No, no. Oh. Ah. Guys, he's here. And Lori's leading him to the top of the slide. Be careful, Adam. Guys, we're out of time. We gotta get that thing working now. Uh. Copy that. Oh. Well, well, well. If it isn't Adam Baker... all by his lonesome. You think you pulled off your little magic act? Vance, I don't have time for this. This is my park, Baker. You think I'm gonna let you and your gang of robo Adams scare me away? Hear me? How are we doing down there? We're not ready. She's gotta stall him. You gotta stall him. Ah! You disappoint me, Lori. Adam thinks if he can get rid of me and the rest of us, then you'll finally settle for him. I wouldn't be settling. The real Adam's great just the way he is. Yeah, you didn't think that until we brought him to your attention. I guess I needed to open my eyes. Uh. Give me that. Adam! Help! Lori, hang on! Wait a minute. That's the guy I should be fighting. Yeah, exactly. Come on, we have to save her. I can't hold on! Ah! Here, just give me that ignitor and I'll pull you right up, okay? No way! You choose the wrong Adam once, Lori. Don't do it again, just give me the ignitor. Come on. I'm gonna fall! I can't... I can't hold on! Come on, let's go, let's go! Yeah, right. That's, uh, really high up there. Maybe you should take this one, bro. What? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got a... I got a thing about heights. It's embarrassing but... nobody's perfect after all, right? Go 'em, Baker! You got this, man! This is all you! Here you go! Two more flights! Come on, just give me your hand. Okay, you're gonna be there all day if you don't give me your hand. All right, that's it! There you go, that's it! If you don't give me your hand... Ow! I'm not going back. This should be my life, not yours. It is your life. We're a team. Adam! Just go, I got this. Got it! Nice catch! Now fire it up. Hurry! You're on, Adam! Ah! What? How'd you do that? Yah! Ah! - Ah! - Ah! Why'd I do that? On guard, geek. We're good to go. It's working, and it hasn't exploded... yet. Come on, Adam! I know you can do this! Uh, you're holding me back. I don't wanna fight you. Good. Just give up. Ugh! There. Ah! Hold on! Hold on, I got you! What are you doing? I would've never saved you. Yeah, I know. What? No...! It worked! Sorry. Nobody's perfect. Oh, no, you gotta be kidding. Uh! Adam, give me your hand. Pull! Ha-ha, way to go, Bakers! Nice save! Uh, okay. Okay. That's a... ribs breaking. Ribs breaking. That's too tight. Thanks, bud. Good boy. Okay, that was hard. I thank you guys all enough for all you've done for me. Seriously. Not for you, for us. Well... I guess this is it. Just promise me you read a book every once in a while... in between comics. This is for you. And write some poetry. Trust me. See ya. That's not what that is. Never mind. Thanks. Huh? Ooh. Ah! Hug it out, brah. Thanks for teaching me how to have fun, man. Word to that, A Prime. Word to that. Ah! Whoo! I'm gonna go. All right. Keep it real, brah! Gotta split! Whoo! I think I'm gonna miss you most of all. I'm not going anywhere, Adam. We'll be right here whenever you need us. Separately, we're pretty good. But together, we totally rock. Just try not to forget we're there, all right? Never. Look on the bright side. They didn't go very far. And... I'm still here. I mean, I feel different... better. They showed me there was more to Adam Baker than I even knew. Adam, there is one more thing I really have to know. I was right. Some things really can be perfect. No, no, no! That was not a dream! No, that wasn't a dream. What? No. No, no, you cannot do this to me. It was real, I felt it. Hi, kids! Hey, guys, we're home. Adam, where are ya? It's neat. Too neat. How can something be too neat? I'm a mother, trust me. There you are. Hey. Hey? That's it? Well, have you ever had something so amazingly great happen that... you kinda thought that it might not have actually happened? When we had you, sweetie. Mwah. Oh, your Uncle Mitch is in the driveway. He wants to say goodbye. Goodbye? Oh! Hey, Uncle Mitch, where are you going? Vegas, baby. A video of the show went viral. Hashtag Magic Mitch is trending through the roof! I got my magic mojo back thanks to you. Or should I say thanks to all of you. Well you're a pretty awesome uncle. Thanks for saving my butt back there before mom and dad came home. No problem. And cleaned up that mess. That's some real magic. I'm gonna miss you. I promised your boss that I'd be back for an encore appearance every summer. Whoa! Oh, I got something for you. Whoa! For your safe keeping. Whoa. If it were to get into the wrong hands... nah, I don't wanna think about that. I've got the actual tanning bed in my van. Gotta keep this puppy bronzed after all. Well, don't worry, I'll keep it safe. Thanks, Uncle Mitch. All right. Farewell, nephew. Stay magical. All right. I thought you were at work today. Mattis was so thrilled with the fundraiser, he gave me the day off. Oh, and they had to put a new plaque on the trophy with your name over one of Vance's. I bet he loved that. I think it was his idea, actually. Oh, and Sheldon got his job back. No way, that's awesome. I was thinking about hitting the park. You got time? I've always got time for you. And so what do you wanna hit first? Uh, it's your turn to hit Plank Plunge. I think I've spent enough time over there. Yeah, me, too. How 'bout the kiddie pool? Ew! Hey, sweetie, did you miss us? Hi, daddy. Hashtag sisters. Ha! Honey, where are you? There's a llama in the backyard. How many are there?
