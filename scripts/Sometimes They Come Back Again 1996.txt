[WOMAN] ARCHER CONTINUES TO PESTER ME ABOUT HER DEATH-- I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT CRAZY OLD MAN. HE ASKS ME ABOUT AN OLD WATCH LISA WAS WEARING WHEN SHE DIED. I CAN'T REMEMBER THERE BEING ANY OLD WATCH WHEN THEY FOUND THE BODY. [MICHELLE] GOOD MORNING. THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT LONGER WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN THROUGH HALF OF THESE ROOMS YET. LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. I'M HAPPY TO DO IT. I JUST DON'T REALLY WANT TO SPEND WHERE'S THAT WATCH YOU WERE WEARING THE OTHER NIGHT? THAT NECKLACE? UM... IT'S... HA! I CAN'T REMEMBER. OH, GREAT.

YOU KEEP THEM FOR A WHILE BECAUSE YOU MAY NEED TO USE THEM AGAIN. WELL...THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME. [ARCHER] HELLO, JON. HELLO, FATHER. CHANGE YOUR MIND? YOU WERE CALLING MY MOTHER BEFORE SHE DIED. SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HER DEATH? THE SABBATH APPROACHES. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THEM AWAY. FATHER. NO! STAND BACK! OH, THE SPIRI INDEED IS WILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK... AND SO MY BLOOD IS GROWING WEAK, AND THEY KNOW THAT. WHO KNOWS THAT? DO YOU BELIEVE IN HUMAN EVIL, JON? I BELIEVE PEOPLE SOMETIMES LOSE THEIR WAY. WHAT A VERY THOUGHTFUL ANSWER. YOU MUST FEEL SO VERY SAFE ALL THA PSYCHOANALYTICAL BLATHERSKITE. HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL, SEE NO EVIL. IS THA HOW THEY TEACH PSYCHOLOGY TODAY? NOW, SEE THIS. "DOMINATUS..." HAD NO SALOMON DOMINION OVER DEMONS? NO DOUBT HE TRIED. THE REWARDS ARE... IMPOSSIBLY TEMPTING. 30 YEARS AGO, YOU INTERRUPTED A CABALISTIC SABBATH. YOUR SISTER WASN'T JUST MURDERED. SHE WAS SACRIFICED AS PART OF A DEMONIC RITUAL. THE REAL ONES ARE VERY RARE. THEY'RE VERY HARD TO TRACK. EXACTLY WHEN THE CABALISTIC SABBATH OCCURS, WHICH MAKES THE TASK AT HAND... VERY DIFFICULT. YES, I CAN SEE THAT. YOU ALREADY SUSPEC THAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS TRUE. YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE IF YOU DIDN'T. LET ME MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR TO YOU, JON. YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM THIS. THIS EVIL WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO. IT ALREADY HAS. IF YOU WAN TO STOP IT, YOU MUST CUT IT OFF AT THE SOURCE, GO BACK TO WHERE IT ALL STARTED. BUT HE DIED. THEY ALL DIED! I SAW I WITH MY OWN EYES. A POORLY EXTINGUISHED FIRE IS QUICKLY REIGNITED. YOU MUST HAVE SOMEHOW ALLOWED THEM TO DIE. UNLESS THEY DIE BY YOUR HAND, AND TAKE YOU AND EVERYONE CLOSE TO YOU WITH THEM. HE'S COME BACK TO FINISH WHAT YOU INTERRUPTED, JON, AND EACH TIME HE KILLS, HE CAN BRING BACK ANOTHER OF HIS MINIONS YOU'RE SAYING I HAVE TO COMMI MURDER. YOU WON'T BE COMMITTING MURDER, JON. THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD. THAT BOOK WILL SHOW YOU SOME OF WHA YOU NEED TO KNOW. TAKE IT WITH YOU. THE BEAST WILL WORK THROUGH THE BLOODLINE AND SACRIFICE ON THE SABBATH OF THE 18th YEAR. HE KILLED LISA WHEN SHE WAS 18, JON, AND HE KILLED YOUR MOTHER SO YOU'D BRING MICHELLE TO HIM. IF YOU THINK MY MOTHER WAS KILLED, TELL ME WHO DID IT. A MAN NAMED JIM NORMAN WAS THE LAST MAN I HEARD OF TO VIOLATE THE SABBATH. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, YOU MAY WAN TO CALL ON HIM... UNLESS YOU'D RATHER WAI FOR TONY TO COME KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR. SO YOU BETTER LOOK ALIVE HE'S BUSY REVVING UP THE POWERFUL MACH FIVE HERE HE COMES HERE COMES SPEED RACER HE'S A DEMON ON WHEELS YEP, DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE IT'S HYPER-HYDRAULIC MULCH-MODE TIME. O.K., LET'S DO IT. HERE HE COMES, HERE COMES SPEED RACER AND WHEN THE ODDS ARE AGAINST YOU AND THERE'S DANGEROUS WORK TO DO YOU BET YOUR LIFE SPEED RACER WILL BE THERE TO SEE IT THROUGH [CRUNCH] UH-OH. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE POWERFUL MACH FIVE? OH. LOOKY HERE. A RED SHOE. WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? UGH! I GOT YOU. YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY LIKE THAT. NOW, YOU STAY ON BECAUSE I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT MY HAT. OH, NO! WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? SOMEBODY COME HELP ME... HI, STEVE. I'VE BEEN THINKING. WE NEVER REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. YOU KNOW, I'M NO SUCH A BAD GUY ONCE YOU GE TO KNOW ME. [ENGINE REVVING] [STEVE] NO... HERE'S A QUESTION. IF A GARDENER WITH A BIG MOUTH IS ALONE IN A FIELD BEING TORTURED AND NO ONE'S THERE TO HEAR HIM SCREAM, DOES IT STILL HURT? [STEVE] NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! AAH! URGH! LOOKS TO ME LIKE A BAD HAIR DAY. MIND GIVING ME A HAND? [TONY LAUGHING] [CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [GRUNTING] [VOICES SCREAMING] [GROWLING] WELCOME BACK. WHEN DO WE EAT? YOU DO ONLY WHA I TELL YOU TO DO.

I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT HAD HE BEEN ILL? HE BLED TO DEATH. IT WAS HORRIBLE. I'VE NEVER SEEN A BODY MANGLED LIKE THAT. THERE WAS JUS SO MUCH BLOOD, AND I REALLY MUST SAY, JON, IT WAS SOME OF MY VERY BEST WORK. HE'S BLEEDING LIKE A STUCK PIG IN SUMMERTIME. [NORMAL VOICE] THERE'S NO STOPPING THIS HEAVY FLOW. [RING] [MAN] HELLO. GAZETTE. YES. I'M TRYING TO GET AHOLD OF SOME-- OF SOME, UH, BACK ISSUES. DO YOU HAVE AN ARCHIVES OF SOME SORT? WELL, HOW FAR BACK YOU LOOKING TO GO? UH... ABOUT 30 YEARS. [THUNDER] [ENGINE DOESN'T START] [CIGARETTE LIGHTER LIGHTS] YOU KNOW, JON... IT WASN' VERY NICE OF YOU TO THREATEN MY PAL TONY WITH THAT GREAT BIG FIRE-POKER OF YOURS. [TONY] THAT'S O.K. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT, BUT TELL ME SOMETHING. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT POKER LATELY? I THINK I STUCK I TO MICHELLE. [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECH] [MATCH STRIKES] [THUNDER] [MARIA] KEEP THEM CLOSED.

I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? NOTHING LIKE A BIG, STRONG MAN TO STIR UP A FIRE. WOULD YOU STOP IT? HE'D OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FATHER. GREAT EARRINGS. OH, THANKS. WHERE'D YOU GET THEM? FROM SOMEONE OLDER THAN YOUR FATHER. SO, ANYONE NEED ANYTHING FROM THE KITCHEN? YEAH. NO. AAH! [FLIES BUZZING] DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY EVIDENCE IN THE HOUSE. REALLY? WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS MESS I JUST PUT IN THE GROUND? WELL, SIR, I'D CALL THAT BURIED. EXCUSE ME, BUT THAT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S PET, AND SOMEBODY KILLED I WITH A FIRE-POKER, SO IF YOU COULD FIND THEM, WE'D ALL FEEL SAFER. HERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT PURPOSE IT'LL SERVE COVERED WITH YOUR FINGERPRINTS. THIS HOUSE WAS DELIBERATELY VANDALIZED. THEY LEFT SOME MARK IN THE KITCHEN. WHICH I NOTICED YOU CLEANED UP. I WANT TO KNOW WHO DID THIS! I ALSO WANT A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS AND ANY CONNECTION IT MIGHT HAVE TO MY MOTHER'S DEATH. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR? ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT MRS. PORTER WAS MURDERED, SIR? I'M SUGGESTING YOU LOOK INTO IT. [JON] COMMINGLE THE BLOOD AND SACRIFICE THE GIRL IN HER 18th YEAR. LET LIFE LEAVE HER BODY AT MIDNIGH AND EAT HER STILL-BEATING HEART, THUS ASSUMING THE POWER OF THE BEAST. [ARCHER] HE'S COME BACK TO FINISH WHAT YOU INTERRUPTED, JON. HE CAN BRING BACK ANOTHER OF HIS MINIONS UNLESS YOU STOP HIM. [JON] THE FALSE PROPHE MAY SEVER A DIGI TO KEEP THE LATCH CLOSED...
