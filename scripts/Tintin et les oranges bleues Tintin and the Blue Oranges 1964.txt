We should say straight away that this is no ordinary book. Firstly because of the well-known nature of Professor Calculus. . . Firstly because of the well-known nature of Professor Calculus. . . Has it started? Yes, Professor, it's started. . . er. . .on the other hand, because of the very problem addressed by the book, and which concerns all of us - the problem of hunger. Professor Calculus' book is, on the contrary, a passionate book, Professor Calculus' book is, on the contrary, a passionate book, a sort of generous appeal to the world's conscience, so that it helps to find a solution to this dramatic situation where every day in the world thousands of men and women are dying of hunger. That's right, isn't it, Professor? Not at all! Not at all! Absolutely not, young man! It's not a novel. The book is an appeal. The development of the deserts and the cultivation of arid soils is the only solution. The future of humanity will be guaranteed the day we are able to grow oranges in the Sahara will be guaranteed the day we are able to grow oranges in the Sahara and potatoes at the North Pole. I am launching an appeal to scientists the world over I am launching an appeal to scientists the world over to unite and focus - as a matter of priority, don't you think? - on this problem on which the future of humanity depends. . . on this problem on which the future of humanity depends. . . I hope that Professor Calculus's noble appeal will be heard. Nestor! Nestor! My whisky! Nestor! My whisky! . . .and the result of their experiments. . . . . .and the result of their experiments. . . But it's the Professor! . . .and the solidarity of all men of science. . . A few days later at Marlinspike. . . Tintin, file this one as well under ''of some interest''. There we are. . . Tintin, file this one as well under ''of some interest''. There we are. . . Captain? Professor, your appeal has roused all of the world's madmen - look! What, Snowy? This parcel? What do we have here? ''Professor Za-la-me-a. . .'' What? What? ''. . . Hacienda. . .'' ''. . . Hacienda. . .'' Give it to me, give it to me! ''Professor Zalamea, Hacienda Bello Horizonte, Valencia. . .''. Professor Zalamea, one of the greatest names in modern science! Zalamea, rival of the great Vladimir Rataputchin, who for many years who for many years has been working on the selection of new plant species. . . Come on. . . Come on. . . Really, my dear Cuthbert! Come on. . . Come on. . . Really, my dear Cuthbert! You know very well how clumsy you are! Cursed string! A blue ball. . . Look, they're sending toys now. Madmen, I tell you! It looks like an orange! A blue orange! It looks like an orange! A blue orange! No, no! It's an orange, a blue orange! No, no! It's an orange, a blue orange! It's no doubt the outcome It's no doubt the outcome of Zalamea's work on the adaptation of citrus plants to desert soils. Oh, a blue orange! Oh, a blue orange! Very curious, certainly, but scientifically speaking, not incredible. but scientifically speaking, not incredible. No doubt the adaptation to desert soil produces a mutation in colour. What I find surprising though, Captain, is that there wasn't any letter with the parcel. . . The blue orange. . . We're going to eat this blue orange. It will be a change from Nestor's eternal stewed pears. The blue orange! The blue orange! You want to eat the blue orange, Captain? No, I'm joking, Tintin. . . I don't want to eat that orange, bleugh! It's just to tease our dear Cuthbert a little bit. . . Ah! Nestor, bring us the blue orange! Nestor, bring us the blue orange! But Captain, the Professor himself placed the orange in the refrigerator. And he forbade me from touching it. NESTOR! THE ORANGE! Sir! Sir! Sir! The orange! Bah, what's the matter?! Put it down there. Bah, what's the matter?! Put it down there. But sir, the orange lights up! Really my old friend, you must be mad. Really my old friend, you must be mad. But in the corridor - sir knows how dark it is - the orange lit up. Maybe it's phosphorescent? Maybe it's phosphorescent? What!? My orange?! I forbade you from touching my orange! I forbade you! Quick Nestor, turn out the light! Quick Nestor, turn out the light! Really, Captain. . . A thousand thundering typhoons! As sir says. As sir says. A fluorescent orange! It's disturbing, certainly, but scientifically speaking, not incredible. It's no doubt the Cerenkov Effect. It's no doubt the Cerenkov Effect. Oh, oh, sir, sir, listen to this noise. What's going on? Oh, blistering barnacles, I can't see a thing! It's an assassination, I can't see a thing! Captain! Over here! Help! Up lads and at 'em! Sir, oooooh! Too late! Plagues! Plagues! Ostrogoths! Centipedes! Bashi-bazouks! Nestor! Quick! Reset the fuses! But. . . What happened here? Oh, the vandals! The iconoclasts! The drunkards! Captain! Captain! They stole the blue orange! Ah, well. . . Ah, well. . . Good morning, Tintin. Good morning, Captain. Slept well I hope? Slept well I hope? Accursed ectoplasm. . . Professor, we may as well tell you straight away. . . The blue orange - the blue orange has been taken. No, no, no, no, not cake. No, no, toast please, as usual. No, no, no, no, not cake. No, no, toast please, as usual. Professor. . . Last night. . . While you were sleeping. . . THE BLUE ORANGE WAS STOLEN. Now, don't shout like that. I am not deaf! Now, don't shout like that. I am not deaf! But you, Captain, are very talkative, you know. You do nothing but talk, and talk all the time about the blue orange - it's a secret, you know! Thundering typhoons! Thundering typhoons! I am telling you that THE BLUE ORANGE IS NO MORE! Huh? Pardon? GONE! GONE! You were saying. . .? THE BLUE ORANGE! VANISHED! KIDNAPPED! What!? What!? Now then, am I to understand that the blue orange was stolen last night? Now then, am I to understand that the blue orange was stolen last night? If that's what you're trying to say, Captain, tell me frankly, and don't beat about the bush. . . tell me frankly, and don't beat about the bush. . . Oooooooh nooo! The blue orange stolen? No, no, it's not possible. No, it's another one of the Captain's jokes, isn't it? No, Professor, it's not a joke. No, Professor, it's not a joke. I have already tried to call Professor Zalamea. A highly rare mutant specimen! A scientific deposit of capital importance! You must warn Professor Zalamea, mm? My reputation is ruined, ruined! It's a catastrophe, a catastrophe! Now really, my dear Cuthbert, surely you exaggerate the importance of this piece of fruit. . . It's inexplicable, inexplicable! It's inexplicable, inexplicable! What a vexation! What an affront! What a curse! But Cuthbert, you are. . . But where is the little elf going? But Cuthbert, you are. . . But where is the little elf going? I'm going straight away to find the famous Professor Zalamea. Come now, Cuthbert. I must warn him without delay. A billion blistering barnacles! Stop moving around like that. You're making me dizzy. You're making me dizzy. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! There's not a minute to lose! Quick! Quick! Stealing an orange. . . It's a bit surprising all the same. . . Yes, but this orange was blue, and sent by a very great scientist whose research is known by all the specialists. It can only be a case of scientific theft. . . What I don't understand is that the parcel arrived without a word of explanation. is that the parcel arrived without a word of explanation. I must leave immediately for Professor Zalamea's laboratory to tell him that the blue orange has been stolen! Captain, the three of us are going to Valencia. Captain, the three of us are going to Valencia. I mean, the four of us. What? To Valencia!? Alone! I will go alone. Alone! I will go alone. That is my decision, since there is no respect for science here! Captain, quick, catch him! Oh! Hey! Professor! Professor. . . And why not? The beautiful Andalusian women, the manzanilla sherry, and then the flamenco. . . the manzanilla sherry, and then the flamenco. . . Hey, Professor, wait for me! Wait for me, Cuthbert! TAKING NEXT PLANE TO VALENCIA - STOP BLUE ORANGE SEN EXPRESS PROFESSOR CALCULUS STOLEN - STOP BLUE ORANGE SEN EXPRESS PROFESSOR CALCULUS STOLEN - STOP TINTIN Well, let's go. There you are, Professor, we're here. What can I do for you? This is, er. . . Professor Calculus, Captain Haddock and Tintin. - Very good - And Snowy! - Very good - And Snowy! - Quick, let's go in. . . - No, no. . . Professor. - Quick, let's go in. . . - No, no. . . Professor. But I want to see Professor Zalamea! A little patience, Cuthbert, we've been announced! A little patience, Cuthbert, we've been announced! And in fact I think I see Professor Zalamea now coming to welcome us. - Yes, yes. - Come on, let's go. Welcome, gentlemen, welcome to the Hacienda Bello Horizonte, welcome. Please be so kind as to come in. Pray, be seated, gentlemen, be seated. Your arrival is both an honour and a surprise. A surprise? You didn't receive our telegram? A surprise? You didn't receive our telegram? No, nothing was given to me. I don't understand it. We sent it before we left, yesterday morning, and yet we must have had the right address, Professor Zalamea, and yet we must have had the right address, Professor Zalamea, since here we are. Professor, me? Oh, no, Mr Tintin, no. Let me introduce myself - Oh, no, Mr Tintin, no. Let me introduce myself - I am simply Don Lopez de Zalamea de Rodriguez Zaropa Losa Rabia y Peredon. de Rodriguez Zaropa Losa Rabia y Peredon. I am the cousin of the illustrious Professor Zalamea. And since it is he you have come to see, I will call for him. Estensoro! Forward! Estensoro, go and get my cousin in the laboratory. Yes, and I'm surprised my cousin didn't let me know you were coming. But he must have received our telegram! It is true, sir, that our decision to come was very sudden. Ah, yes. . . Sir, the Professor is not in his laboratory. Oh, I'm surprised. My cousin is not in his laboratory. Let's go and see. This way, if you please. Come, sir. Are you coming, Captain? Are you coming, Captain? Er, yes. I'm coming! I'm coming! How does it go? Right, there, there. . . Antenor Zalamea is a great scientist, and like many great scientists, and like many great scientists, he is a little - how would you put it? - eccentric. He virtually never leaves his laboratory. He virtually never leaves his laboratory. I have his meals brought here - if I didn't he would forget to eat, and he won't sleep anywhere else. if I didn't he would forget to eat, and he won't sleep anywhere else. Yes, of course, Professor Calculus also has his little habits. . . The blue oranges! I have a cousin. . . He goes for long walks. . . I have a cousin. . . He goes for long walks. . . It's marvellous, marvellous. . . He goes for long walks. He says he has to let his ideas breathe. He says he has to let his ideas breathe. In any case, it's good for his health. He will be back for dinner. He will be back for dinner. May I ask you to wait for him? Oh, yes indeed. Of course I would be happy to offer you gentleman our hospitality for the night. our hospitality for the night. Thank you very much, Don Lopez. We don't want to take advantage. . . But it would be a great pleasure for me. Well, then. . . Eh, are you coming Professor? Yes, yes, yes! Of course. It's marvellous. And that evening, at the Hacienda Bello Horizonte. . . It seems that Professor Calculus has disappeared. It seems that Professor Calculus has disappeared. He doesn't drink coffee? As soon as we got up from the table, he ran off to Professor Zalamea's laboratory. He seems enthralled by your cousin's work. He seems enthralled by your cousin's work. - A cigar? - No, thank you. The blue oranges. . . Oh, what marvels! Phosphorescent gammatrophism, isn't it? I am worried - and sorry for your sake - that my cousin hasn't yet returned. Yes. Listen! . . . But that's Snowy! Snowy, Snowy! Snowy has been chloroformed! What, oh no, oh no - a kidnapping in my own house! But. . . Maybe they also kidnapped Professor Zalamea. . . Maybe they also kidnapped Professor Zalamea. . . Oh, I am overwhelmed with horror. . . But yes, that must be it, there's no other explanation for his lateness. Quickly, we must warn all of my men. Estensoro, call everybody. We are organising a search. We must tell the police. We must tell the police. If these spider monkeys touch even one of the hairs that are usually under this little hat. . . I'll disembowel them! I'll disembowel them! I'll skin them alive! And I'll hang them from the highest cross-mast! And I'll hang them from the highest cross-mast! Snowy! Snowy! Meanwhile, in an old abandoned church. . . Will you stop this car?! Where are you going? Where are we? Hey! Where are you going? Where are we? Hey! What does that mean! Will you stop?! Stop, I say! You ill bred men! Completely. Will you let me go?! I am Professor Calculus! Will you let me go?! I am Professor Calculus! Let me go, let me go! I am Professor Calculus. Let me go, let me go! I am Professor Calculus. I'm telling you to let me go, you bandits! Nasty bandits! Now you're hurting me. Let me go now. Quiet, quiet, old goat. Quiet, quiet, old goat. Get your paws off me! Sir, here is the new prisoner. Professor, we were obliged to kidnap you. You were too curious. No harm will come to you on the condition that you help Professor Zalamea with his work. His research must be concluded as soon as possible. His research must be concluded as soon as possible. As soon as it is finished, As soon as it is finished, we will set you free and compensate you generously. Be careful, though. Be careful, though. If you do not wish to cooperate, we can also be extremely nasty. No no. . . but I'm telling you. . . I am Professor Calculus! I am Professor Cuthbert Calculus! Ah, don't push me, don't push me, do you understand?! Go, down there, go. Go, down there, go. Professor Zalamea, you have a visitor. Oh! Professor Calculus, I believe. I am Professor Zalamea. I am Professor Zalamea. You are. . .you are Professor Zalamea? You are. . .you are Professor Zalamea? Yes. Oh! I am Professor Calculus! Oh, it's a great pleasure for me, sir. . . Oh, it's a great pleasure for me, sir. . . Oh, it's a great honour for me, Professor. . . What is it? What is it? Let me introduce the Big Boss. The Big Boss? The Big Boss. . . The Big Boss. . . He's the representative of a powerful group that wants exclusive rights to my discoveries. Between us, my dear, I'm leading them a merry dance, and to buy time. . . I'm doing a bit of tinkering. . . But that has nothing to do with the blue oranges. Oh, the blue oranges! Oh, the blue oranges! I sent you the first one, and they stole it from you. The five others have grown since I was kidnapped. Because this new species of orange, treated with my special process, Because this new species of orange, treated with my special process, reaches full maturity in five days. - Five days! - Five days! - But that's marvellous! - Yes. - But that's marvellous! - Yes. Sabotage. The important thing is to submit the seeds to the appropriate neutron bombardment. is to submit the seeds to the appropriate neutron bombardment. And it's very simple. I'll explain it to you. . . But it's just as I thought, Professor. The neutron bombardment leads then to a mutation of the species. . . The neutron bombardment leads then to a mutation of the species. . . Yes. . . .and the orange becomes blue, and what's more, phosphorescent, . . .and the orange becomes blue, and what's more, phosphorescent, with a prodigious growth rate! Yes. Yes. An annoying detail, however, which I didn't mention, Professor, is that the blue orange in its current state is not yet edible - it has a bitter taste and is horribly salty. . . Here, would you like to. . .? Oh, thank you. . . Oh, thank you. . . Ah, yes, clearly, very bitter. . . Professor Zalamea, you are engaged in sabotage! You are interfering with the audibility of your conversations - it's unacceptable! it's unacceptable! If, in 48 hours time, I do not have proof that your work is progressing, I will make you cry like babies! Oh, I have an idea. . . Oh, I have an idea. . . Confiscated! Confiscated! Don't worry, Professor. To regain our freedom, we still have this. To regain our freedom, we still have this. No, no. I have no comments for the press. No, no. Do you have any clues? Any leads you can give us? Say something, sir! Anything! Oh, no. . . No. . . That's enough! We're done! Oh, no. . . No. . . That's enough! We're done! Captain, not a word about the blue orange. . . Captain, not a word about the blue orange. . . Come now, my dear Tintin, who do you take me for?! - I know how to hold my tongue. . . - Yes. There's manners for you! There's manners for you! I'm going to cut your ears into points! As long as my investigation continues, gentlemen, As long as my investigation continues, gentlemen, I have to ask you not to leave the hacienda. But we are guests here, and we were only supposed to stay for a day. I beg you, this house is yours. Stay as long as you please. I beg you, this house is yours. Stay as long as you please. Thank you very much, Don Lopez. Yes, yes, it won't be long anyway. With me and Tintin here, the mystery of the blue oranges will soon be cleared up. . . Ooooh! the mystery of the blue oranges will soon be cleared up. . . Ooooh! The mystery of the blue oranges? The captain means the oranges that grow beneath the blue Valencian sky. - Yes. . . - The captain is a poet. A poet? A poet? Yes, a poet. . . The blue sky, the blue oranges, the Andalusian sun. . . the Andalusian sun. . . Huh? What? Species of vermicelli! Ectoplasm! Ectoplasm! Gherkin! Water-lily! Confounded cataplasm! Confounded cataplasm! Right now, I must leave. I will return tomorrow. You can leave now. You can leave now. Put the crate here, and go and play. Put the crate here, and go. No. Put the crate here, and go. Go and play, now. Aha, Tintin and Snowy! Is this your marble? Yes. I am a great friend of Professor Zalamea. My name is Pablito. Delighted, Pablito. What did you say? You're a friend of Professor Zalamea? Yes, yes. I know who captured Professor Zalamea and your friend Professor Calculus. You know who kidnapped the two Professors? You know who kidnapped the two Professors? Hello! Aha, Captain Haddock! Quick, Captain, I think we're onto a good lead, don't you? We must leave here! Come on. Come on. Be quiet, Snowy. Quiet, quiet! Be quiet, Snowy. Be quiet, ducks, or I'll twist your necks. You should see yourself, you're both covered in dust! Quick, quick! Quick, quick! Come in, come in. Wait here a moment. Really, your blasted Pablito. Quiet, Captain. Quiet, Captain. It looks like he's completely forgotten us! Someone's coming. Someone's coming? Well, I'm taking my own precautions, hm? I don't know if it's the dust or the emotion. I'm telling you no! I'm telling you yes! I'm telling you yes! Calm down, calm down. What is your name? What is your name? My name is Francesito. Ah, hello, Francesito. And thanks to all of you. Ah, hello, Francesito. And thanks to all of you. But this little ship boy speaks French! Give me a hug! Give me a hug! Give me a hug! Give me a hug! My mother is French. Ah. Ah. Pablito knows things. Professor Zalamea is his friend. Every week he goes to the Hacienda for deliveries with his father. Professor Zalamea is very fond of playing marbles. Professor Zalamea is very fond of playing marbles. He always has a game with Pablito. But last week, Professor Zalamea gave Pablito a letter and a parcel. He was supposed to take them to the post office, He was supposed to take them to the post office, and above all not to say anything to anyone! A letter! So there was a letter. A letter! So there was a letter. Yes, but that's the thing, when Pablito was going towards the post office when Pablito was going towards the post office with the letter and parcel, in a deserted street, he was suddenly attacked by a man, a man who beat him half to death and took the letter and parcel. But Pablito didn't take it lying down. But Pablito didn't take it lying down. He held on to him and punched and kicked him. He cried out and people came out of their houses He cried out and people came out of their houses and the man had to run away quickly. But the parcel had rolled into the gutter. Pablito picked it up and went quickly to the post office. Pablito picked it up and went quickly to the post office. But the letter had disappeared. Thanks to this letter, Zalamea's enemies found out our address and were able to take the blue orange that was in the parcel. and were able to take the blue orange that was in the parcel. Pablito, we absolutely must find the man who attacked you. Pablito, we absolutely must find the man who attacked you. Describe him as exactly as possible. Black hair, black eyes, black moustache. And his height - er, big? Little? Little? Ah, medium, that doesn't solve anything, mm? You don't remember any more precise details? You don't remember any more precise details? Something we could identify him with, Pablito? Something we could identify him with, Pablito? Ah. Pablito says that when the man was half strangling him with his arm, he saw a dragon tattoo next to his watch. Yes, a blue dragon biting its own tail. Francesito, you and your friends must absolutely find this man again. Francesito, you and your friends must absolutely find this man again. Yes, but how?. First of all, does Pablito's father have a telephone? Yes, he has a telephone at the grocery store. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to split into teams of two. You're going to split into teams of two. You're going to walk around the village and ask the time from all the men who fit the description Pablito gave. That way you can look at their wrist. If you ever find the man with the tattooed dragon, If you ever find the man with the tattooed dragon, one of you can follow him discreetly, and the other can quickly telephone Pablito, and the other can quickly telephone Pablito, who will run here and let us know. Me stay here? Oh, no. I want to come with you. Me stay here? Oh, no. I want to come with you. No, Pablito must stay at the grocery store. Firstly because we need him as a liaising officer. And then because if the man meets him in the street, And then because if the man meets him in the street, he would certainly run away. My word! You'd think you were at a Marlinspike council meeting! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Madame. . . What's up? To telephone, you need five pesetas, and we don't have any pesetas. We don't have anything. We don't have anything. Blistering barnacles! What big thinkers these little heads are! Come here. . . - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you very much. There. . . And there. . . Goodbye, Maria. Good morning, Teresa. Goodbye, Maria. Good morning, Teresa. Please come in. Please come in. You have help, I see. Yes, I have a little boy. He's a very good boy. He takes orders over the telephone. A kilo of capsicum. What would you like? What nice potatoes! Here's some tourists coming. Here's some tourists coming. I can sense that we're onto a lead. . . What's all this noise? Mr Thomson. . . Mr Thompson? No, he's Thompson and I'm Thomson. Interpol. We are here to investigate the disappearance of Professor Calculus. I would say, even, that we're here to investigate the disappearance of Professus Calculor. . . Of Prossefor Caclusul. . . of Professor Calculus. Of Prossefor Caclusul. . . of Professor Calculus. I should inform you, gentlemen, that Tintin, Captain Haddock and Snowy have also disappeared. Don't worry. With us, things will not get out of hand. Don't worry. With us, things will not get out of hand. Look! Yes, yes, yes. What's happening? They found him. Come on! Quick, Captain, it's our turn to play. Quick, Captain, it's our turn to play. Wait for me! Come quickly, Captain, quickly! Come quickly, Captain, quickly! Look, he's going. Run, run. . . Look, he's taking the bus. Where is this man? He took the bus! He took the bus! Listen. See this key? You are going to put it near the shoe-shiner and pretend that he lost it and you need his address. That way you'll find out. That way you'll find out. The gentleman who just left dropped his key. Where does he live? I can give it back to him. That's kind of you. His name is Fernando and he lives at the Red Donkey hotel. His name is Fernando and he lives at the Red Donkey hotel. Ah, yes. Manzanilla! El Senor Fernando. . . Fernando? Yes. Yes. He's not here. Room seven. Estensoro. . . Estensoro. . . Estensoro. . . Don Lopez's steward. Don Lopez's steward. That explains a great deal. . . Fernando here, Fernando to the chief, I'm listening. Chief to Fernando, chief to Fernando, there are new developments.

Blistering barnacles, what do you mean quick, when I was starting to. . . Blistering barnacles, what do you mean quick, when I was starting to. . . I'll explain later. Later. . . I'll explain later. Later. . . Hey, your manzanilla. Shh, Captain, you see that man there, it's Fernando. Let's follow silently. . . Let's follow silently. . . Be careful, gentlemen, the staircase is slippery. What's he saying? Yes, yes, yes. Come in. Come in. Mission accomplished, and tomorrow at dawn. . . . . .we will take them to the old church. . . Ouch. . . Oooh, my head! Captain! Ouch. . . Captain! Oh, dear. . . Blistering barnacles, and me with my fragile head! The torturers, ouch! The cannibals! If I ever find them, I'll bleed them - ouch! Oh, dear - like little lambs, you hear? like little lambs, you hear? Where are we? It's a wheat silo. The only way to get out would be with a rope ladder. Ah, don't ever say that word in front of a sailor, Tintin! Ah, don't ever say that word in front of a sailor, Tintin! It brings bad luck! I'm sorry, but. . . I'm sorry, but. . . Obviously, if we had a bit of rope on hand, it would be a different matter, but we may as well wish for an elevator. The freebooters who imprisoned us in this hell knew what they were doing. The freebooters who imprisoned us in this hell knew what they were doing. We are doomed to die of thirst. Snowy! Snowy! Bravo, Snowy! If you have any good ideas to get us out of here, If you have any good ideas to get us out of here, I promise you a mammoth's bone. Bravo! Thank you, Snowy! That'll hold, go ahead. After you, Captain. No, my boy, go ahead. I shall be the last, yes, the last one to leave the building, I shall be the last, yes, the last one to leave the building, an old sailor's habit.
