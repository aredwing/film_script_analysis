No moving in together. Eventually moving in together. Rheumatism. Eventually children. Miscarriage. Australia. Cuba. South Germans. Japan. Ethics council. Miscarriage. Continue. Therapy. Continue. No sex. Continue. Old age. Continue. Slower. Even slower. Continue. You die. Me too. Why do I die first? Why not? Statistics, you are a man. But you smoke. -Sometimes. You drink. -Nonsense. You are dogmatic. You are dogmatic. I'm totalitarian. True. I thought you'd eventually sleep with me again. Why don't you sleep with me again. I told him his longing for harmony was pathological, that it left nothing but unsolved problems and that he should finally stop always turning a deaf ear and to wish, smile, silence everything away, that he should overcome his laziness... Sorry ... Hey, where are you? I got my period. - So? What? I won't go in the water. Something happened? I guess that means that art cannot take place where a vice chancellor is giving a speech. Yes, possible, isn't it? But it's not the pictures choice, if he is standing before them. No, but there is no art without context. What are you doing? - Working. What? Statics for this cubus, gotta be finished tomorrow. ... yes, I know. And please stop telling me, after 20 years, that my mother wants to kill you and fuck me. But that's how it is. And before she kills me... I cannot concentrate. -Me neither. I'm not really looking, I don't know why. Maybe because of the movie. I'm so warm. God, I'm hot. It's rather cold in here. I'm spontaneously falling into climacterium. Maybe some day you just are too old for cinema. Why is that? - I swear, we are the only ones who cannot keep up with this crap. Hey, granny, gramps, don't you want to continue grumping at home? You see? - I don't see anything! Wednesday,15:10h. Simultaneous thinking, comes without warning. One half of your attention concentrates on wat happens in front of your eyes, or what is being said. The other half thinks of something completely different. Of food or animals or holiday or asian pattern, whatever. Wednesday, 15:11h, I listen to a stem cell researcher named Adam Born and think of... ...that is not yet universally defined. Jeff Koons? Totally ridiculous, is this a sex fantasy? Sexual thoughts in old age compensate rather something like, social anxiety during underground rides, the lack of challenge at bad cultural events, or simply the boredom of dreary lectures, this is something different, this lecture isn't boring, I'm really listening, but at the same time I'm thinking of Jeff Koons. Cognitive bullshit. You think either one or the other. Someone driving a car while making a phone call, either doesn't listen or eventually is going to crash into a tree. Why is there someone else speaking? ... well all this is far too technical for me... So ping pong: Adam Born versus Jeff Koons, 1:1. ... not only remain in blood, but singular stem cells from transplanted organs spread out within the organism, go to other organs and there partially differentiate even further. ... also a pregnant woman is a chimera, because we know, that intact cells of the baby in the womb can breach the otherwise very finely filtering placenta barrier. So it is possible during the months of pregnancy to prove intact fetal cells inside the mother. Well, Hanna. Well, Volker. - And, how? Super. I've seen your show yesterday. Yeah, thanks. I already wanted to tell you some time ago, well... I think your perpetual picking on Dewey is somehow improper. What? I'm not picking on him. Yes, you do! You're saying, he says, aesthetical experience can be experienced, aesthetical experience itself has, so to speak, an immanent self-reflexivity. This is not only disproved, it is also completely counterintuitive. I just have to look at my own ex... ...but it's one of our usual problems, as the Ethics Council, that we often have to deal with scientific developments in its early stages. Well, I just want to remind you, that we don't know, what awaits us, when the chimera research in England takes the leap, like it does indicate in synthetic biology, that you can produce living organisms out of inanimate material, which appears to be pretty adaptable. What happens next, if these on the other hand get combined with other, alien organs within an organism? I would say, that is a pretty interesting question. But your institute has been working for a long time very closely with firms like Pharmaseidon and Bioxern, who certainly have an entirely different interest in this matter. Excuse me, what exactly are we talking about? About the chimera research or the markets? Maybe you could recapitulate your point, Miss Dr. Blum. Well, this here is nothing new for us: the difficulty of a categorisation of "Life". And the fact, that there is an expanding arsenal of spare parts available for our body, doesn't make things any easier. By all means. Yes, and shouldn't this be investigated at first beyond the potentials, the market provides herefor? Yes. Yes. - Of course, however, I'm here to familiarize you with the chimera research, which the British pursue very aggresively and which over here was put on hold, also by the influence of this council. But I don't think, I was invited here to discuss this. Simon? Who actually pinned Gilbert and George here on the wall? You! About hundred years ago. - What? Nonsense. These are your heroes. Way overslept, I have to see the doc. - Oh, yes... Don't forget, today evening at eight o'clock is Wilson! See you later! Oh my god... We have to renovate. Does it hurt? We should not fool ourselves, it looks like a tumour. We check the blood values one more time and determine the tumour markers. It takes one or two days, then we can be sure. Give us a call, ok? Remain calm. There are worse things nowadays. Simon? Do you want to know the figures? Rather not. -We have to talk about it. If soon nothing big comes our way, we're broke. All of our artists are broke, where is the money supposed to come from? Yeah, exactly. Here comes the next vulture of bancruptcy. You have to start saying no. We're not gonna make it. Look at him. How am I supposed to say no? We got ten such boys, you're spoiling. Things are going downhill. We have to acquire new clients. Fancy people. Who sometimes win a contest. Oh, now come on. Do you have a ticket left? Yes, no, I don't know, I... Do you have a mobile? Hey, it's me. Hanna, where are you? I'm not gonna make it. Why aren't you answering the phone now? What's up? -Right now I should be at the theatre. You're not gonna make it. - I won't comment on this. I'll have to leave at half past ten, my mother is coming. Excuse me. Can I make a brief phone call? - No, this one is just in-house. Here. Hello. Yes, may I? Are you a stalker? Do you have a ticket left? Hello, it's me, where the hell are you? I see, I... Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you go often to the theatre? - Actually never, but a friend takes part in the play. ... in death I scream! Thank you. Whose role is she playing? The young poet. Ahh, she's good. You seemed somehow exerted yesterday, didn't you? I beg your pardon? In the ethics council. How do you mean? I don't know, somehow I had this feeling, You did argue, not, because you were against my position, but because you were somehow against me. Why is my verse so barren of new pride, So far from variation or quick change? Why with the time do I not glance aside To new-found methods and to compounds strange? What is your substance, whereof are you made, that millions of strange shadows on you tend? Since every one hath, every one, one shade? I think the texts for themselves are already great, they didn't need any enhancements. But... That's Wilson, maybe you should have went to see Mother Courage, although, there is also a lot of music in it, might be actually a stupid idea. I think, I'll have to go this way. - Okay, so... So, bye. - Bye and thanks again! You're welcome! Bye! Hanna, well, come on! ...somehow anymore, and I had lost the address... Hello Hilde! Tell me, did you go to see the Nibelungen Ring? What? It's two o'clock. Please excuse me, I... I've forgot. What? What's the matter with you? I was really worried. Sorry, sorry, ... - Give it a rest. I have to tell you something. Sit down. I've been to see the doctor. Yesterday. I have pancreatic cancer. I thought so for quite some time. The cancer has advanced to the point that it's no longer possible to operate. You're telling me now? We've been sitting here for three hours. Well, do you think, I will repeat all of this misery from the top? I wanted to wait until Hanna is here. Wait a moment, what? Since when do you have the cancer? They don't know. Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed rather late. Who is this doctor? Hanna knows a specialist in London. Ah Simon, it's Walter Lohkehl, he's the expert for this type of cancer in all over Europe. We know him for 30 years. And dad? What? - Does he know? Ah, nonsense. Ah, Simon. Is my father at home? She's 65, like me. At some point it has to start. One cannot watch these losers. Mother had 3 months to adjust to death, but that was too long for her. She made two weeks out of it. She donated her body for the purpose of plastination, settled the most important things, or the ones, she considered important, and after that she took 39 Valium. Mother was a numerologist. It was on the 03.09. , three minutes past nine. Unfortunately Clara came to visit and found her... too early. By the time the ambulance arrived, her heart had stood still for 6,5 minutes. Mother was 65 years old and 6,5 minutes were enough, to deactivate her brain for all time. But it wasn't enough for the rest. Clinically she was dead, but her body, flanked by machines, went on functioning. nine. Though the daughter, who moved 1993 to Stuttgart and turned 39 one week before, thwarts the plan, because she arrives by night train at 09:30, at a moonlight tariff of 39 Euro. Despite mothers living will we had to sign approx. 500.000 signatures, till we could take her home out of the hospital. Father didn't come, Clara had to go back to Stuttgart. some friends came, but at some point no one came except the nurse. The dying, once they can't even speak, are hardly existent for the rest of the world. But the body keeps breathing, digests the supplied nutrients. Nothing else. Allegedly that's good enough. Hey. - Should I really not come? Better not. - Okay. Sunday 08:30 o'clock. Sunday mornings mother always stood up early and went alone for a walk. I've always conceived this to be a little bit hypocritical. Like constantly quoting Erich Fromm and cite "Steps" from Hermann Hesse as favourite poem, this Cheer up-Pamphlet for remorseless carrying on, on which interestingly enough all Germans can agree, that's because, as my mother readily said to underpin her good taste, it is the lyrical legacy of the post-war Germans. The heart must be, at each new call for leaving, prepared to part and start without the tragic, without the grief - with courage to endeavor a novel bond, a disparate connection. Yeah, father used to say this after you were gone. For hardly set in one of life's expanses we make it home, and apathy commences. But only he, who travels and takes chances, can break the habits' paralyzing stances. Easy said. It might be, even, that the last of hours will make us once again a youthful lover: The call of life to us forever flowers Anon, my heart: Say farewell and recover! ... and recover! I welcome you to our series Culture, ecology und everyday life. Right behind me you can see the performance artist lepe Rubingh being busy for some time drilling for oil. Namely at the Mauerpark in Berlin's district Prenzlauer Berg. He wants to point out, that one can replace the dwingling ressources by oil, which lies undiscovered underneath our hometowns. Namely preferred underneath centuries old cultural monuments, like for instance the Cologne Cathedral... Good things come in threes. What's that? -Art. Hanna! Are you coming? You are working in television? -I'll go and check on this young man. lepe, this is unbelievable, what exactly have we just seen? We just hit upon oil. There is this oilfield right underneath the middle of Berlin, We knew it all the time! Does anybody have a light? Want a beer? -Yeah, I'd love to! Here you are. - Thanks. Do you play here regularly? - Every sunday, Union Berlin at two p.m. Are you colleagues? Most of them know each other already from school. From Berlin? - No, from Grlitz. Ah, you're all from the east. What about you? - Ostmark, Graz. Very well, from Easterner to Austrian. What the hell was that? - What do you mean? It was great! And, who won? -2:2. I'll go take a shower. Do you want to come to the stadium with us? To the stadium? - Union? Union. - Union! It says here, we called you four times. -Yeah, maybe. I already thought, I had to pick you up at home personally. Well, our suspicions were confirmed. Admittedly I've got just a slightly increased marker, but you'll have to do a chemotherapy anyway. Well, two. What about sex? Why am I asking this? Ah, nothing, well, no problem. Though directly after the OP you'll want to take a break for yourself. Hmm... which OP? Didn't you listen? Can you explain it briefly one more time? You have testicle cancer, Mister Sievers. We have to remove one of your testicles. Operative. Immediately. Oh, I see. Allright. Nowadays you can gain control of testicle cancer. We just have to act immediately. Can you stay here now? Today evening we are free. Hanna Blum, please speak after the beep. I don't know, what you're doing right know, but I'm going under the knife. Right? Hanna Blum, please speak after the beep. That's it, good bye. I'm lying at St. Johann, station 12B. Hanna, damn it, where are you? Avant-garde medicine. They cut off your balls and you even don't get a general anaesthetic. So you can witness the performance live first-hand. Was Modernism really such a good idea? I let reality as system of power wash over me. But maybe being in a bad mood is your way of becoming connected with the world again? Just think of something perfectly positive. Hanna. Swab. - Ah, shit. Excuse me? Mmh? - Did you say something? We fool ourselves. Oah, I would never do that. No? - No. That's nonsense, we're not using contraceptives anyway. Why not? I don't know. We stopped, once we were sure nothing can happen. Why is that? I don't know. Probably one of us is infertile. Did you check on that? No. - You should. Speculation does only upset. Do we know each other? You had an affair with me, '92. Ruth Fischer? I had an abortion back then. From me? For the creation of stem cells the crossbreeding of different cell types is not even necessary anymore. Didn't you discuss that? - Yes, we have, and I understand it in principle, but really I don't understand it. Well, then come and visit me at the institute. I will. I'm hungry. We are all hungry. - Where are you going? Schuuuusterjunge! Our team, our pride! Union Berlin! Bye! - Okay, bye. Now they're gone. We had that coming. Graz, isn't everybody catholic there? -And? You too? - Of course! I don't know about you Eastern Germans. Me neither, an enigmatic tribe. My grandma always said you were the most dedicated Nazis among all. Well, everybody's good for something. Yes, but what's going on with her? - With Petra? We've been together, some time ago. I knew that. She is still your fan. How long ago was that? - 2 years, see. She stared at me the whole evening. Complete alarm. She's your type, yes? - Back then I did think she's hot. So, Nr. 60. Jeez, who's living here? Me. - Really? Yes. There you are. A bit like at the employment center. I like it like that... It has a certain charme, nice laminate... Beer or wine? I, ehm... Water. Unfortunately I don't have a TV, so I don't know your show. Never mind. I need a restroom. Over there. Just like that? Yes. Hanna? Hanna? Hanna, everything alright? Fucking doors! Aren't these emergency exits? They are supposed to open! Yes, from inside. The fire escape is round the corner. Come on. You don't have to stay. Sleep. Why didn't you ever tell me? You were with Hanna. I didn't have a chance anyway. But I'd have a child now. Our child would be 17 today. Did you have children later? No. Good night. Simon? Hey, baby. Hey, sweetie. Hey, baldy! Want a bite? - No. Great, your diet. I'll join you. What's your opinion on the "Schleier question"? Schleyer? Hanns-Martin? The "Schleier question" (veil question): Should muslim women in Germany unveil themselves at work, in schools for example... What, they still discuss that? - Yes. I don't know. If you ask me, the whole Islam can be disposed of. Now, come on! Anti-metastatic discourse: the veil is ideological, misogynistic, everything. Most women don't see it like that. And? That doesn't solve the problem. I don't know. A political sign is established only then when he, who is making it, wants it to be understood like that, no? - What nonsense is that? What? - Now don't be so lazy! Yes ... hello? When you run around in a swastika t-shirt, is that only political if you mean it like that? What a stupid comparison. - Not stupid. Why, for example, are you still embarrassed to drive a Mercedes? Now, stop it! Stop what? - This is yesterday's news. Since you got sick, you don't have any persistance. Yes, why would that be? I don't like it when you're sick. - I know. I think it's great. - I'm bored. Come here. Poor baby, how are you? I'm feeling sick. Say, you really wanna do this, the funeral service on Saturday? We can't cancel it anymore. Of course ! My mother has been lying in Gunther von Hagens freezer for a week now. I really think we should do a mortuary before the deceased is standing, barenaked, plastinated, and with drawers coming out of her belly, in some congress center. Unbelievable, your mother. Did you ask your doctor? What now? About fertility. Why? Do you suddenly want children now? I don't know, maybe. Oh Lord, the poor ones. Where are mummy and daddy? Out on the balcony, screaming at each other, as usual. And then, after 6 weeks of day care, after 6 years of psychiatry. We are probably the first case of divorce in world history where nobody wants custody. You are nasty. You think children are nasty. Why do you say this now? Those are your words. You're nasty. Stop being this mean. Like every blossom fades and every youth gives way to old age, every phase of life blossoms, every wisdom blossoms and every virtue in its time... one day will hold its hand over my fading soul, when the time comes. ... that she was a free soul, a free spirit and a free human. Whatever that means. Hard to tame such a bird. Tie it down with tight strings. If she doesn't want to, she's not coming. Bye, Thomas. - See you. I think he can stand on one leg, can't he? Simon, please don't be angry, hm? But you know, father doesn't like to leave home. Thanks for coming anyway. Bye. I think I have an appetite. Really? What for? I don't know. -You get everything you want. That's great. What day is today? Saturday, why? The 16th? Mmh. Why? Then it's our 20th anniversary. Really? Jeez. What? First kiss or first sex? First kiss. Muskauer Strasse, October 16th, 1990. Shouldn't we finally get married? Okay. Slow. Yes... Yes, relax. And ... Suck in and inject. Good, you got a sure hand. Is there anybody yet who forms a sculpture out of our logo? No, not yet. Why are we building a pedestal, if there's nothing to put on it? The concept has been neglected, but the pedestal has been paid for. Now I have to take care of it. - Then, enjoy... And while the ship was on full speed, two people were helping him to the front. When the boat steered towards the left side of Moby Dick he didn't even seem to notice. Ahab was in the middle of the steamy fog, that was hovering around his mighty back. Great, the cold air, isn't it? You are at Prinzenbad sometimes, during summer, right? Right. A race? Okay. Okay. But unfair. Why? Just had surgery. Bad? Testicular cancer. Oh. And? One less. Makes you faster. Less air resistance. Dear visitors, the bathing ship closes in 15 minutes. We thank you for visiting and wish you a good evening. Show me. Scar check. What? Not bad for such a small guy. Alright. See you soon. Where were you so long? I had a drink. With whom? Alone. Alone? Come closer. Morning. Early bird, even on weekends? Aren't you coming to bed anymore? Want a tea? I don't have any. Yes, I can go get some. Should I? Sometime, yes. Yes. I'll go and take a shower, okay? - Yes. Clean, time for a change of sides. Mate. Hi. Hello Adam. What are you doing outdoors, at this weather? Clean up the cellar, and... - Are you coming? Children's dinner. - The potatoes aren't ready yet. Someone help me prepare the table. I'm coming in. Can you get him? I'm going crazy. I was just upstairs. If you can't do it, who can? What's up, you're coming out today? Daddy, you don't understand. Yes, but mom says, you're in there the whole day. Since 00.30h yesterday. - Colour is our food, ... I have to distribute color four times. - ... our strength. Color? - ... our hope. Yes, look. - It is ... the essence and meaning of our suffering. This is the realm in-between life and death. So, the souls need color, otherwise they die. I can get the color for them, but... Come on, Nick, we only meet every 2 weeks. Dad, I think it's really cool that you're here now, but do you know what would be much cooler? If you could take over for a moment. I have to go to the toilet. And if the guards come, just throw the color. ... you are condemning both of us to death. If you wish to die so much, go to your slasher. Fight the disgusting, evil, foreign enemy. Help me! Nick? Where is the color? Nick, where is the color? I'll go back to the office soon. Okay. Hey, hi. - Hi. Hi. Long time no see. Adam isn't here? No, we called a few times, but nothing. Fuck, I missed it. Oh, I'm sorry. Bye! - Bye! Ciao! Hello? -Adam? This is Hanna, Hanna Blum. Oh, hi. Hi. I got a recipe here. This also? And this. I'll go for a drink, wanna come? Yes, I'll be there soon. - See you. Evening. - Hi. Which material is this? - Steel and stone. It's gonna be some huge bastard. Take a look... Ahm, excuse me. Here I am. Aahh. Hello, Dr. Born. Hello, Dr. Blum. I didn't think I'd see you again. You mean today? No, I mean at all. Ah, I'd say life is incalculable. That's for sure. How can I help you today? It's 11:30h. You wanted to show me your realm. Oh, of course. Are you doing artificial insemination? -That's what I started with. I was the expert on that, I'm still doing the education. We earn the money with In-Vitro, so we can continue research. First floor is stem cells, second floor Yamanaka research. Yamanaka. - I'll explain it to you. So, it's plain human skin cells. You know that. Yes. - And here, ... the viruses that carry the cells are sorts of messengers, messengers of genetically enhanced food. They attach themselves to the cells and so carry their freight inside. And through this DNA, brought in through the back door skin cells transform themselves back into pluripotent stem cells. Pluripotent, that means they reproduce? -No, that means they are basis cells, that can transform into every cell type of the body. They are not yet specialized. One could say, we are reprogramming the skin cells to return to the stadium, that makes embryonic stem cells so valuable. They can transform to every type of cell, for example those that are defect in a sick body, or that have problems with growth. Not bad, really. And without having to breed our DNA in some cow ovum. So much for the British and their chimares nonsense. Sorry. What's he doing? Isn't he leaving? Coffee? - I'd love to. A son? Anything else? I have a boat at the sea. I'm getting seasick on boats. My son too. He has to go anyway. Do you have to go back to the lab? You don't have anything. What do you mean? No stuff, no books. Aren't you reading? Oh, hi. -Hey. What's that fragrance? You smell awfully good. You're in a good mood today, dear. Bye. - Bye. Another beer? What are you doing otherwise, besides swimming? I won't tell. Why? I don't know. I have the impression that I talk too much. You tell me what you're doing first. -I'm building art. And what does that mean? My company builds and plans objects for artists, mostly sculptors. They have an idea or a plan, and we build it. And what kind of art is it? Mostly installations or large sculptures. Really? - Yes. Do you have a card? Yes, I think I should have one. Thanks. That means you got my number now. Can I have yours, too? Of course. I don't know how this is usually working. What? With the anonymity. Ahm ... with gays. You know, I'm not gay. I mean, I wasn't gay, until now. And now you think you are? No idea. No. Yes. I don't know. Don't worry too much. It's not that easy. It is. You just have to say goodbye. -To what? To your deterministic ideas of biology. Hey. - Hey. You look great. You too. Wait. Doesn't hurt? You smell different. How? I don't know. Good. Marriage is closed when bride and groom, before the registrar, in person and personally, declare to marry each other. ... and when it says "Hamlet", then I can't tell myself, I can't say, that's a heterosexual man with his special problem, I don't have anything to do with him, then I'm requested to say: Yes, him, he represents me. - Exactly. But then, when there is Medea, then one would say, yeah, there is a woman, a foreigner, suppressed, with this certain "sanitary napkin issue". There should be a house of differences, in which we can live together. But the first section table we are laid upon comes right after our birth, where they say, this is a girl and this is a boy. We tell each other this is a biological order, but maybe it's just symbolic. Yes. - Yes. Rostock. What are you doing there again? Look at bad art. Take it easy, baby. I'll be back tomorrow. Hey! - Hey! Not bad. It's almost finished! Don't we wanna go to your place? I don't live alone. What exactly does that mean? It means there is another man. Instead the 4 genomes they needed to introduce the retrovirus into the cell, they need only two now. You may kiss the bride. ... the idea to start something with a man. The disgust for this normality everybody is subordinating themselves to, fell together with the discovery of a perversion of her fetishistic sleep. Perverse. Yes. At least, she was something special among all those normal weirdos, really perverse. Everything else was such a waste of time... What are you doing? Don't know. Wanna go to your place? No. That's impossible. Why? - I don't live alone. Oh no. Oh how sweet. How beautiful! One, two, three. A bit confused, don't you think? A few things I like. - Hi. Everything is so chaotic, I really don't know. Who was that again? -Some editor. I forgot his name. Somehow I'm feeling sick. - Really? Should we leave? Yes, no, ehm... Let's continue. I gotta go to the restroom. -Me too. Lord! Hey. - Are you okay? Shouldn't we better leave? -Okay. This way. Hey, Hanna! Hi! What are you doing? - Haven't seen you for an eternity. I did this installation here. Do you like it? You made this? - A computer controlled light animation. The color changes every 12 seconds, this represents the change between orient and occident. As usual there wasn't much money. But we really made an effort. Something's wrong with the dimmer. The circuit is reversed. She's my studio guest tonight. She could show up in the city sometime soon. Yes, I'm waiting. Oh fuck, I got my period. Can you spare a tampon? No, I don't have one too. Crap, we always have them somewhere. What's up? I didn't have my period for quite a while. Maybe you're pregnant. When a line appears in the squared window as well as in the round one then you are pregnant. Stop. That means subjugation as well as subjectification. Yes, yes, that's an old question. Why is it so hard to free oneself from old submissions? Why are exactly those the terms, that insult, hurt, regulate and control us, without which we cannot live, which we need, to be able to take a position in society. Why are we attaching ourselves to ideas that degrade and devalue us? The usual answer is because we can't be any different. They enable us to stay alive. And this is paradox. We are floating in-between established categories because we take possession of them and enable ourselves to take public influence through them. We even accept to be perceived classified and recognized in categories, that throw us into ambivalence, and we do it anyway, because we can only exist like this, which means: be accepted like this. I'd say the price we pay for this is a certain effect of alienation, for acting within the limits of the readable and acknowledgeable. To persist in your own being means for Spinoza not to stay the same, but it means an expansion, transformation, of the given. The urge to persist cannot be reduced to the aspect of conservation, otherwise you would have what Freud describes as self-preservation drive. Indeed, our insistingly holding on to life can bring us to accept conditions of existence that negate and devalue our life. It's possible to be deceived about which way leads to a more or less better life. The complicated thing about this is that you cannot be outside the categories of acceptance ... Hello? - Hi, it's me, open up, please. Hanna, what's going on? - We gotta talk, please open up. That's impossible now. Didn't you understand? I have to talk to you. Come on, open up! Hanna, I'm not alone. I don't fuckin' care! Now open the door, goddammit! Now it's getting complicated. What's going on? Is she still here? What? -The other one, is she still here? You told me you're not alone. Hanna, what's going on? What happened? I'm pregnant. This is Simon. What? What, you know each other? What are you doing? What are you doing here? Oh, fuck! Can you please explain this somehow? What did she say? Jeez! Now explain in more detail, please. I think, for the first time in a very long time, I don't know what I really want. I think for the first time in a long time you know exactly what you want. Yes? You're in love. Yes. - See. Never thought I'd experience that. - Yes. And it's already over. And why? There's another guy. -You got another guy? Complicated. No, we both do. Is this her anyway? -Definitely. You can't know that. If one of them is my mother, then it's her. Come on, let's go somewhere else. It's June 22nd, if my calculation is correct. Do you know who did it? It's two. Wow. I missed you. I missed you too. I miss Adam too. Me too.
