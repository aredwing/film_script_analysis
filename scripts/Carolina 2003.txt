So how's married life|treating you this week, Ernie? Fine. Fine, fine. It's another book.|You know me, I didn't go through the 8th grade.|My grandbaby here reads Anna Karena. Anna Karenina. She jumped in front|of a train when her boyfriend left. Yeah, well grandma's gotta pee. I want coffee, please. No, you're too little. You have coffee. Thank you, that'll be all Susan. You know what, you're not a fairy|princess. You're a fairy bitch. Yeah, you're an ugly smart bitch.|No one will ever marry you. I hate you! - I hate you even more!|- Look at my shoes! So what do I care? - You did that on purpose!|- No I didn't! - Yes you did!|- No! - I didn't!|- Yes you did! You're a bitch! Go ahead, kill each other. Don't worry about the mess.|I'II hose it down after the killing. Friends, I need some peace. But Millie, you can't leave them|outside with those butcher knives. They ain't that sharp. Georgia. We are not being raised right. Hi daddy. Sweet girls, daddy's got|a surprise for you. A big surprise. Is it a puppy? Meet your new baby sister.|Her name is Maine. Is her momma dead, too? No, her mom's in a crazy house|in Bangor. Theodore. Hi, momma. These better be|your soiled shorts in here. Give me those knives. Don't you sound that horn at me, you son of a bitch.|Leave another child at my doorstep. Things are gonna be different|for you, Maine. I promise you that. Thanks for coming in, John.|You know how the show works, right? Yeah, you find me a date. Right. That is true. But first, you need to tell me|what you look for in a woman. Well, I want to re-enact|every scene from "91/2 Weeks." You know, that movie with|Kim Bassinger and that guy. When I meet my date,|I don't even want to know her name. - Are you following this, Carolina?|- Loud and clear, Dave. - John.|- John. Hi, it's Maine.|Code word grim. John, this is my assistant, Snake.|He's gonna take over for a second. - Wait, how do you know what I want?|- John, it's what I do. Maine? Carolina, hello.|Grandma broke my riding crop. Maine, you said code word grim. And why are you speaking|in the phony British accent? Grandma locked herself in the|dressing room and won't come out. Okay, tell me. They advertised a $89 VCR in the|paper but the sale ended yesterday. Grandma said that's a crock of shit.|Snapped my riding crop in half and locked herself in|the dressing room. Two hours ago. Maine, just so you know, you lost|your accent on that last part. - Is Georgia with you?|- Why yes. She is. Georgia, it's Carolina. Hi, what's up? Can't you do something before this|ends up in another police report? Maine! Wait, we have movement. Get me some toilet paper, honey, cause I gotta go to the bathroom. $56.90, lady, you win. I want to experience you. - Who, me?|- Sorry I'm late. All my wonderful people. Daphne St. Claire|is in the building. - Nice to see you.|- How are you. Nice to see you. Hello, my dear. Look at all these people.|They've been camped out for days. It's like a Pearl Jam concert.|You know why? No, Albert, enlighten me. Daphne's books unlock|the mysteries of love. - We're next.|- Daphne is an oracle. What would the oracle say about|the mysteries of my love life? You always pick the wrong guy.|They either dump you, or... you dump them.|You never get past the third date. That's not true.|I have a fourth date tonight. There you are, darling.|Have a nice day. Wow! Miss St. Claire, I can't tell you|what it means to finally meet you. Well, hello, darling. That's the second bad accent|I've heard today. Who shall I make this out to? Albert Morris. I love all your books. They'rejust so... glamorous. Like you. Daphne, tell me... How do you write|about love so well? Are you gay? Not gay. Just a fan. All hearts know about love.|All you have to do is listen. - She was good this time, wasn't she?|- She was sober this time. Your publisher should really hire a|better actress for your next book. Remember, I want a full report|on the fourth date in the morning. You have one message. Hi, Carolina. This is Blake. Listen, about tonight...|Something came up. Morning. Good morning, Carolina. How was the fourth date? He cancelled. He dumped you? You all right? Of course I am.|I've forgotten about it already. You should move, Allie. You an afford a house|in Beverly Hills or adjacent. And I hear they keep their car|stereos for 6 months around there. No, I like the ambience here. The ever-changing graffiti, the distinct aroma of urine|in the air... Wondering why that helicopter|keeps circling over my head. I like our morning ritual. It makes|me feel like I've got a real job. Have a great day at work. Yeah, you too. Take care. Hi. Okay. I don't normally do this, but I don't think that people who|do this are freaks. Necessarily. Anyway, I'm looking for a woman. Hi. I'm funny and I'm fun and... I'm a good dancer, good kisser, and I'm looking for someone|"who is nice and has a good job". I got to see|"some pearly white teeth". You can't be missing teeth. And no|yellow teeth, know what I'm saying? A sense of humor is key. Cause a lot of women,|they don't get my sense of humor. They think I'm rude,|sarcastic or arrogant It gets misinterpreted. I like to feel her skin|and I like to... see and taste and... that's, you know,|I'm in touch with my senses. And rather than me tell you,|I'll tell you what I've heard. Men and women should be|equal partners in life. Men and women should be|equal partners in life. Anyway, my name's Heath Pierson. I'm fresh off the Virgin 747 to Los Angeles|and I'm new here. So... - Snake!|- Yeah? - I am the one they call Snake.|- Who's that guy? He's one of the late ones|after you left. - Put him on with that Kate girl.|- Kate? All right. Why is it so quiet?|Where is everybody? Well, tomorrow is Thanksgiving. Daphne? Are you there?|I've got to go. Are you all set? Daphne, aren't you ready yet? Princess Tabitha has just been|kidnapped by Roark the Pirate, who has dragged her|into his lair of wanton desire. Isn't that the third "pirate capture|the princess" story you've written? Pirates are classic. And why are all the girls always|princesses, tell me that? All women are princesses.|Guess what happens next. She caresses|his throbbing manhood. No, too soon, my pretty. Guess again. She removes her bodice|with trembling hands. No, he'll remove it. He'll do it.|Last guess, make it a good one. Okay.|His hands slowly roam his newly conquered territory. That I like. I'll have to drive at warp speed. - Okay, let's go, thief.|- Save, save, save! The weathertoday in Los Angeles,|temperatures in the low to mid 80's. Breezy at times, with a few|scattered clouds and smog levels. Boy does your grandmother live|in a strange part of Los Angeles. Why is it so hard to be|an adult around my family? That's why I left my family 3,000 miles away and came here. Grandma'll make a scene, someone'll|get drunk and try to shoot someone. Georgia will end up crying for no|reason. It's like family voodoo. That's why I like it. Grandma likes you, but if she knew|you were Daphne she'd kill you. Hey, Chang, how are you doing? Hello. - Hey!|- Hey! How's your wee thing hanging,|Albert? - Awee bit to the left.|- Oh, yeah. Carolina, how're you doing, baby? - I'm good, how are you?|- I'm good, baby. - These are for you.|- Thank you. Why did you go waste your money on|something that's gonna die anyway? Cause I wanted to. Well, next time,|make it perfume. So how are you, grandma? I'm as nervous as a whore|in church, honey. I've got all this food to cook up|for my crazy family. - Would you let me help this time?|- No, you'll just get in the way. Well, I hear you're bringing|your new man. I broke up with him. You broke up with him? Carolina. Lying your ass off|is unbecoming, honey. You go see Maine. She's been|hollering for you all day. I swear that child is one taco|short of a combination plate. Albert, come in here|and get your belly full. - I've got a present for you.|- Don't you knock? Mirabeaus don't knock.|Maine, we have no boundaries. What are you doing? Maine is winning the lottery. Is that so? The rocking horse boy rode so hard|he went into a trance and in the trance he saw the winning|horse's name before each race. You reading D.H. Lawrence now? I put big money on the Kentucky|Derby and I'm gonna win the lottery. I've already seen two winning|lottery numbers. 4 and 27, see? 4 and 27. If you insist on patronizing me,|please leave. You're clouding my trance. What's that? Onscreen programming. You can set the timer to record|your favorite shows. See? Don't let technology scare you. Nothing scares me, kid.|I just want you to do it for it. Hey. Guess what? Grandma got a top of the|line VCR. It only cost her 50 bucks. So I heard. Shut. You gotta do what you gotta do,|Carolina. Life is serious business. I got me my leather interiors|with that toilet paper trick. Works every single time.|No bullshit. Okay, all you lazy good-for-nothing goldbrickers. Dinner is served.|Come and get it. If grandma offers you|jerky or chitlings say no. Well. I see your Aunt Marilyn|brought her breasts. - Warning one, Albert.|- How long was she in for? Three months. Aunt Marilyn used her|little black book again. Police chief, who was into high|heels, let her out on good behavior. Inspiring. She should write a book.|Daphne St. Claire could co-write it. - Over Daphne's dead body.|- Daphne could use the research. Would you really sleep with a $50|a night hooker and pay for it? I don't know about paying for it. No, seriously. Seriously? I've never really been|a one-night-stand kind of guy. So you've been in love with|all the women you've slept with? Well... Well, how many have there been? Afew. Okay, but how many? Hey, back off. So you really think you know|what love feels like? Come on, Carolina,|stop dawdling. - Come on.|- Yes, Ma'am. No, I don't eat meat any more,|remember? And you wonder why|you can't find a man? Watch it. Next. Got it close, didn't I? What's that in your hand? It's a party, isn't it? What's with you and my daughter?|Ain't you having sex yet? What? No, no. We're just good friends,|that's all. What's the matter?|She not good enough for you? - No, no.|- What? I mean, yes, of course she is...|She's just... friends and sex don't mix. Where's... I'm sorry, what's|his name, your new boyfriend? - Seth.|- Right. I broke his heart. Why do I keep doing that? What happened? I told him my baby wasn't his. You're pregnant? How can you be pregnant? The usual way. Do you know who the father is? Excuse me? I mean, of course, of course|you know who the father is. Right? I do. Well, do you want me|to go with you? I'm gonna keep it. You're gonna raise a baby|all by yourself? You don't have a job.|You've never had a job. I tried to get ajob once. I didn't have the right shoes. Don't tell grandma, okay? I'll tell her.|When the time's right. Okay? Grandma, have you read|Daphne St. Claire's new book? Oh, you're damned straight|I have. That's what you need, girl. A man like Ashlen China|from "Roughing it at Midnight." Ashlen's from "Moonlight Rhapsody."|He's not her type. You read the romances, Marilyn? Oh, I already know|all I need to know. I bet you do. I like you, Albert, because you're|a man who has no shame about reading the romances. Did you read|"Love's Sacred Desire"? Crap! You didn't like "Desire"? No. That Daphne St. Claire|shot her wad on that one. Too much talking,|not enough loving. What she needs to do is get drunk|and howl at the moon. I agree. You could use a little howling|yourself, honey. I'm focusing on my career. Okay, but your titties aren't gonna|stay perfect forever, you know. Well, that's what surgery's for. Right. You got one big problem, Carolina.|It's called bad man picking. How can you say that when you've|only met one guy I've been with? I don't need to meet the rooster|when I got the hen right here. And the hen's not happy. The hen is, too, happy. The hen looks down on|her grandma cause the grandma leads her life|exactly anyway she damn pleases. In fact,|the hen hates her grandma - cause of that.|- I do not. It'sjust that I would|do things differently. Oh, really, how's that? Everybody. I have an announcement to make.|This year I'm gonna have a formal Christmas|sit-down dinner at my house. And I hope|all of you can make it. This is where we eat, Carolina.|You know that. - But wouldn't it be nice if...?|- Lf? If a frog had wings he wouldn't|bump his ass so much. No. Well, what about you guys? Anyone? Daddy? Why don't you girlsjust figure this|out and tell me where you want me? I can't believe he just sat there|and did nothing. He was drunk. That was his excuse when he drove us|off the overpass when I was ten. What happened. We all died, Albert. The reservoir was full of sand. She'll never come, will she? She'll come. Hey, I can't even wait|for Christmas. Night. Welcome to our local show. I'm Desie Dean. Welcome to the Perfect Date|pre-show. First, to warm us up, my friends|swami Hemichandra. La-mastra everybody. The warm up|is stand up, everybody cold. Are you Carolina? - Yeah, yes.|- Hi. I'm Heath Pierson. Snake says you're the one to thank|for choosing me as a contestant. You're welcome, Heath.|Was it a successful date? Yes, yes it was.|The romance wasn't there, but... we had a good time. What a great attitude. Most people,|if it's not love at first sight, they wished they had never|come on the show. Why did you? I lost a bet with someone in my|office. But I thought, 'Why not? " I'm new to L.A,|I don't know anyone. And it's a difficult city|to meet people in, as you know. We're on in 10 minutes. You don't want that on you. Hello, everybody.|Okay, is anyone nervous? Don't be. The hard part's over.|You've already had the date. Now all you have to do|is tell Chuck all about it. - My date hated me. I could tell.|- I'm sure she didn't, John. Actually, he's right.|He's a complete asshole. Okay. Tara, you know you can't|say "asshole" on TV, right? He took notes on everything I did.|And my name's not Tara, it's Kate. I'm Tara. And I didn't hate my date.|He was totally hot. Oh, I see. Okay, Kate. Let's stick to positive comments|when we're on the air, okay? I understand. You screwed up. I should have had him. Hello, I'm your new P.A.|Kristine. Phone call - for Carolina.|- Take a message, please. Snake said to tell you that|Georgia's blowing chunks. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Kristine, can you please escort our|contestants to the holding room? Okie dokie, you've got it. So who knows where|the holding room is? From Hollywood, it's your favorite game show,|"The Perfect Date." And now here's your perfect host,|Chuck McBride. Keep it coming. I can feel it.|I can feel it. I need your love. Georgia, you're supposed|to throw up all the time. Maybe because there's a person|growing inside you. We sent two contestants|on a blind date. You get to see the results right|here. And then you get to decide. Was it the perfect date! What a putz. Let's see those first two guests|right now. Here are Heath Pierson and Tara Barnell. Carolina! What? You still haven't told|grandma you're pregnant yet? Carolina! Georgia, I'll call you back. Do we still have anyone working|around this piece of crap show? Job opening. I am so sorry.|I heard what happened. How did you know|this was my car? Your name is on the fence. Souvenir. Do you want me|to sign it for you? You're funny. Yeah, well,|Chuck overruled funny. You have to believe there's|something better coming along. I'm guessing you don't want to work|a game show the rest of your life. You must be from a rich family. I thought so. Well, I can afford to buy you dinner. You get me fired|and you want to buy me dinner? Excellent question. I hope you told him|to bugger off. He must be really,|really good looking. - Yes, but...|- I thought so. Otherwise you wouldn't go out|with a guy who got you fired. He didn't get me fired,|Georgia did. Georgia didn't get you fired.|You got yourself fired. You have to learn how to say no. Like to this Heath person. - Pierson. It's Heath Pierson.|- I mean person. Like this stupid Heath person. What? Oh, who cares? I got fired and I came over|to talk to you because you're my best friend and|all we're doing is argue about it. State your business.|- It's Carolina. I need you to say you're coming|to Christmas dinner right now. Listen, baby, I got me|a fur person now. And fur people|who do not understand - formal sit down dinners...|- "Nobody's gonna come if you don't" I need you to do this for me,|please. Are you crying, baby? Yes or no? Why are you crying, honey? Bye, grandma. And remember you're hauling|Georgia's butt here this weekend. I won't forget. All right. Hello. It's me. May I come in? I'm sorry. I wasn't very sympathetic. Where'd that come from? I have 53 dollars in my savings account.|I have to go and look for a job. And the milk goes bad in two days.|What am I gonna do, Albert? You get an interview|with the big boys. You put on your black suit,|pull your hair into that little... twisty thing, and they'll|fall in love with you and hire you on the spot. There are 150 people applying|for one job in television. Maybe. But there's only one Carolina. Towel. You want to go to the movies|tomorrow night? Tomorrow night's my date|with Heath. I know we met under unusual|circumstances, but... I wanted to ask you out to dinner|the moment I saw you. You did? You were biting your lower lip. I was? It was very, very sexy. Are you for real? Are you just randomly throwing out lines|or are you telling the truth? I guess I'm randomly|telling the truth. So, you're from London.|Tell me about that. Well, there's not much to tell. I have a younger sister,|Sara, and my father's a banker.|My mother teaches English at Oxford, which is where I went to university.|I played on the cricket team. I'm an executive at an advertising|agency, and I have a flat in Paris. Do you have a wife and kids? Even|if they're in Tulsa, I want to know. Why are you staring at me? No wife, no kids.|Where's Tulsa? In Oklahoma. It's a state. Like Carolina the state? Yes, I was named after a state. My sisters, Georgia and Maine|were also named after states. Whatever state my father happened|to be in when we were born. We were named after postmarks.|Those are on postcards, but you don't|want to hear about that. I don't? No. North or south? What? Carolina. I had a wonderful time tonight. So did I. Carolina the state. North or south. Yep. South. Definitely South Carolina. Are you sure you want|to move in with grandma? Well, I can't raise a baby|by myself. - You could move in with me.|- Oh, sweet. So super sweet, but you know, the|baby will have Maine to play with. You know me, I like a lot|of energy around me. Well, you have told grandmother|that you're pregnant, right? Right? Well, I'm still waiting|for the perfect time to tell her. Back up, back up. Back in the car. I'm bored.|We're going to the movies. - Come on.|- Let's unload the U-Haul first. I don't want to do any work.|I want to go be entertained by some black and white piece of crap. I'm off duty when I'm dreaming. You smiling rat bastard,|you're gonna be dead soon. - Grandma, please.|- Keep it down! I want popcorn. Not spending six bucks on twenty|cents worth of popcorn, honey. I made this gumbo yesterday.|You're gonna eat it and be happy. How are you feeling, Ben?|I thought you were sick. Well, ask her where|she was last night. Show's up there, buddy. - I want popcorn.|- Stop, stop. Jeff, why don't you tell me you've|been working hard at the bank. Who'd you put out for, Popsicle?|Sure as hell can't act worth a lick. Will you shut up? Listen, sonny... Grandma, I'm pregnant. Georgia, now is not the time. What? Hold it. - Hold it.|- You hold it. Well thank you for revealing|that little tidbit of information before you unloaded the U-Haul. Cause my child-rearing days|are over, sunshine. It's not gonna cost a thing.|I'm gonna breastfeed it. Can we talk about this|in the lobby, please? Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to|take your seat and lower your voice. What are you? I'm the manager, ma'am. - How old are you, Mr. Manager?|- Twenty, ma'am. Listen. Carefully,|you leave now. I can't do that, ma'am. You know murder is a funny thing. It happens to all sorts of people|in all sorts of places. Nobody's safe any more. Even little snot-nosed, pudgy theatre managers running up and|down the aisle with a flashlight. We never get to see the end|of the movie when you come. I'm gonna calm Maine down and|get Georgia's stuff to my house. You think it's a good idea,|do you? Saddling yourself with two kids when|you don't even have a job yourself. Yes, I do. I thought you'd be|on your horse. I'm not in the mood. And what about your numbers? I've only got two numbers left. Girls, get your butts out here and help Georgia|unload the U-Haul. She's pregnant, for God's sake. Come on, get your butts out. So I moved Georgia in. And still she's gonna have a baby|with no father around. I can't believe she's gonna let|history repeat itself like that. She has her own free will.|She can do what she wants. Yeah, but she's not even taking it|seriously. It's no big deal to her. - She's doing something unexpected.|- It's not unexpected, you're right. You know, the problem isn't her.|It's you. What? Things don't always have to go|according to plan. Your plan. No. Let go. And for God's sake,|Carolina, live a little. Carolina Mirabeau. Live a little. Happy birthday, Carolina. - It's my birthday.|- Happy birthday to you. Happy, happy, happy birthday. What are you doing for Christmas? - All right?|- Yes, you look lovely, darling. Come here. You're gonna be late. Who cares?|I'm having fun. Oh, Albert, come out here.|I want you to meet somebody. Hey. Albert. Heath,|this is Albert Morris, my neighbor.|My neighbor and best friend. Hi. Heath Pierson.|I've heard a lot about you. You have? Well I've heard|a lot about you too. Good. Of course. Did you get my birthday card?|I left it on your doorstep. Yes. Thank you. Did you read it? I haven't gotten a chance|to open it yet. Of course, you were busy. Well, read the card. And if you're still interested,|let me know, okay? I should be off.|Nice to meet you, Albert. Can we do that again, please? When we get to the piano dynamic,|keep the tempo... Do you think the musicians|ever miss a note? Of course.|Nobody's perfect. That's why there's|so many of them up there. Enjoy your present now. They're all playing for you. Why don't you like him, Albert?|You don't even know him. I know him. Now he is perfect.|He's Flawless Man. Flawless body without working out,|flawless smile, never runs out gas, never breaks a sweat.|Never says the wrong thing. Makes us ordinary guys|feel invisible. You got all that|from one hello? I'm a writer. Ljudge character|faster than a speeding bullet. I thought we didn't judge. We judge when the rules are broken.|You slept with him last night on the 2nd date at your house.|That breaks every Carolina rule. But I've lived a little,|Albert. I want a normal, available guy,|and I think I've found one. He makes me happy. Anyone named Heath Pierson|is not a normal guy. I saw his car. A Jaguar. He's not a normal guy. I invited him to Christmas dinner. You did what? Christmas dinner's for family. And what about you, anyway?|You write about all this passion and romance and|"my love for you is endless." When was the last time|you went on a date? As it so happens,|I do have a date. Come on, you do not, Albert. I do, too.|Why is that so surprising? A fourth date, in fact.|She's a writer. And not another Daphne write, but a|New York Times bestseller writer. I met her at my publisher's holiday party|two weeks ago. Enjoy the concert. ...four bars straight there.|Join in the fun. A little more Sax. So you're telling me you honestly|don't know what happened? No. It's just not like Albert. It is hard work being so dense,|Carolina. What is that supposed to mean? Why don't you take a ride on Maine's|horse and see what come up. Be careful,|that's my wedding china. Why can't you just say|what you mean? All right.|Here's a thought. Forget about Albert, forget|about Maine and forget about me, for that matter. What about you, Carolina?|Why is your life so hard? Makes me think you're living|somebody else's instead. Okay. Okay, fine. Tomorrow is Christmas dinner. I want|you there more than anyone else. Shit! Why didn't you say so|in the first place? Hi. You look nice. Carolina. Look at these plates. Grandma|lent them to me for Christmas. All this time using paper plates|and she had an entire set of china. - Can you believe that?|- Carolina. Anyway, I want to apologize for|the Hollywood Bowl thing yesterday. - Carolina.|- You can date whoever. Or is it whomever? Whatever.|Anyway, it's really not my business. I'm just glad you're getting|out there and taking chances. And she's a writer, a real writer. Carolina, she's here. Debbie, this is Carolina, my friend.|Carolina, this is Debbie. Hi, it's nice to meet you.|Albert's told me a lot about you. Albert's told me|a lot about you, too. I mean,|he was just about to tell me more than he has,|like that you're pretty and smart, which you are obviously.|You look great. You two look great. Together. A couple. So where|are you guys going, anyway? To a Christmas Eve service. My mom and dad and I go every year.|It's kind of a family tradition. That's lovely. All you lazy, good-for-nothing|goldbrickers, dinner is served. Merry Christmas. Grandma, I told you|not to bring anything. How are you gonna feed all these|people with one piddly bird? Now, nobody eat. Grandma's gotta pee. She brought her own turkey. I know. I saw. Albert. Are you staying? - Of course.|- What about Debbie? She's with her parents.|We're gonna meet after dinner. I don't have a name card for you. That's okay.|I can remember my own name. Oh, here, sit there.|Aunt Marilyn got arrested again. Carolina, honey,|you're out of toilet paper. Okay, who wants to say grace? I do. Albert, I love you like a son,|honey, but you Jewish people... you can't kill Christ and expect to|have a conversation with him later. Fine. He's all yours.|I'll chat with him over dessert. I'll get it, I'll get it.|Go ahead, carry on. Who's missing? Everybody, this is Heath.|Heath, everybody. My family. Sorry I'm late everyone. Happy Christmas. Wine. How lovely. I think|I have an opener in the kitchen. Who the hell is that? Language, girl.|No one knows who the hell it is. - There's a lot of people.|- Yeah. Your lipstick's smeared. Thank you, Maine. Grandma,|will you please say grace? Certainly. Everyone bow their heads,|please. Lord, bless my family. Fill their bellies|and keep them warm and safe. And now, let's get personal. Please find Georgia a man to daddy that young'un - that she's carrying.|- Grandma... Give Maine those lottery numbers|before she loses her virginity on that rocking horse. Lord, let my Teddy settle down|and plant some roots. Look over my sister Marilyn who,|bless her soul, is back injail. Enlighten her about|cellular telephones and credit card transactions,|both of which are traceable. And finally, Lord, bless my Carolina's heart for she is the best part of me. Amen. Amen. Daddy, I think you should|carve the turkey. Okay. I think you got yourself|a dilemma, son. I've got two fine-Iooking turkeys front of me here. And I'mjust one man. I'd like to ask Al to give me a hand. Al? I'll go get another knife. Let's move this Martha Stewart shit|out of the way and move this turkey. Maine, what kind of horses|do you ride? Dead ones. So you were raised in Britain? I was raised right god damn here. Language. What happened to your accent? I'm over it. No, everyone has to pass|to the right. - This way.|- Oh, to the right. Congratulations on the baby.|Where is the father to be? One night stand. Daddy, - Heath works in advertising.|- Oh, that's good work. Have you done anything|that I might know? Well, my firm did those|Absolut Vodka themed ads. You know. Bond. Absolut Bond. Oh, yeah. That was you? So what kind of work|do you do, sir? I'm a drunk. - Been 30 days since my last drink.|- Daddy, really? Big love, Daddy. It's only 30 days. Why? Because if I leave her alone,|she's gonna pee on my shoes. Did I tell you the one|about the time I found Marilyn playing lollipop with|the reverend under the table? - How about a different story?|- Okay. How about the time Marilyn|hit me up side the head with an axe handle? - Yes, tell that one.|- Yeah, how'd you get back at her? Now, even though I'm the oldest and Marilyn is the youngest, she was|always built like a brick shithouse. When she was ten she didn't have those big boobs like she's got now.|Well, she was worried about that. And there was this dance coming up,|and I said: "Marilyn, what you gotta do is get chicken|manure spread on those boobies and they'll grow faster. "|And so, she did. She spread the chicken|manure and she rubbed... and she rubbed and she rubbed... And she rubbed for weeks.|Comes the time for the dance, she stank to high heaven. And the flies were swarming|all over her. She never hit me up side the head|with that axe handle again. Is that why Aunt Marilyn's|a whore? She's not a whore, honey.|She's a madam. She's the madam cause|she likes money without taxation. Anyone for eggnog? Yeah, I'll have some.|Thanks, honey. So Heath, come over here,|honey, and sit down and tell us all about yourself. Come on. Actually, Mrs. Mirabeau,|I have to leave, I'm afraid. Another Christmas party.|One of those boring office things. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Did I tell you the one|about when... Now listen.|If you have to leave, leave. But first, can you go back|in there and tell Carolina how much meeting her family|has meant to you and... and how special a day|it was for you? Can you do that? Yeah, I can do that.|Can I ask you something? Shoot. You and Carolina?|Have you got a thing going on? No. No thing. Good night everyone.|Off to the races. Well, I had a good time. I did. You got your wish. But next time Christmas is gonna be|in my backyard again. You got it? I do. It was harder than I thought it was|gonna be. You make it look easy. Thank you. I love you, you know. I love you too, pet. Oh, about Heath person of yours... Nice boy. Isn't he though? But stiffer than a preacher's dick|at a wedding. Good night, pumpkin. Yeah? Hi. Hey. I forgot to give you|my Christmas present. - Close your eyes.|- Okay. Open them. Merry Christmas. We're the cleaning|queens of West Hollywood. Are you ready?|Five, six, seven, eight. Dusting and sweeping|and scrubbing with Comet We'll clean your mess up|from blood stains to vomit - The sweeper.|- The Hoover. I'm good with a hose. Smells can't outrun us|cause I'm good with my nose. - Get the stains out.|- Scrub that tile grout. Using decleaning foam. We'll pass the red glove test|in no time at all. We'll even Feng Shui your home. The cleaning queens. - That was great!|- I just had a glass ring fall out. So, leave the dishes to the experts|and come with me. What is it? Oh, new Daphne galleys. Let me see. You put your own name|on a Daphne book? It's not a Daphne book.|It's my book. If you turn the page there... For Carolina.|Albert, that's... I think I'm gonna cry. I've been writing it on and off|for about a year now. It's about us, really. You're a sort of...|I mean, it's inspired by us. Is it bad? No. It's... it's... It's a love story, Carolina. It's everything I've been afraid to|say. Everything I feel about you. Albert. Oh my God. Me and Debbie, you and Heath,|you know... They're great people, yeah,|but they're not our people. Carolina. This isn't hard. We were friends first,|which is what's gonna make us last. I think I'd better go check on|the cleaning crew. Please don't walk out that door. This is all so sudden, I... You tell me that you wrote a book|about us, and that you want us... That's not fair, really. I should have known. I should have|known, this is what you do with every guy that you meet,|but... the joke's on me, isn't it.|Because I thought I was different. You are different. You can't just spring this on me.|I... I don't know what to say. You just said it. Why aren't you out with Heath|on New Year's Eve, Carolina? He didn't call. What about Albert? What do you want to wear tonight? - You decide.|- Is Ernie still married? The zipper's busted.|Of course Ernie's still married. How come you're dating|a married man? Grandma skips that commandment,|Maine. That's a good one.|Thank you, honey. Now, you know,|after a while, you learn that the rules of the world don't have to|apply to you. You think about it. It's all nonsense. It is. We're here. We die. Now when I met your grandpa|Herschel we was both 15. He could drink a whole entire bottle|of soda and never take a breath. And he had very clean fingernails.|So I married him. You know, when he died, my true|love died. Soured me on my home. So... Me and my boy Teddy,|we come west. And here I am.|Asingle grandma. And whenever I need a man,|I got Ernie. We have an understanding|between us. And, girls, that is a lot|in this world. Thank you for making me so|presentable on New Year's Eve. Evening, Millie. Evening, Ernie. Thank you. Yeah. My you look nice tonight. Okay, thank you. - That's a beautiful dress you have.|- Thank you. Now remember. God said celebrate, not celibate. Let me get that. - Thanks, Ernie. See you.|- Bye. Bye. So, what do you guys want to do|on New Year's Eve? Get drunk and watch the ball drop,|what else? - Sounds good.|- What's celibate? ...a boy. But I had a dream last|night it was a girl. Maybe twins. Well, if you have a girl or a boy,|you could still use this, right? It has like rockets|and cars and stuff. And I'm a girl,|and I like rockets and cars. 4.27. 26! 26. Here you go, hon.|Where's Albert? We've missed your faces|around here. Thanks. It's nice to be missed. Is this seat taken? How did you find me? I stopped by your apartment|yesterday but you weren't there. Albert told me you come here|every Monday morning for pancakes. So you saw Albert? Can I sit down? I'm sorry for not returning|your calls, Carolina. Yeah. We sleep together and|you don't call me for five months. That's pretty typical|around these parts. I had to go back to England|and hold a few hands. To be honest,|I sort of got cold feet. But look, I brought you something|by way of atonement. Open it. Your station is one of our clients|and I made - a few calls.|- You got me my job back? Wow. That is real Prince|Charming kind of stuff. To the rescue and all that. But? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have invited you|to Christmas dinner. It was too soon to throw you|into the Mirabeaus like that. It's just I was feeling|so sure of myself. The thing is... I was trying to force someone, you,|into my life and it's like... you're this beautiful,|expensive Italian suit and ljust don't have the faintest|idea where I'm gonna wear you. Me and my family...|They're all that I have and... we're just not suit people. That's the first time I've ever|been called an Italian suit. But I think I know|what you're saying. It's funny. I've always thought of|myself as this great communicator. Advertising and all that.|But... I sort of blew it with you. This time. Didn't I? Breathe slow, breathe slow. That's the way I did it.|I know what you're going through. You have to push harder. Okay. Wait, wait,|I got something here. Here, here... Bite, bite, hard! What is that? That was the doggie treat. - One more good push.|- I can't! All right. Now listen to me. I'm your grandmother,|are you hearing me? Now you breathe deep and push hard.|You push and you push... You push harder, harder, harder,|or I'm gonna go down there and get a plunger|and suck that baby out of you. Okay, open. Open up. Open up.|I know, I know. Oh, he's so cute. He's such a beautiful baby boy. I'm gonna name him California. - Cal for short.|- You look like a fairy princess. Now just give me that little... I want to see you close up. He's so precious. Hey. Something wrong with his eyes. They're crooked. Georgia, peach, you been|eating too many egg rolls? I'm just so glad|you could make it, son. - Sorry I'm late. Had an "AA" meeting.|- Why don't you shovel your sorrys elsewhere, cause we're full. - I had a meeting...|- Shut! ...mother. California Theodore Mirabeau. That's his name. Lord help him. You were called 22 hours ago and that girl|still named her baby after you. How much of that crap|are you gonna do before you realize how much life you are missing? You want the card, mother? Oh, he's so cute. All I've done is screw up|you girls' lives, haven't I? You could try harder. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,|Thursday, Friday. What day should I put|on that ticket? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,|Thursday, Friday. Today, tomorrow,|day after tomorrow. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,|Thursday, Friday. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Thursday, Friday. Friday, Friday. Today! Going to school. Bye. Good breasts, good boobs,|that's what I like. Hello? Carolina? I need you|to go to the bookstore. Okay, I'll go tonight. You'll go today.|Three o'clock. I'm working all day, grandma.|- For once in your life, obey me. My book comes in at 3 p. m. Today|at that bookstore that you like. They won't hold it|a moment after that, honey. I don't know, there's some kind|of run going on it. All right, all right, I'll go.|I'll get it for you. Bye bye, honey. All right, see you.|Next. One ticket. You got ID? No ID, no 24 million. I must play. This is the week.|The horse told me so. You listen to me, scum bucket.|These are winning numbers. They're going to win today and|you're going to sell me the ticket. Right now! No ID, no ticket. Next. Hi, Ernie. Why isn't she in school? She tried to buy a lottery ticket|at the liquor store. That didn't work, so she came to me.|Asked me to do it for her. Did you buy her|the ticket, Ernie? Considering how she looked I thought|I'd better bring her home first. - See what you wanted me to do.|- Thank you for that. Call me if you need me, Millie. I'll call you if I need you. Maine! You said I had to know the day!|The horse's spirit entered me and today was the day I was supposed|to win 24 million dollars! Honey, that is crazy. I'm not crazy!|Why don't you believe me? Honey. Okay, okay baby.|Come on, sit down. - Why don't you believe me?|- Sit down, sit down. Now listen to me. It's not|about me believing you. It isn't. It's about where you put|your dreams, honey. I'm not asking you to be normal|cause that's not the Mirabeau way. I'm just asking you get a little|smarter about your crazy side, okay? Okay. Yeah? That's my baby. Good girl. Hi, do you have a book on hold|for Mirabeau? You know, he's here right now. The author.|He's giving a reading. I'm going to the market, girls. Maine! No more trips to liquor stores dressed up like a harlot.|You understand me? I'll keep an eye on her. Okay. "Carolina stood up naked out of|the tub and asked for a towel. Looking at the floor,|he had one open, and as she moved into it,|her forehead came to rest on his right shoulder. Water from her hair|stained his shirt and chilled his skin. Her face was now so close to his that she looked distorted|and it came as a terrible surprise that he loved her even more|at this proximity. He realized that to her, he would|never be more than a close friend. " Hello? Maine? Not now, I'm busy. Maine, stop crying, baby. Let me talk to the police. Excuse me, I'm Carolina Mirabeau. I was brought here...|I was told that my grandmother died|in a car accident. Mirabeau. Have a nice day. - Next.|- Hi. I'm here to pick up my grandmother's things from|her car. It's the red Chevelle. Millicent Mirabeau was her name.|Here's my ID. That'll be 128 dollars. - What?|- 128 dollars. Tow, tax, storage, release. Fine. Okay. Here. Don't take credit.|Don't take checks. Cash only. All right, I'll bring cash tomorrow.|Just give me her things, please. I can't do that. All I want is her stuff.|She was killed yesterday. Well, I'm sorry for your loss,|but I'm running a business here. This is not about your business.|This is about someone's life. - Give me that!|- No. Bastard! This is not! How dare you?|Those are my grandmother's things! Give that to me! Jesus! Those are my grandmother's things!|Those are not yours, they're mine! I never got to say goodbye. Thank you. Your daddy wasn't always a drunk.|He took good care of you girls. Right up until the time|that your momma passed. I know all that, Aunt Marilyn. She|died and then he started drinking. Yeah. But baby,|it's the part before that that nobody ever told you about. Mainly because, well,|grandma told me that she'd toss me into a vat|of chicken manure if I did. Your grandma saved your life. What? Well, you see,|your momma had rich parents. When they learned that|your momma got knocked up, they took her straight|to the abortion clinic. See, your grandma|had a different view. She marched into that place like a fiery-winged|banshee from hell. No that's my boy's baby in there, and it's gonna born if I have|to shoot every last one of you. Outside, missy. Now. Sure as shit's quiet around here|without her, ain't it? It's okay. And now for the lottery numbers. 4. 27. - 27.|- 7. 7. 16. 16. 9. 9. 26. And "26". Good luck everyone.|It's a big one. "Hey, California". Tonight's jackpot is huge. I hope|you got your lucky picks here, cause here we go. Those were my numbers. "Dear Grandma Mirabeau. It's time to|come clean. I'm Daphne St. Claire." Yep, me. I didn't tell you at first because|your comments were so refreshing. I hope you like this book.|There's a lot of talking, but there's a lot of loving in it,|too. Take care of her for me.|Albert I have something for you. What is it? Open it and find out. Are those lottery tickets? They were in grandma's car.|In the glove compartment. She was playing my numbers? Yep. Every day. Well, did grandma play them|the day of the accident? The day that Maine's numbers won? No. Then it was my fault. She was going|to the store to play my numbers. It was not your fault, Maine. It was the drunk driver|who ran the red light's fault. She believed in you.|That's why she played your numbers. Are you sad that you didn't|win the money? No. It probably would have ruined my|life. Money does that, you know. What's important is|that I was right. And I'm not going crazy because|I was right about my numbers. Hello, this is Albert. I'm out of town on a book tour.|Please leave a message. Albert. Grandma died. Save, save, save. Where are your hookers? They're gonna be here soon. Why? I just read "Lady Chatterly's|Lover." I have some questions. You do, do you? Chang moved in last week. Come on, baby. Hey! You know who's playing? You know, I quit my job|at the "Perfect Date." Really? Do you have something else? Yeah, a new cable show. Making|documentaries, research and stuff. That's great. Congratulations, Carolina. Yeah, I like it.|I like it a lot. What are you doing here? Your grandma always|asked me here, and... Well, a little late,|but here I am. Okay. Okay. I think we're ready. - Who'll carve the turkey?|- I will. - Who's gonna say grace?|- Bow your heads. As grandma would say... Lord, bless this family. Fill their bellies|and keep them safe and warm. Thank you for giving Georgia|and Chang a perfect baby. Crooked eyes and all.|Thank you for not making Maine too normal. Thank you for taking care|of grandma. She can make your life hell,|but nobody loved us better. - And now, Lord...|- Let's get personal. I've eaten Thanksgiving dinner in|this backyard for the last 3 years and I plan on doing it|for the next 50.
