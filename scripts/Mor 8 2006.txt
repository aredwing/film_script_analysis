Sometimes, people... misunderstand her and perceive her as being negative. b9th grader arrested on rape charges against an 8th grader./b Now, the things she used to worry about have come true. Whether it be love, or sex amongst the students, students skipping school or even bad ethics among teachers. Where are you... Ms. Sompat? Mor 8 Darunee Suksaa School. Thonburi 1957. Our school's been around for a long time. It's regarded as the best girl's school in Thailand. Our graduates are important members of the community. Even the Vice President of the Ministry of Education is an alumnus of our school. Now suddenly we must unite with a boy's school and allow our girls to study with those hooligans. I don't agree at all. Sompat, calm down. Let's talk about it. No way! How dare they move us without any warning! They won't even let us have our own class. Look, don't you understand that being a homeroom teacher is very important? Why wouldn't I understand? The Ministry has a policy of establishing co-ed schools for boys and girls, where they can study together. You should all be proud of this project. Your school has been chosen by the Ministry and I, the vice president of the Office of Primary Education am fully responsible. I'm very happy, Ma'am, that our school has been entrusted by the Ministry. Don't you all agree? So, what's the name of the boy's school? Aksornsilp. It's a school that was chosen as the most suitable school for your girls to be sent to. The boys at that school are very proper. Hey, you asshole! Are you looking for a fight? I paid half. I need it for my exam. That's your problem! How am I gonna pass my exam? Huh? Respect for teachers... for this they are number one. I tell you, the boys over there are good and studious. Every one of them is diligent. Oh, and they're great at sports. Ma'am. - Ms. Bunrod - Yes? Who are you planning to put in charge of the girls? Oh, I think it should be these two, Ms. Sompat and Ms. Gaysorn. Yes. These two, huh? These 2 are very skilled. They're our best teachers and they are also alumni. They have our school running through their veins, Ma'am. Ma'am, you can rest assured. Oh, well if you put it that way, I believe you. The Ministry and me are prepared to help you with anything. Thank you, Ma'am. Our school has received prestigious awards for 25 consecutive years. You know... these awards were won due to honest qualities. We've never bribed anyone. If you're considering doing something damaging, then remember these awards. I hope you understand what I'm tying to say. Tidiness and being a lady, Ma'am. Anything else? Pride for girls. Darunee School focuses on teaching students self-pride. That's right. Men often think that women are weaker. They want to see us as being at a disadvantage. You two must protect the rights of those girls. Don't let them set us as just a flower on the side of the road. We only have flowers of steel. The girls I have chosen are all strong. There's no way they will break. Ms. Bunrod, I believe you have chosen the right people. Sooner or later, this co-ed school will show men that women are more valuable and stronger than they think. Aksornsilp School Pranakorn Handsome Luan... Handsome Luan. Ah, say it. Say it. Handsome Luan. Noi. Yes? That's a stubborn bird. You've been training him for a month now, but he's never said a single word. Exactly. It look like I have to go back to the pet shop. Hmm... I'd like to know if this bird could speak what it's first words would be? I'd like to find out myself. You! You're pretty good. You've built up the school's image so the Ministry would accept us into this project. Believe me, Mr. Luan. For this I must make our school really stand out in Pranakorn. The position of Principal will not pass you by. Principal... That's perfect! Don't change your mind, sir! Flatter me! Don't change your mind. Principal... Principal... Excuse me. Next time you come in, learn how to knock first. What manners! Don't you have any manners? Huh? Yes, sir. I just came to inform you that the other school is here, Sir. If that's all, you may leave. They're here... they're here... My special thing... my thing! I've already taken care of it. I chose the most modern one in the mall. The mall! Wow... fantastic! It's ready. It's ready. What the? Why is the traffic so bad in Pranakorn? We're going to arrive at school late. I think the bad traffic is a good thing. - What? - Just believe me. Good morning. - Good morning. - My name is Mr. Luan. I'm the Principal here. My name is Teacher Gaysorn. I've heard that name many times. You're as beautiful as you're rumored to be. Thank you, sir. This is... I'd like to introduce... Oh look, you just stand there. You must be tired. Please come upstairs to the meeting room. Please rest up there. Please go ahead. In the name of the Principal of Aksornsilp School, please welcome, Ms. Gaysorn. Clap your hands. So, who is that? My name is Ms. Sompat. Oh, Ms. Sompat... Ha Ha! How strange! Please, let me introduce my teachers. This is Mr. Noi, my assistant and this is Mr. Apidech, the head teacher. Mr. Ombadin is over there and he teaches history. Over here's Srirach, he teaches health education and here's Ms. Mali, who teaches Thai. As for these two, they must be Mr. Napol and Mr. Satawat, who just returned from abroad. Wow... living over there so long, you must get used to freedom. How cozy! Being on time must not be so important there... It's OK, I understand! Whoa... this means you've done your research on my school. Mali! Why are you just sitting there? You're just going to let our guests drink water? Tea, coffee, tea, coffee. Get going! Yes sir. That's OK, Ms. Mali. It's no problem. It's OK. Mr. Luan, it seems you are closer to the coffee and it looks like you must be incredibly good at making coffee. Gaysorn, she likes drinking coffee, right? Right. Umm... I like it sweet, Mr. Luan. Oh, no problem. Sweet. As for me, please don't use cream. I don't like it sweet. It's too rich. One's sweet, the other's bitter. Ooh! Look at them... are they people or statues? It's very good, Mr. Luan. Just call me Luan. It's nothing. It was my pleasure. Let's just be ourselves. Ms. Gaysorn, if you need anything, just ask. We'll be just like friends. If there's anything I can do for you, I will. Thank you very much, sir, but there's nothing in particular, as Ms. Sompat and I have come here to mold the children and teach them. We hope that we can all work together to succeed in this effort. Most importantly, we're here to help the co-ed project achieve the goals set by the ministry. Hey, hey, I can see them. I can see them. What now? Check out that enormous zit! Oh ho... That thing is huge! Ick! This one has loads of eye gunk... Eww... gross! Thank you very much Mr. Luan. That's alright. I suppose you'd like to get some rest. I think that we should show you to your dorm. Noi... Yes? Show the girls around the campus, then take them to their dormitory. Sir. Please... This way. Ms. Gaysorn? Yes? Be careful you might... This way, please. This is an old institution. It's over 51 years old. Our school is composed mostly of aristocratic children. Children of high status, royalty. Therefore, everyone acts and speaks properly. This is what I focus on most. Hey, give me back my pencil! Bastard! Why should I? You dumbass! Needle dick... Get up! Oh, I see... Now you want to fight, huh? Get up! You're gonna get it, ass wipe! Butt licker! Oh! I'll get my gang up here to kick your ass. This time you're dead meat! They're the exception, the minority. Don't worry about it. Come this way. Come on. This way. Don't worry. Everything is OK. Don't worry. Manners... Ms. Sompat, Ms. Gaysorn, you needn't worry. Boys here are all gentlemen. I focus on that heavily. Ahhh! You pansy! How dare you play with me like that! I'll get you! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You asshole! You're screwed! Bitch! The exception! Just a second, we'll go somewhere else. This way, please. This way, please. Come this way. This way. This is the home of the nobleman Sarasak Surawong. It's hundreds of years old. It's been empty for a long time. I had a workman fix it up. It's clean, comfortable, modern and liveable. As for food, you needn't worry. We have three meals a day. Otherwise, if you go to the market, you'll find something there. We have a kitchen set up for you. Oh, that... it's a link way, that's all. Don't worry about it. It's for emergencies, so that at night we can get to you in time. This way, please... This house here.... come inside. We're here. Home sweet home. It's the home where you and your students will stay. It's clean and comfortable, like I said. Here. The key. Oh... as for that house over there, that's where Mr. Luan, myself, Mr. Noppol and Mr. Satawat stay. If there's anything, don't be shy. Call anytime. I believe that we've trouble you enough for today. Thank you very much for showing us around. No worries... Oh, Ms. Gaysorn. I almost forgot, if you ever need anything then don't be shy. Mr. Luan asked me to remind you of that. Oh, thank you very much. Then, I'm off. Oh, I forgot to tell you that the ghosts in this house are vicious. They made it so we couldn't stay. We had to move over there, but I know that ghosts leave beautiful women like you alone. Enjoy yourselves. Enjoy. I'll be on my way. Fat ass! Hmm... look. They've put us right next to their house. I'm so bored of men trying to woo us with their looks, words and actions, especially these teachers. The way they look at you, I don't even want to say it... looking you up and down. Especially them... Mr. Luan. How crude! He's just a pervert. I ask you why wear a wig? I couldn't tell it was a wig. Could you? It's just shit that climbed from his ass to his head! Look, Sompat, there must be something good about him. Try to see people from other viewpoints. No, my viewpoint is fine. As clear as day. Look consider this. They tell us this house is haunted and then force us to stay here. Then they move into the house over there. Gah! If that's not selfish then I don't know what is. Hmm... wasn't he joking? Huh? That wasn't a joke. Another thing is they built this connection ramp. I think at night when it was really dark when we aren't watching and I'm in my nightclothes and some are pretty sexy they'll come around for a peek. Don't you think so? Hmm... maybe. Another thing is that when they walk by just stay away from them. When you're alone and I'm not around you'd better be careful. These men can't be trusted. You're so innocent like smiling at everyone you can't outwit them. I worry about you. Yes, Sompat. I know. Look, that's the reason I don't have a lover. Even Madame Kuhlab and Ms. Bunrod don't have lovers. Neither should you. Understand? Hmm... if you have a lover I'll be disappointed in you. Anyway, I don't think you'll get one very soon. I'm much prettier than you and I don't even have one. I think Ms. Sompat is problematic, throwing around her power on the first day. We can't stand for this. Don't you think so? She's beautiful. Cute, like an angel. So delicate. Oh Lord, please find me a wife. OK, good. Noi! You know? I've never tried anything like this before, making a beautiful girl mine to adore. Whoa! You sound like a poet. That'll grab her! Type it... Type it now! Ha Ha! Even though the sun is bright, it's not as bright as me. Sir, be careful, Ms. Gaysorn might not understand. She may think the shine is the sun reflecting off your head. What? Noi! Type it! Write what I said. Type! Look! Your first day and you have a desk full of love letters, Gaysorn. These men are ridiculous. Instead of making use of their time, they sit there and write silly love letters. How despicable! Excuse me. I hope we aren't disturbing you. Not at all. Come in. I want to introduce you to some friends. Gatin. Opchey. Good morning. Pleased to meet you. I brought something for you. Sweet Singapore coconut noodles. I bought them at a stall near the theater. They make them well there. Thank you. Panich Store. As for mine... fried banana from a stall at Chanasongkram Temple It's very tasty. Thank you. They're delicious. Try them. Oh! Look at all those letters. Only a beautiful woman like you would get so many letters on her first day. Ahem! Ms. Mali, I think you should stop talking about those letters. It's almost time for morning assembly. Shouldn't you watch the children? Yes. There's still a little more time. It's not time yet for assembly. Don't you have any letters, Ms. Sompat? I must go watch the children. It's time to go. Let's go. Let's go. Ms. Sompat... that's a nice blouse. Goodbye. Thailand unites flesh and blood of Thais. Nation of the people, belonging to the Thais in every part. Long maintained the independence... Wow, they're pretty. They're here. Hey, Payab... Payab! Hurry up and look at this! Hey! Nowadays, our school is full of guys with long hair. Hey, they aren't laughing. Never mind, just go. Oh, but they're cute. So cute. We'll get 'em next time. Students, greet the teachers. Good morning. I understand that this is the first day, but greetings aren't that difficult, right? Good. Don't let it happen again. Good morning, students. Today, we'll be your homeroom teachers. This is Ms. Gaysorn and I'm Ms. Sompat. Your name is Som-what? Some-butt or Some-booty? How about some-body is gonna get punished!? Punish someone else! You can't punish us! Really? Looking for something? I don't understand why the male teachers here are acting so weird. They're not fit to be teachers. It's been this way forever. There's a story behind all of them. I'll tell you more tonight. Great. Baldy Luan! Say it! Baldy, baldy Luan, Watch my lips... Baldy baldy Luan! Baldy Luan! Baldy Luan! The story behind the men at school is so long, that I'll have to move in with you to tell it. Come sit down. I bought some noodles and dumplings. They're hot. The story behind the male teachers is like this, I'll tell you. Hold on a second, Ms. Mali. Umm... Your accent is very strange. It's not strange. I've talked like this since I was a child. As far as I understand it, you teach Thai at this school. Yes, and I'm good. When... when I'm at school, I have to teach Thai so I articulate clearly, but at home, I speak like my Chinese ancestors. My grandma said not to forget my lineage. Let's not talk about me, let's talk about the teachers at school. Mr. Luan is a player. He can't help but flirt. Mr. Noi, is his consultant. He likes to instigate fights. Mr. Satawat and Nopol, they like to act like westerners. What? They like the western life... they like to act modern. As for Ombadin, Puawadol and Siiharach, they're foul-mouthed fools. Huh? They're vulgar and not worth knowing. They look down on women. They like to torment women and oppress them. Doing this, makes the students disrespect us. It infuriates me. There's one man... Mr. Apidech... who's really nice. Really nice... Then when you two came, Ms. Sompat and Ms. Gaysorn, you opened our eyes and gave us new hope. From now on, I'll fight back and I won't be oppressed by men. I'll be like you two, Ms. Sompat, Ms. Gaysorn. Freedom is here! Freedom! I've been waiting a long time for this. La la la la la la... - Is she insane or what? - Insane... La la la la la.... Freedom? Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! She's going to kill us! Sompat, we are here, so the children can become friends. If they don't learn to get along, then have we achieved the objective of a co-educational school? I know, but try noticing how the boys look at our girls. Frankly speaking, it worries me. Look, it's up to us to look after them and our girls are not easily shaken. More importantly, they have you. What are you afraid of? Come. Look at my class schedule. I don't know what to do with it. What did you do with yours? See. In the morning, should I teach math? Is it too stressful? It'll be OK and follow it with social studies. By having the boys sit with the girls, they can get to know themselves and help each other study. It'll help what the Ministry of Education is hoping to achieve. Sitting in pairs simply means you're friends. Boys and girls can be friends. You don't need to be anything more than just friends. I hope that all of you boys will act like gentlemen and respect the person sitting next to you. Are you hungry? This dormitory... is very haunted! The nobleman who owned this house is very possessive about his things. Thieves once broke in and the ghost killed them all. Sometimes you hear a voice say... "Give me what's mine!" Just talking about it gives me the shivers. Children... Where did they all go? Happy Birthday... May you have the things that you've always dreamed of. May you be happy every day. May you be wealthy. May you find love. May you fulfill your dreams and live a long and healthy life. As the class representative, I wish you both a happy birthday and we promise to be your best students, always. Happy Birthday! Oh, thank you. Promise me we'll stay friends forever. Yes, I promise. We think so much alike. Thai language is a tonal language. That means Thai, has high and low tones... similar to music. If we read literature with a little melody, then we can hear the music in our language. Listen as I read. You needn't bend down far, to scoop water from the stream with a leaf. By the time I get to hug you, you'll have to go home. For now, my arm goes numb as you rest your head on it. Can I help you? Umm... I'm... waiting for the bathroom. No... I mean, I'm waiting to teach. Oh, then why don't you come wait inside? That's quite alright. I should... uh... go to the bathroom first. She's meant to be my wife. So, please help me. How do I make Ms. Gaysorn love me? Love who? I can help you, but that witch, Sompat is always with Gaysorn. Alright, then just for you. Oh my God! Hello, Ms. Mali. I want... I want to be near you. Hello, Ms. Gaysorn. All alone? Where is Ms. Sompat? Here's a letter from someone enchanted by you. I saw it in the teacher's lounge, so I brought it over. Thank you very much, Mali. Um... Ms. Gaysorn, aren't you going to read it? I'm not interested. I'm sorry for being rude... I've never seen what men put in love letters before. May I read it? Go ahead. Should I? Which one should I read? Here... this one. I'll read it. Should I do this? Reading another person's mail... You are... You're a star in the heavens. I'm building a staircase so I can reach you. I want to be near you. My heart is racing... I just want to gaze into your eyes... just once. How profound. Look... he's so modest. He only hopes to gaze into your eyes. Gaysorn, look. This verse is so sweet. All the right words. He's so bright. I think the person who wrote this must be the romantic type. Look... such nice handwriting. It's so smooth. They say that a person who writes smoothly, is sincere, well-mannered and honest. Someone like this is very worthy. Do you need anything else from me? No, that's all. To Mr. Apridech... with Love Revolutionary Council Commandment, Article 1, comes at a time when Thailand is plagued by many problems and the Revolutionary Council will not just sit idly by. The Revolutionary Council, lead by His Excellency Sarit Thanarat, is clamping down on hooligans and has ordered statute 17 to go into effect immediately. I must call this meeting today in order to ask you to help teach the students to stop fighting. Baldy-baldy Luan! Baldy-baldy Luan! Baldy-baldy Luan! Baldy-baldy Luan! Otherwise they'll be charged with disorderly conduct. Apridech, you're the head teacher... Yes. Baldy-baldy Luan! Baldy-baldy Luan! Umm. Sir, and how about school activities, must we cancel those? I mean parties and things like that. The revolutionary council will not interfere with the happiness of the city. Just try not to fight. Baldy-baldy! Baldy-Luan! What are you waiting for? Go teach your students! Gah! Oh, Ms. Gaysorn, please go teach. Baldy-baldy Luan! Baldy-baldy Luan! Baldy-baldy Luan! Baldy-baldy Luan! Sir, I didn't teach him to say that. I heard that! Damn bird... Look... really... I... hey... At least I have more hair than you. See? Look! Don't you see? Go cook it! The man who's been sending you letters everyday, wants to reveal himself. Don't you want to meet him? Yes, of course I want to meet him. That way I can complain to his face. Why do you want to complain? Mali, think about it, if he's not brave enough to flirt with one woman, then how can he be a leader? Oh, you want him to lead you? That must mean you've started to like him. That's ridiculous! Ridiculous? You're talking nonsense. Look at your cheeks... they're the same color as my handkerchief. That's ridiculous! Ridiculous? You're eyes don't lie. Your cheeks are red. They're the same colour as my handkerchief. Oh! That was close. Want to go to the party at the Sand Pagoda tomorrow? I'd like to take the children somewhere. Want to go? OK. I'll go. And Mali? Of course, I've always wanted to go to the desert. It's the Sand Pagoda, not the desert. - Whatever, I just like sand! - I'll go. How about you? What were you two talking about? You were really laughing a lot. Oh, oh... we were talking about muffins. Huh? Yes, we were saying, when making muffins, you have to knead the dough, but if you are giving it to a monk, then you have to add red coloring. Knead it some more and it comes out red! That's when I started laughing like you said. That's all we were talking about. Come on... Wow! Oh my God, Mr. Luan. Wow! Wow. Look! Oh my God... Mr. Luan. Oh! Sir... Oh! Come on. Mali, don't you think we should go and see Sompat? Forget Sompat. Let the monkeys watch the children. You mean let them watch the monkeys? Kids watching monkeys then. Hurry. Shouldn't we stay with them? No. Come on. Wait, wait. I haven't got on yet. - Are you really going on that? - Yes OK, then you go on ahead. I'm afraid of heights. OK, fine. Have fun! When I get back, I'll tell you about it.. Oh, you're not afraid. No. It's fun. Go ahead. Tell me about it after you get off. Let me off! Not so fast! Stop! Bye-bye Mali. Go faster, so you can get over your fear. You're not riding the Ferris wheel with them? Oh, it's better to let them ride alone. It's more fun. What about you? I'm looking for someone. "My star in the heavens" I'm looking for my star. It was you. Ms. Gaysorn, I'll treasure this memory forever. Wait, stop! Stop! Please stop! Let me show you how to throw. You call that a throw? I can do it! I really can! Alright, back up. I'll show you! Forget it. I'm not playing anymore. Oh Mr. Luan? Good evening, ladies. Please come again. We'll be back. My heart skipped a beat. Ms. Mali, what do you want to see? I want to see a sex show. There's the sex show. Oh my God! Mr. Luan, what's wrong? My name isn't Mr. Luan. My name is Somchet. Huh? Mr. Luan! Nappol, I was just passing by Bang Loi. The girls there are beautiful. Really! Show me? Where? Over there. Where? Step right up. Come one, come all. Step right up. Come one, come all. Adults 50 satang, kids half price. Step this way. Come in. Come in. What's your problem? What? What are you gonna do? What? Hey baby, do you think we should fight him? Paayap! Oh... thank God. Hey! You want to start something with my teachers? Asshole! Paayap! Hey, asshole! Paayap! Are they gangsters? What happened? - He was harassing me. - Calm down. Um... I apologize on behalf of my students. Apologize? Hey Ass-breath, you think you're tough? How dare you! I don't think that we should fight in a temple. I can see stars. I'd like you to consider what's fair. You said yourself, not to fight. In the end, it was the head teacher who made trouble. I take full responsibility, and I've decided to resign from the position of head teacher. If you resign, then who will be the head teacher in your place? Exactly? I recommend Ms. Sompat. Ms. Sompat was the head teacher at Darunee Girl's School. Unacceptable. How can we let a woman be head teacher at a boy's school. Yes, that right. The students won't accept it. Sex show. Mr. Luan... What? I think we should let Ms. Sompat be head teacher. We can't. How could we do that? If we offend her... she'll tell the Ministry that we were at a sex show. We'll be ruined. Then it's settled. Our school will have a sex show! Oops! The head teacher will be a woman. Ms. Sompat, is the new head teacher. As the new head teacher, I'd like to inform everyone that I will punish students who fight. I will issue demerits and prohibit them from taking exams. As long as I'm head teacher, these regulations will stand and order will be maintained. Don't over exert yourself. Get some rest or you may get sick. Thank you. I'm worried about the students I'm afraid there are too many emotions we can't control them. Hmm, what are you thinking? I'm afraid the girls will start imitating western girls. Those girls lose their virginity so early on and if Thai girls change as I think what would we do? Hmm... Sompat... Aren't you over-worrying? Not at all and I'm glad you brought it up. Promise you won't fall in love. You're my friend. Think about it. If we had lovers, it would be a bad example for the kids. OK, I won't have a boyfriend. Good. You should go to bed. I need to prepare for tomorrow. I intend to make this school a good example of co-educational schools for the next generation. "I'm filled with the joy our lord has given us. Merits from our past, give us bliss today arid destiny has drawn us together" Ha, ha... it's perfect. Oh, Mr. Luan What? I think "drawn us together" is a bit to strong. "Brought us together" would be better. Hmm... brought us together. Not bad... write it down. Write it down, brought us together. Tomorrow I'll take you to lunch in Chinatown. Fantastic! Thank you sir. Final exams are in a couple of months. I want all students to study hard and remain diligent. Don't waste your time with silly activities. The same goes for the teachers. Don't set a bad example for the students. For example, writing love letters. Today I received one. I'll read it to you even though it's complete drivel. Ever since destiny brought you here, I've told myself... That's our letter! I know! I won't let a little star like you be alone and forlorn in solitude. I want to throw up! I'd like to state silly men who write these letters will never win a woman like that. Remember that! Oh my... She's talking to us, Mr. Luan. I know! She's gone overboard reading Mr. Luan's letter in front of the students. It's a good thing she didn't read my letter. Otherwise I could never show my face in public again. What about Sompat then? Are we going to let her use her power to keep us oppressed? No way! I have a plan. The men must win. We'll work together so our boys must outscore their girls. Yes... We must be better than the female teachers. Yes... Like it used to be. Yes... We must show our pride as men. Everything was peaceful until they showed up. All men are the same. They've got high aspirations but low enthusiasm. They'll never make it. Right! Although I believe that if they can help really help the students, then wouldn't it benefit both the students and the school? Yes, if they can educate the students it would be good for the school. I think it's good. Either way, the girls must win. Especially our girls, because they were born to succeed. Just like me. Today we'll have a competition between the girls and the boys. Whoever loses must clean the classroom. OK? OK then, first question. Petchara, how many provinces does Thailand have? Correct! Paayap, where does the name Bangkok come from? From the Bangkok district! I didn't say he was correct, but he's right. Daoreuang, what's the population of Thailand? Correct. The Pratomrachananusorn Bridge. The 6th King. His Excellency Piboon Songkram Bangkok-Paknam His Excellency Sarit Thanarat. Correct. Supaap, when was Victory Monument constructed? I think it was in year 1857, madam. Am I right? Correct! You've answered every question correctly. It's a tie. Therefore, everyone must help clean. I love you as much as an elephant. You're very cute. Ms. Sompat Oops! Supaap, wake up. Is it time to go home? No, I'm tying to explain the Kingdom of Ayudhya. Take notes! The Governor of Chiang Rai... How impressive. The boys and girls are getting along. They're friends. Yes. The co-ed school is a success. The students are all friends, so how about us? Read it by candlelight. Where are you going, all dressed up like that? Actually, Mr. Sattawat asked me to dinner. Want to come? No. Didn't we talk about this? If we fall in love the students will copy us. Do you think the children will obey us then? Sompat, you have to accept it this is my life. As for being a teacher, that's my job and I've never failed at my job. You must be able to separate the two. Separate them? Do you remember what Ms. Bunrod said to us? When you're a teacher you're a teacher for life. If you enter this profession, you become a role model for children. I beg you. Sompat, this is my personal life. Please let me make my own decisions. What's wrong? Isn't the food to your liking? We can go somewhere else. Oh, that's OK. I just keep thinking about something that happened earlier. Mr. Luan, Mr. Luan! Come look, hurry! Huh? What? Don't you see? Mr. Satawat and Ms. Gaysorn. Oh no! Mr. Luan. I think they must be a couple for sure. Ahh... Ahh... I see them. It's all over. Mr. Luan. Let it out. Let it out, Mr. Luan. So that tomorrow, you won't have anymore tears left to show. So, did you have fun? Was the food good? Reasonable. Next time I'll take you and Ms. Mali there. You seem tired. Go take a bath and then we'll talk about the annual handicraft fair. Annual Handicraft Fair 1957 Hey, I want to eat here. It looks really good. How much for this, sweetie? Here's a whole baht. I want 3 of these. Hey! Stop it. Let go! This way, please. Hey. The teacher is coming. The teacher is coming. Ma'am, I didn't do anything wrong. Teacher, please help us. Ma'am. Help us. Please help us Ma'am. We've come to pay your bail. Yes! Thank you. Thank you, Ma'am. They did nothing wrong, so why should they be suspended and prohibited to take final exams? Right or wrong, if students fight they're considered hooligans. The government stated such in statute 11. The Ministry orders the boys to forfeit their final exams. Sompat, I think you should inform the Ministry. Yes. Think of the students. They're our students. I told you already. I can't let them take the exam. I think we should find Mr. Luan. Sir, I think... Allow me to decide on this issue. Yes, sir. I'll ty to talk to the Ministry. You don't need to worry, because these students are mine too. I feel so bad for them. I don't understand why Ms. Sompat won't help them. She's the head teacher so why can't she help? Yeah, I agree. Ms. Sompat didn't even help us. If those boys hadn't helped us then who knows what would have happened to us. I know. I agree with you. Why won't Ms. Sompat help? Maybe this is beyond her. I believe Ms. Sompat is scared she might be responsible, so she refuses to help. I really want to know what her heart is really made of. Exactly! She's so mean! I understand you. Rules are rules. But sometimes we can't go by the rules. Those boys are still our students. They've been barred from the exams. I can't help them. Whether you can or can't isn't important. What is important is whether you try or not. You're doing your job. As for me and the students, and the other teachers we're doing our jobs too. Our job is as teachers and as friends, but I must respect the standards. Sompat, my friend, there are no standards. Friendship doesn't separate boys from girls. Friends only know love, relationships and friendships. Just like us, sometimes we don't agree, but we still love each other, relate to each other, care about and look after one another. Do you think there are any standards governing our friendship preventing us from being best friends or forcing us to separate? If we can be best friends, relate to each other and care for each other then kids also have the right to love one another. Care for each other and have relationships. If you had a group of close friends and they were drowning splashing around, unable to breathe would you and your friends just sit on the bank singing songs? Department of Education There is the heart of a teacher, even though she comes across as a monster, she is still made of solid gold. People who aren't teachers won't understand how it feels to punish a student and then cry themselves. They don't get it. I'm so happy you understand me. Can you please help? Yes. I've already sent the names. Whether the Ministry will concede or not, I don't know. I beg you please let the boys take their final exams. No matter what happens, I will take full responsibility, because everything that happened is my fault. I'm the head teacher. I was involved, but I couldn't resolve the situation in a proper manner. If anyone needs to be punished, it's me, not the students. To gain something, you must also lose something, Sompat. I know. Just let the boys take their exams. I give up. OK, then. I will report to the Ministry, but I don't know the outcome. Sompat, you're a good teacher. I'm very proud of you. Ms. Gaysorn... We request permission to enter the exam room. We thank you very much, Sir. If it weren't for you, the students wouldn't have taken their finals. It wasn't me. I didn't do anything. The person who did help is leaving us. Thank you very much, Ma'am. Get up. Everyone stand up. Be good. Thank you. Remember what I taught you. Yes, Ma'am. Ma'am. We're sorry that we misunderstood you. Look after your Friends for me. Take care of everyone, Miss Saranyaa. Yes, Ma'am. I'm so very proud of you, Sompat. Gaysorn, I'm not suitable for this school. I'm too strict. Wherever I go, students are afraid of me. Some students may even hate me, but you understand that I really care about them. I'm afraid that one day students and teachers won't respect each other anymore. I fear that once we help them to grow up to be adults they'll see us differently and we won't keep in touch. But I'm happy about one thing, that co-ed schools are now a reality. But Gaysorn, I'm worried about one other thing... What's that? I'm worried about love amongst students. If we don't control it now and we just let it grow we'll lose control of it forever. I understand. You're a good teacher, Sompat. Gaysorn, you're suitable for this school even though I won't be here. Look after the students well. Look after them for me. I won't have the opportunity to do so. Watch them grow up into adults. At least here you found love Gaysorn, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry for getting involved in your affairs. Take good care of your love. Take care of our students, so they grow up to be good people. Promise me. Promise.
