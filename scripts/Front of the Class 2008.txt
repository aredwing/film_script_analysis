Well, they called me everything from spaz to freak. I didn't have many friends actually. But I did have a constant companion. I can barely remember a time, when it wasn't there. Now sometimes, it wasn't a problem for me. Other times, it was. Drop what? Drop books? Stop it. Are you scared Brad? What's wrong? Leave me alone. Fight! Fight! Fight! What is going on! Com'on. Bring it on! Stop. Stop that fighting right now! Stop! Get back to class! Stop that nonsense. You are in big trouble, mister. The girl fell in the mud and got dirty. One thing my Constant Companion and, I agreed on was that we hated school. I couldn't wait until I got out. No more homework, no more books, no more teachers' dirty looks. My Companion first showed up, when I was six but it was years before it had a name. Now the shrinks said I was just hyper I made funny noises and acted, weird to draw attention to myself. It was just a phase: I'd grow out of it and be "normal". . . like everybody else. Through it all, my constant companion stuck with me. Now, to my friends, I'm just regular, ole Brad. The guy who likes baseball. And who loves cheesy 80s music. Which they think is much weirder, than the noises I make. Afternoon, officer. Was I speeding? Twelve miles over the limit. St. Louis, huh? You a tourist? No, I live in Atlanta now, I just moved here. I guess I was a little distracted... Son, you been drinking...? No. No, sir. I have Tourette Syndrome. Take it easy, son. I'm going to need you to sign this. So. What kind of job you looking for? Teaching. I'm going to be a teacher. I get that look a lot but I never let it get to me. I see you've got a B. A. from Bradley University that's in Illinois, isn't it? Yes, ma'am ! Graduated cum laude, high recommendations, your student teaching evals are outstanding, excellent. What made you decide to go into teaching? It's all I've ever wanted to do. I feel like I was born to teach. Why choose Atlanta? I mean...Missouri's your home. I'm thinking of becoming a Braves fan. So, ahh... Georgia honors my Illinois teaching certificate. Plus I fell in love with Atlanta when I worked down here as a camp counselor. I live here now. So does my Dad and my Stepmom. Well, it's nice to have family here to...give you support. Maybe we should talk about the elephant. Elephant? In the room: my Tourette's. No. The Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't allow me to ask you. . . I know, but I'd like to tell you just like I tell the kids in my classes. See, I explain to them that it's a brain thing that causes me to make strange noises they're like sneezes, irrepressible. When you have to, you have to. How do they react? Once they understand, they're fine with it. It's never caused any problems in a classroom. All I want is a chance. Just get me the interviews, and let me prove to them that I can do the job. The Americans with Disabilities Act says I'm entitled to a chance. Ron! Hey, how'd it go? Oh, you know: ''Who wants a teacher that barks like a dog? You should try another line of work. '' Are you serious? Didn't they look at your resume? You're kidding. They're setting up interviews with some principals. Fantastic! When? Oh, I don't know. I've gotta wait for their calls. Get changed we gotta go celebrate. Haven't you got a date? I'll see if she's got a friend. It's about time you started meeting some chicks. I can't focus on dating right now. Has anybody ever tell you you're obsessive? Only every shrink I ever saw. Well, have fun focusing. Oh your Dad called again. Maybe you should call him back, you know? All right. I'll see you later. Returning Dad's call? I'd have to prepare for that. See, Mom and Dad had divorced when I was a little kid and my relationship with Dad had always been umm, let's just say complicated? I mean, I wore out his patience like nails on a chalkboard. It didn't help that my brother Jeff was also a little hyper. Dad said he's waiting to get back to his home in Atlanta, he's waiting to say goodbye Goodbye! You're gonna make him mad! Come on I'll race you! Against The Green Dragon? You gotta be kidding Sucker! Cheater! Short cut! You got a bike. See you, Jeff. Hey! That's not fair! Aw, com'on! Jeff! You're not going to beat me! See, I'm gonna win. That's not fair! You got a bike! Oh, no you're not! Oh, no! You are! Hey guys! quiet down, you guys, quiet down. We do have neighbors you know. Come here. See, I did beat you. Yeah. Calm down. Brad, com'ere. Com'on honey, focus, would you? Com'ere. Come here! Stand here. Listen. Listen up. Focus, please. All right? I need you guys to do me a favor. I want you both to make life a little easier for your mom, okay? You are driving her nuts. Guys, listen! Hey, hey. Stop it! Brad! Help her out around the house but most of all let us stop the obnoxious behavior, OK? Hey, listen. I mean it! OK? Quit the clowning. Your brother may think its funny, but I don't. I can't help it. Yes, you can. There's nothing wrong with you that a little self-control wouldn't fix. Now, stop it. Norman? Yeah! They're not going to hold that plane for you. Okay, all right. Gimme a hug. See you, Dad! Bye-bye, J-man I love you, Dad. Love you too, kiddo. Hey, listen up we'll stay at my house next time. OK? OK! I'll get tickets to a Braves' game. And Brad, remember what we talked about: Selfcontrol. All right? Need any help with anything, Mom? Well... now that you mention it... After the divorce, Jeff and I helped Mom with her new business. Sort of a high class traveling boutique. Well, maybe helped isn't exactly the right word. Oh, Ellen, these things are exquisite! You never find styles like this in St. Louis. Well, it is direct from California. Beverly Hills. This is what everyone is wearing. Look at this. Boys? Boys! Hide and seek? Count. One... Now, Ellen, I don't want to see anything in double-digits. Oh, honey, everything in California runs small. Go ahead. Just try it on. Brad, would you please calm down? He's barking like a dog, for goodness sake! Now look. Don't take this the wrong way you know I wouldn't say this to you if we weren't friends but have you considered an exorcist? You know, I think you might have to face. the fact that you're a size 12. I can cut the label, if it makes you feel better. It's a new doctor let's just listen to what he has to say. I know what he'll have to say. Do you feel any anger toward your mother, because of the divorce, Brad? No. No. Do you resent your father because he doesn't live with you anymore? No. Do you blame yourself for the divorce, Brad? It happened when I was a little kid, I don't even remember it. Mrs. Chen, Brad has some serious denial issues regarding the divorce. What he needs at home are some clear boundaries. He needs to understand that this behavior is totally unacceptable. And that, Mrs. Cohen, is your job. The hardest part was knowing how tough I made things for Mom. I tried as best as I could for her. Make sure he keeps taking his medication, OK? And for Dad? Strike three! I played sports. On the ball field, I fit right in. I mean, everybody makes funny noises and has strange tics at a baseball game. Go, Bobo! Come on, Brad! Thank you very much. All right. What can l get you? Hey, guys. I got something pretty exciting to tell you. Honey, don't eat so fast. You're gonna get the hiccups. He's always got the hiccups. You're a hiccup! Listen, hey! Would you just relax? . Mom says you're not taking your meds. How are you ever...how are you ever going to calm down if you don't do what the doctor tells you to do? Pills just make it worse. Oh I see. So you're a doctor now, too? He's Dr. Bobo. Shut up! All right, guys, let's eat, guys. I have a very important announcement to make. Guys? Guys! All right. That's it. We're going back to the car. Come on. I'm still hungry You know what would be nice? One day without you acting up. One. Wait up, Dad. So, what's the announcement, Dad? I've been seeing someone. What do you mean seeing somebody? Her name is Diane, and she... Brad, please! Stop doing that! I can't. I mean, nothings' happened yet, but... how would you guys feel about having a stepmom? No way! We've already got a Mom! Well. Now you're gonna have two. I talked to your mom about it and she's fine with it. She said... I said STOP It! STOP It! See, I really couldn't blame Dad for losing it. My tics drove him nuts. Because, like my teachers, he had no name for my strange behavior. Except ''insufferable''. Now, somehow I don't know how, I made okay grades. But, what would take a normal person an hour, took me two. Or three. I mean, I loved learning, but I hated, hated reading. Trying to concentrate brought out the worst in my Constant Companion. Brad? Come up here, please. I know you think you're the class clown, but I've had it with you. I can't help help it. That's what you always say. I don't want to hear any more excuses. Your classmates are trying to study... ...and your clowning makes it impossible. I'm sorry. Don't apologize to me. Apologize to them. Eyes up here, everyone. Sit up straight, please. Brad has something to say to you. I'm sorry l... that you can't study because of me. And? You promise never to make any more silly noises ever again. Promise I won't make any more silly noises ever again. Take your seat. All of you, back to your books. As difficult as this may be for you, Mrs. Cohen, I assure you, the teachers are at their wits end. I understand that, of course... Sharon, would you hold all my calls? but all we... Now, this has got to be the last chance. The very last chance. Brad, look, I sent for your mother because things have just gotten out of control here. Now, she's going to take you home today. You can come back... Can't help it. Sorry, what did you say? He said he can't help it. Right. What if he's telling the truth? You've got a bright boy, Mrs. Cohen, but making excuses for him... Making excuses is not going to help. Now, he needs to use this time to ask himself ... Brad! Com'on. Let's go. ...this question: "Why am I sabotaging myself? " I don't care if they expel me. I hate that school. Well, it's that school or another school. I hate all schools. Why are we going here ? To find some answers. I can't go in the library they'll throw me out. Please, Mom. All right, com'ere. Sit over here. Well, maybe we're just going down the wrong track. Who? All of us. Get off me! Wet Willie! Oh no, wet Willie! I know you're busy, Norman, I won't take up much of your time but I really think you should hear this Boys, keep it down, I'm trying to talk to your Dad! I wanna talk to him! In a minute! Keep it down! Listen. You know, those teachers and that doctor, to them it's all about bad parenting which, of course, comes down to me because I'm the only one who here No. I'm not blaming you, Norman. In fact, I'm going to stop blaming myself. I was talking to a friend and she think the doctors are missing something. I got this stack of medical books from the library. Mom, watch out! And, I've been doing a little... research... Stop saying he just needs more discipline, Norman! Nothing I do helps He is out of control and I'm at the end of my rope Can I talk to Dad? Can you just wait a minute, honey? MOM! All right. But give him back to me when you're done. What is it, Jeffrey? Hey, Dad. Yeah, it was a great game I got two base hits and a walk. Sorry I cause you so much trouble, Mom. I want you to read something in this book I found. It's a medical book that might explain why you make all those noises. I hate reading, Mom Read. "Tourette Syndrome. " That, that's Brad, isn't it? The noises and the twitches... I'll still need to do more tests but, umm, you could be right. We may have been headed down the wrong road, here. I've never actually seen a case of Tourette's before. So at last my Constant Companion had a name... This says there's no cure. But that may have changed. This is an old book That hasn't changed, Mrs. Cohen. I'm very sorry. Yeah, but they're still looking for a cure, right? I mean, they will find one, won't they? They they...have to find... It's OK, Mom. We'll get through this, all right. Oh, come here. SEE? There's a reason, Dad. Joop, joop, I'm not being weird on purpose. Listen, uh, Brad. l, um... All right. Well, it's all I wanted to say. Bye. Finally, my dad believed me. But he never believed in me. That I would succeed. That I could teach. Hello, this is Brad. A dog? Ahh, yes. Yes, ma'am, that's my dog. Ahh, OK. Yes. Yes, I can be there 11am. My very first interview... Great. That sounds great. OK. Thank you. I tried not to over-react. I help in my tics. YES! Waffle, yes! After that first call, I got two more: three interviews with three principals. Needless to say, my Constant Companion was more than a little enthusiastic. Well, I see you only your bachelor's degree. Are you planning to get your Master's? Yes, sir. JOOP! As soon as I can. Well, we don't require it for entry level... -but if you're serious about...-I'm very serious. I want to make teaching my life. I, ahh, I make these noises because I have Tourette Syndrome. I'd like to tell you about it. It's a Neurological disorder where my brain sends mixed signals to my body. It's like a sneeze. It's irrepressible. ...a couple of weeks, and I'll give you a call. OK! OK. Thank you very much. Thanks. Take care. Well. Strike one. But, like Mom always said, don't ever give up. When I was little, Mom never stopped researching because, while there was no cure, there might be ways to live a normal life. It's a church, Mom! Honey, you're not going to have to get a Bible lesson. This is just a support group. Do I have to? You need to connect with other people who have Tourette's. Find out how they live with it. OK? Let's do it. I'm not going in there Honey... I'd never seen anyone with Tourette's before. There were eye blinkers and nose twitchers. Foot stompers and neck jerkers. Some of them yelped and coughed. Is this what I looked like to other people? Come on, Bobo. We're here to learn. Let's start learning. The Americans with Disabilities Act gives us the right to do anything or go anyplace that we want to. But try going to a movie. Or a concert or a restaurant. That law doesn't mean anything when people are yelling at you to shut up. I come home and my parents close the windows and blinds because they don't want the neighbors to see me tic. No one was even trying to be accepted. The audits were out of work. The kids stayed at home. I knew one thing... I didn't want to be like them. Even the coaches on his team wouldn't accept him. Oh, I'd had it. Of course, you're home-schooling, too? No. Brad goes to school like any other kid. These kids are not like any other kids school's a waste of time for them. I took him out at the third grade just to save my sanity. You want my advice... ...you'll do the same. Yep. Thanks. Let's go, Bobo. It's supposed to be a support group! Where's the support? Supposed to just hide away for the rest of your life? I'm really so sorry that I brought you there, honey, let's just forget this I don't want to forget this, Mom. Those people let Tourette's win. I'm never gonna do that. It's difficult to imagine that at the age of twelve I would find a genuine philosophy to live by. But here it was. This defining moment. To always face my adversity head on. When I went to my next interview, I decided to be even more up front. Get the Tourette's stuff out of the way first and then dazzle 'em with my approach to teaching. you seem to have been very successful ...in spite of your Tourette's. I've worked very hard to become the best teacher I can be Thank you for coming in. I'll let you know. Thanks. So much for being up front. For my third interview, I decided to discussing about my Tourette's at all. Each week I like to send home a progress report to my students' parents. Um, I like to give my students a voice in their learning to be hands-on... and interactive in the classroom... but also to keep the parents closely involved! Ron, it was a huge mistake not mentioning my Tourette's. It was, you know, I was trying to hide it Fat chance. Okay, that's the negative No. The negative is you've gotta stop stressing out. You're stressing me out. But the positive is that, hey, the others didn't seem to have a problem with it, right? I just, I gotta wait for a call. The positive is you're coming out with me. My new girlfriend she has a roommate Will you stop trying to set me up? When I am ready to date, I will date. Come on, she heard all about you she still wants to meet you. Oh thanks. Real kind. Listen, I want to relax. OK? I want to watch the Braves. We all want to watch the Braves. Get changed. So, Ron tells me that you're on a big job hunt. How's it going? Ahh, pretty good. Except no one's hired me yet. I guess they're all too busy fighting to get me. You do this? I'm impressed by this. -You should be. -I was not expecting this. That's amazing. But I'm pretty good. You are. So you are really a sports fan? Ah, yes. Big time. Soccer, softball...tennis. Yep, I played a lot in college, but I'm not good enough for the pros. I hear that because I wish I was good enough to be him. Who? Him. Oh, you want to be a mascot? -His name is Homer...-Homer. And it's a lifelong ambition. OK. All right. -Don't look now. -OK. Don't look now, but there's this guy behind us and I don't know what his problem is. He keeps staring. Ahh. I actually get that look a lot. It's a look of envy. He's thinking, "How can l make cool noises like that guy? " You have such a great attitude about your... Bye Homer! Bye. Bye, Ron! Bye. Bye, Homer! Go, Braves! So that must have gone well, huh? Did you ask her out again? Yeah, I asked. But, it's second date syndrome. You know, I'm a great guy, she had a lot of fun, but, umm... Your tics are just too cool for her? Actually, no, she says because my roommate's breath smells so bad. What do you mean? You know what I mean. This is Brad. Ahh, hey, Dad. Yeah, no, Ron, Ron told me you called. I just, ahh, you know, I've been so busy that, ah... No. I haven't had lunch yet. All right, that sounds great. Where do you want to meet? Lunch at Dad's work. He wouldn't have to worry about my noises there. Let me know if you need any more of those trusses, OK? All right. Hey. Hey, Dad. See you found your way. Yeah. Let's grab lunch outside my office. Be a little more private. All right. Diane's wondering when you're gonna come by. I guess you've been pretty busy with the job hunt. Any luck? Still interviewing. How's that going? Are they giving you any trouble with your, uh...? You can say the word, Dad: Tourette's. Some of them are. Some of them aren't. How's your money holding out? I'm not asking you for money. I know that. You never ask me for anything. No. But if you ever do get short, you know you gotta job with me here. I'm going to teach, Dad. OK? I can't let anything get in the way of that. OK. I'm jut saying there's nothing wrong... ...with keeping your options open in case things don't work out. You know, there are other things besides teaching. Not for me. Dad could never understand my optimism. Like when I graduated to middle school. I was really hopeful that things would be different. What's the matter Brad? Eat alone? Make a fresh start. New school. New friends. Same result. Today, we're going to be talking about fractions. Fractions are your friend... Use fractionsin every day life. You just don't realize it. For example, say your mother bakes a pie. She cuts that pie. Cohen! Just go to the principal's office. Not the best way to introduce myself to the principal. What do you think a school's for, Brad? I'm sorry I keep disrupting the class You're not answering my question. What's a school for? To educate, isn't it? To use knowledge to wipe out ignorance? The school orchestra's having a concert this afternoon. You planning on going? No, sir. My tics will ruin the music. I want you to be there. Everybody just keep your seats for a minute, please. Thank you. Did you enjoy the concert? Great job. Did you hear any noises during the quiet parts? YES! Yeah. So did l. They're pretty annoying, aren't they? The person making those noises is Brad Cohen. Come on up here, Brad. Do you like making noises and upsetting people, Brad? No, sir. Then why do you do it? Because I have Tourette Syndrome. What's that? It's a thing in my brain that causes me to make weird noises. But you could control it if you wanted to, right? No, sir. It's a sickness. Well, why can't you just get cured? There isn't any cure. I don't like making noises any more than you like hearing them. They're even worse when I get stressed, when you don't accept that I can't stop them. But when I feel accepted, then they're not so bad. What can we do and I mean everyone in this school What can we do to help you, Brad? I just want to be treated like everybody else. Good job. Go sit down. A few words a little education and it was like opening a door to a brand new world. Now some day, some way, I knew, Tourette's or no Tourette's, I was going to be a teacher. I had no choice but to prove that Tourette's would never get the best of me. lf I quit, I would be agreeing with everyone who ever told me I was barking up the wrong tree. Sorry about the air conditioning. Supposed to already be fixed by now. That's all right. Well, umm, your resume looks okay. And we do have an opening in fifth grade. OK. But I do have to tell you:this is a tough place to work. We've got some really hard cases. Well, I take that as a challenge. I don't believe that any kid is hopeless. You know, they all want to learn you can't ever give up. Let me just... You just gotta find the right way to teach them. Ahh, you got something stuck in your throat? Would you like a drink? I have Tourette Syndrome. I'd like to tell you about it. It's a neurological...Tourette's? Isn't that where you yell out obscenities? That's coprolalia, It's, ahh, it's a rare symptom that a small percentage of people with Tourette's have. -I don't have that. -OK, listen. They did not tell me that you were going to be handicapped. How do you expect to handle a bunch of wild students with a handicap like that? Well. By educating them. By letting them know it's okay to talk about it. -It's okay to ask questions...-These students would laugh at you. Not...not when they understand -it's simply a matter of ...OK. I have seen teachers with disabilities before ... ...but never with what you've got. I just don't see how you could ever teach a class. I can teach! Look at my resume. Look at it! Ok? I was very successful as a student teacher my Tourette's never posed a problem! I can teach! OK. Bottom line:I need somebody now for fifth grade. You want to teach here, you're gonna have to refrain from making these noises in class. You know what? Thank you very much for the interview. But, don't you want the job ? Yes, actually. I want it really bad. But I would never, ever work for a man who doesn't care about his students. So, I'll take my portfolio and, ahh, and take no more of your time. You got a great boss. Well, it was the worst interview I've ever had. All he could see when he looked at me was my Tourette's. That's all any of them see. Well, honey, if they can't see what a great teacher you'd be that is their failure, not yours. Well, it sure seems like my failure. Well, if you say so. You know what? Why don't you just throw in the towel and come home, huh? I'll buy you a ticket. I'm not saying that Really? That sounds like what you're saying. It sounds like you're letting Tourette's win. I am not letting Tourette's win! -Really? -Yes, really! Look, I'm never going to give up, I just... I have to find the right school. You will, Bobo. You will. So, I decided it wasn't Tourette's. I just hadn't found the right school yet. I'd keep barking, and I wasn't quitting until I found that principal. I made a map of every school where I hadn't interviewed. lf the Principal wasn't in, I'd give my resume to a secretary or a janitor, and ask them to drop it off when the principal returned. I didn't care. I needed a job. I wasn't going to stop until I had one. You'll be starting at the bottom, but that's no big deal, that's where I started. And you're working 7 to 4. I told you this is only part time. I need to keep mornings open for interviews. I thought that school had already started. No, not all of them. Well, we'll see what happens. Here are your tools of the trade at least for the time being. Like I said, at the bottom. But every job is important here, and who knows maybe you'll end up liking it. And if you put your time in... Didn't you hear what I just said? I'm only working here until I get a teaching job All that stuff has to go in the dumpster. The hiring season was ending. My interviews had dried up. School had started. I was running out of time and money...and hope. Diane. I gave up on you ever coming to me, so I just came to you. You busy? It was my stepmom, Diane. Trying to build bridges with bagels. Your Dad built his business with his own two hands you can't blame him for wanting you to be a part of it. He's just being a dad. He wants you in his life. So how do you like Atlanta? You meet any nice girls? I'm just saying all the right things, huh? Let me get you a refill Brad. Brad, your dad loves you... ...so much. He just doesn't want to see you get hurt The only thing that hurts is the fact that he has never accepted who I am. See, he's got this idea of a perfect son, who is "normal" and does "normal" things. Well, I'm never gonna be "normal" Well, maybe that's not his idea, Brad. Maybe that's yours. And you're right, you are not normal. You have this gift to teach, and it's not in spite of your Tourette's, it's because of it. I have to go. Hello, this is Brad. Ahh, yes. That's a sheepdog. Yep, Brad. Brad Cohen. Ten o'clock is is perfect for me. Absolutely. OK, great. Raise your hand. Raise your hand! You gotta raise your hand! Come on. You must be Brad Cohen. Hi. I'm Jim Ovbey I'm the Principal around here. And... Hilarie Straka, Assistant Principal. Hi. Come on in the office, Brad. We heard you coming all the way from the parking lot. Hear you've been making the rounds. Twenty-five schools so far. And, uh, here's, here's my resume. Oh. Here. Oh. We can look at that in a minute, Brad. Just come on in, tell us why you want to be a teacher. OK. Well, it's, uh, oh, it's, it's all I ever wanted to be. Ever since I was in school. You must have had some pretty inspiring teachers. Ah, well. I had an inspiring principal Mr. Myer but my teachers, they really only inspired me to be the kind of teachers they never were. What kind of teacher is that? One who makes it possible for a kid to learn even if he's different. In a way, the, the best teacher I ever had was my Tourette's. You, you don't have to talk about that, Brad. No, it's OK. I make a point of being open about it. It's, ah, never off-limits to my students. They can ask me anything they want about it at any time. You must get some pretty interesting questions. Oh, yeah. Sometimes it gets really personal. I hope this question isn't too personal, Brad. Do you make those noises in your sleep? I don't know. I'm asleep. No. No, I don't tic in my sleep. When I'm relaxed, the noises give me a little bit of a break. Like just now. Okay Brad. I want to hear more about your teaching philosophy... Yeah. I'd love to tell you about my teaching philosophy. We talked for nearly two hours, it was the best interview I'd ever had Well, Brad, it was a pleasure to meet you. You, too. You, too. We've still got a few more teachers to interview. But we'll let you know when we've made a decision. Ok, great. Thank you. Thank you... Still, my Constant Companion, as always, warned me not to get my hopes up. But hope is a hard habit to break. I was called one last time to and asked come in and meet with the second grade staff. Oh, so, you student-taught second grade? Oh, I love second grade! The kids are still so open-minded. They're open to everything. Yes, but you do manage to maintain a little discipline, right? While they're being so open? I do let them know what the boundaries are. Yes. So, Brad. What do you think is the most important thing you have to teach? Yeah. Ah, well. Besides the importance of reading and the value of math... that it's okay to be yourself. It's okay to color outside the lines if that's who you are. So it's okay to ignore the boundaries? No, and I didn't... I'm sorry but how can you expect kids to learn when you're doing that all the time? Oh. Come on, Brenda No, no, no. It's OK. It's a valid question. I want to answer it. Before they know me, kids sometimes do think I'm just weird, even scary. But, once I educate them about my Tourette's and they see that Mr. Cohen is a real person who just happens to make funny noises, well, then they accept me as a good teacher. Just like they accept all of you. Well, maybe we should all try to be more like second-graders. Does anyone have any other questions for Mr. Cohen? Brad thanks for coming in. The school will be in touch with you, so just be patient. It's hard to be patient when you feel as though you've blown your last chance. And patience never was my Constant Companion's strong suit I'm guessing you never heard from that school. No, not yet. They're still interviewing. I'm not worried. Okay. Is that supposed to mean? I just said "okay". I know what you mean you don't think anybody would hire me if they had a choice. What are you, a mind-reader now? You know what, Dad? This is gonna be my last day here? Well, why don't you wait and see if you got the job first? I'm gonna get the job, Dad. I just have to stay focused. Why can't you stay focused and realistic at the same time? What's wrong with that? Here. Whoa! Are you all right, man? You'll knock yourself out doing that! What if that happens while you're driving? I'm fine. Uh, yeah, I don't know. You oughta see another doctor. I've seen doctors my whole life, Ron. OK? They don't help. Well, don't you think you need to see somebody? I really don't! So, just. There I was. Waiting for the phone to ring again. I tried to convince myself something good would happen. My kid brother...not exactly what I had in mind. -How are you doing, Bobo? -Jeff, what, what are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me you were coming? You know you're in your boxers, right? Did, ah, Mom send you to check up on me? Why? You need checking up on? No, but... Where do I put my stuff? . That's great. You get the couch. Whoa! Nice clubs, are these new? Ah. They're Dad's, he let me borrow them. Thought maybe you and I could, ah, play a little golf. He got us a tee-time at his club. So, what do you think? Three iron from here, little bro? Hey, by the way, thanks for the round. Thank Dad. Oh, wait, forgot... ...you guys aren't speaking. I don't want to talk about Dad right now. You're just saying that to rattle me because you know I'm going to beat you. I'm serious, Brad, you and Dad gotta start getting along. We get along fine as long as we keep it long distance. Is that why you moved down here? To keep it long distance? I mean, it's not like you have anything to prove to him right? What are you now, Jeff, a shrink? Dr. Jeff, huh? I'm sorry, sir? I'm going to have to ask you to stop making those noises. Look, pal. He's not doing it on purpose, he's got No, no, no. I can handle it, Jeff. I got it. Look, it's just not fair to the other golfers. No, I understand, that, umm, I can't help making these noises because I have Tourette Syndrome. It's a neurological disorder I'd like to tell you about it. You're gonna have to leave the course. I gotta think of the other members. Hey, Joe. Leave the guy alone. He's fine. Hey, man. We're a twosome and our buddies don't appear to be showing. Would you like to join us? lf you don't leave, I'm going to have to call security. OK, OK. Umm... OK. Thanks, guys. Maybe next year, all right? Jeff, come on. Come on, buddy. Thanks. Come on, Jeff, it's not like you haven't seen it before. How can you stand living in a world where everybody's so ignorant? Everybody's not. You saw those golfers back there. They went to bat for me. My life is full of people like that. That's not always been my experience. Well, that's because you're always getting into fights sticking up for me. You and mom. You've always been there for me and my tics. You know what? You're beginning to"tick" me off... race you to the car. -Oh, yeah? What! -Hey! HEY! Sucker! Jeff's visit did give me a break from my worries. And, right after he left, I got a call from the school. The principal wanted to see me in his office. Just like old times. Pretty noisy, huh? And yet somehow the kids manage, don't they? Yes, they do. They do. Hilarie and I discussed you with the teachers. And, we talked about how proud we are of teaching our kids to never let anything hold them back in life. And, Hilarie said that if we're gonna talk the talk, we need to walk the walk. She's waiting to show you your classroom. Welcome. Second grade is overcrowded so we've had to create a new class. Your kids are being taken out of other rooms so some of them might be a little confused. They've already been in school for three weeks. There's your student roster. The fun starts Monday, Brad. Let me know if there's anything you need. I need everything. I looked down at that roster like I was announcing the starting line-up for an all star baseball game. Hilarie, this is, thank you... Hey! We thought you might need these. Hey, everybody, bring them in. Just put them down anywhere. We'll get them arranged. Here, let me help you with that. Thank you! Welcome to Mountain View. Yeah, Mom, it's phenomenal, but, you know, it's taken me so long to get here I still have to remind myself that I'm just at the beginning. Honey, that is, that is wonderful news! That's wonderful. Yes, yes, Mom. It is absolutely wonderful, but, you know, they've only given me a contract for a year. OK? I still have to prove to them that they made the right choice Honey, listen, just take a moment to enjoy this. Oh my gosh. Oh my... Did you call your father? He is gonna be so proud of you. I will, Mom. But, you know, right now, I literally have about two weeks of preparation to do in about two days. And, ah, you know, now that I have the job, I gotta really seriously start working on getting my Master's degree. OK, one thing at a time, all right? Listen. Are there any cute teachers at that school? Mom! What? I want you to be happy. OK, all right, yes. Don't worry I'm working on that, too. I gotta go. Goodbye. You must be Brad... You must be Nancy. Hi, I'm Brad. I know. Right. Of course. I guess I'm a little nervous. Please. This is my first time computer dating. -So...-Oh, yeah. Me too. My mom thinks it's dangerous. Well, yeah, I mean, you never know what kind of weirdo you might meet. But you look pretty normal. So... Good, I'm glad. Actually, look much better than normal. Thank you. So, ahh, I guess we're just supposed to tell each other our life stories. Umm, OK. Do, do... ...you think I could get a, get a cup of coffee first? -Cup of coffee. -Yeah. Right. Yeah! Of course. Coming up. Thanks. Ah. Do you want, like, a muffin? I'm on a diet. But I would love a muffin. My roommate is driving me absolutely crazy. She never makes her bed she's got clothes everywhere she's, like, always blasting her music... ...night and day. But, of course, whenever I want to listen to my music, she's all, like, "you need to keep it down". So what kind of music do you listen to? -Well, umm, -Yeah? Mostly oldies stuff. Especially Sting Oh, I love Sting! Madonna, Bon Jovi, you know Milli Vanilli...? I love Milli Vanilli! Really? Wait. You too? We've gotta be the only two people on earth that love Milli Vanilli. You do not. Yeah! Well, I had a really nice time. Thank you. I shouldn't have had that muffin but... I really enjoyed meeting you. Yeah, me too. OK. Well, thanks again, Brad. I can't believe you! You said she was perfect She was perfect. I just didn't want to ruin it. Oh, by asking to see her again? Oh, right: second date syndrome. So is that gonna be your life? Nothing but first and only dates? How do you ever expect to have a relationship? Maybe I don't. Come on in. Get in there. Come on in. Weirdo! Did your teachers warn you that Mr. Cohen makes funny noises? Yeeesss. She said you have Tour...tour... Tourette Syndrome. OK. Anything you want to know about it, I want you to ask. Yes. Is it catching...? No. Absolutely not. You have to be born with it, like I was. Does it hurt? Well, sometimes, like when my neck jerks. But the noises do not hurt at all. These are great questions, keep 'em coming. And, it's okay to ask me anything about Tourette's yes? Can you go to movies? Yes, I can go to movies, but sometimes I get kicked out and that makes me sad. What's the bunny's name? Waffle Wa Wa Waffle! His name is just Waffle! All right, guys. Any more questions about Tourette's? Anyone? Are they ever gonna make you well, Mr. Cohen? Well. Right now there's no medicine that can cure Tourette's. But, it's okay. Cuz I've learned to accept it and I don't let it run my life. What can't you do? Like...can you not eat? I can eat. OK, I eat a lot. In fact, I can do anything anybody else can do except there is one thing that Mr. Cohen can never do. What? What is it? Tell us Mr. Cohen can never play hide and go seek. Why can't you play hide and seek? Cause they'd hear him, stupid. Well, that's the right answer but it's the wrong words because there won't be any namecalling in Mr. Cohen's class, Excuse me? Where are you going? Bathroom. And what's your name? Thomas. OK. Well, Thomas, if you want to leave your seat, you have to ask for permission. Weirdo. Bye, Mr. Cohen. Bye, Gaylon. Good bye, Mr. Cohen. Bye Heather, I'll see you tomorrow. I really like your class, Mr. Cohen! Oh, well, thank you, Amanda! How are you doing Mr. Wright? I'm fine. Four eyes! Four eyes! Gimme gum! Leave me alone! OK, take him, Thomas. Eli! Thomas! Which one of you guys thinks that you can help me? Huh? I can, I can! All right, all right. Here's the deal. I need to get this ball and put it back in that bin. Why don't you guys shoot for it? Rock, paper, scissor, shoot! Whoa! All right, Eli. You win today. Boom! Ah, man! It's OK, Thomas, you can help him. Sorry I stuck you with Thomas, but he was making my class impossible. He's got a whole alphabet of problems: ADD, ADHD, OCD. You want my advice, you'll pass him on to Special Ed. No. I can't, ah, I can't do that. Oh. See how you feel after he's trashed a few classes. I'll be all right. I just need to get settled. I can't wait for tomorrow. OK. You make more noise than my air horn. Sounds like you got healthy case of Tourette's. I was just kidding with you, son. I've got a dispatcher buddy with TS. You ever need any cross-country hauling, just call for Maxine. Hey, umm. Do you have a card? I wasn't being serious, son. Unless you're in the shipping business. Nah, I teach second grade. -Here's the card. -All right. Maxine gave me a great idea for a geography lesson. Thank you so much, Maxine. You're welcome. Safe trucking. I found myself focusing on teaching all the time. Well, almost... You know what I just realized? What? All ducks have Tourette's. Why is that? I don't know. We're birds of a feather. So, it really doesn't bother you, does it? What? You know what. My Tourette's...my noises. Not when I compare them to the noises other guys make. You know, like, braggers, loud-talkers, egocentric, humor-challenged idiots. Seriously, no. Your noises don't bother me at all. As long as you keep me laughing. Well, don't say that. You know how I get under pressure. Oh, I'm sorry. My Dad has always said I was going to marry somebody who made me laugh. Not that that has anything to do with anything. Say something. Quack. Hey. Don't laugh. That was a serious quack. I got you though. Mr. Cohen! Hey! My Mom said to ask if it's okay. Is what okay, Heather? lf I give this to Waffle. You tell your Mom that I said that's fine. OK? Did he say it was OK? Yeah. Feel OK? Um-Hmm. Yeah? I love you. I love you, too. You have a good day, OK? OK! I'll see you right after school. OK. Bye-bye. Amanda? Is everything all right? I wanna be in your class, Mr. Cohen. You are in my class, Amanda. No. He made them take me out See you after school, honey. OK? It's not fair! Is everything OK? I'm Amanda's teacher, Mr. Cohen. -We met yesterday. Oh, no, no, no. There's nothing wrong. I just have to do what's right for my daughter. Come on, Amanda. Come on. He's concerned about Amanda's ability to concentrate. He just thought that you'd make it a little harder for her. Can't he just give me a chance? We've only just started. I pointed that out. And? He said he was sympathetic but that Amanda needs as he put it a "normal teacher. " Don't take it to heart, Brad. Parents are the hardest part of the job. All right, who can tell me the names of the capitals Maxine and her big red truck have passed through? Anybody? Oh, all these hands! Excuse me. Excuse me. Ah, man. Who do I choose? I don't know. Heather. Atlanta...Nashville...um...Springfield? That's great! Because a lot of people think it's Chicago. And, ah, this is Springfield, right? Noooo. That's Indianapolis. Oh, that's right! So, what am I thinking? This is Springfield. NO! That's Columbus! Springfield's over there, Mr. Cohen. Where is it, Eli? Is it over here? Nooo! Where is Springfield? I don't know. You guys have to point it out to me. Point it out. Point it out. I don't see it there. Ahh! I see it! You're telling me that this is Springfield. Right? YES! You don't have permission to leave your seat, Thomas. That's right. Mr. Cohen has eyes in the back of his head. Go back and sit down, please. And next time, ask. But I need to sharpen my pencil. Now, Thomas. All right, now. Where's Maxine and her bug red truck going to be on Tuesday? ME! ME! See you bright early tomorrow, David. All right. Hey. Remember to walk. I really like your hat, Mr. Cohen. Well, thank you, Heather. I like your hair. It's just short 'cause of the medicine. Bye. Hey, honey! Hi, Mom. Can you wait right here for just a minute? -Sure. -OK. Hey, umm. I've been meaning to come and speak to you about Heather. I think I know... Yeah, umm. We were just reluctant to tell anybody at first. Of course it was only a matter of time before the chemo became obvious, so ... Is she, ah, going to be okay...? Umm. Heather just loves your class. She can't wait to get to school every day. And, umm, I'd be grateful if you kept our secret a little longer. I just don't want her to be singled out. Yeah. Thanks. All right, baby girl. Let's go. Bye! How about...an ice cream? Yeah! OK. Uh-oh. What do you think? What do you think? I already have that one. Looks great on you, though. Hey, what's wrong? Oh, nothing, I'm just focusing on school stuff. Can you focus on me for a minute? Sorry. Hey, hey, hey! Try this one on! It'll make you feel better. -Yeah. -OK. Yes. -Yeah? -Yes! -Really? -Oh my goodness, this suits you. More than you know. I've, ah, decided it's time to go for my master's degree. Wow. Wow, does that, does that mean you'll be going away? No. I'd go locally. Anyhow, I have to pass the entrance test to graduate school first, so... Oh, wait. Isn't that like the SATs? Do you have to take that in a big room with a lot of people? Yeah. They said I could have a room all to myself. Ah, good. Tourette's does have its privileges. Would it bother you if I did go away...? Of course it would. Are you kidding me? Get out of here. Come here, I want to show you something. Crazy. Next! Hey, ah, chchchch, Brad Cohen. Brad Cohen. Here you are, Mr. Cohen. All right, I need you take this packet, and I need you to go right in there. Oh, I'm supposed to have special accommodations I don't have any notation of that. I mean, everybody tests under the same conditions today. OK, yeah, but I called and they said They said They said that I could have a, ah, space to myself You know what? I need you to talk to the administrator about that. His office is right over there. I can't make an exception... ...we're not set up that way They promised and I have the right to special testing accommodations Listen, I'm sorry about your disability but there isn't anything I can do. lf you want to take the test, you need to go in there now Look at me! How could anybody possibly concentrate if I'm in that room? Listen, I have to start the exam, now. Do you need me to call you a doctor...? Isn't there anyone you can call for help? Brad, calm down, I can't understand you... Well, they said you could take it alone? OK. All right. No problem. I'll be right there. Has something happened? You can take the test. And you'll have a room to yourself. What did you say to them? The magic word: lawsuit. I've gotta get to work. Hey, Dad. Yeah? Thanks. Good luck on the test. As it turned out, I needed more than just Dad's good luck. I needed time. With the clock, and my Tourette's, ticking away. I failed to get all the way through the test. Good job, guys. Thomas I am so proud of you. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Wow! Look at that turkey, Heather. Thank you. So. Are you gonna have a big Thanksgiving this year? Uh-huh. Mom says all my grandparents are gonna come. Well, that sounds special. 'Cept when they cry. They try to hide itbut I always see them. Can I pet Waffle? You bet you can pet Waffle. Are you gonna have a good Thanksgiving, Mr. Cohen? Yes, I am. Me and Waffle are going to take a little trip to see my Mom in St. Louis. I know where that is! Well, that is super, Heather. That's exactly where it is. Now, do me a favor, will you? And I'm going to trust you to take good care of my friend Waffle. All right? Sure. And I will be right back. Hi, Amanda. Shouldn't you ja be in your class? All right. Come on, I'll walk you to your room. Why can't I be in your class, Mr. Cohen? Well, ah. Your father had to do what was best for you, Amanda. And you know what? You've got a great teacher. OK...See you later, Mr. Cohen. Busted. Where did you learn those words, Thomas? You know you're not supposed to leave the class without asking. Well, you're going to clean that up. And then, ah, you're on detention: no recess. But you do get an "A" for spelling. You can't read it if you don't open it, Thomas. I hate reading. So do l. You do? Yeah. Reading's really hard for me. It's not hard for you. You're a teacher. You wanna bet? Let's play a game. You be Mr. Cohen trying to read And I'll be Tourette Syndrome. OK? Read this page. "Once upon a time" Keep reading. "...upon a time, there was a" That itches. Does it itch a little bit? All right. Keep reading. "...there was a..." Hey, Thomas! All right. That's hard, isn't it? It's hard to concentrate. That's how hard reading is for me. It's not that hard for you, is it? No. It's easy for me. But...how can you be a teacher if you hate books? Hate books? I don't hate books. Everything in the world is in books. I just have to work extra hard to get it out. I'm not going to give up on you, buddy. OK? And I'm not going to let you give up on yourself. Now keep reading. Right here. "Once upon a time there was a" Mag-magi... Magician. "A magician who met a small boy. A small boy who was trying to pull a big sword out of a big rock. Weird. Why would a sword be in a rock? Well, I don't know, but if you, ah, keep reading, you might just find out. "The magician told the small boy that whoever could pull the sword out of the rock would be the true king." Cool. Keep going. What happens next? Hey. What's wrong? Oh, I'm so nervous. What's there to be nervous about? You're just gonna meet my mom. Thank you. That's, that's helpful. And Jeff...and my aunts and uncles... and anybody I've ever loved...in my entire life. Prepare your self. This is big. I'm ready. Why do I have to prepare myself? . That's right. Prepare yourself. Oh, you're here! Oh, hi! I can't believe I'm finally meeting Nancy. Oh! You're even prettier than I thought Brad has told me so much about you, Mrs. Cohen Oh, Ellen. Well, that's more than he tells me about you Wha-what! What? I tell you all about Nancy. Oh, you never tell me the real stuff. -Come on, Nancy -Bobo, get the bags, honey. Yes, Bobo. Get on that. So, are you exhausted? No. Oh, good. Because we've got a pedicure appointment in an hour. -This is Nancy. -Hi. -Who I was telling you about. -So, nice to meet you. And, no, wait, Janet. Here, come and meet Janet. -OK. Hi! Nancy. -And one other person... Mom's going a little overboard making Nancy feel like family. Is that a possibility? Her being family? I don't know. I mean, you know, I know but I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't... Oh, yeah. It's, it's serious. Has she met Dad? No! No, no, no, no... Well, what are you waiting for? Hey. Back off, will'ya? ...He ended up falling flat and then he hit his head straight against the curb. Gave himself a concussion. Well, You'll excuse me, Nancy's needed in the kitchen. I'm just going to steal her for one second. Needed in the kitchen. OK. Are you rescuing me? Because I don't need rescuing I do. What's going on ? How was your pedicure? lf you're wondering what did your Mom and I talked about, we talked about you. And us. Is something wrong? I was just wondering, if I told you, I love you. I mean, it just, it scares me. Right? I never thought about it before. I never dared think about it. Look, Brad. She understands about your noises, she doesn't care. You know, you make her happy, Brad she told me that, Brad. You make her laugh. Well, what if one day she stops laughing? What if one day she gets fed up of living with someone who I just, I don't want to hurt her, Mom... Maybe you don't want to get hurt. Both. The only thing that can hurt either of you: is if you let Tourette's drive her away from you. lf you let it win. Heather's mother had called to say Heather was no longer able to attend school. So, the class all pitched in to cheer her up Oh, wow. Look at this table. It looks very good. Ah, this looks great over here. The news we'd all been dreading came a few weeks later... Hey. Hi, Mr. Cohen. What's up, Henry. Hi. -Hey, Eli. -Hi, Mr. Cohen. Hey, Mr. Cohen. What's up, Gaylon? These are my grandparents, James and Shirley. Sir, they're about to start the service. You go ahead. Mr. Cohen? Aren't you coming in? I'm sorry...I thought I could but I... I think I'd be too disruptive. You made such a huge difference in Heather's life. You were her favorite teacher. Please, don't leave without saying goodbye to her. Okay, Thomas...what is your team's word? Weird! Weird. Anybody not on Thomas's team know what that word means? Strange. Creepy. Scary. Very good. Who can use the word weird in a sentence? Me, oh, me! 25 30 35 40 25, 30, 35, 40. The girl in pigtails. 50! Gaylon! "I like weird movies. " Sorry, Mr. Cohen. I know you can't go to them because you get thrown out of the movie theater. Well, that's OK, Gaylon. Boom. Because I can rent movies. And I also like weird movies. So weird is a good word, right? But what if someone comes up to you and they say, "Hey, you! " Yeah, you. I'm talking to you. You're weird. Is it still a good word? Noooo. What, what's that? OK, everyone, stay in your seat. It's Maxine and big Red. Mr. Cohen, can't we go see them? Okay, but everyone...inside voices... Everyone line up by the door and no running. You got it. Yeah. Exactly. Eli, get in there, man. All right, but be careful. So, what do you think of it? Pretty cool, huh? Eli! What did I tell you? All right, no pulling the horn. Or else you guys are coming down. Sorry, Maxine. That's all right. Kids will be kids. Yes, yeah. Yeah, they will. They still getting along? Well, it looks like it. Give 'em time. I like Nancy. She reminds me of your Mom when we first met. They don't look anything alike. I'm not talking about looksI'm talking about that... spark, that spirit, that, ah, "je ne sais quoi. " How are things at school? Oh, you know. We got more books than bookcases, roof leaks, budget cutbacks... Little worried they might not ask me back next year. There's plenty of teachers with a lot more experience than me. I'm proud of you regardless. Doesn't feel that way. Why do I feel like you're still embarrassed by me? And it's okay, Dad, you can admit it. You're not trying to start something...? No. No, no. But, you know, we're finally talking, and it's good, so let's talk. I've always been an embarrassment to you. I have, haven't l? Even when you used to come visit me, you used to squirm when all those eyeballs would click my way. You've never been able to accept it. You're right. It is tough being with you sometimes I hate it when we go to restaurants and people give you those looks. Sometimes, I just... I just feel so helpless. You know, I've always been a guy who could fix things... ...but the one thing I could never fix was the one thing that was hurting you most. It doesn't need fixing. Nobody can fix it. I know. I know. But maybe it's my fault. Maybe I gave it to you. I think these babies are done. Come on, guys. We only have two minutes before the media center closes. Hurry up, back there. Stay to the side, guys. Stay to the side. What did I tell you? Guys in the back, come on, hurry up. Dad? What are you, ah, what are you doing here? You said you needed bookcases, didn't you? Your Father's built us new bookshelves for the library. Things are a little slow at the office. This way, gentlemen. Oh, and I got you something for your collection. Put it on, Mr. Cohen. A hard hat for an extremely hard head. Hey, class, that's my dad. Hi, Mr. Cohen! Hi! Come on. Come on! And, and Hilarie didn't say what this was about? No idea. We were at recess and she said she needs to see you in your classroom. I think it might have to do with next year. Here he is. Brad. Would you come over here a moment, please? Hilarie's got an announcement to make. Some of you may have noticed an observer hanging around school the last few weeks. Well, he was here to assess one of our teachers. Mr. Cohen. And I'm here to announce that our very own Brad Cohen has been chosen from amongst all the new educators in the state of Georgia to be Sallie Mae's First Year Teacher of the Year. As I looked at my students, I felt like a kid inside. Because children look at life differently than most audits. They see the world and say, I will. Not I can't. And so did l. This shirt's too tight. The label's digging in my back... I cut out the label. I don't know what you're so nervous about. You're in front of a crowd every day. Well, these aren't second-graders. Now... Oh, man, I wish I was invisible. Well, that is something you'll never have to worry about. Hold still, hold still! I love you. Go, Mr. Cohen! Come on, Bobo, you can get through this Don't worry. He's going to get through it. The noise you just heard is the Tourette Syndrome I've been living with since I was six years old. I'm standing up here today because the love and support of a lot of people put me up here My family, my school family, my students, and all my friends. I owe this award to all of them. But I also owe it to the toughest, and, and most dedicated teacher I ever had: my Constant Companion. My Tourette's. Now, some of you may think that's pretty weird to thank a disability... and calling it a great teacher? That's really weird. I mean, what could I possibly learn from a disability? Yes, Gaylon. You learned to keep going. Eli? You learned to not let it stop you. Yes, Thomas. You learned to not let it win! That's right. Coping with my Tourette's has taught me the most valuable lesson that anyone could ever learn: And that is to never let anything stop you from chasing your dream from working or playing or falling in love. That's right. Coping with my Tourette's has taught me the most valuable lesson... Yes, Thomas. Can you bring that award to show and tell on Monday? You bet.
