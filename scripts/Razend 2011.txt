The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall. Let me see. - I'm not going swimming today, mum. You shouldn't confront him. You know what he's like. Anna. Do you want some aspirin? - Yes. Enough whining. Roosmarijn will make an appearance and I'll see what happens. Yo, Svenny. The magnificent, out of reach Roosmarijn. What shall we not do to get her today? We are not going to ask her out for a movie, nor ask her... I saw Bob in the park yesterday. - What? No. With his girlfriend. I saw them kiss. Really? - Yes. Where? - On a bench. She was very beautiful. She's got long red hair. You'll still be chasing after that girl when I have grandchildren. What I wanted to say, Sven, can you come and film this afternoon? Yes, fine. What time? - At five, at the luncheon bar. I really saw her. - What did you see? Roosmarijn says Bob has a girlfriend. It's about time. - What's her name? I don't know, but I saw them kissing in the park. Heavy. There's only one thing to do: Confront Bob with the truth. Let's harass Bob. Put your books away. That would be too easy. Here you go. There. Mobile phones on vibrate. Only answer it if it's a really good friend. I really felt like doing that. Bob, is this a written test? - Yes, of course it is. You have to grade it. That takes time. - So? Take off your hat. So? Then you can't leave. - Do I want to leave? Yes, of course you do. - Alright guys. It's off then. yesterday. This one is less important. Shall we say 75 euro? Then I'll postpone it for a week. If she finds out she'll break up with you. Who will break up what? - Your sweetheart. I don't have a sweetheart. She was a red girl, wasn't she? - Yes, after she kissed him. No, she had very long hair. - You mean Marjolein. Marjolein can kiss so fine. Marjolein just happens to be my sister. Sister? You said you saw them kiss. - I don't think so. She's my sister. You had your arm around her. - But Roosje... I can put my arm around my sister, can't I? Guys, can I? Roos, did you have anything else to share? No? - Great, Roos. Talking about stupid. - You embarrassed us. And the test. - How did you come up with that? You're spoiling it for everybody. - I didn't know she was his sister. Yes, how could she know? Thanks. My hero would know what to do now: Lights off, spotlights on. And then the violins. That was clumsy of me. - You can see I'm busy. I didn't see the ink well. - Wait. Sorry, I didn't do that on purpose. - You're only making it worse. What a mess. - Get lost. Hold on. Were they about to kiss? It's your own fault. - The old man wants you to come. I'm not going swimming. I told them this morning. You don't have to swim. You can record my laps. I can't do that either. I already have another appointment. I'm late already. I can't see him yet. - He'll be here. I'll bet he's late. - Have a little faith in mankind. He's too damn lazy to hold a stopwatch. Are you okay? - It still hurts a bit. Now go and apologise. - I didn't do anything. Apologise or do you want me to teach you manners as well? He spilled ink all over my drawing. - He's the one who's injured. You're looking at the future junior champion of the Netherlands. Got it? - Yes. I can't hear you. - I'm sorry. He's sorry. Good. Are you off to the pool? - Yes. I don't get it. Did he turn that thing off? Come, let's go. - Let's get out of here. This is taking too long. Thanks, dude. Yes, and go. Good, nice stroke. Okay, chop, slice. Come on, Lennart. Come on. Is this right? It's all your fault. Aren't you going into the water, Sven? No. Damn you, jerk. Hey, Bart. You must be here for Sven? Is he in? - No, he went swimming. I was supposed to meet him. - He must have forgotten. I'll tell him you dropped by. Goodbye. Did they abandon you? - Yes, we were off the first period. I would have stayed in bed. - If I'd been smart. How are you getting on? I'm stuck on this equation. Let me see. Oh, wait. Look. Here you forgot to include the two. You see? Now it's right. - I have to go. I thought you were off. - Toilet. Yes, that's more important than maths. Good luck. Where were you, man? - Sorry, I was completely knocked-out. Can you warn me next time? I had prepared all kinds of stuff. I couldn't get a hold of you. - So, do I get a second chance? Want to bet it was a coincidence? - It didn't feel that way. Bob is fun. - He was touching me, Halima. Where did he touch you? - Well, here. That's your back. - That's my back. This is something else. If I had let him continue... - You'll never know. He probably only wanted to help you with maths. You're imagining things. Just like yesterday. Hello, I saw him in the park. - With his sister. That was nothing after all, wasn't it? We've got French now. Keep him satisfied. He complained last time. He's a bugger. - Give him an extra crate. He likes that. - Yes, mum. Sorry, guys. Hey, man. Did you hurt yourself? - No, I pulled a muscle. We don't feel pain. Look. Pain is gain, blood is good. That's one way of looking at it. Well, bunch of show-offs... Show me what you've got. - Give me the camera. Don't try this at home. Oh, awesome. I didn't know you were a cameraman. - I'm not. But you're filming. - I want to become a director. Is the camera yours? - Yes. So what do you film? - A mental group of free runners. He's still looking for actresses. To be in his film. - Are you making a film? I'm still working on the storyline. I think you would be just right. You look like an actress. What's the story about? - It's not finished yet. It's about a girl. - What happens to the girl? It's a secret. He'll tell you if you come tomorrow. You can audition then as well. Right? - Audition? You need to know whether she can act. - Perhaps she doesn't want to. Of course she does. - An audition. At your place? - My place is no good. I'd prefer to go somewhere else. You can come to my house. - Great. Yes. - Let's move on. See you later. - Bye. I'm home. Hello? Dad? Dad? Where's mum? Mum went aqua jogging. Get away, you. - You can't stay down here. Like you mind. You're a rotten kid. I'm a lousy dad. You're always watching me with those beady little eyes. Has he been drinking again? - Yes, he was lying in the basement. He's going to break his neck one day. Study hard and you'll be fine. Hey, Roos, my little rose. I'm happy to see you. I was grading the test you made the other day. It wasn't very good. How about some tutoring? I already take extra French lessons. - I feel you can do much better. Don't you think so? Why don't you stop by this evening? I can't make it tonight. - Or tomorrow. I can't come tomorrow either. I'd rather not. Mum. Mum, did you see my camera? Dad took it to film Lennart. Sorry? For the preselect ion rounds. - But it's my camera. He's just borrowing it. - This is ridiculous. I need the camera myself. - Then you'll have to go to Haarlem. The selection rounds are in Haarlem? Don't make such a fuss, Sven. You can film every day. The selection rounds are only once. I hope they changed the tape? I don't know. Don't ask me. Why not? I'll go crazy if they haven't changed that tape. Am I late? Oh, right. - I can just... No. No, come in. - Really? I can just... An audition is important. Where's your camera? - I want to work on the storyboard. The what? - The storyboard. Okay. We can go upstairs. I never write a script. I just draw all the shots. Is that how it's always done? - No, not always. It's film. They're moving images, so I tell the story in images. And our story? It's about... A girl. And this girl... runs away from home. She doesn't get along with her parents very well. Why not? - She's always fighting with her parents. And now she has had enough. - Just like that? She met somebody. - A boy? Yes, a boy. She wants to run away with him. He has a motorcycle, this boy. He told her: I'm going to take you with me. She quickly packs her things. In a suitcase. A backpack. A backpack? Okay. A backpack. It's the middle of the night. - Yes. Shouldn't she leave a note? A goodbye note? Yes, that's nice. She puts it on her nightstand. The boy is outside, waiting on his moped. Motorcycle. - Moped. No, motorcycle. - Make it a moped. Why? A moped is so dorky. A motorcycle is much cooler. Okay, a motorcycle. And he honks the horn. - Won't that wake up her parents? Oh, yes. - No, he's not going to do that. He just waits and she silently walks down the stairs. And then she goes outside. - And she closes the door behind her. And then she blows her nose. - Why does she do that? Because she really wants to cry. Is she having second thoughts? - She's determined and she leaves. She gets on the motorcycle and drives off towards a new future. Nice. The end. But you're going to need more actors and somebody with a motorcycle. Arnout's dad has got a motorcycle. It has to be Hakim. - Hakim? Yes, the parents are racists and don't want her to date a Moroccan boy. No, not Hakim. Why not? - Hakim doesn't have a driver's license. He's got a moped. I think it should be more about you. You have to run away during the day. When will we start filming? I'll let you know. And? - We had a nice chat. A what? Chat. - Did I hear the word 'chat'? You're looking at old people sex, Sven. You're not making progress. I practically put her in your arms. I want to hear the sound of clothes ripping. Girls like a bit of romance. Romance? Are you saying I'm not romantic? I understand. That's how you do it. Sven, can you start editing the recording soon? Roosmarijn's? - No, the free running. Yes, I'll let you know. - Okay. we are the champions Your brother made it. That's where balls will get you. Can I have my camera back? - Congratulate your brother. And say hello to granny. - Congratulations. We're celebrating and you're whining about your camera. There was an important tape in it. I hope you didn't erase it. I just rewound it. - Nice, Lennart. I'm proud of you, son. You erased everything. Unfortunately not everything. You're still here. Here, your tape. Could you tell Bob I forgot to bring my biology assignment? What are you talking about? We have biology this afternoon. Get it during the break. - I forgot my keys. My mum is still at home now. And what's this? Don't look at me like that. You've skipped school before. I get it. You're afraid to go to his class. Come on. Hi, girls. Come on in. What's wrong? Halima, stop distracting Roosmarijn, will you? Sorry. Can you make it this afternoon? - Filming? Yes, or... - Yes, yes. Yes, great. At your place? - I'd rather go to yours. Your house is more suitable. Hold on. Here. We basically start in the middle of the film. The girl leaves the house. Then she shuts the door. She walks away and looks back to the house one more time. Then she says goodbye. Okay, do I have to say anything? - No, you don't have to say anything. Your face will tell us everything. Yes? Okay. And action. No, yes. It's fine. I think you should turn the other way. Yes, like that. - Like that? Yes, like that. Yes, turn around like that. Okay? Okay, yes. And action. Action. Action. Okay, Action. Seriously now. It doesn't matter. When you get here you turn around here one more time. But you... - Here? I got stuck there. I thought all I had to do was leave the house. It's so plain. It's film. Nothing is plain. - I'm very plain. You're not. - I stink. No, you're very special. What have you got there? Pain is gain, blood is good. What? You know Bart. All this free running will get you bruised everywhere. Are you involved in that? - Yes, I just started. Cool. I'd like to watch you. You don't have to do it. Nobody is forcing you. Come on, Sven. Come on. A bit longer, come on. Come on, Sven. - No way. It's a four-hour drive. We have to be there by 9 am on Saturday. We have to leave Friday night after dinner. Dad, that's the school party. - Then cancel it. We're going to do it this way. I'm sorry. I already signed you up for the training. - What training? A special training in Germany with a famous coach. I forgot his name, but... - Schumacher. Can't you remember that? When is the training? - Next weekend. That's my birthday. - We'll celebrate another day. I don't want to be in Germany on my birthday. You won't. I see no reason why you should be there. It's no fun but you'll be fine. Do you know how much that training is going to cost me? Over 2000 euro. - I don't believe this. What? - You're leaving me alone on my birthday. How old are you? - You don't even know that much. One day a year. Even that is too much to ask. Don't be so melodramatic. It's not about me anyway. It's all about Lennart. I'm still here too, you know. - Let's make you the focal point. Then we'll all be institutionalised. - What are you talking about? Well, it's... You have everything to do with that. You drive me absolutely crazy. Take it easy. - Bonkers. Wim, calm down. Come on, calm down. Yes, very good. Don't forget to put your hand underneath. After this nobody can get you. - You think so? How is the editing going? As well as the training. - Say no more. There is a problem with the recordings I made. Now you're telling me? What? - We have to shoot them again. Let's do it this weekend. There's a group of good free runners coming. Hello, director. - Hi. Your actress wants to know when we're filming again. Whenever she wants. - Sunday? I'm already filming with Bart. Saturday? - Yes, that's fine. We can go to my place. - Deal. Yes, come on. Camera is rolling. Ladies and gentlemen the future junior champion. Great, man. My hair looks stupid. - That's okay. Lennart, give me a hand. That's good. - That's my camera. It's staying here. I'm taking it. Get used to it. We're going to record every training. And make a documentary of every day? - Yes. I'm going to record every session. - That's impossible. I need the camera myself. - Sven. Buy your own. If you can afford the training, you should be okay. It's mine. - Give it to me. No, I'm not lending you my camera. Come here, you. Hello? Does this feel like a birthday? - Definitely. Are you snivelling? - I'm touched. I've got a surprise for you. - What? We're going swimming. - Swimming? Tomorrow in the pool, and don't tell me you don't feel like it. Everybody's coming, even Roosmarijn. See you tomorrow. Hey, Sven. Congratulations. I am proud to be in your first film. Kisses, Roosmarijn. Jannie Feije. - Granny, can you come and get me? Do you want to go inside? - Can I walk around for a bit? Everything is sore. Why don't you leave it on? Are you going to tell me how it happened? I got beaten up last night by some guys outside the club. Shouldn't you report them? No, I don't know those guys. I didn't get a good look, and who knows what they would do next. You still don't want to see a doctor? - No, it will pass. You sound like an expert. Do you want me to ring your dad? - There's no need. He paid a lot of money for that trip so let them enjoy it. Watch it, here I come. He's not coming. - He's coming. Believe me. He won't let anything stop him. - He should have been here by now. He's always late. It's your birthday but you're an arse if you don't show up for swimming. Cool. A comfortable bed in your grandfather's study. You were never allowed in here before, but now you're big enough. Do you miss granddad a lot? - He's well taken care of. Don't you mind him no longer recognising anybody? Forgetting can be a blessing. Who are those two boys? The one on the right is your father. - And the one on the left? Yes, he looks like you. Same eyes. Yes, but it can't be me. - It's not you. It's a cousin who emigrated to Canada. Try to get some sleep. Tomorrow is another day. Good night, my boy. - Good night. Wim Feije's brother? He never gets any visitors, except for his wife. His son occasionally stopped by in the beginning. Wim? Yes, that's my dad. He fails to show up now. I didn't know he had a grandson. - Two, I've got a brother as well. Don't expect too much. - Thanks. Pain. Yes, it hurts. Richard. No, I'm Sven. I'm Wim's son. Richard. I'm Sven. I'm going to do some cooking for the two of us. I've decided you should stay here until you're presentable again. You can't go to school like this. - I went to see granddad. Did he have a good day? He thought I was Richard. Who's Richard? - I told you about him yesterday. So what's this? My father had a brother, Richard. Is he living in Canada? Why doesn't anybody know about him? Because he's dead. It was summer. A beautiful day. He decided to go swimming in a lake. The water was black. He jumped into the water. It was only two feet deep. It was an accident. He was 15. It was simply a stupid accident. Until the day I die I'll never forgive myself for not stopping him that day. Take it from me that your father also blames himself deep down. My father? My father doesn't even have a heart. Don't talk about your father like that. - Not even when he beats me up? Do you always eat alone? Well, I was going to share but my sister ate them all. But here you are. You can hand them out. I wonder about Sven's excuse. - I guess his sister is ill. You can open it up now. You really need help. This can't go on. You need to resolve this. I do? There are rules that we have to follow. I know, but they're going to do it anyway. A school party should be festive and there should be drinks. The law is clear, Bob: Under 16 no alcohol. Some are over 16. Two teachers are willing to get behind the bar. We don't serve beer to underage pupils. We can't check it. - We know everybody. You get a beer and pass it around in the corridor. No alcohol. I decide. I've done my best. That's obvious. It's not my fault if they start binge drinking in some doorway. We need to replace Astrid for the organising committee. She quit? - She needs more time for school. Roosmarijn once offered to do it. Roosmarijn? - Roos. Yes? I'm not doing it. Bob is in the organising committee. You don't have to. Just tell them no. No problem. No problem? - Just forget about the guy. Think of something nice. Think of Sven. Sven? Yes, that will really cheer me up. He doesn't even cancel appointments. - He's ill. That happens, doesn't it? Go and see how he's doing. And chase after him? I'm here to see Sven. Is he in? No, he's not. Oh, I heard he was ill. It's a school allergy. We wanted to film this weekend. - We were in Germany, so... Sven too? - We dropped him off at his girlfriend's. His girlfriend's? - In Limburg. It was on the way anyway. So Sven says he's going to make a film with you? Yes. Yes, we've already recorded an entire scene. Funny how that always works. What? The film trick. Ask him when he's going to film part two. We were supposed to do that this weekend. You see? You all fall for it. - What? Promises of a film and a lead but there's not going to be any film. He's my brother, but he doesn't really respect girls. I'm going back. My mother is going to pick me up. You know you can stay here, right? Granny, thanks for everything. I'm glad you're coming home. Bunch of idiots. You know how often I was waiting for you? How many text messages I sent, messages on Facebook? What's wrong with you, man? Let me guess. You were ill? Let's leave it at that. Just keep it up, Sven. Just keep it up. You're a real friend. Whatever. He's your friend is, isn't he? - Yes. He was my friend. We're leaving the pool now, Sven. Sven, you were supposed to film us. Remember? On Sunday? We were supposed to meet on Saturday. I've been waiting here for hours. Should I call the police or are you dead in the gutter? I haven't heard from you in five days. Roosmarijn, thanks for the card. - No problem. All better again? - What? You were ill for quite some time, weren't you? I really couldn't come to school. - And no means of communication? I was at my granny's and I forgot my mobile phone. Good excuse, being at your granny's. - What? Are you upset? Yes, of course I'm upset. I drop by with a cake on Saturday and Sven is nowhere to be found. Shall we make a new appointment? - For what? Well, to film. - I don't want to film with you anymore. Find somebody else. I was looking for you. Has Susan asked you about the organising committee? Yes. The answer is no. - Why not? Roos, it would be fun. We can get to know each other. I would love to see you more often. I can be very nice. Get your hands off me. I'm never going back to maths again. He'd wish. The bastard has to go. What's with Roosmarijn? - You'll probably be alarmed. It's about Bob. - Is he leaving school? You wouldn't expect it, but he can't keep his hands to himself. Who did he hit? - He keeps touching Roosmarijn. Is that all? He touches everybody. He touches her breasts and her thighs. How? When is he supposed to do that? You know, during class. We would notice, wouldn't we? - He walks up to me when I'm alone. You can just avoid him, can't you? - That's not always easy. Aren't you just mistaking? - Yes, I'm making it all up. Happy now? He has touched her several times now. She's afraid to go to the maths. That's not right, is it? I think we should do something. Let's all talk to Hazelman. Yes, I'm sure he'll believe me if you won't. Yes, that's fine. But then I want to be sure. Should I hang up cameras first? Good one. You have a lively imagination. - What's that? Let your parents take care of this and don't get us involved. What are you doing? You can see how Roosmarijn is feeling. You act as if she's lying. - I'm not saying she's lying... but she tends to see things that aren't there. So you don't believe her? That's pushing it. Bob is a creep and if we don't... - Drop it. You're blind because you're in love with her. Fortunately she's in your film. She has a real sense of drama. Roosmarijn speaking. - Hi, it's Sven. Would you like to see the edit? What edit? - The scene of you leaving the house. Well, no. I'm fine. You're very good. It would be a shame to miss it. Just send me a DVD. With another actress I have to shoot the scene again. That's tough, isn't it? I'd like to finish the film. With you. What do you think? That I'll give in eventually? Sorry. I won't bother you again. Why doesn't he leave me alone? - Because he's in love with you. I have to get something. - Then do. Stop sneaking around. Look at the boy's technique. He learnt that in Germany. He's good. - Yes. He's going to win the race. I could have won too. - You don't like swimming. You think so? What? - That I don't like swimming. You quit, didn't you? - I was really good. I had to quit because you kept beating me. You're ruining it again. What? Do you think nobody notices? You'd have to be blind. - So now it's all my fault? The only one ruining things here is you. - You had it coming. Come here, you. Have you gone mad? Who do we have here? - It's Sven. Come on, guys. Let's go. Aren't you supposed to be in class? - Yes, I am. Maths. - So what are you doing here? I'm not going. - Why not? Did you have an argument with Mr van der Steen? Did he expel you? No, sir. I'd rather not talk about it. That won't do. You're obligated to attend all classes. You need to have a very good reason. - Yes, I have one. Oh, then I'd like to hear it. Now. I want an answer before tomorrow, got it? I'm looking for somebody. - Try a personal ad in the paper. Good idea. I've tried that but nobody replied. Except for my sister, but I'm done with her for now. Sven, that must have been some serious snogging. That girlfriend of yours is quite a hot lady. Now it's your lip but next time... If you know what I mean. You can take it, can't you? You're a guy. Hands off. You're the one who's been touching girls around here. Excuse me? - Pervert. Sorry, can I... - Do you get off on touching them? Well, you're not touching me. - Do you think I fancy you? Yes, just pretend you don't know. - What's going on here? You can't keep your hands to yourself. - Get out. Take your things and get out. Move it. I've had enough of you for today. What a coincidence, so do I. Move it, move it, move it. Throwing things... You'll never guess what just happened. - Hazelman caught me. Do you know what Sven said? - No, and I don't want to know. But Sven... - Hazelman walked up to me. It's very important. - What's important is that I forget Sven. I've got a problem. I told them I no longer want to go to math class. Yes, and now I have to tell him why not. He'll be astonished. Brave of you. Brave? You don't really think that I'm going to tell him, do you? Then what are you going to say? I don't know. You're always full of good ideas. It's time for Hazelman to find out what Bob is doing. I'm going back to math class. - Get real. I'll tell Hazelman that I wanted to study French. But Sven has... - No Sven. No more about Sven. I've had it with that guy. Well, that's just excellent. She made it all up. You're just parroting her. You don't make up something like that. - You know what will happen next? Bob has it in for the entire class. That will affect our grades. That's what you're worried about? Grades? Sven is swooning over his movie star. We are so done with you. Come with me. Did you accuse Mr Van der Steen of sexual harassment? That's right. - Aren't you ashamed? No. - Oh? What do you think? That you can get away with anything? How did you get that lip? - A beating. So that's the type of boy you are. We can't use people like you around here. You will apologise. - I won't. What I said is true. Are you saying that you saw him doing inappropriate things? No. - No? Then what? I heard it. - You heard it? He heard it. From who? From... Well, it's obvious to me. You made the whole thing up. I take this very seriously, Sven. You're suspended. I will inform your parents. Roosmarijn told me. Mr Van der Steen says he has an argument with Roosmarijn. A what? - An argument. And you're taking advantage of it. Boy oh boy. How low can you get? Leave the building right now. Get out of here. Where do you think you're going? To my room. Why? - I just talked to the principal. Yes, I've been suspended. Yes, the school can't stand you, I can't stand you. What about your friends? Get out of my sight. I don't want to see you anymore. I'm leaving. Here are Lennart's tapes. Now you know what it's like when they destroy something you love. You think I don't know what that's like? You little prick. You think I don't know? Come here. Stand still, you bastard. I'll get you eventually. Come here. I assume that you'll settle the argument with Mr Van der Steen yourself? Yes, sir. Good, girl. Then I won't get involved anymore. Next stop: Amsterdam Central Station. Bastard. You're Roosmarijn, aren't you? I'm Astrid. I heard you're not going to join the organising committee? No. - Because of Bob van der Steen, right? I heard that you told your entire class. That's why I want to talk to you. It's not about Bob. They're just making it up. Are you sure? - Yes, there's no problem. Bob harassed me. That's why I quit. I thought you were a victim too and we could take action together. But I guess I was wrong. Sorry. Astrid. It was brave of that boy in your class. - What? Calling Bob a pervert in front of everybody. It's all over school. Who are you talking about? - The boy who got suspended. I think his name is Sven. Thanks a lot. Oh, great. Thanks a million. Are you here to see Sven again? - I'd like to talk to him. Is he in? - No. He has been suspended, hasn't he? - That loser doesn't stop fighting. Do you mind if I leave a note? - If he's coming back. He ran away. Well, this is his room. What's that on your back? - Pain is gain, blood is good. What's that? Pain is gain and blood is good? I really couldn't come to school. - Sven never cancels his appointments. We can't go to my place. I won't bother you again. If you don't want to go swimming, then let me know next time. Ran away? I thought he was grounded. Where is he? - I have no idea. His brother didn't tell me. - He could be anywhere. When he was absent he was at his granny's. His granny's? I knew you'd come back. I bought a knife today. It's over, dad. You tormented me all these years. But I'm not afraid of you anymore. I'm here to end the bullying. What bullying? I wondered: Why do you hate me so much? Am I the biggest bastard to walk the face of the planet? That can't be it. - It can't? I never hurt you in any way. - I never hurt you either. Are you going to deny it now? - I don't know what you're talking about. I think you're being abused. - Stay out of this. These drawings. They tell the whole story. - They're pure fantasy. Of a wannabe filmmaker. - I saw the bruises with my own eyes. Then it's my word against yours, young lady. Here. That's what you need. I thought you had smashed them. - I'm not as childish as you are. You had a brother who died. I got beaten a lot as a child. Even when I didn't deserve it. I was good for nothing. But Richard could do no wrong. He charmed everybody. Man, I hated him. He was good at everything. Except for one thing. There was one thing at which I was better. Swimming. It was a hot day. I remember that. I saw the cool water. I thought: I'll show my dad who's best. I challenged Richard. I said: I'll race you to the water. Richard won. Who says I didn't let him win on purpose? It was an accident, Wim. All I know is that if I hadn't challenged him... he wouldn't have jumped in the water. He'd still be alive now. And every time I see you looking at me with those eyes... I see him. And then you start beating me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry too, dad. How long have we been waiting? - He'll show up. Have some faith in mankind. Hi, guys. I'm sorry I'm late. That's okay. Are you ready? Well, I'd rather film. - You don't need to impress anybody? Who? - Roosmarijn. She's not here, is she? - Old people sex. I hope you learnt something. - I'm very good at falling flat on my face. Guys, come. Guys, let's go. Oh, cool. Hold on. Can you film us from above? Roosmarijn? - Bart told me you'd be here. Oh, Bart. Did you quit free running? - Yes, no more bruises for now. I want to thank you for standing up to Bob. I'm sorry you got suspended. I'm sorry you had to witness our family drama. There's no need to be ashamed. I don't have to hide it anymore now. How's your father doing? - He's finally got professional help. And you? - I'm going to make a film. A film? About how hard it is to get a girlfriend. You have a girlfriend, don't you? - What makes you say that? In Limburg. Your brother said... I don't have a girlfriend. Well in that case I wonder: Could I play the part of the girlfriend? - Sure. But first you need to pass a test. - What test? This one.
