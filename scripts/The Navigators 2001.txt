What's all this, then? That's you. We're railwaymen, us . That's what you're gonna be called from now on. - What, all of us ? - All of us, aye. When's that come in? Well, that's what we're gonna be called now. (Chatter) Morning, lads . Er, you'll be pleased to know you don't have to go out straightaway. - (Chatter continues ) - Oi! Oi! Excuse me, I've got something important to tell you here. There's a briefing I'm gonna tell you about. Because, er, it's about your new company. East Midlands lnfrastructure. All right? I've got a briefing about it here. So, if you just listen carefully,... er, don't interrupt. You know, just for once, try and... - Morning. - Oh, aye, where've you been? Toilet. Toilet, oh. You're not late, are you? - No. - No, been here ages . - Have you clocked on? - Yeah. All right. Well, sit down and listen. All right? (She murmurs ) Thought it were girls who were s'posed to go to toilet together. - He won't wake up in the morning. - I was knackered. Your settee's crap . - She'll not have him. Too much sense. - Thank you, Fiona. Right, now. Hang on, hang on. Listen, lads . Now then, if there's anyone here not actually based at this depot, because one or two of you lads are on loan from Woodburn depot, aren't you? So, hands up all those who are on loan from Woodburn. OK, I'm sorry, lads , but this information is not for you, OK? So I must ask you to go outside, all right? - What's he talking about? - (Laughter) What are you laughing at? What is it? Why? Why have they got to go outside? Why? Because they're a different company now and I don't want them s pying on us... - (Laughter) - ..and pinching our jobs . Who d'you think we are, James Bond? Oi. Oi! Oi! Oi! What the hell are you laughing at? Come on. Keep it down. - (Muttering) - Come on, lads . What, they've got to go? - Yeah. - (Chatter) This is... This is daft, this . - Listen, British Rail is gone now. - I'll tell you what he says, lads . - It's not... - It's daft, this . Listen, hang on. It's not like that any more, Gerry. British Rail's gone. Woodburn depot is now Northern lnfrastructure and they're gonna be competing with us . All right? Er,... A... And look, it's all in this briefing. - All right? Have they gone? Right. Fine. - They've left door open, they might hear us . Hey! Hey, hey, hey, come on. Listen, you're not rail workers any more. Er, you're now East Midlands lnfrastructure. For now, anyway. Er, you don't work for British Rail and we've got to win contracts from the, er, Railtrack company. Er, and we've got a managing director to... to win the work for us, all right? - Who's he, then? - Because now, in the future, just... - Who is he? - Just... All right, all right, listen. Just doing the job is not gonna be good enough in the future. Right? You've gotta do it well, if we're gonna succeed. And we've gotta advertise our skills and we've got to have a mission statement. - What's a mission statement? - Mission lmpossible. - (Some laughter) - Missionary position. - (Laughter) - All right, all right, keep the banter down, lads . Let's keep it serious. This is important stuff you've gotta... you've gotta listen to here. Look, a mission statement is where we say what we're gonna do... Er, and then we have to do it. (Laughter) - I'm off to work. - (Laughter) - All right. - I'm going for a shit. - (Laughter) - All right! Come on! Listen! I've got bloody more important things to do than bloody go on talking to you lads like this . - I'm going for a shit. - All right, now come on. That's the way things are gonna be done in future, right? Now listen. Because to succeed in the marketplace, we've gotta sell our wares p... carefully. - And we've gotta... - (Laughter) We've got to look after the customer if we're gonna keep 'em. All right? And we've got to have safety written into the contract. Er, because if we don't work safely, well, we don't work at all. All right? - We do work safely. - And, er... - Eh? - We always work safely. Well, you try, but it's not as safe as when I used to do the job, I'll tell you that. (Jeering and laughter) - Ta(!) That's right on... - You might bloody scoff, but it's bloody true. Some of the old lads, I wish they were still here. Show you bloody lads a thing or two, I'll tell you. Old Len knows what I'm talking about. He was one of the lads . Old Len ha'n't... 'Ere, Old Len ha'n't a bloody clue what you're talking about. (Laughter) Oh, now listen, hang on. Now this really is important. All right. We've had a bit of fun, lads , but now come on, get serious now. Look, deaths have got to be kept to an acceptable level. (Laughter) Oi! Hang on! Shut up. Shut up . - What's an acceptable level? - Er,... two a year. - But nobody's been killed for past 1 8 month. - (Laughter) - Any volunteers ? - (Laughter) - That's daft. - If you're third one, you're sacked. Look, I'm just bloody telling you what it says here, right? Listen. Now then, the final thing is... there's a letter here for each of you. I want you to read it carefully. - What's it for, that, then? - It's about redundancy. If... - You're going to make it compulsory. - No, it's not compulsory. - It... It's up to you whether you accept it. - Have you got one, an' all? Gonna buy us off, then. Gonna buy us off. - That's it. Sell us down the river again. - Aye. Are we all getting one of these? Should do, aye. There's one for each of you. (Muttering) Are you getting one? - Michael. - I don't need one, lad. - Why, has he got sack? - John. - Is this what they call fucking hand-outs ? - Eh? (Chatter) - Paul. - I ain't been here long enough to cop for that. Come on then, let's be having you! - Come on, lads . - We can't do owwt in this, Len. It's wet. - Easy on them brakes, mate. - It's raining on me, as well. Come on. Let's get for'ard and have a look at job. Come on! He's a bloody nutcase.

But, er, what's he doing here? - Working. - What d'you think I'm doing? Working? But he shouldn't, should he? Because he's not in our company now. Don't you remember? We are now East Midlands... er, lnfrastructure. He... He's Northern lnfrastructure. Completely different unit. He shouldn't... He's one of lads. Been wi' us four month. - Get your... Get your tackle. You've got to go. - He can't go. - What d'you mean, "He can't go"? - Why d'you think he can't go? - I've signed for this, so I take it. It's mine. - What... - Can't do job without meter. - The meter? - No, all right, no problem. I'll bring one back. - When? As soon as I take him back, I'll get another one. - At this time of day, with traffic? You're joking. - I can only do me best. If he goes... If he goes and takes meter, we might all as well go. - Well, I didn't know he'd got that. - Well, somebody let him have it. I didn't let him have it, did l? I didn't know he'd bloody got it. - Look, come on. Come on. I'm sorry. - I'm off. I'm off. See ya. Have you got anything else? ls that all you've got?

Might as well get off, then. - Well, I'm not doing that without a meter. - He's a prick, him, i'n't he? - All right, lads ? - You all right? - What's going on? - Leaving, mate. Taking the money. - What about working your notice? - Taking us holidays . If you ha'n't got no holidays , you can take unpaid leave. - Bloody hell, lads, that's a bit cquick. - What, and all your gang's took it, an' all? - Most of us, yeah. - Eh, Gerry, come and listen to this .

Hey, Gerry, what's this frigging notice they've put on t'clock? - What notice on clock? - They've put a chuffin' notice on t'clock. Harpic's just banged it up . - Harpic has ? - It's getting fucking ridiculous . - Oh, fuck. - What's it say? You've got a right number, ha'n't you, lads, eh? Money for nowwt. Bloody hell. That's our bloody part-time job gone down t'drain. - Can't believe he's done it again. - What about my allotment? I'm in a right state. - Look at this . - "All staff must clock off as well as on." Bastard Harpic. He can't do this . He should have consulted me first. - That's what I said. - I'll go and sort it out. - What's he done, Gerry? - That bastard, Harpic. - What? - Eh? Is that Harpic a bastard, or what? Are you gonna tell him, Gerry? Are you gonna sort it, cock? He won't get away with this one. You tell him. Oh, hello. Hello, Gerry lad. What can I do for you? - This notice that's on t'clock. - Yeah, well, what's wrong with it? You know full well you can't just bring in changes like that. You're sup posed to consult it in first. Look, Gerry, I mean, you're already here. We're just asking you to clock out so we know when you've finished. It's on the time sheets. It was agreed years ago we didn't need to clock off. - Look, Gerry, we don't want any fraud. - Are you accusing us of fraud? Er,... did you not consult this in, Mr Jackson? Er,... well, no. I didn't think it was necessary. - Gerry, can you just give us a minute, please? - Yeah, I'll wait outside. Thanks . - (Door closes ) - Bill, I'm only doing as I'm told. Well, yes, I know. Um, but it's... how we do it, isn't it? Hey, Gerry, what did he say? - It still stands, but I've got us a concession. - What? Don't have to clock up on Sunday now, we can go straight to job. But we don't clock on on Sundays . That's no bloody concession, is it? - We don't clock on on Sundays anyway. - Best I could get. - Bastard, he is . - Listen, lads, we can't refuse to stay to time. - Hey up, lads . - Chips up, lads . Forget about it for a minute whilst we have us dinner. - Maybe we should... - Gerry. Gerry, just have your dinner. (Chatter) 'Ey, another tin of sardines here. Bloody hell, you were right, Paul. - Another tin of sardines, mate. - Ah, you see, what did I say? He's a great lad, i'n't he, down at that chip py? A few bags of chips, free tin. - Free tin of sardines again, Jack. - I'll have them. I've nowwt for me fucking dinner. Tha's joking, mate. I've been for 'em, I keep 'em. - Like a bit of sardine, don't you, Jack? - You, you're a greedy bastard! (Whis pers) Oh, come on, Trace. (Whis pers) I don't want to. Paul might hear us . You shouldn't be thinking about Paul, you should be thinking about me. - I don't want to. - Yeah, but I do! (He sighs ) He can't hear us . You said... that you could hear him moving about. So he must be able to hear us He's probably asleep by now. (Faint giggling) (Moans ) - (Crash) - What was that? (Sighs ) Come on, let's get on t'floor. It'll be cquieter on t'floor. Look, I just... I don't... I don't want to. Yeah, but I want to! (Sighs) Let's just... Let's just try and go to sleep, eh? Go to sleep?! How can I get to sleep ? Fucking hell! And then, if the... if the... er, if the other men work the overtime in the week, and then we change it around the week after. So if we go on a rota basis... Well, obviously we'll have to check these figures , Bill, but it looks OK at the moment. Um, just on more general note, how are things going here? I mean, is everything on schedule? I... yeah. I thi... Yeah, I think so. D'you, er,... D'you think the men are on board? Er,... well, yeah. I mean obviously they're... they're a little concerned about the way things are going and... - Have we met all the troublemakers yet? - What troublemakers ? The union men. You know what I mean. Er, well, we... we've got the, er, the union reps, of course, but... Usually they follow the agreements and... I don't normally have any trouble with them. Can I stop you there, Bill? There are no agreements . The slate's been wiped clean. Er, but we've got local and national agreements that... that go back a... a long way. - They go back a lot of years and... - Look, I just said there are no agreements . It is a clean sheet. OK? D'you understand that? (Chuckles) But these... But these agreements go back... - Bill... - ..go back a long... a long way. Bill, we're wasting time. Anyone who stands in the way of change is out. OK? They're out. They can either go voluntarily or they can just go. (Other man) We... We will give them the choice. Choice? What choice? We've got agreements that go back a long way. We... We... These... We've got agreements for... for promotion and redundancy. - We have conditions... - OK. - Fine. - I mean, it's... I understand what you're saying. No, I understand what you're saying. Right. I've signed it already. If you'd just like to write your letter of resignation above that, and I'll accept it this afternoon. Well,... I... - This is... - OK. You don't want to do that. - Of course not. - All right. Do this . That lot you've got down the yard. What are they? Signals and telecoms or something, isn't it? - Signals, yeah. - You brought in clocking off. Is that right? - With a bit of a concession. - I did, yeah. OK, well tell them the concession's been withdrawn. - I've only just negotiated it. - Bill, it's a win-win situation. You get to keep your job. I get to know you're on board. But I need to hear you've done it. Or that letter gets filled out. All right, come on, get cracking. Right. Oh, hello, Jack. Hello. Right, lads. You're all here, are you? Right. I've got something pretty important to tell you all and,... er,... I'm not sure whether you're gonna like it or not, but it's about the clocking procedure. The Sunday. I'm afraid... that concession's been withdrawn. - Oh, 'ey. - I'm afraid so. Yes, look, I'm sorry. (Angry muttering) - I'm sorry, you've just got to accept it. - No, you agreed. But an agreement, well, it could be just a... a... a... an understanding - which might have been misunderstood. - You're talking bollocks . - Oi! - Just refresh your memory for you, shall l? - I'll just refresh your memory. - Oh, here we go. - Gerry and his famous bits of paper. - Except on Sundays. Right? You agreed. Right? It's in the minutes . - And what's more... is that your signature? - Yes . - Is that your signature? - It is. I'd recognise it, yeah. That means you signed it. You have signed this agreement. OK. I may have done. But what I'm saying now... What d'you mean, you may have done, you blind git? Look, that's your signature! Can you just watch your language, please? - Well... - I'm saying that that was my signature then - Time... - Have you swap ped it now? All right, it's still my signature on an agreement. - He's swap ped his signature now. - (Sniggering) - What I'm saying is... - You didn't mean it, is that what you're saying? There's something different now. And it's just one of those things you have to accept. No, we don't have to... We don't need to accept it because you've already agreed. All right, Gerry, you don't need to accept it then. Just go and get your bloody cards . - (Worker) They're gonna sack you now, eh? - What about, er... If you don't wanna accept it, you know what to do. - Hang on, hang on. Health and Safety. - What d' you mean, Health and Safety? - Health and Safety. - Yeah, well, what about Health and Safety? That clock shouldn't be in here. This is our mess room. Gerry... But that clock is not a Health and Safety issue! Look, we're entitled, right, to a place away from the workplace, right? Right. Yes . - Yes, I agree. Yes . - So that clock shouldn't be in here. But it's not gonna poison you, for Christ's sake! It's not a Health and Safety hazard, is it? Look, we have to have somewhere to eat, right? Away from the workplace. - Yeah, well, this is it, innit? - What if I ring the Railway Safety lns pectorate? - Oh, come on, that's ridiculous ! - No, it's not. You're gonna bring the whole bloody tribe down on us, are you? Might well do. Unless that clock's shifted. - That's what I'll do. - Oh, this is getting ridiculous . - I don't care what you say. - I think I've heard enough now. It's no more ridiculous than you signing that and telling us it's no good. I can always rely on you, can't l? You are... You... I don't believe it. This is beyond reason. This is absolutely unreasonable. Unreasonable. - Un-bloody... - Get up there. Tell them to come and shift it. Un-bloody reasonable! Read my fucking lips ! (Jeering) Oh, Mr Jackson!

Er, with a small workforce we can't attract the work and... I'm, sorry, but you're all on 1 2 weeks' notice. Thanks(!) So, er, redundancy's, er,... voluntary so long as we volunteer? It's not my decision, Gerry. I mean, I'm just the messenger. This affects me, as well. I don't know what I m gonna do. Mind you, there are some Railtrack jobs down at Nottingham, Derby. Nottingham! But, like, you've got to use your own vehicles to get there, and in your own time. - You can't just finish us . - Mick, there's no choice. We're not viable. Viable! We're not viable? But we wanna work! I'm not gonna be efficient on t'dole, am l? But, Mick, that's not how it works, is it? I mean, you've been to the same briefings as I have. And what they've said... If we're not viable, we're not efficient. And if we're not efficient, we don't attract work. And at the end of the day there's no jobs for anyone. So what you're saying, we accept being out of work, otherwise we're out of chuffing work? - Gerry, are... - Is that what you're saying? Are you deliberately misunderstanding me? What I'm saying is, there's no work and you can't get paid for doing nowwt. What about this ecquipment we're smashing up ? Yeah, well, that's OK. But I mean after that... This is it, it's finished. There's nothing after that. - So do we still have to come in every day, like? - Yes, course you do, Jim. I mean, they're not gonna pay you for sitting at home, are they? - Well, what about clocking? - Yes, you're gonna have to clock on and off because, you know, they expect you to put a full day's work in for a full day's pay. Don't be bloody stupid! We haven't got a full day's bloody work. Gerry, it's company policy. We're trying to raise productivity! Productivity! Produc... Sat in here for 1 2 weeks on our arse, doing nowwt, only chuffing clocking on and clocking off! Productivity, my arse, Tom! Gerry, it's about being efficient! Efficient? Fucking efficient! You and your fucking clock! I'll fucking shove it up your fucking arse, mate, you fucking knobhead! - Hey! - D'you know why he's fucking management?

Well, I don't mind doing that but I'd rather, you know, I'd rather do... Yeah, well, we'll make that as priority. You know, I'll just put that on your form. What else d'you get, apart from that? - I don't understand. What... What d'you mean? - Well, what else d'you get apart from your pay? You know, like, er, holiday money, travelling expenses, allowance for work gear. Er, well you get a contract setting out your pay. And the hours of work, you know, when we've got the work for you. - Yeah. - Er, but that's it. No holidays . - No? - And you have to provide your own work gear. What about sick pay? No. Then again, if you can't work, then we don't pay you. It's as simple as that. It's like if you want to go on holiday. You're not available for work. - So you don't get paid for that, either. - Aye. Er, d'you have a Personal Track Safety card? - Yeah. - And a Lookout card. I need to look at those. So have you got a lot on, then? ls there a lot on right now? No problem. Yeah. Thank you.

B... Bye. (Whis pers) Fucking hell! (Sighs) Bollocks ! (Tracy) I'm here. Hiya. (Hums ) - (Baby cries ) - Shh. (Whis pers) It's all right. Shh. It's all right. Shh, shh, shh, shh, that's it. Shh, you have a sleep . What are you doing? When I asked you to clean it, I meant give it a wipe round. Oh, aye, it were filthy, Trace. (Sighs) Look, can you just... budge out the way for a bit while I sort this shop ping out? - But I ain't finished. - Just go in there for a bit, all right? Look, Mick, we're gonna have to sort something out. I've got to go and pick Jamie up from school in half an hour and then I'll have to get his tea. - So what d'you want me to do, then, Trace? - You're gonna have to put it back together. - Well, I would if you'd give me a chance! - Well, all right, then. You go sort that out and then... I think when you've done that you should go down to agency and just show your face. They know me face down that agency, Trace, and they don't like it. Oh, Mick, I asked you to bring the... stupid washing in! - (Sighs ) - Well, I got involved wi' cooker, didn't l? I were only gonna gi' it a wipe and it were that filthy! Oh, all right! Have you never cleaned it? When's the last time you cleaned it? Look... Please, try and sort something out for yourself, will ya? I can't do with this, it's driving me mental. OK? We're gonna have to do summat, though, aren't we? Eh? You're gonna have to get something I don't know what. Go back to doing summat you were doing before. (Scoffs) Trace, I don't know if you've noticed, like, but steelworks are nearly shut. Or they're mechanised. All right? Look, I've been phoning up every morning and I just don't get it. I know there's loads of work cos all t'lads I used to work wi', they seem to be getting plenty. Well, the problem is, Mr Williams, you've been getting a lot of bad reports from site. - Have l? - You have. - About me? - Yes . I might have been involved in a couple of misunderstandings . Well, on more than one occasion, the contractors have rung in and s pecifically said not to send you to site any more. - Have they? - They have. That's why you've not been getting the work. Well, I think... I think that's because I've misunderstood how things are now. Well, we can't afford to get a bad reputation as an agency. I know that. But look, I haven't worked for weeks and I need to work. I'm... I'm gonna learn... to fit in. Look, just gi' us another chance. (Whis pers) Oh, shit! - (Door opens) Hiya, Gerry. - Hi, Fi. - Message from Mr Jackson. - Harpic? What does he want? A job up at Holmes, clearing out troughing. Bit of a rush. - Troughing job? - Mm-hm. There's a lot of work in them. I'll have to think about that one. Well, ap parently, contractors haven't turned up . They've got four men coming from agency tomorrow but you'll have to meet 'em there. - Oh, I might ring in sick. - Didn't hear that one! - So you'll be there tomorrow, then? - Might be. Right. Oh, have you, er, seen or heard from Paul since he left? No, I haven't. No. Nothing. Don't even know where he's living. All I know he's moved out of Mick's, though. - Just wondered, that's all. - Oh, right. - Er, who's winning? - Checkmate. - Checkmate? What's that mean? - Whatever move you make, you lose. Story of my life. Fucking 'ell! It's Mungo Jerry! - Gerry! - Bloody hell! - What are you doing here, you mup pet? - You re not agency workers . - Who are we? - You're you. - Bloody hell! Who's... Who's put you together? - It's is our new gaffer, innit? - Gets us all t'best jobs . - (Chuckles) What a team to... - I'd sooner have Three Stooges as you lot! - Get out of it! Chuff it. Anyway, what's job? Right. What's hap pened, one of t'banks has slip ped, right, so it's knackered all troughs . Some are broken, some are filled up . So what we need to do is get cables out, right? Once you've got cables out, any we can reuse, drag 'em clear. Dig a new bed. All right, lads, mind your backs. One on. Oh, one on, Paul. All right. Mind your backs, lads. One on. Clear the cess there. Lads, hey, listen. Gotta tell you this . - (Train horn) - Listen to this . (Chatter) (Gerry) ..and he come out of the office with his face like a tomato! Toilet! Toilet! Lads ! - Oh, fuck! - Fucking 'ell! Fucking 'ell! - Fucking 'ell, Jim! - Yeah, fucking 'ell, Jim! - Sorry, lads, I shouted "toilet"! - You blinkin' long streak of piss ! - I'm full of shite. - I shouted "toilet"! If you weren't gabbin' so bloody much, you'd've heard me! - We were only ten yard away from you! - You're covered in it, Gerry! - Chuffin' 'ell! - He's covered in it! - There's shit and everything in this lot! - (Laughs) You stink! - Look! - You stink! Gerry, don't go sticking your head out of window, they'll think we're in a bloody horsebox. Shut your face! - (Coughing) - What a stink that was ! (Gobs) D'you think they're gonna let us in? - Hey, where d'you think you're going? - For a pint. - Forget it, mate. He thinks he's coming in! - Oh, don't be daft! You're in... You're in charge of a motor vehicle, mate. - Oh, sod off! You can't pull that one on me. - Get in the van. Oh, you lousy bastards! Come on! I'm not drinking alcohol. - Hey! - Get in the van! (Murmur of voices ) - Thanks for that, Karen, love. - You're welcome. - Towels are in a bit of mess, like. - It don't matter. No problem. Thank you. I dunno. - Who got these? - Now then, lads... - Did you clean it off? - Come on, then. How's work going, then? - Eh? - How's work going? - Not too bad. - Had about... two week off since I finished. Yeah, we're doing all right, mate. Better than I thought we would, I'll tell you that. So... if I want more work, I'll have to pack in work? Well, I sup pose... You should've come with us when we came out. Ah, but what about gaffers ? Are you keeping them in check? Well, it's not the same, is it, Gerry? You know, it's a different situation, all that. What about tha, Mick? Have you had to assault any of them lately? Well, tha knows what it's like, Gerry. We used to get away with murder, but... It's like Paul's saying, things have changed. Things have changed. But I'll tell you one thing, there's plenty of money to be earned out there if you're willing to put yoursen for'ard. I know there's no sick pay nor nowwt like that, but you know what lads used to be like, taking t'mickey. Odd coupla days, odd coupla days . It worked out about two weeks a year, they used to swing lead. - No, I don't agree with you. - Oh, it's right, Gerry. Same blokes who wanted set hours at depot. Them same blokes were same blokes insisting on their rights were same blokes that didn't want to do job in first place. But I'll tell you what, now, you be flexible like these lads , put yoursen out a little bit, and there's top dollar. - What time d'you call this ? - Got a bit held up, didn't l? (Chuckles) I'll bet. - What's job, then? - Huh? - What's job? - Oh, concreting a signal base. - Ohh... - Aye, I know. Boring graft. All right, Jim? I've also been told, while you're all here together, that... if this job is successful and you do a good job of it, there's a lot more work coming off along this line. So obviously it's to your benefit, and mine as well, that we do a good job. - We'll get a load more work. - So how are we gonna get mixer down there? Well, you can t get mixer down there. You're gonna have to... mix your concrete here, into buckets, and then rope it over the top of the bridge, down to the track. - Well, that's gonna take some time, innit? - There's no other way of doing it. We looked at actually putting a trolley on the track and it was gonna work out so expensive that we couldn't go that way. We wanted to be the cheapest bid to get the work. That's why we're doing it this way. - But there's not enough of us to do it that way. - Of course there is . - There i'n't. - There's gonna be one doing the mixing. There's gonna be one passing the bucket on the rope down to the bottom of the track. You'll have a guy then take it from there to the shuttering and you can have a guy putting it in the shuttering and laying the concrete. That's four. There's four of you. (Cement mixer rumbles ) Jimmy! All right, lift. - All right, there? - You all right, mate? - There you go. - Where d'you want it? - Right. - You're doing a fine job. John! John! - Bloody train's just gone past! - You're joking! Good job I didn't have bucket over the edge. I never heard it. - Fucking keep your ears open. - Uh? - Keep your ears open! - I know. - (Shouting) - What? - (Shouts ) - John! Knock it off. Paul's shouting summat. - He's been hit! - What? Mick! It's Jim! He's been hit! You're fucking joking! Shit! Shit! Bollocks ! Shit! - Shit, what's hap pened? - I don't know, I think he must have been hit. - Just hang on, I'll get a torch. - Are you all right, Jim? - Is he all right? - Oh, fucking 'ell! Come on, Paul! Shit! - Paul, what hap pened, man? - I don't know. How the bleeding hell's this hap pened? Oh, shit! He must have been hit by summat hanging from t'train. Oh, shit! Christ almighty, I'll get an ambulance. - John, John, hang on a minute! - What d'you mean, "Hang on"? - Just think about it! - Think about what? He's injured, man! - They can't find him here, can they? - What d'you mean, "They can't find him here"? If they find him here we're fucked, aren't we? Think about it. If they find him here, they'll know we've not been working safely. He's more important than that, than fucking working safe! - Yeah, but we'll be fucked! - What are you talking about? If they find him here, they'll know we've not been working safely. We've had it! Who d'you think's gonna cop for this ? Not that subcontractor, Kevin Brown. - We re gonna cop for it, mate. - He's worth more than that, mate! - D'you wanna lose your job? - Fucking hell! We'll get the signal post! - Where? Which way? Which way? - Oh fuck! I don't know! - Mick, he could be dying! - I know he could, mate. - So get an ambulance! Mick! - John, just listen! If there's an incquiry, if that control box signal bloke gets involved tonight,... we've had it! I don't know what you're talking about! John, just go and get an ambulance! The man's gone fucking mad! - Yeah, but if we get him back up there... - If there's an incquiry, we've all had it. He's right, mate. And if we get him back up there, mate, he'll get taken care of cquicker. - We'll get him up here cquicker, mate! - You might hurt him! But we can't get an ambulance crew down here till we've got possession! We don't even know where signal post is ! - He's right, Paul. - Nobody's checked it. - You get an ambulance, we'll carry him. - We'll get him up there cquicker, mate. - Go on, Paul. - No, no, I'll do it, I'll do it! - You go! Go on! - Are you sure, mate? - Don't fucking let us down. - Please! Just go! Come on, get the shoulders . Get the shoulders, Paul. Mick, I can't do it, man! - Paul! - I can't do it! I can't do it, Mick. - Paul, come on, man! - I can't move an injured man. - Look, I know we shouldn't... - We shouldn't move an injured man, Mick. There's a lot of things we shouldn't do! I shouldn't be hanging a bucket off that bridge! We shouldn't be working wi'out a lookout. But we have! - How are we gonna explain that? - Mick, you might kill him! - He might die if he fucking stays here! - But you can't go moving him, can ya? Fucking... Hey! Look... ! - You don't know what damage has been done! - Paul! Paul! Just help me get him up there! - But you might kill him! - He might die if he stays here! - We'll get an ambulance in two minutes ! - But at least an ambulance'll see to it properly! Hey, we're gonna lose us jobs . Paul, you got me this job, didn't ya? I've only been on it three years . I've just been six weeks without earning a penny, mate. I don't know what to... I don't know... I can't move him, can l? Paul, listen, if we get him up on there, we'll say car hit him. What the fuck does it matter if a train hits him or a car hits him? - It don't matter! - You can't go fucking saying a car's hit him! - Why not? - Because you haven't got a story. So what we gonna do, then? Are we gonna get signalman involved? Incquiry? Paul, we ain't even got a lookout patch wi' us tonight. I don't know if there's one in van, even. An ambulance crew's gonna be ages before we get possession. But you're gonna hurt him if you move him. - He's already hurt, mate. - You might even kill him. - Yeah, we might kill him if we leave him. - Think about it. We might kill him if we leave him. - Oh, Mick... We shouldn't be doing this . - I know we shouldn't. I know we shouldn't. We shouldn't be doing this . - Come on, let's get him up. Yeah? - All right. Come on. Come on, Jimmy. All right, Jim. - (Jim groans ) - Steady with him, Mick. Come on, Jim, we'll have you up in two minutes . Steady. Steady. Yeah, I'm under his legs .
