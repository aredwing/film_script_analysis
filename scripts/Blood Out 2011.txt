Look, uh... ..I just need to get your signature here on this positive ID form and we can get back to work. You know, I'd greatly appreciate it. - Feathers, huh? - Yeah, something like that.

Then I busted her for attempting to bribe an officer. - That's ballsy. - What? She swallowed the evidence. (LAUGHS) - (ALL LAUGH) - Hey, guys, who's Hardwick? Right there. I'm Hardwick. Why you so uptight? Deputy Savion. I've been calling you. Hammond Sheriff's Department. Oh, yeah. Savion, right. Sorry I didn't get back to you. I've been real busy. Yeah, I see that. You wanted to know about that banger that got whacked a week ago, right? You mean my brother, right? My brother who was murdered? Any leads? Anyone in custody? Best we could figure was a member of a rival gang. Right. It's taken you, what, a week to work that out? The case has been filed 'Unsolved', OK? What are you talking about? You closed this? He was shot in the fucking back by a.50-cal handgun. There's, what, like, four in the fucking state? How hard is that to trace, guys? Look, sorry to hear about your brother, alright? - Really? - Really. But you probably know better than I do what he was up to. A lifetime banger, slinging drugs on the streets for years. Yeah, I knew what he was doing. My brother, though, you know? Yeah, well, we look at it like a problem solved, alright? Another low-life thug off the streets. Now, I don't know how you boys handle things down in Mayberry, but here we don't lose sleep when the bad guys do the dirty work for us. All of you, you're a fucking disgrace. - Disgrace? - Fuck! Oh!

Fuck you very much, Officer Sayvion...Savion, whatever the fuck your name is. - What about work? - You kidding me? Still think I got a job after what went down in there? That's not true, man. They'll probably just put you on a desk till they get this sorted. You're probably right. Can you imagine me behind a desk? - No. - Yeah, me neither. I'll call you, man. Hey, Mike, I did some more snooping around. - What you get? - Something's really weird. It smells like somebody high up is taking control on a local or even state level. - Are you kidding me? - No. That's bullshit. This prick in here's got my gun and my badge. Can you go get it? - I got you, brother. - Alright. I'll call you, man. OK. (TENSE MUSIC) (SIREN BLEEPS) This is unit 17. I have a possible 4-2 in progress.

I thought you would know Zed. Yeah, I know exactly who he is. I just didn't know he was down here taking care of a snitch. Anyway... ..Elias wants to meet you. So let's go see him. SONG:This is a movement A real movement Like coke in motion You motherfuckers talk like you a movement But none of youse are moving I walked the hills. I had to climb with these legs of my own My hard days and dark nights put my head in the zone Hustled for blood money Left my wife pregnant at home We're on the television Everyone's regularly stoned I flashback to a '70s song in the Volare with my mom Picture the future Seeing everything gone My wife is asking me.

Yeah, well, Elias says we gotta bounce. Wants to get his new general to the game. (STARTS CAR) Michael, Anthony here tells me of all your good deeds. Everyone...bear witness. You, Michael, are now my general. What the fuck is a general? He's been locked up a for a while. Michael, the world sees us as nothing but thugs... ..street rats, urchins... ..as Lucifer does. We have the world fooled. Cops are numb, and our business has expanded. Sounds like a good thing. Like the cogs on a wheel, we build our machine piece by piece. It's not a problem. We just, uh... we go recruit more bangers, right? We get the baddest mother-fuckers in the world. It's not like the marines. It's like the Mayans. We conquer a tribe, they bang for us. They're not us. Doesn't matter. They're warriors. How do you think a 13th Street boy became an Assassin? And if they won't roll, Elias jets them to another set. Fair enough. They're soldiers. They know nothing but thugging, fighting and fucking. It takes a man like you... ..to become a general. We get paid handsomely... ..the world needs us... ..and we need the paper. I'll be watching you tonight. Just to see how good you really are. - Kelvin Martin. - Yeah, I know who he is. I knew him. You guys are tied in with the cops? Wouldn't exactly call Hardwick a cop. We want Martin. Anything else, my friend... ..is a bonus. Let's go catch us a tribe. I'm in. (TURNS ENGINE OFF) Look, first thing we gotta do, make sure they don't have eyes. You two, go check the corners. Get back quick. We get in there, we move fast. Don't give 'em any chances, OK? You got it? Let's do it. - What's up, mother-fucker?! - Yeah, don't fucking move! Yeah, sit your fucking ass right there! I wish you would, huh? Yeah. - Get your hands where I can see them! - RUN! Arggh! Don't even fucking think about it. Keep those fucking hands where I can see them. Stay there. Anthony, we got a rabbit. (BOTH GRUNT WITH EXERTION) No! Come back here! (COCKS PISTOL) (MEN PUNCH AND GRUNT) Fuck you up, man! Hey, Squat. I got it. You Kelvin? You wanna come check my ID, huh? Come check my ID. It's in my back pocket. ('U AIN'T HARD' BY D MAC) Ugh! Ugh! Oh! Hey, Kelvin, just so you know, from now on, you belong to the Assassins, OK? (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) You made it. What, you had doubts? Hmm, maybe. I'm warrior blood. You risk death. Shit, then I guess I'm dead, huh? (LAUGHS) I'm only slightly dramatic. No, you're not. But you are elusive. Yes, I am. I am elusive because I do not put expectations on other people. That way I do not get let down. (LAUGHS) You learn a few things when you've been screwed over as much as I have. Things change, right? From now on, I'm around. Oh, really? And who are you? And, more importantly, why are you here? Why? You waltz in here like you're king of the fucking world. I mean, Elias is trying to figure out a way to adopt you. - And on top of that, you... - Hey, hey, hang on. Maybe, uh... Maybe it's not that complicated. Maybe, you know, you and l... ..you and I are just here because we're here. What do you think? (MOANS SOFTLY) ('OCEANS' BY ANDRA) Oh! Oh. (TENSE MUSIC) Hey, Billy. Mike. Man, how are you? - Where are you? - You don't wanna know. What d'you find? Well, when I searched the national database for RSA and I cross-referenced Elias, it's pretty obvious the Feds are all over this gang. It's on the FBI's national task force list as well. Mike? Mike, are you there? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Fucking Feds. Damn. I guess, you know, sometimes, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, right? Look, man, this shit is bigger than you. I know what you're trying to do and I really understand it. But if I were you, I'd just let it go. I mean, look at David. You knew the life he lived. And if you're thinking about doing some vigilante-type shit, you might not get away with it. Don't have a choice, Billy. I gotta take care of this. Michael, make no mistake about it. With a badge, it's justice served. Without a badge, it's murder. It's like this, man. Why don't you just tell me where you are, so if you need any help, I can be johnny-on-the-spot? Thanks for caring, man. Gotta keep you clean. You're in deep enough. Take care, Billy. Shit. Fucking Feds. I can't believe it. Hey, Gloria, wait. For God's sake, listen to me, I need to help you! I wanna help you. You one of Anthony's homies? - What you got? Some blow for me? - No. Nothing like that. My name's Michael. Michael, David's brother. David who? David Savion. What the fuck?! Why am I supposed to fucking believe you? Come in here with these crank-ass whores! Listen to me. I'm trying to get you out of here. This is why I'm here. Gotta get you out of here, you have a baby. Your baby, David's baby, OK? Let me help you. How am I supposed to believe you? - That's fucking shit! - Listen...listen to me. Come here. Can't fucking tell the whole neighbourhood. Come here, please. It's our mother's ring you're wearing. How am I supposed to believe you? Listen to me, I just wanna get you out of here. Take care of yourself, take care of the baby, take care... - Just let me help you, please. - No, no. You guys murdered the only fucking thing I ever loved. - I loved him. - How am I supposed to... I loved him, too, Gloria. Fuck you! Get that fucking shit away from me. Fuck. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Hey, man. Gonna shoot me through the door? What, with this? What's up? Elias wants to see you. Yeah, what about? He wouldn't say. And I asked. - What, right now? - Right fucking now. OK. Give me a second. (TENSE MUSIC) ELIAS: Michael. MICHAEL: What's going on? - Sit down. Come on. - OK. I need to talk to you. Sit, please. Do you remember I spoke to you about the war? - Yeah. Every...every word. - Good. The world you and I travel in is run by very few powerful men. Now, these men are not politicians. Nor are they military experts. The battles we've fought over petty turf is now behind us. We've grown to become leaders. International leaders. We no longer divide and conquer. We conquer and divide. This weekend is a summit of our network. I know that. Arturo is representing South America... ..Zed and I North America. Who's covering Europe? - I like your thinking. - Business, right? Right. But first things first. We can unite North and South America. That puts Zed at the top and me over North America. Sounds like a bloodbath to me. Yes and no. Then again, perhaps it's down to you. Me? Why? We decided to keep it fun... entertaining...civilised. Arturo brings his general, and I bring mine. You. How can I help? A blood match. Winner takes all. Now... ..the question is, Mr General... ..are you willing to represent our organisation? What do you think? You lose... ..we work for Arturo till the end of our days. You win... Look at me. ..riches...beyond your wildest imagination... ..will be ours. Who would I be fighting? Hector Gonzales. Arturo's greatest general. Really? So how great is he? You're greater. You're faster. You're more powerful, more intelligent. You can win. No, no, no, no. Not you can win. You will win. So I guess, um...your wish... ..my honour, right? I thought you'd say that. OK, let's celebrate. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) Yep? Yo, it's A-Train. Gloria's here. - Really? - She told me about yesterday. - And? - She wants your help. Cool. That's a good thing, right? Where are you? Fifth and Broussard. OK. OK, I'll be right there. (HANGS UP) (TENSE MUSIC) We cool? We're cool. You're doing the right thing, you know that. I know. Thank you. Course. She wants help? I hope so. Why don't you go ask her? Hey, Gloria, you OK? I just wanna get out. That's why I'm here. Anything you need, we can arrange that, right? We'll help you. Alright. Let me ask you a question. Truthfully. Where do you really stand with Elias? Elias has a saying. "We cut off the heads of those that will not bow." Yeah, sounds like him. - How's that working out? - It's not. Elias said... .."They've lost their way... "..and no man is bigger than the set." Time for a change, huh? (KNOCK AT DOOR) Just you? Come in. I know you're a cop. (LAUGHS) What the fuck are you talking about? I saw the way you cleared the lndigo's house. If you weren't there, it would've been bang, bang, and whoever's left standing would've won. Yeah, well, I'm still not a cop. And I've had similar tactical training at Quantico. I ran your DNA, Deputy Michael Savion. What the fuck? You're a fucking Fed? Yes, I'm a fucking Fed. I'm deep undercover. Look, we've been in the field on this for a very long time. I built a DNA database of the gang members which we're gonna use to convict them. We've been hoping to get these guys all together in one place at the same time. The summit is what we've been waiting for. You cannot -- cannot -- screw this up, Michael. - It's important to me, too. - What do you mean? This guy Zed, what do you know about him? Zed -- he's one of our main targets. British sonofabitch. Their "guv'nor". Why? He killed my brother. Yeah, he wanted to go straight, have a family, and they shot him in the back for that. Wait, so this is not an operation? This is just you? Yeah. Jesus Christ, Michael! You can't just come in like a vigilante. We're gonna take Zed down. This is bigger than you and your brother and Elias. You can't do something to screw this up. (MURMURING) (TENSE MUSIC) What have you given up, Zed... ..in your...haste for the world? Given up? We gain the world. Oh, it's a little scratch of earth... ..maybe... ..only until it's swallowed up by the beast... ..with your remnants and skeletons of bones remaining. Mother Earth's breath is weighted. So, what do you know about this guy? Hector Gonzales? Well, he's never lost. The guy's a beast. Even for you. We got shit to do, right? I'm not done yet. I need a minute alone. Win tonight. Don't do anything stupid. Wait for my signal. This is bigger than you and your brother. I know. Guess it's worth winning, though. Huh? ANTHONY: Hey, guys? They're here. You see, I heard the whispers. - Whispers? - Yes. Yes, the voices that tell me you seek... ..perhaps... ..Michael's scratch of earth for your own, hm? Perhaps. Perhaps. Whispers, my friend, they told me you were looking for los campeones. That is why I have come here. What the fuck is this? That's for me? You fucking kidding me? Come on, I'm old-school, remember? I guess you should... You know where you found it? Just take it back. What exactly do you want, Arturo? We both want the same thing. Control. A little scratch of earth. At all costs. This is my sacrifice. I know you're taking the best soldiers from all sets. You've never lost a summit. That's true. And neither have you. That's it, Michael. You stay focused. I need to go find my sister. She's missing. Now, look, brother, at some point, man, if things go well, I'm gonna go ghost. You're doing the right thing, man. Look at them. I want what you want -- spreading our reach throughout the world. But unlike you... ..I don't forget who my family really is. (MURMURING) (WOLF WHISTLING AND CHEERING) (CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUDS) (WHISTLES) (THUMPS FLOOR) Hail Mars, son of Juno, god of war! On toward to battle! Hail Mars... ..son of Juno, god of war!

Do you truly think you possess the virtue to rule all of the Americas? Do you?! Don't you worry about me. Oh, not even for a second. But perhaps it is you that should worry about yourself. The position you seek is a precarious one. ELIAS: No, Arturo, I think it's you... ..that's in a fucking precarious position. Enjoy the elation of your conquest. Albeit brief. (CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING) Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Let's go. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael!
