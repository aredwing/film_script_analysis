You have to ask him. Here man must stay a lot too much, you know? Harvey shows he excessively rest this morning. Yeah. I seriously doubt he's feeling any pain. I don't know about you but I have been forced to get mad out of here. I thought you like being in western states. I did. But too much time close can drive a person crazy. Do you know what I'm saying? I'm taking my recent travel to see what I end up. Even able to save that kind of money working this job? Well, I put a little bit away. I don't exactly live an extravagant life style around here. So you don't know what you're going to do, then? Haven't given me much thought, I guess. I don't know what to move on to the next job with Jack. Well, maybe you figure more things out. Maybe. Jesus Christ! The phone was bad for the last half hour. Something I can help you with? Yeah, I need my game and my license renewed. I thought I go check the barn around here. How is it good the time here? Time to travel a lot, huh? Now I make I can't help you there. We closed our shop yesterday. About 4 hours from now we're gonna be heading out of here with the last school buses. Wait a minute. I'll play and pack it in? Close to us, I guess. The stuff I handle are local. Advanced construction on the dam here a couple of weeks ago. Now my pledge to stick around for anymore. Hey, you can go back to Pineview to get license renewed. You want me to backpack some like 50 miles... for allowing a piece paper? How long you sure your plan on us sticking around for? Couple days. - You'll travel by yourself? - Yeah. I don't like the hell! Sounds like I will be around to to check it anyway. Thanks. Type in the bad shot, you know. Everytime I a kind of come back empty handed. Who wants to throw the tape? Yeah, well, maybe you get a better luck this time. How do you want? Well, I'm sure I have to tell you I will be around to collect. What the hell do happen now? Oh, Jeez. He had a knife. - Where is it? - He had it when he came in. On the floor! I said on the floor, now! What is the matter? You take one more step and I'll hit the trigger shoot you right here. Jesus Christ. I just said, fuck, back the hell off. Stuart. Stuart. Oh, Jesus! I just said, fuck it, back the hell off. Stuart, you got to take a look at this. Please, don't. I'll will do whatever you want me to do. Please don't. Aah-a-a-ah! Amy, I'll be right there. Lord Jesus! Please, Jack. I'm right here. No. No. - I can't even feel my arm. - You're okay. - I am cold. - Okay. - I'll be back. - You're not going to leave me, are you? As long as you're out of my sight, it will be okay. - Please, Jack. - You're safe, I promise. No! - Whoa, whoa. Easy, Jack. - For Christ sake, Stuart. - You didn't answer your phone. - It's in a box somewhere. Why a kind you keep me for a long time? We need you out of the station, Jack. I am done with out place. Whatever that you handle it. I don't think so. You get to want to see it for yourself. Is it true, Sheriff? You're leaving, too? I want to stop by this afternoon and tell you myself. It's been almost a year since you turned your back on my daughter, now you're doing it again. I'm not turning my back around. There is nothing more I can do. They never found any body. She could still be out there. You should still be looking. Look, the sheriff from Pineview is having Amy's file now. He promised to contact me if there anything new. My daughter's gone because of you. That's something that never has changed. Is it okay? You find the knife? No, I love it's not here. The handle of the knife, what color is it? What color was it? He was standing in the middle of the room covered in blood eyes. I can't tell I paid much attention to the knife. Did you see the color there or not? Red, I think. It was hard to tell, what does it matter? Hey, Sheriff. Hey, Harvey, find the knife. Are you hungry? Need something to drink? Get someone you want us to call? Parents, friend? My deputy checked you over. So we know it was not your blood. That leaves us two possibilities. One, it's animal blood and it's some kind of prank. Exam time out to indicate, I think, they want kids to be home in time for dinner. Possibility number two: It's human blood. If that turns out to be the case, I can guarantee you this is the last chance you're going to have to hurt yourself. I find it hard to believe that someone who just made the kind of entry you did... doesn't have anything to say. Judge it your way! "No one leaves" Does either of you leave the man without the cuff at any point? No. None with me. Then how do you explain this? I don't like it, Jack. Get Ray on the phone, getting some help up here. No god damned way! I don't know what kind of game this son of the bitch is just playing, but I'm not playing this time. - What do you mean "this time"? - Attemp, Stuart. He comes back here just we're leaving, single me out of everyone of those photos, bring the same hunting knife with the attemp. So why did he just showed up like this? I think he's taking someone else. His shadow throws on my face. So what does he make of that? He showed a trick. That's one of his games. And now what? We got unpacking, I guess. Im get on the radio keep talking sometimes. Just like we're getting ready to open the file back up? Yeah, now, we just try to keep it from falling apart. Uh... This morning I came from. Jessica had been that you got this. and I thought that you probably wanted to have that. That was that last day, wasn't it? The last time I saw her alive. I can't really believe they're gone, you know. Such a freak accident. Well, they never should have built that dam against me. Her and her father knew it's dangerous work, but they loved it. And she loved working with you. You're-- You're my family. and I will be with you. - Probably you could come with me? - I can't. Now I'm just thinking keeping your heir. I know. I've thought about it, but Jessica and her dad are buried here, and... Now it's just... giving me a little peace in mind, to be near them. Doc, Sheriff Sheppard, Is he there? Doc, it's Jack. - I-- - I forgot that. Wait, Darby. When you pull out tonight. Would you come by here? I have some family stopping by, and they would love to meet you. Oh. I wish I could, but got a trailer and... I want something in Pineview before it dark. - Doc, you're sure the Sheriff Deputy there? - I-I gotta go. Listen. You-you take care of yourself. Okay? And, uh, And please stay in touch. I'm to call you, as soon as I get settled. - Jack, Darby, what's up? - Are you still in town? Yeah, not much longer. Why? Uh, I'm talking to test some blood samples, you can tell me if it's human or animal. Thanks for a lot of confidence, Jack. But, uh, qualified medics. Besides, I don't really have any equipment. Improvise. It's important. Why do it haste, Jack? I can't really say. I'm getting out of here, am I, Jack? All right, meet me at the camp site and see what I can do. Stuart is already underway. Harvey. Do you think you can get on the radio, checking whenever you can, see you've seen or heard anything? All right, yeah. Stay in here. So I think it's such a night, sir. An op is too specific, we have the boy. No sympathetic in anyway. You got a deal. - Where are the walkies? - Packed up like everything else. Where are you going? He left a lot of blood I get to see it leads to anywhere. You want me to come in today, were you? We're just going to leave. Is it going to work? - This came from one person? - Off one person. As far as I can tell, the blood of three humans. What the hell is going on? I don't know. But whatever it is, it's just going to have a lot of work. Jesus Christ! What the hell is that? Help! Help me. Hang on. Mary. Mary mix, this is Har. Yeah, yeah. Sergean, have you seen anything out of your records? Someone, help! Let me alone. Help me, Jack. What the fuck is going on? God dammit, come out and show yourself. Help me, Jack. Charlie, Jay. All right. All right. Have you seen anything out on your way? Listen, look. Now, you at least see some odd kind of characters? Those just like me. Ray? Ray? Can you hear me? Oh, can you hear me? Oh. I-I turn your off. Now I get it very nice. The blood came from at least three people. Jesus! Did you hear what I just said? The blood of this case came from more than one person, at least three people if not more. - You doubly sure? - Pretty damned sure, yeah. Where is Jack? He doubts, try to track of his trail. Now where are you going? Jack should know about it, don't you think? I mean there was a shit load of blood. - Who knows what the hell the kis's done? - City boy! You're just going to get yourself lost. Besides, I need you to fingerprints on Jack. Why can you do it? You're scared to mark him? Are you going to do it or not? Where are the cards? I'd like to get this to discuss the part of you. Because children or not, you're going to pay for whatever you've done here. You see, people get tired of failing kids like you. He doesn't care the shit how sad your story is. On the search, figure it out or not. What the hell are you doing in there? What the hell happened? Stuart shot him, for no reason, like he was nothing. I can't seem to make her understand. I saw the things she does. I saw their faces, I heard them beg for her life. He had his comments. Jesus Christ, Stuart. This is Harvey, for God sake. Jack, listen to me. The boy show me it all. You guys have no idea the shit he's done. He had to pay. Come to the side, so that I figure out what's the hell just going on here. Jesus Christ, listen to me. - You have done exactly the same shit! - Shut up, Stuart. Someone out there. Here are the boy's prints you have? Yeah. "MATCH FOUND" There must be something wrong with the system. Just settle something again. Second thoughts. Get Ray on the phone, tell him that we have up here. You and I need a long talk. - Hey, Russel. - Ray, it's Laura. Laura, I just have to call you in. Is Stuart Dempsey up there with you now? Yeah. Yeah, he's here. Right, we got him in the situation. The kid showed up this morning, naked, coverd in blood. Laura, now you listen to me very carefully. You stay the hell away from him. You have no ideal what you're dealing with. I don't understand, hon. It's just a boy, right? Mark for Christ sake, do not let him touch you, he's not what he seems. Ray? Ray? Ray, I just found another 2 bodies. That makes 36 so far. What the hell is going on? I don't know. My daughter wait right now, I gotta go. Ray. I'm not doing shit, you hear me? I want to know who else is out there. If you don't want such talk, you know, the only way is to watch speaking your life. - Let go off him, Jack. - Get out of here, Laura. Come on, Jack get away from him, now. Listen to me. Listen to me. You just want to scare of that, now what you want to do, - what do you think you want? - Do not touch him, Jacky, since he said not to let him touch you. Who? Some killings happen in here. - Who are? - Ray, on the phone. He was trying to warn me about the boy when the line went dead. Hey, guys. - We need to look at this. - Not now, Stuart. Every person we need fingerprint report, they all missing a hundred miles from here. Let see here's the real kicker. If you put all the faces together, it looks a lot like a boy in there. It doen't make sense. This is not sensible times, Jack. Jack, no. Ray said stay away from him. You don't have any idea what it feels like to have your strike open. and slowly sewn back while you were still alive? What it feels like to be dried up. and every stream of blood slowly drained from your body? I still be alive but you hadn't let me, Jack. Amy? Stop. I'll do whatever you want me to do. Please stop. Aah-a-a-ah! What? What did happened? I think it's not Stuart. How can he let us out? Darby Owens to Sheriff Sheppard. Jack, it's Darby. Are you out there? Listen, Jack. I don't know if you can hear me. Maybe your power is out too, but... I took another look at the sample you sent me earlier, and... somehow it has been dead for a long time. Some time up to years. Jack, I'm getting ready to get out of here. So if I don't hear from you, I'm going to stop by the station on my way out. Over! Hello? Hello? Hello? I didn't think I hate any place more than I already did, My boy, am I wrong? I'm going to get as far away from here as possible, man. You're not seriously think you are leaving and not now. Fucking ass, Jack. 'Cause you are smart and you did exactly the same thing. You killed the man, Stuart. It's gonna to be questioned. You're goddamn right! It's going to be questioned. But what else can you believe the answer, Jack? Christ! You ain't see it yourself... like silly copy of that cell in there. Amy and the others sent that boy here for a reason. You're going to help me or I'm going to lock you in your cell again. You're going to get a lot worst, it worked better in there. I see that's pretty much a guarantee. - Do you hear that? - On our way. I'm going to get out and test the power transformer. Okay, stay here still we get back. We're gonna be sitting in the dark soon if we don't have the power back on. It is not a good idea to be out there alone now, right? Just wait until we go together. He hit a kid. He ran out in front of the bus like we are nothing. Right. I can't understand. Where is he? We've been looking. Maybe got thrown. Ever coming down, I hope pretty good, you know. - Where is the driver? - In the bus. Are you okay? - Samuel, is it? - Sam. Sam. Sam. I hope you can help me this bus to get off the road. Jack. Oh, shit! You see it stalled, not moving anywhere. - How is your head? - I had it worse. - You don't even tell who you stay with? - He can stay with me. Good. So what do you want me to do? Come with these 2 and 3 others, get them all into town. All right everybody listen now. We're gonna get everyone out of here with a truck, So it's going to be a few trips. So stay together, stay with the bus, and don't touch the blood. Laura took one of the rifles. Because, god dammit, I asked her to stay here. Do you want me to go after her? No. 'Cause I need you bring the bus into town. - I'll wait here. She's probably back soon. - All right. I'll keep an eye. Okay. - Okay, who wants some cake? - Go ahead, give her a hug. Give her a hug. - It's all right. It's all right. - Thank you. Albert. Is everything okay in there? Yeah. It's all right. Okay, first meet birthday girl. They haven't made it, going to need more deaths soon. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Amy. Happy birthday to you. Well. Wonderful! - Okay. - Change out. Okay. No. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... - Me first. - I get to take here. Open my gift. What is it? - Mama, what is it? - Please do not remind her. Don't say a word. - No way, Jack. - Don't worry, Albert. - You lift our seal, right? - Okay. Oh! - I love you, sweetheart. - I love you too. - Thank you, Mama. - Okay, who wants some cake? No. Give her a hug. Give her a hug. "OUR FATE IS YOURS" Come out, you son of the bitch! No one may leaves. Help me, Jack. Fucking shit! Helen. Helen. Helen. Hey, Jack. Where the hell these flies are coming from? - You're okay, Helen? - Oh, yeah. It's good to be praticed. I... still don't like to live in a big old house alone. Have you seen anything out of ordinary way? Well, my dog was acting up this morning. But I figured it was just a bear snooping around for scraps. - Why? - No big deal. Can I borrow your car for an hour? Oh, no. Did your jeeps break down again? Laura and Stuart have them. I thought you and Laura would marry by now. Call it "cheer", I guess. Okay, you just wait a minute, and I will find my keys. Jack. "Rescue crew finds bodies of father and daughter Jack. Jack is not there. Loose your gun. Loose it! Helen. I think I got the keys, but I don't know how much gasoline is in her. Goddamn it! Oh, shit. Don't move the goddamned asshole. - Who is it? - Where is Laura, Stuart? - I said who the hell is it? - It's Ray. Jesus Christ! Ray. You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing here? Where is Laura, Stuart? I don't know. I haven't seen her since this afternoon. Is she all right? Well, she's a little stress out, like everybody else. Things that may exactly normal around here. You know what I'm saying? Things haven't been normal anywhere for the las 24 hours, Stuart. You went for me, did you? Do you say that? Mark is dead. They found him in a patrol car this morning. Oh, my God. What happened? Remember that little junkie, Curtis Weaver? He was a dealer. Yeah. - What about him? - I hope you can tell me. Look. The only person who knows for sure what happened to Curtis is... Curtis. - And he's dead. - His dead would be a problem. And how is that my problem? Stuart, they come to clear the book, they come to make it right once and for all. - Who? - The dead. This time you're going on your own. Curtis. Get out of the car, Curtis. Don't make me fucking coming out and take the fuck you out of the car. Lets go! Come on. - You're back first. - Enough, all right? Come on. You want to work to neigborhood, you got to pay for the previlege, Curtis. For the pig damned thing. I want the payment crack boy, that was an asshole. That money ain't yours. - Now discuss, discuss. - Sure. Sure. Don't go shit me, Curtis. I know you got some cash for me. Stop. Stop. Stop. It's TJ, okay? The asshole already caught it. That's great, kid. Smart move! Goddamn you, Jack. And the but in your place. Not if you're dead, pal. "GUILTY" "Father and Daughter Killed in Dam Accident" "Hellen Reedy, 'they've Taken My Family, They've Taken My Life" "City Councilwoman Missing & Freared Dead" "Son Of Real Estate Investor Vanishes" "Daughter of Dam Supervisor Abducted" You remember how to get out to my place? Amy wanted one of this. Well, thanks to Jack. She's not around the edge, is she? - That's not Jack's fault. - He left her out there alone. He night as well as kill her himself. You can blame whoever you want. But none of that is going to change the fact that Amy is dead. No. But if Jack ever wants to see you again, he's going to find the master who did that time. "Widow Buries Husband and Daughter" Welcome to the family, Jack. Tom and Jessica are going to have you as their company. No slowing down. - Stop the truck. - Here? I said stop the goddamn truck.
