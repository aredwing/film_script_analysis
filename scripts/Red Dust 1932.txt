Guidon, that squealing liar! Before he left, he told me he'd cleaned out all the bamboo in 347. - Yes, he did. - We could use some rain. The rains will just flood us rotten if those drain ditches aren't finished. And look at those slugs! That's another one of Guidon's finished jobs. Whining for leave when I'm shorthanded. I knew he'd overstay it. He would have come up on today's boat, sure. Yeah? He tells me any more of his lies, and I'm gonna kick in his face. Not that, Denny. It's hard enough for a man to breathe up here as it is. Here she comes, for fare! That roof'll go in a minute! Here's Limey. Hey, did you bring Guidon? Yes, I dropped him. He's home to stay all right. The prodigal is returned. He's got a lot of nimble explaining to do. Maybe he's already pawned in here. ? These dust storms... are something like the fogs off the coast of Labrador Only the result is different. Hold up a whole day's distilling. Tomorrow, you and Guidon take a clearing squad Mr. Guidon come back, him very happy see me. Me hit like hell to see him. Grab his feet. Smells like he could have been drinking benzene. At that, he'd sell pretty well in the States, if you put a label on his chest and sealed up both ends. All right...Heave! Hey! What's the idea? You poor sap... How many times do I have to tell you, you haven't a chance of... Well, for the love of mud! Where am I sleeping, on a race track? Come on, let's have it. Who are you? Where'd you come from? Don't rush me, brother. I'm Pollyanna, the glad girl. I see. Came on up the boat with him, eh? I came up on the boat, sure, but not with that. He was in the steerage, as far as I was concerned. I thought I had convinced this drunken... Get him out of here, will you? Why did you get off the boat at all? You know it doesn't stop here again for four weeks, don't you? Sure, I do. Think I'm overjoyed about it? But it's just got to be, that's all. - Well then? - I left the boat here for the same reason I took it at Saigon. - What reason? I got mixed up in a little trouble and I thought I'd stay away out of town until the gendarmes forgot about it. And what a cast-iron nerve you got! You have to have in my line. But don't worry, big boy, I'll stay out from under foot. I'll even pay for my board if you insist on it nicely. You're the head man around here, aren't you? - Come on, Mac. - You're not gonna leave the corpse here? It's his room. Didn't you know? Honest, I didn't. I just took the first room the houseboy showed me. Oh please, you guys. This place is full of lizards and cockroaches as it is. One more won't hurt. You know, Denny, she might be able to sew. I haven't got a pair of pants to my name with a full set of buttons on them. It's bad enough having to play around with them in Saigon, much less have one in your house. Not bad-looking. That doesn't change her. Aha! Beans! What happened to that quarter of beef? You leave the refrigerator door open again? Yes, sir, Mr. Denny. Ice all water. You don't want the beef now. All stinky! Stinky! Better eat something, Denny. Yeah, later maybe. Mac...did you ever want to quit? Oh, sure. I quit your old man once. When I sobered up in Singapore I saw a Britisher loading rubber, and I turned around and came back. The company's made me a swell offer. I could sell out pretty. - But you won't. You was born smelling rubber and sweating to get it and you'll die that way. You think so? Do you think I'll spend my whole life in this dry rot just so the rest of the world can ride around on balloon tires? - Sure you will. - Who says so? Why should I spend the rest of my days worrying about guys like Guidon? Kicking a herd of crawling coolies around... fighting fever... swallowing dust one month, wading in mud the next, just so some old woman can take her hot water bottle to bed with her? Yeah and just as long as there's one baby in the world to suck on a rubber nipple. Now, listen, Dennis, you've got your yearly case of nerves. Now why don't you go down to Saigon and... to blow the lid off? Get a laugh out of your liquor? With this outfit running away as it is, how am I going to get to Saigon? Well, as a matter of fact, what came up from Saigon isn't so bad-looking. I've been looking at her kind ever since my voice changed. Let's lay off tomorrow, and knock that fellow over. I never got time. Don't mind me, boys. I'm just restless. Hello, Polly. I thought you were going back to sleep. Not with that alley cat yodelling out there. Guess I'm not used to sleeping nights anyway. Listen. Tomorrow you and Guidon see about clearing a road down to that creek area. I thought you were going to let that wait until that new survey engineer fellow... - You mean Willis? - Yeah. He's due on Limey's next trip up, isn't he? Yes, but I'm not counting on him. Probably some textbook ingenue like the last one. What's Polly's name? She never had one. Well I'll have to tend to that. You can't have a poor bird without a name. You just tend to minding your own business. This place certainly reeks of hospitality and good cheer. Or maybe it's this cheese. Oh, gorgonzola! My favorite tango! Mr. Denny, you no want eat? No, clear this stuff. You won't grow up to be a big strong boy like grandpa here if you don't eat your din-din, Fred. Say listen, Lily, as long as you've got to use it, the name's Dennis Carson. Okay, Fred. This name is Vantine, as long as you've got to use it. Don't worry, I won't have much occasion to. Nice light-hearted little fellow, isn't he? We've had a hard day's work, Vantine. What else do you do besides work? Don't you know any games? If it was the summer of 1894, I'd play games with you, sister. But life is much simpler now. I bet you painted your hometown red! I'll say I did. Good night, Denny. - Good night, Mac. - Good night. Here... Cut that out and eat something. You'll just get stewed. - I never get stewed. What if I did? Would it turn your hair gray? No, but it'll put red spots on your liver. Especially if you don't eat something. Come on, big boy, I know you've had a hard day in the office. Get out of here! Put the rest of that cheese in your mouth, where it'll do the most good. I'll go quietly, officer. That's roquefort, the other's gorgonzola. - I happen to like roquefort. - I like gorgonzola. Is there any brand that would stop you from talking? I'll order a ton of it. I'll keep quiet. You know you wouldn't like roquefort if you knew the way it was made. They've got a whole town that does nothing but make roquefort somewhere in France. I was reading about it the other day. It comes from sheep's milk, did you know that? And they do the rottenest things to the sheep... Ewes, don't they call 'em? Before they milk them, the sheep people slap them all around underneath to make the milk thicker and then they put it in a cave and... I don't care where it's made or who slaps who. All I want you to do... - You don't have to snarl about it. There are a lot of people who would be mighty interested to know how they slap cheese... I'm not interested in cheese. You said you liked roquefort and I was just telling you how they slap it out... You want me to slap you out of this room? You and what man's army? If you don't keep quiet I'm gonna lock you up in one of the outhouses. What would you think of that? I'd still like roquefort. I mean gorgonzola! There, I knew you had a laugh in you, that's perfect. Shake and go to the head of your class. Now wait a minute, Fred. Come here. Hey! You talk too much, but you're a cute little trick at that. Why haven't you been around before? You change your mind quick enough. Your hair's always been that color? Always been a towhead. And you always shut your face off that way? Well, I like that! Hello, Lily! Hello, Lily! Well... Goodbye, Denny. Goodbye, kid. It's been nice having you. - Where's the rest of that beer lot? - Coming up! Gee, Denny, I don't want any ceremony but... but... turn around and give me the works. What? Oh, I'm forgetting the expenses, huh? Oh, Denny, no. - What's the matter? - Please, don't. This wasn't like that. Where's that fellow, Willis? Did you bring him? He's in the port cabin. Here you are, kid. It isn't half enough. But when I get down to Saigon, there'll be more. Keep your chin up. Willis? - Mr. Carson? - Right. Gary Willis, I take it. Got any more luggage? Yes? Babs, this is Mr. Carson. My wife. Your who? Mrs. Willis. - Oh. How do you do? - Well, thank you. A rather longer trip than we expected. What's the matter? Dizzy? Gary's been feeling the heat a little more than usual today. - Oh, I'm all right. - Take it up to the house. Mr. Carson will see that you run a nice cold tub, darling. He looks like he's ready for one himself. Thanks, dear. This is Mac, Mr. and Mrs. Willis. How do you do. This way, lad. We'll get the duffel up. My, it's good to be here! Where's the plantation? That's it. - I mean the main house. - That's it. Why? Is it a big shock to you? Well, of course, I haven't been inside yet. Well, you're a big shock to me. What do you mean? I didn't expect you at all. Gary darling, wait a moment. - Kind of rustic and pioneering, isn't it? - Yes. - We can't live the rest of our lives in the bridal suite, darling. - No. But where do you take a bath? Would the lady like to take a bath? I show you. See? Pretty lady just take off clothes. Hold the water top side of head. Water goes all over. But isn't there any curtain? No, no curtain. Take a bath, talk with people in here, same time. That will be fixed, darling. - Where's our room? - Follow Hoy. Nice room, very nice. Nice room. Very nice. - That's all. - All right, me come again. Babs, I didn't know it was going to be like this. I may as well face it, this is no place for you. Here now, any place is my place, where you are. And I'll put a curtain on that bath place, I'm gonna get a broom, and some soap and water for this room... And I'll... Why darling, what's the matter? Here now, you're all worried and hot and excited, all at once, and that's bad. Take your coat off and lie down. Heat never hit me like this before. It's gone now. Men think they can stand anything. Gosh. You think we can stand this bed? Who else is going to? Pardon me. I feel like a fool, landing here this way. You've no idea how anxious I am to get started working, Mr. Carson. Say, there's a great new mulch for replanting I wanted to talk to you about. Yes, lie down, will you? Let me see your tongue. Say, what's the idea of all this? That's quinine. Give him four right away. And here's a bromide. It will give him a good night's rest, and he needs that. Here's the thermometer. Take his temperature every four hours and let me know. - Is there anything really wrong with me? - Yes. You've got the start of a good attack of fever. - Fever? - Listen Carson, are you... Now stop getting excited, both of you. It's the surest way to help it along. Get him undressed and under the covers. You'll pull through if you follow orders. Mr. Carson. - I'd like to speak to you a moment. - Certainly. - Now, Babs! - I'll only be a moment, Gary. Mr. Carson, I wonder if you really... Of course, we must get a doctor at once. The nearest doctor's in Saigon. That's three days down and three back. Then we must go back with the boat. Frankly, I'd just as soon you did. But I've got a little conscience left. He'd likely be dead by the time you got there. Now, all I want you to do is to keep your head. He'd be burning up by tomorrow night. But if he's here with me instead of being bumped about in that cigar box, he'll have a chance. I've only missed out on a couple, and I've had dozens. I won't stand for this! Do you think you can treat Gary like one of your coolies? Why not? He's just another worker on the place. Only he's coming down with the fever and therefore isn't quite as valuable. I won't have you talk like that! I never... - I know you won't. The only excuse you have for being here is to help take care of him. Now get in there and give him that quinine and take a little yourself while you're at it. Give him all the water he wants and more. The china boy will give you whatever else you need. You're not going to leave him? You're not going out? Yes. I work here. You don't expect me to sit around and hold his hand, do you? All right. If that makes you feel any better. What was that? That was a tiger. A tiger? He sounded so close. He just sits out there in the bush and swears at us every now and then. He won't come within a hundred yards of the compound. Now don't give him another thought. I see. If you're sure he won't. I... I 'm sorry about this morniing. Let me apologize. It's quite unnecessary, really. You know, running a plantation sometimes gets on the nerves. With your husband arriving sick and wondering just how you were going to fit into the scheme of things here... You don't have to explain anything. All you've got to do is to get Gary through this. Of course. I need him almost as badly as you do. You... gave him that bromide? Yes, he's asleep. Is there anything more I should do? No, let him sleep as late as he can in the morning, and I'll look at him then. - I will. - By the way... my room is that front one off the porch, If you should want me during the night. - Thank you. - Are we friends now? Does that really matter so much at the moment, Mr. Carson? Good night. Lady scared of the cat? Why not? She probably never thought of one except in the zoo. She's beautiful, isn't she? Very. Only don't start telling her, will you? Reserving that privilege for yourself? Explain the joke and I'll die laughing. Somebody would have had a lot of explaining to do if she and Vantine had ever met. What would you have said, Denny? Called it your sister? No, we'd have panned her off better as your governess. Can you imagine the mixed feminine population we would have had then? That's one trouble we haven't got, so let's forget it. She's gone and... - Hi there! Hey, you guys still up? Hey, where's the reception committee? It's been a nice little walk. Did you hear that hungry pussycat back there? I'd begun to feel like a porterhouse steak. What's the idea? I bounced back, that's all. One month up here and I turn into a rubber check. What happened? You tell him, Admiral. I want to get away from these eagles. A disaster, gentlemen. A blooming disaster. Well come on, out with it! Let's have it. I ain't saying how it happened... But we got past the rapids all right. And I'd just left the bridge to go down to get a pot of tea and before you knew it, that orangatang at the wheel runs the nose right in the mud bank. The current gets her in deeper, and tried to pull her out, a shaft snaps in two... like a stick of macaroni. That old shaft's been due to snap for the last twenty odd years. That boat's a sister ship to the Ark! And Noah here couldn't understand why I wouldn't stay onboard with a bunch of monkeys. What was the matter with using the tender? Tender? I'll say it was. We put it in the water and the bottom dropped out. How long is that boat going to be laid up? Well, I gotta get a couple of boys trekking down to Saigon for help, and by the time I get a new shaft and propeller in it, it'll be, let me see now... It'll be at least six weeks, even if you're lucky. I guess you're right, Mr. Carson. I'm not lucky this season. Well, you boys can stay here and give the story to the papers, I'm gonna drop the body in the hay. Just a minute. You'll be much more comfortable upstairs. Willis brought his wife. Oh, a lady! Now no noise, you understand? Willis is up to his gills in the fever. What a pleasant little house party this is gonna be! Never mind about that. Get upstairs and keep quiet. Me very glad, Miss Van come back. Very glad. Hoy old pal, that's nice to hear from someone, even though you are slightly simple-minded. Thank you. I make new kind of biscuits. Special for Miss Van. Say, which tree did this one ooze out of? Miss Van tell funny joke! Oh, funny! Clear that brush out on 291. - Hey, Mac! - Yeah? That old bullock's gone lame. I'll look after it, Denny. Gary, don't! Babs, I'm not sick. If I get up and move around, and stop thinking about it... You don't know how sick you are. Now, please, dear. Where's Carson? He'll know I'm all right by just looking at me. I know, but you can't get up. You've got to stay in bed. I'll speak to Mr. Carson and see what you can have for breakfast. - All right. - That's a boy. - Oh! Good morning. - Hello. We haven't met but don't let that stop you if you're hungry. I was looking for Mr. Carson. He's outside, being noisy about something or other. You better sit down and drink your pinapple juice before it starts cooking. As you say, we haven't met. I'm Mrs. Willis. Yeah I know, they told me about your husband. How is he today? I hope we can get a doctor. Oh, these fool doctors! Even if you did get one, why, all he'd do is sit by the side of the bed and start crabbing the government for not stamping out fever. Then they prescribe brandy and have to sample themselves to see if it's any good, and by the time you're deciding whether to live or die, they're under the bed singing "Sweet Adeline" You seem to be very familiar with the country. Are you... married to one of the men here? Do you think I'd live in a menagerie like this? I've been visiting my brother. He has the next plantation below here, and it's a lovely place. You know he copied it from our old family plantation in Bluefield, West Virginia. Have you ever been to Bluefield? No, I haven't. We're the Jeffersons there. I'm Vantine Jefferson. You know, I was supposed to be happy about staying home and marrying the son of another FFB. But I'm just the restless, adventurous type I guess. I had to come out to stay with my brother and see the world. Then you're visiting here too. Oh no! But how I got here! Mr. Carson nearly died laughing. I got on a boat to go down to Saigon, you know, to do a little shopping? And the boat turns back to pick up some elastics or something and gets stuck in the mud. My dear, and I had to walk back through the jungle! Wait'll the folks back in Richmond hear about this. Aren't you gonna drink your pineapple juice? When Mr. Carson comes in, will you tell him I want to see him? Yes, madam. You didn't believe a word of it, did you? Did you expect me to? No. But there was a guy on the next plantation, even though he wasn't my brother. and that story about the boat's all true, see? I haven't any connection here at all, whether you believe it or not. Why Denny, you're all shaved and dressed up fancy! You even smell good. What have you been telling her? You don't think I'd... Say, I know when to keep my mouth shut. - I hope so. I merely said I came from the next plantation and the boat broke down. She'll believe that if you'll back me up. I don't want to crawl in and dirty up her goldfish bowl. Now listen, this woman's decent. You watch your language and stop running around here half-naked. - I'll stay as comfortable as I like. - You'll go back to Saigon. On what? That speedboat stuck in the mud? No. Slung in a hammock through the bush. Oh, I see. Two weeks in the swamp playing tag with your trusted coolies at night. I guess that would be good enough for me. You can keep your mouth shut and keep out of the way. Pretty lady want see Mr. Denny. All right. Now remember what I said. Say, Denny. What? Oh, nothing. You look kind of cute, that's all. Gary, I told you not to get up. You shouldn't. Come in! He insisted on getting up. - Not obeying orders, eh? Hoy! Bring me some blankets, snap into it! Gosh! What hit me? Fever chills. You've got to get used to them for a couple of days. Get me a coat, anything. - Denny, can I help? - Yes, tell Mac to go on out. - Get me the medicine box, Hoy. - Yes, sir. You won't leave him now, will you? You'll stay? Naturally. There are things to be done. Come on, boy, dig in your heels. Here. Hi, Doc. How am I doing? Great. Eat your spinach. The rest of your milk. All of it now. Well, it looks as though you were gonna stay married. He's really through it? There's no more chance... - He'll be outside working in a week. I don't know what to say. You'd better think about getting some sleep. I know I am. I mean, when I think of what I did the first day we came... slapping you. And here, ever since... it's been almost three days, you stayed with him practically every minute, pulling Gary through this terrible... Don't you see how ashamed I am? Oh that. I... Out here we all slap each other sooner or later. You're just getting it out of your system a little early, that's all. Well, apologies or even thanks would be silly now. I just want you to know that I owe you a great deal. I'll take your IOU. Remember now. Don't hesitate to call me if you need me. I won't, thanks. - Good night. - Good night. What are you doing here? - I was just roaming around. - Yeah? Go to bed. Nobody asked you to lose any sleep. - How is he, Denny? - He's through it. Oh, gee, that's swell. He's such a nice kid. Say, what's this? Some new kind of an alarm clock? It doesn't seem to ring or tick at all. - Hey! It was a barometer! I wouldn't swear to it now. Say listen, if you're just roaming around, keep it up, will you? I'm dead on my feet. I'm sorry, Dennie, can't I... Here. Let me get those. There. Denny, have you got a headache? Maybe. I don't know. Would you like me to rub your forehead? No. Could I get you a drink or something? No thanks. Beat it to bed, will you? Let's forget about the drink. I'll just rub your forehead with sandpaper! No, we'll just let Willis go out and look around today. I thought I'd show him that roadside and then where we're going to lay out the new stand on... I don't care what you show him! Let him get his bearings andl know where he's at. We'll find out soon enough if he knows his business. Well, don't bite my arm off. What's the matter with you? Hey, aren't you going out with us? No, I'm not. You were mean not to awaken me. I wanted to see you off on your first day. You need all the sleep you can get for a while. You lost plenty over me. All the trouble I've been to everybody around here. Dennis is a prince, isn't he? He was rather wonderful. Believe me, I'm going to try to make it up to him. Wish me luck, darling. You don't need it, you're good. I've got to hurry, they're waiting. Bye, honey. Now don't worry... - Here. I don't know what time we'll be back. What the... Hey! Hey! How many times have I told you to let down those curtains? Why? They've all gone off to work. You heard me. Let them down! What's the matter? Afraid I'll shock the Duchess? Don't you suppose she's ever seen a French postcard? You'll let those curtains down or this is the last bath you'll ever have. Get out of there! Hey, what's the idea? - What? - Getting in that barrel? Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'm going over Niagara Falls. You're supposed to rinse off with that gourd. Hey, listen. You know we drink that water? Yeah, well you won't this. Unless you're stubborn and insist on it. Come on, get out! Oh, don't, Denny. I'm in it now, stop! No, don't, Denny! Gee! Can't a girl take a bath in privacy without... Oh, good morning! You're just in time to see the trained seal. Hey, Denny, scrub my back. Get back in that barrel. Don't, Denny! You just said you didn't want me in it. One more occurence like this and you'll live in that shack across the river. I will not! And if you think I give a... Pardon the disturbance. One of the guests was misusing the plumbing. I thought you'd gone with Gary. No, I'm...tied up here this morning. What are your plans? I thought I'd take a walk before it gets too hot. By the way, you haven't had much of a chance to see what goes on here. Would you like to see how we make the stuff? Why... Why, yes. I'd love to. Okay. Should I put on some boots? No, you're all right. Thank you. - Good morning, Bob. - Good morning, sir. Here's where we find out what a bad day we've had. - Why, it's milk! - Oh no, just rubber. But you could drink it if you care to stretch a point. I once knew a man who made a joke like that. He was run over by a truck. - Were you driving it? - Yes! - You're out of luck here. We only have ox carts, and every ox knows me personally. Here's where the milk turns to cheese. You know, it usually takes three hours or more, but for your entertainment, I'll perform a miracle. You see, nothing up the sleeves... no trap doors, no mirrors... All visible to the naked eye. Just pour in acetic acid. The more acid, the quicker the liquid rubber resents the insult, and stiffens up into an indignant mass. There. Crude rubber. Well, I can't believe it. But how does it... Master cook refuses to roll it thin enough. You're a strange lot of civilized barbarians... working and living your whole lives out here. Somebody's got to do it. But don't you ever miss the people and the comforts of the outside world? Don't you ever get tired of this? We go on fighting it and grumbling about the life but we're born to it. Perhaps it's hard for a woman to understand. A little. I just realised that I've seen but one woman since I've been here. For instance, where are the wives of all these natives? Back country, in the villages. They've got to sign on without them. You mean you don't allow wives on your plantation? Women don't belong here, white or native. If they're white, they can't stand the gaffe. If they're native, one of them is bound to drift from the coolies' quarters, and end up waiting on you at breakfast. And that's curtains for a man in this country. Here's something that might interest you. This is... what pencil erasers look like before they're born. There you are. See all the little pencil erasers trying to erase each other? Yes. What about that girl... back at the house. Vantine, isn't it? Yes, what about her? I mean... Is she a part of the life here? Very definitely. If a man wants to be interested. - Big rain's coming. - Yeah! Perhaps we'd better get back to the house. - Is there going to be a storm? - Usually it only threatens this time of the year. It's a little early for the monsoon. Look out for the traffic! I'd have walked right into it. I was wool gathering. No profit in wool these days! What about? Well, you said... that a white woman out here couldn't stand "the gaffe", as you called it. Perhaps I was thinking of my mother. Her grave is on the hill at the far edge of the compound. You know, I faintly remember asking my father if he was digging a well. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. However, I'm not forcasting any such dark future for you. But don't you really think I could fit in out here? Don't you think that I could be happy? Would you mind if I made it my job to see that you are? Well, I want everyone to like me out here. That's not difficult. I have a special fondness for somebody who stands up and fights back. Particularly if she's a woman who looks extraordinarily beautiful when she's doing it. And even more beautiful when she's calmed down. That's a very polished little speech for a... barbarian. You admitted the barbarian was civilized, didn't you? Why, I've forgotten what I said. Are you going to forget what I said? - Goodness, what's happening? - Come on, we've got to make it! Hoy, hurry up, you idiot! Peep, peep! Like you, water! Better be nice! Better be quite nice! Thank you. Please, let me down. Aren't you comfortable? Why... We shouldn't have done that. But we did. - Hoy! Tell them to saddle up. - All right. Did the Duchess sprain her ankle? It must be wonderful to be big and strong. Think how all the girls... Be careful the rain doesn't wash the rouge off your mouth! Do you mind if I stay in here with you? Think you can stand the company? Please, it's... It's just that I... Pity the poor sailors on a night like this. Dear little sailors! How long is it going to keep up? Does it ever stop, even for a minute? Not even for lunch. Stop playing stoop tag. You'll know it if you're hit. Here. Put this inside you. All of it. It'll make you forget a lot of things. That was nice of you. It's stupid of me to be so frightened. This storm isn't the only thing that has you worried around here, is it? I saw him kick the door shut. He came out with rouge all over his mouth. Why... I suppose he asked to use your lipstick! I don't know how it happened. I didn't do anything. He didn't have any reason to believe that I'd... I didn't hear any cries for help. I don't know what came over me. I should have stopped him. I tried but... - But you couldn't. Even when you tried... Could you? No. That's why I'm scared. Oh, it's too silly! What do I mean I'm scared? It was just one of those excitement-of-the-moment things. Well, watch out for the next moment, honey. It's longer than the first. Gosh, these peaches are good. I never ate so much in my life, how about that? You know, ever since we were married that one over there has been after me for not eating enough. Guess you're not worried about me wasting away after this meal, are you, Mrs. Willis? You have rather stuffed yourself. That's what a full day's work will do for you. Full day's work? I'll say it was. Those coolies are tough to handle, aren't they? Didn't I tell you they were a lazy bunch? I mean, I didn't know they were so sneaky about it. The minute you turn your back on them, they're up to something or other they shouldn't be doing. Are they always like that? - I'm afraid so. I was telling him about the time that malay tried to knife you in the back. It's a great country for that sort of thing. I guess Mac could have used you out there today. But I imagine you had plenty to do around here. You should have seen us, Babs. We were up to our knees in water trying to get a drain ditch through to the main channel. And every time we looked for a coolie... Hey, darling! What game are you playing? What's the score? Babs! - What? - Set them up in the other alley! - Oh Gary, please don't! Babs! This little taste of bad weather we've had today is enough to upset anybody, if they're not used to it. Why don't you turn in early? I think I will if you'll all excuse me. Good night. - Good night. - I'll be in soon, darling. - All right, dear. I might have realized, all that thunder and lightning today... Gee, I'm dumb. No, how were you to know? Well Gary, now that you're in shape again, we can start out on the first real job I have for you. Great! You know me. You and Mac and Guidon will leave here tomorrow, take a full crew. Camp down below the south creek for the next 3 or 4 weeks. Remember? I started to tell you about it the other day. There's that 500 acres I want you to survey. Lay out a course for best drainage, then throw up a bridge over the creek and cut through a road leading back to the compound, for shortest and easiest hauling. We can't do that job now, Denny. The rains have started. It's a nice time to pick for it. What's the matter with you guys? Getting soft? This plantation's got to increase production. Okay, Denny, if you're dead set on it. Well believe me, I am. I've got to begin to earn my salt here. Let me see: Three or four weeks. What about Babs? Will it be all right for her? If she wants to go, but I think it would be foolish to take her. Down in them swamps? Why, that's no place for a woman, boy. There won't be a dry blanket in the outfit. No, it's tough enough for a man. But I'll be riding down every now and then while you're there. Maybe I could bring her along for a visit. - Fine! I'd better go in and see if there's anything I can do for her. I'll come back later and talk it over. The morning's time enough, just a few details. Right. Come on, you fellows. We've got to cover up those vats. That's a sensible girl. You must be dreadfully tired, Gary. Silly! You'd better be pretty nice to me, lady. I'm gonna leave you widowed for three or four weeks. Why... what do you mean? Dennis is sending me out on my first field trip. Mac, Guidon and I are leaving in the morning. I asked Dennis if you could go along, darling. He says it's an awfully rotten area, even for a man. Gary... - Yes? - Maybe I... Well...maybe I'd better go. But do you really think you could stand it down there? It's nothing but a swamp, you know. Sleeping in tents, in the wet and everything. What do you think? I don't know what to think. It's all right, darling. Hey. Yeah? A few days ago you said something about sending me back to Saigon, in a hammock through the bush. You've been behaving yourself. Maybe. Bring on the hammock and the coolies, will you? What's the matter with you? Crazy? Just a little nauseated. This rain seems to have uncovered a pile of garbage around here. Stop looking through keyholes. It's bad for the eyes. Can I have the coolies? Nice, speedy ones? No. I can't spare one. I'll reduce your rent, however. Increasing production, eh? Listen, what goes on here is my business. Suppose I were to tell that nice white kid. He'd make it his business, wouldn't he? Suppose I tell him myself. Okay, mark it station 30 plus 24. Station 30 plus 24. Can't you whistle another tune? That's all I've heard for three weeks. Maybe Dennis will bring my saxophone when he comes. You didn't know I had one, did you? Yeah? When's he coming, that's what I wanna know. Look, Miss Van! Goodness, you even find them in the jungle. Pretty lady pretty pants, peep peep! Yeah, a lady! That's why he's so nuts about her. Mr. Denny very very happy. Mr. Denny got love. He's in love all right. The real thing too, I guess. Of all the people in the world! Miss Van never been in love? Hoy thought one time you and Mr. Denny... - Never mind about that! - Yes, Miss Van. What you been eating? Cement? - Mrs. Willis, clean clothes. - Come in. - Where Hoy put this? - Any place over there, Hoy. All right. - Hoy! - Here, Mr. Denny. Did you put that new lamp in Mrs. Willis's room? Yes, Mr. Denny. You'll find a couple more pheasants hanging up in the back shed. Fix them for dinner tonight. You know, the way Mrs. Willis likes them. Yes, Mr. Denny. Can I come in? Wait a minute. All right, come in. I... Did you get the lamp all right? Yes, thanks so much. Does it light up all right? Lights up perfectly. I heard you order the pheasants. Well, I thought you might like a little change. Yes...a change. I'm glad. You're glad? I never thought this could happen. What? I'm afraid I'm pretty crazy about you. Always? For keeps? And after that too. We'll get out of this rotten country. I've always known that some day... We'll have a swell time, Babs. Don't call me Babs, dear. Do you mind? Why not? Oh. Say, look... I've got to go down river today. They're having a little trouble with the coolies. - You'll see him? - Yes. Are you gonna tell him so soon? Sure. Might as well get it over with. Now? No, can't we just... - Oh, Dennis maybe... - Want to back out? Oh, no. But he's so...helpless. Well, it's just a tough break. Oh, Dennis, you'll come back to me? Day after tomorrow. - I'm frightened. - What of? Say, at that, it might be better if... Did Gary leave you a gun? - It isn't that. You do love me, don't you? Want it in writing? Goodbye, kid. It's only for a couple of days, and then... Goodbye, dear. Now listen. I'm going down river and probably won't be back till morning. If you can't be pleasant to her while I'm gone, just keep out of her way, understand? Oh, that's too bad! She and I could have had such a lovely day. Just two girls together with so much in common. You heard me. I thought we might run up a few curtains and make a batch of fudge, while we were planning what to wear to the country club dance Saturday night. Just remember, Lily: All those lame cracks won't help you any if I come back and find out you've been annoying her in any way. Oh, I wouldn't touch her with your best pair of rubber gloves! Hey! Hey, Denny! Here's the boss! Hello, boys! I hear you're having a little cat trouble. Yes, he's a big tom tiger! The first bullock was chewed up last week. Same old story. I can't convince them he isn't a man-eater. Can't haul any more lumber for his bridge. The brave fellows won't go in and cut it out. All like that. If you can't get them back to work, Denny, nobody can. The quickest way to fix that is to put a little lead in the friendly cat. Did the runners spot it? - He was over the rim of the hill last night. Let's have a look. We'll put up some blinds, and stake out a few bullocks tonight. Babs didn't feel like coming down, huh? - Why, no... - You see, I was... I was sort of expecting it. It's a long hard trip, you know, bad weather and all. She... She didn't send a note or anything? No, as a matter of fact, she didn't have time. I came right away, just yelled in that I was going as they brought the horse around. She...sends her love of course. She couldn't send very much... I brought most of it along with me. How's your work been coming? I'll take you over everything I've done tomorrow. I think you'll be pleased about it. I've worked night and day to rush the job, I... I sure want to get back to the house. - Hey, Mac - What? We'll each take a blind tonight, you take Gary in with you. Okay Denny. Couldn't I stick along with you? Mac and I have been cooped up so long together we haven't got a new joke between us. - Sure, if you like. - Then we can talk things over. That cat'll be good and hungry again. He'll start stalking one of the baits soon after sundown. Yeah. - That's a mighty nice lad, Denny. - I guess he is. But just as you thought, he'll never make the grade. Poor lad. He wants to make good, too. His fever came back on him a little bit yesterday, but he sat up all night going over his charts. And say, to hear him talk about you, he'd cut off both his legs if you gave him the word. - Better stake out that other bullock. - Okay, Denny. Say...Can I have first shot at him? If you guarantee you won't miss. Well, you'll be right there. I'd give anything to be able to take the hide back to Babs. Let's get up. It's something like spearing sunfish with a lantern. Only not so easy. Nothing's easy down in this country. That's what makes the life worth living, I say. What are you going to do after you leave here? Oh, I don't know. That's a little far ahead to think of now, I guess. I always thought I'd like to go on doing this sort of thing, go to South America, you know, expeditions? That was B.B. - B.B.? - Yeah! Before Babs. Oh. You must think I'm an awful ass, to keep talking about Barbara this way all the time. No. Here's your gun. I always feel a fellow can talk about things that are close and intimate to him when he's with a guy who... well...who understands. That's why I'm not at all ashamed to tell you, I'd fold up without Babs. Just being away from her this long has proven that. This would be a bad country to raise children in, wouldn't it? - Oh, I don't know. - See... Babs and I were going to have children right away, and this job came up. Kids. First a couple of boys, and then a girl perhaps. Will I walk down the main street! I guess we'll wait until we get back home. Before we left, we bought a piece of property outside New York up on the Hudson. We're going to build and settle down there. It's only 35 miles from New York, and it's real rural country. A guy can commute... Babs will be right there with all the people she's known and grown up with. All our closest friends have settled there too. And it'll be a swell place for the children. And when their Uncle Dennis comes up from the tropics, he can tell them about the time their dad shot a tiger as he charged ruthlessly through the... - Keep quiet, will you? What's the matter? I thought you said we could talk until it got dark? Well, we won't talk anymore. Better not. Yay! You got him! Gee, that was a swell shot. He was too fast for me. Gee! Look at it! Gee, what a thrill that was. I'm going home tonight, Mac. Get my horse. But it's a rotten ride this late, Denny! I have to go, I tell you. All right! Feel like you could eat some supper? Not particularly. I guess you must be pretty well done in at that. You take my cot, and turn in right after chow. I got the most comfortable cot in the outfit. No, I'm going back right now. - Going back? - Yeah. I've got a fresh batch of young trees coming through for coagulation tomorrow, and I gotta be on hand. I thought we could spend the morning going over everything I'd done. No, I'll leave it to you guys. Mac says you're doing great. - Say, I think it's too much for you. - Can't be helped. Goodbye, kid. So long, Denny. Bye, Denny! It doesn't seem at all worthwhile for Denny to go back this way. Six hours in the dark. Through this weather. You ought to know whether it's worthwhile or not. What do you mean? Just what I say. You ought to know your wife better than I do. What the devil are you driving at? Why do you suppose he sent you up on this job for? He got you up and out of the house as soon as you could walk, didn't he? Why, the night before we left, it was an open book on both their faces there was something up. He's been making a play for your wife ever since... - Hey! - Why, you... - Cut it, you two! - Get him and hold him! - Did you hear what he said? Why... - Now wait. Don't pay any attention to his drunken mouth, lad. He's been drinking all day, and whenever he gets that way, he always gets ugly about Denny. Now forget it. All right, Mac. Okay. Hey, Limey! Hello, Mr. Carson! What are you doing so far off the manor this time of the night? Communing with nature? When will you get fixed up? All ship-shape again. We'll be dropping her back again in the morning, and then I'll head back and pick up that little girl with the golden locks, eh? Yes. Won't you come aboard and take a nip? I'm just about to wring the neck off another bottle. No, thanks. See you tomorrow, Limey. Aye aye, sir! Well, if it ain't old Master Fred, back after all these years! Is the burial private? Or didn't you bring the body with you? You don't look a day older than when you went away. We just loved your postcard. My, you ought to see how little Emily's grown. And the twins... Thanks, old man. Don't care if I do. Well now, tell me everything you've been doing. Guidon sends you his love. How is dear, dear Guidon? As divine as ever? Say, what's ever become of... What's his name, that young fellow with the attractive wife? You'd be surprised. Dear me! And he was so nice too. Treacherous climate down here. Where did you get that kimono? Now Fred, don't change the subject! What are you trying to do, get drunk? That's not a bad idea. What is it? Did your team win? No, we lost. What's the matter? Wet field? Sloppy. Sticky. You know what I've just been? - What? - I've been noble! I give you Saint Dennis, the big sacrifice boy. Oh...there isn't gonna be any funeral. Sure, mine. With a lily in my hand! Little Denny is an angel now with a harp and a big, round, rosy halo. Fred, I'm awful glad. Are you? Well, I'm not. Of all the sap tricks. He is a nice white kid, isn't he? What are you gonna do about... I don't know. I'll fix it up tomorrow. You were pretty close to something there, Fred. - Yeah. - Maybe you aren't out yet. She'll get over it. I was thinking more about you. Forget it! Mind if I get a little drunk with you, Fred? So you went noble, eh? Hallelujah, brother! Come here. - Why! Mr. Carson! - Come here, you lug! Well, it's about time! Welcome home, stranger. You're not a bad kid, Lily. You know about us? We belong here. They don't, those two. Ah, it's a dirty rotten country. And we're dirty rotten people, I suppose, eh? - Sure. - Who is? - You are! - Take that back! Dennis! Wouldn't you know it! Sorry we woke you up. Are you? We were just kidding. Dennis! Well Fred, it's not too late. I don't want you here! Why, certainly. Okay, Fred, you can check the wings and halo at the desk. - I'll be right up, Vantine. - Dennis! What? - What did you mean? - I meant what I said. - What's happened to you? - Figure it out for yourself. - You're drunk. - Sure I'm drunk. That's why I'm telling you the truth. You want to hear some more truth? I didn't say anything to your husband down there and I'm glad I didn't. I've just been kidding you all the time, and everybody knew about it. - Stop it! - If you want to come down here, you come down under our rules. And if you want to cheat on your husband, that's okay with me. And I'm the boy you're looking for. - Stop it! And let me tell you this: I'm not a one-woman man, I never have been and I never will be. And if you wanna take your turn... All right, if it makes you feel any better. - Denny! - I'm hit. Where? I'm finding out. - No bull's eye? - Naw! Babs! What's the matter? What happened? - I shot him. - Why? - Because he...because he... - Because I made a pass at her. Oh, Gary! Help me. Help me! Then you haven't... Guidon said that you and... Guidon's a liar! You ought to be proud of her. This bozo's been after her every minute. And tonight he comes in drunk and tries to break into her room and she shoots him. The way any virtuous woman, with a beast like that... If I were you, Mr. Willis, I'd take her away from here, and the quicker the better. And now, as long as you aren't dead, I suppose we'll have to save your rotten life! Hoy! I thought you were a great guy. Never mind about me. The boat will get here in the morning, see? You two pack your tennis rackets and go back where you belong. I'll do that all right. If she hadn't plugged you, I'd have done it myself. Come on, Babs. Oh, Gary, I'm so sorry! So sorry. - Sorry, nothing. I'm proud of you. Oh, Denny! Denny, does it hurt awful? Oh, stop blubbering. You've been using your head pretty well up to now. Get me the medicine kit. - Okay. Oh, Mr. Denny...Mr. Denny... Oh, shut up! Go heat some water. - Yes sir! - Medicine kit coming up. - That's more like it. Give me the iodine. Here now... Press that thing through there and pull it out the other end. You mean, push the bullet out or something? No, that bullet's 50 yards out in the compound. Come on, clean out that hole! - Oh, Denny! - Come on. One for the money... Two for... Two for the show. - Three to get ready... - Oh, Denny! Come on, hurry up, you sap! Four to...go. Come on, all the way through. It was something I overlooked. "And the next day, when the big round sun was high in the heaven, little Bobby Chipmunk could hardly believe his eyes, because there across Farmer Brown's meadows he saw little Molly Cottontail." A chipmunk and a rabbit! Say I wonder how this comes out. "But the faster he ran across the ground, the faster she went, hippity hop hippity hop..." Fred! Stop it! Sorry. Once more and you get the works right there! Can't you read anything but bedtime stories? I've read you everything four times. Except one certain item. - What? Well, I didn't want to upset you. You're not well yet, you know. - Let me see. - I'll read it. Where is it? Here: "Sailing for San Francisco on the Mohawa Maroo, was Mr. Gary Willis and his attractive wife of... Look how they spelled "Philadelphia"! "Ffil". Well anyway, let's see now. "Way across the meadow..." Come on Fred, shake out of it. "Way across the meadow, as old Daddy Sun was setting behind the purple hills, little Molly Cottontail went hippity hop, hippity hop..." Fred? What, Lily? You big cheese! Roquefort or gorgonzola? Me come again, peep peep! subs by ironhills and cinephage for KG
