And pick up else after school and bring her home. - Why can't she walk herself home ? - You know why. No arguments. Why are you and daddy always arguing with each other ? We're not. It's just that he thinks I'm still a kid. [ woman ] but I want the freshest. [ man ] don't worry. It's all we have. But look, it's-- here you are. [ else ] are you seeing Karin today ? We have economics together, and she's just a friend. I think it'd be nice if she was more than a friend. And why should I care what you think, hmm ? A little girl who has to be walked to school. I don't have to be. I can go by myself. Oh, fine then. Go by yourself. Hendrik ! Hendrik ! Are you following me ? Hendrik ! Ah, come on. You're a big girl. I'm sorry. You should not be running in a public square. He's my brother. He's walking me to school. No harm done. You wouldn't mind if I looked in your bag ? It's just books, sir. I'm a student at the university. Are you refusing to show it ? No. It's just that I've never been searched before. Things have changed. A saboteur was shot this morning. A university student. Maybe you know him. Why would I know him ? We are watching you students. Be cautious. That's what my father's always telling me. Listen to him. Go on. He said they were chest pains ? He described them as palpitations. Arrhythmic heartbeats. Your father's blood pressure has always been a little high, but he's never had heart trouble. I think it's this takeover by the Germans. It has us all on edge. I'm not hearing anything abnormal, Ben. How've you been sleeping ? Who can sleep ? Father worries that without the Danish government to protect us, we're at risk. They've been here three years. They're leaving you alone, aren't they ? Karl, you don't know. You're not a Jew. The Germans are arresting Jews all over Europe. Why should we be any different ? [ Karl ] I understand. But worrying about something that hasn't happened and might never happen... Isn't worth the price you're paying, Ben. Try to relax. Think about the good things in life, like Hannahs engagement to Michael. Oh, you and the family are coming to the engagement party, hmm ? I'm counting on it. We wouldn't miss it. Hello, Mr. Levy. Oh, Mrs. Koster. It's time you visited my shop. You neglect me. No. Karl has probably been wearing this jacket... With the hole under the arm for weeks before I saw it. "who's going to see it ?" he says. Oh, a doctor has a lot on his mind. And how have you been, Mr. Levy ? I'm all right, so long as I have work. Jorgen ! How are you, Hendrik ? I have to talk to you. A saboteur was shot this morning, a student. I heard. Was it someone we know ? No. But how did you find out ? I was searched this morning. He only spent a second going through my bag. But had he looked through everything, he would've found 20 of these anti-german leaflets. See, now you can't even walk down the streets. We have to call it off. We have to show them right away that we can resist. I'm saying we should wait. All right ? Next week. Next week, the guns will be in the barracks. It has to be today. Look, you just distract them. I'll get the trucks. [ Jorgen ] good. They're loading the guns into the trucks. Let's do it. [ whistle blowing ] [ yelling ] We're the resistance. We need these guns. We're taking them now. Move. Load up the back. You ! Take this. In the back. Move ! Load it. Load it. Come on, come on. Hurry ! Get out of here ! Come on ! Run ! [ grunts ] come on, Jorgen ! [ gunfire ] [ Hendrik ] get in ! Come on ! It's too late ! Let's go ! I got you. I got you. Go, go, go. Move ! [ chattering ] [ truck horn honking ] [ Karl ] you're going to recover nicely, lieutenant, But you'll have to endure our hospitality for a few days. I want to make sure there's no infection. Thank you, dr. Koster. And nurse, thank you. They're still people. No, they're not. He was wounded. We had to treat him. If I was hurt and sent to a german hospital, would they have to treat me ? Or would they be satisfied to ship one more Jew to a concentration camp ? Hannah, someday you will be married to Michael and have three beautiful children... And all of this will have been so long ago. [ door opens ] [ woman ] doctor. We have a second emergency. Another gunshot wound. He was left out back. Whoever brought him in didn't want to be seen. Well, he's lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover quickly. He's young. Under the new rules, we're required to report him to the Germans. Do we have to, dr. Koster ? The Germans don't have to hear about every perforated ulcer. And we don't have to give his real name. Captain. I trust your trip to Berlin was productive, general best. Very much so. It's not in the briefings yet, but there was... An attempted theft for weapons earlier today by the resistance. Arrests ? No, sir, but one of our men was shot. He's in hospital. Remind me to pay him a visit. Thank you, captain. The naval attach, Herr Duckwitz, is also waiting for you. Heil Hitler. So how was your trip to Berlin, Werner ? Well, I'm still here. It's not fair to blame you for the troubles here. The August uprising, the riots, the city strikes. I don't believe anyone ever used the word "fair" to describe Herr Hitler. But he has shown faith by retaining me as head of the occupying forces. I intend to prove his faith was not misplaced. I'm going to make it clear to the Danes who's in charge. You have a new plan of action ? Now that I've declared martial law, I'm imposing an earlier curfew and stricter rationing laws. Anyone found guilty of participating in the resistance will be sentenced to death. I've written a telegram to Herr Eichmann... Recommending that we begin deporting the Jews. These are aggressive measures, and they're certain to impress Berlin. But it could cause problems because there's a tradition of tolerance in Denmark, You know, especially towards the Jews. Georg, you lived in Denmark too long. Arresting the Jews is inevitable. I simply want the credit for it. I meant to tell you. In Berlin, I heard Beethovens ninth. I wish you'd been there. I know you love Beethoven. It was very moving. Let me guess. Potato pancakes ? No. - Boiled potatoes ? - No. I'm usually better at this. Chicken ! - I managed to find a chicken. - I wish I were as well connected as you are. Is ole in ? Please tell him to phone Karl as soon as he can. Is something wrong ? Else, why don't you go upstairs and tell Hendrik that supper's ready. Hendrik ! Supper's ready ! I said, "go." What is it ? I wouldn't trouble you with this. A german soldier was brought in today. He'd been shot. I treated him. But then there was another man who was also wounded. Someone left him out back. I'm pretty sure he's the man who shot the German. [ mother ] a resistance fighter ? What did you do ? I treated him. Then I changed his name and altered the records. You're chief surgeon. Couldn't someone else have dealt with it ? I was careful. You were not careful. No. This could come back on our whole family. [ Karl ] I just couldn't turn the fellow in. [ man on radio ] ...But he has resumed his supreme direction of fascism in Italy. Hendrik ! However, allied sources have indicated that Italy is sure-- I can hear it all the way downstairs. Nobody can hear it out on the street. It's a stupid risk. [ turns radio off ] If you listen to English news, you keep it down. You know, having this radio upsets your mother. The Germans are going to lose Italy. This is the beginning of the end for them. It could be years before it's all over. Yeah, but now is the time to put the pressure on. Now is the time to be patient. How can you say to do nothing now ? That's what everyone said when the Germans invaded in the first place. How could we fight them ? Any way you could. The young man I operated on today was just about your age. He might even go to the university. Do you ever wonder what our lives would be like... If it wasn't for the war ? Is the fellow all right ? The resistance fighter ? He'll be fine. [ Karl ] Hannah, Through the years our families have known each other, I've watched you grow into a beautiful young woman and a fine operating nurse. Now you are engaged to an intelligent young man with a bright future. Michael, I don't mind you taking Hannah away from her father, But don't get any ideas about taking her away from me. I'm going on far too long, as usual. In short, health and happiness. L'chaim ! L'chaim ! Mazeltov ! Mazeltov ! [ woman ] please, everybody, take a plate and help yourselves. [ chattering ] Dad. Is a Jewish wedding the same as a Christian wedding ? Oh, very different, else. I think you'll enjoy it. Life goes on, despite the war. You must not have heard what happened last night. The Jewish community centre was broken into. Records were taken. Lists of Jews. The Danish people wouldn't stand for it if the Germans started arresting Jews. They won't have a choice. Before, I've been able to tell people it will never happen here. But now it could. And soon. How far will they go ? As far as they can. Names, dr. Koster. Addresses. Thousands of them. Friends' names. Our names. General, as a minister of Denmark, This break-in is of great concern to me. But you are not a minister. You resigned along with the rest of your government... And forfeited the rule of Danish law. Lists of Jews were taken. That may have to do with the census one of our departments is compiling. With all due respect, general, this theft... Of lists of Jewish addresses... By the S.S. Leads me to only one conclusion. I'll have someone look into the matter. Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Andersen. Good day. There are two transport ships ready to sail from Hamburg whenever you need them. Have you thought when you might begin the arrests ? I'm rather pleased with myself. I had an inspiration. This Friday is Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year. Ah, yes, of course, the Jews will be at home to celebrate. We'll round them up in one mass operation. A surprise attack. Exactly. October the first. Midnight. The stroke of midnight. [ soldier ] links, links, links. Ah, Georg. I was getting worried. It's unlike you to be late. [ sighs ] what a beautiful day, huh ? [ inhales deeply ] on a day like this, one can almost forget the war. I'm afraid not. It's what you feared. How can we get word to people that fast ? Where can they go ? People will have to hide them. How long can they hide ? And when has it ever happened, people doing this for each other ? The only escape is Sweden... If Sweden will accept them. Even if they do take them, how are these people going to get across the water ? It's an impossible idea. It's the best chance we have. Take it step by step. We will try, of course. But do you think anyone will help ? The Germans have done what they wanted with us in every country they've invaded. No one has ever stopped them. My friends, there will be no service this morning. I have urgent news. Late last night, I received word of something we have feared, But felt could never happen in our beloved Denmark. Tomorrow night, at midnight, the Germans will begin mass arrests of Jews. [ congregation gasping ] anyone found at home on Rosh Hashanah... Will be taken. It's not true. I don't believe it. I-I-it's not possible. They have left us alone for three years. Why would they begin rounding up Jews now ? Believe me. You must not be at home Friday night. Ask your Christian friends to take you in. They will be generous. Tell everyone you know. Pass the word. If ever word needed to pass swiftly, it is this word. Go now. Go and be safe, my friends. I think we should take the Abrams in. Take them in ? Hide them... In the attic. Get them through the night. Save our friends. No. It's not that I-- You know I would do anything for the Abrams, Except put our family in danger. [ Karl ] last night, we talked about helping. We didn't talk about threatening the lives of our children. It's not just the Jews they're going to arrest. They're going to arrest anyone hiding Jews. No. I won't have the war coming into our home. It's already in the house. I've falsified the records, the radio is here. We can't keep it out. There must be some other thing we can do for them. [ Karl ] it's tomorrow night. Well, they are not coming here. I-- if they were arrested, their lives would be on our conscience. And if our children were taken away, Their lives would be on our conscience. Who comes first ? You tell me. Who are we bound to protect first ? How do we live with ourselves if we don't ? And what's the message we give our children ? I don't know... If I can do-- I don't know. Every Jew in Copenhagen is in danger. I've asked myself, "what can we do ? How can we help ?" I propose we hide people. [ Karl ] here. In the hospital. It might only be for one night, two nights, Until they can get up the coast and over to Sweden. I'm not going to pretend there isn't danger in this. We'd all be taking a big risk. It's something each of you must decide for themselves. But if we work together, I think we can do it. Why us ? Why should we take the chance ? Because we can. We have the space. We can use ambulances to move people. And we are in the business of saving lives. The first thing I can do... Is have my staff change the Jewish patients' names to Christian ones. Yeah. [ Hannah ] we have empty beds. - We can admit Jews as patients. - Are there any patients we can safely send home ? - I'll go through the charts. - What about the psychiatric hospital ? The Germans aren't likely to look there. They'd be afraid they'd catch something. We can hide them in the morgue as well. Also, in the nurse's quarters. The nurses can double up. Doctor, the S.S. Officer you operated on is in ward "b." we'll have to be careful. Let's find a more private room for lieutenant Schmidt. Everything must look like business as normal. I think my staff will not only want to do this, but would be ashamed not to. I think we all feel that way. If we can save 50 people, 100 people, It will be worth it. Hendrik, are you sure about this ? I heard my parents talking. We have to get the word out. Skip your classes. This is more important than any class. I'll go to the dean, get names of Jewish students. [ Hendrik ] good. My history professor is Jewish. He can tell the faculty. I pass by a Jewish butcher shop on the way to school. He'll know of other Jewish businesses. Tell our parents. They all have Jewish friends. That's the idea, all right ? One person will know dozens. Book sellers, shop keepers, policemen. The Danish police hate the Germans as much as we do. But be careful, all right ? - Tell only the people you can trust. - Does that include me ? [ chattering ] What are you doing out of the hospital ? I released myself. I'm all right. It's good to see you. It's good to see you too. You've heard ? I've heard. Well, tell me what you've planned. Your ships are on their way ? They should be docking at 4:00, about two hours from now. Major Langer, welcome to Copenhagen. It is an honor to be a part of such an important mission, general. This is Herr Duckwitz, our naval coordinator. Reichsmarshall Himmler has spoken very highly of you, major. He is most kind. Major, this operation is very dear to my heart. It must be flawless, and it will do honor to all of us. Please, children. Quiet. Before we take our lunch break, I would like David, Fran and Nathaniel to gather up your things. Your parents are here to take you home. [ children chattering ] You're not in trouble. There's a little emergency, and you will be better off with your families. They will explain. Don't be frightened. What do you think is wrong ? Is there some kind of flu going around ? Don't you see ? They're all Jews. I bet they're going away. My father says it's time the Germans did something about the problem. What problem ? They're our friends. I know. But they shouldn't be in the same school with us. That's what my mother says. That's a horrible thing to say. I don't see why they're any different from us. Hurry. [ Hannah ] quickly, quickly. Careful. Patient Sorensen. See nurse Hannah. She'll assign you to a bed. Hello. Mr. Sorensen. This is your bed. Nurse Petersen, how's it going ? I don't know what's in the air, but in the past 24 hours, There have been an awful lot of people needing our attention. Ward "a" is full, and this ward is filling up quickly. And how are you doing ? It sounds crazy, but I've never felt better in my life. It's a big house just outside the city. You'll be safe there. It's 27 Islegade at Vesterbro, all right ? It's the home of a friend's parent. He's already got three families. He won't mind another, okay ? Good luck. Thank you. Hendrik, what are you doing ? Why were you giving that lady an address ? Never mind, else. Was she a Jew ? What do you mean ? All the Jewish kids in school had to leave. Margareta said they're being taken away. What's happening ? Tomorrow night, the Germans are going to arrest all the Jews. Me and some of the other students are trying to find places for them to hide. You're in the resistance. No, it's too dangerous ! Else, I must do this. If you get caught, they might put you in jail. Else. Else, listen to me ! Look at me ! Don't tell father or mother you saw me here. Father would kill me. Promise. Don't get caught. Promise. I won't, all right ? Karl ? I asked the Abrams to stay. I think it will be all right. Do you know what's happening ? The Jews are being arrested. How do you know ? Three Jewish kids in school had to leave with their parents. There's people all over talking about hiding Jews. I saw them in the street. Are we hiding someone ? Is that why you're clearing the beds ? Friday night, rabbi Abrams and his family are staying with us. Isn't that against the law ? It's the right thing to do. You must tell no one. Do you understand ? [ Karl ] no one. Well, we can't put them in ward "b." it's full. Where can I find lieutenant Edgar Schmidt ? General best is here to see him. General. Lieutenant Schmidt. The fuehrer wishes to reward you for your bravery. Dr. Koster, there's a German general visiting lieutenant Schmidt. Where are they ? Ward "d." I'm coming. Spread the word. Everything must seem normal. Get these people into bed... Or hide them. General, I'm dr. Karl Koster, Chief surgeon of Christiana hospital. Welcome. Dr. Koster, I've heard of the good work you do here. We do everything we can. Wait here. You can't go that way. [ murmuring ] Where did these people come from ? They can't come in here now. You've certainly taken good care of our man Schmidt. Well, we're looking forward to sending him on his way. Dr. Koster himself actually operated on me. Warn dr. Koster. Hurry. I'm very sorry. You cannot come in here. Doctor, we have an emergency. A truck just dropped off 40 people. We have nowhere to hide them. General, before you go, I hope you'll take a moment to see the rest of the hospital. Our therapy room, the new x-ray unit. We're very proud of them. I'll be with you in a moment. Put them in the chapel. We have to get them in the chapel. [ chanting ] Come on. Please, get in. [ chanting continues ] General, I'm sorry. We have these little crises from time to time. I'm sorry to interrupt this service. We have an emergency in the hospital. I'll see what I can do to help you, doctor. I appreciate it. I'd like to look around your hospital... At a more convenient time. Oh, I'm at your service. I need some more, please. Thank you. Please, put these on. I must be on my way. These are busy days. Busy days for all of us. Pastor, we're ready. And that concludes the singing of the hymns. Now let us pray. The 23rd psalm. [ congregation ] "the lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. "he maketh me to lie down in green pastures. "he leadeth me beside still waters. Popular man. "he restoreth my soul. "he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. "yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of the death, I will fear no evil." Is there anything anyone needs ? Doris, we're fine. Please, don't worry about us. Well, else and I are just about to run out to do some shopping. I'm sorry to have to leave you when you've all just arrived. I should apologize. I feel terrible, you having to shop for us, wait on us. No, you mustn't think that way. No, please, just get settled. I-- I'll be back soon. Hannah, you and Michael take the other side. Are you sure, rabbi Abrams ? I'm sure. They're not married. Being together always comforted us when there was trouble. Shouldn't they have the chance to comfort each other now ? Men ! Time is of the essence. Make the arrests quickly and cleanly. If you have to use force, use it, but take them alive. A dead Jew is no good to me. I want a line 7,500 long, marching into Theresienstadt concentration camp. Our fuehrer gave us our credo: Thy honor is thy loyalty. Prove it tonight, men. Prove your honor. Mr. Levy ? [ bell dings ] Good. He is gone. Well, let's look for daddy's jacket. Ah, this is it. I don't-- I-- I can pay him later, I suppose. Look, there's a note. "this is no longer my world. Shalom. Isaac levy." W-what is he-- [ screams ] [ else sobbing ] Mother, what's wrong ? Mr. Levy, he's killed himself. I'll, uh-- I'll put these things away. Oh, the Abrams are staying with us tonight. I understand. [ drill leader ] company ! [ soldiers shout, indistinct ] I hope all this goes as smoothly as you planned. It'll be like lightning. There won't be time for one Jew to warn another... Or for a single Jew to escape. A whirlwind that sweeps them into our hands. The surprise is the key, Georg. The surprise is everything. [ rabbi Abrams ] thank you, Ruth. [ Doris ] everyone, please, sit down. Is this correct ? You dip the fruit in the honey to show the sweetness of the new year. I studied your religion at school. And I have studied yours. I was hungry, and you gave me meat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in. What happens now, Ben ? Let me say a few words of prayer. May it be your will, god, To grant us a year of goodness and blessing, Life and peace. Blessed are you, our god, ruler of the universe, Who has given us life, sustained us... And brought us to this season. May our names, All our names, Be inscribed in the book of life. - Amen. - Amen. Excuse me. Sorry. Was it just a few days ago we had the party ? Life changes so fast. I've had this ever since I was a child. It has always protected me. Now it will protect us both. [ dog barking in distance ] Search every house. Find every Jew. [ barking continues ] [ whistling ] Get out of bed ! Get up ! [ soldiers shouting ] open up ! This is empty, too, sir ! Keep looking ! Move, move, move ! Look everywhere ! Empty ! Old man, you are coming with us. No, my friend. You are coming with me. [ machine-gun fire ] No one here ! [ door opens ] I have the first reports back from the squad, sir. How many have been arrested ? It's been three hours. There must be thousands. Two hundred and two. Is this a joke ? Of those, 18 were suicides, 39 were bedridden. All you've arrested are cripples and corpses ? The Jews, it seems, have disappeared. Seventy-five hundred people have disappeared ? I led many of the raids myself. I found not one person in a Jewish household. They were all gone. Georg, I've already sent a telegram to Hitler reporting our complete success. The Jews must be somewhere, Werner. They can't simply have disappeared. I want roadblocks on every street leading out of the city. I want spot searches of houses. Search every house if you have to. Georg, blockade the harbor. Not a ship leaves without being inspected. Of course. Anyone hiding a Jew will be arrested. Anyone denying they're hiding a Jew who's lying will be shot. Raid the university. Send dogs into the woods. Break down the doors of the churches. Yes, they're here. Someone tipped them off, and they're hiding. A very neat little trick. I congratulate them. But they won't escape. I'll make that impossible. The only way the Jews are getting out of Copenhagen is on my ships. [ pounding ] [ pounding continues ] Every house is being searched. Who is at home ? My wife, daughter, son. Searched for what reason ? If you are hiding Jews, you will be arrested. Why would we be hiding Jews ? [ snaps riding crop ] show me the upstairs. Quickly ! It's just our family living here, as you can see. [ gasping ] Where does this lead to ? It's just a linen closet. [ doorknob rattling ] Why is it locked ? We-- we keep our-- our valuables in there. There are-- have been many robberies in the neighborhood. - Open it up. - I don't have the key. I would have to find it. Then find it ! Or would you prefer my men to break the door down ? Dr. Koster ? Lieutenant Schmidt ! How is that arm of yours ? Giving you any trouble ? [ Schmidt ] none at all, doctor. I'm back on duty. Ah, lieutenant, things are as you see. - Major, if I may ? - Yes, lieutenant. I think there's no need to worry about this house. I'm sure it's clean. Why ? You know this man ? Yes, sir. He operated on me recently. I'm very grateful to him. Sorry to have disturbed you. Doctor, Mrs. Koster. Let's go. Mama. Shh. [ sighs ] I'm sorry. I suppose I thought they won't search my house. I don't think you have anything to apologize for. [ chair scraping floor ] - Hendrik, you're not going out. - I have work to do, a paper that's late... And a test on Monday. Oh, no. Karl, tell him. Mom, we can't let them run our lives. That's what they want. The last thing I intend to do is give them what they want. Bye. How long can the Abrams stay here ? The Germans may not come back today, but what about tomorrow ? I could take them to the hospital. But moving them right now is taking a risk. No, I suppose, for the moment, they're safest here. I've been thinking. If the Germans search the hospital, We need to talk about what would happen if you-- Doris, if I get caught, don't wait to see what happens. Take the children and go to the coast house. There, you can find someone to take you to Sweden. And if something should happen to me, Promise me you'll think of the children first. The children will be safe first. I need to know that. Yeah. I promise. Who tipped them off ? Who could be so disloyal ? It's unconscionable. I'll find him, and he'll be shot. As you requested, I've asked for five more e-boats to patrol the sound, But unfortunately, they might not be here for a few more days. I want them by tomorrow. The resistance must not succeed. I'm doing everything I can, Werner. I'll close off the escape route to Sweden. I'll block roads to the coast. I want those boats now ! We've got to start getting people out of here and up the coast. Have you heard anything from Sweden ? My contact is still working on it, but so far, nothing. We have no choice. We have to act as if they'll take the Jews. You do know, the Germans have impounded all Danish vessels. Except fishing boats. If we can get people to these little fishing ports, Maybe we can find fishermen to take them across the sound. I have a house in Horsholm. We could use it as our base of operations. But how do you get them to Horsholm ? There are roadblocks everywhere. Ambulances. Hendrik, we've alerted the people. We've got safe houses. Don't be so hard on yourself. We can do this too. [ phone ringing ] Hello ? I found a warehouse where we can take people. Great. I owe you a beer when this is all over. All right. - I got a truck ! - Good. Conroy's got petrol ration cards. I heard people are running into the woods and hiding there. All right, let's go. Come on ! [ speaking German ] [ dogs barking ] Anybody you find hiding, take them to the pickup places we talked about. Go ! [ man ] all right. [ Hendrik ] make sure they know they're not safe here. Hurry. There. The Germans are coming ! Get your things ! There's a truck waiting for you half a mile through the path, off the road. A student will call to you. Hurry ! Don't worry. You can trust us. Please, do as I say. Gather up your belongings. Quickly. Hurry. We don't have much time. [ dog barking ] Shh. Quiet. Hurry ! Quickly ! That's it. We don't have much time. - [ Hendrik ] they're coming. - Let's get out of here. The dogs will follow our trail. We're gonna have to stall them. Take the refugees to the truck. We'll meet you there as soon as we can. Are you sure ? Pick us up on the side road. Go on. Come on, come on. Let's go. This way. [ dogs barking ] no. Take off your jacket. [ chattering in German ] If the Gestapo on your tail can't make you kiss me, what will ? [ chattering, barking grow louder ] On your feet. Up. All Jews are under arrest. Jews ? You think we look Jewish ? Here. Check our papers. [ Jorgen ] get going. Have you seen anyone hiding in the woods ? We've been a little too busy to notice. Come ! Are we going to the warehouse ? Can't. Roadblocks. It's all right. I have a better idea. Did you have enough to eat ? I have more bread. There's no butter today, but-- It was plenty. Thank you, Doris. Oh, it helps to keep busy. It keeps me from thinking too much, you know ? You will think less of me for this, But I didn't want you to come here. I was afraid of what would happen. Well, I-- I just wanted to be-- I wanted to apologize for not being the one to ask you here. How many people can you take at one time ? On my boat ? Twenty will be a tight squeeze. I can't have anybody on deck. What about German patrol boats ? Ah, they go pretty much to schedule. The trick for us is to make the run as soon as they go by. Stig, how are the fish running for you this morning ? A bit slow for me, Arne. He's one of the men we have to count on. What will it cost ? Two thousand kroner a trip. Two thousand ? That's as much as a trip to America. But doctor, if the men are caught, they will lose their boats, Maybe even their lives. How can I raise that much ? We have thousands of people. Some of them don't have any money at all. Oh, well, the people up here, they are not very rich either. What about collaborators ? Oh, everyone up here hates the Germans, But you know, there's always one or two crazies. We can't let that stop us. We just go ahead. How long before the Germans are on the coast ? They're there already. People were caught yesterday. [ brakes squealing ] Shh. You must be very still. [ door opening ] [ footsteps ] [ footsteps approaching ] Dad ! What are you doing here ? What are you ? How long have you been involved in this ? Why didn't you tell me ? You wouldn't have let me out of the house. I should wring your neck. But I'm too proud of you. [ Hendrik ] one night we were listening to the radio. We couldn't talk, like always. That day I'd been with Jorgen when he got shot. I was the one who brought him to the hospital. I wanted to tell you. But you didn't trust me. We haven't had a whole lot in common lately. Hendrik, I want you to get through this war alive. Dad... Nothing I have ever done has felt so right. Well... It looks like we're talking again. How will I explain this to your mother ? I told her I'm staying at the university. [ Karl ] today the banks are closed, but tomorrow, first thing. We need it as fast as we can. Thanks. Hendrik phoned. He's going to be staying at the university for the next few days. He said not to worry. It's going to take a lot of money to get these people to Sweden, If Sweden will actually take them. If this doesn't work, I don't know what we're going to do. Else and I are going to the pastor. We will ask the pastor to take up a collection. You're going out ? Our son is right. We can't let the Germans tell us what to do. Let me help you. Yes, thank you. Hurry up ! - Hurry ! - [ man ] this way. Come on. Let's go. - [ man ] quickly ! - Run ! That's it, that's it. Get in the boat. [ Hendrik ] come on. Come on ! Push, push. [ crowd muttering ] [ man ] papers are necessary. Papers, papers. Have papers ready. Move. Papers. I know what your husband is doing. He saved my life once. It is time to pay him back. Papers. Roadblock. There's never been a roadblock on this road before. Turn around. It's too late. They've seen us. Money. Money. [ brakes squeal ] Where are you going ? Uh, Hillerod. We're working on a house up there. Papers. Clear to pass. Open the back. We were cleared. Get out. Open it. Open it. Ah. Jews. [ grunting ] - [ gun fires ] - [ people shouting ] Dr. Koster. Success ? I've been to the bank. And here ? I'll be with you in a minute. We're working all night. Hannah, are you still here ? You shouldn't be here. You should be in hiding. I can't let everyone else do the work. I have to help. How many have made it up the coast so far? It's hard to say. Hundreds. Karl. Ole. The Swedes have made a decision. They will admit the Jews. All Danish Jews are welcome. This is great news ! [ laughing ] I don't know how you did it. I had a friend. [ nurse Petersen laughing ] This is a good omen. For the first time I feel this just might work. - It's Hendrik. - He was arrested... Outside of Bikerod. We used the same road yesterday and there was no roadblock. Where will they take him ? To the local police station... Until the Gestapo take him in for questioning. Let's go. Look, they'll arrest you if you try to bribe them. It's the only way. [ both laughing ] Officers, I need your help. I'm going to appeal to your pride as Danish citizens. You have my son as a prisoner here for the Germans. I want you to let him go. It's too late. They know his name and address. Gestapo are on their way. Why should we help you ? Let him go. I'll make it worth your while. You're concerned about what might happen to you if you let him go. I understand. But this is my son. They might kill him. He's 18 years old. Put your money away, doctor. Hold it ! Don't move or I'll shoot. [ pants ] I have other men coming. You would be wise to give yourself up. I've never been very wise. Go ! I'll cover you ! [ indistinct shouts ] Jorgen ! Come on ! [ groans ] [ machine-gun fire continues ] Dr. Koster, what's wrong with Hendrik ? He's hurt ! I need some help getting him into the house ! Hurry ! Quick ! Please help him. Sit up, Hendrik. Take his arms. Gently, now. Yes. Straight out. This will hurt. [ groaning ] sorry. You will have to be my nurse, Karin. Wash your hands. I shouldn't have let you do this. I should have locked you in a room. It wouldn't have done any good. This won't be enough to kill the pain... But I'll do my best. I trust you, dad. I love you, son. [ sniffles ] W-we can take care of anything until you come back. No, get rid of it all, so there's not a trace that we were here. There's just a few things it pains me to part with. Pictures. This bible, over 100 years old. This menorah has been in my family for generations. It was my grandfather's; My father's. Ben, please. Let us take care of them. I'll take them and hide them somewhere safe. I know just where. Could you ? [ bell tolling ] [ knocking ] It's very beautiful, isn't it ? You were right to bring it here. I'll keep it safe until the Abrams return. You're a very brave girl. You're going to be fine. Jorgen is dead. I know. He died trying to save me. He died because he believed in something with all his heart. It isn't right that anybody should die, But Jorgen wouldn't want you to blame yourself. He'd want you to be proud that you took part in saving so many lives. [ weeping ] We have to get him to Sweden. He needs a hospital. Well, if it's urgent, I'll take him in my boat-- now. [ sloshing sound ] - All right, son ? - I'm all right. [ Stig ] you will stink, but you will be in Sweden. [ phone ringing ] Hello ? [ Karl ] Doris ? Yes ? I think he'll be all right. - A friend will see him to the hospital. - [ relieved sigh ] Thank god. I-I hardly slept at all last night. I-- I've been so worried about him. It's time for us all to go. I'm coming for you this afternoon. No, no, you mustn't come here. Meet me. 5:00. Don't say where. Give me a hint. I will know. Where we began our life together. Yes. Right. And wear the scarf I love so. I love you. I love you. [ whispering ] oh, be careful. How did he escape ? [ Langer ] the Danish police are collaborating with the resistance. Who is the man those oafs managed to kill ? Jorgen Christiansen, a student at the university. And the one who got away ? Hendrik Koster, also a student. Father, dr. Karl Koster, chief surgeon of Christiana hospital. The hospital ? They were hiding Jews under my nose ? We need to pay another visit to the hospital. [ all chattering ] [ man ] quickly now ! Where can we find dr. Koster ? I-I'll see if he's in. Don't bother. We'll see for ourselves. Make haste ! Aha. General. - [ Hannah ] Michael. - Good-bye. [ Ruth ] thank you. [ Hannah ] bye, else. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Be careful. [ engine sputters, truck departs ] [ group chattering ] Give me that. [ baby crying ] careful now. It's a mild sedative. It won't harm her. She'll just be quiet during the trip. We can never thank you enough. There's nothing to thank me for. We'll see each other soon. Good-bye, Ruth. Good-bye. - Hey, I'm afraid that's all I can take now. - Hannah, Hannah, take my place. [ Abrams ] yes, you and Michael. There's not time. Go, mom, dad. - Hurry. I'll see you soon. - There may be room in Arne's boat. [ engine cranking ] Arne, have you got room for two more ? Come on. But I'm having trouble with my engine. - What's wrong ? - Keeps cutting out. - We've got to get these people off this pier. - I'm trying. Michael ! The chain you gave me with the star of David-- it's not here ! It doesn't matter. Well, I never take it off ! It must've broken ! Don't worry about it. You're shaking. [ cranking continues ] - [ Stig ] ah, let me take a look. - [ Arne ] go on, Stig. - I'll follow you as soon as I can. - Just let me have a try, huh ? Mind. Hey ! You cut the fuel line ! Germans ! You traitor ! [ indistinct shouting ] You sabotaged your own boat ! [ grunting ] [ people shouting, screaming ] Come on ! All up ! Onto my boat, all of you ! Can you take them ? I will have to take them ! [ shouting, screaming continues ] Uuh ! [ Stig ] keep your hands and arms and heads down. Come on ! Come on, come on, come on. Over here ! Come on ! Come, come with me ! Aah ! Come on ! Come on. Keep down. Down ! [ indistinct shouting ] Take care, doctor. [ man #1 ] move ! Let's go ! [ man #2 ] take his gun ! Four hundred. Four hundred Jews out of thousands. How did it go wrong ? Well, it was a perfect plan. It should have played out brilliantly. You warned me against it at the start. Why ? Because I knew that it would enrage the Danish people and cause you trouble. You've lived in Denmark a long time, Georg. Perhaps you let that influence your good judgment. Perhaps it was you who tipped off the Jews ! I'm proud to call myself your friend, Werner. I would never do that to you. It wasn't me. Forgive me. Georg. Forgive me for doubting you. Else! Hurry ! It's almost quarter past 4:00. [ else ] just one more minute. Don't take too much. We don't want to look conspicuous. [ knocking ] [ knocking ] Mrs. Koster. Would dr. Koster be at home ? No, he's not. Huh. Where might I find him ? He's at-- at the hospital, I assume. He is not at the hospital. Some days he's around the town. He's on many committees and he-- Why are you-- why are you searching my house again ? I ask the questions, Mrs. Koster. Where is your son Hendrik ? He's at the university, in class. You're hiding Jews in this house. No, we are not. I told you that before. You said this was a linen closet. I-I was nervous. Y-you came so early that morning. You-you got us out of our beds. [ cracking ] else, come here. Else can show me the way up the stairs. - This is where you hid them, didn't you ? - No. No, you're wrong. We didn't hide anyone. You Danes think you're very clever, don't you ? Ah, Mrs. Koster. When you do speak to your husband, tell him to pay us a visit at headquarters. We have a few questions. [ engine starting ] [ Doris ] else, I want you to do this. When I let go of your hand, go straight to the church... And run up the steps. - Daddy will be waiting. Do you understand ? - When are you coming ? Go straight to your father. Go now. Don't look back. Where's your mother ? [ engine revs ] Mrs. Koster. Come with me. We have some questions for you at Gestapo headquarters. [ crying ] She isn't coming. Oh. [ sniffs ] You know, doctor, you have done an incredible thing. What have I done ? I did all this and I couldn't save Doris. I made her a promise. But she is very strong. I think she will be all right. I want these matters dealt with immediately, captain. I will take care of it personally. [ clicks heels ] [ door opens ] major Langer. - The fuehrer has sent Adolf Eichmann to see you. - I'm honored. I do not believe he has come to honor you, general. I promised to purge Denmark of Jews. And it is purged. You can confirm this to him. Herr Eichmann has not come to see me, general. He is waiting... And he is not a patient man. [ sighs ] Today, one of the bravest men in Denmark is a German... And a member of the Nazi party. You risked your life by warning the Jews, And then again by persuading Sweden to take them. Why ? I came to this country as a young man... Ambitious and a little homesick as young men are. The Danes welcomed me, and some of them were Jews. It's easy to persecute the nameless and the faceless, But these people are not faceless to me. I-- I could've walked away, but-- You know, a-- A man must live with himself a long time, And if he can do something to ease a little... The terrible ache in this world, He must. I love Denmark. It's my home now. And when your home is on fire, you want to save it. That's all it was. My home was on fire. [ Karl ] the next five weeks weren't easy for us. Hendrik began to heal and else was safe, But the Germans still held Doris. Then just before Christmas they released her, and we began to breathe again. I wasn't to see her until the war ended in 1945, Two long years later. In just a few weeks, over 7,000 Jews had been hidden and transported to Sweden. Only 464 were captured. The majority of those survived. When they returned to Denmark, all who had fled... Found their homes and businesses had been watched by friends and neighbors, Their pets cared for, their gardens tended. In every language and religion, to be humane is to love your neighbor. People have said the Danes showed enormous courage in their time. Else ! But I think we all felt we only did what was normal. In a time when the world was lost in madness, We were lucky to escape it.
