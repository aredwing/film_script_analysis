I spent two years and $3 billion mining outer space... ...and this green grain of rice is all I have to show for it? It's a pretty green. Unless I have enough of it to make Superman's head explode, Mercy, my dear... ...it's not the kind of green that interests me. LexCorp bleeds millions every time the Man of Steel... ...thwarts my covert plans to achieve world domination. What does he have against free enterprise, anyway? And every day that Superman's popularity spikes... ...mine drops another rung down the sewers of Metropolis. Well, I think you're amazing, Mr. Luthor. I pay you to think I'm amazing, Mercy. But market research shows it doesn't matter... ...how much money Lex Luthor pumps into this economy. People only respond to amazing heroes. So today, LexCorp unveils a new breed of hero. Up, up, and away above Metropolis, to defend our city, our world... ...against wayward meteors and alien threats. The Lex 9000: Because even Superman can't patrol Earth's orbit 24/7. The LX7 supercomputer indicates the bogey may be space debris. That debris just hung a hard right toward Earth. Let's put Lex 9000 to the test. Velocity is off the charts. Impact in-- I know the when, just give me the where. Here. It's heading straight for us. Let's get out of here. Data. Billions of bit streams. I think I shall help myself. Brainiac just hijacked Lexlabs. If he's gonna cripple Metropolis by crashing all our computers like last time... ...whose front page am I gonna read it on first? I'm on it, chief. Just need to make a pit stop. But my hands are still wet, Ms. Lane. Dry them on your socks and grab your camera, Jimmy. If Kent beats us to another scoop, I've officially lost my mojo. Buckle up. Mr. Luthor, sir. Brainiac just crash-landed at Lexlabs. But Lex 9000.... Shall I fetch the limo? It's time to log off. But I hunger for knowledge, son of Krypton. And knowledge is power. You may want to attend to that. He's going the other way, Ms. Lane. What are we gonna do? Get another angle on things. Why can't you be more like Kent? He never whines. Heck, half the time, I don't even know he's here. You better get the fear. Be a real newsman, or there's the door. Ms. Lane, you know something bad's gonna happen. Why do you always have to put yourself in these situations? He's why, Jimmy. Upload complete. Another small step in my evolution toward becoming the ultimate intellect. And information is most valuable if I am the only one who possesses it. Were the only one. Nice try, son of Krypton... ...but I am now equipped to go one better. It may not be kryptonite... ...but its power cannot be denied. I am so happy. No, wait. -I'm sad. -Sir? Lex 9000 is supposed to bust up meteors, not Superman. News of this could ruin me. Well, can't beat ringside. Mercy, microwave some popcorn. Oh, boy. Ms. Lane! Help! Help! How ironic. Brought to your knees by a device... ...intended to drive the likes of me away. With you deleted, son of Krypton... ...nothing can stop me from draining your planet dry of all its data. I think I shall enjoy hurtling humankind back to the Dark Ages. Brain freeze. Ms. Lane, you really need to be more careful. You always catch me when I fall, Superman. Besides, how else am I supposed to get to know you better? Brainiac and Lex 9000 made quite a team. They were yay close to offing the big, blue boy scout. Until Superman brained Brainiac. Or did he? Please, please, shoot my good side. Didn't know you had one. Touch, Lane. Welcome, Superman. I'd offer you a latte, but Brainiac seems to have busted up our refreshment station. Mr. Luthor, care to comment about the operation of your so-called meteor buster? Hey, I just build the stuff. How intergalactic scum choose to use it is another matter. Isn't that right, Superman? If it had done its job and shot down Brainiac in the first place... ...we wouldn't be having this conversation. New technology always requires fine-tuning. But the real question is, who's gonna pay for this mess? Thanks to you, Superman, Brainiac's in no condition to cut me a check. Nope, no signs of life here. Kent, you're one heck of a journalist, maybe my best. You meet deadlines without breaking a sweat... ...and without putting yourself in harm's way like Lane. I'm not sure how you pull it off. Well, guess I just keep my eye on the story and my fingers on the typewriter keys. Kent, I wish you'd reconsider my offer to be our foreign correspondent. Branch out. It's the Daily Planet, after all. Oh, I don't know, Mr. White. I'd hate being so far away from home base, from the gang. What are you, in kindergarten? I suggest you worry about being far from home when you decide to settle down. -Mercy. -Nice collection you got there, Jimmy. Which do you recommend I use for my story? This one's my favorite. Get over her, Jimmy. She'd eat you alive. Sarah's really more your speed. Sarah? That geek? We don't have anything in common. You both work for the newspaper. -She's the food critic. -Free meals. You'd never have to pick up the check. I like cheeseburgers and chili fries. She likes chichi. It's her job to like chichi. You know what they say, Jimmy: Beauty isn't skin-deep. Look who's talking, Miss Only Has Eyes For Superman. I won't deny there's something about a flying man in tights that gets me tingly... ...but when you look into someone's eyes and get that connected feeling... ...like somehow you've always known them... ...that's when you know it's right. So, Jimmy, get past the glasses, huh? Hey, someone mention chili fries? Yeah, about four hours ago. Well, you two have fun. I have a Superman story to finish. Check out my snaps, Mr. K. Mercy may work for the dark side... ...but I think that just adds to her dangerous allure. I wouldn't know, Jimmy. She's not exactly my type. Hello, anyone home? What? Where am I? I was hoping his first words would be " Dada." Where are you? And Lex Luthor gave him sight. -Lex Luthor? -In the flesh. -I know of you through my-- -Acquisition of knowledge... ...through my patented Lexlabs supercomputer.... Your tone conveys a familiarity that has not yet been earned, Lex Luthor. You know, it's just that kind of braggadocio... ...that got you brained to bits in the first place. By the son of Krypton, yes. I'm feeling the love here. Are you? Brainy, babe, you and I are both muy simpatico. We're both into the world-domination thing... ...and we both despise the superpowered boy scout of Metropolis. If you have a point, make it. I can provide you with the ultimate opportunity... -...to annihilate Superman. -And in return? You allow me to publicly avenge the Man of Steel. Put on a big show, playing hero, chase you from Earth. Then you take over some other world far away... ...and leave the domination of this one to me. -We both live happily ever after. -The end. We make strange allies, Lex Luthor. But giving up Earth is small sacrifice for ridding the galaxies of my mortal enemy. Let's rebuild you, partner. I am a biotechnic entity. All that I require is proximity to technology... ...to incorporate into my very being. Hey, I didn't mean to step on any proverbial toes. But if that's the case... ...I suggest that we incorporate you... ...with something other than a toaster oven this time. Something with a little more... ...muscle. Clark, is something troubling you? You hardly touched your chicken and dumplings. Yeah, you usually have at least six helpings. I'm watching my carbs, Mom. Well, we're sure glad you flew home for the weekend, son. Since you've been in Metropolis, we barely see you. Figured it was work keeping you busy. Or a lady. -Any thoughts about settling down? -On Earth? Oh, I'm here to stay. Lois has been on my mind. Again. How are things, you know, going with her? As Superman? Dandy. But she can't seem to look Clark Kent in the eye. Well, maybe it's the spectacles. Ever consider getting that new-fangled laser surgery? He doesn't need glasses. Right, right, x-ray vision. I knew that. Look, Lois is a crack reporter. Best there is. It's only a matter of time before she gets past the glasses... ...sees through my disguise. I'm concerned she won't ever trust me... ...or Superman again. I need to tell Lois the truth. So, what's keeping you, Clark? You got our support. I have powerful enemies who would give anything to find my weak spot. If any one of them were to discover what Lois might learn... ...that Clark Kent is Superman.... Well, I can't knowingly put Lois... ...put anyone I care about, in that kind of danger. Son, we know you're Superman, and we're just fine. Clark, if there's one thing we've learned since being blessed with you... ...a risk is worth taking if it's for love. Since you've already hijacked Lex 9000 once on your own... ...I have an automatic alibi. You just build the stuff. Enough dallying. My biotechnic-grafting process requires an incubation period. Hold your horses, Brainy. We have a couple of extras for your travel kit. One: Kryptonite. A smidgeon, but who knows? Combined with your new firepower... ...it might be just enough to kick things up a notch. And second? We took a swab off your shiny little dome... ...and guess what turned up. Your IQ. Seems Super-Duperman clocked you so hard... ...he left a little something for you to remember him by. A strand of DNA. With the Kryptonian's DNA, I can lock on to his energy signature... ...track him wherever he may be. That's right, partner. Superman may run faster than a speeding bullet... ...but he can't hide. See you at Superman's funeral. Night. See you in the a.m. Not so fast. Kent, need you to cover for Sarah tonight. She just called in sick. Lovesick. No, ate some bad clams. You'll be reviewing Lamont Laboe's new hot spot. Trs chichi. But, Perry, I don't know the first thing about how to-- Lane, the reservation's for two. Help the man out. Hungry? Once again, I am reborn. -I didn't know it was gonna be so.... -Dark? Welcome to Le Chateau Laboe... ...the most romantic dining experience in Metropolis. Are we celebrating an anniversary tonight? Honeymooning? Dating. -Actually, we're.... -Critics. So let's keep things professional, huh? I love to dine surrounded by beauty. After I make a show of mopping up Brainiac with one of my patented Lexosuits... ...l'll be the new boy scout of Metropolis. And the military will finally beg to pay you top dollar for them. You're learning, Mercy. Now, parmesan, por favor. Sir, mission control has lost all contact with Lex 9000. It vanished. It's showtime. Well, no, no, I'm sure.... Calamari not your thing, Smallville? I'm 1 00 percent corn-fed. If it's not Mom's chicken and dumplings.... Well, I'm glad there's squid on the table. My pen just ran out of ink. You know, Lois, I never pegged you for such a romantic. I mean, with Jimmy. Playing matchmaker and all. I just hate seeing people miss opportunities. Life's too short, you know what I mean? I think I'm starting to. So I meddle in Olsen's affairs. What's your story, Kent? Seeing anyone? I'm waiting for a special someone to take notice of me. Kent, why so mild-mannered? You shouldn't be afraid to tell a girl what's on your mind. I mean, you're kind, intelligent... ...good-looking, well-built.... What is it, Lois? For a moment, you... ...reminded me of someone I know, that's all. Lois, this is hard for me. Maybe harder than anything I've ever had to say. But there's something I need to tell you. Son of Krypton. Yes, Clark? You have something right here. -Son of Krypton. -I'm here, Brainiac. Clark? Clark? I have been keeping pace with current trends in technology. And I have upgraded with one goal in mind: Your destruction. Chief, trust me. This is one restaurant review... ...you'll want plastered on the front page. All I need is my ace photographer. Hey, wait a sec. Technology. Enemy engaged. You cannot hide from me, son of Krypton. The more I try to resist him, the weaker I become. This time, son of Krypton, I possess brawn as well as brain. Oh, no. Ms. Lane. Lois. Lois. Superman, I... ...should be more careful. We're doing everything we can to keep her comfortable. She can be comfortable at home, doc. What's her condition? We're still running tests, but... ...her blood cells seem to be fusing... ...with traces of metal alloy. As if she's being galvanized from the inside out. We've called in specialists, but... ...if Ms. Lane's blood continues to mutate at this rate... ...she hasn't much time. Superman. He didn't save her this time, Mr. Kent. Superman didn't save her. I need to go away for a while, Jimmy. But I promise you... ...Superman will do everything in his power to save Lois. Was quite a slugfest at the new fondue joint last night. But I'm not sure which I find more tragic: Superman's corpse failing to turn up in the rubble... ...or Lane's little mishap. Maybe she'll think twice next time she decides to snoop in your business. If there's a next time. Mercy, send flowers. We could use the PR. Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-EI. Lois has been harmed, and it's my fault. Brainiac knew I was at the restaurant. Which means he's either discovered my identity... ...or a way of tracking me. Then I must question the wisdom in your coming here, Kal-EI. All of Krypton's secrets could be compromised. I need to save Lois. Nothing else matters. And this is the one time neither my speed nor my strength can help her. My analysis of Ms. Lane's condition is complete. Most curiously, I have detected a faint trace of kryptonite in her bloodstream. That would explain my weakness. Ms. Lane is suffering from a highly concentrated form of blood-alloy fusion. What will it take to cure her? There is no earthly cure. -There does exist a rare substance. -Where do I find it? Only one place. The Phantom Zone. I must go there. I had expected that, Kal-EI. But listen carefully. Though the Phantom Zone is prison... ...to the most dangerous criminals in all the galaxies... ...they will not present the greatest threat to you within it. I'm prepared to fend off any of its attacks. Once inside, remain intently focused... ...and above all, accomplish your mission swiftly. For the longer you remain in the Zone... ...the more vulnerable you will be to its effects... ...and the more difficult it will become for you to find your way back. The substance which you seek lies at the heart of the Phantom Zone. Argonium 44. Be sure to obtain enough of it. As well as cure Ms. Lane... ...Argonium 44 may also serve to shield you... ...from Brainiac's form of modified kryptonite. You cannot hide from me. So this is your sanctuary. Data. Kryptonian data. The mother lode. Billions of bits... ...from the great minds of the extinct planet Krypton. I shall drain it dry. The computer only responds to my DNA. Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-EI. Yes, it does. This ends here, with us. DNA recognition override. Self-destruct mode commenced. Twelve, 1 1... No, you would not. All the knowledge of your civilization, lost? Better lost than abused. -...four, three, two, one. -No! No energy signature. At least, the son of Krypton is no more. I got one heck of a case of food poisoning. Last time I eat out with Clark. Where is Clark? Mercy, it's beginning to feel like somewhere in the world... ...Superman may be history. Break out the tiki torches. We're throwing a luau. And be sure to invite all our favorite members of the press. So here I work on Kent for a year to be my foreign correspondent... ...and he picks now to take the job. Then I don't hear boo from him... ...and for the first time ever, he misses a deadline. Still can't reach him. Maybe his cell can't roam in Uzbekistan. I can't figure why Kent isn't here, with Lane laid up the way she is. Not to mention Superman. Olsen, you thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Mr. Kent hasn't been too forthcoming. It's obvious now. Kent only took the foreign assignment to get away from here. From the pain of seeing Lane this way. She must really mean a lot to him. Hang on just a little longer, Lois. What the--? What the--? Olsen, why are you still here? Because you told me not to hover around the hospital. Gotta give the doctors room to work. Well, you gotta get your mind off this. Gotta do something with yourself. Okay, I'll go to the hospital. No. Look, kid. I really should have a reporter at the Luthor shindig tonight. -You go. -But I'm a photographer. Well, I'm short-staffed. My ace newshounds are either overseas... ...or on their deathbeds. I'll report anything you want me to report, Mr. White. It just won't be Ms. Lane's obit, because she's gonna be all right. You know she's gonna be all right. -Clark? -Yes. Yes, Lois. You mean, you...? Thank you all for coming. You cut quite a rug, Senator Marquez. Try the fiesta dip, Mrs. Mayor. It'll put hair on your back. Is this thing on? Now, the new reports are true. LexCorp's had a run of rough luck recently. Heck, we can't even locate half our satellites. But I want to state for the public record... ...that my company will never cease in its mission to devote all its resources... ...to the goodwill of Lexopolis-- Metropolis. Do not resist, mortals. I now control all transmissions. Metropolis belongs to Brainiac. And no sign of Superman. I guess it's time to try on a new suit. Downtown Metropolis has come under attack! Well, where is the Man of Steel when you most need him? Allow me to put my money where my mouth is. Members of the press, I suggest you grab your cameras... ...and meet me downtown in five. Okay. Okay, Olsen, you're a reporter. So, what would Ms. Lane do? Get another angle on things. Well, our big-brained alien ally couldn't have timed that better. Now Luthorman smacks him down while the world watches. Get ready for your close-up, Mr. Luthor. Luthor's working with Brainiac? What would Ms. Lane do? Find proof. My mind is so blown. I'm alive, with you. Lois, take it easy. You're still weak. You always catch me when I fall, Clark Kent. It makes total sense. I'm such a fool for not seeing it. And for not ever imagining I'd be pressing my lips to yours... ...before Superman's . I'm not sure it's the right time, Lois. Got you. You're thinking romantic setting. Say, a candlelit table back at Le Chateau? Lois, now that I know you're safe, I need to stop Brainiac. He could find me again, find us. Clark, you said so yourself: Brainiac thinks Superman is dead. We're both safe, as long as we leave it that way. I'm willing to live without Superman as long as I have you... ...the man behind the glasses. It's not only us, Lois. All of Metropolis is in danger, our entire planet. If I don't stop Brainiac, who will? Special Ops, Navy SEALS, that Green Lantern guy. Something's not right. Everything is right, don't you see? I'm here, Clark, with you, just like you wanted. You wouldn't know what I wanted, not unless I told you or unless-- This isn't Metropolis. I never left. No, wait. Clark, don't leave me! You're not Lois, you're a phantom. Lois is still in Metropolis. We've done everything we can. I don't expect her to last the hour. Leave planet Earth now... ...or feel the might of the new Man of Steel. Look! I destroyed Superman. Destroying you, Lex Luthor, will be a snap. He really milks the drama. You're going down, clown! Come on! Spread out. Appreciate the Method acting, but go easy, fella. Bad back. Acting? Did you really think I would ever hand Earth over to you, Luthor? Well, actually, Brainy, no. So remember those goodies I packed into your shuttle? I threw in a little hidden Easter egg called "self-destruct mechanism." So nice working with you. You underestimate my intelligence. My biotechnics located your mechanism, which I deactivated. Oh, boy. Now I shall deactivate you. Come on, get enough coverage, Olsen. There's bound to be something incriminating here. This area is restricted. I was just looking for the little boys' room. The film. I'm sorry, you'll have to speak to Mr. White about that. Editor in chief of the Daily Planet? You know something, newsboy? You're kind of cute. l-- I am? Too bad I have to break you. -Look! -Up in the sky! It's Superman! What? The son of Krypton lives? But how? Long story, Brainiac. One I don't have time to share. Give me that film! Oh, no! Rooting for you, my man. No! Superman! The reactor's gonna blow! You want your camera, newsboy? Come and get it. Fun dancing with you, Mercy. But I will take my camera, thank you. Oh, man. Good game, Supey. You and I make strange allies, but.... In any event, how lucky for the original Man of Steel... ...that my patented Lexosuit softened up Brainiac for him, huh? So that is what provides the son of Krypton with newfound power. No! She fought bravely, Superman... ...but there's no more time. Clark? No, Lois. It's me, Superman. Welcome to your Fortress of Solitude, Kal-EI. That is, what remains of it. I'll rebuild it, with your help. And Ms. Lane? A clean bill of health. Though I came close, too close, to losing her. It's best for her safety if I keep my distance. It's best for Lois... ...if Clark Kent retires from the Daily Planet. Sure, I got a little banged up... ...but self-sacrifice comes with the territory when you're Metropolis' protector. Me and Superman, that is. In fact, you might say I'm Superman's pal. Actually, I believe that honor belongs to Jimmy Olsen of the Planet. What about reports that your bodyguard assaulted the Olsen kid? He was trespassing. Poor girl thought he was a burglar. Another thing, Mr. Luthor. This was found within Brainiac's remains. The LexCorp logo is inscribed on its underside. Do you care to comment? Mercy, phone my attorneys. All of them. Told you Mercy would eat you alive. Yeah, she's a real tiger. I failed you, Mr. White. I didn't get the story. Well, stick to photography, Olsen. I got one of my ace newshounds back. Hey, what about lunch? I think you're covered, Jimmy. I heard you like cheeseburgers and chili fries. Yeah. You betcha. Where is your other ace newshound, anyway? It's not that he didn't wanna be here, Lois. You know, chief, the thing about Clark... ...you hardly notice him when he's around. But when he's not.... -Clark! -I came as soon as I could, Lois. Guess I missed all the excitement. It's good to see you, Clark. White. Kent, you're back not a moment too soon. Seems some superpowered imp calling himself Mr. Mxyz-- Mxyz-- Whatever he's called. He's causing some kind of cockamamie topsy-turvy down at the wharf. Mr. White-- Perry... ...this is hard for me. Maybe harder than almost anything I've ever had to say. It's about my job. The reason I returned was to let you know that... ...I don't think I can work-- Lane? I'm on it, chief. The wharf. And step on it. Lane sure lives dangerously. Yes. Yes, she does. Whether I'm around or not. So, Kent, about the job? You don't think you can what? Don't think I can be your foreign correspondent, Perry. I was really homesick. We missed you too, Kent. I think Lois will be just fine... ...as long as Superman and Clark Kent are around to look out for her.
