I like you from here to Helsinki. - Oh that's very much! Hi there! Smells like teen pussy! Fresh pussy! More shit, Mr. White? - Okey. Well? - It's OK. You don't feel kind of funny? - No. This is your third shot. You should be like in Wonderland or something already. This ain't my shit! - It's not? Have a look on the backseat, I should have more shit in there. Mate stop! What the fuck are you doing? I said the backseat. Oh the backseat, OK. The trunk was locked. - Damn right it's locked. Mr. White. Don't touch the trunk again, OK? - OK. Fuck me! You're so funny. - You're more funny when you're drunk. Well? Tell me. - No. Come on, tell me. - No. Just tell me the color of your panties. - Is that really so important? I want to know. Show me. - No! Move!

Do you really think so? - Of course. What are you doing? Well? They fit my hands perfectly.- Solid, nice tits. They are the perfect tits. Oh sorry! - It's OK. What? - We got an alert from Kevtlaakso area. A real alert, not a reindeer crash or so. Maybe it was a prank call. - All alerts must be checked. There's a giant animal, which is after the tourists. It has an enormous penis, and - it speaks English. - English? Do you smell it? I smell something fishy about this. I had a great night with you, Sara. Good night. Where's Sara? She was so drunk, so I tucked her to bed. Sara? What's wrong? Tuomas is not answering. He's probably at the sauna still. I'll go get him. Rabbit in the ditch, sits and sleeps, sits and sleeps. - Poor rabbit, are you sick, - Hey! What's the situation with the car? - It should be working by the morning. So we'll be leaving in the morning then. Cheers. A rabbit is sitting - - Tuomas! What the hell? Should we call the police? Is that so? Thanks for your help. Don't worry, Emma. The police will take care of this. Can you put it back on? - No. Should we have taken more guns with us? - I was thinking the same thing. 1-2, do you copy? We copy. - There's a new alert from the same area. - Youngsters have been partying and one of them is now missing. - Description; about 25-year old, Caucasian man, 180 cm and slim. - He's wearing a pink shirt with a vagina figure. - Please check it out while you're there. - Roger that. Let's split up. If only time and place were different - - I know. I'd fuck myself too. The vagina! This is jamming. - You have the safety on. Like this. I know what you were doing. - And I know what you were doing, pervert! Do you like me? Well, Jesse-boy? I think we both have something we want from each other. I would appreciate if you didn't tell anyone about this little moment I had with Sara. And I think you would appreciate it if I gave you a little kiss to a cheek. I want you to take my virginity. Well, - you can have a kiss, with tongue. - And you can touch my breasts too. Enough? Okey Enough! You're a man now.- If you ever break our deal and tell Sara or anyone else anything, you'll be liar and a stupid child. Not a man. Pussy! Put a condom on. - I don't have any. I left them in my room. Make sure you don't cum inside me. - I won't. Oops. Get lost! You fucking monkey! Are you absolutely sure? I saw it. Thank you, Jesse. Can I keep these? Get packing, we're moving out in the morning. - What if I want to stay? Then I have to kill you. Im not fucking joking. What's wrong? - Sara is awake. It should be working now. - Are you sure about that, Mr. White? What's wrong, Mr. Black? - Nothing's wrong, Mr. White. Close your eyes for a minute. - Okey. I got laid and Tuomas is missing. - You did? What do you mean Tuomas is missing? Where? - What? Tuomas is missing. I called the cops. You did what? What's wrong Mr. Black? What? One of us is missing. - They called the cops. Dirty pussy! Pussy! Help! Help!- Let's save the booze! Pussy! What? I know. What's going on downstairs? - It's after pussy. So, there's two of you then?
