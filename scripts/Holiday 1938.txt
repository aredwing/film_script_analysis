Why, that's Johnny Case. Open up. Open up or I'll break it down. - Johnny. - Hello, Susan. - How are you? Good to see you. - Nick. Get out of Johnny's arms and let him come in. When did you get back? Few minutes ago. I didn't have time to go home. - Mind if I leave my grips here? - No. - You both look fine. So long. - Wait, we haven't seen you in two weeks. - You can't run away. - I've got a date. There's a cab waiting. - What of it? - Have some breakfast. - How was your vacation? - Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Guess he liked it. I must go. She's waiting. I haven't seen her since Wednesday. - She? Who? - My wife. - Nick, did you hear the man? - The room is going round and round. She's not exactly my wife yet. But she's going to be. It's all arranged. Take it easy, now. Everything will be all right. - Lie down right there. - Wait a minute. That's it now. Tell us all about it from the beginning. - Who is she? - What's her name? - Why marry her? - How'd you meet? - What does she do? - Come, boy. Wait. It's love, fellows. I've met the girl. She is... I can't describe her, but the first thing you notice are her dimples when she smiles. - Why didn't you say so in the first place? - That's going to make her the perfect wife. I've found her. I didn't think they came that way anymore. She's sweet, intelligent, the perfect playmate. Listen, you haven't told us anything yet. We're not letting any wench snag you without a struggle. - Who is this girl? What does she do? - I don't know. What do most girls do? Don't tell me you didn't find out anything about her? Sure. She wants me, the life I want, the home I want, the fun I want. - What about her family? - What about her family? What about her family? - Didn't you find out anything about them? - No. Sure, I did. She's got a brother, a sister and a father. Now is that good enough? Come on, Nick, really, I've got to go. Come on, fellow, up. Thanks. I'll be late. Where's my hat? - Well, what do you make of it? - I can see the whole thing. Father, too old to work. Brother, a pool shark. Sister can't keep a job on account of she's too pretty. Poor little Dimples has to work her fingers to the bone to support them. Wouldn't that be marvellous? Johnny Case comes into her life and takes her away. - Here's your hat. I give up. - Thanks. 'Bye, Susan. 'Bye, Nick. I'll drop in later and tell you all about her. - Johnny? - What? Listen, when you find yourself with a family to support and things get tough... Teaching at the university doesn't pay me very much, but... That's sweet, but when things get tough, when I feel a worry coming on... ...you know what I do. There. And then the worries are over. Good-bye, you comics. Good luck, Johnny. - What's this? - You said 843, didn't you? Yeah, but... I guess she must work here. Thanks, bud. It's the ice-cream man. Excuse me. Does a Miss Julia Seton live here? Miss Seton gave me this address. My name is Case, John Case. Miss Julia is expecting you, Mr. Case. Then she does live here? I beg your pardon, but it's the usual custom... ...for Miss Julia's callers to arrive at the front door. I'm sorry. - Lf you'll come this way, Mr. Case. - Thanks. Excuse me. Judas! I beg your pardon? I just said, "Judas." It didn't mean anything. If you'll leave your hat and coat here, sir. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Ned. Your father has just left for church. He said he couldn't wait for you. - Did I get home all right last night? - Everything is perfectly all right, sir. - How did I get this bump on my forehead? - You slipped in your bathroom. I'll want a drink in my room as soon as I get home from church. Yes, sir. Say, this... What do people... If you'll come this way, sir. If you'll wait in the living room, sir. The second button. I shall notify Miss Julia that you are here. I could have walked that. Johnny. Johnny. Darling. Darling. - Hello, sweet. - Hello. Johnny, mind your manners. - Darling, where are we? - Where I live. You promised to change that tie. That hair. Julia, seriously, what is all this? I told you, where I live. I wrote it down on the back of an envelope for you. But it's enormous. I'm overcome. It's the Grand Central Station. Bad echo. Stop criticizing this house or I'll send for the bouncer. - Stop. Now I'm off to church. - Wait. Do you want to know what happened? - I went to the kitchen door to ask for you. - You didn't. I figured you were a secretary or an old lady's companion. - You sure you aren't? - Cross my heart. - What's that silly thing? Look at that. - Stop it, Johnny. You must all be so rich. Well, we aren't exactly poor. You should have told me, you really should. - Would it have made any difference? - Certainly. I'd have asked you to marry me in two days instead of ten. - Aren't you funny? - Funny, why? Well, to talk about it. - Money? Why, is it so sacred? - No, of course not. I'm simply delighted. That's all. If I suddenly discovered you could play piano, I'd be delighted. Having money is like knowing how to play the piano? Well, they're both very pleasant accomplishments for a girl. Don't worry, if I'm stuck with a rich girl I'll grit my teeth and make the best of it. - But you're going to make millions yourself. - But, no, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - No. - Yes. - No, not Mr. Case's little boy. I'm a plain man of the people. I began life with these two bare hands. So did the gentleman over the fireplace. Take heart from Grandfather. - Don't tell me you're one of those Setons? - Yes, Johnny. Forgive us, but we are. This is too much. What man has done, man can do, or words to that effect. Now see here, if you think I'm going to be any young wizard of finance, you're... Cheer up, it's not at all that serious. If you don't think breaking the news of this engagement to Father is serious... - You said you were going to church? - I am. That's why I'm clever. Because Father's in church and in church Father can't talk. - Are you that afraid of him? - No. But this is the best way. You know, Father is a wonderful man, but he has to be handled just right. You leave that to me. Your job is to drop me off at church and be back before 1:00 for lunch... ...and don't be late. His first impression of you is terribly important. What if I crawled in on my hands and knees? Would he like that? Now don't jest, boy. Now, come on, darling. Let's not let the fun get out of it. - Is it likely to? - No, but... Say it. Well, what's the idea of spilling it so quickly? Well, I have to tell Father. He'd never forgive me. Yeah, but it could be such a swell guilty secret for a while. I can't see what particular fun a secret would be. - Can't you, dear? - No. All right. - It's getting pretty complicated, isn't it? - You didn't think it'd be simple, did you? - I suppose I just didn't think. - You couldn't have. Johnny, what's the matter with you? I just hate the thought of sitting down with another man... ...and being practical about you. Angel. Look, darling, it's got to be done though. - I love you, Julia. - I love you, Johnny. - That's the main thing, isn't it? - Darling, that's everything. - Kiss? - With pleasure. Why, Julia, for shame. Is this the way to spend Sunday morning? Who's your partner, anyone I know? Johnny, my sister, Linda. This is Johnny Case. - How do you do? - Well, thanks, and you? - Couldn't be better. - Good. - He's Johnny Case. I'll marry him. - That makes it all right then. In about one month I'll marry him, Linda. What? Stand out here in the light, will you, Case? - I've never seen him before. - Neither had I until 10 days ago at Placid. But how did you get together? Tell me everything. - I was... - Well, I... Go ahead. I was walking along the road one morning to the rink... ...when whom should I see, but this man coming along carrying his skis. Well, fancy that. A downright romance. Go on, dear. He had a queer look on his face. I can believe that. His eyes must have been burning. No. As a matter of fact, the trouble was with his nose. So I stopped him and said: "Pardon me. I don't think you realize it, but your nose is frozen." He said, "Thanks. Can you personally do something about it?" - Fresh. - I thought so, too. She was fresh to mention it. It looked to me like a pickup. I know a good thing when I see it. Just a minute. Does Father know about these goings-on? I'm off to church to tell him now. This modern generation. Well, young man, I hope you realize what you're getting yourself in for. I didn't know I was marrying into a house with an elevator. It isn't only the elevator. The place is haunted. You mean ghosts? Frightful ghosts all wearing stuffed shirts and mink-lined ties. Any skeletons in the closet? - Julia hasn't told you about Grandfather? - No. - He stole a railroad from the stockholders. - That's not true. And of course you've heard about me. I'm the black sheep. That's a goat. - Don't pay attention to her. - The engagement's off. I won't marry into any family with a black sheep. - I think I like this man. - Hello. You'll see him at lunch. 'Bye, darling, we've got to fly. See you at lunch, Sis. Placid was lovely, Father. I met a young man up there. He's coming to lunch today. His name is Case. Johnny Case. - I'm going to marry him, Father. - What? Did I understand you to say... And who may Johnny Chase be? - Case, Father, not Chase. - Well, then, Case. Father. Will you please tell me... Marry? Did you actually say that? Charming service. - A lovely service. - Thank you. - We shall have to talk at once, Julia. - Yes. You haven't as yet told me one intelligent fact about this... Johnny? He's a man with a definite future. He's with Sloan and Hobson. - Indeed? I know Sam Hobson. - You do? Hello, Julia. Hello, Marjorie. You look well. - A mild, lovely Sunday, Edward. - Quite. - Did you have a little accident, Ned? - So they say. I don't seem to have been there when it happened. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Kindly put your hat on, Ned. I believe I see Mr. Hobson now. - Run along home. - Yes, Father. Take your time, Father. The front door this time. Miss Julia has not returned from church yet, sir. I'll walk around the block. - You're expected in the playroom, sir. - Playroom? Miss Linda asked that you be sent up the moment you arrived, sir. Miss Linda. - The playroom is on the fourth floor, sir. - Thanks. - Hey! - Hey, yourself. I'm lost. A lot of people haven't been coming up here. Want a bite? Thanks. The bell captain sent me up. This is quite different. From the rest of the house, I mean. This was Mother's idea. She thought there should be one fun room in the house. She used to be up here as much as we were before she died. I think it was a kind of escape for her. She was marvellous. That's quite a doll. - That was Julia's. - Yeah? She loved it. My, how she loved it. Looks like her. Did she love that, too? Now don't you say a word about Leopold. He's very sensitive. - Yours? - Looks like me. - Who's the musician in the family? - My brother, Ned. I saw him this morning when I arrived. At least I saw somebody with a hangover. That was Ned. He could have been a fine musician. - What do you mean? - Lf Father hadn't interfered. - Who performed on the flying trapeze? - All of us. And a terrible cousin of ours named Seton Cram. He and I used to swing by our knees and spit at each other. - Nice goings-on. - I'm happy to say now, I rarely missed. There's Julia and I as kids. She was beautiful even then, wasn't she? Case? What? I love my sister Julia more than anything else in the world. I don't blame you, so do I. She's so sweet, you don't know. Yes, I do. She's beautiful and exciting, too, don't you think? Stop it. I'll start jittering. It's terribly important that she should marry the right person. - That's important for everyone. - No. It's particularly so for Julia. I suppose you realize you're a rather strange bird in these parts? How's that? You don't know the men we see as a rule. Where've you been? Working hard. - Nights? - Nights, too. What about these little jaunts to Placid? Come clean, Case. Want to know something? That was the first holiday I ever had. - No. - Sure. - Then you can't have been working long. - Only just since I was 10. - Ten? - Sure. At what? Anything I could get. Financial house the last few years. Does she paint? She never told me. No, you don't. - Why, isn't she any good? - It isn't hers, it's mine. There lies Linda the artist. Don't disturb the ashes. Frankly, I stank. What did you try after you discovered you couldn't paint? - Case, are you drawing me out? - Sure. Come on. - You really want to know? - Sure. Well, I tried to go on the stage. Would you care to see me do the sleepwalking scene from Macbeth? - "Out, damned spot!" - No, some other time. The teachers at Miss Porter's School thought it was very promising. - What else? - There were lots of humorous episodes. I tried to get Father to let me take a nursing course at a hospital. Yes, and I almost got arrested trying to help some strikers over in Jersey. How was I to know that Father was on the board of directors of the company? You see, Case, the trouble with me is that I never could decide... ...whether I wanted to be Joan of Arc, Florence Nightingale or John L. Lewis. - What's the matter, you fed up? - To the neck. Even with this million-dollar museum? All those marble pillars down there? Case, compared to the life I lead... ...the last man in a chain gang thoroughly enjoys himself. What you need's some time off from what you've been doing day in, day out. You mean from what I've not been doing days in, please, years out. How does your garden grow, Case? Is life wonderful where you are? It can be. - But it hasn't been? - I don't call what I've been doing "living." - What do you recommend for yourself? - A holiday. - For how long? - For as long as I need. - You mean just to play? - No, I've been working since I was 10. I want to find out why I'm working. The answer can't be just to pay bills or pile up more money. Even if you do, the government takes most of it. - But what is the answer? - That's what I intend to find out. The world is changing out there. There's new exciting ideas running around. Some right, some cock-eyed, but they are affecting our lives. I want to know how I stand, where I fit in, what all this will mean to me. I can't find that out sitting behind a desk in an office. I'm going to get money together, and then knock off. - Quit? - Quit. I want to save part of my life for myself. There's a catch to it though, it's got to be part of the young part. You know, retire young and work old. Come back and work when I know what I'm working for. - Does that make sense to you? - That makes a lot of sense. - Does Julia know? - No. I won't get her hopes up until I get enough money. She has enough for two right now, or for 10, for that matter. I don't want her dough. I've got to earn it myself. That's foolish. You're all right, though. You haven't been bitten or caught by it yet. - By what? - The reverence for riches. - Look out for that, Johnny. - No, not for me. - Who took the Scotch from my closet? - What happened in church? - It was in my riding boots, a full quart. - Neddie, shut up. Did Julia tell Father? I haven't been up here in years. What did Father say? We left Father talking about that guy to Mr. Hobson in front of church. - Who's the egg anyway? - I'm the egg. And he's a good egg, too. Johnny Case, my brother, Ned. How are you? Congratulations! This place gives me the creeps. I've been telling Johnny about some of our childhood dreams. Some dreams. It's in tune. I thought you'd want to come back and finish that concerto you were writing. The Seton Concerto in F Major. Come on, Neddie. Neddie, play it. Play it, Neddie. Johnny and I can bear it. Can't we? You really want to hear it? Neddie, no. I've been boasting about you. Hello. What are you all doing up here? What a morning. - What did Father say? - He isn't home yet. I want to know the minute Mr. Seton returns. Buzz up here twice, will you? Thanks. - Was it terrible at church? - Not so bad, but there's dirty weather ahead. Now you... - Johnny, you didn't change that tie. - That's right, I didn't. Well, never mind, Ned can lend you one. I feel like a goat being prepared for the sacrifice. Now, that's a sheep. What you need is a drink. - We'd better give him some coaching. - I'd be grateful. Firstly, Father will want to know how you're fixed. - Fixed? - Money. How much? You wouldn't expect it of a man in Father's position, but money is our God here. - Johnny, it isn't true at all. - No? What is, then? Well, young man? Well, sir, at the moment I have in my pocket exactly $34... ...and a coupon for a Bank Night at a Lake Placid movie. No gilt-edge securities, no rolling woodlands? I have a few shares of common stock tucked away in a warm... Common, don't say the word. I'm afraid he won't do. He's a comely boy, but probably just another of the vast army of clock-watchers. - How are you socially? - Nothing much there either. Your mother wasn't even a whooziz? - Nope. - Linda, I do wish you'd shut up. - Maybe he's got a judge in the family. - Yes, that might help. Old Judge Case's boy. White pillars, guitars a-strumming. - 'Evening, Master. - How you all, Miss Linda? - Know any prominent people? Drop names. - Just casually, you know. At Mrs. Onderkonk's cockfight last Tuesday, whom should I see but Mrs. Marble. - I thought we'd die laughing. - Johnny, this is rot. "Johnny," she calls me... - Linda, will you be quiet? - I'm having a swell time. This is terrible. Do you realize that you are trying to marry into one of America's 60 families? When I find myself in a position like this I ask myself... ...what would General Motors do? Then I do the opposite. As long as you don't do a back flip-flop. - Can you do a back flip-flop? Really? - Sure. But, you'll have to teach me. I can do almost anything else. It'll be a pity if it doesn't come off, it'll be a real pity. Yes, it'll be a pity if this doesn't come off, too. Okay. Alley. It's Father. He's home. Come on, Johnny. - What about the flip thing? - No. Linda and I will go down and talk to him. You go with Ned. - Why? - You're not supposed to have arrived yet. - When do I arrive? - 1:00. 1:00. And please change that tie. Ned will tell you exactly when to put in an appearance. This is getting very complicated, if you ask me. Nobody asked you. Now go on. Do as you're told. Stop it. Go on, Case. Don't expect simplicity here. Just think of Fifth Avenue frontage. Lend him a tie, Ned. - You do like him, don't you? - She asks me if I like him. Dear girl, do you realize that life walked into this house this morning? Darling, don't let him get away. It'll be the same old story, of course. - I'm being married for my money. - That's always flattering, isn't it? What's the use of all we've got unless to get us a superior type of man? Linda, I hate you to talk like that. But, Julia, seriously he's like spring. He's like a breath of fresh air. Do you know what he called this place? A museum. Julia, here's your chance. That's just it. I want Father to see that Johnny has the same qualities Grandfather had. You don't know Johnny. You don't know how far he's come already and from what. - Or where he's going. - I do. I know, I can see it as clear as day. If it does go through all right, when are you going to announce it? - Right away. Next Saturday. - Darling, let me give a party for it. Now look, Father is to have nothing to do with it. Saturday is New Year's Eve. Julia, let's have some fun in this house before you leave it. - Lf Father doesn't mind. - No ifs at all. And just a few people. Just your friends and Johnny's and up in the old playroom. Let me plan it. Let me give it. Let me do something for you once. Me, Julia. I'd love it darling, really I would. No, but you see, this is awfully important to me now. Now no one must touch my party but me, do you hear? All right, darling. Now if they do, I won't come to it. Linda... ...it'll be awful to leave you. Julia, I don't know what I'll do when you go. I've got to do something. I've got to get out, quit, change on it somehow or I'll go mad. I could curl up and die right now. Why, my foot. I don't look sick, do I? You know, this is a museum. Never mind about me. I'll be all right. Look out for yourself. Don't let him bully you. - Good morning. - Good morning, Father. - Did you see Mr. Hobson, Father? - Just for a moment. There's another thing to be considered. What is the young man's background? What did Mr. Hobson say? But we mustn't rush into things, must we? I want to be married on January 10. That's two weeks from this Tuesday. Impossible. - Why? - Yes, why? I won't stand for a long engagement. The boy has loads of charm, Father. - You know him? - I've heard tell of him. Charm. I suppose it's solid merit you're after. The rumour is he's got that, too. A sterling chap on the whole. A catch, in fact. Have you the financial section of the Times, Ned? No. I try to take Sundays off when I can. Which reminds me, I'd like you to remain in the office until 6:00. - 6:00? What for? - As an example to the other men. - But there's nothing for me to do after 3:00. - You'll find something. See here, Father, if you think I'm going to fake... Did you understand me, Ned? Father, what did Mr. Hobson say? It wasn't the time or place to go into the matter with him. I asked him to drop by tonight. Father, but what did he say? His report was not at all unfavourable. - That must have been a blow. - He appears to have some business ability. He has put through a successful reorganization of Seaboard Utilities. - Seaboard? Poor fellow. - Shrewd fellow, perhaps. Hobson says the signs are not unfavourable for Seaboard. We'll buy some in the morning, Ned. But we must know more about Mr. Chase's background. Case, Father. Let it go. Chase has such a sweet banking sound. - Father, he's from Baltimore. - Fine, old, pre-war stock, I imagine. Wasn't there a Judge Case somewhere? I intend to know more about the young man than his name and his place of birth. It would be advisable that when he arrives he finds me alone... ...in order that I may conduct the inquiry along my own lines. I won't allow the subject of an engagement to come up in my first talk with him. Wouldn't you like me to hide under the sofa and take shorthand notes? I don't believe that'll be necessary. I think the poor guy ought to see one friendly face in the courtroom. Yes, Henry? - Mr. Case wishes to be announced, sir. - Yes, Henry. You will all excuse yourselves on one pretext or another. Keep a stiff upper lip, Father. No doubt the fellow is an impostor. - Father. - Yes, Julia? Remember, I know what I want. Come in. I hope I'm not late. I got caught in traffic. Father, this is Mr. Case. - How do you do? - How do you do, sir? My daughter Linda. - How do you do? - How do you do? And my son, Edward. - How do you do? - How do you do? Ned, if you and your sisters will do the telephoning you spoke about... ...I shall try and entertain Mr. Case. We'll be back in a few minutes, Johnny. What would we do without the telephone? I believe you had something you wanted to do, Linda? Me, Father? I can't remember a thing. We seem to be enjoying quite an unusual freedom from snow this winter. I like snow. That's why I went up to Lake Placid. Placid? Yes, my daughter Julia has just come from there. Yes, I know. - You're in business in New York, Mr. Case? - Yes, sir. I'm with Sloan and Hobson. An excellent firm. - A born New Yorker? - No, no. I was born in Baltimore. July 6, 1908. I'm 30. I used to have a lot of good friends in Baltimore. Let me see. The Whites, the Clarence Whites. - Possibly you knew them? - I don't believe I ever did. - No? And there was Archer Fuller's family. - I'm afraid not. Let me see, Colonel Evans, old Philip Evans. No. I haven't been there in some years and, well, I wouldn't know them anyway. You see, my father had a small grocery store in Baltimore. Yes. He never made a go of it though... ...and when he died he left several debts which Mother worked hard to clear up. I was just a child at the time and I couldn't help her very much. Mother died the May before my 16th birthday. How sad. Yes, it was pretty sad. I hadn't any connections except for an uncle... ...who's in the roofing business in Wilmington. He wasn't much good, though. He was inclined to get drunk. Still is. We have an uncle like that but he keeps off roofs. Mother had wanted me to go to a big Eastern college... ...so I worked my way through Harvard. In vacations, I worked in a steel mill and in an automobile factory. One summer I drove a garbage truck. Admirable. No, they simply happened to be the only jobs I could get... ...but you can learn a lot in a steel mill, a lot you don't get at Harvard. Anything else, sir? I beg your pardon? I should think you would. Is there anything else you'd like to know about me? Why, that is... Well, Mr. Seton, how about it? - About it? About what? - About Julia and me, getting married. Why, this is a complete surprise to me. I hardly know what to say to you. - Well, "yes" would be pleasant. - I'm sure it would. However, we must go into the matter a little more carefully, I'm afraid. The only difficulty about that is the time. Julia's idea is January 10. Mine, too. We'll see about that. May I ask how we shall see, sir? Mr. Case, I don't know you at all. I'll give you every opportunity you permit me. - Lunch tomorrow? - Tomorrow I have... Tuesday? Suppose you meet me at the Bankers' Club at 1:00 on Friday? I'm sorry, but Friday's out. I've got business in Boston that day. Better make it tomorrow. I'll see whether I can rearrange my engagements. Ned, Julia, nearly time for lunch, isn't it? In the meantime, I think Mr. Sloan or Mr. Hobson might say a good word for me. I'm decent and civilized and I love your daughter, which isn't hard. She seems to like me, too, and that's about all that can be said for me... ...except that we have a grand chance of being happy. - So do I. - Come on, Father, be an angel. The matter is too important to be decided offhand. You'll be married when I've come to a decision and on a day which I will name. - Our plan was the 10th. - That is out of the question. - Yes, Henry? - Luncheon, sir. - Mr. Seton, l... - Luncheon, Mr. Chase. A very interesting necktie you have. Thank you. I have a haberdasher who's made my ties for a good many years... ...and that particular pattern I seem to recognize. Possibly, sir, because this happens to be your necktie. Ned and I thought it might bring me luck. Father. Come in, Julia. I thought you might like some hot chocolate. Thank you. I just saw Mr. Hobson leave. - Did you and he have a nice talk? - Yes. Father... ...what have you decided? Marriage is an extremely important step for a young girl. Mother was younger than I when she married you. In marrying me, your mother and her family took no risk, either financially... ...or, if I may say so, spiritually. - Johnny will do well financially. - No doubt about it. - Hobson tells me he has great possibilities. - I know it. Then it's all right? - Do you see that cigar? - Yes, Father. That's a brand of cigar I've smoked for 35 years. Your grandfather smoked the same brand. I know the quality of tobacco in it because I own the plantation where it was grown... ...and I know therefore that when I light it, it will burn smoothly and pleasantly. And I know above everything else that it will never explode in my face. And you're afraid that Johnny might? There's a strange new spirit at work in the world today... ...a spirit of revolt. I don't understand it and I don't like it. Don't worry about Johnny. I know him better than you. My dear, I've never denied you anything that was in my power to give. He'll burn, Father, calmly, steadily, pleasantly. It's only of you and your happiness I'm thinking. Father... ...you can trust me. I'll take care of myself. Thank you, Father. - Can we announce it New Year's Eve? - I shall arrange a party. How wonderful! Linda had said something about wanting to give a party herself. One of those ideas of hers. I think by now you and I know how to take care of those ideas of Linda's. - It was awfully sweet of her. - Linda has many generous impulses. Father? Come in, Linda. Is it yes? Father, I knew you'd do it. - Be careful, you'll put my cigar out. - What's a cigar on a night like this? Darling, I'm so glad. Have you told Johnny? - I haven't had time. - Telephone him right away. Well, then let's ring bells. Let's send up skyrockets. Let's turn on all the lights in the house. Father, aren't you proud of yourself? Gee, this would have made Mother happy. Mother, you'd love him. Don't forget I'm to give the party to announce the engagement. I've got it all planned. Just a few people, Johnny's friends and Julia's... ...and up in the old playroom. No formalities, no white ties, no engraved invitations. I like your tie, too. - By the way, where's Linda? - She'll be down soon. I'm sure she will. - She just hates big parties. - But not this one? Johnny, look at Father. He's just seething with excitement. You've won his heart completely. - He's been awfully nice to me. - Father's such a dear. He made all the arrangements for the party himself. Is that the fellow? He's rather good-looking at least. - Hello, Uncle Edward. - Good evening. - Seton. - Good evening, Uncle Edward. There's Laura and Seton Cram. He's my cousin. Darling, tell me, when are you to announce the exciting news about Julia? Shortly after midnight as a surprise. Well, Julia seems divinely happy. What does Linda say? You know, we haven't seen Linda all evening. Linda has been somewhat indisposed. If asked, please explain she has a headache. Yes, of course, Linda's headaches. Now, don't worry, darling, we understand perfectly. She shall come down before the announcement. Of course. Now don't worry, darling, you just leave everything to us, will you? It's a lovely party. Now what's the matter with Linda? Hello, Dorothy, you look lovely. - Dear, where'd she get that horrible dress? - Uncle Edward is worried, isn't he? - Hello, Bunny. - Hello, Seton. I'd be worried, too, if I had children like Ned and Linda. Now he takes an utter stranger into the family. I don't approve of it at all. If Linda had done it I could understand, but for Julia to take an unknown climber... Mother's furious about it. He's obviously after Julia's money. Hello, Countess. He doesn't even belong to the Harvard Club. Julia, darling, you look lovely. - Hello, Laura. - Thank you, dear. - Hello, Seton. - I'm Cousin Laura and I'm so happy about it. My dear, he is attractive, isn't he? This is my husband, Seton Cram. He's Julia's cousin. - I married into the family. - Not a bad family to marry into. Congratulations. - Thank you, Mr. Cram. - Don't "Mister" him. We grew up together. We've heard such wonderful things about you. - Have you? From whom? - Well, from everybody. My dear, it's such a shame about Linda. She does have such frightful luck with those headaches of hers, doesn't she? Yes. There's Ned. We've been looking for him. Come on. We'll see you later. - Good-bye, Johnny. - See you later, Johnny. Ned, did you speak to Linda? How do you like Seton and Laura? It's a privilege to meet them, don't you think? What did Linda say? Cheer up, Johnny. If you find Seton and Laura dull, wait until you meet some of the others. The more you find out about us Setons, the more impressive we become. Father wanted a big family, you know. Mother had Linda straight off to oblige him. Linda was a girl, so she promptly had Julia. Julia was a girl and it seemed hopeless. The next year Mother had me and there was much joy in the land. It was a boy and the fair name of Seton would flourish. It must have been a consolation to Father. He must have been very grateful to Mother. Drink to Mother, Johnny. She tried to be a Seton for a while, then gave up and died. You're talking through your hat, Ned. But, I'm not. Ned, what did Linda say? - She's coming down, isn't she? - Don't make me laugh, Sister. - What's all this about Linda? - It's nothing, Johnny. That's right. It's nothing. Just one of Linda's whims. The silly little girl wanted to give her kind of a party. Between you and Father you've changed her shindig into a first-class funeral. She should've realized Father couldn't announce my engagement without a fuss. She should have, yes, but unlike me, Linda always hopes. Bottoms up to Linda. Ned, please, you've been drinking steadily since 8:00. Yes, funny old Ned. On New Year's Eve, too. Johnny, try to stop him. I shall drink as much as I like at any party I agree to attend. And as much as I like is as much as I can hold. It's my protection against your tiresome friends. Linda's out of luck. She hasn't any protection. Robert, another highball, please. Ned, take it easy. Aye, aye, sir. - The name, sir? - The name is Professor Nicholas Potter. And wife Susan. We were invited. The ladies' cloakroom is the second door to the left, madam. Thank you. - Hello, Mr. Thayer. - Well. - It's getting near the New Year. - That's right, sir. - It lacks about an hour, I should say. - An hour and 38 minutes, Edgar. Thank you, sir. - The elevator is to the rear and right. - Would it be too much... Hello, Mr. Jennings. - Coming close to the New Year now. - One hour and 27 minutes, Edgar. - He's fast. - Yes, sir. The elevator is to the rear and right. - Thank you, but you have my shoe. - I beg your pardon. It's quite all right. A very natural mistake, as a matter of fact. Thank you. I'll do it. Don't tell anyone, but I've got a run in my stocking. Good heavens, we're ruined. - Not a word of this to a soul. - No, sir. The elevator... Is to the rear and to the right. I'm sorry. - Perhaps we'd better use the elevator. - To the rear and to the right. I think we'd better go home. Courage, dear, courage. Remember, we promised Johnny that we'd come. This reminds me a little of the palace of the Emperor Caligula. - You remember Caligula, don't you? - Very well, indeed. Whatever became of him? - To the rear... - And to the right. Now where? Seems to have been some sort of a residence at one time. It's the Gashouse Gang, darling. The party's downstairs. Thank you. Sorry to intrude. No. Wait a minute. - You're Susan Elliott? - Yes. My married name is Potter. No, but you lectured once at our school. I'm Linda Seton. - You're not. - Yes. - Johnny said her name was Julia. - Julia's my sister. - You know Johnny? - For years. I'm so glad to see you. Come in. - Who's that? - That is my husband, Nick Potter. You can come in, too. Close the door. Who lives here? I live here. I live here, in a manner of speaking. I see. You wouldn't eat your oatmeal this morning, so they won't let you go to the party? I'm the mad sister, the family problem. The one they don't speak about. - Yes, so was I. - You see what happened to her. - What? - She had to marry me. A professor without a cent of money. So you'd better be a good little girl and eat your porridge. - Sit down, will you? - Thank you. - My, it's good to be home again. - Yes, we've had quite a long walk. - This is a shame, it really is. - Why? I was going to give a party tonight. I had it all planned. I was going to... Well, it was a good idea. It might have been fun. - Your sister, Julia. - Is she anything like you? Don't worry, she's not at all like me. - Haven't you met her yet? - No. You must. Johnny'll be glad to see you. - But you must. It'll spoil Johnny's party. - Definitely no. Definitely no. My brother, Ned. I thought you might want a little cheering up. Ned, how sweet of you, how really sweet. I'm a sweet kid. Take this back to the orchestra leader, please. My brother, Ned, Mr. And Mrs. Potter. Friends of Johnny's. He used to live with us. We've come to warn his future bride. He never puts the cap back on the toothpaste. Then we'll drink a toast to Johnny. He needs it. Needs it? No, I'm wrong. He doesn't need it. Johnny's doing all right. - What's on your mind, Ned? - Nothing's on my mind. What do you mean, "Johnny's doing all right?" I mean he's doing all right. He's having a whirl. His hair's slicked down and Father's seeing that he meets the important people. My word, are there important people downstairs? Frightfully important. That's why I wanted to give a party up here. Miss Seton on New Year's Eve entertained a group of very unimportant people. To our hostess. May I drink, too? Believe it or not, I've just been learning how much it costs to keep up a yacht. - What's the matter? - Father sent for me. It's about Linda. Everybody has begun to talk about her not being here. - She's simply got to come down. - Got to? Go up to the playroom and make her come down now. - I'll ask her. - Insist on it. I'll do what a gentleman can do under the circumstances. - That's good. Was that good? - No! Yeah, marvellous. - Unless I'm getting drunk. - No. It's the first champagne I've had since I was 4. Not really? - Do you mind if I play with your toys? - I think you'd better. - Thank you. - That's all right. He's grand. - Has Johnny any other friends like him? - There aren't many people like Nick. Or like Johnny either, for that matter. - We've had wonderful times, we three. - You'll have a lot more fun with Julia. You must let Ned and me be guest members of the Johnny, Julia, Nick and Susan Club. Look what I've found. Come on, let's do Romeo and Juliet. "What light through yonder window breaks?" - We used to put on shows for the kids. - Did you? - This is a lovely one. - Do one for us. Go ahead. Come on, Neddie. It's all complete, including the characters. You remember any of the lines? Linda. Johnny, come in. - I have a message for you. - And I have a message for you. I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested downstairs. I have the honour to inform you that your presence is requested right here. - There's a meeting of the club. - Your club. No. Come on, the party needs you. Now's the time to come to the aid of the party. But your father is really upset. Why, you don't tell me. What seems to be the matter? Everybody has begun to notice you're not there and it's embarrassing the family. The... Johnny... Linda, be a good sport now. It will make your father awfully happy. Would it make him any happier if I crawled in on my hands and knees? That's telling him. Oh, my. - That's not Johnny. - No? - Who is it? - That's a very important person. Hello, important person. Don't be fresh. - Treat important persons with respect. - I won't. - Hello, important person. - Yeah? Take your place. What is this? It's the voice of experience. Nick and Susan! Sir, that lady is my wife. Nick, thank goodness you came. The face is familiar. But... Do we know anyone who smells of violet? - How's that, you dog. - No. It can't be. It's Johnny Case. You remember him. John Case, the rail-splitter, friend of the people. Yes. - Well, we're glad to have you back. - Back? You mean the marble pillars got me. I'm ready. I'll go quietly. Don't spare him, boys. There. - Now that you've got that off my mind. - Never forget it. There's something I want you to know. - That deal I mentioned? - The Seaboard thing? - I think it'll go through. - You don't mean it? There's a very fair chance that I'll be able to quit business next Saturday. So that you can go on the holiday? Sure, Johnny's Declaration of Independence. It's all according to what a Boston crowd called Bay State Power does. - Maybe they've done it already. - They'll do it! - Then let's drink to Bay State Power. - No, let's drink to Julia. - Have you met her yet? - No. If she's anything like her sister... No, we'll drink to Johnny and Julia and Bay State Power, love and happiness and... Here you are. For the love of Pete, it's The Witch and Dopey. I've never been up here before. It's awfully quaint, isn't it? We like it. Linda, are you aware that there's another party going on in this house? You mean that low-class dancehall downstairs? Don't speak of it. Excuse me, these are my friends. Professor and Mrs. Potter, Mr. And Mrs. Cram. How do you do? You old fox, you. Fox? Sam Hobson's been telling me about your little haul in Seaboard. You might have let us in the family in on it. - There's still time. - Not the way that stock's acting. We have an order to buy 60,000 shares... ...for Ross of Bay State Power all the way up to 30. - Are you sure of that? - I took the order myself. That cinches it. - Is that it? - Just about. Good for you. Come on! Good for you. Have lunch with me at the club on Tuesday. I think I could help you double your yield. My dad made me promise to quit after my first million. You're probably joking, Professor. With the help of the right people in Wall Street... ...you'll make more within two years. It wouldn't take that long if we had the right kind of government. - Like which country for example, Mr. Cram? - Now no political arguments. - Let's go downstairs and celebrate. - Yes, this is a wonderful party. - I'm not going downstairs. - Come on, don't be foolish. - But, Linda, your father said... - I thought so but I'm not going downstairs. - Of course if... - I wouldn't keep anyone who wants to. If you ask me, this is the worst case of downright rudeness I've seen. And has someone asked you? Come, dear, we can discuss this later. You wouldn't care to swing on the trapeze and discuss it now, would you, Seton? We shall see you later, Mrs. Porter. Professor Porter. I thought our name was Potter. I must be wrong. In appreciation of your great success in the fields of love and finance... ...I wish to congratulate you on behalf of the members... ...of the Fifth Avenue Anti-Stuffed Shirt and Flying Trapeze Club. And present you, my dear boy, with this token of their affection and esteem. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Mr. Toastmaster, ladies and gentlemen. My friends. I am not much of a speechmaker, so I hardly know how to thank you. This young lady and myself have been practicing a few feats of acrobatic skill... ...with which we shall be glad to entertain you. Alley. - Ready? - Ready. Put on the lights. Uno momento. - Alley. - Oop. Linda. The club is adjourned. Julia, I've got a grand surprise for you. Just a moment. Come down now. It's nearly 12:00... ...and we want the entire party together to see the New Year in. The New Year comes into this room, too. You've caused enough trouble. Father, if I want to see the New Year in as I had planned, as I had asked you... I think if you don't mind we'll go down and see what's happened to the furnace. Julia, this is Nick and Susan. I told you about them. How do you do? - And Mr. Seton. - Your friends are always welcome here. I'll see you downstairs. Thank you, but as a matter of fact Susan has an awful run in her stocking. Why don't you go down to my room? It's on the third floor. Fine. Congratulations on your engagement, Miss Seton. You're not getting very much, but I'm sure you can improve him. Kindly walk, do not run to the nearest exit. They're grand people. - They'll wait, don't you think? - I don't know. I don't know. There's no cause for temper, child. Run along and we'll follow. Julia and I want to talk to Johnny for a moment. Listen to me, Father, tonight means a good deal to me. I don't know what or how precisely. Something's trying to take it away and I can't let it go. I'll put in an appearance downstairs. Then I want to bring those people back here. I want to sit and have supper with them. We won't disturb anyone. That's all right with you, isn't it? Your place is downstairs. Once more, this is important to me. Don't ask me why. It has something to do with this room... ...when I was a child and good times in it. What special virtue this room has I'm sure I don't know. You don't, do you? No, you can't. I'll tell you, this room's my home, it's the only home I've got. There's something here that I understand and that understands me. - Maybe it's Mother. - Don't talk nonsense. Do as I say. You thought I'd come around. You always think people will come around. Not me, not tonight. And I shan't be disturbed either 'cause if there's one thing you hate, it's a scene. I can promise you one if you interfere. I can promise you a beauty. Johnny, so there's good news, is there? Was Mother a sweet soul, Father? Linda, if you're not happy here why don't you go away? I'll be glad if next month you take a maid and a companion... ...and take a trip somewhere. You distress me. You cause nothing but trouble and upsets. That's just what I'm going to do. - No maid and no companion. Just me. - As you wish. I've been dying to get out for years. I've never known it so well as tonight. I can't stand it here any longer. It's doing terrible things to me. And now will you leave this room, please? This room. This room. I don't think you'll be able to stand it long. I'll come back when you've left it. I don't believe I need to worry about the way you'll take care of Julia, need I? We'll try to manage, thanks, sir. Seton has told us of your very successful manipulations of Seaboard. I consider that a very fine piece of work. I congratulate you. Isn't it marvellous? What a New Year. When you return from your honeymoon if I'm not much mistaken... ...there'll be a desk waiting for you at the bank. That's very kind of you, sir... ...but the success of the Seaboard deal makes possible a certain plan of my own. But, Johnny... A plan? Yes? I'm afraid I'm not quite as anxious as I might be for the things most people work towards. I don't want too much money. - Too much money? - Well, more than I need to live by. It's been my idea to make a few thousands early in the game... ...and then quit for as long as it lasts and try to find out who I am and what goes on... ...now, while I'm young and feel good all the time. I'm sure Julia understands what I'm getting at, don't you, Julia? I'm not sure I do, Johnny. You wish to occupy yourself otherwise, is that it? Please don't make me feel guilty about it. Even if it is a fool idea that people dream about and then go flat on. Even if I find I've had enough of it in three months, I want it. If I let this chance go by, there'll never be another for me... ...so I don't think anyone will mind if I just have a go at it, will they, Julia? Will they, dear? - Father, let Johnny and me talk awhile. - Just a moment. In all my experience... Please, Father, it will be all right, I promise you. Case, it strikes me you chose a strange time to tell us this. A very strange time. - Father. - I see, sir. Then... Then perhaps... Father, please go down. We'll come in a minute. He didn't get what I was driving at, at all. Why did you do it? You knew all that talk would antagonize him. - You think talk is all it was? - I think it was less than that. I'm furious with you. It wasn't just talk, Julia. You don't realize what Father is offering you. Wait a minute, dear. - We'd better get clear on this. - I'm clear on it right now. If you think you can persuade me that a man of your energy... ...and your ability possibly could quit at 30... If you're tired and want a rest, why, we'll have it. Haven't you the remotest idea of what I'm after? Yes, Johnny, I know. But you haven't any idea yet of how exciting business can be. See it through. You'll love it. I know you will. There's no such thrill in the world as making money. Darling, you don't see what I'm aiming at either. Try a little blind faith for a while, won't you? - Come along with me? - But... No, the whole way, dear. Johnny, wait till next year or two years and we'll think about it again. You can do that for me, for us, can't you? You think by then I'd be a good sport... ...and come around, that's what you think, don't you? It lacks six minutes to the New Year if anyone's interested. Come on, Johnny. Have Nick and Susan gone? I don't know. They weren't in my room. - Perhaps they're downstairs. - Perhaps. Anyone care for a few cold cuts before the fun starts? Come? This is plain stubbornness and you know it. Listen, Julia. No, that gets you nowhere, does it? Are you coming? I think I'll wait a moment with Linda if you don't mind. But I do mind. Will you come, please? In a moment, Julia. You'd better run on down now, don't you think? Not right away. I'm afraid I won't know how to entertain you. I've done all my stuff. I don't need entertaining. You wouldn't care to step into a waltz as the old year dies, would you, Mr. Case? Yes, I would. I'd love it. There's a conspiracy against you and me, child. What's that? - The vested interests. - I know. They won't let you have any fun and they won't give me time to think. I suppose like the fathead you are, you told Father all your little hopes and dreams? Pretty disappointing? - Bad enough. - Poor boy. What about your own evening? Not so hot either. Poor girl. - Of course, they may be right. - Don't you believe it. I don't know. They seem so awfully sure. It's still your ride, isn't it? You know where you want to go, don't you? - I thought I did. - So did I. Pathetic, wasn't it, all my fuss and fury over anything as unimportant as this party. Maybe it is important. Well, if it is, I'm not, and I guess that's the answer. Linda, you're so sweet. Thanks, that's enough. It was grand. Listen. That's it, all right. Happy New Year, Johnny. Happy New Year, Linda. You can count on sister Linda, Johnny. Run on down now. They'll be waiting. Linda. What? They've... - Your father put me in a position... - Johnny, do you love Julia? Of course I do. Well, if ever she needed you, she needs you now. You're all that's left. Go on, Johnny. Happy New Year. Same to you. - What's it like to get drunk, Ned? - It's... How drunk? Good and drunk. Grand. How is it? Well, to begin with it brings you to life. Does it? And after a while you begin to know all about it. You feel, I don't know, important. That must be good. It is. And then pretty soon the game starts. What game? A swell game, a terribly exciting game. You think clear as crystal... ...but every move, every sentence is a problem. That gets pretty interesting. - You get beaten though, don't you? - Sure, but that's good, too. Then you don't mind anything, not anything at all. Then you sleep. How long can you keep it up? A long while. As long as you last. Ned, that's awful. Think so? Other things are worse. Where do you end up? Where does everybody end up? You die. And that's all right, too. Ned, can you do it on champagne? Why? What's the matter, Linda? Nothing. - I know. - Yes? Johnny. Give me some more wine, Ned. - He's in a spot, isn't he? - Give me some, Ned. You can tell me about it, dear. I love the boy, Neddie. I thought so. Great, isn't it? Great. Here's luck to you. I don't want any luck. Ladies and gentlemen, my good friends, I have the honour to announce to you... ...the engagement of my daughter Julia to Mr. John Case. An event which doubles the pleasure I take in wishing you and them... ...a most happy and prosperous New Year. So happy together. Congratulations. Ned. Poor lamb. - Aren't you thrilled? Isn't it... - I am. - I'm sure you'll be very happy. - You're thinking of my sister. - What? - Not I! My sister. Linda, now you must get married yourself. - Thank you. - I'm so happy for you. Thank you for coming down. You must go back to bed. The doctor said you shouldn't excite yourself. What is this? Where's the lucky boy? I haven't seen the lucky boy since the announcement. - Linda, did you know about it? - Of course I did. - Where is he? - That's something I wouldn't know. I don't know. He wanted to argue with Father. He didn't make sense. He said things to Father he had no right to say. Then after the announcement to go downstairs and leave us. It's horrible. Please don't be so upset. I'll find him and bring him back. Then everything will be fine. Of all times... - Linda, isn't it too marvellous? - Too, too marvellous. I'll... - Linda, now you must get married. - I hope I shall. Linda needs to find a husband. - Hello. It is wonderful, isn't it? - It's simply lovely. - Hello. How's Baltimore? - It's fine, thank you. - Have you seen Mr. Case anywhere? - Mr. Case went through here a moment ago. Through there? - Did Mr. Case come in here? - Yes, ma'am, right through here, ma'am. "Happy New Year," he says. Congratulations to Miss Julia, ma'am. Thank you. - Linda. Come in. - Hello, Susan. I'm sorry to butt in. Well, as I live. Look, it's the acrobat lady. - Glad to see you. - Glad to see you, too. Run to the drug store and get some champagne. - I tried to call. - The phone's been discontinued. We pay our bills. It's that we're planning a little trip. - You're sailing? - Tonight. Come on in and help us pack. The university gave me leave to work in France. And we're doing our best... You ought to have some tea or something. You look peaked. I've been hunting for Johnny. I thought he'd be here. Have you seen him? Not since that night. - You knew he walked out. - Yes. He came here and we talked until New Year's noon. Then he left town to think things over. - His letter said he'd be back today. - Then I can see him! He's probably on his way. Hasn't your sister heard from him? If she has, she hasn't told me. - You love her a great deal, don't you? - Yes. A lot of good that does. Can't you see that if she feels as your father does... Johnny'll fix that. Johnny'll fix everything. If I could only make Julia and Father listen to me. I've got to. Johnny's so sweet, he's so attractive. What's the matter with the girl anyway? She ought to know by now that men like Johnny don't grow on every bush. Linda, isn't it just possible that the things we like in Johnny... ...may be the very things she can't stand? The fate that you feel he'll save her from is the one fate in this whole world she wants? I don't believe that. Even so, she loves him and there's been a break. Wouldn't you think she'd be woman enough to hang on? Yes, if she loves him. Julia has never in her life loved anyone but Johnny. - Perhaps herself. - That's not true. Even in this, it's of him she's thinking, she may be mistaken, but it is of him. You don't know how a girl in love feels. - We're sorry, Linda, really. - No, you're not. You're... What's the matter with me anyway? Even if I told you what was the matter with you, you wouldn't admit it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Pay no attention to her. If you did anything else then you wouldn't be what you are. Which to my professorial mind is head of the class. - I love you two. - And so do we love you. In our rough, uncouth way, of course. - Johnny is seeing your sister this afternoon. - Yes? He's asking her to sail with us and with him tonight. - What do you think she'll say? - Yes. What if she doesn't? What happens then? What's Johnny to do? What would you want him to do? That may be he. Nicholas Porter? The name is Potter, but don't let it bother you. Thanks. Julia will sail, she must, she's got to. Good-bye. Julia. Hello, dear. You'll be late for the Todds' dinner, won't you? You had luncheon with Johnny. He wants you to sail tonight. - You've seen him? - The Potters told me. You must sail with him. - The Potters? Who are the Potters? - Stop it, Julia. - Stop what? - Pretending you don't care. You're taking my little difficulty more seriously than I am. Don't let Johnny go off tonight and make a hash of both your lives. You can't let him sail alone. He's no more sailing than you are. Does Father know you aren't going to the Todds' dinner? Why do you want to shut me out in the cold like this? I wasn't aware that I was. Won't you just talk to me? Please, Julia. If there's been any shutting out done, it's you who've done it. Me? Johnny and I have had a difference and you're siding with him, aren't you? But he's right. - He's right for you as well as for himself. - I think that's for me to decide. - Not Father? - Father has nothing to do with it. He happens to agree with me where you don't. But... But we've always agreed before, always. No. I think quite often I've given in, in order to avoid scenes and upsets and... Is that true, Julia? You've always been the stronger character. At least people have always thought so. You've made the decisions and had the ideas. And you've been resenting me. I can't believe it. It's nothing to get into a stew about. I didn't say I resented you. You've been an immense help often. When it comes to determining my future and the future of the man I'm going to marry... Your future, Julia? What do you want, just security? Sit back smugly in your bank vault among the worthies of the world? One thing I don't want is to start this endless discussion all over again. You've only 20 minutes in which to dress. Linda, did you hear me? Father, I think you're both giving Johnny the rottenest kind of a deal. - In what way? - In every way. - You're not thinking of what's best for him. - On the contrary. The young man's outlook has merely become somewhat confused. - You'll straighten it out for him. - We shall try. But why hasn't he the right to live part of his life as he wants to? Linda, I should like to understand what he and you are aiming at... ...but I confess, I cannot. I consider his whole attitude un-American. - Are you serious? - Entirely. Then he is and he won't go to Heaven when he dies. He can't believe a life devoted to piling up money is all it's cracked up to be. Strange, isn't it, when he has us right before his eyes for such a shining example? I listened most attentively the other day to our young dreamer... ...and I still must confess that the talk of the two of you... ...seems to me of the 17-year-old variety. I'm glad if it is. We're grand at 17. It's after that, that sickness sets in. Well, I feel very well myself. You both think he'll come around. Compromise, anyway. You'll get fooled. He won't give way one inch. - Stubborn? - No, right and knows he's right. What's the matter, kid? I can't believe it, Ned. Johnny's clearing out. He's sailing tonight and Julia won't lift a finger to stop him. I don't understand her. Most people, including Johnny and yourself, make a big mistake about Julia. They're taken in by her looks. At bottom she's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself... ...is the life she belongs in. You've just never hit it off, that's all. - Ned. - What? You remember what we talked about on New Year's Eve? Sure, I remember. - Tell me something. - Sure. Does it stand out all over me? Why? Nick and Susan, this afternoon. I think they got it. Anyone who loves you would, Linda. That's awful. I'm so ashamed. I'm not, though. Why should you be? Pardon me, Miss Linda. - Yes, Henry. - Mr. Case is downstairs. Have him come up, will you, Henry? And, Henry, tell Miss Julia. He'll be up in a minute. Are you sure you want to get over him? No, I'm not and that's what scares me most. I feel alive and I love it. I feel at last something's happening to me. But it can't get anywhere so it's like living on that stuff. - I've got to get over it. - Because it seems so hopeless, is that it? Seems? What do you mean? Don't you know? Let me tell you something. You're twice as attractive as Julia ever thought of being. You've got twice the looks, twice the mind and 10 times the quality. You could charm a bird off a tree if you would and why not? If you were in her way she'd ride you down like a rabbit. How could you, Ned, knowing the way she loves him? - How could you? - All right, Linda. Tell him hello for me, will you? - Hello, Linda. - Hello, Johnny. I sent for Julia. I feel as if I'd been away quite a while. Yeah. - I went to Placid. - I see. It was... - It was horrible there. - I can imagine. - I'm going to take that job at the bank. - I see. Only for a while, only for a couple of years. Just until I can get it through to her that... It was what she asked and after all, a couple of years isn't a lifetime. - Is it? - Of course not. - I think everything will be all right, Johnny. - Sure. I can see the way they feel about it. I could hardly expect them to do a complete, sudden about-face but... But, hang it, why can't they see what I'm getting at? Perhaps eventually they will. That's what I'm counting on. Linda... ...you agree there's only one thing for me to do now, don't you? Compromise? Yes. Yes. You think that's right, don't you? - I don't think it matters a bit what I think. - It does though, Linda. You think it's right, don't you? Say you think it's right. Johnny, when two people love each other as much as you do... ...anything that keeps them apart must be wrong. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. They tell me you've been away. Pleasant having you back. It's pleasant to be back. There's been a rather noticeable absence of snow these recent weeks. Quite. Father, Johnny came tonight to see Julia. That doesn't surprise me a great deal, Daughter, not a great deal. Julia, not you and me. Come on, Dada, let's go bye-bye. Good evening, Johnny. - Get your coat, darling, we're going out. - Yes, dear. Father, could you explain to the Todds? Please, close the door. I wish to speak with you both. You insist on putting me into a position that I don't in the least relish. Who's there? Come in, Ned. - Sorry. I just thought that... - Come in. Sit down, Son. Coming between two young people in love is furthest from my wish or intention. For love, true love, is a very rare and beautiful thing. Where are you going? Please, sit down. And I believe that its path... ...that is to say the course of true love, contrary to the adage, should run smooth. I am a man of 58 years and speak from a long experience and observation. It is of paramount importance... - I beg your pardon, sir? - Yes? If that position at the bank is still open I'll be glad to take it. I'm still not convinced. I still don't believe in it, but it's what Julia wishes and... And I'm glad to defer to her wish. - You're not convinced, you say? - Would you like me to lie to you, sir? Father, it's enough for me. Julia said a year or two. I'll do everything I can to make a success of it. I have only one reservation. Lf, at the end of that time, I still think it's wise for me to quit... ...there won't be any objections. - I doubt there'll be reason for any. We shall have to see about that. Well, Father? - When is it you wish to be married? - As soon as possible. Now the sun shines once more and we're all friends again. And now what are your plans for your wedding trip, may I ask? - We haven't any definite... - It's wise to prearrange honeymoons. Now let me suggest a little itinerary. You will land at Plymouth or Southampton and proceed straight to London. I shall cable my sister tomorrow. They will be delighted to have you stay with them. He is one of the most important men in British banking circles. You could scarcely go abroad and not stop with your Aunt Helen, Julia. In addition it will save hotel expenses and Johnny can learn some British methods. Then I'll cable the Bovays in Paris. He's expert adviser to the Minister of Finance. A valuable man for you to know. I had thought of this as a honeymoon more than a business trip, sir. There's no harm in combining a little business with pleasure. I've never found there was. They have a lovely place, Johnny, just outside of Paris. Now a week in London, a week in Paris, 10 days in the South of France, ideal. Then you could sail from Genoa and return by southern route. I'll arrange to have your house ready for you March 1. Thanks, darling. What house is that, Julia? Father's lending us a place on 64th Street. Wait till you see it. This is not to be a gift you know, not yet. After you've occupied it for some time... ...my hard old heart may soften. Listen to him, his hard old heart. Would you also arrange for the servants? Julia, I'm sorry but I can't stand it. Would you mind telling me what you mean? I thought this was a trial for a couple of years. If we begin with possessions and obligations... ...we could never get out from under them. No! No. You've been extremely kind and generous, but it's not for us. - But you... You said that... - I'm back where I was, Julia. I can see now it's got to be a clean break, it's simply got to. We've got to make our own life, there's nothing to it if we don't. There's no other way to live it. Forget about wedding invitations and all the rest of it. Let's get married tonight. - I must decide now, must I? - Please. And if I say no? I'm going tonight by myself. Very well then. You can go. I suppose the fact is I love feeling free even better than I love you, Julia. Good-bye, sir. I'm sorry we couldn't make a go of it. Thanks for trying anyway. Good-bye to you, Linda. You've been sweet. Good-bye, Johnny. I hope you find what you're looking for. I hope you do. Linda. Please, do. Good-bye, Ned. I'll miss that man. He's gone. - Yes, and in my opinion... - Good riddance. - He's really gone. - Never mind. He loves you, he'll be back. Be back? "Be back," did you say? What do you think I am? I hope this experience, hard as it may have been... Don't worry about me. I'm all right. Even a little more than all right, I should say. - What's with you? Will you kindly... - You don't love him. Answer me. Do you or not? - What's that to you? - You don't, do you? It's written all over you. You're relieved he's gone. - Suppose I am? - She asks me, suppose she is! - Are you? Say it. - I'm so relieved I could sing with it. - Is that what you want? - Yes, thanks. Neddie, Neddie, have I got a job now. Is your passport in order? Mine is. What do you say? - Well, when? - Now. Tonight. - I don't think I could. - Sure you could. If I can, you can. - Where are you off to? - Will you come? - Where are you going? - On a trip. On a big ride. Do you mind? Will you come, Ned? - Listen, Father... - A trip now is out of the question. - You won't. - Can't. - Caught? - Maybe. - I'll be back for you, Ned. - I'll be here. You've got no faith in Johnny, have you? His little dream may fall flat, you think. What if it should? There will be another. I've got faith in Johnny. Whatever he does is all right with me. If he wants to dream for a while, he can... ...and if he wants to come back and sell peanuts, how I'll believe in those peanuts. Good-bye, Julia. Good-bye, Father. - Good-bye, Neddie. - Good-bye, kid. Good luck. Never you fear, I'll be back for you, my fine bucko. All right. Linda. Try and stop me, someone. Please someone try and stop me. I shall not permit it. I shall... - Permit Linda? Don't make me laugh. - She's going with him, isn't she? Isn't she? - Going to get her Johnny. - A fine chance she's got. Any bets? Any bets, Julia? To Linda. And while we're at it, Grandfather. Dear, what a trip this might have been with Johnny along. Will you please stop it, Nick? I can't stop it, Susan. I'm miserable. Thinking of him I should say. - Shut up, dearest. - For two cents, I'd call off the whole thing. - Johnny. - Johnny. My word. - Where's Julia? - I left her sitting on her golden throne. - Johnny is taking the big ride by himself. - No. Boy, champagne, any amount of it, but hurry. - Oui, Monsieur Porter. - The name is Potter. Let's change our name to Porter. Then they'll call us Potter. What happened? I've just wakened out of a nightmare. Everything will be all right. I know it is. Come on, children, come on. Is this where the club meets? Right here.
