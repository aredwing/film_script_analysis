No, I'll come pick it up on Thursday, man. Don't worry about it. Can you help me? Wait, say that again? It won't work. Uh-huh. Well...I told him that. Yeah, all right. Perfect. I'll see you then. Thanks. Got it? I'll fix that later. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. Are you almost finished? Yeah. Have you seen my router anywhere? Your router? Yeah. I think there's one in the garage. In the garage? In the garage. All right. Come on, Tiny. It's gonna be great when it's done. Yeah. Yeah? I like having you here with me, though. I like being here. You mind if I set up a workspace in the garage? No, of course not. It's what it's for. Saw most of your dad's stuff's in there. I didn't want to start throwing it all out. Just get rid of it. I just..I haven't gotten around to it. All right. Happy birthday. Thank you. You're welcome. It's beautiful. It's perfect. That's good. Is that good? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing, I just lost it. Do you want me to go down on you? Yeah. Hello. Kaia, hey. Hi, it's me. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. What's wrong, Chris? Sorry, I know it's late, but I was wondering if you could pick me up. Pick you up where? Train station. # In my heart # In my heart # Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart # Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart # In my heart # Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart # In my heart # In my heart # Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart # Lord I want # In my heart # Lord, I want to be more loving in my heart # In my heart # Can you turn the heat on? Yeah. I hope I didn't wake you. Sorry for calling so late. It's all right. I was up. It was my birthday. Gah. Yes, fuck. Happy birthday. Guess what. You're gonna be an aunt. What? I'm pregnant. What? Nothing. Jesus, Chris. Be quiet. My boyfriend is sleeping. You have a boyfriend? That's crazy. Yeah. Kaia? I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you. It's all right. This is my sister, Christine. Hi. Hi, I'm Andrew. Nice to meet you. I'm very sorry for waking you. Kaia, I'm really cold. I'm gonna take a shower. Okay, go ahead. What's going on? Is she okay? I don't know. I just picked her up at the train station. You go back to sleep. I'll talk to her for a second. All right. Hey, Kai. What? I need to call my fiance. You're engaged too? Yeah. Actually I need to call him and tell him where I am. And you're gonna love him. What's going on, Chris? His name is Ira. He'll make a great dad. Are you taking anything now? No, but just because it's bad for the baby. Okay. I don't know if you want to come pick her up, but if I don't hear from you by tomorrow morning, I'll bring her back to Boston. My number is 860-581-9826. 860-581-9826. Thanks. Fuck, Chris. I couldn't find you. You're sleeping in dad's room? You went in there? Yeah, well, nice touches, Kaia. It looks sweet in there. Don't worry. I didn't wake him. It doesn't work. What do you need? I don't know how we used to sleep alone up here. I'm not used to it. Are you afraid? Kind of, yeah. Listen. I'm really sorry. Yeah, well, you're not forgiven. I know that. I know that, but right now, I need you to be nice with me. So he's nice, huh? Ira? Yeah. He's great. I love him. He's a little different from me. He works at the UN. With what? Something to do with human rights in Grozny or something. Sounds kind of honourable. I don't really understand it. Me neither. Look, I'm here now. I'm gonna make it right between us. Come here. You can be such a child, Chris. 'Cause you're a good mommy. Me too. - Hey. - Ah. I'm making pancakes. Hope that's okay. It's the only thing I know how to make. Yeah, no, nice. Where's Kaia? She's sleeping in my room. We had a late night, so I figured she should sleep in. All right, well, I'll go wake her up then. Sure. Tell her breakfast is ready. All right. You, uh-you have a different accent. Yeah. Different moms. My dad and I lived everywhere. You didn't know that? Oh, no, I knew that. I just... I forgot. Still asleep. She doesn't really talk about me much, huh? Uh, no, it's not that. I just forgot. All right. Morning. Why are you sleeping in here? Sorry. We were talking, and I fell asleep. Mm. Okay. Um, what's she doing here? Apparently she's pregnant and engaged to some guy. - Really? - Mm-hmm. So, what, she just showed up? Come here. It's so weird that that's your sister. How far along is she? 14 weeks. She's not taking care of herself. She's too skinny. Well, she's downstairs making pancakes now. It's the only thing she knows how to make. Mm. - Hi. - Hi. - Kaia? - Yeah. - Ira, right? - Yeah. Thanks a lot for calling me. Is Chris here? Yeah, she is. - Hi. - Oh, hey. - Andrew. - Ira. Nice to meet you. Nice car. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, come in. She's in the kitchen. I'm really sorry about her just showing up here like this. She does this sometimes. Yeah, I'm used to it. It's not the best behaviour. I guess we'll have to start tying her up. The kitchen is... To the right. You guys are fixing up the house, huh? Did your dad draw it? It's from the 1920's. It's by my dad's favourite architect. Okay. It'll probably be worth a lot when it's all done. Well, no, we don't plan on selling it. - Hi. - Hey. You're here. Yeah. Long drive up here, babe. I had to tell Kaia about the baby. Sorry. Congratulations. Thanks. It's good news, huh? Mm-hmm. Couldn't you wait to come up here in the morning, though? You scared the shit out of me. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terrible. Kaia called you, right? Yeah. That's not the point. You can't keep doing this to me, honey. Or we have to tie you up. All right. Well, thank you, guys, for calling me. It was nice to finally meet you. You want to get your stuff? Ready to go? Hold on. I made breakfast. Yes, you did. I'll have two, if you eat one. - Oh. - Come on. She's just like you. She can't eat in the morning. Then I want apple jam. Jam? On pancakes? Yeah, it's a Scandinavian thing. It's awful. It was Kaia's birthday yesterday. I was thinking that we could stay. Oh- I'm never around for your birthday. I thought it might be nice if we all had dinner together. Well, we should probably head back, babe. Yeah, I'm not really up for another celebration. See? There you go. Why don't we plan on coming up here another time? Come on, Kaia. It'll be nice. Well, aren't we keeping Ira from anything? Well, it's the weekend. Yeah, but I.. I brought you your dress. We have tickets for the SPS benefit tonight. Well, give them to your mother or someone. You hate those things. Well, that sounds more fun than sticking around here. No, no, no, no. Actually it doesn't. It's the donation that matters, anyway. It's just that people usually expect to see me there, but I can miss it for once. The only problem is, I didn't bring anything to wear. Well, you can wear me. Wear you? All right. Maybe I'll just run to the shop instead. But, uh... Um, are you guys sure that we're not intruding? - Of course not. - Not at all. It's gonna be great. Ira's a good cook. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I'm not bad. What? I don't get a kiss? I missed you. Mmm. Can I steal you for a sec? Just for a sec. Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys. It's nice to be here. Thanks for having us. - Sure. - Of course. So how are you feeling? I'm okay, babe. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, listen. I, uh... I thought you didn't want to tell anyone about the baby until we were sure. Yeah, I know. I know, but... Isn't Kaia great? Yeah, of course, but... I mean, honey, she's my only family. I want you to get to know her. All right, listen, we'll stay for the night, but then we leave in the morning, okay? Say, "I understand". I understand. Let me show you my old room. Yeah. Oh, it's pretty in here. You're pretty. Oh, yeah? Am I? Pretty much thought you'd packed your bags and left me this morning. Nope. Take my panties off. What are you doing? Honey, they... Don't worry about them. They'll be fine. Give in. I missed you. Yeah? Come here. Leave them there. Come here. Turn over. Is this okay? It's actually nice to see her. Yeah, I wish the circumstances were a little less weird, but... I'd like to get to know her. Well, it looks like he can take care of her. He seems a little arrogant or something, right? You just don't like him because he's rich. Maybe you should tell them to come another time. When the house is more done, it's nicer. What? I'm not gonna go back and say, "Oh, hey, look, we thought about it for a second, and actually you should leave". Yes. Tell me when you're gonna cum. I want you to cum in my mouth. Shh. Hey. Hey, stop that. What are you doing? Hey. What the fuck are you doing? You okay? Jesus. I'm fine. I'm fine. Where's the bathroom? And I was mad at her for a long time. You know, she didn't help me at all when he got sick. You know, we used to be really, really close. Yeah. I know. All right. Just be nice to her, okay? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. About this other tiny person inside of you. Your boy is cute. Yeah, I think so too. Tell me about him. What's his deal? What's he do? Mainly construction. I feel like I remember seeing him in school. He dropped out of high school. Had a hard time until dad hired him. Didn't he go to jail for something? Once. What for? Come on, what is it? He hit his girlfriend when he was drunk. What? Of course he shouldn't have done it, but there's more to the story. He was a kid. Well, doesn't that worry you a little bit? No, absolutely not. He'd never hurt me. Well... I just can't believe that you have a boyfriend. This is good. Look it! Stop! Are you gonna dance for me tonight? I miss your old moves. I don't dance like that. I assure you that you did. I mean, he had on these knee-high black boots, but I was wearing sandals. So I asked him if he'd be upset if I waited in the car, and he seemed sort of offended, so I just went along with it. Then he smiled and said, "Don't look to your right." But I did, and there was this big ditch filled with coral snakes. And suddenly I felt one crawling up my leg. I had a sharp pain, my water broke, and I gave birth. I always dream about snakes when I'm nervous about something. Really? I think that folks place a little too much significance on the importance of dreams. I mean, they even seem to grant them some kind of supernatural fortune-telling quality, and I don't mean to say that they're completely meaningless, babe, but they do usually just reflect whatever's been on your mind. No. I believe that everything happens for a reason. Me too. I don't believe in that shit. Well, dad had this old book that he used to look at with us. Do you remember? Yeah. Wasn't much for picture books, was he? God, he was like 100 years old. Why were you in Oslo? Oh, I was just there for work. I'd like to go back. Yeah, you should. I want to take Andrew next summer. Yep. Oh, you'll love it, dude. It's beautiful. I'm sure. She told me. You had the cutest little accent. God, I was so jealous of you. Is your mom still there? Hmm, I don't know. Hmm. She's hard to keep track of. She was a pretty troubled lady. I'm sorry to hear that. I know what you mean, though. My mother's a lot of work, especially after my dad died. What are you talking about? Your mom's fine; her mom's a drug addict. That's why she came here, so we could take care of each other, since our parents are total fuck-ups. Well, I think he must have been a decent enough guy, to be able to take care of two girls alone. Yeah, he was. What are you talking about, Chris? He was crazy about you. No, Kaia. He was crazy about you because you never opened your mouth. Shut up. I was shy. Well, you were a bad kid like me, weren't you, Andrew? Oh, you..you remember me? Yeah, I certainly do. Do you remember me? Yeah, I guess I do, yeah. What? You grew up here too? Yep. Born and raised. I wasn't that bad, though. I just liked practical jokes. Yeah, like what? Mm, I don't know..gross stuff. It's probably not the best dinner conversation. Then we'll save it for after dinner. No, come on. Tell us. We don't care. Uh, well, hmm. Let's see. I played lacrosse growing up. Oh, yeah? They play that out here? Yeah, they do. And we weren't very good, but we were playing a good game, and I was getting lucky. And there was this guy on the team, Eric Lundin. You remember him? Lundin? - Totally. - You don't? Well, he was a prick, anyway. So what about him? Well, he fucked up a pass or something like that during the game. And he was the kind of guy that was always giving everyone else shit for what they did. And so for once, he fucked up. Hmm. And so after the game, we all hid in the gym, and he came out, and everybody ran up, and they grabbed him, and they pulled his pants down. And I went, and I got my lacrosse stick, and I managed to get the lacrosse stick in his ass. And then my buddy came over. And he put the ball in the lacrosse stick and then managed to throw it in the net and score, with the stick still in his ass. Nice. I'm sorry, but isn't that basically rape? What? No. We were kids. We did shit like that all the time. Oh, okay. Did it happen to you, Andrew? Not that, but the same kind of shit happened, yeah. I mean, that guy and I, we're still friends. I think you were right the first time. He was a prick, and I think he got what was coming to him. Thank you. So we're Eskimo brothers. I fucked him too. What? Thanks for sharing, Chris. Guys, I mean, come on. That was a long time ago. That guy probably works in a gas station now. And what's wrong with that if he does? I think we got it. Everybody does stupid things when they're kids. Yeah, they certainly do. Watch the wine, babe. I didn't know that you two had gotten, you know, so close growing up. Yeah. What happened? I moved. Oh, I know, but what happened more specifically? Why did you stop talking? Well, you know what happened. Why are you bringing this up? I was just curious what Christine had to say. Why? All right, let's rewind a little bit. I'll clean up. No, I can do that. Help me get the cake, hon? Hey, what you doing over here? Should you be drinking? I've only had one glass, dad. Okay. So I used to see you around. Did you and I ever... What? Ever... No. Good. Yeah. I was trying to remember. That would be awkward. Yeah, it would be. So how did you and my sis hook up? Well, your father introduced us. Yeah. I was lucky to have gotten to work with him, even briefly. Yeah. He was a hard-ass. But he knew what he wanted. I know it doesn't look like much, but... the ideas that he had for the renovation, they're all really solid. It's just the guts of the house that don't work, the electrical stuff, you know. We don't want another fire here. She told you it was an electrical problem? It's not true. I started the fire. All right. You want to dance? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if you can keep up with me, to be honest. To be honest, we won't know unless we try. Come on. All right, all right, I'm getting up. Help me find more wine? Mm-hmm. I got the spins. Come here. I feel like I'm in college. I'm gonna go to bed. Yeah? Okay. I'll be up in a sec. Your sister's kind of nuts, by the way. She told me that she started the fire in the garage. Is that true? She's not nuts. Why the hell did you tell me that it was an electrical fire? I've been rewiring this whole house, for Christ's sake. She did all kinds of crazy shit when I moved in with them. Like, she didn't want to share her dad with a stranger. What are you talking about? She didn't mean to hurt me. Look, we are in a relationship. Mm-hmm. You are supposed to share things with me. You're not supposed to choose what you share and what you don't share. Share. You told me that you burned yourself, Kai. Yeah, I kind of did. I was trying to get her out of there. Yeah. Yeah. So you're a liar? - Mm-mm. - No? Mm-mm. You want to share? Let's share. What's up with that stupid story in there? It made you seem horrible. Why are you talking so close to me? Well, why are you so close to me? Tell me. What? Well, what..what.. why the fuck did you even bring up that story? Oh, come on. What are you.. I was a kid. And that..what, that asshole calling me a rapist? Are you kidding me? I'll fucking show him a rapist. I'm gonna put my dick in his mouth. - Dude. - Hard. That's called humour. Humour. Yeah, all right. Forget it. I'm sorry. I'm drunk. I'm drunk. Let's go have fun... - Yeah. - With everyone. Let's have fun. I'm all right. Yeah? Go ahead. After you, Princess Leia. # After you've gone # And left me crying # After you've gone # There's no denying # You'll feel blue # You'll feel sad # You'll miss the only pal # You've ever had # There comes a time # Don't forget it # There'll come a time # When you'll regret it # Some day when you'll grow lonely # Your heart will break like mine # And you'll want me only # Babe? # After you've gone # Babe? # Gone away # Honey? # After you've gone # After the breakup # After you've gone # You're gonna wake up # I think she's sleepwalking. I'll be right back. I'm gonna go try and put her to bed. # Come and change your mind # After the years # What the fuck was that? Don't worry about that. Don't worry about that? She sleepwalks. Hey, there. - Hi. - Morning. Sorry, I look like shit. No, you don't. How did you sleep? I slept okay. Thanks for having us, by the way. It's really nice for her. It's not a problem. Where is she? She's still sleeping. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm really sorry about last night. Hey, don't worry about it. You're great with her. It's good. You don't get mad. Yeah, well, there's no use in getting mad, is there? I don't know. I never tried it. Have you tried spanking her? Sorry, what's that? That was a joke. That was a really weird joke. I'm so hungover. I have no idea why I said that. It's okay. Hey, um... Listen, I have some time before I have to leave for Grozny. And I can do some work from home for a few days. What are you doing in Grozny? We're monitoring the elections there. Ah. Listen, she's been a little all over the place lately. Lately? A little more than usual. You know she went off her medication, right? Yeah, 'cause it's bad for the baby, no? Yeah, yeah, I know. It's just..seems like it's good for her to be close to you right now. And I, um... I don't want to impose in any way. If it's okay with you and Andrew, I'd like us to stay for a few more days. Yeah, of course. Of course. Are you sure? Yeah, it's not a problem, really. Please stay. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah. Hey. So, what, they're staying? I'm sorry about that. He kind of just invited himself. I have to go and pick up some dresses from an estate sale. Christine and I are heading into town. You need anything? No, I'm good. Okay. - Hey, wait. - What? Come here. Come here. Look, I've got to say something. To me, it seem like she changes you. What do you mean? Staying like this. Why? It's like she's trying to win you back. So? So it's not gonna be a drinking party every day up here. We have a lot of work to do. They're gonna help out at all? I'm not gonna put them to work. What the fuck are they gonna do? Look, this is where she grew up. She has the right to stay. Come on, last night? Yeah, I know. Yeah. But you just don't like her. Oh, no, she's fucking awesome. Coming downstairs, prancing around in her fucking underwear. - Hey. - Ooh. Hey, she's my sister. This is my house. I'm going to lunch. - Pretty low, Kai. - Yeah. It's not like I'm breaking my fucking back out here or anything. Wait here. - Hi. - Hi. I called about the clothes. Yes. I'm really sorry for your loss. Thanks. I just looked around a little. Nothing's changed. No, it hasn't. I'm really sorry that I hurt you. I saw you out by the garage the other morning. You know you've never really let me see it? It's not so much to look at. Can I? It's not so bad, Kai. You know, I've always imagined that it was so much worse. Yeah? Well, you've seen between my thighs, right, where they pulled the skin for it? Well, I didn't..I didn't mean it like that. Guys fucking love it. If second base didn't freak them out enough, just wait until they take my pants off. Jesus. I really didn't mean it like that. I just-I didn't expect it to come out like that. I was trying to say that you are beautiful, and I expected it to be even worse. God, man, Kaia, I don't want you to be mad at me anymore. Kaia. I came here to make amends. Well, I'm fine. And Andrew doesn't mind. I'm very happy and very lucky to have him. I think it's the other way around. He doesn't deserve you. How the hell do you know what I deserve, huh? Hey there, pal. Something to nurse the hangover? Oh, no. I don't like to drink when I work. Okay, fair enough. Need any help? Yeah, you want to give me a hand with this? Sure. Where are we putting this thing? Just out front. I'll bring it to the dump in a few days. All right. - Ooh. - Got it? Yeah. All right, watch your step. So Kaia's shop must do pretty well, huh? Really seems to be coming along, the house. Yeah, well, it's her father's money. But she does good, yeah. She told me that you want to be an architect? It'll probably be worth a lot when it's all done..this. Yeah, you said that already. What is it that you do again, Ira? I studied political science in Paris, but I just started working as a human rights officer at the UN. All right. I figured I'd end up doing something a little bit more normal, but, you know... Yeah, now this is normal for you. Nah, not really. Fuck! Heavy motherfucker. Sorry about that. Hey, how did your father die? Plane crash. Oh, yeah. Those little planes are dangerous, huh? It was a commercial airliner. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, we were too. I got to say, you and Kaia, you don't seem to be treating this situation right. Christine, you mean? Yeah, Christine. Okay. And what would you suggest? Well, you know, you're well off. You can get her the best help that there is. Doesn't make sense to me that we're all just letting her go on and on and on and not doing nothing about it. Well, thanks for your concern, pal, but I think I got it under control. I remember Christine from growing up now. Doesn't seem like things have changed very much with her. That's funny, 'cause Chris told me that you went to jail when you were kids. Yeah, I did. Look, dude, I came out here to break the ice a little. Why are you being so hostile with me? Those two are family, which I guess makes us family, too, for now. Oh, yeah, no, we're family. I'm gonna go take a piss. Hey, do me a favour while you're out here. Make sure she doesn't burn the whole place down. Be a awful lot of work down the drain. Cool, brother. Good talk. - Stop the car. - What? Stop the car. What the hell is that doing out here? Andrew's cleaning out the garage. Yeah, who told him he could do that? I did. Why do you care? You just told me to knock it down. You want that stuff? Tell him to put it back. Why? It's my house too! Whatever he took out of there, you tell him to put it back! Jesus. What's going on now? Apparently it has some sentimental value to her. I'm sorry, dude. That couch does? Yeah. Jesus Christ. Christine. Christine, what are you doing? Christine, stop it. Stop it. Christine! Christine, stop it! Get her out of here! Get her away from me! I'm sorry. I'm up. What's going on? Hey, what's wrong with you? She walked into the room, and they started fighting. What happened? She was masturbating in our bedroom! All right. It's all right. Chris? Chris, I want to talk to you. Just a second, baby. - Hey. - Hey. She... She's not feeling so well today. Okay. Well, I really need to talk to her. Can you give her a sec? She's almost asleep. - Sure. - Okay. We'll see you in a bit. Still sleeping? Can I ask you something? Was your father ever abusive with you guys in any way? No. Why do you ask that? It's Chris. She just hates him so much. Well, that's not true. What, she never told you? Not that she hates him, no. So you guys got along, then? Yeah, he was fine. I mean, he was a little despondent, but he was nice with us. Despondent? Despondent how? Well, let's put it this way: Some years we'd celebrate Christmas and birthdays, and some years we wouldn't. Hmm. But there was always food on the table, and I had a really nice room all to myself. That's pretty different than the picture she painted. Yeah, well, that's bullshit. She got treated a lot better than me. Look, I don't know what she told you, but you've got to take Chris' stories with a grain of salt. Yeah. Yep, I know. She has a hard time separating her fictions from realities. I guess I just thought that the way he treated her maybe explained something. I'm grasping at straws here. Sorry that I asked. Despondent... Maybe depression just runs in the family, huh? Well, I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know you are. Would you take a walk with me? I'd like to ask you something. I'd like that, but I should head inside. Okay. Later then. - Morning. - Morning. You're up early. Yeah. I couldn't sleep. I had two fresh bags of cement out front. Did you move 'em anywhere? No. Those things weigh more than me. I don't know where they are. They still here? His car is here. They're just out, I guess. They weren't here when I woke up. Nice. Will you remind me to call my niece? Sure. We got to go up there some time. You'll love those kids. My brother, he's a great guy. I'd love to. I'm sure there's some good vintage spots up there you could check out, might find something good. Maybe I'll tell them Thanksgiving we'll spend with them.. Hey! What's wrong? Have you seen Chris? What? Have you seen Chris? No. She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. No, she wasn't with me when I woke up this morning. I went out to look for her. Doesn't she do this all the time? Huh? Christine! Christine! Christine! All right, everybody needs to calm down. She could have gone into town, or she could've gone back to the city. I checked my wallet. Normally when she disappears like this, she takes some money. Okay, Kaia, did you check yours? Kaia? No. Well, maybe you should. She didn't go for a walk, Andrew. Okay, don't talk to me like that. If you don't want to help, you don't have to. I'm helping, you idiot. All I'm saying is that yelling like we're looking for a fucking poodle is not the way to do it. Hey, can you not talk about her like that, please? We have to go back and get flashlights. I'll go. No, you stay. I'll go. Wait here with me. Christine! Christine! How far are we? It's not too far. Christine! This is where we go swimming. Oh, Christ. Come on, it's dark, Kai. We can come back in the morning. Let's go to the truck. We can go check into town. No, let's have a look. She might have gone around... - What are you doing? - You know, to the other side. What are you doing? Are you out of your fucking mind? Christine! Christine! All right. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on, it's fine. I'll come back in the morning, okay? It's dark out here. He's right. We can't see anything. Let's get into some warm clothes and drive into town. Fuck. Come on, I'll come back as soon as it's light out. Hey. Sorry, I was trying to be quiet. It's okay. I thought you were her. I can't sleep. I was gonna go back to the lake, take another look. I saw her out there the other night. What, at the lake? No, no. In here and then out front. I was following her. Kaia, what are you talking about? Well, she was walking in here, then over there. I didn't wake her up. I used to think that she was faking it or trying to tell me something. All right, but you know she's not, right? She's not conscious when she does that; she's asleep. Yes. But I don't understand it. Okay, don't worry. Come here. I think that we should go to the police today. But she always comes back. You okay? I don't feel so good. Okay. I need to sit down. Okay, come on, let's sit down. You're just tired. So am I. Hey. Hey, man. We went out looking at the lake. Me too. I woke up, seemed like everyone had disappeared all of a sudden. Yeah, I..I'm sorry that we were gone so long. She wasn't feeling well. Yeah. Yeah, you look like shit. You should get some sleep. Maybe Ira and I will head back to town, ask around at the train station. But she wasn't there. Well, I don't know. That was last night. Maybe she turned up. What do you think, Ira? Yeah, sure, let's head into town. I'll come too. No, it's fine. You stay here. The truck takes a little while to warm up. You mind starting it while I tuck her in? No, but why don't we just take mine? Great, even better. Come on. You'll feel better after a nap. Yeah, Andrew. You know how much I love you, right? Yeah. I love you too. Yeah. You know, there's one thing that I cannot accept, is, I do not like being disrespected. - I know. - Okay. You have your things from inside? What? Your stuff, you got everything? Yeah. All right, here's what's gonna happen: You're gonna go home. You can wait for Chris there. We'll go to the police, and we'll look for her out here. Okay, is that what Kaia wants? I'd prefer to stay here. I'm sure you would, but it's time for you to go. All right, well, I'd like to talk to her first. Listen. You have seriously overstepped your bounds in this house, bro. You walk around like you live here. You flirt with Kaia right in front of my face. Maybe that's why your slut girlfriend left you. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you fucking stupid? Are you fucking stupid? Hey, get your hands off me. - Are you fucking stupid? - Get your fucking hand off me. You talk to me like that again, I'm gonna fucking break your neck. - Get your hand off me. - All right? Motherfucker! Are you fucking serious? I will fucking kill you! I will fucking kill you! I will... You motherfucker. Huh? You motherfucker, put your hand down. Put your fucking hand down! I'm gonna hit you in your fucking face! Huh? I will fucking murder you! I will fucking murder you! What are you doing? Ira, God. You stupid motherfucker! Look at his face, Andrew! Look at his face! - Stop hitting me, Kai. - Hit me! This is my fault, so hit me! - Stop hitting me, Kai. - Hit me! You need to stop hitting me, Kai. Hit me! You need to stop. All right? Look, I'll leave. - I'll leave. - No. I'll wait outside. Are you sure you don't need me to call a doctor? I'm fine. I just want a shower. Okay. I'll get you something to wear from my father's closet. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I think I need to sleep a little. You should go to the police. No, I'll stay with you. If you have a concussion, it's not something to fool around with. I don't think I can sleep. You should get some rest. I'll keep an eye on you. Can I ask you something? What exactly did Chris say about our father? Not much. She just said that she couldn't stand him. That's all. That scares me. Mm. She said that he hit her once. Yeah. I was there. It was after she burned me. Oh, God. What are we gonna do? Okay. Sorry. Tell me a little bit more about your sister's sleep issues. Hello. Hello? Hello. Hey, it's me. Ira, hi. How are you? I... I'm okay. Yeah? I'm staying with my mother. Just dropped by her apartment for the first time today. It's weird being alone here. Yeah, I know. But I'll see you soon, right? Are you coming up? Yeah. Listen. The reason I'm calling is, I was going through all of our mail, and I found a letter from Chris. I've already called the police to let them know. What? What? Are you there? When did she send it? Well, that's the thing. The postmark is from before she disappeared. What does it say? I'm supposed to read it to you. So I think I'm just gonna pop in the car right now, all right? No, what does it say? It says... It says, uh... "Dear Ira, "Please read this to Kaia. "I'm currently writing you this from my old bedroom, "and it makes me so happy to hear "you and Kaia talking outside. I want you two to be friends. " It says that? Yeah. Should I keep going? Yes. "I want you two to be friends." "It's really important to me "that you two continue to get along "and take care of each other. "I can hear you saying something, and I don't know what you said, but it's making her laugh. " There's a smiley face. "I can see Andrew pulling everything "out of the garage from my window. "How could you let him do that? "I came back here to try and piece together "what happened to us there. "I am almost certain now "that I am not the one who burned you. "It's clear that you do not want to remember "what he did to us. "And I have to respect that. "So if I leave and I don't come back, please don't be mad, and don't go looking for me. " "You and Ira have each other now, and I have my little one to keep me company. " "I hope I don't change my mind, but I think I know where to go for now. " It stops there. Hey, are you there? Are you okay? Kaia? Listen. You have to tell me what happened. Kaia. You have to tell me what happened to you guys. Kaia?
