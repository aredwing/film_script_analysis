Morning. Morning. Marie, you've played concerts all over Europe this year as well as Belfast and here in Omagh, too. But what would you say has been the highlight of the summer? Without a doubt, Val, it's been a wonderful year for me musically, but the highlight has to be the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. That has to be the highlight for all of us. Come on, you lot, it's gone 9:00. I got it. Ah, Aiden, hang on. I have to get into town. Pack it in, you two. He's always at it, Da. Aiden, come on. I said we'd take Darra this afternoon. Give Sharon a wee break. It'll be lovely to see wee Darra. What time? She'll drop him up around 3:00 or 4:00. - Dad, are you all set? - Aye. I'll get it. - See you later, love. - Okay. - Bye. - Talk to you later, Mum. Aye, okay. Salad Bowl at 1:00. Oh, no, she's busy with the wean. Think we could look at your sister's car today? Think we're better things to be at. - Bye, everybody. - See you later. - Such a bleedin' carry on. - Yeah. So, where are youse going later? Head down to Sally's maybe. Go to the front bar. Good fun? Or what? Place is pumpin', like. Where do I start on this thing? She said she was having trouble with it overheating. She needs to get a new one. Aye. She doesn't listen to a word you say, though. Right. I'm away, Mummy. Okay, love. - Yeah, see you later. - See you later, love. - No, it's not moving, Da. - What? It's not moving. Here, try this one, son. Aye, that'll do there. It's a bit bigger than mine. No. No better, so it's not. - There you go. - Aye, give us that one there. Where did you get that, Da? In the old toolbox. - Give us another one. - That'll work. I got it, Da. There's a wee hole in the pipe here. Look. - See it there? - Oh, I see it, aye. A wee bit of welding will sort that out, sure. Is that Mike? Oh, no, we were to head into town. No, it's grand. I'll tell him to wait. No, you go on ahead. I can do this. - Are you sure, Dad? - Aye, aye, absolutely. Thanks. Will you bring up the welding equipment? - Yeah. - Good lad. - I'll see you later, Da. - See you later, son. - See you, Michael. - See you, Mike. Oh, if you're going up to the house, will you bring some milk? Aye, no bother. There's also gonna be a parade going down through the main town center past Market Street and Sudan Avenue, and the weather forecasts are looking great. All across the Province the weather is looking good. - All right, Mummy? - Ach, Aiden. I'm just heading up the town to buy some jeans. Okay, love, see you later. Oh, Aiden? Cathy's meeting Donna in the Salad Bowl. Can you tell her not to forget about the vegetables? That's grand. I've put some milk in the fridge. Good lad. Good on you. - See you later. - See you later. Oh, Mummy, what size am I? Now, check the label. Don't be getting the wrong ones. And, Aiden, try them on. Any word from John, hey? No, haven't heard from him. Aye, we should call round now. That's what I was planning to. Sure, he was steaming last night, so he was. Jesus. He was falling all over the place. It was well funny. Doing the Pogo. Can you believe that? It's no wonder he was kicked out. He's been barred from there before, hasn't he? He'll not get back in there in a hurry. Okay, okay. Children. Stay together in your groups, all right? Oran, James, Sean, go together. Look after Fernando. Okay, keep together. Car's in place. Keep up, everyone. Come on. Hello, Ulster Television newsroom. Bomb, courthouse. Omagh, main street. Can you speak more slowly? Which main street? Courthouse. Omagh, main street. Explosion in 30 minutes. Do you have a code word? Martha Pope. Malta? Martha. M-A-R-T-H-A P-O-P-E. IRA. Oglaigh na hEireann. We don't have a Main Street. Presumably they mean High Street, but that's down from the courthouse, not up. Is she sure she took down the warning right? He said Omagh Main Street. Yes, absolutely. I don't know what's wrong with it. The brake pads maybe? Yeah, could be one of the pins. In your dreams, hey. What exactly are you saying? Danielle O'Connor? Out of your league. Yeah, right. Put it here. How long is this gonna be? Don't know, ma'am. We've just had the call. But I have to get a school uniform today. I'd try it another day if I was you. No, you can't get through. Thank you. Just move on. Thanks. Sorry. There's a bomb warning. Go up the hill? There's a bomb warning up at the courthouse, but you can still shop on Market Street. I'm just stopping the cars from going up here. Ladies and gentlemen, please, there's an evacuation here. The warning said 200 yards up from the courthouse. If it says up from the courthouse, why are you sending us down? We're clearing up from the courthouse, as well. Just not prepared to take any risks. Clear everybody down to the bottom of Market Street. Anyone up at the top of the hill, make sure that they're led down to the bottom of the street. That's down to the bottom of the street. Gentlemen? Thank you very much. Bottom of the hill there, please. Thank you. And you, sir, madam. Thank you very much. Everyone move down to the bottom of the hill. Sorry, lads, you can't go up there. We just want to pop around the corner. No, we need to clear you down to the bottom of the hill. There's a security alert at the courthouse, so we need to get you to the bottom of Market Street. Cathy's in the Salad Bowl. I'm supposed to tell her to get stuff for Mummy. We'll head that way now. I'm back! You can stop that, Mummy. I'll make some tea. Did you see Aiden? He was looking for you. No, I must've missed him. Could've lifted me home. Can I just ask you to move down to the bottom of the street? Gentlemen, this way. Thank you. Bottom of the street here. Thank you. This is gonna keep us back now. We should be all right, like. Keep moving there. Walking to the bottom of the hill. I'd buy you a cup of tea, anyway. You can get it around downtown? No need for alarm, sir. Thank you very much. She's looking for you. This is really exciting. - We have time for a sticky bun. - And a cup of coffee. Okay. Thanks. Ice cream? For God's sake, someone get an ambulance! Come on, girls. Help! Be careful. Keep plenty of pressure on it. She won't get up! We need an ambulance! Could someone call an ambulance? Alan? Alan Radford? Mena! Get me out of this place! Ease him out. Can someone help me take this child? Yes, you are bleeding, but please stop moving. Please! Somebody! Please help us! Will somebody please help us? Daddy! Daddy, there's been a bomb in town. I came straight over. Dad, Cathy was down there. Christ. Patsy? Patsy! Patsy? Have you seen Cathy? It's not me. It's Aiden. - He's not back yet. - He hasn't rung. People are injured. He'll be helping. But he would've phoned us by now. Look, I'll go and find him. I'll go with you, Daddy. You stay with your mum. Stay with your mummy. - Michael! - No, Mum, it's all right. No, Mummy. It'll be grand. Mummy, honestly. Come on, let's go inside. Come on, come on. Go back up the street. That's it. Thank you. Come on, get yourselves sorted out. We're blocking off George Street. Move it! Come on! Excuse me. Can I go in there? No, I'm sorry, sir. But my son. We're evacuating the area, sir. I know, but Aiden will be helping with the rescue. Sir, it's only official personnel allowed in. Aye, but he would be official if he was helping. I have to find him. You need to get to a hospital. He might be helping there. Hospital? All right, some pumps there as a precaution down your right-hand side. Please help! Please help! Go on, go through. Aiden? Aiden? Have you seen my son anywhere? Aiden? Aiden Gallagher? - Aiden Gallagher? - Will somebody help me? Please make way now. Coming through now. Doctor, excuse me. Clear. - Nurse, nurse. - I can't. I can't. Cardiac output is down. Nurse. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sweetheart, we're gonna put this dressing on you, okay? Esther Gibson? Esther Gibson? Coming through. I can't find my daughters, Jolene and Nicky Marlow. One was in a checked shirt. She's crashing. Lorraine Wilson. She was 15. I'll stay here then. Sorry, doctor? Sorry. I'm looking for my son, Aiden Gallagher. Aiden Gallagher. Where would he be? We don't know all the names yet. I'll get back to you. Yeah, she's 36 years of age. She was working in a shop. Geraldine Breslin. She said her name was Maguire. Maguire. Johnson, that's what it was. It's Johnson. Excuse me, excuse me. Mike! Mike? Your mummy and daddy, are they here, son? I don't know. Has somebody told them, son? Don't know. Don't worry. I'll phone them, okay? Mike? Mike? Have you seen Aiden? Yeah. Where? He was standing beside me. You mean he was standing beside you when the bomb went off? Is that what you mean? Yeah. And now? Where is he now? Is he still in town? That's all I know. Okay, son, look, I'll phone your mummy and daddy. You need to stay awake, son. You need to stay awake for them. That's it. That's it. Nurse, will you please look after this boy? No, he's awake. He's in ward number 2, third floor. No, I'm looking for him now. He must be helping. Following what the police said were two deliberately misleading warnings about the location of the device... Patsy? Is he there? - Haven't you seen? - No. Oh, my God! Dozens of women and children were among the injured. People have been killed. Patsy, there are hundreds of people alive. I've seen them myself. I've seen people helping. No! He would've phoned us by now! I don't know where he is, but I'll go and find him. Daddy, they're telling people not to go to the hospitals. Go to the leisure center. That's where they're telling us to go. Cathy, don't let your mummy watch the TV. But we need to know. Don't let your mummy watch the TV! Sharon. Mum, what's wrong? It's okay, Darra. Come on. What's wrong with Mum? Sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sean McLaughlin. He's 12 years old. I'm looking for my son. I'm looking for Alan Radford. This is the work of dissident Republicans opposed to the Peace Process, Continuity IRA or Real IRA. I'm looking for my daughter, Lorraine Wilson. I want to see my wife. Where is she? Excuse me, I want to see my wife! Spanish children. But how many are you missing? Five. We have lost five. I am their teacher. Come with me over here. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Just, could... Can somebody... Could you help me, please? Nurse, can you help me? I'm looking for my son, Aiden Gallagher. He's not on the County or the Belfast list. Where is she? Not in Derry. But that's 30 miles away. Are you sure he's not there? No. Nothing as yet, Mr. Gallagher. - What do I do? - You'll just have to wait. - Can I help you? - I'm looking for Oran Doherty. Thanks. Jolene Marlow, is she on the list? His name's James Barker. He was on a school trip. Michael? Father. Mike? Stanley. This is Michael Gallagher. He's an old neighbor of mine. This is the Rev. Myers. Hello, Michael. We were neighbors up in Summerhill Park. This is Fr. Mullan. Stanley McCombe. Haven't seen you in ages. Seven years, isn't it? I can't believe that it's... Is Anne with you? She went to work this morning in the shop. I haven't seen her. So they told me to wait here. What about yourself? Well, I was working with Aiden on a car this morning, and then he went into town to get some jeans. Oh, Michael. They're saying it's the Real IRA. I thought this was all supposed to be over now. Yeah. Is there anything I can get you, Michael? No, thanks, Father. I just need to be on me own for a wee minute. See you later, Stanley. We'd ask all the families who still have relatives missing to please be patient. We will bring you further news as soon as we have it. Stanley? Mr. Gallagher? Yes. Please come through. Mr. Michael Gallagher. Mr. Gallagher, come in. Please sit down. I'm sure you know that there have been fatalities today. I know this is very painful for you. But what we need, Mr. Gallagher, is for you to tell us of any identifying features of your son. Aiden. Yes. No. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. Sweetheart. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Thanks, Father. Thank you, Father. They're beautiful flowers, aren't they? I've never seen this many flowers. - He was such a lovely... - Thanks, sweetheart. Has anybody seen Patsy? Ann, have you seen Patsy anywhere? - I think she's in the kitchen. - Is she? - She went upstairs. - And the girls? I think they were here a minute ago. I saw Cathy. Aye, Sharon was here. She can't have gone far. Wee Darra's over there. There's a fella on the phone asking for photographs of Aiden. I can't deal with that. Tell them to call back later. - Is it a journalist? - Aye. Michael, there's someone here who wants to speak to you. Tell them I'll be there in a minute, okay? I just want to find Patsy. Excuse me, can I get by there, please? Patsy? Sharon? And Aunt Rita's gonna come. Mummy? I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Is there anything I can do to help? Ann, thanks very much. Just leave us alone for a few minutes. God bless you. Keep in touch. See you soon. So, you're all right? Yeah. We'll see you tomorrow. Okay. See you, Darra. Do you want to take some food with you? No, Mummy, we have plenty. I'm going with her, Daddy. Help with Darra. - Will you be all right? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Yeah, we'll be fine. See you, Mummy. Okay. See you, Darra. Mum. Okay. What are you gonna do about college? It's not starting for a few weeks yet. You don't have to make up your mind yet, do you? Well, I'll see how I go. You'll be all right? Yeah, we'll be fine. We'll all be fine. Look after yourselves, okay? Bye. Safe driving, now. Are you sure you'll be all right? Yes. Safe home. Come on, Darra. Patsy, leave that, darling. I'm just gonna tidy away a few things. No, I'll do that. You go on upstairs to bed. I'll be up in 5 minutes, okay? - Go on ahead. - Okay. ...to continue with the Peace Process. tonight, some still critically injured. So far, the tragedy has claimed 31 lives, including those of 2 children. The group responsible for the Omagh bombing, the Real IRA, declared a permanent cease-fire at 2:00 A.M. this morning following pressure from the Provisional IRA and the Irish and British governments. Tony Blair said that this didn't alter his determination to catch the bombers. For our part, we have agreed that the two governments will work together and will do everything that is possible within their power to hunt down those that have been responsible for this outrage. Police today have... Hello? Is that Michael Gallagher? Yes. What about this football match? Football match? Alex Ferguson, Roy Keane coming to play a benefit match in Omagh. Surely, you knew about that. No, I haven't heard. Do you know if there's been any charges yet? Have the police told you anything about what they're doing? No, they haven't. Who is this, by the way? Laurence Rush. Laurence Rush? His wife owned the Gift Shop. My wife, Libbi, owned the Gift Shop before they blew her up. Yes, I knew Libbi. The point is, Michael, where's our voice in all this? I don't know. I've called a meeting for all the families. The Royal Arms, Tuesday night. He's organized a meeting, he says. Maybe we should go, Michael, just to know what's going on. What I find disgusting and downright insulting is the fact that they've reopened the street so shortly after the event. I was at the memorial for my daughter. And there was barely room for my family. Politicians everywhere. Trimble, Hume, McGuiness for God's sake! I never invited any of them. And now they're saying we're not entitled to compensation. It's not about the money. It's what they're saying. They're saying that he wasn't worth anything. My daughter has to strip to show her injuries for the compensation board, to show what they did to her. I can't believe people would make a young girl do that. This Omagh fund, they seem to be saying that it's almost like a Victorian means test. But what I want to know is what the RUC are doing. Can anyone tell me that? What has this got to do with the RUC? I'll tell you what it's got to do with the RUC. and 38 people have been released. That's what it's got to do with the RUC. Yes, but most of those are south of the border. That is the Garda. That is not the RUC. Nobody's telling us anything. Nobody's telling us a thing. I've written to Tony Blair. It's not worth the paper it's written on. Well, he is the prime minister for God's sake. It's the same old story. As long as the bombs stay out of London, they don't give a damn. It's always been that way, and it always will be. No, sorry, Laurence. I'm sorry. Please don't sit there and try and tell me that this is all somehow the fault of the British. When are the Irish gonna start taking responsibility for what happens in Ireland? Money for bombs, still going on. What's being done about that? Nothing! This is never gonna work. Michael, you've got to say something. The Nationalist community? What about the Unionist community? If we want peace, we've got to find a peace that works. Has Paisley ever put a bomb under a car? He doesn't have to. Every time he opens his mouth he condemns the Peace Process. No. Excuse me. What gives you the right to talk to people like this? Can I just say something? Please, can we all stop shouting at each other? Laurence, can I say something? Laurence, can I say something? Laurence, we're not gonna get anywhere if all we do is shout at each other. We're not gonna get anywhere. Go on, Michael. Go on. I'm not very good at public speaking. You can do it. Look, I haven't put on the TV since the day we buried our Aiden. So I don't know what's happening. But I do know there's Catholics in this room and Protestants. And Presbyterians. And Mormons. Marion's here. And... And... some of us believe in God. And now maybe some of us have no God. But I can tell you this. We're not gonna get anywhere unless we do it together. That's the truth of the matter. Hear, hear! You're so right. - Daddy? - What? Do you actually know what a chairman does? Haven't a clue, have you, Michael? Well, you just tell people when they can talk and when they can't talk. And maybe make a few phone calls every now and then. You can't manage to open your mouth at home. How are you gonna cope with that lot? Come on, it's okay for us to laugh. Well, I just think that it'll be good for us to be involved maybe, you know. Will we get something to eat? - Yeah. Where'll we go? - Chips. Oh, no, not chips again. Hello? Hello? I wonder, would it be possible to be put through to the person in charge of the inquiry? Yes, my name is Michael Gallagher. Is there anybody else in the office that I could speak to? I'm Michael Gallagher. My name is Michael Gallagher. I'm ringing on behalf of the Omagh Self-Help and Support Group. We're the families of the victims of the bomb. Hello. We're the Omagh Support Group. We've a meeting with Chief Superintendent Anderson. If you just go through that way there, please, sir. Chief Superintendent Eric Anderson. - It's Mister... - Gallagher. Michael Gallagher. Mr. Gallagher, please do come in. How are you doing? Stanley McCombe. Victor Barker. Alan Skelton. Elizabeth Gibson. Obviously, I'd like to extend my deepest sympathies to you all at this time. Now, please, if there's anything you need, anything at all. I presume you all have your own liaison officers by now. Yes. Now, we're still at the very early stages of a painstaking investigation. As you can imagine, we're facing an enormous task. But my officers are working night and day. You can be assured of that. Now... Excuse me. Would it be possible for me to ask a question? Yes, certainly, Mr. Gallagher. I think what we all want to know here is when will you be pressing charges against the men who did this? As I say, we're still at the very early stages of a very difficult inquiry. What I can say is we're making good progress. We're doing everything we can. We're trying to do our best. Do you know who did it? Obviously, we're all aware the Real IRA has claimed responsibility. I mean the actual people. I know the organization. We're asking if you know their names. We have an idea of some of them. We're getting into a sensitive area here. Look, I want prosecutions as much as you do. But the problem is evidence. Hard information. Okay. "We received your letter, but to be honest, sympathy is not enough." That's a great start. Whilst we understand the sensitive nature of the inquiry... Certain things may be censored. Yes, but we need to know why there haven't been any charges. Yes, I have it here. But they can't have arrested them for no reason, can they? What about the police? Oh, well, they acknowledged that "an explosion did occur and is the subject of an investigation." We've asked for a full briefing, but so far, we're not getting very far. On the arrests, we already know that they've all been released. For Jesus' sake! The churches have been very good and the local community groups. But it's not great. Very observant of you, Michael. Okay, look. We could sue them ourselves. The Real IRA, the 32 Counties Sovereignty Committee, all of them. They exist, don't they? They have assets. Money coming in from America. But we need evidence. We'll get evidence. They did it with O.J. Simpson, okay? Once he was acquitted, her family sued for damages. And they got a verdict. That's the point. Christ, if every victim of the Troubles started suing a paramilitary group, where would it end? Omagh Support Group. Even if they prosecuted one of them, it would be a start. Look, if we did this, there's a chance we could put them out of business for good. He's got a point. How much would it cost us? A million, million and a half. Where are we gonna find that kind of money? We raise it, Stanley. We open a fund, start an appeal. That'll take years. Years to even make a start. Somebody called. Says he knows who they are. - What? - What do you mean? Michael, what do you mean? We've got the names. Who was that? Didn't say who he was. - Jesus. - God. Who'd have thought it, huh? Okay, everybody, we'll be there in about 5 minutes. So we'll go to the front entrance. Let's be sure and keep together and retain our dignity, okay? It'll be okay. Stay together. Stay together. Come on, now, baby. Let's go. Are you in the Real IRA? What do you know about the Omagh bombing? - Murderers! - Colm Murphy. This is my son. He was murdered by the Real IRA. Excuse me? Excuse me. - Can you explain? - Seamus Daly. Or Colm Murphy, are these people here tonight? Organizers of the Omagh bomb. Murderers. How long are you going to protect them? You killed our sister. Philomena Skelton, murdered by the Real IRA! Why did my wife have to die? My daughter Lorraine was 15 years old. Geraldine Breslin, murdered by the Real IRA. Please don't support these people. Please. They killed my son. Everybody wants us to walk away, go quietly. So that they can get on with their Peace Process. My sister, Esther Gibson. Oran Doherty, murdered. What do you know? Don't give your money to these people. Please don't give your money to these people. They killed my son! Please. I must look after my wife there. Mr. Gallagher, what are you hoping to achieve here tonight? Please don't give your money to these people. I'm sorry. I have to go look after my wife. I'm all right. Come on, let's get off the road. I'm all right. Come on, sweetheart. Oh, Laurence. Where's the rest of them? Stanley wouldn't come on principle. Godfrey and Ann Wilson. We should have spoken to the others at the very least. We didn't handle this right. We're gonna upset the whole group. Are you coming or not? This way, gentlemen, please. He's in a room there, and he's gonna face me. If you'll just wait here a moment. They're here. Ready for you now. Mr. Rush? That's me. Gerry Adams. Michael Gallagher. Thanks for coming. Shall we sit down? I want to make it clear at the outset that I'm not talking to you as a politician when I tell you that this bombing was a dreadful and appalling atrocity. And my heart goes out to you all for the terrible loss that you're suffering. Obviously, we in Sinn Fein and the Republican community would like to do everything we possibly can to assist you. Mr. Adams, what we want to know is who is responsible. I don't know. I don't know who's responsible any more than you. What about the Real IRA? Or the 32 Counties Sovereignty Movement? You must know them. Somebody in Sinn Fein must know something. Look, it's no consolation to you. - What we have to do now... - Mr. Adams. Do you know any of these names? There's 18 men walking free. Liam Campbell. Seamus Daly. Murphy? I don't know them. Would you tell us if you did? Look, I'm here to help, if it's possible. These people are as much our enemies as they are yours. But you can ask your people to help the police. Rank-and-file Republicans are very wary about any cooperation with the RUC. Well, then, ask them to talk to the Garda. Get the information privately. Give it to me. I'll pass it on. That would still involve the RUC at prosecution. They'll not accept it. Look, what we have got to do now is make sure that the Peace Process keeps moving forward. Put the past behind us. That's the only way we're gonna deal with this. Mr. Adams. My brother was murdered by an IRA gunman in 1984. No witnesses came forward for that either, so they got away. So I agree with you. Let's put the past behind us. That was my brother then. But this is my son now. The war is supposed to be over. You say you want to build a new Northern Ireland, a peaceful Northern Ireland. But how can we build a peaceful Northern Ireland unless you help us to bring his killers to justice? I understand what you're saying, Mr. Gallagher, and my sympathies are with you. But assisting the RUC is only going to alienate hard-liners in our community. The very people we have got to keep on board if we're to keep this thing moving forward. This is the reality we face. We cannot jeopardize the Peace Process. They were pleased enough to be photographed at the funerals, but what are they actually doing now? He's busy at the moment. Can I get him to call you back? No, look, the question to ask the British and Irish governments are these. How many officers have been assigned to the inquiry? Has a witness-protection plan been offered to the general public? Hello, Father, how are you doing? Ah, no, this is very important, now. The Garda haven't even appealed for witnesses on their website. I'm sorry? Yeah, but the one thing that we're not getting here is the one thing that we all want. Those men answering to their crimes in a court of law. That's right. Yeah, but they're just not responding. And you know Victor Barker? He's English. He lost his son. Do you know what he does? He sends letters to the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. And then he gets these personal replies saying, "Dear Victor, best regards to the family. Yours ever, Tony." That's great, isn't it? It's lovely. Then he starts to ask questions, and he wants meetings. Then he gets a reply from his secretary, and then he gets a reply from an assistant to the secretary. It's ridiculous. Hello? No, I'm sorry. Can I take a message? He finally gets so angry, he sends a photo of his son over to Tony Blair, blown up. It's a terrible picture. Absolutely. And do you know what they did? They lost it. I swear to God, they lost it. Is it any wonder the families are so angry? Is it any wonder? All we're asking for here is that the governments pay attention to the promises they make. Look, John, just hang on a second. I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye. That was someone from the BBC. I know this is difficult. They're doing a "Panorama" program, and they want to talk to you about it. I know it's difficult with the phones going nonstop. The "Belfast Telegraph" rang, and that interview's at 4:00. Don't. Hello? Stanley, I'm in the middle of something now. I'll give you a call in 5 minutes, okay? Bye. I can't do this anymore. But we have to know what happened. I know what happened. I know what happened. Someone killed Aiden. That's what happened. And I don't care about why. Or what or how. Any of it. All I want to know is that he's at peace. And that's it. That's all. We can't stop now. We've only just started. Hello? Their legacy is carnage. Carnage that was indiscriminate in every way. and babies were killed. The bombers were former members of the Provisional IRA who opposed their cease-fire. Liam Campbell lives in a comfortable house just a few yards inside the Irish Republic. According to intelligence sources, he's the so-called officer commanding the Real IRA. There are two mobile phones whose records on the day of the bombing are of special interest. One of these two phones belonged to this man, Colm Murphy. He said he handed over both his mobile and his foreman's mobile to another builder. That builder was Seamus Daly. We spotted Colm Murphy arriving at this building in Dundalk, which is where we caught up with him. I wonder if you could explain to me why it is that you gave your mobile telephone and the mobile telephone of your foreman to Seamus Daly on the eve of the Omagh bombing. I didn't give my phone to anybody. Despite the fact that the police on both sides of the Irish border know the identities of those they believe to have been the bombers, there is no immediate prospect of charges. The absence of prosecutions is an increasing burden for the families of the Omagh bombing. Hello? Smoke? No, I don't. Could you tell me who you are? As far as you're concerned, my name's Kevin Fulton. You said you were in the IRA? So, do you know any of these names? You're missing McKevitt. Micky McKevitt. He's the one who organized it. He was the quartermaster. He looked after the weapons and all the explosives. He walked out on the IRA after Adams and McGuiness signed the Good Friday Agreement. He took Campbell and the others with him and set up the Real IRA. They're not the 'Ra. They hate the IRA. For selling out, for Good Friday, for giving up the arms struggle. So, why did you ring me? To tell you you're not asking the right question. But what is the right question? You don't get it, do you? They knew. They knew about the bomb. How? How did they know? 'Cause I was working for them all along. The Army, MI5, RUC. Told them myself. I was a mole. I don't understand. I had a contact in the Real IRA. He told me there was something big on. Something spectacular. So I met my RUC handler, and I told him. Two days later, Omagh. But surely, they would've done something. Why did they not try to stop it? Did you see any Army checkpoints in Omagh that day? Were there any soldiers on the street? No, please, please. Look, we need help. It's very confusing, all this. Be careful with that list. Accusations by former British spy Kevin Fulton that the intelligence community knew in advance about the Omagh bombing have embarrassed the security services and raised questions about the failure to bring prosecutions. There have been calls for the allegations to be investigated by the Police Ombudsman. Stanley? It's me. It's all over the papers, Michael. If this is true... They're gonna have to answer some questions now. They can't ignore this. We should call a meeting. I'm still away in the South. I've a wee bit more to do. - Take care, Michael. - I will. Come on in. Pleased to meet you. My name is John White. Mr. White. Well, I'll leave you to talk for a while. Okay. Thanks, Father. Come through. Have you heard of the Garda's National Surveillance Unit? No, I haven't. Well, we're a secret department. We were keeping tabs on the Real IRA for the Irish government. I was working there when the bomb went off. I had a source in the Real IRA and a good one. He got them their cars. Stole them, you know. Anyway, we knew that a car with a bomb was going to be driven to the border. So what happened? I was told they were gonna let it go. What, deliberately? They said they were gonna let it go. Why? Why would they do that? Oh, protecting the informants. Maybe they thought a big bomb would discredit the Real IRA, get them out of the picture. Maybe they just didn't think it through. No one would get killed. Maybe they just fucked up. the machine gets lazy, you know? Look, Michael, I'm not saying lots of honest people, police, didn't try their best. They did. But there won't be any prosecutions. Not for Omagh. Ah, no. There have to be. We have to keep the pressure on. Listen. If you ask me... they made a deal. Put the guns down, declare a cease-fire, and we won't prosecute. You're in the way of the Peace Process, Michael. And nothing... Nothing is gonna be allowed to do that. My God. My God. Cathy, what are you doing home? It's the end of term. Oh, yeah, right. You knew I was coming home. I phoned you. Oh, yes, I did. Sorry. Where's Mummy? She's upstairs. Ah, well, she's better off sleeping. She won't get out of bed. She never goes out. She has these days, you know. Who looks after her? - Sharon. - Sharon? Yeah. Sharon comes over. Look, we're doing okay. Your mummy likes to be on her own, doesn't she? - It's true. - It's not true! She's too sad to get up. And you're just as bad. Who's looking after you? I'm all right. - You look terrible. - Really, I'm fine. You both look terrible. - I've been to a meeting. - You're always at a meeting. Every time I've rung, you're at a meeting. Or on TV. Please, stop arguing. What's the use of all this running around? Do you really think they care what you're doing? Do you think they're gonna stop the shooting and the bombing just because you gave an interview to the "Belfast Telegraph" or the BBC? Who are you doing it for? I'm doing it for Aiden. Aiden's dead! He's dead. You should be here, Daddy. Looking after us. White said they were trying to protect an informer. What about protecting our families? Flanagan better have some answers. We'll get some answers, hopefully. The Chief Constable will see you now. Morning. Laurence Rush. Elizabeth Gibson. Kevin Skelton. I'm very grateful to have this opportunity to talk to you all today, personally, and to try to reassure you after some of the things that have been said. I know you'll be concerned about the Fulton case, and so I wanted to brief you myself. Look... it's very difficult. The world of intelligence is murky, and trying to anticipate the intentions of a terrorist organization like the Real IRA is difficult. We need good, reliable information. A good informer is worth his weight in gold. But a bad one is a disaster. And Kevin Fulton was a bad one. He made things up. For money. Trying to tell us what he thought we wanted to hear. So we cut him off. There was nothing else to do. But he said he knew. He warned you. He knew there was something big on. Well, I'm sorry, obviously, that he's been given the prominence in the media that he has, but I can assure you that there's nothing in this. Nothing. I've looked into it myself. Shouldn't there be an independent opinion on this? The Police Ombudsman, aren't they looking into it? The Ombudsman is there to deal with routine complaints, to give the communities a stake in policing after Good Friday. Yeah, but what is the point of the Ombudsman if it isn't looking into the things that we want investigated? What we're talking about is intelligence. MI5, Special Branch. It's not the proper area for the Ombudsman. It's far too sensitive. Surely, you understand that. Well, what about the Garda's surveillance man in Dublin? He's telling the same stories. Well, obviously, I can't speak for the Garda, and Detective Sergeant White is not one of my officers. I think he was suspended. Wasn't he, George? Michael. Can I call you Michael? I understand the frustration that you all feel, that we all feel, when something like this comes up. I just wish that you had come to me earlier with your concerns. I could've saved you the trouble. Michael, I know you want progress. So do I. We all do. But you're scaling down the investigation. Manpower adjustments are always reviewed as any investigation progresses. There's nothing abnormal in that. Do you seriously think that I would do anything to jeopardize the inquiry? You have to trust us. Otherwise, what else is there? Did White not tell you he was in trouble? We need to be more careful about who we trust. Who's to say Flanagan's telling us the whole story about Fulton? Now the Chief Constable's lying, is he? We set up this organization to help the police, not put them in the dock. You tell me what he's done! If it's not true, then where's his answers? What are you saying? He's not doing his best? No! No, I don't think he is doing his best! He's trying to catch the men who killed our daughter. He's all we've got. This whole thing stinks. If you think that we're being told the whole truth, you're more stupid and naive than I thought. I won't be a part of this anymore. We come here to support each other, not listen to this. Och, Hugh, wait. I'm sorry, Michael. - Laurence... - Don't! Don't you start. I'll not stand by and let them get away with it. And if I have to sue the RUC and the British government, I'll do it on my own. It's not working, is it? None of it. It's been a difficult day. No. I mean the whole campaign. What have we achieved? Michael, we have achieved... No, I mean, Stanley, what have we actually achieved? We've started the civil action. We've started nothing. We just talked about starting it, that's all. That's not true. I'm gonna set up meetings in London next month. We need a million pounds. That's what we need. They're closing down the investigation. They're never gonna catch them. Never. They're still shooting and bombing. They're still walking around the place, drinking in bars, having a good life, laughing at us. I mean, there's been over 2,000 unsolved murders since the beginning of the Troubles. Why should we be any different? I mean, maybe they're right. Maybe us pursuing our campaign is destroying the Peace Process. Michael, you can't start thinking like... Och, face it, Stanley, we're getting nowhere. We have supported each other. We've kept each other going. Is that not enough to be going on with? Not anymore, Stanley. I'm staying home now. Just thought I'd come back, try and work again, you know? We planned it all together, you know? he said. When I got too old to get out of a chair. No, it's okay, it's okay. He wasn't just my son, you know. He was my workmate. Everything. He was everything to me. And... when I'm in the house... and the three of you are talking together... still doing all the things you've always done... And I tell myself it's not fair. I tell myself it's not true. Inside, I feel he meant more to me. And I know that's awful... to feel like that. Because I know how much you loved him. But... I can't feel the way you feel. Only the way I feel. Patsy, I think I'll just go down to the Birches and see what's going on. The Ombudsman's giving a report today. Yes, I know. I saw it in the paper. Well, I won't be long. Just think I should show some solidarity, you know? All right. See you later. Aye. See you later. Okay. - How are you? - Not too bad. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming here this morning. Michael, welcome back. I just dropped in, that's all. How's Patsy? Much better than before, thanks. I think you all know about the "Sunday People" article in which a man calling himself Kevin Fulton claimed that he had told the police about Omagh. We felt it essential to investigate these allegations not least to show the people in Northern Ireland that we are serious about a new era in policing. I want to introduce you now to the Police Ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, who will take you further into the presentation. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. The Omagh bomb was the most grave and exceptional crime in the history of Northern Ireland, and the failure to bring prosecutions shames us all. I want to start by saying that the people responsible for the Omagh bombing are the terrorists who planned and executed the atrocity. Nothing should ever detract from that unequivocal fact. We have established Kevin Fulton did pass on information relating to the alleged dissident terrorist activity to his Special Branch handlers. The Chief Constable has said that Kevin Fulton's evidence was disregarded because it was unreliable. But I have to tell you that when we examined Special Branch records, we found no formal written record of Kevin Fulton being unreliable in the period up to August 1998. He is graded as a reliable source. I am satisfied that further action should have been taken on that information. It is clear that Special Branch did not pass it on to the Omagh bomb investigation team. A large crowd has gathered at the Silverbirch Hotel in Omagh. The Police Ombudsman is meeting the Omagh families to discuss her long-awaited report. We'll bring you more news as soon as we have it. More worryingly, in the course of our review, it became clear to us that Special Branch were also in receipt of other information which indicated that an attack on Omagh was imminent. Not least, an anonymous call on the 4th of August warned that an attack would be made on police in Omagh on the 15th of August 1998. I have to tell you that these warnings were not followed up prior to the bombing. Now, significant evidential opportunities were most certainly lost when Special Branch did not share the intelligence with the senior investigator. - Are youse in, girls? - Aye, Mummy. Now, this is only one of a number of concerns we have about the conduct of the inquiry. We found which we say could have relevance to the Omagh bombing. Of these documents, only 22% have been made available to the investigation team. The book logging all terrorist warnings at Omagh disappeared without explanation. Whose fault was that? We don't have any satisfactory answer to that question. Two months into the investigation, the investigation team was reduced by 42%. Shame! Shame! It's all full up. It's not possible to say what impact action taken as a result might have had or whether this action would have prevented the Omagh bomb, but it is little wonder that out of this uncertainty that doubt and mistrust and conspiracy arise. I have concluded with great sadness that the judgment and leadership of the Chief Constable has been seriously flawed. The victims, you, the families, the people of Omagh, as well as the officers of the RUC have been let down by defective leadership, poor judgment, and a lack of urgency. And as a result, the chances of detaining and convicting the Omagh bombers has been significantly reduced. The man's a disgrace! He should resign! - Yes, he should resign! - He should resign! Have we not suffered enough? This has gone far enough! It's a disgrace. We won't get any justice, not in this country. Justice. Justice! Mr. Gallagher. We need to speak out. How do the families feel, Mr. Gallagher? Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson. Do you have anything to say to the Chief Constable? Mr. Wilson. I'm sorry. I have to get through to my wife. Five minutes. Michael, please. Can I get through there, please? You came. The girls said I had to. I wanted to. We lost our sister, Esther Gibson. We have fought this far... Thank you. You have to say something. Please. They're waiting for you. Okay. Come on. Mr. Wilson. Mr. Gallagher. Mr. Gallagher, please. Mr. Gallagher. Mrs. O'Loan is the first person to tell us the full story of the Omagh investigation and why there have been no prosecutions, and we'd like to thank her for that. The day our loved ones lost their lives and our families were torn apart, we were told that everything would be done to bring their killers to justice. To learn today that they have failed us before the bomb, after the bomb, and are still failing us now, to have that knowledge, however distressing, however shocking, means that we can at last move forward. I would like to announce today that we will be pursuing our own legal action against the Real IRA, against those who support and fund it, and those who are responsible for this dreadful atrocity. But more than that, we would like to call into account the security forces and the police and the politicians in London, Belfast, and Dublin who have promised us so much but have, so far, singularly failed to deliver. We speak not just for ourselves. We speak for the victims of the Troubles of whatever tradition and all those victims of terror wherever it happens. We will not go away. We will not be quiet. We will not be forgotten. Come on, girls. We'll go round this way. I do not accept either the broad thrust or most of the detail of the Ombudsman's criticisms. And any impartial or objective assessment cannot fail to recognize the high quality of leadership that I have given to the Omagh investigation.
