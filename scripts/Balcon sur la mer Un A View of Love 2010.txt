I'm scared l'll forget our old place. Turn it up. You've seen the cornice is crumbling? I know. Onlythe left wing is 19th century. My brothers are keen to sell. I'm not sure. Not at all sure. Yes, so you said. They're penniless. They were in the army. I wish it was worth nothing, then they wouldn't bother me. Are you from Aix, Mr. Palestro? Not by birth. I moved here as a child. If I sold up, l'd feel l'm throwing it all away. Not the house, the past. As if none of it had ever existed. Why wait to sell up? You want it to collapse? I'll think it over. Again? They laugh at me in the office. You call, I come running. And still no contract. Morning! Morning, Marc. You saw the old lady again? Didn't she change her mind? She's talking to the competition. She's a smart cookie. Can you call Filippi? He's not happy. Filippi's a crook. He's a nice guy. A nice crook. Father-in-law. There you are. Take a look at that. They've agreed to the share transfer. What's the score? Next up Wilander? Or Noah. Foryour signature, Mr. Prat. Come with me later. I can't. l've got a lot on. We'll grab a bite at Le Gondolier. The buyer arrives at 3. Robert, really, I can't. I get dizzy on the freeway. Okay, but no cigars. Hopefully, I can sell this one fast. Catch you up. You're making all the sales. She's interested. This is her second visit. You've settled in at Pennafort? Is my daughter happy? Sure. lt's big. You'd better have more children. Or buy a pool table. You left stuff at Rue Vlane? Where the hell is the damn woman? Books and a few boxes l'll clear out. Photos. Here she comes. Run! Go get her, will you? I'm flagging a bit. What's she called? Mrs. Mandonato. Mrs. Mandonato. Do you need more time? No, l've seen everything. Does the property go beyond the path? Ask my father-in-law. He's overseeing the sale. Excuse me! I believe we're driving you back? I think so. Does the property go beyond the path? It's all part of the estate... From beyond those blue cypress trees level with the young vines there. The owner needs to sell fast. Lovely man, a bit bohemian. lt's an attractive property. Superb location, wonderfully situated. A buyer from the UK is keen to see it again. You're staying at Hotel... Hotel de l'Abbaye. And the company you mentioned is... A property management firm. -You represent them? -Yes. You supervise the renovation? For a house like that, yes. I'll need to see the surveyor's report. We have it for you at the office. - Already? - There was no traffic. Who'll make me a coffee? How's business in Nice? Dead. No buyers. I showed a Saudi round. He didn't open his wallet. So, how's my little Patricia? She looks ravishing. Last year's heartbreaks left you slimmer. You don't want to work for me? No, she doesn't. Hi, Sergio. That house in Fontvieille last year, how much was it? Do you remember? That's right. She's not haggling. lt's looking good. - How much did you say? - 800. It's almost all too easy. You took my advice for the adverts? - Too expensive. -You rogue! and nothing in Italy. Why bring me in as a partner? Poker tonight? No, we have plans. Family... Wise man... l'd have cleaned you out. You okay? Gave it my all at tennis. And elsewhere. Your friends from Perugia called. We gotta keep after them. Why didn't you call me in Nice? I tried. You'd left. - Can we drop you at your hotel? - No, l'll walk. Which way is it? Second right and it's on your right. Thanks. Pool aerobics? Manouche? I can't get it right. Not very sporty, are you? Don't go out of your depth, my love. What are you doing here? I met a client for coffee. And you? Working the hotels this early? See you. Is Mrs. Mandonato here, please? Yes. I believe she's coming down. Should I call her? I'll Wait. Marc, stay away from the windows. There was shooting outside last night. I was afraid l'd missed you. Recognize me? Yes. It didn't click right away. It is you? It's me. I was sure I knew you, but I couldn't place... Marc Palestro. Oran, Algeria. You recognized me. Yes. Why didn't you say? Yesterday, there were too many people. And you didn't seem as if... This is mad. Suddenly, last night, I... lt's her. You're going to buythe house? I think so. Lt's a fine property. You've worked there long? Yes. You were going to leave without... Without calling me? Your hair was longer then. Less... Cathy. Ma'am, anything from the minibar? No. I have to go. l'm late. You're taking a train? Yes. I'll drive you. - l'll get a cab. -I insist. When did you move back to France? '62? - What month? - June. Come on... Stop! We're not allowed. Come back. Nobody on the terrace! Get off there! You kids! Get back downstairs! When do you have to be home? I have the time. In my building, lots of people have left. Do you think we'll stay? Us? Of course. You're sure? Yes, l'm sure. -You have to pay inside. - Right. Li'S 200. Well? I missed it. Where are you going? There's only one train this afternoon. l'll manage. I have a meeting in Cassis. l'll drive you. - Cassis is along way. - No, it's not. What will I do during your meeting? It won't take long. Afterwards, l'll drive you to Marseille. I was in love with you. I never think about Algeria. I don't know why. At home, there was no nostalgia. Nobody mentioned it. My parents worked hard, turned the page. It catches up with you, see? You're doing well, big deals. I get by. Bythe way, there are no other offers. Don't be rushed into it. It's done. Who ran that candy store in your building? I don't remember. Cigarette. Mandonato. Your husband's name? I kept it. He died a few years back. A diving accident off Reunion Island. L'm sorry. We'd separated. You're married? Yes. With an 11-year-old girl. Check out the view... You'll see better from the sea. They're already building across the bay. And the water supply? There's a great little spring on the property. - lt's a tough sell. - Don't saythat! Planning permission was a real battle. Is this your lady? Like it? What do you think? Lt's beautiful. Let's go down. With those heels, you'll never make it. Give her a hand. I can stay here. Come on, don't leave me. Good idea, bringing yourwife. She's beautiful, fair... If we make a deal, l'll show you the truffles and the bantams. Look at this! Magnificent! It's sublime! There you see... The land starts at those pine trees, see? - Above the path. -Yes, I see. And stretches to the road, over the hill. Over the hill? You see? Shit, what's wrong now? - What? - lt's stalled. Do you mind moving forward, next to your... Nothing to worry about. No problem. Lsn't it beautiful? Just imagine a garden like that. It has everything. Trees, color... Fennel. Fennel in abundance. I can't live without fennel. I'll show you. If you buy, l'll show you everything. We'll get it started. It does this sometimes. lt's getting old. Your parents still alive? Myfather. I thought he'd stay on after independence. I'd never met people like you, who thought that way. I was always a bit afraid foryou. Evening, Marc. Evening, sir. You're dead! Who is this? You and your Arab friends! Leave Algeria alone, commie bastard? You're dead! Shit! In the doghouse? You're serving dinner? Of course. You wanted a shower? I went for a swim. It was chilly. You'll have to take a room. Fine. See if n"4's ready. Can I use the phone? On the bar. Dial direct. Follow me, ma'am. Hi, Manouche. Is Mommythere? No, don't bother her. L'm dining in Cassis with my client. He's a tough nut. Tell her not to wait up, l'll be late. Lots of love. You hurt yourself? Yes, at the beach. You always had that? Stay some more. The guy who ran the store... Fuentes. Yes... That was it, Ithink. Fuentes. Princess, my happiness depends on you Your father has chosen a groom... Iphigenia. Ac: 3, scene 4. There you'll claim my heart that brims with love My lord, the time has not yet come to go The Queen will grant that I dare ask For proof of your love that I must have Allow me to introduce a young princess Marie-Jeanne! Heaven with nobility her head has blessed Ladies and gentlemen! Evacuate the hall! The area's shut down! Get in! Quickly! We had no more classes. The army had requisitioned the schools. What else? Oh yes... We watched a film with Darry Cowl playing a delivery boy. We all lived on the same street. You were on the 2nd floor. I rememberyour mother. She was very pretty. She had a wool coat with a white collar. She got it out every Christmas. She complained there were no winters. One time, we went to the beach. There was this Arab guy where he wasn't supposed to be. Some guys went after him. I think he got Iynched. I can't have been there. Yes, you were. I don't remember. We all have different memories. We lost touch and now here we are. It's late. Can you drop me at Orgon? Why Orgon? Is it better foryou? I have people to see on the coast. For work? Yes. Partly. There are no signs. When your husband died, you'd been separated long? Awhile. When was it? Five years ago. L've moved. l'm between apartments. Is this the right road? Marc! My love... Fuck! Shit! Cathy? Here I am. Can you take us to Orgon? You're sure this is okay? Fine. You can go. Okay... See you the 23rd. Why the 23rd? You're signing the preliminary contract. Oh yeah... You have a number where I can call you? An address or... No. The 23rd. Alright, let's go, sir! We'll take that. We'll leave that. Take that. And that. Is this box going? Yes. Marc, what are you doing? Get dressed. We're going. Cathy! Stop that! Marie-Jeanne! I'll be back. Tell her! Tell her l'll be back! I can see ayacht. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be arriving in Malaga at 3 p.m. local time. Do you like my drawing? Yes! lt's amazing! Lsn't her head a bit big? Your mother seems fine. She's alert, she's all there. Today, she's fine. Yesterday wasn't so good. It's her bridge club. She never forgets that. We went to Madrid last month. She went round the Prado on her own, no problem. See you down there? Maybe. Am I wearing too much make-up? No. Somebody said I had too much make-up on. You Iookfine. Do you want a nap? Know who I heard about the other day? Cathy. Cathy Rivet. You remember her? Yes. The girl who lived opposite. You remember? Her father was a teacher. She's dead. The little girl's dead. I saw her. I promise you. Of course she isn't! When? She was killed in a bombing. When? Just after we left. Shortly afterwards. Who told you? We found out. It's not true. Ask Ghislaine. How would Ghislaine know? Why shouldn't I know? You were so fond of her. We didn't want to hurt you. Bullshit! Why wouldn't I have known? You were so sad about leaving. I was sad? You stopped talking. We were at a loss. Forget it, it won't change anything. I have to get ready. They're waiting for me at the club. You must be wrong. I met her. I saw her. Who? Don't take it like that. I think she is dead. Actually, l'm sure she is. Her parents were pro-independence. At the end, it was avv'ful. We'd just left. I remember her clearly. She lived across the street. A little blonde. You're both nuts. Manouche, we're going! Lt's foryou. The garage. He hung up. You get your car back today? Supposedly. What day is it again? The 23rd. The Marbella photos are great. I look strange. Your mom and sis are like a married couple. L've gotta go. - l'll drive you. We're ready. -I called a cab. Have you met my son-in-law? Mr. Arnoux's a lawyer. Mr. Vaskine and Mr. Alqui. - Passing by? - Yes. Have a coffee. - Going to see the Bruix place? - No. What time is it? -You're sure she's coming? - She'll be here. We're signing with Mrs. Mandonato. The preliminary contract on the Vintignires house. - She's hardly even late. - Traffic's bad into town. She's coming by cab? My partner's picking her up at the airport. A coffee, please. You've taken overfrom Mr. Bastistelli? I knew him well. A lovely man. He's retired, but he's not far. He moved to Salon de Provence. Salon? Right... Not late, am I? Lthinkwe're all here. We were taking a break. The office is right there. - Do you want a drink? - No, thanks. Take care of the check. I booked us into Bodin for lunch. Join us. - Found a spot? - In the parking lot. L'll walk with you to the office. You're staying over tonight? Yes, I want to take it easy. Do you know the woman? Who? Mandonato. Robert asked me to pick her up on the way from Marseille. What about her company? I put some feelers out. It sounds solid. You talked to her? Why? She didn't say much. She dozed in the car. Sign here. The guys who skedaddled in '81, started putting their money into wine. The local vineyards rocketed in price. It didn't last long. You never signed the book. I visited the Brignolles vineyard. Didn't some Swedes buy it? Yes, a Swedish tobacco firm. You should sign, too. You were tempted to branch out? I considered it. Lt's high-risk, very competitive. You need to know wine. More than anything else, wine is a passion. An obsession. You're left-handed? Yes. I read somewhere that left-handed women are more... More what? Intelligent. Or sexy... I don't remember. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Your car's ready. Do you want us to drive it over? If that's okay. No problem. Sorry, goodbye. That must be your first ever accident. Yes, you're right. The boy can do no wrong. He inspires trust. He has no flaws. He doesn't drink... A glass of wine now and then. Really, the perfect son-in-law. The Vacqueyras is excellent. The cellar's good here. Excuse me. I want to see you. Lt's tricky. Why? You're at the same hotel? Yes. I don't know... I heard... What did you hear? Nothing. Things... I didn't believe. Yes. In one hour. Yes. L'm here to see Mrs. Mandonato. Just a moment, please. Sir, the person isn't staying with us. Look under M for Mandonato. No, l'm sorry. We have nobody of that name. Thankyou. That's all? Lt's the offer to buy. There must be something else. It's all with the lawyer. Was there a problem this morning? Lt's just not professional not to keep an address. - lt's usual practice. - Usual practice! I'll look again. You need to call Ricord back. I said l'll call the asshole! If you say so. Look who's sitting in my chair. Make yourself at home. Suzanne, can you pour me a scotch? That's a deal well done. We just have to wait now. How did she pay? By check. from visit to pre-sale agreement. How about that? It all seems above board. She's a widow. You think she's staying over? No, l've no idea. You were there when we left the restaurant. She dashed straight off. Why? What's bothering you? -We tidied up inside. - Great, thanks. -We had no time to wash it. - That's okay. - Thanks. - Thankyou. Goodbye. What are you doing with that? It was in the car. He blurted it out after class. Just like that. I reminded him l'm a professor. He just kept on, said he wanted to tell me since Xmas. L'm frazzled. Go easy. Everything okay? They having fun? I owed them an invite. You owed them nothing. You'd come with me to Algeria? Algeria? You're thinking of going? I don't know. Maybe. Where? L've no idea. Not the tourist trail. Most likely, lwon't go. You never talk about it. I wasn't allowed to. It was forbidden. Like we had to feel guilty or something. You were all on the wrong side. But you were just a kid. We weren't kids. And we weren't adults. What's wrong? Why'd you turn the lights out? She came from Mycenae. Who was she? Iphigenia, the king's daughter. She wanted to conquer Troy... but the wind dropped and her ships were becalmed. I have a buyer for the St. Foirest woods. I forgot the hunters. Nearly got shot. You'll have the briefing in 10 minutes. Mr. Ricord, good morning. Good to talk to you at last. Yes, we need to meet. Tomorrow at 5 at the office? See you then. My pleasure. Bye. I found an address foryou. When the lady came through first time, she left that. We sent her a selection of properties. L'll be back. Where are you going? L'll Call. Mr. Snclauze has just arrived. Sergio? - Can you handle Cassis? - How come? -I have to go to Le Muy. - What the heck for? Look, I brought all the paperwork. My colleague won't be long. Do you know Mrs. Mandonato? Hello, l'm a real estate... Can 't hear you. - A real estate... - Can't hear a word. Come on up. The intercom doesn't work. Come in. L'll be right with you. Take a seat, please. I didn't hear what you do, but l'm not buying anything. L'm trying to contact Mrs. Mandonato. We're doing a property deal and I can't reach her by phone. - Does she live here? - No. But you see her? Not for a few days. But when I do, l'll tell her. Does she have another address or number? If she didn't give you it, l'd rather... -You have a card? - Yes. L'm not too early? The chef said it's very spicy. - lt's beef? - Yes. - Thanks. - A pleasure, Jo. If anybody had said one day l'd live off this stuff... They're good people. Can I get you adrink? No, thanks. Is that your card? L'll tell her. Has the restaurant been there long? It must be... ten years now. I rented it out to them. Before, I had the whole building. Tell me, what's she buying? A house. Expensive? Pretty. Beautiful, isn't she? She's my whole life. My pearl! Actually, we go back... along way. To when we were kids. Tell me, son, who are you? What's your name? Hello, sir. Can we have some candy? Not inside, please. Out you go. When he gets back, l'll look at him like this. He hasn 't noticed my eyes yet. He'll be dazzled. I'll tell him I have an endless gift for fantasy. He hasn't noticed the way I look at him but when he... Damn it! What's wrong, Marie-Jeanne? You had it. It was great. Keep going. I have to act natural, like a real ingnue. Sorry. Let's call it a daythere. See you Monday. Morna, my text. Marie-Jeanne! -You're going to Marie's birthday? -I don't know. See you! You're here? You're wet. L'm taking you to dinner. I can't, l'm busy. You called the agencythis morning? My poor plant. What did they say about me? Nothing. Lt's a done deal. A good one. Why? The lunch was a pain. Here... You picked up the mail? No, l'll go tomorrow morning. The young guy at the agency, who is he? Marc? He was there at lunch? Who is he? He's a guy who's very... You like him? What's he like? - Professionally? - Impeccable. A bit square, maybe. No, he's fine, quiet. He has ayoung family. And his father-in-law... Did you talk? We didn't get time. Racine? lphigenia. I just came across it. That's who you should play. What's her name, that other romantic heroine? There are several. The one who has her lover killed, the king... What about your play? We're only performing it twice. Or The Lady ofthe Camellias. The one who takes ages to die. Drink? This time, we have to sign the final contract. Why? The friends l'm working for have a tax auditor sniffing around. That wasn't the plan. When did they say? They mustn't appear anywhere. Who'll sign? Ltwon't befor long. L've never done that. Lt's only for three months. Then they'll buyyou out. What does it mean for us, financially? From one to five. Don't worry about it. Your name won't be there very long. What about the funds? How does it work? We pick up the money. There'll be a cashier's check. And some cash for us. You can say no. Me? Hi there. I got 7 in my test. - First and last. - Be right back. L'll be going. Did you ask for information on Mandonato? Yes. It arrived. Lt's bugging me. Her company's based in Nice. I meant to ask Sergio to drop by, take a look. I can go if you want. You've got the address? Sure, but Sergio... l'm at Cagnes tomorrow anyway. Dad, are you eating with us? Well... If I went back to myjob, what would you say? L'd understand that you want a normal life. Meaning? But you didn't enjoy being stuck back there, in your cubby-hole in the archives. I can't find my lighter. I hiked up there with my father. We picnicked on top. He was young then, plenty of stamina. He was so happythat day. He took off his widower armband. A guy came by. Ayoung man who knew you when you were little. His father was a wine merchant. Palestro. He came here? Yesterday. Do you remember him? He looked at your photo. Didn't you want to marry him when you were little? You gave him my address? He insisted, but no. What's Sergio Bartoli doing here? He's invited everyone to lunch. He went to the deli. He drove you here? It was on his way. When did you open your pension? '63, Iihink. I'll put '63. You don't work Wednesdays? In lieu oftime-off in July. -You still work at the law courts? -Yes. The fourth circuit? As ever. Did you receive notification of payment? If not, ask for it. We'll see. I don't go to the town hall anymore. Lt's ready downstairs, Dad. Sergio! Hello, Jo. You're head of the table. Paella? A little ros? Just a drop. Jo, this is Claude Fedida, who owned the kennels here. And Max, who owns the Manilla bar and works in St. Tropez. They're friends, passing through. Didn't you have the chicken farm on the Callas road? Lt's a garage now? There was an epidemic. The chicks started dying off. In three days, they were all gone. Ruined me. I don't like talking about it. Mr. Fuentes, we didn't keep you up last night with the wedding reception? No, it was fine. I listened to your music. To friendship between France and China! Okay, Dad? Shuck yourjacket. No, l'm fine. Our friend Chuang's a nice guy, but he called me about renovation work. Last year, we did the roof upstairs. I said, Okay, l'll pay. But I don't have time. I can't be here deciding what needs doing and what doesn't. I said, Talk to Jo about it. Napkins. You play on the swing? Yes. My Dad built it for me when we arrived in France. Why did you tell him that? Tell him what? About Chuang? It's nothing. I'll do it. I'll pick up the money. But the house, Dad's mortgage and debts... No more. We wipe the slate clean. Kiss me. Call them. Sir? Can I help you, sir? Is anybody in? The lady was there earlier. What's she like? Young. Blonde. The company's been here long? Lt's a rental. Companies come and go. Why? Is she here often? From time to time. lt's not myjob to... There's nothing that way. You'll have to leave. Coffee, please. - And the phone book. - Coming right up. Thanks. How old's this? About two years. -You have a business directory? - Hold on... Yes? Yes. I'll just get him. It's foryou. Have a good snoop round? What are you doing here? You know l'm not Cathy. Where are you? Nowhere. Do you even remember my name? Did you ever notice me? Go away, don't tryto contact me. I forbid you to! - Did you see her? - No. What are the offices like? Offices. Smart. Where? Bythe bay. Two employees, leather... Nothing to worry about. If you say so. I gave her some budgies. She barely looked at them. Even so... I ran into Fortierfrom Nice. He's never heard of her. We have to watch out. Down there, property developers are a dime a dozen. What's the address? Go see foryourself if you want. Marc, the cake's ready. Dad! That boy's a real terror. Excuse me. - What? - The ball's stuck in the tree. - Get the ladder. - No, you do it! What about that ball? I want mine! Fetch it for me! - No. -Yes! Not in the tree! You're a pain in the ass! Lt's mean to make her cry on her birthday. So make her laugh. What's wrong with you? Bossing me around at home... Gives me enough shit at work! If you don't want to be with us, go. Mandonato. Has she checked in? When did you get there? The hotel. How was the drive? It was pouring down. You have a pen? Right... Meet him at Hotel Bellerive. I described you. I only met him once. Tall, with a beard, I think. What's your room like? Not great, but it's only one night. I'm not very hungry. Lots of love. - I forgot my keys. - What are you doing? I need a file for tomorrow morning. Want to grab a bite later? If you want. I sense we're not in favor with the council. We can forget the lot near the tennis courts. The mayor plans to use it for open-air concerts or something. Ifound her, you know. What? The woman you drove up to sign the contract. We knew each other long ago. We spent the night together. When? After her first visit. You plan to see her again? Yes. You piss me off! I tell you about a dud deal and you talk about sex. Sorry, l'm tired. L'll take this and go. I got her address. She lives in Nice. You don't wanna go eat? No, l'm tired. Just a minute. Can you sign this here? I'll write it tomorrow. Write what? I, Sergio Bartoli, state that I wish to terminate my contract with Pays d'Aix Real Estate, in the knowledge that my illegal activities could lead to legal proceedings... Something like that. Succinct. What do you make her do? It's not for her. Who's it for? You don't know them. But she takes all the risks. - No. - She does. Who gets asked where the money comes from? It's her signature. She'd cop all the shit. I neverforced her. What is she to you? Should I sign first? I knew her veryyoung. We met again after her marriage. We fell in love. What's it to you? What are you gonna do? - Get the cops onto her? - Get lost! Coffee and fresh orange juice. "l was inside, my head spinning. "l had to force myself to breathe. "His kiss didn't scare me, "unlike the graduation ceremony. "When I felt his fear win out, "the calm thrill of his lips..." Marie-Jeanne! Finish up first. I can't get it right. Take the cakes home if you want. Thanks. In the doghouse? I'll be back. Tell her! Mrs. Mandonato? There's a phone call foryou. Take a seat if you want. Yes, he's here. Yes, he recognized me. No. I won't do it. I want out. You can deal with them. I'm sorry. No, it's over. If you were here right now, l'd saythe same thing. You heard me. We'll never meet again. What about him? What did you tell him? Who you were. - Okay, sweetheart? - Yes, and you? Be good. You're sleeping at Rue Vlane? Yes. We'll see. Here, Manouche. Here I am. If there's a problem, call me or drop by. - Fine. - Thanks. Goodbye. Finished for the day? Yes. No. Where shall we start? Here we have 3 reception rooms. In the last one, there's a fine mantelpiece. Beautiful, high quality local stone. Original parquet flooring. Haven't we already met? Brunette or blonde... Anyway... You often look round houses. Buythem even. This is the Chinese room. Most likely a boudoir or smoking room. Would make a nice kid's room. You have kids? No? You can make them up. Outside, there's a large patio overlooking the town. There you go. You know property prices. Wanna think it over? Talk to your adviser? There's a phone. Call him. Well? You're not sure? Make your mind up! Why say you were Cathy? You said I was. You didn't recognize me. You could've stopped it. Because... it took me back... to before. To the terrace. When I never spoke. When you never looked at me. And then... because she's dead! It was Tuesday, We'd been to the pool. Herfather picked us up. He dropped us at the street corner. We stood there a moment, joking. We had our wet swimsuits on. I don't remember if we talked about you. I saw her go upstairs with her father. I wanted to go up with them, but a man in the hall told me to go home. And then... Funny, isn't it? And when he told us to get out. Blowing his whistle... No, not you. Still in Nice? No. I've been traveling. I'm not working just now. Except... a bit of theatre. How long are you going for? I don't know. A few days. You can visit my father's store. I'll never go back. If you want to go up, go ahead. Thanks. I was looking foryou. I got lost.
