THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE ALL THE BEST OF I AND HE SHOULD TAKE ALL THE WORST OF IT. THAT'S A LAUGH. I'VE BEEN TAKING THE WORST OF EVERYTHING ALL MY LIFE. WHAT HAVE I HAD? A FATHER WHO QUI MY MOTHER AND ME WITHOUT THE PRICE OF A CUP OF COFFEE! WHILE OTHER KIDS WERE PLAYING, I WAS NURSING A RIBBON COUNTER IN A FIVE-AND-TEN. WHILE OTHER GIRLS WERE GOING TO SCHOOL DANCES, I WAS DANCING, TOO, BUT FOR NICKELS AND DIMES! OTHER GIRLS GO PROPOSALS. I NEVER GOT ANYTHING BUT PROMISES. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING GOOD THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME, EXCEPT MEETING YOU. AND I WAS READY TO TAKE THE WORST OF THAT, TOO. I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS AROUND, AND I COULDN'T STAND TO LOOK AT YOU ANYMORE WITHOUT TOUCHING YOU; BECAUSE I WAS GOING CRAZY EVERY TIME I THOUGHT OF YOU; BECAUSE I LOVE YOU. AND BECAUSE YOU AND HANK WERE FRIENDS, I WAS SETTING MYSELF UP BEHIND THE EIGHTBALL AGAIN. AND I WAS GOING TO TAKE THE WORST OF IT, AS USUAL. WELL, THAT'S WHA I WAS GOING TO DO.

YOU'RE WHAT? I'M BLOWING, CHECKING OUT OF THE CREW. WHAT FOR? WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'M TIRED OF BEING HOLED UP IN A STALE JOB LIKE THIS. THIS IS AS LONG AS I EVER STAYED IN ONE SPO SINCE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BUTTON MY OWN SHIRT. LOOK, JOHNNY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR BEEF IS, BUT WHATEVER IT IS, WE'LL FIX IT UP. THE SUBSTATION NEEDS THIS LINE TO CARRY THE LOAD. NOW GET INTO THE SHACK, GRAB YOURSELF A SLICKER, AND START CLIMBING. WHAT DO YOU SAY?
