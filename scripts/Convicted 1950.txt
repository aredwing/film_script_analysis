YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THERE HASN'T BEEN A BALLPLAYER SINCE TY COBB? THAT'S WHAT I SAID. WHO'S BEEN PLAYING THE GAME, THEN, FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS? OH, A BUNCH OF OVERGROWN SANDLOTTERS. ROUTINE HEART ATTACK. THE GUY HAD BEEN DEAD ABOUT EIGHT HOURS. I'LL MAKE OUT THE REPOR LATER. BABE RUTH WAS A SANDLOTTER? RUTH WAS A FAIR COUNTRY BALLPLAYER. WHAT ABOUT PITCHERS? I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ONE SINCE WALTER JOHNSON. WHERE YOU BEEN BURIED? HOW ABOUT HUBBELL, LEFTY GROVE, DIZZY DEAN, FELLER? WHO DID THEY PITCH AGAINST? OH, NOBODY. YOU GUYS START THIS AGAIN, I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS. SERGEANT HENRY. WHAT ABOUT DiMAGGIO? HE'S A GOOD BALLPLAYER. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE MIGHTY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT HIM. THERE'S BEEN SOME TROUBLE AT THE HAWAIIAN CLUB. SOME GUY GOT SLUGGED PRETTY BAD. THAT'S JUST AS SILLY AS SAYIN' THERE HASN'T BEEN A GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER SINCE JIM THORPE. WELL, NAME ME ONE. GENTLEMEN, THE PEOPLE OVER AT THE HAWAIIAN CLUB ARE WAITING FOR A LITTLE LAW AND ORDER. RED GRANGE, THE FOUR HORSEMEN, SID LUCKMAN, TOMMY HERMAN. NEVER HEARD OF THEM. WHAT NEWSPAPERS DO YOU READ? THERE HASN'T BEEN A GOOD NEWSPAPER SINCE THE OLD NEW YORK WORLD. HAWAIIAN CLUB. USE THE WHISTLE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE WINTERS AREN'T AS COLD AS THEY USED TO BE? WHAT ABOUT THAT BLIZZARD THAT SWEPT THE COUNTRY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO? WELL, I'LL ADMI IT WAS A LITTLE CHILLY. YEAH. BALEY, YOU KNOW HOW HARD WE TRY TO KEEP THIS A NICE, QUIET PLACE. WASN'T ANYTHING MUCH - A LITTLE ARGUMENT OVER A GIRL. BOTH OF THE BOYS HAD BEEN DRINKING. HOW IS HE? HE'S STILL OUT. THIS IS DR. MASTERSON. HE HAPPENED TO BE IN THE CLUB. I'VE CALLED FOR AN AMBULANCE. MUST HAVE HIT HIS HEAD WHEN HE WENT DOWN. WELL, WHERE'S THE STRONG HEAR WHO DID IT? YOU THE GUY WHO SLUGGED THAT FELLOW? IT WAS JUST AN ARGUMENT. THIS FELLOW WALKED UP WHILE WE WERE DANCING AND STARTED MAKING SOME REMARKS. ABOUT HER? YEAH. I DIDN'T HAVE NOTHIN' TO DO TO WITH IT. I WANT TO SEE MY LAWYER. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? YVONNA DARE. SOUNDS LIKE A CHEAP PERFUME. WELL, FELLA, YOU BETTER COME ALONG WITH US. YOU TOO. I DIDN'T LAY A GLOVE ON THE GUY! I WAS AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THE DEATH CELL - JUST TO THE POLICE STATION. Masterson: CHECK ON THAT AMBULANCE, WILL YOU? HOW'S IT COMING, DOC? HIS PULSE IS VERY WEAK. WELL, DO WHAT YOU CAN. YOU TAKE HIM ON DOWN, BALEY. I'LL ROUND UP SOME WITNESSES. I GOT MY RIGHTS! I WANT A LAWYER! YVONNE, COME ALONG LIKE A NICE LITTLE GIRL BEFORE I REMEMBER THAT I SAW YOU IN THE LINEUP TWO WEEKS AGO. NOW, THEN, KIDDIES, I WANT TO HEAR THE WHOLE STORY. NO, NO, NO, FRED, IT'S PURE ROUTINE. I KNOW IT WAS MITCHELL'S SON. THAT'S THE REASON I TOOK OVER MYSELF. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE. I'M DISTRICT ATTORNEY! CALL ME AT 5:00. I'LL GIVE YOU A STATEMENT THEN. KEEP THE PAPERS OFF MY NECK FOR A WHILE, EDDIE. MITCHELL'S A BIG MAN POLITICALLY. HAD TO PAY HIM PERSONALLY. CALL THE GIRL IN. SEND THE GIRL IN. RIGHT. THE GIRL. OKAY, SISTER, IT'S YOUR TURN. I WANT A LAWYER. I'M A LAWYER. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? I'VE GOT MY RIGHTS! SURE, YOU HAVE. SIT DOWN. I'VE GOT A DAUGHTER YOUR AGE, AND THE ONLY THING LEGS MEAN TO ME ARE SOMETHING YOU GOT TO KEEP COVERED WITH NYLON. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? YVONNA DARE. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN AND MAKE IT SOUND RIGHT. BERTHA. BERTHA WHAT? BERTHA WILLIAMS. WHERE DO YOU LIVE, BERTIE? WITH MY FOLKS - 1713 COURT STREET. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? YES, SIR. BUT LATELY, I'VE BEEN STAYING WITH A GIRLFRIEND. WHERE? 206 DOVER STREET. EVER BEEN ARRESTED? OH, NO, HONEST, I HAVEN'T. ALL RIGHT. I WANT YOU TO TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKES. I WAS SITTIN' IN THIS BAR, JUST MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS. WHAT BAR? WHAT TIME? THE HAWAIIAN CLUB - ABOUT 11:00. GO ON. WELL, THIS FELLA CAME IN, SPOKE TO ME, BOUGHT ME A DRINK. YOU'D NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE? OH, NO, HONEST, I HADN'T. WELL, AT FIRST, I WAS INSULTED. NEVER MIND THAT STUFF. ALL I WANT ARE THE FACTS. WHAT DID HE SAY THEN? HE SAID HE HADN'T BEEN IN TOWN LONG, AND HE WAS LONESOME. AND IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY. HE ASKED ME IF I'D DANCE WITH HIM. SO I THOUGHT THERE WASN' ANY HARM IN IT. AND THEN? WELL, WE WERE JUST DANCIN', AND THIS MR. MITCHELL CAME UP. YOU KNOW HIM? SORT OF. EVER BEEN OUT WITH HIM? UH-HUH. THEN WHAT DID HE DO? WELL, HE STARTED MAKIN' SOME CRACKS. HE TRIED CUTTIN' IN WHILE I WAS DANCIN' WITH THE YOUNG MAN. WHEN MY GUY WOULDN'T LET HIM, HE GOT SORE. THEN HE WANTED ME TO COME OVER TO HIS TABLE. AND WHEN I WOULDN'T, HE CALLED ME A NAME. THAT'S WHAT STARTED EVERYTHING. THE YOUNG MAN SAID, "YOU HAVE INSULTED THIS LADY." HE MEANT ME. "APOLOGIZE TO HER." THEN MR. MITCHELL LET LOOSE WITH SOME WORDS AND REACHED BACK TO HIS HIP POCKET. WHAT FOR? IT WAS ONLY FOR HIS HANDKERCHIEF. MY GUY HIT HIM. WELL, HE FELL DOWN, AND HE JUST STAYED THERE. I THINK HE HIT HIS HEAD ON SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT, BERTIE, YOU CAN GO. COME BACK AT 5:00. AND, BERTIE, DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY. OH, NO, SIR. I MEAN, YES, SIR. THAT THE LAS OF THE WITNESSES, EDDIE? Eddie: THAT'S ALL. BRING THE BOY IN. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE JOE HUFFORD? YES, SIR. SIT DOWN. CIGARETTE? NO, THANKS. DON'T SMOKE? YEAH. I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT. JOE, YOU'RE IN A PRETTY BAD SPOT. WHO HAVE YOU TALKED TO SO FAR? THE POLICE AND THE LAWYER WHO CAME TO SEE ME. WHAT DID THE LAWYER HAVE TO SAY? TOLD ME NOT TO DO ANY TALKIN'. THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. PARTICULARLY, DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO ME. MY JOB IS TO PROSECUTE YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, DON'T YOU? YEAH. YOU MIND IF I ASK A QUESTION? NO, GO AHEAD. WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT? I HAD A FEW DRINKS, AND I HIT A GUY. IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY. YOU KNOW WHO THE BOY WAS? NO, I NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE. ANYONE TOLD YOU HE DIED THIS MORNING? NOT JUST A BARROOM BRAWL NOW, JOE. A MAN IS DEAD. YOU DID IT. WELL... IT... IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT. HE'S STILL DEAD. WHEN SOMEBODY GETS KILLED, SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR IT. THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE LAW, JOE. HE STARTED IT. YOU CAN ASK ANYONE WHO WAS THERE. I HAVE. THEY TOLD ME HE STARTED IT. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS IT FROM BEING FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. IT WAS JUST A ROTTEN BREAK. HE MUST HAVE HIT HIS HEAD WHEN HE - HE DID. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE ON THE REPORT. JOE, AS YOU SAY, IT'S A ROTTEN BREAK. THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES SOMETIMES. WHO'S YOUR ATTORNEY? UM, MR. BRADLEY. THE COMPANY I WORK FOR SENT HIM OVER. YOU WORK FOR DUTMAN ELDRITCH. HOW LONG YOU BEEN WITH HIM? UH, ABOUT A MONTH. WHERE YOU FROM? PLAINFIELD. ANY FAMILY? YEAH, A FATHER. CAN HE HELP? NO, NOT VERY MUCH. ANYWAY, I WOULDN'T ASK HIM - HE'S PRETTY OLD AND NEEDS EVERYTHING HE'S GOT. DON'T YOU REALIZE YOU'RE GONNA NEED ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THIS KIND OF TROUBLE BEFORE. THAT'S THE WAY THINGS WORK OU SOMETIMES. YOU'VE GOT A GOOD WAR RECORD, NO PREVIOUS ARRESTS, BUT I'M STILL ON A JOB WHERE I HAVE TO PROSECUTE YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, DON'T YOU? NO. HOW COULD I UNDERSTAND? WELL, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. THAT'S ALL, JOE. WELL, I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE JAIL NOW AND STAND TRIAL, HUH? YEAH. YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT WAS AN ACCIDENT? I BELIEVE IT. BUT THERE'S A MAN DEAD. ACCIDENT OR NO ACCIDENT, YOU KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND KILLED HIM. Eddie: HUFFORD'S ATTORNEY'S HERE. HAVE HIM WAIT. JOE... TELL HIM TO WAIT. IS YOUR LAWYER ANY GOOD? I HAVEN'T ANY IDEA. IF HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING, YOU'LL STAND A GOOD CHANCE. ONCE WE GET INTO COURT, I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY BREAKS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? YEAH, I SUPPOSE SO. WHAT DO YOU THINK, EDDIE? TOUGH LUCK FOR HUFFORD. BUT WHO ASKED HIM TO GO OU AND GET DRUNK LAST NIGHT? WHO ASKED HIM TO GET IN A FIGHT?! SEND HIS ATTORNEY IN. SEND HIM IN. I'M VERNON BRADLEY OF BEEHAM AND BRADLEY AND NERNEY. MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME, MR. BRADLEY. THANK YOU. CARE FOR A CIGAR? UH, NO. NO, THANK YOU. BEEHAM AND BRADLEY AND NERNEY. NEVER RUN INTO YOU FELLAS BEFORE, HAVE I? NO, WE'RE CORPORATION ATTORNEYS. WANDERED A LITTLE FAR OVER ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HANDLING A CRIMINAL CASE? THE FIRM HUFFORD WORKS FOR IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST ACCOUNTS. THEY HAVE ASKED US TO HANDLE IT. I TALKED WITH MY CLIEN THIS MORNING. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, I THINK THE WHOLE THING'S VERY UNFORTUNATE. I IMAGINE THE DEAD BOY WOULD FEEL THE SAME WAY. UH... HUFFORD IMPRESSES ME AS BEING CLEAN-CUT AND SINCERE. HE'S NEVER BEEN IN ANY TROUBLE BEFORE. THE WHOLE THING MIGHT BE A CASE OF TEMPORARY INSANITY. HAVE YOU EVER ACTUALLY HANDLED A CRIMINAL CASE BEFORE? I TOLD YOU WE WERE CORPORATION ATTORNEYS. YOU ENTER A PLEA OF TEMPORARY INSANITY, YOU'LL BE LAUGHED RIGHT OUT OF COURT. I HAVE WITNESSES, MAN. HE WASN'T INSANE. HE WAS DRUNK. IT'S MY CLIENT'S RIGHT TO ENTER WHATEVER PLEA HE CHOOSES. IT'S ALSO YOUR CLIENT'S RIGH TO SERVE 20 YEARS IF HIS CASE ISN'T HANDLED RIGHT. WAIT A MINUTE. IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF YOUR FIELD. I FEEL THAT HUFFORD'S HAD A BAD BREAK. I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM GE A GOOD ONE NOW. I'LL ACCEP A PLEA OF MANSLAUGHTER. THAT'S ONE TO 10 YEARS. DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S STEEP? NO STEEPER THAN BEING DEAD ON A MORGUE SLAB. BRADLEY, THIS IS NOT LIKE REORGANIZING A COMPANY. A MAN'S DEAD. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PAY FOR IT. LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU PLAY IT SMART? WHY DON'T YOU CALL IN SOMEBODY LIKE CONWAY OR DASTRO? OUR FIRM IS NOT IN THE HABI OF CALLING IN MEN LIKE THAT. NO? DASTRO USED TO BE MY LAW PARTNER. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE KNEW OUR WAY AROUND A COURTROOM. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I'D HANDLE THIS CASE IF I WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE? I'D OBJECT ON ANY JUROR THAT DIDN'T HAVE A SON IN THE SERVICE. I'D DRAG OUT HIS WAR RECORD. I'D SPEND TWO DAYS ON IT. I'D TAKE IT FROM THE DAY HE ENTERED BOOT CAMP TO THE DAY HE GOT HIS DECORATION IN OKINAWA. THEN I'D PULL IN 50 CHARACTER WITNESSES, FROM THE OLD LADY WHO'S KNOWN HIM SINCE HE WAS BORN TO HIS LAS COMMANDING OFFICER. THEN I'D START IN ON INTENT. WAS THERE ANY INTENT? I'D HARP ON IT TILL IT WAS COMING OUT OF THE JUDGE'S EARS. YOU GOT ALL OF THAT, EDDIE? I'LL GIVE YOU A COPY. THANK YOU, MR. KNOWLAND, BU I DON'T THINK I SHALL NEED IT. IT'S A LITTLE EMOTIONAL FOR ME. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THA THE LAW IS PRETTY WELL STATED, AND THAT THE LESS EMOTION BROUGHT INTO IT, THE BETTER. THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTION CONNECTED WITH KILLING SOMEBODY. SEEING YOUR CLIENT GO UP FOR A FEW YEARS HAS EVEN MORE. WE SHALL TRY TO SEE TO IT THA THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. GOODBYE, MR. KNOWLAND. AND THANK YOU. THERE GOES A FIRST-CLASS, DOUBLE-BREASTED OVERSTUFFED IDIOT! YEAH. TOO BAD FOR HUFFORD. YEAH. HERE'S A CASE A JUNIOR LAW CLERK COULD WIN WITH AN I.Q. OF 50. WHAT NOW, BOSS? TYPE THAT UP. WE'LL PUT A COPY IN THE MAIL TO BRADLEY ANYWAY. YOU'VE BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF KILLING YOUR FELLOW MAN. MURDER WAS NOT YOUR INTENT, BUT DRUNKENNESS IS NO EXCUSE FOR VIOLATION OF THE LAW. THEREFORE, IT'S THE SENTENCE OF THIS COUR THAT YOU, JOE HUFFORD, BE IMPRISONED IN THE STATE PRISON FOR A TERM FROM ONE TO 10 YEARS. COURT IS ADJOURNED. EDDIE, I'VE HEARD OF PEOPLE BEING RAILROADED, BUT NEVER BY THEIR OWN ATTORNEY. I HEARD THAT, MR. KNOWLAND. GOOD. IT'S THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE HEARD. YOU FUMBLED EVERY CHANCE I THREW YOU. EVEN THE JUDGE WAS TRYING TO HELP, AND YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN. LUCKY THEY DON'T CONVICT LAWYERS FOR INCOMPETENCE. IF THERE WAS ANYTHING - I'M SORRY, SON. I GUESS IT COULDN'T BE HELPED, DAD. I'LL BE UP TO SEE YOU WHENEVER THEY'LL LET ME. AND, JOE, I KNOW THIS ISN'T MUCH HELP, BUT... I'LL TRY TO HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU TO COME OUT TO. WELL, THAT'LL HELP A LOT. SO LONG. SEE YOU SOON, THEN. HOW DO YOU FEEL, DAD? LIKE GOING OU AND GETTING DRUNK. IT WAS PRETTY BAD. IT'S THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW YOU TRY TO LOSE A CASE. I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT, I GUESS. HOW ABOUT LUNCH? SURE. YOU KNOW, I'D SELL THIS JOB MIGHTY CHEAP RIGHT NOW. NO, I WON'T PLAY CASINO WITH YOU. WHY DON'T YOU LEARN SOME OF THE NEW GAMES? THEY DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T WAN TO PLAY OLD MAID. THIS GUY DOESN'T THINK ANYTHING'S HAPPENED SINCE McKINLEY GOT SHOT. IF YOU TRY TO TALK ABOUT ROOSEVELT, HE THINKS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ROUGHRIDERS. HOW'D YOU TWO GRAB THIS GRAVY TRIP? OH, I GOT SENIORITY. I LIKE TO HAVE HIM ALONG TO ARGUE WITH. YOU GOT A CIGARETTE? YEAH. YOU'LL GET USED TO IT. HOW LONG YOU UP FOR? ONE TO 10. JUST A HOLIDAY WEEKEND. YOU BEEN THERE BEFORE? THE BOYS RUN A REGULAR SHUTTLE SERVICE FOR ME. WELL, YOU DON'T SEEM TO MIND IT. I MIND PLENTY. WAIT TILL YOUR NEXT TRIP. WHO SAYS HE HAS TO MAKE MORE THAN ONE TRIP? I WASN'T PLANNING ON I MYSELF. WELL, THAT'S TOUGH, MALLOBY, BUT YOU DID BREAK PAROLE. ONLY DOUGLAS WOULD'VE REPORTED IT - OR SHOULD I SAY CAPTAIN DOUGLAS? CAPTAIN DOUGLAS, YOU'RE WANTED IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS, YOU DON'T TOUCH THE MACHINES, UNDERSTAND? COME ON. SHOW HIM WHAT TO DO WITH THE HAMPER. YES, SIR. AND NO TALKING. FILL IT UP. RIGHT FACE! FORWARD! IF THEY'D ONLY DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT JUST ONCE. BE TWO MINUTES LATE LOCKIN' THE DOORS, FORGET TO RING A BELL. IT'S LIKE LOCKIN' UP ANIMALS. YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE SIX MONTHS. YOU JUST DON'T APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THEY DO FOR YOU HERE. SURE, JOE, YOU WANT A LOT OF NOSY STRANGERS COMIN' AROUND ALL NIGHT? AND WOMEN BOTHERING YOU AT ALL HOURS? YOU HAVE A BAD DAY AT THE OFFICE? I SOLD EVERYTHING I MADE. THAT'S THE IDEA, JOE. YOU JUST KEEP WORKIN' AWAY IN THE LAUNDRY, KEEP YOUR NOSE TO THE WET WASH, SO TO SPEAK, AND ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF AT THE TOP. DOES IT SMELL ANY BETTER THAN AT THE BOTTOM? HOW LONG CAN A GUY LAS IN THAT PLACE? I NEVER KNEW ANYONE WHO WANTED TO TRY FOR THE RECORD. LOOK, JOE, YOU COULD STILL GET A BREAK. AFTER YOU'VE SERVED SIX MONTHS, IT'S UP TO THE PAROLE BOARD AS TO HOW LONG YOU STAY IN HERE. YEAH, I KNOW. I COME UP BEFORE THE BOARD FOR SENTENCE TOMORROW. HOW DO YOU KNOW? PONTI TOLD ME. ARE YOU PALLING AROUND WITH PONTI NOW? HE PASSED ME A NOTE. DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT GUY. WHEN HE HANDS YOU A FAVOR WITH ONE HAND, HE KNIFES YOU WITH THE OTHER. NEVER MIND THAT. THE IMPORTANT THING IS JOE'S SENTENCE. WHY, HE COULD BE OUT OF HERE IN A LITTLE WHILE IF THEY'D TAKE IT EASY ON HIM. WHAT'S THE USUAL SENTENCE? THE USUAL DOESN'T MATTER. THE LAW SAYS ONE TO TEN YEARS. WELL, TWO YEARS IS BETWEEN ONE AND TEN. SO'S NINE. MAYBE YOU'LL GET A BREAK. LIKE YOU DID, HUH? IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT WAY. SURE, JOE. YOU'VE ALREADY DONE SIX MONTHS. SIX MONTHS. I SPENT FOUR YEARS IN THE ARMY - DIDN'T SEEM HALF AS LONG AS SIX MONTHS IN HERE. THE CASE OF JOE HUFFORD. MANSLAUGHTER. YES, I WENT OVER THIS CASE LAST NIGHT. THERE WERE CERTAIN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. I FELT THAT, TOO. THE BOY HE KILLED WAS OLD JOHN MITCHELL'S SON. WELL, IT LOOKS PRETTY RUN-OF-THE-MILL. I THOUGHT FIVE YEARS. THAT MAKES HIM ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE IN THREE. FIVE YEARS. 151 OKAY... 152 OKAY... 153 OKAY... 154 OKAY... 155 OKAY. FROM YOUR FATHER, JOE? NO, IT'S FROM THE PEOPLE HE'S STAYING WITH. HOW IS HE? NOT SO GOOD. HE HASN'T BEEN OUTTA BED FOR THREE WEEKS. ARE YOU REALLY GONNA TRY TO BREAK OUTTA HERE? SURE. WHEN? I WAS TALKIN' TO PONTI TODAY. WE FIGURE A WEEK FROM NEXT WEDNESDAY. YOU GOIN' AHEAD WITH PONTI AFTER EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU? YOU NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM. I'LL TELL YOU PLENTY OF THINGS. I'VE KNOWN THAT RA FOR 15 YEARS. WE DID TIME ONCE BEFORE TOGETHER. YEAH, I KNOW THAT. DO YOU KNOW HOW HE GOT OUT? HE SAID HE BUSTED OUT. THAT'S A HOWL. HE WAS IN ON A BREAK, SURE. BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME, THERE WAS 20 GUARDS WITH MACHINE GUNS WAITIN' FOR THEM. THEY WENT DOWN LIKE LEAD SOLDIERS. HOW DID PONTI GET AWAY? THROUGH THE WARDEN'S OFFICE WITH A PAROLE IN HIS HAND. HE SQUEALED. THAT WAS THE GENERAL IMPRESSION AT THE TIME. ALL RIGHT, HE'S OUT. THANKS, MALLOBY. HOW 'BOUT ME BEIN' IN? YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ELSE. YOU'RE UP FOR PAROLE IN A FEW MONTHS. WHAT GOOD IS THAT GONNA DO IF MY FATHER DIES FIRST? YOU'LL BE BACK HERE FOR LIFE IF YOU TRY A CRAZY STUN LIKE THAT. I'VE GOTTA SEE HIM. HOW ABOUT IT, MAPES? Look out! WHAT'D YOU DO LAST NIGHT, MAPES? OH, NOTHIN' MUCH. CALLED UP A COUPLE GIRLS, WENT OUT TO DINNER. THEN WE HAD A FEW DRINKS AT THE MACAMBO. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WE WERE MAKIN' THE ROUNDS, TOO, WEREN'T WE, JOE? YEAH. WHO'D YOU HAVE WITH YOU? WHO CAN REMEMBER NAMES? THEY WERE ALL SOCIETY GIRLS FROM PASADENA. NEXT TIME, GIVE ME A CALL. I'LL BE GLAD TO GO ALONG. THESE GIRLS WAN CHARACTER REFERENCES. MALLOBY, SOMETIMES I THINK YOU FORGE WHICH SIDE OF THE BARS YOU'RE ON. NO, DOUGLAS, THAT'S SOMETHING I NEVER FORGET. KEEP IT QUIET IN HERE. I THINK HE'S KIND OF AFRAID OF YOU. I DON'T BLAME HIM. YOU'LL NEVER GET HIM. HE WATCHES YOU EVERY SECOND. THERE'LL BE ONE OR TWO WHEN HE FORGETS... JUST LIKE I FORGO OUT ON PAROLE ONE DAY... ONE LOUSY DAY. DOUGLAS SEES ME HAVIN' A BEER WITH AN OLD FRIEND. HE REPORTS ME BECAUSE THE OLD FRIEND IS AN EX-CON. BACK FOR 12 YEARS - 12 YEARS FOR ONE LITTLE BEER. LET'S PLAY SOME CARDS. HOW ABOU MY TAKING PONTI'S PLACE? LEAVE HIM OUT OF IT, MAPES. I MEAN IT. NOW, LOOK - YOU HEARD ME, MAPES. SURE. YOU IN ON THE BREAK, JOE? DON'T YOU KNOW, PONTI? WELL, I THOUGH YOU KNEW EVERYTHING. WE'RE ALL SET FOR FRIDAY. The guns are in the laundry room. WHY FRIDAY? I THOUGH WE WERE GOIN' WEDNESDAY. PONTI'S OUT. HE KNOWS ABOUT WEDNESDAY. YOU SURE HE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE? HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? THOUGHT YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND. NOT A CHANCE. YOU BEEN SPREADING SOME RUMORS ABOUT ME? YEAH. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LAY OFF? BECAUSE YOU'D SET FIRE TO YOUR SISTER FOR A DIME. LOOK OUT. SO I SAYS TO THIS PREACHER, REVEREND, I'LL BE GLAD TO ORGANIZE A CHOIR FOR YOU, BUT WHAT'S OUR ANGLE ON THE DEAL? COME ON, GET UP. KEEP MOVIN'. YOU'RE LIKE A BUNCH OF OLD WOMEN WHEN YOU GET SOME NEWS. WHO'S GOT ANY NEWS? DON'T TELL ME YOU AIN'T HEARD WE'RE GETTIN' A NEW WARDEN. WHEN? THIS WEEK. AND GUESS WHO HE IS - YOUR OLD FRIEND GEORGE KNOWLAND. WHO SENT HIM UP? PROBABLY OLD JOHN MITCHELL. KNOWLAND WAS GETTIN' TOO BIG IN STATE POLITICS, AND BEING WARDEN IS A ONE-WAY TRIP TO NOPLACE. COME ON, BREAK IT UP. YEAH, MOVE ON. WATCH YOUR STEP, MALLOBY. WE'RE NOT ALL A BUNCH OF FOOLS AROUND HERE. I'D LIKE TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THAT SOMETIME, CAPTAIN. ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO. GET BACK TO IT. I SAID GO BACK TO WORK! COME ON. GET BACK TO WORK. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? DID HE START IT? HE SURE DID. THROW HIM IN SOLITARY AND DON'T BE TOO EASY ON HIM. START THE MACHINES. AND GET BACK TO WORK. STALEY, NUMBER FOUR. HUFFORD, NUMBER THREE. SOLITARY. NO, HE DIDN'T. HOLD IT. HERE HE IS NOW. YOU'RE WANTED IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE, CAPTAIN. HAVING ANY TROUBLE WITH HUFFORD? NO. LET ME KNOW IF YOU DO. YES. NOW, JUST STOP WORRYING. Man: THIS IS WHERE YOUR CLERICAL WORK IS DONE AND YOUR FILES ARE KEPT. IT'S QUITE HANDY. WHAT DO YOU THINK, KAY? WELL, IT'S THE BIGGEST OFFICE YOU'VE EVER HAD. YOU'LL FIND I VERY COMFORTABLE, GEORGE - CENTRALLY LOCATED WITH EVERYTHING UNDER YOUR CONTROL. THIS BRIDGE IS AN ADDITION. WHERE'S IT GO? THAT LEADS TO YOUR LIVING QUARTERS. OF COURSE, THERE'S A GOOD LOCK ON THE OTHER DOOR. VERY CONVENIENT. HELLO, DOUGLAS. HOW DO YOU DO, MR. MACKAY? YOUR NEW BOSS, GEORGE KNOWLAND. HAPPY TO KNOW YOU, DOUGLAS. DOUGLAS IS THE BEST YARD CAPTAIN IN THE PRISON BUSINESS. I'M GONNA HAVE TO RELY ON YOU A LOT. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR. HEAR YOU HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE THIS MORNING. ONE OF THE YOUNGER, TOUGHER ONES - WE TOOK CARE OF HIM. I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU MEE MY DAUGHTER. THIS IS KAY. HELLO. THIS IS OUR HOUSEKEEPER, MISS LORRY. PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL US, MR. DOUGLAS. JUST HOW SAFE WILL WE BE HERE? WHY, MA'AM, THERE'S NO PLACE SAFER. THE WALLS ARE 8 FEET THICK, AND YOU'VE GOT GUARDS ALL AROUND. I'M SURE WE'LL MANAGE ALL RIGHT, MARTHA. AND JUST THINK, MISS LORRY - YOU HAVE BETTER HELP THAN YOU COULD HIRE AT AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY. BRING THEM IN, DOUGLAS. AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS, TO END UP IN A PRISON... ALL RIGHT. IN HERE. HOW OFTEN DOES YOUR PAROLE BOARD MEET, MACKAY? TWICE A WEEK. YOUR HOUSEHOLD STAFF, GEORGE. THIS IS MELREAU, YOUR COOK. HE USED TO BE HEAD CHEF A THE RICHMOND PLAZA IN NEW YORK. WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR, MELREAU? I POISONED MY WIFE. OH! I TRUS YOU HAVE OTHER HOBBIES NOW? YES, SIR. THIS IS GRANT - WAS THE WARDEN'S CHAUFFEUR. A GOOD BOY - OUR BOARD APPROVED HIS PAROLE. HE GETS OUT NEXT WEEK. YOU WOULDN'T LIKE TO STAY OVER FOR A WHILE, WOULD YOU, GRANT? EVERY BOY HAS TO GROW UP AND LEAVE HOME SOMETIME, SIR. THIS IS YOUR BARBER. HELLO, CURLY. HELLO, MR. KNOWLAND. I SENT YOU UP HERE, DIDN'T I? FOR LIFE, SIR. NOW YOU'RE MY BARBER. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT. I WOULDN'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE. I LIKE CLOSE SHAVES. JUST LEAVE THA TO ME, SIR. AND THIS IS MALLOBY, YOUR HOUSEBOY AND BUTLER. ACCORDING TO HIS RECORD, HE USED TO DO THAT KIND OF WORK WHEN HE WAS CASING A JOINT. HE WAS SO GOOD SOME OF THE PEOPLE HE ROBBED DIDN'T WANNA PROSECUTE. YOU KNOW WHY? THEY WANTED HIM TO STAY ON. THOSE ARE VERY FINE REFERENCES, MALLOBY. HE'S HERE WITHOU MY RECOMMENDATIONS, WARDEN. WHY? I DON'T THINK HE'S TO BE TRUSTED. Malloby: WARDEN PAXTON THOUGHT SO. WELL, I DON'T THINK I'LL BE MAKING ANY CHANGES RIGHT AWAY. THAT'S ALL, MEN. THANKS. ALWAYS FOR ME, AREN'T YOU, CAPTAIN? THERE ARE ALL YOUR BOYS, GEORGE. HE HAD ME SENT UP FOR FIVE YEARS. HE WASN'T D.A. DURING MY TIME. THERE HE IS NOW. THE YELLOW RA IS STAYIN' HOLED UP. DON'T I WISH HE'D COME AROUND HERE. HIS THROAT - THAT'S WHERE I'D LIKE TO PUT MY HANDS. YOU MUST HAVE SEN A FEW HUNDRED UP HERE YOURSELF. I SUPPOSE I DID. THAT'S HOW YOU MADE YOUR RECORD. NOW YOU CAN MAKE ANOTHER ONE BY KEEPING THEM UNDER CONTROL. I DON'T MAKE RECORDS, MAC. I JUST DO JOBS. SURE, I KNOW, GEORGE, BUT I WAS JUST THINKING THAT A GOOD SHOWING WON'T HURT YOU WHEN THE ELECTION COMES AROUND. WHAT IS THAT, DOUGLAS? THEY CALL IT "YAMMERING." THEY DO I WHEN THEY'RE SORE. I BETTER GO DOWN. I'LL GO WITH YOU. I WOULDN'T GO IF I WERE YOU. YOU BETTER STAY HERE. WHY? IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS MUSIC IS BEING STAGED FOR YOUR BENEFIT. THAT'S RIGHT, MR. KNOWLAND. KIND OF A PROTEST, HUH? WAIT A MINUTE, GEORGE. THIS IS BAD MEDICINE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING TO 'EM, WARDEN. NO? YOU STAY HERE, DOUGLAS. HELLO, TEX. HI, UH... MR. KNOWLAND. SEE YOU AGAIN, TEX. WE'RE ALL SE FOR TONIGHT. WANT IN ON IT, MALLOBY? I STILL HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS. WE CAN'T MISS. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE SEEN IT TRIED. THEY ALWAYS GO OUT EAGER, AND THEY ALWAYS COME BACK DEAD. I PROMISED JOE - I THOUGH I TOLD YOU TO LAY OFF HIM. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? HE'S IN SOLITARY ANYWAY. I JUST WANTED YOU TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I COULDN'T WAIT. LUCKY FOR HIM. I'LL TELL HIM. I HOPE YOU MAKE IT, MAPES. GUARD... GUARD! SHUT UP IN THERE! WHAT DAY IS IT? WHAT DO YOU CARE? WILL YOU JUST PLEASE TELL ME WHAT DAY IT IS? IT AIN'T DAY. IT'S NIGHT - FRIDAY NIGHT. NOW SHUT UP! Capt. Douglas: ATTENTION. THE WARDEN HAS ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS THAT, IN VIEW OF THE ATTEMPTED BREAK LAST NIGHT, THE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE DAY ARE CANCELED. Mackay: AND EVERYBODY'S VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THE WAY YOU HANDLED THE BREAK. WHO'S "EVERYBODY"? WELL, THE NEWSPAPER... THE PEOPLE WHO COUNT. THAT'S NICE. I LEFT THE LIST HERE ON THE DESK, GEORGE. GO OVER I AS SOON AS YOU CAN. I WILL. OH, MAC... HAVE THE OFFICE TELL DOUGLAS I WANNA SEE HIM RIGHT AWAY. SURE. SEE YOU SOON, GEORGE. WHAT'D I SEND YOU UP FOR, CURLY? CUTTING A MAN'S THROAT. CLOSE ENOUGH, WARDEN? YEAH. TELL ME, CURLY, WHAT'S BETWEEN MALLOBY AND DOUGLAS? THEY DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER. WHY? I HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO KEEP UP ON EVERYTHING, WARDEN. I'VE ONLY GOT 99 YEARS TO GO. THE MEN LIKE DOUGLAS? NO. YOU WANT TO SEE ME, WARDEN? YEAH. THAT'S ALL, CURLY. YOU CAN PICK YOUR STUFF UP LATER. YES, SIR. MACKAY BROUGHT A LIST OF MEN NEXT IN LINE FOR PAROLE. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME WITH IT. SURE, WARDEN. I PROBABLY KNOW SOME OF 'EM. HANSON, DEXTER, HUFFORD - HUFFORD? HE'S THE ONE WE HAD TROUBLE WITH LAST WEEK. HE JUST GOT OU OF SOLITARY TODAY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HIS RECORD. Capt. Douglas: HIS CARD WON'T BE UP TO DATE. HUFFORD - I THINK I KNOW HIM. OH, SURE. I SENT HIM UP. WHAT WAS HIS TROUBLE? FIGHTING A GUARD. WE FOUND OUT LATER HE'D JUST GOTTEN A TELEGRAM HIS OLD MAN HAD DIED - GUESS HE WENT A LITTLE NUTS. THEN WHY WAS HE KEP IN SOLITARY UNTIL TODAY? WELL, FIGHTING A GUARD IS SERIOUS, WARDEN. I WANNA SEE ALL OF THESE MEN, AND I WANNA GO OVER THEIR RECORDS. WARDEN PAXTON GENERALLY LEFT THAT TO ME. FROM NOW ON, WE'LL DO I TOGETHER, DOUGLAS. YES, SIR. WHAT ABOU THE FUNERAL SERVICES FOR THOSE MEN THAT TRIED TO BREAK OUT? I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. IT MAY LEAD TO TROUBLE. WE'LL TAKE THAT CHANCE. SEND FOR HUFFORD. DOUGLAS... HAVE SOMEBODY PICK ME UP A SAFETY RAZOR. YES, SIR. SO, THEY FINALLY DUG YOU UP, HUH? YEAH. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, KID. HOW WAS IT - KINDA ROUGH? WELL, I DIDN'T GET SICK FROM OVEREATING. I SENT A CANDY BAR DOWN WITH NICK. I KNOW. THEY FOUND IT. NOW NICK'S DOING A FEW DAYS DOWN THERE HIMSELF. WHAT HAPPENED ON THE BREAK? PONTI SQED. DOUGLAS AND HIS MEN WERE WAITIN' FOR 'EM. THEY GOT 'EM ALL. YOU WEREN'T SO BAD OFF WHERE YOU WERE AFTER ALL. WHAT HAPPENED TO PONTI? THEY GOT HIM WORKIN' IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE. THEY'RE TRYIN' TO GET HIM TRANSFERRED. HE'LL NEVER GET OU ALIVE. THEN MAPES IS DEAD. HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. HOW CAN YOU KNOW ANYTHING? IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME. THE GOOD GUYS GET I IN THE NECK, AND THE RATS GET THE GRAVY. MAPES IS DEAD, AND PONTI HAS A SOFT JOB IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE. I DON'T THINK IT'LL LAST TOO LONG. HUFFORD, COME ON. YOU'RE WANTED IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE. WHAT'S HE WANTED FOR? THE WARDEN NEEDS A FOURTH AT BRIDGE. HE DIDN'T CHECK WITH ME TO SEE IF IT WAS OKAY. ALL RIGHT, WISEGUY. COME ON. HE DON'T LOOK SO GOOD, DOES HE? HE'LL BE ALL RIGH AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS OF FOOD. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT PONTI? MAKE HIS DEATH AS PAINLESS AS POSSIBLE. YOU'VE GOTTA GET ME OUTTA HERE, WARDEN. I KNOW THESE GUYS. I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PLANNIN'. ALL RIGHT. PONTI, CALM DOWN. I CAN'T BE CALM. HOW CAN YOU BE CALM WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE AND EVERY ONE OF THEM JUST WAITIN' THE CHANCE TO STICK A SHIV IN YOUR BACK? YOU'RE NOT SITTIN' IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM. THERE'S 8 FEET OF WALL AND 100 GUARDS BETWEEN YOU. THAT AIN'T WHA HE PROMISED ME. HE SAID I'D GET OUT OF HERE. HE PROMISED ME I'D GET OUT. YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO PROMISE HIM ANYTHING, DOUGLAS. IT'S UP TO THE PAROLE BOARD, YOU KNOW THAT. YOU DEAL WITH THESE THINGS THE BEST WAY YOU CAN, WARDEN. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE BEST WAY. I'VE NEVER MADE DEALS WITH MEN LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE. ALL RIGHT. WHAT HAPPENS TO ME NOW? I'M GONNA TRY AND GET YOU TRANSFERRED. WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO? THEY'LL BE WAITIN' FOR ME THERE! ANY PRISON, ANY PLACE! YOU'VE GOTTA LET ME OUT. GET THIS THROUGH YOUR HEAD, PONTI, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOU THE DEAL YOU AND DOUGLAS MADE. I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN. WARDEN, YOU DON'T KNOW THESE MEN. I THINK I DO - THAT'S WHY I'M KEEPING YOU UP HERE WORKING IN THE OFFICE, HAVING YOUR FOOD SENT IN. I'LL EVEN LET YOU SLEEP UP HERE, BUT KEEP AWAY FROM ME, PONTI, I CAN'T STAND A WHINER. BUT, WARDEN - THAT'S ALL, DOUGLAS. CAPTAIN, YOU PROMISED! COME ON. YOU KNOW YOU PROMISED ME. HUFFORD, SIR. YOU WANTED TO SEE HIM. I'LL SEE HIM ALONE. HELLO, JOE. MR. KNOWLAND. COME IN. SIT DOWN. CIGARETTE? I HAVE SOME. THANKS. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, JOE. SEEMS THAT WAY TO ME, TOO. I'VE BEEN LOOKING OVER YOUR RECORD - YOU'VE DONE PRETTY WELL HERE. IF YOU CAN CALL SOLITARY DOIN' PRETTY WELL. THE GUARD DIDN'T KNOW YOUR FATHER HAD DIED, JOE. WOULD IT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE IF HE DID? I THINK SO. I DON'T. THIS IS A BIG PLACE. IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF EVERYBODY'S PERSONAL PROBLEMS. YOU MANAGE TO KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING ELSE. IT WAS A BAD BREAK. I CAN BE SOME HELP. I CAN KEEP IT OFF YOUR RECORD WHEN YOU COME UP FOR PAROLE. THAT'S HARDLY IN THE LINE OF DUTY, IS IT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I REMEMBER YOU TELLING ME A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT YOU HAD A JOB TO DO. NO MATTER HOW THE CARDS FALL, THAT'S THE WAY YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM. YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. IF I WERE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AGAIN AND YOUR CASE CAME UP, I'D PROSECUTE YOU AGAIN. THEN WHY BOTHER TO KEEP ANYTHING OFF MY RECORD? I SAID PROSECUTE, NOT PERSECUTE. YOU WERE PRETTY CRAZY ABOUT YOUR FATHER, WEREN'T YOU? OF COURSE I WAS. MY DAUGHTER CALLED ON HIM AFTER THE TRIAL. I KNOW. HE WROTE ME. DON'T YOU THINK HE'D WANT YOU TO PULL OUT OF THIS, GO AHEAD AND MAKE A LIFE FOR YOURSELF? I HAVEN'T ANY IDEA WHAT HE'D WANT. JOE, HAVEN'T YOU SOME KIND OF FAITH OR RELIGION? YEAH. I DID HAVE. IT KIND OF SPRUNG A FEW LEAKS IN THIS PLACE. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS WHEN YOU GET OUT OF HERE? I HAVEN'T ANY. CAN YOU DRIVE A CAR? I USED TO. ARE YOU BUSY? STEP IN HERE FOR A MINUTE, HUH? JOE, OTHER MEN HAVE HAD LOTS WORSE BREAKS THAN YOU, BUT THEY'VE COME THROUGH THEM. HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW? YOU'VE GOT A LOT BEHIND YOU FOR 29. YOU GO A LOT AHEAD OF YOU, TOO. ARE YOU GONNA LE EVERYTHING GET YOU DOWN? I HAVEN'T LE ANYTHING HAPPEN. IT'S JUST GONE AHEAD AND DONE IT. KAY, YOU REMEMBER JOE HUFFORD? YES. I'M SORRY ABOUT THE TRIAL. JOE'S GONNA BE OUR NEW CHAUFFEUR. THIS MAKES YOU A TRUSTEE, JOE. YOU'LL DRIVE ME AND MY DAUGHTER, DO ERRANDS. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST JOBS HERE. I KNOW. SEND IN A GUARD. YOU CAN START TOMORROW. I'LL TELL CAPTAIN DOUGLAS. THAT'S ALL, JOE. THANKS. HE DOESN'T SEEM THE SAME, DOES HE? NO, HE DOESN'T. HE'LL BE COMING UP FOR PAROLE BEFORE TOO LONG. I THOUGHT THIS JOB MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA - HELP HIM TO READJUST HIMSELF. YOU COULD HELP, TOO, IF YOU WOULD. HOW? WELL, HE'S GOING TO BE DRIVING YOU A LOT. TREAT HIM - TREAT HIM MORE LIKE SOMEONE YOU KNOW RATHER THAN A CONVICT. DRAW HIM OUT - MAKE HIM TALK ABOUT HIMSELF. ALL RIGHT. YOU STILL HAVE HIM ON YOUR CONSCIENCE A LITTLE BIT, HAVEN'T YOU? NO. IT ISN'T THAT. IT'S JUST THAT HE'S GONNA BE GETTING OUT OF HERE SOON, AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT HE'S READY FOR IT. SURE, DAD. I'LL BE GLAD TO HELP. WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE TOO INTERESTED IN KNOWING HER, ANYWAY. WHAT'D SHE THINK I WAS GONNA DO, STRANGLE HER? IN A PRISON TOWN, YOU'D THINK THEY'D BE USED TO UNIFORMS. NOT MANY OF US HAVE A CHANCE TO GET OUT AND PARADE AROUND. DID IT BOTHER YOU MUCH? IT'S ALL RIGHT. GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO SCARE THEIR CHILDREN WITH TONIGHT. HOW DO YOU LIKE THE CAR? THEY'VE DONE A LOT TO THEM IN 3 YEARS. JOE, YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER WAS A FINE MAN. I KNOW. WHEN I WENT TO SEE HIM, I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID HE'D RESENT ME. HE WAS NEVER LIKE THAT. WHY DID YOU GO TO SEE HIM? I DON'T KNOW. I SAW HIM IN THE COURTROOM DURING THE TRIAL. HE LOOKED SO NICE, AND SO BROKENHEARTED WHEN YOU - HE REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR CALL. I'VE ALWAYS MEANT TO THANK YOU FOR IT WHEN I GOT OUT. NOW YOU'VE DONE IT. TAKE THE LONG WAY BACK IF YOU'D LIKE, JOE. THANKS, MISS KNOWLAND. NO. THANK YOU. TELL MELREAU I THINK THIS POT ROAST IS WONDERFUL. I TASTED IT, SIR, AND I TOLD HIM MYSELF. YOU MIGHT TELL HIM I ENJOYED IT, TOO. YES, SIR. HOW'D IT GO TODAY? NOT SO GOOD. WE'VE GOT TO GET JOE OUT OF THAT PRISON UNIFORM NEXT TIME WE GO INTO TOWN. WHAT HAPPENED? THEY DIDN'T MAKE HIM FEEL TOO WELCOME. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THA MYSELF. WE'LL HAVE TO GET HIM SOME KIND OF REGULAR SUIT. WHAT'S THE MATTER, MARTHA? YOU'RE NOT EATING MUCH. I FIXED MYSELF A LITTLE SNACK ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. WHY? WELL, YOU CAN TRUST THAT COOK IF YOU WANT TOO, BUT WHEN I THINK OF HIS POOR, DEAD WIFE - POISONED, GASPING FOR BREATH... WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER GOOD MEAL SHOT. THANKS. WELL, JOE, HOW ARE THINGS IN THE GREAT OUTSIDE WORLD? PEOPLE ARE STILL LIVING, EATING, DYING, HAVING BABIES. THEY'RE JUST ONE UP ON US. NICE JOB - DRIVING A PRETTY GIRL AROUND ALL DAY IN HER OLD MAN'S CAR. I KNOW GUYS THAT WOULD BREAK IN HERE FOR A JOB LIKE THAT. HOW DO YOU GET ALONG? ALL RIGHT. NO BETTER THAN JUST ALL RIGHT? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? I'M NOT EVEN HIRED HELP. YOU'RE NO SO BAD-LOOKIN', JOE. NOTHIN' TO WHAT I WAS WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, BUT STILL NOT TOO BAD. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME. BACK IN 1910- TELL US ABOUT IT SOME NIGHT, CURLY. HOW ABOUT PLAYIN' SOME CARDS? Tell me, Joe, did you run into Ponti lately? JUST ONCE. HE'S SCARED STIFF. HE'S GOT REASON TO BE. Shh! YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING TO PONTI. I THINK IT CAN BE HANDLED WHEN THE TIME COMES. WHEN'S THE TIME? RIGHT SOON. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. NO, WE WON'T. WE'RE KEEPING HIM OUT OF IT. GIVE ME ONE. WHERE DO YOU WANT THEM, MISS KNOWLAND? JUST PUT THEM ON THE SINK, JOE. WHERE IS EVERYBODY? THEY'RE PROBABLY AT THE BALLGAME. WHERE? TWO OF OUR TEAMS ARE PLAYING IN THE YARD TODAY. EVERYBODY GETS OU TO SEE THEM. I'M SORRY, JOE. IF I HAD KNOWN, I COULD HAVE DRIVEN MYSELF TODAY. I'VE SEEN PLENTY OF BASEBALL GAMES. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD STAR GETTING THINGS READY FOR DINNER. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. IF YOU LIKE, I'LL DO THE POTATOES. AT THE LOSS OF HOW MANY FINGERS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE TALKING TO A MAN WHO WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH COLLEGE. JOE, DID YOU KNOW THAT DAD'S WORKING ON YOUR PAROLE? YEAH. HE TOLD ME. HE THINKS THE BOARD SHOULD ACT ON IT IN A COUPLE WEEKS. YOU DON'T SEEM VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. IT ISN'T THAT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT AM I GONNA DO WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE? WHO'S GONNA TAKE A CHANCE WITH ME? CAN'T YOU GO BACK TO THE FIRM YOU WERE WORKING FOR? I DON'T THINK THEY'RE TOO INTERESTED IN EX-CONS IN A BROKERAGE HOUSE. WHY SHOULD IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THEM? IT'S ALL OVER AND DONE WITH - YOU'VE ALREADY PAID WHATEVER DEBT YOU OWED. WOULD YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT? OF COURSE I WOULD. JOE, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE MUCH WORSE THAN YOU DID WALKING THE STREETS RIGHT NOW. BUT WITHOUT A RECORD. ALL THE GUYS I'VE TALKED TO TELL ME IT'S NO CINCH. THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THEM END UP BACK HERE. YOU WON'T. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. THAT ISN'T THE QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT AM I GONNA DO? I'M NOT EVEN A CITIZEN ANYMORE. IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. WHAT WERE YOU STUDYING BEFORE THE WAR? BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. I'LL TALK TO DAD ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT HIS PROBLEM. MAYBE IT IS. IT REALLY WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU ABOUT ME? NOT A BIT. IT MIGHT BE VERY IMPORTAN TO ME SOMEDAY. IF IT IS, THEN YOU CAN COUNT ON IT. I DON'T LIKE IT, WARDEN. THE WHOLE PRISON'S TOO QUIET. BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE UP TO SOMETHING. PONTI? SURE. THEY WOULDN'T TRY TO GET THROUGH TO HIM? YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING, BUT WHEN THEY'RE TOO QUIET, YOU CAN BE SURE IT'S SOMETHING. COME IN. SORRY TO BREAK IN, DAD, BUT I'VE GOT TO CATCH THE TRAIN. JOE'S GOING TO DRIVE ME TO THE STATION. I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR AUNT ELLEN IS REALLY SICK. I THINK SHE JUST WANTS TO SEE YOU. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING IN THE CITY? NO, JUST SAY HELLO TO YOUR AUN FOR ME. SURE, DAD. BYE. KAY... HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA BE GONE? ABOUT A WEEK. I'M GONNA MISS YOU. ME TOO. TELL HUFFORD I WANT TO SEE HIM AS SOON AS HE GETS BACK, WILL YOU? ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST AS GLAD SHE'S GETTING AWAY. TAKE A LOOK, WARDEN. I'VE GOT THE GUARDS TRYING TO KEEP THEM MOVING. BUT YOU BUST UP ONE BUNCH, YOU GET ANOTHER ONE BEHIND YOUR BACK RIGHT AWAY. Ponti - 1:30. COME ON, KEEP MOVING. Guard: COME ON, BREAK IT UP. Ponti - 1:30. Ponti - 1:30. ALL RIGHT, BREAK IT UP. BREAK IT UP! Ponti - 1:30. CUT THE CONVERSATION. KEEP WORKIN'. Ponti - 1:30. OH, WE'VE GO A FEW MINUTES YET. OH, GOOD FOR US. COME ON, JOE. HERE'S A BENCH. SIT DOWN. NOT YET. MAYBE IN A FEW WEEKS. OH, THAT'S SILLY. NOT TO ME. SO, HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA BE GONE? OH, ABOUT A WEEK. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? YEAH, YOU MIGHT, UH - TELL YOU WHAT, YOU MIGHT PU AN AD IN THE NEWSPAPER FOR ME. "ONE EX-CONVICT WITH PLANS FOR THE FUTURE NEEDS A - NEEDS A GOOD JOB TO CARRY OUT THOSE PLANS." WHAT PLANS, JOE? LIKE... MAYBE SITTING DOWN WITH YOU, CALLING YOU BY YOUR FIRST NAME SOMETIME. NOBODY'S EVER STOPPED YOU FROM DOING THAT. NOBODY BUT ME. YOU SEE, I - HAVE A GOOD TIME. THANKS. HURRY HOME. THANKS AGAIN. I WILL. JOE... HMM? PEOPLE AREN'T ALL ALIKE. WHAT I MEAN IS, THE WOMAN WHO WALKED AROUND YOU THAT DAY DOWNTOWN - EVERYBODY DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN? YEAH. I HOPE I DO. COFFEE, MADAM? OH, COFFEE. WELL... NOW, THAT IT'S HERE, ALL RIGHT. I WISH YOU WOULDN'T WALK SO QUIETLY. I NEVER HEAR YOU COMING, AND I NEVER HEAR YOU GOING. YES, MADAM. ANYTHING ELSE, MADAM? NO. PONTI! PUT THOSE AWAY. YES, SIR. WHAT ARE YOU SO NERVOUS ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW. THAT ROOM YOU SLEEP IN HAS NO EXIT EXCEPT THROUGH THIS OFFICE. THERE'S NO ONE AROUND EXCEPT MY SERVANTS. YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA RISK THE EASY JOBS THEY'VE GOT? THEY'RE GONNA GET ME, WARDEN. I JUST KNOW THEY'RE GONNA GET ME. HOW? I DON'T KNOW. I WISH I DID. ISN'T THERE SOME WAY YOU CAN GET ME OUT OF HERE? I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN. YEAH? SEND HIM IN. THAT'S ALL, PONTI. YOU CAN GO. SHE GET OFF ALL RIGHT, JOE? YEAH. MISS KNOWLAND SAID THAT YOU WANTED TO SEE ME. YEAH. YEAH, I DID. I HAD TO STOP AND CHANGE CLOTHES. THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON AROUND HERE, JOE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? NO, SIR. THE MEN ARE UP TO SOMETHING. YOU SURE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS? I'M SURE. DON'T GET INVOLVED IN ANYTHING THAT WOULD RUIN YOUR CHANCES FOR PAROLE. I'M NOT INVOLVED IN ANYTHING. GOOD. I'VE BEEN THINKING OF WRITING A PERSONAL LETTER TO THAT FIRM YOU USED TO WORK FOR. I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T, SIR. MAYBE IF I EXPLAINED A FEW THINGS - IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D JUST AS SOON STAR SOMEPLACE FRESH WHERE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENED. I MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE - WHERE'S DOUGLAS? YOU STAY HERE. MORE COFFEE, MADAM? WARDEN, I - WHERE'S THE WARDEN? ALL THIS NOISE... WHAT IS IT, JOE? IT'S PROBABLY A FIGH OR SOMETHING. A FIGHT? WHY WOULD THEY BE YAMMERIN' LIKE THAT? I DON'T KNOW. JOE... YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME, PONTI. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I NEVER DID ANYTHING TO YOU. HAVE THEY GOT ME FRAMED? ARE THEY AFTER ME? I DON'T KNOW. JOE, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW SOMETHING. YOU'VE HEARD 'EM TALK. YOU'VE - IT'S GETTIN' LOUDER. MAYBE IT'S A RIOT. DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT IT IS, JOE - A RIOT? SAID I DON'T KNOW. JOE, HAVE A HEART! YOU'RE NOT LIKE THE REST OF 'EM. I WAS FRAMED INTO DOIN' WHAT I DID, AND I COULD EXPLAIN I TO EVERYBODY IF YOU'D JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE. DON'T HOLD OUT ON ME. GIVE ME A BREAK. YOU GET THIS THROUGH YOUR HEAD, PONTI - I DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. AND IF I DID, I WOULDN'T LIF A FINGER TO HELP YOU. YOU'RE IN IT WITH THEM. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE AT ME. IT'S GETTIN' WORSE. JOE, WILL YOU PLEASE GO DOWN AND FIND OUT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOU FOR ME? NO. LOOK, I DID YOU A FAVOR ONCE. SO MAYBE I DID SQUEAL ABOUT THE BREAK, BUT I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY THAT YOU WERE IN ON IT. DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE COMIN' UP FOR A PAROLE IF I'D TOLD? TWO MEN ARE DEAD BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. BUT I DIDN'T SQUEAL ON YOU. YOU OWE ME SOMETHING FOR THAT. JUST GO DOWN AND TALK TO THE GUARDS. THEY'LL KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP ME. JUST FIND OUT WHAT IT'S ABOU SO I CAN HELP MYSELF. I'D DO THAT MUCH FOR YOU. I'D DO THAT MUCH FOR A DOG. MALLOBY. GET OUT OF HERE, JOE, QUICK! PONTI. NEVER MIND. GET OUT OF HERE. COME ON, JOE. COME ON. DON'T BE A FOOL. YOU CAN'T LET THEM FIND YOU IN HERE! COME ON, JOE. COME ON! JOE! WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT, DOUGLAS? I DON'T KNOW. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST LETTING LOOSE. THEN AGAIN, THEY'LL PULL A STUNT LIKE THA TO COVER SOMETHING ELSE. COVER SOMETHING... PONTI! I'D BETTER CALL DR. AGAR. IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT. CHECK THE GUARDS DOWNSTAIRS AND SEND THE FINGERPRINT MAN UP. YES, WARDEN. YOU DIDN'T DO THIS, DID YOU, JOE? NO. WHO DID? WHO DID?! I DON'T KNOW. MARTHA? YEAH? SEE ANYBODY GO THROUGH THIS DOOR? NO. HOW LONG YOU BEEN SITTING THERE? ABOUT 40 MINUTES. WHO DID IT, HUFFORD? I DON'T KNOW. THE GUARDS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE STEPPED ACROSS THE CORRIDOR WHEN THE YAMMERING STARTED. HAVE EVERYBODY WHO WAS IN THE BUILDING CHECKED FOR FINGERPRINTS AND BLOODSTAINS. YES, WARDEN. YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH IT, JOE. YOU WERE IN THE ROOM WHEN PONTI WAS KILLED. WELL, I WASN'T - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? NOTHING. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL THEM AT THE INQUEST? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, INQUEST? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY TO THEM, HUFFORD? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY TO THE CORONER'S JURY? NOTHING. THAT'S GONNA SOUND GREAT. YOU TELL THEM NOTHING, THEY'LL PIN THIS ON YOU SO FAS YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT YOU. PIN IT ON ME? WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA DO? YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE IN THE ROOM WITH THE MURDERED MAN. THIS IS GONNA BE A CORONER'S JURY. IT'S OUT OF MY JURISDICTION. I'LL BE A WITNESS. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO IT, JOE, BUT THAT WON'T PROVE IT TO THEM! YOU KNOW I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING OF THE KIND! ALL I KNOW IS YOU'RE IN A NET. NOW, EITHER TELL ME WHO DID I OR GET READY FOR THE GAS CHAMBER YOURSELF. I CAN'T. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? YOU'RE TRADING AWAY YOUR LIFE TO LIVE BY A CODE THAT WAS SET UP BY THIEVES AND MURDERERS. IT'S THE ONLY ONE YOU'VE GIVEN ME A CHANCE TO HAVE. WHAT YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE IS THE ONLY FRIENDS I'VE GO ARE THE GUYS IN HERE. JOE, THAT'S ALL CHANGED NOW. YOU GET YOUR PAROLE NEXT WEEK. ARE YOU GONNA THROW EVERYTHING AWAY? ARE YOU GONNA PUNISH YOURSELF FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE JUST BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF BAD BREAKS? YOU GOT A CHANCE TO LIVE AGAIN. YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT? JOE, LISTEN TO ME - WILL YOU QUIT POUNDING AT ME?! I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING. I'M GONNA KEEP POUNDING TILL I GET SOME SENSE INTO YOUR HEAD! NOW, TELL ME - WHO KILLED PONTI?! ALL RIGHT. JUST TELL ME WHICH DOOR HE CAME IN. THAT FILING ROOM IN THERE IS A DEAD END, SO HE MUST'VE COME THROUGH THAT ONE OR THAT ONE. COME ON, HUFFORD, AT LEAS YOU CAN TELL ME THAT MUCH! I THOUGHT YOU WERE READY TO GET OUT OF HERE, JOE, READY TO TAKE YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING - YOU'RE NOT READY FOR ANYTHING IF YOU MAINTAIN VALUES THAT LET YOU PROTECT A... A CRUMMY MURDERER! I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE. DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON IT. WHO KILLED PONTI?! IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO STAND THERE AND TELL SOMEBODY ELSE WHAT TO DO. NO, IT ISN'T. IT'S A LOT EASIER THAN WHA YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO. WHAT KIND OF VALUES DO YOU THINK I HAVE NOW? THE RIGHT ONES. HOW DO I KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT?! YOU'VE TAKEN AWAY MY FREEDOM, MY CITIZENSHIP. THE ONLY THING YOU'VE LEFT ME IS A CERTAIN SENSE OF LOYALTY TO THOSE GUYS DOWN THERE I'VE HAD TO LIVE WITH. AND NOW YOU WANT THAT, TOO. IN THERE. YOU FIND ANYTHING? NOT YET. WHAT DOES HE SAY? NOTHING. WE'LL TAKE THA OUT OF HIM. I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU, JOE? THAT'S SOLITARY AGAIN. YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT, HAVE YOU? NO, I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN. A BUCKET MEAL EVERY SEVEN DAYS AND BREAD AND WATER IN BETWEEN. NO LIGHTS. NOBODY TO TALK TO. COME ON, JOE, USE SOME SENSE! WHO KILLED THAT MAN? ALL RIGHT, DOUGLAS, LOCK HIM UP. HE WON'T BE SO STUBBORN IN A WEEK. I WANT EVERYTHING UP HERE FINGERPRINTED - THE BRIDGE, THE CORRIDOR, THE STAIRS, THE BODY IN THERE - DON'T MISS A BIT! YES, SIR. GET ME THE CORONER. I DON'T WANT TO THROW MY WEIGHT AROUND, MR. KNOWLAND, BUT AFTER ALL, I AM STATE'S ATTORNEY FOR THIS DISTRICT. CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S UP TO ME TO GET SOME ACTION ON THINGS LIKE THIS, AND SO FAR, WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY. MR. OWENS, YOU JUST WARM YOUR CHAIR FOR A FEW DAYS AND AMUSE YOURSELF BY TALKING TO NEWSPAPERMEN. MR. KNOWLAND, THERE'S BEEN A MURDER COMMITTED, NOT ONLY IN YOUR OFFICE, BUT RIGHT IN MY DISTRICT. WELL, THAT'S LIFE FOR YOU. THIS KILLING HAPPENED OVER A WEEK AGO. SO FAR, THERE'S BEEN NO INQUEST. OUR CORONER'S DONE HIS DUTY. HE'S BEEN OUT HERE THREE TIMES. WE'VE SWORN IN A JURY, BROUGHT THEM OUT HERE IN A BUS, AND HAD TO TAKE THEM BACK EACH TIME YOU'VE ASKED FOR A POSTPONEMENT. YOU WON'T EVEN LET US SEE THIS FELLOW HUFFORD. THAT'S RIGHT. I WON'T. A MAN IS DEAD, WARDEN, AND SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY. I'M PERFECTLY AWARE OF THAT. OF COURSE. NOW, I'VE COME OUT HERE IN A FRANK AND FRIENDLY SPIRIT. I'VE LAID MY CARDS ON THE TABLE. I WANT YOU TO DO THE SAME. I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO DO THAT. ALL RIGHT, THEN. I DON'T WANT ANY MORE DELAYS. THERE'S BEEN A MURDER. THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INQUEST, A TRIAL, AND A PENALTY - THAT'S THE LAW IN THIS STATE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THA OR NOT, MR KNOWLAND. I KNOW IT, MR. OWENS. OR SHOULD I CALL YOU "JUNIOR"? I LEARNED THIS BUSINESS WHILE YOU WERE PLAYING HOPSCOTCH. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE YOUR MOTIVES? MOTIVES?! I'M TRYING TO CLEAR THIS UP, AND I DON'T WANT FUMBLING SCHOOLBOYS LIKE YOURSELF COMING IN TO MESS IT UP! NOW, YOU AND YOUR CORONER'S JURY LAY OFF OF ME, AND I'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING IN MY OWN WAY. I'M GOING TO HAVE AN INQUEST HERE TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00. I'M HAVING YOU CALLED ON A SUBPOENA, MR. KNOWLAND, AND YOU'RE GOING TO TESTIFY. I GUESS YOU CAN DO THA IF YOU WANT TO. I WANT TO. SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING AT 10:00, MR. KNOWLAND. JUNIOR. HELLO, JOE. COME ON, GET UP. YOU KNOW, JOE... YOU DON'T BELONG IN A PLACE LIKE THIS. EVERYTHING COULD BE SO EASY FOR YOU. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO STAY DOWN HERE. WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO STAY AT ALL. THERE'S A PAROLE UP THERE JUST WAITIN' FOR YOU. YOU COULD BE OUT OF HERE. WHY DO YOU WANT TO KICK YOURSELF AROUND? GIVE ME THE OTHER CANDY BAR, WILL YOU, BURKE? WELL, YOU ONLY BROUGHT ONE WITH YOU, CAPTAIN. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME, BURKE? YOU KNEW WE BROUGHT THAT DOWN FOR JOE. CAN YOU GET OUT OF HERE? Man: TELL HIM, KID. ALL RIGHT, LET'S CUT IT OUT. WHO KILLED PONTI? COME ON, OUT WITH IT - WHO KILLED HIM? I SAID WHO KILLED HIM! COME ON! GET OUT OF HERE AND LEAVE ME ALONE! Man: TELL HIM, JOE. THAT'S THE STUFF. Douglas: LOCK HIM IN. PAILS FOR SOLITARY. ALL RIGHT, BLACKIE. HI, NICK! HI. WHO EATS TODAY? HUFFORD. HAS HE BEEN DOWN THERE A WEEK? SURE HE HAS, WITH DOUGLAS AT HIM EVERY MINUTE. CAPTAIN DOUGLAS TO YOU. THIS STUFF TASTES TERRIBLE. IT NEEDS SALT. SALT. HERE. HURRY UP. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. COME ON, LET'S GET GOING. ALL RIGHT. HUFFORD. CELL NUMBER 3. KAY! HELLO, DAD. WELCOME HOME. HOW'S YOUR AUNT ELLEN? CONVINCED WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE MURDERED IN OUR BEDS. LET'S HAVE SOME LUNCH. MALLOBY! HE JUST WENT DOWN TO THE MAIN KITCHEN. WHO WAS THA WHO MET ME AT THE STATION? A NEW TRUSTY. WHERE'S JOE? WELL, THAT'S A LONG STORY. I SUPPOSE YOU READ IN THE PAPERS THAT PONTI WAS MURDERED. YES. JOE'S A MATERIAL WITNESS. HE WAS IN MY OFFICE WHEN IT HAPPENED. YOU DON'T THINK HE DID IT? I KNOW HE DIDN'T, BUT HE KNOWS WHO DID. WHERE IS HE? IN SOLITARY. SOLITARY? FOR WHAT? I'VE GOT TO FIND OU WHO DID THIS. HE KNOWS AND WON'T TALK. YOU'VE PUT HIM BACK IN SOLITARY AGAIN. THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU, KAY. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS. I'VE GOT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS RIGHT AWAY. IF I DON'T, THEY'LL BUST ME WIDE OPEN. YOU THINK YOU CAN TORTURE HIM INTO TALKING? THIS ISN'T TORTURE. WELL, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, GENTLE PERSUASION? THIS ISN'T OUTSIDE, DAD, WHERE'D YOU'D HAVE TO CHARGE HIM OR LET HIM GO. HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY HERE OR ANY RIGHTS. HE CAN TELL ME WHAT HE KNOWS AND PICK UP A PAROLE THAT'S ON MY DESK. YOU DON'T CALL THAT TORTURE? AND SUPPOSING HE DID TALK. YOU YOURSELF HATED PONTI FOR WHAT HE DID. THIS IS DIFFERENT. HOW? KEEP OUT OF THIS - I WON'T KEEP OUT OF IT, BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU DO A ROTTEN THING LIKE THIS BEFORE! YOU SET HIM UP WHEN YOU DIDN'T THINK HE DESERVED IT. YOU HAD TO DO THAT. BUT NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN HIM INTO THE WORST SORT OF MAN JUST TO SAVE YOUR OWN FACE. THAT'S NOT A VERY NICE WAY OF PUTTING IT. I KNOW IT... BUT THAT'S WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO. YOU MUST THINK A LOT OF HIM TO TALK TO ME LIKE THIS. I DO. YEAH, YOU MUST THINK AN AWFUL LOT OF HIM. GO AHEAD AND UNPACK YOUR BAGS. EVERYTHING WILL WORK OU ALL RIGHT. DAD... ...HE NEEDS SOMEBODY ON HIS SIDE. HE'S GOT YOU, HASN'T HE? AND YOU'VE ALWAYS PACKED A LOT OF WEIGHT AROUND HERE. I'VE GOT TO PICK UP SOME MORE MEAT FOR LUNCH. THE WARDEN'S DAUGHTER JUST CAME IN. NICK? YEAH? GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS. OKAY. LET'S HAVE A COUPLE OF MORE CHOPS. I planted a knife in Hufford's pail. That's great. He'll either kill himself or Douglas. I'm hopin' it's Douglas. I ought to knock some sense into your head. I thought I was doing him a favor. Give me your gun. No! I'm saving that for the break. Give it to me. Psst! ...SO THAT'S WHAT I TOLD THE DUCHESS. HURRY HIM UP, MALLOBY. YEAH, HURRY IT UP, NICK. Okay. Keep the other guys out of it. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I NEVER LIKED YOU. ARE YOU KIDDIN'? YEAH, I'M KIDDIN'. DOUGLAS WILL LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT THIS. LET'S TAKE HIM TO SOLITARY. GET BACK TO IT! OPEN UP HUFFORD'S CELL. YES, SIR. SO, YOU DON'T LIKE ME, HUH? WELL, WHAT DID HE DO? HE SLUGGED ME, CAPTAIN. I WAS JUST STANDIN' THERE THINKIN' ABOUT MY DAY OFF, WHEN HE WALKED UP AND SLUGGED ME. YOU... CRACKING UNDER THE STRAIN? WHEN I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE, I ALWAYS DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE'LL SEE HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU GET HUNGRY. PUT HIM IN HUFFORD'S CELL. COME ON. YOU'RE GOING OUT. COME ON, GET UP! TROUBLE IN SOLITARY. TELL THE WARDEN. YES? I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN. COME ON OUT, MALLOBY! I'M WAITIN' FOR YOU TO COME AND GET ME! YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE, MALLOBY. WHO IS IT? MALLOBY. WHAT HAPPENED? WE WERE BRINGING HUFFORD OU WHEN THEY BROUGHT MALLOBY DOWN FOR SLUGGING A GUARD. OPEN THE GATE. LOOK OUT! HE'S GOT A GUN. GIVE HIM ANOTHER TREATMENT. HOLD IT! MALLOBY, THIS IS THE WARDEN. HIYA, WARDEN! COME ON OUT, MALLOBY, BEFORE WE THROW TEAR GAS IN THERE. I'D LIKE TO COME OUT, WARDEN. I REALLY WOULD. ALL RIGHT. THROW YOUR GUN OUT FIRST. THEN COME OU WITH YOUR HANDS UP. AND GET SHOT AS SOON AS I HI THE OPEN? COME ON OUT, MALLOBY. YOU WON'T GET SHOT. YOU'VE GOT MY WORD ON THAT. ALL RIGHT. HERE I COME. YOU NEVER SEEM TO WIN, DO YOU, MALLOBY? YOU'VE GOT TO WIN SOMETIMES, DOUGLAS. FEEL THE KNIFE? THIS ISN'T GONNA DO YOU ANY GOOD! TELL HIM, DOUGLAS. TELL HIM HOW ONE GLASS OF BEER CAN ADD UP TO 12 YEARS. TELL HIM THE REASON I'M GONNA KILL YOU AND WHY I WAITED FOR THREE YEARS FOR THE CHANCE TO DO IT. JUST FOR THE RECORD, WARDEN, I GOT PONTI, TOO. I GUESS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND NOW WHY I COULDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING. I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU DID, BUT I SUPPOSE - HELLO. OH, HELLO, MACKAY. YEAH, YOU CAN TELL JUNIOR HE CAN HAVE HIS INQUES TOMORROW, AND THAT WAY WE CAN ALL WASTE A LOT OF TIME. WHY? 'CAUSE I ALREADY CAUGH THE MURDERER, THAT'S WHY. OH, I'M GONNA WORRY AN AWFUL LO ABOUT BEING UNORTHODOX. GO AHEAD AND TELL THE GOVERNOR HE CAN SEND HIS INVESTIGATORS OVER. HALF OF 'EM BELONG IN HERE ANYWAY. WHO? WHAT ABOUT HIM? HE GOT HIS PAROLE THREE HOURS AGO. SURE, I SIGNED IT, AND SO DID YOU! MAC, IF YOU TRY ANYTHING LIKE THAT, I'LL GO BACK INTO PRIVATE PRACTICE. I'LL NOT ONLY MAKE THAT PAROLE STICK, I'LL - LOOK, MY RESIGNATION IS SIGNED AND RIGHT HERE ON MY DESK. IF MITCHELL OR ANYBODY ELSE ISN'T SATISFIED, ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS COME OVER AND PICK IT UP! NO, NO, I'M NOT SORE! I JUST LOVE THIS JOB! YOU LEFT HERE THREE HOURS AGO. I'M A LITTLE BEHIND SCHEDULE. YOU BETTER GET STARTED. I'LL DRIVE YOU TO THE TRAIN. WHEN I START TO EARN A LIVING AGAIN, YOU WON'T MIND IF I WRITE YOUR DAUGHTER, WILL YOU? KAY, GET YOUR COAT AND MEET ME AT THE CAR. BE SURE AND GE HER FORWARDING ADDRESS. WE MAY ALL BE SPRUNG FROM THIS PLACE ABOUT THE SAME TIME.
