Can you fight it? Can you run away from it? Examples of conjoined twins. Craniopagus parasiticus Two heads with one body. Craniopagus Two bodies joined in the head. P)/Qopagus joined in the circular region or pelvis. Parasitic twins Sometimes, one twin is smaller. Less formed. The other becomes dependent on the larger twin for survival. And lastly, Rachi pag us Joined back to back. Twins often share a liver, - digestive system and other organs. - Hey. - Are you okay? - It's one of the most common cases - Yeah. - of conjoined twins. Just like our patient today. The probability of giving birth to conjoined twins is something like, one in every two hundred thousand! They're pitiful, sir. They look like circus freaks. Survival rates is very low. Usually, they're stillborn. But if they come out alive, they don't usually last long. So sir, do we separate them? If yes, can we save them both? It's like we're putting both their lives in danger. If we do separate them and they do survive, their life would be hard. Again, it's an ethical question! Who decides who lives and who dies. Well, I think we should save the healthy one and let go of the weak. Just like mercy killing. Nothing wrong with that. Your opinions never fail to amaze me, Ms. Castro. My bro let me drive this car. I told him we have a special date. For you. My boyfriend's so sweet! HaPPy anniversary! Happy anniversary too! So... let's go? Let's go. Where do we stay? Pao... We're on our first year now, right? Pao, please. Wait. We can't do this. I don't want to. My, please. Give it to me. No. Pao! Pao! Please! What the?! Pao! Come on! You know what? I don't understand you! I thought you love me! And I thought you're liberated! Why are you so conservative when it comes to us? I love you! Why can't you give me what I want?! Pao! Pao, wait! Pao, will you just wait! Come on, Pao! Go home by yourself! Paging Dr. Santos. Hi, Mylene. I have a surprise for you later. I'm sure you'll like it. Mylene! Mylene Castro! How's your outstanding balance? Among all the graduating batch, you're the only one who haven't paid in full. I have a promissory note. I can't take promissory notes this time. I'm sorry. You have to pay in full before the final exams. Otherwise, you can't take the exams. And you're running for honors, right? Okay. Here. Thank you. How much is this? Papa's here to take care of you at all times. Because I love you. Eat well, okay? This is your favorite. There. There. There. There you go. Eat a lot. J3)/jay?! Jayiay! Did you climb up again?! Jayjay! What are you doing at Mylene's room?! She'll get mad! Damn it! Mr. Nanding. About the rent... I might not be able to pay for it. Everyone here seems out of their minds. There's no one decent to talk to whenever you're not around. That's the way he is, Vangie. He has Alzheimer's disease that's why sometimes he seems crazy or out of his mind. But sometimes he goes back to being normal so just bear with it. What about Mrs. Arevalo? You can talk to her. There's no difference! She acts like she owns this house! But we're all just boarders here! My child said, you're afraid to face the truth. Now you're mocking me, old man?! She told me everything. What do you mean? - Who?! - Vangie! Just relax. Don't fight with him. You might be forgetting, he's still our landlord. Anyway, if you need anything, here, it's Mr. Nanding's medicine. Mr. Nanding, you told me to buy you this. What is this for'? For bopis? Sir! I've been wailing for you! Come. Where's Jayjay? They're here. Coming! - Mylene! Mylene! - Coming! Hey, thanks. I forgot my keys. You again? My, I let Pao join us on our group study. Is that okay? I'm sorry. Let's go, Pao. Hey! Are you okay? You look like you've seen a ghost! I think I saw a kid under the car. Jayiay? Where? My, we're having a group study, not a party. Are you cooking? Jo. Jo. Who was that I saw earlier? That? Sometimes, I see him too. But don't worry. He's just friendly. You see him? There you go again. Things that haunt us are none other than the traumas and bad memories that happened to us. Guilty complex brought by our conscience. Those are the things that haunt and disturb us. So that so called ghost is just in our mind. This is different, My. You would feel it if you keep an open mind. But you do not! Because you have such thick armor! You're not open that's why you're also not receptive. Stop it. You'll become a doctor and yet, you believe in hocus pocus stuff! Be ashamed of Hippocrates and to the world of Science. Whatever! Suit yourself! You're really insensitive! Joanna. Do you talk to them? Sometimes. You're a psychic? Can you do it? Let's try. Oh well, I'll finish what I'm cooking. Let's try it, Jo. Come on. Please, Jo. Someone's responding. I can see something! I can see him! His voice... It's like... It's like from a kid's voice but... But no. He died long ago. He lived here. He's here now. Little boy, talk to us. Talk to us! What are you doing? Let me join! He was young when he died. But that was a long time ago. He was supposed to be old now. Wait! What's this?! There's another one! There's another one who wants to show up! - Tell her, Joanna. - Joanna! Joanna, what is it?! Are you okay? - I see a woman! - The kid?! No! There's a woman who was murdered! She was choked! She was murdered! I can't do this anymore! I can't do this! - Vangie. - Vangie, you're boss. Vangie! - Sir. - Did you already feed the kid? Coming, sir. Irritating nanny! That's it?! Joanna! Let's do it again! Let's continue! - Hurry because - - Maybe next time. I can't handle it. That was short. Damn it! So how's the spiritualist slash doctor of medicine? I swear I saw a woman who was being murdered! She suddenly interrupted like... a cable interference. Interference? From this boarding house or another channel? At first, I can only sense the kid. And then... I don't understand. She wasn't supposed to be here! She can't She's not from here. She's not from here so I guess she's from Alabang? Iloilo? or Davao? Davao? How did you say Davao? Nothing! What?! I'll go with you. - It's too late, my child. - Do you still have a room for rent available? Come in. Come in. Come in. Miss, let's play. Miss... Miss... Miss, let's play. Miss! Miss... - Miss... - Little boy? She's... She's... She's Alicia. She's going to live her. Hi, Alicia. Mylene, take her to her room. - Okay. - Take her upstairs. She has high fever! This is what you get if you walk outside in this kind of weather. Jo, put a blanket on her. I can look over her tomorrow. Besides, I only have one subject in the afternoon. Are you sure? Yes. By tomorrow, her fever should already subside. If not, we have to take her to the E.R. Will you both be okay here tonight? Sorry, I can't stay. That's okay. We don't need you anyway. Thank you. This is embarrassing. You have an infection. Don't worry. We're med students. That's why we're used to taking care of sick people. You're a doctor'? Alicia... You're pregnant. Please help me. I can't do this. I'm scared! I need your help! I have money! I can pay you! Please, miss. Help me! Please help me. You have to help me. My baby. Baby... MY baby... Where's my baby? Hello? Ma! You startled me! It's a miracle! Good thing you're here! It's almost one year since you last visited. Ma, I need money. For my tuition fee. I also haven't paid for two months for the boarding house. You know you can stay here, Mylene. The house is big. But you don't want to. I don't have anyone with me here. You don't even care about my feelings. Ma. You and your dad are the same. You choose to stay away from me. Everything... He blames it to me. Dad didn't stay away. He died. You're so beautiful, my child! I know you'll grow up to be beautiful when you were a child! That's why, you're the one I chose. I did everything to keep you safe. I did everything even if it hurts. Although, I'm having doubts with my decisions. I did all of that for your wellbeing. There you go! You're not alone anymore! We're not alone anymore! You know what? I always think of your sister. I hope she'll come to me. I even write her letters. And I also talk to her. I told her... Don't be mad at me, my child. " I'm just waiting for her to answer back. - Ma. - My child! My child, don't go just yet! Stay with me first. Ma... You know why I don't want to stay here? Why I can't concentrate with my studies here? Ma, I need money! - I have to graduate! - I just miss you! My child! What's the matter with you?! What are you doing?! Pao, why are you here? I've been following you. Can we talk? It's been six months and I think it's time for us to move on. It's been six months and I think it's time for us to move on. I think we should just be friends. My, forgive me. How many times should I ask for your forgiveness? It's not you. I'm not ready to be in a relationship yet. Because? I don't feel complete. I don't feel like I'm enough. I don't think I can give myself to anyone if I'm still not satisfied with myself. This is my fault. I only did that to hurt you. I only did that because you don't want me into your life. Because you don't want anything to happen between us. So I did it with someone else but it doesn't mean a thing. I swear! I don't love her. My, you're the only one I love. You're enough. My, you lack nothing. Pao. Let's stop this. I don't want to talk about it. I'm going home. My! What's happening to you?! Is it because your mom's comparing you to your sister?! What? I heard you earlier. SOl'I'Y- My, I didn't even know you have a sister. You don't know anything about me! My, sorry. I'm just concerned. You're concerned? Pao, will you please stop bothering me?! And even though, you always hang out with my best friend, you won't get nothing! Stop bothering me! My! Mylene! If your child is crying, make it stop! Mr. Nanding? Who is il? Who are you talking about? Mr. Nanding, you look sick. You should rest. This is the first time he's gotten mad like this! Someone among you did something terrible! And he won't ever forgive! You shouldn't have done that! You shouldn't have done that! You shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't have done that! There's nothing else we could do. There you go. There. Jyiay, what is it?! Jayiay! What is it?! What's the matter?! Mr. Nanding! Mr. Nanding! Vangie! Mr. Nanding... Vangie! Mr. Nanding's son is coming over. Dr. Ramirez called him. Mr. Nanding has a son? How did you know? What I know is all his relatives are in the U.S. He didn't say anything about it. Well... We cannot inform other people all our personal stuff. That's why it's even called personal. My son wasjust like that when we was that age. He has an imaginary friend. You have a son? How old is he? Like I said, it's personal. Mr. Nanding's son might arrive tonight. I told you! She's always not in the mood to talk with anybody. Little boy? Joanna? This is the first time I tried to look at these. Probably, that's Mr. Nanding's only child. And that's his wife. What about it? It's because Nothing. - Nothing. - Hello. I'm sorry. Angelo. Gelo's for short. Our dog gave birth. So I thought if I give him one, it would probably cheer him up. I haven't seen him in thirty years. You know. Break the ice. I don't know what to say to him. So how long have you been here in Manila? About two years. My wife has a business here. So I came back from the States. We're based in Batangas with my kids. Your dad knows about it? He knows. I called him twice. A number of times. Just to pay my respects. You know. Broken homes. I'm sure Mr. Nanding loves you, Angelo. When my mom and I left for the States, we no longer had a contact with him. My stepdad and I are very close. So I treated him like a real father. So Dr. Ramirez called me up. He said, these are the things I should do. Obligations. Hope people will understand. Your dad's awake now. Mr. Nanding? You have a visitor. Pa... Do you still remember me? It's Gelo, your son. The plants should be taken care! My son hasn't eaten yet! Pa, look. I brought you a puppy. He will cheer you up. He's fine now. But no one's taking care of him here. I'll just take him to the hospital. Mom's going to get mad. She doesn't want me to help him. You're right. It would belong to me. And it's worth a lot, huh. This is a prime real estate. I'll talk to my friend who's an agent. Maybe he could sell this in a large amount. That's for sure! He will sell this. Of course. This will be sold right away. This one has a potential. Are you ready? Just be careful. Wait for me. - Take it easy. - Mr. Nanding, let's go. Can you do it? Slowly. There you go. Get in. We'll go now. Okay. Just a minute. Sorry. I didn't know the dog has taken parvo. I should've taken him to the vet before taking him here. I'm sorry for that. Anyway, I'll have dad confined first. Maybe that'll be the best for him. I don't want him to be a burden to all of you. You guys have to study, right? Are you sure? Yes. There are specialists to cases same as what dad has. I'll be dropping by once in a while. For repaint and repair. Look. The house looks beautiful in these photos. What year did you leave the country? My parents separated 1981. What about your brothen'? My brother'? How did he die? Joanna. I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about. When you left for U.S., how old were you then? He was six years old when he died, right? Here. Look at these pictures on the wall. That's him. Six years old? Died? What do you mean? Joanna, I'm sorry. That's me. That's my sixth birthday. Those are my last pictures taken here. That's my party. After that, dad and I were no longer able to talk. Brother'? Maybe a half brother? But I never saw him. Gelo, you don't have to. It's aln'ght. Mom discovered that dad had a child with the maid. Mom can't take it. And she doesn't want to tell the details. And your brother? I don't know. I don't know what happened to him. I don't know what he looks like. It was thirty years ago. Why do you want to know? Why do you think I wasn't the one in the picture? Has dad told you a story? Jayiay! Jayjay, what are you doing here?! Where did you get this? What happened here? Jayiay! J3)/lay, Why are you in my room?! Jayiay! Javier! Javier?! My child! My child! I waited for you for so long! I'm so happy you came back! Don't ever leave me again. Javier? Javier. Please talk to mommy. I feel lonely there. Come with me, ma. We will never be apart again. Never again. You kid! You're just here?! I promise. I promise I will be there, my child. I promise. Javier. Mylene! Javier! Javier. My... Is itjust me or this place just gets weirder and weirdel'? Maybe Mrs. Arevalo's just drunk. She said she saw her son. I can also see some others. Me too. But he's a kid. How about you, My? I've been having nightmares. It's getting often but... that's nothing. I can see them before but... But this time it's different. I feel different. Good thing you came home early. You're always traveling. The area that I'm detailing is now bigger. How's Tarlac? Still the same. A lot of things have been happening since you left. Mr. Nanding almost had a stroke. - And Ms. Stingy - - Fine. Fine. I'm tired. Why do you always bury yourself with work? That's the only thing I know! Sir, I'm here. Fine. Put Jayjay to his bed. Sir. - Sir... - Whal?! Jayiay! Jayjay, you might wake them up! Come here! Jayiay! I said come here! Let's go to sleep! Your dad might wake up! He'll get mad at you! Who are you playing with?! My playmate said she knows your secret aunt Vangie. You killed my mommy! N  - Come with me, Vangie. Sis! Come with me! Just tell Mr. Nanding when he comes back. Will you be okay? Where will you and Jayjay go? I'll leave him with my in-laws in the province. I don't even know how will I explain it to them. She's their second daughter to die. What do you mean? My wife died last year. They said she didn't wake up from her nightmare. - You mean Vangie's related with - - Yes, they're sisters. Vangie's Jayjay auntie. I thought she's his nanny. No. She's Jayjay's auntie. His mommy and Vangie are sisters. She came with me to take care of Jayjay. Oh, my God. Let's go, Jayiay- Say bye to your friends. I'll go ahead, ma'am! We'll go now. We might get late to our ight. To Davao? To Davao, right? You guessed it right! The parents tried to make sure everything should be done to separate the two. Of course! They want to save both. This will be the first time, if ever, in the history of this hospital. Unfortunately, our findings show there are several vital organs that they share. So, there's a big chance of death among the two of them, if we push through with this procedure. We will keep you updated of their status. - Sir... - Yes? Excuse me. Here. - Two copies each? - Yes. Oh. Oh sorry, miss. MY, are you okay? I've been following you. - Why were you following me? - I followed you because you don't look okay earlier. You didn't go back to class. - Give me that! - These are your old photos! Why do you have two copies each? - What?! - My, what's that?! - Why do you have that scar?! - Just - Just live me alone! Have you met Mylene's sister? Pao, Mylene is the only child. No, Jo. I heard it. She and her mom had a fight. I need money! I have to graduate! My child... stay here for a while. You know why I don't want here? Because I don't want to be like you! You're crazy. So if you don't have money, I'd rather go now. You're always so harsh! It seems like money is the only thing you want from me! You're a heartless daughter! I did everything for you but I can't feel even a slightest compassion from you! Your sistefs probably better! Besides, she really was the only one who had a heart! And you don't! You're the prey one! You only have beauty but you don't have heart! You're the reason why she's not here with us anymore! Do you think her sister ran away? She never told me about her sister. Can you ask her? Okay. L'll try. Pao, will you transfer to our boarding house? We don't have a male boarder with us. That's not a problem to me. But you know your friend well. That's fine! Come on! I'll call Gelo now, okay? Jo, what caused Mylene's scar? What scar? I know that guy. Just a minute! Hey, Jonas. Come in, Paolo. This is for Mylene. I'll give it to her. What happened here? - How did this happen? - Maybe it wasn't sprinkled with water. Hey, MY- It's you. I thought it was someone else. My, have Jo told you that I'll be staying from now on? So you have a guy around? If that's okay with you? Because if it's not okay with you then I can go back to my old boarding house. My. Are you okay? Will you come with me wherever I go? Yes, My. Wherever you go. I promise. My... Are you sure about this? Javier? Javier! My son! Javier! Javier! Javier. Javier. Good thing, you came back. I thought you already left your mama! Javier, your mama loves you so much! You're back to smoking? I thought you already quit for good? Stress. Who's not stressed over Medicine? Come on! You and your excuses! Answer me, my son! It's a cold place where I am now. Lonesome. I missed you so much, my son! - I missed you so much! - Come with me. L'll come with - Javier! Javier! Javier! By the way, Pao already transferred here. He texted earlier. Javier! - Javier! - I'll just check on Paolo. Okay, Jo. I'll just finish this. Paolo?! Paolo?! Paolo! Paolo?! Pao! Paolo! Pao! - Jo. What? - Pao. Are you okay? Javier! Pao, I swear. Mylene was with me. We came back from duty. What was that? Was Ijust dreaming, Jo? My God! What happened?! I was smoking and then she suddenly - Why did Mrs. Arevalo jumped?! What are we going to do now?! That's why there's a lot of mysteries going on that boarding house. Don't you get goosebumps? Mylene, something happened that's why Vangie and Mrs. Arevalo died. And Mr. Nanding... I think Mr. Nanding knows something about this. A kid took Gelo's form. But is he the one who kills? Mylene - Mylene! Mylene, you're not listening! Oh come on. What's the matter with you?! Why are you so insensitive?! Is something bothering you? Bothering? As a matter of fact, all my life, something's bothering me. You have no idea. Mr. LOpeZ! Keep that. There will be no picture taking in class! And I hope you remember your ethics. No posting of patients' pictures on Facebook. - I will have you expelled! - Sorry, sir. I won't do it again. Okay, class... Look closely at Mary and Rose. I believe this is your first time to see them in person. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. As you can see, Rose's growth is smaller and abnormal compared to Mary. MYlehe! My! Sir. What happened? Relax yourself, Mylene. You know why they let me handle this case of the siamese twins? Because although this is the first case of the hospital, twenty plus years ago, I underwent this kind of case. And it was a success. At least if you look at it from one angle. Do you follow what I'm saying? When I saw you enrolled for Medicine, I felt so proud. My guilty feelings were gone. It was a success! Your mom. Us. We made the right decision. We gave you a better life. What do you mean? You still don't get it, do you? I was your doctor when you were born. Both of you. Your body was better formed than your sistefs. But... your own heart was too small. We gave you her heart. We did good. I'm happy you turned out the way you did, Mylene. You were right when you said, we should always save the healthy and let go of the weak. - Ma'am, here's your cake. - Ma'am. Why? I can't find a Filipino word for it. But it says, in German, it's called dPPelganger. This could be the thing we're seeing at the house. It says, doppelgangers are lost souls. They're the ones who don't have forms so they try to take others'. Even the living ones. Hello, ma? I'm here at the old house. Just a minute. Just a minute. Bro, will you get the things then put it here. - Okay. - Hello, ma? No, I should have this fixed. So it'll look more attractive to the buyers. That's not it, ma. After everything that happened? I don't think I want to hold on to this property anymore. Bro, just put the other stuff here. Ma, just a minute. I'll call you back. Bro, come on! I told you to put the things here. Where is it, huh?! What the?! Are you imitating what I'm doing?! Oh, come on! Pa? You're supposed to be at the hospital! What are you doing here?! Some say, when you see a person who looks like you, it means you'll die soon. Who are you?! Why do you look like that?! Hello? Yes, it's me. Is that it? Yes. Okay. Is this what you're looking for? Let me help you. Soon, we will be together. Thank you, Joanna, for giving me this chance to talk to you. I can't go back to that house. Too many bad memories. Gelo once said that you saw someone who looked like him? Yes, ma'am. But... a younger version. And did he mention to you that he saw his dad at the house? While he knows that his dad is at the hospital all this time. I think I know who or what you've been seeing. And I can feel it has something to do with the death of your two boarders. That's why I came back. When was this baby had an operation? I think it was last Tuesday. Where's the other one?! Where's the other baby?! Why nobody announced? I don't know. Someone else was on duty. Why? The Bible said we are created in the likeness of God. God gave us our own different appearance. That appearance gives physical form to our soul. But what if there are souls that never formed because they weren't given a chance? What do you mean? What I mean is there are souls that weren't given a form because their life was out short. Where's Dr. Gonzaga? You have class, right? The operation was successful. So why did they choose Mary than Rose to live? Wait. Wait. - Who's Mary and who's Rose? - B-1 and B-2. - Huh?! - I meant the siamese twins! Poor thing. Who decided on this? You know what, you should think it's just an extra finger you cut off. It's just an appendage with eyes and mouth. - Come on. It's still a life! - She's right! - Nurse? - Yes? - Have you seen Dr. Gonzaga? - I think he's in the E.R. I'm not sure. Okay. Hello? Mr. Nanding, how are you? You look okay today! What's my name? You are Joanna Aquino. Very good! Mr. Nanding's very good! Jonas? Where's the baby? Mylene! You came to visit. I missed you. Where's the baby? What baby?! I kept a kidney for you. I don't need that! I said where's the baby?! This is cheap. Jonas! What the?! You know what I need! Where's the baby?! Baby? Wait! Do you want me to give you a baby?! Huh? How many do you want? So how are you doing at the boarding house? Mr. Nanding, that's what I've been wanting to tell you. I wanted to ask you about some personal matters. Because of what happened at the boarding house. Okay, sir. I'll let you know. Pao! Why did the police call? Jo. They said Mrs. Arevalo's ear was out off. Cut off?! Hello?! Her face was even crushed! And all her bones were broken! No, Jo. Her ear was cut with a knife. Like it was sliced. Oh, My God! By what?! By a scalpel?! That's why he's asking if we're Medical students. They were speculating that maybe someone pushed her off. Sht. Then who?! My?! Where have you been?! What happened to you?! I'm tired. The hospital called us. They said Nanding ran away. I think he will be heading here. I went to the hospital earlier. I told him the things that are happening here so that he's informed. I'm sorry. Maybe the reason why he ran away is because he's heading here. Maybe you just got here first. Maybe he's coming any time now. You don't know a lot about the things that happened in this house. It was raining that night. I was awakened when Nanding wasn't on my side. I tried to look for him. There was blood on the oor! I followed it. I saw our maid in the kitchen. She was covered with blood! Ma'am! Nanding came in from outside. Sir! Help me! HelP me! This is too much! This is too much! I told him to take our maid to the hospital. Get off! This is too much! You've always been like this! - This is too much! - We shouted at each other. I know Nanding buried something from where he dug. And he buried it here whatever it was. You have no idea how all these things have haunted me all these years. Ma'am... Ma'am. Ma'am! - Take this! - No! Who are you?! Enough! Enough! - Hey! - We know what you want! I know why you take someone else's form! Those people you took away, they don't have anything to do with this! They didn't do you wrong! We know what you need! You want someone to be with you! You want someone to play with, right?! Baby, stop. Just take me! Not them! Just take papa instead! Mr. Nanding! It's Mr. Nanding! Mr. Nanding! Just take papa instead! Take me! Oh, My God! Is that Vangie?! - It's Mrs. Arevalo! - Mr. Nanding! Nanding! Joanna. Do you know who's that baby?! No. Miss, help me! I tried to find her, Jo. I knocked on her room. But no one was answering. It's open so I went in. Do you remember when I asked you about her scar'? Mylene was right about what she said. I don't know her at all. Now, I know why she's been saying she's lacking something and she's incomplete. So I thought, what else is she hiding? Her secrets. I can't believe it. It's like she assembled another anatomy. Another body. Another human. It's like she recreated her lost twin. I guess in the end, she was able to complete it. In the end, she's finally complete. Come now. I've been waiting for you. I waited for you all your life. Do what was supposed to happen a long time ago. Myra, I don't know ifl can do it. You're the only one they saved, Mylene. You must pay for your debt. But Myra, I recreated - What?! Your collections?! You thought it's enough? Come. I'm sorry, Myra. I think I can't do it. I can't do it. You will come with me! If we can't live together, then we will die together! Forgive me but only one of us has the right to live. And that's me. Ifl must kill you over and over in my head, then I will. Because you can't mess with my mind for the rest of my life. - Goodbye. - Mylenel Forgive me. It's aln'ght. It's aln'ght. My. Let's go? Okay. I'll follow. Forgive me, my sister. I hope your soul will finally be in peace.
