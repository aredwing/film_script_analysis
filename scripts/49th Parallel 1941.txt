I've been answering that question till I'm fair sick and tired of it. Not a soul comes through this post that doesn't ask it, huskies and all. "Where's the ship, boss? Where's the ship?" - Bien, alors, where is she? - Behind the hill! Ah, oui Bien sr. Come on. Sit down. Well, what's the news from home, eh? Some good, some bad. Everyone is well. That is good. Business is slow. That is bad. My father say it is because of them war rumours. But he tell me no worry. This Hitler is only bluffing. And he said they all say there will be no war this year or next year. You look to me as I go mad. Of course, I was forgetting. You can't have seen a paper in over a year. What do you mean? - Has it happened, then? - Sure it's happened. Bigger than the last. Nom de dieu! - Who fighting? - Mostly everybody. - Who starting first? - Oh, the Germans, of course. They marched in on the Poles in September 1939. - The Poles? - Sure. Ma foi, I thought all the Poles was in Canada! No, no, Johnnie. They've given Poland a terrible time. Wiped out Warsaw. And those poor refugees you know, the women and children who tried to get away ... ... they machine-gunned them down. [French] The Germans are ordinary men, same as you and me. I wouldn't do a thing like that. Would you? Well, you can't tell me they do. That's all newspaper talk to try and bring us in. Hmpf. A wee bit late, Johnnie, my lad. We are in. Canada, in the war? Sure she is. Didn't you hear the bombing tonight? Bombing? Was that bombing? Sure. One of our planes went across. Maneuvering, I suppose. Yi-yi-yi-yi. So, Canada, she in the war. [Scoffs] Pas possible Anyhow, you can't tell me French Canada got mixed in it too. - I certainly can. - Nom de dieu! No. They're in it just the same as everybody else. But that beat me! I don't see what for French Canada had to go to defend a bunch of Poles! I don't get that at all. I don't see what that mean to us. Anyhow, one kind government ... ... much same like 'nother. Yeah, you're right there. They're all the same. Don't get you nowhere. Anyhow, we needn't worry about it out here. I guess all we got to do is just to do our jobs. [Scoffs] Hmpf. That suit me. - What about a wee drink, Johnnie, eh? - That suit me too. [Laughs] [Wind Whistling] ## [Whistling] - Well, here's the skin off your nose. - And off yours too, you old walrus. [Both Chuckling] Ay-yi-yi. I won't sleep well tonight. - Never do first night in real bed. - ## [Discordant Notes] I was just the same when I was trapping. - Oh, but you get used to it in a couple of nights. - [Dogs Whining, Barking] ## [Chords] [Barking, Whining Intensifies] Dogs are noisy tonight. [Chuckles] Seem like your and mine getting to know one 'other. ## [Melody] [Wind Continues Whistling] Aye, the wind is blowing up. ## [Accordion Continues] ## [Johnnie Singing In French] ## [Both Singing] - [Laughing] - A regular Montreal concert. - Window! Door! - Hey, what's the big idea? - Hello. - Move out. - Johnnie! - Stay where you are. - Door locked, Herr Leutnant - No one else here? - Only this. - Search him. Kranz and Lohrmann, search the other two. You've ammunition and rifles here. Where are they? They're in the cupboard. Kranz, your rifle. Do not smash cupboard. Cupboard's not locked. - Where are the rifles? - Better tell him. - In the store. - Which is the store? Big building outside with the company sign. Vogel. Kranz. What sort of crook are you anyhow? What's the game? [Lohrmann] Have you people in Canada not heard that there's a war on? [Laughing] Sure we hear there war on! Merde de cochon! You ... - German. - Yes! German! We are German! Okay. Why yell about it? Moi, j'ai compris You German. I'm Canadian, he Canadian and he Canadian. My father fight against you last time. We give you one good licking then, and we do it again. Johnnie! [Grunting] [Wind Whistling] - [Clock Chiming] - [Snoring] [Chiming Ends] Don't any of you guy ever laugh? The English tell us we've no sense of humour, which means simply ... ... that our humour is different from theirs. Ah. I tell Nick. He appreciate that. - Nick? - My servant, who your man kick ... ... when he answered back. The Eskimos are racially as low as Negroes. - What's the matter with Negroes? - They're semi-apes, only one degree above the Jews. Who says so? Those are the Fhrer's own words, from Mein Kampf Ah, voyons! I make my living trapping animal. But if I was meet half-ape, I wouldn't kick him in the stomach as you did that husky in there. Please don't abuse our kindness. We're trying to be friendly, but you're making it difficult. Okay, okay, okay. [Radio: Beeping, Frequencies Tuning] ## [Folk] Do you have to waste my batteries? - I want you to answer a few questions. - Let's hear them first. What transportation have you with the outside world? Transportation? I'll have to walk to the railway, or else wait for the boat. - When does the next boat arrive? - If the weather's good, she'll be here this July. If the ice closes, it'll be the July after that. - I want the truth. - You callin' me a liar? - Yes. - ## [Whistling] You ask me to believe that you've only one ship a year? Believe it or not, it's all the same to me, my wee man. - Where's the nearest railway? - Churchill. Churchill. - And the nearest police post? - Aha! You'll soon find out! - [Laughing] - Lake Harbour. You seem to know all about it, eh? - What strength is it? - Uh, 30 men. Or is it 25, Albert? Or two. [French] Where you get him? - How 'bout this for a map? - It makes ours look a bit out of date Where'd you get it? - Did you recall a missionary called Malotte? - Malotte! Sure! You remember him, Albert? - A flying missionary. - I mind him. You remember that time his airplane was lost and all the people pray for his safety? - He was a good missionary. - He was one grand fellow. And an even better mapmaker. Oh, so that was it. The spyin' blackguard. I would never have believed it, a man of his cloth. Oh, and good. Good priest like Malotte too. And a good German. [Radio: Beeping, Frequencies Tuning] [Radio: Man] In a report from the far north, Cape Ross reports heavy slop ice from ... [Man] Come in, C-Y-7-B. C-Y-7-B. That's our call signal. Who is it? Oh, just a friend of mine. An American from Grand Rapids, Michigan. - He plays chess with me. - Chess? - Sure, chess - Why? To pass the time! Ma foi! He don't often get such pleasant company here. Board's over there on the table by the radio. We play three nights a week. - [Hirth] But not tonight - [Beeping Continues] The first night we've missed in nearly two years. [Radio: Man] 9-A-U-E calling C-Y-7-B. C-Q-ing C-Y-7-B. Hope everything's all right. Say, what's the matter, Mac? Why don't you answer? This is Russell speaking. Try again in 15 minutes. If still missing, will report to Winnipeg. If still missing, will report to Winnipeg. Standing by. - What is he going to report? - That an accident might have happened to me. - He's got to do something about it. - Why Winnipeg? - It's the head office of our company. - What company? [Albert] The Hudson's Bay Company Hirth. [Whistles] Tell me, uh ... ... do you really march around in Berlin doing this? - Yes. - Oh. Why? - I tell you, I know what I'm talking about. - [Hirth] You always do, don't you? [Kuhnecke] We're not in the ship now. The whole position's entirely different. You seem to forget that I'm a high party member, one of the first million in 1930. You didn't even join till 1936. One of the first 70 million that's you. And I'm a practical man too. I'm not a dreamer, an idealist, like you. It's all a question of experience. I'm an engineer. I understand ships, I understand radio, I understand planes ... ... and I understand human nature. I tell you, I'm right, Hirth. They must play chess! Our position is too dangerous to allow one of these men a free hand with the radio. - Free hand? With my gun at the back of his head? - That makes no difference. Do you want that noisy American butting in and causing trouble? He's going to notify Winnipeg. They'll have heard about our submarine being bombed, and they'll put two and two together. I'm right, Hirth. They must play chess. - [Radio: Beeping] - [Radio: Russell] My move. Pawn H-2 takes G-3 Pawn H-2 takes G-3. Standing by. - [Albert] I told you not to make that move. - [Kuhnecke] I know what I'm doing. Watch me. [Albert] Why should I watch you, may I ask? The game's lost. I haven't lost a game in two years. You haven't lost this one yet, have you? - Are you ready? - Aye, I'm ready. [Switch Clicks] - Pawn B-7 to B-5. - [Switch Clicks] - [Switch Clicks] - [Russell Laughing] Say ... Why did my wife have to go to a double feature the one night I had you on the run? But you come to the wrong man. I won't guide you to the railroad, me. - You never make it anyhow. - Why not? This is one big country. But very few people. Everyone know everybody. You can't make a goose step through it without the police find out. - But no one has seen us. - [Dogs Barking, Whining] Penses tu? coute If one husky dog have the smell of you ... ... his boss know from the way he howl... ... that there is stranger in district. [Barking, Whining Continue] One Eskimo might find your track. Maybe have. Most likely that Eskimo is on his way to Mounted Police right now. Perhaps, perhaps. But you must help us. After all, it's your own interest, now that your country has surrendered. My country? Surrender? At 12:30 on the 17th of June, 1940 ... ... France laid down her arms. France? Ah! I'm Canadian! Certainly. You are a French-Canadian. But you must know that after the war, the Fhrer intends to liberate ... ... your people from the British tyranny. Comment? How? French Canada will be free. You will be free. [French] I am free! Or, I was plenty free till you guys got in. I mean the freedom of your people, an oppressed minority. The freedom to speak their own language, to have their own schools and churches ... ... to govern their own affairs. Here you will find it written in the Fhrer's own words. Perhaps you've read it. Uh, I have no room in my pack for any book. I know my Bible. That's enough for me. This is the Bible. You must get a copy. It will explain everything to you as it has to me. You better look up how to get out of Canada, then. Maybe she don't tell you that, huh? Ah! Quelle criture funny. Maybe, uh, your Fhrer ain't so smart as he think. Don't he know that we French Canadians have always our own school? And church. And the right to speak as we want. And run our own affair, by golly. No doubt you have certain privileges, but I don't feel ... Let me ask you one question. Well? How about them, uh ... Poles? How 'bout the French? Do you let them run their own affair? That is different. The whole new order in Europe ... [Laughs] Okay, okay. You said enough. Hello! Hello! Russell speaking. Say, my wife's just brought in an Extra. The whole front page is covered with news about that submarine your flyers knocked off up there. - [Woman] Tell him the headline reads "Nazi U-boat ..." - [Russell] Oh, Maude ... [Russell] ... quit yelling in my ear and give me the paper I want to read it to them. [Maude] Homer Russell, you'll do no such thing. It's my story, and I stick to it. [Russell] Oh, Maude, don't be a heel Mac'll wanna hear about it. Then take a back seat honey, and I'll read it. Hello! Hello! Is that you, Mac? This is Maude speaking. It says the submarine was sunk right in your backyard I'll read it to you. "Nazi U-boat sunk in Hudson Bay." That's the headline. "A German submarine believed to be the U-37 was destroyed in Hudson Bay ... "... near Wolstenholme by Canadian Coastal Command patrol planes ... "According to an official report ... "... the Squadron Leader claimed that several direct hits by medium bombs ... "... were scored before the Nazis could submerge. He circled the spot and found no signs of any survivors." There's a whole lot more to it, but that's the gist of it - How come you didn't know about it? - [Russell] Why didn't you tell us? - [Shouts] - [Gunshot] - Get your rifles. - Come out. - [Clattering] - [Wheezing] [Coughs] You can't leave him there like that. Dirty lot of murderers. [Hirth] Vogel, see if they've heard anything outside. - [Waves Cresting] - [Dogs Barking] [Albert] Killers That's all you are. Killers - All quiet, Herr Leutnant - Good. - Can't have heard the shot. - [Johnnie Coughing, Groaning] [Wheezing] - Johnnie? - [Coughs] Johnnie. Johnnie, my son. [Coughs] It's nearly 1:00. It'll be three, four hours before there's anybody about. If anybody should come to the post, we'll see they don't get away. Kranz, Lohrmann, get him into the other room. - What about the radio? - Dead. I wonder if that American in Michigan got anything. Idiot! - Well, that should do it, Vogel, eh? - Yes, Herr Leutnant. - But if you were to - Shut up! [Exhales] - [Vogel] Hear anything, Herr Leutnant? - [Kuhnecke] Shut up, can't you? [Johnnie Coughs] [Kuhnecke] I've got it! Wake him up! Quickly! - Herr Leutnant! - Jahner. - What is it? - [Kuhnecke] Come on here! Winnipeg Hudson's Bay Company. They're sending a plane. - What kind of a plane? - An emergency plane from Churchill! It'll be here in three hours. There's a police boat coming too, from Lake Harbour. - Johnnie. - [Kuhnecke] We've got to get out quickly. [Hirth] Unless we can get hold of that plane they're sending. The company's sending a plane. - Who can handle a plane? - I can. - Anyone else handle a plane? - No, Herr Leutnant. - No, Herr Leutnant. - You don't doubt that I have the experience. - How many flying hours? - Enough. It'll have to be you then. [Kuhnecke] Lohrmann Vogel What about our clothes? We can't go like this. - You mean our uniforms? - Don't be a sentimental fool. Can't expect to escape in these outfits. You're right, for once. Men, this is our one chance of escape. Our only one. We must be ready for it. We must have new clothes, money, food, rifles, ammunition. - Where do you keep the money? - There is none. - Don't lie to me. You sell things here. - Not for money. It's exchange, barter. Plenty of coats, Herr Leutnant [Shouting In Native Language] [All Shouting, Yelling] [Shouting, Yelling Continues] [Engine Stops] What's the trouble at the post? What's happened to the factor? Nothing happen at the post. My son go to white man yesterday. No come back yet. Anybody else at the post? Trapper Johnnie. Stay one day. [Shouting In Native Language] [Eskimos Responding] [Chattering, Laughing] [Chattering Continues] [No Audible Dialogue] I'm a German officer. I warn you not to resist. - Run, Les! - [Hirth] Fire! - Aim low. - [Gunfire] - [Gunfire Continues] - [Hirth] Cease fire! Kranz, stand guard! Kuhnecke and Lohrmann, get the boats loaded. Jahner! Vogel! Report to me when ready! [Door Opens, Closes] Hey, you. Give him some water. It's behind me. You're a Christian, aren't you? No, I'm not. [Water Pouring] [Pitcher Sets On Table] [Whispers] Rosary. What's he trying to say? He wants his rosary. What's the good of that to him? When ... When ... ... we win ... ... the war ... ... we ... ... send you ... ... some ... ... missionaries. All ready, Herr Leutnant. [Albert] Thanks, laddie. [Engine Whining] Contact! [All Murmuring] [All Shouting] I can't take off! We're overloaded! Throw something out! Jahner. That'll do! [Engine Accelerating] Still no use! Everything'll have to go! - Everything! - Throw out the rifles! [Shouting, Cheering] - How low is the gas? - It's all right. Sure we have enough? Our maximum speed seems to be about ... - ... 145 kilometers an hour. - A hundred and sixty. Herr Leutnant, there's a note here. - Can't risk it. - Seems a shorter course. Yes, but longer over the sea. Some of the magnetic variations up here are as much as 40 degrees. By taking 269 degrees... ... we can pick up the bush railway down the coast as far as Lake Winnipeg. But we'll need 15 flying hours. - Do you hear? - I'm not deaf. Well, have we enough gas, or haven't we? Yes! [Engine Knocking, Stalling] - Are we out of gas? - Can't be! [Knocking Continues] [Engine Resumes Power] Emergency tank. Had to switch over, that's all. - I suppose the emergency tank is full. - Of course. When we filled up at Wolstenholme, did you check the emergency tank? Did you check the emergency tank? What difference does it make whether I checked it or not? - Well, did you or didn't you? - Very well then! No! [Engine Stalls, Stops] [Clicking] - You've got us into a mess! - Don't shout at me! I'm trying to take control! - We'll make a forced landing if we have to. - Forced landing? Whats the good of this? We've got 200 kilometers from the border! I can't think of everything, can I? I can't help it if I make a mistake sometimes! Anyway, you're supposed to be in command! Why don't you handle the thing yourself? I wish I could! - We're going to crash! What should we do? - Nothing! Hang on! - There's a lake ahead! - All right! I'm not blind! - Parachute! - Sit down! - We'll never make it! Can't you lift her a little? - Leave me alone, can't you! - Any orders, Herr Leutnant? - No! Save yourselves, if you can! - Jump! - No! Sit down! Hold on tight, everybody. I'm going to try something! [Engine Resumes Power] That's better. Better. [Engine Sputters, Stops] - Throw something out! - What? A cushion! Anything! I can't see the surface! - What is ... This isn't ... - I can't see! I can't see to land! For God's sake, tell me what to do! Out! Out! - I'll get out, Herr Leutnant! - Out! Out! [Coughing] Vogel! Vogel! All right, Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant! He's dead. So that's Kuhnecke. - Look out! A woman! - ## [Singing] ## [Singing continues] [Hirth] German - [Lohrmann] German? - The girl has a German newspaper. - [Lohrmann] Germans here? - Why not? There are half a million of us in Canada. Vogel, go and speak to her. See what you can find out. Don't try to be too clever. Keep as near to the truth as you can. - [Vogel] Hello - Hello. - That's a good-looking scarecrow - Mmm. Why, you're only a kid. I thought you were much older in that getup. I'm 16. Are you looking for work? Yes. How did you know? You don't look like a hobo. - Reaping started? - Just begun. - Are you on your own? - Oh, those. Those are my pals. - [Vogel] All right - I thought they were your pals. - Why? - Seasonal workers always travel in gangs. Well, these are my pals. - This is ... - Anna. Anna. She's 16. It isn't true. I shouldn't lie. I shall be 16 the day after tomorrow. Oh, it's only a difference of two days. Yes, but Peter says there's no difference at all between a small lie and a big lie. - Who is Peter? - [Anna] Our leader - Oh, so you have a leader. - Yes, a wonderful leader You'll meet him Aren't you coming to the settlement? There isn't another for eight miles. I told her we were looking for work. We should be glad to, but, uh, there are four of us. Don't worry. When 111 people sit down for supper, four more won't make any difference. [Lohrmann] Did you say 111? Hmm. What are you? Mormons? Mormons? No. Hutterites. [Laughs] I didn't mean we were all one family. We're only brothers and sisters in God. Hurry up, boy. You are a slow boy. Anna, more bread for our guests. We're sorry about the bread. Mmm. I know a bit about baking. If you don't mind my saying so, you ought to get a new baker. We had a good one, but he went to Small Springs. - Better pay? - Oh, no one gets paid here. - Doesn't anyone get paid anything? - No. Well, what do you work for, then? Just your keep? No. For us all. What, all these people work for nothing? - Yeah. - What sort of work? Whatever suits them best. Well, what do you mean? They don't choose themselves, do they? - Haven't you got a leader of the community? - Yes. There he is over there. Where? Which is your leader? There. Third from the right. Well, doesn't he tell the people what sort of job they've got to do? Oh, no. We tell him what we want to do. Then how can he be your leader? How do you mean? Well, anyone works at whatever job they like, then. Yeah, that's right. If somebody can make shoes, he makes shoes. If he wants to be a blacksmith, he works in the forge. If somebody feels he can preach, well, he preaches. Well, what's your specialty? I'm... the baker. When you sell your stuff in Winnipeg, what happens to the money? We buy new tractors, build houses, found new settlements. We just founded a new one over at Small Springs. And if someone leaves you and then wants to come back, don't you punish them? - Punish? - Yes. Don't you send them to a ... - ... camp or something? - Camp? Why a camp? No, we just take them back because our religion tells us to. - The Hutterite religion? - The Christian religion. - ## [All Singing] - Is it one of your rules to sing like this? We haven't any rules. We sing because we like to. It's good for the digestion. ## [Singing continues] Well, good night. The leader will look after you. - Thank you. - What's the salute? - The what? - Don't you give the leader a salute? [Chuckles] - Good evening, friends. - Good evening. On behalf of my friends and myself, I have to thank you for your... - ... kindness in giving us food and shelter. - You're welcome. I hear you come from up north in the woods, or down north, as we call it here. Yes. - Just come out? - Last week. Are you Germans? I ask, are you Germans? -Yes. -Are you ashamed of it? Of course not. I'll show you where to sleep. [Hirth] Thank you [Man] Most of us are Germans You may find some from the same part of the old country as yourselves Anna, I thought you would have told them all about us. [Vogel] We mostly discussed birthdays. [Chuckles] Well, it's quite an event with us, the 16th birthday. It means that one has grown up at last. Come in, please. This house belonged to Hugo Waldner ... ... one of our brothers who has gone to the new settlement. - At Small Springs? - Yes. You see, we are like bees. If we get too many, we send out a swarm. So the house is empty and at your service. Good night. - Sleep well. - [Hirth] Good night Hmm. That's what I call a busy girl. It's nothing. I make 14 beds every night. Hm. That's a lot of work. You see, we have a lot of men who have no mothers and who aren't married yet. - So somebody has to make their beds. - Quite right. Two of you can sleep in here, and there are two more beds in the other room - Where do you sleep? - In Peter's house. - In Peter's house? - But I don't make the bed for him - Poor Peter. Why not? - Because he has a mother to look after him. [Vogel] Haven't you a mother? No. She was drowned. Drowned? In the sea. When we left Germany ... ... we went to England ... ... because we had to wait until we got a permit to come to Canada. We got our permit after war was declared. - Was your father with you? - Wait a minute. I want to hear about her mother. Her ship was sunk. [Kranz] Torpedoed? - I think so. - Don't you know? - Was there a big explosion? - [Anna Whimpers] Shut up, you two. You and your questions. Don't answer them, Anna Oh, leave that. - Run along now. - I'll take her home. All right, you take her. - Good night, Anna. - Good night. Chins up. [Hirth] Remember then, do nothing without orders Discipline is more important now than ever So far, luck has been with us It's a great stroke of fortune being here at all - Do you think they are friendly, Herr Leutnant? - Friendly? Yes. But you saw how their leader tried to draw us out. "Are you Germans? Are you ashamed of being Germans?" - That in a country with which we are at war. - There can only be one answer to that. Our agents have done their work well. Yes. This religion may be nothing but a cover. I bet they sing the "Horst Wessel" song better than hymns. We shall see that tomorrow. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler! Shut the door. Well, Vogel, who knows? Perhaps one day the story of our adventures will all be written in a book. In a few years time, it may be the basis of compulsory lectures to the Hitler Youth. The ships we sank, with women and children aboard ... ... the lifeboats we shelled. Mmm, we were good at that. What we did to the Eskimos at the post ... ... the unarmed men we shot in the back. You forget, Vogel, we're at war. We can't expect to win without the methods of total warfare. Men, women and children they're all our enemies and must be treated as such. Did you never read what Bismarck said? "Leave them only their eyes to weep with." "Leave them only their eyes to weep with." Did he say that? Those were his actual words in the war of 1870. You should study Bismarck. He was a great German. A great German. You know, Vogel, I'm worried about you. You're a good fellow, but you don't discipline yourself. You give way to emotions That'll land you in trouble one of these days. Why don't you take an example from Kranz, a fine, soldierly fellow. You could be just as good a Nazi as he is if you tried. - Are you listening, Vogel? - Yes, Herr Leutnant. - Then think it over. - Yes, Herr Leutnant. - And get out of bed and turn out the light. - Yes, Herr Leutnant. [Sighs] Vogel, I ... [Snoring] - Herr Leutnant? - Either of you seen Vogel? - No, Herr Leutnant - Well, get dressed at once. - [Woman] Good morning, friend. - Good morning. He's asking for you. Oh? All right. Well? Aren't you going? Well, I can't go till I've got this lot ready. What shall I tell him? I'll be along in a minute. [Chattering] [Man] Now, where's this new baker I hear about, eh? Ah. Now, that's what I call bread. - [All Murmuring Agreement] - [Man] You'll have to teach David the trick [David] Trick or no trick, I could never make bread as good as that Cheer up, David. It took me seven years. - Why ever did you want to give it up? - I didn't want to give it up. I had to. - You see, we all had ... - [Door Slams] [Man] Peter! Just come and look at this bread! Good morning, friend. Mr. Vogel is the best baker we've had here in 15 years. I can't imagine why his last boss let him go. Must have been crazy. If he wasn't then, he is now. Congratulations, Vogel. It was a good idea. Round the barn! What's the news in Winnipeg? The market was good for geese. People are asking for Hutterite geese. I don't like that, Andreas. No? For 300 years our brethren have wandered from place to place ... ... from country to country... ... because of the jealousy of others. This is a good country, Andreas. - I met Frau Habermann. - Yes? Oh, her trial was on today, wasn't it? Her husband and her eldest son, Eric, are to be interned. She is free. Bad luck ... ... just at harvest time. It wasn't a good day for the trial. Papers are full of stories about those Germans who landed from a U-boat down north. They seem to have acted like wild beasts, killing and stealing. - What's Frau Habermann going to do? - I had a talk with her. - She needs help on the farm. - It'll be difficult. We'll talk it over. Tell the others we'll have a meeting tonight, yes? [Exhales] Air's heavy. I'm afraid we're going to have a storm tonight. Sorry. Sorry I'm late, Peter. Barbarina, there's an electric storm playing all around us ... ... frightening the animals and your chickens. - Move over, Philip. - What about you, Anna? - Andreas. - Huh? - One of our guests is speaking. - Eh? What? Oh! Good! We're discussing the Habermanns. I was about to say ... ... you have one clear choice. Where there is a question of blood ... ... where one is governed by the deepest of racial instincts ... ... then every other consideration is swept aside. Men like yourself ... German, or of German ancestry ... ... rise up with all the might and power of the great German people behind you ... ... conscious of the sacred duty that binds us all together ... ... and in the knowledge that he who doesn't forget his people ... ... will not by his people be forgotten. There is a new wind blowing from the east ... ... a great storm coming across the sea ... ... a hurricane which will sweep aside all the old, outmoded ways of life ... ... and mark the beginning of a new order, not only for Europe ... ... but for the whole world. Let those beware who would have the temerity to stand in its way. They will go down before its irresistible impulse ... ... and be crushed out of existence! But for those who accept the new order or those who perhaps belong to it already ... ... why need I use these parables of speech any longer? I mean, all of you here tonight ... ... yes, you, brothers ... I call you brothers and proudly acknowledge you as such. You who formed a little stronghold of our people here in Canada ... ... you will have your share of the happiness and prosperity ... ... that is waiting for us all when the storm is over and the sun rises ... ... that mighty sun ... ... which will give us everything we need in life. What sun are you talking about, friend? I am talking of the greatest idea in history ... ... the supremacy of the Nordic race, the German people. I am talking of the being whose name I am certain lives in every heart ... ... whose name hangs on all our lips ... ... whether we can shout it to the world or only whisper it in one another's ears. Germans! Brothers! I ask you to join with me in paying homage to our glorious Fhrer. Heil Hitler! [Kranz, Lohrmann] Heil Hitler! [Thunder Rumbling] I don't ask where you come from or what brought you here ... ... although you've left us in no doubt as to your beliefs. Someone has given you, no doubt deliberately ... ... a completely false impression of us. We are only one amongst many foreign settlements in Canada. There are thousands of them in this part of the world. And they have been founded, some recently, some 80 years ago ... ... by people who left their homes in Europe because of famine ... ... because of starvation ... ... because of racial and political persecution ... ... and some, like ourselves, because of their faith. Some came only to find new land ... ... new boundaries, a new world ... But all have found here in Canada ... ... the security ... ... the peace and tolerance and understanding ... ... which, in Europe... ... it is your Fhrer's pride to have stamped out. You call us Germans. You call us brothers. Yes. Most of us are Germans. Our names are German. Our tongue is German. Our old handwritten books are in German script. But we are not your brothers. Our Germany is dead. However hard this may be for some of us older people ... ... it's a blessing for our children. Our children grew up against new backgrounds, new horizons. And they are free ... ... free to grow up as children ... ... free to run and to laugh without being forced into uniforms ... ... without being forced to march up and down the streets ... ... singing battle songs. You talk about a new order in Europe. The new order ... ... where there will not be one corner ... ... not a hole big enough for a mouse ... ... where a decent man can breathe freely. You think we hate you, but we don't. It is against our faith to hate. We only hate the power of evil which is spreading over the world. You and your Hitlerism ... ... are like the microbes of some filthy disease ... ... filled with a longing to multiply yourselves ... ... until you destroy everything healthy in the world. No. We are not your brothers. What do you want? I am come to tell you that you can make your own beds. I don't want to work for you. [Vogel] That's all right, Anna Run along now. You're Nazis, aren't you? Aren't you? We're not allowed to hate anybody. But I hate you. I believed you'd escaped from an internment camp. I should tell the police about you. You killed my father ... ... because he said your Fhrer was the Antichrist. You drowned my mother. I hate you. I hate you! So you're going to tell the police about us, are you? Little girls should be seen and not heard. - That will do. - What's the matter with you? - That will do! - Vogel. Come along, Anna. I'll take you home. - Herr Leutnant, we can't let them go. - I'd like to see what you're going to do about it. - Vogel! - Yes, Herr Leutnant. Have you forgotten who you are? - No, Herr Leutnant. - Let the girl go and shut the door. I'll take her home, Herr Leutnant. [Door Closes] Is that you, Anna? Yes, Peter. I brought Anna home. She's all right. We're going now, perhaps in a few minutes. I only wanted to say that you've been kind and I like it here. You like my bread, and I like the way you live. Being with you has made me feel like it used to be at home. I'd almost forgotten what it was like ... ... baking bread, doing my real work. That's how it used to be seven years ago before everything changed. The life I've been living seems to have no sense in it now. Well, I'd better go now. Please don't go. - Are they still talking? - Hush, child. Go to sleep. How can a man like you, Vogel ... I mean, you're a simple, good human being. How can you get mixed up with such a lot of gangsters? What can you do? When you're a boy, you like playing soldiers. When you're a young man, you can't get work unless you belong to them. When you're an old man, you're anxious not to lose what you've got. But there are thousands of men like you, Vogel ... ... men who don't like the way things are going. I suppose so. I suppose they don't know themselves. I didn't know. It's as if a blind man said he doesn't know the sun shines. - I suppose so. - Why don't you stay with us, Vogel? - Do you mean it? - Of course I mean it. Even if you know who I am ... - ... where I come from - I don't care who you are or where you come from. - I know you. - Thank you, Peter. - It will mean internment. - What's it matter? I'll come back after the war. This is your home. ## [Whistling] ## [Whistling Continues] ## [Whistling Continues] - [Hirth] Engine Room Artificer Vogel - ## [Stops] You are under arrest. You are accused of desertion and treachery to the Third Reich. In the absence of a properly constituted court ... ... I assume authority as your superior officer and sentence you to death. Have you anything to say? The sentence will be carried out immediately in the name of the Fhrer. [Gunshots] "Investigations by the R.C.M.P... ... have resulted in finding the remains of a Canadian Airways sea plane ... ... similar to the one stolen by the five Nazis at Wolstenholme. - Give me the glasses. - What for? - Food. - You can't eat them. I can sell them. - They're his. - Come on, come on. They belong to the fatherland. It wouldn't let us starve, would it? Congratulations, Lohrmann. No field glass has ever had a better end. We shall view the future better through these. - [Chuckles] How much did he give you? - Seven dollars. Well, what are you waiting for? You saw what the bulletin said. They're watching the border. But they don't know there are only three of us. They still think there are five. The police aren't fools. They'll find out soon enough. If we're caught, it won't matter whether there are three or five or 10 of us. We're going to change our plans. - We're going to Vancouver. - Vancouver? A Japanese ship leaves Vancouver in a month's time. - Is it far to Vancouver? - About 2,000 kilometers. - We can never get as far as that. - The Fhrer has never admitted the word "can't." Neither should we. Our one consideration must be how to get to ... - [Man] Ham sandwich, sir - How to get home. Doesn't matter how we do it, but we will get home. That's how he works. He says that it's Germany's destiny to rule Europe. Doesn't matter how she achieves that destiny, but she will achieve it. He gave me this. These Canadians give everything away. The road west is plain enough. Follow the River Assiniboine for 50 miles. Do we start now, Herr Leutnant? No... No, we sleep tonight in the railway station. Tomorrow we'll catch a bus outside the city limits, then walk. He wanted us to fly to Vancouver. Said it would save a lot of time. - [Chuckling] What did you say, Herr Leutnant? - I said we had plenty of time. [Horn Honking] [Vehicle Approaching] [Horn Honking] [Spits] - [Vehicles Passing] - [Horn Honking] [Train Whistle Blowing] Those are the Three Sisters Mountains. We're in the park now, Banff National Park Today's Indian Day. It's the biggest crowd of the year. There will be thousands of Indians. You should stop over and see it. I have an appointment in Vancouver. You say these three men were here? Well, they were right here. - Can you describe them? - Well, let me see, now. There's only one that I would remember right well. Corporal! Ladies and gentlemen. [Man] Norman, I'm going to use your mike to talk to the crowd Attention please. The mounted police have reason to suspect that among this crowd ... ... are three enemies of this country. They are not ordinary aliens, escaped from Kananaskis Internment Camp. They are survivors from a German submarine ... ... the notorious U-37, which was sunk in Hudson Bay by our air force. These men are here in this courtyard They may be standing right next to you Each one of you, look closely at your neighbour. These are descriptions of the three men. One, who appears to be the leader ... ... is a well-built man of medium height. He has very definite features, a commanding manner ... ... is clean-shaven, brown hair. He wears a blue suit and tan shoes. ... and carries himself as if he'd been drilled. There is no very good description of the second man. He is thin and inconspicuous in his manner. He wears a suit of some light colour ... ... and a hat tilted over his eyes. He may be carrying a bulky rucksack. The third man is short and dark. He wears no hat. He has a tweed jacket and a bow tie. He carries a parcel wrapped in oilcloth and tied with thick string. He is described as being nervous in his manner. I must ask all of you to stay exactly where you are ... ... and not talk or move. All of you, as citizens, can help to bring these men to justice. Each one of you, look closely at your neighbour. Remember, each one of these men has every reason to be afraid. They've already been responsible for the deaths of 11 defenceless people. Sooner or later, their nerves will crack Look closely at your neighbour - Corporal, there's your man! - [Clamouring] [Clamouring continues] Herr Leutnant, it's a trail. Hmm, come on then. Lost? - Yes. - That's a difficult trail on foot in those outfits. - You walked in from the lodge, I suppose - Yes. - Any plans? - Plans? Well, it'll be dark in an hour. The moon doesn't rise till 11:00. A lot of grizzlies on that trail. - Grizzlies? - Grizzly bears. Touchy beasts. You wouldn't like 'em. [Chuckles] And they wouldn't like you. I see. - [Metal Clanging] - Ah, dinner. You're just in time. George will be pleased. [Speaking Foreign Language] Tricky things, aren't they? The great thing is just to sit still. - On holiday here? - Yes, on holiday. How do you find the lodge? They used to do you a very good lobster thermidor with a red Bordeaux. They still do you a lobster, but no more red Bordeaux. - A nuisance, isn't it? - Hmm? The war, I ... Anyhow, up here in the Rockies ... ... the war seems so remote, one can't take it so seriously. Of course one knows one half of humanity is trying to wipe out the other half, but ... ... up here among the mountains and the spruce forests ... ... one sees it in perspective. So that it ... it seems almost unimportant. You've chosen a very beautiful place for your holiday. Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it? Actually, I'm here to work ... on a book. - Oh, so you're a novelist? - [Chuckling] Well, I write books. My specialty is Indians. This has been a hunting ground of theirs for generations. Then I ... I suppose you were at Banff today. For Indian Day? No, no, no. That's just for tourists. Oh, I beg your pardon. Ship ahoy! Well, gentlemen. Welcome to my humble tepee. Got two this time, George I'm improving. And tell Bob two more for dinner. Well. It must be very pleasant roughing it up here in the mountains. Yes, I rather like pigging it occasionally. I hope you won't mind taking potluck with me. Here, have a cigarette. Ah, I see you're looking at my Picasso. Nice, isn't it? Here. How do you feel about Matisse? I picked these up about a year ago, and I can't bear to be parted from them. How do you like it, hmm? - Excellent. - [Chuckles] I don't think you two are really interested in pictures. Well, my motto is, wars may come and wars may go ... ... but art goes on forever. Ah, you like reading, don't you? Have you seen Hemingway's latest? Here. I'm going to show you one of my pets. There. Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain This is the German edition. [Chuckling] This is wonderful stuff. [Reading In German] By the way, do you speak German? Have you read this book? Thomas Mann is very good, I believe. I'm so sorry. Of course, you'll want a bath after your long climb. I'm afraid I can only offer you a shower. Come on. I'll show you the way. - Thank you very much, Mr ... - Scott. Philip Armstrong Scott. Come on. Philip Armstrong Scott. Ah, hot water. I feel completely confident tonight. If we'd twice as far to go, I wouldn't worry now. What could these weaklings ever do to us? The man's country's at war and look at him. I tell you, Lohrmann, they're rotten to the core. There's no fight in them. They're soft and degenerate all through. No, I'll have cold. [Gasps] [Scott] George, the fire's smoking. South-southeast by south Ah, that's the ticket Yes, I've discovered some rather amusing things during my researches. Blackfoot tribal customs, for instance, closely resemble those ... ... of a certain modern European tribe. I'm going to read you something about that. Where are we? "From the earliest age, their small boys were trained in the arts of war ... "... which they considered to be the only pursuit worthy of a man. "But they preferred to attack by night, rather than by day ... "... and wherever possible, to shoot the enemy in the back. "Their smaller neighbours lived in constant danger from them. "They also believed in first terrorising their opponent ... "... by covering themselves in war paint and beating loudly on their tribal drums." Well, doesn't that sound familiar to you? Familiar? - I don't quite understand. - Well, what price Goebbels, eh? - Very similar. - Yeah, you see, don't you? And listen to this. This is wonderful. Come here, sit down. Ahh ... oh, yes. "When a tribal leader really desired to drive a point home ... "... he used that most terrible of all public speaker's weapons: Repetition ... "... constant and unutterably wearisome repetition." Old man Hitler himself. ## [Harmonica] ## [Continues] - What's wrong? - I think he found it a little warm in here. I'm so sorry. - Well, rather stuffy in there, eh? - A little. Lovely night, isn't it? The moon's just out. - [Laughing] - We're not the only ones up, I see. - The men, eh? - When do they go to bed? Oh, pretty early as a rule. They please themselves. You must be rather tired yourself. How about a nightcap before you turn in? - Thank you. - Yes. Well. Interested? Have a drink? [Chuckles] ##[Stops] Well, happy dreams. [Shudders] [Spits] [Man] Okay Ah, I thought you'd find it a bit chilly. We're 6,000 feet up here, you know? - So you think you'll escape the war, Mr. Scott? - Hmm? - That's not a very nice way of putting it. - But you'll do your best to escape it. Do you mean I'm ... I wonder if I am. I don't think I'm a coward. I've never really been in any great danger. I don't exactly know how I'd behave. - I can imagine how you'd behave. - I beg your pardon? I said, "I can imagine how you'd behave." [Chuckles] Hmpf. Well, you are an extraordinary fellow. You're certainly frank. So you despise my mode of life, eh? Well, I'm getting some revelations tonight. Maybe it'll do me good. Maybe I'm becoming a little smug. I imagined you'd been thinking, "Here's a nice, decent sort of chap. "Invites me to dinner when he doesn't even know me. Amiable. Full of interesting conversation." And instead of that, you think I'm ... Go on, what do you think I am? This ought to be enlightening. If you were a real man, you'd have struck me across the face when I suggested you were a coward. Instead of which, you talk about it. Well, why not? I may write about the customs of red Indians 200 years ago ... ... but I don't have to behave like one. After all, we've been given reasoning powers and the gift of speech. Why don't we use them instead of hitting each other? Come on, have a cigarette. I don't think you're even a coward. I don't think you're a man at all. You must've had too much to drink. You both better get to bed. Is this gun loaded? Of course it's loaded. Then put your hands up. - What do you mean? - It's quite plain. Put them up. Well, well, well. This is a new experience. So I've been entertaining gangsters. Well, what do you want? Money or what? You don't believe we'd shoot you, do you? Such a thing couldn't happen to Mr. Philip Armstrong Scott. Anything unpleasant must be kept as far away as possible ... ... as far as the war, 5,000 miles away. Suppose I was to tell you that the war is right here in this tent? I don't suppose you've heard of the U-boat that was sunk in Hudson Bay ... ... and the six Germans who escaped. So that's who you are Nazis. Well, that explains everything. Your arrogance, your stupidity, your ... - ... bad manners - Get over there by your books! Oh, dear. Do I have to be tied up? Excuse us, Mr. Scott. We still employ savage, tribal methods. They get results. The best thing that's happened to us is meeting you. Youve put the heart back into us. There are only two of us now. Two out of six brave men. There are millions like us in Germany. Any more of your sort here, you don't stand a chance of an English war. Well see to that. - Get the clothes out of there. - They won't suit you. Not much there, I'm afraid. - Thirty-three dollars. - Do I get a receipt? There's only one suit here You better have the overcoat. Interesting. So far, I don't feel the least afraid. No sign of trembling. Pulse appears to be quite steady. Mouth a bit dry perhaps. Here. Rifles. Ah, you feel happier now, don't you? Look out. Wars may come and wars may go, but art goes on forever, eh? Stop! Thomas Mann. Yes, I have read this book. We kicked this swine out of the Reich years ago. There's something else too "Blackfoot Tribal Customs" Think yourself lucky we don't burn you too. Well, I never would've believed that grown-up men ... ... could behave like spiteful little schoolboys. Have I said something to annoy you? Then, I forget, anything reasonable annoys you. - Open your mouth. - One question, please. When Hitler's making a speech, just exactly what are your reac... Damn them horses. Stampeded again. - Maybe they got wind of something - [Man #2] Maybe a bear - [Whinnying] - There. There they go. [Whinnying] [Whispers] This way. Who's been leaving a saddle out here? Confound it! Here's another one. Boss must've gone crazy. You've made a fine mess of things. You've roused the whole camp. The horses were your idea. I knew they'd give trouble. - You forget yourself, Lohrmann. - Save your breath, Hirth. Hey, Bob! They're gone down by the lake! Hirth! Not that way! - Who are you talking to? - You're not my superior officer now. - Obey orders and follow me! - Orders be ... All right. Come on, George. Art! Art! Where are you? - Here, Mr Scott! - [Scott] On the trail - [Groans] - By the waterfall - Hurry! - Okay, boss, coming! - [Scott] Bob! Bob! - [Man] Over here! Bob, Bob, Mr Scott wants you! [Bob] Okay! - What's happened, Boss? - A holdup. Those two fellas ... - No! - Yes. - Oh, there's one of them. - Good old George. - [Man Shouts] - Right here! Coming your way! - [Shouting, Indistinct] - [Shouts] Where are you? - Looks like he's lost it. - Confound it. He's got it, the old bloodhound. Come on. - [Scott] Where is he, George? In the cave? - [George Grunts] What are we waiting for? Let's get him. - Which one of them two is it, Boss? - I don't know. Did you see, George? All right, George? I forgot to tell you, Art. He's got my Colt, too. See that hole? That's gonna cost him seven bucks before I let the Mounties get him. That means he's got four shots left. All right, Bob I'll take over now. Okay, Boss, but I don't think you ought to take any ... - The papers say these men are killers. - Yes, the Canadian papers. The Nazi papers call them heroes. Two brave Nazis against 11 million Canadians. Say, Mr Scott. Mr Scott. - Stop him - [Gunshot] One. - [Gunshot] - Two. - [Gunshot] - Three. - [Gunshot] - Four. That's the lot. - Oh, it's you. I hoped it was the other fellow. - [Scuffling] - [Scuffling continues] - [Scott] That's for Thomas Mann - [Blows Landing] - That's for Matisse ... - [Scuffling Continues] - That's for Picasso ... - [Blows Landing] - And that's for me. All right, you can fetch him out now. You all right, Boss? Well, you can't expect me to capture an armed Nazi without getting hurt a little. - Yet ... - Here. Let me have a look at that. The boss has knocked him cold. Well, he had a fair chance. One armed superman ... ... against one unarmed decadent democrat. I wonder how Dr Goebbels will explain that. "Leutnant Hirth ... "... wherever you may be on the North American continent ... "... I hail you as the paladin of the Third Reich ... "... and the upholder of the honour of the great German people. "By express order of the Fhrer himself... "... you have today been invested with the iron cross, first class. Heil Hitler." "Flash: Lethbridge, Alberta. Mounted police pick up trail of escaping Nazi. "At Lethbridge Airport, Kenyon Field ... "... it's been established that a man resembling the wanted man ... ... Lieutenant Hirth, planed in yesterday on Trip 22 from Edmonton and Calgary " "The hearts of all sympathisers with the German cause go out to Leutnant Hirth. "One man against 11 million. "They know that even now, the odds are not too heavy ... "... when the one man represents the might of the Third Reich ... ... and the 11 million, a collapsing democracy." "Forty-eight hours have elapsed and still Lieutenant Ernst Hirth... "... the only surviving Nazi from the U-37, is at large. "The whole world's eyes are on southern Ontario. The question of the hour is: Where is Hirth?" You'll be okay here. I'll let you know when you get to the falls. - Much obliged. Say, what's your name? - Oh, forget it. I haven't seen you and you haven't seen me. Hello. You bummin' a ride? - Yes. - You needn't be afraid of me. I won't split on you. I'm not afraid. Looks like you got a nice private car. Have a cigarette. Sit down. Thank you. - Comin' from Toronto? - Yes. - Livin' there, maybe? - No. - Quite a place, Toronto. - I didn't see much of it. - Are you from the west? - Well, I've been there. - Vancouver? - Yes. That must be a beautiful city, Vancouver. I didn't stay there long either. - You don't stay long anywhere, do you? - Well, I travel about a good deal. Travel about. That's a lot of fun. When I was a kid, I had the big idea to see the whole of Canada. But things don't work out the way you think. I save a bit of money, and what do I do? Put it in my pocket and start off down the road ... ... my own boss, with the whole of Canada in front of me? Not on your life. I buy a bit of land up Beamsville way. And that keeps me so busy, that's about all of Canada I see. Have a shot of Ontario wine. Catawba. I send the grapes to the winery from my own farm. - Sherry-type. - Thank you. Got a kick like a mule. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Sometimes I think I'll take a holiday. But do I take a holiday? Not a bit of it. - I take a wife. - [Brakes Squeal] Say, were there any M.P.'s around while you've been here? - MP's? - Military Police. - Are you in trouble with the police? - Not exactly what you'd call trouble. I just don't wanna meet 'em, that's all. - Are you a soldier? - Well, that's a matter of opinion. That's what I joined up to be. The government said, "We want men to fight the Nazis. Join today." So I joined. I figured they were in a hurry. That was 387 days ago. Four divisions and a lot of drafts have gone overseas ... ... and what's Number B-987642 doing? Guardin' the Chippewa Canal. Who'd wanna steal it anyway? - [Bell Ringing] - [Train Rattling] Well, I guess I better climb back into my battle rompers. Do you think your government have treated you badly? Well, what do you think? I didn't enlist to play nursemaid. I enlisted to knock hell out of the Nazis. I'm about as close to getting my hands on a Jerry now as I was at the beginning. We don't eat so good Holy mackinaw, beef, three times a day. Haven't tasted parsnips since I joined the army. - I'm fond of parsnips, too. - Why are you afraid of the police? Who's afraid of the police? Just overstayed my leave eight days. That is a serious offense in wartime. - Says who? My CO? - You're a deserter. Deserter, my Royal Canadian foot. I'm just independent. You're a deserter because you have a legitimate grievance against your democratic government. Say, where did you pick up those five-gallon words? You have a good suit. Sure, it's a good suit. Paid 25 bucks for it two years ago. And along comes that heel, Hitler. - It's a very good suit. - It's a dandy suit. Just now, most of the boys are wearin' these. Yes. - Well, I'm a son of a ... - Stand up. Put your hands up. Stand over there. Unless you're anxious to be shot, you won't move. [Footsteps] I'm perfectly ready to kill you or anyone else. Yeah, I can see you are. - Fourteen drums of carbide. - Don't move. - [Man #2] Fourteen drums - Who's movin'? Nine cans germicide. Okay. Everything checks all right. Okay, then seal her up. [Train Whistle Blows] Now look what you done. I am a deserter now. - What do you mean? - They're taking us clear out of the country. - Out of the country? - Into the States. We're crossin' the border now. Into America? Heil Hitler. - Dirty Nazi. - Yes, I'm a Nazi. Heil Hitler. - One of them off the U-boat. - Quite right, my friend. In two minutes, I shall be across the border. Once there were six of us. Now I represent them all. Field Marshall Gring has said ... "It doesn't matter as long as we have only one plane and one man left, ... so long as victory is ours. - [Rumbling] - Do you hear that? We've beaten these dirty democracies, these weaklings. I tell you, we've something inside us ... ... something beyond the dim, muddied minds of you in the democracies. What do you know of the glorious, mystical ties of blood and race ... ... that unite me with every German Aryan? When I step on American soil, I shall not be alone. Adolf Hitler and all the great German people will be with me. - [Spits] - It is not the Canadian people we're against. It's your filthy government, the whole democratic system. You don't like it any more than I do. You don't like the job they've given you. - You don't like the food. You said so yourself. - Why, you spoon-fed louse. I can grouse about the food and the C.O. And anything I blame please. And that's more than you with your Gestapo and your storm troopers ... ... and your Aryan putschwehr. Aw, nuts. What's the good of talkin' to you? You can't even begin to understand democracy. We own the right to be fed up with anything we damn please ... ... and say so out loud when we feel like it. And when things go wrong, we can take it. We can dish it out too. [Man] Hey, Eddie. Wait a minute Hold the door Thanks. - Hey, Eddie - Yeah. - You check and I'll mark. - How about you checkin'and me markin', ... this brush stings. Go on and wrestle some boxes. It'll be good for you. Yeah, sure, sure. Hey. Lady Godiva - Who are you two? - I'm Andrew Brock, Canadian Active Service Force. You look it. And you? - We're on American territory? - Yes. I am Ernst Hirth, a German citizen. I demand to be taken to the nearest German consulate. Don't do it. Send him back. He's an escaping Nazi. He slugged me. That's my uniform. - Hey, this gun is loaded. - No. By your American law, you must take me to my consul. - Is that right? - I'm afraid it is. - He's one of that gang off ... - ... the German submarine, the U-37. - On the level? I am Leutnant Hirth of the German Navy and also a German citizen. - And I demand ... - You've got to send him back. He's not just an escaping Nazi. He's important. The whole German nation is waiting to see if he can get away with it. - I know. I read the papers. - Hey, couldn't we sort of ... you know? - You mean? - Yeah. - No. - By your own law, you must take me to my consul. Sometimes I think we got too many laws. - Don't let him pull that law stuff! - You know better than that, soldier. I'm a Customs Inspector. This is for the Immigration Department. My job's inspecting and checking on freights and imports. Listen, Captain. What would you do if he were an illegal shipment of ... cheese? Return him. But he's a human being. - At least he's a Nazi. - He's not on the manifest, is he? - What? - I said, "He's not on the manifest." - No. - No. No, he's not. - The American law ... - Aw, shut up. I know the law. It says, "Imports are not admissible unless properly manifested" I find two items not listed. - How do you check? - Same way. Two unlisted items. But your law refers to freight, not to persons. This is a freight car, and you're freight. - Tell the engineer to return this car. - Okay. Phone those Canucks and tell 'em it's coming with two items missing from the manifest. - Tell 'em to either list 'em or take 'em off - Check. Thanks, Colonel. Thanks a million. We've all got to do our duty, soldier. - I'll send your gun back to the Mounties. - Okay. I don't need it. But I protest. You cannot do this. It's illegal. Sonny boy, I've done it. Hello, Macaulay? It's Eddie speakin'. We're sendin' back car number 8772. Gee, you guys are gettin' careless. There's two items not in the manifest. - Now, either list 'em or take 'em off. - [Train Whistle Blows] [Engine Starts] Put 'em up, Nazi. No, not that way. This way. Cause I'm not askin' for those pants. I'm just takin' 'em. [Punch Lands] .
