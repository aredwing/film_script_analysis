It's recording, by the way Bloody hell... who'll tell me, your father? Ya, but the picture is black-black. Remove the cover na, oaf! Now? Ya, but earlier it was all black... But now it is black and white... But you can see now? Ya", yap away! Hi. Myself Dev. Dev... stick to Hindi, so you can actually talk... ...and we can understand. Atta boy. Hello. I am Dev... and this is my best friend Tutu. And we are both... Rascals Hey, open the gate... hey open it, it's the Minister Sir, the train is about to come... Open it man.. open it! We are getting late you fool... ...you want me to get out there and tell you? Oye, don't open it. Do you want get Mr. Minister killed? lam stuck in the middle man. My words must sting you right now sir. But just imagine, the gate opens and your car crosses... ...and it stalls right in the middle of the tracks... ...just then the train comes! Have you thought about it? Like a lamb to the slaughter! Someone gag this foul-mouthed fool... hey, HEY, HEY! Stay away... No touching... Even I am in politics. Will you shut up only when I kill you? Okay bro... raise the crossing... The minister has to leave us. Be alert, the whistle is blowing. Your ticket has been cut, up you will be going. I will blow your whistle. Leave me! I, Surra Pehelwan promise you this. Bring this prick in. Why did we turn out like this? The fact is, if Gandhi was born to Hitler... ...he wouldn't be Gandhi, he would be a Nazi. Meaning my dear, a child can be born anywhere... ...but the place he was raised in, decides what he becomes. No one knows where we were born... ...but we were found in a garbage can... ...getting our faces licked by stray dogs. Bhaiyaji raised us So, we grew up to be Bhaiyaji's own. We grew up on gunshots, instead of lullabies. At an age when should've picked up pencils, we picked up pistols. Instead of A for Apple, B for Ball We picked up M for murder and C for crime. Till the age of 13, we endured pain At 15... ...we started giving it back... And at 18... ...we had our first taste of blood. Even a dog barks for you if you feed him a bone and pet his tummy... So, we always bark for Bhaiyaji. Ya, and we bite for him too. Two shadows descend upon a tarry road Each breastfed on gulps of blood Bastard children of the night, perhaps Abandoned by earth, orphaned by the skies... Their story, this, a tale of crumpled lives. Look... a silly star in the sky, Stuck forever, the poor guy. This sorry earth, spinning dizzy, Twists and turns all day, just to get by. We too, must not get Stuck in between Stop this spinning! Life's too short, to just be living So, my friend... my fellow king Live, & die, because tomorrow is just a lie All we have is today! K - K - KILL - da Dil K - K - KILL - da Dil K - K - KILL - da Dil K - K - KILL - da Dil Life makes you pay dearly, It's such a raw deal It's a long, bumpy truck ride, And there's never a free meal Even these breaths we borrow will escape us tomorrow. We seek a home, around every bend, Only the road knows, where it will end. So live it up A day or two, More or less. Let's drink up Buddy, even if it's our tears... Friends & friendships Will last forever, This stream of stars, Will shine, wherever Cause mate, the shiniest of all of them is you... K - K - KILL - da Dil K - K - KILL - da Dil K - K - KILL - da Dil K - K - KILL - da Dil If we didn't have to peel these nuts, and there were no 'lfs & Buts'... ...life would have been so simple. Namaste Bhaiyaji! Just water, or something with some water. Today, it has to be with some water Bhaiyaji. Meaning Minister Surra Pehelwan has ascended from earth. More like nailed to it. With a 100 grams of hot lead inside him. Why're you so sad Batuk? Couldn't steal candy from the kids today? One day show them, what you're made of. But get me a napkin first. Good show. Bhaiyaji, It's just a good time. It's good that the times are good. Bhaiyaji, you're always spoiling us. Tell me... ...do people turn into stars after they die? That's what the living seem to think So how many of these stars did we 'make'? 11... counting today's kill. Dude, that guy must still be enroute... he wouldn't reach that fast. Look at him go... our Star. Okay, so tell me... ...how many of these must be rascals? Rascals? Only 2. You... ...and I. Here, stamp me! Sir, stags are not allowed Sir, there don't have stags. No problem, we only want whiskey. Stamp! No problem, we only want whiskey. Stamp me! Sir... men alone are not allowed. Men alone! Should've got aunty along Sir! This man wants to say something to you. ls he allowed in? He is the father... everyone's father!! Who let the dogs out... Dude, I don't get these songs. If you ear's are numb, chew some gum. What would you like to order sir? Yaar, get me some beer-sheer. Pitcher or mug? No pictures. Get us one bottle with two glasses. Now race like a bullet and fetch like an arrow. Ok sir. Who let the dogs out... Atta boy! Bro, she's coming here. Dude, English... talk in English. Arre Uncle... why bore a hole through that menu card... ...just for a few glimpses... ...here, stare all you want... ...after all isn't this, why we girls deck up... ...so that 'young at heart' leeches like you can lech at us... No? Prick! Sorry... sister. That's a sparkling Diwali firecracker. Oye Uncleji! Happy Diwali. Bro that chick is too sweet. Sorry. Yup, and she is always giving off heat. What the hell are you doing? Dude, that idiot's pulled out a gun. He's showing off, won't fire. Let be dude, you don't know how to fire And you're an expert on shooting guns? Bloody lady-fingers, you don't need fingers to shoot, you need guts. I've been shooting guns... ...since the time you weren't even inside your mother... ...you were still inside your father. Now you wanna get out or get done? Buzz off or I'll turn you into a star. Thank God you intervened otherwise anything could have happened. Thanks. This calls for a hug... Thanks. Yeah... It's a good thing I came, or anything could've happened. What was the matter? Nothing... we were dancing and he felt me up here... ...so I felt him up some here... ...just a little harder than him... did I do any wrong? Not at all... just repaid with interest. O great grandson of Nero. Hello friend!... Rome is in flames... shall we leave? Because of you the club has shut down. Why don't you guys come over to our place? w-w-wh-what? Just come with us...

It's all right Wow! ls this your's? It is for now. Can I ride? If you can start it, you can ride it. One of you can come in my car. That'll be me... You can take the highway to hell. Take care. I said... Dev's hanging with such dumbasses. Arre I was getting free booze... ...forget those dumbasses, I would've gone with 'this' dumb-ass too. I love bullets. Whaat? Arre why are you being a girl... you can sit closer. By god... what a scent. So what were you saying? I love Bullet... bikes. Even we love bullets... firing them... riding them. - Can I ask you a question? - You can ask two. You felt no fear when you saw the gun? Fear... huh... Fear is afraid of us madam. Thank god I didn't fear... If I did, I would be going home with Tutu, and not you. You could've gotten shot. There's no bullet in the world that can touch this body madam. It's better I get shot than you... The bugger is flirting. Did I overdo it...? Did you say something? - Nope. - Then say something na... You look like a ruffian, but you are quite sweet. If only you knew the reality... you'd drop dead madam. Thank you. Ask me something else na. Jenny, Chimsy, Pratty... and I am Disha. All that is fine... but where's the wine? That way. You know if he doesn't get his booze on time, he gets a hangover. The bar is open guys. Oh bar! Bar is open. Got you to the right place, didn't I? Will you take it with water? I think my mouth's watering enough... I'll take just the alcohol. Cheers guys! So do all of you guys just keep blowing away your dad's riches? Dad's... we're blowing away our own! You guys earn your own? It doesn't look like you guys do! Ya! Jenny's a chain snatcher, Chimsy's a pickpocket... Pratty and I drug people, and pull off train robberies. Well, that makes us sharpshooters. Anyway, Jenny's a doctor... Chimsy's a singer and Pratty has his own business. You did not ask about us? How can we resist, when you insist? lam Dev and this is my best friend, Tutu. Hi Hello! So what do you guys do? - We're murd... - Mur... Marketers... Boss gives the targets, we finish them. What kind of targets? Targets of all kinds... they can be thin, fat, small, large... anything You didn't say what do you do? Are you serving it with the frying pan?! P ratty! He's always fingering the hot stuff. You didn't say what do you do? Are you okay? I am so Sorry. Uh huh... you know what they say in films...

Nope, right now... Now? Where? Leave right now! Whaat? Leave right away! Bye! Why here, at Kutub Minar? If we were in Paris, it would've been the Eiffel tower... ...if in Agra, then the Taj Mahal... - ...and if in Mumbai - The Taj Mahal hotel? God-gifted you are! All the crazy decisions I've taken in life, started out here... ...the decision to quit medicine... ...to refuse dad's business, and to start reforming criminals... ...to break up with my last boyfriend and kick him out... ...all those decisions... right here. So what decision are you going to take today? Today, you are going to make a decision, not me. You're not just fooling around with me right? Are you high? Then straighten me out... tell me the truth. If you want to leave me, do it today... Don't wait for tomorrow ...because I'm really serious about us. If you leave me today, I'll handle it... ...but any later... I'll not be able to take it Dev. Any later...? I'll not be able to take it, even if you leave me today... So do you wanna get married? Will you? You will! A dream has stirred awake from slumber An epic waits to unfold The rain is bathing itself in her beauty, The waters shimmer in flames of gold. The damned, are now the blessed, Who find, good deeds to be wretched, What do I do? What do I do, love? This fully clad body, by a naked soul is possessed. I can feel the warm embrace of life again, This heart has got its lost love back. I've spent many insipid nights and days, You've breathed back the flavours, I lack. Drifters, alike, we were, Our wandering, too, was akin Unwise, we always err, But this madness, is difficult to pin. Prostrated, I sing prayers, far & wide, In the city my beloved occupies. You earn yours here, prayer by prayer, God blesses for free; It's lies A dream has stirred awake from slumber An epic waits to unfold The rain is bathing itself in her beauty, The waters shimmer in flames of gold. I can feel the warm embrace of life again, This heart has got its lost love back. Drifters, alike, we were, Our wandering, too, was akin Unwise, we always err, But this madness, is difficult to pin. Prostrated, I sing prayers, far & wide, In the city my beloved occupies. You earn yours here, prayer by prayer, God blesses for free; It's lies When a dog goes rabid... ...he has to be put down. And Dev's gone totally rabid. So, Bhaiyaji should I put Dev down? If Tutu... I mean... if he finds out... He'll kill me Bhaiyaji. - Will he find out? - No Bhaiyaji. He will not. You're going to lose your cherry today... ...carry a charm. Do you want a kiss or coffee? Coffee. Okay! Yes Bhaiyaji. ls Dev there? He's gone out Bhaiyaji. I was inside... I don't know what the guys said to Batuk... ...he's left blabbering that he's going to finish Dev... ...and carve a place for himself... ...so I need you to handle it... Just handle them! Dev! Pick up the phone Dev. Hello. My heart felt wishes on your union. Who's this? I'm your well wisher... ...don't hang up, this is for your benefit. What do you want? I just wanted to know what is it that you eat everyday... ...that has made you blind to such lies. What lies? The lie that your darling Dev is living, but you can't see. How do you know Dev? I know Tutu also. What do you know? Nice! Now that's cheating... ...you need to try harder and figure this riddle out. Okay... Let me give you a hint. What was Dev's past, is now Tutu's present. So now if you want to find out what Dev used to be... ...you need to find out what Tutu is. Gotta hang up now... already spent a bomb. Dev! What's going on I just got a phone call? Hey Dev... ...your ticket's confirmed now. What was Dev's past, is now Tutu's present. So now if you want to find out what Dev used to be... ...you need to find out what Tutu is. When I talk to her... I want to be able to look into her eyes, not shy away. The day she finds out 'what you are' she won't even spit in your face. A pawn... ...is carefully brought to the eigth row... ...so that he can make way for the Queen. Welcome Dev. Madam this dead man, do you know him? No sir. Any idea... who shot him? No sir, we were inside packing our bags when he heard the shots. When we came out he was lying here. I called the ambulance first, then we called you. That's all sir. Alright. If we need you we will call you again. Rest I've already discussed the details with your dad. Okay?... Take care. - Thank you sir. - Let's go! Sit. Listen to me carefully. lam no longer indebted to you... Today I've paid all your favours back. We're done. What you do after today... is your problem. What I will do, is only my problem. You can keep what was yours in this relationship... I've given up what was mine... ...there is no 'US' anymore. I've said what I wanted to... ...and I want to hear nothing you will want to say. It's all over man... You can never tell what's going on in someone's head. He was a good cook though. Anyway, it must've been his time to go... ...let's worry about the one who's time it's going to be. Your faces tell me, you know him. Babban Pehelwaan. He's a tough nut Bhaiyaji. It's not like we're angels. Somewhere, stuck, lies a moment, Entwined in the threads of time, perhaps. Where there's a heart, there will be ache, There's no remedy for this, perhaps. What are you looking at, never seen a handsome man before? C'mon interview me. For a job? For a girl. Tutu, you were right, a swine should stick to feasting on just crap. Trying a cake, will give it nothing but diarrhoea. Madam. And here I was thinking, this is a strange problem man... I hope Disha doesn't find out that I was a bad man once... ...and I hope that Bhaiyaji doesn't find out that I'm a good man now! The stars are spent, My love, Smudged black, this night sky, You work so hard to reform criminals... ...and you've reformed so many of them... ...you reformed one guy accidentally... ...but you probably didn't realize it... Bad bloody luck. Can't get enough of it. Blinded, I can see no more, through The cobwebs spun in my eye. Bruised, by the chores of the heart, Love What is it? Get lost. I never meant to hurt you... ...but still I am sorry for all the trouble. Just pray I don't shoot someone today. Still, nothing is sweeter than her memories Rid me of this hamper of agonies. I lost you because I used to take lives... Bruised, by the chores of the heart, Love ...maybe lfl give up my own, I could get you back... Battered, I'm, by the chores of the heart Dev!! Deeeeeevvvvl! What happened?! I don't know what tomorrow holds... but you take care. Sweeta my Sweeta, without you Darker than the night, are my days... without you Dev! Dev! Life hands a messy deal Lifetimes, bartered for split seconds I'm Baavraa, Baavraa... the crazy heart. Life hands a messy deal Lifetimes, bartered for split seconds I'm Baavraa, Baavraa... the crazy heart. Where's Dev? We're at the hospital! What is wrong with you guys? Death does not scare me, but, Without you, it would be an ordeal If it is life I must endure, then too Without you, it would be an ordeal In my heart I house, A trembling flame, As I take your leave... Life hands a messy deal Lifetimes, bartered for split seconds I'm Baavraa, Baavraa... the crazy heart. Life hands a messy deal Lifetimes, bartered for split seconds I'm Baavraa, Baavraa... the crazy heart. Excuse me madam... ...have we met before? The bugger is flirting again. By God, you are god-gifted. I love you! Dear Bhaiyaji, any last wish. All my life, I've pulled out many a pictures from my pocket... Just never thought my picture will land up here. If you want to shoot... shoot. Don't stare and waste my time. Blood runs down the iron sky, The sun starts to melt to gold. An evening slowly sinks behind us, A morning will silently, unfold. What did you do before this? Before this I was a mur...! Mar... marketer sir! If you were a marketer why did you do an MBA? Sir, actually... ...my little brother and his wife forced me to. I concede, Love is not a slave to the world All is well, if the heart is brave & bold A defeat at the hands of love, laccept My man, this is the chance To burn-n-soar, this is your chance The miracle of love, a pyre that turns you into fire When the pyre turns you to fire...
