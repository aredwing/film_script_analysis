O.K., knucklehead, don't let any Germans in here. Next time he calls me knucklehead, I'm not going to let him in. He'd love that. It's about time you gentlemen got around to photographing my outfit. You seem proud of your group, sergeant. Take guys like Colonel Brickley and Major Hardin. They were born with propellers in their mouths. He's got a propeller in his mouth, too. It takes a good man on the ground to keep them together. What I go through! Dolan this, Dolan that. If I wasn't here, the outfit would fold. O.K., gentlemen. Hang around till you spot them and go down the runway for your pictures. Thank you. How about taking a picture of me for your paper? Tell them how I run the outfit. Thanks. If anybody bothers you, you just tell them that Sergeant Dolan OK'd you. Where's that crack outfit of ours? They were due 20 minutes ago. If they were due 20 minutes ago, they'll be here 20 minutes ago. Jughead, ain't you got that auxiliary tank filled yet? There's 110 gallons of gas in it. Why don't you help? I don't like those tanks. If I was flying, I'd drop them. General Gilbert says don't drop 'em. He ain't flying. I'd hate to have a German chasing me with 110 gallons of gas on my belly. You know that Swiss watch you sold me last week? It was made in Czechoslovakia. You know how those Swedes get around. At ease. Be careful, Wilbur. Whenever there's officers around, you don't have to salute me. Any calls? Sybil's mother called... Three times! I told her the general sent you to Italy. You're using your head. You're going to get these stripes and a decoration. The Iron Cross... Very few Americans get them. Clean up the jeep and throw some soap in the back. Are you giving soap away? No. I let them wash their face, and I take it back. Let a cat out. The only cat left has a white paw. Use shoe polish. Blacken it. You'll get in trouble. Let me worry about that. I'm running this outfit. That's right. I forgot. Oh. The cat. They're 24 minutes late, sir. I know, Dolan. Watching the clock won't help. I brought those photographers. Want me to drive them back? No. Put that sign up. Another sign? If these signs get any lower, only midgets and dogs will be able to read them. Get a load of that one. "A man who wants to get married hasn't got his mind on fighting..." Till he meets his wife's family. That'll do, sergeant. Post the weather report. Dolan, look who's here. What, again? The pilots can't find that black cat here. Where'd you take him last time? Halfway to the village! This time, take him beyond the village. Any particular village? Anyplace! Here you are, Wilbur. Bye, pussy. Pussy, go that way. I'm going this way. Haystack, this is Yardstick. We have two cripples. Have the ambulance and crash truck stand by. We'll circle till you clear us to come in. Come in. Land to the west if you can. Colonel Brickley, what happened to Major Hardin? We don't know. Dudley and Clement got it. We had it today. It's Hardin I'm worried about. Relax, Stu. He may be O.K. I'm supposed to fly his wing. You had M.E.S on you. How could you know he was going after those Jerries? Where's Brickley? Control tower. They may have picked him up. All right. Go ahead. Did you hear from Ed on the R.T. After he hit the deck? We're going to the tower. They might have. Hey, Jacobs! Did you see anything of Major Hardin? The last I saw was... There's old 18,000-feet himself. How does he find out? Every time one of his rules is broken, he's here. Comes in like a hungry beagle. If Ed doesn't come back, Gilbert will kill himself so he can haunt him. Captain Hamilton. General Gilbert. Captain Chappell, Lieutenant Atkins. What happened to Hardin? Missing, sir. Not shot down, I hope? We don't know, sir. You're his wing man? Yes, sir. Captain Hamilton was under attack himself, sir. Hardin went down to the deck again? Lieutenant Dudley was getting shot to pieces by three 109s. Colonel Brickley's in the control tower trying to get some trace of Hardin. Would you excuse us? We'll make a full report at interrogation. I'll be there. Go ahead. Seacliff 88, any call from Cobra Red Leader? Seacliff 88 to Haystack. Negative. No call from Cobra Red Leader. Haystack to Seacliff 88. Thank you and out. Five fighter... Mayday. Mayday. Have to ditch. Fricktop blue two here. Going down near midchannel. Give me a fix. 1, 2, 3... Five fighter bomber. Yes, sir. Say, little friend, let a bomber pass! You call that junk heap a bomber? That's Ed! Your tail's drooping, isn't it, peashooter? Top cylinder's shot off. I'm running on an eggbeater. We thought you were dragging your feet. Bandits! Hey, you, Thunderbolt! Germans 5:00 high. See 'em? I see them. Get out! Run! I haven't got enough juice. Get under our wing. We'll try and cover you. Right. Pretty close quarters. Stick out your hand to turn. O.K. Scratch one! Cannon shell on the wing! You all right, Thunderbolt? Yeah, but it's letting the sun in on me. You can come up for air, Thunderbolt. The third one's running to tell Adolf. Thanks for the umbrella. Glad we could return the favor. You guys have helped us plenty. Haystack calling Hardin. Haystack calling Hardin. Who's that... Stu? You character! Come on home. I'm in no condition to go to London. Here he comes. Crash truck, fire truck standing by. Anything else you need? Over. Landing gear jammed. Bring me a wheelbarrow. Let's get out there. Let me talk to him. Easy, Ed. Easy. Go ahead! Boy, did we sweat you out! You're lucky. You're telling me! Let's see you fly it out. Get in. We'll go. Not me. That ship's a wreck. Have the taxpayers get me another. Sure, sure, I understand. Get these directives off my desk. Four days to install radio equipment? Take a memo. What will I say? Tell them to do it faster. Here's another... Cutting our requisition on gun cameras in half. From now on, order twice as many as we need. I won't have the Air Depot tell me how to run things. Who the blazes is Sergeant Kinsey? I don't know, sir, but there's been a stream of young ladies here from Randall, Kentborough, Stratford, and Dorset, all complaining about a Sergeant Kinsey. He must be quite a Don Juan. It can't be any of our men. They don't get passes to get around that much. See that I'm not bothered with this Kinsey again. Yes, sir. General Gilbert's here, sir. Send him in. Ah, hello, Mel. Sit down. Have a cigar. No, thank you, sir. Your wing had it hot today. 14 lost, 9 washouts, 20 major repairs. When fatso Goering puts up three groups to protect the target, that means our bombers are hitting them where they're tender. What's the trouble? How did you know? When there isn't any, you take a cigar. It's a thing I hate to request... The court-martial of a fighter pilot, Major Hardin. On what charge? Repeated violation of combat orders in the face of the enemy. This is difficult. Next to Brickley, he has the highest score of planes in the command, and he's one of your boys... That's got nothing to do with it. I didn't mean to imply favoritism. What's he done this time? The same as before... Refuse to stay with the bombers. In fairness, he went down to the deck trying to save one of his men, but afterwards, he didn't rejoin his squadron. He kept on after the enemy plane. Did he get him? He got three... Two in the air, one on the ground. By strafing the field, he subjected his plane to flak... A cylinder shot off. He had to wash out his plane. It's lucky he wasn't lost. That gives him, let me see... 16 victories. Makes a court-martial kind of tough. It's because of that, sir. He's a top ace. The replacements see him as an idol and follow his example. They must be taught in battle the vital necessity of their assigned duties, to respect the tactical judgment of the higher command. He's violating your own orders, sir! Hmm. Has the combat film on the 17th come up yet? Put Major Hardin's on. Come on, Mel. You ready? Yes, sir. Shoot. Mel, it seems to me that you've lost sight of one thing. Hardin was with the Flying Tigers in China before he joined the Eagle squadron with Hamilton, Brickley, and Chappell. In China, it was every man on his own and every Jap plane a target, regardless. My own personal feelings after seeing that film would be to recommend him for another cluster on his D.F.C. If you did that, it would be a reward for violating orders. Yes, you're right. By all the rules, I ought to court-martial him. The request is withdrawn, sir. Good. Good. But you were quite right in making it. Colonel Brickley speaking. Your replacements didn't arrive until 2100. I won't bring men back from missions where they've seen friends killed and make them eat dinner looking at empty chairs. Have them here at 1800! The major was very busy. That chair is a hard seat. A parachute pack is softer. I put you on the spot with Gilbert today. Forget it. To you, all Germans have slant eyes. I'd like to be there with you, but the order is stay with the bombers. Gilbert's slogans. "Escort over target will retain auxiliary gas tanks even if attacked." That one, too. You've refused to use our friendship with Mike McCready and go over Gilbert's head. How long will you let him hogtie us? We got enough groups to protect the bombers and paste Goering's boys before they get off the ground. Gilbert doesn't think so. Gilbert isn't C.G. McCready is. Gilbert's uncle is on air staff. You won't do it. You're an army officer plus a gentleman. I'm a China tramp. I'm going to. No, you won't. That's an order. Yes, sir. It'll come in time. When we're flying rocking chairs. Oh, they'll feel good. A drink would feel better. Let's make it two. If I was flying, we'd have had twice as many. Keep busy, Wilbur. Move around. One time I was stationed in Hollywood. What a town that is! One dame called for me every Saturday. Did she have a car? Did you ever have a chauffeur open the door for you? Did you ever have a lovely blonde covered with perfume entice you into a $14,000 limousine? Who do you think I go with, hitchhikers? Get a load of that captain... Always talking about women. If I had an airplane, I'd have dames all over the continent, but I operate in a jeep. Makes it tough. Come on, Dolan. Get 'em up. Hiya, Tennessee. How are the boys taking it? Some of them are feeling mighty low. A crap game usually helps... Takes their minds off it. Fellas, get out the dice. I got $400. Where's Stu? Upstairs. Let's go get him. You'd rather shoot crap than talk about women? Let's root him out. Speaking of dames, there was a little girl... If he doesn't stop talking about women, he'll wind up married to one. They're starting a game downstairs with two dirty cubes called dice. Bust out your flying pay! You go play. I'm staying with Ann. Why would she stay with you? Let me get my luck on. You better come barefoot. These are the good-luck boots of all time. You should have seen them in that London store... A bombed-out pile of rubble, gutted by fire, windows smashed. Ya da da... They were the only thing left... Immaculate, not even singed, not one speck of dirt! Did he tell it the same? Last time, he put the dirt first. 40 more. You're covered. 60 more. Yellow warning. Yellow warning. All personnel, prepare to take cover. Sic 'em, raf! Big old nasty 7! You better hold out some money for cigarettes. I feel lucky tonight. 200! I got you. Watch for those 11 freckles! Four's his point! Make a come bet. You never made four yet. All that says he doesn't. What's that for? As long as you're betting leather... Aw... Come on! Let daddy make his point! Red warning. Red warning. All personnel, take immediate cover. Looking for that great big four! Hey, fellas, where's that dough? I made it... The hard way! Hiya, Wilbur. Hello, sarge. Any calls? Lady Woodbine called. She said she'd meet you tonight at the same place. On the bridge. If it's raining, under the bridge. Gas up the jeep and throw my white tie in the back. Wilbur, I'm a little short. You got any money? All I've got is a dollar. You better write home for some dough. Yes, I think I'd better. Let one out, will you? Yes, sir. Dolan, Colonel Brickley wants to see you. Yes, sir. Yes, sir? I have a memo here from fighter command. There's a sergeant been spending a lot of time in the towns of Randall, Stratford, Kentborough, and Dorset entertaining ladies, and not by playing cricket. When General McCready finds him, he'll have him hung... twice. Can you describe him? We know he's a sergeant. His name's Kinsey. Must be in the infantry. Our men haven't had any passes off the base. And nobody's going to get off the base. Post that. Double restrictions. Fog's lifting. Is that from Ann? She sends her love. She saw your father. I'll bet the old man talked her ear off. You told her you'd be coming home soon? Yeah. Four more missions on this tour. Only one more, if this lifts today. She knows you've signed up for another one? She never tried to talk me out of it. You got a good girl. If only Brickley didn't have that crazy rule against marriage. As long as he's in command, we'll have to stick with it. Mission's been scrubbed. Fan mail? This one, gentlemen, is from a young lady in Texas... Blonde hair, big blue eyes, and an oil well in her back yard that pumps out money. Probably begging for my hand in marriage. Don't you know any poor women? I avoid them. A teletype came from General McCready ordering Brickley to headquarters. Smells like Gilbert. Brick just left. I have a message, sir. "New fighter group 604 and 605 "will be assigned to escort duty with 10th Bomber Wing when fully operational." Signed, "Curran." Oh, hello, Brick. Have a cigar. Oh, you don't smoke. Brick, we don't see enough of each other. I've been pretty busy. Yeah. You've been flying missions, Brick. What do you think of the combat policy? I'll make the question official. I respect General Gilbert. He's a perfect combat flyer. His ideas were O.K. A year ago when we didn't have enough planes, but he's out of date on two counts since the last five groups became operational. Belly tanks? The target escort having to hold on to them. Staff requires full flying time over target. We get jumped on the way. Our planes can't beat the Germans with tanks. The boys that find that out haven't survived. The second those fighters jump us, we should drop those tanks and knock them out of the air. They won't be around tomorrow to give us trouble. And, uh... what else? We've enough groups to send experienced ones in ahead of each mission. Smash up the airfields, pin them down. Yeah, uh... including your own group? Yes, sir. That's a hard nut to crack, Brick. Statistics show that our losses are four times greater in low-altitude operations... Flak, machine guns, rifles, pistols. They even throw pots and pans. The objective is to get the most bombers over the target free of attack. If you believed in it, you could persuade staff. It seems a long time ago since you fellas came to me from the Eagle squadron. It's been a lot of flying time. Brick, can you stand a shock? I've held off as long as I could. I want you to give up your group. You're my best man. I wanted to make you a brigadier a year ago, but your heart was set on flying. Take over a new group... The 604th. Make that a crack outfit, too. I was afraid it was a desk job. You'd be no good behind a desk... Losing weight, fighting ulcers, fighting the Air Depot. I know what your group means to you, and I'm not going to pull rank. Will you do it? If you want it that way, yes. Good. Now, who do you recommend to replace you? Ed Hardin. Hardin? Ah, I don't know. Hardin's a lone wolf... Bad record with violating orders. He's a great fighter, but he's not cut out for organization. He's never had responsibility. You know how I feel about my group. He's the best man to see it through the tough spots. You've respected my judgment of men in the past, general. Kid, if you want it that way, his orders will come through this afternoon. Thanks, Mike. I beg your pardon, sir. "General." Great Scott, my pill! What are you doing up so late? Waiting for you. The colonel sent me on a mission. There's a guy waiting for you. Probably the girl's father! Harry. Here I am, governor. How many you got? Half a dozen, about 3 years old. You want the soap or the cigarettes? I'll take the cigarettes. You'd better take the soap. Get lost. At ease, Wilbur. Any calls? Victoria called... The barmaid from Surrey. I told her you were wounded. You're practically a sergeant. Give me a hand. This batch ought to last me a week. Oh, they're nice. Where's the other one? There it is. I'll save this one for Saturday. Aren't you afraid you'll get caught? By who? The officers? When the war is over, they'll be working for me, and I got a job for you. Thank you! No salary. I'll give you part of the business. Oh, thanks. They make an awful lot of noise when they're fighting. Or maybe they're hungry. Yeah. I got this money clip from a dame in Chicago. Now it's full of franc notes. Why carry French dough? In case I get knocked down. He's been carrying the address of some French dancer. The most beautiful French acrobatic dancer at the Folies Bergere. She does a dance of rippling muscles. If I meet her, you guys could have all the women I ever told you about. This dame probably doesn't exist, either. Jack Cotter at the 85th was dying when he told me. He got so excited, he got well again, but I already had her address. What was that address? I'm no stool pigeon. I think I'll go show Millie the village. Dolan must be drinking alcohol out of the compasses again. He's saying Brickley's being transferred. It's true. Colonel Brickley wants to see you in his office, Ed. This is no good, Brick. We've been playing ostrich. Lightning had to strike sometime. Who swung it. Gilbert? No. McCready wants me to break in the 604th. That makes army sense... Wreck the highest-scoring outfit he's got. Who else can they get? You, colonel. He's out of his mind. I recommended you. I thought you knew me better. There's Hamilton and Duke. I don't tick that way. I can run a squadron, not 48 planes in a rat race. You could. You never wanted to. A cute kid lieutenant in Honolulu, you wanted to be a rover boy. Threw up your commission and went to China. Play it high, wide, and handsome. Voluntary missions... Plaster them. Think of nobody but yourself. We used to do that in the Eagle squadron, but you've made this war your three-ring circus. I've taken the rap. Now pay me back. This is my outfit. Give every man a chance to survive... Keep them on their toes, strict rules, split-second timing. Will you do it, or will you keep flying for yourself? Or can't you take it? I'll take it. Thanks. "Cute kid lieutenant." Oh, you... Where's your bag? She's in Peoria. He kissed her good-bye. It isn't every day we get rid of a colonel. We want his office! Ten hut! At ease, men. Any man I ever chewed out while I was C.O. of this outfit, stand up. Ha ha ha! I'm sorry. Good-bye and good luck. Pull the rip cord! Steady on your feet, Ed. You never saw when I wasn't, and don't get married! Transfer from the group first! Take him away, corporal. Get them on straight. Colonel Hardin's going to be proud of those. I keep pricking my finger. That's practice for sewing on your own stripes, and you will soon because I'm punching for you. Don't eat the coat. I wasn't going to. Listen, get busy. Move around. Don't let him catch you sitting down all the time. Yes, sir. At ease. Medical report. A-4 on those major repairs. Here's your blouse, sir. Just finished sewing on the leaves. Kept sticking my finger. I'll get you a pretty Red Cross nurse. I'd rather have a thimble. I'd do anything for you. Find Sergeant Kinsey. I'm getting complaints from headquarters. He gets around. He must be a paratrooper. Well, find him, sergeant. Anything else, major? Colonel, Dolan. You haven't got the coat on. Thanks, sergeant. You're welcome, colonel. Here's a letter confirming your command. This was sent before Brick asked me. He knew he could count on you. Here's a reminder to write letters of condolence. Brickley always write those himself? Always. He never could remember how to spell "courageously." I won't fit this desk. Oh, you will, colonel. Keep them on their toes, strict rules, split-second timing. Tomorrow's mission, colonel. 2000 weather reports clearing. Berlin. First strike on Berlin. We escort over target. Goering won't have his Abbeville boys up for this. Still no permission to drop tanks. At least we'll establish a new high in losses. When I put the coat on him, he was happy, so I told him, "Wilbur did all the sewing." Then I put the pressure on him for your stripes. Gee! Do you really think I'll get it? You stick with me, you know you'll get it. Where's that no-marriage sign? It was there this morning. It was there this afternoon. Who took it? Captain Hamilton... Tonight. And when I return, you'll find me a changed man... A man you will admire, able to make a four at the flip of the wrist to support my lovely bride! We've been waiting for you. To the group commander... Our beautiful big wheel. Hooray! Hooray! Now we can really celebrate. One more mission, then home to be married. You'll still be best man, by proxy. To Mrs. Hamilton. Sorry I can't drink to that. Ha ha! Always a guy for a gag. This is no gag. You don't mean that crazy idea of Brick's. We followed it while he was here, but you're in command. It isn't crazy. His rules aimed to save lives. The outfit is stuck with it? We're also stuck with the highest score in the group. Brick wanted one kind of man that thought flying, lived for nothing but flying. He said that when a man has a wife and children, he finds he can't gamble his life with split-second aggressiveness. That can make the difference... one less pilot. You've broken plenty of rules. You're alive. I've broken General Gilbert's orders but never one of Brickley's. You're not Brick. It's not your rule. He asked me to take his place, to see this outfit through. I'm going to. Corporal, take that sign back to the hut. Yes, sir. "Transfer from this group first." I can do better. I can get a training job in the States with a home and wife and kids. Yes, you can, Stu. Many men have gone home after one tour. You've put in two. Until you make that decision official, you'll move to squadron commander. I'll make that official now. Then fly your regular position for your last mission as my wing man. Captain Chappell, after tomorrow's mission, you'll be squadron commander. Atkins, take Chappell's place as flight leader. You may want to start logging sack time. Weather reports clearing. Tomorrow's mission will be target cover on the first bombing of Berlin. Berlin! Yow! Wilbur. Hey, Wilbur. What's the matter? Throw them a bloater and shut them up. Oh, the cats? We'll run out of fishies. That's better than running out of cats. Let one out first thing in the morning. I got to be in Dorset. I'm in trouble with Sybil's mother. She's hard of hearing and kept tuning in on our conversation, so I stole her hearing aid. There's a beef going on at the house. I'll get it back in the morning. Say something. See if I can hear. What can I say? Anything. Good night. She didn't hear anything with this. All pilots, attention. Report to briefing room. Report to briefing room. All pilots, attention. Report to briefing room. All pilots, attention. Report to briefing room. Report to briefing room. What are you doing? If I have to get up this early, ain't no birds going to be sleeping. Attention! As you were. Today's job is to fly target support over Berlin. They're making a test strike with 30 B-17s. When you fly over the flak emplacements on the Dutch coast, have your squadron at 25,000 feet, Harris. I'll be at 24. Ward, you'll be at 23. We'll fly a "V" by squadrons, low squadron, up sun. Takeoff time, 0900. Dutch coast south of Breskens, 1010. Rendezvous with the heavies at Belzig, 1115. Break escort, 1200. Major? We've learned that Goering's moved three groups of Abbeville boys to the Spandau and the Charlottenburg fields. They'll think this strike's on Magdeburg until you make the rendezvous turn. Then expect them to put up everything they have. Call. General McCready, sir. The logical area of interception will be here, from the south... Colonel Hardin speaking. Your first one in command. Good luck. Thank you. I didn't call for that. I've got a favor to ask. Brick talked about dropping those belly tanks but couldn't prove it. Now we've got to. I can't. Staff says it's not policy. We'd make it policy if you'd give us a fighting chance. Putting me on the spot? I got to take those men to Berlin. They've never done it. They'll be attacked. If they can't drop those tanks, half of them will never get there. It's not only staff. I'll have Bomber Command on my neck. I remember when you had a tough neck, Mike. All right, Ed. One mission. I'll cut a tape on it, but you'd better find some Germans. I'll get a fat one for you, sir, and thank you. Good luck. Hold it. Hold it. General McCready just told me he's sending through an order. If we're attacked on this mission, we're to drop tanks. He wished us good luck. That's it. In nomine patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti. Amen. O Almighty God, the Supreme Governor of all things, whose power no creature can resist. Amen. [Speaking hebrew] Looks like I got the hex on me. Sergeant Dolan! What's that doing here? Here's your friend. We told you to get rid of it. I took him 40 miles away and dropped him at a fish store. Take it 50 miles, but get it off this field. Take it to London. Yes, sir! Yes, sir. What are we waiting for? This is Yardstick. We using runway 26? Haystack to Yardstick. Takeoff runway 2-6. Wind from the west, 10 degrees. Taxi out when ready. Over and out. Hold this till I get back. When do the fighters and bombers rendezvous? Third group to position between hannover and magdeburg. Third fighter group 10 minutes from rendezvous. Hardin checking R.T. Stu? Hamilton. Roger. Chappell. 1, 2, 3, 4. This is Hardin. German fighters, 2:00 high. Drop belly tanks if they jump us. [Speaking German] If we could see their kissers now. Drop tanks. [Speaking German] Hold it, Fritzie. Papa's got something for you. That's it. Heavy, isn't it? Compliments of Captain Hamilton. Let's get 'em! Right in the gas tanks! Mein gott! Das schwein! Hey, fellas, I got me one! Weaver, look out! 6:00! He's bouncing you! Get him off my tail, somebody! Du schwein! Weaver, hit the silk! I'm bailing out. Chappell, take over. I wish I had that Paris blonde's address. Paulette. 29 Rue de Rivoli. Happy landing. Ed! This is Hamilton. I'm following him down. They're gunning him! Blue leader, I'm going down. Take over. Want to play rough, eh? Burn, you crumb! Burn! [Speaking German] [Speaking German] [Shouting in German] Mach schnell! Come on! I thought you wanted to get home! I do! [Shouting in German] Schnell! Comfy, darling? You ought to go on a diet. This will be a rough takeoff. I hope Dolan can find that cat. I'd like to express my gratitude. First returning groups now on Baker Three, sir. Ha! Open the channel! General. Thank you. "Third fighter group... "Berlin mission... 39 enemy planes destroyed. Only one lost." New record. Staff will be happy. Have a copy framed and sent to Colonel Brickley. Call it, "when our fighters dropped their tanks." No, better still, call it, "Brickley's tactics." He'll like that. Hardin said they'd mop up. Colonel Hardin seems to be reforming. Reformed? Yeah, he's reformed. Now it's his other two dizzy renegades, Hamilton and Chappell. I'm glad they saved him, though. I need that man. Duncan, those boys are giving the Air Force some new fighter tactics. Belly tanks! Soon, you'll need smaller numbers. Or a bigger blackboard, or the Germans will need more planes! Well, look who's back again! Hooray! Hooray! Welcome home! Dolan, you're a genius! Lucky cat! Park this cat on the parachutes every morning. How did you find it? I thought, "Where would a black cat go?" I went there. You took it off the field? It's the same one? Smell him. Who says black cats aren't lucky? A new record, the colonel rescued, and what did we find out? Where does Paulette live? 29 Rue de Rivoli! You shouldn't have told Hardin over the R.T. He's got to get to Paris to call her. When he does, I'll answer! Here comes the blushing bridegroom! My boy! You ran the show great today, Tennessee. Boys got hot without those tanks. I felt lost without you, though. From headquarters, sir. Attention! At ease. A message from headquarters. "Effective immediately, group commanders "will caution pilots of the obvious danger "of attempting to rescue personnel "by landings on the continent. "This message should not minimize "Captain Hamilton's gallantry in his rescue. "Pilots must be impressed with the dangers involved "and the overwhelming odds against success. "The probability of the loss "of two aircraft and pilots rather than one will be brought forcibly to each pilot's attention." Signed, "Gilbert, Wing Commander." I thought you'd rate a D.F.C. For your last mission. Thanks. At least I had the pleasure of breaking Gilbert's pet rule once. So long, Duke. Have fun. Ed. I'll walk out with you. So long, Stu. See you, Stu. Thanks again for the ride today. O.K. I'm sorry we couldn't work this out. How can we, Stu? I'm a stubborn guy. That makes two of us. Give my best to Ann. Any message for your father? Yeah. Tell him I'm just as tough on my men as Brickley was. I'll tell him one of them had enough tours of Europe and wanted to get married. See you in the States. It's a deal, Stu. Let's go. Our loss is 8... Captains Gallagher and Kover, Lieutenants Miller, Dorr, Perry... Rujesky, Karlen, and Musetti. Total for March... 147 enemy planes destroyed. Eight probables, 43 damaged. The group's made a fine record. Two more, you'll be top-scoring ace. I'm looking forward to that. Sanford, I'm going to ask you to write these letters to the boys' parents. I find I'm not Brickley. Good night. Good night, colonel. Stay as sweet as you are. These shows are getting rugged. Funny how you can miss one crummy pair of boots. Yeah. Ah, the lucky dog. What it must feel like being home. Wake up with a lovely wife, nothing to do but relax. I'd be a fat slob in a week. Colonel, sir. Come on in. I'm Lieutenant Kirk. A replacement from OTU. You know Captain Chappell and Lieutenant Atkins? Captain. Lieutenant. Would you answer a question, sir? About the girl you left behind? No, about flying. You'd better ask the colonel. Sit down. Thank you. When you're trying for a deflection shot, you don't watch the enemy plane. What you watch? I watch his exhaust for smoke. Cutting his engine telegraphs his next move. Then I put on my brakes. If you do overshoot, don't be brave. Look for an empty hunk of sky. Yes, sir. Nervous about tomorrow? I'm scared. We all get it every day. Maybe I'll get used to it. Tomorrow, you'll fly my wing. A wing man protects his partner. You'll do better than you think. That's an order. Yes, sir. Get some sack time. Thank you. Good night. Were you ever that young? I was born an old man. There's your new ship, sir. Remind me to thank the taxpayers. What's he doing? He was out here before sunup. He's checked everything but the paint job. Like a kid with a new toy. He'll be all right. Hurry up. You're holding up the war. Thanks for everything if I don't come back. If? This outfit don't think that way. I'll be waiting to put lots of swastikas on when you get back. There might be a Jerry with the same idea. Forget it! I've been thinking over a new fighter tactic, a low-level mission. Go in ahead of the bombers and plaster the airfields. Get the Jerry planes on the ground. Keep them from attacking our bomber formations. I talked it over with Ed, and he suggested... Ed? You mean Colonel Hardin? Ed felt it would be a tactical advantage to go down on the deck, catch them napping. You know my feeling about low-level missions. We have higher losses and fewer fighters for bomber support. We've got more planes now. We should take advantage of tactical surprise. They won't expect a wave of fighters ahead of the bombers. I would like to prepare some facts and figures to substantiate my opinion on this type of operation. No, no, no. This war is moving too fast. We've got to listen to the new tactics of our younger officers. Hardin is very keen about this. I'm 99% sold on it myself. I'll think the matter over and let you know. That's all, Gil. Thanks. Haystack to Yardstick. Yardstick to Haystack. Go ahead. Use runway three. Wind velocity, 10 miles. Roger. Well! Looks like they got a piece of your tail. Yes, they did, sir. They shot Lieutenant Fox's wing off. I saw you knock down that 109, Shorty. You nailed him beautifully. I think I'm going to be sick. Sarge, give him a blast of oxygen. You guys give him a hand. He's got a Messerschmitt that's confirmed by me. Put it on there. Yes, sir. Yep. It's all yours. Four more, you'll be an ace. Can't they make it bigger? 17 more, you'll be even with Colonel Hardin. I'm going to be sick again. Some more oxygen? Yes, sir. Shorty, better drink to your victory. I'd like root beer. A little warm beer won't hurt you. We'll make a man out of you yet. Come on around here, men. This is something we've waited a long time to hear. You noticed those new German squadron markings today. Our target and withdrawal escorts ran into the rest of them, plus the old ones. 202 over target, 244 on withdrawal. We lost 59 bombers. Intelligence reports new German fighter concentrations at Flagerstadt and Grisha airfields outside Berlin. Tomorrow morning, we're going in at 30,000 feet an hour ahead of those bombers and giving the fields a good going-over. The 18,000-foot rule is off. Now we can go down and see whether they're blondes or brunettes! Let's give it to him! Oh, General Gilbert Oh, General Gilbert We're leaving you high and dry to hit the deck Attention! General Gilbert's in the pan. Such disrespect! Honeymoon too tough? He saw his mother-in-law. Where did you go? Niagara Falls. You take your wife? Stu! Did you see my old man? You owe him 80 bucks. What brings you back? That training school. That's not hard to take. The honeymoon is over. I never put through those transfer papers. I got back just in time. Got room for me in that rat race tomorrow? We'll need every old hand we've got. How about a drink? Let's drink to tomorrow! Ah, the boots. Things look normal. Sack it up. We're cutting grass tomorrow. Good night, fellows. Good night. Thanks for saving it until we got up here. You married, Stu? Yeah. Aren't you going to congratulate me? Yes, I do. You both deserve happiness. We have it. But you signed up for another tour. Yeah. She... she understood. I couldn't stay out. Tomorrow, I need your written request for transfer to another group. You wouldn't make me go through that. You left me no choice. I could have lied to you. You're not the type. I left my wife, my marriage, a chance for a home. Came back. Isn't that proof of my loyalty? There are over 100 loyal men in this group. But I told you... If Brick was still in command, would you have done this to him? O.K., Ed. I'll have it on your desk in the morning. Thanks. What about tomorrow's mission? Will you give me that break? I can't do it. I've flown your wing a lot of years. Been waiting a long time for this order to hit the deck. It isn't much to ask. All right, Stu. Let's take this out on the Germans. I got some shoe-shining to do. [Speaking German] All right, Stu. You wanted it. I'm right behind you. Time for the jackpot. Good luck. [Shouting in German] Berlin! Berlin! Flagerstadt! Grisha! There they are, like sitting ducks. [Man shouting in German] Stu! That flak tower... Let's get it. Wow! Pardon me, boys. Here comes the Chattanooga Choo-Choo. I've been working on the railroad [Speaking German] Bandits! [Speaking German] [Speaking German] Stu! Bail out, Stu! Canopy's jammed. Get your back on it. No dice, Ed. You and Brick were right. I thought about Ann. Sorry to keep you waiting. I had expected to find you in your office. But then, there were several things I had expected of you. What was that, sir? I had expected that you knew enough of army procedure. Everything presented to the higher echelon must go through channels. I'm well aware of that, general. You didn't seem to be when you went to General McCready about dropping belly tanks. There was no time, sir. I'll remind you that I am your immediate superior in this fighter wing. In the future, everything you say to headquarters will be sent through me. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. You've been very successful in furthering your own ideas. First, the dropping of the belly tanks, and now, low-level missions. That order came from staff, sir. Yesterday, following out your tactics, you became the top-ranking ace. 22 victories. Very commendable. But it also caused the death of Captain Hamilton. Now perhaps you can understand why I've always opposed low-level missions. The loss ratio is always four times higher. "Stay with the bombers." "Keep the belly tanks." Stupid slogans made up while you were flying your desks. You ought to be up there, have someone banging at your tail. How would your rules hold? You'd leave the bombers and drop the tanks. Maybe you'd get some sense through your paperwork heads. We're up to here with channels and red tape! Get out of here! Are you aware of what you're saying? Get out. You're a case of combat fatigue, Hardin. What about those stripes? You'll get them. You promised them for my birthday. That's when you'll get them. But my birthday was last week. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you write it down? Sir, I know when it is. Keep me posted on the next one. Go clean up the bar. I've got to see General McCready. You look worried, sir. There's trouble. General Gilbert? I really did it this time. Wish me luck, Dolan. Sergeant! Your picture is in the magazine. Everyone is talking about it. I got scrapbooks loaded with these things. I'll take this one, though. Where is Sweeney? He's in intelligence interviewing women. That's my racket. I'll give him a hand. I'm sorry about Hamilton's death. I'll miss him, too, almost as much as you. I know, sir. I can't lose any more of you. Big things are coming up. I need old hands here at headquarters, the old gang from the Eagle squadron. Brick's reporting tomorrow. I want you to come up with him. Did General Gilbert put me on report? Combat fatigue? No. He told me about it, said he was sorry. He said he'd been wrong. But you believe it. No. I've begun to think that my tactics are wrong. I've always hated pulling men out of the sky and putting them behind desks. But it's what I should have done. Hamilton's death proved that to me. When can you report? I'd like to finish this tour. How many more missions? You let Hamilton go just one more. I'd have asked for the same thing. I am now. I've watched those bomber concentrations over Normandy the last few weeks. I've flown a long time waiting for D-Day. I want to do some paying off for Stu. I could order you to report to headquarters. I suppose you'd obey orders. Yes, sir, but these oak leaves are temporary. I request to be reduced to my permanent rank of captain so I could keep on flying. All right, Ed. Go on back to your group. Thank you, sir. But when your tour is over, you report here! Yes, sir. What's going on out there? Quiet! Quiet, please! What in blazes is going on here? Look at this picture. That is Sergeant Kinsey. Quiet, please! So you are Sergeant Kinsey, eh? Ladies, I promise this man will be punished. What about my daughter's cat? I didn't take Sybil's cat. What? I didn't take Sybil's cat. Over. Roger. Roger? He was at our house, too. Quiet, please, ladies. Kinsey, consider yourself under arrest. Take this character out of here. It was the best cat we ever had. Sometimes I wish I was a sergeant. If I was a general, this wouldn't have happened. Black cats are always bad luck. No. Once, riding with my mother-in-law, a black cat ran in front of the car. I hit the brakes... Boing! She hasn't talked to me since. That's good luck. This way, sir. Am I getting out, sir? In time, I imagine you will. We were cleaning up your room and found these. I think you've been dealing in the black market. Enjoy them, Dolan. Major, General McCready is on the phone. I came to thank you, Dolan. You said I'd get it. I got it. It's no good. The cat racket is dead. Sergeant. Yes, sir. Take one of those cats to Sybil's mother. Yes, sir. Soldier, hand me a tame one. Yes, sir. You don't have to salute me when you're in jail. Get busy. Keep moving around. Don't let them catch you standing still. Come on, pussy. We're going to town. My congressman will hear about this. Is this it? I hope so. My flying time is running out. Get everybody into the briefing room. Yes, sir. All leave is canceled. All pilots on leave are recalled at once. All personnel will wear sidearms. All guards doubled. No one leaves or enters the field. There is to be no communication with the outside. Strict radio silence will be maintained. All planes will be fully armed with .50 caliber and rockets. "A" squadron will be armed with napalm bombs, "B" squadron with fragmentative 260s, "C" squadron, first section, with frag 500s, second section, with phosphorus 500s. All planes will be ready for takeoff at 0300 tomorrow. Is this the big show? Could be. Let's go. "Dear Ann, "your letter has given me the courage to write about Stu. "I followed him down. "The last thing he said on the R.T. Was that he was thinking of you." Your move. Jacobs, don't flip your lid. Don't tell me he's going with us. We're going to need everything we've got in the air. Black Leader, Black Leader. Hello, Black Leader. It works. No word. Clear as a bell. We used to hull corn at night back in Tennessee. I didn't hull corn, but it was a night just like this. Southeast, southeast. Shallow's here. Naval bombardment ranging beachhead now. Division 14, Division 14. Landing craft still 1/4 mile off Omaha... Radio silence broken at 0611. They're hitting the beaches. It's the invasion. D-Day, sir. No Fritzes up here today. Take a look. The invasion's really on. Look at that beach. Looks like Coney Island on Sunday. Cobra Leader, Cobra Leader. Beagle ground control calling. Cobra Leader to Beagle. Go ahead. We're on Omaha Beach. We'll control you from here. Attack Beauville. The village Beauville. L-24 your map. Infantry in houses. Tiger tanks. Two block houses above village to east. Try to knock them out. Holding up our troops at the head of this valley. Cobra Leader. L-24 on block houses. Roger. [Speaking German] Beagle to Cobra Leader. Correction, correction. Take sector 17 10 miles behind coastline. Patrol St. Clair and Alencon road. Cobra leader to Beagle. You're a different voice. The other operator was wounded. I have taken over. What do they call the Brooklyn Dodgers? What? I don't understand you. I'll say you don't. Hey, Duke! They ought to know about Ebbets Field. Yeah. Village ahead. Arm your bombs. Plaster it. Block houses dead ahead. Right behind you, Ed. Double bull's-eye! Not bad bombing, huh? Let's get those Tiger Tanks on the road. Where are you going, junior? Cobra Leader to Beagle, Cobra Leader to Beagle. Plug it in, sergeant. O.K., Cobra. You did it. A hot job, baby. Our troops are moving up. Fly sector five now, 1-3 miles behind beach. Attack all reinforcements they're bringing up... Railroads, troops, road convoy. Sector five, 1-3 miles. Roger. Cobra Leader to squadrons. Select your targets, and let's go. I see something hidden in those trees, and it's no picnic ground. A man could get his tail burned. Hey, fellows. A gas station! Fill 'er up! By the rocket's red glare Have one on me! Don't report for work tomorrow. Hey, this flak is getting rough. Colonel Hardin! Cobra Leader! Colonel Hardin! He's going down. Flak hit him. Ed! Ed! Ed, answer! It was flak. No German plane would get him. You didn't see him crash. No. I never got another look. Tennessee? None of us. Was his plane spinning? No, sir. Just heading down. Slow spiral. He's alive. I gave him Paulette's address in Paris... 29 Rue de Rivoli. He'll get there. Sir, your temporary orders putting you in command of the group. And these are my orders. Fly low, strike hard, and blast a hole for those ground boys to get through. I got to be in Paris before Hardin. What are we waiting for? And so the brilliant page of history was written, thanks to the Mike McCreadys, to the inspiration of the Bill Brickleys, to the laughter of the Duke Chappells, to the eagerness of the Shorty Kirks, to the youth of the Tennessee Atkins, to the loyalty of the Stuart Hamiltons, and to the courage and the daring of the Ed Hardins, who streaked across the skies to make possible the victory below.
