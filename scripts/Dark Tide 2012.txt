My father once told me... to be careful of the things... you love most in the world. Because if you're not careful, that very thing can also destroy you.   Okay. You ready? One, two, three. Rolling. The only way you can really learn about sharks... is to get out of the cage and actually swim with them. I look for a curious shark. That's one that's calm and just cruising. But if I notice... that the shark has got its pecs down, then that means that they don't want me invading their space. So, in that case, I try to swim below the shark... to obtain the power position. In order to swim with a shark, you have to think like a shark. That's why I make myself really small. Because the smaller I can make myself, the more sharks I can potentially attract to the area. - No, no. Wait. Hey, Tommy. - Yeah? Go to port side. I want you in the shot. I don't wanna steal Kate's fire. If I'm in the shot, everyone's gonna be checking out my ass. - Right. - The camera loves me. Yeah, that's 'cause they can't smell you. - I smell beautiful. Wanna smell? - Funky. No... Whoa, guys. Whoa. Whoa. - I'm rolling. - That's gross. Themba, what are you doing? Changing. No, you're not. We're about to go on a dive. I don't think so, my lovely. Well, who's gonna do my safety? Come on. I need you. You know I love you like a daughter, but I'm more good to you up here. Well, I need your eyes on my prize. His prize. Sure, sure, sure. Okay. You win. Women always win. Oh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. What are we doing here? I mean, come on. It's not only a movie. I try to do something about sharks. Come here, Kate, and do the scenes. Talk about sharks. Okay. All right. We digress. Okay. Ready? Okay. - Okay. Un... - So, deux, trois. Rolling. In order to really understand the psychology of the shark, you've got to get outside the cage, you've gotta get in the water, and you've gotta actually swim with them. But if you make one... Kate! Kate! - It's not funny at all. - I love you. - Okay. Come on. I'm just having fun. - No, that's not funny at all. - Shots. - Okay. Okay. As a free diver, I'm extremely vulnerable... when I go to the surface to breathe. That's why I have my safety man Themba. I'm the eyes in the back of Kate's head, and she's the eyes behind mine. I've done, what, 50 dives, and I only have - Look. See? - Oh, love bite. You thought he needed to floss his teeth. Hey. Incoming! Oh, my God. Look at that, look at that. Oh-ho! Check this guy out. - Oh, boy. Here he is. - Wow. Bring him in, Tommy. Bring him in. Okay. Okay. Whoa! It's a big male. What... Easy, guys. Hey, he's too aggressive. Hey, hey, hey. Careful. Oh, he got it. He got it. - Ohhh! - Easy, fella. Easy. Oh, no, no. We got a lively one. You're not going in the water with him. Honey, move over. Let me get you in the frame. Second shark coming in! It looks like a female. Ah, now, she's more like it. She's a big girl. This is more like it. - Come on. Here she comes. - Come on, baby. Come on. - Here she comes. - Beautiful. You gonna let me swim with you? - What do you think? - I think we got a player. I'm gonna go down and check things out. All right. Come on, Jeff. You ready? Hey, Themba, keep an eye out for that male. He looked like trouble, huh?   Kate! Themba's been hit! Get in the boat! Get in the boat! Where's Jeff? Jeff, get in the boat! Get in! What happened? What happened? Kate, what happened? Kate? Where's Jeff and Themba?   And now, I hand you over to Ron for the news. Thank you, Dirk. And coming up, breaking news. A 19-year-old surfer was fatally attacked by a great white shark off the shore earlier today. Witnesses say the shark attacked without warn... It's about 40 minutes out to Seal Island. And it's home to 74,000 Cape fur seals... and a wonderful bird sanctuary. You can see the Cape cormorant, the Bank cormorant, the... - Do you see sharks? - Oh, yes, yes. There are sharks out there. - You will be able to see the sharks. - Can we go on the water? Cage? - No, no. We don't do... - Take pictures? - We don't do shark diving. - Not on the water. If you're lucky, you'll be able to catch the whales. - We want the sharks. - No. We don't do that. Okay. - Thank you. - All right. Thanks. - Hi. - Hello. Oh. - Mmm. - What's happening, Zukie? The bad news, the good news, or the house blend? I wanna hear that we have as many customers as those guys. All right. Tell me. Okay. The bank called. They're gonna take your boat. No, they're not. I got a second mortgage. I'm just waiting on the bank to approve it. Well, now they're saying they can liquidate your assets. Oh, yeah? Really? I wanna see them try that. Get a lawyer. It has to be a good lawyer. You can't afford a bad one. Good point. Okay. - Good news. - Good news: We've got three for today. Yes! Got three tours. Whoo-hoo! No, no, no. Three people, one tour, and that's it for the rest of today. Okay. Well, house blend. - Jeff called. - Ah. Don't wanna know. He says you haven't returned any of his calls. It's been a year, honey. You've got to talk to him at some point. How about we do ourselves a favor and stick to English? Okay. What did he say? He says he wants to meet. He says it's urgent. Have you forgotten you two look cute together? - We look cute. - Look at you. He makes you laugh. You're laughing already. Yes. Come on. It won't do any harm. Okay. Okay. I'll call him. - Go. Shoo. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Bye-bye. - Welcome aboard the Volante.  Looks like we got good weather. It's only gonna be a 45-minute drive out to Seal Island, okay? - Okay. - Where you guys from? - London. - Ah, London. I see you got your camera. Gonna get some good pictures. - Thanks. - I'm gonna have you wear this... for your safety. - Welcome to Cape Town. - Thanks. Yeah. Tommy! To... Hey, guys. Remember me? Vaguely. Hold on tight. And we're off. Is this boat gonna make it? With the correct diesel. I'm sick enough as it is. Don't start moaning already. Gonna have it on again. What type of sharks do you think we'll see? 'Cause we've been learning about the tiger shark at school. - Take a look around. - Listen to her, will you? So, you see those two war ships up ahead? Well, they're here because Simon's Town is the main port of the South African Navy. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, did you hear that? - Do you wanna go and look at some? - No. I wanna see the sharks. Please yourself. Look, there's a whale. Tommy, slow it down. Come. Look. - Where? - Right there. See him? Oh, wow. - That's a southern right whale. - I've never seen one. Do you have any idea why they're called the right whale? Because they swim on the right? Well, they're the right whale because they're high in oil... and they're slow to swim. That traditionally makes them easy to catch. Oh. However, luckily for them, they're protected now and not so easy to catch. Oh. Listen. You hear that? What does that sound like? They don't sound like penguins. Listen. Sounds like your sweet mother on the loo. What did you say? - I said I can hear them. Can you? - What? Nothing. Those are the, uh, jackass penguins. - Oh. - Mom, she said "ass". Do the sharks eat the penguins? - It happens. - Oh, yeah? - They eat husbands? - Very funny. What you have here is the world famous Cape fur seals. This is the largest seal colony in the Cape. And if you look real closely, you just might see some little pups. We just had a gang of them born here recently. There's about 10,000 of these little guys... born here in the Cape every year. Sadly, most of them will never see their first birthday. There's loads! That's pretty. Look at it. Shall I get a picture? - You know what to click? - You got it. Sharks eat seals, right? Yep. They sure do. That's their favorite meal. So where are they? Oh, they're out there. Trust me. This is the largest feeding ground for sharks in the world. So even though we can't see them, they're out there. Hey, great tour, by the way, huh? - There you go. - Those seals are so cute, really. - Pays the bills. - Doesn't look like it. But you still look hot. Hey, Tommy. She looks hot or what? - Yeah. - See? - For her age. - Great. You're fired. So, you're still pissed at me? Come on. You miss me. I miss you. No need to play it cool. You seeing somebody? You mean, uh, lately? No, it's been about a year now. Right. How old is she? 19? Oh, man, this is bad news. Bad news. Aah. There's a lot of water in the bilge. You think it's the cutlass? I don't know, Kate. Could be the stuffing box. Could be a seacock is leaking, I think. Could be a what, Captain? Did you say "seacock"? - Why? - Say it again. I love your accent. What accent? I don't have an accent. Seacock. Seacock. - "Seacock". - Whatever. Anyway, You should take the boat out of the water and check it. That's what I think. Thank you. I missed you, man. Come here. Give me a hug. Forward. Forward. Yeah. Good. Come. How's my right hand? Away from the wall. Okay. I got it. Oh, yeah. Hey, I'm sorry. For what? For What I did. What'd you do? I don't know. What did I do? Well, if you don't know that, then there's no sense having this conversation. Well, you know, we all deal with shit in different ways. Yeah. I can see that. But you're really the best. Come on. Sea Tours? What's that about? You're not a tour guide. Oh, yeah. 'Cause you're doing something so much better, huh? No. But I remind you that we were supposed to make movies together about sharks. Remember? We were gonna be the first ones... to film them mating, calving. Looks like that didn't happen. Sorry you're so unhappy. - Because you are happy? - I am happy. No. No. You are angry. I'm not angry. That's... I'm not angry. You think I'm angry, but I'm not. You have no idea what's wrong with me. - That's the problem. - I'm sorry I can't read your mind. Why not? We're married. You should be able to. You walked out, not me. You wanted me to walk out. I wanted you to feel. I wanted you to care about me. I care. I care. That's the problem. And I always care! But after what happened to Themba, you became impossible to be around. It was easy for you just to get back out on the water. No, no, no. That's easy for you to feel sorry for yourself as you do. - "It's my fault. It's my fault". - It is my fault. - No! - Yes! If it wasn't for me, Themba would still be here. I know that's hard for you to understand, but it's true. Now, if that makes me impossible, I'm sorry. - Excuse me. - Whoa! I heard about the bank. They're gonna take the boat. Zukie, why don't you just sew your mouth shut? I just told the truth! I'm here to help. Push me again. I don't need your help. So stubborn. - I'm not stubborn. - Yes, you are. No, I'm not. I have a job offer. A lot of money. Enough to save the boat. Give me your phone. Where's my number? It's not in there. Erased it. Can I have my phone, please? Now it is. The guy is coming in tomorrow morning. Give me a call if you want to meet him. Or don't! Kate, are you gonna call him? Nope. He's right. You're miserable. You're making everyone around you miserable. Look in the mirror. See that? That is a horrible, miserable face. Yeah? You're gonna end up like one of those old women... with 45 cats, smelling like wee. - Just take the money. - First of all, that's disgusting. Second of all, why are you on his side? See this? A fuel bill. It needs to get paid. Yeah? See this? It needs to get paid, okay? As devastatingly handsome as I am, I can't keep going out on dates with girls saying, "Oh, we having champagne?" I say, "No, we're having tap water. Grab a straw". Stop. Be quiet, okay? - What? - Okay? All of that. All of that. Yeah. Uh-huh. You were a lot cooler when you were hanging outwith sharks. Kiss and make up. It's time. Like it's that easy, Zukie. You're being too hard on Jeff. Meet him halfway. Can you just stop, stop, stop, stop talking? - Be quiet. - We need the money, Kate. We need the money. - Take his offer. - No. - Why not? - Because. - Because? - Because. That's why. Because I said because. Because what? Zukie, because. Because you're still in hiding. My Themba lived and died by his choices. I've been married to that stubbornness for over 40 years. Believe me. And Themba loved his work. You know... He died on his terms. Not yours, and certainly not mine. Okay? Now go. Go see that boy and give him a big hug for me. Now you go. Bye, Zukie. Promise.     You have to get right up close, and you have to be able to feel them and touch them. They have to be able to trust you... in order to show you who they are... and teach you the things that you need to learn. And it's important to get out of the cage... Wow. That is amazing. Look at that. She's the only one in the world who does it. And lives to tell the tale. Hey. Hello. Katie Mathieson, William Brady. - Hello. - I am honored. What you do is quite extraordinary. If only my acquisitions managers had your nerve, then I'd be a rich man, and I could afford to get married again. - My son Luke. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - And you. - You have beautiful eyebrows, you know. Stunning. Oh, God. - Really. Stunning. - Mm-hmm. Okay. Sorry. I notice things like that. It's a compliment. Yeah. I like them, too. Ooh. Can we turn this off? Uh-huh. You don't like compliments. Hey, let's sit down. Luke, scoot. Come on. - Okay. - Please. Thank you. - Something to drink? - Yeah. Hot tea. Mm-hmm. Yes, sir? Anyone else? One hot tea, please. Thank you. What can I do for you? Okay. Let's cut to the chase. A woman after my own heart. We... want to dive with great white sharks. Good. I know a great place. There's lots of great cage operators... here in Cape Town, so... We want to swim with great white sharks... outside the cage. No, no, no. He wants to dive out of the cage. Yeah, that's right. Outside of the cage. How many people in the world have done that? You can count them on the fingers of one hand, am I right? That's an opportunity of a lifetime. See, my son here... he lives down here in Cape Town with his mum. She keeps him all wrapped up in bubble wrap. He's in the shark capital of the world, and he's never even seen one. Listen. Hey. Luke, Luke, I want this weekend to be memorable. Right. Well, you don't just... jump in the water with a great white. You just... Okay. You're gonna show us how to dive. Okay. I've spent ten years studying sharks. It's taken me that long to be able to get outside of a cage and swim. Well, I've got to be back in London... for business on Monday morning, so you're gonna have to give us the crash course. Don't worry. We're fast learners. Did you tell them they could get out of the cage? No, no, no. Wait a second. Jean Paul just here arranged for us... - to meet. - Jean Francois, sir. My name is Jean Francois. Call me Jeff, if you want. Forgive me. Jeff arranged for us to meet. But you're the real deal here, Kate. You're the reason I'm here. Anybody can point a camera, with respect, and take a picture, right, Luke? You, on the other hand, are the real deal. Nobody else in the world does what you do. You're the essential element here, Kate. I have done my research, and I'm willing to offer you if you will dive with me... so that I can get out of the cage... and swim with great white sharks. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing in the water... Dad, please. Not the spiel. Thank you. I'm Trionic certified. I have performed surgery on myself... ...in 50-foot seas in the Southern Ocean. It's a long story. I'll tell you about it later. I have also spent a week in a decompression chamber... after being stuck in the Blue Hole at Dahab, which was not my fault. He had James Cameron rescue him. Name-dropper. But, hey, I'm not ashamed of that. You want the best in the world alongside you... when you're pushing the envelope. That's why you're here. Swimming with sharks, for me... that is the ultimate. It's putting your courage on the line, right? First of all, it's not about courage, it's about trust. Well, I trust you to put me in the water with a great white shark. Okay, well, even if I would fathom this idea, it's the absolute wrong time of the year. It's mating season, and when sharks mate, they bite, and you do not want to be in the water when that happens. I don't wanna mate with a shark. I just wanna swim with one. I'm prepared to sign a release. I am prepared to wire you the money up front... so you can buy yourself a new pair of jellies or whatever they call them... - They call them flip-flops, Dad. Don't interrupt your father when he is doing a deal. Okay? Watch and learn. My boat's out of the water anyway. I'm having them fix it overnight. Okay. All I'm gonna guarantee you are seals. Okay? Now, if I find a good shark... and I say if... I might let you out of the cage. But it's absolutely my call. Okay? So, if that sounds like a deal that you wanna make, then I'm more than happy to take you out... and maybe show you some sharks. Fantastic. - Sounds like we have a deal. - Deal. Cheers. Here's to swimming with great whites. Cheers. No. No alcohol. No alcohol. Bad luck. Oh? Is that a French thing? Champagne all around, then. So you contacted him? Well, it's through a friend of a friend. Okay. And it didn't even occur to you... that I haven't been in the water for about a year? It's like a bicycle. When you know it, you never forget it. Well, you make it sound so easy. It is. Let the guy swim with sharks, I film it, he shows it to his friends or whatever. What do I care? Take the money. Okay, I'll take the money. But let me tell you something. I decide if he gets out of the cage. - Okay, boss. - Good. We serve the boat, and we go back where we belong... far from here, closer to nature. And I make this movie about you and the sharks, and I call it Mysteries of the Deep. What? Mysteries of the Deep? I like it. It's catchy. You can't come up with something better than that? What you say? I say I need Tommy. He already said yes. How did I know you would say that? 'Cause you've known me so long. Hey. What about Legend of the Deep? That's good. Of course, you're the legend, no? You're so cheesy. Well, I'm French. I like cheese. Ooh. No! Legend of the Deep. No. - Well... - Get off. Think about it. Guys, we don't have a lot of time. Let's go. Let's move. Move it. Come on. Hurry up. Come on. Step it up. It's a 20-minute swim to Seal Island, if the sharks don't get you first. Okay. Let's go. We've gotta move. We've gotta move. Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Come on, boy. Wait up, old man. I'm coming. Come on, boy. You're a bit slow there. Come on, boss. We can't wait for him. Let's go, let's go. Come on, boy. Move. You're not going for a stroll on the beach. We're poachers, man, not shell collectors. Come on. Let's make some money, eh? You did it, boy. There you go, eh? Patrol, come in. Patrol is receiving. Go ahead. We've got a white Toyota pickup out at Miller's Point, yeah? Any plates? Over. No plates. Looks like abalone poachers. Over. But if they're out to Seal Island, there's a 50-50 chance they're not making it back, - so send a tow truck, yeah? - Okay. Will do. We'll get good money for that. There's plenty down there. Hey, I've got a nice big one over here. That's a nice fat one. Come on, boys. We've got enough. Let's head back to land. Come on, come on. Let's go. We don't have a lot of time, boys. Wait up! Come on, boy! Hurry up! The car's waiting for you there. Wait! Hurry up. Don't fall behind. Hey, guys! Slow down! Come on, boy! Wait up for me! Swim, man, swim. Come on! Hey, guys, slow down! Hey, wait up! Hey, guys! Come on, guys, stop. Stop messing around, guys. - Here you go. - I've got it. Yeah. Thank you. Whale watch, huh? Don't ask, don't tell. Whale season's over. It says so on your license, I believe. I'm gonna have to bury you under a flower bush, I see. Mm-mm. Be safe out there. Yeah. Park here. Thank you. Here you go. - Morning. - Hello. - This yours? - Yep. Kind of cozy. - Yep. - But she's seaworthy, yeah? Yep. We don't need the tanks. I thought we were going underwater. You're going in a cage, so I'll send you down a line. And if I let you out of the cage, you're gonna free dive. Sharks don't like bubbles. Okay. Cool. Well, I'm good to hold my breath for about three minutes. How about you? I don't know. He's been practicing in the bath. Let's go. Dick. - Hey. Tommy. - Hey. William. - Nice to meet you. - Hey. - Hi. Tommy. - Hi. - Hi, guys. Good to see you again. - Hi, Jeff. How are you? Did you tell him he could smoke? No smoking on the boat. - Hmm? - No smoking. I paid to dive with sharks, not to quit smoking, right? Come on. Didn't you fly here... - for 12 hours? - Mm-hmm. - Did you smoke? - Mm-hmm. Got my own plane, honey. I smoke on my own plane, okay? Well, I got my own boat, honey. No smoking. - Mm. Mm-mm... - Whoa, whoa. Please. - Ask nicely. - Dad, come on. Don't be a dick. Dad, don't be a dick. Just put it out. Oh, my God. Look, okay. If it means so much to you all, there you go. Okay? But I'm warning you all, I'm gonna get cranky. Breakfast! Hey, Jeff! - Hey, you want a beer? You want one? - No, thanks. I'll have one. - You want one? - Yeah. Go on then. Don't drink it all at once. Here you go, mate. Thank you. Cheers. Whoo-hoo-hoo. Cheers. Here's to swimming with sharks. Ah. All right. Here's one. Think before you answer. How do you outswim a shark? You don't. You just have to outswim the chap next to you. Ah. - You heard that one. - Who hasn't? Yeah. Right. Jeff, this cage... it's pretty sturdy, right? Yeah. What about this? What's this for? Just in case? Well, you know, sometimes shit happens. Well, does shit happen a lot? You mean with Kate? Shit is happening all the time, my friend. Tommy, the head is clogged. Take care of it, please. - Got it, skipper. - Thanks. - Go. Go, go, go, go. - Whoa! Turn the whole pad. You'll clear it. Turn it towards you, like the reins of a horse. Aah! - Give me a turn. - No! No! Wait! - It's mine! - I got it. Please. Luke, get out here! Dolphins! Look here. How's that? Oh, man. Are there always so many? No. This is rare. This is good. - They're so close. - Yeah. They love surfing the wake. Does the boat ever hit them? Only the dumb ones. How do you make a woman make a noise like a dolphin? - How? - You stick your willy just near her bum, and she goes, "Aa-ah, ah-ah". That's terrible. Kate doesn't laugh at that either. Don't laugh. Not funny. This is good. Okay. Ready? Go. Oh. Ohh. Want a taste? Try it. No. I'm good. Sharkies love it. Kate's been talking to them for years in sharkie language, asking what they're favorite flavor is, and this, my friend, is it. Yeah. Blood. That's beautiful. Chunks. Yeah. If you want, we can keep the leftovers, have a romantic candlelit dinner for two later. As appealing as that is, I'll pass, thanks. Where are the sharks? I thought they were guaranteed. Well, sharks are extremely intelligent, but they haven't quite figured out how to RSVP. But what I did guarantee you were seals. There you go. You sure delivered there. I did. 47,000 of them. Well, 100K to swim with a seal. Lucky me. Nice. How you like the 5D? - I like it. - Can I have a look? Yeah. Definitely. Here. I'll just go and get changed. I've got my eye on it, but a bit pricey. Oh, yeah. I know. You've got a good eye. Thanks. Shall I have a go? S'il vous plat. Merci. Oh, did I pay for this? Right. So I'll take a thousand pictures, yeah? I get one in focus, and ya-da, I'm a photographer. Is that it? A bit more complicated than that. Yeah? You think? Here you go. There you are. Check them out. Hang on a minute. How come you get to smoke? I know the owner. Give us one, then? Come on, mate. - Promise him more. - Yeah, man. He's a funny guy. - Can I say something? - Yeah. When you're shooting with backlight, you need to change some settings. - Yeah? - And as for composition, you've got none. Nice. What do you wanna do? You wanna score the goal, or do you want to be the guy who takes the picture of the guy scoring the goal? - Save it. - Live a bit, babe. This kid, right? You take him to a hooker, he'd take photographs of the hooker. My fault. It's the way I brought them up. They're all spoiled rotten. That's what happens when you bring up kids who don't need to earn a living. Bullshit. I grew up with no money, and I'm a photographer. Yeah? Okay. Luke, tell the frog prince here how much money you think you can actually make... - What did you just call me? - from this hobby photography? - Sorry? - I didn't hear it. Hey, hey. I'm just joking, mate. Don't start this shit with me. There's no shit. I'm just having a laugh. Don't talk like that. It's about respect, okay? I apologize. Yeah? I'm just making a stupid joke. I'm stupid, making a stupid joke. I don't like your joke. Wow. Is he always like that? This is a good day. He usually is a ten-out-of-ten prick. Lucky you. - Why the tapping? - They like the sound. They'll come, and you'll see. Keep going. Open ocean, you, me... Brings back good memories. Hmm? The funny thing about memories is... you remember the good ones and forget the shitty. Yeah? And there were a lot of shitty ones, huh? I think... That pan again? What, shitty? No. I mean... You know what I mean. You know what I mean. Where's your ring? Sorry. I was broke. Oh, gosh. Where's your ring? Incoming! Incoming. Bring him back. How big do you think he is? About three meters. - Are you seeing this? - Yeah, I got him. Come on, boy! - Big, man. She's big. - Look at her mouth! Wow! God, she's gorgeous. - She's beautiful. - She's a he. How do you know it's a male? 'Cause I can see claspers on his anal fins. Essentially, that's like two penises. All right! This isn't the one. So sharks have really sensitive snouts. So they can actually feel your heart rate. So they sense nervousness. Wow! Look at those teeth! She's beautiful. Look at her fins. - Let's go! - Let's do it. Hey. No pressure, huh? If you want, I can go in the water first, just to check things out. I'm good. It's gonna be fine. Aren't you scared they're gonna mistake you for food? Here you go. Have fun down there. Welcome back, my wealthy friends. Step inside, step inside. Mind your head on here. Have hands and feet in the cage at all times... in case our friends get curious. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine.  Was it nice? Shark's gone. - Up with the cage. - All right. Oh, I'm freezing! That was amazing. - Hey. - I got good shots. - Kate, that was great. Thanks. - Good. Okay. Great. Ah. What happened to that shark? Well, we just call them in. Whether or not they stay is up to them. - Why not feeding them? - No, we don't feed sharks. Huh? No shit. That's why they're not hanging around. We don't want them to think the boat is the food. That's how accidents happen. You're chucking in a fish head and then waiting for them to come after it before you snatch it away... that's torture. That's against the Geneva Convention. Well, don't worry. We'll find you sharks. - This is our job. - How deeply reassuring. Tommy, bring out your girlfriend. Hey, sexy. - What is that? - This is my baby. "Stop looking at my bottom". You don't have a bottom any more. Tommy, put it in. It's going in. - Luke! - Yeah? Get out your camera. You're gonna wanna get this. - Got it. - Good. We're gonna circle around the launchpad. Okay. I'll keep an eye on the depth. Looking good. Luke, get low. Get low. Put the decoy in the bottom of your frame. I'm ready. Ease off just a whisker. Give her just a little bit. You telling me how to drive now? I mean, are you serious? Kate, are you serious? How long do we have to tool around with him... in a car with the others looking for a shark? However long it takes. Shut up, Dad. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Check it out. Suicidal seal, 4:00. Where? Whoa! You see that? Cool! That's how long. - I saw that. - He's devouring him! - You got it? - Yeah, I got it. - Hey, Jeff, take a look at that. - Check it out. Wow. That's what I'm talking about. - That was insane. - Oh, look at all those seal pieces. Hey, look, very few people get to see that. - Tommy, drop anchor. - All right, skipper. You wanna grab her? Seriously? I'll do it. No. No, no, no. I've got it. Here. You take pictures. That's my girlfriend. Careful. Oh, she's too far out. It's coming. Just paddle in the water. Yeah. Careful. Careful. There's little sharks down there. No! What was that? There's sharks down there. You gotta watch out, be careful. - Exactly! - Not okay? - No. - I'm sorry. - It's yours. - Sorry. Hey, it's my girlfriend. That was seriously uncool. There's no comedy on this boat. Seems like he's hunting. What do you think? Huh? - Let's do it. - Let's do it. Let's get in. Let's get in the water. - Let's go. - Yeah? Luke, let's do it. Get in your wet suit. So you sure about this? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? I don't know. Visibility's getting worse. Obviously he's not a player. Oh, you're worried about me now, huh? Yeah. Well, you weren't last month or the month before that or the month before that... Oh, please. That was five years ago. But... - You know it. - I'm good. I got this. Come on. Don't worry. Help me. Come on. Help me. Come on. I'm worried. Ohh. Come on. Let's go. Are you going to kiss me or what? - You want me to? - Yeah. Christ's sakes, just push it in. - I'm trying. - Straighten your leg out. - Push with your leg. - I'm trying, Dad. Aah! You're hurting me. You know what? I don't even wanna go back in the water. Come on. It was your idea. What's wrong with you? - My idea? You dragged me out here. - Okay. It was our idea. Other one. You said, "Shark diving. Yes. How cool". Remember? Yeah. Because I wanted to spend some time with you. I never ever get to see you. Yeah, well, if you wanna spend time with me, let's get in the cage. Let's get down there with some sharks, yeah? - Sound good? - No, it doesn't sound good. I don't wanna go back in the cage. What? Spend some time with me while you've still got the chance. Don't play that card with me. What card? - Pathetic. - Oh. You're scared, yeah? You have to be an asshole to everyone. No one's impressed. Jesus Christ. I've got seven kids... from three different women, and only one of them's half a poof. - What did you say? - Half a poof! You know, just 'cause you're dying of cancer... doesn't give you license to be such an asshole! - What? I'm what? - Dying of cancer. Who told you that? Oh, Mom, of course. Yeah, you'd love that to be true, wouldn't you? You'd love to just inherit the rest of my money. Well, good luck with that. I'm not going anywhere. You can quit pretending. You've got, what, three months? That's just enough time for you to be a better person. - You could try being a better father. - A better dad? What, better than this? You kidding? Yeah. It doesn't get better than that, does it? - Yeah. - I'll just get better and better. I'll be a compassionate, lovely guy. In the meantime, I'm going diving. - Come on! - No! Dad, I don't wanna go back in the suit! - Put your arm in there. - No! - Whoa, guys. Cool it. - Put your arm in there! - Cool it. - Wait. What's it got to do with you? Huh? What's it got to do with you, eh? You're in my family now, is it? By the way... Whoa! You just hit me? Did you just hit me? That's a push. I don't want to hit you, okay? Just calm down. Come on. Come on. No bad feelings. You should've given me a cigarette when you had the chance, buddy. I told you I was gonna get cranky. Don't get too excited about the fins. Only use them if the boss tells you to. Okay. I'm locking you in. You good? Going down. - Out! - Okay. Wait a minute. - Come on! - Hold on. Out! I've got it. Okay. I'm fine. All right? Turn it off. What's the matter with you? Leave me alone. I said, "In the cage". What part of "in the cage" did you forget? - Hey, calm down. - Calm down? This happens to be my boat. Hey, that was a cool dive. High five. High five? You wanna kill yourself, kill yourself, not the rest of us. What's your problem? Look, hang on. Let me check. Yeah, I'm all still here. Stop getting upset. If I wanna get out of the cage, I'm getting out of the cage. Okay. Tommy, pull anchor. - We're outta here. - Forget it. Tommy... - Hold on, Tommy. - No, no, no. Uh-uh. No, no. We're done. - Hear me? Done. - Take it easy. - Everyone is okay. - Thank you, Jeff. I paid big money to get out of a cage and swim in the water with a shark. And your boyfriend assured me that he would make that happen. - Right? - My boy... - My boyfriend said that? - Yeah. Help me out here, Jeff. - I never said "boyfriend". - Aw, come on. - You said it? - I never said "boyfriend". Okay, I'm gonna get the text. You told him he could get outta the cage. Did you tell him he could... - No. - Wow. Awkward. - You wanna hear a joke? - No. There you go. Straight from your boyfriend's phone. All right? Hey! What is going on here? Thanks, mate. That really helps. Yeah. But that was a great dive, by the way. That was a cool dive. What are you doing? Why are you freaking out? I don't understand. What's your problem? That was so wrong. You have taken people out of the cage before. The guy is an asshole, but he signed a release. 'Cause you told him he could do something that I wasn't even sure I could do. But of course you can do it. You have it. I wish I would have it. I have to be the guy with the camera. Oh, right, 'cause I'm the shark whisperer. - Yeah. - Legend of the deep. Stop it! - Stop it! - Stop what? Stop using me to make money! That's what. That's what you think I'm doing? Have you ever done one Jean Francois video without me? - Just one? Can you think of one? - Whoa. - That's what you think I'm doing? - Yeah. And Brady's money didn't hurt, did it? Brady's money is already in your bank account. It's all yours! I didn't take a penny of it! I don't give a shit of it! You got that? I love you. Always have. And what I was doing is to help you, to make you happy. It didn't work, but I was trying. I was really trying. In other words, you make it impossible! - And you know what? - What? - It's over! - It's over? - Yes. Fine! - Fine! I got it! This was all a bad idea. My fault! Let's go back. You hear me? Let's go back! As soon as we touch land, you won't see me any more. I promise. You won't see me. Let's go. Start the engine, Captain. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. What? - Let's go. Come on. - Let's go where? Let's go see the sharks! Come on! Let's go! Listen. Listen. First of all, stop the screaming. I'm not a dog, I'm a man, first of all. Second of all, it's your boat. We do what you want. Let's go. You want to go? Let's go. Let's go. Tommy, up with the cage! Are we going home? Nope. What are we doing? He wants to see big ones? Let's show him big ones. - Oh, shit. - There you go. That's more like it. Throw him in with the biggest, meanest buggers you can find. Where are we going? - Shark Alley. - Around the Cape? It's blowing 40 knots out of the northwest. I tell you guys, as soon as we leave the protection of the bay, - we're gonna take it on the chin. - We can handle it. It's gonna be wet and wild, baby! This fool's paid big money to see big sharks. We must give him his money's worth. Let's do it. Let's do it! Yeah. Come on, then. Whoa! Luke's chumming the water!  Come on, come on, come on! Get him! Aah! Ah! Come on, come on! Get him! Get him! Get him! Mercy. No mercy. It's stuck. Dude! - Whoa! Slip line! - Tommy. Tommy! Tommy! - What? - It's not steering any more. - Yeah. Give me a second. - No. Go check it out now, please. Get back up here! Move! Hey, can you sing my name, not shout it? What are you doing? Give me a second, yeah? Figure it out? Hey, the hydraulic line's gone! I just paid to get this boat reconditioned. It's an old boat. Shit happens. Tommy, I thought we fixed it. Okay. What does that mean? It's just a little steering difficulty. - Can you fix it? - Yeah. Yeah. I'm just gonna replace all the hoses, bleed the lines, then I'm gonna do a little dance. - Taking a piss? - Let's do it manually. - Kate! - What? Kate, we're steering manually! - Get the tiller. - Yeah. Wait. Hang on a minute. You said you could fix it. Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna try. We'll see. What's that? Tommy, are we gonna be okay? We're gonna be peachy. - Put this on. - Dad, no. - I'm fine. - Put it on. Come on. - Okay. - I can't see! Hull starboard! We're gonna be on the rocks! I can't see! - Good job. - Easy on the throttle! No! We've gotta get through it! - Okay! Here we go! - Whoo-hoo! Jeff, have you done this before? Yeah, in another life. Tommy, check out the starboard! How deep is it? How we looking? It's getting really shallow. How shallow is shallow? Like three meters.  It's all right. We're okay. We've got ten meters. Good. Tommy, now get back to the tiller. - Starboard! - Starboard! I got it! How's it looking? Kate, the steering's fixed. You should have control of the wheel. Good. Straight. I'm glad you came. We're gonna be all right. We're gonna be all right. Don't worry. It'll be okay. Don't worry. Hey, I, uh... I owe you an apology. I'm sorry. I know why you're upset. It's 'cause of your friend. I lost a friend on Everest. He was... He was right behind me on the rope, you know. He's still up there. How much longer? I don't know. What, an hour, hour and a half? Maybe more. We'll see. Hey. I'm sorry.  Are we really going in the water? Yep. You wanna see sharks, don't you? They're not gonna just jump on the boat. And there's big ones down there, right? Come on. You wanna put your courage on the line, don't you? Pull it out. Let me see how big it is. Come on. Let's go. Get on your suit. We're going in. Okay. Got some action. Two, three big boys. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, everybody. Suit up. - Hold on. - Get it up. Aren't they even going to play? Nope. No time for that. If you see a shark, just hit it in its snout. - You'll be good. - Yeah, right. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get in the... Don't you think it's better if I get in the cage first? Oh! Now you wanna get in the cage. I thought you wanted to swim with sharks. Come on, Dad. Go swim with sharks, out of the cage. Well, if you check it out, then if it's safe, then I'll come out. What happened to your courage? You had big courage in there. What happened to the "I wanna swim outside the cage with sharks"? My courage is right there in the cage. When it's safe, I'll get out. - But I'll start in the cage. - Get in the cage, then. Let's go. - All done, Dad. - Thanks, son. - Can we go? - Yep. Here we go. Living my dream. You wait for me, huh? Kate! Impossible. She's impossible! I said wait for me. What's wrong with you? That's how you shit now. Let's go. Come on. Everybody, let's go! - Hey, good luck. - Okay. Ready? Yeah. Ready. - Think you can get in? - Okay. Keep it steady. Are we anchored out here? - Good. You're good. - Aah! Just hold on. I'm gonna take you down now. Where are you going? We're drifting. I'm gonna go check the anchor. Is everything all right? Shit! - What's going on? - Anchor's dragging. I've gotta get the cage up and the boat headed into the waves. Can you give me a hand and grab the rope? Yeah. Got it. Damn it! Come on, man! What's going on? We're stuck! Aah, the gears are stripping. We gotta get the boat headed into the waves, or we're gonna flip. What? I've gotta get this engine started first. Yes! Beautiful! Come here, kid. Come inside. Okay. - Have you driven a boat before? - On my iPad. Okay. Uh... - Forward to go forward. - Okay. Backwards to go backwards. Simple. - Remember that? - Yeah. Forward to go forward back to go back. - Can you see me? You can hear me? - I can hear you. Come on, Tommy. Tell me what's going on out there. We've got to turn the boat into the waves or we're going over! We gotta turn the boat into the waves. Gotta get the head into the waves. Forward! Come forward! That's what I'm doing! Ohh. Ohh! Power left! Power left! Tommy! Big wave! Hold on! Oh, shit! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Could you check with Cape Point then? We've had no distress calls from that area. I understand you haven't received any call. I understand that. But you need to send someone out there. I know. I feel it. Something is wrong. Well, look, I'll check with my colleague. But without any distress call, we can't send the helicopters out. Could I speak to your superior, please? My superior will back me up on this, ma'am. - That's not what I mean. - Well, what do you mean? You have to send someone out there. - You have to. - What is the name of the boat? V/O/L/A/N/T/E. Volante. - Ok, I'll run another check straightaway. - Please. What happened? I tried to get the anchor up, and we got broadsided. - Are you okay? - I don't know. I'm freezing. I can't feel my hands. I don't know where Luke is. Come on. Okay. Tommy, hang on. Hang on. I can't feel my body. I can't hold on. Take it easy. Take it easy. I got you. Just swim on your back. Get on the boat! Out of the water! What happened? The anchor came up. We got broadsided. - Where's Luke? - I don't know. - Where's my son? - I don't know. - Where was he? - He was inside when we went over. Okay. I'm gonna go check. I'll be back. - Can you hang on? - I don't know. Tommy. Tommy, I got you. Stay out of the water. Come here. Pull. Luke! Luke! A shark! I just saw a shark! I can't find him. Could he be underneath? He might be underneath the boat. Cut it off. We're sinking. I gotta find the life raft. Move to the life raft. We've got blood here. Stay out of the water. Kate! Kate!  Dad! That Luke? He's over there! Dad. Luke! Luke! Tommy, you've got to stay awake! Let me see! Luke! - It's dark. - Yeah. I've got you. I can't feel my legs. They're still there. Just kick. Aah! Aah! I got him. Hold on. I just need a moment. Aah! Dad. Dad. Ohh! Dad! Dad! Come on! Dad!  You're gonna make it. - Aah! - Nooo! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy, wake up! Tommy! Oh! Talk to me! What happened? Tommy! Tommy! No! Tommy! Tommy. Tommy!  Dad! Dad! Dad! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!   For as long as I can remember, I've been drawn to sharks. They're the most amazing... and mysterious animals on earth. Last year, Jeff and I tagged... a female great white shark... in Gansbaai, South Africa, and we tracked her as she swam... 11,000 kilometers in 99 days... to North Western Australia. Despite the potential dangers, the unknown difficulties of the journey, and the sheer distance involved, in the end, she went back to the place she came from. In the end, she turned around and she went home.  I can't shake this feeling  It won't let me go  There's no use in running  When it's out of my control  Don't ask me why I'm crying  If you already know  Want to tell you that I'm sorry  But there's nothing I can do  Why do my sorrows fade away  At the heart  When I know I would follow you  To the end of the earth  Did I put you first  Now I'm scared  I feel so alone  And I can't bear  To be without you  No  Why do my sorrows fade away  At my heart  It's because you're gone  Feel the breeze in my hair  And I'm reminded of you  Now it feels like you're near  But the truth is so cold  So cold  I wish I could tell you  Just how much you mean to me  I hope you can hear me now  When I say  Why do my sorrows fade away  At my heart  When I know I would follow you  To the end of the earth  Did I put you first  Now I'm scared  I feel so alone  And I can't bear  To be without you  No  Why do my sorrows fade away  At my heart  It's because you're gone  Yeah  Gone  Ohhh  Yeah, yeah  It's because you're gone
