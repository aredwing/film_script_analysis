You're thinking something. Nothing. That's not true. It's true! Why wouldn't you tell me? What? Katia! You love me? More, more! What do you want for dinner? No idea. Chinese? Seen a place? Yes. Great. It's always the same. Yeah. What's that? I don't know. I think... There, I've finished. Why don't you ask him? Want me to do it? I can go ask him. Fine. What's that guy eating? She's upset. We didn't order much. It's normal. Are you happy to start scouting? I'm happy to be here with you. Go on. You can go with her. Go on. Come on! You drive. - Okay? - Yes. Go on. Can you tell me where the brake is? The accelerator? You push there. Wait... The brake. Push it. Go. Slowly, yes. Katia, slowly. Very good. Turn left. Is it serious? I'm sorry, I do stupid things. You think it'll be okay? I'm sorry. And it's not over, not yet. I'm sorry, if you want to help, you need to help me properly. No, David, stop! No. Why not? Not here. Okay. Let's go. I'm too dry, my love. Let's lie down. It hurts. My ass. You can lie on my feet. Yes. We're going to burn. Let's burn! Sheltered! I'm burning. Me too. It's beautiful here. Let's go. I don't want to go back. Let's go. I don't want to go back. Please... Why? Because. You hear that? The storm... We have to leave. It's dangerous. No, that's not true. Oh, that's good. You're crazy! I'm sorry. I'm sorry... You hurt me. What's that? A father confessing to his wife that he has slept with their daughter. The poor thing. Who? The mother. You wouldn't do that? What? Are you crazy? What are we going to do? I don't know. I'm hungry. Already! All right. Great! Found it? Yes. I don't know which one to get. - What did you buy? - Cream for me. Let's go there! I'm starving! Hey, she's too tall. What? You think so? Don't you think so? What? You wouldn't want me to shave my head like them? If you do, I'll... If you do... I'll leave you. You don't like Marines? I do! They're really handsome. That's how it is. What are you talking about? Is it good? It's not good. But it's good. I don't understand. You say things I don't understand. There's nothing to understand. Fine. Fine. Are you sulking? No, I'm not sulking. Yes, you are sulking. I love you. I want you. I want you too, my love. Shall we go? Let's go! - David, shall I lock it? - Yes. Okay? It's stuck. Does it work? Shall we go? What do you put in your hair? I'm driving. Not too fast, I want to pee. Stop! You see, we're not alone. I know. I know! There... Can I? I don't understand. What is that? What does it mean? Maybe you should check the road. Okay? Okay? Hey, a house. Look at the dogs! The dogs! Good dog. Good boy. You're a real dog. Shall we go? Look at him. Let's go. Come on! Come with me. Run, run... Stop! You hit the dog! Look! Oh, shit... Do something. Go on, do something! Call someone! Look... Call someone! Katia, look. Call someone! Call someone! Do something for the dog! Do something now! You don't give a damn! You don't care. Do something, it's... You see! You don't give a damn. You don't. - You have no heart. - That's not true! You almost killed him. Nasty man! He was all black... with three legs. I'm coming... My love. I'm splitting. Go ahead. Cut it out, Katia. Watch the car! You're not well. Fuck off! Stop! Stop! They're crazy! It scares me. What does? I don't know. Shall we go? Yes. What are we going to do, David? I don't know. Shall we turn back? Where? I'll drive. Guide me. He's crazy, David! Quick! We must call the police. I love you. You want to eat?
