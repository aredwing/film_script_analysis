Passengers are kindly requested to take their seats... - Tea? - Yes, please. - And? - Mom, I'm ready. How many times have I told you not to speak Belarusian? - Okay, let's get started. - Mommy, only this little part. No, the entire page, like we agreed. But Mom... If you learn English, you'll be able to travel the world. Wouldn't you like to live in Paris or London? Or in Sweden... Where Mrs. Kosinski's daughter went. What was her name? Gosia. She learnt English and went to Sweden. And now she lives in luxury. Look, what a beautiful house she has. What clothes... Look at her car. When Grandpa was alive, he made me learn English, so that I could go West one day. And Daddy? When he was still alive, did he want to go abroad too? Come on, Ania... Hello, ladies! Hello... What a surprise. Good morning, Jurij. Nice to see you. Sorry about the light. - Jadzia, get a new light bulb. It's alright, don't bother. Goodness! Marta, is this beauty your daughter Ania? She has become a real lady. She is still just a child. Ania, come and say hello to "Uncle" Jurij. Hello, Uncle Jurij. The toilette has just been cleaned. See you around, baby doll. - Hello. - Good morning... Ania? Come to me. What happened? Come here. There, there. She won't be going to Minsk. Over my dead body. - But the deal's already been made! - She's just a child. Don't you know why Jurij takes those girls there? There's no fucking work, no money, no food! It's my child. You're not her father. You have no say! I've taken the money already! So you'll go to Jurij, explain everything and apologize. I can do it. Remember what Jurij did to that guy who cheated him? He's dead! - So I'll go to the police. - I'll fucking kill you! - Witek. - Don't fuck with me. Witek! Leave Mommy alone! Everything is arranged. Are you sure about this, Marta? I have no choice. On Thursday, the same guy will be waiting for you... The one who smuggled... Gosia. You just have to get to Minsk on your own. Gosia's address and phone number are on the back. I tried to call her but with no luck. Take this photo. For luck. She made it, so will you. Do you have any money? I'll take the money that Witek got from Jurij. Are you crazy, Marta? Not only will you steal the money, you will also run away with the girl... If he finds you, he'll kill you. It's the fucking mafia. - I have to do it. - And what if they send you back? They won't. It would be a death sentence. Jadzia... Look, Gosia lives here, and where are we going? Somewhere around here. So near. Can we visit her every day? We're here, Mom. What's wrong, Mommy? - Can I sleep in this bed, Mommy? - Sure, honey. - I'll stick it here, okay? - Great. What's going on? Let's go take a shower. It was a long journey. - But what did she tell you? - Do you have soap? - What does 'rape' mean? - I don't know all English words. - How are you doing, honey? - I'm fine. - Ania, come out. - In a second... Come out now. - Do you want the soap? - No, I'll have a shower tomorrow. Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee... Let's go to sleep. - Can I sleep with you, Mommy? - Come here. Mommy? I'm scared. Why? I'm scared they'll make us go back home. This is a good country, with good people. Nobody will make us go back. If they send us back, promise you'll hold me tight. So tight that they won't be able to take me away. No one will take you away from me. Can we visit Gosia tomorrow? - We can't leave the camp now. - So it's a prison? Don't be silly. Go to sleep. Sleep now. Let's sit over there. Mommy, are we on the list? No, honey. Go play with the other children. I need to talk to Anissa. No. - Go on, don't be shy. - I don't want to. Stay here. Ania! I had to see those Koreans, good news takes time... This is Marta Kowalski and her daughter. Here is their file... Case number 978062. Here you go... Ania, stop it. I need to pee... You have no right to treat me like this! I'm an educated man! Ania! Ania! Ania, get over here! How could you take off like that? I've told you never to talk to strangers! I was trying to find a toilet and I fell... - What's this? - A chocolate bar. That man gave it to me so I would stop crying. How many times have I told you never to take things from strangers?! I'm sorry... Jesus, sweetheart, don't ever do this to me again. Okay, let's go and visit Gosia now. You have to look nice, she's important around here. So let's go and change. It's so beautiful here. It's like Santa's land. Because this is Santa's land. He lives here in the Far North. Mom look, Santa! I'd like to stay here in Sweden. We are going to stay, honey. We're here. Maybe she sold the house. This is the right address. Ready? Turn on the light. - It doesn't work. - Try the button downstairs. It's about time... I've been waiting for an hour. If you want to work instead of Gosia, you can't make her customers wait. Get it? Are you coming in or not? Why aren't you asleep? Let's go to bed. Ania! - Mom, why is there a knife here? - I don't know. Come on. Ania! Ali said he'd protect us from Anissa! - What are you talking about? - Come and talk to him! You're not allowed to talk to him ever again. Understand? What if we meet that strange, unpleasant man again? Don't talk like that about people. I'm sure Gosia is back home now. Hi, Adam. Sure, I can send Gosia over to you. Friday, at ten... No problem. You pay her depending on what you want her to do. That's right. Have a nice day. Are you sure you don't want to take a shower with me? No, I'll stay here and guard the door. Okay, I won't be long. Just knock if there is anything. Mommy! Ania! What happened? - What happened?! - Someone tried to get into the bathroom. I wanted to stop him but he put his hand over my mouth... - Who, Ali? - Ali came and chased him away. Stop playing games. You think I don't know you're hiding something? You'd better leave her alone. If you hurt her or the girl I will kill you. - Are you all right, honey? - Yes. Pick up, pick up... Gosia. Gosia? Thank God! Hi, it's me, Marta. Thank God you answered the phone, I've called a million times. Hello. I heard you were looking for me. Marta Kowalska, right? - Don't you remember me? - I wasn't sure at first. I remembered a Marta with a kid living with this guy named Witek... ...but I wasn't sure it was you until Bengt confirmed it to me. He scared me asking all those questions, so I ran away. Sorry, I asked him to do that. I wanted to be sure it was you before handing out my phone number. Why don't you come to the Chinese restaurant Nan King tonight at eight. It's near my house, just down the street. And we can talk. Eight o'clock. Great. I have to go now. See you soon. Yes, okay. Bye. Mommy! - Absolutely... - Cheers. Gosia... Hello. Hi, hon. I hardly recognized you. I hardly recognized you, either. You look so... Swedish. Great. I try to keep up with the fashions. And where is Ania? She's in bed. My roommate is taking care of her. Let me introduce you. This is Marta, my friend from Belarus. That's Pekka, my husband. My husband Pekka. These are our friends: Jurek, Sasha, Olga and Ania. You've already met Bengt. He's my husband's childhood friend and our helpful neighbor. Hi. You're the person Bengt thought was me when I was late for work... - That must have been unpleasant. - Don't worry about it. Jesus, how many years has it been? Here he is, our Bengt. Seriously this man is gold. He helps us with everything. Just recently I went on this trip and forgot my cell phone at home. You know how it is with business, customers, calls... Bengt stayed at my flat to answer calls and schedule my clients. A gem! Cheers! Your story is just so fucking unbelievable. That's terrible. You took a huge risk. I had no choice. If they send you back, it will be the end for you and your daughter. I know, that's why I can't go back. You certainly can't. Oh well, here's to you... And how's my mother? She's well, I think. Your mother is an absolute saint. When you send her money, she gives it all away to needy people in the village. That's exactly what drives me fucking mad. I send her money and she gives it all away. If she's such a fucking saint, she can earn it herself! It's not like that. She's so proud of you. She told me that she always knew that you'd make it. And when I saw that photo of your house and the car... You looked like a queen! Don't you all have anything better to do back home? Let's drink. She is so damn pretty... I bet your business is going well? Business is fine. I make a living. Great. This is just great. Your mother said you sell houses. Yes, more or less. Great. So you buy old houses, restore them and sell them? Yes, sure. Let's not talk about it. - You're a real businesswoman. - Yes, indeed. Let's go dance. Pekka, let's dance. Come on. Mom, do you think Ali would like to have a daughter like me? Darling, everyone would like to have a daughter like you. You look like a real princess. Why haven't you used makeup before? Hold it, I need to go to the toilet. Look, Ali gave us a heater. He said our room is like a fridge. We've made it! They won't send us back now. Not when they gave us this flat. The rest is just a formality. - Sorry, I can't come. I work tonight. - Don't you want to see my new flat? Of course, but I'm really busy. Why don't you come around sometime? I've got to go, I'm running late. See you. Bye. Thanks. Look! I found a flashlight! It's going to be a real interrogation. Damn, I don't know what more I can tell them. What did you tell them? What's your size, honey? - What? - What's your waist size? Everything's going to be fine. Put this on, we're going to Bengt. To Bengt? - Yes. He's waiting for you. - For me? For you... For us. We'll have a drink. It will calm you down. Then we're going to talk about your interrogation. I promise. Hurry up now. Move it. You look great, fantastic, but the jacket is hiding everything. - This skirt is so short. - It's very fashionable here now. The door's open? Wait here a moment. Bengt. Wake up. You've overslept. - I've overslept... What time is it? - Hang on. Hello? Yes, that's me... Yes, I'm free. I can... I can come over. Around ten o'clock. I'm pretty busy right now, can I call you back? Right... Well, we'll talk about prices when I get there. It all depends on what you want me to do. I'm busy right now. Can I call you back? Bye-bye. I'm leaving. What happened? Where are you going? I don't know what I'm doing here. I look like a whore. - Calm down, please. - No. Have a nice evening. I know this is difficult, honey. But we have to do it. If I tell them, will they let us stay? Promise? Yes, baby. Let's try again. Why don't they want us here? We didn't do anything wrong. - Leave him alone. Let's go to bed. - But we have to say our prayers. Otherwise God will be angry and he won't watch over us tomorrow. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee... Let's go to sleep. Tomorrow is a big day. Me and Witek never got married. I lived with him after Ania's father died. I was in a difficult situation. My parents were dead... I didn't have a flat or a job and I had a child to feed. He had a house... ...and he was nice to us, at first. But there were no legal obligations? You could just leave him, right? No, if I had left him, I would have to live on the street. But you speak Polish. Why didn't you go to Poland? It's very difficult to find people that arrange smuggling. My friend knew someone who could bring us here. I didn't have time, I had to escape. Bye, honey. - Hi, it's me, Gosia. How are you? - I'm okay. I know you were upset last time. I'm sorry, I just wanted to help. - Help me? - Yes, help. Bengt is single and... Listen, I'm kind of busy right now. I'm calling to tell you something very important. I talked to Bengt, but he's so very shy. So we decided it would be better if I told you... - He can marry you. - What? They'll give you a resident permit. After a few years you'll get citizenship. He really is a good man, he's just lonely. He likes you a lot. - You're joking. - It's a golden opportunity. But I'm not for sale. Oh fuck, Marta! You weren't with Witek for love, right? That's how me and every other girl got our permits. You should thank me. Oh, God, oh God... Mommy, my teacher says I read very well in Swedish. I have a new friend. Could she come over on Saturday? Mom? What's going on? Open the door, Ania. Please open the door. Ania? Are you back already? Ania! Ania! You have reached Gosia and Pekka. We can't take your call right now... Now you see what a businesswoman I am. I clean. Please, don't tell my mother. I just don't know anymore... I don't know what to do. Calm down, darling. I know you don't want to listen to me, but look around you. Take my advice. Marry Bengt and all your problems will be over. For God's sake, Marta, think of your daughter. Are you listening? I married Pekka for the same reason, and I've learned to love him in time. Listen, Bengt is not a bad person. He is having a hard time. He's lonely, retired... He has no reason to get up in the morning. You don't have any other choice, kid. Mom? Mom... I'm here, baby. Get into bed. Look what Anissa brought us. Look... It's a bit broken, but I'm sure Ali can fix it. - Look at all the pretty colours. - I want to sleep, Mom. But these are dolphins. You like dolphins. I'll be right back. Sweetheart, we have something to celebrate. - I'm sleeping. - But I have great news. I promise. Promises, promises... They don't mean a thing. We've got permission to stay in Sweden. I was at the immigration office today and they said it. I love you, Mom! Where's Ali? - He's in Stockholm. - In Stockholm? Why? - He's looking for a flat for us. - We're going to live in Stockholm! - Let's have some ice-cream. - Okay. - I want the one with the peach. - I know. Wait here, I'll be right back. Mom... Has Ali found a nice place for us? Yes, a really great place. - What school will I go to? - For now you will have vacation. Vacation! Hurray! You have to rest after all this. See, everything will be as we dreamed. We're staying in Sweden. I'll go to a normal school with Swedish kids, and Ali will be with us. We'll have our own flat and you'll find a nice job. That's amazing, but I asked you to not jump on the bed. Calm down... Mom, you've slept for a long time. I brought you some milk with garlic, it will make you feel better. I think you have a fever. Take off those clothes and get under the covers. I'll go get your pajamas. - Hello, Gosia speaking. - Hi, it's me. I've made my decision. So, you're all packed now? We'll pick you up in an hour. Take care, sweetheart. Bye. Are you ready? Sweetheart, you've got to understand... This will be the best for us. For you.
