'One doesn't need big reasons for committing suicide.' 'When boyfriend doesn't message.' '..when girlfriend doesn't receive phone..' '..to scare parents.' '..when husband beats wife..' '..when wife scolds husband..' '..people are committing suicide for simple reasons.' 'Committing suicide is the biggest made when one can't face small problems.' 'Chandraleka is a strange thought.' '..of two lovers who were unsuccessful in love.' "I will always be with you like this forever." "I will bring happiness into your life." "So wonderful for you to say that." "You said the feelings in my heart." "I will always be with you like this forever." Come. Hey, come on. No. Be quiet. Darling, you look beautiful today. - Come on. Don't lie. - I'm telling the truth. Go away. You're so naughty. No. Superb! Okay! Coffee! Cold coffee! Last coffee. Have it. - Hey. Should I've coffee when I've to consume poison? There's still time to consume that. For now, have coffee. I don't want. - Alright. I will have it. Have it. Did you introduce yourselves to each other? What's the need when we are about to die? One has to be happy unfil you're alive. I'm dying just to be happy. - Exactly. There is no comfort, peace, happiness or excitement in my life. There is only one thing left, death. Why are we wasting time? Let's go. When I think about that demon.. It's coffee. - I lose my mind. For the problems that I have, I shouldn't be this far. I should've died two days ago. Shall I tell you a truth? Everyone is born and they also die without their own knowledge. But yours is a special case. You're dying despite of realizing things. For example. We go to a cloth shop.. ...we try a dress.. ...if we don't like it, we move to the next shop. That's how life is. If we don't get happiness in this life.. "We will surely get it in the next birth. As a good friend" ...the gift I wish to give you is a nice, fantastic death. There is a guesthouse 100 kms from here. My does everyone go to guesthouse? To rest. But there's a twist here. We will go there happily.. ...and commit suicide happily.. "And become ghosts. - Ghosts? - Yes. Oh. I'm scared of ghosts. Everyone become ghost after death. Now, let's go for shopping. Why shop when we have to die? Look, she wants to die consuming poison. You want to die by cutting your wrist. And I want to hang myself. We need materials for that. We need to buy them. Come on, get up. Let's shop. I will have coffee. Praveen. - Yes. - How about curling mywrisi with this cutter? With this? - Yes. You will struggle before death. Look, nylon rope. I will die very easily. This is what our seniors used. How about his rope? - This one? It is a bit fat. - Hey. Praveen . - Yes. This knife is very sharp. With this we can die easily. Really? You. Are you crazy. You want me to die right here? - Excuse me. - What? Shall I help you? We are totally confused which one to buy. Look, I'm here to resolve your confusion. Look, even we are expert is that. We want to die without anyone's knowledge. You didn't understand? - No. - We want to die. Sir. - Yes. - We have decided to commit suicide. Hence, we're here to shop. You tell us. ls this cutter better? - ls the rope better? Or the knife? Our death should be soft and sweet. Do you think I am fool? Yes. Stop it. Uncle, we want to die without any pain. Do you have any idea? - Don't worry. I will give you an idea. Look, this is toilet cleaner. 40 percent extra. If you use this to clean toilet, bacteria will die. Similarly, if you consume it, your body will get cleaned" "and you will die at once. What's the guarantee? I'm the guarantee. Look, open it, hold it like this and.. He is drinking it as if it is milk. - Uncle, don't drink it. Uncle, don't. Uncle, save some for us too. - Hey. How will he save some for you when he's going to die? This is enough for us. Escape. Bye. - Bye. Hey, why are you running away? Take this. Oh God. Did I drink this? I will surely die. Hamu! Govinda! Before we die, let's fulfill our last wish. Why? - Otherwise, after we die.. ...we will become ghosts and walk in parks, lodges. I won't become a ghost Do you know what my wish is? I want to rob a new car. Hob? - Yes. But I don't know driving. What kind of a girl is she? Forget her. What's your wish? The minister of my area is very arrogant... ...so I wish to barge into his house and slap him. In that case, you will surely die. - Why? If we get caught robbing, we will surely be killed. Even if we hit the minister, we will still get killed. Hey. - So we are surely going to die. Hey, look there. I want to rob that vehicle. - That one? Yes. - Don't make me angry. You think it is easy to rob it? Get lost. When you can't fulfill a girl's wish, you can't be a man. Is that so? - Yes. Let's go. - Go. Get me that jeep. Hail Lord Govinda! Lord Govinda, I bought a new vehicle. Bless it. Lord, bless it. - Okay. Hail Lord Govinda...! - Lord Govinda! Yeah! ' Yes! superb! We fulfilled your last wish. My tooth is aching severely. Boss, shall I call the doctor? - Shut up. God. It's aching severely. Sir, one snap, please. It's aching severely. Shall we start the interview? Boss, the journalist hasn't arrived yet. The journalist is yet to arrive. Should I start because you said? Wait for a while. God. So many people. - Hey Chandu. No. - Look, the media is here. Don't slap him. Listen to me. - Chandu. God. Why are you late? Shall we get started? Before we get started, I have a question, sir. Whatis it? Mahatma Gandhi has said if a person slaps on one cheek show him the other too. What should I show? Should I show my back? Should I show this? Should I show my back? What should I show? I'm serious and you are mocking me? Hurry UP- Com e. - Go. "Who will catch us? Who will stop us?" "We will do whatever we want." "We are not dolls. We never rely on anyone." "This is how we are." Start the car. Wow ! Yeah ! "Look, this is how we are." - Come on! "Just leave us alone." Come on, go fast! Go! Yeah g "The world is after money." "There's betrayal everywhere." "Everyone will pay a price some day." "Hichness is not everything." "We just don't care." "We dare come whatever." "Look, this is how we are." "Just leave us alone." Stop! I want to pee! - Be quiet! Please stop! - They are after us. - Please stop! Please. - Come fast Come on! Get in! Go fast "We are sure to suffer." "Then why should we worry?" "Now, it is all depends on fate." "Whatever we do will be craziness." "Lifeis so unfair." "We don't want to live here." "Look, this is how we are." "Just leave us alone." Hey! Buddy, get down. Let's have food. Wonderful inn. Is the food good here? - Wonderful vehicle. Sir, give me the key. - Why'? - I need to park it. Oh, you want to park it? - Yes. Here. - Park it properly. - Okay, sir. Hey. Luggage- Wait a minute. I will take the luggage. - Let it be, sir. You will keep it or we should keep it? - Leave it in the vehicle, sir. No, we will keep our luggage with us. Here, buddy. Catch. Here. - Bag. Hey. Thief! - Come. A thief shouldn't call another thief as thief. - Correct. But our vehicle? - Our wish got fulfilled. Let his wish also get fulfilled. - Yes. Yes. - Come, let's go. - Which way to the guesthouse? The guesthouse is close by. Let's walk.- Walk? Chandu, thanks for fulfilling my wish. - You're welcome. I'm famished. Order boneless pilaf for me. Okay. - But two minutes, I'll come. - Okay. Her last wish got fulfilled. - That's right. That girl is happy, right? - Yes. Then why she wants to die? - Love failure, like you. So why should she die? You're asking this? There can be hundreds of reasons to die. You're asking this? There can be hundreds of reasons to die. You're right, brother. Hi. Not hundreds of reasons, but thousands of reasons to die. By the way, who amongst you wants to die? - Three of us. Three? One, two is here, where is the third person? She will com e. - Alright. Including me, we will be four. Please, I will join you too. - lm possible. Please don't say like that. Past one week I've been looking for someone who will die with me. No one is ready to die with me. Please, I will join.. - Why do you want to die? It's a big story. - Make it short. My girlfriend refused to love me, I said I will die.. "And she said 'die'. What could I do? Sol decided to prove myself by dying before her. You can't prove anything after you die. - Correct. That's right. - Hi,guys.- Hi. Who is this girl? Hey, who is this guy? - Well, I'm Krishna. From Krishnagiri, rural side. Your new suicide partner. Hey, stay away from her. - Okay. Okay guys, I'm very happy to join you. Next minute, we are going to die. Let's celebrate. Okay. - Three pilaf. - What about me? Four pilaf. - Okay. - Have it and die. Give five. Let there be one extra. Is this the house? - Yes. Why did you fall silent? - We were happy all these years. I'm sad as we are going to die very soon. We were never happy. We were sad all these years, but now, we will die happily. Hey you, be quiet. Mr. Basanna said he will inform the watchman about our arrival. But I don't see anybody. - Who? Who are you? Look. ls he the one? Hey, who are you? How did you get in? We came inside opening the gate. Mr. Basanna musfve informed you about three persons. It's us. He said three persons, but you are four? Sorry. The one in the last". "Don't consider him as human being. It's just us. Butl can't let you in. Get going.- Why? Get going. I said I can't. - Stop it. Even he has to do his duty. Do as he says. Go away. Go away. - Come fast. - Come here. Don't get upset. What is your name? - Surya. - Surya. Look at the moon. It looks so beautiful. I've been there thrice. Don't you think you should go there at least for once? Keep looking at it, you will surely go there. What did he say and what did I understand? One girl and three boys. God. We should be fortunate to die in such a big house. Look, I will tell you a truth you are unaware of. Three people have died in this house. One died hanging himself. The other died consuming poison. The third person stabbed herself". "And died. Hey fatso, come here. - What? Why are you scaring everybody? Sir, this guesthouse has become popular.. "After three people committed suicide. At 12 am, they become ghosts" ...and start haunting this guesthouse. - Hey fatso. It must be their walking time. Just shut up. Hence, this place is not safe for you. Go. I said go. - Hey you. We are actually here to go. Do one thing. Come here at 12.. ...not three ghosts, we will show you seven ghosts. If you're okay, we will show you nine ghosts. Okay'? Am avasya! Stop. Kid, my God. You are so handsome. Did you come from Africa by walk? Look at him. He looks like roasted pig. He can be my perfect friend. He is the caretaker of this guesthouse. He only talks to ghosts and flies with spirits. Chandu, he says ghosts. ls it true? Ghosts don't exist. They exist! Since you're here, he will be with you. Move aside. Move. - Move. Go away. - Come. He looks like a ghost himself. He tries to teach us. You will see ghosts. You will face them. I'm feeling ashamed to commit suicide myself. When I'm unsuccessful in love, why should I feel ashamed to commit suicide? I have taken a right decision. Wonderful room. Fantastic. Why did you close the door? I'm getting scared. Why are you looking at me like that? Don't come to me. I'm getting scared. I'll scream. Aishu! Chandu! Let them do their work and we will do ours. I've been resisting all these days. I can't wait anymore. I have to show and you have to see. - Don't touch me. - Come. Look. Look, you eyed on my shirt in the morning. Now, why are you eyeing my underwear? Your intentions are bad. Think whatever you want. Let it be between us. Nobody should find out. I can't wait anymore. My mind is blocked. I have to show it to you. Look at me. Please. - No. - Look at me. Look! - No! Here. Take a good look. My head is itching. Wig? - Yes. Oh. - You idiot. You have hair, why did you wear a wig? There is a big story behind it. My girlfriend Gauri.. ...fell in love with me seeing this wig. Hence, I'm taking good care of it. - Hey you. But she ditched you. - So what? Ifl die without the wig.. "What if she thinks it is not me seeing the newspaper? My death will become meaningless. Hence, I'm taking care of this wig past eight years. - You fool. Go. You stink. Go and have bath. Go. Not I, the wig is sticking. It's been a week since I washed it. I will have bath and come. Let's sleep together. - Go. God. Let's have bath together. - Go away. Ifl go with him to the bathroom, he will turn bathroom to bedroom. I have to be careful. Don't sleep. People are not trustworthy. Sir, I wonder why they came here. We were happy that junior sir won't be coming to the guesthouse. We did whatever we wanted. If they are here, ifs trouble for us. What do we do? What did senior sir say? He called and asked us to take good care of them. Before junior sir comes here.. ...nobody should be here. Within aweek". ...they should move out of this bungalow. Understand? - It is difficult. Hey! Why is it difficult? Call Parvati. - Okay. Whatever we want will happen in this house. Don't worry about it. I guarantee you. But don't annoy me by calling me often. Okay. - Praveen. - He is coming. Okay. - Hey- Hi. - You are talking over the phone when you are about to die? I had taken loan. You know the bank won't spare me. They will come home even after I die. Ifl die without informing them, they will spit on my face. Now, everything is setfled. I needn't pay the loan. You have nothing to give. Torn clothes" "and your life. Correct, buddy. - I'm dying because my girl ditched me.. ...but why do you want to die? - We are actually here.. Chandu, tell us your story first. Let's hear Praveen's story later. We are partners in death. Its better we know about each other. Then tell us your story, Aishu. - Forget me. Tell us your story first. Tell her your story. What do I tell you? I was very happy in life. And then she entered into my life. Chandu. - Yes. I can't come with you for lunch. Why.' You don't like to come with me for lunch? That's not so. - We're marrying in one month.. "Forget about office work. You know I work for my friend's brother. Ifl don't go to work, he doesn't get satisfied. - Oh God. Why does your boss need my fiance? That's not so. - Then what? The company was bankruptcy. "We toiled hard and now it is doing well. Here. Stop. - Here? Though she was engaged to me, she had many boyfriends. She used to buy gifts for them with my money. Wow. Nice. My father was happy when our marriage got fixed. He also prepared the invitation. - Here. Look at the design. - Give it to me. Wow. Naughty. Father is here. I had been to invite my friend" "seeing her photo, he said she was his ex lover". "And that she is dating someone else now. I got angry and scolded him. Since she didn't answer my call, I went to the place where she was. Oh my God. - Thank you, darling. You're fantastic. Chandu. What are you doing? Ifl was late even by one minute, I wonder what would've happened. What would've happened? I would've died. That's all. When my girlfriend ditched me, I better die. I loved her so much. She said she will marry me.. "But romancing with someone else. When I asked her, she says he is her cousin brother. Does anyone hug and kiss a brother in the club? Ifthis continues... "after marriage I might find his sandals outside my house and will have to return. I don't want such a cheap girl. Forget her. Don't marry her. Why do you want to die? All my friends know that I'm marrying her. But she.. she has boyfriends everywhere. The video in which she's romancing with another guy... ...has been uploaded in the internet. Should I marry such a girl? Let's think of another idea. - There is only one solution. Suicide. My love came to an end. I was shattered. I then decided to commit suicide. This is my story. Yours? Mine isn't a story, but scripture. - Old scripture? - Please. Family is involved in this. Mine is an orthodox family. I guess your mother must be preparing good curry. We also perform last rites. Chandu, basically I'm from Chennai. I'm here to do hotel management course. I'm engaged to my maternal uncle. I don't like him . But my mother desires to get me married to him. I said my mother that he was a gay, but she didn't believe me. My fiance lied to everyone that. ...l'm refusing to marry him.. ...since I have a boyfriend. My mother also attempted suicide saying ifl didn't marry him.. "She will die. Hence, I'm here to die thinking all the problems will get solved". ...even before she dies. Aishu! Praveen, what's her fault? Why should she die? Why are you asking me? Ask her. We shouldn't encourage her to commit suicide. She has a bright future. She is a sweet girl. He is getting emotional" Praveen. - Buddy, look.. ...you've decided to commit suicide. Will you change your mind ifl ask you to? Then how will she listen to me? Buddy, please convince her. Go. Hey, go. - Okay. Let me try. Aishu, extraordinary. We can make a film having your story. Your acting was extraordinary than Kalpana. Who is she? - Do you want to know? - No. It's not a story, it's real. My friends called me and asked if theiob is done. He is seeing us. Pretend to cry. I can't. I will say 'I love you' to Chandu. I lied to father that I'm going on a one week tour. Ifl don't make him fall for me in three days, I'm done for. Aishu, continue. - You idiot. There's nothing to continue. I need a topic. Ifl get angry, I will bite you. You had pilaf for lunch. Was it good? It was very tasty, but all the bones were in my plate. You're pretending very well. Continue, I will be back. - Okay. Oh my God. I'm tired. What did she say? She said there were only bones. - Bones? Actually" I'm unable to pacify her. She has decided to die. Oh my God. With great difficulty, I have postponed the suicide for three days. - Why'? Since she likes you very much. Yes. When you said you will die, she is so upset as ifher lover is dying. Just shut up. Even I felt the same. It is difficult to understand the psychology of the girls. They are very emotional. Poor girl. I feel very bad for Aisha. Look at her. - Naughty. Don't look at her. Look at me. I'm talking to you. She doesn't want you to die. The idea hasn't changed.. ...it's been postponed for three days. Show her that life is beautiful. If you fulfill her wish, she will die happily. What? - Three days, right? - Yes, just three days. 0K9!' That's like a good boy. I'm okay too. Excuse me. I need to pee. Where should I do it? His pocket and mouth are free. Do it. Thank you. - Hey. Even your pocket is free. - Go there. He is such a pain. Hey you, Open it. What happened? What dress is this? It was in the closet. I don't know who it belongs to. I wore it. It is good, isn't it? - Haven't your worn underwear? Itis quitelose and.. Forget that. Tell me something. When are we going to die.. "Where and how? You die right away. Our death has been postponed for three days. Oh. Oh my God. Hey. It stinks. You idiot. - That's unfair. We came here together, we must die together and become ghosts together. Let's think about it later. I have work to do. Hello. Are we really going to die after three days? 100 percent. Even if we don't die, we will surely kill you. - Okay. Hey, stop. You said we will die together, now you say you will kill me? Praveen, I have made coffee" ...give it to Aishu. For me? - Make it yourself. I gave the idea to die, I brought you here, but you give coffee only to her? Why? - The coffee will turn cold. Give it soon. I won't give it. You give it yourself. I won't go. You go. You made coffee, so you go and give it to her. I'll do it for you. Idiots. I Iikeit. You're taking bed coffee to her bedroom .. ...you will surely fall in love with her. Naughty. Good morning. - Good morning. "When the rain fell on my body.. ...l wished for you." "When I saw you.. ...there is so much happiness in my eyes." "You look so beautiful." "God is really great." "Get naughty a little bit." "I just love you, baby. You're my heart. Come to me. What shall I do?" "Can you be my baby'? Feel like being with you all the time." "Bright sunshine, shower your ray over me." "Bright sunshine, show me your shine over me." "My heart yearns to be with you.. ...all the time." "I dream of you all the time." Come to me. I will give you my love." "I can't live without you now." "When the rain comes, I will cometo you." "When autumn com es, come to me as autumn." "ln every birth." "My love. Sweetheart. My love." "You're the best girl I have ever met." "There's happiness only after you came into my life." "You're like a love song." "Fill my life with love." "I will give you all my love." "You're the man I wish to marry." "At every birth." Boss, you said you will reform the girl, but you've changed yourself now. Since the girl is close to you, doesn't mean she loves you. They say girl is death. You are going to die, why do you need a girl? IfAishu finds out that you have such feelings.. ...she won't respect you. Hey, look at me. When a girl smiles at you, you just can't go after her. Dirty fellow. No, I will die. Do that first Otherwise if you die.. "After making her fall for you, she will die too. Before you die, ask your inner soul. Now, you are struggling to die, you will struggle even after death. I won't change my mind at any cost. O Lord Jesus. I pay my respects to You. Protect us. After learning that there's current problem in Karnataka" ...you fixed candlelight permanently" "we understand how clever you are. We are waiting to come to you and serve you. What to do? We are not getting travelling visa. America is not giving visa to Modi. You're not giving visa to us. Never mind. At least send us to Pakistan. Though we don't in peace, we will die into pieces. But your peace and harmony.. ...should always be on us. In the name of holy ghost, amen. Hey. - Jesus, did you say something? You idiot, it's me. - Who called me? What's all this? Brother, this is what happens after one dies. If you want to die, you pray to God. my are you involving us? Look, you've been fooling. Tell m e the truth . Are we going to die or not? Maharaja. I don't care about others. But I will surely die with you. Very good. You are so faithful. This is what everyone says. Don't trust anyone. We will die. Be prepared, Maharaja. Aishu, what are you saying? - Yes, Praveen. I'd decided to die yesterday itself" "but we've made an agreement. Be ready. - Okay. Hey! Aishu! Hello. Will you die on your own.. ...or should I become ghost after dying and kill you? Take off your hand. - Idiot. - Idiot. Lord Jesus, they hit nails on you which were visible.. ...but they are hitting nails on mewhich is invisible. How will I live with them? Sorry. How will I die? Oh God. Tell me. Come on,Aishu. I'm planning to make him escape suicide. ...why did you say like that? - Those in love.. ...don'tlisten to us.. ...we should do what they do. Even I did the same. But he has decided to die. Maybe he doesn't like me. You're so adamant. There is no time. What if he dies? - I will die with him. Die. You always say you want to die. You always talk about dying. - Look Praveen.. ...the time that I said to my father is getting over. I don't think I will get my love. I won't tolerate even if Chandu parts from me. I will surely die. Why are you not confident about your love? If you don't get your love, there won't be any meaning to word 'love'. Look, you will surely get Chandu. Have faith. Not on me, on your love. Amavasya. - Yes. What are you doing? I'm making way for Parvati. Go on. Hello. Excuse me. Wait a minute. Stop. - Why? - Yes. It is 2 minutes for 12. Exactly at 12.. What next? As soon as it is 12, we must cut our wrists and die. I don't believe. What if you get scared and drop the plan of dying? What will you do? Will you kill us? I will. - You will go to jail. I don't care. That's what I want. Look, listen to me. If you don't die, I won't spare you. What can you do after you die? Go and sleep. Go away. Even I will go. Hello. You go there. Gauri. My love. I'm going to die today. To attain your love, I promised to prove myself by dying. I'm going to do it today. Look, I'm about to die wearing your favorite wig. Head the newspaper tomorrow" ...you will learn that I'm dead. Be happy. Lord Jesus, I'm going to the world where I cannot return. Let my journey be good. Aishu, what are you doing? Will you get him if you die? I realized I won't get him even if I'm alive. I was close to Chandu for three days" ...butl didn't even a small change. What do I do? I think he doesn't like to see my face. Alright. I will do one thing. Shall I tell him that you love him? I don't want you to force him to love me. If love is true, he will express it himself. Why are you being stubborn? What if he doesn't propose to you? I will die with him. - Why do you say that all the time? You are not here to die, but to change his mind. Don't cry. I have an idea to convince him. Whatis it? What if you and Chandu get committed for 15 minutes? What do you mean? - Kiss him. Kiss? What are you saying? Boys do so many things for love. What's wrong in putling your honor at stake? - Honor? But you said kiss? For girls like you from orthodox families kiss means honor. That's what I meant. Chandu might misunderstand me. The girl in true love puts their honor at stake, kiss.. ...no boy will cheat on her. Our boys so faithful. Look. Aishu. To take such decision in this point of time is not wrong. Say yes. Okay. You go. - Good. Buddy, what are you doing? They always want to die. How is Aishu? Did she do anything to herself? Tell me. - Ask me. You're concerned about her and she's concerned about you. And I have become a messenger. I can't. There's no friendship between you two. No relationship and no love too. But why are you both so much concerned about each other? Shut up. first tell me. If you postpone again, I won't listen to you. I want to die. Die. No one will stop you. But before you die, do a good deed. - What is it? Actually, Aishu has a wish. She was crying thinking it won't get fulfilled. What her wish? She needs a hug, a kiss.. ...sleep with her.. spend 15 minutes with her. This is why you brought me here? Is it your wish or her wish? I have nothing to do with this. Don't say that again. It is her wish. I never had such thoughts on her. Start having now. Buddy. You can't? Alright. I will tell her. - Wait. Just kiss, right? - Yes. You can do many more things with her. - Hey. What rubbish are you talking? - I was kidding. - Praveen. What happened? I have no time. I know you have no time. But he should understand that. Tell me. He will com e. Go. Hurry up. He should finish in five minutes. Okay. He will come. Go. You will go like this? - Yes. Have bath, spray perfume and then do it. Do it? - Yes. - What do you mean? - He doesn't understand anything. I will tell you, come. Did he do something to himself'? Let's go and check. It was I who screamed. You idiots. You said we will die, but you've been fooling me. He is there to do that. Be quiet. Look, don't crack joke while dying. You will kill me and take my body to some engineering college.. - Hey. Not engineering college, medical college. Whatever it maybe. - You only have one thing to sell. Only one thing? What's that? The only thing. - What's that? - Eyes. Don't say that. I feel like crying. You will cry? I will cry with you. - No. Come. - Come. You go, buddy. Maharaja, I will cry with you, come. "L'm waiting for you." "Waiting is also a kind of pleasure." "Fulfill my first wish." "You're the last rays of the sun." "I'm waiting for you." "Waiting is also a kind of pleasure." "You're my honey. Love you, honey. Come to me, baby. Oh baby." "The lamp is about to go off." "I can't wait anymore." "I got washed away in the path of love." "I came running to you to give you my life." "I can't wait anymore." "My dream is right before me." "My body is trembling with fear." "Fulfill my first wish." "Fulfill my first wish." "Waiting is also a kind of pleasure." "Open the door of my heart and see for once." "I have just come close to you." "I can't wait anymore seeing your excitement." "This is the most precious moment of my life." "I surrender myself to you." "Touch me not." "Getting deep into love." "Let's write our love story."

I lied to you about our suicide and brought you here. Aishu has done something which no one else in the world would do to save you. She is a gem who was ready to even mortgage her dignity. Chandu, though she knows that you don't love her.. ...she has been suffering every minute to save you. I know that. Even you should know that. 'Should I be friends with Aishu or not?' 'ls she really a ghost?' 'If she's really a ghost, how can I save her?' 'She is a cute girl.' mere are you taking me? - Come with me quietly. Hi.-Hi,Aishu. Come and have food. - "You are in my heart." Oh buddy" ...you are having food without us? Nothing" He would've called us had he thought us to be his friends. I was hungry, so I was eating. You mean, you are still not satisfied. Hey, you were right. He relishes on food very much. Enough of eating. Serve everyone now. Don't joke with me. You can serve yourself. Have you left something for us. - You stay quiet. Hey, don't change the topic. Answer her question first Nothing Aishu, you have food. Should I feed you? Gauri, did you see? This is love.. to hell with you! - Hey! Sorry.. - You spat on my plate. I made a mistake. - Monkey. Shall I give you another plate? - Okay. Give me. - Take it. Hey Chandu! Hey Chandu! Why did he leave? - I don't know. Aishu.. Hey Aishu! What is wrong with him? I don't know. He was fine. He changes suddenly. Though I go close to him, he goes away from me. He is trying to avoid me. Hey Chandu, why do you do that? You know she is so upset? She is ready to do anything for you, then why are you hesitating? What did she give? - A kiss. Yes right, she really kissed me. She hold my neck and threw me like a sack. - Hey. She is a girl. Did she held you by your neck and throw you? What are you saying? I beg of you, please leave me alone.

Leave me. I won't go. Hey, come on. - Leave me. Listen to me. Leave me, I will be with you. - Go inside. Hey Praveen, don't leave me and go. Open the door! Why did you come here? Go away! You get scared as if you've seen a ghost when you see me. You are avoiding me, aren't you? Get lost! I don't need to talk to you. Aishu, I get scared when you look at me in anger. I'm not angry. My eyes are such. Do you know I have many fans in the college who die for my eyes? But you are.. go, I won't talk to you. No Aishu.. Sorry Aishu.. Maybe it is my problem, but whatever I saw, I felt it was true. Definitely, something is wrong with me. I've been upset since my love failure. Moreover, I've seen death very closely. So..l am scared. Chandu, why fear when Aishu is here? You are not a loser. Forget your past I love you very much. Feel mylove. I love you, Chandu. I love you so much. Hug me, Chandu. Hug me, please. I love you, Chandu. I love you. Move your hands! Move! Aishu? Aishu? You try to fool me by talking sweetly? I hit you and scared you. Wasn't that enough for you? Aishu doesn't know why you are here, but I do. I don't know anything. Scoundrel, you came here to die.. ...you want girl to kiss you? You can't play games with me. Before sunrise.. "Leave this house. I will go away. Please, leave me. If you go near Aishu again" ...l will show your death to you. Do you understand? - I will go. What kind of men you are? If a woman gets angry" ...you will not be spared. Pal, everyone comes to the cemetery after dying.. ...you are sitting here before you die. Come, let's go. - Leave me. What happened? Aishu is possessed. Possessed? What are you saying? She is possessed. When I recall what happened last night, I am sweating profusely. Doesn't one sweat when they work hard? Joking? She showed me hell last night. I don't believe it. How can you believe? Hey, I've seen her so closely. Leave me. Had you gone more closer, you would've died. We've come here to die, right? So, I told you. I don't believe in ghosts or spirits. But I'm unable to die peacefully. I have a soft corner towards her, but I get confused when I see her. Hey Aishu is.. - Aishu is a nice girl. Even I like her. She behaves nicely.. "But when I go closer to her, she changes. I don't know where does that ghost come from? Hey, she is a little girl.

Do you really love him? I'm trying to unite you both" "and you are scaring him. He had ran away with fear seeing your second show last night. I brought him here. You go to him, kiss him.. I mean, hug him and apologize to him. Get him here. I'm telling you to go. Go! Aishu, what is this new avatar? Blacky, I know. He didn't think cheap, but you did. You expect me to apologize to him? What happened to you? - You expect meto kiss him? Your voice has changed. You tell me to be with him for 15 minutes. Are you a friend or a pimp? Iam not Aishu. - Then? I'm a demon for you. You send an innocent girl to kiss a guy? I will do as you say. Jump! You scrub so nicely. Do you have experience? I used to scrub the cows, now I am scrubbing you. You're acting smart. - Praveen! Hey! - Blacky, what's wrong? Why are you standing there? - Hey! He fell!- I told him, but he didn't listen to me. You deserved this. - Hey. Water was so clean, but this black dog fell in it and dirtied it. Oh, change the water. - Okay, boss. Pal, PW!- Chandu, play properly. Are you losing intentionally?

I beg of you, we shall be together all the time. We shall stay together. No matter what we do, let's do it together. Oh God. I thought she was a kid, but she stamped me! She stamped me so much that all my bones.. "Got crushed. Please, leave me. Hey, shut up and sit here. She might come here again. Leave me. - Sleep here. Oh God, I won't sleep facing that side.

Incoming free.. ...do we have to take ghosfs permission if we have to take her along? First try to find out what that ghost wishes? Fulfill that wish. Once the wish gets fulfilled, it will leave her body. Hey, you are an expert in fulfilling wishes, right? Take his help and fulfill that ghost's wish. - Shut up. Don't act smart. Whatever he says is right. Let's follow his instructions. - Boss.. A girl named Kamalawas possessed. She wished to eat food at bar. We brought her food. It ate and left her body.
