Hey, ladies. Hi. College isn't the same without you. Give us a cig, Jo. I've got one left. - Really? - Please? - Fine. - Thank you. All right, listen, we have so much to tell you. There's Dillon. Oi, MySize! Lemon sorbet, bruv. - The guy's there, bruv. - No, I'm getting my lemon sorbet, man. What are you talking... Forget your lemon sorbet. What do you mean, "Forget my lemon sorbet"? I like my lemon sorbet, bruv. Nobody makes lemon sorbet like Mr Cappuccino, get me? He didn't even look at me, just you three. What? He was looking at all of us. No, it was you three. - I've got a man. - Out of luck with me. - Well, Jo's in luck, then. - Please, you're the one who likes him. - Do I need to do any work? - No, I'm not handing mine in till Monday. That's right, I forgot. You're off to see cyber lover boy. I'm going to my audition. When Sir Jago Larofsky moves to Europe, he's only taking on three students and I want to be one of them. Whatever. Have you skyped with Brett, by the way? He doesn't have Skype. So, tell me, do your parents actually know that they're paying for their baby girI to snare her first catch in the penis flytrap? - No. - Or in layman terms "get fucked"? What the fuck you thinking, blud? You like ladies handbags, yeah? Oh, my God. Kerrys, come on! Kerrys. Fuck, yeah. Where's my bag? Cass, this is yours. Jesus, you guys carry way too much stuff. Don't look up my skirt. You're lucky I don't cable tie you. - Why are you carrying cable ties? - Just in case. I'll show you. What is it with you men? You just want, want, want. If it's not what's in our purses, it's what's in our pants, or a piece of everything else we're better at than you. They've called the police. Want me to take over? Cheers. See, Cass? And you, remember one thing when they're arresting you, yeah? You ain't getting this, I don't cook, and girls rule, bitch. Hey, I think these are your keys. Thanks. All right, ball-bag? Let's see how you like looking up my skirt. So, Kerrys, when's the driving test? Tomorrow. Then it's gonna be Kerrys Hamilton. No, Button. No, wait, Hamilton. And are you seriously gonna lose it to Brett? Yeah, of course. Great, you can all talk about it while I just gather dust. At least you've had sex. Not like Mother Teresa over here. - By choice, Jo. - Yeah, well, I wish I hadn't. Yeah, agreed. Men are overrated, babe. Wait, so if Brett doesn't have Skype, have you even seen a picture of him? Yes, of course. Like that's what he really looks like. I bet he's gonna be a sweaty, old pig. What do your parents think you're doing when you're not auditioning? Staying with Annie. And they believe that? - Yes. - Don't push me. It's the police, man. Let's go. You'd never have won the war without us. Which war's that? The one on drugs or terror, 'cause... What are you guys doing? Move, man. Get off me! - I dropped one, man. I dropped one, man. - Hey, what you doing? Go away. - Shit! - No, no, no. Come on, this way. This way. You know, if you never talk to him, it's never gonna happen, and he's a great guy. Shaz, just wait like I did. Seriously, Mr Right will come along eventually. And if you can't find Mr Right, - get Mr Vibrator. - Mr Vibrator. - Oh, no. Let's go, come on. Speaking of men, don't forget, it's my brother's birthday party on Sunday. Got loads of family coming, and I think I'll go nuts if you lot ain't there. - Wish me love. - Love, bitch. Bye, guys. Doors closing. Just sit down. Just talk to me. Please... - No, I've said... I've made up my... Please, please. Is someone gonna tell me what's happening? I'm leaving. - What do you mean? - Did you not read my note? I put a note in your bag. It explains everything. What note? I just can't do this any more. - Bye, Jack. - Lauren, no... No, Mum, wait. What note? What did you do? What did you do? Armed with inside knowledge and a taste for the spectacular, a gang of thieves managed to pull off the biggest gem theft that Antwerp, the diamond cutting capital of the world, has ever suffered. The operation reads like a film script, but, police say, it was conducted with no melodrama. No shoot out, no screeching tyres and no blood. Is Jo home? Jo, your weird mate's here. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry, I'm in a rush. - Are you okay? - No. Is it about that boy stuff? Look, babe, they're not worth it. - Really. - No, it's not about that. You didn't come here to borrow my... - No... That... No. - Okay, good. Well, then, what is it? 'Cause I really gotta go. - My mum... - Gwen, you fucking bitch, - did you take my hair ties again? No, bitch, I didn't. Look, Shan, I've really gotta go. What do you want? I just need to talk to someone. - Can we talk tomorrow? - No, I need to talk to you now. Sit down. Sit down here. Hey, listen, I don't want no fucking attitude from you. Look, bruv, I got family over. I can't have them in my house long. - I can't risk being involved. - It's one night. You're like a fucking child, man. All right, listen, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna do what I tell you, you understand me? Huh? Yeah. Hey, are you my sister's mate? Yeah, hi. What the fuck are you doing down there? Nothing. Come on, man. I got to go to work. Come on, man. Dickhead. - Yeah, three triple vodkas, please, mate. Yeah, no worries, man. Here, shoot that. You'll feeI better. And the other one. So, what are you doing tonight? Whatever you wanna do. I'm kind of horny. I was thinking we could go back to my yard and press flowers. - Kerrys, where's that guy? - Gone. What the fuck are you doing? Are you nuts? I'm over there with Jas and I saw him feeling you up so I came over. What, am I not allowed to get felt up now? I wanted to go back to his place. You're drunk, he's a dickhead. You don't want nothing from that guy. Trust me. I haven't drunk that much. I think it's time for you to go home, babe. I just wanted to go home with that guy. Jesus! - Jo won't talk to me, my mum has just... - What are you talking about? I'm gonna kill you two bitches. - I thought he wanted to shag me. - He changed his mind. Let's go. - Come on. - Kerrys. I feeI sick. Shit. Hide. Go on, hide. It's me. They're gone. Come on. What happened? One minute everything was fine. - Why did he chase after us? - Who knows? Look, if we could figure men out, we'd be millionairesses. Slumdog millionairesses. No? Okay, I think you should go home, babe, yeah? - I'll call you in the morning. - Wait. When I was with you earlier, did you see a note anywhere? A note? From who? Do you want a lift? No. Thanks. - Shit! - Oh, fuck! - Hi, Cass, it's Shannon. Hello, Shannon, how are you? - How's it going in New York? - Yeah, it's great. - Look, Shannon, i've got to go... - Did you see a note anywhere? A note? No, sorry. - Okay, but it's quite important. - i've got to go, Shannon. There were cameras, sophisticated alarms, on every main entrance and exit. Suspicions and allegations are now surfacing that it was an inside job, masterminded to rid the vaults of the blacklisted blood diamonds. Ben Shepherd, News Central One, Antwerp. Do you blame me, Dad? No. No, no, it's your mum's fault. I feeI like it's me. Mum left, Jo's sister says I'm weird and Jo wouldn't talk to me. I called Cass last night and she wouldn't even talk to me, either. And Kerrys, we've known each other since we were kids and... - Listen, it's not your fault. - It must be. That's why none of them will talk to me. That's why no man wants to... It's like they all know what I did and none of them will come near me. Sweetie, come here, darling. You know what? Fuck all of you! - You didn't call me. - Go away, Shannon. Why are you looking at me, blud? Look down on the floor. It's there. I'm showing you, fam. Shit, man. - Have you lost a diamond? - Blud, just shut your mouth. I didn't lose nothing, blud. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Excuse me? Sorry, yeah, but where do I know your face? Wait up. Hello? What you saying, Tee? What, today? Yeah, I can be there a little later, still. Look, I'll get them back now. Yeah, them man are here. Look, don't worry, man, I'll make you look decent. All right, well, I'll be there, all right? - Yeah. Where do I know you? - I live near you. I saw you here yesterday, running. Jo? I thought you weren't talking to me? - I don't know. Did you see a note yesterday? - No, i didn't see... Okay, I'll see you later. So, listen, yeah, I've got to kick. I've got a couple of things to do, so I'm going to be straight up. You're not usually my type of gash, but there's something about you. I'm thinking that me and you should link up and do a little thing. You get me? Not really, no. I'm saying that I think you're nice. Give me your number, innit? Safe. - Blud, what you chatting to her for? - It's a press, innit? She calls it art, I call it dirt. - Hi, Jo. - Hey. Look, I can't talk right now. Can you leave? You just asked me to come here. And now I'm asking you to leave. I just want to talk to you. Why are you being like that? - Can you just go? - Why? Because she's here with her man. She doesn't want you here. Fuck you. What are you saying, babe? Please don't. You won't believe the shit couple of days I've had. Yeah? Well, it's about to get worse. Come on, man, what are you doing with this lock? Get hold of her. Get hold of her. Hold her, hold her, hold her. Give me the bag. Give me the bag. Take that phone. It's shit, bruv. That's all she's got. I want it. - Is that blood? - Paint, I think. Don't get it on the seats. Nice place. So, look, the bathroom's through there. Why don't you freshen up? Here's some clean clothes. Looks like we have the same style. Then I'll take you home. Thanks. Really, this is so nice of you. People rarely do good things these days. So, what do you do? Actually, I'm just starting up a new business. Oh. - That's cooI. Doing what? - It's an import export thing. Right. Well, what stuff do you import? What stuff do you import and... - What are you doing? - Where are the Pringles? They're just crisps. I can get you some if you want. Where are the fucking diamonds that were in the Pringles box? What diamonds? Open the fucking door. Listen, bitch! If you want to live, you'll open this door right now. Just tell me where they are and I'll let you go. A lot of people have worked very hard for this. Okay, okay. Just back away and promise me you're not going to hurt me. I promise. Come here! it's Jo, do it. Jo, I don't know what the fuck is going on, but I think I got some stolen diamonds from your shop. So can you just give me a call? Hello? Kerrys. Cass found what? - Where's mum? - Do you know what? I've changed my mind, right? It's all your fault. All of this. All of this is your fault. Sorry. Auntie Sandy left a forwarding address on the telly. Oh, shit. Are you going to bring her back? Why would I do that? Doors closing. - Shannon, how did you... - How about, "How are you?" You wanna know? I had my phone stolen, I've been mugged, I was chased by police. I was then lured into an apartment where I was almost killed for something I know nothing about, and none of my friends will talk to me for longer than 30 seconds to listen. Shannon, this is CarI. Fuck CarI! I'm sure you don't need me to tell you how to do that. I wrote you a note to avoid a scene like this. Well, I didn't get it. This is the happiest I've been since before you were born. I supported you. You made me get rid of her. It was your choice. - You made me think it was. - We talked about it. You talked about it. You were only ever thinking about how it was going to affect you. Everything was about you. I stayed in that marriage for you. You've never noticed my scars, Mum? Got loads of family coming, and I think I'll go nuts if you lot ain't there. - Wish me love. - Love, bitch. Bye, guys. You can't just come into my flat whenever you want. As long as your father and I pay the mortgage I can. I'm here to make sure everything's set and you're ready to go. Do you have to be involved in everything I do? - This audition is your future. - You're suffocating me. Are your father and I going with you? I've got some money for you. Get something for your father. Cigars or wine or something he'll like. Have you decided on your music, yet? - Yes, Dad. - And you put the time in on it? Yes, Dad. Don't let your mother stress you out. You know, she only wants you to do well. - She was never as good as you, you know? - Yeah. That's no reason for back chat, though. There's a certain standard of behaviour expected from you, young lady. - You understand? - I know. - Kerrys. Hey! - Hey, Cass. Open the glove box. It's for... You know, just in case. Also, get a couple of gifts for your mother. You know, one of those designer handbags or perfume or a souI. Yeah, something. - Surprise her. - From the start, we said he would make all the big decisions, and I would make all the small ones. And in 20 years of marriage, we're happy to say that there have been no big decisions yet. Bye. Cunt! Miss? Ma'am, is that your bag? Because I'm gonna be sitting there. - Sorry. - Don't worry, no worries. - Excuse me, Miss. Is he with you? - No. Oh, man, this is always the most awkward part. Hey, easy, paI. Excuse me. - Excuse me. Some people are so rude. Oh, my God. Sorry. Sorry. Man, he's out cold. That's a reaI bummer for me 'cause I was hoping to sit in the aisle seat, you know? Would you mind switching seats terribly? I know me. We're going to get up in the air in about 15 minutes from now. I'm a nervous flier. I'm gonna have to drop the kids off at the pooI, which is a very American way of saying, "I'm gonna need to poop. " So, it would be better if I was on the aisle, because "poop break. " - Can I... Can we switch? - Yes. Thanks, man. You rock. You're so cooI. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Just sit down, already. Still alive! I'm glad 'cause when I went cheek to cheek with him on the cross, I almost cut one. My name's Larry, by the way. Friends call me Big Larry. I've no idea why. I'm just kidding. I know why. Look at me. - What's your name? - Cassandra. This is going to be fun. Drink. Not many people have the soundtrack to Prime Suspect, but I was a huge fan. It didn't really have a beat you could dance to though, but it brings back pleasant memories of... Miss, here's your meaI. - There you go. And, sir. Thank you. Is there cheese in here? 'Cause a pinhead of blue sends me into shock and then I need an adrenalin shot and blah, blah, blah, blah... - No problem. - Wait, wait. Oh, no, no, no. You know what? I'll take it if she's not gonna eat it. Thank you. Cheers. No. Let me tell you, it's one of the things I've learned. So, if you give the food back, it's like Branson wins again. A multi-multi-billionaire. Best to just eat the food. Plus, I could use this, man, I've got a big job. - What do you do? - I'm a stripper. Erotic dancer. I'm just kidding. I don't do any of that. I work for IPS, the InternationaI ParceI Service. - You've probably heard of us. - No. I'm the guy who basically takes a package, brings it right to you and puts it in your hands. I tell all my clients, I'll put it in their hands, I'll put it in their mouth, I'll put it right in their ass. Well, I don't... I'm sorry. I would never say that to the ladies. I'm coming right back tomorrow. Can you believe that? It's just like... Go over, grab these papers, somebody sign them. Come right back. For that, you'd imagine they'd put me up in first class with a little more leg room and whatnot, but, no. I'm going to be honest with you, Cass. One thing I've learned in this life, if you bend over and let people fuck you in the ass, guess what happens? - They fuck you in the... - They fuck you in the ass. Absolutely. - You want a cracker? - Yeah, sure. - Hello. - Hi, Cass, it's Shannon. - Shaz. Hi. - How's it going in New York? Yeah, it's great. Look, Shaz, I've got to go. - Did you see a note anywhere? - A note? No, sorry. I've got to go, Shaz. - Okay. - Sorry. Bye. - Hey, Cass. - Hey, Jo. what's wrong? Calm down. - He didn't come. - Did you try calling him? - I've tried. - well, what do you mean he didn't answer? - Are you sure it's the right number? - Yeah, it's the right number. What do you think I should do? where are you? - I'm in that place that looks like Piccadilly. - Times Square? All right, do you have cash and a credit card? Yeah. I've got money and credit cards. You know what? Fuck him. Go shopping, have fun, and then book a flight home, okay? Okay, I'll do that. - Bye. - Bye. Yeah, Sunday morning. VA21. Thanks. - Oh, my God. - Yeah, sorry I'm late. I... Wow. - Looks like you were expecting me. - These... I didn't think you were coming. I don't even know what to say. Don't say anything. I mean talking's cooI, but I don't think either of us are here to do that. This is going to be so romantic. I know. How about we celebrate your first time? It was good, right? Lie with me. I got to take a piss. You sound different. Do I? Maybe it's just the sex and alcohoI talking. Yeah. But when you type, you... Oh, man, that feels great. Yeah. You... You don't get jet lag going east to west, do you? Oh, God. Brett? I hate dreams. What did I eat? Where the fuck's all my stuff? Oh, God. Fuck. Jesus. Oh, my God. What? Thank God I found it. Good morning. Can you tell me how to get to that address, please? Sure. Oh, Lord. Cassandra? - Hey, man. - Thanks for coming. I see New York's treating you the way it treats most of us. What happened to your pants, kid? Look, this letter needs to get back to London. Yeah. I can totally do that. That's what I do, you know? That's my gig. So, I got a delivery tomorrow, anyway. Drop the boss's package off and get this to where it's going. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay. You're a good guy. Well, thanks. You know my mom always said that I had a certain thing that... Hey, Cass? Don't let anybody fuck you in the ass. Sorry. I said we should have gone to France. Yes. I said to you... Okay. You can do this, Cass. Just see if it's him, and then call the police. Cassandra? Who are you? - Calm down, now. - Who are you? I'm Brett. Please don't do this. So what you did to me was fine, but I can't do this. I love you. - You're obsessed. - It's love. All the e-mails, all the sweet words, that was me. Why would you do this? I just wanted to see you. He said he'd fix it, that you'd never know. He was only supposed to take pictures. Pictures? Where are they? He hasn't brought them yet. Call him, now. At one time, it was estimated that one in six diamonds was a conflict diamond. The kimberley Process has brought to light that the purchase of black market diamonds from this or any other illegal source endorses an industry that would otherwise happily flourish without it. Diamonds may be expensive, but they shouldn't cost lives. Susan Sanders, CNT. "Cassandra's home movies"? Where did you get this footage of me? I hacked into it. - I fell in love with you, arsehole. - Yes, with me. Shut up! Kerrys? What the fuck are you doing there? What? - Four, three, two, one. That's a stupid code. Yeah, a stupid code for a stupid fucking girI. "Cassandra's live feed. " Kerrys. God. Dude, we hit the fucking jackpot, man. I got pictures of her asshole. Dude? Dude, seriously, what the fuck? Naked Cassandra. Dude, it's me. i made a video, too. Hey, look, look. This is what they call an English rose. i call it pussy. And, dude, here, check it out. it's talking. Check it, i'm a ventriloquist. Shit. Mister Larofsky? I'm so sorry I'm late. - Cassandra Phillips? - Yeah. I've had the worst... Before you attempt any sob story to tug at my heartstrings, I've held a rule the last three decades. As you young people say, if one snoozes, one loses. Please. I haven't snoozed. You missed your opportunity. Now my wife and I are on the way to dinner. Please excuse us. To the Blue Water Grill, please. Mine are nearly broken. How you doing, man? I think I'm nearly free. We shouldn't have done this. What if she kills us? Dude, she's British. They don't even know how to use a gun. Shit. What did you do to me? I didn't do nothing. Jesus. You jumped on me. Why are you doing this? What are you going to do to us? And why the fuck have you got cable ties? Why am I doing this? Because you took my virginity. And then you took my shopping, and I'm really not happy about that. And by the way, I erased those pictures you took of me, so now we're going to see how you like it. - No, no, no, no. No, no... - Is that all you've got? Oh, God, I'm sorry, okay? - Please, God, stop taking photos. - It's quite cute. No wonder it was over so bloody quickly. Come on. Please, just stop, okay? I will not get fucked in the arse. Really, I'm so sorry... What? Get off me, you bastard. Get off me. I love you. I fucking love you. Where are you going, huh? Hey, let her go. Mind your business, bitch. What the fuck you say? I said take you black ass inside. Look, eat some chicken or some watermelon and mind your damn business. I think you better let her go. Now, I take it you don't want this soon to be ass-whipped little bitch pulling on your hair? No. Take your little ass home. We gonna deaI with him. What are you gonna do? Well, first I'm gonna teach him respect for women. Then I'm gonna have my cousins here talk to him about raciaI stereotypes like assuming that all black people eat watermelon and chicken. After that he's gonna understand that although my ass is black, he ain't got the right to signify that shit to me like I didn't already know it. That's gonna be a hard lesson. Why don't you tattoo him while you're at it? What do you want it to say? Oh, um... Something short like, "I used to pretend to be someone else to have sex with girls. "Then I got caught and had pictures taken of my tiny penis, "and every day I look in the mirror I will remember how lucky I am "just to have this tattoo as my revenge. " - Okay. - Thank you. Come on. Come on, guys. Guys, guys. Come on, come on. I voted for Obama. Hey, Cass? Kerrys, 5:00 am. i take about... - I hope you cleaned up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you get the note that Shannon's mum left? - Yeah. - I know. - I didn't have her address. - All right, bye. Please... - Yeah, see you later. what the heck is going on? - wait. Sure. Okay, he's ready to... What? What... What could you possibly want at this time in the morning? Hey, hey. Oh, God. Despite interrupting my Sunday rest, you countered your tardiness with invention. This leaves me to judge you purely on your impromptu performance, which, if honest, was brilliant. You have your place next year. Now leave, before I call the police. "Where's Shaz, not at her place, do you know?" - Hey, Jo, hi. - Cass, you're here? Yeah, I'm back. Look, I think I might know where Shaz is. where? Six years with us and you don't know her place doesn't mean her home? we'll come pick you up. Yeah, sure. So, where the fuck are you? Wish me love. Love, bitch. Bye, guys. I think I left my clothes under there. Do you wanna help me find them? - What? - Kerrys? Will you come downstairs and say hello to your grandparents and aunts? It's a long way from BraziI and they're waiting to see you. They're here to see ManueI and Lewis. They don't even like me. Just come downstairs, please. Also, no silly business in the house. Your... Your friend, she said she was just coming upstairs to wait. It's fine. Just go in. - What do you want? - You, innit? Fuck off. Here. - What do I do? You keep them here till tomorrow. When it calms down and I get the call, I'll come pick them up. All right. Get back inside. Did you see her titties, blud? They was out, like, pow! What was that about? Fuck it. - Hey! - Hey! Everyone, this is Jas. Kerrys, why you wear this top? It shows your boobs. They're not boobs, Dad. They're breasts. Boobs are stupid people or mistakes. These aren't mistakes. They're there for a reason, to feed babies. Like you'll ever be doing that. - Kerrys, change your T-shirt. - Fuck. You embarrass me. Again. Happy? ManueI, can I borrow your car? Jas wants to give me a lesson. No. I'm meeting someone. Fucking arsehole. What is mean, "vagetarian"? Help the homeless, girls. Do you wanna buy an issue? - Hey! - Hey, Cass. I've got a present for you. Do you want it? You should never say no to a gift. Thank you, Cass. Wow! Reports have been coming in that the diamonds could be in the hands of a low-level British gang, believed to be working for a middleman transporting the stones to their anonymous buyer. - So, did Cassandra say this was cooI, yeah? - Of course, babe. All the years we've been friends, she weren't going to say no, was she? Look, we've got two days to enjoy, so just sit back and relax, yeah? Do you think in that case maybe we could watch something other than the news? So, you ready for your test tomorrow? Yeah. Do you want some Climagra? It's like Viagra, but jelly. It makes you mega-horny, though. Go on, then. I'm pretty horny, anyway. I don't see what difference it will make. How rich is this girI? So, do you think you'll ever go back to men? I don't know. I'm with you. Okay, but if you had to suck a guy off to save my life, what would you do? Buy you nice flowers for your funeraI. Do you want to go Blam Bar later? Much later, though. Why? I think I've got a hard-on. Got a present for you. Do you want it? What you saying, babes? What, you don't like what you see, no? It's like that. You know what, I'm a sex bomb, you know? Yeah, I'd like to give you my finger. Come, man. Hey, babes, you don't like me, no? Dark chocolate, with nuts! You know what I mean, she's on it. - Hey, babes. - She's on it, man. She's on it. Do the thing. Do the thing. Isn't that what they're really doing, though? Yeah. - Hey, yo, babes. Are you seeing it, though? - Can I join you? - Why don't you fuck off? - Do you kiss your mum with that mouth? - No, but I kissed yours. No, no, babes... Excellent. Come on. Where are we going, babe? Wait here. Wait. What are you doing tonight? Do you want to dance, babe? Yeah. So, why don't you fuck off over there and dance on your own so I can talk to my friend? Whatever you wanna do. Well, I'm kind of horny. Jo won't talk to me and my mum is... What are you talking about? Shit. What did you say to my mate? Shit. Take the fucking piss. I'll kill you two bitches. Go on, hide. Yeah, when I catch you, I'm going to show you what a reaI man's all about. Why does it always come down to that with you men? Honestly, you couldn't keep up with me. It'd be over in a second and you'd be like, "Babes, I'm sorry. " - Listen, bitch... - To tell you the truth, you need a pussy and a pair of tits to get with me. Actually, looking at you and your two friends there, you might have a chance. It's me. They're gone. A note? From who? Do you want a lift? No, thanks. You are so bad. But I fucking love it. Take a right. This is 'cause of last time, ain't it? If you are referring to the incident where we ended up on a new roundabout surrounded by a cloud of dust, which put me in a neck brace for three days. No. This had nothing to do with that. Left. What are you doing? This is dangerous, what you are doing. - It's not dangerous. - Yeah? You have failed. What do you mean, I've failed? How can you faiI me again? - Why are you failing me all the time? - Again, you have failed. Calm yourself. - Calm yourself. Calm yourself, young lady. - What are you doing? It's my car. Stop it. You need to go to church. - You need to study your bible, yeah? - Go church? And talk to Jesus. Talk to Jesus. Get your hands off my chest. - Pervert. - What? Hey, Jo, it's Kes. I failed. I'll tell you about it when I see you. All right, bye. Congratulations. I didn't pass, and I got banned from that test centre. - Figures. - ManueI. You know no daughter of mine should behave like this. No daughter of yours would. Why you say these things? Why can't you be more, you know... What, more like this arsehole? Doing his little dodgy dealings that you never seem to notice. Hey, half breed. You better keep your fucking mouth shut about anything you've seen me do. What's your problem? You hate me that much 'cause we've got different dads? Or are you just jealous 'cause I get more girls than you? No matter how bad you think you are, you still have to squat like a bitch to take a piss. You know what? Fuck all of you. - You didn't call me. - Go away, Shannon. ...which was used as a conduit for diamonds mined by the rebel group the RUF during the war in Sierra Leone, which was responsible for the deaths of at least 50,000 people. Men. So far, more than 200,000 lives have been lost in Liberia as a result of the conflict. Hi, babe. Come lie down. Kes, I've brought someone. He came to see me at work, and look, I think you two should talk. So, this is Cass' flat. Nice. Should get me in there. What the fuck, Jas? What the fuck you doing bringing him here? Hey, calm down. - What do you want? - I came here to make peace. I promised Mum and Dad I'd come over and say sorry. Fine, now go. Yeah, they wanna do a whole big happy family bullshit thing for my birthday tomorrow, so here I am. We both know it'll go a lot better if I ain't there. True. - Hey! - Give it to me. Calm it. - She's got a panic room. - Oh, my God. I can't believe it, a panic room. - Sick. I know. - A bit like James fucking Bond. Be carefuI, babe. I read about this shit ever since that stupid film came out. - Toilet, TV, phone. - Even I'm impressed. It's like a giant fucking mini bar. - This is wicked. - Look at the shoes though, babe. - These are banging. Look. - What are they? - Oh, my God, they're Gino, yeah? - It's pretty cooI. Yep. Oh, my God, these are really hot, you know. ManueI! - Fucking bitches, see you. - Don't be... No! Suck my dick! who's your fucking daddy now, you fucking whores? He really is an arsehole. Yeah, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got them. No, no, no. I ain't at home. I'm somewhere much better. Can't you just call Cass? I can't call Cass 'cause I stole her keys, all right? Dillon, you're late. I don't like it. You're late. I should say that shit. You're late. Did you really need to do that? What? I drank a lot. I needed to pee. We're in love, this shouldn't even be an issue. Where's the porn? Porn. He's up. You got the things, yeah? They all there? Do I look stupid? Raas! - Man, whose place is this? - It's no one important. Hey, you boys know anyone who wants to party today, you send them here, yeah? Yeah. Come on, let's go. Shit. Fuck. What was that about? I don't know. Come on, Kerrys, think. Birthday. I can't believe you stole her keys. - I was thinking of us. - Jealous. - Sure you were. - What's that supposed to mean? He's gone. How are we gonna get out now? I'll crack this thing if it's the last thing I do. I'll just start from the beginning, innit? Zero, zero, zero, one. No. Zero, zero, zero, two. No. You awake? No. What's them vibrations? My will to live disappearing. Probably planes. Flight path, innit? Can you just call Cass, please? And say what? Sorry, but I stole your flat for the weekend. And I'm locked in your panic room? Yes, yes, yes. Shit. Oh, God. This is your fault. You brought him here. My fault? We wouldn't be here if you could have a decent conversation - with your dad without mouthing off. - He's not my dad. Then why do you wind him up all the time - and make him shout at you like he is? - Because I wish he was. Give me the phone. - Hi, Cass. You all right? Long story, but I'm kind of locked in your panic room. - what the fuck are you doing there? - I stole your keys. - what? - Code please? Four, three, two, one. That's it? That's a stupid code. Thanks, bye. Four, three, two, one. Can you believe it? Now to get these fuckers out. Get out. Kerrys, sword, a bit dangerous, no? Out, get out. Move. Get out. Get out. Move. Get out. Now! Hey, Cass. What time's it in New York? i hope you cleaned up. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's spotless. - Did you get the note? - Note? Oh, yeah, read it. I read it. It's wow, it's... Yeah. - Yeah, see you later. - All right, bye. Hello? - Shaz, it's me. I just heard from Cassandra. Yeah, she says she's got a note from your mum? But she sent it to me. Bye. Kerrys? It's your brother's birthday. Sorry, Dad. Well, what have I done to deserve this? When you do these things, it hurts. I want you to love me, Dad. I just... I want to know that when you look at me, you don't see an embarrassment. You see your daughter. We had ManueI when we were young. I was a bad husband. So, your mother, she left me, and when I saw her again, a year later, she was already pregnant with you. The other guy, your biologicaI father, he was gone. But I knew that I had been a fooI. I was at your birth. I am your reaI father. And you are my little girI. Come here. Just promise me you'll be a good girI. I will, Dad. Starting next week. Ah... - Hi, Jo. Are you with Shannon? - No, why? - i fucked up. - What did you do? - You don't wanna know. We should probably find her. She ain't gonna be too happy when she reads the note her mum wrote her. if anything happens to me... What do you mean if something happens to you? - ... it's some guy named Tee. - Who's Tee? Gotta go, babe. No, he's an adult now. Let's just do this for Mum and Dad, yeah? Everyone, everyone. I'm gonna say a few words for ManueI's birthday. Me and my brother, we don't always get along, but I wanted him to know that deep down I love him. Happy birthday, ManueI. Cheers. Cheers. I ain't drinking this. I ain't stupid. No, but you are predictable. Where's my stripper? ...and she was on the phone for ages. Like, I do feeI sorry for her and everything, but it's been like six... Hi, it's Shannon. Leave a message. Shannon, it's Kerrys. Call me back. Where do you think she is? I don't know. Everyone is getting really worried. Look, babe, I'm sorry about bringing ManueI over. - I really... - It's all right. I've sorted him out. Actually, I was expecting something to happen right about... I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's happening! I haven't done anything wrong. - I don't know what's going on. - What is wrong with you? Clear your mind. Come here. Clear your mind. - Okay, it's clear. - Clear your mind. What is wrong with you, ManueI? You have to make it... I'm gonna kill you. Not with that, I hope. Jas, I'm gonna go see Jo. Don't you fucking dare! Stop! You fucking dare. I'm warning you. My dick. My head. Perfect. Struggle and I'll snap it off. For fuck's sake, it's bleeding. That was easily the nastiest thing - I've ever touched. - My dick is bleeding. Maybe second. - I'm gonna fucking kill you, Kerrys. - It's just till you calm down. - You're dead. You are fucking dead. - I hope that's not his dick he's banging with. Kerrys. For goodness sakes. I said next week, Dad. I love you, Jas. Love you, too. I'm going to fucking kill you. You're fucking dead, you fucking lesbian. My dick is bleeding. My dick... You're dead. You are... - Kerrys. Fucking pull the fucking car over. - ManueI, ManueI stop it. - You're fucking crazy. - ManueI. ManueI. ManueI, are you... - CooI. - Kerrys, what the fuck? Are you hurt? Are you okay? Here. Hold on. Here. Take my keys and go get in my car. Okay? - Right, okay. - Oh, fuck. Kerrys, what the fuck is going on? Not much. In a sentence, I've been locked in a panic room, stole my brother's car, probably alienated my whole family, crashed into your work and found this gun. Oh, and Shannon's still missing. How was your day? Fuck! Love, bitch. Bye, guys. Gwen, no. I don't wanna hear who you're giving head to. I don't find this acceptable. Your behaviour, your language... - What happened? What does it look like? Dad's done his leg in. Why didn't anyone call me or text me or e-maiI me or tweet me or whatever? Why didn't any of you contact me? You were meeting the girls. We didn't want to disturb you, honey. - Drink your tea, hon. - Thank you. Wait, how did this even happen? He slipped at the site. Thank God, we've got private. He got hurt doing something he wasn't supposed to be doing. It says no climbing for a reason. Wait a sec. Are you still gonna get paid? It's construction, honey. No work, no pay. Now, his ligaments are gone, which will probably mean he'll be out for, like, three months. Which is why I wanna talk to you girls. With me between contracts, one of you girls is gonna have to work nights at the mart. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, I have already called Barry to let him know one of you is coming. - Mom. - I know you don't like it, but it's gonna be treble pay and we're gonna need the money. Yeah, well, I'm not doing it. - Jo hasn't worked for months. - Is this how much your girls love your dad? Gwen, I am surprised at you. And Jo, when our families joined in matrimony, we became one family, - and I am hurt... - Okay, fine. Fine, fine. I will work tonight, but I am not working tomorrow. Thank you. Well, it's 5:00 to 1:00 a. m., so you better get ready. Jo, your weird mate's here. Hey. Hey. Sorry, I'm in a rush. - What I just said was... - Hey, what's her name again? Shannon. All right, okay. - Has she always looked like that? - She was the one... Don't talk with your mouth full. She's experimenting. Gwen, you bitch. Did you take my fucking hair ties again? No, bitch, I didn't. Will you two stop swearing? You sound like fucking yobs. What do you want? - Can we talk tomorrow? - No, I need to talk to you now. You all right, Jo? What are you doing here? Stepdad, minus sense, plus acting his shoe size rather than his age, equals torn knee ligaments and me spending my entire summer filling shelves. Yay! - Who's working tonight? - Cedric, me, you, Ron and Tee. Who's Tee? Angelo, would you go down and get some stock on the Jack DanieI's? And the snacks aisle is looking skinny. I thought Gwen was coming? She couldn't, so you get me. Well, update, Jo. Cedric isn't coming to the 1:00 a. m. shift, so I need you to work all night. Problem? - No. - Right. I'm off. The kids are camping, thank fuck, so I get a night with the wife. Right. Tee's in charge. Terence. Hey. Hey, hey. So, what's your name, sweetness? Sweetness? Wow. Does that... Does that work for you ever? Yeah, you'd be surprised. Okay, well my name is not sweetness, I can assure you that. It is Joanne. Right, well, I've never seen you on a late shift before, Joanne. I usually work Saturday, 9:00 till 4:00, but haven't worked in a while, but, you know, got to feed those kids, right? No, I'm kidding. I don't have... I don't have kids. I mean, I'm kid free. Everything's all un-pushed-a-kid-out-like. I'm just gonna stop talking. Right, so you know your jobs today, yeah? - I'm here to work, so whatever. - Good. Good. Good. So, clean the staff toilets and the customer toilets, then sweep and mop the floor. Then do a stock check and stock shelves 1 to 12. Start new displays for the items that aren't selling well in the places I've marked. Re-price the King Size Snickers and cash out register one and work on register two, which we'll rotate untiI morning. Great. Oh, and hang up my jacket. Angelo? Where the fuck is that boy? Angelo? Hey, Cass. What? No, no calm down. What's the matter? Did you try calling him? And you're sure it's the right number? Okay, do you have cash and a credit card, right? Yeah, where are you? - i'm in that place that looks like Piccadilly. - Times Square? You know what, fuck him, okay? You know what? Go shopping, have fun and just book a flight home, okay? Bye. I don't know what you do on those early Saturday morning shifts, but when I'm here, bags, make-up and especially phones stay downstairs. If I see any of said items or anything else I deem inappropriate, you will be fired. Is that clear? - Yes. - Great. Tee? It's 4:00 am. You said we could rotate, and me and Angelo have been up at the registers forever. Shut up! He is such an asshole. Is he always like this? Since he's been here, yep. Strangely sexy, though. Oh, shit. Where's the safe key? Don't know, it was here earlier. Well, look, I can handle the register. Take a break. - What you saying, blud? - Hi, man. Oh, great, this is just what I need right now. Hi, Terry. I heard you been sleeping with Doug? Is it true? We've only been split up one month. One. No, I have not, actually. What is it? What, it's bigger than mine, is it? Is he better in bed than me, is he? Yeah, yeah. You know what, you caught me, yeah. But mine's bigger though, right? Hey. This isn't a confessionaI or a hospitaI. There's no visiting hours here, so buy something or fuck off. Hey, Kerrys. I'm so fucking tired. I'm sorry, babe. You'll definitely pass next time. See you tomorrow. ...continues to surround this robbery. How could this not be an inside job? is it a conflict diamond cover up? Are there illegal stones... - You guys eating lunch without me? - You were sleeping. And how do you sell tens of millions of pounds worth of diamonds, when there's such heavy media coverage surrounding the robbery? Do us a favour, put the kettle on. - Oh, yeah, I'd love a coffee. - I'll have a... I'll make you one, too. What time did you get in, hon? Finished at 6:00, got in about 20 past? Do you know that guy that I went out with last night? Well, he wants to take me out again. - Yeah, so? - So, will you work again tonight? Gwen, come on. Jo, please. Just tonight. I really like him. I really like him. Slut. I need you to go and get them now. Good. Yeah, it's got to be today. She's flying in tonight and she's leaving tomorrow. All the boys with you? Well, go and do it now. All right, man, cooI. Later. What? Hey, Shannon, what's up? - What? Did you see a note yesterday? No, I don't. What letter? I don't know anything about a letter. Look, just come by and see me later. I got to get off the phone. I can't be on the phone here. Yes. Yes, I'm getting off the phone. I'm getting off the phone. You don't have to say it. Rim. Good choice. Come on. - All right? You know, they're all lazy. So, the thing is, they walk in, they lean, they see, they lean, they see, and it's just here. Yeah. I'm just a bit worried about the access there. Condoms, plunger, hamster food. - Aisle three. Thanks. - You working all night again? - It should be illegaI. I like you. I mean, I liked working with you last night. Yeah, I liked working with you, too. It was probably the only part of the night that I enjoyed. What about sexy Tee? Are you jealous? Look, firstly, yeah, you know, he's kind of hot, brooding, arrogant, - and he probably has a really big... - I'm still here. I'm sorry, yeah. No, look, he's a dick. I don't need that. You're sweet, that's important. Angelo, why do I see empty shelves in my store? Didn't I tell you yesterday to fill them? I'm sure I did. Oh, no, not right now. Hey, yo, whoa, whoa. Who's on the register? I'll be right back. I'll just be two minutes. You know, I gotta... Yeah, I know you never leave a register unattended. And I can't let you go anywhere with those untiI you pay for them. Okay, but how am I supposed to pay for something when you don't let me bring my bag up here? Okay, well you go down. You get your money. You come back, pay for them. You go back down and then you do whatever it is you need to do. Hey, yo, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't go anywhere untiI someone's back on register. Are you being serious? Okay, you know what? Fine, fine, I'll just bleed on the floor. Hey, look I don't care what you do. Just know that I'm watching you. You're watching me? How about that I'm watching you? I mean, what was the deaI yesterday with the safe key? Huh? If you say one fucking word about that key... All done. I'm going back on till. Where is this guy? No, no, no, calm down, bruv. How many times have I got to tell you? You get the money, then you do the job. It's common sense. There's supposed to be thousands. - No. - Fuck this. Shit. Man, you trying to take me for some dickhead out here? Now, get him. Keep your mouth shut, all right? And you won't get hurt. - Get over here. Move. - You! Open up the till, blud. Hurry up. I'm getting paid today. Try to take me for some dickhead. Hurry up, blud. Hurry up. All right, if you shut up, you won't get hurt. Hurry up, man. We're closed. Sorry. Oh, I... Well, I thought this was a 24-hour... Oh. - I'll call the police. - The police are down the road, blud. - Well, hurry up, then. - No more games, Tee. Take your shit. You fucking idiot. You said you'd act like you didn't know me. You're supposed to come in, drop the stuff off, get your money and leave. You don't rob the store, and you don't implicate me. Yeah, well, I would've done that, if the money that you said would've been there was. But it weren't. So... Fuck! You tried to warn that guy, didn't you? And now you're gonna shut your mouth or I'm gonna hurt you. - Don't hurt her. - Shut your mouth, all right? You're all gonna keep your mouths shut. And you? Don't think about getting brave out here. Good luck. Do you have any idea what's going to happen to me if these don't get where they're supposed to go? It's my friend. I'll get rid of her. - Hey, Jo. Hey, look, I'm busy. - You need to go. Why are you being like that? Look, you need to leave. Leave. I just came to talk to you. Why are you being like that? Can you just go? Why? 'Cause she's here with her man. And she don't want you here. Fuck you. No! Did she take them? I couldn't tell. - I don't know. I don't know. - You said that this would be simple. If she took them, you're a dead man. Where are you going? - Get your wallet out. Hurry up. - All right, I'm... See, now I know who you are, all right? So, if you try anything, you're fucking dead. Tee, think fast. Now, it's got your prints on it, all right? Just in case you thought about getting a bit clever. Let's go, man. Okay, okay, you didn't see anything and you didn't hear anything. If anyone even looks at me wrong for the next month, I'm gonna come and find you. Get the fuck out! Get out! Get out, get out. - You, get over here. - No, I won't say anything. - Please, Tee. - Shut up, shut up. Stop it. Leave him alone. What's wrong with you? Hey. Stop it. No. So, where were you actually stood during all of this kafuffle? I was behind the counter. And so you pretty much saw everything, I guess? I mean, yeah, they were kind of hidden around. I... ...about to tackle him, like I should, being the guard and stuff. Well, this guy came from over here and he just hit me, you know? I had this cake in my hand, and it went all over my face. So, is it usuaI practise for the CCTV not to be in use? I must have forgot to put the new one in. - The person who hit you... - Yeah. ...were they big or small? Medium. Right. Couldn't understand them, they... You think they were foreign? Sorry. How many were there, would you say? But, I was very... Very dazed at that point. - Four? - Four. - Four, okay. - Five. Four or five. - Four or five. - Seven. Seven. No, I don't know how many there were. Look, I admit that it is a bit strange having a safe on the shop floor, but we assumed that it was the last place people would look. Frankly, it's lucky that I took that cash out, you know, for the wife. You are about to die. Hiya. You all right? kO. Yeah, I'm fine. You been up long? - Like, 20 minutes? - Okay, well listen. They're still gonna open tonight, so if you don't wanna go back there or anything, I'll cover your shift. - Wait, they're opening? - Yep. The police have finished there. Barry said something about his manager guy or something wanted to go in, and he was wondering if you or I would. Look, Gwen, I think... No, I know that the manager, Tee, he's involved. He organised the whole thing. Bullshit. Have you got proof? Fucking hell. Jo, have you shown the police? I couldn't. He was right there watching all of us. Look, I think I'm just gonna go in and that way he won't be suspicious. And besides, you know, nothing's going to happen at the same store two days in a row. It's fine. No, I'll go. Okay, see you later. Oh, my God. Jo, you must have been so scared. Yeah, I guess I was. You have one new message. Jo, i dunno what the fuck is going on, but i think i've got some stolen... - Diamonds? - What? Nothing. Nothing. This looks so much better on me than when you wear it. Hi. Is Gwen there, please? - Thanks. Gwen? - Who is it? It's Dave, for you. He wants to take you out again. Oh, my God, he cannot see me in this uniform. Okay, I'll make him welcome. Jo, he wants to take me out again. - Oh, my God, he's so nice. Dave, hi. It's so nice to... Okay, look, I know you're supposed to be going to Kerrys' brother's party or whatever, and I know that I said I'd cover for you, but, please, if you could just do it this - one last time, even... - Fine. - What? - I'll do it. Okay, okay. So, hon, this is Dave. - You're welcome. Dude. Hi. Hi, Jo. - Kerrys, are you with Shannon? - I fucked up big time. - what did you do? You don't wanna know. ...when she reads the note her mum wrote her. - What note? - we should probably find her. Okay, well, look, if anything happens to me, it's some guy named Tee. - Okay? - who's Tee? Gotta go. - Dave. - No, thank you. Take it. What is he doing? How you doing? I've been getting really worried about you. I'm fine. Are you guys all right? Yeah, my nose is a bit bruised. Well, where's Barry? Not here. Tee opened up. Told us to act normaI. I popped all the tops when he wasn't looking. Yeah, he's been searching them ever since. Getting more and more upset. He hasn't found what he's looking for. Arsehole. - I think my friend has them. - What? What he's looking for, the diamonds. What did I tell you yesterday? - Look, guys, no, no, listen. No, no, no, guys. We can sort this out. Guys, guys. Okay, seriously. Back the fuck up. This is none of your business, girly. Angelo, take their guns. Angelo! Look, we just wanna take this guy and get out of your hair. I can't let you do that. Yeah, he's an asshole and this is really none of my business, and usually, I'd let you just take him and not even bat an eyelid. You know why? Because ever since my reaI dad died, that's what Jo does. "Hey, Jo, can you make me some coffee, tea?" "Sure". "Hey, Jo, can you do this charity swim?" "Yeah, of course. " "Oh, Jo, can you work for me?" "Sure. " "Jo, give me your last cigarette. " "Here you go. " "Jo, can I put it there tonight?" "Sure, knock yourself out. " Jo, Jo, Jo. Yes, yes, yes. Well, today, for the first time, I'm gonna say no. I'm not gonna let you leave. I'm not gonna let you take him, and although he really deserves it, I'm not gonna let him die for some shiny rocks that, quite frankly, bitch, I don't think you deserve. 'Cause you know what I'd like? - What? - A fucking thank you. For everything I do. From just one person. "Great job at work, you know, how about a raise?" But no. No, I get you. Well, thank you. Now, either shoot us or get out of my way. - Ideas? - Shoot her! - Just shoot her! - Shut up! You have 10 seconds to drop your gun and let me leave. Five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One. Ow! Fuck. Ow! Kerrys, what the fuck? - Come here. Are you okay? Yeah. Here. Take my keys and go get in my car, okay? ...car has crashed. I repeat car has crashed... Where are you going? We need backup, now! We're going in. - "Ask for Tee"? - He's here. - Hello, Tee. - Fuck. Oh, my God. This is so cooI. Hey, come on, seriously. Put that down. - Cass, you're here. i know where Shaz is. - Where? - ... her place doesn't mean her home? - Where is it, then? We'll come pick you up. - Yeah. Blake Street. Bye. Cass knows where Shannon is. Her place isn't her house, stupid. And you know those diamonds that were stolen the other day? Shannon has them. Shaz! Come down with the stones. - Right now. - I told you to get rid of that. I've always wanted to say something like that. We've got what you want. Now, give us what we want. You safe with us. - No! - Shannon. Shaz. Shannon. - Shannon. - Grab my hand. - Shannon. Grab my hand. Grab my hand. Just do it. Hey, you're doing it. Go up here. Up here. Shannon. - Hang on, I've got it, I've got it. - That's it. - Come on. - Come on. - Come on... - Oh, God. You can do it. You can do it. Come on. Come on. Oh, God. Shan, why do you want to kill yourself? I don't. I mean, I did, but I changed my mind before you got here. I just slipped. You know, that whole thing with Dillon, it wasn't what it looked like at all. I know. We all read your note. - We're sorry. - We're so sorry. I don't want to read it. I know what it says. We didn't know about the baby. I was going to tell you, I just... I've just been feeling... Alone? - But you're not. - We're so sorry. We would have been here sooner. - Just been... - Occupied. But whatever happened, we're here for you now. In our own shit way. Yeah. - How did you know about these? - It's a long story. Big reward. I've got one, too. What are we going to do with them? Turn them in? That way we can get back to normaI life, please. After the weekend I've had, normaI sounds like heaven. Maybe we shouldn't get back to normaI lives just yet. What, you got a better idea? Gwen, you know that favour you owe me? Well, I want it now. - What did your dad have to say? - I didn't see him, but I figure I've got a few days. What did you want my spray can for? Nothing. And what am I supposed to tell the old ones? You'll think of something. I'm ready. Cass, what about your parents? I'm sure they'll recover once I tell them that Mr Larofsky agreed to teach me. - Well done, babe. - Thanks. You guys are sure you wanna do this? - Hell, yeah. - Yeah. Fuck, yeah. well, we're just hearing that this is coming out of a mini-mart in west London, and we have Susan Sanders on location. wouldn't you say this is an incredible development in the story? That's right. An unassuming mini-mart in west London has played stage to the first in a domino rally of criminals who have all reportedly turned informant on their higher level boss. I'm gonna be in so much trouble. I think we all are. But that's what rich parents and their cash are for, right? God bless them. Can we get some drinks over here? Coming right up, madam. Do you think we'll have fun in America? Of course we're gonna have fun in America. I'm gonna show you guys around. Five days, four girls, what the fuck could possibly go wrong? Can I get you a drink? - Vodka on the rocks, thanks. Coming right up. You know we're going to a strip club when we get to New York? Hey, what are you guys talking about? Hey, Cass...
