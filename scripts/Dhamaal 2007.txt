Subhash Chandra Bose said, `You give me blood.. ..and l will give you freedom`. Jai Hind! l will tell you! l will tell you! Have you gone mad? - Quiet! l value my life. Sir, l will tell you. Before dying Bose said that he has hidden 100 million.. ..in Chiplun, 40 feet away from the main square.. ..4 feet under the chickoo tree. Chiplun! Chiplun! You cheaters, deceivers! You bloody baskets! You lied to me, you told me that man said before dying.. ..that he has hidden 100 million in St. Sebastian.. ..garden under some W in Goa! You are not worthy of being called friends. Cheater cocks! Enough Manav. - What enough! Thank you very much. - You are welcome. Excuse me, look l have proposal. Look, we can distribute that money amongst ourselves. lf you will give the entire money to the government.. ..what will you get? - Correct. What did l get after doing my doing honestly for 10 years.. ..transfer to Yavatmal. That`s why those 100 million will go in my pocket.. ..and not in the government treasury. - What? One more thing? You play the game of death everyday, don`t you? Let`s have a game with me too. lnspector sir! Hey, where are you going? - Hey, don`t move. Manav, why are you laughing? That inspector is so stupid. He tied our necks, he tied our hands.. ..but he didn`t tie our legs, come on lets go to Goa. Have you gone mad, stand straight.. ..or the four of us will die. - All four. Of course all four of us, the noose around your neck.. ..that is been crossed around the tree and in Boman`s neck.

Adi, keep quiet, don`t talk and especially to this Manav.. ..all this has happened because of him. What did l do? You told that inspector everything.. ..and he hung us here and left. What did you do when you had the gun in your hand? l will play the game of death, the game of death. Now we are all stuck. l was just.. lf you will keep arguing like this, then l am leaving.

Hey, save us.. That scoundrel inspector must have gone quite far by now. No, he wont have gone very far. How do you know? Because when l had fallen unconscious, then.. According to my calculation.. ..that inspector might not have gone far. lt will take atleast 15-20 minutes to change the pipe.. ..until then have some tea at the inn. Hurry up. - Right now sir. You are not a hero but a villain.. l had told you, that inspector must not have gone far. l have a very good idea.. ..let us flee with the inspectors car. lf we have the car then what is the need to flee. - Correct. lf this time the inspector catches us.. ..then he will hang us in a different way. And before he can hang us again.. ..we should take care of him. Yes. - Senior inspector Adi. lnspector Roy. - Yes. Where is Pasha? - Pasha? Yes, the man that came in that car. ln this jeep. Yes, he is a very dangerous criminal.. ..and he poses as a inspector. He first tried to kill us, and then fled with out the jeep. What are you saying? Tried to kill us, and then fled with out jeep. - What? Tried to kill us, and then fled with out jeep. - What? l have already said it twice, are you deaf? There is also a reward on him. How much? - 15 hundred thousand! What are you saying? l am right. And whoever helps us in catching him.. ..he will get a reward of 15 hundred thousand from the government. l will get 15 hundred thousand! l will catch him! l will catch him! So you survived. We survived Pasha, but you cannot escape the law Pasha. Pasha, who is Pasha? - You are Pasha. l am Pasha? He said, l am Pasha. - Pasha. Your game is over Pasha. What Pasha, l am inspector Kabir.
