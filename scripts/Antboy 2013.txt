Want to see your daughter again, should use the time well. Otherwise I suck her blood instead of yours. Do you not know who he is? Her father is like Lex Luthor... - He is not. - She does not know who it is. It is the villain of Superman. Yes. A rich guy everyone thinks well of, but who will take over the world! - So funny you are. - You can be yourself! - Does your dad enemies? - Some do not like him. - It's cold on top of ExoFarm. - Factory outside the city. - What kind of medicine they make? - Vaccines. But the research also. - On what? - It's a secret. Father says they are trying to help the seriously ill. - What if it's one from the city. - Marianne... She is evil. - Or Mark and Allan? - They're too stupid. Is that Amanda's necklace? - What do you do? - I can smell her. Right. - Over there. - It's Mrs. Gmelkrs house. This is where I was bitten. In Gmelkrs garden. - Here I got my powers. - The house has been empty since she died. She rotted for two weeks before they found her. I have heard that it lasted for two months. Liquids from the dead body seeped into the house. The body was dry as a mummy. One can certainly hear her shuffling there all night. Is it true? I have to go inside. Antboy is the no wimp. Hello? As you scared me! - Are you in? - Yes, in the basement. - It resembles a laboratory. - Have you found Amanda Not yet. - I get chills of this place. - Be careful. Flea can be there. I hear you barely. I'll get you out. So we meet at last, Antboy... Release Amanda free. She has not done you any! No. But it's her dad, Director ExoFarm. Director Summer Place. He has ruined my life. I was a biochemist at ExoFarm. My research was groundbreaking. What kind of research? A rare maurart. Formica accelonia. I thought that the species had antibodies that could cure life-threatening diseases. Therefore I developed serum Hercules to transfer healing properties to my first test subject. My Mom. - Are you Mrs. Gmelkrs son? - Yes. Her tumors became smaller and smaller. But then Summer Place to save money in the company. My research was the first smoke. I was furious and tried to threaten the rule of to let me continue. Summer Place did not care. "Did I hear a flea cough?" said he. And Mom... It was too late. After her death began revenge my plans to take shape. I chose a different species. Pulex irritans. Blodloppen. Flea properties removed gout and made me stronger. Be glad you only need sugar to your powers. When I got flea strength, I also got blood lust. You were bitten by the last of its kind. A genetically modified Hercules ants. You should thank me, Antboy. Or should I say Pelle? Amanda just loves Antboy. She does not even know that Pelle Nhrmann exist. And your friend, comic book nerd. Is that your friendship he want? I see you for what you really are, Pelle. A little piss ant to be crushed under my foot. See you soon again. Flea was right. Why would I risk life for people who cared about me I was just a little ants who wanted he was big, strong and loved. But now the dream was over, and the ant was awake again. I just wanted to be Pelle Nrhmann and forget that Antboy had found. I could not save her. I could not save Amanda. What? Flea fled, and Amanda are safe. It was not my merit. I did not have a chance. We can not give up as long Flea go free. If you fight against Flea, can be Antboy! - Okay! - Okay. And literature... As Anna said, it can be educational materials. If there are several proposals for what literature is? Are books about tools nonfiction or fiction? Books about how to do things... Follow me! - Pelle! Flea attacks the school. - The police will take care of. BUG SPRAY Do not worry. Run out to the others. Antboy! Antboy saved me! Wilhelm... Let go of me, you louse! Insects have been available in 500 million years and will survive mankind. Also, I have no lice, but a flea! Do you know what is the problem with super villains? You talk too much. Antboy...? You are the dumbest genius I have ever met. The game is over, Gmelkr. Let my friend otherwise you get a real flea medication! What's the matter? Do you Sukkersug? Sugar! - Let him go! - Your friend is out in the woods. It's supposed to be so nice in nature. Wilhelm! - Flea has taken Wilhelm. - I know! I've got candy. Wilhelm! What is it? Antboy... I thought that there was need for sugar that was your Achilles heel, Antboy. But there are people who is your weakness? - Where are you? - Do not know. I have an idea. Antboy... Gmelkr! Pee Maur... Imagine that you risk so much... ...For such a pathetic little weakling! Weaklings is my friend. What is it to have friends when you have unlimited power? You are not as strong as you think. Your pests. Time for dessert... Do you know what your weakness is? Blood tank is empty, and you have no friends to help you. You've lost Gmelkr. Give up. Never! Did you know that ants can lift 50 times its own weight? Thanks, Pelle. Arrest puts an end for Gmelkr, - who kidnapped Amanda Summer Place and attack the school. ExoFarm we investigate flea crimes so something like never happens again. I am very happy and relieved- - that my daughters and all its children can sleep safely - now that Albert Gmelkr is arrested. Thank dishes I also to our dear Antboy. A little boy with a big heart. This window should be closed. For safety's sake. I hoped that you would come and I should thank you. - Is Ida home? - Ida? I just came to give you this. - Ida?! - Your sister. - What is it? - You visit... Hello. What are you doing here? - I just wanted to thank you for your help. - It is I who should thank you. You're cool, Pelle Nrhmann. Did not you think I know that? Wonder no more have known. No worries, I will not tell. I have to go. Wait, Pelle! Can not we be friends? See you tomorrow, Ida. I had to give Skipper flea medication. I wanted to talk to you about something. I have an idea for a new look. - I'm happy with the one I have. - It's not for you. - You need a right hand. - Ida will probably not be superhero. - Who's talking about Ida? - I was just kidding, Wilhelm. - Needed Antboy when fleas are gone? - Such as Antboy takes forever. Have you ever wanted that you were someone else? In any case I. But not anymore. Antboy have super powers and many admirers. Pelle is still a small ant in a large mound. And that's okay. Is there one thing an ant has, there friends. I have too. Fortunately, because you can not save the world alone. Right?
