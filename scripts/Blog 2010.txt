Okay, let's go and get them to have a look at you, okay? Don't worry, okay? Come on. Let's go. It appears that these thirteen students deliberately set out on a course of action which they began during an end of schooI yeartrip to Majorca. And given the end result and according to the experts, they must have continued with afterthe end of the school year to achieve their objectives. The Department of Education and its workers are responsible forthe development and training of the students enrolled in their centres. However, individual, secret and personal decisions taken by the students without consulting theirtutors orteachers are, legally, the responsibility of the individual student. This department wishes to make clear that there has been no negligence, forgetfulness or fault in the education or supervision of this group. My name is Marta Anglada, I'm 15 years old and I'm in the 3rd year of senior school at Herrera Institute. I love reading, drawing and writing. I'm really into History. I really like animals. I've got a kitten called Gala who is black, and she's really cute, but she doesn't like being stroked and she's very unfriendly. My favourite colour is green. I think it's a luminous colour, a happy colour, a colour that goes with everything and it always looks good. It's the colour of nature of freedom, of hope. If I had to define myself as a colour, I would define myself as green. Go on, closer. You can even see the pores in my skin. I doubt many people are going to see this, anyway. Let's see... God! It's only going to be seen by us. Let's see? But go a bit lower. Lower, lower. Don't come so close. Film hertits! I don't know how you're going to see my tits in this. Me even less! Well, it's going to have to be like this. One, two, three, Herrera! I like old values: Classical Greece, Ancient Egypt as well. The lluminati. Really it all... it all gives the feeling of liberty. Everything was different then. I'd love to start a secret society. My life is boring and monotonous and everything is always the same. I talked about it with Aurea and I think that she thinks the same. Doing it with more people gives it more importance, makes it more interesting, makes it bigger. I'm not going to tell my parents, they'd never understand it, because they never understand anything. They don't know what it is, they can't remember what it is like to be 15 and to dream and to see another... to have another view of the world. They really wouldn't understand. Gosh, this is a drag. Let's see, faith... Faith is a feeling... Is it a feeling? No. Okay, no. Faith is... call me when u cn! Come on, Paula. Fuck, don't get distracted. Come on... I love it! coz it doesn't mean anything But it will mean everything! What do we do now? I'm waiting 4 Paula to call me to ask her to join We rock! 3 I, Paula, swear with my hand on my heart that I will never let my sisters down in any way. I swearto be loyal to Makamat and to never betray us. I also swear to defend my sisters in all situations and from anybody and so make and collaborate so we are one heart, one mind and one thought. Girls. Awesome! Anyone there? Girls it was amazing The world is ours We can do anything! I'll be quick coz my mom is lurking around I'm thinking that We have 2 share this I think we have to tell... The more of us we R the bigger it'll b! Yeah! I'm here I'm so excited I don't think I can sleep... I think it's awesome I'm thrilled 2 We need to think about people we can trust who feel like us What about Sandra? I bet she joins 4 sure Hiii:D Sorry, was having dinner Yes to everything I 3 MAKAMA Perfect! Paula, call Sandra! Aurea, bring the camera! I 3 MAKAMAT 2 :) gnite I love that in Facebook there's loads of comments like: I love your hair, I love your hair... Your hair's really weird. I love your hair! But my hair means something, you know? When I got my hair cut, it was all the same, both sides were the same. And the crest. But then, to make it more my own, I said... Like I've got two sides, so I thought: My outer side is like: "Watch out, I'm sharp, don't mess with me. " And the other is: "I'm naked", you know? I'm a softie and very sensitive. And... I take a lot of care with my hair, 'cause I love my hair. They're getting out of class. They must be coming. We were meeting here, right? She's taking ages. Aurea, man, you're a pain with the camera. Hey, Marta, wash your hands already. What for? Come on, Sandra, man. You've done it loads of times, you've taken the leap. Well, go on now. Okay, it's just people think about things and so on... But you're not like everyone else. From the moment you told us that maybe or yes, you're different from all the rest. You don't want to go back to being... Whatever. Stop, stop! Come on, Sandra. Aurea, what do you say? I've already given my opinion. You've got to go ahead with it. We've all got to do this together. Of course. But we are all together in class. This is different. Together in something very special! Sandra, something very special. I'm not sure... This is something that's only going to happen once in your life. But if I'm not sure, what do you want, man! - If you've got a problem... - Marta! We can help you. Seriously. - Of course. - We are here to help you. You know you're really important to me, but this is... Well, you're not showing it. We need you, girl. Come on, sign. When I got out of class, I went with some of my friends to look at clothes and stuff and... WelI, I felt really bad because they could go into shops with normal sizes, which are from 34 to 42, I guess, I don't know, and I had to go into a large sizes shop because I couldn't fit into the clothes my friends were trying on at all. And... I don't know. It fucks me up that I can't love myself. I can't love me, which is what you're meant to do, and I can't do it because... I don't know... Because I'm not like I want to be. My eyes are really ugly. They've got nothing, brown like everyone's. They're horrible, from the bad pile. I'd love to have green ones. Or blue, but more green. My eyelashes, yes, they're fine. My nose is like a witch's. My nose goes down like a witch's, horrible. This part of my face is horrible. Please... I'm sorry. I'm bored. And I'm very stressed. I've got to study physics and chemistry and I'm just not getting it. I've got an exam tomorrow and I'm going to fail with the biggest zero. And I can't make notes 'cause they won't do me any good. Even ifI know the formula I won't know how to use it. Because I don't know how to do it, I don't know... Nothing, nothing, nothing... I'm going to flunk. What can I do? Stupid physics and chemistry. I've bought a new eyeliner because my old one was worn out and too old and I've drawn a line. It suits me, doesn't it? It's cool. It's great because you just go "zip" and it's stays on. This summer in the town I go to every year, I met a boy. I went out with my girlfriends and they introduced me to him. I was talking to him all night and he seemed really nice and very good-looking. He had a real cool motorcycle and he said he could take me home on it, but I said no. But then he said that he would come and pick me up, that he'd come and pick me up the next day and that we'd be together again and so. Anyway, he came and found me. The next night he came to find me and we spent the whole night together on the beach. I really fell in love with him. Really. He was older and I guess he knew what to say so that I would fall at his feet. He had just split up with his ex-girlfriend and that girl, when she found out that he was with someone else, well, she wasn't happy and she decided to get back with him. One night I went out with my friends and I saw them together. Yes, yes, they are together. Everybody told me. And thank God, 'cause he'd been having a hard time. How easy it was for him that I just disappeared. Today I saw him in the subway and I hadn't seen him since the summer. I don't know what he's doing in Barcelona. He didn't see me. I hope. I need to sleep. What did she say? That we'll talk later, for me to tell her everything later. - Tell her what? - We'll talk later. Quieten down everybody! Silence! Silence! You four, please, join the group. Come on, Javi. Hurry up a bit. Let me introduce you to Miguel. He's the guide at the museum. If you have any questions, after... He's going to show us a bit of what's here. Quiet... Now I'm going to hand this out. This is some information which will help you with the homework that has to be handed in next week. Come on, you know what I'm talking about. Don't ask stupid questions and listen to Miguel in silence. Good afternoon, welcome to you all... Please be quiet! This is the museum of ethnology and we are inviting you to take a trip through time which will take us from traditional cultures to interculturality. What a loonie of a guide we've got. What a drag, man. This is a double drag. Have you seen a hunk like that. He is talking as though it were interesting. He thinks it is. Listen, this is shit! Where have that lot brought us? At least we're missing class, man. Bea! Look, look. Where have these people dragged us? The myth! What's that? Girls. - Aurea, look. - Come over here, please. Long live the bull! - The what? - The little bull! Sandra, please. From 1955. Give me one for Aurea since she's got the camera. - If you want I'Il take it. - No, thanks, Sandra. - But record the visit. - Yeah, yeah, calm down. Come on, please. Follow the tour, please. You've got to record the visit, Aurea. You're getting distracted. Okay. These objects have been acquired in ethnographical camps or are from donations made by travellers, private collectors or scholars. If you come this way... Don't get distracted by people! You're here to record the visit. Come on! Move along! Have you never asked yourself? Yes, really? If cosmic phenomena are the result of divine intervention or if there is life after death or if we can communicate with the dead or our ancestors. Also the moral aspect of the human being when he wonders, when he reflects on his own existence, on his moral principals or his relationship with the rest... That... Don't touch, please. They put the collar on the cows, for example. They identified the herd owner and also stopped them from escaping. Marta. Maria could do it too, don't you think? Yes, fine. ...so well portrayed in Manga comics, to end in the Ethiopian pavillion. Maria, can we talk to you for a minute? Yeah. It's just... I was watching on the computer the last two episodes of"El internado" and I started crying. It's just there was blood pouring out of Ivan's nose and that means he's got the virus. He's going to die. And that was the last episode of the season and who knows when the next season will be on. I LUV U ALL I 3 MAKAMA the max! Yesterday my mother asked me if I'd been with a boy and all that. And I said: "Yes, Mum, of course!" Are we crazy? Of course! But... It's not something I'm really into, know what I mean? I don't know. I'm not going to get upset over this. I sometimes wonder... I wonder if I have any personality. Because... For example, with clothes, I prefer wearing something... I feel more comfortable if my friend likes the t-shirt or if she says that she likes it, or my mother or a friend of mine, ratherthan me on my own. I choose something if I see that other people like it, and if they don't like it, I won't get it. I feel insecure wearing something that other people don't like. So if I like it, I go and say: "I like this t-shirt". But I don't get it because one of my friends or my mother doesn't like it. That is a lack of personality and basically it doesn't frighten me but... It pisses me off. It's like I'm not independent, you know? I always need someone to approve of what I'm doing. If not, I don't feel good, I've got no confidence, I'm not comfortable. That's what being bored and thinking does. I did really badly. There were questions I didn't know in the exam. But what is she writing? I don't know, she keeps writing. - She's going to get a 9 or a 10. - To make a change. Now she's getting stressed. She's finished already, finally. You'll see now. So, how did you do? Come on, Laura! Run, Laura! Go on, Laura! I know you're doing something. I want to join. I'm sick of always being left out! Come on! Yes? Hello. What? Yes. What? Yes... I don't know, Dad. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know, Dad. Well, I've... Bye. Bye. Yes. Okay, bye. Okay, bye. No, Dad! We'll talk later, okay? I'll call you later. Yes! Bye. Gosh, what a drag! Sandra, very good. Very good. Sit down. Yago, when you want. Julia. What are you doing? It's just I want to film it. You are totally obsessed. Have you talked to him yet? No. And what are you waiting for? Okay. Majorca is the biggest island of the Balearic archipelago. Like the other islands... Talk to him. I don't know... Just do something. Julia, please. Girls, it's... In this town there have been various sightings of UFOs. ARE THERE UFOS IN MAJORCA? So cute, he's nuts... You're so in love, dude. And... I don't know, we could visit there. We could get in contact with them. They have a blog and everything... Not the UFOs. He's superfreak. Did you see those eyes? - Have you finished? - Yes. Well, then sit down. Look, Tomas is playing soccer! - How weird! - And Alberto's the goalie. Is that boy sweating? Because... They're all sweaty, how revolting! Bea got off with the skater. No, I didn't. I did a little job on him but that was ages... Awhat? Bea, a what? A little job? - And exactly what does that mean? - Having a good time, you know... - Is it finished? - Shit. - What do you want? - Play it again! - Look. - Ah, replay. - Pass me a slice of pizza, please. - Which one do you want? Whatever, it doesn't matter. - This one? - Yeah, that one. Hey, your mother... She's really made an effort. - With the food. - Let's not shout too much, okay? Poorthing. Later, when she's asleep, she doesn't notice a thing. Why's that? - She puts earplugs in? - No. - She takes sleeping pills. - Oh, really? Like my grandmother. Come on, Sandra! It's the truth. Yago! Yago! Oh, Yago! Look at her face. She's so into him. Yeah, and him into her. But what's going on between you and him? I can see you in class. - Should I turn round, should I... - And those looks. - But I don't know ifhe likes me. - How could he not like you? Maybe he doesn't like tall girls. Shit... Yago is taller than you. Well... A bit. Fine, but he's taller. But everyone is shorterthan me. Yeah but in that case, what? Poorthing. - So what? Being short, isn't... - That's true. Hey, I've got taller now, okay? We always complain about what we haven't got - and we want what we don't have. - Yeah. I want to have hair like yours and look at my hair, like a ball. You guys don't get it, you feeI comfortable like you are. - No! - I'm short and it's horrible. But you can wear high heels. What about me? Should I get my ankles operated? Should I have my femur removed? What about me? Should I have the operation... Come on, shut up, you are all perfect. Of course, you're the one who got off with... No way! Fuck! I'm totally fed up! I didn't fuck so many guys. Did I? How many? Three? WelI, I had a good time! It's very healthy. Where do we come from? Sandra, if you had to, who would you get off with from our class? I don't know. - I just don't think... - It's really healthy! With those creeps it's not healthy. Where do you think we come from? Look, Oscar. Who do I like? - I was talking about Oscar. - Phew, I got a fright. But I don't like him really. It was just a silly fling. A silly fling. You're being a real pain! Look! This is us! I'm stuck in the middle! Look! We can see... Poor Maria, you're squashing her! No pinching! She's mine! - Nobody loves me, Aurea. - I love you. Who doesn't love you? Who doesn't love you? I love you! - Marta. - What? - Are you sleeping? - No, and you? No. I'm not tired. Look at how cute they are. They said they were going to last. Yeah. The poor things have fallen asleep. You wanna share a cigarette? Okay. I've written something. Can I read it to you? Sure, Marta. Another year runs through our fingers, another part of time, which at our age is an eternity. Look, at this time, together, we've laughed, talked, shared personal things and very personal things; we've jumped, danced, sung, been crazy, we've gone out, we've played and we've even, in the worst cases, cried. Think how many experiences we are going to have from now on. Tonight, I looked up at the sky and the clouds and I thought about how many skies, clouds, storms and rain bursts we could share. How many days we are going to be togetherthis year; looking up at the sky and counting the stars which fit in one hand. Trying to guess what the shapes of the clouds are and looking at the sea from one of the terraces in the city, and feeling that this is the most complete year that we've lived so far. It's all going to work out okay, isn't it? Of course. U there? Yes I am What U doing? Nothing... U? nothing... a bit bored... x( I don't feel well... why? I can't go on with Makamat... I don't feel comfortable, it's not the same for me as for you guys what?:- / I don't know, Paula, boys... I can't see myself with one... ...you can't see yourself with a boy? no... I've been thinking about it a lot and I don't see myself in makamat don't worry... have you talked to the girls? no don't know what to say it's no easy 4 me... I'm in a mess Don't know what 2 do, really:( I'll talk to Marta if u want:) ok:) thanks You're the best! 3 np, when I've talked to her I'Il call u Gnite CU tomorrow Well, I've found out... that I've failed two subjects, and they still haven't told me my grades and I'm sure that... I've failed two more. I'm going to fail 4 in total. That's heavy, man. I don't know what I'm going to do. It's a pain because it's going to mess everything up. Aurea, you record with the red button, don't you? You are recording. Okay, okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm sure. If something goes wrong get out of there immediately. - If something goes bad I take off. - Of course... And we'll be together in 5 minutes, don't worry. They might expel you. He's the head of studies, man! - They'll expel all of us. - They're not going to expel anybody. This is not going to work out. Paula, it's going to work. Aurea isn't going to come on the trip, anyway. Aurea is definitely coming on the trip, okay? We have to think that... Sandra has already let us down and we can't let anybody else let us down. I haven't let you down... Sandra is going to be here, so Sandra is with us. - She's never going to leave us. - Yeah, I know... - And she's got her reasons. - Sure, she has. No problem. - It's just... - She's going to be him. I get there and... - Shit it's hardly a plan... - Well, man, it's disgusting. - Don't come too close... - Your space. I don't know... But you've got to be sexy. Haven't you heard? He doesn't shower! Well, I'll work it out. I guess when I'm there... Man, I'm not going to be there, there's going to be some 40 something old guy who doesn't shower, stinks... - How disgusting! - Okay... Where are you going to put the camera? - In my bag. - No, I'll take it. Give it to me. Yeah, that's a good idea. Come in. Today I'm going to hold your hand... Wikipedia... In general, it is recognized that the sexual act contributes to relaxation. The basic position is the missionary, in which the copulated member is Iying on their back with their legs open. The person who is penetrating places themselves on top, facing the other one. Missionary... - Is she sucking his trousers? - Yes. You should see the look on your faces, it's... Hey, Aurea, shut up already. Stop recording so much and watch the film. Come on, please... It's like that! Shut up, girl! She's got stretchmarks! - Where? - Have you seen them? Now it's time... - But what's that? - What a huge cock! It looks fake! Oh my god! That's over the top! And in the poster it looks tiny. But... what the heck is that? Deep throat. Girl, yuck! But why is he spitting on her! No, up the arse must really hurt. Only the guy likes it, right? It's like a lump of shit coming out of your arse, isn't it? Constipation... I don't know... Of course, because ifit gets opened up wide, then... Can you imagine if something came out? It's disgusting! Nobody is going to do it up the arse! - But it must do damage, there. - And you don't get knocked up. - Hey, Laura! - And you explode! Your arse cracks. - God! - She's got a vibrator in her hand. But only 4 per cent of women have an orgasm with penetration. Did you google it? No, it's true. The clitoris has to be stimulated. Bea, you're the one with experience. Have they all got wrinkles and about 3000 veins showing? This woman has got a huge hole, doesn't she? So that she can fit that in... Oh my God. I can just about fit a tampon in. - That's not going to fit into me. - Yes it will. Don't think 15 year old boys' ones are like that. - My hole is about this size. - Well, use lubricant, Laura. So that it goes into you better. It slides in. Do I put it on or does he? You put it on him. On the tip. You put it on your hand and then... Like jerking him off? Well, as long as the guy is already like... But ifhe isn't... If he hasn't already got a hard-on? He'll get a hard on when you're making out. Boys are wasters. If not, just rub him a bit over his trousers and that's enough. But if we both mess it up and get it wrong? Listen to me. Humans have been fucking for millions of years. How are you not going to know how to do it? It's instinctive. That goes in and he comes. And that's all. I'm not going to know what to do. You go there, you do it and that's it. And how do we position ourselves? They are never going to take me up the arse. The missionary position is the best. And how do I know what the missionary is? He has to be on top. And you lying down? You lying down, with your legs open, and he's between them... And he puts it in you. But he's eating her juice, man! Yuck! - But we don't need to do that, do we? - No. I think it should be... I don't know, special. Well, more special than this. Of course, we are all going to do it together. Yeah, that's really cool. But with a boy who is at least... I'm just not sure. Boys have always done whatever they want to girls. Well not, this time it's us! One minute. Remember what we're doing here. Does it matter if we know the boys? Is that what's important about this? Yeah, but you're more relaxed if you do. No way! They're there for what they're there for. And that's it! Kleenex boy, it's as easy as that. So... it will slip, won't it? Well, you put on a bit of lube... But if you put on lube, you can't suck him off... One thing, I know we said that it doesn't matter who we do it with and all that, but would it be okay ifI did it with Yago? I don't know... Okay, fine. Do it with Yago. Are you sure? Of course, girl! You fancy each other. Loads. That's a good idea. What a cutie. Thank you so much, Marta. And the rest of us, how are we going to arrange it? - By a draw. - Why not? Voting papers. Okay, I'll go and get some paper. Girls, how about we share out the rest? Shall we open them? Who did you get? Who? Come on, telI. Luis. And you? Alberto. Javier. Roman. - And you? - Mario. Oscar. Well, that's that. And you, Aurea? Pablo. WelI... Today has been a very hectic day. We watched a porn film. I'll tell you about it tomorrow because I'm a bit traumatized and I'll tell you tomorrow. I'm going to sleep, I'm exhausted, okay? It's better if I tell you know. Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep. I knew what we were going to see, okay? But then they put it on, okay? And, well, like it all began as a bit of a joke. When the woman, like... When the woman was... touching his dick and the guy was saying "suck it, suck it... " And I don't know... The guy opens up her pussy and he begins to lick it and everything... I was like "What's he doing?" The woman had a pussy like this. And then when he came... Shit! Really disgusting. It's like... I don't know. People watch this and I don't know if it turns them on or what but it's disgusting, it'd make you vomit. Really, I could see the woman was suffering. And I'd say she wasn't feeling any pleasure because that fucking hurts. How could that not hurt? I don't know... Just thinking that I have to do that... It's like... It can't be like that. It can't be like that, can it? Well, I hope it's not like that because if it is... I had a bad time. Because... I thought, like... I want something that's more romantic, more, I don't know... With love and all that... and not like that. That's just wham, bam and thank you. No way, that's that. It's not going to be like that. It's my first time, it's going to be romantic and we're all going to do it together and that's that. Hey, look, Aurea! - See you outside. - Okay. How stylish! She's great, isn't she? Girls, the time has arrived. In the end it's going to be the whole class. So far, everything's fine. Nobody suspects anything. It's definitely going to be fine. Marta I want u to know that what we r doing is very important to me. This year is like history Without u nothing would have been the same. U've taught me to be a part of something With u and the girls I know I can get over any fear. I've learned that I'm never going 2 be alone Thnxs 4 everything I LUV U Today I held your hand And I won't let go Today my promise is true With an open hand I shout loyalty I promise you with this Thatmy heart won't change Write the truth to understand it And so escape from boring reality To do, to understand what we're planning Won't be easy at all Nights without sleep Working out our dreams and plans The cabin is really cool! What are you doing? - Come on! - Oh, please! - The bathroom is amazing. - Let's see? Oh my god! There's shit on the cushions! That's disgusting! There are little soaps in the bathroom! I'm going to keep them all, okay? I love them! I'm going to keep them alI, she says! What a thief! Can I have this cabin? I really like this column... - Wait. Let's shut the door. - I'm going to give Mario... - Hello! - Hello, Sandra. Hey, how is it going? - Good. - Awful! WelI... - I'm not going to like him. - Don't worry, you'Il be awesome! But with this down here. He'II be very excited! They will all be excited! - Paula? - Yes? - Are you okay? - Yes. What's this? Does anybody want something to drink? - I want a Coke. - A Fanta. - What is this music? - Check out the crowd! What a DJ! We're going to Majorca! Paula! we are aware that we can fill a void in just one instant and forever if we decide to awake the power, the power wilI be ours. Do you want me to go in with you? No, don't worry. I'm here, okay? What is it? I have been bleeding a bit recently. Since when? Three weeks ago. Three weeks. Okay. And the blood loss is abundant? What type of loss? Like the period? When was your last period? Take this. If you don't explain it to me, I can't help you. Maria... Come on, Maria, calm down. It was meant to be a secret... A secret? What secret? I'm pregnant. Well, don't worry. We'll work it out, okay? All the class is. Why have you done this to me? Keep still, it'll be just a moment. Seatbelts.
