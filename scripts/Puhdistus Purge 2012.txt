But not everyone can run fast enough. Or find a good enough hiding place. That's why you have to be alert... and stay completely still. You're quicker than me. You wanted to be part of my skin like a mole or a liver spot... or dirt, but you're nothing but filth! They put goddamn bait out there. If you're goddamn bait, you came to the wrong house. No. Stop. - Do I have to call a doctor? - No. No doctor. I'm alright. You don't seem alright. - Don't go anywhere or I'll call the police. - No police. - I haven't done anything. - Why were you lying there? - Where did you come from? - From Tallinn. He hit me and I ran away. - Who hit you? - My man. Pasa. Is he looking for you? You sure you don't want me to call the police? I'll leave soon. Where? Looking like that? Are you hungry? Come. We'll find you something. Speaking of work, what kind of a uniform is that? I waitressed at a hotel, but I quit. That must've been one hell of a fine hotel. What the fuck is that smell? You and you. Get out. Quick. Quick. Get in the car. - These are the girls? - Yeah. Damn 0ksanka. They sat a week on the train and 24 hours in the car. - Get in. - Go. - No way. - Get in the car. If you behave... I'll let you sit in the back before we get to Germany. This is it. Put your stuff in the corner. Follow me. This is the hotel? We'll clean and waitress here? No way. Fuck! You owe me. - Once you've paid, you can go. - I don't have money. You'll work and pay off your debt. The more you work, the sooner you'll pay it off. - What work? - You'll do the kind of work that pays. I own you. I'll add your clothes... room and board and training to your debt. You'll pay for everything. This didn't start off well. I'll have to add for acting stupid. You fucking idiot! You'll learn to whore. They all do. To Aliide from your sister, 1941. Koluvere village. Have you lived here long? Always. You live alone? Yes. Why do you ask so many questions? Maybe you're bait after all. - What? - No use pretending. You're here to rob me. You and your man Pasa. You're a mafioso's wife. Or a businessman's, as they call them nowadays. He's a smart man. Sent bait that's in bad shape. Who wouldn't help a poor girl like you? I better send you away right now. I'm not a thief. Pasa mustn't find me. Let me stay until morning. I asked because I saw your engagement ring. Martin died ages ago. How did he die? He died of bitterness. Why was he bitter? You're so young you wouldn't understand. I think my mom is going to die of the same thing. Martin was a good communist. And so am I. - Isn't Estonia free and independent? - Crap! They'll come back. They always do. Who? I'm a good communist. Is that why they wrote "Russkie" on your window? Why is your mother bitter? I don't know. She never talks about anything. She is practically mute. My grandma said my mom got scared of a bomb as a kid. What's your mom's name? Linda. What was your grandma's name? Ingel. She's still alive. I'll go get firewood from the shed. Don't you dare touch anything. Goddammit! - Stop. - I want to cut my hair short and get an electrical perm. - It costs two kroons. - Liide, that's silly. Besides, it wouldn't look good on you. - Yeah, because I'm not that pretty. - I didn't mean that. Soon you'll have to drive suitors away. Guess what? I'm sure something good is going to happen this summer. - How come? - I found a lilac with five petals. I ate it. Don't laugh. I ate it the right way. The prediction can't go wrong. Liide, hurry. I wish he'd look at me. Can you do me a favor? What? Watch him when he's with me. Watch his face and... look at the way he looks at me to see if he's in love. He is. You can see it from afar. True. But see if he looks at others or if he just sees me. I'm sure he sees something else as well. But there's no doubt he's crazy about you. I'll go help Mother with the laundry. Ingel was lucky she saw him first. She wasn't the first who saw him. What did you say? It'll be nice to have a young man around the house. May I have this dance? Friends, my dear wife, daughter and son-in-law. How a mother feels in her heart when her daughter gets married... is something only she knows. Women know it and so will you. They're taking Mother and Father. Where's our mother and father? They were sent where enemies of the people belong. Where? Where? From now on the crops from your field belong to the state. Ingel. Ingel. Say something. What are we going to do? - What if they take us? They've taken so many. - No. We'll always stick together. What about Mother and Father? They'll come back. Why don't we go to Finland while we still can. - Or Sweden would be even better. - I won't leave my home. The West will come and help us. Besides, Hans will move in. I didn't dare tell you before. I'm pregnant. Goddammit. Goddammit! Liide. I know you've been very worried about Ingel, but... it's over now. Come on in. It's a girl. We'll call her Linda. After Mother. - What's with her? - She was really nervous for you. I found her in the shed, praying that everything will go well. - What photo is that? - It fell from under the wallpaper. - You're in it. It says "To Aliide from your sister." - Bullshit. I don't have a sister. If you're Aliide, who's the other girl? - They called her an enemy of the people. - You mean your sister? I don't have a sister. The girl in the photo was a thief and a traitor. What did she do? She stole crops from the kolkhoz, was arrested and taken away. She stole from the people. Like the exploiters do. Crops? Why didn't she steal something more valuable? Sounds like she was hungry. Not evil. You don't know what you're talking about. Isn't it time to calm down? Around here guests either calm down or leave. I don't believe you. Where did she steal from? From the field. You can see it from the window. Why are you interested in what the thief did? Your sister stole from her own field! The field belonged to the kolkhoz. - Before it was hers. - Before this house belonged to fascists. You said you've always lived here. That makes you a fascist. Don't get me confused with your ravings! I was a good communist and so was Martin! Why did you stay when your sister was taken away? - Didn't that make you unreliable? - I've always done what I had to. We both should get some sleep. You can sleep in the little bedroom. I'll sleep here. I'll lock your door so that you don't get any ideas. I don't care. I'm used to sleeping behind locked doors. - Can you leave the light on? - Why? If I wake up, I want to see where I am. There's nothing to be afraid of. - They'll come. - How would they find their way here? - They always come. At night. - Who? - Men. - Bullshit! - We'll never get home. - Our debt will be paid off soon. I don't think so. - We've been here over six months. - Six months closer to freedom. My clients stink. They only try to hurt me. - I wanna die. - Katia. Listen. - We'll get out of here. - No, we won't. The debt is just an excuse to keep us from killing ourselves. He wants you. Put on the dog collar and the leash. It's the pervert. I can go. Katia's sick; She has her period. - He wants Katia. - It's okay. I'll come. Give me two of those fuckin' pills. Zara, you want some? Zara. Zara. Zara... I heard you wanna go home. Get on stage. Take your clothes off. Make it quick. You'll be a big star tonight. Get on all fours. Turn your ass to me. Spread your legs. More. Turn this way. Rub your pussy. I'm sure you understand what I'll do with the photos... if you mess with me? Please. Don't. We'll send them to your grandma. And to your parents. And then to your boyfriend. - Why? - I'll be back. As soon as I can. You're strong! Keep Ingel happy so that she doesn't worry about me. You're a good sister, always helping her. Do you really have to go? This time we'll drive the Russkies away alone. So far away they won't find their way back. That's all. Alright. They're here for us. You won't get me out of here alive. It's Hans. Berg and I left the Germans... and went to Finland and signed up for their army. We came home by boat last night. We parted just in case and I walked here through the woods. Why didn't you write us? We were worried. It's good you didn't write. The less there's black on white about you, the better. I'm sure you also understand that. We have to hide you or the Russians will kill you. Liide. - I'll join the Forest Brothers. We'll drive them... - Bullshit. We can build a windowless hiding place in the little bedroom. - I won't hide in my own country. - Can't you see what's going on? - Berg says... - He doesn't know anything. Hundreds have been killed and thousands taken to Siberia. I hope he's smart enough to stay in hiding. Is he back? Nobody knows. Liide is right. My duty is to defend my country and us. Please stay in hiding. At least for a week. - What is it? - Have you seen Hans? He hasn't been home since you all left. - We took the same boat back a week ago. - Haven't seen him? - Tell him we're gathering troops. - We need him. Let's go. - Where are you going? - To seize the town hall. You and five others? You're crazy. They'll kill you. No, they won't. Let's not tell Hans. He'd just run after them. Whatever happens to them, the militia will search every house. Hans has to run away into the forest. If the boys die, we're the only ones who know Hans is alive. Die. Die. Die. Seven Forest Brothers attacked us. Find the missing one. Calm down. I'll do the talking. - What if they threaten us with a gun? - Then they will. - What? - Let me take care of this. - What if they ask Linda? - She'll be in hiding. Calm down. - Hello. - Hello. - Would you like tea? - No thank you. Hans Pekk. Where is he? He's dead. He left with Berg in the winter two years ago. Berg came back alone. He said Hans was dead. It was a robbery homicide. Robbery homicide? Where? That's what Berg said. Ask him what happened. We don't know anything. The only things we know are hearsay. Ingel and Linda are crushed with sorrow. Jaan Berg is dead. You want tea or not? - Hell no. - Yes. In order to live you have to be dead. You get it? - It won't take forever. The West will help us. - I have to do this. - Try to understand. It's my duty. - It was also Berg's duty. And he's dead. - You can't keep running into the forest. - They won't catch us. - We're getting organized and we have more guns. - Dead men can't shoot. You have to stay in the house at all times. Be with Ingel. If someone sees you, Ingel and Linda will die immediately. Good. We have to arrange things. We'll build a wall here. We'll put the bed next to it. We'll make a hatch and put a cabinet in front of it. It'll be warm. And we can let people in the house. But we won't tell Linda about this. You can come out at night to bathe and eat when she's asleep. If she wakes up, we'll tell her you came to visit from the forest. The closet is so far away from the other rooms... that we won't hear anything. We'll put curtains on the windows so that no one can see inside. From now on I'll sleep here. Do you know where Ingel was taken? Comrade Aliide Tamm, where's Hans Pekk? He's dead. Are you sure Hans Pekk wouldn't tell your whereabouts... - if he was sitting in your place? - Hans Pekk is dead. He was robbed and murdered. Are you absolutely sure? Comrade Aliide, you know what I think? I think you were conned into helping criminals... and the criminals are so skilled... they got your innocent head confused. I ask you to save yourself. Where's Hans Pekk? - He's dead. - Tell me where the body is and we can end this discussion. Ingel would like to know that as well. She'd like to bury her husband, the father of her child... in a church cemetery. Why haven't we seen you at the Estonian Communist Party events? Don't you believe in the Soviet system? Don't you believe in communism? You haven't been brainwashed into fascism like your sister, have you? Remember that we all feel fear. We all make mistakes, Comrade Aliide. - What did they want to know? - About Hans. I didn't say anything. - What shall we tell Hans? - That they asked about Hendrik Ristla. That he got away when Berg and the others were killed. What if they interrogate us again? We did alright, didn't we? We'll do alright if it happens again. - What if they ask Linda? - She won't talk. She knows that her dad will die if she does. Look at me. Girl, goddammit. What's in the basket? Mushrooms. You took food to the bandits in the forest. No, I didn't. I was picking mushrooms. Right. Comrade Aliide, you're a disappointment. Look at me. I've done everything I can to help you. There's nothing more I can do. I'm not here. I'm not here... I'm not here. Socks. My socks. My socks. Grey socks. Dark brown socks. Black socks. Knee socks. Ankle socks. Silk socks. Children's socks. My socks. Liide. What happened? Burn my clothes. I didn't tell them anything. But they always come. Again and again. Should we send Linda away? Hans would become suspicious. We can't let him become suspicious. Not a word to Hans. Not a word. What did you do to your hair? We would've found a way to color your hair. I'll go make coffee. I won't be able to get back to sleep anyway. The sun will be up soon. I'll try to find a scarf you can wrap around your hair. - And some clothes. - It doesn't matter. I need to get to Tallinn as soon as possible. - I need a ride. - I don't have a car. I'm sure someone in the village has. Can you call someone? - I don't have a phone. - Why not? I don't have anyone to call. What if somebody wants to call you? Are you lonely? I've always been alone. But you had a husband. - You don't understand anything. - About what? About anything. And your questions bring back memories I've wanted to forget. What kind of memories? - They're here. The men. - Who? Everything's alright. Let's go. Open it. Go check the shed. - What is this? - Get in there. Quick. Don't get your pants dirty. What? - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. My friend and I have driven a long way. Could you give us water? The water here is good. The well is deep. What are you looking for? You know what I'm looking for. The cups are in the corner cabinet. There's nothing to steal here. I'm a police officer. Pasa Aleksandrovits Popov. - There are a lot of fake identity cards around. - What? I said there are a lot of fake identity cards around. It's healthy to be skeptical. Sometimes. I'd recommend you listen. For your safety. Have you seen a girl here? I haven't seen anyone. This is a quiet and remote area. Look carefully. Have you seen this woman? She's a dangerous criminal, but she can act innocent. She's done horrible things. How horrible? She killed her lover in his bed, in cold blood. She stole his car. This is a photo of the body. Think again. Have you seen the girl? No, I haven't. Look at the photos. I don't have to. I've seen bodies before. You live alone. You're totally defenseless. - How would she find her way here? - She's your relative. - Right. - Her grandmother lives in Vladivostok. Ingel Pekk. - She's your sister. - I don't have a sister. According to documents you do. This woman, Zara Pekk, murdered a man in this country. You're her only contact here. Of course she'll come here. She left her passport and wallet at the crime scene. She needs your help. - I don't have a sister. - Where's the girl? I don't know anything about any goddamn girl. Alright. Then everything's okay, right? Have a nice day. A mighty fortress is your shore Before you is an open sea Let Lenin's flag proudly soar And great Stalin will guide you to victory On this path of fortune march brave and true Our manhood and the will to fight Will ever be accompanying you We'll do it. Something fellow workers beyond the seas can only dream of. We'll bring heaven down to earth. We'll create a new human being. Together. This big dream was embodied in these two men. First in immortal Lenin. And now in Stalin. - Lenin! - Lenin! - One more time: Lenin! - Lenin! Lenin is life! Lenin is life! Lenin will always be with you. In hope. In joy. Lenin is in you. Lenin is in you. And in me. Could you teach me about Lenin and Stalin? You'll be my wife soon. I won't let anyone hurt my Aliide. He's a party organizer from Tallinn. You remember what the party has done to our family? I'll get a job. What kind of job? An inspector job. - What will you inspect? - I'll be collecting party membership fees. Are you crazy? People will start hating you. Will you? Martin will get me a nicer job when he moves up in his career. Are you so in love that you're blind? What will Hans say about you joining the enemy? I haven't joined anything. You haven't? What does Hans know about... lying in the town hall basement... - with piss running down your back, waiting for... - Stop. Everybody hates me. I don't deserve this. - I told you. - Everybody's really nice to Martin. What is it? You smell strange nowadays. It's Martin's smell. It stays. That's what Hans said. - What? - Linda, go outside to play. When you've been here, he says it smells like Russkies. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm just so... Hans is so restless. He's tired of hiding. Come. He threatened to go into the forest. I had to put those to stop him. - I'm afraid he'll go mad soon. - You can't hold him captive. - He shouts so loud you can hear him. - Did you hear what I said? It's for his own good. He's safe. Comrade Aliide Tamm. What a nice surprise. Martin's not home. He's in Tallinn. I know. I came to see you. I want you to come to town hall. Today. Interrogation at eight o'clock. I don't know what to think of you, Comrade Aliide. I find it hard to believe you are what you want people to see. Do you believe in Stalin? Yes, I do. I would really like to believe you do. But you have a background. Your parents, your sister and her husband... are fascists and saboteurs. Why do you see your sister so often... even though she helps bandits? - Ingel doesn't help anyone. - I just told you. Now you know that she helps bandits. So what do you think of her now? - I'm sorry, I don't understand. - Get up. I just told you the truth about your sister. You can tell me anything. It'll stay between you and me. We won't even tell your husband. Sit down. Your sister is an enemy of the people. I repeat. What do you think of her now that you know the truth? - Then I don't have a sister anymore. - What? - I don't have a sister anymore. - Excuse me, what? I don't have a sister. Very good. We'll get this unpleasant thing sorted out. We're slowly starting to build trust between us. You have a sister, but she's an enemy of the people. I'll write that down. Ingel has a daughter, doesn't she? Linda. Why? That's a pretty name. A pretty name for a pretty girl. It's a shame she has probably learned to lie like her mother. Linda is ten. She doesn't know anything. We better go. Where? To strengthen this budding trust between us. Mommy! Mommy! - Stop! - Mommy! Mommy! Take the lamp. Don't burn your fingers. Linda! Show me that you're worthy of my trust. Mommy! Mommy! Linda! Whore, take the lamp and put it where it belongs. Let me go! Let me go! Liide, are you sick? I heard you've been in bed all day. What is it? I feel sick. How did it go in Tallinn? We'll stay here. End of story. - I'm scared. - Of what? Don't ever leave me again. Or I'll hide so deep I won't find my way back out. Where? What are you talking about? Aliide. I love you. I'm ready to give up everything to be with you. - A house? - Yes. I'm tired of sharing a house. And because we're staying here. How will we get a house? This house? You sure? - No other house will do? - No. Alright. You know what that means? - They're leaving. - When? The date is at the top of the page. Do they know? Oh no. Otherwise they could run away. Only we here know. And now you. - Now we need evidence. - What evidence? They can come back if there's no evidence. If the evidence is strong enough, they'll never come back. We need a reliable witness. Are you sure? Yes, I am. Hans? It's me. Hans, come out. Hans. What happened? They took them. They took Ingel and Linda. I tried to get out. I'll go find them. Pack me a lunch. - I'll go get the pistol. - Hans. - Don't touch me. - Hans. - Let me go. - Hans. Let me go. Why, Liide? They don't need a reason. But I do. Maybe it's because... Ingel is your widow and you have a child together. They're enemies of the people. Because of me? You have to be patient and stay in hiding. What does it matter anymore? The Western nations will come and help us soon. They haven't forgotten Estonia. But before that happens... I'll try to get Martin to move here with me. What? No way. I don't want the smell of Russkies in my house. We better hope he says yes. It'll be easier for me to help you. They keep an eye on everything. On me, on this house. Ingel and Linda will come back. - That's right. - And Roosevelt hasn't forgotten us. Here we are. On the porch of our house. - Liide. - Yes? - Would you have wanted to move to Tallinn? - No. I like it here. Just wait till I get out, goddammit... - You old bitch! Let me out! - Stop lying to me. You hear me? Don't you understand? They'll come back! I do understand. How do I know who to believe? She looked better in the photos you sent me. If you don't want her, we'll take her with us. - She's pretty expensive. - Women are. Make up your mind. We'll leave for the hotel in two minutes. With her. I want to test her. Leave her here for tonight. I'll pay you in the morning. Okay. I don't care. Why is the whore still dressed? I want to see you naked. I want to see what I'm paying for. Take these handcuffs off! No. The whore will stay handcuffed. But I'll tie your hands in front of you so you can jerk me off. You're beautiful. Come sit on my cock. I love your breasts. I love them. Fuck! Die, you piece of shit! Die! Will you be alright? - I'm worried about you. - I feel much better already. I'll be home in the evening. Loves me. Loves me not. Loves me. Is it good? Not as good as Ingel's. - Have you heard anything from her? - No. - Have you asked people if they have heard? - I can't ask that. - You know that. Please finish your soup. - No. - You have to take a bath. - Why? - Let me shave you. - No. I'm sure you don't want to look like that... when Ingel and Linda come back. I dream of Ingel at night. Ingel and Linda aren't doing well. - They're suffering. - No, they're not. Martin has been to Siberia. It's nice there. They play music in the dining hall. There's an orchestra. There's a library and a newspaper reading room. Tell me more. Martin ate the same food as them in the dining hall... and the soup was more like a meat stew. - And women who can sew... - Like Ingel. They are hired at the dressmaking department... and they get a good salary. I can tell Martin to arrange a job like that for Ingel. - Can Martin do that? - Yes, he can. He'll do what I want. Tell him to bring Ingel and Linda back then. Be such a good wife that he'll bring Ingel and Linda back. Do whatever it takes. - You're asking too much. - Please. Nothing else matters. I wouldn't care if I died. I can't take this much longer. It's not enough to sleep with Ingel's nightgown. Her scent isn't enough. The nightgown isn't Ingel's. It's mine. - You've slept with it the whole time and haven't noticed. - You're lying. - I'm not. - Why? I had to give you a nightgown... because you whined and said you needed one. Why don't you ever come with me? Why not even this time? They're showing two films. - The first is The Battle of Stalingrad. - Again? It's really popular. I don't care for films. They make me uncomfortable. Why? They're not real. Real people are not heroes. I'll be home late. Liide. I was thinking of greasing these. For the winter. - What is it? - Sometimes I think I can still smell a kulak here. I've washed the curtains and sheets and everything. - The smell is strongest in this room. - No, it's not. - What if I stayed home? - Go. I know you want to. I won't. I want to be with you tonight. Films come and go. - You're wrong, by the way. - About what? About real people not being heroes. You're my heroine. Heroine of the fatherland. What do you mean? Because of Ingel and Linda. You did the right thing. I'm proud you're my wife. And you have to be proud of yourself. - Say it. - I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of myself. Liide. I'll go to Tartu tomorrow for a party meeting. I'll be gone for two nights. I think I miss you already. It's just you and me here. Ingel talks to me every day. It's your imagination. I just want Ingel and Linda back. I can wait, even if I'm buried alive. Forever, if I have to. I got you a passport. - You did? - They need workers in Tallinn. The factories have their own dormitories. I also got you a job. Will you go there and do as I say? Of course. You're an amazing woman. I'll give you communist magazines to read on the train. You'll look reliable. I'll leave tomorrow. Promise? Take the handle from the wall so that you can get yourself out. Liide. I have to leave now. What is it? You never asked... why I didn't make it to the Tallinn party committee. Even though I had such big plans... when we met. Why? They don't trust me. Is it... Is it because of me? My Liide. The time just wasn't right for us. Liide! What happened? I was just leaving. I got hit. - Goddammit! You went into the forest, didn't you? - I had to. They encircled us. The bullet scratched my arm. Stay awake. "Liide has been arranging things. She got me a passport. " "I promised to go to Tallinn and stay away from the forest." "She gave me an address and a lot of instructions. " "She was excited. But I won't go to Tallinn. " "I'm afraid to look at Liide..." because sometimes I want to point my pistol at her- "and pull the trigger. " Don't read it. I don't understand... - So you won't go to Tallinn? - No. I've arranged everything. I wouldn't leave without Ingel and Linda. I packed and everything. Not without them. Never with you. I did all that work. I would've forgotten all the trouble for just one kiss. For one sweet touch. For a day in a park in Tallinn with you. I just asked for one brief moment. I've always loved you. An eternity. And what do you do? You lie. I just wanted to spend a day in a park in Tallinn with you. Hand in hand. I even packed the right dress. Oh God. This will heal the wounds. It's been a long day. Way too long. Our asses are numb... from sitting in the car and staring at your shitty house. Where the fuck is the whore hiding? This game is about to change. Start talking or things are gonna get very unpleasant. Listen. We came here in the morning and what did we find? One granny. Two tea cups. Something's wrong with the picture, right? Tell me. Where is the girl? They're all dead. What? They're all dead. Hans Pekk is dead. Dear Ingel and Linda. The basement is full of jam and canned vegetables. I used our old recipes. I learned to make them after all. Even though you thought I'd never learn to cook. I've even gotten compliments. Yours, Aliide. - Calm down. - What happened? - Calm down. - I heard gunshots. I want to see that they're dead. They are dead. Come, let's go. What is it? What will I do now? You'll go home. You have your whole life ahead of you. You're free. And pure. Forget everything that's happened. Here's your passport. And a stack of dollars. I found them in Pasa's pocket. Walk to Koluvere village. It's one kilometer from here. You'll take a taxi to Tallinn and then a ferry to Finland. Remember to call Ingel and your mother. They can also get Estonian passports. Go now. Remember to do as I say. Here. Please give my regards to Ingel. From her sister. Thank you. Go now. Go. People run and escape as long as they have the strength. When they no longer have strength, they try to hide. But not everyone can run fast enough. Or find a good enough hiding place. Proofread by Rich Lyons
