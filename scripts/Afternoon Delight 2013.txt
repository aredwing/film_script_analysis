[MUSIC PLAYING - BOWERBIRDS, "IN THE YARD"] -How can I complain? Women in Darfur, you know, walk 14 miles to get water, raped on the way. And on their way home, just trying to get water back to the family, raped again, spill all the water, have to go back, probably raped a third time. I mean, how dare I? -How dare any of us? Rachel, do I need to remind you how much time you spend giving back? WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): You know what, if it's gluten-free and it is the same, how could it hurt? WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Eastside JCC Moms! What are we doing? -Packing lunch for the homeless! -OK, I'm gonna post this. When you get home, be sure to like it. OK? You have to share it with everybody. Get your friends to like it. I'm gonna see you guys at the auction? Rachel, I'm talking to you. -Yep, got it. -I know, it takes a lot of time. -And how are things with Logan? Is he good? RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Oh, Logan is awesome. -Are you two playing? I know you said you were having trouble getting on the floor with him and just playing. So fun just to get on the floor and just play with him. -And how's Jeff? -Yeah, all's well. -Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Good, good. Rachel, you don't have to tell me the truth, but, uh, it is your time. You pay for it. -Still no sex. Lost count. Six months. -I feel like there's a lot of couples that probably go through dry spells- -Not healthy couples, no. RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Instead of just, like, talking about the fact that we're not having sex, we use this code. He asks if he should put the dog out. -Hey baby. -[mumbling]. I gotta sleep. -Yeah, I know. I was just, uh, thinking of putting Bonnet out. -Um-- -Or you know, I could just let him stay in here. If you don't want me to. -It doesn't matter. -It doesn't matter to me either. -Well, let him stay. -You sure? -Yeah? -Yeah. -OK. LENORE (OFFSCREEN): Are you avoiding intercourse? -Bedtime? That is the worst time to have sex. -Is there a time you'd prefer? -Oh, like a 3:30, or 4:00 tea time thing. You know? Elicit. Curtains closed, sun trying to get in. We meet somewhere. -May I share something with you? When Portia and I met in 1979 at Smith College-- RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Does your shrink tell you about her life? -No, because if she did, I would fire her. It goes against her, like, Hippocratic Oath or something. -Oh my god, Lenore is always talking about her awful-- -Ugh, Lenore. --Lesbian partner Portia and how deep their love is. -Please fire Lenore. Ugh. -I bet they have eyes open orgasms. Looking into the eyes of your partner when he-- [gagging] -No thank you. -Oh god, I'm so ready just to say fuck you to that auction. I just do not wanna go. -Oh my god, me neither. -I'm buying a parking space for my horrible wife. No, I'm buying the parking space for my horrible wife. Ugh. Oh, gentleman's club. -Oh, well, yes, of course, because they are the most -Their little nut sack peeking out, and their tiny little monocles. -(POSH ACCENT) Top of the morning to you, ladies. Would you mind if I jacked myself off? -You ever been to a strip club? -Seriously? -Bo and I have gone to, like, a million strip clubs. -Are you serious? -Yes. We go there, we get all hot, and then we bang the shit out of each other when we get home. -Should I make a res? -What's wrong with you? -Let me guess. This was Steph's idea. -No, actually, it was my idea. I've never done anything like this before. It'll be hilarious. -You've never been to a strip club? RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): No. -Strip clubs are sad, and they make me the opposite of horny. They make me angry. -You don't think that looking at young, hot American tits are gonna get you horny? -How do you know their American? -They could be-- I don't know. You're not gonna know what hits you when you get home. It's gonna be sexual. It's gonna be oh so sexual. -Mm. -I'm gonna eat you alive. I'm might-- I might even suck it right off. -You don't know. -I do not know. It's gonna be good. -I'm gonna make some hot loving to your-- to your dad bod. -Oh, man. I wanted to bid on the Cuperbergs' condo in Maui and now I can't. -Jeff, you don't wanna stay at that condo. It sounds repulsing. -Yeah I do. It's in Maui. -You can't even see the ocean from that condo. Why would we stay there? -Jesus, Rachel, put on some clothes. Men wear those on their faces when they rob banks. -You press that panic button, I'm gonna shoot you in the face. Bing, bing. -Did you tell the babysitter what Logan likes for dinner? -All right, I'm gonna see if we have any of that frozen soy cheese pizza. -IDs, please. -Hi. Are you serious? -I can't tell with y'all nowadays. You know? -Best night of my life. -Oh my god, thank you. -Here you go. -Thank you. RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Making my day. [music playing] ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): Larissa. Let's give it up for Larissa. Come on up. [music playing] -How old are you? -I'm 19. -Oh my god, that's young. [music playing] -I had a baby. -That's OK. [music playing] -Hey baby. -I'm gonna put Bonnet out, OK? -OK. -No, of course we should. That's why we're-- Hold on a minute. -Wha? What are you doing? [vomiting] RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): I am so sorry! -That's OK. RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Honey, I'm so sorry. -It's OK. RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): I know this was the night. -It's OK. Did you do it to each other last night, or what? -I was puking and Jeff was tired. -Oh my god, you are gay and Jeff was gay. -OK, he might've tried to shove it in there. I couldn't tell you. Does Bo ever just fold it and mush it in? -Oh my god, like a soft response? Just sneak it in there? -Oh god, Jennie. -Hey. -Oh, I'm so sorry, my sister had a thing. -Yeah, mine did too. -So weird. -Hey you. -Matt bought me the parking space. -Of course he did. -Oh. -Yeah, I'll do it. -I do. -Wait, where are you going? -I booked a massage. ROBOTIC VOICE: Previous destination. [beep] ROBOTIC VOICE: Sam's Hofbrau. [music playing] -Uh, just one Americano, please. -What's your name? -Um, Sophia. Keep the change. Thank you. BARISTA (OFFSCREEN): Sophia? Thank you. Oh, hi. Do I look familiar to you? You gave me a lap dance last weekend. -Yeah, I remember. -Yeah, you came in with your husband, right? -Yeah. That's cool, I like that. -Yeah, you guys live downtown? -No, I like in Silver Lake. -Awesome. -Yeah. Um, I follow this truck on Twitter, which is how I happened to find this truck today. Because they tweet. -Yeah they do. Just my nom de coffee, if you will. -Oh. -I'm Rachel. -I'm McKenna. It's nice to meet you. -When I got out of college, I, uh-- I majored in journalism, but I kinda couldn't get my shit together, so I ended up working at this PR firm writing press releases about Calista Flockhart's buttery choc highlights. -Guys, who wants to try the new bar method place with me? -Oh, is that open? -Yeah, me I do. -I got a Groupon. Let's use it. -Uh, I can. What are you doing? -Uh, oil change. -So you know when you text somebody an emoticon? -So, this is just like that, except you're-- you're texting a tiny picture of your face. It's called an e-me-ticon. -E-me-ticon. Yeah, I just bought that. -Oh, that was Jeff. He's been trying to get something to hit. And now he's never not working, and I'm, you know, just online. -I had this one picture of him growing up. He was in this weird maroon sweatshirt and had these crazy sideburns. My mom told me that he had a genius IQ, so that's why she picked him, because it was good genes. But then one night, she got really drunk and she told me that was actually just a random photo and she had no idea who got her pregnant. -Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. You know, it's-- He's like a mystery to me. I get to imagine what he's like. I think he's like Axl Rose. [giggling] -Oh my god. You just snorted. -Yeah, it's not cute in any way. -It's so cute. -No, way too old for the snort. -No, it's cute. -You know what? I will have a cigarette. -OK. -Why not? -My lighter. Went out. Come here. Ready? -Yeah. -Oh, put your hand up. Yeah. -I remember why people do this. -Sophia? -Yeah. [car alarm ringing] -Hey! Wait! -McKenna! Are you OK? -Sorry. -Help me? -Yes. -Just fucking wait. This guy won't listen to me. -Do you have a key? My entire life is in this car. -That's my car, man! Hey, hey! What the fuck, McKenna? What happened? -Look, Walter. -Hey. -There's apparently 35 fucking tickets on this thing! -Wait. -I could've been arrested, man. -No, there was 10 tickets, tops. -Asshole! -No, hey! -No! -Hey, hey, hey, hey, my man! Yo, yo don't! No, don't. Fuck! God! You dumb bitch! -Did you get your stuff? -Yeah. -Sir. Sir, excuse me. -With all due respect, if the car had tickets on it, and it's your car, then I feel you're the responsible one. -Who the fuck are you? -Hey. That's my aunt Sophia. So be cool, man. -What the fuck are you gonna do with all your shit? OK, OK. Just walk away. We get it. We get it. WALTER (OFFSCREEN): Don't fucking move. -So. So you just put your stuff, um-- This is where you're going to be staying. First floor there's a bed where we-- RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Used to be the maid's room, but we don't have-- RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, welcome, welcome. Make yourself at home. -Oh, wow. Hey. Who is this guy? Hey, buddy. -That's Bonnet. -Hi cutie fruity patootie. That is the best name ever for a pup. -Let me show you-- Let me show you your digs. Oh man. Let's get some fresh air in this room! Oh. Sorry. Yeah, this used to be our live in's room. I know it's stupid to think that we'd need a housekeeper. I don't even have a job. But, you know, she was a godsend. Because when I got pregnant with Logan, you know, I thought, I'm not gonna have a baby nurse. I'm not gonna need any of that. You know, I'm gonna- I'm a mother. My body is built for this. And then came home, milk didn't come in. Tried and tried to nurse, couldn't latch on. Apparently my nipples are too small. So, he wouldn't stop crying for anybody except for Luce. And she's just so calm that she just-- Ugh. When Logan got into school, we had to let her go, you know? And then we maybe thought for a minute we were gonna have another kid, and then we-- or it was gonna be an office for me, or-- -I like this color. This room would look really good in this color. Do you ice skate? -Oh, these? Well, you know. For a hot New York minute. Got my-- My skate on. -My mom always told me that I should surround myself with good people if I want good things to happen. I'm 55 days sober, so good people are really important. -Oh my god. McKenna, that's amazing. Congratulations. Wow. -My mom's a witch. The Wiccan kind of witch, you know? Sometimes I think I might be one too. Is that my bathroom? D-d-- Do you need clean towels? We have company. -Go, go, go, go, go. I'm listening. -We have company. -Who's here? -Have you ever heard of the Espresso Yourself truck? -The coffee they make, Jeff, is like you cannot believe. You know when people just make one thing right? It's great. -It's obsession worthy. -OK. -So, I started-- I started to follow the truck on Twitter. -I thought you hated Twitter. -I don't hate Twitter, Jeff. I'm not-- I lurk on Twitter. -You're a lurker. -Just not a Tweeter. So, a few weeks ago, the truck was parked right across the street from Sam's. Wait, let me get you-- Let me get you some-- -Sam who? -Uh, Hofbrau. Sam's Hofbrau. That was the strip bar, or like, you know, topless place or whatever that we went to. Oh, you need cutlery. Anyway-- who would've thunk it-- ran into McKenna. -I don't know who McKenna is. -Oh, she, um-- She's the dancer that-- She's the dancer that gave me that private thingy when we were there. -You mean the stripper? -OK, sure. The stripper, is in the maid's room. -The stripper's in the maid's room. -Yeah. -How did the stripper get in the maid's room? -I put her there. So, I kept going back to the Espresso Yourself truck, and every time I would go there, I kept running into McKenna. So we just started talking. Anyway, she was, like, between apartments, her car was getting towed. She had nowhere to stay tonight, and you know all the work that I do for the homeless at the J, and, you know, I thought, here's-- OK, Here's actual homelessness right in front of me. -So you invited her to stay here in our house with our child? -Just for like a-- two nights. Like, one night maybe. You won't even notice she's here, Jeff. JEFF (OFFSCREEN): (WHISPERING) I don't wanna meet her right now. I think we should just-- -Shut up. Just a few days. OK, we gotta keep quiet. I love you. -Morning. -Uh, hey. Hey. -I remember you. You guys were, like, the cutest couple ever. -Oh, thank you. We work at it. Actually, we don't. Do you want some coffee? -Um, do you have tea? -Yeah. -Oh, wow, look at this, a tea box. -We're sort of-- sort of hooked up that way. -Yeah. I'll take a chai spice. -Yeah, why not? I have to say, that was, like, the best sleep I've had in five years. Not joking. Hollywood is so noisy. -Yeah, sometimes I find the birds in this neighborhood can be rather cacophonous. You know, loud and chirpy. -Rachel told me that you invent apps. -She wasn't lying. MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): I love apps. MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. -Yeah? -You like your job? -Um, I used to. I recently sold the, or got bought, merged. There are any number of ways to describe what actually went down with Happy Farm. Logan, hey. -Buddy, this is McKenna. She's, um, uh, a friend of your mom's. I've heard a lot about you. -Yeah? I love your monkey backpack. -I asked for an elephant. -Well, talk to your mom. -I did. -We're gonna get you hooked up with breakfast real quick, Mr. Man, because we are running a little late. -OK. RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Hey. -Hi. RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Uh, good morning. Logan, you met my friend McKenna? -Yeah. McKenna, Jeff. You got it. -Great. How did you-- How did you sleep? -Really, really good. -Oh good. Oh good, you-- Good. -Quiet in here. -Yeah. So, um, uh, you can take Logan to school today? Jeff, I just want to make sure that McKenna is-- -Got it, I am on it. --taken care of. -Thank you. -OK, great. You need milk. -OK. OK, she looks like a completely different person, -I know. -She looks like a college kid or something. -Right? Dancing is just her job. A job does not define who you are. -Right. -I really think I can help her. She had a really difficult life. -Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy. OK, all right. I'm shaking it out. There's a stripper in my pool. No big. -OK. Oh, that's a nice looking one. -Yeah, is that OK? What do strippers like? -Not that, because she's sober. -Oh. Good for her. -Imagine that you're cleaning out a rim. -OK? -Cleaning out a rim. It's a big rim. It's more like a trash can size. -OK. -Oh, like a garbage can rim. -Her shame is trapped there. We gotta get that exercised. Be gentle with it. -Shame. -Stephanie! -I really got this. -Stephanie! -You're waking up in the morning. -Should we give her a pole? -You want-- -Oh shit. -Yeah. -Body. -No, you guys. -Those are the guys that come in and they're like, lap dance, lap dance, lap dance, every night. And they always have their favorite girls. And they're the ones that tell you things like, oh baby, I'm gonna be the one that gets to see you for real. I'm gonna help get you down off of this pole, blah, blah, blah. We call them Captain Save-a-Ho. -Captain Save-a-Ho, that's hilarious. -Yeah, I made $6,000 of one once. -Wait, 6,000 just for dancing? -Well, some girls dance just to dance, right? But I like to use the club for networking, meeting people, building relationships. I'm not the kind of girl who's gonna tell you that she'll strip but she won't get naked, or she'll give you a lap dance but she won't touch you, or she'll touch you, but she won't give you oral. I'm pretty much down for anything. Full service sex worker. -Um, what-- What is a sex worker? This one guy Warren, I mean, he pays via Paypal. It's awesome. There's no cash exchange. It's very clean. And then there's this Jack, and he's been my regular on Tuesdays for like a million years. I love him like a brother. He's your kind of run of the mill, typical vanilla kinky guy. He's into some weird shit. He sometimes likes a girl to watch. You should come, Rachel. -Yes, you should. You really should. I'll take Logan to soccer so you can go. -Thank you, that would be a huge help. Sorry. I'm gonna ruing a perfectly good blow out. Hey Captain Save-a-Ho. She's a hooker. -Sh, it's OK. -No, it's not OK. -Yeah it is. -Is that a nursing bra? -Oh, yeah. -Logan's five. Throw it the fuck out. -You didn't know about that part, right? The friends I see sometimes? -You were right about that. -You still want me to stay at the house? -If you want out of that life, I can help you. -I mean, I've saved first and last month's rent. I could give that to you. And I could help take care of Logan. -Exactly, but no money. -I'd feel weird taking something from you. If you think that I can help you, I promise, you're not taking. -It's inappropriate. -Aren't you supposed to be non-judgmental? I'm supposed to be clear mirror, baccarat crystal. Excuse me, I have to eat something. I was recently diagnosed with perimenopausal low blood sugar. I brought quinoa from home. -She just seems way too young and, I don't know, healthy to be spending her time having sex for money. -Isn't that her choice? May I share something? When Portia was in graduate school-- -No, Lenore, I don't wanna hear about Portia. I think that's inappropriate. -I don't know why I wanna take care of McKenna. I mean, what if I listen to you and I'm like, oh, Lenore says it's inappropriate, so I guess it's inappropriate. So I go home and I'm like, sorry, McKenna. Turns out, this is inappropriate. So, out she goes, back on the street, robbed of her one opportunity she had to finally escape from being a sex worker. -What's a sex worker? -That's what she calls it. -She's a prostitute. -That is such an awful word. -It's a highly accurate word, Rachel. -I think I need a break from therapy. -Well, I think that's ill advised. Just last week, you were complaining about how you and Jeff are no longer making love. I mean, if you wanna choose words, let's just call it not fucking. -I think you should start coming in twice a week. -Mwah. -Bye. Oh, hey. Uh, this is, uh-- This is, um, Amanda and Meredith. -Nice to meet you. -Bye. -Stephanie. -Oh, McKenna. Oh my gosh. You're still here. -Yeah, uh, um, I'm teaching her about drop offs in case she has to do a drop off. Well, I'll see you guys soon. -OK, bye. -If it's a Monday, you wanna bring his math stuff with you-- -And if it's a Friday, you wanna-- Did you ever get my sign up paper for Craftacular? -Oh. -Because I didn't see your name. -I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I forgot. -Hi. Who's this? -Oh, uh, this is Logan's new nanny. This is McKenna. -McKenna, this is Jennie. -Oh, nice to meet you. -Wow, you been thinking about going back to work Rach? -Yeah, thinking about thinking about it. JENNIE (OFFSCREEN): Great. Where you from? -I'm from Chico in Northern California. -Yeah, I found her through an agency. -Well, careful, because I am known to steal nannies. I am a nanny stealer. Hey. Do you wanna-- Do you wanna captain a table at Craftacular, McKenna? It's, like, a lot of kids doing crafts, raising money for Jewish women with cancer. -Jennie, I am so sorry, but I gotta show McKenna where the dry cleaners is. It was nice to meet you. -I'll register. I promise. Just like another week, until she gets on her feet. What exactly do you intend to do for her? -Help her tell her story. Maybe I can help her set up a blog. She and I could co-blog. -You wanna-- You wanna blog with her? A lot of good things have come from blogging. -Name one good thing that's come from blogging. -OK, that crunchy kale salad that I made. That was from someone's blog. Blogging's amazing. -So, and we are recording. OK. So, we are not sure what this is going to be yet, if this is gonna be a blog, a co-blog, article, podcast. We're going to just-- Who knows? Keep it loose. Right now we're just gonna have a-- just a-- just going to call-- call it a conversation. -Yeah. -OK. You are a sex worker. -Yes. I'm a sex worker. -And you have been, uh, working in sex for how long? -Two years. I started when I was 20. -You told me you were 19. I tell all my customers that. It's like, a barely legal thing. It turns them on. -What does it mean to see other people as customers? -Doctors have customers, psychiatrists have customers, people that work in stores have customers. A lot of people in this world have customers. -What if those customers had wives? -So? -You didn't feel a sense of responsibility or-- -No. -Sisterliness? -No. -Compassion? -Yeah, I feel compassion for a world where men have a way higher sex drive, and it's a proven fact, and their wives lose interest in having sex with term. Yeah, I feel compassion for that. -Oh my god. -Thank you for coming home. -Thank you for calling me home. This is not at all what I had scheduled for my afternoon. -Hey. -What? -Open your eyes. -What? -Do me a favor. Open your eyes. Hey. Hi. -You wanna try having an eyes open orgasm? Yeah? Like this? -There you are. -Hey, hello, how are you? -Hey, long time. You know what? Close them. -I'm sorry. Just keep them closed. -Do what you gotta do. -Sorry. -Oh, I'm good. -Yeah. -I can get back in there. -No, no, no, no, no, no. -No? -Takes a second to get back on the bus. -Yep. -Been a while. Glad we did it though, so. -Yeah, yeah. -Nice work. -Right. -Um, so, I can when I get back later tonight from work. Yeah? -Um, actually, I'm gonna be much later than I thought. -No worries. -Because I had to reschedule this conference call and I have to-- [phone vibrating] -Hold on. Someone's calling me right now. Hello? Yeah, hey. This is Jeff. If they're still on the call, I need you to patch me through right away. --We're running late, honey. -My legs are stuck. -Logan. Logan, you have to help me. -Flex your legs. Let go. [knocking] -Mhmm. MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Hi. MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Jeff said that you were sick. -Oh, I feel Shit City. I'm all right, I think. -You know your body's not gonna heal if you mind's tweaking. -I'm not-- No, wait, I-- McKenna, I have to reach out. I have to reach out to hot dog vendors for this Craftacular or Jennie is going to kill me. MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Do you have any of that menthol rub stuff? Do you know what I'm talking about? -McKenna, I'm fine. -Ah, ah, ah. You do have it. -McKenna, I don't need anything. -Do you have a sock? -Can I use these? -I mean, those are gross. I don't know what you're even. -Smells fine. -You don't have to do anything. -OK. -I don't even-- -Give me your foot. -Again, honey. Please, I am total-- -Put it down. -I am fine. Lay down. -Lady. I am fine. -OK? Just pause. OK. My grandma used to do this to me and my cousins when we were sick. RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Grandma. -Yeah. Grandma Ninny. -Did you say Ninny? -Mhmm. My mom's mom. I lived with her a lot. You have to keep your feet warm. -You do not have to do this. -Makes me happy. I can feel in your feet where you're blocked. In your right hip. We'll just shake it out. OK. Just shake it out a little. Oh yeah, it's really right in here. [whispers] OK. Can I open this? -Um. I'm not wearing a bra. -Just breathe. [heavy breathing] [heavy breathing] -Hey, cute dress. -Thanks. -You look so pretty. Where you going? -Do you really wanna know? -Of course. -I'm going to play with Jack. -Oh, is that the-- Is that the Paypal one, or the-- MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): No, he's the other one. -Oh, the nice one. MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Mhmm. -Oh, good. OK. Are you sure you wanna go? -Yeah, my mom called. Um, she's getting evicted, so I need to make her some cash. -But I mean, if you-- I you want me to pay you instead of the room. I make $250 an hour. -OK, well I know you're not asking for my permission, so. OK, bye. -Bye. -See ya. Do you need a ride? OK. OK. Are you sure you don't need a ride home? He always calls me a cab. -Oh. MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Thank you. Bye. -Bye. -Hi Willy. RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Are you kicking the table? LOGAN (OFFSCREEN): Mhmm. -Stop. It's rude. Thank you. The road to dessert is paved with chicken, sir. -That's right. I really want dessert. -And you're gonna get some. -Stop kicking the the table. -The road to dessert is also paved with beef. Come on. [door opening] -There she is. -McKenna, you hungry? Plenty of food. MCKENNA (OFFSCREEN): Uh, no thanks. I'm gonna go straight to bed. Good night! -OK, sleep tight. -Finally. Oh my god, wow. Look at you. You look unbelievable. -Hey baby. Look what you did. I'm proud. -You did so good. -Wow. I'm so proud of you. -Take it easy Horn Dog McCrosby. Look, Rachel's got her boobies out. -What the what, Rachel? -Come over here. Make a little Matty sandwich. -OK. -Hold on. Everybody. -All right, we gotta go. -All right, where's your mansicle? -Uh, you mean Jeff? He's over there. -Sup Jeff Boyardee? JENNIE (OFFSCREEN): This way. This way. Excuse me. -Yeah? -Don't freak out. OK. Get a bracelet on this one. -Oh, yep. -And, uh, I don't mean to be unkind, you guys, but I sweat, if I see anybody walking around without a bracelet, I'm gonna shit myself. -Yeah, I-- I'm really sorry about what happened last year. -No, don't even worry about it, because Actually, that was completely your fault, but I'm totally over it. All right, I want you here with Amanda, and just figure out between the two of you who's gonna do bracelets, who's gonna take credit cards. -Uh, I'm-- I'm doing hot dogs with Stephanie. -Oh, honey, all due respect, you kinda dropped the ball on the hot dogs, so I gave it to Alisa. Sorry, I-- I need to borrow my husband for one second. I'm so sorry. -What? -You're leaving? -Yeah. -Because that's how it works. The women tell the men where to set up the folding table, and the men set up the folding table so men are free to go. -That's gross. -Just hang with Steph, OK? Talk shit about the moms. You guys'll have fun. -I'm off of hot dogs. -You don't get to make fun of me and go surfing. I'm with fucking kosher Amanda. This is fucking kosher Amanda's face all the time. -You're right.
