The bad guy had Air Jordans on. It was no contest. What about Jerry Lee ? He needs four little Air Jordans too ? You mean they make those for dogs ? That was a rhetorical question. You know, Captain, you should let people know when you plan to be rhetorical, 'cause your tone of voice never chang es. You think you're funny ? Sometimes. This isn't one of those times. Jerry Lee, he just hit me ! Quit bein' a smart-ass. Tell me what happened. Again ! The bad guy had a full body armor on. That should have given you the advantag e. It was that lightweight stuff. What can I tell you ? The guy had a rocket up his ass. What the hell is that ? This here ? U h, this was the shooter's. This is a modified M-1 6. A company named Armaments 2000 does the retrofit. It's apparently for military use only. How do you know all that ? I'm trying to better myself by taking night seminars. Ah, shut up, will you ? You better sit down. You look pale. Probably because you hit me. And give that dog there a drink of water. Jerry Lee is fine, and so am I. You don't look fine. Sit down before you fall down. Now. Detective Harris ? Yes. It's the smog ! Take this to the lab and check it for prints, okay ? You know, Dooley, every time you g o someplace lately, people try to kill you. Well, I'm a popular guy. Look, I'm serious here. You've lost three suspects in three weeks ! Come-- You are either out of your league... I am not out of my league. or you've lost a step. What are you talking about, ''lost a step'' ? You should have taken time off after Tracy died. - That has nothing to do with it, Captain. - Oh. Are you sure ? Absolutely sure. When was the last time you had a physical ? Physical.

[ Devon ] Tracy told me you read my manuscript. [ Dooley ] Yeah, I did. I didn't read the whole thing. I read the first and the last chapter. That's really all I had time for. [ Devon ] The first and last chapters ? [ Dooley ] I g otta tell ya, uh, it's-- it wasn't really that real. [ Devon ] It wasn't real ? [ Dooley ] No, it wasn't real.

Have you noticed any chang es in him ? Yeah, he doesn't chase the little chuck wag on across the kitchen floor anymore. Any loss of hearing or smell ? Well, that depends on what you mean by ''any.'' Well, maybe sometimes, a little bit. Well, there's nothing wrong with your dog. Really ? He's just suffering from the effects of aging. You should slow him down a bit. Why ? Would you send your grandfather out to try and do your job ? I wouldn't send my grandfather to microwave popcorn. So why would you send out Jerry Lee ? 'Cause my grandfather's too old. - So is Jerry Lee. - What do you mean ? Look at him. He looks great. Do you know that do gs are leading long er and healthier lives these days ? Where did you hear that ? Seminar. At night. I try to better myself. Oh, you're trying to better yourself ? Maybe you should g et a checkup. You've g ot high blood pressure. Your face is bright red. That is a drinking problem ! Well, what do you know ? You're a vet. You both need to be on special diets. The same one ? No. You should be on a low-fat, low-sodium diet. The dog needs to be on a senior maintenance meal plan. [ Whining ) What the hell's that ? Lamb and rice for older dogs. It might give him some flatulence for a week or so, but nothing to worry about.

Less filling, and it won't slow you down. And Dooley, you better pay attention to the ''won't slow you down'' part. I could have beat you running backwards, old man. - What do you want ? - Don't tell me you haven't figured it out yet, Detective. Three times in three weeks, Dooley. I could have taken you out anytime I wanted. I want you to know how it feels to have someone else control your destiny. Jerry, down ! How it feels to have someone else destroy your life. What do you want ? It's hard to lose a loved one. Isn't it, Dooley ? But then, sometimes life just has a way... of kicking you in the face, just when you think you've g ot it made. Hey, why don't you come in. You and I, we can have a beer, we can chat. And then I'll bust your ass. You're in no position, literally, to start playin' bad guy, Dooley. - [ Growling, Barking ] - [ Motorcycle Engine Revving ] [ Dooley ) ...about my car. Hey ! Jeez ! Jerry Lee ! Come here.

Don't listen to him. - [ Whining ) - Lay down, Jerry Lee. - [ Whines ) - What's with him ? What ? He's not a morning dog. Listen, last night the shooter called. Took a shot at me. H it my beer. Why didn't you call it in ? I g ot another beer. But wait a minute, he said something weird. Something really strang e. He said, ''It's hard to lose a loved one, isn't it ?'' - Is he talkin' about Tracy ? - I don't know. Could be anything. Could be a reveng e act, it could be somebody I know. - I-I-I don't know. - Harry Stipe. Harry Stipe. He swore that he would g et you after what happened to his brother ! No, Harry Stipe's doin' five to ten. Not anymore. He g ot paroled. - Harry Stipe is out ? - Yeah, it just came in. - Stipe is out, and nobody told me ? -J ust came across my desk. Give me the parole officer's name. I want his address. Not so fast, Dooley. Come on ! Give it to me. Sit. [ Whines ) There's some guy out there gunnin' for you.

Sorry, I didn't know. - Good, you two know each other. - Yeah, we had a moment a little while ag o. - Before he, uh-- [ C oughs ] - [ M umbling ) Look, I don't see what that dog is g onna do that Jerry Lee can't do. Z eus ! [ Speaking Dutch ) [ Speaking Dutch ] Very impressive, Welles. - Dooley ? - What ? He was trained in antiterrorist tactics. Could he g o into a mini-mart and pick up a six-pack of beer ? He attacks through windows. Well, Jerry Lee has mastered Windows '98. Got his own chat room. '' Dogs for Dogs'' ? [ Shouting I n Dutch ) Jerry Lee can do that. You can do that, can't you ? [ Whining ) Captain ? I really don't think this is a g ood idea. -I couldn't agree more with her. -Dooley shouldn't even have that dog. He's not trained as a canine officer. He's a dog with a pet. - [ Growls ) - Ooh ! Aren't we a little moody ? - [ Growls ) - Z eus and I can handle this case alone. I g ot news for you. Once I g et a parolee's address, this case is closed. Then I g ot news for you. A parolee doesn't even fit the profile. Profile ? What is this, an Olympic moment ? This is a police investigation here. Really ? I wouldn't have guessed. You don't need a profile to catch a bad guy. All you need is a g ood cop with g ood instincts. I'm glad you said ''g ood cop,'' because so far, your instincts suck ! You two are g onna g et along great. Dooley, I need to talk to you alone. No offense, Serg eant. No offense taken, Captain. See you outside, partner. Hey! If you're g onna ride with me, g et out of that uniform and be on my desk in five minutes. ''At.'' He meant ''at.'' No, I meant ''at.'' ''At. '' At my desk. ''At.

He wouldn't last five minutes with me-- I'd kill him ! Look, he probably doesn't even drink. I don't need a new dog. You know what I need is a bigg er gun-- one like this. Will you put that away, you idiot ? Or one like this. Where did you g et this ? This-This is L.A., not Dallas. How about this one ? Look, I g ot a guy out there with an M- 1 6 takin'shots at me, and all I g ot... is this. Dooley, firearms, that's not the problem. The problem is Jerry Lee. What ? Well, if he misses a step, you could lose your life. Don't you understand ? That's why I'm giving you both new partners. I read that vet report. The vet report said you were in the best shape you've ever been in your life. Alert. Responsive. He's a killer ! You're a stud dog, Jerry Lee. - [ Whines ) - See ? You see that ?

''Was last night as g ood for you as it was for me ?'' - Who gave you these ? - The delivery guy. - What did he look like ? - Green pants, black belt. You saw him from the waist down, that's it ? I was sittin' in-- What are you doing ? Touching evidence again ? Puttin'your prints all over this ? Listen to me. You see these gloves ? I want you to wear these things. Forever ! Yeah. - Okay. - Take these down to the lab and have them dusted. [ Welles ] Z eus ! C ome ! Come on. Let's g o. That Welles and that stupid psycho dog is probably sittin' up at the desk. You and I can g o g et the bad guys ourselves. Hey ! We were just looking for you. Weren't we, Jerry ? Check this out. If you look at the holes, they actually spell out something. It says, ''Even though I'm older and slower, I'm still the same asshole as I was before. '' Very funny. That's very funny. You think that was funny ? [ Sighs ) Come on, Jerry Lee. Z eus ! [ Dutch ) I can do that. All right, look. I want to g et one thing straight... before we g o on here, all right ? What went on between you and me is history. Now, you have g ot to let it g o.

You're so irresistible, how could I not think about it ? Well-- Because, you know, it was one night. Heat of the moment stuff. Absolutely right ! Right. Get in. [ Sighing, Swearing I n Dutch ) What was that ? What ? Nothing. And you, dog, let's g et one thing straight between you and me, all right ? N umber one: No barking, no drooling, no f-- passing of gas... or performing any bodily functions in or about my car. N umber two: You always sit in the back seat. N umber three: Never give me any lip. - [ Growling ) - That's neg otiable. That's neg otiable. J ust relax. Jerry Lee, watch him. Ticket ! Look at that ! I think she follows me around. J ust put it in the glove compartment. Dooley ! How many parking tickets do you have ? Put 'em in the glove compartment and shut it. Do you know how to park a car ? Shut it ! [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] U gh, I'm g onna need a tetanus shot from just sitting in this car. [ Engine Starts ] [ Dooley ] We're g oing to Harry Stipe's. We're g oing to arrest him, and you'll never have to see me again, all ri ght ? Fine. [ Dooley ] Your do g likes to look through windows ? He attacks through windows. [ Dooley ] Yeah, but can he sing ? [ Welles ] What ? Jerry Lee can sing. [ Chuckling ) Yeah, right. [ Dooley ) Home, home on the rang e [ Jerry Lee Howling ) Hear that ? Come on, Jerry Lee. Where the buffalo-- [ Howling Continues ) [ Welles ] I'm tellin'ya, he's not the guy we're lookin'for. And how would you know that ? Because he doesn't fit the profile. Profile. [ Clears Throat ) Welles, this is a profile. A profile is only g ood when you're trying to narrow down suspects. We need a list of suspects first. It's not him. Okay, then. Stay in the car. And you too. You stay. Jerry Lee ? Let's g o. [ Growling ) We are not staying in the car. - Don't look at me like that. - Look at you like what ? Not you. H im. I g ot a weapon. I'll use it. We are trained K-9 officers. We don't do ''stay in the car.'' Why don't you... and your little puppy g o in through the back ? He's not a puppy. And why do we have to g o in the back ? Why don't you ? We don't do back doors. Come on ! [ Barking ] [ Muttering In Dutch ] [ Shouts In Dutch ] Wow. Look at this. You know, I hear they're converting this to condos ?

Oh, M r. Big Shot decided to run away. All right, so, jump in the car. We'll g o look for him. Z eus will seek him out. No, no, no, no. He has to come to me. That's the prodigal son. He's g otta g o and come back. I would be doing him damag e if I went and chased him down the street. I am not g onna do it. [ Whistling ) Jerry Lee ? He's just been actin' so weird. Did he ever run away before ? No. He's very sensitive. Just like you. I'm not sensitive. He's sensitive. I'm-- [ Barking ) I'm just moody. [ Dooley ) Jerry Lee ! Well, maybe Byers is ri ght.
