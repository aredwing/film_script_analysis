He will play with you. - Do you speak English? - Yes, I speak. My language skills not a problem. - Where are you? - I'm from the Dominican Republic. Dominican?? I was there several times. Dancing merengue. And drinking lots of rum. I once had a girl there. Long time. What was his name? Shit. I have to stop drinking. It sucks memory. Never mind. Take the bag, we're leaving. Yes, sir. Be careful with this. I could kill someone. - Hopefully not necessary. - Did you say something? No, sir. We will do nine holes, while the field is empty. Now I remember his name. Isabel. Isabel was his name. Help! Hands off me! Help me! - Calm down. - Who the hell are you? - Does not matter. - What the hell do you want? Relax, Julia. No one can hear. Just calm down. I do not want to hurt you. Did you know that a woman your age and weight, can pass between 20-30 minutes in the heat, before starting to dehydrate and lower your blood pressure? Who are you and what the fuck do you want? I want the truth, Julia. And no lies. - The truth about what? - About Isabel. Do you remember? I know of no Isabel. Who is Isabel? Are you sure? Miguel? Here? Does anyone know where is Miguel? Man, I'm talking about. What's your name? Tell me your fucking name! - Raul. What do you want? - Where is Miguel? - Shit, why did not you ask? - I did. On the fifth floor, man. Thank you. Hi, honey. You want to talk? - Do not move, Miguel! - Bravo. Put the gun down, Daniel. Me not need it. I'll tell you everything you want to know. How do you know my name is Daniel? For 15 years I know this day would come. I want to know everything about Isabel. I'll make some coffee. It will be a long story. All that want to know about Elizabeth ... began in his native country. In Capotille. Great business opportunities, everywhere! You have to order champagne if you want me to stay with you. You can order the same Isabel would have ordered. Who is Isabel? Do not tell me that the forgotten so soon? It only took 15 years. - You will invite the lady with champagne? - She knows what I want. Get me a Dom Perignon with a portion of strawberries. All right. Credit card and identity. That should do it. Tell me about Isabel. Isabel has long since not around. I want to know everything. Just start at the beginning. Miguel had hired. He thought it was a gold mine. I went to look for it and I talked to her. 15 years ago the police interrogated me. - The investigation was closed. - I know the story. - Never found the murderer. - Do you think I killed her? Never. Isabel loved. He adored her. Are you sure? How to you love your wife? You do not understand. When you're my age, you'll understand that not everything is as it seems. Isabel was a very special woman. What do you remember her? I used to tell stories about his life in his native country. Very sad. It was there that he met Miguel. - Miguel Contreras? - Yes He played baseball, before club owner ... and began to be a pimp famous among the rich. He was the son of a bitch contraband brought here. - Miguel? - Isabel? Isabel worked very hard to have money to treat your child. He worked as a cook in a cafeteria. But all in vain. It was very difficult for Isabel. Even his prayers to God have avoided his fate. The boat trip It was not easy ... especially when there a storm at sea. People supports amazing things to come here. I saw her again a couple of days after arrival. Michael asked me to look after her, so I had to help her. Teach them do their job, what I like to call, the secrets of prostitution. Walk. James. - But what have we here ... Hi, Daddy. I hit the jackpot! Welcome to my fucking room. Your host for today will be Mr. Kuk! - Welcome. - Enter. Hi, Daddy. Very beautiful. Isabel at first afraid. Quiet. Do not be nervous. Today I feel the luckiest bastard ... this whole fucking empire. This will be fun. Yes, it will be fun. - James ... - God! - Look at her. - Look at that ass! Everything will be fine. It will be so good and fun, is not it, James? Yes, of course. Go back to bed. - Damn bitch! - What the hell are you doing? You bit me, fucking bitch! It's the same every time you bring someone new. - Enough! - Son of a bitch! - Shut up, you idiot. - Are you going to pick up or scream? After that night, Isabel, quickly entered the game. Do not stop! Keep it up. This is very good. Thank you. Here you go. It was spectacular. It became very popular. Everyone wanted to be alone with her. It was the new cat in town. He stayed with a lot of my clients. It was the best thing is that work in the world. Elizabeth was a very good whore. Generally no fuck with prostitutes. I let Raul fuck her with his big cock. He said that Elizabeth was as good whore which could be for days fucking her without interruption without tiring. A pussy like that not easily find. You seem to be very proud of your delusions. Deceptions?? This is a tough business. Whores Pass smuggling not like it was before. When I brought her to Elizabeth, whores smuggling was to the nearest coast. In the worst case, all you had to Coast Guard bribe. The girls were given ... one false social security card, dead people, who had died in sites as Minneapolis on New York. And suddenly ... Americans were so as George Washington. Yes, they were good times. Log whores smuggled into the country. What do you mean good times? The September 11th changed all that. Now I have to bring whores from the border with Mexico. Go across the border and then come back. The travel expenses, bribes, paperwork. It's too much work. Now, it's just capital investment. And as a good businessman, I protect the value investment. And the value is calculated on the basis of their relationships ... with customers in the clubs. My rules are very clear. I offer shelter ... Food. Food. You are very beautiful. I'm his agent, her pimp and protector. I am the mother, the father and God. Not speak English. It is not difficult, and learn. Come on, move. Baila! I told you to dance, you fucking bitch! Do you feel like dancing, right? Now listen to me, bitch. Like to play rough? Look at me. When I dance, you dance, right? So better you do. Did you just spit, dirty whore? Do you realize what you did, bitch? Look at me! Dominican whore! Who the hell you think you are? Do not mess with my girls. Out! I can not have a little privacy? Nobody messes with my whores. Apologize. I will not apologize! She's a whore. - Apologize! - Agreed. Sorry. I'm sorry ... Get out of here, you fucking pig! Raul! - Clean this shit! - Why do I have to do? I do not fuck nobody's cock. Do it, and then get them out of here. I'll take the son of a bitch. I'll take care of it! And for others, it was also "The Devil" ... their worst nightmares. Monica. Kiss my hand. What? I promise not to do it again. Please do not hurt me. Forgive. I will not hurt you. Raul punishes this bitch. No, Ral. Please ... No, please. Do not. Elizabeth was a very good whore. I won a lot of money with it. Had the same contract all others. Worked three years for me, and then they could do on their own. They could do what they wanted. To marry Richard Gere. If not died before. Unfortunately, Isabel ... never became a beautiful rich woman. I told the police everything I know. Absolutely everything. - Everything? - Yes Did you tell the your drug addiction? - That no. - That's what I thought. I met Elizabeth ... when promoted the new movie in New York. Also knew a guy called Michael. He knew how to provide women for fun. Well, I have to go. I'll call you tomorrow. Good evening, ladies. How are you? Cut the shit, Miguel. Did anyone see you come in? You think I'm a beginner? Suit you best. Just select one or all of them. Hello, my name is Julia. Together we can have fun. As always, darling. I'll take it. Just that? Look at Crystal. You'll love it. I like, Michael. But I just want to that. Is there a problem? Here's your money! It's a lot of money. More than usual. I have the intention of have it for the weekend. And I'm a lesbian. Only pussies fucked. We were together two weeks, but wanted to try something new. Do not do drugs, Julia. I will not. Come on, do not ruin the fun. Just this once. Now, your turn. Come on. Do you love me? - Do it! - God. Good girl. Take another line. And that's it. Now the fun begins. estrenosdecine2009.forums-free.com ... How did you get involved with the girlfriend of your client? My client had a lot of brides. But Isabel was different. It was like my daughter. And sometimes daughter the were throwing you, right? Listen, it was not. Do you understand? I tried to help. We became great friends. Let me help you. Hold. Are you okay? Are you awake? Brought you breakfast. Here are coffee, juice, fruit. Come. Calm down, Raul. This motherfucker deceived us. If you had not been drugged, you would have seen when he arrived. If you need me I'll be out, boss. This time I saved him. But I'll kick your ass, fucking piece of shit! Did you know that Isabel was on drugs? Even Stevie Wonder would have seen. Especially cocaine, right? Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, stimulants, tranquilizers. He used what he found. It was this rich guy ... The rich man drove her insane, was like a disease. - I was in love with that bastard. - James? Yes, you should ask James, the son of a bitch. From am slowly remembering everything. Isabel was a woman. What happened? Tell me, Daniel. Why did the chicken cross the road? - Do not know. Why get across? - Hell, no! The chicken crossed the road because had many chickens and too little food! And he had to deal with the rooster by food. Unlike chicken Isabel never crossed the road. Do you know why? Because she was hit by a fucking truck! She was a whore and joined the rest of the slag in the world. Bring things to car, boy! Shit. Hello. Yes, Captain. I had to do some private things. Yes, I'll be at the station in an hour. All right. Sure take your stuff, damn chicken shit. If not dance even one song, the head begin to suspect something. - Tell me about James. - Yes, but first ... a dance. James. Tell me about James. James ... James W. Smith III. The richest man on the East Coast. He inherited nearly a billion when ... his parents died in an accident. Sorry, ladies. Organized parties like crazy ... to get the model or the actor who wanted ... But he prefers to party Professional girls. Strippers, escorts, porn stars. Elizabeth also fell to its charm. But Mr. Forbes also had its dark side. Fell in love with Isabel and began to get jealous. Of his other clients. James one of my best customers until he met Elizabeth. I was crazy about her. I thought fucking a virgin but Isabel was not. Hello. I had no clothes. Where the hell is the clock? He had a watch in his hand when he died. Where the hell is? Bravo. I congratulate you. Looks like you're fast ascending police caddy. - What the hell are you doing here, James? - I want to talk to you. You think I do not know that Isabel killed out of jealousy? What bribed all to shut up? It's possible. I could have killed her. Of course. Wait, Don Quixote. Wait a minute. Yes, it is. Tell me. I remember the police I said there was a witness, he heard two shots ... near one forty-five in the morning. Is it true? Yeah, about that time. Tell me something, How can you have killed ... if I was arrested at 1:35? This is me, stopped by New York police. - What the hell are you, James? - I want to help you solve the case. I owe it to her. Well, James. Tell me, who killed her? I think you know, Daniel. But forget about the emotions and focus on the facts. Come with me. I want to show you something. Police could not solve the crime for two reasons. Firstly not understand how this business. The girls come here willing to give up everything for a dream. Some people call the American dream. I'd rather is the American nightmare. See? Prostitution has changed. You do not stand in Times Square or Sunset Boulevard. No, no, no. The business has changed. Now, everything is based on fantasy. There are those who like teens, youngsters, sadomasochism. What you prefer. And best of all this is ... which is just a click away. Internet has changed everything. You want a date? Browse by Google. It has all the photos, Videos even zodiac sign. So tell me: What about illegal girls with the internet revolution? For them, there is only this place. Perverts, dealers, producers porn and other nasties from around here. What a bitch category belong? Isabel's story was real. His life was good comparing with the girls here. The law does not protect victims. Not in this world governed by anarchy. Survival of the fittest. No son of a bitch took care of Elizabeth! You seem very knowledgeable, but What the fuck you mean, James? Enrique Iglesias I thought you were smarter. Like many of these girls, Isabel, ... never had a choice. The American dream never became a reality for her. It was a wonderful woman. But he was doomed. Drugs, abuse, everything! Nobody killed Elizabeth. The American Nightmare killed her. What the hell do you mean? Who do you want to arrest, James? No! You're not listening! Think a bit about my second point. Legally no one matter who killed her! Thousands of women like Elizabeth die every day, Daniel, ... and nobody cares about them! Let me ask you something. Who benefited with his death? Who had a motive to kill her? Me? What I do not control anything? I'm just a millionaire. No, damn it. I miss her! What about that? Will you do something about it, Mr. Detective? It was so good that customers gave jewels and shit. At first it did not affect me. I felt sorry for her. But then I began to bother, you know? I wanted to talk to her. I tried to remind about why they came here ... About his son, and the money he needed. But it was useless. She was lost. Time's up, buddy. Is that enough for you? We're just talking. - Get off me now! - Just a second. I like you. The head begins to suspect. And remember, here's cameras. Tell me how much you make here. Because I think that's a lot. Well, not so much as you think. The club gets 40% of all income. If you try to cheat, can not return to work. Second, Miguel takes ... 50% everything we receive from our customers. Add to that the money for food, rent, makeup and, in the case of Isabel, drugs. Actually we have no almost no money. This makes a lot less than what everyone thinks. But Isabel was doing well. He had James, I took care of it, and a lesbian actress I was crazy about her. He also had the old it was like a father to her. What else can you expect a whore? You killed Isabel? Did you kill her? He had every reason to kill that bitch ungrateful! Brought her here, and taught him everything. And what do I get? Nothing. No respect or appreciation, nothing! Sure he deserved the shit that happened! - Damn bitch, you killed Isabel? - No, you idiot! What's between you and Isabel? - Are you a fucking cop? - Yes, I am. Outside, friend! Not abusing the girls. I decide when I'm the son of a bitch! Elizabeth wanted to quit. What happened? Basically wanted leave his job. I tried to help her find legal work. But ... I was addicted. Drugs kill her slowly. So I decided to take her with me, for a couple of days at the mountain. I wanted clean of drugs. Isabel, spent two week with me in the cabin. How did you do? What do you tell your wife? My wife and I were separated by a while. Isabel helped me overcome this difficult time. I did not kill Elizabeth. Our friendship did not end well but I did not. When was the last time you saw Isabel? The day he died. We had a great discussion. He said he left the profession ... and bring your child here. And I said ... What did he say? Julia! What else did he say, Julia? Pregnant. She told me she was pregnant. Julia. Did you know that Elizabeth was pregnant? Where did you hear? It was not in the police report. - But you know that? - Yes When you find out you were pregnant? Mr. Watson, a certain Elizabeth says he has an appointment with you. - I call the police? - No, just go. Isabel. I thought we'd talk later to decide what to do. The next day the police came and I was interrogated about his death. What about pregnancy? A friend of mine was in charge of that the matter is not known. - I wonder one thing, son ... - I'm not your fucking son. Why are you so interested in Isabel? Why do you care? Police closed the case 15 years ago. I reopened the investigation. All right. You know that none of this come to court? Not even be a trial. When was the last time you saw Isabel? The day he died. - Was murdered. - Yes - Did you kill her? - Fuck ... and listen to the story to the end! Think you can give up just like that? You signed a contract with me for three fucking years! Three fucking years! You still lack a fucking year. If you try to leave me, you I will find you and shit! And then look for your father, your sister and your son. I will kill your whole family and all your DNA. Do you understand? All your DNA. What? You understand that is DNA? What? Say it, bitch! Do you understand? Say you understand, bitch! Say it. Say you understand, bitch! Say you understand, bitch! Go out and earn money for me, fucking bitch! Anna, give me my stuff. Give me my bag. I hope you die, bitch! Elizabeth, it's time to go. You made a scene and that's bad for business. - James! - Raul, okay. Get a grip. One false move and you have to vrtela me. Looks like the party started without me. You look terrible. Do not talk to me, you fucking bitch! I see you were trying to steal my man. Stop fighting, girls. Do not argue. Calm down. There enough for all. Now you'll see. Move your ass, girl! Move it! What the hell are you doing? You are kissing my girl! Do not get mad. Your little whore wants me now. - Come here, come here! - What the hell are you doing, James? Son of a bitch! Get away from me! Call the police. Is this what you want? Come on, you piece of shit! I'll kill you, motherfucker! Come on! Raul! Pair it out. Did you get everything you wanted? Yes. If you find who killed Isabel ... let me know, please. Hello, handsome. Did you have a hard day? Yes, you could say that. Do not you want your friend Crystal, help you forget? I can help anything. Come on, do not be a spoilsport. - What do you, Crystal? - You can buy me a drink. - Today I am good company. - Never are. I like you, and if I remember correctly, still have unfinished business. Come on. Shit! What the ...? And for your information ... Isabel was a whore! Isabel ... was my mother. Watch Fucking shit! The damn clock was missing!
