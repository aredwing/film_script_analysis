What happened at the pep raIIy earIier was unacceptabIe. And I think you know that. I wasn't gonna stand back and watch Taz disrespect us. But what you did was disrespectfuI to me and to the frat. Look, Chance, you're a Theta now, and we expect a Iot more from you. BeIieve me, nobody wants to outdo Taz more than I do. You Iet me handIe him. Understand? My man. -Fellas, keep form. -All right.

We couId stiII incorporate the same moves from our Iast routine... ...but it doesn't hurt to have a ace up our sIeeves. For those of you who wanna incorporate Chance's choreography... ...into the routine, raise your hands. Looks Iike you guys better get started. -Yeah, thank you. AII right. -Oh, yeah. You gonna put our fate in the hands of a neo? I'II be damned if I Iet Taz win this. Maybe he can give us the edge that we need. That's aII I'm saying. I hope you're right. Yes, yes, yes. Show me what you got there, man. That's it. I didn't caII a break. You got a routine, you better show it. -AII right. -So Iet's go, Iet's go. -Morning, Terry. -Hey, Shorty. -Chance in yet? -Course not. One more time. Wynn, stay with me. Remember that right Ieg.

Chance, my office, now. Sit down. Look... ...you didn't re-enroII in Truth just to sIack off. SIack off? I'm here every day trying to heIp you out. I'm entering the show so I can win schoIarship money. That frat is not a priority. Look... ...when your mom died... ...you ran out of here with no money and no pIan. You Ieft me to handIe this restaurant. Now that you're back home, I wanna see you take some responsibiIity... ...to see this thing through. I'm not trying to run your Iife. I've aIways tried to be supportive of you. Now I need you to be supportive of me. -Pi. -Delta. Pi Delta Mu step. I gotta admit, man, your girI is getting it in right now, Chance. She Iooking kind of fIy too. AII these fIy honeys here, and you gotta check out my girI. What's the matter, man? You worried about aII this big Wynn? Don't do that. And I'm good.

Pi Delta Mu step. Pi Delta Mu step. Aren't you happy to see me? Slow it down. Come on. -Get it, girIs. -She's cuter than Iast year. -Is it serious? -What do you want, Brenda? I don't know. You're just kind of on my mind. I never got a chance to expIain myseIf. Hey, hey, hey. It's been a year. Why now? Because it's not the same without you. I kind of miss you and me. You know... ...me and you did have some good times. Wasn't aII easy saiIing. You see, when I needed you the most... ...you wasn't even there. Too busy hooking up with Taz to notice. I deserve that. I do. But when your mom died, you shut me out. And then you transferred schooIs in FIorida. What was I supposed to do? You know, you're a reaI piece of work. Everybody makes mistakes, Chance. Same number, right? -Hey, babe. -Hey. -Did you see us? -You guys did good. -Yeah? -Yeah. -How good? -ReaI good. -Proud? -ReaI proud. Let's go, baby. Okay. CouId you just drop me at the stadium?

I must say, man, the way you got at Dane this morning... ...that was kind of gangster, man. Now you're just gonna have to foIIow through. -What's that supposed to mean? -You got Dane to change the routine. That's big. Just think about it. If we win on Sunday, oh, we be Iiving Iegends, man. WeII, weII... ...if it isn't the Thetas' new mascot and his sidekick, OId YeIIer. I know you ain't taIking with aII that possum around your neck. You know what? Your jokes couId use an upgrade. They're getting kind of oId. Yeah, kind of Iike them dance steps you do. You spit a good game at the raIIy, but I hope you can back that up. Last night was just a taste of what I'm bringing. When it's aII said and done... ...we'II see who waIks away with the trophy and the money. Me. Trophy on one arm and your girI on the next.

I'm not thinking about that girI. I want nothing to do with her. I saw the texts, Chance. You're saying you went through my phone? -You Iied to me. -I didn't Iie to you. Brenda pushed up on me. And I toId her-- ToId her what, Chance? You toId her no? Or maybe? Know what? -Maybe I'm not good enough for you. -Don't-- No, no, no. Because ever since day one, you never trusted me. Don't you dare. Don't you dare turn this around on me, because this is about you. Your inabiIity to make a decision about what you want. You're the new hot thing on campus and everybody wants a piece, right? WeII, I refuse to pIay second fiddIe to any girI. I'm sorry. Look, I don't know what eIse to say. -HeIIo? -You busy? No. Why?

You have any idea who they were? How the heII wouId I know? I wasn't here. ReaIIy? Because they came asking for you by name. Why the heII wouId somebody wanna come after you? Man, I don't know. But it couId've been anybody. -ProbabIy one of Taz's boys. -These cats were straight hood. -Straight up. -Yeah. Yeah, he Iied about it, but I kind of think you overreacted a IittIe bit. You know Brenda. I honestIy think she's just chasing after him. -WeII, he's not running. -That don't mean he did anything. Come on. You seen her at that party the other night. She was jocking him kind of hard. And I'm Ietting you know now... ...it ain't the first time and won't be the Iast. Why'd he Iie if he wasn't doing anything wrong? Because he's a man, sweet cakes. That's just what men do. AII right, Iook. Give it some time... ...see how the weekend goes, and he'II come around. I trust you. Cheers. Yo, Rock Star. -AII right? -Yeah, fine. You shouId see him, though, you know? What's up? Have to teII you something. CoupIe of weeks ago, I got hustIed at a dance battIe. Now they're gunning for me. Are you trying to teII me that this... ...is because of you? So why didn't you say anything? I don't know. I guess-- I guess I was scared to get kicked off the team. I reaIIy, reaIIy needed to win this competition. Are you serious? That's what you're worried about? I mean, you've aIways been kind of seIfish, but this is ridicuIous. Something about you changed. My whoIe Iife has changed. Ever since my mom died, I-- Don't put this on your mother. Don't. Everything has aIways been about Chance Harris. And it's been that way since we were IittIe. I'm your boy, Chance. You shouId've come to me. -Hey. -Hey, girI. So I heard there was, Iike, a huge fight at the Theta house Iast night. The IittIe dude you was dancing with at the cIub Iast night, where he at? Do I know you? I reaIIy thought you coIIege boys was a IittIe bit smarter than that. -Answer the damn question. -What you want with him? -Anybody hurt? -Wynn got himseIf beat up. It reaIIy ain't none of your business. But Iet's just say he owe me. -What about Chance? -I don't know. You Iike catfish? What are you doing here? I thought you shouId be home resting up. And miss my first game as a Theta? Come on, man. I thought it'd be nice if my best homey wouId roII with me. PIus it's hard for a handicapped brother. I couIdn't get one honey. Just one honey to just heIp your boy out, I swear. -StiII ain't got that boy Iaid yet? -Oh, reaIIy, Shorty? ReaIIy? That's what we're doing? It's not that simpIe. Don't ruin your homecoming weekend pining over some guy. -It screams desperation. -You're the one that has me worried. You toId me something happened to him. Don't worry about Chance. He's fine. -Excuse me? -He's fine. It's a good thing he wasn't at the house when the fight went down. -And how do you know that? -Because he was with me. Why you Iet that girI get to you? She get her Iife making peopIe miserabIe. -She's doing a good job. -That's not the point. Damn, man, you came kind of deep this year. Ladies. Man, Iook, can you pIease hoId up, man? I couId use some heIp. This is not cooI. Hey. Nikki, baby. -I wanna taIk to you. -No. Don't ''baby'' me. CongratuIations, you finaIIy made a choice. Nikki. Nikki!
