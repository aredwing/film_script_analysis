Don't bag on my Wheels. - She just needs a newtranny. - She needs more than that. - Shut up. - You shut up. It's a piece of junk. - You're gonna hurt her feelings. - I don't care. - Wait for the cars, Daniel. - I'm Waiting for the cars. Jeff: Flood her. Good. Danny: I flood her like a champion.

Howmany did you say Were left on this? - Near 70 kinds. - Okay. ( shop bell rings ) - Surf must have been good. - Sorry. I'm picking up my granddaughter at the airport tomorrow. You Wanna come? You mean if there's no surf? Sure. I haven't seen her in years. I don't remember What it's like to be 17. Me, neither. Sorry I Was late. Mm-hmm. Hey, you Wanna cover for me tomorrow? Why? Picking up Sue's granddaughter at the airport. Sue has a granddaughter? - Yep. - Weird. Girl: I know. Oh, my God. You've grown up. - You look just like-- - My father? Yeah. Your father. Nice suitcase. It's my mother's. Nicole, this is Kayla. She manages my surf shop. Hey, Nic. Welcome to Santa Cruz. Thanks. Well, let's get you home and settled in. Sue: Come on. You guys have fun, okay? Do you remember this place? This is Where my father grewup. ( knocks on door ) Do you mind if I come in? No. Your mom said you Were a champion swimmer and obviously quite a reader, too. Look what I found. You and your dad rode this Wave all the Way in together. Do you remember that? I don't remember doing that. Well, you Were just a natural. He Was so proud of you. Your mother Was, too. She said there's a pool at the university. Uh-huh. But you got the Whole Pacific Ocean out there. I need a pool. For swim practice. Of course you do. ( machine Whirring ) ( knocks ) ( machine powers down ) Howwas it? Overhead. Packed. Summer's here. Did you know Sue had a granddaughter? Yeah, Ricky's kid. Who's Ricky? He Was my best friend. We Were real close, like you and Danny. You guys gonna take that trip or What? Danny's car needs a newtransmission. I wish I could help you guys out. Why don't you take some of that money you've been saving, buy yourself a car that runs? Little graduation present for yourself. It's not for that. That Watch your mom gave you. That's Worth something. You can sell it. That was her dad's watch. So? Go find some uncrowded Waves, man. You only live once. I'd go surfing. I knowyou Would, Dad. I don't knowyou. What do you Wanna know? How come you never got married? The short answer for now, bad timing. Anything else you Wanna know? I don't knowWhat to call you. You can call me Sue. ( knocks ) Can l-- If you leave this door open and that Window, you're gonna get a great ocean breeze. I prefer the privacy. What Would you like to do tomorrow? I have swim practice in the morning, and then I have to read. You know, Nicole, summer Will be over before you knowit. Sometimes you just have to dive in or life passes you by. Is that what happened to you? Maybe. - Good night. - Good night. ( girl laughs ) ( girl screams ) ( screaming ) ( groans ) ( dog barking ) ( stammers ) Sorry. I sawa light. That's okay. I had almost forgotten about all this. Somebody could live in here. The Whole summer long. You Wanna see something? My old bikini. ( laughs ) Latest style at the time. So Who does this belong to? - Jimmy. - Who's Jimmy? Jimmy Was your grandfather. - He Was a surfer? - Yeah. So What happened to him? He Was drafted and sent away to fight in the War in Vietnam. "Beautiful Wave"? Sue: His favorite place. Where is it? I don't know. It might have been more of a state of mind than an actual place. Jimmy used to say that he thought the universe Was made of Waves. Waves connect everything. He just thought that the Whole thing Was one beautiful Wave. You know, Jimmy never knew that he had a son. You never told him? I didn't knowthat I was pregnant when he left. And I didn't Want him to Worry about me. I just Wanted him to come home in one piece. His letters stopped coming, and then my letters started coming back. I never had a chance to tell him. Jimmy gave me this before he left. I Want you to take it. It's a sea turtle. I think I'm gonna sell it. I promised your father that it Would be his one day, but I couldn't let go of it. Hello? Hello? Kayla: Hey, What's up? Sorry, the door Was open. Yeah, it's always open. Sue Wanted me to bring these to you. Great. You've been a lot of places. I left home when I was 13. Yeah, it Was a bad scene. You know, if it Wasn't for Sue, I wouldn't be here. She never told me anything about this. ( blows ) My grandfather used to live in here. It's so cool. - Kayla: Whoa! - What? It's an old surf map of Baja. Look, it goes all the Way down to the tip. Past Cabo. Check it out. "Ola Linda." Ola Linda? Beautiful Wave. Beautiful Wave? But Sue said that Wasn't a real place. Well, it's on the map. It must be. I Want to go there. First of all, it's in another country. I mean, it's 1,700 miles away from here. And second of all and most importantly, Sue Would never let you go. - Nicole: What if We Went together? - I Wish. Ooh! The early '60s, ancient. Sue: Hey, I'm not that old. Check out the old surf posters and the classic log-- - Dude, it's an Olson. - Yep. What's an Olson? The '60s, dude. Early Santa Cruz shaper. The '60s, dude. Greg Noll, Miki Dora, the '60s, dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah, really cool old stuff, brah. - So What do you think? - Newhead gasket, fluid, lube, plugs, tires. I can do it for you, for a price. How about enough to cover a new tranny? Done. Sue: You guys Wanna stay for dinner? - Thanks. - But no thanks. 'Cause We're gonna hit the lane before it gets dark. Yeah, but thanks. Sue: Okay. So Why didn't you ever look for Jimmy? I tried to find out When and Where he landed, but the Army Wouldn't tell me because we weren't married. So Kayla and I Wanna take a surf trip to Malibu. Really? Just the two of you? Hmm. I stood here for hours... after he drowned. Her mother told me that she hasn't been in the ocean since it happened. Dude, hand me the grease gun. Oh, my God. It's beautiful. How much you Want for it? You Want it? I don't know. How much do you think it's Worth? Actually, it's not for sale. Nic wants it. Don't you, Nic? Is that true, Nicole? Um... - Yeah. - Sue: Well, that's a surprise. I had no idea you'd Want it. It's hers now. She can do Whatever she Wants With it. I'll see you back at the surf shop. Kayla, it's just gonna sit here. Actually, it's not. Nic and I are gonna go on a little surf trip of our own. Find some good Waves and some cute guys, but if you're nice, maybe We'll consider a deal When We get back. - Where should I put these? - No, you don't. I have to read 'em all by the end of summer. One. Just one. More food? - Please. - Okay. ( laughs ) Kayla: Check out the surf. Ha ha! Cannot Wait to get you in the Water. Okay, put this on. I'll help you get your board in the Water. I don't really feel like it. Come on, let's get in the Water. Okay, I'm gonna let you slide this time. ( sighs ) ( gasps ) Kayla: Finish your book? It's not the kind you finish. It's philosophy. Makes you think. You know, I think you should think twice about Wearing that bathing suit again. I mean, unless it's for a swim meet. I'm kidding. I think it's really cool you got in the Water today. Even if it Was only up to your ankles. ( laughing ) Let's put her down here. ( speaking Spanish ) Okay, it's good. Okay. Let's let it go. ( speaking Spanish ) I knew she Was going to those islands. Bueno. S. - Caf? - S, con azcar. Okay. Danny: Let me show you how to drive this car. - Jeff: Okay. - It goes quickly. ( car sputtering ) She's a beast.

We know we're only here 'cause you guys let us come along. Danny: Yeah, thanks. You're welcome. I think we should check out one last spot before we head back. Sorry, dude, this trip is over. It's the last spot on Jimmy's map. Nic should at least see it. Kayla: What's it called? "Ola Linda, 40 miles east." Kayla: "Ola" means Wave. "Linda" means beautiful. Beautiful Wave. ( sighs ) It Was Jimmy's favorite place. That map is 50 years old, Nic. So don't be surprised if they built a resort there. Who are these guys? Look like gangbangers. Kayla: Slowdown, Jeff. They're nejos. - Nicole: what are nejos? - Poachers. They're really dangerous. My magic eight ball says that Ola Linda is right around the corner.

I'm sorry I asked you guys to come here. We all wanted to come. ( girl laughing ) ( screaming ) We made it. ( beeping ) ( speaking Spanish ) An Olsen? Yeah. Is that your van right there? It belonged to my grandfather. My grandmother gave it to me. Sue. Who's that? Jeff: Jimmy. Come on, you guys. Kayla: Let's give 'em some space. I can't believe she kept this after all these years. She kept all your letters, too. And she wore this. You know... I'm not the same person your grandmother fell in love With. We were very young When we met. She wouldn't recognize me. I recognized you. You look just like my dad. Where is your dad? He died. He drowned... saving me. Jimmy: I'm sorry. It's my dad's favorite book. You can have it. I'm finished. I gave this book to Sue the day I left for Vietnam. ( laughs ) ? Let's take a break from the world for a while ? ? Gonna pack our bags ? ? Gonna count down the miles ? ?
