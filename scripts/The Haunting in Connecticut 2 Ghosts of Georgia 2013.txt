I dreamed about a swing. Is there one at the new house? Well, if there isn't, I bet your daddy might just put one up for you. (chuckles) Come on, let's go get some breakfast, okay? - I'll meet you in there. - Okay. (sighs) Girl: What does our new house look like? Lisa: It's way out in the country And there's just lots of room for you to play. Girl: Can we bring my bike? Girl: Even though I don't know how to ride it yet. Lisa: You are gonna have lots of places To learn how to ride your bike. - Hey. Howdy. - Daddy! (laughs) Oh! Mmm! - You done good, daddy. - Why, thank you. What about you, huh? What do you think? - Who lived there before? - Nobody, honey. That's why the bank gave us such a good deal, right? - Thank you, mama. - Mwah! Well, maybe you'd rather live in there. - No. - That can be arranged. - No, thank you. - You'd have the whole place to yourself. - Nope. - Teddy bear could have his own room. Come on, let's go. I'll race ya. Come on. Go, go, go. Race mama. (static crackling) Oh, what the hell, baby? You can't find a clearer station than that? We're out in the boondocks, babe. We're lucky we get running water. Thank you. Well, we don't need water. That's what beer is for. - Mm-hmm. - This is my beer, by the way. - Mm-mmm. - (rattling) (scratching) - (squeaks) - (shrieks) (lisa laughing) Shoo! Git! God! Shoo! Shoo! Git! You think that's funny, do you? (door creaks) (rattling) (car horn honking) Aunt joyce! - (honking horn) - (radio blaring, stops) - Aunt joyce! - (screams) Kid, you grow like a weed. Hi. Look at you, miss homeowner. (laughing) That didn't take long. No suitcase? I am not a freeloader, andy. - Today or historically? - Stop it, andy. Joyce is just here to wish us well. Is that so? It's a goddamn curse being right all the time. It truly is. Joyce: It didn't work out with ray. Was he the married one or the drunk? Bit of both, it turns out. - (chuckles) - Lisa: What about you? - Are you? - 11 weeks sober. - (voices whispering) heidi. - Andy: Shit, call guinness. - Help us. Help us. - Andy: On second thought, That's probably a bad idea. - Joyce: I can get by. - Voices: Heidi. Heidi... Joyce: I've got alimony coming in. I want to be near family. Well, find a place near here. Just not here. Who lives over there? That's just some old wreck someone left behind. - I'm gonna haul it away. - A girl lives down there. Hmm? Nobody lives around here, baby. - When'd you see a girl? - Just now. You know, I've lived in worse. "Near here, but not here," right? You did say that, babe. - (andy groans) - (lisa laughs) (sighs) (sobbing, whimpering) (sobbing continues) (rustling, sobbing) (moaning) (moaning resumes) (screams) Stop it. - Heidi: Mama? - (sobbing) Why are you crying? It's nothing, sweetie. It's nothing. Aunt joyce is out front, so go say good night. And I'll come tuck you in, okay? Okay. Heidi: Mama's crying. Do you know why she gets sad? Your mama... Gets feelings sometimes. Feelings she doesn't much care for. What kind of feelings? Tell you what. I want you to try something for me. Can you do that? Look out there. At what? Don't really focus on anything specific. Just take it all in. (woman's voice humming) (children laughing) Feel anything? Woman: Help us. - I think so. - Help us. And sometimes... I see things. (sighs) That's 'cause you were born with a veil, sweetie, Just like your mama and me and our mama. What's a veil? It means that when you were born You had a sheen over your face like a wedding veil. And sometimes folks born that way have a gift. They can... They can sense certain things that other people can't. Mama never said anything about it. Your mama doesn't like this kind of talk Of gifts and feelings. So let's just keep this conversation between us, okay? Now run to bed, please. (laughs) Love you. I love you, too. (birds chirping) (buzzing) (water dripping) (pipes rattling) (voices whispering) Lisa... I know, mama. Listen to me, lisa. I have something to tell you. Listen to me, lisa. I have something to tell you. Just be a good girl... (voices moaning) And listen to your mother. Listen to me! (gasps) - Andy: Lisa. - (gasps) It's 6:00 a. M. How long you been in here this time, hmm? You saw something again, didn't you? Here. If these pills ain't working, We sure as hell shouldn't keep paying for them. They're working. It just gets a little tricky when they wear off, is all. You should finish getting dressed. You'll be late for work. - All right, darling. - Take care. Careful, heidi. - You need any help? - I can do it. Okay. All right. (grunts) (groans) (whimpering) Voices: Heidi. (yelps) (radio playing) # Little girls, they love to dream # # close their eyes and try to see... # (turns engine off) Hey, neighbor. Heidi's been gone an hour and I don't know where she is. Well, she's probably just wandering. - Heidi is not a wanderer. - That's 'cause she's never had anywhere to wander to. Now she does. You're just gonna have to get used to it. Heidi. Baby. Where have you been? I've been worried sick. I'm not supposed to say. Who said that? Damn it, heidi, who told you that? Mr. Gordy. - Who's mr. Gordy? - An old man I met. He said there's a swing set in the woods just like in my dream. Remember, mama? Okay. Okay. Come here. Joyce, get andy on the phone. This is it. Mr. Gordy told me there's a swing here. Well, babe, I don't see a swing. I'll be damned. There may not be a swing here now, But there used to be. (grunts) - (gasps) - (laughs) - (groans) jesus. - Walk much? Babe, did this mr. Gordy say anything else to you? He said there's money buried in the garden. Okay, sweetie, I want you to do something for me. How much money? If this mr. Gordy ever comes up to you again, I want you to scream as loud as you can. Do you understand me? Okay. Let's go. (water running) (lights crackle) (wind whistles) - (gasps) - (static plays on radio) (static stops) (pills rattle) - (wind whistles) - (door creaks) (footsteps rumbling) (door creaks) Andy? (metal rattling) (heidi giggles) (woman sobbing) Heidi: I'm not supposed to talk to you. They think you're a bad man. You're not, are you? Heidi. Was that mr. Gordy you were talking to? Lisa: Heidi, why didn't you tell us That you had an imaginary friend? Heidi: Mr. Gordy is not imaginary. He talks to me. Lisa: I was standing right there watching. - There's nobody outside. - Mr. Gordy's real. Heidi, stop it. I don't want to hear Any more talk about this mr. Gordy. Do you understand? Seeing things that aren't there, It's just not a road that you want to go down. Good night, okay? (joyce, andy laugh) You are just saying that. What the hell, joyce? You've been here a week And heidi's already seeing invisible friends? Turns out this mr. Gordy, he's up here. And you, encouraging her. Coming out here, digging up my garden, going on some wild-goose... (coins clinking) Lisa's mother: Don't be afraid. - Let them in. - Man: Let them in. (heartbeat thumping) (gasps) (music playing) (engine off) Good lord, woman. What'd you do, rob a shopping mall? Courtesy of my new sugar daddy mr. Gordy. Did you tell heidi where the money came from? No, and neither will you. I'm sure there's lots of stuff buried in these parts. It doesn't mean that there's a mr. Gordy. I beg to differ. Did you look at the deed to your house? - The previous owner? - Yeah, the bank owned it. Before that. Check it out. Straight from the county assessor. Look at the name on the bottom. The gordy family owned all this land Going back 200 years. And this js gordy was the last one. Then the bank got it in the '70s. Ask me how they got it. Okay, you're gonna get one shot at this, all right? If this doesn't go the way I think it's gonna go, I'll never bring it up again. Deal. Heidi, come out here a second. (door opens) I am looking for a husband for you. They're all old. You marry 'em. Good girl. Okay, pick a winner for me, But look at them all carefully first. Can you do that? You see something, honey? You know that man? (whispers) That's mr. Gordy. Joyce: Okay. I told you he was real. I told you and you didn't believe me. (door slams) Damn it! My daughter is not conversing with the dead. She picked mr. Gordy's face out of 50 pictures. Explain that. That's just your influence coming out in her. You know what? I don't want you talking about any of this with heidi anymore. You hear me? She's my daughter. She can talk about it with me. Why would she? You don't listen. You just tell her what's what just like you did with me. You needed it. You know what? You still do. I suppose I'd be better off numbing myself with pills? - Stop it. - You don't think I know? That was mama's trick, too. And that worked out beautifully for her. Joyce, go home. There is nothing wrong with heidi. You know what it is, lisa. It's starting for her. (wind whistling) - (door creaks) - Lisa: Honey? Are you awake? (door opens, closes) (birds chirping) Man: When I hear of a family moving to town, I visit to see if they found the church yet. Because I happen to preside over one. Oh. Folks around here have been wondering When this rather special piece of property would sell. Yeah? What's special about it? Aside from it being overgrown as all hell. - Andy wyrick. - Pastor jordan wells. The property is special Because back around the time of the civil war, It was the stationmaster's land. But I'm sure you knew that. What, like a railroad? No tracks on this land. No, it wasn't that kind of railroad. Do you mean, like, the underground railroad? Folks who helped escaped slaves make it up north? That's right. Those people were known as "stationmasters. " And one of the most well-known lived right here on your land. He actually hid slaves on our property? Yes, ma'am. Hundreds of men, women, and children Passed right through here with nothing but the clothes on their back And the light of the moon to guide them. - They didn't have flashlights? - Oh, no, sweetie. They couldn't even use lanterns. The moonlight was the only light that they ever saw. It was the light of freedom And the promised land. The stationmaster was an extraordinary man. Entire generations of families would not exist If it was not for the stationmaster And this piece of land. So, don't be surprised If you get visitors from time to time. - Living ones, I hope. - As opposed to? Andy's just having a little fun. - I do that. - Well, if you do get any visitors, I hope you'll be more welcoming Than the previous owner js gordy was. He didn't exactly share his ancestor's... Hospitable nature. Between you and me, There was something seriously off about that man. Mr. Gordy's nice to me. Uh, look, pastor... Sweetie... We'd better get our day started. - (wind whistling) - (chimes ringing) (woman sobbing) (people singing) (clicking, faint snarling) (woman sobbing) Hello? (footsteps tapping) (voices whispering) (wind whistling) Voices: Help us. Help us. Help us. Help us. Help us. (birds chirping) (sighs) (squeaking) (rustling) (squeaking) (chains rattling) (gasps) Mr. Gordy. What is that? Tell me what it is. - Heidi. - Mr. Gordy. Heidi! You know what? I think there is an invisible man around here. It's me. (both laughing) - Did you miss your daddy? - Yeah. Yeah? Right answer. - Got a little surprise for you. - What is it? You'll find out. Come on. - (gasps) - (dog barks) Look what I found in the back of your daddy's truck. - (squeals) - Heidi, meet chief. Oh, my god! Daddy, I love him! Am I the greatest father in the world or what? - You'll do. - Thank you. Oh, I love you. - (heidi squeals) - (laughing) (rustling) (crashing) (barking) - (howling) - (chief whines) Remember to bring chief's bowl back in the house after he's done. Where's chief? For god's sake. - Chief! - Chief! Chief! Damn dog. (barking, whining) Come on. It's gonna be all right. (barks) Andy: Chief! (whistles) (whining) Chief sounds hurt. Hey, heidi, why don't you just sit down right here for a second? Okay? And don't move. Be right back. - (dog howling) - Andy: Chief! (whistles) Hey. Come here, boy. - Chief. - (whining) Chief. How'd you get in there, boy? (dog howling) Daddy. (dog howling) Woman's voice: Heidi. - (pounding) - (barks) All right, watch out, boy. (barking) What the hell? Daddy? (voices whispering) (echoes) Help us... Help us. Andy: Heidi. Heidi! (squeaking) (squeaking, male voice humming) (gasps) Man's voice: Help us. (screams) - (screams) - No. Damn it. Hey. I thought I told you to sit tight. - (sobbing) - What are you hollering about over here? Come on. Let's get you home. Hey, babe. Figure out what this thing is yet? Yeah. It's a trap. You see, you bait that chamber there. The animals, they get in and they can't get back out. They get weak and starve. Easy pickings. Hmm. Then you get 'em back out through here. A back door. There's got to be a better way to hunt. - That's just cruel. - No, it's smart. If you're a taxidermist. I already found three more of them in the woods. Figure they made good money for someone back in... Well, whenever the hell they still used locks like these. Well, smash 'em all up so chief doesn't get stuck in them again. Or heidi, for that matter. (thunder rumbling) I love you, lisa. Don't be afraid. Let them in. - Let them in. - (gasps) (thunder crashing) (faint squeaking) (gasps) Oh. Hey. What's going on, huh? Oh, god. (grunts) I have a bike. Do you? Oh, it's pretty. It's purpley. (giggles) What do you mean? Really? People are coming? What kind of people? Who are you talking to now? Mr. Gordy. That right? Ask him where there's more money. I can't. He's gone. Next time, then. He said there's people coming. Who? (rustling) I swear, heidi, we should take you and mr. Gordy on the road. Who's there? Stay behind me. I got an ax. Hello? What the hell is this place? (gasps) - Do you see her, too? - Yeah. Mama kay? - Whoa, whoa. - (heidi gasps) It's okay. My name is prentiss. This is my grandmother mama kay. - This your property? - That you're trespassing on? Yes. We were told we could come back here. Bullshit. By who? Woman in the trailer. Said she's your sister. Sold us this. Sister-in-law. What is that? Shoofly. Prentiss? Now help me sit on down. I want to visit with the little one. Come on, little one. It'll be all right, young man. Andy: All right, you gonna tell me why you came all the way Out here just to buy some ratty old quilt? Prentiss: Long time ago, when this quilt was hung out here in these woods, It meant it was safe to approach. Safe for who? Mama kay's ancestors, for one. Mine, too. Do you even know where you're living at, mister? Andy. Our pastor said we might get visitors. Something about the underground railroad. This was one of the stations. Mama kay's always wanted to visit this place. Guy saved a lot of lives, I reckon. And he deserved better than what happened to him. You don't need eyes to see, little one. But you already know that. What do you mean? You asked your father if he saw me. That makes you some kind of special. My mama says I'm not supposed to talk about that. But you have to be careful With a gift like that. 'Cause sometimes The devil looks a gentleman. Andy: You're telling me... All that took place on my property? Yes, sir. Right here. Guess your pastor left that part out. Yeah. (laughing) Family meeting. Whoa, whoa. Not you, kiddo. You stay outside for a minute, all right? Okay, daddy. Sit down, joyce. Heidi: That man told daddy what happened here, didn't he? Why can't I know? Lisa: It's just not a story for little girls, sweetie. I'm a big girl. You always say that. You remember pastor wells talking about the stationmaster? (bell ringing) Well, back when he owned all this land, He was what's called a taxidermist. He also did something that he didn't tell anybody. He would help hide people That were in trouble. People like mama kay's great aunt nell And her fianc levi. Prentiss: See, nell and levi had fallen in love And had dreams of getting married once they were safe and free. How the hell did people even find their way out here? There were guides called conductors Who helped them. And these quilts, They were a code from the stationmaster telling them where'd he meet them. - Look here. You see this tree? - Yeah. There it is down there. The meeting place. The stationmaster would come get them And take them to a hiding place, Somewhere on this property, Until it was safe to move on. Well, some of the other landowners, They found out what the stationmaster had been doing And, well, they didn't like it very much. So they did some very unkind things to him. (groaning) They hurt him just for helping people? Well, they didn't see it that way, sweetie. What happened to nell? She make it up north? Nell and levi never arrived. No one knows what happened to them. Heidi: I told you something bad happened here. Lisa: No, it was a long time ago. All of that evil is over and done with now. It's still here, mama. I can feel it. It's in the woods. It's coming for me. No, it's not. Heidi, it's all in your head. - It's not real. - But mr. Gordy said... There is no mr. Gordy. Heidi, listen to me. You have to fight this. You have to put it out of your head or... I'll be like you? Dry off. If you loved me, you'd believe me. It's because I love you that I can't, baby. I don't hear you getting out of that tub. Heidi wyrick, don't make me come back in there. Heidi, what is taking so long? Heidi? (voices whispering) Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, god! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Come on, baby. Cough it up. (coughing) Honey! (screaming) Lisa. Heidi. Andy. What happened? She was convulsing and unconscious. And vomiting sawdust and insects? - Andy. - Are you on any medication, mrs. Wyrick? You didn't see what I saw. I saw her. - You weren't there. - Heidi. Do you remember any of this? Yeah, baby. I didn't dry off like I was supposed to. And mama pulled me out of the tub real hard. I'm sorry, that's not what happened. They've been through enough for tonight. Come on. Just tell me exactly what we're supposed to do here. If you want my advice, I suggest you consult with a psychiatrist. Or a priest. Thanks. - Andy. - Let's let heidi rest up a sec. It's hard when people don't believe you, Isn't it? Really, lisa? We're possessed by the devil now? Good lord, people. It's a blessing, not an exorcism. Please. Hi. Pastor: Lord, we pray this night For the soul of an innocent child, And the banishment of evil from this land. I want you to pray with me now. Can you do that? In the name of the father, I ask for the cleansing of fear and sickness From the mind and the soul of this child. I ask that you fill heidi With the warmth of your love into her heart. And that you call upon your angels to watch over her And protect her from danger. Mom and dad, would you lean down and lay her back for me, please? In the name of the son, We call upon your righteous hand, Rid this place of all evil - That may dwell here. - (thunder crashes) (wind whistling) (voices whispering) Help us. (voices whispering) Wells: I ask that you bless this child In the name of the holy ghost. She and the souls of the lost, The forsaken and forgotten. And let your cleansing light shine down upon this place And upon this little girl now and forever. - Amen. - (screams) Amen. (panting) Amen. Amen. May god's love fill your heart, child, And give you peace all of your days. Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? You did great. (static buzzes) (faint music playing) (music continues) (thumping) (wood creaks) (thumps) (faint ping) Mama? (faint ping) (pinging continues) (door creaks) (pings) (pings) (pings) Pastor sent you away. (pings) (thunder rumbles) (thunder crashing) Andy: Lisa! (voices shouting) (bell rings) - (girl screams) - (gasps) (gasping) (screaming) - Andy: Lisa? - (gasps) - Andy? - Heidi's gone. - What? - Call the cops. Oh, my... - (keys beeping) - (whimpering) Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi: Daddy! Help me! Heidi! Daddy! (sirens wailing) - Any sign of her yet? - No. Andy: Heidi! Heidi. Heidi: Daddy! - Heidi! - Help me! - Where are you, baby? - Down in the hole. (heidi sobbing) What hole? Heidi: Down here! Daddy! Oh, my god. Oh, heidi. I can't get out, daddy. I can't get out. Sit tight, heidi. I got to find a way to get down there, baby. No. (voice growling) Heidi. - (wood creaking) - Heidi. Please! (sobbing) Please! Shit! Please don't leave me down here with them, daddy. With who, heidi? (door squeaking) (growling) Andy: Heidi! (growling) Mr. Gordy, is that you? (metal scrapes) Daddy, help me! I'm coming. Daddy! Heidi! Daddy! (heidi shuddering) Daddy. (voice growling) Heidi. Heidi. (sobbing) I'm gonna die. (growling) Help me! (footsteps rustle) Andy: Heidi! - Daddy, hurry. - Heidi, heads up. Coming down. Daddy, hurry! - Help! - Watch out. Daddy! I'm coming, baby. Heidi. (coughing) Heidi. (clicking) (whimpering) Daddy! Heidi. Oh, jesus. How the hell did you get down here, baby, huh? What the hell? This is where the stationmaster hid 'em. Unbelievable. How the hell did you find this place, heidi, huh? A girl showed me. Is that the one that you said was down here with you? No. (sobs) I think something else is down here, too, daddy. I don't want to be here anymore. That makes two of us. Know the story of the stationmaster who helped slaves escape To freedom as part of the underground railroad. But last night, a young local girl Uncovered a sad, unknown chapter in the saga What authorities believe are the remains of five males... Reporter #2:... Discovered in a hidden underground chamber Beneath the ruins of the stationmaster's cabin. Now, the stationmaster, also known as jefferson gordy, Was the great grandfather of the late js gordy who died in 1978... Reporter #3: For all the lives that were saved by the underground railroad, There were also many folks who didn't make it. Just went missing. And today's discovery is a tragic reminder Of how dangerous it really was. In this particular case, When the stationmaster was murdered, There was no one to let the slaves out... - Can we please turn it off? - They probably starved to death down there. - Reporting live... - (tv off) You think that's mama kay's family? They said five males, so I doubt it. Hey. What are you doing up? I don't want to live here anymore. Joyce: It's all right now, heidi. The things that we saw, they've moved on. Their spirits aren't trapped anymore because of you. Joyce, please. Spirits? Don't you understand what's happened here, lisa? Those people in the chamber wanted to be found. That's what this has all been about. Now they're free. And there is nothing to be afraid of anymore. Mr. Gordy says it's not safe here. You see mr. Gordy tonight? He said I shouldn't have gone down in that hole. He said I let something bad come out. Okay, it is time for you to go back to bed. Heidi wyrick, you follow me right now. I can't be here anymore, mama. I went in the hole and the bad man saw me. He knows we're here now and he's coming. What bad man, sweetie? The stationmaster. I let him out, mama. Well, mr. Gordy is wrong because you know very well That the stationmaster was a good man. No, he wasn't. Andy, will you please tell her that there is nothing to be afraid of? Mr. Gordy said there was money buried in the garden, lisa, And there was. He said that Something terrible happened here, it did. For something in heidi's mind, Mr. Gordy is sure as hell right a lot. Are you telling me that suddenly you believe all this? I believe there was a cave full of skeletons on our land. Lisa, Was there a bad man down there, too? Hell if I know, But I say we pack up the truck and we haul our asses Out of here before we find out. Heidi. (buzzes) Andy. I mean, you can't be serious. We don't have anywhere to go. I mean, where... where are we gonna go? Baby, I... I'm sick. - Heidi and I... - you're fine. Heidi's fine. Tell me something. How the hell did heidi get down in that hole? Even if she could move that slab, which she can't, It's a 25-foot drop after that. She didn't have a scratch on her. Did you ever think that maybe joyce is right? Crazy joyce. That this isn't some kind of disease, but, I don't know, it's... A gift? A gift? You try seeing what I've seen and you call it a gift. I'm just saying maybe it is. And I'm done letting you tell our daughter That she's sick. That she's got some mental disorder. - L... - I love you. I do. But... - I won't... - (gasps) Let heidi live like this. You understand me? - I won't do it. - Andy, please. Look, I have seen enough to know that it ain't up here. It's out there. And maybe it's trying to tell us something. Maybe you should try listening. It's sure gonna be lonely here without you guys. You should leave, too. This is a bad place. No, sweetie, it was a bad place. Now it's not 'cause of you. I'm gonna miss you, baby girl. I'm gonna miss you, too. (chimes ringing) (door creaks) (voices whispering) (barks) Hey, chief. Come on, buddy. Hop up. Aw, good boy. Good boy. - (barking) - Hey. Chief.
