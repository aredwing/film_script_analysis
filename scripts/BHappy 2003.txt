I've only got a few weeks left here. I promise I'll change my ways. Don't tell me, try explaining to the girl. Girls, how are you all? Hello, hello Katty. No pushing; last one closes the door. How was your vacation? Fine. Let's write an essay... about what each one did on their vacation. I myself saw Aunt Carmen who's 93, a lovely old girl. Had a great time; she lives in Pichidangi. That's on the coast... You must be the new boy? That's right miss. Guillermo Gmez, or not? That's right, Guillermo... but they call me Chemo. Wonderful. Sit down Chemo; Choose where to sit and then stay there all term. ...she's 93 years old and is my Aunt Carmen... She's a happy person. It's very important in life to be happy, children... Very important, and she showed me to be... happy. Hello Katty... Waiting for the bus? Yes, I'm going home. It's about twenty minutes out in the country Do you mind if I ask. Is it true what they are saying, that your dad's in prison? Yes; so what? Hey Katty. Don't get angry, sorry... But it must be great to have a crooked dad. Mine comes home angry every single day. What's there to do here? Depends what you want. Well... I've just arrived from PuntaArenas. It's really pretty there, ships come from all over the world. ...like this one This is Chemo 2001. It's for you. So how did you get here They transferred my dad for work. But you know, I always wanted to go toArica. I don't know... Arica, Punta Arenas... I feel like I'm getting closer each time. - You're still here, hurry up. - I'm off. You'll arrive late... bye. Remember, put the cat out. Valparaiso, Copiapo, lquique, Arica... Need to make the list of all the items missing. Yeah. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. You're off? Yes... we're closed. And the goods? Franco, did you forget to give them to her?

See you tomorrow Franco. Until tomorrow... Say hi to Katty for me. How wonderful, spring's arrived! That's crazy, If you take us we'll pay for your pinball. Me first. I've told you not to smoke indoors... Are you going out? Just around here. But tomorrow you have to go to work, and it's dark. Keep cool... Why don't you stay in? Why stay, to watch TV? Don't give a shit aboutTV! Look Katty, in this life you can't choose your dad. You can choose a cat or a dog, but not your dad. What's yours is yours. You just have to live with it. Your dad's not so bad, it's worse to be a bastard. You'll learn to love him. But why me... a crook, and in jail. Just shut up Katty... You're making me miss my soap opera. Pass the salt. Leave it there. Here's to your dad, Katty. Come on, brighten up. You're so handsome... hair's greyer. And you honey bunny It's been ages since I've seen my mom so happy. Happy? Don't be dumb... It may look romantic... she's just horny! He always gets what he wants. Look how he's got her... relaxed. Shit this is good; hot and tasty You've gotten so big! Come and eat... Radomir, what are you going to do today? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? Why not go out, see if you can find a job. Don't hassle me, I've just gotten out. I'm looking a little pale. I'd be great if you could get a job. And stop all the gossip from going around. When I was in jail... And that's where I'm at... trying to be... positive. That's all very good, but you've got to do something. If you would do that... our lives would turn for the better Why not? I was just passing by... brought this for the house. Thanks Franco. Hey Radomir... how's it going? How was the vacation? So, so. Need a hand? Thanks. Thinking of staying long around here? We'll see... He's the same as ever, people don't change. Are you off to the village? I'm tired of this hell hole. All this shit around, the ducks, the pigs... So what are you waiting for? I just want to get away. To get some cash. I have a tour coming up that's taking me up north. Is that so? Perhaps you can be useful to me. You're my friend. Yeah. Yugoslav. What are you doing here? Just a few days ago. And how's business? I'm not mixed up in that scene anymore. Just working here, I'm happy, keep cool, get it? Last time they caught me, they beat the shit out of me. Who'd fucking believe it, you speaking like this. You've got a lovely girl, you should think about her Change your ways, don't get mixed up again. I hear they need people here, I can put you in touch. I'm looking for employees. What can you do? Everything... Look, around here, you've got to be responsible. These machines are heavy. Any accident involving a kid and we're done. Don't worry. But I need to tell you... I just got out ofjail. What the hell! I've got it all under control, no problem. Is she your daughter? Come and see me in 2... no... in a few weeks. Wait for me. Get in Katty... Thank you buddy! Get out Katty; we need to park the car. For me Radomiro? ...and with surround? And this is for you baby. ...old man ...can I keep it? - What's up? What do you mean? You think I'm stupid; where did you get the money? That's my business. You fucked up again... and who's the one that has to stay here! Quit bugging me! Go to hell! Katty, sit down. Look, here I am with my cousins... Here's grandpa'... grandpa' Mardovich He sure loved Chilean women! They sure would go crazy for any man with blue eyes. Arica... That's where the Mardovich first arrived, back in 1949. One day we'll go. Why not? Can I have this photo? Katty. You're... a Mardovich... Katty Mardovich! Bye daddy. Mom told you not to smoke in her room. What's it to you? Where did you get the money? Look... jump like this. Over here, come and dance. I've got a present for you. The Little Prince, I haven't heard of it... I wrote something... a dedication... I'm giving you this book full of words... which is another way to fly... Good luck Katty. And I signed it, Chemo 2001. The cake... the cake. Hey everyone... the cake's arrived. Mom I told you... dad promised he'd come. Something must have happened, let's start. No, we'll wait. That's right... the cake... wise up, he's not coming. He's never been there for you. Let's celebrate without him. And a one, and a two... See, I told you so... ...Good evening... Hello mam, we have a few questions to ask you. - You're having a party? - Yes, my girl's birthday - And how old is she? Fifteen... Fifteen... Looks like a lot of people. We're looking for a so called Radomir... There have been a lot of robberies around here. Kids, it's time to go; I'm sorry. Tomorrow I'll bring you some cake. You two, go to your rooms. - But mom. - Let's go Kid. Happy birthday, Katty. What's over there? Just mice, that's all... Take a look if you want. And your dad didn't bring you a present?

Just watch it. Great birthday I had... Good morning children! Morning miss. Whose late, Katty hurry up. Come on... I get the wallet. And the lighter, ...the lighter's mine, quick. Hello Katty. - Did you see the handbag. - What's going on? ...repeat. Or rather... be happy. Young people... Something serious has happened this morning. Someone stole Miss Lavalle's handbag. Whoever did it stand up... So no one did. Katty, come with me. Let's go thank you miss. Two girls saw you with the handbag in the toilet. Bring them if you want; I told you it wasn't me. If you took the purse just give it back... We only want to help you. Watch where you're heading. We have discussed your family problems before. Sit down Katty. It wasn't you, was it? You don't believe me, shit you're all the same. Fucking assholes! I'm not going back there again! Don't take it like that, it's not so serious. Hey, but one thing. Don't forget your promise. Hey... don't go crazy, it's not so serious. So how long do you think to carry on defending him? A delinquent... And all he's ever done is cause trouble. He's my kid's father ...and I don't like it when people mess him up. What can I say? If only you'd listen. More than once I've listened to you... You know very well... better not confuse things. He's still my husband for as long as he's alive. So pretty when you're angry Good afternoon. You're Mrs Mardovich? Can you come with us please? Follow me please. Radomir Mardovich Pe'96a... It was a terrible shoot out. This way please. Katty, stop it! That isn't Radomir. Are you sure? Of course. Totally? That's what I told you. Maybe they changed the tag. They told me on the right... and that's where I put it. Yeah, on the right! Things are getting too loose around here. And this one? It's Tulio mom. Shut up! You know the deceased? He was wearing your husband's clothes. I had nothing to do with it. You must tell the truth. You knew Tulio GonzalezArancibia. There was a robbery. You've lied to us mam', I'll have to file charges against you. And be grateful you're with your daughter, ...or else you'd be arrested. You always have to open that big mouth of yours. How often have I told you to shut up you stupid idiot! The mess you've got us in! But it was Tulio! What's it to you? You and your dad, I'm sick of both of you. No excuse this time. He's not setting foot in my house ever again! Open your eyes. Smile. Turn around. You look like a good girl. Ask Gloria for credit on some milk and oil... ...before the bus arrives, quickly... Hey mom! Nelson's car's over there. Don't get like that mom. Don't cry. Come on mommy, I'll take you home... Get in sis', I'll take you. Is that right, Nelson? What's up sis'? Where's Danilo He went out. I feel nauseous. Call our neighbor Juana. Hello... Juanita. Who is it? What's up? What's wrong Mercedes? For god's sake! I've got such a headache, I can't see clearly. These flu bugs today, they're not like before. My sister got it hard; spent two days as twisted as a hen. I can't feel my toes... And your brother, when does he arrive? Don't know; we never know. We can't do anything now ...but early tomorrow I'll take you to the clinic. For now... here's some pain killers... Bye Mercedes, please brighten up. ...sleep with me, darling. Mom, mom, wake up. Cometh the day when the buried shall hear his voice. The good will resurrect and return to life. Those of evil deeds will suffer damnation. My brother's, don't be sad. Can I stay with you? I can't sleep. What shall we do? Dad isn't coming back, is he? Just have to get by... like everyone else. We'll be all right. It's all business... and what do politicians do - make more money... All in it for themselves... Well it's the 15th and your credit's at its limits. Katty, Clean that quickly so it's nice and clean... What are you doing? It's that I've found a job ...along with Nelson. But not around here so I need to make a move. You're leaving me alone? No way, just a few weeks. And who knows if... making love... all night long... I end up singing in the band. You're going... and never coming back. I told you no... Let's go. Coming... Up to Arica and around then back, just one week. Why don't you lend us some cash for the girl? This is just an advance. Don't get used to it. I don't want that money A little to keep you going. Making love... It'll all be fine, ciao She's not in... I'm not afraid of anything, ...neither gypsies ...or night I'm not afraid of anything Dad is it you? ...did you read the book? I've got another one, Sisiphus. About a man who has to carry a stone over a peak. Well, it's impossible... but he's condemned to do it over and over again. It's really good. Must be really crazy living all alone. Aren't you afraid? At the beginning, but you learn to live with fear. And that painting? They say it's the devil. When I was a kid I used to have a copy just like it. I came about the rabbits. You did invite me... I went yesterday. But I've got an idea. Take your shirt off. What? I said, take your shirt off. Fine. Are you afraid? No, I'm not afraid. And now your pants. What for? What do you think? Why are you laughing; do I look funny? No you look lovely. Lie down. Do you like me? And this little surprise? I don't know. They say that the first time you do it... you never forget... So... l'll never forget you. Your eyes, the silly things you talk about... ...your smell... But don't worry, all I want... is some affection. ...hold on... where are you going? Just round here, then of home. How about you? Nowhere, just here... What happened with Chemo? Oh, nothing... Tell me, you promised to. Go on... We were alone at home. And what happened? Everything... Did it hurt? ...then it was beautiful. Got to get used to it... And what's Chemo like? A bit shy, but tender. Something you choose in life. If you can't pick your dad... or your country... ...at least you can choose your first guy. Sure. There, looks great. Like the shop girl said. Look how lovely she looks with the top I bought her You made a gesture just like your mom... Every day mother watches and protects you. She'll send you a good man ...one who really loves you. Ok, get going. Look after the girl. Hey pretty babe... Lousy celery the other day; not buying yours any more. Ok, want anything else? Whatever you want... Raul, whatever she wants, just bring it to her A bright girl like you... ...doesn't need to be alone. Why wait for your dad? Why, won't he come back? Look, he's in Valparaiso. Probably in jail. But understand, with me, you'll lack nothing. Cut it out. I'm getting out. What's wrong, what's wrong, Where are you going Katty? Where are you coming from? Just took Katty home. Why do you look like shit? Crashed into some animals some idiots left on the road. They said the truck was in a field. What were you up to? What field - that's those same idiots whose animals... I want to lie down; got a headache. Go to bed on your own. Button your shirt. Morning neighbour; sleep well? Like some breakfast? - Hi boys, I'm here. - You're here fag. Luchita, long time no see; - So the avocados arrived? Of course. Sit over there. You're wrong young lady, your dad's not detained here. But they told me... The last we knew he was in the hospital. You live with a relative? No, alone, I just got here. I've got an idea... We'll send you somewhere... Get in. She is also going to corrections. Tell them she has no record, they will contact them. But I haven't done anything. Get in. Don't you be watching me girl. I'll smash your face in! Come on, dump them. Young ladies look closely at that gentleman... Jose Errazuriz Zepeda ...who, fifty years ago, donated this building... ...so that you, young girls of ill repute... ...could have a decent home. Another one here by mistake. Tell me you stole some gum. Do you want a smoke? Watch your back or they'll fuck you like they did to my sister She was even on the news. Want me to tell you why? Sure you don't want me to tell you, Katty? Quickly, into the shower. Ticklish Katty? Here we'll wash your butthole... This bread's so hard.
