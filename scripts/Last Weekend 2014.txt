Hi. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. Why is your hair so sticky? Oh. You have to meet Luke. Where is he? Luke! He's the boyfriend, right? No, no. He is not my boyfriend. Okay, okay. Just lover? Nora? Hello. Celia, it's been so long. Mwah. Oh, oh. - Mwah. - Okay. How continental we are these days. I guess that's how it is in Hollywood. Celia, this is Sean Oakes. Hi. Great to meet you. - Hello. - Hi. Hey, I-I'm Luke. Oh, Mom, this is Luke Caswell. Yes, I-I know. I suppose I could say I've heard so much about you, except that I haven't because Theo never tells his parents anything. I've been busy. Thank you so much for having us. The weather is perfect. Yeah, you have a really beautiful home here. Yes. Well, you all must be exhausted. Do you get service here now? I just need to check in with my assistant. No. We still don't get cell service on the property. No one does in the bay. Sometimes you can get a text message. Everyone thinks it's charming. It's goddamn annoying. You'll have to call from inside. Come on. Roger and Vanessa are bringing all the food I ordered from Ikeda's. Hope they get here soon, or we might have to start eating our limbs like the Donner party. Who wants iced tea? Hey. "Welcome to our cabin." That's cute. Is that what we're calling Tahoe lake houses these days? Theo, stop it. I bought it from that lady at the farmers' market who sells local folk art. "Made in China." Well, why don't you show everyone where they're sleeping? Nora, you'll be in the front guest room. Theo, you and Luke will be in your old room. Whoa, why aren't we staying in the guest house or in the Stone Room? Your brother and Vanessa will be in the guest house. I thought you'd want to be in your old room. Right. I'm almost 30, and I want to stay in my childhood bedroom. It doesn't even have a double bed. Well, put the beds together. Mm-mm. No, we're sleeping in the Stone Room. Fine. I don't care. Put your friend... What's her name, the actress? Blake. Put Blake and her guest in your room, though the Stone Room gets cold, remember, and I don't want you leaving the electric heater on at night. You'll burn the place down. And that enormous car... Is it going to stay in the driveway? Where did it come from? Did you rent it? What does it matter? I just don't like you driving. Mom, why do you care? You have never been completely comfortable behind the wheel, and you live in New York. No one ever drives in New York. We're going up. Come on. I only want you to be safe. Ah, and here we are, the Stone Room. - It's beautiful. - Yeah. I thought you said that your mom was crazy. She is crazy. No, she's not. Okay, most people have trains of thought. My mom has, like, 15,000 Post-it notes flapping around. She seems fun, more fun than my family. I mean... Is that the guest house? No, that is where the caretaker lives. That is the guest house. It used to belong to this couple from Nob Hill. They drank a lot. Ugh. Hey, how come you don't live in San Francisco? Oh, my parents. I love them, but it... We just shouldn't spend too much time very close together, you know? Yeah. Is this your old room? Yeah. Oh. It is so cute. Guess so. Oh, uh, don't... don't touch those. Sorry. It's okay. God damn it! Don't you have to hit pound at the end? Babe, I just think that... No. You need to tell your parents at some point. It's not like they won't find out. Right, I should just walk in the door and announce it. Maybe this happened for a reason. Why does there have to be a reason? You said it yourself. You hated working at Watkins. It was a stupid, dipshit mistake, okay? Nothing more than that. What happened? - Nothing. - Don't I get a hello? Hi. Vanessa, what happened? I don't know. I just... He always takes everything so personally. I'll get the cart and help you unload the car. Thank you so much. It's nice to see you. Of course. I brought you this just as, you know, a thank-you for having us and everything. You don't need to do that. You don't need to do anything. We'll open this later. Sure. The produce looks... wonderful. - Doesn't it? - Mm-hmm. Oh, you brought us some of your water. Such a cute name... FreshWater. How are things going with that? Great. Um, we just introduced two new flavors, and we're going to be in Whole Foods next month. Yeah, I just... you know, I thought it would be fun. I totally understand if nobody wants any of it. Don't be absurd. Of course people will drink it. It's water. Go ahead and get yourself settled in the guest house. It looks like Roger might need you. And try to find out what he's so upset about. We brought you this. Oh. Oh, thank you. This is perfect. You know I hate getting things. I mean, where would I put them? This place is completely full. I mean, this is wonderful... preserves, mandarin pumpkin butter. Oh, ginger Asian pear. We can eat this all up, throw this away, and it'll be like it was never here. - I'm so glad. - Mm. Whoo! What in the world? - Hey! - Whoo! That was great. - Whoo! - Whoo-hoo! Oh! What are you guys doing? Dropping by? I love it. Nobody drops by anymore. - Mwah. - Mwah. - It was nothing. - We were in the neighborhood. Oh, look at you two, swimming. Oh, my God, every time I come up here, I think I'm gonna go in, and then the whole time passes, and I forget to do it. This is... - Ooh, that feels good. - Whoo-hoo! So are you going to the "Save the Lake" benefit on Sunday? I think we have to. Did you want to join my table? Oh, we already have our tickets. Veronika asked us if we wanted to be her guests. Bring this down. That's great. Both? - Really? - Mm. Oh, did you hear that she's, um, going to do more construction? You're kidding me. After everything that we went through while she rebuilt that? I thought you were gonna do something more on your house. Actually... Malcolm and I, uh, have talked about selling and doing something simple. - No. - No. Please don't tell anybody. We're still not sure if it's gonna happen. - You're not. - You can't. I mean, we probably won't. The kids should get the house anyway. I mean, God knows they don't even appreciate it, but maybe a younger family would enjoy it more. I wish I could be one of those people who can just let go. Sweetie, you can't let go of anything. Why not just keep the house as an investment? Ah, the market... It seems decadent to own two... vacation houses. Celia Green. What? You have more money than entire ZIP codes in San Francisco. You can afford to keep both houses. I know. It's just... You reach an age... Um... I'm... I'm so tired of my life being safe. Mm-hmm. But this house... They don't make houses like this anymore. Mm-mm. I-I don't know who else deserves to live here. Remind me why we're here again? What were we going to do... Spend the weekend in Westwood? Oh, you... - Oh, really? - Yeah. Oh, okay. I get it. Theo Green. So high school friend wants a movie deal. Is it any good? Have you even read it yet? Don't be a brat. Theo just sent it to me a few weeks ago. I mean, what do you do when you're staying at someone's house, eating their food, and you have to critique their work? Well, what do you tell all the other wannabe screenwriters? Usually, I just say, "It's good. It's great. I'll get back to you with notes," and then I just... don't. Well, at least wait until the end of the weekend to tell him how you feel. Yeah. Everything's gonna be all right. I know. Does Mom need any help? Uh, don't worry about it. You work hard. You deserve to relax. I guess that's the thing now, Fridays off. All the young people take Fridays off in the summer. It's Labor Day weekend, Dad. I didn't take a Friday off until I turned 50. Well... Does she need any help? No, she said she had it under control. Ooh. Ha-ha. Where's everyone else? Don't you have another, uh, friend coming? Blake and her guest are arriving later. Ooh. I can't believe that you're friends with Blake Curtis. Why would she want to be friends with a writer on her show? Oh, shut up, Roger. Isn't that like hanging out with the help? She likes the lines that I write for her. Well, you certainly decided to bring an entourage with you. You used to bring your frat buddies up here all the time. - They were my brothers. - Uh, actually, no. I'm your brother. Well, at least I don't bring B-list TV actresses whose ass I'm kissing. I love Blake Curtis. We watch The Boardroom every Sunday. You watch The Boardroom every Sunday. See, I have the unconditional support of my family. Should we try the lake? Thought you said it was freezing. It'll turn your balls into popcorn kernels. - That's so funny. - Mm-hmm-hmm. Yeah, 'cause you already have popcorn kernel balls. Ow! Ow! Stay away from my balls. How'd you like it if I did that to you? Oh, he's so sensitive. You gonna run and call Mom? Roger, Theo, Vanessa. - How are you? - Good, thank you. Good, good, good. Hector, this is Luke. Oh, hey. Hi. Is everything all right in there? Yeah, it's great. Um, you been having a good summer? Yeah. Just shout if you need anything. Thanks, Hector. - See you. - Nice to meet you. I always feel like such a prick for relaxing while he's on duty. Roger, his job is to take care of the house. Why shouldn't you be allowed to relax while he's working? Thank you. Mm. That's nice. Hey, what's up with the floor in our bathroom? I thought you said you were gonna redo it in bamboo. What floor? I don't... I don't know what you're talking about. The bathroom floor in the guest house, the one with that nasty 1970s linoleum you never replaced. Oh, that. Roger, bamboo is expensive. I know it's sustainable, but it didn't make sense to spend the money when, uh... When what? Nothing. Just when you're hardly ever here. We use the house all the time. Oh, come on. How many times did you drive up here this summer? The three holiday weekends, right? No. It was more than that. It was the three holiday weekends. Celia, would you like a glass of wine? Eh, just a splash. I mean, you don't use the house as much as you used to, and you... Thank you... And your... your brother is always in New York. Do you want the guest house to look like it's stuck in some crappy, cheapo time warp, or do you really... Roger, that's enough. I think you have more important things to concern yourself with than renovating a bathroom. What does that mean? What she means is that you and your brother should be more concerned with making money than our spending it. Do not bring me into this one. I have to get dinner on the table. Oh, God. I hope I got enough salmon. It was on sale at the supermarket, but I only got five pounds. You got fish on sale? Why do you do that? Roger, someday when you've made enough money of your own, you'll understand what it means not to waste it. Now, just start grilling, please? - Mmm. - Mmm. - Theo? - Mm? Where are Blake and her guest? I set ten place settings. Um, her friend got called in on a last-minute shoot, so it's just gonna be her. I still think it's crazy that Blake Curtis wouldn't have somewhere better to spend the holiday. Get over it, Roger. She likes hanging out with me. Next we're gonna see you in one of those magazines as the unidentified friend that she's having coffee with while the paparazzi snaps her photo. Seriously, no peppering her with questions about what it's like to be famous, okay, Mom? Oh, come on. Give us a little credit, Theo. We have celebrities in San Francisco. Celia, this table looks really beautiful. Does anybody want some of this? I brought a FreshWater variety pack. It's fine. We'll drink it tomorrow. Uh, how is the salmon? Did Roger overcook it? - No. - No, it's... - No, hey... - No, it's really good. It's good. Thanks. Oh, I almost forgot. This meal was designed according to a special diet I just read about, and you don't count calories or fat or cholesterol or... - This is good. - What do you count? Carbon emissions. It's not funny. It's all about CO2 emissions. Every food item has a number of points depending on where it came from, how it was transported, whether it was local or from South America or... Yeah, they started doing that at our food co-op. - Oh. - Thank you, Sean. - See? - Sure. Food co-op. Um, so, what's the point count for this meal? Mm. I don't actually remember. I think... Maria, what was it? It was 345, unless you count the bread. Mm. Oh, you know, it's... it's tricky. The bread is from a bakery in town, but they wouldn't tell me if their flour was local or from farther away, and the other ingredients, they didn't know about those, either, which is really quite shocking, so if you don't eat the bread, you're at 345. And, um, is 345 good or bad? What does it matter? It's somewhere in the middle... I think. Another crusade fought theoretically. What would the world do without women like your mother? Everyone, happy Labor Day weekend. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Thank you for having us. We're so pleased to have you here. - Yeah. - Absolutely. - Cheers. - Cheers. Glad to have you here. Hey, guys. Everyone, everyone. Dad, Blake doesn't drink alcohol, so don't offer her any wine. She doesn't like to drink? No, Dad, she is a recovering alcoholic and an addict. She can't drink. Not even one glass? What a shame. Oh, a drug addict? - Imagine. - Okay, Mom. You don't have to make a big deal out of it. Jesus Christ. Does everyone have enough wine? Drink up while you can. Mom. Oh, hey! Hi. Oh, my goodness. I made it. I survived. Oh, my God. You have no idea. What, did she ride a donkey from New York or something? Thank you so much. Wow. Sorry I'm late. - It's okay. - I'm so sorry. Hello. Thank you so much for having me, Mrs. Green. - Thank you. - Oh, uh, Celia, please. Let me introduce everyone. This is Malcolm, my husband. Hi. - Nora, Sean, Luke... - Mm-hmm. Roger, my other son, and Vanessa. Hi. - And you know Maria, of course. - I do, yes. I'll bring the bags up to your room. Thank you. Thanks so much. Um, oh, and I have, uh, a little bit of something. - Oh. - Thank you. - Oh. - Look at that smile. She's such a dirty star fucker. Um, I would love a shower if that's okay? - Yeah, sure. I'll... - Yeah? - I'll take you up to your room. - Great. - Okay, all right. - Come on. - Ooh. - She's sweet and... She is so much smaller than I thought she would be. Oh, actors always are. I thought she'd be more top-heavy. That's not what I meant. You know, I had the most incredible breasts when I was 23. I-I didn't even have to wear a bra. - Eh. - It's true. Wow. Now she's gonna show you pictures of your honeymoon in Saint-Tropez. I think I have some of those pictures. I know I do. You okay? You all right? I'm sorry, I just... I can't... No, I can't breathe. - Give him some water. - He's choking. Does anybody know the Heimlich? - Jesus. - Here, take... take some water. You want some water? Oh, my God, his neck is all... is all red. Is he allergic to the salmon? Uh, we need... we need that... that allergy thing, that thing you bought... I don't know if I still have it. - I don't remember. - Well, did you use it? - I'm not sure. I don't know. - Well, let... let's look for it. - All right. - Here. - Get him some water. - Drink some water. - Have you used it? - Of course not. I didn't use it. I just don't know where it is. It's so messy under here. I keep meaning to reorgan... Roger! Roger, please don't make such a mess. - Well, at least help me. - All right, all right. Tampons? What are these doing here? Oh, Mom, come on. Focus. You have to find it. Well, it could be anywhere. I mean, does he really need it? That needle is expensive. $75. I mean, what if someone gets a bee sting this weekend? Would you like him to die instead? No, of course not. Oh, here it is. Take it. Whoa, what... what are you doing? Luke's having an allergic reaction to something. - I've got to give him this. - What? Wait, well, do you know what you're doing? Allergic to what? Local discount salmon, I guess! Roger's coming. You're gonna be fine. He's got the medicine, okay? Oh, oh, my God. - Okay. - Mm. Oh! - Count to 15. - Ten seconds. It says to rub the puncture area after. On three, two, one. Be careful with that. Someone could get hurt. Are you okay? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, can you breathe? Yeah. - You feeling better? - You poor thing. Have you ever eaten salmon before? Mom! No, I haven't had it that much. See, there you go. Okay, Mom, what does it matter, okay? - All right. - Come on, let's go inside. - You okay? - Yeah. Okay, come on. Can you walk? Ah, I'm sorry, everybody. I... That's okay. Oh, my God. You. Come with me. Do not speak to me. - Come with me now. - Take your hand... - Take your hands off me. - Then walk by yourself. - What is your problem? - Into the house. Roger, do not speak to me that way. Now what? What's wrong? - Want some water? - Okay. He couldn't breathe from your meal. Are you out of your fucking mind? Oh, you are so rude. You know nothing about these sorts of things. Do you know how many bee stings happen up here? He... he didn't have a bee sting, Mom! - And I might need this. - He was suffocating! Theo, she wasn't gonna look for the medicine. She said that it was too expensive to use. Roger is misrepresenting the situation. You're joking. I go inside for five minutes, and my boyfriend almost dies. - Theo, darling, please. - Shh. We'll talk about this later. I don't want the kid to find out. It's just in the middle of this dinner I've prepared for you, my mind is in a thousand places. Mom, this isn't for us. It's for you. That's... That's not true. It's not. Malcolm, can you believe this? I think what everyone needs to do is just calm down. I'm gonna go back and finish dinner. I...honestly, Mom, you're embarrassing. Well... They're boyfriends now. That's nice. Why don't you go back outside? No. I want to have dessert by the fire. Maria. But I've always wanted to redecorate this house. We... we never really decorated in the first place. Our life was much simpler back then. Hmm. We bought some furniture from a shop in town. It was already upholstered. Now it's six-month lead time and custom everything. You can't buy a chair for under $10,000. Christ, Mom. You sound like Veronika Goss. Decorating is the single thing I have in common with that woman, though I can't stand her ridiculous taste. Who are we talking about? Oh, the people who live next door, the Gosses. They moved into this beautiful gem of a house. Oh. And then they tore it down and built that thing they're living in now. We had to put up with construction next door for two summers in a row. Who needs 3 bedrooms when you can have 16 bedrooms? Forgive me for asking, but how do the Gosses make their money? Air-conditioning. - Hmm. - Yes, I know. No more less genteel than us. We make exercise equipment. They make air-conditioning. The funny thing, of course, is that they bought a vacation house in the one part of the country that you don't need air-conditioning. It's typical, this sort of nouveau riche thing. Mom, aren't we kind of nouveau riche? Your father has been successful since before you were born. He didn't make his money yesterday, inventing, I don't know, some website or something. It's those types of people who are our neighbors now. This area's crawling with venture capitalists and dot-commers all building their mega mansions. That must be good for the local economy. No, it's immigrants that provide most of the workforce... mainly Hispanics. Drives up the crime rate. Malcolm. I read it in the paper. Burglaries, rapes, even murders. I certainly don't want to be raped. Does anybody want another drink? Yes, please. What about Hector and Maria? Hector and Maria are not like the others. Remember the crew that worked on the boathouse? Yeah. They cleaned us right out. First it was a case of beer. Then it was the tools. I'm gonna go help Maria. Malcolm. I should go. Oh, no, save that piece. Can I do anything here? No. We've got it covered. Hi, Celia. Hector, did Malcolm talk to you about the light on the dock? Yeah. Ooh. - Hello. - Hi. I'm Celia's neighbor, Veronika. - Oh. - She's probably mentioned me. She did. I had no idea. I had heard you were staying there, but I didn't believe it. I love your show. Thank you. Are you coming to the benefit tomorrow? Um, you know, I don't know. I'm not really sure. Oh, well, if Celia didn't buy you a ticket, you come as my guest, okay? Oh. Oh, I really couldn't. But thank you. That's so nice. Um, I'm sorry. I just have to keep running. It was really nice to meet you, though. Nice to meet you. I feel good about my life. I release the need for self-criticism. Do we make our beds? Uh, Maria will do it. Don't you think it seems rude or sloppy or something not to? What are you doing? I don't like the mint flavor. I don't know why you opened it for me. Well, you don't have to pour it out. Jesus, what is wrong with you? I'm just trying to clean up a little bit before Maria does her thing. Wait a minute. Is this why you won't talk to your dad about getting the waters in the gyms... because you hate them? No, no. No. But you hate this flavor. It tastes like toothpaste backwash. It's supposed to. A little bit. It freshens your breath. People like it. It's one of our top sellers. I'll... I'll talk to him. Okay? I will talk to him. Just not... this weekend. Why are you always so, like, making things happen? Why can't you ever just let things be? I doubt your father built his business on just letting things be. I... I will talk to him, but... You know, there are a ton of people who would have to approve something like this. It's not like he can just snap his fingers and make it happen. I get it. Do your parents get the paper here? I can't get a signal. Yeah. Yeah, they get it delivered. I know. I want to go to the farmers' market before everything good is gone. Theo, you'll come with me? Sure. Don't worry, Luke. - You don't have to go. - Okay. Are you feeling okay? I'm so sorry you had to go through all that last night. No, I'm feeling so much better. - No, thank you. - Eggs? - Oh, he can't have any. - Oh. I had a heart attack 22 years ago. Actually, it's what motivated me to start Green Machines. - Really? - Morning. Hi. - Hello. - Hey, how are you? How are you? - Good morning. - Oh, hi. Um, I had a strange encounter with your neighbor. That's Veronika. Don't talk to her. Where's the business section? - You're asking me? - Yes. Does anyone want more coffee? - Oh, yes, please. - Roger. - Oh, I'll have some coffee. - I'll have some. Maybe Maria... - Hold on. - Oh, yeah. I would take some of that. - Hurry! - Can you pass me a muffin? Yes, but we have to find sunflowers. I want to find the perfect sunflowers for the table tonight. Well, go to the flower stand. Oh. This stuff is always so beautiful. How much is this? It's $20. And that's all fair trade. - I'll take these two. - Great. Wow. And this. Great. Oh, this bowl is stunning. And it was made locally. Oh, that's great. I'll take that. How much? It's $180 altogether. Um, Theo, can you help me with everything, please? Mom, why are you buying all this stuff? Where are you gonna put it? Even the garage is full. I don't know what I'm doing. I should probably stop. Who knows how long we're gonna be here anyway? - Thank you. - Thank you. What... What do you mean by that? Well, it's your house, but you and Roger are hardly ever here. When you were children, it was wonderful, but now... You can't sell the house. We grew up here. You'll never do it. Besides, what about Hector and Maria? - What'll happen to them? - Hector and Maria will be fine. You know we'll always take care of them. The lake used to be such a simple place, no pretensions. It just... I mean, so many of our friends have... have left. It's difficult to see things change. Oh, shit. Hold on. What? There's something in my contact. Darling, why don't you and Luke stay past Monday? We could spend the week together. Mom, you know I can't do that. I have a job. There are people who expect me to show up. They would understand. They know you don't need the money. Mom, why the fuck would you say that? You know how hard I work. Oh, Theo, of course. Don't get hysterical. I'm so proud of you. How about you come next year for more than a weekend? Oh, my God. How about for two weeks? Remember how you used to love the antique boat show and the Fourth of July fireworks? You really think I plan my summers a year in advance? Ask Roger. He's closer. This is all you ever do. You two just brush me aside. I get one weekend with my two sons together for the first time in years, but that's all you'll give me. Is that how it's gonna be from now on? Next you'll forget my birthday too. Calm down. Everyone remembered your birthday. Does your brother just hate me? No. Of course he doesn't hate you. He is so difficult with me all the time. I still can't stand the idea of Vanessa. What if he gets her pregnant? Okay, you could be a little nicer to her. Oh, cherries. We need dried cherries. For the salad. Mom... Hmm? You know, you could care a little bit more about who I date. What do you want me to say? The boy seems perfectly nice. You scrutinize everyone Roger dates, picking apart every little flaw, which I know is completely annoying, but at least it means you care. I get treated like I... I brought home the boyfriend version of a Christmas fruitcake. "Oh, he's perfectly nice." - What? - That's funny. "Fruitcake." That's not what I meant. Well, it's a... it's a joke. Mom, I'm going back to the car. Have fun picking out more crap that you don't need. There's your stupid sunflowers. Don't take everything so seriously. I... What is Hector doing? I think he's fixing the light. How do you read that shit? Oh, come on. Blake is in this issue. Really? That's so weird. Hey! - Oh, my God. - Hector? - Hector! - Wait. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no, Roger. It's not safe. Turn off the power. Hold on, Hector! Fuck. Hey! You're okay, man. You're okay. What happened? Roger. He got... he got electrocuted... - What? - Fixing that... the light. He fell in the water. Oh, my God. He's unconscious? Get on the left. Are you okay? I'm okay. Be careful, guys. Well, what do we do now? Well, I have to tell Maria. I mean, she should be back any minute from the market. Oh, God. We have to go to the hospital. - All of us? - No, not everyone. - Well, you need to go. - Right. And Theo and I should go. Roger, we can't all go. We have guests. Is that really important right now? We can't just leave everyone here. Don't worry about us. We'll be fine. Theo, you know, he's right. - You stay. - Thank you. I'm... I'm... Malcolm, let's get the car. I'm gonna call Maria from the car. - Okay, I'm gonna come. - We'll call you. - All right. - I'm gonna get changed! - Come on, Roger. - Yeah. Come on, Malcolm. What are we supposed to do the rest of the day? I don't know. It seems inappropriate to, like, enjoy ourselves. I still can't believe that just happened. Mm. It's water with just a hint of flavor, no calories. There are four main styles... Fresh Mint, Plain, Power Punch, and Berry Me. "Berry Me"? Yeah, like, like berry, like strawberry, raspberry. Oh, I-I get it. Do you guys think these are still good? They expired a week ago. Of course they're still good. They're pickled. Mm. Nurses' station. Yes... Where did Maria go? To the chapel to pray. Why do you have to make fun of that? Maybe her faith is important to her. I...I am not making fun of it. - You are. - I am not. Sit down. It just seems pointless. Why does she need to go to some crappy little chapel to pray? Why can't she pray just right here? I'm sure that you would find a way to complain about that too. I hate this kind of water. That's what they have. I hate it. You couldn't get a paper? They were all out. I need some air. Okay. It seems like she has a meal planned for tonight, but I can't make out her handwriting. Does this say that these vegetables are supposed to be grilled or broiled? I can't tell. Maybe broiled? I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter. Well, what should we do? Should we eat on the stone table again? It just seems so unlike Celia to do the same thing two nights in a row. Why do you care? She's not gonna be here. - I just... you know. - It's not worth trying. She's a total perfectionist. No one will ever be good enough. Good enough for what? I've known Celia since Theo and I were friends in high school. She can smell fear. You can use that one. Okay. Just grab... Yeah, grab that edge and spin it. And get lower. Okay. Yeah. That was good. I bet you wish you were still in New York. No, I'm... I'm having a really fun time. Why, do you... do you wish I wasn't here or... No. No, I'm glad you're here. Me too. I appreciate the ticket. Oh, it was nothing. I use miles, so it's like Monopoly money. It doesn't count. Does anybody need anything? There's... there's more chicken and salad. Hello! Celia, we're here! - Hi! - Oh, gosh. The traffic was a nightmare, and then Richard dragged us to this awful cocktail party. Hi. I didn't ask if he and Howard could stay, so it's just us. - Hi, honey. - Hi. I hope that's okay. That's fine. - What are we... what are we doing? - Oh, we're here for dinner. Where are your parents? - Your mom asked us to dinner. - Oh. Oh, my God, guys, there's been an accident. What? No! - What happened? - Oh, no, it was nothing. Well, ugh, it wasn't... I mean, it wasn't nothing. It was terrible. It was Hector. It was our caretaker. - Oh. - Oh, oh, okay. My parents are on their way back from the hospital. Oh, that's so sweet of them. So these are for you. - Okay. Sure. - Would you care to join us? We can get you some chairs or... - Yeah. That would be... - Do you want... - Thank you. - Want some wine? - Red or white? - Yes. Your parents love you boys so much. Do you know how much your parents love you? - Do you? - Yeah. Oh, my God. - If my kid... - Oh. If our kids ever came to visit us. I only see them when they need money. You and Roger are so good to your parents. They said that? You are. Your mom... Oh, my God. You mean everything to her. Yeah. It's real. Damn it. I missed the sunset. Oh, my... oh. - Theo? - Mm. Mm? Why are you down here? Get up. You scared me half to death. - Oh, for fuck's sake. - What are you doing? Get up. - How did I get down here? - What? Is Luke up? How many sleeping pills did you have before bed? I'm an insomniac. It's... I can't help it. Oh. PB&J? Maybe. Mmm. I really like him. Only been three weeks. And I don't know if it'll last. It never seems to last. Theo. Why are you saying that? I was bombed when I met him. I thought it was gonna be a one-night stand and... Mm. Blake? Do you ever think it's not gonna get any better than this? Yeah, Theo. You know, we all make choices. And at some point, that becomes your life, and you can't postpone it, and you can't wait for something better to come along. Will you just please promise me you'll be careful with the pills because I need you in my life. Yeah. Do you want to come running with me tomorrow? No. Yes, I would. I would rather sit in a dumpy hospital waiting room than go to some party where everyone wants to know what I'm up to these days. And Theo is showing off his TV star plaything like she's so great. Who cares? That's not why he brought her. They're friends. They have become friends, but it's very convenient. He might as well be carrying around an Emmy. You know, every single thing we've ever done, every project, every job, the questions our parents ask are, "How much are you being paid?" and "Can you really support yourself on that?" And so now that Theo finally can support himself, he needs to rub everyone's face in it. Roger, you need to tell your parents. But what am I gonna say? I'm... a fucking idiot, and I made a typo on a trade that cost my company $30 million. I just hate all those people, all those fucking people who are gonna be judging me. You made a mistake. It happens. You should take off that makeup. People don't wear makeup to breakfast in Lake Tahoe. You have to go. We can't just leave the table empty. It's so rude. It's not appropriate. Hector almost died yesterday, and we still don't know how he's doing. He should be fine. You don't know that. You say these things, "He should be fine," without any basis of truth in them. Roger, if you don't go, it makes too big a deal of the accident. People will start talking. And that's all that you care about, isn't it? Of course... no, of course not. Your father and I will go to the hospital and wait with him. Why do you get to go to the hospital while the rest of us have to be trotted out at a benefit like show ponies? Well, we need to be there. Hector is like family to us. I thought you always said the staff wasn't like family. I said they're not family, but that doesn't mean they're not like family. There's a difference. Ow! Shit! Oh. Are you okay? What time is it? Did breakfast happen already? Calm down. You're fine. God damn it. What? Fucking Nora. She hasn't said anything to me about my screenplay yet. I sent it to her three weeks ago, and... And just... It's been a long time since I've written one, so I'm nervous. I thought if I invited her for the weekend, she would have finished it by now. What? Nothing. Well, you're looking at me like I'm an asshole. No, I'm not. I... No, it's your work. Of course you care about it. I care about it. Is everyone set for the benefit? Did everybody get enough breakfast? I-I think everybody's okay. I mean, people have just been grazing, and there's plenty of fruit and bagels and things, so... I really wanted to make waffles this morning. Hmm. I guess one can't do everything. Malcolm! We're leaving! I have to ask her what does she want me to do? Love your dress. This is all such bullshit. You know what? I'm so sick of you judging everything. I mean, have you ever thought it's people like this who have paid your way through graduate school? I... Honey, who do you think endows scholarships and research centers? People who actually care about making the world a better place. See, they're trying to curb environmental erosion and stop people from building docks and stuff. These people who have a dock. Oh, my God. He is so negative. You don't say a thing... Kids? Are you having a great time? - Mm-hmm. - But where are your parents? Oh, how is your caretaker? That sweet man. He's fine. Oh, hold on. Mm. Ooh. Mmm. Smile. - Thank you. - Aw. How fun. Now, Vivian tells me your parents are selling their house. - Is that true? - No. They would never do that. Gorgeous party. Beautiful. Oh, thank you. Um... I'm, uh, Veronika, by the way. Oh, hi. Luke. - Hello, Luke. - Hi, how are you? So are you guys... Oh, um, sure. So cute. Are you from New York? What do your parents do? Uh, food service and janitorial. That's terrific. There's a lot of money in that. No, there's not. Do you want your bags? - No, I don't want it. - Ugh, my feet. Look at all this stuff. We can probably give the T-shirts to Maria if we don't want them. Hmm. Might take these shampoos too. Yeah, like, "Sorry your husband got electrocuted." "Here's a free T-shirt from some benefit you can't afford to go to." Roger. She always appreciates it when Mom gives them to her. She uses them as cleaning rags. Well, I'm keeping mine. I think it's cute. Look at this. This should have been my water in there. Is he here yet? Is who here? The curator from the Indian Museum. He was gonna look at my basket collection. No, no. I haven't seen anyone. Oh. We rushed all the way from the hospital. I had completely forgotten I had made the appointment. What are you doing with your baskets? Why are you doing this today? It was the only time they could see me. I-I want to donate some of my baskets and pots to the little museum in town. I don't want it all to be auctioned off at Bonhams or whatever when I'm... old. So you're giving away a bunch of stuff? Well, it's not like you and your brother want any of it. This way, I'll know it's safe. I might want them. What, are you gonna sell the house too? Is that what's next? I have to get ready for the curator. How was the party? - Sorry. - Wonderful. Thank you. Oh. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. - One second. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Just tell me when it's okay to look. - Okay. - Hmm. Sorry. It's okay? Yeah, you're all right. Yeah? Okay. Hmm. Uh, do you want to take her out for a spin? She's almost ready to go. Uh... Yeah, I mean, are you sure? I mean, don't you want to go with Vanessa or something? Um... I don't know where she is. Um... - Yeah, let's go. - Yeah. - Yeah. - All right. Okay. - Come in. - Okay. - All right. - All right. So, this weekend's been kind of... I got fired on Thursday. I've only told Vanessa. I'm really sorry. I won't tell anybody. Don't worry about it. I'll probably never see you again. Oh, you don't know that. Wait. What are you doing? Come on. Last day of summer. Um... Yeah. Okay, I could do that for a few minutes. Hmm. So can I ask you something? Sure. Um, why don't you... Why don't you just go and work for your dad? "Just." It's exactly that word... "Just." I mean, even the way you asked it implies... Oh, no, no, no. I didn't mean it like that. No, it's fine, but it just implies it would somehow be easier. You're right. No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I don't want to ride my family's coattails. Theo and I are already so lucky, I... I've got to do something on my own before I... well, if I ever do go work for... Green. Yeah, I just... You know, I don't think I see anything wrong with that. Maybe not. Someday. I... I can't do this. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - No, I didn't mean to. - No, no, no, no. - That's... that's... - I shouldn't have... It's okay. I finally should just go. I should just go. Hey. Hey. So... Food service. Jesus Christ. No, I-I didn't... I didn't mean that... I mean... Yeah, I lied about what they did. Yeah. They're not, uh, professors. My dad is a janitor, and my mom works in the food-service line. - So... - Luke, I don't care. - I don't. - Right. I don't care what they do. You could have told me. Yeah, maybe I could have. It's just that, um... You have this whole fancy life with your... your job and your parents and their parties and vacations and houses, and, I mean, do you think I want a lecture from your mom about how noble it is to work in the service industry? I'm not my mom. Yeah? Did you even want me here this weekend or did you just... I don't know... invite me like some sort of buffer against your family? You just grabbed the nearest warm body. Did I do something? Don't you get it? Every day I feel like I have to be... like, good enough, clever enough, successful enough. "Oh, what do you do? What do your parents do?" "Oh, oh, we love the opera. Have we seen you in anything?" It's exhausting. Well, fuck 'em. Fuck them. Who cares what other people think? Okay, Theo, you're the last person to say that. Excuse me? You... you have this life, Theo, that is so totally just foreign to me, and, I mean, you love it. It consumes you. What whole life? You... you own a loft. You pay for everything with a platinum card. You... you put on a $75 moisturizer every morning, and then you get your hair cut by a guy that styles celebrities. Okay, last Saturday, you spent the entire afternoon picking out a $4,000 dining room table. You take cabs everywhere. Hey, that's not true. Theo, you don't even own a MetroCard. I... It's expired. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't realize my life was such... such an affront to you. Okay, Jesus, it's not an affront to me. It's just... I'm sorry. I'm gonna go inside the house. Take care. Where is everybody? Vanessa. What are you doing here in the dark? I was watching the sunset. See, it's framed by the picture window. These are beautiful. Oh, thank you. Do you know the museum wants them all? - Hmm. - Hmm. I started buying them when Theo was born. It was like each one marked a year in our life, in the lives of the boys. This one... It was the summer Roger lost his first tooth. He insisted on carrying it around all day long... this bloody little thing. It's hard to let go of things. Isn't it? I almost left Malcolm once. He was working all the time. Theo was... a year old. Malcolm never had time for us. I had awful postpartum. I felt like a '50s housewife. I was so boxed in by our life, by the bills, by everything, and this... this little creature... he wasn't... he wasn't speaking, not exactly... he was my only friend. He was the easiest baby. He was so clever. But... I didn't know how I could continue. I thought... my only friend is my one-year-old son. What did you do? I went to see a lawyer. There was no one to look after Theo, so I brought him along. And I walked out of that meeting, and I realized it wasn't his fault. So I stayed, and I got out of the house more. And then I had Roger. And I think sometimes what a terrible thing it would have been to leave. My... my whole life would have been different. Please don't tell Roger. He... his father... No one knows. No. No, of course not. 30 years ago... I could never have imagined my life turning out like this. I'm... I'm gonna go. I'm, uh... I'm gonna go dress for dinner. Mom. What are you doing? Nothing. It's just... He sings. He said he was a singer. And I... I never thought to ask him to sing. I am so stupid sometimes. I'm fine. I've got to go dress and then start dinner. Some woman told me they raised half a million dollars today. - Really? - Wow. Are you sure? Theo, can you put that in a bowl, please? Mom. I guess it doesn't matter. Hey, Mom, why aren't we eating this? There's a whole casserole in here. Roger, please don't touch that. That's for Maria. You made this? Yes. That's why we're eating leftovers. Oh. That might be Maria. Hello? Oh. Oh, that's good. Really? Well, that's wonderful. Yes, I suppose you can thank God for that. You too. You... Bye-bye. What? So? How did it go? Well, he was very lucky. His heart is beating normally again, and it sounds like he's gonna be just fine. Just fine? Yes. Hmm. I mean, one never knows anything for certain, of course. Hmm. That's good. Celia? Oh. Veronika. Hello. One of your guests left this. Let me just put this down. I-I made this casserole for Maria. Will the bears eat it if I leave it out? Well... I think I should probably put it in their kitchen. - Oh, thank you. - Mm-hmm. I'm sure you've heard. Yes. It's such a beautiful property. Marty and I, when we were first looking at houses, it was your house that caught my eye. When the realtor drove us to this area, I was so excited because I thought it was this house that was for sale. They delivered the sign yesterday. You've decided already. No, not yet. I just... I wanted to see what it looked like. Is that crazy? Why do I care what the... real estate sign looks like? I mean, really. Uh, what are you going to do with it? I don't exactly know. Hey. Hey. Didn't realize you'd gone up already. I'm still here. Look, Theo, um, this is all my own... my own stuff that I'm going through, okay? I have to figure it out on my own. It's just that most guys are total dicks, and I sort of assumed that maybe you would be one too. Well, don't worry. I can be a total dick. Well, not to me, you better not be. Okay. I'm sorry. So did you finally find out about your screenplay? Oh, uh, yeah. She said it was good. Okay, well, that's... I mean, is that good? No, it's... I don't know. What does "good" mean? Well, show it to your agent. Isn't that what really counts? Yeah. I guess so. I hope that this weekend wasn't a bad idea. Me too. Oh. Are we doing the right thing... if we give all this up? Things have always worked out for us, haven't they? Malcolm, would you say that we're good people? If you looked at us from a distance, would you say, "Those are good people. Those two are really good people"? I think someone would say that. Okay. That's good. You know something? Motherhood is a shitty deal. You change your whole life; You mold your whole personality around these little creatures. And then after 18, 20, 25 years... they leave you. They just leave you. And you become some kind of... joke, some kind of pathetic symbol of everything... they don't want in their lives. It will never be the same as when they were ten years old. People change. I don't want to change. Why do I have to change? You know what it is? I wanted to believe that it would go on forever. I never wanted to think... that it might end, and then... it just does. I know. I don't... I don't want to be alone. Celia. Hey. Look at me. Come here. Look at me. You will never, never be alone. Mm. Ever. So, you know, what do you do? I'm gonna meet with a headhunter this week. It's just everywhere I go, I see this sign that says, "Failure." You need to tell your mother. That's it? Roger... We all fail. Did you see the light outside? I-I stood there for ten minutes. I couldn't move. Hi. Do you want to help me with breakfast? Yeah. Thank you. The more I remember. But what about you? Are you going back to work after this? Mom, you know we can't do that. I just wish you could stay longer. It's just... I, uh... I keep hoping... Mom, if we don't go now, we're not gonna make our flights. I know, but I feel like you just got here. I mean, there's so much we didn't talk about. Call me. I love you. Thank you for everything. Happy to meet you all. Luke, where's your carry-on? I have it right here. You too... You guys are leaving? Got to get back to the city before traffic gets too crazy. Vanessa. So let's talk about your waters. I'd like to start carrying them in our gyms. Oh. Uh, I would love that, yeah. - Big bro. - Thank you. - Don't be a stranger, okay? - Yeah. Roger. I didn't want to tell them. Why not? They could've handled it. I don't have to share everything with my children, do I? They'll find out soon enough. I wanted their memory of this place... their last summer weekend here... I wanted it to be like every other summer we've had. It's Labor Day today. I almost forgot. That's right. I guess it's just us now. Hmm? Hmm. It seems like every story told about us Isn't meant to be Well, you fly your wings of gold All the way back home to me But what I'm thinking of Just this time Why don't you Lay your head down in my arms? In my arms Lay your head down in my arms In my arms You know, my love This was no dream of mine But the way you ride those waves Makes me want to follow you blind And what I'm thinking of Just this time Why don't you Lay your head down in my arms? In my arms Lay your head down In my arms Lay your head down in my arms In my arms Lay your head down In my arms
