And there's the metronome. This is my grandfather, Leonard Warnebring. He certainly doesn't need introducing. Oscar. My little brother. A wonder kid. He learned the violin at four, composed his first piece at twelve. And this is me. Amadeus. Tone-deaf from birth. Mind if I turn it down a bit? I'll stop his damn siren! Fucking pig! Hello. What do we know? We got an emergency call. There's a ticking in the van. A Dodge. 1986. The number plate comes from a tractor in sterdala. - Bomb squad? - On their way. - Has the Embassy received a threat? - No, nothing. Ask for silence. Silence! Ruhe bitte! Ruhe! Warnebring... Warnebring! What? It's a metronome! On the front seat. You can stop all this fuss. - You're crazy. - I knew what it was. It could have been a bomb. I know that kind of ticking all too well. We have to move on, Magnus. We have to think bigger. A real bomb is what they deserve. For you. What is it? "Music for one city and six drummers." Have you tried to play it? No. Let's just say it's rather conceptual. What the hell is all this about metronomes? Traffic police have taken over. You have better things to do than deal with drink driving cases. Back to work! This is a masterpiece! Your best work ever! You think so? It's everything we've talked about. This is our bomb! Listen to this city, contaminated by shitty music... It's time to strike back. We'll give this city a concert it'll never forget. We need four more drummers. They must be the best. Johannes Bjrk. Of course. A true poet. Go back to playing! We'll need Marcus Haraldson. Is he alive? Yes, we had a beer the other day. 10 000 volts... It was pretty rough for him. You fucking idiot! That was the last time! And I want Myran. That makes five. We need one more. Anders. He's not available. He has a steady job now. - With the philharmonic. - What? Everyone's gotta eat... even if it means whoring yourself. I hate Haydn. Thank you. You, on the kettle drums... You were too early. I was spot-on. Ok... That's what you should have been, on time. Let's take it from bar nine. Thank you. You have the time? Are you in sync with Finland? You're one hour early. How difficult can it be? Once more, bar nine. We don't sell many of these anymore. People go for digital today. It could either come from here or Schrder's. But surely they're registered? With a serial number? It's a metronome. If you don't sell many like this, you should remember... No. Nothing at all? No. Anything else? I'll just have a look around. Do you work here? No. Looking for something? A present for my brother. A musician? Actually, he's a conductor. Because that's music for congas. Let's have a look... Take this. The perfect gift for a conductor. Thanks. Thanks for the advice. Amadeus! Amadeus, darling! So lovely to see you. Hurry inside. He'll soon be here. Caught any baddies lately? Any violinists caught fiddling? Jean-Pierre... Have you met Amadeus? Oscar's brother. Nice to meet you. I didn't know Oscar had a brother. Big brother. What do you play? Amadeus is a policeman. Really... I heard Likovskij with the philharmonic orchestra. It was absolutely fantastic! Likovskij is an impostor. I quite agree. He's not original, he simply imitates others. How can you agree? Oscar's coming! What's going on here? So many people! I'm so happy to see you all here. I'm very touched. A toast to Oscar! To Oscar! Wine and nibbles are in the other room. Help yourselves! Well... Amadeus. - Nice to see you. - Likewise. Congratulations. For the concert. Yes... It's great. You're welcome, of course. I can get you a ticket. Or several, if you like. I'm not sure I'll be able to... - If I can find the time... - Of course. You must come to the concert. Your father would have been so proud. I'll try to make it. Congratulations. What's this? A present! "Funk bass for beginners." What? This is music for funk bass. I don't play funk bass, Amadeus. I'm a conductor. It must be some kind of mistake. I get it. I wouldn't know what to give a policeman! But funk bass is nice, isn't it? Let's move on to the recital, as per usual. I didn't mean to... Lucia will play first! - Hello. - Hi. It's time for the rent. But it's only the 20th. We might as well get it over with, right? - I'll talk to Magnus. - And... Apart from that... Everything else is ok? Yes. Hey... What is it you do in there? Is it porn? No, it's not porn. I'll talk to Magnus about the rent. Sanna, I can't work with these guys! They've been playing for three hours. Non-stop! There's no way of stopping them! Ok. I get the first solo. Good. Let's get started. It's good to see you all. There are... four movements. In four locations. I want it to be really clear that some things will be illegal. Some will be dangerous. But... it'll be one hell of a work of art. It's upside down. What's that? You're holding it upside down! We've lots to do. Magnus? The first step is to locate the sounds. It's vital we find a sound that'll act as a bass drum and one that'll act as a snare drum. Then there are the chords. That'll be the hardest. We'll split up. Only keep the best sounds. Be meticulous. Leave no stones unturned. We'll need a human body. Not too skinny. Not too fat. But it has to have good resonance. You can imagine how someone like me must feel in here. I feel quite out of place. Luckily, I have my fans. They worship me. Just look at all the gifts and flowers. When the doctors gave me their verdict, the decision was easy to make. My haemorrhoids had grown out of all proportion. Surgery was the only option. Let's wrap it up with some photos, shall we? We'll need a bulldozer. A diesel, 400 horsepower, minimum. It'll take place tomorrow. We'll meet up here. Keep an eye on me. Abort on my signal only. What's going on? Can't I finish my sleep before you cut me open? I am rjan Levander. Hang on, are you sure... One, two, three, four! Don't touch the patient. Don't touch the patient. Go for it, Anders! Myran! What are you doing! It's not my fault! Clear! Help! Help! Oh my God... Stop pulling our legs! Would anyone like a ticket for the Haydn concert? - My brother gave me an extra. - Christ, no! I'm busy. No thanks. I already have all his CD's. That guy's brilliant. Really. What do you mean, "all his CD's"? I have all of his CD's. The hospital called. - You know rjan Levander? - The TV guy? He's in for rectal surgery. Some sick bastards got into his room and molested him. The hospital director is a friend. The press mustn't get wind of this. Levander's threatening to sue. He's saying he's been attacked by terrorists. Help me get to the bottom of it. Hans! Hello. Thank you for coming. Hello. It's just terrible, all this. Police. I'd like to see rjan Levander? - Go ahead. - Thanks. Warnebring. From the police. Tell me what happened. - Has he lost his voice? - Sorry? You have to take them. You get the same treatment as everyone else in here! Let go! Can you... lip-read? I'd like to ask him some questions. There's Levander. I think we're looking at some kind of psychosis. They could well be... the guest scientists from the Czech Republic. Come back, Levander! Damn it, Myran! Let's get outta here! What are you doing? Let's play! Pump it up! Let's go for it! Don't touch the patient. Analyzing now. Musicians... Analyzing now. Don't touch the patient. Stop the tape! Back a bit. There! Watch where you're going! It's just terrible, all this. What on earth are you doing? Warnebring! Good grief! The perfect gift for a conductor. Hi. What are you doing here? The gift I gave you... Can I have it back? It's important. I haven't finished practicing funk bass. Please. In there, please. You are joking? No, unfortunately. Thanks. I'll try to come tonight. Bye. The first attack: "Doctor, doctor." At the hospital. The next one is: "Money 4 U, honey." What did they do to Levander? They played music on him. Music, Hagman. Levander became a rhythm instrument. "Honey." Sanchez, check up on "honey". Is it a name? A code? Check it out. Check up on "honey". I'm on it. Bees... Hagman, check "money". Threats on the Stock Market, banks, anywhere to do with money. Can you run this for fingerprints? But be discreet and only give the results to me, in person. How does this sound to you? It sounds like you're knocking. Really? Yes. They played on this. And now I can't hear it. Is this some kind of hearing test? Why the hell did you do that? I turn up with one of my best policemen and it turns out that this brilliant policeman proves to be a baboon. A baboon banging metal trays on the hospital's bloody walls! Levander's attackers are musicians. And they will strike again. Oh, really? This is a concert program. There are four different movements. "Money 4 U, honey" "Fuck the music!" "Electric Love" "Fuck the music..." Carry on. I'm on it. Ok. Try not to kill anyone this time. Let's do it. This is a gig! Everybody keep calm! Move! We don't want to hurt anyone! We're only here for the music! You are our audience! Sit down! Listen. And nobody will get hurt! Three minutes! One, two, three, four! There are 24 beekeepers in the region. One of them is even a musician. He plays the oboe. Warnebring. The bank alarm's gone off. A hold-up. Damn seatbelt! Why do I always get to sit on this side? Were they wearing masks? Yes, black balaclavas. Sanchez, can I have silence? Silence! Shush! Yes, it's them. There's a metronome here somewhere. Find it. I got a match from one of the prints. Her name is Sanna Persson. She's done time for vandalism. She flooded the music academy. She went to the academy? Yes and no. She was expelled. She's pretty cute. You have an address? Just a PO Box. That's all. Where did you get this sheet music? Yes? Excuse me, my name is Warnebring. I'm from the police. To what do I owe such an honour, Inspector? Someone's been playing in the wrong key? Any violinists caught fiddling? Musicians' jokes. It concerns one of your students: Sanna Persson. Persson. My office should've been renovated a year ago. She tortured us with her ideas. She created music with paperweights, horse droppings and God knows what else. Then she became obsessed with water. Water, water, water. My God! She was a disgrace to this establishment! You still have any of her work? Not much. The police went through it during the investigation. I'll ask my secretary to help you. It was a sad year. Two students expelled the same term. It took us a long time to build our reputation back up, believe me, Inspector. Here's the yearbook. Wait... Are you related to Oscar Warnebring, by any chance? He's my brother. I knew it! You must be very proud of him. I was his music history teacher. Tell him old Backman says hello. You don't play an instrument yourself? No. The arts... You need talent, discipline and determination. Not everyone has what it takes. I really dislike music. Here it is. Sanna Persson's water concert. Who else was expelled? Myhr. His name was Fredrik Myhr. Myhr was kicked out after a couple of months. It came as no surprise. He crushed his piano teacher's fingers! He became furious and slammed the lid shut. Down on his fingers! Bang! A pianist's fingers! Doesn't Myran want his noodles? He's gone out. I'm looking for Fredrik Myhr. Who the hell are you? Police. I'm looking for Sanna Persson. What? I'm looking for Sanna Persson. What are you talking about? You studied at the music academy together... Stop! I need to talk to you! Stop playing! Hey, honey! You're getting all wet! But you seem to like that... We could go to my place and sort out the rent. Come on. Fucking hell! This is... What's in your ears? - Sorry? - Your ears! This is Amadeus Warnebring, head of our antiterrorist unit. Nice to meet you. The pleasure's mine. Did you know he's Oscar Warnebring's elder brother? - Congratulations. - It must have been fantastic, growing up with a world-famous conductor. Yes, it was... unusual. Tonight, we're all going to enjoy ourselves. You too, Warnebring! That's an order! - May I? - Of course. To your seat? I'd love that. Amadeus, darling! How lovely to see you! Good evening. I never thought I'd see you here! Amadeus? What's the matter? I'll be right back. Excuse me. No! A bomb? A bomb! Watch out! Here I am, at my mother's grand piano. It was... the last time I sat there before mum and dad gave up. But I never wanted to play. All I wanted was silence. I dreamt of music made of silence. I've brought... some dry clothes. Thanks. Are - you - ok? Wait! I want this. Look, Myran's on TV. The police are still looking for the musician Fredrik Myhr. Myhr is a suspect in tonight's attack on the Opera, during which Emil st's statue, "Boy with a Horn", was completely destroyed. The chief superintendent and the head of the antiterrorist unit say the police are doing everything to catch the terrorists and that they already have several leads. This is a metronome. He's really lost it. Knock it off! And you get a grip, Myran! You could've killed him! He came to my place. What? Your place? - Why didn't you tell us? - Because it's cool. It's not! You're wanted by the police. You're the one he came looking for. So why aren't you on TV? They won't get away with this! We're going to rid this city of musical scum! Police! Drop that drum! Police! Drop your instruments! Stay calm! What have we done? Open the trunk, sir. I don't have any drums, I promise. Open the trunk. See? Help! Are you ok? - Am I audible? - What? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. That workman says a crazy Finn stole his keys. A certain Anders Vestergrd. We've found fingerprints from a Sanna Persson. Warnebring! I want a full rundown! What? Sorry? Are you alright? Are you feeling ok? Damn musicians! I want silence! I want silence! You bloody musicians! I just want silence. Don't you get it, you bloody musicians? Just silence. Shut up, you wanker! Don't talk to my boss that way! You're silent. You're not audible. They've played on you. You might as well shut up. I can't hear you. Open the door! "Electric love"... Oscar! Open up! What the hell's going on? - God, look at you! - How are you feeling? Be quiet! You'll wake Lucia. I've got to write music. I need your help. You are tone-deaf, Amadeus. I know, but... Go home and sleep. We'll talk later. Christ! I have to write music! - Be quiet, for Christ's sake! - Come on, let's go. Quiet! First of all, there's the quarter note... It's worth one beat in time. Wait, you don't have to play. Carry on. Then, there's the half note... It lasts two beats. One, two... Ok. Wait. Which one's which? Look! Quarter note. Half note. Good. That's all I need. - What? But... - Move over. But there are other notes, other things you need to know. Such as keys and time signatures... This is perfect. What do you think? But it's hardly anything! But is it music? It's got to be music or it won't work. It's very bad music. But it is music? Good. Thanks. This music will change the world. You're not the first to say that. Anders, back a bit. - Forward a touch. - Ready. Ready! One, two, three, four! Bravo. Him again? Bravo! Who's the composer? Is it... the gentleman with the stylish glasses? Maybe. Thanks for the concert. Thanks, all of you. It really was a great musical experience! I really mean it. What the hell do you want? What do I want? I've written music for you. Sanna! I'll need your help. Can you come down? Why don't you come up here, you fascist pig? No. We'll play my opus together. You four up there, me and Sanna down here. If not, it won't work. I'll take care of this. - I'll go. - No! Yes! I'll talk to him. Listen up, orchestra. Here's a metronome. Be careful, it was my father's. You'll play my music exactly as it's written. But don't forget, the electricity has to be switched on this time. Fuck off! Fucking pig! What are you doing? Sanna... I'm sorry. I'm gonna drum you to death, you fucking pig! Play my music and I'll let Sanna go. Turn the power on in exactly 20 minutes. And we will change the world! Let go of me! What the hell are we doing here? You'll see. Ok, I'm taking these off. I trusted you! Sanna! Wait! I need you! I need you! You're the only one who can help me... who can play this piece. I wrote this music. For you. Here. You're the soloist. I'll understand... if you don't want to, but... You wrote this? Yes. What the hell is this? Bloody sadist! Are you sure about this? I think it'll be ok. But... make sure you don't touch each other. Next time, think twice before choosing your instruments. Ok. Let's go for it. Ok, you damn cop. This one's for you! One, two... three, four! It's started. My God, this sucks! It's the worst thing I've ever played in my life! Come on. Hurry up! Here comes the grand finale... And now... silence. Silence at last. No more music. You must leave. They know who you are, they know everything. Leave and go far away. Go now. This is so beneath us! We've got to make a living somehow. Music's all they know.
