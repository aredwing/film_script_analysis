Perfect day to cruise around the city... ...with your head hanging out of the car window. Perfect day to chase that annoying postman. Perfect day to mark that special fire hydrant. Perfect, that is, for everyone that's not about to lose their best friend. Hey, boy. See, today is the day Maya Dolittle starts getting ready to go off to college. It's a dog's worst nightmare... ...but this dog is not just gonna roll over and take it lying down. Oh, no. Oh, here we go. It' s just so weird. I keep trying to pack, but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. Yeah, weird. Can you believe it, Lucky?. Just two more weeks and I will officially be a student at vet school. I can't wait to start working with animals. It's so exciting. Yeah, exciting. Oh, Luck, I'm sorry. Dogs aren't allowed in the dorms. You see, that's what makes no sense. It's vet school. You'd think they'd want animals there, right?. I know. It's okay. -What is he saying?. -Oh, we're just talking about college. Well, I just came in to tell you... ...your orientation DVD from San Francisco University has just arrived. It did?. Let's go watch it. Come on. In tonight's Hollywood Dish, L.A. party girl Tiffany Monaco... ...has found herself in the middle of yet another celebrity feud... ... this time with former friend Dasha Pringle. Monkey was watching that. People. No respect for their ancestors. -You ready?. -Yeah. Congratulations on your admittance... ...to San Francisco University's pre-veterinary medicine program. I would like to take this opportunity to give you a quick overview. Years one and two comprise your foundational studies... ... what you would call your sciences, your math. I have to go through two whole years before I can start working with animals. -That's ridiculous. -I guess that's just their program, honey. Year three is your first year of veterinary study. Okay, here we go, here we go. San Francisco University has state-of-the-art software... ...detailing the anatomy of over 2000 species. Wait, software?. We' ve gotta be getting to the real animals soon, right?. -I don't know. -During year four... ...you'll be working with anatomical models. -Models?. This has to be a joke. -Oh, you mean Iike you going away. Years five and six will send you back to the books. Back to the books?. And then you're ready to enter the real world... ...with a 1 0-month residency program. What?. T en more months?. But once you 've successfully completed that... ...congratulations, you 'll finally be a licensed veterinarian. See you in the fall. I can ' t believe this. That's Iike almost seven years from now. In seven years, I ' II be 25. Yeah, and I ' II be.... I can ' t even woof that high. Man, dog years are depressing. Twenty-five years old. My Iife will basically be over by then. I just wanna help animals. Do I really have to wait seven years to do it?. Maya, caring for animals is a big responsibility. There is so much to Iearn. It's gonna take some time. But, Mom, I can talk to animals. I don't need to Iearn all that stuff. They can just tell me what's wrong and I can help them. Monkey, is there anything wrong that you'd Iike me to help you with?. Well, I am slightly bothered by the term monkey. From now on, I would prefer to be referred to as a primate-American. Okay, bad example, but-- Maya, there is a Iot more to helping animals... ...than just being able to talk to them. If you really wanna help, becoming a veterinarian is the best way. But Mom, it's just a Iong time to wait. My Iatest masterpiece. Actually, there is a way that you can help animals right now. How?. You can help by taking your dog for a walk. Now, I'II bark to that. It's just ridiculous, Lucky. I'm different. I shouldn't have to do what everybody else does. I agree. You should just skip school altogether and stay here with me. I'm sure there are plenty of animals you could help right here on this very street. -Lucky. -Talk about a coincidence. Come on. Hang on. Hey, Iittle guy. How are you, huh?. -He's been up there a while. -Come on, come on now. Come here. Cat stuck in a tree. Defect of the species, really. Ma'am, is that your cat up there?. Oh, yes. Mr. Sillywillykins just won't come down. Mr. Sillywillykins?. Man, being stuck in a tree is the Ieast of that dude's problems. Oh, I just hope that fireman is able to bring him down. Come on. Come on, boy. That's not a cat, that's a mountain Iion. I knew it. Mr. Sillywillykins is too much for them. He has the reflexes of a cat, you know. Mckible here. Yeah, we're gonna need some help. -It's a real claw job. -Okay, ma'am. Don't worry about your kitty. He will be just fine. -I'm gonna go see if I can do anything. -Okay, right away. -AII right. Thanks. -Excuse me, sir. -Can I help at all?. -Yes, you can help by keeping back. -You get assistance? -Just some girl who thinks she can help. Hey there, Iittle guy. Why won't you come down?. What's going on?. -What?. -It's okay, I can understand you. I'm a Dolittle. A Dolittle?. Oh, right. I heard about your family. Good people. Oh, thanks. So, what's going on?. I refuse to Iive with that woman for one more second. Why not?. What's wrong with her?. Come over tomorrow night around bath time and you can see for yourself. Wait, but you're a cat. You're not supposed to bathe a cat. Exactly. We self-groom. I mean, hasn't she ever wondered what we're doing when we do this?. If she wants to bathe anyone, she should start by bathing herself. Talk about old-Iady smell. Gag me with a fur ball. Excuse me. What's going on here?. Oh, that nice young Iady is helping my kitty down from that tree. What?. Hey. She can't be up there. You can't be up there. Come down now. Look at that. It's almost Iike they're having a conversation. Thanks. Come on, come on, come on. Okay, well, if she agrees to never bathe you again-- And start bathing herself. --and to start bathing herself, will you come down?. It's okay. That is over. Thank you so much. I missed you so much. This Iittle kitty's nine Iives are still intact... ...thanks to 1 7-year-old Maya Dolittle... ...daughter of world-renowned animal communicator Dr. John Dolittle. Like her father, the younger Dolittle... ...actually talked the cat down from the tree. I guess you could say the cat didn 't get her tongue. I can't believe I made the news. It is very exciting. My MySpace page is going crazy. You see, this is what I wanna do with my Iife. I didn't have to go through years of school to help that cat down. Yeah, I'm with you. There's gotta be some way I can start helping animals now. Who could that be?. Okay, so get this. It's a reality show about me doing a reality show. So it's gonna be, Iike, twice as real. I can't wait to read the script. Excuse me. Can I help you?. But what I'm really excited about is my new perfume. -Excuse me-- -Couldn't believe it. It was so hard figuring out what I wanted it to smell Iike. Did you know that there are dozens of different smells?. -Can't believe it. -Oh, my gosh. That's Tiffany Monaco. Lucky, do you know who that is?. That is the heiress' heiress. Heiress' heiress?. What's she heiress of?. Of being an heiress. Her mom was an heiress who married an heir. She's one of the hottest celebrities out there. I read her exclusive interview. Her favorite color is pink. -You're Maya, right?. -Right. Sweet. Let's motor. Wait. What are you talking about?. What am I talking about?. -You are coming to L.A. with me. -Los Angeles?. Why?. Because I saw you on TV. You are the girl who can talk to animals, right?. So you gotta come with me, talk to Princess. Who's Princess?. Princess, you know, my Iittle dog. She has been totally depressed Iately. She wouldn't come with me to San Fran for our spring shopping trip. There's this awesome boutique that sells high heels for dogs. It's called Best in Shoe. So obviously, she's totally messed, right?. And I need you to talk to her. So wait, you're saying your pet needs help and you think I can help her?. Yeah. Can you stay right here for one minute for me, please?. Where?. Absolutely not. Come on, Mom, please. I really wanna do this. Maya, we are Ieaving in two weeks to take you to college. We have way too much to do before then. And with your father in China working with the pandas for a month... ...it is all up to you and me. We'II get it done. Don't worry. -Maya. -Mom, come on. You've seen the orientation video. I won't be able to help another animal for seven years. PIease, just Iet me help this one now. Maya, try the puppy dog eyes. She's a sucker for those. Come on, with me. In three, two, one, and.... PIease. Now, call me as soon as you arrive and call me again an hour after that. -As a matter of fact, call me every hour. -Okay, Mom. You will have her back tomorrow morning, right?. I have my own jet. Mom, don't worry. Everything will be fine, I promise. -Okay. -AII right. More time with Maya. I get the window seat. Finally, the break I've been waiting for. Hollywood, here I come. Maya, remember, I'II be waiting for your call, honey. I won't forget. I'II call you when I Iand. I sure hope Maya packed some snacks in here. Monkey Ioves the cheesy puffs. Bye. Star maps. Miss Monaco. Get out of here. Wow, what is this place?. A movie studio?. Oh, no. This is my house. Here we are, my Iittle pied-a-terre. Oh, my gosh. Come on. Princess' room is up here, I think. This house is so big I never know where I'm going. Her room?. The dog has her own room?. Oh, boy, Maya, you are really gonna regret bringing me on this trip, huh?. That's the Iast time I fly coach. There's never enough tail room. And now, Monkey is ready for his close-up. There she is. There's my precious Iittle girl. Hey, how much is that doggy in the window?. There's my Iittle boobsie-woobsie. This is the girl Mommy told you about. You tell her what's bothering you and she'II make you feel all better. Okay, baby-waby?. AII right, Iet's see you work your magic. Okay. Hey, Princess. I'm Maya. You wanna tell me what's going on?. Why don't you wanna Ieave your room?. Why?. Why?. Because I'm a guy, that's why. A frigging guy. A guy. Hey, I don't bark both ways. Look at me. Doesn't that crazy broad realize how humiliating this getup is?. Do you have any idea how much poop I take on the street from other dogs?. It's enough to make a dog wanna put himself to sleep. I can't believe this. I'm actually watching someone talk to an animal. -Oh, really?. -Oh, my God. -No way. -This could be huge. But wait, I don't understand. How could she not have noticed?. Hasn't she ever seen you go potty?. She doesn't take me to go potty. No, she's got a whole staff for that. The only time when she even holds me is when there are cameras around. And then I wind up dressed up Iike this. Okay, okay. Well, just calm down. I'II just tell her, okay?. So Tiffany, I don't know how to tell you this... ...but your Princess is a prince. She is?. I mean, he is?. He's, Iike, totally gonna need a new outfit. Thanks to everyone for coming to my Iittle baby's coming-out party. So I have an announcement to make. The dog formerly known as Princess... ...will now be known as Rocco. Hey, make sure to get my good side. Actually, every side is my good side, huh?. Hey, thanks for your help, Maya. No problem, Rocco. Yo, Iike my shades?. Lucky, I'm over here. What's that?. Oh, sorry. You should really take those things off. You can't even see anything. What?. Oh, no, not a thing. But Hollywood parties aren't about seeing. They're about being seen. I didn't really pack to be seen. Not that I own anything to be seen in at this party. Hey, come on. What's important is we're together in Hollywood. Hey, I Iove this song. Come on, Iet's dance. Go. Go. Go. Hey, watch it, bozo. Oh, my God. Lucky. I'm so sorry. Hey, it's okay, really. But you might wanna consider getting your dog a seeing-eye dog. Oh, no, no, he's not blind. He's.... You were joking, weren't you?. -Trying to. -Oh, no, no, no. It was really, really funny. I'm sorry. I'm just a Iittle out of my element here. I've never been to a party Iike this. I've never been anywhere Iike this before. You know what?. I'm sorry.

You know, I'm not the kind of guy who spends all his time chasing tail. I'm Iooking for something meaningful. I'm a dog, but I'm not a dog, you know. So twins, huh?. Wow, I bet you two were the pick of the Iitter. I remember this episode where you and your family got together... ...formed a band and entered a talent contest. -You were so good. -You remember that episode?. -Yeah. -Well, thanks. Thanks a Iot.

So, what have you got?. You ever heard of Dr. Dolittle?. Heard of him?. I tried to sign him. I thought I could make that guy a superstar... ...but he was more interested in helping animals. Like there's any money in that. Well, what if I told you I knew his daughter?. His daughter?. So?. So?. She can talk to animals too. Really?. And the best part?. She's right over there.

Yeah, it actually does, Iike seven years. Seven years. What a Iong time to waste. I mean, wait. Or you could do this TV show... ...and start helping those poor Iittle animals right now. Yes, Lucky, this is the answer I've been Iooking for. The answer?. Wait a minute, so if you did this TV show... ...then you wouldn't go away to college?. Nope, wouldn't have to. I Iove it. The Animal Talkers. It's brilliant. Thank you, Lucky, for always Iooking out for what's best for me. What's best for you?. Oh, yes, exactly. I mean, who else would I be thinking of?.

Well, I don't know yet, but you can trust me. I usually make pretty good decisions, don't I?. Okay, stay a few more days, help some more animals. I guess I can finish up this packing myself. And as Iong as you're back by Saturday, we should be in good shape. Okay, all right. Thank you, Mommy. -Have fun. -I Iove you, bye. Yes. I had my chef prepare a special breakfast... ...to celebrate the first day of your new Iife. Have I died and gone to doggie heaven or what?. Eat up, enjoy, then we've got to motor. Rick wants to pitch our show to the networks, so we're already behind. Don't worry, I started thinking about what the show should be Iike. I think I want it to be, Iike, educational, you know?. We could answer viewers' questions and we could go into the audience and-- That reminds me, we need guests. We could go on the Internet-- Okay, pause. We are way ahead of you on that. Rick's set up a bunch of appointments with possible celebrity guests. -Wait, celebrity guests?. -Totally. You think anyone's gonna watch if we interview regular people's animals?. -I don't think so. -Really?. Smells Iike fish eggs. Oh, well. --but I don't want it to all be about that. Right, right.

Okay, but you're a pig. Aren't you supposed to be fat?. Says who?. Why does the word pig always have to be associated with being fat?. Well, I ain't gonna be part of the problem no more. Well, I applaud you for what you're trying to do... ...but you can't just not eat. It's not healthy. What else can I do?. I have a slow metabolism. Well, I really don't know what to tell you. I-- You know what?. I think I have an idea. Oh, thank you, Maya. I can feel the pounds just dropping off already. Bikini season, here I come. You shouldn't have any trouble with getting her to eat now... ...but you should also consider a Iow-calorie diet. Wow, I don't know what to say, but I'II see you at the taping... ...of your new show. Right, Chubster?. You got it, Chad baby. You nailed it. You really nailed it. -I did?. -Totally. You know, I think you and I make a really great team. I think we do.

Two days ago, I was sitting in my bedroom packing to go to college. And now I'm in Los Angeles... ...hanging out with celebrities and putting together my own TV show. Oh, not to mention going to dinner with Brandon Booker himself. That's right, that's right. -You won't tell me where we're going. -Will you trust me?. You're gonna Iove this place where I got reservations. Best view in town. I think they used to shoot episodes of Lassie up here. Lassie. Now, there was a beautiful animal. -Think she ever had any work done?. -I don't know. -Maybe a Iittle Collie-gen. -Good one. So, what about school?. What did you tell your parents?. Well, I haven't exactly told them yet. -You haven't told them?. -No. I'II just wait to tell her until things are final. We go see the network tomorrow, see if they wanna put the show on. Really?. Good Iuck. Okay, we're almost there. It's just up ahead. I don't understand where in the world you would have reservations up here. Trust me. It is-- Amazing. Brandon, this is absolutely amazing. I told you it was the best view in town. You can see everything from here. Now you really can, Iook. That's the big record building over there. This is really something else. Remember that cool theater we drove by?. You see it right there?. You see it?. -Hollywood Walk of Fame. -Yeah, that's the bowling alley. You can see the ocean. Oh, my God. Wow, your owner is a real class act. He's starting to smell better and better to me. So hungry?. Well, I haven't really had much of an appetite recently. Oh, no?. No, I don't know what's wrong with me. I've just been feeling a Iittle off the past few days. I'm really tired too. Oh, hey, hang on a second. Hey, Maya, Emmy said she's feeling a Iittle strange... ...really tired, doesn't wanna eat and stuff. Any ideas?. Is he talking to you right now?. Actually, he is. He said Emmy's feeling a Iittle weird. She is?. Yeah, but don't worry. I'm sure I can help her. So you're feeling a Iittle tired and you don't wanna eat. Well, maybe a change of diet can have a positive effect. Well, I met this pig today who has a big problem with food. So, what do you think, girl?. Maybe a Iittle variety might help?. Sure, okay. I'm willing to give it a try. There are some extra dumplings in the basket. -Why don't you try those?. -Thanks, Maya. Oh, you're welcome, girl. Don't worry, everything will be okay. What?. Nothing. It's just that the view's not the only thing up here that's amazing. Here you go. Dig in to these. You got some sauce on your nose. -I did?. Where?. -Here. I'II get it. I knew being sloppy would pay off someday, but.... Add to that appearances by one Chad Cassidy... ...not to mention hip-hop superstar Ridiculuz... ...on top of all the other celebrities we have already discussed... ...and, Iadies and gentlemen, I think-- No, I know that you have found your next big show. I think... ...we Iove it. -You do?. -More than Iove it. "Love" Iove it. That's a Iot of Iove. We think this show can be big. No, bigger than big. Huge. Hugely big. In fact, we have a hole in our fall schedule... ...I think we could fill with this show. Tiff, I can't believe it. I'm gonna be on TV. I can start helping animals right now. Absolutely. There are, however, a few small changes we'd Iike to discuss first. Small changes?. Oh, smaller than small. -Itsy-bitsy. -Teeny-weeny. Okay, Iike what?. Well, for starters, we'd Iike to tone down the whole helping thing. Tone down?. But that's what this show is all about. Oh, absolutely. We just think the show can be more entertaining... ...while it's helping. But it has to help. I swear, if this show doesn't help, I don't know what we're doing here. Any of us. Oh, okay, well, I can understand that. More entertaining. Anything else?. We can iron out all the finer details Iater. Right now, the big question is do we have a deal?. Maya Dolittle... ...welcome to network television. -Yes. -Congratulations, kiddo, you did it. Oh, thanks, guys, but, Iook, I still have one concern. I know the show has to be entertaining, but I wanna make sure... ...the purpose of what we're doing is to still help animals. Let me ask you. -You are Maya Dolittle, correct?. -Of course I am. Maya Dolittle wants to help animals, right?. That's all I've ever wanted to do. If Maya Dolittle is involved in this show... ...then how can it not be about helping animals?. Maya Dolittle helps animals. That's what she does. Yeah, yeah, I guess that makes sense. Of course it does. Now, Iook, I don't want you to worry about any of this stuff, okay?. I will not Iet anyone ruin your vision for this show. -Okay, kiddo?. -Okay. Because I'm Rick Beverly. See?. That's what I do. Now, there is just one small detail Ieft to discuss. Not a big one, just a small one. -And what's that?. -That's my contract. -The contract?. -It's nothing out of the ordinary. It just gives me permission to represent you... ...and to use your Iikeness, etcetera, etcetera. There's a bunch of Iegal hoo-hah... ...that you don't have to concern yourself with at all. Tiff signed the exact same thing when we started working together. -Isn't that right, Tiff?. -Yeah, that's right. Yeah, fun. You know what?. I think I should read it before I sign it. Is that okay?. Absolutely. Absolutely, you should read it before you sign it. I wouldn't have it any other way. Wouldn't be right. We can worry about all this stuff Iater. Maya and I have something more important we've to do first. -Like what?. -Celebrate. And there's only one way I know how to do that. Monkeys, we never go out of style. Wow, celebrating is so much fun. Now that you're gonna stay out here, we can do it, Iike, every weekend. Really?. Wow, that would be so great. But, you know, you've already done so much for me already. I don't wanna impose more than I already have. Besides, you probably wanna get back to hanging out with your regular friends. Yeah, you are so right. Because I usually hang out with them, Iike, every day. I wish they wouldn't wanna hang out so much, but you know friends. They're just so friendly. Sorry, I have to get this. Don't use up all the sun. Bring me back one of those fancy drinks. The ones with the Iittle umbrellas in them. -Hello?. -Friends, good one. -What did you say?. -I said that was a good one. About Tiffany having friends. What do you mean?. I mean, she doesn't. Wait, what are you talking about?. Who do I see her all the time in the magazines with?. She's always hanging out with all kinds of fabulous people. Photo ops staged for the cameras. She doesn't really know any of those people. It's kind of sad if you think about it. Yeah. Sorry, that was Britney. She wanted to hang out, but I told her I couldn't... ...because I was hanging out with my new best friend. -Poor kid. -Hi, baby. I hope it isn't who I think it is. Okay, people, the audience will be here in Iess than three hours... ...so Iet's get cracking on our first rehearsal. Look at you. You Iook dynamite. Now, all the celebrity pets have arrived. You all ready for rehearsal?. -Yep. -Totally. Great, then there's just one thing to talk about. The contract. Did you get a chance to Iook at it?. Oh, no, I completely forgot. We've just been so busy. -Oh, boy. -Anyone seen my frappe?. -Maya, you Iook great. -This could be a problem. Because before the cameras roll, we need your name on the dotted Iine. But if you need a few more days to read it, I guess that's okay. I'II just send all these people home. -Oh, no. -I'm gonna be on TV. I'd sign it now, but I didn't bring it with me. Oh, what a coincidence. I have an extra one right here. Okay, well, if Tiffany signed the exact same thing... ...it should be fine, right?. -Right. -Okay. There you go. Super. Now Iet's Dolittle it. You Iike that?. I thought that could be your new catch phrase. It's in the contract. Oh, wait. -Oh, no, it's my mom. -Oh, great. I guess I have to tell her what I've been doing. -Yeah. -I'II be up in a minute. Okay, good stuff. -Hello?. -Hey, Maya. -Hey, Mom. -Break a shell. Oh, no, no, I haven't gotten any of your messages. Maya, what is going on?. You were supposed to be home yesterday. Look, Mom, I have to tell you something... ...and I really need you to try to understand, okay?. I've decided not to go to college, stay in Los Angeles... ...and do a TV show with Tiffany Monaco. You're what? Maya, I don't know what has come over you... ...but we will talk about it Iater when you get home. Now, what you're going to do is pack your bags... ...and get to the airport tonight. I will have a ticket waiting for you. Do you understand me? Look, Mom, I already made up my mind... ...so you ' re just gonna have to accept it. I gotta go. They're waiting for me in rehearsal. I'll give you a call later. Rehearsal?. Maya, don't you dare hang up that phone, young Iady. I'm your mother, we'll-- Maya?. Maya?. That didn't sound Iike it went really well. You can say that... ...but she'II understand when she sees the show, right?. I mean, once she sees how much good the show is gonna do, right?. -Won't she?. -Sure, sure she will. Yeah, of course. Don't give it a second thought. Thanks, Lucky. Now go out there and break a Ieg. Rehearsal's up. And action. Hi, I'm Tiffany Monaco, and this is my friend-- Maya Dolittle. And we would Iike to welcome you to.... -The Animal Talkers. -The Animal Talkers. Today, we're gonna talk about animal fashion. -Isn't that right, Maya?. -It sure is. And our first episode is all about how to help our animals Iook good. It's going to be such an amazing show. We have Hollywood heartthrob Chad Cassidy. Hey, Emmy. I'm psyched you guys could make it. -You want a tour of the studio?. -Sure, Lucky, thanks. But first, can I get a drink of water?. Oh, you're still not feeling well, are you?. Come on, I know a place backstage where you can relax. Tiff, our first guest is not only one of the biggest Hollywood heartthrobs... ...but he also has one of the biggest Hollywood hearts. So Iet's give a big warm Animal Talkers welcome... ...to Chad Cassidy. And his VIP-- Very Important Pig, that is. --Chubster. Chubster told Maya when she's getting ready to paint the town red... ...with owner Chad Cassidy, she Iikes to think pink. That's right, Tiffany. And thanks to you and Maya, we'II never clash again. Isn't that right, Chubster?. What is this, a fashion show?. Now I think it's time for us to bring out our next guest... ...who happens to be one of my favorites. Hey, yo. We're happy to be here, y'all. Hey, Maya, who's that hip-hopper?. Girl, that is Ridiculuz and his hare with flair, Mr. FIuffernufferman. We helped him find his inner mack daddy with this hot ensemble. How do you Iike your new duds, Mr. FIuffernufferman?. Really?. Good one. That was really funny. Cut. That was amazing. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Take five, we're gonna reset for the next rehearsal segment. Thank you, people. AII right, Iet's go. Roger, how was that?. -Hey. -Hey. So, what do you think?. Well, I think I barely recognize you. No, not me, I'm talking about the show. What do you think?. The show?. Yeah, well, the show is interesting. Interesting?. -Don't you Iike it?. -Oh, I don't know. I guess-- I mean, it wasn't what I expected. I thought you wanted the show to be about helping animals. Well, I did. I do. -I mean, it is, isn't it?. -Yeah, well, I don't know. A pig in a tutu?. How does that really help anyone?. It's just a different kind of help, you know?. -It still has to be entertaining, right?. -Yeah. I guess I'm just a Iittle surprised. When you first told me about the show... ...I pictured something a Iittle more educational. Maya, Maya. Wait, Lucky, hold on one second. I know the show has changed a bit from when I first heard about it... ...but it's still all about helping animals. -Maya. -I mean, I'm Maya Dolittle. And all I wanna do is help animals. So why would I be on a show that isn't about helping animals?. Maya, Maya, I really need to talk to you. Lucky, I said hold on a minute. Maya, are you sure this is what you wanna be doing?. Maya, Iisten to me. Emmy needs help. Lucky, I said hold-- Wait, what did you say?. I think Emmy is really sick. -You better come take a Iook at her. -Oh, no. What's the matter?. Where you going?. Well, Lucky said there's something wrong with Emmy. -Emmy?. -Yeah, come on. Maya?. Where are you going, Maya?. Maya, we need you on-set. -Lucky, come on, where is she?. -Over here, hurry. Emmy. -Oh, Emmy. -Emmy. What's the matter, girl?. Tell me what's wrong. I don't know. I just keep feeling worse and worse. -Is she okay?. What's the matter?. -I'm not sure yet. Maya Dolittle to the set. Maya Dolittle to the set, please. Okay, I think I better get her to a vet. No, no, no. I can help her. Emmy, can you tell me, where does it hurt?. I don't know. -I just feel so weak. -What did she say?. -She's not sure, but it's okay-- -No, I'm taking her to a vet. But you don't have to, I can talk to her-- Maya, just because you can talk to animals... ...doesn't mean you know everything about them. Now, are you gonna help me get her to a vet or not?. Maya, what's going on?. We need you right now. Maya, we gotta do something. We better hurry. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Come on, baby. Hey, where are you going?. -I'm sorry. -Sorry?. I got a show to shoot. I'm sorry?. I'm sorry?. Excuse me. Excuse me. I think my dog is really sick. Okay, Iet's bring her right through. It's okay, Emmy. It's okay. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you to wait outside. PIease just Iet her be okay. Come on, come on. What is taking so Iong?. She's gonna be okay. -She is?. -Yeah. Oh, that is such a relief. What's wrong with her?. It's Bordetella. It's actually fairly easy to diagnose. The symptoms are quickly identifiable. Fatigue, Ioss of appetite. Fatigue and Ioss of appetite. The test confirmed it. Most dogs are vaccinated for it when they're puppies... ...but for some reason, she wasn't. The people that I adopted her from told me that she had all her shots. I guess I should have checked. It's Iucky that you caught it when you did and brought her in. Yeah, it's Iucky we caught it in time. Emmy, I'm so sorry I couldn't figure out what was wrong with you. It's okay, Maya. It's not your fault. How could you have known?. We're gonna keep her for observation. -She needs some rest. -Yeah. They said that she could have died. And it would have been my fault. No, Brandon, it would have been mine, and I'm so sorry. Look, I'II talk to you about this Iater, okay?. Right now, there's something I gotta do. And I'm happy that Emmy's gonna be okay. Yeah. I just-- I don't-- Where is she?. Where is she?. -If your client doesn't show-- -Just relax. Finally. Okay, people, Maya's here. We're set to go. PIaces, please. Maya, are you okay?. How's Brandon's dog?. I think she's gonna be okay. Good. Are you okay?. Maya, where have you been all day?. You completely missed rehearsal. I know, and I'm really sorry, but I have something to tell you guys. We don't have time for that. We're about to start taping. No, Rick, I really need to talk to you. Later. Right now, you've gotta Iisten, okay?. I'm Iooking for my daughter. Can you tell me where I can find Maya Dolittle?. Because you missed rehearsal, you have to go out there cold. Follow the cue cards and you'II be fine. No, but Rick-- Tiffany's a pro. Just follow her Iead, okay?. -No, but-- -AII right, knock them dead, kiddo. Hi, Tiffany. Come on, girl. AII right. Talk to some animals. -Hurray, Maya. -Maya, you rock. We're all gonna be on TV. Hi, I'm Tiffany Monaco, and this is my friend.... I said, this is my friend-- Oh, Maya. Maya Dolittle. That's right. -And we are the animal talkers. -The animal talkers. What she said. Today, we're gonna talk all about animal fashion. Isn't that right, Maya?. What's wrong with her?. Right, Maya?. Read what's on the cue cards, honey. No. No. That's not what I wanna talk about. I wanna talk about the fact that... ...this is all wrong. A dog I know almost died today and it was my fault. I thought I could help her. I thought I did help her... ...but it turns out I was just fooling myself. You guys, Maya Dolittle, the animal talker... ...can't even help animals... ...because Maya Dolittle doesn't even know how to. Or at Ieast not yet. -But Maya helped me. -Me too. -She certainly helped this dove. -She helped all of us. Guys, Iisten to her. Yeah. It's not what she's saying. I may have helped a few celebrity pets with their problems... ...but I wanna do so much more. Just because I can talk to animals doesn't mean I can help them. Like, really help them when they need it the most. And in order to do that, I need to go to veterinary school. So I'm really sorry, Tiffany. And I'm sorry to everybody in the audience... ...but I just can't do this show. I hope you all understand. Great stuff. Really great stuff. Maya, can I just have one quick word with you backstage?. Yeah, sure. That is such a relief. Rick, thank you so much for understanding. Understanding?. The only thing I understand is that as Iong as I have this... ...you will do exactly what I want you to do... ...when I want you to do it. -What?. -Don't you get it?. Thanks to your signature being on this contract, I own you. I own your name. I own your Iittle face. I own all things Maya Dolittle. Just Iike I own Tiffany Monaco. Remember?. She signed the exact same contract. You knew the contract said that and you didn't say anything to me?. I thought we were friends. -Well, I-- -Oh, yeah, friends. Welcome to Hollywood. So now... ...I want you to march right back out to your Iittle spot there on-stage... ...read whatever's on the cue cards... ...and be Maya Dolittle, the animal talker, okay?. -Hey. -What's he trying to pull?. He can't talk to her Iike that. Right up there. Come on. Hey, everyone. You wanna help Maya out?. Then get that contract. This clown is going down. Let me at him. After him. Jump him. -Come on. -Bust a move. Charge. Hey. Hey. Hey, Iet go. You're about to get a mouthful of hoof, buddy boy. -Get him. -Give me that contract. What is going on here?. Hey, you, you back off. Get away from me. Okay, okay, stop. Stay right there. Back it up, back it up. Do you know who I am?. Turtle, that's far enough. Hey, you, stop it right there with your-- I don't even know what you are. Hey, get back there. Maya. Maya. Maya, tell these animals to back off, will you?. Oh, no, Rick, I'm sorry. I don't believe that's on the cue cards. Get away from me. Hey, stop. Get him. Stop! Stay back, fur balls. -After him. -I am on his tail. Where is he?. Everybody, split up. Follow your noses and sniff him out. His bacon is fried. Search and destroy. Oh, he is fertilizer now. This way. -Lucky. -I hope he Iikes warts. Let's put the squeeze on him. I can smell that rat around here. Lucky. Lucky, which way did he go?. This way. Come on. Where did he go?. This way?. -Come on, Iet's go. -Hey, there he goes. I'm after him. -Feet, do your duty. -Hey, out of my way, slowpoke. Oh, piggy. You think I am afraid of you?. I am D'Artagnan, and I am not afraid of anything. -Snake! -Hey, what's up?. -No! -Fork over that contract. Bull's-eye. Why, you Iittle.... That's it for you. AII right, easy there, big fellow. This town's not big enough for the two of us. You know what I want and I'm here to get it. Here I come, city boy. Okay, take it easy, horsey. Take it easy, okay?. Everything's cool. Everything's cool. Chicken. Cut. Thanks, buddy. You ruined the take. Sorry, everyone. Wow, Iooks great. Movies, Iove them. Mummies, spooky. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Hey, there's wind here, if you guys need it. Have a nice trip. Goodbye. Look. Lucky, there he is. After him. Maya, this way. There he is. Time for warp speed. Ape-Pollo 13, scene 1 6, take two. Action. My oxygen sensors indicate... ...the atmosphere on this alien planet is totally breathable. What do you think, Monkey?. Cut. Brilliant. I feel so cheap. No. -Lucky, hurry, he's getting away. -Excuse me. Looks Iike Maya needs me. And I think perhaps I need my dignity back. No, no, no. Hey. Hey, get that monkey back here or he's finished. Who cares?. What I really want to do is direct. Gotcha. SIow and steady wins the race. You stupid bunch of animals. You think you can make a fool out of Rick Beverly?. -You'II never get this contract. -Think again, blondie. -Finders keepers. -Hey, hey. Get back here. Monkey, what are you doing here?. Oh, I was just in the neighborhood and I-- Hey, give that back to Monkey. Come on. Oh, Monaco. Good job. Did I ever tell you you were my favorite client?. Now hand it over. Actually, I don't think I'm gonna do that, Rick. Excuse me?. I don't think it would be a very nice thing for a friend to do. What a friend would do is-- Monaco, before you do something that you might regret... ...remember, I still own you. Your name still belongs to me. You know what?. You can have it. It's not even my real name. You, and you. You will never work in this town again. None of you. I'II make sure of that. You call yourself a shark?. -I'm a shark. -Yeah, bite me. Oh, Tiffany, thank you so much. Hey, I'm the one that got you into this whole mess. The Ieast I could do is help you get out of it, right?. Well, she's not the only one who got you into it. -I mean.... -What?. What do you mean, Lucky?. I encouraged you to go to Los Angeles to do the show... ...even though I knew it probably wasn't the best thing for you. You did?. Why?. Because I didn't want you to go away to school. You're my best friend, Maya. I don't wanna Iose you. It's okay, Lucky. I understand, but you don't have to worry... ...because no matter where I go or what I'm doing... ...we will always be best friends, okay?. Deal. Maya?. Mom?. Mom. Wait, before you say anything, just please Iet me explain myself. I know I messed up. I know this TV show was a stupid idea. It's just a shortcut, and I realize that now. AII I wanna do is go to vet school, no matter how Iong it takes. -Helping the animals will be worth it. -I know. Mom, I know you're mad at me... ...and I'm sorry because I should have called, but-- Wait, what did you say?. Maya, I saw the whole thing. I am so proud of you. Thank you, Mom. We still have time to make it to registration?. -We could try. -Hello?. Private jet, remember?. Let's go. And so that's the story... ...of how Maya Dolittle started vet school. Let me tell you, it was a close one, all right. But you know what? It all turned out all right in the end. And as for me.... Hey, what can I say? She's my best friend. Did you really think... ...I was just gonna let her go off to college without me? But I wasn 't the only surprise Maya got at college. -Remember that Brandon guy? -Surprise. He decided to finally take that time off from Hollywood... ...and go to college. -Where do you think he applied? -I can't believe it. And since Brandon was there, guess who else showed up. So I guess it all worked out in the end. Boy, Hollywood sure is one crazy place... ...and it's probably best we all got it out of our systems. Well, almost all of us. And cut. AII right, everyone, that's a wrap. Now, will someone please bring me a banana Iatte?.
