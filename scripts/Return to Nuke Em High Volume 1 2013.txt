At that time, the Tromaville nuclear power plant had a horrifying meltdown, tainting the water supply of Tromaville High School, which was carelessly located right next door. Heinous mutations occurred, transforming the student body into radiated creatures and cretins. Well, not every student turned evil. Our heroes Warren and Chrissy saved the day by blowing up the nuclear power plant and the school therein, eliminating evil and setting things back to normal. Oh, and some other stuff also happened. But today, since criticizing nuclear power is no longer in vogue, at least in movies, the Tromaville nuclear power plant has been bulldozed to make way for the environmentally friendly, health-conscious Tromorganic Foodstuffs Inc, built directly on top of the old nuclear plant. What could go wrong? This is no typical remake. I want you to join me as we "Return to Nuke 'Em High"! Oh, by the way, excelsior! Nuke 'Em High Nuke 'Em High The sun comes up, a brand-new day The student body, time to pray They take that test, they concentrate 'Cause no one wants to be a waste But outside of The classroom walls The Geiger counter Tells it all Can't see or feel or smell or taste The remnants of the nuclear waste I just Really want to know I just Really want to know What's going on At Nuke 'Em High? What's going on At Nuke 'Em High? What's going on At Nuke 'Em High? What's going on... ( MAN AND WOMAN MOANING ) At Nuke 'Em High? WOMAN: That's hot. ( SCREECHING ) Your wiener feels like it's flopping around like a fish without oxygen. You're fishing with John, baby. Your name's John? No, it's Gil, but whatevs. OMG, fuck me with your fish dick, Gil! Oh! Something's got me. - I got you, baby. - No, no. Your box... it's biting me. Whatever you're doing, it's getting me hot. No, don't stop. ( BOTH SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) What kind of god...? ( JANITOR SINGING ) Nuke 'Em High What's going on At Nuke 'Em High? Eh. ( COW MOOING ) ( FACTORY WHISTLE BLOWS ) Stack some medals, don't make a fuss Forget about the two of us... ( DEVICE BLEEPING ) We're off to war - Doesn't matter if you'll agree - MAN: Hi. Hi. You're here to kill, you see... ( MAN OVER SPEAKERS ) Attention, Tromorganic employees, please stop dancing and acting goofy. President and CEO Herzkauf will be making his inspection shortly. And do your best... - ( MAN FARTS ) - Stick some bayonets In some chests... Now look, laddie, I want my ultracheap foodstuffs in every school in New Jersey at inflated prices. That is the basis of our plan, and you know it. No fast-food place will take my food anymore. Hmm? ( SCREAMS ) God damn it! Now you... you, Westly, as principal of the guinea pig charter school... - Sir, the president's on the line! - Give me that. Oh! Why do you do that? Yes, Mr. President. - Disconnected. - I'll get him back! Now what is all this about a rogue student blog, Pollution Nerdz, talking about my foodstuffs contaminating the groundwater and poisoning the students? It's slanderous. And it may be true. If word got out, we'd be ruined. I got him back! ( ARNOLD GASPS ) I'm going to... give me that. Give me that. Yes, Mr. President. Oh, everything is just going beautifully... beautifully. Look, there's... there's always gonna... ( HERZKAUF GURGLING ) There's always gonna be a Zuckerberg in every school. Everything's fine. Yes. And I'll see you in Havana. Yeah, I'll get the hookers. Don't bring Michelle. - Something wrong, boss? - Everything is fine. You just pay attention to that slogan the spinmasters gave us: "Propagation is health." "Propagation is health." And make sure... make sure those students at Tromaville High School are loving it! Are loving it! - Oh, man. - What do you want? This Plasti taco mix foodstuff don't look right, boss. Well, you want to go green, don't you? It looks green to me. ( LAUGHING LOUDLY ) Get over here, you bastard. Give me my milk. Give me that. Give me that. Ah! ( WOLF HOWLING ) ( MOANING ) You were 17... ( GRUNTING ) ( YELLING ) Do I look ripped, babe? Oh, yeah. - ( EUGENE PANTING ) - Yeah. Oh-ho-ho-ho. What's he gonna do? - What's he gonna do? - What's he gonna do? - Ohh-hh. - Ohh-hh. ( EUGENE MOANING ) Uh, Eugene. Eugene. Uh, Eugene. Eugene. Eugene! ( GASPS ) What is it? Uh, it's that time of the month and it's a horror movie down there, so... Again? That's what you said last week. You know, I have toxic shock syndrome from all the tampons. And I got a headache, so... Look, Chrissy, I think you're super sexy in a butch kind of way, which is weird, because what does that say about me? But we've been talking about having sweet, sweaty, dirty, kinky, really weird, fucked-up teenage sex in my big, blue, white-cream-leather-seat El Dorado for months now and this is all I get? You have to be kidding me! ( SCREAMS ) ( PANTING ) At least you broads won't let me down. ( GRUNTING ) Oh, I really need to get another subscription. ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) Argh! Oh, you're missing out. You're really missing out. You have no idea. Argh! Look out, Tromaville High. Here comes the new girl. Oh. ( GRUNTING ) Hey, new girl, look at these titties. They're bigger than yours. You want to go to the prom with me? Where you going? What's her deal? I don't know, but she is hot. She's a rich bitch. How the fuck would you know, micro phallus? ( WESTLY OVER SPEAKERS ) Attention, students. Please empty all items into the plastic tray before passing through the metal detector. We've gone three days without a shooting. Let's keep it up. Come on. She lives in Tromaville Heights. My dad sold her family their McMansion, kind of like the one you live in, Marilyn McManson. ( SNAPS FINGERS ) You twat. Thank God for Zoloft and thrift stores. Would you pull this, please? ( GRUNTING ) Please, please, please, let go, let go, let go. Come on, guys, let's go. - Oh. - ( ALARM PULSING ) ( DEVICE BEEPING ) ( WHIMPERS ) The pope retired. ( SCHOOL BELL RINGS ) Fuck you. - ( GRUNTS ) - Oh. I am so sorry. I really didn't... A brownnosing little rich girl late for intramural Ping-Pong? Ping-Pong is on Wednesdays. Today is Monday. I am right about one thing, though, Miley Cyrus: You are a brownnosing little rich girl. Looks like Mommy and Daddy won't be able to save you from a beating this time. You know what? Some of us actually have plans for our future that don't involve binge drinking, trailer parks or food stamps. - Ow! Fuck! - ( BOYS LAUGHING ) I'm gonna get you, rich girl. Ow. ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) LAUREN: Kevin, I'm home! ( QUACKING ) I love you, Kevin. I know you'll never leave me. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) ( LAUREN QUACKS ) It's great being rich and having a duck as a pet. ( INSECTS CHIRPING ) ( QUACKING ) CHRISSY: Okay, time to check my blog and see how many eyes I've opened up with my investigation of Tromorganic Farms. OMG! 18 whole page views. 18 people have checked in. What a month. I'll need more bandwidth. Here are some exclusive photos from member Deeper Throat. Not only does Tromorganics secretly mix in what appears to be sweetened wallpaper paste, but the contaminated groundwater is everywhere. ( YAWNING ) The contaminated... contamination... um... Cyber malaise. Tiredness. Horniness. Where is that one site with that chick that looks like Angelina Jolie in "Gia"? Jackpot. All aboard the skin boat to tuna town. - ( MOANING ) - Vagina, vagina Vagina in the sky Vagina, vagina Vagina in the sky... - ( MOANING LOUDER ) - Vagina In the sky, now every night... Is everything okay in here, dear? I heard crying. Yeah, Aunt Bee. I'm just feeling a little... Sad about being an orphan? Now that you mention it. No, that's not it. I bet I know what it is. - You do? - Well, of course I do. Don't worry, honey. Someday you'll find the right boy. ( CHUCKLES ) The right boy, yeah. And don't you worry, he won't be some deadbeat goat sucker like your stinking father, that twat. What's that? Looks like foreshadowing? Dinner's at 7:00. It's tuna. Please, God, get me out of this Tromaville hole. Ugh. ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) ( YAWNS ) ( FARTS ) Nooo! Kevin. Kevin. No. Macaroni. I'm calling But no one will be hearing... ( WESTLY OVER SPEAKERS ) Attention, students, due to a recent outbreak of jock itch and rectal rashes, Coach Sandusky would like all members of the boys' wrestling team to surrender their jockstraps to him immediately. ( PLAYING AND SINGING OUT OF TUNE ) Amazing Grace... How sweet... Attention, students. Now I know you're all looking forward to today's luncheon Super Duper Taco Tuesday Spectacular, but it's come to my attention that there's a blogger out there by the name of Lettuce Lover 69 and they run the blog called Pollution Nerdz. I have checked in on this Pollution Nerdz blog 18 times this month. Now this blog is spreading a lot of slanderous lies about Tromaville High and Tromorganic Foodstuffs Inc. They also have a very bad attitude towards conservative principles in general. ( SOBS ) Leave Ronald Reagan alone. - ( BLOWS WHISTLE ) - ( GIRLS GIGGLING ) Now I'm all for free speech. Otherwise why would I put out these thought-inhibiting announcements every morning? But these lies about contaminated, cheap and 98% Plasti filler tainted foodstuffs are just malarkey. Have you seen my duck? His name is Kevin. ( SNICKERS ) Oh. LAUREN: Have you seen my missing duck? SANDUSKY: Can a duck fill you up like Jesus? What kind of god allows an innocent duck to go missing? Hey, there's that snotty rich girl. I think she really likes me. - Hey, Twinkie. - Hey! Ah! What a rich, stuck-up bitch. Why won't anyone go out with me? Yo, did you hear Principal Westly's announcement? Are you gonna take down Pollution Nerdz? Yo, Jeraldo! Caw-caw! Caw-caw! Uh, would Gertrude Stein take down her blog? Hell, no. So I stay full steam ahead with Pollution Nerdz and let's sally forth. Gertrude Stein was a rich slacker bullshitter and her so-called poetry stunk. And please don't even go there with Sally Forth... another sexually repressed white American soccer mom who had boring adventures at work and at home with no vibrator. You deserve your own PBS special. - You know what you deserve? - What's that, Henry Gates? Two feet shoved up your fucking... Guys, my mom made me a juicy roast beef sammich with dipping sauce... dipping sauce. You heard what he said, guys... dipping sauce. You know what that means, right? Yeah, and I can feel my blood sugar dipping right now. - I want to eat it. - Let's go. It's cheaper than monkey shit, and these kids can't get enough of it in their gullet. BOY: Hey, what's that green stuff in the gluten-free tacos for Terrance, the glee club, and the other nerds? BOY #2: Oh, that? That's just nonchemically polluted guacamole. BOY #1: Wait, why did you mention they were nonchemically polluted? BOY #2: Uh, no reason. BOY #1: Eh, whatever. I'm hungry. ( CRUNCHING ) GIRL: Hey, Terrance! How's that green, gluten-free, nonchemically polluted taco? Maybe we need A different city Maybe we need A different town Maybe we need A different city Maybe we need A different town. Hi, guys. Mind if I sit here? No. Oh, my God. ( MAN FARTS ) Hi. I'm Lauren. - ( GUNFIRE ) - ( STUDENTS SCREAMING ) Don't worry, it's just another school shooting. CNN won't even cover them anymore. You can chill. Wow, rich girl ain't fucking around. Where did you get your lunch box... Tiffany's? ( LAUGHING ) Hey, you guys, I heard about this sick party/rave in one of Tromaville's 356 foreclosed houses. You all should come. That sick party/rave happens to be happening in my foreclosed house, thank you very much. But it's only a small gathering, so please keep it on the down low. Gross. Guys, guys, what with exams coming up and whatnot, a blowout party/rave is just what Eugene needs! Great. I'm so happy for Eugene, who refers to himself in the third person and will finally be able to blow off some steam at my expense. I actually heard on NPR that the stress of studying for exams and getting into a good college is actually worse than the stress our soldiers face in Afghanistan. - ( SNICKERS ) - The next time your car gets blown up by an IED or you're forced to bag the bodies of children killed by a suicide bomber, you tell me if that stress is greater than getting into Hobart. - ( CHRISSY SNAPS FINGERS ) - STUDENTS: Oh! Wow, Slater, you have family members in Afghanistan? No. But I did illegally download "The Hurt Locker" and got sued by the filmmakers. You see, Lauren, now that's stress. Look at this bitch and her Jap food. ( BOY GIGGLING ) Miso soup, me so hungry. ( LAUREN GRUNTING ) Get away from me, you bully. ( SLOWED DOWN ) I am so, so sorry. ( STUDENTS CHANTING ) Fight, fight, fight, fight! LAUREN: What are you doing? Punch her uterus! ( SHRIEKS ) Stop! That's enough. You are both going to detention after school today. That's it. Get out. - I'm gonna get you, rich girl. - Shut it! Get up. ( SNARLS ) Uh, Lauren, hi. Uh, my name is Zac. - Let me help you with that. - No, I got it. I just... I was wondering if sometime maybe you would want to come over and we could watch Joel Schumacher's "Batman and Robin." Or maybe you're more of a "Transformers" girl. They're more than meets the eye. As long as it's not one of those god-awful "Star Wars" prequels, we're all good. Zac, that's really nice and everything, but... - It's 'cause I'm fat, right? - No. - A lard-ass, right? - No. To you, I'm just a jelly roll, jizz dwarf, snatch badger, ass troll who eats donuts and cakes and Twinkies and pies with his fat, fat, fatty-fat piehole, right? What? What do all those words even mean? Or maybe... maybe you don't even like boys at all. No. No, it's because you smell like roast beef. ( ZAC WHIMPERING ) Shh. Shh. Shh. - Shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. - ( ZAC CONTINUES WHIMPERING ) Guys, guys, guys. We like that smell, right? - Roast beef? - No, he smells like shit. You shouldn't have said "Batman and Robin," man. It's "Batman Forever." "Batman Forever," baby. ( MOANING ) ( GAGGING ) Help. Help. ( GRUNTING ) BOY: Whoa. ( SCREAMING ) Goddamn diabetic kids. You're out of your mind. I love Justin Bieber. Justin Bieber is the best. TERRANCE: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! GIRL: Come on, guys. This is awesome. Come on. ( SCREAMING ) SANDUSKY: What in the name of Christ is going on here? Look, I love Justin Bieber. - ( STUDENTS SCREAMING ) - ( JIGGLES LAUGHING ) No! Why? - ( CELL PHONES CLICKING ) - OMG, this picture will totally get me at least six more forwards on Instagram. This is so going on my blog. I'm just waiting for Myspace to come back. WESTLY: Stop, everyone! Step back, come on. This is a horrible accident. Step back now. Step back. Give him his dignity. Is there a doctor in the house? ( POPS ) Scratch that. Is there a janitor in the house? Now it's a well-known fact that this student was a smoker of the marijuana. And I'm willing to bet that his dental records will prove he was a drama student. And the smoking of ganja has been known to cause cranial explosions and this type of thing in overly dramatic students. What? Wait, wait. Actually, I've just been informed that we've all witnessed here is in fact a drama department's latest venture. It's a remake of Arthur Miller's classic "Death of a Salesman" as imagined by Christopher Nolan. So nothing to see here. Everyone back to class. BOY: Hey, watch it. Why are you bullying me? What have I ever done to you? Bullying? You think I'm a bully? You want to know why? Because people like you have it so easy. Poor little rich girl never had to work a day in her life while I can barely afford lunch. It makes me sick. So fuck you. Why don't you stick your silver chopstick up your bento box? You don't know me. And I don't own any silver chopsticks. What's with the skinless Furbies? I like babies. I want to have a lot of them one day. Only fame-whore teen moms who want to be on MTV, rich kids and drooling idiots want to have babies. That's it, Chrissy Goldberg. To the principal's office, now. But Westly said if I show up one more time this year, he'll suspend me. Wait, Miss Bliss, it was me. I was the one who was talking. I'm new here and I don't know too many people, so I just... Well, all right. Just sit down and shut up. Okay. No more talking. That was stupid, rich girl. The new girl has beautiful hair. What did you say? Uh, I said old Westly looks like a fat-ass bear. ( LAUGHING ) Your jokes make me so hot. We should totally bang tonight. ( SHRIEKS ) Taco Tuesday was a huge success. But, unfortunately, we also suffered a horrible tragedy. We all loved and respected little Timmy... Tommy... Terrance Horowitz, I don't know. But like Mama Cass from The Mamas and the Papas who choked to death on a ham sandwich, this unfortunate kid, whatever his name was, suffered the same accidental fate. Now I can't stress enough the word "accidental" there. No! 'Twas those terrible Tuesday Tacos that tragically transformed Terrance. Nice alliteration, yo. Don't you people see? It was the food! Get him out. Get him out. - Security. Out. - No. - No. No. - Get him out of here. - No! - ( GIRL EXCLAIMING ) No. No! "The Class of Nuke 'Em High" was an inside job! You've got the wrong person, you blind bozo. Now I would like to further eulogize our decapitated comrade in education by having our lovely glee club come out to sing a song. ( STUDENTS BOOING ) You know, Patrick, the glee club isn't as gay as it used to be, thanks to the Fox Network. Head explod... head exploding is a serious problem, y'all. And we're here to talk about it. So if you're worried, don't be, 'cause we are too. Three, four... - ( OUT OF TUNE ) Amazing... - ( STUDENTS BOOING ) Grace - How sweet... - GIRL: This sucks. The sound - That saved... - GIRL: Get off the stage! A wretch Like me I once Was lost But now I'm found Was blind... ( CRUNCHING ) But now - I see. - I see! ( SCREAMING ) ( GASPS ) Oh! ( CHEERING ) Yeah! ( GROWLS ) ( SHRIEKS ) GIRL: Oh, my God, the glee club is bulimic! ( ROARING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( ROARING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( GROANING ) Ah! Hey, wait up. Do you guys notice anything different? Whoa, we've mutated. And my wheelchair has illogically mutated too. And I think I can feel my legs. No, never mind. Still a cripple. Oh, snap. Kick-fucking-ass! - Yeah. - ( ALL ROARING ) Whoa. ( CACKLES ) Come on. ( LAUGHING ) Stack some medals - Don't make a fuss... - ( GUNSHOTS ) Forget about the... ( TIRES SCREECH ) ( GIRL SCREAMS ) These jugglers are fucking nuts. ( GUNSHOTS ) - ( AIR HISSES ) - ( ALL SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( TAKES A BREATH ) ( CONTINUES SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING STOPS ) We're alive. It's a motherfucking miracle. ( GUNSHOT ) ( LAUGHING ) ( DOG BARKS, FARTS ) - What kind of a god allows me... - ( QUACKS ) ...on this crappy teacher's salary to be forced to live out of my car? What kind of a god are you? I'd even take a shoebox apartment, even if it is in Tromaville crack town. - ( TIRES SCREECH ) - CRETINS: Whoo! Uh-oh. ALL: Hey, Mrs. Crabtree. ( SCREAMING ) Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline... ADELINE: Your singing is terrible. My Adeline My Adeline... At night, dear heart At night, dear heart... For you I pine For you I pine... ( CONTINUES SCREAMING ) - Hey, Mrs. Crabtree. - Huh? You know, when I was a kid, all the kids used to tease me, call me a cripple. Yeah, yeah. Now I'm the only one I know that can run a quarter mile each day on their arms! Do it. - ( QUACKS ) - ( ADELINE SCREAMS ) Oh, snap. ( LAUGHS ) Oh, my God, I'm hard... ( SPITS ) ...for the first time. Oh. - Oh, my God. - ( PUMPING ) Oh, my God, I'm hard. Oh, God! ( LAUGHING ) - Ein... - ( QUACKS ) ...zwei, drei! ( SCREAMS ) ( SPLASHES ) Oh, snap. ( ROARS ) ( LAUGHS ) Come on, come on. Ichi, ni, san! ( DOG WHINING ) ( LAUGHING ) KEVIN: What the fuck? Hey! - Let's go shoot up a movie theater. - Yeah. ( QUACKING ) ( FARTS ) LAUREN: Kevin! ( KEVIN QUACKS ) - Kevin! - ( KEVIN QUACKING ) Kevin, where are you? ( KEVIN QUACKING ) Kevin! ( KEVIN QUACKING ) Kevin. Oh. Oh, don't you ever, ever, ever do that again. Do you hear me? I was so worried about you. It's okay. It's okay. - Mommy's here now. - ( KEVIN FARTS ) Oh, poor baby, what's all over your beak? ( KEVIN QUACKS ) - ( CRETINS GRUNTING ) - ( MOTOR REVVING ) ( KEVIN QUACKING ) ( CRETINS LAUGH ) - Oh, oh, oh, oh - KEVIN: Quack One little, two little, three little ducklings Four little, five little, six little ducklings Seven little, eight little, nine little ducklings - Ten little tiny ducks. - Give him back. Please give me my duck back. Please give me my duck back. Oh, for a kiss, I will. I'd just as soon kiss a duck. I can arrange that. ( SCREAMING ) Oh, no, no. Please, no. - ALL: Duck rape! - ( LAUGHING ) - Give me the duck. - Duck rape! Smile for the birdie. - Duck rape. - ( KEVIN QUACKING ) ( LAUGHING ) Loser. Loser. ( SCREAMING ) ( KEVIN QUACKING ) I'm sorry. ( COCKS GUN ) If you guys were tough, you wouldn't need weapons. - ( MUFFLED SCREAMS ) - ( MUFFLED QUACKING ) Sorry, I'm kind of busy right now. Whoa. Sorry, duck down throat is not covered under Obamacare. Ugh. ( SHOP BELL DINGS ) ( LAUREN WHIMPERING ) - ( SCREAMS ) - ( KEVIN QUACKS ) - ( GONG SOUNDS ) - ( KEVIN QUACKING ) GIRLS: Ooh. ( LAUREN MUMBLING ) Uh, I'm still busy. Ooh! Gonna kill myself tonight, oh, yeah - Kill myself tonight, all right. - ( LAUREN SCREAMING ) Shit. ( TIRES SCREECH ) - Hey. - ( HONKING HORN ) Why did the chick with a duck in her mouth cross the road? Get in, foul mouth. What, is this some kind of political statement, rich girl? - ( MUMBLING ) - Really? Really? - God damn. - ( MUMBLING ) Oh, whatever, I owe you one. That bird in your mouth really brings out your eyes. All right, welcome. Okay, um... eww. ( KEVIN QUACKING ) ( GRUNTING ) - ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) - Oh. What? ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( FARTS ) - Oh! - ( KEVIN QUACKS ) Ugh. - I... - Oh, I... Come on, we'll just go relax. Aw. - ( KEVIN QUACKING ) - Hi, Kevin.

Oh, I should go, let you get ready. Uh, rich girl... do you want to go? ( BOTH GIGGLE ) ( CROWD CHEERING ) ( BOTH BELCH ) I got a call from the other side today When he hung up the phone, I forgot to hear what he had to say... Really? Does this look like a garbage dump to you? Chrissy. Some assholes posted my address on Facebook. Now look. I think it was the producers of "The Hurt Locker." They had my IP address. I know it. Uh-huh. Slater, you remember Lauren? Yeah. Aloha. Didn't you guys hate each other, like, eight hours ago? Uh, don't you want to get rid of the social hand grenades? Whoa! Us black people can't get enough white pussy, and I'm just saying that my chances might be pretty solid if I get a white girl drunk enough. MAN: Yo, Slater, the donkey took a huge shit in the bathtub. I gotta go. Do you hang up the phone and do you lay it to rest... - Feeling better? - Yeah, much. Thanks. I needed to get my mind off that, you know, duck rape. ( PHONE CHIMES ) Eugene just broke up with me. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. Over a text? Yeah. He's an idiot. He didn't even finish the message. ( GAGGING ) Eww. - Let's dance. - Okay. This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight Gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight Gonna kill myself, gonna kill myself Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself Gonna kill myself Gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight This is the last song I'll ever write Gonna kill myself tonight I'm gonna kill myself tonight This is...

I think we should. You can't even wear a hoodie and eat Skittles in this town without getting shot. A hoodie? Are you saying being gay is worse than being black? No, I'm saying that in this town people think that LGB stands for "lynch, grope, bully, torture." I'll stick with the closet, thanks. ( GRUNTS ) Whoa, Eugene likes it rough. Eugene needs some. Yeah? You want to see this? Whoa. ( BOTH MOANING ) I'm gonna show 'em to you, baby. I'm gonna show you everything I got. Baby, Eugene needs to see. Oh. Oh-ho-ho. ( LAUGHING ) Oh, yeah.

( EUGENE LAUGHING ) ( LAUGHING ) ( CHEERING ) Let's get out of here. ( SPEAKS JAPANESE ) But I'm also saying that I've never felt this way before. Me either. It's the love that dare not speak its name. - This is hot. - Yeah, this is so hot. No, like really hot. Like, I'm burning up. Wait, do you smell smoke? - Fire! - Fire!

But that means every wife. And mother-in-law in Tromaville. That's the point. Now go, kill all women with giant penises. Sir, the president's wife is on the line.
