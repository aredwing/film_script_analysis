See you. - Hope not. - That's 416, coming up. - That is 416. - Well, that's a good floor for that one. Nobody ever goes up there. Well, look who's back. Hello, stranger. Hello, Abe. Oh, no. - I thought you'd sworn off this place. - Well, I thought I had too. ABE: You got homesick for us, right? Didn't have much choice. Been barred from the Atheneum. ABE: Come on. Nobody gets barred from the Atheneum. How did you manage that? - Well, there was this man there... - A fat man, right? Fat? He was the Magic Mountain. He drove me into one of my frenzies. I went berserk and kicked his door open. So they threw me out, told me never to come back. I was willing to pay for it. I just wanted to talk. You know how I am. - Hey, you wanna check that? - Oh, no, no. That's my costume. I'm entered in a talent contest tonight. It's good to be back, Abe. I feel strangely optimistic about this evening. - Yeah, well, don't kick any doors in. - I hope I don't have to. Driver, I left my money. Will you wait? I'll be right back. 320 coming up.

Blue Cross, Rotary Club, driver's license. Here. Here's my business card. "Proclo Sanitation Services, Gaetano Proclo, president." That's me. - I'm sorry. PROCLO: Oh, come on. Do I look like someone who would try to pass a bad check? Yeah. Yeah, of course I do. Now can you see me? Everything else is real. Who are you running from? My maniac brother-in-law who's gonna kill me tonight if he can find me. You're looking at a potential dead man. I'm begging you. It's a matter of life and death. CHRIS: Hey, all right. - Does anybody have a cab waiting? PROCLO: What? - Is that your cab out there? PROCLO: Yeah. You've also got one very pissed off driver. PROCLO: How pissed off is he? On a 10 scale, 10. Darn it. Please! Well, I really shouldn't be doing this, but... - You're a good man...? - Abe. Abe.

You give him my love, will you? - Sure thing. - He need someone to practice with? - He's been practicing. - That's why he has to get married. - Yeah. Well, compared to me, Abe, she would have to be an amateur. Ronald Reagan? Oh, come on, Chris. Oh, you know he used to be lovers with John wayne. ABE: Sure he did. Right after he broke up with Xavier Cugat. People like you think the world is queer. Well, it's lucky for people like you it is. [CAB DRIvER LAUGHING] All right. CAB DRIvER: Change a 10. He can't change a 10. Do you believe it? New York City, one of the great cities of the world. This driver I have can't change a 10. Hey, did I ever have you? - What? - I've got a rotten memory that way. - You never used to live in Rego Park? - No. CHRIS: You look like someone I knew from Rego Park. PROCLO: I'm afraid not. CHRIS: He was a large man like you. He was in ladies shoes, I remember. Well, I'm from Cleveland and I'm in refuse. Excuse me. CHRIS: I guess not, then. Sorry. PROCLO: Perfectly all right. A gay garbage man? You never can tell. That's so true. I mean, look at me. If you just saw me walking down the street you'd think I was a queen. [WHISTLE BLowlNG] Try to hold out, men.

Three or four hours should be sufficient for my purposes. I don't care what your purposes are. Twelve is our minimum. - All right, 12 then, sir. - All right, that's 10 bucks. You check your valuables and sign the register. Tell me something. Has a... Balding, middle-aged, fat man come in here recently? I don't believe what just came in here recently. You're not a cop, are you? I'm a detective. Michael Brick, the Greybar Agency. What do I do now? Through there and up the stairs. - Someone will show you your room. - Thank you, sir. - And let me give you a little tip, Brick. - Yes, sir? Stay out of the steam room. - Why, sir? - It gets pretty wild in there. Oh, I can take it, sir. In my line of work, I get to do a lot of wild things. This is my first seduction job. - Wish me luck. - With that voice you gonna need it. Save your money. Ten bucks for this place is 10 bucks for nothing. [CHATTERING IN SPANISH] No rain, he tells me.

No, it's okay, I can take it. Tell me I look like shit. Why would I say something like that to such an attractive young lady? You boys really know how to cheer up a girl when she's down in the dump. My boyfriend Hector see me do that, he killed you with a knife this big. He hates maricnes, that Hector. It's okay. He's a ball-breaker with me too, mister. But I'm going to show them, chico. And tonight is the night I'm going to do it. I heard on the grapevine... ...there's going to be a big producer out in the front... ...watching your show tonight. Unquote. Some day you're going to see the name of Googie Gomez in lights. And you are gonna say to yourself: "Was that her?" And then you gonna answer to yourself: "That was her." But you know something, mister? I was always her, just nobody knows it. - Who the hell was that? - Googie. - I thought this is a bathhouse. ABE: It is. - No, I mean, a male bathhouse. - It is. - What she doing in here? - Googie sings in The Pits. The pits? What pits? - The nightclub. - You got a nightclub in there? We got nightclub, movies, swimming pool, steam room, massage table... ...discothque, bridge, amateur night and free blood tests every wednesday. ABE: How did it go today, Mo? Eh. [SIGHS] Oh, boy. I don't wanna even think what she does. Mo is just our accountant. When I couldn't get a plane, I told the cab... ...to bring me to the last place Carmine would look for me. You found it. Now, you put your valuables in there. - And you sign the book. - Thank you. Except everybody in the world's already in there. - I need calm, safety, privacy tonight. ABE: All right. Keep your door locked and stay in your room. Don't worry, I will. "Ronald Reagan"? ABE: You can write John Doe for all I care. - Any name at all? Abe, I'm gonna talk to the pope about getting you canonized. "Carmine vespucci." Bensonhurst... "...Brooklyn." Who's that? My maniac brother-in-law. He was gonna kill me tonight. - What did you do? - I got born and married his sister. Listen, do you mind if I ask you a personal question? The man who save my life can ask me anything at all. - You ever been in a place like this? - Oh, sure. We got a Jack De Lane's in Cleveland. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

Orgy in 340, four minutes. I couldn't resist taking this panettone back with me. I just love panettone and you can't get this brand in Cleveland. Do you like panettone? - It's right here. - Oh, thank you. Uh... Uh... This doesn't look like room 210. See, there are clothes here. You'll never guess what I made for dinner so I'm going to tell you. - I beg your pardon? - A nice, rich, ground-pork meatloaf... ...with mozzarella cheese center, gobs of mashed potatoes swimming in gravy... ...carrots floating in butter and for a salad, avocado chunks with Roquefort dressing. Could you just die? I could just... - I don't know what I could... - Then, Dutch chocolate cake... ...with big scoops of mocha walnut ice cream... ...and a fudge malted. - It sounds delicious. - You could have been there. - I was in Brooklyn. - Lf you'll excuse me. - Oh, wait, wait, wait.

[CLAUDE SQUEALING] All right, fat man, leave the little guy alone. Come. Aren't you supposed to be in 210? You get up there and don't cause any more trouble. What do you think this is, the YMCA? Listen, I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Oh. Well, I certainly hope not. Hello. Boy, I had quite a little experience in there. That guy's got quite a problem. People like that shouldn't be allowed in a place like this, you know. My, what unusual pants. They look like cowboy chaps. They are cowboy chaps. Yeah, I was just thinking I thought they looked like cowboy chaps. Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I'd like to get out of these clothes. Goodbye, it was nice talking to you. [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] BRICK: Hello. Mr. Vespucci? My name is Michael Brick. I'm with the Greybar Detective Agency. You hired my partner a couple of hours ago... ...to get something on a Mr. Gaetano Proclo tonight. Only my partner's sick, so I'm taking over for him. Now, I believe you said we'd find him at the Ritz. I just got here. Now, what exactly did you want me to get on him, sir? All I need is a room number with you and him in it. That sounds easy enough, sir. Let me see if I've got his description right. A balding, middle-aged fat man. That's not much to go on, Mr. Vespucci. But I'll do my best. One of those transvestites is standing right next to me. I'll have to... [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] I can't talk now. I think he's surrounding me for unnatural things. Hey, chico, I was just going talk to you. Hello, boys. Is he here yet? - Who? - Who? What did you mean who? There is only one "who" I'm interested in you telling me about. Listen, Tiger, you told me there was going to be a big producer here tonight. I dress special. I do the hairs special. - Lf you are lying to me, Tiger... - Hey, can't you take a little joke? My career is no joke. - Nobody's career is never no joke. - We were just trying to build you up. Listen, I tell you something, and I mean this. You ever hear of instant laryngitis? No producer be out there tonight. That's what I got. Instant laryngitis. And you and Duff are going to do the show alone. Those are my words. They come from the heart. And I am now officially sick. Come on, Tiger. Showtime. - What do you mean? - Googie's Mr. Big Producer just checked in. - He's gonna be sitting poolside. - Well, how we gonna manage that? We're not. But with a little help from our friend here... Are you 210? - Yeah, something like that. - No, I meant your room. - Oh, so did I. - It's right this way. - Follow us. - Thank you. Boy, this place is like a Chinese maze. Just try to stay out of 105 from here on, all right? What's in 105? That's the room I had to pull you out of. You could hurt somebody doing that. Wait a minute, I thought that guy was taking me to my room. You don't think I went in because I wanted to? You trying to tell us he's a chubby chaser? A chubby what? You know. It's somebody who likes... - You mean, like me? - You're right up his alley. I knew a guy like that once. I didn't know what to call him. "Get-Away-From-Me Claude" was all I could come up with. Chubby chaser. Hey, that's pretty funny. Unless you happen to be the chubby they're chasing. Thanks for the tip. - Now if you need anything, Mr...? - Vespucci. Carmine vespucci.

I don't like to bug producers just before they catch your act... ...so I just want to tell you one thing. In my second number, "Shine on Harvest Moon"... ...the orchestra and me sometimes get into different keys. But if you know, it won't matter. Other than that, the act is fabulous and I just know you're going to love it. CLAUDE: Vespucci. - Yes. I'm sure it is. You are too guapo to be a producer. Guapo? Handsome. Who, me? Oh, come on, I'm ugly, I'm very ugly. Ah, with a face like that, you could have been an actor. You still could, it's never too late. Look at Catrina valente, vicki Carr. - Yeah, but they're real women. GOOGIE: Oh, no. PROCLO: They're not? Plastic Puerto Ricans. I am the real thing. You are the real thing and I knew you were in show business. - Me? - Oh, I knew I'd seen you someplace. I was in the Cleveland Little Theater Masque and Mummer's... ...spring production of Sound Of Music... ...but I wouldn't call that show business. - Oh, yes? What part? It was really more of a walk-on. GOOGIE: I was in that show. PROCLO: You were in The Sound of Music? GOOGIE: Oh, sure. Where was this? Broadway. The mainstream, where else? - The original cast? - Oh! I was more original than anyone else in it. They fired me the first day of rehearsal, those bastards. They said I wasn't right for the part. What part was that? Oh, one of those fucking Trapp kids. But you know what the real reason was, mister? They found out what you really were. No. Seymour Pippin. Who? Oh, shit. Seymour Pippin. He was the company manager. If there is one man that I was born to kill with my own two hands... ...it's Seymour Pippin. But I fix them. I picket that show until they was crazy. I picket. I picket. I picket. I picket that show every night until I got a part in Camelot. [STEAM HISSING] - You were in Camelot too? - Oh, sure. Oh, boy. That's a wonderful show. It's a piece of shit. - They fired you from that one too, huh? - Sure, they fire me. What did you expect? Thanks to Seymour Pippin, I get fired from everything. - I can't imagine why. - Oh, yeah? You see this face? It's a curse. All right. Come on, keep away from me. GOOGIE: Don't fight it. - Believe me, you won't be happy. I won't be happy. You're making a big mistake. - I am suddenly all woman. - No, you're not. - You're someone with a lot of problems. - Aye, make me feel like a real woman. That's not my department. That's out of my hands. GOOGIE: Kiss me. - Come on. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, shit. TIGER: Let's go, Googie, we're on. DUFF: Fuck. GOOGIE: Come on, my Mr. Big Producer. You're going to love my show.

If you can hear me, knock once. If you can't, knock twice. BRICK: "Knock once." CARMINE: Are you there, Brick? [KNOCKS ONCE] Good, our signals are working. Now listen to me. Have you seen that balding, fat slob brother-in-law of mine yet? [KNOCKS TWlCE] What does that mean, no? [KNOCKS ONCE] Okay, I think I read you. Now... ...I know he's around here somewhere. What I don't know is how you could miss him. He's a house. Wait a minute. Somebody's coming. Forget it. Listen, Brick. None of these fruits tried to pull anything with you, did they? [KNOCKS ONCE] Oh, my God. I'll make it up to you. Meet me in room 224 in 15 minutes. Knock three times. Got that? [KNOCKS THREE TIMES] Not now, stupid, then. You don't have to worry about him leaving this place. Leaving in one piece, I mean. I got all my men waiting for him. Ain't that great, Brick, huh? [KNOCKS ONCE] I knew you'd like that. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Stay with us. There she goes. Yeah. CLAUDE: Vespucci. - Vespucci. - Aah! Wait, vespucci, wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. PROCLO: Go away. Go away. Get off. [CLATTERING] Leave me alone. [CLAUDE AND PROCLO GRUNTING] [GOOGIE SQUEALING] [GIGGLING] [GOOGIE SCREAMS] TIGER: Sorry, Googie. [APPLAUSE] [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] This way... vespucci. Where is this skinny little man who ruined my act? I kill him. [CHATTERING IN SPANISH] CLAUDE: Vespucci. Vespucci. Vespucci. [CLAUDE LAUGHING] TIGER: Googie, wait. You can't go in there. You think I don't know what goes on in this place? All of you men going: "Hee, hee, hee! Poo, poo, poo! Ha, ha, ha!" TIGER: Googie, no. [GOOGIE SHOUTING IN SPANISH] MAN: Ow! [CLAUDE SCREAMING] CLAUDE: You could use a good psychiatrist, mister. - What did you call me? - He didn't mean it. Tell her you're sorry. CLAUDE: I haven't seen such tacky drag since the Princeton varsity show. - Tacky drag? CLAUDE: Thirty years ago, Sonny boy. [SCREAMING IN SPANISH] [CLAUDE GRUNTING] I'm going straight. Were you in there for all that? You don't wanna talk about it? - Why are you wearing your clothes? PROCLO: I'm going to Central Park. CHRIS: For somebody who's never been in a place like this... ...you're certainly getting around. [WHIRRING] CHRIS: I thought you were gonna stay in your room. PROCLO: I can't. Tiger and Duff told Googie I was Carmine vespucci. Claude thinks I'm Carmine vespucci. Everybody thinks I'm Carmine vespucci. CHRIS: Who are you? PROCLO: Carmine vespucci. BRICK: Are you Mr. Carmine vespucci, sir? Hello, kid, you got a light? Are you him, Mr. Vespucci? - Say yes. Say yes. - Yes. I'm Michael Brick. My room's right up there. I'm Chris. My room is right up there too. BRICK: Hi, Chris, how are you? [CHRIS CHUCKLES] [PHONE RINGS] [SCREAMS] Now. This is what I thought we'd do. Get under the bed. - Another one. - All right, stay there. Stay there. Now, we pretend that you're him and I'm me... ...and the real you is under the bed. Only this one's the worst. Sit down, Mr. Vespucci. Now, get the picture. The lights are low. He's moving down the hallway... ...when finally he sees me. I'm leaning against the door. I put one knee up. I flex. I've caught his eye. I wink. I kind of beckon with my head. And finally, I speak. See something you like, buddy? I'm resting. That's the tough-guy approach. Is that your real voice? - Why? Does it bother you? - No. No. No. - Some people find it very irritating. - I can't image why. Me either. Of course, I'm used to it. I've had it ever since I was a kid. I mean, I grew up and matured. Only, my voice didn't. - Where was I? - The tough-guy approach. - Oh! And then... - I'm having a nightmare. - This is where you jump out. You see, I'm not queer. Boy, you could have fooled me. BRICK: So you're gonna have to help me find your brother-in-law, Mr. Vespucci. What? My brother-in-law? I can't find anyone who fits Mr. Proclo's description. - Who are you? - Michael Brick. - What are you? - A detective. [ALARM BUZZING] Quick, it's time. Get under the bed. For what? BRICK: I left a note by the Coke machine saying: "Any middle-aged, fat, balding man whose initials are G. P... ...interested in a good time, should meet me here at midnight sharp." Just leave everything to me. I'm right on top of you. I can't tell you how comforting that is. ABE [o vER P.A.]: Anyone interested in forming... ...a Ritz softball team, contact Howard. MAN: I'm resting. [KNOCKS] CARMINE: I said knock three times. Oh, he's being masterful with me already, the brute. CARMINE: That's more like it. - I think I'm in love. Hi. [CHRIS GRUNTS THEN CLATTERING] Ow. CARMINE: Hey, let me get a look at you. [CHUCKLES] I'm no judge of fruit bait, but you'll do. Oh, let's just cool it, sweetheart. This is not the Meat Rack, huh? You can can the fag act with me, Brick. Now listen, I think I've come up with something. This sounds like the oldest stunt in the book... ...but I'm gonna hide under your bed. On the contrary, that's a first for me. You never tried the under-the-bed technique? Well, not till recently. - What kind of a detective are you? - Now, that's a good question, honey. Can it, Brick. Just can it. One thing I don't like is a wise guy. The only thing I don't like more is a queer wise guy. I'm calling the shots now, and I'm getting under your bed. - Uh, where am I supposed to be? - On top of it, stupid. Oh, that sounds fabulous. What then? You know. Do what you have to do. - What's that? - How should I know? Wiggle your fanny. Shake your towel in his face. - Whose face? - My brother-in-law's, you dummy. The guy I hired you to catch. Then I pop out, catching you both in the act of fragrant delicto... ...and, wham, we got him. - Your brother-in-law. Who else? Jesus, you're like talking to a yo-yo. - Dumb and dizzy, that's me, darling. - Jesus! Listen, that's just a little more of that gay humor. All right, all right, all right. Now... ...you go back to 201. Hey, wait a minute. - No. Not yet. - No. When you get there... ...you whistle like this: [WHISTLES] I hightail it to your room, slide under... ...and we're in business, got that? - Check. - It's about time. - Only I can't whistle. Goddamn it, you can't whistle either? I thought all dicks could whistle. Just "Stormy weather." Look, I tell you what, Mr... - vespucci. Carmine vespucci. - Carmine vespu... only don't call me that. He might hear us. - I need a code name. - Evelyn. [SIGHS] No, I don't like Evelyn. It sounds... ...effeminate. How about Bunny? Bunny's good. Bunny, you get under this bed. That way, I won't have to whistle... ...and you won't have to hightail it to 201. Hey, maybe you're not so dumb after all, Brick. Hey, hey, hey. I'll tell you... I'll tell you one thing, with Papa gone now... Papa! [CRYING] I ain't sharing no vespucci Sanitation Services and Enterprises Inc. With no fairy. - Your brother-in-law's a fairy? - He's gonna be. - What are you gonna do? - Kill him. Oh, good. You know what a delitto di passione is, Brick? It's a crime of passion. An enraged brother... ...catching his dear, sweet sister's balding, fat, slob husband... ...in an unnatural act with one of these fruitcakes from around here. [LAUGHING] There ain't no court in the country that would convict. Twenty years I waited for this night, Brick. You're looking at a man of great and terrible passions. - Well, I can see that, Bunny. CARMINE: What happened? That's how you do it around here. Now get under this bed. CARMINE: Yeah. - Yeah, go ahead. Get under the bed. I'll leave this door open, you see, so he can come in. Go ahead. I'll be right up here on top. - Now, shh. Don't say another word now. CARMINE: Right. ABE [OVER P.A.]: Tonight's double feature in our mini cinema... ... is All About Eve and A Star Is Born. Hey, you know any good stories? - As a matter of fact, I do, sir. - Skip it. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] That must be him. Hold your horses, stud. It's open. Oh. BRICK: See something you like, buddy? You've gotta be kidding. False alarm, Mr. Vespucci. CHRIS: Where is your friend? - He's under the bed. Why not? Everybody else is. I always wondered what you straight guys did together. Oh, now that I know, I'm so glad I'm gay. Oh, yeah, that brother-in-law of yours, that maniac? - Yeah. He's just down the hall. - What? - And he's got a gun. - What? Now he's after you, Mr. Vespucci. You didn't mention anything about a gun. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] CHRIS: That's him. - I'm scared. - You're scared? Move over. - No room. - I can fit. - I was here first. - It's my brother-in-law. - It's my ass. PROCLO: Answer the door. - Where you going? - It's not him. - Who is it? - It's that transvestite again. What are you talking about? Oh, hello. - Who's there? GOOGIE: I know you're in there, chico. - Now, look. - Shh! Don't speak. Don't say nothing. Say one word, then Googie is out on her ass. She is breaking every book in the rule doing this. Do you know why you don't like women? Because you never try it, that's all. Or maybe you try it and that's why. She was a bad woman. Forget her. Believe me, chico. It don't hurt. It's nice. You just lay back there, and Googie is going to show you how nice. - Look, I'd like to help you out... - All right, all right. Shh. Think... ...of a tropical night. Think... ...of a beach. What "bitch"? The moon is shining on the sea. And in the distance, over the waves, you hear music. [SINGING] [GOOGIE, CHRIS AND BRICK SINGING] This is not gonna work, Mr. Googie. - Mr. Googie? - There's just no way. Mr. Googie? You thought I was a drag queen? No such luck, chico. You mean to tell me that you're really a miss? This is all real. Yeah, they feel real. I just hope I'm going to find me some huevitos. - What are huevitos? - These. - Oh! - Aye! - Oh, chico. - Oh, no. They're real too. I know we're going to make such whoopee together, chico. - No, there's one thing wrong. - Yes. My brother-in-law's out to kill and somebody's under this bed. Oh, no, you don't. I'm not falling for that old hat-and-dance routine. You're not pulling no wool over my ears so easy. I swear to God there is. - Never try to shit an old pro, chico. BRICK: He's not. There is someone under this bed. Us. If you wanna bounce around up there, I'll gladly go back to my own room. That is a rotten stunt, mister. I could lose my job for this. I throw the whole wind into the caution to come here. - Look, I can explain every... - I don't need no explain. You would rather make: Hee, hee, hee, poo, poo, poo, ha, ha, ha... ...with that maricn you got hiding under the bed. - Two maricns, Googie. - Who's that down there? CHRIS: It's me, Chris. Oh, hi, Chris. What are you doing down there? - I wish I knew. - You lose something? BRICK: See, the reason we're under this bed... You. Not only do you got a fat boyfriend, you maricn hump, you got a mean one. I'm not his boyfriend and I'm not gay. With a voice like that, you're no straight arrow neither. I was born with this voice. So was Yma Sumac. [PROCLO GRUNTING] Where do you think you're going? I'm just someone in a lot of trouble, see. You're not staying for my second show? I am not a producer. It was your two friends' idea. Wait a... Hey. - Wait a minute. - Hmm? - Seymour Pippin. - Who? You don't fire Googie Gomez from no show and get away with it, you bastard. You think I forget your face? I'm gonna tear all of your eyes out. That's Mr. Vespucci. - You promise? - I promise. Oh, what do you know? I thought it was Seymour Pippin. [KNOCKING ON DOOR THEN GOOGIE GASPS] It's for you. BRICK: If it's him, Mr. Vespucci, you just give me... what the hell happened to you? You said you'd be on top. I've been under that damn bed so long I can hardly walk. - See something you like, buddy? CARMINE: What the...? You looking for a good time, Mac? You're not Brick. Where's Brick? What have you done to him? Lie down. Get your hands off me. [BED SPRINGS RATTLING] - Somebody's under there. - Just lie down and stretch out on the bed. CARMINE: What are you doing? BRICK: I'm trying to seduce you. CARMINE: Get your hands off, I'll lay your head open. BRICK: Is it him, Mr. Vespucci? CARMINE: Yes. Vespucci? I'm vespucci. BRICK: Is it? PROCLO: Yes, it's him, it's him. I know that voice. What the hell is this? One of them goddamn "transvestitites," sure you are. Seymour Pippin. I kill you, pendejo. I tear your eyes out. You think you can fire Googie Gomez from a show... ...and get away with it, you bastard? [GOOGIE SHOUTING IN SPANISH] Hey, fight fair, you faggot. You lay one hand on her, Mr. Proclo, and I'm gonna break... - Proclo? Proclo? - Get him, for chrissake. Step aside, miss. [GIBBERING] [SQUEALING] [GLASS SHATTERING] PROCLO: Get me out of here, will you? Oh, we were just starting to have such fun. Hey, do you know something? This man is not Seymour Pippin neither. - I wonder who he is? - It's my brother-in-law. [GASPS] - Is he in show business? - No, he's in garbage. A gay garbage man? I'm a detective. Mr. Vespucci here hired me... ...to get something on his brother-in-law, Mr. Proclo here. So that Mr. Proclo won't inherit half of the family business. So that's it. GOOGIE: Amigo. - I'll kill... GOOGIE: No, no, no. Mr. Vespucci wanted to catch Mr. Proclo and I together... ...so that he could commit a delitto di passione. - Look out now, you'll be in the picture. - Oh, picture. What picture? Hey. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I see what you do. If that man want to be here, let him be here. What do you care? Listen, I don't stand still for no blackmail. I tell Tiger and Duff what you do and you are on your ass, big boy. And I thought you were nice. Come on, Chris. I still like Evelyn. - Happy birthday, honey. - Thank you. Can't you hit him again? Oh, come on now, Mr. Vespucci, that wouldn't be ethical. Ethical? Your line of work and you're telling me what's ethical? Come on. Well, you really blew it this time, Carmine. By the time you get out of this place, I'll be in Cleveland with vivian and the kids. Fat man in 201. Come and get it. He's all yours. Fat man in 201. Come and get it. He's all yours. Fat man in 201. Fat man in 201. [PHoNE RINGS] Come and get it. Hello? I'll fix you. You'll get nowhere without your clothes. - Come and get it. BRICK: Michael Brick speaking. Fat man in 201. BRICK: I'll see if I can find him. - It's for you, Mr. Vespucci. PROCLO: Who is it? Who is this, please? It's Mrs. Proclo calling from a bar across the street. Shh. Mrs. Proclo? My God, that's vivian. Tell her I left. I'm sorry, Mrs. Proclo, but he just left. She doesn't believe me. Tell her she has to believe you. He says you have to believe me, Mrs... She says she's coming over now. Nothing's gonna stop her. She's putting on a man's hat and coat. Hello? - I didn't even get to tell her the good news. - What good news? We got our man. MAN: I'm sorry, mister, but you can't... oh! Ow! Ooh. MAN: You take the next one, will you? [CLAUDE MOANING] I'm giving you one more chance. I don't know about you, Claude. I'm in desperate... - Did you say Claude? - I never said that. - Wait a minute. What...? - No. - Guy. Guy. It's you, Guy. - Absolutely no. Gaetano Proclo. The 5th division, special services, the Philippines. I was 4-F. I never served. No, no. It's me, Claude. Claude Perkins. Get away from me, Claude. That's right. Get-Away-From-Me Claude. [GRUNTS] We had an act together. A trio with Nelson Carpenter. We pantomimed to Andrews Sisters' records, remember? "Rum And Coca-Cola." [SINGING] The Andrews Sisters? I hate the Andrews Sisters. You hate the Andrews Sisters? Look, mister, I'm in desperate trouble and I wish you'd leave. Now get out. Wait till I write Nelson Carpenter about this. ABE [OVER P.A.]: 313 coming up. That is 313. You're not gonna believe what's coming up, boys. It's vivian. There are other fat fish in the ocean, Gaetano Proclo. And 313 may just be one of them. Not 313, Claude. Don't touch 313. Just not 313, Claude. [PHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE] Oh, I had a hunch it would be bad but nothing like this. - Welcome to the city morgue. - Aah! Oh, forget it, mister. That is not my scene. [GASPS] CLAUDE: Looking for 313? Right this way. [CLAUDE STAMMERING] I know it's this way. It's around the corridor. Here we go, 313, right... That's it. Jellyroll baby. You're my jellyroll man. [VIVIAN SCREAMING THEN THUD] [CLAUDE Mo ANS] You... I'm gonna kill you, you bastard. You son of a bitch, I'll break every goddamn bone in your... MAN 1 [oN RADIo]: - Or eight-track tapes. That's right, 500 all-time favorite super hits for only 9.95. MAN 2 [ON RADIO]: The first lady was in town... [GUNSHOT] CARMINE: My clothes. Somebody stole my clothes. Okay, Gaetano, I know you're in here. I'm gonna find you, if it's the last thing I do. CLAUDE: All right, all right, all right. Just lie there like a beached whale. Look, I'd love to stay here and play Sleeping Beauty with you... ...but I've gotta get ready for the talent contest. What's in the bag? You bring your own lunch? What becomes a legend most? [SINGING] [APPLAUSE] Thank you. ABE [OVER P.A.]: Just a reminder, it is amateur night at the Ritz. Oh, well, you can say that again. Brick. Oh, hi, there, Bunny. How's tricks? Hey, listen, is that thing loaded? You're lucky I'm not using it on you. Where is he? - Who? - My brother-in-law, dick. He was just here. - And? - He went right in there. All right, get out of here. Get out of here. CLAUDE: Oh! - Who is it? - You know goddamn well who it is. [CLAUDE SQUEALS] Jellyroll baby, you're my jell... Get out of here, you son of a bitch. Get out of here. Get out of here. Okay, Gaetano, the jig's up. [MOANING] CARMINE: Vivian? Vivian, baby, what have they done to you? Sis, speak to me. Those crazy fairies. They molested my sister. Oh, you crazy fairies, I'm gonna kill you. I'll kill every last one of you. Where are you? No. No. [MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX] - Your brother-in-law means business. - What do you think I'm doing here? CHRIS: You just gonna sit there? - What's the use? Well, wear a disguise. I am. I thought you were mad at me. I am, but I prefer you alive to dead. I'm funny that way. - Claude. - Oh, sure, now you know me. PROCLO: You gotta help me. I am entered in a talent contest. I've gotta get ready. My brother-in-law is here with a gun. DSo that's who that maniac was. [GUNSHoT] CARMINE: Brick, where are you? - Look out. CARMINE: I'm gonna get you. Come on out now. I'll get you. [GUNSHOT] VIVIAN: Carmine, no. No. CARMINE: All right, I'm coming. VIVIAN: No. Carmine. No! - No. No! - What is it? - What is it? - No. - What is it? - My mink. - Your mink? - They've taken it. Now, here's the plan. You've gotta be Nelson Carpenter. - Who? - One of the Andrews Sisters. Nelson Carpenter was one of the Andrews Sisters? It's a routine. I don't know any Andrews Sisters' routine. Neither did he. Nelson and I carried you. It'll never work. [CARMINE GRUNTING THEN CLAUDE SQUEALS] [GUNSHOT] CLAUDE: He'll never catch us down there. CARMINE: You'll have wings. [WHISTLES] Get in here and don't let anyone out. Yeah? [MOUTHING DIALOGUE] Hold it. [DOOR OPENS] [SINGING] [YAWNING] [APPLAUSE] GOOGIE: That was Guido Cohen singing "vesti La Giubba"... ...from Pagliacci. GUIDo: Terrible. Don't be silly, you were wonderful. GOOGIE: Bravo, Guido, bravo. Oh, it's going to be a close race tonight. Our next contestant is Mr. Sheldon Farethold. Song stylist from north New Jersey. - Here I go. GOOGIE: Here he is. Sheldon. [MUSIC PLAYING] Huh? [LIP-SYNCING] Well, it's arbitrary. Hey, Tony, take a look. [MEN CHUCKLING] I like the one in fur. MAN: It looks terrific. Come on out, you fat slob. Gaetano, I know you're in here. Where are you? Expose yourself. Oh, Jesus, no. [GRUNTING] - Come on. - Come on, girl. - Come on, girls. PIE: Come on, honey, take it off. Shake it, fat man. Shake it, baby. [GUNSHOTS] - Come on. What's happening? - Get away from me. - Get out. - Come here. Come here. Hide. Everybody, slow down. Nobody's going nowhere. And give me some lights. I wanna see who I'm talking to. Not on me, you dumb fruit. I want the room lights. Okay. I want all the fairies in the pool. - What about us butch types, boss? - Shut up, you. It's me, Bunny, Brick. You're fired. Go on. Get in there. - Bunny, my hair. - Get in there. [CLAUDE SQUEAKING] Jesus, I can't believe it. A good-Iooking, rugged boy like you. - Believe what, sir? - I believe it. Get going. Come on. VIVIAN: Carmine, please. CARMINE: You shut up too, vivian. I just want my mink. You'll get your mink. Will you let me handle this? He's in here somewhere. JOEY: Wait a minute. All this because some fat woman who lost her mink? One more word out of you, you transvestitite... what did you call me? Careful, Googie. You make me see red, mister. And when I see red, I tear you apart. Shit. You think I'm scared of a little gun? [BELICIC AND HUGSNY NoT HUGGING] That's okay, mister. If you don't bother me, I don't bother you. CARMINE: All right, the rest of you in there. Get in there. Come on, in there. Come on, get in there. Get in there, all of you. CARMINE: All right, pool time, everybody. Come on, everybody. Come on. Come on. You listen to me, idiots. Seniors. I don't wanna see a dry fairy in the house. MAN 1: Oh, my mascara's running. MAN 2: Oh, God! MAN 3: It's running. MAN 1: What a night! MAN 2: My leg... Christ, another one. You really know how to mess up an act, you know that, mister? - You know what they call people like you? - Fashionable. - Get in there. Get in there. - All right, all right. Well, I guess that makes it you. Look at you! I could vomit. - Jesus, Mary and Joseph, is that her mink? - Yeah. CARMINE: All right, give it back. VIVIAN: I don't want it. That's not my Gaetano. I wanna go home. - Okay, Gaetano, the jig's up. - All right. Take the crap off. The wig, the glasses, the moustache, the mink. Everything. Okay. I want you all to meet my splendid brother-in-law, Gaetano Proclo. That's not Mr. Proclo. He is. - Who is? - You are. Who? Who? [CARMINE GRUNTING] PROCLO: Keep it quiet. I don't wanna hear that voice. [VIVIAN CRYING] Don't cry, viv. "Don't cry," he says. Look at him like that, telling me not to cry. Do you want your coat back? Oh, look at my husband, the man in the mink coat. Oh, I can't wait to go to bingo with you like that next week. But I won't be there, if God is merciful... ...because I'm gonna have a heart attack here. This is grounds for annulment, sis. I asked Father Catini. I don't want an annulment, I wanna die. [CHATTERING IN ITALIAN] Vivian. Vivian, what are you doing? You can't even swim. Don't. Well... ...is this what you wanted, Carmine? Boy, I can understand you hating me as a brother-in-law... ...but killing someone over a garbage company? [CHATTERING IN ITALIAN] You're married to a flaming homo, that's perche... [CHATTERING IN ITALIAN] - He came here tonight, didn't he? - A cab driver brought me here. Because you told him to. I never heard of this place. You see that, vivian? Even a cab driver knows what a fata he is. I just hope you're not gonna insist on mentioning this in confession. For my sake, for the children, please, don't tell about this. I wasn't planning to. It's just a phase you're going through. Last year, it was miniature golf. How the hell do you prove something like this to your own wife? Okay, Carmine, I give up. You win. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Get off of me. PROCLO: Don't splash. Don't splash. CARMINE: Get out of here, you pest. Get out of here. - Let's get out of here. - Vivian, wait. Don't you even speak to my sister. Come on, let's get out of here. Thirty-seven thousand, five hundred on the week. The rain killed us tonight, and next week we got the Jewish holidays coming up. Well, good night, boss. Who is that? Oh, it was just a person. - She called you "boss." - A lot of people call me boss. It's not what you're gonna think, vivian. "Vespucci Enterprises, Inc. Carmine vespucci, president." - This is a statement. - I was gonna tell you about it. VIVIAN: We own this place? - Papa done a lot of expanding. We own this place, Guy. He don't have to know. This isn't the place to talk about it. You knew what kind of place this was all the time. CARMINE: So did he. That's why he came here. I can't help it if we own it. It was just a coincidence. - What kind of a cab did you come in? - What? What kind of a cab did you come in? - It was the opera. Aida Cab. - Aida Cab. - We own that company. - We do? What did the driver look like, Guy? - All I remember about him is his stutter. - His stutter? - Yeah, he stuttered and smoked pot. - Cousin Tito. I should have guessed. It's gonna be very hard to forgive you for this. I don't want no forgiving. VIVIAN: Take the hit off of him, Carmine. - Vivian! - Take it off. - No. If you don't, I'm gonna tell Frankie... ...about you muscling in on the bingo at the feast of St. Anthony's. And he is gonna put a hit out on you and you're gonna be wearing cement shoes. There's gonna be more grief and less peace in our fucking family than there already is. - "Get Proclo." You heard Papa. - I got Proclo. Now, take it off, Carmine. I'll lose face. - Not under the East River. - Shit! Now, I wanna see you two forgive each other. [SPEAKING IN ITALIAN] [PROCLO SCOFFING] I wouldn't kiss him for a million dollars. That's exactly what's it's worth, Guy. - I wouldn't kiss him, period. - For me. For me. - Kiss. Kiss him. - Hmm? MAN 1: Yeah. MAN 2: Kiss him. MAN 3: Come on, kiss. Hey. VIVIAN: Kiss him, Carmine. [STAMMERING] PROCLO: Hey. MAN 1: Hey. MAN 2: Hey. MAN 3: Hey. MEN: Hey! [CARMINE SCREAMS THEN GRUNTS] [MEN CHEERING] You can go fangoo/ yourself, Carmine. It's people like you that belong in garbage. It's people like me that just marry into it. Get him out of here, men. Into the steam room, girls. [MEN SINGING] CARMINE: Hey, don't touch me. Don't touch me. Hey, you get your hands off me. ABE [o vER P.A.]: Okay, everybody. Tonight's talent contest has been won by Claude Perkins and partners. TIGER: We're sorry, Googie. You build someone up like that and it's all a lie. That is a low-down, dirty trick you've made. Hey, do you believe that? They told me Mr. Big was going to be here tonight. Who's Mr. Big? Who's Mr. Big? Only the man who produces miracles. A producer, who else? - My uncle's a producer, Miss Gomez. - Oh, yeah? - What's he produce? - Shows. Legitimate shows? I don't do no dirty stuff. Right now, I think he's casting Oklahoma for a dinner theater. Oklahoma. It's a stretch, but I could do that part. Listen, you could get me an audition with him? - Oh, sure thing. - Oh, good. I tell you what, I see you in Bimbi's across the street. We run into my boyfriend, Hector, we tell him you're my agent. I see you two skunks later. I thought you quit. That's show business. You really got an uncle who's in show business? Seymour Pippin. He's a producer. Forget it, mister. Come on, Tiger. CHRIS: I suppose you're wondering what happened to Bunny. Entered her in the Princess Margaret look-alike contest. First prize is a gay guide to Leningrad. We also called the 16th Precinct, they'll be right over for him. Hey, listen. Thanks for helping me tonight. Oh, you just let me know the next time you three are coming in. I wanna be sure not to be here. If you're ever in Cleveland, vivian makes a great lasagna. That's the best offer I've had all night. - Who was he talking about? - Carmine. Oh, you gotta do something for him. Don't worry, I will. VIVIAN: Promise me? - On Papa's grave. [SOBBING] Papa. PROCLO: Not your papa's, mine. Oh. VIVIAN: Come on, Guy, let's go. Don't tell me what... Get out of here. I wanna know... Look, I got friends... I walk in off the street, a guy pulls a... we'll go together. Hey, listen, I'm not a gay. Watch the hair. Come on, listen, will you guys? I got a wife and two kids. PROCLO: Oh, no. Viv, I've left my wallet in there. CHRIS: Orgy, orgy. They'll be an orgy in 340. THE END
