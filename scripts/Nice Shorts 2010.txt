So, let's begin! Where are we at? Come on, you can do better than that! You haven't been hospitalized for that long. Do you see this tree? We planted it with dad, remember? Yeah, you're right! Now, we are going to follow the sound coming from the playground. Listen for the sound, okay? Okay! Wait, there is something here and it feels rough. What is this? You know, that's the bumpy spot on the street near the stationery shop. lt means we are very close to the electric pole, so be careful you don't bump into it, okay? All right! ls it a puppy? How adorable it is! Guess what? Young-kwang used to be as cute as this back then. Bye, puppy! Come, Come! Corn is only a buck! Two mackerels for two bucks! Hey there, old miss, take a look at this fresh fish! Excuse me! What did you just call me? Who's old? Just give me one of those squid. Good choice! Eat this squid and get better, okay? Yes, sir! After this gust of wind, we are at the main street. Gosh! Be careful! Gosh, you have to stop before the speed bump! Sorry, it was too big to recognize. Now, remember! This is really important. You should always keep that in mind. You press the button for the audio signal? The red light is on. Please wait. lf you concentrate on the sound, you will see the crosswalk. l see. Did you see that? That's the same car as dad's! lmpressive! How did you know that? See? My ears are a little special. Herm Herm! Ding Dong! The green light is on. Please walk. Be careful. Stairs are ahead. Got it. Two tickets for the blind, please. Here you go. The screen door is open. Please watch your step. Hmm, how come the subway is all black? Oh, no-! Don't open your eyes yet! All right, all right! But still, why did you color it all black? Well, you know, l fell down to the railroad at the subway station once. lt was really scary and whenever l think of that moment, l feel black like hell. Oh, you poor thing. Let's get out of here! Yeah, let's get out! Finally, we are here! So, after all this, where are we now? Guess! Fine, just give me a moment. Um, l got it. lt's the Hill of Rose of Sharon we went to last time, isn't it? Nope! But it looks similar. Wow... it's really refreshing here. Look at the statue beside us. Let me see. Ah... lt looks like a fish or a man. The color is probably the same as the sea. Yep! You're right! A beautiful color like the sea in the evening. Wait! This is the hospital, isn't it? Good job! Let me see. This must be my little piggy, Young-kwang. And this one is... lt's been a while since we took a walk together. You're right. Shall we walk a little more? Hmm... okay! The door is closing. CAN YOU HEAR ME?! Doesn't it look the same as the real one? Let me touch it. How do you feel when you touch the real screen door? Obviously it's soft, but covered with a hell of a lot of dust. You stupid horse... You must be mad! Behead that stupid horse! GIRL Mr. Jo, someone's here to see you. Are you Bumsoo's father? What? You're Bumsoo's father, aren't you? l need some money. l said, l need some money. Mr. Jo! Come with me, please. Don't worry. l won't bother you again once l get rid of this baby. My parents think l'm at a makeup class. l have to go home before it gets too late. How far along are you? l'm not sure. Anyway, wouldn't it be better than finding a newborn baby at your doorstep one day? And you won't have to worry that some kid's going to show up some day looking for his daddy. By the way, how long has it been since Bumsoo joined the army? All men are the same, he ask me to shack up with him. And then when l get pregnant, he run away and join the army. Funny, isn't it? Did Bumsoo tell you where l was? He'd have to have a lot of nerve to try to get a hold of me. Bumsoo and l went to see you at the factory some time ago. l was afraid l wouldn't recognize you, l'm glad l found you. Did you stay with Bumsoo in Seoul? That's none of your business. You ask too many questions, l don't like it. Look, how do l know if the baby is Bumsoo's or some other guy's? And say it is Bumsoo's then what do l care whether you have the baby and live with him or not? You've made your bed, now go lie in it. lt's none of my affair. You don't really know Bumsoo. He doesn't know how to take responsibility for his own life. Well, you go tell him this. This kind of trick won't work on me. Let me give you a piece of advice, stay away from Bumsoo. He's nothing but trouble. Whatever. You're not going to just leave while l'm gone, are you? Just go. Could you do me a favor? See that guy over there? Give him this key in ten minutes. Give him the key in ten minutes, okay? Hey! Where are you going? l asked you where you're going. Come here. You can'tjust leave without saying anything. Get in. How can l help you? Read this and then fill out the form. This is the face and this is the body. lt's big? You came a little late. But the baby's position is all right. There won't be any problem with the procedure. So, have you decided yet? Stop. l'm sorry. - What are you doing? - l'm sorry. What do you think you're doing? Get up! Let's go. Leave me alone. We need to go. We need to go. l'm not going with you. What do you want from me? You're not my boyfriend. lt's not like you really care about me. lt's my baby and if l want to get rid of it, that's my business. Get out! Get the fuck out of here. While matching his steps l want to hold your hands And lean on your shoulder Thank you, l love you l'll give you happiness Kissing you, oh my love Chul-soo, l put on a 'hanbok' dress. Why? l want to bow. Why? l want to bow. lt's not even the New Lunar Year. Don't bow. DON'TSTEP OUTOF THE HOUSE Nine times one is nine. DON'TSTEP OUTOF THE HOUSE Nine times two is eighteen.

You have to finish it before the teacher comes. - Okay, ChuI-soo? - Dad, what's wrong? Give me the phone. l want to talk to Daddy, too. The spirit of this number's owner has been connected with the universe and scattered to uncountabIe pieces to the meaningIess point of no boundaries. Daddy's not coming today again? The owner has no more metaphysicaI weight and voIume. Chul-soo, when daddy comes l'm going to eat pork cutlet. You will? How many will you eat? Nine-hundred. l'm going to eat ten-thousand, one-hundred. l'm going to eat one-thousand million billion trillion. Okay, let's roll up the sleeves. As you know, the great Iight descended from the skies three weeks ago, and the worId was dominated by BeeIzebub. They have horns on their heads and some have taiIs and some don't. Like the sun, his existence itself can bend time and space. Our God can onIy... Who is this? l don't know. They followed him around and called him boss. You went outside? l can see them from the bathroom window. How did she see them? You have a guest. Dad! Somebody's here! Where's daddy? Be quiet. Soon-yee, never touch stuff like this, okay? You'll get hurt. Dad! Somebody's here! Who is it? Your fried chicken is here. You ordered chicken? l didn't order it. Ah, this isn't chicken. lt's sweet and sour pork. l didn't order it. Please go. So nobody ordered it, huh? l'm sorry but could you give me a glass of water? l'm so thirsty. Please. l'm so thirsty. Please open the door. No, please go. My dad said not to open the door. Liar. Your dad's not even home. Can't we just give him water? No, dad told me not to open the door. Please open the door. l'm so thirsty. Please. Then just drink the water and go. Of course. l'll leave in five minutes. Aren't you going to drink the water? l will later. Take off your shoes. - Who's that outside? - Huh? - l don't know. - Aren't they with you? No, l don't know them. Take off your shoes. lf you're not going to drink the water, then go! Sorry, l'm used to western etiquette. Telling me to take off my shoes... Aren't you being too violent? Never mind. Looks like l'll be staying longer than five minutes. Sons of bitches. Sons of bitches. Maeng-ku, stop. Son of a bitch. You're small enough to go in the car. Your mother must be differ... Think l don't have any friends? Leave! Or else l'll call the police! Come inside. There are no cops outside. You must have not gone outside. That's okay, nice kids... Come inside. No need to take off your shoes. lt was a girl? Why? You didn't see her before? l didn't. Why didn't you tell me? Why should l? Strange... - Sons of bitches. - What? Oh yeah, Maeng-ku has no manners. This place seems neat and tidy. So let's stay quietly and then leave. We'll see about whether we'll hunt or not. But do we have room in the car? lt seemed full. We can shove them in. Leave! - Sons of bitches. Sons of bitches. - He's telling us to leave. - Make the bird quiet. - Leave! l was trying to clean this but the bird keeps making noise. l told you to leave! Don't cry. You're so disrespectful. You're supposed to be polite at someone else's house. That was a mistake. Maeng-ku kept telling me that... He kept telling me that l'm a son of a bitch. Son of a bitch... l'm sorry. l wasn't trying to kill it. Maeng-ku kept telling me... Get up. Get up! What's wrong? Why can't you act right for once! Let's forget about the past. What's important is what goes on between us from now on. How old are you? Five years old? l bet you're ripe for a girl your age, huh? Misters. We'll be quiet. But you have to promise me when you'll leave. We'll leave soon. When? ln five minutes? You know what my nickname is? Hercules (tiny sausage). l was so worried about mine long time ago. lf there are big eggplants, then there are small sausages too, right? So if l put mine in a little, it won't hurt that much... Go away, you son of a bitch. Hey, you know how to fight? Come here. l'm sorry. Because of a sudden mistake, l killed your Maeng-ku. Hey, it's okay. No, l killed Maeng-ku. Hey, we were going to leave here in five minutes. Shit, but only three minutes have passed. lf l keep on like this, l won't be able to sleep tonight. We haven't slept in ten days. This is all thanks to beelzebub taking our load of sleep. Can't we use it? Use what? You know, that. You want us to use it? No. Know how disappointed our superiors would be if we used it on that bird? No. Cruel bastard. l think he's right about that. No. Five minutes have passed. Okay. But we have to inform our superiors about using it. We're obligated to do that at least. Mister, five minutes have passed. - This is an important matter! - Hey, what's wrong with you? l won't let you talk to her like that. Hello? Yes, it's me, sir. You remember me, right? lt's Raoh. The name from the ''Fist of the North Star''. l loaded all the ones we've hunted in the car. Hello? No, sir. l loaded them all in the car. Can we put the needle in Maeng-ku? Thank you. lndeed, the three-eyed masters all are truly magnificent. What about the girl? l was planning on doing just that. Yes. l will bring them quickly. l understand. Have a nice day. What are you going to do? Will Maeng-ku live again? Of course, l was also given this shot and came back... Liar. - This is very expensive. - No, just go. - The shot's price... - l don't have any money. What we need isn't money. l have to take that girl. Take who? That girl. What? Didn't you hear him? We're taking that girl for the price of the shot. No, you sons of bitches. All of you get out of here! lf you don't, l'll kill all of you! You don't need to get that angry. We're not going to take her and force her to work. We're going to dissect her, patch her up and bring her back. What's dissect? Leave or else l'll kill you all. Don't kill them. So what? Do l use the needle or not? Leave. Call daddy and tell him to hurry home. l don't know. l already gave it the shot. Good job. ls this the police? Mister Policeman, some guys came into our house. Yes. Yes. Mister. Mister. Yes? Are you Raoh? Why? He asked to talk to you. Hello? Yes, but the boy keeps threatening us, saying that he'll stab us and kill us. Can't we just leave? Yes. Yes, but if the boy doesn't want to... Yes, l understand. Hello? Hello? l love you. Bye. That boy over there. Over there. He said to kill him. Now let's pick who does it. Rock, paper, scissors. What?

Hands on your back. Okay. Nine times. Moron. - Take her... - What? Take her... What? l can't hear you. What are you saying? Take her away. l'll use the rag for a sec. How could you walk around with your shoes on? Wait for me! There's no use for that. Not many know the fundamentaI truth just by watching it on teIevision. There is a big difference between understanding the truth and knowing it. Not being abIe to make a step out of one's brain is the fate of humans. To see what's outside, somebody wiII inflict pain... F, WiIheIm, N from Germany didn't go out of his brain. Isn't it because he couIdn't feeI that it had any meaning to him? For exampIe, for an oId Iady running a supermarket in the countryside doesn't stuff Iike a superstring theory have no meaning to her? Because it has no meaning is frightening. The truth is perfectIy aIienated. A moraI phenomenon doesn't exist. Existing is onIy a moraI interpretation of phenomenon. Humans aIways hide their bodies in the shade of one's views and custom. Ration and instinct have a common goaI. Through good it is attaining god... You have a guest. You have a guest. They said there's no room in the car. Chul-soo.
