No one ever crosses that river... because beyond that is the Mutier escarpment. I'm afraid you're wasting your time with him. He's working himself into a juju. All right, Riano. Take him away. Very helpful, I don't think. Always the same old tales. Mutier escarpment too strong, too high. What they mean is if the elephants have a burial place... that's the elephants' business, and we've no right to butt in. - Perhaps we haven't. - What? And let $1,000,000 of ivory go to rot under the earth? Just how keen are you on this idea? It means escape from this cursed hole. - I'm keen, all right. - So am I. Excuse me, miss. Can I help you? I'm Mrs. Cutten. Mrs. Dr. Cutten. How do you do? Thank you so much. I'm looking for my father. I can't think why he isn't here. I cabled him. My name's Parker. Jane Parker. - Excuse me. Did you say Miss Parker? - Yes. How exciting. What a good chance we came down here. Why, this is Mr. Holt, your father's partner. - How do you do? - What marvelous luck. How do you do? He's still here, my father? - He hasn't gone away or anything? - No, he hasn't gone. You caught him just in time. Shall we walk along together this way, then? - What about your baggage? - It's here. - I'll take care of it. - I forgot my sketching paper. - Will you bring it along? - Yes, of course. Shall we start now? It's just a few steps along. You see that big building on the right? - How is my father? - He's very well. He's always well. - You're not letting your hair grow again? - I beg your pardon. I didn't hear you. I wonder if I could get that haircut, but the doctor hates old fashions. Here we are. I don't want to butt in. - If you'd rather see your father alone... - Yes, I would. I see. If there's anything that you want, let me know. - In a community like this... - Thank you. Perhaps I shall see you this afternoon. Come over to have a cup of tea... Hello. Jane. Whatever... What on earth. Darling, don't ask questions. Don't do anything. Just be glad to see me. What's this mean, dear? You're crying. You mustn't do that. No, but you're going to have to wait till I get through. There. There. All through. Let me look at you. You're just the same. Yes, but a bit more grizzled and moth-eaten. That's only because you've been missing me. - You have been missing me, haven't you? - Missing you, my darling. That's better. Now say you're glad to see me, or I shall go right back. I'm afraid you'll have to do that in any case. Shall I? Listen, Dad, from now on, I'm through with civilization. I'm going to be a savage just like you. We'll talk about that later. Now let me have a look at you. Attractive. Mighty attractive. I don't know how I managed it. Cable for you, sir. Just came in by the boat. Hello, Beamish. See who's arrived. It isn't. It is. Knock me for a row at ninepins if it isn't little Miss Jane. Hello, Beamish, old boy. But I say, what brings you to this awful hole? That's a perfect criticism of Africa. - What's the cable, darling? - From you to say you arrive today. I call that perfect service. Hello, Holt. What do you say to this for a surprise? - My daughter, Mr. Holt. - We have already met. He was kind and got my baggage. Did you find it? - I did. - Tell them to bring them in here. - Here? - Yes. I'll show you where to put them. Boy, put this down here. The dressing case down there. And put those trunks somewhere around here. That's grand. Just pile them up wherever you can find room. Look, you can just leave those there, anywhere. - Yeah, that's fine. - Good heavens. I told you I'd come to stay. But what have you got in there in all that? Just the necessaries of life. Can I get you a nice cup of tea, miss? Isn't that English? I come 6,000 miles and all I'm offered is a cup of tea. What's wrong with a drink? All right, I'll get you one. - Shall I send the rest of the baggage? - What? I like your Mr. Holt. He's nice. Don't you? - Six big... - What? I was talking about Mr. Holt. Yes, he's a nice fellow. We get along splendidly. He hates Africa, too. - Hates Africa? - Yes. - I don't believe it. - Why not? He's too strong and sturdy-looking, like you. - I don't like Africa, either. - I don't believe that, either. Yes, I think I'd better be... Darling, don't be silly. You're not embarrassed by me. Why, you've bathed me sometimes... and very nearly spanked me, too, several times. Very nearly. Perhaps if you actually had, I wouldn't be so obstinate. And I am very obstinate. - What are you trying to do? - Clean my face. - But what's wrong with soap and water? - Everything, darling. Must preserve that schoolgirl complexion. What's that? Who are they? The Wakumbas. - The ones with the big hats, who are they? - No, they're Kabaranda. There are a couple of hundred ostrich feathers... in each of those headdresses. What you might call putting a feather in your cap with a vengeance. - What are they doing here? - They come to trade. All right, let's trade them. You're butting into my business. Butting in? You're mistaken. I'm managing it. Beamish, bring me my hat. Do they always sing like that when they come to trade? That's not a song. They're invoking their gods to give them the best of the bargain. I don't blame them. Darling, you've done far too well out of one small store. I don't think it's quite nice. Look, here, young lady. I resent that. I must see your lady customers. It looks as if their shopping's been successful, anyhow. How women suffer to be beautiful. I see you're breaking into society. These are our very best people. I know. I feel quite out of fashion. Now let me show you what the well-dressed men are wearing. Those markings on the shield mean they're the foremost warriors of the tribe. Not really? Why, that little fellow there, he seems quite harmless. On the contrary. If you read his shield, it shows that he's killed five lions. - Really? - Or men. Yes, over here we have the Wakumbas. You'll notice that their dress is entirely different. And these natives here, are they of the same tribe? Yes, they are. Here's your hat. You'll be catching your death of sun. Thank you. Bit early for him to start dancing, isn't it? - Who? - The baby. Look at him. Jane, suppose we get a move on. - You do think I'm a child, don't you? - No, I've ample proof that you're not. Look, every man his own feather duster. Who are they? The council of the Aloas. Say, Parker, there's old Chief Oomtelli. Possibly he can tell us about the Mutier escarpment. Not a chance, Holt. I've been trying him for years. Darling, what is this Mutier escarpment? When they get past this falderal... let's hope they'll be in a mood for substantial trading. - Come on. - Let's get along. Father, you still haven't told me about the Mutier escarpment. Remember my telling you a fairytale about the elephants? Hundreds. Which one? The one about why one never finds a dead elephant in the jungle. Let me think. Why, of course. I remember. An elephant can always tell when death is coming for him... and when he hears the call... there's a secret place to which he wanders. A place where he can lay his bones with his ancestors. - A place of rest. - That's it. The secret graveyard of the elephants. Somewhere to the east, there's a mysterious barrier of mountains... called the Mutier escarpment. And the natives won't say where that Mutier escarpment is. It's sacred. Taboo. If one of them is found even to have looked at it... he's put to death by the witch man of the tribe. Now, Holt and I believe... that beyond that Mutier escarpment somewhere... lies the burial place of the elephants. You do? But why? Of course. Ivory. Enough ivory to supply the world. There's a 1,000,000 for the man who finds it. - And how much do I get for helping you? - You're not going to help. You can't. Mr. Holt, I know you'll understand. I do want to go so terribly. I think if she wants to go as much as all that... she won't be a hindrance. I think you're probably the nicest man I ever met. Anyone's nice who gives in to you. You disagreeable old darling. I'm mad about you. Leave me alone. I'm not used to this. Can you shoot? Like an angel. Riano, let me have that rifle. - Beamish. - Yes, miss? Hat. Satisfied? Quite. I'm tired. I'm going to turn in. Good night, Holt. Good night, my girl. - Good night, Dad. - Sleep well. Tell me, am I a nuisance? Do I get in the way at all? Not in the least. You've shaken down to it marvelously. - Better put this around your shoulders. - Thanks. The altitude plays funny tricks with the temperature. I'm not cold. You may think you're not. - You're very silent. - I feel very silent. You know, Jane... I'm not a romantic sort of a person or anything like that... but if we get through this all right... is there any kind of a chance for me? With me? I don't know. I haven't thought about it much. Will you? I thought I hated this country. Since you're here I almost love it. Do you, Harry? - I'm very glad. - Are you? Glad you like Africa. Oh, poof. Now you're laughing at me. A little bit, perhaps. But very tenderly. - Old man hyena sounds pretty lively. - Horrible noise, isn't it? Yet, I don't know. It's part of it all. - Love it, don't you? - Love it. Who wouldn't? Look. Isn't it marvelous? And the funny part is I feel so completely at home. Really? Good night, Harry. Funny little hand... so capable and so strong... and yet, so soft and so white. Don't crush it, Harry. I might want to use it again. I'm sorry. Good night, dear. Sleep soundly. Soundly? With all this noise? Isn't he grand? So proud, so fierce, and yet, so infinitely soothing. Why, there's another one quite close. Yes, much too close. Keep a man on the fire all night. Keep them going. Yes, bwana. Hello. Must be a village near here somewhere. That drum doesn't seem stationary. It seems to be coming closer. - It is. - Help, bwana! What was that? Didn't sound like an animal. Hold it there. Get him some water. - He say he look at Mutier escarpment. - Mutier escarpment? Make him tell you which direction. Where? Did you get that? We have to get him under cover. Head back to your fires. - What's the matter? - They're after him. They're close. Who are they, Harry? What did he say? He's looking for some fellow that's broken the big law of the tribe. No man's passed here. We should have seen him. I told him that. - They're like evil ghosts. - Those are the Ubangis... one of the most feared and courageous tribes. Yet they're afraid of the Mutier escarpment. It may not be fear. It may be superstition. To some of them, the elephant is sacred even alive. How much more so in death? - Have they gone? - Far enough. One good turn deserves another. He'll tell us now. Come on, get up. He's dead. Anyone would die who look at Mutier escarpment. Poor fellow. - He died too soon. - Did he? I wonder. He was crazy with fear, yet he managed to point. And that's the direction in which he pointed. And that's the Mutier escarpment, eh? Yeah, and all we've got to do now is climb it. Mother Earth must have some very particular secret up there... putting up a wall like that. Here. - Why? Is this going to be dangerous? - No. All has to be done according to Hoyle, though. Look out back there. It's a bit tricky here. You all right, Jane? At the moment. Be careful. Steady, Jane. Don't lose your nerve. We're all right. What was in that pack, Parker? Medicines, trade goods. Poor devil. That's too bad. I don't suppose it could be helped. You all right, now? Yeah, I'm all right. How are the rest of the boys? - All right, bwana. - All right. Start them going. Now, Jane, take it easy. Easy now. Give me your hand. Hold her, Holt! - Parker. Riano. - Yes, bwana. Quiet, now. All right. - Give me your hand. - Easy, now. Give me your hand, dear. Good girl! Aren't I a fool, Harry? I'm sorry. I'll promise to forgive you if you don't do it again. Would you like to sit down and rest for a while? No, really. I'd rather go on. - You're quite sure? - Sure. Good girl. Come on. - How are the rest of the boys, Riano? - All right, bwana. I don't think we need this anymore. Let me help you. Darling, you mind if I flop for a little while? It'd do us all good to flop for a little while. Anything you want? Yes, a nice hot bath. What was that? Can't say. - What do you make of it, Riano? - Maybe hyena, bwana. Maybe. Come on. - That was a human cry. - Human? Say, Parker, how do you feel about... - going on? - I've had enough. I know why you're saying that. And I'm not going to be made an encumbrance of. I'm not frightened of a few weird cries. Now let's get that ivory. - Riano, come on. - Yes, master. - All right, Riano, come on. - Yes, bwana. - What's the matter? - Boys scared, bwana. You've got your whip. Give them something else to think about. - Let's be on our way, come on. - Quick. Another barrier. Does that mean we lose the elephant tracks? Yes, but with good luck we'll pick them up on the other side. Hold on. My gun. They may be tough customers. Father, without prejudice... would you say that was a friendly noise? I'm afraid we're intruding. - Riano, you better get the boys back. - Yes, bwana. Gently, dear. Slowly. Look out. We're in for it. Gently, Jane. The river's alive with them. The dying elephant has to swim this. Look there. I'll feel much better when we've put all this behind us. Rafts? - Riano. - Yes, bwana? Cut wood for rafts. Two. Father, look. How's that for a touching domestic scene? You can't tell me she's dangerous. Dangerous? I'd hate to interfere with that child of hers. - How are they getting on? - All right, I guess. Come on, Riano. We can't be here all day. And the long one. There we are. - Come here. - Give me your hand. - All right, Riano. Push off. - Yes, bwana. Harry, aren't you coming with us? The boys will need a little firsthand persuasion... in order to keep going. We'll be close all the way across. All right, Riano. Come on. Shove off. Watch the end here. I don't think we'll be able to pole a straight course. I'm willing to detour. After all, they live here. Get in the middle of the raft, Jane, and stay there. All right. I think they're just curious, don't you? I hope so. - Riano, gun. - Yes, master. - Getting nervous, Jane? - No, not a bit. Don't shoot wildly, Jane. Get them around the ears, otherwise you just tickle them... - then they're dangerous. - I know, Harry. I'll try. - Get him? - I think so. I hope so. - We'll take the lead, Riano. - Yes, bwana. Come on, boys. Pole faster. - Still like it, Jane? - I'm crazy about it. No, I'm crazy to have brought you here. Why, Father, they look just like catfish on a rainy day. Good girl! Kill him, Holt. I missed him. Stop poling. Hold up, Parker. They're getting too thick. Stay, boys, stop poling now. What's the matter? - Fire, Harry, fire. - I can't. My gun's jammed. Get him, Holt. Get going before he comes back. All right, now. Hurry. Come on, boys. Push this. Harry, look out! He's going under your raft! Watch out, Holt. He's coming up underneath you. Hurry, boys. Pole quicker. Pole away to the other end. Never mind me. Help this boy here. Is he on? It's too late to do anything about him. Look out, boys. Here comes the herd. Pole for shore. Come on. Let me have your hand, Jane. - Again, Holt. - Right. Here we are now. Father, come on. Give me a hand. Get back in there. Come on, Riano, let me have a gun. They're still coming, Parker. Don't shoot. They'll stampede. That was friendly of someone. - Riano, who else is gone? - Musaki gone, bwana. - That cry we heard from the river. - Yes, it must have been. You get the boys to make camp here. I'll go see if I can pick up the trail. - Harry, don't get lost. - I'll try not to. Thanks. Tooch, you come along with me. Come on, Jane. We'll get a little bit further from the river. Make way, boys. - Good. We'll camp here, Riano. - Yes, bwana. Put one tent there... a couple here. - You boys can camp up there. - Yes, bwana. What was that? Ape. Look. White, too. Father, that cry. Father, look. Hello there. Come down. Riano, you speak to him. He can't understand. Call one of the boys. Try another dialect. Come down, I tell you, or I'll shoot. I don't think he even knows what a gun is. After him, Riano, or we'll have the whole tribe on us. Where'd they go, Riano? Jane, you'd better stick close to us. Jane, where are you? Answer me, Jane. - Parker. - Why don't you answer? - Jane, where are you? - Parker. What's the matter, Parker? - Jane. He's taken her. - What are you talking about? Don't let me go. Hold onto me. He's come to get me! Don't let him take me! Let me... Don't. Let me go. Let me go, you wild beast! Get off me! Let go! Stop! Let me go, you brute. Take your hands off me. Take him away. Thank you. - Thank you for protecting me. - Me? I said, thank you for protecting me. - Me. - No. - I'm only me for me. - Me. No. To you, I'm you. You. No. I'm Jane Parker. Understand? Jane. Yes. Jane. You? And you? - You. - Tarzan. That's right. Please stop. Let me go. I can't bear this. What's the use? Yes. I am hungry. Hungry. Tarzan, where are you going? Tarzan, don't go without me. I'm afraid of her. Tarzan, take me with you. Wait. I'm coming. Jane! Hello! Father, here I am! Here in the tree! I'm here. Father. Hold it. Father, here I am. Here in the tree. Bwana, look there. All right, Jane. We're coming. We're coming. Keep still now. Don't come down, dear. Stay where you are. We'll help you down. - Quick, Riano. Get up the tree. - Yes, bwana. Go, Riano. Look out for that big ape. Harry, don't shoot! There now. It's all right, dear. Don't cry. Get the boys together, and let's get away from here. Wait a minute, Parker. He may come back. No, let's go quickly, please. Hurry. All right. Come on, boys. You're in a queer mood, Jane. Yes, I know. It must have been a terrible shock. I've been reproaching myself all the time. Reproaching yourself? Why? My dear, you don't need to. What is it? - Were you very frightened? - At first. I thought he was a savage. Now I find out he wasn't. That's all. I can't make it out. How did he get here? What does it matter? He's happy and... At least he was until... Father, did you hear his cry when that ape was shot? - He'd probably never been unhappy before. - My dear, he's not like us. He's white. Whether white or not, those people, living a life like that... they've no emotions. - They're hardly human. - Human. He's human, all right. Riano, send some of the boys out for firewood. Am I interrupting anything serious? Jane's got a theory that you were wrong in killing that ape. - Wrong? - Cruel. To whom? To him. Why do you laugh, Harry? Isn't that the best thing to do? - Is it funny? - Funny? Extremely. That you should be considering the feelings of a man-ape. It's a pity I didn't put two bullets into him and finish the job. I wouldn't talk like that. Don't you think it's being melodramatic and absurd? - Absurd? - Extremely. Bwana, Mohammed dead in water. - How did it happen? - Riano find man's footprint in mud. You better call the rest of the boys back into camp. You don't think he did it? I don't know. Harry, you can't do that. - He isn't a wild animal. - He's a murderer. So were you to him when you killed that ape. We can't stay here and do nothing while he picks us off one by one. We've to make him understand we mean him no harm. - I could make him listen to me. - You can't even talk to him. I know I could make him understand me. Please let me try. - It's ridiculous. - Please let me try. It's worth it, Harry. Shall we risk it? - Perhaps if you think it's all right. Yes. - All right. Go on. You mustn't do that. You promised. Harry, let me speak to him. Harry, you mustn't. Bwana. Blood. I got him. Tarzan. Jane? I wish you'd knock before you enter my boudoir. I suppose you know that's going to make your head worse. - Head? - Yes, head. Head. That thick bit under your hair. No, Tarzan. Oh, dear. I really can't make you any more bandages. You'll get dizzy. You'll fall. You'll hurt yourself. Stop it at once. I'm not a bit amused. Tarzan. You see, you'll fall. Tarzan, where are you? Come up. Where are you? That wasn't a bit charming. It was just like a nasty, little boy. - Boy? - Yes. Please let me go. - Go? - Yes, go. - Go? - Yes. No. Don't let me go. Tarzan, don't. I didn't say dunk. I said don't. Tarzan, don't. Nice Tarzan. Take Jane bank. Yeah. Bank. Fooled you that time. Tarzan! Watch out! Help! Tarzan, save me! What was that? Where are you going? Don't take me up. Stop. Help, Tarzan. Don't. I think you're the most horrible man I ever knew. What color are your eyes? Yes, I know. The color of the forest. Gray-green. I wonder what you'd look like dressed. Pretty good. You'd be a great success in London... and I believe you'd love it. Or would you? Women are such fools. They'd spoil you. I don't think you'd better look at me like that. You're far too attractive. I love saying things to a man who can't understand... who doesn't even know what kisses are. Love it. I daresay you would. I think we'd better land. Bank. Land. Let go, Tarzan. Go under. Got you. Where are my boots? I do wish you wouldn't be so playful. Give me those boots. Tarzan, please give me those boots. Tarzan, let go of my foot. That hurt me. Don't be so funny. Now let go. All right. When you've quite finished, I'll put my boots on. Tarzan, you're tickling. Stop. - Love it? - No such thing. You can't get round me like that. There's quite a difference, isn't there? Do you like that difference? You've never seen anyone like me before, have you? Tarzan, where are you going? Don't go. Tarzan, please. - What's going on here? - Boys tired, bwana. Tired? Give me that thing. You tired? Is anybody else tired? Come on. What am I doing here... alone, with you? Perhaps I better not think too much about that. Just be here... be happy. And I am happy. Not a bit afraid. Not a bit sorry. I wish I could make you understand. Perhaps I can. Gradually. Come here. What are we going to do about us? - Us? - You and I. Darling, you got that right. Tarzan. Jane. Hurt me. Boy. Love it. Jane. Darling, that's quite a sentence. Tarzan, what is it? Riano, we'll camp here. - Yes, bwana. - What? You're not fit to go on. It's time you had a rest. - I'm the best judge of that. - Rest today. Go on tomorrow. - What's the good of tomorrow to me? - Tomorrow good like today. You can do what you like. I'm going on. Come on now, Parker. Just 10 minutes will refresh you. Come on. Please. Just 10 minutes, but no more. - All right. Riano, some water. - Yes, bwana. Those are tears, Tarzan. You've never seen tears before, have you? You know why they're there? We must say goodbye. I must go to him. Yes, I must. I can't do it. He loves me. Love? He loves me, too. I'm all he's got. - Goodbye. - Goodbye? Yes. Tarzan, don't look at me, not like that. If you do, I shan't be able to go, and I must. Don't you see? Goodbye, my dear. Why, he's brought me back. Daddy. There. You're all right, dear. Don't go! Come with us. We'll all go back together. Jane, dear, you belong to us, and he brought you back. Now you must let him go. - He belongs to the jungle. - Not now. He belongs to me. No, my child. Stay where you are. Not a move out of anyone. Can't stay here and be taken. If we resist, we'll be butchered. - Hand over your gun, Riano. - Yes, bwana. If we do nothing, we stand a better chance of getting away. Perhaps you're right. Are these pygmies? No, they're dwarves. Ready, Jane? Yes, I'm ready. - The drums are getting louder. - We're getting nearer. - Nearer what? - I wish I knew. Go to Tarzan, Cheetah! Give me your hand, dear. It's dark in here. - It is dark, isn't it? - Don't show any fear. I'll try not to. Father, stay close. Harry, look! Bwana! Why have we stopped? Is something wrong? Tarzan, what is it? Look, he's wounded. He wants them to change mounts. No, we must go on. But, Daddy, he's dying. I know. Our one chance... The elephants' graveyard. If he's dying, he'll take us there. But, Daddy, you can't. You're hurt. No, I'm all right. He's our one chance. Tarzan, we must go, too. Understand? Tarzan, with him. It's beautiful. Solemn and beautiful. We shouldn't be here. It's riches. Millions. Parker, it's true. We knew, didn't we? Father, what is it? We came this way once before. There's something sad about retracing. You've been very brave, Jane. He found what he was looking for. I know that somewhere, wherever the great hunters go, he's happy. I can't bear to let you say goodbye like this. Goodbye? You'll be coming back, Harry. I can see a huge safari with you at the head... bearing ivory down to the coast. Only this time, there'll be no danger... because we'll be there to protect you every step of the way.
