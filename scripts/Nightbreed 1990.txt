You know, just take off. Any place special? Somewhere we can be alone together. More alone than this? Yeah. No work, no telephone calls. - No bad dreams. - No bad dreams. Mmm... Decker's been calling again. When? All last week, every day. And what does he want? I don't know, I haven't talked to him. I haven't called him back. Well, if he can help... I'm just... so frustrated. You spend all that time working for somebody and... Look, go see him. Okay? Tell him it's all gone except the bad dreams. The dreams aren't even that bad anymore. I'm actually beginning to like them. That does sound crazy, now doesn't it? Boone. Aaron? It's Dr. Decker. Hey... long time, no speak. Four months. So you miss me? - I need to see you. - Why? I'm healthy. I'm feeling good. I'd like to believe that, I really would. So believe it, it's true. I'm still in my office, I'll wait for you. Oh, I uh, can't. I'm on my way out. Tomorrow then. Okay... Is something wrong? Don't let me down again. I'll be there. God help us both. 'Cause I like being fat because it's comfortable and I like myself fat. And I like you fat, too! Keep it down, you'll wake the munchkins! Mommy... Sweety, you're supposed to be beddy-byes! I heard something. What did you hear, honey? A bad man. Oh, everything's alright. You go back to bed, munchkin, and I'll come and see you a bit later, OK? OK. Boone! You've got a visitor. Wow... you look great. If I wasn't so dirty... I've gotta get to rehearsal. I don't need to see my baby sing, you know. Get one more car done and we'll see. I'm not going to be at home, so... why don't you meet me at the club, and we'll go to my place from there? OK? Yeah. You know, most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case like yours. But I found you intriguing. All that talk about monsters, and Midian. Only I didn't create 'em, I heard about 'em from other people. Yeah, but you've incorporated it into your private mythology. I guess I did. I needed a place to escape to. A place where all your sins would be forgiven. Yeah. Do you remember what sins? What do you mean? Well, when you imagined yourself being taken away to this... invented city, to Midian, what sins were you gonna be forgiven? Are we back in therapy, Doctor? They were just dreams. Midian doesn't exist. Monsters don't exist. But murder does, Aaron. Murder is very, very real. It might start in the mind... but then it changes to flesh and blood. Two days ago, the police brought me some photographs. They wanted to know if any of my patients was capable... of doing what's in those photographs. I'm gonna show them to you. Why? Because when you talked about murder on the tapes... I assumed it was just hallucination. That's what I assumed. What you described on those tapes, Aaron... was very detailed. Very specific. Houses, faces. These houses. These faces. No, I... I don't remember. Would you like to hear it? No. So you think I did this? Six families killed in ten months, Aaron. Oh, God... So what am I gonna do? You're gonna take these. They'll help you. You've got 24 hours to go to the police... and tell them the truth. And that's all I can give you. Boone? This is Boone. You know what to do. Adios. Yeah, hi, it's me. I'm at my place and I thought you were gonna be here. So come over as soon as you get this, OK? I love you... Bye. Take it easy. Take it easy. - What have you been taking tonight? - Lithium. Lucky you're in one piece, fella. This is not Lithium, my friend. What was I taking? It looks like it could be some kind of lab quality hallucinogen. You're on what we used to call a bad trip, ol' buddy. Six families killed in ten months, Aaron. Six families killed in ten months, Aaron. Please take me. Take me to Midian! Take me to Midian, I'll do anything! Have I missed you? Have I missed you? No. Please come. Please come. Please come. Come and take me. Take me to Midian! Please take me. Take me! Take me to Midian! Please, I beg you. I'll do anything. Why won't you come? What'd you say? I said shut up! They won't come while you're here. They won't show themselves to the likes of you. What'd you just say? What'd you just say? You said "Midian." Did I? Maybe. What do you know about it? It's where the monsters go. It takes away the pain. Hey, wait a minute... What do you know about it? They forgive you there. See, they only take you if you're worthy. You know what they do to those that... aren't worthy? Kkkkk! So you know where it is? You and I could go there. - They sent you. - What? They sent you to take me. Yes. But I need to know where it is. It's a test. Yes. Yes. North of Athabasca. East of Peace River. North of Dwyer. You'll take me. I'm worthy, you ask anyone! I knew you'd come. I was... I was waiting! Good. I know, I know, I know. I know. I know. First, I have to show you. That's how it works. - Show me what? - My true face. That's what these are for. I'm an actor, see? There's a face beneath this face. - No! - Let me! You have to see me! First I show you, then you take me with you! Juvenile delinquency, periodically institutionalized... some violent episodes. No criminal charges, and he's been in my care... - What the hell have you done? - Nothing! In there! They need help! What's he saying? He's not making a whole lot of sense. Something about a place called "Midian." He's dying. I think he wants to die. Inspector, I know Boone. I know how he talks, I know how he manipulates. Now, maybe if the right words are said to this man, they'll trigger something. Go ahead. I'll do what I can... but I'll have to have privacy. Move and I'll slit your throat! - You've got him? - I've got him. Holy shit! Are you from Midian? - We should take him below, Peloquin. - He's not Nightbreed. - He's natural. - No, I've killed people! I-I'm like you. That's why I'm here. Shut the fuck up. You're meat. If we eat him we break the law! That's true. Everything's true. God's an astronaut. Oz is over the rainbow. And Midian is where the monsters live. And you came to die. I didn't come to die. I came to be with you. No. Sorry. I can smell innocence... From 50 yards. I've killed people. I've killed 15 people! - Who told you that? - What do you mean? He lied, asshole! You're natural. That means... you're meat... for the beast. We mustn't! It's the law! Fuck the law. I want meat. Let him go! Peloquin, no! He's meat. He's meat! That way. The gate's that way! Run while you've still got legs! He's gone! Enough! What? Something... natural. Freeze! Aaron Boone, you're under arrest! Boone, listen to him. It's no use. Stay back! Inspector, I know how to talk to him. Boone, it's gonna be OK. They know everything now. I've explained everything to them. They're not gonna hurt you. I didn't do it. I didn't hurt anyone! - Of course you didn't. - Then you believe me? I believe you. He's got a gun! No! Hold your fire! I said hold your goddamn fire! Where's the gun? He reached into his jacket. Ms. Winston, can you identify this as the body of Aaron Boone? You know, you meant the world to Aaron. He used to talk about you all the time. He talked a lot about you, too. We don't have to do this right now, Ms. Winston. No, I'd really rather just get it over with. What was your relationship with the deceased? We were lovers. Deceased is male, white caucasian, late-20s. Possible cause of death multiple gunshot wounds to thoracic cavity and extremities. Unspecified animal bite adjacent bullet wound on upper left shoulder. Bullet wound number one, upper left shoulder. Second bullet wound above left nipple. Third bullet wound below costal margin, to the left. Jesus, they weren't taking any chances! He never raised a hand to me. He never hurt anyone in his life. Ms. Winston... everybody has a secret face. Coffee break. Sweet dreams. Where did he die? What was the name of the town? It was a place called Midian. Someone's taken the body! Is it always the same dream then? No, sometimes it's like I'm, uh... I don't know. It's like I'm underground. I'm in Midian, in a place full of monsters, being tortured by them. Are you buried alive? No. Not a lot. But you're conscious? Y-Yeah, but not alive. I'm dead but I'm still functioning. Death is the end, Boone. But in Midian, I live forever. So maybe death isn't the end, Doc. - What'll it be, darling? - Yeah, uh, draft. Draft coming up. I'm looking for a place called Midian. You're not the only one. Bunch of TV news folk passing through, ever since they nailed that baby slasher up there. - Baby slasher? - Yeah, been a hell of a week for us. Took 30 shots to bag that sucker. What is it? Men or money? Whenever I cry, it's usually men or money. A man. What'd he do? Leave? - Not exactly. - Well he didn't come back, did he? That's even worse. Some loser gets a crush on you, you could throw him in the river, tie him to a piano and he'd come back faster than a dog with a bone. Why I bother to look so good when there's no one here to admire the end product is beyond me. Know what I mean? Yeah, I can't argue with that. Do you want a drink? I want a drink. You know, I've seen men go to a lot of trouble to get rid of a girl but uh... I've gotta say this is the first time I've heard of a guy doing it when he was dead. They think some sick bastard stole the body. So, what, you want to go check out the place where he... checked out? I guess it's just a way to say goodbye. I loved him, but you know... I don't think I ever really understood him. Well listen, I'm not doing anything really important tomorrow. In fact, I'm not doing anything tomorrow. Why don't I drive up to this place with you and check it out? - You don't have to do that. - I know I don't have to do it but I want to. OK. Thanks. - I guess I'm gonna have to go. - Yeah, you go get some rest. I'm gonna stay down here and see if I can find me a good time. Who knows, maybe one of these jerks will win the lottery. Good luck. Compliments of the gent in the corner by the door. Well, isn't he just the picture of sophistication. You'll enjoy this. No, really. You hit me again and I'm gonna rip your face off. It's just a way to say welcome to the club. I'm not so sure I want to be in the club. You found your way back here for the same reason I did. We belong here. There's no place else on Earth that would take us in. Go on in. They're waiting for you. That's Lylesberg, the boss. - Who's that girl? - Shuna Sassi. Why? - I dreamt about her. - I dreamt him. - Who is your advocate? - I am. Have you tutored him in the law? - Yes, he has. - Let the advocate answer. Yes, I have. You understand what you do, joining us here? Tonight, you leave the natural world behind. The life you lived will be a dream. I know. The blood of Baphomet knows all truth. Are you prepared to be judged by the god? Yes. I am. Aaron Boone... the Tribes of the Moon embrace you. You were wonderful. Bon appetit. Hi. How's your head? Please... But it was worth it. Lori, my grandmother always used to say "Sheryl Ann, there's a man walking around out there with your name on his mind. All you gotta do is run into him." Of course he happened to be checked in here at the crossroads of the world? He's fabulous. His name is Curtis and he's a banker, and he's just moved to Edmonton since he got his divorce. And best of all, he thinks I'm wonderful. Sheryl, are you sure you want to come along? Oh yeah, I wouldn't miss it. Besides, Curtis has some business to do today. But um... But we're meeting tonight so that's okay. - My God! - Looks like the gold rush is over. Why the hell would Boone come out here? To get away from it all? Shut up, Sheryl Ann. Look, you go do whatever it is you have to do and I'll stay here and... do something else. Right, I'll see you later. So this is Midian. Curtis? What are you doing here? Hello, Sheryl Ann. Bring her. Please, bring her. Don't be frightened. Pick her up. O-Okay, hold still. Come on. It's okay. It's all right. Hurry, please. Bring her. Please, bring her to me. Pay no attention, just give her to me. What is this? - Babette, no! - What's happening? What, is it sick? - What's happening to it? - Mommy, help me. Jesus... - What the hell is this? - She likes to play outside. I tell her the sun will hurt her, but she's just a child. She doesn't understand. - She likes to play outside... - You saved her. I owe you something. Listen, I know why you've come. Is Boone here? Did somebody bring him here? Rachel, you have said too much already. But Lylesberg, she saved Babette. We know. But you cannot help her. Look... I don't know who you people are, but I saved the child's life, didn't I? So don't I deserve something for that? The child has no life to save. But what it has is yours, if you want it. That is the law. Do you want her? No! No thanks. No, I just want some answers. But to speak of this, to anyone, would bring dire consequences. What is that, a threat? Not to you. To us. What's below... remains below. This is the law. Boone. Aaron Boone. Just tell me, is he here? You took him. You took his body, didn't you? I need to know. Didn't you! I'm sorry. Please, don't go. Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Where'd they go? She's mine! Y'all come back now, y'hear!? Sheryl, we're going. I saw, uh... Something's kinda come up and, um, I... Sheryl? Oh my God. Oh my God. - Lori. - How do you know my name? Oh, that's a good question. Here's the answer. Boone's alive, Lori. And your death is gonna bring him out of hiding. Somebody help me! I'm not gonna let her die! You made an oath to obey the law. I'm not gonna let him butcher her. No! Bitch! - I love her. - But she's a Natural. She can't love you, not now. I don't care! Boone! Boone! Lie still... It's quicker that way. Decker! You're here. Well isn't this where the dead are supposed to go? But you're not dead. You're wrong, Decker. We're both dead. Boone. Don't you get it? Blades are no better than bullets. I'm dead. I'm the walking dead. Are you gonna kill him or not? Only I want his balls. And his eyes. Unless, of course, you want them? I think I'll pass. Remember me, Doctor? I was dying when you had your way with me. You made me give up my secrets when I was feeling particularly vulnerable. Now, is that a nice thing for a doctor to do? He's mine! Pretty sweet. No! I wasn't gonna hurt her. I only wanted to keep her warm. She's not gonna like the way you look. You've put us all in danger for your love of this woman. Decker won't tell anyone. He can still lead our enemies here. If he does, and Midian is unearthed you are responsible. I'll make amends. Just take the girl, then go on your way amongst the Naturals. That is the law. And who made this law? Baphomet made Midian. We've got visitors, boy. Can I use your phone? Yeah, uh, don't know if it works. Broke down, did ya? You ain't gonna get nobody to come out here. - Nobody never comes out here. - Get me Inspector Joyce. Dr. Philip Decker. You been up to Midian? - Kind of smelt like you had. - Where exactly is the town of Midian? There ain't no town, just cemetery. Joyce? Decker. Listen, I found out where Boone is. - Where are the nearest police? - Shere Neck. Shere Neck. Yes. I'll meet you in Shere Neck. - Who's buried in Midian? - Dead folk. Prospectors come from all over and got buried up there. - But there's something else. - Ain't nothin' but dead folk. Thanks. Had to happen sooner or later. They couldn't hide forever. It's all right, boy. It's all right. Everything's gonna be all right. Boone? What the hell is this? - It was Boone up there. - Yes. But Boone's dead, I saw him in the morgue. You still don't understand. You're below now, with the Nightbreed. - The last survivors of the great tribes. - OK, tribes of what? We're shape shifters. Freaks. Remains of races that your tribe have almost driven to extinction. - So you're not immortal? - Far from it. The sun can kill some of us, like Babette. Some of us can be shot down. Others can survive that because they've gone beyond death. This is too weird. To be able to fly? To be smoke? Or a wolf? To know the night and live in it, forever. That's not so bad. You call us monsters, but when you dream you dream of flying, and changing and living without death. You envy us. And what you envy... We destroy. Babette? Show her. Show her the past. We are all that remain. So you're saying... You're saying that Boone's like you. Yes. He's Nightbreed. No, that's not possible. I've gotta find him. - He's beyond your help. - Where did he go? Down to the tabernacle. To Baphomet. - Who's that? - The baptizer, who made Midian who called us here and saved us from our enemies. - OK, take me there. - It's forbidden. We'll see about that. - I told you everything I know. - No, no. The monsters. - Nightbreed? - Can they die? What harm they ever done to you? Can they die! - Yeah. - How? Well, there are all kinds of breed. All kinds of ways to kill them. Uh, b-bullets for some, and f-fire for others. Why is it that you know so much about them? I wanted to be one of them. Did they kick you out? Is that why you hate them so much? I'm not one of them. I'm here to destroy them. See, I've cleaned up a lot of breeders. Families like cesspools. Filth making filth, making filth. And I did it over, and over, and over again. But it was all leading me here. I was born to destroy Boone and the breed together. - You're crazy! - No, I'm death. Plain and simple. Say it! Then don't say it. - You may go no further. - Where's Boone? Boone is with Baphomet. He is beyond recall. Just tell me where the tabernacle is. I'll go get him myself. OK... I'm gonna go find Boone and I don't think you're gonna try and stop me. Excuse me. There goes the neighborhood. Looking for Boone? Boone? Boone! Dammit, Boone. No one here with that name. I know you. He's talked about you. Lori. Pretty little butterfly. Nice. You're still a Natural. - Wanna join the family? - No! Sooner or later, you'll want to live forever. No! - OK, Decker, what have you got? - I found Boone. Somebody stole the corpse, brought it down here? There is no corpse. He's not dead. He was shot full of bullets. I saw him. I saw it too, but he's alive. He's killed again. - In Shere Neck? - No. No, up in Midian. Gentlemen. Captain Eigerman. Inspector Joyce, Calgary Police Department. And this is Dr. Decker. And this is Shere Neck. Midian is my jurisdiction. Boone was my prisoner. We can work together. No we can't. I'll bring him in myself. - But he's not alone anymore. - I've heard that talk. It's nuthouse talk. - What talk? - Midian. Something is breeding there. Underneath the cemetery. Bullshit. - You believe that? - Yes I do. And if somebody doesn't stop them, there's gonna be a lot more bloodshed. I promise. Hey, you're very light on your feet. You may not be gorgeous, but you'll do for me. Hoppin' about already? - Just stay away from me. - Hey, I'm sorry about upstairs but I do see your pretty face and I just had to kiss it. - Hey, you can't go down there! - Why not? Isn't this a great place? Shangri-la on dope. We love it! What's that smell? Not me. The Berserkers are down there! Mad bastards... They'll rip off your head and shit down your neck! - Did Boone go down there? - And he won't be coming back. - He's not dead? - He's more than that. If you don't believe me, just wait until he comes to sniff a little blood! That'll bring out the beast in him! You can't go down there! You need some beauty sleep. Hey... Love those tattoos. Sailors. Help me. Get back here! Come back! Hey! Shine! Slaughter! You missed! - Where's Boone? - This way. Boone! Don't look. Don't look! Come on! Well well, guess he can't take the heat. Thank God. Let's go. I can't go out there. I belong here. Now listen to me. You belong with me. That's why you lived. That's why we both survived. Because we belong together. Don't you see they don't need you? Nobody needs you but me. I love you. Come on. There's no answer from the room. I tried twice. Huh? Yeah, the key's still here. I don't know, I haven't seen them. Arnie! Hey, Arnie! Where the fuck is he? Arnie! Listen, I'm gonna have to get someone back to you on that... OK. Yeah. Oh, shit. Oh God, what a mess. Gross me out. Arnie? OK, come on. I'll get my stuff in two minutes. - What's wrong? - Why's it so empty? Must be the rodeo. I smell blood. It's OK. Shere Neck Police. Boone! Next door... It was Decker. Decker did this. Boone, what's wrong? What is it? I don't want you to see. Get out! Boone, I'm not gonna leave you! Get in! Go! Go! They're coming! Go! Freeze! Up, up, up! Get him up! Christ, he stinks. What are you looking at? Move. Captain? You are a freak and a cannibal. And you've come to the wrong town. Get the door. I'm gonna give you something to remember me by. Fucking cannibal. Creep. Put him in my custody right now! - Still here, huh? - I'm gonna go back to Midian with you. Yeah... I'll be right there. Well I'm not going anywhere with you, I've got a press conference to deal with. You tell him I've got Boone under control. Don't trust him. He changes. Sure he does. Eigerman! - He was right about the motel. - So what? - So maybe there are others. - What are you talking about, monsters? A cult, I don't know. We should check it out. - You wanna go out there? - Yeah. - OK, we'll go out there. Pettine. - Yo Chief. You and some of the boys take Inspector Joyce here out to Midian. When you get out there, look around that graveyard. You see anything with more than two eyes, give me a holler. In the mean time I've got a press conference. Goodbye. Hey! Doctor's here to examine you, freak just so no one can say we laid one finger on you. He looks okay to me. What do you think, Doc? No pulse. - What's that? - The man is dead. Has Boone made a confession? They found traces of human flesh in his system. Does that answer your question? - Cannibalism? - Sounds like that, doesn't it sweetheart? Is this the same Aaron Boone that was shot down in Midian four days ago? What are you talking about? The man that was shot in Midian was Aaron Boone. Excuse me. What the hell are you trying to do to me!? I don't understand what the hell's going on around here! Now how many bullets did they pull out of that geek up in Midian? - Why? - Why? You tell him why! - I can't get a pulse on him. - Jesus Christ! Are you saying he's dead? Not lying down dead, my friend. Walkin' around in my fuckin' cell dead! Now what do you got to say about that? Christ. You can hide an army in here. - What exactly are we looking for, Sarge? - We're here to kick some major league butt. - We're here to scout, not engage. - What about if they engage us? What about that? There's people down there. I can feel it. Why don't we shoot them in their graves? Save us digging new ones. I don't know, maybe we're all just spooked. Who would want to live in a graveyard? What do you say, Inspector? Let's just call it a day. Head for home! No, no, no! Ahhh! You want we should interrogate it, Inspector? - Give him some air. - What the hell for? Can't you see there's something wrong with him? - Help me, please! - Get him off me! Get off me! - Jesus... - Christ on a crutch. He was just dust? It was the sun. The sun did it. We've got the perfect weapon, right over our heads. Yeah... Just until it goes down. Oh no. Shit! Pettine! Goddammit, get out here! Who did it? Pettine, what's your status? They torched our car! Lousy freaks! Kane, get in here. Yes, sir? I think it's about time we go out there, don't you? Reverend Ashberry, your services are required. He looks like a drunk. He is a drunk, lost his way the poor son of a bitch. Now you wouldn't want to miss the Judgment Day, would you? The Apocalypse? It's here? They're warming up for it over at Midian. What I want you to do is go over to your church, get crosses, and prayer books, and Bibles, and whatever the hell else you people use. 'Cause we're going out there with God on our side. Officer Kane, show him. OK. We've got your spankin' new H and K G3 .308 NATO semi-automatic assault rifle. Blowback action and retractable bipods. For standard combat firepower, can't beat it. For the sportsman in the crowd... we carry this handy pump-action Frenchie eliminator. This is the lightweight single barrel size. A perfect gift selection for ladies and juniors. That's fabulous, really. Terrific. You can always count on friendly garrote. Whether it's Commies, freaks or Third World Y-chromosome mutants, we are there. Sons of the free. Hey, freak-face, we found your pals. And they're gonna fry, just like you. Please, get in. - Rachel? - Lori, now. - What? - Close the door. OK, what? We have to get Boone back, Midian needs him. Why? What can he do? He went into Baphomet's chamber. He spoke to the baptizer. And survived. Nobody ever did that before. Maybe Baphomet told him something, something that could save Midian. Hey, Constable Labowitz, something to blow your brains? - Beauties. - All right! Suck on that. Hey, who's there? What's the problem? No problem! Shit! Hold him! You all right, Coback? Where is he? Where's Boone? Cell 3, through the door. I love a coward! Don't think you're getting sprung, freak! No way they get through that door, it's solid steel! You hear me, freak!? Jesus Christ! Ray! I do not want to hurt you. Naughty, naughty. - I want you to wait out here. - Brave girl. Boone? Stay away from me. I'll hurt you. I don't think so. Whatever you are, I'm not afraid of you. No time for hoochie-coochie. Are we going? So Moses spoke to the people saying, "Arm yourselves for war and let them go and take vengeance for the Lord" "...on Midian." "And so they burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt" "and killed the kings of Midian, both man and beast." Ooo, Doc, it sounds like we're going head-to-head with the Devil himself. - I don't believe in the Devil. - Oh, but you will. Alright, let's move in. Plastic explosives at every intersection. Tripwires outside the biggest tombs. Figure those will be the major escape routes. - How much time? - Five minutes. All right, pull back to the perimeter before we lose the light - ...there's movement underground. - Captain. Stop! Jesus, Reverend, not there. We've got claymores planted in the undergrowth. We've made a mistake. There's no evil. No, you're not listening to me! It's wrong, it's sacrilege! - This is holy ground! - Go back to the perimeter, you pinhead. You brought me here because I'm a man of God and... Hang around here any longer and you'll be sitting in his left hand. No you get the fuck out of here, you sorry son of a bitch. Claymore's gonna cut his nuts off faster than a hedge clipper. Move it! Move it, move it! Only a mile or two more. What are you doing here, Decker? You'll miss all the fun. There's a shortcut near here. - Where? - Now! Found it! I just... I just found something in there I really think you ought to take a look at. What the hell is this, Decker? T-minus ten seconds. Five... four... three... two... one... We are too late. Looks like the millennium just ended. Die, you fucker! Bastards. - Rachel! - Babette! Stay down. Stay where you are! - They're waiting for us above! - No! Don't listen to him or we'll all be slaughtered. - This is our home. - If you want to live, it won't be here. And it won't be by your laws. Now if we want to survive we've got to fight back, we can't hide anymore. Take the children above ground. Find a hiding place. What about Baphomet, can he be moved? Can he be moved!? - Yes, it could be done. - It must be done. Brothers and sisters... It is time to fight. Outstanding. Come on! - Don't look down. - Come on, hurry! Hurry! Women and children upstairs. - You heard what he said. - What chance have we got? - They're armed. - So am I. Come to daddy. You're with God now. Arm yourselves! Defend yourselves! You're not cattle for Christ sake. You're gonna need weapons, all of you. If you can't do it for yourselves, do it for your children. Come on! This way! No! Babette... Come on. Hey! My lucky day! Come on, she's just a kid! You found her. Look what we got here. Say goodnight. You've got to stop! There are children down there... You're killing children! Go ahead, faggot. Don't! Sorry, Padre. Eigerman! We don't like priests here. Get out. - Run! - No. I have to see. Take me with you. Ow! What the fuck is this? What is it? Kane! What in the hell are you doing down here? Your people need you! Baphomet is going to destroy us all. The Naturals, the Breed, Midian. - Everything! - How do you know? Take a look for yourself. The whole place is gonna blow? - It's Baphomet's will. - Look, we can make it out. - But we need fighters. - We're not warriors. - What about the Berserkers? - Madness, they're uncontrollable. Better yet, let them out. We are the Tribes of the Moon. You said so. The Tribes of the Moon. I'll release them. You take the big guy. Sucker. - You don't want to do that. - Gimme a good reason why not. I'll give you two. What a mess. Yo! Moses! Wait for it... Holy shit! Slop! You goddamn cowards! I'll kill you all! You! Gimme a weapon! Lori. I didn't believe in the prophecies. - It's all over. - What prophecies? You want to see? - That's Boone. - Yes, it's him. All these years waiting for a savior. He hasn't saved us. He's destroyed us. I made him. The bite... was mine. - The bite that mocks death. - That doesn't make him yours. Quite a dance, huh? Death everywhere and you and me in the middle. Come on! Come on! Boone! Not yet. One last dance? Oh my God. Decker's dead. Pull the knife out. No! Don't go. I have to. I'm responsible. You have destroyed our refuge. This was inevitable. No home is forever. You must rebuild what you've destroyed. You must find me... Heal me... Save me from my enemies. You are no longer Boone. You are Cabal. Save me from my enemies. Save me from my enemies. My God... What have you done! I've gotta start out tonight. I'll go with you. I belong to the Breed now. Then make me belong too. They made you one of them, you can do the same for me. I can't. But I want to be with you. I'll come back for you when I'm finished. When's that gonna be? When I'm 90 and you're still the way you are? I went through hell to find you and you're just... You're just gonna walk away. Just go, then. Just go. Get out of here! What do you want? Go! Boone. Lori, no! I lied. I'm sorry. You're all I want. Please, don't die. Then do something, dammit. Remember what you said. Lori? Please... Don't let it be too late. No... No! No! You said you'd never leave me. I saw their god. I saw him. I can still smell him. He's out there. Oh yes. - We'll go together. - No, they're mine. You got burned, mate. Now I'm burning back. All of 'em. Burn them all away. Take me with you. Who will come for us? His name is Cabal. He... unmade Midian. How soon? In the next wind. If not tonight, then tomorrow. On the next wind.
