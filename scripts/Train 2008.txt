Stay focused. It's fine. Stay focused. Come on. Yes. - How's she doing? - Sex and violence. That's what it's all about. Fuck. - Hey. - How'd your match go? I won. Shocker. American, no hard feelings, huh? You don't play fair. Oh, you're upset. Screw you, you uncircumcised little fuck. Here. My peace offering. What's that? A party. Here we celebrate after a match. The girls here go cray for American boys like you. All right. - Girls, huh? - Uh-huh. The train to Odessa leaves at 0100. I want all of you down here, full gear, by 06:30. We eat on the train, hmm? Hey, Coach, uh, listen... Shut up. When you win, you can talk. I want all of you up in your rooms, get into bed, lights out by 8:00. No bullshit. Mike and Chris. Beth and Jen. Todd and Sheldon. Claire and Alex. Night. - Thank you. - Get laid. So, you and me? Yeah. No, not gonna happen. All right? I'm only doing this for Alex. Baby, it was one match. You know you're better than her. You could easily tear her face off... ...if you wanted to. But what if I don't want to? Look... ...you are really, really good at this, you know? You can go pro. I just... I wanna be a doctor. You got pinned, that's all. I'm quitting the team. I know what you need. You need to learn the Todd Patterson... ...invincible double-leg double-hook throw. - What? - Go. Now spread your legs. Grab my neck. Spread again. - What? - Now pull me down. See? It works. Okay, you gotta let... Let go now. I'm coming up. I said spread'em. God, you are so beautiful. Blue eyes, do you always get this excited... ...when you pin someone? You betcha. Okay. Let's go. Come on. Freedom. Where do you think you're going, hmm? Ooh, look at that. Long after lights out. We just wanted to get some fresh air, that's all. Is that weed? We won't tell if you won't. Where are you really heading? - To get somefresh air. - To a party. - Bro. - Hey. It's a fresh-air party. Well, then... ...let's go. It should be straight ahead, one more block. Guys, where is this place? Uh, it's 'Kanyazborst' and... ...'Naza-vee-see-mostov' All right, thanks. Oh, my God. Dude, brace yourself. You're gonna kiss... ...my mother-fucking feet after this. Man, what have you done now, huh? Jesus. No. No, I can't do this. Hey, we should go. It's late. Did you have fun up there? Claire, come on. Claire. American, where are you going to? We're in the middle of the fun. Claire, you coming? No. She said I'll take care ofher. What the hell are you talking about, man, huh? - Claire, come on. - I say she stay. What's your problem? Claire. Get your fucking hands off me. Hey, we just wanna leave. You wanna fight, huh? You didn't get enough mat for breakfast? Todd... Todd, don't do this. American. Hey. Hey, why are you mad at me? I had no choice. Uh, yes, that's exactly what you had, a choice, and you chose to fight. You could have avoided this. Okay, wait. I think we're vey, vey close here. What time is it? You're all pathetic. Bunch of losers. You know what your problem is? You're not athletes. You have no idea what team spirit is. All you do is think about yourselves. Well, you know what? I hope last night was worth it, 'cause you just risked the entire tournament, not to mention your future. Coach, I'm so sory. And you. Odessa. We need to get to Odessa, the Ukraine. Odessa. Doesn't anybody speak English in this county? Is there a manager back there that speaks English? Eng... Odessa. Excuse me. I couldn't help but hear your predicament. I might have a solution for you. Oh, really? The train I'm on reaches Odessa. Can you please tell this... lady... ...what train you're on, so we can buy tickets for it? You can pay on board. That's how it works here on the smaller lines. Come on, get moving. You missed one train already. Let's go. Excuse me, friend. Are you the captain of this ship? Conductor Vasily Alexie at your service. Great. Well, we want to hitch a ride... ...with you to Odessa, me and my five guys. Welcome to Dosvidaniya. That means we'll show you to your compartments. Okay. Great. You two. Rad. Passports, please. What? Please give me your passport. Why? Many... - Stealers. - Steal... Stealers. - Thieves. - Yeah. Yes. Thieves. We save for you. Save. So gross. Nasty. I didn't even want you for this job. And what do you know about wrestling anyway, huh? You know what, though? I didn't judge you. I gave you a chance. And then you do this to me? Wait till Dean Edwards hears about this, my friend. And you know what? Even if we make the match, they're all drunk. Casino. Restaurant car, parlor. Oh, it's been remodeled and refurbished. God, this train has got to stop moving. I'm getting seasick. Shall I open the window? Let the ocean breeze swiftly waft through... ...and take away your mal de mer? Oh, shut up. If this stupid party, man, messes up... ...my chances for going pro... Hey. Are you listening? - Eveyword. - All right. Alex? Oh, my God. Hello? Is anybody there? What do you want? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. My face has this effect on people. I thought I was alone. May I? Uh, please. I... I didn't have a chance to thank you... ...for all you help back at the station. We will make it to Odessa in time? Even if we don't, the rest of our team will wait for us there, so... - Oh. - Yeah. Where are you going to or... or coming from? I'm going home. I don't like flying. Call me old-fashioned, but I love train rides. The only downside is... ...that sometimes gets... ...lonely. Lucky. Luck has nothing to do with it. English. Where you from? Maybe you should take it easy there... ...with the smoking, huh? Maybe it's not your fucking business. Deal you in? Um, is it even legal? Sometimes. Lucky for us. Oh, wait, wait. It's this one here. Hey, you're not gonna charge me... ...for this, are you? I read some stories... ...in that college regulation book... ...you won't believe. No. Good. Just relax. You wanna hear something funny? I don't even know your name, miss. Doctor. Dr. Velislava. What do I need a doctor for? Truth or dare, Claire? Kiss my ass, moron. You shouldn't have said anything. All right. You asked for it. Yeah. Yeah. Suck it all. My turn. Well... You have to ask, don't you? Truth or dare, geek? - Dare. - Take your shirt off. Oh, brother. Did those hurt? A little... for a second. Freak. It's kinda hot. Pain can be fun. You know, same nerves as pleasure. Truth. Okay. So who do you hook up with at the party? No one. Oh, come on, man. You disappeared for, like, an hour. Hey, don't be a jerk. So? No one. It's my turn, right? Mm-hmm. Truth or dare? Dare. Run to the end of the train and back. Okay. Naked. - There you go. - You'd like that, huh? That's fine. See? I don't have anything to hide. Better not let the coach catch you like that. He's going for it. All right. I think that'll be far enough. Oh, my God. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay. It's freezing. Be right back, guys. - No way. - Unbelievable. Oh, my God. Hi. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Damn it. Fuck. Guys, this isn't funny. Guys? Look, I... I don't want any trouble. Is anyone there? What do you want? Oh, shit. You don't want to do this. Stay away from me. Stay away. I'm warning you. Oh, God. He's not coming back. He's playing. He can't hide for too long, dick hanging out and all. I'm going to bed. Yeah, me, too. Looking for me? Uh, no. Todd's my best friend, but, uh, you won't tell. Good night. Todd? Todd, are you back here? You shouldn't be here. It's not safe for you in these cars. I'm sorry. I'm just looking for my boy Friend. There's no one here as you can see. That's the machine room. It's locked. No one can go in, not even me. Do you mind if I ask you, was he drinking? - Yeah. - Of course. This happens evey night here, believe me. - Yeah. - Come. I'll walk you back to your compartment. If you don't find him by morning, come to me. I will personally help you look for him. Stop. Oh, God. No. Let go of me. Okay. Todd. - Hey. - Willy? What are you doing here? Sorry. Coach locked the door. I couldn't get in. Have you seen Todd? Coach? Coach? I'm sure someone has a key. Real smooth. This proves nothing. He's probably off training his golden boy. Yeah, with his luggage and toothbrush. Excuse me. Todd? Hey, yo. Come on. Todd. Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing, huh? Let go. I'm looking for my boyfriend. Let go. Don't touch me. Let me... Let go. No, you look. This is not America. You're scaring the other passengers. If you don't stop, I'll confine you to a locked compartment. You said you'd help. And I will. Take her to her room and stay there. I'll have my crew search the train. That's all that I can do. Thank you. I'll be right back. Hey, the conductor said... ...wait. Bad boy. - Ow. - See? Got a point. - That's how it works. - That's how it works? - Yeah. - How's that? This is ridiculous. I'm gonna look for Todd. The guy said... You need to relax... Claire, stop, all right? He should be back by now. I'm not just gonna sit and wait. Well, the crew said... ...they were looking for him, right... What if they're not looking for him? What if the conductor sees you? He's not. Okay, wait. I'm coming. Fine, fine. Oh, my God. What the fuck is that? He's not in there. The conductor said that's the machine room. It's locked. Is that... blood? We need to get in there. Did you find... ...whatever it is you were looking for? I'm sorry. I was, um... I was actually bored, and I was looking for you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was, um... Don't wory. I won't hurt you. I'm gonna go now. Okay. Aren't you forgetting something? No, no. Oh, my God. I won't say a word, I promise. I won't say a word. No, you won't. What are you doing? Hold that. Careful. Fuck. - Here. - I got it. Is anyone there? Todd. Todd. Todd, I'm gonna get you out of here. It's okay. It's me. It's Willy. We're getting out. Okay. Okay. Come on. Alex. Alex. We have to get out of here, now. I'm not leaving him. Fuck. Help me. Don't just stand there. Help. Todd. What? What? Finish it. No. No. No. Finish it. I can't. No. Oh, God. Let's get out of here. Holy mother of God. Claire. Come on. Come on. Oh, Claire. Willy. Willy. - There's no time. - No. Come on. No. No. No. - What about Claire? - There's nothing we can do. We have to jump, now. The fall will kill us. He's coming. He's coming. Come on. Go. Go. Come on. Oh, shit. Come on. Go. Go. There's nobody there. No way. They were there. Oh, shit. Come. Let's not do this here. Are you just gonna fucking stand there? What the hell is wrong with you people? Why are you doing this? What do you want from us? Oh, fuck. No. Alex. Alex. No. No. No. Let go. No. No. Get off. What are you doing? No. Fucking... Wait, wait, wait. Keys, keys. Go. Run. Please help me. Please. Did you bring me more painkillers? I told the doctor that I'm in alot of pain. I think the liver is swelling... ...or my body's rejecting it, or I don't know what. But I do know that my family paid enough money... ...to give me a few more fucking painkillers. Do you even speak English? Hello? I need the police. Police? English? 'Politzia?' Willy. It's me. It'sAlex. - Alex? - Yeah. I'm gonna get you out of here. Oh, Jesus. Okay. All right. Careful. Easy, easy, easy. Okay. All right. All clear. All right. Careful. All right. All right, come on. Okay. You okay? Watch out. Oh, jeez. - All right. - I gotta... I gotta stop. All right. Here. Got it? Is that better? Yeah. Okay. Stay here, all right? I'll be right back. Please don't leave me alone. No, I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. I'm just gonna go and see... ...if we're walking in the right direction. I'll be right back. I don't want to die. We're not going to die. We're going home. We are? That's right. Fuck. Chicken shit. Come here. Wait. - Don't do this. - Don't come near me. We help people. Sick people. People who, without us, will die. What about my friends? If you do this, you're exactly like us. Maybe I am. No. No. Now spread your legs. See? It works. All right, guys. That's us. That's us. That's us. We're up. We're up. Are you sure you're up to do this? Let's go.
