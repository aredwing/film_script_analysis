WHAT AM I? WHAT AM I? MANY STRANGE AND WONDROUS LEGENDS EVOLVED FROM THE PURSUI OF LIFE'S MYSTERIES. WHERE AM I? WHERE AM I? BUT NONE IS STRANGER THAN THIS TALE OF THE MOST POWERFUL POKMON OF ALL. I AM READY... TO BE. WHERE...AM I? THIS--THIS IS NOT THE SAME. WAS EVERYTHING BEFORE JUST A DREAM? WHY? Female scientist: DOCTOR, LOOK AT THIS. Male scientist: WHAT? ITS BRAIN WAVES, THEY'RE SURGING! LET'S GO SEE! SHE'S RIGHT! Male scientist: LET'S RUN ANOTHER SCAN. ITS MIND IS RACING! THOSE VOICES... Male scientist: I HOPE WE DON'T LOSE THIS ONE. THEY'RE OUTSIDE... WE CAN'T LOSE THIS ONE. WHERE I MUST BE. OH! [ALARM SOUNDING] RADIO GIOVANNI'S HELICOPTER! TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENED! Male scientist: QUIET! LET US HEAR ITS PSYCHIC POWERS. PSYCHIC POWERS? FOR YEARS WE STRUGGLED TO SUCCESSFULLY CLONE A POKMON TO PROVE OUR THEORIES, BUT YOU'RE THE FIRS SPECIMEN TO SURVIVE. THAT IS MEW, THE RAREST OF ALL POKMON. FROM ITS DNA WE CREATED YOU--MEWTWO. MEWTWO? AM I ONLY A COPY? NOTHING BUT MEW'S SHADOW? YOU ARE GREATER THAN MEW, IMPROVED THROUGH THE POWER OF HUMAN INGENUITY. WE USED THE MOS ADVANCED TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP YOUR AWESOME PSYCHIC POWERS. SO, I AM SIMPLY THE END RESULT OF YOUR EXPERIMENT. WHAT BECOMES OF ME NOW THA YOUR EXPERIMENT IS OVER? OUR EXPERIMENT ISN'T OVER YET. IT'S JUST BEGINNING. NOW THE SERIOUS TESTING BEGINS. THESE HUMANS, THEY CARE NOTHING FOR ME. CONGRATULATIONS. WE'VE DONE IT. [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] IS THE NEW TANK READY? NO. WE'LL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A CAGE. CONGRATULATIONS. HA HA! EXCELLENT. WE'LL STAR OUR TESTING RIGHT AWAY. IS THAT MY PURPOSE? AM I JUST AN EXPERIMENT? A LABORATORY SPECIMEN? THIS CANNOT BE MY DESTINY. OH! AAH! AAH! AAH! WE DREAMED OF CREATING THE WORLD'S STRONGEST POKMON... AND WE SUCCEEDED. [HELICOPTER] BEHOLD MY POWERS. I AM THE STRONGES POKMON IN THE WORLD. STRONGER EVEN THAN MEW. THOSE FOOLS THOUGHT YOU WERE A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. BUT I, I SEE YOU AS A VALUABLE PARTNER. PARTNER? WITH YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS AND MY RESOURCES, TOGETHER WE CAN CONTROL THE WORLD. I DO NOT NEED YOUR HELP FOR THAT, HUMAN. A WILDFIRE DESTROYS EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH. IT WILL BE THE SAME WITH YOUR POWERS UNLESS YOU LEARN TO CONTROL THEM. I CAN HELP YOU DO THAT. HOW? TRUST ME, AND I'LL SHOW YOU A WAY TO FOCUS YOUR POWERS THAT WILL MAKE YOU INVINCIBLE. SHOW ME. [CHUCKLES] YOU SAY THIS ARMOR PROTECTS MY BODY, YET IT SUPPRESSES MY POWERS. YOUR POWERS ARE NO BEING SUPPRESSED. THEY'RE BEING FOCUSED. LEARN TO USE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR PURPOSE. WHAT IS THAT? PATIENCE, MY FRIEND. YOUR PURPOSE WILL BECOME CLEAR. [ONIX GROWLS] [SNAPS] [ROARS] SO, THIS IS MY POWER. [MOOING] [MOOING] I AM IN CONTROL NOW. ALAKAZAM! [GRUNTING] KAZAM! BUT WHY AM I HERE? NOW I FULLY PERCEIVE MY POWER. BUT WHAT IS MY PURPOSE? [FOOTSTEPS] Giovanni: TO SERVE YOUR MASTER. YOU WERE CREATED TO FIGHT FOR ME. THAT IS YOUR PURPOSE. THAT CANNOT BE. YOU SAID WE WERE PARTNERS. WE STOOD AS EQUALS. YOU WERE CREATED BY HUMANS TO OBEY HUMANS. YOU COULD NEVER BE OUR EQUAL. HUMANS MAY HAVE CREATED ME, BUT THEY WILL NEVER ENSLAVE ME! THIS CANNO BE MY DESTINY! STOP THIS NOW! I WAS NOT BORN OF POKMON. I WAS CREATED. AND MY CREATORS HAVE USED AND BETRAYED ME. SO, I STAND ALONE! AAH! WHO AM I? WHAT IS MY TRUE REASON FOR BEING? I WILL FIND MY OWN PURPOSE... AND PURGE THIS PLANE OF ALL WHO OPPOSE ME. HUMAN AND POKMON ALIKE. THE WORLD WILL HEED MY WARNING. THE REIGN OF MEWTWO WILL SOON BEGIN. Narrator: TODAY, ASH, BROCK, AND MISTY ARE TAKING A SHORT BREAK FROM THEIR POKMON ADVENTURES. AS ALWAYS, ASH IS DETERMINED TO BECOME A POKMON MASTER, AND, AS ALWAYS, HE'S READY TO ENDURE ANY HARDSHIP, BEAR ANY BURDEN WITH STRENGTH, STAMINA, AND A WILL OF STEEL. HUNGRY. NEED FOOD. OH, ASH. YOU HAVEN' DONE A THING ALL DAY. I'M TOO WEAK TO WORK, MISTY. I HAVEN'T EATEN SINCE BREAKFAST. OH. THIS LUNCH IS GONNA BE JUST PERFECT FOR YOU, ASH. IT'S MY LAZY-BOY NO-CHEW STEW. TOGE TOGE! PIKA?

I'M AFRAIDYOU'RE GONNA LOSE THIS ONE. ASH, YOU JUST SAID YOU WERE TOO WEAK TO WORK. THAT'S RIGHT, I AM TOO WEAK TO WORK, BUT A POKMON BATTLE ISN'T WORK. THAT'S PROGRESS.

I KNOW WE GOT TO GRAB SOME RARE POKMON FOR THE BOSS, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BAD IDEA IF WE GRABBED A LITTLE BITE TO EAT, WOULD IT? WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO STEAL A MEAL. I'D SETTLE FOR A TASTE OF THAT PIKA-CHOW. PIKA. PIKA. PIKA. SQUIRT. [GROANS] I'M STARVIN'. I CAN COOK SOMETHING. THANKS, BUT THE LAST TIME YOU COOKED, YOU WIPED OU 8 OF MY 9 LIVES. [ALL SIGH] PIKA PIKA...CHU! [CHUCKLES] [SQUEAKS] [SQUEAKS] HA HA HA! [CAWS] MASTER, SHALL I EXTEND AN INVITATION TO THESE TRAINERS AS WELL? AS YOU WISH. [GRUNTS] HUH? HUH? HUH? OHH! YEOW! AAH! AAH! SQUIRT! HEY, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE FLYIN'. HUH? SOMETHIN' FOR ME? HMM... Misty: WOW! GREETINGS, POKMON TRAINERS. I BEAR AN INVITATION. SHE'S REALLY SMALL, BUT REALLY PRETTY. YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO JOIN A SELECT GROUP OF POKMON TRAINERS AT A SPECIAL GATHERING. IT WILL BE HOSTED BY MY MASTER, THE WORLD'S GREATES POKMON TRAINER, AT HIS PALACE ON NEW ISLAND. A CHARTERED FERRY WILL LEAVE FROM OLD SHORE WHARF TO TAKE YOU TO THE ISLAND THIS AFTERNOON. ONLY TRAINERS WHO PRESENT THIS INVITATION WILL BE ADMITTED. IF YOU DECIDE TO ATTEND, YOU MUST REPLY AT ONCE. MY MASTER AWAITS YOU. UH, IS THERE A REWIND BUTTON? SHOULD WE GO? OF COURSE WE SHOULD! I'VE GOTTA MEET HER! I GUESS THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE TRAINER WANTS TO CHALLENGE ME TO A MATCH! PIKA. HMM? WELL, WE'VE GOTTA LET 'EM KNOW RIGHT AWAY. I'M SAYIN' YES. PIKA? TOGE.

SAVE YOUR ENERGY, WILL YA? THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL. P.A.: OFFICER JENNY, PLEASE REPOR TO THE FERRY ENTRANCE. OFFICER JENNY, TO THE FERRY ENTRANCE, PLEASE. TOGEPI'S TOTALLY SOAKED. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW FAS THE STORM CAME UP. AAH! HUH? WHAT? THE FERRY IS CANCELED? BUT I'VE GOT TO GE TO NEW ISLAND. YEAH, SO DO I. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? IT'S ONLY A LITTLE RAIN. IT'S MORE THAN JUST RAIN. THE HARBOR MANAGER THINKS THIS COULD BE THE WORST STORM EVER. LISTEN TO ME. THE PROPHETS HAVE PREDICTED THE RETURN OF THE WINDS OF WATER. FOR YEARS, I HAVE PRAYED THAT MANKIND WOULD NEVER WITNESS THAT DEADLY STORM EVER AGAIN. ISN'T THA JUST A LEGEND? THE ANCIENT WRITINGS TELL OF THE STORM WIPING OUT ALL BUT A FEW POKMON. IN THEIR SORROW, THE WATER OF THEIR TEARS SOMEHOW RESTORED THE LIVES LOST IN THE STORM. BUT THERE ARE NO POKMON TEARS TODAY. JUST WATERS WHICH NO ONE CAN SURVIVE. AND THAT'S WHY YOUR FERRY TO NEW ISLAND'S BEEN CANCELED. WELL, I'M GOING TO NEW ISLAND ANYWAY. ALL MY POKMON ARE WATER-TYPE. NO FAIR. WE'LL JUST SWIM OVER TO THAT PALACE. I WARN YOU, THE WAVES WILL BE SAVAGE. YOU WILL NEVER MAKE IT. AND BESIDES, IF YOU TRIED THAT STUN AND YOUR POKMON GOT HURT, YOU'D BE OUT OF LUCK, BECAUSE WE HAD TO CLOSE DOWN THE POKMON CENTER. UH, HOW COME? BECAUSE THE NURSE IN CHARGE OF THE CENTER DISAPPEARED LAST MONTH. AND IF ANY OF YOU SEE HER, PLEASE CONTACT ME AT ONCE. THAT'S A PICTURE OF HER OVER THERE ON THE WALL. MMM. SHE'S CUTE. HUH. SHE SURE LOOKS FAMILIAR. AAH! AAH! [ROARS] AAH! COME BACK HERE! OR I'LL PLACE YOU UNDER ARREST! DEWGONG-GONG. COME BACK! AAH! SOME TRAINERS HAVE NO FEAR. HUH? TO THEM, THIS IS JUS ONE MORE CHALLENGE. THEY FOLLOW THEIR HEARTS. THAT IS WHA SETS THEM APAR AND WILL MAKE THEM POKMON MASTERS. GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU. THE WORLD'S GREATES POKMON MASTER IS WAITING FOR ME. LET'S USE OUR POKMON TO GET TO THAT ISLAND. PIKA! ASH, OUR POKMON AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH. THEY CAN'T HANDLE GIANT WAVES LIKE THIS. GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. PIKA PIKA. [SCANDINAVIAN ACCENT] YOU VANT TO CROSS MAYBE? VE TAKE YOU,JA? VE VIKINGS ARE USED TO BIG VAVES. VE GET TO NEW ISLAND FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY FAHRVERNUGEN. STROKE! UHH!

THE BEARERS OF THIS INVITATION MAY BE ADMITTED TO NEW ISLAND. I KNEW I RECOGNIZED THAT FACE. WHAT? Brock: AREN'T YOU THE NURSE WHO'S MISSING FROM THE TREATMENT CENTER? YOU DO LOOK JUST LIKE HER. I FEAR YOU ARE MISTAKEN. I HAVE ALWAYS DWELT ON THIS ISLAND AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE SERVICE OF MY MASTER. PLEASE, COME THIS WAY. MY MASTER AWAITS YOUR ARRIVAL. UHH! UHH! UHH! UHH! MEW. MEW! MEW! MEW! MEW. MEW. UHH. HMM... HUH? [DOORS CREAK OPEN] NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE, ALL TRAINERS WORTHY OF AN AUDIENCE WITH MY MASTER ARE PRESENT. HUH? HUH? Wigglytuff: WIGGLY. WIGGLY. THERE'S ONLY 3 OF 'EM. AREN'T WE GOING TO WAIT FOR THE OTHERS? ONLY THE TRAINERS CAPABLE OF BRAVING THE STORM HAVE PROVEN THEMSELVES WORTHY IN MY MASTER'S EYES. DO YOU MEAN THAT STORM WAS SOME KIND OF TEST? PLEASE RELEASE YOUR POKMON FROM THEIR POKBALLS AND JOIN THE OTHERS. IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE MY MASTER'S INTENTIONS ARE CLEAR. HUH? HUH? HUH? LOCKED OUT. NOW WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF PARTY WE'RE MISSING. THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO CRASH THAT PARTY. YOU KNOW ANOTHER WAY IN? LOOK OVER THERE. HUH? AAH! BUT, JESSIE, HOW ARE WE GONNA SWIM UP THAT THING? PRETEND YOU'RE A CATFISH. HUH? HUH? SOMETHING WRONG, JESSIE? NO. COME ON. LET'S GET GOING. I THINK THIS PLAN'S ALL WET. PIKA. PI. [TOGEPI SQUEAKS] PSY-YI-YI DUCK. WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG?

[CHATTERING] Fergus: THOSE ARE MY POKMON. IT WAS NO PROBLEM GETTING THROUGH THAT STORM. I RODE OVER ON GYARADOS' BACK. WOW. I HEARD I TAKES A LOT OF SKILL TO TRAIN GYARADOS. YEAH. BUT ONCE YOU TRAIN IT, IT'S THE MOST DEPENDABLE POKMON THERE IS. [ROARS] YOU HAVEN'T ME MY POKMON. OVER THERE. [CHATTERING] [ALL YELL] [TRAINERS CHUCKLE] HUH? HUH? [SQUEAKS] PI? YOU ARE ABOUT TO MEET MY MASTER. THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOUR ENCOUNTER WITH THE GREATES POKMON MASTER ON EARTH. [ROARS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] PIKA. [SQUEAKS] [GROWLS] WHAT'S THAT? PIKA. HUH? HUH? HMM? HMM... [GRUNTS] AH. PIKA. AH. AH. YES, THE WORLD'S GREATEST POKMON MASTER IS ALSO THE MOS POWERFUL POKMON ON EARTH. THIS IS THE RULER OF NEW ISLAND AND SOON THE WHOLE WORLD. MEWTWO. MEWTWO. PIKA. A POKMON CAN'T BE A POKMON MASTER! NO WAY! Both: QUIET, HUMAN. FROM NOW ON I AM THE ONE WHO MAKES THE RULES. HOW'S IT TALKING? IT'S PSYCHIC. UHH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! HEE HEE HEE. AAH! AAH! AAH! WE'LL SHOW YOU! LET'S GO, GYARADOS! [ROARS] UHH! GYARADOS, HYPERBEAM ATTACK! [ROARS] OH! OH! OH! EEE! GYARADOS! Both: CHILD'S PLAY. YOUR USEFULNESS HAS ENDED. HUH? OHH. OHH. NURSE JOY! WHERE AM I? AND HOW IN THE WORLD DID I GET HERE? Mewtwo: YOU HAVE BEEN UNDER MY CONTROL. I TRANSPORTED YOU HERE FROM THE POKMON CENTER. YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF POKMON PHYSIOLOGY PROVED USEFUL FOR MY PLAN. AND NOW I HAVE CLEANSED YOUR TINY HUMAN BRAIN OF MEMORIES FROM THE PAST FEW WEEKS. WHO ARE YOU?! I AM THE NEW RULER OF THIS WORLD, THE MASTER OF HUMANS AND POKMON ALIKE. YOU'RE JUST A BULLY! PIKA! HMM? HMM? HMM? HUH? HMM? HUH? HMM? HMM? HMM? [ALL GASP] LOOK AT THESE. THEY'RE POKMON. ARE THEY REAL? HMM. [SIGHS] I WAS HOPING THERE'D BE A PARTY. HMPH. HUH? [ALL GASP] Computer: THIS IS THE POKMON REPLICATION SYSTEM. SYSTEM ACTIVATED. POKMON BASED ON GENETIC ANALYSIS. POKMON DNA SAMPLING SEQUENCE NOW IN PROGRESS. HUHH! HEY, PUT ME DOWN! WHAT ARE YA--LET GO! UHH! HELP! GRAB HIM! HELP ME! [ALL GRUNTING] YEE-YEOW! AAH! I MADE IT, BUT JUST BY A HAIR. Jessie: LOOK, THERE'S YOUR HAIR. Computer: ANALYZING POKMON BIOMATERIAL SAMPLE.

Male scientist: I HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME. [SCIENTISTS SCREAMING] I PRAY THIS RECORD OF OUR EXPERIMENT SURVIVES. A YEAR AGO, WE DISCOVERED A FOSSIL THAT PROVED TO BE THE REMAINS OF THE ANCIENT POKMON, MEW. HUH? HUH? HUH? THERE WAS SUFFICIENT GENETIC MATERIAL TO REPLICATE MEW, BUT GIOVANNI, WHO FUNDED OUR PROJECT, INSISTED WE TRY TO DESIGN SUPERCLONES MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY LIVING POKMON. MANY ATTEMPTS FAILED, BUT FINALLY OUR EXPERIMENTS PROVED SUCCESSFUL. WE PRODUCED A LIVING POKMON. WE CALLED IT MEWTWO. BUT FOR SOME REASON, THE CREATURE'S ANGER IS OUT OF CONTROL. WITH ITS PSYCHIC POWERS, IT IS DESTROYING OUR LABORATORY. WE DREAMED OF CREATING THE WORLD'S STRONGEST POKMON... AND WE SUCCEEDED. SOUNDS LIKE A REAL POKNSTEIN. SURE DOES. ONE BAD CAT. SO THIS MUST BE THE LAB. BUT IF MEWTWO DESTROYED IT... SOMEBODY REBUILT IT. YES. BUT WHO? HMM. HMM. HMM. Mewtwo: YOU HUMANS ARE A DANGEROUS SPECIES. YOU BROUGHT ME INTO YOUR WORLD WITH NO PURPOSE BUT TO BE YOUR SLAVE. BUT NOW I HAVE MY OWN PURPOSE. MY STORM WILL CREATE MY OWN WORLD... BY DESTROYING YOURS. SO YOU HATE ALL HUMANS, AND YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY US TO SAVE POKMON. NO. YOUR POKMON WILL NOT BE SPARED. THEY HAVE DISGRACED THEMSELVES BY SERVING HUMANS. THOSE POKMON ARE NOTHING BUT SLAVES. PIKA. PIKA PIKA. SO... YOU SAY I AM WRONG? THAT YOU ARE NO THIS HUMAN'S SERVANT, YOU ARE HIS FRIEND? PIKA. YOU ARE AS PATHETIC AS THE REST. PIKA. Ash: HUH? PIKA! UHH! AAH! PIKA-PI. PIKACHU. HUMANS AND POKMON CAN NEVER BE FRIENDS. ASH... ARE YOU OK? DON'T PICK ON PIKACHU. IF YOU ARE POKMON, THERE'S NO REASON I CAN'T CAPTURE YOU. GO, RHYHORN. [ROARS] OHH! NO! RHYHORN! Mewtwo: FOOLS. YOUR POKMON ATTACKS CANNOT WEAKEN ME. MY POWERS ARE TOO GREAT. NO TRAINER CAN CONQUER ME. THEN YOU WON'T MIND PROVING I IN A REAL MATCH. IS THAT A CHALLENGE? YOU BET IT IS. HMM? HUH? HUH? [ALL GASP] THEY'RE AWAKE. BLAAAST! [ROARS] SAUR. SAUR. [SHUDDERING] HMM? HMM? James: I'M SCARED. Jessie: ME, TOO. MEOWTH. Mewtwo: LIKE MOS POKMON TRAINERS, I, TOO, BEGAN WITH CHARMANDER, SQUIRTLE, AND BULBASAUR. BUT FOR THEIR EVOLVED FORMS, I USED THEIR GENETIC MATERIAL TO CLONE EVEN MORE POWERFUL COPIES. COPIES. THEY'RE CLONES. [ALL GASP] [RUMBLING] [ROARS] BLAAAST! A STADIUM. MEWTWO PLANNED THIS ALL ALONG. YOUR FAKE VENUSAUR CAN'T BEAT MY REAL ONE! RIGHT, BRUTEROOT? SAUR. WE'LL BLOW AWAY THAT BLASTOISE, WON'T WE, SHELLSHOCKER? BLAAST! IT MAY NOT HAVE A NICKNAME, BUT I DO HAVE... CHARIZARD. I CHOOSE YOU! CHARIZARD, I DIDN'T SAY START. PIK. YOUR CHARIZARD IS POORLY TRAINED. [GROWLS] HMM. Mewtwo: WHICH OF YOU WILL OPPOSE ME FIRST? SAUR. I UNDERESTIMATED YOU LAST TIME, BUT THAT WON' HAPPEN AGAIN. GO, BRUTEROOT! RAZOR LEAF! SAUR. VINE WHIP. SAUR! [GROANS] SAUR! BRUTEROOT! IT LOOKS LIKE I'M UP. GO, SHELLSHOCKER. BLASTOISE. BLAAST! SHELLSHOCKER, HYDROPUMP! BLAST! OY! SHELLSHOCKER! YOU BETTER FORFEIT, ASH. THOSE CLONES ARE TOO POWERFUL. I'M NOT GIVING UP. [ROARS] CHARIZARD, USE YOUR SPEED, NOT POWER, AND YOU'LL WIN. [GROWLS] ALL RIGHT, GO! [BOTH GROWLING] CAN'T CHARIZARD MOVE ANY QUICKER? THE CLONE IS TOO FAST. PIKA. CHARIZARD'S IN TROUBLE! FINISH IT. [ROARS] NO, CHARIZARD, NO! ARE YOU OK? Mewtwo: AS THE VICTOR, I NOW CLAIM MY PRIZE-- YOUR POKMON. NO. NO. HEY, WAIT! [GASPS] OHH! HUH? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THOSE POKMON? I WILL EXTRACT THEIR DNA TO MAKE CLONES FOR MYSELF. THEY WILL REMAIN SAFE ON THIS ISLAND WITH ME WHILE MY STORM DESTROYS THE PLANET. YOU CAN'T DO THIS! YEAH, MEWTWO, WE WON'T LET YOU! DO NOT ATTEMP TO DEFY ME. AAH! AAH! UHH! AAH! AAH! THIS IS MY WORLD NOW. OHH! UH-OH. LET'S GO! WHOA! [ROARS] GYARADOS! [BOTH GRUNTING] GET AWAY! GONG! HUH? PIKA. PIK. [MOANS] PIDGEOT! [CAWS] AW... HEY, I KNOW. MEWTWO CAN'T CAPTURE THEM IF THEY'RE ALREADY INSIDE THEIR POKBALLS. BULBASAUR, SQUIRTLE, RETURN! IT IS NO USE. HA HA HA! HUH?

I AM SPARING YOUR LIVES, FOR THE MOMENT. [DOORS CREAK OPEN] BUT YOU CANNOT ESCAPE YOUR FATE. THE HOUR OF MY VENGEANCE DRAWS NEAR. BEHOLD. AH. OHH. Mewtwo: WITH POKMON AND HUMANS ELIMINATED, THE CLONES SHALL INHERIT THE WORLD. Ash: YOU CAN'T DO THIS. I WON'T LET YOU. IT'S ASH. ALL RIGHT. PSY-YI-YI. DUCK. PSYDUCK! VULPIX!

WE WERE CREATED WITH POWERS FAR STRONGER THAN THE ORIGINALS. [MEOWING] HUH? HMM. MEW'S GOT A GOOD POINT. WHAT'S IT SAYING? MEW SAYS YOU DON' PROVE ANYTHING BY SHOWING OFF A LO OF SPECIAL POWERS, AND THAT A POKMON'S REAL STRENGTH COMES FROM THE HEART. MY CLONES DON'T NEED THEIR POWERS TO PROVE THEIR WORTH. MEW! AAH! AAH!
