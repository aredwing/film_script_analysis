I told him you weren't here. I said, "Who's this?" He said, "It's TJ. "Tell her I'm coming up". And did he say where or when? Nuh. He just said he was coming. Fuck.

And that other boy there with the black shirt with that... - Yeah, yeah. - My little granny, that one. I don't want you and Harry to pull up on him. Be a little bit fuckin' hard on him, you know? - Oh, yeah. - Don't ease up on him. Look at this shit! I don't even want to go outside anymore. Bullet's gone to the fuckin' camp 'cause he's a run-amok kid and everything's just falling apart. Why do you think that is? Why do you think your son is running around at night like a madman? 'Cause he's a little shit! I feel like slapping you, girl. You want to wise up. And you want to wise up real quick. OK. No, don't be rough with the swag. You're gonna sleep on that. OK, take your stump and sit down. OK? Hey, you know... you know why you're here? 'Cause you've been mucking around. That's why you're here. You know? What about you? What are you in trouble for? You been chasin' girls? Huh? Stealing in a shop. Robbing a shop? I don't know what we're gonna do with you. What about you, Bullet? What have you done wrong? - Lighting fire. - Lighting fire! You know, that's a serious thing too. Well, we're gonna be walking through countries. Over these creeks, over them hills. There mightn't be any water, but... we'll survive. You see lovely country, you know, when you get up on top of the hill, looking down. Sleeping in the bush, you can hear the dingoes howling at night. And get up in the morning and you hear the birds calling out. People call it desert, but to us, it's lovely to see the place our grandfathers and grandmothers come from. We're trying to save you blokes from going to jail, you know? That's why you're here. You alright, my boy? Hello, young fella. You look worried. What's the matter, my boy? You got trouble anywhere? Young fella, you must be got family trouble, look like. I wouldn't know where to start. Wouldn't know where to start to tell you. I got a little man inside of me with an axe. And that little man, I like to keep him quiet... but sometimes I've got no control over it. I fuckin' just wish there was... I got this fuckin' little man inside of me... with this fuckin' axe. This is very, very hard country. As we move along, we've got to find something to eat. And that's the only way we're gonna survive here, you know? Don't think there's no tucker. We've got to find it. You can get a goanna. You can get a snake. You boys know that we've got nothing on us, so, um... we've got a long way to go. Oh! Shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get him. I remember very, very clear... this old grandfather of mine, a bloke called Nebatabiji. I remember this day, he's carrying me. I must have been about five, six. And he was a big man. He had dogs running out, chasing kangaroos. And this one kangaroo come straight for him. And the kangaroo must have been coming about 100 miles an hour. He got the spear hooked up on a woomera. Threw it from the hip shooter. He got that kangaroo right through the chest. And I said to myself, "Jingo! "One day, I'm gonna be like this man". So I grew up trying to be somebody like him. Hey, look at them mad bastards! Hey! That my gully car. My nephew car. Pull up! Pull up! - Hey, what happening, gully? - Hello, gully. Oh, we just here making a bit of dust. - How you like that? - We can come with you? - No worries. Yeah. - Jump on! Oh! Shit. Bloody good, yeah! Whoo! Fuckin' oath. Fuckin' oath! We go dancing tonight or what, Unc? Mama says she want to dry her eyes She don't like crying Trying hard to forget her younger days Kids are wonderin' why she doesn't sing along Maybe she's dying...  Come on, Wazza! Let's have a party here! Come on, Wazza. Let's run amok, brother! Fuckin' car! Oh! - What was that? - Whoa, pull up! Pull up, pull up, pull up! Oh, shit. He might fuckin' blow up, the bastard! Come on! Come on, get out! Get out of there, Wazza! - It's ruined now! - Fuck! Get out of there! Get out of there! Oh, fuck! There goes the ride, boys. We'll be fuckin' walking from here. You can have a little bit of rest here today. Another walk tomorrow morning. And tomorrow morning, a long walk. Must be something... something in you, eh? Something bothering you? I don't know. Why are you so angry? I guess it's my mum. She not really round much. She always out drinking. Alright. But, um... you gonna straighten up? If you keep on doing this, you're not going to be with your family. You're gonna be locked up all the time. Hello, hello, my brother. Hey, bro. What happened here? Those young fellas give us lift, me and this young fella here. And then it blow up on us. Is that Wazza's car? Yeah. Where's all the piss? All got burnt up in his motor car. We can get a lift? Yeah. Alright. Jimmy! How are you, fella? What are you doing up here, mate? Just cruising. Passing through. You don't look like you're from up these parts. You look like a bit of a sheep-eater to me. What the fuck's that supposed to mean? What I mean by that... is, what the fuck are you doing up here? I might be looking for work. Might go work out in the mines. Might be up here on a holiday. Working on my tan. Scratching my balls in the sun. When I see fuckin' shit, I know shit. And you look like fuckin' shit to me, pal. I'm not gonna go there. You're just trying to get a rise out of me so you've got a reason to lock me up. I know coppers like you. Yeah? I've been in the city with coppers. You know? Yeah, well, you're up here now. Five Rivers is my fuckin' turf. And I don't like when fuckin' cunts come up here and think they can hide away up this end of the world. You fuck up up here, pal... and you'll fuckin' deal with me. Look, I've got a young fella up here I'm visiting. Yeah? My son, actually. I mean, if you're running from something... I'll find out, pal. Jesus! Fuck! What's wrong with this fella here? What's he doing? I don't know, my boy. Are you here to see Nella? Yeah. Well, I know who your fuckin' boy is, then, boy. I really know who your son is. Put your head under the water. - Yep. Alright. - Ready... go! Get him! Grab him by the tail! Run! Whoo! Last day today, boys. We'd better hurry up. You want to see your girlfriend? Come on, get in front. Don't let the old fella lead you. I'm glad I'm going home. I'm gonna have a shower. Hello, hello, my countrymen! Look who's back. Hello again! What, you been swimming, eh? Thomas. You need to sort out what you come here for. So don't go wandering, eh? Hey, Black. See you, brother. - See you, mob. - See you, brother. - How are you going? - Hello. Got to find a place to hide my head A shady billabong Crash out on a cyclone bed Maybe time will right the wrongs But nothing really matters In the season of the lullin' Yeah, nothing really matters When you're rolling on the run Drifting off in dreamland Cops and journos on my trail Trying to pin me down with slander Trying to haul me off to jail But nothing really matters In the season of the lullin' No, nothing really matters When you're rolling on the run.  Hey. So, what, did you expect some big welcoming party, did you? I just want to see him, Nella. Reckon we should be counting our fuckin' blessings? The great man has arrived? I've come a long fuckin' way. So you should! And you're 13 years late! He's not here. He's not sitting around waiting for you just 'cause you phoned and said you were coming. - Yeah, well, good... - I only made that mistake once. Yeah, well, good to see you all fuckin' glamorous and perfect with your fucked-up lives here. This place is a shithole. Well, no-one asked you to come! You know, me and you had that great time all those years ago, but all you've fuckin' done since then is lie to me and fuck up that boy. He don't give one shit about you. Have you got any idea the fuckin' shit I've been through the last couple of fuckin' years? I don't care! I don't give a shit, Thomas! Just go. You're not here to be real and you're not here to be no father, so fuck off! Yeah, well, I'm not gonna listen to this fuckin' shit anyway! Yeah, good. There you go, TJ. Cheers. - Cup of tea? - Ah. Thank you, sis. How are you, my boy? He don't need me. He better off without me anyway. You right, Grandpa? Yep. This is mammoditch place here, Uncle, this country. That's a Noongar word. It means 'the best'. Bet you fellas have got a big mob of sacred places round here. Oh, big mob round here, my boy. On our river down in Perth... our sacred site, where the Wakkal, he had his final resting place there... they built a road... there, and a bridge. The whitefellas even built a brewery on it. Right on the freshwater spring. I used to go there when I was a little fella. Throw rocks at that poxy place. But this country here, it's like medicine. This is my son's country. He's here now? Yep. So he's... really here? Yes, bub. Mmm. But, Mum, you said that he not... I knowwhat I said, bub. And you don't have to see him if you don't want to. But he is here. Do you reckon he'll like us? Course he will, baby. But why'd he come now? Nella! I want to see him! Nella, you can hate me, but I want to see my son. You fellas can talk to each other, you know. You want to go for a walk, mate? That's alright with you? Hmm? All I'm saying is just have a little bit of patience. He come long way, you know? At least he's here. Yeah, it's just... it's hard. 'Cause he's been running around for 13 years, acting like he doesn't care, and now I don't know what to expect from him. And, what, you're perfect? Well, at least I've stopped drinking. Good. Anyone? Fair enough. Maybe a bit too soon, eh? Maybe as we go along, people can start feeling comfortable in saying something. We'll try again next week, eh? It's good. So, where's TJ and Bullet today? Watching the footy. That's what my husband used to do with his sons. Watch the footy! - That's true, Aunty. - That's right. They might have even said a few words to each other by now. Catfish swimming In the brown water mud Salt water running Through the fresh river flood...  You know what? I heard you've got to watch out for the crocs, eh? You get pretty big crocs up here? - Mmm. - I've never seen a crocodile. You've got a deadly haircut there. Who does your hair? Me and my mates cut it. Solid. Rivers and lakes Where the rain comes down We're gonna wash them blues away When the rain comes down On a hot summer's day...  Hey. TJ. How are you going? Yeah, Elvis. And a-one, two, one, two, three, four... Dust flies up and it's dry as hell Fire breaks out like a magic spell Twisting and a-turning like some big old snakes Veins through the land, rivers and lakes When the rain comes down Gonna wash them blues away, yeah Oh, when the rain comes down On a hot summer's day, yeah.  I'll see you during the week. I'm sure you'll be here. Got to go. Goodnight. Somebody's gotta work. See you mob tomorrow. - See you, girls. - Goodnight, Uncle. Thank you. - Friday night, eh? - Friday night in Five Rivers. Fuckin' alright. Last sip of wine Last cigarette I've lived a full life I have no regrets Oh, man, my patience is tired My brain's always wired Oh, the pain in our hearts Tore us apart How we gonna find a fantasy? Something special just for you and me? Kinda happy but it still feels sad...  I see you've still got the tatt. Been trying to scrub it off for years. Want some of this? I don't drink. You're joking. I'm not gonna bite you. I'm the father of your son. Oh, come on. This is a bad idea. No, it's not. It's just two people dancing. For the want and more A strain on the core Oh, now, the hold and the truth Is something aloof How we gonna find a fantasy? Something special just for you and me Kinda happy but it stills feels sad Kinda sane but a little mad...  Mmm... I can't do this, eh? What do you mean, you can't do this? I mean I fucking can't do this, TJ! I can't be with you. Fuck. So, that's what it is, eh? I'm not fuckin' good enough for you? What are you fucking...?! Fuck off! Oh, typical fuckin' TJ. Got to start smashing shit up. - Get! - Hey, mate. Get out! Baby, put it down. It's alright. He's gone. Bullet? Will you rise or will you fall? Will you walk or will you crawl? Will you dream in black and white When you're sleeping cold tonight? Will you bend or will you break? Will you give or will you take? Will no angel shine no light?  I need to get out of here, Aunty. I need to come back home. I'm sorry, my boy, but I can't do it anymore. I'm tired. I'm sick of worrying about you. Just book my bus fare. I gotta get out of this shithole! You're a grown man now. You've got to stand on your own two feet. Fuck ya! I know there's a bag of shit in your pocket. Hand it over! Or this fella's gonna cop it. And this fella, that fella, and you! Hand it over now! Would you fail or would you leave? Would you stand your ground and fight When I'm sleeping cold tonight? Way, oh, way Way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, I.  You little cunt! What did I tell you?! I warned you, gave you all the possible chances, and you fucked it up. Who the fuck do you think you are? Just one of those fuckin' coppers who thinks his fuckin' shit doesn't stink. Is that right? - Hey? You don't know me, pal. - Fuck! Fuck you. I always wanted to flog a copper. Well, come on, then! Get up! That's what you want? That's how you want it? I was gonna cap that, you little prick! We've all been through the shit up here, bro. And I don't want my family putting up with no more. That's your ticket out of here. The bus comes in half an hour. I know I might come across as a bit of a hard bastard, but, you know... amongst all the chaos and bullshit... somebody's got to be strong for everyone, you know? But you're my grandson's father. And you belong to us now. If that's what you want. Bullet, open the door! Go away! Leave me alone! Come on, baby. I don't want to see you. I don't want to see anybody! Bullet! That's enough, baby. Come on. Come out. Baby, come on. Nella. This is your damage. You fuckin' fix it. Just leave me alone! Hey, mate. Go away. Leave me alone. Bullet, it's me, mate. Your dad. I hate you, you dog. I hate you. Come on, mate. Let me in. I said go away. Are you deaf or what? Go on, get! Hello? Deadly, unna, them birds? What did you come here for? I come here to see you. You seen me. Now you can go. No, mate. I don't believe you. I know. But you will. I, uh... just want to share that... I've had a pretty... pretty hard week. A few things with my family. Had to sort a few things out. Little... few things with my grandson and... My... my boy's been like a son to me. I've... You guys know... I've grown my grandson up from a... from a baby, and... we all need a man in our life. A father... father figure. Um... I've never had that opportunity, but... I'm glad that my grandson's father's here to be with him. Mmm. But it's good to see his father turn up here, and... I'm sort of... proud that he's here to see his son. Yeah. Got to find a place to hide my head A shady billabong And crash out on the cyclone bed...  I grew up basically going to... well, getting locked up. I basically got locked up before I was 10 years old. Getting locked up. I was in that process before I was 10 years old. I grew up, um, witnessing domestic violence. I've consequently been through some relationships with domestic violence. And it's hard when you're there. Um, and if you're... you know... if you end up being one of those women... that can step outside and look at what's actually going on and realise that you don't want that for your life... And even if you've only been locked up for one night... and you wake up in a prison cell... and you're coming down off the drink and the drugs and... You know, and then they read in your sheet, they... When they release you, they're saying to you... You know, you're obviously signing your release papers, and it's like, "Oh, assault," you know? And then you're like, "Fuck," and start thinking about that poor bastard lying in hospital that you beat the crap out of, you know? And he's just gonna be going around, "Well, I just got beaten up by a drunken blackfella". You know? And then there's a... You know, I'd have... You know, I'd start crying. Then it went to drinking really bad. And it was a choice. I think the biggest thing for me was my kids. I got to a point where... I thought, "Well, if I really love my kids, I should give it another go," you know? And maybe change my ways, get a job. Here I am in denial about so many things, and I'm a man. Fuckin' bullshit, you know. I wasn't... You know, I haven't... I've only just started to become a man... in the last fuckin' three years, you know? Because I was blaming other... blaming, you know? And a bit of that poor fella me would come out in my drinking... and then I'd, like, turn that into rage, you know? That's why a lot of those kids go the wrong way, walking the street and doing what they want to do, trying to find something, and something they find, maybe the wrong people, they mix up with, and that is the people that get into trouble. It is different when they get out there in a different environment, you know? You know, once you get 'em away from town, they're different kids. They love it. And that's why I like taking them out. The first sergeant I worked with, he said to me one day, he said, "The best copper is an ex-crim". 'Cause you think like them, you know? You know what they're thinking and you can... Body language, you know all that shit, because you've done all that crap. And you can only do that sober or clean, you know? You can't... No use getting drunk and then getting emotional, you know? You've got to get emotional and cry when you're sober, and go through that over a long period of time. I'm the kind of woman that clashes with a mad bastard, because I can be pretty mad myself, so... yeah. Yeah, the biggest fight I've ever had in my life... is within myself. And the hardest fight is with me. And, yeah, I'm still fighting. I'm still having that fight. A mad bastard, he's not really, really mad. He's in between. He can be a good man when he's sober.. and he can be a mad bastard when he's drunk. There's nothing wrong with that. But it might seem to be mad, but... it's not. But it's just a good... good name for that movie.
