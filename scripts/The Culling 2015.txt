Hey, take it easy, okay'? We found your daughter... You're at my house with my daughter, and I don't know who the hell you are. All right, whoa, chill. Who are you'? Hey, pal, try to see it from my wife's perspective, all right'? Our daughter disappears, and then she shows up with a bunch of strangers. Fine, whatever. (Emily) Look, we stopped at Chapman's Cafe and, I mean, we found her in the parking lot. The parking... Actually, she kind of found us. (Wayne) What are you guys doing nut here? We're on our way to South by Southwest. And we should go. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Um, wait, wait. Um... Look, I'm sorry I... It's just, it's our daughter. She means the world to us. We understand. (Wayne) She's not going to be staying with her grandfather anymore. Thank you for bringing her back. Of course. We're just happy she's okay. (Val) I'm Val. By the way, this is, um, this is my husband, Wayne. Hey. Sean. (Val) So, sweet pea, what do you say we go in the house and get ready for bed, okay'? Okay. Bye, Lucy. BYE-bye. Bye. So, how was the food at Chapman's? It was closed. Oh, yeah'? You guys hungry? I'm about to get my steak on. Mm, I love steak. Inch thick, grass-fed porterhouse. Uh, yeah, I mean, I think we really should be hitting the road. Don't listen to him. He only thinks about himself. South by Southwest. Me and Val's been there three times. It's great music. You ever been there before? Uh, yeah, I've been once. Are you 420 friendly? Psst, you kidding? That's like his area code. [laughing] Look, I apologize for my wife, but, you know, we all have moms, right'? (All) Yeah. (Wayne) Anyone want a beer? Yes. (Emily) A beer sounds great. Besides, a little bit of buddyness never hurt anyone either. All right. So, you've really been three times'? (Emily) So, how did you guys end up out here? (Wayne) Well, we, uh, we owned a day-care center in the city. We were doing pretty good, we were making some good money, and providing a great service for the community. And... One night, someone decided to set the whole place up on fire. Yeah, our whole life burned to the ground, just like that. The world's a crazy place. It sure is. We wanted to start over, and her father lives out here. Yeah. You know, and we didn't want Lucy exposed to all the funky stuff going down in the city. That's a song. What'? That last part you just said about the funky stuff in the city, that's a song. [laughs] It must have been in my subconscious. Anyway, that's how we wound up here. Well, I like it. I like you two. You know? I like how you're out here, living off the land. Hey, I think he's kind of cute for an older guy. (Sean) I mean, you get it. You don't have to deal with any of those, uh, dickheads in the city. Some different idiot around every comer, right? Yeah. [growling] Stop. Emily, I love your bag. Oh, gosh, thank you. Where did you get it'? Um, it was a gift. Well, it's very stylish. (Emily) Thank you. [growling] So, I saw all the toys out in the front. Are guys still running a day care'? Yeah, sometimes. I mean, you know, Wayne takes the odd job here and there, and we just do whatever we need to to get by, you know. [eerie growling] ( Tyler) Man, these bugs are crazy, man. How can you get used to this? [Lucy's voice] Don't be mad at me. You can? Run away without legs. Besides, I would find you. [laughs] Ah, well. I guess she's awake. [chuckling] I'll be right back. Can I get anyone anything while I'm up'? How about another six pack'? Can't get it yourself? Didn't you just ask if you could get anything for us'? Yes, no, of course. Of course, babe. Can I get anyone else anything while I'm up'? Actually, I could use another Bud. Do you need any help in the kitchen? No, I got it. Please. You're our guests. I'll be right back. (Tyler) Come on, dude, sit. Careful, brother. Wasted much'? Whoa. [chuckling] Here, you obviously need more of this. Now what are you still doing awake, huh'? My dolls were fighting. Oh. Well, Mommy is here now, so everything's going to be just fine. [Lucy's voice] ls the nice girl going to stay with us? (Val) Maybe. [Lucy's voice] I wish she would. She's so nice. And pretty. Well, it is way past your bedtime, and it is time for you to go to sleep, little one. I'll tuck you in. I think she likes you. I love you. Hove you, too. (Tyler) But no, listen, okay? Back to what I was saying, there's this show. Ugh. No, it's a TV show, okay'? These people, they're like... [eerie growling] What was that'? Speaking of which, no, they do these crazy things where on this TV show they go to these haunted places and they prove that spirits exist. That haunted show is a joke. You're such a turd. Not that show again. (Ty/er) The TV show. You watch that, do you'? (Emily) Yeah, he does. You do. He does. I've... No I've only seen it a few times, so. That's a lie. He watches it all the time. ( Tyler) Nu, you watch it all the time. (Emily) I mean, there's just no limit to what these reality shows are going to exploit. I mean, people shouldn't mess with the occult. No, no. She's right. 'Cause it's real. I've seen it. The whole dark spirit world is no joke. Oooh! It shouldn't be messed with. (Tyler) This is exactly what I've been saying. Is that how you wound up in the loony bin'? Hey. She was in rehab, ass-wipe. You know? You know that. Hank. I'm sorry. There's a big difference, babe. Don't listen to them. Okay. And that's why people shouldn't do drugs. It weakens their defenses. It's true. That's why I stopped doing the hard stuff. (Sean) Yeah, and hey, besides, everybody knows that all of that stuff from those shows is like totally made up anyway. Which is why they're stupid, kinda like Tyler. [laughing] You're... You're a dumb-ass, Sean. Okay, I've only... I haven't seen the show every week, all right'? I've only seen it maybe three times. The world is going to hell in a hand basket, and my man sees it that way. What is wrong with that'? There you go. At least someone's got my back. Thanks, bro. [chuckles] I stand corrected. (Val) More beer. Oh, how is she'? Is she okay'? (Val) Oh, she's fine. She's just playing with her dailies. (Hank) Thank you so much. Yeah, I don't think we should leave her with her grandfather anymore. I think he's too old. Let's not talk about that now, okay'? Why not'? 'Cause it's not appropriate. Well, it's not like it's a secret. Drop it. Let's not do this now, yeah'? Okay. Dropped. [strange growling] What was that'? Came from the barn. Do you guys have animals? Probably just some critter. Are you sure that there's no one in there'? Oh, no, no. It's nothing. Look, I'm going to go put another log on the fire. (Sean) Need any help? No, I'm fine, thank you. Need any help getting any wood? I'm good. (Hank) Shut up, Sean. (Wayne) She's really good with the ax. You going to spark that thing or what'? What'? You going to spark that? I don't know what you're talking about. You know, we have an extra room, inflatable mattress. You guys are more than welcome to stay. No. [howling] What the hell happened? [screams] Oh, oh, God. What the hell did you do? Oh, my God, the ax slipped. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God, slipped. Well, why don't you watch what the hell you're doing? I think she out herself. Take it easy on her, okay'? She out her leg pretty bad. Pal, don't tell me how to act with my wife. Sorry, she out her leg pretty bad. I'm such an idiot. Okay, there's blood everywhere. Um... Okay, I think you've got to go to the hospital. Do you have a first aid kit'? I can prep this wound. How do you know how to do that'? I'm in school to be a physician's assistant. [cries out] Sorry, sorry. There's a first aid kit above the refrigerator. Baby, I'm sorry, I have no idea it was... Come here. Let's get you inside, okay'? I-I-I-I got her, I got her, I got her, I got her. Get out of here. I gather. Okay, sorry. Yup. [laughter] Is Mommy okay? She just has a little booboo and we have to get her to the doctor's. Okay? Okay. All right'? Let's go. [groaning] Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. Easy. Okay. [groans] Sorry. How far to the hospital are we'? Ugh, about an hour and a half. (Lucy) I don't want to go. Get in the truck with your mother. I don't like the hospital. Can I stay home with Emily'? I don't mind if, you know, if it helps. You sure'? Yeah. All right. [Val groans] Hi, Mummy. Hi, sweet pea. Are you okay'? Yeah, I think so. Hey, look, I'm really sorry about this. I know this is probably ruining your trip. Don't apologize. I mean, it was an accident. Yeah. Mommy's fine. Daddy, I have to tell you something. What is it, munchkin'? It's a secret. [cries out] [Whispers] Okay, okay. All right. Take care of her. Come on, Luce. You'll be all right. "(Emily) " After several days, King Duck came over to play with them. "Everyone cheered and Joey and his new pup Fin "made friends with all the ducks. "And the ducks invited them to their secret hideout. And they were all friends forever." Will you read it to me once more'? All right, but then you got to go to bed. Okay. From the top.

You're such a jackass. What, me'? Why'? That's not how it works. Come on. It worked with you, didn't it'? No. (Hank) Isn't there anyone who has a phone out here though? I looked around, there's no phone in the whole house. "When the rain stopped, he found himself outside a storefront. "A happy puppy was there to greet him. 'What's you name? He asked." Sean. Yeah? Do you have any more weed? Yeah. Let's go outside. [inhaling] [coughing] Are you coughing? It doesn't happen that often. Oh. [Announcer 1] Jackie hands it off to Jackson. Oh, what a block. With the block he's at the 25, the 35. Thirty-five. I'm really glad that you could make it tonight, baby. Mm-hm. When she out herself, I saw like a spirit or something. The woman's got bad energy. Could we just not talk about that right now, please? It's real. Yeah. How are your parents'? Losers. Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. Why didn't you come visit me in rehab? Come on, baby, we've talked about this, you know? I was just really busy with school, you know, and work. It's like having two jobs. Whatever. Could make it up to you. No, I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this again. Stop. (Emily) "And they were looking for a home. " Come on, get in there. Lie down. I'm not tired. I want to go outside and play with my friends. What friends?

Yeah, okay. Ready? No, no, no, no. I don't think I can. ( Tyler) Try not to move. You're going to be all right. [screaming] [screaming] I'm going to get you some help. Dude, I got you, bro. What'? Wait, no. What are you doing? I'm going to get Hank some help. No you're not. You're not going outside. Do you even know what's out there'? I don't care what's out there. I do. You're not going out there. Tyler, let go of me. No, I'm not. Let me go. No, you're staying right... No, you're not going... I'm going to do whatever I want. Fine, all right'? But look at me.

Um, I'll be back. [voices whispering] [children laughing] Lucy? Lucy, what are you doing? Is that you'? [growling] Who's there'? Huh? I got a gun. [growling] You're so stupid. [echoing] You're so stupid. [gunshot] Hank, wake up. Stay with me. Hank, you got to stay awake, okay'? You're going to be okay. Look at me, look at me. Hank, you're going to be okay. Try and keep awake. Come on, you're going to be fine. I'm going to look for some medical supplies. Amanda. [screaming] Amanda? (Amanda) Oh, my God. Amanda. Oh, my God. [sobbing] Oh, my God.

I don't know what happened to Tyler, but I think our best bet is for me to go and try and find some help, okay'? Yes. Are you sure'? Because I'll stay with you. No, yeah. Yeah, just do it. Okay. I'm good. Most people never figure out what's going on. Can I have my knife, baby cakes? Here you go, bun-bun. [groans] [moans] Good job, baby. Thanks. Stop, stop. (Wayne) What's going on? We need help. Sean's dead. We have to go to the police. That's exactly what we're going to do. (Emily) I'm so glad you guys found me. Oh, me, too. [whimpering] Lucy? Lucy? Luce? (Val) LUCY, honey?

Oh, sweetie. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. It's all going to be fine. My flesh, they shall not perish. You'll seek vengeance. I don't know what's happening to us. Sean's dead, Hank's dead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [growling] [shrieking] This was kind of my idea, this trip. We got to get out of here. Yeah. God, I just feel like... like this is just a bad dream. But it's real. Oh, no, it's fine. Come here. Lucy was right. You have the most beautiful eyes. What are you doing? Let's go. No. No, you listen to me. My daughter is missing. Someone's been killed in my house. My house. I think we have a lot to figure out, all right'? Yeah, I'm just... I'm just a little scared. I'm freaked out. It's all right to be freaked out. You just got to try and remain calm. Everything's going to work out. It's going to be fine. Get off of me. No, no, no. Stop. Good job, baby. It's all right. Oh, God, I love this purse. It's one of my favorites. You think she's out? I don? Know. Little bitch might be faking it. [screaming] Get off me. Let me go. No. Get a rope. Yeah. Help me. No! Calm down. Somebody help me. Calm down. Calm down. [growling] I'm going to get you out of here. [growling] [gasps] (Wayne) Always masterful. He does it different every time. Has he shown himself to you'? Sometimes he does, and sometimes he doesn't. He first appeared to me the night of the fire. My business burned. Lucy was dropped in the flames. He gave me the option to save her, but then I would have to build an army of children. He chose me, just like he's chosen you. All those children are his. I've created them with different women. In different shapes, in different sizes. And he has told me that you are special. [murmuring] The sun will darken. The moon will not give light. The stars, they'll fall from the sky. And the third part of man will be slain. They shall set the fire upon Magog, but he will not perish. And the fire shall be set upon Magog but he shall not perish. He shall seek vengeance. There will be a great culling. A culling of mankind, and he shall reign for a thousand years. And we shall be with him.
