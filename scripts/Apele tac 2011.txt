What do you mean yes? Yes means no. Just the two of us or I'm not interested anymore. Since you are the boss, why do you need me? Why don't you go alone? Just try and pass alone. You don't know anything. If I were you I would calm down for your own sake. Oh, yea? Yes! Aren't my people on the other side? Aren't my people risking to carry you to the Germans? Instead of me who would carry you over the border? Tell me! 3 means 1 extra. You help me and I help you, afterwards everyone is on it's own. The discussion is over. You have the connection, please. Thank you! Hey you there! What are you doing here? I've just worked here, but now mother nature calls. You can't be here! Border area! I know, I know... The ID! Sure, there you go! You're from Caransebes? Yes! Do you have an authorisation? Yes I do! Let me see it. The attempt to cross over the state border it's punished with up to 3 years in jail. Yes but... Listen here, if we catch you on the Danube you are convicted with 10 years in jail. Yes, but I wasn't on the Danube... Open the trunk! Yes...
