I got it. - We need the general by all means, no matter how. Are you sure your plan will work? Master, will we get through the roof ok? And this you should distribute between the groups. How much for each group is your decision. This is for Damaskus. For the weapons. Here is the account-number. And here is half a million for the completed operations in Semyonovsk. You were to prepare an operation in Russia, weren't you? My people in the south are ready, we are waiting for your command and the money. Ok, and remember - I am expected to act - the louder, the better. This will be heard in all of Russia - they'll get deaf! Salman, sonny, show us the tape with the priests. I want to see it with my own eyes before paying. All's clear, let's start Operation Hen House. Enough. I said, turn it off! Those butchers... It's their fault that we are called beasts. I ordered to terminate them - that's all. And they made a slaughter out of it. Let's do it like this. Destroy the tape and never work with them again. Take him. Shit! Fox, are you alive? Damn, brother, come to yourself! - Where is the father? I will find you...Pigs. Faster, you turtles! We did it. My congratulations. Thank you. Oh, you Badger! - Ok, fine. Here... i have a watch for you... ...a real commander watch. Who has a watch like this will always be ... the commander of the family. Here, take it. - Thank you. By the way, how are things in Zelenogorsk? Fine as always. There was a truck with drugs - had to shoot around a bit. Really? Is everybody ok? Whoever is late... - Come on, drink it up! Well? Bottoms up! - bitter! Here, take it - this is for you. Cool! Can I borrow it? - This is practically impossible. This is a special weapon, it obeys only its owner. It recognizes the master by his hand. A new generation of smart weapons. - Thanks, Alexei Ivanovich. You know, the department is considering your constant complaints. What complaints? I haven't complained about anything. About your service car. So, you can give your old junk to somebody in the team. And you will be driving a new Audi. Do you know what acceleration it's got? In 7 seconds from 0 to 100 km/h! Well, thank you. We have to drink to this. - Sure. Here are the newlyweds. Patrio muerte. My congratulations. - Thank you. I have something for you -especially for you. Now I am going to type my reports on it. - You and your department are lagging behind! This is for making money. There is this web-site. Alfa Direct. I have bought for you several shares as a wedding gift. The rest is your business - I'll show you! Be careful, you'll drop it! - Don't worry, it's armoured. Banker - in one word. - Banker, ban-ker - two words! All the best and excuse us. Bye. - It's ok, thank you. Hi, congratulations! - Thank you. This is for you, a wedding gift. A very good thing, with a photocamera. I have even connected your numbers. You have 3 and you - 2. I hope it'll be useful. Wow, it's cool. Let's go drink to it. - He doesn't drink. Doesn't know how. The dress...Is it from France?- No, from here. I'll show you the place after. To the health of the newly-married! All is under control... Hey, Commander! What's wrong?- I am a bit tired. Hold on, darling. Only a little more. I love you. I'm sorry, there is somebody waiting for you in the pavilion. Are we compromising your reputation? - Yes, you are. Congratulations. Thank you. May you live happily! I've baked it myself. -No way! Is this a bribe? This is for luck. Let's go. My congrats. How are you? - The best day in my life. Want an injection? - A cup ot tea, better. So, what's in Cuba? - As usual. Sunny and hot. Shall I undress you? - Thank you. I don't want to promise you anything. A married man i doesn't differ much from a single one. Well, I congratulate you. You've become my wife. Thank you. You are very unlucky. Nobody will ever envy your position. I know. But I am happy. Me too. We will have a long happy life. Until we die on the same day. Only I one second earlier than you. I love you. I love you so much. Wife...your husband... is not very well. Give me an injection. Everyone is here. What do you want? - We're friends visiting Broom. How is it going? - So-so, always renovating. We've got to talk. That's all that is left. Three of my peple are dead. Why do you think that it was Cross? -Who else could it be? I don't have problems with other gangs.And one of my people recognized Gangrene. Who else could it be but Cross? Where can I find him? - He has a company named In Motion. Laundering money in film distribution. Has come up a lot. Good for him. Who do you need, guys? Sergey, make a good pirate copy. Quiet! Did you know that Broom is selling my goods? - And who is asking? That was my goods. And nobody should touch my stuff. Broom was selling in our territory. I counted on that money, a lot. I need it very much. Where is my money? And where is my stuff? - More likely in the john. ... I don't sell drugs. - What? I need explosives, weapons and fast cars. Because of you, I have lost a lot of money and a good fighter. Why have brought Cross here? His people are going to look for him now everywhere, and for me too! Nodoby dares to touch my stuff. That is - our stuff. You said nobody knows about this place. Sit tight, and noone will find you. Ah, what have I got myself into? - Keep yourself busy! As soon as we get the weapons, we'll get out of here. In the local prison there is this Major Glatkov, head of security. Let your men find him and bring him here. And if he won't come? He dreams about meeting me. I have seen 3 armed men enter this door. And what about the one that fell out of the window? - He got into the car and left. I think it was a gangs' showdown. - Gangrene, Cross's bodyguard. Liked baking bread. Syary - the accountant. - Ah, you know these men well. Tell me then, why have they killed them with knives? and that one, by the sofa was killed by a pen in the neck? He was one of the attackers. - Sure? Looks like he's not from here. - How can you be so sure? He's got a mark from a breech-block on his forefinger. - Caucasian... Certainly not from Tibet. Who killed him then? The one who got out through the window...Who was it? - I wonder how much money they got. It wasn't just money, it was mafia's fund. Now we have to hurry, find them until they are found by others. Lyuba, you asked me to wake you up. Do you hear me? I think not.I am going to get some cold water! Then I'll divorce you! Ok, then, sleep.- But you promised to wake me up. Lyuba, I am just an invalid. And I am confused - to wake you up or not? To wake up...But tenderly...I am not one of your soldiers...Don't scare away my dreams... My Sunlight! The love of my life! I am an old policeman and don't know words of love...But I am your husband. I have to go fight the evil. And the evil usually has ugly faces. Sunlight, show me your face! What're you doing? That photo is ugly, give it back. It's perfect. I have to go. Call me after, ok? OK. - So that I'll hear something nice. And tell Petrovich not to drive the ambulance too fast. Patients are sensitive. Hello. Why did you want to see me, boss? - I missed you. Oh, really? If you had missed me you would have come to see me long ago, for a cup of tea. You have always been smart. -If I were smart, I wouldn't cooperate with you. If you didn't cooperate, you would be now in prison, somewhere far away, say in "sunny" Magadan. Whatever, now tell me what you want. Who killed Cross and took the mafia fund? That's the mystery of the century, boss. The whole of theives' community is wondering the same. Who could benefit by it? - I think it could be Broom. He and Cross had a disagreement. Cross made him angry. Cross has destroyed all Broom's goods and money as well. Obviously, that was his answer. But to steal the mafia's fund? Jeez, I don't think it ever happened. What? - Quiet. So, what do you think? Could those be visitors? - Who knows? More likely, they were hired by Broom. Don't you think the same? And Broom is hiding somewhere - I haven't seen him in two days. And Cross disappeared too. Do you know Broom's address? - And why do you want it? His people should know it. Ask them. And where is Metis? Please, not very long. He needs rest. - Well, I see this time, it's serious. It's ok, I have had worse. In a couple of days I'll be all right. As I understand, Mr. Metis, you wouldn't tell me who visited you I won't give it up. I will start interrogating, getting on your nerves. I'll make it a big deal. I'll bring to light your past crimes. And I'll find out the truth. OK, do it. I don't care. Well, then. Who killed that guy with a pen in the neck? It was beautiful. I understand you got really offended. Will you have revenge yourself or hire somebody? Boss, why don't you stick to your own business and not meddle with mine? You mean - your business? It's my business. At least tell me, were those guys from here or not? Not from here. How many were there? - I saw 3. Did you recognize anybody? Enough, boss. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. That's true. But that's where our friendship ends. I won't tell you anything else - not now, not ever. Fine. I'm leaving. Be careful. I need grenade launchers, good communications... more explosives... we can't fight with these toys. Damn it all, what are you getting me into? Stop talking about that Broom. I have no time and no resources to deal with him now. You know what the criminality level of the city is. Take it easy, please. Have you been to the doctor today? Of course, not. The doctors are complaining about you. You still haven't completed the rehabilitation course. Alexei Ivanovich, do I look like an invalid? - No, but you are a pain in the ass. I've made lots of mistakes. - Mistakes? And this could be another one. It could be, but I hope I am right here. It's better to lose time and effort than people's lives. Cross was not killed by the mafia. - By who then? Maybe, Al-Qaida sent its fighters to kill a couple of our thieves? Is it not clear that it wasn't a quarrel between local gangs? Listen here, Korenev, as far as I know... ...you knew this Cross. He was kind of a friend of yours. Anybody can suggest that you have common financial interests...That's why you're worried so much. If you wanted to offend me, you didn't succeed. This is Glatkov, head of security, as you asked. Do you understand why I invited you here? I need certain information...immediately. And when do I get money? - Money? You haven't done anything yet, why should I pay you? And when do I get money? - Money? You haven't done anything yet, why should I pay you? I don't pay in advance. What else will I have to do? - I'll tell you. Later. And then you'll get paid. Go now. Hey you...come here. What do you want? I need the address of the SOBR Commander. Litvinov. It's done, then. Money for the information. You'll get more afterwards. But don't tell anything to my brother, ok? I can't stand it any longer. If I knew it would be so boring, I wouldn't have come foward as a witness. And what about your civic duty? This one...He looks familiar. This one, it's him. He looks just like that one. I am sending you a photofit picture. You've got a surprise coming! Are you sure? All witnesses recognized this man. I was sure he was dead. I shot him - only 2 meters far. Yes, but he shot you from the same distance, and you are alive. Quiet, quiet! Let's take turns... Fox! This one is the fighter killed in Cross's office. Umar Makaev. Wanted by Interpol. The three fighters are accused of participating in the three local conflicts. ... with our friend Uzhah. - I saw it coming... After we arrested General Oduev, Uzhah got no more money. It's only a matter of time when his team will break up. I told you to take turns! - And now they will be looking for us. It's a vendetta now. Are the SOBR members' houses being watched? - Yes, sir! This is all too meaningless for Uzhah...He is contriving something bigger, something huge. Litvinov has visitors. Yes, Beard and Hare. You've got visitors. Hoppla. The client is moving. On position. -Attention everyone. Have mercy on my flat. Going in with the explosion. Dead. Fucking shit. Who were those people? - They are not people, they're fucking mutants. General Nyrkov please. Nasim and Rustam got killed because of you! Now we have to leave the city! I didn't know there would be an ambush. I thought we'd succeed. But we got there and there was an ambush! You are here because I permitted you to come along! I've got a mission in this city. And if you don't interfere I will fulfill it! Ali, how could you have listened to him! He said that you knew. Damn you all! We are moving out. Where? Where are you going with all these weapons and your fucking ugly faces? You tell me. No, you can leave. I've done my part. - Not yet. Now all of you, and me, will be hunted by the police of the whole region! You are afraid of the wrong people. Get ready. How can I help you? - Vodka. With pepper. Two. Here you are. So, they have come to kill us. Not only that. - How do you know? The fact that they stole money of the mafia's fund means that... they need money for a big operation. We are just a sidedish. Hi. No, not long. I'll tell you when I get home. Kiss you. Now they have money. And where is Cross? Dead? Where is Broom? We have to find Broom. That way we'll find all of them. Are you sure that Broom has something to do with it? Sir, do you remember Misha Pechony? Who is it? One of Broom's dealers. We tried to arrest him several times but had to let him walk away. We had no evidence. Pechony is as slippery as they come. And this slippery character could be our last chance to find Broom. Alexei Ivanovich, we have to arrest him. Arrest him. But catch him in the act! Yes, Alexei Ivanovich. Have you got lost here? - I know here every corner. Why? You are the boss, you don't need it. - Nowadays one can't trust anybody but himself. While we are here, you should stop the production. - Sure. Better safe than sorry. Misha ? What ? - I've come for the stuff, as we agreed. And the dough? Come on, give me some to taste. You'll taste it. You fools...You were fools and you'll always be fools. Petrovich ? - Yeah ? Look, that's what I've called you. I need you now. What for ? You have to go to prison. Fucking shit...Same shit again. For how long ? - Depends on when you'll finish the job. I need to find Broom...more than ever...especially his friend Uzhah. Well, then I'll go to prison. Won't be the first time either... Listen, I don't understand something. What have they got in common? One is a Jew and the other one's a fascist. They both hate Arabs. Really? Why? Get in. Hello. No shit. It's a brood-hen (spy). I am no brood-hen. What are you talking about, brother? I am no brother of yours, you stinking dickhead. A misunderstanding. You were put into my cell, not I in yours. Maybe you are a brood-hen. - Me?! I've been interrogated for 2 days and still haven't spilled out. And now they put me in with a spy! Listen...Throw it away please in the john. Now I see who you are! A lackey! The king of the shithole! But you yourself asked me to! And if I ask you to become my whore? Will you do it? Look here, dickhead. Maybe I should just fuck you? Enough! Hey ! What's up ? - All is fine, boss. Pechony, get out! Faster! I don't know anything. - You were caught red-handed. Anyway, you can't put me in. You've got nothing on me - just two sachets of stuff, that your guy caught falling from the sky! I haven't thrown away anything, and I don't know what he caught. Where is Broom? You mustn't do it, it's against the law! You have no way out. Two hours in the cell. And then you'll tell me everything. You're smart. You know what you should do. We got him. - And if he really doesn't know where Broom is? - We'll see. You. Will you get out soon? Will you take a message? - No, I won't. Only a couple of frases... - I won't risk my ass for you. Why don't you simply tell me what to say? OK, then...Tell him that the business by the river should be stopped. But the cops know about the river business... ...everything. Whom should I tell this? To Broom...Do you know him? - Yeah, a little. Where do I find him? I'll tell you. Vasily! Get him something to eat. Here, your food. - Serving me...you bastard. Bad news. They put a spy in Misha's cell. - And? Misha will tell them where Broom is. And then they will find you. Broom, that's your business. What should I do? - Spies don't stay put long. The most important is he should die before telling the cops what Misha told him. Can you tell me when this shit will get out? No problem. - Samson ? Our friend will tell you the exact date and time when the spy will get out. What's his name? Piotr. Take a couple of guys and get him right there, at the prison exit. You got me? Salman is waiting for you. Here they are. Thank God! We must reinforce the guards. I repeat - nobody should know about this. When we finish, call the police, and ask for reinforcement. But call them at the very last moment. Tell me please - is there a good library here? We only have the best things. - Bring me something to read. And what are you interested in? Something about your city. - Will be done. Hands behind the back and get in. Here he is. He tries to look like a real criminal. Go! Hey, brother, wait a second. Hey, friend, wait. Can't you wait a bit? - Piss off, you bitches. Can I help you? No...Messer... - Sorry? A penknife. - What kind of pen? Something sharp. A knife? - Yes. For fish or for meat? - This one. For meat, of course. That's a good knife. I would recommend you... It is sharpened by laser. Will stay sharp long. And you can also put it on a string. I will cut some goat's meat with it. I'll take it. Goat's meat... I need a shoe-string -One? But they are sold in pairs. For my brother. He is an invalid. He wears only one shoe. And what shall I do with the other one? - You can sell it to another invalid. Chupa-Chups, always with you. Chupa-Chups, it's so good for you. (from a TV commercial) Not good. Too narrow in the armpits. Wait a bit, you cops' bitch. Guys, you got the wrong man. What has Pechony told you? - Who? You will find out now who. Chupa-Chups. Good news? Your father will be transported on Tuesday, at 12 o'clock. Make sure your fascists are ready on Tuesday. Skinheads, not fascists. Fucking shit... a double murder. That's bad. And how do they know your surname? It must have been one of ours. Yes, one of yours. Quiet, quiet. Listen here - don't go home. Disappear. Do you have a place to hide? - With money I will be fine. Let me take you somewhere. - No, no need. I'll be better off alone. Hey, are you the captain? - Yes, I am. What do you want? We want to rent your boat. - And what is the cargo? Only a couple of boxes and 10 passengers. - No, this is not a passenger boat, only cargo. No problem, we don't need any luxury. - That's true. Don't worry, mister, all is legal. Here is your prepayment. What kind of money is that? - Take it, it's better than roubles. What is your name? - Ivan Makarovich. We will pay you the same for each day. - And when are we leaving? On Tuesday. See you then. - Remember! Fucking shit! Halt ! Everybody ok? -All is fine. - OK. Check it. They had a woman with them. This is handwork. Old. From Pakistan.Too expensive for a whore. What I cann't understand is why they are always one step before us? Because they are at war... And we are at work. Broom. He has completely lost his head. What are you knocking for? Don't you see it's closed? - Father, we want your boss. We are closed, I told you. The boss is not here. And what about Chief Mechanic or Engineer? - There is nobody here except me! Very good. Where is your boss? Whom do you mean? - Cross. Where are his people? I don't gather information on people. It's your business to look for people. My business is to make jugs. You don't know? Then meet your guests. On the market! There is a fight here! How do you know that? Where is that? How do you know about the fight? - Half an hour ago there was a call. Half an hour? I am on the market, it's just started! I have already sent all my people to the market! Even the escort to the special transportation. What transportation? They are carrying a prisoner. - What prisoner? One general. You know him very well. These are Broom's people. I understand now everything. While we are here arresting the skinheads, Uzhah is rescuing his father! A diversion. Nice job. Give them some gas. Fire! Arrest the skinheads! Here! Get out the ladder! Open up ! Father ! - Thank you son. In the car! Listen, shoot me in the foot, somewhere where it doesn't hurt a lot. You won't feel a thing. Who is that ? - Gladkov, Prison Security Chief. Commander, that's the major who asked your address. So, that's who gave the gunmen my address. You knew that Oduev will be transported. - This is not in your competence. Quiet! General Oduev was to be brought here for further interrogation. I had no right even to tell you. We could have terminated them all today. What's this ? - Some guard was reading it, maybe. Nobody local would read such books, unless they are crazy. Hold on, father. Where are we going? - To the market. There's a mass fight. - Yeah, great. An ambulance! Are you crazy or what? There are people with guns! Bring the father! - Hey, hey, What are you doing? Who are you ? - What do you want ? Why did you have to do that? Take the bullet out. - Impossible, he should be taken to hospital. The operation can be done only by an experienced neurosurgeon. - We won't be able to do that. This man also needs help. - He'll survive. Give it here. Hey, one moment, what's that? I stupid old man... wanted to earn some money... My ear hurts. Yeah, like that. Thready pulse. - I told you he needs medication. Listen... - What? He needs medication...Anaesthetics, antobiotics, a saline dropper. If he doesn't get it, he may die without regaining consciousness. Write a prescription. It's not so easy. He needs an X-ray, a lung motor, a heart monitor... You can't buy these things in a pharmacy! Write it down. - So you don't want to take your father to hospital. White it down! OK. Is there a problem? No, everyhing is in order. I just need to see if we have these things. Check out if something unusual happened today...kidnappings, stolen cars... Ask in hospitals if they have any wounded people, especially with bullet wounds. Yes...yes...that doesn't matter... What??? An ambulance? How could it disappear? Where was it going? To the market? No contact? No contact. Allochka, dear... Find out who was in the ambulance...yes, I'm waiting. Yes ! I understand. Hello. - Excuse me, Colonel. I'm from a pharmacy. I have here a strange prescription from Doctor Tomilina. With your phone number. Very well. I'll be there in 3 minutes. Please, delay him. But be careful, he is very dangerous. Come here. Come and stand by the door. There is a dangerous criminal there. The police are on the way. Come on, faster. Mister, you will have to wait 10 minutes... He pushed me, took the prescription from my hand and jumped through the window. And here comes this car, and then that... Is it what you are looking for? It's in Latin. Can you read it? What's the name of the boat? Looks like "dolphin". Yeah, "Dolphin". Thank you! You idiot! Why am I keeping you in the pharmacy? So that you would protect me and not growing your belly! He looked completely normal. Such an ordinary face. Who knew he would jump through the window? What did Fox say? The doctor translated the prescription for him, something about "dolphin", I didn't hear clear. So, Fox will get them first. I need Cross and the mafia money. Bring me my clothes, quickly! I have an idea. Oduev in prison was reading a book about our city. What do you think for? In our region there is a couple of places of interest, ideal for exploding. You know how they are being guarded. Call Voloshin, let him check it. Yes ? - Rubtsov, I am sending you a picture. The Dolphin? - Yes, call Nyrkov. Something's wrong. Grigory should have returned already. We'll wait. - For how long? Until they find us? Bring here our friend, the thief. Yes, I found...the Dolphin...berth 2...Uzhah's got hostages... I'm fine..I am waiting. Today is your special day, Cross. I want to offer you a deal: Do you know the water supply plant? I need someone who knows how to put a bomb. I don't have enough people. If you agree, I'll set you free. With the mafia money. I'll even double it. If not, I'll kill you...with my own hands. Answer him. He is talking to you politely. I am not a lady, I don't need your manners. And neither your deal. I don't like you, both. If you want, you can kill me - here I am. Or I'll run away. - Do as he says. Wait. Vasily! Why have they beaten you? What did you say? - The conversation wasn't successful. The port-hole is too small for you. - Doesn't matter, I just have to remember my youth. Don't come back until you do your business. You'd better take it with you. How are you? Why are you here? - I am clever. - I see Why didn't you tell me that it was Oduev? He didn't show me his ID. He has hostages...Lyuba. I am sorry. Metis, listen here: Cross and the money are yours. I must go on board. Alone, quietly. Cover me from here, will you? Come on. Litvinov and his guys are on their way. Do you have any weapon? What a tactless question! Take it. But you'll have to return it later. How long will it take? - Not long. Why should we use a mobile phone? Why not just a radio proximity fuse? The radio is for 3 miles. The boat is 5 miles away. And with a mobile phone - we can do it from anywhere, from any place in the world. And what is somebody dials a wrong number? It has 4 additional digits. Metis...you alive...good... Yes, I have reappeared. Not important. Listen. Do you know the water supply plant? They want to mine the reservoirs... And add something chemical...Yes, you understand correctly. Uzhah has already sent his people there. We'd better stop them. Good luck. Cross! My God, Cross, Where are they? - On the deck. Take a seat, we need to talk. Oh God, my ear is in pain... Hey you, disappear! Get out of here! Disappear if you want to stay alive! What was that? Cross... - Ok... Hold on. One moment. Metis ? All in order? Listen: if you find the bomb, don't touch anything. Better still - don't look for it. See you later. General Nyrkov please. It is urgent. Can you fix it? - All I can do... I have to replace the wheel, but where do I get it? This is not a nail, it's a mechanical part. I have to order it at the factory, it can take a couple of weeks, if not a month. Are you sure we cannot sail? - How shall we steer? The boat is not a log! As soon as we leave shore we'll be stuck! What do I need you then for ? - Wait! An extra hostage! Then take him downstairs. Listen, son, can't I stay in my own cabin? My ship's log. You and your people - on the logs. Akinov ! Find yourself a nest.And don't show yourselves - wait for the order! The rest comes with me. Be careful on the logs. First. Up, all of you I am at a meeting, I'll call you back. Here is a call for you. - Write down the names, but don't connect anybody. - He says you should know, it's Uzhah. An Uzhah Oduev, or something like that... You must answer, by all means! - Put him through. Who is it? I... am the mayor of the city. - Then listen to me. I don't want to hurt anybody, but if we are attacked... I'll have to make your citizens suffer. Why should I believe you? Go out on the balcony and count till three. I think we have to go out. Farewell, sister. I am counting...one...two...three... He is not bluffing. I don't think her soul will go to paradise of Allah. - Why not? The explosion was too strong, it will be torn to pieces. He is on the phone again! Yes ! - And next time there will be thousands. Let us leave quietly. Do you understand? Yes, I understand! Master, are you ready? Akimov, what do you see? A sniper in the deck cabin. 100% guarantee, I can work. Nr. 1, Nr. 1... the birds are on their positions, ready to work. Stay here! They have fired at us! Open fire! I said, fire! Voloshin, they have hostages! - We don't negotiate with terrorists! Fire ! Who is that asshole ? - Attention! At the pier and the upper deck, I repeat, at the pier and the upper deck...Fire! Give me the phone ! Boris Romanovich, a phone call. - Put him through! I am listening... - What the fuck are you doing, stinker? Listen what's happening here! Order your soldiers to stop it...or I'll blow your fucking city up! Voloshin! - Yes, General. - Voloshin, back off! Alexei Ivanovich... Hold your fire! Is it an order? - Yes, under my responsibility! Hold fire. Yes, sir. I am on my way. Are you alive? Alive? - Easy, man! Who is the guy? - My husband. Oh my dear. Sheriff, Master here. - What ? I understand. This is good! Boris Romanovich, they have found the bomb. Really? - Field engineers are on their way. What a mess! - When it explodes, it will be a hell! It is set to a mobile phone. Oh, I got it. I see... Slowly...Let's carry it. I'll make mincemeat of them! I am going to the pier. Where is she? Are you looking for her? Let go of my brother. Let him go or I'll shoot her! Now you go out and tell everybody to stay clear of the police car. Get all of them out of here! If anyone moves, you'll have to gather her brain from the floor! You will let her go on the pier. Don't aim at me. Come on, go! Go! Wait...put the gun down. Go. Father...we have to leave now. Uzhah, my son... I shouldn't...go to court... They make a villain out of a soldier... Set me free...son... I understand you father. What...have...you ... done? What have you done? It was our father's will! What's going on? - You tell me, General It's logical. - What's with the bomb? All is fine, we have cleared it. You take the girl. Uzhah, I'll cover you, then leave by water. I'm going out! Get back! Brother, get in the car! You are not my brother any more. Close the door. Metis ! I am getting old... Open the glove compartment! Shoot! All is fine now. I am here. All is OK. Metis...Please... If ya touch my truck I'll break ya face. You touch my truck, I'll break your face ? I don't understand - Do I love or am just used to it? It's not pretty. This city...awkward, hideous. Completely incompatible with life... People live here poorly, stupidly. They can do few things really well. They don't notice when they are robbed. They don't defend themselves when they are killed. If you protect them, they won't say thank you, they will get offended instead. So, why am I still here, year after year? Why do I do a useless job? I understand very well that I can't change anything... And? It burns. - What burns? The grass burns. - The paper burns. The grass smoulders. - Good for you! I have smuggled it! I would gladly make you a company but... Lyuba is somewhere here! Come on! - What is that you two are doing? It's a medicine, I give you my word! Look! Now I feel myself much better! By the way, the stock shares I gave you for the wedding.. They have gone up a lot. Don't you believe me? We are opening...Alpha Direct...Look for yourself! One can earn money without leaving the hospital ward! Patria muerte!
