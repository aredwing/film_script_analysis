And we can top that... - I don't have a husband. - Borracha! Vieja loca! Speak English... Get the hell outta here... You move the truck! Who died and made you boss? - He had a bad hanging-by-his-hair day. - Oh, that's Absalom... You got the spoon in. He got rocked literally. You've got it, sister. Manglehorn Lock and Key. You got your kid in there. Yeah. Oh, look at this car. How'd he get in there? Hey, boy. Okay, you know, your car is filthy. Your car is really dirty. Sucio. Sucio. You can't do that. Yeah, you gotta take care of these things, you know? Your kid locked in a filthy car. Let me see this. How you doing there? Being a big shot with those keys? Here we go. We got it. You okay? Now, he doesn't wanna come out. Look at him. He looks happy. 20... 20... 26. 30 will do. It's fine for me. You're too kind. Take care of your car. Okay? - Sucio. - Gracias. Limpia. Limpia. Okay? De nada. Dear Clara... Clara, how I missed you. You know, not a day goes by when I don't miss you deeply... without you to hold my hand to look at me with those life-affirming eyes. Those eyes... you could save the world with those eyes. You could've stopped evil dead in its tracks... if it looked in your eyes. Trouble never saw it coming. I just want you to look at me one more time. Never have I felt more alive than when you looked at me. I mean, I could always feel it. I'd give up everything... for one more glance. I'm a wounded man, Clara. I got... real pain in my heart. Look at me. Everybody's here looking at me except you. These people in my life standin' here... they're waiting for something from me. They're waiting for a miracle. They want something... or they're just passin' through. People everywhere... but none of them... mean a thing to me. They're not gonna distract me away from you. They're just not... 'cause I bet on you. Mornin', Carl. What's shakin'? Lookin' left, lookin' right. - Oh, you're tellin' me. - I know that's right. Morning, Mr. Manglehorn. How are you doing today, sir? Hey, Steve, there you are. There's a doughnut. I'm not gonna breathe a word of this to Collette. She will not know which night I'm gonna be there. - It's so exciting. - Oh, thank you. It'll be a great surprise for her. Good job, Dawn. We'll see you later. I'll see you later. - Well. - Ma'am. - So, how's it going? - I've got a little grandbaby. Oh, my gosh. That is so exciting. - 8 pounds 3 ounces. - My gosh. That could hurt. - Well, I don't know. - She's like my size. I'll take the next guest down here. Having a new baby is just so exciting. The next guest... Hi. How are you? That's great. Oh. Oh. Lawrence. Oh, yes. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Are we okay? You have room for me now? - Good morning. - How are you doing, Dawn? Lady? It's not even 11 and I'm already starving. - Don't tell me. - It's gonna be a long day. I can tell you. I'd give you this, but it's kinda stale. Maybe I go get you a Danish over there. I've already had two. Two, my limit. - Chief got back from the vet yesterday. - Well. - Little guy's gonna have to wear a cone. - No. Oh, gee, that's awful. That thing... I know. Poor baby. Look at him. Oh, gee. How is Fannie? Oh, not too... I don't know. She's seen better days, like me. She just won't eat. She eats grass and then spits it out. I don't know what to do. There they are, all over the world, the scoundrels, the lowlifes and... pets get stepped on. - Here you go. - Okay. - Well... - I'll see you next Friday. You bet. Hopefully. Yeah. Fannie? Honey, you around? Yeah. I know you're somewhere. Somewhere might be here. Fannie? So you're still all plugged up? Come on in, honey. I'm not gonna give you too much, just... just a taste, just a little taste. How'd you get in there again? Fannie, I know. You did it again. How do you get in here? You use your paws. You get in with your paws. I mean, where'd you learn that? You're Houdini. Alright, look at this. I'm gonna eat too. See? I got fruit. Nice prunes... and you got... What do you got? You got nothin'. You got nothin', I got nothin'. I'm starvin'. Oh, we got taco shells and pussy cat food. Damn it! - Meat, sir? - Yeah, liver and onions. Okay. Any sides? - Mashed potatoes. - Okay. - Brown gravy. - Okay. - Green beans. - Alright. - There we go. Thank you. - Thank you. I just want to know where you are right now. Where you are, what you're doin', that's all I wanna know. Everybody loves fried chicken. Chicken tenders. We have roast chicken. Any kind of chicken you'd like. Black-eyed peas. Everybody loves those. Candied yams, soups. We have vegetable soups... There's always tomorrow, but I tell you, Clara... I'm losing hope in tomorrow. And, of course, everybody's specialty... macaroni and cheese. Peas and carrots, cabbage, squash, and... It hurts... day in, day out. And beautiful memories of you walking toward me. Just one... painful constant reminder there's no one like you. None of them can hold a candle to you. You remember how you used to whisper about the future to me right before we'd fall asleep? I always liked that. You are a fortune teller... and a mind reader. And you were my own private president. Yes. Big money. You got that wrong, hon? Manglehorn. Hey, coach. Hit the jackpot? - That's it. - Yeah. Here comes that damn Gary. He just makes me so nervous I could spit. - I'll catch you around after a while. - Okay. - Remember, today is your lucky day. - Alright. Manglehorn! Manglehorny, it's good to see you. - It's good to see you. - Yeah. Good seeing you, Gary. Long time no see, man. Can I get you a drink? You guys know each other? - No. - Hey, hi. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Check it out. That's Jasmine. She's the new girl that works with me. - She is fresh. - Yeah. - I know. - It's been a while, man. It has, Gary. It has. You know. I'm doing alright, you know, just hangin' in. Just trying to play a game here. - There you go. - Okay, take care. When are you gonna come down check out the new salon? - Salon? - You didn't know? Oh, my God, I got 3, 4, 5, 6 tanning beds now. - That's good for you then. - We do massages. It's more than good. It's excellent. Oh, speaking of which, check this out. You know, I do 6000 crunches a day just for this card. Here, check it out. I look like a Lebanese strong man. - Got some nice tits in there. - You do. Just had it made, homie. Beautiful photo. Really good. No, seriously, come on, man. I miss you. Come on down, take a look. - Yeah, alright, Gary. - We're doing massages now. Real ho stuff. - Thanks, Jasmine. - Here you go. - Oh, well, thank you. Thank you, dear. - You're welcome. Good stuff, man, good stuff. Anyway, Jasmine, this dude is a hero. He was my little league baseball coach. Probably the greatest genius of little league of all time. And he had his little kid, Jacob Manglehorn his son, was almost retarded. The dude had like a hunchback, crow's feet, always sweating twitchin' out, nervous. He used to walk like a monkey. We always thought he was a queer bait but in truth, he was just a little guy kinda confused, and I feel bad about it kinda like a little Michael J. Fox bowl cut. What am I gonna do... Anyway, coach, I heard he's doin' good, your son. I heard he's rich. Is that true? Yeah, he's a real stud. A real son of a prick. That's how it goes, my man! All those nerds in high school. They read all those books, page 1, chapter 6. I have no idea what the hell you're talking about. Gary. Gary. You wanna shut up, Gary? - Okay? Just tone it down a little. - Nothin'. Nothin' resonates. Anyway, coach... sorry about rambling, man. You know, it's okay, Gary. Listen, do me a favor. I like... I enjoy seein' you, just leave me alone now. - Alright, man. - Yeah. No problem. Sorry to impede on your... good fortune, but it's good to see you too. I would be honored, if maybe tonight... you wanted to kick it with me and some of the homies. I got this mulatto friend who'd just won a half a million dollars in the Lotto. - Not tonight, Gary. - Alright... anyway. Come have a drink, my man. I appreciate it. I take it as a compliment. Dear, Clara... I've made so many mistakes and now I look around and everything's gone. Why didn't I stay with you? I'm a fool. The only thing I wanna do anymore is love you. I love you, coach. Even thinkin' those words makes my heart pound. Maybe tomorrow, I'll drive my beat-up old van home and there you'll be waitin' for me with a smile and a wink and I'll be okay. Maybe you're looking for me too. I'm a silly man with stupid dreams? You gave me my chance, and I put it out with the wash. My coach, my old coach. Coach Manglehorn, a living legend! Let's turn it up. Coach. Loosen up. Coach, how could you not love this? You were a star, coach. You were beautiful. What happened to you? All slumped over. Where's the life? You were a genius. We all wanted to be like you, coach. We wanted to walk like you. You were the greatest ever! - Gary, you look good. You look good. - Coach, you can hear me. Don't pretend to be deaf, you're not that old. Everyone loved you. The way you moved, the way you walked, the way you talked. You were smooth. Live in the moment! Yeah, live in the moment! Oh, Fannie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you last night. Well, what am I gonna do? Sometimes I just get crazy. I broke the toaster, too. Come on, baby, eat your food. Nice and tasty. That's what I'm talking about. I'm looking at it now. It's beautiful, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, look, it's not an offer that's gonna stay on the table longer than 24 hours. I understand. Yes, I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's in for 3 mill. I... yes, that's not the way this goes. The way this goes down, you count yourself lucky for finding me at this time in your life because you have a chance right now, right this second to be so rich, it's sick. It's sick. Stan, I don't convince... That's not what I do. You should convince me why I should invest for you. You understand? Does that make sense to you? Look, I'm gonna count to 10. I don't have time for this. I gotta go lunch. I come back on the phone, I want a yes. If I don't hear a yes, the offer's gone. You don't call me back in 5 minutes you don't call me back in 3 minutes. You got it? Start the countdown. 10. What is it? Bingo. Great. I'm proud of you, Stan. We'll go from there. Great work. Okay. Sorry about that, Dad. Just... real idiot. But he went for it, you know, so... He's a good guy, He's a... he'll learn. How you doin'? How you been? Great. - Good. Yeah. - Good? Yeah. Great. What the hell's that? My friend, the elephant. He's lookin' at you. That's some elephant. It doesn't... I don't know, look like an elephant, Dad. Well, it depends, you know. From where I'm sitting here now, looking down? - Yeah. - He does look a little like a baby elephant. But, you know, that's... neither here nor there? You like it? So you workin'? Yeah, I'm working. Sure. Of course. Work is good? Work is alright. You know, it's what I do. - Workin'. - Yeah. That's what we do, right? Why'd you come see me? Do you need some money? No. - I'll give you a loan if you need one... - No, I don't need your money. Come on. I just came to see my son, you know. I mean, you're never ringin' my doorbell so every once in a while I come around, ring yours. - That's all. - Yeah. You do what you wanna do with your money. You take care of yourself and you take care of my granddaughter with your money. Because that's what your money's for. - What does Kylie have to do with anything? - It's got everything to do with her. You don't want her slippin' through the cracks now, do you? You gotta give her all the love she needs. - Yeah. - Even if you have to pay for it. That's what it is. - That's great advice. - Well... You know who I saw? - Who's that? - I ran into Gary. - Gary who? - He asked for you. Gary, you know, old Gary... Baseball Gary. Remember? What's his last name? - Hodges? - Yeah. - Gary Hodges. - Yeah, there it is. You keep in contact with Gary Hodges. Why? I don't keep contact with him, I just... now and then I run into them. He's got this successful salon he's put together. See. There it is. He's a good kid. You gotta be kidding me. Well, he's doing nice. - Tan-Man? Nice? - His own business. Okay, this guy was a drug addict. Do you remember that? Gary was a drug addict. Yeah, I do. I remember it. He's not a drug addict anymore. He's got a good head on his shoulders. He's... you know... We have the same taste in music. And... also modern art. - Really? - Yeah. - You up on modern art? - I don't give a shit about modern art. I wonder why. You know what? Here's the thing. I'm just gonna be honest with you. Gary... he doesn't mean anything to me. Okay? I beat Gary. I beat him long ago. While he was washing cars you know what I was doing? I was putting myself through college, Dad, okay? While he's running a tanning salon, you know what I'm doing? I'm trading commodities with giants. So if you wanna parade Gary in front of me as one of your accomplishments, Dad, I'm not... I'm telling you I'm not impressed. Are you gonna talk like a jerk now? Is this what our conversation's gonna be? Because if I wanna hang around with a jerk, I'd just go... oh, look in the mirror... talk to myself. I didn't mean, I'm not trying to be a jerk, okay? I just don't know why you always have to compare me to everybody else. I'm glad of that. This food stinks. - It's awful. - It's expensive food. - I don't care how much it costs. - Eat it, Dad. Menu, pretentious. Conversations are pretentious. This whole place, overpriced. Emperor's new clothes right here. - Don't eat it then. - It won't be eaten. - I don't care. Don't eat it. - Guaranteed. Everything okay, Mr. Manglehorn? Oh, it's terrific, Rudolfo. Thank you, we're just... - just having a conversation. - Rudolfo, I would like a piece of chocolate cake if you got it. - Yes, sir. - Good. Thank you. And take this, Rudolf. He's not gonna eat it. - Okay. - Thank you. Never easy with you. It's never. Never easy. Of course, never. Dad, I don't wanna do it. I don't wanna do it. So you talk to Mom lately? How's she doing? I don't talk to her. I never loved your mother. The woman I loved slipped away, I let it happen. Got my priorities screwed up. My vision of what I wanted in life. - Well, that's too bad. - Yeah. - That's really too bad. - Yeah. Guess things change. You know, I don't know, maybe this other woman maybe she'll return and... then maybe you'll remember how to love someone more than an animal. You don't know love. - Don't tell me I don't know what love is. - You don't know. You're a son of mine. You should know these things. - I got a lot of work to do, Dad, so... - Oh, what else? It was great seeing you. Leave this for Rudolf. - Keep the rest for yourself. - I don't need it. Great seeing you, Dad. Really great. Your cake, sir. Yeah, I like it a la mode. - Will do, sir. - That means... Ice cream. Get rid of that orange stuff on the side, please. Yes, sir. Go ahead, don't you like the ice cream? - Yeah. - How is it? It's good. But do you know what my favorite flavor is? - Chicken. - Chicken ice cream? That's confusing. I like... I like vanilla. Vanilla? That's really confusing. - That's a strange flavor for ice cream. - No, it's not. Well, it's kinda confusing how the leaves change color. - It is. - How do they do that? Well, you see, something happens in nature because... - I think fairies do it. - Oh, you think the fairies do it. Well, sure, why wouldn't they? What do you think the fairies do to the leaves? They paint them and then they jump on them like trampoline so they look like they're gonna fall. You know, I once read a poem... and it went like this. Nobody knows the wind... neither you nor I. But when the leaves bow down their heads... the wind is passing by. - Get that? - Yeah. - You want to say it with me? - But in pictures... you can see the wind. It looks like this. It's a straight line and then a curl. - Yeah. - A straight line and a curl. And a straight line, curve, curl. - And you can see that? - Yeah. You're special. I can see that. Okay, here comes the sneeze. Now, if I sneeze three times then you go down. Let me see your sneeze first. Yeah. That was good. - This is fun. - You see that? - Once you start, you can't stop. - Do you wanna do it? Just keep going, yeah. You better let your balloon go, honey, before we get home. Why? Well, I don't know. You know, balloon belongs in the sky where it came from. - Right? - Yeah. - I guess. - So it's lonely. Homesick. That's right. Oh, that's good. Look. Thanks for hangin' with us. - Come on. You wanna drive this time? - No. Why not? You know, I gotta do everything. - Bye-bye, grandpa. - Bye-bye, Kylie. - I love you very much. - I love you too. Thank you for my lion. Oh, there was nothing to it. See you next week. Thank you, Patricia. Thank you, mister. See you next time. You know, I remember one time... that we went to the rodeo with your dad and your abuelo and me and you. - Do you remember? - No. Well, we went to that rodeo and there was this bull. The longhorn bull. It was... it was really big. He jumped the fence into the ring and he started jumping and throwing things and the clown went running and everybody was running and everybody was so afraid of this thing and nobody knew what to do, the vets couldn't help him and the poor bull was suffering and suffering and... Mr. Manglehorn clapped his hand two times... and walked to him... put his hand like that next to the bull and the bull with his big, big paw put it on top of the hand and the nail that was hurting him so bad and nobody realized, went straight to abuelo's hand. - Cool. - Yeah. And then the bull was good and relaxed again. - That's why I love grandpa. - Well, we all love grandpas. Abuelos. - Abuelos. - Abuelos are really good. Can you hear me talking to you, ma'am? Are you hurting anywhere, ma'am? You know what happened? - Mr. Manglehorn, good to see you again. - Good to see you. - Yes, sir. Have a seat please. - Yeah. Sure. I've got some interesting things to share with you about Ms. Fannie. - Okay, I'm ready. - Yes. Her vomiting... and lack of appetite... is resulting from a problem in her small intestine. She has swallowed a foreign object. She has an obstruction... that... is not allowing the normal peristalsis of the smooth muscle to continue. - What could that object be? - Well, that's a good question. And I'm sure you'll be able to recognize it quite easily. How she swallowed that, I don't know but there it is. And so what we're gonna need to do is a laparotomy. It's in a actually a very good position. It passed through her stomach through her pylorus and it's in the upper part of what we call the duodenum of the small intestine. This is a... another chart showing, in this instance a foreign object, which is a ball that's in this animal's intestine. Even in a sterile surgical setting there's bacteria at work in the GI tract so we're gonna need to compensate for that. - We'll flush her abdomen. - Yeah. Her blood work looks really great. She's gonna be a good anesthetic risk. - We're catching this early... - You're gonna get right through this. Very, very good chance that she'll... she'll do super fine. - I'll be able to just make a small... - Could you give me the percentage of chance? We're gonna make a small incision... I would say 95%. Excellent chance of full recovery. - That's all I want. - Okay. Mornin', Mr. Manglehorn. You doin' alright today? - Another day, another sausage. - You got that right. Little ol' sausage he got... I don't know what he doing... For Chief. - How's he doing? - So much better. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, the wound is healing. - Yeah? It's healing. - Yeah. Thank you so much. You're such a sweet man. She's a little drugged. It's starting to take effect on her. Alright, Ms. Fannie, we're fixin' to open you up, young lady. Pop that scalpel blade on my sterile 4x4s right there. Okay, don't touch nothing. Go ahead and get that t... tape. Be careful now. Y'all scrubbed her already? Alright, put that solution on there. That's what needs to be on there right now. Yeah, just drape it on there. Sorry to say, I'm gonna have to withdraw some cash. 'Cause I went for that second opinion and... you know, Fannie got some X-rays. Okay, we're gonna open her up... And now, they put me on the Total Care Plan. What's that? She had to have some involved surgery and so... we gotta pay by the month. Yeah. Not too happy about it. Based on our radiographs we got a foreign object that looks like... a key of some sort located in the intestine. We've got a lot of intestinal fat here in the omentum. - I'm so sorry. - So... Look at you, coming in here with a toy for my dog. It's a cheap toy. Picked it up in a bargain bin. - Well, it's the thought. - The thought. Yeah. We're gonna take a look here. Very nice viable tissue. Very pink and pretty with all the mesenteric vessels in good shape. And... there we go. That doesn't belong there. It appears... with our little animal friends that they're a lot tougher than us humans. A lot of them, after a major abdominal surgery seem to be fairly oblivious to real pain. And... this is what Ms. Fannie has gotten into. So, you know, I got... no Fannie for about a week. Are you just sittin' around on weekend? You need some company? I'm going to a pancake jamboree. You know, at the Legion, I'm going there tomorrow. See the old guys. I like hangin' out with folks worse off than me. Makes me look at the bright side. - I also like pancakes. - I've never been to that. Always meant to. Well, you should come on down. I think you'll enjoy it. Maybe I will. Numbers are still good, 96 over 168. As we close her up here, what we'll do is put absorbable sutures in the midline. She had no appearance of any intussusception which is where the intestinal tube envelopes down on itself just like... when you pull your sock off at night and it's half off and still half on your foot. The tube of the sock... - Give little Fannie a squeeze for me. - Oh, sure. - Don't worry too much, okay? - Yeah. I was sinking Deep in sin Far from the peaceful shore Very deeply stained within I was sinking to rise no more But the master of the sea He heard my despairing cry From the waters he lifted me Now so safe am I And it was love Lifted me Love lifted me You sad girl It was love Lifted me I said when nothing else could help Oh, when nothing else could help I said it was love Lifted Me Not bad? Very good. See you soon. Someone said, I thought it was you. I never said a word about bananas. Now did you hear me say something? Nobody gets it, except him. He eats a banana in two bites. How many people do you know who eats a banana in two bites? And he did. In two bites? And his name was Harry Belafonte? Not those little Mexican turds, you know. - The big Hawaiian chalambos. - I bet you I can do it. We'll get a banana later. Let me have this first, I just don't wanna fill myself... Why the guy didn't go to the carnival with that? I remember last time... You know, I was 8 years old when I went to my first carnival? And it was amazing, there were lights, smell of cotton candy in the air. That time I could smell, I had a sense of smell, I lost it. Oh, my sense of smell is not very good either. I've noticed. Anyway, I was really into it. I took my little sister and we went over to this ride called... Ride A Boat Across The Pond. And there were these kids in front of us. It was pretty sad 'cause they were all sick, I think. They had bandages. They had a nun with them. Meanest, ugliest face you ever saw. I mean, it was really mean. I remember being scared. Now they all get in this boat and they strap themselves across with the big bar. And they just take off. All of a sudden, boat starts to tip. It's real quiet and we watch this thing just tip. And then, bam! Tips over. I never saw anything like it. We just froze. Few seconds go by and this nun, she comes up under the boat and she's screamin'. No children with her. Just screaming, "Help, help." So few of the guys on the line did jump in the water start swimming toward the boat. They can't do anything. No children, just the nun. And so they start swimmin' under the boat seein' if they could get to the... to the little kids and just pull 'em out, you know. And this just goes on and on and on. It was like endless and they just keep doin' it over and over again. Finally this guy gives up. He looks over at us, says, "They're dead." - What happened to the nun? - All of them? Yeah. All the children were dead. I don't know. Sounds like an act of God to me. Yeah, well, how you ever gonna tell me there's a God? How anybody gonna tell me there's a God after that? No way. I'm just a hungry bear. Yeah, a few more. Say, you could... you could... Don't be stingy on the bacon. How are you doing... Dawn? Hey, how you doin' there, Dawn? Sorry. Nice to see ya. You made it out? Good seeing you. - Come on, grab yourself... some food. - Yeah, I thought... - I'm gonna grab us a table. - I thought I'd check it out. My mother and brother and I, we moved to Sacramento. Have you ever been there? Sacramento? - No. Never have. - It's real beautiful. - Yeah. - Big trees. What d... what did your brother do? Don't laugh, but for a while he was a professional mime. I don't know what's so funny about it. You said don't laugh, but it's funny. You're right. I just saw a mime. You believe it? Couple of days ago, in the park. - I mean, they used to be everywhere, right? - I know. What happened? - Lost art, I suppose. - Yeah. - You've been here your whole life? - No. I come from north of here. Yeah. I moved... I moved here about 40 years ago. Close to it. I liked it. I thought maybe it'd be a good place to raise kids. You know, I got a son... and a granddaughter. - You ever think about retiring? - Retiring? No, that'd be terrible. I wouldn't know what to do. And you know what they say "Idle hands is the devil's playthings." I would probably get into a lot of trouble like the man over there. He's a time bomb. Yeah. Hey, Ned. He's sweet though. Nah. You know what I'd like. I'd like to get in my boat. I got a boat. With Fannie. Get on the ocean and just disappear. You know, float away. What would I do without my friend around? You know, I'd be sad on Fridays. Oh, yeah. Well, that's... that's... that's nice to hear. Would you? Yeah? Well, it's good to know that. I'm enjoyin' this, you know. Sitting around with you here. You got my mind off a lot of stuff. Crowds' thinned down. There used to be a lot more people comin' to these things. Same amount of pancakes though. Let's do it again? Okay. If I could go back... if I could go back, I would change things. Every night I go to bed, I would wake up hoping things were like they used to be... like... we'll be young again. I don't have time to put up with it anymore. The world's changed so much and I've been around for so many years. Without you around, there's no point. I got nothing, but frustration... disappointment. I need you, Clara. I need you. I need you more than anything in the world right now. I look for happiness. Without you, that don't exist. You know... loving you... is the only thing I ever done right. No one compares. They never will. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. - I'm good. - Come in, come in. I want you to... I want you to see my place. Yeah, well, that must be the world famous... Chief! Right? - Yes. - Hey, Chief! Let me see you. - Be good. - That poor baby. Come to papa. You've... come here, come here, come here. Hey, Chief, say hello to me. I heard so much about you. Yes. The poor baby's gotta have this stuff. How long does he have to have it on for? Oh, just for a couple of more days. - Just a couple of more days. - Yeah. Hey, my boy. Here, come on. He's something, isn't he? Gee, sorry. Oh, my God. Well, I'm sorry. - Now, don't be. - I do it every time. That happens all the time. I put that in the wrong place. - But the dirt came out now. - You have a seat. Let me get it. - You got a vacuum cleaner in here? - No. Absolutely not. - I've got to clean that up. - I'll get that. Thank you very much. Well, it is a nice place you got here, I must say, it is... you know, you got all the knick knacks here. Look at this. You got a fancy clay collection and everything. What'd you do? Boost these things from Queen of England or something? Yeah. Look at this. I know this... this has got real value. I know these things. I like your shirt. - Yeah? - You look good. You do too. Thank you. You look... you look like a race horse or something. Yeah. - I look like a race horse. - Yeah, I said that. Well, there's worse things... - Things just come out of my head sometime. - No. I always say the wrong thing, but what I meant to say is you look really good. - Have a seat. - I'm okay. Would you like a glass of wine or you know, grape juice? Yeah, well, blood of Christ. Blood of Christ. I'm happy you asked me to dinner. - Where is your bathroom? - Oh, right there. Thank you. Two seniors. 20 dollars 93 cents. It went up? When did it go up? You people gotta eat too, I guess. It went up. 4 more dollars than it normally is. You believe that? How's the fish? Shall we go get a drink after this? Maybe see a movie. Well, you know, I think I better get back to... to Fannie and... I... I thought she was on recovery at the vet. Yeah, she is, but you know... she's... kinda lonely and then I've just... I don't wanna leave her there alone. They've got the 24-hour visitation, so I could go any time. You're a good man. I really had such a nice time with you the other day. I like being around you. Yeah. I'm... I'm just a person, you know? Well, I'm a people person, so you're in luck. Yeah. People. - Who needs 'em, right? - You don't mean that. Yeah. Well, you know, most of them. Don't be a grump. People are important. With... with... with people you... you have substance... and life's better when there's human substance. I love life. Like I'm a baby. I just... wake up excited everyday that I'm alive. I... I love everything. I really do. You know what I love? I love... taking baths. And watching the water come out of the faucet. I just sit there. - Yeah. - And think... isn't that amazing? All this beautiful clean water coming right out of the faucet stickin' on my wall. Simple things, you know? Big things. Let's take a bath together. Would you like to take a bath with me? You know, you're wearing this very similar dress... that Clara used to wear. - Who's Clara? - Clara. She was a very special woman in my life. Is this your ex-wife? No, I was never married to her. I was married, but not to Clara. Yeah. The other day, at the bank... Yeah. We used to do this. Me and Clara. Go out, have dinner... talk stuff... eat. She was... she was really great company. She had a certain way about her, you know. She was perfect in a manner of speaking. I mean, she was this giant ball of fire... giant spirit. I was very small by comparison. And she was always so interesting. I mean, she always had interesting things to say and whatever you want to know she... she was right there. I mean, you wanted to know somethin' about Vesalius. Or let's say you wanted to know something about Leeuwenhoek or Isaac Newton or whatever. Tina Turner. She was an observer, a great observer historian, life and people. Time just flew when I was with her. I mean, we were in a restaurant in Florence, Italy. Looking out, there were these children playing in the street and she's ordering off... off the menu for me and we're talking and we're talkin' in Italian, broken Italian and... then it's an hour, maybe two hours gone by, it felt like seconds. I turn around, everybody's gone. Chairs on top of the tables and there's just Clara sittin' there. Thunder crashin' and rain fallin' and she's... kinda burnin' against that... that tableau... talkin' to me... having dinner with me. I'm sorry I'm not as interesting as she seems to be to you. Oh, nobody is. I mean, not just you. It's just... They broke the mold when they made her. - It's just one of those things, you know. - Sounds like quite a woman. Oh, yeah. You... you don't even know, I mean... she has so much emotion, she was emotional... I mean, she tried to hide it, but... I knew. Can we talk about something else? Yeah. What you got? Hey, you know you got nice eyes. For the record. I kinda like your eyes. You know when I eat macaroni salad... I get bloated. I mean, I eat beets... I have instant diarrhea. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought this was gonna be something different... you know. How do you mean? I like you. You know, I couldn't sleep last night. I was so excited for this date. Just excited, you know, to see you. And now, I feel like you'd rather I just leave. Oh, no. I'm... I'm not sayin' that. You know, I thought you were a nice man but I... you bring me here... and I open up to you and you talk about a woman you're still in love with. - How is that supposed to make me feel? - I don't know. I'm not asking for the world. I'm not. - I know. - We've all had relationships in this life. You don't wanna cry, Dawn. And some things we feel and regret deeply and hold on to. But that's not what I came here for. I know. There's people sittin' here, you know. I came here because... I was hopin' you liked me like I like you. Oh, please. Please, don't. There's people. I'm gonna go. No, no, you don't wanna go. Don't... wait I'll just... You have no idea how humiliated I am. I'll take you home. Where you going? What's this? Allied Discount Tires. You know we sell you tires 5% cheaper than any of the other tire stores' lowest prices. You drive into Allied Discount Tires store they drive your car on the rack. They gonna give you great service. They raise your car up, and that guy gets in the pit. He looks up under your car, he tells you what you need and what you don't need. He don't give you no pit-bull. You know, tires are tough to advertise. It's easy to advertise somethin' good to eat, somethin' that smells good, somethin' that makes you look good so like I say, tires ain't pretty, but you know, it's very hard to advertise... Yeah, just... coming for massage, that's all. You know, feeling tense, very tense... and anxious and I'm tired. But I'm very stiff. I need a day on the beach. And I need to get back to... normal. Back to normal. - Anybody home? - Coach? - Goddamn! Is that you, coach? - Hey, Gary. I am so glad. - Don't get too close, buddy. - Coach, coach, coach. - Yeah, yeah. - Let me just feel. - Yeah, those as rocks. - Hard as rocks, coach? I promise you, coach, you're gonna love it. - Oh, yeah. Well, let's... - Come on, coach. - Let me give you a little tour here. - Yeah. This hallway right here was designed by a Vietnamese. A Vietnamese man and his wife. Girls, we've got somebody with a stiff neck. He needs his pores popped. He needs his pimples jammed. This is Coach Mangie, Mangie, Mangie, basketball... baseball, basketball. - All sport coach. - Hi, Mr. Mangie. I need to quiet... I need to quiet down. My nerves... I know it's funny. I get so funny about that. You know sometimes, we... I got some kind of control. I got some kind of control, but then... The floors are a little greasy, but it's vitamin B. They seethe from the sides. I just want a massage. I want to lie somewhere. Have my brain breathe. Just have it breathe. You're gonna enjoy this. This the audiovisual jambox. Wire music, right into you. It's pretty advanced. Basically it's 14 mega jams of slafee. I was perfecting a different playlist every day, but then we got these Mexican dudes who'd come in here and swamp the feel. Hey, coach! Coach, you're gonna love this. Wake up. Come on. Oh, this beauty right here is Joaquin. Thumbs up, Joaquin. He's my landlord, pay him off with suntans. Your time's up, buddy. Get out! A rabbit that was dressed like a clown, I wanted to be that. I don't want to be me. Right now, I don't want to be anything. I don't want to be a picture and I don't want to be me. - I just want a massage. - Dear friend of mine. Coach... loosen up. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm fine. I just... I was... - Coming in for a massage? - I was just coming in for a massage and... - Perfect. - I know Gary and he... Yeah, he told me all about you. - Yeah? - He told me to take real good care of you. Okay. I had a pretty stressful night. You know, I just... socially. And I... and I... and I got very tense... - Okay. - I developed a sorta... kinda tightness in... my shoulder. You wanna get a little bit comfy, maybe? So I can see those knots a little bit better? Come on. It will be fun. I'm... I'm sorry but I don't... Wha... what is that? It's some services we offer. I can just show you if you'd like. - You're gonna do the massage? - Of course. And then you can do me. What do you think? Have some fun. - What's on it? What's on this? - Anything you want. Some sensual stimulation? There's a gentlemen's massage, but I think you'd probably want something little bit. - I have to... I'm sorry. - Where are you going? Coach! Coach! Manglehorn! Coach! Come on, coach! Manglehorn. Come on! - Coach. Coach. Manglehorn. - Stay away from me, Gary. Who do you think I am? You to put me in a room with a lady like that? - Coach! - What do you think I am? - Damn. - You don't know who I am! Oh, coach. Manglehorn! Goddamn it. I just want to make you happy, coach. Come on. Come on. Coach. - Coach, why did you break my lamp? - I broke your lamp? You don't know why? - You don't know why I broke your lamp? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, coach. - I'm sorry. I'm... - That's making fun of me. - I wasn't making fun... - Why did you send me in there? - I was just trying to... - Why did you send me in there? You don't know better? - Why? Why? Why did you do that? - I'm sorry, coach! Sorry, coach. You look fine. Get up now and get away from the car. - I thought you want a massage, coach. - Yeah. Listen... right now, I hate you. I'm pulling out! Why do you hate everyone? Why do you hate everyone, coach? Listen, girl, coach is a good man. He didn't mean none of that. He's a man of miracles. I remember once we were playing. Coach was like... we wanted to call the game for rain. He was like, "Keep playing, keep playing, keep playing." Thunder and lightning bolts came down and... there was this little dog off to the side by the dugout. And I remember a little bolt of lightning just hit him, just lit him up. All his fur just went up and the dog fell... fell to the side and coach just bent down on his knees just put his hand out, and just patted out the fur. The fire goes right out and he takes his hand up and there's a flame shootin' up from his palm, and he just looks me in the eyes and goes... "Happy birthday." Just like that. He's a special man. Stuff like that never leaves you, you know. Yeah. Things like that, don't come every day. You don't look so good, kiddo. No, I'm okay. I'm in... I'm in a bit of trouble, Dad. - What happened? Kylie okay? - Yeah, Kylie is fine. You got anything to drink? Your house smells like trash, Dad. Well, that's nice to hear. Okay. What's going on? I'm being investigated. Investigated? - What did you do? Something illegal? - No. The people that invest with me, they know there's a risk. I took what was fair. I do all the work. They don't do anything. Don't spit shine yourself to me. I know what's going on. You don't know what's going on, Dad, okay? Okay. So where did I go wrong with you, Jacob? From the beginning. Oh, shut up! You wanna make me a villain, go ahead. But I was there, you know it. I was taking you to school. Back and forth, every day. Doing your homework at night for you. Coaching you at baseball. You forget 'cause it's convenient to forget those things. I know. It was tough. I thought having a baby was gonna make Beatrice happy. It didn't. It didn't work out. It made things worse and it was tough. But people got it a lot tougher. - And you did alright. Didn't you? - Yeah. You followed your own... Walked down that road even when I said don't do it. Yeah, that's right, I'll drink to it too. - I'll drink any day of the week to it. - Yeah. 'Cause I was right. - I didn't approve and I was right. - Okay. Now, what happened? You got everything you wanted? Yeah? Your nice houses, you got your nice... fancy cars, all those fancy people. And what happened to you? It turned you into a shark. And a liar. That's what it did for you. I'm just telling you like it is. You know, I'm no saint, believe me. I'm just being honest with my son. - I'm asking for help, Dad. - Help? What kind of help? I got a... I got a pull-out sofa in the house. You want that? - You want to stay here? - I don't want your sofa. You know what I want? It would be great if you could... could be a father. - What is that? - How about that? It could be "Okay, Jacob." It could be "Good, Jacob. It's gonna be okay." - "You're gonna be okay." - Okay. Is that what being a dad is? - Yeah. Yeah. - It's okay? Okay. It's okay. It's okay. You know, I don't know you. You pop in, you pop out. I mean, every time when I see you it's like... it's like... it's like changing channels. Most of the time it's... it's static. Everything is off! Like a horse opera or something. I don't even know what you're saying. You talk in a language I don't know. My assets are frozen. They... need... need some money. I don't have money. Come on! Money? Why don't you... why don't you sell that time machine you got out there? - Come on, Dad. I'm not asking for much. - I don't have money. Fannie's in the hospital. - Who the hell is Fannie? - Fannie's my kitty cat. She swallowed a key, she's getting operated on. - Are you kidding me? - No, I'm not. Why would I kid you? I'm standing here and I'm telling you I need help and you're talking about a cat? - A cat? - That's right. Operation cost a lot. - God, I don't... - So I don't have anything. You know what? Kylie's mom's not talking to me. I don't have anyone to go to, so I go to you. I go to my dad. - I'm here. I don't wanna be here. - I don't have anyone either. Who do I have? When you choose this life, there is no one. It's only you. Every man for himself. And let me tell you something. When you're sitting there wherever you are in a dark room suffering with the pain, guess what? There's still no one. No one answerin' the phone. No one respondin' to the letters you send. You are invisible. We're invisible. Did I ever tell you this story about me and my father we had that fight... before school? It's stupid. I came downstairs and... he's sitting there in the dark and he's tinkering with this metal box. There's no coffee made. So I make a comment and he... and he flips out. And he starts screaming at me, screaming his head off and threw a chair through the window. He broke the television. I mean, he's swinging at everything. He didn't... He didn't swing at me and... Anyway, I leave for school. He doesn't say goodbye. He doesn't say goodbye even when he's not angry. But I'm walking down the street, and I hear him in the house. He's screaming, "Hello." He's screaming at the top of his lungs, "Hello." "Hello." I hear it all the way down the block. "Hello." Anyway I go to school, I do my day, I get out of school. It's like a 180 degrees that day. I get home and Mom's there. She's happy. I'm thinking did she see the kitchen? How could she be happy? I left and it was a mess. And... I walk into the kitchen and there is no trace, man. There is no trace of his rage anywhere. Everything's fixed. The window is not broken, the cabinets are fine. He put his hand through the TV, the TV's working. It's like it never happened. He gets home, we're all sitting around the dinner table in the kitchen and he doesn't say anything to me. All he says is, "Rough morning." That's all he says, "Rough morning." I don't know. I mean... it's some kind of magic. Some kind of magic. I'm going to faint. Fannie, what are you doing? You are eatin'. I can't believe it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's good. Thank God. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. "Angelo. "I'm sorry. "You've kept me at arms length for so long... "with your distance... "circumstances and riddles left me confused and unsure." Hi. I... missed all the donuts. Running late? How you doing? Yeah. Fannie's doin' really good. She's eatin' and everything and recovering so nicely. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I'm a tough man to be around. I'm a... angry man. I'm very angry. A toaster burns my toast. The toaster's gone. I'll throw it out. I'll kill the table too. Yeah, but I'm not quite so angry around you, you know. I'd like to try things again. I enjoy your company. I do. I didn't mean to be rude. It's that easy? I don't know, yeah... what you mean? I'm sorry, but it isn't easy, no. So you know you're a son of a bitch. Yes. Yes, you do. Yeah. I'm aware of it. I'm a son of a bitch. Kinda. Who isn't? I like your smile, Dawn. I think... you are a beautiful lady. And I want you to know... that I think that. So what do you say? God, you are gonna have to work. Okay. - I mean charm level at 10. - I know. I'll go 12. - 12. - Level 12 with the charm. It's gonna take a while. I've got nowhere to go. I'm gonna clean the house. That's for sure. Alright. Get out of here. - So next Friday. - See you next Friday. Maybe I'll just come by, you know, tomorrow. Have a donut and some coffee, you know. Say hello. Okay, Carl, the world is yours. - Alright, see you next week. - Oh, you bet. Leave a message. Jacob, it's me. And I'm just calling to say... just leave a message on your telephone. I went to church. I tried to pray. And I went to work and I... I tried to become an artist. I think I'm gonna buy paints and I'm gonna try. I'm gonna paint on a big canvas. I'm gonna clean out my garden. I'm gonna dig up the roots. I'm gonna start somethin' fresh. And try nice foods for a change. Oh, you piss me off, Jacob, but I love you. And I need to say that to you now. I need to make sure that you know it. On the day you were born, I fainted. I just fainted. Who knows. Something overtook me. And I fell on the hospital floor and I laid there like a... like a rag doll. Your mother was sick, I remember that so I had to take you home. She couldn't leave the hospital, so I had to do it. And there I was on the bus. Just you and me... rolling along and listening to the sounds of the people around us. And the drone of the motor from that bus and the joy in my arm. You and I, we got off the bus we met my old friend for coffee. She looked at me when she saw you and she said... "Pal, you know what love is." You don't realize that everyone is jealous of how good you got it now. By that I mean how much love you have inside you. Some day you'll know just how good that is. I'm locked out. You missed. I don't speak mime. Oh, yeah, that's clever.
