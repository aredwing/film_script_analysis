The study of musical instruments is the subject for today. # The study of musical instruments # Is the subject for today # Did you ever stop to think when the band plays rink dink, where all the music comes from? From a toot and a whistle and a plunk and a boom. # That's where the music comes from Did you ever understand that a symphony so grand, so bright and yet sentimental? # Add a toot and a whistle and a plunk and a boom # How very instrumental - # For the horns go toot - # The woodwinds whistle # The strings go plunk, plunk too # Then the drums boom, boom with a bing, zing, zoom # And it comes out fine in tune So remember what I say when the band begins to play just where the music comes from. # From a and a And a and a # That's where the music comes from # Now, students, fly with me to the dawn of history. We'll start investigating the toot and the whistle and the plunk and the boom. It's very stimulating. Oops. OK, boys, you're on. # Goo ah ga ug # Goo ah ga uh When a caveman blew through an old cow's horn, right then and there the first toot was born. Duh. Now, let's look ahead in history, and here we are in Egypt, 2000 BC. # And now on the banks of the River Nile # The toot has certainly changed its style # And the kind of a note that the caveman blows # Is not good enough for the old pharaohs # No, it's not good enough for the old pharaohs # Now, the longer they made these ancient trumpets, the lower they sounded. One day someone bumped into a very startling fact. He had discovered that changing a trumpet's shape did not in the least change its pitch. The curled or curved bass horn had been invented. Ah. But this horn could produce only certain notes. To play a simple tune, you would have to use four horns of different lengths. Now, cut off these extra lengths, attach them to one horn, add valves to control the passage of air through the extra lengths. Now you can play your tune on just one horn. And this is a basic principle of our modern brass horns. Now, let's go back to our whistle. # Goo ah ga ga When this caveman blew on a tube of grass, the very first whistle came to pass. In order to make his cavegirl smile, he had to improve his whistle's style. And when he saw he was doing fine, he added more holes, about eight or nine. By using his head instead of his feet, some genius found a way to beat this problem in a manner neat. # Roo ah ga uh When our third caveman plunked on the string of his bow, it was the first plunk, as far as we know. # First you take the bow and sometime later # Add a little jar to make a resonator - # Add a few strings - # Listen, how it rings # Change the jar to a box of wood - # Slide the box down - # Ah, pretty good # Add a few pegs to tune it fine and sharp - # Change the shape a little - # Now it looks like a harp # Here there are two ways to go. You can either plunk it... ...or play it with a bow. # Goo ah ga uh # Goo ah ga uh From our last caveman with his rhythmic slap have come all things that click or tap. Came rattles, bells, and, we presume, all other instruments that go "boom." # With a toot # And a whistle # And a plunk # And a boom right from the old Stone Ages # Everywhere you hear a band or a symphony so grand # In music Oriental # The toot and the whistle and the plunk and the boom # Are very instrumental # Or the trombone's toot # The calliope's whistle # The banjo's plucka-wucka-wucka too # Then the drum boom, boom with a click, clack, zoom # In a Latin rhythm too # So remember what we say # When the band begins to play # Where all the music comes from # From a toot # And a whistle # And a plunk # And a boom # That's where the music That's where the music # That's where the music comes from #
