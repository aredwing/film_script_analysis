Vanish! Get lost! Are you deaf?. Disappear! Catch up with your people. Will you grow roots here or what? Hey chilli! Become air! You are the one l have seen in my dreams. Take me with you. Jampa. Why take her along? Jalan! He's lost his mind! Hey, come on! Hey Chilli! Hey, look at her! Drink this, the pain will go away by dawn. Standby everybody. Standby. Easy. What was that? Don't know. Come in. Closer. That's too dangerous. They will trace the origin of the goods. They won't dare to ... Like always, it is too risky to change now. lnstead, return to our land. Live happily! Let's get married! Who wants to return? You think those rich land-lords will let you live in peace? Then go. Don't let your present success erase the memory of why we left in the first place. We were outcast long before we became outlaws. The path we walk... knows no peace. Don't ever forget that. Jampa-la. Arrange to meet merchants. Same spot, ten sacs of gold. That many? Booty's up on us ... lbex-eye! - She's wearing our clothes. - Shameless. Hey chilly, come here! What's this? Ration for seven days. Are you chasing me away? l'm sending you away. Your people won't have reached far. They're not my people. l'm here to stay with you. That's not possible, your Highness. l can also do what you men can do. Can you piss standing? l can be of use to you. Of course you were useful to him. How about me? Hey! Girls like you are valleys: low, and easy. Who knows how many caravans have passed through ... You know that prior to last night... l was a virgin. Pity. Stop! Let her go, Jalan. Wait. What now? l wanted to call you but ... - You didn't know my name? - Yes. - Ushna? - Ushna. Ushna, meaning fire. You live up to your name. - l'm ''the flame''. - l know. Really? Do you burn? Slowly ... Not like you ... - They are laughing. - Shut up. You're jealous. How many? Oh dear one, least you can do, is love somebody, someday, somewhere is love somebody, someday, somewhere is love somebody, What are you staring at? The way l eat? Where do l come from? Where's my home? A woman like you should be at home. Find someone, marry him ... You don't know anything, do you? Watch your tongue, lady. Of what help are you to us? Whatever you say ... You said you can be of use to us. You've been looting the silk road... frequently used by traders? Yes. Have you ever missed a single caravan? No. But the silk still reaches the lndian market. There is one more route, through deep ravines, ice-cold deserts, through such high passes which you don't know. And you know it? l know less but understand more. lf you're wrong, you'll quit the gang. Jalan, learn to live with me, 'cause l'm never wrong! Crazy. Jalan. How long will we go on? There is no pass that we don't know. What's unknown here? We can still turn around. Have you ever been across those snow-peaks? No. Then how do you know what's beyond? - What's beyond anyway? - lf you don't go there, how will you know! We can't trust her, what if ... You see, Jalan? l'm never wrong. Hak-Chi! Hang out more! Show your hands! Do you know why is he named ''No-Smile''? No, why? Because he never smiles. He's named ''Hak-Chi''. Do you know why? Why? Twisted-hair, tell her. At the time of his birth, his mother pushed hard but he refused to come out of her belly. Suddenly, his mother sneezed ''Hak-Cheeee'' ... ... and he popped out like a bullet Oh, dear one, least you can do. Oh, dear one, least you can do. is love somebody, someday, somewhere. is love somebody, someday, somewhere. is love somebody, someday, somewhere. l didn't know you've such a beautiful voice! No. l don't. That's him! You may go now. Yes, there was also a stranger. A girl, who took a ride with us. She's been missing since then. What was she like? Hard to tell, she kept mostly to herself Too pale for a mountain girl. She never drank or ate in the course of days. You may leave. No. l want to look at you. Strange, you don't have the centre of the universe. Centre of the universe? A belly button ... You don't have one. From birth l don't. Then, how could you be born? Without it, how did you survive in the womb? Yeti ! lt's not a good omen. One-tooth, have you ever seen Yeti? No. But l am sure he has seen us. ls he really a giant abominable snowman? he loves alcohol. A rare piece! lt's called ''revolver''. Recently manufactured ... ...last year. Look, it's engraved here ''1835''. lt comes from England. Let's go attack England! Relly? Where is this England? There! You see those snow-peaks? Beyond those peaks is the ocean, Then another ocean. And then there is a little island in the middle of the ocean - that's England. l always wanted to see the ocean! Three gold coins and l can show you ocean right here. Do you believe me? l have seen the Ocean. Yeti? Why is he after us? Tashi! Jalan! Jalan! No, Jalan ... lt's dangerous! Clear out! Trust me. Nothing will happen to Tashi. l know Yeti's ways. She's right, Jalan, why would Yeti hurt Tashi? l know a place far away. We're going nowhere. That will make us really rich. Wasn't l right last time? Besides, there're phenomenal things waiting to be robbed! lt's a long arduous ride. Out with the love story. Tharchin! Tharchin! Water! Water! Empty! Nothing lasts for ever ... Where is he? Where is he? - Who? - Where is he? - Who, Jalan? - l knew it! Who was the man with you? Which man? With whom you were lying legs open! We should have never camped so high. Thin air is getting to you. l don't know what you are seeing. Maybe future. You look exhausted. Come to me. For the first time l fear our destiny. Don't distress, l'll take you to someone special. Ushna! Entering the village is risky! Nothing is a risk, when we're together. What you've lost in wealth, you will gain in health. Watch out for the pot! This one? No. That one. Your blessings, Onpo. You're welcome Never seen a face like this before. Strange. lt doesn't look promising. You two have no future together. - Ushna? - And three of us? l won't hurt him. Come. Now observe carefully and point out those with an abundance of good luck. Robbing other's luck will not take you further. Just concentrate. Come with me. Now. My shadow! ... more Chhang. We've lost them. No, we've found them. Now, all we need to know is where they are. What's going on? Packed to leave? Jampa? We've camped here for many days. lf we don't move before sunrise, it could be dangerous. You should have asked me. Nowadays, you're never around. Now, what's with him? Mortal snake bite. - When? - Moments ago. - What did you give? - Some herb juice. What do we know about this Ushna? ...who is blazing our trail? Whom we follow here and there. Without any questions. Where does she come from? Why she came? Scream! Go ahead! She has a complete spell on you. Did you ever think about it? Poison? Why do you give poison? Only poison can exterminate poison. How does she know what we don't know? Yes, we should be asking many more questions. Jampa! You should have left... when l told you. Why? Because now it's impossible. Leave the horses here. Leave us also with the horses. Why? Aren't you tired of looting material wealth? We won't accompany you, Jalan. Speak for yourself, Jampa. Ask them. We will wait for you here. But don't do a favour. Do wait. Give us your blessing. We want to offer you something. l need nothing, please leave! Please! Now! But, we need something. The ocean ... Jampa, what's up? Did you see a demon? What's going on? Jalan... Things are just not as they used to be. We abandoned our villages, our lands, because we were victims of injustice! We were oppressed, out dignity was destroyed. Thus, we vowed to live differently, honorably. Keeping our heads high. All these years we've been together, wandering the Himalayas ... That's enough! What ''enough''? For how long? Jalan! Whatever destiny gave us we shared everything, equally among ourselves. Joy, sorrow, daily bread, drink, loot. We shared everything. Now it's like every man for himself. You've changed, Jalan. l have changed? lf not, you'd have shared everything precious to you. What haven't l shared with you? Ushna. Who are you? l can't even recognize you! How did we come to this? Stop, Hakchi! For what? Our village is far ... and the ride is pathetic. What can be more pathetic than this? l'll wait for you here. Don't wait. We're not coming back. We lost her again. ls it real? Reality is caused by alcoholic deficiency. So let's have a drink ... Did you hear anything? No, why? What happened? Nothing. Nothing. Where is Jalan? Your form of sensual beauty is not enough to make Jalan yours. Where is Jalan? He is where he should be, and you should go back where you came from. Never. There is no future in your union. He belongs to me. And you? Whom do you belong to? l love him. Enough, where's Jalan? You should collaborate and return. That's what l should do, Yeti. But ... then l never do what l should do. Lucky bastard. Hey! His horse! Bring it here! Ushna? lt's a miracle, this boy is still alive. Medication has no effect. His lungs are empty! As if someone stole his breath. Where is its owner, where? Up there. Ushna! l'm coming. Jalan! What've you done to yourself?. l thought you had perished... Jalan, l have heard there's a place for us .... in the Valley Of Flowers. Do you know, Jalan ...when the wind blows through millions of flowers it sounds like ocean. l want to live there with you, until death. How about going through the Valley of Silence before going to the Valley of Flowers? Valley of Silence? l met this young disciple in the monastery. He'd escaped from a shrine in the Valley of Silence. There, a Yogi named Atman, secretly makes an elixir of immortality. Ushna? lmmortality? Deathlessness. Sound? Valley of Silence. No sound except human voices. We're voices. Come on. Ushna, leave the horse ... l'm scared, Jalan! Just follow me. Come on! To life! To deathlessness. For times to come. Your time has come. Congratulations on catching us ... Hold back! What're you doing? l want to make your task easy. Don't be ridiculous, Jalan! Ushna! l'm only trying to save you from yourself. You're making a big mistake. Things are not the way you understand ... You know nothing! Ushna. Ushna. Ushna. Ushna. Ushna. My intention was not to kill you. My intention was never to kill you. l can't think of no worse punishment than to let you live forever. You fucking bastard, Why are you here? l'm against what you do. Leave Japan! Quick, please! Konnichiwa. Konnichiwa. Toshiro. Chiharu. Are you certain? No! Please! Stop it! l beg you, stop. Brother, let me! Leave me! l can take care of you mum, dad! Please, stop it! Yuki. We are a burden on our children. We tried everything and every kind of medicine ... We no longer want to suffer in front of them... or anyone. Yuki ... Remember. Don't cry. We are all together on this. There is nothing to fear. May we take on the suffering of everyone who has this terrible illness. May they be free from this affliction and from their suffering. Come. Please, lie down. May l be a protector to those without protection, A leader for those who journey, and a boat, a bridge, a passage for those desiring the future shore. May the pain of every living creature be completely cleared away ... May l be the doctor and the medicine, and may l be the nurse, for all those sick beings in the world, until everyone is healed ... Just like space, and the great elements such as earth. May l alway support the life of all the boundless creatures. And until they pass away from pain, may l also be the source of life, for all those realms of varied beings, that teaches unto the ends of space ... Grandma! Excuse her. LET NATURE DO lTS JOB!!! NO TO EUTHANASlA!!! LEAVE JAPAN! Does your family know about your condition? Yes. My condition ... They know. Forgive me for asking, but what exactly was the ailment you spoke to me? Cancer. Cancer of?. Cancer of the ... Here, the liver. Hepatic cancer. Yes, yes, that's it. l can never remember the proper name. Yes indeed, it's always hard to remember what is killing us. Enough, Mr. Sakamoto. l don't do suicides. Farewell. Wait! Please! l can explain. From man to man, just hear me out. l've been hiding for two weeks. l can never face the world outside again. Mr. Sakamoto, with time, everything of this nature passes it's not worth ending your life over. l'll be the judge of that. Ultimately, you are the judge, but l'll not be a part of this. Wait! We signed a contract! You're legally bound to help me, and if you don't, l'll sue Valley of Flowers Corp... You lied about your illness. The contract is null and void! Now please clear out. Wait! Look at you, Bankrupt CEO fucks his secretary A coward, that's what you get. And look at you! You're scared shit, aren't you? You are horrified to face your own nature, like millions out there. You want to dominate nature ... by killing cowards. That makes you a coward, too. Where are you taking me? Let's go dying, Mr Sakamoto. Come on, Mr. Sakamoto. Come on. Come on. Jump! Jump! Mr. Sakamoto. You really want to die, don't you? You need to help me. l can't do it alone. Mr. Sakamoto. Just follow me. You can do it. We can talk... Mr. Sakamoto ... You are insane! Who is the coward now? ...the unknown man who fell 62 stories is none other than the highly controversial lndian Doctor, Jalan Otsal, of the Valley of Flowers Corporation ... He lies dead on the road. Otsal's practice of Euthanasia had drawn worldwide attention, and clientele. Although it is illegal to practice Euthanasia in Japan, Dr. Otsal could have tried to sneak ... ... wait a minute! Dr. Jalan Otsal is NOT dead! He's ALlVE! He just stood up after falling 62 stories! Perfectly unharmed! Unbelievable... You're under arrest. l volunteer to speed the process of natural death. l do not help people commit suicide. Where is the difference between speeding up natural death or murder? No words can explain that. l'm going to ask you again, and believe me, giving me these ridiculous answers is not going to help us, - Mr. - Dr.! l am telling you nothing but the truth. Dr. Otsal, have you had suicidal tendencies in the past? Yes. l've made 2024 attempts at suicide. What? 2024? Yes. Dr. Otsal, how old are you? l'm 197 years old. Stop. Release him! l know him.. Thanks to him, you're free. l have something to tell you. Ushna?! Ushna?! Jalan. ls that you, Ushna? No, Jalan, you don't understand. l've done some demonic things. Nothing matters, now you are mine. l don't belong here. We belong together. Once l had tasted your love l knew there would be no turning back. Since then l'm paying for my karma. To die, being born. To die again and being reborn. Transmigrating five times. Now in my fifth reincarnation, l can't stand it anymore. l remember absolutely nothing of my past lives except of the love and lover l chose. One memory, to carry with me from life to life ... The eternal longing. Even as a new-born baby l longed for you and your love. The center of universe. l know only one thing, today. What? l've been wanting to die for years, and now, l want to live. You will live forever... ...but l ...? For times to come. Please keep looking into my eyes. Laws of Karma. Laws of impermanence. One who can turn conflict into collaboration is the Buddha. What do you want? Why? Why? Why? Why? l am just doing my duty. l am just doing. The balance is restored. You promised me that you'll give us more time together. Your sacrifice... ...is your true love. Farewell.
