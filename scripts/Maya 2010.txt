I believe. When I think of my life I'm not afraid anymore... You see? From the first moment, there's a person. A world. She knows who she is... where she comes from, where she's going and she knows where she is. Keep working. You're on the right track... Me? - Yes, you. Blanche, "A Streetcar Named Desire" Tennessee Williams. When I met him, he was just a boy and I was 16. I discovered love all at once. There was something different about him. A gentleness which wasn't like a man's, although he wasn't the least bit effeminate. He asked me for help, but I didn't understand. I only knew that I loved him without limits, and then I found out... - Maya... That's okay. But you don't go on stage just to be okay. Acting is not just reciting a text from memory. It's nothing, only words. We're halfway through the year and I don't see any progress. Talent isn't enough, you have to do something with it. You have to touch, to move, to shock... You have to dig within yourself without fear. If you're afraid, go and work at the supermarket. Continue. If you go now, don't bother to come back. Where's the houmous? You want tahini? Maya. Aren't you working today? What time is it? - After seven. There you go. How's it going? - Not great. Mom, I'm at work. We'll talk later. Something happened? No, it's just... My boyfriend. What about him? It's haunting me. Excuse me... the check. - Right away. When I met him, he was just a boy and I was 16. I discovered love all at once. Check for table three. There was something different about him. A gentleness which wasn't like a man's, although he wasn't the least bit effeminate. He asked me for help, but I didn't understand. Mixed salad! - I'm coming. I only knew that I loved him without limits, and then I found out... - Mixed salad! What did you find out? I came into a room... There were two guys in it... Hi. Two specials. One Latte and a Filter. Anything else? - No thanks. Here you go. Afterwards we acted as if nothing happened. The three of us went out to have fun. We were a little drunk, laughing, dancing... Suddenly my boyfriend ran outside. A shot was heard... Everyone ran out. Someone grabbed me and said, "Don't go! You don't want to see this." Then I heard them saying his name. He'd stuck the gun in his mouth and fired. It was all over. - When did it happen? Omelets! Where's your sister? I told you to leave her alone! Cut! What happened? Can I look inside to see if she's there? No. Don't look! Okay, standby! We're shooting! Scene 17. Shot 1. Take 9. Action! Cut! Why did you stop? Come here, it's important for the scene. What? Who this guy's sister is? I don't know anything about her. Are you crazy? You stopped the shot for that? We don't have time for this bullshit. I have to know who I'm talking about! Imagine someone you know. - It can't be someone I know, It has to be someone I heard about... Are you trying to kill me? We don't have time for this bullshit! Let me finish this stupid shot! It's a stupid shot? - Of course it's a stupid shot! It should've been shot ages ago! Where are you going? I don't want to be part of a stupid shot. It's not a stupid shot. Come back. Get back to your positions. Enough already! Let's move on. I want to shoot! I'll get crazy by the end of the day. Scene 17. Shot 1. Take 10. Action! Wait, wait. What's he doing? I don't believe this! Why'd you stop now? - It wasn't good. What wasn't good? - My acting wasn't good. You don't have to act! Just ride the bike! I'm in love with the girl! You're not in love with her! I can't work with amateurs! Why are you moving? Get back to your position! I need professional actors here! Sorry. I wanted to go to the bathroom. You won't get anywhere without discipline! You'll always be a mediocre actress. Don't purse your lips, you're a statue. Come on, action! How was it? - I didn't know he was here. He's about to go. Aaron, Wait a second! I'm sorry. It's all because of me. It's not you, he's just selfish. They all are. - With him it's a sickness. They're all sick. What are you doing? I'm going back home. It's not for me. One day of filming and you decide it's not for you? I stood there like an idiot all day. I shouldn't have to do that. You exaggerate, you know. Actors fight to get a day of filming. You've done nothing yet. - It's not for me. I'll pay my share until you find a roommate. And what about your audition? - I'm not going. Of course you're going! You'll miss an audition with Hagai Tzafrir? Do you hear what you're saying? He's the new darling of the theater... I think I'm pregnant. Are you going to have an abortion? Are you crazy? With anesthesia? And raise a kid without a father? Maybe he'll leave his wife. If this were a play, it'd say, "Maya tries not to burst into laughter. And Nurit tries not to burst into tears." Maybe you're just late. - No, I'm not late. I'll help you raise him. Do you think he loves me? So why is he with me? Why not? Free sex, free coffee... the other day he ate all my bananas. After he comes he has to eat something. Let him bring sandwiches from home. I'm a seagull... No that's not it... What was I talking about? Ah yes... I'm not like that anymore. I'm a real actress... Now I understand, Kostia, that in our profession, whether we're acting or writing, what matters is not fame... or glamour I used to dream about, but the capacity to bear one's suffering and believe. I believe. I saw you acting... Blanche... In the cafe. That poor guy really believed you. I still feel guilty about it. You want to drink something? - No, thanks. Maya, right? - Yes. Come, sit down. I'm going to direct a play that I wrote I'm looking for the lead actress. It's about a young girl who gets pregnant. Her parents force her to have an abortion. Something snaps in her. She thinks they took the baby and hid it. Is it a true story? - Why do you ask? It's as if you're talking about someone you know. You're the first one to ask that. It happened in my family I'd rather not talk about it. I didn't mean to pry. - No, it's okay. It's a role you need to get into totally. Where did you study acting? I didn't really. Just a few months. I was sure you'd graduated acting school. No. Does it matter? I actually want someone with experience... but I'll think about it. Hello. - Hi. Sorry I'm late. - It's fine. Have you been waiting long? Just since one o'clock. I don't have a watch. You ready? We have onion soup... - We need to study the options. You know what you want? Usually, yes. I mean what do you want to eat. I feel like... A steak. You? Spaghetti with tomato sauce. You're vegetarian? - No. I thought about it and decided. The role is Nili. Are you sure? Even though I didn't study acting. It's scary. What's scary? I don't want to disappoint you. I suggest you read it. If you have any questions... I think I will. - I think so, too. Don't take every word I say so seriously. I might be right today, but not tomorrow. Sure. Let's continue... That's the real Nili. How are you related? - A cousin. I was in love with her. She was 8 years older than me. We met during vacations at my grandparents. She was beautiful. Then one day she didn't show up. The whispering started... It was a secret I wasn't supposed to know. My mother told me many years later. Her name isn't Nili. No, Tali. What happened to her? - She died two years ago. You miss her? I think about her. That shit hasn't called me. - He really is a shit. I'm through with him. You think I'll find someone who'll love me? If you get rid of Aaron. Aaron's over. He's dead to me. What's going on here? I don't know what to wear. - Where are you going? I'm meeting Hagai Tzafrir. Didn't you meet this afternoon? Yes, but he wants to talk about the play. I see... I'm not going. - Why? I think... I'm a little bit attracted to him... I like that "little bit". So what's the problem? I can't fall in love with him now. It could affect me in the rehearsals. I don't want to screw up this role. So what are you going to do? Put it off until after the rehearsals. I think it's already too late. Is it Aaron? Aaron's over. It's Shlomo. Who's Shlomo? Yes I'm home... see you later. What is it for you? The theater... Tell me. I don't know how to say it. Try. It's... It's... It's my life. It's inside me... Inside my body. It helps me to live. You want to come over? Why? It's complicated. Nothing's going to happen that you don't want to. But maybe what I don't want to happen, I actually do want to happen. Then maybe it'll happen. But I don't want it to happen. Then it really is complicated. Good night... What? Don't forget me. I'll put a note by my bed. Is he here? I'm done with him. - Already? What happened? You know that a cat knows he's a cat, but doesn't know he knows he's a cat. A person knows he's a person and knows he knows he's a person... So? He explained to me that when we touch he's aware of it but I'm not, and that creates a distance that he's aware of it and I'm not. So, what happened? - I told him to leave. And he left? I didn't give him a choice. Did you fuck? Are you crazy? - No Did you kiss? - No. So what did you do? - We talked about the play. I don't know how you can. I can't. Let's hope I hold out. Maya, you should sit next to your parents. Come. You found us a lovely daughter. Watch out for your father. My back is killing me. Ruby, I saw you in an ad for the health clinic. Five of those a year can make you healthy. Since when do you wear glasses? Since I started getting roles as mothers. This is the 7th doctor in my career. We'd like to begin. I'd like to say a few words. We have a wonderful play, excellent actors, and even a director who's not so bad. I wish us all good luck. Cheers! I'll leave you to enjoy your work. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to say a few words. You know what? Let's just read it. Dr. Giladi, Dr. Alon sit at the table. Nili and her parents across from them. Nili hasn't eaten for 3 days. - Almost four days. Dina. Why hasn't Nili eaten for 3 days? Nili doesn't answer. Why are you looking at me like that? Nili sits alone. The doctor and nurse enter. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in therapy. I can't be there. Where is he? I'll go get him. - You can continue. I can't be there, it's like a mad house. And where do you think you are? I'm sorry. Everyone's waiting. Ruby, go on. Soon you'll leave and go home to your family. With the baby. There is no baby, Nili. You know there's no baby. Now you remember what happened, right? I remember the butterflies that lost the light, and the red ladybugs that lost their black spots. I remember red clouds and my baby who was born and said, Mommy... Mommy... Excellent play. And well written. Meet Dr. Biran. Head of the psychiatry ward at the hospital. He'll be helping us. - Nice to meet you. Sorry. The doctor's a little sick. You've got a serious challenge. I'll have a lot of questions for you. If I have answers, I'll do my best. I brought a book that might help. What do you think about letting Maya spend some time at the hospital among the patients without them knowing that she isn't sick. I hope it doesn't frighten you, Maya. I think it could help. What do you say? Why not? It's like asking me to betray my profession. There's is so much prejudice about the mentally ill. We can to show them here in a different light. Yes, but I can't admit an actor to the ward as a patient. I'll be happy to get advice from you, too. You already look pretty convincing. Okay, we're done for today. Riki will let you know about the rehearsals. It's important to memorize the text. Now? I can, but... No, I want to but... In five minutes? Okay. I have no character, do I? It's not about character. It's the law of nature. Yes. On second thought, I can't come. My roommate has a fever I can't leave her alone. You want me to bring her Tylenol? Nurit, you have Tylenol, right? Yeah, she has some. Well, good night. Good night. Where is he? - Who? He was here. It was a dream. No. Good, Maya. Your waking up is good. But, when you're looking for the baby I see only the motions. It has to be more real for you. You have to understand what this baby is. To understand what a missing baby is, you must understand what it is to have a baby. It comes from the body, not from the mind. Yes. Nili, come to breakfast. Help me look for him. Good, but look on both sides. She could come from the other side. Should I wait with the line? Let her first search on the other side. Why is she asking for help? Until now she didn't want to speak to anyone. It's not "she", it's you. You. Only you. You have to think Nili's thoughts. To say: I am Nili. It'll help. I understand... I am Nili... I don't know how to do it. Dr. Biran... I wanted to ask you... Hagai is right. It could help me if I'd spend some time in the hospital... I don't want to be wrong with this role. I haven't slept for nights. I can't explain how important it is to me. What do you say? Let me think about it. I won't bother anyone. See you later. Blessed art thou, lord, king of the universe, who gives us the fruit of the vine. - Amen. Hand washing. Where are all the eggs? Grandpa... Grandpa ate the eggs. Grandpa, where are all the eggs? He said buy eggs. He said it's closed. I don't know how he didn't choke. He's strong as a horse. He said I'm sailing on a boat... To Istanbul! Grandpa Come to bed. I'm getting married tomorrow. To whom? - We'll see. I had another one. What? - Hand. You had three hands? Of course. Grandpa! Be passive, listen to them... Observe them. It'll be alright. Come to see me later. Irit, give me your mug. What's your name? Maya. What's your thing? Everyone's got a thing here. Gabi thinks he's a heart surgeon. Irit thinks if she lines all up her father will love her. Gil's a soldier. It's a secret. He doesn't say anything. Yardena thinks her mother wants to get into her stomach. Carlos thinks he's a snake. Carlos, como esta? So what have you got? Anat, go back to your place! Don't get excited... That's her thing. Girls. That's why they locked her up. That's not why they locked her up. - Really? Why? Because she puts out cigarettes on her ass. Anat, enough! What? I deserve a little action. What happened, Anati... The doctor? What a dream I had about him... She's in love with Dr. Biran. What about you? - What? What's your case? They took my baby. - You have a baby? Yes. They took him. - Why? They say he isn't mine. - I get it. Someone has a baby and you think it's yours. He's mine. Maternal fixation. How can you tell? I understand these things. From what you've told me, plan to be here a long time. You don't usually recover from it. If someone decides he's John Lennon or Jim Morrison or that he has a baby, It's a long story. Very long. If you want to get out of here quickly, tell them you know it isn't your baby. That you merely said it. So why don't you tell them you're not a heart surgeon? With me it's different. I don't have what everyone has. I really am a heart surgeon... I want my baby! Give me my baby! That's not bad, but on that line, run to the other side of the stage as if you see someone there holding your baby. It's your baby. Nili, what happened in high school? I don't know... I don't know... I want my baby, give me my baby! No, it's not right. I can't run. Why not? It was great. Because of the pills I'm taking. What pills? - In the hospital. I can't run. I'll fall. Maya, it's a play. It has to be dramatic. Is it okay for me to stand here like an idiot? Why? You want to see what's happening to her. Maybe he goes to her, and tries to stop her. Okay, give it a try. One more time from the same place. Medically speaking, she's right. Dramatically, this is much better. I want to emphasize her obsession. The running does that. You've to choose if you want drama or truth. I want them both, and I'll get them. What happened? I bent his car key. - Whose? The Arab. At the checkpoint. It's just a dream. It's not so terrible. It is terrible. They're always chasing me. - Who? The keys, the documents, the chickens, the children. Did you tell the doctor? Why do you think I'm here? - I don't know. I lost my sense of judgment. I can't tell a human from an Arab. My mother couldn't tell between me and the cats. She'd give them the cocoa and me the milk. There's hot tea. Come and drink. You're going home again today? I'm only here as an out patient. I ask myself why he needed the samovar... What are you talking about? An Arab at the checkpoint, couldn't go through the turnstile with his samovar. The solider said he'd get it back on the other side. After he got through, he asked for the samovar. The solider told him: "I already gave it". Who'd he give it to? To another Arab. - Why? He can't tell them apart. What did the Arab do? He begged to get his samovar back, the soldier hit him in the head with the rifle. Did you see it? - Yeah. And you didn't do anything? - I did. What? I pointed my gun at the soldier. And shot? I didn't get a chance to. The other soldiers hit me. When I woke up in the clinic, the doctor said that I'd lost my sense of judgment that it's serious, but they might cure me. Am I going home today? - You don't have a home. Why did you enlist? Were you afraid to go to jail? I was afraid of my father. But it's your life, not your father's. - I know. So if you know... - It doesn't help. Parents get stuck in your throat. You can't swallow and you can't throw up. Maybe they should be treated, not you. How did you know when I was leaving? I guessed. Where are you? These people... In the end you'll like it and want to stay there. You want something to drink? Where are you? I have no character. You regret it? I don't want to see them! They'll take the baby from me! What happened? I think it'll be truer if I don't shout... No, her parents are her enemies. They throw her off balance. They're still her parents! Maya, you see everything through your character. That's fine, but there are other elements here, that work together like an orchestra. Every musician is a part of the orchestration. I'm building a concept that's going somewhere. You have to trust me. Like all the others do. I hope. Sure... I trust you. Don't worry if it's good or bad. You're stopping yourself. It's a shame. Open up... Open up... Even if it looks bad to you. Okay, again from... - You'll have a visit today. Go ahead. You'll have a visit today. - Who? Your mother and father. No, I don't want to see them! They'll take the baby from me! You don't have a baby, Maya. You know that. I want the baby back! He needs me. I'm his mother... I'm his mother. You have no reason to stroke her head, Ruby. It was fine. I'm not sure crying is right here. You tell me to open up, and now you don't like it. It's not about liking it or not. There has to be a reason. Why do you think she cries here? Because she's in love with him. With who? - With the doctor. Why she's in love with the doctor? You're angry at your parents. They want to take your baby. Since I'm alone here I'm dependent on the doctor. I see it in the hospital. A lot of times it's really love. If I wanted Nili to be in love with the doctor, I would've written it that way. Maybe she's right. There's something touching about her crying. It's effective. Maybe she's' in love with the doctor, and the doctor understands... and loves her too... No? You don't think so... Honestly, I don't think so. Let's do it again from the beginning. Can we take a five-minute break? Take five minutes. I feel like I'm losing you, Maya. You have to stop going to the hospital. You sent me there. I know. I made a mistake. It's only making you worse. It's not making me worse. It's making me truthful. You always say how important truth is. Truth isn't chasing after what's truthful. Acting is acting. A play is a sum of things not necessarily true, which create a certain truth. But there are things that aren't right. What isn't right? What isn't right? When the parents are supposed to come, you make me hysterically crazy and... What? - It's fake. Let me decide if it's fake or not. You aren't even trying things through. How can you tell if it's fake or not? I can't do things that don't feel right. It doesn't come from the head, I feel it in my stomach. We're done for today. You wanted to run the scene. - We'll do it tomorrow. We're through for today. See you tomorrow at ten. Don't be angry at me. I'm helpless. These discussions are exhausting me. I want to enjoy what I do, not suffer from it. I don't know what to say. It's not about what to say, it's about... That I'm going to ruin the play. If it goes on like this, that's what'll happen. Maybe you should replace me. Replace me. I don't want to do this role. Find another actress. I wouldn't replace you for anyone else in the world. This is exactly what I was afraid of. - Of what? That our relationship would ruin everything. What has our relationship ruined? I'm not good enough, and you don't dare to replace me. You're talking nonsense, you know? I don't want to be in the play just because you love me. Okay... I'm leaving. I don't want to do this role. Find someone who won't ruin the play. Enough! I can't take this anymore! What are you going to do? Shouldn't you replace her? If the show is important to you, you have to keep all your options. Mom... Everything's fine. Everything's fine! Mom! I think I'm pregnant. Is that why he left? No. I'm keeping the child. I decided. Did you lock the door? - Yeah. You know who the father is? It could only be Shlomo. How can you be sure? The last time I slept with Aaron was before my period. What does Shlomo say about it? He actually likes the idea. Then take a test. - Tomorrow. I'm making tea, you want some? - No. Should I turn out the light? - No. Did something happen? - I'm leaving the play. What?! What happened? I'm not good, I'm ruining Hagai's play. But you're always saying how great everything is. What happened all of a sudden? We don't see things the same way. He doesn't care about the truth. He cares about the dramatic effect. Well, he's right, it's theater. - I know it's theater. Can't you talk about it... Reach an understanding? No. How is he taking it that you're leaving? I didn't tell him yet. I suggest you don't tell him. It seems you're just in a bad mood. I don't know. I can't handle it. I don't get him. Maybe he's panicking. But what about you two? - What? You're lovers... Aren't you lovers? Of course. That's the problem. Did you close the terrace door? - I closed everything. What? Now? What happened? Aaron's wife left him. Now he wants to marry me. So why are you crying? Because I have a new lover, and I'm pregnant. I killed Aaron's child and blew $2000 on a shrink! Now he wants to marry me?! I don't want to. So tell him to go to hell. But I love him. I was up all night. - Me too. We could've been up together. I wanted you to have time to think. What did you think? About what? About me. The role. I don't have any doubts. You'll be wonderful. You're the best actress I know. Really? Really. Just forget everything and trust me. Okay? - Okay. I missed you so much. - So did I. Hello everybody! Okay everybody! I want to begin. Can I check the length of her nightgown. Excellent. That's excellent. I want to begin. Ruby, Maya, Orit, concentrate! Where are the pills? Nili, give me the pills. Maybe I don't give him the pills. - Why? Maybe when they ask her for something, her hands freeze. She can't let go. Where's this coming from? Okay, so no. Ruby, one more time. "Give me the pills". Please, give me the pills. You see, she gives up the battle, and gives him the pills. Soon you'll go home, to your family... With the baby. - There is no baby. You remember who you are now, right? I remember the butterflies who lost the light, the red ladybugs who lost the black spots... Maya, it has to be with passion. She gave up the battle, but she still has a vision that takes her outside the hospital... Passion! I remember the smell of the trees, the color of the sky... I remember red clouds and my baby who was born and said, Mommy... Ruby, Ruby, why?! You've got to stand like a statue until the curtain closes. She was simply wonderful. - Open the curtain! We can't end the play like that. There's no energy... It's not the right text for the ending. What's the right text? What Nili should say here? That they don't believe her, that they don't want to help her. That... she can't do what they want. When you'll write a play end it your way. But now, it needs to be convincing. The premiere is in a week and I don't see the role. It worries me. Don't worry. It'll be fine on opening night. Again from the same place. She's going to give me a heart attack. You should've taken someone experienced. It's not too late. We can replace her. I'm even willing to delay the show. You have a wonderful play. It's a shame. She'll be great. You'll see. Let's hope. Good luck. Is everything okay? Show her love. Good luck. Bring the lights up slowly. Go with what you feel. Forget everything I told you. You'll be wonderful. Remember that I love you. Good luck. Be ready with the lights. Hello. - Hello, doctor. Nili hasn't eaten for 3 days. Almost 4 days. - Dina! Why hasn't Nili eaten for 3 days? Why are you looking at me like that? Tell Doctor Giladi why you aren't eating. Nili, do you want to tell me? We want to help you. You all think that I'm crazy. No one thinks you're crazy. We want to help you from what you've suffered. I don't need to be here for that. I can be at home. You have to be watched. You'll be taking pills. I don't want pills. I won't let you drug me! You want to kill me? Is that what you want? Nili... honey... - Dina! Why are crying? You're locking me up and you're crying? If you leave me here, you'll never see me again. You' II never see me again! You're not my parents! Let me go! Let me go or I'll kill you! Where are you? Where are you? Nili... Nili, look who came. Who's he? Nili... I'll leave you alone. She'll speak to you in a minute, right, Nili? What's your name? Roni. He's cute. - Why don't you talk to him? I don't know him. Nili, it's me. Are you hiding him? He is with you. You're hiding him at your place. He's charming. - He's sweet. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in therapy. I can't go there. It's like a mad house. Where do you think you are? You'll have a visit today. Who? - Your mother and father. I don't want them to come! I don't want to see them! Don't let them in! They'll take my baby! You don't have a baby, Nili. You remember you don't have a baby... You had an abortion, right? They killed him! They want to help, they love you. They don't love me. I want them to give me my baby back. He needs me, I'm his mother. He needs me, I'm his mother. He needs me... I'm his mother... Let's go back... Try to remember. Your mother is Dina, your father Yuval. Right? You lived in Herzliya. Remember? Near the sea. - Near the sea, right. You went to kindergarten. What was the teacher's name? Edna. - Edna, that's right. You moved to Tel Aviv. Yes. Tel Aviv. You studied at the Pardes School and went to Yanai High School. Yanai High School? What happened in high school? What happened in high school, Nili? I don't know... I don't know. I don't know... I want my baby. Give me my baby. Come, let's go to therapy. He's getting closer. You hear? Who's getting closer? I hear him. What do you hear? - He's calling me. How does he call you? How does he call you? Mommy... Mommy... She didn't run. I saw. - She wept and took his hand. Stop this nonsense. She's great. She's electrifying. I told you. Forty-five... Nili, where are the pills? Where are the pills, Nili? Give me the pills. Nili, please give me the pills. Soon you'll go home to your family... Nili... Nili, do you hear me? You'll go home to your family and friends... Nili... Keep going. You remember that you don't have a baby, right? You remember that you had an abortion. Nili... You remember, right? You remember that you don't have a baby. You remember you had an abortion. Right? What should I do? - Say butterflies. I can't anymore. I can't do what they want. Close the curtain! - No, no. Don't close it! I'm sorry... I can't do what they're asking me to do. Close the curtain! - No! I'm sorry. I can't do what they want. No, I can't do it. I can't do it. I'm sorry. Now you can close it. Ruby, go to the other side. Actors, get ready to bow. I'm opening the curtain. Hagai, go bow. Run to the stage! I'm not bowing. It's not the play I wrote. Are you crazy? Run out on the stage! I told you at the first reading. Terrific, huh? Come Maya, they want you on TV. I don't want to. - You have to come. Leave her alone. We'll do it tomorrow. You have to go on TV. Are you disappointed with me? Are you mad at me? You were wonderful! Meet Hagai. Well done! Where are you? I'm a little confused. I can't figure out how much was intentional and how much wasn't. You did it on purpose. - No, I didn't. You decided to change the play in cold blood. Let me explain. There's nothing to explain. You knew what this play meant to me. Let me explain! You stepped on me because I love you. Let me explain! That's it, Maya. It's over. What's over? It's over. His wife went back to him? Call Shlomo, tell him to come, before it's too late. He's already on his way. You were great. Great... Where's Hagai? I want to tell him It's the most beautiful play I ever saw. He's not here. Where is he? What happened? Maya! Why are you standing over there? You haven't eaten all day, give some to that nice guy. Please have some. It's delicious. Gabi Modan, heart surgeon. Nice to meet you. Here's the doctor... Doctor Biran... - How you doing? My mother... - Nice to meet you. My father... - Nice to meet you. My grandfather... - The doctor. Thank you. I'm Dr. Biran. Thank you for everything. Really, thanks. Thank you. I feel like I haven't thanked you enough. Hagai called me. - What did he say? I understand that you... - Yes. He feels I betrayed him. I didn't. You knew what you were doing. I knew, but... - What? There was something stronger than me. As if Nili took control of me... I felt like drowning. - And... I stopped. It scares me now. Maybe I'm going insane. Quite the opposite. Your instincts didn't let you go insane. But if it happens again... I'm afraid I'll be like them. There's a difference between you and them. What difference? You have a curtain at the end that brings you back to life. They don't. I remember the butterflies that lost the light... the red ladybugs that lost the black spots. And the bees whose wings were stolen... I remember... Don't worry. Tonight I'll do everything as it's written. I want you to do what you did yesterday. I don't know what I did. I can't repeat it. You're an actress. You can. Translation: Paul Fischer Cinematyp Studios Ltd.
