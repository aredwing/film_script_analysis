Always wanting to kiss. Slowpoke. Wait a minute, will you? I want to talk to Eddie. Well, hurry up. What are we gonna do about this? Why, you egg. You mean to tell me you haven't raised that dough yet? I thought I had a job this afternoon caddying, but I didn't get out. Listen, I got an extra half. You can have that. Where will I get the other quarter? - I got it. - What? Harriet. - What about her? - Well, listen. I can get you in and it won't cost you a cent. Hey, Harriet, come here. - Hi, Joe. - Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Stop the shoving. These three with you? Yeah. Frank and Tommy's coming right in. Okay, boy. Hi, kiddo. - Hello, Tom. - Hello. - Say, you wanna dance with Harriet? - I'm sorry. I got a sweet mama over there waiting for me, boy, and she a honey. Mm-mm. Hi, Fred. Say, you wanna dance with Harriet? Hello, Joe. Nice crowd, huh? - Say, do you wanna dance with Harriet? - Where's your ticket? Ticket? What ticket? Listen, boy, don't horse around with me. Mr. Mackintosh here told me how you got in. Say, listen, Joe, have a heart. I'm broke, but I'll get the money for you somehow. I'm sorry, but you know what we said at class meeting. Hey, Ralph. - Oh, now, look, fellows. - Come on, Ralph. Out with him. Hey, look! Don't put me out, Joe. I'm not dancing, am I? I only came because Harriet wanted to come. She didn't have anyone to bring her. You're talking to Simon Legree, boy. Come on, out. Hey, you eggs, what's the idea? Don't let them get rough. Take a poke at somebody. Now, wait a minute, Eddie. Don't start a fight here. He hasn't any ticket. Okay, if he hasn't got a ticket, he'll go out. But he'll walk out, see? - Harriet, Grace, come on. What's the matter? Come on, everyone. Oh, gee, Eddie, you make me feel like a heel, spoiling all your fun. Forget it. The music wasn't so hot anyway. It was awful to dance to. Didn't you think so? I don't know. I didn't get a chance to try it. All I did was lose my hat and coat. I hid them. But I'll get them for you tomorrow. Last one in the bus is a rotten egg. Hang on, kids. Here comes the anchor. Oh, heck. - What's the matter? - Somebody stole our gas. - Come on. - Get out. Hey, there's one over there. Aw. That would be like stealing milk from a baby. Oh, come on. Come on, put it in. Well, put it in. There goes half of it. Say, where are we going tonight? I don't know. Maybe we'll go downtown. Do you feel like eating? Let's not go downtown, huh, Eddie? Why not? Just because. What's the matter with you lately? You never wanna go downtown at night anymore. How much of that stuff do you want? You must have nearly two gallons already. That's enough. Hold it. Scram. Oh. Giddap, Napoleon. Hold it, you. She's headed for the barn! You think your mother will kick? I don't know. I haven't asked her yet. Oh, gee whiz. If we're gonna get married in three or four years... ...don't you think maybe you ought to kind of start hinting that we're engaged? You know, so it won't be so sudden-like? Uh-huh. I never saw such a woman. Always wanting to kiss, kiss, kiss. - I'm so cold. - Well, you'd better go in, then. Harriet, march yourself in this house right away, young lady. Darn it all. My mother will never let me have any fun. No, but she's helped me out a lot of times. Hey, why didn't you wanna go downtown tonight? I don't know. I guess I was afraid we might run into my mother. Your mother? What's the matter? Didn't she know you were going out with a girl tonight? Eddie, if I tell you something, will you promise me you won't tell anybody? I won't even open my mouth. For the past week, we've been getting our eats from the community chest. Honest? Oh, you egg. Why didn't you tell me things were that bad? Gee, I thought your mother got a job. She worked four days in the last five months. Whew. The tough part is she's got a little money coming in from a fellow we rent a room to. It'd be just about enough to barely keep her. But with me on her hands... You listen to me, Tommy. I'll talk to my dad. He'll help you and your mother. You watch and see. We don't want anybody to know we're up against it. Besides, I'm quitting school tomorrow. Gonna look for a job. Well, listen, you lug, will you wait till I talk to my father? Say, if he could only get me a job with the cement company... Why, you dumbbell, you couldn't lift a bag of cement. - You couldn't even lift a bag of feathers. - Who says so? - I say so. - You're full of dishwater. - Who? - You. - Why, you... - Can I lift a bag of cement or not? Hey, look out. Well, a miss is as good as a mile. Boy, you're telling me. Hey, you scared me. I thought everybody was in bed. What are you doing up so late, Dad? Oh, just checking over a few things. Say, Ma, you should have saw Grace tonight. "Seen Grace. " You been crying? Why, no. What would I be crying about? Say good night to Father and go to bed. Good night, Edward. - Good night. Say, Dad, could you do something for Tommy? Tommy who? Tommy Gordon. His dad's dead and, well, his mother hasn't worked in a long time. - And I thought maybe... - Just a minute, Edward. I may as well tell you now as later. You were right, your mother has been crying. Why? What's the matter? Tonight, I finished up at the cement company. I've been laid off indefinitely. Oh, gee, Dad. No fooling. You're old enough to realize the seriousness of it. It's not easy for a man of my age to step right into another position. So for a while, we'll all have to economize till I find something. Oh, I will. I'll cut down on everything. Gee, it's too bad Mom had to order me that new suit yesterday. No, I'm sorry, dear. I'm afraid we'll have to cancel that tomorrow. Oh, I don't know. I guess we can stand the suit. No, sir, nothing doing. I didn't like it, did I, Ma? Remember? I said I didn't want a gray one. Because it looked too much like my brown one. Remember? Yes, I remember you didn't like it. Come, get to bed. It's getting late. Good night, Dad. Good night, son. Good night, dear. - Hello, Dad. - Son. - No luck, huh? - Not very much. Saw Jenkins at the lumber company. He didn't give me very much encouragement. Oh, well. Don't you worry. You'll get something soon now. Go wash up. Luncheon's ready. Well, I'd say about $ 15. Oh, gee, Mr. Cadmust. Eddie paid $ 14 two months ago for those tires. Yes, and not counting that pbbt horn that you sold me yourself for 65 cents. Well, I don't know if she's worth 15. She may run, but there's no telling how long. Sounds to me like a cracked cylinder head or... Or a broken clutch plate. Maybe there's a rough bearing or two. As far as the body goes, why, she's all bent on the side... ...and the rear end is way out of line. Mr. Cadmust, what are you talking about? This is a sweet little bus. We've had her up to 46 and, boy, she hums like an airplane motor. Tommy and I tuned it up ourselves. Didn't we, Tommy? - Well, what do you want to sell her for? - Well, you see, it's... - Well, it's like this... - He has to, Mr. Cadmust. His father hasn't been... You see, my father's been kind of hinting that maybe he's gonna get me a new car. Well, this one would be in the way. We only got a single garage. I see. Well, I thought maybe if you'd give me $3o for her... Oh, shucks, I'll give you 2o. That's the best I can do. Oh, gee, Mr. Cadmust. Couldn't you make it 22? Well, I don't know. - Have you got your owner certificate? - Yes, sir. Right here, and it's all signed too. Mm. Well, all right. There's 1 o. And there's 15. And there's 2o. And 21, 22. Darn, I'll bet I get stuck on this. Gee, thanks, Mr. Cadmust. Can I drive it out in back for you by the used cars there? Never mind, Eddie. I'm figuring on junking her... ...and selling her piece by piece. That's the only way I can get my 22 back. - She was a sweet little bus, wasn't she? - Yeah. Makes a fellow feel kind of funny, like saying goodbye to somebody. Oh, come on. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. My nose is running. What did you think? Well, so long. Yell if you want me to go out with you tonight. You know I'm always with you. - Here, Dad. - Wha...? Where did this come from? Oh, I sold my car. I was tired of it anyway. You know me, have a thing a little while, get sort of fed up with it. I guess I'm just like my cousin Hugo. Hey, you're not sore at me, are you, Pop? No matter what you ever do, Edward... ...you'll never make me feel as proud of you as you have this minute. Heck, I didn't want it anyway. Ma was always afraid I'd get hurt in it anyhow. Come on, put up your dukes. Oh! That's the stuff. Hands down there. Sorry, Dad, I got a date with Tommy. You've been looking for a job for over two months now. What good would it do for me to look for one? Even my father can't get work. Maybe it would be better in some other place. Anyplace would be better than this dumb town. You know what we could do? I bet if we went to Chicago or New York, we could get jobs. That's just what I feel like doing. Would your father let you quit school and go? Oh, I wouldn't tell him. Why should I stick in school and have a good time... ...when he has to stand in a bread line? No, sir, boy. I'm pulling out tonight. And I'm right with you. Anyway, with me out of the way... ...Mom can get along with what she gets from the roomer. We won't say goodbye to the folks. We'll write them notes. Tell them we're leaving because we don't wanna be a burden. We'll say that when things get better, we can come back. How we going? We'll bum our way. I'll meet you in the freight yard in 15 minutes. Are you game? Sure. - Come on, let's go. - Wait. We can't get on while it's standing still. They'll see us. Come on. Something rip? I don't know, but I can sure feel a lot of cold air. Aah... Hey, you still asleep? Gee, I don't feel good. You'll feel better when we get something to eat. Look. When did he get on? I don't know. He probably got on during the night sometime. Hey, where do you suppose we are? In Nebraska. Kind of looks like Indiana to me. - Let's eat, huh? - Yeah, okay. Hey, where's the sandwiches? You wrapped them inside your shirt. They're not there now. Somebody hooked them. Bet I know who. Yeah? Then I'm gonna find out. Hey, you, wake up. What do you want? - Did you take something out of our bundles? No. - How'd you know we had bundles? I didn't know you had bundles. You're a liar. - Why, you... - Knock his block off. Come on, don't let him take you. He's a she. Sure, I'm a she. What did you think? And you find them on a flatcar. Gee, I'm awful sorry. I didn't know you were a girl. Go away and let me alone. - Did I hurt you? - You hurt me? Don't make me laugh. Boy, yours sure poked me a pip. I think you broke my nose. Look. Will you let me alone? Hey. Oh, are you dumb. I forgot. We put them in my bundle. Well, give me one. What are you gonna do, give it to her? Well, what if I am? Listen, I don't know what your name is, but I'm awfully sorry. We thought you took our sandwiches. We just found them. - Want one? - No. - What's the matter? Ain't you hungry? - Sure, I'm hungry. Well... - What's your name? - Sally. - Where you going? - Chicago. That's where we're going, to get work. - Where you from? - Seattle. Well, gee, ain't you afraid, traveling all alone? Wouldn't do me any good if I was. - Why, is somebody chasing you? - No. Pardon me. But I have to get to my aunt's in Chicago someway. And this is the only way I can do it. Well, don't your folks mind? My mother's dead. And we've got a big family. With me gone, it means just one less mouth to feed. That's why he was kind of glad to see me go. All I hope is my aunt will be glad to see me. She hasn't seen me since I was a little girl. She used to be nuts about me then. Oh, yeah, well, why didn't she send you your fare? Well, ain't it enough to ask her to support me for a while? Besides, I wanna surprise her. I like surprises. Don't you? Yeah, I like them. Look out! Duck! Get off. Go. Hey, Ollie, come on, hurry up. I ain't taking my feet out of this cow juice for any freight train. You sure is gonna have pretty feet. How come? Why, ain't you heard that milk's the greatest beautifier in the world? Anything you puts in it gets beautiful. Maybe I'm sticking the wrong end in. Come on, gang, let's go. Hey, kids, wait for me. Come on, get in line, boys. Pull them off. Come on, get off. Come on. Come on. Get out of there. Get up to that line up there. Hurry up, go on. Hurry up, come on. - Come on, you kids. - Come on, get in line here. Get in line. Form a straight line. Bullpen. Bullpen, fine. - Where you going? - Chicago, sir. - Got any relatives or friends here? - No, sir. - Come for a job, huh? - Yes, sir. You go over there to that bunch. Juvenile hall for you. Now, we haven't got enough jobs here for men, let alone kids. Pen for you. Pen. What's the matter with you? I'm sick in my stomach. What is this? Well, no wonder. You're eating stuff that ain't fit for a dog. Hospital for you, son. Got a drinking fountain there, by that bunch. Take him down there. Pen for you two. Pen. Pen for you two. Look, if you got a letter from somebody in Chicago, they let you stay. Gee, I haven't got a letter. I don't even know anybody in Chicago. So what? Listen, I got a letter I got from my father who lives here. To you, I'll sell it for a nickel. Well... A nickel, eh? A nickel, cash. Pen for you. Well, where are you bound to? To my father in Chicago. I've got a letter. - Phooey. - Pen for you. You too. Where are you going? I'm going to Chicago to see my mother. Oh. You're going to Chicago to see your mother. Yeah. How'd you guess it? Oh, nuts. Don't get so tough there, doctor. Take him away, Mac. Pen for you. Well, where are you going? My aunt, she lives here in Chicago. I've got a letter from her. Let's see it. - Don't say anything about your coming. - I know. I wanna surprise her. - You want to surprise her? - Mm-hm. Well, you'll surprise her all right. Run along, as long as you have an address to go to. - Mister. - Yeah? These are my two cousins. Oh. You three are gonna surprise your aunt, huh? Yes, sir. "Yes, sir. " All right, go ahead. Step on it. Wasn't he easy to fool? Gee, you were keen. You're coming to my aunt's. She's awfully nice. I know she'll be glad to have you. Don't be goofy. We couldn't really go to your aunt's. We don't even know her. Well, you can stay with her till you get a job, can't you? Gee, I'm shaking like a leaf. I wonder if my aunt will know me. If she doesn't at first, maybe she will after you wash your face. - What's the apartment number? - Two-sixteen. There it is. Gosh, I feel funny. I only hope she likes me. Yeah? Don't you remember me, Aunt Carrie? I'm Sally. Well, slap Aunt Carrie down. You've grown so, honey. I wouldn't know you in a million years. Where did you come from? From Seattle. And look. I picked up these boys on the road. And we're all gonna stay with you for a while. Aren't you glad? Am I glad? Your Aunt Carrie's so excited, she don't know what to say. Ha-ha. Come on inside. I'll fix you something. Come on. Not bad. Gee, isn't it swell? Look, a piano and everything. Gee, I'll say. It's keen. Now, you three march yourselves into the kitchen. You must be starved. Come on. There, you little darlings. Sit right down there. Aunt Carrie's gonna give you something that'll knock your eye out. Ha-ha. Boy. - Aren't you glad you came? - I wanted to come in the first place. - It was Tommy that was stalling. - What do you mean, me? There. Heh. Bless you, little darlings. Aunt Carrie's so glad you're not being bashful. Heh. Tell me, Sally, how's your father? And how'd you get here? Oh, Pop's all right, but he's having an awful time. That's why I came to visit you. And it didn't cost a cent. I rode all the way for nothing. All right, boys, I've got the evidence. Take them along. You can't get away with this. You can't pull me in. - What's the matter? - Looks like they're all getting pinched. They're all getting arrested. We don't wanna get mixed up in it. Wait till I see the judge. Out the window. Hey, Tommy, help. - Oh. - Whew. Gee, what happened? Gee, ain't you cold? Am I? I wish he'd hurry up with that fire. Don't you wish you were home in front of the radiator... ...with a nice big cup of hot tea? Stop. You're killing me. Get out of here, all of you. Come on, move on. Cheese it. Railroad dicks. Come on, Sally. Come on, Ollie. Hurry up. Let's go. Come on now. Come on, boys. Hurry up, doc. Hey. Aah. Come on, scram. - Get out of my way, I'm coming. You get out your own way. Hey, how far is the nearest town from here? Well, the nearest town is Columbus, 1 o miles down the track. That's a long ways to walk, bub, in this sun. Yeah, and how. Ain't there no towns between here and Columbus? No, just godforsaken country. What's the idea of building a fire? I didn't build it. - What's the matter? That sweater wet? - A little bit, but I don't mind. Come on back in the caboose. We'll dry it for you. This is all right. Thanks just the same. You don't wanna be friendly, huh? What did you let them put you off for? Let them? They threw us off. We couldn't help it. Those are railroad dicks. There's only seven or eight of them. There must be close to, what, a hundred of you here. What's the matter? Ain't you got no nerve? You mean we ought to fight them? Well, you got an army, ain't you? Hey, he's right. We got them outnumbered 2o-to-1. Hey, how many of you guys wanna fight? Come on! Come on, let's go! Hey, kids, if you know what's good for you, you'll keep off this train. Yeah? Who says so? Get away from that train and let us on... ...or somebody's gonna get hurt, see. Come on, guys. Come on, you big palooka. Come on, fellas. Come on. Let's go. There they are. Come on. Come on, fellas. Let them have it, boys. Let us go. - Boy. - Love and kisses. Come on, you big palooka. - Ooh. From the look of all that egg, that hen must have had a hard time laying it. And from the smell of it, she must have been a long time getting up. Hey. A kiss from Dixie! Sally, look. What's the matter? Did one of them hit you? That man, the brakeman. What did he do to you? While you were all outside fighting, he came in here. I was all alone. He put his hand over my mouth so I couldn't scream. Don't let him get away. - Turn him over to the police. - We can't. They'll nail us for busting in this car. - Why can't we take care of him ourselves? - That's a good idea. - Yeah. Wait, wait. - I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll get a... Hey, you kids. Which one of you broke in the reefers on this car? That's him. Don't let him... Come on, who did it? I did. Come on down and get me. You bet I'll come and get you. You dirty rat. Let him have it. Get him. Dirty rat. Boy, we're in for it now. Hey, fellows, we're coming into Columbus. Wait a minute, fellows. Listen. We gotta get out of here quick. They'll blame us for that guy getting killed. Hey, we're almost in the yards. There's a bunch of railroad dicks coming out to meet us. Come on, hurry up. Come on. Come on, let's get out of here. Hurry up, you guys, get out of here. Tommy! It's for a kid out near the railroad tracks. A train ran over his leg. A train, huh? What hospital did they take him to? He's not in any hospital. That's why we want you to come. Well, I don't know. I've had three major operations today and I'm pretty tired. But you've gotta come, doc. He needs somebody and he's in terrible pain. And his leg looks kind of funny. All right, son, I'll be right with you. Doc, you won't open your mouth to anybody, will you? - How is it, doc? - Pretty bad. As a matter of fact, it's too late to send him to a hospital. - Hospital? - Yeah. I've got to perform an operation, and right away. Gee, we didn't know it was that bad. Get over there by his head and keep talking to him. It makes a fellow feel different with a doctor around. Heh. Now you're talking, kid. Listen, Tommy. If you wanna bawl, it don't make any difference, see? Who's gonna bawl? Doc? - Yes, son? If I... If I cough... ...that means it's hurting too much. You see... ...I don't want the fellows to think I'm a baby. You won't feel anything, son. You just lay back and keep talking to your friend. You're not scared, are you, Tommy? No. What's there to be scared of? Nothing. Only I thought that... Take it easy, son. Only I thought that, well, you know, a fellow sometimes gets kind of nervous. Shucks, what do I care about an old leg? Just think, from now on... ...when I get a new pair of shoes, I'll only have to break in one of them. Sure. And won't I laugh at Harriet? I won't have to argue with her anymore about dancing. I won't even have to learn. That's right. Now roll him over. And another thing. I won't have to run errands for Mama... ...or bring up coal. I know you won't, Tommy. You'll get out of doing a lot of things. Sure, I'll get out of doing a lot of things. Like kicking footballs, playing basketball... ...going ice-skating, tumbling... ...walking. Mm-mm. Now there's a guy that can really sit. No fooling. All right, that won't hurt you now, kid. You know what I was thinking, Eddie? What? Maybe it would be better if we split up. What are you talking about? You know what I mean. I'm not much good. I can't catch freights. I can't do anything. All I can do is lay around here and eat and sleep. Well, why don't you give him a poke in the eye, Eddie? I can't go out with the guys to help get grub. Gee, you will. But you have to wait your turn. Ah. That's what you always say. You always say wait until my turn. But you're not kidding me. You think the crutch hurts my arm and makes me tired. Look, Tommy, it isn't always gonna be like this. With those artificial legs they have nowadays... What's the use of fooling me? We're not fooling. You wait and see. When I get a job, that's the first thing you're gonna have. And they don't cost as much as you think. And, boy, can they fit them. A kid told me this morning that his uncle wore one for 3o years. And he used to forget to take it off at night. Heh. - On the level? - Cross my heart. What's the kid's name? Uh... Uh... I can't think of his name right now. But I'll find him and you can ask him yourself. Hey, Eddie, the panhandling gang is waiting for you. Come on. Snap out of it, kid. Hey, wait a minute. I want you to see how the crutch works with the pad. See? You notice it doesn't throw my shoulder out like it used to? - Yeah. - And look how fast I can go. Gee, that's swell. Hey, Eddie, come on. See you later. What's the matter? Is he having trouble with his crutch again? Oh, shut up. Don't. He don't like anybody to pick him up. Let's go, gang. Hey, where we going? Where are we going, Eddie? Hey, there's a good spot over there. Okay, gang. We'll take this side and, Mac, you and your bunch take the other. Okay, gang, let's go. Say, mister, could you give a fellow a nickel or dime... ...to get a cup of coffee or a loaf of bread? I ain't had nothing to eat since... I'm sick of this panhandling. I'll show you where you can get something to eat. Hey, Mike. Mike. Hey, stop him. Stop him, somebody. Hey, stop him. Stop him. Stop him, somebody. Stop him. Can't you give a hop with the other foot when you put this one down? What do you think I am, a rabbit? I'm telling you, I can't stand on it. It rubs the bone. And it ain't the right leg. It was the best I could do. Come on, try again. Come on, Tommy. Attaboy. Now you're doing swell. Keep going, keep going. Come on, Tommy. Take it easy, man. Gee, you're doing swell. Come on, Tommy. Come on. Aw... I told you, it doesn't fit. I can never use it. What's the use of trying? Forget it. I should've known a guy has to be measured for one. Let me take it off. Don't think I don't appreciate it, Eddie. I know you got it just to help me, but honest... Skip it, will you, Tommy? Hey, Eddie, look, they're gonna put us out of here. What? Put who out? "Police say Sewer Pipe City must go. Trace looting of Acme Surgical Supply House direct to young hoodlums. Boys given until noon to leave the city. " - How'd they find out? - They knew we had a kid with one leg. - Well, we ain't gonna move, are we? No! They can't put us out. We've got permission. They'll run us off streets, keep us out of freight yards. - We'll stay right here. - Let them try and put us out. The first cop that comes in here, we'll mob him. We'll fight. We'll show them. We've got 35 minutes. - Go get your ammunition ready. - Come on! - Take it easy, Tommy. - Okay. Look out, gang. Here they come. Well, let's get together. Take it easy, you fellows. Remember your orders. No clubs, and don't roughhouse any of them. Boy, there's a lot of them. All right, boys. Just move on quietly and don't create any disturbance... ...and nobody's going to get hurt. We're not picking any of you up. We're giving you a chance to get out of town. We're not hurting anybody. We got permission to live here. You can ask the guy that owns the yard. Don't tell me what to do. You heard the orders. Start moving, all of you. - Get going. Come on, cop. This one's for you. This is a rotten trick, if you ask me. How do you think I feel with two kids of my own at home? Try and keep it low, Bill. Hit them on the legs. Aah! I'll give you another one. We can't beat them. You duck down to the freight yard. - We'll try and hold them off. - Okay, come on, kids. What's the matter? Nothing. Do you feel sick? I feel all right. Tommy, why'd we ever come to New York? I don't know. I hate the place. I wish we'd stayed in the country. At least we slept in barns... ...and didn't have to stand in line to get something to eat. Will you ask Eddie just once more? What's the use? He won't hit the road again. He thinks New York's a swell place. Heh. Look at it. Tommy, Sally. - What is it? - I got it! I was walking down Church Street by those salesroom buildings. I see a line of kids and there's a sign up there says "boy wanted. " There was an old guy walking up and down, so I got in line and he picked me. You got a job? Start tomorrow morning, $ 12 a week. Holy cat. Eddie. What did I tell you? Didn't I always say New York was the spot for us? Listen, I've been thinking it over on the way home. We can move into a nice boarding house. We'll get two rooms. I can stake Tommy to selling papers. You'll get a job washing dishes or something. Heck, that reminds me. What's an alpaca coat? Why? Do you have to have one? I think it's like mohair. You know, the stuff they cover chairs with. The guy said I had to have one of them and a pair of blue pants. I'm gonna run an elevator. Gee, what are you gonna do? I bet I could pick the whole shooting match up for about $3. Three dollars? Have we got that much? No, but we can get it. You know how. - Panhandling. - Right, and that's just what I'm gonna do. We'll help you. I'll bet with this peg leg of mine and my harmonica, I could raise $3 in no time. You mean with your harmonica and my: Say, lady, could...? Mister, could you give a fellow a nickel to...? Say, mister, could you give a fellow a nickel to help him buy himself a coat? Go on, beat it. I'm on the stem myself. Say, lady, could you give a fellow a nickel to help buy himself some clothes? Sure, I think so. Gee, thanks, lady. - Say, miss... - Hey, kid, come here. Listen, how would you like to make 5 bucks? Five dollars? Look, do you see that moving-picture theater across the street? Yeah. What about it? Give this note to the dame in the box office. She'll give you a package. Bring it back here to me and I'll slip you the 5 bucks. Five dollars for doing that? Why can't you take it over? Well, listen, that dame is my wife. She's sore at me and my brother, see? And when we try to talk to her, she starts up a fight. You get the idea? Yeah, all right, give it to me. Tommy, Tommy. What did I tell you? Didn't I say I'd get it? Didn't I say New York was a swell town for opportunities? Five bucks for just taking this across the street. The lucky stiff. Gee. You're too late. The feature's started. A guy across the street asked me to give you this. Help! Help, police! Help! Stickup! Help! You charge 25 cents for aspirin. When you buy for 100 stores, you get it for less, so you sell it for 18 cents. So your house, I mean, your store is crowded. That's great, Chester, old boy. That's a marvelous idea. Don't you get the connection? We'll use it, if we ever open a drugstore. No, listen. When you put out one prologue, it's too expensive. But when the same prologue plays 25, 50, 100 houses, it's doesn't cost more. We might have something there. Get him out of here. The same scenery, same costumes. Put them on once and they stay put on. But we've only got four theaters. - Eddie, what's the matter? - I don't know. Mister, he didn't do anything. We're with him. We were watching him. Yeah? Well, then maybe you better come along too. Come on, all of you. Hurry up. Come on, get in that car. Hurry up. Go on, get in there. Hurry up, get in there. Vagrancy, petty theft, resisting police... ...breaking and entering and holdup. Not a very pretty record, is it? According to the record here, you refuse to tell where you live. Is that right? Yes, sir. You also refuse to help us locate your parents. Is that correct, Edward? Yes, sir, it is. Why? Well, I'll tell you why. Because our folks have got enough worry without us bringing them more. But don't you realize all of you are making a bad matter worse? If you have no address or no one to be responsible for you... ...the law won't let me be lenient. Why don't you youngsters come clean? Tell me the whole story. Let me be your friend. I want to help you. Sure. Will you, Tommy? Sally, won't you tell me who your father and mother are? Where they live? Eddie, you're in the worst spot of all. Your record and your age will compel me to sent you to a reformatory. You're an enemy to society and I've got to keep you off the street. Now have you anything to say? Sure, I got something to say. I knew all that stuff about you helping us was baloney. I'll tell you why we can't go home. Because our folks our poor. They can't get jobs and there isn't enough to eat. What good will it do you to send us home to starve? You say you gotta send us to jail to keep us off the streets. Well, that's a lie. You're sending us to jail because you don't wanna see us. You wanna forget us. Well, you can't do it. Because I'm not the only one. There's thousands just like me. And there's more hitting the road every day. You read in the papers about giving people help. The banks get it. The soldiers get it. The breweries get it. And they're always yelling about giving it to the farmers. What about us? We're kids. Gee, I'm not a bad boy. Neither is Tommy. Us three kids have been traveling around the country looking for work. You don't think we like the road, do you? I had a job this morning. All I needed was an alpaca coat. I had to have it, do you hear? I had to have it. We were broke and I went out to beg for a few nickels. When a guy gave me a chance to make $5, sure, I took it. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't anybody? Gosh, how did I know what a mess it was gonna get us into? Oh, I only did it for the coat. I only did it for the job. I only did it because I wanted to work. It meant everything to us. But what's the use? You're not gonna believe me and I don't care whether you do or not. Go ahead, put me in a cell, lock me up. I'm sick of being hungry and cold, sick of freight trains. Jail can't be any worse than the street, so give it to me. Eddie, I'm going to dismiss your case. You're gonna what? Furthermore, I'm going to help you. I'll phone the personnel manager of the place that gave you that job... ...and see that you go to work. Gee, judge. I'm going to do my part. And now I want you to do yours. I knew there'd be a catch in it someplace. No, Eddie, no catch. It's simply that things are going to be better now. Not only here in New York, but all over the country. I know your father will return to work shortly. That means you can go back to school. I want you to promise me that when you've made enough money... ...you'll buy a ticket and go back home, where you belong. Will you do that? Sure, judge. But... Don't worry about them. Sally, I know I can place you in some private home... ...where you can do a little housework for a while. Tommy, we'll have more of a problem with you, son. But I'll make you one promise. We'll find a spot for you and you'll be given a chance. Thank you. And you'll all go home together. But this time, you'll earn your way. That's all. Go over to the juvenile hall and they will give you your release papers. Everything else will be taken care of. Gee, that's really good. Come on, Eddie. - Gee, isn't he a marvelous guy? - I'll bet he likes kids. - I'm beginning to think Eddie was right. - How? New York's a marvelous place. - Oh, Eddie's always right. - Go on. Gee, aren't you happy, Eddie? - Wanna see how much? - Mm-hm. That much. Come on, pal. Okay.
