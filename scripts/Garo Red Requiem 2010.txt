To feast on man's soul and gnaw on his flesh. As long as there is malice in the world, Horrors will appear through the Portals. But there are those who have sacrificed themselves to fight the Horrors. Slicing the darkness with the light of hope Their fight will never end. And tonight... Karma is sure to like this place. Yeah. There's lots to eat here. Original Story and Directed by KEITA AMEMIYA Didn't you say you've been here before? Forget it. It was long ago. You're as cold as ever. There's something here. Do you feel it? I can feel a big hassle brewing. Excuse me... Help me! Who would help you? Huh? Here we go - Shiguto! - Got it. Do as I say! OK! Rekka You're back. Ill brush this Horror away. You ruined my brand new body. Shiguto When did you get back, Rekka? I just arrived. And you're already exterminating Horrors? Awesome. Oh, the baby... You been OK? Yeah. Ill take that baby if you don't mind. Too much for you guys to handle. - Akaza, get rid of that baby! - What? Shit! Its a Tower Horror Bevil. It feasts on other horrors! Be careful, Kouga. Got it. Kouga, his armor is too hard. Get off! - What do you think, Kouga? - Ive seen enough. Stand back. Wait, Master Kouga Saejima. Im a Makai Priest, so I know who you are. You're the one who holds the title of Garo. I protect this area. My name is Akaza. This is my disciple Shiguto. She's Rekka. I followed a Horror to this town. A wicked Horror that lives in a mirror and feeds on humans who peer into it. It talks. The Demonic Horror Karma... Karma? Like the one we just vanquished, an apostle of evil. That's who we're after. I don't care about any other Horrors. I will vanquish Karma. I received my orders from the Watchdog Command. This is a job for a Makai Knight. Then I'll just find it first and beat you to it. Rekka, wait. We haven't seen you for so long... Forgive her, Master Kouga. Have you noticed anything unusual lately? Unusual? Nothing. Its been very quiet. Are you all alone? Yeah. So? That guy over there... Wants to talk to you. This is no ordinary mirror. If you look into it, you'll see whatever you most desire. Really? Looks like you want fame and adoration. Go ahead. Touch it. Touch what you desire. Who are you? Where am I? What's wrong, Kouga? I felt something strange. There's no sign of any Horrors. They're in this town. Im sure of it. Look. Karma seems so satisfied. Flesh that goes from hope to despair is so nice and tender... Its delicious. Zaruba, don't you feel anything? No. Its almost daybreak. Let's call it a night. That's a very touching song, Princess. Oh, it's you, Kouga Saejima. What's the name of your enchanted ring? Zaruba. Now listen to me, Zaruba. If you ever call me ''princess'' again, Ill shut your mouth. OK, Sorry. Your name's Rekka, right? That's right. Rekka, why are you chasing Karma? - Why? -Yes. Simple. Its a Horror. That's why I became a Makai Priestess. Its up to the Makei Knights to defeat the Horrors. Its not your place. You make the rules that suit yourselves. The Makai Priests were the first to battle the Horrors. The Priests weren't strong enough, which is why the Knights were needed. Zip it, Zaruba. Sorry. This princess is just so snotty. I warned you. The only reason I couldn't become a Knight is because Im a woman. Priest, Knight, who cares? Im strong enough to vanquish Horrors! And Im strong enough to vanquish Karma. Please. Take me with you. You're not ready to use the Makai Sword. But, I won't lose to anyone. I want to vanquish Horrors! I want to be like my father. This is how strong you are. You're not strong enough to vanquish a Horror yet. That little girl really did it. I couldn't open my mouth. Careful, Zaruba. She's young, but she's got skills. Don't blame me if she did it again. Don't be ridiculous. Can't you sell this for half price? I can't do that. I won't make any money. - Come on. Give me a discount. - I buy stuff here all the time. Give it a rest. And quit giving me a hard time. Cheapskate. Welcome. Shion, a Makai Knight has come to town. A Makai Knight? Karma has sent countless Makai Knights to their grave. Im not worried. But he's a Golden Knight. He's a formidable opponent. A Golden Knight? Has he appeared in this town? It seems so. Even if sacrificing our own lives, we will protect you. I don't need protection. No one dare point their swords to me. As you can see, if there were Horrors nearby, we would know of it. Is Karma really that terrible? Yes, Karma does not possess humans. Its the Horror that only possesses mirrors. Its hard to defeat because it jumps from mirror to mirror. Whatever mirror it's in becomes cursed. The only way to fight it is to enter the mirror. That's right. Just how are we supposed to enter a cursed mirror? According to this book... It says ''Part with your life in front of the cursed mirror. '' So basically you have to die. You can't enter without dying? Then Karma can't be vanquished! There's only one way to enter without dying. The Magic Sword of Luvis. If you use that sword, the mirror will open. Akaza, the last one should be here somewhere. Its here? Is that true? Yes. Magically wrought iron. This was made by Horrors, so it will open the portal to their world. So many Maki Knights and Makai Priests... used this device to enter the mirror. But not one of them ever returned. Why? It doesn't give the power to return to our world. If Karma is defeated, the mirror will shatter. There's only one way back. Vanquish Karma. Ill do it. That's why I came back. Don't touch it! Ill find out where Karma's hiding. Keep this safe until then. Understood. I won't give it to anyone. But no one has ever beaten Karma... Don't worry, Shiguto. There's a reason he's a Golden Knight. You said it, Mr. Zaruba. Shiguto. Don't call it Mister! Im borrowing the key to your dojo. Incredible. Im impressed. You fight beautifully. But you don't keep your guard up. I don't need to keep my guard up. As long as I get the job done. Out it out. I don't want to hurt you. If I was your enemy, he'd be dead. That's not fair, Kouga! Would you say that to the Horror? What? Rekka, no! Get off! This is how strong you are. Forgive my insolence. No, no. It is Rekka who has been insolent. That dress would look great on you. I know a place where you would look fantastic in that dress. Want to go? Kouga, I can sense a Horror nearby. She got away. She's a fast one. The flesh of lustful women... looks so delicious... Who's this? Woman, what do you desire? What is this, magic? Look into the mirror. Your desire will appear. Seriously? A disturbance... Something does seem a bit off, Kouga, but maybe it's nothing. I don't sense any Horrors. I feel it. There are Horrors here. Why don't I feel anything? What was that? Now this place reeks of Horrors. Here's your answer. An invisible force field? Surprising. This is how the Horrors kept their evil from being detected. There's a traitor in our midst. Only a Makai Priest could do this. Hikari... Akaza, there are Horrors down by the pier! Its never been this strong before. Rekka... keep cool. Same to you. Wanna get a drink? You've got a good vibe. Wanna get out of here? Kouga, can't we have a little fun? Pipe down. This isn't my kind of place. Looking for someone? There's someone here who wants to meet you. This way. Im starting to get a headache. This mirror will show you what you want to see. What I want to see... Look into your heart. Too bad. I don't have any evil thoughts. No evil thoughts? Are you sure? Rekka. Father. So you're this Makai Knight's daughter? Karma. You're as courageous as he was. Rekka. Father! Pain... Rekka... Help me! Father... Rekka! Rekka! Look away! Let go! Get out! Go! Karma! Get off! Rekka, no! They're humans, not Horrors. When they're under the spell they're just like Horrors. Enough. Stop! You get out too. What? Im taking down Karma! As if you could nail me like that. Stop! Your armor is in the mirror! What happened? Kurusu, start by devouring the girl. Rekka! Kouga! Rekka. Back off! Who betrayed us? What are you talking about? Who made the force field? Who helped that beast Karma? Forgive me. Why, Akaza? How dare you. - Leave him alone! - Let me go! Karma murdered my father. Akaza befriended the enemy! Rekka. Master Kouga... Why do you want to vanquish the Horrors? Because they're evil. That's not enough. Why do Makai Knights risk their lives fighting Horrors? And why I shouldnt take you along and go into battle? Once you become a full-fledged Makai Knight, you'll understand. Don't be hasty, little one. Your time is still a long ways off. Boy. Return to this place after you've become a strong Knight. I have a daughter. She's loud and obnoxious. But she says when she grows up, she's going to be a Makai Knight. But girls can't... Right. Girls can't become Makai Knights. However... every time she says it... it makes me happy. A song to comfort the spirits of the war dead. My daughter likes this song. That's soothing. But Im not dead yet. You know this song? Its a lullaby for the departed. I know. I heard it as a boy. Kouga. Im as bad as Akaza. I didn't try to protect anyone. Its my fault your armor was stolen. I lost myself. I... I hate what Ive become. Im glad I protected you. Your armor was stolen! Im... Im not worth protecting. Don't get it wrong. I didn't just save your life. Beyond every individual life... there are family and friends and loved ones. I fight to protect all those lives. Rekka... you're strong. With your strength, you will be able to protect many others. lf you perish, many more lives will be lost. So, Rekka... it wasn't just your life I was protecting. Kouga, I... Don't be hasty. Your time will come. She will be a strong one. Zaruba, my armor was stolen. Yeah. That's not good. What will you do, Kouga? Can I even call myself a Knight without my armor? Well, that's for you to decide. Im just an enchanted ring. I haven't been taught how to console humans. But Kouga, I think you know the ancient word for hope in the Makai World. ''Garo. '' That's the name I inherited. Look. They are the victims of Karma, left in misery. And before long... He will follow in their footsteps. Leave it alone. We can use it to lure him here. As you wish. Ill put a shield around the building. Its beautiful. Through this mirror... I could see my departed wife and daughter. I knew they were just illusions. And yet... I could see them laughing again. Before I knew it, I couldn't stop. I fell right into Karma's trap. I have informed the Watchdog Command. Im ready to pay for what Ive done. I had hoped we could have a drink together some day. Dying won't make amends. You don't have the strength. The Magic Sword of Luvis. I kept it hidden so one day I could use it against Karma. But now I don't have the courage to go through with it. It isn't courageous merely to accept certain death. Master Kouga, let me go to my death. Your death will just make Rekka feel worse. If you really want to make up... Pass on all you've got to your disciples before you meet your end. It seems to be somewhere around here. Shiguto, you have to be exact. Cant you locate it properly? Ill try again. He knows where they are. You're right. I got it. They're in the deserted house on the pier. How far is it from here? Its not far. Ill show you the way. Rekka. Don't worry. Ill behave. I just want to help you. I know Id feel better if Rekka were with us. Kouga, do you have a plan? The Magic Sword of Luvis. I borrowed it from Akaza. If I enter the mirror, I can get my armor back. Hold on. What are you saying? We're not strong enough. Let's wait for help from the Watchdog Command. Don't worry. I will return. Shiguto, you stay here. Master Kouga. Im not as strong as you or Rekka, but... But, I... Can you use the notes from the nether world? Of course I can. Shiguto, if you're going to turn back, do it now. Who said anything about turning back? Shiguto, don't do anything rash. Same to you, Rekka. Akaza... Master Kouga. This should be enough to take care of any minor Horrors. I brought everything I could find. Wow. This is incredible! Please let me accompany you. Ill never forgive you, Akaza. But it's your call, Kouga. I won't argue with whatever you decide. Priest... Please join us. Thank you very much. Let's go. What's with all these evil spirits? Kouga, it won't be easy finding Karma. We'll find her faster if we split up. Master Kouga and Rekka, you go ahead. Shiguto and I will follow after we've sealed the entrance. Shiguto, don't let any of these evil spirits get out. Understood. Ill send a signal if I find Karma. Let's go. Akaza! What was that? Manifestations of the suffering caused by being devoured by Karma. Manifestations? So Karma uses the misery of those she devours to fight her enemies. Unforgivable. Let's go, Akaza. Even after Karma graciously spared your life... What a fool. It is you who are foolish. Kouga! Rekka's giving the signal! Akaza. Shion... Ive painted so many pictures of you. But it's no use. You... You're not Shion! What's your problem? Constantly muttering ''Shion''. Creeps me out. She's dead, isn't she? You're wrong! Shion... isn't dead! What is your desire? If there's something you desire, just touch it and see what happens. Shion... Ive been waiting for you, Makai Priestess. You came back to hear more of yourfatherbegging for mercy? Karma! Im here to destroy you. And how do you plan to do that? Care to join me in this world? Kouga. You took my precious Shion! Shiguto, guard the entrance. We have to protect them. Got it. So this is your true human form? I was meant to live forever with Shion. Any idea how many lives you spared so the two of you could live? Spared? No. They were feasted on. Their deaths weren't in vain. How dare you! Stand back. Ill handle this. You'll never understand. The sadness of losing a loved one. Karma returned to me my beloved Shion and we became Horrors. We received new life. Then you took it away from us. You killed my beloved Shion! Its you who don't understand. What? You turned the one you love into a Horror. Your eternal life was just a deception. Shut up! Garo! Goten! The spirits of the fallen heroes... Akaza. Rekka, play your flute. Summon the fallen heroes to help you battle Karma. Golden Knight, why do you persist? Hunting Horrors is my destiny. Be my servant. I will grant you eternal life, just as l did to the two before you. What eternal life? There is no future in this world. Garo! Father? Rekka... Father! Rekka. Master Kouga. You're safe. Kouga, did you defeat Karma? Yes. Thanks to you. It wasn't me. The one who saved you was... Thank you, Akaza. Akaza! Akaza! Akaza, don't give up! Wake up! Cut it out! I haven't forgiven you yet. Wake up! Wake up, and apologize to me! That's enough! Rekka, that's enough! No! I haven't forgiven you yet. You can't die before I forgive you! Enough. Akaza's dead. He died to save us. No. He didn't just save us. Isnt that right, Kouga? Isnt that right? Yes. He saved the future of millions. Now it's up to us to protect the future. This is the end of our tale. But the hunt for Horrors will never end. Knights will continue to fight for as long as they draw breath. They live to protect. That is their fate. Are you staying here, Rekka? Ah, I won't say anything if you want to go. Im staying. Shiguto can't protect this town all by himself. A wise decision. What's that supposed to mean? Akaza would be pleased. You're right. Shiguto. Rekka. Thank you. Thanks, Master Kouga. You're just going to let him go? Kouga... Don't forget about me. Whenever youre in trouble, Ill be there for you. Take it with you. Ill call for you when I need a Makai Knight. I understand. Its a promise. I never thought Id actually get to meet a Golden Knight. He's the light of all our hopes. Go forth like the wind, swordsman of destiny... Shrouded in the darkness What does he fight for? Simply ask his sword... Justice and love aren't for him Born to darkness, cloaked within the darkness... Outing through the darkness Because this duty was bestowed from an ancient, distant time... Go forth like the wind, Swordsman of the Makai On a moonlit night, give forth your golden radiance The grand figure of a solitary warrior... Place your soul into it As you wield your furious blade and carve out your history, Garo! Crushed by a dream, having lost it and now idolizing it Hoping for a bright new day that cannot be seen yet Give rise to it Rise up in your vengeance, Swordsman of the Makai The song of your fate demands that you do so Shine in the moonlight, solitary warrior Against the encroaching shadows... Deliver consummate destruction with your proud roar, Garo Go forth like the wind, soldier of fate Bring light to the darkness... Fubuki, Geiru, Akane... What are you babbling about? I 'm trying to come up with a good name for her. Kaoru... What about Kaoru? Give it a rest. GARO
