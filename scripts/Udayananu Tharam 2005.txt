The Lumiere brothers made films a reality. You look arrogant. You should be gentle while talking to audience. OK. - OK Sir. This is a film related to films. Lumere brothers.. - Cut it! Listen! Don't try to be a joker. Don't be too gentle. You try to be specific, that's all. - Yes Sir. This is a film related to films. The Lumere brothers made films a reality. Thereafter, many great film makers came.. ...and gave new definition to films. There was laughter inside the cinema theaters. The audience could feel the emotions of the characters.. ...of the silver screen like in their personal life. The films soothed human life under trying conditions. Madras became the centre of the south Indian films. Thousands of people came to Madras to try their luck in films. They were many who made it big & many who were ruined in this film city. We know only those made it big. And nobody knows about the one who couldn't succeed. The hero of this story, Udhaybhanu had come to Madras 12 years ago. He was an assistant director. And was trying to become an independent director. Cinema was not just his ambition, but it is his life too. The screenplay of the first film is in progress. 'Om Satyajit Ray Namaha.' 'Om Spiel Berg-aya Namaha.' 'Priyadarshanaya Namah.' 'Kurasova, Aravinda, Chaplin-aya Namaha.' Oh God! Give me a great climax to this story! Anusha and Ravi met on the platform unexpectedly. But to shoot on the railway platform. ...a deposit of Rs. 5 lakhs is required. And if producer is not ready for that, then.. I'll make the film for the one who is ready do that. Anyway, the dialogues of Anusha should be brilliant. Look Ravi.. I don't want to invite you.. Ravi in my life, which is cloudy. Shit.. Stupid dialogues! Would anyone talk like this in real life? Cloudy.. Nonsense! The matter should be simple. There is no need of 'Look Ravi.' It feels like a serial. You've come to see the one who is running away, isn't it? You're standing here just because you've a platform ticket & you can't go beyond. The one who watches us will think we are very close. But it's only we know how far we are with each other. Good! That's good! Let us pray so that Udhaybhanu gets a good climax. This city is full of cinemas. We are on our way to a film studio. The heroine of this story, Madhumati is in the studio. She was awarded the best actress of the university. It was Udhaybhanu who introduced Madhumati to his mentor. The very first film itself was a very big hit. And Madhumati is a big star today. Though Madhumati is indebted to Udhaybhanu.. ...and she likes him, but there is nothing like love between them. But Udhaybhanu is restless about the unwanted gossips. This is Rajappan Thengamulli, sorry these are his legs. He has been looking for a good role in Malayalam cinema for a long time now. Is it because of his looks that is not getting a good role? Or is it because of his color and figure? He has done many small bit roles. But he is still waiting for his dream role. He has a darker complexion than me. And he isn't so handsome, yet he is a superstar. Gad! The one's wearing suits go to Wing A. - Yes sir. It's a Telugu movie, a company meeting scene. The rest are all for Shivaji's garden. A Tamil film. You will get your dress, guns everything there. - Yes sir. And if you have any doubts, then call me. OK sir. Come on people. Go on in this auto. Sir! Do you have any role? - There are many. What, will you come? - Is there any dialogue in the role? No, it's a landlord's film. An India Pakistan war scene. You will get the uniform, and guns there. You will get lunch and snack in the evening too. And 100 rupees. So will you come? If there isn't a dialogue. Hey when everyone is shooting who will think about dialogues. - That's right. Rajappan, earlier the house owner had come. - Is it? It was nice that you left early. He shouted a lot. He would have beaten you if you were here. Then. - Then nothing. Thomas has kicked Thadimadi out of the house because he didn't pay the rent. He deserves it. Last week, he didn't give me a loan of Rs. 50.. You have been kicked out too! - But I was not there. He broke your lock and he locked it with a new one. Your suitcase and other items have been thrown out. - Is it? I took it and kept it at my doorsteps. You should have kept it inside your house. I decided not to do that after thinking a lot. You will come in along with the suitcase. That is risk. And it's just because two scoundrels have come from native place. And there is no breathing space. Why don't you try Udhay's place? No chance, he is writing the story. And while writing story, he'll behave like a dog who gave birth to the new born. He'll cut me into pieces. Rajappan, then go and try at some other place. Why don't you work as a junior artist at least for a couple of times like me? At least you can earn enough for your rent! Dear Rafiq, I am not like you. I have an aim. And I'll do anything to reach there. Once you become a junior artist.. ...you'll be a junior artist till your death, understand. I got the climax! Brother Bhaskaran, sister Sharada, I got the climax! A fantastic climax! Krishnaswamy, I got the climax! I've got a great climax! What's the matter? Brother Bhaskaran. - Yes. I got the climax! Such a climax that nobody expects! The climax that Malayalam cinema has never seen. I was working for the last ten days to get a good climax! I got the climax, a real thriller! A stunning twist! A nail biting finish! Udhayan, what is the climax? Ravi is coming back to the place from where he ran away, isn't it? - Yes. As Ravi got of the train and came out of the station.. ...no, no, I'll not tell the climax. Brother Bhaskaran will lose the thrill while watching it. I have to make some corrections in the screenplay. I'll see you later. I will see you later. I've got the climax! I've got the climax! He is a bit normal today after 3-4 months. He was screaming and shouting all these days in the room.. He used to come out.. ...stare at the sky and shout something. Then run in again. It was as if he was going to hang himself. Is writing a screenplay that tough a job? I haven't tried it yet. - Then you should try it. Will you get a chance in Udhayan's film? No, I don't have that star value. If you know that why are you wandering here in Madras? You are here for a long time now. Why don't you go to your native place & stay with your wife and children? You are staying here with your wife and children for a long time now... Why don't you go for pilgrimage and give them peace of mind? It's because of this you are not prospering. You've prospered too much. You're staying in a single room with your wife and three children. And in the same room you are cooking. And he thinks he's Tata. Single room Tata Bhaskaran! As I was obsessed with the screenplay.. "Rajappan, I didn't see you. And what's this like Bangladeshis with a suitcase and all? I won't tell lie. I've been kicked out of the house as I didn't pay the rent. I am lucky that you've finished writing the story. It's my luck that I've finished writing the story. Are you planning to stay with me? - No.. - Then? Udhayan, shouldn't I find some place to keep this suitcase and the mat? Don't play that game. If I help you, it's sure you'll take advantage of it. Did you think I would forget what you did last time? When you were thrown out of the house six months ago.. ...I gave you the shelter. Then what did you do? When you went for out door shooting.. ...I allowed two guys to stay here and took rent from them. Who gave you the right to give my room on rent? Then should I've allowed them to stay freely? Who asked you to make them stay here? That's my mistake, I agree and will not repeat it! - Fine. I'll tolerate you once more. But I want to know one thing. When will you vacate? Udhayan, for shifting to a new place.. ...at least there should be Rs.5000 to give advance. But it's just a matter of getting a good role in cinema. Which cinema? And who is going to give you a good role? I've spoken to many people to give a chance. But that you are doing it for a long time now. Rajappan, tell me something which is practical. I don't think you'll ever get a good role. - Udhayan! Then what? You must have got award for the best actor.. ...In schools for doing the roles of leprosy and TB patient. That is not enough for doing films. Acting is what reacting it is behaving. Do you know what Stansoloski said about acting? Please! What has that good to do now? Rajappan, why are you still expecting a good role then? Mr. Udhayan! Mr. Udhayan, Madhumati Amma is missing. Whose mother? - Not mother, but Madhumati. Sir, don't you know me? I am Vijayan Varkala, production manager. I am coming from the sets of KP Nanappan. I've something important to tell you. Sir, if you could come this side.. What's it? - Mr. Nanappan was shooting for a song. The song was shot on Madhumati. It was a very good song. Suddenly Madhumati said that she is leaving. She threw the wig and left the shooting in a car. Now the whole unit is stand still. What should we do now? What you should do why I should tell? I just asked you. - Then I'll tell you one thing. It's all her wish whether to come or go. If Mr. Nanappan thinks that she'll come back to the set if ...I call then he is wrong. Now Mr. Vijayan Varkala can go. If the shoot is canceled today, it isn't possible to release the film on Christmas. Christmas will come next year too. - Sir, don't say like that. The producer was not having the money at all. And so he pawned his wife's jewellery to do the payments. That's not a problem. That's his own wife. - Sir.. It's men like you who gossiped in the industry that.. ...there is something between Madhumati and me. The magazines too wrote about that. And may be to confirm that Mr. Nanappan had sent you here. Oh no! Nanappan is a very good man. Do you know what Mr.Nanappan has told? That Mr. Udhayan knows the value of producer's tears. It's because of your recommendation Madhumati acted in her first film. And this reason is enough for Madhumati to obey you. Mr. Nanappan is not aware of the heroines and the gossips you're talking about. It's when you said now, even I came to know about it. Where is Madhumati now? - I don't have any idea. But the cell phone is ringing. And she'll not attend our calls. But Sir, she'll surely attend your call. All right, I'll see. You go and call me after sometime. - OK. How did you come? I came in brother Bhaskaran's vehicle. Whatever the reason is, leaving the set in between is not right. You should have thought of the loss to the producer... ...and to the colleagues. Do you think that the media will keep quiet? Each second is very precious so don't waste the time, get back. Just a minute, at least listen to.. Madhu, don't you know that shooting is interrupted, people are waiting for you? Mr. Udhayan, that means you're not bothered about my feelings. Had this director ever made a film that hasn't questioned human commonsense? Why are you asking that now? Mr. Udhayan, I've told you the attitude of my father and brother. They are just blindly taking advances from wherever they could. Like the animals which are brought on rent. They neither want to know about the story.. ...nor they want to know who the director is. You should have told you'd act only if you like the story. I said that hundred times. But who is listening to me? That the director has talked to my brother about the story. He said it was fantastic. And such a story has never come before. I heard the story when I went for shooting yesterday. It was just horrible. I even shot for a role where people teased me. I couldn't sleep yesterday night.. ...as I couldn't take any decision. Do you know how many times I tried Mr. Udhayan's cell? You didn't attend the call after seeing my number. You called yesterday? Yes, yes, I forgot.. to take the cell when I went out. Didn't you check the missed calls after coming back? Perhaps I didn't notice. You still don't know how to lie so that others can believe you. Don't say that. Sometimes I don't attend your calls purposely. There may be someone in the room. Why should we give them a chance to make stories? But if I want to ask you or tell you something.. That's not the way people look at things. Madhu, now you are a well-known star. It's better for an assistant director to stay at his place. So you've decided to stay away from me. I didn't mean that. Mr. Udhayan, don't you've any share in my success? If it is so, then why I am not able to achieve that success? Even if I hadn't recommended you for my mentor's movie.. ...you'd have been in movies because.. ...you were born for that. I loved acting, that's why I came to cinema. And because of the same reason, I am ending it. I already told you regarding my father and brother Dinesh. They are bargaining with the directors.. ...like one does in the street markets. The beggars can't be choosers. Do you want good film or more money? There is not even a single good film this year for me. I am fed up. Sir, shall I attend? What's the use of you being her manager? When she went out of the sets, you should have stopped her! Attend the phone and listen to the abuses of the producer. And tell him that nobody is here. Go out and play you stupid! Why are you getting annoyed with the children? Babu and Bhama came to watch the dance pro-gramme together. Kanchana, give me some peace of mind. I've taken the advance, so I am bound to reply. She is coming. Dinesh, be cool and don't be angry with her. It seems that she won't go for the shoot today. You know her habit. And may be she'll cancel the film itself. So should I be scared of her? Laxmi, come here. Not everyone is lucky and blessed with God's grace. I just want to say that we should not spoil it ourselves. Who'll bear the loss if the shooting is canceled? The one who has taken the money will bear the loss. What do you think of yourself? Sofia Lauren or Elizabeth Taylor? If 60 Malayalam films are released in a year.. ...out of that 55 films are flop. And people like you are acting in it. You are not the only one good actress around. What if you won't get good films for the next five years? I'll not act. - Then who'll bear your expenditure? Look, you should not forget your status. What relation you've got with that unsuccessful director? We are ashamed of the gossips.. ...that are published in the magazines. You stopped the shooting and went to meet him, isn't it? Who is he? Is he your father? - Dinesh! Father, keep quiet. - Actually, what is the main issue? The cancellation of the shooting.. ...or that I had gone to meet Mr. Udhayan? We want to know the decision on both the matters. And right now. - All right, I'll tell. I'll not act in the film directed by KP Nanappan. And about Mr. Udhayan, that can't be said in one word. And I'll have to describe. Not because he brought me into the films, but because he understands.. ...the feelings of human and because he is talented.. ...I love and respect Mr. Udhayan. But Mr. Udhayan had never told me that he love me. And if he says it? Father, did you understand? That she'll go if he agrees. Do you know he is older than me? And accordingly Mr. Udhayan is matured too! - I will.. No Dinesh, no. It's my mistake. Instead of treating both children equally.. ...I spent 75% of my income on her. And for that you might have profited 100 times by now. At least you can spare me now. Udhayan, I heard that you got a terrific climax. Rafiq, that's up to the audience to decide. Then too Udhayan, you might be having some calculations. When are you going to start the shooting? For that one needs a producer. Didn't you contact anyone? Rafiq, asst. director is like a bride waiting for her marriage. The bridegroom, that is the producer will examine. And if they like it then only the marriage is solemnized. Udhayan, they will like the story. Only men like Udhayan can save Malayalam films. Look, you've taken the name and he is here. You know, I am the second hero of GK Nair's next film. Two fights and one song. Isn't there any scenes or dialogues for you? I am talking about other than scenes and dialogues. He is a much better actor than us. No, when is the shooting? That's the problem it is after two months. Till that time? - I'll get the advance within in two weeks. That'd be better if it is given at the earliest. Who is the hero of your film? Most probably it'd be Prasad Chandran. Heroine as it is would be Madhumati, isn't it? Udhayan, I never meant that. Madhumati is a well-known star now. And Udhayan, you know her very well. There are many other well know stars.. ...In Malayalam whom I know. If you ask anyone who is the best actress on date, then.. If the friends circle itself gossips about me.. ...then why to blame others. Udhayan, I didn't really have any bad intentions. You know Rafiq, after I wrote the climax.. ...I wake up daily at 5 o'clock in the morning. I go out with this camera and shoot many visuals and.. ...locations to fix the angles and composition in the mind. Udhayabhanu has just one love and that is cinema. He has only one wife and that is cinema. Why didn't I marry for all these years? Because I was afraid that I'll lose my concentration. I shouldn't have asked this question. But I can tell one thing. Madhumati has something for Udhayan. - What? What are you talking? - I never told that you have. But if I were in your place I'd have married and lived happily. At least I'd have been a husband of a star. Then you go and marry her. Go and marry her man! But for that she too must agree. - I'll make her agree. Forget it. - The way he is annoying at us, seems.. What? - Nothing. No Rajappan, no. - You are behaving like children. Udhayan, we too will have some roles, isn't it? I already said that let a producer come. - Correct. All right Udhayan, I am going to AVM. I've a small role there, which will get me Rs. 500. All right, see you in the evening. - Fine. Many of them were asking. Are you listening Udhayan. Yes, many of them were asking. Why are you not asking what they were asking? Many of them are asking then why should I ask? That Udhayabhanu is your close friend. And are you the hero of his first film? Call the one who has told this? I'll smash his face! I can act better than your Prasad Chandran. I don't want the person who acts too much. I saw your acting in the film Nattu Gawda. This is not the way of acting by looking at the sister who was raped. Is this the way of expressing your sorrows? I didn't do like that? - Yes, you did. And it's because of that the director.. ...cut down your scene from the film. What you thought? That I was not aware of these things? Look, acting is to be done meticulously, like a heart operation. God! He has started again. I'll act the way you say. Now you can't say that you don't know to tell how to act. That's not the thing. First of all, my actor is very handsome. Makeup is meant for that. But for makeup too there is a limit. Marlene Brandon, Alpachino, Robert Dinero.. ...Densel Washington, Laurence Sylvan. ...Jack Nicholson, Anthony Hawkins, Sanjeev Kumar.. ...Ashok Kumar, Naseeruddin Shah, Paresh Rawal etc.. ...go and watch the films of these stars. And learn what acting is. Or else go back to native place and.. ...do some other job and feed your family. If you ask for a chance in my film, then.. They won't allow any peace of mind. Producer Sonabalan speaking. It was you! I thought someone has called for their money. Last film? it was an utter flop. Don't you know that? Looking at the trend of the comedy a film was made with all mimicry artist. And it was an utter flop. Now I show mimicry when people ask for their money. That Sonabalan is not there or like this is not Sonabalan. Abdulla, someone has come. May be it is Marwari Mukesh. He said that he'd arrange for some money. I'll call you later. Good morning Sir. Rajappan, didn't I tell you yesterday, that.. ...I am not going to make any films as of now. Don't come here asking for chances. But Sir, that was yesterday. Maybe you've changed your decision today. My God! What should I do with him? Sir, how many times I came to you for a good role? Rajappan, don't kill me. My mimicry film was an utter flop. And now even if I want to make films.. ...there should be some stories and screenplay. For God sake, don't come here to meet me again. So.. I.. come tomorrow.. Mr. Balan is not going to make any new films, isn't it? I don't know. Just remind him if he is making anything new. Of course. I'll remind him all the three times. Morning, afternoon and in the evening. Will that do? There is a need to appoint a watchman. Look, didn't you see stupid Rajappan coming? RajaPPan, didn't you go? Would you like to have some tea? Till today my name was Rajappan Thengamuda. Now it has also known as stupid Rajappan. Actually, I was telling him to buy some.. Sir, it's all right. But I was thinking about you. You don't have the screenplay, isn't it? - Yes. If I give you a good screenplay, will you give me the lead role? What do you mean by good screenplay? Sir, you haven't left comedy though.. ...your comedy film is an utter flop. Sir, accept it only if you like it after reading it. Have you written it? I have been here for a while now. I can write at least one. Even the greatest writers have kept their pen down. Thinking what to write in these conditions. And you are going to write stories. Raja c'mon. Sir, at least you should read this. C'mon, drive man. - Sir, please. Please. Oh God! He is just troubling me. Do one thing, bring it and give it to him. I'll read it. Now take the vehicle, c'mon. That's fine. - Thank you Sir. Take the copy of all the pages. - Fine. That should be neat. And put a cover for them but tomorrow. But now you give me the originals properly. - OK. Rajappan! Why did you run when I called you? Who called me? And when did you call me? Rajappan, don't try to fool me. I called you, you saw me and ran away. And I wanted to know why you ran? What was the packet in your hand? You've seen the packet, isn't it? That means it is true that you've seen me. The packet contained clothes for ironing. It was true that I ran. I gave.. Rs. 100 to Paneer Shelvam.. ...to change pipe in my old room. Since then he is missing. Today I saw him and was running catch him. Paneer Shelvam? Which Paneer Shelvam? Which all Paneer Shelvam do you know? If you think that I ran because you saw me.. ...then I should be running now too. Yes, that is what I do not understand. Did he steal something from here? Listen, I forgot to tell you one thing. I've arranged for a producer. He is a very rich man. He is in abroad. Though you've not offered any role to me.. ...I've said lot of things to him about you. Did you say too much? - I said lot of things about you. But you'll have to wait for six months. Because he'll be coming after six months. - Go man! I am going to Ernakulam next week. To meet Baby Kuttan and tell the story. And will start the shooting within two months if he likes the story. Udhayan, no.. listen to me. The producer must have sufficient money. Baby Kuttan is a poor chap. Why can't you wait for six months? Do you know what is name is? Francis.. Francis.. He is from Kozhencherry. I am not a fool to listen to what you are boasting. Hello, is this movie director Mr. Pratapan. Yes Balan, what's the matter? I've got a fantastic screenplay. I've just finished reading it. Mr. Pratapan, this is called as trendsetter. I am not telling anything more. I'll get you the screenplay. No one else can direct this film than Mr. Pratapan in Malayalam cinema. Don't make a conclusion like that. So who has written the screenplay? That's another surprise. I'll tell you everything personally. First I'll get you the screenplay. Greetings. - Greetings. Have you read that? - Yes, I read. Tell me truly Mr. Balan Pillai, if Rajappan, who is still.. ...waiting for a chance to act has written this story? You don't believe, isn't it? I've learnt a lesson from this. That we should not misbehave with those.. ...who come and ask for chance for acting. Art is really surprising? We can't say which stupid has got this talent? But I'll tell you one thing. People will mock if he is in the lead role. He'll not give the screenplay if he is not in the lead role. Is it? We'll play rest all characters with strong actors. Mr. Balan Pillai, the building will collapse if the foundation is not strong. But our foundation is the screenplay. Then Balan, you do the lead role. Are you serious? I'll talk to him. I'll come to your office in the evening. That's not possible. Then look for some other director. - I mean.. Sir, I'll tell. I'll ask him to come to the office. If it is so, then I am leaving. Sir, give my screenplay back. Rajappan, sit down. - I do have chair at home to sit. Shall I ask you something? Don't you wish to see your screenplay a big hit, Rajappan? My wish is to see the film doing well by doing.. ...the lead role of Ravi of my screenplay. Ravi is a young guy and then Rajappan.. ...how can you fit in to that role? MGR at the age of 65 used wig and.. ...played the role of lover. And I am not that old. But then, why are we arguing, let me go. Mr. Balan, give my screenplay back. Rajappan, some of the best writers like Bhasi and.. ...Bhaskaran has left us and gone. MT and T Dhamodharan write occasionally. - So? Rajappan, you can become.. ...No. 1 story writer in Malayalam films. And I'll direct all the screenplays written by you. I only know howl managed this one. Mr. Balan, give me the screenplay. Rajappan, try to understand. The role of Ravi is strong and needs in-depth acting. It is me who has created the character. And so I know how to act too. I know acting is what reacting. It is behaving. You know what Sansloviski said about acting. I too know a lot things films. Mr. Pratapan, just a minute. What's so secret? - Please Sir. Give my screenplay back. - Wait a minute, Rajappan. My dear Mr. Pratapan, we've made lot of new faces.. ...super stars while they didn't knew even the ABC of acting. Dear Balan, he doesn't have the height and body to play that particular character. He is not handsome. You too have read the screenplay. If that's the case, Mr. Satyan wasn't tall. And didn't have good complexion. Look, don't compare great actors like Satyan with him, or else I'll smash your face. Don't get annoyed. We'll call Pachallan Bhasi.. ...the one who teaches Kathakalli and dances. We'll ask him to train before the shooting starts. He is very smart. He'll teach him all the expressions. And then? - Then we'll proceed.. How? How? Mr. Pratapan, I am in heavy debts. And if Rajappan acts in this film.. ...all the astrologers say it will be a great hit. - Is it? Then ask the astrologers to direct the film. But the film will be a utter flop if Mr. Pratap.. ...doesn't direct it, the astrologers said it. Balan Pillai, if the film is to do well.. ...all the aspects should be looked into. And you all have no sense. Please compromise for once. Truly speaking.. ...I've brought cheque to pay him the advance. Let me pay it before the time runs out. - Balan Pillai.. Udhayan, you were in Kerala, isn't it? I went to meet producer Baby Kuttan. He liked my screenplay very much. But Prasad Chandran is very busy. Baby Kuttan is ready to start the film anytime. Is that busy Prasad Chandran. He is busy with couple of films. I'll have to press him again. Do you know something? Do you know who is the hero.. ...of director Mr. Pratapan's new film? Our Rajappan! Rajappan? - Yes. Rajappan in Mr. Pratapan's film? - Yes. How did that happen? Normally, Mr. Pratapan doesn't make such mistakes. You are right. I didn't believe it. But that is true. Rajappan got the advance. He has taken a room on rent nearby. And Pachallan Bhasi is training him. Oh God! What am I hearing? Anyway poor fellow, let him survive. All right then. - Fine. If you've come to see Rajappan he is busy doing Shirsh-asan. I am Rajappan's friend Udhayabhanu. I am Pachallan Bhasi and I am training Rajappan. I'll wait till he finishes the Shirsa-asan. No, no, after Shirsh-asan, he'll be doing Padma-asan. After that Kukud-as an. Then Sarvanga-asan. Then Mayur-asan and in the end Shava-asan. Then he'll begin his actual training. And it's a very tough training. I'll tell you in details. This is Shringaram. This is Karunam. Veeram. Roudram. Hasyam. Bhayanakam. Bhirvasam Albutam and Shantam. And there are other four, which I've invented. There is a lot to be taught and time is very short. So now, no friend or enemy is allowed to disturb him. You may go now. What's this? You are doing Shava-asan directly from Shirsh-asan. I'll do the rest of the Asans afterward. Who knocked the door? - He said some name. And said he is your friend. Something like Udhayan.. Bhanu.. I said you are doing Asans and closed the doors. Then don't waste time lets start the training. Do you know how Rasan comes? It doesn't come, but we have to make it. All right, then how to make it? I don' know exactly, but still I can tell you. First we should boil the lentils. A tomato can be used. Then black pepper and asafoetida is to be added. Then oil is to be heated and green leaves and onions.. ...are to be fried in it along with garlic. There is no need to take that much trouble. You'll get the powder for making Rasam in the shop! Yes, we can get it. Mister, I am talking about Navrasam! He is simply stupid! This is Srirangam. Do it. This is not the way I've shown. You are doing the act of the cow releasing the cow-dung. Do it the way I did. Why are you shaking your body while doing Sringaram? What is written in Natya Shastra? - That.. that.. What Bharatmuni said in Natya Shastra? What you know about Bharatmuni and Natya Shastra? This is Kabayil. Virugal. You should concentrate on your eyes. Your eyes should express everything. So with out shaking your body.. ...show me the Navrasam with your face. Come here. This is Karunam. Do it like this. It cannot be done so easily as my master could. You should kindly give me some time. Brother Bhaskaran! Brother Bhaskaran! - Yes. What's the matter? Did you find any climax again? No brother Bhaskaran, Baby Kuttan is coming here. He just called me. Gopi Kuttan? - It's not Gopi Kuttan. It's Baby Kuttan, the producer of my film. He has come. We've to discuss a lot of things. So I don't have time to make tea. So you should make tea for us. He is not aware of this place. So I am going to pick him up. - OK. This is not the right place for a director.. ...whose film is going to be a hit. People should see my movie. Place is not a problem for me. I stay over there. Come. I've to attend a marriage of a family friend. I've to take a print of my last film Prasad lab and sent it to Dubai. And before that I want to amend my mistake. Mistake? - Why, haven't you heard this word before? Yes mistake. - What mistake did Baby Kuttan do? Come, I'll tell you. Don't think that just directors can make dramas. A producer can.. Brother Bhaskaran, this is the one I said.. Yes I understood.. Gopi Kuttan! - What? Baby Kuttan. He stays in the neighbourhood. When friends visit, Brother Bhaskaran prepares tea. Don't think that he is a tea-maker. Brother Bhaskaran, we've to discuss something. Yes, I understood, I understood. So what were you telling? A producer.. Yes, a producer listened to the story. He liked it and decided to do it. But didn't pay the advance. That's a mistake, isn't it? It's not that I forgot. But we've to see the time too, isn't it? Now take this. Baby Kuttan, between us there.. Friendship is different and films are different. Now take this. It's a new film directed by Mr. Pratapan. I am just coming back from the Pooja. Weren't you aware of it, Mr. Udhayan? Your friend Rajappan is the hero of the film. And I am the heroine. Mr. Udhayan, the story is excellent. He is a new fellow. And his name is something like Ajay. I don't know him. Mr. Udhayan, where are you now? I am out since morning. I've to find a couple of houses to shoot. For which film? - That Madhu, I was about to tell you. Baby Kuttan liked the screen-play very much which I wrote. And after waiting for long time.. ...work on my first film is going to start. Is it true? Oh great news! Sister Laxmi, Mr. Udhayan is going to direct a film. - Is it? I don't have any shoot till afternoon. Mr. Udhayan, where are you now? I am in the Ambedkar Housing Colony. Stop! Stop! - What to stop? Stop it! - I am nearby. You are where in Ambedkar Colony? Just turn around. - But where? Can't you see my car? So you called me from the car. - Yes. The daughter of my make-up man is not well. I am going to meet her. I never knew we were so close. Didn't they call Mr. Udhayan for the Pooja? No, I was not aware of it. Moreover, who'll call a asst. director for the Pooja? Rajappan could've called you. - He might have forgotten. I feel really sorry for Mr. Pratapan has made him hero. He is not a problem. Many times he was awarded.. ...for the best actor in his school days. No, I've seen his small roles in a couple of films. He'll express only if he is given electric shock. Won't you allow me to act in your film? - That.. Think it over. Mr. Udhayan, get into the car. I'll tell you the story of Mr. Pratapan. It's a wonderful story. Madhu, I am really very busy. I've to do lot of things. I'll see you later. I'll call you. - You are lying. Sure, I'll call you in the evening. - OK. All right Sir. - Thank you. Udhayan. - Sir. I wanted to know if you could work with me. Udhayan, you were in native place, isn't it? So Pratapan, don't you know that Baby Kuttan's.. ...next film is going to be directed by Udhayan. He has taken the advance too. Very good, my hearty congratulation. Thank you Sir, thank you. It's very good. You have so many years of experience. The directors just having the experience of one film.. ...are making the producers dance. Udhayan, you've been in the films since when? It's around 10-12 years. - Oh my goodness! And now the time has come. Who has written the screenplay? You know Sir it's my wish to make my film. .It's the hard work of so many years. Baby Kuttan liked it and thus.. Very good, very good. It's very good if the director can write. And by the way Rajappan and Udhayan are friends, isn't it? Yes, I've come to meet Rajappan. Rajappan is acting as a hero in this film, isn't it? Rajappan was here somewhere. To be honest Udhayan, I don't think he can do this role. The screenplay has really surprised me. He has written that, I.. - Udhayan! Come here. Come here. Who has invited you to come here? You left the room without saying anything. I came to meet you twice at your house. But couldn't meet you though you were inside. What mistake did I do to you? You said that I'll never a get a good role. I'll never forget that. I don't like to even see you. - Look.. I just joked. Is this the way to joke? You stabbed my chest and you are saying that it is a joke. Now go from here. RM "Girl! My girl!" "Do you have the honey of love on your lips, girl." "Eyes! That's my eye!" "Do you have the moonlight in your eyes, girl" "Without touching with hands." "And without seeing." "The sky is a golden plate." "I wish to have plate of honey." "Girl! My girl!" "Do you have the honey of love on your lips, girl." RM "You asked for a touch of the lips." "And silence is the answer." "That you asked for a sweet." "And the sweet answered, unknowingly." "Don't ask me anything more." "Don't ask me anything more, my dear." "What's there on your cheeks?" "Oh my dream beauty." "Don't tell anybody what you saw." "Don't tell anybody what you heard." "Don't break the things that you touch." "Girl! My girl!" "Do you have the honey of love on your lips, girl." RM Udhayan! Baby Kuttan? - I am still trembling. Did you read the film news? - No, what happened? Who is this Ajayan? - Ajayan! The storywriter of the Sona films. I don't know, what's the matter? Some of the reports and.. ..scenes of the film have come in this. It's the same scene as that of Udhayan's screenplay. The same dialogues!- What? Udhayan, did you give your story to anyone to read?- No. Nobody else other than Baby Kuttan has read that. No Udhayan, we've been cheated. I am sure. But can Pratapan do that? Come, come. Sir, I want to talk to you something important. Can you come inside? Udhayan, why your face is so dull? Sir, I'll tell you. Greetings. Oh Sorry! Rajappan has given us the xerox copy of the screenplay. The original is with Udhayan. Balan Pillai, I told you that day itself that.. ...some well-informed person has written this. Udhayan, we are innocent. I am doing films after taking loans from wherever I could. We understand Udhayan's ordeal. But if you file a case against this.. ...I'll be left with no other way than suicide. I'll call Rajappan and prove the truth. Udhayan, I'll pay you something. Balan Pillai, don't talk nonsense. Now what is there to prove? I know what kind of man is Udhayan. - I too know that. Then we'll give the name of Udhayabhanu.. ..for story, screenplay and dialogues, isn't it? I've not come here for your money and name. Don't put the price for my life! I've toiled very much to write the screenplay. So can't I make the film now? How is that possible now, Udhayan? - Enough! I just want to know that. - Udhayan. What was noise? It was my mistake. Even after knowing that you are a bad character.. ...I allowed you to stay in my house. But I never expected this kind of cheating. You've not taken my screenplay.. ...but you've snatched my life! Now will you repeat this to anyone.. move! Rajappan! Sit here. I came to know about it while shooting in Santhom. Mr. Udhayan, do you remember we met.. ...on the road..while coming back from Pooja? - Yes. That day you didn't wait to listen the story. If you had heard it that day.. - Before shooting? Shooting started after two weeks of the Pooja. This cheating wouldn't have happened.. ...If we had known it that day. Now what's the use of saying all these things? But what's the use of beating him? That's what I asked Udhayan too. Normally, what do we do when there is a theft case? We go to police or to the court, isn't it? Brother Bhaskaran, did you do that.. ..when your screenplay was lost? Just whistling by sitting in the gallery is different.. ...and to play a game is different. I worked on it for months. My first film, it was my dream. Everything has gone. One should suffer to understand that pain. Dear, your father and brother are coming here. Come here! - Leave me! I've given you enough freedom. Now I won't allow this. - I said to leave me! - Come here! Dinesh, leave her! - Father, don't talk. I want to know what she has got to do.. ...with these scoundrels at night time! Come here! I won't tolerate it if you spoil the reputation of the family. Get in! I've ended everything. They didn't even give me the consideration.. ..of a human being and tortured me. I can't live with them anymore. I left them, but didn't know where to go. Madhu, what is all this? How long should I suffer... for the mistakes I haven't committed? They think that we are in love. Come in. They didn't ask you where are you going.. ...while leaving the house? I may go anywhere, but I told them I'd never come back. But Madhu, what if they come here again. And create a scene like last night. I am already fed up with the gossips written about us.. ...In the magazines without any reason. Madhu, I am already in trauma. You want to trouble me more? Sorry, I didn't think about that. You know Madhu I am nowhere. And don't know what to do next. I am not in position to share the sorrow of others. Anyway, they are your own father and brother. If you go back, they will not discard you. It's better to die then. Then what are you going to do now? - I don't know. I don't know. Hello, wrong number. No, don't take. They'll create problem if the door is not opened. Then father, you go and open it. I can't talk to them on this shameful topic. She married that scoundrel, what can we say on that? Oh God! Please save us from the media! Look, not a single person will get inside! You just go out to eat human bodies like vultures! The wretched hasn't come here after marriage. And we don't know where she is. What is your reaction on the incident? The sky won't fall if I don't react. If a girl is going well with her film career.. ...some scoundrel will come and grab her. And it's a routine affair in Malayalam cinema. Don't be scared. Nobody knows that I've come here. Just give me some space.. Good and I appreciate. It's good that it's arranged in a secret place. Or else to control the media, we'd have needed police. Congratulations! Take this. It's a gift from me. What is this? It's a marriage gift. For what? I didn't invite anybody for marriage. I know. But I like to act according to the situation. There are lot of expenditures during marriage. I just needed Rs. 250 for the registrar office. And I had it. Registrar office is not the end of the marriage, isn't it? Now if you want to go to Ooty or Kodaikanal.. ...for honeymoon, it's an expenditure, isn't it? Sir, I'll come your house before going there! No problem, take this. I don't like to see the face of the people.. ...responsible for my ruin. Madhumati! You married without informing us. Anyway, congratulations. But one thing.. ...because you are married, don't leave films.. ...like other Malayalam actresses. We want good characters of Madhu. Tea. - No, I don't drink tea and coffee. Best wishes, bye then. How did he find this place? Rafiq, come with me. You know somehow we managed to pay the advance for this room. For now, there is no other way. Rafiq, sell this camera and get me some money. Nobody should know this. - Fine. All right Udhayan, we are leaving. - OK. You've got to do lot of things. Call me if you need something. - Fine. Bye dear. - Bye. Mr. Udhayan, it's only money and gold that can be robbed. Nobody can snatch one's talent. Mr. Udhayan can write again. You should write. You can become a well-known filmmaker. I thought of asking one thing many times. Shall I ask you now? - You can ask. Mr. Udhayan, did you ever feel like love for me? Madhu, you don't know how much I loved you. But for the sake of Madhu's prosperity, I didn't express it. Hello, is this producer? I am Pachallan Bhasi. I and Rajappan.. no Saroj Kumar.. ...Is hiding and staying at the same place. Kumar is very anxious. The film is being released in Kerala today. The matinee show is finished. Did you get any information? What? Super hit? Bumper hit? Oh my God! Bumper hit! Rajappan! The film is a bumper hit! Give the money! - Hit! Hit! What's the matter? - The film is bumper hit, go and see! Film is bumper hit! Hit! Yes come in. Come Udhayan, the train was in time, isn't it? - Yes. Then freshen up yourself we'll talk after having the breakfast. Baby Kuttan, when I called you.. ...you didn't say anything about the screenplay. Didn't you like it? It's not possible to answer in one word. First you get fresh, and then we can talk. That's not important. When I read Udhayan's first story.. ...I knew it was a sure bet. This.. may be we'd get awards. But that's not our main motto. I never thought of awards too. And who wants the approval of these crooked minds. But I don't want to show.. ..mimicry and ruin Malayalam cinema. I too don't want that. But cinema is meant to entertain people. Which people? - I am not arguing. I am arguing. You producers undervalue the cine goers. Because there are no good movies.. ...they watch mimicry and clap hands. Seeing this, you decide they want low films. That is not the truth. The director and heroes which gave them good films once.. ...are constantly cheating them now by giving cheap films. That's why they are clapping hands.. ..after seeing the mimicry, understand. They'll come back surely to see good films. It's good if they come. We should not waste time talking useless things. And coming to the point.. ...Prasad Chandran's popularity has gone too low. Then? - In the film industry, there are no...permanent friends and enemies. That is what experience taught us, isn't it? There is a proverb, forget the past and live in the present. Don't get annoyed. If we make Saroj Kumar our hero, everything will be fine. These days he is very popular. People are crazy about him. That's the reason Baby Kuttan has gone against my story. No.. it's not that. If you had said this on the phone.. ...I could have avoided a journey. Does forget the past mean to honor the cheater? And does living in the present means to do a film.. ...I should forget my self-respect and conscious? This is a post-dated cheque. Somehow I'll put the money.. ...In your account in one month. The advance, which Baby Kuttan.. ..gave me for the first film. Take this. - Udhayan, between us.. Friendship and films are both different things. I got to know it. People will throw stones on the tree, which bear fruits. He may be someone who is jealous of my prosperity. I am riding high where nobody else could reach. And I take it as a proof of that. Isn't that a compliment? I've given seven hit films in a row. People love me very much. And because of this, many of them are sleepless. They are not just throwing stones, they are giving.. ...money to people to shout in the theaters running my film. But that's not a problem. My fans will reply suitably. Which are your forthcoming films? - There are many. I don't remember the names. Who is directing your films? Whoever may direct, but it's me who is acting! My fans just want to see me for two and half hours. For that I need to dress colourfully. Change the goggles often. Couple of heroines should love me. And nobody notices who the director is. You said you'd be back in two days. I was bored. I am fed up discussing with the producers. Could you succeed? - No. Why were you annoyed at Baby Kuttan? Who told you? - Baby Kuttan called here. And said that you returned the advance. To return one's money is not annoyance. We should forget the past and do films with Rajappan.. ...that is what Baby Kuttan saying. Madhu, it's not just Baby Kuttan, all the stupid.. ...whom I told the story were saying the same. Nobody is going to slit my head.. ...If I am not going to do the films, isn't it. The robber Rajappan and that too a hero in my film! I was watching his interview. It was fun. If I was not in films, I'd have been some.. ...doctor or collector or something like that. Along with the art, I was studious.. ...and used to be first in schools and college. I was the captain of the cricket team and kabaddi team. And lot of captains. - Then Mr. Saroj.. Switch it of, Madhu. He's simply talking rubbish. This is better than his films. Mr, Udhayan, don't get annoyed and see this, come. I got flu a day a before the IAS exam. I still remember my father cried. Do you have any dream character? - Yes, I have. Which is that? - Karnan.. Karnan, Arjunan.. ...Nelson Mandela, Gandhi-ji. Actor Prasad Chandran too wanted to act as Karnan. That Karnan is not this Karnan. Then Gandhi-ji too would be different, isn't it? When Saroj Kumar does it, it's different. It is said that you stole the story of Udhayabhanu.. ...and became hero in your first film. Me? Stole a story! By the way who is Udhayabhanu? I am hearing such name for the first time. Does Udhayabhanu have the caliber of Thakazhi and MT? Udhayabhanu! The Malayalam films are in the hands of thief like him. Idiot! Stupid! Mr. Udhayan, you should go along with.. For that, you'll not get me! Do you've the money to honor the cheque.. ...given to Baby Kuttan in your account? Somehow we paid the rent of the house last month. To do a film according to Mr. Udhayan's wish.. ...a producer may come, but till then" I am also thinking about these things. There may be some work to do. Brother Bhaskaran. - Where are you these days? I called once. Udhayan had gone to native place, isn't it? - Yes. Brother Bhaskaran, are you busy? I want to talk to you about something. No, I am not busy. Tell me. The MD of KC Group, Joseph Cherian's brother.. ...do you've any connection with him now? He is a big shot now. He has 5-6 restaurants in the city. He is a nice guy, but I've seen him long before. What's the matter? I don't think my film will come out soon. I thought of working as assistant as I used to. But nobody has the film. I am not alone now, isn't it? Can you tell.. Joseph Cherian for a job.. - No problem. I heard that he deals with.. ...out door catering and many other things. That won't look good for you, Udhayan. I've to do it. - Then come, there is no need to postpone. You should've called me. You were bathing. But I forgot and made tea just for me. I had it in the morning. When I saw that, you were sleeping nicely. Are you not going for the discussion? Discussion? For what? That's nice question. Daily morning you get ready.. ...and go to discuss the film story. And now you are asking me what discussion? - That. Madhu, that story is not going to happen. What happened? - He went out to conquer the world. But gradually he lost his soldiers and weapons. Now life is staring at him and asking the question. You want the world or food to kill the hunger. That is the question to deal now. If you get the world, then food is not a problem. Conquering the world is a dream now. And we need food to survive. Everything will be all right, Mr. Udhayan. I knew you were in a bad mood. Other than asking about the household items ...you rarely talk to me. I came to know the reason now. These obstacles are for time being. Everything will be all right and I am sure. Mr. Udhayan will become a well-known director. I don't have any hope now. Since many days I was thinking something. There are many who do acting even after marriage. Then why should I sit idle? Madhu, it was you who decided not to act. That was because I was fed up doing bad characters. Did anybody call you for good roles? - No. Maybe it's because, they think I've stopped acting. And there is no use of seeing if it's good or bad. There are many films which we don't like.. ...and people like them very much. You understand things very soon. You are fed up with this small life, isn't it? There were lot of fans and lot of people at your command. Now you are missing the glamorous world, isn't it? Mr. Udhayan, what are you saying? Our life belongs to both of us. And I should do my part, isn't it? So it's because of that and not because you want to act. You want to share equally. And to be more clear Madhu, you are afraid.. ...that my income is not sufficient to carry on, isn't it? The one who can write stories can say that way too. Then Madhu tell me, how should I say it? You once got out of the set as the scene was not good. And now you are telling there is no need.. ...to see if the role is good or bad. OK, I won't go and act. I'll try for some other job. No, not now. if I were a big director and.. ...had sufficient money, I'd have allowed it. If you do job under these circumstances.. ...that will hurt my ego. Mr. Udhayan, you have these complex too? Yes, of course. I never thought. - I'd have said if you had asked. Madhu, don't take it out what's there inside. Don't argue and give me peace of mind. I didn't argue, I was asking opinion.. This is argument! This is an argument! You are drinking too much. How many did you have? I saw when you came. But thought not to disturb you. Do you know me? I am the producer of Chuvanthangi. Jomon Kandathil. We've met couple of times. - I don't remember. But we cannot forget. You are lucky, lucky. You've grabbed the beautiful actress of Malayalam cinema. I became a producer to make her heroine in my film. I am late. But I'll tell you one thing. A heroine means is the property of in the industry. And to keep them closed in a room.. ...without letting them to act is not a good thing. If Madhumati is willing to act, I'll produce film again. That's my wish. Tell me would you allow her to act again? I'll give you another offer. You can direct the film she is acting. C'mon, I am ready for the arguments. C'mon, what's your problem? Tell me everything, one by one. But I tell you, this is one and only day you can argue. Here after no arguments. I want peace of mind. C'mon speak UP! You.. you don't have anything to say. OK, then good night. Don't stare at me like that. If I were in America, police would charge the one staring. You know something.. ...I used to drink occasionally to celebrate. Now I drink for peace of mind. That's the difference. I had peace of mind when I was alone. Every time I used to think just about the cinema. It has gone. I lost everything! Everything.. everything. Everything. Hello. - I am Madhumati. Who? - I am Madhumati. Mr. Udhayan, I came that day without your permission. The same way I've come from there. We lived together without understanding each other. Now we'll not continue, Mr. Udhayan. You can go your way and I'll go mine, good-bye. - Madhu? It's my fault, not her fault. The girl who lived luxuriously, I closed her in a small room. Did I give her good food, good clothes? Did I take her anywhere? No, I did nothing. I did nothing. No one can handicap me and go ahead, ridiculous. What Udhayabhanu? He can't do anything. What did he do to Rajappan who stole the screenplay? God is sending everyone to ruin my life. I don't have anything left. There is no cinema.. no family.. I don't have anything left. Cinema has gone.. my family.. Gone.. she.. has gone. Udhayan come. Get into the vehicle. I don't have anything left. Wash your face and have tea. Udhayan, have you ever treated me as your friend? Why are you asking so? If so, then I want some freedom to say something. Liquor won't help you to forget your sorrows. Liquor just ruins one's life. Udhayan, do you want to ruin your life? By all means I am nowhere. But liquor is not the solution for all your problems. Udhayan, I thought you were a talented artist. Creating something and that too with the experience.. ...of one's own life, makes him different from others. It is through the pain of confronting.. ...and resolving problems that we learn. It's not my invention. Some thinkers have said this. You are not the one to be ruined. I have faith in you. You should do films. I'll do the financing. You can give the roles to anyone you like. Baby Kuttan, are you telling the truth? Do you have any doubts? We'll make good films. Udhayan, you'll become a famous director. But I won't put any conditions. I must understand that cinema is business too. I remember you said there are no permanent enemies in cinema. That's great. This September? You want the call sheet of Mr. Saroj Kumar this September! Mr. Baby Kuttan, you are living in which world? For next seven years super star Saroj Kumar.. ...don't have a single date. Even small kids know that. It's just you who don't know that. And in between, I'll be producing six films. Everyone is making money out of Saroj Kumar. Not only that I'll not give date to outsiders after sever years. Saroj-Pachallan Combined Productions will produce.. ...and distribute the films and make money. I'd like to talk to Mr. Saroj directly. Directly with Mr. Saroj? That's of no use. Here everything is under my control. Look after it carefully it will be another 4 days before I come. OK Mr. Baby Kuttan. I am going to airport in a Benz car. Then good-bye. Move, move. Security! Security! Don't crowd, don't get crowd, please. Baby Kuttan is there. Don't notice him. Hello Sir. - Key please. Thanks. Hello.. Saroj.. This lift is meant only for Mr. Saroj. The thing is.. - There is nothing. We'll have something to eat from the restaurant and then go to the room. Why did Baby Kuttan come? For dates and not to see the hotel. Oh! The restaurant is not here it's on that side. The other day I talked to Baby Kuttan. I said that there is no date for seven years. Who is the director? - Whoever it is? We should not give date to outside producers. Saroj-Pachallan's Combines is enough. They will not last long. Lot of things were written about the last film Mundanikadavattu. The producer will be ruined. So it's better to make money as soon as possible. And for that we should produce the films. Satellite and overseas everything will be with us. You look old though you have makeup on. There are some wrinkles too. How long can you take the lead role then? It's better to start some side business. What side business? Something like spices and pickles. Good evening Sir. - Good evening, evening. What is there to eat? What do you like to have? - What? I asked what you would like to eat. Six 'Parottas' and fried mutton for the two peoples! Anything else, sir? - He doesn't eat that? I meant to ask if you want anything else. - No. Bring this first. - Thank you sir. I had not learnt enough English in my younger days. Greetings! May I sit here? - Date.. Don't worry. I have not come to talk about dates. We have met and spoken to each other many times. But I had not been able to open my heart to you then. I am a great fan of Saroj's. When my father was working for Air lndia.. ...at Bombay, Amir Khan and I studied sitting at the same bench. He has told me many times to.. ...make a Hindi film with him. I am not Amir Khan's fan. Because I am an art lover. What art? - I see that art in you, Saroj. OK that art. Sir. Sir, you are not allowed to smoke in here. - OK. Pachalam, call the owner of this hotel and.. ...ask him to dismiss him right now. - OK. There were many talented actors in Malayalam. But to sing, dance, do action scenes, express. ...well all by one person! In short Saroj is a super market for acting. If he went through the door of a shop all the.. ...stuff in there would have to walk out. But as an admirer there is one thing I feel bad about. I can't get the owner on line. Is it? Then we can dismiss him after a while. And what is it? You haven't got a single national award. Nor has he got a state award! We must remove that deficiency. Award is not what you can get by just acting in any movie. It needs to have a good story. - Correct! We have already made the story. Aren't you interested in awards? Of course he is. He lost 10-25 lakhs last year after the state award. The jury Chairman was a man who didn't know Saroj Sir's rate. He should not be called the jury chairman. Pachalam! Who are the 'we' who has made the story? It is me along with a friend of mine. Who is that? - You know each other. There is no point keeping the past in your mind. He has forgotten about it. I am talking about Udhaya. I suspected it. In front of my eyes he hit Rajappan.. Pachalam! - He thrashed Saroj Sir like one hits a dog! Mr. Baby Kuttan, he went around the country side.. ...telling everyone that I stole his story. It was a story we both had discussed and conceived. How can it be his story alone? Let bygones be bygones. No! Bygones will not be bygones! If you mention his name here again.. 'I say you get out.' is what Sir will say! Actually when I think about it there is a point to it. It is sure that his story with his direction will be a hit! If you don't give him a date he would.. ...make the movie with someone else. And that hero will also become a star! Isn't that a loss to us? And then all producers will go after him. Wouldn't it be better if you gave him a date.. ...Instead of creating such a situation? Not only is it better it is the best way to get rid of him. He took away the Madhumati I used to dream about. Don't delay! Go and call Baby Kuttan where ever he is. You are five minutes late. Saroj Sir has gone to the swimming pool. Isn't he the director? - Yes. Why have you brought him here? Do you want to ruin Saroj Sir's mood? I have talked Saroj Sir into to this with great difficulty. Why should he go out of mood on seeing me? I have not betrayed him in any way for him to feel like that. What did you say? How dare you refer to the super star Saroj Kumar without respect? Aren't they friends who lived together sharing a room? That was then. Then many things could have happened. Super star Rajnikant used to be a bus conductor then. That doesn't mean that the conductors who worked.. ...with him then can come up to him and speak to him informally!! How will he act in a movie that I am going to direct.. ...If he is going to go out of mood on seeing me? Udhaya! Have we come here to argue? Mr. Pachalam, though he has is going to be the hero.. ...there has to be a certain rapport between the hero.. ...and the director to takes things ahead. If you don't use words rightly then.. ...things would only move backwards. I'll inform Saroj Sir. There he is. Do you remember all that I have said? Sit there. Greetings. Sit. Beautiful house. Is it an old house or did you buy it? Buy it! Huh! Every grass that you see there.. ...Is Saroj Sir's own idea. Isn't it now? In everything the aesthetic sense of an artist is obvious. This is no big deal. I just put it all together off hand. I am building a house on the beach. The floor and walls are made of Italian marble. But Italian marble is so expensive! All the furniture is from France. Chandeliers are from Thailand. Everything is so expensive! Everyone complains that super stars charge exorbitantly. But can the people who say so reduce the.. ...price of Italian marble and Scotch Whiskey? Saroj Sir has Royal Salute in the morning. Black Label in the afternoon. And Chivas Regal at night. Can I serve you a drink? - Not now. Hello. Yes. It is the minister. What news, Sir? I hope you haven't forgotten us wretched guys! Is it? When? I will be in Uzbekistan on that day? Isn't it? - When? And the next day I am leaving for Copenhagen. I am going as there as a guest of the state. If not in person do tell me if there.. ...Is something I can do for you, my dear. That's no big deal. You must improve the roads.. ...between Adimali and Munnar real fast. I need to use that road often. And I'll take care of that right away. Pachalam. - Sir. Send him a draft of 2 lakhs right away. He needs it for some orphanage. Don't you see great people take a lot of money.. ...but also have expenses of that kind to be met. Why don't people understand that? Shall I tell you a fact? I need 1.5 crore to get by 1 month with great difficulty. In some months it may go up to 2 crores. Which month is that? - April. That's what I was saying. Directors don't understand our problems. I don't want to waste time talking about our problems. Pachalam. - Sir. Call Oberoi hotel and order for lunch for two. What about you? - We'll have later. OK. Let us get to the point. My PA read the story you had sent. It would require many corrections. For example; the part that has me arrested by the police. That will not happen. I want to beat up the policemen who come to get me. I must beat them and make them fall on the ground. And then I will walk off in slow motion. There will be round of loud applause in the theater. How will the story progress if you are not arrested? Who says so? I'll tell you how it should be. After I bash up the policemen I walk away and.. ...head straight to the DGP's office hold out my hands.. ...and say.. 'Arrest me.' Isn't that heroism? My audience will not be able to bear it if some.. ...good for nothing policemen come and arrest me. This character is not inhuman to beat up policemen, is he? But isn't it me who will be acting the role? Don't I have to think about my image? That's all right. How many scenes do have in the movie? Could be around 51. In that case buy 51 cooling glasses. So that I can change them for each scene. But this character.. - Forget about the character. I am not intending a movie without a character. In that case find someone else to act for you. What is this Udhaya? This is only a discussion. Is there any need to take a stand? But it is for me. You haven't come to me to make a.. ...movie with me out of love for me, have you? You have come to me because I have the.. ...backing of lakhs of fans and you.. ...want to make money out of that. It is not because I have read books by Stanis Lowensky I hope you understand what I say? Mr. Saroj, we shall make this movie at any cost. We shall discuss everything and do accordingly. No, no! I'll say all that I want to while speaking. OK? If I must do this movie then, on my arrival at the set it.. ...won't work if I am called by the old name based on old memories. Everyone must refer to me as Sir. Sir. Get it? From here up to Kasarkode there.. ...must be some 50 fluxes of the movie. And only I should sing in it. My head and my full figure. My head and my full figure. Like that and like that and like that! 'Your head! Just come to act then we'll see.' 'Hey Stanis Lowensky! This is just the beginning.' 'You will learn about the rest soon.' if the shooting must begin on 17th then your art .. ...section must begin the work on the sets from the 1st. I have already booked for three rooms from the 1st. Will we be staying inside the studio? Sasi, Ramoji Rao film city is a place that has the.. ...facility to accommodate 10 or more film's crew at a time. There is no need to drive from.. ...Hyderabad to that place everyday. There are five stars hotels and ordinary hotels. Many vehicles for transportation. And enough stuff that you would need for shooting. There are 8 aides coming along with Saroj Kumar. Pachalam Basi, makeup men, two.. ...guys to hold the umbrellas and what not? I don't know how we are going to handle all of them. They are the kinds who are to be blamed for.. ...Malayalam cinema getting tarnished. Isn't it the kinds of you who tolerate.. ...his moods to capture the market? We don't have a choice, do we? I forgot something! Our hero's flight ticket is not confirmed. I'll go to the travel agent. In any case there is no need for me to see the sets. It would do just fine if you saw it. Thank you, Sir. How is the set? How is our set? - I didn't go there. Why? We must shoot for this movie in the MGR film city at Madras. What? - Only that will work. Please make all arrangements for that. Are you mad, Udhaya? All arrangements have been made here to begin.. ...the shooting the film on the day after tomorrow. Do you have any idea how much money I will lose because of that? What is the problem here? The problem is with me. A director's mind is his cinema. If his mind is not in it everything will be lost. Haven't I told you everything, baby Kuttan? It was for her sake that I renounced cinema too. And I went to work at a hotel. The woman who kicked me with her feet ruthlessly.. ...Is acting in some Telugu movie. - Here? How can I shoot my movie.. ...at a place where she is around? I don't get you. When I inquired I found that they will.. ...be shooting here for many more days. - So? Can't you understand my state of mind? I can't! We are investing lakhs of rupees to make a movie. There is no scope for a person with commitment.. ...to that movie to think of anything else. He shouldn't! What if we run into each other here? What if it causes an issue? Aren't you ashamed to talk like this? Are you not a professional? After being as assistant director for 10-12 years.. ...Is this all you have understood about cinema? Don't! Don't shoot! We can shoot after all personal issues are sorted out! Shall we cancel everything then? Let us shoot at MGR film city. No. What if Madhumati came there? Let us go to America then. What is she came there too? If a person decides to run he.. ...will have to run till the end of his life! Isn't she acting in cinemas forgetting about everything? You have to take it as a challenge! What issue will be created when you meet? It is for us to decide whether or not to make an issue of it. This is your first cinema. The shooting is to begin in a day. Don't think of anything else. This is the bouquet for the birthday celebrations. Did you buy it from Hyderabad? We bought the flowers and assembled it here. It is beautiful! - Thank you, Sir. Kneel down. Kneel down. Kneel down. Lower the camera a little bit. Udhaya, you better take a look at it. I can't get rid of the unnecessary.. ...objects in the background. It is right. - if people hang around it will obstruct the view. The frame is a little compact, isn't it? I haven't fixed it yet. Greetings, sir. - When did you arrive, Rafiq? This morning, by Hyderabad express. Come here. Did you address me as, sir? Do you want it to be like this between us? But you are a director on the sets.. There is no such rule. if you call me Sir I feel.. ...as if we both are distanced. That's why. Don't say that. No. I won't do so again. I am glad that you thought of me. When I was told to reach here to play a part.. ...In your production I felt like crying. Out of joy. It's been such a long time since I was looking for a role. This is the first time someone has called.. ...to tell me that there is a role for me. We'll talk after the shooting is over. Udhaya, do you know what the problem here is? None of the junior artists have a Malayalee look. How can you insist on a Malayalee.. ...look for people of Andhra? That is not a problem. Their faces won't be in focus. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Please don't take that car. We might need it here. Take the next one. I have the keys. Sit down. - No. Just sit down, will you? - I'll just stand by your side. If you don't sit in the chair next to me you might have.. ...to keep standing until the end of the shooting. Sit down. I heard about everything. What happened between you and Madhumati? We'll talk about all that later. - OK. Anyway I am very happy about Rajappan's rise. I am glad that you have joined up.. ...forgetting all the differences. Have you met him after he became a star? How could I? Do you know how eager I am to meet him? Though he betrayed you he did have to struggle a lot. But one thing is that even then he was very.. ...confident about himself and has.. ...reached his intended destination. Who knows what else he intends? Take the chair there. Pachalam. Yes. We are at the Ramoji Rao film city at Hyderabad. Director? He is a new person. Some Udhaya Banu. S gave him the date to save him. I can't say anything about that. If his direction is not all right.. Saroj Sir will take the first flight and.. ...get out of here you know about him, don't you? Didn't you say it was 200 acres of cashew plantation? Confirm the deal. I'll send the advance tomorrow. His word is final. Saroj Sir's Benz is arriving. I'll call you later. This is not Kerala, it is Hyderabad. There is no one to see you. There is no need for posing. Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Gayatri is looking very beautiful now. You didn't look so fair when you acted in.. ...the movie named Naatu Manga. Thank you, Sir. - Or have you applied extra make up? Greetings, Sir. I hope all the food items for Saroj sir's consumption.. ...during the shooting has been arranged? No one told me anything in particular about it, Sir. Who should anyone tell you that? The entire Malayalam film industry knows about it. Take it down. I will give you the printed Performa.. ...for the lunch and dinner requirements. This is besides that. Write it down. 30 tender coconuts. 20 Australian apples. Almond cake; I kilo. 10 packets of Cadburys biscuit. Plachimadai one bottle. - What is that? It comes from the place called Plachimadai. I forgot the name. I heard that it contains some toxic substances. Then I don't want that. Shall I make an extract of cashew.. ...nuts and sugarcane juice with milk? And some saffron to it too. - Yes. Saffron. Don't you eat saffron, Gayatri? - No, Sir. It is a very nice thing to improve the color of skin. Rajappa! - Have you told him about the cigarette? 10 packets John Players. - That is all for now. Rajappa, don't you recognise me. I am Rafiq. Oh God. It is time for me to get ready for my character. No one should come near me. Pachalam, fetch that guy who called me Rajappa. Do you want to talk to him? - I'll tell you. Why have you come here? - Udhaya has given me a role. Did Udhaya send you to insult me by.. ...calling me Rajappa in front of Gayatri? How would you get insulted if.. ...I called Rajappa by his name? It is an insult! It is the treason that my.. ...country parents did to me. Don't you know that now I am Saroj Kumar? If you don't behave yourself based on my.. ...status and worth I'll get you cut out of this movie. Do you Qet me!? Good morning. - Good morning. Shall we begin on an auspicious note? OK. What is the scene? Ramabhadran is Devi's father's friend. Who is Devi? Who is Ramabhadran? Gayatri will play the role of Devi. Ramabhadran.. That must be me. Then. Gayatri, give me the script. After Devi's father's death Ramabhadran brings.. ...Devi to his house since she has no one to turn to. Devi does not like Ramabhadran's behaviour.. ...on the train and she alights at a station on the way. After that scene, a month later Devi and.. ...Ramabhadran happen to run into each other by chance. That is the scene we will shoot now. Ramabhadran apologises for his behaviour of that day. Apologize? That too to a mere girl! I have not apologised to any one.. ...In any of my movies till date! Do you know that? Saroj Sir's fans will pull.. ...and tear the screen. Let her apologize to me for walking.. ...off the train without my permission. Yes. That is the right way. Change the scene and write the script. Mr. Saroj, we are making another scene where.. ...Devi asks for forgiveness for everything. Not just that. There is also a scene at the end where all.. ...the other characters apologize to you. OK. Then it is ok. Then both of them are standing and talking. Put a number 24 lens and put the camera on the crane. The camera is on the track and trolley. Whom did you ask before doing that? Sir fixes the camera in all his movies. I am directing this movie and I intended.. Why do you intend anything? The 3.5 crore people in Kerala.. ...come to watch my movie to see me. Who knows a director named Udhayabanu? Put the camera on the crane. ? The camera is on the crane all the while.. ...In two scenes before this one. That is why in this scene.. - Is it? Shouldn't you tell that first? Place the camera where ever you want. I am ready. Pachalam. Will the shot be all right if you.. ...didn't place the camera? Keep manipulating things like this with this man. If we keep arguing with him for everything.. ...then we will only have time for that. The shooting will never take place. Everybody get ready! Hi, Madhumati! What a pleasant surprise! How did you get here? Are you shooting for some movie? OK. OK I will come down. Please wait. Sir, what are you doing here? You still haven't forgotten to address me like that. I told you on the sets of the very first.. ...movie not to call me like that. There is so much formality in that word. You have been a star much before I became a super star. Crores of people admire me.. ...but I admire only Madhumati. Why don't you say such things to people.. ...who are fond in flattery, Sir? Madhumati, don't say such things. There is only one thing I have felt bad about. In your trusting Udhaya. When I found that you have rectified.. ...that mistake I was happy. I am not acting in his movie now because I like him. I want to teach him some lessons. Which movie are you talking about? In his movie. Hasn't he become famous because I gave him dates? The shooting for that movie is going on here. But for your sake I will settle scores with him. What was the reason behind your splitting? I have to go for a bath. OK. OK. We can talk in leisure. Come in please. What is the name of the movie released this.. ...Friday in which Jayakumar acts? Dosha Raghavan. - It is a super hit. Do something immediately. - OK. Talk to all my fans from Kasarkode to.. ...Thiruvananthapuram and ask at least 30 people to.. ...enter all theaters on all shows where Dosha.. ...Raghavan is playing and ask them to hoot cat calls.. ...as soon as the movie begins. We can't just let it be. For the time being one super star.. ...Is sufficient for Malayalam movies. That is right. I will make all arrangements. There are some tourists who have come from.. ...Kollam to the film city for sight seeing.. They know you are here. And are creating a ruckus outside to meet you. Please go and stand in the balcony. Not when I am not feeling too good! It doesn't look like they will leave. What can I do? Fans! Useless people! I don't get to live in peace even in Hyderabad. Fans are like grasshoppers. If we don't chase them.. ...away when they just begin harassing.. ...they might ruin the entire crop. I value your love for me more.. ...than a thousand awards. You have made me rise! It is the energy you give that flows through me. I was laid down, inflicted by typhoid. Your voices woke me. What is typhoid to me.. ...If I can't be available for you? Please allow me to take rest. We shall meet in Kerala. Good bye! OK! Bye, bye! See you! What is the name of the movie he is acting in now? 'In the rain that poured that day.' What is your name? - Pachalam Bhasi. I didn't know when I came here to shoot for a movie. When I came to know I pleaded with Baby Kuttan.. ...to shoot for the movie else where. He refused. He is the person who gave me.. ...a hand and steadied me when I was falling. He was the only person who showed affection.. ...and sympathy towards me when I was broken. I couldn't refuse him. I'm sorry. But if this is the time you come out to walk.. ...I'll change my timings. RM "You went even without talking or recognising me." "You never even replied to my greetings." 'You never even looked back once." "You vanished far away." "Dear, are you able to see the turmoil in me?" "Are you able to remember?" "That night which separated us." "I still remember that." "The night that we got separated." "You went even without talking or recognising me." "You never even replied to my greetings." RM "Once we met each other." "We searched for endless joy." "The life blossomed like the flower." "Our life became colorful." "ls our life also like the colours of the rainbow.." "..fading away, dearest?" "I still remember that." "The night that we got separated." "I still remember that." "The night that we got separated." "You went even without talking or recognising me." "You never even replied to my greetings." This way. Room number 122. - Thank you. Welcome. Madhu has lost so much weight, hasn't she? Whatever the matter might be we are siblings. I won't expect you to reciprocate.. ...the same feelings. But you can't tell me.. ...not to feel that way. Do you know how long we have been looking for you? We found out only yesterday that you are here. We got the flight that very moment to come here. We came at night and took a room in the hotel next door. Don't be scared. We haven't come for anything. I know that there is no use in talking about the past. But how many times had dad and I told you.. ...not to have anything to do with him? But you never listened to us. Anyway I am happy that you rectified your mistake. But when we found that he too has come.. ...to this film city we got worried. If he tried to harass you he should know that you.. ...are not an orphan and that there are people with you.. ...and he is accountable to us. I am late for the shooting already. Are you late for the shooting? Rafiq! What are you doing here? Udhaya gave me a role. Are you in a Telugu movie? Yes. - How long are you here? Maybe another 10 days. Are you fine? If you ask such a question.. When people we like are not fine how can I be fine? I would have been happy if you both.. ...were married and lived happily. That didn't happen. I don't know what happened between you two. I asked Udhaya about it once. He didn't say anything. But after a while I saw his eyes well up in tears. And I understood one thing that.. ...he is not the cause for your separation. I am getting late for the shooting. Udhaya is a nice man. Why did you hurt him like this? You won't understand if I said it. You will tell me in Malayalam won't you? I do understand a little bit of that language. Isn't it good to allow a man to live.. ...Independently if that is what he desires? Live independently? ls that what Udhaya said? Rain! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! Get him in the frame. The bus was late. The rain was not even. Let the kids board after he had gets off the bus. Start the propeller regularly. OK everybody back to position! Once more! Udhaya, I saw Madhumati. If you wanted to live alone why did you marry her? How can you talk about such.. ...things in the midst of shooting? Come on! Here we go! The train is at 1.30. We must start immediately. Cut it! How is it? - Excellent! 0k! You are talking about her in the middle of Rajappa's.. ...harassments and the anxiety of whether this will.. ...be completed before the releasing date. You know everything, don't you? Before marriage she used to ask me for advise.. ...on every little thing she wanted to do. But when there was a circumstance involving.. ...a decision about the two of us she.. ...took her independent decision. She left me alone and went away. But Madhumati.. - Don't Rafiq. I feel unwell as soon as I hear that name. Please. This film city is a great place. We looked around a bit. We have decided to stay for a few more days. Does it always get so late for the shooting to finish? Yes. On some days.. I told dad about having seen you. To tell you the truth, dad was crying over the phone. Whatever it may be you are his own daughter, aren't you? You are living in some far off place. But to think that he can't even get.. ...to see you, any father would feel sad. After all it is with your money.. ...that the house was built and the car was bought. It is all still there. We don't want anything. After you finish with this shooting you must come home. If we have wronged you due to our.. ...folly it won't happen again. And if one marriage didn't work out it doesn't mean.. ...that it should happen again. You should be living with a person who is well to do.. ...and loves you a lot and not.. Anyway forget it. Whatever you do hereafter should be.. ...done after thinking over nicely. I didn't separate myself from Udhaya because.. ...I wanted to marry someone else. Even though we don't live together everyone.. ...else in this world comes after Udhaya. It is because Madhumati is an innocent girl. Isn't that why she is falling in his trap? He is an immoral man. Even now he is after that girl who is.. ...acting as the heroine of his own movie. Is it? - Of course. I have known him for long. Do you think he married Madhumati.. ...because of his love for her? No. he wanted to make her act and churn out money. And when Madhumati refused.. ...to act after marriage he got rid of her. Anyway this is no big deal. Especially in cinemas. In Hindi cinema it is like having an ice-cream.. ...that people marry and separate. It is a little less in Malayalam. It should happen here too. I like you very much. I don't have a person to take.. ...care of my many businesses. My cinema production, estate, shopping complex etc. If you joined me we could be like one family. I am telling you frankly I was very fond of.. ...Madhumati from the beginning. I loved her during the days that we acted together. But he came in the midst of it all and ruined every thing. But still I love her. I really love her. RM "You're the most beautiful." "I'll never leave you." "Though you refuse to come to me." "I will never leave you in life."

"You're my girlfriend." When is the confrontation scene.. ...between Devi and Ramabhadran? We are planning that scene. Devi's jumping from the flat. All the required material should be ready on that day. All that will be ready but we have some new problems. There is a scene where Rafiq.. ...beats up Saroj below the flat. Now Saroj is not agreeing to it. - Reason? He says that his image will be affected.. ...If he is beaten by a junior artist. What does he expect? Should we change the story? He says that no actor from Malayalam cinema.. ...should beat him and that we should call for Amrish Puri from Hindi movies! My foot! Why should we call Amrish Puri.. ...let us get Amitabh Bachchan! I never expected this guy to be such a pest! The releasing date is fixed and.. ...agreements with theaters have been signed. And now he wants us to call Amrish Puri to beat him up! If Amrish Puri knows of this he will.. ...send men from Bombay to beat him up! Hello Mr. Baby Kuttan. - Hello. I know you are busy with your work but I need.. ...to talk to Mr. Udhaya for just a minute. What is it regarding? - It won't take even a minute. If you could come out.. I have nothing to talk to you about. I am making a movie for the first time.. ...and now I only have that on my mind. Oh no! I haven't come here to worry you. I want to inform you about something that will.. ...make you happy and I'll leave. That's it. What would make me happy and.. Don't waste time arguing, Udhaya. What is it? - I don't want to blame you or Madhumati. At that time we were very upset but leave that alone. That is over. You both have separated. Since the marriage was registered it should also be.. ...nullified in the right manner. Otherwise it may cause trouble.. ...for you or Madhumati in future. If it is a combined petition it would make things easy. If you just signed in this I'll file it in the court. It can be done. It has to be done, isn't it? But even if Madhumati alone signed and filed.. ...the petition the court will accept it It will but if it is a combined petition.. No. I am not interested in any combined venture. And at the moment I don't have much time to talk. Do you need so much time to give one signature? Mister, there is no point in saying.. ...the same thing many times. Please set for the shot. - OK, Sir Reji set for that shot. - Yes, sir. If your cinema is important to you then my.. ...sister's life is more important to me. When she was setting Malayalam movies ablaze.. ...you came like Satan and ruined her life. Luckily she has started acting again. Kumar has agreed to marry her. That is why I wanted this divorce immediately. I asked you to sign this. I don't want to sign it! Is the shooting site the right place to talk about.. ...divorce and other nonsensical things? I just thought of asking you politely. It is not as if I don't know of other ways.. ...to get you to do it. - What the hell.. - Udhaya, please! Mr. Dineshan, we'll work things out. I'm assuring you. Let us first finish with this movie. No Baby Kuttan, this man.. - Please come. Come with me. Please don't mind my saying this. How ever much animosity there is it is not right to.. ...torture a person like this under such circumstances. As a creative artist you should have known it. I'm not saying this as the producer.. ...of Udhaya's film but as his well wisher. Please don't trouble him anymore. Sending your brother in the middle of the shooting of a.. ...movie and saying that you want a.. ...divorce is not the right way. Don't do this again. Please. It is a request. When all the help you gave me crossed limits.. ...I had to leave the house. If you help me any further I might have.. ...to look for other ways. When I feel affectionate for you I'll come home and.. ...see you all. Until then there is no need for you all.. ...to go out of the way to show me your love. Get it? Saroj Sir, you need not know anything else. You only have to invest the money and leave the rest to us. If the date is fixed for 1st of March that day the.. ...'Parotta and Papad' would have been exported to Gulf. Why only to gulf? Why not to Europe or America? Are we going to export raw ones or fried ones? Don't try to talk smartly, Mr. Pacholam! It is Pachalam. - Yes, Pachalam. Won't the people in the airport bang it and crush it? Mr. Saroj, there is a small shot below the flat, if it is.. ...not shot now the flat scene cannot be completed. All are waiting for you. We are discussing something.. ...more important than that. We are going to export 'Parotta and Papad.' They are my business partners. Valsan Kondoti. - Greetings. Benz Mathew. - Greetings. - Hello! Kuriachan Thuttipara. - Greetings. So will both the factories be on the same building? No! That will be a mistake. If the plain flour meant for Parotta and the.. ...black gram flour meant for Papad get.. ...mixed then everything will get mushy and sticky! How many Malayalees would there be in the Gulf? I don't know exactly but not less that 10-25 lakhs. If the packets have my photo on it.. ...all Malayalees would buy them, won't they? What is the doubt about it? When it is super star.. ...Saroj Kumar's Parotta.. ...then each gulf Malayalee would eat 2 Parottas in a day. That would need at least 50 lakh Parottas in a day. Would be able to make so many in our factory? We must take that shot while there is light. They have come to click a photo of.. ...mine while eating Parotta to print on the packet. I'll come after that. Shall we click the photo? - OK. It doesn't look like he will come here right away. That man and Pachalam are up to clicking snaps and.. ...discussing something with some business partners. He and his stupid Parotta and Papad business! The day light will be gone in half an hour. We have to release the movie on 19th. What's the point if he doesn't come on being called? He doesn't seem to know that the.. ...earth below his feet is slipping away. Both his movies released last week have flopped. There is no end to his acting smart. Let us do one thing, Udhaya. We'll shoot the scene where Rafiq beats him later. Gayatri's dates are getting exhausted. Let us shoot the scene inside the flat first. Reji, location shift. I realise that you were after Bala's.. ...death from behind the curtain. Now everything is clear to me. I have informed the police station that a man is.. ...trying to harm me. She falls down crying. My Bala loved me so much. Devi in rage. You are a lowly creature. I don't want this world where you live! I don't want this world without Bala. After saying this Devi jumps down. This is the scene. Sir, are you a villain in the movie as a character.. ...who kills her husband and tries to acquire a woman? Ladies audience will spit on your face if they saw this scene. How did this happen? My PA didn't tell me about this. This was not the story he read to me. To have a woman call super star.. ...Saroj Kumar a lowly creature.. I gave the script to read it. It is not my mistake if you didn't read it. You can't pin your opinion about the character by.. ...seeing one scene and not knowing the story. Is this a new scene you created to harm my image? If it is so then I'll learn about the entire story and.. ...then act in the rest of the movie. Come to my room with the full screen play. Come in! Read it from the beginning. Let me hear it. I have reservations about reading it.. ...In front of people who are not related to movies. Who told you that they are not? In fact I called them here so that they can correct the.. ...story such that my character gets highlighted. They are the people who corrected all my hit movies. Why do you just get them to correct it? Why don't you get them to write all your stories? How can you refer to him with disrespect? Who the hell are you to address out super star.. ...In such a derogatory manner? I'll come back later. I am not very particular about your coming back. I will only act after I get them to correct the story.. ...and write it in such a way that it doesn't harm me. I have created this with great thought.. ...and over many sleepless nights. I won't allow just any passer-by to correct it. Who are passers-by? Friend, I don't even know who you are. Why should we both be arguing? This is only your first movie. If we should be correcting your story you should.. ...already be a proven director. I have told you once that I am not for arguments. I have been struggling for years to make one movie. I have gone through enough. Don't you dare harass me any more! Are you threatening us? You better.. Don't! Don't! Hey you! I have tolerated a whole lot. I can't bear with it anymore. If you try to ruin this movie I'll cut you to pieces. Rascal! What happened? Haven't you started yet? How do we begin? All the artists have been waiting since 8 o'clock with make-up. How can we without the super star? Vijay Varkala who went looking for him too hasn't returned yet. Oh God! Don't we have another 4-5 scenes to complete! Baby Kuttan, please go over and make him.. ...understand that if we delay anymore everything will go haywire. Sir! I waited for a long time. Then I called the room. There was no response. Then I inquired at the reception. They said that he left last night. He has written this letter to be given to you. Egoist!- 'No one is big enough to play games with Super stars!' 'My name will remain at least by virtue of the movies that I have acted in.' 'But you! You will die a death of hell for not being.. ...able to release your very first movie and will not attain any fame or recognition.' 'Good bye, Udhayabanu, good bye!' There is no point in wasting time thinking about it. If I knew where he is I will go and meet him. I'll fall at his feet. There is no way out. I will not allow that! Even if it means that I will.. ...be on the streets I will not allow you to plead to a rascal like him. What else can we do? Look who it is? I want to tell him something. Let us all sit in Sasi's room. The shooting is over. We are leaving. She asked if she could see you. I'll come. I'll come now. Have you come to inform me about your wedding? Or have you come to seek comfort by seeing me totally ruined? The movie has wound up. I am also going back foregoing my dreams.. ...and desires of many years midway. Don't worry. I will make arrangements for divorce at the earliest. I didn't send brother Dinesh. I couldn't bear it when you put away all your desires.. ...of making movies and working at a hotel. It happened because of me. Did you think it was because I don't love you? Who else do I have in this world to love but you? Come Udhaya. Did you get any idea? I have something to explain in detail. I have re-written the story. Don't be worried. I think it is better than the earlier movie. We have to release this movie even if an actor.. Kumar was dead. When that thought crossed my mind I got this idea. There is one shot and three sequences where we can't do without him. We shall shoot them with him. One is a shot where Rafiq beats him. Then the scene where he comes to the flat to see Devi. Then Devi jumps down. After that the scene where the police arrest him. We had put away those scenes because he refused them. Then he becomes psychic out of fear. How will get him to do all this? I tried to send many people to talk him into it. But.. Don't I know that it won't work with his consent? How then? - I have prepared the plan for it. We will need a huge infrastructure to achieve it. Minimum four cameras. Facility to light up a whole floor. Udhaya, I will do all that you want. But will we be able to release the movie on 19th? Don't ask me for an assurance like that. He has come here to shoot for a movie. If things go the way I have planned.. We will try our best. And thus we lost the last hope we had. The boat jetty that was expected to be a super hit has broken. No one calls. And no one asks for dates. I fear that I will have to go to the streets again. Sacks full of Parotta and Papad meant for export are lying in Kozhikode. If this continues we just might have to live the.. ...rest of our lives eating those Parottas and Papads. Rajappan is not the kind to give up so easily. I also know to make a movie directed, produced and acted by me. Of all the things you just said, forget about directing. It is something only intelligent people can do. And producing? Even if one movie of your flopped you have.. ...only enough wealth to make you bankrupt. You have lost the rest in your business and waywardness. God! Let it be some producer. Hello! This is super star Saroj Kumar here. Sir, this is actress Gayatri calling. Gayatri! Where are you calling from? I am calling from my flat. I wanted to tell you something important. Do you know Madhumati who was Udhaya Sir's wife? She is with me now. She wants to discuss something with you. Could you come over here please? - Sure. I don't think that you will change because of what I.. ...do or that you will learn some lessons in life. But it is a must for the peace of my mind. Cut it. When Rajappa arrives give him.. ...a tight slap across his face! Set the camera there. - OK. Udhaya, are you sure he will come? He has assured Gayatri that he will come. Camera 1? - Yes, Sir. Camera 2? - Sir? - Are you ready? Start when I tell you. OK? Get ready. - OK, sir. Rafiq, if he doesn't stop on being called catch hold.. ...of him and pull him such that he faces the camera and hit him. He will not come dressed. That is all right. We should be able to shoot his face with the same dress. Rafiq! Rajappa? - What are you doing here? What are you doing here? - I am going to see a friend. Good. You won't act in Udhaya's film, is it? Cut it. Anbazhagan. He is here. Start the camera when he knocks at the door of the flat. OK? - OK. What about the dialogues between Gayatri and Rajappa? Dialogues are not a problem. What ever he says we will make someone with the.. ...same voice as his to dub the dialogues. We only need to get his reactions correct. Yes? - He has knocked at the door. OK. Gayatri, open the door. Hello. - Please come in, Sir. Please sit down, Sir. - Thank you. Before Madhumati arrives I have a few things to tell you. What is it? - Two weeks ago my husband died. You may not have noticed it in the papers. Oh my God! Your husband died? I didn't even know that you were married. Many people don't know. It was a suicide. His name was Balakrishnan. He was a financier. Everything was smooth for sometime. Someone played truant from behind. All the depositors asked him for money at the same time. Camera one and two get ready. - That is why. Net, junior artist, everything get ready. I have informed the police that.. ...someone is trying to harm me. My Bala loved me so much. You are a lowly creature! I don't want this world where you live. I don't want this world without Bala. This dialogue.. Gayatri, I think you have got it wrong. I am super star Saroj. Hey! Yes! We got it! Steady cam! Camera 3 and 4 police! Everything, get ready. We are ready. Security! Please close the gate. Cut it. OK move! Camera 3 and 4. Bikes. Get down! - What? I am innocent! I have not done anything. She called me there. Cut it! - Great Udhaya. There is a problem. Rajappa in the custody of our dummy police. If Pachalam Bhasi gives a complaint.. ...to the real police then we will be in trouble. So we must take the shots where he.. ...becomes psychic as soon as possible. Tell me what is the plan? We have to get him to the set that we have created.. ...with the continuity dress exactly at 70' clock. And beat him. But shouldn't he be acting like a psychic? No need. We have planned it in such a way that he will become like that in reality. If everything goes well he will tremble shiver in fear and scream and run. We will shoot it from all angles with the cameras. Call our men and ask them to get him there at 7. Cut it! Hey Rajappa! I made a few changes and completed my movie. The real criminals of Malayalam cinema are stupid conceited people like you. Cinema is made with the sweat and blood of many people. I won't allow you to ruin it. I am releasing this movie on the 19th of this month. And after that I will see to you properly! And then I will settle all scores. Hello. By the time I finished getting prints here I was.. ...late and there was no flight or train to reach on time.. It was real mess. I had doubts if we could begin the noon show. Is MD in his seat? - He has gone to Coimbatore. How is the response? - Average. The last few movies of Saroj Kumar were flops. Not only that, the director is a new guy. But Udhayabanu is a talented man. But people don't know that, do they? But the cinema can only be saved if.. ...new talented people came in. Theater owners will give maximum support if the movie is good. What about advance reservation? - Not too good. Don't make that an issue. After the matinee the people will decide. Yes. Everything is in the hands of God. And Saroj Kumar has called that he will come for this show. Is it? - Yes. Has director Udhaya Banu come? - No. Udhaya, we are at the theater. You said you will be here? Yes. But I am very tense, Baby Kuttan. I don't know how the public will receive me. Anyway we will know the fate with the matinee show. What is the point of being scared? But... - No ifs and buts. You must come here. Kumar has reserved a seat to watch the movie. Is it? Won't that be a problem? Won't the people be diverted from the movie on seeing him? If the movie is interesting people won't pay attention to him. Do one thing. Drive my car and come here right away. No. Don't say anything. Greetings. This way. I haven't told Udhaya that I have asked you to come and watch the movie. Will it be full by the time it begins? Pray to God. We have done good publicity. But it a rat race. Let us go upstairs. No. Let us sit down here. The train is at 1.30 we must start right away. When shot without knowledge it turns out so well. This is the way to act. He has brains. Do you understand? You have created a stir! We have got the fruits of our toil. You have given a great performance. Should we consider it your comeback? It is not about going or coming back. My first entry was made by stealing the story of the director of this movie. It is intelligent filmmakers who create stars. Udhaya is the star. Not me. Move away. Move away. Forgive me for everything.
