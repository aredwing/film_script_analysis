We just want what's underneath that tarpaulin. I think our cattle are over the ridge. I can hear them. How'd they get over here? Come on, Pop. Let's go for them. Let's let the dust settle first, son. Ben. Tell him to stay there. Stay where you are! - What do you want? - I want my cattle back! - He'll get them in 5 minutes. - You'll get them in 5 minutes! You gonna let them do this to you? Not much else I can do. Don't anybody move! If you move, I'll kill him. Lift him up easy. Put him on his horse. Aren't you gonna do something? What, and get myself shot too? That must be Ben Wade and his gang. What's his name? Bill Moons. - Where does he live? - He used to live in Contention City. Take him there. Can't. My passengers are due in Bisbee, only a few miles away. Take him to Bisbee and put him on the next coach back. Where a man lives is where he should be buried. - We'll need those horses. - Why? So you don't ride to the marshal. Get off. All right, boys. Get off. We'll turn them loose this side of Bisbee. - You wait! My pa will kill you! - Mark. Let's get the cattle. Hello there! Could you help us? - I gotta get the cattle home! - Could you lend us a horse? Yeah, I'll bring one back! What happened? Where are your horses? The coach was held up. They saw us, Ma, and took them. And killed the driver! They killed the driver? One of their fellows was on top, taking off these bags... ...and the driver grabs him as a shield. Do they care? No, they shoot through him. It was Ben Wade. Ben Wade? What did you do? There were 12. What could I do? - We stood still. - Then they took our horses. We just watched. What else could we do? You want us to get shot? Boys! Go saddle a couple of horses. I ought to take them some water too, I guess. I'm glad you're safe. Anything could have happened. There was no danger, not to us anyway. - It just seems so terrible. - Why? What's terrible? - Nothing. - What's the matter? Nothing. It's terrible that bad things happen, and all we do is stand by and watch. Lots of things happen where you can only stand by and watch. I know, but to have you stand by and to have the boys watching... That's life. You have to watch a lot of terrible things. People get killed. Lightning can kill you. Three years of drought killing my cattle is terrible. But I can't make it rain. Expect me to cool off the sun? Dan, why are you so cross? You expect something from me that I'm not. No, I don't. Not really. I can't go chasing after outlaws, my cattle dying all over. - Lf they die, don't know what I'll do. - I'll hold it. Ten years of sweating. You think I want to lose this place? - Cattle's not dying at Parker's ranch. - No, of course not. He's got a stream that don't run dry. Have you asked him to let you use it? What good? Six months' water right costs $200. Where will I get that? Oh, Dan, you have to do something. You can't just stand by and watch. You work so hard, I work so hard and the boys... Maybe it'll rain. What if you borrowed the money in town? - You know I hate to beg from people. - Borrowing isn't begging. It could save us. I suppose I could try. - You gonna look for the horses? - I'm going to Bisbee first. I'll look on the way back. That loan would take care of six months. By then it's bound to rain. All this will be green in six months. The cattle will be fat, and the boys... Maybe you and me won't be so tired all the time. In six months we'll be happy, won't we? Sure, we'll be happy. To the boss. He had to say goodbye to one of us and that's too bad. But if it wasn't goodbye for him, it could've been for some of us. Boss? - Is the marshal around? - In the office. You tell him the coach from Contention was held up. We passed it on the way in. They don't have horses. - Did you hear what I said? - Yeah, I heard. - Why don't you go tell him? - He naps between 1 and 2. He does? That's nice. That way he don't get tired. You fellows come from the North? Down here everybody naps between 1 and 2. Everybody except you. The boss is napping now. I take mine between 2 and 3. I guess we've come too early. - Does this place keep your boss busy? - No, he does other things. Like what? He has a bank and loans money to ranchers. Does he keep the money here? He doesn't have money. With the drought, nobody pays back. That's too bad. Miss, if my outfit's asking too many questions, you just say so. We've been driving cattle, and when you come to a place like this... ...and you see a nice girl like you... Well, it's nice. How far's the Mexican border? Nobody knows exactly. It's never been decided. I think we can find it all right. When the marshal wakes up, tell him the coach was robbed. And tell him the driver was killed. Killed? Killed. If there's killing, I'm to wake him. It's only robbery he don't want to be waked for. Marshal! The coach was robbed and Bill Moons killed. Marshal, these fellows outside seen it! How far back was it? - About 10 miles. - They took the horses too. Did you hear that, marshal? - Why didn't you try and help? - We were strung out. - We didn't see it till we looked back. - Right. Go get everybody. Where are you fellows from? Prairie Cattle Company. - Didn't know they got this far. - They bought 60,000 in Mexico. - They sent us to drive them in. - You won't be staying? No, just long enough to have a drink. Alex Potter! I told you he had rheumatism! Anyway, he sold his horse. He can use one of my horses! Suspicious old goat. - Where's Alex Potter? - Sleeping it off. I don't think he wants to leave town with us here. Scatter across the border. We'll meet in Nogales tonight. - What's holding up the boss? - Don't worry, he'll be along. He can handle that hick posse single-handed. Come on. Didn't I see you some place? Did you? Yeah, did you ever...? Did you ever work in Cheyenne? - El Paso? - No. Did you ever work in the Blind Irishman in Dodge City? Yeah, I sang there. Best time I ever had in my life. What made you quit? I got to coughing too much. Doctor said I should breathe dry air. You sure come to the right place here. I spent more money in that place... Did you remember a girl, her name was... ...Pauline? - A heavyset girl. - And Velvet? Remember her? I spent 300 in one night on her. Remember, they had real Paris dresses there. Real Paris perfume. You have to treat a woman right. I'd have spent every cent on her except she married the governor. Many young fellows around this place? No, they're all older. You must get lonely. Hey! Where are they? Where'd they go? Alex! That way. - Ain't you gonna help catch him? - Wish I could. - How'd they look? - It'll be easy. Three big men on three white horses. Three white fellas on three big horses, huh? - Ever sing anymore? - Who's there to sing for? You know, you look kind of skinny. I feel skinny. I don't mind a skinny girl. Just so she has blue eyes to make up for it. You got blue eyes? Brown. It's all right. They don't have to be blue. Must be they buried their man here. If I had my way, there'd be more than one. Hello, you the marshal? You see the Butterfield coach? - This is Mr. Butterfield. - They got a gold shipment. - See where they went? - Bisbee. We just come from Bisbee. Didn't you see an outfit? Must have been 12, all on dark horses. You didn't see them? Yeah, we seen them. Then they left. Cy, you'd better go along, hitch up the coach down there. - We think it was Ben Wade. - What do you know? There I was, face to face with Ben Wade. Hi, marshal. Did you catch them yet? - Them were the fellas back in Bisbee. - Yeah? One of them is still there. He went into the saloon. You been drinking this morning or not? I never touch a drop until noon. - There's a man there. Let's catch him. - What if it's Ben Wade? - What good is catching him? - We'll arrest him. Till his outfit comes back and shoots up the town? - No one's held him yet. - We'll get him out of town. We won't catch him standing here. Let's go. - Are you coming, Dan? - Yeah, I'm coming. What will happen is somebody will get hurt bad. - Think you'll ever get back to Bisbee? - Don't look like it. - That's what I figured. - I never stay long anyplace. Do you care? Sure, I care. What can I do? You're on the go, and I'm stuck. I ain't complaining. I got something to remember. Me too. Funny, some men you can see every day for 10 years... ...and you never notice. Some men you see once and they're with you the rest of your life. - What happened? - Finishing my drink. There's a fella coming down the road. Hello, Mr. Evans. You want something, Mr. Evans? - Something I can do to help you? - You drove off my cattle. - You got them back. - Yes, it took me a half day. What's half a day worth? When I hire out a full day, I get two dollars. - Here's two dollars for half a day. - Then that's what I'll settle for. - There's two more for you. - What for? For your boys. I used their time too. If you don't mind, you owe me two more for tiring out my cattle. Two more for tired cattle. Is there anything else you wanna get paid for? You can give me two dollars extra for making me nervous. Don't move. It's the marshal. He's got a shotgun on you, Wade. Put your hands up. Ben? - Watch him. - I'll watch him. Now what good is all that? He'll come back with the others... ...and I'll go free. And you'll get shot. We'll get you out of town so fast you won't touch ground. Over here. Sit down, there. Here, take this. I helped out this far. I'm finished. - You're what? - Finished. I come here on business. - I got to take care of my cattle. - You're our best shot. - That's not my job. I'm no deputy. - You are now. Every man is a deputy. I was coming to see Mac. I don't mind helping, but that's all. I can't spare time. I'll lose everything. That won't make any difference. Mac, you watch him. - Can I talk to you a minute, Mac? - What's it about, Dan? Well, it's a business thing, you know. Sit down. Thanks. The faster we get him out, the safer. That's right. We'll outsmart them every step. We only got two, three hours head start. They'll think we'll turn him in at Fort Huachuca. Sure, they will. - Or they'll think we'll go to Benson. - That's a fact. Or they'll think we'll take him over to Contention... ...put him on the 3:10 to Yuma. - Sure, they're bound to. Alex, will you let me finish? Then you can agree. Sure. When the coach comes, we'll put him on it and start. - Start where? - That's where we fool them. Look... ...here's Benson. Here's Contention. And here's Fort Huachuca. It'd only be for six months. It'll rain by then. Rain? Sure, everybody would prosper. - I only need 200. - Lf you were my own brother... ...I still couldn't help you. I guess I'd better be getting back home. - How's the missus? - She's fine, thanks. - Good. How're the boys? - Fine. They're fine. I need two volunteers. Do I have two volunteers? - For what? - I'm not telling you for what. Two will go with Dave Keene. We'll follow with the prisoner. - Who'll volunteer? - We gotta know what to expect. - Sure, might not be safe. - Safe. Who knows what's safe? A man died from looking at his wife. My grandma fought the Indians for 60 years, then choked to death on pie. - Do I have two volunteers? - I'll pay $200 to each man. - I'll volunteer. - You said you couldn't... - Do you want me or don't you? - Sure, we do. Here, take this shotgun. - Now, do I have another? - I'll go. Wait a minute, Alex. No offense... ...I just think it'd be safer if we had somebody else. Come on, give me a chance. Anybody else? Dave, you have your two men: Alex Potter and Dan Evans. - Where are we going? - Here's the plan. We're gonna transfer him at your house. - My house? - It'll only take a minute. - Everybody, out. We need the coach. - You'll have to stay here tonight. - Get another team, a four-up. - Get Bill Moons out. There's a coach to Contention tonight, I'll send him over in that. Lively, now. Lively, everybody. Get up! Come on. You mean to say I have this all to myself? Well, that's very thoughtful of you. Bye, Emmy. Goodbye. Tell you what, I'll send you something. Would you like pearls? I'll send you some. - Then maybe you won't forget. - I won't forget. I seen 'em. You know what to do. We're coming to it. I'll try. - All right, let's get him down. - All right. - Hello, can you give us a hand? - Get ready, come on. Heave! All right, get out! Heave! It worked. Those two will round up the rest and chase the coach. There. Supper's ready. Take this out to Mr. Potter. You're welcome to share what we have. - Here's your stew, Mr. Potter. - Thanks, Matthew. - Know where your pa keeps a drink? - No, I don't. - Don't you know where he keeps a jug? - No. - You don't mind my asking, do you? - No, Pa said you would. We always wait for Mother to start. And we don't teach others manners. You didn't say grace. She always says grace. - She comes from San Francisco. - Mark. Her father was a sea captain. He owned a ship. Two ships. Eat your supper. - Lf he was here, he'd shoot you dead. - Dead as a skunk. - That's enough. - Lf he wants, my pa can shoot you too. - He can shoot anything. - He can shoot a cougar a mile away. Go ahead now and eat your supper. - It's good stew, ma'am. - Thank you. You didn't say grace because he's bad? I simply forgot. - Can't you say grace with bad people? - Grace is for everybody, dear. Then why don't you say it? Dear Lord, we thank thee for life and for food. We ask thee to give us the wisdom that comes with silence. Amen. I didn't close my eyes once. I just squinted, because you could run away. Why would I want to run away? This is real nice. - Would you like me to cut your meat? - Yeah, would you, please? Thank you. Would you mind cutting the fat off? I don't like fat. - What was it? - Me. I thought I saw something moving there. They could've heard that. Guess I got spooky. I was in San Francisco once. I knew a girl there. She was a sea captain's daughter too. And she had the greenest eyes. I used to look deep into her eyes and they'd just change colors... ...get all fiery and green. All the colors of the sea. Funny how a woman's eyes will change color at nighttime. Alice. You go inside, Alex, and don't take your eyes off him. What was Alex shooting at? Why did you have to sit there listening to him? - What do you mean? - All big-eyed and listening to him. Something's moving down there. They don't know he's here, do they? No, they think he's in the coach. That's how we planned it. Matthew, Mark. - Yes? - Get the horses. - Which ones? - They're saddled. What happens when they catch the coach? They'll have to round their men up, so they won't catch up to it till noon. They'll find out. By then we'll be in Contention, and they can't get there in time anyway. Alex, turn down the lamp, and when the horses come, bring him out. Don't worry. This is safer than being with the coach. - The boys are so proud. - What? Proud of you. Their own father capturing Ben Wade. - Didn't you see them looking at you? - No, all I saw was Wade. And I'm proud too. Put him on the middle horse. Alex, you lead. I'm obliged for your hospitality. I appreciate it, and your husband too. I hope I can send him back to you all right. What did he mean, he'll send him back all right? He was just talking. - Do you think anything will happen? - Sure. He'll come back with $200. $200 is a lot. Not if he doesn't come back, it isn't. - What's wrong? - Can I see my wife from here? - No, you couldn't possibly. - Maybe that's why I feel so good. You mind telling me where we're going? We're going to Contention City. We'll wait there. When the 3:10 comes in, we'll put you on it. Thanks. Now, if we get separated, I'll know where to wait for you. Walk your horses. We don't want to wake up the town. - Is that the house? - It was, but the man's afraid. Afraid of what? The only thing I could arrange was a room at the hotel. Well, at least we got this far. - I'll go on across for a look. - We'll meet at the rear of the hotel. Step down easy, Wade. We're ready for you, the bridal suite. - Anyone in the lobby? - One guy sleeping it off. Make sure no one knows we're here. Alex, keep a watch at the town's edge. What could happen? Why don't you relax? I'm practically on the train. - Is that the drunk? - Yeah. It's the front room upstairs. The key's in the door. Cover downstairs. Alex'll come if he sees anything. You give me great confidence. It's not 3:10 yet. Sit down on the bed if you want. You must be... ...very tired by now. Why don't you sit and have a little sleep? I'll hold the shotgun for you if you like. No? I don't have anything against you personally. I'm doing it for the money. - I know. - But understand one thing: If you start across... ...this eight feet between us... ...l'll pull both triggers at once. This is the bridal suite? I wonder how many brides... Is it a little hot in here? You notice it? Kind of warm. You mind if I open that window? Think you can reach it from where you are? It's too far. I'll open it. - Want me to give you a hand? - Sit back. Go ahead. You don't take any chances, do you? Where's your sporting blood? Back home with my wife and boys. They usually leave a stick around. You can prop it open. They usually stand it in a corner somewhere. See it? Right over there. Right there. Feel better now? I had to try you out. I didn't think you'd shoot. You know I will the next time. Do I? See anything? Not for miles. - Quiet here? - Like a tomb. Did you come in for a drink? First time I can remember, I don't want one. Scared? Which room is he in? Second floor in front. Don't think I'm too scared of Wade's gang to do what's necessary. Tell Dan he can count on Alex Potter right to the end. I'm gonna ride on back and keep watch. - How long has he been there? - I only know, when he come in... ...he asked me if I'd seen a big woman in a purple hat. - Sure is some sleeper. - He sure is. How much money do you make? Not very much. - You figure that's your business? - Yes, I do. How do you figure? You must need money bad to do this. - Maybe I do. - How much they paying you? - $200. - $200? That's a lot of money. How'd you like to double that and save yourself time and trouble? How do you reckon I'll do that? Drop that gun and let me walk out. It's worth $400 to me. Kind of reckless of you. Especially since you're sure your men are coming for you. Oh, they are. Yes, they're coming. Only, I like to do things real easy. Real peaceful. You want to look out at a peaceful scene? You might recognize somebody. That's Mrs. Moons in front. The young man... ...that's his son, Bob. She had another son. He was the stagecoach driver, Bill Moons. He used to drive the coach. Remember him? Yes, seems to me I do. A hotheaded fellow, wasn't he? Not reasonable, like you. I sure am, friend. I'm so reasonable I'll let you walk right out of here. Only thing is, it'll be at 3:10, and I'll be behind you with a shotgun. I can tell you're a very intelligent man... ...and I wouldn't want to try to corrupt your morals. Mighty nice of you. Know something? I think I know what's bothering you. I wouldn't dream of suggesting... ...you let a murderer walk out free. But you see, Bill Moons drew first. That makes it self-defense, doesn't it? I don't go around just shooting people down. That isn't nice. I work quiet... ...like you. All right, so you're quiet like me. Well, then shut up like me. - Hey, is that the right time? - Yes, sir. - Why didn't you wake me? - You didn't ask me to. - Anybody come in lately? - You mean, to engage a room? - Yeah, any strangers come in town? - Not since you went to sleep. - Might as well go. She won't come. - Who were you planning to meet? My wife. She ran off with a traveling man. I figured he'd bring her here. What do you know? Mine ran off too. I wonder why they do that. I don't know. I always treated mine all right, never hit her too hard. I'm gonna go outside and wait. If she don't come soon, I'm gonna go. Sure would like to get my hands on her. Thank you. Three years' drought ain't bad. At one time they had 10 years of drought right around here. A big outfit, they got nothing to worry about with drought. They got all the water they need. With a little money, you can get almost anything. Maybe so. Cowpokes like us just don't belong in that kind of a business. Trying to make a go. Killing ourselves. Trying to make a go of it alone. Got to have money behind you. Ever think of taking on a partner? I work alone. A silent partner, with money. Say... ...$ 7000. - You think that's my price? - Just think... ...with $ 7000 you can do everything you've ever dreamed of. Think it over. Nobody needs to know. Maybe you come higher? Maybe. All right. When you decide, let me know. I'll let you know. What'll it be? Anybody want whiskey? - Everything go all right? - All right. - You couldn't wait for the preacher. - George prayed. Prayed real good too. Sorry more people weren't there to hear it. Things come to a pass when the boss can't go to a man's funeral. Really, I can explain. Especially when the laborer was protecting the employer. God rest his soul. As for your soul... ...you'll have neither cooler nor hotter place than this. If I can do anything to help you decide, let me know. - How can I trust you? - About the $ 7000? Yeah, how do I know I'll get it? Because it'll be 10. - 10? - See, that makes it easier for me. I count by 10s. Do me a favor, will you? Don't talk to me for a while. Sure. Of course, you know... ...it would be easier if we could get it settled. You shut up. Now you just sit there and shut up. - You mean, we're not together? - We're not even close. At about five minutes to 3... ...we'll be a lot closer than you think. - Who is it? - Butterfield. - What do you want? - I've got coffee for you. Leave that shotgun where it is! He found out and pulled a gun. He's been drinking. Going to Yuma on the 3:10? I'll save everybody a long ride. That fair, Wade? - Shoot and you'll hang for murder. - Stay or I'll shoot you. - Hand me that gun. - Get out of the way! Hand me that gun or I'll push you through that wall. You're pretty good. What if somebody heard that shot? Don't you go blaming yourself because it isn't your fault. You'd have seen the same thing in Benson... ...or Huachuca. No matter where you take me... ...somebody would be riding for help right now. When one of us is caught, we figure the places where they'd take us. Then we send one man to each of those places... ...to wait. And watch. I wouldn't worry too much, though. He might not be back in time. He won't. He can't possibly. What'll we do? We can't just wait. If I were you, I'd get some help. Just in case. Moons, are you going to run? Or will you help Dan put me on the train? Butterfield isn't. I am. I give you my word. I'll walk with you every step of the way. We'll see. We'll see. I seen a fellow riding out. We know. Get back out and keep watching! Get the sheriff. Tell him to get as many deputies as he can. Sheriff's out of town. - What do you mean? - He took a prisoner to Tucson. We'll do it without him. Mr. Moons, are you with us? If it's a fair fight, sure. I'd stay for that. Fair fight, that's a man's duty. But this way... This is a big outfit, Wade's gang. Tough. Another time, but my mother... One son buried... Go on. Go on, get out. I'm sure I can get help. Even five. Five men would give us a chance. Five would be easy. Certainly in a town this size you can get five. The street seems to be clearing. Everybody going inside. I guess they figure a storm is blowing up. - Any news? - Not a word. Think they'll find out where Alex and Dan took Wade? I don't know, but I won't take the chance. Maybe there's still time. I like a girl singing. You like a girl singing? I don't know, it kind of keeps a man from working too hard. Puts his mind at rest. Of course, she doesn't have to be singing. Dan, what time does the watch say? Almost 2:30? That leaves you one half-hour to decide. I figure when they get here, they won't come right up. And if they try to, they'll find you dead. Yeah. That's why they'll wait until we leave for the station. No, I think I'll just take a little rest. We got help. We got five down in the lobby. That makes eight. Keep them in the lobby. Don't let anyone start anything. If they don't try to get in, we don't start it. - It's almost 2:30, Dan. - All right! What time did he say it was? 2:30. When I was having supper with you last night... ...I was just sitting there, and I was thinking... Maybe someday I'd like to have a wife. Yeah, must be real nice... ...having a couple of boys like that to ride out with every morning. And then a woman like that... ...every night. Real close. That must be nice. I'll tell you, I'd treat her better than you do. I'd feed her better, get her pretty dresses she'd be happy wearing. And I wouldn't make her work so hard. Yeah, I bet she was... ...a real beautiful girl before she met you. I told you to shut up! One more word and I'll cut you down! - You won't. - I'd say you tried to get away. - You hear me? - I hear you. Do you believe me? Maybe I do. Go look out the window. See if they've come yet. Go ahead. Everything's real quiet out there, isn't it? Everybody getting off the streets. I guess they wanna get in out of the heat. Dan. They're coming. Butterfield's got some men downstairs. Go help him. I just seen them coming. - How many are there? - I didn't count. All right, men. Ben, are you all right? - What shall I tell them? - What do you mean? When shall I say you're gonna let me go? Tell them you'll write them a letter from Yuma. Charlie, go buy the boys a drink. We'll come soon. - Are you all right? - Yes. He could shoot you and say you tried to run. Kill him? They'll kill us first. Ben, tell him what'll happen if we hear a gun. He knows. He knows. Your turn, general. - What do you expect me to say? - Something that makes sense. Something that makes sense for your wife and children too. You've got a real twisted mind, haven't you? Take a look, Dan. Don't you wanna see them? I'll see them soon enough. All right. Break it up. Hey, Dan. Dan, don't make it hard on yourself. All you gotta do is drop the gun and let me walk out the door. - Listen. - Why are you squeezing the watch? You sure no one would know? Squeezing that watch won't stop time. You shouldn't get so scared. You might make a bad move. He said there were only a few. I counted seven. I didn't figure on a shootout. Come on. Just a minute, fellas. Please. Can't you see we need you? There's one of your outfit, Dan. What time is it now? What time do you figure it is, Dan? About 2:40? That's one of your outfit walking out on you. They'll all walk out on you. Why shouldn't they? I'll pay you each $50. Don't you have a duty? You wanna see us shot? Please. I'm asking you. Please, I'm begging you. Nobody wants to walk out on you. This happened in Bisbee. Why bring your troubles here? We've got families. Every man here is a family man. Dan's a family man too. I'm a family man, in a way. Let's get out of here. You see, Dan, everybody wants to live. Butterfield too. He'll walk out. No, he won't. He'll stick. He's human. At five minutes to 3, Butterfield will walk out... ...and leave you all alone. Now what do you figure you're gonna die for? Because Butterfield lost his gold shipment? Because a fool got what he deserved? I'm going up to talk to Dan. You watch out from here. Drop the gun. Dan, the roof! Take good care of him. Dan, open up. - What happened to Alex? - I heard shots. I ran. They were dragging him to the hotel. Dan! Guess that leaves just the two of you. If there's one more shot, I shoot you. Tell them. Hey, Charlie. You've got one more shot. Make it good. We'll use it going to the station. Go see what they did to Alex. Listen to me, Dan. I'm not going through with it. And you aren't either. - What happened to Alex? - Dan... - What happened? - Dan, if you think you have... ...any obligation, you don't. I'm releasing you. Alex is dead. The odds are changing, aren't they? Now it's one against seven. You have no obligation. You'd better listen to what he said. You'd better... You're real lucky, Dan. A woman like that to come home to. Alex. Dan? Where are you? Here. If he moves an inch, give him both barrels. Dan, where are you? Alice. Did you hear that thunder? - Lf you're doing this for me... - lf it rains... If it's something I said... Everything would be green. Dan, please don't be stubborn. I heard thunder. Dan, there's no thunder. There won't be rain either. If I ever said anything that made you think... ...I was complaining... ...it just isn't true because I love everything. Every minute. All the worry, all the work, all the hurts of life. If it's the $200 you need, I'll still pay. Don't go through with it. I've got to. - For the money? - No. - For me? - No. - Then why? - I've got to, that's all. I don't want a hero. I want you. If I didn't have to do it, I wouldn't. But I heard Alex scream. He gave his life because he believed... ...people should be able to live in peace together. You think I can do less? Don't. No, please don't go through with it. You know I've never been able to give you very much. No pearls, nothing. Sometimes not enough food for the family. Maybe this'll be something worth remembering. What are you saying? - Don't you think you'll make it? - Of course. At 3:00, I'll walk to the station. Then why are you talking about a memory? I mean, the boys'll always remember... ...I walked Ben Wade to the station. You go downstairs. I'll be down in a minute. It's time, Wade. Butterfield, I'm gonna take him out the back way. Stay with Alice. As soon as we get near those cattle pens... ...take Alice and drive her out of town as fast as you can. All right, then. Alice, I don't want you to worry. I'll get him to Yuma. Then I'll be right back. I'll be waiting. One more shot and I'll cut you in two. I told you, you have just one more shot. Next time, make it good. There they go! You'll have trouble making that next corner. That's thoughtful of you, friend. Go first and you'll get it from ahead. Go last and you'll get it from back here. - Worked all right, didn't it? - It worked real good. Wait. One of my men up there on the roof. Why don't you wave to him? Well, right on time. I won't have to wait. There's still time to get out of this. There's still time. Cross the street. Here we go. Now. They're headed for the train! Why the stop? To do you a favor. Run before they chop you down. Move. All right. That's not so far. We should make that real easy. Tell them to come out. You tell them. Too bad, Dan. You made a nice try. We'll be on that baggage car. Stay where you are! Drop, Ben! Drop, Ben! Drop! Go down, Ben! I'll kill him! Let's go. - How do I know you'll jump? - You'll have to trust me. Jump! - Why'd you do it, Ben? - I don't like owing any favors. You saved my life at the hotel. Besides, I've broken out of Yuma before. Well, my job's over when I get you there.
