Hey, do straight guys drink coffee? - What do you do for a living? - How long have you been a drag queen? Sorry. I'm sorry. I just- I've never known... a cross-dressing person before, so- - You know your brother. - Oh, yeah. Well, no. It's been a long time. - Yeah. It's hard. - It's hard, but I'm a bit of an optimist. Me too. I - I'm stubborn, you know? I don't give up. You know, I wasn't always in a successful show. And I had- I had this friend. He told me to give up. He called me a dreamer. - That's not very nice. - Yeah. I know. - I gotta go. - Okay. I just wanna know why you do it. Why-Why you like to dress up? You guys. Oh. I'm sorry, that's personal. No, that's okay. It's- It's kind of like this. It's like dressing how you feel inside. You know? You know what,Jeff? I haven't known your brother for very long, but I think- I mean, I think, he's happy. We've only got one life. It's just a little strange that my brother's out getting a manicure right now. What, haven't you ever had one? God, no. Well, you live in L.A. Everybody gets their backs waxed and things plucked and- I don't pluck. I- I've never been plucked. And-And I don't do manicures. Relax your hand. I'm relaxed. Wait- Look at it. It's like a claw. - Okay, I'm relaxed. - Open. No polish though. Deal. - And? - Nothing. Oh, come on. Spill it. - All right, but only 'cause we're talking guy to guy. - Right. - I've been seeing this woman. - You got a girlfriend? Oh, no. I'm gonna propose. I mean, we're at that stage where I should make a commitment. But, uh, I'm not really sure if we're right for one another. I mean, she doesn't make me laugh. Oh, you gotta get out. You gotta pull the cord on that mission. Abort. Wah! That could just be me being afraid to take it to the next level. You know, I had this girlfriend once who told me I had issues about getting too close. I stopped talking to her. Have you told your girlfriend about Robert? - No. - But you're going to? Oh, yeah. No. Well, maybe. No. I really gotta go now. This was fun. I've never missed a day of work. I work all the time. Oh,yeah. But, it's nice just to hang out. Thanks for the manicure. Don't tell anybody. Okay. Aren't you nervous? How can you eat at a time like this? I can't believe it. Oy, is there lipstick on my teeth? No. Liar. Let's go. Chickapow! Chickapow! Where were you today? Hmm? You were supposed to meet me. I thought we were gonna go shopping. You know, Carla, maybe we should watch our weight a little. I mean, we practically need olive oil to grease the zippers on these costumes. What? Don't go all L.A. on me, Connie. All these women come to our show and idolize us... because as men we have better female self-esteem than they do. Boy, you have some nerve. Are you all right? No! I was at that mall all day by myself, Connie. People stared at me. I felt naked. I can't hide out like this much longer. I need to get out of this closet. Well, you can't. Let's go. Polar bear walks into a bar and says, "I'll have a... beer. " Bartender says, "What's with the big pause?" And the polar bear says, "Always had 'em. " You suck. You're outta here, Brad. All right, uh, well, please welcome Connie and Carla and the Belles of the Balls. Let me entertain you Let me make you smile Let me do a few tricks Some old and then some new tricks I'm very versatile And if you're real good I'll make you feel good I want your spirits to climb So let me entertain you And we'll have a real good time, yes, sir We'll have a real good time Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Welcome to the show. Aren't we all divine? All right, here's the show we have planned for you tonight. Wait! Wait! Stop! I have an announcement to make. It's time you all knew. Carla, don't. I... am... an eater! That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and soon we're gonna be a full-service dinner theater. This is what America needs. To eat and watch a show where real women are real women. If you're naturally slim, fne. Okay, but come on. Starving ourselves to get thin. No hips, no breasts until we look just like little boys. Girlfriends, big or small, thin or fat, worship that body. It's the only one you've got. Hit it! So Let me entertain you And we'll have a real good time, yes, sir We'll have a real - A real good - Time Good night, Stanley. Ow! Oy. Oh. Here you go. Thank you. Cotton absorbs. Um. Surprised they don't market it like that. Mm-hmm. I- I'm looking for Robert. His cell phone is off. Is he in there? No, she's gone. You missed our show. Oh, I'm not ready to see that yet. No offense about your job. None taken. It's not like I'm itching to come down and watch you flip burgers. I'm a fnancial advisor. Of course. I can smell the stress on you. I'm not as uptight as you think I am. Yes, you are. Hey, bartender, I'm thirsty. Hey, hey. Why are you - Why are you different when you're away from all the other drag queens? - What do you mean? - I mean, it's like there's some kind of... drag queen code of behavior or something, you know? It's like- Stripes? Mary! Holy Martha Stewart's prison collection. I- I-I got three words for you, Miss Thing. No, no, no and- Four words. Yesterday! It's ridiculous. What is that? What? What was that? Oh, please, don't make me do it again. I think I pulled something. I mean, I wanna fgure it out. I really do. I mean, are you- What's the thrill? Are you hiding? Actually, I am hiding. Yeah? Some murderers are after me and I'm hiding out as a drag queen. Really. Really, I'm asking you really. I'd like to know. I wanna fgure this whole thing out. Is this the real you, or are you playing dress up? You understand? Are you- Are you playing dress up? Or is this the real you? I don't think you could handle the real me. You'd be all, "Oh, I want my mommy. " Uh-uh. It's true. Uh-uh. So a real woman doesn't scare you? No. But, Connie, you're not a real woman. Oh, you'd be surprised, baby. I know your type. You like uptight girls. That is not true. That is so not true. Really? Yeah. Am I your type? Sure. Yeah. You think I'm attractive? Connie, I've never seen you out of drag, but-but, uh, I have to say that as a broad, you're-you're a real looker. Ahh! Can I get another one, please? I have been to dinner theaters in Idaho, to cabarets in Kansas. I have watched every show in this whole country. Connie and Carla have disappeared. You're just mad 'cause Connie didn't call you. Mikey, get it through that chunk-a-head of yours, Connie and Carla- they're gone. Hey. Sorry, Mr. Rudy. Whoa. Who are you? I'm Al. I'm new. What's your problem, Al? Mikey. His girlfriend took off on him and- th-that's all. I love a good story. - Where are Connie and Carla? - We don't know. But Mikey says he got a hang-up call last night. - Caller I.D. said area code 323. - Los Angeles. - Oh. - What a story. Listen, you guys are useless to me here like this. What I want you to do is I want you to go out there, and I want you to fnd your girls. Are you serious? And when you do, call me. Why? I gotta know how it ends. Uh, Mr. Rudy, oh, thank you. Thanks. Follow that idiot. Uh, I already saw you. Hello? I- Hey! Wait! Look, I'm not- I know you're not. That was just a big- It was just a mistake, what happened. Yeah, a big mistake. Can't we be friends? No. No, we can't. I don't have time for this. This whole thing. Okay? It's not normal. Don't you think it's a little bit weird, Mr. Rudy giving us this cash to come out? - He cares about me. - Since when? I'm not sure. There's some things about Mr. Rudy that might surprise you. I heard some stuff. What'd I do? Would you fnd a map? Wanna ride? You missed rehearsal this morning. Carla, please. I just got dumped. What are you talking about? How could I not know? What, the straight guy? Yeah. But he thinks I'm a guy, so it's over before it even started. - Isn't thatJeff?. - Oh, yeah. That's interesting. It's Jeff? Right in the throat. Are you crazy? You must be out of your mind! Carla! Carla! Your knee is in my coochie! Get off!. Are you sick? Do you have some kind of death wish? Why would you take a chance on exposing us? He'll talk about it to Robert, then she'll talk. People will talk. Then those guys will fnd us and kill us! Your voice is giving me mono. Nothing happened. Back off!. You yelled at me. We're fghting. We never fght. What's happening to us? We're having a nervous breakdown. Yeah, maybe we're having a delayed reaction to the trauma of being shot at- like those guys in Nam. You can't say "Nam," Carla. You weren't in Nam. You have to call it Vietnam! - Shut up, Connie! I can call it what I want! - Oh, God! I kissed Jeff!. I kissed Jeff, and I wanna kiss him again without my wig! You can't, Connie! You can't! You did? Just my luck. I meet the guy of my dreams and he's straight! Look at us! We're ridiculous, Carla. I can't do this anymore. Shut up, Connie. We're in this because of you! It was your idea to borrow money for new costumes, even though you knew Frank was a gangster. So because of you, we saw him get killed. And then we-yes, we- got shot at. Shot at with real guns. And that white powder? That was cocaine. You got us mixed up with some real criminals. Murderers. And it was your stupid idea to be drag queens. Now we're in hiding for life as women dressed as men dressed as women. So shut up, shut up, shut up! I- You've been weird. Cut it out. Okay. I'm sorry. Girls, we need help. Open the door. Peaches and Jeff are fghting. Let's go! Quick! You won't even go inside. You won't dare to look at the show. I've asked you and I've asked you. You won't do it. Robert, I've invested days and energy in this relationship. I'm trying. But, you gotta give me a break It's hard for me to see you like this. You can't pick and choose the parts of me... that don't make you sick to your stomach. You can't have half a relationship with me,Jeff. Jeff. Oh, my God. What are you - What are you doing here? - It's not what you think. - Jeff, I can see that. So this is what you've been up to? No. Sneaking around when you said you were working? That's his girlfriend. - I thought you were seeing other women. - No, Mary. - Her name is Mary? Jeff. Introduce me to your girlfriend. Mary, this is Robert. My brother. Oh. Okay. Um, we're gonna give you guys some privacy. Jeff, they're freaks. God. She's fne. He's fne. Everything's all right. Let's just leave her alone. Maybe just a glass of water? My heart's pounding. I thought she was going to kill that girl. One who should watch out is thatJeff. I'm going to knock him into next week. I swear to God. Ouch. You know? Yeah. Christ. Let's eat. And he wouldn't stop asking me questions. It was like I was Professor Cross-dresser or something. Like he says, "Why are you called drag queens? Nobody's being dragged. You're not dragging anything. " Well, that comes from Shakespeare. Really? Yeah. He'd write, "So-and-so enters," and in the margin, he'd put the initials D.R.A.G. "So-and-so enters dressed as girl. " Drag. Okay, Shakespeare. How about Ophelia Up? No. Wanda DeCountryside? It's not me. Devoida Talent? Stop it. Personally, I like Wanda DeCountryside. What are you looking over here for? That's your side. Turn around, look over there. Come by later if you wanna talk. Oh, sweetie. I am all talked out. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - You okay? - Yeah. I've got guy problems. Oh, sweetie. Come on. Welcome to What's Up L.A.? A dinner theater that's full of drag queens? Holy stockings. Gorgeous- Connie and Carla, there you are. If you could just spare us fve minutes. A big hit here in West Hollywood. Just tell us a little something. Don't be so shy. You've made a big splash. It's just a local station. Our viewers are dying to know you. Okay. - What makes you the best drag queens ever? - Honey, we do our own singing. No lip-synching for us, toots. We do all your favorite show tunes wrapped in a delicious dinner. That was a big mistake. We have been flirting with disaster ever since we went on that stage. Carla. Connie. What are you doing here? What the hell is going on? How did you fnd us? Carla, how come you're a guy now? Uh, Connie. I think a lot of people just saw that. Yeah, but it's local news. There's no way that that Russian or Rudy guy saw it. Mr. Rudy. Our boss. You work for Rudy? He sent us to fnd you. What? What the hell? You just tell Rudy that we wanna live. We're not gonna tell anybody that he killed poor Frank. - Wait. He killed Frank? - You should listen to some of the guys once in a while. - Al, we saw him kill poor Frank. - To death. - What happened? - Rudy knows you're in L.A. - We gotta get out of town. - We can't. The offcial dinner theater opening is tomorrow night. We can't let everybody down. They're depending on us. We can't do that to Stanley. Why'd you cheat on me, Mikey? I didn't, Carla. Ever. Al just made that up because he was mad at Connie. Come on, Carla. Don't go be a guy. You don't understand, Mikey. I like doing the show. I'm good at it. I like being Carla and Connie. - Connie and Carla. - Yeah. How come your name's always frst? - It sounds better. We talked about it. - This is serious! - We know. - So let's go already. Hold on. I need time to think. Your voice is giving me shingles. We need time. Connie's gonna make a plan. I'm gonna make a plan. She's gonna make a plan. Fine. Call us at this motel. Room 209. First thing in the morning. You wanna stay over? Yeah. Mikey! - Carla, let's go. - Connie, did you miss me? No. Yeah, you did. Rudy. I find them. I'm an ass. I should've seen your show. I should've told my girlfriend about you. I should've loved you and accepted you... and been okay with the fact that you wear dresses. I'm sorry, Robert. It's just that when you left home, it was hard on me. I was 12 years old. I wake up one morning and you were just gone. You didn't call me. You never even wrote to me. I got kicked out. What? No. Mom and Dad kicked me out. They found my bra. You thought I left? Yeah. Well, whatever happened, Mom regrets it. - She does? - Oh, yeah. Dad too. Ha. No. They wanna see you. Jeff, for the frst time in my life, I like who I am. Forget it. I wanna be part of your life. I'll say hi to Mom and Dad for you. And Grandma too. Okay. Oh, uh, and Jeff, uh,just a heads up. My roommate, 'N' Cream, is on a tear to kick your ass. - 'N' Cream that- Oh, the little- the little- - Yeah. The- - Tell him- Tell him to bring it. - Make a joke. I warned you. - Thanks for the warning. - Go, go, go. Go. Hi. Hi. Robert's not here. Yeah, I know. I just came from up there. Uh-huh. About the other night, I wanted to- Yeah. Um, how's Mary? Well, we talked about things for hours. It's not good. I mean, the relationship, it's just- We broke up. Oh. I wanted to apologize to you. Um, you're not freaks. You're not a freak. I hated seeing you hurt. Thanks,Jeff. I have fun when I'm with you. Well, all of you, you know? It's just, I'm not - I know. You told me. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. Bye. Good morning, L.A. Looking at the freeways, three cars got together on the 101 at Winnetka. Mikey. Connie and Carla will call. I know. Sahara Motel. Hi, Room 209. I'll connect you. Hello. Hi, Al. Connie.

We gotta go! No. Carla. We're gonna die. I am so sorry for dragging you into this mess. I love this mess. Thank you for dragging me. Pun intended. Listen, who says they're gonna fnd us in this big city anyway? Would they be looking for a couple of queens? Here's my plan. We launch the show. We stay for one night. The audience sees how great the guys are and they come back, and Stanley doesn't lose any money. That's a good plan. I know. One night. One last show. Okay? Okay. So, I've been thinking. We should have the guys enter from the back of the house on "Good Morning Starshine. " Oh, honey. If you're gonna enter from the house, you've gotta do it on "76 Trombones. " Debbie Reynolds!

No more lies. I'm sure you're all wondering... what the cops and- First, we owed some money, and then we saw something... and we've been hiding for a while, pretending to be something that we're not. Hey, who saw Yentl? So Barbra Streisand wants to study the Talmud, right? But, she can't because she's a woman, so she pretends to be a man, and, uh, one thing leads to the next, and before you know it- Uh- Everybody- Everybody believes that she's a man. So she has to keep lying - even though she wants to stop, she can't, 'cause she has to keep lying to people that she cares about. You know, that have been really kind. Look, uh, we're women. No, you don't get it. We're women. Oh-ho-ho. Oh-ho-ho. We're sorry we lied. So sorry. Boo. Get off the stage. Let's go back to Chicago. The patio door is shut and our hair is caught in it. I know.

You always made me feel beautiful. - But we thought you were men, and you're not really men. Oh, honey, who is anymore? - I thought something was up. - Me too. - No, you didn't. - Girls, in an art form based on... being true to one's real self, welcome to your outing. - Jeff? - Connie. - Oh, great. More drama. - You came to my show. - I love show tunes. - Hey, everybody, this is my brotherJeff. Hi,Jeff!. Hi. You look, uh- You look different. Jeff, I'm a woman. It's an authentic look. Yeah, but- No. I mean I'm female. We're girls. We were faking it. It's this long story- Connie, please, we've been over that. Really. Really? Really? Yes! Well, I could get used to that. Jeff is the guy? Yeah. You're the guy. Get up here and kiss her, you fool. - Ooh. The fnale. What? - The fnale. - Oh!
