And I'll do it again and again and again as many times as it takes to scrub this city clean of all the filth. I've got my badge and I've got the will. I am LAPD. So let me show you how it's done. Oh, my... oh, my god! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Just like that! Just like that! Oh, my god, oh, my god. Oh, my god. I don't know how you do it. Just keep going, and going. I'm just doing my civic duty. Oh, um, look, I know we don't really know each other all that well or anything, but... Confirmed, suspect is on premises. Transmitting location. That's me. Back to work. Thanks for the jump. Let's do it again sometime. Super crank! That's what I'm calling it. It's got a nice ring to it, right? Yeah, this city loves its street drugs. This is the mother of them all. And they are gonna pay through the nose to get it. You guys want a free taste? Huh? Forget it! Did anybody else feel that? Feel what? No. No, no, no, no, no! - What the fuck is that? - Yo, headcase, we better split! Don't... don't call me that, it's Harry! Not... Let's get the fuck outta here! Headcase Harry, you're under arrest! Fuck you! Let's get the fuck out of here! That's assaulting a police officer. - That's resisting arrest. - Headcase. - Don't call me that! You have the right to remain silent. Fuck you! Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. Take Miranda rights and stick 'em straight up your ass, pig! I know who you are. That was my life's work you just trashed! If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Shut up! Do you understand these rights as they were read to you? Do you understand this? You know what this is? Don't make me do it. Stay back! Fine. Boom. Any scanner activity? Unbelievable. Holy Christ, no way anyone could have survived this. I know you're new to this detail but don't be a fucking idiot. Of course he didn't survive, they knew he wouldn't. Hey, a little help here. - Well, there he is. - Officer crispy. All right, guys, let's load him up and get him back to the precinct. You're a cop. Pow. Part of the motherfucking brotherhood. You're one of the good guys. You're LAPD... You're one of the good guys. I'm a cop. You're a cop. That's right. Officer gable? Inside, gable. You might want to calm down. Good morning, sergeant. Yeah, right. Ooh, little filly. Is that all the work you put in? You could do better. Stop with the dicks. And you, yeah, go to my office... 'Cause there's someone who wants to talk to you. Uh, should I sign in first? Now. I was told, um, someone wanted to see me? Officer gable. Chief Berringer. Come on in. Close the door behind you. Interesting psych profile. You like being a cop, don't you? I mean, you take it seriously. As a heart attack. We have been keeping a pretty close eye on you. And for the record, there were one or two individuals who felt it was premature for me to have this conversation with you. Clearly I didn't listen to them. I went with my gut on this one. So here you are. Chief, am I in trouble? - Depends on how you look at it. - I don't understand. You understand how bad it is out there? While you're chasing jaywalkers down the 3rd street promenade and making your chicken-shit collars some real heavy shit is going on right here in our city. Do you think you're ready? I think you're ready. Are you ready? Damn straight. Have you ever heard of the fortune 500? Well... speak. Harry's operation has been compromised. Compromised? The LAPD sent their... beast. They've got balls sending that kamikaze cop into our territory. Their overconfidence is annoying. Goddamn it! Nobody fucks with the fortune 500! I want his head on our wall! Get the fuck out of here. Let's face it, gents, headcase was their opening salvo. I bet they think it's open season on all our operations. We have to hit back, hard! This has gone way beyond the concept of deterrents. But let us not be despondent. On the contrary, let us rejoice! We have access to the ultimate WMD... A pure ass-kicker, par excellence. What are you talking about? - Sir? - Get me zen master flash. So... Are you sure this crazy fuck has the goods to take this on? He's got a rep, that's for sure. It's more than that. He's the best. Not to mention, he's got a ready-made army full of bad-ass motherfuckers at his disposal. Even if this escalates into a war, it'll be theirs, not ours. That's good business. Fine. I still want his head. The fortune 500 are the top tier of organized crime in this city. Almost every freak on the streets is connected to them in some way, shape or form. Money from drugs, from illegal firearms, from protection rackets, you name it. If it's illegal, they are deep up in it. These folks are a force of nature. And how are you supposed to fight that? Try not to look like a rookie. I'll do my best, ma'am. And cut the ma'am shit. - Yes, sir. - Everyone ready? They brought him in a few hours ago. He's downstairs being prepped for a general recovery. Okay then, let's go. These technicians are part of a special division, top secret. A lot of private funding, which means it keeps the mayor and the city council off our ass. What's the smell? Oh, that... You'll learn to ignore that. Chief? Chief! Chief... are we talking... I think you know exactly what we're talking about. All the rumors you've been hearing, they're true. - Okay. - Look, it doesn't matter. It's no secret what's going on out there. The grinks and the groinks, the pest and the vermin, they're taking over. We don't have the manpower or the resources to properly police the streets. But you know what they say? I don't, no. Fight fire with fire. So we got ourselves a secret weapon. Holy shit. Is he dead? What do you think? Of course, he is. - Uh, but... - All systems go! Fire up! Watch this. Opening channels a, b and c for immediate download. Initiate! - Okay, clean him up! - Get that uniform off. Patholomic levels are stabilizing. Cardiac activity is normal. Oxygen intake, circulatory system, everything's back online. There you go, gable. Goddamn miracle of modern science. It doesn't matter how broken, how mangled, how completely pulverized he gets out there, what happens in here makes him whole again. Well, relatively speaking. Officer Downe reporting for duty. How you doing, Terry? Ready to get back out there? I was born ready. Chief, does he even know... Best not to dig too deep into the details. Technically this is still an experiment. Just let him do his thing. Look at you. Do you stand for what's right and righteous? Yes, you do. Are you ready to crush some criminal cranium? Yes, you are. He's talking to himself. Shh. Because that's what you do, isn't it? Who else can? No one. - Where's he going? - The armory. Oh... The skells and shitheads... They're packing like a third world country. They've convinced themselves they own this city. It makes me sick. So what are we doing about it, Terry? We're gonna take it all back, chief. What's he doing? Gathering up his correctional equipment. My baby. And all the baby food he can eat. All righty then, down to the motor pool. So, he just picks up right where he left off? That's all he knows. He's the perfect cop. That's incredible. How? - What do you mean, how? - I mean, how! What kind of technology can actually bring someone who's clinically dead back to... You were vetted pretty extensively, rookie. Your psychological profile suggested you are adequately equipped to deal with these particular circumstances without struggling with any of the moral implications involved. That's exactly why you've been brought on the inside. I had a feeling about you, and I hate to be proven wrong, so you need to tell me right here, right now, are you focused? - Absolutely. - Then let's go. I see my ride's waiting for me. Parked it right where it always is. This town's infected, Terry. We need you to make it better. We need to show them what's what. I will show them the law. Okay, rookie, you're on. For what? One thing we learned this last round, we need to do a better job of backing him up in the field. What do you mean? I'm putting you on this detail, his back-up detail, a special unit that will stay close, but remain unseen alongside officers Carter, Fritch and Hanso. I'm sorry, I don't... He'd never call in for support. Point of fact, he won't even know you're there. I'd imagine he'd be pretty pissed off if he knew, but you'll be there all the same. But in case of what? I mean, chief, no offense, but he doesn't... When the time comes, you'll know what to do. Uh, chief, you said he'd be pissed off if he knew? Did I say that? Yes, ma'am, I believe you did. Then don't piss him off. As far as I'm concerned, you're good to go. You've all been administered your extra dose of alkyl nitrites, and our chemists have assured me that you'll peak exactly when you need to. Just make sure any erectile activity... doesn't interfere with your combat moves. First things first, we'll need to get his attention. Shouldn't be too difficult, our target tends to get involved in some serious shit. She will see you now. About fucking time. Please watch your language. Remember where you are. All right, and where exactly are we? I mean, this place... This is a house of divine truth and I detect the stench of deception all over you. - You what? - Do not misunderstand me. When you enter this room, you should reek of nothing but respect. Fucking hell. You're, uh, mother supreme? Indeed I am. Welcome to the guardian angel covenant. - It's nice. - You have come to do business? Yeah, I'm Dominick, I've come to negotiate. Negotiate? On whose behalf? Well, my boss felt as though there might be some, uh, wiggle room when it comes to the price? He wants what you're selling. He just hoped that instead of a long-term payment plan at your price, that we would pay our price, all in one lump sum. Fucking nice little package to you. Do you know what I mean? A fucking nice one. Another broken down street mongrel trying to walk tall. Look, this is no way to do business. I was told you'd be amenable. Who told you that? Who do you think? Your boss... Your boss has no balls. Sorry? My boss... Your boss has no balls! Is she allowed to talk like that? He sent you here with no real knowledge of what you are dealing with. Do you even know what it is that we do here? Do you even know what merchandise you have been sent to negotiate over? No. I wasn't given that information. Of course you weren't. If you had been, you never would have come, and yet... Here you are. Now you must pay the price. Look, sister... You don't want to fuck with me. You do not want me, or my boss, making trouble for you in here. This... Is what we sell. You're gonna shoot me? A fucking nun? You're gonna fucking shoot me? Of course, not... they are. That should send the appropriate message as to how we negotiate. Take him down to the morgue. Fucking hell. Gun running nuns? Are you fucking kidding me? I wish I was, rook. These bitches are hard-core. - Five months we've been bui... - Don't start! Well, well, pardon me. I'm pissed off. Hey, our detectives, they've been workin' with the ATF. Right, and now all of a sudden, this super cop, he gets to roll in there and get the bust. What we doing? We're babysitting, that's what we're doing. - It's bullshit. - Goddamn it. You want to be the first to go in there? You know what goes on in there. Come on, Hanso, we just armor up, knock that shit down, easy-peasy. Easy-peasy, is it? I'll be glad to explain that to your wife and two daughters. Hey, fuck you, man, they know exactly what I signed up for. Oh, yeah, right, tough guy, wanna go in there all Martin Riggs and show them what's what? Uh, who? Martin Riggs. Mel Gibson. Lethal weapon? Oh, right. That's ridiculous. No, no, that's ridiculous that you don't know that. Come on, Hanso. Okay, so when exactly do we go in? Wait... have you not been... Is he fucking shitting me? We don't go in, not until it's done. Until what's done? Until he's done. Is there anything left to harvest? Well, not his balls. Freeze! You're under arrest. Our house has been defiled! Now let us find the perpetrators, whoever they may be, and finish this. You have the right to remain silent. - Well? - Well, what? We go in, right? Sorry, rook, not yet. We got our orders. We wait until shit calms down, then we go in. Right now we relax and enjoy the fireworks. What if he needs us? Yeah, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey. Holster your weapon, cowboy, all right? Cool your jets. This is the detail that you signed up for? Aren't we all cops here? What are you trying to say, rook? Huh? Are we all cops here? I know three of us are cops. I'm not saying anything. Bless the dark ones who speak with thunder! Scramble. Scramble! Scramble. Station to special unit team, Berringer is requesting a status report. Roger that, we're holding position here. We need some back-up to form a perimeter to keep the civilians out. Copy that. Back-up units are en route. Okay, we're good here. Soon as shit calms down, we can secure the area. All right, and the stiff techs fish Frankenstein out of the wreckage, what a bunch of fucking bullshit. Hey, where's the rookie? This motherfucker. You have besmirched the sanctity of this blessed soil. And for that, you shall receive righteous punishment. Mother supreme. You better be praying. Freeze! LAPD! You seem troubled, young man. We can help you here. Sorry, lady, I'm an atheist. Now drop your weapons. With all due respect, I cannot take seriously one who has abandoned his beliefs in a higher power. I'm LAPD! That is my higher power! Shall I put one between his eyes, mother? Patience, sister, perhaps this one will come to his senses. Drop your weapons. Do not make me shoot! Holy shit. Hey, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hold up. Look, she's in custody. Let's do things by the book! The book? What? You will all be judged. Shut the fuck up! Oh, fuck. Ah, shit. Are you fucking kidding me, rook? This is gonna be your ass. We're inside, requesting immediate back-up! Is he dead? Rook, is he fucking dead or what? Looks like I had you pegged all wrong. You couldn't keep your dick in your pants, son. Chief... When I talk, that means you don't talk. I gave you explicit instructions on how to comport yourself on this detail, and that's because I made a judgment call on you, looks like I might have made the wrong one. I had a long talk with Carter and Fritch and even Hanso. Those three never seem to agree on anything, except where you're concerned. What did they say? They said you were a chatty, little fuck. They said you tried to be a hero. You asked me to be back-up. I'm a cop. I backed him up. We should have been in there sooner. That little stunt at the convent could have been your ass! He almost went for you, didn't he? Huh. You should have listened, but you pissed yourself. Well, in any case, I have a problem. You're on the inside now. I can either put you back on the outside which would put this whole program at risk, or I can give you one last chance to get your head out of your ass and help us make a difference in this city! That's him. So you know what I need from you? I guess so. Do your job, be a shadow. You might not understand what we're doing, but right now that's not my problem, and you know what? It's not yours, either. Can I help you? I'm officer gable, I'm on downe's field detail. Yeah, whatever, as long as you got clearance. Welcome to the bullpen. So, um, what are they? I mean... Well, each of them suffers from some sort of motor neuron disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and some stuff they don't even have names for yet. It's actually pretty amazing. I don't get it. Look, for whatever reason, and I sure as hell couldn't tell you why and I spend most of my time with them, they all have telekinetic abilities, on a level that we can't even measure. Telekinetic? Yeah, telekinetic, the amount of energy that this group produces you wouldn't imagine. It's enough to... To bring someone back from the dead? Exactly. We call it the resurrection equation. We harness the energy, we channel it up into the recovery bay, where it regenerates and resuscitates him. You know, that whole thing, every single time. That's unbelievable. Yeah, it's pretty cool, right? How did they pick Downe? Oh, this is a great story. Uh, Terrance Downe, full-on Metro division, from back in the days, an intense guy, fanatical. Fanatical about what? About being a cop. His freeway pursuits were legendary. He never let anyone get away. Of course, his enthusiasm, uh, ended up costing him. Well, what do you mean? Well, he had, how shall we say, a little accident. The circumstances under which he passed away left his body in a state that happened to be perfect for this particular experiment. How long ago was it? - What? What do you... - That accident. Oh, I think it was about 25 years. Twenty five years? Most stuff doesn't happen overnight, son. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I... It's just amazing what science can do, I guess. Goddamn right, this is the cutting edge of technology right here. There's gotta be a down side to this, right? I'm not sure I get what you're driving at. Well, have we ever lost one of them to this process? Uh, yeah, a few from before my time, but it's the nature of the beast, I guess. Nature of the beast? These poor souls sit down here and are forced to... Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you talking about, forced? Nobody's forcing anyone. These people are volunteers, each and every one of them. - So they know? - Yes, of course, they know. This gives them a sense of purpose, you can see it in their eyes. See what? Pride, pride in what they're doing, pride in what they're contributing to. Does Downe even know about... You gonna keep staring at me? Hey, Downe, listen, no hard feelings, you know, about what happened earlier. I just wanted you to know that, um... That I... I was just trying to help, that's all. What the fuck you talking about? What am I... I was in the convent, um, I made the arrest. Intense guy. No shit. I don't have a lot of time, baby. Let's just do what I came here to do. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Just like that! Just like that! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, my god! Oh, shit. This is starting to feel like the good old days, eh? Goddamn it! We need to talk about mother supreme. She got busted. Her entire operation is godless. Good for us, less competition. Except you got the same intel I do. It was that cock-munching super cop that took her down. So he's still out there. What the fuck is up with zen master flash? He is taking his sweet time, and on our dime. And worth every one of those dimes. You know his reputation. If he hasn't moved yet, that just means that what he's got planned is gonna be rather nasty. - Excuse me. - Yeah. Whiskey coke. Are you LAPD? Because that's who we like to serve here. Okay. Do the thing, man, do the thing. Well, well, well, lookie what we have here. Officer integrity, officer ethics, officer dipshit! Yeah, everybody... listen up, we got a hero in our midst. "Cause this kid right here, he's angling to be super cop's new partner. You know, you really got some balls... Think that you can walk up in here like you one of us. - Okay, look, I'm a cop. - Yeah? I'm a cop, yeah, just like you, just like Downe. Bullshit. No, you're not a cop like any of us. Hell no. And if you think anybody in here is anything like that fucking freak, you're wrong. He's drunk. I don't think I'm too drunk to kick your fucking... - Come on! - Hey! All you fuckers stand down! You're all cops here, the assholes are out there. You save this shit for them. The next one who gets in somebody's face is gonna get this horse cock up the side of his head. My mom gave this to me, and she taught me how to use it. So who wants it, you? Anyone? Fuck. Come on, buy the rook a drink. Shot! To that, to that, to that. Whatever, fuck off. Shut the fuck up! So, Downe been in here? Are you kidding me? Not a chance in hell. - He don't fraternize. - Not with anyone. Okay, I don't... I don't get that. What... Do you think we want to do this detail? Getting that freak's back? No. No, fuck that son of a bitch. I will fucking lay my life down for each and every fucking one of you. Because that's what it's all about. You see, I only have to do it once. There you go. And that's what makes it bearable. You really can't say that, though... Because you don't know how he does it. Nobody knows how he does it. You know how he does it? Do you? You know something we don't, rook? What the hell would I know? No, I guess you right. All I know is there some old Franken-science shit going on over there. I mean, you're talking about like a bunch of dead body parts and their corpses, like, smashing together. I don't think that's Downe. You got Boris Karloff with a badge and that's some bullshit. Who? - Oh, no, Boris Karloff. - What? Frankenstein, movie! You mean Frankenstein's monster. What you mean by that? Everyone always calls the monster Frankenstein. But the monster was created by Dr. Frankenstein. It's not Frankenstein, it's Frankenstein's monster. Stop the music. Stop... The music. Look at you. You a cop? Yes, you are. Do you represent the law in this city, your city? Yes, you do. Without you, it's all over. Too much crime, too much chaos, too much madness. Do you ever ask yourself, why? No, you don't. There is no more why. Get it together. Lock it down. Lock it down now. Multiple 10-34s reported at cedar Sinai at Beverly and San Vicente, all units respond. Center, this is officer Downe responding, I'm on my way. I don't like that. Well done, students. Like sending up the brightest flare to passing rescue ships. This will get his attention. Shh. That's our target we're hearing and he's coming fast. Prepare to slice and dice. I'll be back in a flash. Everybody freeze! Good god. Why do you care so much about that guy? Isn't it enough that you get to clean his litter box with us? I don't really like that part of it, but what I'm saying is, I don't blame Downe. Yeah, I mean, I don't think I do. Right, because Downe is an innocent victim in all of this. Meanwhile, the good cops, talkin' about the ones that we've been toasting to all night they're out on the street risking their shit for god knows what. And you know what happens when they eat it? They don't come back! If you can stand, get down to cedar's, it's a fucking massacre over there! Let's go, motherfuckers! This shit is real! Fuck it. Let's go be fucking cops! Any asshole I see flashing a blade... No Miranda? I was hoping to hear you say it. Anyway, does this count as a blade? Well, would you look at that? Some Kung-fu cowards. Motherfucking cowards. I see you're resisting arrest. Well, that means I'm gonna have to bust out my favorite piece of correctional equipment, lethal force! Is that the best you've got? That's assaulting a police officer. Little bitch! Punk ass! If you can't do the time, don't do the crime! Look at you. I'm not quite as impressed as I thought I'd be. Guess I need to lower my expectations. You... have the right... What's that? To remain... - Come again, son? Mm... tasty. Silent. Ah, do tell. Students, observe the coup de flash! If you can... Your mama! Cracka-boom, motherfucker! And that, students, is what precision work looks like. But don't worry, he's not dead, not quite yet anyway. And so, on we go to phase two. I told you he'd get the big bastard! I hope he burned him like a witch! Like a bitch! We'll get the deets any minute now. One of our lieutenants is in direct contact. This is a righteous fucking victory! Let's see the LAPD come back from this. Who runs this city? Talk slow, I want to enjoy this. I need to hear some key words, eviscerated, decapitated, castrated. Go on. Well, masters, how about kidnapped? Apparently zen master flash subdued Downe and transported him to another location. By all accounts, he's still alive. What! You gotta be shitting me! What's he think he's gonna do? Get ransom money from the LAPD? That wasn't the deal we made! That motherfucker! Okay, okay, just put your peckers in park, and we'll figure out exactly what the fuck he's up to. Holy Christ. Jesus. Goddamn fucking blood bath in here. Check for survivors. Holy shit. Does anyone see his body? Who gives a shit? Look at this fucking place. Zen master flash... Speak fucking English. As you wish. The visionary that I am, I realized the most entertaining thing to do now would be to bring down some friends to dance with you. Maybe you remember them. So, all you rats in the rat's nest... Let's find out just how much damage this cop can take. What the hell are you doing? That's a good question. Jesus. No, just me. Come to rub it in? I mean, the freak is finally gone. He's missing in action, he's cut up into tiny pieces, spread out all over la. That's all that's left. So that's it, then? He's gone, what are you gonna do? You gonna turn in your badge, too? Hmm? That the kind of cop you are? I don't know what kind of cop I am anymore. What does it matter anyway? We blew it. We were his back-up, we blew it, besides when it gets out what my blood-alcohol level was when I showed up at a crime scene... That's it for me. Being a cop was all I had. No wonder you like him so much. What is it? Personnel file, dating back to the late 70's, Terrance Downe. What? Wait, this is back from when he was... Alive. You think you got a one-track mind. This motherfucker was king cop from day one. No family, no attachments, nothing but the job. You're wondering if he's being exploited or some bullshit like that? The file has the whole story. We all read it, by the way, so, if it makes any difference... We hate him a little less now. You are LAPD. You are in the motherfucking brotherhood now. You are a motherfucking cop. I'm a cop. That's right. - Officer gable! - Chief! You show up at a fresh crime scene after floating all night at the rusty nail? With those jerk-offs in your detail? Are you going after Downe? Downe is not your problem! He's nobody's problem! It's over! It's not over! Do you see this? It is not over! Where are you going? Gable! Stop right there, rook. Don't fuck around, gable! This is beyond you! Chief... Obviously he walked into a trap. It was only a matter of time before... Before what? Before the department cuts Downe loose because it's not cost-effective to keep him around. Don't get political on me, you little shit. Oh, okay, so what? You're not gonna go after him? You're just gonna find the next test subject? What did you say? Chief, I know about the bullpen. The what? The bullpen, the telekinetics you have down there. What the fuck do you know about that? I know enough to know that if they're what's juicing him up, and they've got that connection with him, however it works, then maybe we can use them to find him and help him. Bullshit. Gable! I've decided to use you to send a little message mainly to your comrades in law enforcement. You see, the most annoying thing about cops is that they think they're in charge. Let's fuck you up! They need to be shown who swings the biggest stick. This is your whole career right now, gable! Count on it! I don't care, we gotta try. You don't even know what they do! Okay, what's happening here? Shh. Gable... I'm betting they can either track him or they can help him. And either way, it is worth a shot! It doesn't work that way! They cannot bring him back unless the body is upstairs. Is that true? Wh... Uh... Are we talking about a long distance revival? Yes, yes, we are! Well, I have no idea, it's never been attempted before? Why are we talking about this right now? Okay, but you're saying it's not impossible. Get your ass out of here right fucking now! He is still a cop, chief! Isn't he? Fine. Fire him up. This is a very bad idea. - Do it! - Okay, all right. If this doesn't work... You all know Terry Downe. He's the recipient of your abilities, of your talents. He's one good cop, knee-deep in the shit every day, no matter what it costs him. And it costs him a lot! Now he is out there somewhere. And he needs your help, all of you. And even though he may be beyond repair, you have got to try. And you have to give it everything you've got! Come on! Isn't this what you're all here for? Guys, give me some room. Kick his fucking ass! Kill that motherfucker! Fuck yeah! Fuck you, man! Gable... Cut him down. Damn, still breathing. Don't die yet! Don't die yet! Yeah! Come on! That's it! That's it! That's it, that's it! There you go. Stop! Mother supreme, you sexy rat. You have been judged as unworthy. You have been judged as unclean! Radiostatic particle build-up, lots of telekinetic energy being generated with no place to go. I gotta bypass the local receptors. This is the price you pay for your lack of belief. Come on! You can do it! You push it! That's it! Yeah! There you go! There you go! My god is a vengeful god. He speaks through me. Come on! Come on! You can do it! Come on! Come on! You can do it! Push it! Come on! Oh, no, no, no, no! He tells me you resist the afterlife. He's gone. We're right on the brink. You resist the everlasting glory. Organic circuits, they're overloading! They can't handle the feedback! Shut it down! Shut it down! No, don't shut it down! You want to be responsible for losing them, too? Come on, come on, shut it down! I guess that's it. This time you will join the endless, blackest night... The eternal sleep... Your final penance. - Oh, my god, oh my god! - What's happening? Don't you see, chief? They're doing it on their own. They're not giving up. Their power is being sucked out of them, no idea how! They can't do this much longer. They are burning out right in front of us! Uh-oh. Damn you, motherfucking face fucker! Oh, shit. You're not supposed to be out of your cells, are you? Back off. He's all mine. You ain't done yet, fuck face. We all up out of this motherfucker. And we gonna take our new-found freedom and shove it right up your cracker ass! So bend over wide. Think about it, shithead. This badge, it means something to me. It means that I am the order in a world full of chaos and you are the chaos, all of you deranged motherfuckers! But even more than that... Kicking your heads in makes my dick hard! Did it work? Holy shit, it worked, right? Shut the fuck up, gable! What do we do now? Mobilize all available units. - So you know. - Wait, wait, know what? King county prison, reports of massive riots, all hell's breaking loose out there. Go. Come on! You wait this long to check in and then we hear you turn the rat's nest into a war zone? You had him! What makes you think this was the right time to make some goddamn political statement? I despise politics. The warden of this facility might have been in your pocket, but I am not. He's dead, by the way. Your fatal flaw is that you lack vision. Listen to me, you prancing fuck nut! You can consider our contract terminated! Try not to get so emotionally involved. You can forget your payment! You don't fuck with the fortune 500! I see, then allow me to convey how I'm going to roll out of here once I've finally roasted this cop. I'm going to find the lot of you. No matter how far you run, no matter how well you hide, I will find you. And when I do, the pain I shall inflict will have you begging for death. Oh, shit. Zen master flash, I'm bringing you in. Shut up, Kung-fu! They told me you were unkillable. I say you've died 1,000 times and with each death your soul is eaten away little by little. You have the right to lay down and die. Hiya! Die. Jesus Christ. Come on, keep moving, just follow the blood. Let's get him back to headquarters. Come on, what are you waiting for! Move it! Let's go, you assholes! Help him out! All the systems are go. Maybe we should let him be. What? I mean, let him rest in peace. Rest in peace? What does that even mean? You're the one who convinced me to bring him back. Something we all need to get used to here. You, me, everyone in here. This is the world we live in. Is it fucked? Probably. And if that's the case, you know what a fucked up world needs most of all? A cop. Damn straight. But not just any cop. It needs a cop that'll never give up. It needs a cop that always comes back, and we've got him. Right or wrong, we need him out there. Maybe I just thought that after everything he's been through... He'd finally done his duty. You think so? Huh? You think it ever ends, rookie? Chief... don't call me rookie anymore. It's officer gable. Very good. Light him up! Accessing bullpen. Updating communications a, b and c for upload. Initiate. Accessing bullpen, opening channels a, b and c for download. Initiate! That was a rough one, chief. We can't be certain that his mind is still functioning. Good job, thank you. Looking good, Terry, just like new. I need to see them, now! Now. You get it now? I hope you're not expecting a vacation or anything. Your job's not done yet. It's never done, chief. Never. That's what I call a motherfucking haul! Yo, you think the fortune 500 is gonna want a piece of this shit? Yo, just 'cause they got their asses kicked doesn't mean they ain't still running shit. No, I heard they got more than their ears boxed in. They got their nuts kicked in. Hard, real hard, and you know what that means? What does that mean? It's the wild west up in this motherfucker. Every crook for himself, baby! Woo! - Yo, chill out, man! - Yeah! Woo! Just because they got fucked the fuck up doesn't mean that they won't fuck us up. We got the juice in this town now. Madness and mayhem, as far as the eye can see. Not a badge in sight! It's beautiful. It's fucking beautiful, man! Pull over, cocksuckers! You're under arrest! Wait a minute, are you saying Terry Downe wasn't the first? Every experiment requires beta testing including this one. These monster bosses have an iron grip on the underworld that can't be broken Once he's loose in the city it's all over. They kept him locked up for 30 years. What do you mean nobody knew? At least, that's what they want you to think. I will make them all suffer. No, stop, don't let him out!
