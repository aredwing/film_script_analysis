Chase, dude, game's on, game's on. Dude, I'm trying to hit the ceiling. Chase, what do you think I'm going to ask you to stop doing? What do you think any parent on god's green earth is going to ask their child to stop doing? What they should not be doing in the house? Stop bouncing that ball! - Come on. Come on. - Go outside with one of those hairy-looking assholes. Hey Krisha, how's it looking? It's perfect. Okay, you feel like we got everything? You have, you did a great... Oh, my gosh. Sweetheart, what are you doing over there? I have an entire cabinet full of Tupperware and there is no lids. Honey, second shelf. I see it. Just grab it. It's right there. I got it, I got it.

That's my husband for you. Okay, all right. Okay, so secret ingredient. Yes. And the red onion. Yes, because of the smell. Aunties. Oh. Sorry, Krisha. She's a little jumpy. She lives by herself. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm hiccy-uppy. Oh, you're doing laundry? Yeah, Darks. Do you have any? I have Darks. I have workout clothes. Oh, perfect, I just need to fill out the load. Aunt Krisha, you don't have anything? No, no, I'm good. I'm wearing my Darks. First and ten! First and ten! First and ten! Ooh! Sorry, love. Sorry. Eventually we'll get this done. One single most... important question... That's what I'm talking about, baby! Dude! What? Don't hit me with a pillow, it hurts. The pillow has buttons on it and when it hits you... This is like a mutant. I know. It's huge. But we have... Look at the people. I know, it's time. And I was late. I was late, so I get it. Mutual respect for personal space. Oh, my god, okay. They are way loud. Okay. Hey, BB, Augustine, come here, guys. I've got to tell you all something. Okay listen, this is super important. Um, we, Vicki and I, are going to pick up GG and so it's going to take us, like, several hours. We got to get down there, we got to dress her. I mean, it's a holiday, we got to bring her back. So, Krisha, if you realize you're missing an ingredient, you call. Oh, wait, your phone doesn't work... I have a phone. Will you call? Yes. I think we got everything. But, you know, if we're missing anything. Or one of these lazy boys can go to the store. Okay? Krisha, it's going to be all right, right? I'm good. I'm good. You wanted to do it. I do. It's important to me. Okay. I appreciate it, I really do, but I gotta go get GG. You want her here, right? Yeah. Okay, all right. I'll see you guys in a little bit. Okay. Hey, Dave, babe, did you find the bottle? Just ask them now. I... I'll ask. I'll ask. Do you have everything you need? Who goes out and picks up dog shit in nice boots? Come here. Come here, you. Good boy. Come here. Who's a big guy? Come here, sweetie. All right, you got it. Oh, lord loves a working man, that's slimy as all get out. You ready? You ready for this? You ready? One, two, three. Oh! God, I'm sorry, that was me there... Stay. Stay. See you guys later. It's all good. You ready? You ready, chase? Yes. Positive thinking. Oh! Just grab a mug. You know, you could always model for baseball trophies. You know, you're about the right size or whatever. I could see you just popping up on top of a mantle. Hey, Krisha, wait, wait, wait. Whoa! Let me help you. Let me help you. It's way heavier than I thought. It's like 30 pounds. All right, now, you hold onto the cutting board and I'm gonna slide it off. You ready? Yes. Whoa, baby. Let you in on a little secret there, Krisha. I fucking hate dogs. Hi-four-and-a-half! Your goddamn sister. Oh, god... Vicki, Vicki, Vicki... You sure married into the right family for a guy who hates dogs. If it ain't strays, it's shelters... The fosters that she falls in love with. She gets behind the glow box, there, and she's on the websites finding the dogs and they're just a bunch of asshole-licking menaces as far as I'm concerned. Oh, come on... No, I just as soon... I have a soft appreciation for euthanasia, I'll tell you what. Oh, my god. Chase! All that shit talk, man! That's 100 bucks! That's $50 right there. I'll tell you what... Why don't you cook two of these dogs tonight? Would you do that for me? Then we'd be down to 14. Would you do that for me? It doesn't even have to be the pony over there. Everybody all right out there? Let's go again. Come on. Okay, there. Ugh! All right. Let's see... We have that... Mine do, too. Mine's right here. Well, you're in the locker room, so if there's anything you want to divulge. And between me, you and the fence posts, I never offered. Okay, then let me just ask are you still on all the blood pressure medications? A lot of the blood thinners. Couple of beta blockers. Uh... What about the... Are you doing anything to counteract that? Any... - Viagra? - Whatever? Yeah. Shit fire, man. I've got an erection that you can hang a damp topcoat on. Okay. Strong. Strong. We should not have even opened the... It's a strong, proud erection! The worm can is too full for me now, so... Speaking of worms, I tell you what... Let's put the lid. At best, this is a garden snake. It's a king cobra! Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Some days are better than others as far as the litany of pharmaceuticals that I am acquainted with. Oh, and you know what, I hear you, because mine are all legal right now, believe it or not, but, um, I hear you on that one. Yeah. Oh, shit. Come on, chase, come on. Come on! Come on. Chase! Chase! Shut up! He's older than I am. He's older than I am. I'm actually... okay, god, how am I gonna share this... I am working on... Get out of here, bone-ugly thing. I am working on becoming a more spiritual person. And I mean, I am working on it. I am working on finding a peaceful person inside me. Well, I'll tell you what, it's a daily investment. Um, and I am good with the expletives and the superlatives and I know I am a quality imperfect soul, but good god almighty, I try, you know. I put up an awful lot with Vicki. If these 12 fucking dogs are any indication. But we have beautiful children. Oh, my god... you do. And this brand new... Did you check out the pupa in there? How about that little... So sweet. I know. We needed a baby. I know. She's gonna fetch... She's gonna fetch a good price in the market, she is. Oh, my... Did I not tell you? We're gonna sell that baby. Are you kidding me? A full-headed white baby like that! Stop. Six digits, easy. You are too much. I'd get $100,000. Oh, jeez. Okay. Trey! Trey, can you come here please? - Yeah, one second. - Thanks. Volume, please. There's a sleeping baby in the game. - I can't... - What port is this? What? I don't know. This is the old USB port. I just got so much going on. I got so much in my mind. I'm juggling so many things. I'm juggling, like, five things right now. All right, all right. Just chill. And then there's this, "do not plug this device into your PC "until all the installation steps have been performed." Like, when was I gonna find this? When was I gonna find this? Where did you find it? On the... on the floor. Okay, so it's not talking to... those are all my files. Yeah, I got it. I got it. Those are all my patient files. And they're not talking to each other, I don't understand. All right, did... Will you give me that cord, the blue one? What, this? Yeah, the blue one. I mean, if I need something new, it's going to be another $1500. I know. And then it's gonna be a year. It's going to be like a year before I get anything set up! I know. You know, I need this... What... What is that? You're good. It was the wrong cord. You had the right USB port. Well, how did you know that? Oh, god. It was all the cord. It was just the cord? Yeah. You know, just got a lot of financial, you know... I'm just under a lot of financial strain right now, and, uh... You doing all right? Yeah. I'm good. I just want to get you set up as soon as possible. Yeah, I do, too. That's... that's what I'm doing. I know. I know. One more semester. Yeah. Almost there. Yeah. You need anything else? No, no. I'm good. I'm good. You sure? Yeah, I'm good. You're okay with all of this, right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. All right, come here. All right, call me if you need me. All right. Hello, Dr. Becker. Steve, how are you buddy? Hey. About that golf game... "Atheena was madly in love with this super cute boy." "And a sweet little girl who just loved her cat, Twinx. "The lovely, purple-haired yogurt slinger. "But I couldn't understand his jibber jabber, so I shot him." Jesus, that was good. It got dark. It got really dark. "Chase and Alex look like little boys at the catholic church. "They dreaded drowning into an elephant's waterhole "and we swam naked with unicorns that told us secrets "and the secrets were gold." That's good. That's really good. Is it all right if I just have a little catch-up with you? Yeah, sure. "They were the very best part of the action drama Terminator 2..." "The action drama?" "Made Logan feel very amazing about himself..." Just come find me. Okay. Just woo me a little, because you never woo me. You just show up and you're like, "hey, honey, I'm kind of horny. "I woke up with a boner this morning. Let's bang a little before I go to work." Also, "can you toast my muffin?" I don't say, "let's bang a little." I don't use the phrase, "bang a little." Well, it feels like you do. What do you say? You say, "hey babe, I woke up with a boner." That you do say. Yeah, because that's a fact. That's just... "Hey babe, I woke up with a boner. "I feel pretty big today. "Let's just get one in real quick. You know what I mean. "Get one in?" Yeah, get one in. Ugh! That is not... What? Like... do you know anything about women? These come up. These come up. What does? The bed. Oh, my god! This? Yeah. The "up" button. Would you do that? Would you... Oh, in a heartbeat. Oh, yeah. You would? You wouldn't pay like a lot of money for that, though? It depends on how much it was. I think it's like per woman, right? Yeah, probably for sure. I think it's a... Guys, I prefer to leave this door open. Oh, shit! - Uncle David. - What... Hey, uncle David David: What are you doing? This was chase's idea. We came in here for the bed. Gentlemen, what is this? This is unacceptable! Is this the halftime show? I don't think so! All right, let's turn this off right now, shall we? Sorry. Sorry. I said turn it off, I don't want... Jesus Christ. I'm sorry. Sorry. Chase! Maybe we could go up right now. And have... A little tongue. Looks nice. Yeah. Nesting, you know. Settled in. Just wanted to make it nice so we could have a little chat and catch up. Sure. So... So, how are you? What's been going on in your life? I'm good, you know. Just busy. Yeah, I don't know that. It's why I had to ask you. I'm just... Busy is good. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just busy with school, you know. Trying to finish. Almost there. Cool. So school is going good? Yeah. I always forget. Is it marketing or management? It's, uh, business management. Yeah. And what about your film stuff? Uh, you know, I don't know... I'm doing school and maybe the focus is on that and getting a job and something and then doing something with film, I don't know... Well, I hope you do, because you love it and you're really good at it, and... I always thought you'd go to film school. Yeah, I don't know. I mean I haven't even really done anything... What are you talking about? Since you could hold a camera in your hand, you've been filming things and making people laugh and cry. You're great. You're really good at it. You are blessed in that you have a passion in your life, right? And when a person has a passion, they gotta jump on it. You gotta go with that when you're young, otherwise you get trapped, you know, in something practical. Right? Yeah. And I could have told you all that if you had ever asked my advice. If you had answered my calls or my texts. It's just... like I said, I've been busy. You know? It's like a full load trying to finish. Are you mad at me? Mmm-mmm. For sure? Mmm-hmm. Honey, you don't have to study business just because it's what they want you to do, all right? You're a very talented filmmaker and that's what you should be doing with your life. Mmm-hmm. You have a gift. And don't let people tell you what you can and can't do with your gift. Mmm-hmm. I want us to be closer, Trey. I want us to have a real relationship. I do, too. Really? Uh-huh. Then why can't you even look at me? Honey, I got my shit together now and I'm going to change my life so that I can be closer to you. I'm gonna move to Austin. I'm gonna live wherever you live and I'm gonna let you live your life. But I just want to be close to you and make up for lost time. Don't you want that? Why will you not talk to me? Okay, I brought this up too soon. We can talk about it another time, all right? My bad... Did you ever think that maybe I like business management? That that's what I want to do? Totally sorry. Totally sorry. Way too soon! Not cool. Don't be mad at me, okay? Please. Baby, you... Trey... I'm gonna go downstairs. Please. You know how much I love you, right? That's not gonna come off. Yeah it will. Give me the hose. It's not coming off. It's coming off slowly. Dude! I took a fucking shower this morning! It's just water, dude. Fuck you. No! No! Come here! Come here! Come here, I got you! I fucking love you! Where have you been? What have you been doing? I have been living a life in which I have tried to become a better human being. And that's as much as I'm interested in saying to you about it. This is a place of healing. Right here, here it is, Krisha. This is it. You can say anything, anytime, anywhere. You let me know. When it's all said and done, I'm married to your goddamn sister in there and I'm family. Thank you, and I appreciate the offer. And as soon as I have anything really, incredibly revealing that I want to say, I will definitely come right to you and say it to you, dude. Well, I'll tell you what, you can even write it down and I'll read it later. Okay. Shut up! Very subtle. Shh! Shh! Not bad. Who would move a timer from the kitchen? It's... It's okay, babies. It's okay. Niko, Niko, it's okay, baby. Lord god in heaven, and this pony over here... You can put a saddle on that one. They can feel your vibe, okay? You need to just chill it down, and then they will chill it down. Animals are very intuitive. People are very intuitive, too, Krisha. I know things. I am certain that you know things. There is no doubt that you know things. I'll tell you what, there are some things that I wish I didn't know. You are heartbreak incarnate, lady. You are a leaver. That's what you are. You are an abandoner, that's what you are. And I am sorry that there is a certain harshness, but this is the reality of the situation. And if you think that you can just pop in and pop out of people's lives like this, you are mal-informed. You are mal-informed! I have stayed away while I was healing myself. And you are not going to change that. Fuck! That's two times. My feelings are that you just make it sound like you're some college kid, just popping your way across the alps on some little European backpacking excursion, trying to find yourself. Jesus shit-wind, you're in your sixties! Get your ducks in a row! I always stayed the course, though. I always stayed the course, even when I was miserable with your sister! Miserable as all get out! You think I give two shits about these nine fucking dogs that fucking schlep around with me everywhere because they're hers? Geiger counter. Give me a break! The stuff that I put up with! I am fucking superman! I fucking eat leather and shit saddles! Okay, cool. That's great. Cool. You might give a little thought to the fact that your wife also was putting up with you while you were putting up with her. Because that's the way it works. I am an imperfect soul as well, Krisha. And I know you are wounded, like some damned bird that just... Hit one too many windshields. But I'll tell you what, them cars are getting faster and them wings are getting weaker. Hey, everybody. I got GG. Vicki and I got her. Come say hi. You got lots of people to say hi to, mom. Hello. Here's chase, you remember chase? Good to see you again. I remember this fella. Yeah, that good-looking dude. Looking good. And then the other good looking dude right there. How are you? Good to see you. I got the beard now. Isn't he handsome! Beautiful. Oh, thank you. Yeah, and here's Atheena. Hi. Uh-huh. Hi, dearie. You're the real beauty of the group, but don't tell 'em... She's the real beauty of the group, she says. I don't know what that means about the rest of us. - Good to see you. - And there's Augustine. - Remember her? - Oh... Thank you. So good to see you. And here's David, mom. Good to see you. Oh, I like this man. She likes to be kissed on the lips, honey. Look, mom, it's Trey. Hello, grandma. What he just did... Was it... He fooled around and then he kissed me. Yeah? And then he kissed me... - Oh! Wow! - Oh! How are you doing? Do you remember me? Who is that, mom? What'd she do? Is that a yes? Who is that? What do you think I... Do I remember you? I don't know. If I hadn't been there, you probably wouldn't have been born. Yeah... yeah. She was there when you were born, I think. You look beautiful. Yeah, she was the doctor. You look... Give me a hug. You look beautiful. Doesn't she look good? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. You're beautiful, too. And speaking of beautiful, mom... There she is. Look at that. Look at that, she's sleeping. That's baby rose, mom. Isn't that the sweetest thing. Isn't that the sweetest thing? Mom! Mom! Look! It's Krisha! Look over there. Aw! Isn't she beautiful. Look at Krisha, mom. Mom, there's Krisha. Hey. Her name is Krisha? Her name is Krisha. Yeah. After you? She... That's Krisha. Your daughter. No... Her name is rose. You know me, right? That's your middle daughter. Huh? That's your middle daughter. That's Krisha. I'm Robyn... The baby isn't named after me. She thinks the baby's named after me. No, the baby's rose. What's... What's my name? Who is that? Come on. She knows who you are. It's Krisha. Your name is mama. What's my name? It's Krisha, mom. It's Krisha. Huh? I know it's Krisha. Okay, good. So, she wants to know you know it's her. She's happy to see you. I'm so happy to see you again. She's happy to see you. What did I do wrong? You didn't do anything wrong. Anything wrong. I'm the one who always did the things wrong. Nobody did anything wrong. We're all happy and we're together. When you lived with your grandmother as long as I did... No, your grandmother... My mother... very seldom did I please her in anything. When she got older, she was just... I know... She was grumpy, wasn't she? - She tried hard, but she... - I know... just had so much she could do. We... we were lucky then. We were lucky... 'Cause we got a good mama - who loved us a lot, right? - Yeah. - The sweetest mama. - You are a good mama. She's the sweetest mama. You stole my... The beauty I saw... A woman who just was confused because she always was embarrassed about where she was born and where she had lived and stuff. No, now, she was embarrassed? And she, so she kept... Yes. She kept herself down a lot like that... Mmm. Oh! And I couldn't talk to her, she'd say... I knew... I knew... Okay, you go ahead, Krisha. Mom, we're going to go get you something to drink. How about some cold water? Okay? Okay. Give her some cold water. Yeah, I'll give her some, too but you, let's get you some, okay? Well I'm all right without it, but she's... All right. - Pretty upset. - It's okay. I don't know how we're gonna find it. Look, I'm gonna get you a drink... You have a perfect forehead. You're silly. Okay. What are you worrying about? Trey is... I don't know, he's kinda going to that place. He's okay. Trust me, I think he's okay. I think this is really important for him. And it's important... It was important for me to get her here and do this. I know you're worried about me... and him. But it's gonna be okay. I really believe it. Okay? I just need you to be there and just support me and know it's okay. Okay? Did you get your walk in today? I did. I walked this morning. Will you go do your karate or something? That'll make you feel better. Thanks for taking good care of me. I love you. I love you, too. Hi, this is Richard. Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hey, Richard. It's me, baby. Um, can you call me back when you get this, please? 'Cause I could really use a hit of your voice. Thank you, baby. Hey, I didn't mean what I said and you know it. Okay? Love you, baby. Bye. I'm back, I'm back. Does she look like she's getting sleepy? Does she look sleepy? Yeah. Now you gave me a smile. Mmm... Yes she did. Yeah, she gave me a little, short smile. - Yes, you did. - She likes you. She does. She likes you a lot. Yeah. Do you like grandma? Hi, grandma. Are you a good baby? She's a good baby. You look like you're a good baby. Yeah. You wanna get a little closer to grandma? Here we go, big move. Trey, are you all right? Okay. Yeah, it's fine. Fuck me... What happened? What did she do? Honey. Oh, my god, that's my... We gotta get her up. Oh! Wait, honey... Don't... I'll tell you what, grab a leg for me while it's down there. Shut up! You're... I want you to stay here. You just stand there, okay? Okay. I'll be right back. Get all that. Don't... Logan, don't worry about what we're going to eat or what we're not going to eat. All right? I can tell you what we're not going to eat and most of it is in that trash can. All right? Oh... come here now... Krisha... Krisha, where did this come from? - It's not mine, Robyn. - I swear to god. What do you mean it's not yours? It was in your bathroom. - It is Doyle's. - Excuse me? He's been drinking out in the dining room all day. Nobody talks about that. He drinks all the time and nobody says anything and I'm the fuck-up... Young lady, you are incapacitated right now. I would choose your words very delicately and very carefully. You are disaster incarnate and you have ruined a perfectly good evening! I saw what you did to the Turkey, all right? Please stop, please stop. Okay, okay. Your cocktails, your pharmaceuticals and your recipe is no excuse, young lady, for your insanity and your dementia! - Stand down. Stand down. - Okay, listen to me. You're not coming over here, Krisha. I need... He's been through a lot. You're not doing that, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, it's all right. Fuck me... Oh, god... - Hi, this is Richard. - Leave your name and number... - Hi, this is Richard. - Leave your name... Hi... Hi, this is Richard. Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Well, hello, Richard. Yes, I'd like to leave a message. I want to say I hope you're very happy. I hope that you really like the way this all turned out. When you didn't return my phone calls. When you told me to "need" you. "Call me if you need me, baby. "Yeah. Be vulnerable. "I'm your big man, right? "I got your back." Well, it's too late now, okay? All of my hard work. It's too late. Because not one fucking person on the planet would answer the phone when I call them for help. So, you know what? Fuck you. You're dead to me. You were a complete mistake. I should never have even met you. And I certainly shouldn't have loved you. I always have loved you... I loved you and... And you fucked me over like this... Really, really... You don't know who I am. You don't know anything about what I've been through. What I'm here trying to do. You couldn't care less. Okay. You can keep your phone off 'cause I'm not ever going to be calling you anymore. I wish you were dead. Yeah... funny, huh? You motherfucker! I wish you were fucking dead. Uh... Hello, baby. Hello. Thank you. Thank you, sweetie. I love you, baby. I've always... I need you. Don't growl at me, dingo. Don't do it. Don't growl at me! Oh, baby. Oh, baby. I love you. I'm so sorry. Oh, god... Krisha. Hey, Logan, wanna get me a chair? Krisha, you need to go back upstairs. No. It's okay now, Robyn. I came to apologize to everybody for the Turkey thing, and I'm cool... Krisha. I want you... I've earned a right to be at this table with my family. You need to go back upstairs now. I'm not going back upstairs. Yes, you are. I'm going to sit down at this table... I won't even eat any of your fucking food, okay? It's not my fucking food. You're coming with me. Do you understand? Now! You're upset. You're... You're embarrassing everyone. I'm good. - Krisha... - I'm sorry... Come back. Krisha, come back. - I fucked up. I got it. - I fucked up. Krisha, I have no idea what you're doing. I really, don't even know what you're doing. I just told you that I was sorry, Robyn. I don't think "sorry" really cuts it, Krisha. Do you know that every person that I love is in that room, every one of them. And I thought you were... I'm so shocked. I'm disappointed. I really am. Did you lie to me? No! I don't think you've been sober, Krisha. You told me you were sober. I have been sober, Robyn. How long? I didn't think you were really sober. Oh, Krisha, I don't really know how you can lie to me about something like this. This is so important. This was your chance. How do you lie to me? This is Bobbie. I've been taking care of you your whole life. I don't know how you could lie to me. I have to tell you this, Krisha. Trey did not want you to come. Because he was scared. The whole family was scared. But I defended you. I told everybody you did the work. I told them. I shouldn't have let you back in my house. I'm gonna be sick. I shouldn't... right now? Okay, go in there. There's a... Go right there. Let me put on the light. It's right there. Are you all right? I don't know... I don't know what's wrong with you. Put this on your head. Oh, god... Oh... Krisha, what's going on with you? I don't know. I don't... There's something wrong with me. Beyond the drinking. You know, like, I'm stupid. Beyond that. It's like, I thought I could come here and I would make it all okay, right? I looked at mom today and I looked at Trey and it was like... "You fucking blew this. You blew it." You didn't blow anything for good. Trey totally hates me now. Krisha... He's mad at you. It doesn't mean he hates you. There's a big difference. He's really just hurt. There's a lot you missed. That doesn't mean you can't fix it with him with time. But you have to do the work. That's all there is to it. You have to do it. Ugh... I thought I was doing the work. It's a lot to handle. Like I'm... I honestly, I was like, okay, right? I was, like, together. I was healthy. I was like... And then I come into the family... Well, that can happen to anybody, Krisha. I'm the one, right? There's a lot of dynamics. I'm the eggshell one. Yeah? But one thing is true, Krisha. We all do love you. I love you for always. No matter what happens, I'm your sister. You just love me because I'm your sister. No. I love you for who you are but we have a... We have a life together. We have a history. With our mom and our family. And I'll always love you. But you've got to get it together. But it's in there. You've got to find it. I can't do it for you. Everyone here loves you. But you've got a lot of fixing to do. Because you've hurt people. Yes. Right? You can do that. You can do that. You can find that inside yourself. I promise. It's not too late to do that. Okay? Will you try? Please? I love you, Bobbie. I love you, too. I want you to try. Please try. I will try, Bobbie. Okay. That's all I can ask. Do you know what you've just done? Every person that I love is in that room. Every person! He didn't even want you to come. Because he was scared. The whole family was scared! But you know what I said? "Oh, no, she's done the work this time. "She's sober now. She's ready." I can't believe it! It's just so hurtful. I don't know how a person does this to another person. And I've really had enough. I've had enough of you. - I'm your mom. - Krisha! You came out of my body. You came out of me! No, you look at me and tell me... Krisha! You love me right now! Krisha, get away from him! - I want to hear you say it! - Krisha! Get away from me. You shut the fuck up! Don't tell me to shut the fuck up. This is my house. You shut the fuck up! Get away from him! Like you all... All care so much about me... Well, you know what, I do care about him. You left me, you abandoned me and you took him and you gave... You abandoned him! What the fuck are you talking about! - Tough love! - You... - Tough love! - Oh, tough love! What the fuck... You are turning him into one of you. And you know what? I'd rather be one of me than one of you. I'm not your fucking son anymore! See? Did you hear that? Shut up! Don't tell him to shut up! Stop! Stop it! Get off me. Get out! Get off! Stop! Stop! Get her out! Chase, get her out!
