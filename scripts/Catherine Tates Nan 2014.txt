Knit you another sign that says, "Go and fuck yourself!" Security! Yeah? Yeah, you call Security, love. Me and this extremely fat man...will not take this lying down! And he can barely get up. I do Pilates! Good luck to you, love, every little helps. I go three times a week! Yeah? What, they got a canteen there? I'm not that fat! Security, please remove this woman from my desk!

I filled out a form from the red section and I sat in the blue section. I've done everything you asked me to do, now...could someone please fix my bastard taps? Right, Mrs Taylor, we've processed all your forms and I'm afraid to say that, unfortunately, it is not a priority case. Not a priority case?! I'm 75 years old! Nonetheless, you're in good health, you live alone... What you talking about?! My granddaughter, Alice, lives with me now! So you have another person to help you around the house? Well, she's no help, she's useless. And...blind. Blind?! Yeah. Say hello, Alice. Poor blind Alice. What?! Just say hello! In front of you is a spinster... ..what smells of cats and loneliness... ..who wants to help us. Hello. She's not blind. She is! Why's she holding a book? That's mine. Percy Jackson And The Lightning Thief? You're reading that? Yes, I am. "It's perfectly paced with electrifying moments "that chase each other like heartbeats. "The New York Times." She's not blind, Mrs Taylor. We can all see she's not blind. Well, she can't! May I remind you, Mrs Taylor, that impersonating someone with a disability is a crime. You calling her a liar?! My poor blind, ginger Alice?! There is no way this girl is blind! Of course she's blind! If she weren't blind, she'd duck. You see? You all right, love? Security, please! Oh, leave off! I can't see! Oh, it's no good now, Alice, she don't believe us. Put your hands behind your back. Yeah, all right, I'm coming. Oh, I suppose this means I've got to clean out the khazis now, does it? Come on, Alice, we're off. No, really, I can't see! Oh, don't take the piss, love. Hark at this. "Dear Deirdre, I found my husband wearing my underwear "and I don't know what to do." Deirdre says, "Your husband is exploring his feminine side, "support and encourage him on his journey." What a load of old shit! I once caught my old man eating butterscotch Angel Delight, I slung him out for a fortnight. That cured him. Cos of Angel Delight? That's how it starts, love. One minute they're tucking into some nancy pudding, the next minute they're trying on your drawers when your back's turned. You've got to nip that in the bud! COMPUTER BEEPS Oh! Here are, here are, put it on there. 'Nan, are you all right? You look worse.' I'm all right, darling. You look tired, though, son. You should come home and get some rest. 'I've been up all night.' With Agadoodoo? 'Ngudu, yeah.' Is that shit on your face? 'It's mud, Nan.' That's none of my business, love. 'We've been building a hut for...' When you going to come up and see me? You going to come up and see me? 'Nan, how bad is it?' Nan! Nan, the doctor! Oh, I'm going! 'What?! Nan?!' Where's Alfie? Er...he just popped to the toilet, doctor. He isn't supposed to get out of bed. I know, doctor, but you know Alfie, he fought in two world wars, he's too proud to pony on his mattress. Finished. Alfie is a very ill man, Mrs Taylor! You have been grossly negligent and if there's any relapse in Alfie's condition, I will hold you entirely responsible. Thank you very much. Can I get back in bed? Of course you can, darling. You can have a nice rest... just as soon as you make me a nice cup of tea. SHE CACKLES Ta-ta. Nan? Yes, love? I'm not going to do this any more. Do what? I've put in for a transfer. I'm going to be working with another lady. What?! Well, it's just... It's not you. Well, I know it's not me. Of course it's you! It's definitely you! You keep getting me into trouble. You nearly blinded me and... you're not very nice. You told me to stand up for meself. Yeah, well, good for you. I don't need you anyway. Who you going to buddy up with instead? Her name's Lizzie Maynard. Oh, not old Lizzie Maynard! Good luck with her, love. What a moaner! She don't stop banging on about her boiler. Boiler this, boiler that. Yeah, keep a lid on it, love, there's people with real problems out here. Boiler! Boiler! Boiler! Have fun with her, love. Bye, then. Ta-ta! Here, Alice. Yeah? We had a laugh, didn't we? No. OVER PHONE: 'Please state clearly the nature of the repair.' Me tap. 'Please repeat that.' Me tap. 'I'm sorry I don't understand "me-tap".' Me... bastard...tap! 'Press zero for more options.' Oh! 'If you are calling regarding recycling, press one.' No. 'If you are calling regarding pest control, press two.' No. 'If you are calling because you are Mrs Joannie Taylor, 'please find something else to do with your time and never show your face again at the council office.' Shove it... up...your...arse! Innit hot?! You hot? BUZZER Number 561. SHE SPEAKS FLATLY Hello. I am a woman. I was wondering if you might help me. The flat what I am currently staying in has a problem with the taps. And what is your name? Mrs... Smith. Is it? And what is the current address you're staying at? 10 Devonshire Court. How interesting, that's where a Mrs Joannie Taylor lives. With her blind granddaughter, yes. And according to our records is no longer allowed within a one-mile radius of this office. I didn't know that. Just as well I came instead, then. I just want to know why you suddenly changed your mind? It's the council's decision, not mine! But you could help! What's the matter, sweetheart? Miss Donnelly says she will not allow my son to get married in the Community Centre because they're not allowed to have a religious service. What?! That's disgraceful! First your wedding, now my taps. When are you going to get off your bony arse and help us? I'm not! And I am delighted to say that this little charade of yours is now officially over. I have you on camera attempting to commit identity fraud, engaging in abusive behaviour and contravening your restraining order. Yeah, and what part of that's against the law? All of it. Is it? Is it? Right, well, I won't keep you. Oh, come on, don't be like that! How long we known each other, Darren? It's Geoff. Well, it's close enough. Oh, no, you don't! You can't get away with this, Ms Donnelly. Here, what you doing here? I thought you'd left me for old Lizzie Maynard. Oh, she kept banging on about her boiler. I told you, didn't I? Excuse me, what is going on here? You are in contravention of council rules, which stipulate that all employees must prioritise members of the community over 74 and always treat them with respect. You've been fucking horrible! NAN CACKLES That's Braille, by the way. Of course I'm horrible! You try dealing with you scum day in, day out. I mean, look at you all - layabout, junkie, thief, murderer, halitosis, an extremely fat man! For goodness' sake! My BMI is only slightly above average! How dare you speak to these wonderful people like that?! Who do you think you are?! We are a community! We are individuals who come together! ALL: Yes! Whether Indian, morbidly obese... ..drag act... ..or Muslim like meself. We are a community who supports and cares for one another! ALL: Yeah! Right? Yeah! And if you won't let these fine upstanding people have a wedding in our Community Centre, then fuck ya, you miserable old witch, they can have it back at my flat. ALL: Yeah! ALL CHEER I'm afraid that won't be possible, Mrs...Smith! As a council-owned property, parties of over ten people are not allowed. Yeah? Well, thing is, love, it ain't a council-owned property. I own my flat. Bought it back in the 1980s. Thank you, Mrs Thatcher! How do you like them apples? SHE CACKLES ALL: Yeah! Well, if you own the flat, you're not entitled for us to fix the taps! Well, it was worth a try, weren't it? Come on! All back to mine! # I said to me mother let me 'ave a talk with Dad # When he came to the telephone, he wasn't half mad # Said, "She's got no sense, silly little cow" # "If he comes round here there's gonna be a row" # I don't care, I don't care, I don't care if he comes round here # I've got my beer in the sideboard here # Let your mother sort it out if he comes round here... # I didn't realise there was this many of you, you're multiplying like a virus. Right, no, you're not bringing that elephant in here, what do we do if it needs to go to the lav? I've already been to the toilet! Make yourself at home, love. Here, listen, it's only one onion bhaji per head, all right? Thank you so much for helping us. It's all I could do, darling, after all them lovely curries. Hit it, boys! ALL: # I don't care, I don't care, I don't care if he comes round here # I've got my beer in the sideboard here # Let your mother sort it out if he comes round here # I don't care, I don't care, I don't care if he comes round... # Nan! Nan, what is going on? I thought you were on your deathbed? Oh... Yeah... I got better, didn't I? I left behind a whole school of children who needed help. Did ya? Ne'er mind. Here, while you're here, son, you couldn't have a quick look at my taps, could you? SHE CACKLES Hit it, fellas! ALL: # I don't care, I don't care, I don't care if he comes round here # I've got my beer in the sideboard here # Let your mother sort it out if he comes round here # I don't care, I don't care, I don't care if he comes round here # I've got my beer in the sideboard here # Let your mother sort it out if he comes round here # I don't care, I don't care, I don't care if he comes round here # I've got my beer in the sideboard here # Let your mother sort it out if he comes round here # I don't care, I don't care, I don't care if he comes round here # I've got my beer in the sideboard here... # Well, that's that, then. I've got me school holidays on Monday. That's it, is it? Well, yeah, officially. Oh. Unless... Well, I mean you could always... If I'm ever passing. If you're ever passing. I could come up and see ya. You could come up and see me. And I'll bring you that cake you like. Ha-ha. I'll save you a bit of...sag aloo. I just want you to know... Yeah. ..you made me feel really special and... EASTENDERS THEME PLAYS Yeah, wrap it up, love, me programme's on now. SHE HUMS ALONG Move your head, love.
