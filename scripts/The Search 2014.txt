There is a Chechen proverb: "When a bear decided to eat her baby. before killing him. "She soaked in the mud." That's what they did. They said we were spies. terrorists. They took everything we had on us. The papers. money. gold jewelry ... Then they ordered us to follow them. I understood that it was the end for us. Noura headed towards them and she begged: "Boys. what are you doing? "You do not have a mother? "What do you want?" "That's what we want!" Shouted one of them. And they started shooting. I saw the head of Larissa break. Then I felt a bullet enter my body and I lost consciousness. When I woke up ... I had a terrible pain in the feet. It smelled smoke and diesel. We were under mattresses burning. I crawled into a cellar. Old Russian women lived there. took me with them. They took care of me. They saved my life. There were still people in our neighborhood ... I do not know what happened to them. But I fear the worst because of "SOBR" the unity of the Russian army which controls the entire area around the "54" school. It's them ... It is they who have killed us. Noura ... Larissa ... Me. - Hello! - Hi! Carole. your mother called four times this morning. I promised that you would remember. OK thank you. You told him what? That if she wanted to date me. she had to kiss his girlfriend. That's rock'n'roll. And she said what? Nothing. But you really said that? Of course not. you're stupid or what? What are con te ...

In general. children are supported by the community. Families run by clans. There is a strong solidarity. It is rare for children are delivered to themselves. but in this kind of conflict anything can happen. Many children are lost. And we do not know why. one day a kid is doing. Maybe he's smarter. or smarter. or just luckier. But imagine what is trying to put them in the head. You mean we manufacture future fighters? I do not know. I try them to other models. but I am very worried. I do not see the Chechens to surrender. It's been ages since it lasts. It's just scary. And if the international community does not intervene. how can we to end this situation? I agree. In your opinion. what is the most urgent? What the European Union should act first? Everything is urgent. People need everything. But I know that for people here. that the world has not forgotten them. is important. Of course. Thank you. Thank you.

Go to your pack. Thank you. sir! I turned and saw a man running down the street. The face covered in blood. torn shirt. the distraught look. He tore his gray hair. and repeated: "Oh Allah. Allah. pity. pity ..." Suddenly. I understood it was Mussa. uncle. I barely recognized. It was a mild and pleasant man. His wife died a year later her marriage 15 years ago. And he never remarried. He stood alone. Maliqa his daughter. whom he adored. He was running slowly. like a puppet. and murmured: "Maliqa. Maliqa. my little girl. my God. pity ... " His house was in ruins. My two brothers pursued him. Me too. By repeating the name of his daughter. my uncle is thrown on the ruins. My mother hugged and tried to calm him. My brothers and other men started searching in the ruins. Women were remote space. Body Maliqa was found half an hour later. She was crushed by a wall. She was dead. We took her to the mosque. with other corpses. In the court. we heard the first helicopter returning. We all fled. We left. We left without taking anything. Nothing at all. My uncle wanted to stay to bury her daughter. When the Russians arrived. they caught him. and tortured. But nothing could make it worse that having lost her daughter. They gouged out his eyes. He went mad now. Because the last thing he saw. it is the Russian soldiers who were laughing. My mother says that's the reason why he went crazy. This is the last image he took it away before plunging into the dark. Have you news of the Foreign Affairs Committee? No. I have not. I keep calling. but for now. impossible to have an answer. What is terrible is how people do not care. That's incredible. Even in my family. the only thing that interests them. This is the New Year. The year 2000. there more than that counts. I know what I'll do! Oh yes? Yes. I go to the family of my boyfriend. It's his family that takes care of everything. they have a nice house. It'll be great! Sounds good! We too did a dinner with both families. I'm happy. it's going we change ideas. I bought a dress but I have not told him yet. Me too! Except me. I told him. because I can not hide it. And I bought the French perfume too. Yes? And you know what you gonna do? Me? I'm going to my sister ?? s. She also had a party with her in-laws and our family. That's great! Yes. This is unbelievable to live such a thing. It's crazy. Yeah. it's crazy! I am going! No no no! Wait! Wait! Wait ... Get up! - What do you want me to do? - Wait! Get up! I thought of something. Why do not you commit? You could help us with children. You would be paid. Not much. but ... I do not know. I do not even know if my brother is alive. I understand. But you have to think you. Raisa. This is also your life. How is it that you speak English so well? I wanted to go to America. You can still do it. There is no reason not to go. You see the little one. there? He was always alone. He had skin problems. he struck black anger. No one could calm him. we could barely talk to him. Everybody thought he was lost. And ... one day. he began to write stories like crazy. He could not stop. And miraculously. he began to get better. You know why? Because ... gradually. telling his stories. he began to talk about him. He shared his story. And that's how he found its place in the group. And he finally found. despite what happened to him. That's my job. Make them understand that despite everything that could happen. they are alive! And they are entitled to a better life. And that's what I want that you help me to do. Agree? You think about it? Come on. motherfuckers! Move your asses! We cross the square. And we take position. Got it? Go for it. if it was me who stumbles you! Get moving. tarlouzes band! Forward. go! Go. get yourself fingers ass! Forward. go. go! Sales fags! Come On! Yuri! Yuri! Fuck! What you did to my son? Damn ... Oh my God ... What I did ...? Fucking asshole. what are you doing! - I killed someone ... - I'm sick assholes! Poor con! But who sent me morons like you? Listen to me! You rebuke position. And you cover the right! Get it? - Yes! - Dark! Forward. forward. forward! Yes! I'll tell you something. pal. Why do you think they were there? By chance? Forgotten in their home? It is the Chechens who put them there! Chechens! Sometimes they send little girls packed with explosives. What you actually believe. There's no Chechen innocent! You have to understand that. Very quickly. No mood with these black asses. believe me. In any case. an old man and a kid. it is very impressive ... What a picture of hunting! Next time I'll do better. For me. it was like ... a deflowering. A virginity! A virginity! This is the first Once you kill someone? Yes. Yes? We will have a job. The Committee on Foreign Affairs auditioned me next week. I do not know. I'm very scared. - I'm afraid to be completely isolated. - No no. You did a great job. Yes. but this is not an exam. If it's just a well-written file but that came to nothing. it's all useless. Yes of course. but does not rely on you! It is only a tiny part of the story. At least you'll convince people. For us it is already extraordinary that the truth is told. There was a woman there. She keeps looking at me. I do not know what she wants. Them? Yes. You know them? No. She said you have him stole her necklace and ring! I know. it is impossible but she insists. She wants to know where you got them. I'm sorry ... Tell him he does not speak. It's an orphan. You think it is a reason to fly? You think it's an excuse? No. You're right. I ask you just not to overwhelm. That's it. Do not protect. It does not help at all. How will he do when you distributed? You should no longer think of him. Well ... I better go. You do not want to come? Everyone plays except you. Do not worry ... If you want. you come. Excuse me. there is someone who wants to talk to you. A child. My name is Hadji. Hadji Saa?ev. I was nine and a half. My father. my mother ?? s and my sister died. They were killed by Russian soldiers. I also have a little brother. Vakha. I should take care of him. but I have not succeeded. I am too small. Maybe if he is still alive. he will forgive me. We need you to tell your life before the war. Your story does not begin there. You lived with your parents and your brothers and sisters ?? s. before the war? Yes. You have memories with your parents? Yes. I remember one day my parents invited people. They sang and danced. they were laughing ... Everyone looked at the ... they danced very well. My father especially. ?? S my heart and I was proud of them. I am sure that they. too. they were proud of you. I do not know. It was my father who heard the soldiers arrive. He told us to hide. ?? s but my heart wanted to stay with him and my mother. I did as my father said. I hid with my brother. And I heard the soldiers screaming on my parents. And then they killed them. Once they are gone. I fled with my brother. But I did not know how feed him. So I had to leave the front of a house. But I know that in the house. it was not the Russians ... because I listened their voices first. Once on the road. people have taken me in their truck. They said I was lost ... and I could to live normally. But in truth. they know nothing. even if they are large. For example. they could not that I would meet you. They could not know. You are right. This is not because they are great. they know better than you. It is true that I abandoned my brother and also that I stole jewelry. but that does not mean I'm bad. I stole jewelry so we're even. Because it's always you who give me everything. and I nothing. I thought that it was good to do so. That's why I've stolen. Do not worry. Hadji. You were right. You know that it all is not your fault. Yes. Anyway. it was stupid woman. because her jewelry is Russians will eventually get them. So it is better that this either you who repartiez with. Kolya! Come with us! Hi. my brother! Okay? You've changed. whore! What you talking about? Guys. say hello to Kolya. This is my friend. my brother. damn! That's Vacia Igor. Cerega! Kolya. Nice To Meet You. Here. Okay. you? And you? How are you? And well there. there ... It is Paradise! Look! Cheers! Hello. Thank you for your attention. I'll tell you about a conflict happening right now. across Europe. in Chechnya. This war. planned since a while. began on September 5 by aviation attacks Russian on Chechen soil. followed by the entry of Russian troops in the territory. on 1 October 1999. This is indeed an armed conflict. and not an anti-terrorist operation as presented by the Russian authorities. Since mid-October. the troops Russian advance towards the south. Advanced accompanying their massive bombing without distinction between combatants ... and civilian population. For example. October 21. a missile exploded in Grozny. making more than 150 dead in a mosque. a market and a maternity ward. Grozny is now systematically and massively bombed ... Massively bombed round the clock ... despite the presence of more than 40 000 civilians. There seems to be no will target strikes. The only goals seem to be ... destruction ... destruction and death. No way out was offered to civilians wishing to leave the cities or bombed villages. In taking possession of a place. Russian troops widely practiced looting ... and extortion. Rape ... and summary executions are held almost systematically. The Russian military manufactures that the trauma and a need for vengeance that will not disappear for several generations ... if Europe does not act quickly. Would that for show Chechens that the world has not forgotten them. Finally. the Russians seem to want fully control the information. unlike the first Chechen war. This means that President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Putin will meet no opposition in Russia. So they have their hands totally free to act. We'll see why this war is a war and not a set anti-terrorist operations. Enter! I am going. I'm sorry. I hope you're not disappointed. No. Do not worry. Everybody respects your decision. Good luck. You will always be welcome. I apologize for the other day. - I was a little ... - No no ... I was exhausted and I'm happy you're here. - It gives me the opportunity to apologize. - No really ... You were right on many points. I understood that you meant. I thought only of myself. In fact. I came to you because I made an important decision. I'll offer me as a host family the child whose I told you. And I would like to the official procedure. You can help me? Well ... Where is he? He waits for me in the yard. Okay. We can see it? Of course. Hadji! Hadji ... What is happening? Nothing. Hello Hadji. You have a car? Yes. You can come with me? Why? I will explain. Okay. Let it go. Raisa! Hadji! Come On! Come On! Come On! Damn ... Damn. why it does not work? Why does it not work? What a con ... There ... Welcome. Welcome a big country of shit. fuck ... Chechnya. whore. Well. there he goes not much ... because it happens a little after the battle. But I'll try to find people. Well. finally now. you see a little crappy mood in this country. damn. Ah. I see the world out there. we will be closer. Translated From French to English by Sina-Khorramdarreh.
