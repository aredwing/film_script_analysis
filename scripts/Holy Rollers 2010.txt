Ruth, watch your brother. I will, mama. Thank you. Yes. Shmuel. Don't be intimidated by her. The lazars are a family. Maybe they have a few more dollars than we have. Maybe they have a stove that actually works. They're just a family, like us, all right? [ indistinct conversations ] I see the two children were playing? Maybe too much sugar? Take yankel. He has to wash his hands. Zei gezunt. Go take a walk. Hi. Happy hanukkah. I got you a present. Elka: Oh, I'm not so sure! [ laughs ] Lehayim. Lehayim. You're gonna be a good rabbi, shmuel. Elka: One more time. Let's try it. Let's see. Maybe I should continue to work with you. Nah. We talked about it. I could make more gelt with you. That's a good idea. Why? Why is it such a good idea? Why? What have I taught you, shmuel? He -- the man who immerses himself In a desire for money is always -- Remember that, always -- in debt. I don't understand why it's such a bad thing To make a little gelt. Yeah, I don't want to marry a poor man. Ah, bubeleh, you'll be lucky If any man marries you with that pisk. Mendel! Well, she -- she -- She has a lot of chutzpah to talk -- okay. Pass the latkes. Okay. Woman: Every single piece of fabric that I own Comes from this store. I know that. That's why I'm not profiting on this deal. Look, ma'am, your daughter will have a beautiful dress Made from the finest silk in thailand, all right? You know, I don't even want to deal with you. Where's mendel? Mendel -- mendel's not here right now. I'm sorry. He's not here? Mendel! Go to another store on this block. They deal in cheap, shoddy material. Mendel! Look who's here!

Look, ma'am, all right, I'll do 75% silk, I'm sorry. That's it. Just -- just go get it. Go get it. Yeah. Go get it. I hope you'll treat your wife better than this box. You let her off too easy, tateh. She has money. She's loyal. Eh, it's -- it's worth a couple of nickels. What have I taught you? Be nice, charge little -- you'll get a lot of customers. You think gloria's at home singing about how great you are? You need to draw a line somewhere. Your customers are gonna walk all over you. Shmuel gold. What? This is my store, and I run it my way. When you become a rabbi, I'm not gonna shove my nose in your business, all right? Did you get your allowance? Yeah, mama gave it to me. Here. Take it, take it, take it, take it. It's a little something extra between me and you. Shaynem dank, tateh. [ both speaking hebrew ] Woman: That means you can go and get your lovers. Go ahead. Get your lovers. I'll wait. If you all are just tuning in... Get out of here. Hey. Get out of here! Mama, ruth left the bathroom window open again. It's freezing. Stop utzing me. You were supposed to take the garbage out. It's shabbos. And it smells! Don't let anyone see you, especially your father! [ toy squeaks ] Huh? Where you going? Thank god your father's not here to see this. [ indistinct shouting ] Don't worry so much, ma! Wait. Gut shabbos. And merry hanukkah to you, too! There's my samelah. Did you see the tits on that girl on tv? Maybe. Maybe? You know they're fake, right? What do you mean? Well, sometimes -- What are you doing? You're smoking on shabbos now? Yeah, put that out. It's shabbos. Dank. You think he listens to me? Please.

Let's go. Mazel. Mazel, sammy. What's her name, huh, sammy? Vanna? Huh? Vanna white? No. You ever see that show? I made sure he didn't, thank you very much. The best show ever! You got to watch it! It's the greatest! Ay, shaineh maidel. Don't stare. Don't stare. You're the one staring. I'm not staring. Hey, sammy, let me ask you -- Do you even know what to do with a beautiful girl? The rebbe will tell me. Gut shabbos. Goodbye. The rebbe will tell you? Yes. What's the rebbe gonna tell you? The rebbe's not gonna tell you how to please your wife. Would you stop it? Don't listen to him. He's fine. He's jealous. What am I jealous of, leon, huh? Jealous of marrying a girl I don't even know? My tateh says it's time for us to get married. We will be happy. Baruch hashem. Goodbye. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, baruch hashem. Very confident. Mr. Lazar! Hey, mr. Lazar! [ indistinct shouting ] Get off of me! Get off of me! Come on, get off of me, you fucking fag. Get off. Get out of here. Run to shul, little girls. Go home! They heard hashem's voice moving in the garden With the wind of day. The man and his wife hid themselves from hashem Among the trees of the garden. Hashem called to the man, And he said, "where are you?" Did hashem know where adam was hiding? Shmuel? Shmuel? God being god knew where adam was hiding, But the question is for adam to answer. All men must answer this. They must know where they stand In relation to hashem's presence. Either you move closer... Or further away. Your friend is very wise with the talmud. He could be a good rabbi. But we're not here to talk about leon. We're here to talk about you. I think I'd prefer to work with my father. I see. Judaism is about community. It's about looking outward to others, Not just looking inward at yourself. Farshteyn. Farshteyn. I don't want to be a burden to my family or the community. Very well. Very well. I have given my blessing for the first bashert. You have? I pray the meeting goes in your favor. You'll be a husband and a father before you know it. Thank you, rebbe. A shaynem dank. Only then will you find true joy And all this will become clear. Will you study at the koel? Yes, well, I-I work in manhattan now. I'm not sure about becoming a rabbi yet. You like playing basketball more? You've seen me? No, no. No. No. My tateh will talk to the rabbi. They will decide for me. What job do you do? I take care of my younger brothers and sisters. Oh. That's nice. How many children? [ clock chiming ] Five? No, I want eight. Eight? Baruch hashem. Baruch hashem. Which yeshiva would they attend? Eight? Wow. Sammy. Come over here for a second. It's freezing out, huh? Yeah. I'm sorry I gave you shit about your marriage the other day. That's okay. I'm not even married yet. Yeah. So, where are you gonna live, huh? You gonna live with your parents? Mazel, is that a rolex? Shh, shh! Leon's a fucking mensch. You know that. [ chuckles ] Working for the medical business now. For a doctor? Yeah, sort of.

Sam: Well, she was more nervous than me. Did her parents say anything yet, or...? No, not yet. No? Oh, oh, what were you and yose talking about before? Nothing, nothing. His new business. Yose doesn't have a business. Well, he offered me a job. Are you meshugga? You work for yosef? Yeah, he offered me $1,000 to import medicine from europe. Maybe I should do it for zeldy. That doesn't make sense. There's no medicine work that type of gelt. No, no, it's special. It's -- it's for rich people. But, listen, I won't go unless you go with me. Why didn't he ask me? I've never been to europe. That's where our grandparents came from. Oh, I got it, mama. I got it. No, no. No, no. Hey. Stop, stop, stop. Don't hurt yourself. All right, here. Go tell your tateh that yankel should be in bed already. One second. There we go. What's wrong? Nothing. Mama, something's wrong. Tell me. Nothing. It's the stove. Mama. Go get your father. What's the matter? Just -- he made me a promise. The lazars have started to look for another marriage. I'm sorry, my boychik. And the old lady said... [ high-pitched voice ] "thank you for not stealing the apples! Thank you for asking!" And she gave him a whole basket. Now, the tired traveler -- and he wasn't just a traveler. Remember, he was a rabbi. He was famous. He was a miracle maker. Have you heard any news? Shh. He said to the -- to the lady -- he said -- Tateh...Why won't they let her marry me? Is it because of our family? [ sighs ] Just -- just keep on studying, okay? Just keep on studying. Don't worry. Focus on your studies. We'll find you a good bride. Okay. All right? Come. Pray with your brother and me. Uh, no. [ clears throat ] No. I have a cold. I don't want him to catch it. [ indistinct conversation ] Fuck! What the fuck is he doing here?! No, he comes with me.

What's medicine here might not mean "medicine" there. What's medicine there might not mean "medicine" here. Farshteyn? No, not farshteyn. What's wrong with the medicine? Yose, yose, could we get in trouble? Yosef: Guys, guys, calm down. Don't worry so much. Just think of it as a game.
