You can be a Self-Defense Forces junior cadet until 17. It's okay. Let's do that. After that, I want to work at a regular airline. I like planes. I'd like to ride in it. How beautiful. Where should we go? I can't go alone with you. My sister's very strict about that. Why? I guess she had some kind of experience. - What kind of experience? - I don't know. Then what if some friends come with us? - Friends? - Yeah, a couple friends. Okay? Then it's fine, right? Married couples and marriage... Looking at my father and mother, I get a vague idea how I might be at their age. Sounds boring. So I don't see married life as something terribly beautiful. How to put it? He's younger, but he's experienced, and now he's quit school. You're mean! Let's stop talking about boyfriends. It's horrible! Really? If so, then I'll lend you my car. I like girls with long legs. Legs this long. Why? I want to fool around with a sexy girl. - No, soon it'll... - You're terrible! No! I don't! - Oh, boy! - She's blushing. A half over here. Let me borrow this. People catch snakes because snakes like sake. And they're always cold, so they keep sake chilled. I heard snakes are useless that way. Girls don't eat a whole lot, but they're scary. They fight over sweet rolls and strawberries. How's Shi-chan? - She quit her job. She's getting married. - She was really nice. - Are these plastic flowers? - They look so real. We've been writing for four years. He lives in Aomori. He has a good personality, but he's not very tall. Morning dreams are prophetic. Night dreams are the opposite of the truth. I want to see the sequel to my dreams. NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS Just as there are happy mornings Sometimes there are sad, sad nights I lent you 20 yen the other day, right? Guys, empty your pockets. Let's see how much we've got. Let's hold hands on a night like this - How much did we blow? - 360 yen on the three curry rice, six colas were 240, and popcorn was 120... 720 yen altogether. So we've only got 1,280 yen left. We're just about broke. So where are we going? Well, where should we go? - Where are we heading? - That way. I don't like this. It's our only day off. Right, we're out for a drive. Let's have as much fun as we can. - Stop that. - What are you doing? She wants it. Stop it. Where are we going? Don't worry. You don't even know, do you? Of course not. We don't have a map. You really don't know? Anywhere's okay, as long as it's far away. Even my mother doesn't do housework. I liked him, so I was happy. You'll find out when you live together. - When you fall in love... - So you are in love. Love makes you aware of disliking or disconnecting... That's right. He and I just sort of left. Sex is like God. After all, from the moment you're born, you're all alone. I have to push myself harder. I even show the sword's blade penetrating flesh. That's why my manga are for adults. The tough part is the ending. All my manga have been turned down because they had weak endings. It would be a blast if we could drive for two or three days. Let's go where we can see the ocean. I think we're near the ocean. I'd like to go someplace high up. There's a mountain too. I got dressed in bed. I had a great dream this morning. I was holding a washbowl... What kind of dream? I don't remember, but I wanted to go back to sleep and keep dreaming. That's a second helping you're having. You paid 100 yen for that, right? That's so irresponsible! Where's the dustpan? And the broom? Isn't that the ocean there? There's a lighthouse. I love the night sea. I can't see anything. It's pitch-black. - We'll catch some fish. - Funny. The light blinks at fixed intervals and tells you the lighthouse's location. How long's the interval? One, two, three, four, five... about six seconds. Then it's in San Francisco! Damn! I'm so sleepy! I'm too scared to sleep. I'm awake, but I feel like I'm dreaming. I want this dream to go on... because night dreams are the opposite of the truth.
