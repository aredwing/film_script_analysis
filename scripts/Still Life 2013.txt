Coming up to two months now. Just the one? Just Mr Sandberg, thank you. We'll give the others a little more time. You never know. - Morning Mr May. - Morning Mr White. They're piling up in there Mr May. I'm just expecting some news of Mr Radulovitz and Mrs Casement. I'm very optimistic. Mr Radulovitz has been on the shelf two good months. What about the others? Come the summer they'll be sharing bunks. We do have leads, not every door is shut. There may still be someone. She was found two days ago. Someone saw the cat in the street, bleeding. "To my little Suzie, happy birthday, Mum" I was told there was no family. No, for ten years I've never seen anyone. Postmark is last year Monday, went to the shops. Bought some fish. Tuesday, shops. It's all the same. "Dear Mum, thank you so much for my wonderful present". Does she have a daughter? "Please write again soon. Love you with all my heart..." Susie. Susie's the cat. Look. It's from the Cat. Signed with a little paw. Some people, eh? Please call these people. Anything they won't take can be thrown away. London Borough of Kennington Client Services, John May speaking. Mr Radulovitz? Yes, and you are... Mr Radley. And your connection with Mr... His son? But your sur... You've changed it? Right, right! Thank you very much for calling. Great, just, just wonderful. Unfortunately, as you know your father has passed away. Yes. Died six weeks ago. Well you were contac... Actually in this office we're charged with tracing the relatives of those who passed away in the Borough and failing... Yes, your father... No, no, no, there's no obligation for the next of kin to pay for the funeral. No, you don't. Indeed... There is no obligation to attend, but... If I may say so, I understand, Mr Radul... I mean... Mr Radley. Your father, Mr Radulovitz, might not have been... the best of fathers, but if I... What do I? My family? No, I don't have... But surely, now that he's passed away his children should... But you've found a father after all these years... I would... Wouldn't you want your children, his grandchildren, to know? It's not too late. No, I know he's dead, but... You're right I wouldn't know. And would you be able to think of anyone who might have had contact? Someone who might at least want to be present at the funeral. No. And you, y-you would... No. Very well Mr Radulovitz. I'm sorry, Mr Radley. I understand. Thank you. Goodbye. Case Closed. Who says it's my dog? Recognize his piss? That dog is always out here. Always I only have to open my door and it rushes in my house. Are you some sort of dog piss expert? Have a look up the wall. Look how high it is. I've only got a little dog. If you would just keep your dog on a leash... I would like to confirm that a package addressed to Miss Dawn Harvey... What was in it? Why do you need to know? Ashes. Ashes, the ashes of Mr George Harvey. What kind of ashes? Excuse me, am I speaking to Australia Post, Yeperenye shopping centre, 13 Cactus Street, Alice Springs? What else, let me see. He has a blue paw, and there's a grey mark on him... Ah now, this could help. There's a... He has a tattoo on his right ear of... Well as I said, we found the dog next to the body... I mean, in the apartment of Mr Didion. And we thought that someone involved with dog racing might know the dog, and therefore the owner. We are here to celebrate the life of Jane Ford. A woman who enjoyed life for all it could bring. She was born in the summer of 1945, as peace finally came to the world, in Scarborough. The only daughter of Jack and Nora Ford. And what a joy it must have been for them to hold her. The lovely, maybe unexpected, fruit of a rare reunion in those turbulent times. She grew to enjoy what life most readily offered. The warmth of a sunny day at the beach, a simple yet tasteful necklace, a new stick of red lipstick. She was passionate about dance, flamenco in particular and always looked gorgeous when stepping out on the dance floor in her red dress. Later in life, a love of animals made her care for her sweet cat Susie with whom she shared many happy years. Always celebrating Christmas together in great style. Just you again, Mr May. Afraid so. Six in this one already, this is the last one. Got yourself a cracking spot there Mr May. By the time it's your turn those branches will be shading anyone who comes to visit ya. It's good to plan this kind of thing. Uncle Fred ended up in Surbiton. I'm sure he wouldn't have liked that one bit. London Borough of Kennington, Client Services. Good afternoon, Mr Huxley. Very well, thank you. Found... today. No point of contact. Yes, I will go this afternoon. And the address? The neighbours complained about the smell. The police said it must have been weeks. I didn't really know him. Bit of a loner, you know the type. So you live opposite, eh? Did you know him? No, I didn't know him. I only get involved if there's a problem. Boiler... Something like that. You better wear these. I can't see a record player. He probably sold it for a couple of drinks. What about that eh! Time stops for no one. Here he is. Billy Stoke. I can't say I recognize him. They all look the same don't they? Call the Health Department. They need to clean and clear this place as soon as possible. Except for the Carriage clock. That goes to the Pawnbrokers in the High Street. Thank you. Thank you very much. Goodbye now. No family again Mr May? - Maybe. - Mr May! Mr Pratchett. Could I see you in my office please? As I said, your Department is being amalgamated with that of the Dulwich office. Here represented by Miss Pilger. And from today the Coroner is referring all cases to the new office. Dulwich? - I guess I could buy a bicycle. - Ah, no. You don't understand. You won't need to travel, that's the point. Given the current pressure on finances the Council is undertaking a new round of efficiency savings. We're letting you go. - You're letting me go? - Mr May, in the two months I've been here I've been able observe you at work and there's no doubt you are very thorough. But if I may say so you're also very slow. Not to say expensive given the number funerals you choose to organize as opposed to cremations. There were no indications of religi... John, you've been with the Council now for how long? - Twenty two years. - Twenty two years? Well, I think you should see this as an opportunity for a new beginning, don't you? A new life I'm sure the Council's references will enable you to find new and challenging work. A job where people are alive, for a change? What about this morning's case? This morning? Ah yes, that'll be your last one. Please close it in three days. Should be the right size Sorry about this, you know... Health rules. I understand. I also have to wear this stuff at work sometimes. You're in food processing too then? Baking? Baking? No, not really baking. I'm actually a... Well, I only have to wear this when I see people. People? Yes, I mean people... who don't bake anymore. Billy... Billy Stoke. Worst player in the team. Nobody would dare kick him out. Bloody temper. Hear that? Managed to fight both Management and Union reps about the afternoon break. He won us 5 extra minutes then dropped off, just packed it in. But before he does that, what does he do? Pisses in a vat of pork meat. Some of the batch got through. Pies never tasted so good. Here, have one. Thank you, I don't smoke. We found this... in his home. Do you know who she might be? No idea. Looks a bit like him. - Daughter, maybe? - Yes. That's what I think. Would be nice to give it to her if she was still alive. He must have loved her. Funny though. Never mentioned a family. We were best mates really... for a time. Like school kids you know, just... Older. He was like my older brother. Then Billy met the "Fish & Chips" lady in Whitby and... - he left to be with her. - Whitby? Would you know her name? Her address maybe? No sorry, only saw her a couple of times. Lovely girl though. Billy always had a way with the ladies. Something about him... Always on the edge. I don't know... Do you understand women? There will be a funeral, in a few days time in London. - Would you consider coming? - To the funeral? I don't know. I mean it would be good to have a drink with him but... A funeral. After so long. You miss that train next time and I won't be waiting. - Yeah you will, you want me too much. - Ha! Don't you count on it! I might have a better offer. Bollocks! You'll never find anyone who loves you as much as I do. Yeah? And how much do you love me then? Well, I love you more than you love me, that's for sure. - A black tea please. - You should try the hot chocolate. Just got this new machine. It's gorgeous. Alright. A hot chocolate please. The train now departing from platform 3, is the 12:30 service for London St. Pancras. Hello, Mr Pratchett. Yes, it's John May. John May, Client Services. Yes I know, I'm sorry. I haven't been feeling myself today. No, still not quite right. I don't think I will be in tomorrow. Yes, yes. Of course. Goodbye Mr Pratch... Just put them on top of the others. When he were good he were wonderful. Very kind and loving... When he were bad... you got out the room. Just half a sack in the peeler and then pull the switch above your head. The one on the left. When they're done. In the chipper. And don't put you hands in if you like your fingers. I can only tell about his life here with me. He never spoke about his life before. He could give you so much just in a day, you didn't want to be anywhere else but with him. Do you know what I mean? It was me who asked him to move in. He worked a while on the boats. That went, thanks to those fools in Brussels. So he started helping out in here. He were good at it. Put extra beer in the batter. Customers were happy. It were nice to have him around all day. Strange job you've got. All those lives... I couldn't do it. I like my work. - You got the paper? - Oh hell, I forgot. Give me a minute. Mind the child, will you? Bit early for another inspection. Had the last one mid-summer. No, no. I'm here to find people who were friends maybe for a man who was here 20 years ago. William Stoke? Him? You won't find any friends of his round here. What's he done now? Killed somebody? No, actually he died a few weeks ago. Well, good riddance. Wasn't all there if you ask me. Fried a man alive he did. This guy were faffing with Mary. Billy gets vexed, lands him one. So the guy picks up a knife. Billy grabbed his arm. Shoves it in the fryer up to here, and holds it there, knife and all. Mad I tell you. - Says here it should be paid in June. - Hello. - Good morning. - Ah, don't worry about that love. We'll sort that out. Did you miss mummy? Were just telling him about when Billy fried that guy. Mad eh? Don't forget we promised mum we'd take her to the Bingo. Don't listen to him Billy were cleared, completely. But he wasn't the same after that. He started drinking a lot. Became impossible, even with me. And after a while he just upped and left. We found this in his room. Do you recognize her? Did he ever speak of a family? No, he never spoke of having a family. He did leave something behind but he never knew about it. Shift ends at 4:30, so see you then. - Bye love! - Bye. Bye. Miss Jones, there'll be a funeral, Billy's funeral. In a few days in London. You must come. Bring his daughter, and his granddaughter. - It's one... - I'm sorry, it's not possible. But... you're his family. We're not his family. He didn't want one. And I can't. It's too long ago, it's too much to explain. - The Council could help with transport. - I loved him. Never loved anyone else since, but I can't. Please don't insist. Do you know where he might have moved on to when he left? No idea. Prison most likely. - Good morning Mr White. - Mr May. What news from the land of the living? Friar in Robin Hood's band, 4 letters. - Tuck. - Tuck! You're wasted here Mr May. Mastermind, big leather chair, that's where you belong. - I'd give it a go if I were you. - Mr White. Our last case, William Stoke. Row 2, tray 8. 40 days rotting, I believe. 40? Well he won't have to wait any longer. If you can get him ready please. Oh, they've just taken another three for cremation this afternoon. There's a lot more checking out than checking in these days. I'll be out of a job soon. Here, Mr May... Flightless bird, 4 letters. Dodo. D-O-D-O. Dodo, I never heard of it. You're revving Mr May! Another fruitful day, John? Almost there? Mr Pratchett. Miss Pilger tells me of great progress John, The Council's very pleased I'm sure you'll be pleased in turn with the references I am preparing. Thank you. You see it wasn't that difficult after all. - Sorry? - Well, you have to think about this. Your job. And let's face it, the dead are dead. The funerals are for the living. So if there's no one there, there's no one to care, right? I mean, for the living... Could be better not to know. You know, no funeral... No sadness, no tears. What do you think? I can't say that I've ever thought of it that way, Mr Pratchett. Well anyway, the dead are dead. They're not there, they don't care. Alright? Mr Pratchett! - Yes, John? - Mr Pratchett! - I need a few more days. - More days? I'm afraid that won't be possible John. - The Council has already... - My last case, William Stoke. John, there's really no need for you. Miss Pilger can sort it. It'll only take a few days. Right, alright. But it'll have to be in your own time. Your termination notice has already been signed, and the Council can't re-issue it, Ok? Of course. I understand, Mr Pratchett. No, no, no. We have no knowledge of an actual conviction. But you see Mr Stoke was on a... a particular trajectory. I think mostly short spells, vagrancy... assaults, that sort of thing, but uhm... - No trouble inside. - And you have no record of any visitors? No, we sent the old logs off the to the Metropolitan archive. - And they can't find them there. - Well you could try the Home Office. But you know, we're talking about 20 years ago. - It's 17, actually. - Mr May if we have to remember what happenes to every man whose walked through here we wouldn't get much sleep at night. And I like my sleep. I'll tell you one thing. Your Billy once hung over the edge of the 3rd floor landing from a belt with his teeth. Three and a half minutes. He was raising money for some charity. All the lads put a few quid in. - His teeth? - Yes, his teeth. How about that then? Goodbye Mr May. Yes? Kelly Stoke? Sorry? You're not Kelly Stoke? - Sorry? - The daughter of William Stoke? Yeah. Sorry, who are you? I'm John May. Kennington Borough Council. - Kennington? - I have some sad news I'm afraid. Your father has died. When? Well it's hard to say exactly. Why? Because... I don't want to know. Thank you. Miss Stoke... There is this. I found it in his flat. He never even wrote. I was so angry. Still am again. Then one day it was my birthday, 18. He called. He didn't mention my birthday. He must've know. He must have, don't you think? Yes of course. Of course he knew. He remembered. Well he was in prison, drunk. Or so it sounded. He'd hit rock bottom, and... he wanted to square things before he got out so he could start again. Mum wasn't sure, but we still went though. Almost didn't recognize him. But he knew who I was. And I had changed, you know, in eight years. - But he knew, as soon as I walked in. - Yeah, yeah. Only, as soon as he turned round... It all came out. I don't know where from. We just started about... Mum, him leaving us... How selfish he was. Then he started shouting because... Billy Stoke never backed down in the face of a row, did he? It was horrible. The Guard had to come over. And then, he punched the Guard in the face, turned round, walked out the door... and I never saw him again. There's Dad with Jumbo. Both Paras, in the Falklands. They were best mates. He got in touch with me about... ten years ago. Wanted to find to find Dad. I couldn't help him, but he sent me that anyway. No, take it. I don't need it, I mean... I don't know why I kept it really. Miss... Fine, nothing, really. It's just uhm... It's just the shock. I must ask... your mother, is she... She's dead. Quite peacefully, and someone with her. Too early though. Three years ago. So an orphan as of today. Yes. That's not nice... - Whenever it happens. - No. I should go. I am very grateful for your time. Thank you. Thank you for coming to tell me. Of course. And you have my number... if you decide to involve yourself any further. The funeral... - And I've arranged a... - Please Mr May, don't say any more. You've already said such a lot. Excuse me, your door! Your door! Your door! John May. I thought I heard you coming down the corridor. Young folks steps, not many of them round here. Come in, I'm Jumbo. - Very pleased to meet you Jumbo. - Made you some dinner, I hope it's out. Some tea there just brewed. Pour yourself a cup and sit down. Eat. Thank you. Very much. Alright? Yes, thank you. Perfect. So... Billy's daughter told you about me. I remember her voice... Must be a lovely girl, gentle. Yes. Gentle. Didn't get that from her father. Knocked my bloody head in, in my first day in the Army. Wouldn't be here now though, if it wasn't for him. Didn't leave me on that bloody mountain. The Falklands? Right. Fuckin' place. You've been in the Army? Me? No. No, I haven't. That's worst of our lives, the Paras. They picked the meanest bastards, they didn't... When I found him again, he was on the streets, a dosser. Mind you, he only slept in the poshest places. Barclay Square, Green Park. No King's Cross for him. The drink... helps you forget. Helps you to sleep without dreaming. Then it gets inside you and it won't come out. It's awful when you think about it. Killing a man. - And you? You stayed on? - No. As soon as I got out of hospital, came down to London. Tried settling down. Even got married. What a day that was! Fell asleep in the church. We met at a dance. She was hiding behind the pillars, pretending not to look. Two left feet, lovely! They were the days. It's alright Officer. Just here havin' a think, that's all. - He's not the law, he's from St. Jude's. - St. Jude yeah? Still tryin' to turn us off drink for a soup? What happen? They used to send pretty birds to convince us. - What? We're not worth it now? - I'm from Kennington Borough. I'm looking for people who might have known a man called William Stoke. Billy Stoke. - I'm told he used to come here often. - Billy Stoke, you mean Big Billy. - What's with him? - Actually he passed away a few weeks ago. Weeks? Well, we ain't seen him for months. - Years even. - What is it you want to know? I'd like to know what he was like. - What acquaintances he... - Yeah? Well information like that's worth the price of a drink. D'you think? Bottle of whiskey please. Wood's. The large one. That's what I call a drink! Good man! Thanks. Sit down, sit down You'll give us a toe neck. Big Billy... - He was the worst beggar. - Hold on a minute. Here, have a red one. They're good. No, thank you. I haven't eaten. He was outlinging it, see. The punters felt it, they never stopped. It was Lesley who got him the drink. He would have been sober without her. Lesley? - We were all mad for her, really. - I weren't. But out the crew she picked Billy. The only one who didn't pester her. - I didn't. - You did! God, do you remember the time he nicked the chocolate for her? It was all melted, he... He's all... caked in it, all covered in this... Sticky chocolate. Oh yeah, he got 3 months for that. Just for chocolate. Do you know where I can find Lesley? Bone yard. Good funeral though. Lovely lady, good drink after. You know, they never seemed to talk. They just sat there on a bench together. Well that's what we all want, isn't it? A woman to be quiet with. K, G... This one here, G-93485 93485, right. Good views. Aren't they? Lovely. And you would like to... I'd like to make it available for someone else. Family member? No family. Just a friend. London Borough of Kennington Client Services. John May speaking. Yes. Miss Stoke, of course. Eleven? Not Plymouth, but two stops before Plymouth. Off platform 2. Yes, I'm sure I'll find it. Thank you very much Miss Stoke. I mean, Kelly. Thank you, Kelly. See you tomorrow. I thought this piece here... It really has something. I'm sure it's never been used in a funeral before but you'll see... I mean, you'll hear. When you hear it, next Friday. And... Ah yes, the memorial. They call it red granite but it's not red, it's darker. More maroon, it's like the colour of his beret in the Army. I thought your father would have liked that. And the place, I really hope you like it, it's... Well, on a good day you can see for miles. And even when the weather is not that great. It's so open, you really feel you've got, you really feel... I mean he is, he is outside. He's not inside. Not under I was thinking next Friday, after the service. Maybe we could go somewhere for a cup of tea or chocolate? Just to, you know... Just to chat. If you have time of course, if you... Yes. Yes, I would like that very much. Just a cup of... something, and I do have time. I have lots of time. See you there then, John. And thank you. Thank you for everything you've done. No need. It was... just my job.
