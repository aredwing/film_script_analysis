I don't know, shit... See? Look at the mountains. And there's a mountain... oh and next to it, another mountain. Mountains... Something wrong? Why aren't you jumping? Are you scared? What's your name little boy? Adam. My mum's lost. Fly Adam, fly... Good. Just remember in the future Adam, skis always together. ATTENTION! ADAM MALYSZ'S RARENTS ARE ASKED TO COME TO INFORMATION DESK. In order to learn you have to fall. THE FUTURE CREATED TODAY WILL BE OUR PRESEN It's a little stuffy here. You had to be the one to drive those tramps out into the field. Bye. Bronek's the best for the trunk. Polish Roulette Thanks. Want to buy cash? I'll take it. Do you have a lot? Three and a half grand over there. I'll take it all. Bit of poker? - But we need to be up in the morning. - Okay! Just one hand. Take it easy on me. Please... - A little vodka, a baby beer? - A drop of wine. - Eighty... and over eighty. - Fuck. Traditionally before we deal. What's the ante? How much? As much as you want. Here we are Janek playing cards... in the warmth... and there outside the border Russian tanks are fuelled. Will have to get away across the border. I'm going to stay. I'll fight with the occupant. Ante for 100 grand. I raise you 300. Maybe they won't get in... It's hard to say. Two Fiats 125. Call. Three. How many? Three please. All in. I didn't give. Thank you very much. How come? Like so. We agreed on one hand. ...politics, there's never an end to it. It was nice. I bid you a farewell. You saw him switch up the deck? I didn't see anything. So how did you cut? The cards were cold. When I cut them they were warm. To play, you really need to know how. People gamble to lose. Well, you played the famous Buzka. He's scum. He's in with the Ministry of Public Security. How else would he be able to keep turning the roulette wheel in Zakopane and Sopot for so many years. Do you know that toff? No. He looks like a tosser. Let's stop over in Cracow. I want to visit a friend. Who is it? Markiz. I don't know him. Good guy, gone a little crazy. What's up with him? He paints. In the looney bin? THE FRUITS OF LABOUR OF A BEEHIVE ALL FOR THE HOMELAND. I paint sets in the theatre and at home I try to create real art. I've finally given my life some meaning. Can you live off it? I've discovered a new world. I've become a different person. I've become addicted to the need to create, do you understand? I notice things, that I never realised before. Do you know how lucky it is to be able to earn your living doing something you enjoy? I also have that. I've closed myself off. I'm not interested in any swindles. Shifty numbers don't interest me. Markiz. We came to visit you. - Yeah? - Yes. That's very interesting. Meet Ludwik. He's my best friend. Good day. He taught me to paint. Just fix up the throne and you can go home. Yes Boss. It was in... in Gdansk opposite Leningrad cinema, there was a milk bar like that... ...Ruczaj. - Ah yes, Ruczaj. - It's still there. - Still there? Fuck, really. Well, there, you'd first pay at the till then give the card to the cook. She'd shout the order to the kitchen, then shout at the room for the customer who'd placed the previous order. For example "An order of lazy dumplings! Pick up your pancakes!". I'd hang around at the side and pick up one order, then the next. And what did the customer who paid for it do? He'd pick up the lazy dumplings meant for the next customer. No, thank you. Actually, I'll have red wine please. Dry. Yes of course Doctor. Doctor Gourmet. You can crash at mine. Where are you going to drive at night? And what about some ladies perhaps? That would be nice. Eryk said you'd gone crazy, but I see you're normal. There you go. Can you have two wines delivered to that table. Why yes of course, sir. Go sweet talk. He's good. Out of every ten he pulls six. I also used to have a pretty good average. Go... You can't win them all, but you have to try. Hi there, my friend and I over there... You have beautiful skin you know? Wash your face in the morning and then wipe it with water and lemon juice. Where to get a lemon? Christmas is coming up, they should throw some in. And what do you suggest for chapped lips? Put honey on your lips overnight. You'll see how soft they'll be in the morning. They're pretty good, hey? Thank you very much. There will now be a short intermission. Thank you ever so much, sir. What a little rat... Food was included and he didn't subtract it. Thief... and he added the coleslaws separately. Hey, and what's this? That could be his date of birth. Could you come over here for a moment, champ? Why of course, sir. My friend paid you well? Why evervthing is in perfect order is it not, sir? He didn't make a mistake? No, erm... let me check. May I? That's with a tip. Aren't you embarrassed? For such lovely service. Let me add to that, from me, two bundles... - You really don't need to, sir. ... it's deserved. - 100, 200. - Thank you so much. Thank you and I apologise for my friend. Always at your service! Well then... fed and watered... let's go. Hey sucker... - Eh come on. - What's up? - It's a guy. - Who? Victoria. Who's afraid of the wolf doesn't stroll in the woods. If you weren't so shy... You bender! Get out of here! Take that and get out! I could do it in a way you wouldn't even notice... - Goodbye lady! - Yes, lady. - Get out. - Let go, get your hands off. Well, can you imagine? What are you laughing at? You kissed a guy. Oh fuck. - You knew! - What? - That Victoria is a guy. - Victoria? That's Victor! A wolf in sheep's clothing. I don't believe it. I met her today... - Did you grab her by... - She had breasts. And balls. Sonny, what will happen when people find out you caught a Vic by his dick? - Matejko! - Give us a few zloty and I won't tell anyone. Out on one field an ox searches for grass, a dog for a hare and a stork for a frog... The pound? It's Victor... With flowers. Did you order a Tartar, Sonny? The secret police came for me. At home, in the theatre... They wanted to arrest me. Militia, the army everywhere. There's tanks in the streets, armed vehicles. Ludwik, calm down. They chased me... I sat on the roof for a few hours... and later I ran through back gardens. Life is like a sauna, the higher you sit the more you sweat. I announce, that today the Military Council of National Salvation was formed. The Council of state, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, introduced today at midnight martial law throughout the country. Martial law! I want everybody to understand the motives and goals of our actions. - There's a war. - There's beer? What? What war? With who? Watch and listen boy. The nation has enough strength and enough wisdom to develop an efficient democratic... - So he ended up making the decision. - Who decided? What? And, who are you? ...armed forces will be able to stay where their place is, in barracks. - So maybe I should leave in this situation. - Wait, wait, wait. ...can not in the long run be solved through violence. There's no signal. You have to get out of Cracow. Will you help me? Give me your ID. Only don't tell them who I am. Oh, they're not interested in politics, only in making money. They live in a different world. I'll bring you some clothes. Markiz, do you know someone who could sort out some petrol? Of course. What are you painting? You don't know? I'm trying to express myself. But what are you painting? Well, you know art is the only reason for living in this world... It gives life a purpose. Great, but what are you painting? - Ludwik, come. - Excuse me. He won't say. Learn it off by heart. Go with them, they're sane guys. I can only have trouble with them. If I tell them to get you to Warsaw, then even if it's burning... You won't convince me. I'm taking the train. I'll wait until it calms down and I'll get away abroad. And what are you going to do there? I have a few ideas. I might even go to work. But why do you want to leave? Because they have evervthing out there. Like what for example? Brothels... They have dozens of television channels. Can you imagine? How do you know? A sailor told me. They have casinos... We have them too... well, militia casinos. They also have something money can't buy. You can buy evervthing. They have freedom. I knew this would happen. Wave to them. You really do need luck in life. You are not normal. - Roadside check. - Good morning. - Where are you citizens heading? - We're driving home officer. - Where's home? - Sopot. Do you have a permit allowing for a change of location? - We're coming back from a holiday in Zakopane. - Do you have a permit? But I didn't know we needed one... In that case there'll be trouble. Unfortunately. ID please. Officer, I know this is your job, but you don't earn a lot. Plus, this martial law. There's nothing in shops, but you can always buy something at the Pewex. Some cognac perhaps. I'm sure you have a family. - Bribery? - What bribery? Of an officer on duty? Oh no, we make an arrangement, and I agree, that it's a gift. No such thing. I'm not getting into this. Absolutely not. Besides there's three of us. You're suggesting...? Listen. I used to be a district policeman in Warsaw. I know people. I'm a good psychologist, I have an eye, and what's more important, a nose for things. I can tell what you smell like. Is that what a normal citizen smells like? Besides I can see how you're dressed. I'd say it's worth 1500 dollars. Oh now you've gone too far. No. We have a war. If I lock you up now it could take over a month before it might turn out that you're not wanted. And your money they'll take anyway... Fine, let it be 1000. I don't have any more. That doesn't divide by three. Unfortunately. - 1200 and not a cent... - I'll take it. One moment. Give me 1200 dollars in cash. And prepare a bundle. Unfortunately. Good morning. Count it. - 1150. - Yeah? Well, I wanted to leave some for petrol. In Poland petrol costs a zloty... And this doesn't divide by three. Officers, what guarantee do I have that you won't tell your friends down the road also to stop us? Will you give me your word of honour? - Word of honour. - Word of honour. Documents. Oh fuck... after them! Drive. I will show that bloody asshole, fuck him! They're after us? Then why did they let us go? - It'll be left here. - Okay. Oh fuck. Careful! Can you go slower? - Good, now right. - I'm getting out. Left now. Do you hear me? I'm getting out! Now right. I'm in shock. And now gun it. Can you slow down? - I'm not driving with you. - Where? Listen Ludwik. Markiz said that I need to get you to Warsaw. I gave him my word. - And Sonny's word is holy. - Get yourself together. We'll wait till dusk and then go. Let's go. Eh, enough smoking. Great. We're going to have to push. Everybody out! Now! You alive? Why do you need the wheel? We should've saved the luggage. - So, why didn't you? - I thought, you... The cash is in the wheel. WARSAW Halt! Get over here. What are you doing here? We're from San... San... Sandomierz. Officer, in the last 20 minutes we've managed to catch a flat tyre twice. Now we've borrowed a tyre from a friend... we don't have a spare, because we caught a flat in it, and our friend has a car that's not functional and he couldn't help us. And why are you dirty? Because we were shovelling coal into the basement. And it was for that, that our friend gave us the wheel. Hand over your IDs. Is there something wrong? Don't turn your head while I'm talking to you. And wait here. Top, bottom, top, bottom... I'm beating him like a drum, and that beast just stands there, huge 2 metres, He breathes down my throat and starts choking me. Fingers in the eyes. He jumps back. Then I take him from the right... He falls to my feet like a log. And my left is stronger... He deserved it. He cheated at cards. When we played blackjack. He'd always put the ace under the deck and when I'd draw he'd make the trick and either he had the eye or I exceeded. I had to smite the bastard. Papa Stamm predicted a great career for me, if not for the drinking. But to be quite honest I get dangerous only after I drink. I then pick one bigger than me and I like to surprise them with a punch and then smack them in the face. Just so, you know, there's no doubt. - And what? - Nothing. Where are the guys with the wheel? The guys with the wheel? They haven't arrived yet. During the uprising our divisions would walk this way from one neighbourhood to another. Remember from history classes? I think I missed that lesson. It's always been that way. Someone has always wanted to take Poland from us. First the Germans, then the Russians, and now... And now ZOMO. Did something happen? Is something wrong with your head? You were acting strange around that patrol. No... Come on! POLISH ARMY MUSEUM Where have you brought us? To prison? Good guess. It's the Citadel, the Tsar's prison. They'd lock up the insurgents here. For what? For wanting to be free. Thank you for evervthing. Perhaps we'll meet again some time. I'm sorry you lost your car. Ahh... Take care... Artist! - Good evening Mr. Stasiu. - Good evening. Why so empty? Just the usual customers. I got the spare on offer. Hiya. Northern Poland. - Hi Mietek. - Hi. - Hi Adas, Student. - Hi. My mate Janek. - Janek. - Mietek. Janek. - Give us that table. - Hi. - May I? - Sure. Mrs. Jadziu our friends have arrived... I'm very sorry, but we're closing. Good night. Bambaryla! First of all it's not Bambaryla, but Mr. Zdzislaw. Secondly, we're closing. Curfew. Well then close. I don't want any trouble. Our friends from the coast have come. Close, sit with us. We'll all chip in, there'll be no harm. Have a drink... have a drink! I can't. I'm really sorry, but I really can't. It's out of the question. Under no circumstance. There's no such possibility. A few minutes later... Bambaryla... - Here's to Bambaryla. - Cheers. To Mr. Zdzisio. Mrs. Jadziu! Mrs. Jadziu in this case we've made up our minds. You're a loon. Precisely, a loon. Hey Student do you remember last Christmas Eve? We were in Budapest. All day we'd work near this big shop on the corner of Rakoczi and Lenin. Fuck, I'd never seen so many people eager to exchange all at once. Foreigners were doing their Christmas shopping. Snow was falling, but the frost was holding, and Student and I would cheat them like crazy. Then we'd change, different coat, hood on and back next to the shop. We made a pile of money. After work we bought a christmas tree and we sped home to make dinner. But we forgot the ornaments. So we decorated the tree in currency. And just like that, on string hung dollars, marks, francs, lira... and the top of the tree... The top I made blue. With Swedish krona. And the tree sparkles. It's our dreams fulfilled. Because it's beautiful like a dream. One has to dream sometimes. Everyone wishes for... a star. Mrs. Jadzia... Listen, listen I was drinking at the hotel on Saturday and I met this French guy. He stopped me himself, to exchange one thousand francs. I was extremely pissed. So I'm beating him up behind the hotel and out come three ZOMO. Can you imagine what a beautiful scare they gave me? The frog eater got by lightly, and I'm trying to pretend that I'm also French, whilst trying to back up. There I realise I don't have the Francs. I screwed over the guy and I didn't take his money. There's your lesson... No drinking and working. Fuck, you really lay that one out Student. - Cheers! - Cheers. And... Now there's a war, who trades, lives. When I sell blood sausages, pork fat, meat carcasses I'll have a drink of moonshine too... Supervised call. Welcome back after a short break, let's get back to the party. Don't rush me, I'm losing my breath, Don't rush me, I'm losing my rhythm... If I don't fuck someone up in the morning then I walk around in a daze all day. My pressure drops. I better not get fucking sick. Yes darling... Yes I'm beating... I mean kissing. Bye. Above the door of the deceased there hung a wooden cross, and on it a figure of a man around thirty... Shall I read on? First three. - First three. Are there none? - The last two now. I have a feeling they're going to shoot us. Come on now, us they can only send to Siberia. Maybe you... I didn't belong to anything. They can only kiss my ass. What have they locked you up for? I have a feeling it's for the same thing you're in here for sir, except I found myself here by mistake. What industry? Economic, I demonstrated for reforms, but only those that didn't exceed the quota. Cichosz, Adrian! - Here. - Hurry up! Good bye. That's not nice officer. And don't be such a wise guy, or you'll also get it in the mug. Outright in the mug? If you think you're so tough why don't we make a bet? What kind of bet? Honorary. You know such a word? You put forward your player, we put forward ours, the winner takes... 10.000? Deal? - You have that much? - That's not your concern. We'll take it from the deposit. I can hold the bets. You, you and you... out. Take it. Gong! Come on... I can't see anything. - Injury? - He fucked him up, that's it. - He put a finger in my eye. - Technical knockout! Never mind. Poland is the most important. Leave it! We'll stay where we are, and they'll stay where the ZOMO is. Mietek wait! - Let's double the bid. - Ok. We can double the bid but we're putting forward the other player. Deal! Go fetch Grzes. He's not in your weight range. Yeah he's big but easier to hit. I'll kill him with speed. It isn't easy to win a battle, when you encounter a gang. Speak, where you are publishing this paper of yours! Y- y-ou think, that I'm sca-scared of you... What does the secret police need so much currency for? We need it for our own purposes. There are operations in the west, the intelligence takes some... Anyway, you don't need to know evervthing. You'll open a base on the Coast and buy currency. Wait, wait... You'll earn yourself some points. I always pay more than it's officially worth. I'm not interested in such earnings. Such as? Am I offering you cooperation? You don't have to be an informer. All you need to do is buy me dollars. Think carefully. In case of trouble I help. But I can also do harm. And I'm not asking what you were doing yesterday with a Solidarity activist from Cracow. Wanted notices have already been issued for him. SOPO It started about nine, ten years ago. I don't know why. It simply gets me and I'm unable to say anything. Attention! All passenger trains departing from Gdynia have been cancelled until further notice. We wish you a pleasant journey. Neither asthma nor epilepsy, just this, this blockage. And always in stressful situations. We're not going to organise it on our own. We have to talk to my Professor. Luckily the cloakroom attendant didn't figure out what was in the wheel. Who keeps cash in a wheel? Just us. Citizen! Give us a light please. That's for three months. - And what army is that? - ZOMO. It's good this martial law. Maybe there'll be some order now. What this Solidarity was up to... Couldn't be bothered to work so they went on strike. How can it be good? Evervthing for papers, and I have none. Go to a peasant woman, veal costs three times that in the shop. But in the shop, of course, there isn't any. Nothing there... just vinegar. You spend hours in a queue to get bread and milk. Apparently evervthing will become more expensive. I'll show you a new trick! Cool? Yeah play, play. That doesn't concern you, after all you dine in the Grand Hotel. Do you even know how much sugar or butter costs? I can't go to work, because they won't accept Dominik to any nursery. I don't know what this year's Christmas is going to look like. I feel increasingly worse. My head hurts all day... You need to give me more child support. Couldn't you just say that to begin with? Dad will drop by on Sunday. - Bye! - Bye. The days of silent movies were beautiful. Women opened their mouths and said nothing. When a man burns himself on a hot woman, he later blows cold ones. It's a large earning. I thought you could organise it. Organise what? With the pigs? Me? People are dying here and you want to do business with the secret police. We wanted to cut you a share. Thanks, but I don't run around for points. Let me know when you have some gig. Ok then. There was no conversation. And remember, Sonny, a militiaman is always on duty. I'm bolting abroad. When? Once it calms down a little. But if he wants to go abroad, new possibilities open up. I don't know, but it's worth contemplating. - Contemplating what? - How to fool the secret police. Are you being serious? That would be something. It's no biggie fooling the Germans or those suckers from under the Pewex but a stunt with the secret police... Don't count on me. Without you there is no stunt. You smoke your face and leave. May I? Wicked... Someone added to the pot. Fidis manibus. What's that? For faithful and clean hands. It's been two months. What do we do? Well, we lead up to the first exchange and wait for a signal from the pigs. We'll see how and where it will be done. And then? And then... we'll think of something. And if the youngster doesn't agree? After all, we'll help him escape abroad. Get up! You're going to work! Janek! Will you be having scrambled eggs? Exactly... Janek, Janek! Direction to Witomino! Witomino I said! Go straight. Straight I said. I was so scared! I was so very scared. Is it possible to earn something gentlemen? In these difficult times... In your profession of course! Do we know each other? Ludwik! Are you wanted? Me? No... I saw the wanted notice. Ok, I'm in hiding, so hush. - Here, on the coast? - It's darkest under the streetlamp. Who are you in this whole Solidarity thing? The treasurer. This is our operating room. Only Warsaw knows about it. An exchange is an exchange, but... A twelve year old. And we could... deal a few hands. You want to get me drunk and outplay me? For me fun is more important than money. So... let's have some fun. How much of that cash do you have? - Seven grand. - Why so little? I don't hang out with Sonny anymore, it's more difficult on your own. You'll earn more on your own. And they say that there is nothing in the shops. They're bullshitting. Nothing like a bomb... I wouldn't do that if I were you. What is it? Better safe than sorry. Even if we had those few thousand dollars it's too big of a risk to engage it all in the stunt. It's the secret police after all. God knows what they're up to. We'll cheat them without money. What are you talking about? We don't have a chance. They won't miss a thing. They are cunning, alert and shrewd. Are you scared? We can lose our health, money or life. So? Should we let it go? We don't need this scam for anything. Shame. You know where all that green is going? There's supposedly an exchange. Not evervthing the secret police does can be done officially. It's called a special ops fund. They pay off their informants that way. Out of it they finance kidnappings, blackmail, political assassinations and what's left, they take for themselves and transfer it to secret accounts. In Switzerland? Amongst other places. I'm staying out of it. What do you mean you're quitting? I just can't handle it. I can't... What are you on about? I'm going to work. Listen you little shit, I saved you from the pen... I said: No! - Now you have to... - I don't have to do anything. You don't say no to us. Wiesiu... Don't work yourself up. CUSTOMERS IN COATS WILL NOT BE SERVED. I've thought it through. Let's do it. Ok... It's easy. The money's in the bag, the bag is in the bedroom. - It's enough to just carry it out. - Piece of cake. A break in. Marian sits there all the time. Watches the green. - He has a weapon. - What about the window? Out of the question, they wired it. We have to groom those guys for a while. Get them accustomed to certain behaviours, blunt their vigilance, but above all, sell increasing amounts of currency. We need a couple of months, to plan this stunt carefully. Couple of months? A few months later... We should weaken them somehow. I've got it. We'll get them stoned. Good. I like it. - And we'll give them mushrooms. - What? Hallucinogenic, just to be sure. Gentlemen, what if I don't manage to leave on time. After all, if they realise then... We need to ground them somehow. At least for a while, so you have time to break out of the country. Gentlemen... How do you get in, steal a bag from two armed secret police officers and exit so that they don't notice? I'm thinking... It's raw. Mine is good. A roasted one wouldn't fly. I was asking about something. Cracow wasn't built in a day. Cracow... Attention travellers. The clocks in our train station show wrong time... Attention travellers. The clocks in our train station show wrong time... Do it as best you can. But you know... Fine. I'll shut myself up. You can shut yourself in a closet. I paint pictures. So you'll paint here. Who managed to hold up a calf, will later lift up an ox. So how much of it do you need? Not much, thirty kilos. Why are you so nervous? Did something happen? Hangover. As always. What time have you got? Around twelve. Mrs. Madzia. Tea, s'il vous plait. Thanks. I have a message... and I would like to earn something for it. What is it? I will know the place and time of a meeting of the most important Solidarity activists. The most important ones have already been locked up. The ones, that are in hiding. When is it taking place? You have to give me a few zloty. I'll pay, but it has to be certain. It is. The one who wrote this will also be there. Wacek, and what do you need thirty kilos of meat for? I need it... Aha. He wouldn't talk so you know what we did? I pumped him full of water and Jzek kept jumping on his stomach. You're creative. And he talked. And this week they brought us a guy. He wouldn't cooperate. What have I not come up with... I threatened I'll chop his finger off... With a chisel. You threatened? You chopped it off. - No. - No...? - Well no. - No...? No! How much have you got? How much of what? Oh that. 60.000. Nice. Will we have enough? No thanks, I quit. And I don't watch TV. What time should we meet? Same as usual. Right. Balls. He quit smoking! We won't get him stoned. And mushrooms are not enough. We have to bake cookies. Hash cookies. You can do that? Even better. They last longer. And what... Don't chicken out! We've got it all under control. Above all, we must not let Krlik count the dollars, which we clearly don't have. If it gets critical Wacek will show up and create a turmoil. Wacek and turmoil... In case of trouble we'll come to your aid. You'll send me parcels to the pen? Thanks... There's a great stir amongst the birds. These fly away, these stay... A mute swan. Cygnus olor. Herbivorous bird. Bread is not the best nourishment for it. It has a negative effect on its digestive system. Destroys the stomach and the liver. And what state is your liver in, Wacek? Ehhh... I deducted for the papers, the ones you took. For the meat. Carry on. Grand Hotel. Apartment 207. They start gathering at 6 pm. There'll be twelve of them. The last supper. And did you know that Hitler also stayed in this hotel? You're bullshitting me... September 1939. He wanted to have a view of the capitulation of Hel. But he didn't see it as our guys were defending themselves since the second of October. Wacek... Where do you know all that from? My grandfather was in the Wehrmacht. No caviar? But there are mushrooms. French? French are the best. Delicious. Should we play harder? Done. Ice would be good. The Scots drink without ice. Has a better kick when it's warm. They start gathering at 6pm, but we move on my mark. Maybe let Marian count the papers. Maybe he should. I'm going to take a piss. You think little shit you're such a smartass? Money changer... little thief... Shit! We're out of paper. We're out of paper. Cookies perhaps? Italian. If so... I'll try. Italian cookies are the best. Free Lech, lock up Wojciech, free Lech, lock up Wojciech... Comrade Colonel, they want to bang Walesa out. We'll bang their kidneys. We're moving in... Black inside, red outside. Black inside, red outside, yes? Red inside, black outside. One more time? There. Red inside, black outside. Please. Black inside, red outside. Ready? Of course. Berlin, 4th April 1945, time 14: 12 That day Standartenfhrer Szpiglic was unexpectedly called in by the Obergrupennfurera Kaltenbruner to the headquarters of the RSHA. The state security police. He didn't know whether Kaltenbruner knew the same thing, that Mller the head of the Gestapo had found out from a radiotelegraphist earlier... Would you like to exchange some money? - No, thanks. - We already have some. In that case I apologise. So Standartenfhrer Szpiglic could only count on himself. Walking into the lion's den, he knew there was only one thing he could do. He'd have to play a very risky game. Militia! Militia, halt, don't move! Come with us, they're not beating today! Shut your mouth! IDs, now! Major Krlikowski, security service. Ensign Lachoni, black brigade. Security? From Warsaw? Bravo! You won't wiggle your way out this time. Evervthing has been recorded. Where's the rest Comrade Colonel? And what have you got in... on your mind? The third one, the one that was with them and that German who wanted to change some money. Security agent caught whilst leaving counts as double. Fuck. Halt! Step right up! Yes? Drop the bag, hands up high! What have you got there? We're from the Department of Sanitation. Here we have e coli and dysentery bacilli and other germs from across the entire bay. We'll see. No, no, I don't know... Rash, blisters, burns, abscess. I know that this is very dangerous but the officer is on duty and he must insist. Go ahead, open it up sir. To all crews. End of action. Retreat. Immediately. Disperse. Did you see? He freaked out. So what's in the bag? - Money. - Operational. We're going to the police station. Move it. Quickly. Wait... Where's the money bag? Would you gentlemen like a lift? You fell from the sky, man. Thanks... Maybe we could meet tomorrow, we'll have a drink, talk... Alright. And where can one do that discreetly... Marago? At 8pm. Bye. Don't pull. What is it? The secret police is, you understand, a sore on the healthy organism of our department. Today I squeezed it. That's right Comrade Colonel. Gentlemen... It's a bit stuffy.

No. I should have, because it's Markiz who invented that scam with the boot. - What are you laughing at? - You know what. But I don't get it! Sometimes it's worth doing something for others. Because it can come back to you someday. After all it's only money. Go buy yourself something. Cast
