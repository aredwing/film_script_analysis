Before Hong Kong's Handover to China in 1997 - Four fives. - Open! - Yeah! Drink! - I gotta win. Let's guess again. One bottle. Seven sixes? All of a kind again? You know how to play or not? Waiter, show her the instruction book. Let me introduce my brother. Tiger. Sam. - Nice to meet you, Sam! - Nice to meet you! You sweat a lot. That's my real brother, Archer. I got lots of inventory. I have men everywhere but you want it all. You're going to Vietnam. The three of us can take care of this. Who knows better than us? We're from Vietnam. Your splitting ratio is fine by me. Lost again. No, No. One more time. Four aces. One bottle. Four aces? - You sure you got them? - I'm bloody sure I do. Police inspection. Lights on. Stand over there! You! Step forward! I drew the bottle. So what? Excuse me... I'm sorry... On Jan 2, 1996, you intentionally injured a suspect in Mongkok, fracturing his hipbone and 3 ribs. Do you admit it? On Feb 17, 1996, during an anti-Triad operation on Temple Street, you injured another suspect intentionally, causing a serious head concussion and permanent anosmia. Do you admit it? - In 1996... - Enough! I admit to it all. During the first part of this year alone, you had an average of 14 operations a month and you insured an average of This year you allready broke last year, record in less then 6 months. What's wrong with cops busting thieves? It's my turn to complain. Are you guys busting thieves or cops? I know you're an excellent officer, Inspector Ma. You also have the highest rate of solving crime. But your attitude is the problem, That needs to change. I don't see any problem with that! OK, you can go. I've been here for over an hour. Could have cracked already a case outside. You better evaluate your law enforcement standards. Don't waste everybody's time. Good! Give me 50 grand. Such a high stake! You'll lose. Tiger. That's not the way to play golf. It's not kung fu. Stand firm. I'll teach you, ok? It's very simple. Grab the club. Keep your feet and shoulders in a straight line. Keep your eyes on the ball. Follow through with your Swing. That's just for an example. O.K. Next time! Next time! Something seems wrong, Archer. Don't say anything. My friends here are clean. Go now! I asked you to transport some goods to Vietnam. But it's always either to windy or to rainy. It's been 2 months already! Planning a trip to the moon? Are you trying to fuck with me? No man, but bad weather is quite natural. I didn't even blame you for the bad luck. I have 80M there. Get it back and we call it quits. Should've told me earlier. I'll send it by express for you. It only takes a couple of days by plane. Why would you use a boat? It would take weeks. You better wait quietly at home! What did you say? Be cool or I'll knock the hell of you. Are you threatening me? Who the fuck you think you are? I know you're the boss but you can't tell me what to do You need your henchman. Ask Tony to come out. Shit! That's how we run things here. Is it really necessary to do this in public? Just putting on sun block! You trying to get even or what? Wait for me first. You always end up arguing. Later! Ask him to cut the crap. He could've busted me. Why does he always have to fight? Even though I know you're good at it. You called me for help and I gave you a hand. Now things got out of hand and you're blaming me. Stop yelling! You jerkoff, lousy piece of meat! And you hurt my wrist so badly. The doctor said there might be complications. Last time you threw a bottle of wine at me. I would've blown your cover if I hadn't reacted. And you fought back. Remember? I would've lost face if I hadn't fought back. Lost face? You're a fucking cop! Lost face? You want a loudspeaker, you dumbo? You're partners. You shouldn't have hit him so hard. Knowing his temper, you shouldn't have provoked him. Why make such a mess? When I'm duped, you said we're partners. But he can play the model every day. You two want me to be a snitch till when? Let Bygones be bygones. Who's leading whom anyway? - Not this again! - Not what? Cops have regulations. Stop arguing. You might not be partners anymore. Really? The verdict is out. You still lead. Report to the Police Band next week. No way! They've gone too far! As you just said, cops have regulations. I'm appealing! Keep it up! Ditto! We can't think too much. Just go ahead! If we're destined to die, so be it! What's wrong with you? You got it wrong 4 times! How so? The E-flat after the sextuplet on the 12th bar. We heard nothing. Just you yelling. Be serious! We are cops. If you wanna play, form your own band. You can't expect everyone to be like you. - You dare to talk back... - You are definitely wrong! When a cop errs, he either hurts others or he hurts himself. Do yourjob well. Mom, I'm busy. I won't bother you. I'm going back to my hometown. I'll go with you when I have time. I did wait. I waited till my friend there died. If I'm happy there, I probably won't come back. Mom, don't! I'll be bored here all by myself. You worry about me, yet you have no time for me. Be careful. Don't risk your life catching thieves. What's most important to a man? Preserving life. Without life, how can you be a man? Be careful. I gotta go. We're all trying to make a living here. You swiped Sam's goods. He came here to talk but you wanted him dead. Now you ask us to stay out of the way? Sam has to go. You don't wanna get hurt by accident, do you? If you back off, nothing will happen. Without you three, nothing will happen. You better not mess up my place. We took you in when you were refugees. We were stuck in the refugee camp like prisoners. Why did we riot? Because we wanted our own home. If anyone wants us to leave today, they have to fight us. - Brother! - How's the talk? Didn't work? No, we're still talking. Don't move yet, or there's no point talking anymore. Don't play games, you three. - Forget it. Let's move. - Wait. I'll let you talk to him. Your wife took your son to school so early. It would be a pity if he's dead. You're buffing me. Of course. Thought I'd buy you breakfast? I don't wanna hurt each other's feelings either. If you can talk, we can cooperate in the future. The woman in red with the child, both wearing glasses. He looks kind of dumb. When I ask you to dash toward them, you go ahead. OK! Hurry up. Made up your mind yet? Your son is almost near the door. I didn't hear an answer. I'll stay out of Sam's business. Louder, or he can't hear. I'll stay out of Sam's business. You stand down, I stand down. Archer... Hero. Let's get together and have fun some time. We're buddies. Glad that you said that. Let's have breakfast. Don't waste it. - Dash forward. - OK. Take a turn. Are you a dog? So obedient. He asked you to dash and you did. It's dangerous. So cruel. I rented a place tonight to celebrate your birthday. I'm meeting a friend. - What? You have friends? - Sure! - Have fun! - Thanks, Archer. Lynn. Of course it's me. You free? Come over. Why are you cursing me? Auntie May, can I talk to your daughter? What? She's dead? I'm so sorry! Vivien, it's Wilson. What? Nothing, it's my birthday today. Don't say it's none of your business. Actually I won the lottery today... - Judy, please. - Happy Birthday! Thank you... Are you off work already? Not yet. I'll drop by your place later. OK, bye! Bye. Long time no see. Not that long. Only half a year! Been to Vietnam lately? Be careful if you're going there. Don't be caught by the cops. They put people away for eating Pho? You said you wouldn't sell liquor but you are now. You think I like selling liquor? What else can I do? A whore? Don't say that. There're many ways to fame. You know this Blue Girl. She also sold liquor. Now she has her own brand. How about Carlsberg? Carl used to sell burgers before he sold beer. That's why his brand is called Carlsberg. How about mine? So don't say we have no future. Johnny Walker used to walk here, there, everywhere. I'll take a shower. I'll leave on my own later. - Something's up, Tiger? - You bet! Where we going later? - Picnic in the suburbs! - OK! Take my daughter first! - Cops! Get into the car! - Shit! You can be discharged any time. If you wanna fight, I won't cut you slack. If you wanna die, don't get me involved. I wanna testify. Come in! Inspector Wong, we brought a perp in. It hurts, Inspector Wong. Get me something to drink. It's so hot. Sam has squealed on Tony. That's great. Take him in! We need to plan our deployment. Those guys are fierce. You'll die if they find out. I know that. I'm more scared than you. Don't tell me you're leading the operation! Relax. Those Viets are not my turf. Call back the most ferocious officer. The Force needs him urgently. It's you who need him the most. Inspector Wong! Shut the door! What's with you? Why you kept the door open for so long? It's OK. Let me know if anything goes wrong. It's fine, or I wouldn't have called you back. Get this over with quickly and we'll go for a dip. All right? - Sure. - Yes, officer. Put on your helmet. - Let me finish my cig first. - Drop your cig... or you won't find a gal. Put on your helmet first! Bastard! Inspector Wong, look at him! Beat him up! It's almost 1997. Stop horsing around. It's their mom's birthday tonight. They'll show up. Help me clear the scene first. We need you to assist in the Viets' case. OK! Wilson! Wilson... Have a bite. It's very yummy. - Try it! - Auntie. Many happy returns! May you be younger and prettier! Thank you! No appetite? Don't talk to her. She won't eat. - Gotta go! - OK. Enjoy your meal, Auntie. Call again if you don't get a reply. What time is it? Still not a soul. - Have a bite! - Shit! Let's go! Have a bite! Tiger! Come over! You're too loud! You scared Mom. Kneel down! Say sorry to Mom. Mom! Please eat something. Everybody is here. So nobody's going to Archer's Mom's birthday? Have a bite. Come on. Have a bite. It's very yummy. I'll order something else for you. Sea cucumber? Abalone? You don't like this? How about bird's nest? Shark fin! Brother, we have a situation! What situation can be worse than Mom not eating? Please eat. Tiger, feed Mom. Let's start working! Stay here tonight. Someone will take care of you. Good luck with the bust, Inspector Ma. Come on. Please eat. You don't like the food in this restaurant. I can take you to another one. OK? Tiger! - Wilson! Come here. - Coming. - Hurry up! - OK! Captain! You have a car? What make? Where's it parked? So? Take the cash. I drive Mom first. See you at the pier. Got it! Where we going? To the warehouse. What's wrong? I saw nobody. How do I know when he left? Saw anyone suspicious? - Inspector Ma! - How's his situation? Still breathing. The ambulance is on its way. - Cindy... - Yes! Check his license plate number. Yang, you stay behind and wrap things up. Yes, sir. Hello. Where are you? I'm at your door. I'm busy. I'll call you back. Should I wait for you at your place tonight? Not tonight. I'll cut you a key... next time. Bye. - Stop talking on the phone! - Sorry. The target is a dark green Mazda MPV. License plate JL2933. The other is a crimson Acura. DE3654. Give me a hand. Did you lock the door, Tiger? You're right! I'll go lock it. You get in first. They are packing to flee. Talk later. Let's go, Tony - Is it locked? - Yes! Sit at the back! OK! That one looks like it. Wilson, hand me your phone. Tony! Sit tight, Mom Slow down! Pull over! I say pull over! Mom, sit tight! It's headed towards Chai Wan. - Hang in there. - I wanna puke. Puke there. It's OK. Just puke. It's made a turn towards an industrial building. Get off! We're headed toward the pier. Go see what happened. Are you all right, buddy? - How's Wilson? - Inspector Wong! Dunno yet. Doctors are operating on him. That means he will be OK. Stay calm. What's with you? Are you crazy? If anything happens to Wilson, you have to pay. - What's with you? - None of your business. You must be Judy. I can arrest you for hitting a cop. - So what if you're a cop? - Wilson is my partner. He's also a cop. What you in for? Triad? No, I'm no Triad. Then follow me... Call me Archer. Archer. Did you see your three sons beat people up? I have three sons? He has disappeared. Sir, can you call the police for me? I need to call the police. My son has disappeared. No one will take care of her, now or ever. Watch over her. She might go astray. It's my birthday. I'm 80 today. Come earlier. I'm 80. I'm 80. Archer Sin, there's enough evidence that from 1992 to Feb 1997, you've been involved in smuggling, infliction of injury and Triad activities. You're hereby thus charged. Do you confess? No, sir. The court is adjourned till May. Meanwhile, turn over your travel documents. No travel outside Hong Kong. No bail. All your assets will be frozen till the case is closed. You're blaming all this on me. Sure you can do it? Go! Hands off! - Or I'll sue you for sexual harassment. - Go! Three Months Later I almost can't catch up with you! I'll slow down a bit for you, ok? Slowly. You'll get used to it slowly. Of course slowly. One of my feet is crippled. Everything has been well arranged. You're transferred to Admin. Effective next week. Admin? The government should compensate me. But they won't. I even need to pay for court fees. Isn't it ridiculous? You call this well arranged? I've done so much for the Force and for the citizens. What do I get in return? If I go out now... I dunno which roads are good for the crippled. All your buddies are waiting for you. Hang tough. I'm hanging tough. If they're waiting for me, they'll pick me up here. But you're the only one. I've left something. Don't wait for me. How are you? Tiger and I will be back before your trial. I won't let Wilson and Sam testify. Tiger. Mom. Three sons... I'll take you home. Mom, you remember here? We used to live here. After I pick up Archer, we'll leave Hong Kong. Give it to me. - What so funny? - Nothing. I rather like your foot injury. You won't be horsing around all day. You can stay with me at home from now on. You took great care of me. You must love me deeply. Don't you know that inside a woman's DNA, there's a gene for taking care of others? For this gene, I'd rather stay like that forever. - Thank you. - You're welcome. They're here. Let me change my pants first. Be right there. - Be careful. Hello! Delivery! Hurry up! Hurry up! Come have a look. Great stuff! - What a heavy gift! - Definitely heavier than Inspector Wong. Why you live on the top floor? It's so heavy. We're only giving a hand. Ma is the greatest. He bought it and delivered it. Where should we put it? Put it here. Give me a hand! - Stay out of the way! - Stay out of the way! Hurry up! Slowly. Don't scratch it. This chair costs 30 grand. Paid by one person only. Sincere enough? That goes without saying. - Got an extension socket? - Yes. Let me do it. You guys are so clumsy. Hurry up. Where's the extension socket? I know you're poor in English. It's also in Chinese. Automatic. Just like driving a car. Press this button. You say your foot hurts all the time. This machine circulates the blood in your foot. My blood is fine. I just can't walk with this foot. Walking shouldn't be that difficult. Given your intelligence and wisdom. Train your left foot to be as dexterous as your right one. - You know what you're talking about? - Just kidding. But I guess the joke is dead. I'll stop laughing. Let me open the door. Delivery! - Smells good! - It's food. - What is it? - Good stuff. This family is most important to you. I envy you. What's more important than family? If you can be like me, you're blessed. Food is ready. Wait... Let's have a group pic first. Sure, we can take the pic while we eat. No, let's have the pic before we eat. I cooked this chicken for you. - Have a pic with the chicken. - With the chicken? Go ahead. As a memento mori. Good. Done! Let's plunge in. - But the chicken is very cold. - Let's eat right away. Wait a minute. Heat it up. We have our standards. - Doesn't matter. We can still eat it. - Inspector Wong! Just put it in the oven. Very simple. Chicken... 200 degrees... You shouldn't eat... I'll give Inspector Wong a hand. Is Judy all right? She's still in the observation ward. Are you guys OK? I'm officially taking over Inspector Wong's duties. To play safe, the whole team will take a vacation. They're trying to kill a cop and a witness. It has to be the Viets. Why a vacation? I'm concerned about your safety. Everyone is risking his life. You want us to lay off? You're in Admin now. Go first. When I was a snitch, I was scared every day. Now that I'm crippled, I should be better off. Even my house was bombed. You want me to go? Madam, the uniform is not for showing off. I'll bust them if we have enough evidence. Do we? Look what the Madam is doing! Where is Tony? I dunno. Enough. You're killing him. Give me the gun... Give me the gun! Give me the gun! - Give the gun! - He dunno. You're going to court tomorrow. Madam, what should we do now? It's most important to find out where Tony is. It's most important to protect Wilson in the hospital. He's the only witness left. Let's go, Cindy. Let's go, Yang. Still writing! I prefer the old you. Don't be a cop. You're crazy... Mom has a house back home. Let's live with her. You hate it here? I've been here for long, but it never feels like home. Mom wants the three... of us to go back. Already two months. You don't like it? Frisk everyone in and out of the hospital. Every entrance and exit, back door, stairwell, toilet... Everywhere. Is that clear? Yes, sir. The trial is about to start. Wilson has to be OK. He's hungry. Should we buy him some food? I'll buy you something to eat! Don't run around. Wait, Inspector Ma. Wilson, Inspector Ma asked you not to run around. Thanks! Police! Stay away! There're gunshots at the elevator hallway. The suspect is in the elevator. Get help! Fast! I have her... OK... What do you want? Just say it! I'll do it. Are you scared? Yes... Yes... What do you want? Just say it! I'll do it. Watch out! Wanna die? Go! Mommy! Toss me your weapon. Put the girl down! I said toss me your weapon! Give me back my daughter! I'll blow her head off! - Put the girl down! - You want her dead? How are you, darling? Answer me! Inspector Ma? What's the situation? Inspector Ma! Gotta go to court! Hello... Wilson, where are you? Off to the court! Something happened to Judy? Yes! Don't believe him. He won't let her go. I got no choice! Why not? You're choosing to help the bastards. I don't want anything to happen to her. I don't want anything to happen to either of you. You wanna die with her?! I need a statement from you. You killed the suspect. Arrest me then. Witness, you can testify now. I don't remember anything. Because the witness failed to testify for loss of memory, the court rules that all charges against Archer Sin shall be dismissed for lack of evidence. Tony, I'm out. Speak! Where? Nan Shang Wei. Hurry up. I'll wait for you. Stop fighting. Stop it! Stop fighting... Wilson... Wilson... I never thought I would leave... I just want her to be OK... Wilson... Shoot! Shoot, Tony! Go ahead! Scared? Drop your piece! - Drop your piece! - Drop your motherfucker! - Asshole! - Shoot! What you waiting for? Don't curse my mom! Bro! Shoot the asshole! Shit! Let me drive. Open the door, what do you want? Open the door, what's the matter? Come with me. Don't go back. Don't go. You promised me you wouldn't go. Ma, come out and fight me. Shit! Kenji You're over, Tony. Have I ever busted the wrong guy? I'll leave the answer to the judge. My duty as a cop... is to catch thieves.
