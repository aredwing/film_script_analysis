The old boy thought the one about cabinet ministers' wives was going a bit far, so I sold it to the Daily Mail instead. Debunking celebrities seems to be your passion, Miss Graham. It sells newspapers, doesn't it? This one has a kind of broad appeal to it. "Given a choice in these hard times, would a wife take a car or a baby?" A car, of course. "Stage-door Johnnies by a London chorus girl. " You were a chorus girl too, Miss Graham? I couldn't have written that article if I hadn't been, could I? I thought you said you... I mean, you were born... Oh, well, even a duchess can join the chorus if she has the legs, Mr. Wheeler. I just went in to get background for my story, that's all. That's where I met Lord Donegall. Who's he? My fianc, the Marquis of Donegall. He came to the show one night and without even knowing who I was he sent a note round afterwards. As a matter of fact, I felt rather proud of myself. I let him take me out to supper and, of course, when he found out who I was, he thought the whole thing was a huge joke. And are you still going to marry Lord Donegall? Certainly. Eventually. Uh... His mother is the one I can't stomach. The old dowager marchioness. So Don thought perhaps a few months in the States... sort of cool off a bit, you know, and... When I meet her again, perhaps I'll find I don't mind her so much. So, you see, I do hope you can find something worthwhile for me, Mr. Wheeler. - Get me Fred Johnson at the Mirror. - Yes, sir. You certainly write a good story, Miss Graham. Johnson is the managing editor of the Mirror. They take a lot of our features. Fred? Is it hot enough for you? Listen. I have a girl here... a lady. - That's what I said. - Who? Sheilah Graham? Yes, John, yeah. No. I've never heard of her. You will hear of her, Fred. And another thing - this girl knows everybody. Friend of Lord Beaverbrook's. Everybody under the sun. The Prince of Wales? Certainly she does. Read all about it. Mrs. Wallis Simpson granted divorce. Paper? Rebel planes bomb Madrid. Read all about it. New feature starts today. Read Sheilah Graham's column - "Is Marriage Obsolete?" Sheilah, my love, my wife called me and said that if ever mention your name again - she's calling a lawyer. - You mean your wife read the story? Sheilah, everyone's wife has read the story. I'm having trouble with mine... Oh-oh. Here comes John. Be brave, Sheilah, and if you need help... Don't call us. Woody, Frank. How are you? John. Well, uh... we have to catch a train. - Merry Christmas, John. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, John. I trust it will be a merry one. This is quite a story, Sheilah. Unfortunately in an opposition paper. Well, I did offer it to the Mirror first. "Who cheats the most in marriage?" You have the English as odds-on favourites. I do know them best, you know. "Germans are too stodgy. Frenchmen make no secret of it. " "If the main occupation of American women were not alimony, Americans would cheat the most. " That's the real reason Johnson fired me. He's paying three alimonies. Well, I must say you do sell newspapers. I warned you I would. Sheilah, I have a little Christmas present for you. A year's contract. Well, thank you, John. But I'm not sure. I've had a letter from Donegall begging me to go back. I'll terminate the contract the day you get married. No... Meanwhile, I'll raise your salary. - By how much? - Double what you got on the Mirror. Sheilah, I want you to do a column... from Hollywood. Hollywood? You know, John, I think I might like that. It's a deal. No, no, no, Jack. That's all wrong. You can do as you please, of course. But I'm not going to bar her from our studio. I'm handling that in my own way, personally. All right, Jack. I'll talk to you later. Sheilah. - Well, how are you? - Very well, thank you, Mr. Harris. - How are you? - Fine. Won't you sit down? Yes. - I'm glad you could come over. - I'm glad I could get in. I must say, you're a very controversial figure this morning. Harry, if you want me after you've talked to New York, I'll be on stage 10. - Bye, Sheilah. - Goodbye, Harry. Thank you. It was a pleasure. - Will you come over to stage 10 with me? - Yes, I'd love to. I'd like you to watch some scenes we're shooting for The O'Learys. Oh, yes... The cow that kicked over the lamp that burned Chicago. Janet Pierce. I'm curious, Sheilah. What have you got against Janet Pierce? Personally, nothing whatsoever. Then why did you take that slap at her in your column? I merely stated the well-known truth that she can't act. Sheilah, you're in a position where a thing like that in your column can do a lot of harm. Even to a star as well-established as Janet. Mm... Should I consider that a compliment, or a spanking? I'd like you to consider it a responsibility. You're a member of the community now. You can afford to be a little constructive too, you know. All right. I suppose I can. Although I think you have an exaggerated idea of the power of my column. I understand Miss Pierce is sizzling at the box office. Fortunately for the studio... that is true. The Coopers are having a few people over after dinner. Come to our house first and we'll go together. I'd love it, but I don't know if the Coopers would. Of course they would. Ronnie Colman is coming. You know him. - Yes, slightly. - And Janet Pierce will be going. - You're very kind. I'd love to. - Good. They're rehearsing. Janet, when you look in the mirror and see Dion standin' there, pick it up a little bit quicker. Quiet, please. This'll be a take. - Camera. - Roll the tape. - Speed. - Action. - Get out of here. - Belle, listen... - Get out of here. - Listen to me, Belle... Get out! - Will you... get out?! - Listen... Hey, no! Help, Hattie! Will you get out? Cut. What's the matter, Janet? It was going beautifully. Why did you stop? Sorry, Bill. There's a visitor on the set. Sure. It's Sheilah Graham. I know who it is. When she leaves I'll be in my dressing room. Janet... Janet! Darling, the dailies this morning were wonderful. And you? You were just great. Oh, thank you. - I have Sheilah Graham here. - Here? On the set? Yes. She wants to do a story on you. Oh, Sheilah? - Hello, Miss Pierce. - Tell me, Miss Graham. How did a girl as pretty as you are ever get to be the biggest witch in Hollywood? And that word is spelled with a capital 'B ' - Janet... - Well, Miss Graham? Not the biggest, Miss Pierce. The second biggest. Stan, why do you bring these stray cats onto the set? Janet! Not the biggest, Janet. The second biggest. I'll only be a minute. - Sheilah. - John! Oh, John... Forgive me. I'm just so happy to see you. If you were any happier, I'd need water wings. Oh, I'm sorry, John. I needed that. I've been feeling sorry for myself all day. You're the only one in Hollywood feeling sorry for Sheilah Graham. - Do sit down, John. - I can't stay. I just dropped in on my way to the airport to give you a word of warning. Sheilah, darling, if you go on attacking people, the door will be slammed in your face forever. That's no good for columnists. But, John, I write about Hollywood as I see it, and if I attack it, that's my privilege. I'm a reporter. I don't mind my columnists being controversial. That sells papers. But when they're controversial controversial, that's trouble. Some of the publishers are threatened with loss of advertising. Please let up a little. Well, I know that the sure road to failure is to try to please everybody and still write a good column. You know what I mean. Ease up. Barely time to catch my plane for San Francisco. - Oh, John. Must you go now? - I'll be back in about ten days. All right. If you're a good girl and follow my advice, I may be able to get you a weekly radio broadcast, like Louella has. - Keep that to yourself. - Yes, all right. Goodbye, John. Cut. Print. I knew you were writing these shorts, but I didn't know you were in them. - They needed a no-talent actor. - Oh, come on. - Lord Donegall leave? - Yes. On Sunday. Listen, got any choice titbits for my column? No. But I'm giving a party tomorrow. I want you to come. Bob, I'd love to, but I've been showing Don the town for two weeks and I'm exhausted. Oh, come on, come on. It's somebody's birthday. Enough things might happen to fill your column for a week. - We're ready for you, Mr. Carter. - Thank you. Please, it's a fun party. Don't go away. No. All right. - Roll the tape. - Action. Today we're taking up the ordinary household problem of opening a can of sardines. The intelligent thing to do is to use a can opener. But if there's no can opener available, many other kitchen utensils will do the job. The ice pick. Simply drive the ice pick into the tin of sardines. And use a strong knife... There you are. Not only have you freed the can of sardines, but you also have your household hint for today. How to convert a kitchen table into a flower garden. Cut. Print. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to propose a toast. To Scott. One of the greatest novelists in the English language. - Hear, hear. - And I should know, because as a punishment, I was forced to read him since I was six years old. I don't mean this impostor, F. Scott Fitzgerald. I mean the real Scott... Sir Walter Scott. And in paying tribute to Sir Walter, the creator of Ivanhoe... And I don't know why we should. Instead let me propose a toast to the Westchester Power and Light Company, who shut off my lights and forced me to come to Hollywood, where I can afford to give parties like this. Oh, you lucky girl! You're going to dance with me. Stop it. You're making me blush. - Am I? - Mm-hm. You have a lovely sensitive face. As a columnist, you've got to be as tough as nails. And you're going to marry a lord, aren't you? Yes. Yes. Genuine? - Coronet, ermine robes, the whole...? - Yes, certainly. Wear them every morning for breakfast. That's what you were really brought up to do? Absolutely. How do you put all that together? Oh... Looks, brains, influence. And what is it you're going to be? A duchess? A lady? - A marchioness. - Well, there you are. You see? You're a jigsaw puzzle. Of course I am. I'm incredible. Hm... What are you looking at now? Surely you've found out everything you want to know. Mm-mm. Which is the happy one and which is the sad one? Sad what? Eye. Everyone has a sad eye and a happy eye. Oh? Well, which is my sad eye? - This one? - Mm... Thank you very much. I'll tell you something else about eyes. A grey eye is a sly eye, a brown eye is a roguish eye, but a true eye is blue. And yours are true blue. Of that there can be no doubt. And yours are brown. There's no doubt about that either. What are you going to do about it? Well, under the circumstances there's precious little I can do. Have dinner with me. I don't want to lose you. - When? - Tomorrow. Hello? Oh, hello, Scott. I'm terribly sorry about this last-minute thing. I'm still at the studio. Stan Harris wants me to have dinner with him and talk about a new assignment. Of all times it would have to be tonight. I'm afraid that takes care of the evening for us. Well, perhaps it needn't. Look, if you feel like it, why don't you come by after you've finished? I'll still be up. I'll be there. All right. - Hello, Sheilah. - Hello, Scott. Come in. Well, how did it go at the studio today? I don't really know. He's got a story that I'd very much like to do. They ought to be jolly lucky to get you. Well... Thanks for the vote of confidence. He's not quite so sure about me as a screenwriter. I like your place. It's sweet. Well, thanks... Let me give you a drink. No, thanks. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. That's you? Yes. At the ripe old age of three. - Who's this little devil? - Oh, that's my brother, Derek. Must be your father. No. No, that's my grandfather, Sir Richard. It's a picture taken in his hunting pink. He was master of the Devon Staghounds. The old boy was insane about the subject. He rode to hounds until he was 80, I believe. Well, what do you know. That was when I was presented at court - Buckingham Palace, you know. - Buckingham Palace? - Yes. - Would you...? - Shall we...? - Shall we have a look outside? - At the view, yes. Um... Now you tell me about you. Are there masses of Fitzgeralds? No, the Minnesota Fitzgeralds are in short supply lately. There's just me. I really took this place just for this view. And weren't you right. There's not much noise up here. One... one sleeps soundly. I... I mean, once one's in bed, one... I don't seem to be able to breathe properly when I'm with you. You know this is a mistake? Yes. Yes, I do. Hold it right there. OK, thank you. He's got a great sense of humour. You and Scott have been friends for a long time. I was the best man at his wedding. I guess I know Scott about as well as he allows any man to know him. Mm-hm. He doesn't volunteer much about himself. No, not much. - What's his wife like? - Zelda? She was young... and beautiful. No party was complete without the glamorous Fitzgeralds. Zelda danced on the tables. They both dove fully dressed into that fountain in front of the Hotel Plaza. Oh... - Where is she now? - Asheville, North Carolina. - Are they divorced? - No. Zelda's in a sanitarium... for the insane. Oh... They have a daughter. She was about 13 when Zelda cracked up. Scott put her in a school. He had specialists come in from all over the country to try to help Zelda. He ran out of money and went on an epic drunk. And now the irony of this whole situation... Here's Scott, one of the most distinguished novelists in America, working in Hollywood, taking on any assignment, just struggling to make enough money to pay the medical bills and keep his daughter in school. Would you care to order now? Oh... What do you want? Oh, um... I don't mind. A fruit salad or something... Greetings, friends. I got your message about lunch. I was tied up with Stan Harris. Thanks for not making it. I had her all to myself. I'll see you back at the fleabag, huh? - Have you had lunch? - Not yet. I'm due at MGM. I'm interviewing Gable. Wow. Well, I'll see you to your car. Any news? I got the assignment! Darling, that's wonderful. I knew you would. The fantastic part of it is it's a story I've loved for years. I've finally got a screenplay to work on that I think could really turn out. And you know what else is in it for Fitz-whatsit? Money. Plenty money. - Nothing but money. - Oh, Scott, it sounds so exciting. - When do you start? - Bright and early Monday. - Let's go somewhere for the weekend. - Oh, that's a lovely idea. Isn't there some desert out there, some mountains or Mexico or something or other? You've got yourself a date. Ho-ho! Oh! Look at them. Hey, muchachos! Go on. Oh, look. Come on, come on. Come on! They say an author reveals himself subconsciously in his writings. - Do you, Scott? - I suppose I do. I know so little about you really. Do you know I have never read a single thing you've written? And you've been presented at Buckingham Palace to the king and queen of England with such a gap in your education? We'll have to take care of that right away. - Hello. - Can I help you? Do you have any of the novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald? No, I'm sorry, nothing in stock. I can try to get them for you. Oh... - Do you have any calls for them? - Once in a while. Not for some time, though. Novels. Who reads good novels today? Now all it is is politics, yogi, cookbooks... I've got a beautiful set of Balzac out back that the mice are enjoying. Do you like Fitzgerald? Yes, I'm a great admirer of Mr. Fitzgerald. - A good novelist, in your opinion? - Oh, yes, in my opinion. Well, mine too. Which ones were you interested in? The Great Gatsby, This Side of Paradise, Tender is the Night. Well, if there's none about, I can order them from the publisher for you if you'll give me your name and address. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the Garden of Allah. My, oh, my. So it is. Mr. Fitzgerald, I should have recognised you. This is an honour, a real honour for me. Thank you very much. How many years since your last novel? Five, six? That's about right. You must give us more. Many, many more. Even though the public's a bit slow in buying you now, they'll wake up. They'll come back. I've seen it happen over and over. - Thank you very much. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Come in, Sheil-o. - Hello, darling. - Hello, Pancho. I'm just finishing up. It'll take me one minute. Mm-hm! My! 16 pages of screenplay in one day - I am very impressed. It's going all right. Not too bad, not too bad. You look more attractive every day. Today you look like tomorrow. - Have you got any plans for us tonight? - Yes. The same as last night. To be with you. There is one thing I want to show you. Here in the drama section, Ed Schallert's column. There's a play tonight at the Pasadena Playhouse. It's from a short story I wrote years ago... A Diamond as Big as the Ritz. Darling, how marvellous! Let's go! - Would you like to? - Of course! I'd love to! I've never read it. It might not be much. Darling, the Playhouse puts on wonderful things. It might go to Broadway. Oh, Scott, let's go. We'll do it right. You wear that beaded gown. Yes, all right. I'll wear black tie. Dinner at the Trocadero. Of course. And a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. - As big as the Ritz. - Bigger. Did I have the date wrong? It doesn't look much like an opening night. No, it does look rather dark. Look, here's someone. Let's ask. Boy, oh, boy! Would you like to have that. - Oh, young man? - Yes, sir? Is there a performance tonight of A Diamond as Big as the Ritz? Oh, yes, sir. We're putting it on... The students. You know, for the students. Upstairs in the Bandbox. Oh, I see. I guess you could go up if you like. I'm sure no one would mind. It's a lovely play. Is it? - What part do you play? - Kismine. Oh, that's nice. Who plays your sister Jasmine? Oh, you know the play? Well, yes. I happen to be the author. The author? F. Scott Fitzgerald? But I thought... I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Fitzgerald. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Fitzgerald. Come on, Billy. Really, I'm sure it would be all right... Scott Fitzgerald. For crying out loud, was I surprised. I'm glad I caught myself in time. I thought he was dead. Come on, Scott. Scott? Oh, Scott! The water is wonderful. Why don't you come in? No... I'm a land animal. - You look very special. - Oh, that's the ocean, darling. How many times have you been in love, Sheil-o? Oh, darling... I can't remember in this heat. - Why? - Curiosity. Well, let's see, now. Well, there was a titled gentleman, and he sent me roses. There was, uh... a captain of industry. He invested my money. And there was a sailor, and he took me boating. You're angry, Scott? Don't stop now. You're up to the sailor. - Well, I... I was just joking. - Well, go on. Well... Darling, it was all so many years ago and I was just a silly girl. You know me, you know how I exaggerate. Exaggerate? I actually lie... now and then. I just wanted to see how you'd react. It's all right. I've been to college. I can stand a few small truths. Oh, come on, Scott. Be nice. All right... Nice. What kind of a girl were you when you were growing up? I mean, before... the sailor took you boating. Scott! Graham. What kind of a name is that? Is it a Scotch name? German? I... I don't know. Your father, what was he in? Business? And your mother, what kind of a woman was she? She died when you were 17. That's what you said, isn't it? Yes. - London? - Yes. - What part of London? - The... the West End. Well, were you... were you a... a little little girl or a big little girl? Did you wear pigtails with ribbons on them? Did you go to nice schools? - What sort of schools...? - Stop it! Stop it! Sheil-o! Sheil-o, I'm sorry. If there's something you don't want to tell me, then don't tell. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Leave me alone. Why do you keep questioning me? Sheil-o, because I love you. Because I want to know everything about you. Oh, God... I cannot... I cannot go on lying to you. Not any more. I was brought up in an orphanage. I was born in a slum. When I was 17 I went to work as a kitchen maid. It's all made up. The beautiful, rich mother, Sir Richard in his pink coat... Even the pictures, they're all fake. Even my name. It isn't Scotch, it isn't German. It's just common. Lily Shiel. That's my name - Lily Shiel. Sheil-o... Sheil-o, why on earth...? What difference does it...? Because I didn't want to be drab. Because I was afraid. Sheil-o, that's enough. That's enough. Lots of people don't like their lives so they make up better lives. That's all you did. And all of it, every bit of it... Everything that you were and everything that you are makes you that much dearer to me. Oh... But, Scott, I couldn't go through life being Lily Shiel. You... you asked me if I wore pigtails. Pigtails! Our heads were shorn! They were shorn to the bone. And I was so ugly and I didn't want to be. - I wanted to be beautiful and clever... - You are. I wanted to be accepted and to be loved and to be safe. You are, Sheil-o. All those things you are. I wish I had known you then. I would have taken care of you. - You could have come to me. - Yes, where were you then? There was no one to tell me right from wrong. No one! Stop crying, Sheil-o. I love you very much. I love you as you are. As you are. My days only begin when you come into this house. I'm jealous of every second spent with anybody else. That's fine with me. Let's be hermits together. We won't go out again till New Year's Eve. Not even then. I felt so lost this evening at dinner when you and Stan and Bob and everybody were all discussing the Thirty Year War. I'm English, and you're discussing English history and I can't even join in. I never even went past elementary school, and I'm hideously aware of the fact. My column isn't even grammatical. I'm beginning to hate the whole thing. Every self-respecting writer feels that way about his work sometime or another. I've been working for two weeks on the copy of my first radio broadcast. I've got to send it to John Wheeler in New York. I don't know - every time I rewrite it it seems more rubbishy than the last. Let's have a look at it. - Would you, darling? - Sure. Would you? Here it is. You don't mind if I reword it here and there? No. No, of course not. Here. Put the magazine under it. - Just for instance, huh? - Mm-hm. That's funny. That's good. Don't you think it'll be a bit over their heads? Don't you believe it, Sheil-o. If you give them your best, they'll love you for it. A little gossip is all right, but mix it up. Toss in an idea once in a while. Don't be afraid to make people use their minds. I wish I could learn to use mine. It hasn't been exposed to a serious idea or book in its life. How would you like it if I were to... make out a sort of a reading list? We could go through some of the really good books. Literature, politics, modern and ancient history. You can make notes and we can discuss them together. - Could we, darling? I would love that. - Of course we could. Do me good too. The beauty of literature is that it's ageless. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you're not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong. Oh, I do so want you to be proud of me. You know, up until now, I've always felt the only thing I had to be was beautiful... pretty, that people would accept me for no other reason. And there's always been that fear of being discarded when I grew old. Beautiful young people are accidents of nature, Sheil-o. Beautiful old people create themselves. One of the most attractive women I've ever met was a belle of 80 winters. Oh, heavens! Then the sooner I start my lessons the better. All right. Let's start on English literature. Say... a good rousing play by Shakespeare. Well, for the first night, could the pupil make the choice? What have you got in mind? Well, current literature. With special reference to a passage from Tender is the Night, by my favourite author, F. Scott Fitzgerald. I'd hardly call him current, but nevertheless, my loyal little public... proceed. "Nicole smiled at him, making sure that the smile gathered up everything inside her and directed it toward him, making him a profound promise of herself for so little, for the beat of a response. " "Minute by minute, the sweetness drained down into her out of the willow trees. " Sounds better now than when I wrote it. It's those damn willow trees. They'll do it every time. Oh, I suppose women from eight to 80 have been throwing themselves at you as long as you can remember. You little witch. I suppose you think a writer has to experience everything he writes about. I sweated blood getting that on paper. All you do is... Listen. " She stood up, and stumbling over the phonograph, was momentarily against him... " Ohh... "... leaning into the hollow of his rounded shoulder. " Lay off Fitzgerald and start on Shakespeare. I'll take a living author any day. I knew it. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. I absolutely must find the little hollow in that rounded shoulder. Oh, you must? - Well, lesson number one. - Oh, no... Ow! Don't needle the professor. - Is the conference over? - Are they ever? I'll be right back. This is... ...Hitler's troops goose-stepped into Vienna. Ex-Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg was reported to be under arrest. Following an ultimatum by the Austrian Nazi leader, the Fatherland Front forces were disarmed and the swastika flown over public buildings. - That's the world news today. - Ten seconds, Miss Graham. You have to allow 30 seconds for the switchover from Chicago. Wait for my hand signal. Now to Hollywood and Miss Sheilah Graham with the latest news from filmland. G- good evening. This is Sheilah Graham from Hollywood. Mr. Sam Goldwyn, who is as well known for his wit as for his excellent films, was hunting for a comedy to star Eddie Cantor. He received a call from a writer who told him he had the perfect comedy for Cantor. Not only was it a good comedy, the writer insisted, but it also had a message. "Just write me a comedy," said the witty Mr. Goldwyn. "Messages are for Western Union. " - Sheil-o? - Scott! Oh, Scott... It was a shambles. I'm so miserable. - Don't be silly, darling. You were fine. - You're lying and I love you for it. I wish you'd been with me. Anybody would be nervous the first time. - Next week you'll be over it. - There isn't going to be a next week. Mr. Robinson of the network called from Chicago. They liked the material, but not my voice. They're going to use a radio actress. - That's ridiculous. - I know. I argued with them. I told them that what made me nervous was the wait, that 30-second delay, but he's set on it - he's going to use an actress. Oh, he is, is he? Over my dead body. You'll go right back to Chicago, Sheilah, and do the show from there. Sheilah, there are times when you just have to fight back. You'll go to Chicago and you'll do the show yourself. And I'm going with you. Oh, Scott... Oh, that'd be wonderful. I feel so completely different when I'm with you. But, Scott, you can't leave your work for four whole days. They can have conferences until I get back. All they want. I'm no good in conferences anyway. I was with them for seven hours today. Talk, talk, talk. Nothing but confusion. I'm going with you. I'll arrange it. Oh... Oh... What would I do without you? - Hello, Miss Clayton. - Hello, Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Harris in? Yes, but Mr. Foster is with him right now. I wonder if I might see him for a minute. I'm sure he'll see you. Mr. Fitzgerald is here and would like to see you for just a moment. Thank you. - You may go right in. - Thank you. - Hello, Stan. - Come in, Scott. - Hi, Scott. - Sam. I'm sorry to interrupt. I wanted to tell you I'm going to Chicago for a few days. Oh? I'd like to get away from the script for a few days. I'm a little too close to it. But I'll be back on Thursday. I'll check with you. Oh, Scott. Sit down a minute, will you? - Will you excuse us, Sam? - Surely, Stan. Sit down. I was going to talk to you tomorrow. But since you're going away, I think I may as well tell you now. I've had to make a decision, Scott. I'm taking you off the picture. Are you shelving the picture? Not going ahead with it? No, we're going ahead with the picture, but with another writer. I'm sorry. You mean I'm fired? You're a great novelist, but screenwriting, well... Frankly you just don't seem to have the knack for it. You've had four assignments and you've failed on every one. Four scripts, but not a single picture. You write beautiful prose, Scott, but we can't photograph adjectives. I like having you around, but I can't justify keeping you on salary. Take my advice. Go back to writing novels. But you said that you loved... you loved what I was doing. Sure. Some of it reads great, but... it doesn't sound like dialogue, like people talking. If there's one thing in this world I do know, it's the voice and sound of my generation. I thought so too on some of it, but it just doesn't come off. - But I'm almost through. Let me finish. - Scott, I've got a deadline to meet. A starting date on the picture. I can't take that risk. All right. You just tell me how you want it written and I'll write it. Me tell F. Scott Fitzgerald how to write? All right, Stan. I'll be seeing you. Scott. As a novelist, in my opinion, you still have no equal. Sure. Well, thanks for everything, Stan. Best of luck. - Goodbye, Miss Clayton. - Goodbye, Mr. Fitzgerald. Miss Sheilah Graham. Miss Sheilah Graham. Will you come to the TWA ticket desk, please? Miss Graham? This message just came in for you. - Oh. - You may use the phone in my office. Oh, that's very kind of you. Darling, it's long distance from New York. It shouldn't take a minute. United Airlines flight 3 to Bakersfield, Fresno, Oakland and San Francisco now loading at gate 1. All aboard, please. It was John Wheeler, darling. He'll meet us in Chicago. And he's so glad you're coming. He said it would be like old times. I'll have a brandy, please. For the takeoff. I'll have another double gin. For the takeoff. Scott, what are you doing? I've never seen you drink. Well, you're seeing me now. Scott, what's the matter with you? Please tell me. Nothing's the matter. Everything's for the best in the best of worlds. - Another time around, Charlie. - Oh, no, please, Scott. Please, darling, tell me what's wrong. No, don't... don't. TWA flight 6 to Albuquerque, Kansas City and Chicago now loading at gate 3. All aboard, please. Come on, Sheil-o. Let's go. Let's fly. Let's fly. Oh, Scott. Please, if you're going to be any help to me at all... Shh... Would you like a magazine? No, but I'd like to sell something to one of them. Do you know who I am? No, sir. I don't have my passenger list. Never mind, I'll tell you. I am F. Scott Fitzgerald, - and she is Sheilah... - Scott, please. For heaven's sake. Scott, stop it. Sir, do you know who I am? - No. Who are you? - I am F. Scott Fitzgerald. Surely you've heard of my books, The Great Gatsby... uh... plenty of others, haven't you? Oh, yes. Of course I've heard of you. You see that? He's heard of me. He's heard of me. And how about you, sir? Have you heard of me? Can't say as I ever have. You're fired. You're fired! F. Scott Fitzgerald... I'm so thrilled to meet my favourite author in person. I never thought I'd be speaking to you of all people. I've always visualised you as being just as handsome, daring and romantic a figure as any of the heroes in your books. And, you know, you haven't disappointed me one bit. You're even more so. Even more so. You know my works, do you? Every single line you ever wrote. You silly brat. Scott, I wish you would get off here and catch the next plane back to Hollywood. It was a mistake for you to come. You're in no condition to help me. I can get on much better in Chicago on my own. Oh, please, Scott, you're making me very unhappy. Please get off here and go home. Fine, Sheil-o, fine. I shall get off as you suggest. No problem. No problem. You fight your battle and I'll fight my battle - alone. All alone. Lone wolves, you and me, Sheil-o. Lone wolves. Lone wolves. TWA flight 6... Kansas City, Chicago... aboard, please. - Hello. - Oh, Scott... Oh, Scott, I'm so glad you're back. I shouldn't have said that. Darling, I'm sorry. I love you, I love you. Oh, I'm so glad you didn't get off. Oh, I got off. - I got another bottle. - Oh, Scott... - Scott! - Really! Mr. Fitzgerald, please! - Oh, Scott... - Please, Mr. Fitzgerald. - Sheilah! - John, darling. - Good to see you. You look wonderful. - Thank you. - This is Ted Robinson from the network. - Oh, yes. The enemy. - Come in, Mr. Robinson, and sit down. - Thank you. You mustn't think of Ted as the enemy. Let's see if we can't work this out. Yes, fine. I, um... I just know I can do the broadcast beautifully, Mr. Robinson, if I don't have that terrifying half-minute wait. Miss Graham, as programme director I am responsible for maintaining... - Hiya, Scott. - Hey, John-o. Uh... Mr. Robinson, this is Mr. Fitzgerald. How do you do? Just go right ahead, Mr. Robinson. Go right ahead. The problem, of course, is your delivery. Yes, I know. I was very, very nervous. But I still say that half-minute wait - it seems like an eternity... Your nervousness is not what disturbs us. If I may be so frank, the large part of our audience is Western and Midwestern. Their ear is not attuned to a British accent. Why don't you try sticking an ear of corn in your mouth? We require of our broadcasters a language that is reduced to its purest and most understandable level. Oh, that is a very heavy responsibility, Mr. Robinson. You see, Miss Graham, we cannot have you English coming over here contaminating our beautiful language. Oh, Scott, please. Cut it out, Scott. Be yourself. John, that's about the worst advice you can give me right now. Come on, Mr. Robinson, does she go on or doesn't she? I'm sorry, Miss Graham. Excuse me. I'm sorry, Mr. Wheeler. I can't... Let's go to your office and settle the matter. I'm most terribly, terribly sorry. - Join us when you can. - Yes. Now, now, Warden. Before you switch on the current, the prisoner has a statement to make. Business tactics, my darling. - Business tactics. - Oh... Scott, what am I going to do with you? But, Ted, what's to be lost if you give her one more try? I can't take the responsibility. Good morning, Miss Arden. Miss Arden is here. She has an excellent reading voice. She's familiar with the material and I'm sure you'll approve our choice. Ted, what would the Louella Parsons Show be without Louella? I admit it would be preferable if Miss Graham did it. Couldn't you possibly give me one run-through right now? Then if you're not satisfied, well, you have Miss Arden, and I'll go back to Hollywood and no hard feelings. I'll agree to that. We haven't much time. Charlie, have Miss Arden wait in studio A. - Miss Graham, whenever you're ready. - Yes. Miss Arden, would you be kind enough to wait in studio A, please? We're going to give Miss Graham a run-through. OK, Miss Graham, let's get a level, please. Good evening. This is Sheilah Graham from Hollywood. Perfect! Perfect, Sheil-o. Just great! Oh, Scott, please. Oh, Sheil-o, don't be afraid of them. There's nothing to be afraid of, Sheil-o. I'll get him out of here right away. Scott, will you please sit down and be quiet? Level's fine, Miss Graham. Now for a complete run-through. Ready? - Start. - Now, Sheil-o. Don't be nervous. Just be yourself. Your darling... lovely... bewitching... self. That's all you have to do, darling. Just absolutely... be yourself. Hello, John. What can I do for you? - Let's go back to the hotel, Scott. - Fine. Fine. As soon as I get Sheil-o straightened out. Now, darling, let's try it again. This time, remember... Just relax. Come on, darling... Give us that great big smile. Be my own Sheil-o. Good evening... This is Sheilah Graham from Hollywood. The newlyweds Fredric March and Florence Eldridge got two tickets in the mail from an unknown benefactor. It was for the opening night of the stage play Hamlet, starring Leslie Howard, and... as tickets were hard to come by... Now you've got it, Sheil-o. That was it, that was wonderful. - Wasn't that just great, John? - Just great. Come on, Scott. You've got it, Sheil-o. It's in the bag. You can't miss. You see what I mean, John? It's the secret of all great performers. You just have to be yourself. Take anyone you name - Jack Barrymore, Bernhardt, Duse, Lunt and Fontanne, Helen Hayes. One secret. What is it? Nothing to it. Just themselves. Now, Miss Graham, everything's all right. Let's go right on. Oh, John. Where is he? He's asleep. I was just leaving you a note. Oh... John... It's just awful that you had to be dragged into all this. Hell, don't worry about me. It's my first experience with Scott like this, and I... I am absolutely furious with him. All things considered, I think the poor guy hasn't behaved too badly. I like that. What am I supposed to do? Go in there and wake him up and apologise? Sheilah, don't you know that he's lost his job? Been fired at the studio? Fired? But he... but he didn't tell me. He didn't say a word. Worst possible time for this to happen. Zelda, the hospital bills, the daughter, his self-confidence... Everything gone. And here I've been worrying about my stupid little broadcast. Oh... John... I've got to help him. What shall I do? Well, get a doctor. He'll probably recommend a sanitarium until he gets over this. John, I can't do that. No, I can't do that to him. Oh, my poor darling, I... Oh, John, help me. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Hello, darling. How are you feeling? Oh... Better than I should. - Doctor Hoffman been here today? - Yes. I'm riddled with punctures and filled with vitamins. Scott, what are we going to do about us? Drinking frightens me. I... Darling, I'll take the bad with the good, but I feel that perhaps... first I should know just how much of it there's going to be. You've seen the end of it. I'm going back to work. I already called my agent about another picture assignment. Darling, do you know something? I don't want you to write any more screenplays. This place isn't right for you. You should be where it's quiet, with no distractions, so you've got a chance to do what you do best, and that's write novels. You've been taking notes on a novel about Hollywood and you should start writing. Serious writing takes time. Time. There are certain obligations that I must meet. You know that Zelda's in a sanitarium. I can't allow her to be put into an asylum. I can't. And Scottie is in... the most crucial stage of her education right now. So I must have a certain sum of money coming in regularly. Writing a novel... It takes time... time. Yes, I know, darling, and I've been thinking about that too. I think I have a solution. I do hope you're going to like it. Do you know what I've done? I've rented a house at Malibu Beach - away from all this. With six weeks of concentrated effort, you could write enough to get a big advance from any publisher. That would solve your problems, wouldn't it? Oh, Scott, it's a lovely little house. Just the sound of the surf and the gulls and... - What do you think? - Well, it sounds good. It might work. I am intrigued by the tycoons of this industry. There's a good theme in it. When shall we go? Well... right now. All right. Come on, I'll help you pack. That won't take long. I'll get the luggage. You know... I've always felt that Hollywood had a wonderful kind of foolish grandeur, like an Italian court in the Renaissance. It's got its kings, clowns, wicked princes and clever mistresses, all in a ferment of ambitious motion. And its scribes, chroniclers and gossips like me. - What are you doing with this? - Oh. I had that in Baltimore. We had prowlers around the place once. I think that the theme would be the conflict between one superior man and all the petty angry forces that try to tug him down, drag him down, make him settle for less than the best, something they can understand. Probably in the end they'd destroy him. What is this? - It's a bull's tail. - Of course. But what on earth for? What for? Juan Belmonte gave me that in Madrid in 1926. Ugh... You've been lugging it around ever since? Yeah. Ever since. I can't throw a thing like that away. - Hello, darling. - Hello, Sheil-o. - How'd it go today? - Pretty good. Pretty good. My literary agent called from New York. When I've got four chapters ready, he wants to submit them to the Saturday Evening Post and to Collier's. Darling, that's wonderful. I knew it was the right thing for you to move down here. Oh, I am so pleased. What kind of a day did you have? Oh, not bad. I finally got an interview with Garbo. And then I went back to the office, wrote my column. And I spoke to John Wheeler in New York. What did he have to say? Well, he thought it wouldn't be a bad idea if I went to New York. Oh? What for? Oh, there's an annual publishers' convention. He thought I should go back for it and perhaps pick up a few new outlets for my column. Is there anyone in particular that you'd like to see in New York? Surely you don't think...? Oh, don't be ridiculous. Sheil-o... Come here. Come here. Listen very carefully to what I say because I mean every word of it. If you leave me now and go to New York, don't come back to me. Why, Scott... - You can't possibly mean that. - Yes, I mean it. I don't want you to go to New York, Sheil-o. Darling, of course I won't go if you don't want me to. It's just that I'm... I'm a working girl and I've got my future to think of. Sheil-o... What you've been looking for all your life you've found. You've been looking for love and understanding - you told me. I understand you, and I love you. Must I come out and say it? You're the most important thing in my life. Oh, Scott, say that again. Please say that again. It's what I've wanted to hear and what I've needed to know. Oh, you mean everything to me. I have all the excitement I need right here with you and nothing else matters to me. Nothing. I love you, darling, I love you. Sheil-o... You must have felt... You must know how very much I want to marry you. How is it you never asked about what's going to happen to us? Well, a Graham is a trusting animal. It makes a fine house pet. It's easily trained and likes to play games and fetch a stick or the morning paper. And it never asks questions. Does it trust? Yes, it does. It took Tolstoy four years to write that. If he'd wanted the ending first he wouldn't have started it. I know it's sacrilegious, but you must admit it is rather long. It is rather, isn't it? The mailman come yet? No, darling, he hasn't. Here it is. Chapters one, two, three, four, ready for New York. Oh, darling, it's wonderful! Remember what the little bookseller said? "They'll come back to you, Mr. Fitzgerald. " They'll be welcome. I'll sit right here with Mr. Tolstoy, darling, until the mailman comes. Ho, there! It's very important. See it gets in the first mail. Yes, ma'am. Sheil-o! Oo-oo! Ah! And another one for old Fitz-harris. Extremely well expressed. - Ship ahoy! - Anchors aweigh. Down the hatch. I have a present for you. Come on. Something very special. Try this on, old sport. Just climb into this. There we are. Perfect. Positively elegant. I'll drink to the best-dressed man in the room. You, sir, Mr. Fitz-simmons, are a gentleman. And I know a gentleman when I see a gentleman. Me too. Coming from you, sir, I regard that as the supreme compliment. Did you fellas tell me that you have a housing problem? Well, it is solved forthwith. You stay here with me and be my houseguests. Houseguests? That's wonderful! Hello, Sheil-o. Come on in and join us. Why, Scott. What's going on here? Who are these people? Why, Sheil-o, these are my friends. This is Mr... Mr. S... Smedley-Jones. Yeah... And this is... Mr... Mr. Darby-Forsyth. I thought you'd like to meet them, Sheil-o. They're sailors. - And, gentlemen, the lady is... - I think you'd better leave. Take the suits and ties and books, anything else he's given you, and leave them here. - Have to? - Immediately. Sheil-o... I warn you, don't talk like that to my friends. He gave us this stuff. Ain't that right? Certainly I did. I'm no Indian giver. Come on. Get them off and get out. Otherwise I'll call the police. Police? That will not be necessary. The young lady wants us to shove off. See you, old pal! If we're not around the beach, look us up at Freddie's Bar. Get out. If you don't mind, I'll see my friends out. Listen, you fellas. You come back here, any time... any time. - Bye, Sheil-o. - Bye. Never do that to me again. Scott... Scott... Scott, please. Please. I'll invite whomever I want whenever I want. Scott, have you eaten anything? No! Stop mothering me and smothering me. Scott, if you won't let me care for you, I'll call Dr Hoffman. Call him, don't call him, I don't care. I don't need anybody to look after me! - In that case I'm leaving. - Oh, no, you don't. You'll stay right here until I say so. - I want to go. - You'll stay! Right here! Scott... My darling phoney. Scott... My phoney darling. My fine lady from the slums. - Sheilah Graham. - No... Ho, ho, ho, ho! - You're just plain silly Lily Shiel. - No, Scott, stop it. - Lily Shiel. - Stop it. Lily Shiel. Lily Shiel. Scott, I hate you! I don't love you any more or respect you any more! - I'm gonna kill you! Where's my gun? - Oh, no! - I'm gonna kill you. - No! - Where's my gun? - I don't know! Where is it? Oh, God! Oh! Open the door! Open up! Operator! Operator! Get me the police. This is my address. It's 31... Oh, Scott! Scott, stop it! Stop it, Scott! Scott, I've called the police and there'll be a terrible scandal. Stop it! No! Agh! Oh! No! No! Scott, don't! Don't! Don't! You go on. Go on. Take it. Shoot. Go on! Do it! I don't care what happens to you! You're not worth saving. You're not worth anything. I didn't drag myself up from the gutter to waste myself on a worthless drunk like you! Worthless! Worthless! I hate you! I hate you! - How is he, Doctor? - He's quiet for the moment. I gave him an injection... 3cc of medication. - Coffee? - Thanks. - Cream? - No, thanks. - How serious is this? - Doctor. Doctor! Doctor? Doctor, will you do something? - Try to be calm. - But my arms are numb. Give the medication a chance to work... How long will I be like this? That all depends. Might never happen again. On the other hand, if you continue to drink, your heart can take just so much, and you might be paralysed for life. Then I'll blow my brains out. Who'd hold the gun? Might not even need a gun. The Good Lord tapped you on the shoulder, Scott. Let it be a warning to you. - I'll drop by in the morning. - Thanks. - Good night, Bob. - Good night, Doctor. You know, he's right. You can't go on like this. It's only going to make things worse. Yeah, I know. Oh, God. Don't I know. I'd like to get out of it. But how? Where? I'm finished. Well, Emerson said it pretty well. "On the debris of our despair, we build our character. " So, the Collier's and Post turned down your book. But not really - just the first couple of chapters. Maybe they didn't grasp what you're after. All right, finish it. Prove to 'em you still have it. Yes, hello? Sheilah, this is Scott. Sheilah? Sheilah? Please talk to me. Then for the last two days he's been bombarding me with letters and telephone calls at two and three in the morning. He sent a telegram to John Wheeler urging him to have me sent back to England. Why? If John refused he threatened to have me deported. Oh, that's just the nature of the beast. I am finished. But really. I have had Mr. Fitzgerald and his charm and his liquor and his genius. I have had it up to here. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm positive. You don't know what it's been like. I can't work. I can't sleep. - Why don't you get a lawyer? - Hm? Yeah, take him into court. No, hire a couple of detectives. They'll pay a call on Mr. F and promise to throw him in jail if he doesn't stop annoying you. - Could I do that? - For a hundred bucks. - I've got to get my sunglasses. - I'll do anything... to stop those telephone calls. - I'll do anything! - They'll stop him, all right. A visit from the gendarmes just before dawn can be a nice little persuader. They'll start by pounding on his door about 5am... - But they can't do that. - They can't do what? Pound on his door at that hour. He'd just be falling asleep, and he sleeps so badly. Uh... Look, wouldn't you like a drink? The next best thing to seeing you was to spend the afternoon here in the surroundings which have brought me so much happiness. I loved you with everything I had, but something was terribly wrong. We were doomed, I'm afraid, from the start. I said and did awful things, but what I cannot bear is the thought that you trusted me and I betrayed you. I cannot bear the thought that I gave grief to you when I wanted to give joy. I'm glad you're rid of me. I hope you're happy, and that the last impression will fade a little with time. Goodbye, Sheil-o. Sheil-o. Sheil-o. Sheil-o. Yes? Thank you, Sheil-o. I must... see you. Well, I... I want... to talk to you too. I'll pick you up, darling. We'll drive somewhere where we can talk. I'm through with the drinking and... I'm finished with it for good. The escape is much more horrible than the reality. I know you... I know you mean what you say now, but... how long will it last? How do I...? I've never promised before. Not to you and not even to myself. I'm through drinking, Sheil-o. I've started writing again on The Last Tycoon. It's going to be the best thing that I've ever done, thanks to you. I love you, Scott. I love you as you are now. But that other Scott, I... Well, it was a nightmare. I couldn't stand that again, I really couldn't. Even if you don't take me back - and I want you very, very much - I'm through... drinking. Through, through. Yes, but how... how can I be sure? How can I believe? How can I know? Test me. Don't just take my word for it. Test me. Psst! Hey. You have been at it all day. You must stop now. Yes, I will. It's... it's a very special chapter. It's... very special. Rather personal. It's... Well, it's about us, about you and me. It's about us? Oh, darling! - Read it to me. - Well, I'd like to. I'll see if I can find the place where you and I first meet. Yes, here it is. I've christened you Kathleen, and I'm called Monroe Stahr. Yes, here it is. "Stahr and Kathleen danced. " "When she came close, his several visions blurred. " "She was momentarily unreal. " "Stahr continued to be dazzled as they danced out along the floor. " "She was deep in it with him, no matter what the words were. " "Her eyes invited him to a romantic communion of unbelievable intensity. " "As if she realised this, she said, frightened, 'I must go back'." "Stahr held her close. " "'I don't want to lose you. Couldn't we have dinner?'" "She dropped her arms and looked at him, a laughing wanton. " "'When I'm with you I don't breathe quite right', she said. " "She picked up her long dress and turned. " "'Thank you for the dance', she said. " "'And now, really, good night'." "Then she nearly ran. " Oh... It is us, isn't it? I never realised that you'd... Oh... Read me some more. There is another part I'd like to read to you, but... I have to polish it first. It's... Tomorrow night. It's the part where Kathleen is being educated by Stahr. He's given her a schedule of books to be read. - Sound slightly familiar? - Yes, slightly. Well, am I... that wonderful all the way through? Haven't you written about the times when I'm so stupid and foolish and silly? Let's celebrate tonight. What do you say we go out? - Would you like to? - Mm-hm. You know what? I've had an invitation to a private showing at the Fox studio. It's nothing big, very informal. Some of the industry and a few press. It might be fun. It's a comedy. A comedy sounds good. Is it a funny comedy? Well, it's said to be hilarious. - Boa noite, night is through - See, see, see, see, see the moon above - Soon I'll dream and when I do - Way, way, way, way up in the blue I'll dream my way into your arms again So boa noite Until then Oh, there they are. Scott, what's the matter? I feel awful. Awful. - Darling, stay here for a minute. - No, let's go. - People might think I'm drunk again. - No, darling. Nobody saw. Lean on me. - Let me call the doctor... - Hello, Sheilah, Scott. Haven't seen you. Where have you been? He's working on the most exciting novel. Wonderful. If there's a picture in it, be sure and let me read it. - Scott, let me call Dr Hoffman. - Talk to me. Make conversation. - I can't... - Hello, Scott. How are you? Hello. Help me. Do it. Talk to me. Uh... Bob Carter had a funny row with the police last night. They stopped him outside Chasen's restaurant making a U-turn... - Hello, Sheilah, darling. - Hello. They asked his name and he said, "Peter Rabbit. " Then he told them he lived in a lettuce patch. And he was... he was very indignant he had to spend the night in the police station. How do I look? Oh, Scott, please let me call Dr Hoffman. I'm going to see him tomorrow anyway. Darling, let me drive. Thanks, Sheil-o. Germany, Italy and Japan have signed a mutual aid pact. Well, that means we're going to be in the war, sooner or later. I'd like to go to Europe. Get a job as a war correspondent. Oh, you coward. You needn't think you'll get away from me by going to cover a war. I'm going with you. We'll go lots of places together, when things get back to normal. I'll take you anywhere you'd like to go. Oh, I'd love that, darling. I'd love to go to Europe with you. I'd see everything for the first time. I didn't really see anything anyway until you opened my eyes. Well, six chapters nearly finished. If everything goes well, the book will be on the stands by early spring. It's going to be a hit. It's going to be a great hit and you know it. You just had to set your mind to it and stay with it. That's all you needed. What I needed was a letter from the publisher saying the book had been accepted, and the big cheque that came in the envelope with it. I'm one of those birds that thrives on success. Some people need to be shaken up by failure now and then to be at their best. Not me. I've got some ideas for the next book, and it's a book that could be written anywhere. What would you say, for instance, to... Italy when things clear up over there? Oh, heavenly. I'd love it. I owe you so much, Sheil-o. I'll make it up to you. I'll make it all up to you. Darling? What do you say we make a rule? Every time you're... Scott! Oh, Scott... Oh! Hello. Dr Hoffman, please. Oh, well... well, can you find him, please, quickly? Mr. Fitzgerald has... has fainted. Please ask him to come up here as quickly as possible. Yes, thank you. Scott! Oh! Oh, no! Help me! Someone! Help me! Oh, help! Help me, someone! Help me! Help! Help! Please help me! Oh, please help me! Something terrible has happened! It's Scott! Come! Extension 118, the coroner. Give me extension 115, the coroner. No, I want the coroner. He's dead. Sheil-o. Sheil-o. I love you. I love you very much. I love you as you are. As you are. I hear your voice in the song of the breeze And I rejoice in the chance to reprise Those breathless moments when love cast its spell In the sound of the surf on the shore Beloved infidel I see your face when I look at a star And I embrace all the things that you are My love for you time can never dispel Oh, my beloved... Beloved infidel
