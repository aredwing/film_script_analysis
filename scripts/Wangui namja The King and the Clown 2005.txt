Lasting over 500 years, its uniqueness under the reign of 27 kings still remains unmatched in the annals of word history. To each King were assigned several Royal Secretaries whose function was to keep a diary on behalf of the King. Upon the King's passing, Court Historians edited these exhaustive records for posterity, including succeeding Kings. The massive collection of these edited diaries, called "The Royal Records of the Chosun Dynasty" has survived intact, The King of this story, the Records show, was singularly tyrannical: No king before or after him shared his excesses. Nonetheless, the Records also give us a portrait of him as a man of great sensitivity and intelligence. Produced by JUNG Jin-wan, Directed by LEE Jun-ik When he was a child, his mother was ordered to commit suicide by poison after falling victim to court machinations. Her death left a lasting trauma on the future king's psyche. No doubt, this trauma played a significant role in the deformation of his character. On September 2, 1506, he was dethroned violently after a revolt by the nobles. To be up here, away from the bustle, My legs like wings would spread! Ahoy! What is that flower in full bloom I see yonder? Dost thou not recognize the one and only! So it is! The one and only! With rose petal'd lips! O friend, beat thee thy leather while I go pick the flower. Hee haw! My, my, there comes a fool, rash and proud! Never knew a fool who knew his place! Ho! A tongue most untamed! Master of this house am I, come to bait thee! A gallows-hung scoundrel is what I see. With an ill-fitting coat to hide his sores! Oh thorny Rose, is thy Iris closed for me? Open them, and see as I walk the Master's gait. Oh, really! Good Heavens! Me thought it would be a mere hop and a skip. But t'was longer than a runny trip to the outhouse! Master gait, master bait, either way strains the balls! And now, a fornicating wench running off upon being surprised. 'Tis thy own form, saucy wench. I was expecting to see thee fall and crack thy frame. But not bad! Indeed, gifted are my two legs, but it is my third that has true genius. And thou shall see it this night! Master wants to see you. Thy twin eggs, are they cracked yet, or just in the crack? Safely in the crack... Plugging my bunghole! But now, I must drain my bladder. I gotta pee before I continue! Why, you dirty boor! So then, let's try it on for size! Good idea! I shall oblige! You promised us a meal! We ain't squirrels! Be thankful you weren't thrown out! Don't go, Gong-gil! There are things you shouldn't sell! Let go. Move it! What kind of life is that? Mister fuckin' Righteous, eh! Stop it! Let go! Let go! Gong-gil wants to go, so what's it to you? Stop pimping off of Gong-gil. You piece of shit! Want us to starve to death? Go fuck yourself, and spare me your high tone bullshit. I won't let you! Hey, it's a dog-eat-dog world out there. Just mind your own business. You... you are... Come on out. Somebody help me! Get up. Let go. OK, fine. Let's die together. This way, this way! Get th-th-those bastards! Now! Go after them! Go after them! You're only making it worse. Let us go, please. Grab them. I beg you, let us go. You piece of shit. Shut your trap. You shit! Let go, you fuck! I'll make sure you never walk again. No! Give me your hand. Will he be okay? That dog deserves to die. Ouch... ow... Hey, watch where you're going! Hey, watch where you're going! Sprained your eyes, did ya? Not my eyes, but my legs did comin' o'er the hill. Hey, you sound like Kang the Blind! And you stink like Bong the Blind! Well! Hail fellow, well met! Let's see, am I over here, and you over there? No, I'm over here and you over there. No, I'm here and you are there? I am here. You are there. - Where? Where? - Here. Here. Let's go to Seoul. And we'll put on a show to end all shows! This rice cake was just made. Are you going to be here tomorrow? Hey. Not you. The other you. What? What the hell are you doing? The three gods of childbirth put balls on the wrong person. Did you eat something rotten for breakfast? You would've been with the king if you hadn't had these. Stop saying nonsense, and tell my fortune instead. Tell me about my future. What about the fee? Fee? Touch all you want. Are my balls on the right person? I'm Jang Seng. My name is Jang Seng. Tell me if I'm going to live long and well. You two, break up! What do you mean break up? We're not married. Ouch, ow, ow... What's the matter? I haven't eaten in years. My head is spinning and can't see nothin' straight... I can't do this no more. - So it is. - What do you say folks? This cheeky fool says, No pay, no play. Shall we call it a day? We're the best showmen in town, just workin' for a livin'. Thank you, sir, thank you, thank you. You expect money for some crap like that? Do you folks want to see some real skill? Show us what you got. A cheap third-rate, but still not entirely without talent... A country bumpkin with ambition, I see... I guess I could teach you a thing or two. Watch and learn, eh? Sure. Napisy pobrane z NapisZone Talent like that will get you far. But, sorry to say, not with this sophisticated audience. Maybe you should retire. Don't you agree? This time it will be a pair-jump. Don't blink or you'll miss the action, eh? You bastards, I'll give you everything I have, so do whatever you want with it. Yahoo! Yahoo! Howdy, I'm Six Dix. He's Seven Ravin' and that one's Eight Pate. Say, where is the biggest show spot in Seoul? It's been a while sincethere was one. Why is that? Don't tell me you don't know? The King's cleared out half the city to double his hunting ground. With only half the people as before, there ain't gonna be no show. But there is another kind of show... Gosh, I feel just awful! I have 9! Raking in money like the King does virgins. Nah, I ain't that good yet. Now, let's see if I am as lucky as that tramp Nok-su. Who's Nok-su? Nok-su the Whore? The bitch has the King living inside her skirt. Before, she had every rich man living inside her skirt. Every dime I ever won went right into her bearded pouch. Here comes that awful feelin' again! I have 8! So where is my cut? Let's do this again tomorrow. It's only the first game, so, Captain... Mind if I call you 'Captain'? So, just like today, you... If I help you make more money tomorrow... Will you do as I say? Captain, don't start giving orders. So, what's your plan? We mock the King. The King? Did you not hear? In front of a cunt, every man kneels. Is the King any better than the rest of us? The King's bed, that's where the big money is. Just a minute. But how are we going to mock the king? And can we really do that? Why are you guys asking me? I don't know how but they said it's possible. Are you in or out? Well... You told me to talk like this. I ain't playing no eunuch! I got balls! This is bullshit. Forget it, I'm out. - Oh, man! - Come on! It's better than starving, I suppose. Go! Hurry up! "None" Eunuch Kim, what haste causes thee to jingle thy bells so? Hee haw! Jingle, shingle! Sure, if I had any! I'd jingle-jangle all the way! That's odd, I'm sure I heard jingles. Were they my bells, then? Wasn't it? Nok-su, Royal Consort - Isn't she the King's Consort? - Sure is. What on earth is that woman doing! People say, she a Lady now but she still shits like a horse. So then the rumors were true after all! That feels good! We hit the jackpot today! Bring it on! Bring everything! Captain, let's do the show everyday. No, 3 times a day! And rake it in! How about a drink, fellah? I swear, I never saw a fellah so shy. But man, he sure knows how to gyrate them hips! Captain, we should have done this earlier! Someone grabbed my balls thinking I really had none. It scared the shit out of me! I saw, I saw! To the Captain! I knew you'd over do it. Just say 'no' next time. Feel good? Yeah. What feels so good? It's all good. Hey, who's that? Deep blue water, Jang Rok Soo. Do you know what swims in that water? - A Stringray? - A covetous official. Sook Yong, what are you doing here? I'm trying to empty something in a hurry. And what are you doing here, your majesty? I'm doing a divine favor to the grass here, to help to grow thick and green. My belly! Her water broke! Adulterer There it is! I see the baby! Come on, push! Let's have a look. He has my forehead and my big nose too. This calls for a celebration! Hee haw! Thank you very much! Step back. Take these wretches to jail at once. What, did you expect a prize for mocking the King? Go see for yourself. Is it a crime to show what everyone already jokes about? How disrespectful! If it's about the King's "equipment"... he is the King after all. So we thought it ought to be King-size. Watch your tongue! Flog these fools! Wait! We can't die like this! Let us show it to the King. What? Keep flogging! Hold it! What did you say? If the King likes it, then we're innocent. We will make the King laugh. But if he does not... your heads will roll! Idiots that we are! We messed with the King! I got shit for brains, that's what! What insane King would find this amusing? In any case, it's a 'do or die'. So we're gonna die! Like dogs! I'd rather be flogged. The special event today... has been arranged for His Majesty's pleasure. Just relax and do what we always do. May it please you all. Hush. June 1st, 1504 As we jest, let ye mirth issue unimpeded. So we may live yet another day. Go. Eunuch... Kim... What haste... causes thee to jangle thy bells so? What the? Jingling my... balls? I... heard... M, m, my... balls? But I... ain't got none. Hee... haw! Hee haw! None Isn't that... the King's Consort? Sure, why... not? Rumor has it that the tramp... The wench... I mean, the Lady! Ah! That feels good! Come on, push! Captain, we're doomed! We're dead now! Let's have a look. He has my forehead and my big nose too. Let me have a look at you. Ho, ho, my son, my boy, my son. Come from Heaven or from the silent Earth? My pride, my boy, my son. So thou thinkest he's thy issue? What everyone knows, thou dost not. Then of whose loin is he? One of the eunuchs is still half a man. And he did his nightly rounds. Who is he? Spit it out! Spit with an empty mouth? You wily wench! Fine. I shall fill it! The one above or the one below? The one above. With teeth and tongue! Hear this! I shall suffer these clowns to entertain me from time to time. Prepare their quarters within the palace. This is where you'll stay. Don't touch. Dig in. But Captain, why does the King want to keep us here? Maybe to raise our status? We're minstrels, what does our status matter? A full tummy, that's what counts. Damn right. I thought we'd never eat! Shit! Who is gonna eat this now? It's still food, it won't kill you. It's good. - Come on now, work with me! - Hold me tighter! The one above or the one below? The one above. I'm coming! I'm coming! - Unload, my Lord! - I am spent! You know, the one who played me... You stared at him so intensely, as if to drill a hole in his face. A hole? But is he really a man? His skin is so fair. Not even eunuchs have it so fine. It is not advisable, Your Majesty. Every time, it's always "no, no, no." So what is allowed then? Why does Your Majesty wish their presence here? What is so wrong with keeping them here? According to the edict issued by the previous King... A show must suit the occasion that calls for one. The law covers such trivial matters as well? It does, Your Majesty. If Your Majesty insists on keeping them here... There will be protest upon protest. This cannot be allowed, Your Majesty. May Your Majesty reconsider. Cheo-seon! Am I King or not? Am I still King when my dead father still rules, huh? Your Majesty, calm yourself. The prudent hunter treads silently to capture the prey. So, the ministers want us out? But the King told us to stay. Wasn't that by a Royal order? They see you as vermin, to be gotten rid of as soon as possible. Had I known that the King was so powerless... I would not have bothered to mock him! So he laughed once, and now you think you own the world. Tell him, thanks for the snack. You had the guts to lampoon the King. So why not the ministers? So we're allowed to satirize them too? Then help me set up an audition for more minstrels. Clothes define the man! Ladies! Get in line! Are we to make fun of the ministers or make them laugh? Both. We fooled with the King and he laughed, right? So if we fool with the ministers, they'll laugh too. I see. But Captain, those ministers are just dying to kick us out. What if we get into trouble later? So we need to find the best minstrels and put on a show to blow them away. Right, Captain? Are you done? Wow, your writing looks exactly like Gong-gil's! Yeah! I learned to write by imitating his style, that's why. Minstrels Audition You're the man when it comes to imitating! Copy this and go paste them all over town. Now copy it exactly. What? What's so funny? It's just that... minstrels don't know how to read! Captain, trust me on this. Minstrels Audition at the Royal Palace Come on in, fellahs. What's going on? Hee haw! Over the lovely... You like being in the palace that much? Yeah, I'm floating on air, you bitch. You witch, you bitch! You'll get a hundred spanking if you beat your husband! You witch, you dreadful bitch! Here, my love! Next up is Choi from Pyong-yang! Break a leg! Hee haw! Yessiree! Sir, it is I. Do I know thee? I heard word about a vacant post. 'Tis for thee. It's a turtle of gold. Put it away! As I cannot... 'Tis nothing, I swear. I say, I cannot accept! 'Tis but a piss-colored metal! Hush. Is thy heart immovable? Indeed, as a mountain! Truly? Verily not? May Heaven fall asunder! No! You're a tough nut to crack! Fine, then! Hey, your technique is too crude! I must return home but I am broke. So, take it for a nickel. In that case... I'll buy two. Sir, about my husband... Madam, not in this manner. It's all I have, sir. Please, no, no... This will bring only trouble. Sir, it's a token of my esteem. What dost thou take me for? Such firmness! Just as I've been told. Be gentle, madam! Such a precious gift! Let my hands speak for me. As a token of my... Keep going. Let me have a look. I dislike odd-shaped things. But something like this might do. Like this? You shall have it! You just don't get it, do you! Look. Like this. Like this. I've got it! Here! Exactly. Here we go! Hee haw! To you, my lords! Lighten your hearts and enjoy! What's the matter? A pang of conscience, perhaps? Most certainly. So who is it? Is it you? I hear song and dance never stops at your house. That is not so, Your Majesty! Then you perhaps? A retinue of over 100 virgins on your trip to Pyongyang? Never, Your Majesty! So it's you then? How now! Spill the cup given by the King? Forgive me, Your Majesty! Forgive you for what? Even your sentry demands bribes, I hear. So, my wine is not good enough for you? Have mercy, Your Majesty! I grew up in poverty as a child... So you sold titles for money? So was I a fool to give you one for free? Share thy profit, you ungrateful cur! Dismiss him from the Ministry, and seize all his property. And... Cut off all his fingers, and you ministers shall see them at hand. What is your name? I am Gong-gil, Your Majesty. Goodness! Comedy in a bloodbath! Nice going! I hope we don't get hurt in the end! The King was amused, so what's the worry? Yeah, but he can be so cruel! It makes me nervous! Wrap it up and go to bed. Why did the King call for Gong-gil? Who knows? What's taking so long? Never look at his face. Do not ask any questions. And before you answer, always say... If it pleases Your Majesty... And if he praises you, say, By Your Majesty's grace. Let's play. If it pleases Your Majesty... Sir? I said, let's have some fun. If it graces by Your Majesty... That bastard of a minister spoiled the fun, didn't he. So, just you and me, let's play. Gong-gil's back! Gong-gil! Come here. What did the King want? What did you do? We played with puppets. - Puppets? - He enjoyed it. And that's all? He poured me some wine. He did? And what else? Come to mama. Poor baby's hungry. Baby wants mama's milk. Come on. Don't want milk? Then some wine, baby? Did you all view Yun's fingers? Don't tell me you really did! Your Majesty, for every crime there is a fitting punishment. No doubt Yun deserves to be punished for corruption. But allowing the minstrels to mock the dignity of ministers... Will only undermine the authority of the government. They're jesters, so they jest. But if Your Majesty continues to dance to their tune... Their tune? It is you who would seek to call the tune! You speak only to nag me about the damn law! Dismiss this nagging fool immediately! Your Majesty, given his loyalty to the previous King... Surely he deserves some mercy. Loyal to my father? Yes, but then why not to me as well? The previous King was like a wise father to the people. Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Sully my sight nevermore! That's all you say the late king, the late king. Why didn't you just follow him to his grave? Is a king that killed his own mother a good king? Sire... His Majesty! You play too! Go on! Do it! Gong-gil! Where is my Gong-gil? Sit over there. But, Your Majesty... I insist. Sit. Now look at this. Father, I long to see mother! Did I not tell thee to forget her? Sir, I beg of thee, just this once... Weak in will, thou art fit to become but a changeling! Father! I beg thee! And follow this book for whose pleasure? You serve the King, do you not? But why does the King call for Gong-gil so often? His Majesty calls whom he pleases. It concerns you not. We're leaving this place. Cheo-seon wants us to do this. Shit, what are we now, puppets? We should have left sooner. Fine, so we'll leave. But... After we do this. I really want to. We cannot do this anywhere else. There's the King's grandmother. And the previous King's consorts. Really! Let's get ready. Pay attention and stick to your parts. Yeah, yeah. Just this once, then we leave. If tonight the King... Should call me to his bed... 'Tis already the 300th night... Of my forlorn loneliness. Ouch! My Lord, this night... Let me serve thee. Another night, another nought. Passion swells. So I kept this awl pressed to my arm. Her Majesty! This is most unfair! You fools! Whisper, whisper. She this, she that. Stop mumbling and speak! Surely that is not us that those jesters mock? They would not dare with the Queen mum watching. Oh, Mother! No! Desist! I beg thee. Must you demand the death of the woman I love? Infinite is her deviousness. She has my son's soul bewitched. Drink this bitter potion. Unbounded is the King's love... But many are those who want it. He giveth me this black liquid of love, how can I refuse? My son. Dwell long in the sweetness of life... And bury me by the road the King travels on. My son! Mother! Have mercy, Your Majesty! What is all this? My mother they murdered! Art thou blind? Nonsense! She was a woman of treachery and... Silence! Do not kill my mother twice! No! Mercy! Mercy! Your Majesty. Enough! Touch me not! No! King's next target is us. We can't just sit around to die. Then we should stop this ridiculous circus. Don't you get it? The king knows everything. Do you think we stayed alive because the king didn't know? It's different from the king knowing and the truth out in public. We have to stop this circus from getting out into the world. How in the world can we stop it? We have to give them. Who should I torture this time? Just give me the name. Sit down. I just don't want to be a part of this motley show anymore. I just want to take my men and get out of here. What the hell is going on? Every time we do a show, people end up dead! Thanks to that loose cannon of a King! Gong-gil! Have you heard anything? Pack your things. Eh? - We're leaving this place. - Leave? I told the old man we're leaving. Allow me to leave, Your Majesty. Take this, although compared to what you've given me, it is nothing. Your Majesty! Grant me to leave this place. Very nice! An official's robe just so becomes you. The silk looks stunning with your fair skin! But still, for all the hard work he did exposing all your enemies... A rather shabby gift, isn't it? Leave us. What if he's really a girl? His voice, his gestures... Not even eunuchs can have the same finesse. Enough! Are you not curious? Let's strip him. Go on! Be a man and show it to me! Enough, I say! A little shy, are we? Then we will all strip. How's that? You vile clown! You just wait! My Lady! Please! You filthy clown! Let go! How dare you? Let go! How could you do this to me! - Open this door! - Let go! Let me go. You never had any intention of ever leaving, did you? That's not true. So what's this then? Might as well fuck the richest guy in town, is that it? Don't talk to me that way. Hear this. I have conferred a rank upon Gong-gil. Arrange a celebration in his honor. We are still in mourning over the deceased Queen, Your Majesty. But I have conferred a rank. So a celebration is in order, is it not? Perhaps a hunt could please Your Majesty. Party 'No', but hunting 'Yes'? Not to kill, but only for the pleasure of the chase. First it's eunuchs, then servant girls, and now this! What's with the chicken mask? Gong-gil's been what? Entitled? And so we must wear these ridiculous things? Shut up! Just do as you're told. Aye, aye. Okay, we're on. Everybody disperse, quickly! - Where to? - That way. Which way? Which way? Where is the Captain? I don't know. - And Gong-gil? - No idea. This is bullshit! It's Gong-gil! Gong-gil! Over here! Gong-gil, where's the Captain? Man, this sucks. What's this? Run! Gong-gil! Gong-gil is in danger! Come on! Let's go! Shoot! Shoot! Gong-gil! Oh, no! So, I see. We're not hunting quails, are we? By selfless sacrifice, ministers have built this kingdom. Yet you invite gutter rats to mock us? When my father sentenced my mother to death... You were the one who delivered the poison! Her blood is on your hands! Heaven has seen the evils of your tyranny. And will punish you for it. We should have left... When we had the chance! - Six Dix! Don't go! - No! No! Sire. The king killed the first and the second prime minister. We have to hurry. Six Dix! Napisy pobrane z NapisZone Come back! By selfless sacrifice, ministers have built this kingdom. Yet you invite gutter rats to mock us? Now it's your turn. Take this. Take it. Now, shoot me! No, shoot her instead. Here is a wench who stops at no evil! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, I say! Heaven has seen the evils of your tyranny. My Lady, here is the flyer, written by Gong-gil's hand. Read it out loud! In depravity upon depravity, the King... What's this about? They say these flyers are pasted all over Seoul! Then this was written by? You numbskull! Now you see why I wanted a copy of this? Want to know who wrote this? Look at it. Haven't you heard? There are flyers up criticizing the King. And not just the King either. We're mentioned too, and not in a nice way! We too could end up dead. Let's go. Don't go. Let's go, Captain! No! Don't go! You've gone mad! No! No! No! - Let go! - Don't go! Let go of me! - Stop it! Stop it! - Let go! Write this. In depravity upon depravity, the King... My Lady! Keep writing! In depravity upon depravity, the King... Keep writing, I say! With dancing girls on his lap, and clowns by his side... The King indulges in the most vulgar... It's identical! Arrest him! Your Majesty, I know nothing about this. My Lord! But why? You have the wrong man. I wrote it. He's innocent. The audacity of it has my signature all over it. After all, it was by audacity that I got in the palace. You're making this up! Well, well. A whore and her tongue's work is never done. How dare you! Look closely. He's lying! Why would he confess so readily? He learned to write from me. He imitated my style. That's why it looks the same. But he has no guts to write such a thing. These words are mine. He is the King's beloved. Why would he do such a thing? As soon as day breaks... Behead him. In bringing the minstrels into the palace... I wanted them to show Your Majesty... The corruption plaguing your court. And? But in your lust for a boy, you've become... Do you wish to die? Perhaps your time has come. Death, I do not fear. But to see the previous King... Get out! And appear never again! My Lord! Spare him! Spare him! My Lord! Spare him! I beg you! You're free to go. Your work is done. That's not by a Royal order, is it? Forget Gong-gil. From up here, even the palace looks no better than a hovel! In a world full of scoundrels, only here... Did I meet the nastiest of them all. Ho! And the foul things he would do! Will you hear this tale then? As the gods kill us for their sport, so would he. He killed more souls than... There are tiles on these roofs. His lust insatiable... Even 2,000 virgins were not enough. Why, his pecker was this big. No, this big! With it he skewered clam after virgin clam. And when he got tired of girls... He wasted no time mounting a boy. Whoever pleased his one-eyed snake... Was given delicacies and silk robes. And a title to boot! My Lord! My Lord! Please, no! My Lord! Spare him! No! Your Majesty! Pollute not thy hands with the blood of the vulgar! Well said. You do it then. Kill me instead. Kill me! I've nothing more to lose, so strike! Nothing to lose? Hear my command! Sear his eyes with iron! No, no, no, no, no, no! The date has been fixed. You have served 3 Kings. Join us in serving the 4th King. It is not men... But Heaven that mandates Kings. Then let us obey the Will of Heaven. Has Heaven not abandoned this King? How could I know... What Heaven wills? So whose idea was it to take in the minstrels? Bringing in some clowns hardly requires an idea. Jesters jest. We laugh, and then it's over. Hey you! Shall I tell you a story? When I worked as a servant in my youth... One day, the madam's ring went missing. The master was furious with us servants. But everybody kept mum. It was unbearably cold that day. So I said, "I did it". So where's the ring? He says. So I said, "I swallowed it". Right then, a club comes a-flying. And whacks me right in the mouth! Man, did it sting! Like it was on fire. Just like my eyes right now. Had I been hit in my eye instead... Maybe my mouth would suffer today? All my life, I played at being blind. Now that I'm really blind, I'll never get to play it again. And I was just getting good at it too. - I'm so sorry. - For what? I was the one who stole the ring. Let's run away together! Don't look down! I'm scared! All around the rope is an abyss. Neither land nor sky, but an abyss. All my life, I played at being blind. Now that I am really blind, it's a shame I'll never get to play one. And I was just getting good at it too. Why? Why? Bastard! Arrange a party, Cheo-seon. Cheo-seon! Cheo-seon! Being blind, I thought I'd never walk the rope again. But this is something else! Truth be told, I have a knack for going blind. Listen to this story. After I saw my first show, I was blind to everything else. What a high that was... strutting on the stage, rapping with a partner. I could see nothing else! When I came to Seoul, the glitter of money blinded me. Then I came here... to the palace... And being blind, I saw nothing. Didn't see the murderous thief stealing a heart. Well that's that. Anyway, I see nothing but an abyss now. How sublime! I should have gone blind sooner! You damn fool! Is it really so good to be blind! Yeah, it is! I love it, I really do! My, my, there's a fool, rash and proud! A sightless fool who knows not where he stands! Get down this instant! Ho! A tongue most untamed! I am the King of this palace, you wench! Indeed you are! I've always wanted to see my King. And now I've seen thee, I see! What? What do you see? Thou art blind to what's high and what's low. So thou hast turned this world upside down. My Lady! My Lady! What body shall thy reborn soul take? A nobleman's? No, no. A King's, then? That displeases also. I wish to be a minstrel again. Witless fool! Why seek again thy cause for ruin? Then what new body awaits thee? It is none other! A minstrel! And nothing more! The world's but a stage! Kingly is he who struts for a while, then exits in style! Then together again, we shall royally this blessed earth roam! Hee haw! Hey, hey! Am I here and you there? No, I'm here and you're there. Oh, I'm there and you're here. We're all here! And there is neither you nor me. Hi ho!
