Hey, let's have a drink. We're free like a paloma! - No, thanks. - Hey, man, don't be a chicken. Hey, Buck, you saved my life, man. I'm not gonna let you get away that easy. Huh? You don't owe me nothing. Hey, that ain't how it is, Buck. Buck! Tell you what. At least let me give you a ride home. What do you say to that, huh? I won't even speak Spanish, Buck. To you. Have a cup of champagne, talk some business... What do you say, Buck? Okay. All right! All right! That's the way I like it. That's my man. Here you go. Want some? No, it gives me a headache. What headache, man? We're free! What are you talkin' about? - Hi there! - Hey, yeah! Your town's a piece of shit, man. Look at this. You gotta come with me to Miami. I'll make you rich. Hey. Legitimate, I swear. My family got lots of legitimate business, man. I'm sure they do. Thanks. But, uh, no, thanks.

Thanks for the ride. Shit, Buck! You're gonna drive me nuts! Hello, Roscoe. Would you tell the sheriff I'm here? Okay. Come in. Sit down, Buck. I'll just stand here. Sit down. Well, I'll be reaI honest with you, Matthews. You know, you should've asked that parole officer of yours to parole you to another town where the law enforcement doesn't know you as well as I do. See, I don't want you in this town. You're an ex-convict and you're a killer. And as far as I'm concerned, you're one mean son of a bitch who shouldn't be out on the streets. I guess that's all. No, that's not all. You report here once a week. And if you so much as fart... and I get wind of it... Get out. Get out. That's all. Hey, Buck. Hey, J.B. Good to see you. Miami, man. Who's that? He's a friend of mine. He drove me here. - You feeI rehabilitated? - Yeah. Yeah, I thought so. Thinking about moving? - No. - Why not? Hell, I grew up here. It's home. You feeI like moving? After the screwing you got, I don't know why you wanna come back here in the first place. You don't? I don't need any more problems, know what I mean? The sheriff is gonna make your life miserable. The man's an asshole. - He's your boss, J.B. - Just for ten more days. Say, what's this? Thanks. This town is losing its greatest black man. I'm retiring. I'm gonna lay on the beach, work on my tan. Mommy, Mommy, Daddy's home! He's home! What's in the letter? Oh, it said, "Anytime, anyplace, anything. " Oh? What's her name? No, no, it's nothing like that. - Daddy! Daddy! - Thanks for the ride. Hey! Come here! Oh, Daddy, you're home! K ss K ss I missed you so much. Well, I missed you. I missed you. Here, take this. That's for you. See what you can do with that. Hello. Hi. It's been kinda hard on you, hasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. But it won't be anymore. Daddy, thank you so much. Mommy, Mommy, look what Daddy got me. Oh, honey, that's beautifuI. It's just almost as beautifuI as you. It's nice to know some things don't change. Is Jen as good as she seems? Yeah, she is, though she's been on pins and needles since we visited you last, trying to believe you were really coming home. - Yeah. - But, uh, I think she's great. I don't think she's one of our problems. Good. How about the job? It's there. You start tomorrow night. Tomorrow night. That's good. - Are you sure? - What? I just don't think it's fair that they're making you start all over again. Well, they have to. Oh, damn it! They're just af... they're just afraid that someone won't like an ex-con being foreman. Seems like everybody in this town is afraid of somebody or something. I think it would be better if we just got out of here. No, Christie. No. Why stay if they're not gonna treat you right? Hey, what about all that we said we're gonna do? Our plans, our plans about getting ahead... Aren't you guys ever gonna finish talking? Maybe, maybe not. Come here. Come over here. Get over here. - Has mama tickled you? - Yes. It's not much, but I need it. It's home. You glad to have me home? Huh? Are you glad to have me home? I'll just come by the house, Hank. Hey, there he is! Hey! How you doing, boss? I'm not the boss anymore. How you doing? Good. Hell, it's just a temporary thing. You'll be foreman before they get this thing skinned. We'll see. Company don't know what the hell they're doing. They never did, did they? Is there anything to know? Just don't get too bored, is all. I won't. I'm good at that. - Okay, buddy. - See you later. - Good luck to you. - What do you say, Buck? Tommy, you wanna go for a couple cold ones? Good luck, Buck! - Hi, Jake. - Another hard day? Actually, it wasn't too bad. - Good night. - Good night. No! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! No! Hold her down. - Hold her down! - No! Hold her, for chrissakes! No! No! You're okay. You're okay now. I'm gonna take you to the hospitaI. You're okay. It's my job to enforce the law in this town, and I do it. I have a mind to send you back right now for that stupid vigilante shit. But you're gonna leave this town, Matthews, and I mean leave it. One way or the other, I'll see to that. No shit. Don't play with me, boy. You can only lose. - Where you going, boy? - Back to work, sir. - Back to work? - Yes, sir. "Yes, sir. " I like that. "Sir. " Hey! Buck! Hey, what are you doing here? What the hell is going on? Hi, Mr. Matthews. Will you talk to us? Were you frightened? Do you know who these assailants were? - How've you been? - Good. No, I don't. I'd like to know. - You didn't call me. - There wasn't time. When did you get out of prison? Did you know nurse Reynolds before last night? Please talk to us, Mr. Matthews. You used to call me "Buck," Melody. Remember? - They gonna give you your job back now. - Think so? A reluctant hero, a good Samaritan... a speciaI breed in these violent, frightening times. This is Melody Mendrosa with mini-cam 6 In front of Buck Matthews' house on East Canyon Road. Everyone knows they're drug runners. They used to stay out of town, but about a year and a half ago, people started seeing more and more of them. Now they just do whatever they wanna do. What about the sheriff? Oh, a lot of noise. He doesn't do anything. Thanks. J.B.? Yeah, he arrested a few of them, but when they but out on baiI, they just disappear. Yeah. Oh, God. - You tired? - Yes. How tired? I'm not that tired. Hello? Hey, what are you doing here? Gave the hero the night off, huh? ReaI nice of 'em, huh? - Yeah. You want a cold one? - Sure. Don't mind if I do. You know, nobody ever stood up to them before. They are gonna take it personaI. You think so? Yeah, they're gonna try and pop you on the job when you're alone one night... And then you're gonna get pissed off, then the sheriff is gonna get pissed off, and all that means is a hassle for me. So I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor... ...since you're not gonna leave this town. Ease up on 'em a little bit... ...untiI I can. Thanks for the warning. Thanks for the beer. Hi. - Hey. Now how do you feeI? - Mm, fine. Jen asleep? No, she's doing her homework. Did I hear the telephone? That was J.B. He just dropped by. What did he want? Buck? This gun is dirty. Honey? You know, sometimes when I was prison, I'd get a feeling... ...reaI quiet and deep. You know, just before something bad would happen. Same thing in Vietnam. And you have it? Yeah. Now? Yeah. Listen, Jen and I don't need this. We don't need it. You're the one who wants to stay here, not me. Yeah. Buck, please. Please, please. Okay. Get Jen and let's pack some things. You mean it? Yeah.

What for, then? I'm praying for vengeance. Hello, operator? I'd like to make a collect call to area code 3-0-5... My name is Buck Matthews. Hello, Jamie? Yeah. Yeah, it's me. I'm really hurtin' and I need a little help. I'm not too heavy for you, am I? No, not at all. Though I can't tell you how gratefuI I am for what you did. That's okay. Okay. Okay, Hank, this is picture. Let's do it now. Easy now. That's nice. - Thanks again. - You're welcome. You in? Yeah. You take care of yourself. And so Buck Matthews, A man who has lost so much. goes home... Roscoe! ...and makes us wonder about the quality of our local law enforcement. Let's go back to the beginning. Let's go back to the night of August... Shit. LocaI law enforcement. I'll show her law enforcement. Since almighty God has called our sister Christie from this life to Himself, we commit her body to the earth from which it was made. Christ was the first to rise from the dead, and we know that He will raise up our mortaI bodies to be like his in glory. We commend our sister to the Lord. May the Lord receive her into His peace and raise up her body un... Let us pray for our sister to our Lord Jesus Christ, who said, "I am the resurrection and the life. "The man who believes in me will live even if he dies, "and every living person who puts his faith in me will never suffer eternaI death. " Lord, You wept at the death of Lazarus, Your friend. Comfort us in our sorrow. We ask this in faith. They're all over the place like ants in the manufacturing business. That cheap stuff... crack... shipping it all over America. Lots of money. Big Bucks. They got a place somewhere out there in the desert. They do just about anything they wanna do. There was a time we could've stopped them, but, uh... but the sheriff didn't want to. What about you? What about me? Hey, where do you go to surrender? I'm almost out of here, man. That's all I wanted. - Boy, I remember a time when you'd... - That time is past, Buck. I just don't care anymore. Look, I did my time. It took me 20 years to make, uh, sergeant, and I had to come to this hick town to do it. It would've taken any shit-head peckerwood two years. Look, I don't owe anybody nothing... But I know why that badass sheriff hates you. He's afraid of you. You come back from overseas... with medals. Everybody admires you. You're a man that was ready to challenge him and get those people in the town to stand up to him, and he knew that, so, uh... He did something about it. He stopped you. You... and me. Now all I want is out. I tell you one thing, though. You go out there after them... you're going alone. So I go alone. You can't stay here. I'm not leaving. Look, I got a... an extra room in my place. You're welcome to it. Come right over there right now. No, I'm gonna stay. Jesus. Look, I'll be around somewhere if you need me, all right? You broke the rules. I make the rules. Then we're all gonna go down the shitter unless you keep these animals out of this town. That's the deaI. We're in trouble as it is with that idiot brother of yours raping that girI. I take care of Ray. All right, all right. Take it easy, take... You guys are nutty, that's all. Showing up at the funeraI... You take care of your business, and I take care of mine. - Fine. - You bet. Fine. Hello! Hello! Hello! Yeah? Oh, take it easy. Take it easy. How you was been? Tengo un surprise for you. Yeah, surprise. Jamie. Okay, let's go. Bring it on down. Okay, hold it. Hold it. Hey, Jorge, show him the console, man. You gonna love it, man. Huh? You like? Yeah, it's reaI nice. What's in that box? What do you think, huh? It's another supply. You know, you have a very good friend. Go on. Hi, baby. It's daddy. Her vitaI signs are good. I think she's gonna pull out of it. Good. Straight. Father Healey brought that. Oh. Well, thank him for me. I will. Daddy got something for you, sweetheart. Here, I can open it. I'll open it for you. Look at that. Look at that. It's just like the other one. It's gonna be all right, Jennifer. I promise, for you, it's gonna be all right. Seen some maggots on Pass Road. They might be headed out toward the Matthew place. Where you going, Ed? Sheriff wants ribs. Hold down the fort. Damn it! Oh, Ray. Jesus, Ray. It couldn't have been nobody but you. You're still not gonna say nothing, huh? Prove it. Prove it?! You still have to prove it. Do I?! You doing that time inside there didn't do anything for you, did it? You were an asshole then, and you're a bigger asshole now. But you are fucking up. And the next time you go away, you're going away for a long time. Now get him the fuck outta here! Get him now! Come on. Goddamn you. J.B., don't you push me! - Get off him. - Hey! What are you looking at, black man? I'm looking at a white man. That's right, a reaI white man. Take a good look. Now, get him outta here, boy. Come on, you get outta here, too. Go on, get! Oh, shit. I'm sorry, Christie. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Oh, goddamn. - Howdy, Buck. - Hello, Roscoe. I'm sure sorry about Christie. They're just playing with you, you know. Soon enough, they're gonna kill ya. You ever stop to think if you hadn't come back here, none of this would've happened? If you hadn't gone into Rosales' bar, maybe you wouldn't have gone to state prison. It was self-defense. No, you don't get the slammer for self-defense. Well, you were there. You saw what happened. But it don't matter now, does it? Buck, that shotgun's a parole violation. Well, come on and take me in. Take me in! You don't know, do you, kid? You're already dead. Do me a favor, huh? Get outta this town. Let these maggots have it. I'll fix up this plane, and I'll fly you the hell outta here myself. I'm not running. Well, I am in a few more days. Get outta here before they find out where you are and blow up my Stearman. UntiI Jen is strong enough to traveI, I'd like to have a guard on her. Is there anybody you can trust? No. Hey... I'll see what I can do, okay? Okay, thanks. You're gonna be able to go home in a few days, okay? And while I'm not here, Jimmy here is gonna stay and take care of you. He's a reaI nice guy, and he loves paper dolls. Don't you? Oh, yeah. You bet. They're my favorite. Yeah, okay. - Daddy? - What? Do I have to go home? I'm scared. We'll work something out. Take care now. I just got your... Shh. She's trying to go to sleep. Come on out in the hall. Night, honey. This is Charlie Henderson, my man. He's gonna watch things for us. - Good. - This is Buck. - How you doing, Buck? - Thanks a lot. - Where you going? - You got some change? Yeah, I think. What... what do you want it for? I'm gonna call the county D.A. Yeah, well, what does me being on probation have to do with anything? Look, I served my time. Now I'm in trouble and I need help. No, my parole officer is the sheriff. He's the frigging problem. That's what I've been trying to tell you! No, you're not listening to me! Look, these people killed my wife, and nobody's doing a thing about it. And my daughter's in the... Yes, there were witnesses. What about me, for chrissake? - Damn it. - Where you going? I'm gonna go get a witness. I suppose you need my help. I suppose you want me to blow my pension just to save your white ass! - Hey, Matthews! - Come on, J.B. Nice to see you. Thanks for comin' in. Buckle up. - What's going on? - Run! Get outta here! Come on. Inside, quickly! He's alive, God damn it! Goddamn! Hang on! - Fucking great. - Damn it. You drive! Come on, let's go! Come on! Come on! Get us outta here! Come on! I'll put this truck right up his ass. Come on, Buck! Now. He's still alive. Unfortunately, he can't speak. Oh, shit. - Somebody caved in his larynx. - Damn it! Perhaps the boy can write. You know, I don't think he likes you very much. Why don't you let me handle it from here? Go on. Let me handle it from here. Buck. Look, I tried. Maybe the boy will talk, but they're gonna retaliate! You gotta forget about vengeance now and protect yourself! How, Father? I-27. I got it! I-30. N-35! Excuse me a minute. What in God's sake is wrong with you people? Don't you know what's going on out there, or are you just pretending not to see it? I can't believe this. This place is crawling with lice, and you're acting like it's Mayberry R.F.D. You know, when I went off to Vietnam to fight, I wasn't fighting for patriotism or some flag or some country. I was fighting for this town so I could come back and marry Christie... ...have kids and raise a family, have a normaI life. You know, it don't matter how we wish things were. It matters how we deaI with how they are. Now, you gave Sheriff Copeland this town. You gave it to him. He's got it. He ain't gonna give it back. It's as simple as that. And I'll tell you what. The next person that dies might be your wife or your kid. So I wanna know... who is gonna help me? God. O-64. - Thanks, Jimmy. - Hey, man. I appreciate it. - Be back tonight, okay? - Oh, yeah. I'll be here. Okay. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. I just wanna say about the... Jennifer's gonna be okay. I was... Don't worry about it. Really. It's my job. Well... do you need a ride home? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do need one. - Okay, good. Let's go. - Great. It always makes me shiver. I hope nothing's wrong. Yeah. Can I buy you a beer? No, thanks. Not tonight. Come on. I think it'd do you good. Okay. Great. I'm afraid I'm not very good company. Don't worry. I grew up with these people. Thought I knew 'em. I can't believe they live this way. They're afraid, Buck. So am I. I don't know if you know... ...but I just spent some time in prison... ...and you have a lot of time to think. And what I thought about most was what I had had. I thought about what I had after I lost it. You really don't know what you have untiI it's taken away. I'm sorry. It's okay. Well, how are you doing? I'm doing fine. Good. Well, I mean, nothing will be the same or anything... But I'm fine. Well, that's good. Come here. Turn around. Come on. Where'd you learn this? I'm a nurse, remember? Feels good. Yeah? Yeah. They've got Jennifer. God. Not even a child, a helpless child, is safe in this hospitaI in this damn town! Why are you persecuting that boy? You put him in prison for no reason. You know it, I know it, the town knows it. - Does God know it? - Look, don't mention God to me. Take it easy, okay? Your people took my daughter. I wanna know where. Okay. That's twenty-five seconds. You got 20 seconds now. Here you go. You better write it fast. Fine. Son of a bitch. Matthews. You've done it now, boy. Hold it right there. You're under arrest. I said hold it!
