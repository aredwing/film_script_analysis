Whoever said it, though... forgot to mention if that part ever comes back. ( SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( AUDIENCE APPLAUDS ) ANNOUNCER (OVER PA): We're now left with our two finalists... the first of which is Marzo Bolivar riding El Diablo. A misstep. ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( AUDIENCE APPLAUDS ) Come on, babe. ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.): And now, four-time consecutive champ... Cal Masterson riding Fandango. ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.): And this year's winner is, for a fifth consecutive time... Cal Masterson and Fandango. ( MUSIC FADES DOWN ) Hey. Oh, hey. Sorry, I was, uh, I was just thinking. About what? Where you're gonna put your next trophy? No. I was actually thinking about retiring. Serious? Yeah. I'm gonna be 45 before the next Cup. I got five titles in a row. I was thinking now might be a good time to cash it in. On the other hand, a final competition, me and Fandango, six? No horse in the world's ever won six. Well, I think six would be a mighty fine retirement record, Cal. We'll keep you around for the day-to-day stuff, though. Maybe a little raise in there, too? I don't want to get too crazy. I'll be done in about ten minutes. Let's grab a hotdog on the way out. Yeah. Why don't you go grab it now? I'll finish up here. Yeah, take Maggie with you. I don't want you getting stuck at the concession stand yappin' to some little filly all day. Me? You want anything else? Nah, I'll be all right. Okay. Will you help me walk in this mud? MAN (O.S.): Hey. Oh, no. Oh, no. Look out! Hey! Look out! ( STOMPING ) FEMALE (OVER P.A.): Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Good. Doing a lot better. You really had us worried there for the first few days. How you feeling? Like I've been in an accident. Good. Good? I, uh, hear you do some work with, uh, horses. I ride a five-time world champ Paso Fino. Going for six this year. Not anymore, I'm afraid. Now that hand will heal, but the real damage is in your leg. That won't. Not for the strain of riding anymore. What're you saying? I'm telling you that you're a very lucky man. You're alive. I'm gonna be back in a little while, and... try and get some rest. FEMALE (OVER P.A.): Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Fandango? He's fine. No, don't try to get out. Honey, it's gonna be okay. You can still have the stud farm. I still have you. I know. Life has a funny way. Look, you heard the doctor. You're lucky. I come close. That's the closest I ever been. Makes you think. What do you mean? No. I... I'm just saying stuff. Why don't you just sleep for a while? ( GROANS ) ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) FEMALE (OVER P.A.): Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Dr. Davis, telephone, please. They're trying to close the lid on my coffin before I've even had a chance. Listen to this. "Renowned trainer and rider, Cal Masterson... who was hospitalized after a debilitating accident several weeks ago, has retired. Doctors have confirmed that he will not be able to ride... for a possible sixth victory in next year's Paso Fino World Cup." What's that writer's name? Garret Jobody. Well, I hope he gets hit by a Mack truck. Cal! What? Have you read this garbage? No... and for good reason. I tell you, somebody's dancing a jig right now. ( OPERA MUSIC FADES UP ) It's good news, no? Why you wish ill will to people? It's a bad habit. Get out of it. So, he's your rival? So, what? Maybe he's half dead now. Show a little respect. I think it's terrible what happened. It's tragic. Should we send something? We'll send flowers. Yeah. Lily's. Anyone know about the horses? He's fine. Aren't you supposed to be at a piano lesson or something? Um, I canceled. Papa, I thought maybe I could work with the horses a little bit more. Well, you had the whole morning to do that, Lily. I don't know. All my life, I tried to create options. That's all I wanted... options, for both of you. That's all. You play the piano. You go to China. It's immaterial to me. Lily, take the time now. Just improve yourself a little. That's all. As a lady would do. Yeah. Come on, Lily. You know any real handlers out there? You should thank me for taking care of the horses you get to ride. Papa. Papa, you know I am better than anyone with these horses. You know, I try to choose what's best for both of you. If I fail, I fail. So be it. You're not a stable boy. I give you your time. These horses eat while I sleep. You eat while I sleep. You make an agreement with me, just stick to it. That's all I ask. Okay. I can move on with my life. I can. She's as stubborn as a horse. Show disrespect to her again. Come on! In front of me. Could you do what she did on a horse? She was half your age. Hey. And send the flowers. Okay. Okay, come on, honey. You're a stubborn old man. I ain't old yet. The truck's pulled up. Look at you. You look like Mad Max. Yeah. All right. Come on, let's get you out of here. No, the last I saw, they were right behind us. Yeah. I'm here right now. Okay. Okay, well, I'll see you in five. Sorry, honey, we're a little off track. What? I said, "We're a little off track." I'm sorry. I'm not in a rush to get there. Oh, come on, sweetheart. This'll be good for us, I promise. ( WHINNIES) ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Look at that. Looks like that old Murphy ranch finally sold. Yeah. Bet the new owners want me to fix that property line fence. Okay. Let's saddle up Fandango. Now you're getting ahead of yourself, there, Cal. He ain't gonna let me ride him yet. Ah, just gonna walk him around a few laps. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Howdy, Miss. Oh, that's all right. Come on, you can have a gander. This here's, uh, Fandango. Fandango. I guess that makes me your new neighbor. I'm Cal Masterson. You're the Cal Masterson? Well... Five World Cup wins. I'm Claire. So nice to meet you. You, too. How's your leg? Oh, it's, uh, it's fine. I'm healing up real good. You know a thing or two about horses, do you? Oh, yeah. Everything. Top of the head is the pole... and the crest behind that down to the withers is the croup. And the hindquarters down to the gaskin is the hock. Well, I guess you do know a thing or two about 'em. You do some riding? Never ridden before. Well, wait a minute. You... you love horses, but you've never ridden? There's something wrong with that. You know, you ought to come over here sometime. We'll tr... I hope Claire isn't trying to tell you how to keep your horses. Uh, no, no. She... she's got her head screwed on pretty straight. Mason Scott... I'm your new neighbor. I'm, uh, Cal Masterson. You ranching over there? No, I'm a developer. Retired. Semi-retired. I still dabble here and there. Yeah. I see you've been, uh, dabbling around here. Yeah. There are some good opportunities. It's beautiful country. Yes, it is. Claire's mad about horses. It's why we bought the Murphy place. You bought this place to be close to your work. Well, that, too. Hmm. Oh, hey. Hey, honey. Hi. Guys, I would, uh, like you to meet my wife, Maggie. Hi. Hi, Maggie. New neighbors. Mason. This is my daughter Claire. Nice to meet you. Hi. Hello. Aren't you a living doll? Just beautiful. You take after your mother, I bet. Yes, she does. Well, welcome. You all should join us for lunch. Okay. Can we do it in two hours? We got some work to do. Sure. Uh... Yeah, that'd be fine. Okay, can we bring something? No, we've got plenty. Hey, you. Yeah. All right. Come on, honey. Let's go. We got some work to do. See you in two. Okay, great. All right. Come on, honey. They seem nice. I guess. But did you have to do that? Do what? Invite 'em for lunch. Two hours? Come on. We eat around 12:30. By 2:30, I'm starving. You're a grown man. You can handle it. Didn't you see the poor thing? No, what? She's lost her mother. Oh. ( MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) Slow down. I'm just hungry. Hey, uh, sorry I'm late. This is our hand, Tucker. Mason. Hey, Mason. Pleasure to meet you. Did you wash up? Yes, ma'am. I did. I'm not 13 anymore. I am. You're what? I'm 13. Well, hello, 13. My name's Tucker. Nice to meet you. So, what do we got? Help yourself. Yes, ma'am. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) You're doing a great job with Claire. She's a neat kid. Thanks. That has gotta be hard being a single parent. Her mom died of cancer six months ago. Oh... I'm sorry. What was her name? Katherine. It was quick. It has been rough. Well, Claire seems like a tough girl. Yeah. Her and her mother were really close. I'd go to work, and Katherine would stay home with Claire. But we're getting to know each other pretty well now. It's coming together. Katherine loved horses. She became obsessed with them. It's easy to do. Well, Claire's taken it on. I guess... it keeps her mom in her memory, it's how she keeps going. What about you? Me? I work. Your husband, he's good with kids. Fortunate, 'cause he's not so good with adults. We've been trying to have our own family for some time, but... You should keep trying. It's worth it. Here you go. Go on. He likes you. Yeah. Hm? You got a good touch. Seems like you guys are old friends already. You know, when he gets back to being his regular self... maybe you can come by, take him to ride. I guess. I've just always been scared to. You know? Yes, I do. You know, I didn't start riding 'til I was 15... but I haven't done anything else with my life since. I know what it's like to be scared... but I can tell that you love these animals... just like I did... like I still do. You know what? I'll help you. Go on. It's good for the soul. Trust me. Thank you. Honey? It's time to go. See you at home. Thanks for lunch. And, uh, thanks for being so good with my daughter. Oh, it's my pleasure, really. She's, uh, she's always welcome here. So are you. I don't usually get to see her this happy. Sorry. "Sorry"? Why? Eh, I kind of stole your moment there. No. No, you... Listen, uh, if there's anything's that I can do for you, you just... you just ask me. Okay. Closed? Mm-hm. All right. Here's your step. Just... there you go. Closed? Really? Okay. Here we go. Open 'em. This is Filena. Oh, my gosh. You like her? She's beautiful. She's yours. Go. I thought you could take her over to the Mastersons. Cal can teach you how to saddle her up, and ride and... giddy up, and all that sort of stuff. What? Oh, come on, honey. It's what she wanted. She wanted you to ride. ( PHONE RINGS ) One minute. Yeah? MAN (ON PHONE): Hey, there's a problem with the contract. What do you mean, "There's a problem with the contract"? Wait, d... MALE (ON PHONE): The fees weren't included in the deal. The fees were included in the... Claire? No. We agreed on that. Yes. ( HUMMING ) Well, hello, there. Hi. Who are you? Oh, I come out and help take care of the horses for Cal... every once in a while. I'm a Ferrier. You know what that is? You trim and balance the horses' hooves. Oh, so you know a thing or two. Yes, I do. Do you know about Paso Finos? A little. I just got one. It was a gift... from my dad. So you know about their gait. It's a very unusual gait. FERRIER (V.O.): It's a four-beat gait. It's impressive because the footfall has to be in precise unison. They can lope. They can canter. They can gallop, just like every other horse. But this is the most versatile horse in the world... because you don't bounce. The rider remains motionless in the saddle... and all of this is executed with style and pride. And when done correctly, it's... it's like music. They also remember you as their rider. And they react as though they're one with you. That's why they're special. Especially this one. Especially Fandango. MASON (O.S.): Claire! I have to go. "Claire." Is that... is that your name? Yes. Well, howdy, Miss Claire. You have a nice night. You, too. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) MAGGIE (O.S.): I didn't think the bank would close on us that soon. And the owners are asking for immediate payment. The bastards, they dumped us right after the accident. I know you don't like hearing it... but I have to bring up how much we could make studding out Fandango. I'm not doing that. Um, well, then, what else, Cal? We'll have to sell some of the horses... or, what? The land? The truck? Furniture? I mean... We'll think of something. You got something? No, not yet. Daddy! You have to do something! What is it? Cal and Maggie, they're in trouble. A bank closed on them. Foreclosed, sweetheart, foreclosed. They need money... or they're gonna have to sell their horses. Well, that's terrible, but it's private business. Can't you help them? D... we just met. I don't know them. They're our neighbors. Dad, they're our friends. Oh... Claire. Okay, nosey... what did you hear exactly? Okay. Cal? Mason. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. How you doing? I'm okay. Listen, this might be a little uncomfortable... but I hear you're in a bit of a bind. Claire overheard you and Maggie talking about a loan. Listen, man, I don't want to get in your business. I just might be able to help you cover your short end is all. It was the hospital bills. We didn't see 'em coming. Well, I might be able to get you a loan. From who? Well, that's not important. I could get you covered for a year. Would that give you enough time? Yeah, it's... that'd be some time. What's it gonna cost me? Well, I am a businessman, so I have to make it worth my while. And, uh, "at my daughter's request" doesn't fully cover it. So, uh, well, being fair, and if I could pull it off... I would say, uh, maybe a stake in Fandango for the next competition? Yeah. That sounds like a good deal. Okay, well, you leave it to me. This is what I do best. Let Tucker do that. Alejandro, it's Mason Scott. ALEJANDRO (ON PHONE): Hey, Mason, how are you? I'm well, thank you. ALEJANDRO (ON PHONE): There's no hiccups with Filena. No, no. She's a beautiful horse. Actually, I'm calling because I have something that you might be interested in. Oh, uh... I'm in three locations now... and the bank is one. So, shoot. This is more personal. Uh, my neighbor owns a ranch, and he's got a prize-winning horse. Cal Masterson, you know him? Cal? Yeah, I know Cal. ( MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) Okay. Whooo whooo whooo whooo Yeah Whoo whoo whoo Whoo whoo whoo whoo Hey, I got a deal in place. A position for you... to train... with Cal Masterson. With Cal Masterson? Cal, yeah. Papa, are you crazy? Come on. Giving that clown Fandango was the stupidest thing you've ever done. It was emotional, yeah. Emotional? It was stupid! Marzo, your sister almost died on the horse. But did she? You gave him the only success he's ever had when you gave him that horse. My family's success. My success! Five years in a row I have lost to that damn horse. Second place! Papa, okay. Look, everyone... everyone in this town, they rob you blind. And what do you do? You just... you just... You turn the other cheek... like they're a bunch of homeless people. That may be... so? Yeah, but what about us? But what about your family? Marzo, it's just an opportunity. What's an opportunity? For you... to take it back, the competition. You wanna take it back? Do you wanna win? You want me to spy. You could observe, can't you? I'm not asking you to do something covert. You couldn't be covert if you tried. Marzo, just study his horses. You moan all day around here. You have no position. Why not? ( TRADITIONAL ITALIAN MUSIC PLAYING ) I'm here. Show me to my quarters. ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) To me it was a slam-dunk, with his interest in the breed. No, Alejandro's only got one thing in mind. Cal, if you want, I can shut this deal down. Done. So he's your rival. Fandango was his horse. He used to own him. His daughter would ride in the young, amateur tournaments. One day she had a bad fall. It was an accident. He wanted to put the horse down. ( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING ) Is your daughter okay? Is she okay? The horse? He got spooked. Something spooked him. I'm gonna put him down. I'll take him. Such a waste. Uh, if... if you're just gonna just, you know, put him down, I'd... I'll take him. Yeah? How much you pay? I don't have a lot of money. You give me 20. I don't have that kind of money. Serious blood... Cappuccino. That alone... Look, Alejandro, I'm not a businessman. I'm not one to bargain. This isn't about me haggling with you. I just don't have that... It's okay. Doesn't matter to me. I'll put him down. I got $12,000. Okay. Make it 12. Thank you. All right, boy. It's all right. Okay, okay. Easy, bud. Whoa-ho. It's all right. He may be your rival, Cal. But rivals often share the same passion. And sometimes that's the strongest bond of all. Listen, I wouldn't worry about Marzo. Tucker can watch him. Obviously, Alejandro took this deal because he wanted to glean some training tips. He respects you. He has to. But as you know, with any loan, you're gonna have to pay something. So you're the overseer now? All right, well, you oversee one thing, cabron. He messes up once, and I mean, once... he's outta here. Loans don't work that way, Cal. They can be bought or... ( DOOR CLOSES ) Cowboys. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) No riding today, Marzo. We just train. I always dress properly. This way the horse is not confused. Come, Fandango. We train. Oh. MARZO (O.S.): Fandango. I am your master. Quart! Okay, Fandango. Quart! Okay, Fandango, quart! Okay, Fandango. Quart! Okay... hai! Who are you? I'm Claire... and you're a Bolivar. Yes. Marzo Bolivar, right? Correct. Wow... I am such a fan of your sister, Liliana. You know, she was just the greatest. I don't think there was ever a rider more disciplined and more graceful and beautiful! ( MOUTH CLICKS ) What have you done with this horse? His gait is terrible. Well, he's had some problems since the accident, but I think we... I was being rhetorical. Boy, I could kill you with my thumb. Ai! Come on. Ai! Ah! Ah! Hey, Fandango. Hey! That's not nice. You distract him. Go home! She can stay. He must listen to me. Okay. Fandango, Corto. Come on. Come on, Fandango. Come on. Ah-ha... ah-ha. See? He knows who his master is. Come on, Fandango. Fandango. Shh. Fine animals you have here. Yeah, I'm kind of partial to all of 'em. Why haven't you trained the others? 'Cause Fandango's special. Hm. It's in his blood, right? Well, it is late... and I am tired. You'll excuse me. He's an odd bird, that one. Mm. A lot of attitude and not so much skill. Come on, Fandango. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) He doesn't like you. He doesn't need to like me. He needs to respect me. And he will. Yeah? Bribing him with a carrot isn't gonna make that happen. Fandango. Soft touch would serve you well, my friend. I thought we would try a nice ride today. Well, you thought wrong. It's just a stop, Marzo. No riding. Just training. I am the trainer. I decide... No. I will decide, and you will listen. I've been training these horses since before you were born. I've never seen such a pompous ass as you are. This horse does not respect you 'cause you don't respect him. My father tries to help you. He saves your ranch, and this is how you treat his family? I don't work today. Suit yourself. CAL (O.S.): We need a new trainer. MASON (O.S.): Cal, I'm not sure that's an option. I don't care. You got me into it, you get me out. Just tell his dad. The kid's no damn good. It's only been three days. It feels like a week, a month. Well, who would you suggest? Alejandro seems to have all the good trainers. I don't know. Somebody. Anybody. Just not that arrogant peacock. I know someone. There's also the concern of cost. I'm... I'm sure a good trainer doesn't come cheap. We're talking about Fandango. They should be paying me. That's a good point. You know horses. I know finance. I know the perfect trainer. Liliana Bolivar. She was the best Paso Fino rider in her class... and she trained all her own horses. Alejandro's daughter? Yeah. You said Fandango was her horse originally. She trained him. Yeah. But she hasn't ridden since the accident. You said you needed a trainer, not a rider. Fandango needs someone he trusts. He'll remember her. Maybe Liliana will feel the same way. She's the one. I know it. Might take the sting out of firing his son. What the hell? Can't be any worse than that knucklehead. Alejandro will never go for it, though. He's been smothering her ever since the accident. Oh, well, that's my dad's specialty. He's an expert schmoozer. It's his job. My job? Yeah. Do what you do best. Get people to do things. ALEJANDRO (O.S.): Mason. MASON (O.S.): Alejandro. How are you? I'm well. How are you? Mm. Mm. This your first time here? Yes. Yeah, it is. This is marvelous. Welcome. Thank you. Jaime, some sangria, no? Oh, not for me. It's too early. Sit. So how is Cal? He's well. He... He's okay? Yeah. He, uh... He said to pass on his gratitude. I'm sure. Listen, I have to apologize for my boy, you know? He can be... Confident? No, he's arrogant. But arrogance... changed the boundaries of the world. Yes, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out. We do have an issue of a trainer. Yeah, who did you have in mind? Uh, n... no one. No one. No one. I was hoping that you could recommend someone, since you have so many. They're necessary here to me. But, uh, what's the rush? You promised me. You told me Cal would not compete. Well, he, uh, he thinks otherwise. That was required, as we discussed. Yes, I understand. And it's highly unlikely that he will. He just needs time to admit it. That's part of the agreement that he needs to remain unaware of, yes? Did you ever think to own a horse like Fandango? Well, your own daughter, I know she has a connection. Marzo told me. Be quite a prize... for her. You'll be the hero. But, look, there are stipulations here we have to abide by. Cal does not compete in this competition... in no way. And then it's okay. Fandango is yours. 'Cause he cannot afford to pay it. If he defaults on this loan, which, I'm almost certain he will... Fandango is yours. If he does compete in this competition... I'm gonna hold you in default. Your, uh, your daughter, you mentioned that she was a trainer? Yeah, she's not a professional, though. She never was. It was a difficult time. She was so young. It took me years to break her of that. But she's a Bolivar, very strong. But, then again, competition, not a place for a woman. Alejandro, you draw up the paperwork. I'll make sure Cal doesn't ride. We need to stay on point. We need a new trainer. I'll have to think about that. You have a remarkable place. I would love to have a tour. Mi casa, su casa. Jaime! Enjoy. Take a look around. Chin chin. Chin chin. Miss Bolivar? Hi. Mason Scott. Oh, hi, Mr. Scott. You're my father's business partner. That's right, we just moved in. We bought the Murphy ranch. Wow, you don't strike me as the rancher type. No. No, I'm beginning to understand that having one... and being one are two very different things. Indeed. I was actually looking for you. Were you? Yeah, I represent the Masterson ranch. I know. Well, Marzo lasted all of three days. That was pretty... pretty good for him. Well, consequently, you would know that we are looking for a new trainer. I assume you are. I hear you're an excellent trainer. Yes, I am... when I'm allowed. Uh, look, Mr. Scott, if you're enquiring about my interest, it would be impossible. Is that your decision or your father's? I'm not interested, but thank you. Listen, when I was young, I knew this very powerful businessman. He was ruthless. And like everything else in his life, he kept his son under a protective shadow. Every time that kid tried to prove himself, his father would usurp him. He was afraid to let him go. He was afraid to trust him. Well, anyway, the boy became a man, and one day he bought his father's business. It was his father's proudest moment. You have yourself a nice story, there. Will you call me? Think about it? Nice meeting you. You, too. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Miss Bolivar, welcome. We're glad you're here. Thank you. Here, let me take your bag for you. Oh... bags are over there. Mr. Masterson... it's been some time. Miss Bolivar, I'm glad you came. Please, call me Liliana. Liliana. Thank you for coming. I'm officially on vacation... so please don't mention this to my father. I say we give this a week and see how things go. We can do that. Liliana, meet my daughter, Claire. Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you. I understand you had something to do with me being here. Well, why don't you show me Fandango? Him and I are old friends. Hi. See? He remembers you. Hm. As I remember him. How's it going? Said she wanted to spend some time with him. She knows what she's doing. She treats him like you do. We've been having trouble with that. Since the accident? ( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING ) Thanks. Corto. Corto. Shh. Hold. Hold. He's tired. It's a discipline, Claire. In competition, he's gonna be judged on style and presence as much as gait. He's gotta get this right. Corto. Cor-to. Corto, Fandango. I think you're right, Claire. He's tired. Call it a day? Hi, Liliana, uh, you can sit right here. Thank you. Here's that butter. This looks lovely. Thank you, couple more are coming. Everyone, uh, this is Sierra. Hi. Hi, Sierra. Hi, Sierra. Hey. Aren't you the cutest little thing? Gee, thanks... Sierra, was it? That's right. Hm. Uh, here's to a great first day. Yeah, I'm not very poetic, but, uh, here's to Mason... who really helped me out of a tight spot. Here's to a friend. And while we're at it, I'd like to thank Claire... for helping to soften my husband's rough edges. Here, here. Where did you two meet? At a bar the other night. Ah, that's called trolling, right? If you'll excuse me, I think I need to freshen up my iced tea. Claire? Mm? Come on. Cal, I'd like to start tomorrow at sunrise, if that's okay. No more 7:00 A.M. We have time to make up. Yeah. Good. I've been thinking about what's wrong with Fandango. During the accident, he was tied to the rail, trapped. So I think he's associating the reins with entrapment. I think the sooner he's ridden, the sooner he'll get over this fear... and we can restore his confidence and discipline. I think he's lonely. I'm serious. Well, why do you think that, Claire? Well... there's been a lot of changes for him lately. He's not used to that, and he misses Cal. He likes people, he just... well... he's had some loss in his life. Maybe the accident brought it all back. Horses don't know where people go when they leave. They grieve. He just needs time. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Stepped into the unknown You and I were so close To giving it all we had Oh, how hard I did try But my youth was passing me by Now my hands are tied But I'm not mad I was young, then I feel the same age now I was fighting hard You tried to teach me What it meant to be me But I should've known that From the start It's time to step down From this pedestal And you've placed yourself apart Take your charge You're not getting Any younger Time goes faster When you're old I was young then I feel the same age now I was fighting hard You tried to teach me What it meant to be me But I should've known that From the start Claire, that's so beautiful. Thanks. Thank you. Tough day? No more than yesterday. Maybe... he's being, you know... rebellious, like a kid. It's like me and my dad. Sometimes I can be a brat... but it's not that I don't love him or anything. It's just... he can be overprotective, without a reason. Fathers and their daughters, yeah. You can't really control anybody. They have to let you. And you? When are you gonna let yourself? Do what? Ride. You know Fandango used to be my horse, right? I know. Did you know about the accident? A little. After that, I was too afraid to even handle the horses for a while. But I love them... so I couldn't be afraid too long. I was only truly happy when I was riding again. Even if it was behind my father's back. You can't stay away from what makes you happy. My mom wanted it for me... before... before she died. She wanted me to ride. Yeah. She loved them, too. And that's why I loved them. For her. Yes, for her. But for you, too. Come here. Mm. So you like what you do? Mm, it's hard work. We gotta break the horses, and, uh, train 'em... get 'em to trust you. Kind of sounds like the work you put into a lady. Now that you mention it. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) You're the best mistake That I ever made again Lord only knows The trouble you got me in What's wrong? Nothing. ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Fandango. There we go. Wasn't so bad. Okay. Fandango, are you ready? Me, neither. Well, let's ride. ( MUSIC FADES UP ) I was kind of wondering when you were gonna bring my horse back. I rode. It'll be our secret. All right, get on outta here. Go to school. I'll take care of this guy. Good boy. Ooh. He got peanut butter on my hand. Mm. He likes it. Good boy. Okay. Listen, I know this probably doesn't mean much to you. But that young lady I been seeing, Sierra? She likes football. She eats junk food. She's fluent in French. And she's 24 years old. What does that mean? Well, my point is, kiddo... I think you're one of the greatest girls I've ever met. And we both know that you're smarter than me. But you're also 13. And you're not 13 anymore. Nope. I know. I'm sorry. Hey. Thank you. Hey, this is good. He did real good today. Actually better than ever. Something changed, huh? Thank you. Well, certainly something's changed. Something happened overnight with this horse. There's no damage anymore. No nerve damage. In my opinion, this horse can compete. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Honey, the five. Hm? The five. Oh. And then the other five. Hi. Hi! I'd like to stay on, if that's okay with you, Cal. We can't afford any more than we have. That's not really an issue. Never thought I'd be saying this to a Bolivar... but welcome to the family. I'm about to fix dinner. You should join us. Oh, yeah. I'd love to. There's just one more thing I need to do. ( TELEPHONE RINGS ) Hey, Jaime! Hello? Hey, baby, where are you? You still in Cabo? Are you fishing? ( OPERA MUSIC FADES UP ) ALEJANDRO (ON PHONE): You crossed the line. You know, I'm I'm sitting here. I-I-I-I'm trying to comprehend right now what I've done. You didn't do anything. ALEJANDRO (ON PHONE): I didn't do anything! I just saved your friend's life from a bank. I win you a champion horse, my champion horse, by the way. MASON (ON PHONE): Cal's horse. What? Cal bought that horse years ago. ALEJANDRO (ON PHONE): You know, you... you people, you know, you know nothing. You know nothing. I know more than you think, Alejandro. It's still his horse. ALEJANDRO (ON PHONE): Excuse me. He was given that horse! For a tenth of what it's worth. What the hell am I here? The patron saint of lost cowboys? ALEJANDRO (ON PHONE): You know, I just gave you my collateral. What the hell you want from me? I can appreciate all that. I just don't understand what this has to do with Liliana's decision. She has a right. A right? A right to what? These people? My daughter could be in a wheelchair right now on a feeding tube. What the hell are you... You don't... plea... don't... don't... don't presume, please. MASON (ON PHONE): I am not presuming. I'm just... will you listen? Your daughter is a grown woman, and she can make her own decision. Hey! This is unacceptable, and you make it right. God. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. Just... business. You were doing so much better. That's funny. Come here. ( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING ) Listen, I'm... I'm sorry. I haven't really been there for you since Mom... I lost her, too, Dad. I know what I need to do to be a better father. I can't promise you I'll be perfect... but I can promise you, I will try. ( PHONE RINGS ) Whoever this is, you need to call back, because I'm with my daughter. There. See? That was amazing. I don't want you to worry. Cal will never lose Fandango. Why would he? Well, technically, we own him. And... What do you mean, "We own him"? He's Cal's horse. You know, he's not just a piece of property. He's not like your work. Fandango's not a thing! If you want him to love you, you have to earn it. Just like with me. Claire! Now she acts her age. Come on, Fandango. Come on. Come on, Fandango. Run! Run! Oh, no. Honey, I think I'm gonna take Tucker and go out by Cypress Creek. How many times do I have to ask you to move your hot rod, Tucker? Yes, ma'am. Y'all should maybe go up by Wolf River? Yep. Okay. I got it. I didn't know it was dangerous. Well, he should be all right, as long as he hasn't gone too far. Bad ground out there might hurt his leg. I wanna help. Honey, that's big country. We're gonna look for him. Don't you worry about it. Sorry, Cal. Oh, that's all right. That girl, she's... she got a lot of heart. What do you suppose made her wanna turn him loose? I can't think. Hey, Cal, you wanna jump in? Yeah. You stick around here, in case he comes wandering back. Sure. ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ) Come on, girl. Fandango needs us. Claire? Claire? Claire? Well, there's a possibility that he came down here between these two lakes. He likes that grass a lot. It grows best right there in the lowland. MASON (ON RADIO): Cal, Claire's out there. She took Filena. Oh, my god. All right. We're on it. Fandango! Fandango! Fandango! Fandango! Filena! No. Filena! ( DISTANT NEIGHING ) Fandango? ( DISTANT WHINNYING ) MAGGIE (ON RADIO): Tucker, come back. Go for Tucker. We found Filena. Claire wasn't with her. Mason, you copy? Mason? All right. Okay. Hyah! Hey. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. ( SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( MUSIC CHANGES ) Claire! Claire! Claire! You okay? You rode out here for me. Honey, I would ride anywhere for you. You're filthy. Are you hurt? I'm okay. Wh... where's Filena? Filena's fine. Aw, come here. Don't do that again. Okay. All right? Let's get this horse. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) It's all my fault I admit it I left your dear heart Facing the wall Oh, I can't undo the things That I did Maybe it's better after all Cause I seen you act So happy And I seen your heart Feel blue Now that you're back On your feet again I know I should stay Away from you But although the love That I traded We lost on the way The ashes are flying My passion has burned Out again I'm waiting for the dust To settle down So all of the love that We lost may soon be found ( MUSIC FADES DOWN ) Yeah, these three people. We've, uh, we got a couple of weeks left before the World Cup. And I think Fandango's ready. I just wanna thank you guys for helping me through a difficult time. The decision's mine, and, uh... I want you to ride Fandango in the World Cup. I... I just... I don't know what to say, Cal. I... Then say yes. It's just been... a really long time. Are you nervous about riding, or riding against your brother? A little bit of both. He's your horse... always has been. LILY (O.S.): All right. Come on, aw, nice. Good boy. Hey, there. Hey. Just came to say goodnight. We're gonna head off. It's bedtime, huh? Yeah. Just wanted to also say how happy I am that you decided to ride. Yeah, I'm happy, too. Claire's happy. She took your advice. And according to her, she's very proud of you that you chose to take your advice, too. Oh, your little girl is precious. Yeah. She is. Whoa. Who's that? LILY (O.S.): Uh, looks like my father. Um... Uh, your father. Mm-hm. Um, your proudest moment. You never told me how you felt. I... I felt terrible. And then, we went out for dinner, and we talked. It was a good talk. It was, uh, it was the one I cherish the most. You'll be okay. Oh. Papa. You're riding in the World Cup now. Against me? With him? He couldn't muck my stalls. Get in the car. No. Get in the car. This is not your decision to make. Liliana... No! This is what I want. This is what I've always wanted. And you've kept it from me! Papa, I am a rider. In my heart, I've always been a rider. I've indulged you. I've given you everything a woman could possibly want. Not what I wanted. What you wanted, for you! What I wanted? I wanted you not to get hurt! And you would have. And you may yet. That's not enough? Not when I can't breathe. This is my home now. This your home? Let me be plain. You ride in this Cup, on my horse, with this family... you're no longer my daughter. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): Ladies and Gentlemen... welcome to beautiful Memphis, Tennessee... home of the World Championship Paso Fino Finals Competition. For those of you watching at home... we extend a special welcome for first-time viewers of this storied tradition. and apologize if you tuned in for the regularly scheduled syndication of The Waltons. It will be back next week. And we guarantee that. Oh, and speaking of first-time viewers& we have a new face inside the booth this afternoon. Happy to be here, Jack. Sitting to my right is Ken McGuire, who is making his television debut... following the hip surgery of my usual co-anchor, Ted Billings. Ted, we know you're watching us at home... and we hope for a speedy recovery for you, buddy. Well, thank you for that introduction, Jack. I'm... I'm extremely proud to be part of an under recognized event... one I'll admit that I haven't featured in my online column. But, nonetheless, Paso Fino. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): Paso Fino, that's why we're here today. The Annual World Cup Paso Fino Championship. You know, Jack, I was doing a little research earlier on the, uh, Google. And it turns out that Paso Fino translates directly into "fine step"... which is very fitting, since the entire competition... is a display of the Paso's smooth four-beat gait. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): That's absolutely right, Ken. We're now minutes away from the opening of the competition. Remember not too much Brio. Slow and easy. He likes to show 'em fast for the judges... but, uh, today, just be steady. All right, then. How are you? JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): As always, we begin with the opening presentation. This is where the horses and their riders enter the ring... in order to capture their first impression from the judges. Jack, what's the story with the tuxedos? You know, it makes me feel like ordering a gin and tonic. The riders do look professional, Ken. Very professional. ( MUSIC FADES UP ) JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): And this is very exciting. Riding five-time Paso Fino champion, Fandango, is Liliana Bolivar. We haven't seen her compete for quite some time. And it will be the first time in the last half decade anyone other than owner... Cal Masterson, has ridden in competition with the champion, Fandango. Uh, Jack, I'm not sure if my notes are correct,... but it... but it seems that she's competing against a relative? Number one-fourteen, riding the aptly-named, Diablo. Is this correct, Marzo Bolivar? JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): Your notes are correct, Ken. Runner-up the last five years years are both Diablo and his rider Marzo Bolivar... brother to Liliana. Boo. Sweetie, now come on, that's not nice. KEN McGUIRE (OVER P.A.): Well, if the drama hasn't just ratcheted up a few notches. Boo! This is the plot within a plot... the family drama backlit by the fires of professional equestrian competition. ( MUSIC CHANGES ) Do you think the horse knows he's being judged... or he came in first, or second place, or however? Uh... You know, I met a wise man once who told me a fascinating story. Uh, because thousands of years ago, we used to hunt and eat horses... they really don't trust us. So the fact that these riders and these owners... have such a great relationship with these animals, is truly a remarkable situation. Corto. JUDGE (O.S.): Largo your horses, please. Largo. "Corto," "largo." What do these words translate to, Jack? It's the short and long measures of the gait. Oh, yeah. Here it is. JUDGE (O.S.): Line up. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): Now, they'll move on to the individual portion... of the contest. First up is the figure eight. One at a time, figure eight, and line up. ( TRADITIONAL MUSIC PLAYING ) KEN MCGUIRE (OVER P.A.): Jack, you know, my son can do the same thing on a skateboard. Absolutely blows my mind. Reminds me, when I was a kid... Uh, Ken, you don't have to have an anecdote for everything. Oh. Okay, well, I guess the audience at home... will just not get to hear a good one this time. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): Something these judges are looking for is the "brio"... or determination of each horse. Winning horses can, at times, be the very definition of restraint and control. I've seen horses' skin twitching, their bodies covered in sweat... from the mere anticipation of performance. Just another Thursday night from the choir house. Hey, Jack? Ooh! JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): And you'd think with Fandango being ridden for the first time... by someone other than Cal Masterson... that Liliana Bolivar would have some making up to do. Fortunately for the Masterson camp... Fandango still seems a frontrunner at the current state of the competition. ( MUSIC CHANGES ) KEN McGUIRE (OVER P.A.): Right now, Marzo seems to have better control of Diablo... than his sister has with the defending champ. Only the judges truly know what's on the scorecard. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): Now we come to the voting round... where certain competitors will be sent home. This is almost an American Idol situation. No, I don't think so. Well, minus the voting over the telephone and what not. Okay, we're going to excuse #227. Thank you for your participation. #202, you've been excused. Thank you for your participation. 243, you've been excused. Thank you for your participation. #239, thank you for your participation. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): As expected, the rivals, the siblings... the defending champion and runner-up are moving on to the next round. KEN McGUIRE (OVER P.A.): One wonders if neck-and-neck applies to this scenario. I mean, not that they're racing, but more... dancing. Dancing? The rest of the horses, line up here. It's sort of like tap dancing, isn't it? ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) Ooh! KEN McGUIRE (OVER P.A.): Jack, you know, I usually root for the underdog... but in this scenario, Team Masterson has so much riding on this. Usually, as analysts, we remain impartial to the competition. Where's the fun in that? KEN McGUIRE (OVER P.A.): Dare I say Marzo Bolivar has done a better job here today... than his sister, Liliana? JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): In this round, I would, for once, agree with you. After this round of judging, there'll be only two left in the competition. Oh, kind of a Lakers versus Celtics situation. I'm not sure I understand. What makes something special, is not what you have to gain... but what you feel there is to lose. Andre Agassi. ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): And as expected from the start of the contest... KEN McGUIRE (OVER P.A.): And living up to the hype of the competition. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): Our two finalists are Liliana Bolivar riding Fandango... and Marzo Bolivar riding Diablo. KEN McGUIRE (OVER P.A.): Jack, I'm not gonna lie. At the start of this thing, I... I wasn't very excited... what with the tuxedo wearing and the tap-dancing and such. But I gotta tell you, this has become a real nail biter. I'm glad you're having a good time. On the board in paso corto and line up. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): In this portion, the two remaining finalists... will face off in paso corto. Our riders will take their Finos on a constant loop down the boards... to test the style, grace, and stamina of these animals until a winner is declared. KEN McGUIRE (OVER P.A.): A true showdown. Bolivar. KEN McGUIRE (ON P.A.): The blood, sweat, the tears, the aches, the pains. The years of training. The nerves, the fatigue. The fight, the threat of failure. Jack, this is drama. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): Not a very clean finish for Diablo on that last run. That may have been a very costly mistake. ( MUSIC FADES UP ) JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): I think the judges have seen enough. They're going to converse amongst themselves now. Jack, you've been... you've been doing this a very long time, much longer than I. Um, do you think there's a clear winner here today? Well, it's tough to say that. Liliana certainly did better on the boards... but I think Marzo had the upper hand in the other rounds. ( DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES ) And just like that, Liliana Bolivar and Cal Masterson's champion horse, Fandango... are once again champions. What a fantastic career? What a remarkable competition, and what a truly wonderful afternoon. You were right. JACK PARNELL (OVER P.A.): A very memorable evening... in the history of competitive Paso Fino riding. ( TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING ) You did so good, yeah, you did. ( KISSING ) Hello. Hi. So... Lily, you gave me something back. What's that? I don't know. Just something I knew. Always. When you rode, you know? When you rode. Like a Bolivar. Thank you. You keep it up. Yeah. I will. I missed you, too. I'm sorry. Maybe one day, you... you can forgive me. I love you, Papa. You know that. Come here. Come here. Oh, I know, I love you, too. CLAIRE (V.O.): Sometimes we can't help it when the ones closest to us go away. We feel angry, feel lost. That pain is there for a long time. And then one day, it feels different. When you think about them, it doesn't hurt anymore. And that part inside you gets filled with all the memories they left behind. And they're not lost anymore. Sometimes the ones that left can't come back. But sometimes, the ones that left... find their way home. ( MUSIC PLAYING ) Wondered how I'd feel With the depressed eye When in my head Not a single care Always said it would've gone You would help me one day I can feel it I can feel it coming my way Gonna raise the lid With the sun in my eyes On the line Feels like never before And I feel right at home Beneath the great blue sky 'Cause I've always known It's when I feel alive Always said it would've done You would help me one day I can feel it I can feel it coming my way Gonna raise the lid With the sun in my eyes On the line Feels like never before Like never before Gonna raise the ray On the line Like never before My heart beats fast I feel it in my bones Only time will tell What I don't know Now I know how it feels With the past at my heels Wind in my hair It's when I feel alive Like never before Like never before On the line Like never before Gonna raise the ray With the sun in my eyes On the line Like never before ( MUSIC CHANGES )
