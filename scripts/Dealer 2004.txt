Inforg Stdi and Filmteam presents A film by Benedek Fliegauf DEALER - Hello. - Hello. - Don't you recognize me? - No. - We were in the same class in high school. - No problem. You got a light?... Thanks. You're welcome. - I didn't recognize you. - It's okay. You changed a little. - Well, it's been a fuckin' long time. - Yeah. - See ya! - Yo! Well, it's not the strict diet, that's for sure. Listen, I can't follow him around all day, every second. Not with a man like him. I can't follow him to the bathroom, you know. How am I supposed to get him in? I don't know, but it's a mess. It's going to be a madhouse in there. They're going to take the whole stadium apart. Four trains came only from Romania. They have this agreement with the railway company. I don't know. Six-hundred something whatchamacalits came with this charter plane. From America, yesterday. If he doesn't get out there very fast, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know. I don't know. But you can't pump that man's stomach or give him an enema. I don't know who that doctor thinks he is. The German doc is having a look at him now. I don't know. I hope we'll survive this, get though it somehow, I don't know, then he'll have to go into detox again. That's right. Wait, the guy's here. Good day! We spoke on the phone a half-hour ago. Tell me how much and let's hurry up. - What are you talking about? - What do you mean what am I talking about? I'm talking about Father jvri, you know very well. - Where is he? - Inside. So you'll have to settle it with me. I only do business personally. Fine. Come with me. Just leave it, you don't have to lock it. Hurry. Come on, come on! Let's do it, quickly. Come on! Hurry up! He needs an enema. -That's impossible. It's out of the question. Why is it impossible? It is a simple and safe method. This man is the leader of one of the largest religious communities of the country. You can't give a man like that an enema. We have to keep all sorts of other aspects in mind. I'm talking about spiritual aspects. 800 grams of smoked salmon could not have caused a problem so great. He could have eaten more, or something else in addition. This man is suffering from pathological constipation. What we're really talking about here is an impaction of the bowels, which is in close connection with cocaine intake or withdrawal. His system is seriously poisoned from the toxins that have leaked into his bloodstream from his colon. His circulation is having a kind of panic reaction to the large amount of consumed food. This reaction is further increased by the chronic peristaltic deficiency of peristalsis stemming from the withdrawal of drugs. If you really want to give him cocaine, he says it will be your responsibility and he cannot give further assistance. In addition, he warns you that directly following the ingestion of the cocaine the patient will have a dramatic discharge of excrement, or rather, a kind of explosive diarrhea. So he suggests that if it doesn't go against spiritual aspects, the patient should be undressed and placed on a nylon sheet. Fine, let's do it. Do it, do it. Tell Helmut thank you, the helicopter is waiting for him outside and we'll transfer the money. That's the way is goes. Shit! All because of that one thing. I couldn't fall asleep 'cause that stupid bitch got me worked up. I can't ever sleep as it is. Who the fuck can fall asleep? No one can. So I took three sleeping pills. 'Cause that's all it takes when I get worked up. But it wasn't enough. I thought I might get in the sun bed to relax. They just had one delivered to our fitness center. It wasn't programmed yet. Whatever. I thought I'd get in it for a while. Then I fell asleep inside. It got really hot. I burned to a crisp, man. My kidneys stopped working. So that's it. And everything was going so well, too. A couple of years and I could've quit working. I would've hired some people, and now... But that's the way it goes. Whatever. What do you say to that? How much you need? I dunno. I thought maybe you'd tell me. How much do you need to...? To what? One last time. No... And that's it. I don't want to come back. It depends when you shot last time. Nothing for years. Not even a cigarette. Then a half gram is enough. A half? You sure? That's doesn't sound like too much. It'll be enough. That just goes to show what a good guy you are. You know fuckin' damn well what's going on. I don't have to hear you say don't give up and shit like that. You know what the doctors say? That they'll do a skin graft and everything will be okay. I asked, what skin? Pig skin, they say. You get that? That's just so harsh, man. They want to sew pig skin on me. And then everything will be fine and dandy. Fuckin' butchers, man. My mom's a nut case too. Well, whatever. Hit me! Sorry man. Here's the stuff you asked for, but I'm not doing it. Don't do this to me. I can't do it myself, goddamnit! Well then get someone else to do it for you. Yeah, I know. I know. Don't do this to me, don't. You know I'll pay you. I got money. I've got a whole lotta money now. I don't give a fuck about your money. And me? And me? Man, don't you give a fuck about me? Can't you see I'm suffering? I've turned into a piece of dried shit. You're my buddy. We're pals. Were pals. We went through so much shit together. And this is the last of the shit. And your parents? My parents? Oh they're having a ball. Saying I told you so and all that crap. And they're so happy now that they're right. And now my mom is like, oh, it's all right baby. Everything's all right. Now the family... will be together again. A friend of mine died today. Who? Did I know him? I don't think so. He used to shoot, but he'd been off it for two years. He started working out and opened this beauty farm. And what happened to him? He got burned. What do you mean, got burned? He stayed in a sun bed too long... whatever. And before he died he gave me this key, and told me to do whatever I wanted with it. You were there when he died? Yeah. Jesus. We should sell it. Only I don't have the papers. Yeah, that would be a good idea. You could quit dealing then. It's starting to get to you. You'll relapse again. You said two weeks. Don't worry, I'll get it out. Good, 'cause you can't keep it here. Just quit doing the whole thing. Ten years ago it was okay, but now... I ran into one of our old classmates. Who? I don't know his name. The whole guy was one big tooth. A tooth? One of those sandwich men. And what did he look like? I couldn't see too much of him. He was standing inside this huge tooth. And? What do you mean, and? I thought we might have a conversation. About a tooth? Hi... No I just don't understand why I have to go to Lisbon right now. Just because you're flyin' to Lisbon, now I pack my stuff and go there, why? I don't get it how you think you can control me. I'm sure you mistake me for someone else... ...it has nothing to do with what you're sayin'. I don't know, you just call me, and then I just have to go to Lisbon. No it's so boring, there's nothing we can do there. No, I can't go, understand me? Just forget it, ok? I'm not going to Portugal just because you are my boyfriend and you tell me to go. Think about it, OK? No, I don't know what happened there, that's a different story, no it's another story. France is not a desert like Lisbon and actually I didn't go there for you, but because I wanted to go. Can you imagine that you're not the only one who can do anything? Because you know, I'm also like that, believe me: this is what I am, and not some stupid little bitch you often call me. Yeah, I went to St Tropez to have fun with my friends, 'cause I felt like it, and maybe OK we had some problems, but I don't know how this has got to do with everything. That's what you're paying the cleaning woman for, all right? No, you come to where I work now. Pack up all your stuff and hop over here tomorrow. Okay. Let's play our funny game: just 'cause you don't get it. Let him in, baby. Honey, can't you hear me? Let him in. I asked him over. - Hi! - Hi! Hi Wanda! Sit down. Sit down already. Will you be standing there? It's been a long time! You're clothes won't get dirty if you sit. The place is clean. Yeah, I can see that. Bogika, go and play a little! Bogi! It's okay. I've been calling you for two days and you won't pick up. I even left a message, and nothing. What's up with you? Nothing. I'm fine. I'm fine too. There's nothing wrong with me. The kid has everything she wants. They want to take Bogi away from me. They think Bogi talks so little because she's with me. They think I'm some stinking junkie. They think that Bogi can't talk right because her mother is a stinking junkie. They want to take her to an institution. And they're talking about foster-parents. But why? Everything is in order here. Everything is clean. I love Bogi so much. You know how much I love her. I'm her mother. They won't give me any Depridol either. 'Cause they think that I should stop taking it. But my bones will split if I stop. You know what they asked me? The fuckers asked me what makes me think that Bogi loves me? Give me some Depridol! I'm getting some the day after tomorrow from someone, but I can't hold out until then! I don't have any Depridol. What do you have then? You got some H? Do you? Yeah. Then give me some, please! I'm going to court tomorrow, and if they see me like this, then it's over, they'll take Bogi away from me. I'm shaking, I can't walk like this. And if they take Bogi... Give me some heroin. Do it for me. She'll love you too. Just like she loves me. You just have to tell her... ...that you are her father. Then she'll love you too. You knew, didn't you? You had to feel it. Couldn't you feel that Bogi was yours? Look at her eyes! Those are your eyes. Or do you believe what they say, that she doesn't talk, because she doesn't love me? Bogi loves me. Of course she doesn't say it. Her father never said it either. Don't worry, I won't let them to take her away. I'll get off this shit. I just need time. A lot of time. Come on, get off. Look, see this girl coming? She'll take care of you. - Hello. - Hi. Hi there, I'm Barbara. What's your name? Where did you get this little girl? Her mother is sick. You said something on the phone about her being yours. But you don't have children. Or are you really her father? I'll call you later. Thanks. No problem. But I don't understand. How come you never said anything about having a daughter? - Or... - Her shoelaces are untied. I've come to see Dragan... Dragan? Dragan? You say Dragan? Dragan's right here, can't you see? Did you bring what he asked you for? Yeah. What is it he asked you for again? Pizza. Really? And where's the pizza? I can't see any pizza in your hand. I've never seen a pizza delivery boy without a pizza in his hand... People work in this place. For long years people have been working their fingers to the bone here. My father worked in this store, my grandfather too. This store existed even before it was in this country, understand? Men die very young in our family. And they die sooner and sooner. But my little brother is too young to die. Too young to look like he does. Because you know exactly what he looks like. I don't want to see that dumb shitfaced expression on him again. I don't care what he tells you. And I don't care if he gets the heroin from someone else. And I don't even care if he begs you, understand? I don't want my mother to find the poor fucker with a needle in his vein again, understand? There's my mother. You see my mother? Look into my mother's eyes. Then think. Think while you still can. While you can. That goes for you too, douchebag! I'll take everything from you! I'll take your car too! Get the hell out of here! You can't live on your mother's back forever! Oh, cut the crap. Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad... We did everything just like you said. We weighed it and counted everything out. And everything was just great, you know? Everyone felt real good. And like, thanks and everything, for getting us the stuff. But there's a bit of a problem. Not a big one, just a little one... ...Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad... or rather, a pretty big problem. With Linda. 'Cause she can't seem to get off it. And she's been on it for six days... And she doesn't look like she's flying high or anything. Even though she did everything just like you said. And so... And what? What do you mean, and what? We ate the mushrooms and it was a great trip. And you know, she's a mathematician. And when it was over, she locked herself into her room. And she wouldn't let anyone in. Not even me. And she didn't even answer. And I swear, I thought I would go crazy. And in the meantime, her folks, who are away on vacation, asked me what's up with Linda. 'Cause they're calling her cell and no one's answering. And so like I said that everything's OK. And when she finally came out of her room, I found this notebook in there. - So... - So? And look at this notebook. It's scary, the stuff in it. Look at the end here. And the crazy thing about it... ...is that it all fits together. Only it's complex. And from here on, I'm totally lost. I ate the rest of the shroom. And now I'm starting to get it. Okay, so? So, you need to take a look at Linda. Is this why you called me? When you asked me for mushrooms, I asked you, do you know what mushrooms are? And you said, yeah, sure I know. Now I understand everything except one thing. Why am I here? Come on! - Take a look! - Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad... Nice. That's what she's been doing. Since yesterday. What am I supposed to do now? Just tell me what I'm supposed to do. She's shaking just like before. And she still has two exams this week. Will she be better? 'Cause right now it doesn't look like it. I'm not a doctor. Just tell me what I'm supposed to do. 'Cause I can't call the ambulance, 'cause then they'll take her in. What's gonna happen to her now? If she's lucky, she'll be back in a few days. And if she's not lucky? Then sooner. Don't call me anymore. And delete my name from your cell. Take care of yourselves. - Hello? - It's Wanda. Is she there with you? Bogi's there with you? What are you doing? Where are you, you son-of-a bitch? Tell me where you are! Who do you think you are, taking her away? She's not some goddamn stereo, you shithead, she's a child! All you do is fuck me over all the time. What did you do with her? You hear me? Say something! Answer me, you asshole! Oh, so now you're so quiet all of a sudden, you sneaky little bastard! You want to talk to her?... What's wrong? Bogi! What's wrong? Shall we call your mommy?... Stay here, I've got something to do. - Where you going? - Listen, if anyone asks, tell them you're with your daddy and he'll be back in a minute. Just stay here. Don't go anywhere. Where's your father? Hey! Hey! Shovel!!! Bucket!!! - Hi! You wanna go now? - Yeah. I've been looking for you all over. - Where are we going? - Back to your mom. How can you be such a scum-bag, taking her off without a word? If you dare come near her one more time, I'll have you offed. The stupid fuck you are, you really believed she was your kid. You think I'd bear a child for some jerk-off like you? I should be the one telling you that a junkie will fuck anyone over for a fix? - After you got it. - What? You said it after you got the hit. Fuck this shit. Never, you hear? Don't you ever go near her again. You're not her father! She's my child! You're sick. You were sick before, but now you're shooting too. How can you be so low? You want your daughter to see you sprawled out on the floor knocked out? But you're not sick, right? You're feeling just fine. You're just a shitty pusher, nothing more. Some fucker who's off the smack so he thinks he can be high and mighty. Well, I'm not listening to your lecture. You're a zombie. The heroin's out and what's left? A big nothing. Who do you think you are? How many people's lives have you destroyed? You gave me the first hit yourself, don't you ever forget that. I look like this because of you. It's not my fault, it's yours. That's not how I remember. What I remember is... - forget it. - No, let's not forget it. - No, no, just forget about it. No, let's not. Let's get it over with. I never ever want to see you again. I never want to talk to you again or see your fucking sour face anymore. Then what you'd better do is not call me anymore, crying and begging for me to bring you some heroin. What a fucking bastard! You think you can buy this kid for a hit of heroin? You're the one selling her. You're selling her for heroin. This is what's become of you. Take a look at yourself. Come on, baby, we're going home. Everything's fine now, I'm alright. This is not your daddy. Come on. Come over here to Mommy. I love you. He isn't your daddy. It's open. It's open goddamnit... My old lady doesn't like noise... Look at you. You're a mess. You're hands are ice-cold. I got some real good stuff. Not that blended... ...crap you give me. It was pure, man. Pure as the snow on fucking Mount Fuji. I gave myself the usual hit, and pow! So why you wanna buy from me?! 'Cause I wanna get off it. That's logical. At least I can quit with the stuff you give me. That's how you got off it, right? Yeah, but I quit by not shooting anymore. My mother doesn't like for us to talk about nasty things like this. I'm watching this video, by the way. You seen it before? A few years ago. That's me, a couple of years ago. I was a fucking prince, man. I was a member of the all-star youth team, man. My wrists were like rubber. My mother's saying something here, only I can't hear 'cause this piece of shit is fucked up. Put some volume on it. Quit yelling already! My mother's got company. What's up with her? Haven't seen her for a while. My old lady? Nothing. Since she's out of work, she does these sances. Summoning up spirits and stuff like that. Gods, demons, spirits, things like that. Nice. I was in there myself last time. The Sun God was there, man. That's serious stuff. He's not the guy they built all those temples for. That's just some little demon. The Sun God, man... that's serious shit. I've got your money, by the way. Wait a sec. It's fucking great, man. You just gotta keep quiet. 'Cause then the Sun God won't come. Just the shitty little demons. I've got your money, you know. Wait! But I've only got it in change. But I can cash it if you want. There's no smoking allowed in here. Put it out. Good afternoon. Can you help me take him in? Where? His bed is right here. I have to take him into my room. Everyone's there. It would be better to leave him here. He's freezing cold. He always goes cold at such times. You want to leave me money again. The money you brought me last week is still there. I haven't touched it. Last week? I haven't been here for more than a year. Last year. Last year. Of course, last year, that's what I meant, last year. I thought I might visit you. You know you can always come here. You can stay here, sure. Your room is just how you left it. I haven't touched anything. You can always come home. You can stay here. Your mother'd be happy too if you'd stay. The best thing would be if you'd stay here and not go anywhere. Always running around. What for? You're always welcome here. You know you can always come back. I kept your room like it was. If you want I can clean it up in a few minutes. No, it's fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. You can't spend all your time cleaning. And washing. And tidying. Stop this. But she's just standing there in the window with the rag. Washing the window... She's outside, all the way outside. Just washing and scrubbing the window. Suddenly she slips and falls out and splatters. And, and, and I just stand there. And what are you doing? You're just eating. Eating in your chair, and not doing anything, just eating. But what could you have done? You're still so little. A little shit. And, and, and, what am I supposed to do? Jump after her? Or what? What am I supposed to do? But you're there. What should I do? What am I supposed to do? Do you know what they want to do with your mother? Do you know? They don't want to do it anymore. But they wanted to. And they would have done it. You know? But I didn't let them. Because what they wanted to do was come out here with these machines and everything, and jack-hammers, and make it disappear, level it, fill it with cement. But that's not her grave. That's what they said too. And the workers said that too, you know? And even the municipal council said so, you know? And the doctors, you know? And everyone always said so, you know? That it isn't her grave. Not her grave. That it's just a hole. An indentation. That it's just a dent that her body made in the sidewalk. That her body dented the sidewalk. Mother's grave is in the cemetery. But your mother isn't there. Your mother is only here, you see? She's only here. And not in the cemetery, because she's not there. She's only here. And I told the workers not to bring their concrete, or their cement, or tar, you know? Or gravel, you know? Or their sand and pebbles, because this is a grave. You all understand? A grave. And that would be disturbing hallowed ground. - And they say... - She's dead. What does it matter where her grave is? Mother fell out the window and died. It was an accident, that's all. That hole isn't her grave. Her grave is out in the cemetery. That's what you should be concerned with. Or not even that. Nothing. - Come down with me! - Why? You have to come down with me. Come on! Come. Let's go down together. See, he's here. He's come. Your son has come. I told you he'd come. Say hello. I'm not saying hello to a puddle. This is not a puddle. This is your mother's grave. And you will say hello to your mother. You see, he came. I knew he would come. Say hello. She's there. You see, son? There's her face. That's an oil stain. Don't be angry with him. He doesn't know what to say. He's a nice kid, but... Let's go, Dad! Let's go. I'm not going, I'm staying here for a little while. And you should stay too. Talk to your mother a little. At least say hello. Hello! Hi, Mom! You see? I told you he was a good kid. Okay, let's go now. I'm going. Go, son. Aren't you coming? No, I'm staying here. There's another mug here somewhere. A sip from yours is enough for me. From mine? You can't drink from my mug. I brought you the ball. Thanks. Taste this. Because I think it's sour. It's fine. Are you sure? Absolutely. There's something about you. - You're so... - I know how to make great cocoa. You like cocoa? You hardly said a word this afternoon. And now you're talking. Mom was feeling pretty terrible. That's why I didn't talk this afternoon. But you said she is still unwell now. Yes, but... ...this is different than that. I hate it when she pricks herself. I really hate that... Did you really get her addicted? Was it really you? No way. It's a long story. She took it out of my pocket. At first I didn't even know she was doing it. Mom lies a lot. But not because she's bad, but because she's sick. Of course she's not bad. She really loves you. Do you think you're my father? I don't know. I always ask. Ask? Sure. I always ask everyone she tells is my father... Is she in the bedroom? I want to talk to her. No, you can't talk to her. Understand? You can't. Listen, Bogi! I came here because... Do you feel like coming with me? To ride your bike and stuff. It would be fun. And would Barbara come too? Maybe. I don't know. We could live together. I have this fitness center. With weights... and a sun bed. What's a sun bed? You can get a tan in the winter if you lay inside. We'd have a good time. Until Mom is in the hospital. But Mom isn't going to the hospital. But she has to. She is very sick. And then we'd sell the stuff together? What stuff? Drugs. You sell drugs, don't you? You brought some for Mom today. Can't I talk to her? No. Why? Mom doesn't like seeing you. She always gets upset when she sees you. Then what do you think I should do? Drink some cocoa. It tastes real good. Maybe next time. The ball! You look terrible. What's up? Nothing. I just had a hard day. And it's not over yet. Where's Bogi? At home. I suppose she's boiling heroin for her mother. Jesus. She's a really cute kid. And she adores you. You should be together more often. You might do each other some good. You said you'd quit dealing. You have money. Take a vacation. Get to know some new people. Think over things a little. I've run out of ideas, Barbara. I don't feel like going to this party. Well, you did a good job of putting yourself together anyway. I haven't even gone inside yet and already I'm bored. And how do you like Bogi? I don't understand. I asked a simple question. Do you like the kid or don't you? Of course I like her. Good. Because I like her a lot too. And if anything were to happen to me, you need to look after her. Nothing more can possibly happen to you. You have a daughter. You are her father. She's not my child. Sure she is! It doesn't matter whose she is. All that matters is that if something happens to me, think about her! Don't you feel like coming up to my place instead?! No. I came here to work. Then I'm going to Lisbon tomorrow. Of course. What do you mean, of course? Of course you're going. Take care of yourself. I will. Wait! This is yours, isn't it? Thanks.
