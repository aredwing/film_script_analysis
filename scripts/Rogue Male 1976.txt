You're a liar! - I am sorry... - Sorry?! You tried to shoot the greatest man the world has ever seen and you say you're sorry? It was a sporting stalk. I'm sorry because you don't have the wits to understand... I went to school in England. You say I don't understand English? You understand English! You just don't understand Englishmen! - How did you get here? - I walked. - Walked? - Safest way. - Walked from where? - Poland. - That's over 200 miles! - I got a good bootmaker. Snade, in Crivet street. You are an agent of British Foreign Office intelligence. Actually not. It's been little sign of intelligence in the British Foreign Office for a very long time. You had a gun... with a bullet in the breach. A very high power, very expensive gun. One has to be properly equipped to stalk. What's to stalk without a weapon? We might as well have an egg and spoon race without a spoon. - And a bullet? Does one have to have a bullet? - Habits are habits. Rules are rules! It would've been cricket otherwise. - Life is not a game of cricket, my friend. - No... Pity. Who sent you? The truth. You wouldn't know the truth if it kicked you! I'm a free individual. I came on my own. I brought my passport to clearance. In its first page you will see what His Majesty's Foreign Secretary requests or requires of any foreigners into whose hands I may fall. I suggest you beat carefully! Your passport... sir Robert. Uhm! You think we don't know a forgery when we see one? It's mine, actually. One of your chappies' call'd confirm. Connections are very slow from here. We will pull out your fingernails while we wait. Determined whether it is genuine? You tried to kill him. You? Why? - A man in your position! - What position? An aristocrat. An English gentleman. I would've thought you to be in our side, if anyone would... - On your side? - As it is. - I'm a bit of a problem. - A nuisance, not a problem. You can't just put ME up against the wall, can't you? - We are not barbarians. - Of course there'll be questions. - I don't think so. - Oh, but there will, you see, and you know there will. My uncle... Is a close friend of our ambassador in London. Oh, yeah. Very close. - It's time you grow up, sir Robert. The world is changing. - Yes, for the worse. We must find a way of disposing of you that doesn't upset your uncle. Well, you're author of Rough Shooting, the great Hunter... While a house guest, a welcomed house guest at a weekend shoot among the new leaders of the world -whom you so much admire- sir Robert, unfortunately, went off on his own and suffered a mishap that lead to his death. His body has been returned to London with every mark of respect, and will be interred in the family tomb. I'm sure The Times will give you at least half a column. I wonder what the Foreign Office will make of a body without fingernails Will they take it as a mark of respect on the part of the new order? Good point, sir Robert. May I tell you my little scenario? As a gentleman hunter wouldn't cause a wounded animal to suffer without finishing off. Thank you. So, having wounded a wild boar during the course of a boring afternoon No, my God! The English sense of humour never traveled! You followed it cross country to here. You called it, it charged, you were caught off balance... And really it's most unfortunate, almost idiotic... You managed to grab the edge of the cliff --off course tearing your fingernails to shreds in your frantic efforts to redress the situation-- But... awfully vain. What a lot of trouble you are going to, I must say. Cut above the usual... cut-throat, aren't you? Now we come to your part in the scenario, sir Robert. Believe me: this hurts me as much as it hurts you... as we used to say in Charterhouse. Did you really? Lousy little middle class school. - We can't all go to Eton. - Thank God! Oh, chuck me over and have done with it! The scenario, sir Robert, the scenario! Think of your uncle. Such a family man. We must convince him that it was an accident. Isn't that what we agreed? - We'll come back in the morning with a couple of honest peasants. - To find the body... The more stupid the witnesses are, the more likely the British are to believe them. We must leave you now, sir Robert. The Fuhrer likes to dine properly, and it's getting late. Move! Move! Move, you will it! I know you're there, sir Robert! Gone to ground! Am I right? Gone to ground! Isn't that what a hunted beast does? Goes to ground? But the human animal, being more clever, thinks that the running water will cover his tracks. Poor sir Robert! We'll soon catch you up, sir Robert! Excellent! Excuse me, mein Herr. Nicht sprecht Deutsch. You... don't speak English by any chance, I suppose... - You are English? - Yes. And a sportsman, like yourself. - 'Fraid I had a bit of problem. - Accident? In fact, not. How do you get here? - Make 'em yourself! - Of course. Good man!... Look here: I need a few things, I'm afraid. It's asking a lot, I know. Come up here in the mornings, early, - because before the sun comes up... - Oh, yes. It's still paradise. Isn't it? What's it that you need? Clothes, gloves, shaving title, if possible. Old stuff... nothing they can trace back to you if I may... I'm caught. There's money in my pocket, or should be if you can get your hand in. I can't, without... difficulty. - English? - Yes. I won't tell you who I am or what I've done. Is better you shouldn't know. But I've shaken them off. I know that because I've been holed up here for a couple of days... I needed a bit of dwell; peace and quiet. Sorry to spoil your sport... I'll go get something. Im due back. Hunting, shipping and fishing... do rather tend to dominate things. Good man! I also brought some food. Yes, I could certainly bit. Drink. Brandy. Drink. - You are Jew? - Me? Good heavens, certainly not. Jew? Goodness, no! Get changed. You lie on the bottom of the boat. I'll get you cross. You speak amazing English! I was three years a prisoner of war. Were, really? I was lucky. I went to Kent. Lovely spot. - Not in January. - No, no. On the nippy side then, I must say. Where will you go from here? - Yes... How far to the... mouth of the river? I'm hoping with any luck I'll find a ship. My problem is getting down river, of course. Now, they're largely watching the roads and so forth. But the river... - I don't like the English. - Now we... we can be an acquired taste... Take the boat. It is very brave. If you're caught, I shall say you stole it. I shall endorse... If I'm not? If you're not, I shall tell my wife I sold it. In that case... you'll buy a new one. Yes. I appreciate this, mein Herr. - Scum! - I'm sorry? Those people. You have about 50 miles to go. Go slowly. Yes. Slowly does it. If I have some time. There is a rope in the boat. I hope you have some luck. I shan't shake your hand because my hands aren't really up to it. I salute you. You are a sportsman. - Right. Two minutes for lot: that's what you say. - And if I do it? You get it by both. Otherwise, I get it. That's the bet! Whose two minutes, yours or mine? Forgive me, but you sound you people as though as you need a time keeper. I said you was British! Didn't I say he was British? Soon as you came in, sir. And I thought the same about you two. Two minutes is the bet? Gentleman's decision's final. Agreed? - Agreed. - Ready? Go! - Sail tonight? - I am. He's not. Condition he will be will not allow... - I'm going out with... - Very nice. - British ship? - British troop. Welsh Maid. Nr. 2 dock. You can't miss it. Cleanest, smartest bit of scrap in the harbour. - How's the old man like? - Like old men. No one likes him. Old-school. Everything by the book. Luckily, old Vaner is a bit more human. Vaner? Is that the mate? Right. Not easy, right? But fair. Have to give it that. I mean he can be a right swine, if you know what I mean, sir, but fair with it. - Are you looking for a ship, sir? - Yes, I am, rather. Don't bother to go by the Welsh Maid; that's my advice. - Oh, how long's the time? - Oh, good heavens! - Time's up! - You gave him too long, sir! I've done it! Look, look. It's my fault. So let me pay for both sides. Another round up here! Sing! See you later, guys! Ok, buddy! - Mr Vaner's on board? - I think he is, sir, yes. - Who I say is looking for him? - Just tell him I'd like a word, would you? If possible... - So you're old Vaner. - I'm Vaner. I am Robert Hunter. How'd you do? The cook seems to think we know each other. - I heard your sailors tonight. - And? I had a bit of trouble with our friends the sausage eaters. I need a passage out badly. Can't be done. No accomodation. Try a liner. What if I could but I can't? The old man's a stickler, I'm afraid. When he comes back I know what he'll say. You don't look like a stickler, Mr. Vaner. Show me where I can hide and, on my word, no one will see me before, during or after we make it to England. I hate to dramatize, but its literally life or death. - They've knocked you about. - Yes, they did rather. They knock everybody about. Women included... Yes, women included. Better things to be done with women than knock them about... I think you're probably right. Tell you what we got: Spilled water tank empty. It'll fancy for a few days. Few days... - Where do we dock? - Right up river. Wandsworth. Wandsworth, do really? I think I never been to Wandsworth. There is a first time, isn't it? I'll show you your "quarters". It's a bit of luck, sir. Just your size. That's the screw you don. So here's some rations and the best of luck. We'll disconnect the overflow pipe. It'll give a bit of ventilation, ok? It's an opening into the captain's cabin, actually, so you can hear him singing Rock of Ages in the tub, and I hope you survive that. See you in Wandsworth. - What is this, Mr Vaner? - Evening, sir. They want to search the ship. Did they see the ensign we fly, Mr Vaner? This is a British ship! They're looking for a criminal. No one searches this ship without my saying so! - Any stranger's on, Mr. Vaner? - No, sir. If my officer says there's no one, there's no one. I'm not gonna miss that tide. I liked you to see a patch of gray sky, sir. You're back where you belong. Thank you, Mr Vaner. The old man is getting his Sunday vest suited so he must not be here. Not too bored? No. I recited heroic poems to see if I could. Didn't you? Well, they say your trouble's over now, sir. England! Home and beauty! Hello, Uncle. Nephew, may be. Now what the devil have you been up to, Bobbity? - It sounds as if you know. - It sounds as if I don't want to know. - Know what? - People telephoning at all hours... Home, urgent, in the middle of a rubber. Can I say where you are? How can I possibly say where you are and count trumps at the same time? It's not business of mine where you are. You know, I've even got... what's his name... Champagne Charlie on the line I'd simply no idea that you were on the German Embassy's dining list I thought I would be safe when I got home. It seems that I'm not out of the wood yet. You know, you're a fool, Bobbity, you're a fool! What happened to your eye? Someone stomped a cigar on it. Uncle, I'm a fool who happens to be in a mess. Not for the first time. Who did this? A follower of your friend Adolph. What? The mad Muller? I know he brings pretty funny folks, but isn't going too far! What on earth did you do? Pointed a gun at his master. They followed me to England. I didn't think they'd do better. They're watching my digs. Ah, they do? Look, Bobbity, you better clear out right away. Here is my advice. Bug off, bug off somewhere... to Saskatchewan. Yes, Saskatchewan. Where's that, by the way? Canada. Good God. Because you've made an oversize mess of things, Bobbity, outside, and Neville is furious. - Neville? - Yes, Nev... the Prime Minister. I know, I know, he may look like a middle class denture salesman, but he's got the role of His Majesty's First Minister... and he is furious! Or so I've been told. I can't see that it makes much difference to his appearance. Uncle: what you think I should do? Bobbity, I'm a member of the government. How should I know what people should do? Uncle, uncle, uncle... I AM serious. You're not more serious than I am. Turned out that you could be extradited! If it's officially known that you're still in the country, you could be sent back in chains, if they requested it. Bobbity, you see: shooting heads of state is never in season. Even if they are jumped-up corporals they are protected! Like... like ospreys. So you know what you are, Bobbity? You're an outlaw! - You are an outlaw. - Can't you suggest what I do? Do? Like any fellow with a shred of decency does when he blows his copybook: You make yourself scarce and not embarrass your friends! Now you're sober you realize that this country could be involved in a war over this. - It may be involved in a war anyway. - No, no, no. Nonsense, nonsense. Neville has this Hitler fellow mesmerized. You wait and see. They are out to kill me. No. No. You're exaggerating, Bobbity. This chappie you saw was probably some bookie runner. - In Mayfair? - Yes, in Mayfair. Things are not what they were. They never were, were they? My poor boy You know: I remember warning once before not to be provocative! That's not a matter I'm prepared to discuss and you know it! I liked her! I loved her! Sorry, sorry. Best keep off the subject. So: you're telling me to go to Hell, is that it? Oh, why not? There's no place like it in my experience. Bobbity: I'm only sorry I'm not young enough to go with you. You won't tell anyone you'd seen me? Don't be insulting, Bobbity! - Robert! - Saul! Good Heavens! You look like an advertisement! I'd say I look rather democratic. I bought the rig in what they call a Department Store. Fact is: I rather think I'm being followed. Curious that you turn out, matter of fact. Rather a case of "speak of the devil. Oh, why should you be doing that? Because we had some very odd enquires about you. Does the name Quive-Smith mean anything to you? Quive-Smith? Quive-Smith? Nothing. - Anything to eat? - Only my lunch. A few gull's eggs and half a bottle of Moet-Chandon '28. You are welcome to. Or there's potato biscuit with a side of petit beurre. He's a Major. And he says he's by way of being an old companion in arms of yours. A Lancer? English is he? Couldn't be more so. The fact my name was Abrahams got him congestion of the larynx. He said he knew you and that he is the bearer of information to your advantage. An inheritance. Some fellow soldier. The Colonel, no doubt, left me the regimental silver? I don't think. Bring in my champagne and gull's eggs for Sir Robert, please, Mr. Peale. Quive-Smith? Never heard of him. Anything else funny going on? Anything else, Mr Peale? Not directly, sir. Only we do have a queer customer outside, feeding the ducks. - Been the whole week off during office hours. - And another one just turned out in Dearball St. He's been seen on in a chat with the duck-feeding gentleman for the last couple minutes or so. Since sir Robert's taxi drew up. They've broken cover. My gaudy plumage. Works an appetite. I'll get the refreshments, sir. See what else anyone knows. Where does Peale get his information? From leaning out of the window all day? - No, no, the Union. - Union? Private detective's union. They spot outsiders in no time. As far as the divorce business is, we have to brief as many of them as we do barristers. They like to keep in the right side of Mr. Peale. What've you been up to? I took a pot at your chum Adolph. Adolph? Adolph? Adolph. You must be loopy! You know why, Saul. No one else does, but you do. - Rebecca. - You shouldn't blame yourself, Robert. I blame myself. And I blame them. - She knew what she was doing. - So did I. And I should have stopped her. You couldn't to. Anyway... Here we are, sir Robert. Seems he's still there, sir. If I may suggest, sir, I'll accompany you when you go out. I doubt they'll try anything in the street... not if there are two of us. You still pack your right hook, do you, Mr. Peale? I never go anywhere without it, sir. Robert, you can be absent minded in your own, do you? Trying to eat gull's eggs with your gloves on? I have my reasons. My hands still aren't too pretty to look at. Then I won't look at them. Better still, alow me. What are we gonna do about you? Well, don't suggest anything legal because there isn't anything. My uncle's made that very clear. Neville and his chums will ship me back to our friends as soon as look at me. Sooner. I want to settle my affairs and I'll need all the cash you can muster. I may be, as they say, underground for some time. No trouble there. Do you keep cash in the office, do you? When your name is Abrahams, my dear Robert, you may eat with the best people and even sleep with one or two of them --when they're in the mood-- but you don't trust them; - not ever... not entirely. It may be peace in your time, but I don't think it's likely to remain peace in mine. Oh, Saul, for God's sake, you're as English as I am. And you're half-Irish. Here's a body belt with 2.000 quid in it. and a 100 in sovereigns. Any fellow Hebrew might give you a decent break for gold wherever you are. Saul, you are an ass! Now: what about the land? The documents are ready. You want the present tenants to inherit in the event of your death, subject to the creation of the joint trust for their heirs. Wasn't that it? - Good man. - Here you are. Splendid, splendid... Now: one more thing. If a coroner check on my body concludes that I committed suicide, don't believe one word of it. - I'll get on it personally. - You do no such thing! A corpse isn't worth the fuzz. - Just remember. - I should do that. I promise. - Guess I owe you another one, don't you? - On your account. Don't you worry. Her's one of them. And there, if I'm not mistaken, comes the gallant Major Gallant. He has a good tailor, I say that. Hailing a taxi cab once takes two... My pleasure, sir Robert. Take a shilling compartment, sir. A shilling compartment, please. - Good luck! - Good luck to you, sir. Now! How can I go to... Wimbledon Park? Well, sir, you go to Leicester Square, and Charing Cross. How much time have you got? It's a little complicated... All the time in the world. - Ticket, sir. - I'm in a hurry, damn you! Take the northern line. That would take you to Charing Cross. Charing Cross, district line, and then all the way to the Park. Counter's there, sir. Going aboard! Funny the way they always do that! One must have patience! Sir Robert! What a pleasure to see you! - Quite wrong, Jessel! You haven't seen me. - Sir Robert? I'm not here, Jessel. You haven't seen me since my last trip. - Of course not, sir Robert. - Here is the list of things I need. - Bivouac? - Ah, ha. - What about a firearm? - No. Just I don't think I'll play that way. Quite right, sir Robert. - I'm not a criminal, Jessel. - Off on another of your trips, I presume, sir Robert? When you get the stuff, I'll be at the entrance of Wimbledon station. "The Evening Standard"! Horrible murder! Read all about it! The Metropolitan Police wish to interview a tall, well dressed gentleman in his early forties. The booking clerk described him as having no fingernails on his right hand. I came as quick as I knew how, sir Robert. But the West End? They got police, and I-Don't-Know-What everywhere. - I suppose they are both at this game. - Thank you, Jessel. - Will you be all right, sir Robert? - Oh, yes. Meanwhile... Of course. Even I don't know who I am. I never hunted at the Cattistock. Why not? Why not? I remained in Dorset once before in my life. Stop! You alight! Five minutes. I don't wanna get behind. Pub's shut. Give me some water. Oh, how really weary I am! - Do I look funny? - Funny? You? No. Why? What a frankly superb conveyance! - Sorry? - The bike. I've never seen anything quite like it. - There isn't anything quite like it. - Gerald built it. - Gerald? - I am Gerald. How'd you do. You'll never believe this, but I've been hunting high and low for a thing like this. OH, Gerald was thinking of manufacturing them. Won't it, Gerald? - As a business. - I've given the matter some consideration. Yes, I don't doubt. Now, how much would a thing like this cost? - What?... 15 quid. - That much? - About. - 15 pounds? You said you could make... - Frankly, is academic. - Sorry? Point is: I need the bike right away. But we live in Leicester. Do really? I have an uncle who lives near Leicester. - Oh, how lovely! Would we know him? - I don't think so. We'll have to go back by train. - Well, I'm very sorry if I spoiled your holidays. - What the hell! Suppose we say... Or was it in guineas? What do you say? - I'll be sorry to let her go. - In other words ... Done! Thank you. Here: five... No one will ever find this. No one! Ever! This is ours! Forever! It's ours, but not forever, Robert. We must go back. I must! You knew I must. The world won't go away. Not even for us. Damn the world! They trust me... They rely on me. I must. Without me... Without you...? Not yet, Rebecca. Not yet. Darling Bob... She walks in beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies And all that's best of dark... ...and bright Meets in her aspect and her eyes Hullo, cat. You like that, don't you? I'll call you Pussy... Bugger... Oh, no... Dark? Asmodeus? Yeah. Asmodeus. I'm Folsham, Professor Folsham. There's maybe a parcel for me No, sorry. No parcel to that name at all, sorry. Maybe a letter then? There you are! Folsham. Kettle's boiling, Mom. Excuse me. "A sinister stranger without fingernails is hunted in Dorset this week..." - Maman, I want to drink my tea! - You do as you're told! - May I have my letter, please? - You'll have to wait. - Madam, kindly satisfy yourself. - May you keep away from me! - This letter is indeed addressed to me and I regret to tell you... - I will scream! I don't doubt it. Your behaviour is unworthy of a position of trust. I feel duty bound to report it. Good day to you, madam! As your legal advisor my opinion -pedestrian as it may be- is that you should go to the police, tell them the truth and be damned with your addled ideas of duty and honor. If England is embarrassed by your existence, so much the worse for England. Noblesse does not always oblige. No. Only when you wish it didn't. Bernie, March! There is! At him! Of course, Major Quive-Smith! A man in your position: I'm happy to tell you what I know! The local constabulary almost nabbed him in Dorset. The South post mistress had her suspicions aroused but the local's reaction was a shade slow. Well, he was away before they got to him. He won't be within a 100 miles; it is an expert opinion. When it comes to an expert, William, I think I'll rely on Sir Robert. Thank you, Muller. Rule is simple and infallible: Find his waterhole, and patience will surely bring your quarry within your sights. Sir Robert? Sieg heil! Major, look out! Come back! Come back, you idiot! Some stupid animal, and you go make a fool of yourself! - I'm no country man, major. - You're no man at all! - Better be dead. - He is, Major. I saw. Well, the dead man appears to've gone to ground, isn't it? I'm not prepared to root around in the dark for a wounded rat. Discipline, Quive-Smith. Discipline, discipline. .38. Close, Robert. Close. An elephant separated from the herd is known as a rogue male. He is isolated, and he is dangerous. The Allmighty look after the rogue male. We hope. We hope... Oh, Mr. Drake? I'm Quive-Smith. Your wife and I spoke on the telephone. Oh, yes, major, indeed. Is not much of a day for sports, I'm afraid. I'm a patient man, Mr Drake. I'm willing to wait. - What's so much about? - Not a lot. Not a bird. I haven't seen so much as a robin out there, all summer long. Perhaps some cat is out there... Can't trap him and can't shoot him. Yes... I'd like to see that room I made your wife talk about it. Hullo, Asmodeus! You smelled the sardines, didn't you, eh? Not up outside really? What's up outside? You and me: What a pair, eh? What a pair, you evil villain! One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impair'd the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress Or softly lightens o'er her face... Well, we will have to sweat it out, my pretty. We'll have to sweat it out. Mr Quive-Smith? I must say your mom makes the most delicious apple crumble! Do you like some more? Oh, yes... Just a little. That's fine. No, thanks. Hullo, Asmodeus! Yes, it's not precisely a bed of roses, isn't Asmodeus? Messy the big man is, isn't it? Have they gone or haven't they? Have they gone or haven't they? Oh, that must happen! They came after my cheese again! Entered there and down the garry. I knew it was a stealer of them! I don't really think so, you know, Mr. Drake. So how was it? They broke the roof? Look at that. Deathwatch beetles got in that. I've came across this once, in East Riding. A time bomb. Chap fell right through the roof and broke his neck, poor fellow. I shouldn't fetch yourself. You are right, Major. Morning's time enough to worry. Quire right, Mr. Drake. Good night! A wise hunter does not disturb frightened game at night. Thank you, sir Robert. Asmodeus? Asmodeus? Asmodeus? Sir Robert? Sir Robert? Can you hear me? I hear you. How are you? Surviving! You had a lucky escape! Attemptly, however. One does not abandon a wounded beast, does one? One finishes it all. It wouldn't be cricket otherwise, would it? - What? - I did not speak. Shall I tell you something funny? While my capacity for laughter is somewhat limited at the moment, you can try. The night you lost patience... Last night, by George! Wasn't it? I didn't lose patience! The night you lost patience! I'd already given Drake notice that we were off. I'd already decided that you got clean away. Oh, I knew that you were somewhere about, but we'd been searching down by the spring and down in the old quarry and I concluded that we missed the bus". Funny, isn't it? Hilarious. - Shall we get down to business? - Business? What business? If you are going to kill me, kill me! Oh, my dear fellow: I don't want you to die. You could always donate me to the Whipsnade zoo, I suppose. There will be no need for anything as drastic, sir Robert, at this particular juncture. If my friends take my advice, and they might well, They'd tell me to let you go back into circulation just as if nothing had happened. On certain conditions. Look here! You won't get any more out of me than your Gestapo did! So don't waste your time! My Gestapo? They are not mine. I am as British as you are. - Now what exactly do you want? - I don't want to deceive you in any way, sir Robert. So I think I better get back to my friends and clear with them exactly what I propose we should do. You wouldn't mind hanging on for a day or two, will you? I can't get out. but I don't suppose you will be coming in. I assume you're familiar with the end game known as stalemate. Well, this stalemate is humour to me, sir Robert, if we must raise the subject. Look, let's not play bluff, shall we? You've only one course, and that is to resign gracely. oh, and please don't try burrowing your way out by some ingeniously route. My chap is going to be out here whenever I'm not and he has such a nervous disposition he would probable shoot the moon if you came out unexpectedly. We'll talk tomorrow. Pleasant dreams! Sir Robert? Sir Robert, are you there? I'm still here! So am I! Because I got some good news for you. We'll have you out of there inside the hour. You will be free to go home, to your place. You'll be in time for the first of the pheasant. I'm very glad it's worked out this way. I'm sure I would. I have enormous respect for you; personally, you know, Sir Robert. A member of a party, Major, which respects nothing but power and brute force! And you're a man to go into the jungle with, sir Robert! And that's the highest tribute I can offer! Our party needs men like you! What is it exactly what you want me to do? It's time to tell. I have a piece of paper out here. Here, bring it here... What I'll do is: I'll shove it down your blowhole on the end of a stick. All right... Got it? First catch a mouse, and then give him the cheese. Absolutely right! Absolutely right! Oh, this is rubbish! The British Government knew nothing whatsoever about my trip and you know that perfectly well! If I put a wager I'll toss one way or the other about what anyone knew or did not know. Your uncle is in the Cabinet. Who's really going to believe that you weren't given the nod? - Weren't you? - No. Look: I'm as British as you are, sir Robert. I wish this country great, just as you do. That document will never see the light of day unless Neville, of the Jews forces into war, and then only to prove to public opinion, --to the people of Britain-- that it's a war that's been forced on the Fuhrer by pansy boys and weeping willies. - I don't sign lies! - Truth! What is the truth when it comes down to it? What is true is the truth! And what's the truth about this, so called, sporting stalk? I wanted to see if it could be done. You wanted to kill, I presume, because you thought it would help. - Help? - Your country. If you like... In other words: even if the Government, the politicos, knew nothing about you... you were, as it were, acting for Britain. - I don't see why all this matters! - I'm sure you do, sir Robert. You mentioned signing lies: It happens to be the truth what I'm asking you to sign. - I don't agree! - Your actions agree, sir Robert, which is more to the point. Let's us say that your motives were patriotic. That makes them the same as mine. You and I, sir Robert, belong on the same side! We are two of a kind! Don't assume that because we both go to a good tailor we are on the same side. We are not! Look: you're going to do as I say or say your prayers. As simple as that. Sign and be damn with it, or else... Aren't we all in a great hurry? Well, I can't stand around here talking all day. I should get cramped. Breathe some more of that lovely fresh air you got in there, my dear fellow, and tell me how it feels in the morning. Some company for you. A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent. I hope by tomorrow you'll be in the mood to be sensible. By then, the atmosphere in there ought to be conducive to reason. I must go back. They trust me. They rely on me. I must. Without me... Without you...? Not yet, Rebecca. He'll be sorry, Asmodeus, old friend. He'll be sorry! Splendid morning, Mr. Drake! Right like, sir, sure, to wander Yes... Well, I shall profit from it while I can. Come along now, and get some grab. And cheer up! I don't suppose you'll be needed much longer. Morning! - Sir Robert! - Yes? I said "good morning"! - Did you? - Manners, my dear fellow, manners! One must preserve the proprieties, you know. - How are you this morning? - Reasonable. Tha air out here is splendid this morning! How is it in there? - Sir Robert? - I'm still here. You know: honestly, Sir Robert, I never imagined a man like you could be so thoroughly unreasonable. Didn't know that reason was something you cared much about. This is a nonsense, you know: submitting yourself to this stressful adversity. Really it is! You know, Major, I've been thinking. Purpose of the exercise, my dear fellow. Even if I... I sign this famous document of yours, whatever useful it'd be? No one's get to see it. There isn't going to be a war. Your Fuhrer has promised and we all know that, if... if a man like that gives a promise... I tell you, it's a pure formality! Unless someone on your side gets up to some nonsense and tries to foment a war against this country's natural allies... You see... - Sir Robert? - What about...? - What about...? What? What about what? This chappie of yours... Chappie? Your chappie! How much does he know? How do I know that I'm not going to be blackmailed? He's a Swiss. Forget him! The Swiss are people of quite astonishing dullness and repetitive, my dear fellow. A combination nurtured by generations of democratic governments and milk chocolate. - I'm rather fond of both. - Not that, Sir Robert. The British Lion is losing its teeth on account to the one and its will to fight because of its addiction to the other. Why prolong this ludicrous debate? Sign! Sign and then... You're a natural leader, sir Robert. I know it; you know it. Now, what place do you have amongst the rats and the rabbits? My place amongst the rats and the rabbits is, I assure you, none of my choosing. So you want a world that belonged to the Jews and the niggers, do you? Cause that's what democracy is. Mr. Roosevelt and his Yankee Doodles or the Great Russian bear scrolled across Europe, with England between its paws! I don't know, I don't know...! I can't breathe. I can't think! Sign the paper, man! You could think later. I got a bottle of Piper in the car. I bust the pen! Bust the pen? You are an ass! A pen is the least of our problems! Here I am, Major ... So you are. - Don't kill me, sir! - Name? - Muller, sir. - Muller, of course... Have you seriously took to the work, Muller? Burying a fellow human being alive came quite naturally to you, didn't it? I thought you were one of the Major's men, sir. He said you were. Oh, sir, my wife... - Want to see her again? - My God, sir, I swear ... Let's swear quietly. Or better still, save your breath. We got work to do. Go on, man, pull him right in! My God, sir! Very cozy! - What air is it in there! - Yes, sorry about that. I wouldn't say anything, sir. Ever. To anyone. You can trust me. Yes, I can... Rather depressing, really! Now here's what we'll do: after dark we topple down to the farm... because we have to collect our gear, don't we? - But I'll ... - Looks like rain. I'll wait in the car, like a gentleman, and you will fetch up the bags. Here, the Major -that's I-, as he so often remarked we were two of a kind, At least, to the casual eye. I'm sorry to abandon you, but all good things must come to an end. Goodbye, Major! Goodbye dear, and remember: don't renounce your Queen too soon! I'll remember, Major! Premature exposure may come out to be fatal. Good bye, major! - I'd like to give you a kiss, Major! - You might catch a cold, my dear. Just stay in the dry. Bye, bye, now! Don't get too wet! I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently, this country is at war with Germany. Anyway, Neville asked me would I care to renounce my duties. Frankly, since I never quite known what this were, I readily agreed. Oh, yeah! Oh, there you are, Bobbity! I wondered when you'd surface. I expected you a bit sooner, to be honest. Oh, yes, but I couldn't find a taxi cab. That! Of course, that explains it. Cause I had a word with Winston. And he says that if you care to go round by the Admiralty, he has an idea that might be rather up your stream. - Fine. I'll go around. - Do that, do that... Oh, Bobbity! You know that spot of trouble you talked me about... Well, now it seems that Neville has passed the word -informally, of course- that the whole thing can now be unofficially regarded as officially... Dead and buried? - Yes, if you like it like that. - Fine. I'll go see Winston. Do that. Get him to give you a good job right away before he gets kicked out. Because I don't think he's going to last any longer... Ok. Thanks, uncle. Bobbity, I'll be at the Athenaeum, later, if you feel like a little plain supper in some middle class company... Thank you, uncle. That's my nephew, Bobbity. Splendid fellow! But so silly! Do you know what he did before? Oh, you're just not going to believe this, but he actually tried to pop Hitler. And missed. Very odd. He's usually quite a decent shot. My plan is far advanced. I recognize that I may not get away alive, but this time I shall not hesitate. And that's really all that matters to me, without you. English subs by claudg1950@yahoo.com, Buenos Aires Lines to be revised:
