Before went to hundreds of years - before it was known who is out of a great artist. Now, need to watch only ten years back. It is an exciting, because the artist can be found - and the influence of cultural history. I've always have been Matisse. - I do not know his work. I am interested in contemporary art. We live in exciting art history through. It's like a renaissance. / P But the need to keep it, what to buy. / P Art does not look as nice, when its value drops. / P It is zenilist trade.
