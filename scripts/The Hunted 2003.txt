God say, "You can do what you want, Abe, but the next time you see me coming, you better run." Abe says, "Where do you want this killing done?" and God says, "Out on Highway 61." The Serbs have taken over this... Albanian village. They're killing everyone in sight. It's not a war, it's a slaughter. The Serbian commander is in that mosque. This is the third village in a week he's destroyed. We are to identify and neutralize him. We will proceed under cover of NATO air strike, commencing... right... about... now! Move! I'm in the nest. Copy that. Raven is in the nest. Cover fire, on my mark. Three... Two... One! Sergeant First Class Aaron Hallam. Yes, sir. It is my privilege to present to you the Silver Star, one of our nation's highest awards for valor. Your bravery, sound judgment, and outstanding resolve are an example to all soldiers. Your courageous actions are the bedrock upon which peace and democracy have always been built. Congratulations, Hallam. Hey. What happened to you? You stepped on a snare, didn't you? Easy. Take it easy. Be still. Be still. All right, let me have that. Nasty thing. All right. Next time you see one of these, you go the other way. Okay... Here we go. You're good, you're good. All right... Okay. Now get out of here. Anybody here With the initials J.W.? Yeah. This yours? Yeah, it is. What the...?! No more snares on wolves, guys. I got him. He was down there. What? I saw him. You need all that equipment to kill a deer? That's how we make sure they're dead. You guys don't look like deer hunters. When you kill with your own hands, there is a reverence. Is that right? There is no reverence in what you do. Where's your weapon? Holy sh... You're not here for the deer, are you? What's that? You think you can hunt me with those rifles? Your rifles against my knife. What, are you nuts? What do you think? Yeah, well, don't push it, asshole. Where the fuck are you? Come on, baby. Oh, God! You want a little antifreeze with that? It's not that cold out. Maybe not to you. Thought you were on the wagon. Wheels fell off. You running a fever? No. I'm tired of the goddamn cold. Not too crazy about the thaw, neither. Well, get a hot water bottle. Keep you company at night. I don't want a hot water bottle. I want to go down to California for a few weeks, catch some thoroughbreds at Del Mar, do a little fishing. They say the yellowtail jump right into the boat this time of year. Sam, the yellowtail's not running this time of year. Hello, Ted. L.T. How'd you know it was me? I saw your pigeon-toed tracks. What are you doing this far north? Van Zandt wanted me to show you something... personally. It's been a few years. Okachobi, 1996. Yeah, your agents got so scared of alligators down there. Remember that one guy shit in his pants? Mike Haney. Yeah, that was funny. You sort of disappeared after that. Yeah, I worked a few more, and then I quit. Been in Portland for three years now. We've reached out for you a few times. L.T., let me ask you something. Yeah. What the hell are you doing out here? Working for the wildlife Fund. You went to a lot of trouble to get yourself up here. You know, you're a hard man to find. No, I'm not. How hard am I to find if you found me? Van Zandt thinks it's important. He thinks everything's important. This one's different. I don't do that kind of work anymore. Why don't you have a look? I really don't want to go back there. All we're asking you to do is take a look, L.T. Hey, Tom, can we get prints off that paper? Yeah, we sure can. Please do, and the door handles. Harry, I understand that, but I'm concerned about the number of SWAT agents. I want to take these guys alive. Reed, we need to deploy some of your men on the other side of the canyon. I want to contain this area and establish a perimeter. That's your call, Abby. We're here to help. Bonham, are you all right? No! I hate those things. I'm afraid of heights. I'm Abby Durrell. I'm the ASAC here. I'm not sure how much Harry told you, but... Tell me what he told you to tell me. We'll take it from there, okay? Okay. The two men were found half a mile from here. They were killed with a hatchet, then gutted in what looks like a ritualistic fashion. Every vital organ was cut. I got a deputy talking to the local Paiute chief. There's no Paiute ritual for gutting a human body. The dead men were both dressed and quartered the way you'd quarter a deer. Paiute are upset about... Paiute wouldn't dress and quarter a couple of deer hunters unless... What? He was going to eat 'em. There were two men killed the same way last week in Washington State. They were Forest Service Rangers, Which was how we got jurisdiction. Where are the bodies? We sent them to the lab yesterday. You need to see them? No. You've got too many men and horses in here. All these tracks, this is, uh... chaos. Do they have a deer stand or any coolers for packing meat? Not within a five-mile radius. Nothing. You have a campsite? Still looking. What do you know about the victims? As far as we know, just a couple of businessmen from Medford. What else can we do for you? Nothing. Ask everybody to fall back. Bobby, let's get everybody out of here. You guys, everybody, let's go, let's fall back. Come on. Let's go! Yeah, everyone! This is him. Who? The guy that did it. At this point, we're not sure how many killers there were. Just one. How do you know that? He left a signature right there in that tree. Mr. Bonham, the deceased were two able-bodied men. -Mm-hmm. -They had rifles With sophisticated scopes on them. One of them had a nine millimeter handgun stuck inside his jacket. Yeah. Now, it seems unlikely that one man With a hatchet could possibly... He didn't use a hatchet. He used a knife With a serrated edge on one side and a filet blade on the other. You're saying that one guy with a knife threw it at this tree and then killed those two hunters? Yeah. He wore a size ten shoe with no tread, almost like a slipper-- kind of like this one. He's out there. Oh, you're not going out there alone. That's the way I work. Take this. I don't need that. Humor me. The battery's fully charged, so please make sure you leave it on. Okay. You don't have a gun? I don't like guns. Well, how much time do we give you? If I'm not back in two days, it'll mean I'm dead. L.T. Remember me? No. You taught me. I taught a lot of people. How come you didn't answer my letters? How come you're chopping up all these people? Did you see the scopes they were using? They weren't hunters, L.T. They were sweepers. You're going to have to come in, son. Move up. -He's down. -Down. He's down! Stay back. Don't touch him. I found a weapon. We see you! D2, move in. Call it in! Move in! 30 yards on your right! Bring him in. Clear it out! L.T. Harry. You did a hell of a job. Thanks. He's one of yours, isn't he? -Yeah. -That's what I thought. -He's our man? -Yeah. Any idea why? No. That'd be your job. Would you like some coffee? No, thank you, ma'am. You don't have to talk to us if you don't want to. I understand that. How about telling us your name? We could start with that. He knows my name. Why don't you tell me What happened in the woods? Did you know six billion chickens will die in slaughterhouses this year? What does that have to do with what happened in Silver Falls? What if there was a species above us in the food chain? How do you think you'd feel if that species lost total respect for us and started slaughtering us, Wholesale? I don't know... but it's very interesting. Do you understand it? Oh, yeah. Good. What is it you want to tell Mr. Bonham you don't want to tell me? I'd like to talk to him about Operation Black Eagle and Mongoose, Cobra... Shut up! You want to get yourself killed? His name is Aaron Hallam. Sergeant First Class Aaron Hallam. You do remember me, sir. You're talking about shit that never happened. They're recording this, bud. Good. Then there'll be a record. And that record will never say What you want it to say, Will it? Then what am I doing here, people? Mort, you have got to help me out here. Is this our guy or not? I know there are variables, Mort. There are always variables, but we can't indict a variable. Hey, boss. Sir, we understand you have a man named Aaron Hallam in your custody. How much do you know about Mr. Hallam? Born in 1968. raised in Barrow County, West Virginia. High school equivalency, although he scored off the charts in science. Joined the Army at 18. That's the strange part. What's that, sir? Well, it doesn't really tell us any more about him. The record's incomplete. Not even a date of discharge. Sergeant Hallam is unofficially listed as missing in action, sir. Unofficially? That's a cover. That means he's still doing work for you. We're here to take possession of your prisoner, sir. This is not a military base. Your man very likely killed and mutilated four hunters on federal land. I think you should take a look at this... sir. Unless we've been invaded by a foreign power and are officially at war, you don't have any authority here. Look, I know you want to get out of here, but we're waiting on the blood results, and I need your statement. You ever used that thing? Do you mean did I ever shoot anyone? Yeah. Would you ask a guy the same question? Yeah. Well, as a matter of fact, I have. Do we have to go into it? No. Okay. Not a great view of the city. It's a wilderness. What's your relationship to Hallam? I trained him. To do what? Trained him to survive... I trained him to kill. I trained a lot of people like him-- you know, the best of the best, shit like that. I pulled your file. You were never in the military. No. You just worked for them. Yeah. Like a contractor. Yeah. You don't like to talk about it, do you? No. My father was a... Army colonel. When my older brother was killed in Vietnam, he decided he wasn't going to lose another son to that particular war. End of story. Dad was a tracker before he joined the Army, and I learned what I do from him. What about Hallam? He's unusual. He can kill anybody... Without regret. Most of the people he killed never knew he was in the same room with them. How do you feel about that? Well, I don't know. I never had to kill anybody myself. I... I just taught people how. In many ways, Hallam is a fine warrior. After a tour in Kosovo, he was given another sensitive assignment... off the books. He went too far. A lot of innocent people lost their lives. Hallam's battle stress has become so deep, it is a part of his personality, and it's impossible to reverse. He's a killing machine. There is no way he can be indicted or tried in open court, or any court. He cannot be processed, interviewed, charged with a crime, or copped out as a psycho. His picture cannot appear in any newspaper. As far as the world is concerned, sir, Aaron Hallam doesn't exist. He's one of them. They'll handle it. You know why you're here, Aaron. You wandered off the range. It was way too messy, man. You're supposed to be precise. They weren't his family. They were soldiers, Dale. There was no backup, no way for me to get out. I was set up. That's bullshit. You fucked up. Your actions resulted in the injury and death of unarmed civilians. They had weapons. Well, you know, that's the problem... you can't tell the sharks from the guppies anymore. That's what they're using now? It's supposed to be painless. Of course, he'd never use it on himself... Release him, Aaron! Release him now! You flying to Vancouver? Yeah. Then a connecting flight? No. I drive. It takes about eight hours. That's right-- you don't like flying much. Must be worth it. It's a very special place. You ought to come up sometime. I think you'd like it. You wouldn't have to wear two guns all the time. I mean, your whole posture would... change. It's an open invitation. Is it painless, Dale? We need paramedics here! It's going to explode! See if you can help him. No, I can't! Somebody help that guy. Does anyone know what's going on? Is anyone on the way? Paramedic. Are you all right? Paramedic. Okay, call 911. I'm okay, I'm okay. My buddies are in there. Get 'em out, get 'em out! I'm okay. I'm okay. Okay? They're coming. Horrible, yeah. Get 'em out! Hello? Oh, shit! I can't hear you-- you're breaking up. Please do not leave your bags unattended. All unattended bags will be confiscated. All right, now, you go over there -Okay, yeah. -and I'll go over there, okay? All right. -Aah! -Come on, come on, come on. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ready or not, here I come. ...31 points. It was only the fourth loss in the last... May I have your attention please. This is the last call for flight 233... In other action, The 76ers 89 to 82. Jerry Stackhouse scored 29 points for the Pistons... Hey. ...capitalizing on 14 second half turnovers by the 76ers. Alan Iverson who's been hampered by injuries... ...all season long, remains on the bench, and it's still not known when he will return to the starting lineup. Raptors' star Vince Carter has also been nagged by injuries all season long, and can do very little to help his teammates... ...seems bound and determined... We have a breaking story. We're going to our correspondent, Jeff Gianola, Who is live outside the tunnel to Forest Park. Jeff? Ken, we have just arrived on the scene of a terrible accident outside the tunnel in Forest Park. This is some type of truck, some type of van that was transporting people. We can tell you there are... Arm... drop... ...recover. Arm... drop... recover. I will teach you how to kill... quickly, accurately, efficiently. It will become a reflex action. You will learn how to enter a combat zone and evaporate into shadow. You will learn how to survive... or you will not. Ready? Arm... heart... Ieg, leg... Iung. Reverse your grip. Bring your knife on the inside of his arm here, sever all the connective tissue, pulling his finger away from the trigger, and at the same time, coming around his left shoulder, grab the strap, choke him. Now come into his heart through the top of his sternum and bring him to the ground. Very good. Go. Arm, throat, heart, leg, leg, arm, lung. Good. Good. Into the thigh here, slice through that thigh and the femoral artery, into this thigh and that femoral artery. You will notice that this arm is in your way. It cannot hurt you. The only thing this arm can do to hurt you is block the lung puncture you're about to do. Push this arm over in front of his face, go into his lung. Now, arm, neck, heart, leg, leg, lung. One, two, three, four, five, six. One... two... three... power assist four... five... six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Make this cut a good power assist. You're looking for his backbone. Here we go. Go. There we go. Once again. "L.T.... "I don't think I can do this anymore. "The nightmares are getting worse. "I think I'm losing it, L.T. "I need to talk to you. "I don't know "if you've been getting my letters, L.T. "I need to hear from you or talk to you. "You've been like a father to me. Please write." Once you are able to kill mentally, the physical part will be easy. The difficult part... is learning how to turn it off. At this point, all we know for sure is that we have three confirmed fatalities. We don't know whether or not there were any other passengers inside this van when it crashed. Access is very limited. We have no new information from either the police or the FBl. However, the van appears to be a military-type vehicle, possibly the type of vehicle used to transport prisoners. We'll try to get some confirmation on that. Once again, information very sketchy. Rescue crew's still on the scene, along with FBl agents and technicians. We're getting no comment from the FBl agents on the scene. What happened? Hallam's loose. Hello, Irene. Oh, Aaron. You scared me. It's good to see you. I'm not listening to you no more, Aaron. Everything you told me was a lie. I've never lied to you, Irene. Where have you been the last six months? Doing stuff for the government. That's a lie, Aaron, that's a damn lie. Get out of here. I don't want to see you again. Aaron? Aaron, you're back! Hey, Loretta. Hey. It's so good to see you. I missed you so much. How's my big girl? Where have you been? Loretta, I need you to start your homework. Can I visit with Aaron some more? You can visit with him later. Are you staying for dinner, Aaron? Go do your homework. Don't think you're just going to step right back into our lives, Aaron. I understand, Irene. I don't even know what you do for a living. Did you look in my locker? How could I do that? You have four locks on the thing. What track is that? A squirrel. That's right. Where's the nex one? Um... Bring it down. Where's the nex one? I can't tell. Hold it flat. See? Every nine inches. That's the gallop pattern. Every nine inches. Oh, yeah, I see. What's this one? That's a raccoon. How come you never see any? Well, they hide to survive. Men don't respect animals anymore. They run them down or kill them any chance they get. I think that's sad. That's only Kitty. Here, Kitty. No, you don't want to bother him now. Why? He's hunting, too. Does he know we're here? Oh, he knows. How? He can sense it. She's so happy to see you. Sit down. What's this? You got to leave here. You got to get out of Portland. What are you talking about? You're in danger, Irene. Why am I in danger? You and Loretta. And they'll come here and burn this house down. What are you talking about, Aaron? House of Leader-- We got visual. Copy that. Stand by for intercept. All right, sweetie, you wait for me after school. I'm going to be there to pick you up, okay? All right. Is everything okay, Mommy? Everything's fine, honey. I love you. I love you, too. See you later, alligator. Bye. The Leader's approaching intercept, 6:.00. Roger that. We got her. Irene Kravitz? Agent Durrell. Is that your little girl? Loretta, is it? That's right. We'd like to talk to you. About what? Oh, it's just routine, really, but it'd be a lot easier if we talked inside. Uh, if you make us come back with a warrant, it won't be routine anymore. Going somewhere, Mrs. Kravitz? No, I'm just cleaning stuff up, trying to get organized. We're looking for a man named Aaron Hallam. Have you seen him? Not for a few months. But you know him. This have to do with his government work? When's the last time you saw him? I don't remember. A few months ago. He... sort of took off. That's the way he is. Is he here, Irene? What's this about? What's Aaron done? Please have a seat, Irene. Nobody said he's done anything. FBl wouldn't be here if he hadn't done something. When did you and Aaron meet? Eight months ago, maybe. Stayed here a while, then he just took off. He tell you where he was going? Mrs. Kravitz, is he still here? I said I ain't seen him in months. How many times do I have to say that? Excuse me, sir, where are you going? Irene, you wouldn't be doing him any good and you wouldn't be doing your daughter any good-- What do you know about my daughter?! You want someone around for her, I understand that, but you have to look out for her safety. You have to ask yourself, "Is this the right kind of guy to have around your daughter?" What has Aaron done? We just want to talk to him. Did he kill somebody? Come in. You care about these people here, Aaron? You're going to get them hurt. You here to sweep me, L.T.? You know I don't do that. How do I know that? They are coming for you. They've been coming for me for a long time, L.T. You have to answer for what you've done. I have to live with what I've done. You can say whatever you want. I don't trust you, L.T. If you cross this line, you better be ready to kill me. Don't move. Put your hands on your head and get on the floor. I said get on the floor, now. Get down. Get on the sidewalk! That's a silver star. That is a sketch that I made for a knife. It's addressed to you. "L.T., those guys you trained to come and kill me-- they're not soldiers, they're robots." We've got a positive ID at the river-front construction site. We're headed to that location, over. 10-9 that location. This is Agent in Charge Van Zandt, Agent Moret. This is site foreman, Hank Hooker. One of our guys saw him pull up over here near that tunnel entrance there. How many men work down there? Maybe three dozen. They're all coming up now. Wait, we need an exact count. I need a set of blueprints, all right? All right, this is an overview of the site. There's four major sections down there. He probably went down here in the red section, that's tunnels eight through 12. How far does this whole thing exend? About 12 square blocks, straight into downtown. We'll cover the red section. Only our people, Ted. All right, show me the other three entrances. He went in over there. There's three other entrances here. Make sure they're completely blocked off. Lock it down! I got it. FBI! Step away from the column with your hands up. Let me see your hands. 720, this is Number One. I need backup right now, red section, tunnel "A." Did you hear me? I said step away from the column now. Step away from the fucking column! About halfway. -Radio's dead. Shit. Jesus Christ. Bobby! Leave it in! Don't touch him! Don't touch him! Open his mouth. Keep pressure on the wound. Keep pressure on the wound. Command Post, this is Number Two. We have an agent down, sector red, sector red. Get me them EMTs now ASAP! Bobby... Bobby... Bobby, listen to me. Bobby, listen to me! Sorry, man. Hike! Hike! Hike! Number Two, Three-Charlie-One. Subject spotted on foot, eastbound, number two lane. Hawthorne Bridge. Close off both ends of the bridge. Two SWAT teams on the way. Over. Get everybody off the bridge. Leave that car! Excuse me. Get down! Let's keep this between us. Don't get in the way! Get everybody down on the floor. Get down, now! Down! Get down! He's on the tower! Target of opportunity! He's on the tower! Fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! Hold your fire! Captain, I need two or three of your officers on each bridge. Sweep the western sea wall, and shut down the bike paths. SWAT... I need recon teams on both sides of the river. Sniper units to cover each team's advance. You can take your people off the river. The currents are strong enough to carry him, and the kid swims like a fish. This is our show, Bonham. This is what we do best. How many people are you willing to lose? Excuse me? He will kill -as many of you as he can. -Bonham... You better decide now what's an acceptable body count. Knock it off! You want more dead bodies, that's what you're going to get if you let these guys declare war on my boy. I made him what he is and I can stop him. We've lost two of our people-- best agents I ever served with. Hallam belongs to us. If you see a wreck in there, let me know... We'll get a vehicle down there. If he's alive, he won't come in. Right. -Hallam! -Get on the ground! God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son." There's a man goin' "round takin" names And he decides Who to free and who to blame Everybody won't be treated all the same There'll be a golden ladder reaching down When the man comes around The hairs on your arm Will stand up At the terror in each sip and in each sup Will you partake of that last offered cup Or disappear into the potter's ground When the man comes around? Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers One hundred million angels singin' Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum Voices callin', voices cryin' Some are born and some are dyin' It's Alpha and Omega's Kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks The whirlwind is in the thorn tree It's hard for thee to kick against the priest Till Armageddon, no Shalam, no Shalom Then the father hen will call his chickens home The wise men will bow down before the throne And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns When the man comes around Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still Listen to the words long written down When the man comes around Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers One hundred million angels singin' Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettle drum Voices callin', voices cryin' Some are born and some are dyin' It's Alpha and Omega's Kingdom come And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree The virgins are all trimming their wicks The whirlwind is in the thorn tree It's hard for thee to kick against the priest In measured hundredweight and penny pound When the man comes around.
