We are living in a world of high strangeness. The fact is, all this activity started happening at a certain definite point in our history. Before the early '50s, there's nothing. Then it all began. The sightings, the signals... too many to deny. So you have to ask yourself, "What specific event caused this sudden uptick in alien visitation after thousands of years of silence?" It was our atomic energy. They detected it. I mean, that many megatons? How couldn't they? And then, they followed it here. What do they want? Are they studying us? Warning us? Harvesting us? We don't know, but the fact is they're here. They are here now, and they are not going away. Mercy, six-two actual. We've lost visual contact. Say position. Over. Roger, six-two. Stand by. Chopper's lost us. I think we took a wrong turn. Can't see a damn thing out here. Friday, April 13th. Huh... My last day alive... maybe. What does that matter when so many have died before me? They said she was beautiful. I suppose she was. The part of her that was human, anyway. And the part that wasn't, what about that? Did the men she killed understand, in some final flash before dying, what she really was? Cold. Indifferent. Inhuman. Insatiable. And terrifyingly wonderful. And what about the civilization that beamed her DNA code through space? They knew we'd use it. Knew we'd mix it with our own genes. But did they know the monster that would result? Twice she was built. Twice she brought destruction. And now it's my turn to take Eve's body. Take her dying DNA and somehow create something better. More pure. Only then will we understand why she was sent. Only then. Slow down. Easy. She's dead. I don't think she cares at this point. You up from the Reserves or something? Something like that. - Wait. - What? The road. We're supposed to be on a gravel road. The one we passed back there. Pull over, man. I told you to stay on the road! Did you hear me? I said, pull over. Six-two, this is Mercy. Put down the radio. Now. - I said, put it down now! - Okay! Okay! Chill out! What are you, back from Iraq or something? Shut up. Now, get out. Jesus fucking Christ! Anybody! This is Mercy! Cargo's alive! Repeat, the cargo is alive... Now, get out, as I told you. What the hell are you doin'? Mercy six-two, come in. Do you read me? Over. Do you read me? Over? - Nothing. - Find them. Are you... Eve. I got him. 16 miles east-southeast. Looks like they're not moving. Still no contact? Mercy six-two, come in. Come in. Do you read me? Over. Negative. Send a ground team in there to meet us. Six-two ground. Six-two ground. This is six-two actual. Rendezvous, Mercy. Coordinates, 87 Foxtrot. Over. Can't see anyone down there. Let's pay 'em a visit. - Who's he? - Specialist Robert Kelly. - Who else was here? - Just the driver. - Where's his body? - No idea, sir. I want a full autopsy. Check every inch of this ambulance and destroy it. - And find that driver. - Yes, sir. Good afternoon, sir. This monster's been sucking in natural gas and spewing out electricity for over 50 years. Now, you might be wondering why we still need this in the 21st century. After all, it's loud, expensive, inefficient, temperamental, and it smells terrible. And it's the best way we have of keeping the lights on. But, if you follow me, I'm gonna show you how we're gonna put it out of business. Come on upstairs. Come on in, folks. Just gather around here. - How's it going, guys? - Okay, Dean. Warning... Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Tokamak. You're looking at a prototype fusion reactor. The university cut a deal with the city to build this down here. Now, we're just in the experimental stages, but soon... everything from cars and cell phones to washing machines, and even spacecraft, will be powered with clean, limitless fusion energy, all courtesy of the atom. - How does it work? - Glad you asked. - Glen, you wanna fire this thing up? - Sure. We take hydrogen and deuterium, put them together inside the reactor, and then heat the mixture to 10 million degrees. We then try to get the two elements to combine or fuse, which produces a staggering amount of energy. Basically, it's how the sun works. So you're telling us inside that thing, it's as hot as the sun. - Yeah. - Isn't that dangerous? Yes, it is. Very. But don't worry. Inside the Tokamak are a series of magnets powered by the plant here. The magnets keep the super-hot plasma contained at all times. Positive air-flow keeps the room pressurized, and the walls here are six feet thick, which is two feet thicker than the walls in the pyramids of Giza. That's a little trivia for you. Now, I'd love to be able to fire this thing up myself and show you, but, unfortunately, there's only one guy who can do that, and that's the head of the department, with his own personal access key. And now, for the highlight. On Sublevel C is the plant cafeteria, where I understand the grilled cheese is excellent, but the tuna fish sandwich is not. I'd love to join you, but I gotta get back to class. So, anyway, thank you very much. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you very much. - No problem. Thanks a lot. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Behold, the T-4 bacteriophage virus... nature's most elegant killing machine. Look at it. It's beautiful, isn't it? Invading our living cells, it has killed unabated since the beginning of time. Who made it? Where did it come from? What immortal hand or eye framed this dreadful symmetry? You know what, just between us, I think... Who are you? - I'm Dean. - Dean? Of what? Leisure studies? No, Dean's my name. - Oh... An atrocious one. - Sorry, sir? I don't even think you're in this class. - Yes, I am. - I think not. Because if you were Dean, you obviously would have arrived on time along with the rest of your classmates. Won't happen again, sir. As I was saying, between us, I think we made these viruses, you and I. They're our own renegade microbes, escaped from our cells, evolving, mutating, they become our curse, our punishment. Multiplying our sorrows... the perfect predator. It's hardly perfect. What was that? - Nothing. - No, no, no. Repeat your comment. Well, it's just that you said that viruses are perfect, but they're not. For one thing, they can't reproduce on their own, and that's their Achilles' heel right there. Without a host mechanism, they're just slowly dying proteins. It seems we have a future CDC administrator among us. I don't get it. On level four of the Center for Disease Control, there are preserved in frozen nitrogen the world's last remaining strains of smallpox... strains which are now scheduled for destruction. Rendered extinct. Like the dodo bird, dinosaur... ...and I guess that pleases you, right? Who are you to judge which species lives or dies? What? What the hell was that? - Specist. - Specist? Someone who's prejudiced against other species. Yeah, I know what it is, but of all the things I've been called... Did you get beat up on the playground a lot? Shut up. - Got any change? - Yeah. Word. Come on, man. I will buy you something nice out of the vending machines. - Thanks. - Uh-huh. It's 'cause I like you. Dean! Can I have a word? - Shit. - I gotta go, dude. I got an online auction, you know? Yes, Dr. Turner? As you know, being your department head, it's my responsibility to review your funding. I must say I'm concerned with what I've seen. - Concerned? - You're all over the place! Physics, biochemistry, bioengineering... too many interests, too few results. Especially for graduate-level work. Sir, lately the Tokamak's been giving us a very... Oh, forget it. The Tokamak's history. - Fusion power's a pipe dream! - What? We're ending our contract on it by the end of the month. So you either find yourself an approved project overseen by a professor... or you forfeit your scholarship next semester. Is that clear? Wait, wait, wait. You're cutting the funding? You can't cut the funding! I can do anything I want. No, sir, just listen to me for one minute! Asshole! Cat? Cat? Cat... I'm hungry- How did you get out of the lab? I'm hungry! I'd be, too, if I grew six inches a day. - Lobster. - What? They play it every hour. Red Lobster. For the seafood lover in you. What else did you learn from television today? No, no, no. If you eat upstairs, use silverware, all right? This is a fork. This is a knife. But with lobster, you take the fork and you stick it in there like that, and you pull it down and you... pull. - Sara. - Excuse me? You don't have a name. Sara. Yes. Sara. Before you fall asleep, I want you to promise me something. I won't lock you in here anymore if you promise not to leave this house. Ever. Because the outside world is dangerous for you. Dangerous? Sara, you're gonna grow up very fast. Your childhood... lasts only days, not years. See, you were the third generation of something very special. An alien species... ...created with a new sequence of DNA, received in a transmission from deep space. That's right. Some of my colleagues tried to study your kind. Things ended badly. I won't make those same mistakes. I just want to protect you... because... I think there's a message, a very important message, inside you... a reason why you're here. Someday, you'll tell me what it is... in your own time. Are there others like me? Not like you. You're unique... and the most important thing in my life. I wouldn't worry. She won't be giving you any more trouble. Signature? Wait a minute. Wait just a minute. This can't be right. Pregnant? She was. Gave birth, too, from the looks of it. The yellow copy's yours. I just need the top copy for my records. No records. This never happened. And burn the body. Now. Yes, sir. Abbot? Dr. Turner here. I've been looking everywhere for you. That report to the foundation... I'll need to account for how you've been using their funds. Why? If line items are too much trouble, then just give me a general... Damn! Look, Dr. Turner, I really don't have any time for... Dr. Abbot. Yes? Tell me, where is it? Where's what? Who are you? Where is it? Look. Listen, I don't know what you're talking about, or who you are... You can either leave now, or I'm gonna call security. There is no... security. Hang on. I'm getting help. You don't... recognize me, do you? No. The ambulance... that night... in the woods. Remember? You're the boy. A half-breed. How did you get in that...? Where did you...? I escaped... into the world. How did you find me? Things will go much... easier for you if you tell me where it is. You're having respiratory failure. Look, until I know what's going on, I can't help you, all right? Let me draw some blood. Some others are sick, too. - Others? - Half-breeds. Those like me. I do see some foreign structures here, but none of it's viral. If I didn't know better, I'd say it was just pollen. It is pollen. And some dust particles, too... very common in the bloodstream. Nothing that should make you this sick. Antihistamines should stabilize you. Should clear it up. Are the others the same way? Yes... sore throat, skin rash, and no explanation. You shouldn't... you shouldn't be sick like this. Take me to it... now! Professor? You wanted to see me? Yeah. I wanted to see you. What happened to you? Did you pull an all-nighter? Something like that. I heard Turner pulled the funding on your project. - Yeah. - Sorry. Thanks. Dean, I think I can help. There's something I want to show you. Go on in. - Oh, shit. - Take a closer look. What the hell is this? I was hoping you could tell me. I've never seen anything like it. It's definitely organic. All right, where did this come from? It's a half-breed. The result of some unfortunate coupling between human and alien DNA. Its flawed genes made it vulnerable to common diseases. As a result, they're all a doomed species. What's more, they know it. If this thing could track me down for help, we can only assume others will be coming, too. Possibly even more desperate and dangerous. Wait. You're not planning on just dissecting this, are you? No. Then what? Something profound. Something that will assure my place in the pantheon of science. Yours, too, of course. I'm talking about the engineering of a disease-resistant, perfect alien species. How? First, we cut up our friend, then we strip out the disease-prone human DNA... and create a pure strain of alien nucleic acids. All those aging mediocrities in the genetics community pinning awards on each other for sequencing DNA. Sequencing it! What good is it if you don't do anything with it? Even if you've got a pure strain, you'd still have to mate it with something, right? You're getting the idea. Let's get this thing out of here. Quietly... and in pieces. Garbage bags in the cupboard. I knew it. So just what are we working on? Oh! Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I... I... I... Excuse the intrusion. I... I didn't mean to interrupt. - I just came to see Abbot. - He's not home. Well, I'll come back another time. Would you like to come inside? Why don't you look at me? Aren't I attractive? You are by any standard... perfect. Are you Abbot's girlfriend? Housekeeper? Just a friend. Just friends. No need to use names. Your lack of inhibition is truly inspiring. Careful! Brooks Brothers! Am I asleep? Am I awake? Who the hell cares? That's enough. You can leave. Excuse me? Go! Shut the door on your way out. Not so fast. Moments like these don't happen every day. I think we should go for it. No! It's not polite to be a prick tease! Don't you know that? Here. Let's get inside. What is that? - It's happened. - What's happened? - Sara, where are you? - What happened? Sara, where are you? Holy shit! What the hell happened? What the hell was he doing here? Impressive. She's already quite powerful. What are you doing? Here. His access card might come in handy sometime. No, no, just leave him. We gotta call the police. - I don't think so. - You don't think so? There's a dead man on your bedroom floor, Professor! Turner had it coming for years now. That's crazy! You're not thinking about reporting this, are you? - Yeah! - Dean, it's not murder. - She was just following instinct. - Instinct?! Listen, Professor, this whole situation has gotten way out of control. We gotta call the police immediately. Now, Dean, you really think the police are gonna believe you when you tell them an alien species killed the head of your department? If anything, they'll take a closer look at you, who recently had a very heated disagreement with the victim over your funding... which he cut. That's insane. Dean! Dean, I need your help. Sara's producing eggs now. We can build something, something amazing. You walk away now, it's back to beakers and Bunsen burners. I like beakers and Bunsen burners. You're upset, I know. This part of it isn't pleasant. - It's in the name of science, Dean. - In the name of science?! Come on. You gotta give me something better than that! The end result, the end result. The outcome. Don't ever lose sight of what that all will mean, Dean. I want shared credit. What? My name next to yours on everything we do. Ag reed. I was sure you'd turn that down. What, and give you a graceful way out? Truth is, you don't want a way out. Not after what you've seen. Give me Turner's keys. I'll get rid of the car. Easy. Easy. - Now we gotta find Sara. - How? You don't even know what she looks like at this age. No, no. I'll know her when I see her. She could be anywhere. No, she's close by. It's Saturday night... in a college town. Mating opportunities everywhere. Oh! Whoo! Damn, baby! Oh! All right, my turn. I always wanted a girl who could kick my ass. How about putting a little tongue on that? You don't want the tongue. Agh! She's not here. What if she doesn't come back? - She will. - How do you know? We've accepted her, provided her with food and shelter. You look beat. Get some sleep. Thanks. Lent day. Dear, are you all right? Honey, you must be freezing. You got a name? I'm Colleen. Come on, let me give you a ride home. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Don't feel bad. There really aren't any good men in the world. So what do you do? Sometimes, you settle for less. Other times, you curl up in bed with a book and a Dove bar. Oh, I know. I'm a huge sci-fi geek. All that Roswell stuff? It's real. I'm going to a convention next month on government conspiracies. I even know how to defend myself against alien abduction. - You do? - Oh, believe me. We are living in a world of high strangeness. Turn here! - I thought you said... - Turn! Fine. Stop! Sweetie, there's nothing out here. What... Where are you going? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What, are you crazy? What are you doing running? What are you doing? Oh, my God! Oh, no. Oh, my God. God... Oh, my God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Start! Start! Start! Okay, okay! That's it! Okay! Okay! Just go! Somebody help me! Asshole. Wakey, wakey, sunshine. What time is it? - So what's her name? - Who? Whoever you were out with till 3:00 last night. It was nobody. - Where are you going? - Got to go to class. On Sunday? Hmm. Hello? Hey, listen, sorry I'm late. My alarm clock didn't go off. Hello? - Who are you? - I'm Dean. - You must be Sara. - How do you know my name? Because I'm working for Abbot. Please let me go. Please. You're late. Again! Sorry. I just met Sara. She's friendly. It's better to stay away from her as much as you can. No reason for you two to have any unnecessary interactions. And another thing. She's not to be told what we're doing down here, all right? As far as she knows, we're just observing and studying her. The half-breed's immune system is shredded. Lungs clogged with every imaginable toxin. All of them will end up like this, I'd wager. - The same thing happen to Sara? - No, no, no. Her superior DNA should keep her quite healthy. Let me bring you up to speed. From Project Athena, using Fitch's files, I've done a comparative DNA analysis of the three generations of alien species. Sil... the original. Created with equal amounts human and alien DNA. It's not a bad effort, really. This, of course, is Eve... genetic duplicate of the original. Blood chemistry was highly toxic in both subjects. Behavior unpredictable, often aggressive. Disease-free. Slightly susceptible to hydrochlorine solutions. Half-breeds... first life forms created naturally, outside the lab. Mother was human, father was an astronaut infected by the alien strain... resulting in unstable offspring riddled with disease. Evolutionary mistakes with no defense against infection. Now we have perfection. Or close to it. With a half-human mother, Sara still has traces of our DNA, but she is the purest species yet. NOTE... I'm going out now. Don't try to stop me. Have I stood in your way, Sara? This is your home, not a prison. We're your friends. Do as you like. Oh... You're not just gonna let her go out? Why not? What about secrecy? What about harvesting the eggs? - That's the plan, right? - Certainly. Well, anything could happen to her out there. What if she doesn't come back? She came back last night, didn't she? Sara has eliminated our species as potential partners. As a purer strain, she has no genetic partner. Plainly put, the girl can't get laid. Can you give me a hand? Hey, you know this Project Athena? Seems this guy, Dr. Fitch, already tried growing a creature from its own DNA. The thing nearly destroyed the isolation chamber before they incinerated it. I have no intention of repeating Dr. Fitch's failures. Obviously, pure alien DNA is too volatile on its own. Once we inject it into Sara's eggs, though, her human chromosome should temper the mixture. What about Sara? How's she gonna feel about this? Sara doesn't have any feelings. Let's get on with this. We have a lot to do. - May I help you? - I need a room. Yes, sir. Please sign here. - Something's wrong. - Nothing's wrong. There's something wrong with you. - A sickness... - I'm fine. You're not fine! You're dying! Don't turn your back on us! Hi. Sara, wait. I wanted to show you something, if it's all right. Why don't you sit down? What is this? It's chess. It's a game. It's fun. This is the king, and it's the most valuable piece, but it's also the most vulnerable. And there's other pieces, and they all move. That's the rule book, but it's long and boring. - It's easier if I just show you. - Start. - What? - White moves first. All right. You've played before. No. Wait, you don't mean just by picking up that book, you could... That's right. You're kidding, right? Wow. Checkmate. How can you do that? I have to sleep now. Okay... Listen... maybe we could, you know, sometime... Agh! Yo. What happened to your hand? It was a Bunsen burner. Seen the departmental website today? - Amazing! - What about it? "Hi, my name's Amelia, and I am looking for anyone in an accredited biochemistry program who's recently done work in advanced DNA electroporation." Jesus, look at her! Those eyes, man. Those bedroom eyes, man. Come on, she can't look like that and be a biochemist. Who cares what she is? What are you doing? I gotta see just how crazy this chick is. You're an idiot. Dude, dude! There's already an answer. Hi. This is Amelia. Get out your credit card. She's definitely crazy... I'm in love. Before we speak directly, I need to ask you a few questions. Have you done any unusual lab work in protoplastic cell suspension? Specifically, any kind of transmembrane conductivity and permeability diffusion? I'm looking for a man who has measured pore coefficients greater than 10e minus 16 meters squared per second. If you're that man, please submit some sample data in the response body of an e-mail to me. If I like what you write, we can meet. I promise you won't be disappointed. Okay... that's annoying. Turn your computer off. Just turn it off. Hey! What's your problem?! You've been acting squirrelly for clays now... sneaking around, disappearing. What's up? Nothing. Sir, Echelon picked this up during a morning sweep. - What is it? - Mass e-mail. Went out to servers at every biochem program in North America. The terminology is highly specialized. Certain key words resonate exactly with Project Athena. - Athena... - Wasn't that shut down? - I want this girl found. - Yes, sir. You know, I've been meaning to tell you. I think it's a big mistake for you to start having feelings for Sara. Feelings? - She's just gonna break your heart. - Who said I had feelings for her? And I understand the temptation, of course. I don't have feelings for her. Listen, I know she's not attracted to humans, all right? Everything she does is only in her own biological interest. I know this. And listen. Do me a favor. I'll steal equipment, I'll dissect aliens, I'll even bury bodies. Just don't give me any more dating advice. - Please. - Okay. Hey. No one knows anything about this, right? Of course not. Ah, there you are. We need to take another blood sample. You know the drill. You look tense. And your blood pressure's... ...way up. What's wrong? I'd prefer it if Dean took my blood. Dean? Very well. This won't take long. What the hell is that?! Must be another half-breed. What are you doing? I equipped the lab with a fail-safe. Hydrochloride gas. But it's toxic to Sara, too! Come on, we gotta get her! No! Stay! What about the project? You can't just let her die! It's already in here! - You already harvested her eggs? - The first night of her maturity. She never knew. Did it under anesthesia while she slept. That's why you let her go out. Oh, come on, look! He's raping her! No, Dean! No! Damn it! Go! Go! Go! Go! Get Sara! So! So! So! Abbot! Abbot! Ah... All right, listen to me. Listen to me, all right? You're gonna be okay, all right? You're gonna be okay! I doubt it. Come on. Absurd... can't possibly end like this. No, it's not, okay? I'm gonna go to the E.R. Come on! I'm going to the E.R. Right now! Come on! The half-breeds... they'll keep coming. More and more! Dangerous! The eggs! Do it, Dean... create the new species. Do it... Your life's in danger. I don't understand. You see that thing there? That contains your eggs. Alien ova, you understand? The half-breeds need it so they can create a viable continuation of their line. And Abbot wanted it... Abbot wanted it so he could create an even purer strain, so they'd give him the Nobel prize. But I think we should just put an end to this whole little Garden of Eden right now. What about me? Sara, you could have a lifespan of 400 years, for all I know. And if I don't reproduce, the threat to your own species ends with me? That's right. But with the DNA you've collected, you can create more like me. Sara, listen to me. Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should. Well, I guess this is it, Doctor. Ammonium nitrate and perchloric acid. Hope you'd approve. Sara? Sara, are you in here? Sara. We sh... we shouldn't do this. Don't you want me, Dean? Yeah, of course I do, but... why do you want me? I just do. You're not attracted to humans. You want something. Abbot's work was important. The species must continue. It's up to you. Why don't you just think of it as a simple exchange of services? Fuck it. I can't. It's up to you, Dean. Hey, what's up? - Did you hear about Abbot? - What about Abbot? He's gone, dude... went missing. Just like Dr. Turner. That's two profs in one semester. I wonder if there's some kind of specialized serial killer out there. So, anyway... ...I heard back from Amelia. - Amelia? - Yeah. The honey on the internet? The one who wanted the information on electroporation. - You got in touch with her? - Yeah. She liked the data. What data? Something you wanna tell me? What are you talking about, Hastings? - You left your notebook here one day. - You went through my shit? - Jesus, man! Why did you do that?! - It's genetically impossible! So what the hell is it? Look, I just... I can't tell you right now, all right? I'm sorry. She said the data was perfect. And then she starts in with all kinds of other questions. Who was I? Where did I get it? Did I have any contact with alien life? At that point, I'm like, "All right, the chick really is crazy." Wait a minute. She has your e-mail address. - So? - So she can find us! Us? So what? She's just some harmless crazy chick! Right? What'll it be? This is a gas station, right? Fill it up. Are you sure you don't need something else? Yeah. Tell me where I can pee. There's a women's room around the back. Check the oil, too... Unless that's too hard for you. - Nice ride. - Got that right. There's no soap in here. Maybe you should file a complaint. Maybe you should get out of here. Maybe I should teach you some manners. Maybe you should. - Come on. - All right. Jesus! Stop! You're goddamn killing me! What do you say we join the party, huh? Oh, shit! - Yeah! - Hell, yeah! Cobb? Cobb, you okay? Done worn him out. Cobb? I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm Amelia. You must be Hastings. Where can I go and freshen up? So, you want a drink or something? So... how was your trip? - Where's your lab? - Lab? I wanna see it. I wanna see everything. And after that, you'll get your reward. - You sure you don't wanna...? - Tell me something. Where did you get your specimen from, anyway? We never talked about that. - Specimen? - Something wrong? No. Who else lives here? No one. Just me. Okay... look... you know, it was all a joke? The data I sent you was fake. - I made it up. - You didn't make up that data. Now, why don't you just tell me where you got it from? I told you. I made it up. Hastings. It seems you haven't been completely honest with me. And from now on, that's gonna change. I came here to get something from you, and you are gonna give it to me. Trust me, you're much better off making me happy than making me mad. Hey! Hey! We gotta get out of the hallway! - Stop! Stop! - We gotta get out of the hallway! - Come on! - No! Oh, shit! Get in, Dean. It seems we still have a problem with Project Athena. Who are you? How do you know my name? What do they want? These things? Why kidnap your roommate? I can't be sure. My best guess is that they need someone with scientific knowledge to help them bioengineer a new strain of species. - A new species? - Yeah. 'Cause the current one's about to go extinct. And if they can't get my help, they'll get my horny roommate to do it. - We can't let 'em breed. - Who'd you say you worked for? I didn't. Look, we've been down this road before... twice. The two previous operations of containment resulted in a $700 million bill from the U.S. Army and a six-week investigation by Congress. I have neither the budget nor the stomach to go through that again. Besides, when I think of those operations, the word "overkill" comes to mind. So you work for the government. No, I'm a limousine driver. Unfortunately, the current administration has much less of an appetite for science fiction, shall we say? So I'm not here in an official capacity, and we won't be taking care of this in an official capacity. What are you gonna do? You and I are taking care of this in an unofficial capacity. She's probably found Sara and brought Hastings back to Abbot's lab. All the equipment's there for the DNA cloning. Blazing in won't do us any good. We need to figure out a weakness on Sara. You can hack into Abbot's database, right? - Yeah, I think so. - Good. Do it. Yes, sir. Have you made any progress yet? It's confusing, all this stuff. Maybe it's a question of focus. Now, get on with it. Do you intend to kill him? So what if he dies? There's a college campus here. I can find another scientist. What are you looking at? Abbot made physiology schematics of the aliens. - We're running out of time. - I know. Any weaknesses? Well, the half-breeds have failing immune systems, so we should be able to kill Amelia with any common contaminant. What kind of contaminant? Hydrochlorine gas. Should produce a fatal infection. That won't work on Sara. How the hell are we gonna kill her? - Where do you think you're going? - This isn't my problem. Look at me! You might be fine now. What about later? You're our only hope. It's up to you now. Your ova cells look okay. You can see on that monitor right there. I should be able to inject the DNA directly into it. What happens after that? We'll have to grow it to maturity in a solution of carbon-based molecules... a membrane bag, basically. Once embryo growth has started, we just keep increasing the container size until it's developed enough to breathe air. Go ahead. - What are you waiting for? - Please... don't make me do this. Do it. - They should be coming out soon. - This better work. He's got my eggs! There he is. Hey, you okay? So... how's things? - Wonderful. Is this them? - Yeah, the DNA and ova cells. All right, we got the container. They'll follow that. - Who's this guy? - My driver. Dude, you're right. I shouldn't have sent that e-mail. Just get in. Hey! Hold it right there! - I'm gonna need some time! - Give me the eggs! Listen, why don't I just head on home? Let's go! You're with me! This way! Warning! Containment door closing. Dr. Turner. Access granted. Reload password. Containment door closed. Tokamak depressurizing. Christ. It's the eggs. - She's following the eggs. - Exactly. That's the plan. Let's go! She's buying it. Where in the hell's Dean? He should be here! Dean! Take me to the control room. Up here! Warning! Tokamak depressurizing. What are you guys up to, anyway? Later. - The remote's gone! - What? He's taking control of the reactor. It's activated! He's lowering the pressure in the reactor room. You better know what you're doing, Dean. Who's in here? Hold it right there! Don't move! What? Something wrong with my face? One last thing. Warning! Tokamak depressurizing. - He's powering down the magnets! - Just stick to the plan, Dean. This thing's gonna blow! What are you talking about? This was not part of the plan! - Close the shaft, Dean. - Why? If he doesn't secure the shaft, the explosion will release into the atmosphere, taking all of us with it! What? Damn it, Dean, close down the shaft! Warning! Magnetic Failure. Now! Now! Now! Close the fucking shaft, Dean! - Magnetic... - Oh, shit! Sara, no! Oh, shit! Hold on! Hey, come on! I think it's over. Containment door secured. Magnets repowering. I guess he closed the shaft. Yeah. Let's go find Dean! Come on! Let's go! We're still trying to understand the cause of the explosion. The experimental reactor was located deep inside this power plant. The access records show that a man named Dr. Nicholas Turner was using the system at the time of the blast. If he survived it, we'd certainly like to talk to him. - You're awake! - Yeah. - How ya feeling? - Not bad. Doc says you're gonna be okay. Yeah. Oh, I brought your favorite dirty magazine. Did you see Wasach on TV? Yeah... said you should come see him sometime in Washington when you're feeling better. - Really? - It's all cool. Turner's taking the rap. He even thanked us on behalf of the government. Hey, listen, man, about this whole thing... I'm sorry. - I'm hungry. You hungry? - Yeah, sure. No. Oh, no. No! Dean! Hey! - What are you...? - What's up? What the hell is going on here? I'm just doing a little clean-up. No, I mean upstairs! There's... - Oh, Christ. - All right, just relax. There's something I haven't told you. Help! Sara! Come on! - You said it was over. - It is over. She's got what she wants now. What she... What did you do? There was still some remnants of the half-breed DNA, so I stripped away the damaging human strains and created him. You see, Abbot's mistake was relying on Sara's eggs. After all, she couldn't mate with anything that was from her own genetic material. So I created another one, solely from the other DNA. It's two separate lines. Well, you're on your own now, so... be careful. Sara, wait. That night on the catwalk, you saved my life, but your eggs were already gone. You had no more use for me. Why'd you do it? Maybe you'll find the answer to that someday. Well, that's just great. We go through all that, and in the end, you give her a goddamn boyfriend. Nobody should be alone, man. You've just sentenced the world to destruction, my friend. You realize once those two start mating... I didn't say he was fertile, did I? - You mean, you made him... - Sterile. I tweaked the chromosomes before I even started. What happens once they figure out he's sterile? They might not take too kindly to that. I don't know. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast. It's my turn, anyway.
