She read all my songs. She has become a good friend of mine. Okay, our today's canteen bill has been taken care of. Why? Did you father send the money early today?

Okay, our expenses for an hour or two has been taken care of. Yes. Just a second. l will be right back. What happened to the Comedy Circus? Surinder went home. They are calling him. By the way, shall we go and find out where he is? Let's go. Param, that's great. l mean it's very nice. l feel like casting your pen and hand in gold. So that l cannot neither move my hand nor use the pen. You always say the wrong thing. Param, what is this? This mug has the other boys names along with yours. Hey, he is busy over here. Meher, that's because whenever my friends... ...are away from me, l should miss them. My friends are my courage. Courage! He is shooting AK47 at us and calling us his courage. Then l am not your friend. Girl, l was talking about my buddies. Okay. Then l am your buddy. Okay. So, to be my buddy repeat this three times. l accept... - l accept... - You... Calm down. l accept... - l accept... l accept... - l accept... So Ms. Meher, now you are my friend for life. Now l will recite a poem for my new friend. Beautiful face, pink lips. They make me restless. They make me intoxicated. Wonderful. - Wonderful. Wonderful, sir. Wonderful. - Wonderful. Did you hear our friend's poem? lt goes straight to the heart. Why are you telling me? Did l ask you? Ms. Meher, what is a friend's friend called? Simple. A friend. So, hence proved. According to the theorem, l am also your friend. Here you go then. Ms. Meher, let's shake hands. Prem. My name is Prem. Meher. My name is Meher. Whatever l touch creates music. Really? Tunes reside in my breath. Really? Music is in my soul. And l am made up of tunes. Really? What l say becomes a song. And whenever l open my eyes... l don't know about your eyes... ...but if you keep crushing my hand... ...then l will surely yell. You didn't see this. Did you see? Give me my cup. My cup! His condition is much better. l think we don't need to keep him in the lCU any longer. We will soon shift him to another ward. Param. Param. Param. Param, look... Param. Open your eyes and look. Meher is here to see you. Param, open your eyes. Look...look, Param, Meher is here to see you. Param, open your eyes. Param. Param. Oh no. Param. Param. Look what is happening. Fearing you...fearing you my eyes started peeing, Param. Param. Get up, Param. Get up, Param. Everyday in my college... l don't know why. l wish if once she send me... Send me hi. Send me hi. But she doesn't even look at me. l think she is shy. l wish if once she send me... Send me hi. Every time l sleep on my bed. l find my angel in my dreams alive. But then l wake up in the morning... Then l think. That was that a dream or was she really there. Damsel, your love has made me crazy. l feel l don't belong to this world anymore. ls this love? What is this love? Come and have a look at my state. Every time l sleep on my bed. l find my angel in my dreams alive. Then l wake up in the morning and think... Was that a dream or was she really there. Because she is my angel. Handsome, your love has made me crazy. l feel l don't belong to this world anymore. ls this love? Yes, this is love. l am in the same state you are in. Scoundrels. l had just reached closer to Meher. You pulled the ladder. l was romancing with Meher. Prem, don't fly too high. The higher you fly the more hurt you will be someday. Yes, uncle. Grapes are sour. lt is not about that, Prem. We are getting calls from our families. And what are we doing for our band Pure Punjabis. Nothing at all. We will do something. lt has hardly been some time since we joined college. When will you do it? You are wasting your time on Meher. Look, Prem, she is just a good friend of ours. Don't try to stretch that relationship. Don't think of a future. What if she comes to know? What do you mean? What will Meher find out? Param is right, Prem. Things have not gone far. lf Meher finds out that we have lied to our parents... ...have come to Arts college instead of medical... ...by deceitfully making them sign the forms... ...then what will she think? And what about Satyawadi? lf this comes out, he will never tolerate this lie. Get this straight. l don't care if they find out. We are not committing a crime. You all are rusticated from my college. For breaking my faith, your parents' faith... ...and the discipline of this institution. Sir, we agree that we made a mistake. We lied. But, sir, what we did isn't such a big crime... ...for which you are giving us such a big punishment. Sir... Our lives will get ruined, sir. Mister, you ruined your life the day... ...you made your parents deceitfully sign... ...Arts college form instead of Medical college. This is a crime. That too an unpardonable one. To fool parents who are spending their hard earned money... ...on you is a crime. And there is no place for cheats in Satyawadi's world. Forgive me, sir. You shouldn't give so much freedom to your children... ...that you lose control over them. My name is Kabir Satyawadi. There can be only one band in this college. Kabir's. Others will have to meet dust. Tell this to your romantic friend, Prem. Forget Meher, if he even thinks about Meher's shadow... ...then this is just a preview. There is more to come. Give it to me, father. l will turn the direction of the water flow. Ramu. - Yes, sir. Water is here only for limited period of time. lf the flow isn't changed on time, all the harvest will be ruined. He has already ruined it. Son, you should take care of the harvest. Okay, sir. l already owe a lot. What have you thought about Raj? Where do you want to get him admitted? l thought that if you could extend your leave for 2-3 days... Jasleen, if l, too, start disobeying my orders... then there won't be any difference left between me and your Raj. And your son doesn't need admission in a medical college... ...he needs a medical checkup. Father... Jasleen, l don't have time to waste. lt is time for me to leave. l am make a move. But please, at least let me... Complete... So, mister, start practising in the ground from today itself. l will make you join the army. You couldn't become a doctor. You might as well become a constable. Constable's father, lG Hardeep Singh. You doubted my capability... ...that you started doing such things? Perhaps... Our love has spoilt you. You deceitfully made me sign it. Vijay's mother. - Yes. Start giving him a tiffin from tomorrow. He will come with me. He should know... what being a clerk means. So what... ...if l made him sign it to be an artist instead of a doctor? l, too, have a life of my own. Your life. And you wish to start it with a lie. Yes. As if you would have agreed if l would have told the truth. Fine, then you will go to the factory from tomorrow. l wanted to educate you, make you a doctor... ...and open a big hospital for you. You were anyway not going to serve the people by opening a hospital. You were going to exploit people, Mr. Mittal. So according to you doctors exploit people? No one make his child a doctor... ...thinking that he will make him proud one day. Everyone can see the money they will get in the future. And you? You, too, have the same dream. l won't let my dream die. One day our Pure Punjab Band will be famous across the world. And that day...you will hold your head high and say... ...Yes. Yes, my son, Prem made the right decision. Stop your nonsense. You will handle the Focal Point factory from tomorrow. That's it. Shall we leave, Vijay? - Yes, father. Galti. Galti. Galti. Galti. - Father is here. Damn you. - Yes. l bought a new CD player just day before yesterday. You ruined that as well, scoundrel. - What do l do? You didn't let me do what l wanted to do. l wanted to be an engineer. You ruined my career. Galti. No. lt's Galti. Galti. Galti. Yes. Galti. - Yes. You cannot even talk properly. And you want to be an engineer. - Hear that. You don't need to speak properly to be an engineer. You need brains. My enemy. Stop. - Yes. You didn't become an engineer. - Yes. And yet you are making us suffer a loss. lf you would have become an engineer... ...then l wonder what you would have done. He wants to be an engineer. lt's engineer. You understood me, right? - Yes. Why can't l? That's why l said you need brains. Sir, boss is calling you. Come on. Mr. Roshanlal, leave the job if you cannot do the work. Otherwise l would have to send your report to my seniors. Why is your mind these days? l have been hiding your mistakes since last one year. One year. You always make mistakes in the calculations. You always make some mistake in the calculations. Today, if l wouldn't have checked it then... ...l too would have to suffer its consequences along with you. Take this file. And get your glasses checked. l...will be careful. Hi. Hi, Prem. lt's Meher. Oh. Meher. So you have started missing me... ...my dream killer? Shut up. Prem, stop flirting. l didn't call you for that reason. Hello. l too don't enjoy flirting with you. And l came to know that our dreams were killed because of you. l...l know. But you know what? You are responsible for that we well. lf you wouldn't have spoken about me in the music room... ...Kabir wouldn't have heard it and... ...he wouldn't have told father everything about you. Lives of the other three is getting ruined because of you. What? You are blaming me for it? lt is your mistake. Our dreams were killed because of you. And you are blaming me for it. That is great. Enough. Stop it now. Your phrases and your ways of proposing are the same. Okay. You didn't like the way l proposed. Then dear tell me... ...did you at least like the guy? - Prem, don't talk nonsense. Look, l tried calling Param a number of times. He isn't taking my calls. l think he is angry with me as well. Prem, you should give courage to your friends. Get them together and lead them to your dreams. l think the other three have lost courage. l don't know about them but you... ...seem to have become very courageous. Beware if you try to keep any relationship... ...with those scoundrels, henceforth. l will be your worst enemy. lf you permit, can l come in? Father, you? l have come to tell you that... ...factories don't run by keeping... ...your foot on the desk in your office. They run on hard work. You need to get behind the workers and make them work hard. They run on cooperation. Learn to respect work, son. Learn to respect work. And come to me with the today's records within half an hour. Hello. How are you, Pure Punjabis? Buddies, what has my father got me into? Yes, l agree. But what father says isn't wrong either. My father doesn't say anything. Whenever l look at him, he looks away. My father says that he has taken a lot of loan for my education. Father says so. Father says so. Father says so. We can at least meet, right? Or does father say something for that as well? Be a man, son. Don't be scared of girls. Everyday you do some new mischief in college. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. He says so. Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so. l am sad. When will you pass? You couldn't clear a single class in all these years? Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so. He says so. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so. He says so. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. You keep loitering around. This won't help you survive. Like a leech, you have sucked all my blood. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. Whose child are you? There is no pleasure or joy. l haven't a moment of peace after your birth. Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so. He says so to me. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so. He says so to me. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. When you take your Enfield for a round. You ask for Rs. 500 and you fuel it up for Rs. 20. You are fooling your father. You splurge with my hard earned money. Sometimes notices, sometimes fines. You are the talk of the town. Son, l can no longer bear your expenses. Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so. He says so. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. Getting together with perverts... ...you have ruined my reputation. With a bowl in my hand... ...you have made me a beggar. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. He says so to me. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. Getting together with perverts... ...you have ruined my reputation. With a bowl in my hand... ...you have made me a beggar. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. He says so to me. Daddy says so. Daddy says so. You keep changing your hair style. Sometimes spikes, sometimes curls. l don't understand your strange fashion sense. Daddy says so. Daddy says so to me. Daddy says so to me. father says so. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. My daddy. My dear father. No. Are we at someone's condolence meet? ldiots, l came running from my father's machines. Thinking that l will meet you all. l will recall old memories. And you are behaving as if... As if Meher has become your sister-in-law. lt is not funny. Son, you lost your touch. Now you know? What the machines in the factory have done to me? Convince your families. Otherwise our Pure Punjabi Band... ...will always remain an unfulfilled dream. You are right. lf we keep giving in to the demands of our family... ...we will start greying in our youth. Both of you so easily said it. But the way the situation is at my place... ...l cannot even think about going against my family. Yes. l, too, have stopped thinking about this. Now l am concentrating on farming with my father. And he is happy with that. But are you happy? We studied together. We like same things. ln our school why did God only give us this talent? Why did only we think of making a band? Because we were fools, son. That's why. Think. Why don't we want to be a doctor, an engineer or a businessman? Because God hasn't made us for that. We souls are linked to music. Our heart has always told us to do something different. Do something different. - Enough. You might be right. You are right. But my parents are like God to me. And l can't hurt them any more. l, too, cannot see my father sad any more. What can we say about dreams? ' They come when we close our eyes... ...and end when we open them. 'Think. Why don't we want to be a doctor, an engineer or a businessman? ' 'Because God hasn't made us for that.' 'We souls are linked to music.' Oh ring, l shine and polish you. Sons are like sweet cake for mothers. May God bestow all mothers with them. Listen to me, oh, ring. Oh crow. Mothers are like the acacia shade in the desert. Father, why do you always sing this song? Son, it is great. Gurdas Maan has sung such a nice song. He showed a glimpse of Punjab's heritage. lf one has to write a song it should be like this. And if one has to sing a song, he should sing it like this one. Here you go, sir. Here's your tea. Did you give it to my son? Sir, l called him long back. Where is he? You should take care of him. He is sad. He lost his childhood friends. You are right, sir. What you are right? l asked where is he? He... Sir, he is sitting under that tree. l think he is writing a letter to his friend. Stupid, why would he write a letter. This is the mobile generation. He can talk his friends whenever he wants. Let me check, has my son really... ...forgone worldly pleasures and became a farmer. l am so stupid. l didn't speak to him properly ever since he has come back. What are you doing, Param? Father, when l was small you used to often sing a song. Today when l saw you working in the field... ...l recalled that song. So l wrote it down in my song book. Look at it. Aren't you satisfied getting me insulted in the college? That you are taking that path again? l wonder at what inauspicious hour did l sing that song... ...that you became a writer. l will end this forever today. l don't know what crime l had committed... ...that l was given such a stubborn child. l was better off being childless than having such a child. No. No, please, father. No, father. No, father. Please. Please. Father, this is my dream. Father... Father! No! 'l was better off being childless than having such a child.' 'Think. Why don't we want to be a doctor, an engineer or a businessman?' 'Because God hasn't made us for that.' 'We souls are linked to music.' 'l was better off being childless.' Raj. - l will go and call the doctor. All of you, please go out. Nurse... - Come on. - Hurry up. 'l don't know what crime l had committed...' '...that l was given such a stubborn child.' 'l was better off being childless than having such a child.' 'No, father. This is my dream. Father...' Mr. Dayal Singh? Patient is out of danger now. He has regained consciousness. But there is a bad news. Due to the impact on the spinal cord... ...Param lower body is not reacting. Doctor, my Param will get well, right? Look, l cannot say anything. But there is nothing to worry about. lt can take a month or two. lt is possible... Yes. But it is expensive. You should arrange for money at the earliest. Our Lord answers all prayers. Those who take His name wins all battles. Oh mortal being... Why are you sad? Oh mortal being... Why are you sad? lf He closes one path, He opens many more. He opens many more. You look for Him outside. He speaks from within you. He speaks from within you. He is always with you. Oh mortal being... Why are you sad? Oh mortal being... Father... l am in urgent need of money. Otherwise my friend will become a handicap. Since how many days have you been working in the factory? lf we treat you as the manager... ...you have already taken more money from the factory than your salary. You owe the factory some money. My friend is struggling for his life. And you are tallying accounts with me? While making money have you forgotten that l am your son. l am not a worker. So what should l do? l am not here to give charity. l gave birth to you so that you grow up and expand my business. Son... l donate money to orphanages and welfare homes every month. And as far as considering you a son or a worker is concerned... Son, l have given you a lot of luxuries. l got insulted as well. Because of your dramatic friends. One more thing. Those who perform... They are given some money to keep evil away. And not cheques amounting to millions. Here. Dayal Singh, your small piece of land... ...was in the middle of my land. l tried buying it out from you had a higher price a number of times. Why all of a sudden today... l wouldn't have... dared to sell you... ...my food providing mother. But this helpless... ...and circumstance driven Dayal Singh's son... ...is on the verge of becoming handicap, Mother. Accept it as His desire. Accept whatever He does. Whether He gives you joy or sorrow. Accept it gracefully. Accept it gracefully. Be His follower. Oh mortal being... Why are you sad? Oh mortal being... Why are you sad? Raj! Why are you punishing yourself? Why are you crying, mother? lf a father who belongs to an army family... ...has a son who is a weak singer... ...then people will mock lG Hardeep Singh. That is why your son will have to be strong. You leave. Your tears will weaken me. Don't...misunderstand your father. He is not your enemy. My destiny is my enemy, mother. Let's go, father. Mother... From the time brother Vijay has returned from college... ...he has changed completely. lt feels as if he has become mature. He neither talks, nor laughs, nor goes anywhere. He just stays so quiet. lt is very difficult to kill your desires, dear. And my Vijay is suffering inside. He is punishing himself. Accept whatever He does. Accept whatever He does. Whether He gives you joy or sorrow. Accept it gracefully. Accept it gracefully. Be His follower. Oh mortal being... Why are you sad? Oh mortal being... Why are you sad? Hello, brother. Galti. - Yes, father? Where are you going? l am going for some work, father. What work? And is this the time to go to work? Father, l have started my own business. l can go whenever l want. And all you want is money. Money. l have decided that l will please you by making money. Lease? No, please. Please. - Yes. Yes. l will please you, son. A beating... - Lalit. Yes, brother? Why are you after him day and night? lt's nothing, brother. He doesn't do any work. He makes me suffer a loss everyday. Now he is saying that he is going to work. Tell me, is this a time to go to work? Look, he is nave. You shouldn't scold him all the time. Go. Go and see. He might end up doing something wrong. Go. - Okay, brother. - Very good. Prem... What have you decided? - Tell me, when do you want to go. l don't feel this is right. lt's not about how you feel, Vijay. lt is the question of our friend's life. l don't think anything will happen there. l agree. Okay, if not for Param, then come for me. Meher. - Yes? What is it, dear? Why aren't you eating anything? Father, l was thinking about something. About what? Father, have you read Bhagavad-Gita? Yes. Why? ln that Lord Krishna has said that if we want... ...we can find peace even in a battlefield. Yes. Right. You too could have found another solution. Dear, which battlefield am l a part of. ln the battlefield of your principles. You defeated those four boys. No, dear. l defeated a lie with my principles. This is also a fact that music runs in their veins, father. And if a lie makes someone's life... ...and leads someone to his destination... ...then that lie isn't a lie, father. Dear, l just did my duty. l expelled them from college because of their mistake. But yes... if anything wrong has happened to them because of me... then l will bring them back. Applause. Thank you, friends. You applauded for me. A true artist like me hungers nothing but one. Applause? - No. Money. l mean your applaud is my biggest wealth and treasure. Applause. Devdas. Devdas.
