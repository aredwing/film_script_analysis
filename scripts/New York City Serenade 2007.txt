(sniffles) Yeah. Yeah. By the way, what time is it? We gotta get downtown. The way they had to let each other go even though they were in love, - it's so sad. - Pretty sad. Let's grab a cab, what do you say? The expression on his face when he waved goodbye to her on that train platform, I mean, they loved each other so much and at the same time, he knew they couldn't be together. I thought that part was a little schmaltzy, actually. Oh please, I saw you crying. What? Professor Broder? Oh, Lynne! - Are you just coming from the movie? - Yes. Yes! a va? Oh my God. Wow, so are we! This is my fianc Owen. Owen, this is my French Lit professor. - Noam Broder. - "Norbiter?" No no, Broder... Noam... Professor. - (Lynne laughs) - Pleased... to... meet you. Wow, this is so funny. Professor Broder actually recommended this film to our class and now here he is. There you are. It's so funny. Isn't it funny? Uh, yeah. Very funny. (both laugh) Yeah, were you sitting in the fifth or sixth row? Yeah. Yes yes, I thought I heard your laugh, yeah. - Really? - Yes. She has a very... very distinctive laugh. (Owen laughs) Yeah. Sounds like a goose. - We gotta get going. - Right. We're going downtown to hear his friend's band play. Oh, that sounds loud. - Well, I'll see you Tuesday. - Oui, la prochaine. - la prochaine. Plaisir de te voir. - Au revoir. Au revoir. Nice to meet you. Au revoir. bientt. What was that about? What? Noam? What kind of name is that? Noam? Why were you acting all nervous? He's incredibly intelligent. Yeah, I could tell by the pipe. Who still smokes a pipe? Who does he think he is, Vincent Price? - Shut up, you cry-baby. - I wasn't crying. I had popcorn salt in my eye. (band continues) # If I could see the world the way that it sees you # # Maybe I'd understand # # The stupid things I do # # If I could teach myself # # To wake up from this dream # # Pretend I'm someone else, well that's enough for me! # # I'm too scared to live, I'm too young to die... # (song continues) What can I get for you? A couple of beers on the band tab. - They don't have a tab anymore. - What? The manager said they were taking advantage of it. The manager said they're a bunch of alcoholics and he ain't gonna pay for it anymore. (people cheering) I can't believe they cut off their band tab. I can't believe they didn't do it a long time ago. Those guys are a bunch of drunks. Well, it's not like they pay them to play here. Then you're in here every night putting all your booze on their tab. All my booze? - I have a couple of beers with Ray. - Okay. Oh, what? Now I'm a drunk too? I'm not saying you're a drunk, but you do drink quite a bit. Look who's here. Well, nice of you guys to show up for the end of the set. - That's the best part. - It's my fault. Tonight was the last night of "Le Histoire de Jim" at the Film Forum. What's that? Some French film she wanted to see. - How was it? - Amazing. - I caught a good nap. - There any nudity? No. Man, for 10 bucks to sit through you at least expect a little nudity. Tell me about it. God, and you call yourself a director? Why don't you just go and rent a porno? I'm down. - Oh, guess what? - What? My short film got into that film festival. - They picked that thing? - Hey. Uh, yeah, that's right. And they're giving me two first-class tickets to go there. Buddy, when do we depart? - Yeah, I don't think so. - Sorry about that, buddy. I never get to go anywhere. So where to? I'm going home. It's late. She's got to work early. All right. Well, give me a call if you can't, you know, reform. Oh, hey? - Shit, I totally forgot. - What? Oh, fuck. Shit. What's up? Devon's car. - Oh, shit. - What? - Devon's car broke down. - Oh, this sucks. He's got no way to get his drums home. I told him I'd help him out. Forgot all about it. Can't it wait till tomorrow? I can't. It'll get ripped off. Look, if it's too much trouble, it's no sweat. I told you I'd give you a hand. - I appreciate it. - I'm sorry. - I forgot all about it. - Don't worry about it. No, you know what? You know what? Forget it. You guys go on home. It's totally fine. No man, I told you I'd help you. I told him I'd help him. - It's okay. Go help him. - Is it okay? - I mean, if it's not... - It's okay. Why do you keep asking me if it's okay? If it's too much of a hassle, I can... Just go start bringing out the stuff, man. I'll just go in there and start bring the stuff out. I'll call you when I get home. It'll be late. Call me tomorrow. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay. - Love you. - I love you too. She buy it? I can't imagine how with that performance. - What do you mean? - Talk about overacting! What? I was being convincing. (sighs) I hate lying to her like that. Well, don't lie then. Next time, don't keep saying all that "if it's too much of a hassle" shit. Hey, I don't know what you're talking about. I was realistic. Yeah well, it sounded phony as hell. (instrumental music playing) (bass beat thumping) - I don't know, man. - What's wrong? What? I think this might be a private party. - We weren't even invited. - We sure were. - That dude Pete told me about it. - Yeah, he told you about it. That's not the same as inviting us. Let's not overthink it, pal, all right? It's fine. I know these people. Come on. They're good friends of mine. I'm gonna go grab beers. Stop being a pansy and try to have some fun. Hi. Hi. Owen. Sorry? Owen. Rachel. Hi. So, are you a student? So you guys didn't happen to see a satchel in here, did you? I seem to have misplaced my satchel. I thought I left it in here. - You're not supposed to smoke in here. - Mind your business, kid. You guys didn't see a bunch of important papers inside a satchel? I mean, really important papers. The band I'm in, we just signed a contract... a record deal. You ever heard of that? (both laugh) I know. Crazy, right? Figures a guy like me would leave a three... or four... actually $4 million contract lying around. You know? - Sir? - Buzz off. - Are you a friend of Bertrand? - Who's that? My brother. It's his party. Oh, Bertrand? Of course. Like a brother to me. I've bailed his ass out of hot water more than once. Where is that little rascal? I've been looking all over for him. - Where do you know him from? - From Paris. - You ever hear of it? - You are so full of shit. (both giggle) Here's the deal: Who wants to party? Raise your hands. (girl giggling) Mmm! Mmm, ahh! Sir, I'm fairly certain you weren't invited here. Listen, little buddy, I already told you once to stop bothering me, didn't I? Now go and get yourself a soda. You're sure this is the place? This is the address Ray gave me. Oh. Seeing some fine college-age ladies up in here. - Word. - Need to adjust our approach - to suit the crowd. And hello. - Word up. What say we go get our drink on and let the games begin? I'm totally down with that. Oh, hello. What are you doing? He's totally going through everything. Hey, you'd better not go in there. - Vintage cherry. - (girls giggling) Ladies, come on. You know Bertrand and I go way back. He's so funny. Oh my God. What exactly are you looking for? Jackpot. (both moaning) Wait. I... I should find my friends. I'm what you call a Rhodes scholar: Philosophy major, all-American lacrosse player. As a matter of fact, I played on the Olympic lacrosse team. There is no Olympic lacrosse team. Which made things very lonely for him. L... I mean, that was... really nice. But I should really go back with my friends 'cause... (girl moaning) Go go go. Chugalug if you're gonna do it. Okay, that's enough there, sweetheart. Goodness gracious. - Ah, Lauren. - 'Kay, sorry. Sorry. Okay okay. Okay. I dare you... (laughs) - Lauren? - Spit it out, sweet pea. I dare you to... what's your name again? My name's Ray. All my homeys call me Boots. I dare you to make out with Mr. Boots. Oh! You dirty thing. Okay, all right. I'm sorry, darlin'. I don't make the rules. I just play by 'em. Bring it. - Okay, here's what I propose... - Hit 'em with it, brother. - I got six, seven bucks in my pocket. - I got a sawbuck in mine. Okay, that's about I propose we isolate ourselves off to an intimate little spot - just north of here a spell. - I know the spot well... quaint, quiet atmosphere. You guys are gonna love it. - And spend it all on sea breezes. - 11 bucks worth. - And here's where it get good. - Tell 'em. We hit an ATM machine. One or both of you two gals plug in your pin code. Get some more dinero, get back there before our stools get cold. And by stools of course we mean bar stools. You're both really weird. Look at you blush. You must really like us. No. I bet we could say anything and you'd blush. - No, don't. - Banana bread. You guys are really crazy or something. Oh, look. - Red as an apple. - Apostrophe. - Table top. - Should we... Yeah, let's go find David and those guys. Let's go find David and those guys. But then let's get rid of David and those guys because those guys are really annoying. And gay. Probably gay. - Should we come? - Should we come with or... No rap there. Oh! My God! Come on! Ooh! Who's the big daddy? Come on! Whoo! Show me the side, man! Come on, boy! Come on! Take it off! Whoo! Yeah, I like it like that. Yeah. Oh, come on, Big Daddy. Come on! Oh! Faster! Come on, take it off! - Ohh! - Ahhh! - Whoo! - Oh yeah! Do that dance! Yeah! Aww! Ohh! Who's upstairs? Nobody's supposed to be up there. My little sister. Fucking watch it, man. Assholes. Oh, what a dick, man! Why don't you come over here? I'm much more fun than that lamp. (music stops) - Girl: Oh! - Girl #2: Oh, what's that? Turn the light back on! That is my little sister. Hey, guys. - Holy cow. - Bertrand. Shut up and get downstairs. We weren't even doing anything. Get downstairs. Get downstairs, you two. Unbelievable. They were just showing me around, you know, guys? 'Cause I just got back from Iraq. I gotta tell you, it's fucking brutal over there. Kick him in the balls, Bertrand. - Whoo. - You crashed the wrong party, dude. Nobody's crashing any party, Daddy. Come on. Your ass is grass, boy. Hey, Owen? Owen? (hip-hop music playing) Hey, Owen? Ray? - Your ass is grass. - Yeah, I know. - I heard you the first time. - You're about to get a beatdown. You're gonna want to relax there, husky. Believe me, I understand your being sore, okay? I'm the last guy you want in a room alone with your sister. But hey, no harm, no foul. Right, pal? Let me just get my friends and get out of here. - I'm gonna fuck you up. - Okay. Okay, but one at a time here, boys. I ain't Superman. Ahhhhh! Bertrand: I see you with my sister again, I'm gonna kick your ass! Good friends of yours, huh? I may have exaggerated just a bit. - (screaming continues) - (Ray laughs) (TV on low volume) (answering machine beeps) Male voice: You have two new messages. (beeps) Lynne: Hey, it's me. Are you there? Uh, it's about, I don't know, like, 3:30. I couldn't sleep so... Are you still out? You're probably asleep. Okay, well, I just wanted to say good night. I love you, Owen. - Bye. - (machine beeps) Male voice: Two new messages. - 9:06 PM. - (beeps) Ray, it's Mary. I got your message. You know, you only disappoint your daughter when you cancel plans. What am I supposed to do, huh? What do you expect me to do? - I had a friggin' gig. - What do you expect me to tell your four-year-old? "Daddy can't take you to the park because he's hung over?" I'm sick and tired of it, Ray... - (beeps) - Male voice: 2:28 AM. - (beeps) - Hey buddy, it's Matt. Uh, it's pretty late. It's, I don't know, late. Listen: My father died today and l... I need you guys to come out to Jersey tomorrow to help me out. My father was Orthodox and they have this thing where they have to be buried within 24 hours and I need six people to, you know, carry the box... Matt: Minions. That's what they call them... minions. Whatever. I can get two guys but I need four more guys. So could you call me? Bye. - (beeps) - (sighs) - Shit. - (phone rings) - Hello? - Owen: Hey. Hey. - You get a message from Matt? - Yeah, wow. I know. Anyway... I guess we gotta go out to Jersey tomorrow. Yeah, I'll get Devon's car. Why don't you call Russ and Terry? How the hell am I supposed to get out of work? That's a good question. I'll see you in the morning. Yeah. Hello, my name is Lois. I'm calling today to tell you about a spectacular new offer. Could I please speak to the lady of the house? Very good. Well, I'm calling today to offer you a chance to experience the luxury of Dr. Fedder's Miracle Cream. Hello? Shit-faced fuck-ass bitch. - Boss lady ask where I was? - Of course she did. What you think? Now you better get in there and talk to her before she fires your ass. I've got your coupons for you. Thanks, darlin'. Is this from last Sunday's paper? It better be from last Sunday's paper. Owen? Owen? Owen? What? There's a customer who says her photos are too dark. - Owen? - Tell Mr. Smork. I did. He told me to tell you. They're all dark and fuzzy. You can't even tell what you're looking at. Well, sometimes with these disposable cameras... I paid 25 bucks for three of those goddamned things and now you're telling me they don't work. I didn't say they don't work. These are my vacation pictures. - Well, I... - This is all I got to look at from two weeks in Myrtle Beach. - What am I supposed to do? - What I was going to suggest... - Two weeks in Myrtle Beach! - Quit fucking yelling at me. What's going on? I, uh... I was just trying to get my film developed. Yes, ma'am. What seems to be the problem? There was no need for him to scream like that. I'm sorry for screaming... Go back to the developing station. There was no need for him to scream like that. Oh, I agree. And oh boy, is he gonna get it. (knock on door) Good morning. I just stopped by to let you know I'm heading downtown to the warehouse. You look beautiful in sage. Uh, I thought... Lois went to the warehouse on Thursday. No... Yeah yeah yeah, she did, but remember, she got all the way down there and didn't have the right keys? She had the right keys, just for the wrong cabinets. I thought she got everything on Thursdays. I thought... - (phone ringing) - No no no, she didn't. - That's why I gotta head down there... - Where's the log? Did you do something different with your hair? I got a perm... awhile ago. Looks great. You look really great. So I'm gonna head down there. I'll... I'll be back. You know, it's probably gonna take me the better part of the day, so I'll see you tomorrow. You listen to me, boy: Do not talk to the customers, period. Understand me? That is not your department. That is my department. I have the training. You do not have the training. Understand me? Man, I'd like to get with that Rosario Dawson. Yeah, I'm sure she'd love that too. Where the fuck are these guys? Lord knows neither one of them has a goddamned job. Here they come. Fuck! You guys wore a suit coat too? - So everybody wore a suit but me? - Because you're an idiot. What do you think you wear to a funeral, dickwad? Guy wears a red sweatshirt to be a pallbearer. Come on, let's get out of here. You look like a retard going on a field trip. - Fuck off. - Come on! Let's just get this over with. Hey, who's got the directions? I do: Take the Lincoln Tunnel to the Turnpike. Yeah, then what? Don't worry. I'll let you know one step at a time. Would you just give me the directions? Smork is such a prick. I can't believe I graduated film school and I work in a fucking photomat. Buddy, you graduated from the School of Video Arts on 30th Street. - So? - It was a four-week course. So? I still graduated. Hey, we could give your boss a couple of crank calls. - That'd really fuck him up. - Yeah, that's a real good idea. - Imbecile. - Remember last time we did it? He got all spooked and closed early. - Freaked him out. - Let's do it. Use Terry's cell phone. "Let's do it. Let's use Terry's cell phone." Idiot. Terry, seriously, give me the directions. Just keep your eyes on the road, man. I'll navigate. Man, you couldn't navigate a trip to the john, you neurotic... Okay. Okay. Let's all take a nice pill. He's right. We are, after all, on our way to bury a man. (giggling, laughing) Whoo! Oh! Oooh! (piano playing) (music continues) Hey hey hey hey. Thanks again for coming. You guys were a big help. - No, it was fun. - Hey, you get some food? I'm starving, man. I wouldn't mind something. Dude, they got baba ganoush, three kinds of smoked fish, trout, potato salad, garbanzo salad, tongue... - Let's just take it easy there, man. - No, that's what it's there for, man. That's what the food is there for: To eat. I'm starving. I wouldn't mind something. - Russ. - What? There's a whole tableful. Guys guys guys, please, just go get some food. - It was a really nice service. - Man, it was really nice. Yeah, I really liked that thing you read. It was from... from "The Hobbit." Whose place is this? My aunt's. She survived the Holocaust. Wow. My dad used to live in the apartment upstairs before he died. Wow. - You guys want to come see it? - Now? Yeah, right now. It's like floor-to-ceiling junk. You can have whatever you want. - Jesus, Russ. - What? You think you got enough food there, Russ? I can always go back and get more. What were you saying? I was telling these guys you should check out my father's stuff. - Dead father? - Yeah, l... Whatever you want, I mean it. I don't even want to look at the stuff. Maybe another time. You don't want to go through that stuff today. No man, that's cool. I just want to get rid of it. I mean, I'll take a browse through if you want to get rid of stuff. All right. I'll go get the key. Great. - Are you fucking crazy? - What? What? Take whatever you want. Take it all. Awesome. Shouldn't, you know, your family go through this stuff? Trust me, they don't want any of it. I have to use the toilet. Excuse me. Jesus, he's really tweaked. Okay... This dust is killing my allergies. - Russ: Holy shit. - Leave that stuff alone, Russ. - He said we could. - (piano increases) Let me use your cell phone. Is everybody going to be using this thing now? It's brand new. It's a freakin' technological device; it's not a toy. Don't be an ass. It's not a pay phone, all right? It costs money every time you use it. - That makes sense. - I got this thing for work. I didn't get it so we could all make prank calls to our bosses - and call our girlfriends. - Check it out! This shit's vintage. They sell this for like 50 bucks. Take it off, you weasel. (phone ringing) - Hey. - Hey. - How was the funeral? - Christ, what a nightmare. Matt's buzzed out of his skull. - Oh, no. - Yeah. He's in there giving away all of his dead father's possessions. Oh, poor guy. And the worst part is I'm in Jersey. Well, it's nice that you're all there for your friend. Remind me never to go in a car with these guys ever again. How about you? How you doing? I'm good. What do you want to do for dinner? - I'm taking you out. - Wow. Okay. Where? II Buco. What's the special occasion? Because I love you. I love you too. - Meet me there at 8:00. - Okay, hotshot. Bye. - Lynne? - Karen? Hi! - Oh, you look great. - You too. Gosh, I haven't seen you since your wedding. Well, you're just in time for the divorce. Oh no, Karen. I'm so sorry. - Not me. - What happened? - Have you got time for a cup of coffee? - Yeah, sure. Great. I'm just waiting for my friend. She's inside paying. Here she comes. Lynn, this is my friend Rachel. - Rachel, this is Lynne. - Hi. - It's nice to meet you. - You too. I haven't seen Lynne in like a year. Yeah. Do you want to sit with us while we catch up a bit? - Yeah, I'd love to. - Great, let's go. - So how's Owen? - He's great. Actually, I just got off the phone with him. - Really? - Yeah. He's up in Jersey. Unfortunately, one of his childhood friend's father passed away. - Oh, no. - I know. But yeah, we were just making dinner plans. Same old, same old. - It's so good to see you. - I know. You too. Damn, girls had some big nips in the '70s. I believe they're called areolas. Check out this hot plate. This is definitely some kind of antique. Put it down, you ass. This isn't a tag sale. He said we could take anything we want. Hey, put it back, Russ. Where's Matt? Give me my phone back. - Matt? - Knock it off, Russ. I'm just collecting things. (horns honking) Let's make sure all the windows are up. Exhaust fumes are toxic. Damn this traffic. I told you we should have sat somewhere until after rush hour. That makes no sense: Either way we gotta wait. This way we're in the car. Thank you, Mr. Logic. - Oh, fuck! - Hey, come on. It's bumper to bumper! This tunnel makes me so claustrophobic. - Fuck. I'm gonna be so late. - Relax. What's the rush? I'm supposed to meet Lynne like right now. I mean, if you think about it, we're underneath the river. Great, let's all drink and drive. I'm freaking out in this tunnel. I mean, I am starting to freak out in... - Calm down. - Oh Lord, let me out of this car. Uh! You got any gum? - Did you finish that? - Yeah. - What about a mint? You got any mints? - I was saving that. I need something for my breath. Lynne'll freak if she smells booze. What? You're not allowed to drink now? I don't want to show up to dinner with booze on my breath. - Do you mind? - You shouldn't drink then. - It's all about choices, my friend. - Whatever. Don't get all preachy right now. If you don't want to smell like booze, don't drink. Just pull over up there. You don't want to feel bad about lying to your girlfriend, - don't have a girlfriend. - Or I could just not lie to her. Or you could ask yourself why you got a girlfriend that you feel the need to lie to. I'll tell you what: Let me worry about my girlfriend, okay? Fine. - I'll tell you this, though... - I really don't want to hear it. You're making a big mistake taking your lady to this film festival... Here we go. Just think about all the action we could operate down there. - Think about the lady fair. - I'm taking my girlfriend. I'm just saying, how often do we have the opportunity to party and rage - at a film festival? - You're not going, Ray. - Fine. - You better hurry up and get this car back to Devon's so he can go sell some more weed. All right. All right, it's not like I'm the star of your movie or anything. That's right: You're not. You had one line and you fucked that up. Suit yourself. See ya. - Hey! - Yeah? - You coming by tonight? - Yeah, I'll try. I mean if you can get a permission slip. Fuck off. (door buzzing) (door unlocking, creaking open) - Daddy. - Hi, peanut. What are you doing here? Oh, I just came by to bring you a quarter. - You know what else I brought you? - What? I big kiss. Come here. There I am walking through this graveyard with, you know, the Marx Brothers carrying this wooden naked casket and they're all complaining. And the priest or whatever is, like, saying this long prayer. Matt's crying and it was just so... depressing. - What's up? - What do you mean? You've been awfully quiet. You've been talking. Okay. Uh, I'll let you talk. How's that? What would you like me to say? I don't know. Maybe... tell me what's going on. Why don't you tell me, Owen? Tell you what? How about this: Ahem. Have you been faithful to me? What? Or how about this: Have you been faithful since we've been engaged to be married? How about that, Owen? Lynnie... I have absolutely no idea... I mean... I swear to God. - Baby. - Don't! Don't you "baby" me. Cartoon voice: Gentlemen, start your engines. Voice #2: Wait. What am I waiting for? (cartoon continues) Hey. Would you put that out? Scumbag. Scumbag. (giggling) Did you call? You're supposed to call before you come. Sorry I'm late, Ted. Fuck, it's hot in here. - The air conditioner's broke. - Oh, shithole. Daddy gave me a quarter! Yeah? Could he spare it? If you're gonna come over, you gotta call first. Call before you come... that's the arrangement. Where you been? Where do you think I've been? Work. - You got my check? - What's he doing here? Babysitting. Any other questions? Girl: Mommy, tell Ted to turn my show back on! Turn her show back on! - "SmackDown" is on! - Turn it back, Ted! It sounds like you guys have got a real mature relationship going. Fuck it's hot in here. God, I hate summer in this fucking city. - He living here now? - None of your business. Fuck if it's none of my business. If you're living with somebody, I've got a right to know. Hey, you've got no rights when it comes to me! What right did I have when I was sitting at the fucking Hilton Garden Inn for two day waiting for you to show up, huh? - The Hilton Garden Inn again. - Yeah, that again! That again, Ray! Fuck you! You're a real classy girl, a classy dame. If you would just tell me what this is about... What it's about? - You want to know what it's about? - Yes, I would. - I found out. - You found out what? - What are you talking about? - Liar. If you would please just tell me. Rachel. Mary: The kid needs new shoes. I'm supposed to start her at kindergarten in the fall and they want to charge me Now how the hell am I supposed to afford that? You tell me. I told you I could bring you some money on Friday. It's not about me. It's about keeping a roof over your daughter's head. - Okay. - And do me a favor: When you tell her you're gonna take her someplace, don't call and cancel an hour beforehand. I had a gig. That's the same exact kind of shit you used to pull on me. - Message received. - You pulled the same selfish childish crap on me when you were supposed to be my husband. Okay, look, I had a gig, okay? And don't worry. I'll get you your money. - It ain't about money, Ray! - Here we go. - It ain't about money! - Keep it down. You always had a gig or some bullshit thing. Well, when are you gonna grow up and be a man, Ray? Huh? When are you gonna grow up and be a man? Christ's sake. Honey, you gotta believe me, - it wasn't... - It wasn't what? You filthy lowlife pig. It... oh, it wasn't anything. I'll tell you what it wasn't... - Honey, please. - It wasn't me you were fucking at that party because I wasn't even invited to that party. - Baby... - I told you! I am not your baby. I am not your sweetie or anything else. Lynne. Fuck you. Yeah yeah! Yeah, that's right! That's right, walk away, you fuck! Walk away like you always do! - Is everything cool now? - Stay out of it, Ted. Just want to make sure everything's all right. Ted, stay out of it. Daddy? Hey, I gotta go, baby doll. When are you coming over again? Soon. (door opens, closes) Right on time as usual. Sorry. - How'd it go? - Aw, it was all right. A couple of knuckleheads starting brawling so they cleared the place early. Lynne broke up with me. Who you taking to the film festival? Man over speaker: Good morning, folks. This is your captain speaking, inviting you to sit back, relax and enjoy the flight. Anything we can do to make it a more enjoyable one, - please don't hesitate to ask. - Hey. - What? - What are you doing? What? I'm asleep. What's it look like? - Come on, man. - What? - We just ordered drinks. - Fuck off. Come on, buddy. How often do we get to sit in first class? What the fuck is your point? Leave me alone. Hey. What? Listen to me very carefully: I'm going to sleep. - I know... - No. See? 'Cause my life is in utter shambles, okay? My head is pounding like a fucking jackhammer and I don't think I've ever been quite this depressed. So please, just please, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Terrific. Thanks. And you know, just keep 'em coming, huh? Better. Better. Good. (toilet flushing) (toilet bangs) There's supposed to be a car for me. I'd give anything for a freakin' aspirin. I told you not to drink so much on the plane. I didn't even hardly drink. It was the altitude. Are you joking? You had like nine of those little vodkas. Oh, and I forgot about you, little baby. Take it easy, will you? The screening's in a few hours. I can just see you getting all belligerent. I'm fine. Man: Keep it a little bit ahead of me. A little bit ahead of me. Come on. - Holy shit! - What? - Look who it is. - Where? - Oh my God! - Don't take the umbrella. - Holy cow! - What? - It's Wallace fucking Shawn! - No way. I can't believe I'm seeing Wallace Shawn right now. - This is so cool. - Wait a second, who? Wallace Shawn. They're giving him the Lifetime Achievement award at the film festival. - That guy? - I gotta get him to see my film. Why the hell does he get a limo? Look at him... it looks like there's something wrong with him. We'd better be getting a limo. They sending us a limo? No, don't take that! - Hide it... Hello. - Hi. - Can I have your autograph, please? - Lifetime Achievement - and here he is, right here! - Hold on, that guy? Hey, buddy, have you not seen "My Dinner with Andre"? Yeah. Bill Cosby, right? Oh! "The Princess Bride." Oh my God, "Princess Bride"... "Inconceivable!" I mean... Did you know that short men can do things big men can't do? Let's go talk to him. Let's go connect... Hey, what are you gonna do? First off, I'm gonna bum us a ride in that stretch. - What? Wait. - Just stand here and let me handle it. Hold on, just... What did we talk about? - What? - We talked about this, Ray. This is a very big deal for me. - Buddy, relax. - Listen. I told you; I agreed to give you my extra ticket. I'm not gonna do anything. I have been invited. These people have invited me here and I agreed to let you come along. I'm just gonna go introduce myself. That's why we're here. No no! See, that's just what I'm talking about. We're not here, see? I'm here and I agreed to let you come along. Fine. Forget it. I was gonna go invite him to your movie that I happen to be featured in. But just forget it. I am staying at the Four Seasons. I'm gonna be there tomorrow afternoon. All right, fine. Just don't... you know, make an ass of yourself. Hold on! You see, this is what I mean. You don't even know where the screening is or what time it is. You're just gonna go over there and make an idiot out of me. Here, give him one of these. Oh, yeah. This'll impress him. Give him the flyer. Please, man, just give him the flyer and come back. (heavy metal playing, wheels screeching) Um, hey hey! I think that's me. Oh, uh, Aaron Brown? - Owen. - Owen Brown? - Owen Green. - Owen... sorry, no. That's Owen Brown... Owen... Owen Green. - There you go. - There... get my stuff. - I got it. - The traffic was... There your chariot awaits. Ha ha ha! Ho ho, buddy, I just totally hooked us up. What happened? What'd you do? We are so fucking down with that guy. Let me tell you: That little fellow had some stank breath. Wait, is he coming to the screening, though? I did you one better, my friend. Just tell me: Did you give him the flyer, yes or no? - Yeah yeah yeah yeah. - (heavy metal resumes) Wait a minute, what the fuck kind of car is this? - Just tell me what he said. - I took care of everything, okay? Hey! - Hey, pal? - Yes, sir. First off, I'm gonna need you to turn down the devil music and crank the AC, okay? Secondly, I'm gonna need you to stop at an establishment that carries spirits commonly known as a liquor store and then it's straight on to the Four Seasons so me and my compatriot here can get our swerve on for the big premiere. Uh, the Four Seasons? That's right. 'Cause l... I was told to take you guys to the... Airport Motor Lodge. No no, that's a mistake. That's a mistake. We're staying at the same place Willy's at. - Who? - Willy. - Wally? - That's the guy. How the hell do you know where he's staying? - The limo driver said so. - Oh, God. Here it is right here: "Take them to the Airport Motor Lodge." Okay okay, pal, trust me on this one, okay? You see this guy sitting right here next to me? - Yeah. - Okay, he's being awarded for his accomplishments in the motion-picture industry - and he's also very exhausted. - Ray. - So the Four Seasons it is. - Yes, sir. Listen, you're not going to get an argument out of me. Listen, and that is a great hotel. It's what we call one of our upper "ecalon" hotels. You know, you got the Oak Ridge Boys coming into town, that's where they'll stay. We had Anne Murray a couple weeks... Hey pal, let's see you do some driving. Yes, sir. Ha ha ha! Ho. Ho ho. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Just, you see... Right... the entrance is right here. And they have electric sliding doors for your convenience, so you don't have to push 'em. Now will you gentlemen be requiring anything else? - No no, that'll be all. - Very good. - Let me give you one of my cards... - That really won't be necessary... - Just in case you need anything... - Drive on! I'm going. Thank you! Thank you! (heavy metal resumes) - What are we doing in here? - Calm down. - I'm gonna go get us checked in. - You know what? I don't want to know what you're gonna do, okay? - Okay. - You're just gonna do it anyway. - Where is a phone? I need a phone. - Everything's fine. I'm so exhausted. I shouldn't have come. Just get ahold of yourself. I'll take care of it. I need a phone. Why don't I have a cell phone? - Why can't I afford a cell phone? - Go find a pay phone and I'll get us checked in. Checked in? We don't even have a room here, you idiot. Hey, I'll take care of it. Don't worry about nothing, all right? Go make your call or whatever and I'll do the rest. Go. My son and his wife won't be arriving until tomorrow night, so just hold the adjoining suite until then. - Woman: Yes, sir. - His name is Paul Shawn, son of myself, Wallace Shawn. Of course, sir. Suite 1211. - Hey there. - Oh, it's you. Ha ha! Hey. You're at the Four Seasons! Us too. Awesome. Awesome. It's a great place. Is there anything else? You and I should get together while you're here. Like I said, I've got some projects I'm looking to set up. Yeah, I remember you mentioned that to me. You seem very excited about the projects. Best of luck. Yeah! Definitely, we'll be in touch, okay? I'll be on the lookout then. Cool! Wally. (machine beeps) - Male voice: You have no messages. - (beeping) Hi. Can I help you, sir? Of course you can. I'm here to check in. Yes, sir. And your name? Paul Shawn, son of Wallace Shawn. Will you be requiring more than one room key, sir? Yeah, um... actually my wife is coming in from a conference in Norway. Uh, so... two would be fine. Lynne's voice: Hey, it's Lynne. I'm not here. - Leave a message. - (beeping) Listen, I'm here at the festival. I just have to... I just need to talk to you, so if you're there, please pick up. I'm so sorry. I just need to talk to you and explain it was nothing. I mean... I know it wasn't nothing. It's just... it meant nothing. - So if l... - (beeping) Ugh! Man: Here are the keys to your room. And here are the keys to the mini bar. Oh, goodness. I'm gonna have to keep this one away from the wife, right? Yes, sir. Hey, can you have some stuff sent up to the room, please? What would you like, sir? A cheese plate and some fruit. I'm having a meeting, uh, and a conference. - And then I have a screening. - No problem, sir. Great. Um... and some sandwiches and champagne. Yes, sir. Any particular kind of sandwich? You know, I really don't know what they like. I'm... I'm having this meeting. It's all new people. That's why we're meeting. And a variety of sandwiches would be perfect. Very good, sir. - And some cakes. - Cakes? Exactly. An assortment of sandwiches, cakes, and some chips. - Chips. - Okay. Thank you. I got something that's gonna cheer you up, homey. What's that? Room key to our deluxe suite, equipped with mini bar. What did you do? I took care of it. Holy shit. What in God's name? Mm-hmm. Not bad, huh? Dude, it's just a stupid short film. I'm not supposed to be in a suite. Hey man, this is what they gave you. Be proud and enjoy it. And also they're sending up some champagne, some sandwiches and some cakes. All for me? I can't believe it. You better start believing it. You're the man right now. - Really? - Yes, really. Now will you please relax and enjoy yourself? You know what? I'm gonna. I'm gonna enjoy this. The Four Seasons, baby! Yeah! Whoo! Now that's what I'm talking about. Now get in there and go take a shower. All right. This is awesome, man! Awesome! Now that's the spirit. Go shower up! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah, that's the ticket. (knock at door) Ha ha! Come on in, bucket man. Excellent. Excellent. You got the cakes? - Yes, sir. - The sandwiches, right? - Yes, sir. - And some chips? - Yes, sir. - Perfect. Yes, hi, this is Mr. Paul Shawn, Wally's son, in room 1212. I'm gonna need a limo to take me to my screening a little bit later. Excellent. Thank you. Whoa. I won't be needing that. I'm sorry, sir. Did you have an arrangement? - Sure. - With? Uh, Mr. Reservoir. - Um... - Mm-hmm. - Mr... - You know, I'm gonna save us all a lot of time here, okay, pal? I'm Wallace Shawn's son, right? His only son. You get the picture? - Um... - Go on. - Thank you for the sandwich... - Uh-huh. - And the chips. The champagne looks beautiful. And, uh, thanks again. Hi, Lynne Banner, extension 15, please. It's Owen. Well, do you know when she'll be back? - Can I leave a message then? - (Ray laughing) - (cartoon playing) - Yeah. Man on TV: Who might I be? - Yes. - Who might you be? (phone ringing) (ringing continues) Shit. Who? No, there's no one here by that name. - How... - May I help you? Yes, it is. Oh, terrific. Excellent. Thank you. Mm-hmm. - I just confirmed the limo. - What limo? The limo that's gonna take us to your big opening, pal. - Hey hey hey. - Come on, give it back. Trust me, you don't want to keep calling her. What the fuck is happening? I feel like I'm drowning. And this too shall pass. - What have I done? - What have you done? You made a movie, that's what. Come on, do you know how many people would kill to be in your shoes? Look at you: You're in a limo on the way to the opening of your movie. Listen, I'm gonna be blunt here: You've got to get over this thing. Okay? This thing is just not worth blowing the opportunity you're gonna have with this film. She financed the film, so... That's water under the bridge. The short films that you are about to see uh, feature the work of some of the... the brightest and the most promising filmmakers and... - Where's Wally? - Before I begin... - We didn't get any snacks. ...all mobile phones... It says mine's up first. How am I supposed to watch a movie without snacks? ...wonderful young filmmakers that are in attendance here tonight. Would you all please stand? Sit sit. Okay. Please. Now remember to cast your votes... I need some Raisinets or something. I told you: Mine's up first. ...some twice. Ha ha. - Please? Okay, enough jokes. Here we go. All right. Move this. Move this. Can I get some Raisinets and a Diet Coke? - Small or large? - Uh. Large. Where is the pay phone? Would you like a small popcorn for a quarter more? No, thanks. Would you like a thing of nachos with cheese substitute for a dollar more? No. No, thanks. Where is the pay phone? It's broke. That's great. Excuse me. Oh, yeah, sorry. - How much? - (beeps) $8.58. For Raisinets and a Diet Coke? - I'll just take the Raisinets. - (register beeping) - (animal snickering) - What the hell is that? There I am. (Ray screaming) I think that went well. What? You're mad? Come on, I dozed off for five minutes. What's the big deal? - The big deal? - Yeah. What's the big deal? Well... it's only six minutes long. That's the big deal. What do you think? You don't have to scream. Oh hey, there's this award- dinner-dance-banquet thing tonight. - We should go to that. - Let's just go back. We've got an early flight. Come on, let's try to get into the spirit of this thing, huh? We weren't even invited. Just do me a favor and don't be a total drip, will you? Of course we're invited. We're a vital part of this film festival. I just want to lay down. Hey, Georgie, take us to that dinner-dance, will you? Dinner-dance, huh? I don't see the dance floor. I do see the bar. Shot of vodka. You in? Two. Mm-hmm. Two more. Yes. Not for me. I need to make a call. You've got to let her go, man. Mind your business. You're gonna regret it. (phone ringing) Just let the machine get it. Machine: Hey, it's Lynne. I'm not here. Leave a message. (beeps) Owen: Hi. It's me again. Listen, this'll be the last time I'm gonna call. So if I don't hear back from you, I'll know it's over. - Just understand something... - Okay, let's go. - That I love you. But dinner's not till 8:00. - I honestly love you... - Can we please go? - And I'm so sorry. So please, pick up. Pick up. Lynne. Lynne. Man: And the award for the best short film goes to... Peter John Mullard for "A Place Called Hope," a provocative and sexy film. (crowd cheering) - You should be up there, man. - Yeah, right. No, I mean it, bro. You've got talent. I was on that set. I watched you, man. You're good. It's just a matter of time. Thanks, man. It's just a matter of time. Excuse me. Hi. Chuck T Soslio. - Owen. - Yeah, Owen. I saw your piece earlier. Uh, piece? Who designed your sound? Uh, me. - Hmm, great sound design. - Well, l... I liked the sound that the bugs made. Really interesting. - Well, thanks. - Yeah. Thanks a lot, man. You know, the bugs represented the guy's subconscious mind. Mm, that got past me. I run a post-production facility and a mixing stage in Burbank. Wow. That's... that's great. So, uh, did you enjoy the festival? Yeah, I enjoyed it. And they paid me two grand and sent me a first-class plane ticket to run a two-hour seminar, so joke's on them. (laughs) Did you enjoy my stint in the picture? This... this is my friend Ray. "Man 2." I don't really follow the acting or the story ever. Uh, are you based here, New York, LA? - Uh, New York, actually. - Ah. But I do work out of LA quite often. Well, if you're there on a permanent basis, - call me up. - I will do. Yeah, I definitely will. - Thanks, man. Thanks a lot. - Yeah, absolutely. I really liked the sound work and I think you've got a good future. That's nice of you to say. Where the hell have you been? Hey. I've been talking to that guy Chuck. - Chuck? - Yeah. That guy owns his own post-production house in LA. Really? He seemed like a weirdo to me. Weirdo? No no, man. He's like a top dog at this company. He wants me to come out and work for him. - Hey, buddy? - What? That guy just wanted to get busy with you. What? He did not. You're so naive, man. No no no, he gave me his card. Listen to me: When that guy looks at you, it's like a dog looking at a ham bone. He just wants to bite you and lick you all over. What the hell are you talking about? The good news is, I found these two sort of pretty little lassies that want to take us to this thing off the radio. I sense their readiness to party like it's 1999. Not me, man. I'm going back to the hotel. We all are, papi. Let's go. Let's go! (girls giggling) So you in school or... - No. - No. I mean, you know, not since high school. Yes, sir? - Good evening, sir. Room 1212, please. - Of course, sir. And could we get a couple bottles of champagne, a six-pack and a bottle of Ketel One set up there? Of course, sir. One moment. Oh! And some sandwiches, for the ladies. Yes, sir. You know, Owen here just won a major award for excellence tonight. Really? He's got job offers. - Wow! - Really? - That's so exciting. - Are you guys like movie directors? Big time. I'm actually more into design right now... No, he's a big-time movie director. We're actually both really well known. Like sound design in LA. - Like explosions? - Uh, yeah yeah. - FX, sound FX. - Wow! - That's great. - You guys ever see "Lord of the Rings"? - Yeah. - Yeah. There you go. This guy makes a fortune. - Oh my God. - Wow. - I'm an actor. - Really? Yeah. Yeah. And a musician. - Watch out for this guy! - I know. I'm a drummer. Oh my God! Are you in a band? Totally. You guys ever hear of Foghat? - No. - Really? I toured with them. Where the fuck are they with the keys? Gentlemen, would you mind? Hey. I've been instructed to have you escorted from the hotel. - Oh my God. - Hold on a second. Ray? Sir, can we just talk for a second? If you do not leave the property immediately, you will be arrested. Come on, Ray. Let's just go. Wait a minute. You can't do that. Please leave at once, or I shall be forced to contact the authorities. - Thank you, sir. Ray, come on! - Bullshit. I don't even know what the hell is going on here, okay? We are honored guests of this film festival. Would you just shut the fuck up, you idiot? Okay, but this man just won a major award tonight, so when the attorneys call, don't be too surprised. Come on! Academy Award. This is bullshit! Fucking bullshit! It ain't the Four Seasons. This place ain't even one season. You ever read the Bible? I read this thing cover to cover when I was eight years old. - (TV turns on) - Oh come on, man. This is getting really pathetic now. You're breaking every rule, buddy. She's never gonna respect you. I don't want to hear a word. What the hell are you yelling at me for? We're gonna get through this night. And in the morning, we're gonna get on a plane - and go back to New York. - Okay. - And then it's over. - What's over? Us! We're over. What, are you breaking up with me? I know it's hard for you, Ray. Okay, I know it's hard for you to understand, but this whole thing... being here... it's not a game. - It's not a fucking game. - Dude, relax. It's my life! And guess what? I'm no longer going to allow you to fuck it up. Whoa, wait a minute. How am I fucking up your life? How? Let's see. Hmm. Maybe by getting me thrown out of a hotel? Who gets thrown out of a hotel? What kind of people get physically thrown out of a hotel for saying they're Wallace Shawn's son? For posing as the son of Wallace Shawn? - It's no big deal. - Just like it was no big deal when you got me kicked out of my apartment building. Or when you got me fired from four different fucking stinking jobs. Which was the fourth? What if someone from the festival hears about this? Hmm? What if Chuck hears about it? Who cares? That guy's a loser. He's a fucking professional, a respected guy who happened to like something I did. - Do you want to know who the loser is? - Calm down. Do you want to know the definition of a loser, hmm? A loser is someone who hasn't been able to keep a job for more than three paychecks in five years. A loser is someone who consumes more hard liquor - than most bar establishments. - Whoa! Someone who doesn't know how to pay his debts or acknowledge other people's feelings. Okay, you've made your point. I don't think so. I don't think you get the point at all. - What is it then? - I happen to love that girl! What the fuck's that got to do with me? Every time I turn around, it's "Get rid of her, Owen. She's getting in your way." - I never said any of that. - Or "She's looking a little fat, Owen." Hold on, you're blaming me? Or how about this: "Did you get a permission slip to leave the house?" - I'm going to sleep. - "Ehh! Come to the party! There's gonna be all kinds of college ass there!" Oh, and you don't have a mind of your own? You're the fucking loser here. Not me, pal. You're supposed to be my friend! I'm going to sleep. I can't do it anymore, Ray. I don't want you in my life anymore. Good. Fine. That's great. That's great. That's what I get for trying to help you sort out your life. My life? What about sorting out your own screwed-up life? - That's enough. - Giving me relationship advice! What the fuck do you know about relationships? You haven't been able to sustain one for more than 15 minutes. Whatever. You have finally managed to alienate anyone - of any importance in your life. - Give me a break. Your entire family, Mary and now me. Hmm? Next it'll be your kid, if you haven't already. - Hey. - And what about her? You ever stop to think about her or are you just too busy? You don't have any fucking idea. - I know the whole story. - You don't know shit. Some bozo from LA gives you his business card and you think you're Steven fucking Spielberg. You know what? Here's some advice for you... Oh, this ought to be good. Grow up! Try taking some responsibility for once in your life! Oh, thanks for the advice, smart guy. I'm gonna go sleep in the john. Start by taking responsibility for your daughter. Try doing something with your life other than becoming a drunk fucking loser like your father. (knocking at door) Woman: Housekeeping. No. No, thanks. Ray? Woman over P. A: Final boarding call for flight #77 to Los Angeles at gate #6. Flight #77 to Los Angeles ready for immediate departure at gate #6. I need to get on this flight! - Do you have a ticket? - Yeah. I have a ticket to New York, but I don't want to go there. See, I can't go back there. Okay? I need to get on this flight. Okay? So please... Uh, look man, I don't have a lot of time. Okay? Here's my credit card. Here's my ID. Please. Round trip or one way? One way. (horn beeps) Hey, Raisin. Come here, you. (dog yipping) Hey, Raisin, get lost. Raisin? - What the hell are you doing here? - I was driving by in a cab, saw you sitting there. Well, how are you? Good. Busy. Good. - I've been going kind of non-stop. - Right right. - That's why I haven't been in touch. - Totally totally. - Things have been crazy for me too. - I'm sure. - I've been meaning to call you. - Me too. I can't believe I saw you sitting there from a cab. Yeah, I know. What are the chances? What the hell's been going on? Just busy with all this commercial work. So things are good then, huh? Yeah, you know. Just directing a bunch of commercials. Yeah, I heard you did some pizza ad. Uh, yeah, a spot. I think I saw it come on when I was watching the Knick game. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. I was like, "Holy shit." - It's pretty cool, huh? - Yeah, man. Do you get paid every time they play that thing? Um... it's sort of like that. Awesome. How about you? Same shit, pretty much. - How's the band? - The band is no more. No shit? The record companies weren't exactly banging on the door. Yeah, but you guys were good, though. I mean... And it began to occur to me that perhaps the only reason I was playing in a band was to be around women and booze. Who needs a band for that, right? Right. So I'm selling advertising space down at "The Voice" now. I know. 9:00 to 5:00. Who'd've thunk that? Well. You look great. I'm off the sauce. Really? Yep. That's great, man. Yeah. Yeah, it feels good. Shit. - I gotta get to this meeting. - Yeah yeah. I'm only in town for this one day for this meeting... No problem. No problem, bro. I understand. - Let's keep in touch. - Definitely. - It was great seeing you. - You too. And you know, congratulations on everything. Thanks, buddy. Hey. Hey. I, uh... I didn't exactly just happen to see you from a cab. I mean... Yeah, I thought that sounded kind of strange. I was sort of hoping to bump into you. It seems like I'm always expecting to bump into you. I wanted to say... to tell you, you know... face to face. I'm... I'm sorry about... I didn't... I didn't mean for it to end that way between us. You don't have to worry about that now. It's forgotten. - I said some things... - I had it coming. I said some things I'm sorry for... I'm really sorry for. I'm sorry too, you know, for all that stuff with Lynne. No, it had nothing to do with you. I'm sorry about it anyway. You ever see her around? No. You still thinking about her? Yeah. Let's don't. I think about you a lot. It's funny how things go, right? I always thought we'd be old men still meeting up every day. Me too. How's the little girl? Aw, she's great, man. She's sharp as a tack just like her mom. The best thing is, she makes life a lot less lonely. How are things with Mary? Aw, they're not too bad. As hard as we've tried over the years, we just can't seem to get free of one another so... Maybe you shouldn't. Who knows? Well, now I'm really gonna be late. Hey, get a move on there, cowboy. Yeah. You know, sometimes... I feel like I can't make it. I really feel like I just can't make it, you know? What are you talking about? Sounds like you're doing great out there. Every time I turn around I see that pizza ad. It's not an easy place. People don't exactly reach out, you know? It's not an easy place to be happy. Hey, I got news for you, pal: Every place is like that. I don't know. Sometimes I just feel like I should come back. You should come back? Yeah. I don't know, set something up here. Hey, listen to me: You're getting the chance to do something you've always wanted to do and they're paying you to do it. Most people don't get to do anything that they want in this life. - Well... - Hey, look at me. Don't expect it all to come at once, man. Stay out there. Of course it's gonna be tough at first, but it's all gonna come to you. Trust me. I could always count on you for one hell of a pep talk. Yeah, well you always worried way too much. Ah, this is true. I better go. Hey! Everything's going to be okay. Daddy! Who's that man? He was an old friend of mine. Where's he going? I don't know. Come here. Hey, I love you, you know. Hey, what do you say we go get Raisin and go home, huh? Go on, find that little mutt. Daddy? How many people would you say there are in the whole world? Wow. I would say a whole bunch. Would you say a hundred million zillion? Yeah. I'd say something like that. - Daddy? - Yeah? Where will I be living when I grow up? Sweetheart, you can live anyplace you wanna. Daddy? I don't want to grow up. Well, someday, you're gonna change your mind about that.
