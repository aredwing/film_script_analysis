Here you have quite a nice view. Thank you! For what? For this. You know I met a girl on the boat coming over, In America, every female under 50 calls herself a girl. Really? Who cares. Anyway, this girl on boat was waiting. For what? She was going to Europe to find something That was way back in the back of her mind. Part seeing things and getting some culture that was about here. Perfume about here, let it loose for once about.... We won't go into that, but.... way back, way way back in the back of her mind was something she was looking for.... What? A wonderful, mystical, magical miracle. To do what? Beats me. I guess to find what she's been missing all her life. Well. I better take a shower. Yes. Gallaria at Dermania and the church of.. What is it? They're all alike to me. You should see the Bianelli. Pardon? That's the big artist. If I have one more look at a painting, I yip. Excuse me, but Mrs. Yaeger's husband is an artist. Oh, well, say, Pardon me, ma'am. I don't understand pictures, and I got bad feet to to standing. I know how you feel. When I first fell in love with Andy, I just had to get to like pictures. So I looked and looked, and one day wonderful thing happened. I knew what I was looking at. Kind of. Would you have seen any of Dieaga's painting? He had a one-man show in New York. He sold the painting to the Toledo Museum. You must be very successful. Successful?! That show was four years ago. Well, come along. Don't go. Let's have a drink. I like to but this nonsense is wrecking my digestion. Pardon me, no disrespect for Tanniea. You're always on the same line. How to make friends and influence people. I'm sure he didn't know what he was saying. Of course he didn't. He is insensitive man. Has no heart. Not much. He is one fool with miserable belly. He probably likes French food. I must say I did. It's so refined. In ltaly, you sit down to eat and eat a meal. In Paris, you sit down, what do you eat? A sauce. In America, buy Mac, whatever it is, he sits down, What does he eat? Birds, only birds. And you want me to get excited about a man like that? Good-by. Have a drink. No, thank you. Drago? Is that right? Right. C'mon, we gotta get going. Cookie, have a drink. That will do you good. No thanks. Drago before you go? No, we're late for dinner. We take you up on that drink, though. Sure. Well, that leaves us. Or does it? I guess it doesn't. I'm dining with an old friend. Would you care to come with us? No, thank you. When in ltaly, you should meet ltalians. Mr. Ferstino is in the government. Please join us. Two is a company. A sad sin. Mr. Ferstino and I are, for several years now, We've been unexcited. Well, pardon me. Sure you won't have a short one? I don't want it. Thank you. May be I can persuade my self. Drago? How do you pronounce that? There are two people back in the states I wish to hear. They're darling couple. Rather like the Yaegers, really. Only older. Not older than me. Nobody is older than me. I am. In ltaly, age is an asset. If it is, I'm loaded. Now you do have to go. Are you sure you're not come with me? No, thank you. Okay. There is no holding me. I guess I'll have dinner by myself tonight. Don't let you on a rush. No, indeed. After sunset, she rushes around like American. She has a friend, Alfredo, All day long, she is only recuperating herself from the night before. I should be so sick. You know, Miss. Hudson, those miracles, they can happen sometimes. But you must give a little push to help. I'm not used to say things like that. Gondola, lady? Are you looking for something, lady? No, no. Not today. Tonight. Not today, not tonight. Tomorrow night is better than tonight. Look, you be a good boy and run along home. Home? I got no home. You mean you got no place to live? I live in a boat. Postcard, lady? Okay. You take this and get some food with it Some good nourishing food. The famous Piazza. Don't change a thing. Not one thing. Waiter. Smile, Lloyd, smile. Well, I'm off. Where you're going? Shopping. Buy myself, cookie. Some for me? I gave you yesterday. Give me a cigarette? You're too little to smoke. But I smoke. Not with my help. Just one cigarette. You know a sucker when you see one. Easy does it. Thank you. You okay, lady. So long, cookie. Does anyone here speak English? Yes. I wonder if you can tell me the price of that red goblet in the window? One minute, please. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. I want to ask the price of this goblet. For this? 1 0,000 liras. It is aging. May l? Please. It is very beautiful. It is a very beautiful color. Perhaps you'll see the color better if you took off your glasses. Are you enjoying Venice? Yes, I have, very much. Thank you. It is heart of Venice to catch some. Yes, I felt that. You feel Venice. That's a wonderful feeling. Have you a pair? Two? No, I'm sorry. This is the only one I have. How much did you say it was? To you, 1 0,000 liras. It is genuine. Wrap it up. I'll take it. You take it? At this price? That is the price isn't it? Excuse me, Miss. Have you bought many things in ltaly? No, I havn't. This is the first time. I just came yesterday. Forgive me. But in ltaly, you must not say so quick" I take it." You must bargain. Why? It is a part of buying and selling. I'll give it you for 8,700 liras. No, you don't. Why? Because it's not fair. But I want to. Yes, but I bought it for 1 0,000 lira. Then I give it to you for buying in ltaly. Well, I give in. I mean, I give up. Thank you. Very good. I'll wrap it up. You'll wrap it up. Thank you. Will you be staying long in Venice? That depends. I mean...I feel if I can stay forever. That is a fact what it says. By the way, if it were possible to get another goblet, Would you wish to have it? Oh, yes. I think it is possible I may find one. Perhaps you would call again? Or perhaps I could send it to your hotel? Where you're staying? In Venice. What? I mean, in Pensioni Fiorini. Oh, yes. Thank you. Hope to see you again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Your glasses. You'll wear it or carry it? Carry them. Thank you. Good-by. Good-by. Dearest Ben and Betty: Venice is as unbelievable as fairy tale, How I wish you're here. This time, we'll be a quartet.

Stand over there. Don't move and shut up. Go ahead. Now. Stop. Ok. You should've seen me in the Olympics. Skip it. Mauro! Mauro! Here, lady. Take me home. Ok, lady. Good afternoon. How are you? Not so bad. I fell into the canal. Oh yes, I'm so sorry. You played hooky this afternoon. I played hooky? I was at your shop. Didn't the boy tell you? Yes. Yes. He is very kind. He is my niece. Nephew. Nephew. Of course. Just when I think I speak English like the American, something happens. Anyhow, he is the son of my eldest sister. Bravo! That about concludes my entire performance in ltalian. Should I call somebody for you? Who? I don't know. Mrs. Fiorini? I scarcely know her. Do you want to go somewhere? No. I came to see you. Oh, you found another goblet. No. Unfortunately, no. There are not many old goblets in Venice any more. But we'll look. Don't go for any trouble. For you? It is no trouble. May we go in? Sure. It's very hot. Yes. That's better, isn't it? Mr. Rossi, why did you come to see me? It is of nature. You don't give up something you like. No. So I came. Why? Does it matter why? You knew I would. I did not. How can I explain? May be it's my English. May be it's mine. Listen. Two nights ago I went to Piazza St. Marco. You were there. We looked. Next day, you were in my shop. We talked about glasses. We talked about Venice. But we were not speak about that. Are we? So last night I was in St.Marco again. You were at St. Marco again. Half of Venice are at St. Marco again. But half of Venice are not in my shop, or I'll be a rich man. I wanted to buy another glass. That's all There are shops all over Venice. Did you looking at any of them for your glass? No. You see? But you said you'll find one for me. That's why you came back? Yes. Not that reason. I don't know what your experience has been with American tourists. My experience has been that tourist have more experience than l. Can we sit down? No. I've offended you? Oh, yes. You're sorry I'm here. Then you're glad? It may be so to you, but I'm not an ltalian. I'm an American, I thought everything happens so fast in America. Not this sort of thing. Not to me. Yes. I have offended you. Mr. Rossi, I'm not a child. But I don't understand. Understand? Why must you understand? The most beautiful things in life are those we don't understand. As we spoke yesterday, I knew you're simpatico. Is that something you understand? Yes, it means I'm like a sister to you. I have four sisters and I'm not looking for another. Stop. You can make a joke. You make many jokes but inside. I think you can. That's why you're simpatico. Miss. Hudson, you ask me why I came to see you. Because you attract me. Why? Because you do. You Americans are even more suspicious than French. Listen. We saw each other. We like each other. This is so nice. How can it be wrong? Would you do me the honor of seeing me this evening? Hello! Miss. Hudson. What a day we have. We've been shopping. No, let them guess. This is Mr. Rossi. Mr. and Mrs. Mcllenny. How are you? Fine, thank you. It's so nice to be ltalian in ltaly. Glad to know you, Mr. Rossi. How do you do? It's hot. I guess we kind of overrun our schedule. What did you buy? Glass, glass and more glass. She even sent home a chandelier. And before that, we did the glass factory, picture gallery, the whole works. The pictures were marvelous you tell them. Yes, she is right. That place certainly sold me art. It gotta be fine art. Oh, yes. That you gotta see, Miss. Hudson. Come rain or snow, you gotta see. Oh boy, pictures. Rooms full of pictures. Hundreds of pictures. All done by hand. And the cuttest glass. C'mon, I just gotta show you. Over there, so pretty, Lloyd. What are they? Benetian glass. Please don't bother to unwrap it. It'no bother. I'll show you one. And you gotta do this please. You stand right there and watch them They put this stuff on long poles and they heat it to the furnace. And presto change glass! And such colors. You have no idea. There! Isn't that exquisite? Stunning! Oddly enough. I was looking for one just like it. They're only too happy to make them for you. I bought half a dozen. They practically making them for you while you stand there. If I may ask, how much did you pay? Not too much. Lloyd, honestly. You know they wanted 1 1,500 lira a piece But you never give them what they want. You just beat them down every time.... I'm terribly sorry. No, ltalians love to bargain. How much did you pay finally? Well, 1 0,000. It's fair. Oh we missed something. We never got around the National Library. We can get that over with in morning before we catch the train. Sometimes I think the schedule in Venice is just, well, all wrong. There you go. Why! Thank you. (ltalian) I know a little shop where Mrs. Mcllenny could've saved 7,800 lira. I didn't say your glass which was made yesterday. Of course not. It was 1 8 century, cookie. Do not call me cookie. It's politer than some other names that come to mind. Now you're angry. No. Suspicious again. Angry, no. Suspicious, yes. You can always find something to be suspicious of. Well I can and this doesn't help. Suspicious..... What do you want me to do? Benetian glass the same design used over and over for years and years. Your goblet is aging centuries. You can't believe me, you're not. Now please, believe me. If you do me the honor of taking confidant tonight? There is a concert tonight. Would you like to go? He is beginning music with someone. Relax. Relax and the world is beautiful. Take a deep breath. There. There is not very much to have confidence in me, is it? No. What happens after that.....happens. Does not happen. This is all and more than I ever dreamed of. Back in Akron. You're a surprising person. Surprising? Uh-hum. Every woman should surprise a man at least once How many times have I surprised you? I think you surprise me all the time. Sometimes, you surprise me. Pleasantly? Well.... Here is, to many pleasant surprises. Which flower do you prefer? Which one do you think I should have? Choose. I think I know which one you choose You do? Perhaps I might surprise you. Perhaps. Choose. Perhaps not. Surprised? I'm afraid so. Thank you. Which flower did you think I would choose? The rose? the carnation? Oh, dear, I should've known. For once, I wasn't the touring American. Why did you choose that flower? I once went to a ball. Not just the ordinary dance, but a real ball. It was the first one I ever been to. Somehow, I got it into my mind that I had to wear gardenia. I don't know why. I guess I read about gardenia in a book or something. I must have it. I didn't even know what to wear. Did you wear one? Gardenias turned out to cost two dollars a piece. And the boy I was going with was still in college. It was nice theme. Well, now you have your gardenia. Yes. Everything happens sooner or later. Yes. That's what they say. Everything happens to him who waits. Let's take a walk. Alright. That's where I was born. You see the window? With a basket of flowers? Oh, yes. Sixty four steps up. I used to count them. That was a lot of steps. It's still is. I went back there a year ago. What are they doing? Is it a festival or something? No. They're just having fun. They'll have supper somewhere on the canal. They'll sing songs. Look the stars, and perhaps, Well, it is dark on the canal. I'll catch it from the steps. It doesn't matter. Oh, Renato! You're home. Say it again. Say what? My name. Why did you do that? Why! Yes. Why did you do that? Like that. I don't think I want to see you again. You don't? Oh, but l...... I love you. Tomorrow. Eight. Hey!

I see. Why? Why? I was afraid. I was afraid if you knew too soon, It'll end us before we begin. Now, I'm afraid I was right. No wonder you approve of that sort of thing. Approve? What Ms. Fiorini does is not my business. She leaves, I leave. I approve of leaving Pretending everything is fine and dandy, Just because you want to do it. You Americans get so disturbed about sex. We don't take it lightly. Take it, don't talk it. My wife and I don't live together. Why? Why? It is an arrangement. Does your wife have friends? Naturally. Gondola friends? No. You're shocked. No. Disappointed. No. Shocked. Your sense of humor is coming back. Good. I'm sorry, yours is leaving. Listen to me. Stop. You behave like a schoolgirl. What my wife does is none of your business. What Ms. Fiorini does is none of your business. You come here and what you do? You ride in gondola, Oh Venice, so beautiful, so romantic. Oh, these ltalians, so lyrical, so romantic. You dream of meeting someone you want. Young, rich, witty And unmarried, of course. But me, I'm a shopkeeper. Not young. Not rich. Not witty And married, of course. I'm a man and you're a woman. Don't you see? It's wrong. That's the way it is. You're like a hungry child. Was given ravioli to eat. No, you say, I want beefsteak. My dear girl, you're hungry. Eat that ravioli. I'm not that hungry. We're all the time, Miss. Hudson. There is noise in your head. Be quiet. Let it happen. I want it to happen. I want it to happen. Don't you think I do? Then? It's just..... Isn't the way I thought it would be. I'm sorry. But l...come from such a different world, and I'm not Going to be here long. So it is better to take home when you have it.

You promised to take me to see sights and now it's too late. I'll take you tomorrow. You promise? No. Now, do you promise? It is difficult. If you don't, I'll never kiss you again. Yes, you will. Yes. I guess so. They're getting to know us. You asked them to play it. I did. You're far away. I'm very close. What are you thinking? I was thinking the first evening I came here. First time I saw you, you were wearing that yellow tie. I don't want to forget any of it. Not a single moment. I don't think I ever shall. I could go for a little walk. Take us somewhere quiet. Somewhere that is you. I think you're going to surprise me again. Listen, Renato. I'm leaving today. I'm all packed. My train leaves in two hours. I don't believe you. You have to believe me, because it's true. What have I done? Nothing. What made you change your mind? Well...I hadn't a mind change. Really, I just found it. I haven't made you unhappy. No. You haven't. It's the happiest time I had in my whole life. You must believe that, please. Why throw it away? Because we have to. Because it's wrong. Because you and l will only end in nothing. I love you, Jane. You don't have to say that. I mean it. I shall always love you. Yes. If I go..... All my life, I stayed at parties too long, because I didn't know when to go. Now with you, I've grown up. I think I do know when to. I can't bear it if you go today. I can't bear it, either. Just a few days. No. I couldn't. Then I never go. Please. No. Take me to the station.
