I'm really tired so we can talk about it tomorrow. I've been so worried. I thought something had happened. I get scared. There's no reason for that. It was just a misunderstanding.

I have asked the entire neighbourhood if anyone wanted to help. But no. This for that, right? - Yes, of course. Well, let's have a look. I have collected some material that you can borrow to look at. There is some different stuff here. About both beach and city life. It is a beautiful country and the people are incredibly sweet. They're beautiful. It is easier to make contact with them down there. Take it home and look at it. Give me a call if you want to join me for a trip there. Can you turn that off? Can you turn it off? What? - My offer from this Friday no longer stands. Just so you know. - Okay. That's fine. You're actually not really my type. - Okay. Fair. Bye. - Bye. I'm thinking about going to Germany next week. To Germany? - Yes. Why so? - There is a competition there. You've not said anything about that. - That's why I say it now. Well that's nice. Where is it in Germany? - Dsseldorf. How long will you be there? A week. Maybe a little more. You also have some duties at home, you know. I've lost my appetite. Mom? I made breakfast. Will you please come out? Mom? Aren't you going to say goodbye? - I am tired. So you won't even say goodbye properly? Goodbye. You have reached Ingrid and Dennis Petersen's answering machine. We are not home at the moment. Leave a message at the tone. Hi, Mom. It's me. I just wanted to call and say, I made it down here in one piece. I had hoped to get hold of you, but ... I'll call again later. Well I'll see you. I love you. Hey. You have reached Ingrid and Dennis Petersen's answering machine. We are ... Hello? Hey. Hey. Is that you there? - Yes. How did it go? It was alright. Did you win anything? Oh. I placed 6th, So it was pretty disappointing. Well ... I am sorry to hear that. You've got a tan. Yes. I went to a tanning salon. I called a few times. - Well ... I was actually a little worried. - There's no reason for that. I'm glad you're well. You too. Hey. - Hello. Are you Dennis? Yes, I am. - This way. How much is it? - 4000 plus consumption. And three months up front. This is the bedroom. - Yes. It would be easy to split it up to make room for a children's room. Yes. Nice view, huh? - Yes. Yes? Do you have time to talk? Now? - Yes. Yes. Okay. There is something I need to talk to you about. I didn't go to Germany. I've went to Thailand. That's why I have a tan. What? I went down there, because ... I had talked a little with Bent. He told me that it was easier to find a girl. So he told me where I had to go and such. It's actually managed to find a girl. Her name is Toi. We're together. That is not funny, Dennis. I'm sorry I lied to you. Can you please leave? Can you please leave now? Mom ... Can you please leave when I tell you? Get out! Out! Get out of here. Out! Sit down. What do you expect will happen now? I don't know. Is she your girlfriend? Yes. Tell me about her. There is not much to tell. I met her down there. Have you slept with her? - Mom, I don't want to talk about that. We have never acted like this towards each other before If you can lie like that to someone, do you really love them? One thing is that you have been sex tourist in Thailand ... Do not interrupt me. One thing is that you have been sex tourist in Thailand ... That's fucking gross. Is that the kind of man you are? And you lied to me. Everything You have said, was one big lie. I know. Do you even think about what you are doing, when you treat me like this? How much you are hurting me? I'm sorry. As you can probably understand, I can not accept this. I can not accept this relationship, and I insist that you stop it at once. Can we agree that you are going to end the relationship Yes, we can. Fair. Then I think we should try to move on - and forget about your mistrust. You hurt me so much. Imagine that you could treat me like that. Sorry. Fucking gross. Hey. - Hey. Hey. - Hey. Did you have fun? - Yes. Did he like the gift? - Yes. He was very happy. I hope you have a little appetite left. - I do. Hey. - Hello. What are you doing here? I thought you were at the gym. I was, but I just had to buy a few things. I didn't think you had time for that. Well I don't, really. Who is this? Well this is Aois sister. She is visiting from Thailand. She lives with Aoi and Bent. Oh. I didn't know that. So ... You're shopping underwear? Yes, we are. I think we're going to have to leave now, mom. Dennis! Is it her? Is it her? Answer me! Is it her?! Mom? What happened? How long has she been here? That's none of your business. You're just like your father. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. I knew him. You didn't. When is she going back? She isn't. I'm moving. Huh? You heard me. I would never let you down like that ... - Mom, stop it. You can't. Don't leave me. END Lyrics: Lisa Schou Kristiansen Danish Video Text Danish texts: Tina Schaefer
