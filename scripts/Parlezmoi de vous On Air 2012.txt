Then Mlina and I choose. That way we don't have 4 people talking about premature ejaculation. They're also part of the crew. The aging Romeo's Andr. He's the producer. Next to him's Bertrand, the sound engineer. Is Mlina here? She comes a few minutes before the show. Before, she's in her dressing room. Careful, naturally don't take any photos. She doesn't want her picture spread around. Yes, I know. She won't allow it. I'm anxious to see her. She must be wonderful. I'll tell you more later. Good evening everyone. This is Mlina for "Frank Talk with You". I'm all yours for two hours, to listen to your secrets. We're here to take your calls at 3712 until 10 p.m., or on our Internet site fty@radiofrance.com. I'll take our first caller, Lucie. Lucie from Lorient. Good evening, Lucie. How old are you? I'm 13 years old. I'm listening. I'm calling because I... I'm 5'8". Goodness, 5'8" is really tall. Yes. Is that why you're calling? Yes. Being 5'8", you must already look like a woman. Because boys, even men, stare at me all the time and hit on me. It's a bit early, isn't it? Yeah. How do you feel about that? I'm not into it, but my friend says I'm a fool, I could date the cutest guys at school. And the boys in 9th grade, when I say no, either tell me I'm a child or a coward. They try to touch me. You want to go out with them? I don't know. No. You don't know if you want to or not? You should follow your feelings. - Understand? - Yes. You may look like a woman, but you needn't behave like one. Remember you're 13. Yes. If you don't want to date 9th graders, let them have 9th grade girls. And you date boys your age. What do you think? Yes. Thanks, Mlina. Bye, Lucie. Feel free to call again. Mlina! Here's this week's mail. Still sure you don't want it delivered? Are you OK, big boy? Did you have a nice evening? You didn't like me? What did I say? Yes, you did. My treasure. On Wednesday, Mrs. Gregorchk will do the cleaning. Be nice to her. She's great. Shall we have a cigarette? Snowball, are you coming? Snowball, come. It's so beautiful. Come on. Let's go in. Yes, hello? Yes, it's me. Are you sure this time? Walter Agency Investigation and Inquiries Hello, Madam. There's an envelope for me: Claire Martin. Here. Thank you. Subject: Identity Search Following your request, find below: Jolle GOULAIN, Montmirail, Marne. Divorced. Age 66, residing 35 rue des Pinsons, Claye-Souilly Turn left. You've reached your destination. I see you're 60. You've got a life ahead of you. You can still have a fulfilling sex life. So I'll pack his bags. You can meet a young lover. It's not just movie stars who meet guys 25 years younger. Not too young. Then someone your age: 60. You can travel, have a ball... screw all day. Sure, why not? Yeah, I'd like that. No need to suffer. That's a good idea. I'll do it. Don't put up with that situation. Emancipate yourself. Thanks, Mlina. Goodbye, Josiane. Bye, thanks. Now we're talking to Aline, from Verdon. Good evening, Aline. Good evening, Mlina. Well... I'm calling because my ex left me a year and a half ago. Yes. Sometimes we meet for a cup of coffee. I think we can start something serious again. I'd like to get back together with him... Go to bed with him, but I dare not say it. So after your love affair, you developed a friendship? Yes. - You don't dare tell him? - No. That you'd maybe like to try again? That's right. Are you afraid of rejection? I'm afraid he'll abandon me again, like last time. When you're abandoned once, it's not easy to face a second abandonment. On the other hand, isn't it better to dare to say it, and in so doing, maybe resolve your childhood wounds. The abandonment that hurts so deeply, is often linked to other abandonments. And rewriting the story today, being able to confront the second abandonment, is perhaps reclaiming your role as a woman. Perhaps you're strong enough today to look at things differently. I'm Claire Goulain. Claire Goulain. Jolle! I left the key. I'm going. OK, thanks. Darn it! Shit! You here for clothes? No. Is it for charity work? Yes, maybe. Come this way. Here. Let's get down to work. Stand there and sort: Men, women, children. Does Jolle work for you? Jojo... you know her? A bit, I guess. She works with the stock. Now she's retired, she works three days a week. We're all retired women. Why set aside these garments? They're not practical. People have other concerns. Why? Why would people in need not want to be sexy? You're right. I'm an idiot. You said it. They put ideas in our head, and we don't realize. What line are you in? Human resources. Human resources! You're classy. I'm not a dyke or anything, but you're a pretty gal. Thanks. Hi, Lucette. Hello. You OK? I've an invitation for you. Julie did them. Saturday's my birthday. - Thanks, I'll drop by. - I'd like that. - Are you new? - Yes. She started today. - You can come too, if you want. - No, I never go to parties. Really? Take it anyhow. Only idiots don't change their mind. Have a good day. Bye, Lucette. See you Saturday. That's Jolle's grandson. The woman you asked about... Jolle Goulain. Is that her grandson? Well, not exactly, because Jolle's son is with a woman who already had 2 kids. He's the elder. So... Saturday, October 27 Help us blow out Lucas's 27 candles Hi there. Lucas invited me. - Put your things here. - No. I'll keep them. Really? Even your hat and gloves? Yes. I'll go and get him. Lucas, you've got a guest. Hi. So you came after all. Happy birthday. You didn't have to bring a gift. Lucette just left. It's no big deal. - Is this your house? - My mom and stepfather's. That's my mother. Beside her is my stepfather. Behind him is my grandmother, actually my stepfather's mother, Jolle. She works for the charity too. Jolle? Where? Over there. In the blue pullover. - I'll introduce you. - No! I'd rather have a drink first. What would you like? Whatever. Fashion... It's vulgar. We don't give a damn. I got you a tequila. Is that OK? Perfect. You're not too bored? Not at all. - What's your name? - Claire. - I'll introduce you. - No, don't... My best friend, Rmi. We swam together. I won't shake hands. I'm catching bird flu. I'm afraid you'll get it. That's my... Come on. That's my mother... my mom. Claire. She's new at the charity. Hello. Welcome. Aren't you hot in that? I'm getting a flu, and maybe herpes. Really? Luck's not on your side. No. You're so pale. Want something to eat? No, nothing homemade. Really? If you want something, just ask. Or help yourself. Feel free. Thanks. You're lucky your mom's so considerate. Yeah, but she tells our life story on the radio. He's criticizing me again! I listen to Mlina, the Radio France personality. Talk to your husband, not to that bitch. I'm the grandmother. Hi. That's irrelevant. Hello. I don't know her, so I can talk to her. You really have no pride. Last time, she gave me good advice. - Telling her about us... - That's kids for you. They criticize us and don't understand. No introductions? Bernard, my stepfather. Claire. Hi. Hello, sir. For once, it's not someone colored. Spouting shit again! Don't start fighting again. I'm going out. If not, I'll lose it. Damn you, Bernard! How are you? Things going well? Why wouldn't they be? All these people must be an inconvenience. No, I love parties! Did you do all the cooking? No, I just made the pancakes. That's all I can make. Kids love them. You don't have kids? No. That's smart. They're such a pain. Take, Bernard, for example. He really made me suffer. As a kid, he didn't listen. So stubborn. After, things got a bit better. Now he still depends on his mom. Yes... throughout their lives. It doesn't surprise me. Do you have other kids? No, one was enough. I was on my own. You raised him yourself? Yes. You know how men are. All that's behind me now. Yes, it's behind you. My sweetie pie, what are you eating? Some candy. Candy? You didn't eat my pancakes? Yes, I did. - How many did you have? - Two. - You like grandma's pancakes? - I love them. You're the most beautiful, the best... Getting some air? Tell me... Are you single? Why are you asking? Since you're on your own, I thought... Excuse me. Wait a second. Leaving already? Don't you want to dance? No, I'd rather go home. I didn't open your gift. Never mind, you'll open it without me. Drive carefully. Mlina, it's Andr. I just got the numbers. We beat our record. We crossed the 10 mark. Isn't it terrific? I don't know... maybe we can celebrate for once. Can you hear me? What the hell do I care? As Arletty said, my ass is international. She slept with a German in WWII, and that was her reply to her critics. Still listening to that stuff? Night-night, Granny. Night, sweetie. You really have to experience that passion. Call me when you're with a guy with a moustache. Radio France Identity Card Good luck with your pregnancy, and also good luck if you decide to abort. Not an easy decision. It's time to say good night and bring you the news with Christophe Levalier. As usual, I'll enjoy talking with you tomorrow as of 9 p.m. Thank you for listening. NO SALESMEN Hello. Hello. Is this Claire Martin's place? Yes, but she's not here. Tell her Lucas from Claye stopped by and give her this. Thanks. Hello. What are you doing here? I was at your place and left your badge. Really? Thanks. - May I sit down? - No! Sorry, someone's joining me. Hello, will you be eating? Sure, why not. I'll sit here. It's classy. Hope it's not too pricey. Here's the menu. So Mrs. Martin's waiting for a guest? Yes. A Parisian volunteering in the suburbs? Yes, because... I'm moving to Claye soon. Really? Where? I don't know yet. Maybe near rue des Pinsons. That'll make a change. Yes. Radio France is moving or you got a new job? Your badge... Isn't it Radio France? What would you like? I'll take menu A and a beer. Thanks. I can't imagine you in Claye. You're not a journalist on assignment? Writing on the suburbs... Unemployment? Volunteers? No. Absolutely not. Really? Why do you say that? I dunno. Just a feeling. Are you a detective or in construction? Construction? The plaster under your nails. Oh yeah. It's not my real job. I do it for the money. What's your real job? I did photography, but dropped it. Why am I even telling you? Why'd you drop it? I couldn't make a living. It's hard to break in, and it's not my world. So what, if it's not your world. The art world isn't art. The art world is a market. It's not the same. If you're not in, you can't break in. You can do anything if you really want it. Easy to say when you live in the 16th. What do you mean? What do you know about it? Maybe your photos are the problem. Maybe. Want to see? I picked them up from the gallery. Yes. Why not? OK. Here. Thank you. Who are those people? Strangers. I take pictures of people I don't know. You never take your family? No thanks. You must like them if you live with them. Except for your stepfather, obviously. He doesn't seem worth knowing. Disliking your stepfather is typical. don't like their biological parent's new partner. If you say so. I don't get along with the others either. I never see my dad. My mother's nice, but a bit stifling. Jolle and I hardly talk. If I hadn't left my place, I wouldn't be there. I'll be leaving to go abroad soon anyway. How lucky to have a family! You think? Of course. Lots of people would envy you. What's so great about a family? Ever read the news? Open your eyes? I've got to go! I'd love to talk more, but I must work. Your guest didn't come? No, he didn't come! Is that a problem? No problem. It's none of my business, but I'd like to say this: I know something about photography. It would be a shame to stop. What I saw was high quality. You've got talent. You should persevere. That's it. Sure she's coming? Yes, I'm telling you she'll be here. I went to Aldi... I'm here! Here she is. Sorry, but I had the kid. So you shop at Aldi? I go to Lidl, but they're getting pricey. Prices are going up and up. Hello. Hi. We know each other. Let's get on with it. We've a new load and the Easter eggs. Can I do something not involving contact with clothes? I'm allergic to dust, fibers and plastic. That doesn't leave much. You can just watch. Just joking. You can list the stock. Where's this crate from? I brought the green one up yesterday. It's for food aid. We'll do it tomorrow. I'll call city hall for the Easter egg operation. Maybe I can join you? It doesn't take two to make a call. Jojo, is the red car yours? Oh no! Have you lost your mind? I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry. I misjudged the space. I just got new glasses. I don't give a damn. If you can't drive, don't! I didn't think I'd hit you. I volunteer and look what it gets me! Shit! Bye. See you Tuesday. Would you like a beer? - Here. - Thanks. I sure needed that. Me too. That bitch and her car! I know you were a drum majorette. Lucas told me. I saw him yesterday. He told you that? It's true. I even made regional champion. I was crazy about it, and pretty good too. Mini skirt for the guys, a baton to sort them out. You seem like a tough cookie. I'm like you, no pushover. Otherwise people walk all over you. Are you from Claye? No, I'm from the Marne, but I left when I was barely 18. Really? Why? I had problems. No, because that's what life decided. Life? Yeah, you'll see. Sometimes... you end up in situations... you know. Do you think life decides, or people? I think it's life. - Really? - Yeah. Where are you from? Me? It's kind of unusual because, I wasn't raised by my parents... There's Lucas. - You're here? - Hello. Did you hear my car was banged up? Shit. How did it happen? A woman was reversing outside the charity association. What a pain in the ass. It knocked me out. I need to rest. I'm going. Bye. Sit down, it's more comfy. Want some cake my mom baked? No thanks. Don't worry, it's fresh. Thanks, but no! Some cookies? I'm not hungry. Whatever you say. Not sitting down? Sit by me, if you want. What are you doing? A little dusting. You're cleaning? - You think it's dirty here? - No, but... But what? It's just that... If you're uneasy, why are you here? Well, because... - Because? - Because... Because... I was invited. So there! What do you mean? I live here. Relax. I'm not relaxed. I don't need to relax. Besides I've got to go. Rocky, get down! Leave the lady alone. Rocky, down! Hello. Sorry, she's playful. Are you OK? What's going on? Rocky wanted to play. I had Bernard on the phone. He can't take you to the cardiologist. Shit, I waited two months for that appointment! What time's your appointment? You sure are punctual. Yes, always. I thought of you the other night. Ingrid was listening to her thing... You've got the same voice as that idiot on the radio. No, I'm not saying you're an idiot. No. How old were you when you had Bernard? Wasn't it hard being such a young mother? I say that because my mom had me when she was just 17 years old. I don't think it was easy. Probably not. Abortions weren't so common back then. I don't think she wanted to abort. Did you consider abortion? I don't know what I thought. Forty years ago in the country, it didn't exist. Why did you leave your home so young? You mentioned problems. You ask a lot of questions. I'm interested. I like to know about people's lives. I left because I got a job offer in Alsace. And since I couldn't make ends meet, I decided to leave everything and make a fresh start. A fresh start? Yes, a new life, a whole new beginning... Watch out. The lights! Did you leave in the late 60s? Yeah, around then. In 1967. Maybe, yes. You OK? Yes... no, I'm a bit hot. That's it. Everything OK? Yeah, OK. I'm supposed to take it easy. I've always had a strong heart. Let's go. Jolle, I've some important things to say to you. It concerns both of us. I'd like us to talk about it. Would you mind if we met elsewhere without Ingrid and Bernard? At my place, for instance. Or in a cafe, if you prefer. Yes, I'd prefer a cafe. Do you know the Parc Floral in Vincennes? Yes, a bit. There's a cafe, "Le chant des oiseaux". It's quiet. OK. Tomorrow, at 3 o'clock, would that do? Yes. Shall I pick you up? No! I'd rather not, so no one asks questions. See you tomorrow. Do you have 5 minutes? I like coming here. It was nice of you to take her. To be honest, it surprised me. You're so distant sometimes. And sometimes really thoughtful. It's strange. We all have our contradictions, I guess. We can sit down, if you like. Do you live alone? Yes, and it suits me fine. Me too. I think anything's possible. That's true. There's something I wanted to ask you... Here you are. Thank you. - How much do I owe you? - It's a gift. Normally, you don't pay for a gift. I insist on paying. It's only right. Then I'll take it back. It's a gift, not for sale. Very well, I accept the gift. Thank you. It's really very kind. I thank you. Here, Ania, it's for the month. But I've just started. It's better for you. You'll have an advance. - Thanks, Mrs. Martin. - A pleasure. Thanks, Edgar, for your story. Welcome to my next caller... Ingrid, from Claye-Souilly. Good evening, Ingrid. Good evening, Mlina. I called a few months ago about a relationship problem. But today it's about my son. He just split with his girlfriend. He's hurting, is that it? No, I think he's fallen in love again. That's wonderful. What great news. But I'm worried because he's fallen for an old woman who gets infectious diseases... Really? Hello? Sorry, a slight technical problem... - Do I go on? - Sure, carry on. When I say "old", she must be about 40-45. Since he's 27... - That's not old. - There's a big age gap. But if you think it's OK for him... I didn't say that. That's different. A big age gap is very serious! You can't! - Really? - Of course! You can't say that. He's made up his mind, you can't do much. You can always do something! You often say not to interfere, let people live... Not when their life's at stake! It's not our policy... You can't allow just anything. What sort of mother are you? You're caring, someone who looks after her child, who wants the best for him! So you must stop him now! Well, I'll try, but when he's made up his mind... Be persuasive! Find the right words. I don't know... Say it'll be another failure. He must find someone younger, his own age! But, Mlina, he's 27. So? He's 27, he's your son and you let him have his way? He's 27. He's still your son. Help him! OK, I'll do my very best. You must do your best! OK, OK... I don't usually speak like this, but you can't let it go on. This is serious. Yes. Thank you, Mlina! Goodbye, Ingrid... And keep us informed. OK. We're counting on you. My best to you. Goodbye, Ingrid. Hello, Andr. Let's meet to celebrate the record number of listeners. Naturally, with pleasure! Where? "Le Petit Ozio"? I know it! How's it going? So... to record numbers of listeners! To our record and our collaboration. What are you thinking? Nothing, I'm sorry, I... I got carried away. OK, forget it. I'm sorry, we're closing shortly. How about a last drink at my place? I don't think that... - Can I talk to you? - I'm with a friend. It's important. If the lady doesn't want to, get lost. - What's with you? - Nothing. Go in, I won't be long. Remember to take off your shoes. Can't you see I'm with someone? You who... Have you lost your mind? How can you think I'm interested in you? Have you seen yourself? You're pathetic! - Andr, I'd rather you left. - Sorry? Please... Really? OK, then. - See you tomorrow. - Yes. Maybe we're not such a bad pair. A cup of coffee, please. Mlina's True Face I imagine you're aware of this. Your private life isn't my concern, but this comes when we're investing in an ad campaign around your anonymity. I don't understand it... Your anonymity is a clause in your contract, at your request, in fact. Mlina, are you really with Andr? How can you believe that too? Mlina! Ania! Is that you, Madam? Yes. Where are you? In the cupboard. Here? Can you buy me some food? I got what you asked for, Madam. Are you OK, Madam? Yes. Can I do anything for you? No, nothing, thanks. If I may say so, Madam, I think you should try to meet people. I know you're sensitive. Don't be afraid of approaching people. What can you lose? There's no shame in reaching out. That's it. Can you hear me? I've got to go now. I've work to do. See you Monday. Hello. Can I speak to... Sorry, I'm in a hurry, Jolle's in hospital. - Really? - I'm going there now. I'll follow you. Mrs. Joubert? Please see reception. They need her papers. I've brought everything. And Lucas left this morning. Really? Yes, he suddenly decided to take his trip. I don't know why. He thumbed a ride. You know, the other evening, on the radio, when I said "an old woman..." It doesn't matter. Mrs. Joubert? It's ready. We'll fill out the papers together. Someone, usually a woman, holds a baton. She tosses it up. The higher the baton goes, the more it spins, the more fascinated we are, because we're afraid. We don't know how the woman will catch it. For a few seconds, we're afraid. We don't know if she'll catch it, or if it'll fall and be lost. It's like a separation: a woman lets go of something and we don't know if she'll get it back. I waited for you, you know. You wrote that you'd come back for me. I'm not asking for anything. Don't worry. I just want you to say... just once, you loved me, despite everything. Say it. Please. I did what I could. I put you with nuns. I couldn't cope. Yes, I know. I did that so you'd get an education. To hell with education! Say you love me! It was so long ago... Damn it, say you love me! Tell me you love me! Say it! Say it or I unplug you! No! I love you. Again! I love you! ...come back for you. Big kiss. Mommy One Year Later Good evening and welcome. This is Mlina, with the week's first program. I'm taking your calls, on 3712, till 11 p.m. or by Internet at fty@radiofrance.com. So, welcome to Anne, calling from Nice. Good evening, Anne. Hi, Mlina. I've been a faithful listener from the start. Thank you for your loyalty. I never miss a program. It really comforts me. And it reminds me of a time in my childhood... That's why I'm calling. Really? Yes. I've never told anyone about it before. I lost my parents very young. That's life. I was put in a children's home. In fact, it was an orphanage. Yes, I know. Right... I recall, in our dormitory, a girl a bit older than the others, because she hadn't been adopted. She always managed to get sent back. I think she hoped her real parents would come back for her. And in the evening, after lights-out, she'd take a big sheet and hang it from a bunk bed. All the girls gathered on one side, with her on the other. Everyone was silent. She had a radio under her mattress that she put on briefly for a jingle. Then she imitated the voices of radio presenters. You know... Yes. In fact, she became the star of the dorm. She said she'd take people's calls and we little ones fought to speak first. Taking turns, we spoke about our problems, about our little upsets. It could be anything... Yes, we had no family. We were alone, in fact. She let us talk. And I remember that with much emotion. I've never forgotten it. Sometimes I wonder what became of that girl. I hope she found happiness. Yes, let's hope so. Well, that's it. I'm sorry, I didn't call about a problem... Just about this little story. Don't apologize. It was a lovely story. I hope I'm as good as that little girl. But, if I may, Anne, I'd like to ask you... Do you live alone? Alone? Yes. Yes, and... are you happy? It depends, like everyone, I guess. Yes, of course, but... I want to say to you to reach out to others, don't be alone, go out and meet people. It's very important, because your sensitivity, which I hear and sense, proves you have a big capacity for love and it would be sad if no one benefited from it. Don't you think? Yes. Thank you, Mlina. Thank you, Anne. Thank you very much. This film is dedicated to the memory of Nadia Barentin. Adaptation: Pamela Grant
