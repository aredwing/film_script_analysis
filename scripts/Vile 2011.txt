We have to take uma decision. I'll take for us Jesus Christ! What the fuck is wrong with you? Stop!. Stop!. Stop! Get your hands off me. Get away from me! Okay, okay. -What's going on? I do not know. We were trapped here too. You do not know? You do not know? Why the fuck broke the nail my girlfriend? -The Video! -The video is shit! What video? You have to see for yourself Come upstairs. Come. Come! Come! Hello Welcome my house I apologize for the uncomfortable circumstances that brought them here But I can assure that by working together, May leave all very little time As everyone has noticed, I installed a piece of jewelry at the head of each of you. This device serves to do one thing only: Which consists in obtaining particularly certain chemicals their brains occur naturally. Unfortunately, the chemist who need They are produced only when The brain tells the body that is in danger. Pain is the only Out of this house. This will not be easy for either of you But by working together, I have confidence that find the way through this process as safely and efficiently as possible. 22 hours will be awarded to fulfill its task. The clock starts the countdown As soon as they start. Good Luck. There's your explanation. What the hell ... I'm Nick, she is Tayler, -Tony ... -Hello. Sam, Greg, Julian and Tara. Fantastico! We're all friends. We can find a way leaving this shit house? Already checked. It's all locked up. There is no escape. Maybe we forzarr something or knock down this door. force? force? the kitchen counter? That is, are steel plates. You can not force. There must be a way. None except the video The video is fake, right? It's just a fucking sick joke. It's true. How do you know? The chemicals in the I was talking about are: Dopamine, serotonin and adrenaline. They do drugs with these things. The video is very real. She's not lying. The drug is made to experience in people. How are we going to do? Do what? Torturing? Among us? We will not. There must be another way leaving this house. You know, people brought us. obviously has the power to stay here. They came and captured and had no possibility to resist or fight. Well, look ... How long have we been here? Who knows? Maybe have been several days. Idiot! Do you realize what have you done? Now we are here and damn you started the countdown. We have not discussed something like this before. Sorry, I was a both concerned about -Surviving, to schedule ... -Damn it! Well, the clock has started and Talk will not stop him. I can not do this. You want to take the risk to find out what happens when the clock reaches zero? We are nine, right? I'm thinking that if we separated, perhaps not so bad I do not separate myself sucks With none of you. There must be another way. I'm telling you, man, You are locked. What we been? Wait, you two know each other? -Calm down, Julian ... -You did this 'You're gonna get us killed. Do not say anything stupid This is just a house! Let me out! ! Motherfuckers! Want pain? I'll give you pain ... But you will not get nothing of me. I we do a vote, right? Who thinks to do what the girl said the tv? so we can out of here ... Raise your hand. Right? Well, let's do it then. Fuck it. -I would not do that, man. -Fuck you. I will not spend more a single second in this house. Julian! You need to be tough guy ... My God! Only needs to be a very tough guy. He's dead. There is only one option. You guys should not be men? Having a little more responsibility? You want to engage women in this? I want to live to see my son again. And if I have to torture each of the women here ... will. We are all in this together. So no trash feminism Right? Damn feminism? Son of a bitch! Who do you think you are? -Hey, stop! -Waste of feminism? Stop, stop, okay? Can we at least agree not going to discuss stop the clock? He's running. We're wasting time. Okay, but I say He might be the first. Very well. I think I'll do the honors. Shit. This is not working. Says who? We did this for an hour. We have to think of something else. Is taking too long and energy intensive. He's right ... I do not know much the subject, but ... I'm pretty sure the brain produces these chemicals of which she was talking ... All you need is ... Is it? Just ... have sex ... Ah ... please ... Now is not the time to think about that little boy. Just saying ... Well, do not do Fucking disgusting piece of shit. I'd rather be tortured. Well, then ... What do we do? Guys ... I think Greg had the idea correct after all. Listen, pal ... We will stop at 14% Is it okay? Right? Hurry up with that. Should I hit him with my shoe or something? I think we will have to be a little rough. I remember you. - How much are we? -7.5%! Almost there, friend, Hold. Almost there. Wait. He knows something not telling us. What I was saying Julian, Greg? About being a tough guy? Do you know who is doing this? Tell us what you know! I do not know ... nothing. I know nothing. Son of a bitch! No! No! What the fuck? What the fuck? Stop! Stop! Stop! Are we going to leave? No, no, no. This is not over yet. No time to waste, remember? Tell us what you know! What is your problem? Is my problem? He knows ... We voted, remember? And it was you who changed extreme methods. I changed ...? Are you crazy? You broke her leg half! Even if we allow the psychopath leave the house, how will he escape? How the hell are we going to get out of here? What the hell was I supposed to do? You said, from torturing the guy, so torture the guy, damn! He knows something and is not telling us! And remember what you said Julian? Look, we have to be smart with this. None of us want go through this. You okay? Shit. Well, be careful. Shit. When is your turn? Fuck This is not over. Who's next? I found this. Well, that's not such a good idea this is done in each at once. What do you suggest? Make like half and half. All we can end like Greg. Half or all together, nobody will cut nothing of my body. My fingers stay with me. Thank you very much. Nick is right. We'll have to get Greg from here. We can not afford any more serious leg injuries. In my opinion, I think that we should not do anything at all. If we refuse into her game, at least achieve these bastards display. Maybe it's a hoax. And if she's right? And if we do nothing? We let the clock run. We may be enough strong to fight against whoever we are doing this. No. We will not. Think We're all here. We grabbed in an open, We're supposed to fill one of these little bottles, Why the right not full? These things are sending or received a signal. Whoever we put here we can kill with only pressing a button. And never disclose their identity to us. We must act intelligently, we have to think how to overcome this, we can all leave of here alive. I agree. Yes, you're right. I guess I also agree. So now we have to Carefully torture us? Twice?? So expect this not a hoax? And then we leave free? Yes, exactly what. Is it okay for you pineapple? Do not talk that way, princess. I will not support a fuck you. Stop. Stop, right? Do not do this in a silly fight. Talk is not going to take anywhere. We have important decisions to make. For example, how do we decide who's next? We have to move forward with the plan. The clock is ticking. Talk to us we will help anything. We will overcome. With what? Come with me. Come with me. I'll go first. All right. Damn it, come on. Let's do this shit here. Come. Oh, shit. Are you going to undress? It's my favorite shirt. What the hell is all this? Not everyone was a good childhood. Is this going to work at least? Can you at least feel something? A girls like scars Wait. -Promise - What? Promise me you will not get with my genitals. Okay, Sure. Nothing genitals. I think I speak for us all when I say that I wish if they did the same. Yeah, I'm with him. I do not want anyone touch my face. Really? Are you kidding? Now is not the time of being vain, guys. Do not think I protect my ball is in vain. Sure, if you want to touch your face, we'll think of something. Seriously, what's your problem? You are my problem. Incredible. Bitch! Very well. Are you ready? Sorry, mate. Are we? We're -1.5% To finish, okay? -Come. -Use the pliers. - What? Use the pliers. Are you ready? Come on, man. Here we go. Are you ready? If. Wait, do not need this.

Can you do me a favor, man? I feel I am losing a lot of blood here. Could you bring me some gauze the other room? Sure. Nick. It's your turn. Shit! I'll go look for them, man. Do not worry. Do you think they'll let me do here? Yeah, right. Why not? He will be fine. We are now tying so ... Not so. I know Nick will be strong. I'm so scared. So do I. One must concentrate. Focus on this end. The pain will pass, you know? That is ... That's what Sam said That's what Sam said? Genial. This is wonderful. I'm just trying to help, I had not easy for me. Sorry.

Vou go for it Right? No time for this. Fuck I want to wait for my girlfriend. You have to trust me. I love you. Greg is awake. He can lift? 'Not by chance We will have to make a stretcher or something to remove it. Maybe not. What do you mean? How do we get out of here with him? is a big guy. All I'm saying is that you are right. If we get out of here, We will need all the strength we have. That is why decided to divide. -Half and half -Right What I'm saying is, we all to make our first part. Sam is not so badly injured as Greg. Sam did not have a fucking screwdriver tucked into knee, right? What you're saying is: make our halves, leave it there and do the rest of Greg? Lower your voice, He might hear you. Really? He will die. If we leave, will die. What else can we do? -Go ahead with the plan. -I agree with her. - What? No! No! No, dear ... I do not want to be like him. I can not do this anymore. I can not do. He was going to do with us Did you forget that he was he who tied us all? We agree. What? You two? Sam. What about you? Whoa! Fucking awesome. You know what? Do what you want. I'll take my portmanteau because they do not want in my consciousness. -Honey, please do not. Do not touch me. They are cowards. And because they are cowards, deserve to be here. The clock is ticking, let's end this. So ... We will continue with the original plan. Tear one more. Today is wrong to be strong. No. No, please, stop. Push the damn hole! No, please, stop. Please stop. What happened? Why not raised the percentage as the others? Not. That will happen with all of us? - Should we make it harder? -No. We need to calm down Right? Maybe it has to do with chemical balance of each. All right. You will not leave here crying. You can do it You must be strong ... No! Get away from me! I do not want to do this. Let's get it. What? No, no. Come on, we have time for this. Shut up, you fucking bitch. Just go.
