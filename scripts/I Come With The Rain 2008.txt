I have a fear of being contaminated by all sorts of things. I have an only son, whose name is Shitao. Three years ago, without any explanation He left for Asia. A year after he left, he sent me a telegram from the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. He asked me to deposit $10,000 into his account. I did so. Without question. A month later, he asked for the same amount again. This time I sent a detective A man named Vargas. Vargas searched for 6 weeks and had reasons to believe that my son was looking after an orphanage. In an area occupied by gold miners. A short while later, I received a telegram from Vargas. He said everything was fine, That I could send the money, that it was for the orphanage. I sent the money. Since then... Thirteen months have passed without any news. No means of reaching Vargas. Do you have any idea why your son left? You must understand, mr. Kline, that Main is the largest pharmaceutical conglomerate in the world. I built this empire from nothing. Through sheer force of will. Perhaps I was too hard on my son. Since he was 10 years old, I've only ever seen my boy from there. Where you are now sitting. Please, find him. You have carte blanche, mr. Kline. Spend whatever you need to spend. But please, bring me back my son. When and where will you begin your enquiry? I have another job I am finishing up in a couple of days. I guess I will start the minute after and pick it up where Vargas left off. Very well, mr. Kline. Thank you. MINDANAO, Philippines Someone swore to me that he saw three men, Hiro, Shitao and  about seven months ago. They dragged his body into the jungle and buried it somewhere. Why would they kill him? At first Shitao kept the orphanage going with money from his father. Then one morning, he shut himself up here in this room for three days without eating. When he came out... He went directly to the richest miners around. to ask them for donations. One man... Never, if anything... Saw Shitao... Sat on the ground... in front of thet man's house... And he talked... For hours and hours and hours... The man... didn't chase him away... He didn't hit him up... He said nothing to him. Then... One night... He heard him . I want your advice, Vargas... On my way here, I got a phone call. It was Shitao's father. He told me something. He has a sisters that lives in Hong Kong. Except from Shitao, she's the only family he has left. Two days ago, she went to their parents' grave And she found fresh flowers. She called her brother... Scolding him for being in Hong Kong and not calling her. When he told her he hadn't budged from L.A., Naturally I assumed it was Shitao who left flowers at the grave. - He decided to leave the evidence. - That's what I said. But they want me to go to Hong Kong and check it out. I have no reason to doubt that the person who told me he'd seen Shitao murdered by three men. But I never said anything to my employer because... I didn't have any real proof of his death... Everything points to his being dead, but.... That he's still alive. If I were you... I'd go to Hong Kong. Thanks. Here is a photo I took of Shitao. I think it's the most recent one. HONG KONG Save my boy, please, save him. Save my boy, please. Are you ok? Hi. I'm looking for Detective Ju Meng Zi. May I see your id please? Hey, how are you? - Good to see you. - Nice to see you too. What's going on? Who was that? Su Dong Po. An asshole. I'll take you to dinner tonight. Sorry, I was annoying. It's no problem. Who's complaining? Well, are you looking for a guy in Hong kong? Yeah. What have you got on him? Name, age, , a couple of photos. Give me your right hand. Christ, show me your other hand. What happened to you? You did it yourself? Come with me, I'm taking you to the infirmery. Maybe he looks totally different since the last picture was taken. Yes, possible. We'll see what the computers have to say about your man, ok? I'm restoring the house of the Lord. He is coming. He's the crazy guy who painted the . Is it Jesus? The Christ? The Buddha? The fish has to be at least 75 years old. Try it. It won't kill you. Come on. Try it. - So, good. - Ok, tell me, why do you quit the force? They made me see a shrink, that's why I quit the force. Just because of a murder... It was... He killed 24 people... He considered himself an artist... He used to make scultpures of his victims' bodies. This guy could disect his victims so quickly they were still alive. That's really disgusting. After 27 months on the case... I think I kind of... overidentified with him. Tako sam jedino mogao da Provalim ta ce uraditi sledece. I... It was the only way I could figure out what he's gonna do next. So I had to think like him, I had to live like him, and... in the end I think I got a little contaminated. Yeah, contaminated. Did you catch him? Yeah, I caught him, it was easy. It was easy? Yeah, it was easy. Because... he was ready to be caught. There were a lot of guys working on the case, but... He chose me... He chose you... He called me at 4 o'clock in the morning... He told me to come along, so I went... You went all by yourself? I went by myself and I killed him. I know what you are thinking. If you try, I'll help you. I know I cannot always count on you. I can't do it without you. Everyone has... They're all talking about this cop. This Ju Meng Zi. What about you? You think... He could make things difficult for us? You have my respect and my trust... I'm just waiting for you... To give me something to pass to the others. The ones who don't really know you. This is a gift for your wife. I know she loves crab. These are the first of the season. I promise you... Ju Meng Zi will not taste them this year. That decision... Will serve the spirits... A wise decision. Five star... Who are you working for? World's biggest pharmaceutical company... I have complete control. No credit limit. In your shoes... I wouldn't be in a hurry to find your guys. I've never slept in a 5-star hotel. Mifu, how's it going? You seemed stressed out. Gambling did get you down? I need to freshen up. Is that alright? No noises. Be quiet. Lili is sleeping. I keep him with me Out of respect for his uncle. I shouldn't. He's a hot head. Mifu? What are you up to, Mifu? You don't... I just want to cool off. Put them into these bags. Su DongPo lives around here. We're just going to drive by, see if he is still up. i think it's the street we just passed. He's dead. I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man. Su Dongpo is gonna kill me. What? He shot first. If I die with my eyes open... Will you close them for me? No, no, no... Thank you. Hey. Someone's called us on this phone. And there's still no sign of the bum that lives in the hut. What the fuck happened here? Meng Zi? - Meng Zi? - What? Look what I found. Look at the shelter, right? You may think it's a bomb shelter, but it's something else. A bum, a real one, he collects stuff, he hoardes it. He.. He adds to it. But this... This hut is clean. The guy who lives here is not a bum. He's something else... And what bothers me the most... Is that it looks just like Shitao's place in Mindanao. Wait, don't jump to conclusions, ok? Imagine... If the jacket that I saw this morning Is this jacket... Imagine... If Shitao lives here... It means that the guy I was looking for was standing directly in front of me... - Night. - Wait. Flesh. It's amazing... and flesh. I was always there. Just waiting for a great artist like Hesford to  Hesford was not an artist, mr. Kline. He was a murderer. Mr. Kline, he was a murderer. - Hello? - They are the same prints, sir. You awake? What? The same prints? The prints from the bomb with the yellow jacket in my office Are the same as the ones on the door of Mifu's car. And the same as the ones on the glass in the hut. They are the same prints. Hello? You still there? I don't understand a word you're saying. I'll be in your hotel in 10 minutes. I need a fix. Please, give it to me. In the glove box... There will be photos... You can't see his face. The cops saw on the guy's wrists. So we took him to the infirmery. The doctor took photos, but he didn't take a picture of this guy's face. Because he was interested in this weird cuts. Hey, look at this. Hey, Dungpo, what a surprise, eh? Looking for something? A dead body may be right... Or a bag full of cash... I know you are up to a  in this shit. And I will catch you, you asshole. Hello, you hear me? Do you, huh? Ok, . You will be behind bars soon. And you wanna hear the best part?
