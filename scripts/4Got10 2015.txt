Well, one thing's for sure -- The Grim Reaper had himself a good old time. Samuel... you better call this in to the city. They're gonna want to send out some CSI technicians. Don't want us small-town boys contaminatin' evidence, do they? Yes, sir. Samuel! Hold on there. Jackpot. Oh, my God. Looks like somebody tried to rip somebody off and got killed. It sure looks like it. Where you goin' now? I'm going to call it in. Why? I said, "Hold on here." With all this blow and cash, we're just askin' for trouble just being around it. Not if no one knows it. You're kidding, right? Just think about it, Samuel. That must be $3 million in cash in that van. At least that much in product in the other one. No one knows it's out here. Bullshit. Somebody always knows. Didn't your wife just have a baby? Yes, sir. I got two -- on the way to college. I don't know how the hell I'm gonna pay their tuition. Room and board. That's a lot of money, son. And I'll be honest... I'm feelin' old. I'm tired. Tired of workin' two jobs. Tired of pickin' up drunks at 2:00 in the mornin' covered in piss and vomit. Tired of getting' shot at by some crazy bitch 'cause her alimony check bounced. I'm just tired. And, son, that's a lot of money. Had you going, kid, didn't I? You son of a bitch. You almost had me. I'm gonna go call it in. Sorry, kid. Just take it easy, now. Let's talk this through. Like you did with that young deputy there? I'm not worried about him. I'm worried about you and me. Don't even try. Uh, who the hell are you? I have no idea. Fuck. Excuse me, sir. A moment? Yeah. ls that the sheriff? He's lucky to be alive. Being prepped for surgery. anything else? Agent Rocker, DEA. The second he wakes up. I need to know. You got it. Let's go piece this together - before the local cops mess it up. We estimate that nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine was brought in right beneath our noses. We're on the front line. And on the front line, we can't afford to fuck up. Breaking up these drug cartels and stemming the flow of drugs, weapons, and cash across the Southwest border is our top and only priority. I'm all ears. A shit storm in the middle of nowhere and a dead deputy. Davis, I need you on traffic cams. - Report back to me A.S.A.P. - I'm on it. - A dead deputy? - Yeah. Looks like we're missing someone. There's a vehicle missing, also. You know the make and model? I believe so. I want roadblocks on every highway, people in trains and bus stations. And check the hospitals. This man is wounded. Copy that. Take me through it. We haven't processed everything yet. I don't have half the data. Tell me what you do have. Well, right now it's all guesswork. Just...take a stab at it. I think our missing friend here caused most of the damage. He came out with a two-piece. Took out perp one and perp two. Perp three and five, they got a lot of rounds off. A lot of shooting. Nothin' hit. I think they may have hit one of their own. I'm still checking the trajectory on that. I mean, this guy, he probably dropped his piece when he was counting' rounds. - And that's... - Smart. Yeah. Well, he did take one. When perp six hit him in the chest, perp number seven made contact down below. That would explain the blood. What about the chest hit? We found a vest. Had some damage and some blood on it. So he was prepared. Or lucky. Okay, so, he was down and there were still three men standing? Clearly he cracked his head pretty good when he fell down. He was down, but not out. Not immediately. How long before we have a more complete ballistics report? 24 hours. Maybe 36. Mm-hmm. I can live with that. As of yet, we still haven't determined who our mystery guest is. We're hoping something comes up on his DNA report. Somebody knows. Somebody always knows. Ah, great. Just here to lend you some local support. Just don't get in my way. Heard you were an asshole. Find out how and why this happened. And find out where they're taking the bodies. And I don't care how you do it. Find a way to get me his body. Mm-hmm. Yes, baby. Oh, babe, you make me laugh. I miss you so much. You got a bathroom? Yeah. It's right over there. Thanks. All right. I should probably go. Someone's in the store. Phew. Brian Barnes? Thanks for calling the Streamline Bus Station. Bus leaves at 11 :00. All right. Later! How can I help you? I need a locker, please. It's in the next room. Have a good day. Excuse me, sir. This is a fire lane. You can't park here. I'm sorry, Officer. I was just looking at some directions. Have a good day. Oh, shit. Morning, Sheriff. Well... afternoon at this point. Please don't get up. No need to bring anyone else in here. DEA, they wanted me to wait, but... Well, you see, this situation is a bit time-sensitive. So, what happened, Sheriff? Well, there's not much to say. We responded to a call. Couple of hunters saw something' out at, uh, Morris property. We checked it out. You know the rest. See, I don't, really. Let's just say you take me through it. All of it. Shit. OW! Oh. What's wrong, cupcake? What's wrong? Did you burn yourself? - Ah. - Mm. - Mm. - I'm fine. Look, it's not so bad. Not so bad. That's because it's not your hand. That's why it's not so bad. Not now, baby. Hey, baby. - Who's asking? - Not now. Hey. What I want... when I want... and absolutely where I want... ...is all you need to know. It's time to come to Daddy. That's right. Talk to me like that. You know what? I just want this right. Know what? I want you to start talking' to me like I like it, okay? No. I don't think so. Put it down. Put it down. Okay. Now nice and easy. Yeah, one more time. You're gonna give it to me just like I like it. Now you just do exactly what I say. Here we go. - What the fuck?! You just stay here. Hey! Hey, buddy! Hey, buddy? Hey! Hey, buddy, are you okay? Hey! He)!- Hey. Easy, man. Easy. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. - Back off. - Just lower the gun. Let's talk about this. Easy, easy, okay?! Just lower the gun, all right? Just, can we -- Can we talk about this? Where am I? - Huh? - Sorry? Who the fuck are you? Look, I-l fuckin' live here, man. Look, I'll drive you any place you want to go. Get back in the house. - No, I'll drive you! - Back in the house now! - All right, all right! - You hear me? Move! Just don't harm us, man. Shit! Let's go All right. Do as I say, and no one gets hurt. - Hey! - Okay. Okay. - Get down! - All right! - Listen, man. I-l can help you. - Shut up! Please don't do this. You don't have to do this. I need to think a second. I need to think. All right. I can't call the cops. Hey, look. We won't call the cops. I promise. Just...tell me what you need, man. - Okay. You got a garage? - Yeah. - You got rope? - Sure. - Get up. Get up. - Yeah. Okay. Listen to me! From now on, we all move as a unit, all right? You do what I say, and you'll be fine. - Move! Now. - Just don't hurt us. Just -- Okay. Here we are. Fuck. Fuck. I knew I shouldn't have came into work today. I promised your mother. I promised her. Now look what I let happen. I wouldn't let you work with me. So what do you do? Go join the fucking police force... under a different name. It's my fault. I... I should have kept you closer. I should have kept an eye on you. It's my fault. It's my fault. Tell me you have a name. We have someone who might be able to give us one. Let's go have a little chat with someone. I don't want him left alone. Someone stays with him day and night. And he stays above ground until the son of a bitch that did this no longer is. Ah. Please. Now I'm gonna show you what happens when you steal money from me. I didn't steal anything from you! I would never steal anything from you. Please! I need y'all to be quiet. You understand me? Fuck. Today of all clays. I could be playing' golf on the back nine. That's what you're thinking' about right now, is golf? But now I'm tied up in my own garage. This is good. Thank you. Thank you. You got any ideas? What are you up to? Black. I just got word from my contact at the hospital security. The good sheriff has checked himself out early. Copy that. Okay. You are not gonna believe this. The good old sheriff discharged himself against doctor's orders. Mm. Damn right it was against doctor's orders. Now, why would a man, a drugged-up man, get out of his hospital bed and walk around with his ear blown off? I have no idea. Because he's running from something or to somewhere. Here. The only vehicle in that time frame that has matching tire tracks. Just find out where he's going. Stay on the sheriff. And be careful. I'm pretty sure he's a complete piece of shit hiding behind a badge. Copy that. Get me a clear view of that license plate. Ahh. Oh. Baby, I missed you. Ahh. Hey, Mike. I was looking for you at the hospital. Yeah, well, I saw myself out. That's no place for me to get better, is it? I hear you. We've got a bit of a problem down here, though. Seems somehow we misplaced Sammy's body. What the hell are you talkin' about? How the hell do you misplace a body? No clue. You're serious? Well, what -- what about the ballistics? We never got a chance to even process him. Now, Mike, that's just terrible. Any idea where the body went now? Fuck if anyone knows. It's gone poof. Vanished. No shit. Mike, I'm gonna have to call you back. I'll get -- I'll get right back to you. Son of a bitch. Break in my house? Hi, Sheriff. We need to talk. Sit down! You nervous, Sheriff? You look nervous. Yeah, well, it's been a long day. You know, I heard about that. But I got a problem I think you can help me with. Okay. What's that? Now, you know me. You know who I am. Everybody knows who you are. Someone stole a lot of money from me. That I can live with. But where you can help me is to figure out who killed my men. First of all, I'm gonna tell you -- When we got there, they were already dead... except for the one... who shot me in the goddamn ear. You're alive, aren't you? Uh-huh. Look, I just don't know. I just don't know how I can help you, Mateo. One of them was my son. I'm real sorry to hear that. But like I said, when I got there, they were already dead. My son was with you. I'm sorry. I... Sam was a good deputy. L-I didn't know. About that guy that shot you... Look, he shot both of us. He shot Sammy, and -- and I tried to help him, and he shot me! Look, we thought they were dead. Tell me about him. I saw his face for 30 seconds. And then he shot me. I wish there was more, but I never saw this guy before in my life. I swear to God. I have no idea who these people are. Maybe you can help me find him. Unless you were planning on going somewhere. I don't know what I can do. The DEA has taken over. Come on. You're local police. Work with them. I'll really make it worth your while. Well, uh... that sounds just fine, Mr. Perez. This guy stole $3 million from me. Now you help me find him... and I'll give you a hefty finder's fee. And then you can just go on your merry way. Now that sounds like a good deal. You gonna keep pointing that gun at me, partner? Okay. You know me. So you know what happens if you don't. That's a hell of a good deal. Vmanos. It's gonna be a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Perez. Ahh. Damn. Phew. Something's wrong. I don't know, but... he's hiding something. He might be playing us. You know what? Keep somebody on him. Let's find out where it takes us. You really plan on letting him keep the money? That's loco! Hell, no. Come on. Cole. I'm at the sheriff's house, and I got a license plate for you. Can you run a history? Sure. What are the numbers? Foxtrot, Golf, Seven, Nine, Six, One, Hotel. Okay. Give it a second. Huh. People... this case just got a lot more interesting. Mateo Daniel Perez was spotted at the house of our friendly neighborhood sheriff. Now, what's a drug lord like Mateo doing hanging out with the sheriff? And to top it all off... I just found out that our little dead deputy is the son of the most successful drug lord ever. Now, people... we've had a guy on the inside of Perez's gang, but there's been no connection with the sheriff until now. What is going on? People, I need some answers. I need you to get your asses out there, or some heads will roll. All right. Look. Let's -- Let's try and stand up back to back, okay? Hell, no. You're gonna get us killed Just do what I tell you to do! When I go, "One, two, three," back to back, we're gonna stand up, and we're get the hell out of here. Hell, no! Just do it, okay? One, two, three. Ow. Stop it! Look, just... God damn it. Shut up. - Stand up! - Ow! No! Stand up with me. Stand -- Damn it. Will you stop?! - You are such an idiot. - Shit. You're callin' me an idiot? When you're dumb as dirt? Are you kiddin' me? You just shut up. You shut up! Look. Do you want him to come in here and kill us? We stay here, we wait it out. And we don't piss him off! Nice work, fish. We have a job for you when you get out. What the hell happened to you? You haven't checked in. What's going on? Aah! - Hey! - What? - What are you doin'? - Shh! What do you mean, "shh"? What? I need to go to the bathroom. Shut up! Shut up. Where's your manners, boy? You don't talk to a woman like that. The suspect used Highway 5 driving into this area. So we're concentrating our efforts here. We have roadblocks on every highway, and we're conducting house-to-house searches. Yeah, but how do we know he didn't ditch his vehicle? Or maybe took off on foot? Since we yet haven't located the van, we're still assuming he's in the possession of it. Do we have an I.D. on the suspect? Yes. We've extracted an image from a street cam. Waiting for blood DNA analysis. Haven't yet identified the suspects. Please remember, people, this is the suspect in the murder of a law-enforcement officer. I expect you all to be on your top game for this one. Any questions? Let's go catch this guy before he kills anyone else. Hurry up. What the hell are you doing here, Brian?! Brian? How do you know my name? ls this a joke? You're supposed to get me out. Get me out of this thing. I waited four hours for you, and nothin'. No phone call -- nothin'. And now you show up here, and you do this shit? What the hell are you thinking'?! And where's Bob? I have no idea what you're talkin' about, lady. I've never seen you before in my goddamn life. Are you joking? What the hell happened? Back the fuck up. You understand me? Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay- Look at me, Brian. You know me. I'm Christine. I know something fucked up happened. But I can help you. Just put the gun down. Just put the gun down, God damn it! Now tell me what happened. Hmm? Don't touch me. Just tell me what happened, honey. I was shot. Hit in the head. I don't know. It's all just a blur. Well, what do you remember? Nothin'. You understand? I don't remember a goddamn thing. It's alI just kind of faces and noise and shit. I'm sure it's just temporary. No! It's not temporary. I'm in trouble here. Anything can get fixed. You'll be fine. Everything will be fine. I shot a cop. I killed him. I know I shot other people, too. I just -- I just can't remember! I can't remember a fucking thing! Now, why would you go shooting' a cop? What was I supposed to do? Let him take me in? We'lI just have to figure it out... one thing at a time. But first... we got to take care of Howard. You said I was supposed to take you away from all this, right? - That's right. - Okay. Well, that explains the money and what I was doin' there. Money? What money? I didn't tell you about it? How much money are we talkin' about? I don't know. - Couple million. Maybe more. You really are my hero. Yeah. My hero. Stand up. Turn around. What are you doin', Brian? I am gonna take care of you. Shit. So, the mess was man-made. What did you do with it? What do you mean, what'd I do with it? I threw it in the trash. The bathroom looked like someone exploded all up -- I get the picture. Yeah. You got cameras in the bathrooms? Now, sir... you know that is so illegal. Show me where you threw the trash. I'm gonna need to see footage from that camera. This guy dangerous or something'? Or something. The footage from the security cam... let's see it. Why don't you tell me who this guy is first? Huh? Do you know a good parasitologist? A what? 'Cause if you don't put that camera down and erase that video, I'm gonna shove it so far up your ass that you'll taste it... and realize why the company's called Apple. To-fucking-day. With the security cam would be just lovely. All right. Thank you for your cooperation. Howdy, Sheriff. Jesse! Yes, Sheriff? What the hell happened in here? Oh. Those agents came by. Said they needed some things. Now, who authorized that? I did, silly. They had all them badges and paperwork and, well, you know. Son of a bitch. Have a good day, Sheriff. Mike. Sheriff. Thanks for meeting' me. Always. Sheriff, you look like shit! Sally, this is a good day to mind your own damn business. I heard about what happened to that kid. Sorry about your partner. Thank you, Sally. Thank you very much. Listen to me, Mike. The DEA, they shut me out. I got zero access. Now, I want to find the son of a bitch who killed Sam and shot me before they do. Now, they shut you out for a reason. Now, I wasn't here... and you didn't hear nothin' from me, okay? Now, I could lose my job just talkin' to you right now. - Go on, Deputy. - Well, they brought in some forensics hot shot from the city. Now you're suspect. Oh, you think I'm a suspect? They shot my goddamn ear off. - I'm disabled. - I know it. I could take my goddamn pension and walk away. But I want to find the son of a bitch who killed Sam. Figure that. I know. We all know. But There's just something that don't add up about that crime scene. You want to know what don't add up? They lost the body. How the hell they want to tie me to Sam's death without a body? - Tell me that. - Well, they lost the body, but not before some brown nosing' intern pulled the slug from the kid before he was missing'. Ballistics had a match... for your gun. I'm being set up, Deputy, and you know it. I do, but...rules are rules. I'm sorry, Sheriff. I got to take you in. Now, these things kind of sort themselves out, so you got to trust me here. Now, Mike... you know that's not gonna happen. I'd be dead before breakfast. I don't think the DEA's gonna go that far. You know who Sam's old man is? Mateo Perez. The Mateo Perez? Jesus. What'd you get yourself into? Now, he paid me a private visit. He wants me to find the guy and hand him over. Well, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna find this son of a bitch and hand him over. Well, what if you don't? You and I have seen enough dead bodies of people who have tangled with him to know that you don't tangle with Mateo Perez. Now, you know goddamn well I didn't kill Sam. I just need a little time to get out from underneath this. All right. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna forget the DEA. What the hell they doin', coming' in here and telling' us our business anyway. Right? You go take care of that business. I was never here, and neither were you. Thanks, Mike. You turn yourself in once you get this all squared away, right? I sure will. But I still need that favor. Just ask. I want to know where the DEA is concentrating' their investigation. Give me something...anything. They shut me out, and time is running out. I'll see what I can come up with. I owe you. Hell you do. So, do your dirty Leave your coat on, babe Bring it down to your knees So, girl, you're dirty And you're gonna know it Have you begging now, please don't leave You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine! So, do your dirty Leave your coat on, babe Bring it down to your knees So, girl, you're dirty And you're gonna know it Have you begging now, please don't leave TO life. Ahh. I told you I didn't want to be disturbed. Where is he? Okay. Just a little bit -- a little bit more. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Oh! Fuck. Fuck. Goddamn, I got to be more careful with these. We could leave and take the money and just disappear. No. We talked about that. Your husband will come after you. There are ways around that. We could just kill him. No. We ain't doin' that now. All right, well, just vanish and disappear into the sunset like we planned. I mean, after that, I couldn't imagine being without you. Let's just go. What the fuck is that? - Shit! - God damn it! Shit. The phone's dead. No calls out until the security company calls and clears it. They'll send a car if no one answers. We got to go now. You understand? Come on. - Help! - No. Leave him! Help. There's a fire in here! Help! Help! Come into my fuckin' house! Fuck you, man! Aah! My fuckin' nose. What are you doin'? Give -- Give me the gun, Chris. Back off. Wha-- What? Okay. Back the hell up. I will shoot you. Really? Plans change. Sex was good and all, but you're a little boring. Plus, that's a lot of money. Give me the keys -- now! What are you doin'? How long you been fuckin' him? Huh? You pathetic bitch. I fuckin' hate you. You know what? You're gonna end up right back in that trailer-trash park that I found you in. I will shoot you. It was all about the money, huh, Chris? It's always about the money, honey. Now get me the fucking money! Ohhh. Oh. Oh, baby. You know, maybe we should just get married. That way I can get you your green card. Things work out, maybe I'll even get you a boob job. Aw, shit. Yeah, Mike? Now, you didn't get this from me. May be some-thin'. May be nothin'. Got a call about a house alarm in Madison. Guy who owns the house is Mateo Perez's lawyer. Was gonna do a drive-by, but I figured... you might want to take a look instead. Like I said, may be nothin'. Great. Thanks, Mike. Just don't get yourself killed. Right. I swear to God. I swear to God. I won't stop looking'. Not until I find the fuckin' both of you. What are you fuckin' doin'?! You don't know him like I do. He's a monster. Fuckin' damned rapist. He raped me -- again and again. Do you know how that feels?! You promised to help me get out of here. You give me that money right now! Drop your fuckin' guns. Get over there with your boyfriend! Drop the fuckin' gun! Put it down, motherfucker! Shit. Did you miss me? I'm sure glad to see you. You seriously fucked up my day, son. You took my money, and you left me with Mateo Perez. You dumb shit. We could have been partners on this. Goddamn! I didn't think I'd see you again. Well, next time you better kill me all the way. Well, next time, I'll remember that. Don't strain yourself. I could give two shits about the trouble you got yourself into. - Or why you killed the kid! - Kid? All I care about is the goddamn money! Now where the fuck is it?! - It's right here. - You think I'm stupid? That don't look like $3 million, asshole! Now where's the rest?! I might have put that money somewhere safe. Now, where exactly did you put it?! Well, see, that's the problem. With all this head-trauma shit, I can't remember. I'm not gonna ask you again. Now I'm gonna count to 5, and then I'm gonna paint the floor with this little girl's brains if you don't tell me where the goddamn money is! Please, Brian. Please tell us where you put the money! Five... four... Go ahead and shoot her. - ...three... - I can't remember. There were three, four, five bags of money in the back of that van, and I only see one! Tell me where that fuckin' money is, or I'll blow your goddamn balls off, and you can have this bitch. Sheriff... you might want to look outside. Nobody touches the sheriff! He's mine! Fuck! Why can't I catch a goddamn break? Shit. Christine, come here. Get down, get down. And don't move. You understand me? Stay down! Okay, asshole. Last chance. Where's the goddamn money? I'll blow your fuckin' balls off! Then we'll see what you do with that little girlfriend of yours. All the money in the world, and you can't get laid. Like father, like son. Para mijo, cabrn. Come in. - Long night? - Whew. Pulled all the footage from the surrounding traffic cams. Take a look at photo number two. Hmm. Thank you, Davis. Yes, ma'am. I think we found our guy. Several traffic cams show a van blowing through red lights. It's now in the parking garage at The Streamline Bus Station. I ran the plates, and the van belongs to Perez. Rooker... I need you to bring him in alive. Give me the keys -- now! Brian. We need to talk. How do you know my name? What do you mean? Can I have another, please? I won't be any trouble. Okay, tough guy. Your funeral. Yeah. We're here now with Agent lmani Cole from the Drug Enforcement Administration with more information regarding the victims of... - Hey. Do me a favor, bud. - Hmm? - Turn that up. - Earlier this morning, one of the most successful drug lords in history, Mateo Danny Perez, was killed in a DEA sting. Unfortunately we lost several great agents. We're asking the public -- if you have any knowledge of the whereabouts of Agent Brian Michaelson to contact us. Thank you very much, Agent lmani Cole. Earlier, we spoke with Michaelson's family as they made a request for more information. Agent Michaelson's wife had this to say. We just want Brian home -- with his family. I love you. She's really gonna miss you. I love you, too. I love you, too. Promise me this is gonna be the last one. One more, and you'll hang it up. I promise. One last final mission. Then I'm on a desk till retirement, okay? Okay Okay. She's really gonna miss you. I love you. Daddy! Come here, honey. Oh, my baby girl. Daddy, please don't leave. I'll be back, okay? I promise. I'm really gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too. I'm really gonna miss you. Promise me this is gonna be the last one. What's this? Transfer request. I miss my wife and daughter. My wife needs to know I'm coming home at night. I'll do this one last one in the field, but... I'm gonna need a desk after that. You and Bob have been partners for a long time. Yesterday Agent Michaelson's partner, Robert Rooker, was identified as one of the victims. Christine having second thoughts? No, she'll be fine. You about ready? As I'll ever be. Meet your alias... ...Brian Barnes. We flooded the Web with this information. Just memorize it and burn what you don't need. Now, remember... we're in this together. Whatever happens, I got your back. You always do. I'm just scared. We can and will protect you. If I do this... if I help you... I need to disappear... 'cause Howard would kill me. I promise. We'll take you away from all this, okay? Get you into Witness Protection. But we can only push the paperwork through if you help us nail your husband's boss. It's not enough to take down the lawyer. We need someone on the inside. If they figure out you're a cop, they won't just kill you. They'll torture you to find out how much you know first. And if that leads back to me, they'll -- Hey. hey. Let's not let that happen. Where we take you, Howard will never be able to find you. Look at me. You can start a new life. Okay. What do you need me to do? That's the number to this burner phone. Completely untraceable. Text your address to that number tomorrow, and I'll come get you. What about Howard? Two drops of this in his food or drink, and he'll be out for 24 hours. By then, I'll have the cash. And we'll be halfway to Mexico... to start our retirement. Product's good. $2 million in cash just like we talked about. Do we have a deal? Yeah, we got a deal. Brian, your cover is blown. Your cover is blown. Do you hear me? Your cover is blown. What the fuck you think you're doin'? Sorry, Brian. It's a lot of money. Brian. We need to talk.
