Last one in takes their top off. Don't you dare! - Will you get me a beer? - I'd love to. You're so... Hey, Dawn, got something for you. Listen, Wyatt, I already told you. I am not interested in your something. - What is this? - Light it. So cool. Sadie, look at this. Sadie? Sadie? Sadie? Where did she go? Sadie? Wyatt? ( shouting ) Wyatt! Whoa! Whoa! Get out of the water! Faster! Hurry! Okay, um... We leave in five minutes. Okay. We've got a really long drive ahead of us, and I would like to be there in time for lunch. This should be the last of it. Dad: Good. Not sure how much more we can fit. We can strap Harrison to the roof. Yeah, or Molly could just stay back and water the plants. Can I? Dad: No. You're coming. Is there a body in here? Mom: Not yet. You got any threes? Go fish. Come on! Do you have any, uh... ...fours? Are you kidding me? You're killing me. This is ridiculous. Okay, Grandma, new plan. Let's ditch these losers. Forget camping. You and I, we're going to Vegas. Let's make some money. Let's have some real fun. How about that? - Got it. - Cool. Harrison: What? Oh, come on! Are you-- Cheaters never prosper, Molly. Tell that to Grandma. Time to go. Who's ready for Lake Drover? Yay! Woo! Yay. That's the spirit! Let's roll! Go. ( music playing ) Oh, sunshine You light up my day And I need to know, I need to know Before this all fades away Oh, because I'm feeling bored, I'm feeling gold So, darling, what's your name? ( chattering ) Did you see what Becky was wearing the other day? It was an assault to the eyes. It's like she has zero consideration for those of us that have to look at her all day. Some people are so oblivious to the feelings of others. God, I know. Uh... Say cheese. Cheese, bitch. Oh, and don't post that anywhere. My boss thinks I'm home with the bird flu. Oh, my God. Amanda, I look hideous. How could you not warn me about all these flyaways? This water is ruining my composition. - ( Amanda gasps ) - ( splash ) Amanda? Amanda? Amanda? Oh! Let's stretch our legs, everyone. You having fun yet? Yeah, sure. This spot is very special to your Grandma. She used to come here every summer as a little girl. Did you know that? No. But I'm beginning to see the appeal. Pull it together, son. Let's go get the cabin keys. What kind of trouble are you two getting into? Hey, Molls, you know, you can at least pretend like you're having a good time. I could, but who would I be fooling, really? Oh, come on. It's not all that bad. We got good weather. We got free food. Mom's doing my laundry. It's great. Wow, you're such a good son. Thanks for noticing, Molls. Hey, beautiful. How you doing? You feel okay from the trip? Being here brings back a lot of nice memories. Yeah? Well, I'm happy to share it with you. You want to go talk to those pretty girls, don't you? Yes, more than anything. Do you mind? - Go ahead. - Thank you. Oh, Harrison? What? Hair? There you go. Paddles for the canoe are under the bunk bed. We've had trouble with the pipes, so if you have problems, give me a holler. Thank you, mister... - Jones. - Mr. Jones. Just Jones. What's the best number to reach you? Don't have one. Well, how do we holler? Hey, Jones! I need some tidbits. You got any five eyes? Sure do, tiger. Got it. Back here somewhere. Expecting a call? No. It's a weekend, Molly. A long weekend. You can live three days without him. Everyone set? ( chattering ) - Let's go, Harrison! - Okay. ( chattering ) - Cool. - Let's go, Harrison! Okay! All right, I'll see you later. Bye. What? Let's go! - I'm working here. - I see that. You got it? Mom: Harrison, will you come grab some bags? Harrison: Yep. Yeah, hand me the heavy ones. Last stop, princess. I thought we were only here for a few days. Looks like we're moving in. Mom: Your dad might have brought the whole sporting goods store along for the trip. I'll be back to help you out, hon. Mom: Okay. Sounds good. Come here. Now that is a view. Molly: It's a lake. It's a beautiful lake. Check it out. Check it out? Yeah, take it in. Enjoy nature's splendor. Harrison! Don't be a lagger! Harrison: Coming! Hey. Hello! You going to help us? Can't. Why? I'm enjoying nature's splendor. Okay. You know she dies in the end? What are you doing here? I took a bus. I wanted to surprise you. I can't believe you're here. I know, right? Mom: Ahem. Oh, hey, Mrs. K. Hello, Curtis. He followed me home. Can I keep him? I suppose. Don't worry. We'll keep it totally PG. We have a house guest. And I thought we could head out in the canoe, just the two of us, like we used to when you were a little girl. Why don't we go out just the two of us, Rick? You know, we can let the kids go do their own thing. You know, it might be nice to have a little time alone. Come here. - Dude. - Hey! What are you doing here, man? - Harrison! - What's up, man? What a good surprise. It's going to be such a good weekend now. What are you doing here? Seems like he couldn't stay away from your sister. That's awesome. Cool. Great. All right, Grandma, It's going to be me and you this weekend. Ready to party? Mom, why don't you take the kids into town and show them the sights? Or find some great spot on the water? I know just the place. I'll go change. Hey, beautiful. You're looking good. You ready to have fun? All right, so who's hungry? All right, it's unanimous. So we're definitely going to go sneak off and make out, right? - Absolutely. - Sweet. Grandma, you need any help carrying anything? No, no. I got it. All right. You guys grab food. We'll go stake out a spot on the water. Okay. Hey, did you want anything special? A popsicle. Cherry. Oh, living dangerous. Like it! Howdy. What was that? I'm being friendly with the local people. It's the Ozarks. It's not the wild west. People in the Ozarks know what howdy means. Dude! Ozarks. What can I get you fine young gentlemen today? Um, let's do-- let's do four hotdogs. Coming right up. So how you been, dude? What you been up to, man? We got to hang out more often, man. I know. I've been busy. What's there to do around here? What's the plan? What's up? Talk to me. Hiking, fishing, more hiking-- outdoorsy stuff. Right, so that's a list of really boring activities. Don't want to do that. Oh, you know what? I did meet some beautiful girls earlier in bikinis, and they invited us to a fireworks festival. Okay. All right. I'll ask Molly-- your sister, my girlfriend. I don't know if you remember. I'll see if she's cool with that. That still just sounds really weird to me. I don't like that. Heart wants what the heart wants. She's cute. You boys just passing through? Vacation actually. We're staying in a cabin on the lake. Hey, do you have, like, mosquito stuff? Right. West Nile, dude. No joke. Um... 'kay. I was thinking of spray. These woods ain't nothing to mess with, boy. Full of wild animals. Dangerous animals. You wouldn't be the first person to go missing around here. Ain't no reasoning with a wild animal. They're acting on pure instinct. Slice you head to toe before you can blink. These woods ain't safe, and this here is the great equalizer. - Yeah. - Cool. Thank you for that not at all terrifying advice. We'll take that to heart, but I think we're good with the hotdogs and the chips, so... - Nothing else? - Oh, yeah, um... ...let me get a popsicle. Cherry or grape? Cherry. I wish you would have brought a suit. The water's real nice. The water's real nice. I'm good. Are you just planning on reading that book all day? That's new. Adults don't usually play the reading is bad for you card. I like a good book, Molly, but stick your nose in one for too long, and you might miss out on something big. I'll risk it. Suit yourself. Oh! This part is very deep. Wasn't expecting that. Oh, drat. Grandma! Grandma! Whoa. - Wow. - Yeah. You like my wheels? Yeah, that's awesome. Six cylinder, five-inch alter lift, 15 bolt FF rear, and a genuine harpoon cannon. Mounted it myself. Why do you need a harpoon cannon? To shoot my harpoon with. Huh. Is your pal slow? Yes, but I think what he meant was why would you need a harpoon cannon? This ain't the city, boy. I like to be prepared. Okay. Just seems a little extreme. Curtis! Curtis! - Moll? - What's wrong? What is it? What is it? Oh, hey! Are you okay? Are you hurt? No, no, no, no! Grandma, Grandma! - What? Where is Grandma? - It pulled her in! She was standing there one second and-- Slow down! What are you talking about? - It grabbed her! - What grabbed her? It was-- it was a shark. Okay. No, Harrison. I think she's dead! Show me where you were. Come on! Harrison: Careful, Molls. Grandma! Grandma! Is this spot? Yes. Yeah, see? My blanket's still here. - Okay. - What's that? - What? - Right there. I don't know. I can't really tell. What are you doing? Are you, like, going out there? No! Harrison, you can't go out there! Relax. I'll be fine. I'm just going for a swim. - It's not safe! - It's fine, Molly. Calm down! Come on. It's fine. Just let him go. Let him go. - Curtis, take my phone. - Don't-- If you see a shark, just yell. No. What is it? It's her hat! Arm! Arm! Arm! Arm! Oh, gross, it touched me! Oh, I love that beanie. Harrison! - Cutis: Swim! - Molly: Swim! Curtis: Swim! Swim faster! Molly: Come on! Hurry, Harrison! Swim! ( gunshot ) That there? Yes. One of those dangerous creatures I was telling you about. ( ringing ) Sheriff's office. What's your emergency? Curtis: There's a shark in the lake. Can you repeat that? There's a shark in the lake, or in the river, or just-- it's in the water here. You been drinking, son? What? No! I mean, no, not today, I haven't. Look, it ate my girlfriend's Grandma! I know you're trying to be funny, but I suggest that you find a better use of your time. Prank call. Damn kids. Well, you know how they get when the festival rolls around. All that teenage mischief. Come on, you remember what it's like to be young and impulsive. Hmm. Or not. He hung up on me because he doesn't believe me that there's a shark in the river. Well, of course not. Whose ever heard of a shark in a river before? This has happened a couple times before. Most sharks can survive in fresh water. But why would they come here? They swim up from the ocean. Sometimes they like to give birth to their young in the warm water. Ozark shark. Curtis... Never mind. When they come to birth their young, are they always this aggressive? No! Sharks don't usually attack people, not even the ones that have swam up here before. We've never had a reported shark attack. What are you saying? I'm saying that something riled this one up. The problem is that sometimes sharks develop a taste for human blood. Not a good day to go skinny dipping. Mom and Dad, they're taking the canoe out. You don't want the back seat? You're the one steering this ship, captain. I'm just along for the ride. All right. Plus, I have a way better view from the bow for when I need to give you directions. That's my lady. Well, I'm going to do my best, but I know I was not your first choice for canoe buddy. You'll do. There's no guarantee that they left yet. They might be okay. All right. I'm coming with you. - No. - No, but-- You've been through a lot, okay? Well, so have you! Yeah, but I don't know what I'm going to find. Just stay with Curtis and Jones, please? Make sure she doesn't go near the water, all right? Yeah, sure. I'll call you. I'll let you know what I find out. It's okay. It's fine. The cabin's really close. I'm sure he'll get to them in time. Wait! What are we supposed to do? Try animal control. I'll call animal control. Mom! Dad! ( line ringing ) ( phone ringing ) Hey, the canoe's gone. I don't know. They left already. I'm going to drive around the lake and look for them. Okay, well if you find them, call me. Okay. Will do. We're too late. They're already out on the water. Well, you know, we can't just sit around here. We got to do something. Do you have a boat? We're not going out on the water. - You saw what happened.  - He's got a gun. Yeah, well, that bullet did nothing to that shark! Baby, my parents are out there! We have to find them and tell them to get off of the water. No, the boy's right. We go out there, we going to need a lot more firepower. What kind of firepower? Let me show you something. What is this place? My workshop. Holy shop. What is all this stuff? Jones: I told you. I like to be prepared. For what? The zombie apocalypse? Among other things. All right, this would work, but I'd have to tweak it first. It'd take too long. Grab that. Totally. I get to use this? No. You get to hold it until I use it. Okay. I'm fine with that. All right, guys, we really have to get going. Let's find that shark before it finds lunch. - Babe. - Yeah, I'm coming. ( man screams ) Whoa. Oh, you missed. - Now, boy! - What? - Now! - Oh. Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Watch out! Dude, you just stabbed a shark with a trident. Oh, there's two of them. Six? Damn. We're going to need a bigger everything. Mom! Dad! Woman: Help! Hello? Help me! Where are you? Over here! Hang on! I'm coming! Hello? Help me! Help me! Where are you? Keep yelling so I can find you! Help me! Help! Over here! Hello? Where are you? - Hello? - Help me! You all right? Not really. I'm stuck. It's all right. I'm coming to get you. Wait. You can't cross-- It's fine. I know about the sharks. It's okay. No, but you can just-- It's fine. It's not that far. I'm going to come, all right? I know. Just wait. I'm coming. - You okay? - Yeah. All right. Here I come. Aah! Smooth. That was the practice run. I'm coming back out for you. You might want to actually use the canoe. - Oh. - Yeah. Right. Okay. - Whoa. - Jones: Ozark code. That which nature does not provide, you devise. - Yes. - Manners, boy. I like to call this my paddle prod. 2,500 volts of pure punishment guaranteed to make your target reconsider. How does it work? Little switch on the side. ( electricity crackles ) Guaranteed to light up any room. Should we be using that near water? Aim high. Whoa! When would you ever even need this? You need it now. Yeah, okay. I guess. There you go. Now put it down. This one is particularly delicious. Nasty piece of business, but I think we can get it to work on sharks. I don't know. It says bear on it. I don't think so. Ah. Happy? You know, no. I'm not very happy. - Whoa. - Eh? What's under that tarp? Boy, you better pray you never need to find out. Now, for our main attraction. ( powering up ) - Big Betty. - Whoa! Giant air cannon constructed of piping and canisters. Curtis: That's awesome. What does it shoot? The question is what doesn't it shoot? Doesn't really answer my question. Just about anything you can put in it. - Awesome. I call that. - No. - Come on. Please? - No. You need to learn to share. I want something. Pick me out something. Here you go, son. Now, when that shark swallows you, just pull that little pin. Dude, do not throw a grenade, man! You're insane. I'm not going to get swallowed by a shark. This one's for you. Watch the recoil on that. I don't shoot guns. Time you learned, precious. Bullets will barely even hurt those things. A whole bunch of them might. Dude! You gave her a gun? I want a gun. Give me a gun. Look at all those guns on the wall. Give me-- give me something. Will you please just give me something that I don't have to be swallowed to use? No. No way. We're taking the harpoon cannon truck? - Yes. - Yes! - Can I drive? - No. I gotcha. There's barely enough room for us with all these weapons. In the grand scheme of things, they take priority. - Let's go find your parents. - Let's do it. Aw! - Get in! - Can I ride in the back? - Yes. - Yes! Mom: You saw them? - Yeah, I mean-- - Were you spying? No, I wasn't spying, but it's kind of weird seeing-- Spy Dad. I don't remember packing this. You didn't. Harrison did. Did you leave him any? No, I did not. Oh, our son has questionable taste. - So does our daughter. - Curtis is harmless. All I'm saying, is I preferred him as Harrison's unemployed, irresponsible friend, as opposed to my unemployed, irresponsible, future son-in-law. It's her first real relationship. Yeah, I mean, they're young. She'll outgrow him-- I hope. Don't worry. You're going to have plenty of new boyfriends to irrationally hate. - We should probably go back. - Just a little bit longer. Maybe me and you could rock the boat a little. ( thud ) - What was that? - I don't know what that was. - ( thud ) - Oh! Honey? It can't be. Row! Diane! Row! To the shore! No! No, no! Rick, don't! I got it. I can almost-- - Don't! - I got it! This isn't the way to the cabin. I think I know my way around these woods better than you do, missy. I'm going the back way around the lake. It's quicker. Hey, what's up, guys? Get in the back, son! Mom: Your shirt. Tight! Make it tight and elevate. - It got my ring!  - Okay, hold on! Hold on. Um... Pull it back. You got it! Nice shot! Okay. Hey, you ever shoot the harpoon cannon while you're driving? I'm about to shoot you while driving. - No, you're not. - A flare. Flare. Right there. Over there. All right. All right. I got it. I'm on it. What's your name? Dawn. I'm Harrison. How did you get stuck out there? I was out on the water with some friends, and this shark showed up. And they just left you out there? No. - Oh. - Yeah. It got my Grandma, too. Sorry. Oh! Oh, no! Where is this going? I don't know. Let's just go! No, I mean, where does this lead? To the lake. Oh, my God. There's, like, this huge firework celebration tonight. Half the town's going to be on the water. We have-- we have to warn them. My phone's at the bottom of the river. Do you have-- No, I left it in my friend's truck. There's never any service out there. Damn. All right. Hop in. - Are you crazy, dude? - My parents are in the water. I'm not going to let this thing get the drop on them. We got to go. We'll stay close to the shore, and we'll keep it in our sights. I don't think you understand. There are sharks, plural! Wait, are you sure? Yeah, I've been watching them swim in and out all day. How many? I don't know. Five or six. What does it matter? Okay, we'll just stay close, and if we have to bail, we have to bail. We'll keep it in our sights. This is a horrible idea. Yeah. The worst. Are you coming? No. No! Suit yourself. Wait, you can't just leave me here. I'm going this way. If you want to come, you come. If you want to stay, that's your choice. All right, all right. I'm coming. Welcome aboard. This is crazy. Oh, God. Take this. Do you know what you're doing? I've done it. Come on, now. You can do it. You're doing great. We're almost there! Keep rowing. You're doing good. Come on, Diane! Rick! Focus on the shore. You're doing great! Focus! Focus! Keep going! You're doing great! We're almost there. Focus on the shore! Row, baby! Come on, row! You got it! You got it! You got it! You got the shark! Mom, are you okay? I'm fine. Your father-- Curtis: That's a lot of blood. Dad, what happened? I'm okay. It looks worse than it is. Really? Because it looks really bad. Sorry. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Thanks. What is going on? Sharks, ma'am. Where's your brother? Molly! He went looking for you. Harrison: Hey, you doing okay? Peachy. I'm sorry about your friends. Thanks. I'm sorry about your Grandma. Yeah. Dawn: I did this. My friends were throwing fireworks in the water. They woke it up, pissed it off. No, you know, that thing's a wild animal. It runs on instinct. It's a force of nature. It's primal. You can't-- you can't blame yourself for it. That's what a crazy old guy with a gun told me earlier today, anyway. Yeah, maybe not, but four people are dead because of me. And now how many more are going to die? We're not going to let them, all right? I promise. Here. Thanks. Thanks, babe. Some vacation, huh? Curtis: Anything, Molls? He's not answering. I'm sure he's fine, though. Harrison's a smart guy. Are we talking about that lanky fellow from earlier with the cherry popsicle? I respectfully disagree. We'll find him. Molly, where's your grandma? She, uh-- she's gone, Mom. The shark-- I was too late. Yeah, real sad stuff. Gone too soon. May she rest in peace. Enough said. We are burning daylight here. I'm sorry. Who are you? This is Jones. The bait shop attendant? Don't worry. I know these woods better than anybody. We'll circle back around with Big Betty, get the drop on those sharks, and find your boy. Look, I do not think that we should be following some bait shop attendant. He already killed two sharks, and in, like, really, really cool ways. Ma'am, with all due respect, you do not want anyone else leading you out here today. No shark is going to tango with my girl. - I think we should follow him. - Yep, me, too. Let's do it. Now that that's settled... first we'll move north. Aah! I'm coming, Jones! I'm coming! - Jones!  - Aah! - Jones! - Aah! ( blubbering ) Reach out! No! Jones! Jones! Jones! What do we do now? - Hey, easy. - I'm okay. Harrison's not here. Oh! Oh, Dad. Dad, I'm so sorry about Grandma. I... It's okay. It's okay, Molly. It's not your fault. We can't worry about that right now. Let's just focus on finding your brother. Harrison... Molly: He said he was going to drive around the lake to try to find you. Harrison wouldn't go out on the water, would he? I don't think so. - Oh, no. - Mom, what? What was that? We're out on the water. Mom! Mom, come on! We got to go! Mom! Mom! You got to come on! Yeah! Hit it harder! Hit it harder! Stab it-- stab it! Use both hands! - Use both hands! - Just stop helping! Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Rick! Come on. Yeah, there you go. - Watch out! - Watch out! What the hell is that? 2500 volts of punishment. Nice! How shocking. Ha ha ha ha! Curtis, stop making jokes! What? Sorry, it's just my best friend's missing. I just saw a guy get his arm bitten off. Sorry, I just make jokes to deal with it. Yeah, I'm sorry. Come on. Let's go find Harrison. ( muttering ) Wait, hold on. I don't see it anymore. Give it a minute. I'm not seeing anything. It's okay. We're almost to the river now. It's a straight shot from here. - You sure? - Yeah. I think it's coming back up. Wait. I think that's something else. Hold on. I'm going to get it. Oh... Mom! Dad! Maybe it's not theirs. No, I didn't get their fast enough! We don't know anything yet! They could still be alive. Look, hey, you're no good to them like this. Let's just keep moving, okay? Yeah, you're right. Come on, let's go. Thanks. He's not here. Harrison! Harrison! Right here. This way. Be careful, Moll. Diane: Harrison! Harrison! There was somebody down here! Do you think he crossed it? Maybe. Got to be a reason he didn't double back to the car. Curtis: Or he was never here. What? I'm sure he's fine, y'all. He's not even around here anyways. He's probably with the bikini babes over at the fireworks show while we're running around here like a bunch of idiots in the woods. Fireworks show? We saw it driving in. There will be a crowd there... people in the water. They'll be completely exposed. We have to warn them. ( music playing ) I got a metal heart Right deep inside of me Ooh, and I think you got the key, darling Yeah I got you in my mind And this is all the time Don't know if can let it go Is it even possible? Yeah ( chattering ) Sheriff's office. What's your emergency? Hey, yeah, there are a bunch of sharks in the water. - You again. - Yes, it is me again. Look, please, just don't hang up on me, okay? Listen, because you ignored me last time, two people have died, all right? Now, you need to get out here because there are sharks in the water eating people and you need to get them out. You got a real sick sense of humor, son. I'm not joking with you, okay? Look, my name is Curtis, and I'm going to be at the fireworks festival, all right? You come down here, you can arrest me yourself. That's a mighty tempting offer. So you're coming? I'm leaving right now. What did he say? I think I got through to him. Another prank call? - Hmm. - It's kind of weird. ( music playing ) Oh, sunshine You light up my day And I need to know, I need to know Before this all fades away Oh, because I'm feeling bored, I'm feeling gold So, darling, what's your name? Addy! Come. Let's get you set up, okay? ( ringing ) Sheriff's office. Hi, Susan. No. Tiger hasn't been by. He's off today. He's working the festival tonight. Well, you know him. He just probably snuck off down to the river. Been talking about buying those new flies for a day or so. I wouldn't worry about it. No problem. I will keep a look out. Susan can't get in touch with Tiger. Should I call him? Let the man fish in piece. You missed the turn! The festival's that way! We're making a quick stop first! - Wait, is it-- - Yep. Sweet! You guys are going to love this place. It's got, like, all these awesome weapons like a double-bladed katana, and, like-- They're going to see it, hon. Yeah, you're going to see it. It's like a playground for psycho killers, or, like, if you're trying to kill a bunch of sharks. Check it out, check it out, check it out! I know that man saved our lives, and I will be forever grateful, but there was something very wrong with him. Do we really need all of this? I mean, the police are on their way. Bullets won't be enough. We need more. Well, this is certainly more. - Oh, darling. - Yeah? I think I found something we can use. Yeah, that'll work. It's not safe in the water. Sorry. Just go find your mom. We need to warn these people now. Mommy! Mommy! They grabbed me! ( whispering ) Shark! ( muttering ) In the water! Come on, you got to get out! Get out! Did they say "shark"? Damn, I thought that was going to work. That usually works in movies. - They don't believe us. - Would you? - Probably not. - Yeah. We need to get these people out of here somehow. Yeah, but how? ( crowd shouting ) Come on, quick! Before it comes back! - Dawn: Go! - Oh, my God! Come on! Jump in the water! Come on, swim! - Swim! - Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Easy. Let's go! Dawn: Come on! You can do this! - Come on! - Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, come on, come on. Go! Woman: It's coming, Jennifer! It's coming! Harrison: Come on. - Come on! Come on! - I'm so scared! - Relax. I got you. - I'm so scared. I got you. I'm trying-- get your leg up. - Come on! - ( screaming ) - Help! - Come on! Come on! You're welcome! Come on. You okay? - Yeah. - Nicely done. I hold a grudge. I'll remember not to tick you off I know you've just, like, been through some stuff, but I was thinking we could, like-- movies or bowling? I don't know. What do you have around here to do? Oh, no. Molly? Mom! Dad! ( imitating Jones ) No, boy. - Harrison: Yo.  - Oh, dude! - You live! - Shark proof, baby. Me, too. Well, Molly helped. Yeah, she like shot it with this crazy thing. It's outfitted to shoot weaponized deer antlers or something. Where did you get that by the way? - Molly: Well--  - Dude, you missed all of it. Like, dude, Jones' workshop had amazing weapons. There was-- there's a double bladed samurai sword! His guns have guns. It was pretty awesome. Where's Jones? Mr. Jones? The guy who runs the bait shop? It's just Jones. Yeah, well, it was anyways. Hello. How are you? Bikini babe? Bikini babe? Yeah. This is Dawn. Dawn, this used to be my friend, Curtis. Curtis: Oops. Woman: Help! Help! Somebody help me! Please, somebody help me! Shoot, shoot, shoot! Help, please! Please, somebody! It's too fast. I can't get it from here. What if we lure it this way, and then she'll have enough time to get to the dock? Please, somebody help me! Rick: Can you lure him in? - Curtis: Yeah. - All right. Let's get as close as we can. Help!

( Molly sobbing ) - Molly. - No. Come on. - No! - Come on. Molly? Where are you going? You heard him. Someone should go talk to her. I'll go. II should do it. It should be me. I'll make sure she's okay. Do you want me to go with you? Thank you for keeping him safe. Yeah, thanks. Nice to meet you. I wish it was under better circumstances. We should call someone. I don't have a phone. Well, let's find someone who does. Come on! Come on, I'm right here! Come on! Come and get me! - Molly. - Come on! Hey. - Come on! - Easy. Harrison, he's getting away. Let it. We're safe now. There's just one left. Everybody's out of the water. I need to go after it. No, you don't. Curtis is dead. I know. Jones is dead. Grandma is dead. I need to end this. It's not our fight, Molly. Isn't it? Are we really going to do this? I learned from the best. All right, just watch where you point that thing. Okay, let's go. All right, there's only one shark left, right? Yeah, but it's the big one. What's the plan? Remember that other thing that Curtis mentioned? Yeah. Well, this is that other thing. How do you know that even works? Well, we'll find out. She's hungry? We'll give her something to chew on. So, we're going to throw garbage at it? What's the plan? Like, pollute the lake and wait for it to die of natural causes? What is this thing supposed to fire? Anything you can fit in it. They want a show, let's give them a show. - You got a cell? - Yeah, yeah. We got to call 911. Sheriff's office. Hold, please. Sheriff's office. Hold, please. Yes, ma'am, I understand. We are taking this very seriously. Wait, how many sharks? Hold, please. Sheriff's office. Yes, sir. We're on our way. Please hold. Sheriff's office. Please hold. Sheriff's office. Harrison. Boom. Come on, you stupid fish. He's not falling for it. You think you can hit him from here or what? No. Well, I guess that's it. I just need to get closer. Closer? There is no closer. This is as close as we get. That's it. Molly: There. Out there? Are you crazy? No, you can't go out on that float. - You'll be a sitting duck. - I don't care. Okay, then I'll go. No. No. This was my plan. Nobody else is dying for me today. Yeah, well, I'm not letting you die either. Please, Harrison, just... Okay, then we both go. No, I need you here in case something goes wrong. Really? You think you're going to convince me by reminding me that things could go wrong? Harrison. We both go. - Fine. Fine. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Wait. Grab the other box of mortars. You don't think we have enough? Just in case. Okay. Molly! - Just watch my back. - Come on! You're so stupid. You're so-- please be careful. - Sheriff's office. - There are shark attacks at the lake. You need to get down here now. Yes, sir. We're on our way. Hold please. How much longer until you're-- she hung up on me. I don't see him anywhere! Do you see him? Molly! Call them back! No, no! I lost the lighter! Molly, just forget it. You need to come back. Find me another! Molly, look out! Harrison, I need that lighter! Find me a lighter! We need to find a lighter. I have one! I have one! Molly! Heads up! Thanks, Dad. Molly, what are you waiting for? Do it! Should have stayed in the ocean, bitch. Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! ( siren ) - Way to go! - Thanks. Okay, sis! Ozark code-- that which nature does not provide, you devise. Nice shooting, sweetheart. Thanks, Dad. How long are you in town for? Well... Next year, we're going to go skiing.
