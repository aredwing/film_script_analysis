You're a man now Bury your first toy and the portrait of your mother THE MOLE The mole is an animal that digs tunnels underground ln search of the sun, it sometimes comes to the surface When it sees the sun, it is blinded Kill me! Kill me, please! Who was it? Kill me, for pity's sake! Who was it? Who? Who? - lt's the colonel - How many? Another five men Where? ln the Franciscan mission The colonel's not selfish. He uses women once and gives them away The colonel said he'd kill anyone who touches me And who told you to? Don't anticipate my wishes! Sorry! They have no souls, but sometimes they get bored and l throw them my leftovers Come on, dogs! Take your little piece! Stop, dogs! Kiss them on the mouth Keep going! Kiss the other too! Stop, dogs! Be good These dogs like to watch They want to see your breasts Eat, dogs! Who are you to hand out justice? l'm God No...this no! Don't do this to me! No! Destroy me. Never depend on anyone Cry little boy! Cry and then he'll pity you lt's bitter Moses found water in the desert The people couldn't drink it because it was bitter The water was named Marah lt's turned sweet! l'll call you Marah because you're like bitter water How will we live here? We'll die of thirst As the deer yearns for water, so my soul invokes you, Lord My soul is thirsty for God, for the living God Nothing Nothing Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing - Do you love me? - Yes Me no. For me to love you, you've got to be better The four masters of the gun live in this desert l must find them and kill them The desert is round. To find the 4 masters we must move in a spiral l can't go on, let's go back! l always end up where l started We'll never find them lf they're masters, they'll give us a sign Days have passed...weeks, months - How can you still have faith? - They're waiting for us The sign! Seek the light at midday. He'll come. You must wait to see him Like that woman The master didn't want to fight her The master wants to receive you know. lt's strange... he never receives people without making them wait There's an oasis behind the dune Your woman will wait there Let's go Give me the gun and the sombrero l don't need the light. l'm blind Count to three and try to take it One... two...three! How? l do not try to win, but to arrive at perfect control to not be afraid of the bullets Shoot! They hardly bleed. l offer no resistance to the bullet l let it pass through the capillaries of my flesh You still want to duel with me? Yes lt does not grieve me to kill you, because death does not exist l will let you shoot first - He's superior to me - You'll win! Even if l won, l'd lose l'm asking you a favour. You must win Don't be so honest. Try to invent something Lay a trap. There's always a way to win. Find it! l told you! l expected it, l'm proud of you! There are only 3 masters left l know where the 2nd lives. lf you let me come with you, l'll show you He's here, wait for me We were waiting for you. The cards say this about you You're falling and you'll fall anyway The deeper you fall, the higher you'll get Traitor, coward, murderer! God's will is unexplainable My son and l must respect you You can duel with him Cross! The duel starts right now You and my son can shoot when you want Dead! Technically you're dead Now l want to talk to the dead one Follow me First of all, l made things out of copper and l strengthened my fingers Now l make delicate objects l'm so strong that l can play with this shape without breaking it Shoot! A clean, delicate shot destroys an accurate one You shoot to find yourself, l do it to shoot Perfection is to lose yourself and to lose yourself you need to love You don't love. You destroy, kill and no one loves you Because when you think you're giving, you're really taking l've given myself to her. l told her everything She's inside me Her infinite love fills me What l do and say is ordered and blessed by her l hate all that is mine, because it distances me from her divine presence Two are better than one, because if they fall, one will lift up his companion When there is only one, there is no one to lift him up When l made this, l didn't think it would be useful l just tried to make it the best way l possibly could Take your gun again My son wants to give you one last chance PROPHETS l don't want you to go near him Why do you follow us? Go away! We don't need to take your gun away. We trust you You have a flute! We'll get to know each other through music You're disgusted at yourself. You don't want to betray any more Now you want to respect the law Some give flowers. Some, precious objects You bring me your life as a gift You are not afraid to die This is why you are a dangerous enemy When you were 7 metres from the rabbit run, my rabbits started to die. Now they're nearly all dead Now that you're here, not one will be left alive l made it. Feel how fine it is... You can fire a shot lt is all that l need. A fatal shot Shoot! Which did you kill and which did l kill? This is yours: shot in the head. This is mine: shot in the heart The heart...the head... A changing of places lt is now time Too much perfection is a mistake You won! Don't leave me! You'll be the best and l'll help you! There's only one left! Want to duel with me? How will l do that? l have no gun l bartered the pistol for a butterfly net l must fight you with my hands Fight! Fight! Fight! See? My net is more powerful than your bullets lf you shoot again, l'll reflect the bullet directly into your heart How can you win if l don't duel? l have nothing Even with a trap you couldn't have taken anything from me Yes, actually. l could have taken your life l don't care about my life Now l'll show you You lost You won! You won! You're the best! l was poured out like water and my bones were all detached lt's like my heart shrivelled inside my guts My tongue cleaved to my palate And they put me in the dust of the dead My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from my salvation and from the voice of my lament? My God, l call you by day but you do not answer l call by night and there is no peace Him or me Show me your way, your paths Show me the way of your truth Because you are the God of my salvation and l waited for you You will show your sinners the way You will put the humble on the path of justice PSALMS l am not a god. l am a man How long have l been here? When you got here, l hadn't been born l looked after you from infancy. The old woman says you'll free us Come We've been prisoners in this cave for many years That's the only exit. To get there we need to scale the walls and many days Outside there's the mountain and a big village They won't help us get out We're deformed from continuous incest. We disgust them lt was difficult to bring me here. Why did you do it? The old woman knows She sent us to find you. Now she wants to see you This is not my face! This is not me! l'll find money and dig a tunnel in the mountain The tunnel will unite the village and this cave When the tunnel is finished, you'll finally be free You'll get out of here This is the big village We should beg See to my curls! Paint my nails! The cream Fan This pervert is looking at my legs! Help! He's forcing himself on me! You saw him kiss me roughly! Disgusting slave! How dare you? Help, he's raping us! Don't let him get away! Murderer! Bring him here! Rapist! You're really degenerate! Get him! Get him! Murderer! Murderer! You think it's worthwhile for my people to come here? This is worse than the other l'll keep digging How many metres have we dug now? There's more to go! We've lost our public Hey, monsters! Monsters, come here! Come on, come here! We'll pay you well They're both dead - Who died first? - This one He's the champion! Protect us, Lord Protect us, Lord Protect us, Lord Protect us, Lord God loves us!

We're getting married, Father No, you can't kill him! He hasn't finished his work! ...and he promised to dig the tunnel so we can be free l'll wait till you finish the work. Then l'll kill you But l'll watch you day and night so you won't escape You'll never finish! You're taking too long lf you want us to hurry, help us to finish And if you want to finish quickly... help us to beg This rock's too hard. We've hit it a thousand times! Only 1 ,000 times? The pain must be unbearable My body feels pain. Not l You'll never do it. That's enough! You've done it! - You've done it! - Don't tell him! l'm not ready! l can't kill my master
