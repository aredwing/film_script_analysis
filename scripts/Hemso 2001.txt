It's unmoral for you to live unless you do your part. - How's that? Am I good? - Your marksmanship is superb. What matters is this. You'll look the enemy in the eye. You'll look him in the eye... ...to fill his heart with fear. He should fear you just as glass fears the stone. Remember. Your enemy may beg you. Don't pity him. Pity is the biggest danger. Cebrail, don't! You should be merciless against your enemy... ...but not against the weak. A brave man won't shoot the weak. Even if the weak one is your blood enemy, you should help them. If he's on the ground, you should help him on his feet. If he's oppressed, you should save him from his oppressors. If he's wounded you should heal him. The stronger your enemy, the greater you will be. A brave man is remembered by his enemies. Yes, mate? Did the index fall? That's bad. What do the technical analysis suggest? Buy Alcatel shares then. Alright, mate. Good evening. Uncle Cebrail. Do you know what happenned today? Hush! Eat up! - What happened? - Zlfikar from Istanbul called. Listen to dad! - What did Zlfikar say? - Our blood enemy Yaar... - ... has returned from Romania. - I said shut up! Did Zlfikar see our blood enemy Yaar? Yes. So what? What do you mean? Shall we not revenge our father's blood? Are you nuts? What's past is past. That bastard completed his sentence in jail. What's the use of revenging your father? Will it make us proud? - At least you shouldn't say that mom. - Why? Your father was a skinny, sick man. If that poor guy didn't shoot him... - ... he'd have died on his own. - We're entering a new millenium and you're talking of a blood feud! - Where's my father's bloody shirt? - Which bloody shirt? - How many does he have? The one he wore when he was shot. Oh, that one. I've washed it and made a t-shirt of it for Tolga. Are you crazy? What are you looking for? Where's the gun? Where's father's gun? Halil sold it to buy a mobile phone. Bro, what's this fuss? With what am I going to shoot... - ... my blood enemy in Istanbul? - Everyone in the village says... that you and grandpa are nuts! Are you going to save the country? That Zlfikar is a maniac too. How can you trust his word? You have no respect for the code anymore. What are you talking about? According to the code... ...it's my right to take revenge. And I'm waiving my right. Father gave the charm to me when he was shot. What he meant was "You're taking the charm, you'll take my revenge. " I've waited 20 years for this day. It's time now. Code?! Fuck your code! Uncle Cebrail! Could you bring me a leather ball from Istanbul? Yellow-red, Galatasaray colours. They don't sell those here. I'll get your ball after I've revenged our blood. - Who's there? - It's me, Grandpa! - What's up Cebrail? - I have good news. Our enemy Yaar has returned from Romania. - Zlfikar has seen him in Istanbul. - Thank goodness! The time has come. What are you waiting for? - I need your gun. - What happened to your father's? Brother Halil sold it and bought a mobile phone. Lousy bastard! Your brother is just as low as your mom. But you're different, you're like your father. You're brave. It's time now. Finally God has favoured us. You'll find your blood enemy Yaar and kill him. Find Zlfikar in Istanbul. He's brave, a man of his word. He'll help you. Cebrail, this is my money for my grave. Use it for the journey. Don't you forget. Never lose your solidity. Keep your hate sharp all the time. There are rules for killing your blood enemy. - What are you doing? - I'm fine. And you? Stop joking. What's that? Are you into marijuana now? What marijuana? This is henna. I'm going to sell it as marijuana. Look, this is a piece of art. - What if he finds out? - Then he'll use it on his ass. You'll get into trouble. You were not like this. You've changed a lot. - It's all for you, for us. - avu, there's no need for this. I do my best and work. That's what I'm talking about. I don't want you to do this anymore. - Well, but... - But what? Mariana is waiting for me. I'm off. A couple of days ago I had a Romanian chick. Boy, she was like a snake! I pinned her on the floor till the morning. - What you don't say? - I should become gay if it's a lie. She was breathless. She said "Zlfikar, I've wrestled with guys... ...from 70 nations but I haven't seen a man like you. " - Take care. - Good bye. - On tick again. - Alright. Zlfikar! What's up? - What do you want? - I'm from the village. I'm Mecit's son, Cebrail. Please, allow me. Mecit's son Cebrail? Welcome. - How's your father? Is he fine? - My father. Never mind. You'll tell me inside. I've heard that you've seen my blood enemy Yaar. - Where does he live? - Are you stupid? - There's no blood feud anymore. - Where have you seen Yaar? It wasn't Ahmet's cafe. Nor was it Topal's. But I've seen him. I could recognize Muharrem anywhere. - It's not Muharrem, it's Yaar. - That's what I said. - When have you seen it? - Not one week ago. Nor was it a month ago. But I recognized your... - ... blood enemy Sehmuz instantly. - Which Sehmuz? - Yaar, Yaar. - That's what I said! Never mind. Forget that now. Tell me. Is he fat or skinny? Tall or short? What does he look like? He's not short at all. Nor is he fat. He's definitely not tall. But he's not short either. But I've recognized Mahmut immediately. For heavens sake! Did you see this man or not? I told you that I saw him. Do you think the great Zlfikar would lie? I beg you to tell me. How can I find that bastard? You'll have to search, to ask for him. Look at all the cafes. I'm not going to find him for you. Should I shoot him for you too? Anyway... have a rest. A new day brings new things. Come to me if you get into trouble. I'm well known in Istanbul. Take my greetings to your dad. Take care. Please, have mercy. Please don't! - Come here you! - Please, let me explain! Stop it! Two against one! This is inhumane. This is against the code. That's a sin! Come here! I said the code! Don't you know it? What are you talking about? Fuck your code! That's fine now. Now you're equal. Go on! - Stop there, you pimp! - Is it nice to swear? You bastard! I'm going to stuff that henna in your ass. Let's play on Konyalim in the first run. I'll show you a first! You! - Is it done? - Of course it is. Like you said. - Bravo, avu. I trust only you. - Thanks brother. - Do you have the stuff? - I have. Don't you ever undermine my trust in you! - You're insulting me. - Brother Hamit. Can I have the keys to the car? They brought goods to the hardware store. - Move on! Get a hair cut! - Alright brother. Take it out. Let's see it. Here it is. This is the miracle medicine. - So you say it works? - What kind of a talk is that? Let's say your pecker is called Jabbar. - Which pecker? - That one. Just pretend. Let's say you take one of these. Your Jabbar turns into Kareem Abduljabbar. - How much is this? - This box... ...with 20 pills... It costs 200 USD. Whoa! Whoa! - Are you trying to stuff me? - When you take on of these... - ... you're going to stuff people. - You're sure? - Yes. - If it's that effective, here. Buy one more if you have another 200. Let's give it a try first. - Have a fine day. - Get lost! Hey, partner! Is your head OK? I'm sorry mate. I couldn't help you. I had an urgent business. Shut up! You let me down! I don't talk to guys like you! You're insulting me. You don't know me. I'm a fine guy. I'm cool. - Where are you from? - None of your business. Hey, partner. Just wait. Why do you get upset? I only asked where you're from. - What do you want? - What could I possibly want? avu, we lost the charge unit, could you fetch us one. - Don't worry. I'll bring you one. - Make it cheap. Wait, brother. Who are you? What are you doing? I'm looking for someone. A debt business. - What sort of a debt? - I'm here to settle the account. That's easy. - Is it? - Of course it is. We're the best in collecting the money owed. Come with me. You don't talk such things in the street. - Hold on there! - Come. I know such things. Partner, this place is where mostly the indebted come. They come here for relief. Maybe your man is here too. It could be that guy. He isn't. None of them is. How many places have we been to? You're too hasty. This is Istanbul. You can't find a debtor that easy. Be patient. For instance, look at that sucker in the back. Are you pulling my leg? How are you supposed to find anyone like this? - I'll find him on my own. - Sit. Where do you think you're going? You saved my life, do you think I'd let you go that easy? You'll be my guest tonight. We'll wine and dine. Come on. It will happen this time, you'll see. Let go. It should've happened a million times by now. I'm telling you, it's going to happen. You see these miracle pills... ...it will happen thanks to them. Let's just wait for it to effect. It's time already. Hamit, my man. - Thanks partner. - Don't mention it. I left my vallet at home. Next time you are on me. Money comes and goes. It's just a piece of paper. - What is it? - A piece of paper. You talk like a book. Next time remind me to write it down. - If only we'd found the guy. - Don't worry, we will. - How much does he owe you? - Very much. - Where are we going? - To my place. I owe you. Let's go to my place, you'll have a shower. And we'll get up early and find that infidel. Repent! It's evil to call someone infidel. Alright, then we'll find a believer. - Stop it! It doesn't work. - It will, it has to. What do you mean "It doesn't work. " You'll see. This is our mansion. - avu! Is that you? - Yes, honey! I'm home. - That's my popsy-wopsy. - Your what? - My lover. - I should leave then. Stay. Sit down. You're no stranger. Whoa, partner! You've wandered off. This is my lover, Tatiana. Tatiana, come. And this is... What was your name? - Cebrail. - I'm helping Cebrail... - to collect his money. - You're into trouble again. What trouble? I'll just help him get his money. - I should go now. - Stop talking about leaving. We'll get up early in the morning and find that scoundrel. I have to go. - How much do you charge? - You both? - Yes. - 200$. That's too much. Just a minute How much Turkish Lira is 200$? That's a lot but never mind, come. That's too much, we work hard for the money. We're workers. - We have 100 million. Would that do? - Alright then. Calm down partner. I'm just covering you. - Thanks. - Have a nice sleep. Come here, you animal. Stop! For heavens sake! What's with you? Tell me the truth. You sold Hamit those pills, right? - Kiss my corpse if you lie! - Why? I'm not a necrophile. - They were fake, right? - You think I'd give him real ones? How could I taste you then, ha? - Brother Hamit? - Yes? Can I have the keys of the car. I'm going to park it in the backstreet. Here you are. What's this outfit? All in red. Are you a joker or taxi driver. Get a hair cut. - I will, brother. - Don't answer back. Move! Takoz! Take the empy glasses. Greetings folks! And as a promotion, my regards! Your family's smuggler avu is at your service. Oh, pops! Are you still alive? Many kisses. Look at that nose! - Oh, brother Hamit. - What's up avu? Are you OK? - You look like you just got laid. - Yes, bro. You see it instantly. I've found a chick. You can't imagine how horny she is. Just ask her if she'd take it on with me once. Of course she would. Do you think she'd prefer Clinton? Such a strong, mighty, handsome guy. Has your willy become Kareem Abduljabbar? Keep it down! Everyone's going to hear it. There's your dupe. You rip him off, don't you? Brother, shame on you. Leave my dupe alone, take care of your Jabbar. - Wellcome partner. - Greetings. Come, sit down. Why did you leave so early? There's this Fevzi, my mother's relative. I was looking for him. What did your mother's relative Fevzi say to you? I've looked for him but in vain. You keep telling me... that you'll find the guy but you're just doing shit. I gave you my word. I will surely find him. First have a coffee. There's no need to hurry. Takoz, two medium coffee. You drink medium, don't you? Anyway. Hi folks. What's up? Hi. Sit down. Your fantasy girl walks around again in a fantastic way. - Is she here? - Yes. - Is there a problem avu? - No, everything is fine. - Who's the guy? - He's here to settle an account. - Just give me that. - The jacket? - What are you going to do? - Never mind. The dicky bow too. - What are you up to? - Don't bother. Take care of my friend. - Don't worry. - Will be back in a minute. What would you like to drink? - Good evening. - Good evening. While you're seated, would you like to eat our special? - What kind of special? - It's in the kitchen. - I could show it to you personally. - Right now. - Goodbye waiter. - Goodbye. Where have you been? What did you do? What do you think? I just knocked her off and got the money. - With someone else' wife? - Yes. Partner! Hey! - Why are you so pissed off? - It's a disgrace. - What is? - Why do you cheat on Tatiana? It's against the code. - avu! - What's up Arab? You bad hat! How dare you to swindle me? What kind of a girl did you sell me? You said she was a virgin? What are you talking about? She wasn't a virgin?! I swear she was virgin, no man did touch her. Many doctors and engineers wanted her but I didn't give her away. - Don't lie! She wasn't a virgin. - That's not possible. Don't bullshit me. You said she was virgin but she's used. I swear she was virgin, are you sure you're not mistaken? What kind of a mistake? Someone has used her, and she's blowing out. - Did you pop her cherry? - She's like a sister to me. I didn't even touch her. I should be a gay if I touched her. - It could be a production error. - Who popped her then? How should I know? Maybe the workers popped her while doing some tests? - I'll give you a new one. - I don't want another doll. - I want my money. - Where should I find money now? It was a high amount. I'll give you a new and fresh one. - Forget the money. Deal? - I want my money! Where should I get it at this time? Who are you? Don't make me commit a sin! Get lost! I'll show you! You're done for! Thanks Cebrail. If it weren't for you... Don't mention it. I'd never thought of that you were armed. - When you have enemies... - So it's an enemy? - I thought it was a bad debt. - He owes me, not money but blood. I'm looking for my blood enemy. You can't tell such things to anyone but you're no stranger. I'm dead. I'm done for. He came to kill me and I took him to my house. - You Turks are very hospitable. - How dare you to make fun of it? - I killed his father. - But you served for that crime. Bro, excuse me but do you have grease oil. There should be some in the closet in the hall. He's going to kill me. Do you know what it is to fear death? - Why did you kill his father? - Because his father had killed mine. - Why did his dad kill your dad? - Because my grandfather killed his. - Why did your grandfather kill his? - Are you nuts? How should I know? It's blood feud, one from them, one from us. This blood feud is like AIDS. It kills a lot of people. You're right. Now it's my turn to die. Oh, God. You're crazy. You are killing each other one by one. Bullshit. I felt so relaxed because I thougho it was over. Tough luck. The last gunman chanced upon me. Forget this blood feud, man. What will you gain from shooting him? You'll rot in jail in vain. I'm talking for your own good. Don't talk like that. I haven't slept for years after my dad was shot. I've been waiting for some news. They call me heathen. I'm this close, on his toes, how can I quit? - You'll definitely shoot him, ha? - That's the code. It's necesarry to spill blood. May the new day bring good news. Go, sleep now. Good night. I'm going to buy some things and send them with Takoz, OK? - I'm handsome, right? - Yes, very. - Hello? - Hello, avu. This is Gzde. - Brother Ahmet? - What Ahmet, man? I'm Gzde. I've missed you very much. Come over, Hamit's gone. Your order doesn't look good. We have no suitable stuff for you. Forget about the stuff. I realy need it man. I've run out of materials. I'm out of stocks. I know how to fill your stocks. Come over. You don't get me. My psychology is not suitable. It's a question of mood. I don't feel well. I'm not gonna work today, Ahmet. I'm hot and on fire, you're telling me that you don't want to. You want me to call Hamit and tell him everything? Why didn't you tell me before? I'll grab something and come over. I have to go out urgently, you hang around here. I'll find you. avu has left sister. Do you need something? Ah, yes. Could you give me the bathrobe? - Bathrobe? - Yes, bathrobe. What's a bathrobe? Bathrobe, bathrobe. - Just let me catch my breath. - You'll catch it later. I'm really desparate. - Takoz? - Yes, bro? - Is the horse Antepli favourite? - Yes. Can I have the keys? There's some delivery to that ironmonger. Go to my house. Tell my wife that I left the keys at home... - and bring them to me. - Right away. Alright. Never mind, you schmuck. I'll go myself. - Shall I go, bro? - I'll do it. What's it to you? Get a haircut. And you call yourself a man? You can't speak Turkish very well, just like me. - Are you foreigner? - I'm not from here. - I came here as a worker. - avu told me. - You are looking for somebody? - That's right. What are you going to do when you find him? We have an issue to settle. Are you going to shoot him? avu is very good at keeping secrets, ha? What will your wife and child do? You are going to serve in jail. I haven't married yet. So, I have no kids. As soon as I take care of this, those will happen too. - Is it necessary to kill him? - I have to. He killed my dad! Is there no justice in Turkey? He shot someone... ...and served his time. He was punished. - He was, but... - But what? - The code is different. - Code? Who's that? Code is everything. It's religion, it's faith. It's a sin to disrespect the code. No, way. I can't do it. I'm not in the mood. You turned up like Hamit. To hell with my luck! Come on, let's try again. What... what the fuck are you doing here? This is a misunderstanding. I can explain it all. How are you going to explain this, you bastard? I swear, I didn't do anything. I just turned out just like you. - I couldn't get it up. - The fuck you didn't! - Brother, please- - Get lost! I'll show you both! Where the hell is my gun? - I couldn't get an erection! - Shut up! - Would I ever betray you? - Where's my gun? I'm going to kill you! Don't run! Did I reserve this, ha? I'm going to get you and shoot your dick off. This is Bucareste. I was born there. This is Mariana, my friend from Bucareste. She's in Istanbul now. - Something wrong? - No. It's just Hamit. - Who's Hamit? What happened? - Hamit... Tatiana, could you leave us alone for a minute? - What? - I need to talk to Cebrail alone. I'm going to tell you something but promise not to be impulsive. - What's impulsive? - Fuck that! It's my fault. I can't tell you everything. Who knows? Maybe you'll go and shoot the guy... and then I'll have a guilty conscience. Please, tell me. Is it- No way! If I tell you that I found your blood enemy, you'll shoot him. What are you talking about? Did you find him? There you are! I knew how you'd behave. Don't insist. I won't tell you who he is. - Tell me who he is! - Do you take me for a fool? If I told you that it's Hamit you would shoot him this moment. No way! I won't tell you. Hamit! I didn't like that ass the moment I saw him. There's something wrong here. My enemy's name is not Hamit. Do you think he'd walk around as Yaar? He changed his name when he came out. He told me everything. Did this ass kill your father when he was a child? - He did. - Your dad's name was Mecit, right? - It was. - Then he served, right? - He did. - Yes. That's him. Yaar! He changed his name, so he couldn't be tracked. He heard that you're here. He's scared to death. He knows that we're close. He begged me. He wanted me to ask you to give this thing up. He's right. There's no thing such as bloodfeud any more. Why should you shoot him? Let him be. Why should you shoot him? You'll rot in jail in vain. Cebrail, don't do it. Let it go. Forget the bloodfeud. Let that asshole live. His house is 2 blocks from the cofeehouse. Number 14. How could you cheat on a man like me? Don't be silly. Would your wife ever cheat on you? That's what I'm tellin you. Why would my wife... ...who's married to a man like me would betray me? - How could you? - That's what I'm telling you. How could a man like you be betrayed? Cut the crap! Look, Gzde. According to our code I have to kill you. Kill me Hamit. - Pull the trigger. - Trigger? Kill me, Hamit. Pop me. - Pop? - Pop me. Gzde. It'll work this time. Come. Say your last prayer, Yaar. Yaar?! Who's Yaar? Drop your gun. Drop it! Where did you come from. Is this a motel, or what? I supressed my fury all the time. I was waiting for you to come out. - You killed my dad. - I don't know your dad. Why should I kill him? And my name is Hamit. Shame on you! So, my bloodenemy is a coward, ha? - Be a little man, Yaar. - You keep calling me Yaar. I'm Hamit. Let me show you my ID. Don't move. I swear to God, my name is Hamit. Here, look. Do I look stupid? You probably changed your name. - Where are you from? - Thessaloniki. I'm a migrant. My parents brought me here when I was a kid. How could I change my name by myself. Look. I have the water payment documents and title deeds. - Here, look. - Give me that! It says Hamit. - Father's name, Haydar, ha? - Yes, and mother's name Fatma. - Have you ever been in jail? - No. - Why were you in Romania? - I've never been there. My parents brought me here when I was a kid. Never been in Romania. You're lying! avu told me that you came from Romania! That fag! It's him who came from Romania. - He? - Yes. Why are you calling him avu? Doesn't he have a name? I'm sure he has. We called him Cavusesku when he arrived... ...then made it short, avu. - So, he came from Romania? - Yes. What have I done? Damn it. - What's this face? - Never mind. - Give me another beer. - Your fantasy woman came. - She asked for you 10 minutes ago. - Why didn't I see her? You don't sit still for a minute. She's raving for fantasies again. And I'm craving for money. Where's she now? In there. - Good evening, lady. - Good evening. Is there a problem? You know, problems need to be solved. You're very kind. I needed some cash but my ATM card broke. - Could you help me? - Well, of course. It's an honour for me to help such a beautiful lady. Let's go. Let me show you how it is done. We stick it in here. Yes, it says 'start'. - What if somebody sees us? - Just a sec. Wrong insert Use it the other way The operation continues Please press 'yes' if you wish to continue. Yes. Yes. There's no money on your account. It says there's no money on your account. Stop right there. Brother Hamit. You're alive! Of course I'm alive. But you're going to die, you scum! - Look. I can explain everything! - What possibly could you explain? Look. It's not the way it looks. And you send someone to kill me. You're done for! Bravo partner! Great timing! Did you see that? Don't mess with us. - Didn't you shoot him? - Say your last prayer, Yaar. Yaar? Cebrail? Is that you? - What are you doing here? - I'm going to open a rice shop. - What are you doing here? - Killing my bloodenemy. You bastard. Running is against the code. Turn around. Look me in the eye. Don't shoot. Please, don't shoot me! I was only 14. I couldn't think. Please, have mercy. Stop whining. My enemy should die like a man. What happened? Why did you give up? I didn't. You can't kill your enemy during the call for prayer. Come on, hurry up. Dear God, I'll join the first Friday prayers. Tatiana? Can you hear me? We have to meet right away. Yes. That goddamn fool... Cebrail. He found out that I'm his bloodenemy. Yes, are you nuts? Our live is in danger. Yours too. Come in front of McDonalds. It's difficult to kill someone in this town. My enemy... turned out to be a coward. It wasn't always like this. In the old days you ambushed your enemy, they showed no fear. They bravely waited for their end. And when your gun jammed... - ... they would give you their own. - Don't make things up. There's no thing as blood feud any more. Courage, handing over weapons? Your grandfather makes these up. Repent! What took you so long? Could you excuse us for a second? The situation is very serious. That redneck we mocked... ...turns out to be a real maniac. We have to run. - Where to? - Not far. We'll move to Kurtulu. - Then he may return to his village. - We have no money. Don't worry about that. I'll borrow from a friend. avu, look. - How did they just bob up? - Let's see the ladies' passports. - Are you selling them? - Do you take me for a pimp? They are hanging around by themselves. - Their visa has expired. - She could be easily deported. Come on, brother. Couldn't you just overlook it? They are just earning money to make a living. - Can't you overlook it for once? - Alright then. - We won't report them. - Thank you very much. - But, we'll keep the passports. - I guess we need a favor... - ... in return by these whores. - What do you mean? Don't act stupid. We did you favor and they will please us. You bad hat. Why do get upset man? Of course they will. Tell them to get in the car. In the morning, at the park. You didn't marry because of your grandfather. Tell me, is there someone you like? - Actually, there is one. - Tell me. Who's she? What does she look like? Her eyes are like the river Tigris. When you look at them too much... ...you fear to get drowned. Her lips are like a butterfly on her face. You'd fear to kill the butterfly, if you touched the lips. Her hands are like two gazelles, a mother and its baby. If you touched her, you'd fear to orphan the baby. What about her hair? It's like a flock of birds flying over the walls of Diyarbakir castle. If you longed to touch one strand of it... ...you'd fear to fall from the walls. Cebrail. This is no way to walk. You are completely in love. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did you get the passports? - They didn't give them. - Let's go away. - Where to? We have a life here. - What would I do in another town? - We came here full of hope. - We had nothing but trouble. - You're right. Have some patience. As soon as we get rid of Cebrail then it will be easy. I don't want trouble. I want happiness. As soon as we get rid of that maniac we'll live like kings. - First we should move. - Again? We have to. He's obsessed with me. If he finds me... - We need money. - Don't worry about that. I'll handle it. Then everything will be super. - Let's get on that ship and go. - Don't worry. We'll do that too. - What's up? - The fantasy boy is here. - What do you think you're doing? - We should do it inside. We'll do it later. - Damn me! - Fuck off, you goddamned. I need money. What the hell? You call this driving? Is it your dad's car? - I saw that asshole avu. - Where? Get in. Move! - What's up, avu? - Fine. It's a small world. Look, we met again. - Or should I call you Yaar? - But bro... just a minute. - I can explain it all. - He still tries to explain. - How could you do that to my wife? - Hamit... fuck you man. I'm going to fuck you. Don't move. Don't move. - Are you some sort of a bad curse? - Piss off. Don't make me mad! Alright. I didn't say a thing. avu, brother. Please, don't die. - Man, I'm dying. - Don't die. Wait, I'm coming. Stop! - You murderer! You killed him. - Stop it Tatiana. I didn't shoot him. - Shut up! Liar! Killer! - Hamit shot him. - You didn't? - Hamit shot him. I should've stopped him but I was too late. How is he? Is he going to live? He lost too much blood. We need to find blood. - Any damage in the thorax? - No. That's a relief. - What's his blood group? - 0 Rh negative. It's very difficult to find this blood. If we can't find it, he'll die. Nothing seems to go by the book. I'm donating blood... ...for my bloodenemy. Doctor, how's the patient? Did my blood do any good? - He's much better. - When will he become conscious? In a couple of hours. Are you from our profession? - Yes, I studied medicine. - If there are no complications... ...he'll wake up in a few hours. But he's post-op... ...he has to stay here a couple of days. Thank you. - What did he say? - Let's talk in the garden. He'll be better in a few days. This wicked world has its strange ways. You can never know what destiny will bring along. - I didn't understand? - My grandfather's saying. - So you work as doctor at night? - No, not here. In Romania. - You left your country. Why? - I met avu in Romania. I fell in love. We came together. It would be good for you if you work as doctor. You need residence permit. You have to be Turkish citizen. It's very expensive. I save up but it's not enough. I'll find you money. I'll let the village know about the situation. - My grandpa will send it. - I don't understand. You donated blood for avu and now you'll give me money? That's different. You're different. You're not a killer. You can't take life. You're not a killer if you kill your bloodenemy. I have to get the passports. Take care of avu. As you wish. I told you. He'll be alright in a few day. Thanks doc. When will he be completely fine? - Won't take more than a week. - So, I can shoot him? Tatiana told me that you were the donor. - It just happened. - What are you trying to do? You came to kill me. You saved my life many times. I got shot, you took me to the hospital and gave me blood. And now you're staying with me. Are you making fun of me? That's the code. If your enemy is starving... ...ill or in need, you can't shoot him. You should help him. You're really nuts. Don't laugh. If the code says... ...you should help me, then do so. I have to go to the bathroom. Don't look like that. Come on. I would go by myself if I could. Come on. Slow. Rest a little. Don't tire yourself up. There's no place like home. Partner, could you get it? - Who are you looking for? - Who are you? - Who the hell are you? - Get lost, redneck. - Where's my money? - Hold your horses. Don't hit me. You can't hit an ill person. There's the code. You're due with the rent for months now. You're invading my house. - Don't touch me. - He's ill. Let him be. Should I ask for permission from you? He owes me 6 months rent. - Is it really that much? - I swear I'll kill you. Don't! You know I'm always busy. But it's always on my mind. Thanks. So I'm on your mind. You... Here. Take this for the money. Nice piece. Where did you steal that from? Don't slander, man! What sort of a man are you? Don't you have no shame? Why don't you cover your debt? Why are you lying? - Why is my enemy like this? - Why are you mad at me? Is this the way the code is? I'm ill. Please go and buy me some groceries. Don't forget to buy peaches. - Hi. - Hi, sweetheart. Tati. Tati, what's up? - You're completely fine. - Cebrail will be overjoyed. I'm joking. Don't tell Cebrail, he'd kill me that moment. - He wouldn't hurt an ant. - As long as it's not his enemy. - I'm going to ask you something. - Anything you wish. - Why did Hamit shoot you? - He's insane. When the pills I sold him were no good he got mad at me. You're lying. I know why! - Why should I lie? - Didn't he bust you with his wife? I swear it's a lie! Who makes these up? - Kemal told me. The cab driver. - That pimp. - So, it's true? - No, I swear it's not. Don't touch me. You're lying. You banged Gzde. Yes, I did. So what? You're sleeping with men all the time! Yes, I do. But for what? For money, for our future. And you? You're lying and cheating on me. I don't lie to you. I'm gone. God damn me. What's up? Are you in pain? Tatiana has left me. She left me. What am I going to do without her? I can't live. - Maybe she'll come back. - She won't. I did a very stupid thing. What am I going to do without her? I want to die. - You wanted to shoot me, right? - Yes. I'm not ill. I was just pretending. Come on, shoot me. - No way. - Why? Kill me now. - You'd do me a favor. - No way. I was going to kill you... ...to avenge my father. If I kill you now, it would be a favor. - That wouldn't be revenge. - Are you nuts? What difference does it make? You would kill your enemy. Let me explain. The caliph Ali, God's lion... You know caliph Ali, right? During war, he knocked down a soldier. He stepped on him and raised his sword. Just as he was about to... .. strike, the enemy spit on his face. Ali, lowered his sword. The enemy soldier was baffled and asked "Why didn't you kill me?" Ali said, "I was going to kill you in the name of God. If I kill you now, it would be personal. - And the infidel became a muslim. - So what? - We can't kill upon request. - What about me? - I can't live without Tatiana. - Don't worry. I'll get her back. - Come. - I'm leaving. Homey. Thanks. I'll tell you something but don't get mad. - I won't. - I heard that there's a sorcerer. He's very powerful they say. If he'd blow you... Get lost. I've had it enough. You'll get one in the head. So? You can only stand up to me. You told me that you shot avu. - He's healthy and at home. - You're staying at home... ...but know everything. This time I'll kill him. Yaar. - Hey, partner? - I've had it. I'm scared to death that someone else is going to kill you. - Don't move. - You can't shoot me. I'm not healed yet. There's a sudden pain. - Don't try to trick me. - What are you talking about? You're time has come. Don't do that. It's a sin. Dont use ezan. You'll get damned. How was the rest? Don't do it. I had my punishment. I spent years in jail. Don't do it. And when I was released I feared everyday that I'd be shot. Your dad died once but I died a thousand times. Please, put that down. Stop whining like a woman and say your last prayer. - Back off! Or I'll jump down. - I'll shoot you if you jump. - I'll jump if you shoot me. - How are you going to jump... - ... when I shoot you? - How are you going to shoot me... ...after I jump. They'll say that Cebrail's enemy killed himself. - You'll lose your face. - Please don't do that. - You'll be smithered to pieces. - It's better than dying every day. - Don't! - Farewell partner. My enemy escaped again. Heaven forbid... ...how am going to keep my face if I return without killing him? - As if they cared. - How am I going to look... ...grandpa in the eye? Grandpa will be proud of me... ...when I shoot Yaar. By the way, I got a call from the village today. - Did Halil call? - No. - Your grandpa died. - What are you saying? He passed away yesterday. - Are you serious? - May he rest in peace. Crazy he was, but still a good guy. Take a sip. - Here, take some. - No. - Come here. - Let go. Let's do it again. - I'm going too. - Where to? Don't piss me off. The show has just begun. I'm a little mouse, first I blow then I devour. Boss. Cut that. You'll cause an accident. Look now. - Open your mouth. - I don't want to. Open it. Boss. Look at this position! What have you done? Fuck! What have you done? She's dead. - My finger slipped. - What do you mean? Why didn't you just fuck her? - Where did we find these whores? - It's all because of you. - We're done for. - It was an accident. Do you think that I wanted to kill that bitch? Could've happened to you too. Boss. Where's the other? Where's the other whore? She's not here. - She ran away. - God damn it. It's my fault. We'll be damned if the speaks. - What are we going to do? - We'll find and kill her. - What about the one inside? - We'll handle it. It's all because of you. - Shit. - Are you stealing your own stuff? There's no escape any more. What could I possibly say? Don't look down. Look me in the eye. - Do you know the field at Dogtepe? - I know. That's were you shot my dad. I saw him fall. - I swore to kill you like that. - We could go to the village. You'll shoot me at the place where I shot your dad. I swear I won't run. We had good days. I wish I hadn't found you. Forgive me. Undercover policemen killed Mariana. They shot her. - They are after me. - We're in deep shit. - What are we going to do? - We have to run. What are you looking at? Move. avu, stop right there! Good evening. Didn't I tell you that we'd meet again. - Hamit, I can explain. - Don't move. How could you do that to my wife? Don't try to be a hero. avu, it's them. Hey, wait for your turn. First I'll kill them, then you. - Get lost. - Behave, man! I'll kill you. You bastard! Bastard! Move. - How's your arm? - It's not serious. They are running away. Gzde. Why did they shoot him? It was during the call for prayer. They are not like you. They are coming. - Shit. - Where are they? - They have vanished. - Where are they, ha? This way, I'm sure. It's coming from upstairs. Hurry. avu, I'm tired. I can't run all night long. Where should we go? They would find us. - They'll kill me. - Shit. What are we going to do? Come along. Welcome. Welcome. - We're here tonight. - You're utmost welcome. I couldn't recognize them. Are they from our hometown? - They are from Istanbul. - Welcome. - Looks like we made it. - Let me prepare you tea. I'll help him. There's a white car. - The Renault? - Don't know. It was white. - We have to find a way out. - But how? I have friends at the harbor. They could arrange a ship for us. You think I'm stupid. So, you're going to run? What kind of a talk is that? You think I'd leave Tatiana and run? - You really don't know me. - avu won't run. If Tatiana was your lover, would you run? Don't talk like that. I mean it. If Tatiana was your lover, would you leave her and run? - Go. - That's fine. I'll be back soon. Take it. - Take care. - Thanks. Homey. Thanks. - Eat something. - I have no apetite. - Don't worry, he'll return. - He would, wouldn't he. - What happened? - I handled it. Recai cleaned the room. Don't worry. - Did they come? - No. And they won't. Let's drive about. Maybe we'll find them. Good idea, let's go. Cebrail, is this the girl with eyes looking like the Tigris? Why didn't you tell me that your lover is Romanian? - You lousy scoundrel. - She's not my lover. Isn't she that girl you told me about? No. She's... Yaar's. She's avu's lover. - Who is it? - Open the door. It's me. The police is everywhere. There are many in undercover. If they blame us for Hamit's murder were done for. - Did you arrange the ship? - Yes. The captain shied away... .. but I insisted. He'll take us away. - A new morning a new beginning. - I'm going to bed. - Good night. - Go have some sleep. - You? - I'll stand watch. - Good night. So, 'Wrestler' Zlfikar? Are you still wrestling? Yep. I haven't slept for two days. - Isn't that too much? - What was her name, Nadia? I dumped her long time ago. This one's new. - You said she was fine. - Yes, but a little skinny. Now I found a Romanian called Tatiana. She's like a snake. Stop laughing. Give me 2 more bread. This is not enough. Yes, wrestling till the morning is not easy. On the tick. Can I help you? Get up. Shit! Tatiana, come. We're leaving. Come partner. They are here. Upstairs! - They are after us. - I'll hold the door. Open the door! - They are going to kill me! - Calm down! Where the hell are they? Stay here! - Drop the bag! - I can't. It's important. Where are these assholes? - Thanks. - Never mind. We're partners. They are armed. Run! I'll cover you. They are running. This way! Hurry! Move! What a neighborhood. Just like Holywood. - Gunfight. Car theft. - Just like in the movies. You jerk! That was your car. - Is it this car? - It is. They are here. - Which way? - This way. Come, this way. - There. That's our ship. - It's big. I have something to tell you. Move! Partner! You're shot. - I'm fine. - You're shot. - Hold on. - Go to the ship. What the hell are they doing? Do they think this is a game? The guy with the beard was shot. - Go now. - We can't leave you. Take the back. Partner! Are you ok? Take this. Open your eyes. You can't die! You must shoot me first! Bastard! What sort of a thing is this?
