They were initiated into the dangerous art of the occult and during a session awakened a being far beyond their control. The result of their boldness: The beautiful Leonor was sacrificed. Her bloodline would be forever joined to the curse known as "The Valdemar Legacy. " The Valdemar house remained sealed for years. No one dared go inside. Until two weeks ago, when an expert historian fascinated by its secrets ventured into the mansion. He was never heard from again. The legend was brought back to life and new faces appeared in the story. Luisa Llorente, an estate valuer sent to finish the work of her predecessor, found out what happened to him and met the mansion's caretaker. She would later escape, but her whereabouts remain unknown. Four days after she went missing, her boss, Maximilian Colvin, hired detective Nicolas Tramel to find her and put an end to these strange disappearances. Tramel set off on a bizarre journey to the house with Doctor Nora Cervia, Maximilian's assistant, who told him about the Valdemar legend although she withheld certain secrets from him. A similar fate awaits Eduardo and Ana, Luisa's co-workers, who don't understand why the police haven't been involved or why Maximilian has ordered them to join the search immediately, leaving that very night forthe Valdemar house. A mystery hidden in the shadows, and the most horrible of all... grows near. THE FORBIDDEN SHADOW Are we almost there, honey? Civilization is nowhere in sight. They probably speak a different language out here. Ana, what's wrong? Did I say something? No, honey, really. We haven't done anything together in three months. I was hoping this weekend... I know. This is just something that happened. - After we find Luisa... - That's another thing. I don't mean her, it's just... I don't like how quiet they're keeping this. Inmoberance has always kept a low profile. We did sign a confidentiality clause. The pay is great, the pension couldn't be better... But no questions asked. What if we do ask? What would be the answer? Two cover-ups, no statements, two people missing... We're probably exaggerating. Luisa isn't a child. Watch out! Are you okay? Yeah. - Where are you going? - Stay here. - Don't leave me. - Hold on. Shit. Use your cell, call for help! Ana, what is it? You were telling me about last year. And after the divorce? I was in Naples working on the "Monster of Florence" case, and then I came here. I opened my own detective agency and... I think you know more about me now, than my own therapist. It's your turn. You want to hear about me? I'm warning you, my life isn't nearly as exciting as yours. I was just hoping that... ...we could set aside the formalities and be a little more cordial. We're having dinner. Okay. Tell me about the etchings at the end of the book. I thought your job was clear. Find a missing woman. The other distractions are irrelevant. And I thought you were obliged to help me - in any way you could. - All right. Anything to not have to listen to you groan the whole way. Let's make a new deal. I'll tell you more about the past if we focus on the present. I want to hear how you plan to continue investigating. Great. It's a deal. Where am I? My head... It's okay. You're safe. My name is Selene. You had quite a fall. This area is full of ditches and caves, but you were lucky. It's just a scratch. But you're still weak. I made you some lemon balm and natural boldo. It will make you strong again. Please, don't trouble yourself. I can't stay. Go ahead. It's five miles of forest in every direction. The only path leads to a large abandoned house. But you've already been there, haven't you? What do you want from me? I don't have anything. Don't be ridiculous. What would I want from you? If you leave, they'll find you. And trust me, they won't be as nice. - How do you know? - That they're after you? Because you're not the first. But we'll make sure you're the last. After the Valdemar tragedy, Lazaro tried to get his life back. But instead of managing his fortune intelligently, he invested all his capital in a strange, forbidden book. Sir, you haven't eaten in days. For God's sake. This can't go on. What you're doing is blasphemy. An abomination. I'll end up having to bury her somewhere else. Get out of here. Get out. Sir, I've served you since you were a child. I saw you grow up and become a man. But you're a stranger to me now. And you scare me just as much as the room you made me board up. Get out! Yes, sir. I'll go. But first I have one thing to say. She chose to die with pride. She sacrificed everything for you. She devoted her last breaths to you. Believe me, she wouldn't want to see what you're turning into. Get out of here. I said get out. Never speak her name again. Never. Yes, sir. I'm leaving. She isn't dead. You hear me, Jervas? Leonor isn't dead! I know what you mean. The Necronomicon. The Book of the Dead. It has... almost 10 pages about him. Exactly. He may have been persecuted by the Church, but he wasn't a Satanist or anti- clerical. His cult was based on the so-called Great Old Ones, Gods that precede any religion. After searching for years, he was finally able to buy it from some merchants in northern Iran. What was never clear is why he wanted it. Maybe he had new plans he thought it could help him with. Right after that, he regained his wealth and returned to high society. Hello! Good evening. Welcome. Good evening. How are you? Good evening. Good evening. I love the way you decorated. Thank you. Obviously a feminine touch. If you'll excuse me... Gentlemen. Get your brother out of here. How rude! - Who is that? - I don't know. Lovecraft. Come with me. What are you doing here? I don't recall inviting you. Is that what bothers you, or that I came? What do you want? Wherever I go... Istanbul, Prague, Tehran... Stop following me. I'll never give you the Necronomicon. I don't want you to. I'm not here to ask you for it, but to free you from it. Money is no object, of course. I'll pay anything you ask. The problem is, I have no intention of parting with it. Is that so? Could I at least examine it? Just for a moment. Then I'll go. Definitely the real thing. One of a kind. I lied to you. I can't afford to buy it. Not even a fraction of it's value. It's no secret you're broke, Lovecraft. Everyone knows that. Then you also know I've dedicated my life to studying the Necronomicon. Many a careless person thought he could use it to make money. Isn't that your case? Not at all. I shall be its only owner. Utter foolishness, my dear friend. Indeed it is the book that owns you. Before I leave, here's some advice about how to use it correctly. There's a universal code that equally affects all the occult. One simple rule. "The laws of Nature cannot be altered. " Please, allow me to demonstrate. This is a simple levitation trick. Yes, the book floats. But it is bound by the forces of Nature: Gravity and weight remain. And yes, it is enshrouded by magic, but its effect is exclusive. Gravity, the essence of Nature, can never disappear. When the spell wears off the book once again depends on its own weight. Very good. Thanks for the trick. Trust me, I've seen more spectacular displays. Now please return the book to me. I've been far too tolerant with you. Incredible. You offer advice and end up lecturing me. Enough is enough. Please leave my home. - I have guests to attend to. - How odd. You're just like the others. You neither listen nor learn. You're oblivious to the forces you're dealing with, and you don't care. This isn't mysticism, it's demonology. No one, absolutely no one who has handled that book has survived. I've warned you a thousand times and you always reject me, making things more complicated. Mysteries and secrets are everything to you. - Secrets and mysteries. - They aren't the same thing? No. Absolutely not. Mysteries are wonders that can be pondered and shared. Secrets are a heavy burden people carry by themselves. That's your problem. A heavy burden on your shoulders. It's nothing compared to what's in store for you. Nothing! - Any luck? - Were you listening? I was praying quietly, asking God to restore sanity to all this. You must be Jervas, the man who wrote to me these last months and asked me to come. Yes. Please forgive my boldness, but you're my last hope. I told my master not to bother with all this, that all this fear was unnecessary. But. I can't get through to him. I've never seen him like this. He rejected the help of his friends and took refuge in the comfort of the unknown. Then there will be plenty to fear. I warned him, in any case. There is a great deal at stake. He's lucky to have a guardian angel like yourself. But he must see the fine line between perseverance and sheer stupidity. I'm sorry, sir. Good evening. Thank you, Mr. Lovecraft. Goodbye. - They didn't hit it off. - No. Oddly enough, because Lazaro was the best of hosts. He treated his guests exquisitely. Then what happened? How did it end? You think we'd be here if it were over? Nothing will happen to you. What is that? I'm sorry, I'm pretty skeptical about this stuff. You don't need to believe, but I must understand. Choose seven cards. There are three parts to Tarot: Recent past, present and immediate future. Each part determines the next. The first thing we need to see is your recent past. It marks the tone of the questioner. Intelligence over brute force, morality, tranquility. Continue. The second card shows your situation in the recent past. - The house. - It means the end of fortune, adversity, chaos, professional issues. Four days ago I was called to value an old house, that's when it all began. Not yet. Don't tell me anything yet. Pick up the third card. People who have influenced you lately. Acts of evil, hatred, perversion. It all coincides, doesn't it? - Yes. - Good. Now you must tell me everything, from the beginning. Our stop. - Are you okay? - Yes. Let me see. It doesn't look bad. Trust me, I've twisted my ankle a hundred times. - Does it hurt to put weight on it? - No. Well? Are you taking advantage to get closer to me? No first names, but I can stroke your leg? Fine. No problem. So what do we do now? There's nobody around. Except him. We'll walk, it's not far. The next day, I woke up in a strange boarding house. No telephone, no explanations, nothing. So I tried to Find a ride into town. Hello? Is anybody here? Damaso, don't be angry. It really hurts. You scared me. I thought I was alone. I thought you were Damaso. What are you doing here? I was looking for a ride into town. I think the car keys are around here. Thank you. What are all these photographs? People who have been through here. I collect them. They were all friends of mine. There are 180 in all. All friends of yours? That's a whole lot. Yeah, 180. Nice number, huh? It sure is. Trust me, numbers are important. We all have one. If you give me a photo, I'll post it. You'd be number 181. What about these children? They're police photos. Missing people, hikers. The rough terrain. It's easy to get lost around here. Look. I volunteer for search parties. Sometimes the police come and study them to help with their cases. All these missing people... I can't believe this hasn't gotten out. Have you called the press? What for? What do you mean? To investigate. They have no respect for anything or anyone. - No, but. - Yeah, they've been here. All they do is lie and make up stuff. They don't care what happens. They just want an excuse to snoop around inside the house. Shit... Are you okay? Yeah, sometimes my head... What about them wanting to get in the house? Do you think maybe they already have? - Don't you think? - What? Something may have happened to them. If they minded their own business, nothing would. The fucking keys are gone. What's the problem? I don't understand. You've been nice to me, - why not to them? - It's different. You came here to work, not to meddle. You asked permission, treated me with respect, you were nice. The others are fucking brats. They don't give a shit. I'm glad what happened did, they deserved it. What do you mean? What happened to them? You're smart. Take a guess. No... That's impossible. If something had happened to them they would have found remains. Bodies don't disappear just like that. And the leftovers of the chicken you ate last night? Where are they? What's the matter? What is it? I didn't take my medicine. I need my hearing aid. My ears ring constantly. You'll find something for the pain in that cupboard. And for the voices. Take any of them. The ones in the white bottle calm me down. These are for animals. Give me the fucking pills! No! Don't take them! What are you doing? - You want to kill yourself? - Don't shout at me! You know what you just took? These could kill you. They're for animals, for horses! God... No. What did you say? Tell her the truth. I said no at first. But they made me eat them during my initiation. You can't imagine the feeling when you taste them. I don't know what you mean. It's only sometimes. When he doesn't want them. They make me. What happened to all those children? I couldn't help it. Their meat has no fat, or poison. I mean... adults... aren't bad, but children... Children are caviar. You shouldn't have come here. They'll hurt you just like the others. They'll feed you to it and then to me. You must leave! Hurry! You had to screw it up, didn't you? This is important! I've told you a thousand times. Talk, talk, talk! You know what happens to people who talk too much? What do you want? To know why she's here? She knows about the party. Everyone does! The fat guy told me. So you know what's at stake. What happened? It was Damaso. Oh my God, darling. We're so sorry. You can't go on like this. How many times has it been? Telling the truth isn't cowardly. You know he's not allowed to hurt you. This is the last time, I swear. I'm going to stand up to him. No, you aren't. Not until you admit what you are and face up to it. It's time to stop being a child. To grow up, not just get back at that bastard. You have to change your behavior, be smarter than him. Beat him at his own game. You know what you're doing isn't right. We've talked about it many times. This is your big chance to redeem yourself. She's your main concern now. She's been locked up for two days. Remember what happened yesterday? What do you want from me? You didn't help her, you backed out. That can't happen again. You have to help her, free her. Remember how she treated you? Does she deserve what she has coming? It's true, she doesn't. Act fast, while he's napping. We're running out of time. Go and then tell us everything. Okay, I will. Santi, look at me. Before youleave, I want the little boy to close his eyes... and the man to open them again. You can do it, Santiago. Finish him off! Kill him! Carve him up, into little pieces! We're proud of you. Now you're acting like a man. I have something for you before you leave. Shit! It was my second day in captivity, when suddenly... What do you want? Let me out! It's okay. It's me, - Santi. - Santi, please. Get me out of here. Keep quiet. Damaso is downstairs. Listen to me. I'll help you, but I don't have the key. So we have to pick the lock. I already tried, but I couldn't. Find a wire or a hair pin. A wire? There's nothing in here. I haven't got anything. Look under the bed. Under the bed. The springs. After the house, I fled through the forest until I reached a road. But I almost got run over by a car. I know I fell on the asphalt, but I was so dazed I couldn't recognize the driver. I managed to get away, but I fell in a ditch. The rest you know. The rest is the present. It's a bridge card that links to the immediate future. The wheel of fortune. Upside down. What is it? Is something wrong? I see sudden changes. Unfavorable, dangerous. I think you should go. They need you there. Where? At the house? Did you hear a word I said? Wait a minute. Of course. You're one of them! All this was just to keep me here, - to gain time. - No, no. That's not it, I swear. I swear. I see it all clearly in the cards. Let me explain. They... the same ones, they drugged me and stole my baby. My son! That's why I said you weren't the first. You have no idea what they're capable of. I gave birth to my baby here. By myself! I tried to protect him, but they found out about him and there was nothing I could do. I was terrified. I know he's still alive. Please. I'm not going back. But I promise... I can't walk, but I can guide you. There's a safe path, it only takes an hour. I need to know he's okay. I can't help you. I can't even help myself. But you're in time. They still haven't got the amount they need. What if I tell you a secret about what they were going to do to you? What are you talking about? Listen to me, sweetie. Listen carefully because your life is at stake. You're not here by chance. First let me say... It's them! They've found me... There's nobody here. The light is on, but. - Are you crazy? - Who are you? What do you want? Calm down! We were looking for a hotel. We got lost and we saw the light on. Put that down. Wait a minute. You're Luisa Llorente. I can't believe we found you. Everybody's looking for you. We thought you were missing. Listen, it's okay. We're from the foundation. I'm Nora Cervia, the president. And he's a cop, look. You see? Thank God! It's over. Is that better? Good. Help me wake him up and we'll figure out what to do. Please, we have to leave. We need to wake him up first. He won't wake up. I'm sorry, I'm really upset. Wake up! Come on. Please, react. Olympus calling Mars, over. This is Mars, over. - Everything okay? Over. - I can't complain. My first time in the woods and I've caught two prize specimens. By the way, did one get away? Curly blond hair, blue shirt. Over. You've got Luisa? Thank God. That fool Santiago let her go. Wait till I get my hands on him. I owe you one. Over. Remind me to collect. And don't youdare hurt Santi, you hear me? He has to be there. We'll clear things up later. I'll give you my position, come and find me. We have to carry these two. Over and out. Santi! I have a girl here with me asking for you. She stopped by to say hello. Santiago, sweetie. It's me, Nora. Please, come and say hi. It's about time. Where have you been? You shouldn't keep a lady waiting. Santi. What's wrong? Don't you want to say hello? And I thought we were friends. You're not even happy to see me? Hello, Nora. Nice to hear your voice. Finally. I thought you were avoiding me. Listen. I'll find the boss to get things ready and I'll see you soon. Big kiss. Bye. Out. I knew you'd come out if you heard her voice. That's the problem with a broken hearing aid. You can't tell a walkie-talkie from real sound. Why did you say there was a girl asking for me? Because there is. Please, don't hurt her. I'm begging you. Of course not. We're going to be great friends. It's okay. Everything will be fine, I promise. You're lucky I was specifically told not to touch you. But I want you to know what will happen if you screw me again. Please, anything you want. It won't happen again. Please, don't hurt her. Leave her alone. The things I've had to put up with over the years. You've never told me about the raunchy stuff you do. Anyway, people are into different things. I can admit that. But I will not tolerate being made a fool of in front of them. Santi, Santi, Santi. I suggest you do the right thing. Because the next head to roll won't be plastic. You'd better be ready to do your job. Wake up. It's okay, it's okay. No sudden moves. They're loose. Get your hand loose. Where are we and who are you? I'm a cop. Do you know her? Ana, wake up. Is she Luisa Llorente? The valuer? Yes. Luisa. Luisa, wake up. Ana, come on, wake up. It's okay. Don't be frightened. This room belongs to a sadist. I'm Nicolas Tramel. I'm a detective. And I've seen this before. Though never like this, with so many people. This is what we call his playroom. Somebody scares the victims and makes them beg. Then they record the moment. If you look closely, the bars and chains are fake. They create false hope and they can play over and over again. A taser gun. It's charged. Why are we here? What is this place? This must be the basement of the Valdemar mansion. How do you know? Because I was valuing the house. Why lock us in? They didn't lock us in. They kidnapped us. What do you mean? How do you know? Because I disappeared four days ago. And they locked me up, among other things. So I know what I'm talking about. God! - Who did that to you? - Damaso. The guy who locked us in here. And trust me, this is nothing compared to the rest of the place. - The day I got here I found. - Luisa, excuse me. Tell us your adventures some other time. - We need to get out of here. - Yeah, but how? Okay, everybody calm down. We don't know what they want from us. All I know is I was sent here by your boss, Maximilian Colvin. So I suggest we try to figure this out together. At least that way we'll be ready for whatever happens. All right? You mean we're somehow involved in all this? Yeah, but how? The only thing we have in common is we work together valuing historic estates. Besides, our supervisor is missing. Orquicia isn't here. - Pablo is dead. - What? What do you mean, dead? I found him in the house. Dismembered. Please! What about you? You act like you knew him. What does that matter? There's still no link between us. Well, there is now. - Is everything ready? - Yes, sir. Everything is going according to plan. No. How could I be so stupid? When they told me about the case they accidentally mentioned Orquicia was missing. I tried to find out more, but they gave me the run around and I got sidetracked. Hours of myths and legends on the train, all just to keep me from solving your case. Can you get to the point? Yeah. A few months ago, Pablo and I discovered that Inmoberance was making a series of large undetected money transfers. They were so irregular we thought we could set ourselves up with a piece of the action. The amount was always the same, one million euros, reaching a total of more than 650 million euros, ready to be transferred. All we needed was a plate to duplicate the seal used on company documents. Then, after the summer, we found part of the plate, but Pablo lost interest and said that... he had come across something much bigger, something much better than money. He never told me what it was. And I never heard from him again. Until today. After the summer. That's when we were in a meeting and that guy showed up. Remember? A strange man walked in and said we needed to value the Valdemar mansion, as soon as possible. Orquicia volunteered, and named us as his support team. Wait a minute. This is all about you two trying to embezzle money? Take it easy. And don't point at me. What we had in mind never got past the planning stage. Yeah, and what about the plates? The fat guy was capable of anything. And involving us to get rid of him isn't that far-fetched. Yeah, right. First of all, the fat guy had a name, and it was Pablo. Have the decency to not insult him in the grave. Leave me alone! First somebody tell me how the hell they found out about something that we were only considering. I can't believe I'm here because of a couple of schmucks! Take it easy! Don't even talk to her. Stop it! We all got each other into this, like a vicious circle. You, detective, got Orquicia into it, who involved us by naming us as his team. We sent Luisa to value the house, and when she went missing, you were hired to find her. Fuck! Santiago. Santi, it's me, Luisa. What are you doing? - What if he's one of them? - He is. He helped me before. But my adventures - were boring you. - Stop it. Some of us want to get out of here. Santiago, can you hear me? Luisa. They caught you again? Yeah, I'm afraid they caught us all. Then we haven't got much time. Can you open the door? Yes, I can. But if I do, I want you to do - something for me. - Anything. Okay. Here's the deal. I'll open the door and show you the way to Luisa's car. In return, you have to take someone else with you. Someone else? There are more people locked up. Promise me. - Okay, we promise. - Anything. You promised. You can't take it back. Who is this kid? Thank you, Santi! I'm not a kid, I'm a man. I can't see anything. - Here. - Thank you. Let's go. You promised. You said you'd help. Fuck the promise. I'm getting out of here. Eduardo, have you any idea what Santiago is risking for us? No, I don't. What I do know is his friends locked us up. I have no one to thank for trying to escape. Wait a minute. - Come on. This way? - Yes. - What's wrong? - I don't want to leave the group. Or you either. Come on. Honey. Let's go. Come on, quick. Okay, Santiago. That's your name, right? Santiago. I'm Nicolas. Now tell me. Who's coming with us? Someone very special. You're about to meet him. Yeah, sure. He must be. Hold on a minute. I did some bad things. I was ordered to kidnap a baby. What are you talking about? When I said no, Damaso broke something in my ear. The gypsy's baby? What did you do with him? Where is he? He's downstairs sleeping. This guy's a fucking wacko. Take it easy, okay? Calm down. He's our only way out of here. And we're still in time to stop something terrible from happening. I know you hate me. But I stole him and hid him myself to protect him from Damaso. The baby had better be okay. Go on. I said move it! And don't turn around. Don't look at me, weirdo! Ana, give me your hand. We're not going the right way. How do you know? You... That way? We're going that way? Are you fucking nuts? The exit is the other way. No, we're close. It's down there. Then we'll go out the other side. How? I don't remember any back doors in the plans. There's a cave under the mansion with an exit to the outside. - I'm not going in a cave. - Me neither. It's less than a mile long and it opens out into a clearing. It's the best short cut. If you want, we can turn around and cross the mansion. - We have no choice. - You believe him? - What choice do we have? - Let's go. - Follow him. - Move it. Come on! Wait here. They ordered me to keep him here. I know it's wrong and his mother's probably looking for him. I don't know anything about babies. But I did the best I could. You have to take him with you. Crazy son of a bitch! - We're following this guy? - You know the way out? - Calm down! - Shut up! You don't, do you? We have no choice. Yes, we do. Let him help us. Okay, we have no choice. Okay, we'll take him. But you show us the way out. Come on, let's go. Thank you. Thank you all. Santiago, do you know why they locked us up? They don't tell me, but I can imagine. Is it related to them stealing the baby? - I don't want to scare you. - Enough nonsense. It's because these two bozos tried to rob them. You're getting on my nerves. I told you, there's no way they could know. - Of course not. - Quiet! We're entering the cave. For your own good, remain completely silent. Trust me, you don't want to wake up what sleeps in here. Thanks for suggesting this route. It's the fastest and safest, except for total boneheads! Typical troublemakers. You never follow instructions. Give me the flashlight, I'll lead. - Give it to him. - Take the fucking flashlight. Take the baby. Careful. What bullshit. Come on! Here. Your baby. Give me the flashlight. Come on. Quick, run! Luisa! Luisa! Jump! Come on, come on! Hurry! That way... Come on, Eduardo! I think it's gone. Eduardo! Help! The gun. Please, help me! - Eduardo! - Ana! Ana, no! Come on! Calm down. - What was that? - I don't know, I swear. - What the fuck was that? - They never tell me anything. What? You're the one who warned us. Seriously, they never tell me anything. But sometimes Damaso feeds it. - What does he feed it? - Let me go. Ana. Listen to me! We need you here, okay? Come on. We have to go, the batteries won't last. Come on, let's go. Come on. Careful. Come on. Luisa, where's your flashlight? - I don't have it. - What do you mean? I don't know where it is. - You left it behind? - I don't know, okay? What is this? What's she doing? Where are you going? Ana! Ana! Ana! Move. There's a way out. Sir! They're here! Come on, let's go. That's enough bait! Come on, move it. Come on! Quickly! Move it. Quickly! Max, what the fuck is this? Everything in due time. Please. Cooperate and nothing will happen to you. Santiago, please. Good dog, good dog. Maximilian. I know you think we were stealing from you, but we weren't. You were wrong all along. What are you talking about? The money. We know about the 661 million you were hording. Who else is aware of that figure? Nobody. Pablo and I, nobody else. Not even Luisa, or anyone else in the department. Of course not. By the way, where is Eduardo? He's dead. He was killed by that monster you keep in there! Ana... I see. I'm sorry to hear that. I had other plans for him. Son of a bitch... We need you alive, but not necessarily uninjured. I'll tell you something to spare you the trouble of having to wonder. You were very close. You almost figured right. But it's not about money. Trust me, numbers are important. We all have one. They still don't have the amount they need. It's not 661 million. It's not an amount of money. What kind of joke is this? What do you want from us? We haven't done anything! It's a very bizarre joke. The kind that aren't funny at all. They're looking for people. The three of us, with Pablo and Eduardo, add up to 666. - I don't get it. - Those medallions. Cthulhu! It can't be. It's an ancient cult that required a certain number of human sacrifices to realize a series of arcane invocations. But it's impossible. Are you all crazy or what? Your explanation is just about the most simplistic I've ever heard. We're not going to invoke anything. On the contrary. And now, let us proceed. There isn't time. Lazaro Valdemar tried it over a century ago, and failed. You'll only make, the same mistake. I intend to correct a mistake, not make one. Now enough chit-chat. Max. You'll never get away with this. You can't cover up 666 disappearances. That won't matter after tonight. What is he saying? - Where are you taking us? - What? Where are you taking us? You son of a bitch... Nora? Nora! What the fuck is going on? Nora! What the hell is all this? Sommelier. Chamberlain. Everything in order? Yes, they've found the incubus in the abyss. It was unconscious. They managed to chain it up without incident. They're bringing it now. Even better. The scariest thing of all ended up being - the easiest. - I have one question. Weren't there four? One died in the cave. If necessary we can use a volunteer from the Order. No, we cannot. Bringing in outsiders is already a mistake. They mustn't be mixed. I've had enough from you, Chamberlain. You've disrupted this ritual from the start with your presumptuous attempt to take my place in the Order. When this is all over, I'll think of what to do with you. Prepare the trays. It's time to begin. Now. As you command. Tarantulas from Innsmouth. Eat them quickly, without fear. The blood of the spiders... - Nora! . will put your senses to sleep. - It will protect you. - Nora! Bring it, please. It must be done quickly. He's starting to doubt. Nora! Eat them. No mind can bear gazing upon our lords without first going insane. Listen to us. That man may have his revenge... and that we may be rewarded by your resurrection. Lazaro, you'll have to stand on the seal. Finally, after all these years, we'll finish this once and for all. A long time ago those words were spoken to me by a man just as obsessed as you are. What makes tonight different is I have nothing to lose. On the contrary. It's not that you have nothing to lose, but that you have so much to gain. Turn around. Ana, it's okay. Calm down. You'll be fine. No one must interfere in the sacrifice. It can't be... This is our demand. Return the demon to the flames of Hell. What happens next exactly? Are things going okay? The ritual to control the demon has successfully begun, but time mustn't be wasted. We offer you the last souls as an offering. Let their blood be the river that joins us. Sacrificing the baby isn't essential, it's only a link. It facilitates protocol between worlds. It's like a cover letter to the Great Old Ones. To show our lords we worship and respect them. Now it must be killed. Quickly and without hesitation. Then the last four victims are offered, reaching the number 666. Finally the Devil will fall, and the Great Old Ones will rise for a new kingdom. Run! Stop! Nobody move! Chamberlain, what's happening? Carelessness always precedes calamity. The Great Old Ones must never be mocked. Come on, come on! Sir... This way. Nobody move! We beg mercy of you. As men we worship you. We beg you to enslave us! Sir, this must be stopped. The ritual must be performed again. We no longer need an infant. The obelisk has been completed. Those required by the ritual have been killed by the devil. Now is the time to make the request. But please, quickly. There's no time to lose. In my right as a signatory, I wish to make my request. I ask you to stop the invocation just performed, along with the curse on my family. My love! Leonor? Leonor, what's wrong? Sommelier, what's happening to us? Sir, there's something you must understand. Your decline was not due to witchcraft, but to the very nature of time. Without the curse, you both return to your rightful age. Wait a moment. The agreement. There might be time for one last request. Sir, the Necronomicon will soon be destroyed. But as long as it remains active, there's still hope. There's time for one last prayer. Do it. No. All I want is to stop the aging. Leonor, my love. I'll find a way to stop the process. No. I don't want our family name, stained in blood any longer. Their souls... The Great Old Ones don't want them. Free them. Please. How do you know? I've spent the last 100 years in Purgatory. I never stopped hearing their cries of sorrow and grief. Yes, but... There's still time for another request. - Just one, my love. - No. Let two old people die, and the innocent souls, find their rest. In my right as a signatory, I wish to make, my last request. I ask for, the release, of the souls, that have been sacrificed, for this, ritual. Well, well, well. Little Red Riding Hood wants to fight the Big Bad Wolf. I should have killed you a long time ago. You've caused nothing but trouble, and tonight's little slip up... Congratulations. You got your way. Oh, you've got a weapon. Great. I've got one too. But mine is better! What now, you moron? That's what you are, a fucking moron! That's why you'll always be alone. Wait till you see the present I got you. Where do you want it? Here? Here? Carve him up into little pieces! I might be crazy. You've called me that before. But you know what? I think I've found a cure for it! Santiago. Santiago. - Can we help you? - They're dead. A bunch of people are dead. Shit, he's bleeding again. Santiago. We'll get you to a hospital, okay? Give us your exact location. Sir? Are you all right? Wait till you see the present I got you. We're almost there. Hang on a little longer. We need a doctor. Over. Sir, they've found the wounded. - They're out of danger. - So what's the bad news? It's worse than bad. I've never seen anything like it. There was a massacre in the ruins. I couldn't even write the report. Walter's counting the bodies. Prieto couldn't take it. I had to send him home. Call for back up. If it's as bad as I think, I don't even want to think about what we might find under that trap door. It's Santiago. We're here in Montenegro where something shocking has just occurred. The place is full of ambulances, police, bodies and reporters. - You can't be here. - Something amazing has happened. How is he? He held on just to make sure you were all right. We're doing what we can, but he's lost a lot of blood. Let me through! - Ma'am, you can't be here. - That's my son! My baby! I'm sorry, he just passed away. I'm here, baby. It's me, Mommy. I'm here with you. Santiago, sweetie. It's Mommy. You'll never be alone again. It's impossible. The ECG is unplugged. Good morning. I hope you're feeling better. I know it's inconsiderate of me to ask you for a statement in your condition, but in extreme situations, if we wait too long people forget things, that can be relevant. What were they doing here exactly? We're not sure. There was a lot of confusion. Please, do it later. They need more treatment and rest. Of course. By the way, the vultures just got here. No talking to the press until you talk to me first. I'll be back with something to eat. He's one of them. He wants to see if you know anything. How do you know? They're nervous because they'd never got this far. They're worried that outsiders may have survived. It's of vital importance that you stick together. Be smart and play dumb. Play dumb! - Ma'am, wait... - Well. Victory in the face of horror. I only came to make sure you're all right. I imagine you're frightened and have a thousand questions. You're the man who came... To the office? Yes. And many other places. It was my job, to observe you without interfering. To avoid distractions. To lead us to slaughter. Involving you in all this was a serious mistake. I tried to persuade Maximilian not to, but he wouldn't listen, as usual. His death has ended a cycle. Now another shall begin. But it must be a clean break, from the errors of the past. You understand, don't you? And with a new guide. A sommelier. I have a proposition to make. Join us. Join the Order. It hasn't been easy, but you would be welcome. Are you joking? Does it look like I am? I think we all understand the situation, don't we? Considering how much you know, I'm doing you a favor. Believe me, the alternative would be much more, unpleasant. It's funny. It looks like we're going to have to live in permanent uncertainty. What do you mean? We're not the only survivors of, the horror. Someone else, was compiling data, taking notes about the foundation, to gain influence and embezzle money. He planned to offer his findings as a tribute to enter the Order. No. The fat guy never offered us anything. He was trying to blackmail us. I don't mean Pablo Orquicia. Eduardo. Eduardo kept it all. Names, dates... Orquicia only found out about a small part. He tried to make a buck. We know where it all is. And we'll make it public if something happens to one of us. Nice try. You don't expect me to believe that. - It's a lousy bluff. - What is? The transfers to buy silence? Birth certificates belonging to 650 people? Erasing public archives? Should I go on? Being held captive brings out the honesty in people. But if you want proof... Here's some of the stuff he showed us. He thought he'd get a chance to talk to Maximilian. You can keep those. There are boxes full of them. Why not go straight to the police? Because we want to live free of the threat of revenge. If you're smart and leave us alone, 'well play dumb. But if you do anything stupid, we'll get smart. Be careful. When you bite off more than you can chew, you might end up choking. We're waiting for the witnesses. What happened? Will you make a statement? How many people died? What happened exactly? bSubtitle Rip; TheHeLL/b
