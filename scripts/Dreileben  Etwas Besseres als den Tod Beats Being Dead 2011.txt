Hello, Johannes. Dad, we got to go. Take care, Johannes. She only got back yesterday. She's totally jetlagged. You're studying! Good. Good. Take care, Johannes. Regards to Ute. To station 16. It goes with the terrain. Come on. Sorry... Would you like to get up? I... - I'll take that for you. Okay, good. Water temperature all right? You'll get your stuff back. I'm just having them cleaned. Sorry, I... I'm sorry... You'll be fine. It's my fault. All my fault. You'll be fine. This way. Flexible planning or what? Hello there. I've got two. - Two. Who's got cash? - I do. - Fine. That the lot? 5.30, please. Need a hand? Shit! Need a hand? - No! No? Good. So... - I'll make a fire. Got any paper? Just put it down... Let it really go off! Don't you want to sing? - Sing? Get on with it. Sing! As it's your birthday, we all really thought... That's the way. - We'd sing you a pretty song... just like we ought! Thank you, thank you. Your name? - Mine? You like that? That's good... Ladies and Gentlemen, this is my present from dearest Ana. Are you nuts or what? Let's go. What shit! Kiss my arse! Kiss my arse! Ana? Who are you? I live in the nurse hostel over there. I passed by and saw you. How do you know my name? I saw you at the petrol station today. I didn't see you. You were outside. Ana? I'll be right back. What happened? - No idea. Come on, hurry up. What's up? - Someone ran away. So what? - Molesch ran away. Move it! Someone has run away. Is he dangerous? No idea. Seems that way. I've got to go over there. - I've got work, too. Where do you work? - At the hotel. What's the time? - Almost 7.30. I still have a moment. Stay here if you like. Thanks. Will I see you this evening? At eight? Where? I'll collect you... Johannes. Can you give me a little money? Till this evening. For a taxi. I'm a bit afraid. Will that be enough? - Yes. I've got to go. Lock it behind you, put the keys under the mat. For the last time, don't try to delegate your responsibilities. That's not the issue. - How wrong you are! If the door was open, you should have noticed. I only wanted to know who might have opened the door. You're the police officer here. I'm a doctor. My patients need me. Good luck. I was at the concealed door... Why are you here? - The homeless lady escaped... Were you in the dead room? Okay, Johannes, go home. It's my shift. - Cancelled. Take two days off. Go to Hof. Ute will worry when she hears about this. Gee! Sorry. I borrowed one of your T-shirts. Do you want to be a doctor? - I'm studying... for an exam. If I pass it, I'll get a grant to go to L.A. Universities recognise this as an internship. Los Angeles. You've not studied lately. What makes you say that? My job. It's all covered with dust. Is your English good? Perfect. Pretty good. Will you teach it to me? Yes. - Agreed? I've got work now. I'll accompany you. Don't you have work? - I'm off. I wouldn't rob you. Never. I'm sorry. Shit. Ana? Mama wants money. Has she woken up? Why doesn't she come herself? Why don't you come yourself? Why aren't you at school. - I'm ill. You look healthy. What does an iPhone cost? Lots. I'm studying. So-so. Yes. He sends his regards. Don't worry now. They're searching thoroughly. They'd have caught him if he were nearby. Mama, I... I'll call you later. No, I'll call. See you. Excuse me. My mother gave me the money. I don't know why I... Why I checked, I... What kind of uniform is that? I'm a room maid. "Room maid". Where? - At the Aurora. You don't have a TV. No. Do you watch on your computer? No. There's one in the tea room. I watch it there at times. - Do all of you drink tea? "All"? They do at the hotel. Nonstop. The room maids? The guests. They drink it like a bunch of idiots. Thanks. What did he do? The escapee? He killed a girl. I saw him once in the hospital. In the dead room. There's that picture in the dead room, too. A ferry comes, collects the dead. Styx and all that. That'll be why it's there. Shall we listen to music? Put it on random. Random. Don't peek. Oh, no. No! - Leave it. No. - Leave it. Can you translate it? - It sounds corny in translation. You'll be disappointed. - Please. You cried all night. Cry me a river. - Do it properly Cry me a... - Properly! I cried... - Please. It's tons better in English. - Please. They're ugly. - No they are not. They are. It's my shitty job. The nails all break. For once I'd like... - They're the world's most beautiful. You like that? You watched. It wasn't real. Johannes... Forget it, please. Forget it. Please... please. Ana... Ana... Pretty stubborn. You too. Shit. I'm late. I'll accompany you. - Really? No one did that before. - You only get picked up. Say, did you... Ana! Are you still not finished? Come down to 544. They're in the lobby already! Johannes! I quit! And what now? What will you live from? Ana! Let's go to the lake. We'll get stuff at the gas station and have a picnic. It's only that... You misunderstood me. I only meant... jobs are hard to find in the area, and... Are you the Job Centre? Arsehole! Ana! Johannes! What are you playing at? Arsehole! Excuse me, Ana. I'm sorry. I'm always apologising to you. What did you call me? Fool. Cocksucker. Complete arsehole. That's the sea. No one's swimming. It's too cold. But they're all in summer clothes. The Pacific is too cold. The Pacific Ocean. Have you been there? With my class. With your class? In L.A.? What a school! Not everyone went. But you did. Those two are kissing. The faces aren't clear. The right to privacy. You're already dressed. I've got to work. Should I call in. "Johannes is not well at all. An upset stomach. He's vomiting and has a terrible headache." It's not school. It's a clinic. They'd send me to the doc. What about going late? A couple of minutes. Quarter of an hour. Come on. Please... I'm late already. Shit. Show me... You! Oh yes! I have to apologise. What for? It was dumb of me. What, then? Course you've got to work. And study, too. And I'll help you with it. If we continually sleep together, you won't pass your exam, and we'll never get to L.A. Since when do you smoke? - It's only when I'm thinking. So we sleep together, then you study. Then we sleep together again. Then you study again, et cetera, et cetera. First we sleep together, then I study? Yes. - Not the other way round? No. There's one problem left. - What? Your English. When will we study it? You'll need it in L.A. We can sleep with each other in English. How does that go? That's pretty good. Could be better. Well, then... Let's go study. "Umbilicus". In English? - Umbilicus. "Crista". In English? - Inguinal. "Skrotum". In English? - Scrotum. Really? That's too simple. Mamma. No! Yes! - In English? That's okay. "Labium majus". Do you need money? No.What for? You wanted to pick up your stuff. Oh yeah. You love me after all. Sure. We're having a party on Saturday. At the club. You're invited. I called Ute, but she's in Hof. But you will come? You've got to! Bring your acquaintance along. Gladly. - Wonderful. It starts at 9 p.m. Nothing formal. It's meant to be fun. See you then. Who's that? - The head doctor. You know each other well. And Ute? She's my mother. He knows her well, too. And what's she doing in Hof? She works there. - What's her job? Why do you want to know? Why not? I just want to know everything. There's nothing special to know. Hey. It's all special. I look forward to the party. We... - We are definitely not going. That is, I'm not. Why ever not? - Their stupid parties, stupid music and stupic club... The gold club! - Yes. Come on! We have to go. It's embarrassing. What's embarrassing? Their lordly posing. It makes me puke. Am I embarrassing? - What makes you think that? Then let's go. We'll dress up nice and have fun. - No. Do I embarrass you? No. - Johannes! Do I embarrass you? No! - I do! Ana! Ana? Don't come in. No! I've done something stupid. Wait! I nicked your mother's money. What? - The money from the book. I didn't really nick it. I took it. What for? I had to buy something. What, then? You don't like it. You don't like it. Do the balls sink? Are they expensive? - Yes. Shall we go back up? How many balls do you think are in there after a season? Two or three thousand. How do you know that? I took them out. In my autumn vacations. I let out the water. Fished them out. Here? I washed them, packed them in bags, and sold them as "lake balls". I had a little stall over there. I looked like a farmer selling eggs. Packs of ten. Three euros the bag. Did you earn a lot? Two thousand balls. Ten a pack, three euros each. You can work it out. What did you do with the money? I gave it to my mother. Why? Because we needed it. I'll get you another. Ana? Johannes asked me to bring you a Bellini. Philipp. - Thanks. Do you know Johannes from the clinic? Horrible, right? What can the poor guy play, though? Everyone wants to dance. Mama, papa, the uncle. So it's "Ipanema", then "Guantanamera", then "I will survive". And some old girl takes off her shoes and dances barefoot. Cheers! I knew it. They don't dare. Sara was conceived to "Sad-eyed Lady of the Lowlands", not to Fleetwood Mac. You're right. We should go in. It's her birthday. What kind of cream is that? Providone-iodine. How did she get in here? I was wondering about that. It must have been Papa... - I suppose so. Will I have a scar? A small one. How small? Very small. A mark of vulnerability. Right. I go to Berlin on Thursday. I've got a university place. I know. Your father said so. He fixed it for me. What with my shit grades... You know? You could have studied anywhere. Why Los Angeles? Because of you. I wanted to have a career. Then come back and impress you. And make you love me again. Tell me more. What? How you'd come back. Dressed in white, at the wheel of a white Porsche. We meet as if by chance. I pretend to have forgotten your name. I rack my brains. Try to... - Hannes! I was stupid! Ana? I'll get you a dressing gown. Johannes. You can pack your things tomorrow. I'll give you a sick-note, and you leave the clinic. Sara told me everything: You're leaving for Berlin together! Come here! Johannes! I think it's great. Wonderful, my boy! So. Enjoy your last day. Ana? I'm sorry. I don't know. I saw you dancing with her. I got so worked up. I... I'm so sorry, Johannes. Really. I'll make up for it all. Forgive me. I know you can't now. But maybe soon. What's that? If you leave me, then, then... - Will it always be this way? What? If you don't like something, you'll grab a knife? "Something". I can't do it. I tried. But it hurts so bad. I'll make up for it all. For what? That with the blonde. I screwed up. You'd have gone with her either way. You hurt her. Sara will have a scar. Sara! A scar! So what? You're crazy. Wait. I'll bring you to school. In twenty minutes. You were asleep. Where are we? There was a jam. I had to leave the motorway. Should I drive? Do you want to? - Yes. I still have all the CDs you made for me. All of them. I'm happy. Johannes? Johannes? Johannes!
