Your tears Glisten, laced with pain The crescent moon Hangs in the past Pale with sickness Cool night, too long Turns to frost Who is on the tower Frozen in despair? The rain drums lightly On a crimson pane My destiny is written on paper Fluttering in the wind Distant dreams Rise like incense Melting into night ls your image Chrysanthemums fall Weeping to the ground Traces of your smile On a yellowing scroll Your heart now empty My thoughts quietly rest The north wind blows Not yet dawn Your shadow clear and close Only companion of my soul On the lake, a couple mirrored Blossoms of evening air Beauty undimmed Scatter everywhere A fate hard to swallow Sadness, do not cross the river Your autumn heart will sink Drowning in longing You will not reach the other shore Whose hills and rivers Echo with the clamor of hooves? My armor is shredded By the dividing hour The sky slowly brightens Your sighs, silk soft Weave a night of sorrow So fragile, so spare Chrysanthemums fall Weeping to the ground Traces of your smile On a yellowing scroll Your heart now empty My thoughts quietly rest The north wind blows Almost dawn Your shadow, clear and close Only companion of my soul On the lake, a couple reflected Chrysanthemums sigh ln the cool night air Traces of your smile ln yellowing despair Your heart now empty My thoughts quietly rest The north wind blows Almost dawn Your shadow, so close The only companion of my soul On the lake, the two of us
