Joseph, where did you get those clothes? Her name's Isabel. They saw her. I've come to save her. Joseph, did you rob someone? I had some luck. Maybe God, you know? God gave me this.

He killed people in Afghanistan. That's what soldiers do. It doesn't mean he's a thief. Did he say where he got the money from? He said, "Maybe God." Anyway, what do you think the police themselves would do with it if you handed it in? They'd just share it out and drink it in the pub. Add it to the nourishment fund, or at Christmas, get them all jumpers or something. Actually, he told me to buy something for myself. I thought perhaps maybe I could use just a small proportion of it. You see, there is something I have been praying for. You're a good and holy woman, Sister Cristina. If the money's an answer to a prayer, how can it be wrong? Let me put it this way. I've not written anything down about this in the book. ( CALCULATOR KEYS CLICKING ) One for Maria Zielinska.

Okay, it's not a mistake. Who wants pizza? - ( SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ) - ( BABY CRYING ) JOEY: Tell your boss in fifteen minutes to have Mr. Choy's envelope ready. Also, I wanna order takeaway for delivery. It's very nice, but I've no idea what it is. I think it's probably duck. And there's fish and chicken and pancakes. - And this is from Crazy Joe the angel, yeah? - Next? ( GIRL SCREAMING ) ( DOORS OPEN, SLAM ) Just drive, man. Just fucking drive. ( TIRES SCREECH ) ( GIRL SCREAMING ) That's his little sister. She won't talk. ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) Dawn? It's me. Joe. Nice suit. Me and your daughter live on 25 a week. Since I lost my job, I've been paying the landlord with blowjobs. Everything's cut. What have you been doing while they cut everything, JOEY? I've been fighting. There's more where this came from. Lots more. ( DOOR OPENS, SIGNAL BEEPS ) ( SIGHS ) - ( SIREN WAILING ) - ( BELL RINGING ) JOEY: You got my invitation. Wasn't sure you'd come. Buying food for the boys, it's okay, but not this. Giving me things puts me in a very difficult position. You're not vegetarian, are ya? Why are you lighting fires on the pavement? My Chinese boss sends his people here to buy meat for his restaurants. I get three hours hanging out on the street doing nothing. So tonight I decided to have a barbecue. - ( CORK POPS ) - You used to feed me. Tonight, I feed you. This is a very strange thing to be doing. I miss the smell of woodsmoke. I'm guessing that you have psychological problems. They put me up a mountain and told me to kill people. What'd they think would come back down the mountain? Joseph, I came here because I might have some news... about Isabel. They found a girl. Last night, my police liaison officer gave me this photograph. She was found in the river. They need help with identification. ( SPATULA SCRAPES ) ( SIGHS ) She was from the north, that's all I know. Did you love her? We shared a box. We'd just keep each other warm. Will you talk to the police? Fuck the police. Joseph, I'm really sorry to bring such awful news. Where in the river? The city, near to Canary Wharf. One of those rich guys. Yes, they think she was killed by a client. - The police give a shit? - Of course they do. David is a good man. Really? He's a "good man." Good, good. Good for him. - Good. - ( KNIFE SCRAPING ) - ( YELLS ) - In the fucking river! If you dare to be angry about Isabel... you're a hypocrite. I've asked around about your job for the Chinese boss. They say, "Crazy JOEY deals drugs." I just deliver the stuff. I don't touch the stuff. The autopsy said Isabel "touched the stuff." Maybe stuff you delivered. You don't put those things together in your head. You know why she ended up in the river? Because that's what the river's for. To wash away girls when they're finished with them. I see what's happening in this fucking city. How many people you feed these days, huh? You give them soup. They want their lives back! JOEY, when you were out of your head on drugs a few months ago, you gave me some money. I've spent it on something for myself. I haven't been able to sleep properly since. I... I called my sister in Warsaw. She sold some of the possessions I left behind. I don't need this. I'm really sorry about Isabel. I know you cared for her, but think about all the other Isabels. Start to do the right thing. It is honest money. I cleaned it for you. Use it to start an honest life. I want you to have this. I'm gonna do a lot of good things this summer. Give people what they want. I thought you might want a dress. JOEY, I'm a nun. I used to wear a uniform. Don't mean a thing, you just take it off. If it looks beautiful on you, then God would say it's okay, wouldn't He? I will put it in the bag of clothes for Africa. WOMAN ON TV: My guest this week is Baroness Glennis Baker, a emeritus professor of psychology.

( GROANS ) You're only alive because I need information. An eye for an eye. You tell me what happened to her, or I'll kill you with this spoon. Some guy used to rent her regular. Beat her up. He used to ask for her. He went too far. Name. We don't use names. Describe him to me. - Ah! - Describe him to me. He was about 30, city boy, scar over his eye. That's all I know. You get any trouble from these two again, you tell Crazy Joe, okay? ( CHILDREN CHATTERING ) ( SWITCH CLICKS ) Jesus. ( MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY ) Fuck. You look... Your note said you had information for the police about Isabel's killer. That is the only reason I am here. And I put on this dress because it is the only dress I have. And don't think I won't send it to Africa, because I will. They think my name's DAMON, by the way. Please don't remind me. - I think I might faint. - What? I haven't eaten anything all day... worrying whether or not I would come. Also, I didn't realize there would be so many naked men. ( GASPS ) Look, I arranged to meet you here because I thought you might like the photographs. I didn't realize there'd be photographs of men's... penises. Sorry. JOEY, actually, I do like photographs. I take photographs... usually of nature. Penises are nature, I suppose. Yes, I suppose they are. So what'd you tell the mother? I lied, I lied, I lied. So what information do you have? Tell your policeman to look for a guy around 30. He has a scar above his eye. Works in the city. Should I write this down? That's all I have. Okay... 30 years old, scar above his eye, works in the city. Got it. We haven't been introduced. I'm Karl. What's your name? Just looking around. I'm told the invitation you handed in at the desk was addressed to DAMON Coldfield. I happen to be DAMON's photographic agent. He's in New York. Who the hell are you? ( SPEAKING POLISH ) I think you're a bit drunk. Yes. I'm having a crazy patch. Starting when I bought the ticket. What ticket? I used your money to buy a ticket to a ballet. That's a pretty wicked thing to do. ( CHUCKLES ) But, you see... I've loved her since I was a little girl. Loved who? Maria Zielinska. She's 42 and still dancing. She is who I always wanted to be. She is who I should have been. ( SPEAKING POLISH ) ( SHATTERS ) I'm in a silk dress in an alleyway... with a gangster. - Whoa! - Oop! And I'm drunk. Are you still a gangster, JOEY, or did I change you? Just having a crazy patch, too. There are things that I have to do. When the summer's over, I'll stop. Because of me, yes? I have to think I'm doing good. Your excuse for wearing a pretty dress. When does DAMON return? October the first. ( SCOFFS ) Then it's fate. What is? When I say it's fate... I should really say it's God, but I don't. You know why? Because I'm not so sure that God is there anymore. That's the truth. ( SPEAKING POLISH ) I think I'm going to throw up. Oh. No, I'm fine. Sister, I'm Catholic. I'm not your sister. I'm drunk and I'm up against the wall. 30... a scar above the eye... works in the city. WOMAN: A massive 50% off. Rain jackets half price. Fleece half price, T-shirts half price. Walking shoes half price. - A massive 50% off. - ( CAR ALARM CHIRPS ) JOEY... H- how are things? Things are okay. Have you heard from DAMON? Yeah, he's okay. You seem so together now. I'm really together now. You're like a different person. So, JOEY... are you exclusively gay? You know, it's interesting... recently... I've found myself attracted to... nuns. ( CAR ENGINE STARTS ) ( MEN SPEAKING ITALIAN ) Who the fuck are you? You owe Mr. Choy money. What the fuck do you know about Mr. Choy? JOEY: He's my boss. What are you talking about? Mr. Choy only employ Chinese. Tell Mr. Choy I'll send him a check. ( JOEY SCOFFS ) I'm taking the cash. ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) Give me the fucking cash. ( WOMAN SPEAKS ITALIAN ) Step out of the way, my friend, and let me take some of what you owe in cash as a gesture of goodwill. No! ( YELLS ) ( YELLING IN ITALIAN ) WOMAN: Please don't hurt him!

WOMAN ON RADIO:...known by the name of JOEY Jones. No known address. Approach with caution. Reported connection to the Angel of the Lord Homeless Mission, Covent Garden. Is there a problem? You are scaring my clients. We're looking for someone. Calls himself JOEY Jones. ( HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING ) We've been told he used to come down here. They said you'd know where to find him. ( CHURCH BELL RINGING ) Let me help ya. What are you doing here? I just lied to the police. You haven't changed at all. If I could do something else, I would do it. What did the policeman say when you gave him the description? He laughed at me. He said it was "too vague." He said, "Tell JOEY Jones to come and speak to us himself." You mean they can't be bothered to fucking look 'cause she was a whore. The truth is... the police are more interested in finding out more about you. You're becoming famous, JOEY. And Isabel isn't famous? You really are a hypocrite. You beat Taxman so bad he's still in hospital. You're not just an angel, you're God Almighty dispensing justice. Yeah, well, I believe in justice. Sometimes you have to make it happen yourself. I'm not the only hypocrite here. Want a kiss? ( DOOR OPENS ) - Sorry. - Get out of my car. It's a van. I suppose you think it was very funny that I got drunk. I've been drunk myself on occasion. What exactly happened? You don't remember? It's all a blur. You asked me to kiss you, so I kissed you. ( SIGHS ) You didn't have to kiss me just because I asked. I wanted to. Why did you want to? That's a really stupid question. Look in the mirror. It's not my fault that I'm fucked up. For a nun, your language is pretty bad. So whose fault is it? He was my gymnastics instructor. It was in Warsaw. It was my father who made me do gymnastics. I wanted to be a ballerina, but he said no. ( DOOR OPENS ) CRISTINA: If I had become a ballerina, it wouldn't have happened. My instructor began to... ( SHUDDERS ) He began to do it when I was 10 years old. He did it 17 times. It was going to be the 18th time. For a very long time, I believed I belonged in hell. Because I was so young... they decided not to send me to prison. Instead, they sent me to a convent. JOEY, I... I have never told this to anyone before. Want me to drive? I want someone to drive. ( DOOR SIGNAL BEEPS ) CRISTINA: Here will be fine. ( ENGINE STOPS ) How will you get home? I'm a gangster. I'll steal a car. I'll walk. It's a lovely morning. ( SIGHS ) Cristina, in the end, I just took off my uniform and ran. And look what happened to you. Sister Cristina, I am deeply shocked. You filled in the Africa application. My preference is for the Valley Mission in Sierra Leone. But what about your work here at the Soho Mission? Africa was always part of my life plan. Yes, in two years. I want permission to move it forward. But why? I am finding there are too many distractions here in London. You're blushing. It's very warm in here. It's even warmer in Sierra Leone. Hot, even. I will wear a hat. You have applied to leave in this quarter. I am ready to leave any time after October the first. ( CAR SIREN PASSES ) JOEY, they said you wanted to speak to the boss. Come with me. ( SPEAKING CHINESE ) Sit. Madame Choy. Madame, you know everything that happens in your back garden. ( SPEAKING CHINESE ) If a man pays for girls and he's violent, he soon becomes famous. ( SPEAKING CHINESE ) We refuse to deal with them. The Russians will just charge double. I understand you have a blacklist of violent men. JOEY: I'm looking for a very violent man who attacks girls. He's young. Around 30. And he has a scar above his eye. He wears very expensive suits. We know him. The description is not too vague for you? We have a business to protect. Madame, would you be able to find out the name of this man? Hmm. ( DRAWER OPENS ) ( SPEAKS CHINESE ) A favor for a favor.

You could afford to get a professional to do this. Yeah, but I wanted you. So who are the photographs for? My daughter. You have a daughter? Nine years old. I came here with her once when she was small. She might remember. I want her to have some photographs of me looking like a normal man. What do you think? Like this? ( IAUGHS ) Smile. Why? Okay, actually, you look okay. Do I look like a good man? What do you mean? I want her to think I'm a good man. Yes, you look like a good man. So take a picture. ( SHUTTER CLICKS ) Did your daughter ask for photos? No, but when she's older, I want her to have something to remind her of me. You won't see her? I don't think I'll look like this for much longer. Why not? Why shouldn't you stay like this? Just take a picture. ( DOG WHINING ) You should have one like this. More natural. The businessman drinking his morning coffee. Such a successful man. So rich. - Charitable. - Of course. She will be very proud of you. Enough. I said enough. At last a laugh. There. I am changing you. Send those ones to me. I'll take them with me to Africa.

But we have also had successes. And we have also had some who, in spite of how it may appear, give us reason to hope. ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Who are you? I've got something for your mother.

JOEY'S VOICE: "Dear Cristina, I just wanted to say thank you for taking the photographs. Considering it's me in the pictures, they turned out pretty well. I gave all the best ones to my daughter, so you're left with the ugly ones and the scary ones. Sorry. I've sent DAMON the money I took from his account and added some extra for rent. I left the boys at the mission some cash for pizzas. And I sent details of the people smugglers to the police. I also rid the city of a bad man. I know that doesn't make me a good man, but I tried to do the right thing. Now I'll go back to the street and disappear. I was alive again for one summer. I'm glad I spent it with you. I hope Africa treats you well. All my love, Joseph Smith." ( SIRENS WAILING ) WOMAN ON RADIO: Visual confirmed. Surveillance camera profile matched to Joseph Smith. MAN ON RADIO: Target in sight.
