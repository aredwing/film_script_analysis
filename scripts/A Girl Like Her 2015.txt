Do you have your seatbelt on? Yes, I do. Your rearview mirrors OK? Mm-hmm. Oh, my gosh. I get so scared when you're driving. - Why? - I don't know. Let's see how well this turn... oh, no. - OK, OK, don't judge me, don't judge me. - Oh, my gosh. This is exactly why I get so scared. Where are your books? I forgot them. Oh. How are you going to study for that test tomorrow? There's a test tomorrow? Yeah. All right, we need to make a signature out. Just say, "I'm Jess" and "Peace!" or something. I'm outtie. Wait, wait, wait. - You're embarrassing me. - What about... what about just, like, a... That was good. You know, it's not every day that you get to come to a school anywhere in America and see this type of excitement that doesn't surround sports. The National Commission for High School Education does not hand this honor out easily. Number Ten in the entire nation, and they are more than proud here because, whether or not they knew an award was at stake or not, they did the right things. We cannot go any further without interviewing the man of the hour. We're talking about the principal of this school, and you're gonna hear a lot of cheering 'cause these students love this guy. Principal Richard Harris. Principal... Congratulations to you. Thank you. Thank you very much. The eyes of the nation... not on North Brookdale, but on South Brookdale. Yes! Yeah, Brookdale! What is it about this school that sets it apart? I know the students are special, but what about the way things are done here? It's a community. It's the parents getting involved with the students, getting involved with the teachers, everybody doing it. It's a community effort and then the kids doing it themselves. Without their hard work, without them saying, "We want to do this," this couldn't happen. That's the only way I can say it; it's everybody doing what they should do, and this is it! We're the best! Do you know an average person laughs about 15 times a day? Really? That was, like, a courtesy laugh. - I felt bad. - Ha ha! What are you doing? Um, come here. I went to a little spy camera store... and I found this little guy. That's not a camera. It is a camera, and I know how much you like dragonflies, so I talked to the guy and... just fancied it up a little bit. - But... - I don't... - We'll clip it here. - Are you messing with me? I'm dead serious. It records. It's recording right now. Wait. Yeah, it's recording. Look. That is actually a camera. Well, where's the... where's the lens? That's a secret. I can't tell you. But just know that it's wireless and I will turn it on and make sure it's all working. I've rigged it like a pin, and we can put it on you. We can put it on during school and record everything, and it'll just look like, you know, a necklace or just like you're wearing a pin, and nobody will ever know what it is. Jess, are you in here? Jessica? Sweetheart! Wake up! Jessica! Jessica! No. No, no, no, no, no! What... what did you do?! Sweetie, what did you do?! What did you do?! 16-year-old female. Overdosed on hydrocodone, 750 milligrams. OK. Uh-huh. Yeah. - Her vitals are very low. - OK. - 80 over 40. - OK. She's been unconscious for two hours. OK, get her in. All right, hook up a monitor. Do an EKG. Get a CBC, blood gases, liver enzymes, prepare for intubation. Get a social worker in here, stat! 96.3, WDVD, Blaine and Allison. Another cloudy day, 7:45. So did you hear this? In light of all the hoopla surrounding South Brookdale's tenth ranking in the nation, which, by the way, totally amazing, if you ask me. I know. It's pretty awesome! An award-winning filmmaker has decided to include the school in her important documentary that examines the best American high schools, and South Brookdale is the only public school featured. Let's hear it for South Brookdale! The students of South Brookdale are about to have their 15 minutes. Principal Harris. - Yes. - What an exciting time for South Brookdale. Well, we are the first public school ever to make the top 100... and not only 100, we're Number Ten in the country. It was a complete surprise. Go, Maples, baby! Go, Maples! Number One! Everyone's so excited, and now we have pep rallies coming up for it. It's kind of cool 'cause, you know, all of us are together to celebrate one big thing. Good morning, ladies. How are ya? - Good. - Good. We're excited that you have, uh, you've come to see our little corner of the world. Getting ready, ladies? Everybody good? It's a good day. - Is she in a hospital? - I don't know. I didn't even know anything. I heard about it in the halls. There's rumors going everywhere. I literally just... just talked to her the other day. I keep thinking about the classes I've had with her since I've gotten here. Nothing happens around here and, like, this happens? Like, it doesn't make any sense, you know? Like, you see it on TV shows, but when it's actually happening, like, at your school, someone you have a class with? Yeah. Yeah. You OK? I just feel so bad. I wasn't really the best of friends with her, but I did know her and she was in my classes. I saw her in my classes and stuff, but... that was about it. She's really kind-hearted. Really nice girl. Kind of shy. Jessica was probably one of the sweetest girls I ever knew. I think she was probably one of those people that got ran over and pushed to the side. There's been something a little more reserved with her lately. I did. I did and I didn't. Wasn't a drastic change in her behavior. Uh, there was just a... um... a little less enthusiasm for school. Most of the time, she said she was fine, but sometimes she just said, uh, she sort of brushed it off by saying, "Oh, I just have a lot on my mind." Kind of the typical teenage answer, but, as a teacher, I should know better. This was something a lot deeper and darker for her. I heard from a few people that there was a few girls who were giving her a hard time. Mainly I just heard it was, like, bullying over time and, you know, uh, from... someone in the classroom. I heard that she was getting harassed a lot by some girl that goes to our school. Yeah, her name's Avery. I don't really know Avery, but I've kind of heard of her and stay out of her way. I mean, she doesn't seem mean, but when she's around Jessica, she just sort of... I guess she just sort of changes. I've met Avery, and she doesn't seem like that type of person who would do that, but, I mean, I guess... rumor has it. You just hear all the rumors. You don't hear anything about, like, what actually happened, you just hear the gossip. I thought we were gonna go get coffee. What time were you gonna get coffee? Yeah, we can, but I want to go shopping before Dan's party, so... Hello, ladies. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. Can we talk to you for a couple seconds? - Sure. - Great. Are you... are you Avery Keller? Yeah. Nice to meet you. I'm... I'm Amy. Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Hi. We have been talking to students throughout the day about... - about Jessica Burns. - Mm-hmm. Did you guys hear about Jessica? - Yeah. - It's, like, all over school. Did you know Jessica? We used to be friends, but... You were all friends before? No, I used to be good friends with her, but... Oh, you... not anymore? No, just, like, high school. You know, you grow up. But nothing happened between the two of you? - No. - Oh, just kinda - grew apart? - Yeah. Jessica was admitted on Friday. She was unresponsive from an overdose of hydrocodone. She has, uh, slipped into a coma due to lack of oxygen to the brain. It's called hypoxia. At this point, it is a waiting game. We are going to, uh, run a number of neurological tests on her. Is she... is she in any pain? No, not at all, but she is there, so you being here, talking to her, holding her hand... - She can hear us? - Yes. And that all helps. That will help bring her out. How... how long could this last? We can't tell you at this point. We're not sure of the damage that has occurred. How are you guys holding up? She... she hasn't left the room yet. I'm not gonna leave the room, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. From here on out, though, what's most important is that you guys take care of yourself so that you can better take care of Jessica when she comes out of this state. Do you have any other children? Uh, yeah. I took our youngest girl, Gabby, to school today. The best you can do is to try to keep a normal routine. OK. I don't... I'm sorry. Excuse me. Her whole life, I've been taking care of her. In her car seats and making sure she's... I should have known, though, I know. She's my kid. I should've known what was going on with her. I didn't have a clue. I'm right here, baby. Mama's gonna stay here with you till you wake up. And you're gonna wake up. Mommy's right here, and you're gonna be just fine. I love you. You know, Jess, I normally hate romantic comedies, but that one was actually pretty decent. - I love rom-coms. - "Rom-coms"? - That's what you call it? - Mm-hmm. - You're such a nerd. - I watch them so much that I - have my own name for them. - Oh, my gosh. That's sad. I...in real life, I don't think a girl like that would go for him. I thought they were cute together. I don't know. You got to just blow it off. You can talk to me. I'm done talking about it. There's nothing... there's nothing else to talk about. Can you please turn it off? Yeah. Suicide... successful suicide... is permanent. Suicide is not temporary. You will not come back to see your father, your mother, your brothers, your sisters, your relatives, your friends... no one. It's a tragedy for the whole school, for the whole community because this is a... um, just a wonderful young lady who, uh, had a bright future, uh, ahead of her. She was pretty much a loner, except for Brian. In a school of this size, you could have multiple friends, right? Brian? Hi, Brian. I wanted to talk to you a little bit about Jessica. OK. Can you tell me a little bit about your friendship with her? I have heard that you're really good friends. Yeah. Um... Jess has, like, been my only friend since... seventh grade, I guess. Do you know how she's doing? I, uh, I... I don't feel comfortable talking about her like this. I understand. I'm sorry, Brian. That's OK. Guys, turn off the cameras. Turn 'em off. I'm sorry, Brian. Any updates about Jessica? No, she's, uh... she's no worse. How's Gabrielle doing? I don't know. I mean, she seems OK, you know? Kids seem to... take it in stride somehow. I'd love to have some answers, you know? This doesn't make any sense to me. Little girls don't just start taking drugs and don't take a whole handful. Hey, honey. Are you getting hungry? - Yes. - Yeah? How's your homework going? I didn't do my homework yet. Oh, sweetheart, you've got to get that done. How about after dinner, I'll help you with your homework, all right? OK. OK. Dad, can I tell you something? Sure, sweetheart. What is it? It's OK, kitten. Come here. Don't be scared. OK? 'Cause... Listen, listen. She's gonna be OK... all right? She is, and we're gonna get her home. OK, kiddo? We'll get her home soon, OK? And we'll all do something fun together. OK. But you can't worry about this thing, OK? I miss her, too, sweetheart. Why don't you go wash up for dinner, OK? Hey, do you guys want to sign this get-well card for Jessica? Tell me a little bit about South Brookdale's social scene. Um, our school's, like, very cliquey. Everyone's very organized. Everyone's got their own group. It's, like, average high school. There are the people that like band or the people that like theater or the people that like basketball, the jocks. Yeah. Hey, do you guys want to sign this for Jessica? Yeah. It kind of depends what grade you're in, but, like, mainly Avery and her friends. All right. Thank you. It's just those type of people that think they're, like, better than everyone and, like, no one else really matters but them and, like, everyone else is just kind of, like, worthless, you know? Hey, uh, do you guys want to sign this get-well card for Jessica? Uh, no, it's OK. Uh, are you sure? Mm-hmm. OK. - Thanks! - You're welcome. You sure you don't want to sign it? No, it's OK, thanks. - Seriously? - Mm-hmm. - OK. - OK. I just thought it would be nice. Is she serious? Ha ha! Oh, my God. Jess! Hey, Brian. What's up, Jason? Hey, sorry I didn't wait for you. I just... - Is everything OK? - I just want to go home. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Jess. What happened today? Nothing. Did she come up to you today? I don't want to talk about it. Jess, are you sure you're OK? I'm fine. Hi, ladies. How are you? - Hi. - Hi. Good to see you again. Avery, can I talk to you for just a second? - Uh, yeah. - Do you have a minute? - Hold on. - OK. Gonna close this. - Will you wait for me? - OK. OK. - How are you? - Good. We've talked to a lot of kids in the school, and your name comes up a lot. You're very popular in this school. Most of the people we talked to at this school think you're really sweet. But there has been some talk, though, from students at the school that your relationship with Jessica is a little... it's not as positive as maybe you've told me about. Uh... I... like I told you, we were friends and... it's just that now we're not, in high school. I don't know; we've both gotten older and made different friends. It's not anything personal, it's just... we both... just went different ways. Yeah, that's understandable. Mm-hmm. There is some testimony about when you get around Jessica, things kind of change. I don't... think that anything ever changes when I'm around Jessica. I behave the same with her as I would anybody in the halls. Maybe if you knew what it's like now in high school, like, girl world now, with being popular and everything, it just is a lot different. People don't really know what it's like to be me and I don't mean that, like... rudely or, like, thinking a lot of myself, but it's just people don't understand what it's like to be popular. I'm just like any other girl in high school. I think that perspective is kind of important. Would you be willing to be a part of this story that we're telling about the American high school? And would you be willing to be the face of that stereotype of the popular girl that not a lot of people understand what it feels like, the pressures of feeling... - Yeah. - that popularity and living up to that popularity? But I want to caution you that what you put out there, the world is gonna see. The real you. Like, the... I don't know, like, - the popular-girl perspective? - Absolutely. OK. ...work this thing? Holy crap. - How do you... - Is it by the red button? Yeah. OK. OK, so today is Day One of Avery's life. Her documentary? I don't know. - This is my girls! - Hi! Is everybody... wait. How do you... I don't know. It's backwards, so... - OK. Hello, ladies! - Hi! These are my main bitches right over here. Ha ha! Hey! What did you guys do this weekend? What did we do? - Partied, of course. - Partied. And made out... hooked up with this guy. Emily. - Oh, my gosh. - Ex... - Seriously? - What the... Oh, look! Wait! Hold on! It's Brian! Brian! Brian! Wait, wait, wait! Hold on! - Hold on! Brian, wait, wait. - Hey, Brian! Hello! Hi. How are you? - Hey, Bri! - Hey, Brian! - Hi Brian! - Freak. - Oh, God. - Bye! Brian, just say hi. Just wave, really quick. - Freak! - Wave really quick! Hi! - Bye! - OK. That didn't really work out. As you can tell, I have losers for friends. - Hey! - So... ha! - That is not fair. - Love you, too! So, Day... ha! Day One kinda... kinda sucked. So we'll try again tomorrow if we feel like it. I don't know. OK! OK. Think it's on. OK, so... my name is Avery Keller, and this is my first... video... journal thing, so... yeah, I don't really know what to talk about. I...am a normal teenage girl. I have my 4 best friends... Maddy, Tessa, Kayla, and Emily... and they're... super fun. All right, so my girls and I want to show you what it's like to be the sophomores... the popular sophomores... of South Brookdale, so let's take a look. South Brookdale pride! Ha ha! - Hey, Trevor! - Hey, Avery. - Hey. - Hi. - Who was that? - I don't know. I pretty much just hang out with them at school. It's not like a clique or anything. It's just... I don't know, it's just who I hang out with. - Hi. - Hi. Have you ever talked to any of them? - No. - Hey. - Is that her locker? - Oh. Jessica's locker. So, anyways... - Hey, girls! - Hi. - Like your shirt. - Thank you. - Don't like yours. No! - Ha ha! You know, I think that people, like, take it that I'm being a bitch because I only hang out with my friends, but... I don't know; I just don't have any interest in making any more friends, so... it's not, like, anything personal. I hate my hair today. It looks cute. I don't have enough time. Here, you do it. Yeah, I don't... I want to do my eyeliner really quick. So, yeah, this is our girl time because we never have enough time because we're always running late. So we use this bathroom as our "getting ready" bathroom, and nobody comes in. And that bitch blocks the door. Yeah, Maddy! Hi, dolls. So usually no one comes in because they kind of know... - Right. What the... - that this is our place... Excuse me. Get the... out. That is why she blocks the door. This is high school. Nothing... nothing different from any other high school you'd go to. People joke around, and people mess around and have fun. It's just how high school is now. I don't really do any school activities. I used to, uh, I used to dance. I have my trophy for dance, and my mom would love it if I did dance still because she's annoying and she loves to control my life and she would've liked if I did Pom this year, but I didn't... didn't want to do that. Nose in the books, guys. Nose in the books. I got you for another 20 minutes. Twenty minutes. Oh, my God. This class is so boring. I literally hate public school, and this is why. Because we don't learn anything. Do you see this? And she is texting me. I actually like school. I do. I get good grades because I cannot wait to get out of this place. I just want to go away to college. I cannot wait to be out of my house. But... I don't know. Other than that, I'm just your normal teenage girl, living out the high school dream. OK. It's getting late, honey. Listen, why don't you go home and stay with Gabby and I'll stay here tonight, OK? Hmm? I'm OK. I'm staying. Are you sure? Yeah. OK. Good night, Jessie-bell. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's OK, honey. - I... - It's OK. - No. It's not OK. It's not OK if I... - If I would've known that the... - What? I didn't know those pills were there. I didn't even know that they were there. - Honey... - How did she find them? It's not your fault, all right? You listen to me. Listen to me. - I saw those pills... - The pills were there. I saw them in the cabinet. I didn't throw them away, either, OK? Do you think it's my fault? Are you sure? - No. - OK. Then it couldn't be your fault, OK? We'll find out what happened, OK? But this is not something you did. You're a good mom, OK? It's not gonna stop, you know? It's... it's not like it's just at school. It's on my phone, it's online. It just consumes my life, and I just... I can't concentrate on anything else, no matter how hard I try. No matter where I go, no matter what I do, she always... she just... She just always... finds a way to get at me. There are some allegations that Jessica was being harassed. "Bullied," actually, are the words a lot of your students were using. I don't have any... knowledge of that right now. That's just... um, at this point, I'd put that in a rumor. Kids tease each other and call each other names and are mean to each other all of the time. Do you guys have a zero bullying policy in place here? Yes. Ha! We do. - You smile about that? - I do, because I think it's, uh, it's rhetoric. There's no forum for any one of us to say to anyone, "Hey, "I think this is happening with my kid in my classes." They're not going to investigate. None of the administration really wants to talk about it. You try to stop something happening one day, but the next day, you don't know if it's gonna escalate or you don't know what happens in the other classrooms, and you don't know what happens when you do take it that next level; if it gets resolved or if it just is, like, brushed aside and hushed over. And if they do get punished, then there's more bullying. - Yeah. - For... for the person telling. One time, a few people saw it and they sorta... talked to Avery, but no one really took it any further and it... it didn't really stop. I've never seen it happen, but if I did, I don't... think I would've done anything about it. They just don't want that status of being, you know, a tattle tale, a snitch. Someone goes to a teacher or a counselor, and someone else will start to make fun of them by saying how they're weak or they're a baby. A teacher might like to put it as if we were all zebras, and we're watching our fellow zebras being eaten by a lion, and that's kind of what it feels like. We're just watching people get attacked, and we do nothing. I just don't understand why. I mean, they're popular, they have all the nice clothes, they have friends. They, like, get things they want. Their parents, like, love them to death, stuff like that. They have everything. Hey, guys! Welcome to the Keller compound! - Thank you. Good to see you. - We are so excited - to have you here. - Thank you. Come on into our kitchen. I wanted to invite you by saying come on down. You are the next contestants on "The Cooking is Right," and I am your host, Kassie Keller. Right in here, I've got... a roast beef, and right there is a marvelous macaroni recipe that came from my Grandma Marge. - You have a beautiful kitchen. - Thank you very much. My husband paid a lot of money for it, uh, when he had a job. And up here, I've got what I call Kassie's Casserole, which is actually just chicken Parmesan with some broccoli. For Avery, she's trying to lose weight, and so she always wants to eat a lot of vegetables. Right here, we've got cucumbers and tomatoes and a meteor shower of herbs and spices to jazz it up. I think she's still reeling over the time when she didn't make it for Poms, and she came home that night and said, "Oh, it's... you know what it is? It's because I'm too fat." Um, I attribute her not making that team to the psycho coach that she had, who was, um, giving her a lot of attitude about the way that she treated other kids on the team and chose not to select her this year for the Poms team. This is Josh. This is our son. - Hi, Josh. - Hi. How are you? - Good. - He recently graduated from high school by the skin of his teeth. - Thanks. - Yeah, yeah. - Excuse me. - Just joking around. So Josh lives here at home with us, and his favorite thing to do is play video games. I think one day he might actually become a video game designer; I think that's his big aspiration, but right now, college is not interesting to him. - Maybe we stop with that, so... - It's all right. You know, it's... it's your one minute of fame. You might as well suck it up. You had your chance! You could've been on camera with your mom! - Yeah. - You missed it, buddy! OK. Avery! Avery, can you get down here, please?! You know, you guys might consider not eating before Avery gets down here. That's really obnoxious. Avery! - Chop chop! - I'm coming. Get this show on the road. I made sure you got a lot of vegetables, a lot of protein because I know that you said you're worried about your weight. Thank you for sharing that. - You're welcome. - So polite of you. - You're welcome. - Oh, my God. - Why are we doing this? - Can I eat now? May I? - May I eat now? - Sure. Go for it. So why don't you tell us how your day was today? It was superb. Just great. Well, what kinds of things make your day superb? I don't know. Did you get any tests back? No. What about you, Josh? What'd you do today? Um... not much. Uh... beat "Call of Duty," so... I hear that's a pretty popular game with your age group and the 13-year-olds in America. Ahem. So, Avery, any boys that you're interested in? Not that it's any of your business, but no. - Better not. - Hmm. Well, why don't you tell us... if you don't want to talk about that kind of stuff, why don't you tell us why your friends are here today, filming our family as we sit here and dine on this excellent cuisine? I don't know, Mom, because they like me? I don't know, OK? Do you think it's because you are a beautiful, talented, intelligent young lady, and that might be the reason why you were selected for this prestigious opportunity? Kassie, leave her alone, will you? Aren't you proud of our daughter? Don't you think that this is a great opportunity for her... - Just stop, just stop. - to really shine? Cut the bullshit. Just stop. Just stop. Let's just eat. - Let's just eat. - Let's have dinner. We're just having fun here. Can't we have fun once in a while? Yeah. Just give her a break. Let's... let's have our dinner. That's what we're here for. Well, maybe when you learn how to lighten up, we can do that. We can have dinner and have fun at the same time. OK. Seriously, please just stop. Hmm. All right. Well, I think it's pretty exciting that they're here, and I'm glad that we can be involved in this film about you. I'm very proud of you. Very proud of you. Mm-hmm. I'll tell you what... Where are you going? Game's on. You know where I'll be. I just wanted a peaceful dinner with our family, and that's what I get. I think I've lost my appetite. Food's good, Mom. Yeah, it's good. Thank you. Raise your hand if you have a best friend. Now raise your hand individually and tell me what makes that person a best friend to you. Yes? They love me, no matter what. They love you, no matter what. Yes? They never ask me to change. They never ask you to change. Anyone else? Yes? They're always there for me. Always there for you. Phenomenal, but the question I ask all of you is, why didn't you say the grades that person had? Sports they played? Cars they drove? Money that they did and didn't have? Anybody? Because that's irrelevant. It's not important? Doesn't matter? Then why do we believe so much that it does matter? The big question is, where do some of you go to be safe? Do you feel safe in school? Some of you? - No. - Truthfully. - No. - Why? 'Cause you can't be yourself there. You can't be yourself there. - Yes? - Uh, I don't think Jessica Burns felt safe here. Tell me why. Um, maybe she didn't have that person, that best friend to make her feel safe or make her feel comfortable and accepted. So if you could change the outcome, then what could you have done? Because that... that sometimes is where it all falls back. What could we all do? Be there for her? It's OK. I have something... that I want to show you guys. Hey. Hi, Brian. How are you? - Good. Come inside. - Good to see you. I have, uh, everything set up upstairs, so... and I should've showed somebody a while ago, but... I didn't. I like your room, Brian. It's pretty cool. Thanks. That's me and Jess. You know, Jess and Avery used to be friends and everything... - Mm-hmm. - you know, since they were kids. Really young, and... sometime last year, it just... something changed. They were in class. Avery was trying to cheat off of Jess... Jess's test, and she, like, moved her arm. - Jess did? - Yeah, and she, like, moved her arm to try to block it, but I don't even think she did it on purpose, and Avery just went nuts. So that was the starting point? Um, yeah, pretty much. It started slow, you know? It would be, like, a bump here and there in the hallways, like, nasty text messages or dirty looks. It just... escalated and blew up. You know, Jess didn't feel very safe. I bought her this backpack, hoping that she would use it. It's called an iSafe backpack. You can pull an alarm. But she, um... she wouldn't use it. I told Jessica that I wanted to document it, you know, like, I started filming everything. I have my own camera and, um, I gave Jess this little tiny camera. It was like a hidden spy camera, you know? We would record every day for 6 months. Six months? Six months. We got everything. I've rigged it like a pin, any ordinary safety pin, and we can put it on you. We can put it on during school and record everything, and it'll just look like, you know, a necklace or just like you're wearing a pin. And nobody will ever know what it is. So... what are we using this for, exactly? Like, at school with, you know, Avery and stuff. Like, filming them. I think that's a bad idea. I think it's a great idea. I don't. - What if she finds out? - She's not gonna find out. You didn't even think that this was a camera. Well, what if it beeps or something? There's no noises. I've already thought this through. Trust me. I think it's too risky. It's not risky. Can you imagine what she would do if she found out? She's not gonna find out. - No one will ever believe... - We don't know. - that this is a camera. - You don't know that. Jess, would I ever do anything... to... I'm not saying you would intentionally do something, but... We won't talk about it in school. We'll just keep it here. You don't have to make any decisions, but just take it home... and if you want to work with it, then just put it on in the morning. And I'm gonna be filming with my camera, too, so it's not just gonna be you. OK? I promise you I won't let anything bad happen. OK, but... we can't show this to anyone. Nobody. I made a promise to Jessica that I wouldn't show anybody. And, um... well, I'm breaking that promise right now, but... She didn't want you to show anybody? She said it would've made it worse, but I tried to tell her that if you show somebody, we can find her help. Bitch. And I am at a stop sign. Who texted you? Avery. Jess, don't let that bother you, OK? OK. Watch it, Jessica. Move along, Jessica. Keep going. Keep going. Go to class. Go to class. Ha ha ha! Nice outfit! Where do you think you're going? Why didn't you reply to my texts? I thought we were friends. Why didn't you text me back? I was so nice to you! You have to get to class, really? You have to get to class? Oh, you have to get to class? She has to get to class. I don't give a... if you have to get to class. - Move. - Ha ha ha! Later, freaks! You're a disrespectful little... Did you know that? What are you guys doing? Oh, just... opening your locker for you. Just admiring all your cute decorations. Are you 5? Who decorates their locker like this, - like, really? - Avery, stop. This is depressing... oh, wait. You and Brian. - He's so precious. - So cute! You guys would make an adorable couple. Was any of this manipulated at all? And I don't mean any offense by this question. What do you mean by manipulated? There was nothing set up at all? - No. - Or Jessica didn't change at all, knowing that she was filming? I mean, she got nervous. Did Avery see you recording any of this? Um... Or this was all her little button cam? It was all her button cam when she was with Avery. Wait, just say hi to the camera for me. - What? - Say hi. - Say, "Hi, I'm Jessica." - Hi, I'm Jessica... You missed a shot! You missed it! Oh, no! Oh... How's my little bitch doing? Good? Go home and crawl under a rock. You don't belong here, OK? Hey, Jess. Go on. Aww! Ha ha! I'm really sorry. I am so sorry. I'm sorry. It's fine. I'm... I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to. - Yeah, right. - Ha ha! Seriously, Jessica, if you disappeared, the world would be a better place. You're a... bitch. Did you really just ...push me? No. I was pushed. Are you... kidding me? You weren't pushed. You just pushed me. You know, that was a dumb move, Jessica. I am just gonna have to beat your ass now. Why don't you just go kill yourself? I have this funny, funny feeling that she thinks that everything is just gonna get better from here on out. Just end it. Oh. Heh! Well, well, well, it's Jessica Burns. What are you doing in my bathroom? Nothing to say? No? Well, your bathroom, it's down there with the rest of the little bitches. Do you get that? Are you understanding me? You have nothing to say? She's not a fighter, is she? She just stands there. - Do you understand me? - Ha ha! You're gonna be back in your little bathroom that you love so much. Get that? Don't move. You think that I'm just gonna forget about you, and I'm gonna get bored of you? That's not the case because I... hate you. Ha ha ha! Oh, wow. - Aww. - You have no clothes. Aww, what are you gonna do? - That is so sad. - That is so sad. You make my life so miserable just by being here, and I'm gonna make your life miserable, too. Guys, do you smell anything? Kind of embarrassing. I think we should take care of it. Come on, we're gonna give you a little... a nice, warm shower. Hold your nose! Ha ha ha! Have a really nice shower. So I think I need to kick your... ass. I think it's about that time. Are you OK with that? Got it? - Ha ha! - Go to class, Jessica! You're gonna be late! Jess? Jess, are you OK? I can't. I can't, I can't. I can't do it. - Jess, what's wrong? Come here. - I can't do it anymore. What's wrong? I just can't put up with it. I can't... I can't put up with it anymore. I'm done. I can't. I can't do it. Jess, I'm so sorry. I just... I just don't know how much more of this I can take. That's why we have to show 'em, Jess. We have all this footage. We have to do something. No, it's embarrassing. I'm not showing this to anyone. It'll get better, I promise. Just... It's not gonna get better, it's gonna get worse. It's never gonna end. It's never gonna end. - Jess... - It's never gonna get better. I just feel like I have no way out. I can't. I can't. I can't do it. - Hey, guys. - Hi. - Getting anything done in here? - Yeah. Yes. I am working so hard. - Heh! - I really am. - OK, OK. Bri... - OK, wait. Just say hi to the camera for a second. - OK. - Yes, say hi! - This is gonna be great footage! - OK. Millions of people will see this. OK, this is the greatest mom in the world. - Aww. - Mwah! OK. Hey, let me take a picture of you guys. I want... enough with the camera. We want the laundry put away, and then it's dinner time. Twenty minutes. You, too, Brian. Get to studying. Sweetie, 20 minutes. OK. I love you so, so much. Bullying's been going on for... as long as there have been people, there's been bullying. What it is, is we've got to see that it... it's changed, it's getting worse, but why is it changing? Why is it getting worse? A couple of years ago, we had kind of the same situation that didn't go to this degree, thank God. Would you people please mind telling me what you've done in the last two years to change that? These things can't happen overnight. It does take time and it takes money, and there's a lot of different things we have to be... that have to get approved before we can put anything into... into action, and there are other issues besides this going on. Well, what is it gonna take? I mean, a girl is in the hospital. No one knows what's gonna happen with her. So is that gonna be, like, the awakening? And what if it was your own children who tried to take their own life? I care about my daughter! And I care about how she feels when she comes home. And she tells me she sees it in the classroom, she sees the bullying in the parking lot, she sees it out on the playing field. And I want to know, what are you guys doing? What are you doing when you see the bullying? What policies does the school have in place to take care of this? We believe the issue is about engagement. Not... not engagement with this commission or the school, but engagement with parents and their community, with their kids. We believe that's the real issue. The parents that are here today aren't the parents of the children who are probably the bulliers. Most of the time, the parents that show up here are the parents of the kids that are doing well. But I... I think that we also can't lose sight of the fact that the mental health of these bullying kids has to be recognized, too. We'll never stop the bullying until we find some method of reaching the bulliers and getting inside of their heads and finding some way to bring some healing to them. You know, I've... I've learned over the course of my life that hurt people are the ones who hurt people, and these bulliers are hurting. Look at you, watching TV with your frickin' clicker, lying there on your ass and not contributing anything to this household. - Four times... - OK, so, uh, this is a typical night in the Keller household. ...wash your hands because men don't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom. Well, when I go down there and go to the bathroom, I like to wash my hands after I take a piss. - Jesus Christ. - I'm gonna fix... I'm on it, I'm on it. Jesus... While we're onto what we're on, are you on to getting a job this week, or is that gonna go another two months? Yeah, uh, I got an appointment, uh, with my friend Jerry on, uh, Wednesday... What the hell are you doing? Are you... kidding me? What the hell are you doing? What, are you taping them? What are you doing? Yes, I'm... taping them. Stop asking me questions. Get out of my... business, Josh. Why don't you get out of this family's business? Is this... are you... is this a joke? What are you... You better delete that, whatever it is. Oh, my God! Go back to playing video games. You... loser! Yeah. You're such a bitch. Oh, I'm a bitch? I'm a bitch? Is that the most creative thing you could've come up with, Josh? Why don't you try going back to school? - You grow up. - Go back to school. Grow up, really? You're how old and you dropped out of college, still living at home? Yeah. "Grow up." ...grow 'em, I don't know what else I can do... Yeah, not only do my parents fight, my brother's a... douchebag, so... so, yeah, that's my night. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Hello. - Um... - Tell her. Go ahead. Tell me what? Um, there's a... kind of, like, a rumor going around. Um, a bunch of people are saying that you're the one to blame for Jessica's suicide. OK, wait. Who said this? It's... it's a huge rumor and it's everywhere. The girl next to me in my math class said it, too. Why is everyone stressing out so much about it? - It's obviously not true. - Because people are saying that the harassment, all this, like, how much she's being messed with, this is what caused her to do what she did. That's what they're saying. And I'm not blaming you. I'm not saying it was you... Yeah, you're obviously saying it's me. I'm not saying it's you. I'm just trying... Yeah, obviously you're saying that this is the whole reason why she did what she did! I'm saying that's what other people are saying. Yeah, you just said that that's the reason why she did what she did to herself. We're just saying that if enough people are talking about it, they're gonna start asking questions. OK, you all stand right next to me whenever we talk to Jessica. Is it harassment? Is it... harassment? No, so why don't we just drop it? - Just drop it. - No! It's not! Thank you. It's not harassment. Oh, really? You're really trying to... ...this! Thank you. Thank you guys so much for starting all this bullshit! She's trying to help me, really? You're starting all this drama. Now people are looking at us. Thank you. I didn't even do anything. Are you serious right now? She's not taking this seriously enough. We're not gonna get in trouble. Nobody's gonna get in trouble. Yeah, but people are gonna start asking questions pretty soon. You're supposed to be her girl, to be there for her. I am trying to be there for her, but, what, throw myself under the bus in the process? Yeah, I'm not about to get in trouble for stuff that she did. Well, I think you just need to keep your mouths shut because we have these cameras walking around. Hi. Brian, hi. They made her a sign at school. Oh... that's so sweet. How's she doing? She's... doing about the same. How are you doing? Not so good. I know. This all feels like this weird dream. I know. Um, I have to tell you something. So you know about all the bullying that went on at the school? About, uh... 6 months ago, I told her that we should start documenting everything, like, with cameras and stuff. It's been going on for 6 months? Yeah. Jessica... you guys should've told me. She was embarrassed about it. But you should've told me. Why didn't you tell me? Because she made me promise, and I couldn't break that promise. No. Sweetie, it's not... I know. I wanted to tell somebody. And you're a good friend. That's what... that's what you are. You are a good friend. - But I... - And you held her promise. You know how much we care about you. You know that, right? I would never, never want you to feel bad. Can I talk to her for a second? I'm so sorry, Jess. I had to show somebody. And everyone's trying to stay strong for you... because we know that you're gonna make it. I miss you so much. Let me ask her the questions and, uh, give her a chance to tell us her side of the story, I mean, because I think it's important. Um, been principal long enough to know there's always two sides to every story, um... Come in! Hi there. Come on in. Please, have a seat. OK. Um, your parents and I have been discussing this, uh... this letter. Well, I'll just let you read it. What is this? Well, it's pretty obvious what it is. Your friends have made a statement here that you're the cause of, uh, the bullying and, um, we're here to find out the complete story. Now I'm giving you a chance here with your parents here to tell us your side of this because I know there's always two sides to every story... I didn't do any of this stuff. I didn't do any of these things. I didn't... I... let's see, I did not harass her, I didn't send her multiple "mean things," I was not "mean to her" relentlessly. You didn't... you didn't do any of these things? No! I didn't do any of those things! I did not harass her or bully Jessica! O-OK, all right, if you say that, then why would your friends put this on... on paper, put their names to it? This is serious. This isn't just, "Oh, geez, she was not..." I'm not... I'm not joking around about this! Obviously I know it's serious, but I didn't do any of those things! This isn't something I can just pass off because you said, "I didn't do anything." You understand that? There are consequences for actions, and part of the consequences are you have to take responsibility for things that you do. Yeah, OK, OK, so... so maybe I joked around with Jessica. Maybe I joked around with her, just like those girls were. I was joking around with her. Maybe I took it a little bit too far, maybe it hurt her feelings; I don't know, but that's not my problem that this girl can't handle a joke. - Mr. Harris... - Everyone blew it way out of... Mom! Everyone blew it way out of... - Don't "Mom" me. - Mom! Everyone blew it way out of proportion that that's not even true. None of that is true. You know, he's bullying you right now, trying to get you to admit to something - that you didn't do! - Mom. I know. I'm not bullying. I am asking questions to find out answers. My daughter is being thrown under the bus by these girls over something that you know damn well happens everywhere in schools across America. OK, OK, we understand. I didn't do anything! Everyone understands I didn't do anything! Look, I don't understand that you didn't do anything. What I understand is that I have a very serious situation here that I have to take care of, and I want to know everybody's point of view, including yours, so that the proper actions can be taken. Did the bullying put her in the coma, or did she put herself in the coma by swallowing the pills? Yeah, that's a actual, logical point. Thank you, and I'm telling you that I didn't do anything, OK? - All right, all right. - I joked around with her! Seriously, this is such bullshit! No I'm seriously done with this! If that's what you want to hear, that I'm sorry for joking around with her, then I am very, very sorry for joking around with her. I am so terribly sorry that I didn't know that some girl doesn't know how to take a... joke! Sorry, a freaking joke! I didn't know that somebody can't take a joke! Seriously. Like, grow the hell up! Grow the hell up! Take a joke! I am so sorry! I'm sorry! I have to get to class 'cause I'm a very good student. Bullshit. ...I didn't do shit! Calls my parents in there and tries to embarrass me. It's, like, honestly! Does she really think anyone's gonna buy this? ...of actually getting to explain... And this is my way of actually... What's going on? Avery Keller's, like, gone nuts. ...or people telling me that I'm lying. This is the only way for me to actually put out there the way that I feel. Everybody here at school is blaming me for this stupid-ass Jessica Burns bullshit. I am so sick of everyone turning against me and blaming me for what happened. This girl did this to herself! I did not tell her to go do what she did! No one told her! She made that decision! For all those girls, and they know who they are, you've... with the wrong girl. God. That's so messed up. Avery? Avery. Avery, please, will you come talk to me? Are you doing OK? Yeah. Why? Do you want to talk to me about that video posting that I saw online today? Why? That's not really what we agreed to, and I'm very concerned. That was my own personal thing. Not your thing, that was my thing. I know that, but I want you to understand, it's a very damaging thing that you did, - to post that... - Damaging? - For yourself. - How is it damaging? Because it was reactionary. When we react to things, it's never our best selves. And you were angry. Yeah, I wanted everyone to see that I was angry. I wanted everyone to see that, 'cause now, when I walk around, people are scared to come up to me and talk to me about this anymore. That was what the whole purpose of this was. Is that who you want people to see? That's how I feel right now, though, so... "Right now." Absolutely perfect words. "Right now." It's going to pass. I'm here to tell your story, and I think it's a very important story. The most important story. What if I were to tell you that I know for certain that footage of you harassing Jessica exists? Have you seen it? I have. We'll come to your house and we'll watch it together, OK? Yeah. The footage is very real, and I want you to prepare yourself for that. In the meantime, will you please, please do yourself a favor and take that posting down? - Yeah. - OK. I know you got to get to class. - OK. - All right. - Hang in there, OK? - Yeah. All right. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm kind of embarrassed about how I handled the situation. I'm just so frustrated with not having any control, and I think that what I was trying to do is regain some of the control over the situation. Obviously, that didn't really work out so well, so... it just kind of sucks right now because I feel like everything's falling apart slowly. My friends turned on me. I have no one to talk to... I mean, besides you. I mean, kind of... I feel like now I can talk to you. I feel like now you... you're the only person that's really there for me, you're the only person that doesn't... judge me and... make me feel... like I have to be perfect. You make me feel like I can just be me and you're not gonna judge me and... I just feel like I can actually talk to you and, um... I'm not used to... to being able to talk to someone. I don't know what to do. I don't... I just feel so... I don't know what other word to use beside "lost," and I don't really know what to expect for tomorrow. Hopefully I can ho... like, pull myself together before then, but... we'll see. Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Keller, how are you? Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Hi. So you ready to get started? - Yeah. - OK. Set up a monitor here, if you guys want to take a seat. No, um, they're not gonna stay. What do you guys have going on here? Well, we're... we're sitting down to... We're just watching something, so you guys can just go. Well, I am not gonna let you just sit there by yourself. I have to watch it, too, with you. I mean, I'm curious what's going on here. No, it's fine. Trust me. I can do this by my... this is my thing right now with Amy, so... But I am your mother, and you are going to sit with me and allow me to be your support system. I'm not gonna sit with you. I'm gonna do this by myself because I'm a big girl and I need my privacy sometimes, so can you please go? Let's just give her a minute. This is about her. You don't have to be here right now... But she needs somebody to support her through this. - Uhh! I'm fine! - No, she doesn't. Yes, she does! We'll be in the next room, right? If you want to go to the next room, you go right ahead; I'm gonna stay with her. I'm not leaving her in this time of need! Listen, you're going with me in the other room to leave these two alone! This has been going on long enough! This is about Avery. This is not about you. Can you just listen to Dad for one time? Please, can you just go? - Is this gonna go on? - Fine. - Fine. - Let's go. Thank you. - You OK? - Yeah. How about we just... we get started? Yeah, let's watch it. Let's just... let's just... please, I just... I don't want to have to have her barging down the stairs right now and be annoying again, so let's just start. OK. I was once a star Shining bright You pulled me out of the sky Stole all my light Why? Why? Let's be friends. Let's be friends. I heard you got a boyfriend. I have to go to class. Go to class? OK. I was once a boat Where do you think you're going? Sailing off to sea She's not a fighter, is she? She just stands there. You dragged me back to the shore Changing my course in life Why me? I just don't know why she hates me so much. Why you got to pick on me? Do you understand me? You're gonna be back in your little... And I don't know where I'm going But when I get there, I can say That I have been the kindest me That I can be Maybe she doesn't hate you. Can you say the same? Maybe she hates herself. I don't think so. Code Blue! I need help here, please! What's going on? - What... what's happening? - Jessie? Nurse, please escort Mr. and Mrs. Burns out of here. - Jessie? - All right, we have no pulse. - I need Epinephrine, please! - Jessie! Mrs. Burns, you have to go now, please! - No! - Get the parents out! Mr. Burns, please take your wife out! You have to go, please! Let us do what we do! I need a cart in here immediately! Somebody get me a cart! Administering Epinephrine! But we need to help her right now! Please do something! Do something! Jessie! Get that camera out of here! Nurse! - Out! Out! Please! - What is going on? No response! Beginning compressions! Where's my cart? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I was once a tree Rising from the ground Winter, spring, summer or fall I still grew tall Till you cut me down And I don't think it's gonna stop. Are you really happy now? Clear! - And I don't know where - No pulse! I'm going But when I get there I can say - That I have been - Charging! - Clear! - The kindest me - That I can be - No pulse! - No pulse! - Can you say the same? Charging! - Charged. - Honey. - Clear! - Clear. - No pulse. - Oh, my God! Again. Charging. Yeah? Have you guys... Your children would be really disgusting. Can you turn it off? Charging! Clear! No pulse! Again! Oh! Jessie. Can you please turn it off right now? Now I'm a shooting star Please turn it off. - Can't catch me - Clear! Clear! - Tried to pull me - Pulse! We have a pulse! Out of the sky Steal all my light, but look - OK? - Yeah, yeah, she's OK. It's not dimming I can't... OK. It's not OK. It's all right. What do... what do I do? What do I... I don't know what to do anymore! I mean, she's not... Let's take... let's just take it one step at a time, OK? Let's just take it one step at a time and we'll get you some help, OK? All right? I mean, she's dying. I can't even... I can't even say I'm sorry! I can't even tell her I'm sorry. I know. I know there's no excuse for that. It's just not right. I hate myself now. I hate it. I hate it. I'm very proud of you. This is... this is really hard. I think you're a very, very powerful young woman who people love and people follow. But I know that's not you, and I know underneath that, there's someone who's just in a lot of pain, who needs to talk to somebody and get it out. Don't you just want to get it out? Yeah, but, I mean, who would I talk to? I have nobody. My mom doesn't talk to me. My dad doesn't talk. My friends don't care about real life. They care about shopping. They don't... I don't have any real friends. I did have one real friend, and that was Jessica. The one person that cared about me, the one person that would never hurt me, and then I go and fuck it all up. I...hurt her. And I can't even say I'm sorry. Let me see the charts. We have no... I'll know within 24 hours. OK. We need to discuss Jessica's situation. - Can we do it outside? - Absolutely. Please. Dr. Burns? After you. We just checked Jessica's blood levels, and it seems that her organs are not improving, so she is continuing down the path of organ failure, complete organ failure. We have her on hemodialysis at this point... and... after that, that's pretty much all we can do. What do we do then? What happens after that? I'm sorry. Mm-mmm. There's gotta be something left to do. We've done pretty much what we can. It's just basically up to her now. - I'm sorry, Dr. Burns. - Please. I'm sorry. I am... the one responsible for Jessica Burns killing herself. I wish that it was me... that couldn't wake up. I wish it was me that wasn't breathing, not you. You don't deserve that, but I do. I deserve all of that. Hey, guys. What's happening? Um... - Hey, Brian. - Oh, honey. I thought everything was OK. Well, she's had a rough night. They're saying it doesn't look good. People paid me attention because of what I was doing. And even though it wasn't positive attention, it was still attention to me. I didn't care. I didn't care that what I was doing was... affecting someone else so much that they felt like they had nowhere to go and had no one to go to, that they thought it'd be better just to... to die than to be here. She can hear you, you know? She can hear you. I tried to get control over other people, and now I'm just totally lost. I thought it was easier to put up a wall and be the one to control others. And it's not... it's not right. And I was lucky enough to have someone now care enough to... to show me that and to tell me that, and spend the time to talk with me and listen to me, which I've never had before. It wasn't me just playing games and joking around with someone. It was me... ruining somebody. Jessica... I know that you might not ever get to watch this, but if for some reason you do, I'm really sorry. My name is Avery Keller... and I'm a bully.
