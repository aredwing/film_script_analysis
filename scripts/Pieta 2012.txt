Can I borrow more money? $30,000 more. I'll gladly be a cripple. Why'd you borrow it? Cuz we're having a baby. He'll be born next month. I wanna give him everything. I feel bad. If he's born cuz of me, I should take responsibility. I'd do anything for the baby. I made money off this. But, now I'll make the sacrifice. I'm ready. I envy him. For what? How you think of him. Don't all parents feel the same? Your parents would've done the same. How much insurance money can I get for one hand? $30,000. That'll cover your debt to us. Then, $60,000 for both? Then, cut this one, too. Get $60,000 and give me $30,000. I wanna play it one last time. If I continued with music, I would've ended up worse. I don't need it. Take it. Aren't you doing it? What are you doing? I gotta be a cripple. I have to provide for my son. So, hurry up! Make me a cripple! INSURANCE CLAIM Play it for the baby. What'd you do before you met me? Got any family?

But ended up with nothing. The owners get new buildings coming in. What about tenants like us? What is money? I had no intention of paying back from the start. I got it to spend like crazy, then die. Ever looked down on Cheonggyecheon from the sky? This place is going to be gone. I came when I was 16, Soon, this place will be... filled with high-rises, too. Death complicates the claim! Death? What is death? Don't feel guilty cuz of me. HAPPYPRIVATE LOANS LEE SANG-GU $30,000 It made me feel sorry to you. What did you do to the man today? Jumped off a building by himself. He must be dead.

He probably didn't die. Or report it to the cops. I'm scared. That you'll suddenly vanish. I can't survive being alone again. Today's your birthday. Go buy a cake. Let's celebrate. So, this was my birthday present? It looks a little small for me. Why? It's not done yet? Boss, it's Lee Kang-do. Why you! You son of a bitch! I'm sorry, boss! I'm sorry, boss! You ungrateful bastard. Get lost! Someone else is doing it. Boss! Please give my mom back! You have a mother? That's why you quit? Scared of revenge? It's not me.

Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you I have a favor. Plant me a tree. Where's the sweater? I wanna wear it today. Can a pine tree live by the water? It'll live. Thanks.
