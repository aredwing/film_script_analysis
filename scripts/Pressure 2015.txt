Perhaps to sense its beauty and stare at the infinite horizon... that offers no questions, seeks no answers. Perhaps to stand in awe of its power, savagery, grace. This is all true, but there are also those who go to sea... ultimately because they are lost and never want to be found. ( DRAMATIC MUSIC FADES UP ) ( MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES ) ( ALARM BLARING ) ( ALARM CONTINUES ) ( MEN SHOUTING, INDISTINCT ) GUARD (OVER P.A.) Security, code orange. KARSEN (OVER P.A.) I need her ready to go! Do you want to be responsible for shutting down the entire pipeline? As soon as you get that chopper up, you call me, you understand? Why is the ship turned? We got a low-pressure read on the pipeline and manifold. It's more than likely an anchor dragged down from a passing barge, but we don't know. That doesn't answer my question. No, I thought not. Just bring me what I need. Right. We need to put a team in the water. Who do we have? Dive teams have already flown back. And there's... Harris. No, Harris is a fuck-up... take Hurst. It's gonna need a coated well, so that's you. A DC178 is right here. Just make sure that well holds tight. You know there's a storm in the way. Trust me, I've had another welder on this boat... we wouldn't be having this conversation. You're in charge, get it done. I'll make sure upstairs knows who to thank. All right. Oh, and give the kid some bell time. The kid? He hasn't gone below 30 meters. Putting a team down now. Go! Fuck off! Yeah, yeah, they're on their way. Hey, kid! You're about to get broken out. About time. Congratulations, get suited up! See you later on. Hurst. [HURST] Fuck off. Hurst. It's a little early for Bible class, ain't it, Mitch? Oh, I think it's a little late for that. You know, it's funny. I thought this was gonna be a strictly no-alcohol vessel. Yeah, I heard that, as well. But if you need something, you should let me know. I need to get a team in the water. My shift's over, mate, I'm done. Double pay. I'll start packing now. Don't be packing any of that, okay? [JONES] More money. Yeah, I'll be back-- well, I'll be back on Saturday, won't I? It's only an extra day, isn't it? We've been through this, haven't we? Just get whichever pram you want. I love you. LISA (ON PHONE) I love you, too. Take care. CARMEL (OVER PHONE) Hi, you've got the Mitchell residence... unfortunately we're a bit busy to take your call right now... but leave your message after the beep and we'll call you back. Have a beautiful day. ( BEEPS ) ( DISTANT THUNDER CRASHING ) KARSEN (OVER P.A.) Dive team A report to Sat Chamber 2 for lock-in. Well... This is gonna be a bundle of laughs, isn't it? See you at about midnight, Mike. MAN (OVER P.A.) Okay, Mitch, let's mix team ready... for atmospheric compression and diving depth. KARSEN (OVER P.A.) Ready for blowdown? Go for a seal. Blowing down. Got a seal. MAN (OVER P.A.) SAT Chamber 2, we have secure. Five meters a minute, blowdown commencing... increasing the pressure to 650 feet, seabed equivalence. You'll be at depth pressure in 60 minutes. Over. Look, kid, you might want to take the lid off. What? You might want to unscrew that. Fucking... bollocks! For fuck's sake, man. ( OMINOUS MUSIC FADES UP ) KARSEN (OVER P.A.) Going to go transfer to diving bell B, over. TECH (OVER P.A.) The diver recovery system is working properly. Stabilizing clump weight. KARSEN (OVER P.A.) Open downstream valve, check gas-to-diver and BIBS. Bell supply skin valve open. Reading 1-9-0 at the panel, 1-9-0 at the panel. Over. KARSEN (OVER P.A.) Check side door seal is clean and when you're happy, go for a seal. Diving bell B, ready for transfer to moon pool. TECH (OVER P.A.) Saturation complete. Have a good dive, lads. Over. Karsen, we're ready to leave surface. Blowing valve open. Depth gauge... 3-0. [MITCH] 4-0. [MITCH] 8-0. 1-5-0. [MITCH] 2-2-0. Need a hand? No, I'm good. 3-0-0. Come on, guys, let's try and get the mood light, okay? Anybody's got a problem with anybody else, it stays up top, all right? All right? [MITCH] 3-4-0. 4-2-0. 5-5-0. That is 6-5-0. All stop on the bell. KARSEN (OVER P.A.) All stop. [MITCH] Seal open, 20:00 hours. Yeah, how many? Roger that. Engel, bring all the welding rods. Front plate locked. Head forward. Clamping on. Diver one, two, and three, all locked out. Bell to divers, do you copy? Over. Diver one? Copy. There's a mirror in my bag if you need to check your hair. Over. Dickhead. Bell to surface. Comms check. How do you read? Over. KARSEN (OVER P.A.) Loud and clear. (INDISTINCT) The weight coat is damaged. The anchor dragged right across the manifold. There's a tear across the feed pipe. Make it hot. It's hot. ( LOUD RUMBLING ) ( METAL CREAKING ) All stop on the dive. Jones, what was that? I don't know, the whole bell-- Get on the radio now. Okay! Bell to surface, bell to surface. Divers two and three, are we good? Diver two, all good. Diver three, good. Bell to surface! The storm has come! Repeat, the storm has come! ( INDISTINCT ) You're breaking up! I can't hear you! Shit! The comms are breaking up! I think Karsen wants back to the surface! He said something about a storm! How much longer? A few more minutes. What? We came here to do a job. During a fucking storm, we didn't. Fuck this. Get back here, Hurst. Hurst, get back here. Engel, we need to finish the weld. Make it hot, then. Lorimer, do you copy? Hurst, I've lost contact! Karsen? Karsen, do you copy? Over. Do you copy? Hurst! It's all right. Mitchell, you need to get back here now! We're done. Get back to the bell now! Mitchell, come in! Jonesy, take up the umbilicals. We keep going in and out of contact. I'll take it from here. Jones, let's stash the hats. Karsen, this is Mitch, do you copy? Over. KARSEN (OVER RADIO) We've just been hit. ( INDISTINCT TRANSMISSION ) We need to get you-- If you can read me, we're set, we're ready for ascent. Over. Everybody get strapped in. ( INDISTINCT TRANSMISSION ) Ascending from storage depth 6-5-0. 6-0-0. I didn't even get in the water. Yeah, well, we can always leave you down here if you want. 5-3-0. 5-0-0. ( METAL CREAKING ) There's something wrong. Karsen, is there a problem? MITCH (OVER RADIO) Bell to Karsen, do you read me? Over. Bell to Karsen, do you read me? Over. Karsen, come on! What's happening? GPS signal is gone. We'll be dragged all over the ocean until we get a damn signal. Bell to surface, do you read me? Over. Why aren't we stabilizing? I don't know why we're not stabilizing. 'Cause we're in one hell of a storm, that's why! We've dropped! We're dropping at speed! Karsen, all stop on the bell! All stop on the bell! Diving! 6-0-0! Hold on, it's coming! 620! Put a hat on! Brace yourselves! Brace! Brace! Brace! ( POWER WHIRRING DOWN ) ( HIGH-PITCHED TONE ) ( SCREAMING ) Hold him down! Hold him down! Hold him down! Hold him down! Hold him! Open your jaw! Hold him down! Keep him still, Hurst! We need him still! Keep still! Easy. ( FLESH TEARING ) Oh, fuck. Barotrauma... pressure caught in a tooth cavity, under your filling. [MITCH] Bell to surface, bell to surface. Bell to surface, do you copy? Over. Internal pressure is stable. I'm gonna assess the damage. You're gonna do what? I'm gonna assess the damage. Do it. Yeah. Hurst, suit him up. Right. And check the seal. Jonesy, you all right? Oh, fuck it all. Can you stand up? You okay? Fuck yeah. Can you focus? Oxygen cylinders on port side all secure. Damage from the fall appears minimal. We got off lightly. OB3 pressure reading at 90 percent. The beacon on top of the bell is transmitting as normal. We're still pinging. Still no comms. [JONES] Why did they drop us so quickly? Listen, Jonesy, we just have to wait it out. They put us on the floor for a reason. They'll take us back up to the surface when they can. We just need to stay calm. Bell to Karsen, it's Mitch, do you read me? Over. [JONES] Why aren't they answering? They're riding out the worst of it, then they're gonna haul us back up, right? Hurst, we need an inventory of the bell, first aid box, survival suits, blankets... Got it! Flares. Blankets, first aid... no survival suits. What? There's no fucking survival suits. We should be okay. Back-up heating supply is working. Where's Engel? With any luck, he's trapped inside a whale. MITCH (OVER RADIO) Engel, give me an update. How does she look? ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Hold on a minute. I want to check the umbilical to the ship. You know your old man was always teetotal whenever we dived in Asia? That's bollocks. No, serious, he never touched a drop. He had this deep-rooted fear of the place. He was terrified he'd get pissed and wake up... with some lady boy with a big stiffie, loving him long time. You met your wife out there, didn't you? Popping out ping pongs? Yeah, I caught a few. Engel, what's the external damage? [MITCH] What's the external damage? Engel! The ship is down. What? What are you talking about? Don't listen to him, the guy's a walking, fucking Jonah. What the hell is that? That belongs to the winch mechanism. Whoa, whoa, sure, the winch mechanism may have sustained some damage. You're not listening to me. Now the ship has other means of rescue. They're going through those options as we speak. Now Jones, get on the radio. Huh? Get on the radio! And the first thing that we need to do is re-establish radio-- [JONES] Bell to surface. Bell to surface. The ship is down. Radio contact-- The fucking ship is down! [JONES] Bell to surface. I just saw Karsen's dead body on the ocean floor. There's no one there, Mitchell. We're on our own. We should have left when Karsen gave the order. We're only alive because we never made it to the surface. We got what, around 18 hours breathing supply? How long until someone finds us? I don't know. How could I possibly know that? We're around, what, five hours from Mombasa. Now the ship would have sent out a Mayday, so the rescue teams are probably under way. But once they're in range... they'll pick up the bell's location beacon. I don't know! We're in the middle of the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa. There are more pirates in these waters than there are fish. Do you really think that Vaxxilon are gonna risk sending another crew to rescue us? Yeah, why wouldn't they? [ENGEL] Vaxxilon are in lockdown. They're figuring out some PR strategy to cover their asses. They just lost one boat, they're not gonna risk losing another. Well, I guarantee you, a rescue is under way. And I guarantee you that they're already filling out their insurance claims. Oh, come on! How the fuck is this helpful? It's simple economics, you dumb ass. You're say-- you're saying they're not gonna come? He's wrong! It's in our contracts! In an emergency situation, all saturation divers are transferred to a high-- The unit went down with the ship! Okay, well, then they'll send another bell down. If? If they're looking for us! Shut up! No, you shut the fuck up! Yo! Back off! You think they would have sent us down in a storm if they gave a shit about our safety? They'll write it off as a freak of nature, as a force major, as an act of God! And your doting wife can go to your funeral... in the misguided belief that she lost a hero! Shut up! Shut up! That is enough! Now none of us wants to be in this situation... but we do what we are trained to do, we stay focused... and I promise you we will get out of here! Vaxxilon will come to get us. We sit, wait, conserve oxygen, that's it. Now, sit down! Please. We do know that the weld was at the DC178 manifold. Yeah, write this down. DC178 manifold, 19 degrees, 14 minutes south... 71 degrees, 33 minutes east. You got that? Okay, get on comms, transmit that position every 15 minutes. We're a lost bell from the DSV Lorimer. Our coordinates are 19 degrees, 14 minutes south-- We need to float the bell. Detach the clump weight and make her buoyant. We'll be a hell of a lot more visible on the surface. No, because right now, pressure is equalized inside and out. But the bell rises, the pressure drops, the chamber could become compromised... but we're not gonna know that until it's too late. If we lose pressure inside the bell, we're all dead. We follow procedure and wait for Vaxxilon. Shit! We're losing oxygen! Right! Put your emergency masks on now! The CO2 level is nearly red. My mask, I can't breathe! My mask is broken! Put the mask on! It's broke! I can't put the mask on! You need to reboot the power supply! Clear the air with a fresh O2 tank! Here, put the mask on. Hurst-- Hurst, you got my mask! Engel's down! ( COUGHING ) Engel, breathe! [JONES] Power supply rebooting. O2 levels increasing. It's stabilizing, breathe! Hurst, you're a little late. Breathe! Bell's breathing system malfunctioned. We were taking in our own carbon dioxide. Two hours... how did we just lose two hours of breathing gas? We lost an external cylinder. I know we lost an external cylinder! I sent you out there to check for damage! No, the umbilical was on the ocean floor, that took priority! That just cost us! And you'd still be waiting for a fucking ghost ship to haul us back up! We need to float the bell. How many times are you gonna make me go through this? All we have to trust in is your belief system. If we locate the ship, we'll have enough breathing gas for a month. The ship could be scattered for miles. Just get back on the comms! Then we follow the main umbilical. It has to lead us to the ship! If it's still attached. We don't know we're gonna find what we need! [HURST] I say we try. We're not gonna have enough gas. [JONES] Bell to surface. Look, we gotta do something. If the bell freezes, we die. [JONES] Mayday, Mayday. We run out of air, we die. We don't do something soon, we fucking die! RADIO OP (OVER RADIO) This is Jiuxing. Come in. I've got something! Bell to surface! Give it to me! Give it here! RADIO OP (OVER RADIO) Lorimer bell, Lorimer bell, do you copy? Over. Loud and clear. Over. RADIO OP (OVER RADIO) Position, please? Position! This is Jiuxing. Why emergency? Over. Our support vessel, the DSV Lorimer, has gone down, repeat, gone down. We are a four-man saturation diving team... in a bell 670 feet below sea level. We are in urgent need of assistance. Over. RADIO OP (OVER RADIO) We can't hear you clear. Signal weak. Are there any Chinese citizens? Negative. There are no Chinese citizens on board. But we are in need of immediate assistance. Repeat, immediate assistance. Over. RADIO OP (OVER RADIO) We-- fishing boat. Storm has damaged... Please respond. Over. RADIO OP (OVER RADIO) Losing signal. Can't help. Jiuxing, our last coordinates are 19 degrees, 14 minutes south... 71 degrees, 33 minutes east. Over. Please respond. Jiuxing, do you copy? Over. Jiuxing, please respond. We are losing signal. Bastards. Do you know how much I've spent on Chinese food? Hurst, check and recheck the cylinders on the port side. We can't afford to lose any more air. Yeah, I'm on it. EMMY LOU (V.O.) You're lucky I love your surprises. Tell me. Come on. I wanna know. Walk out to hear the first song Look back from where I came My tears are tiny storm clouds And dancing in the rain [JONES] You don't think anybody's coming, do you? If you don't have hope, what do you have? I have reason. Onboard cylinder one secure. Valve open and functioning. OB cylinder 4 secure on the starboard side. Valve and reading's normal. There's something on the top of the bell. Looks like a crane block. Hurst, is there any damage to the valve? Hold on. No, it doesn't look like it. Okay, can you make it secure? Yeah, I'm on it. It's one heavy bastard. Shit! Mitch! Mitch! Mitchell's down. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) What happened? I-- I think he got hit. No, Mitch is not moving. He's not moving. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) What do you mean, he's not moving? Can you read me? I think he's unconscious! ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Mitch, respond. Open his breathe flow. I'm trying to open it. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Right. Turn him face down and drag him back to the bell. I can't move him. There's not enough slack. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Hurst, what are you doing? His umbilical's snagged. Fuck! Fuck! It's stuck. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Detach him. The fucking thing is stuck. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Detach him. Fuck! Fuck! ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Hurst. What do I do? I can't move him. Listen to me. If you don't detach him, he's gonna die! I can't move him. I can't move him. ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ) Come on! Here you go. You're okay. You're okay. Get that weight off him. Get it off. How are you still diving? The mechanism was fucked. Your hands are useless. You have no place being on the sat team. What did you do, forge your medical records? How do you think I got these hands? Picking fucking daisies? 18 years. 18 fucking years in the water. 18 years soaked in booze. I nearly fucking died. I fucked up. I'm sorry, man. You just took your last dive. Let's get this off. CARMEN (OVER PHONE) You've got the Mitchell residence. Unfortunately we're a bit busy to take your call right now... but leave your message after the beep and we'll call you back. Have a beautiful day. Mitch. Yeah? We've lost over half of our air. We've got to do something. There's nothing that we can do except wait. Come on, even if they're in the water, how are they gonna know we're here? We don't even know where we are. [MITCH] The bell's location beacon transmits automatically. And its range is what? I don't know. 750 feet? [ENGEL] So unless the boat is directly above us, they won't know we're here. You've got to seal the bell and take her to the surface. You already know my answer. What the fuck are you waiting for? St Christopher? Great. Vaxxilon are coming, Engel, and I'm not taking that risk. [ENGEL] Of course, it's a risk. So is doing nothing. ( HATCH OPENING ) I was joking about your old man, you know. What was he like? He was a good diver. And he was a funny fucker, too. I barely saw him smile. Yeah, well, families ain't easy, are they? When you're down here, you wish you were back home. And when you're with them, you just wish you were back down here. It don't make a lot of sense. I have a son. I haven't seen or spoken to him since he was five. He's married now. I don't even know his wife's name. That won't happen to me. Yeah. That's what we all say. ( HATCH OPENS, CLOSES ) MITCH (V.O.) Even though I walk through the darkest valley... I fear no evil, for you are with me. The Lord is with you. Wherever you go. ( RADIO STATIC ) ( RADIO STATIC ) ( RADIO STATIC ) Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. Is there anybody out there? ( RADIO STATIC ) MITCH (OVER RADIO) Is there anybody out there? Hurst. What happened? Hurst's in the water. What? Hurst's in the water. Hurst, come in. Over. Oh, shit. Hurst, what are you doing? HURST (OVER RADIO) I'm gonna fix things. What does that mean? HURST (OVER RADIO) I'm gonna find the ship. You are not authorized to be in the water. I am instructing you to return to the bell now. He'll never find the ship. [HURST] I remember your first sat dive, Mitch. You could barely put one foot in front of the other. I guided you. MITCH (OVER RADIO) I remember, okay? Now, turn around. You're gonna get yourself killed. I was diving in the North Sea when they were losing over a hundred a year. That was before all of you. MITCH (OVER RADIO) And I'm telling you... to turn around. HURST (OVER RADIO) Go fuck yourself. Hurst! It's getting warm. It's so warm down here. How long have you been in the water? HURST (OVER RADIO) He's missing his dad. I'm still his dad. [ENGEL] He's rambling. It's hypothermia. They take from you, but they don't want you. They just push you-- The wreckage could be scattered for miles. Hurst. I'm gonna have to sit down. Hurst. It's too hot. It's too hot. Keep on top of things. He's gonna freeze to death. Can't we pull him in? He's too far out. The valve on his suit won't hold. Hurst, come in. Over. It's going-- It's-- Should have... Cut the gas. He's wasting vital air. We're not cutting off anybody's breathing supply. He's using three times the amount of air. The longer he's in the water, the less air we have. We don't decide who dies. Maybe you don't. One less breath in here... could be the difference between you seeing your wife and children again... or them seeing you in a box. No... no. [ENGEL] We gotta do something, Mitch. HURST (OVER RADIO) My boy never-- The free flow is pumping vital air. [MITCH] You need to respond. Over. Hurst, talk to me now. Over. HURST (OVER RADIO) My boy... it's hot-- ( BREATHING STOPS ) ( EERIE MUSIC PLAYING ) MITCH (V.O.) If we live, we live for the Lord. And if we die, we die for the Lord. So if we live or die, we belong to the Lord. Amen. ( ETHEREAL MUSIC FADES UP ) ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( GASPING ) [MITCH] Breathe. You all right? We're not gonna make it, are we? Don't lose hope. Lisa hates hospitals. She doesn't even like walking past them. Says they smell of... loss. Full of broken people. Who's gonna go with her? She'll be on her own. What's it like? What? The birth? I'm terrified of it. There ain't a man alive who's not afraid of that. I mean, one minute you're standing in this strange room and the next you're... holding this precious-- You won't ever wanna let go. I remember when Taylor was born. My first. I was stuck offshore. By the time I arrived, Carmel had been in that room for over 13 hours. She gave me such a look. You know, I mean, I thought she was gonna kill me. And then suddenly out he came. And I said to her, you know, I said... "He wasn't ready to come out. He was waiting for the right time. "He was waiting for his daddy to arrive." And she said to me, "If that's the case, Peter Mitchell... "you should have been here at the start, you idiot." How did you end up in the water? You know, the beauty of it. The peace. It's kind of like an affair, you know? I won't let go of her and she won't let go of me. ( ELECTRICITY FIZZLES ) It's the heater. Oh, shit. The element's gone. Shit. What are the options? This gonna work? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's a little crude, but... it should do the job. One homemade steam boiler. Well done, kid. Hey, at least we'll die warm. How long we got? [MITCH] A little over an hour. MITCH (V.O.) To my sweet Carmel... I'm writing these words in the hope... that you never get to read them. Forgive me. I know I should have listened when you said you wanted me to stop. Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah ( RADIO STATIC ) COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Lorimer bell. Lorimer bell. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) How do you read me? Over. Yes, yes, loud and clear. Over. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) This is the commander of the navy frigate HMS Marlborough. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Can you give me a sit rep on your number of divers? Over. We are a four-man saturation dive-- Correction. We are a three-man dive team. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Can you state your exact position? Over. Commander, we don't know our exact location. I would imagine that Vaxxilon have sent the pipeline coordinates. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Negative. We have had no contact with Vaxxilon. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Your distress signal was intercepted by a Chinese vessel. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Can you give your last known coordinates? Over. Jonesy, notebook, notebook. Our coordinates were 19 degrees, 14 minutes south... 71 degrees, 33 minutes east. Over. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Without exact coordinates, it's going to be time-consuming. Over. Well, time is one thing that we have precious little of, Commander. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Roger that, but I'm afraid we are talking hours... not minutes. We're coming. Over and out. Vaxxilon just hung us out to dry. [ENGEL] Mitch, Mitch, I've got an idea. If we can find a field marking... the drywall chambers on the pipelines carry spare cylinders. If we mix the gas with our remaining helium... it might-- might just buy us enough time. We'll have drifted for miles. There's no way of knowing where it is. It's like the interstate highway down there. Now we hit one direction, we're bound to hit a pipeline sooner or later. What if the drywall chambers are empty? We're gonna die before that ship arrives anyway. I don't think we have a choice. I'm heading out, heading north. Are we happy? I think so. One sec. I thought you said you were done. Come on, Jones. I am. I am. I am. Engel, how's the heat? More Seattle than Florida. His umbilical's at halfway. Can you see anything? ENGEL (OVER RADIO) No, not yet. Water. There must be something here. Halle-fucking-lujah. He found it. Can you see any markings? I'm by a field joint. Okay, but you're running out of umbilical. I'm at SG3A5. JONES (OVER RADIO) Yeah, I've got it. Okay, there's no weld chamber there. Okay, try the adjacent pipeline. It's about 30 meters if you head East. I'm cold. I need more heat. No. No. We're out of gas. Engel, there's no more heat. You need to get back here now. No... if I do that, we're all dead. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Bodies everywhere. I'm in situ. Where now? Southwest or northeast? Southwest. Are you sure? How far? Come on. It's 20 meters. I've found it, Mitchell. Shit. What? The umbilical's all played out. I'm at the end of the line. I can see the drywall chamber. I'm gonna detach. MITCH (OVER RADIO) No, that's not a good idea. You'll lose your comms. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Switching feed to bailout. Engel. Engel. Okay, you need to keep both channels open, and let me know if he responds. Engel, can you hear me? Engel, head back to the field joint. I'm on my way. You need to respond. ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ) Engel, do you read me? Over. I'm at SG3A5. Engel, talk to me. Mitch, have you got a visual? I'm at the end of his umbilical. He's detached. Turn off diver two breathing supply. Wait. I think I see him. He's down. But I think he's got a cylinder. Jones, he's got a cylinder. He's got a cylinder. Engel. Come on. I'm at the end of my umbilical. Can't rea-- I got him. I got him. ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ) JONES (OVER RADIO) Mitch, how much further? We're ten feet from the bell. Get ready to haul him in. ( ALARM BLARING ) Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's get you-- Mitch, hurry up! Let's go. I need you to do the cylinders. Go! Do the fucking cylinder! ( GAS HISSING ) [JONES] It's on. Oh, my god. Oh, fuck. He moved. [JONES] He just fucking moved. He just fucking-- Help me get him up. Lift him up. Get the emergency mask. Put it on him. ( BREATHING DEEPLY ) [MITCH] I don't know how he's still alive... but he's just given us another two hours. Hey, how you doing? Huh? That good? COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Lorimer bell. Lorimer bell. Please respond. Over. How close are you? Over. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) We should be in range of your coordinates within 90 minutes. But we'll still need to locate your exact position. Vaxxilon have closed all communications. We don't have the maps. We need to speed up the search. Over. What about the location beacon? Over. Are you picking up the signal? COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Negative. We can use sonar, but the ship's wreckage is scattered. It could be a long search. Over. Well, hurry up 'cause we're running out of time. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) We will contact you once we have more to go on. Over and out. Mitch, what if we float the beacon? It's still attached. How do we do that? We de-rig it, we bring it into the bell and then we make it buoyant somehow. Take the umbilical as far as she goes and then float the beacon from there. Otherwise it could get caught in the deep water currents. It's possible. Get it closer to the surface. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that could work. It has to hold. It will, but it'll drain the charge fast... so once you're set, you flick the switch and it activates the signal. The ship should be in range within the hour. Who goes? I do. [ENGEL] Where's the beacon? It'll be a couple of minutes. It was my birthday last week. Apparently I promised Carmel I'd stop diving by the time I was 35. I don't even remember making that promise. It's the longest we haven't spoken since we were 19. I don't mean anything without them. Is that sad? It's perfect. You know, I was almost married once. I'd just proposed to her and we were on our way home. She was singing along to this song that she loved on the radio. And she seemed so-- so happy. And then suddenly this-- this car appeared out of nowhere and sideswiped us. It hit us hard and knocked us off the road... through a barrier and into this lake. It all happened really fast. But then time became so... slow. It took us forever to sink to the bottom. I-- I tried to pull her out of the car... and I couldn't because she was... stuck. So I-- I told her... about all these wonderful places that we would see... and the great things that we would do. But, of course, she couldn't hear me... because she was... dead. So I-- I held her tight... and I promised her that I would never let her go. You see, it wasn't survival. It was-- it was fear. When the car had filled up with water... I rolled down the window and I-- I swam to the surface. And I-- I let her go. I shouldn't have done that. No... I shouldn't have done that. Come back to us, Mitchell. And don't let us go. Diver one locked out and set. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Slow your breathing. I'll monitor your gas levels for you here. Take it steady. MITCH (OVER RADIO) Roger that. Mitch, remember... once you're above the deep water currents... go to the end of your umbilical and only then release the beacon. Visibility's good. MITCH (OVER RADIO) Currents are strong but not too strong. Come on. Come on. How much left on the umbilical? You have another 25 feet to go. Wish I could just keep going. Don't even think about it. It can't be that far. You have to concentrate on the situation. I'm at the end of my umbilical. All right, Mitch. Hit the switch and come back down, nice and easy. I can't-- I can't get a grip. It's not turning on. The switch is... Take your time. Hang on. I'll take my gloves off. Come on. Come on. ENGEL (OVER RADIO) Mitch, you got it? I just need to-- just... ENGEL (OVER RADIO) What? What is it? I got stung! Are you okay? Hundreds of jellyfish. They're everywhere. Agh! Mitch. There are so many! Oh, no, no. I lost the beacon! Can you see it? I must have lost the beacon before I could activate it! I can't reach it! I gotta disconnect my umbilical! [ENGEL] Mitch, no. There's no other way! If you do that, you won't get back to the bell. There's no other way! Mitch. Mitch. No, Mitch. You won't get back to the-- Mitch, talk to me. Mitch! Oh, no. Mitch, talk to me! Talk to me! Talk to me! Shit! No. No, no, no, no. Kid, cut the gas! No, please! Cut the gas! No. No, no, no, no, no! He's wasting vital air! Cut the gas! He's using vital air! I'm never gonna see my girl. Cut the gas! I'm never gonna see my girl. Stop! Stop! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Keep it together! Get up! Get off me! Get off me! MITCH (V.O.) Carmel, you know, you truly become more beautiful... with every passing day... and I wanted to grow old by your side... sharing the years and watching our boys together. It breaks my heart. But I'll always be at your side if you need me. I love you. I love you all. Now and always, Pete. If they don't come, I don't wanna suffocate. I don't wanna die in that way. [JONES] I want it to be quick. I don't think I can do it myself. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Surface to bell. Come in. Over. Bell to surface. I read you. Over. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) We've intercepted your beacon which tells us you must be close. It's going to take at least an hour for our divers to find you. Over. It'll be too late. Over. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) You need to do everything you can to conserve oxygen. Over. We're gonna float the bell. Over. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Will it hold? Over. We don't have a choice, Commander. Please be ready. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) Understood. Good luck. Over. Will it work? We'll soon find out. I think she should float. ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ) Strap yourself in, kid. Things could get rough. Come on. It's happening, Engel. We're doing it, eh? Yeah. Come on! Come on! 250! Come on. [JONES] What's happened? I think the umbilical got caught. Shit! Oh, shit. Shit. What does that mean? We stay here and we use the remaining gas... or we use what we have to swim to the surface. I'll swim up, but... swim up 170 feet? One hat. Shit. We have a predicament. This is so fucked up. It's a tough, tough dive, kid. You've never gone below 30 meters, have you? It's an almost impossible dive. We need to accelerate the decompression. Once the umbilical plays out... the remaining distance will have to be done in one single breath. You think you can do it? I'm diving? It has to be you. I almost died four hours ago. I wouldn't have a hope in the water for that long. I'll adjust the partial O2 from here. Well, if you do that, the whole bell will flood. If I don't, we both die. Here. When you reach the end of the umbilical... detach and just do it, don't over think it. You'll feel disorientated, light-headed. But just listen to my words. Focus on my words and nothing else. Okay? When you get to the surface, activate this. How can you know? Know what? That you're not gonna make it. I told you, my lungs are shot. You're gonna die anyway. What's the difference, here or in the water? If I was you, I'd take that risk. We don't have time for this shit. Here. You're sacrificing your life for me. I can't live with that unless I know why. I figure I owe someone. It might as well be you. I need to know. When I swam to the surface, I waited. I waited for the driver of the other car. I would have killed him with my bare hands. And when I swam down to check if he was dead... I saw him, his kid, strapped in the back. I could have saved him. He died because of me. Now go. Come on. COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) We're scanning the surface for you. Teams are in the water. Over. Roger that, Commander. Remember what I told you, kid. Take it slow. Keep your movements and breathing steady. Talk to me. Talk to me. Kid? I hear you. Just keep going. Concentrate. Push through it. Keep going. Keep going. [JONES] I can't do this. Yes, you can. Okay, you're gonna feel pain. You're gonna feel pain in your joints. That's okay. You just need to work yourself through it. You're gonna feel as if your body's about to explode. But you can get through it. You can get through it. Kid? Come on, kid. My arms! My arms! Can you hear me, kid? I'm scared. I'm scared. I know you're scared, but you can do it! You can do it! Come on! You can do it, kid. You can do it. How much further? You've got about another 20 feet on the umbilical... and then you're almost home, all right, kid? I want you to empty your lungs of air... and then I'm gonna want you to detach. I want you to get rid of your hat. You're gonna start feeling like a lead weight... when you get to the surface, okay? Detach the hat now! It won't detach! I can't take it off! Detach! ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ) I hope you're close. I hope you're close, Commander. Come on, kid. Come on, kid. Come on. Come on. Got you, son! Hold on! Get on-board, quickly! Lift! COMMANDER (OVER RADIO) We've got him. We've got him! They've got him. They've fucking got him. They've got him. ( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING ) ( POWER WHIRRING DOWN ) ( BELL CREAKING ) ( LOUD CLANGING ) I see my window open The summer sun pours in I hear a Siren calling a tune we used to sing Walk out to hear the birdsong Look back from where I came My tears are tiny storm clouds I'm dancing in the rain Walk out to hear the birdsong Look back from where I came My tears are tiny storm clouds  I'm dancing in the rain ( SOFT MUSIC FADES UP ) ( MUSIC FADES UP ) ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING ) ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) All she ever wanted was to see a satellite She talked about its beauty and the magic of its light She went on about the future And the endless games he played Like a wave forever cresting her desire would not fade Throw it in the water count the leaps and bounds  Hear the ripples thunder causing havoc underground Sink your teeth in gently taste the blood you drew Remark upon her beauty for she's your perfect view Stillness overcame her every thought and every whim The future she had made was never meant for her or him The satellite flew over but she missed it all the same As she whispered from her row boat A prayer said in love's name Throw it in the water  Count the leaps and bounds Hear the ripples thunder causing havoc underground Sink your teeth in gently Taste the blood you drew Remark upon her beauty for she's your perfect view ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )
