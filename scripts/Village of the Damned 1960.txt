Could you pick up a book for me and bring it with you? It's... Gordon? Operator. Blast. It got cut off. That was my brother-in-law. Would you try again? I have got to change. Yes, sir. Operator, we've been cut off from Midwich 25. Would you get it again, please? Hello, will you replace your receiver, please? Please replace your receiver. - For more than an hour, you're saying. - Yes, sir. Perhaps something went wrong with his phone. This is what puzzles me. I have also tried the vicar, the general stores, and the post office. I can't get any reply from any of them. Country telephone exchanges being what they are. Yes, I know, sir, but look here. Midwich is here. Now 4th Brigade are running that exercise of theirs all round there. I don't think there's anything in it, but I was wondering... as I was going down for the weekend... whether I could have your permission to leave a little earlier. All right, Alan. - Give me a ring later. I'll be here till 5:00. - Thank you, sir. - Alan. - Yes, sir? Have a nice weekend. Give my respects to Gordon. I will. Goodbye, sir. - Hello, Gobby. - It's Maj. Bernard. What's happened to the telephones? I've been trying to get through. It's funny you should ask, Major. I've been sent to look for the bus which hasn't turned up. We can't get through by phone either. Here's your bus, Gobby. Struth. Better have a look. All right, Alan, get hold of the local Area Commander. - What's his name? - Ward Johnson, sir. Tell him to call me if he wants authorization. I'll get things moving this end. Make sure the newspapers don't get hold of this for the time being. If anything has got out of hand there, we don't want any panic. Report back as soon as you have any results. Right, sir. Get me South Eastern Command, please. Over here, Sergeant. Look, the canary. - You needn't go in if you don't want to. - I'll have a go, sir. - Quite sure? - Sir. - What on earth's happening... - Just a minute. Hello, Doctor, I'm glad you're here. We may need you. - What's wrong with him? - That's what we're trying to find out. - Will you take a look at him, Doc? - Take off the respirator. Pulse is normal. Seems to be breathing normally. I think he's just fainted. He's coming round. You better let me know what this is all about. - When were you last in the village? - Midwich? I left at about 10:00. Had a couple of patients to see in Widmarsh. Now there are road blocks all over the place. I've got to get back. I've got patients to see. My hunch is that all your patients in Midwich... are in the same state as this man. All right, old chap. Take it easy. What can it be? To put a man out like a light, penetrate our respirators, do all this. - Some sort of gas? - No, it can't be. Any breeze would have blown it about a bit. The edges of the area are as well-defined as that hedge there. Cold. - What did you say? - Ice-cold. I'm all right, sir, only cold. My hands are like ice. Midwich to Charlie Alpha. Can you see anything? Over. Everything looks all right from here. Over. Let me speak to him. Hello, Charlie Alpha. This is Maj. Bernard speaking. Can you see nothing unusual at all in Midwich? Nothing moving? No, sir, nothing. Matter of fact, that's odd. Nothing is moving down there. I can see some people, but they're not moving either. They're lying on the ground. - As though they've fallen? - Yes, sir. Right. Take it down slowly, but pull up the minute you feel anything. Feel anything, sir? - Anything unusual. - Roger. Still nothing moving, sir. Taking her down. Careful now. Easy. Another aircraft approaching. Send out a general warning now. All aircraft to avoid this area and not to drop below 5,000 feet. Yes, sir. Midwich to base. Emergency. I say again, emergency. Warn all aircraft to avoid area, Latitude 51 degrees, 10 minutes, Longitude 1 degree, 11 minutes, Maintain minimum altitude of 5,000 feet. Out. Blimey! Look! Darling, I'm sorry. I must have dozed off. Look at the time. It's almost 3:00. Why didn't you call me? I'd better go and see about lunch. Anthea. I found myself asleep on the floor. What an extraordinary thing to do. I'm cold. The fire's gone out. Did you... Did we faint? Must have blacked out. Why? My hands are quite numb. What did happen? I don't know. You're all right. - You're late. - I couldn't get through. Get through? What did you mean you're all right? How did you know? It's extraordinary, but we blacked out for several hours. - I know. - It must have been a gas leak. It was not only you two. The whole village fell asleep. All of Midwich was cut off from the outside world for several hours. - Anything registering? - No, sir, nothing unusual. Keep at it. - Mr. Zellaby. - Yes, Miss Ogle? Are these people from the telephone company? - Not the telephone company. - That's what I said. If they want to pull the wool over our eyes... they ought to try something better. - I'm trying to find out... - After all, we're not stupid, are we? What's happened isn't natural. Tell you what we'll do. I'll press for an official explanation... while you help to stop the rumors getting about. All right? Do you mind? - Soil samples? - Yes, sir. - Plant life? - Even the bark on the trees. Don't forget insects, grasses, water, metals. The sooner and more elaborate these tests can be made, the better. It's okay. This is Professor Gordon Zellaby. Yes, sir. No one seems to have come to any harm. A few cuts and bruises where they fell. Lucky no one was in their bath. They might have been drowned. Hello, Mrs. Harrington. The least they can do is offer us some kind of compensation. - But you feel all right? - No thanks to them if I do. And a large burn in my best dress into the bargain. What the wife means is... you don't hardly expect to drop asleep before dinner, do you? We've established that whatever it was, was static, odorless, invisible. It didn't register on radar. It was non-metallic. It showed nothing on our Geiger counters. You have got the reports there. There are no signs of physical, biological, or psychological changes. That's practically meaningless. For instance, serious exposure to x-rays or gamma rays... need not have an immediate effect. But these people have to be kept under observation. - And yourself. - And my household. It would be a bit tricky to put you all in a sanatorium. My instructions are to keep the whole incident out of the limelight. - National security? - Lf you like. Until we know the cause, we shan't know what to expect. Since you are there, suppose you keep an eye on Midwich for us? If you find anything, let us know through Alan. There's no need for direct contact between us. More security? Ever cautious. It gets under the skin, you know. - Anything else today, Mrs. Zellaby? - No, that's all, thank you. I'll have to get in a new supply of pickles if you go on like this. I do seem to be getting through a lot these days, don't I? That'll be 17.6. - Shall I add it to the account? - Yes, thank you. How's the Professor? He's very well. Very well indeed. Good morning. - Miss Ogle, dear. - Yes? I think there's going to be news up at Kyle Manor. News? What kind of news? Hello. I said, hello. - How long have you been here? - Ages. Liar. I have just discovered a fascinating thing. Here are the plant samples from that day. This one for example. Perfectly ordinary pelargonium zonale. What's happening is exactly what you'd expect if I made a 50% graft... Why did you kiss me like that? Come on, what's the secret? Something's afoot. Why are you so happy? Now, Gordon, I want you to sit down. Keep quite calm. There's nothing to worry about. Now. We have apparently succeeded... in crossing a Zellaby Gordonius with a Zellaby Antheum. Just what the results will be, we shan't know for some time yet. I think you should sit down. - Can I get you some tea? - No. A drink? No, that wouldn't be right. Feet up? - Something to eat? - Yes, please. What? Cheese, pickles, and half a dozen anchovies. Recently my favorite diet. Hadn't you noticed? Mrs. Plumpton at the shop has. I have been too engrossed in my work, but we'll change all that. Thank you, darling. You've made my happiness complete. But all the more so because I am old enough to appreciate it. Now then, what was it you wanted? Cheese, pickles... and half a dozen anchovies. I'm afraid there's no doubt about it. Milly... I wish there was something I could say to comfort you... 'cause I know what you'll have to put up with... from some of the people in the village over this. But you can count on me to do anything I can to help you and your child. Do you think I'd... Do you think I could... Milly, I told you, there's no doubt about it. Now if there's anyone you want me to talk to about this. But I've never... It's impossible. This is some present, Jim. Thanks a lot. Where did you say you got it? Tokyo? It's a real beauty. You can take action pictures in this light. Jan, look at me. When I learn to use this properly, I might go into the photo business. Jan, turn this way. That's right. I want to see how... What's the matter with you? Jim comes back after a whole year... and you look as if you were going to a funeral. An attempted suicide. Janet Pawle, whose husband only came back from sea yesterday. - It's dreadful. - Three other women in the village... half out of their minds. Milly Hughes, Rose Shepherd, Mary Burnett. - Please don't go on. - That's why we're asking you to tell us. Please don't keep on. Don't you see what you're asking me is not right ethically? For heaven's sake, Vicar. How do you think I feel? I married late in life. When my wife told me that she was going to have a baby... it was the happiest moment I've ever known. Don't talk to me about ethics. Don't you see that this is something which concerns all of us... that this is the one moment when it is your duty to break confidence. Very well. Four of them have been to see me. One of them is only 17. - Evelyn Harrington? - Yes. She was terribly frightened, and frankly, so am I. I know these girls. I watched them grow up. When they tell me they've no way of accounting for their condition... I am compelled to believe them. That means every woman in this village... who is capable of childbirth is going to have a baby. I can't believe it. This is not a matter of belief, Vicar. It's a matter of fact. And there's something else. All this seems to date from that day two months ago... when Midwich was cut off from the rest of the world. Who's next? This is Anthea Zellaby's, Doctor. Let's have a look at it. It's one of the most perfectly formed embryos I've ever seen. Yes, but is it normal? It's more than normal. It's a 7-month embryo after only 5 months. It's all right. I've seen the x-rays, and it's a fine specimen. Dr. Willers says it's perfect, absolutely normal. That should make us very happy. It's going to be all right. Is it? Is that what you believe? You're tired, darling. That's right. I'm tired. And do you know why? Because every night I lie awake and worry. Now you don't have to worry anymore. You don't really believe that. - Dr. Willers says... - I don't care what Dr. Willers says. All right, so it's not a monster. It's a perfect specimen. - But what does that tell me? - You're going to have a baby. Whose baby? Yours? Does it tell me what kind of life is growing inside me? What sort of brain it has? Where it comes from? Does it tell me that? Where does it come from? Stop it! You must stop it. We've got to be rational about this. We may not be any better off than any of the others... but there is absolutely nothing we can do but wait. Maybe it's ours, maybe it isn't. If it's ours, we shall know it. If it isn't... I'm afraid. I'm so afraid. I hope that none of them lives. What a ridiculous way to behave. We're still terribly busy, but Doctor said to tell you... that Mrs. Zellaby's fine. - And the baby? - Perfect. - In every respect? - Hello, Gordon. - Got a cigarette? - How about the baby? Splendid. Unusually heavy, though. Strange eyes. All right. You can go in now. - Got a cigarette? - Yes, of course. How many others have been delivered so far tonight? Anthea's my third. What about their weight? All slightly over 10 pounds. All have got these strange eyes. All that worrying. And now... Gordon, have you seen him? He's such a beautiful baby. I do love you so. He's probably jealous. Now be quiet, Bruno. Lie down and behave yourself. Handsome, isn't he? Take a look at this, Doctor. It's a section of hair. Yes, it's flat on one side, on the other an arc. Somewhat in the shape of a narrow capital "D." It belongs to my son, David. Have you ever seen such a hair type before? - Have you noticed their nails? - Yes, they're narrower than ours. Covering less of the upper surface of the digit, but as flat as normal nails. - What did the blood test show? - It's too early to tell. The blood circulating at present is still that of the mother's group. So they're apparently normal children with these exceptions: Strange eyes, arresting, I would say... an unknown hair group, and unusual finger nails. Whatever they are, their physical development is absolutely startling. In point of time, they're four months old... but their development and capabilities is that of 18 months. No, please, stop it. Won't stop. She won't stop! What happened? I was giving David his bottle. I must have forgotten to test it. It was too hot for him. He spat it out. He just seemed to glare at her. Get my bag from the car. Is that any reason to scald yourself? This box is a product of Oriental ingenuity. There are no visible means of opening it... but if you do just what I've shown you, it comes open. Now see if you can do it. That goes down. Now you've got it. Splendid. It shows I was right to marry your sister. Your family has brains. Let's see if I can do this myself. There you go. Now watch this. And remember that he's only 1 year old. Go on, open it, David. Yes, there's something inside. It's a chocolate. Come along, it's time for your bath. - This is fantastic. - You think so? Come with me. It's all right, it's only a box with a chocolate in it. I don't know, sir. I never allow her to have chocolates. It's quite harmless. I just gave some to David. But you didn't even show her how to do it. That's exactly my point. I didn't have to. If you demonstrate something to one of them, they all know it. Now watch. - I want that. - Keith, give it back to him. At once! No, Nancy, leave them alone. Ted Brower! Come inside this moment! I've told you about playing with those children before. Where's my Philip? You're always all together. It's his turn to study. He's at your home. It's his home, too. You are anxious for us to leave, aren't you? You have the same every week: You wish we wouldn't come here anymore, Mrs. Plumpton. - I never said. - It's what you're thinking. You've nothing to fear from us. However, in future, someone else will come for our order. Goodbye, Mrs. Plumpton. Good afternoon, Miss Ogle. You ready, Gordon? - Coffee? - No, thanks. Gordon, don't you think Anthea should know about this conference... what's being discussed? There's no reason to alarm her just because you are alarmed. I haven't got your cold scientific detachment. People, especially children, aren't measured by their IQ. What's important about them is whether they're good or bad. And these children are bad to everyone but you. But they are children. Children are not born with a sense of moral values. They have to be taught. - With their intellect that should be simple. - Intellect. That's all you care about. What if you can't teach them? What if you can't put the brake of morals on them? First we must try. You're blinded by this vision of intellect. You see David as an Einstein. Potentially greater. Solving the riddle of the universe. Your son, David. Anthea's son. I have no proof that he's mine. Where has Father gone? To London. You must hurry, David. Why? You'll be late. No, I meant why has he gone to London? He has some business there. - What sort of business? - A conference. Don't you like me to help you, David? Thank you. But I'm old enough to do things for myself. Father agrees with that. Darling, your finger. Let me do that. It doesn't hurt. Please don't fuss. It might turn septic. There. You said I must hurry. Goodbye, Mother. Goodbye, David. And, gentlemen, as the Home Secretary has permitted this disclosure... I can now inform you that Midwich... is not the only colony of such children. Here in a township of Northern Australia... But apparently, something went wrong. All the children died within 10 hours of birth. In an Eskimo community, there were 10 births. The community didn't take kindly to this. Golden-haired babies born of black-haired mothers violated the taboos. None survived. In the communist world... there were two time-outs similar to the one at Midwich. One at Irkutsk, here on the borders of Outer Mongolia. A grim affair. The men killed the children. And their mothers. The second, in the mountains of the Northwest. All the children survived. Our reports, though limited... indicate that they are receiving education on the highest level. All these time-outs happened on the same day as the one at Midwich. This is now three years ago. Have we established anything about the origins of these children? There is very little to go on. Zellaby, you must have some theory. May I suggest that he may be somewhat too intimately involved? My position as a dubious father is influencing my scientific detachment. - Is that what you think? - I have reason to believe so. Well, let's hear what the others have to say. Dr. Carlisle? I went into the question of mutation. Once in a great many 1,000 years, an abrupt jump may take place... in animal or in vegetable life. A new variation suddenly occurs for no apparent reason. Would that explain, why entire groups of people were... cut off for periods of several hours? No, sir. It would not. Very well. Any other line of thought? Yes. There is the possibility of the transmission of energy. May I put it this way: Already, we can direct radar beams out into space with the utmost accuracy. Electrical impulses have been bounced off the moon. And we are continually receiving impulses from other planets and stars. And impulses are energy and matter. We're aware of that, Professor Smith. But where does it take us? The Professor and I think alike. What we can do, others, elsewhere in the universe may be able to do better. Exactly. Let me get this straight. You imply that these children may be the result of impulses... directed towards us from somewhere in the universe? Of course that's just a theory. But there's nothing to disprove it. They may be a case of mutation. They may be the world's new people. What we need is time to investigate. - Time... - Just a moment, Zellaby. Gen. Leighton, you told me of some developments at Midwich. What are they? A series of casualties, mostly among the village children. In each case, after some contact with the others. Children get into fights all over the world. These were not fights in the normal sense. No direct physical violence was involved. But two weeks ago, a boy, a good swimmer... was drowned in the Midwich pond for no logical reason. Children also have accidents. Gordon, you've seen it for yourself. The extraordinary power these children have. And the sinister way they use it. Extraordinary power, certainly, yes. That's precisely why we need time. It's only a matter of time before these children get entirely out of hand. With fatal consequences. So what do you suggest? - That they be shut away. - You mean, put in prison? Bluntly, yes. You might as well do away with them altogether. - This isn't a police state yet. - But don't you see what you're doing? If you imprison them, you will deprive the scientific world... of the greatest opportunity it's ever had. - Opportunity for what? - For study. Gentlemen, a great deal has been said here about the power of these children. But nothing about the nature of this power. What we are dealing with is a mass mind. An entirely new development. Like a colony of ants and bees. These children all want to dress alike... and what one learns, they all learn. I've demonstrated this to Alan Bernard. They are one mind to the 12th power. Just think what it would mean if we could guide it. We could leap forward in science a hundred years. At the risk of being destroyed. What cannot be understood must be put away. Is that your view? The age-old fear of the unknown? On the other hand, Leighton has a point. There is a potential danger here. We're gathered here as advisors, as scientists, as government experts. Now take a look at our world. Have we made a good job of it? Who's to say that these children are not the answer? The answer to what? To wars, to disease, to human want and misery. To all of the problems we've been unable to cope with. If they don't make an end of us in the meantime. We can't throw away this potential because of a few incidents. - What is your suggestion? - I'll compromise with Leighton. Let them live together, under one roof, in our village, where they can observed. My department couldn't accept the responsibility. I personally will assume full responsibility. Just give me a year. - Mr. Home Secretary, I can't agree to this. - But all I ask is a year. Surely that's not too much time when so much is at stake. Just give me one year. Very well. I will officially recommend your compromise. Thank you, gentlemen. That's as far as we shall go today. Our next lecture will deal with structure. And by the way, don't forget you'll be living here from tomorrow. Now... Why do you smile? David? You don't know how to put your question. There isn't much point my trying to be subtle, is there? The question I was going to put was... By the way... just how deep do you see into my mind? Everything that's in the front of your mind. The thought processes, the reasoning that leads to my spoken words? We still have to master that. It will come. That's frank. Thank you, David. At least I still have some privacy. The question I want to ask is this: Are you aware of life on another planet? Then let me put it this way: It is possible that life exists elsewhere, isn't it? We don't seem to be getting anywhere. Why are you so nervous when an aircraft flies above you? You've very observant, Father. That doesn't answer my question. All right. Until recently, we haven't been able to make... - our control reach as far as a high aircraft. - And now you have, is that it? What are you going to do with that power? Father, we know what you're trying to find out. It would be better if you didn't ask these questions. We want to learn from you. All right, that'll be all for today. - David. - Yes, Father? I'll walk home with you. What I meant was that you don't have to go, David, if you don't want to. I'd rather go. Because the others are moving into the school... you feel you must, too. Is that the logic? - Yes. - Your mother is quite distressed about it. I don't really know why I should be. Lots of parents send their children away to school... and David will only be half a mile away. I suppose there is nothing that will make you change your mind? No. I think that's all. Thank you. I'm very sorry. It was all my fault. You all right? Mrs. Zellaby, I wish you'd be more specific in your testimony. I know these things are difficult... but it is our obligation to determine the responsibility for this man's death. I find it very difficult to remember. You told Constable Gobby you heard the screech of his brakes. Yes, that's right. He got out of the car. Then what did he do, Mrs. Zellaby? Then he got back into the car... and drove straight for the wall. Thank you, Mrs. Zellaby. I don't think we need go any further. It seems to me quite apparent what happened here. Edward Pawle, the deceased, his vision obscured... came close to striking and injuring a child. Then, obviously in nervous shock, struck the wall. I recommend that you bring in a verdict of accidental death. Mrs. Zellaby, you know they killed him. Ask them! Just ask them! Who is that man? James Pawle, sir, brother of the deceased. Then I shall overlook this outburst. Can't you see now that Midwich is living on top of a volcano? A force is building up. Sooner or later, it's bound to explode. We still haven't any proof. How much more proof do you need? The death of James Pawle... I'm much more aware of the situation than you think... Why not? Look what they did to my brother. - This won't bring him back. - Who's going to stop them? You can't stop them with that, believe me. They're not human. They ought to be destroyed. Go home, Jim. I said, go home! Leave here now before they get any closer. All right, Mr. Zellaby. All right, I'm responsible. I've never denied it. It's quite possible that, but for me, these two men would be alive. I was over-optimistic. There's a shindig in London. They maybe after your blood. Do you think I care a rap about that? What beats me is that I failed to reach the children. They're shouting for action, now! Things have gone too far. The village is very near panicky. If only I could got inside the children's minds and read their thoughts... since, quite obviously, they can read ours. Doesn't that assume they have thoughts in mind? As we understand them? Alan, it's for you. Gen. Leighton. Excuse me. Thank you. Yes, sir? I see. Yes, sir. It's as though their minds were surrounded by... a brick wall. If only I could break through it. Yes, sir, certainly. Have I your permission to pass this on? Right, thank you, sir. Goodbye. I'm afraid there have been grave developments. The Russian army group in the Western Urals... is equipped with a new type of gun. It can project a shell up to 60 miles. An atomic shell. Apparently they tried it out yesterday... on the village of Raminsk, where their children live. And the village of Raminsk no longer exists. - You mean everyone there? - The entire place. They gave no warning, couldn't evacuate the villagers... without the children learning what was to happen. They'd developed more quickly than ours. They'd begun to take control. An attempt to move them with the soldiers... proved disastrous to the troops and the adults. I see. So now I suppose we're going to blow Midwich off the face of the earth? No. But in view of recent events, they feel your compromise has failed. Leighton feels we ought to move, immediately, before it's too late. Destroy them? Well, they're meeting tonight to come to a decision. They want me in town. What I say is, it's got to stop! Yeah! First Ed, then Jim Pawle. The authorities don't do nothing. Are we going to wait until we all get wiped out? - No! - All right then. Those that are with me, follow me! David, come here. I want to speak to you. A man is dead. We must protect ourselves. - The law exists for your protection. - It's of no use to us. No use to you, is it? If you think you'll be allowed to live by your laws... laws we don't subscribe to... You're thinking of what happened to the others, in another country. Yes, if you know about that you should know what to expect. It will not happen to us. - You little... - It will not happen to us... because we have to survive, no matter what the cost. I don't think you'll go to London. We are now the only ones left... and you must learn that we are determined to survive. And that there's nothing you can do to stop us. You have to be taught to leave us alone. Leave us alone. He's out of danger now. Go to the library, and I'll join you there. I've never seen as severe a case of shock as this. It's medically impossible. For a while, he was totally paralyzed. Now his pupils are returning to normal... his pulse is less rapid, his color's returning. I've never seen anything like this before. - It's time London sent in some troops. - I talked to Gen. Leighton. Troops are not the answer. The children would only make them shoot one another. Tonight should be enough for all of us, even me. - What is the answer, then? - I don't know. But no more people must be hurt. Is there no limit to the power of these children? No more than there is a limit to the mind. - What do you want here? - I want to speak to my father. Why do you do these dreadful things? Wherever it is you come from, you are part of us now. Couldn't you learn to live with us and help us live with you? I want to speak to my father. The effect seems to be wearing off. Maj. Bernard will be all right. What we did was only to warn him... and all of you. Leave us, Anthea, please. You are not afraid of us. No. But I'm sorry, David, sorry I was wrong about you. If you didn't suffer from emotions, from feelings... - you could be as powerful as we are. - Yes. You'll never reach our minds. I've come to say it's time for us to go. Go where? Away from here before they try to destroy us. - What will you do? - Spread out and disperse. Soon we'll have reached the stage where we can form new colonies. In the meantime, we've attracted too much attention. You must help us to leave. How would you wish me to help you? You'll arrange a method of getting us away from here... without attracting attention. You'll find a number of families spread over the country that'll take us in. Yes, that'll take a bit of organizing. I'll need a few days. Yes. And be sure no one finds out. Otherwise, more people will be hurt. You'll tell us the arrangements you have made... when you come to give us our lesson on Friday. You won't be able to deceive us. You know that, don't you? Yes, I know that. Very well. Let us know your arrangements on Friday. Good night, Father. Good night, David. A brick wall. All right now? Yes, sight's still a bit foggy, but clearing all the time. I'll just go and tell Gordon. You remember this? You wore a dark blue dress. Your hair was longer then. It caught the moonlight. - We're ready, Gordon. - Good. I wish you'd... It's 8:15, you'll be in London by 9:30. I wish you'd let me stay here or come with us. You know that isn't possible. I've things to do here. And poor old Alan would go into the nearest tree if we let him drive. Nothing like feeling useless. You're still going to see the children tonight? Yes. - Every Wednesday and Friday. - After what happened? Especially after what happened.
