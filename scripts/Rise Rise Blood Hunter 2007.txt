That is work of the physics. Graveness, concrete. You chose the worst way to find out that you don't die. Who are? Somebody that is very interested in the man that he/she made you this. Bishop. - Do you know it? - You spoke sleeping. There are two types of people that they speak while they sleep. Those that cannot be quiet and those that have something to say. There is only a form of killing Bishop. But before you will have that to choose among what you want and what you need. - I want be alive again. - Not you can. Wonder to yourself what you want now. I want to impede them to make him/her the same thing to other people. - We will make it. - But how the encounter? I will guide you in your search. Rourke. Eve. Harrison. Poe. Bidhop. How do you know their name? I know some people. I will take you until here, then you will have to continue here. I will give you some tools. This is so that you feed. And when does he/she finish? Not I can make it. Not I will kill innocent people. In all war there is low, Sadie. And you don't deceive yourself. Nobody is innocent. Nobody. From now on, you spread that to accept your dark side. You were born again, Sadie. He/she listens your interior voice. - In what can I serve you? - I need a room. It is well. To happen the night or per hour? Different rates.

If you believe that I forgot the question that I made you - you are in a serious error. - Not I know where it is. - Do I call to the police? - That was what I told you. I believe that it should be in Red Angel. - Do you believe? - I can take you. If it is so important. You won't feel well when kill for the first time. But then it will be you easy to eat. Not let him to affect you. It was. - Now. - Curse. What was what you told me in the track? That he/she could not dance because it was very hot. How hot! He/she greets. She is my sister. What devils it is making with that crossbow? Go, go. Sadie Blake. Comely to that have a million questions. Tell to the boy that leaves. It is well. Bishop had already finished of eating up and you didn't die. So he/she told me that I finished. But I never saw anybody resist so much. You had too much blood. I knew that you wanted to stay. It is well. So you did feel pity? You have to stop to hate what you are. I began you, but you finished alone. - Alone in the morgue. - Of what are you speaking? The conversion takes three days. It is a very delicate process. It is necessary to know how to make it. You transformed into one of us because that - it was what you wanted. - Not I am as you. - Sure? - Not I am as you. - And how is Arturo? - It belongs one to you. Not it belongs only one to us. He controlled everything. Until Bishop got tired. Didn't he/she tell you anything of that? Not you would have made anything if you knew the truth. What truth? That he wants to get rid of Bishop. I prayed because you arrived, Sadie Blake. - Is that what you want? - Not I will have what I want. Then, make what you came to make. And good luck. Harrison will be who betrays Bishop. But I notice you that not confuse their disability with weakness. He/she will only give you to Bishop when you give him/her what needs. And he/she has very specific likes. There you will find Bishop. Now, veto. Sr. Harrison, we see each other in the hell. Is it well, young lady? We go, man, we already happen for this reason. - But I am coming closer. - To achieve that they say goodbye to me. From now on, you will become invisible. And I will maintain you to the so much of everything. He/she remembers that I was me who he/she brought you to this place. It is well. I know how much it means this for you. You don't know it. I meant that I can imagine it. And he/she wanted them to have you assigned the case officially... It is well, Joe. I will play ball. We go, Sadie, you don't have so much urgency. Without caring how much lie you to yourself, your heart is not able to against your nature. To face Bishop, you have to be strong. If not, all this will have been in vain. Veto the demon! - Thank you. - To where do you go? Sacred Brbara. But I conform to with that you leave me to the north. - My name is Alex. - Are you of there? Yes, I came to visit some friends. We had a party. Are you hungry? I am well. Thank you. - Not you are police, or yes? - Do I have police print? That wanted them. I asked you because he/she will offer herb. Ahead. It doesn't bother me. And then, Alex, are you married? - Children that to maintain? - Not that I know. Girlfriend? No, truly not. What do you make? You already know how we are the women. Yes, nobody understands them. Because I go to the grain. In fact, yes I have girlfriend. We all lie at some time. - He/she looks, allow me to finish this. - Don't worry about me. Will you come, or will you only look? Give me a time to relax the view. They had never told me that. He/she would make any thing for to relax the view with you. To take among my arms and to take you to house. Meanwhile, a towel reach me. At what time is the party tonight? To the stocking night. And at what time do we eat? Are you never hungry? As. You speak to me of your family. Not I speak a lot with my father. My mom became to to marry and he/she lives in Reindeer. And I have a sister that he/she was born one minute before me. He/she won't believe me when he/she speaks to him/her of you. To what do you refer? We go. Hetero, single, rich, with sense of humor. With class. There was never well-known to somebody as you. Why did you notice me? Comely to that were an adorable virgin. - To what do you refer? - Did you bleed a lot? The first time. Seriously you do want to know it? They say that the sex and the murder are those only pleasures that the man has left you/they. You are getting scared. Did I catch you for a moment, truth? Don't serve the youth, Poe a lot. He/she has to be walked with care. The rich bachelors and elegant almost always they are some sicticos. It is true. - For the Australian crocodiles. - Did you speak seriously? As for what? At about that the sex and the murder is those - the man's pleasures. - That seems in these times. - Not I wanted to sound reactionary. - And for what reason will you use me? For both. Date the turn slowly. Very slowly. Give me the telephone. - Where is Bishop? - He/she didn't tell it to me. I will facilitate you the things. You left it in a place. I cannot say it. He would kill me. Not he/she will have opportunity. He/she is escaping. Not he/she knows anything about you. He/she believes that a policeman pursues him. What police? The only thing that knows is it that it passed to the other ones. To where does he/she go? Not make pauses, because he/she makes me think that you lie. Not I am afraid of dying. Good, the things are different now. - Hello, Bishop. - Where is Poe? Not count on him. - Who does speak? - Sure you remember me. - Did I make you something? - You took off everything. So you killed to my family. - And you are the next one. - I already see. Why? Not we are so different, you and me. You and I only have , a thing in common. And that what it is? When it finishes the night, both will be dead. A man used that telephone as 20 minutes ago. It is a public phone. A lot of people use it. The one that I say has some - Are you police? - Police, lover, mates. To who does he care it? Any thing that remember it could be useful. The type entered, he/she took a I swallow, he/she made a call. Did you dress their car? Did he/she speak with somebody? No. He/she had never seen it. If you see it again, you call me to this number. Eve. Is your name? Lament to bother you. But you I heard speaking with the barman. - Are you looking for Bishop? - What do you know about him? I know where it is. - And will you say it? - I will take you. I will catch my things. - Did I exaggerate? - What do you find? Help me.

Take off the wives. I have to go to the bathroom. You continue being a murderess in series. And I hate the surprises. Get up. The door is open. Not discuss. You are the one that sends. You had a relationship narrow with Tricia? Not a lot in the last years. That doesn't mean me not to care. Do you need help? In all my life, you are the one first type that offers to go up my pants. Not I am here to flirt with you. Already coarse of conversations strangers among us. Would you rot? Thank you. Not I am medical, but never he/she had seen a fabric , that it was regenerated this way. It is incredible. Are you becoming personal? - I only went up your pants. - Very amusing. Not assume that you know me. Will we make this, yes or not? He/she remembers which the one is treatment.

Get up. - What does he/she spend? - It belongs one to them. - Bishop converted it. - Lower the weapon! - Affection? - Not I am your affection. You disgust me. I hate all that you defend. You no longer have to be able to on me. - Now I am free. - Not you are the one that is speaking. They made you this. Bishop predicted that. ,reactionary this way. Because you cannot accept the idea that I think - with my head. - No. Finally I found a place where I fit. Tricia. I am your father. I love you. Bishop is my father. And my brother and my lover. You would become crazy if you see the things that me ago. He completes me. And you you are not anything for me. - Anything. - Lower the weapon, now! And I won't let you to destroy the only good that have in the life. No! - He is not your master! - Get lost. Why do you help him? He/she wants to get rid of us. Not he/she understands anything. You have five seconds for to tell me where Bishop is. Five. Four. One. Fair when you believe that there won't be surprises. It completed 18 next week. It has never been in New York. I can understand the one their father's behavior. But why do you make this? - You belong one to us. - Not because I chose it. To choose? What it is that? Nobody chooses anything. You chose to violate me and to give me for dead. You are being infantile. Everything happens for a reason. You are deceiving yourself with the idea of a vengeance. Perhaps be only an excuse to transform into it that you are in fact. Not I am as you. Not you believe that all we are afraid and we are - confused at the beginning? - Not I am as you. It continues repeating it and such time you convince yourself to yourself. You are crazy. My lunatic definition is a person that believes that their don is a curse. And he/she believes that he/she doesn't have election. I choose to experience all that the world has to offer to change of an unconscious life. Nobody will miss to those good for anything, Sadie. What will you choose, Sadie Blake? You honest. Because you are dead if you are it. And you are dead if you are not it. I prefer to be dead. That it is this way. You know, Eve made a mistake regarding you. Not you should be another thing that a beautiful sacrifice. In that case, you have taken a lot in dying. But he/she always remembers, Sadie that you are not only made of shades. Not you are as them. That is an it details crucial. He/she is your don. - Am I dead? - Not I know how to answer you. I sit down it if you are dead. Be quiet. This will hurt you. - What do you believe that you make? - Treatment of stopping the hemorrhage. It is well, I called reinforcements. They are already in road. Not I arrived until here to leave walking. What I mean is that you cannot even walk. I won't leave of here until the dull thing. Not you have your cross. Stay with me. Another time. How can you help her? She killed your daughter in cold blood. Go irony. All you are same. They are always about saving to mistaken people. Be quiet. Get up, Sadie. I will tell you the truth about your daughter. At the beginning I found similar to the other ones. A confused adolescent. But while more he/she knew it, and I refer to know it very thoroughly, more you he/she made me a revelation. Your girl was wonderful. You should know it. Allow it to go. It is certain what you/they told me of you. At the end always flaws. No you pay attention to the details. Lament that of your daughter. Seriously that yes. It was already dead. Me also. We go, it finishes with this. Not think. - Only make it. - Sadie. You owe it to me. Not I can live this way. Make it. Please. Please.
