They were just normal guys, you know, like, everyday, the kind of guys, you know, you would just go watch a football game with or, you know, have a beer. They're not crazy people. They're just regular guys. Um, and it's not like them to just take off. Reid was the best brother anyone could have. He always took care of me. This is the old Reid over here. He was really great at sports and really liked to play the guitar. And then this is the new crazy Reid. All this crazy reading material about UFOs, weird DVDs and maps. Reid stopped returning my phone calls. And then I got really scared when he got fired. As I said, he was a great, great, uh, asset to the company. But about three months before he disappeared, he had a real change in attitude. He came to work late. He spent a lot of time on the Internet. Stuff that we found in his desk after he left, a bunch of color pictures of UFOs. My brother wouldn't just disappear. Three people aren't just gonna disappear. Something is going on. And the fact that nobody knows anything, nobody will talk to us... Everybody's avoiding us. For what? Somebody knows something, and they're not telling us. I would think that a person who tried to sneak into Area 51 and get video, even a person who succeeded in getting that video, would be in serious trouble. The camera's the girl? The camera is the girl. Like, practice with it. Like, what do you say to these girls? Hello. My name is Reid. What's yours? And then we'd start a conversation about, you know, what the other one does... Fascinating. This is like a brand new... It's like a... I might try this tonight, I don't know. This is a new thing. It's revolutionary. We just need Ben not to screw it up. Oh, I will not screw it up. You are a massive cock block. - I am not a massive cock block. - Yes, you are. I am a good friend that just tries to encourage his roommate... For the record, I will never block another man's cock, all right? Says the man in the sherbet cardigan. Okay, first of all, this is not sherbet. This is a salmon-colored cardigan. You looked up the def... - Yeah. - Great, let's hear it. It's a picture of your face, man. Reid, I don't see any houses up here. Oh, here we go. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Rub my stomach? What happened to, "Hello, Reid"? - First, bar. Then beer pong. - Done. Shots, shots, and shots and then beer pong. See you tomorrow. Take one. Oh, Jesus. Thank you. Thank you. Take one. Pass it down. Take one. Pass it down. Cheers. All right, cool, just don't drop it. All right. My babies. If we win, you have to jump in the pool naked. You know I like being naked. I'm not worried about that. I was talking to Danielle, but if you... I'll make that bet for both of us. You have to sing karaoke. You have to rap. Oh! Danielle and I are the ultimate partners. We're gonna be here all night. Son of a bitch! Damn it. Chug-a-lug, Reid. You know what this means? You know what this means? It's karaoke time. Yeah, buddy. Just warming you up. My friend, Darrin. Oh, shit! Perfect! - Hey, how are you? - What's your name? Monet. Monet? Of course it is. - Self-proclaimed... - Party whore. Yes. What do you do? How much? I'll give you a slice of pepperoni. - Darrin. - What? Look at Reid, man. Really? We're doing this? You like my B? This is my B. Oh, you wanna do this? All right. Reid! And she's gone. Okay. Do it! Follow me. - Drop the beat. Give me a beat. - Help me out. Yo, my name is Reid I'm here with Darrin He likes his cardigans Looking like an orange  What? Reid! Fucking pussy, he left. Now that really killed the party. Whoo! Where is Reid, man? Do you see him? I have no idea where he is. All right, this is Michelle. Michelle is... Nicki. Nicki. Nicki is from... Hold on, hold on, hold on. Look, dude, it's Reid. - Is he really? - Reid. Reid. That's what he was wearing. Reid. Yo. You think he's got a girl with him? That's trippy... He's just drunk. Whatever. Don't worry about it. He's not responding, man. Well, text him again. Did you see Reid? Reid, where are you? Reid. It's not Reid. Sorry, I'm sorry. Ben. Come on, already. He probably just went home or something. So much fun, man. Dude, did you see my cannonball? Look at this road. We're, like, in the middle of nowhere land. That's what I was saying earlier. I don't know where the fuck I am. Maybe you shouldn't have gotten... What if Reid's lost in the forest? I think he is lost in the forest. So I was trying to fucking look for him. I think he's loving a woman right now. I don't know where I'm going. I need to make a booty tex-age. Oh, shit! Dude! What are you doing, man? What? What? Is that Reid? That's fucking Reid. Fuck. What is Reid doing in front of the car? What's going on? Hey, you all right, man? Yeah. Are you stoned? Did you get really fucked up at the party? I thought you were with that girl this whole time. Reid, what happened, dude? Let's go home. Why are you in the middle of the street? Are you all right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let's go. This night's fucking over. Here we go. Here we go. You're ready to go? Yeah, I'm good. You boys ready to get this started? Ben, have you packed? I'm good. Ben, is that really all you're bringing? It's all I need, gents. Suitcases are overrated. Let's see. Cowboy boots, bandanas, and a pink wristband. You're good to go. All the necessities of life, man. Put it in your bag. - You wanna borrow? - No. I like my trash bag. I think it's classy. I could have made this website. Uh-huh. Yeah. You're packing a lot of stuff. We're gonna need all these suits. Yo, Darrin. I wanna show you something I found. A little story for you guys. Iraqi insurgent thinking, "I'm gonna do some terrorist activity here against Americans." Uh, they think no one can see 'em. Where are you going with this? So, I think they remind me of you and Reid. "We're fine. It's nighttime. You can't see us. "Who can see at night?" And... "No! What's happening? No! Run! Run, Ahmed. "Oh, Ahmed, you're dead too." And that, my friends, is what happens when you fuck with the American government. They fuck you up. They're not gonna be able to see us. 'Cause we got these. I have a plan. There's always a plan, Ben. Sure, there is. Got to take this. Whassup? No, we're going out of town for the weekend. Secret mission. Yeah, that's right. Hey, is Ben still on the phone? No, I cannot tell you where we're going. It's a pretty good opportunity to try this thing out. Sure. I don't think girls... I'm just gonna find his frequency. What? Really? Ready. - Ready. - Ashley? Told you it would work. All right, I'm going to cut it off. Let him get back on the phone. Hey, sorry, I don't know what happened. Yeah, we'll definitely... Mini-golf date is set. God damn it. Stupid phone. What are you guys doing? The jammer works. We need flashlights. What are the tennis balls for? Don't worry about it. Four cameras. Yes. Six batteries. Two, four, six, yep. You really need four cameras? Wearable. So we can attach to our clothes whatever, under our arm. Comes pretty handy. And, as you can see, that is you. - Sweet. There I am. - There you are. It will come in handy at some point. There's so much cool shit on this table. Ben, be careful with that, all right? Just don't drop that. Okay, pills. Just three, just three. Okay, I'm good. Darrin, where are you? Dude, we got to get going. Come on out, buddy. Dude, those ammonia pills are brutal. You're doing a lot of work there, Darrin. It's an essential part of the trip, Darrin. Hey, when did we get this? Taser gun? Taser. God, I love America. Don't mess with that thing, all right? Oh! Careful. Careful, dude. You can shock yourself. Do you really think that can fuck someone up, though? Yeah. Come on. Come on, let's get packing. Dude, are you all right? Okay, that hurts a lot. Are you okay? Oh, man! Oh, that will work. That will take someone out. Feel like I'm more of a man now. It does really work. That's what you look like right now. Never leave dangerous toys around children. Let's go. You nervous? Huh? We're doing it. We're doing it. It's gonna be awesome, dude. This is what's gonna happen. We're gonna drive up to the border, or wherever I'm dropping you guys off, uh, say our goodbyes. You're gonna get out of the car, Reid's gonna get out of the car. Walk about 15 feet, and then you're both gonna be shot in the head by snipers in the hills. And I'm gonna be crying in the car because my two best friends are dead. We're not gonna get shot, all right? You'd cry for us? The worst that could happen is we get arrested. And we're not gonna get arrested 'cause I got a plan. It would be easier to rob a bank than to break into Area 51. And people that rob banks get shot. That's 'cause a bank expects to be robbed. Nobody expects anyone to break into the base. That's because it's impossible. Ben, look at this. Look at all this land mass here, okay? How are they gonna patrol all that? It's not possible. This guy we're gonna meet tomorrow, Norio, walked across at daylight. It's the size of Connecticut. You can't patrol all that. It's a top secret government base. There's probably a bunch of other things happening... There's no way they have dudes all around this circle. Yeah, there's motion sensors, there's ammonia sensors. There's all kinds of security measures, but we're gonna get around it. You're gonna get around it until you're shot in the head. You guys are all talk. This is never gonna happen. I understand that Reid's gone a little crazy in the last three months. No offense, Reid. Who wouldn't want to see this? You wouldn't want to see footage of Area 51 inside of the base? I don't understand why you're so confused why I wanna go. Because this has been, this has all happened very quickly, and suddenly we're going there. And I don't know why you have just accepted it. All I know is that no one has ever seen footage of the base. No one's ever been there. No civilian's ever seen it. We could be the first ones to do it. That would be the biggest... What could be bigger than that? Really good job manipulating Darrin, Reid. Just drive us to the border, okay? Hello? We're, uh, about a couple hours from Vegas. Yeah, he's talking to that girl again. She's not crazy. You've never met her before. Yeah, but he hasn't either, man. He trusts her. He already told her what we're doing and everything. I don't know why he thinks this girl's so legitimate. You know, her dad worked there. No, her dad wrote a book and claims he worked there. You guys don't know anything about this chick. You're just trusting her. I can make a fucking website. Even if she shows up, Reid doesn't really know anything about her. What's the deal, dude? We're good. She's gonna meet us tomorrow. Just because someone wrote a book... If he went to MIT and did work for the government, it makes sense that he'd be able to write a legitimate-sounding book. That doesn't mean it's legitimate. Well, that's what we're trying to find out. And then he killed himself, so he's clearly stable-minded. You don't have actual... Ben, Ben, Ben, okay. We know how to get past the security measures outside the base, but we don't know what to do when we get on the base. I need his information. She's the only one who has it. So if she is full of shit, we can go home? If she's full of shit, we gotta find another way. You don't have to say anything to her. Oh, I'll say something to her. Don't. Don't do dick. Please don't. There we go. I talked to, uh, Glenn Campbell. Okay. The guide, and he's gonna show us this, like... Who are all these people you're talking to? Cameras, wearable cameras. I'll wear one, and you wear the other. Okay. We'll check for night vision. There's no way I'm wearing one. You can get that shit into a strip club and the bouncers and all that... There's a lot of security at strip clubs, I know, trust me. And if you can get that shit in there and no one finds out, you're gold. Okay! Vegas! Enough Area 51 talk! That's the least I've ever been excited about going to Vegas. Look at this. Just like Candyland. Look at that. Take a picture of that beauty. - Hi, guys. - How you doing? How are you? We're gonna check in for the Hooters. Oh... Wow. Beautiful. Kidding me? No way. Dude, this place is ridiculous. There's a pool table? There's a pool table! Reid, what are you doing, dude? Check it out. This is what I was telling you about. It's JANET airlines. You guys kidding me right now? We're in heaven. Going to look at boobs. What are you doing, weirdo? Dude, check out this thermal feature on the camera. Let me see. See, it's picking up your heat. Crazy. I got an idea. Let me know if it picks this up. Oh, God! This is not gonna be pretty. Now look. That looks like boob prints! Those are my blueprints! Seamless Gentlemen's Club. We good? Can't see anything. Dude, move. You're blocking my view. Let's go in the private room. Nice. Night vision. Better get some ladies in here soon. I'm gonna be doing this the entire time. - They coming in? - Yeah. They better come in soon. Hey. Ready for some fun? Hello, hello. Yeah, I think he needs a lap dance first. That guy needs a little bit first. This guy? Do these guys first. I'll go after. All right, all right. I'm not gonna complain. That's fine. You know, I'm happy regardless. You are a gentleman and a saint. You are a gentleman. And a very good friend. Hope you have a good view over there, Reid. I am looking at it. Looking and experiencing are two different things. See, Reid, it's a... I don't know, but that was the greatest moment of my life. Do you know how much trouble we could have gotten in for this? To Vegas. To Vegas. To best friends. To the trip of our lives. Rise and shine. Ben. Hey. What? Get up. What are you doing? Oh, man, you look beautiful. Why are you recording me right now? Look at all the fun we could be having walking down the strip, drinking some beers. She's there. She's texting me. She's not crazy. How do you know that, man? 'Cause I've talked to her. We have no idea who we just sent our best friend to meet. Let's hope she can help us, right? Yeah, what if this is a setup or something? Does he know what she looks like? How is he gonna... I don't know. Oh, wait, that's her. Shaking hands. - Have you zoomed in? - Yeah. What does she look like? She doesn't look crazy. Does she look crazy? Are her eyes glowing? No, she doesn't look crazy. She looks normal. Well, hopefully, she's not legit or he freaks her out. And then we can go home. Right. He's pointing at us. Should we wave? She has something. She gave him something. She gave him papers or something. Yeah, he's bringing her out here. Okay, dude, just act normal, all right? Don't be a dick. It's gonna be really hard not to be a dick. He's bringing her out here. She's looking all sketchy. They both look real sketchy. So this is Jelena. What's your name? Jelena. - Jelena? - Darrin. Hi, I'm Jelena. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you. All right, guys. Uh, follow me. Okay. Just like that? She's not shady. Is she, Reid? Yup. Well, apparently, we're going into storage. 'Cause nothing good happens at a storage facility. Case in point, have you ever seen Silence of the Lambs? It's one girl, okay? She could very easily kill us. And store our bodies. We can take her. Well, I know if a gun gets pulled out, I'm running. He became really paranoid. He kept talking about how our phones were tapped and how there were people following him and all kinds of crazy stuff like that. And he made me promise that if anything were to happen to him, I would move all his stuff to a storage facility. Somewhere secret that no one would be able to find. He was extremely adamant that I did it right away. So the night that he died, I brought his stuff over here. And, it's crazy, literally within 24 hours, our house was raided. They want what's here. He was fired for asking too many questions. I was the one that found my dad in the garage that night. Look at this. They ruled it as a suicide. He would have never killed himself. This whole thing's been redacted. I know. - Your father? - Yeah. Looks like a nice guy. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, he was a really good guy. Holy shit! This is a timeline of all the employees. This is incredible. Thousands of people's medical records. Malignant prostate? I don't know why he'd have that. - Come here. - What? Yeah, these are my dad's maps of the base. Seriously? Of course, he wasn't allowed into all the buildings but this is what he's got. Everything above ground is just a front. The real base is a mile underground in S4. He wasn't allowed in there. Marked different staircases and elevators. That could be how you get underground. It would be real helpful when we get to the base. Even if you make it on the base, this isn't going to help you. You need fingerprints. You need a badge. They have access codes that change every day. Well, your dad didn't have access to it, so he obviously snuck in. Yeah, and my dad's dead. You really want to go through with this? Yeah, I don't have a choice. Looks like your dad was able to get into S4 but just not, sort of, parts... Well, he was following someone. This guy, I know I have his picture in here somewhere, who did have full S4 clearance. And I know that my dad was following him. There we go. The guy. I don't know his name. I just know that that's the guy my dad was following and the reason why he got fired. Well, if he does still work there, I think we could find him. He probably lives in or around Vegas. Reid, if this is for real, this is what got her father killed. Yeah. We'll be careful. Hi. Norio? Yes. So let's say we get to the top of the ridge here, say I want to do more than just look at it. Say I want to get down into S4. Get out of the car and just keep walking along this boundary fence. Most of the heat sensors and motion detectors are along this Groom Lake dirt road. There are no motion sensors over here? There are very little. Rattlesnakes? Yes, there's rattlesnakes all over. S4 is down here, right? S4 is down here. Can we get over that mountain? As long as you're not detected. The JANET airlines. The terminal. 737 outbound jets right there. The one with the red stripe? Yes. In fact, you can see the parking lot over there. Darrin, I think this is his flight. How do you know? The tail numbers. We gotta go. - Right now? - Yeah. We got to get there before they deplane. I'm going as fast as possible, man. Take a right, take a right. Am I going in there or what am I doing? Okay... What? This is it. This is JANET terminal. This is JANET? There's a lot of cars. The dude could be anywhere. So they fly the employees in and out of this base every day? Yup. Here? Yup, every day. Who's JANET? Uh, it stands for Just Another Nonexistent Terminal. That's the rumor. It's a stupid rumor. I think I see him. Can you see him on there? Yeah, yeah. I'm zooming in. White hair, glasses, getting in a small black car. Oh, shit. Reid, Reid, it's him. Right there, right there. Follow him. Okay. Give him a little space though. Put it in drive. Here we go, here we go. All right, go. So I'm just following this guy? Yeah. Can you zoom in on him? Yeah. It's him, dude. It's definitely him. I can see him in his mirror. He's wearing black glasses. White hair. He's the exact guy in the picture. So do you have a plan though? I got a few ideas. Would you like to share them or are we keeping that to ourselves? Okay. What if he's a janitor? He's got to be a high-level employee. What, are you just gonna hit him over the head? Dude, don't lose him. I'm not losing him. Speed up a little bit. What if that guy knew that Jelena's dad was following him? What if this is the reason Jelena's dad was killed? I suddenly don't like this idea anymore. You're doing a great job. Thank you. It's almost like you've done this before. I actually might take up a new career. Stalking people? Following people? Uh, PI. Thank you. You don't see anything? Dude, put the camera down. Put the camera down. All right, stay back, stay back. Let some cars get between. Stay a good, like, 50 yards behind him. More than 50. Whoa, whoa. You want me to just drive past him? Drive past him. Drive past him. - This is his house. - Go, go, go. - Put the camera down. - Relax, relax. Go down the end and turn around. So what's the plan, this stakeout? We wait. For how long? We gotta stick around to see if he leaves. Great. Food in here, man? Definitely did not plan this stakeout very well. Supposed to have coffee. Supposed to have donuts. Darrin, make sure the camera is on that house. - All right. I'm on it. - Any movement. What do you think, dude? If he doesn't leave, plan B? Reid? Yeah, what is the plan here, Reid? Anything? No, no movement. Shit! We gotta take those pills again. Any food or anything to go with this? I mean... Sorry, man. Here, man, I have food. Beef jerky? Why would you not tell me you have something? Because you're gonna eat the whole fucking bag. I'm not gonna eat the whole bag. I don't remember if you guys were there or not, but I think I've told you that we were making out and I thought there was a chair behind me and I'd sit down... - And it was a... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Reid, where the fuck, where are you going? Reid, where... Where the fuck is he going? Shh, shh. Wait, wait. Holy shit. He's leaving. What is he doing? Okay. Just wait, just wait. Holy shit. Where is he going? Come on. Darrin, what the fuck is he doing? Hold on. Oh, my God. What is he doing? Wait. He's breaking in. Darrin, we can't let him break in. I'm gonna go help him, okay? What? Just relax, relax. Look, take this. Call me if you see anything, okay? Darrin, you can't just fucking go in there, man. Let's do this quickly. Dude, I can't see shit in here. No lights. Use the night vision. Okay. - This is his office. - Yeah. Fuck! It's locked. We gotta break in. What the fuck was that? You hear that? Go check it out. Oh, fuck! Help! Reid! Reid! Help, Reid. Throw the jerky. Throw the jerky. Fucking A. Just feed her something real quick. - She's nice, she's just... - Okay. Christ! Let's keep looking. See anything? Darrin, I'll keep looking down here. You go upstairs. Toys, toys, toys. Reid, you find anything? - No. You? - No. Nothing, man. Keep looking. All right. Okay, come on. Come on. Master bedroom. Shit. - Ben? - Darrin, they're home. What? What, are you fucking serious? Dude, get the fuck out of there. Dude. Reid, Reid. He says they're coming back. He says they're outside. What? Wait. I could have sworn I fucking heard something. Fuck! They're back. They're back. You go hide! Fucking hide. Go fucking hide, man. What the fuck! Fucking shit! You are so good... Yeah, you are. Fuck it. Good girl. Let's go brush your teeth. Yeah, right here. Come on in. Hey, where's my toothbrush? Right there. One more pass. One more pass of the toothbrush, please. You're tired. Okay, here we go. You're tired. All right, say goodnight to the elephant. Bye. Bye-bye, all right. Goodnight. Let's go. Come one, let's go night, night. Dad will come in and say goodnight in a few minutes. I haven't heard anybody move in a while. We shouldn't have done this. This was dumb. Jesus! Shh, shh. Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Look. I think he's got it in there. I gotta go look. It's his fucking bedroom. It's okay. Just relax. Let's get the fuck out of here. Shh, shh. Go, go, go, go, go! Start the car. Start the car. Go. Go. Shit. Holy fuck. I fucking got it. What the fuck just happened? We got it. We got it. Got the badge. I don't give a fuck that you got the badge. I mean, you just fuckin' broke into someone's house. No. That was home invasion, breaking and entering, robbery... We got what we came for. - They didn't see us. - Yeah. He works for the government. Okay. But they didn't see us. It's 10, 15 years in jail. What if they woke up? Look, they didn't see... They had a kid! We're fine. We're totally fine. What if one of the neighbors saw my license plate? No one saw you. How do you know that? - They didn't. - No one saw us. They didn't, man. We're fine. Yeah. Look, it's all good. No. No, it's not. We're done. What do you mean, done? This whole plan is fucked. I'm going home. Ben, this was the plan. No, this wasn't the plan! Relax. Breathe. Jeez. We're cool, okay? Just head towards the desert, all right? Sorry. It's not okay. It's going to voicemail. Hey, Jelena. We got... We got the badge, it's on. We're headed to Rachel. Talk to you tomorrow. Hey, Ben, where's Reid? Where is he? Dude, he's over there, man. Jesus. What the fuck, he's standing right by the road. I gotta go take a piss. What the fuck's he doing? You have to help me talk him out of it, man. I'm not talking him out of it. Dude, you have less than a day. I'm not gonna talk him out of it. Dude... Why'd you come with us if you didn't want to do this? I didn't think it was actually gonna get this far, man. So you think we spent three months planning this and now we're gonna back out? Come on. You really ready for the consequences? We have a plan! Like last night? And that worked. Now we have everything we need, okay? We're here. This is happening. This is our chance. Look where we are. This is it. Base 5 is right over those mountains. We're ready. All right. It's all set. See those mountains over there? Uh-huh Okay. On the other side of those mountains is Area 51. That's super cool. We're literally in the middle of nowhere. This is, like, where people get killed. Little A'Le'Inn. Oh, that's so clever. It already looks like a major downgrade from the Hooters' presidential suite. Straight out of Psycho, I do not wanna go in there. What the fuck are we doing? It could be worse, dude. What are you talking about? This is awful. This is where people make meth. It's not terrible. This would be a good home base. What, it's just a couple of days. Hey, you think we could talk to some of these locals real quick? Talk to a few people. Yeah, quickly. All right. Let's do it. Look at this guy. This guy is hanging out by himself. We should definitely talk to this guy. Hi, gentlemen, how can I help you? - Hello, how are you? - Hi. - Yeah. - What brings you here? Well, what brings everyone here? The aliens. That's why you guys are here, right? With your cameras and... Here we are, you know, trying to pretend they don't exist, and I just don't understand why. The evidence is obvious. I mean, it's even in the Bible. It's in Ezekiel. You know, "The chariots in the sky." Why does America deny UFOs? There's other countries that don't deny UFOs, why does America deny UFOs? Stuff like in Mexico City... Sculpture where the guy's sitting in the chair, it's like he's sitting in a rocket, and he's got controls in front of him, he's got the breathing apparatus. People don't want to look. People don't want to know. Roswell, 1947, right? The crash. They move all that stuff here in 1951. We're reverse engineering the spacecraft right now, right over there. What you see on a map? That's just what the governments are willing to let you see. Our government does nothing in front of us. And so, there's a lot of hangers, a lot of infrastructure underground. I would be skeptical, too, if I thought there were these comic book little green aliens. They're not these furry, little sweet creatures, they're scary, man. The one that he saw had rows of teeth, you know, like, several back... The eyes, black. Just endless black pit. It's like white blood, you know? They shed their skin. He's like a snake, but these giant patches... It's not just your body that they probe, they probe your mind. They can control your mind. Throw you against the wall out of nowhere. You can tell when they're around, too. You get these migraine headaches. I mean, beyond anything you could ever imagine. You get nosebleeds. You hear about those people having those near-death experiences, and the whole thing about, "Walk into the light! Walk into the light!" That's what that is. It's almost like you cease to exist for a bit. You have no idea what happened at the time. It's just white. Like eternal endless white. You can't see where the floor stops and the ceiling starts. How do you even know you were on the ship? You don't. Experimentation, the dissection, everything we've done to them, it's Guantanamo Bay, man. You just better hope they never get out. They have their own police department, they got an underground transportation system, and they have their own government. Area 51, man, it's the 51st state. Here it is. It's right up there on the left. This is a little creepy, man. What if this guy's crazy? He's fine. He's totally normal. Glenn? Yeah. You Reid? Yeah. Nice to meet you. Reid's finally found his best friend. - Hey, what's up, man? - Where are we going? I guess you're coming to Area 51, eh? This road will take us down to the border. It's one of the main access roads to the base. What kind of security might we run in to? At the border, always on the same hill. You see the camo dudes, you see two guys in a white Jeep Cherokee. Right. They're always there, 24 hours a day. I'll drive along with the little frequency detector and when this thing pops off, it tells me, "I just ran over a road sensor." Slow down. Slow. Slow. Look around in one of these bushes and see if you can... Oh. - Right there. - Okay. Oh, yeah. If you didn't know this was here, this would look like a plate of grass to you. There's your antenna. There's no way you'd find this without some sort of electronic aid. Look at that "US Government Property." We're on public land, mind you. All right, there we go. Okay. 2-0-2-2. This was gonna send out the code 022. The camo dudes are gonna come along and investigate, and see who's approaching the border. This is the simple stuff we find outside the border. Inside the border, you may have your ammonia sensors, you may have your heat sensors. If you can defeat this unit out here on public land, you'd probably be able to defeat what they have inside. There's a car over there. That's them. That's the camo dudes? Those are the camo dudes. I'm not gonna get a sniper bullet in my head right now, am I? Just pull over on to the side of the road, right here. Just pull up to that area. Is there a guy there? Can you see? You got a, uh, telephoto on that? Yeah, I zoomed in on him. Can you see if there's... They even got the binoculars on us right now. Really? Two guys, right? Yep. Up there in that ridge, there are two tripods. There's one. One of them is pointing toward us. And there's another one right there. The other one is pointing toward the road we just came down. So, if you have a vehicle, there's no real sneaking in. We're really getting out of the car right now? Yeah. These are your camo dudes up here. Are you the happiest human being ever, right now? - Yeah. - This is amazing. Right over there. Everything you've ever wanted. This is almost as exciting. Yeah. This could be used against you... If I had a choice, I'd be at a pool in Vegas right now. We made it to the border. Oh, there's another one. We're tourists, guys. Sorry. So, what brings you out here? Oh, work. So, I'm really just out here. Since I was close, I decided I should come by and do the touristy thing... You guys have fun. Okay. All right. Thanks. Here's a guy with no license plates. Yeah, you're a tourist. Sure. That guy is a security guard, huh? Undercover. Just don't do anything stupid, okay? You got it. Thank you, Glenn. Later. See, I told you he wasn't weird. Right over there. It's so close. I can taste it. - Now let's go talk to that guy. - What? Huh? Let's go talk to this guy. Come on. Err... Hey, uh, sir, what are you looking for? See anything? You think I wanna come out here? They make me come out here! Okay. All right. Let's go. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. Don't talk to the locals. Ben, don't antagonize strangers like that, dude. What? I didn't know he was gonna be crazy, dude. The door's open. What? Did you leave it open? No. We have all our stuff in there. I didn't leave it open. Dude, open the door. You kidding me? - Hello? - Fuck. Dude. Anybody here? It looks the same. It's all here, I think. It's everything. What if someone fucking bugged the place. Hello? What the fuck? Hey. Hey. - Oh, my God. - Jesus Christ! Dude, are you... I knew you'd get here. Hi, guys. What are you doing here? Yeah. What are you doing here? We gotta get moving. Let's go. - I'm coming with you guys. - What? I asked the guy up front. Fuck. They've got ammonia sensors all over the base, so these neomycin pills will mask our ammonia levels. Okay. Darrin and I have been taking them for a few days now, so we're gonna have to triple your dosage. Well, are they gonna work? Hopefully. Might have to test your levels before we leave. Keep moving. We have a lot to do. Terrible idea. Darrin, you need to take two. Say something, man. You shouldn't... I don't know what that is. Just tell him that it's not okay with you, dude. Hey. Maybe we don't bring her with us. What? We shouldn't bring her. We don't need her with us. What are you talking about? She's gonna get us caught. She's not gonna get us caught, we have the Freon suit. So what? That's not a good enough reason, okay? Dude, we can't tell her no, okay? She's helped us out, she gave us all the stuff, she gave us the maps. Okay. Well, the ammonia pills, okay? The level's gonna be way too high. I know, all right? We'll test her before we go, if it doesn't test out, we won't bring her. Okay. Darrin. Look, I'm trusting you guys with everything my dad left me. This is all her stuff, we wouldn't be able to do any of this without her. Look, you guys have your reasons, all right? And I have mine, and I need to do this. I just... I don't want to be here if you really don't want me here. I think she could help us. You really think so? Yeah. I know I can. Ready for a 9-mile hike there and back? It's 11 miles. And, yes. We good? It's fine. - Is it in? - Yeah. Like an actual motion sensor? Like, we went to the border and took one. You're kidding. There she is. All right, we jammed the signal. What? It changes frequency after, like, 30 seconds. What does that mean? It means we have to detect the signal, jam it, and then disable it before it changes frequencies. Fuck. Look, nobody said it was gonna be easy. So, this is the access card we got off your dad's friend there. And that... This is his cologne. There you go. Did you get it? Can't tell. Look in the light. Yeah. There it is. Yeah. There she is. That's a good one. You see it, Darrin? You guys, there's someone by our car. What? What? There's someone sneaking around our car. Where is he? Dude, he's right there, man. There's stuff in the car. Doesn't matter, it's not... What do you mean, it doesn't fucking matter? Come on, we gotta keep moving. We got stuff to do. Let's go. Where is he? I don't know. I don't see him. He's gone. Keep going. Just keep going. He's messing with us. Thermal cameras all around the base, and they pick up your body heat. So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna pump Freon through this suit. Fit in right here, and that'll mask our body temperature. Darrin, turn on the Freon and put on the thermal? Yep. Good. All right. - How's it looking? - It's looking good. You can see the Freon coming through. I can see your body cooling down, it's kinda cool. Only problem is, it's escaping through your head, so. All right. Let's try the mask. All right. It's helping. There we go. Good? Hey, hold on. Let him just tie it off. It's sweet. - Coming through her whole suit. - It's coming in? Her whole suit looks pretty good. It's like it is matching the outside. All right. It should all work then. We should probably bring along boots. Hold on to the ammonia sensor, we gotta check Jelena. Let's do it. Dude, let's go. What? I'm not doing it. What do you mean you're not gonna drive us? I'm not gonna drive you until you tell me why you're doing this. You know why we're doing this, they're hiding secrets out there. I need a better reason than that. I'm not gonna drive you there unless you tell me why you're doing this. You said you would do it. Yeah. I didn't know we were actually gonna get this far, Reid. I thought you were gonna snap out of it. You saw a light at a party, that's all I know. I don't really know. Something happened to me that night, all right? I just... A whole bunch of missing time, and I get these flashes, and... I don't know, something is pulling me towards the base. I can't explain it, okay? I just have to do it. I do. And I can't do it without you. So, please, can you just help me? Please. Please, help me. Let's go. Here. It's close, but I think you'll be good. Take this for your walkie. - You guys in? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I hear you. Now watch out for them, man. Don't let them do anything stupid. No, I'll be fine. All right. I'll be here. All right, guys, put on your masks. All right. Yeah. You see the Freon pumping through the suits. Good luck, man. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. I'll be here in the morning. Right. We'll see you then. Be safe. I'm gonna head this way, over that hill. All right, guys, this is it. Let's do it quickly. Holy shit. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. Guys, this way. Wait a minute. Guys, there's a fence. There's a fence. Yeah, right there. Straight ahead. - You see it? - Yeah. Shit. It's coming up all hot in the thermal camera. I think it's electric. It's on the way? Shit. We gotta go that way. You serious? This fence goes all the way to the right and all the way to the left. We gotta find a way under it. Let's keep looking. Look for a low, like, a ditch or something like that. Right here. I think we can get under it. All right, you're through. - Nice, okay. - Ready? Stay low, Reid. Am I clear? Yeah. Just stay low. Let's keep moving. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. Everyone, stop. Everyone, stop. You see that? The light. It's a car, we're fine. Look, they're just driving along the road. If we tripped their sensor, they'd be on us. Check the GPS. Okay, it's this way. Hey. Hey. It's okay. Just keep breathing. Are you okay? Can you breathe? Come on, let's go. What are you doing? Okay. I think we'll be getting close to the motion sensors. About six miles from the base. Jelena's right, we're getting close. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Twenty seconds, Stay there. Stay there. Reid. I think I got it. Come on. Come on. Reid, 15. Moving too fast. - Reid, hurry. - Five, four, three, two, one. All right. I think I got it, guys. Did you get it? Yeah, I got it. All right. All right, let's keep moving, guys. It's three miles that way. Almost there. Wait, guys. Stop. Stop. Shh, shh. You hear that? You hear that? What is it? Are those camo guys? The camo. You can tell. That doesn't look like them... Holy shit! It's a helicopter! Get down! Get down! Get down! Keep your head down. They can't see us in the thermal suits, okay? Stay down! Stay down! We're gonna be fine. Jelena, keep your head down. Stay low. Don't move. There's a snake. It's okay. It won't hurt you. Stay calm. It doesn't even know you're here. Is it gone? It's going away. It's going away. Relax, relax. Try to breathe. Just breathe. You guys, the helicopter, it's coming back. All right, guys, stay down. Be still, okay? Stay down. We're not gonna get caught. Stay low. Look, they're just doing a routine check. It's a standard procedure. God damn it. See? They're gone. Still, they definitely know we're here. No, it's a fly-over. They would've flown down on us. We're fine. They do it all the time. It's right over that ridge. There it is. Look. We fucking did it. - I told you we could do it. - We made it. We did it. We fucking did it. Reid, you were right. I mean, this is Area 51. This is the base. Darrin, you getting this? Yeah. This is a huge area. You see that area down there? That's where we're going. We gotta get down there and ditch the suits. There it is. We made it. I can't believe we did this. You sure we're okay without our suits? Yeah, we should be fine. They shouldn't have heat sensor cameras this close to the base. And security? Security should be low this time of night. Let's get inside there and get some footage. Reid? Reid? Reid, you all right? You good? Yeah, let's go. Looks like we're good here. But I'm gonna go up to the fence and check it out, okay? Do you realize what we're doing right now? I know. Do we just go? All right. Wait. He's over. He needs to signal us or something. No, no, no. Just wait. Just wait. He's almost over. Come on, hurry up. Here we are on the base. This is incredible. Darrin, check that way, I'll check this way. All right, Darrin, please get down. There's people everywhere. Stay low. Let's get over there. It's a car. Reid, you see that? - Fucking... - Damn it. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Just keep it down. Keep going. Keep going. Right. There's the split. All right, keep a look out, I'm gonna check the map. It's hangar number nine. Guys, we're fucking here... It's the hangar on the east end... East end? Let's get to that fence and don't freak out. - We're so close, all right? - Okay. - We gotta hurry. - Go. You need to get in the shadow here. Come get in. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can you see 'em? Okay. Their backs are turned. Now's time for us... Go! What's the plan? Okay. You go left. Okay. Okay. Going. All right. It's nine down. It's there? Yes. It's JANET planes. Shit. Shit. Okay. Okay. - I think they're leaving. - I think so. He's taking the car. He's taking the car. All right. I can't see anything. Look for a light on the wall. Here, I found it. Nothing in here. Look for doors to other rooms. You guys, this one opens. Oh, Reid, it looks like... Does this thing open? We use the fingerprint. Why isn't this working, come on. Maybe it needs my body heat. Go. Go. Shit. Stay behind me. The door just closed on us. Fuck. It's okay. Just keep going. Keep going. Level 40-A. We need level 40-A. Got it. I don't see anything. Where is it? Okay. Okay. Fuck. There's a guy out there. He's at his desk. He's by himself. Okay. We need to get to a stairwell. All right. - Dude, he's gone. - What? He's fucking gone. I have no idea where he is. - Did you see which way he went? - I have no idea... Come on. Come on. Let's... Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up... What the fuck? Okay, we're good. We're good. What is this? Comatose, nonresponsive behavior, marks on necks and arms? What the fuck. You guys, we got to get out of here. Shh. It's okay. Just... He didn't notice us. He's wearing headphones. Okay here. On 10. Yeah. We gotta find a way. We gotta get to a stairwell. Okay. There's an exit over there. There's an exit over there? Behind you, behind you. It's a dead end. Get down. Get down. Okay, we're clear. Get down. Shit! Shit. Shit. Go, go, go, go. Fuck, that was close. Dude, it goes way the fuck down there. This is Stairwell B. S4, it should be down there. - Let's keep moving. - Yep. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. Reid, he's coming. Reid. Reid, he's coming. There's a locker room. I think it's empty. Okay. He didn't see you, did he? No, no, no, no. I think we're good. Jesus Christ! Just wait it out for a minute. Let everything pass. - What the fuck is that? - Did you hear that? Must be automatic. Listen. What's that? - What is that? - Yeah. Where is it coming from? Here. - What is it? - I don't know. What the fuck. It's still here somewhere. It's here. They might be useful to know where the guards are. Also got some kind of suit. Bulletproof vest, almost. - What the hell? - Look at this. What the fuck? Are you okay? Dude, your nose is bleeding, are you okay? - Hey, let's go. - You okay? Jelena, put it back. Let's go. The stairs. Let's go. All right. I think we're good. Dude, what was that noise? I don't know. Let's keep moving. Dude. I can't see anything. This is it. Level 40. Where are you going? This is fucking... It's huge. Shit. Look at this. It's fucking... What is this? Are these cages? What the fuck? Yeah, they look like holding cells. Dude! Oh my God, it's weird. Oh! They're hot, they're hot. Dude, it's fucking warm. That's weird. Darrin, check this out. Holy shit. What is this? That's weird. What do you think's in there? It's like they're getting sucked in. Come on. We gotta keep moving. Let's go. We gotta get through the lab to get to the access point for S2. Oh, fuck. Go hide. Get down. What's he doing? I think he's going to the lab. Is he still out there? I don't know the code. It's not a card. I have an idea. With the thermal. Yeah. Okay, now. Maybe the thermal... What do you mean? Watch. I turn it on. Now, the last button he pushed would be the warmest. Eight must have been pushed first, and then the seven, and then the three, and then the four, okay? So that means what? 4-3-7-8. Right. Fuck! You're a fucking genius! Go! It's a lab. My dad always talked about these R&D labs. - Look at this shit. - Whoa. - My God. - Whoa, this is... What? Holy shit. Look at this. Anti-gravity. This is huge. I knew it. My God, I knew he wasn't crazy. - My dad was right. - I knew it. Why are they hiding this here? Dude, there's white blood in there. We gotta go. We don't know that it's blood. I know, but remember the guy at the bar mentioned that. Yeah, maybe that's it, I don't know. Okay. Guys, we should get moving. - No. - Where? Reid, this is the first thing we've seen. - Let me get some footage. - Hold on a sec. There's more over here. Jelena, look at this. There's more over here. What the fuck? What? Are you seeing this? It's the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life. Look at this. Reid, come here, man. Check this shit out. Darrin, come over. Check this out. Guys, you gotta come see this. Guys, this thing's going crazy. Reid, look at this. Look at this. Oh! Fuck. What the fuck? I don't know. What was that? Fuck! You guys, we gotta get the hell out of here. You all right? - Shit. - Reid, we need to go. What was that? Someone heard that, right? You all right? We gotta get out of here, come on. Guys, we gotta go, yeah. Let's go. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Darrin. Come here, come here. Darrin, come on. That thing just flew. The rock flew? What the hell was that? Holy shit. Darrin, Darrin. Look for a door. No fucking way. Holy shit. - You think it's real? - Look at this. I don't know. I gotta get a closer look. Holy shit. Wonder how long they've had this here. That's crazy. Do you realize how many people would want to see this? I can't believe I'm filming this right now. Look at this. This is incredible. - So how did they fly this... - Guys! Guys! Come, check this out. You gotta see this, this is crazy. Look. Oh, my God. Holy shit. That was incredible. It's definitely not... From this planet. That's incredible. It's not doing anything for me. This is not military technology. This is something else. Dude, I gotta get in here. Hold on, I think there's an opening up here. Amazing. I'm gonna go in. Reid, you don't know what's in there. It's okay. I'll be fine. Okay, just be careful, dude. Easy, easy. Holy shit. - What? - Jelena, it closed. What do you mean, it closed? I mean, the door, the hatch, it closed. Just, he climbed in and it closed right behind him. I don't... It's just not there anymore. What are they? They look like sleeping pods. There's like nothing in here. Why there's, like, no controls or anything? I can't believe I'm in an alien spacecraft. Check this out. Whoa! Darrin. My God, it's completely soundproof. This is amazing. Well, is there, like, a... Like, a button or something? I don't know. It's just... It's all smooth. It's nothing. It's nothing. Come on, what the fuck? What is he doing? Hey! You guys! You guys, this is amazing! How did I do this? Reid. Darrin. You all right? Darrin, man, you gotta get down here. - This is amazing. - No, we gotta go, man. No. I'm not leaving. Could you guys see me? - No we couldn't see you. - Reid, come on. Dude, the whole thing went transparent. No, man, it was completely soundproof. All right, we gotta go. Reid, if that door closes again, we're stuck here. Let's go. All right. Here. Here. You okay? I told you guys it would be here, I told you that. Let's go, Reid. There's gotta be more. - I was just inside that thing. - I know. We got it all on tape. Let's go. They definitely heard us. They're gonna seal that shutter down. What the fuck was that back there? Think about it. That was definitely not from this planet. I know. Exactly. We have enough footage. We have to look for an exit. We gotta keep going. This is what we talked about. You're talking way too loud, someone's gonna hear us. Quiet. Careful, careful. - Here, come on. - Guys, we can't stop. I know, I know. Check them out. Somebody's gonna see us. Check it out. It's this way. Let's go. Go, go. Reid, look up. Are you okay? Yeah. Come on. Darrin, you with us? Yeah, it's all right. Let's go. Come on, we'll be running for miles. Just look for an opening. Fuck. Look. This is that. Holy shit, you're right. Come on. Let's go. This is gotta be it. - You good? - Come on, Darrin. We're clear. What's up? Wait. Wait. What's wrong? Do you hear that? Hear what? Just... We gotta go, we gotta go. Come on. Keep moving. You okay? - We're close. - Okay. Dude, stop. Reid, there's a fucking camera. There's someone here, come on. Reid, this is bullshit. We gotta go. Come on, we gotta go. Darrin, I'm not leaving now. We've come this far. Come on, we'll get the fuck out of here. My God, man. Security's gonna come down here and see us. Stop... It's the fingerprint scanner. Hurry. Fuck. Fuck. Okay, it's okay, Darrin. It's gonna detect my pulse. Go, go! Come on, follow me. - Fuck. Fuck. - Okay. - What was that? - It's a failsafe. Someone has to turn that thing on. I'll do it, I'll do it. All right. Jelena, come on. - Go. - Come on. What the fuck? Darrin, come on. Darrin! Okay, what do I do? What do I do? - Listen, are you okay? - Go! Go, they're coming! Get out of here! - Fuck. Fuck. - Hey! - You! Freeze! - Shit, shit. - Get down! Get down! - Freeze! Oh, God. Security breach S4. Security breach S4. Get out! Security breach. Security breach. Dude, I can't see anything. Hold on. Let me get the flashlight. What about Darrin? He's going back to the car. We'll meet him there. Fuck. What? What the fuck? What's going on? Don't go over there. They're just hanging there. What? Just hanging, they're not real. I don't get it. They're rubber. Maybe... Maybe they wear it when they go out on Earth, I don't know. You know, like, an astronaut wears on the moon. They're not real. It's moving. Where the fuck are we going? God, I can't believe... And it's not opening, that's great. That's fucking creepy. What is this place? Your dad talked about this. He said they had all these tunnels down here. Oh, it smells down here. What if there's someone down here? Okay. Let's try to keep quiet. There's nothing in here. Wait, why are these, down here? No. Oh, my God. Glasses. Shoe. It's a little girl's shoe. - Oh, my God. - Reid. Why are there clothes down here? What are they doing here? This isn't right. Come on, stay close. Oh, God. Oh, God. This is fucked up. It's like some fucking twisted playroom. Oh, God. I used to have this doll. Why do they have this shit? They bring them... I need to get out of here. Jelena, hold on. Stay close to me. Oh, my God. There's fresh blood. Oh, fuck. Don't look in there. Can we get out of this room? Yeah. I think I need to get out of here. Okay. Oh, my God. Okay. We gotta find another way out. Maybe there's another way out through this room. These are the same pods that were in the spacecraft. Reid. Do you think we should be in here? Oh, my God. There are dozens down here. There could be a whole colony of them. Reid, one of them's open. Shit. We need to get out of here. Okay. Oh! Fuck. Come on, run, run. Go! Go! Find a place to hide! Reid! Reid! What? What? Do you hear that? No. - You don't hear that? - No. Shh, Shh. Reid... Let's get out here. Let's go. Come on, come on. Go on. Come on, come on. Come on, hurry. Hurry, come on. We gotta go. We gotta get the fuck out of here. What the fuck? What was that? We're going to get out of here. Okay? Flashlights not working. I'm gonna try on night vision. What is this? We gotta find a way. This is nothing, it's a box. What is this thing? What? Don't... Don't... Don't touch it. What the fuck is this shit? Here. Pull that, pull that. What? - Fuck. I can't hold it. - Okay. That. Okay. Okay. Okay, leave the hatch open. You okay? Yeah. I just wanna get the fuck out of here. We're gonna have to rely on the night vision, okay? There's gotta be another way out. - Oh, my God. - God. We'll go out this way. Let's go. Easy. We need to get out of here. Come on, follow me. You okay? No. Okay! Okay, I've got it. Move, move, move! Freeze! Freeze! Turn around! Whoa, whoa! Hey, it was chasing me! - Put your hands up! - Turn around! It's chasing me, it's right behind you! Turn around! Fuck. Okay. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Fuck. What the fuck? Fuck! What the fuck? Okay. - Damn. - Shit. Where are we going? Just keep going. Just stay close. Point the camera over there. 'Cause I can't really see where I'm going. Yeah, yeah. What? What? What is it? Go back that way. Why? Back that way, please. Oh, my God. Hold on. Jelena, hold on. What? What's wrong? I... What? The floor. What about it? I got you. Damn it. Reid! Where is this? What is this place? Oh, God. God, I don't like this. What is this stuff? Skins. You, what? This one seems fresh. We need to get out of here. I can't see anything. Reid, what's that noise? Reid. Come on, give me the camera, stay behind me. We'll get out here, stay together. Okay. Where is that sound coming from? Come on! God! Run! Run! Run, run! These symbols on the wall. Do you see them? Look. Look. Reid? Stay behind me. Look at this. These are the same symbols as the ones your dad drew. Do you see them? Jelena... Jelena? Jelena? Jelena? What the fuck? Jelena! Jelena! Jelena! Jelena! Jelena! Okay. Okay. Shit. Go! Fuck. Fuck. Oh, God. I don't know... I don't know where the fuck they... I don't know where Ben is. Ben... Jelena? Jelena! Come on, where are you? Jelena! Jelena! Jelena. Jelena, come on. Jelena, we gotta get out of here, come on. Jelena? Jelena. Jelena. Jelena? Jelena? Jelena? Jelena... Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Jelena? No! No, Jelena! No! Jelena! No! Jelena! Fuck! No! Fuck. Ben! Ben. Fuck. Ben! Ben! Wake up. Start the car! Star the car. Come on, go. Go. Go. Go. Darrin, what's going on, man? What... Where is Reid and Jelena, man? I don't know, man. Just drive, dude. Wait. What? Hold on. Someone was chasing me. They're behind us? Yes! They're after us! Okay, I'm fucking going! We have to go! What... Can you tell me what happened?
